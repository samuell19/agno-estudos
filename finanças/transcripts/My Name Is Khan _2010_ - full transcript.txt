No, no, no. What is your message, Mr. Khan? I have to say to him … My name is Khan. And I am not a terrorist. May Allah bless this letter I'm writing to you. The book 'Different Minds' says … … that people like us can't express their emotions in words. But we can write them easily. I can fill thousands of pages, millions of times with … 'I love you, Mandira.' But not once could I say it to you. Perhaps that's why you are angry with me. I had promised you that I would meet the President … … so, my attempts are on. Meanwhile whenever I have time, I will write all … … that I couldn't say to you. And then, you will love me again. My Abbu (father) Dilawar Amanullah Khan worked for … … the S.T. workshop in Borivali. He took me with him to work everyday. And left me to play in the garage. I know how to repair broken things since then. Strangely, I could never repair Abbu. Hey, is this your dad's place? Go home and kill your time. Kill? Kill? Get out now! Out! You fool! Idiot! Ruined my clothes! Ammi … Ammi … Ammi … Zakir is sleeping. What's this? 'Kill time.' - How did you get so wet? 'Kill time.' I want to 'kill time.' - What? Abdul Workshop asked me to go home and 'kill time.' How do I do that? 'Kill time?' Is that what the devil told you? Okay. I'll teach you how to 'kill time.' Like this. Like this. This way. Come on, Rizu. Give me a hug … just once? Come on. Come on. My Ammi (mother) Razia Khan. I feel peace when you hug me. She was from Jalalpur, UP. She embroidered clothes. No doctor could tell her why I was the way I was. But Ammi … She never felt the need to know why. I don't know how, but she found a way to know me. Just like you. Fools! All of them!! Each one of them should be shot dead mercilessly! Didn't even spare our women! Dogs! Rogues! Idiots! Are you guys with me? Rogues. All of them. Each one of them should be shot dead mercilessly.

And he gives it to you. Lollipop is sweet. It's a good thing. Good boy. - Good boy. Now, tell me which one of these is a Hindu and which one, a Muslim? Both look alike. Good. Remember one thing, son. There are only two kinds of people in this world. Good people who do good deeds. And bad people who do bad. That's the only difference in human beings. There's no other difference. Understood? What did you understand? Tell me. Tell me. Good people. Bad people. No other difference. Ammi's lesson was not taught in any school. Not in my school at least. Master Wadia lives somewhere here. Give me the map. Come fast. Rizu, what are you doing? Stop that and come here. Hang on. Coming. Hello. I'm Razia. This is Rizu. I mean Rizvan. I have heard a lot about you. That you are a very learned man. You have a lot of degrees. B.A., M.A. Whatever! But people say you don't do anything. That's a good thing! Rizu. My Rizu is a sharp boy. So, I thought if you agree to teach him here, in your house That way, you can pass your time too, isn't it? What nonsense! Mr. Wadia. Mr. Wadia. Trust me. My Rizu is an intelligent boy. Rizu … Talk to Mr. Wadia in English. Speak in English. Come on. Say something in English. Wadia. Wadia. Wadia family is a Parsi family originally based in Surat. Launji Narsolaunji Wadia started the Wadia ship … … building dynasty in 1736. When he obtained a contract from the British East India Company … … for building docks and ships in Bombay. Wadia. Wadia.

The water had filled till here. - Mother! One minute! The water was till here. Rizu fixed some motor type of thing. One minute! Put the motor in the water, and the water was gone! I saw it with my own eyes. Really? - Yes. Zakir. You won a cup, didn't you? I'm really happy about that. And Rizu? Even he is happy for you. You should be happy too. He is your brother, isn't he? Good boy. Wipe your tears. Come on. You are my good son, aren't you? You are my good son, aren't you? You are my good son, aren't you? Zakir was fortunate. He could cry. Zakir, Rizu says it's going to be very cold there. You have taken everything, right? Don't forget anything. I will miss you, my son. Only if you find time from bhai (brother) will you miss me! As soon as he completed 18 years, Zakir left for America. He got a scholarship at Michigan University. I felt very bad when he left. But I never told him. And in just a few days, I got accustomed to his absence. Ammi. Hasina teaches at the university. She can't leave mid-term and come. It's her first Eid (festival) in the family after the wedding. We haven't even seen her yet. Come here, please. Ammi. Don't worry. Your immigration will be done in a few days. Then you will live with us. I won't go anywhere without Rizvan. I know that. I'm sponsoring bhai as well. Okay, Ammi. I have to hang up now. I'll call later. Yeah? Oh, Lord. - Oh, lord. Ammi, you should sleep now. Sleeping calms the mind and provides rest to the body. Shut up! Nothing is wrong with me. Just missing Zakir, that's all. His laughter. His anger. The sound of his gargling. At 7 a.m. At 2 p.m. 9 p.m. Enough peace? Please, Rizu. Two minutes? Only two minutes. Only two minutes? 1001, 1002. But Mandira, the effect of those two minutes … … lasted only for six months, four days and 17 hours. Ammi died of congestive cardiomyopathy. Her heart became too big for its own good. Before dying, Ammi made me promise … … that like Zakir, I would make a happy life for myself. That I would go to America. And then I came here to your favourite city. San Francisco. And it was scary. Very scary. Bhai, this is Hasina. Hello, bhai. How are you? Hope your flight was comfortable. - Hello. Come on. Let's go in. Hello to you too. Zakir's wife, Hasina. She was from Brooklyn, New York. She taught psychology in the university here. She was the first to find out … … that I had Asperger's Syndrome.

Take this. When you look through this it will be like watching TV. TV? This way, you won't be scared of new places or roads. Not scared? - No. Just press this button. See … try?

For the family of the fire-fighters who died saving people during 9/11. Hi. - Hi. How is it going? - Good, good. The Johnson's just gave a thousand dollars. Wow. Thank you. Oh, God. - Here. 3500 dollars. It's annual Zakat (religious tax) money. It's a duty in Islam. Duty, duty, duty. In Islam they donate a certain percentage of their … … income each year in charity. - Yes. This year, how could it be anything else? Yes, that's $3502 and 50 cents exactly. In the western world, history is marked simply by BC and AD. But now, there is a third distinction. 9/11. Reports are in from various parts of America that … … Muslims are being targeted and attacked. Back off. Get away. A Sikh employee in Michigan was shot dead by his employer … … because he was mistaken for an Afghani. In the wake of 9/11, a lot of American Muslims are changing … … their names to escape racial profiling. Questions are being raised about America's biased views … … towards the Islamic community. Even as Muslim women wearing hijabs (veils) are being targeted. Post 9/11, America's view towards its Islamic inhabitants … … is changing rapidly. They must be getting late. Let's mom drop you today. And we'll grab an ice-cream on the way. - Yeah. Come on. Of all the religions in the world … … Islam is the most violent and aggressive. It encourages killing or 'Jihad' as they call it, in the name of God. Sam, you need to tell your mom about this. - No, Reese. I think she already has too much to worry about. Get out of my country. Don't wear this now. Allah will understand. These people won't. Never. Yes? I'm Mandira. I heard about Hasina, so … She is upstairs, bhabi (sister-in-law). He won't come in. Bhai, please come in. Please. You are my good son, aren't you? You are my good son, aren't you? Alright, Mandira, you'll join us on Monday. Thank you so much. I just want to clarify one thing. My last name is Khan, my husband is Muslim. We'll see you on Monday. - Thanks. Khan. I got the job, I got the job. - Okay. I got the job. - Okay. Now, everything will be all right. We'll do it. We'll do it. - I know. We'll do it. - We'll do it. Yes, yes, yes. - We shall overcome? We shall overcome? We shall overcome. We shall overcome. You suck. You suck. Please don't sing. We shall overcome. I know, Mandira, we will … I'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to meet the President. His motorcade has 12 cars … … but no one tells me which car the President is in. Mandira, I don't know why, but I keep failing to meet the President. But I know I have to meet him. I have to tell him about Sam. Sam. Khan. So there you guys are. So, how was your day? Again Xbox? Make place for me, make place for me. Don't hug me mom. - Come here, sweety. Don't hug me. And how are you sweetheart? - No, no don't hug me, don't hug me, no. Phone. - I know. But I'll be back. - Why? Because you've no choice. Hello. Hey Sarah. Mark's being sent to cover the war, in Afghanistan. Reese, pass Mrs. Khan the salad. Sam, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Sarah, we are fine. I'm fine. Rizvan, how is the chicken? Do you like it? No, not at all. Did I … did I say a joke? Yes you did, Rizvan. And a very good one indeed. - Thank you Mark. But the chicken is not good. It's a new recipe. I … - Don't make it ever again. Mark was going to cover the war in Afghanistan, Mandira. Ammi was right. Families are not just made by blood. They are made with love too. Sarah, Mark and Reese had become a part of our world. But I never told them that … I should have told them. Take care, buddy. See you, Reese. - Take care, Reese. Hey, Reese. In chapter five, verse 32 of the Quran, Allah has decreed that … … the death of one innocent is equal to the death of humanity. I knew that the death of innocents in 9/11 … … would cost the entire humanity. But I did not know that you and I would have to pay … … the biggest price, Mandira. Why did this happen to us, Mandira? Why? Reese. Just talk to me man. Wait a minute. Why are you ignoring me, Reese? Its been so many days since … Reese, listen to me. Wait a minute. Please listen to me man. What's the problem? What have I done? Reese, just listen to me. - Piss off. Listen to me. Hello. I have got new shoes for you. Pele Shoe Stores, 34/99. Try them. Not now. - Return policy, only fourteen days. Try now. - Not now. No, no try now, try now. I said not now. - Okay. Okay. Return policy, only fourteen days. Okay. Hey. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled. - Yes, very loud. Very, very loud. Not nice, not nice. - Khan. Khan, please don't be angry with me. I don't have any friends apart from you. Liar. Liar. Reese is your friend. He's your friend. - Right. You're a liar. He's your friend. Cool shoes. - Thank you. Can I try them? - No. Please. - No, please. Want to play? - No. I'll beat you. I'll kick your butt. - Oh, you'll kick my butt. You suck. - I suck.

Do you have to play soccer? Do you have to cut hair? Very clever. The apple of my eye! Love me till I die! Sam. Sam. Why is Sam walking so strangely? Why are you laughing so strangely? You're too cute. - No, no. You're too cute. - No, no, please, please. Please, don't hug me. - Khan, please. No, no. - Khan, please. No, no, please. Please, don't hug me. November 27, 2007. 8:23 a.m. I still remember the day … That's the last time I heard you laugh. Reese. Reese. Reese, you haven't spoken in eight days now. What's up? - Just leave me alone. What's with you? You know I loved your dad. Just … don't talk about my dad. Come on, Reese, we're best friends. Our moms are best friends. You know what you people are nobody's best friends. All you people care is about your damn 'Jihad' or whatever. What are you talking about man? Reese, just listen to me. - Just go away. No, Reese, you listen … - Shut up, and go! - Listen. Sameer, I said go away. - Listen to me man. Just go away. Look at those two little brats. Hey, ladies, come on time out. Come on. Didn't you hear him? He said "Leave him alone". So why don't you go home to your mummy. Stay out of it. - What? I said, stay out of it. - What did you say? You heard me, stay out of it. Jim, let him go. - What's the matter? Don't you care about your dead dad? - Yeah, but … Is Osama your lover? - Let him go. So … dead. Stop it guys, you're hurting him. Oh, he liked that one. What did he just do. Let's get him guys. Hey, Osama's son. Bloody Paki. Get away. Get away. Screw you assholes - What did you say? Screw you. Sameer. Come on buddy, get up. Sameer. Sameer, come on. Sameer. Sameer. Oh, shit. - Come on. This didn't happen, okay. This didn't happen this didn't happen. Or else … Do you hear me? Mrs. Khan. I'm detective Garcia. I need to ask you some questions about this? Later. - Let's get him into the ER. Is the trauma team ready? - Yes, they are … Lip discolouration … discolouration of the face. How is his pulse? - Rapid pulse. Possible internal bleeding. Possible spleen rupture. What's going on? - We got to do this fast, you guys. He's losing blood. I think we got to give him blood. We got to do this fast. Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture. Go, go, go. Ma'am, you need to stay out. Okay, what've we got here, what've we got? No signs of internal bleeding. Give me vitals. Heart is throbbing extremely low. - Okay. Okay, defib now. - He's technicardiac. Give me the defib. - Ready for defib. Okay, we're going to shock in 200. Ready now. Clear. 200. One, two, three … clear. - Still no pulse. Okay go to 300. Clear. Still no pulse, doctor. We lost him. Time of death, 8:05 p.m. Sam. Ruptured spleen … spleen. It's the only part of the human body … … the use of which is not known to doctors. When the capsule containing the spleen is ruptured … … a splenectomy is performed, and the spleen is removed. But that can lead to pneumococcal infection. He's dead. He's dead. The splenic … artery is clamped. - Time of death, 8:05 p.m. Time of death, 8:05 p.m. Time of death, 8:05 p.m. Time of death, 8:05 p.m. Sam. Come back to me. Come back to me, baby. Come back to me, baby. Don't leave me. Don't leave me, please. Come back to me please. Please come back. Please. Come back to me, Sam. Sam, come back. Don't leave me. I apologise for the late hour. But 48 hours is our best window to catch the attackers. - Yeah. Now, I've gone through the medical examiner's reports. The attack on your son seems very personal Mrs. Khan. It happened at the community soccer field. Inspector Garcia told us that our Sam's death … … may have been a racial attack. His wounds were proof of that. He was a Muslim, so he was killed. But I couldn't understand. Being a Muslim is not a bad thing, Mandira. Sam. My baby. Mandira … We killed him. Mandira … We killed him. We killed him. Mandira … Let's go home. We killed him. It's time for dinner. Doctors say that post-traumatic disorder causes people … … to ignore their health. Both of us killed him. - You need to take care of your health. Just shut up, just shut up. Are you listening to what I am saying? We killed him! It's all my fault. If I hadn't married you … … all this wouldn't have happened. I thought you loved me so much. Loved Sam so much. What difference would it make if his name is changed? What difference would it make … … if a 'Khan' was added to his name? But I was wrong. It makes a difference. It does make a difference. I should never have married a Muslim man! If Sam had been a Rathod (Hindu), he would have been alive today. He was a Khan, so, he died. He died because of you. Because of your surname! I don't understand what you are saying. I don't understand what you are saying. You are not well. God. I want to die. - Oh, no, no, no, no. I want to die. No, no, no Mandira please don't die. No, no, please don't die. You can't die. Please don't die. Just leave me alone, please. Leave me please. I don't even want to see you. Whenever I see you I remember Sam's wounds. I can't do this. I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving you, Khan. I'm leaving you! Why should you leave? The house is yours. I will leave. Go right now! This instant! Go right now. Go! Go! Mandira … When should I come back? When should you be back? When should you be back? You know Banville? It has a population of 30,000. And each one of those 30,000 people hates you. Tell all of them that you are not a terrorist. Why only them? Tell every person in America. Can you do that? Can you? No, you can't. Why don't you tell the President of United States then? Mr. President, my name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist. So, he can tell all these people … … that my Sam was not the terrorist son of a terrorist father. He was just a baby. My baby. When you do that … … come back. Come back then! Mr. President, my name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist. My name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist. Not a terrorist. Mandira, I felt a stab of pain in my chest when I left you. I thought it was chest congestion. But no amount of ginger juice could make the pain go away. It's still there. Bhabhi, whatever you said then was said in anger. It was Sam's grief that made you say it. We all know you love him a lot. Then why don't you … - There is no space for love in my life right now. Love will weaken me. Hate will help me fight this battle. And I have to fight for Sam. I can't be Khan's wife right now. I'm just a mother whose son has been killed. I've had a long day, and I've sold enough tickets. I'll have to call you back, alright. For dinner with the president is $500 you know. That's … that's 500. What church are you from? - Church? Church? This is a Christian's only event. But … but it says, it's a fund raiser for the draught in Africa. For Christians, honey. Honey, Honey keep it. For those are not Christian in Africa. Honey. Honey, feed Africa. Offer it to him as well? Excuse me, would you like to have some? What's your name? - Rizvan Khan. Khan. I'm Imran and this is Sajida. Where are you off to? It's time for the bus to leave. Prayer time. Prayer time? Now? Here? You should pray depending upon the place and the people around. No. No, no. Prayer should never depend upon the place or the people. It should depend only on your belief. My God, my knee. Oh my God, my knee is bleeding. I'm sorry, but I can't repair your knee. But can you at least help me please. - Help? Oh, yes I can do that. Okay, thanks. Joel, that better be you. Hello. You are an angel. You've saved my baby. He could've been out there lying, bleeding. Oh, thank you, thank you. You little frisky thing, aren't you? - Please don't hug me. Alright. - That's my Mama Jenny. Always trying to hug everyone. - Mama Jenny, please don't hug me. Joel Izale Williams. I told you not take that bicycle out. Now off to bed with you. - Yes, ma'am. You. You Mr. Repair man. - Rizvan. Rizvan. Oh, you hungry child? You want little dinner? No, I want lots of dinner. First we've got to get you out of those clothes. You want me to be naked? - No, no, no. Just get this cleaned up, that's all. Funny hair Joel and his Mama Jenny are good people. Mama Jenny is strict and a little fat too. But I like her. Mama Jenny's elder son, James … … was killed two months ago in the Iraq war. But he loved his country. Mama Jenny too asked me about Sameer. Sam has been gone for 179 days … … and for the first time, someone made a mention of him to me. Poor baby. Poor baby. Mama Jenny and Funny Hair Joel live in Wilhemina … … Tarrow County, Georgia. This small town has 204 people and 754 cows exactly. All the people here work at the dairy farm. And pray at the Church Of Rock. Today, there's a memorial service for all the soldiers killed in Iraq. Mama Jenny has added Sameer's name to the list of martyrs. Mama Jenny said by remembering and talking about them … … we can get closer to them. Letters just stopped. My mom's never been the same, she cries all the time. I loved my brother so much, and I just want him to know … … if he's out there, that I miss him. He's always … I too tried to get closer to Sam. Sameer Rathod Khan, my son. Weight 56 kilogram, blood group O positive. Sameer loved Xbox and soccer. He loved his soccer shoes so much that he would sleep in them. That was the only bad habit he had. Sam was six years old when I married his mother. Sameer was a good son. He did not mind sharing his mom's love with me. But I couldn't be such a good dad to him. Other dads sense their children's unsaid needs and fulfil them. But I can't sense unexpressed feelings. So, I couldn't fulfil them. But … but, Sam never complained. He never complained. Sam had one more bad habit. He told us only good things. He always hid bad news from us. He would never tell me when my favorite … … team Manchester United lost. Never. Unless we had a bet. Then he would tell me. Then I would I have to give him his mint chocolate-chip ice cream. Two scoops. Two scoops, always. Two scoops. On 27th November 2007, he was killed. He was 13 years, nine months and four days old. Sameer was not only my son, he was my dearest friend. Actually, my only friend. My … My … only best friend. I'm sure Allah is happy that Sam is with him in heaven. I … Mama Jenny, I don't know what to say. I don't want to say anymore. Come on, Rizvan. Okay. - Okay. Bye. Bye, Rizvan. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Okay, okay bye. God bless you, my son. What do you mean you're shutting the case? Understand it's been six months. Okay, no witnesses, no suspects, no evidence. There's been no movement on this case, Mrs. Khan. Look, I really have no choice. But you know, maybe … maybe there's somebody at school … … who will remember something. You know, maybe you can go door to door, class to class. Door to door and homes, and something … You know I've done that already. - But, you know … Maybe there's something else that you'll find. You see these files? These are all those waiting for justice too. Look, I'm sorry, Mrs. Khan. I truly am. Sometimes there really are no answers. - No. I don't accept that. I do not accept that. There has to be an answer. And if you can't find it, I will. Hi. - Hi. I'm looking for any lead on the boys who killed my son. Any information at all. My number is there. - Okay. I have reached Los Angeles now. The President is coming visit the college campus here. I have reached three days before him … … so that I don't miss him this time around. I am going to pray that Allah wills it so too. Listen, listen, listen brothers. We are digressing. I have said it before. I have no problem with Christians or the Jews. In fact, I have no problems with our Hindu brothers too. I treat a lot of Hindu patients in St. Benedict's hospital. I get angry only when this same grace … … is not reciprocated towards us Muslims. My blood boils … … when Israeli Jews massacre our Palestinian brothers. Or when Hindus in India … … cut our women and children to pieces with their swords. That's when my blood boils. Doesn't your blood boil? Answer me. Doesn't your blood boil? - It does. It does. It does. It does. So, do something then. Do something! I, Dr. Faisal Rehman, take an oath that I'm ready. Are you people ready? Are you? Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are. Are you people ready? Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are. Mighty Allah had even asked Ibrahim to sacrifice his son. And without asking a single question, Ibrahim agreed to sacrifice him. It's our turn today. It's our duty to let our blood flow for the cause of Islam. This is what Allah demands! This is what Islam demands! No, no, no, no. No. You are lying. Wait … Wait … Why, brother? Don't you believe that the Lord had asked for Ismail's sacrifice? No, no. My Ammi has told me the story. Saint Ibrahim did not doubt the compassion of the Lord. No, no, no. No. The story is an example of his immense strong faith and belief. And that's the reason … … why despite being incited by a stranger repeatedly … … Saint Ibrahim did not waver from his path of righteousness. No. He didn't listen to the stranger. He was sure Allah would never allow the blood of his progeny to be shed. And he was right. The mighty Allah saved Ismail's life. My Ammi also said, "Rizvan … … this story shows that the path of Allah is that of love … … not of hatred and war." You are lying. Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar. - You are lying. Look. The meaning of the story is clear. Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar. - Our brother here speaks the truth. Allah's path is that of compassion. That's why his loved ones are called 'blessed by the compassionate!' Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar. Ask him who was that stranger? I'm not lying! You are lying! Our times demand … - Ask him … The stranger who tried to veer Ibrahim from his path … … was he an infidel? How does it matter who he was? But Doctor, who was he? Listen I can explain everything. Brother, tell us who he was. Satan! Satan! Satan! The world is strange, Mandira. The more I try to understand it the lesser I understand. I miss you. Hello. - Hello. Bhai … You? Where are you? FBI. Do you have a number for the FBI? FBI? Why? Please. It's our college, and they are pushing us around. I wonder why they are so excited. That too for this President. Lousy pods of garlic! I love it. There are no better cusswords than Indian ones. - Really. Boys and girls. Come on. This is the man you waited for hours to see. Let's give him a warm round of applause. I present to you, the man, the legend. The president of the United States of America. Alright, yes. Alright, come on everybody. Let's give this guy a nice warm round of applause … … for his esteemed support. And there he is. Alright everybody, alright. Everybody, make some noise. President. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President. My name Khan, and I'm not a terrorist. Mr. President. My name Khan, and I'm not a terrorist. Did he just say terrorist? I'm not a terrorist. - Terrorist! He says he's a terrorist. - I'm not a terrorist. Move. Don't move. I got him. Don't move, man. Don't move. Keep your hands where I can see them. My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist. I don't understand. He is strange. First, he was standing silently. Then all of a sudden, he was screaming. And what was he screaming … I'm not a terrorist. I'm not a terrorist. Strange. There's something more to his story. Yes. But why are we after this story? Listen, Raj. This can't be our project. I don't want to get into this Khan story. I'm scared. Scared because he is a Khan? If he was a Khanna, you wouldn't be, right? What do you mean? You know what I'm saying, Komal. Listen, this is going to be my project. Are you with me? He's been following the President for some weeks now. And we … frankly can't know whether he's a 'Jihadi' or not. I have made a mistake again, Mandira. And now, the President is angry with me. He has even told the judge about it. That's why the judge has asked me to be shut away. He has also ordered that I should meet a psychiatrist. He says he will meet me after that. I will tell him then that I'm not an enemy. I'm not evil. I am unable to say anything now, Mandira. I'm very scared. His name is Rizvan Khan. - Rizvan Khan. - Yes. They are not saying anything beyond that right now. I knew the police wasn't going to tell us anything … Now? Now what? There are other ways of finding out. Come on, let's go. Guys, you know this is illegal. Yes. And you never do anything illegal, right? Here. Complete information on Rizvan Khan. House, work address, social security number. Credit records, salary statement. In short, his entire life! Wow, dude, Inder you're a rockstar. - Yes, thanks. Bye. - Okay, okay, okay. Stay out of jail. Yeah, I'll call you back. Bye. Yeah, I'm telling you, it's a great piece for your paper, okay. This man, Rizvan Khan, is a simple guy. He sells beauty products for a living. Listen. He's no enemy combatant. That's what you think. I just interviewed an extremist in a Kabul prison last year. He was just a tailor. There's no story here, bud. This place is strange, Mandira. There are no windows to any room and the bathrooms don't have a door. And the toilet has a lock. My eyes burn and I feel sleepy too. At times, it's very hot here. At other times, it is very cold. I told them I would repair their air conditioner … … but they won't let me. They don't even tell me the time so that I can pray. That's why every time I feel scared … I bow and pray. Oh, sorry guys, sorry. Give me two minutes, okay. Look, I've looked over the details. I'm not really interested, but … … why don't you try Bobby Ahuja, at PBC. He might able to help you. Okay. Alright. But why? Why do you want to meet the President? Why do you know so much about the President? Why were you reading up on the President? Do you know these people? Azhar Mahmood, Omar Khan … I think they are angry … … because I'm not able to answer their questions about the Al Qaeda. But I don't know anything about them. Mandira, I should have read up on Al Qaeda before. Why? Why were you at the Rally? Okay, what? It's time for his session with me. As ordered by the judge. Do you really buy this, "My wife told me to meet the President" shit?" Would it matter if I said yes? Hello. - Hi. Raj. - Raj, Bobby Ahuja. Please sit. I didn't have your number or I would have called to tell you that … … I can't cover the Rizvan Khan story. I have a busy schedule. I have no time for another two months. You know otherwise, you know I would've done something. But … you know what I mean? If you don't mind me asking, sir. Was this photograph taken before 9/11? Yes. Why? What's so funny? No, it's not funny at all actually. They confused a Sikh for a Muslim and you changed your entire life. And here, they are not even treating a Muslim like a human … … and you aren't able to change your schedule? Thank you for your time, sir. You have one new message. Hi Raj, this is Bobby Ahuja from PBC. Don't forget to watch the news tomorrow. My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist. Mr. President. Rizvan Khan of Banville California was arrested … … on June 15th at the CLA Presidential Rally. He has been accused of being a terrorist … … and has been jailed for the last 15 days. Without any evidence. And without legal representation. And today, we have with us Mr. and Mrs. Zakir Khan. Family of Rizvan Khan. Imran, the Khan from the bus is on PBC. Quick, switch on the TV! Very angry and very upset. I mean, how can anyone call him a terrorist? That too without any evidence. Tell them how last month Bhai called for the FBI. Bhai had called last month. He wanted the number for the FBI. He wanted to report some terrorist recruiter called, Dr. Faisal Rehman. Yo, how's business, asshole? Fuck you. I mean we're told to report suspicious characters. Participate in … protecting the country from extremists. And then when we do that … … we're just put into the jail, like my brother. Yeah, this is judge Preston, can you give me the FBI please? The question over here is, not why he's trying to meet the President. The question is, what's wrong in an ordinary citizen … … wanting to meet the President of his country? Or is it just wrong for a Muslim man to even try? And as Rizvan Khan continues to be treated as guilty … … until proven innocent, for PBC News, my name is Bobby Ahuja. And I'm not a terrorist. He is right. Zakir Bhai is right. We are told to report to the government any information … … we have on any terrorist activity. And when we do that, what happens is before you. Why is this being asked over and over again? "Why does Khan want to meet the President?" What's the harm if an ordinary citizen wants to meet the President? What's wrong? Or then tell us clearly that Muslims don't have right to do so. Yes, good afternoon. This is Tracy Brennan … … Chairperson of the American Autistic society in San Francisco. Would you put me on to your officer in-charge of the … … Rizvan Khan case, please? This is about the Rizvan Khan case. Any information you have on Rizvan Khan. Look I've been calling all morning. I need to know where Rizvan Khan has been taken, please. Hello, hello. My name is Rizvan Khan. Khan, from the epiglottis. I want to report a man. I have to report a man. I met him at a downtown mosque. His name is Dr. Faisal Rehman. Faisal Rehman, he works at the St. Benedicts Hospital. He is a bad man. He is a very bad man. Your call helped them arrest Dr. Rehman. Eight others were arrested with him. It's a big catch, Rizvan. You are free to go now. You are free. Hey, watch it. Finally, Rizvan Khan's innocence has been proved. He will be freed in a few moments. A small, but increasing group of supporters … … have gathered here today … … and have shown no signs of leaving. Bano, come quickly! Rizvan Khan has been released. He's been freed. Bare Essentials Mystique, Mandira's perfume … 35 dollars, 99 cents. On sale now, at Walmart. Hey, you famous or something? On sale now at Walmart. - You some Guru or something? Some crazy lady was just here shouting about your … … innocence and what not. - Crazy lady. Mandira. Mandira was here. Crazy lady, Mandira was here. Where did she go? Where did she go? Where did she go? - She went out the back way. Mandira. Mandira. Mandira. Sorry Mandira, I couldn't meet you … … since I haven't fulfilled my promise to you yet. But somehow Mandira, as soon as I saw you … … the pain in my chest vanished. Where did Rizvan Khan go? And why does he want to meet the President? No one knows. So why he wants to meet the President … … and what is his message about continues to remain a mystery. This is Bobby Ahuja, PBC news. - Yeah, so … Thank you so much for this internship, sir. We promise not to let you … Thank me later … First find this Khan … His story has moved thousands of Muslims. I wish I knew where Bhai was, Raj. He calls me. Yeah. Yeah, next time he calls me I'll let you know. Yo, Paki loser. Hey! My name is Abdul! You want a piece of me. You show me the finger? - Enough, okay buddy. Come, I'll show you once and for all. - I'm done. Come I'll show you! What you looking at? For a while now I have been fighting with myself. I teach you about identity when my own has been changed so drastically. My hijab is not just my religious identity. It is a part of my existence. Khan stayed in room 22 only. You want to stay in the same room? Only 25 dollars extra, to be a part of history. And mind you, my name is Jitesh. And I'm not a terrorist. Mummy, I want to tell you something today. Today I'm proud to be a computer hacker. Ya … I have eaten already. At least listen to what I'm saying first. Hurricane Molly … now moving at 125 miles per hour … … has severely hit the southern coast. And the authorities around the southern region have been alerted. We now go live to Alex, who's on location. Thank you, Janice. Attention all passengers … … E-52 bus to Portland has been delayed by 10 minutes. Again, E-52 Portland bus has a ten minute delay. We regret the inconvenience. We have a fresh update, this just in. We've news that the hurricane has hit Wilhemina, Georgia. I repeat, Wilhemina, Georgia has been hit. Full on by hurricane Molly. At this point we don't have any indication as to … Mama Jenny … Mama Jenny I have to go to her. Raj … Bhai called … You wanted to know where he was, didn't you? Yes, Zakir bhai? He's going to Wilhemina. Wilhemina? That's in Georgia, right? Ya … Somewhere there. What is he doing there? He said that he has to meet some Mama Jenny there. Mandira, there's going to be a delay in meeting the President. I have come to Wilhemina, Georgia. Mama Jenny and Funny hair Joel are in trouble. There's too much water here, Mandira … … and I don't think Mama Jenny can swim. She's a little fat. Rizvan. Mama Rizvan. Rizvan. What are you doing here? Mama Jenny, I'm happy, Funny hair Joel and you are not dead. I'm happy. Thank you for coming, Rizvan. But you should not be here. - I'm happy, I'm here. No, you must go. No, you must go. - No, no, no. Listen to me. - No, no, no. You should not be here. This one you cannot repair. Now go. Mama, Rizvan. Oh, God the church is going to fall. We're going to die. The church is going to fall. Hadith says that the Almighty does not judge by colour or creed … … but by actions and deeds. If that is the truth … … then Rizvan Khan by the sheer force of his actions … … has elevated the entire humanity in the eyes of God. Just recently this man was arrested … … and tortured for being an enemy combatant of this country. Wonder what the government officials would call this … … Muslim enemy combatant today? As he selflessly tries to save the remaining lives in Wilhemina. Just a few days ago this man was called a terrorist … … and tortured mercilessly. Today we wait for the response of the government officials … … as he tirelessly strives to save innocent lives. If the authorities want to find the true enemy … … combatant of this country. Then they would find it in the grief and debris of Wilhemina. It's a long journey to change the world. But the first few steps have been taken by Rizvan Khan in Wilhemina. Isn't it our duty now to take this journey forward? Raj Burman, Star News. Please don't take my baby away from me. Mandira, people are suffering here and are very helpless. I wish I could take all of them from here. But I don't have the physical strength to do that. Mama Jenny is right … This one … this one I can't repair. Now we can only await the Lord's merciful eye. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! While several hurricane hit areas … … have suffered from government inaction. One small town in Georgia is slowly getting back on its feet. This group has brought something more valuable than money. They brought themselves. The US government may have forgotten the flood … … inflicted area of Wilhemina, Georgia … … but one man has refused to be indifferent … … to the plight of its inhabitants. This one man has spared no efforts in helping … … rehabilitate the population of Wilhemina. Looking at him as an inspiration today … … many Americans have rushed to Wilhemina … … and its neighbouring towns to help in rebuilding the destroyed towns. And all this just because of one man … … whose name is Rizvan Khan … … and who, in his own words, is not a 'terrorist'… Following the example of Wilhemina … … towns are being adopted across the country. And while our military is tied up in Iraq … … reconstruction of these towns … … has been taken on by ordinary Americans. And today, as our special guest from Wilhemina … … we have the man, who got the whole ball rolling. Mr. Rizvan Khan. Oh no, no, no it's Khan. - Excuse me. Khan. - Excuse me. Khan. - One minute. From the epiglottis, ma'am. Khan. I'm sorry, Rizvan. Maybe you could tell us why you want to meet the president? Senator, you need to take a look at these campaign accounts. - Later. I want to watch this. My beautiful wife, Mandira. She … she told me to go and meet the President of America. A long tiring journey, Rizvan. What kept you going? My son's soccer shoes. My son Sam, and his best friend Reese, they they love playing soccer. I'm sorry Mrs. Khan, I didn't know what to do. And I was scared. And they threatened hurt me. And I'm sorry. I'm just really, really sorry. I'm sorry Mrs … - Sorry is not good enough. That's just not good enough. Thank you for asking for leniency for me. I didn't do it for you, I did it for your mom. My mom won't forgive me. She will. She's a mom. Mandira, this is Sarah. Thanks. Thank you for Reese. And I hope and pray that Sam's soul rests in peace. Mandira, we both know what it feels like to lose people we love. I lost my husband to hate. Don't lose Rizvan. Let go of your anger, just let go. I love you son. Zakir, Hasina. I'm leaving now … Bye, bye. Bhai why do you have to leave so late at night? I've to go now. It is three days to the Presidential election. After that the President will change. I have to meet him before that. Now, I need to meet him now. Now, now. Leave me! You got Dr. Rehman arrested! You are an infidel! This is your punishment, Khan! This is your punishment! You have to die! Islam will never forgive you! Leave me! Oh Lord!! The United States of America has a new President. Doctor, he just got up. Let me check all his vitals, lets go. There are only two kinds of people in this world. He died because of you. Because of your surname! Leave me alone. Go right now! This instant! Go now, now. When should I come back, Mandira? I … I didn't die, Mandira. No, you didn't. Can I get a hug, please? Please. I love you. - I know. I love you too. Today the President elect visits flood inflicted Georgia State. The question is whether Rizvan Khan … … who has just been discharged from the hospital will get to meet him. Khan has refused to go back home until he meets the President elect. Raj Burman … Star News. Khan … let's go home. You don't need to do this now. No, no, no. Why? - No, no, no. I have to meet the President. Ammi had said, "A Khan always keeps his word!"

Rizvan Khan who has been in the news for all his efforts in Wilhemina … … is now at the Governor's mansion. He has been trying to meet the President for a while now. It's sad that he won't meet the President even today. Rizvan Khan's supporters are quite dejected at this prospect. However it looks like he'll face disappointment all over again. A disappointed group of Khan's supporters … … are getting ready to turn back. Copy that, Regal is on foot. Repeat that please. - Regal is on foot. Are you Rizvan Khan? - Yes, sir. Yes. - Yes, sir. The President wants to meet you. Greetings … Rizvan Khan, good to see you hale and hearty. You're on TV more than me now. Mandira. He knows my name. You already know my name. - Yes, I do.
