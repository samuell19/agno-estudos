Hey, Trudy! I thought that might be you. I didn't know you drove a NetCar. I do. Hop in. So where are we headed tonight? I'm headed to Tatnuck Square. Corner of Pleasant and Copperfield. You know, I don't normally splurge on a black car, but this is really nice. So, working late? Yeah, this Criminology class is kicking my butt. Look, I can help you if you want. Charles! Okay, don't get all defensive, it's just an offer. Do you feel safe? How so? You know, letting strange people into your car. I mean, you're bound to get some crazies. You know, my mother always told me, don't pick up hitchhikers or get into strangers cars. Well, I know more about you than you think. Trudy O'Donnell, four point seven stars. What? Someone didn't give me a "five". Clearly. You ticked them off pretty bad if they only gave you a "four". Ah, clearly. No, I feel safe enough, though. Plus, I don't have to deal with any cash. Mmm. That's true. You know what, Charles, just go a little further up. Um, I'm on the right, 92. See you later. Thanks, Charles. You are so welcome. Hey, I'll see you in class, okay? - Yes, you will. - All right. Hey, Trudy... you just earned yourself five stars.

A little before 2:00. Did I wake you? No, I had to pee. You look exhausted. I'm fine. You're not fine! You've got bags under your eyes. You're too skinny and you haven't showered in three days. Two! Three! I'm counting. Yeah, well, I'm busy. Oh, that's bull! You're hiding. Hiding from what? Real life. Yeah, real life starts next year. Oh, what? When you work 90 hours a week as a lackey in some high-powered law firm? Yeah, well, it's what I want. Yoow what? We're going to go out. - Gretch... - No, shh! Stop. We're going out. You need it. Yeah, like a hole in the head. I am so sick of seeing you moping around, trying not to think of that damn ex of yours. We're going out. We're not going out! The classical theory of criminal justice revolves around the idea that a person who breaks the law does so with rational free will and that society therefore should design a punishment of equal severity to the crime. Miss O'Donnell. But a pre-requisite for the classical philosophy is that all humans are hedonists. That we prefer pleasure over pain and are therefore deterred from committing crimes by the threat of uncomfortable circumstances. I'm not sure I buy that. So you are more of a positivist then? Well, yes. Like Comte, I think that our criminal justice system should work to improve society, not cater to its most base instinct. The problem is, is that our penal system is absolutely classical in its theory and design. Okay, is it really classical by design? Or is that just in practice? The forces that push people into criminal behavior, whether it's social or psychological, I mean, even biological, those are the same forces that push our penal system back to that classical way of thinking. That is a frightening thought. So you're saying that people would rather retaliate than rehabilitate? Absolutely. I mean, it is human nature, right? Eye for an eye? Hammurabi. Society tries, but they can't seem to reign in that innate aggression. Hence the debate behind the western philosophy of legalism. Thank you both so very much, we're out of time for today. Bring it back here next time when we discuss the vital importance of an uncontaminated crime scene in the forensic examination of trace evidence. Don't come in here if you don't do the reading. Hey, you know, I think where the classical theory breaks down is with the assumption that the criminal mind is rational. I mean, it's not. Do you want to grab a coffee and discuss it? Nice try. What? Did I say something wrong? I'm not interested, Charles. I told you a million times. Thanks again for the ride. It's just coffee. There are so many things I should be doing. Hey, you know what? For someone who looks as hot as you do right now, you complain a lot. Okay, I need you to do me a favor. Change your attitude, and have fun with me tonight, please? Come on. Hi, Steve! Good to see you. - Come on. Thank you. - Thanks. I did not need that last Fireball shot. That wasn't the last one. We're about to get another round for those guys. Oh, no, no, no, no. I am going home. You're such a lightweight. The night's just getting started. Really? Okay. I'm having fun, I am. But I have so much to do tomorrow, and I just need to go home before it gets ugly. Oh, come on, that guy is so cute. Ugh, I know, that's why I need to leave. Okay, honestly, I'm not ready to go yet. Just stay then. I'll take a NetCar. - One more shot. - Gretch. - Okay, I love you. - Bye.

Hello? - 911 dispatch, how may I help you? I... I think I've been raped. Okay, Trudy. Now I need to do a speculum exam, which mean I need to do an internal vaginal and anal swab. Would you like me to continue? Yes. This is an emergency contraceptive and a clinic where you can have an HIV test. Thanks. That rape kit exam is not easy, but it is crucial in gathering the evidence we need to find, try and convict this guy. When will we get the results? That can take several weeks. Several weeks? Trudy, this is a long and difficult process. But you've taken the hardest step in reporting your assault. Now you just need to be patient and let us do our job. In the meantime, what can you tell me about what happened? That's the thing, I don't remember. It's like it was all just erased. Sounds like Rohypnol. A roofie? Were you drinking last night? Yes. It's really easy to slip into a drink. Plus, combined with alcohol, it can cause memory impairment. The tox screen will confirm the results, but for now it's a good bet that it's Rohypnol. Who had access to your drinks last night? I don't know, the bartender... Uh, the guys we were dancing with, they bought us shots. Trud. - Gretchen. - My gosh! I was so worried about you. Are you okay? No. Here, let's get you home. I've brought you clothes. We can continue this later. - Go home. - Thank you. That's the thing... I don't remember. I remember getting into the NetCar... and then waking up in a motel room naked. I shouldn't have made you come out. And I shouldn't have let you leave alone. I'm just glad you're okay. -I mean, those two guys, I thought... -What? What? No, those two guys were harmless. Who was your driver? I never thought about that. I got a "no show". What does that mean? It means my car showed up and I wasn't there. - Then who drove you? - Exactly. God, I'm such an idiot. I mean, I just hopped into a black car and assumed it was my ride. Trud, it was an honest mistake. Okay? I would've done the same thing. - It's not your fault. - No. It's my fault. - Hi, I'm Detective Jackson. - Hi. Westchester PD. Were you on duty the night of May 14th. Uh, yeah. Are you aware that a rape occurred in room 106. Yeah, my boss had told me about it. I understand that the man who rented that room paid in cash. Yeah, if that's what it says in the ledger, then yeah, I suppose. And you didn't ask him for ID? Or have him fill out an information card? Hey, lady, look, most of the people that stay here, they like to stay anonymous, you know what I mean? So it's your policy not to ask for ID? If they pay in cash. Did you see what he was driving? Black town car, maybe? Something boxy, dark. License plate? You serious? I'm going to need to see your security camera footage from that night. Good luck with that. Do you think this is funny? It's $9.99 online. Put a double A battery right in there, and it makes that little red light go. Looks pretty convincing, huh? It fooled you, detective, so... All right, so what can you tell me about this guy? Pretty average. 5'10" or so. A little heavy set. How was he dressed? Not bad. Pretty sharp for somebody that would stay here at least. Would you be willing to work with one of our sketch artists? Yeah, yeah, I mean... If you want to talk to my boss, sort it out, so... Okay, thank you for your time. - Yeah, sure. - I'll be in touch. Look forward to it. Hey. Not going to class today? No, I don't feel up for it. Uh, do you want me to stay with you today? - No. - You sure? Yeah. All right, well... get outside. Get some exercise or something. I will. - Seriously. - I will. It sounds like a good idea. Hey. You're gonna be okay. Am I? Of course, you are. You are a strong, angry woman who can make a difference. Yeah, but how? Well... that's something you're gonna have to figure out. - Bye. - Bye. - Love you. - Love you, too. Hello. Mom. Sweetie? What's wrong? Trudy, come in. I was just about to call you. The results of your tox screen have come back. And? You tested positive for the drug Flunitrazepam. Rohypnol, as we suspected. What about the rest of my rape kit? Well, none of the forensic diagnostics have been done yet. Unfortunately, there's a backlog of these. But the lab technician did tell me that there was vaginal swelling consistent with intercourse, and that she was able to identify a small piece of latex and a semen sample. Great. So he raped me and the condom broke. Yes, but that does give us an advantage. He doesn't necessarily know this and now we have a DNA sample. I mean, did you learn anything else? Anything at the motel? Did anyone at the club see anything? No. Unfortunately not. He knew what he was doing, and he covered his tracks pretty well. Did this case fit any other MO? Any other case that you might be looking into? We cross-referenced his methods, the car, the motel, but until we get forensic evidence back from the lab, it's just too early to tell. Just out of curiosity, how many of these cases do you actually solve? I don't know, it's hard to say. Educated guess? 20 to 30 percent. I actually looked into it. And nationally, only 32% of all rape cases are reported. That sounds about right. 7% of those lead to an arrest and only 2% are convicted. Yes. That means that 98% of all rapists are walking the streets free. Not very good odds. No. I'm afraid not. Hi, Charles. Trudy, hi! Did you change your mind about that coffee? I want to learn to drive a NetCar. Hey. Wait, so you know how the app works? Yeah. You get an alert when you're in the vicinity of a fare. Seriously, pay attention to that star rating. You do not have to pick up anybody that you are not comfortable with, okay? - Okay. - Okay. You upgraded your insurance? Yes. Do you have a case of water in the trunk? - I get it, I get it. - You got it? You got it? Okay. Really, you're gonna be awesome, okay? Call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Charles, I really appreciate it. You're welcome. You know, you never did exactly tell me, why're you doing this anyway? A little extra cash, just like you. Huh. Something more to it though, isn't there? Yeah, okay. I got it. Listen, good luck. You're gonna be great, okay? Charles. I can't believe you told him you were from Sweden. What? Wasn't I convincing? No, not even close. Okay, we're going to 14 Schuster Road. "Vit Logn" is a little white lie. I tell you a little vit logn. You are the most handsome man I see today. And he goes, "really?" Classic. You girls go to Becker? Yeah, one more year. Nice. I got my undergrad there. Really? And now you're driving NetCar? It's really encouraging. Sorry, just kidding. You know, you don't know anything about me. Sorry, I was just kidding. I didn't mean anything by it. Like, seriously, you don't know anything about me and you just hopped right into my car and gave me your home address. You should be more careful. I saw you arriving on my phone. Driver Trudy, grey Corolla. - What? That's not you? - No, that's me. But people aren't always who they say they are. Whatever. - Hi. - Hi. So how long have you been using the NetCar service for? Oh, couple of years now. Couple of years and you still have five stars, that's impressive. Well, let me tell you, a little courtesy goes a long way. Oh, isn't that the truth. God, I just snapped at a customer... cost me about half a star. Yikes! Eh, what happened? It... It doesn't matter. Just having a tough couple of weeks. Worst chapter of my life, really. Oh, well, I'm not having a great week either. My girlfriend broke up with me. I'm sorry. That's all right. It's not your fault. I should've seen it coming. Let me ask you this, when a woman says, "it's not you, it's me." Like, should I believe that? - Honestly? - Yeah. No, she's just softening the blow. Well, thank you for the ego boost. I mean, it maybe her feelings that have changed, but, I mean, it's you she fell in love with. Are you okay? - Hmm? - You okay? Oh! Oh, yeah. Yeah. Better to face these things head on, huh? - That's what I always say. - That's right. -Still... Still stings though. Yeah. This looks good right here. That's great. Okay. Uh... look, I'm sorry for emotionally unloading on you like that. No problem. You know, if I ever need another ride, is there a way that I could just request you? Uh, well, you have my work phone number in your cell. So if I'm available I'd be happy to pick you up. Well... that's not what I meant. What did you mean? I meant I want to call you. You know? Call you-call you. I don't think that's a good idea. No, you're right, that's stupid. Sorry. Well, you have a good night, all right? - You, too. - Okay. Any experienced crime scene officer is going to tell you, that the most important thing they can do to ensure that any evidence that they find stands up in court... is to control and secure that crime scene. So we're talking about a large perimeter. We're talking about essential personnel only. What about the victim? Victims get attended to. Attended to? Dr. Bell... every TV crime drama I've ever seen is hammered home the idea of a clean crime scene, but shouldn't the rights of the victim and her well-being come first? No. Not at the expense of evidence that's going to convict a perpetrator. Really? So... a rape victim for example, who is just been violated and assaulted, and can't shower has to sit through five hours of a de-humanizing rape kit examination before anybody asks her if she's okay. I think the majority of our crime scene officers and our law enforcement personnel are more compassionate than that, Miss O'Donnell. Which way did he come from? That way. I mean, he was waiting for someone like you. He might've already been watching. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was parked right there. Perfect view to the entrance of the club. I mean, he was just waiting for a single girl to come out who looked like she was going to get a NetCar. I was a sitting duck. - Hi. - Hi. Uh... Do you mind if we take a look at room 106? I'm not really supposed to just to let you into a room. You know what? It's fine. It's fine. You just make sure that nobody's in there. Nope. You, uh... You don't mind if I ask you what this is all about, do you? Did you work the night of May 14th? Uh, yeah, I did as a matter of fact. But, the cops already came and I told them everything I know. So... Yeah, I was the girl. Oh. That's messed up. I'm sorry. Is this you? Mark? Uh, no, no. Mark's the manager here. I'm Roger. Oh, um... Give me the pen. Roger what? Uh, Roger Dennison. Great. Okay. Oh, sorry, it's... - It's the silver one. - I'll bring it right back. Take your time. Gosh, this place is a dump. What do you remember? I woke up right here. It just doesn't make sense. I mean, it's his face... It's bizarre. It's okay. It's okay, don't force it. I put up a fight. I remember that. Is this helping? Yes. I want to get inside his head. Find the flaws in the system. I've been thinking about it 24/7 anyway. Might as well feel like I'm actively answering questions. And the cops still have nothing? Nope. All right. Well, don't work too late. - I won't. - All right. Um... before I forget. What is this? It's pepper spray. If I could buy you a gun, I would, but... just in case. Be careful. Hey, Gretch. Thanks for everything. Detective Jackson. Uh, it's, uh... It's Trudy O'Donnell. I thought about something. He knows where I live. Okay, it's all right. How does he know your address? I told him. When I got in the car, I told him my address. I'm usually so careful to just give them the cross streets. Has he been there? Have you noticed anything suspicious? No. I can't believe I gave him my address. Trudy, the crime he committed against you was not personal. It was violent and intimate, but not personal. Nothing you did caused the attack. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Do they ever go after the same person twice? I can't say that it never happens, but it is rare. These kind of crimes are opportunistic. It's not your fault. Do you understand me? No, I don't. Bye. Hey, you look like you could use one. - Hey, Charles. - Hey. Yeah, I could actually use a coffee. Is there cream in it? Cream and one equal. Just how you like it. Thank you. How do you know that? I pay attention. So... how is the NetCar driving going? You never warned me that I'd have to become a therapist. People do tell you their problems, don't they? Oh, my God, do they ever? Vanderbilt rape case? Yeah, what do you know about it? Well, they were idiots. I mean, not that it's any less atrocious, but they didn't go out that night planning to rape that girl. Circumstances just took a dark turn when they brought her back to the dorm passed out. Do you know the prosecutors knew that because the boys kissed her? Really? Yeah. Like she was their girlfriend. And like, she might be turned on. Like, there might be consent. But of course, there wasn't. She was unconscious. Charles... what does a kiss mean to you? I mean, do you want me to show you? Charles! Okay, all right. Sorry. But a kiss can be even more intimate than intercourse. Yeah. Hey, baby, how are we doing tonight? Where are you headed? Oh, oh, oh, why so cold? What's a smoke show like you doing working for NetCar? I'm not your baby. Oh, I don't know about that. I do know you're smoking hot. I'd do you in a heartbeat. Get out. Get out. Get out of my car. - Get out of my car. - Hey! There ain't no point in making a scene. He was just messing with you. He didn't mean nothing by it. Come on, can we just all get back in and go where we need to go? No! Get out of my goddamn car. Oh, hey, look. I'm sorry about what I said. It was wrong. It won't happen again. Listen, it's not worth a bad customer rating. Hmm? Really. I'm sorry. Come on, Trudy, me and my boy Carlos here, we're not looking for any trouble. We just want to go out and have a little fun. Yeah? Where are you going? Ah, what's that strip club down on Southbridge Street. Sweaty Betty's. Typhoon Betty's, really? Oh, yeah! No doubt. You know it? Come on, I'll be good, I promise. No hard feelings. Okay. One more crack and you're out. I like your fight, girl. Yeah, get in the car. Hey, Carlos' sister, she's a dancer down at Sweaty Betty's. We just going to keep an eye on her. No, seriously, yeah? Carlos and me, we get all the tail we want. We don't need to go hang out at no strip bar. All right. Okay, yeah, I know. "Watch my language." I'll shut up! You know, it's not about the language. It's about respecting women. Oh, I respect Carlos' sister. Yeah. Oh, she is a dime piece. Oh, yeah. See? That. That right there. You immediately sexually objectified her. No, I respect her beauty. Oh! Do you? Or do you just want to have sex with her? Well... Maybe. But, you know, she's Carlos' sister. He'd probably like, straight up kill me, right, Carlos? No doubt. Hey, so... what's the deal? You don't like guys or something? Are you a lesbian? Okay, just stop talking, okay? And I will get you to Sweaty Betty's. Fine. Whatever. Hey, I don't know if you believe me, but no means no with me. I take that stuff really serious. It's Manuel. Uh, hey, Trudy. Change of plans, pull over here. Stay in the car! End our ride. But you're not getting out. Please, I freaking respect you. Now just do what I told you and end our ride. No! Not if you're not getting out of the car. Oh, my! Oh, my God. Okay. There! I ended it. What do you want? I don't have any cash. Give me five stars. There! Okay, fine. I gave you five stars. Now turn off your phone. You're going on break. God, please don't hurt me. There, it's off. Good. Turn around. U-Turn. We're going to get Manuel. Okay, look... Look, I'll cooperate, but you're making me really nervous with that gun in my face, okay? Can you please put it away? Yeah. Sorry. But if you try anything it comes right back out. Understand? Okay. Okay. Okay, fine. Thank you. Where are you taking me? It doesn't matter. Take a right up ahead. Ay, ay, ay! There he is. You guys! Is he... Is he okay? Guys, we need to take him to a hospital! Shut the hell up! We gotta get him to Doc Espinoza. No, no, no. He needs an ambulance. No ambulance! - Get in the car. - No! - Get in the car. - No! - Mira. - Okay. Let's go. It's okay. It's okay. Memorial Hospital. It's the closest. No, no, I told you, no hospitals. We have to get him to the doc. He needs a hospital. Listen, the hospital will call the cops. Now go to Winter and Harding, behind the metal shop. Carlos, check his pockets. He got anything on? - You got anything? - Nothing. Ah, Manuel, I told you to keep it simple. Why'd you have to go mess up like this? Now you're shot! Yeah, I know, it hurts. I know. It's okay. I'm gonna get you to the doctor. Don't you... Don't you think about dying on me. Don't you die! Don't you die! What are you looking at? Drive! It's okay. Hey! You're not going to tell anybody about this, right? - No. - Okay. Seriously, don't tell the cops. -You know, you're good, right? -Mmm-hmm. We didn't hurt you or nothing. Okay? Good. I owe you one. Trud, what do you mean, a drug dealer got shotshotd bled all over your back seat? Trud, why didn't you wake me up? - Did you call the police? - No. Okay, one had a gun and made me promise not to tell the police. He threatened you with a gun? Trud! Stop! Talk to me. I was so scared. I never had a gun pointed at me before. Let's go inside, okay? Have you had anything you eat? No? I'll make breakfast, all right? -Okay. -Let's go inside. We'll worry about this later. I didn't sleep at all last night. I bet. Look, I really don't want to tell the police. Why not? I just don't. Trud, he had a gun to your head. I honestly don't think Juan was going to hurt me. He and I kind of bonded. You bonded with a gang banger? They could've killed you. Those guys are criminals. They need to be put behind bars. They're only trying to survive the only way they know how. I mean, do you really want to clog the courts with a couple of dope dealers when there are serial rapists out there? - Howdy, stranger! - Hey, hey! -Trudy! -How'd you know I was in the neighborhood? I didn't. I didn't. I guess it's my lucky day. Get in. So? What's going on this evening? Just meeting some clients for some drinks. I got an idea. Why don't you join me? - With your clients? - Yeah. Well, they're clients, but they're friends of mine. It actually sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I could. Come on. What time's your shift end? Late. What do you do, by the way? We kind of skipped over this small talk last time. Investment management. Super dull. But, pays the bills. I imagine it pays 'em quite adequately. Yeah, I suppose it does. Look, why don't you call whoever you have to call and just tell 'em you're clocking out. You don't want to bring your NetCar driver to have drinks with your clients. Oh, but I do. I do. Oh, wait, hold on. Is that a smile? That's a smile. Yeah. Maybe you're finally turning the page on the worst chapter of your life. I actually just got held up at gunpoint to go pick up a drug dealing gun-shot victim in an alley. Come on. Are you kidding? New chapter. - Better. - Yeah. I'm sorry. The last thing you need right now is an overly emotional woman breaking down on you. Mmm. Yeah. Kidding. I'm kidding. Listen, no, there's no where else I'd rather be than right here with you right now. Yeah, what about your clients? They can wait. Do you want to talk about it? No! No. I don't want to trouble you with my problems, okay? You don't even know me. Well, honestly, I'd like to get to know you. - Are you flirting with me? - Yes. Hard. Sorry. Was that inappropriately honest? Yes. Should I have denied that I was flirting with you? No. Okay. Well, yeah. Honesty is one of my faults. I'm not sorry. You shouldn't be. It's refreshing. It's not really the best circumstance for flirting. Well, that's not really your call to make now, is it? I'm damaged goods. We're all damaged goods. Why didn't you go out for drinks with him? He is just some guy I met in my NetCar. No. That is not the way I want to meet somebody. He's smart. Attractive. He has money. I mean, what more do you want? I don't know. I broke down. I mean... I cried like a baby and I don't even know him. I guess I just want a little more romance. Ugh, I hate feeling desperate. That is so romantic! Are you kidding me? Look, he stumbled into my life twice. If it's meant to be... he'll stumble in again. That's a positive way of thinking. Gretchen. Gretch! Holy crap! Is that him? Here. Write this down. -Ready? Mass plate... Are you ready? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. Go. 1-4-8-N-K-3. N-K-3. Got it. I mean, should we call the cops? Not, yet. He hasn't done anything. I mean it might be a legit NetCar. I mean, what do you want to do? You just want to sit here and wait to see if he maybe rapes someone? Well, hopefully we can call the cops before something happens, but yes, okay, we need to find something incriminating. -Gretch! Gretch! Gretch! Wake up! Wake up! -Oh, my gosh, what? Look, look, look. She just requested a NetCar. How do you know? Do you think he's monitoring the NetCar system, too? I imagine it's possible. Oh, my gosh, look, he's pulling up. He's not a NetCar. He's not on the GPS. What do you want to do? We're gonna follow him. - Oh, my gosh. - Put your seatbelt on. Don't you think we should call the cops? Trudy? Well, now you have something to report. Oh, my God. What? It's him. - Who? - Donovan. Donovan? Jackson. - Trudy... - I... Trudy, are you there? Give it. Hi. Hi, I'm Trudy's roommate. Look, we're at the Slumber Haven Motel. He's here. He's got another girl with him. Wait, slow down. What is your name? My name is Gretchen Healy. I am Trudy's roommate. Is Trudy there with you? - Yeah. - Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. I'm fine. We're in the car. We followed him here. Okay, do not go in there. Stay away from the motel. I'll send a unit right over. Okay. Okay. Thank you. - They're on their way. - He was in my car. He was in my car! He gave me coffee. He had to know it was me. Maybe he didn't. God, I'm so stupid. Oh, God! - I thought I liked him. - Hey, hey, hey. You were smart, okay? You followed your instinct. You didn't have drinks with him. But I wanted to! Do not do this to yourself. God! What is he... Hold on. God, she's wasted. Let me see. Let me see. I need to help her. - The cops are on their way. - We gotta get her out of there. Detective Jackson said to wait in the car. No, I don't care. Okay? Uh, just a second. Hang on! Police. Open up please. Hey, sorry, I was just in the shower. - Are you alone? - Yeah. -Why? -We're investigating a possible kidnapping. We got a report of suspicious activity here at the motel. -Mmm. -Mind if we take a look around? I'm pretty sure you need a warrant, but no, you know, help yourself. Go ahead. You, uh... notice anything out of the ordinary? Mmm. Like what? Loud guests. Screaming, arguing? No. It's been a pretty quiet night actually. All right. Thank you for your time. - Of course. - Good night. Night. You two put yourselves into a very dangerous situation tonight. I sat with him right here in this diner. He has ridden in my car. But can you positively identify him from the night of your assault. God dammit, no! Do you recognize this man? No. It's an artist's sketch based on the motel clerk's description of your assailant. -That doesn't make any sense. He wasn't... -This... is our best lead right now. Where was the girl? Trudy, you know the law. There was absolutely nothing wrong in that motel room tonight. Nothing suspicious. No victim. No arrest. We saw him take her in there. But you can't identify him. And the man in that motel room doesn't even remotely resemble this drawing. I need you two to back off and let us do our police work. You have no idea what I've been through. I can't just sit around and wait. Unfortunately... I do know what you've been through. I've been through it myself. This is a victim's advocate. She works with social services and I think she could be a big help to you right now. She'll help you navigate this system and give you some place to vent your frustrations. In the meantime, you need to go home. Let me do my job. We're gonna get his guy. We're not going home. What is he still doing in there? Probably sleeping. Trud, it's 4:00 in the morning. He's not our guy. Can we please just go? No. He's not sleeping. Then what is he doing? - She's not even in there. - Yeah, where did she go? She has to be. We saw him bring her in there. I don't know. Maybe he got... adjoining rooms or something. Look. Duck. Duck. Duck. - Put your seatbelt on. - Oh, my gosh. What's happening? Just duck. What are you doing? I'm so confused. I'll come talk to her later. Let's let her sleep it off. - What are you doing here? - Hi. My name is Trudy O'Donnell. I'm not selling anything. I think we had similar experiences. What are you talking about? A couple of weeks ago I got into a black NetCar and I was raped by my driver. Do you remember how you got home last night? Um... What? What? I think you better go away. - No, no, no. Please, just... - Go or I'll call the police. Let me talk, please. Please? Okay? I just want to help. I know who the man was, and I don't think he assaulted you. Well, how did you find me? I followed you home from the motel. What motel? How much do you... know about what happened... last night? Um... Okay, just... Let me get dressed. Okay. Do you feel like you've been... sexually assaulted? I mean, do you feel like you've had sex? No. I don't think so. I think I would know. Good. Good. That's what I thought. He's too smart to go through with it. Oh, my God. - What the hell happened? - It's not your fault. He's not a NetCar driver. He just pulls up in a nice black car and we unsuspectingly get in. And he raped you? Yes. Oh, my God. I have to go to the police. Would you? I was hoping you'd say that. This could really help my case. Yeah. Of course. I'm so sorry. Donovan. Thank you for coming in. Am I under arrest? No. I just wanted to talk to you about what happened at the motel the other night. Okay, well, then you're aware that I'm here completely at my own prerogative. And I can leave at any time. I'm not accusing you of anything. I just wanted to tell you what we know and see if maybe you could fill in a few holes for us. We have a witness that saw you pickup Elise Steele in front of the Paladium last Friday night. Did you know Miss Steele before she got into your vehicle? We also know that she had Rohypnol in her system the following day. That same witness... saw you drop Miss Steele off in front of her home just a few hours later. Please... I'm just asking for a little cooperation here. Listen, detective... I know my rights. I know how this works. I don't mean to be obstinate... but I'd prefer to share any information I do or do not know in a court of law. If and when that should occur. Oh, oh! And by the way... your officer who didn't have a warrant did a completely illegal search of my premises... and I'll press charges if I need to. Okay then. I'm going to leave now. Oh, and thank you for your service to our community, detective. Hi, Trudy. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. Oh! How do you know where I live? Let's not play games here with each other, Trudy. I know you followed me to the motel. - May I come in? - No. I don't want you to. Why would you follow me? I don't know what you're talking about. No, I think you do. You're afraid of me, aren't you? You should be. - I'll scream. - No, you won't. You know... I really thought that we had a connection. I felt it. Didn't you? You have nothing. Do you understand? Nothing. It's your word against mine. You don't have a shred of real evidence, so... unless you want to live your life in fear... how about you get off this little vigilante crusade of yours... and just go back to living your pretty little life. Stop. Stop. Go ahead! Scream. What the hell happened? - He was here. - Who? Donovan. He saw us at the motel. My God, did he hurt you? No. But I know it was him. Are you sure? You're not just wanting him to be the guy? No, I'm sure. It has to be. Okay, you need to call Detective Jackson. So she can tell me the same thing you just did? That I'm projecting my memories... that the witness' sketch doesn't even match his description. That damn motel clerk. Yeah, I did a little research on him. Several arrests. Did a little time for B&E and cocaine possession. Maybe he's working with Donovan. Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I have a plan. But I'm going to need your help. Only if you're willing. - Hello? - Okay, he's in place. Take a shot for courage. Okay. Love your guts. Love you more. Uh, can I have a shot of bourbon, please? Okay, we're on route. Remember the crime scene. Do not leave a trace. I have some water back there if you want. Thank you. You all right back there? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just sleepy. You know what they say... water's the best thing for you. Yeah. - How're you doing? - Good. - Can I get a room? - Yeah. 45 bucks for the night. I'll need you to fill in these out for me. Hey, where the hell is Green Street? It's, um, downtown. Canal district. Ah! Okay, yeah. How long does it take him to get here? This time of night, probably about 15 to 20 minutes. Okay. Thank you. - Car trouble. - Mmm-hmm. So we all good here or what? Yeah. Listen to me, this is the last goddamn time. Hey, mira. Here we go. So, Manuel's on his way, but it's going to take him like 20 minutes to get here. The guy inside, he says he's coming down Canal District way. Come on. Had too much to drink. Come on. I got a picture of you taking $200 from that douchebag. Now... I know what you did. So why don't you give me the master key and I won't tell the cops what I know. Whatever you want, bro. Hey. Why don't you go have a chat with your boy Roger? Carlos and me, we've got some work to do. Thanks, Juan. Hey, Trudy. I told you, I owe you one. Hello, Roger. I'm Trudy. Remember me? Why don't you tell me about that sketch? What the hell? Where did he go? Check the bathroom. Check the bathroom. It's locked. Whoa, whoa. What the hell? Hey, who are you? Drop it. Drop it. Just the wrong room, man. Just the wrong room. Call the police. Easy, man. Easy, easy. I checked. This is the wrong room. I know. But Roger, he told me to come down to 105. You know, that's it. That's all I was doing. - Shut up. - Hey, what's going on in there? Hey, is she okay? Yeah. She's fine. All right, looks like... Get off her! Hey, get off her. Get off her! Get up! - What took you so long? - I'm sorry. What took you so long? They're brothers. They're brothers. They're freaking brothers! Take off the mask! Take it off! Hi, Trudy. You're brothers? - Trudy... - How could you? Huh? I trusted you. God, I cared about you. You violated me! You breached me! I'm going to make sure that they put you away for a long, long time. But you know they won't. I'll see you in five years? Free on good behavior. I'll be waiting. Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You won't believe what they said. When they thought I was unconscious. Don't tell me. Don't. All I know is I got in the wrong car that night. Okay, well. We're going to stick to the plan. You have to get out of here. Okay. You have the pepper spray? Yeah. I guess it came in handy. Okay. I love your guts. I love you more. You got the DNA sample?
