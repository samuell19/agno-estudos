WHO DIDN'T DESERVE WHAT HE HAD, AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE HAD WAS THIS, UH, BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BRIDE. SARAH. WHEW. SHE WAS A GEORGIA PEACH.

OH, I DON'T KNOW IF I TOLD YOU, BUT HE WAS A FRENCHMAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE AN ENGLISHMAN. HMM? [Scoffs] [Grunts] YEAH, TOOK A LOT OF STRONG NYLON CORD TO GET HER AWAY FROM HIM, 'CAUSE SHE WAS A FIGHTER AS WELL AS BEIN' A GEORGIA PEACH. MMM. "MMM." MMM. I THINK THERE MUST'VE BEEN A-A LITTLE MIX-UP, UH... I TALKED TO YOUR SPONSOR OR TEACHER OR WHOEVER HE IS... AND I-I TOLD HIM THERE COULDN'T BE ANY PICTURES. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN ARTICLE, A STORY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? WELL, YEAH, IT'S FOR THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER, BUT IT HAS PICTURES. I MEAN, IT'S A REGULAR PAPER. WELL, KARL'S REAL SENSITIVE ABOUT HAVIN' HIS PICTURE MADE. HE WOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE BULLETIN BOARD FOR THE EASTER COLLAGE. NOW, A SHOVEL JUST MAKES TOO GODDAMN MUCH RACKET. MMM.

THIS'LL HELP, I BELIEVE. MMM. AND YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T STARE AT HIM. HOW AM I GOING TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW IF I CAN'T ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS? IT'S THE BEST IT'S GONNA GET. I'M SORRY. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? IF HE'S SO TROUBLED, WHY ARE YOU LETTING HIM OUT? WHAT IF HE DOES IT AGAIN? IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. HE'S FREE. HIS TIME'S UP. THAT'S THE RULES. HE'S BEEN TREATED AND REEVALUATED. HE DOESN'T SHOW ANY SIGNS ANYMORE. SIGNS? HOMICIDAL SIGNS. OH, UH, MISS, UM, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STEP OUTSIDE. WHY? PLEASE. I GOTTA CHANGE THE LIGHT IN HERE FOR KARL. I HOPE YOU CAN STILL SEE TO WRITE. I RECKON WHAT YOU IS WANTIN' TO KNOW IS WHAT I'M A-DOIN' IN HERE. I RECKON THE REASON I'M IN HERE IS 'CAUSE I'VE KILLED SOMEBODY, MM-HMM. BUT I RECKON WHAT YOU IS A-WANTIN' TO KNOW IS HOW COME I'D A-KILLED SOMEBODY, SO I RECKON I'LL START AT THE FRONT AND TELL YE, MMM. I LIVED OUT IN BACK OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER'S PLACE... MOST OF MY LIFE... IN A LITTLE OL' SHED THAT MY DADDY'D BUILT FER ME, MMM. THEY DIDN'T TOO MUCH WANT ME UP THERE IN THE HOUSE WITH THE REST OF 'EM, SO MOSTLY I JUST SET AROUND OUT THERE IN THE SHED A-LOOKIN' AT THE GROUND. I DIDN'T HAVE NO FLOOR OUT THERE, BUT I HAD ME A HOLE DUG OUT TO LAY DOWN IN, A QUILT OR TWO TO PUT DOWN THERE, MM-HMM. MY FATHER... WAS A HARDWORKIN' MAN MOST OF HIS LIFE, NOT THAT I CAN SAY THE SAME FOR MYSELF. I MOSTLY JUST SET AROUND OUT THERE IN THE SHED, TINKERED AROUND WITH A LAWN MOWER OR TWO, WENT TO SCHOOL OFF AND ON FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT THE CHILDREN OUT THERE, THEY... WERE VERY CRUEL TO ME AND... MADE QUITE A BIT OF SPORT OF ME, MADE FUN OF ME QUITE A BIT. SO MOSTLY I JUST SET AROUND OUT THERE IN THE SHED. MY DADDY... WORKED DOWN THERE AT THE SAWMILL, DOWN AT THE PLANER MILL, FOR AN OLD MAN NAMED DIXON. OLD MAN DIXON WAS A VERY CRUEL FELLER. DIDN'T TREAT HIS EMPLOYEES VERY WELL, DIDN'T PAY 'EM TOO MUCH OF A WAGE. DIDN'T PAY MY DADDY TOO MUCH OF A WAGE. JUST BARELY ENOUGH TO GET BY ON, I RECKON. I RECKON HE GOT BY ALL RIGHT. MMM. THEY USED TO COME OUT, ONE OR THE OTHER OF 'EM, USUALLY MY MOTHER, FEED ME PRETTY REGULAR, MM-HMM. SO I KNOW HE MADE ENOUGH TO WHERE I COULD HAVE MUSTARD AND BISCUITS... THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK, MMM. HMM. BUT OLD MAN DIXON, HE HAD A BOY, MMM, NAME OF JESSE DIXON. JESSE WAS REALLY MORE CRUEL THAN HIS DADDY WAS. HE USED TO MAKE QUITE A BIT OF SPORT OF ME... WHEN I WAS DOWN THERE AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE. USED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LITTLE GIRLS THERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL. MMM. THEY USED TO SAY... THAT MY MOTHER WAS A VERY PRETTY WOMAN. THEY SAID THAT QUITE A BIT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN I'D BE DOWN THERE AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE. WELL, I RECKON YOU WANT ME TO GET ON WITH IT AND TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED, SO I RECKON I'LL TELL YE. I WAS SITTIN' OUT THERE IN THE SHED ONE EVENING NOT DOIN' TOO MUCH OF NOTHIN', JUST STARIN AT THE WALL... AND WAITIN' ON MY MOTHER TO COME OUT AND GIVE ME MY BIBLE LESSON. MM-HMM. WELL, I HEARED A COMMOTION UP THERE IN THE HOUSE, MMM, SO I RUN UP ON THE SCREENED-IN PORCH TO SEE WHAT WAS GOIN' ON. I LOOKED IN THE WINDOW THERE AND I SEEN MY MOTHER LAYIN' ON THE FLOOR... WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON, MMM. MM-HMM. MMM. I SEEN JESSE DIXON A-LAYIN' ON TOP OF HER, MMM. HE WAS HAVIN' HIS WAY WITH HER. MMM. WELL, I JUST SEEN RED. MMM. I PICKED UP A KAISER BLADE THAT WAS SITTIN' THERE BY THE SCREEN DOOR. SOME FOLKS CALLED IT A SLING BLADE. I CALLED IT A KAISER BLADE. IT'S GOT IT A LONG, WOOD HANDLE, KINDA LIKE AN AX HANDLE... WITH A LONG BLADE ON IT SHAPED KINDA LIKE A BANANA, MM-HMM. SHARP ON ONE EDGE AND DULL ON THE OTHER'N, MMM. IT'S WHAT THE HIGHWAY BOYS USE TO CUT DOWN WEEDS AND WHATNOT. YEAH'M. WELL, I WENT IN THERE IN THE HOUSE... AND I HIT JESSE DIXON UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH IT, KNOCKED HIM OFF MY MOTHER, MMM. I RECKON THAT DIDN'T QUITE SATISFY ME, MMM, SO I HIT HIM AGAIN WITH IT IN THE NECK WITH THE SHARP EDGE... AND JUST PLUMB NEAR CUT HIS HEAD OFF, MMM, KILLED 'IM. MMM. MY MOTHER, SHE JUMPED UP FROM THERE AND STARTED HOLLERIN', "WHAT'D YOU KILL JESSE FER? WHAT'D YOU KILL JESSE FER?" WELL, MMM, COME TO FIND OUT, I DON'T RECKON MY MOTHER MINDED WHAT JESSE WAS A-DOIN' TO HER, MMM. I RECKON THAT MADE ME MADDER THAN WHAT JESSE'D MADE ME, SO I TAKENED THE KAISER BLADE... SOME FOLKS CALLED IT A SLING BLADE, I CALLED IT A KAISER BLADE, MMM... AND I HIT MY MOTHER UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH IT, MM-HMM. KILLED HER. SOME FOLKS HAS ASKED ME... IF YOU HAD IT TO DO OVER AGAIN, WOULD YOU DO IT THE SAME WAY? I RECKON I WOULD, MM-HMM. ANYHOW, THEY SEEN FIT TO PUT ME IN HERE, AND HERE I BEEN FOR A GREAT, LONG WHILE. I'VE LEARNED TO READ SOME. TOOK ME FOUR YEARS TO READ THE BIBLE. I RECKON I UNDERSTAND A GREAT DEAL OF IT. WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IN SOME PLACES. [Grunts] I'VE SLEPT IN A GOOD BED FOR A GREAT, LONG WHILE. NOW THEY'VE SEEN FIT TO PUT ME OUT OF HERE. THEY SAY THEY ARE SETTIN' ME FREE TODAY, MMM. ANYHOW, I RECKON THAT'S ALL YOU WAS NEEDIN' TO KNOW. YOU WANNA HEAR ABOUT MORE DETAILS, I RECKON I CAN TELL 'EM TO YE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOUR NEWSPAPER OR NOT, MM-HMM. [Marsha] WILL YOU EVER KILL ANYBODY AGAIN, KARL? MMM.

GO AHEAD. YOU THINK IT'S SAFE TO LET HIM AROUND THAT GUY? FRANK'S CRAZY 'BOUT HIM. HE LIKES THE WAY HE TALKS. HE HELPED HIM CARRY HOME THE CLEAN LAUNDRY. HE'S BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL A LONG TIME. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM. HE'S RETARDED'S ALL. HE'S ALWAYS AFTER A FATHER FIGURE. LORD KNOWS DOYLE AIN'T A GOOD ONE WITH HIS MEAN ASS. WHAT ABOUT ME? I DON'T THINK HE SEES YOU AS A "GUY" GUY. OH, KARL'S A "GUY" GUY? THIS IS WHAT I CALL MY SECRET PLACE, I USED TO COME HERE WITH KAREN CROSS. SHE'S KINDA LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND, OR USED TO BE. WE USED TO COME OUT HERE AND HOLD HANDS AND TALK... AND READ BOOKS TO EACH OTHER WITH A FLASHLIGHT. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH ME IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE... 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. WELL, MAMA AND ME, I MEAN. HER DADDY'S A DENTIST, SO THEY'RE RICH. WAS YOUR FOLKS WELL OFF? NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH. JUST BARELY ENOUGH TO SCRAPE BY ON, I RECKON. THEY STILL AROUND, YOUR FOLKS? MY MOTHER'S DEAD. MY DADDY'S S'POSED TO BE AROUND STILL, BUT HE DON'T WANNA HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW? WELL, HE NEVER DID WANT TO. I FIGGER HE PROBABLY AIN'T CHANGED HIS MIND MUCH, MM-HMM. HOW'D YOUR MAMA DIE? MMM. YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR THINGS LIKE 'AT. YOU JUST A BOY. YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT GOOD THOUGHTS WHILE YOU STILL A BOY. THEY'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR ALL THE OTHER, MM-HMM. I'VE HAD A LOT OF BAD THOUGHTS SINCE DADDY DIED. SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS STILL REAL LITTLE AND HE WAS STILL HERE. MAMA'S REAL GOOD, BUT I WISH I HAD BOTH OF THEM. WE WENT TO MEMPHIS IN THE CAR ONE TIME. IT WAS RAININ' SO HARD WE COULDN'T SEE THE ROAD, BUT I WASN'T SCARED... 'CAUSE AS LONG AS DADDY WAS DRIVIN' I THOUGHT NOTHIN' CAN HAPPEN TO US. THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT MAMA NOW. MAMA HAS A BOYFRIEND NOW. HIS NAME IS DOYLE HARGRAVES. HE WORKS CONSTRUCTION, SO HE MAKES A PRETTY GOOD LIVIN', BUT HE STILL DON'T HELP MAMA OUT WITH ANY MONEY THOUGH. HE AIN'T NO GOOD. HE'S MEAN TO HER. HE DON'T LIKE ME AT ALL. MAMA SAYS HE'S JEALOUS 'CAUSE I BELONG TO MY DADDY INSTEAD OF HIM. HE SPENDS THE NIGHT OVER AT OUR HOUSE SOMETIMES, AND HE'S GOT HIS OWN HOUSE. SOMEBODY TOLD ME THIS WAY HE CAN HAVE MORE GIRLFRIENDS. I LIKE IT ON THE NIGHTS HE AIN'T AT OUR HOUSE. I AIN'T SO NERVOUS THEN. HMM. HOW COME HER TO STILL BEIN' GIRLFRIENDS AND ALL WITH 'IM IF HE MEAN TO HER? SHE SAYS IT'S FOR THE TIMES WHEN HE'S GOOD TO HER. SHE'S LONELY SINCE DADDY DIED. SOMETIMES SHE DON'T KNOW WHY. HE THREATENED TO KILL HER IF SHE EVER LEFT 'IM. MY DADDY WOULD KILL HIM IF HE WAS STILL HERE AND SOMEBODY WAS MEAN TO MAMA. VAUGHAN, HE'S REAL GOOD TO MAMA. VAUGHAN, THAT YOU MET? BUT HE'S NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO DOYLE. HE'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. NOT "FUNNY," HA-HA. "FUNNY," QUEER. HE LIKES TO GO WITH MEN INSTEAD OF WOMEN. THAT MAKES HIM NOT BE ABLE TO FIGHT TOO GOOD, BUT HE SURE IS NICE THOUGH. HE'S FROM ST. LOUIS. PEOPLE WHO ARE QUEER GET ALONG BETTER IN A BIG TOWN. I WISH HE LIKED TO GO WITH WOMEN. I'D RATHER HIM BE MAMA'S BOYFRIEND THAN DOYLE. KARL, YOU KNOW WHEN I TOLD YOU... DADDY GOT HIT BY A TRAIN? YES, SIR, I RECOLLECT THAT. IT AIN'T THE TRUTH. HE SHOT HIMSELF WITH A SHOTGUN ON PURPOSE. HOW COME HIM TO DO THAT, RECKON? 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY... TO TAKE CARE OF US THE WAY HE WANTED TO. THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER SAID. HE GOT LAID OFF OF WORK AND STARTED WORKIN' ODD JOBS. I THOUGHT HE TOOK CARE OF US JUST FINE. KARL, DID YOU REALLY KILL SOMEBODY? YES, SIR, I DID. WHO'D YOU KILL? TWO PEOPLE. WERE THEY BAD PEOPLE? I THOUGHT THEY WAS. WELL, MAYBE THEY NEEDED IT. WELL, I GROWED UP AND LEARNED THAT... Y'AIN'T S'POSED TO KILL NOBODY. IT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU'RE LOOKIN' OUT FOR YOURSELF, IF IT'S SELF-DEFENSE. WAS IT SELF-DEFENSE? MMM. MY DADDY WAS GOOD. I THINK TOO MANY GOOD PEOPLE DIE. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. [Sighs] KARL, YOU SURE YOU WANNA GO STAY WITH THESE FOLKS? YOU'RE WELCOME TO KEEP ON STAYIN' HERE. IT'S WORKIN' OUT REAL GOOD.

TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S ON MY MIND. I'M JUST... I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT RIGHT OUT ON THE TABLE. WHERE DO I START? UM... LINDA AND FRANK ARE... ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY. MY OWN FAMILY... WAS NEVER LIKE A FAMILY. THEY'RE HORRIBLE PEOPLE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, FOR YEARS I PRAYED EVERY NIGHT THAT MY FATHER WOULD DIE... AND FINALLY I REALIZED, THROUGH A LOT OF THERAPY, I WAS WASTING MY ENERGY ON HATING HIM, SO NOW I JUST DON'T CARE. BUT YOU SEE, YOU AND I ARE A LOT ALIKE, AS STRANGE AS THAT MAY SEEM. I DON'T MEAN PHYSICALLY OR EVEN MENTALLY, REALLY, BUT, WELL, EMOTIONALLY. ACTUALLY, THE HAND THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALT IN LIFE, YOU KNOW... WE'RE DIFFERENT. PEOPLE SEE US AS, AS BEING DIFFERENT, ANYWAY. YOU'RE... WELL, YOU-YOU'VE GOT... YOUR AFFLICTION OR WHATEVER, AND I... WELL, MINE'S NOT AS EASY TO SEE. [Sighs] I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT. I'M GAY. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU, THAT I'M GAY? YOU KNOW WHAT "GAY" IS, DON'T YOU? [Customers Laughing] I DON'T RECKON. [Chattering, Laughing Continues] HOMOSEXUAL. I LIKE MEN, SEXUALLY. NOT "FUNNY," HA-HA. "FUNNY," QUEER. MM-HMM. WELL, THAT'S A VERY OFFENSIVE WAY TO PUT IT. YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT, KARL. YOU WERE TAUGHT THAT, WEREN'T YOU? I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT WAY, YES, SIR, MM-HMM. ANYWAY, I-IT'S HARD TO LIVE GAY... THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO SAY IT... IN A SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS. I'VE WANTED TO LEAVE MANY TIMES, BUT... BECAUSE I LOVE... LINDA, FRANK AND... A CERTAIN OTHER PERSON, I... THEY'VE KEPT ME FROM LEAVING. LOOK, ANYWAY, I'M RAMBLING. IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN THE WHEATLEY GARAGE, Y-YOU NEED TO KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. DOYLE IS A MONSTER. NOT JUST A CLOSED-MINDED REDNECK, BUT A MONSTER, A DANGEROUS PERSON. I'VE TOLD LINDA THAT ONE DAY THAT MAN IS GOING TO HURT HER AND THAT BOY, MAYBE EVEN KILL THEM. I SEE IT IN HIS EYES. I-I'M VERY IN TUNE. I'M MAYBE EVEN PSYCHIC. BUT DOYLE IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE HELL. THERE'S... THERE'S ONE MORE THING. [Chattering Continues] IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS WHY YOU WERE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL. EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR PAST. MAYBE... YOU TRIED SUICIDE; MAYBE YOU DID SOMETHING... TERRIBLE; BUT WHAT I SEE BEFORE ME... IS A GENTLE, SIMPLE MAN. ALL I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME... IS THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF BEING AROUND FRANK AND LINDA. YOU KNOW? YOU WOULD NEVER HURT EITHER ONE OF THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD YOU? I WOULDN'T NEVER HURT THEM, MMM. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. LOOK, I'M SORRY IF, IF I'VE OFFENDED YOU IN ANY WAY. YOU SEEM LIKE A THINKER, YOU KNOW. YOU SEEM TO ALWAYS BE DEEP IN THOUGHT. IT JUST... SO, TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING RIGHT NOW? MMM. I'S THINKIN' I... MIGHT WANNA TAKE ME SOME O' THESE POTATERS HOME WITH ME, MMM. OH. HOW ABOUT BEFORE THAT? MMM. LEMME THINK. MMM. BEFORE THAT I WAS THINKIN'... I COULD USE ME ANOTHER SIX OR EIGHT CANS OF THAT POTTED MEAT, IF YE GOT ANY EXTREE, MM-HMM. [Silverware Clanking] [Doyle] FRANKIE, GET SOME OF THIS SALAD. HOLD YOUR PLATE UP FOR ME, FRANKIE. I'M JUST GON' REACH. SO, HOW COME KARL WON'T EAT IN HERE WITH US? I DON'T KNOW. HE SAID HE'D EAT OUT THERE. I WOULDN'T LET IT GET TO YOU. PUT SOME OF THIS DRESSING ON THERE. YES. I JUST FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR THING. WHO THE HELL COULD EAT WITH HIM, MAKING ALL THAT GODDAMN RACKET IN HIS THROAT? IT'S RAUNCHY. HE DOES MAKE SOME FUNNY NOISES. I LIKE THE WAY HE TALKS. SOUNDS LIKE A RACE CAR MOTOR IDLIN'; MAKES ME NOT BE NERVOUS. YEAH, I'M GLAD OF IT, HONEY. WHAT DO YOU GOT TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT? YOU'RE A DAMN KID. YOU AIN'T GOT NO BILLS TO PAY; NO BUSINESS TO RUN; YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A JOB. YOU GOT NO OLD LADY EATIN' ON YOUR ASS ALL THE TIME. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST STAY NERVOUS.

BESIDES, THAT'S THE WAY FRIENDS DO ONE ANOTHER. FUCK IT. I'M CALLING 'EM UP. [Clears Throat] LINDA, GO OUT THERE IN THE GARAGE AND GET MY GUITAR. IT'S OUT THERE WITH THAT LOONEY TOON. NOW? YEAH, NOW.

YOU CAN WAIL ON THE GIG, BUT YA GOTTA PLAY THROUGH IT. NO, YOU PLAY THROUGH IT ON A GIG... YOU LIKE THAT, VAUGHAN? SURE. SOUNDS LIKE A NUMBER ONE HIT TUNE, ALL RIGHT. [Man Chuckles] [Doyle] HOW 'BOUT YOU, KARL? KARL, DID YOU LIKE THAT? I RECKON. [Man] I WISH YOU'D ALL LAY OFF FOR TONIGHT! I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK WITH THAT RACKET! HEY! WELL, IT'S NIGHTTIME.

JUST TRYING TO MAKE THESE TWO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF IT, BABY. COME ON, VAUGHAN. THIS'LL BE FUN. KARL, LET'S GO. COME ON. [Doyle] YOU BETTER LAY OFF ON THAT TAMBOURINE. [Morris] HEY, MAN, I AIN'T DID NOTHIN' WRONG. HEY! AIN'T ANYBODY GONNA COME GET ME? [Car Doors Close] WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [Morris] EXACTLY THE POINT, MY YOUNG LEVELHEADED FRIEND. I DON'T GET IT. WELL, I REST MY CASE. MORRIS IS REAL SMART WITH PHILOSOPHIES AND THINGS. THAT'S WHY HIM AND ME IS THE SONGWRITIN' TEAM OF OUR GROUP. SEE, I COME UP WITH THE GOOD TUNES, OR MELODIES AS WE CALL 'EM, AND, UM, MORRIS IS THE LYRICS. NOT UNLIKE GARY BOOKER OF THE PROCOL HARUM. WE DON'T EVER PLAY ANY SONGS Y'ALL WROTE. I AIN'T HEARD ONE OF 'EM. Y'ALL'S JUST TALK. WE DON'T EVEN PLAY ANY SONGS WITH WORDS AT ALL THAT I REMEMBER. WE AIN'T GOT NO FUCKIN' MICROPHONE! WE AIN'T GOT NO SPEAKERS SET UP! WE WROTE ONE LAST NIGHT OUTSIDE THE MINI-MART. UM, MORRIS CALLED IT "STUART DRIVES A COMFORTABLE CAR." AND THEN, LIKE IN COUNTRY SONGS, YOU KNOW, IN PARENTHESES... IT SAYS, "THERE'S USUALLY SOMEONE IN THE TRUNK." AND, UM, I CAME UP WITH A TUNE, JUST A-HUMMIN'. SEE, YOU DON'T WANNA QUESTION A GENIUS, VAUGHAN. MORRIS HERE, HE'S A MODERN-DAY POET, KINDA LIKE IN THE OLDEN TIMES. YEAH, I GOT A NEW TUNE. THIS NEW COMPOSITION'S ENTITLED "THE THRILL." GOES SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS. I STAND ON THE HILL, NOT FOR A THRILL, BUT FOR A BREATH OF A FRESH KILL. NEVER MIND THE MAN WHO CONTEMPLATES... DOIN' AWAY WITH LICENSE PLATES. HE STANDS ALONE ANYHOW, BAKIN' THE COOKIES OF DISCONTENT... BY THE HEAT OF THE LAUNDROMAT VENT. LEAVING HIS SOUL... THEN, LIKE IN POETRY, I GO DOT, DOT, DOT. YOU KNOW, KINDA OFF-CENTER, THEN I DROP DOWN, AND THEN I GO: LEAVIN' HIS SOUL... PARTIN' THE WATERS O' THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA... OF... [Wails] MANKIND. THAT A DAMN GOOD SONG, WASN'T IT, DOYLE? YOU LIKE THAT SONG? ALL RIGHT! [Laughs] I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I BELIEVE THE "DOT, DOT, DOT" COME BETWEEN... "MEDULLA" AND "OBLONGATA." WELL, IT DID. THE "DOTS" ARE WHERE I SAY THEY ARE. MELODY AND TUNE, THAT'S YOUR TRADE, TERENCE. YOU'RE A TUNESMITH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORDS. Y'ALL DON'T SHUT UP, I'M GONNA GO OUTTA MY MIND. 'SIDES, KARL HERE'S LIABLE TO BUST HIS SPRING. HE'S ALREADY OFF BALANCE. THAT WASN'T THE WAY YOU MADE IT UP BEFORE, MORRIS. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. WE DON'T NEED NO FANCY WORDS. I MEAN, WE NEED TO PRACTICE. WE NEED TO REHEARSE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE NEED. WE NEED SOME PAYIN' GIGS. WE DON'T NEED THIS MESSIN' AROUND. FIRST, ONE PATIO AND THEN ANOTHER. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. AMEN, JOHNSON. WE DON'T GOT NO GODDAMN BAND! WE DON'T NEED TO FUCKIN' PRACTICE, RANDY! WE DON'T NEED A SHIT-ASS MANAGER NEITHER! YA MOTHERFUCKERS! Y'ALL JUST A BUNCH OF LOSERS! I'M THE ONLY SANE SON OF A BITCH HERE! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE, DOYLE, IT'S LINDA'S. I'LL WHIP THE DOG SHIT OUT OF YOU, BOY. I WILL FUCKIN' KILL YOU IF YOU TALK TO ME AGAIN! NOW, ALL OF YA, GET THE FUCK OUT NOW BEFORE I GET TOO MAD TO TURN BACK! WH-WHAT ABOUT OUR INSTRUMENTS? C'MERE, YOU LITTLE PRICK. COME HERE, YOU LITTLE FUCKIN' PRICK! GET OUT! ALL OF Y'ALL! NOW GET THE FUCK OUT! COME ON, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS! GET THE FUCK OUT! RANDY, YOU TUNIN' SON OF A BITCH! GO FUCKIN' PRACTICE, RANDY! COME ON, MORRIS, YOU FUCKIN' GENIUS! GET THE FUCK UP, AND GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE! GODDAMN IT! THIS AIN'T RIGHT, DOYLE. THEY IS SOMETHIN' WRONG WITH YOU. GET THE FUCK OUT. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE THIS SHIT, MAN. DOTS LOOK GOOD ON PAPER. YOU DON'T SING 'EM ANYWAY. YOU'RE JUST SHOWIN' YOUR TRUE ARIES COLOR NOW. STAY OUTTA MY GODDAMN FACE, YOU FUCKIN' BUZZARD. [Slams] HEY! I SAID, GET OUTTA MY HOUSE! THAT GOES FOR COCKSUCKERS AND RETARDS. NOW, GET UP OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO! COME ON! THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUSE, DOYLE. THIS IS MY HOUSE, AND I'LL SAY WHO STAYS AND WHO GOES. YOU GOT A HOUSE. GO GET ONE OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS AND GO HOME TO IT. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT WHEN I'M HURTIN', LINDA. DON'T MAKE ME KNOCK THE PISS OUTTA YOU. DON'T YOU TOUCH HER. THAT'S FUNNY, VAUGHAN. LINDA, GO TO BED, AND TAKE LITTLE SNOTNOSE HERE WITH YA. YOU'RE NOT STAYIN' HERE TONIGHT. GO GET SOBER BEFORE YOU COME BACK. I'M TIRED OF MY CHILD SEEIN' THIS. NOW, YOU GET YOUR ASS STRAIGHT, OR I'LL LOCK YOUR ASS OUTTA MY LIFE FER GOOD. IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT LEAVIN' ME, LINDA, I TOLD YA, I'M GONNA KILL YOU DEADER THAN A DOORNAIL. THAT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN THIS. I'M A WITNESS. I HEARD YOU THREATEN HER. YOU GET THE FUCK OUT NOW! LEAVE! DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO, LINDA. LEAVE! DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. LEAVE! DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. LEAVE! DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, LINDA! DON'T DO THAT, LINDA! ALL RIGHT, I'M CALLING THE POLICE! GODDAMN YOU, LITTLE PRICK! DON'T TOUCH MY MOMMY! DON'T TOUCH HER! HEY! [Bottle Shatters] GO HOME! GET AWAY FROM HERE, DOYLE! HEY! GODDAMN YOU, FRANKIE! FRANK! [Frank] GET AWAY FROM US! [Bottle Shatters] [Grunts, Shouts] GET AWAY FROM US! ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW. FUCK ME. FUCK ME. I'M GONNA GO HOME AND SOBER UP. [Panting] GO ON, THEN. EVERYTHING'S BOTHERIN' ME. I'M HURTIN', LINDA. I LOVE YOU. WELL, I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICK! NO, I DON'T. NO, I DON'T. I LOVE YOUR MAMA. I JUST... I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT GOES ON. YOU BUNCH OF FREAKS. I HOPE YOU HAVE FUN. [Panting] I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. I'M SORRY, HONEY. I SAID I'M SORRY, LINDA. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN KISS MY ASS. AND IF YOU EVER HIT ME AGAIN, YOU LITTLE BASTARD, I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL MAKE YOU SORRY YOUR DADDY EVER SQUIRTED YOUR ASS OUT. YOU HEAR ME? [Car Door Closes, Engine Starts] Y'ALL RIGHT, MAMA? YEAH, I'M FINE. LET'S JUST TRY AND FORGET ABOUT TONIGHT. WE DON'T NEED TO THINK ABOUT BAD THOUGHTS, DO WE, MAMA? [Chuckles] NO, HONEY, WE DON'T. WELL, I'LL MAKE SOME COFFEE AND START CLEANIN' UP THIS MESS. KARL, YOU WANT SOME COFFEE, HON? COFFEE KINDLY MAKES ME NERVOUS WHEN I DRINK IT, MM-HMM. [Sighs] OH, YOU SCARED ME. I DIDN'T AIM TO. YOU WANNA SIT DOWN? YOU NEED SOMETHING? NO, MA'AM. MMM. THERE'S THESE TWO FELLERS STANDIN' ON A BRIDGE... A-GOIN' TO THE BATHROOM. ONE FELLER SAYS THAT THE WATER IS COLD, THE OTHER FELLER SAID THE WATER IS DEEP. MMM, I BELIEVE ONE FELLER COME FROM ARKANSAS. GET IT? I'LL BE DOG. RECKON YOU CAN MAKE ME SOME BISCUITS? WHAT, NOW? WHENEVER YOU TAKE A NOTION TO. I DON'T AIM TO PUT YOU OUT NONE. WELL, IT IS NEARLY BREAKFAST TIME, ANYWAY. I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP. I HAVE TO BE AT WORK IN THREE HOURS.

WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE'S SLOW. SHE'S A LITTLE BIT... I THINK... SHE'S NOT RETARDED, JUST... WELL, IT DON'T MATTER. LISTEN TO ME. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO MEET HER. VAUGHAN WANTS TO HAVE A LITTLE SUPPER OVER AT HIS HOUSE, AND WE COULD INVITE HER. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? I RECKON I WOULDN'T MIND HAVIN' A LITTLE SUPPER, MM-HMM. VAUGHAN'S FRIEND'LL BE THERE TOO. HE WORKS AT THE FUNERAL HOME. FRANK... YOU KNOW, FRANK REALLY LIKES YOU A LOT. HE SAYS YOU MAKE HIM FEEL CALM. I LIKE FRANK. HE'S A GOOD BOY. ME AND HIM MADE FRIENDS. IT AIN'T RIGHT FOR ME TO KEEP FROM TELLIN' YOU HOW COME ME... TO BE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL. OH, THAT'S OKAY. IT'S NOT REALLY MY BUSINESS. I HAVE WONDERED, THOUGH. WHY WAS IT? WAS IT LIKE A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN OR... I KILLED MY MOTHER AND AN OLD BOY NAMED JESSE DIXON. I THOUGHT THEY'S A-DOIN' WRONG. I WAS ABOUT YOUR BOY'S AGE. THEY TOLD ME I'M WELL FROM IT NOW. WAS THAT YOU? I REMEMBER THAT. I WAS ONLY THREE OR FOUR, BUT I ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT IT GROWIN' UP. THEY SAY YOU'RE WELL? YES, MA'AM. MMM. I LIKE YOUR GARAGE. I NEVER WOULD HURT YOU OR THAT BOY.

IT TAKES YER MIND OFF O' EVERYTHING ELSE, AND WHEN YOU'RE RUNNIN' REAL FAST TRYIN' TO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, THAT'S ALL YOU'RE THINKIN' ABOUT. I AIN'T NO ACCOUNT, BUT DADDY ALWAYS SAID HE WAS PROUD OF ME... WHEN I THREW THE BALL OR RAN WITH IT. DID YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS GROWIN' UP TO PLAY WITH? I HAD ONE THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT, UH, IT DIDN'T GET OLD ENOUGH FOR ME TO PLAY WITH IT, MMM. WHY NOT? IT DIE? YES, SIR. WHY? IT GOT BORNED A LITTLE TOO EARLY. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY MADE IT COME OUT TOO EARLY SOME WAY OR ANOTHER. SO IT DIED WHEN IT COME OUT? MY DADDY COME OUT TO THE SHED AND GOT ME AND SAID, "HERE, TAKE THIS AND THROW IT AWAY," AND HANDED ME A TOWEL WITH SOMETHIN' OR 'NOTHER IN IT. MMM. I STARTED FOR THAT BARREL, AND... I OPENED UP THE TOWEL TO SEE WHAT WAS IN THERE 'CAUSE THERE'S A NOISE... AND SOMETHIN' WAS MOVIN' AROUND IN IT, MMM. AND THAT TOWEL WAS ALL BLOODY-LIKE ALL AROUND IT THERE, AND... MMM. IT WAS A LITTLE OL' BABY NOT NO BIGGER THAN A SQUIRREL, MMM. IT WAS ALIVE? YES, SIR. RIGHT THEN IT WAS. A BOY OR A GIRL? IT WAS A LITTLE OL' BOY. YOU THREW IT IN THE TRASH BARREL? WELL, THAT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME, SO I WENT IN THERE IN THE SHED AND GOT A SHOE BOX AND EMPTIED OUT... THE SCREWDRIVERS AND WASHERS AND NUTS AND THINGS OUT OF IT. AND I TAKEN THE LITTLE FELLER AND PUT HIM IN THE BOX, BURIED HIM BACK THERE IN A CORNER OF THE YARD. THAT SEEMED MORE PROPER TO ME, I RECKON. AND IT WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN YOU BURIED IT? I HEARED IT A-CRYIN' A LITTLE THROUGH THAT BOX, MMM. THAT DON'T SEEM RIGHT. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WOULD'VE KEPT HIM... AND TOOK CARE OF HIM IF HE WAS YOUR BROTHER. I WASN'T BUT SIX OR EIGHT. I RECKON I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR NO BABY. MY MOTHER AND FATHER DIDN'T WANT HIM. THEY LEARNED ME TO DO WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO. THESE DAYS I FIGURE IT PROBABLY BEST... WE JUST GIVE HIM RIGHT BACK TO THE GOOD LORD RIGHT OFF THE BAT ANYHOW. THAT MAKES ME FEEL REAL SAD. COULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING, KARL? I WOULD HAVE. I WISHED I'D HAD HIM. HE'D STILL BE RIGHT HERE NOW, LIVIN'. IT MAKES ME SAD TOO. I WISH THEY'S SOMETHIN' I COULDA DID ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK NOTHIN' BAD OUGHTA HAPPEN TO CHILDREN. I THINK ALL THOSE BAD THINGS OUGHTA BE SAVED UP FOR THE FOLKS THAT DONE GROWED UP. THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT, MM-HMM. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT. A BOY YOUR AGE OUGHT NOT TO HEAR SUCH THINGS. IT JUST KINDA COME OUT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY NOTHIN' BAD ABOUT YE. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU DON'T MEAN NO HARM. D'YOU EVER THINK ABOUT KILLIN' YOURSELF ON PURPOSE, LIKE DADDY DID? I STUDIED ABOUT IT SOME. BIBLE SAYS YOU OUGHT NOT TO, SAYS YOU DO THAT, YOU GO OFF TO HADES. SOME FOLKS CALL THAT HELL. I CALL IT HADES, MM-HMM. THE BIBLE SAYS THE SAME THING ABOUT KILLIN' OTHERS TOO. MMM. YES, SIR, I RECKON IT DOES. SPEND MORE TIME OVER HERE, AND... WELL, HELL, THERE'S THE BOYS. HOW YA DOIN', BOYS? I'M GLAD Y'ALL CAME BACK. I WAS WANTIN' TO TALK TO Y'ALL TOO. COME OVER HERE AND SIT DOWN. COME ON, SIT DOWN. I WAS JUST TELLIN' LINDA WE WERE THINKIN'... THAT THINGS'D BE A LOT BETTER IF I SPENT A LOT MORE TIME OVER HERE, AND THAT WE COULD, UH... AW, HELL, I'LL JUST START OVER. SEE, I TOOK OFF WORK EARLY TODAY, AND YOUR MAMA WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THE SAME... SO THAT WE COULD TALK. REALLY, WHAT I'D COME OVER HERE TO DO WAS APOLOGIZE, WHICH AIN'T EASY FOR ME, ABOUT HOW I ACTED THE OTHER NIGHT. NOW, I ADMITTED I WAS DRUNK. I GOT ALL WORKED UP, AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND... I CARE ABOUT Y'ALL, THOUGH. I DO, REALLY. NOW, I DON'T MEAN TO BE SO... DAMNED... WELL, "ASSHOLE-ISH," I GUESS, WOULD BE THE WORD. KARL, I DON'T BELIEVE I HIT YOU, DID I?
