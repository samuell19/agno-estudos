I thought I was a goner when a guy grabbed my hair, but I still beat him somehow. Biked it. I fought every day through high school and never cut my hair. I wound up with my own gang and my hair touching the ground.

Now that I've changed schools, my delinquent days are over. I won't fight anymore. I'll study hard and live an honest life. Just you watch, punks! Just You Watch, Punks! I'll beat the crap out of anyone who gets in my way! Beating people up isn't part of an honest life. Everyone has secrets in their past they want to hide. I can accept that, but people can't change so easily. If he causes any trouble to this school, I'll have him transferred. Huh? Oh, so he's the transfer student, huh? What? What're ya staring at?! Oh, I'm sorry! My eyes are bad, so I just... Looks like normalcy will be an uphill battle for him. I forgot. Normies don't get into fights when their eyes meet. Normies = Normal People Oh, sorry. Normies wouldn't hit others with fire extinguishers from behind when they brush shoulders! Normies Decent People Normal People Not many delinquents would, either. Pat Pat Pat Pat Pat Pat Pat I can't do anything! It's like I'm tied to a leash! Sounds like you needed one. Oh, hey, transfer student! You're overusing that. Wh-Who the hell is he? He must be a delinquent. And he looks like he's picking a fight. How interesting... I guess I've got some time to kill! Time to Kill Wait, no! I said I ain't gonna fight anymore! Oh? You're not gonna take that off? I slipped into an accent without thinking. That was close! What are ya, chicken? What?! Well, of course you would be. I might not look like it, but I'm actually a delinquent. Well, yeah. Otherwise with that face, you'd just be an idiot. Sorry, he is just an idiot. I've mellowed out now, but I used to do some pretty crazy stuff. War stories, huh? Fine, lay them on me. Oh? Like what? The meanest thing I did was when I chased mosquitoes around with a mosquito coil. I also ate a whole watermelon all by myself. I was seriously crazy. You see? He's just an idiot. Hang in there, kid! Irritated That delinquent wannabe seriously pisses me off!

P-Please don't hurt me! Huh?! What're you looking at?! Beat it! Now, hurry it up. I-I'll give it to you right away. What?! Mind if I tear you to shreds?! Don't show such trashy behavior in front of me, scumbag! I'm gonna teach you a lesson! Like I said, people can't change so easily. You didn't see nothin'. Got that?! P-Please don't hurt me! Well, I guess I can overlook this. Transfer Student, First Encounters It's been a week since I transferred to this school. Rigor Mortis No one has found out that I'm a former delinquent. So why do I still not have any buds here? Up until now, it was as simple as beating up guys who picked a fight with me. Yes No The delinquent got up and is now looking at you as if he wants to join you. Let him join? But now that I can't fight, how do I get some buds? Okay! Just sitting here thinking won't do me any good. I'll go talk to people. That guy's no good. If I hang out with a delinquent, it'll ruin everything. I can't stand that guy's face. I might punch him without thinking. Oh? That guy might be good. His name was... I can't remember. Doesn't matter. I'll try talking with this wimpy-looking guy. Hey, I'm Kuboyasu. Wanna throw down, punk? So this guy shot this other guy, breaking the pledge of brotherhood between them. Good grief. I've done nothing but ignoring him, but he just goes on and on about some dumb yakuza movie. And the way he talks about it is beyond terrible. Just how many guys are there? The guys... The guys... This is too much. I didn't want to resort to this, but this calls for... ...my annoyed face. How's that? You don't need psychic powers to drive people away. W-Well then, later. I can't believe that normie gave me such an annoyed look! But now I understand. I have nothing in common with these people! Hey, newbie. My name is The Jet-Black Wings. This is a world of stillness, naught but a cage for sheep awaiting death's embrace. This is hopeless. I can't understand what normal people say at all! What kind of life will you lead? If you're going to raise arms, come with me. Dark Reunion's awakening is at hand! Watch out. That guy isn't a normal person. We have to complete the Grand Cross soon and house the engraved seal of Cross! Grand Cross?! I have heard of that! Biker gang formed and led by Daizaburou Arashiyama 25 years ago, the first to conquer northern Kanto. After Arashiyama died in a sudden accident, it met its end to internal strife. Still, its legend survives. Grand Cross Oh, right! That's the legendary... What? You know about it?! That's not the same thing! Yeah. They annihilated Samantha and Paramount! Samantha Paramount Whoa. To think you're even familiar with Samantha and Paramount... They somehow got on the same page. I'm glad that I found someone with something in common with me. Oh! Are you the transfer student? Y-Yeah. I transferred to this school, too! Who the hell is he? You're also a Year 2, second term transfer? No, it was quite a bit ago. Let's see... it was in the second term in Year 2. Anyway, this school has a ton of cute girls. It's great! Don't act like we're buds! By the way, were there cute girls at your old school? You should introduce me to some of them! Well, I guess I act friendly with someone like him, too. Well, I went to a boys school, so... What a scumbag, chasing after women! And he calls himself a man?! Ah, Kuboyasu, right? H... H... Hey... Have you gotten used to this school? I'm Kokomi Teruhashi. We're in the same class. I hope you'll remember me. Though it's not like you could ever forget me. Hey? No-Oh? What a hot chick... I've never seen someone like her before. I Live 4 Kokomi I even feel compelled to put I live 4 Kokomi on my arm! Hey! I'm acting just like that guy! I can't give in to that shit! Never give in! You can do it! You can do it! Exceed your limits! That guy is our class rep. Why the hell is he doing sit-ups in the hallway? I should just keep my distance from weirdos like him. Go, Hairo! You're as fired up as ever! He's popular? A guy like that?! Hi, Kuboyasu! Would you like to do sit-ups with me? Forget it, Hairo. Kuboyasu doesn't seem into sports and stuff. He's all skin and bones, too. Let's see how you feel after I do a workout on you guys. Stop it, you guys. You shouldn't judge someone you don't know based on their appearance. Well, you shouldn't judge anyone, whether you know them or not! Only you can decide what your limits are. This guy... Who cares what others say? It's up to you in the end. He's saying the same thing my old boss said! Who would've thought someone like him is here, too? I'm Aren Kuboyasu. Nice to meet you. Yeah, likewise, Kuboyasu! This is the first time I wanted to be buds with someone. By the way, why were you doing sit-ups out here? There's this incredible guy I want to defeat. A man even he acknowledges? Just what is he like? This guy?! Wait. Is he so crazy that beating guys isn't even worth mentioning? I'm itching for a fight. I have to know who's stronger! Oh, hey, pal! Pal? In other words, someone as tough as a guy Hairo can't defeat? This guy?! I went full circle and came back to him! You shouldn't judge others based on their looks, but this can't be right! How is Plan Alpha coming along, Saiki? Hello, Saiki! How're you doing, Saiki? Hi, Saiki! What's going on? Everyone's gathering around that normie. Don't tell me... He's the one pulling the strings?! I'm never using my annoyed face ever again. Foretell it! Psychic Power Development Lab Just who will win? Foretell it. Find out later in the episode! Find out later in the episode! Find out later in the episode! Find out later in the episode! Reunited! Mr. and Mrs. Nendou Sorry to drag you along to visit my dad's grave with me. Hmph. Not like it was out of my way. Seriously, give me a break. I only came because Kaidou really wanted me to, but... Good grief. This was a mistake. Nendou Family Grave Hey, where are you praying? He's over here. Next to me. Hm? What're you guys doing? Nendou's Father (Ghost) Visiting your grave. I may be a psychic, but I don't have the ability to see ghosts. Other than this guy, for some reason. One Nendou is already too many. I can't handle two of them. Oh, hello. Now there are three of them! Mom! You came, too? Thanks for looking after Riki. I hope you'll stay good friends with him. Kaidou, I sympathize, but stop staring. Is there something on my face? Ah! No! I'm sorry! He's looking after me, too! That's the original. Huh? Ah! Sorry, my mistake! Yeah, I'm looking after you! Shut your mouth, you idiot! That's the mother. I'm sorry. Um, I know this sounds very rude, but you look a lot like your son. Yeah, that is rude. My son and I look alike? Hey, stop joking. Yes, please stop joking. He takes after his father. He doesn't look like me at all. He really looks like his dad. Right, Riki? Hm? Did you let your hair grow out, Riki? That's you. ha ha ha What's with them?! They're like clones!

With no memories of his former life, he has no idea what his own face looks like. If he did, he'd know these two are related to him in an instant. But man, these two are weirdly interesting... Come visit and have dinner with us. Come in already! Is this your room? Yep. The opportunity has finally come! I'm gonna find the forbidden sealed porno mags! You mean the kind that scumbag collects? Where are they?! Are they here?! I found one! So he reads this filth! This... filth... I-I'm gonna put this here, okay? What are you trying to accomplish? Oh, right. I came all the way to Nendou's house to look for hints on what's keeping him in this world. Stare... Stare.... Hm? What's he looking at? That's his own picture. What will he do? His old man looks exactly the same, too! This was a waste of time. I'm going home. It's been seventeen years. The loneliness and sorrow have faded, but it still feels like he's close by. That's because he is. Actually, you're sitting on him. Maybe it's just that my son looks almost exactly like him. You boys make yourself at home! What now? He got all quiet. Hey, is something wrong? ...th her... What? I've fallen in love with her! I felt deep love towards that woman! Hold it! Wait! Well, they were married originally. I beg you! Tell her how I feel, will you? Leave me out of this mess! Hey, I beg you! I just want you to tell her, that's all! Then I can pass on happily! Oh... Ack! Panic S-S-Saiki! What took you so long?! Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Reading that, huh? Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Panic Where's Nendou? He's right over there. He fell asleep even though he has guests over. How convenient. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Oh, what's in your hand? Um! This is...! Huh? What're you gonna do? Whoa! What're you doing?! Calm down. I'm getting you a body. I can extract the astral body from anyone who's unconscious, excluding myself. But if I don't put them back within 44 seconds, they'll go to heaven. With this, you can now use Nendou's body. Huh? Whoa! What the heck?! My body feels heavy! I can touch things! Like that, you can tell her how you feel yourself. Now, go. But I wish it was a better looking guy... Go! All right! I'll go tell her! You've got thirty seconds left. Hey, you! That's not how you should talk to your mother! I'm in love! Huh? Well, I don't know how to say it well, but I've been smitten! Just a single glance makes my heart beat like a drum. You're someone I really... Hey, Riki! What's wrong?! So he's passed on? His lingering regrets must have faded after he told her his feelings. Now, rest in peace. What was that about? So he's become a man, huh? I didn't realize this magazine he was hiding meant so much to him. I'll have to give this back to him. You've got it wrong! Rest in peace. Reviving Cafe Mami!

You need to work on your tact. I've been a longtime regular at this cafe. Their coffee and coffee jelly are pretty decent. It's quiet in here, too. There aren't that many customers... Oh, am I the only customer? We've had very few customers these days. Ever since that place opened, we've steadily lost business. The manager's been in a funk. Tall, my ass! Grande? It's medium and large! What are we, Westerners?! He's upset one moment, but calm the next. Sigh Cafes are a thing of the past. Tee-hee And then, he starts mocking them. Two Grande Strawberry Macchiatos, please! He sounds like an emotional train wreck. I've always had to apologize a lot since I keep dropping and breaking plates. But now I can apologize before they even hit the floor! You should work on not dropping them. Hey, enough chit-chatting. You're on the job. I'm sorry! If you're free, you can always go refill water glasses, or collect used plates, right? Yes, but we don't have any other customers. Well then, I guess I'll head home now. You're going to that new shop too, aren't you?! I'm just going home. I get so anxious when I think about this cafe going out of business. Chisato... You care so much about this cafe? I don't think I can remember all those new words. Tall, Grande... ...and Piccolo? Enorme? Is working there your backup plan?! I still need to earn a living. Fine! It's all over! We'll go out of business! I know! Let's brainstorm ways to bring back our customers! Saiki's here too, so we can ask him about how customers feel. I want compensation. We'll now commence the meeting to discuss the revival of Cafe Mami. Or to drive that shop out of business. No, I might have to go work there. Good grief. I've thought this for a while, but...

We should make the interior cuter, too. Or better yet, what if we changed the coffee name to Angel's Sweet Respite? Sorry. On second thought, I want to keep the cafe as-is.

He got hooked on that show. Joker Magic Eye Detective Magic Eye Detective Joker. It's a detective drama that's all the rage right now. But I don't care for it. I don't know if they're trying to start a trend, I see... but it annoys me how he says that in every episode. And with Tohru Mugami in the lead role, I don't have the slightest inclination to watch it. I see... But it looks like Kaidou has gotten completely taken in. I see... His impression is off though. Hm? It seems like there's a commotion. This is... This commotion is caused by...! My right eye is twitching! I smell a crime! Is it your ears, eye, or nose that's alerting you? Whoa! The glass door is broken! Who did this? I see...! He looks happy. Hm?! Chief Inspector Hairo! Oh, good morning, Kaidou! ..."Chief Inspector"? Tell me what you know about this case. Oh, I don't know much about it myself, but I heard Mr. Matsuzaki was the first to see it. He came to unlock the door earlier this morning. He was also the one who locked the door last night. It wasn't broken then. There's no doubt about it. So the incident likely occurred between when he left at 11 p.m. and returned at 5 a.m. That's "not knowing much"? Anything else out of the ordinary?

The perp showed up after Matsuzaki left school, broke the glass door to enter the building, and then stole the vase from the principal's office! The perp was after that vase! Everyone's already figured out that much, Mr. Detective. Okay! The police can take it from here. I thought you were the detective? I'm not sure if that's what happened. Look closely. Don't those glass shards look odd? Ah! This is...! Right. TK... Takahashi! No. I was talking about how the shards mostly fell outside, not inside. What?! Oh, you mean that! If it was broken from the inside, the only one who could do it was Mr. Matsuzaki. Where's Matsuzaki right now? The principal's office. It seems like they suspect him. But he's keeping quiet about the vase. Oh? Then Matsuzaki broke the glass door? Beats me. To be honest, I have no idea who did it, either. My right eye is...! Move! TK-hashi! Find someplace else to crouch! What happened to your hands? Gulp! I just got some cuts. Oh? He seemed quite shaken. "Got some cuts"? Takahashi! Did you survive Matsuzaki's lecture yesterday? Ah... Y-Yeah. You said you'd come see us after that, but you never showed. Well, something urgent came up! "Lecture"... "Something urgent"... You're the culprit! Wha?! What are you doing, Kaidou? Even if it's Takahashi, it's not nice to accuse him out of the blue! Saying it like that wasn't nice, either. What on Earth are you talking about? Woooooo Hmph. You took the vase from the principal's office, didn't you? Gulp! That reaction is so blatant! Takahashi! Did you...! Rumble H-How did you figure it out?! Hmph. Your hands told me. Takahashi held a grudge after being scolded by Matsuzaki yesterday. So he broke the glass from the outside and moved the shards Rumble so that it'd look like Matsuzaki did it! That's what caused those cuts on your hands. And what you're carrying in that bag... It's obviously a vase! Ah! He's right! Um, what? Sorry, what're you guys talking about? What?! Principal's Office And so... We're sorry! Mr. Matsuzaki scolded me yesterday, so I got mad and ended up breaking the vase. I promised him that I'd apologize to you with him if he fixed the vase, so I kept quiet until now. We sincerely apologize! And so... don't worry about it. So he got those cuts when he fixed the vase, huh? Then why was the glass door broken? Who was it that broke the glass? I finally figured it out when I used psychometry on the glass. Last night, I remembered that I had left my umbrella at school. So I apported it with a tennis ball of equivalent value. But the tennis ball got precariously stuck in the umbrella rack, and it shot off. It was me. I sincerely apologize. The wind is blowing softly Drops of water are glistening all around Our usual road home looks so lovely today But if I were to be perfectly honest, The splendor came not from the sun But from your smiles so close beside me I wish I could get even 1% closer to you And finally free my locked up feelings for you I saw you from across the bridge Surrounded by the fresh scent of rain The ground mirrored our images And I wished that time would stop right there Preview Seriously, I want to be left alone. And yet, another pain-in-the-neck came along. Next time on The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. the anime... Here come the fall school event episodes.
