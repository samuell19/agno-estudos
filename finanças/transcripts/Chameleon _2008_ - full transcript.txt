Let's not go that route Paper-scissors-rock! You got back to Japan... 3 years ago? Yeah, well You were 25 Since then? l'd had a pretty active life, so l became a regular slacker A slacker, who's depressed and cons weddings Which is why l've got no credibility whatsoever Even if l told them l saw you there, they'd ask me what l was doing l'll shut up my 3 guys No matter what, l won't let them talk So can't you leave us alone? What do you mean, ''No matter what?'' You drugged or tortured that witness, right? He'll be dumped somewhere tomorrow. Total amnesia He'll never testify in Parliament Where did you fight? What? Ex-fighters rub their hands like that To keep their heart and lungs in shape So, you were a fighter? l only trained You breathe even a word, and you do know what the punishment will be To the marrow of my bones. There's no way out lt's not much, but take it You've spared us the trouble of executing you... Not that we would Who do you think l am? Don't look down on me... ls what l'd like to say, but can't. How pathetic Could l take 4 or 5 bills for carfare? ''Who's behind me...'' l'm a serious Astrologist l don't hold... You're the chameleon... How's your aging problem been? Yourself? Doesn't matter. You paid me but l never told your fortune Your birth date? l think it was September 22... More or less More or less? Won't work? lt's fine, you're a Virgo. Hold on Listen, if you have to look it up in some books...

Rhymes with Gogo girl Mine's Koike Keiko. My name's all K's l don't mean you, but l have lousy luck with men The guy l considered marrying was a marriage con man My parents said l was the fool and cut me off So now l'm broke l decided to join the cons That's why l tell fake fortunes Keep the change Thanks Use this to go home Hey! Don't insult me ls what l'd like to say, but can't. How pathetic Hey! Don't worry about me. All of Tokyo's my pad l can always crash a massage parlor Are you... ls there... a reason you don't want to sleep with me? The man taken into custody on this bridge early this morning, has been identified as lshibashi Tomoyasu, the missing Japan Real Estate Corporation executive Mr. lshibashi appears physically unharmed and healthy, but suffers from amnesia, and is unresponsive to questions from the police and his family As a result, the recently postponed... l'm with the news desk. Can l help? Parliamentary Hearings will be delayed further Unbelievable lt's good. Let's go with it! Where was this? The Oriental Plaza Hotel basement When? The afternoon before the Hearing.

Department of Transportation, who found out it's your son's car He could be charged with hit-and-run Shall l call the police? The timing's all wrong What's going on? According to Kosuke, we don't have any marks lined up for wedding fraud Jun had a great idea Just the sort of idea from a yakuza in training l'm not really into it. lt's a one-note drama l considered the ''fake-son'' con, but it's not exactly our style We put the mark on some new millionaire, and when his kid drives out in some fancy car, bingo! We offer a friendly settlement, for at least 1 million Who's she? l heard you have a spare room on the 2nd floor, practically free She cons people, too That's a little harsh But your little scheme won't work -Why not? -Listen, with wedding fraud, the marks have no idea they've been tricked With your scheme they'll know they've been tricked when the son comes Oh, guess you're right No, please hold on This new millionaire with the kid and the fancy car Say, l stuff a pillow up my dress and... ''lt's true!'' ''He is your son, right?'' ''He's definitely my baby's father!'' ''How can you be so cold?'' That's the pitch All of you, Granny, Grandpa, too, start crying All my brothers are furious and then it's your turn You're training to be a yakuza, right? Yo, my older sister here... Younger sister Younger... You think you can get off knockin' up my younger sister without paying? This way, even when the son comes home after the panicked parents have paid money, they won't figure it out because the son plays with lots of girls And they won't go to the cops Sounds like a really meaty role Sounds like we got ourselves a new young actress A genius! Being called a genius is a little... You had a hard time, didn't you? Have you prayed for the baby? l've been praying for mine, all these 50 years Grandma Nori, are you nuts? lt's just a story she made up lt's all right Women use tears to flush their pain Then you'll be ready for new pain OK? What's all this about? l want to party hard tonight lt's time we all got drunk together What! For real! lt's true! For real! l'll die, l'll die on you! That's how they crashed into our car That's back when they were seriously depressed Kosuke and Goro were And that's how we all started living together here ldiots! l'm depressed! Depressed! Depressed! Enough to shoot you! So, Kosuke's going back to the sea to become a fisherman lt'll fix his depression lt's fixable! A man of the sea! Who? Who goes there? Shut up Who? Who goes there? ''As requested, l presumptuously announce myself'' ''l hail from the village of Kunisada...'' Boss! Hey Asa!
