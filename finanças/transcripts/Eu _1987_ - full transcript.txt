I woke up feeling bad again. I've been waking up like this for a long time, without joy. Yeah, I think from now on it will always be like this Even nights with good dreams end like this with these mornings. Something needs to happen. It's not impossible that nothing else will happen in my life, in what I have left of my life. What's going on Marcelo? Nothing. I felt like getting up. At this time? Go back to bed Lila. Now it's no use. Once I wake up, I can't sleep anymore. What is it? Did something happen? You can leave it there. I am starving. I'll get it ready. But like that, huh? All! - Absolutely. - OK. Why did you get up early? What happened? Doctor Marcelo woke feeling bad again. Again? What was it this time? Pour water for me. I already know. You've been dreaming about someone. Tell me... ...with whom? I dreamed about my daughter. Berenice. And made you like this? Also, with so many pictures of her around the house? I think even I will dream. Tell the dream, tell. It was time when she was still a child when we spent the holidays at our house, on the beach. How romantic! She was eight or nine years old. And what were you doing? Is it the house we go to? That one? Yeah, there hasn't been another one since my grandfather's time. He discovered it shortly after he arrived from Italy. It's like an island. And it's not? I thought it was. It's a peninsula, but no one can get there. And I bought miles and miles of land to isolate our house. Not even with a war tank would these picnickers get there. And if someone goes to sea, my recommendation, people have express orders to shoot, light them up. Why did you never want to take us there? I do not know why. Sometimes I like to be there alone, thinking... remembering... Look! Ten, twelve. How is Marcelo? Are we going to Castro's party? At Le Panache? Or are you ashamed to go with us? It depends, if we want to go to the beach tomorrow morning, we won't be able to. These parties go on until late. No one can handle it. We can handle it! I don't think you want to get there with us. Me too. You can rest easy, Marcelo, we'll let you roam free. I just need to stop by the house and pick up a dress Come here Marcelo, speak the truth, speak. You don't want to be seen with the two of us again. You're scared of what they're going to say, aren't you? Having sex with both of them and seriously? Taking them to your house, Marcelo? Two sluts! You don't get rid of them anymore, don't you get with anyone else, Marcelo? Yeah, you're getting a reputation for being a pervert. And old too. And losing that of conqueror. The irresistible. Old man. Have him call me urgently as soon as he arrives. Okay Joana, I'll stop by later. OK thanks. Why does she leave her clothes here? Does she come often? Came. Now it's been a while since she came. She didn't show up anymore. Well, doesn't she live with her mother in Rio? Not there. Theoretically, yes. But no one ever knows where she is. Never, not even her mother, doesn't stop traveling. Rich life is something else She is beautiful? Intelligent? Also, she speaks five languages. Posh? Sure. And is she hot? In short, the woman of her life. It's a good thing the little girl only appears in dreams because otherwise we'd be out. Marcelo, if your daughter doesn't show up anymore... You can adopt me and Renata. We also like daddy's lap. I'll be gone ten days, I'll trust you. It is on these occasions that the most interesting opportunities arise. It is true. So, no shyness. In short, We will continue with our aggressive policy. In principle. We want it all. - You can rest easy. - Leave it to us. - Happy holidays, then, Marcelo - Have a good time. - Happy Holidays. - Take care. Well, Doctor Marcelo. It was all written down, didn't we forget anything? I think so, but if you want, we can revise. Don't forget to have the three paintings I bought from the Lambert Gallery removed. And if Shirokawa's painter shows up, give him whatever money he needs. That's right. Ah, I called Rio and spoke to your... - With your daughter's mother. - I know, so what? And she hasn't heard from Dona Berenice for over a month either. You keep calling. Any news from my daughter, please let me know immediately. Besides that, I don't want to be bothered under any circumstances. I understood. Excuse me, then, Dr. Marcelo. Joanna? May I help? Did you like the gift? Beautiful! Thank you, Dr. Marcelo! Where are you going to spend the holidays? Right here. With my boyfriend. Merry Christmas then. For the you too. Liked? Uhm. See what beautiful models are the latest releases. That pink looks so pretty on you. - Oh this is mine! - Oh that's your style! But this white blouse is mine. Can we take it all? Put it on the account. I'm not the one paying. Oh, I can see you, huh. We'll take it all. Can we? You can take whatever they want. It's a Christmas present. So we're going to choose other things more. Sure thing. Oh, she is so fancy. Oh, look at his face. Oh, what a pose! Hey, how's it going? Hello, how are you? All is well? Hi Marcelo. - Are we going to stay here? - Yeah, out here. At that table. We're going to stay hidden. It's absurd. We come to a party and stay out here. And no one will see us. Later we'll go inside. Hi Marcelo, how are you? Hi Gere. My friends Lila and Renata. Geremiah. Did you receive the invitation to my New Year's Eve? I got it, but I won't go. But you've got to be an amazing thing. Better than last year. Yeah, it turns out I won't be here. I will travel soon. You don't know what you're going to miss. - I invited the best. - I suppose. You are invited too. It is clear. They go with me. Well, we're going for a little walk, come on. Excuse me. I find these two tremendously exciting. I think so too. Listen here, how is business with you? Stop being nosy, Geremias. What you want to know? No, no. Anything. You invented an interesting thing. Interesting. They must have something. Some... Do you want to know if it's good? It's very good. They are great. Hi cutie! Where are you going? We're taking a walk around there. I think I know you from somewhere, don't you? I don't know. You know? It doesn't matter, I wanted to invite you to my New Year's Eve. You can call anytime. It's cool, thanks See you later, call me. Ada. Alone, Marcelo? How is it possible? I missed you Ada. Is not true. Yes it is true. It was worth coming to this boring party. I didn't even want to come. I'm going to travel to the beach in a little while. Remember? How long, isn't it? What happened to us, Ada... Ah well, I know it was my fault, these things happen. I just don't know how I could let it happen to you. Lose you. Let's get out of here, Ada. Let's get out of here now, the two of us Let's travel anywhere, wherever you want. We will... ...to that place in the mountains. Itatiaia, remember? But didn't you just say you were going to the beach, Marcelo? It depends on you, if you want. We get out of here now and go to any... We took too long, didn't we? Mr. Giovane is insisting that we spend New Year's Eve at his house. But I already told him we're going to the beach with you. Hi Giovanni. Well, I... Good night Marcelo, they are waiting for me. Excuse me. Goodbye. Goodbye! Who is it? Beautiful... Beautiful, fine, rich. - Smart - And classy! Things are against me today. You have a whole year to go to the beach, Marcelo. And my party only happens once every ten years. I'm not going anywhere, Giovanni Much less to your party. I don't think I know what that's going to be. An old people's home celebrating approaching death. A wax museum or a trap to catch little girls and see if the annual fuck of the oldies comes out. What's the deal, Marcelo? Who sees him thinks he is a schoolboy entering adolescence. In fact, the one who should throw a big party was you. He made a fortune from that oxen. It deserved a celebration, didn't it? I will celebrate. My way. I am individualist, I play alone. A mountain of money, huh. You can still make money in this country. For a while. For those who are competent, it does. Is this a praise? Or are you trying to please me to go to your little party? But it would be a pleasure, right? But I want you to take these two cuties. I knew, I know you, Giovanni. But if they want to, they can go. Why don't you go? If you want, you can go. Decide! Don't you want to go? Hey, come on, huh? Now on top of us, eh? What gave you? Are you nervous? Never mind, I'll go, Marcelo. You decide later. Bye, huh. Do you want to to leave, Marcelo? Do we really have to travel? Perhaps he has given up. You know her? Sure. How did Werner get such a thing? She's with Werner, isn't she? She might be... ...may not be. What do you mean by that? Nobody really knows where she came from. I also heard that she is glazed in รณ... l'argent. She's a little moody too. According to Pradinho, she is a little crazy. Do you want? If you promise you won't fight anymore and you'll be nice, I'll find a way to get it for us. What is it? We are all already... Calm down Lila! We have to get the boy out of the pit before he gets worse. I can go? You know. Can I or can't I? See if she wants to come spend Christmas with us on the beach. By then, she must have been invited to over 50 holiday parties. We will see. Why did you do that, Marcelo? I thought we were going to be so good there. The three of us, peaceful, sunbathing in a good way. But even if she goes, it will be the same, It's just to cheer up, to warm up a little. We're going to have a Christmas dinner like that! And on New Year's we're going to get a monumental high! Inside the water! But it's only until the second, after that I won't let you take another sip. None. Again these songs? You can't put anything else on it, can you? Leave it. He won't change at all. But who has to listen is us, isn't it the darling? Marcelo, can't you put on a rock? Take it. Ah, leave it for the second, take it. Don't drink, don't eat. Do not smoke. Fitness. Damn doctor. I wonder if he... ...forbade you the rest too? And you know what? I think you're sick of both of us. And if you are, just say so because we'll get out of there real quick. Oh, don't start over, Renata. That's not it. No, that's it. Everyone knows you're a super fickle guy. It's not me who's fickle. People are... insufficient. Have you had enough of us, Marcelo? That's it? That's it, yes. I'm feeling it. It's nothing to you. I'm half full. Of everything. Well, I think the insufficient ones should go away, don't you? Let him. He's in trouble. Marcelo. I know very well how you are feeling about your daughter. This daughter again? Enough, right? Since morning with this story... I want to confess something. All my life I had a passion for my father. I was afraid to even think about it. I thought it was a sin. But I was crazy about him. I dreamed all the time that I was with him. But I never had the courage for anything. I trembled with fear just to get close to him When my mother died, we lived together for a while. It was so hard. I wanted. So much. Then I left home. Soon after my father got very sick and I went to take care of him in the hospital. Only then could I get closer to him, day and night, together. But shortly thereafter, my father died. And I was the one who had to wash and dress my father. Why is she telling me this? For the first time in my life, I was able to touch his body. And felt the whole body. My father was such a handsome man! I washed his body, I touched everything! All. Do you want to stop this freshness? You're getting neurotic again, are you? It's just that I realized that Marcelo is attached to his daughter. I noticed that from the first time he spoke of her. Oh, maybe she's like me, like almost all daughters, crazy about legal incest. I would have gone to bed with my father. That moralism out there didn't let me. Did you see? You have just taken a free class. Yeah, if her father didn't die, she would marry him soon, soon, and the world would be free of one more slut. You're kidding, but he got it right. Did you really understand, Marcelo? You guys didn't understand anything. The whole thing is on another plane. The grand plane! Ah, what a plane, Marcelo! You are always wanting the same thing. And what is our plane then? The low plane? We are rice and beans. And your daughter is wonderful caviar, she is the nectar of the gods. But he likes rice and beans, say that you like it. I am an animal. I want to devour everything, everything. I don't want to leave anything to anyone. That's all I care about. I prefer it that way, when you're cynical, mocking. The other day I was told that... ...you use us. But I like. Take. Take. Lila. Even or odd? - Odd. - Even. One two Three and go! How did you get all this? Land grabbing? When my grandfather bought this, this house was a ruin, falling apart. Then he touch it up. My father made it better and I turned it into what is now. Our family denies that rich father, noble son, poor grandson tradition. In our hands, everything has multiplied. And how, huh? Competence my daughter, hereditary competence, and in addition to competence, we always had another very strong trait. A great voracity, an appetite! We cannot see a beautiful woman. My grandfather had a motto. He said "Io se no chiavo, no me diverto" The old man was a demolishing beast, he couldn't see a girl, he had everyone. My father, was calmer, calmer, but I didn't put the family tradition to shame. And you? Ah, I follow the family motto to the letter. If I don't have a good fuck, "I don't have fun." The only thing that's worth it it makes us feel that we exist, it makes us forget the mediocrity of everything. Hello. Hi Juliana, you around here? Mom got sick, I didn't want to bother you. She asked me to take her place for a while. I thought you were traveling. And I was. I came back. I'm going to stay a while this time. Until after Christmas. I know and they warned us. Where should I put the girls? In the big room, I think. Berenice's room? Yeah, it's fine. So, excuse me. What am I doing here? Very chic. The dressing room is next door. Come. The dressing room. The bathroom is the first door on the left. Excuse me. Full of pose this woman. Who does she think she is? She didn't like us, no. It looks like she owns the house. Look. Look that. What a beauty. It must be his daughter's too. This woman leaves her mark everywhere. It's to leave Marcelo on edge, on a leash. Juliana, check out the list I'm giving Chico of the things I want for Christmas dinner. I want a supper with everything. What he finds in the city you have the office staff arrange in Sรฃo Paulo. OK. I will check. How are you, Chico? All right, all in order. You can send Eugenio to collect the boat. Tomorrow, if I want to leave, I'll tell you. Alright. Oh, it's true, Juliana, we're going to have one more guest for Christmas dinner. Chico will have to pick her up on the other side on Wednesday. What time, really? Around two. But she will call. Around two. You'll recognize right away, she's a very pretty girl, very tall, very charming, very pretty. Oh, what a delight! Damn. No, not now. I don't like these demonstrations anymore, no. Not now. I want comfort. I want comfort. Good Morning! Good Morning! I'm Beatriz. And I'm Marcelo. I know. Dad! Daughter! Oh, good, daughter! Berenice. Berenice Come Beatriz. - Lets go in. - Thanks. Why you didn't tell me you were coming? I wanted to surprise you, Dad. So without warning, just the way I like it I told Beatriz he's going to be astonished, It's the last thing he should be expecting. I don't show up that long, don't I. And why so long, daughter? You know me, Dad, I waited until I felt like it. Then it started to make me miss, a longing. I couldn't resist and came. We arrived yesterday in Sรฃo Paulo, I stopped by your office to get money, I was told you had come down to spend New Year's, Christmas here. So I couldn't resist that opportunity. Christmas with daddy. Oh daddy. So good to see you. Despite the issues, I miss you so much, I confess, I was dying to come. I wanted to show Beatriz our place, and show Beatriz to you. She is the sweetest and most perfect person I have ever met. And the most serious and the smartest too, you'll see. She's my guru, right? I brought you a bunch of presents, Daddy. Later you will see. I do not know if you will like it. Where do I put my bags, Dr. Marcelo? In my room, in my room, of course. These here, are two friends of mine, Renata and Lila. How are you? This is my daughter, Berenice, her friend, Beatriz. Berenice came to spend Christmas with me and Beatriz too. Well, excuse me. Dad, sorry, I didn't know. No, but they're just passing through. They leave today or tomorrow. They were in my room, right? They're leaving. They are actually very cute. Yeah. We're going to change your rooms. Did you see? We're out. No, another room is very good too. Oh, I know. Anyway, you didn't use the room at all. Excuse me. Dad, aren't you going to send these girls away because of us? No, no. They are leaving. Lie. I know very well why they are here. I'm sure they weren't going away. Don't start with moralism with me, Dad. I understand very well. I understand everything, I'm not scandalized because I found you here with the duo, no. I'd be a lot more pissed off if I got here, found you with a real, stuck-up girlfriend, wanting to marry you. You are in love, smitten with her. Then yes, I would even be jealous. And you know, Dad, I found these girls... curious, different. I don't understand exactly what they are, but I think it would be really nice to be able to live with them for a few days, study them, observe them so closely. Does not make any sense. You don't see that you guys. You don't match. Don't match! Daddy, what do you mean? Beatriz, we don't agree with them. This is really good, dad You didn't understand me. - Isn't that what I meant? - I understood. Yes, I got it. Only I'm not going to let you be classist and prejudice and send them away from here. He won't do that to the girls. You must be having fun with this comedy, no. Dad, Beatriz is a great psychologist. Oh yeah? No, not yet. She sure is. And she's guiding me now, far better than any college professor I've ever had. Now I'm taking it seriously, okay? I want to become like her. Are these two... Dr. Marcelo? The girls want to talk to you. Excuse me? Behave, huh? Berenice? Your room is ready! Thank you, Juliana. You're sweet! Her mother has worked here since my grandfather's time. She was gone, but now, apparently, she's back to stay. People who come in here don't seem to want to leave. You knew she was coming. You wanted to use us as a provocation. Oh, you're crazy. I had no idea. If I knew not, I would bring... You wanted her to see you like this, cool, surrounded, to play the macho who has everything. But now it's okay. You can stay normally. Normally? From the kitchen to here! I think they are prettier than us. Stop it. They are full of money, yes. Only that. You shouldn't have done this to us, Marcelo. You always do what you want, even with us around. But this is humiliation. You are irritating me. And don't forget you called that one over there, Venus, from that disgusting Werner She was going to drop a lot to come here. Well done. He thinks she is queen of Greece. You need to find a way to warn her not to come. It will look bad. Now is? Oh yes? Now three is too much. It's going to ruin everything, isn't it? No way! You deal with it. Besides, I don't even know where she is now and I won't look bad because of you. Nobody told you to. I need to get rid of these two. Can I? Hi daughter! - Hey. - Hey. Excuse me? I just came to spend a few days with dad. And I would love for you to stay too. After all, this house is so big, right? Too big even. I would prefer it to be something smaller, like those beach houses, but this whole megalomaniac family has delusions of grandeur. We'll be able to have a nice Christmas. Right, dad? Of course, I already told them that. Juliana, Can I? If it works... The cables are undersea and are always breaking, but this one must be working. Yes sir, huh. You were right. Friendly, charming, hot. I noticed that you liked your friend a lot. Beautiful. Yeah, must be a good fuck too. Despite the angel face. But you're not going to mess with them, not with them, okay? By the looks of it, we won't be of any use here anymore. Even with all the meds you take, you won't be able to handle everything. And we're going to be silly here. But what nonsense! It's nothing like that, no. And we're going to give you the expense for nothing. Now, if you want, we can help make her head to what you want. She looks like she likes a perversion. Stop it. Oh, and there's more! From what I've observed, I think they've been fucking each other for some time. You will end up on a mess. Soon, soon. We will avenge this. We'll burn you out for three days! Let's end the party! I told you to stop! You know, dad? Beatriz is a great personality test specialist and now she's going to write a book about it. She knows all kinds of tests, from the oldest to the most modern, and she is developing new things too. She masters all the techniques, doesn't she Beatriz? It's a fascinating study, Dad. And I want to dedicate myself to that too. I want, by the way, that she do some tests with you. With me for what? I always thought you needed something like that to understand yourself better, to find your place in life. That's right. After all, are the tests that good, Beatriz? They are, they are very good. But I think Berenice is exaggerating a little bit. At least as far as I'm concerned. I... I'm starting now. So much so that I'm just writing a thesis, not a book. Who really understands the subject is a teacher of mine. This teacher is the really smart, super, super. Yeah. He's really good, really good. He is doing new, revolutionary work in Europe. That's why he's there at the seminary. I will meet him later. No, you won't. I do not want you to go. Sorry. What is the purpose of this for real? For real? To help people. Help? In what way? To earn a living? Also. I doubt. They did this to me once. They put a bunch of pictures in front of me so I could guess if it was a dinosaur, an elephant. If I were to base it on that, I wouldn't be of any use to anything else. I would end up begging on the street. And she, she... she was going to end up in a clinic for the retarded. Maybe you're right. I already understand myself very well. Unfortunately. There are six games of eight photos, 48 faces in all, people of the most varied types and professional activities. With one detail: all sick. You will now choose the two you like the most. And the two you dislike the most. This is the first phase of the test. Let's see what your preferences are. He always forces others to listen to the music he wants. There's no way. How long have you known my father? About three months or so. Got used to it. But he treats you well, doesn't he? Well, it depends. He treats you very well, yes. You know, I don't know what you're thinking, but we like him a lot. People cannot understand, they are jealous. They think it's all just... But that's not all, no. You chose three criminals, a priest, sexual pervert, two common spies, an irreversible schizophrenic, a military man, commander of an extermination camp, responsible for millions and millions of deaths... and one hysterical. And on top of that it was unrecoverable. Yeah, but what does that all mean? Nothing. We didn't do it seriously. You know, this is a very old and famous test. It was created by a Hungarian psychoanalyst named Szondi. Carefully done, it can form very important data of human personality. Any day we do it for real. But do you really want to know something about me? I confess I was curious. Why? Because of everything... and nothing in particular. What you want to know? I tell you myself, no need for testing. Then speak. What are the things that really interest you? My stuff. Myself in my world. I want to isolate myself more and I don't want to know anything else, let alone collective problems unsolvable. Unsolvable? Yeah. Everything became unsolvable. You can only solve it yourself. Look, I only believe in people, in people who do things, individuals. The world has become a horror, irreversible, everywhere. Ended. It's over. Are you sure? But it wasn't my fault. Your father talks about you all the time. I think about him a lot lately too. Before, until very recently, I had a lot of issues with him because of my mother. She was very fond of him. She lived for him, for him. She suffered a lot with the separation, but now it's the other way around. I feel like I'm kind of like him. Either I want everything, or I want nothing. More and more I understand Dad. This madness of his. No, I don't like politics, the way it's done, it's something for little people. Second class activity for opportunists and incompetents. And the worst is that they screw us with this incompetence. Yeah, and the competent ones... Because it's no use, no use for nothing. Look, I don't know yet how long it will take, but the hordes are coming. They'll take care of everything. It will be the final leveling down. And the world will become an impossible place. Impossible for what? For anything. For everything. Good thing I'm not young anymore. For a few years... ...maybe it still will work. And if not? Patience. So it means that for me, for Berenice it won't work. You adapt. For me, no way. I can't, I'm not interested in anything. I want to live only for my feelings, my senses, sensations, emotions, a physical present, sensual. Enough now. I don't want to shock you. Shock me? Nothing shocks me. Never. I just try to understand. So understand me. Now. Right now, my only interest in the world is you. It's no use. He won't come. You'll see, I know him. Alone he won't be. I do not know. Don't worry that rabbits don't come out of that bush anytime soon. Sneaking in? Did you miss us? I was pissed, but now I'm even enjoying this mess. I just want to see how you do, you slut. That other one saved you. Providential. Are you enjoying her that much? Who do you like best? The two of them. It is us? Also. Both, always. Cynical. Mr. Marcelo, it's as you want, huh? Your little girl is your great love, is not? Only in imagination. With the other, he will make the great romance of his life. And the lust is all we'll have. I don't want it like this. This one has nothing to do with it. You're serious, Marcelo, and that's not the combination. Seriously, no. Did you warn the girl? I shouldn't have, but I called and it didn't help. Nobody picked up at the number she gave me. You have to find a way. That way? It doesn't matter, deal with it, I don't want her here. What difference will one more make? Marcelo, come here. You are my father. I am your daughter. Let's imagine? Believe. Hi daughter. - Good morning - So, did you sleep well? Very well. She attracts you, right? Yeah, I think so, but nothing too important, no. It's not true, Dad, you're completely into her, fascinated. Everyone notices. But much more fascinated by you. You know you're my only crush don't you? The only true passion. Look dad, I don't think it's good for you to be like this with Beatriz, no. Like this? So, like that, in love. And look, it's not because of age, no, that I don't care about that. Incidentally, older men are much more interesting and you know it, that's not why, no. And why not? I just know. Daughter, listen. Don't be angry Is there something between you two? No dad, don't worry. None of us are into it, not even a little bit. I just wanted to tell you that... this can make you upset. Although I find it difficult for Beatriz to be interested, I know her well. Not because of you I know you seduce even the devil, I know you too, but with her it won't work. She's still very involved with her boyfriend, that Hungarian professor she talked about. They fought and she's just traveling with me to see if she relieves herself. Nothing like you thought, no, okay? She is waiting for him to call her house in Rio. He will call. I'm sure. He always calls. Then she runs away, drops everything. They love each other, father, really. And you? Are you in love with someone? Why do you want to know if it's my thing? Curiosity. No, I'm not. I'm tired of boring people, without strength. I don't like to talk about it, no. Well dad, let me go, Beatriz is waiting for me. Don't forget what I said. Both, like this, both. Forever. It would be perfection. Paradise, Paradise. No, not this one. Buy it. Yeah. Buy everything. Buy, buy for real. Buy it! Yeah, and have an investigation done on those people. Depending, I'll give them a scare. OK. Yeah, and I'll talk with you later, Queiroz. Hi Beatriz. It is working now? Yes. It's just like that, it comes and goes, but they're making sure it doesn't happen again. Anything we use the radio. Can I? Sure. Of course. Excuse me. So, nothing? Not a message? There are always people there, aren't there? Look, don't leave the house alone. If you can't call me, send me a telegram. Anyway, I'll give you a code from here. Take paper and pencil. I got it, there. Hold the bait well on the hook. Now throw. Like that! Lock the reel. It takes patience. Calm calm. I'm sorry for yesterday. For what? My conversation, I was trying to make an impression, kind of... Superman's Vacation Confessions. I realized right away... I'm actually bad insecure, looking for compensation for the inevitable. Which one? There are so many. Mine. The old age. The death. Help me, help me! Don't let go. How big, Chico! I always had veneration, adoration for Berenice, from childhood, since always. When I separated from her mother, she got too far away from me. I saw very little of her and each time she came back, came back different and that, too, was changing within me. What? That! This feeling, this love I felt. Tell me about it. After great resistance, moralisms, modesty, those things that are left in us, despite everything, I... Yes. I began to come to the conclusion that what I felt for her was not merely a love... paternal. I was in love with my daughter. And why didn't you tell her that? These things are also talked about. I wouldn't have the courage, I never will. And why are you saying all this to me? I wanted to tell you yesterday, when you arrived the exact moment you turned to me, it happened. No, better not. Dad, Dad. Dad. Dad? Have you ever noticed that these maids treat us differently than they? Don't bother. Are you sure about that? Sure. Since we arrived. Juliana, you make arrangements, I don't want that here. Yes sir. And? How do they do this? They have a naughty way of doing it. They must think we're... I don't know. Just by the way they look, they try to make us feel inferior. I barely care. They always end up having to serve anyway. Leave it alone. It shouldn't be nice either, serving others, washing, cleaning. Not for me! This fish is really good. Yes it is. A delight, daughter, congratulations. I just fished, who prepared it was Chico. Is he married? No, but once was. Is he a widower? He is, more or less. Tell the story right, Dad. Chico is disillusioned. I remember his wife, a long time ago, but I remember. She ran away. Because? I don't know. I don't think anyone knows. She ran away. Ran away. After that, he didn't want to hear from anyone else. Loves her to this day only her. Yeah, he was kind of obsessed. That's not it, Dad. He liked her, loved her. There was no one else for him. He just wanted to know about her. She disappeared and he preferred it that way, it's her or nothing Can you understand? But cooking like this, he could have as many women as he wanted, no problem, grabbing by the stomach. Poor girl. She is so upset. She likes him too. Too? Listen, you're not taking this story seriously, are you? You know what Marcelo is. You know what we are. - You know everything, don't you? - I know what? I can be whatever, but I like him. Look here! You're not going to be talking nonsense now, okay? You know very well... that we've been having a good time for awhile, but for a short time. It could be until tomorrow. Beatriz. I need to go. Don't go. And Berenice? Forget it. - Is this Marcelo's house? - Yes Ah cool. Please help me with my bags? - Oh, how are you? - It's all right. Bye, cutie! Kiss! Goodbye! Goodbye! Kiss! Hi, I'm Diana. Good Morning! I said I was coming tomorrow. I was on a beach nearby, with some guys, you know? But then there was some issues, and they sent me on that thing. Are you Renata's friend? I don't know you... Not me... I am Marcelo's daughter. Daughter? Diana! Hi Renata! Come up! Girls, what happened? The guy's daughter here with you? Calm down, everything is under control. You know, I had to throw a tantrum there. The biggest scandal. The guys were slackers. Then they were scared to death of me, and to get rid of it, they got this helicopter. I didn't want to stay there another minute and they didn't they want me too. I was going to break everything. Nice here, right? I imagined something else. Very good. I don't know why Dad hasn't woken up yet. He must have slept badly, as usual. Another daughter? You were sleeping so well that I didn't woke you up to go to the beach. Yeah, slept a lot. What is he wanting? Build a harem? Who knows? Come have breakfast with us, a friend of Dad's has arrived. I'm going. I want to see his face! Hey! Hello. Excuse me. There were some unforeseen events, but that's ok, feel free. It's your house. Oh, you can, I get used to anywhere. Oh, it's beautiful here. Really beautiful. What a shame! Look, excuse me, but I have to look at some papers. You do as you please. Renata and Lila help the girl in everything she wants. Excuse me I didn't understand anything. What did I come here to do? Why did you invite me? With so many beautiful women Then I think this old man cannot handle everything. Is he having sex with his daughter too? Perhaps. No it's not. He is in love with the other. And what are you here for? Babysitting? Also. Look how beautiful! I had to pull these things out of the kitchen by force. Those cuckolds of these maids always play hot when they shouldn't. Oh, I hope they don't mess with me, no. I beat people up. I'm hate a stuck-up maid. Here. Did you see the manner of that housekeeper? That Juliana. She must have a knack for it. I think Marcelo has already been fucking her. Or else he fucked her mother! Maybe she is his daughter. Yeah, that must be it. She's his daughter and he's been fucking her too. That's why he can't scold or send away. On top of everything, he's crazy about a little girl, isn't he? Now it's very likely that his father fucked Juliana's mother. And she is his sister. And he's eating his little sister. It was him who fucked Chico's wife, see? That's why she left. And his mother? Did he fuck her too? Probably. You know, I've had several jobs, but I couldn't afford to eat. I'm not made for this. Then I discovered my great quality. This face and this body. You know, it's crazy, but there are assholes who pay whatever I want to have a woman like me. Yeah, because we have to take it while we can. Because it never lasts long. We are disposable. Public utility service... We are a public utility. Social justice! They have to pay us. I'm going to be a rich old woman! Marcelo is not like that. When he wants, he doesn't have to pay. The darling is not what it says. And if he doesn't need it, then soon he will. Tell me, Chico, was he always like this? Sometimes I remember him as a different person. Wonderful. I think I've been very unfair to my mother lately. It really must be impossible to be married to such a person. She never came here again, did she? No. The last time was... about nine years ago. And she said she wasn't coming back. I don't think I'll be coming back either. Why does he have to be like this? Prove it, it's delicious. Fine. Thanks! This is delicious, it's really good. Didn't I tell you? Thank you, daughter. Do you want? Oh I want. Dona Beatriz, phone for you. Thanks. Calm. Something wrong? No. I'm sorry about this girl, is a joke, from Ada for Beatriz. I want you to stay with me today. Why? Berenice. I wait for you tonight in my room. Will you come? Lay there. You're totally irresponsible, you're always up to some shit. Look, open your mouth, take it. Are you liking my dad? No. But he's in love with you. No. Neither. But I saw you. I know. So I don't understand. One day I'll explain, okay? What was it? I'm leaving. It worked out? Did he call? I knew it. Let's let her sleep. Hi Marcelo. Did they leave you alone? What time is it? It's late. Past two. Listen here, you need to put your guest to work. She's pissed. Did she come here for nothing? That is wrong. But I'll pay, no problem. No, that's not it. She is feeling humiliated. She is not understanding anything Also, with all the trouble around. Yeah. It's just that she thinks she's the greatest wonder in the world. Will you enter or not? You're going to stand there like a slob, are you? Come and close that door! Hey, come here! Better to leave it for another time. No, look here, what are you thinking? That I'm a clown? Since I arrived, you've been winding me up. You think I'm silly, do you? Speak quietly! Speak low is the fuck! Look here I say what I want. I'm the best here, okay? And I didn't come here for this fag to snub me. OK! You shit! Get that crazy girl out of here! Go fuck yourself! Out of here! See how much money she wants and get out of here! Calm calm! What was your grandfather's motto anyway? You better go too. See you in Sรฃo Paulo. Didn't even have to ask. Yeah, but I don't want to go anyway, no. I just want to go the way I came. Do as she wants. Order it at the office. At least I'll spend Christmas with my mother, very nice, eating that chicken noodles. Let's go. Come, let's go. Get in there, bitch. Let's go! Hi daughter! Hi Dad. They left, didn't they? Did you have any problems? Not. Renata organized everything perfectly. She is great. You should use her as a secretary. Yeah, I guess I was kind of rude, didn't I? But later I'll fix it. Beatriz went too. What? That's what I'm telling you, she left too. Very early. But why? She wanted to go. Dad, I warned you. Only you misunderstood me. I just wanted to spare you. I think you were a little naive. Childish. You overestimated yourself. But what happened anyway? The Hungarian, the professor, that one. He sent a ticket to her mother's house. He must be waiting for her in Rome. I knew it was going to happen. It was just a little fight. They like each other too much. She never resists when he calls. But then why? You two? She is like this. For all her seriousness, she's kind of unpredictable. If the professor had taken another week to call. Maybe even she slept with you... ...for a few days. For her, I wouldn't mean anything, just an extra pleasure. She wouldn't be afraid to get involved. Now, she might also have been curious to try you on, know if you really are... Really... After all her confessions on that test. But there wasn't enough time. Father, with all your experience, you have not yet been able to understand a certain type of woman, especially those who have personality and for whom these things of love and sex have another meaning. Seems like you still make a difference between women like this, like that. The ones that are for everything, the serious ones, the romantic ones, the sluts, the familial. See if you make a really nice arrangement. OK. I can imagine the things you must be thinking about me. In addition to what you've already told me. What I think it has nothing to do. I just wanted to see you relaxed. I know you're looking, searching, but this anguish of yours sometimes afflicts me a little. I wanted to see you come up with something. Wait for me to die then. But before that, what do you hope to get? What are you waiting for, father? I'm not expecting anything. I'm wanting to recover that. That feeling that throws you up, that makes you go up. And you feel strong, alive, vibrating there, in that moment, not caring if it will end or not. Do you feel free like the wind, like an animal, teeth craving something. And have you always had this? Coming and going. But lately, more going. That is, running away. And what do you need for that? Women, you had almost everyone you wanted. You know you still can. Sometimes it even frightens with this voracity. Yeah, but there's always something missing. On whose part? For my part, of course. You should know. I have a troglodyte inside of me, a wild, ferocious, aggressive animal that always wants more and more and always waits for something and doesn't conform to frustrations. The limitations of any relationship. Something has to happen. Oh, I was sure you were coming. I even won a bet from Giovanni. It doesn't boast much, no. Otherwise I'm leaving. Have you met my daughter, Berenice? Remember her? Your daughter? You are kidding? - Pleasure. - It's my pleasure. I'm glad to have you here. The house is yours. This time you over did it, Marcelo. Such a daughter! Even in that you are lucky. Hello. How are you? Well thanks. And how are you too? Best wishes to you! Hi Marcelinho, good to see you! Oh, you don't say anything, that's your daughter, isn't it? Wow, but she looks just like Ana. There's no difference. It's just like her. And you're still handsome, aren't you? Your father is an ingrate. He never remembers his old friends. He only thinks about... Take care of him, see. This song is the only thing I have in common with Geremias. Hi Armando. Are you ok Marcello? Look over there. His daughter? Everyone's looking at us, Dad. Did I not tell you? If they only knew... Why didn't we stay on the beach? It was so good. They need me at the office on the second, in the morning. I already know what it was. You thought the employees were noticing, didn't you? Did they? Ah father, I want to travel soon, as you promised so I can be alone with you without needing to disguise. First London and then Madrid, Paris, Greece. But I don't want to go to Rome, no. Suddenly, we find Beatriz and I don't want you to fall in love with her again, nor by anyone. I shouldn't talk about Beatriz like that, after all, it was she who brought us together. She wanted this for me. She was our messenger. Look who's there, Dad. Look over there. Marcelissimo! Happy new year! I gave up on my party, I can't compete with Geremias, but I won! Look that! You were right, they are really cute! I like them. I hope they are fine. Marcelo. Nobody believes she is your daughter. I'll take it for them to see. Don't worry, no one will steal her. Let's go. You wait for me here. Okay, it's delivered. And let's go. High spirits! It's almost striking midnight. I think they still have doubts. Better for us. Dad. Year one. And now?
