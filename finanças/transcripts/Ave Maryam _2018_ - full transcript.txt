MITRA SEPUH CONVENT, SEMARANG 1980 Hey, Dinda. I'll buy four bottles of milk today. Can you deliver one to Father Martin at church? Here's the money. Thank you, Sister. My dear brothers and sisters, let us confess our sins before God so that we are worthy to celebrate the salvation God has given to us. -I confess... -I confess... -...to the almighty God... -...to the almighty God... -...and to everyone present... -...and to everyone present... -...that I have sinned... -...that I have sinned... -...in thought, word... -...in thought, word... -...and deed, and through negligence. -...and deed, and through negligence. -I have sinned. -I have sinned. -I have sinned. -I have sinned. -I truly have sinned. -I truly have sinned. -Therefore I ask the Blessed Virgin... -Therefore I ask... -...the Blessed Virgin Mary... -...the angels and all the saints... This is Father Yosef. -This is Sister Mila. -Yes. -I'm Mila. -Yosef. This is Sister Rebecca. -I'm Rebecca. -Yosef. -Towel for you, Father. -Thank you. And this is Sister Maryam. -Thank you. I'm Yosef. -I'm Maryam. -And this is Sister Moniq, everyone. -Good evening, Sister. Good evening. -Excuse me, where can I get changed? -This way. Thank you, Sister Rebecca. Father Yosef is going to be around until Christmas. He will help with the orchestra. He's excellent. Nothing's changed. It's good to be back in my hometown. You were born here? It's late. I'll see you all tomorrow at Mass, okay? Come, Father. -Good night. -Good night, Sister. Good night. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Almighty God, we thank you for this feast that you have provided us, a symbol of your goodness upon us. Bless this food so that it will bring us good health. And bless those who have prepared it. Bless us who gather here to share this feast. We say this prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, now and forever. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. It's normal if they sometimes forget. One day it will happen to us, too. Don't let it get to you. Sister Maryam, have you seen Sister Moniq? Yesterday, somebody offered Pak Rahmat to take part in a protest. He would get a sarong and cap and be paid 300,000 rupiah. But he said no. Alhamdulillah. When I'm finished with this, could you take Father Martin his lunch? How about for the handsome new Father, too? She's right. We have Father Yosef, too, now. You're right, I'll get it ready. Please wait. Here. You need a hand? Let's just put it here, it will be easier for you to carry. Thank you. Don't forget Father Martin's lunch. Take care. -Bye, Sisters! -Bye, Dinda! My dear Sisters, we have come to the end of the Eucharist. Thanks be to God. Let us go forth into the world in peace. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Sister, how is Sister Moniq feeling now that she's back home? Is everything okay? If you have any problems, just ask Father Yosef. He's the one who knows how to talk to Sister Moniq. -I will, Father. Thank you. -You're welcome. Come on, Sister! Come on, Sister! Come on! Come on, watch out. Sister. -Are you going back to the dormitory? -I am. So am I. Let's stop at the bakery. I'll take you to the dormitory afterwards. Let's go. Could you take me to my room? I think I'll call it a night. You're still here, Father? Would you like to take a walk for a little while? I'll see you tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. Good night. Sister Maryam, Sister Moniq has a high fever. -Good morning, Sister. -Morning, Father. Sister. Let me take it from here. Good morning, Sister. That's it. When you fear death, you give your life the value it deserves. Happiness becomes the most important thing when it comes to enjoying all the beautiful things in the world. But everything comes in its own portion, Father. -Sister. -I'm going out to buy a book. How much is this? Which one? That will be 32,000 rupiah, Sister. -Here you go. -Thank you, Sister. -Thank you. -You're welcome. How can I help you, Father? I'd like to take you out to find rain in the middle of summer. It's late, Father. Excuse me. THE LOVE OF GOD Day by day, he grew into a strapping young man. Until one day he decided that he wanted to become a priest. And to him, if we cannot change it, then we should make it different from the first time we saw it. -Father. -Yes? I came across a story about a nun who found a baby boy and cared for him. Yes, and now she's finally home. She used to do what you do. Attending to the older sisters, taking care of them, until their very last days. But then she left because she realized she would one day become one of them. But why is she always silent, Father? Perhaps she's longing to hear her inner voice again. That's what I think. I'll wait for you tonight at 8 at Spiegel If her condition doesn't improve by tomorrow, we'll take her to the hospital. -Yes, Father. -Thank you, Sister. Thank you. Where have you been? Sister Moniq's blood pressure is elevated. She fainted. I'm sorry, Sister. Let's wait for Sister Mila, okay? You can read this. Yes. Do you accept... Do you accept the responsibility of being a good role model to your child... When you let lust rule your life, it will turn into the biggest sin. Never promise something you haven't thought through carefully. You will lose the desire. He who interferes with the fate of others... will never find his own fate. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, Father. -What do you have there? -It's for you. -Who's it from? -Sister Maryam. Thank you. Could you give this to Sister Maryam? I'm sorry, Father. But I can only give it to her tomorrow. Never mind, then. -Thank you, Father. -You're welcome. -Sister Hana. -Yes. -Are you going back to the convent? -I am. Would you do me a favor and give this to Sister Maryam? Thank you. Good afternoon, Sisters. -It's you. -I have something for you. -New songs. -Thank you. Whose turn is it? Can I go? This should go... here... Father, I gave your note to Sister Maryam just this morning. I forgot. I'm sorry. -This morning? -That's right. I'm so sorry. I'll be waiting for you outside. Thank you. Shall we go? But I can't be away for too long. Are you feeling unwell? I'm okay. I just overslept. Excuse me. You have to take another dose at 9:00. Just call me if you need anything. Sister. Sister Maryam? You forgot to give Sister Moniq her medicine yesterday, didn't you? In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Happy birthday. Thank you. Happy birthday! Blow the candles Blow the candles now Now I know how you feel. Should you stick to your vow, or should you follow your heart? If heaven is undecided for me, what right do I have to meddle in your anguish? Sister. Good morning, Sister. Morning, Father. Please give Sister Maryam some time to be with herself. Sister. Excuse me, Father. -I take my leave. -Take care. -Take care. -Thank you. -Take care. -Thank you. Thank you, Sister. Farewell, Sister. Sometimes a person thinks he knows, but he doesn't know what's wrong and what's right. Father... God is never wrong. We cause things to go wrong in the process. Sister. Not all lies are sinful. Let your worship be your secret, just as you keep your sins secret. Why should we be afraid to question sins... when God can only be found through questions? In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Now tell me what it is that burdens you. Father, on my journey to fulfill your calling, Lord Jesus, I met someone who filled the empty space in my heart and soul. His warmth and presence brought love into my life... Love that made me stray from the love you teach. I... I fell in love with a priest. I am sorry for my sin. Please forgive me for being weak in faith. Jesus taught us... to choose to be happy... in our own way. Now let your repentance be heard... in the name of Jesus Christ. And I shall give you forgiveness... in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, merciful God, I am sorry for my sins. I am worthy of your punishment. I have humiliated you, the almighty God who has shown me goodness and mercy. I condemn all of my sins and I promise, with the help of your grace, I will realign my life back to your path, and I will sin no more. God, please forgive me, for I am a sinner. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
