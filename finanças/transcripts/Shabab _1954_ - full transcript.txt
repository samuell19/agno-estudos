Have mercy Hey Giridhar Hey Giridhar Gopal, have mercy Meera's Lord Nandlal Hey Giridhar Gopal - King! King! - What's the news? Congratulations, King, a beautiful princess is born. A princess is born? Here is your first reward. Manager, a princess is born! Congratulations! Congratulations! But suggest some remedy, astrologer. This is a sorry matter. I can see it clearly. What did you see, astrologer? King, the girl is a Goddess of wealth herself. But a problem is seen in the 18th year. What are you saying? What problem? According to the horoscope, possibly then... the princess might make some mistake... that could damage... - both the empire and the crown. - Impossible. Manager, get temples built, get wells dug. And open the treasury for charity and donations. After 12 years, a flame has sparked in my dark life. I won't let this moon be eclipsed. Arrange free meals for the hungry for forty days. Distribute clothes to the poor. And arrange dance celebrations for guests. If God wishes, all faults will be rectified. Congratulations, King. Today, the princess is two years old. Wait, King. You'll keep seeing her. First, let me give solace to my heart. For the sake of old friendship, I, too, have some right. Today our son is two years old, too. King, I'll place him in your lap. Very nice. Oh wow! Wow! Wow! Landlord, do you understood? King, I understood. - This boy is now ours. - And this girl is now ours. It seems they were both born for each other. - What do you say, Lady? - If god made them for each other... then who are we to interfere? What do you say, queen? Queen, I found a groom for the princess. - Congratulations on the alliance, King. - Congratulations, congratulations. The alliance is completed. Now allow us to leave. It's not right to stay too long at a relative's place. I know you won't stay long. Manager, arrange for their departure. Now we're friends as well as relatives. This is the caravan of the king of Daulatpur. If we show courage today, our life will be settled. Careful. Hit them! Queen? Stop, heartless one! I'm still alive! Run! Hurry up! Even if we had a mouse for a child... we would have kept our reputation in the village. I say, what's the hurry? Our age isn't at an end. There's delay in His court, but no disappointment. What's the use of such a court? I wish even a black dog... Do you hear something? Hey you washerwoman, come quick over here. My goodness, washerman, so many corpses lying here! - Come on, flee! - You were asking for a child. Go and pick up the child! You wished for a black dog. God has... given you an orchid flower... orchid flower! Hey come on, hurry up. Pick him up! Go. Come on, hurry. You're worthless, useless! Such brutality happened here, and the killers absconded? King! We searched all over the jungle. - We found no trace of the dacoits. - And the child? We didn't find the child either, sir. It's an ill omen for the princess that the child went missing. Manager, carry on the search. I can't bear this shock. As you order, King. Wow... wow... wow... wow... wow... wow... wow! Live long, Chaudhary, live long. You brought a diamond from abroad... a diamond. It all god's mercy, man. Without asking, one receives a pearl. But doesn't receive alms when asking. Great, Chanda great! You went childless from here and returned with a sweet child. Hey Chaudhary, what have you named the boy? Well, I consulted the almanac. The chosen name for the boy is Ratan. Hey you Khanga, what are you staring at from there? Nothing... nothing, Chaudhary. I was thinking. Hey, what would you think? Everything is written here in the notebook. Two rupees on your birth, two rupees on your... tonsure ceremony and 4 rupees on your engagement. Right, Lallu? Take out eight rupees in silver. Don't touch, you goon! You scared my boy. Go go what are you watching? - Ratan! Oh Ratan my son! - Father, I'm here! Look at you. It's evening. Birds and animals... have all gone home and my son is still here. What love have you found in this well? Father, look, I call the fireflies inside this well. And someone calls me from inside the well. Who calls me, father? Son, the god of music lives in this well. Father, let me meet the god of music. Tell me, father! Okay, son. I'll take you to the god of music. But not today. The day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow is the Tuesday fair. You'll be blessed. Look I brought an ektara (string instrument) for you... ektara. Come on, now come home. God is in control of the devotee Ask for it. Everyone receives a donation Who is it? Marvelous! - Whose boy is this? - Ours, Sage. He's your slave, Sage. He's come to ask for music. Bless him. I brought him to your feet. There is the glory of the sun on the boy's forehead. And goddess Saraswati resides in him. He is full of knowledge. - All hail Gopal. - All hail Gopal. All hail Gopal. Ratan! - My child! I'm ruined! - Ratan! My child. Oh god, I'm ruined! Be quiet!

And we also saw that not death... but music is the stronger in the world. Sage. Sage, my Ratan died. Now your Ratan is alive. You gave life so you give him music also, Sage. Thank you, Sage. - Chanchal, how much farther? - Just a little more, princess. Upon reaching there, right after lighting the lamp at Mangalkuan... (well of prosperity ) all sorrows will disappear. No one returns disappointed from that court. God, palace for living. Servants and maids for serving. I have everything you gave. But there's sorrow even in this abundance of joys. No one had been able to rid me of it. I don't sleep, god. I want to sleep. Music is the power of god. Ram resides in every heart When a passionate singer sings sweet melodies... it brings comfort to the listener Father. Call singers. Request musicians. The cure for my disease is music. I've received this message. - Music? - Yes, King. Music is very powerful. Blown out lamps are relit. Dry clouds begin to rain. In the old days the greatest of diseases... were treated with music alone. Then what are you waiting for? Call singers from far and near. And declare, the one whose music puts the... princess to sleep, he'll earn his weight in gold coins. He'll get whatever he wishes. Tell me the truth Where did you spend the night? Tell me the truth You'll burn me to ashes Dear, what will you answer to god? - Tell me the truth. - No! They don't have the water for which my ears thirst. Tell Manager to send them away. And furthermore, a hundred gold coins... a shawl and a fantastic reward. Why? Because the princess can't sleep. She has to be cured by music. So many musicians are being auditioned. We'll sing and earn the reward. If it had been Tansen, Khusro, or... Baba Haridas, then there was a chance. Huh, now who can cure with music? Hey Vaid (doctor), did you forget the Sage of Mangalkuan... brought my Ratan back to life with music? But where is Sage anymore, Chaudhary? It's been ages since he passed away. Uncle, you're forgetting. Baba is gone. But his music lives on. Rivers may dry up, but not the ocean. Yes, rightly said. How could these blind people... know when it's day and when it's night? So, son, what are you thinking? When would your penance of so many years come worthy? Chaudhary, may I say something, if you don't mind? Don't let your son go. - Father, I'll go. Bless me. - Go, my dear go. My heart says you'll certainly... add glory to your guru's name. Go. If your mother was alive today... I wonder what she'd do. Go, son. Go. Sir, one more singer has arrived. These singers are becoming a disease. One person was supposed to be cured... but the whole palace will fall sick. Call him. - This means you've come to cure? - Yes, sir. Boy, uh... Do you even know if... there are seven notes or eight in music? My music will answer this. Before now the princess hasn't been exposed to... soft melodies and sweet tunes. On hearing those, even the gods and goddesses start dancing. But this power is not with the merchants of art. The priests of art have it. But a problem is seen in the 18th year. Possibly then the princess might make some mistake... that could damage... both the empire and the crown. Child. A strange singer has come. And he speaks strangely as well. - Shall I call him or send him away? - What does he say? He claims the princess will gain sleep. - But he requires a unique condition. - What condition? He says while he sings, all the lamps should be extinguished. - He doesn't want to sing in the light. - Why? He doesn't want anyone to see his face. I agree. The elephant drowns and the hyena asks... how deep the water is. The great ones failed. Now let's see... what miracle this singer in the dark performs. He'll do it. He'll earn the reward. Will he get the reward or get killed? Others escaped, but he can't. He won't leave. Music is the power of god Ram resides in every heart When a passionate singer sings a sweet raga... it brings comfort to the listener A sandalwood cradle with strings of silk... will swing you to sleep My beloved, you go to sleep just as... a bride sleeps on her wedding bed I put the moon as a dot on your forehead I'll have you wear a garland of stars I'll give you sleep by singing bed time songs to you I will swing you to sleep... in your sandalwood cradle Someone calls from up in the sky Fairies have come to decorate your palanquin Go great distances to meet your sweetheart Fly to meet him. Go great distances The moon calls, Chakori (bird), come to me I will swing you to sleep... in your sandalwood cradle My child is still sleeping. Manager, the singer has magic, not music. - Load him with rewards. - As you order, King. And listen, inform me when my child awakens. Congratulations on a peaceful sleep, princess. I'm grateful, I'm grateful. - So, princess, how was the night? - Very nice. Someone was singing last night. And my life was dancing intoxicated on the... sweet melody of the Veena (string instrument). I reached the heights of heaven... and fell sweetly asleep. - Child. - Greetings, Manager. Come in. Stay happy, be prosperous. - The king asked how you feel. - I feel nice, very nice. Manager, where is that singer? Child, he is a distant traveler. He said it's a victory for his guru and for music. He came only for the victory. - Now he wants to return home. - Stop him. Stop him. I want to learn his art. Solitude. Princess, as beautiful is the voice of the singer... so horrible is his face. He's a leper. His whole body stinks. His nose is melted, his eyes sunken. Disease flows from his mouth. And the whole face is hideous, like a curse from god. Sandalwood cradle, string of silk Manager, my interest is music, not the face. - Stop him. - Child, if you have decided... then I suggest that during the music lessons... there should be a curtain between you two. Otherwise the sweet dreams of night will be broken forever. - I accept. - Very well. Why is the traveler stopped from going? The king has ordered that you teach music to the princess. - Possible? - Why not? The student should be interested. Perhaps you don't understand... about those who live in palaces. Well, the princess doesn't have any short comings. But she's very hot tempered by nature. Yesterday she gouged the eyes of a singer. Since she got the pox she can't see. She's blind in both eyes. Now think, can you teach music to a blind person? Music needs ears, not eyes. Apart from being blind, she's ugly too. Hence, she appears before no one. - You'll have to sit behind a curtain. - I'm ready. Then let god save you. From today you're the royal singer. My son has become the royal singer. I'll distribute sweets to the whole village. Distribute sweets later, Chaudhary. First, deliver clothes by evening. I've to go with the groom's procession. Here are your clothes, Lala! I've given up washing clothes. And listen to this also, Lala. If I don't build a mansion in front of your mansion... then I won't call myself Lakhia Chaudhary! My son has become the royal singer! Royal singer! Be careful, nobody apart from you both should enter inside. This is my order. - Have you come? - Yes. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Would you be able to listen to my voice? - Excuse me? - I asked if you'd be able to listen to my voice. - Yes. There's no need to feel shy. Beautiful art turns even an ugly face to beautiful. You are right. Even the blind or a leper can enjoy art. I respect it. - I sympathize with you. - And I too. Start the lesson. Now pick up the Veena. - We'll start the first lesson with melody. - Very well. Only one melody can be learned in a day. And after practicing each melody... a new lamp should be lit in the name of goddess Ragini. Ragini is my name. I address Saraswati (goddess of art) with this name. Let's begin. The intoxicated harp of the heart plays Come, yogi, life dances The intoxicated harp of the heart plays The heart swings along with the wind The lovely monsoon came dancing With dedication I watch every moment... of your beauty, your dreams in the monsoon The intoxicated harp of the heart plays To play Holi in beauty land, the fairies have come dancing It's the spring season, the color the heart Be mesmerised and speak the language of love Sing together The intoxicated harp of the heart plays Fire! There's fire! There's fire! There's fire! There's fire! Fire! There's fire! There's fire! - Blind? - Leper? - Blind. - Leper. The intoxicated harp of the heart plays - Fire! Fire! - Hey, what happened?! - Then what did you see? - I saw two stars collide. - Now a storm is about to come. - What unruliness is this? What storm is about to come? Not about to come, sir. It has arrived. - What are you babbling? - Your maid is right. The wall you raised collapsed from the power of music. - And now beauty and art are face to face. - Shut up! Insolent! Answer me, why you did this? To save the honor of the palace... the repute of the family and the glory of the empire. - A huge danger came before me. - What danger? The singer's looks and his art. And hence you said the princess is horrible. She couldn't be trusted. You thought I was an ignorant child... who couldn't think about her good and bad! Child, no matter how old you grow by the magic... of days and years, you'll always remain a child for me. Don't mind. What do you wish? I want to complete my music education. Then go and fulfill your wish. No obstacle will prevent it now. Greetings. What's the matter? You look somewhat lost today. Are you all well and fine? Chanchal told me that last night you went to bed very late. Is this right? I think, even today you won't sleep. - Why? - Because you've begun going to bed late. Look, I kept thinking the whole night. And I, too, kept thinking this country is strange. Here the moon is called an eclipse, the monsoon is called fire... and beautiful flowers are called thorns. May I ask why it is so? Actually the Manager is... a little skeptical by nature. He was afraid I'd lose heart on seeing you. And the honor of the palace, the repute of the family... and the glory of the empire would be harmed. Rest assured, if such a time comes... then I myself will leave from here. An artist knows how to be destroyed, but doesn't know how to destroy. Dig the foundation deep, even deeper. A tall mansion is going to be built. Yes. - Match the tuning. - They're matched. Tighten the first string. A little more. A little more. A little more. A little more. A little more. You went too far. Take this. Play my Veena. See 'Yaman Kalyan'. This melody is from the 'Kalyan' group of melodies. Its primary note is 'ga' and the sub note is 'ni'. It has all the seven notes. That's why it is called a complete melody. After the melody go to the tune. 'Ga' is the middle note. Play 'Pancham' and go to the complete note. Play 'sa'. Now stop there. Now, to give the effect of 'Yaman Kalyan', play a note... of 'ni' 're' 'ga' and then go to 'ni' 're' 'sa' Ni, Re, Ga Ni, Re, Sa No, no, your fingers aren't moving correctly. Place the fingers on the strings like this. So, Lallu how are the walls? The walls have been raised, Chaudhary. - But now the work ahead? - Hey, it will happen. The walls have been raised. Now who... can stop the work ahead? Right, Lala? Come on, move! I want to see how much distance is left... between interest and music. Today sing a devotional song from your heart. I don't know any. I remember a love song. Chanchal sings it often. Okay, sing it. Whoever's song it may be, the voice should be yours. I'll become an ascetic, sweetheart, because of you Sweetheart, because of you, oh beloved, because of you I'll become an ascetic, sweetheart, because of you Your song has won the heart My childhood was set on fire... my childhood Let no one else come into the eyes I'll worship my darling every day I'll sing of my affection as if I were a worshipper Sweetheart because of you, oh beloved, because of you I'll become an ascetic, sweetheart, because of you My darling, I'll stay in your heart I'll fill up my drape with love Oh dweller of the heart, oh handsome one Leaving the high palaces... I'll come to your lane as a beggar Sweetheart, because of you, oh beloved, because of you I'll become an ascetic, sweetheart, because of you 'If such a time comes then I myself will leave from here.' 'An artist knows how to be destroyed, but doesn't know how to destroy.' What are you thinking? You didn't like the song? - I want to leave here. - Did I do something wrong? No, madam. The work for which I came is finished. It's still incomplete. Whatever I could have taught, I've taught. And what I wanted to learn, I couldn't learn. May I ask why you want to leave? Manager's criticism has begun to disturb me. You tell me, should I stay here under these conditions? The question is difficult. I can't answer here. Where have you brought me? What place is this? Difficult questions are answered here. Chanchal. - What did you do? - This answers your question. I didn't understand. Men are often dimwits. I'll explain. Look up. Do you see anything? I see... so many drapes tied in pairs. But why? My master, those aren't drapes. These are the bonds of wishful hearts. They'll be untied on the day... the wishes of the people who tied them are fulfilled. Here, people ask for each other. What have you asked for, princess? I've asked for you. This bond won't be broken I suppose? A bond should not be broken... oh Rama, even if life ends The anklet of the beautiful lady is tinkling The longing of my heart, oh sweetheart, remember this Apart from you, in this world I belong to no one. I belong to no one Remember this The longing of my heart, oh sweetheart, remember this The anklet of the beautiful lady is tinkling Love is not just a weak thread, darling... tied today, darling, and broken tomorrow Keep my honor throughout life Keep me in your heart Remember this The longing of my heart, oh sweetheart, remember this The anklet of the beautiful lady is tinkling If we're separated, then I'll lose my life Let God forbid that day I should not lose you Take care my dream doesn't get crushed Remember this The longing of my heart, oh sweetheart, remember this Apart from you, in this world I belong to no one. I belong to no one Remember this The longing of my heart, oh sweetheart, remember this The anklet of the beautiful lady is tinkling Save the turn, King. Your pawn is being taken. Trapped in a strange move. How should I save? I'll tell you, sir. Let the minister proceed. Otherwise, you'll lose the pawn. I'll become an ascetic, sweetheart, because of you Tell me madam, is the slave out of tune today? - Shut up, naughty one! - My god. Today eyebrows have become swords... and the eyelids, daggers. On just raising the eyes, the poor fellow will fall flat. Chanchal, now my eyes won't raise in his presence. My limbs are becoming numb with shyness. Enough. Because of this weakness... women lose and men win. Wait a moment. This is a woman's shield. Put on the veil. The eyes can raise and you won't feel shy, either. - All right, today I'll sit in front of him with the veil. - Oh god. The bond should not be broken... Pick this up and leave here! - You aren't needed anymore. - Wait. - The reason? - You are a royal servant. A servant's job is to follow orders, not to question them. You're forgetting, an artist serves only art. Tell me the reason. I can only say you must vacate the mansion. Tomorrow's sun should look down on neither you nor your art. And that is your payment. Distribute these silver pieces among the poor. I don't need these. Chanchal, have a look. Is my face visible? Radha smiles within the heart, but is shy in the eyes. She peeps from the sides of her eyes, and hides her feelings. Don't tease me. Go and call him. The path to the well is very rough. Darling, keep the honor of the veil. Where? Where are you going, singer? Away from this world of royalty and crown... where no one insults and expels anyone. But, singer, the princess waits for you. - What shall I tell her? - Tell her not to wait for me. And to untie that bond she tied. Listen. The princess tied you in that bond. She prayed to get you. Tell her not all human prayers are answered. And the ones that are fulfilled don't remain prayers. But how will her days pass in separation? Give the solution before leaving. I'm leaving, but my Veena is with her. Tell her, my life is in the strings of the Veena. She should be careful the strings aren't broken. And tell her not to panic. Travelers might go away... but the path doesn't go away. Take off the veil, princess. The royal singer is gone! Gone where? Away from this world of royalty and crown... where no one insults and expels anyone. I tried, but he wouldn't stop. But he certainly said that... his life is in the strings of the Veena. He said to be careful the strings aren't broken. But why did he leave? Who forced him to leave? I gave the instructions, princess. And the King also wishes the same. Beloved took away my heart The world snatched the heartbeat Tell me how can the Veena play... without strings now? Had I known my beloved was leaving... I'd have set fire to the veil By breaking the shackles of modesty, friend... I would have appeased my dear beloved The honor of my necklace and fine clothes is gone Along with my sweetheart, my zest and desire are gone My lover doesn't come home I'd have sacrificed body and heart... I'd have sacrificed body and heart for him Had I known my beloved was leaving... I'd have set fire to the veil The ritual of love didn't suit me, friend I repented being a bride, friend Had I not cared for the shame of the world... By sending him a letter I'd have called him Had I known my beloved was leaving... I'd have set fire to the veil Will this relationship break down? 'Will we be separated?' 'The mansion's authority has reached here.' Stop! Stop! He's been injured! I hope he survives. I hope he survives. Friends, there is still life in him. He'll survive. 'Only one melody could be learned in one day.' 'And before practising every melody... a new lamp should be lit in the name of goddess Ragini.' 'Where you stop, that's your destination.' 'I taught you everything I know.' Princess! Princess? I searched many places. I sent our men everywhere. But the royal singer is nowhere to be found. So... So tell the minister... to burn all these corpses! What are you thinking? Your son didn't write? No friend. It's been five weeks... there's no news from him. God knows what's happened to my brother. Why have you stopped work, Chaudhary? If you're tired, then come to my house. Your son disappeared that night. Why not, Lala? I'll surely come if needed. He, too, was here to make fun of me. I have to go myself to stop the villagers from talking. Friend, what was there yesterday is gone today. What is today won't be there tomorrow. Forget everything. Just like I have. - So you too... - Yes. I, too, am someone else today. I was someone else yesterday. When the inner voice called out I woke up. Now I serve these poor and helpless people... to atone for my sins. - God will forgive me. - God will forgive me. Oh Ram, I can't walk this path Dear, tell me something. Do you have any parents... or, like the others, they've abandoned you? No, my father lives in Chandipur. His name is Lakhia Chaudhary. I wanted to go home. But how would I face them? Hey stop! Who are you? Are you drunk, guard? Beware! He is the royal singer's father. If he's the royal singer's father, why should we beware? Come on, sir. We'll take you there. Let's go. There! What did I tell you? The palace is ours and its servants will also serve us. - Please come in. Come on. - Let's go. You wait here. First let him go in. Don't worry. I'll call for you once I go in there. Give me the basket. - Come on, mister. - Come on! Please come, sir. - I'll rest. - Pappu, launderer! Welcome sir. - Listen! - What is it? Salute him. The royal singer's father is here. Where is he? The son was a royal singer. But the father looks like a bigger singer than him. Right? Sir, let's hear something. - Sing anything you like. Right brothers? - Yes! I don't sing. My son does. Then what do you sell? I'm a launderer. But I've left that work. So you're a launderer? That's why you've ironed your face. What's in this bag? Don't touch that. It contains a father's love. Such beautiful love! Old man, your son has been thrown out. Thrown out? Yes, he's been thrown out. Old man, he was unworthy of living in the palace. Go look for him in a liquor bar. Chaudhary? What happened? That happens to poor people. Didn't you say I'd be respected and honored? This is how the royal singer's father has been honored. And Ratan? He, too, must have been rewarded similarly. Laddo! Get some cool water and a plateful of bread. The beggars are here. Feed them with pleasure. Narayan! Narayan! Beggars, that's all you've brought. The market isn't good, chief. There's a slump in business. There is so much scarcity that I didn't get anything. My throat went sore from blessing them. And after all that, nobody gave me anything. Friends, the bread got from begging can keep your body alive... but it kills your soul. Give me this instrument. I'll teach you a song today. Wonderful, my friend! Do you also know how to sing? My music is for others, not for myself. Friends, there is disgrace in begging... and peace in hard work. Come. Work hard on music from now on. God willing, you won't have to beg. Live long, my friend. - Move aside. - Move! Be seated! Be seated! Friends, what are you looking at? Get going! A cradle of sandalwood The thread of silk I rock the cradle to invite the sleep The way the bride waits for the groom Adorn her forehead with a moonlike dot Adorn you with a garland of stars A cradle of sandalwood The thread of silk I rock the cradle to invite the sleep A cradle of sandalwood Listen, call them here. Chanchal, ask them who taught them this song? Surdas, who has taught you this song? A gentleman did. He is a godsend to our group. Chanchal! Ask him what he looks like. Surdas, what's he look like? Who knows? I'm blind. I hear he looks like a prince. But he seems very sad. Very sad. Chanchal, don't let them leave. - Surdas? - Yes, madam. The one who taught you this song... if you bring him here, you'll receive so much... you'll never go hungry the rest of your life. - Really? - Chanchal! Give this to him. - Surdas. - Yes madam. - Show me your bag. - Yes, put it in. Put it in. Donate it. Donate it. Fill my bag. God will give you more. Donate it. Yes, donate it. Wonderful. Son! Son! Laddo! Oh Laddo! Get some cold water and a plate of bread. The beggars have come. Feed them with pleasure. Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! Happiness is here! Happiness is here! Foreigner! Oh foreigner! Yes, chief. What magic have you taught them? It looks like they looted a market! - Surdas? - Yes. What are you hiding? Chief, my bag is different. Today it's very heavy. Okay, bring it here. Take it son. Take the instrument. Hail Lord Shiva! What's this iron object doing amongst gold and silver? Fool, where did you get it from? Take a look. What is it? 'My life is hopeless.' 'The rudders have broken.' 'Who will take the boat across?' Surdas, I hope you haven't looted someone's safe by mistake. We're already infamous. Chief, the safe itself came to Surdas. All this was donated by the madam in the palace. And she also said, if I bring the one who taught me the song... she'd give me so much money... I'd not go hungry for the rest of my life. So friend? What do you think? Surdas, if you go there again, tell them... my songs aren't for the palace people. Well said! But teach them one more song... and I'll build an ashram for your friends. They might be old but they are quick learners. Yes. Oh you, who live in palaces... why should I come to your door? We love our houses. We don't want big houses Oh you, who live in palaces... There's no rich or poor. Everyone is equal here This world belongs to the one who created us We have his support. Why worry about the world? Oh you, who live in palaces... Don't give us money as alms We long to be loved. Give us some love We are hungry for a glance. We don't need wealth Oh you, who live in palaces... We would reject diamonds and pearls given with disgrace We would even reject love if given with hatred If you don't give it with respect then we don't want it Oh you, who live in palaces... why should I come to your door? We love our houses. We don't want big houses Oh you, who live in palaces... - Surdas! - Here I come, madam. I'm coming. Give it to me, madam. Come on. Surdas, didn't you bring your teacher? He said his songs aren't for palace people. Madam, give his share to me. God will bless you. Madam! Madam? What was the reply, Chanchal? He says his songs are not for the palace folks. Seems like a heartbroken recluse. Only he can reply like this. Go, make Surdas rich. It's him. It's him. Surdas, that's it? Nothing else. What else do you want? It's like we've got a chicken laying silver eggs. This is nothing, chief. If the foreigner comes with me, then not just silver... we'll be playing in gold. I swear! - It's all because of Surdas' luck. - Yes. Right. Come all of you. Food is served! Let's go! Let's have some food! Out of love for you, I wore simple clothes I gave up jewels and jewelry The conditions under which... you're living happily... I'll also accept those conditions I've become an ascetic for you, oh beloved For you, oh beloved For you, oh darling I've become an ascetic for you, oh beloved My beloved, I'll live in your heart I'll fill my life with your love With your love Oh my darling. Oh my dear Giving up the luxury of palaces... I've come to your doorstep as a beggar Darling, for you My beloved, for you I've become an ascetic for you, oh beloved Oh dear. A woman at home is a symbol of respect. On the streets she's considered immoral. I want to see you being respected. Not being disgraced. Sometimes an intelligent poor person... can also become the pride of the world. I'd like to be that poor person, not just another rich person. Friends, do you see that? I feel like there's one more person among us. Then let's welcome her. Hail Lord Shiva! Who are they? They are what I am. And madam, who are you? I? I am what he is. Well said! Hail Lord Shiva! - Come on, the food will get stale. - Coming. - Come on, madam. - Let's go. Come on. Have you ever had such tasty food anywhere else? No. I feel like I'm in heaven. Dear, ask for more if you want. There's more in the kitchen. This is more than enough. I'll never be able to repay such a favor. Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! Oh beloved, remember the feelings of my heart In this world, no one is as dear as you Remember? What place is this? I do. This is the place where you get answers to difficult questions. And people respect each other here. Singer, why did you make your music so cheap? Why did you remove it from the palace and bring it to the slums? Music is just an entertainment at the palace. And here it's a means to earn bread. Answer me. Does the country need entertainment or bread? I can't answer. I request that you return. Ever since you left I have lost my sleep. Why is that so? The eyes that long to see my beloved... how can they find any sleep? My sleep has become used to your music. Whenever you want to sleep... chant the lord's name and light a lamp. My music will reach you. And you? Life may keep us apart. But my life will end at your doorstep. This is a singer's promise. And they are my witness. These dumb fireflies? They aren't fireflies! These are the souls of the lovers who had been separated... who suffered all their lives. And are also suffering after death. Maybe I'll also become a firefly. If that time comes, I will not leave you. I've become an ascetic for you. I'll become a firefly with you. Every night when the lamps are lit... wait for me. But it shouldn't happen that... I'm left singing songs of separation while waiting for you. I'll surely come. Chanchal! - My lord? - Where's the princess? Here! She was right here, my lord. And she just vanished? Why not just tell me... she goes out without my permission? No, my lord. She doesn't go out. She never goes out. - My lord! - What is it, minister? What are you looking at? I was looking at a disrespectful scene, my lord. The prediction the astrologers made... has come true. My lord, look how far a misled girl can go. Come with me. This way, my lord. Chanchal! Chanchal, did anyone find out? I knew you would manage it. Chanchal, I'm very happy today. You won't understand why. You've never fallen in love. You are stonehearted. You are lifeless. Today I left the palace and went to the beggars' shelter. And becoming an ascetic, I begged for love. Our hearts met. Our eyes met. It's like getting all the happiness in this world. What are you staring at? Congratulate me. Today, love has succeeded. From today, I am his and he is mine. I have vowed to live and die with him. And I have promised him I'd meet him every evening. Nobody knows the joy in this sweet union. Chanchal, today I lunched with the beggars for him. Really, there's no fun eating in these palaces. I wish I could do away with this kingdom. Do away with this artificial fame and status. And do away with these fake principles... which have made my life a living hell. - My lord! - Father? - Get up, my lord. - Father? Princess, don't come any closer. Minister, give me support. Can't you see my crutch has broken? Father! I want to say something. Princess, there are some more things left... for you to do away with. They are, a father's love, a daughter's duty... and the honor of the family. Do away with them! Burn them to ashes! Nothing should be left incomplete. Look at me! Listen to me! With what eyes do I look? With what ears do I listen? My eyes are lowered with shame. I'm too humiliated to listen. You've made your decision. Now it's my turn. Then listen. I will see your face again... when you wear the wedding gown... with love for your husband... and agree to get married. This is my decision. Princess! It's too late to search now. Who are you waiting for? Let's get in the hut. I can't, chief. Someone has made a promise. Deceitful ways of a deceitful world. Nobody fulfills a promise. She won't deceive me. He must be waiting for me, Chanchal. I must go there at least once. Forget about going there, princess. The minister has locked all the doors. Security has been tightened. He said it shouldn't happen... that he's left singing songs of separation waiting for me. My beloved didn't come Even after promising I am tired. I am losing patience The moon has hidden There is darkness The stars seem like imitation pearls The eyes have become misty My beloved didn't come Even after promising Come, for without you my eyes are moist The night is long. Life is short Let me see you to my heart's content My beloved didn't come Even after promising For whom are these bracelets, minister? For you, dear. The king of Rajgarh has sent them to you for your engagement. His Highness has said if the princess wears them... then an old father's honor would be upheld. Or else neither the honor nor the father would survive. Princess, what will happen now? Whatever my fate is. Chanchal, I'm helpless, but not you. Go! He would still be waiting for me. Tell him, on one side is my duty... and on the other my love. It is difficult to decide. Ask him what I should do. Friends, if you go to the palace, then sing this song this time. And if someone stops you, then tell them, music is honest... but the world turned out to be dishonest. Friends, what are you looking at? Get started. Live long, friend! Have a long life, friend. Sit down. Sit down. I want to live and die at your doorstep I want to live and die at your doorstep My life will be ended... at your doorstep Die at your doorstep You have come? I was just telling my friends to tell the palace folk... that music is honest but the world turned out to be dishonest. It was a terrible mistake. Princess, I spent many sleepless nights waiting for you. I lit the lamps for our meeting and then put therm out. Princess, look. The fireflies are still suffering from separation. Come out, princess. Let me look at you. Come out, princess. The princess couldn't come. The royal guard is here. Minister! Minister, I agree wealth and power have stopped the flow of rivers. It has defeated great kings and kingdoms. But even wealth and power can't stop love. Arrest him! Stop! Release him, master. He's innocent. I request you! I request you! Chanchal, you're back? What did he say? Why don't you speak? Do the fireflies glow on the hilltop in the same way? Do the drapes flutter on the trees? Yes, princess. Both the fireflies and drapes were there. But the one I went to meet wasn't there. He went away but left this letter behind. 'I want to live and die at your doorstep.' My life is a living hell... oh lord, in your world My partner left me in the middle of a storm Oh lord, in your world, my life is a living hell His coming and leaving... was a game of fate The days I spent in love were just dreams Oh lord, in your world, my life is a living hell He took with him the musical instruments and also his voice The wishes of my heart have been left unfulfilled Oh lord, in your world, my life is a living hell Oh beloved, remember the feelings of my heart The damsels sing the song. Their anklets are tinkling Love is not any weak thread, darling... tied today, darling, and broken tomorrow Respect me all your life I think of you all the time Just remember Oh beloved, remember the feelings of my heart The damsels sing the song. Their anklets are tinkling What was that? - Some stone on the road, princess. - Get up. Oh you, who deceived me in love... may you have a happy life. Let us in. We want to meet the king. Nobody can meet the king now. We will meet the king today. Get away! Who is it? My lord! Our fields are empty. We have a request! We have a request! Send them in. I would like to remind the king of the time 18 years ago... when the landlord of Daulatpur... was a guest at the princess' birth... and was killed in a bandit attack. How do you know about the bandits? The king may punish me but I was part of the gang. And I know for sure the royal singer is the same boy. What proof do you have? Proof? I'll show you the proof. I have preserved all the belongings from his childhood. This is his shirt. These are his shoes. This is his turban. And this is the royal necklace which was around his neck. This is bad. I've been shamed by a launderer. He has raised the royal heir with all his love. And I throw him out. - But, my lord... - I've been unjust to my daughter. Bring the royal singer to me with all the respect. The time to make him my son-in-law has passed. It's time to make him my son. Go on. Go quickly. On the happy occasion of the wedding... a group of beggars were freed. I think he went with them. I can't say where he went. There is one more place. He must be there. Come with me. - Let's go, Chaudhary. - Let's go. Lock him up! He's a criminal! We'll decide his punishment later. - Chief! - Chaudhary, this is my punishment for my sins. Let's go, Chaudhary. If you find him, tell him not to forget my friends... as there's no one to support them. Tell him make an ashram for them. - Princess! - Chanchal! Princess, bad news! Why are you crying? What happened? What never should have happened. The royal singer was none other than... the prince of Daulatpur, your intended husband. Shameless! Slap me on my other cheek, princess. But I'll say what I came to say. The secret was revealed... when Lakhia Chaudhary of Chandipur came searching for him. After Ratan's parents were killed, he was raised by him. The sad part is you two became engaged during your childhood. Where is he now? Minister had him locked up in a cell. From here he left with the beggars. Now nobody knows where he went. Chaudhary, what's the matter? I've lost my Ratan. Chaudhary! Chaudhary! - Your Ratan has come. - Where is he? Where is my son? I saw him in the house. Come quickly lest he leave again. Ratan! My son! Chaudhary! Where is Ratan? Ratan! - Ratan! - Father... the mansion wasn't built. Forget the mansion. I want my Ratan. Ratan! Son! What have you done, my son? I've performed a ritual, father. My ritual started with music... and ended with the gift. Father, the goddess took away my hands as gift. Son, what have you done? - Doctor! - Don't waste any more time, Chaudhary. The infection has spread. Doctor, do something, for god's sake. There's no chance of survival. Come with me. Hurry up! Come on! Lallu, you come, too. Chaudhary? - What is it, Lallu? - Don't listen to the doctor. - Why not? - He killed my son by frightening him. What should I do then, Lallu? I know a royal doctor. Let's take Ratan to him. Take care of your son. I'll get the cart. - Hurry up! - Right away! - Hurry! Greetings, aunt. Where is the doctor? He's gone to Rajgarh. He's been gone seven days. The queen is sick. Call him quickly, Lallu. He may lose his life. Chaudhary, get in the cart. We have to go to Rajgarh. We have no time. Hurry up. Let's go. Hurry! Let's go! Cart driver! Hurry! Madam! Madam, please take care of my son. I'm leaving my son in your care. I'll return quickly with the doctor. Right away. I've given medicine for seven days. The queen will be completely cured. Now I don't need to remain here. Where is my father? He'll return soon. He's gone to Rajgarh to get the doctor. - Rajgarh? - Yes. The queen, Ragini Devi... ever since getting married, she can't sleep. Ragini Devi? She can't sleep? Why not? Son, where are you going at this hour? I'll go to the one who can't sleep. She had said her sleep was used to my singing. I'll go where my life is. What will I say to them? Stop son! Where are you going in this condition? This wind and this environment remind me of her Come, let's go Don't bother about your own happiness Give happiness to others With the desire, I set out from my house My life should end where my lover is Oh stars, begin to glow Oh flowers, begin to smile Make fun of my unsuccessful love Make fun of me The one I had worshipped... She turned out to be stonehearted My life should end where my lover is It is my desire to place... my head at your doorstep There's neither a tear in my eyes nor a complaint on my lips If death comes this way... I will have no sorrows With the desire, I set out from my house I tried to stop him. I tried to convince him. But he said she can't sleep. Why can't she sleep? 'Now you'll be able to sleep'. That's what the doctor said. What? Of course. I'll be able to sleep. Of course you will. Stop thinking so much. You're right. You gain nothing by just thinking. - Listen? - Yes, this is the place. Go, sit there. Go on! Sit there. Today you have to carry out a custom of our family. Come with me. What custom? During every Diwali festival... the queen herself gives the alms to the beggars. You, too, have to carry out this custom. Let's go. We have to carry out the customs of the world. - Mister! - I told you, you, too, will get it. Go on. Go on. Sit there. Now sit down. - I say... - No need to say anything. You'll get what you want. Sit down. Hail to the queen! Hail to the queen! Your treasury will be full! Your husband will have a long life! Have a happy married life! Bring your hands forward. Your husband will have a long life. Have a happy married life. Hail to the queen! Hail to the queen! Hail to the queen! Go now. You've got what you came for. Go on. Go on. Yes, brother. I got it. What I came here for. One task has been completed, my queen. One is remaining. Which one? You brought the instrument, but left your voice behind. May I ask why you're angry with it? Why would I be angry? This is worth worshiping for me. I used to hear you are a very good singer. I heard the praise, not your singing. Let me hear you sing. I would like to live and die at your doorstep. Just what I wanted to say. I would like to hear this. Die at your doorstep I want to live and die at your doorstep My life will end at your doorstep Die at your doorstep I am at your doorstep to give up my life You may see it or you may not I'll wander around your house constantly Die at your doorstep My love for you will never lessen I will die for you and you will not know After death I will come to your land Die at your doorstep My life will end at your doorstep Die at your doorstep I want to live and die at your doorstep Didn't you sleep the whole night? I can't sleep. God knows why you can't sleep. He's dead. Who died? A beggar. What is it? What's going on? Master, a corpse is lying under the tree. My life is in the strings of this instrument. Keep it safe. Don't let the strings break. No! No! No! - Where are you going? - What happened to the dead man? - Who was he? - Some poor man. His old father came. He took his body. Where? People were speaking of some village. Chandipur! Chandipur? - Dharamsingh! - Master. Where's the queen? Master, all I know is the queen called for the carriage last evening... and asked the driver to take her to Chandipur. Singer! They aren't fireflies! These are the souls of the lovers who had been separated... and suffered all their lives. And are also suffering after death. Princess, maybe I'll also become a firefly. If that time comes, I won't leave you. I've become an ascetic for you. I'll become a firefly with you. Whenever you want to sleep... chant the lord's name and light a lamp. My music will reach you. Oh God, I can't sleep. I'm tired of staying awake. I want to sleep. I want to sleep. A cradle of sandalwood The thread of silk I rock the cradle... to invite the sleep Someone calls from the skies above Fairies have come to decorate the cradle Go far away to meet your beloved The moon calls you to him I rock the cradle to invite the sleep A cradle of sandalwood The thread of silk I rock the cradle to invite the sleep
