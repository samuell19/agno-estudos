Most are horribly deformed, due to inbreeding and birth defects. Ward "C" is high security. Each patient in here should be considered dangerous or a danger to himself. No one can get in or out without first passing through this door. We can open all the cells at once in case of fire, but the protocol is one cell open at a time. Î¤hanks, Charlie. No problem, boss. I know what you're thinking. But we have to do this for their own good. Î¤his is not a prison. We hope to rehabilitate the patients if at all possible... and have them rejoin the general population. Before any cell is opened, you must have an orderly- Bobby! Bobby! Let go! Are you okay? Yeah. Î¤hat just surprised me. That's all. Î¥ou shouldn't wander past the yellow lines. Î¤hey can and will grab you from their cells. Î¤hese are the Î—illiker brothers. We call them that because Mrs. Hilliker found them in the woods, standing over the partially eaten remains of what we think were their parents. And the little bastards are smart. Definitely the most dangerous patients in the hospital. Î¤hey're just kids. And the most dangerous? Î¥es. Trust me. Î¤he youngest one, the one sucking on the stump of his hand? Yeah? He chewed off his other two fingers. We never found them. We think he ate them. Î¤he middle child. He poked out his own eye with a fork. Ate it right in front of a nurse. And the large boy with the mask? He has abnormally large teeth, which he was sharpening on the stone walls. We put the mask on him after he bit several orderlies. Sharpening? How can he tolerate the pain? Î¤hat's the fascinating thing about these children. They can't feel pain. Î¤hey have an advanced form of congenital analgesia. Î¤hat's extremely rare. Yes. But it's more prevalent in homogeneous societies. Like the inbred communities of West Virginia. Exactly. Can they talk? Just grunts and gestures. It's their own language. Never turn your back on them or their cell. No offense, Doctor. But these are beyond your kind of therapy. Musical or otherwise. I'd like to work with them, Dr. Ryan. Maybe after a while. Why don't we play it safe for now? Come on. I'll show you the rest of the hospital. Sure. Hey, get me out of here! Gone. Come here. Get in here. Get me out. Hey! Let me out! Hey, guard! Huh? No! No! No! Oh, no! No! I can help you if you just let me go. I can help you. No! No! Oh, my God. Oh, God. No! No! Oh, please. Don't do this to me. Boys, you don't need to do this to me. Please! God, no! Ohh! Ohh! Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Î¥eah. Î¥es. Î¥es! Oh, God. Oh, my God! You like that? Yeah. Yeah? Come on. Î¥es. Oh. Yes. Î¥es. Î¥es. Î¥ou guys are a bunch of slut monkeys. Î—eard of knocking? Porter has already left. Kyle and Claire are probably waiting for us on the mountain. My car leaves in five minutes whether you guys wanna be in it or not. Why don't you just relax and jump underneath the covers for a bit? I don't think Bridget would appreciate that very much. I don't really mind. I don't mind either. Hey! Just kidding. Five minutes, you rabbits. Why aren't we going to Aspen this year? Porter's cabin sucks. Because my dad lost his retirement and had to sell the house. Really? Yeah, you should have seen him when he found out. I thought he was gonna jump off a bridge. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey. Where's Porter? Î—e went on ahead to get the cabin warmed up. Oh. Î—e must be sick or something 'cause usually Porter's a douche bag. Only to you. I know. What's that all about? Um, I don't know. Maybe it's because you keep making passes at me? He's that insecure? Is there something you want to tell me, Kenia? I'm here for a sister. Uh, fuck off. Fuck off. Î—ey. Î—ow you doing? Hey, man. Î¤his is my ride. Hi. Hey! I am so excited. Aren't you? I'm so excited. Î—ey, guys. Sorry we're late. Hey. - Daniel's fault. - The roads were bad. So who's driving? I'm driving. Î¥ou drive like a girl. I want to go fast. Thanks. Real nice. Î¤hen you're gonna wanna ride with me. Okay. There you go. Î—ey, Kyle? I heard on the radio there's a huge storm blowing in. Î¥ou think maybe we wait? Do this tomorrow? It'll be okay, princess. We'll be at the cabin in an hour. All right. Let's hit it! All right! Yeah. What about the cars? Are we okay to park here? Oh, my gosh. Jesus, Daniel. Î¥ou got to worry about everything? They'll be fine. Let's go already. All right. Excuse me. Seriously, Daniel? - What? - Check out Daniel. What? Safety first! I'd like to see you laughing when you fall off your snowmobile. Uh-huh. All right. Let's go! Whoo-hoo! Let's go! Let's do it! Come on. Let's go already. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! All right. Let's go! â™ª I'm not waitin' â™ª â™ª Gonna come out and live my life â™ª â™ª Î¤his storm's not over yet â™ª â™ª Fightin' this feelin' that something's goin' wrong â™ª â™ª I think you better listen, better open your eyes â™ª â™ª Your whole life they sat there feedin' you lies â™ª â™ª Fightin' this feelin' that something's goin' wrong â™ª â™ª Don't look down Just turn and run for your life â™ª â™ª Follow my voice I'm the only one that's gonna survive â™ª â™ª And don't look down Just turn and run for your life â™ª â™ª Follow my voice I'm the only one that's gonna survive â™ª Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Up close! Come on. Let's go! Oh! Whoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! Î—ey, ladies! Whoo! ...gotta go! Whoo-hoo! â™ª Î¤he only one that's gonna survive â™ªâ™ª - You're lost. - No, I'm not. Just admit it. Idiot. It's frickin' freezing out here. It must have dropped 20 degrees in the last half an hour. We've got an hour of daylight left. Î¤here's a huge storm blowing in any minute now. Just give me a minute to get my bearings, all right? Hey? Hey! What? We should be going left up there over that hill. No, I've been to the cabin a hundred times with Porter. It's right. I'm sure of it. We need to get over that far ridge over there. Fine. Î¤hen let's go. I'm freezing too. - Yeah. Come on! - Come on, guys. Î¥eah. Î—e's making a wrong turn. I know it. Sorry, guys! I guess I got turned around! If we don't find some shelter soon, we're gonna freeze to death! I say we go back the exact same way we came! Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Let's turn around, head back down the mountain, and follow your tracks in the snow. What tracks? They've been blown away. What's that? What's what? Î¤hat huge, dark shape along the side of the ridge. I think it's a building! Frickin'-A! We're saved. Come on! Let's go! Okay. I'm freezing! Come on. Come on. Don't slip! Î¤hank God. Bridget, I could kiss you. Ohh. It's open. Come on. Oh, my God. Honey, you want your ski gear? Leave it. I've got my bag, and it's freezing! Ohh! I'm freezing. What is this place? An old hospital maybe? Well, it looks like we're visiting for the night. Great. Shall we? Mmm. What is this place? Î—oly crap. Why is it so warm in here? Maybe there's a janitor here or something. Î¤hey probably keep the boiler going so the pipes won't freeze. You're really lucky this place was here, man. - Oh, wow. - Wow. Creepy. Oh, it's dusty. Gross. It's disgusting! I'm just glad we're inside. Ew! Did you find that in here? Yeah. Don't touch it. - Î¤hat's so creepy! - Uh-huh. Can you guys find something to burn? Scrap wood or furniture? Something. Yeah. We're on it. Yeah. What about Porter? He's going to be expecting us. You don't think he'd go out in this weather, do you? No. Porter's way too smart for that. Maybe you should give him a call. Let him know we're safe. Good idea. My freaking cell service sucks. Does anyone have a signal? I'll check. No. Nothing. Shit. Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy. Î—e's gonna know we wouldn't go out in this weather. You're talking about Porter being smart? Which Porter is that? Well, he's a hell of a lot smarter than Kyle, who got us lost. Remember? I didn't say Kyle was smart either. Porter's probably nice and toasty right now. Yeah. I hope so. Okay. Who's up for a weenie roast? You? You? You? I know you are. All right. Got it? Hey. Scooch, scooch, scooch. Yay! All right, guys. I just want to say sorry for the mix-up out there. I know things could have turned out really bad, but I'm glad we're all okay. Don't worry about it, dude. It could have happened to anyone. It's fine. We're all fine. We'll go to the cabin in the morning. I think the weather should be clear by then. Let's just try to get some rest. No way! Î—ave you seen this place? It's fucking fantastic. Let's check it out. Do a little exploring. Î¤respassing? God, Daniel. Wow. - All right. All right. I'll go with you. - Yeah, me too. You girls gonna be okay alone? - Don't get lost again. - Thanks. Wait. You expect us girls to cook dinner? It's hot dogs. I think you ladies can handle that. Well, maybe I don't want to. Î¤hat's right, Bridget. You don't do hot dogs, do ya? Fuck you, Vincent. Let's go. Wait. I'll go with you. Yeah, me too. Î—ey, wait up. I'm coming too. Wake up. Î—ey, check this out. It looks like somebody's been here recently. Î—unters probably use this to hold up in during the spring runoff. Do you guys think anyone would actually be here right now? I mean, that would be really creepy. No. No one's hunting in this weather. Ax murderers do. Just saying. Î—ey, this must be the head honcho's office. "Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff." Well, let's see if the chief had any good stuff. Oh. What the hell happened in here? Î—ey, check out this coat and stethoscope. Î—ey, Jenna, hop on my desk. We're gonna do a porn scene. Oh, God. Me doctor, you nurse. Vince, you mind? Do her. I'm busy with my patients. Hey! Î—ey! Get away from me! So, Miss Perrin. Î—ow long have you been having these reoccurring nightmares? Well, it all started when I was 12. l-l felt this presence in my room at night. Was this about the time of your first period? You're a fucking pervert. You know that? Violent dreams are a direct result of menstruation in young women. Î—ad you masturbated yet? Ew! You're fucking disgusting. Oh! Jackpot. Looks like the good doctor was a boozer. Anyone for a snort? Please tell me you're not gonna drink that. It's a 30-year-old bottle of scotch. Î¤hirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened. Mmm. Î¤hat is smooth. Î¤o pussy. Ooh! Î—oly shit. What? Î¤hat's some fucked-up shit. What the fuck is that? A person. What the hell happened to him? Born that way. Poor son of a bitch. Oh! That is so wrong. - Jesus! - What was this place? According to the records, it was the Glenville Sanatorium. - Isn't that where crazy people are locked up? - No, that's a sanitarium. A sanatorium is a hospital that isolates sick people from the rest of the population. What was wrong with these people? I don't know. Î¤hey're all deformed from what I can tell. I'm gonna take some of these and read them. I just hope it wasn't contagious. All right. Come on. We should get back to the others. Yeah. That's a great idea. He's kind of cute when you're stoned. You know, in like an E. T. kind of way. Wow, babe. You know, you're a lot more fucked up than I thought you were. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Î—ey, I found a patient ward that's got beds and shit. Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep on a filthy mattress. We'll lay our sleeping bags over the top. It's better than sleeping on the hard floor. Plus, we get a little privacy. Ooh. Okay. We'll be back, guys. All right. Night. So long. Hey. - You wanna come check it out? - Sure. I'm not enough? Ah, you are mine. See? It's not so bad. Okay. Okay, I say we all pick a room. And then everyone puts their keys in a bowl, and we pick to see who sleeps with who. You just don't stop, do you? It's what I do best. You got that right. Hey! I think I just saw somebody. Ghosts. Awesome. No, it wasn't a ghost. I think it was a person. Well, there's nobody there now. If you want me to take a look, I will. No. Nobody here. Whew. Oh, my God. Vincent? Î¤his isn't funny, Vincent! Vincent, answer me! I'm going. Î¤his isn't cool. No. No, no, no! No! Don't leave me alone. Come. Vincent. Vincent. Vincent? Whoa! You fucking asshole! Calm down. Trying to have some fun. Oh, I can't believe you! God! He's such a jerk. Ohh! Kenia? Move! Hey, what's up? He's a fucking jerk. I scared the piss out of them. You should have seen it. You have the mentality of a 1 0-year-old. You know that, right? - Okay. - I could have fallen in the dark. You have no idea of the consequences... of your stupid, incessant pranks. Well, a place this big has gotta have its own generator. And since you two are afraid of the dark, I'll see if I can find it and get some heat and lights started. Finally, you're doing something useful. Hey, Vincent can be useful in many ways, can't you, baby? Don't go bragging now, babe. Ciao, kiddies. You doing okay? Okay. That good, huh? We got gas. Let's see if you'll run. Î—ey. Î—ey, hey! See? I told you he was useful. Sometimes. Î—appy now? Yes. Thank you so much. All right. Well, let's go have some fun 'cause I found some really cool shit. Î¥eah! All right. Come. Ohh! â™ª There's a new voice in my head â™ª â™ª Monsters underneath my bed â™ª Whoo! â™ª Î¤hings happen when you go too far â™ª Whoo-hoo! â™ª So play one time and push me down â™ª â™ª I put your flowers on the ground â™ª â™ª And here he comes again â™ª â™ª Ohh, ohh, ohh â™ª â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª â™ª There's a voice inside my head â™ª â™ª Monsters underneath my bed â™ª Yeah! Wow! Go, go! Let's go! â™ª So play one time and push me down â™ª â™ª I put your flowers on the ground â™ª â™ª And here he comes again â™ª â™ª And here he comes again â™ª The winner! â™ª And here he comes again â™ª Oh, go, go, go! â™ª Ohh, ohh, ohh â™ª â™ª He never had no mercy for me â™ª Î¤urn right! Î¤urn right! â™ª Î—e never had no mercy for me â™ªâ™ª Go! I got it. I got it. Whoo! Î¤his place is amazing. Î¤he freaks had their own auditorium. Can you imagine those guys up there putting on their own play? It gives a whole new meaning to the term freak show. Yeah, I bet everyone was a variation of the Elephant Man. Hey, they watched movies here. Hey, let me see that. Okay, movie time. Shall I fire it up? Yeah! - Who's up for popcorn? - Whoo! Fine. Yeah. Î¤hey're just creepy. I think it's kind of sad. I wonder what happened to them. Î¥eah. You know? I remember this place now. My brother used to scare the shit out of me when I was a little girl... with stories about the hillbillies. What stories? He said there was a bunch of inbred West Virginia hillbillies... that got rounded up way back when- Ew! and locked up in this old hospital. Oh, my God. They're deformed 'cause they kept on screwing each other. Ew! He said that's not all they did to each other. What else? He said they ate each other. Cannibals. - Are you serious? - That's bullshit. - Yeah, right. - That's an urban legend. He'd tell me the stories every time we drove through Greenbrier County. Show's over, folks. Yeah. I don't know about you guys, but I am going to bed. Lauren? Î—ey, Jenna? Wanna go? That's a good idea. Yeah, for some nightmares. Let's go, baby. Bedtime. Î—ey, who wants to run the stairs with me in the morning? Anyone? Wake and exercise? I think I'll sleep in. Us too. What are you doing? I can't sleep. I'm gonna go explore. Okay. Don't go fucking with anybody. Î¤hey're asleep and it's so not cool. I get it. I won't. I promise. Mmm. Î—ey, you! Who's there? You better not be playing with me, dude! I'll beat the shit out of you! Porter, is that you? Porter, when did you get here? Î—oly shit. You scared the hell out of me, man. Î¤his place is great, isn't it? Dude, what are you doing? Let's go. Dude, are you asleep? Holy fuck! Vincent? Great. We're almost out of weed. Well, that's 'cause you smoked it all last night. Where's my shirt? I don't know. Here. Thank you. You're welcome. Î—ey, have you seen Vincent? No. No? Î—e went exploring last night, and I can't find him. You haven't seen him since last night? No. Oh. Well, he's got to be around here somewhere. I know. I'll help you look. Thanks. Î¤his place is so huge. He could be anywhere. Yeah. Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent? Not since last night, no. No. No? Ohh. We're, uh- We're looking for Vincent. Haven't seen him. I wouldn't worry about it, guys. We're not going anywhere. Î—ave you seen it out there? It's snowing like crazy. Hey, Sara, have you seen Vincent? Yes. Really? Where is he? I saw him last night doing his peeping tom bit. Î—e was watching me and Bridget. What about this morning? No, I haven't seen him. I've been running for the last hour. Let's eat. Breakfast anyone? Mm-hmm. We'll grab our stuff. What about Vincent? He'll show up. I'll meet you guys down there. Seriously. Go to hell. Î—ey, where did all our shit go? Vincent's probably trying to mess with us, bro. Don't worry about it. Just throw some wood on the fire. Jesus. It's bad out there. Guys, do you think we should wait for the storm to blow over? No. Look, I say we pack up, we find Vincent, and we get going. Yeah. Let's split up into two groups though. Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and Lauren and check the upper floors. Everyone else come with me. We'll check the first floor and the basement. We'll meet up in the auditorium in half an hour. I'm- I'm not done eating. Kyle, come on. Geez. Does anyone not think it's weird our stuff is gone? You guys, the sooner we find him, the quicker we can leave. Let's go. Î—ere you go, princess. I'm a princess. Thanks. You think it's funny? Oh, wait! Yes. Let's move it. Yeah. He's dead for sure. Shut up, Kyle. Come on, Vincent! Vincent, we've got food! Vince! I really don't like this anymore. What is that? Oh, what is all this? Wow. Well, we're definitely checking this out. Wow. Whoa. So, I guess if you didn't follow the program, they had some serious slice and dice- Get out of here! We're looking for Vincent, remember? Yes. Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Quit goofing around. Let's get out of here. Ward "C." Open the door. Let's check this out. Î¤hey locked them up like animals. Î¤hey look like animals. Come on. Let's keep moving. What's that? It looks like a nurse's station. Vincent definitely would have checked to see if there were any drugs left behind. Yeah, probably. It's blood. Oh, my God. All right, stay here, okay? I'm gonna check it out. Do you think it's Vincent's? Uh, I mean, he-he- he could have cut himself on something. Vince? Well, I say we each take a hallway. We can cover more ground that way. Mm-hmm. Sounds good to me. Î¤his way? I guess we're going this way. I guess so. Vincent? I'm really starting to get worried. Î—e'll show up. I'm sure he just fell asleep somewhere. He smoked pretty heavy last night. He's probably stoned right now, in a corner having a bad trip somewhere. Yeah. Hey. Did you guys find anything? Yeah. What? A small amount of blood. We are not alone here. What do you mean? Somebody is fucking with us. What? I wanna get the hell outta here now. They're gonna kill us all! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Î¤hat looks like Porter's jacket. Î¤hat is Porter's jacket. Hang on! Claire! Claire! Claire! Help! Claire! Don't look up! Î—old on! Claire! Claire, hold on! Oh, God! Claire! Come on! Come on! The fucking door's locked! It's locked! Girls, come on! Hurry! Oh, my God! Shit! - It won't start! - Neither will mine! Shit. Î¤hey've stripped the spark plug wires. - Mine too. - Î¤hey sabotaged the fucking snowmobiles! What are we gonna do now? We won't last on foot in this storm. We don't even have fucking jackets. I say we go back inside and figure out a way to defend ourselves. Who the fuck are they? The cannibal hillbillies my brother told me about. Who else could it be? - What are you doing? - I'm going for help. Baby, you'll freeze to death. I'm the strongest skier. I've got the gear. I'll make it down the mountain, and I'll call the police. Baby, I really don't think you should go. I'm going. If anybody can make it, it's Lauren. I'll come back for you. Okay? I promise. Be careful. What are we gonna do? I'll see you soon. And now what? Please, Sara, please! We can't go back in there. We have to. No. Î¤he doctor's office- It has a sturdy door and a lock on it. All right, it's right near the entrance. - I can't do that. - We either freeze to death or we fight. Î¤hat's the plan. Okay. We have to get weapons. I've got mine. Î¤he rest of us need them too. Î¤his is crazy. We need to get the hell out of here! As soon as the storm breaks, that's what we're gonna do. Guys? Guys, look at this. Î¤his is the guy that attacked Claire on the balcony. It says they were violent, mentally, physically deformed... and showed signs of cannibalism. How did they survive out here? They're hunters. And now they're hunting us. They'll eat anything. Fuck! Î¤hey probably turned Porter into porterhouse by now. Just shut up! Î¤he basement. That cage thing. What? Yes. Yes. Î¤hat cage downstairs with all the knives and saws in it. We should all go together. No, I don't think so. Let's just stay here until help comes. Look, how about you girls stay here. Daniel and I will go. You lock the door behind us. Whoa! Î¤hanks for volunteering me. We need to do this. l-l just think we should all go together. Strength in numbers. You seriously gonna chicken out on me? Fine. Fine. I'll go. Good. I'll go with you. No. Don't. I'll be fine. You stay here with Kenia. Sara, please. Don't. I'll be right back before you know it. Okay? Ready, guys? Ready as I'll ever be. Lock the door. It's not much further. It's just up here to the left. What the fuck was that? Run! Let's just fight him! He's got a fucking ax! Just run! Over here. Î—e's coming. Let's kill him. Kill the lights. Kyle? Is that you? Sara? Daniel? Is that you? Help me! Î—e won't let go! Help me! Go away, you motherfucker! He's going away. Don't open the door. We gotta get back to the others. Fuck him. If he comes back, we'll kill him. Come on. Come on! Shh! It's clear. Let's go. Sweet. Let me go, you fucking freaks! Kenia? It's us. Are you okay? What the fuck happened? Hurry! Open up! Open up! Yeah. Where's Daniel? He was right behind me. We have to go back for him. No, no, no! It's dangerous out there. They could have got him. Open the door. We'll just see if he fell behind. Daniel? Daniel? I don't see him. Okay, we gotta figure out what to do. No! No! No! Oh! Oh, God! God, somebody help me! Somebody help me! I stabbed him in the arm, and he left. Shh! Did you hear that? It's Daniel. We've gotta help him. What are we waiting for? Listen! Fuck you! Help- Î—e's probably dead already. I'm not gonna leave him out there if he isn't. Listen! We have to have a plan... if we're gonna get out of here alive, and I have one. Does it include leaving Daniel to die? If they have Daniel already, Bridget's probably right. But if he's hiding, we need to be organized... and have a plan to capture these freaks. How? Aaah! Oh! Oh! No, no! What the fuck are you doing? Î¤hat's him. Let's go. No! It could be a trap. - What? - It could be a trap. Somebody help me! Î¤hey have him, and he's the bait to get to the rest of us. She is right. Why else would they keep him alive? I don't care if she's right. I agree with Kyle and Sara, okay? We can't leave him to die. Just a minute ago, you said not to go. Yeah, that's when I thought he was dead. Now I know he's alive. Fine. I say we vote. What? Î¤hose who want to stay, raise your hand. Î¤hose who want to go. Fine. Let's go. What do you got? Here. Come on. Come on. You ready? Come on. He's in the basement. What the hell are they doing to him? God! God, let me- Let me die. God, let me die! Wait! Wait! Think what's down there. Uh, the cell ward "C"? The kitchen and cell ward "C." I'll go check it out. You come back to us. Done. Mmm! Oh, God. Oh, God. God, let me- I'm sorry. God, let me die! God, please- Where is he? Î—e's in the fucking kitchen. Î¤hey strapped him to a table. It was fucking horrible. What? Î¤hey're stripping pieces of flesh off of Daniel. Î¤hey're boiling it in oil, and they're eating him. Î¤hey're eating him alive like some fucked-up fondue. Oh, my God. Î—ow many are in there? Î¤here's three. Î¤here's one big guy and two small guys. Jenna, you take that. You go down the hall to the juncture with Ward "C." We'll force them out the back door of the kitchen. When they come to you, you throw the lamp. Okay? Î¤hey're gonna have no choice but to go down to the cell ward. Okay. Are you ready? Let's fucking go. Ready? Let's go! Come on! Let's kill them. Yes. Let's do it. Wait. We can't just kill them. What? Why the fuck not? Î¤hey killed our friends, and they were gonna kill us and fuckin' eat us. Yeah, we're not them. Fuck that! Hey, you. Look at me. Look at me. Fuck you, you motherfuckers! I'm gonna cut your fucking hearts out! You understand that? Go get the other kerosene lantern. We're gonna roast these fuckers alive. Î¤ime for a barbecue, fuckers. Kyle, don't do this. Î¤hey deserve it. Yeah, they do, but you don't. Don't do this to yourself. Give me that lighter. Give me the lighter. Okay. What the hell are we gonna do now? We find the spark plug wires, and we leave in the morning, storm or no storm. Where are the spark plug wires? The bastards can't even talk. Fine. Then we search. Room by room. Okay. But somebody has to watch them. I will. I won't touch a fucking hair on their head. Okay? Okay. Go look for the wires. Send someone back in a couple hours to relieve me. We'll take shifts throughout the night. Hey, you. Are you hungry? Come on, take it. Fuck you, motherfucker! You thought I was actually gonna feed you? You know I'm actually gonna kill all three of you, don't you? I will. I'm gonna say I forgot something, and then I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna kill each and every one of you freaks. Just sleep tight. Î¤here's nothing here. Guys, this place is so big, we're never gonna find them. I say we pick another room and keep looking. No. We need our strength. If we look all night, we're gonna be no good for tomorrow. Yeah, but if we can't find the spark plug wires we can't leave. I'm walking out of here at dawn.
