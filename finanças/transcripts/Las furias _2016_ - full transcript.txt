Come on, María. Grandad is waiting for you. Come on, sweetie. Hello, María. Uncle Aki, you were great. Really? Did you recognize me out there? You were great, brother. When you said, "Oedipus speaks," I got goose bumps. -You have an eye for recognizing art. -Uncle Héctor and Aunt Ana… -Hello, María. -Hello. Gran, all dressed up and pretty… -Here he is. Bravo! -Bravo! Bravo! Hey, let me through, let me through. Were you nervous, Grandad? No, I knew that if things went wrong, you could stand in for me. Give it to me, I'll film you with Grandad. She knows all the lines by heart. And not just the script. María, tell everyone about the Furies. Dad, when she wakes up tonight with nightmares, I'll call you to come and calm her down. Listen closely, Aki, she knows it better than you do. Gaia, Goddess of the Earth, was so sick of her husband, Uranus, God of the Heavens, bothering her night and day, that she gave Cronos, one of their sons, a sickle to cut off his father's… balls! Testicles, sweetie. Leave the girl. Carry on, darling. Drops of blood from the wound fell onto Mother Earth, giving birth -to the Furies. -Tisiphone… Tisiphone, Alecto and Megaera. Dog heads. Bat wings and snakes instead of… hair. Get off, Grandad. Do the Furies exist? No, the Furies don't exist. Of course they exist. When someone does something to harm the family, they enter their minds like poison forcing them to atone for their guilt or driving them insane. That's why we have to be very careful about how we treat each other. It will always haunt you. CASSANDRA & AKI ARE BORN FIRST SUCCESSES MARGA AND LEO'S FIRST SPLIT MARGA AND LEO'S MARRIAGE HÉCTOR IS BORN PROFESSIONAL PROJECTS Step by step. Step by step. -Already? -Yes. Already. Marga, come on. I can't, Julia. I can't take anymore. I can't even open this. What are you…? Talking isn't so hard It's basic but it's good. Said she who listens to that shit. Breathe to calm the anger. Visualize your daughter. Visualize the conversation you need to have. It's a coincidence, I swear. Visualize how you want that conversation to end, and what you can do to make it end that way. And remember… Talking isn't so hard Marga, come back. We have more calls coming in to Cassandra's Viewpoint. I'll address your comments, doubts or troubles and anything else you'd like to share with me through our website: BITTER I once told you that the words we choose to define ourselves are very important. "Bitter" is not a good choice, not even as a pseudonym, my friend. It wasn't my idea. That's what my daughter calls me. Do you think she might have a reason? I'm sure. Our reasons for doing things are as limitless as our imagination. -That doesn't make them true. -Marga. "Your truth? No. The truth. And join me in searching for it. Keep your truth to yourself," is what Machado would say. It's hard for her to meet up for coffee, let alone come with me in search of the truth. What happened between you that caused you to drift so far apart? Life, which is no small thing. But I didn't call to talk about my daughter. It's my granddaughter. No, stop. You aren't one of those grandmothers who use their granddaughters to fix the mistakes they made with their daughters, are you? I'm a grandmother who can see that her daughter is making a dangerous mistake with her own. -Stop. -No. Cassandra? Cassandra? I'm here. So what is this big mistake you think your daughter is making -with your granddaughter? -My granddaughter had a psychotic episode but she's fine now. It's under control, with medication, and she feels the need to take control of her life again. I understand that her mother is afraid, but treating her like an invalid won't do her any good. You sound like an expert on the subject. -I know a bit. -Your daughter doesn't? She does too. But… It's late, I won't make it on time. I'm sure our listeners don't know as much about these episodes as you seem to. Before judging I'd like to give everybody an idea of what a mother, in this case your daughter, may have gone through. I'm sure people can imagine. I'm sure they can't. It's true that psychotic episodes are becoming more frequent in such a stressful society like ours, but people who haven't experienced them can't imagine what goes on. Because you have to be there… to see your daughter… completely lose control of herself and put her life in danger. You have to be there when a mother sees in her daughter's eyes unfathomable terror. You have to be there when your daughter looks at you like you're her worst enemy, and as hard as you try, you can't reach her. You have to be there. Cassandra. And now for a bit of music before the next call. Bitch. Hi, Héctor, it's me. I let María go for a walk. She said she might stop by your office. Give me a call if she's there. I'm a bit worried. Okay? Bye. Leo? Leo! -María. -Are you okay? -María. -Honey, we're here. -It's over. -What is it? They've… They've robbed me. It's okay, it's over. -My headphones. -Let's go home. María, let's go home. She's wrong about María. And you suddenly felt the need to tell her, along with all of her listeners? Talking isn't so hard… I know you're scared about tomorrow but what you just did isn't the best way of facing it. Or maybe you're doing all you can to get out of it. Is that your diagnosis, doctor? No, it's not. But we can turn this into a professional diagnosis. It's perfectly clear to me. I didn't ask you for any of this. I'm not doing it because I've been asked to. I'm 65 years old. I think I can do what I want without having to ask anyone for permission. I've witnessed all my children's bad decisions, not being able to say a word. Are you comparing me to the bad decisions your children have made? Julia… I won't make it. No… It's late. I won't make it. Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! -Dad! -I won't make it. Leo! It's late, I won't make it. It's okay, Dad. There's no show. It's okay. He escaped on me. Can you tell me what's so funny, please? María? -María, what's wrong? -Nothing. I went out for a walk and saw auntie and uncle. -Alone? Where? -Yes. -What's gotten into you? -Nothing. -Nothing happened. -María! The doctor said to take it easy until you finish your medication. -Heck, Mum. -Did only I listen? Cassandra, calm down. Nothing happened. -Something could have! -But it didn't. Héctor, we'll see you tomorrow at Mum's. Thanks for bringing her. -Cassandra. -Tomorrow. -Tomorrow! -"Tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, -signifying nothing." -"Signifying nothing." Magnificent, Dad. You gave me goose bumps. Go for a drink. We'll stay with Dad and María. I don't need anyone to stay with me. -Thanks for bringing her. See you. -Alright. Go home with your grandad. Dinner is ready. -I was fine, Dad. -I know. I know. Go on. We'll be right there. Your sister is a bit overwhelmed by it all. Things will get better as soon as Gus finds work. I hope so. I don't think it helps your niece having her mother… She looks better. A little nudge and things will fall back into place, you'll see. What? Nothing. It's amazing how the same genes and environment can produce such different people. You make me feel like I'm in a National Geographic documentary. The Ponte Alegre adult male, a handsome, dominant specimen, pounces upon the female. -You're a clown. -It's in my genes. Your family genetics is pure drama, dear. The Ponte Alegres? -The Ponte Alegres. -It could be worse. I had a classmate at school whose name was Jack Knob. The poor lad spent his school days trying to honor his surname. Come on. They should have named you after comedians to honor your surname. My dad always said comedians were audience favorites, but nobody took them seriously. -What was he reciting? -Macbeth. How can he remember the lines? He doesn't even know who he is. "…to the last syllable of recorded time." -Will you tell them tomorrow? -Who? My mother and Cassandra? Over my dead body. Come on, Cass. The kid needs to try and take control again. She's taking less medication. We know the symptoms, she's sleeping well. I think-- What? Are you doing a degree in Psychiatry now you have free time? You must be starving. What do you fancy? I've made croquettes. Or how about some cold gazpacho? What do you fancy? What do I fancy? What do I fancy? I fancy getting separated. Let's go home. Cass, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me you said it because you're tired. -I'm not going anywhere until-- -Very tired, Gus. Extremely tired. Extremely. So tired… of everything. I don't want to talk. Just give me the pills. -And be drugged for the rest of your life? -Yes. The rest of my life. The rest… The refurbishment must have cost a fortune. Wait till you see her. I think she seized the opportunity and had a face lift. Please. -I just regressed back to my childhood. -Childhood? When mum started you already had a few grey hairs, mate. Seems like another lifetime. It was another lifetime. Shut up, I can't hear. Talking keeps us organized, makes us question ourselves, find new perspectives to determine what is causing us pain and how to alleviate it. When I listen to Mum talking to her patients it reminds me of Mari Carmen and her dolls. It's impossible for her to speak in such an understanding, intimate tone. There must be someone behind her doing the voices. Pills… Do you really think it will do any good -talking about my life at this stage? -At what stage? The stage where we know that what we're doing is completely absurd. Why do you think it's absurd trying to--? What? You're as old as I am. And you know. Why talk? We'll just sit quiet until my time is up. I come here because my daughter insists. She's a pain. I don't want to talk. I don't want to, I just want the pills and you to shut up. -Quiet. -She'll catch you. You should know better than anyone those conversations are private. It's part of my therapy. Listening to my mum's sessions is my only way of knowing that she can empathize with others. Only when they pay me. Goodbye. Julia, don't go. I've got patients, Marga. Calm down, everything will be fine. Bye. -Interesting show last night. -Yeah? -I missed it. -You didn't miss anything. Some delirious old woman. Spit it out, Mum. I must dash. -Mum, I have to go to the radio station. -Yes, right. Well… What I wanted to say… -Mum, I'm starting to get worried. -Are you ill? -Do I look ill? -No, you look wonderful. -Thank you. -A bit weird. Say what you have to say. I don't know how. I wanted to tell you… I'm… -I'm going to sell Alegre Manor. -What? -What? Why? -Because it's mine. Because I can. -And I need the money. -It's ours and Dad's too. No, I inherited that house directly from my father. There was no question whose it was when we separated. Aki is living there now. Have you talked to him? His phone isn't working. We go there every summer. I'm closing my practice and I want to travel. I need money. A bit late to see the world, isn't it? Just what I needed. You'll share the money, won't you? Of course. Actually, no, I won't. I just wanted you to know. It's part of our lives. We grew up in that house. -What are you doing? -It's done, Cassandra. Travel where? With who? You can't do this without an explanation. I have to give explanations to you? Are you seeing someone? -That would be the last straw. -Why the last straw? -Are you seeing someone? -No… -It's none of your business. -What? What's none of my business? Wait, Mum. Mum, don't leave me mid-sentence. I don't wish to talk, Cassandra. I need an explanation, please. If your mum can't pay me, I'll charge her less for the classes. -You have talent, lad. -I can't play any songs. Talent is one thing, using it is another. That's what we need to work on. -I prefer football. -Right. My mum says I can't do both. Look, here's what we'll do: I'll teach you for free. When your mum hears you play a song she'll find the money to let you play. I don't like it much. You love playing the guitar, Alvarito. No. The guy at the unemployment office is right. I need to retrain. Make the most of it if you want me to change as a father. If I can stop being a musician, I can become a different father. -I've been doing it for less time. -No, Dad. It's all right, sweetie. Don't worry about anything, honestly. -Is something wrong? -Don't worry. What's wrong? Hi. No, nothing is wrong. Everything is fine, isn't it? Sit down, please. I have to talk to you. Sweetie, it's okay. Dad and I-- Let me talk, Mum. Without interrupting, please. -I'm okay. -Yes. Dad. What happened to me has been hard for everyone, but it's over. I take my medication, I go to my sessions and I feel I'm back in control again. -Yes, darling. -Let me, Mum. But I'll never be in control if you don't give me a little space. -All we want-- -Listen to me! I need space and you do too. You'll never find another job if you're always looking after me. -It's not your fault. -It is. At least partly. -I-- -I know it's hard to find work but you stay at home because of me. -María, it isn't your fault. -I'm okay. Dad, you're not focusing on what you need to. And you, Mum, are focused on something you shouldn't be. I'm the same as always. From home to work, and back home. You waste some time along the way. -I don't know what you mean. -Yes, you do. And I know it's my fault. You must understand, I'm fine. You can stop doing things that I don't need. -I don't know what you're on about. -Heck, Mum, don't make this harder. I know what I saw and you know what you're doing. -I don't want to talk about that. -What did you see? You've seen things that aren't-- -Sure, I'm mad, I'm hallucinating… -I didn't say that. Yes, you did. But that's not the point. -What did you see? -That's not the point. I'm okay. -It doesn't look like it. -Mum. You two don't look okay, but you keep saying you are. I'm okay. With who? Dad or the guy at work? That's not what I want to talk about. -Hi. -Hi. I haven't much time. How about lunch in the cafeteria? Dry, frozen fish. Yummy. I prefer a sandwich in the park. What did your mum want? To tell us she's selling Alegre Manor. Why? She wants to retire and travel… What did you say? What could I say? It's her house. I said that before she hands over the keys, maybe we could all spend a weekend there and you and I could get married then. -At the house? -At the house. -With everyone there? -Everyone there. -You mean a real wedding? -A real wedding. -Not what we had planned. -Yeah. Well, okay. -Okay? -What? Nothing. Okay? Okay, then. -Why are you saying it like that? -Like what? We said "okay". Isn't my "okay" okay? Héctor. I can say okay because you're an asshole but after 20 years you're my asshole. I understand you want to marry at the house, even more so now your mum has decided to sell it at her own risk. But don't expect my father to come. He's too old to travel and contact with your wacky family might bust his four bypasses. Can we go for lunch now? I have a colonoscopy at four o'clock. -A colonoscopy? -Yes. God, you've turned me on. We had a big argument. Maybe he felt threatened because… You won't believe it, Cassandra. You won't believe it. It was nice and slow at first but then things got going and it was amazing! And then… well… Anyway, if that's what it's like when we settle a quarrel… Time for a commercial break. Gus. Cassandra? What? What are you saying? Is anyone there? I don't know what you said. He said he never thought he could stop loving you, but from now on he'll do all he can to learn how. Gus. Gus, please. I'm going to the wedding because your brother is my best friend. I can't move out yet but I will as soon as I can. Until then, stay away from me. -It was a mistake. -I don't want to hear it, dammit. I don't want to know. I don't want to see you. I don't love you. Hello? Hello. Hello. Didn't you hear me? Hadn't we arranged to have dinner together? Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I got held up. I met some friends and… It was more fun than having dinner with Gran. Well, I see your meeting with your children went well. If you'd been here you'd know. -I had patients, Marga. -Yes. I don't know if it makes much sense to retire so I can travel with my partner when my partner has so much work to do. Your partner isn't old enough to retire. -Right. -And she didn't ask you to retire, or to tell your kids anything you don't want to. All your partner wants is for you to decide what makes you happy. I couldn't. They made me feel as though I were seven. Look, I think it's best… if you call them tomorrow, they come over again, we'll leave the door open and they can catch us at it, like mad. I'd pay to see your daughter's face. I told them I'm selling Alegre Manor. What? It's all I could think of when I couldn't… When my daughter started talking, I stuck to my guns. No, the Ponte Alegre spirit? Suddenly Héctor, I don't know if it was because I'm selling, proposed going together one weekend to celebrate his wedding there. -His wedding? -Yes, they're getting married. What a mess you made. I can't leave you alone. No. No. Why don't you come with me? As your assistant? As… As… I'm not going to lie. -No. -Julia, please. I have enough problems as it is. No. If I go, it's as your partner, which is what I am. Or I'll stay at home. Please, come with me. You go ahead if you like. -I'll park over there. -Okay. Never leave the house! Good to see you too. -You look like you were shipwrecked. -I was. Have a shower. Take this off. I remember you more handsome. This family has never had a good memory. Mum, I'm sorry what I said over the phone. And about the nasty things you wrote in the chapter you sent? Are you asking me if I meant them or if I regret writing them? How's the book going? Like the family I'm writing about. Hard work. Help Julia with the luggage. -Julia? -My assistant. Is she pretty? Yes. Me and two more. Two more, seriously. -This is a pigsty. -I only do spiritual cleaning. If I'd met a psychologist like you, -I wouldn't have quit psychoanalysis. -Quit? -You never started, honey. -Really? Then it must have been you practicing on me. It was like torture. Never trust the memory of a Ponte Alegre. -It's one of our weak spots. -Not the Alegres'. That's from your father. You're right, Mother, you never forget. And I thought this family reunion was going to be a nightmare. -Where shall I put this? -In my room. I'll show you. This house is complicated. That way. That must be Cassandra. Is she bringing Dad? -Haven't you seen him for a long time? -Very long. Okay, go boost your self-esteem. This way, up the stairs. -Shall I carry your suitcase? -No, it's okay, thanks. -I can take two. -I'm okay. -Sure? -Yes. -Hi, Gus. How was your trip? -Unforgettable. Is something wrong? Life, which is no small thing. Are you really selling it? You came too! Great! You're becoming more indispensable by the day, aren't you? Journeys really disorientate him, but he remembers you, Gran, don't you? The house might bring back memories. Why are you selling it? Grandad needs things to be familiar. I ruined everything. Gran, Mum and Dad are getting separated because of me. María… Listen, your mum and dad are adults. Whatever happens between them is not your fault. Stop crying. We have a lot to do. Remember the first time we came here together? You know, I'm glad you're mad at me. Yeah? Sure. I was worried all this time I was living with a zombie. -Who's here? -Hello. Honey! -Darling. -Matey. Hell, man. You stink of a farm. I live in contact with nature. You're almost covered in it, you dirty pig. -What? -I'll get the rest of our luggage. Right. Are you guys okay? Gus and me? Yeah. Well, we're not having our best moment. I want none of that. -I love your husband. -Yes, he should have married you, -or Héctor. -Héctor? He's closer to me. Sure. That's why you haven't called him since you came. -I've been focused on my book. -That's another thing. Don't even mention me, Aquiles. Like it or not, you're a Ponte Alegre. I have to tell the truth, the whole truth, -and nothing but the truth. -You're right. I'm dying to read the chapter where the famous actor's youngest son tries following his father's footsteps, but ends up in the family home writing his father's biography. I'll try to overlap it with a funny chapter so it doesn't coincide with the only daughter who, after trying to follow in her brilliant mother's footsteps, -ends up doing horoscopes on the radio. -I don't do horoscopes. Watch it, you love getting your fists out. It will be hard to find the funny chapter. Not really, from a distance, tragedies can be really funny. We've had great moments in this house. I can't believe she's selling it. Héctor says there's no stopping her. He doesn't give a shit. He's bloody loaded. I don't even have… There he is. -Hello. -I think we have… How are you, Marga? The Trojan prince. Come on. -Come here. -Don't touch me, get off. Do you remember the stage we set up there, in the garden, for my birthday? The mad king and his buffoon. Watch that hand. -My favorite niece! -Uncle Aki. My treasure. -I'm your only niece. -One of a kind. I've heard you've even developed superpowers. I'm the gill-man and you're the water nymph. Mad… but powerful. Leonardo Ponte. He doesn't know who I am. Your grandfather is living proof that the face is the window to the soul. The shit has vanished, -he even looks like a nice guy. -María, let's greet uncle Héctor. "Distinguished court of Poland witnesses of these astonishing events, listen to thy prince." Bravo! Bravo, Dad! -Bravo, what an actor! -Bravo! Bravo, Leo! -Shall I go to the same room as always? -Yes. Héctor… Héctor. My Trojan prince. We're home. We're home. Come on. -The Marian assembly hall. -No! No, please! Yes, the Marian assembly hall. The crowd goes wild with… Rock Machine! Gus, on the guitar, yours truly on the drums, and lead singer, Aquiles Ponte Alegre. During the silence, just when I was about to sing, my dad showed up and ruined everything. The doors open and the renowned actor walks in. Logically, everyone looks at him, and instead of keeping quiet he says, "No, please, you should be watching my son tonight." Come on, Aki. Get your own back now. What a surprise! Neka! Nekane! -Well, you're… -Totally pregnant. María! Darling, what a surprise! -I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. -I don't. Who's the father then? -Aki, I don't believe it. -Uncle! Come on! We've done nothing in 20 years. Absolutely nothing. It's my kid. I got inseminated. You look gorgeous. It's great to see you. Great to see you too. Darling. I'm pleased I'm conducting the service. The pleasure is ours, councilwoman. Come to the town hall for the paperwork tomorrow. We will. -I used to love that song. -They all did. See how Cassandra looks at him. Gus. Gus, please. That's enough. You have to understand. It meant nothing. Gus and Cassandra. Cassandra and Gus. Their whole lives together and still sneaking away to be alone. -Héctor. -I love you guys! Please! -I love you. -They know, Héctor. Knowing isn't enough. -You have to remember it and celebrate it. -Right. I love you guys loads, both of you. Kiss each other so my future wife sees how you love each other after so long. -We've been together almost as long. -Not officially. We only had one foot in. They show commitment. Give each other a kiss! -Héctor, go to bed. -Kiss each other. Kiss her, dammit! Please, leave me alone, dammit! Héctor. These are the remains of Héctor Ponte Alegre. Love each other, guys. Love each other now. Because this is what we really are. Right, fine. Let's get to bed, honey. -Yes, go on. -You'll have a hangover tomorrow. Leave this mess, come on, -I'll help clean up. -Don't worry, I'll do it. -Shall I help? -Yes, please. Thanks. María, why don't you clear the table? -Yeah, I'll help Mum to wash the dishes. -Please. -What? -We're fine, sweetie. Really, we're fine. I'm forty-five years old, and here I am sitting between Mum and Dad, like when I wasn't allowed to get up from the table until I'd finished dinner. You can get up when you like. Don't you care about me eating right anymore? -Is your assistant seeing anyone? -Yes. Well, I'm not the jealous type. Her partner is. Very much so. Bad move. He'll soon lose her. Said the expert. I am an expert! At screwing up relationships. Like all the Ponte Alegres. Your brother and sister have been faithful for over 20 years. Because Gus and Ana are headstrong. But Cassandra isn't and Héctor isn't either. They're like us. What do you mean, like us? The Ponte Alegres. An imperative that counts only on oneself to perform. -Aki, no, please. -No, it bores me too. I've delved so much for the book that… All I want now is to get rich and then end up like Dad. Right, champ? Live to forget. I'm going to chat up your assistant, to make me feel less homesick and cheer me up. You're so lucky you're not here to see your biggest failure in life. If only you had the slightest trace of memory to… Grandad, what's happening? Eh? What's happening? THE TALENT ABANDONS LEO PONTE We can auction off all the antiques. -Cass. -What about the Chillida? Your father sold it more than ten years ago to do Oedipus, behind my back. When I didn't let him mortgage this house. Who would have thought? "Leo, this is the family home! We can't risk losing it!" Home. -Cass, can we leave this? -No. It has to be done while we're all here. I don't want any more surprises. -There's no rush. -No rush? Weren't you eager to go on your mysterious trip? -Cass. -Cass. Aren't you going to tell us what this is all about? Before a trip, you don't ask why, you ask where, who with. Let's carry on. No, let's sort this out. I want the desk in the office, Gus has always really liked it, -haven't you? -I don't want anything. Hello. -Where were you? -Running on the beach. You can't skip your medication. I haven't, Mum. -Have you changed Grandad? -No, I forgot with all this farce. First things first. Come on, Grandad, I'll change your nappy. Where's the silverware? -It should be there. -No, it isn't here. Son of a bitch! That's me, and I've nothing to do with it. Aki! He'll come up with an excuse to justify selling the silverware. You're like little kids. "Héctor, the great horse tamer. Cassandra, who can see into the future. And Achilles, master of eternal glory. Great names for human beings destined for greatness." Look… You may all be on holiday having a good time, but I have work to do, you know? So, would you mind fucking off, please? Sorry. That goes for you too, Water Nymph. Out. THE FURIES Aquiles, we're late. If you examine carefully any family history, you're sure to find some episode which can only be explained by the existence of these three daughters of… Uranus. The Furies are three bitches who show no compassion. Nor love or forgiveness. They feed on guilt and remorse. Only sacrifice appeases them. Of course if we had to kill an animal every time someone acts against the family, there wouldn't be a single living thing left on earth, right, María? -Right, María? -Wave. María. María. She can't have you slaving all day. I'm sure she tries, I know my mother. She needs to be stopped. Should we report her? No, Aki… This part of the coast -is amazing. -Amazing. Someone who knows it well should show it to you. -That someone is me. -Really, I can't, I have to… You've been warned about me, right? Sure, that must be it. Because your charm never fails you. -Never. -Never. So you can't say no. I'm going through a difficult, delicate time in my life. My self-esteem is rock bottom. As a therapist it's your obligation. Compulsive obsession isn't my specialty. What is? I'm sure to suffer from it. Julia. She's here, Mum. Doing the inventory of the house. Let's carry on. The assistant turns you on. I turn the assistant on. What's up between you both? Nothing. Life is about change. We are mutants Until the final hour -You were always a rotten singer. -What about you? -Me? -Why such a hurry to get married? -We've been together 20 years. -Exactly. We have assets, if anything happens one day… How romantic. Gus… Son of a bitch! I'm the king of the cliff! My ass. -I'm the king of the cliff! -Like hell, you are! I've got you. Stop! The shortcut doesn't count. -I'm the king! -The shortcut doesn't count. -I'm the king! -That doesn't count. I'm the king! No! -I'm the king! -Not if you take the shortcut. See? The only rule in his life: No shortcuts if you want to be king. -You aren't the king. -I am the king. I'm the king. -I'm the king. -No, you aren't the king. You aren't the king, asshole. -I am the king! -No, you aren't. -I am the king! -You aren't! -What the hell? If you take the shortcut, you're not king. Some things never change. Everything changes, Héctor, whether we like it or not. Almost always for the worse. I'm sorry, it's my family. Accept this genocide and rest. Shit! Héctor, what are you doing? Héctor, no! Héctor, no! Héctor… Héctor, you're hurting me! You're hurting me! It hurts. Héctor. Héctor. I'll take a walk to digest lunch. -I'll go with you. -I'd rather go alone. I'm sorry. I need a volunteer. Come. I'm sorry. It's beautiful. If someone like you is just an assistant, all I can aspire to is being an assistant's assistant. Aki, no. Really. I can't… I just want to take a stroll. I'm not proposing marriage. -Yes, but… -Look, I don't need any explanations. The job market is terrible, I understand that. Working for a professional like my mother is important to you. Though I warn you, when you give it up, you'll be the one needing psychiatric therapy. No, your mum isn't like that. Trust me. I've been with her longer than you. Besides, she doesn't have to know. Look, let's leave these bags here… -and we'll sneak off. -I can't. Really, Aki. I can't. -Heck. -What's the matter? Sorry. I suffer from Stendhal Syndrome, I faint in the presence of beauty. What's this? We're taking a stroll. Bye, Mum. -Shall we? -No, I can't. I'm sure my mother can do without you for a while, -Can't you, Mum? -No. I can't do without her. Not even for a short while. Let's go inside. Yes, let's. Aki… Marga. Marga, wait. Marga. Marga, wait, please. It's okay. It had to happen. It wasn't the best way but you can talk now. You have the chance to talk to them. -I can't. -It's done, Marga. -I saw myself in his eyes. -What did you see? Myself. Marga, that's enough. Look into my eyes. What do you see? It's a mirage, Julia. A mistake. No. I can't… Marga, now is when you should be ashamed. Now you're like a silly old woman. "Rain, I accuse you of ingratitude! Never did I give you a king! Nor did I call you daughter! This storms my spirit, taking away my feelings. Only what remains in my heart. Filial ungratefulness. Your old father, generous, gave you everything from the bottom of his heart. They don't love me. They don't love me. They don't love me." Dad, let's go home. We need to settle this. -Not now. -Now. I have plans too, you know? I want to be free too. I don't care about anything either. -Cassandra! -What? Have you done anything to stop this, to stop her from destroying what little is left of this family? -Why is Dad like that? -I didn't let him go out on his own! Hey, that's enough, okay? I don't give a damn. What have you done besides complaining and making Gus' life miserable? That's something you can't really judge. Gus, please, the prince has an opinion on everything. Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. -How much will you make on the sale? -No, I told you… How much will you make? I bet you organized this? -No! -Please! María. -María. -What's up? -María! -What is it? No! -No! -María. -María, what has happened? -What's wrong? -Calm down. -It's only mud. María, darling, calm down. I found her in the pigsty trying to attack a big pig with a butter knife. Calm down, love. -She's killed a hen too. -María. Look at me, darling. Girl. -Girl-- -Come on, Dad. It's them. It's them. Mum, it's the Furies. We've done our share to piss them off, haven't we, Mum? -Bloody hell! -No! No! Dad, don't go! -María, please! -No! María, that's enough. Listen to me, sweetheart. Listen, love. The Furies don't exist and you know it. -Try hard. -Yes. They don't exist. Listen, they don't exist. -You know they don't exist. -Yes they do! No, it's one of your grandad's stories. They don't exist. -They do exist, Mum. -They don't. Can't you see what they're doing to you? Can't you see? It's alright. Everything's alright. Hey! Hello, princess. Hey, will you marry me? You know what I just remembered? The day you were born. I held you in the hospital, you opened your eyes and gazed at me. Your eyes open like they are now. I said to your mum, "This girl knows things." Hey, no. No. Today, your ears are closed for celebration. There's only one soundtrack today. Marga? Marga? Marga. Hello, Leo. Where is Marga? She's gone. Did you sleep with him often? One wasn't too many? More than five? At home? No. -Did you like his cock? -Please. Did he eat your pussy? You must learn to do it yourself. Dammit, Héctor. Hello, Gus. -Nekane! You look gorgeous. -And fat. -Is your brother upstairs? -I don't know. -Can we talk a second? -I'm saying nothing apart from… I was looking for you. You might find me. When you have to move out, if you have no place to go, you can stay at my house. I'll stay at my mum's until the baby's a bit older. My house is quiet too and you can write and… Out hunting a father for your child? You think I'd want a father like you for my child? You look lovely. It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. Who says it brings bad luck? Who? I'll beat them up until they're bloody unrecognizable. Hey, who said so? Come forward, doomsayer! Look how smart I am. Some can't see how lucky they are. I look at you and I see it. I won't stop looking at you all day. All day. I'll look at you all day. All day looking at you. Héctor. Héctor. -I thought it was your brother. -I always disappoint you. Aki… -Don't you get dressed together? -Aki… Women love doing that, don't they? Aki… -Or does that change when… -Aki! Marga. "Mum" is hard to say. I get this image in my head and I just… I'll get dressed up. Marga, is this a recent discovery or has it been all your life? It's made me rethink our entire family history. Your brother is getting married. All I'm asking… Don't ask anything. I don't care about the wedding, I don't give a shit about my brother or you. Think twice about selling the house. The sale of the house has caused all this. I swear, if I have to move out of this house, I'll spread the news about you and Julia… I don't care, son. Really, Marga? I can see it now: famous actor's ex-wife turns lesbian shacking up with a girl who could be her daughter. I'll be loaded with this story. Let's begin. Here present are Héctor Ponte Alegre and Ana Luisa Herrera Martín, to join together in civil matrimony. All legal prerequisites have been met for the celebration of this civil marriage, and no lawful impediment has been presented. Cassandra has asked to say a few words. I'm not sure what to say now. Right… Well… What can I say that you don't already know? You've been together so long. As long as Gus and me. A lifetime. It's just that sometimes… things become unclear, and things you think you know, suddenly they… Well… Sometimes you get angry because you think everyone else can't see it. As if you were in an enclosed space with everyone shouting and you shouting even louder. You end up not hearing your own voice. And you shout so loud until… I love you so much, María. I hope you are as happy as I have been. I hope you never forget the good things. Please. And I hope… if you ever screw up really, really badly… you can forgive and carry on. And you can… Well, I don't know. This is Cassandra's Viewpoint on 81,5 FM. Talking is so hard Thank you, Cassandra. -Let's continue. -One moment, Your Honor. I'd like my say too. Well, if I may. The family is a strange unit, isn't it? We're not even allowed to choose the clan we belong to, which makes us victims of sheer chance. We'd like to get married before dark. I'll get to the point. Nobody picks their family. People who say, "My family are my friends," are lying. If a brother were the same as a friend, we wouldn't use two words to define them. When a friend is a really good friend, we call him "brother", -to highlight that-- -Aki. Nearly done. You can get rid of a friend quite easily. But getting rid of a father, or a mother, a sister or a brother, that's a tragedy. Family is family. You have to take what comes and balance between the Furies and love. If we think love exists, why won't the Furies exist? Aki, don't get into that. There's proof of their existence. Great. Profound and brief, as always. -Thank you, brother. -I haven't finished. Today we're here to celebrate love. Therefore, I take this opportunity to welcome into our family a new member. Mum can't bring herself to make the official introduction, but I think we'd better not put it off any longer, when her presence will change our future drastically. Your brother wants to get married. I want to live my life. If you want to live here, I'm sure we can… I'm sure. I don't want to hear this. -I do. -It's my wedding. -Don't let him do this. -Julia, please. What's going on? Mum will explain. -Can we carry on? -Marga. -No. -You're pathetic, you have no right. -Julia. -What? I won't let anyone, not even your moron son, turn our relationship into something filthy. Voilà. You're scum. You're scum. You're scum, you hear? Scum. There's still time to celebrate a double wedding! -Shut the fuck up! -Héctor! -Héctor, no! -Come here! If you touch me again, I'll smash your face in. Fucking brat. I'll kill you! Don't worry, I'm dying already. A galloping cancer. Hence the hurry for this bloody ceremony. Look at me. Just at me. Just me. Like there's nobody else on Earth, look at me. Can we continue, please? Can we finish? Let's go straight to the "I do" part, please. Will you start the dance? Of course. Let's keep the tradition. We needn't stay here. Get your things, we'll go to the hotel. Will you refuse me a dance on your wedding day? Right, it's time… to consummate this marriage. But the party isn't over. Keep on celebrating on our behalf. Bitches. Driving us crazy isn't enough. They want a human sacrifice. Thank you. Here and now… I love you more than anyone. And I feel like the luckiest man in the world. Here and now… I have a huge hard on. As my wife, you should do something about it. Did you know? How is María? I don't know. I upped her dosage a bit. Good. Have you been together long? -Over a year. -That long? Well, I'm sorry I didn't… Go after Gus. No. There's nothing I can do. Do you love your husband? Don't waste time. I'll look after María. He's dying, Leo. Our baby is dying. I need a hug so badly. -Gus. -It's over. It's all over. Everything. You love me. You love me. You've always loved me, you always will. Gus. Gus. Goddamn it, Gustavo! Stop. I love you. And you love me. I'm not moving until you say it. I swear, I won't move off this beach. You should have brought a warm coat. Go back to sleep, Grandad. It's early still. Go back to sleep. Héctor… Héctor? Héctor? You'll rub a hole in the marble. Marga. I don't want to pressure you. Or be a burden to you. I just want to be with you. I want to be with you. I want to be with you. Excuse me. Have you seen Dad or María? They aren't in their room or in the garden. I thought they were asleep. -María! -María? You can't come with me! No! Go home! Go back home, Grandad! No! I have to do what I have to do. You can't come with me! Go home! Go back! Go back home, Grandad! Go home! Go home! María! María! I can't find her anywhere! Gus went to the beach, they might be there. Aki! Aki! Héctor… Héctor… Héctor has gone. He left all his things on the table. He's going to… I know where he might be. See if María is on the beach. Cass! Cassandra! Cass! Cassandra! Cass! Aki! Aki! -Can you help Marga? -What's wrong? Héctor. Cass! Cassandra! Cassandra! Cass! Cass! -Cassandra! -What? If you stay still, the waves will carry you to the beach. Don't follow me. If you do, I don't care. And I don't care if you can't get back. It's all your fault! I forgot the ballast! No! You got me flustered on the beach and… How will I sink now? You've ruined everything, Grandad. Everything. They should take you! It's all your fault! It's all your fault! They should take you! They should take you! They're here. They're here. They're here. What a fright! I saw your clothes on the beach and I thought… Gus! Cassandra! Help! It's no big deal. Anyone can have a bad wedding night. You can't do this. You have no right. If you throw in the towel, what is left for me? What the hell are you doing? I've been copying you all my life. This isn't the worst idea I've ever copied. What can I do? My brother commits suicide, I don't have a penny to my name, my mother is shacked up with a hot chick that I could never dream of. I have to do it, Aki. I have to. I have to do it. A synchronized jump gets more points. I'm going to do it! I can't do it. I can't. I can't do it! When I start to run out of air, I float back up. Héctor! -That's enough, Héctor. -Stop! Stop! Bitches! Why do I have to do everything myself? There you are. There you are! Come and get me. Bitches! Come and get me! What are you doing? -What were you going to do? -Don't do this to me. Come and get me! Come and get me! -What the hell were you doing? -Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me! Let me go! It's Dad. -He disappeared this morning with María. -But she isn't in the boat. -I'll jump better than you. -Don't talk nonsense. Jump for fuck's sake. The girl! The girl! The girl! The girl! The girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! "What would you do for her? Cry, fight? Starve? Get torn apart? Drink vinegar? Eat a crocodile? I'll do everything. Or have you come to whine, pretending to be brave throwing yourself to your grave? If you want to be buried alive with her, I will too." Get hold of her! Pull her up! Pull her up! The rope! -María! -María! -María! -María… Come on, Cass. Please, don't die. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me, please. Don't do this. -Hurry up! -The boat won't go any faster. It's my bloody fault. Please, don't die. Please! María! -María! -María! Hey! What? -To the beach! -It's Ana. To the beach! The beach! Jump! Push! -Harder, come on. -Push! Héctor! -Get her out, help me. -Come on, quick. Ana! Gustavo! Gus! She's swallowed a lot of water. She's swallowed a lot of water. -Darling. -Oh my God. -Darling. -María. My love. It's coming. Go on. -We need to get her to a hospital. -The head is already out. Push, Nekane! Push! Push, Nekane! That's it, good. Push, Nekane! That's it. It's alright. That's it. He's gorgeous. My boy. How lovely. Yes. Give him a kiss.
