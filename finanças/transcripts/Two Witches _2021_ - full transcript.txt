OK, I'm done. Honey, we want the red, right? What? The wine. - We want the red, right? - You do. I can't. Oh, yeah. - Fuck, baby. I keep forgetting. - Hey, babe. Man! Alright, do we want Burgundy or Bordeaux? I don't know, I don't... I don't really know much about wine, so... Whatever sounds... good. - Are you guys ready to order? - Hi. Uh, can we get the...? The Browy? The Broge...? - The Brouilly. - The Brownie? Ha-ha! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's impossible to say. - Thank you. - I'll be right there. You OK, pumpkin? Sarah? Simon? Simon? Simon? Honey? Sarah? Why are you doing this in the dark, baby? I couldn't find the light. It's right here. - I wonder if she gave it to me. - What? Something about her look. The way she looked at me. Baby, come on. Don't go into this again. If you didn't react like this, I wouldn't feel this bad. You didn't get sick because some old lady looked at you. You vomited because you're pregnant. You're such a dick sometimes. Look, let's just be happy, alright? We're... we're having a baby. I'm having a baby. Jesus. Yeah, play that card. She gave me the evil eye. You're talking about the old bitch from the restaurant? Yeah. Ever since then, I've been feeling, like, this sickness, just, like, awful anxiety, and seeing things in my sleep. It makes perfect sense. You're expecting a child. Of course you're gonna feel out of sorts. Your mood's gonna be all over the place. - Your brain's gonna be all fucked up. - No, no, you're not... You're not listening. You don't always have to explain everything. You don't have to pretend you understand everything. Because you know what? You don't. You don't know how I feel. Alright, what's her address? - What? - This old bitch from the restaurant. Where does she live? I'm gonna go to the restaurant, ask what her name is. I'm gonna find her. I'm going to murder her for you. I'm going to rip both of her arms off and turn them into nunchuks, wrap them around her throat, and then, er... I'm going to demand that she stop giving out evil looks to my girl. You're such a dork. I'm serious. I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. Well, first you're gonna have to protect me from your friend Dustin. - Come on, man. - Yeah, he's... That guy is into some creepy shit, babe. You have to admit, he's, like... Yeah! Mel, check this out. It just came. Look at these real horns. Goat horns. Yes, Dustin, those are real horns. Babe, stop the car. Stop. Pull over. Wow. Hey, buddy. You're a beautiful guy. Or girl. - You OK? - God! Baby, I just saw a fucking coyote. Oh, my God, it looked right at me. What? You OK? I just saw a coyote. It was like this little, uh... Uh... Sort of like a... It was like a fox, but... Yeah, let's go. Speaking of grandpas and aches and pains, Dustin here used to have back problems. But, thanks to me, he doesn't anymore. It's true. She is a healer. She is a genius. She has... thousands of candles and plants. I mean, like, where do I begin? Uh... House Blessing, Kundalini Energy, uh, Self-Love... Like you need any more of that? Well, yeah... Hate Divider, Hate Separator, Stool, like, Softener. I've used it! And, no, she's great. She's great. She's got... What else does she have? She has Relaxation. Hate Avoider, Love Fix. That one you might actually need. - Thank you. - OK. Hey, that one might be true, alright. But you guys don't need that one. You look like you're two peas in a pod. Well, it only takes once to knock a girl up, so... Yes! Simon, I like her. Maybe we can get her a Positivity candle. Well, yeah... Whatever. Like you believe in any of this stuff. Simon is a skeptic. He doesn't believe in anything. It's true. In college, we took a Catholicism class. And he stands up on the first day mid-lecture and goes, "Death is the end no more!" And he slams his laptop down on the table, - shattering it and walked out. - Oh, my God! That was the biggest mistake of my life. I was also on LSD at the time. Alright, but, look... how about a "Help Me Believe In This Bullshit" candle? Oh, actually, that was my first candle. Ah, yes it was, and I think you're referring to, Simon, the Faith candle. How about a "People Are Watching Me" candle? Simon... Wait, what? - Nothing. - No, what is he talking about? Sarah is convinced that some old hag from the restaurant last week has been... stalking her and, um, spooking her, and staring at her. Stop it. Can you just stop? Wait, is he serious? Sarah? Is he serious? I've just been feeling sick and... anxious. - And... - You're being threatened? - Yeah. - OK. I mean, come on, guys. You're pregnant, baby! - Yeah, that's what I was thinking. - You keep saying that. Shut up! Seriously, shut the fuck up, both of you. Sarah, listen... I'm a professional. I am. I do this for a living. I've dealt with this kind of thing before, I can help you. I make my money by healing people and keeping them safe. There are a lot of jealous, evil, envious people out there. And I'm not surprised. You know what? Let's bust out the board. Yes! Ouija board time. I got a board online. It's fucking awesome. Let's take it on head-on, right? It's not, like, a Ouija board, it's just a Ouija board. - It's, like, you know... - And it's spelled with an 'O'. So, how does this work? It's called the ideomotor effect. We're all gonna move it, and we're gonna think somebody else did. Idiot monitor what? Ideomotor effect. It's a subconscious movement based on prior expectations. In other words... it's bullshit. OK, let's all hold hands. I want you all to focus on your candle. This is your spirit. It'll protect you from any ill will. Remember that when we lift the veil to the spiritual world, we need to seem united and strong. And do not mock, or invite anything from the beyond. Am I understood? Let's not forget our mission here. It's to simply help Sarah get rid of this negative energy and make her feel safe again. OK. Let's have some fun. Everybody put their hands on the planchette. Spirit, if you're here, make yourself known. Spirit, tell us the first letter of your name. Sarah. Why don't you say something? Um... Spirit... What do you want? Spirit, if you're harassing Sarah... tell us why. I feel it. I feel something. I feel... I feel the spirit. It's... It's over by the fridge cos it wants me to get another IPA cos I'm parched! Damn it. You fucking prick. OK. Oh, man! You should've seen your faces for a second. I guess no, uh... no other-realm touching tonight, but that's alright. - Let's, uh, wrap this up and, uh... - Goddamn it. You want another...? Another beer? Another beer? You're gonna be fine, Sarah. Just fine. Alright, alright. I want my money back. I'm sorry, guys. These boards are pretty much bullshit anyways. I'm kinda glad that they are. Well, I mean, they sell those things at Toys "R" Us, so don't expect much, right? I'm gonna go to bed, babe. You coming? Uh... I'll be right up. Dude, so great to see you, man. I'm so happy you came out, bro. Ditto. I've been trying to insist we come here for a long time now. You know what? Sarah's a great girl. She's just feeling a little... off her game. You know, she's not feeling too well. Oh, my God, dude. I gotta show you this new mask I just got. It's gonna fucking blow your mind. Goddamn, I miss you, man. Good luck cleaning up the mess, Melissa. Good luck with your relationship, Simon. Don't listen to her, man. You're fine. Yeah. Fuck it. "I'll tell you what to do." Fucking prick! Dustin. Dustin. Dustin! Aargh! - What the fuck? - Sarah's candle. It's completely out. - And? - So, ours aren't even halfway. I feel like something went wrong, baby. I feel like it went really, really wrong. I did something and now she's in danger and I gotta tell her. No, no, no. Don't do that. Seriously, chill out. We can tell 'em in the morning. The last thing we need to do is freak her out any more. You're gonna go and tell her some spirit has sucked her candle dry? It's never happened to me before, Dustin. I'm in the fucking dark. "I'm a professional. People pay me to do this. "Sarah, everything's gonna be fine. There's nothing to be afraid of." I don't know, it could have been more powerful than I thought. Um... I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I was wrong. I didn't think it was gonna dry out her candle. Jesus Christ, Melissa. Fuck you, Dustin! - Don't Jesus Christ me. You're the one... - Oh, what's up, Simon? Hey. - Hey, Simon. - What's up, man? Um, I'm gonna go to sleep. Hey, do you have a minute? I'd like to talk. No, no, no, no. She just wants you to clean up a bit more, bro. - I got it. - OK. Good night, guys. Good night, baby. If anything fucking happens, it's on you, Dustin. Oh, it's on me? No, this is on fucking you. Look at this shit! Oh... fuck. We have a situation. It's Sarah. Sarah? You OK? Honey? You're... really freaking me out. Sarah bear? We should call 911. Don't be ridiculous. It'll take 'em 20 minutes to get here. She's sleepwalking, man. She's never done anything like this before. - She could be having a seizure. - Oh, come on. - Sarah? - Don't fucking yell at her. The bed's still made. I don't think she ever went in the room. Sarah, you're really freaking me out here. Fucking shit! Have you ever walked in your sleep before? No. Have you ever suffered from, like, any sort of sleeping disorder, or...? Not that I know of. Except for sleeping with Simon. That's a disorder. What the fuck happened, guys? You had some sort of a bad dream. And you went walking in your sleep. We probably shouldn't have driven so far in your condition. I'm sorry. You were in the hallway for, like, three hours! - OK? You didn't even make it... - Stop it. We'll talk about this tomorrow. You can sleep on the couch if you want. Wait. What? No. Simon? You really don't remember anything? I remember walking in the hallway. And I was looking for the light. But I couldn't find it. - Alright. - We're gonna go to bed. What was she doing all that time in the dark? What do you mean? Like, what was she doing in the hallway? I don't know. Well, it's freaking me the fuck out, so... Yeah. I'm a little worried, actually, to be honest. Do you have your knife? Oh, I have it. OK, good, because when I need you to be a man, you need to be a man. What the...? - Sarah? - What's wrong, honey? Why did you take your necklace off? - I thought it meant a lot to you. - It was choking me. What? Honey, you mean more to me than a stupid necklace. What do you mean, it was choking you? Sarah, are you asleep right now? Are you talking in your sleep? We had a baby. I can feel it kicking. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. What the fuck, Sarah? God, you piece of shit! My finger! What is happening to you? My finger! Open the door! I, uh... Open the fucking door! I got the finger, Sarah. Doctors will be able to fix this for sure, no problem. Simon, open the door! I, uh, can't do it. You coward! You coward, you! - My fucking finger! - Sarah, please stop. My finger. My finger! My fucking finger! My fucking finger! My fucking finger! I'm glad I didn't have a baby with you. What? Sarah, are you OK? What's going on? - Is that real blood? - Sarah? Simon? Simon? Are you OK? What's going on, man? Simon, open the fucking door. Simon, open up. No! 'I looked for the light, but I couldn't find it.' 'She gave me the evil eye. The bitch at the restaurant. 'Simon doesn't believe in anything.' Fuck off! Fuck you! Fuck you! You're in the dark now. She gave me the evil eye. The old bitch from the restaurant? There's a lot of envious people. I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. Sarah, you're gonna be just fine. Find me. 'Simon... 'Simon... Simon...' 'Simon...' Melissa? What's going on? Where's Dustin? Simon! Simon! You're here! Don't be scared. Come here. Come here! We're pregnant. We're pregnant. You wanna hold it? You wanna hold it, Simon? Simon. Simon. You didn't protect me. Why can't you just be happy? The baby's out. - Simon! - Sarah? Simon, are you OK? What's going on, man? Simon, dude, open the fucking door, man. Open up! Sarah! - Back off! - Simon, open the door! 'Breaking news: police made a grim discovery earlier today 'In a home in Temecula. 'A 30-year-old woman was found severely mutilated 'and another man was found dead. 'According to police reports, '32-year-old Simon Fleming and his partner Sarah Johnson 'were visiting friends Melissa and Dustin Green. 'Simon appeared to die of a heart attack 'while Melissa is being treated for lacerations to the abdomen. 'If these details aren't gruesome enough, 'a severed index finger was found near Simon's dead body. 'According to investigators, the victim locked himself in the bathroom. 'His partner, Sarah, is missing, 'and preliminary investigations suggest the severed finger may belong to her. 'According to investigators, 'the damages on the bathroom door are indications of domestic violence. 'Further evidence suggests that Sarah is pregnant. 'The only person that can provide solid information is Dustin Green, 'but his mental stability is being questioned by the police. 'He is claiming the events were caused 'by his Ouija board and his wife's special candles.' 'How is the baby? 'It smells exquisite. 'You served me very well. 'But your moons are ending. 'And hers shall begin. 'I will make your last breath be her first. 'And for you... 'For you, death is the end. 'No more!' Aw. Are you OK? Yeah. Am I special? Am I special? I was just... thinking I wanted to try something. - OK. - OK? Yeah. Try anything you want. Oh, boy. That's good. Aargh. Wait. Wait... Rachel, help me! Oh, my God. Masha, are you OK? It is not what it sounds like, OK? - She had... - You need to get out of here. She had her hand on my neck. I couldn't fucking breathe! You need to get the fuck out of here or I'm gonna call the police. Who was that guy, Masha? I don't know. You have to be more careful. Do you want me to call the police? Maybe I need a boyfriend like you. Here, let's get you cleaned up, OK? Are you sure it's not broken? Yeah. I would feel it if it was. - Cos it's crooked as shit. - What? Can you imagine? I would look like an old witch. That's not the worst thing in the world. Witches are just badass women. They also worship the Devil and eat children. Uh, I mean, if you wanna go with the patriarchal narrative, then, yes. Do you think if Charlie was here, he'd have beat him up? My Charlie? Um... I don't know. Uh, maybe, yeah. I mean, he definitely would have scared him, that's for sure. I scared him already. - What? - Nothing. It's just... You're so lucky to have a boyfriend like Charlie. - I... - Plus, he's really cute. I mean, I buy his clothes, so... But you'll find someone. It just takes time. I just like fucking too much. Oh, uh... Uh-huh. It's in the blood. My grandmother used to fuck everyone back in Romania. That's, like, just too much. I don't need to know. I'm sorry. What I meant to say was my grandmother taught me not to be afraid of my sexuality, even though she suffered a great deal from what people thought about her. But now she's so old, she doesn't care what people think. She's 93, but if you saw her, you'd say she's 60. Wow. Uh, what's her secret? Babies' blood. That's makes total sense. Babies' blood. I am starving. Do you want me to order some food for us? Definitely. Hey, Rachel. Thanks for being so nice to me. Not everyone is. Yeah. How's grad school, honey? Well, knowing you, you'll probably be valedictorian. No, there are no valedictorians in grad school, Mom. - How's Charlie? - 'Yeah, he's been...' He's been great. Charlie's been really supportive. Well, he's always been so great. And what's up with Mara? Uh... No, her name is Masha, not Mara. - Oh, OK. What's she like? - 'Um...' I mean, she's kind of lost, but... And, um, she's a little weird, I would say. But I think she has a good heart. OK. Hey, what's going on? You sound a little... No, don't worry about it. Yeah, I'm excited to see you guys at Christmas. Uh... You know what? Mom, the power just went out. - Let me call you right back, OK? - 'OK.' Masha? Masha? Oh, my God, Masha. The power is out in the whole block. God is angry. - Are you really religious? - He's afraid. How do you know it's a he? Thanks for putting up with me, Rachel. What do you mean? I know you think I'm weird and lost. Uh, if you're talking about that scumbag, don't worry, I'm the last person to judge, believe me. - Really? - Of course. Yeah. I've had my fair share of... abusive, sociopathic men in my life. I almost got married to one. What happened? It's a long story. Power might be out for a while and... I so enjoy stories. He was this narcissistic painter, who fooled me into thinking that we were a team. We used to work together at the art gallery. We connected because we were... frustrated artists and... and his passion was infectious. But after we got engaged, he just... changed. How so? He started doing crazy, controlling things. Like what? He started following me places. He started... going through my phone. Um, he would just... ...literally start interrogating me. And then he would create scenarios in his mind, convincing himself that I had this double life, which was completely false. And then, he would be the one who would disappear for days on end. He literally made me feel like I was going crazy. Do you often feel like you're going crazy? Me? No. Not at all. That's a weird thing to say. It's just... once you go down the rabbit hole, sometimes it's hard to come back up for air. How did you do it? I fucking changed the locks without telling him, and threw that engagement ring in the dumpsters behind our place. And the creepiest thing was that... ...the next morning it was back on my night stand. He had followed me, broke into the place while I was sleeping and put it there. Yeah, that's when I got a restraining order and that was the end, that's how I did it. I'm sorry you went through so much pain. You've always been so nice to me. I would never want you against me. Why would I be? Some people hate me. You had a taste of it tonight. If you're talking about that creep, that was not your fault. That had nothing to do with you, Masha. People should be good to me, that's all. My grandmother's dying. The one you were just telling me about? I'm sorry. She can't get out of bed, she's so sick. She told me, at night her bed is filled with cockroaches. Oh, my God. But when she dies, I'll gain all her powers. What do you mean? She's a witch, Rachel. And when she's dead, I will be, too. I don't understand. You've always been so good to me. There's no reason to be afraid. 'Go down that rabbit hole.' 'Charlie's very cute.' You've always been so good to me. You have no reason to be afraid. Hello. You can come in. Hi, I'm looking for Rachel. She actually just went on her lunch break. Can I help you? - I'm Masha, her roommate. - Oh. OK. I didn't know she had a roommate. I'm new. That's great. Rachel is awesome. Mm. She looks like she has a really cool job. Yeah. She should back in 45 minutes. Can I take a message”? No, that's OK. Can I help you with anything else? I just wanted to talk to her about last night. I think I scared her, because I told her about this narcissistic, abusive boyfriend I used to date. Oh, uh, I'm... I'm really sorry. I mean, knowing Rachel, she probably was very concerned. She's a really caring person. I know. It's just... I think I really freaked her out. You know, because I told her that I still loved him, even though he was abusive and... and I almost married him and he gave me this really fantastic engagement ring. Do you have any gum? Oh, hey, Masha. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Of course. What is it? Why are you going around telling people my story about my ex and the engagement ring? I don't know what you're talking about, Rachel. You told people that that happened to you. You used my story. It did happen to me. It's my story. No, Masha, that did not happen to you. We were sitting right there and I told you that story. That is my story about my ex and my engagement ring. I think you're mistaken. You seem really unstable, Rachel. - Are you feeling OK? - Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't... Uh-uh. You don't get to do that. That's fucking insane. You know what? I'm going home for Christmas and... when I get back, I want you out of here. We shouldn't have come here. Well, we need to get our life back on track, so... why don't you have a beer? Will you hide that, please? Nobody saw anything. Lighten up. Hey, guys. Hey, how are you? You guys having a good time? Yeah. Jesus, Dustin, you look like shit, man. Ah, thank you. Uh... Thanks for inviting us. I'm gonna go take a piss. What's his problem? Relationship issues, so... It's occupied. Yeah, I figured. Can you hurry up? You got people waiting out here. Someone's in here. Hey! Bitch, what? You can stop washing your filthy cunt. You're not getting fucked tonight. Excuse me? Oh, you heard me. Now, open the fucking door or... Or what? Yeah, that's what I thought. Ow! What the fuck? Aargh... - What did you just say? - Nothing. But have you fucked her? Not yet. What did you just say, huh? - What did you just say? - Let me go. - Where the fuck did you learn that? - Let me go. - Who taught you that? - You're hurting me. I don't give a fuck! Where did you learn that? - You're hurting me. - Who told you that? - Help! - Don't call for help. Look at me. - Who told you that? - Help me! Who told you that? OK, on the count of three, tell me what her sign is. One, two, three, Leo. - Sagittarius. - Oh! - You fucked up again. - Damn. I'm... I'm off my game. You know, I thought you... - Help! Help! - Don't! Shut the fuck up! Ah, God... Look, get out of my head, huh? What the fuck are you? What the fuck are you? Hey, hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, stop it. Paul, get off of me. Get off of me. What is wrong with you? You don't understand, Paul. - What's wrong with you? - You don't know what she was saying. There was this girl... What were you saying? How did you know that? How did you know that? Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out! - I'm sorry... - Get the fuck out! She was saying it, Mel. She was saying what we heard that night. Calm down. You don't know what we heard that night. I heard her say that fucking mantra that Sarah kept repeating. - Just be quiet, OK? Be quiet. - Look, I heard it word for word. And I didn't just hear it, Melissa. I felt it. She's in there. That girl is in there and she's gonna try and hurt somebody. Fuck. - Do you believe me? - Of course. - Then, what are we gonna do about it? - I don't know. But first we're gonna get the fuck out of here, OK? We need to go home and... I need to research, and we're gonna rid ourselves of this shitty energy. OK? And I'll find out who she is. And when I find out who she is, then I'm gonna... Oh... Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Mel... Mel... Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. What's going on? Um... Melissa... got hit by a car last night. Oh, no. Is she OK? No, she's, um... She's dead. That's so sad. - Did you know her? - Yes. Yes, I knew her. I'm really sorry. Are you OK? I'm just gonna finish packing. - I wanted to apologize. - Yeah. Yeah... Will you forgive me? I know I'm weird. I didn't mean to hurt you the other day. I'm sure you didn't mean to do anything, Masha. So, you forgive me? Yes, I forgive you. I have to go. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. 'Hi. I'm unavailable right now. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.' Hi, honey. I'm trying to track you down. I don't know if you're in the mood for red or white tonight. I don't know where you're at. I've been calling. I'm coming. Uh, yes? - Hi. You must be Mary. - Yes. How can I help you? Oh, I'm Masha, Rachel's roommate. Oh, Masha. I've heard a lot about you. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. - Oh, thank you. Um, is everything OK? I've been trying to reach Rachel. Oh, I must have arrived before her, which is weird because I definitely left after her. Maybe she's picking up Charlie on the way. Oh, I... I'm not sure I understand. I'm so embarrassed. Rachel invited me over tonight, because I don't have anywhere to go and... she didn't want me to spend Christmas alone. Oh. Uh, well... please, come in. Thank you. Make yourself comfortable. I have been trying to reach her for the last 20 minutes. She's probably with Charlie. Maybe they're busy. What do you mean? Fucking. Maybe that's what's taking them so long. I'll be right back. 'I'm unavailable right now. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.' It smells exquisite. What are you cooking? - Honey-glazed ham. - Mm... My favorite. So, are you gonna open the present? You know, Masha... I don't want to be rude. I said open it. Where's my daughter? Open it. It's a girl. Isn't she pretty? I call her Rachel. I'm gonna ask you again. Where is my daughter? You don't recognize her? How can a parent not recognize their own child? Get out or I'm gonna call the cops. She is begging for your help. It's not very nice. Get out! Out! You really don't believe me, do you? Oh, my God. You're gonna be really sorry. Because your dead daughter is under that table. Go on. Look. Get away. I'm calling the police! I am calling the police. Get away! You killed my daughter. You're in the dark now. 'Charlie!' I've been so jealous of Rachel and how you made her feel so special. You know, all my life... I've always felt so weak and vulnerable. And like no one saw me. But I realized that I can choose to be strong and powerful. And I don't need anyone to love me. I never thought I could get a boyfriend like you. But I was wrong. It's OK... ...cos you're my boyfriend now. And I'm gonna fuck you like you've never been fucked before. Just when things were getting interesting. Don't move. T-t-take me to the hospital, please. Take me to the hospital! Hospitals are for ordinary people. We are not ordinary people. I-I don't wanna die. 'Sweet child. 'You will live. 'Girls. 'My beautifuls. 'Bow to the new queen.' 'Breaking news. 'Sarah Johnson was found tonight by the Temecula Police Department. 'What I'm about to tell you will make your blood curdle.' 'Sarah?' Sarah? Hey. I'm Jessica. - I'm here to... - I know who you are. You're here to tell me that I'm crazy. Sarah, I need you to tell me what happened that night. Look at my finger! Look at my finger! Look at my finger! Sarah, who did that to your hand? Was it Simon? You can tell me if it was Simon. Look at my finger. What happened that night? Sarah, what happened to your baby? Sh-she... ate it. Oh! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? I'm sorry. Sorry for what?
