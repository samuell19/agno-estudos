Hey. Did anything fall on you? Shouldn't we call our parents? Just to let them know we're okay. We were only shaking a minute. Where is everyone else? Did they leave? Hey, what was your name again? Olivia. Some call me Dolly. Everybody calls me that, and I hat... I hate that. You bring your doll to school? It's an antique. It's not like it's a toy or anything. - Dolly... - No, don't. Don't tell the other girls, okay? Wasn't so long ago we were all playing with dolls. Oh, shit. Hey, come on, clean up. No way. Up to you. I don't wanna get my dress wet. Take your dress off. I don't even know you. What do you think you have that I haven't seen? I'm not getting naked. What, are you on your period or something? Probably. Okay, well, sorry. I mean, it's not like I'm afraid of water or anything. I mean, I shower every night. I'm pretty sure that's what my aunt taught me. My step-dad taught me. He teaches me everything, he taught me how to dive. And if he's okay, I bet he's gonna come after us, 'cause he's basically a fireman. I saw a house on fire once. In Malibu. The whole mountain was burning. And there was a house on top of that mountain and... It was burning too. I watched it burn down to nothing. I'm-I'm sure there was nobody inside. I'm sure your stepdad will come. Hmm. I mean, everyone knows we're here. - Of course they do, they dropped us off. - Right, of course. Do you hear sirens though? Like in the distance? I don't hear anything but you. Right, but... I mean, shouldn't we hear sirens? We should at least hear something. I mean, my aunt lives in the valley and she hears sirens all night, and helicopters at four in the morning. You know, it's good that we don't hear anything. Maybe. Like... nothing too terrible has happened. But what if he isn't okay? Your stepfather, I mean we were shaking for a while... - He's fine. - And what if our parents aren't coming to rescue us because they need someone to rescue them. I mean, I don't wanna be dramatic, but it looks like we're trapped. Can we even find a way out? We're still shaking a little bit, aren't we? We'll find a way out, yeah. What if... What about the roads? I mean, what if... what if we don't hear the sirens because all the policemen are dead. I mean, is that possible? That everyone out there is in so much trouble, but we-we're in the worst trouble because we're in here... alone. I don't even know you. Look. It's the reflection from the chandelier. Whoa! It's wrecked in here. We know that. How do you guys feel? Not hurt. Oh, no, I don't mean physically. This is stressful. Do either of you smoke? No, it's disgusting. You? You were gonna let me suffocate in here, I know it. Where'd you get that? The chandelier. Why are you all just hanging around? Eden... What do you think? Do you know where your mom is? Do you know when she's gonna be back? We know about the front door, we know about the cellar door. Are there any other doors? That's a stupid question. Of course, there's another way out, and we're finding it, so everyone up. - Right? - No. The house isn't exactly stable, right because we're literally underground. We don't have running water. We shouldn't split up. I don't see anything. Okay, well, some of us will go look in the bedroom, and some of us will stay here. What are we looking for? This is all just to keep us from panicking. Happy Birthday, Annie. I used to have a cat like this. Oh, yeah? Cats steal your breathe while you're sleeping. Stop. Stop it. You bitches scared it away. Oh, my God. This is not an exit. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. It's broken. I told her not to. Well, I'm independent. Forget about the bedrooms, or trying to squeeze through any of the windows... We can't get out. - We even saw... - We're gonna be here a lot longer than an hour? We're gonna be here for a while. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You can't talk without the crystal. Okay? 'Cause otherwise then everybody talks once - and then nobody listens. - This is just like school. This is just as oppressive as school. Here. Take it. Take charge. I'll do it. No. No one wants to. Default. - Democracy. - Like that even works. I honestly don't trust any of you. We can vote. We don't need a leader, we can all be equal. I-I nominate Olivia. I nominate me. Okay. Who votes for Piper? Now, who votes for Olivia? We're her friend. Right? Just for a couple of hours. Countdown. Looks like we're pretty solid though the weekend. - Na-uh. - I'm not wasting the whole weekend here. Just don't touch anything or don't do anything. Don't use anything until you have to. Or we can just... manifest a rescue. Turn the phones off. - Why? - To save battery. Who cares? They don't work. Yes, they do. It's just that we don't have any bars. Mine's no different. We turn the phones on for a second and see if anyone has called, or texted, or check the bars. But then we have to turn them off. But turning them on an off wastes the power. Just don't let the phones die. Do you know anything about electricity? I know the lights weren't on. Duh, if the light were... I have the crystal, so it's my turn. And I know the lights aren't on, but I did see the box where you... - You flip the... - You... You... Me, Amanda, and Mallory are the eldest, so we will take care of the phones, and go through all the bedrooms to make sure they're empty. We'll keep everyone safe. I agree with "safe." We're not safe. I saw someone. I saw them. No, you didn't. We were in every room. Were we? Eden, there's no one here but us. They were coming at me when everything's still shaking. - A boy? - A man. They were making these sounds. They were saying something. Not my name, but these sounds. Eden... how do we get outside? He's inside. It's a blackout. We need power. We need to try the breakers like we tried the phones. Promise? - Yeah. - I-I promise. - Sure. - Yeah. Ready? Happy Birthday, Eden. Let's divide the piece up. Evenly. There's crackers. And diet soda. I saw chardonnay. It's an aftershock. Ohh, meteorites! What's that? Hmm... Uh. It's fine, look. It's fine. We're fine. We're fine. - Let her go. - What? I mean, come... What's your problem? Someone go check the phones and the box. Eden already did that. Eden already did that, trust me. Eden? Eden? - Eden? - Look out. Eden? Eden? Eden? Eden? Eden? Eden? Whoa. What is this? Oh... it feels funny. It smells sweet. Eden? Eden? Eden? Eden? Let's just not let any negative energy intervene. Yeah. I mean... This could mean that Eden got outside. Eden's never been outside. Has anyone ever seen Eden outside? No. She knew a secret door or some shit, and she left us here. Maybe. Maybe. You hear that? It attacked me. I thought we only had to worry about the man. But... looks like there's an animal too. There is no man. There is a man. Eden saw him, and... he knows there are girls here. Some of us still have a "V" to lose. Oh, don't say shit like that! Do you want them to think that a man's gonna come in here? Dolly can barely hold a pair of scissors. That's not my problem. All of our problem. Do you really think Eden saw someone? A man? Yes, Piper, a man. We can't ask her because she's gone, isn't she? So Olivia... thinks I'm scaring you... by talking about the man. But we're not little girls. We're women. So ugly. I mean, I know you're not supposed to say that about art, but... But it's really ugly. Yeah, but... Don't you think you need a little ugliness? Some beauty's empty, it's like oppressive. People think that everything needs to be beautiful, but beauty is our baggage. Like pink, how pink is pretty but not when it's in my hair. I never really liked pink. My favorite color's green. Then you should dye your hair green. Yeah, well... my other favorite color's grey. No one's favorite color is grey. Grey's the ugliest color that there is. Unless if you see beauty in the ugly. I never really thought about it. They've never tell you about what this is? No. It's from German mythology. Frauenwelt means "the lady world." A beautiful woman from the front and her back is covered in puss and maggots. Personally I don't appreciate the metaphor. What time did you get in? Late. You were kicking all night. I had a bad dream. About what? I don't remember. But I'm thirsty. I'm really, really thirsty. Morning. Wake. Morning and wake. Two words to describe the beginning of the day... and the end of our lives. What'd you dream about? Nothing. I squeezed my eyes and tried to dream about Eden. What are we supposed to do? I don't know. What are we supposed to do? This is pretty boring, huh? Boring's fine. Boring is the worst. The worst. I wonder if the man can hear us. I'm not playing that game. What game? Whatever it is you're doing. I'm just saying. Right. This party would be a lot more fun if boys were here. This party would be a lot more fun if it were over. You don't like me. It's cool, you don't have to. You know my mom says that girls never really like each other because we're too competitive. Who? You and your mom? Maybe. My stepfather... always says that pretty girls just want to be told that they're smart, and smart girls just want to be told that they're pretty. And that's why we're never happy. That's why we never like each other because we just want boys approval. Well, I hope he's not a guidance counselor. He's a volunteer fireman. Well... I think it's fine to be mean if you're smart, and obviously I think it's fine to mean if you're pretty. You could just be nice. You could be anything to anyone. Brr-ing, brr-ing. Brr-ing, brr-ing. Hey. I'm just calling to let you know I'm not coming in to work today. It isn't because I'm being irresponsible. It isn't because I'm sick... and it isn't because I couldn't get a ride. It's because something horrible has happened. Which you probably already know because you're dead. Do you think it's war? Anyway, sorry. Thank you. Bye. Boop. Piper wants you to stay in the living room. I'm allowed to go anywhere. What are you talking about? Is it the man? You think you could escape him? He... He doesn't want me. I'm just a little girl. You said it. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help! Help! Help! Here we are. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please! Help! Please! Help! Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. They'll come back around. Where is everyone? You all stink. And whoever... peed in the toilet... is a stinky pig. Dead. Dead. It's dead. It's dead. - Dead. - Stinky pig. Dead. Dead. - It's dead. - Dead. - Dead. - Stinky pig. - Dead. - Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead! I don't mean to upset anyone but we're stranded. And I don't mean to blame anyone but you let the phones die. The electricity hasn't come back. We're hungry and we're thirsty, the phones suck, the toilets suck, we ate birthday cake for breakfast. Party's over. The party? We had only a few jobs. Check the boxes, check the phones, stay close. Like how Eden stayed close. Why would you say that? That's offensive. Eden could be lost out there. Or she could be hurt or even... Eden could have been killed. Oh, so now you believe in the man? Yes, I believe in the man. I believe in everything you're saying. And so if you say that there's something worse than us shaking, or our parents being so hurt where that they can't come rescue us, okay. Then I believe you, and if you say that there's a man here who wants to have sex with us, - then I believe you, okay? - We're trapped! So if a helicopter comes by, you can't just be playing okay! We're women, and we need you act like it! Why is that funny? Why is this funny? Why is that funny! Why is this funny! Why is this... You know what you're being? - A mean... - Pathetic. I was gonna say pathetic. You're being a little brat. I'm sorry. Brat... Pathetic... I said I'm sorry. You're being a brat, being pathetic. I said I'm being sorry! I said... I said I'm sorry. They chose me, Piper. Can you deal with it? Maybe another helicopter will come. We could make a signal. We could all scream at the same time. - It's never coming back. - Every 15 minutes. - It's never coming back. - Shh! Hear that? That's our stomachs growling. Meeting. Dining room. Now. - I am sick of the crystal. It's done. - No. It isn't. - Then let's vote. - No. No, we're not voting. Put your hands down. We need the crystal and we need the meetings and we need the rules or else we're not going to survive. How long do you think you can go without water? We're dirty. We're so dirty. - Everything is so dirty. - We're in trouble. We were in trouble anyways. The man stalking us. New rule. No one mentions the man. There is no man. - You don't make the rules. - I do. We're all scared of him. We should only be scared of each other. We aren't the ones who killed Eden. No one killed Eden. She probably just wandered off. And if she wandered off, where did she go? If she got out of the house, this should be over. Eden said he was moaning... with pleasure. He's perverted. And he wants us because we are young and we're helpless and he can keep thinking that all he wants. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please... She's brainwashing them. No, she's hypnotizing them. Friendship is propaganda. Complete cold, total trance. But, dude, Dolly... Dolly would swallow a turd for you. I don't want Dolly to swallow a turd. I know. - You don't wanna see Dolly swallow a turd. - I know. That's why you're our hero. Don't say a hero. You kind of want there to be a man. Anybody who's older than us. If my stepdad were here he would ground every one of us. Okay. Well, the world beat him to it. Get it? I know Eden made it and is looking for help. - Yeah. - She's actually really athletic, you know? She's also a really good swimmer. She can hold her breath, do a hand stand underwater for, like, five minutes. - That's crazy. - Yeah. I bought her a bathing suit for her birthday. Hmm. The presents. I don't know, not tonight. Yeah, another night. I just... Hold on. Oh. Kill me. I just wanted to say. I'm sorry. Because I'm never gonna see you again. I thought that we were gonna make up. We were supposed to make up but then we didn't. And... You know, time passes and now it's like we never knew each other. It's like... we were... never even close but we were, I remember. I... And I did terrible things to you. I did every terrible thing I could think of to do. And at the time I wanted to do worse. I wanted to spit in your face. I had this... I had this really clear image of me spitting in your face. And I regret that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I saw him! I saw him! What did you see? I saw him. I saw the man. Where was he? He was under the tarp. Blake and I were in the cellar and we didn't see anything. So where in the cellar was he? I don't know. I saw him under the tarp. Fine, then let's go down there and if he is there then we'll see him. We want him to come to us. Why would we want that? Because in the cellar we're in his territory. But in here, we're pretty kitties. Knives, scissors, things to bash him with. He's a pervert who wants a peep show. So, we'll give him one. And then we squeeze, squeeze. We're gonna get him. We're gonna get him. Did you hear that, Olivia? We're gonna get you. Meow. Eden's dress. Eden's dress... He's... He's killed her. He's killed her. He's killed her. He's killed her! He's killed her! He's killed her! - He's killed her. He's killed her. - I don't want this. - I said everyone gets one. - What? Sword. Be bold ladies. Be fearless. - Cut him like you cut meat. - I remember meat. Who thinks we shouldn't listen to Olivia. Hands up. Fine. Bedrooms are for ladies only. Living room is for chicken shit girls if you aren't in the bedroom now! Who can sleep? If you're closing your eyes and you're lying down then you're sleeping. Shit. What? He didn't mean to split us up. Que sera, sera. What's that? It means we were always split up. We're always fucked. Keep your focus. Sense him. I already do. I know what he's thinking. I know what he wants. What does he want? I'm the man. Where are your knives? Where are your knives? Stand. Stand up. Okay, Piper. God. Now stop. Amanda is the man. Who wants to push me. I will kill you. I'm gonna kill you. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. Bury us. He's come. I'm listening. She's dying. Listen to me, she's dying! I understand, now can you listen to me? Piper! Oh. What did you do? What did they do? We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you. We hate you! We hate you! We hate you! Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. - She's okay. - Please. She's okay. She's just... She's just locked in there. Dolly... My name is not Dolly. Please. Read my mind, can you? Please, help! You're still in charge. You are over me. Dolly. Please, help. She-She shouldn't have gone in there. She shouldn't have gone in the bedroom. We don't have to. She shouldn't have gone in and we don't have to. I mean we can just stay out here. We have everything we need out here. I think it's their misfortune actually because we've got the kitchen. We didn't do anything wrong. We haven't done anything wrong this entire time. We didn't stop them. Piper will let her out. She'll feel guilty and then she'll have to... We're not boys. We aren't brutal. Help! We'll look back on this as... dumb. When we're home... In our room... We'll look back on this as just the dumbest thing. Please, help! Please! Let me out. I can't hold any longer. Don't say her name again. Ladies, gather. We have to defend the bedroom. So that no one sneaks in. They wouldn't dare come in here. Oh, of course they would. They want what we have. Each other. First, offence... before defense. Go check. We're going crazy. SIT STILL. I don't know why they took it. I don't know why they would... I don't know what they would need it for but they took it. Need what for? They took it. The doll? I don't know... I don't understand why they would take it. They took everything. There's nothing left. You can stop looking. It has been mine... It has been mine from when I was born. I don't... I don't know anyone. Cause you own it? I do. Let's get cleaned up. Look like we used to. There's towels in the linen closet. Let's just get cleaned up a little bit - and talk to them. - No. No. They're gonna laugh. They'll... They're gonna laugh. Not if we act like adults. They would never act like this if their parents were here. Maybe we should just wait for the parents to come. There's no waiting anymore. Don't make me look at them. I'm not making you do anything. You want the doll back. I do. I do. I do. I do but I don't wanna fight more. We're not gonna fight. Adults. Remember. There's towels in the linen closet. Let's just get cleaned. You first. We're friends. Even though, you are stuck with me. Even though, you would rather have any of them in here with you. We're friends. We're friends. Piper said they'd come. We don't want you. Keep your calm. We came to speak to Piper. I'm Piper. Talk to me. We came for a meeting. You can call it if you want to. Meeting. Where is my doll? She's up my ass. You go away. You stay in the dining room. Give me the doll. Why? Cause I asked you to. Where is it? Is it under here? How did you get clean? You can't take the spit from our mouths. Oh, you think you're clean? You're not clean. And you think we're dirty but we're not dirty. We're ladies. You smell like bad breath. Like puke. Like pus. Like rot. Like pus. Like rot. We want the doll. - Pus. - And I want the key to that closet. Give it to me. I am the only one looking out for anyone else in this house. Like flipping a switch on and off. Cause you're just sitting here, sucking your thumb, waiting for your daddy, the fireman, to come save us. Come pull the kitties out of the tree? Well, I don't need saving. Sure. Save yourself. Save me. I'm not afraid to ask you for help. We're not supposed to be against each other. It was cruel of you to come in there and steal everything like you did. What's the point in being cruel? I would have given you everything. Have it. Here. Ask and I'll give. Take it. Take it. You can stay in this house forever. I don't give a shit. We want the doll. And we want the key. And then we'll go. Save yourself. No. They do what I tell them. Hey, Hey. Dolly, you want a dolly? Okay then. Please, please, please, please! Dolly is the the dolly. Oh, please... Oh, please, give it to me. Please. Please. No! Please, stop it. No. Please, no. Please, stop. Dolly! Olivia! Olivia! Open the door. Olivia! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You are a bad leader, Olivia. And we were never friends. You will only let people think we were friends because you are obsessed with being liked. I don't know why anyone cares about being liked when everyone else is so awful. But, also, I told you that we didn't need a leader. No one needs to be in charge when everyone has a knife. A knife to stop the man who can't just stop himself. I'm gonna find a way out. Come with me. You and me. Come on. I... I just wanted us to get rescued. What are they gonna do? Piper. - Piper! - No! No!
