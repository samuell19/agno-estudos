The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP, the Mounties, a symbol to all a world of justice and principle, courage and courtesy. Mounties in plainclothes enforce the federal drug and narcotic laws. The dope peddler casually lights a cigarette and throws the empty box away. The new recreational cannabis regime will officially come into force on October 17th of this year. Every dog has its day and Cona has had hers, at least with the RCMP. The three year old German Shepherd trained to sniff for drugs including marijuana is being replaced. Well the new marijuana laws definitely have changed the rules for us. I'm your drug dealer Luke. It's never gonna happen. 4640 Paradise, this is code four. My usual order there Bunk? No, I got plenty. I'm actually here as a friend, well and future husband. They gave us specific orders to shut down anything that's not government run. I guess you'll be buying elsewhere. I can't be seen buying pot. I don't have a prescription. How're you okay with this? You're a traitor to the cause. And you wonder why I'm not interested. Ours is a love of the ages like Romeo and Juliet. What am I supposed to do this? Break it up. Not too fine, she's got arthritis. I'm discreet. And we're not stupid, you're known Anne. I mean I'm not gonna bust your door down but some cop wanting to increase their quota might. Right. Everybody wants to smoke but nobody wants it in their backyard. Whoa, what's this? You're growing now? Come on, relax. It's just a couple of plants. This is Maryline. Say hi. Ma'am. It's fucking ridiculous. I mean, I fought for legalization. I should be celebrating on Monday not looking over my fucking shoulder. Anne, I need you out or I need the rent. Are you kidding me? You're broke drug dealer? I deal weed Luke not heroin. It's the McDonalds of drugs. You know, I heard that Winnipeg is nice this time of the year. Here in Winnipeg is International Airport. Some people call it the Taj Mahal of the Canadian prairies. No matter how you look at it, Winnipeg is growing up. I'm sorry to be a bummer, but it's time to move on. I thought you weren't giving up. You know, I'm glad that we're communicating so openly. It's the foundation of any strong relationship. Ma'am. Where have you been? You're late. You know I like mine before breakfast. Bus troubles. Why don't you Uber? Kidnapper express, no thank you. Oh, my super like said hello. He could be a serial killer. Seriously he doesn't even need to stalk you. He just needs a Tinder profile. Oh, wants to meet this afternoon. He's hungry. You know what serial killers have in common? They're all white and they're all clean looking. Well, I find them to be very polite and eager to please. And they really love gilfs. What's a gilf? Grandma I'd like to... Still so weird. 'Cause I'm old? No, you're just so open about it. Well, we Canadians like to keep our drugs and our fucking behind closed doors. Yeah, got it. Here. No, big day, lots of deliveries. If you wanna Netflix and chill with Ted Bundy that's on you. Bonus, penis pic. Oh god! Fuck me. Oh fuck it, I've had a good life. Here, I'll ask him if he's a serial killer just so you don't have to worry about me. Great. As weed is set to become legal across Canada, lineups are already forming in front of CDCBO stores across the province with demand already threatening to outstrip supply. So the government finally did it. Yep. They managed to take the fun out of legal weed. I was so excited about it. Until our nanny state of the government stepped in. This gonna affect you, how? I'll be okay. I'll keep a low profile. Not take on any new clients but everyone's regulars, so it's fine. Well, my love, I won't be on Monday. Why? Shoppers is carrying it. So? I have a points card and with the amount I smoke I'll been racking them up. You're leaving me for points? Hey, that shit adds up. I've been with you for years. I've helped you manage pain and if it wasn't for me, you'd probably be addicted to painkillers. Business is business. You were an activist. You're like in jail for a while or something. You're seriously gonna buy from some faceless capitalists assholes? Do you have a points program? No. Do you have a loyalty program? What about LSD? LSD? You know I only sell weed. Then you've got a problem. But you're a smart girl. You'll figure something out. Thanks, grandma. Diaper weed? I told you I don't give a fuck about your IT issues. I lost millions because you couldn't make the trade. I want you to make good, or I'm gonna go with someone who doesn't have fucking dial up. No peeking. Don't flatter yourself. Fuck! Ground as per request. Thank you. Someone doing what I asked. You want a job? No. I'm good. What? No line, no peeking. I'm the government mafia man, those fuckers, they take no prisoners. I'm hoping for loyalty from my customers. Fucking brilliant, loyalty. I love it. You'd love my old man. Oh hey, check out this new app. It's like the Tinder of weed. I can choose from like 300 varieties and it's delivered in an hour, just swipe right. Now I'm not gonna stand in line like some stoner schmuck or wait for Canada Post. This motherfucker upped his game. But we found the strain that works for you. Maybe I wanna mix it up a little. Okay then, don't smoke at work. It focuses me. Yeah, because of me. Okay, smoke Godfather OG and you will not know what the fuck you're trading. Afghan Cush is gonna knock you out. Charlotte's Web is made for people with epilepsy and has 0.3% THC. Teen Drizzy, Belieber. These aren't even fucking strains. You don't know what's in them. This is a total gimmick Brent. Look I'm not Domino's, okay? I don't deliver in 30 minutes or less. I'm like a good tailor. I know my shit and I cut to fit. They even have a loyalty points program, fucking A. Loyalty, being the key word here. Since you met me, you have experienced record returns. And actually I should be charging you more money. Because without me you'd still be sitting in that shitty cubicle wearing off the rack suits driving a Civic instead of a Porsche, okay? Look, I don't deliver points, I deliver a seven figure bonus. No I deliver, you just work on a fucking line. Fuck you. Tell her I said hi. Why would you buy in bulk now? A dealer gave me a great deal. I've the best shit in town. CDCBO to closes at five, they don't have enough to supply. I figured demand is going to increase with legalization. What about the club? People wanna go up, not down. Now if you dealt in coke. Coke? Coke, heroin, pills that shit just fucks you up. At least with weed it helps people, kind of feel like one of those country doctors, making house calls and checking in on people, offering advice, a little relief. Well, it's the things that fuck you up that make you rich so, unless you find some new patients the only gig left doing house calls is Uber Eats. Luke says I'm on the radar. And I can't trust new clients unless I get references but I don't have time. You hit that yet? Who, Luke? No. Why not? He's nice, but he's so eager. He's constantly saying sorry for everything. It's not hot. Nice, eager, constantly apologizing, sounds like you hit the bedroom jackpot right there. Mind if I call him? You sound like my grandma. We're both women of the world. We've learned shit, like diversify your portfolio. I will talk to Steve at the club. Thank you. I'm sorry, I know he's a douchebag. He is slimy cocksucker. Maple syrup goes with fucking everything. Honey, I'm not Costco. I don't do returns. Oh my God. Have your parents seen that yet? Yeah, of course they have. Now that it's legal and I've met Prime Minister hot stuff. My parents think I'm a visionary. I even smoked up with my mom last week. It was really special. Coffee, weed and vinyl. Yeah, the weekend hipster trifecta. And you even made it ethnic. Like bees to honey. Fuck, you're smart. Well, I'll be moving out soon. But for now, this serves its purpose since I do most of my business online. That's all they see. Green health? Sounds like an Anima. I need to bring a veneer of respectability to my business, especially now that I'm going legit. You're opening a store. No. I'm now a government licensed lab. I'm a micro cultivator. You are? Yeah, I'm the poster child for a new day, and I'm gonna grow like Jeff Bezos. I'm gonna be the Amazon of weed. Well, great, then you can buy my stuff back no problem. I'll even take a hit on the buyback. I know this is a weird request. But I've always been loyal and most of my people left so I just need to get back on my feet. I can't. It's all regulated. I make one misstep, they pull my license. Fuck, really? What if I sell it back to you? 30% below what I paid for it. You're making a profit on a profit. Isn't that like your mantra? My mantra, I'm brown, I'm a woman. I'm gonna get screwed. So always look for the next opportunity. But you sold me all this. And you're the one who had a great plan. Listen, Adeela I need this. If I can't make rent, I'm out on my ass and people aren't buying the way I thought they would. Look, remember when we first started dealing in university, we said that it was to pay our bills and to create our own opportunities. No, we said it was so we could smoke weed for free. True. But once we started making money, we said that it was to avoid having a desk job. Remember? You were gonna go and travel and help save people and animals and shit because you feel guilty about your privilege. And I was gonna make money off of people like you. But I love dealing. I'm good at it. Then find a new opportunity. This is our time. Dealing weed is like the mullet. It's dead and it's not coming back. It was a fun ride while it lasted partner. But now, it's time for some tough love. Sorry I'm late. We are busy at the store. We open on Monday and I'm still filling positions in. Can't believe I got an interview so fast. Indeed. So you are? Anne Banting. The microphone's not necessary. Anne Banting, yes. The software we use put you at the top of our list. Wow! So, have you been working for the government long? Thank you for asking. Yes, I worked with the LCBO part time when I was in high school and then I moved up to full time. In 1927, the Government of Ontario created the LCBO, selling all the liquor you need to let down your guard after a hard day, being accepting of everyone and apologizing for everything. And then I worked with the Beer Store. The Government of Ontario helped create the Beer Store, allowing all of us to live up to the Canadian stereotypes of loving plaid, hockey and knowing some guy named Doug. And then I saw an opportunity to move up with CDCBO. But we know Canada is a country full of diverse people and vices and we're proud to announce the CDCBO, the Cannabis Distribution and Control Board of Ontario. You heard it correctly Ontario, your government is sparking up. Full stop. Such different products. I can hear you fine. I mean, are they? It's all the same poison. I believe Snoop Dogg said it best when he said, it makes me feel the way I need to feel. I think he was just talking about cannabis but... That's one person's opinion truthfully, and he is a multi layered artist. Genius in my mind. All right, so tell me about yourself. Well, I'm very excited about this opportunity. I think it's been a very long time coming. And what makes you a unique candidate? Do you hate Bob Marley? Well, I have a degree in economics, and I've had my own business since university. Oh, that's impressive. Yeah, I've been my own boss since then. And it's been a lot of hard work, keeping my clients happy with all the choice out there. So why do you wanna work with the CDCBO? See sometimes it's appropriate. Well, like you I thought I'd get in on the ground floor of a company that's gonna grow very quickly. I mean 40 stores in Ontario isn't enough to match the demand. Right. So it says here that you are a weed dealer. Cannabis, yeah. That works. That's the time that the microphone works. I think it's a perfect fit really. I'm well versed in every strain, I know the effects of each one. And I persevere to find the right strain for each of my customers. And I think if given the chance, I could do the same for yours. Yeah, stop talking. You are aware that this is a government position, right? Yeah. And you're applying for a position as an admitted criminal. I feel like this is appropriate, admitted criminal. See, I took a class on this. Admitted criminal. Not after this weekend. Touche. I can see why the software gave you a 99% match, that's for sure. Well Anne, if I move your application to the next phase, Ralph's gonna flag it. Ralph? My boss. He's a dog person. Don't get me started. I'll take it off my application. And then you'll look like you're unemployed for 10 years. That's not great. Yeah, but drug free. Oh fuck it. Welcome to CDCBO. You start 8 a.m. Monday and if anyone asks, you've been living in a commune in BC for 10 years, all right? Thank you. Yeah. Takes your breath away, doesn't it? A tie. Yeah, nothing but a G thang. Fuck! I love your new place. It must get a lot of great light. Very funny. Hey, what do you think of that? Hey, my old work tie. I wish it was. Yours? That's good. Finally putting that education to good use. Yeah, I guess so. It couldn't last forever, could it? I really didn't think it would end like this. Well, you didn't choose an easy path. Or maybe you did. It needs more green. You sound like mom. Hey, I'm on your side. Fuck it. I'm not working for the enemy. That's my girl. Let's hear it for the crazy one! Woo! Hey, do you think my hair will stay when we're fucking? Oh, I think so. Ah, you are a lifesaver as always girl. And do you have anything that'll help us out? This should put you both in the right mood. I don't need him to go limp and pass out. I need him to go all night. Yes, bitch. That is what I'm talking about. You always know how to hook a girl up. Not to interrupt, weed doesn't actually make you go limp. Coke does. Okay, whatever. I tried. And a valiant effort, okay. Did you talk to Steve? He's upstairs. What is going on in here? What's with all the backpacks? Is this like a weed dealer convention? It's more like an employment fair. Thanks. Hello. Hello. Oh, sorry, is Steve here? Steve. Steve's downstairs playing the role he's paid to play. Sorry. Everybody wants to come to a club run by mobsters. So we give them one ride at a central casting and they go home with a fun story. Guess who's coming back with friends next week? You're best friend Anne, right? Yeah. Yeah. Steve mentioned you'd be coming by. I like Beth. Gotta love Steve's optimism. He also mentioned you're looking for a new line of work. Yeah, I'm looking to expand my reach and navigate the new terrain. Governments always make the best gangsters. If I was bilingual, I'd be prime minister. One would think you'd find a more discreet way than a backpack to carry around your drugs. This isn't Degrassi. Did Steve mention my situation? My product? Have you ever dealt anything else? No, weed is a good fit for my skill set. You're a purist. Exactly. We just developed a new app for weed. It's like Tinder. I'm so excited about it. We even have a loyalty program. Even with legalization the government's not gonna be able to keep up with demand and they close at five. Times are changing. So why did you stick to dealing? You could have worked your way up. You're paid a lot more money distributing. I don't know, I guess I was good where I was. You know I like that you know your place. We can't all be CEOs. I'll give you a trial run as a favor to Beth. Why me? I mean I'm sure you have tons of candidates. Yeah, but they're all children. This is just a game for them. Dealing makes them cool, gets them laid, they still expect everything from life. But you, well, we're old enough to know better. I don't know if I can sell something I don't believe in. Oh, well we all have to believe in something. You're more than welcome to join the legions who still believe that working hard and being polite will get you ahead but, I think you know otherwise. I'm not gonna kill someone. That's not the skill set I'm hiring you for. You can leave your weed on the counter. Canadian Maple is my favorite. Oh my god, Steve. There you are. Fentanyl isn't fucking everything. It's not your fault. It's a risk everyone knows about. Everyone's a fucking adult in there. Yeah, except for me. Jesus. Do you think I like working in this shithole and getting up and going to my day job at nine? No, but I just do it because I need to save to open my own place. My mom cleaned washrooms to put a roof over our head. Dealing isn't hard, Anne. Cleaning toilets is. Yeah but you can't kill anybody while doing it. Well, then you better start scrubbing because you cannot have it both ways. Dealing weed was different. You keep telling yourself that but your friends or your clients or whatever you call them sold you out. Fuck you. No, fuck you. My job, my reputation and my fucking head is on the line because I did you a favor. So stop being so goddamn selfish and self centered. Beth, my whole life has been turned upside down. I'm homeless. Literally. My shit is in a fucking playground. Yeah, and why is that so surprising? I mean fuck, the writing has been on the wall for months. Maybe if you were a little less lazy you would have done something about it, like Adeela. I am not fucking lazy. Sorry, stoned. You can't even follow the first rule of dealing. Don't use your product. Maybe then you would have seen your grand plan for the shit idea it was. Fuck you. I was fucking great at my job. And I tried to do anything to save it. And for the record your boss up there, she has the same plan. I just don't have any money or power. You wanna know another difference between you and everyone else Anne? We know that no one gives a shit about us. So stop being so nice and polite and step the fuck up or get out of the fucking way because some of us are doing what needs doing. I'm short. Well that's disappointing. Look, I'll get you the money. No need. Beth covered for you. She did? Yeah, I see a lot of myself in her. That's why she's my top earner. She's very talented. Talent is merely a point of view applied by others. I look for dirt under the fingernails and give my respect accordingly. You've been around long enough to know that your dealing days are over. Normally I've looked for a little more surety. But I think you knowing that I can get to Beth will be enough. You should go. Freeze! Hands on your head. Going somewhere? No sir. Mind if I check your pockets ma'am? Oh my god Luke, thank god. Whoa, what are you doing here? Do you know who owns this place? Of course you do. What are you doing here? Drug enforcement has been watching this place for the last couple months. Some young kid OD-ed tonight. Is she okay? I called for help as soon as... You what? Fuck Anne. I'm fucking broke Luke. I'm fucking homeless. I'm alone and lost everything, everything. I had no choice. You always have a choice, all right? You don't take what's easiest. Weed is one thing... Maybe I just have to toughen up. You're not the type, trust me. I deal in this shit every day. Fuck you. Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a female dealer? People think they can fuck with you all the time. The constant harassment, nevermind fucking close calls and I've never been arrested and I don't owe anyone shit. How many people can say that? Do you want me to arrest you right now? Is that what you're asking me? You've been dealing hard drugs for what? A day, and someone OD-es and you're talking to a cop for comfort. If you wanna play in that world, you better be ready to pull the trigger if it means getting ahead or surviving. Did they really kick you out? No. I'm working something out. Okay. I know you're trying to find yourself, but I have been the one who's had to tell mom and dad that their kid is not coming home. How did you do it? You came home every day and you looked so defeated. I used to sit there and think, what difference have I made? What have I changed? Who have I affected besides my own state of misery? If I disappear tomorrow, no one would care. I would. Find a way, or fade away. I just had to turn off the CBC. I mean, how much more do we have to hear about their problems? What's the term now? First Nations, Aboriginal, indigenous? You know they don't have running water, right? You would think they own the whole country. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I feel. No, don't hold back. Do you need help letting that cross out front? Don't be crashed here. I'm the least racist person I know. So the marketing company just decided to cut all of its writing staff? Yeah, most of us. They lost a bunch of clients, so they had to do it to survive. So what are you gonna do? I'll find something. I know you will dear. I don't think writing is a long term career for me anyway. Well, why don't you go into banking like your father? You have your economics degree. Mum, I haven't asked you for anything since university. I've paid my own way. It's called being an adult dear. I'm not sure why you and your friends want medals for it. Susan's son Victor, you remember him? A couple of grades above you, red hair, freckles, so cute. I always thought you two make a lovely couple. Anyway, he's still living with his mother. Can you believe it? He's 35, two degrees and he's still in her basement. Nobody's gonna marry him when he's living with his mother. I don't want a job in banking. Why not? Your father was at the bank for 40 years. Yeah, and he hated every minute of it. That's nonsense, dear. There's nothing wrong with a nice secure middle class life. He wasn't the most ambitious of men but... Yeah, but it wasn't his dream, he wanted to be a painter. And he was. It was a nice hobby for him. Just like dealing weed could have been for you. Yeah, but I'm good at it. That's even better. Jack was never very good. Just a lot of colors and stripes. Looks nothing like the Group of Seven. Wait, wait, wait, how did you know? I'm your mother and I'm an intelligent woman. You think I don't know why you always carried around a backpack? Mum, I'm sorry. You should be. I'm so embarrassed. Adeela's mother can't stop bragging. I mean, really Anne? You could have met Justin, but you're just like your father. Wasting every opportunity because you have your head in the clouds. Yeah, maybe if he and I had someone supporting us it would have been different. Don't assume you know what goes on behind closed doors. You'll understand that when you've shared your life and your years with someone. I always supported Jack. He could have climbed the ladder if he'd focused instead of wasting his time painting in the garage. No drive, unlike my father, came to this country with nothing. Worked day and night to make something of himself. He didn't need anybody pushing him. Jack had everything handed to him. And he still said no. You know, I came into this marriage with expectations about our future too. But they didn't seem to count. Can I stay here tonight? I haven't made up the guestroom and Susan's coming over for dinner. Yeah, forget it. I'll figure it out. I always do. Don't be so dramatic. Don't even think about blaming me, I'm not Victor's mother. I'm not gonna put up with that shit for one second. In Toronto, it was treated like New Year's Eve with a bud drop. Even before doors opened, cannabis users lined up to light up. Using debit to buy weed was different. Newfoundland's Ian Power claims he was the first to buy a gram of weed and wants this high to last. I'm gonna frame it and hang it on my wall. Congratulations. You've made today happen. Thanks. I'm a cog in the fucking wheel. She was right. What? It was a nice comfortable life. I started as a clerk at that bank, could have gone higher, just wasn't ambitious. In her mind it was painting that was a distraction, that kept me from being the bank CEO. I saw that bank as a means to an end. You and your mother did not deserve to live in poverty while I scraped by on art grants. I had responsibilities, I took care of them. Just like you are. I think this job has great potential, and it has wonderful benefits. Dad, you were fucking miserable. You said I was. You are a lot like me. You have a healthy sense of expectation. So I'm just supposed to accept my fate like you did. The world of children, is made possible by the world of adults. Oh, come on big motherfucker. Is it always gonna be like this? You know, it reminds me of the LCBO Thanksgiving strike of 1998. I saw a woman, 70 year old woman fighting over a bottle of gin like it was penicillin. It was rough. You can't get those images out of your mind. They are not even asking questions, they're just buying anything with a cool name. They'll settle down once they go out and get baked. Speaking of, can you help me with this? That's... I noted that. Other than customers, how's everything going? Oh, good. Good. What is a that? Flair? Oh no, no, no, the government doesn't do flair. Okay. But you're doing good, okay? Just keep checking those IDs. The customer's always right even when they're wrong and, everyone's an expert, right? So just if they ask, nod and say that you heard Snoop is a fan of that particular strain. Copy. Yeah, copy. Good lingo. Oh, can you? Careful. So is now the time we spend sitting around talking about our feelings until we arrive at some introspective enlightenment about our place in the universe? I'm sorry I took it out on you. It's on me. You picked a weird profession to have a conscience. How did you get out? You're not the only one with friends in blue. I was with Valerie when they came in. She really likes you. So you still thinking about opening your own place? I tried to get a bank loan but the bank said I wasn't a good risk because I freelance so I said fuck it. I'll do it on my own. I'm putting it all away. I'm almost there and then I shall be free. Beth, what about the people that you sell to? People die from that shit. And? I'm dealing at a club where bottle service starts at one K. I'm working class and the people there are only too happy to remind me of that. So fuck them. I'll get mine. How can you think that? How can you live with it? You said it. Money and power. They make the rules. No one gives a shit whether you make an honest living or care about your neighbor. It's gone, Anne. It went out with blue collar jobs and plaid. She's really fucking dangerous. I know. I'll keep on her good side. Thank you, for covering for me. You're gonna get out, right? It'll just take a little longer. You did almost kill someone on your first day. Wait, almost? She survived Florence Nightingale so your conscience can remain clear. You're heartless. And you are working for the man like a chump. $15 an hour. I don't wanna talk about it. Really? Good, 'cause I can only handle one of your problems a day. The entry is 5165. You can stay with me Okay, but only for four weeks and then you're out in your ass. Thank you. Let's fucking dance. Yeah. Oh fuck. Brent. Beth, is that you? Yeah asshole, it's me. Did you tell her I said hi. What is happening? I'm burning. Fuck! My heart... I'm having a heart attack. A heart attack. Let me feel your forehead. He is not burning up. And my brain is on fire. Did you use that weed app? Yeah. The fuck did you swipe right on? Everything. Get a cold towel and some water. Okay Brent, you are having a panic attack. You just need to breathe. Okay? That's it, deep breaths. Deep breaths. What are you doing? Just put it on the towel. He dropped you yesterday. I haven't been out with this asshole for months. Why the fuck are we helping this idiot? Because he called us. His dealer and his ex? You need friends Brent. Put the towel on him. Doesn't even have a label on it. Probably sativa set off his anxieties. He is an indica smoker. Or it's fucking medical grade and some shitbag put oil in it. Okay Brent, did you take anything else? Coke, pills? You limp-dicked bastard. I fuck like a stallion. Oh, I think you're confusing me with that other woman. You know that other woman, the stripper you thought had a heart of gold? She fucking meant nothing, okay? Oh yeah? Nothing, she meant nothing? What about the fucking pictures on your fucking phone? I'm fucking sorry. You're sorry? Focus, focus, focus. We're gonna focus on getting you back, okay? Okay. We're gonna stay here. We're gonna watch you as long as it takes. And if gets any worse we're gonna go to the hospital. No fuck that, fuck the hospital. Yeah, fuck the hospital. Fuck the hospital. He needs to feel the fucking pain. Okay, you fucker. You never cheat on your girl or you're fucking dead. Beth! What? You're waterboarding him! Oh. My bad. Catch your breath. Now try to relax. There you go. Good, good, good, good. What are you doing? What? You don't have any more weed and all I have is coke. I need to relax. No, no, no, do not smoke that. I'm a woman. I can handle my shit. Okay, if you have a bad trip I'm leaving 'cause you guys deserve each other. No don't leave, she'll kill me. Look at you. Yeah, it's kinda nice to have my old life back for a second. Have you guys fucked here? Oh yeah. Oh, fuck yeah. They are two of the country's former top cops. But how times have changed. The two former law enforcement officers have joined forces and formed a cannabis base network. Next, next, next, next. Next. Yes. Hi, I'd like to open a cannabis lab as a micro cultivator. Do you have the relevant paperwork? No, I don't know where to start. So I was hoping that you could help. You'll need to fill out an initial request form. You need to include a business plan including information on where the lab is to be located, preliminary plans. Do you have those forms? We're committed to the environment. Everything can be found on our website. When I just have to print those forms out, and then bring them back anyway. Starting a business is not for the faint of heart. Yeah, I know. I had one until you guys took it from me. We do have some help available. Really? You just need to fill out a 182A-496-697-A, then you can receive counseling on starting a business. Look, I'm a cannabis dealer. Okay, that's my profession. And now that it's legal, shouldn't you guys be helping me with transitioning? I mean, I've heard about all these reprogramming and, retraining opportunities, where are those? Just to be clear, you're asking whether the government can help you transition from the illegal world to the legal one? Hey, you guys took my livelihood from me. Okay, you owe me. I think you have to be on probation to access those programs. Have you ever gone to jail? Are you currently on probation? I'm not on probation, okay? Except for working at the CDCBO. Look, I pay taxes. Now, you guys work for me. Shouldn't the government be encouraging me? Small business is the key to Canada flourishing and women succeeding and make Canada great again. Gary. Gary. Let's make it great together. Oh, it's already great. You better get started. How many dreams do you kill a day? Next. Right now, you may be wondering what benefits you get in exchange for your work in Ontario's civil service? Well, there are many of them. And they're all outlined in your employees' information kit. Oh, I hate people. I keep telling them I'm not high. I'm not gonna work when I'm high. What are you, crazy? Nice flair. Thanks. Are you leaving us so soon? What? No, I love it here. I am so grateful that you took me on Judy. Yeah said with as much conviction as a 15 year old with fake ID. Look I know structure is hard for you but you've got a future here if you want it. I don't know, maybe. I mean I can't even read this. All right let me have a look, scooch. Out you go. I've worked with the government all my life. But this stuff it's insane. Right Jesus, the only thing they don't ask for is an STD test. I wouldn't give them one either. Well this is why the big companies always win. You can't compete, they rig it with all this crap no offense. I wasn't listening 'cause I was thinking, we should partner. Yeah, I could get a grant, a new skills grant for government employees. We're also women. We are also women. Yeah, I'd forgotten about that, rookie mistake. Okay, 'cause there's a fund for women who run small businesses as well. What else could we get? Wow! Food and beverage, women in business, leveraging agents, market fund, arts grant. The arts? Yeah, we could pay some sort of poor artists, preferably from the LGBTQ community. Oh my gosh, it'd be great if they were an immigrant or had some sort of indigenous roots. That would be fantastic. They'll do all our commercials. And forestry? Yeah, we'll just plant a bunch of trees around the weed. And you've never been arrested, right? No. You've spent a night in jail probably. Nada. No, surprising. Too bad, that's a lot of money left on the table. I know a cop, maybe he could help. No, that would flag it. And then by the time you get out, you wouldn't be eligible. Okay. Gary, City Hall guy, he said that I'd have to make an initial payment. He's not wrong. It's $30,000. Holy shit. Yeah. And how long is the application process? Not long, right? I mean what's six months? Half a year, approximately give or take. Will the CDCBO even sell our product? Yeah, probably they would consider it and then, turn it down because they'll deal with larger growers. Yeah, like Shoppers. Yeah. And then we wouldn't get points. Oh, I want my points. Yeah, you're right. Maybe in the future, right? No, because by that time, the price of weed will have gone down because all the big companies will be making it cheaper. Yeah. I mean, that's how they get you, they offer these grants and you can't access them. What about at the CDCBO? I mean, with my expertise, there must be an opportunity. I'm gonna stop you there 'cause there absolutely is not. It's all about seniority like Ralph and his stupid jerk face dog. He's an alcoholic, not the dog, my boss, but he steals stuff from the company all the time. And does he gets shown the door? No, he doesn't. In fact, they're offering him a treatment plan that you and I as taxpayers pay for. It's the worst. I'm fucked. Yeah, well I mean that would actually be good because then you get 12 months paid maternity leave. I mean, that's a joke but not maternity leave, because that's not funny. Motherhood is absolutely something to be taken seriously. I gotta go. Hey doll, wanna hit? No. I'm good. How about a brownie? I got a brownie. The pharmacist said I should try oils but, what the fuck? What am I, a naughty five year old? So smoke. I'm trying but their stuff is shit. Told you. Really? I'm dying and you're gonna say I told you so. Look what I bought. Beautiful, isn't it? Do you wanna talk about it? It's a glass penis. What more is there to say? You know what I mean. Three months, no hope, lots of pain. You wanna know what the doc said? You've had a good run. Wow! Really? I almost kneed him in the balls. That's the whole point of life asshole. Doesn't mean I have to be cool about it 'cause I'm passing third base. Come here. I love you. I'm not gonna lie in some drug induced coma at a home somewhere. No. Fuck God's waiting room. Gonna hit the road with my penis and leave this world the same way I came in, kicking and screaming. Is what I'm gonna do. How can I help you? I'm gonna need your best stuff to control the pain. You helped my son get through it with dignity. I'm sorry. Sorry. Dad you don't have to worry about me, okay? Okay. I wish I was more like you than him. You are. You just have to start using your product. I do. The other stuff, up here. I brought something. It's really strong. Uh, I like the sound of that. This is exciting. You can be my guinea pig. It's really, really strong. Oh, a thing of beauty. Oh, she's mighty. Do not be fooled. We hope. I hate Justin. He used to be hot. Now he not. Do you ever feel like you've disappointed everyone in your life? Oh shit, mixed family guilt? It's too early for this. No, no, it's not that. I don't know maybe it is but, I'm just trying to find my way without saying I'm sorry or kill someone. I feel like those are my only two choices. That's the great Canadian motto. Say sorry or kill someone. Okay, let me break it down for you. I'm about to blow your mind. See this nice little picket fence? This is everyone else. This is you. I prefer marmalade. What are you, like 80? Anyway, look at you. You're different. You're weird. Last week you were a criminal. Well, I technically still am. Great, even better. Do you think these nice gentle pieces of bread are looking at you thinking, wow, that's cool. Look nice red top. She's so different everybody, look at her. No, they're not. They're all wondering why you think you're so special. And why are you ruining the flow of their beautiful nice picket fence. That's what they want. They want you to be just like them, nice and polite. You should run for office. Oh, I'm way ahead of you. I'm already learning how to parlez-vous francais. Adeela, I need your help. And I don't want some bullshit excuses this time. Uh, game on. Yes, I will have another. Thank you. Meenie meenie miney Moe, catch a finger by the toe, if you I'm taking you regardless. Still good. That's the way it goes. Look, Judy I can't work here anymore. It's not me. Well it is me. That's the problem, if I don't get out of here I'm just gonna... Gonna end up becoming me, that's right? No, no, that's not what I meant. You know what? I've hired a lot of people in my day. And you know when the biggest change is? What? No one respects the climb. The climb? The climb, the time it takes to accomplish something, to get somewhere. Everyone just wants free timbits. I've been climbing for 10 years. Fighting to change perceptions, fighting to change laws, all while trying not to get arrested. I helped make this happen. And now they don't want my expertise to help them build what they just took from me. Make a choice. Let the pieces fall where they may but just make a choice. You never wanted to leave when we came here. Just one more slide and that's it, dad. Just one more. That usually got me about six more. I ran out of time, Anne. I did the right thing, I just ran out of runway. I know dad. I know. For folks watching across the country, the original model from the previous government was that there would be provincially run stores. Very quickly in your government's mandate you said, you know what, we're not gonna do that, we're in favor of a private model. We're not in the business of selling cannabis. There you are. Okay, Judy, can I please pick up some shifts? Okay, I just need to start saving and, what? Oh my god. They're shutting down. I'm sorry. Yeah. New government, new ideas. Like right now. Yeah. The government's holding on to distribution and online sales and all the stores are going private. What's gonna happen to you? Oh Ralph being the dog that he is trying to push me out offering me a severance package for my loyal service. He is? Yeah, I'm not taking it though. No, I'm gonna be like a hangover to him that never goes away. How much is the package? Oh, hello. Are we on probation yet? Is the circus in town? What we are is two women who have an interest in forestry, the arts and technology. I believe our whole application is in order. Oh, and what you forgot to do is give an Anne a 4D4603 form, not to worry, I went home and printed it out. I attached it to our deposit. So there shouldn't be any kind of delay in our application. So better catch that before it falls. She owns you. So long sucker. Fuck Mondays. Yes, fuck Mondays. Thank you Adeela for letting us use your lab. My pleasure. I'm happy to help, especially since you cleared my paper trail. You know, you're like the CDCBO oracle. Oh well, I mean you just have to know the system, right? Or be the system. Unfortunately nobody can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. Respect, right? Nerds. Thank you. All right. I'm not gonna finish that. Oh, you know what, I'll have that with you. And I will see you tomorrow, partner. We're ready for this pitch. Yeah we are. Hey, do you like cats? No. That sound, does that make your heart skip a beat? Wow, slow down officer. This shit is strong. It is. Get this off me. Come on, there you go. Oh. It's like you've done that before. You're glowing. So are you. So, I stopped by the evidence locker and I got you something. She is beautiful. Her name is Lauren. Thank you. You're welcome. I thought that flowers would be too eager. Really? That stuff is fantastic. What do you call it? It's my new strain. It's called find a way or fade away. My girlfriend, the cannabis grower. Medical cannabis, by prescription only. The pharmaceutical industry, now you really are a gangster. A gangster, that is not your girlfriend, okay? You take too much credit. Let the games begin. The hours are long, and the work often dull. But the life has many rewards. You're respected as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Well, there you have it. A quick look at the Ontario government and you, obviously in so short a time, we couldn't cover all there is to know about the working relationship between you and the government. There are still many other things to consider. Your employee information kit, your immediate supervisor, and personnel staff will provide you with any additional information that you desire and we hope that this film has helped you better understand your role in Ontario's civil service. Been to a Snoop Dogg concert too. Yeah, it's one of the best nights of my life. I had chosen an outfit that was obviously an attention grabber because on the way in a lot of people were like, hey, do you shop at the Gap, which makes me think, spiffy. And my aunt ironically, was wearing the same thing, khakis blue shirt. It was just something that we, I mean, it wasn't even by choice, just by chance. And we sat next to these two gentlemen that were cool. They were cool. They were like NWA, like that's them. And, I always travel with chocolate. So that's something that is just in my nature to offer chocolate to these guys. And they're like, no, man. I'm cool. And I was like, you are cool because that's more Smarties for me. That's very cool. And at one point they said, oh, hip hop's dead. And I was like, cool, that's cool.
