Spring, 1549 Nagoya Castle, Owari Domain Inuchiyo! Don't overdo my eyebrows! Fix it! Katsusaburo. Make it higher and fuller. Higher! Taper the end, idiot. Kyosuke. The belt's boring. The rope. The rope! Quickly! A fake scar on your cheek would look heroic. No. No! I see... You're so dashing. Beautiful, my lord. Very gallant. How do I look, huh? I'd be smitten. It's so modern. I've got the shivers. I could... do this. This! I feel dizzy! Her knees will give in! You can have me! - What's that? - You can have me. What is it? They're here! Out of my way. Quite an entrance! Have a cup of sake, Your highness Lady No. No one else knows this, Son. I'm very ill. When I leave this world it'll bring chaos to our domain. The Viper will see it as an opportunity to invade. I have to stop that while I'm alive. It is time to negotiate an armistice between our domains. Son... You'll marry his daughter, Lady No of Mino Domain. People call her The Viper's daughter but her mother's from a noble family. I'm sure she'll make a good and sensible wife. The future of Owari Domain is on your shoulders, Son. I saw her! As your father said, she is fine looking! Who cares if people call her the Viper's daughter! I have a hunch that she's well-endowed! Inuchiyo! Calm down. Sorry. Keep it down. Right away! You're well-endowed too, my lord! My lady. Be sure to remember your father's words at all times. Sooner or later, your brother will revolt against me. That will turn this domain upside down. The Tiger next door will take advantage of that. My daughter. Your next husband will be the son of Lord Owari. Not a word! The future of our domain depends on you. He's reputed to be the biggest idiot in Owari but I'm sure he's educated and is a good swordsman. Quiet! Don't say anything! Please keep your mouth shut. You're too outspoken about your beliefs. Don't speak! What is it? The Lady awaits. My lord! Let us through. Good luck, my lord! Don't be stingy. Rub my shoulders. Not like that. Don't do it so softly... Ouch! May I ask why... Why must I pour your drink and massage your shoulders and feet? Because you're my wife. Are you tired? Me? No. You might not be but I'm tired after a long journey. A good husband would pour me a drink and massage my sore feet. Only wimps do that. Being thoughtful is not wimpy. You're so misguided. Watch your mouth. I detest women who don't know their place. And I detest men who are ignorant. You haven't learned any manners! I say the exact same thing to you! Excuse me? The way you're dressed, it's so foolish! This is... It's modern, you country bumpkin! You have no idea. You can't even handle liquor, you're just a kid. A little kid... It's embarrassing. I dare you to kill me right here! My father will be here with his army. Then my father and I'll kill him and invade his domain! What a joke! Did you forget that my father defeated yours? He was defeated along with his ego. Your father arranged this marriage to stop our attacks. Wrong. He sent me as part of his invasion plan. My father will defeat you soon. Mark my words. Really... It's treason! Let go! Damn... Mr. Hirate. Is the young lord always so vocal in these situations? Inuchiyo. He's fairly sensitive, sir. When he's not in control. Is the Lady... how can I put it? Is she passionate? Fairly. No, that really hurts! Stop it! It'll snap. You'll break it! You're killing me! Guards! Guards! Guards! Guards! My lord! I'm giving him a foot massage. Do you like it? You want it stronger? Don't stand there! Kill this woman! Just a moment please! Let him go, my lady! This is not right! Rescue our Lord! Please don't! She's wild! I guess she really is the Viper's assassin! This is her 3rd marriage. Her first 2 husbands died of unknown causes. The rumors are true. She killed them. You'd better stay clear of her, my lord. What's that look? Me, sir? My apologies, my lord. Like people say, the firstborn son is a vacuous wimp. This domain is ours to take! Don't be so quick! My lady, listen to me. When Father gives the order, I'll kill him in his sleep. Shut up, would you? Spring, 1551 Owari Nobuhide's funeral Are you planning to kill someone? Let's continue, Heisuke. Look at this. I bet your father doesn't have such a beautiful hawk. Quite right. No one's ever seen such an impressive hawk. I'll give you some of its prey. Get your pot ready. Don't bother. You've never brought back enough to share. What's that? The truth. You've never hunted with a hawk, woman! That's right, I haven't because I never had to. What? I've spent my entire life on Mount Inaba with my father. Falconry is just a game. I could get that many birds with a bow and arrow. Bring my bow and arrow! What do you intend to do, Lord? Don't you get it? This is a scheme. Killing her would cause an uproar but if she slipped off a cliff... She might die... By accident! Lord? Who's the better hunter? I challenge you. I accept. There's one! Where...? Lord. I can see! Make a noise! Hit the gong! Too soon! The Lady got one! He let her! Right, Lord? I won't talk. Your timing's off. Pick it up. The Lady got another one! Almost...! Another one! Another one! The wind. The wind blew it away. No! You can't do that, Lord! That's not funny, Lord. The Lady got another one! I don't eat birds. That bow's useless. You guys got in my way! Lord. What? Lord! There's a deer...! Go around it. Yes, Lord! Get the horses ready! Quickly! It's mine. Approach it from the west! Go from the other side! Are you hurt? Get my men! Now! I don't need the help of a woman! There's no time for that! Grab my hand. Move! I can save myself. Don't be a baby! If you fell, you'd die. Dying is better than getting your help. Oh, really? Come back and help me! I can't hang on any longer. Here. Hurry up! Don't tell anyone about this. No matter what! Is anything amusing? The sea. Huh? What about the sea? It might be nothing to you but there's no sea where I come from. Shipping brings great fortune. You want to take our ports? - Yes! - I won't let you. I want access to the sea so I can go beyond it. What's beyond it? Foreign lands! Barbarians. What would you do there? I don't know. What's there? I don't know. I just... I have an urge to go there. 1556 Renovating Kiyosu Castle It's sturdily built. Let my father know about any weak spots so he can seize the castle. Sadaie, what method of attack would you use? Let me see... My lady. Kitsuno. I wanted you to be the first to know, my lady. It's embarrassing but... I'm pregnant with the Lord's baby. Heavens! Congratulations! Well done. I hope it's a healthy boy. I appreciate your kind words. What a happy occasion. Mr. Sadaie! Is that so? Hurry! Sakuma and his men are late! So be it! I will get the General's head. We'll lead the troops! Get ready, men! The Lord is here! Prepare his horse! The Lord will ride. Ready, Sanzaemon. When they arrive, send them our way. Halt! Halt! You're going to Mino Domain with your army? Yes. Revoking the armistice would be a mistake! If you take on my father be prepared to lose. You're mistaken, my lady. He's right. Your father and brother are fighting. I'll help your father. Not for you but to keep to our truce, so move. I'm coming too. Don't be a fool! Messengers! The enemy has killed... your father. Should we go, my lord? Wait! We'll stand by. Stand by? Are you a coward? Get it back! That's my homeland! It's not so easy! I'll do it then. Get my horse! We're leaving, Sadaie! Stop her from going! My lady... My lady! My lady! My lady! Don't do it...! Stay away. I've completed the duty that bound me. That's not all. I'm the enemy lord's sister. I'll be used for political advantage. I'd rather kill myself. Your duty now is... to be my wife! Keep your eye on her. My lady... May 18, 1560 Shibata Gonroku. I love your beard. Yes? What is it? Suruga Domain took both Narumi and Kutsukake castles. Lord Imagawa Yoshimoto himself leads armies of 45000 soldiers. 45000 soldiers! By tomorrow he'll have seized Marune and Washizu forts. Then he'll come to us! This is the end. There's no hope...! Inoko Hyosuke has secured the evacuation route. Escape now. It'll rain heavily tomorrow, my lady. Now is the time to escape. There can't be 45000... My lady! The Lord is in the meeting but he's being indecisive. What chance would he have against the Imagawa army? He'd lose, is what. All he cares about is his appearance. His retainers will desert him for sure. Owari Domain is doomed. Oh I worry about Owari. It's not what you think... I wasn't making fun of the situation! Don't be upset! My lady! You look like you've been beheaded. Having your last laugh? What did you decide on? I didn't know what to propose. It is so hopeless? At the rate my soldiers are leaving. One way of stopping the war is by killing myself now. What a boring life it's been... My father used to say... he'd destroy the Oda clan then the Matsudaira clan then the Imagawa clan before seizing Kyoto. What a foolish fantasy. - If I were you... - What would you do? I would rather take on Lord Imagawa single-handedly than sit here and die. It's easy to be a woman! You can fantasize all you want. A viper can kill an ox with one bite on a vulnerable spot. Their army has no vulnerabilities. They do. Think how they'd think. They think their army will never lose. That's their weakness... Where are they? At Kutsukake Castle on their way to Otaka Castle. Ambush them at Washizu and Marune forts. What nonsense! They'll get there before us. I'll pull my soldiers back from the forts and defend this castle. Impossible. You have no reinforcements. Your soldiers are fleeing so you'll die if you stay here. Go on the offensive. How about we pretend to assemble at the forts? Go on. In the meantime, move the main army... Engage the enemy at Okehazama, kill their lord. What if they didn't come? That's the risk. If they did come, how would we ambush them? In rain. Rain? Tomorrow's rain will be so intense they won't hear you approach. Stars are out. My lady-in-waiting is never wrong about rain. I can't bet on that. You have to. Our forces are outnumbered... Keep their spirits high. Boost their morale! Empower them with your words! My words? With my words... I call on you! Give your lives to me! Charge! That won't stir up anyone except you. How would the Viper do? Everyone, listen to me carefully. The Imagawa soldiers are exhausted after marching all night. They don't have your vigor. Heaven will decide who'll win! Pull back if they come to you. Move in if they pull back. Push, pull and rip their formation apart! It's as easy as it sounds! If you're standing when we win, you bring honor to your family for generations! Victory is ours if you want it! Matasuke. Don't mention that I was here. It should appear that the Lord decided on his own. Let people know that he did the Atsumori dance and put on his armor. They are back! Men! Mino Domain is next! We'll get Mino back! Mino Fall, 1567 It hasn't changed! The hills, fields and rivers! And Inabayama Castle. I'll change the name though. Gizan... Giyou... Gifu... The hill with an expansive view. I name it Gifu. This is Gifu Castle. You're so flashy. You don't have to live here. You can have Mount Sagi. You grew up in that area. It's yours to use as you desire. I see. Now you have Mino Domain I have no value as a hostage. You don't have to be the wife of a man you don't like. Likewise. You should celebrate being free of a wife you dislike. Indeed. Does this mean divorce? All you have to do is ask and I'll see to it. It's not my claim to make. You should ask for it. You ask for it. You ask. How stubborn... Lord! What is it, Goroza? Lord Wada wants a secret meeting with you. What for? I suspect that it's about Lord Ashikaga Yoshiaki's visit to Kyoto. Lord Ashikaga...? He hopes to be installed as shogun and wants your help. He wants... who? You, Lord. Me go to Kyoto with Lord Ashikaga? He wants to partner with you to restructure the shogunate. Lord, I don't think this will benefit you. Lord Takeda and Lord Uesugi refused. He came to you because you're famous after the Battle of Okehazama. I advise you not to be impulsive, Lord. Only a fool would go for it. I won't succumb to flattery. Very wise of you, Lord. Owari's biggest idiot might do it. Be quiet. Don't say irrelevant things. Is this a foolish fantasy? Acquire as much land as we can and reach for the highest power. That's what my father and I wanted. Through you, I can acquire it. Speed is crucial. Waste no time in reaching Kyoto. Before they build blockades. Build a road! So we can move in a large army. There will be enemies to defeat before we reach Kyoto. Recruit any enemy soldiers who surrender. Making your army larger as you go! We'd need to have a lot of money and rice. Do we? No, but we'll be with Ashikaga shogun's clan. We can confiscate all we want. Our first obstacle is Lord Azai. We need him as an ally. I'll marry off my sister to him. And we need steel and horses! Kyoto Fall, 1568 Allow me to be in your presence. Look at this! This is a treasure trove! Suitable for a man of your status. You smartass. Tokichiro. Look at him. He works for the Western missionaries. I'll be damned! He'd make a powerful soldier. I'll hire him. Show him what's required. As you wish, Lord. By the way, Lady No has arrived. She's here? Let her in. This way, my lady. How was the trip? How did you find Kyoto? Look at the piles of gifts! Aristocrats and merchants gave me these fine artifacts. Can you see him? He works for the Westerners... What happened? What do you mean? Your face... I don't want to seem provincial. Aren't I elegant? Yes, you're ele... eleg... It wasn't me! Tokichiro laughed first. You were first, Lord. - Shut up, monkey! - I was laughing with you. Stop it, my lady! You're making it funnier! My stomach's killing me! I'm going home! Wait a minute! My stomach hurts... Are you okay, Lord? Tokichiro, I have a favor to ask of you. Listen, everyone. I'll be having a private talk with the Lord and Lady so keep everyone out. Sadaie, you can go back to your quarters. Don't worry, I'll walk with Lady No. I'll stay here. Go back. Lower your eyes. Hello! Take your time. We have what you want. Want that frog? How much is it? It's 500 mon. Take it. May I...? Thank you, sir. See the westerners? Westerners! What a strange dance! Would you like to try some, sir? I like it! - It's candy. - How much is it? I'm dizzy. What's that? Watch it! Try some of this candy... A pickpocket! Get out of my way! Kid, stop! - You stole my candy! - Wait! Mokichi. You're back! Give me that! - Give it back! - What's that? What a mess...! How dare you steal from me, kid? Let go! This belongs to me! Let's go. They stink... Don't be rude! We should go. Move. That hurts! Forget it. Don't! Leave the kid alone! That's a silly move... Kill her! Stay tough, Viper's daughter! That's mine! Leave my wife alone! Up there. Come on! In here. Here. May 21, 1570 We can almost see the castle! Hang on! You can make it back! Lord Akechi Jubei Mitsuhide made it back! Saito Hideomi died in action. Toda Genzo died in action. Kokubo Shozaburo and Koichiro. Harada Sukeroku also died in action. Asano Shokichi and Heisuke died in action. Also Asano Inosuke died. Why did they have to die? Azai Nagamasa betrayed us! How could he stage a mutiny? I blame Mr. Gonroku. Takigawa, how dare you! Order! The wrath of the warlords is against you as you approach Kyoto. I knew it was a bad idea... And you share that with us now, Niwa? I'll behead you next time. Tokichiro and Akechi. You fought well at the rear. I appreciate your recognition, Lord! It's too soon for compliments. It's time to strike. I know. We'll reorganize and leave immediately. And behead Azai Nagamasa! I'm back. Do you feel better? I'm sorry about the baby... You'll have another chance. Another chance? I'm too old... to bear another child. You don't know that. Aren't you sad to have lost a child? I guess you aren't. You already have many children. The ones you had with beautiful Kitsuno and pretty Nabe. I'm sure you never wanted my child from the start. You thought you had enough! Stop that petty nonsense! I'm fighting a war. I lost so many men this time. I carry on my shoulders thousands of soldiers' lives and my people. A baby is nothing in comparison. Lord, if I may speak to you directly. Please forgive her rudeness. She was euphoric to have conceived your child. Every day she sewed baby clothes... So what? You could speak to her in a more heartfelt way, Lord. Sadaie. At this time... I have no heart. Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei Retreat now! Pull out! That's a loser's mindset! Do not pull back! Advance! Burn it down. Men, women, children... Kill everyone. But Lord... - Women and children... - Kill them all. Kill them... Those monks... Why do they support that traitor, Azai, and go against me? Why do religious leaders seek political power? I'll be punished for your sins if I have to... so burn every one of them. I don't think that's what a decent man would do... I haven't been one for a long time. I am not a man! I'm King of the Sixth Heaven demons! Well said, Lord. You have to be a demon king to replace the shogun or emperor. Let me, Akechi Jubei Mitsuhide, perform this task, Lord. Do it right. Excuse us, my lady. What is it? We have a favor we'd like to ask of you. What brought you? I don't know about destroying a Buddhist temple. Don't be mistaken. Those ogres eat animal flesh, sleep with women and kill people! Even so, killing women and children will anger many. I don't care. You'll antagonize more people. Then I'll kill them. Even the shogun is upset by your deeds. He's a useless fool. I'll expel him from Kyoto. If he opposes me... I'll kill him. There must be a smarter way... But you're the biggest idiot in Owari. Yes, I'm not smart enough to think any other way. That's pathetic. I can help you if... No. Is Gonroku behind this? Or Goroza? They thought I'd listen to you? The battle between Owari and Mino was simple... There's no time for games. There's no place for you in our accomplishments. New Year, 1574 We gather together to wish for more fortune in the new year. Your retainers will work tirelessly to realize Lord Nobunaga's plan to unify the whole of Japan. We will be your loyal retainers forever and ever. It's time to celebrate! You'll prosper like a growing pine tree You'll prosper like a growing tree It's time to celebrate! You know who our lord is? The best in Japan, next to none Join me, Lord. That's enough, monkey! Next! It's your turn, Akechi Jubei. Do your trick. What have you got? I'm but a boring man with no amusing skills. So I prepared a very special new year drink. Bring them! These are the skulls of your enemies, gilded with gold leaf. The skulls of Asakura Yoshikage, Azai Hisamasa and Nagamasa. I've never had such delicious sake, Akechi. I'm humbled. Drink up, everyone! You forgot that you can't drink. Stand up! You'll catch a cold out here. Your face... It's become so scary. Has anyone killed as many people as you? How many wars will you fight? How many will die? What's your point? My lady-in-waiting gave me dried persimmons. She and her husband went to the mountain and found a persimmon tree. Her husband ate too many persimmons and got an upset stomach. What's your point? They're a couple! Many husbands and wives spend their lives like that. Why are you telling me that now? You told me to go to Kyoto. It was your idea! There's no turning back. Until the day the whole of Japan has peace... I'll kill until no one can oppose me! Until then I won't be able to sleep soundly. My foe will kill me or I'll kill them. That's the path I've chosen. Go away. Go away! I don't understand it myself. I only married him so I could kill him... like I did with my other husbands. After my father died, I used the Lord to achieve my own ambitions. As a result he is on his way to the top. Everything is as I planned. So why...? What's wrong with me? I'm fretful. It's become unbearable. Something's become more important to you than your ambitions. My lady. You've grown to love the Lord. I... love him...? Seeing the man you love go through struggles makes you fret, my lady. But he hates me. I don't want to be here anymore. You want to see me, Lord. It's beautiful... but it's a sad song. I think I finally understand why... I always wanted to go to the land beyond the seas. I wanted to live a different kind of life. Where no one knows anything about me. Free from my name and my family. I'd live a different life. A foolish fantasy. My lord. You once said that if I asked you for a divorce, you'd see to it. Let me ask you then. I'd like to leave you, my lord. I accept. I divorce you right here and now. Do as you wish. Thank you, Lord. Find a good husband and have a good life. You're good. She certainly is. It's nothing. Nagashino-shitaragahara Lord! Woman. Why do you hast to die? Don't! Don't! Don't! Take me with you. Take me with you instead! Come back! Come back! Come back! Come back! Come back! Come back. Come back. Lord, you're awake. Give it back! You're exhausted. You hardly slept for many days. Ranmaru... What was everything for...? I killed any enemy who challenged me. I built a castle like no other in Azuchi. I achieved so much that even the Emperor admires me. Yes, Lord. What for? What was it for...? To unify the whole of Japan. Lord! Speak. Mr. Sadaie has returned. I'm opening the door. My lady. Open the door for the guest please. Go away! Why is he here? I don't want him to see me like this. Why wasn't I told sooner? She didn't want to bother you... Sadaie, you did not treat her as a husband should. But Lord, if I may. I haven't touched her once in the last seven years. What? I gave you an order. How dare I... Knowing how deeply the Lady loves you I wouldn't dare touch her! Go away! Don't look at me. Come with me to Azuchi. We're not married now... Enough of that. Just come! I'll make you better. I don't need it! I don't want your pity. Who brought him here? My lady. My lady. Look at his face. Can you see how exhausted and miserable he is? Who needs help? It is he who needs help. The Lord is asking for your help, my lady. Am I right, my lord? Please... Please be by my side. Up there. Behold! This is the Azuchi Castle's keep. It's one of a kind! See the view. It's like looking down from heaven. This is vulgar. Vulgar? For all the climbing I had to do! This is the latest look from Western architecture... Only an overexcited kid would build this! You're a kid! It's embarrassing! You don't look so pale. You and your antics make the blood rush to my head! I made an herb garden on Mount Ibuki. I grow medicinal herbs from the thousands of seeds I collected. There's no sickness that can't be cured. This is from a Western herb. Drink it. Here... Go on. It stinks! Why don't you try it? Of course it doesn't stink. See? Don't concern yourself with me. You have a lot to do. But I want to do this. I know but no one else can take on your responsibility. All my sons are capable. There's Gonroku, Niwa, Akechi and Hideyoshi. Don't worry about me. Focus on getting better. 1582 Lord. Lord! What? We'll proceed as I proposed if you are in agreement, Lord? About what? About the reception for Lord Tokugawa. Do as you like. Lord! Unifying Japan is a critical topic... As if I don't know that! Lord, how is it that you allowed a retainer to yawn in that discussion? Lord Tokugawa is very observant. If he no longer saw you as a threat, he'd revolt. I beseech you. You must remind everyone that you're the fearful demon king. How? By putting me in charge of the reception. What a grand castle! I might topple over looking up at the top! It's like it's competing with Mount Fuji! This is delicious. It's a delicacy for a countryman from Mikawa. The fish smells, Akechi Jubei. Does it, Lord? Don't eat it, Lord Tokugawa. It might make you unwell. I'm sorry... That's inadequate! Jubei. You almost jeopardized Lord Tokugawa's life. You fool... It's inexcusable! You embarrassed me in front of everyone! Who do you think you are? You'll never enter this room again! That was good. Mmm, this is delicious. I messed up. Everyone froze in fear. It was effective. Forgive me. How are you? Remember this? We saw foreigners play one in Kyoto. I took this one. It's not easy... You have a better chance. You learn quickly. Where are you going? To Kyoto. The Shikoku invasion has stalled. They need me to lead it. Come with me to Kyoto. I'll have a tea party at Honno-ji Temple. I won't be long. If these campaigns go well that'll end the whole thing. No more wars for me. When I return we'll take the foreigner's ship to their land. Where no one knows anything about us. Free from our names and family. That's why... you must get better. What is it? You want this? This will... make sure that you return safely. A good luck charm. So I'll leap home like a frog? I won't need this. Of course I'll return to you. This helped me come back to you. I challenge you to learn to play this then. By the time I return, learn to play a Western tune. I accept. I'll see you. Honno-ji Temple June 2, 1582 Out of devotion I followed the lead of the mad king. But now he's just a man, not a demon king. A mere man can't rule a unified Japan. My lord. I'll finish what you started. Enemy attack! - We're under attack. - Who are they? It is in fact, Lord Akechi's army. Akechi Jubei? Akechi...! This way! Women escape from the back! There's Lord Nobunaga! Behead him! Set it on fire! Hurry! Burn it! Lord! Watch out! This way! Get out of my way! I must return! Even if I'm dead I won't let you have my head! To the back. Lord! I must take my own life. I've returned. Let's go. Vamos! Stay by my side. My lady? 50 years of life is nothing but a dream when compared... to the lives of those who dwell in Heaven. Anyone alive in this world is bound to perish. We all perish. I've always... I've always loved you.
