JULIET OF THE SPIRITS - Should I light the candles, signora? - No, she'll do it. Right. I'll light them. Are you wearing the red one? I like the blond one better. Teresina, I can choose my wig myself. Sorry, signora. I love the blond one. But this one suits you too. Which shoes do you want to wear, signora? I'm wearing them already, Teresina. I really wanted to give you a present, but I sent my money home. Never mind. Next time. This one looks really pretty on you. It doesn't. I look awful. I won't wear any. I'm sick of this dress. Throw it out. This thing too. Here, you can have it. Signora, did your husband say what he's buying you for your anniversary? Your gift for him is so beautiful. Signora, your husband's here. Get off the bed, you. Hurry, he's in the garden already. Let me try it. Teresina, quick, my dress. You know, signora, I feel so excited. How beautiful. Is it all set in there? - Is it all right? - Light the candles. His gift is under his napkin. You only have one earring on. I left it in the bathroom. Get it, please. Turn off the lights. What's the matter? ls the power out? Well, what's happening? What are you all doing there? You're right. I'm so sorry. It's so beastly of me. To think I even wrote it down. But I have a surprise too. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It's our wedding anniversary. Juliet, look who's here. Happy anniversary! It's their anniversary. Look, honey. Turn the lights on. Look what Val brought you from Los Angeles. Thanks. What is it? It's a charm against spirits. It repels negative forces. You must hang it here. - Hi, Juliet. - Let me look at you. It's been 15 years, my friends. Fifteen years. That dog's been so nervous for the past two or three days. Down! Juliet, I forgot to introduce Genius, the greatest clairvoyant on earth. My dear signora, I know everything about you. You're an Aquarius, right? Lots of famous people are. - A pleasure to see you, Juliet, as usual. - Don't be bothersome. Trust me, astrology is a fascinating science. Say, girls! What's cooking? Excuse me, Juliet. Why don't you make us something? - Well, what? - Anything. They've made up. Every time this fool opens her mouth, she drives me insane. I think he's right. There's no need to buy food. I'll cook. I'll make my famous pilaf a la Dolores. Have you got any paprika, Juliet? - Chili pepper. - Even better. - Let me help. No, it's a secret recipe. Sculpting, cooking and making love - my three vocations. - Have you found your conquering angel? - I didn't expect to cook today. I'm Cesarino. I think I saw you at Vigor, the gym. - Never been there. - Where's the tomato sauce? I did some bodybuilding too. Let's check here. Romolo, lift me up. Why is it that one loses all his muscles when he stops going to the gym? What's up, handsome? - It's all here in the cards, see. - Is that so? You're so mysterious, not even my cards can read you. - What should we do, signora? - Do we have to feed them all? Sure, they're our guests. Where's Mrs. Juliet? Can I go? Don't be silly and start crying. Genius, come feel Juliet's vibes. You look like a doll tonight. I've got so much to tell you. - Excuse me, wait a second. Dear counselor, your sister's issues are no mystery. The Indians already knew everything. - Let me in. Like the Egyptians, the Etruscans and the Chinese. So don't be afraid to send her to me. I'll be waiting for her. Right, last night I dreamt - I'm sorry. - This is not the right time. - Hold on. - Another time, Val. - Sit down. He'll do the pendulum. Clear your mind of all thoughts. Take off my jacket, Valentina. Yes, maestro. Things are taking a good turn. A strong magnetic charge. This house is so strange, Juliet. Who lived here before you? The pendulum reaction is positive, see? It's moving clockwise. - Who's there? - Me. It's not a good time. - What are you up to in here? - Nothing. Are you bad-mouthing me? What's up, Juliet? - Don't just walk in. It's a shock. Sorry for bringing so many people home without warning you. They dropped by my office suddenly. What could I do? You did well. They're such nice friends. Giorgio. Yes? Do you love me? Good luck to you both! Hooray! To the bride and groom! - Are you married? - Would I cheer for the spouses if I were? Oh, no. Lying is much more heroic. We'll give you a gold medal then. Does the lady know she's living with a hero? Sit around the table. Don't cross your legs. I'll purify the air in the meantime. Cutie... No cats. They attract restless souls. Shut up. You can do your seance on my pecker. You two can go to bed now. - Yes, signora. - Thank you. Good night. She said she wouldn't do these things anymore. It scares me so. Go. Go ahead. Good night. I feel many presences. They've already gathered around us. I'm sorry. It's the incense. Focus. Create your inner void. I feel a new presence. Somebody who's never been here is trying to communicate. Is the charge sufficient, maestro? Tell it to fill my bottle. It's empty. One... Don't breathe. Two... A longer step, longer. One... Here it is. Speak to it, maestro. Spirit, would you tell us your name? It said "I"... "R"... - "H"... - "I"... - Didn't it say "H"? - Shut up. It said "I". "Iris." It's a woman. Iris. Such a pretty name. I wonder who she was. Could you tell us who you are? Gorgeous. She said she's gorgeous. Right, maestro? Yes, she did. Iris, listen. Are you here with a message for us? She said, "Love for everybody." Yes, I support that. I agree. That's nice, right? - What did she say? -"Love for everybody." - That's an illusion. What a sweet message. Listen, Iris, could you tell us - What is it? - An interference perhaps. Are you still there, Iris? It said, "No." Let's listen. Who are you? Olaf. He said his name is Olaf. You're Turkish. Am I right? He said you're Turkish. No, I'm not Turkish. Although I would've loved to be. What did he say? He said, "Troia" Ah, Troy. The ancient Greek city. Is that where you're from? No, he said he's not. Why don't you send each of us a message? Something nice, to help us through this life. What can you tell our friend Dolly, for example? -"Whore." - No, you've misunderstood me. Trollop. He says, "Big trollop." Thanks. It isn't really an insult. - What did he say? - He said, "Big trollop." Poor soul, rest in peace. Professor, send him on his way. Hello? Hello? Who's this? They hung up. A message for you, Juliet. "Who do you think you are? You're nothing. You don't mean a thing to anybody. You're a derelict." Hold it. Don't break the chain. It's dangerous. - What's happening? - Who's feeling ill? - Juliet. - Switch the light on. Now. - Don't touch her. - You're too old for this rubbish. She was receiving an otherworldly message. She's not here now. She's empty. - Drink some water. Olaf, leave now. Yes, I understand. Ciao. - Giorgio. - I'm here, silly. - You gave us such a fright. - The professor has a bad effect on ladies. This lady is very gifted. Very, very gifted. Elisabetta. Yes, signora? Has my husband left? He just left, signora. He said he didn't want to wake you because you were up so late. He said he won't be home for lunch. The nanny took your nieces to the beach. - Good morning, signora. - Good morning. I'm cleaning the pond. The leaves clog the drains. Bravo, Gasperino. Beautiful day, isn't it? I'd like to fly Into the arms of my beauty I'd like to fly... - Teresina. - Yes, signora? - Go away. I was talking to the plumber - - Right. He's from my village. The water tank is still very noisy. "For everybody." "Love for everybody." - Shall I serve breakfast in the garden? - Yes. Thank you. Good morning, signora. I'll set the table right away. Iris? Have you ever been on a plane? Ever heard radio transmissions on a plane? The ether is full of voices giving and canceling orders. Human voices, voices full of phlegm. It's not spirits, my dear signora. Such naivety is offensive to reason. They're electric fields, unidentified substances. Couldn't they be communications from other planets? - You, be quiet. - Let me speak. I read in Reader's Digest - Be quiet. In any case, as a doctor, I'd advise you against these experiments. Listen, Doctor. As a child, I'd just shut my eyes and I would see - As a child, I'd close my eyes and see balls. In beautiful colors. Really? Good for you. Castles, nocturnal plants, forests and little tiny faces. They stared at me with sparkling eyes. I was afraid. Still, it was beautiful. It went on for years, and then it stopped. I just had to close my eyes... What if I told you it was just indigestion? When we die, we're a pile of dust. If any bones are left, the cat may get us. Take a swim, buy a horse, jump obstacles. But above all, tell your husband to make love more often. Nothing's better for spirits and toothaches. Yes, I know, Doctor. Now there's a real vision. The kind of vision even I believe in. Raffaello, sit down. Please. I'd like having them day and night. She's our neighbor, but we're not really acquainted. Ildegarda. You may not be acquainted, but I'd love to be. Mademoiselle, go fetch the girls, please. Rossella, Sabrina. What are you doing there? Don't disturb the lady, or she'll get angry. - What about me? - Thank her. Let's go, girls. I'm going for a swim, signora. Our dear Juliet sees magic everywhere. "A happy life reigned in Catherine's home. Her husband adored her. Her children were growing up strong and hardworking. Naturally, the men in the village set her as an example for their wives. The women began dreading her, like smoke in their eyes." Juliet... please help me. I'm Old. Besides, it concerns you. Doctor... Doctor, help me. Juliet, the lady over there sent us this lovely fruit basket. Wasn't that nice? Juliet. - Did you say something, madame? - No. I didn't say a thing. Stop running. Come here. There was a headless fish in the sea this morning, Mom. Auntie Juliet said that if we return it to the sea, his head would grow back. - Did you swim? Aunt Sylva, we saw a fish without a head. Hold still, don't touch. You're filthy. Ciao, Juliet. I wonder when I can get a house here too. You're so pale. The little one is completely pale. Didn't she get any sun? Don't you remember what the doctor ordered? At least two hours of sun each day. With our heads reclining We lose ourselves in a sad flight In destiny's breath That blows through our hair Ciao, Sylva. What a nice surprise. Adele was coming to fetch the girls, so we came along. Mother's here too. Ciao, Mom. You're running around the pinewood in this heat? We were going home. The heat isn't so bad. - Don't. You're perspiring. - Are you having lunch with me? No. Rehearsal's at 3:00 at the studio. It's 2:00 already. We're late. When do we have to be at Luciana's? At 4:00. Then it's the dressmaker. Did they bother you? No, they were good company. We had fun together, you know? You look so good, Sylva. You think so? I lost four pounds. The director wanted me thinner. It's pretty here. How's the nightlife? Well, there isn't much to do. I'm usually tired, so we prefer staying in. On that note, your husband is shameless. He called me and invited me to dinner to impress some managers from Venezuela. I said I'd be glad to come with my boyfriend. And he says, "Well, next time then." What gives? Is he ever home? He comes in at night. He works a lot, you know? He works so hard. Won't he get burned out? But he said he'll take a nice holiday soon. Maybe we'll go on a cruise together. Spain, Greece. He hasn't decided. But I already have all the brochures. - Really? - We're really going this time. Go on, honey. Your nanny's calling you. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, darling. Bye, sweetheart. - Bye, gorgeous. - Oscar, I'll sit in front. I feel sick. - Bye, Sylva. - Bye, Juliet. - Bye, Auntie Sylva. My umbrella. My pretty umbrella. Remember to watch the TV Saturday night. You're little sister's on. I have a great part, you know? See you Sunday. Bye, Mom. What is it? Nothing, just looking at you. Why don't you put on some makeup, some lipstick? You're right, but we were at the beach. Take better care of yourself. Repeat this horizontal movement with your eyes... Signora, look at Elisabetta. Don't move your head, just your eyes. Wait a second. - Try doing the same vertically. Like this. Keep going, faster. Give this ocular exercise 15 days and your eyes will sparkle again like two pure gems. Elisabetta, set up a tray by the TV. - No, darling, I'm not hungry. What a tough day. What's this program? Not even a slice of cake? No, I don't want anything. I had something at the office. Sit down here for a while. ...always needs a pretty voice and perfect diction. We recommend this exercise. - Are you tired? - Yes, a little. Try to pronounce the following words. From now on, talk to me like she does, Teresina. - Pineapple, consequential, Domodossola... - Isn't that funny? ...exemption, essential and success. Repeating this exercise has helped some of the best actresses be successful. I was at the beach today, you know? Now the weekly horoscope for Gemini... And? I told the doctor about last night. He made fun of me, and I... What? Never mind. Ladies and gentlemen, good night. Tomorrow, my dear, I'm going to be very busy again. Elisabetta, call me at 7:00. Have the car ready by 7:30. - Yes, sir. - I think I won't be here for lunch either. Wake up, Teresina. Teresina? Wake up. I wasn't asleep. I was just thinking. Right. You lock the doors upstairs. We'll take care of things here. Yes, signora. I suspect Sofia is pregnant again. Again? This cat is shameless. Get out. Go visit your lover. - Good night, signora. - Keep the volume of the radio low. Signora, could I go back into town tomorrow morning just for a short visit? What time would you get back? Same as yesterday evening? No, I'll be back early, signora. - All right then. Good night. - Good night. I'd love to know why you go into town every day. Gabriella... What did you say, darling? Who's Gabriella? Tell me, who is Gabriella? Good morning, honey. Sleep well? Don't start smoking first thing in the morning. I'm having lunch with the Brazilians. I've been putting it off for two days. It's important business. What are you doing? You told me not to smoke. I put it out. Ciao, my little star. You look great. My back is killing me. Who is Gabriella? - What? - Yes, Gabriella. I don't understand. Who is Gabriella? Last night, you said "Gabriella" twice in your sleep. Really? The book I was looking for. You could've put it back. You must have been dreaming about her. Who is she? Do I happen to know her? Who are you speaking of? I don't know any Gabriella. You must have misunderstood. Bye, darling. I'll try to get back early. I'll call you in any case. Going to the seashore? Hello? Go to hell. I'm sorry. Somebody's been calling and hanging up three or four times a day. - What? - Nothing. When he returns from Venezuela, repentant, she says, "So, you're back now?" Gabriella. I heard it all right. He said, "Gabriella." Still, he looked so innocent when he denied it. True, he likes women. Am I right, signora? One has to learn to put up with it. You can't force others to do what you want. No, you poor darling. I believe what they tell me. If they say "yes," it can't mean "no," then "yes," then "I don't know." Right, signora? One should not be arrogant. What about these phone calls? "Hello?" But nobody ever answers. Gabriella... Could it be the lady he once brought home? No, she wasn't named Gabriella. Of course, in his job, he's always surrounded by easy women. Still, he once told me, "I will never lie to you. Never." Your little house is a dream by day. Watch the dog. There are cats everywhere. Enchanting. Such an intoxicating perfume. Look at the dew. This is dew, isn't it? My God, such purity. My heart aches, it's all so beautiful. I'd like to roll around naked in it. Why don't you? I can't. We've become so complicated, so uncivilized. Ciao, stellina. What are you doing? It's wet here though. Isn't the humidity bad for your rheumatism? Down, down! No, dear, don't get up. Sit here, Valentina. Move the peppers. Darling. What are you doing? Storing peppers for winter. In a wreath? Oh, a wreath of peppers. Such a good little housewife. I am totally useless. I'm so ashamed. Why am I this way, eh? I feel so uprooted, so adrift. You see, peppers are a tiny thing. Yet, if I could do it, it might save me. Let's go, Teresina. Nobody made lunch this morning. Will you stay with me, Val? Wake up, Teresina. It's almost noon. Why don't you go to bed earlier? - What? Noon? I was supposed to meet Ranieri at 11:00 in the Piazza di Spagna. - Teresina, turn the oven on. - We have such fights if I'm late. Dear, I'm off, but I'll see you at 5:00. At 5:00? Where? Didn't I tell you? That's why I came. You must join us at all costs this afternoon. You can't say no. You must be there. But where? Bishma. Bishma is going to be at the Plaza at 5:00. He's only here for two days. He comes to Europe once every seven years. Did you know he has crowds of disciples in the US? Schools, clubs. It's an event. - Really? - Hold still. It's a unique event. Aren't you familiar with his experiments? Never heard of them. Where have you been? He's a fabulous clairvoyant. An initiate. A man-woman enclosing the secret of both sexes. He's unique in the world. He's an oracle. He enlightens you. He can change your life, reveal all. - He's an Indian? -Indian, Chinese, Tibetan - who cares? Bishma belongs to the world. Bye, darling. - Bye. Be careful, Juliet. You can't miss meetings with fate. Maybe he's here just for you. I can't go. I'd feel sorry if I were to miss a call from Giorgio. - You'll regret it, Juliet. - Don't wait for me. It wasn't easy, you know? Nobody asked you to book an appointment for me. The electricity's out. Bishma's apartment? The meeting's on the terrace. Show the ladies the way. The elevator's broken. We'll take the stairs. Let's forget about it, Valentina. Are there lots of people? Has it started already? I don't know, signora. Let's go. Got your questions ready? Questions? What questions? I'm not asking any. When I was little, my dad told me this hotel was for - - Elena. - I was dreading the stairs in the dark. Hello, my angel. - It has all come to pass, you know? - Of course. That same night, I dreamt of him. No robe though. What does it mean? My dearest children, these are not abstruse concepts. It's no more than the most human of recipes for happiness. In marriage, fidelity is not merely a duty for the spouses, it is their right as well. Love thy wife as thyself, my son. Because those who love their wives love themselves. Love one another for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. What are you staring at? There's a wedding banquet going on. How nice. My darling. He said the greatest miracle is eating when we are hungry. This is Go-Go. Valentina. And drinking when we're thirsty. Look at how he's aged. - His head is completely white. - Who are you talking about? Bishma. - What is this? - It's a fruit. That's the second step. It isn't real enlightenment though. So, what is this? The single spirit. That fruit is only appearance. But the real Buddha is beyond such differences. Is that right? Now we reach the third step. Now, though the truth is close and so far away at once. So, what is this? Isn't it an apple? Darling, you don't get it. We must look beyond appearances. The voice of the master will tell you what it is. It's an apple, just a humble apple, a little red and crushed on one side. But at the same time, it is the Buddha and the single spirit. Things become things again, and the enlightened being sees their multiplicity and unity all at once, appearance and substance. Do heaven and hell exist? - Who are you? - An American painter. Let me see too. Cut my head off. Go on, cut off her head. It's one of the fables of the great master Lao-tse. Don't hesitate. Cut it off. Behold the gates of hell opening. And now the gates of heaven. What's happening? Let's not disturb him. He's conversing with his god. The lady called Juliet may enter. But on her own. Please sit. How is he? Where is he? He wants to see me alone. Go away. But I'm the one who brought you here. - All right, but he wants to speak to me. - Where is he? I don't know, the bathroom maybe. Wait outside. We've got an appointment. What... Juliet, do you know the Kama Sutra? Sexual intercourse is a conflict. To be happy, you must behave as if in combat. The place to be fought over is the body. The body? And within the body, the shoulders and the area between the breasts. The sound that must be produced during intercourse to procure pleasure is the "Hin." The great sigh. The sound "Put." The sound "Pat." What did he say? The sound "ls." The whining sound. The sound "Fut." And the sound "Plat." You might add sounds such as those produced by pigeons. By night doves. By bees... ducks, green sparrows, flamingos, quail and storks. Sounds that can be used depending on the occasion. The different kinds of bites are the blind bite, the breathy bite, the point, the point line, the coral jewel, the torn cloud, the wolf bite. Love is a religion, Juliet. Your husband is your god. You are the priestess of this cult. Your spirit must burn up like this incense, go up in smoke on the altar of your loving body. Now, if you have any questions, the master will gladly answer. Well, no, nothing. Here's what's happened. It's as if everything's been lost since last night. I'm afraid my husband has another woman. Why don't you learn to better please your husband, Juliet? I do please him. Do you remember me? I was born this way, donna d'amore. Am I not beautiful? Answer honestly. Am I not beautiful? - Yes, very beautiful. - I think so too. Have you seen my hair? I never comb it. I simply caress it. I love caressing myself. My skin is so white. İf I am in a bad mood, I go to the mirror. I turn and look at my back and I immediately feel happy again. Did you buy those stockings? - No. What stockings? The black fishnets. Women want to be treated like fairies, but they don't do their trade. - Is love a trade? - I didn't say "trade." I said "the art of love." - I heard it right. You said "trade." Whoring - some advice. Why don't you become beautiful like me? Who are you? Who are you? Olaf, go away. You must become beautiful like me. Female sensibility... You're pretty, Juliet. I want to kiss you. Bite me! Bite my breast! Harder! Love! Please stop! I want to leave. Let me out. - Calm down, signora. - I want to leave. Follow me. We shouldn't appeal to our inner forces without the necessary preparation. It can be extremely dangerous. But these spirits are generous, gentle and mild, though at times they might seem mischievous. Good evening, signora. Were your omens good? - Yes, thank you. - Happy? Yes, thanks. Good luck. What did he tell you? What did you see? From out here, we heard - There's another message. He says something new will come to pass tonight, new and very beautiful. Sangria. It quenches the thirst of those who drink it. It quenches our secret thirsts too. They call it the potion of oblivion. Strange. That wasn't his voice. It was a soul speaking through him. Did you hear that? An extraordinary meeting. They told her she'd have an extraordinary meeting tonight. Aren't you happy? - Did you see her? - I thought so. - Did she say "I am Iris"? - No, but I felt it was her. I felt the same as on the night of our session. That's so strange. Who do you think she is? Who knows? Maybe the dancer who ran away with my grandad. A dancer and your grandad? He was a high school professor, and he fell for a beautiful dancer. What a beautiful child. What's your name? Tell her your name, Juliet. Did you see how brave this beautiful young lady was? She performed an extraordinary act. I wanted to express my full admiration. A beautiful lady makes me feel more pious. I don't know why, but I always thought they ran away on that circus plane. Professor De Filippis, in the name of God, stop! Come down at once. That's an order. I'm you're principal, and you'll be held accountable for this despicable behavior. Professor De Filippis! Due to that, the headmaster had him banned from every school in the country. He vanished for two years. Then he came back as happy as ever. But my mother wouldn't allow him to stay with us. I would only visit him at Christmas and always in secret. He told such funny stories. But he also frightened me a little. Because the bishop said he was one of the devil's disciples. I was still a child at his funeral. Mother didn't shed a tear. I remember her beautiful black dress. - She's a beauty. - Yes, she is. One night, I saw her in the corridor. She looked like a queen. Perhaps she was going to a ball with my father. Rosa Aurata. A name that sounds like a pretty verse. I used to grow them too. My garden in Cordoba was famous. You're very lucky. Flowers are grateful to those who tend to them. All these plants get lots of love. It shows. You must be a very loving person to give so much every day. Is this right, sir? Is this the one you wanted? Yes, thank you. Three slices of lemon, three of orange... mineral water. A glass, please. Here, signore. Not a champagne glass. An ordinary one. Teresina, get a large glass. Three teaspoons of sugar. Shall I give him this one, signora? Will this do? Thank you. In Valencia, they like to add a garlic clove, but in Cordoba they prefer a more delicate taste. Taste it, please, and tell me if you like it. Delicious. What's it called? Sangria. It quenches the thirst of those who drink it. It quenches our secret thirsts too. That's why they call it the potion of oblivion. You should stay at least a week. Have you already met? I often told you about Jose, remember? I was his guest in Spain. - When? Last year, in Castilla. He owns a fabulous palace. And you should see his paintings. He owns two Goyas. Were they by Goya or Velazquez? Neither. Rivera. Beautiful. He wanted to go to a hotel. But where else would he find the peace we enjoy out here? This silence? What matters is the fluidity of the movements. The balance. A good toreador must have a pure heart and clear thoughts, like monks or dancers. José owns one of the biggest bull farms in Spain. Sometimes, at night, this madman performs his own bullfights and kills a few bulls. What courage. Isn't it dangerous? No. It's a question of style and poetry. And poetry's never dangerous. My best friends are toreadors. They compose music, write verse and abhor blood. Cordoba's style in the arena is unrivaled harmony. May I? - Please. Please wait. Perhaps I have something more suitable. How's this for a mu/eta? Thank you. You see, the bull, he dies in his chimera. He is not killed by the sword but by the magic they use to elude him. The unhappy beast falls into the void, and I kill it with thrusts of illusion. Miss one step, one measure - like a rhyme in poetry - and you're faced with mortal danger. A spontaneity borne of calculation... a pure sentiment, a clear mind, an absolutely exact gesture, and the monster will be defeated. I didn't show you José's present from Spain. I'll get it. It's magnificent. "No one understood the perfume of the dark magnolia of your womb. No one knew you tormented a hummingbird of love between your teeth." You love Lorca's poetry, right? Destiny plays some strange games. I was in Madrid, and I didn't want to leave... because of a restless foreboding. Now I am happy to be here. There's nothing to life if you take away the harmony of nights like this. I owe you a happy moment and hope it will last. I didn't do much. It can be everything. Yes, a sudden decision, a meeting with an old friend who lives by the sea and feeling a lost sense of peace. Everything becomes clear, plausible. Juliet, what is it? Come here. Isn't this a great gift? It's a magic telescope. In any case, it seems to know the tastes of its purchaser very well. As soon as I looked into it, look what I saw. - Can I see? - Here you go. She's the lover of a Greek ship owner. He's worth about thirty billion. I can't see a thing. You need to calibrate it for your own sight. Last year, there was a scandal at their villa. She organizes these parties. The police were called in. They wanted to deport her. There are some fascinating stories about them. She's truly very beautiful. Going to bed already? I wanted to chat. - Did you say something? - It doesn't matter. - Good night, darling. - Good night. I'm going to read for a while. I also changed the color of the interior. That red reminded me of cardinals. Now it's black, and the seats are the color of tobacco. Do you like it? I told them, "Guys, it's for a goddess." Are you sure I didn't wake you? What were you doing? About me? And what were you thinking? Good night, little monster. Let's speak tomorrow morning. I'll wake you. I forgot to book my wake-up call. Lucky, I suddenly remembered. Who were you calling? I told you. The phone company, to wake me up. Want some? Let's go back to bed. Who were you calling? What is it? Come on. - What now? - Let's come back some other time, Adele. Or you go on your own. I am not used to looking ridiculous. I've booked it now. - To have him followed, like a thief- - But that's what he is. Didn't he steal your youth, your peace, your trust? He's the worst kind of thief. But someone spying on me and Giorgio - seeing everything, hearing everything - will feel like a threesome. Isn't it a threesome already, you poor thing? You must have faith. Trust them as you would your confessor. They take care of all the rest. Good morning. Come in. I apologize for my unpredictable disguise, but transformations are vital in my line of work. I'm here to help my fellow man when he's in need of information, but are you sure you won't regret it? There's still time. Stop and reconsider. In cases such as yours, I always recommend a little trip with your spouse, a second honeymoon. Think about the tender memories in your old age. Two white heads on the same pillow. Time wears out suspicion, and tomorrow you might be laughing at your fears of today. I don't believe in laughing about one's pain. In any case, my sister must know the truth. You're right. I'm at your full service. What does this gentleman do? He gets people together, he organizes parties, I don't know. What is your husband's job? I never understood it. - A public relations man? - That's it. He organizes receptions and openings for the fashion industry. So he's a bright man who always knows what to say and how to answer. His job requires natural sympathy - I'd even call it seduction - to be applied in the professional sphere. And does he come home late at night? What is his schedule like? - He's never home. That's not true. He comes home every evening. He comes home quite late. He's very busy during the day. Do you have a photo? For our psychologist. Valli. Now I must ask a delicate question. - Go ahead. Rest assured that what is discussed here stays within the walls of this office. So, for example, when you look at him - Could you take off your glasses, please? - My glasses? - Yes. Thanks. Does he blush when you look into his eyes? Does he make up excuses whenever you ask him a question? I don't think so. Well... Did you ever catch him speaking a foreign language on the phone? I wouldn't say I caught him. He speaks foreign languages with clients. Do you use pet names when you're intimate? - I don't see - - Pardon. Valli, come in here. I need to have a word with you. - I don't see the relevance - - Hello. Every little thing matters, dear lady. Even the smallest of details. We can't ignore anything. Valli. One of my esteemed associates. Could you give him our subject's photo? Do I really have to leave these photos? Imperative. See? Thank you. Pardon my deplorable indiscretion, signora, but my questions aren't over yet. How you ever found lipstick-smeared hankies? Perhaps a suspicious scent of a woman's perfume? A scent of beauty cream, someone else's hair on his coat or, and forgive me, little scratches on his body? No, never. Let's hear from our psychologist. Looking at the photograph, I'd say he's between 38 and 45 years old, difficult personality, apparently docile. Cold rages, a ladies' man. Be careful, because he's capable of rash gestures. Hidden fear. A great need for his mother. And who doesn't need his mother? Very well, dear lady. From now on, we will devote all our time to your case. Am I right, Valli? - Of course. In a week, you'll know everything your husband does in the daytime. Our zoom lens makes ideas like intimacy and secrecy obsolete. No doors or walls can keep us out. We'll show you your husband as you've never known him. You'll share his most secret hours. You'll penetrate that shadowy zone you were never allowed into. Not even the most sacred of vows could give you the certainty we offer. You'll know everything about your husband. We'll spy on his every breath. But I have a last question for you, my dear signora. Are you really determined to know? Woe unto those who shall tolerate sin, for it makes them accomplices. They shall burn with the sinner in eternal fire. Take vengeance in the name of God. I am the Lord of Justice. Yes. I do want to know. I have a full right to know. I no longer know who he is, what is mine, what I am to him. I need to know what he thinks and does. I want to know everything, everything about him. Have I gotten too fat? No? If you get any fatter, you'll break the platform. Do you like Nadir, Juliet? After all that trouble in finding him, and my archangel was right under my nose. He's the doorman's son. There might be some chocolate in the fridge. Have some. You hadn't seen these new works, right? Looking at my statues isn't enough. You must touch them. Try. When I touch them, I shiver. They feel alive. Michelangelo shouted at his Moses, "Why won't you speak?" I'd like to shout at these powerful forms, "Why won't you love me?" I really would, you know. My art is deeply spiritual. You don't think so, eh? Let's give back to God his physicality. I was afraid of God before. He crushed me, terrified me. And why? Because I imagined him theoretically, abstractly. But no. God has the most superb body ever. In my statues, that's how I sculpt him. A physical, corporeal God, a perfectly shaped hero who I can desire and make my lover. When I was a child, I imagined God was hiding behind a big door. It was always closed... very dusty... in the nuns' little theater. That year, they were putting on the life of a martyr and they picked me. Juliet, you have such innocent eyes. You look like the saint herself. - Did the saint see God? - Yes. When she flew up to heaven, consumed by the flames of martyrdom. Juliet, swear you'll tell me? - Yes. - Ask him if he loves me. - Yes. - Really? Yes, Laura, I'll ask him. Juliet, come. You're on. Arrest her. Bring her before me. Your faith is against the laws of the empire, but we are merciful and willing to forgive. Do you renounce your faith? Will you sacrifice to the emperor? No, never. So you prefer death. Do you accept martyrdom? Yes, I do. You've still got time, if you hold your salvation dear. I don't care about the salvation you offer me, but about the salvation of my soul. Execute the emperor's orders. Burn this Christian at the stake. Stop! Shame on you! This is indecent! I want my granddaughter now. Juliet, come down here. Do as Grandad tells you. Get down now! Professor De Filippis. Enough, in the name of the Lord. Snap out of it. Enough of this shameful behavior. You snap out of it. I'm perfectly sane. Putting a child on the stake. What are we? Cannibals? Bring that thing down here right now! You wretches. Kids, go home. And you get out of my way. This is crazy. You go up and get roasted, if you dare show your legs. What do you teach these creatures? You'll make madwomen out of these innocents. Go grill each other. - Professor De Filippis. Come down from there right now. That's an order. I'm your headmaster. You must obey me. Your behavior is abominable. Shut up. "Abominable." And you? Don't you have anything to say? You let them do anything. So you enjoy getting fried, you silly thing? Did you see God? Answer me. Did you? Answer. I beg you to forget this shameful situation that dishonors our school. Accept our heartfelt apologies. Teresina. Where did that cat come from? It isn't ours. I don't know. Did you see its evil yellow eyes? - It's from the old villa. - It's beautiful. They have a menagerie. Don't move. I'll catch it. Oh, it went inside. Gasperino, come here. Lend us a hand. Cats and I, we don't get along. Careful, it might scratch you. Can we keep it? Cats are terrible. They scratch and bite. - They aren't dangerous. - Well, let's hope for the best. - I got it. - You're so nice and chubby. Cutie. "Suzy." Your name is Suzy. The gate's open. Some place you have here. Excuse me, signora. A hundred years of health and prosperity. And may God make you each day more beautiful for his glory. Tell us the convent story again. - No. - Come here a moment. - Am I good? - Good? You're an angel. See you tomorrow. Mother, can you take Alyosha? I need to talk. Hello? Yes, you're naughty. - No, Professor. You see? He comes here three or four times a day. A very nice boy, but what a mistake falling for my daughter. And my daughter, well, she's - Alyosha, go look at yourself in the mirror. This young man's beauty is on the inside. You can't see it from outside. But women are seduced by outer splendor. And you... you don't have any visible charm. Nice cat. Just a second. You're so kind. Where did you find that vagrant? He was in my garden. I thought I'd bring him back to you. How kind of you. He's so beautiful. He could be stolen if you don't watch out. Hear that, silly? You, shut up. lldegarda. Take him away. Where were you? Did you thank Signora... - Juliet. - What a beautiful name. I'm Suzy. Did he cause any trouble? No, poor thing. He's so good. Good? He's a drunkard. He loves champagne. Oh, the guy on the phone. Are you there? A lady from the villa next door brought the cat back. Sure, all my friends are beautiful. Perhaps... - He's so overbearing. Sorry. - Don't mind me. Stay for a while. It was time we met. Thank you, but I don't want to be in your way. - No. Let's have a drink. Some champagne? - Thank you. Nothing for you. Why don't you stay for lunch? - Thank you, but I can't. We'll get rid of everybody and I'll cook. What do you like eating? Ah, I can't open this. I like you all sweaty like that. Don't worry. I don't want a thing from you. Tomorrow you must - - I'll tell Suzy what you've done. It's a secret of her tribe. Signora, here are the glasses. Here's the champagne for Mrs. Juliet. Great. Paolo, come here. Just a little for you, right? You get really crazy when you drink. Forgive this mess. I've been wanting to change my house around because I'd like more color. Would you like a tour? - Sure. - Come on. How lucky. I bet you can give me a few good tips. Welcome, Juliet. I had a dream about you, you know? You were in some sort of a church. You sat at a teacher's desk, like the ones they have in schools. I sat in the last row, dressed like a nun. You said, "Let me see how you walk." I walked like this, and you flunked me. I woke up crying- We're throwing a party this Saturday. Can I invite you? Bring your husband, of course. I often see you from my windows. You two must be truly in love. I'd like to love one man that way. But how? This is my granny. Can you believe she hasn't slept in five years? She sits here and sees all, knows all. Granny, this is my friend Juliet. Do you like her? What's wrong, my dear? I get spooked when she says such things. She's a bit of a witch too. She sees people and knows their secrets. - Everything passes, you know? - Goodbye, signora. - Hello, beautiful. - How is she? I think she's better, but I heard wailing all night long. Excuse me a moment. Arlette? It's me. Arlette, please. - Welcome. - Juliet, come here. My lady has a very big heart. You haven't touched your food again. Know what I'll do? I'll call Mrs. Artemia now. She'll set you right. Come on. Sit up. Sit up, or I'll tell Roby to leave now. Don't worry, Arlette. She's my friend and she loves you. Right? Of course. Here, have some. Why don't you believe we all love you? I'll come back to see you later. What's wrong with her? What did she do? She tried to take her life three times. The last time, it took a miracle to save her. I called and called. No answer. We had to break down the door. What a sight. She's unlucky in love. I let her live here so we can keep an eye on her. Like Laura, my schoolmate. She drowned herself in a canal at 15. They called it an accident. But she killed herself for love. - Quiet. - Take this one with the feathers. Why are you here? I'm really annoyed now. Excuse me. I told him, "She's going to get angry." Didn't I tell you? You mustn't come in here! Got it? You mustn't! Hands off my stuff! - He only took a slipper, poor thing. This is my home and I'm in charge here. You obey me or go back to the streets. You hear me? She was a whore. - You'd like to be a whore too. Yes, why not? This trollop has some stories to tell. None of it is true, of course. We're just joking around. What else can we do? Juliet, how are you? Iris keeps her word, see? Suzy is your teacher. Listen to her, follow her. I shouldn't encourage your fetishism, Alyosha. Because you are a fetishist. Yes, Momy told me. Keep it. It's a gift. I don't believe fetishism's a good trait. And for a Russian, it must be an appalling one. Ah, come see. I watched you so many times in your garden. Come, Juliet. Look. Do you have mirrors up there too? Do you like them? - Yes. It was my idea. Momy loves them. Sometimes it feels like there are four of us. God, I hope you won't think badly of me. Men have such funny fantasies, you know. Come on in. The water's warm. Another idea of mine. After we make love, we slide down. It's great. Take off your clothes and come on in. - No, thank you. Once Momy dove down headfirst. He nearly kicked the bucket. Come on, Juliet. Dive in. I fulfill my desires in life. I don't deny myself a thing. Look. What's up there? I eat, dance, play, fight. I love fighting. Let's sunbathe. Up there. It's much better than the beach. It's my very own sun. Look. There's the switch on the log. - Are we really going up there? - Sure. Pull the lever down. There's a convent in Greece on a mountain where the monks get up this way. - Send it down again. - Do I lift the lever? Good. Your turn now. - Ready? - Yes. Don't be afraid. If your head starts spinning, close your eyes. - Give me your hand. - No, thank you. I can manage. They can look all they want. They'll never find us. - Sure. - We've lost them. - Who? - Those two guys following us in the car. Didn't you notice? I saw two lovers in those bushes the other day. How they made love. I felt like applauding, they were so good. It looked so delicate, so festive from up here. Is your head still spinning? Let's have a drink. The sun has reached its zenith, the most beautiful hour of the day. There are no shadows at this time. Oh, it's full of rain. There are two fish inside. Sit down. Let's undress and sunbathe naked. No, thanks. I'm just fine. Granny mixes up weird perfumes with wild resins and flowers. I'll let you try some. Men get so drunk on them. Once the engineer... What were you saying about your marriage? - Nothing. Don't you trust me? - Yes, but - - So? Tell me. Haven't you ever thought about getting married? No, never. See, I always thought marriage worked this way - I was all his and he was all mine. I'm ashamed to say it, but Giorgio was my first love. I fell in love as soon as I saw him. All I wanted was to live with him. When he asked me to marry him, I was so happy that I hardly believed it. And he became my whole world - husband, lover, father, friend, my home. I didn't need anything else. I thought it was the way it was meant to be. I was happy. - They may be at the beach. - They've vanished. - No, there they are. Up there. - What are you doing? See? They found us. Naughty boys. We've got something important to tell you. - Do you know them? - Never saw them before. Tell me more about your wedding. It's such a nice story. Did you know I was supposed to get married at 13? Oh, I dropped my shoe. I'm sorry, it's late. I have to get back home. - Are you leaving now? - Yes. Could you let me down, please? You can come up here whenever you like. - Hello. How are you? - Please. There. Won't you stay with us? No, thanks. I'm getting off on the first floor. You stay on. "And among all of these trials was the most terrifying - the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a great palace. Once you've stepped in, you can't leave. The more you wander, the more you lose your way." Here. Teresina, what's with you today? I'm a little sad, signora. So what did the ogre do? Could I leave early today? Auntie. "But the ogre, who was a true daredevil, said, 'I'll go in the labyrinth now."' All right, you may leave, Teresina. "What will you give me if I escape?"' But I don't like you leaving between 3:00 and 8:00 every day. "They walked through the wood of golden apple trees, so plentiful and so resplendent that even at night, the wood was as bright as day." Hello? -ls the lady at home? - Yes, that's me. Who's speaking? A friend. Just a second, please. Go play outside. I'll be with you soon. Go ahead. We'd like to see you. Could you drop in this afternoon? Today? I don't know if today... Have you found something already? We spent seven rather busy days, but I think you'll appreciate our work. - Can't you tell me over the phone? - Honestly, it's not our policy. You understand... - Oi course. - We'll wait for you in our office then. I'll do my best. Goodbye. My respects, signora. Signora, the roses looked better last year. - Hello? - Hello, could you please put my sister on? She's gone out, signora. - When is she getting back? - She didn't tell me. Do you know where I might find her? No. I'll tell her to call you when she gets back. It doesn't matter, thank you. I honestly think we have some outstanding results. Valli? Maybe we can show you what you wanted to know. I can see your worries, my dear signora, but do believe me, nothing is definitive or irreparable. Please sit down. If you only knew how many couples reconciled here, in this office. A little drink? After all, the only way to truly love is to really know each other. St. Augustine's words. You shouldn't consider today as an ominous day. - No, thank you. - You're welcome. The shots may not always be in focus, but you can imagine the conditions my men had to work in. Here are the first three days. From the 23rd to the 25th. I'll read the enclosed report. "On the 23rd, subject left at 7:30, wearing white suit. A car follows him from home to a florist's." Needless to say, we have all the data on the recipient of this floral homage at your disposal. Here she is going into a restaurant. Alas, the hat makes positive identification impossible. See, signora. I suggest that our clients consider what we show them with a little detachment. See, our point of view is objective. Therefore, it's limited. Perception and reality are two different things. Sometimes reality is more innocent than it seems. The method of these meetings was always the same. The man parked his car and entered the young lady's vehicle. The white car is hers. Signora, let me speak to you on the basis of my expertise. I understand a spouse's forgetfulness and euphoria can be irritating, offensive. But are we sure that nausea and remorse aren't already at work beneath this infatuation? Is that Lake Bracciano, Remo? No, a field below the castles. "On the 24th, an afternoon trip to the 27th kilometer on the Via Appia. Stopped in the fields, from 4:20 p.m. to about 6:00 p.m." The girl's name is Gabriella Olsi. 24 years old, a professional model. Let's look at the slides while I change reels. Grillo? I shot these personally. The tape recorder, Remo. We also taped a conversation between them in a car in the park. My God. That wasn't me. When we met, you had another... When I met you, when I met you There was the moon You should be flattered by my words. I'm stupidly revealing my jealousy. It bothers me. - What would you change in me? - You're perfect. The interpretation is up to you. What can we add? As per contractual terms, we remain the exclusive holders of this material, to be exhibited only in the event of legal action. And only if subpoenaed. 100,000 lire for our expenses, equipment, per diems, overtime, etc. Here's your invoice, signora. And believe me, we've treated you with special regard. Thank you. Good day. Our respects, dear lady, and allow us to express our wish that it all turns out happily and in line with your hopes. Have a good time, signora. Here's your charming neighbor. I knew you'd come. How are you? - Good. - Did you send your husband to bed? Listen, Suzy. When are you going to start - He wasn't back yet. My husband is always late. He works. He works a lot. So I came by myself. He trusts me completely anyway. And he's completely wrong. You've met my mother. Best not to wake her, or she'll start singing. Masku has Muhammad guiding his hand. Momy, this is Juliet. Thank you for honoring my house. Do you know who that is? That's Momy, my fiance. He's 65 years old. And he wants to make love every day. And he does. What's up? You look so sad. Sad? Me? Not at all. I'm fine. Actually, I feel like having fun. Good. And I feel like hugging everybody. Here. I want you to be happy. I am the soul renewed and nurtured. Your attention, please. This is the most intimate and secret moment. Now Tudefonde has captured the winds, and each girl is the handmaiden of purification. An ancient Egyptian rite of passage between life and death. I am the goddess of vice. An hour with me might kill you, but you'll reach the heights and depths of pleasure. This is my hour. At 11:00 p.m., I reach the peak of my desire. We play this game in Lola's honor. We simulate the atmosphere of a brothel. How amusing. Then you stare into a man's eyes. There, this one with the big nose. Can't such a gentleman decide? - Is this fine? - Great, perfect. - I offer a week in Japan. - Shame on you. - Fine, two weeks. - You're so stingy. - It's Japan. - It's not enough. Don't listen. - On your knees. What's your name? -lldegarda. No, your name is Sex. What's your name? - Sex. No, your name's Womb. What's your name? - Womb. No, your name is now the name of the goddess. You're not yourself anymore. You're the door, the soil, the corolla, the bed of divinity. You're very pretty. Are you a model? Would you know a Gabriella? - Who? - Gabriella Olsi. - Sure, I know her. - I hear she's a beauty. - Yes. - Much more beautiful than me? She's very beautiful. She's also quite a slut, right? You can tell me, you know. It's becoming sort of a compliment. Do I play my part well? Lola, don't you think she's perfect? He's my godchild. Nice, huh? Juliet, I'm up here. Come up. Go away. What is it? He's waiting. He wants you. The champagne. Suzy is your teacher. Listen to her, follow her. I must have drunk too much. Juliet, what are you doing? I'm late, right? - How are you? - Have you seen Juliet? No, I haven't. Where are you going? To your confirmation? What are you doing? - They're analyzing my wife. - Oh, is the American doctor here? Try to stay focused. Stay in there and try to remember everything. I want to see what happens when your turn comes. - This is very dangerous. - I know you're afraid. No, Giorgio, please. In every psychodrama, each one of us must contribute to the truth. We must create an atmosphere of total, absolute truth around ourselves. Look, I don't think I'm the right person. Try to reenact that scene. You're reproaching your brother-in-law. Would you like to play this lady's brother-in-law? - The counselor is a little too old. - I'm flattered. Fine, let's try this young good-looking man. It'll certainly work out better. I'm sorry. I was reading his palm. You're so rude. I don't understand. I want to tell you something. Come here. I'm not interested in the future. I care about what can happen today, right now. Forgive me. I won't do it again. Signora, they're waiting for you. Yes, I'm coming. Enough. Leave me alone. Barefaced liar. I'll never again believe a word you say. Leave. Out. - Teresina, who are you talking to? - Nobody, signora. - Who were you talking to? - Nobody. - Who's there? - Come on. Everybody's waiting. Doctor, let me play this psychodrama. There's a dark spot in my life that has left me... Good morning, everyone. ...perennially sad. I can't feel happy. It's true, you know. - Sit down. - Hello, Mother. - Finally. - Hello, Adele. - Care for a drink? - No, thanks. Not now. Dr. Miller has proposed a new game - the psychodrama. We reenact our anguishes, projecting them onto somebody else. Interesting. Right? - Yes. But I've seen certain people among your guests. - That's a nice kimono. - Yes? Your eyes are bloodshot. Have you been crying? I find these games utterly boring. Remember not to fly on the 27th. May we pay homage to the lady of the house? So pretty. Of course, with such a beautiful mother... I'll bet you it's a boy. Don't forget I told you. Juliet, listen. This isn't a game. With that sad face, why don't you try it? Yes? Quiet. It's Juliet's turn. Maybe she doesn't want to. You look nervous. - Yes, I do. I'm absolutely fine. - She does, she does. It's an amazing psychological experience. You'll feel set free. It's like seeing yourself in a mirror. Isn't that right, Mrs. Miller? You get straight to your sore spot. - Don't be afraid. Tell us about a painful event in your life. Try to recall here, with us, the place, the people, the circumstances. Can you evoke the atmosphere that characterized that event? Can you really help me? Here they come again. Go away. Go away. - What are you saying? - Nothing. It's just a game. - Let me have this. - Okay. Cut down on cigarettes. Follow your doctor's advice. Can't you see them? Can't you hear them? "Get revenge." "Forgive." Who should I believe? "Make yourself beautiful." "Life is a sacrifice." "Be more feminine. We'll teach you. You're no good." My life is full of people talking, talking. Go away! Get out, all of you! Water. When I want something absolutely pure, something sincere, I always ask for water. Simple things are so important in life. Things that don't conceal something else. Water is like a sincere glance that conceals nothing. Don't be afraid of the truth. The truth sets us free. After all, who cares about other people's reactions? In my country there's a saying - "I am my own roof, window and hearth. Heed upon my words and drink from my thoughts. Therefore, I am happy." Are you real, yes or no? And what advice can you give me? Tell me, what should I do? I wouldn't know. I just want you to live happily. And Giorgio? Where is he? - Do you know what he said? - Quiet. Farewell. Thank you. I'm sorry I forgot, signora. Your husband left early. He didn't want to bother you because you were dancing. He asked to be excused. Somebody was coming in from Brazil. He said he might not be in for dinner. He said he'd call you though. Juliet, listen to my advice. In an adultery suit, it's enough now to bring circumstantial proof, and he's done for. I'm not speaking as your lawyer now, but as a friend who cherishes and loves you. Is there hope for me, Juliet? Think about it. It's in your best interest. I'm presuming to understand the source of your inner conflict, and maybe I can help you. You identify with your problems too much. This is your mistake. Tall old trees are the most impressive symbol of this way of life, deeply rooted in the earth, branches stretched out into the sky, opening in all directions. Theirs is a spontaneous growth. This is the great yet simple secret we must learn - to fulfill ourselves spontaneously, avoiding conflict with desires and passions. Can you feel how calm it is here? Sometimes we must speak up. Even if it's a stranger listening. Lie down in the grass. Relax. Don't be afraid. Look at the sun through the branches. All is peaceful and quiet. But you're not. Why? - I don't know. - What are you afraid of? May I answer for you? You're afraid of ending up alone, of being abandoned, of your husband leaving you. But what you really want with all your heart is to be left alone and for your husband to leave. I want Giorgio to leave me? It's the truth. Without Giorgio, you'd start to breathe, to live, to become yourself. You think you're afraid. In truth, your only fear is to be happy. Signorina Gabriella Olsi. She's not in, but she should be back soon. Do come in. I'm sorry, I was tidying up. She called me around noon saying she wouldn't be back for lunch. These days, she's almost always out. Make yourself at home. May I offer you something? No, thank you. Sorry, signora, but I must finish packing. You're a friend of Miss Gabriella, right? Do you think she's really going to leave this time? The poor thing has been waiting so long for this trip with her boyfriend. It was all set. Then he called at the last minute and said, "We're not leaving." I don't mean to be critical. He's a good man. I've never seen anybody so in love with Miss Gabriella. I must say she deserves it too. I shouldn't be saying this, because we're relatives, but they make such a pretty pair. He says he really feels at home here. He handpicked the furniture. See? It's all very tasteful. Hello? Good day! Yes, I'm packing. There's a lady here waiting. I don't know. I don't know her. Shall I put her on? Would you like to talk to her? It's Miss Gabriella. Yes, I'd love to. Just a second. Look, you can pick up. There's a phone right behind you. - Hello? Who is speaking? - This is Giorgio's wife. Nice to meet you, signora. Did we have an appointment? No, I'd like to talk to you. What can I do for you? Can't you tell me over the phone? I can wait. I'm not in any hurry. I don't think it would be good for you. My afternoon is full and I'll be back late. - Are you afraid? - Afraid? No. Still, I don't enjoy other people's defeats, and I don't think we have anything to say to each other. Good night, signora. Good luck. I'm not leaving. Signora, I have to leave. And Miss Gabriella won't be in till late. I'm sorry, but... Good evening, signora. I'm cooking for your husband. He's leaving. - Our happiness. . . - Teresina, take the bags to the car. ...has only one name. I'm off to Milan, you know? I'm just having a snack. - I'll make it. - Teresina's already taking care of it. Did you put salt in it? And what's the side dish? A little salad. It's ready, sir. - Is the trunk open? - Yes. I'll load it then. It's the first time you've packed for yourself. Are you sure you didn't forget anything? I don't think so. Will you be away long? I don't know. A couple of days maybe. I'll call you. Should I shut the windows? May I go out for a while, signora? Listen, I may be away a bit longer. I haven't been feeling well. Actually, I saw a doctor today. I didn't tell you, but... Would you like some fruit? Thank you. Yes. Perhaps the job has been wearing me out lately. The doctor says I'm fine... but that I should take a break. And, frankly, I need a little time by myself. Finally, we enjoy the pleasure of meeting you. We heard a lot about you from Juliet, but you're much better than we imagined. Mother, Juliet's fiance is here. How are you? Juliet, I think someone's been spreading some malicious gossip. It's true, there's been a friendship between me and that person, a profound friendship, if you will, but nothing more. I assure you, nothing's happened that's final or irreparable. Truth be told - I don't know. Right now, I feel uncertain and confused. I need some time alone. Goodbye then. - I'll call you. - Fine, sure. I'll call you as soon as I get there. Fine. I don't know when. Maybe tomorrow. Remember to set my mail aside. Sure. Your mail. Juliet, do you remember me? Laura. Do as I did. Here everything is gray, still, silent. Come with me, Juliet. Just a long sleep. No more suffering. This isn't true. You don't exist. Go away. Great. You're not real. Go away. Go away! It's Laura, your friend who killed herself for love. Buy a horse, jump hurdles. Go for a nice swim. Is there hope for me, Juliet? Without him, you'll live and breathe, become yourself. She stayed with me all night, but no way... I can't come down. I can't land. It's your fault. It's up to you. A long sleep. No more suffering. No more suffering. Mother, help me. Help me, Mother. I can hear someone crying. It's the wind. - They're calling me. - Don't move. - Obey your mother. - I must go. Don't move. Who are you? Open up. - You mustn't. - Open up. Obey! You don't scare me anymore. Look who's here. My little cutlet. How are you? Where did you leave your grill? Let's wave to those stiffs. See them? Here's my chubby beauty. Now we must leave too. I'd like to come with you. Where to? It's an old plane. It doesn't go anywhere. It only needed to get here. Farewell, Juliet. Don't hold me back. You don't need me anymore. I'm just another one of your inventions. But you are life itself. Ciao, little cutlet. - Who are you? - Friends. - Who are you? - Friends. Real friends. If you want us to, we can stay now. Do you want us to? Do you? Listen. Listen carefully.
