The showdown of the century between human and computer is about to begin. ﻿THE DAY Al SURPASS HUMAN ﻿The human's representative is Asakawa Riku, 7-Dan, 24 years old. ﻿He won "The Rookie of the Year" tournament in his first year as a professional player. ﻿Shogi software has become much stronger. ﻿There is a method of evaluation called "rating." ﻿3300 is the top one... ﻿...and the rating of Shogi software is now about 3300. ﻿I think human will win. ﻿I believe computers cannot beat humans. ﻿This day has finally arrived. ﻿Fujimura-sensei.. ﻿What do you mean with that? ﻿Well, I mean... ﻿If human lose in this.. ﻿We could all lose our jobs tomorrow. ﻿For human, 3300 is... ﻿the very top of the list. It's a very high rating. ﻿If the software's level is close to that point, ﻿it's not at all surprising if it win. ﻿If human lose, he can always win the next time. ﻿The person who challenged 7-Dan Asakawa is ﻿Kiyota Eiichi, 24 years old, the developer of the software that has won the Computer Shogi Championship this year. ﻿What a surprise! The two of them used to be rivals in the Shogi Apprentice School. ﻿when they were little and they both aimed to be professional players. ﻿I'm not particularly conscious about it. ﻿I will play against ﻿the computer software that he created, not himself. ﻿Human Shogi with 400 years of history or the latest computer Shogi, ﻿which one will win? ﻿Today, mankind will witness the end of the game. ﻿Mr. Kiyota has created the most powerful Shogi software. Its name is... ﻿This story is an original story inspired by the Shogi Denousen FINAL 5th Match between 8-Dan Chikara Akutsu vs AWAKE, held on April 11,2015. ﻿SHOGI ASSEMBLY HALL ﻿Apprentice School. ﻿Are you good? ﻿Well... ﻿I'm glad. ﻿Why? ﻿Because it's more fun to play against a strong opponent. ﻿It's this way. ﻿You're used to it. ﻿I had a training session. ﻿I see... ﻿I'm Asakawa... Asakawa Riku. ﻿Kiyota Eiichi. ﻿Nice to meet you. ﻿Today, you are standing on the starting line of becoming professional Shogi players. ﻿We now have 160 members in our apprentice school. ﻿It's a tough world where only 4 people a year can become professionals, ﻿even if you compete for the top 3-Dan league. ﻿So, I hope that you will improve each other's skills ﻿and become skillful players, ﻿not only as Shogi players but also ﻿as bearers of traditional Japanese culture. ﻿Let's begin the game. ﻿Please begin. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿ORYO CRAB HOUSE presents ﻿I'm back. ﻿Welcome back. ﻿You're late. ﻿Did you have a good time? ﻿Oh, 4-2 Dragon. ﻿What? ﻿Did you have a good time today? ﻿The others aren't as strong as I thought. ﻿Do you think you can make friends? ﻿I don't go there to make friends. ﻿I see. ﻿Yeah, that's right. ﻿How about 3-3 Pawn? ﻿If we take the Knight and go for 3-4 Pawn, 2-5 Knight will hit the Silver General. ﻿2-3 Pawn. ﻿6-4 Pawn, 2-4 Rook, 9-7 Promoted Pawn, take the Lance. ﻿But then, I'll be attacked by 8-6 Pawn. ﻿4-6 Pawn. ﻿If the 2nd player defends the Knight with a 6-4 Pawn, you can attack with a 4-5 Pawn. ﻿Take the Pawn, 4-4 Pawn. Take the Silver, and then crossed Silver by 2-4 Rook. ﻿After 4-4 Pawn, how about 3-4 Silver, 2-4 Rook, and 2-3 Silver? ﻿That's 2-8 Rook. ﻿After 2-4 Pawn, you can break the 2nd player's line after you throw away 2-2 Pawn. ﻿Let's get to the next move. Please let me join. ﻿Isn't it 2-2 Pawn? ﻿4-6 Pawn, then 3-6 Pawn. ﻿Aiming Silver with 6-9 Bishop is difficult, afterall. ﻿If you combine it with 4-7 Bishop, you'll be fine. ﻿Really? ﻿I don't like the idea of being attacked on the edge by 7-8 Promoted Bishop, taking the King and 9-7 Promoted Pawn. ﻿Definitely 4-6 Pawn. ﻿Here we go. ﻿Asakawa got it right. ﻿Yay. ﻿What's with him? ﻿Let's do the next one. I go for 3-3 Knight! ﻿I lost. ﻿Thank you very much. You knew you were stuck, didn't you? ﻿Why didn't you resign? ﻿I didn't want to lose. ﻿Yeah. ﻿No one want to lose. ﻿But as soon as you see a dead end.. ﻿as long as your opponent doesn't make a mistake, you can't win. ﻿It's important to respect your opponent. ﻿You have to win the game with your own strength. ﻿You're not a professional player yet. ﻿But you're a Shogi player. ﻿KANTO APPRENTICE SCHOOL LEVEL 5 ﻿ASAKAWA ﻿Please begin. ﻿Thank you. How many moves are we on? ﻿200 moves. ﻿Seriously. ﻿I lost. ﻿ASAKAWA ﻿Let's stop by at a convenience store. ﻿Okay. I want a meat bun. ﻿I want to eat the seasonal fried chicken too. ﻿Fried chicken? ﻿Yeah, fried chicken. ﻿I lost. ﻿I lost. ﻿KANTO APPRENTICE SCHOOL 1-DAN ﻿ASAKAWA ﻿Should we go for a second one? I Sounds good! Where to? ﻿How about karaoke? Karaoke! ﻿Nice. Nice. / All the way to morning. ﻿What's this? / It's Shogi. ﻿Shogi? ﻿I see! ﻿You're getting stronger, Eiichi. ﻿I lost. ﻿He's a genius. ﻿Please begin. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿6-8 King? ﻿Fujimura-sensei. ﻿I've never seen a move like this. ﻿What is he thinking? ﻿When he's overwhelmed, he often make moves like that. ﻿They say, "There are no rules to being a master." ﻿Experience and ability are the key to success. ﻿Well, I guess it can't be helped. ﻿It's the first step of falling. What's his name again. Ah, Asakawa. ﻿I heard he's a strong player. ﻿Yeah. ﻿But he's the one who made Asakawa strong. ﻿It's Kiyota. ﻿The only person in their age group to beat Asakawa... ﻿Kiyota is the only one. ﻿I see... ﻿Everyone in their hometown is calling them a genius, and then they come here. ﻿As they grow up, they realize that there are people above them. ﻿There's no guarantee that their hard work will pay off. ﻿But those who continue to work hard are the real talents. ﻿Yes... ﻿In that sense... They're all very talented. ﻿If possible, I want everyone to be rewarded. ﻿That won't happen. ﻿Well, that's just like you. ﻿But this time... Kiyota's efforts seem to be paying off. ﻿He's stuck. ﻿I didn't know that was possible. ﻿I lost. ﻿ASAKAWA ﻿Welcome back. ﻿I quit. ﻿I quit playing Shogi. ﻿Eiichi... ﻿It's time. Please begin. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿50 seconds. One, two, three, four, five. ﻿I lost. ﻿Amazing. ﻿He won the Rookie of the Year Tournament in his first year as a professional player. It's not so common. ﻿It's a great accomplishment. ﻿Many of the past winners ﻿have gone on to hold titles. ﻿4-Dan Asakawa is also expected to do well in the future. ﻿Yes, he is. ﻿Right. ﻿In the first place... When thinking about economic policy... ﻿First of all, we need to think of... ﻿What policy goals should we set. ﻿That's going to be the key question. ﻿Personally... ﻿Yes, yes, yes, yes. ﻿Why don't you go? ﻿Why? ﻿Hey, are you a new student. ﻿Yes. ﻿Is there anyone here? / No... ﻿You... ﻿Would you be interested in golf? ﻿What? Say. Kiyota-kun, you're not our age, are you? ﻿Yes. / So you failed the entrance exam before? ﻿No... It was the first time I took the entrance exam. ﻿Really? How old are you then? ﻿I'm 21 this year. ﻿Are you serious? You're the same age as me. ﻿Then what... Were you trying to get into Tokyo University or something? ﻿No... I haven't taken any exams. So this is the first time for me. ﻿Then why? ﻿Well... ﻿Do you have a secret or something? ﻿So annoying... ﻿I've got a girlfriend. ﻿Seriously. ﻿Tell me. Who, who, who, who? ﻿Is that even possible? ﻿I thought you'd notice. ﻿So you just ran away. ﻿So, it's a Rook. / So strong. ﻿Right? He's strong. ﻿Hey! ﻿Senior. I'll do it. I'll do it. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Apologize. You bumped into that table there. ﻿Me? ﻿Oh, it's okay. We're just having fun. ﻿The 2nd player's Lance is in the wrong position. It's 9-3, not 9-2. ﻿Also, the 1st player's Horse is at 7-3. ﻿Besides... What's that 3-1 Rook you just said? ﻿Take the Rook. It's easier to get closer from 8-6 Pawn. ﻿What's with you? ﻿What are you, a Shogi fanatic? ﻿I told you to apologize. ﻿Okay, okay. You can do whatever you want. ﻿Hey, wait! ﻿That was close. ﻿Why don't you stay with them? ﻿Thank you very much for your help. ﻿Let's go. ﻿You smell alcohol. ﻿Did you come from home? ﻿Of course. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Get some sleep. ﻿First player, 4-1 Silver. ﻿Second player, 4-8 Bishop. ﻿First player, 6-7 King. ﻿Second player, 7-5 Knight. ﻿It's a dead end. ﻿Oh... you're awake. ﻿Is it a game? ﻿I was at the electronics store the other day. I bought a computer and it came with it. ﻿You want to eat? I'll make something. ﻿It's okay. Continue your game. ﻿But... ﻿No need to feel bad about it. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Thank you. ﻿First player, 6-8 King. ﻿Wait... give me that! ﻿This thing makes weird moves. ﻿Strong. ﻿You think so, too? ﻿Yeah, and... ﻿What the hell is this move? ﻿COMPUTER SHOGI ﻿Shocking Computer Shogi! Advanced Artificial Intelligence ﻿Artificial Intelligence Research Team ﻿Compilation is over. ﻿Um... ﻿You want to join the club? ﻿Write your name, department, class year, phone number, and language spoken on that form. ﻿Oh, no! Another error here. ﻿Source source source source source... ﻿I'm guessing it's the module here. ﻿Are you done? ﻿I think I've sent out too many flyers this year. Actually, one person is enough. ﻿Every year around this time, ﻿I'm always asked to recruit new members. ﻿Even if it's a ghost club member, we need to have a minimum number of people. ﻿Otherwise it's going to be difficult to get this room. ﻿It's very important to have a certain number ﻿of people who want to join the club. ﻿Let me see. ﻿So what do you want to do here, Kiyota. ﻿I want to make a Shogi program. ﻿A Shogi program? A Shogi game? ﻿Is it difficult? ﻿There's nothing easy in this world. ﻿And even more so for you, since "Japanese" is the only language you speak. ﻿You can't do it. ﻿The ultimate goal of this club is to create an artificial intelligence to replace humans. ﻿Control theory programs for games with perfect information ﻿does not contribute to the future of mankind in any significant way. ﻿You should go home. ﻿I really need to do this. ﻿Try memorizing these, for starters. ﻿Come back in a week. ﻿Oh, by the way, my name is Isono. Remember that if you're interested. ﻿My first name is Masuo. ﻿Masuo? ﻿I'm kidding. Since Masuo's last name is Fuguda. ﻿You lost again last week? ﻿I had no luck at all. ﻿Lately, I haven't won anything. ﻿But last week's was terrible. ﻿That was unpredictable. ﻿It was a good thing I only bought 300 yen. ﻿It's been a long time since I did horse racing gambling. ﻿If you know something like that... Please tell me. ﻿Well, you're winning at your daily job. That's good. ﻿When a floating-point number is of double type, how many bits are in the exponent part? ﻿What is the term for a pointer that a class has inside? ﻿This pointer. ﻿Next ones. ﻿No, that's where we use the alpha-beta method. ﻿Not the MinMax method? ﻿With the alpha-beta method, which can cut branches, ﻿it can read almost twice as deep as with the MinMax method. ﻿I see. ﻿It's working. ﻿Of course. It's programmed to work that way. ﻿Well, that's progress. Literally, progress. ﻿It's working. ﻿What's its name? ﻿The program's name. ﻿What? Am I supposed to name it? ﻿Of course. You're the one who created it. So decide quickly. ﻿I haven't thought about it. ﻿You're so indecisive. ﻿Well, okay. That's enough for today. ﻿I'll stay a bit more. ﻿Let's have a drink. ﻿Shall we try to make it play against people soon? ﻿It has not reach that level yet. ﻿You can raise its level by then. ﻿How? ﻿We're going to have to load a lot of game records. ﻿Then, we need to build the evaluation value based on the game record. ﻿But our current PC's specification is not enough. ﻿Yeah. ﻿SHOGI CIRCLE ﻿Seriously. ﻿Come in. It's opened. ﻿One game, please! ﻿What? ﻿That's how it's usually done when you ask for a game, right? ﻿You've got to be serious. ﻿I'll pay for the game. ﻿What? Are you sure? ﻿Of course. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Thank you. ﻿How long are you going to be depressed? "I have not failed." "I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." ﻿Thomas Edison. ﻿It's frustrating. ﻿Wasn't it a practice match? ﻿A loss is a loss. ﻿Isono. ﻿Yeah? ﻿I want to make this program stronger. ﻿When I saw computer Shogi for the first time, ﻿I thought, "What a creative way to play the game." ﻿Free moves, not bound by a set of rules. ﻿And yet strong. ﻿It's my ideal Shogi. ﻿First player, 4-1 Silver. ﻿That time... ﻿I see things differently when I heard the computer's voice. ﻿Maybe it was the computer who woke me up. ﻿AWAKE. What do you think? The name of the program. "AWAKE." "I'm awake." "I wake up from sleep." "It brings back memories." "Awaken"... ﻿Is it lame? ﻿If the name has a symbolic meaning for identification, ﻿that's enough. ﻿But... ﻿I think that's a good name. ﻿To begin with, variable costs are costs that depend on the amount of production, ﻿specifically, the cost of raw materials... ﻿What the hell? I'm in class. ﻿The source code of Bonanza has been released! ﻿Bonanza? ﻿The best Shogi software in the market. Look at this! ﻿Why is this stuff free? ﻿Because it's the programmer's work. ﻿A programmer's value increases only when many people see it. ﻿By making it public, someone else can improve it and make it better. ﻿The great thing about this software is ﻿full-width search and machine learning of the phase evaluation function that makes this possible. ﻿If we can improve the AWAKE program based on this, ﻿it will be overwhelmingly stronger. ﻿Stronger... ﻿When it's finished, let's aim to be the champion of the Computer Shogi Championship! ﻿THE CHAMPION!? / You idiot. ﻿You're too loud. ﻿Then... what should we do now. ﻿There's only one thing to do. ﻿We've got a lot of writing to do. ﻿It's starting. / Here we go. ﻿Who the hell is it? ﻿It's time. ﻿5-Dan Asakawa moves first, please. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Is it really getting stronger? ﻿Of course. ﻿We're busy today, aren't we? Here we go again with this incomprehensible move. ﻿I see. ﻿Well... ﻿What does this mean? ﻿Normally... it usually go like this. ﻿But, well, it's a declaration that he does it his own way. ﻿It is 5-Dan Asakawa's free style. ﻿It's a game, so of course he aim to win. ﻿But, at the same time, 5-Dan Asakawa's moves says something like... ﻿I feel that he has a strong will to push forward ﻿without fearing the depth of Shogi. ﻿It's too free. ﻿Is this possible? ﻿I've never seen a move like this. ﻿I see. ﻿Oh, this is... ﻿5-Dan Asakawa is getting close to winning, I guess... ﻿Is it bad? ﻿I should move this... ﻿What? Oh... ﻿50 seconds. One, two, three, four, five... ﻿...six, seven, eight... ﻿I lost. ﻿Oh, he gave up. 5-Dan Asakawa lost his first title. ﻿Well done, Ito, the Master of Shogi. ﻿He read his move and tricked him to do the opposite and attacked at once. ﻿As expected of a veteran player. ﻿5-Dan Asakawa.. ﻿They didn't let you win like they did in the Rookie of the Year tournament. ﻿I lost. ﻿Yes! ﻿So strong. ﻿It might be 4 or 5-Dan. ﻿Are we done. ﻿Oh... thank you. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Can I have more time? ﻿You think you're a professional Shogi player? You've won, but you're looking so gloomy. ﻿There's no time to be happy about it. ﻿Is that so? ﻿There's a few things even I couldn't read. ﻿I didn't think it was that strong. ﻿We need to increase the number of self-learning sessions and improve the accuracy of the evaluation values. ﻿Where is it? ﻿This one. ﻿The champion of the 2nd Computer Shogi Championship! ﻿The software that won is AWAKE. ﻿The developer is Kiyota Eiichi. ﻿So what are you going to use the prize money for? ﻿I'll use it for programming. ﻿So tough being a student. ﻿Okay. ﻿You're overreacting. ﻿I'm so glad. ﻿Ah, yes. ﻿I couldn't throw it away, so I kept it. ﻿It's okay to return it now, right. ﻿Denousen? ﻿A match to see which one is stronger, a professional Shogi player ﻿or a computer software? ﻿We'll broadcast it live on our site. ﻿We'd like AWAKE to participate in it. ﻿Professional player and... ﻿This is good news. ﻿Good news. We can foretell the future of the battle between artificial intelligence and human too, from this match. ﻿I'm sure it will be one of the most discussed matches in the future. ﻿Who's the opponent? ﻿The Shogi Association has selected a player for us. ﻿Oh, do you know him? ﻿A young promising strong player. 7-Dan Asakawa Riku. ﻿For the time being, I'd like to ask you to improve the program before the match. ﻿We'd like to have you submit it two months before the game, ﻿for your opponent to study it. ﻿Kiyota! ﻿You don't remember? ﻿The Tosai Shimbun Culture Dept. - Shogi Reporter NAKAJIMA TORU ﻿After I quit the Apprentice School, I helped the Association distribute game records. ﻿Then, I was approached by someone. ﻿I'm in charge of Shogi news coverage now. ﻿Wow, that's great. ﻿That's my line. ﻿I can't believe you're the developer of AWAKE. ﻿I watched the ﻿Computer Shogi Championship. ﻿I got a little excited. ﻿I mean, it made me happy. ﻿Why would you? ﻿All you had was Shogi, ﻿but then you had to quit. ﻿You couldn't bring yourself to do anything. ﻿You didn't know what to do. ﻿Well, that was how I felt too. ﻿I guess I relate to you too much. ﻿I was just so into it. ﻿I wanted to make AWAKE stronger. ﻿Yeah. ﻿AWAKE is strong. ﻿Maybe... ﻿...it will change the history of professional Shogi. ﻿Actually, I heard that the Association had a hard time choosing the right player. ﻿Why? ﻿They are scared to play against computer. ﻿If they lose, ﻿the prestige of the professional Shogi world could be damaged. ﻿Well... ﻿Then he took the challenge. ﻿That's just very much like him. ﻿Does he know his opponent is really me? ﻿I don't know... ﻿But as a professional player, it's a very risky match. ﻿I don't think he would take this challenge, ﻿if he doesn't have a pretty good reason for it. ﻿And besides.. ﻿...to play against a strong opponent, ﻿is the instinct of a professional player. ﻿Asakawa. ﻿Computer Shogi Championship The Best Al Shogi Professional Shogi Players are no longer needed!? ﻿I read it. Are you really going to do it? ﻿Recent software is strong, y'know. ﻿You can download it online. You better try it once. ﻿I understand. ﻿This article tries to stir trouble, but it does not say anything wrong. ﻿' Human vs Computer showdown"... They exaggerated it. ﻿There is no need for you alone to stand on the brink of the Shogi world ﻿and cross a dangerous bridge. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿I've made up my mind. ﻿Okay. ﻿Good. ﻿Okay. ﻿Here... ﻿It's done. Wow, that's amazing! ﻿You're really bad at this. ﻿You're even still using a flip phone. ﻿It's still convenient. ﻿There are many new types now. ﻿Shinichiro wants you to teach him hogi. ﻿He wanted to come again today, but he has a baseball game. ﻿Shinichiro? ﻿Seriously? You forgot your own nephew's name? ﻿No, I'm just kidding. ﻿It doesn't sound like a joke coming from you. ﻿Anyway, Shinichiro is very proud of his uncle. ﻿So, you better win the match. ﻿Uncle, huh. ﻿So, how strong is that software, really? ﻿Riku? Is it really this strong. ﻿Welcome. We've been waiting for you. ﻿Come in. ﻿Oh, sorry to bother you. ﻿He's there. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You finally came. ﻿The evil secret base. ﻿Look. ﻿It's what I told you the other day. ﻿It's a 10-nanometer manufacturing process CPU. We were trying to introduce this at my company. But for political reasons, it was dropped. ﻿But the stuff is great. ﻿You can use this to improve AWAKE's machine learning efficiency. ﻿This is not the same as the last winning version. It's not even close. ﻿I'll make some tea. Kiyota-san, is coffee okay? ﻿Please don't mind me. ﻿Oh, sorry. ﻿What's going on? ﻿This thing can handle SIMD command perfectly. ﻿Then there's a method called Lazy SMP that came out recently. ﻿That's not it, that girl... ﻿Didn't I tell you? She's been living with me since last month. ﻿You're kidding, right? I didn't know you were interested in girls. ﻿I'm not interested. They're so irrational. ﻿But you two are living together! ﻿Hey. ﻿That's too mean. Don't say it like I'm an object. ﻿I don't think Kiyota-san will misunderstand if you explain properly. ﻿Isn't that what's called irrational, ﻿big brother. ﻿Oh... ﻿You've got a point. ﻿Depending on the result of this match, ﻿it is feared that the fans will lose interest in human Shogi players. ﻿In order for that not to happen... ﻿I have to give it my all. ﻿They say AWAKE's ability is on par with professionals. ﻿I've heard that it's even better than professionals. How confident are you? ﻿No, I can't say I'm confident yet. ﻿Um... it's tougher than I imagined. ﻿But I want to challenge myself as much as I can. ﻿The developer of your opponent's program ﻿was your rival in the Apprentice School. Any comment about this. ﻿I'm not particularly conscious about it. ﻿I will play against the computer software that he created, not himself. ﻿Human will definitely win. ﻿But... ﻿The computer has higher rating. ﻿It doesn't matter. ﻿Human intuition is definitely better than machine calculation. ﻿What if our intuition gets the better of us? ﻿No, no, no. You have to carefully think about it if you're a professional player. ﻿Because they've been doing this all their lives until they became professional players. ﻿They would never make a mistake like that. ﻿Would you like to resign? ﻿Asakawa. Are you okay. You're a little overwhelmed, aren't you. ﻿No, I'm fine. ﻿It's not a burden you can carry alone. ﻿Don't push yourself too hard. ﻿No. ﻿I will do it. Is it because your opponent is Kiyota. ﻿If there comes a time when I don't go into a game thinking I want to win, ﻿I think I will have to quit being a professional player. ﻿The following is the link. Please check. Thank you. Best Regards, Kiyota Eiichi. ﻿For the first time in history! One million yen if you can beat AWAKE, ﻿the most powerful software used in the showdown of the century with human! ﻿AWAKE takes 5 seconds to make a move, ﻿while humans have a 10-minute handicap. ﻿Everyone, please try to get 1 million yen! Good luck! ﻿It has just passed 100 wins in a row. ﻿Looks like we're going to end this afternoon without a winner. ﻿Ah, over here. ﻿Wow, so Shogi tournament is like this. ﻿No, this one is specially made like this. ﻿You came. ﻿Would you like to resign? ﻿SECOND PLAYER LOST ﻿Yes! ﻿Finally, we have a winner! ﻿After over 100 matches... Finally! ﻿This is it. ﻿7-6 Pawn, 3-4 Pawn, 6-8 Rook, 8-4 Pawn. ﻿4-8 King, 6-2 Silver, 1-6 Pawn. ﻿2-6 Pawn, 5-4 Pawn, 2-7 Silver, 2-8 Bishop. ﻿2-8 Bishop? ﻿2-8 Bishop? ﻿This bishop? What's wrong with this? ﻿Something's wrong. This move will lead to dead end. ﻿1-6 Lance, 1-9 Promoted Bishop, 3-8 King, 5-2 Gold, 5-8 Gold, 1-2 Lance, 4-8 Gold. ﻿Damn it... ﻿This is a trap move! ﻿Human will never make a move like this! ﻿It's hitting the weak point of the full-width search. ﻿Human can change their moves depending on the situation, ﻿but that's not the case with AWAKE. ﻿99% of the time, when it is led into this phase, it will move this way. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Humans would never move bishop at this point. ﻿Because we know from experience that it's a bad move. ﻿So... There's no way it can lead to that. ﻿Oh, geez... ﻿I have to fix the program. ﻿But you've already submitted the program. ﻿I just need to make sure he doesn't go with 2-8 Bishop in this designated phase. ﻿Hori-san! ﻿Kiyota-san. Can you wait a moment? ﻿Please let me resubmit the program. ﻿I've just seen the game record. ﻿The current AWAKE evaluates the 2-8 Bishop trap move as valid. ﻿The only way to stop it from happening is to rewrite it. ﻿But the rule says ﻿once submitted, it cannot be resubmitted. ﻿This is almost like a bug! ﻿But the exact same thing won't happen again... ﻿I'm sure there's another way. ﻿I won't change anything else. ﻿I just need to make it correspond to this phase... Please. ﻿But... ﻿If I make this correction, we can have a fair fight! ﻿If we let this move as it is... ﻿AWAKE will terribly lose!! ﻿Kiyota! ﻿Let go of me! I'm having an important conversation. ﻿Please go. ﻿Stop. ﻿Hurry! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Don't you care if AWAKE lose? ﻿Just calm down. It's the rules. ﻿The rules are wrong! ﻿That move only comes out in that phase. ﻿Right? ﻿Yeah. ﻿How likely is it that your opponent would know that? ﻿He can always study it. So, it's likely. ﻿Is that a move a professional player would make? ﻿I don't know about professional players' thoughts. ﻿I thought I had it all figured out. ﻿I'm sure he won't make that move. ﻿He won't. ﻿Do you know him? ﻿He beat me before. ﻿I thought I couldn't compete with him so I stopped trying to be a professional player. ﻿But I've only ever played Shogi. ﻿I didn't know what to do after I quit. ﻿But... ﻿I met computer Shogi. ﻿What can I say? I may be exaggerating. ﻿It's like I have found my goal in life. ﻿It's really fun to see AWAKE is ﻿getting stronger and stronger. ﻿It freely moves without being bound by the rules. ﻿If AWAKE continues to get stronger... ﻿...discovering new moves that even the top professionals can't think of. ﻿I thought that if I could develop such a program, ﻿then my decision to quit Shogi would make sense. ﻿So, actually... ﻿I didn't create AWAKE ﻿to find out who is stronger, human or computer. ﻿But if I miss this chance... ﻿I'll never be able to compete with him again. ﻿I really want to play against him. ﻿If I could just get him to ﻿acknowledge AWAKE's strength. ﻿You're getting stronger. ﻿SHOGI ASSEMBLY HALL ﻿Are you good. ﻿Well... ﻿Good. ﻿What? ﻿Because it's more fun to play against a strong opponent. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen. This day has finally arrived. ﻿That's right. ﻿Fujimura-sensei. ﻿What do you mean with that? ﻿Well, I mean... ﻿If human lose this... ﻿We could all lose our jobs tomorrow. ﻿This match is really a must watch. We have lots of comments, too. ﻿Mr. Kiyota Eiichi, the developer of AWAKE, ﻿just entered the venue. ﻿There are many comments for Mr. Kiyota. ﻿Is he nervous? ﻿I'm nervous too. ﻿Why? ﻿It's the showdown of the century. ﻿Indeed. ﻿It's nerve-wracking. ﻿This time, Denoute-san, developed by ﻿Denso Corporation, will play for the AWAKE side. ﻿Amazing. It's like the future. ﻿It's so cool. ﻿Asakawa-sensei has just entered too. ﻿It's finally time. ﻿I wonder what kind of match they'll show us. ﻿It's starting. ﻿It's time. 7-Dan Asakawa will make the first move. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿It's starting. ﻿So, will the first move be 7-6 Pawn or 2-6 Pawn? ﻿First player, 7-6 Pawn. ﻿Second player, 3-4 Pawn. ﻿3-4 Pawn, huh. ﻿It didn't become a fortress position. ﻿Well, software cannot shape a fortress. ﻿True. ﻿7-Dan Asakawa. What's your next move? ﻿Well, I guess... It's a common start. ﻿After this, the pattern of 2-6 Pawn ﻿or is it 6-6 Pawn to stop the bishop's diagonal move? ﻿Yes. ﻿Hopefully he stop it. ﻿Fujimura-sensei, you like Swinging Rook, don't you? ﻿Well, in any case... ﻿The next move is already a turning point in his strategy. ﻿2-6 Pawn 8-4 Pawn 2-5 Pawn 8-5 Pawn 2-4 Pawn 6-8 Rook 8-4 Pawn 4-8 King 8-5 Pawn 7-8 Gold Next move prediction: ﻿First player, 6-8 Rook. ﻿He swung. ﻿Oh, I see. ﻿That was unexpected. ﻿Fujimura-sensei, it's your favorite Swinging Rook. ﻿Sensei? ﻿Sorry, no... ﻿6-8 Rook at this point in the game might mean... ﻿he is luring it into 2-8 Bishop? ﻿The same thing happened in the pre-event the other day. Exactly this. ﻿The next move is 8-4 Pawn and 4-8 King. ﻿No way. No professional player would do that. ﻿Second player, 8-4 Pawn. ﻿First player, 4-8 King. ﻿If it's the exact same flow, next would be 6-2 Silver. ﻿First player, 1-6 Pawn. ﻿In other words, what we can expect after this is... ﻿At the end, after 2-7 Silver, ﻿the 2nd player will go with 2-8 Bishop. ﻿He's luring it into attacking the bishop. ﻿If it's the same as last time, AWAKE will... ﻿No, even just a little...

What did he say? ﻿I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. ﻿Is he resigning? ﻿What? But... ﻿Oh, they're bowing. ﻿What's wrong? What's going on here? ﻿I thought it could recover from it. ﻿I thought so. ﻿This is a bit shocking. ﻿Yes... ﻿It's a little bit hard to believe. ﻿7-Dan Asakawa. How do you look back on this match? ﻿Are you satisfied with the way you won this time? ﻿Did you know the results of the pre-event? ﻿7-Dan Asakawa, when did you decide to use this strategy? ﻿Mr. Kiyota, do you have anything to say to 7-Dan Asakawa? ﻿Please tell us how you feel now. ﻿Mr. Kiyota, what would you like to say? ﻿Mr. Kiyota.

I meant to do that. ﻿I knew it. ﻿Alright, then. ﻿I think... ﻿they both did great. ﻿Asakawa who was determined to win. And Kiyota who came here again. ﻿Both of them fought with the heart of professional Shogi players. ﻿They played a good match. ﻿I don't care what the world says about them. That is what I think. ﻿But... ﻿One day, I'd like to let them fight in a place with more freedom. ﻿Shogi is supposed to be fun, isn't it? ﻿...said a professional Shogi player who was close to both of them. ﻿You may write my name. ﻿No, I'll go with "a professional Shogi player." ﻿Alright, then. ﻿It's really strong. ﻿Yes. ﻿I see. ﻿For the specification change, well, if that's about it... ﻿I'll have it up by the end of next week. ﻿No, no, not at all. ﻿Okay, then. ﻿Okay, I'll hang up now. ﻿7-Dan Asakawa - King of Shogi Championship - Two Consecutive Wins ﻿Two-piece handicap? ﻿I'm losing.

That's called being taught. ﻿That's not true. ﻿In the "1st Denousen" held in 2016, the Shogi program PONANZA defeated the professional Shogi player, 8-Dan Takayuki Yamazaki. ﻿In 2017, PONANZA defeated Sato Amahiko in the "2nd Denousen."
