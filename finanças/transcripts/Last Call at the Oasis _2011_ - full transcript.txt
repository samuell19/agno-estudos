>> Water is everything. The single most necessary element for any of us to sustain and live and thrive is water. >> I grew up in the Mid-West and I have a father who'd actually worked for industry and he used to sing me songs all the time. Sometimes we'd be at the creeks and he just make up little songs about see that lovely water, you know, trickling down the spring, don't take it for granted, someday it might not be seen. He promised me, in my lifetime that we would see water become more valuable than oil. He said because there will be so little of it. I think that time is here. >> It's the third week in a row without any water. The army has been called in to protect the capital's water pumps. >> There's been a lot of talk about peak oil when the production of oil reaches a peak and then inevitably starts to decline. Like peak oil, there is peak water. We're reaching the limits of what we can use. >> Once the fourth largest freshwater lake in the world, the Aral Sea has been diminished to about one tenth its original size. >> The levels in Brazil's Amazon region reach record lows. >> Spain is the grip of drought. >> The drought ravaging China's southwest is being called the worst -- >> -- the worst in 40 years. >> Worst drought in 70 years. >> -- The worst in the century. >> Every region of the world is facing water problems from China to the Middle East. >> Half the world's hospital beds are occupied by patients with water-borne diseases. >> By 2025, half of the world's population will not have adequate access to water. I mean, it could not be more serious. >> We've seen what happens in other parts of the world and we just always think that never can be me. It already is you. >> Why so serious. So raise your glass if you are wrong, in all the right ways, all my underdogs we will never, never be anything but loud. >> I know it's a surprise to some people that there is a crisis. But the reality is in the United States, we Americans are spoiled. We have the biggest water footprint in the world. >> Raise your glass. Won't you come on and come on, and raise your glass. Just come on and come on and raise your glass. Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass. >> When there's a water problem, the ripple effect is enormous. Downstream, the water finds its way to you and it definitely rocks the boat. >> Oh shit, my glass is empty, that sucks. >> People love water, especially when it's 118 degrees outside in the summer. We sell virtual reality. People come to Las Vegas to escape their reality. And part of that is the cooling sensation of fountains, it looks like prolific waste. What they don't understand is that the entire Las Vegas strip uses 3 percent of this community's water supply and is the single largest contributor this state's economic product. >> We see growth every time it snows in Buffalo and water consumption all of a sudden began skyrocketing. >> The amazing thing about Vegas is that it refuses to let the lack of water constrain its growth. Las Vegas has built housing developments as large as San Francisco. They never worried about water because right next door to Vegas is Hoover Dam and behind Hoover Dam is Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the country. >> Hoover Dam and its power plant serve water and power needs in California, Nevada and Arizona. >> When it was built, Hoover Dam and Lake Mead were going to save the west forever. >> Colorado River waters that once destroyed man and his property now serve him. >> You don't have to be a scientist to understand that if you take more water out of the bathtub than you put in to the bathtub, the bathtub will eventually go empty. The elevation has been dropping 10 feet every year. Today, it's only about 40 percent full. We're measuring 1086. >> Las Vegas will lose our upper intake at elevation 1050. 1050 will be a wakeup call because at 1050, Hoover Dam stops generating electricity. >> You've only got 36 feet to go. That's four years. >> No one ever imagined that that was possible. In my mind, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. >> In our original work, we looked at the situation where the lakes go dry, actually dead pool. By 2025, we could've reached that with the probability about 50 percent and we were shocked. >> When I think of water, I think of it as giant milkshake glass. And I think of each demand for water as a straw in a glass. >> With the amount of water being taken out of the Colorado system is maxed out right now, and yet there's going to be less. >> If we don't do anything, Las Vegas is a dead city, period, full stop. >> They are proposing to build a 3 billion dollar pipeline, 250 miles long to draw water out of one of the last oases in Nevada. >> This is a project out of sheer desperation because there's nothing else available. >> If I get the water line in here, it'll just turn into a dust bowl. >> If you haven't got any water, you're done. If they take that, where do I go? I'm done. And my kids are done. >> This is Goliath Water. He's from Southern Nevada and he wants your water. >> The very people you wouldn't hurt if they were your neighbors, you'll fight to the death over a glass of water. >> This project may succeed over my dead body. >> Can you afford not to build it. Are you willing to put your family at risk? That's what it gets down to. >> This pipeline. It's going to be built, isn't it? >> There is no option. So am I supposed to sit here and say, "The fate of 2 million people doesn't matter to me, they're just going to have to live with whatever Mother Nature decides to dole out." That is about as irresponsible a statement as I've ever heard someone come up with. >> The way the city was developed, the way it was planned, politicians just let people build whatever the heck they wanted. >> If you want to say it should never have happened, well, the cows have left the barn. >> If Las Vegas is going to keep growing, they'll take this water and then they'll still run out of water. >> It's easy to point the finger at Vegas. But when you look at the future of growth in water, we are all Vegas. >> When we get hit, Phoenix gets hit, and Los Angeles gets hit. >> The mighty Rio Grande, now nothing more than a dirt road. >> People in Atlanta are actually praying for rain. >> Lake Superior is said to be disappearing. >> Thirty-six US states face water shortages in the next three years. >> Junior, it's time for you to visit your mother earth. >> Oh pop, let me stay here with you. >> When we think of water, we think of it as the air. Infinite and inexhaustible. >> This is the cycle of water by which all life survives. >> All the water there ever was still is. We are drinking the same water that the dinosaurs drank. So how can it possibly be a problem with the water supply? >> Turn the faucet and there is water at any hour of the day or night. >> The resource is renewable. That's the beauty of the hydrologic cycle. But when you use such quantities that it exceeds the capacity of the system to renew itself, then you have a problem. >> You know, I used to think that it might be impossible to run out of water. There's a lot of water on the earth. But less than 1 percent is freshwater that's available to drink. There are places that could actually run out of water and California is one of them. When I would drive through the Central Valley, I'd see all these signs about water. That's actually how I get interested in studying the valley was by seeing those signs and then trying to understand what was going on. I really had no idea that I was opening such a Pandora's Box. >> For California's valley, a good supply of water all through the year has changed a worthless desert into productive farmland. >> Back in the '30s, the government turned on the tap for the farmers. The Central Valley produces about 25 percent of the food consumed in the United States. We now have about 7 million irrigated acres. We're stretching a limited resource to its limits. It really is a giant can of worms. >> These almonds are being removed because of the lack of water. I had to walk away, yeah. I knew it was coming, but I couldn't take the hardship to watch, yeah. Certainly, it's heartbreaking. When I was out here putting the trees in the ground 23 years ago and now we've had the rug pulled up from under us. >> Some people say, "This is the first instance of people in the United States turning on the tap and not getting water." >> West Valley farmers will not get any federal water this season. >> That decision is a result of less water pumping to protect fish populations in Northern California. >> The Central Valley of California was once considered the bread basket of America. But now, farms all over that region have been allowed to dry up. Now why? Because of a two-inch minnow on the endangered species list. >> Where I come from, we call that bait. >> Somebody has got to turn the water back on -- >> Either that or put us on the endangered species list. You're going to get your vegetables from China and I understand they made great baby milk formula. >> By the way, be sure to check out Sean Hannity's new children's book, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, boo! Boo fish. >> It's been convenient for certain politicians to say, "Look, we're hurting people. Why should we protect this little fish at the expense of people?" But that's wrong. The Delta smelt is a small insignificant little fish. But it's not insignificant if you realize the delta smelt is just a symbol of a much bigger problem. It's a symbol of an ecosystem that's collapsing. >> The water for the Central Valley comes from the Sierras. It ends up in the Bay Delta. >> This is the greatest estuary on the West Coast and we've allowed it to crash. All of the fish, it's not only the salmon, it's not only the Delta smelt, it's going to impact everything. It's going to impact the people. The last two seasons, we didn't have any salmon fishing whatsoever. You know, we still sell fish but we bring it in from someplace else. We could see the absolute demise of salmon here in California. We fishermen have to speak up. We've become politicians and activists. >> No water for the farmers because of this fish. >> Boo! >> Yeah, that fish. >> California in many ways is the epitome of the global water problem. >> We need water! We need water! >> We love water! >> The truth is there's not enough water to do everything everybody wants. >> Farmers use most of the water. That's about 80 percent in most states. In some western states, it's as high as 90 percent. So when we want to talk about the future of water, we have to talk about farm use. >> The people that have taken the water away from us have told us, "Well, your solution is to turn to groundwater." So I ask them, "Is it going to be on your watch that we now dry up all the groundwater source in the San Joaquin Valley?" Hard decisions, aren't they? >> The water that gets deep into the ground stores up as a subterranean treasure. >> Farmers have had their surface water cut way, way back. And so, the logical thing to do then is to pump groundwater. >> All around the United Sates, the water table in the aquifers is going down and it took in many places, thousands of years for this water to accumulate in the aquifers and yet, we're going through it in mere decades. >> For many years, I've been working with a satellite called GRACE. If you are looking at an area that's had a big mass change, say from groundwater depletion, GRACE can see that because the mass change is so big that it's actually sensed by the satellites. We can see a significant depletion in California. We've been keeping a close eye on the Central Valley. If we go back to 1998, the aquifer has lost about one and a half times the volume of Lake Mead. That's a huge amount of water. >> How much is left in the aquifer? >> Let me see how I can sugarcoat this. You know, I ran some back of the envelop numbers looking at how long it would take at those pumping rates for the aquifer to be depleted. And I got a number between say, 60 and 100 years. So at the low end, 60 years, that's frightening. I think California is in trouble. The combination of climate change growth and groundwater depletion spells a train wreck. >> Well, if you had to pick one place in the United States, it's really right in the crosshairs, it's got to be Southern California. What would happen if we suddenly didn't have the water? That's when people will finally say, "Oh my god, we have a water problem. Build new dams, do this, do that." Too late. >> We need to start planning for the future and it's a future in which we're not going to have a huge snow pack in the Sierras or the Rocky Mountains. It's just -- it's not going to be there. >> If you told your parents that by the end of the 21st century, there would be no snow in California, do you think they'd believe you? This is the future. Okay, this is the water -- >> They'll see it happen. They'll experience it. That's a very difficult thing for people to grasp. It's been like watching a Polaroid develop truly. It's like an, "oh my god moment" and you realize, I can't believe this is happening and I need to tell somebody about it. California faces a water crisis of potentially epic proportions. You know, how we respond today will define who we are tomorrow. >> Need additional storage. I mean, they've built reservoirs for a reason. Shasta, Hoover. >> You owe the bank and the county taxes. You're going to try to farm as much as you can. >> They're not going to make more water. The only solution to this thing is conservation. >> I agree. We should look into conservation, but that's not going to yield or have any effect on our groundwater shortage. >> I didn't want to give into this. But your arguments about conservation and efficiency are just wrong. And if you're right, the conservation and efficiency isn't going to get us anything. And if I'm right, there's not a lot of new supply out there. Then what are we left with? Take land out of production, I don't know anyone who wants that. >> Your arguments just don't make any sense. You have to live in the valley, you have to understand the management of water here. >> Well, that's a bad management. And you're one of the managers. I'm sorry. >> What I'm telling you is 1.2 >> That whole system -- >> And they wanted to make clearly the statement that we do face a crisis now of epic proportions. And I said that. And I'm not sure that it really resonated which to me is a little startling. >> Whether we talk about water -- >> We need a plan and we don't have one. And it is complex. We're screwed, yeah. >> Australia is much like California in many ways. It has a very large agricultural community that uses most of the water that humans in Australia use. The one thing that Australia has had that California has not had is nearly a decade of incredibly severe drought. >> We're seeing it as a whole host of bizarre problems that are cropping up. >> Australians in Sydney woke up this morning to find the skies glowing red. >> The inland parts are so dry. It picked up vast quantities of topsoil. >> There is a plague ravaging the Australian outback. Drought is driving the animals into towns. >> Crews in Australia battling the deadliest wildfires in the country's history right now. >> The California of tomorrow was the Australia of today. They're having to dramatically and radically rethink agriculture. >> There was actually nothing that grew. You put the crop in, and you had nothing but dust. I was at a guy's house once, the stock was the worst they've ever seen. In my opinion, some of these cattle might have to be put down. How would you cope with that? He said, he will kill himself. He told me straight out, "I'll kill myself." >> I go to farms in a couple of shires and ask them how they're going. Well over here where are you going today, they haven't hit any water allocation for five years. >> So we'll have to buy in a lot of food because we can't grow it ourselves with no water. So the milk price doesn't cover the cost of production. >> You must have had enormous stress on your families and yourself going through all this with no water and -- >> That's an understatement. >> That would be an understatement. >> Yeah. That's an understatement. >> It's our cows. They're my babies. There is no future here because of the control of the water. They are taking it away from the farmers. >> When you go to two or three houses and you hear the same story about stress, anxiety, debt. >> I would never know what I was coming home to. >> You had a fear of that? >> Yeah, absolutely. Be wondering about it the whole time. >> Yeah. >> I'd better just make sure he was still alive and that sort of thing. >> Yeah. In the area that I work, there has been eight people that have taken their own life. One was fairly recent where I've done all the referrals that I could and he had his medication, there's nothing that I know or that anybody that I work with could have put in place more than what it was. And he took his own life last September. And the way that I cope with that is through my family and my horses. All day I face the barren waste without the taste of water. Cool clear water. >> Here's the burning question, do you believe what's going on in the last few years is climate change? >> Look. I think the climate has constantly changed. I don't think there's been any short-term thing that's made a difference. >> Personal opinion, climates change all the time don't they, Ivan? >> We're hoping that's a severely dry cycle in Australia and not climate change, because if it is climate change, this part of Australia is in deep shit. >> In the scientific community, we're starting to think it's not drought, it's really part of climate change. Australia is way past what many people consider to be the carrying capacity in terms of how much water there is. They're way past it. >> We're having an auction which we're selling around about 170 head of their cows that's starting to wind the farm down. >> We're seeing good friends go through the same issues. So we know what -- got a bit of an inkling of what we're headed for. >> What would be the hardest thing for you two to see today? >> I suppose a farm with no black and white cows on it. Anyway -- >> All day I face a barren waste without the taste of water. Cool, water. Old Dan and I, with throats burnt dry and souls that cry for water. Cool, clear water. >> The whole nature of the water cycle is changing driven by changing climate. In our new study, we found that the water cycle is intensified. That truly means a much more stormy future in many parts of the world. And then other regions will have more extreme droughts. These are first of their kind observations. There have been many studies that suggested that this may be happening in the future and our research has shown this is actually happening right now. Will the water cycle spin out of control? It's hard in the United States to fathom the scope of the potential change. And the scope is huge. >> These current findings as this is going to get people's attention. >> I don't think so. We think that we have this right to use as much water as we can get our hands on. There aren't many things that my neighbors do that drive me crazy. And one of the biggest is over-watering the yard. In arid and sub-arid regions, watering the lawn may account for 50 to 75 percent of household water use. We're talking about three times the volume of Lake Mead just to water the grass every year. >> The biggest mistake in thinking about water has always been thinking about it as disconnected from everything else. >> There are hidden costs of water in almost every product we use. >> In most households, the single largest user of water is the toilet. Now, this is a high efficiency toilet. It uses 1.2 gallons every time you flush it. There I've just wasted 1.2 gallons. The toilets in many people's homes still use 6 gallons. That's 6 billion gallons a day that we use merely to flush away human waste. >> The plan itself is an amazing process where you can actually take dirty, filthy, disgusting water and make it clean so it's fishable and swimmable in the area around New York. Understanding waste water is just one step in understanding everything about your environment. >> All this is like pretty Egyptian technology. This is just the wheel moving up and down with a simple rake embedding the tides in between the spaces and clearing the debris away. The debris that comes in is the debris that comes from our toilets, our sinks, our bathrooms, and also from the street. As emerging things change, they wind up in the waste stream that we see it here up until maybe eight years ago or so, we very rarely saw a bottled water, it's very prevalent now, the spirit of the times. I'm about to open up one of the four doors that allow you to see what goes on here. You can see the condoms floating on the top of the surface. It is what it is. If 100 pounds of waste product comes in with all that water, I have to remove 85 pounds of it and the 15 pounds remaining is legally allowed to go into the receiving water. >> The treatment sewage is a very simple biological process in which we're just speeding up nature. There's a lot of talk nowadays about chemicals coming in to the systems and antibiotics that are coming in to the systems. And those things were not -- never meant to be treated in a domestic waste water treatment plant. Right now, they cannot possibly deal with the myriad of chemicals that are out there. >> The traditional pollution scenario was a large industrial pipe sticking out of the side of a factory spewing brown gunk into the pristine waters and seeing the fish and the ducks die. Then there were a few astonishing examples of water pollution. The Cuyahoga River in Ohio burst into flames in 1969. >> It was just so bizarre. How can water catch fire? >> This case made national headlines and galvanized the environmental movement. >> People start pollution. People can stop it. >> The net result of that was the foundation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the signing of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act in the early '70s. It was originally a very strong law. But times have changed. Pollution in America is increasing rather than decreasing. In the five years between 2004 and 2009, the Clean Water Act was violated a half a million times. The old pollution was a river on fire. The new pollution is something you can't even see. >> Whether it's birth control pills, erectile dysfunction medicines, hormone supplements, our bodies absorb some of them. We excrete the rest of the chemicals, we flush them away, they go to the treatment plant and they are not removed. >> Consider vast Lake Mead. Tests have found trace levels of birth control, steroids, narcotics, and more. >> The U.S. is the leading producer of these new contaminants. We don't know how harmful these chemicals are. And there are more added all the time. The EPA approves 1 to 2,000 chemicals a year. >> The more difficult and dangerous ones are industrial contaminants. These are the chemicals that were the subject of Erin Brockovich. >> Counselors. >> The scene where -- you know, so funny to say Ed Masry and I, but Albert Finney and Julia, are on one side of the table and PG&E's defense attorneys were on the other and Julia says -- >> "By the way, we had that water brought in special for you folks. It came from a well in Hinkley." >> Why would you pick up and knowingly drink a glass of contaminated water? You wouldn't. I just think that said so much. That was my wakeup call in Hinkley. I would see the absence of wildlife, I would listen to these people's accounts of what was happening to their health. And I thought, what is happening here? What's the common denominator that is affecting all of this? And I was like, "Uh, water." And remember way back when I began my work out there in 1991 that it was an isolated incident. And it is far from anything isolated. For 20 years, I'm down on the ground. And we've got these communities, maybe they've noted too many children with cancer, the animals that are dying with tumors and we don't know what it is, you ask for their people here in this room that may have cancer or leukemias. >> Can I see a show of hands? Oh my, can you keep your hands up? >> People started looking around the room and I'm like, you have cancer. I didn't know you have that cancer. Your child has that cancer? Well, my child has that cancer. So that is what's starting to really rattle me. >> A developing story out of Midland this evening, high profile environmental activist, Erin Brockovich is in town tonight with a toxic contaminated water problem. >> Concerned residents called in Brockovich, who was a consultant for two environmental law firms to investigate. >> A year ago, one of the community members came to me. Her granddaughter was having these very strange skin rashes and sent me a picture of a swimming pool that was green. Oh yeah. Definitely greener. And I was just immediately -- I'm like, "Uh-oh, I have a feeling I know what this is, the hexavalent chromium." The reason I had to contact her is because we went through our local government. I bet I wrote over a thousand letters to all of our congressmen and legisla -- everybody. They've just failed us. >> I emailed Erin Brockovich and she emailed me back in 30 minutes. I hadn't even seen the movie Erin Brockovich. I had never seen it until after I met Erin, then I watched the movie. >> Hexavalent chromium. It's poisonous. >> Yeah. >> Oh my gosh, the biggest scene was when she's talking to the lady and she looks out there and her kids are playing in the pool. >> Ashley, Jenna, get out of the pool. >> How come? >> That's how I felt when I realized that I had been putting my grandkids in toxic water in that swimming pool. It was very, very emotional for me. My grandkids all said, "The pool hurts us." And I didn't even put it together. >> Here is Janet now and -- >> There were very high numbers of hexavalent chromium. Higher than anything I've ever seen in Hinkley. >> You can't go on city water? >> Well, if they're telling us there's no water for us. >> No water for you. >> Yeah. >> And -- just drink the poisons. >> "Not my problem." >> This is part of the 40 million Americans are still on their own well water. >> Forty million? >> Yeah. >> People just fall off the grid. >> One of the big loopholes in American water law is for so-called domestic wells. Many of these are never tested for chemicals. >> The state acted pretty quickly, they got filtration systems on there. But then that's kind of where it ends. >> Honestly, when I got the letter from the state, I really thought, you know, it said my water was safe for drinking so we haven't really stopped. I mean, we bathe, we take showers, we -- I mean, we have to. This is where we live. >> Our tests showed dangerously high levels of hexavalent chromium. That poor guy could have gone years. It could have been years that he'd consume this water. The chemical concentration of chromium-6 here in Midland is the largest I've ever seen anywhere. The concentrations are just extreme. >> My house is right here where it's 319. Right now, we're at 818. But right here, where Angie died, it was 1,100 last year. Angie lives right next door to ground zero. She passed away three weeks ago from lupus which I've got the forerunner to lupus now. >> Are you feeling okay? >> That's my -- my fear is not living long enough to take care of everybody out here and especially my grandkids. >> So what their last resort is some litigation. How long is that going to take? Fifteen, 20 years? >> You know, I just get so aggravated because they're not listening, they're not caring, and they're not even trying to find who did it. >> There was this out here that you've got -- >> This is the pits. We believe all the oil field companies dumped in that pit. >> Through our investigative work, we actually believe it's a company, Schlumberger just up the road here. >> This particular Schlumberger facility is the mother ship. Schlumberger's official statement is that they never used hexavalent chromium and the EPA's initial report never identified the source. Through further investigation, we will get to the bottom of it. What makes it so frustrating is that you can't find out what any of the chemicals are that are being deployed out into the environment under something referred to as the Halliburton Loophole. The Halliburton Loophole was pushed through by then Vice President Cheney. Cheney exempted all of the oil and gas fracking companies from the Safe Drinking Water Act. It's insanity. >> Whoa, it's good to be in Midland, Texas. I'm calling to George W. Bush is thinking right now, is the Texas airspace. >> Midland, Texas is one of North America's most aggressive in oil and gas field development. And it is the childhood home of George Bush. People don't usually poison their own neighborhoods. What's the old saying is, "You don't shit where you eat." >> We live about a block and a half west of the contaminated area. Are we really safe? >> What can we do to protect ourselves now? >> Are we still going to be declared a Superfund in your opinion? >> They can come in and issue you a Superfund status, but that ain't going to stop anything. This agency is broke. >> They don't have any money? >> Oh, EPA is broke. They got nothing. Nothing. Nothing. They have 1,200 Superfund sites now they can't do anything with. I'm telling you, Superman is not coming. >> People still believe that that arm of government is going to come save us. And the look on their face even kind of startled me. >> I wish that I could come here tonight and tell you it's going to be okay. But that's not what's going to happen and I don't want to lie to you. >> We moved here from Mesa. I've done hair there for years and I do hair here. I have more clients here with cancer, I have shaved more heads here in three years than I ever did there. And I'm just concerned about our own children are waking up with nosebleeds. >> I don't think I need to tell you nor do I want to scare you how carcinogenic hexavalent chromium is. >> You know, when we first saw the numbers, I have to tell you, some people I work with, we looked at each other and it was -- they're walking dead. And at that point for me, it gets really hard to be a cheerleader and always try to find some hope in it for them. >> If you stay together and you use your voice and you push back, you will make some progress. At least you know the truth. >> We the community, we want water. That's all we want, is good, potable water. Something when we turn on the faucet and we know it's okay to brush our teeth with it. >> Some of these chemicals can take up to 100 years to get rid of. And what are we supposed to do in the interim? I mean, there's this vast world underneath our feet that we don't see. Out of sight, out of mind, we don't see it, we don't know where it goes, and therefore, we don't pay attention. >> I've been fascinated by amphibians for as long as I can remember. So as a child, I was fascinated by metamorphosis, watching tadpoles turn into frogs. Then I ended up at Harvard where I majored in biology. And I ended up in a laboratory there where I focused on amphibian development. My work was getting fairly well-known. Fork in the road, should we take it? Twelve years ago, I've never heard of atrazine. Atrazine is an herbicide or a weed killer. Until a few years ago, it was the number one selling agricultural pesticide in the world. I was approached by the manufacturer to examine whether or not atrazine was an endocrine disruptor in amphibians. The term endocrine disruptor refers to anything that would interfere with the hormone's action. And we found that the atrazine-exposed animals weren't making testosterone properly. In some cases, the atrazine makes them make enough estrogen that they actually turn into females. These are two genetic males that were exposed to atrazine that actually developed into females. So as you can see, the males are smaller but now genetically, right, these are all males. The guy on top is a male, and that's his brother that he's on top of. It's a hard thing to describe. What does this have to do with people? Why do we care? Frogs and fish which live in the contaminated water, they're much more sensitive as they're going through these developmental stages. On the other hand, a human fetus is inside an amniotic sac filled with water, that's going through critical developmental stages where hormones are important. The same estrogen for example that makes my frogs turn into hermaphrodites, that same estrogen is important in breast cancer. When people think of science, you know, they think of CSI. In field work, you really have to sort through all these potential suspects. I think there's a line from a lot of the guys in CSI, how do you find the answer? >> Follow the evidence even if we don't like where it takes us. >> And that's really what we're doing is in this case, following the atrazine. Atrazine is the most common pesticide contaminant of drinking water, groundwater. And there're a couple of studies came out showing that atrazine is associated with breast cancer and birth defects in humans. There's a factory where Syngenta produces atrazine. The prostate cancer in their workers is 8.4 times higher. The U.S. Geological Survey says they can detect it in the rainwater in Minnesota from when they're applying it in Kansas. >> I'm the principle scientist here at Syngenta Crop Protection. On the occasions where atrazine is found in water it's extremely low in the part per billion range. >> Starting at 0.1 parts per billion, we started getting these hermaphrodites. And that's an incredible number, 0.1 parts per billion. The drinking water standard for atrazine is 3 parts per billion. That's 30 times higher than we know is biologically harmful
