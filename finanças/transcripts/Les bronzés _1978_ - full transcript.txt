♪ SUNTANNED -Good evening, Iadies and gentlemen! -Good evening! I know you're all tired from the three-hour bus ride. Unfortunately, I have some bad news for you. The police just called. We forgot to do some paperwork. You have to go back to the airport. Just kidding! Great joke. Welcome to Galasouinda! Welcome to Galasouinda! I'm Marcus, chief ofthe village. During the trip, Guylaine gave each ofyou a wonderful hut, and the GO team is waiting for you with the bags, which arrived five minutes before you by truck, to take you to the village. I'II see you tomorrow at 7:00 for breakfast. And now, goodnight to you all! Goodnight! This is a great start. -It's nicer in Paris. -It's nothing. Just a drizzle. It's raining, it's pouring! -FIashlights, quick! -It's nothing, just some blown fuses. This wasn't in the brochure! -Can we get some Iight over here? -Has anyone seen my suitcase? Excuse me, but you're stepping on my feet. -Have you seen Guylaine? -No. Are you sure that's your suitcase? I'm not in the habit oftaking other people's suitcases. I don't have my Iittle bag. They're not suitcases. It's a frog party! -What am I stepping on? -Hey, that's my bag. -Well? -Let go ofthe suitcase. -Take your suitcases. -Excuse me. -This way, this way! -This way, this way! Your attention, please! Those with huts named after seafood, Oyster, CIam, etc., this way, please. -What about me? -Let's go, this is great! We're having fun! -There's the Prawn. I'm in the Mussel hut. -Help, I twisted my ankle! I'm taking the Sole, Dab, Lemon Sole, Bass, Sea Bass and Pollack huts. As for those huts named after fruit, Guylaine has the plans down there. This way, fruit! -That way. It's that way. -The path is Iit here. Hey, wait for me! My suitcase just came open! Are you really sure that's your suitcase? Oh, get Iost. You're pissing me off. -Abalone! -What? Where's the Abalone hut? There isn't an Abalone hut. Maybe it's Apple. It's on the other side ofthe village... Occupied! -The hut is occupied. What do I do? -No, those are the toilets! -I'm Iooking for the Apple hut. -There is no Apple hut. Abalone is at the other end ofthe village. With the seafood. Unbelievable. Someone just told me that it was on this side! It really is incredible. Someone told me it was this way. Shit! Calm down, there are people sleeping in here. -Shut up, Scorpion Fish! -Hey, relax. We're on vacation. Fuck you, Belgian! Fuck you! Where did you come from? -Is there a Lost and Found? -Yes, in the Tufted Duck hut. You have to go tomorrow. It's closed at the moment, my friend. My pyjamas are in there. Enjoy your meal. Hi, how's it going? Well, you know. I was up all night with a girl. -With whom? -I don't know. A new bird that got here Iast night. I wouldn't even recognise her. We shagged in the bus during the power failure. Hey, Iook. That might be her. I think it's her. Look, Iook! It's her. -Where? -There. -Hello, Popeye. -Hello. It's her. She recognised you. How are the GO's doing? In shape? -Yes. -In the shape ofwhat? -This bloke's great, right? -Yes. -He's too much. -Oh, yes. Did you see his skit yesterday?

Come see us at Galasouinda There is sun and there are birds Jean-CIaude Dusse, of Paris. Jean-CIaude Dusse. I'm upset. I never found my suitcase. -What's going on? Are you Ieaving already? -No. But I never found my hut Iast night. -Me neither. I couldn't find my wife. -And I couldn't find my suitcase. I was forced to spend the night at the toilets with this charming woman. You know, I can be charming elsewhere besides at the toilets. Of course. It's not a big deal. We'II sort it out for you. -And what's wrong with this one? -Nothing. I'm fine. -Hi. -Hi. Gigi. It's a pleasure. -Hi. -Jean-CIaude Dusse, of Paris. -Hi. -Christiane. Bernard, nice to meet you. Well, I brought you the sun in my Iuggage. It's a good thing you didn't count on me. Because ifyou had, we'd have foul weather. 'Cause she said, "I brought you the sun in my Iuggage". So I said, "It's a good thing you didn't count on me "because ifyou had, we'd have foul weather". 'Cause I Iost my Iuggage. -Oh, yes! That's funny. -Yes, right. Listen up! AII the newcomers follow me, we're taking a picture. Yes, Ieaving. Leaving for the picture. -You, too. Come on. -It's the picture. Follow me for the picture. Listen up! Move in, I can only see half ofyou. Hey, the chap with the beard. Move over a Iittle to your right, please. That's it. Move in closer. You're hiding one another. You're hiding the Iady. Go on. Sit down. Move over. More. More to the Ieft. That's it. I can't see all ofyou. -Again, again. -Hey, that's my suitcase! That's mine! Hey, keep smiling back there. Let's go. I can't see everyone. That's it. Great. Move in a Iittle closer. Okay, don't move. One, two, three. I don't care, I'm wearing swimming trunks. It's a shame. Someone moved. Okay, so to make it up to you, fruit juice cocktails on the beach for everyone. It's offto a great start. Just wait and see. The hosts here are a bunch of clowns. Let's go! So where were you? I Iooked everywhere for you. I didn't find my hut. I had to spend the night at the toilets with a charming woman. Oh, you charmer. You cheated on me. Okay, bring your glasses over. Bring your glasses over. Come on, have a Iittle drink. It's fantastic here, isn't it? And to think, I was on Montmartre yesterday. Here. -I'II tell you a funny story. -Yeah? -You know who Edith is? -The fat one that works with computers? "The fat one." She's not fat, just a bit round. Well, her husband had a breakdown and went to the south of France to rest. The poor thing was a Iittle Ionely so I invited her to dinner a few times. -She wasn't too boring? -No, in the end I got her to Ioosen up. She relaxed. It's fantastic here! And this is where the funny part comes in. The second night I invited her to dinner, I was exhausted after the meal. I said to her, "Listen, Edith, I'm sorry, but I'm going to bed". And you know what she replied? "Bernard, I hate sleeping alone." Crazy, huh? I thought it was sweet. She stayed at the house for eight days Iike that. Relaxed. Really? But it's over now, all right? You know, finished. -Are you swimming? -No, I'm not dressed for it. You know, in the end... What happened in Paris has brought me closer to you, I think. Me, too. In a way, it brought me closer to you. -I'm glad you're taking it Iike this. -No, I don't think you understood. I meant to say that it brought me closer to you because the same thing happened to me here. Funny, isn't it? Oh, so you also... -You had a fling here? -Yes. -A GO? A GM? Anyone I know? -Well, both. There was Jean-Mi, Loulou and Miguel, the head of arts and crafts. The head of arts and crafts? Do they make nice things at arts and crafts? Yes. He made me a beautiful gift. A rattan ashtray. Well, that's nice. And functional, too. Well, if I've understood correctly, I had better hurry up because I'm two people behind. -What do we do about the hut? -What did you say? I was wondering, do you think it's off-Iimits for a couple or can we bring a date there from time to time? What are you talking about? I don't understand. You understand very well, Nathalie. Listen, Bernard. I didn't make plans. -Come swimming. It'II do you some good. -No, I'm a bit tired. I spent a dreadful night with a twat down at the bogs. -See you at dinner? -I didn't make plans. I don't know where I'II be at dinner or with whom. Shit, my shoes. Is someone there? Are you staying in this hut, too? Yes, hi. Perfect timing. Help me bring these things in. I cleaned up a bit. It was disgusting. I'm sorry, I thought I was alone. I must have taken up a Iot of room with my things. -Yes, you did. I put them there for you. -Thanks. I'm not used to it. This is my first time at the CIub. -And you? -I'm a passionate enthusiast. -Well, everyone seems very nice. -I'm a Iittle afraid. Hut villages have a reputation for Ioose behaviour. I usually stay in a bungalow, but I signed up too Iate this year. Anyway, they gave us quite the shower this morning. There you are. That wouldn't happen to bungalow people. People wouldn't accept it. You have so many beauty products! -Do you work in a department store? -No, I have a salon. I'm an aesthetician, to be precise. -Really? In which district? -No, no. Outside Paris. It's impossible in Paris. It's too hectic there. It was really amazing. We got together every Monday for two years. We saw each other on Mondays because that's when the salon was closed. Did I tell you that? He was a hairdresser. That's funny. I close my salon on Mondays, too. I used to close it on Tuesdays, but it's so inconvenient with the weekend. What are your names? His wife found out about us from one ofthe shampoo girls. And, get this, she tried to electrocute him with a hairdryer. I had tax inspectors in my beauty salon for three days. So what are your names? I was so depressed, I thought I wouldn't have the strength to come to the CIub. So he was very nice and he told me, "My Iittle Gisële, in order to save our Iove, we have to break up". -He did well. -Because my name is Jean-CIaude. You'II see. You'II get over it really quickly here. What about that bloke with the brown hair? Do you Iike him? No. Oh, no. No, you see, I prefer men that are five years older. And very distinguished, Iike Paul Newman. And, most importantly, with a slightly receding hairline. Well, then, my dear... I may seem a Iittle old-fashioned to you, but, despite my colourful past, I Iike them big, very muscular and, most importantly, blonde and with a crew cut. Like a Nazi! The two bitches can't even be bothered to answer me. Is everything okay back there? You, in the robe, is there a problem? It's hot, isn't it? I'm going swimming. -Jerk! -He's completely nuts. He's so rude. We Iike to bother Iadies, do we? -Come on! -Stop, I can't touch the bottom! -Stop, I can't touch the bottom! -Come on! Come on. Yes! Look! They stole his shorts! Bourseault gives it back. Bobo passes. Pass the ball! He takes the ball and scores! They're terrible! -Hi, girls. -You went too far. May we, fair Iadies? I don't care, I have all the time in the world. The water is great. Come on, give them back to me. It's not funny any more. Come get them. -You're arses, you know that? -Come get them. You'II catch a cold. There. Are you Ieaving? I guess we don't have the same sense of humour, huh? Keep your skis parallel and fasten the Iife vest. -Stay calm. -Yes. The boat is powerful, don't worry. -Look at him! -Fasten the Iife vest. The rope goes between the skis. Water-skiing. You can't hit... Hey, gently! Grab it by the middle. By the middle! -Grab it by the middle. -Yes, put it... There. I told you I couldn't do it! For my souvenir album. Thanks. There is sun and there are birds And the Chinese bird, the Iittle hostess, has she been taken? Yes, she's with me. And her friend with the curly hair? -She's with me, too. -Oh, okay. I'II take the nurse, then. -No. She's with me. -Oh, sorry, my friend. My mistake. -Listen up, "friend". -Yes? -There are 500 GMs here. -500? -Yes, take your pick. -Yes. -So you'II stay away from the GOs? -Yes, okay. What's the ratio of birds to blokes? -That depends on the bloke. -Yes, okay. Good evening, GM friends. Enjoyyourmeal!

She's a good friend of my grandmother's. -I'm going to sleep. -Well, it's your Ioss. No, I'm going to sleep because I feel Iike if I stayed, I'd surrender to you, I'd be a fallen woman.

You're nice, aren't you? -Would you Iike to dance? -Yes. -Would you Iike a cigarette? -Yes, please. They're just pictures of girlfriends from past years. They don't mean anything, you know. FIings, nothing more. AII right, I'm going to bed. Good night, we're going to bed. Good night, we're going to get Iaid. Bourseault is so funny! He cracks me up. Yes, he's great. He asked me if I wanted to do a routine with him in Paris. -Do you know the Chëne-Liëge? -No. That's where we'II do it. It's five minutes by train. Yes, the train is awfully practical. -Bobo, can I put my head in your Iap? -PIease do. Careful, my fringe. Pelletier! Georges Pelletier! The Séquanaise Insurance Company! You worked in disasters, I was on the second floor. Really? You were at the Séquanaise? Yes, I started when Ms Michin had health problems. -That's so funny! -Yes, funny. You had a moustache then, but you also had all your teeth. I still have them, that's varnish. Georges Pelletier! If I'd thought before coming to the CIub... Listen, Gigi... I'm through with the Séquanaise, okay? I Iost the suit, the tie, the moustache... I put an end to that entire part of my Iife. So I'd Iike this to stay between us, okay? Okay. Come on. -Bobo? -Yes? -Can we go to your hut? -Relax. We have Iots oftime. You see the stars? -Where? -The Ursa Major, right there. -The big one? -Yes. Just above the hut where they sell sausage. -Yes. -You see it? It was over there at the start ofthe season. -Yes. -Now it's there. And after we Ieave, it'II still be there. It can't be explained. It's something I Iearnt at the CIub. That's my way of saying we have time. What's on your mind? It's damp and my arse is cold. Can we go now, Bobo? Sure. Hey, wait. I'm coming. Radio Galasouinda, hello! Radio Galasouinda, hello! Hello there. It's a beautiful day. The water is minus three degrees. We're expecting snow this afternoon. lfyou go swimming, bundle up. Have a great day! 8-6, to the Ieft. Your turn. -Go back to your position. -Oh, please. -Are you in shape? -I'm in perfect shape to Iie down. I got it! I got it! 8-7! Would you Ieave me alone? -Go back to your position. -I am in my position. -You got in my wayjust now. -Oh, stop it. Swimming competition in the pool at noon! Sign up for it. In the pool at noon Hi. -How are you, Pelletier? -Good. So, girls, are you signing up for the swimming competition? No, not me. I swim Iike a rock. -Really? -I'd Iike to participate, but I only do the sidestroke. -See you soon. -Really? -And you do... -Yes. A Iittle sunbathing and I'II be right back. I'm going for a Iittle walk. See you soon. -Hi. -Hi. -What are you doing? -What time is it? -11:00. Did you sleep there? -Yes. You didn't find your hut? I did, but I got stuck with a bloke who snores. I got sick of Iying awake, so I came here to sleep. I didn't sleep a wink all night. I was attacked by bugs. They're pretty harmless around here. I'II show you my arms. The mosquitoes had a feast. After that, a Iizard came into the bag. I'm gonna have to be brought back by Europ Assistance. There's no doubt about it, you'II see. Don't get carried away. You just got here. I'm not, I can't handle the sun any more. I Iike climates that aren't so damp. Normandy, the Evre, all that. You can't stay in there all day. Go for a dip. You need a kick start, you're turning blue. -I'm turning blue? -Yes, yes. Be careful, my friend. Come on, Iet's go. On your marks. Get set! Hey, Popeye! Let me through, I'm a doctor. By the hair! Grab him by the hair! By the hair! There. Wait. Give him your arm. Poor Iittle guy. -Are you all right? -Feeling better? Do you think we should take him to the infirmary? No, no, we'II get him to bed, he'II cough up some water and be just fine. He's crazy. He's a pain. Here it comes. No! No! No! Leave me alone! No! Don't Ieave! -Calm down! Calm down! -Leave me alone! Doctor, I just recently Iearnt that a drowned person can be resuscitated even 24 hours Iater, ifthe water is very, very cold. -No. -No? No, not 24 hours. Two or three hours tops. Actually, it sets off a very simple process that blocks the alveoli. It's called the diving reflex. It occurs most notably in marine mammals, such as whales, sperm whales, et cetera. I get a rash every time I go swimming, and the back of my throat gets itchy. It's nothing. It's probably caused by the sea water. Save my seat, I'm going to get some peaches. As for me, I have gears that creak every time I shift my 504 into second. -Is it serious, Doctor? -Listen, just bring it in to the clinic and we'II do an X-ray. My husband Ioves Peugeots. -Really? -Right, Bernard? -Do you know how to drive? -No. Parallel parking always throws me off. -Hey, there's the drowned man! -Jean-CIaude. -Can I have a seat? -PIease do. It's free. -You scared us. -Yes. He's doing better. -So, I got my kick start. -Yes. -Get a move on! Go! -It'II be good this time. -Lift your arm. -Give it your best! -AImost! -Fantastic! Are we coming back tomorrow? The hairdresser did a great job. -Really. Don't you think? -It's spiffy. It's hot in here. It's short, huh? It's short, but well shaped. That makes the haircut. -It's a groomed cut. -That's true. Are you sure he knows what he's doing? -Yes, are you kidding? -Of course! He knows it empirically, but he does know it. -Next. -Him. -No, go on. I'm not in a hurry. -No. No, go on, because he's better when you go first. -I went yesterday. Go on. -Yes, go on. -Well? -You don't need persuading. Are there birds in there or something? PIease be gentle because I'm not feeling well. I hurt myself skiing. Okay, everything's fine. Wait! He already did this! He already did this! Yes, that's it. The kidneys! Gently! We have Iots oftime. Thank you, mates. Thank you. It's helping. He's pulling my hair! He's pulling my hair! It's okay. Thank you. It's cold! Oh, that's good, that's good. It's scalding hot! This is crazy. This is nuts! No, gently. I was just at the hairdresser's. No, not the eyes. Don't wash the eyes. Okay. What's he doing to me? What's he doing? I was afraid ofthis. This is great, don't you think? These people are getting on my nerves. Wait, we'II take a group picture with the kids. -Okay, okay. -With the Polaroid. Christiane, will you take the picture? -It's the picture... -Then I won't be in it. No problem. We'II take a picture ofyou next. -Go on, take the picture. -Come on, Iet's go. Okay, kids, come over here. -Where should I go? -I'II show you. -AII right. -Come stand beside me, Bernard. Move in nice and close. Smile. You just have to push that green button. -Okay? -Okay. -How's that, Bernard? -Okay, go ahead. Stop! -Christiane, what did you do? -I don't know. I did exactly what you told me to do. -My poor Christiane. -Look at this mess! My poor Christiane, how could you be so stupid? It's incredible. A two-year-old could figure it out. Would that Iook good on me? -No, not at all. -No? It's not easy with blonde hair, you know. Do you have this but with Iong sleeves and a closed collar? No, it's worn Iike that. You'II overheat. Well, yes, but I have to cover myself. I get bad sunburns. I have fair skin. -Use Iotion. -I can't, I'm allergic. Do you want to try my sun block? -How much for the statue? The mask? -30,000 francs. -How much? -30,000 francs. -I Iike it. I'm taking it. -Wait, wait. I'II bargain it down for you. -How much did you want for the statue? -I said 30,000. You must be kidding. It's worth 15,000 francs. No, 30,000. -20,000 francs. -No, 30,000. -25,000. -No, 30,000. -27,000, plus the tam tam. -No, give me 30,000. Okay, fine. Give him 30,000. He's an idiot. Thank you. Say, you know your stuff. Look! I went a bit crazy. It was Iove at first sight. -What do you think? -It's very, very nice. It's very much your style. I'm thrilled. Thrilled! -What are you wearing? -Lotion, to prevent sunburns. You should try shoe polish. Skin is Ieather, after all. Really? Something wrong? It's as ifthey've never seen a woman before. They put their hands on her arse. We should file a complaint. No. It is despicable, though. -It's nice, huh? -You think? It's not bad. -Hi. -Hi. How much for the spices? -100 francs. -100 francs. He's not bored, is he? I'm sure they earn a year's worth during this month. I'II take the red ones. -They're so red! -Yes. You're not bargaining? No, not for the spices. -There you are. Thank you. -Thank you. -Careful, sir. It's very strong. -Yes, I know. See these green peppers? They're a Iittle strong, but excellent. I Iove them. I can eat tonnes ofthem. -You want one? -No, thank you. I can't handle them. You're a nitwit, they're an aphrodisiac. By the way, where is your wife? -One second. -Yes. About what we were discussing before... I thought it over and I agree. To what? Well, what we talked about the other night. I didn't agree then, but I've thought about it and... I mean, we can sleep together ifyou want. It's too Iate now. Really? -Maybe it's better that way. -What? -I said, maybe it's better that way. -Yes, maybe. -So, Miguelito? -Do you want a martini? -I know what you're thinking. -Yes, be careful. -Oh, shit. What day is it? -The 17th. Damn! You know, I completely forgot. I have to do inventory tonight. What inventory? Well, I have to... I have to count the equipment. We itemise all the balls, the doodads, the flippers, the masks. It takes hours. Can't you do it tomorrow? No, because people use them during the day. That's the problem, you see. That's why... You know what we should do? You go back to your place, and I'II come over if I finish early, okay? Okay. -What hut are you in? -Banana. Banana. Okay. AII right, bye. Come on, sweetheart, I worked it out. Shit! Hey, Jerome, it's not getting better. You're all green. -Maybe the peppers were rotten. -I don't know, but there's gurgling. I read about something incredible, it's a soy-based anti-hydraulic. They already have it in the US and Japan. It won't reach France for at Ieast 10 years since the market is completely blocked by trusts. Watch out. I have a feeling the tall guy is going to shag your wife. I'm going to the infirmary. Bye. I have the runs... So, are you happy? It's funny. I didn't think I would shag you. -Really? -I swear. I didn't think I'd have the time. You want a shoe horn? No, it's fine. I always buy them a Iittle too smalI and then they're pain to take off. Let me tell you something that will make you happy. -Yes? -Yes. I've shagged over 80 birds since the season started. And, without exaggerating, I have the feeling you'II be in the top 10, 15. That makes me very happy. -You're very tidy for a bloke. -Yes, that's why I'm always impeccable. The first time I saw you, I said to myself, "He should be in movies". In powerful movies where things happen, -Iike Maciste, Hercules:. -Yes. There are bad ones, too, you know. Yes, I've seen some that have made me Iaugh. I've seen some bad ones. But anyway, I could never do it. My arms are too small. I couldn't even pick you up if I wanted to. Watch this. Look at poor embarrassed Maciste. -It's Maciste! -Popeye! Oh, stop it. You make me Iaugh. You know, people who don't know you, get the impression that you're a block of concrete. And yet, deep down, you're rather fragile. Why do you say that? Because of my foot? No, I wanted to say that you're fragile in the head. In my opinion, you're so incredibly sensitive that you have to Iet women have you easily. Birds? Me? Okay, okay. Only one woman ever had me, and that was my wife. And I respect her. And I can tell you that she's not the Iast slut to bed the first arsehole who comes along. AII right. Popeye, you should change your underwear. These are fine, aren't they? They're from this morning. No, it's not that. It's the shape. It ruins the persona a Iittle. Well, worry not, my dear. It doesn't ruin what's inside. So, tell me. Your husband doesn't care? You know, you could play Iike him ifyou practised for half an hour a day. It's very effective, but it's actually quite simple. It's based on a technique of arpeggios and broken chords. And harmonically, it's very elementary. It's major chords, dominant sevenths. -Oh, yeah? That's it? -Yes, that's it. It is pretty, though. Yes, but it's not very satisfying for a musician. Have you been a musician Iong? I played classical piano at the 11th district conservatory for four years. I'm working on the harmonica now which I enjoy more, especially since I travel a Iot. Hey, do you know Michael, RowyourBoatAshore? It's C, F, G. AII right? -It doesn't Iook Iike it. -Yes. You seem very sad. I'm tired. It was the excursion. Something to drink? Would you Iike a brochette? No, thank you. I just had a beer. I don't Iike to mix in this heat. -Okay, I'm going for a walk. -Wait, I'II come with you. Well, I'm going to sleep. -Shit, the towel's there. -So? The towel is a code. Popeye is with a friend and is not to be disturbed. You're pissing me off. You've done this three nights in a row. -Why, do you need it straightaway? -Well, yes. -Did you pick up? -Yes. Who are you doing? -Christiane. -Oh, the Iittle devil. You know, a big chimney Iike that must blow pretty well. -What's he saying? -Nothing, nonsense. -Hey, Bobo! -Yes? Bring her in. We don't mind. We'II keep warm. -Are you serious? -Yes. Okay, wait. I'II check. Here's the situation, Popeye is with a friend but he said we could go in ifwe want. It really wouldn't bother him. Why not have an orgy while we're at it? Oh, God, no. Let's go to my hut. Gigi's never there. What a drag. It's at the other end ofthe village. Come on, Bobo. You know, the foursome thing never occurred to me. It's filthy with four people. Even with two it's disgusting. It's wonderful when a friendship blooms between a man and a woman. It's the best. See, for example, I'm walking you back to your hut. That doesn't mean that something is going to happen. We're...friends. -You're wife's not waiting for you? -No, we're a very Iiberal couple. Well, more her. If I want to have a drink with a friend in the evening without her knowing, no problem. Christiane's not coming back? I'm not intruding? Christiane spends her nights on the prowl and she never brings anything back. The poor thing. I'm here to have a friendly chat with you, but ifyou want to sleep, just Iet me know. It's no problem. Oh, it doesn't bother me at all. It's so rare to be able to talk Iike this, as friends. It's great that I can undress in the same room as a man without having to worry. You think? I find it so surprising that people haven't even -tried to understand... -Not so Ioud. You'II wake everyone up. We should just bring the beds closer so we don't have to shout. I'm shot. I have a feeling I'II fall asleep next to you without the slightest worry, as friends. You know what, Bernard? This reminds me ofwhen I was Iittle. We weren't supposed to make any noise at night at summer camp. So we would tell funny stories under the sheets. -We'd Iaugh so hard. It was great. -Yes, great. What's gotten into you, Bernard? -I thought we were here as friends! -Don't worry. It's purely sexual. -Gigi, are you there? -Don't come in! -Why not? Are you with someone? -She's with a friend. She's with a friend. What should we do? Should we go to the beach? No. We just walked 15 kilometres. I can't keep going. I'm worn out. Shall we reschedule for tomorrow? Bye. Don't hold this against me, okay? -You want to play Scrabble in my hut? -Yes, gladly. So, Gigi, have you seen Bernard? I've Iooked for him everywhere. We don't see each other any more. I prefer it that way. Why? Was he rude to you? No. But... Even ifyou're very Iiberal, I'm still a bit uncomfortable because ofyou. -Did he talk to you about... -No. We don't usually tell each other all the Iittle details of our private Iives. It would take too Iong. I made a blunder. Rest assured, Nathalie, what happened between us was purely sexual. That reassures me. It was the night you were flirting with Popeye. He was very, very sad, I was sitting on his Iap and suddenly I felt his desire surge, since he was embarrassed and all, to make a Iong story short, I invited him to my hut. -I'II take these three. How much? -300. But we talked a Iot, too. I have a special talent for getting men to talk. -Very, very quickly, they share everything. -Yes, I'm sure. Nathalie, are you mad at me? Not at all. Could you put stamps on those for me? I'm used to it. He already had an affair with a twit in Paris so... Thank you. They're nice, aren't they? That's infuriating. Yeah, he stinks. He doesn't play well at all. -It's not easy to play against a weaker bloke. -Or against a stronger bloke, right? Yes, that's right. One minute. It's been in the sun, obviously. It bounced wrong. AII right, my mistake. -Bravo! -Yes, good job. It was good, but it wasn't on purpose. -What's the score? -8-20. For who? Okay, 21. You'II never get it. Twenty-one. The ball, por favor. Macaroni-man is not bad. I didn't Iike him from the start. Are you coming? -Are you coming? Where are you, Nathalie? -I got caught on a branch. Give me your hand. -Do you know where you're going? -Yes, we're almost there. It's really worth it to get away from the beach. Is it much further? I'm exhausted. No pain, no gain, my dear. I wish I was a kid so I could build myself a cabin. Here it is. I could sit for hours without speaking in a place Iike this. Just contemplating. It's true. There's nothing to say. It's true, I have nothing to say. "Azure, our beasts Ieapt with a cry "I awake, dreaming Anibe's black fruit "In its wart-Iike and truncated cup" Saint-John Perse. Do you always recite Saint-John Perse with your arse hanging out? It helps. Come swimming. The water's great. Come on. How Iong have you and Bernard been married? Five years. It's funny that you ask me that. -Does it concern you? -Yes and no. I think you're a wonderful couple. -Really? -Yes. You're both very independent, very in touch with your desires. It's true, your husband goes from pillar to post. You sleep with Popeye. And you seem fine with it. Yes, we seem fine with it. Nothing. Come on, come swimming. The water is great. -I just hurt myself. -Your Iittle spot here is a Iandfill. -I'm sure there are rats. -There aren't any rats. -Where are you going? -Poorjerk. "Poorjerk"? What are you talking about? Come on, don't be silly. The water's great. There's an animal! There's an animal! Wait for me, there's an animal. Up! Up! Okay, here we go. Let's go! -You're Ieaning forward too much. -Give him the skis. Put your cap on properly. Let's go. Get in the water. No, no... Go on. Hold him by the shoulders. -Give it your best shot. -Wait. The Galasouinda sports team is pleased to offer champagne to our friend Big Lenny, who managed to stay on his water skis after 14 tries. Thanks to our instructor, Anne-Marie. -Okay, the kiss. -Yes. -And now... -Popeye, I fell flat on my arse! Champagne for everyone! Come on, Bernard. What are you doing? Ifyou take big rocks you won't get them to skip! Let me try. Oh, no! Did you hurt yourself, Bernard? -Did you hurt yourself? Did you get dirty? -I fell. -What are you doing? -I hit someone on the forehead! Let's get out of here. -Say, "Truck". -Why? -Say, "Truck". -Okay, fine. Truck. -Honk, honk! -Oh, no. Now you say... You say, "Shoe". Shoe. What is she doing? No. They weren't expensive. Hey! No, not my bag. That's going too far. No, Nanard. Stop. Stop! No! -We're crazy. We're so crazy. -We're crazy but it's good. Listen, Bernard, I just got scared all of a sudden. Don't be scared. Do you have a cigarette? Do you have a cigarette? -Can I sit with you? -Yes. -What? -Am I interrupting? -No. -No. I'm sorry. I don't usually tell my Iife story but since I absolutely must talk to someone... We were the only ones around, huh? Yes, that's right. Do you have a Iight? I don't. Give me a minute. It doesn't say "tobacco" here. I got back home and my wife was in bed with the equipment. -With what? -Mimi, the head of equipment. He's a poor bloke, stays for the season to upkeep the... Since he was always alone, we thought he was gay. He wasn't. -I'm going to smash his head in. -Listen, Popeye, don't overreact. You're not the first person this has happened to. -Well, you're used to it, obviously. -Excuse me? I don't know what you bench press with that physique ofyours but... -I manage. -Go on, cry about it. Well, I'm going back home. She must have gotten pissed off or something. I understand. She has no idea how much she hurt me. PIus, it happened at a bad time. This evening, for example, I was almost happy to go back. -Struck out, eh? -Shut up, would you? And what's more, it's extremely hard for me. I grind my teeth but I have cavities. It hurts Iike hell. I know that I may seem Iike a block of concrete, but in reality, I'm incredibly fragile in my head. Actually, it was your wife who told me that Iast night. Listen, that's enough. We can do without your comments. -I'm pissing you off. -Yes. -Yes, I see that I'm pissing you off. -No. Can you hand me another cigarette? I'm gonna need it. Shit! It's been a crazy night. After I saw that, I went for a swim to try and forget it all, and some asshole threw a rock at my forehead. I can't cope any more. Hey, my... -What is it? -Don't Ieave with my pack. Right. I'II Ieave you one, okay? AII right, bye. He's astounding. Touching. Ifyou didn't know him, you might think he was narrow-minded. And Iater you see... You see that he's ajerk, yes. I think that he's very vulnerable. And as a woman, I want to protect him. You don't? No. I'd rather protect others. He's so stupid he's entertaining. He should be in the circus. -You're harsh, Bernard. -No. He goes from pillar to post, but he can't bear his wife doing the same thing. It's deplorable. It's natural. It's instinctive. He reacted Iike a child. It's heartbreaking, isn't it? Yes, yes. Listen, Christiane, Iet's think about the two of us. Yes. Yes. Give me your Iips. Hey, whatever your name is. -What's your name again? -Christiane. You want to see something, Christiane? -Will you wait for me? -Yes. Bernard, I'II see you tomorrow. Bye, friend. Thanks. No plans, no plans. Popeye. PIease be very careful, I'm not on the pill. I bet you think I'm a Ioose woman. Bastard! The bastard! Hi. Are you alone? Where's your wife? I don't know where my wife is. I'm feeling a Iot better. I'm starting to get used to the sun, the set-up, everything. I ate with the Germans. They're really nice. It's funny, I don't speak their Ianguage at all and I still had a wonderful night. They sang war songs for me in four-part harmony. We got along great. I exchanged glances with a bird. I think there may be a chance. Really? Are you thinking of my wife? No, why? Is your wife thinking about me? The chap who drops a clanger. -Do you have a cigarette? -Yes. No, I'II take the pack. I'II need it. Bye. So you think there might be an opportunity with your wife? Okay, I'm going to sleep. Oi Tsuki forward. Back. That's good. Jean-CIaude, calm down, okay? Okay, we're going to see a new kick. Today we'II see Mawashi Geri, a circular kick. It's called a Mawashi Geri circular kick, because it's a kick that's circular. Jean-CIaude, you're the most advanced, come stand across from me. Watch out for the floating ribs, okay? No, only we need to salute. Okay, so Jean-CIaude is on guard, and I'm standing southpaw. Okay, now. AIthough Mawashi is a circular kick, you don't do it with a straight Ieg, making a circle Iike this. There would be no power, it would be a kick... Like this, for example. See? There's nothing at all, you see? There's nothing at all, Jean-CIaude. Mawashi is a much more powerful kick than that. Not when I pick up a cigarette. The greeting isn't systematic. Okay, Mawashi is done in three stages. First stage, raise the knee to the side. Second, the knee goes towards the opponent, the supporting foot pivots. In the third stage, the foot will hit the opponent's head. Here we are. Shit, I pulled a muscle. -Did you hurt yourself? -Damn it! It's the groin. Jean-CIaude, you continue the class. Careful. We'II begin with a fairly fundamental exercise that will prevent you from taking a beating in a competition. That is to say, blocking. Christiane, please come here. We'II do a Iittle demonstration. I can't. I feel a slight case of kyphosis coming on. Okay, then, Gigi. So this exercise consists of her attacking me however she Iikes. I have no prior knowledge of her attack. And I'II block that attack using the appropriate technique. -Okay? -Yes. When you're ready. -That's so annoying. -What? I attacked. Okay, you come here. You'II attack me in a blunt and manly way, and I'II block. Don't rush the movement, okay? Let it come from within. It has to come from far away, it's Japanese. -When you're ready. -Careful, I'm not wearing my box. In a competition, you wouldn't say to your competitor. No, but I'm not interested in competing. You don't know, mate. It goes a Iot faster than you think. Here, Iook. Proof. It hasn't even been two years. When you're ready. You don't feel it? Okay, don't do it. That's right. -Attack! Attack! -Shit! -You don't attack from behind. -Come on, mates. -I'II put a hole in your thorax, you jerk! -I'm taking away your Iicence! -This is garbage. -Jean-CIaude! Your Iicence. Leave me alone! Good! Good! Very nice. Put some black on there to accentuate. Accentuate, my boy. Accentuate. Good. The yellow's good. Very good! Don't forget that Iight colours add contours to the curve. Look at her winking. Good. It's dull, it's dull. Tell me, did you Iose the key? Yes. Well, no. You Iike that, you pervert. Bravo. Look. Look at how the female body can become an amazing field of investigation for pictorial art. Very good! Dirty! Nil! Two! Hey. Are you the one that makes the nice rattan ashtrays? No, why? My wife told me there was an arts chap who makes nice rattan ashtrays. I Iove rattan. Ifyou hear anything about the bloke that makes rattan ashtrays, Iet me know. Sure. Good, very poetic. I think the bloke down there just invited me to an orgy. -Really? You think? -I'm sure. Remember, hitting each other with the paddles is not allowed. You're also not allowed to hang on to another person's canoe. Get ready to start! On your marks. Ready? Wait, I'm seasick. One, two, three. One, two, three... We have to change our course. This isn't good. Look at that! Come on, push a Iittle. -How's that? -You bunch of shitheads! Come on, we're winning. He's helping with his hands. He can't do that. -Who cares? We're in the Iead. -You're pissing me off. Shit! Bourseault! Wait, we're coming. It's down that way. -You take the canoe back, I'm wiped out. -Help! Quit your nonsense. Can't you see it's heavy? Watch out for the caymans, there are a Iot ofthem. What ajerk! I can't do it. I'm not a man. Christiane can't do it. She said she's not a man. It's true! And for the winners ofthe canoe race, -hip, hip, hip... -Hurray! -Contact! -Contact! -Motor! -Motor! And cheers! That went well, huh? Yes. It was pretty difficult 'cause we had to row a Iot. -Christiane! -Yes? This is André. I was telling your friend that it's a bizarre way of paddling. Bravo. You did well. The sea is awfully dangerous after all, isn't it? It's calm here. But in GIénan, there are holes that are six or seven metres deep. When you're sick, you can't go down. Pardon me? I noticed that you were in the opposite direction. He assured me that he'd done it before. CIearly, he'd never done it. So he crashed. Those canoes are made to carry pineapples. You need six tonnes of pineapples. You sit back, and then you can paddle. It's funny. I don't know if it's the sea air or what, but I have the feeling I'm going to sleep Iike a Iog tonight. Well, we won. We won. The first time I noticed you, André, was the day you stole Jean-CIaude's shorts and put them on his head. -I was dying of Iaughter. -Really? I Iike that. It's so rare to meet a girl with a sense of humour. Hold me. -Do you Iove me? -Of course. I adore you, Gigi. I'II repeat the order and then we're ready. An order of mussels, an order of chips, two fried eggs, Number 4's cheque, sauerkraut with meat, two caramelised apples, an order of boiled beef, two coffees, one mixed, the Munster that walks, the Camembert that follows. Mind your backs! I pack, I demand, I remove. Hello, kitchen? I knock and I say, "Toasted bread with hop buds, a white hat, "an order of mussels, an order of chips, two fried eggs, Number 4's cheque". Good, huh? Bourseault! Bourseault! Bourseault! Bourseault! -One more! One more! -Go on. Yes! No, no. The mayonnaise is just right. We shouldn't touch it. Wait, I'II do the suitcase bit. One more! One more! One more! Wait, Bobo. One more! One more! Refund! You were fantastic, honey. -I performed for you tonight. -Really? I got a cramp. Poor guy. Come on, quick. Music. Let's go. "Number 4's cheque, boiled beef, two caramelised apples, an order of..." To you! -Cheers! -Cheers! Do you know this one? My dear mother... Can I have some water, please? -What did you think ofthe show? -It was really great. Bourseault made me Iaugh so hard I cried. He's hilarious, yes. And the suitcase bit? Good, good. I didn't understand if it was crude on purpose or ifthere was ajoke... -It was figurative. -Oh, I see. -Bobo, can I buy you a drink? -Whisky. A whisky. It's for me. Bobo, the suitcase bit, no more, okay? Well, no... Well, I... You want a drink, Bobo? -A Iittle champagne for me. -Corked, huh? -Champagne? Whisky? -A double. And a double whisky for Bobo. Here we go! You hit it hard. You're drunk. I was dying of Iaughter behind the scenes. Look! Hey, your suitcase thing, -was that about me? -What? Because I can have as many suitcases as I want. -I don't understand. -Yes, yes. I understand. -It's okay, then. -No, it's not! Hi, Paulo. Is there any Comté Ieft? -Riche Monts? -Yes, Riche Monts will do. -And bread, too, please. -Yes, yes. There's always bread. Go on, take the tray. Here, you can carry the bread. That way, you'II be sure to have some. Bye, Paulo. Wait. Can you take the tray and wait for me outside? I have to tell Paulo something. -Yes. -Okay? How much? -Say a number. -I don't know. Forty? Forty-two? 44.5. -And what's the total? -It is 3,827 tonnes. Wow. That means I've shagged 3,827 kilograms worth of birds. I disgust myself sometimes, you know? -And you, how many do you have? -125. -Well, mate, you should get on it. -And that was in one go. Okay, yes. Sir, ma'am. So? What happened with Iast night's girl? Well, I don't know how old she is, but she Iikes cock. -Excuse me, sir, ma'am. -It's nothing. Really? Look, here she is. -Hi, Popeye. -Hi. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. -Come here. -Are you going swimming, Popeye? -You want some pineapple? -No, thank you. -Popeye! -Quit fooling around! Come on, Popeye. Shit. -You're crazy. -I call that a rollmop. An order of rollmops, an order of mussels, an order of chips, two fried eggs... It's my turn! Wait, Bourseault. Big Bourseault is jumping. Go, Bourseault! -Come on! -Go! We should give him a hand. Gigi? -Yes? -Come here. -Wait. -I have to talk to you. -It's about Bourseault. -Listen, Bobo, we had a moment, I Iike you a Iot, but it's over between us now. I'm experiencing something sensational with Bourseault, I'm completely bursting... -Listen, Gigi... -No, Bobo. Drop it. I want to be friends, but Iet's Ieave it at that. Okay, but that's not it at all. What I have to tell you is... I don't know how to tell you without hurting you. I don't want to be tactless. Listen, Bourseault is dead. He was stung by a stingray. It's awful. We were on the boat, messing around. André dived in to make us Iaugh. He said, "Beep, beep" and we responded. The stingray stung him, and he sunk Iike a rock. It's awful. Here, I brought you his flippers. I thought you would Iike that. Hey, Gigi. Are you eating? There's fish. It's delicious, it's stingray! What's with her? Gigi! Poor Gigi will do anything to make herself interesting. -I didn't even say it maliciously or anything. -No, you didn't. I think there's something going on between Bobo, Nathalie and Bernard. I've noticed that there's friction between Bernard and Nathalie. You know, Nathalie's benefiting from it. The entire camp has bedded her. You haven't? -Me? No. -Well, why not? I walk on eggshells around women. I've had a rough year emotionally. -Me, too. I had tax inspectors in my salon. -And I had a break-up. We Iived together for 48 hours before she decided that we were separating. I didn't handle it well. I even tried to kill myself. How? No one gets very original at those times. I put on AIbinoni's adagio and swallowed two tubes of Iaxatives. I Iost 16 kilograms and my carpet. -That's annoying, huh? -And I never really recovered from it. Especially my digestion, it's not Iike it used to be. So you think I might have a chance with Nathalie? -You and Nathalie? -Yes. It's so obvious. She's been wanting it since the beginning. Yes, but there's the husband. He doesn't care. Frankly, I'd be wrong to deprive you of it. Life is pretty funny. I don't mind telling you, I haven't touched anyone since I got here. I came close. And when you think about how much we pay, Jean-CIaude... Then all of a sudden, there's one opening after another. Crazy. Would you make a Iittle room for me? Excuse me. There. I made you a beautiful fruit cup. To do it right, I would need a candied cherry. Do to it right, you should have peeled the banana. You think so? Would you Iike to go for a walk on the beach with me? -No, I'm going to take a nap. -Yes, she's staying with me. I'm staying with Raymond OIiver. He's taking care of me. -No, seriously. -I don't know. Maybe I'II talk to Bernard about it. It'II make him Iaugh. -No, I don't think so. -I do think so. -Bernard, you know what he said to me? -No, stop! Stop. I'm sure it will make you Iaugh. -Do you know what he suggested? -No, he doesn't. He suggested that I sleep with him. I was joking. I had no idea what I was saying. To do it right, I would need a candied cherry. Bernard, don't get upset. Fuck, that makes me mad. The whole camp's done her. -Are you Ieaving Sunday? -Yes. Eight days is pretty short, huh? Bernard, wait for me. I'm sick ofthis. Bernard? What ifwe stopped this nonsense? -Are you tired? -Yes, I'm tired. Me, too. I wanted to tell you, those three blokes before you arrived? That wasn't true. Bitch! The first one to the barge shags the other! The butterfly. -Are you doing better, Gigi? -Yes, she's doing much better. She'II come to the clinic for a week for a check-up. If it's not better by then, we're considering a Iittle psychotherapy. I can't touch the bottom! I can't touch the bottom! Don't worry. Calm down. -I can't touch the bottom, Jerome. -Calm down. Jean-CIaude, are you coming? We're going. I'm staying another eight days. I think I have an opportunity here. There were some jerks this week. Not all ofthem. I met a really nice Swiss psychoanalyst. -Really? So what are you doing now? -I'm Ieaving. I'm taking the bus in two hours with the Belgians. So you're really Ieaving. -What are you going to do? -I don't know. I can't take it any more. I thought I could do what I wanted here but once I try something original, Iike the suitcase bit, it gets rejected. I'm going to Paris. You're right. Maybe the suitcase will work better in Paris. Because people are more relaxed, they're coming from work and all that. I'II meet up with Bourseault's friends. I'm sure they'II help me. You shouldn't stay here. You should do something else. You know, I... You know, if I wanted to... For example, I have the opportunity to go back to Pétrole Hahn. I would just have to Ieave on the weekend. Well, I've seen you do a season here and you seem to Iike it. Maybe it's your thing. You say that because ofthe nice women, right? A tan makes all the difference. I, for example, was never able to really interest a bird. I don't know why, really. -Stop, you'II make me cry. -No, it's true. Things have been a drag with my wife, too, since we got here. -Oh, well. -Go on, it'II be better tomorrow. Are you sure you don't want to stay another week? You might find your match in the new group. Bye. Hey, Bobo? -What's you name? -Georges. -AII right. Bye, Bobo. -Bye, mate. So you're Ieaving me all alone? You know I'm staying until the end ofthe season, right? It'II work out for me, Bobo. I'm staying. Well, there they are, the new arrivals. Damn, there are some pretty ones. Hey, Bobo. Look! Wow, they're beautiful. Damn! Look at the Iittle one with... The Iittle one in blue! And her friend, behind her with the bag. Look at that! That one's for you, huh? It's us.
