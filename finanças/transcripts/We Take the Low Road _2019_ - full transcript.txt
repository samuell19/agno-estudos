Surprised nobody else has gotten to you yet, you being a big-time CEO and all. Half the executives at Cabalera have been taken out. And yet... I find you jogging through your neighborhood like nothing's ever happened. Your name and your address all over the internet, man. You're on the list. Did you miss that? You know, I did my research. It was you, your company that marked up my cancer medication by over 15,000% That is exactly why Medigate even happened. And you know, I thought about it. I thought about paying you, what you would, what you would charge me for my treatment. I thought about bankrupting myself, my family, I did. I'm Stage Four. Okay. Since everybody else is doing it... this felt like the most satisfying option. Welcome back to Left, Right and Reasonable, America's most trusted radio broadcast. If you're just tuning in, we are talking Medigate, which is, I'm sure you know by now, an information leak that contains thousands of documents proving collusion between our government and pharmaceutical and medical insurance companies. But more importantly, it proves that they are making billions of dollars while millions of Americans die as a direct result of their greed. So now you have a bunch of angry Americans taking the law into their own hands and assassinating people on that list because they see them as murderers. It's happened in 15 different states, and just yesterday there was another grisly murder in Michigan that has Medigate written all over it. No, hold on, it's beyond grisly. This guy is a father of three, and he chopped a man up with a chainsaw. Oh, and by the way, the media coverage seems to glorify his motives instead of condemning them, which they have done for almost all of the Medigate murders. Well, rich people are killing people and other people are killing those rich people. It seems like eye for an eye, Old Testament justice. - Eye for an eye? - Think for a minute. What's the difference between killing somebody by denying them health care and shooting them dead in the street? The headline, that's it. Jerry, you're normalizing this. I mean, we're talking about the death penalty without a judge or a jury. Whatever happened to due process? You want to ask me what happened to due process? I want to ask you, what happened to the middle class? I mean, they've polled average Americans, conservatives, liberals, atheists, religious groups, there is no consensus... Honey, I don't think you should go back to Washington for a few weeks. This is starting to get scary. Molly, 15 minutes. Yeah, I... Shut up, yeah, I said, I saw it. God, you worry about everything. If you're so worried about it, upgrade your security. I just had a new system installed here. It's bad-ass. You know what? Molly is giving me that same line. Listen, I wasn't worried, but I am certainly not playing any games. Paul. Paul, Paul, calm down, man. You're going to give yourself another heart attack. And then I got to come down and eulogize you to a room full of empty chairs and explain to your brain-dead kids, who will likely be on their phones the entire time, that their father is a panicky little bitch. Yeah, you're scared, I get it. We're all on the list, but half these fuckers are inner-city Section Eight tweekers on a bender, and Uber doesn't make drops out here. So will you fucking relax? Paul, stop. Listen, rather than calling me every three hours, why don't you go get a gun? Put it under your pillow. Or get a rottweiler, I don't give a shit. But you're a senior executive, so whatever you do, fucking execute. Michael, what was that? Is everything okay? There is no consensus. Even with the political parties, it's a hung jury. Sorry for your loss. - Who's she? - Go get her. And you, would you quit with the fucking ammonia already? Did you get shot? No, we've been through this. Their DNA is fine, your DNA is bad, okay? Now, where's the safe? Thompson, where's the safe? Come on, come on, wake up, let's go. 911, what's your emergency? I need help. I need help, there's people in my house. What is your location, ma'am? Ma'am, I'm going to need you to calm down. - What is your location, ma'am? - 334 Briarwood Court. What the hell? - I thought there'd be money here. - Is that blood? Please, please hurry, you need to send somebody. They're downstairs. You shouldn't have done that. Now what am I going to... What... Shit, all right, you deal with this. Fuck! I'm sorry. What's the holdup? Hey, what happened? I don't know. She, uh, she came at me, and... she fell and... she hit her head. Jesus. Hey. Hey, it's okay. This was an accident. It's not your fault, okay? Look, there's nothing we can do about it. She called the cops. - She called the cops? - She called the cops? Let's go, put your masks on! - We got to go. - We got to go. Put your masks on. Go, go, go, go. Come on, let's go, come on, come on, come on. Get in the car! Well. We did it. God, you should have seen how she looked at me. Let her go? You can't just let her go, she's your daughter. You think this is what I want, Dad? - I got no choice? - Yes, you do. Signing that paper is your choice. If I fight this, I'm going to lose. You know how the courts work. What? I spend thousands of dollars on attorneys just so she can win anyway. She hasn't done anything bad enough to demonstrate that she's an unfit mother. Doesn't matter if I'm father of the year, if she wants custody, she's going to get it. Mace, you have always been a fighter. I remember the day you were born, looking at you through that hospital window. All hooked up to tubes. You came early, and they didn't think you were going to make it, but you did. Now this, this is something worth fighting for. Look, you two, I know I've said it 100 times, but it's going to be okay. Life has a way of working itself out. Why don't you sign the papers, give her some space. She can't keep her away from all of us. It isn't going to be easy. She'll get through it. How about those court fees, you need help? No, you need to save that for your treatment, okay? I appreciate it a lot, but I'll be okay. I just want to see you happy. I know. Well, that weather's coming around. Better get your pole ready, trout season's coming up. Are you coming with Thompson and I next week? Oh, come on now, he's planned the whole thing out. Just take Friday off. Well, he better pull those steaks off the fire. He's going to burn them. Well, that's one good thing about chemo. I don't have to worry about tasting Thompson's awful cooking. George, honey, can I get some help? I better go check on your mother. She can never change the batteries in them damn things. I swear she's going to break her leg one of these days. - Everything all right? - Oh, it's just the insurance, I don't want to talk about it. Now, what's for dessert? Excuse me, honey, got to put the knife away. - Stinker. - You're putting up with me, hmm? Silver lining to getting divorced? Tinder. You just push a few buttons and these girls just show up. Versal Baker's on it, he's getting all sorts of ting. He sends me these pictures late at night, when he's sleeping with them, feel like I'm right there. Dude, Versal Baker is a sex offender. - A what? - Yeah, he's a sex offender, - it's public record, man. - Okay, well, I don't buy it. Public record, I know the guy really well, okay, he's my best friend. We have matching tattoos. Oof, I love you, man, but you got to stop telling people you're friends with him. And probably get that tattoo removed. Yeah, that would explain a few things. You think you know somebody. God, Versal's a sex offender? Yep. How do you... What are you doing Googling these things? What do we do now? Ida, George's breathing has slowed down. Like we talked about. I think now is a good time to start calling your family. I'm going to start packing up, so I can leave you both in peace. Let me ask you something. How do you people live with yourselves? You just spent the last six weeks with my dad. The hell with insurance, he's a person, not a paycheck. My parents have always been the ones to do everything right. They paid their taxes, they voted. They went to church, they paid their ten percent. They taught their kids right from wrong. And you, what you're doing here, this is wrong. Oh, you don't think you're part of the problem? Yeah, they killed him six months ago, when they denied his coverage, but you're the cleanup crew. And who the fuck can afford all these exotic drugs anyway? You can believe whatever narrative you want to tell yourself, but at the end of the day, you crawl into the same bed. I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am, for all of this. Honestly, it is a tragedy that this is how it is. But I'm not the enemy. I didn't make the rules. Put yourself in my shoes. Imagine your job is to watch several people die every year. That you've gotten very close to. I didn't grow up dreaming to get paid to watch people wither away. But that's how it is. I hope you know that I've done the best that I can. This whole situation, it... it's not how it should be. I know that. But unfortunately, Ida, we have exhausted our options. I'm sorry. If you need anything, please let me know. I really am sorry. I'm really going to miss her. She was a lot of help around here, very kind to your father. You hungry? How's your dad doing? He just moans, all day and all night. He can't stop. Honestly, at this point I wish he would just go because he's in so much pain. But I feel bad saying that. How's my bike doing? Really, Thompson? I'm sorry, that was, um, that was fucked up. Uh, how much longer does he have? Who knows? Two days or two weeks. All I know is, I can't do a goddamn thing. You hear about those leaks? - Yeah, Medigate? - Yeah. After going through this shit with my old man, totally get why these people are doing it. People on that list are fucking terrorists. How are they terrorists? Think about it, we're spending billions of dollars hunting terrorists overseas. That kill, what, a couple hundred people, at the most? Meanwhile, we have these domestic terrorists in suits, killing thousands of people every year with zero accountability. And yeah, we pay them to do it. So, yeah, fucking terrorists. Sorry. No, I never thought of it that way. I think they're stupid. If was up to me, I'd make a point not to get caught. How's that? I mean... working in high-end security, I deal with all kinds of these assholes. We've installed security systems for a bunch of people on that list. I mean, you know what it's like going to these people's houses? Guiding you around, bragging about the shit that they have, rubbing it in your face. I mean, if I had one percent of what they had, I'd, I'd... I just... That's what I want. I mean, yeah, it would make things easier. Will's in second grade, and we're still paying off - medical expenses from his birth. - Oh, yeah. If I had that kind of money, I'd put our kid through college, take you on that vacation you wanted and still have enough to live on Easy Street forever. I mean, goddamn, I bust my ass every single fucking day and can barely keep my head above water. So yeah, fuck them. It's a disgusting display of opulence. Okay, let's calm down. I'm sorry, it's not right. Remember, we're not supposed to eat when we're stressed. So it'd be that easy? Just stroll in and kill someone? Yeah, I mean, pretty much. Okay, boys, no one is killing anyone. Here you go. - Oh, your name's Mason? - Yeah. That's my uncle's name, hmm. - Do you guys need anything else? - No. No, we're good, thanks. Okay, I'll get you more coffee. You got to slow down. No, man, it's gluten free. I can eat all I want, not feel all the guilt. She's got me trying all these new foods, to just kind of lose some weight, you know. Don't put this on me. He does this to himself, he's always thinking he's getting too big, so I just, I make some suggestions. I follow. I mean, this body ain't what it used to be in its glory days. What? Now? I'm on my way. - Mace. - Everything okay? I'm going to go with him, I'll see you at home. Hey, bud, could you get me a beer? Hey, bud, Mom told me what happened. - You want to talk about it? - Not really. Looks like you got one good hit in. Yeah. Wasn't really enough. I really don't feel like talking about this right now. Hey. I'm not going to lecture you. You stood up for yourself, I'm proud of you. Hello. - Bobbi. - Hey, Bobbi. - Hey. - Hey, man. Hi, Mason. How you holding up? I'm hanging in there. Is she ready? - She's good to go. - Yes! Ha-ha. - Built for speed. - Oh, it is beautiful. Well, don't thank me, thank Bobbi, she did most of it. Thank you, Bobbi, it looks great. I know. Now, look at that crankcase. That's USA built, not that crap from China. Mm-kay, well, I'm going to go and leave you guys to it. - I'll see you at home later? - Sounds good. Dinner's at seven. You're welcome to come. Bye, Bobbi, be careful on that thing. Love you. All right, look, Dickhead, I know you wanted to go cheap, but the QC standards in China just aren't what they are here in the States. And when your shift linkage breaks four times in a season, you're not saving money, are you? No, that makes sense. Right, and we've heard this about 100 times before, so how about today you spare us the details? Well, he has a habit of not listening, so I got to keep telling him. And didn't we talk about this the first time we met? Oh, yeah, we were at a bike show, and he ended up spending the whole day graciously telling me about, uh, how his bike was so much better than mine. Yeah, well, the day it sticks is the day we can stop talking about it. This is great, I feel like I'm in your sixth grade history class. Oh, no, if you were in my class, I'd only have to tell you guys once. Oh, is there going to be a pop quiz tomorrow morning, Mr. Garrett? What's with the sass? God. Hey. Let me ask you something. Shoot. Bobbi and I were talking about what we were talking about, you know, in the diner. Were you serious about that? About what? That disgusting display of opulence, accountability. Oh. Well, I mean, my bank account's still in the red, and after seeing your dad go through what my dad went through, it's kind of hard to say no. Wait, are you serious? Let's say we were real serious, how would we get in and out? Everybody already has their addresses, but you have the access. I've got a few ideas. Assuming we're all in on this, of course, we'd need alibis before anything else. If there's anything I've learned from stupid cop dramas... - Cop dramas? - Yeah, you never want everyone involved to have the same story. You got to split up. I mean, I've been watching CSI, CSI Miami, NCIS, all the shows. I've seen How to Get Away With Murder, How to be a Murderer. I don't know, I didn't pay attention. But I know this, okay? There's many, many shows that will teach you everything you need to know. And I've read some books. And I promise you, they explained it really well. I'm talking about making sure there's not semen floating around everywhere that they can get busted on. Yeah, I get it... I get that part of it. You said something about WWF and you lost me. - Yeah. - Just, whatever. I'm just saying, okay. Okay, like what, for example? Okay, we're going to need someplace we can get in and out of. Be seen, but not recognized, and be off the grid for a little bit, long enough to pull this off. I don't even know what that looks like. Well, assuming I was in on it, I could buy a ticket to a music festival, check in, set up a tent, get a wristband, take a few pictures and then ditch out after a couple shows. I would just have to make sure that I get back before the festival's over. Meet up with some people, go home, good to go. Damn, Murder She Wrote, how long you been planning that? I love it. What about you? Shit, I don't know, haven't thought about it much. Uh... Okay, I guess I'd, uh... I'd try to book a trip, say I was traveling. No, how's that going to work? How are you going to scan your boarding pass and not get on the plane? Not to mention the cameras. You'd be busted faster than a knife fight in a phone booth. Okay, use your noggin, you can do better than that. Okay, what if you and I go camping? We check in at the gate, meet some people on the trail, take some pictures, set up a tent. Take a shit or two. Take a shit , I like it. DNA at the alibi. Yeah, then we all meet up somewhere. Then as long as we're back Monday night in time to check out, we're in the clear. No one's the wiser. That's what I'm talking about. Okay, so we have our alibis, what do we do next? I mean, I'm not saying it's going to easy but it'd be pretty easy. Assuming we're all in on it, of course. I mean, do you know how many people on that list live in this state alone? I was at this guy's house all the time. Total dick, but... I installed his entire security system, from his front gate to his safe. So, all we got to do is sneak up, punch in some numbers, roll in old John Coyote, shoot the motherfucker and leave. Okay, well, what's the story on the safe, what's in it? Well, he's rich, he has a safe. I don't know what's in it, but I'd like to find out. So you just stroll in... shoot him, and get out, it's that easy. I mean, you don't want to be a total dumbass and leave anything behind like DNA, but you bring some ammonia, some bleach, you spray down the scene, and it basically just dilutes anything they would find anyways. I mean, look, guys, cops are dumb. It's not like on TV where they have all this fancy shit to catch you. Yeah, but if you kill somebody at the top of the food chain, they're going to look into it pretty hard. No shit, dickhead, but what I like about both your alibis is that they take place in areas that usually don't have cellphone service. If there's anything I've learned from 17 seasons of CSI, it's triangulation. That shit'll get you caught. So we get some burners in case we get in trouble, and we just turn ours off. - I am super impressed. - Thank you. Lastly, we're going to need some new wheels. We can't be seen driving around in ours, obviously, and we might want to tape up our license plate just in case we miss a camera. That way they just have a car description to go by. I can get us a car. So, can I assume we're all in on it? Thompson? Think about it. No more worrying about bills. No more worrying about not having health insurance. Do you know how long I've waited for this? To be a part of something big? Sure, going to protests are fun, you get to hang out with your friends, but nothing ever gets done. This is direct action. I know. And in theory it would work. This is fucking crazy. What am I supposed to do? I have a family. I... I just need to think about it. Hey, bud. Hi, Dad. Hey, hon. We're drowning in these bills. Internet, insurance, cell, gas, electric, groceries. I just walked through the door, can I have a... I know, but we've been dealing with this for years, and nothing is getting handled. Okay? we haven't touched our student loans in months. You know I want to get Will into a better school. He is so smart, and we're wasting all of this time doing nothing. And I'm working as much as I can, okay, I don't know what you want from me. I know, and I appreciate that, but it's not enough. For whatever reason, it isn't enough and we need to do something about that, okay? I'm here all day, every day, taking care of Will. He misses you. This is not what I signed up for, okay? Maybe we should revisit the idea of a second mortgage. No. I'll figure something out. You haven't figured it out yet. Okay, we need to do this together. Please? I love you, but this is just a mess. What are we going to do? Well? Mason and I are going to go camping this weekend. I think it'll be good for all of us. 1,300. Look, I built this bike myself. You won't find another one like it. Did all the fabrication and mods. Engine is bored out, front end is lowered, you got after-market suspension, new tires, new paint, can't go wrong. Come on, man, when was the last time you saw a bike like this roll through here? All you guys have here are a bunch of bicycles with lawnmower engines strapped to them. This is a real motorcycle. 1,300. 1,300? Come on, I built this bike with my dad. Exactly, it's overpriced. I don't make any money off memories. 1,300. Besides, you got no title, you'll want me to register it. Come on. What's the best price you could give me on it? 1,300. Hey. Yeah, um, I'm good. Can I swing by later? Yeah, no, um, I'm fine. I just... I need a favor. Yeah, okay. I'll see you then. Goddammit, Bobbi. You show up after three months of not hearing from you? It was really fucked up when all that went down, like. I'm sorry. I was just going through some shit, you know? I couldn't handle how fast it was moving. I missed you. Just trying to turn things around, you know? Still taking those, huh? You know what I'm like when I don't. Neither one of us wants to see that again. You still not tell anyone about it? I shouldn't have to. It's my thing, nobody else's. Can we talk about something else? Are you still taking classes? Yeah, no, not really. It's a lot of money to spend for a job that doesn't pay. Hmm, but you're so good. It's not like I want to, but my rent keeps on going up and I have bills to pay. We all have to grow up some time, right? I guess. But don't give up on it. Hey, where's Chomps? Shit, I never told you? - Yeah, he died. - What, how? - Heart attack. - Cats can have heart attacks? Yeah, I mean, they have hearts, so that's what the vet said. Damn. Well, anyway, about the car. What about it? Are you sure it's going to be clean? What do you mean clean? I just need a car for the weekend. It's a, a surprise. Just can't be mine. Okay, well, yeah, the whole lot's full. It's long-term parking, some haven't left in years. I drive them all the time. Just bring it back as it left, I don't see why it should be an issue. Yeah, of course. But if anything happens, I was never here, okay? Yeah, like when we were looting during the riots, right? The less I know the better. Yeah, just take the car. Like I said, you got to bring it back as it left. I can't lose my job, Bobbi. Yes, I got it. I miss this. Just a place where I could be. You could do it more if you want. I'm glad you came by. I'll see you next Tuesday. Oh, Jesus. Oh, oh, God. Did that really just happen, huh? Did we really just murder somebody back there? I'm an idiot, what am I doing here? You got to calm down, man. It's okay, we're going to be okay. We didn't leave anything behind. Nobody saw us go in or out. Okay? We're going to be okay. What are you doing, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah. I... I just killed that woman. - She didn't even do anything. - Yeah, she did. She called the cops, okay? - You did everything right. - This isn't right. - Accidents happen. - This is wrong. Okay, this is wrong what we just did. I can't breathe. - I'm starting to lose it, okay? - Look, you need to get a grip. I'm trying to get a grip, okay, but I need... I need like sugar or something. My body's crashing. Maybe at the next town we can just stop by a convenience store or something. Hey, mastermind, we can't just go in somewhere. We'll blow our alibis. No, I know how these things work, okay. As long as there's not a camera, no one's going to believe the testimony of some small-town toothless button pusher. We just, we'll be fine. We just got to go in and out, and not make any conversation. Okay, are you okay? Oh, yeah, you know. Just a little shaken up, we just murdered two people. If you're going to stop make it quick, got it? Yeah. Hey, Bobbi, you need anything? No. What do you want? This is a bad idea. It's fine. This place doesn't have any cameras. What are you looking for? Are you all right? Yeah, just lost my, um... sunglasses. Okay, they're just sunglasses. Relax a bit, keep an eye out, okay? You'll be quick, yeah? Yeah, piss, smokes, snacks, five minutes tops. Promise? Promise. Okay, you did everything you needed to do and you did it correctly? Yeah, man, relax, okay, we cleared our tracks. If there's one thing we did right, it's the setup. Everything about that scene says break-in. Don't touch anything you're not going to buy. And what the fuck, man? There was supposed to be money in that safe. - Not some science experiment. - Yeah, what was that, blood? Rich prick probably wanted to freeze his head like Walt Disney, fucker wanted to live forever. Instead he gets it blown off like Bambi. - It was Bambi's mom. - Whatever. And it wasn't really about the money for me, but it would have been nice to leave with something. Yeah, well, I didn't say that there was money. I said I thought there was money. And I need that money more than you. Raising a kid is fucking expensive, from the hospital bills to the food to the school to the lunch money to the toys that are supposed to keep him quiet and actually just make him louder. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. I don't even remember the last time I had a vacation. Natalie keeps wanting tickets to Florida. I can't even afford two bus tickets to Florida. Fuck Florida. I read this story about this guy who ate this other guy's face 'cause he was high on bath salts or something. Guess where he was from. - Florida? - Bingo. I'm just counting down the days till she realizes she could have it better with someone else. Okay, well, look, right now we just stick to the plan and pray it all works out. Yeah. So... - what's up with Bobbi? - What do you mean? I don't know, she's acting a little funny, don't you think? I think it's just catching up with her, with all of us. Okay, just, she'll be all right, just give her a chance to calm down. - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? - Doing all right. - Can't complain. I'll take one of those. I'm hungry. Hey. What are you doing? Just looking for the registration. Want to make sure we have it. Oh, found it. Get back in the car. See? Funny. Shut up. Seriously, though, how you doing? Not that you'd tell me anyway. I just, um, can't stop thinking about her. Her eyes. Her lifeless body just... laying there. I've never killed anybody either, I get it. But you got to know we're doing this for the right reasons. That's what I keep telling myself. I feel so bad for her. Wrong place, wrong time. She just fell, hit her head. You know she stared at me right in the eyes when she died? The right reasons? You didn't see her face. I just blew a guy's off. He doesn't even have a face. We're in this together. I just keep thinking about when this is all over, getting on my bike and riding till the tires go bald. Never looking back. You almost done? It's getting there. Yeah, there it is. Ah. You know I love him, but he is an idiot. I know. We wouldn't have been able to do this without him though, right? I guess. - Good to go. - Are you sure? Maybe we could get a proper meal up here. If it's safe to eat. Yeah, I could use some actual food. - Yeah, me too, I'm starving. - Great. Well, who wants to go in when we get there? Me, I would really love to get out of this car. All right, well, just make sure you take those glasses off. - Yeah, give them back to Elton John. - Ha-ha. My dad and I used to stop and get Mexican food. We came back from our fishing trips. I always remember how he'd open them, little salsa packets. He, he used his teeth, and he'd just go at it like a badger and he'd be like. It just made me laugh. Which in retrospect's probably why he did it. Hearing a kid laugh is just about the only thing they do that isn't annoying. Yeah, it's the best part of being a teacher. Every day, I secretly hope one of those kids gets into some shit, so I can get a good laugh and, and send them down to Mrs. Markovich's office. I got in trouble so much they were thinking about building a second desk in the principal's office. Doesn't surprise me. What'd your mom think of that? She was pissed. She was always pissed. No nonsense. She always made it about her. How I was like, embarrassing her. My dad, he didn't care. He was hilarious. He used to sing these Christmas songs, just obnoxiously loud when we were in public to embarrass us. Eventually I learned just to start singing along with him so we could be obnoxious together. Damn. ♪ Jingle bells ♪ I wish I could have met him. He was larger than life. Even as he got sicker and sicker, my mom was... she was always pissed. Probably just sad as shit that her husband was dying of cancer. But the old man would just laugh and crack jokes, chase me around. Towards the end it got a little morbid. When they look like that, you know, before they go. Yeah, and that's the version you remember. Yeah. Them at their worst. Seeing somebody off as they die. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. Seems a little hypocritical given the morning we had, but sure. That's so fucked up. At least you got to know them. I never knew my parents. What, what are you talking about? They gave me up when I was a baby. I went from one foster home to another. And then adopted at seven. I used to watch these strangers walk in and out every day... hoping one of them was my ticket out of there. I'd wonder, what's he like? What's she like? What's their house look like? Am I going to have brothers and sisters? Making up all these possibilities every time somebody walked in that door. But all you get out of it... you just watch your friends, the only people in this world that you connect to, leave. And you never see them again. Fuck this. Dude, I had no idea she was adopted. What the fuck? It's best to let it be, man. She's been in a bit of a weird place since rehab. How are you holding up, with your dad and all this? Clearly I'm doing pretty well. Just. So good. Got it together. No, though, seriously... I never thanked you... for all you've done for me and my folks. Means a lot. Yeah, man. You're family. Actually, I'm not hungry anymore. We got some miles to make up. I'm always hungry. Do what have you. All right, this silence is killing me. You guys want to play I Spy or something? What are you, four? Pops used to play it with me on the way back from fishing. Okay, fine, yeah, anything to keep my mind off watching that guy's head explode on repeat. Okay. Uh, I spy with my little eye... something yellow. Uh, the dry grass. No. - Bobbi's jacket? - Ah, yes. I spy with my little eye... something, uh, red. Uh... the glasses. - Yeah. - Yeah! All right, Bobbi, you're up. You want me to teach you how to play? I spy with my little eye, something... black and white. Fuck. Oh. Shit. I got to tell you something. What? I got the car from Clyde. - Who's Clyde? - Clyde? Why would the fuck would you bring Clyde in on this? - Who's Clyde? - Guaranteed it's stolen. Why didn't you tell me where this car was from? It didn't matter. He said the car was clean. He has a whole lot full of cars, it checked out. And also, fuck you. Do you know what I had to do to get this car? You know, it's not like we could have just walked in somewhere, bought something and put our names on it. This was the best option that we had. Yeah, well, either way, none of our names are on the registration. Okay, look, he's coming, just, just chill. Fuck. Good day, Officer. You all know why I pulled you over? Actually, I don't. Well, you have tape covering your license plate. Any idea why that is? No. Tape? That's news to me. - I... - Well, either way, I'm going to have to see your license, registration and proof of insurance. Yeah, okay, sure. You all sit tight. You gave him your license? Great, we might as well just go out there - and shoot ourselves in front of him. - No, we can just drive. - Okay, Mason, just drive. - I'm not going to drive, I'm not going to drive. We won't get 100 yards in this car. All right, never mind, I got this. No, no, no, no, no! So, Officer. I'm sorry. What are we going to do? Huh? Now we'll all calm down. I know, I know. I'm going to use good judgment. I haven't lost my temper in 40 years, but Pilgrim, you caused a lot of trouble this morning. Might of got somebody killed. And somebody ought to belt you in the mouth. Is that John Wayne? Now you understand. Anything goes wrong, anything at all, your fault, my fault, nobody's fault. It don't matter. I'm going to blow your head off, simple as that. Bobbi, Bobbi please, Bobbi, please, Bobbi, no! My name's under bill of sale. Ma'am, get back in the vehicle. Hey, I got this. Ma'am, get back in the car. What the fuck, Bobbi? What were you going to do? Talk your way out of getting your license back from him? Talk your way out of having him not radio in where we are and who we are? Doesn't add up. Somebody had to do something. So, don't be pissed at me for saving your ass. Both your asses. Is he dead? Well, he's not sleeping. What are we going to do? We can't just leave him here. Just to clarify, that's an off-white AMC Eagle Wagon, late '70s, early '80s, is that correct? Over. Yeah. Well, that's it! Don't worry, I can sound enough like him. You can sound enough like him? You know why I pulled you over? License and registration. See? I, I, I just, I just need to know what to say. Well, anything's better than nothing. Stan, do you copy? This is Stan, over. Everything okay? Everything's fine. Just headed back to the station. Just had a stop and go. A stop and go? Over. Stan, do you need me to send... Now your fingerprints are all over the walkie. Stan? No, no, stop, stop, just, just stop. We got to make a decision. We got a body and a car, do we take it or do we dump it? Okay, are the keys in the car? Well, yeah, he did just drive here. Uh, okay. - I got an idea. - Okay, well, it better be a good one 'cause we got to get the hell out of here, fast. Hope this buys us a little bit of time. Yeah, assuming nobody comes out here. Sure is nice out here. I can't remember the last time I was out this way. You know, sometimes God just gets it right. Okay, we got to get out of this car and into something else fast. I imagine every cop out here is going to be looking for us. Where we going to find a car, man? We're in the middle of nowhere. I know a place. It's not far from here. I used to go when I was a teenager. Lots of kids go there. It's real nice, especially on a clear night like tonight. You can just throw out a blanket, lay in the field, look at the stars. And boys say those things to you that make you feel like... you matter. Can I ask you something? Yeah, of course. What is this? Like, this is good for now, but... what happens in September? We don't have to break up. Just because school's out doesn't mean we have to end things. We can get a place together. It's going to work out. I just want to be happy. So do I. Hey, what's that going to take? Well... I mean, I don't need a huge house or a nice car. I would really love to just have a nice, little junk shop. You know? Like, where I sell antiques that I've hunted down. Secondhand stores, you know, if you do all the shopping, you can sell the stuff for a lot of money and, I mean, who knows? Maybe it'll be a coffee shop too and... I, I don't know, I just always thought that'd be fun. I think it sounds like a great idea. I can help out around the shop. We can get an awesome place. You know I make a mean cup of coffee. Yeah, but aren't you afraid? You know? That we'll just end up two different people? No, not at all. Listen... if we can be together... we can go together. You know how much I love you, right? I love you too. But your coffee is not that good. - Hello? - Hello? - Darrell? - Hands up. - What? - I said put your hands up, don't move. All right, good. Now I'm going to take your van, because I need it. No, you can't. You can't take the van, it's not mine. My dad will kill me. It doesn't matter. This is a matter of need versus want. Tie her up. - What? - Tie her up, tight. Go to the rope and tie her up! Feet and hands. It's freezing out here. We're 20 miles from town. No one's going to be coming out this way. Fill another bottle up. Set the bottle... What? No. Look, lady, you can have the van. But how about you give us a ride first? Yeah? Okay. Keep your hands up, turn around. And back up slowly. Miss, she's in a dress. It's been getting real cold out here at night. The coyotes, she could be eaten alive, you know. Better yet. What if we take you home? Where do you have to go? We have a full tank of gas, we could... take you wherever you have to be. And then no one gets in trouble. This is will all be just some crazy story, you know? Kid, I'm taking your van. This time tomorrow, I'll be in another vehicle. The cops will be delivering your van to your dad's house, and it will be another crazy story. What's your deal, lady, you off your meds or something? - Yeah. - All right, let's not get... He moved. I can't believe that, what an idiot. I mean, who does that? That changes everything. Now what am I going to do? Think, think, think, think, think, think. Safety on, safety off. Safety on, safety off. I'm sorry. You actually look really pretty tonight. I remember what it was like to be your age. It's a lot of work. Where do I look when I aim? Like this, Papa? Okay, now keep your eyes where the barrel's pointed. Only aim your gun at something you're going to shoot. - Okay, like this? - Mm-hmm, steady, sweetheart. And remember, don't pull, squeeze. Miss? I just want to go home. Me too. I don't want to talk about it... but I think we should talk about it. What's that? You think she killed more people? Does it matter? Yeah, it matters, Mason. Because I guarantee those people weren't on the list, and that cop wasn't on that list. What are we doing this for, huh? Yeah, it matters. It's a means to an end. I need to make a phone call. Hand me a phone. No, I don't want you talking and driving. It's dangerous and illegal. Hand me a phone. Thank you. Hello, hey, Ma, how's everything going at the house? Mm-hmm. Yeah, anybody stop by for me? Good. Yeah, I'm just tired. She's fine, she's just sleeping. Yeah. Hey, honey, it's me. Uh, just checking in, I'm sure you guys are at church. I just want to say I love you, uh. Trip's been pretty interesting so far. Uh, how are things going with the house? Bet you're getting it all ready for your mom. I love you guys, and I'm excited to see you, and maybe we can get some Mexican food... That's not the fucking burner, you fucking idiot! Hey, hey hey, hey! Cut it out, stop! Out of the car! - Go! - Okay, Jesus. Move! Keep walking, go! What have you done? I'm sorry. Hey, let's all just calm down a bit, right now, okay, we don't need to be falling apart. No, fuck that. He just fucked us. Please, Bobbi, it was an honest mistake, okay? I grabbed the wrong phone, they look alike. Yeah, Bobbi, we'll, we'll figure it out. Okay, it was a mistake. We're all tired. Just put that down, okay, we'll, we'll figure it out. Fuck you. You worthless son of a bitch, I'm going to blow your goddamn head off! I have a family, okay, they need me. I don't give a shit who needs you. It's not going down like this, okay? Just put it down. We'll get back in the van, and we'll worry about what we need to do next. Don't make me do this. You think this is what Dad would have wanted? Oh, good job, Bobbi, that's my girl. But we always got to put the safety on. All right, Bobbi, let's see how your brother does. Come on, Mace, show her how to do it. Okay, now you take a deep breath. - All right. - Aim, take a breath, let it out. And squeeze. Oh. Ah, it's all right, Mace, you'll get it next time. No, Bobbi, please! No, Bobbi, please don't! Don't, stop, stop. Just stop, stop. No, no, come on, we got to get you to the hospital. You'll die if you don't get there. Stop, I can't go to a hospital. We both know that. Well, what... What do you want me to do? I don't know. Just... finish me off. No, I'm not going to just finish you off. You better toss that idea right now. Then give me a gun and I'll do it myself. How are you going to shoot yourself? You already have a bullet hole in your shoulder. What, what are the cops going to think? And plus, and it feels like you can't do it, you see? I mean, it doesn't really reach around, and you can't have it through here. Do you want to not be an asshole right now? I'm sorry, there's just a lot going on. I can't go to a hospital. Well... Fuck! Just listen, listen. I have to tell you something. What? I lost my pills. What pills? It doesn't matter. What matters is, um, I don't have them anymore. So what? We'll get you new pills. There's got to be a pharmacy around here. No, Mason, you don't understand. I lost the bottle at the house in Brier. Now what am I going to... So she lost her pill bottle, what's the big deal? What's on a pill bottle? I don't know, a lid? No, dumbass! Her name and address. It doesn't matter, I don't care. I'm not leaving you here, end of story. Think about it, Mason. It's all on me now. No, it'll be okay. Come on, we'll find... we'll think of something. We'll think of something. Just, just take me so I can watch the sunrise. Sh, sh, sh, no. No. Sh, sh, sh, sh. Oh, fuck. Okay, sh, sh, sh, come on, come here, come on, come on. Come on. You'll get used to it the more you do it. Do you know why my first mommy left me? Well, that... It wasn't 'cause she didn't love you. It's just... Our family was the best thing for you at the time. Yeah, you're a pretty good big brother. Thank you. You're not going to leave me, are you? No. Promise? Promise. This is shit. This whole thing is shit. Last Thursday, I was at my house. Having dinner with my family. Laying on my bed, fucking my wife. She probably hated it, but I probably loved it. And now I'm going to have to get used to seeing my son once a week, if he finds it convenient to drive down to the state penitentiary and learn to love his father through glass. And how long is that going to last, huh? I'm sure by now some cop has found Bobbi's pill bottle. And what do we do from there? I bet there are cops sitting in your mom's living room. Right now. And that means that this whole entire thing depends on her acting. I hope Graham County Community College had a stellar acting program. I think we're going to be okay. Do you think this is going to work? It has to work. Just try it. Oh, geez. They were both gone for the weekend. Mace was on a camping trip with his friend. I... - Keep going. - Okay. It has to be believable. Okay, I think they checked in Friday morning. I'm sure you can find them out there. You know, she went to the... Bobbi went to the music festival at the Gorge. The one where all the kids like to go to these days. That's really good, Mom. Just don't say the part about the kids. It doesn't sound real. Bobbi went to the music festival at the Gorge. She checked in on Friday, too, I think. She doesn't call me that much. I don't hear from her as often as I'd like. I don't hear from her as often as I'd like. We believe your daughter stole a gun from this home. So she's out there, armed and possibly dangerous. We need to find her, Ida. Do you have any idea where Bobbi might be? She must be at the concert. She sent me these pictures. I'm sure she's still there. And what about these pills? Pills, what kind of pills are those? Well, according to this bottle, it's lithium. Lithium. What, what for, what do you take lithium for? Ida, I don't know. What I know is that we need to find your daughter. Well... If she's out there sick or hurt, she... she must need her medication. Maybe someone stole her pills. That's it, maybe she's the victim here. She's at the concert. You should start there. - We should start there. - Ida, you need to stay here. Now, I promise you, we're doing everything we can to find your daughter. If you see or hear anything from her... you call me. Okay? You'll let me know when you find her, right? Of course. Answer, answer, answer, Bobbi. I'm out, Mace. I'm out. I want to go home. And I want to see my family and I want to see my son. Okay, nobody knows anything about this. So just take me home. If that's what you want. Thompson, I'm sorry everything went to shit. I hope you know none of this is on you. Go in. Do what you got to do. If you're not back here in five minutes... I'll understand. But Monday's closing in. And I can't stop now. Inside was a horrific scene. Our own Kevin Curtin spoke with him. When I saw the door was open, I knew I... - Honey? - Hey. Why are you home so early? Look at you, geez, take your boots off. Uh. We went hiking around the trailhead, and I slipped and fell into a ravine. I'm fine, but then we got to the campground and... Mace realized he forgot the stupid tent, so. We just packed up and came back early. That's a bummer. Oh, other than that, how was it? It was something. I bet it was, I mean, you haven't been hiking in years. Bet you were just having the best time. Did you bring enough snacks? Oh, yeah. Speaking of snacks, you must be so hungry. - I'm going to make you something. - I'm fine, it's okay. Oh, just give me a minute. I'm... I'm making you something. I'll take questions at this time. Given the extenuating circumstances of this case and Mr. Winston's connection to... Oh, yeah, that's from the bank. They denied our request for the loan. What kind of question is that? Of course it doesn't. My job is not to judge this man's life. Okay, we are trying to find a killer, or killers, we don't know yet. And last I checked, Mrs. Winston wasn't named in those documents, so, no, this does not lower this case's priority. We treat all cases like this with the utmost importance. Next. You noted that the security system was disabled, does that narrow your list of suspects? Uh, yes, that is something we are looking into. - Any other leads? - Nothing that can be discussed at the moment. Okay, I'll take one more question. Baby? What's wrong? Baby, listen. It's okay. God's got a plan for us. Don't worry. I didn't go out and start breaking the law. So, personally, I feel like we're dealing with criminals. And as police officers, we're here... Where's Will? Oh, he's over at the neighbor's house. They were getting Chinese food. You should have seen them, they were out front playing all day, bleeding that hose dry. You know, I tried to make them some lemonade, but for some damn reason, they just love the hose. A friend of Michael and Molly Winston. Jason, are you there? Uh, yep, I'm here. How are you holding up? We're all pretty upset over here. See the news at all? No, anything good? Just this poor couple over in Brier, they were murdered. They think it has something to do with the whole Medigate thing. Jesus, Brier is close to home. Yeah. They, uh... they catch anybody? Mm-mm, not yet. He was a businessman, and he didn't break any laws. You know, I want to feel bad but it's kind of hard. It's karma, right? I'm going to save this for later. Honey, don't forget that my mother's coming back next weekend, so we got to clean up around here and get ready for her, okay? With a chance of some late-summer thunderstorms on Monday, highs in the 80s for Spokane, Pascoe, Tri-Cities, while Bellingham, Mount Vernon and Seattle all remain in the 70s. As we head into Monday, it looks like we've got a bit of a low-pressure front coming in. Baby, what is going on with you? I know that I have been letting things slip around here... but things are going to be different, okay? I promise you. I promise you. There better be some goddamn money at that next place. You made the right choice. Fuck you, Sam Brock. Huh.
