It's beautiful, isn't it? It's gorgeous. Juliana Piranzi-- last year's design, but still a classic. It would be a dream to walk down the aisle in a dress like that. Mm-hmm. So when is your wedding? Oh, no, no, I'm not getting married. But I'm guessing you are? Next Valentine's Day. Oh, congratulations! Mm. You know, there's a new guide book out for planning a wedding. Have you ever read Tying the Knot? No, but I probably should. It's right there in the window. It's only been out a few weeks. It has everything you'd ever need to know about weddings. Wow, thanks for the tip. But how do you know that if you're not getting married? I created Tying the Knot. Can I get a signed copy? I'd be honored! Ohh! Ho! Jill, I found our winners. I'm so sorry, did I wake you? Yes, I'm still at the office. Go back to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow morning and fill you in. Okay, bye. Morning. Hello! I'm dying to know-- who is the lucky couple? I can't wait to tell you. Amy Price and Scott Bishop of New Hampshire. Good morning, everyone. Their story is so touching and heartwarming. Amy is in grad school. Scott is in the military. -A few years ago, Scott was wounded in Afghanistan and broke off their engagement. He didn't want to be a burden to Amy. But... she wouldn't give up on him, and two years later, they're engaged again. Ohh! Well, we definitely have to give them a wedding they won't forget. Yes. And one that will make every other bride want to click on our website. And buy the book. And buy the book, yes. Sales have been a little sluggish. Ah, well, sluggish isn't terrible. Ever the optimist. I need to work on being more like that. In the meantime, I'm going to email you the lucky couple's contact info, and could you please set up a conference call with them? Yes, of course. Thank you. I'm still, like, in a state of disbelief. Well, you'd better start believing, because this is really happening. And it's not gonna cost us anything? Not a single penny. All we need from you is a date for the wedding. Well... okay, we-we know it's short notice, but, um... we just found out that Scott's being transferred to Germany earlier than we thought. Oh. So... we'd like to be married next month. Next month? We can make that happen. We sure can. Uh, have you had a chance to look at the book or the website? Where are we having this wedding? Vermont. "The Wedding Cottage" in Stony Bridge. Oh... it's so charming. It's-It's, um... it's where my parents and my grandparents both got married. I love that! Carrying on family traditions. All right. Well... we have a lot to do, so we will report back soon. Okay. Um... okay, bye! Thank you. Thank you so much! Bye! Well, we definitely surprised them. They weren't the only ones who were surprised. We have five weeks! Do I need to remind you we once moved an entire wedding in two days from Cancun to Hawaii, to avoid a hurricane? Do they have hurricanes in Vermont? Uh, not this time of year. At least, I don't think so. Have you seen this? Amy and Scott posted about the contest on a military couples website, and it's blowing up. So I linked it to our website, and we already have over 5,000 views... Oh, no. You have your "we've got a problem" face on. What's wrong? The Wedding Cottage is what's wrong. They've disconnected their phone line and all of my emails have bounced back. What? How is that even possible? I don't know. I just got off the phone with the third business in Stony Bridge, and they all said the same thing-- the Wedding Cottage is closed. Since when? Since they haven't updated their website in five years. This is all my fault. I was in such a rush to submit everything, that I didn't double-check what the research team compiled, I just let it go. Did you find anything else out? Like why the cottage closed? Not really. Everyone I talked to was so suspicious of me. They all thought I was this real-estate developer. But I did find out one thing-- the owner of the cottage is still there. So what do we do? So we pretend like nothing's wrong, and I head to Vermont. Okay. That is fantastic, Ted! Thank you so much. Hey. Evan. Great news! I just got off the phone with Ted Miller. He offered you a spot in the next Collective Show. The one that's coming up next month? Yeah. Like it does every year. Did he offer you the spot, or-or did you have to talk him into it? Evan, you know how plum these spots are. You haven't shown in a while. I mean, I had to do a bit of a song and dance, but he wants you, and that's something. Well, what would be something is if I actually had a piece to show. Well, I thought that's why you went up to Vermont in the first place-- to change the scenery, get your creative juices flowing again? That was the idea, but... Look, I know you can't force inspiration, but maybe you could... shove it a little bit? It is the Manhattan Collective Show. And I would be a fool not to jump on it. I-I get it. Right. So is that a yes? Yeah. I will try to come up with one piece to show. That's right. One piece is all we need. You've been up there for months, you must have something brewing. Not even a cup of coffee. Hello? Is anyone home? Can I help you? Oh, you scared the heck out of me! Are you lost or something? I... am not sure. I'm trying to find the Stony Bridge Wedding Cottage. Yeah, this is it. No, no, it can't be. This doesn't look anything like the photos in the guide book. What guide book? It doesn't matter, but this isn't what it's supposed to look like. Okay, well, I can't really help you with that, but if you're a real estate agent, I'm sorry, I'm not interested in selling. I'm not a real-estate agent. Okay, then what do you want? I want to have a wedding here. Oh. Well, then, I'm sorry to disappoint you and your fiancĂ©, but you're about five years too late. It's not my wedding. I work in the wedding business. I publish a wedding guide book called Tying The Knot. Maybe you've heard of it? Okay, never mind. Okay. My grandparents are the ones who used to run the Wedding Cottage, but they passed some years ago. I'm so sorry. Perhaps I could have a peek inside? Maybe it's not as bad in there as it is out here. You don't seem to be getting it. There is no more "Wedding Cottage". Mm, technically, that's not true, because it's still listed in our guide book. Okay, let me put this a little more clearly-- the Wedding Cottage is permanently closed. You understand? I mean, I... I understand. I'm just not happy about it. Well... Where are you going? You should also probably take us out of your guide book. Do-- Do you live here? I don't live in the cottage. I live... I live back there, but that's not really any of your business. Of course not. Wow! Well... I made it to Stony Bridge, and the people here are very charming. Are you at the cottage? What's going on? See for yourself... I'm texting you a photo. Oh... Pretty sad, isn't it? Well, maybe it's not as bad as it looks? Oh, no, no, no, it is. Have you seen the inside? No, I haven't, because the owner wouldn't let me. He's kind of a grouch... but I've dealt with grouches before. So, in the meantime, could you please look for another place nearby that looks the way this place used to? That's a joke... right? Oh, it is a desperate attempt at one. Bye. Hi! It's just me again. Sorry to bother you. I don't think that you are. What would you like? I'm really busy. Okay, then I will cut to the chase. I am in a terrible bind, because I just promised the winners of a nationwide contest that they could have the wedding of their dreams... here. She's in grad school. He's in the Army. They'll be shipping off soon. So, please, I am begging you... do not deny them their dreams. I'm not denying them anything. I don't have a clue what you're talking about. I am proposing that you let me fix up the Wedding Cottage. I walked around the property. I took peek inside, and, really, all it needs is a little TLC. Okay-- ...a lot of TLC, but, really, all it would take is some cosmetic work to make it beautiful again. I'll do all of the work at my own expense. It's basically a win-win for both of us, because you can move out of this place, if you want, and back into the main house. So... what do you think? Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can-- I'm not interested. So you may as well really leave this time. Any chance you'll reconsider? I am considering calling the Sheriff. Okay, you made your point. I'm really leaving this time! Hi. Sorry to interrupt, I just need a room for one. Sure. How long will you be staying? I don't know. It could be a while. Yet to be determined. No problem. We're not too busy these days. You here on business? I hope to be. Have you heard of the Wedding Cottage? Of course. But it's been closed for a while. Yes, I just found that out the hard way. Um, credit card? -You can tap there. -Okay. Do you happen to know the guy who's been living there? Mm. Not well. He pretty much keeps to himself. I knew his grandmother quite well, though. Rose Stanford. She kept the cottage open until her health began to fail. Well, apparently her grandson has no interest in carrying on the torch. Probably not. I hear he's some kind of artist. Pretty ironic. An artist has no interest in preserving the beauty of the cottage? It'd break Rose's heart if she saw the state it was in now. Do you know if he's done any work on the property since he moved in? You're not a developer or real-estate agent, are you? No, absolutely not a developer. Um, though that seems to be on everyone's mind these days, doesn't it? Most of us in Stony Bridge prefer to keep the town just as it is. Right. Come on, I'll show you to your room. Here we are. I hope you'll be comfortable. It's perfect. Thank you. Hi! Hi. I realize we didn't get off to a good start yesterday, so I thought I'd come by and re-introduce myself. I'm Vanessa Doyle. And I believe you are Evan Stanford, right? What did you do? Did you sleep in your car? No! No, of course not. I-I stayed at the B&B. Oh, and did you know that the owner of the B&B, Marilyn Sherwood, was very good friends with your grandmother? I'm sure many people were. My grandmother grew up here. These are for you. What is that? A... peace offering? Oh, you mean a bribe? No! It's just coffee and a cinnamon bun. Homemade at the B&B. Well, thank you, but if you don't mind, I think I'm just gonna head on into town, and I'm gonna get my own coffee with no strings attached. Uh, you can keep this either way. "Either way"? I just need two minutes of your time. I'm gonna save you the two minutes, because the answer's still no. Okay, do you have something against all weddings, or is it just something about the Wedding Cottage? Actually, I have nothing against either one of those things. Okay. So why don't you just say yes as a tribute to your grandparents? It would only take a few weeks for me to spruce up the cottage, and it's just one wedding, and then-- and then, I will be out of your life forever. Ooh, kinda wish you were out of my life right now. Yeah, I'm getting that sense, and I'm sorry. I realize I'm being a bit of a pest, but I do not give up easily. Really? Okay. Marilyn-- she showed me some photos of what this place looked like in its heyday. Yeah It was magical! And it deserves to be brought back to life. And... And you-- as an artist, more than most-- should really appreciate that. Okay. Listen. I-- I don't disagree with you. Okay? But I came here for two things. For some peace and quiet, and to do some work. And fixing up the Wedding Cottage doesn't sound like either of those things. Okay, now we're communicating. So, what if I... what if I personally supervise the crew, and make sure that you are not disturbed by any noise at all, whatsoever? You're shaking your head. Okay. And-And I would bring you coffee every day! -No. -And... And I will oil your bicycle chain, uh, once a week. And... and-and I will walk your dog. I don't have a dog. Okay. Well, I recommend getting one. They're excellent companions. -I don't want a dog. -Okay. Well, the point is, I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this work. Yeah, okay, I understand. I get it. My answer's still no. No, no! Okay, okay. This wouldn't just be for you and your grandparents. This would be for the-- for the whole town! Don't tell Marilyn I told you this, but she could really use the extra business. And I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but... that very sweet, young military couple has their hearts set on getting married here. The bride's parents got married at this cottage, her grandparents got married at this cottage. So, really, all of this is just steeped in tradition! That's a good speech. Thank you. A little over-the-top, but I meant every word. Are you really this desperate? Yes. Because the future of my business depends on it. Well, I can certainly understand that feeling. I'm sorry, I'm not normally so... excitable. Let's hope not. So do we have a deal? You really want to do all of this just for one wedding? It's worth it for one wedding. That sounds exactly like something my grandmother would've said. So is that a yes? Yeah. Okay, fine, we have a deal. Oh! Oh, my goodness! Oh! Oh, thank you so much. I'm sorry, I should shake-- Okay. Forgetting something? A... hug? No, my morning coffee. Oh! Of course. You don't have to bow. Yes! How about you? How are the wedding plans coming? Good. I spoke with Amy and Scott. They have decided on a "rustic country" theme. Yellow and orange for their colors, and classic rock for the music. Oh, that's nice. And how about publicity? Any luck getting them booked on Good Day, America? Uh, I used all my connections, but I've hit a brick wall. I guess hiring a publicist is out of the question. Oh, we are already over-budget. Right. Well, I'll try to call in a few favors. And let's hope they owe you big-time. Hey! You're supposed to be the optimist. All right, I'm at my next stop. I'll talk to you later. Hi. Hi, there. -Hi. -How can I help ya? Uh, I'm Vanessa Doyle. I'm gonna be doing a little renovation over at the Wedding Cottage on Stony Lane. Do you know it? Sure. I got married there. Great! That's so nice. Um, I will be needing a painter, someone to handle carpentry... uh, an electrician to check the wiring and lighting. What's your time frame? Four weeks. Okay, I could make it four and a half, if I need to stretch it. What's your rush? You do know this is Vermont, not New York? Which is where I'm assuming you're from? Too pushy? A little. People in Vermont are a little more laid-back. We don't usually like to rush. Right. Well, I need to have a wedding there in five weeks, so, any suggestions? Well, um... postpone the wedding? Okay, I'm guessing that's not an option. No. The groom is in the Army. He'll be overseas by the end of the month. Hmm. Well... the best contractor around here is, uh, Daryl Froelich, but he's usually pretty booked. Oh. Um, but you know what? I bet if you explain to him your situation, he'd probably help you out. He's ex-military himself, so... let me give you his number. Thank you so much. How's it coming? So much better than expected! I called over a dozen local vendors and not a single one put me on hold. That just doesn't happen in New York. Did you know that the Wedding Cottage is one of the oldest establishments in Stony Bridge? Well, at least, it used to be. I knew it was old, but I don't know much about its history. Oh! Well... Rose's parents spent their honeymoon there in the 1920s, and then they decided to buy it because it reminded them of an English country cottage. Mm! The story goes that they were so happy there that they decided to turn it into a wedding venue so that other couples could experience what they had. Mm, it's really a shame I can't keep it in the guide book. That story would be great to include. Mm, it was quite the place in its time. People came from all over to get married there. It even had a slogan-- "Where happily-ever-after happens." I read that on the sign. And did it prove to be true? It did for me. Although I... I lost my husband a few years ago. I'm so sorry. But... everyone else I know that got married there is still together. Wow. So, no one in the family wanted to carry on the business? No. And so, when Rose passed, they just closed it up. And, as you know, she left it to her grandson. Right. Who doesn't seem to care about it at all. No, but at least he hasn't tried to sell it, so... I was wondering about that. Mm. Maybe he does have some affection for it, after all. Thank you. Thanks. This is just a coincidence, isn't it? Of course it is. All right, I'm just checking. Are you dining alone? I was planning to. Well, since we are both here alone, would you care to join me? No strings attached. Honest. I'll have to take your word for that. You know, if you like fish, the trout here's amazing. Oh? You come here often? Two or three times. Since you've been in town? Two or three times a week. You must really love trout. Vanessa! Neil! Good to see you again. You too. Uh, do you know Evan Stanford? -Oh. Hi. -Hi. This is Neil. He owns the hardware store. Did you manage to get in touch with Daryl? I did, yes. Thank you so much. He's sending a crew tomorrow. And you were right-- he was very sympathetic to the cause. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Enjoy your dinner. Thank you. Daryl is the contractor I hired. He was on another job, but he was eager to help. Although, the rest of his crew was busy, so I contacted an electrician in Bennington, and, hopefully, he'll be here by the end of the week. You got all that done in one day? Mm-hmm. It's kinda my job. Didn't you tell me that you were a publisher? No. Yeah... I used to plan weddings, but I gave it up to start my new business, Tying the Knot. Although, I guess, technically, I'm still planning Amy and Scott's wedding. You must really like weddings. I do. I love weddings. I'm surprised you don't, considering you're practically living in theWedding Cottage. It's like I told you before-- I have nothing against them, it's just not the business that I wanted to go into. Right. So you became an artist. That's right. And how is your work going? Yeah, it's, uh... it's-it's coming along. You can end it right there. That far? Yeah, you can end it right there. -Perfect, thanks. -I'm so sorry. So sorry. Do you think you could ask your guys to just keep it down? You can't really do this kind of work without making a little bit of noise. Come on. Why are we whispering? Because I kinda promised the owner of the property, who happens to live in that back cottage, that we wouldn't make any noise. The cottage that's 100 yards away, on the other side of the pond? He can't hear us. We're gonna have to lose all that paper. You don't have it in the budget for new wallpaper, so, what we're gonna do is we're gonna peel off this old stuff and put on a new coat of paint. Sounds like a plan. Watch your step. Oh, no... it's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. Oh, boy. Hmm! Okay... Shh, shh, shh, shh! Ooh! Um... What are you doing with that thing? I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. I, uh... I don't know how to turn it off. -Thank you. I can't get a gardener here until next week, so I thought I'd try to clean up a bit. You ever used a leaf blower before? No, but I... It can't be that hard. Well, it can be a very dangerous piece of machinery if you don't know what you're doing. All right, I should probably show you how to use it. No, I don't want to interrupt your... work. I was just doing some sketching. Um... and, besides, I would not like to see you lose control and break a window or something. Okay. Well, I mean, I would gladly accept a lesson if you have the time. I can spare a few more minutes. First off, it doesn't go on the ground. It goes on your back. Oh. See? All right, here. Okay-- Oh. -Yeah. -Thank you. That's pretty heavy. You sure you got it? Yeah. I got this. -You sure? -Absolutely. I got it. Oh! Whoa! Thank you. Okay. And you're gonna want to put these on. Oh, no, I don't need-- Yep! Okay... Okay, and I just... Oh, ho, ho, ho! You want to slow down-- I can't hear you! You want to slow down... ...and just go nice and easy. Okay? Take it slow. Okay, going slow is not a thing I'm particularly good at. Yeah, I've noticed! You're kinda hurrying around all the time. So I'm told. I'm working on it. You should, 'cause, otherwise, you're liable to miss out on a whole bunch of great things, like... the smell of fresh-cut grass, or... you know, the way leaves change at the end of the season. Or someone trying to work quietly sitting on a bench. Sorry. I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't even know you were there. Yeah, see what I mean? Okay, you got it now? You're good. Okay... nice and slow! Nice and slow. No, no, you want to go-- You want to go-- What are you doing? You don't jump! You don't jump, you just go-- okay, you don't... No, no, no! Sorry! Okay, everyone, lunch is ready! Oh, wow. Looks like you're cooking for a small army. Uh, just a small group of hard workers with healthy appetites. -You want a plate? -Sure. Okay. Um... I actually got all of the food at that restaurant where we had dinner together. I-I meant where we bumped into each other. Yeah. Oh, that's good. I know! That's really good. Yeah. I just hired them to be the caterers for the wedding. I should probably get this next time instead of the trout. Oh, no! No! What is this? -What's wrong? I don't know. There's some kind of leak here and I don't have a plumber here today. Okay, uh, just give me a second here. I can have a look. I'll just get the shut-off valve. Okay, I can take care of this. Just give me a minute. Oh... okay. Thank-- Thank you so much. So do you moonlight as a plumber? No, I use these tools in my work. To paint? No, I'm a sculptor. I work with metal. Oh. I knew you were an artist, I just didn't know what kind. Okay, so I've fixed it temporarily. Uh, it's like a Band-aid. So if you want to use the sink, you're gonna need to get a real plumber. Okay. Thank you so much. Um... I think you earned yourself a second helping. Okay. Yeah, okay. I booked the local deejay, so all that leaves is the cake. Oh, did I tell you about the near disaster we almost had at the cottage? No. What happened there? Well, a pipe in the kitchen sprung a leak. But luckily, Evan was there. He's a sculptor, so he had all the equipment he needed to patch it up. How lucky was that? Wait a minute. What did you say Evan's last name is again? Stanford. Why? Because he's famous! Oh, he is? Well, yes, in the art world. And how do you know that? You remember the guy I dated last year? The really pretentious one who was into art? Yeah, the one whose name we're never supposed to mention again? Yeah, no, and we're not. Anyway, he took me to Evan's last gallery show and I really liked his work. It was very intense. Yeah, that was my first impression of him. But he's... mellowed a bit. You know, I never actually met him, but from what I remember, he is very attractive. Jill... I'm gonna stop you right there. You can forget all about that. We are just here for work. There is nothing wrong with mixing work and romance. You met at a wedding cottage, after all. How romantic is that? It's not. You've seen the state of things here. Yeah, but look at how far it's come in just two weeks. Well, it'll all be for nothing if we don't pull this wedding off. Has there been any progress on your end withGood Day, America? Maybe. Uh, the first wedding I ever did was for a friend who knows one of the producers, so I reached out to them, and I'm waiting on a call back. Well, fingers crossed. And toes. Oh, I spoke with Amy. She has decided on wildflowers for the wedding. That's what I was gonna suggest! It goes perfectly with their theme. I will get on it. Anything else? Yeah. Find out if Evan is single. Goodbye. Bye! Marilyn, do you know the best place around here to find wildflowers? Uh... probably the woods behind the cottage. Oh, that's convenient. Just watch out for moose. Moose? It's their mating season. Well, hopefully, I'm not their type. Oh! Ah! Ow! Hey-hey-hey-hey! Sorry! Watch where you're swinging that thing! It's just me! I thought you were a moose! Do I look like a moose? No! But you never know. Look, I'm out here a lot and I've never come across one-- at least not yet. Well, at least it looks like you're starting to finally slow down and enjoy the local scenery. Oh, it's not a exactly a leisurely stroll. This is really more of a work thing. I'm just collecting ideas to show the florist for the wedding. Isn't that just doing the florist's job for them? Well, I... I want the wedding to be perfect. Especially since it's likely the last one I'll be planning. Yeah, why is that? You seem to really love doing them. I do. But now I have Tying the Knot, and... ...and after 234 weddings-- including both my sisters, all of my friends, and my parents' vow-renewal-- it just seemed like time to try something new. That's a lot of weddings. Yeah, but none of them were mine, which is becoming a bit depressing. I can't believe I just said that. Ah, probably needed to be said. Yeah, but I've never said it out loud, let alone to someone who's practically a stranger. This is pretty embarrassing. Well, it's just me and the trees out here... I mean, maybe a moose... so your secret is safe with us. Can I ask you, though? How come none of the weddings were yours? I've always been a perfectionist in my professional life, and that bled into my personal life as well. I set the bar so high, no one could really reach it, so none of my relationships lasted. Well, at least you figured it out. True. Although, launching this new business hasn't really left time for anything else. So I guess that's just an excuse. Anyway, enough about me. Have you ever been married before? Just once. Didn't last. I'm sorry. Was she also an artist? Heh! No, far from it. She didn't really like the art world that much... or my art... just the status that came along with it. Well, that must have been hurtful. You know what? It wasn't entirely her fault. I used to get completely consumed by my work. I can relate. Now I understand slowing things down... taking the long walks. It's the Vermont way. Well, maybe there's more to Vermont than just maple syrup. Are you sitting down? Well, I am driving to New Hampshire to go see Amy, so, yes, I am. What's up? We got the booking for Good Day, America. They just called! Oh, my gosh, that's fantastic news. Well, whatever you said to them, it got them to our website and they loved it. Hopefully, this will turn things around for us. It will. You were right, Vanessa. This is the one. You look beautiful! I feel like a princess. Oh, my goodness. Did you know... ...that the tradition of wearing a white gown was started by Queen Victoria? Really? Mm-hmm. She decided to forgo the practice of wearing the coronation robes in favor of something a little more modern. You just, like... know everything about weddings, don't you? Sometimes, a little too much. I'm just... grateful... to, like, have you helping me through all this. Especially since my parents are gone and I don't really have anyone else. You mentioned your grandfather will be walking you down the aisle? Yes. And he and my grandma can't wait to see the cottage again, by the way. Oh, yes. It is... It's quite the place. Yeah, Scott and I can't wait to see it in person! Great! I want to, like, twirl... Hello? Vanessa, it's Daryl. I'm at the cottage. We've... got a situation. Oh, great. Well, you were right. There is a family of raccoons living in the attic. So what are we gonna do? Nothing until we get somebody from Fish and Wildlife out here to remove 'em. They figure they can get somebody here in about two days. Two days? And in the meantime? Well, in the meantime... we can't start on the electrics, because all the wiring is in the attic. Okay, let me just get this straight. The wedding could be postponed on account of a family of raccoons? In the attic. Roland, I know the show is only two weeks away. Don't you have anything that I can look at? Text me a photo, a preliminary sketch. Just anything so that I can get the word out. I'm just not ready to show it yet, but as soon as I am, you'll be the first to know. All right. As long as we can't start the wiring, I thought we could start the painting. Oh! I almost forgot. These... are a gift from my wife. A thank-you for all of the lunches. They are her maple-pecan blondies. Oh, my goodness, they smell delicious. Oh, they are. People come from all over just for those. Mm! Right? Does she do wedding cakes? I don't know. -You'll ask her. -Mm-hmm. Evan? Evan? Wow. Looking for something? That is the third time you've startled me. It's not my fault you seem to be in places that you shouldn't be. Oh, I'm sorry. Your door was open. You know, if I didn't know any better, I would swear that my art dealer sent you here to spy on me. I can assure you, I am not here to spy on you. I came to deliver these delicious maple-pecan blondies, and you will thank me after you taste them. Oh. Now will you please tell me why you think your art dealer is spying on you? Uh, because he is worried that I will not finish my piece on time. Is he right? Maybe. I have to say, I find it hard to believe that someone with your talent could be so creatively blocked. I... I Googled you. I think you're really talented! I've never seen anything like your sculptures before. They're meant to represent the urban landscape-- the consequences of living in a steel jungle. I could see that. I-I think you definitely captured New York City. Yeah, but that was... that was then, and I'm just-- I am... I'm so tired of being the young, angry artist who's just railing against the establishment. I'm... ...trying to see things from a new perspective. Well, what about your paintings? I mean, this is nothing like the urban landscape. These are like the landscape here. That's because they are. But... I'm not the artist who painted them. My grandmother was. They're really good. It was just her hobby. Her passion was the cottage, and she filled it with all of her art. Did she sculpt, too? No, that is mine. I forgot all about that. I made that my first year of art school. I-I got it from a piece of wood that I found on one of my walks. Hmm. I really love it. Yeah? I should go. I have... raccoons to feed. Okay. Well, thank you for feeding me. You're welcome. It's fine. They're releasing them into the forest. They-- They'll be good. I'm gonna go in, seal it up, make sure they don't come back. You weren't kidding about the raccoons. No. Why would I kid? That's not even funny. -Sorry. No, no. No-no-no. What's wrong? The bride and groom are on their way to Stony Bridge. They want to come see the cottage. Well, that's okay. It's starting to come together. I can't let them see it like this. Why? Because I wasn't exactly truthful with them. I didn't have the heart to tell them that not only was their dream cottage closed for business, it was also looking more like a nightmare than a dream. -No offense. -Oh, none taken. Actually, I think it's pretty nice that you're trying to protect them. Thank you. I just need to find a way to keep them away from here, and fast. Maybe I can help. I'm a bit of an expert in the art of stalling. It's kind of a wild idea, but it might work, and I think I can get some other folks to pitch in. Oh! That would be such a lifesaver. -I'll see what I can do. -Okay. How did you ever come up with this idea, anyway? Uh, actually, it was all Evan. Evan, like Rose's grandson, Evan? Mm-hmm. Hmm. I didn't know you two had gotten so close. He's just being helpful. Hmm. Did I happen to mention that, before I opened the B&B, I had a dance studio? I don't think so... but I think I know where you're going with this. I'm sorry if we just sprung this on you at the last minute. Oh, no, it's no problem at all. Yeah, we thought since, um, Scott managed to get the day off from the base, and I didn't have any classes today, so... it was the perfect day to come see the cottage. -Yes. -Yeah. And, actually, I'm really glad you're both here, because there are still a lot of decisions to be made. And who better to make them than you two... in person! And then, once those are all out of the way, then we can go see the cottage. Sound good? -Yeah. -Yeah. Great. Hi, Nadine! Hi. This is Amy and Scott, the winners of the Tying The Knot wedding contest. It's nice to meet you both. -Nice to meet you. -Hi. I know you're pressed for time, so I arranged just a small tasting session. Come on. -Okay. -After you. Wow! Have a seat. That is a lot of cake. And you have to try every one. -Okay. -Okay. Fun. This is cookies and cream. This one is traditional chocolate. Mm! Do you want to try the espresso? You look like an espresso. Let's try this. This one is carrot cake. -Autumn spice. -Autumn spice. -Chocolate caramel. -Chocolate caramel. Next up, we have the florist. Okay, so, next, I was thinking we could get some lunch. There's a great little restaurant right around the corner from here. I'm still full from all the cake. So, not even... a light salad or... a soup? No. But thank you. The day's going a little faster than we thought. Uh... maybe we just go see the Wedding Cottage now? We have a 5:00 train back, so we don't want to cut it too close. Right. Well, there's really just one quick stop we have left to make. It's... It's a part of the contest, and I was saving it as a surprise. Well... -Okay, let's go! So... this is where your guests will be staying. Oh, wow. Huh. It's our song. Amy, Scott... I'd like you to meet Marilyn... Hi. ...the owner of this fabulous B&B, and also a professional dance instructor. Tying The Knotwould like to offer you both a complimentary wedding dance lesson. I don't think that's a good idea, not with my bum leg. Oh, Scott, I am so sorry, I should have run this by you first. No, Vanessa, it's okay. I mean, even though Scott has a prosthetic leg, we still go hiking and rock climbing. Like, we do all sorts of activities, so. Dancing just isn't one of them. Well, we-we did talk about maybe having a first dance at the wedding. And you said you would try. And we do have an instructor here. All right. But I'm not promising anything. You're going to circle each other. Eye contact. That's it. A little playful, a little sexy... Now a little twirl in. That's it. And sway. -Okay, like this? -Yeah. And then pull her in. There you go. Support her arm here. Move her with the pressure of your hand, yeah. How's it going? Good. Everything is going according to plan. -What about you? -Ready to go. Oh... Sorry I'm so bad at this. Don't be sorry. We'll get there. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to introduce Evan. He is the owner of the Wedding Cottage. -Hi. -Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. Nice to meet you. You two want to try it again? Um... I'm not sure it'll do us any good. Well, I have an idea. Um... I don't know if Evan remembers this, but I used to teach dance to all the kids in town, so, maybe if he and Vanessa wouldn't mind demonstrating? I think it might help Scott and Amy. I do remember those lessons, and although I am a little rusty... I'm game if Vanessa is. I am also a little rusty... but happy to give it a shot. So, you two ready to give it another try? Let's do this. Bring her in nice and close. That's it. You all right? Um... just give me a minute. You know, give me a second. I'm... I'm gonna talk to him. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. Look, I'm not gonna pretend to know what you're going through, because I don't. But one thing that I do know about is overcoming your fears. The funny thing is... I was never scared in combat. But, right now, I am afraid of letting Amy down. Well, I am pretty sure that Amy would just be happy to have your arms wrapped around her. You're already her hero. Come on. You're right. Good job! Yeah! I am so sorry. I hate to leave, but I have to go. Um, I just remembered I have this conference call with my office, but Evan is going to drive you to the cottage. Okay! Well, thank you for today, Vanessa. It was-- It was... It was wonderful. I'll see you two soon. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, would the two of you like to see anything else before we head out there? I could show you our famous covered bridges. No. No, we're-- we're just really excited to see the cottage. At your service! Oh, no. I didn't know this was out. Okay, we're gonna have to take the long way around, might add another half hour or so. I-I didn't realize it was that far from town. Do you think we'll get back to town in time to catch our train? Depends. What time does your train leave? Five o'clock. Ooh, that might be cutting it close. I have to be back at the base at 20:00 hours, so we have to catch the 5:00. Scott, maybe we should skip seeing the cottage. Just head back. Unfortunately, I think that she's right. To Operation Distraction. I really don't know how to thank you. You're the mad genius behind it all. I was just happy to help. Mad genius, huh? Yeah. But in a... a cute way. What I mean is, you did all of this just so that Scott and Amy wouldn't have their wedding dreams dashed. Not many people would do that. I think you're giving me too much credit. I don't know. Just a couple of weeks ago, you were begging me to let you fix up the Wedding Cottage, and now it's almost ready for business. I guess a lot can happen in a couple weeks. Mm-hmm. When we first met... I thought you were a grouchy recluse. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Well, I'm still a bit of a recluse, but maybe a little less of a grump... thanks to you. And you're giving me too much credit again. Would you rather I just go back to being a grouch? No! I like the new Evan better. So do I. Looks like you've had an effect on both me and the Wedding Cottage. And when did you join the crew? I'm just pitching in. We're running a little behind on account of the family of raccoons. Ah, yes... speaking of raccoons, there's something I need to show you. Uh-oh. Around back, if you will. So we're just finishing up on the attic and the roof back there, but that big, old tree is growing right in, and it's just gonna lift up all the work that we just finished, if we don't trim it. That's fine by me. It's not your permission I need. Oh. There's no way that I'm letting anyone cut this tree. I don't want to cut it down, I just want to trim it. The tree is almost 100 years old. All the more reason to trim it. Now, look, I gave you permission to work on the cottage, not the trees. Okay. Well, why don't we just put a pin in the tree for now, because there are other things I'm concerned about. Like, for example, those columns I found on the side of the house-- I'd like to move them to the front, but one of them is broken. So do you think you could replace it? Uh, those columns are custom pieces. You don't have time for that. Oh. That's disappointing, because they were gonna be the first thing everyone saw when they came in the door. I'll have a look at the columns, but, to be frank... this tree's a much bigger problem. What's the story with the tree? There's no story. Okay? It's... it's history. My grandparents planted this tree when they opened up the cottage. I'm not usually sentimental about these sort of things, but... I really like this tree. I like everything about it. I like the way that the light reflects off of it at the end of the day. Okay. So you see this tree as a piece of art? Yeah. I do. Well... this piece of art is growing into your cottage. Okay. Fine. I will give you permission to let them trim it, but they have to treat this like a piece of art. Just a little. I promise. -Thank you. -All right. You'll see they left as much as they could while getting it off the house. See? We only trimmed a little. Mm-hmm. Think you can leave that one for me? I think I'd like to keep it. Sure, no problem. Good job. What's all this? I fixed the column. I can see that! How did you do this? I made it. Okay, but this is-- this is a perfect match. It's not perfect. I'm not a finish carpenter, but I think it's close enough. Evan, thank you. Is this why you wanted to save that piece of branch out back? I didn't use that, but I used it as inspiration. Well, I really appreciate it. Um, Amy and Scott are gonna be on Good Day, America in a few minutes, and I was wondering if you wanted to watch with me. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I do have a vested interested in them. Okay. This morning, we are talking with Amy Price and Staff Sergeant Scott Bishop, who are the winners of a contest sponsored by a new guide book and website calledTying The Knot: A Guide To The Perfect Wedding. The prize is the wedding of their dreams. So, tell us, what is that dream wedding going to be? Well, um, we chose a beautiful wedding cottage in Stony Bridge, Vermont. Okay. So you're about to have your dream wedding, but I think people would also like to know how you two first met. You do it. Okay, okay. Um... it was a blind date. Only I mistakenly went up to the wrong girl. Me! But she turned out to be the right girl in the end, and I fell in love with her on that first date. Well, it has certainly been a pleasure meeting you both and hearing your love story. Thank you! Um, w-would it be okay if we just gave a quick shout-out to the people in Stony Bridge? Sure, go for it. Okay. We'd like to thank the ladies at the floral shop, uh, Marilyn at the bed & breakfast, Evan, who owns the Wedding Cottage, and of course, Vanessa and Jill from Tying The Knot. And we can't forget Nadine's Vermont Bakery-- they're making our cake. Yes! You know, they are sweet kids. Yeah, I know. I don't think I could've picked a better couple. And this should be a big boost for your business. Yeah, I hope so. Well, how could it not be, with you at the helm? You are an extraordinary person, even if you are a little... A little bit of a pest? I was gonna say "tenacious". Oh. Well, it got me this far, didn't it? So what's next? So, I am going to go back to New York. Mm-hmm. And, you know, we always said that if Tying The Knot was a success, we'd get started on the European version of the book, so... so I guess I'll do that. What about you? I think I'm gonna stick around for a little while. I finally had a breakthrough. That's so great! Yeah. Okay. All right. So... no more tic-tac-toe? You saw that? I did. Well, you know, I never win anyways. Yeah. I think you might be doing it wrong. You're not supposed to play alone. Maybe I just haven't found the right partner. Have you given up looking for a partner? I wasn't really looking for one at all. And then, one day, someone knocked on my door looking for the Wedding Cottage. And ruined all your peace and quiet. Yeah. Just in time. I should probably, uh, get back to work. You know, now that I'm all inspired. Okay. Well, um... thank you for... all-all of your help on the column. I know Daryl will be very impressed. You know that I wasn't trying to impress Daryl. Hello? Good news! I just got off the phone with Top Trends Magazine, and they want to come out there today and do a piece on you and the wedding. That's incredible! -I know! -And I have some good news for you-- Um, Evan agreed to live streaming the wedding. Well, that is quite a turnaround. Not really. Turns out he's quite the romantic at heart. Hi. Just dropping these off and then I'll go. Oh, no, you don't have to rush off. I don't want to bother you while you're working. I don't mind being bothered by you. Plus, I should at least say good morning. Mm. And thank you so much for the coffee. I really appreciate it. I've been up half the night working. Well, that sounds good. So good that I called my art dealer and I told him that I was gonna be ready for the show. That's fantastic! Can I get a little... sneak peek? It's not quite ready yet. I understand. -I get it. -Okay. See you later. Yeah. Would you like to have dinner tonight? I'd love that. And that got me interested in learning about other cultures' wedding traditions, and then, one thing led to another, and it... it just sort of morphed into a business. So then, what inspired you to transition to the guide book? Well, after years of compiling information and resources about all things wedding-related, I just sort of thought, "Why not put it all in one source?" Both in print and online. You can... I got it. One last question. What's your idea of the perfect wedding? Uh... well, this may sound a little biased, but, for me, the ideal wedding would be... at a place exactly like this. Where everyone finds their "happily ever after"? I saw the sign. Okay! Yes. Yes. Happily ever after. How you doing, Daryl? Hey. Hey, was that by chance Evan Stanford? Uh-huh. What's he doing around here? Oh, he owns the place. He owns the Wedding Cottage? Yeah. Lives here, too. Can't wait! -With a boutonniere. -Oh, no! Hey there, you two. -Hi! -Daryl tells me that Top Trends Magazine was at the cottage today and they're doing a cover story on you. Oh, no, it's not a cover story, it's really just a small profile piece. Well, either way, it's still exciting. Enjoy your evenings. Thanks. Why didn't you tell me those two were dating? I had no idea till just now. It's true. Wow, it's a beautiful night. How about I walk you home? I don't know... it's a long way to Tribeca. You live in Tribeca? I live in Tribeca! No! Yeah. I'm on Walker St. I'm on Reade! Come on. Wow! We had to come all the way to Vermont to meet. It kinda makes me like Vermont even more. So are you still planning on sticking around here for a while? Yeah, I was going to, but... I don't know. Now I'm starting to think that maybe I should split my time between here and New York. Although, I do have to go to New York in a couple of days, since my piece is almost finally finished. I wish I could come see your show. Yeah. But I will be here getting ready for the wedding. Yeah. You know you're invited, right? And I intend on coming. Do you want to come in for a nightcap? As much as I would love to... ...I think I should head back to the studio, 'cause I just really want to finish my sculpture tonight. That's okay. Okay. Um... so I will see you first thing tomorrow morning then-- bright and early, with coffee. I look forward to it every day. The "seeing you" part, not the coffee. Right. Yeah, because that would be weird. The coffee is not that good. Yeah, it's not... Goodnight. Hey. Listen, before you say anything, I just finished the sculpture, but, I have to warn you, it's-- it's not like anything I've ever done before. That's not why I'm calling. I've been getting calls and texts about you all morning. Really? Why? Well, it seems that Top Trends Magazine is doing a story saying that you are down and out... uh, running a wedding cottage in Vermont with someone named Vanessa Doyle. I had no idea things were so desperate. If you needed money, all you had to do was ask. Whoa, whoa, just back up a second. First off, I don't need any money, and I am up here working. I'm not running the wedding cottage-- Vanessa is. And who is Vanessa? It's a bit of a long story, but she's this girl that I started seeing. I don't understand how my name even got out there, let alone part of a story that's so blatantly false. Well, they must have had a reporter up there digging around. They've even got a photograph of you on your bike. Yeah, there was someone here doing a story about Vanessa, but I never talked to them. Well, it sounds like she did. This is-- This is all starting to make sense. It is? Yeah. She's obviously using your name to help out with her business. No. No, I-- I can't see her doing something like that. But face the facts. Yeah, she's recently opened a new business. You said yourself you only started dating, and she's using your name as publicity. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of publicity we need when we're trying to reboot your career. Hi. Hey. Good to see you. Mm-hmm. You look like you're all packed. Yeah. It's about time I should head over to New York. Oh. I didn't realize you were leaving so soon. Yeah. Does that mean you finished your piece? I did. That's wonderful. Can I get a little sneak peek before you go? Why? Do you want to take a picture and show it to the journalist? Well, I would-- I would gladly do that for you. So, Top Trends Magazine... the article came out. Seems to be the talk of the town. Already? Wow. Yeah, "wow". That was my reaction. Congratulations. Thanks. I hope this was all worth it for you. It was. Um... I, uh... I should really be heading back, okay? Okay, sure. Um... Yeah. I brought you your coffee. Thanks. Safe travels. Okay. Jill, this is such a mess. I thought Evan was talking about the story the reporter did on me and the wedding. I had no idea there was a story about him, too, and now Evan somehow thinks this is all my fault. I'm guessing you already tried calling him? And texting and emailing. He's just gone silent. Well, it is a long drive from New York. Maybe he's being a responsible driver and not looking at his phone. What if he never wants to speak to me again? This is all just a misunderstanding. Why didn't he just ask me about the reporter? He was angry, and probably not thinking rationally. I think I should just go back to New York and try to explain it to him in person. Oh, but the wedding is three days away, and we still have a hundred things left to do. I know, but-- I get it. You fell for him. I mean, I was the one who encouraged you from the start. Maybe he just needs some time. Maybe. Or maybe it just... isn't meant to be. But Amy and Scott are meant to be, so... so I'm just gonna forget about all of this and... do my best to focus on their perfect wedding. You're right. This is... nothing like you've ever done before. I think this is one of your best pieces of work. It's exceptional! Oh, ho. I am so relieved to hear you say that, and-and I have to be honest, as soon as I started working with wood again, it just... it felt like a step in the right direction. I guess hiding out in Vermont was exactly what I needed. Well, looking at this piece, I don't think it was Vermont-- I think it was the girl. I mean, she might have had a hidden agenda, but she was certainly an inspiration. What are you calling the piece? I don't know. I don't have a title for it yet. The caterers should be here by noon, so if you could just get the cake here around one, that would be great. And-And Amy decided to go with the traditional wedding topper. Okay. Thanks, Nadine. Bye. That's it. We're done. Oh, my goodness. Everything looks amazing. You and your guys went above and beyond. Well, like I said when you hired me-- military guys take care of each other. Well, thank you again. We should settle up. Already taken care of. What do you mean? I didn't pay you yet. Evan did... a few days before he left. Why would he do that? I asked him the same thing myself. He said he's really starting to love the place. Might even stay on, and it only made sense for him to pay for it, being that he owns it. Okay, but that's not right. You-Your contract is with me. Yeah, it wouldn't be right to get paid twice either. No. I-I just don't understand what's happening here. Why wouldn't he just talk to me first? I think he wanted it to be a surprise. Ah, he's just full of surprises. Good surprises. Ah, talk to him about it when he gets back. Pretty sure he's not coming back. These are some of the best reviews of your career. Congratulations, Evan. I wasn't sure I'd ever get there again. Get there? You're on top again. And offers for commissions are rolling in. Well, without your constant nagging, I probably never would've finished this piece, so, thank you for never giving up on me. You're welcome. I'm gonna keep nagging you until you get back up to Vermont and start working again. Uh, I'm actually not gonna be going back to Vermont. I've got a perfectly good studio here in New York. Great. Keep you close to home. Let me sell some of your art. Oh, sorry. Evan. What can I do for you? Hey. Uh, I've decided that I'm not gonna be coming back to Vermont, so could you just do me a favor and close up the cottage after the wedding? Really? After all the work we did? No, your-- your work is fine. You did an excellent job. I just... I don't belong at the cottage anymore. Oh, that's too bad. Guess I spoke too soon when I told that gal you were living at the cottage, huh? Wait, what gal? You know, the one that came to interview Vanessa. You were the one who told her that I was living there? Yeah, she saw you on your bike and he asked me about ya. Rose's paintings are a nice touch. They deserve to be hanging here again. They're really charming. I can see where Evan gets his talent from. I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring him up. That's fine. After all, we are standing in his cottage. Yeah, it's just too bad that this place isn't gonna stay open for business. I mean, you did such a spectacular job fixing it up. It really is the perfect wedding cottage. Well, sadly, it's the swan song for the cottage, and the swan song for me. This is my 235th and final wedding. That's a shame, too. What do you mean? It's just... you shine every time you plan a wedding. And there is no one who does it better than you do. Thank you. That means a lot. But this will give me more time to focus on the website. Why? It's practically running itself. And thanks to the contest, Tying The Knot is a bona fide hit. Mm. That may be true. Despite all of the chaos, and close calls and... a little conniving... this wedding has been fun to plan. Well, who says you have to choose one over the other? You look like the perfect bride. How do you feel? Nervous... but excited at the same time. Is that possible? Oh, it's so normal. That's how most brides feel on their wedding day. You have your something old? My grandmother's locket. Something new? My hair clip. Something borrowed? Thank you, Vanessa, for lending me your bracelet. And something blue? My mother's sapphires. Then I think you are ready to walk down the aisle. -You look beautiful. -Thank you. Scott, what-- what's wrong? I can't remember the moves. Okay. Um... What are you doing here? I told you I intended on being here. Scott... just follow our lead, and don't look at anyone except for Amy. -You know, this is the fourth time you've taken me by surprise. Mm-hmm. Well, don't be surprised if it happens again. Especially tonight. What else do you have in store? To start with... ...an apology. I now know that the magazine article didn't come from you. I'm glad we worked that out. I'm so sorry for running out the way that I did. I never should've doubted you. I hope you can forgive me. How could I not? You just saved their first dance. Well, you saved the Wedding Cottage. It was worth it. This place is magical. Well, I know my grandparents would agree, especially since it brought us together. I'm sorry, did I... -...did I mishear you? Come on! It sounded like you said we're together? Is that too big of an assumption? Not as far as I'm concerned. Okay. I just wanted to clear that up, too. Come here. There's something I want to show you. Evan... this is your new piece. It's amazing. It's... earthy and warm, and romantic... It's just like you. And I love it. That makes it all worthwhile. So what's it doing here? I thought it was supposed to be in a show in New York. It was. But then I... I just realized I couldn't bring myself to sell it. Because it belongs here. So do I. Does that mean you're going to reopen the Wedding Cottage? Well, you know, I would need a partner for that. Do you know anyone out there that likes weddings? I don't. Tch. But I do know someone who loves them. Oh. Well, is she available? Hmm. She might be. Yeah? And she is going to have an incredible new story to add to the next edition of her guide book. Oh, you mean the entry that was never supposed to be there in the first place? -Yeah. -Yeah. It's really funny how things work out. There's always a happily-ever-after at the Wedding Cottage.
