[melodic music] [music continues] [music continues] [female #1] Taxi, taxi. [male narrator] I cannot believe that life can be more generous than it was to me when I was a young writer living in New York City and in love with a girl named Janet. [typewriter keys clacking] Janet was from Iowa. Now an editor at a fashion magazine. She was convinced that when I was working I'd forget to eat. [doorbell rings] - Is that you? - It's me. [knock on door] I bought you corn beef on rye with potato salad. You said you'd rather have potato salad than coleslaw. - Thank you. - I thought I'd never get a cab. There's a slight mist falling out there. - You know how it gets. - Mmm, yes, I know. Oh, Aunt Flo invited us to tea tomorrow. Okay. Why is it so dark in here? Janet. Sit down. John, I'm on a deadline tonight. I gotta get back to the office. Oh. You really are an odd person even for a writer. [slow music] Thank you for the corn beef on rye. Thank you for remembering the potato salad. And thank you for coming into my life. You're welcome. I never thought I'd get married. I used to think my work was so important and so demanding that it could take the place of a wife and a family. That night you walked into the Algonquin for dinner. I turned to the people I was with and I said.. ...that's the woman I'm gonna marry. You're awfully sure of yourself, aren't you, Mr. Walton? Janet, you proposed to me back on Walton's Mountain but I never really proposed to you. I love you, Janet, and I'm asking you to marry me. I'd like that very much, John-Boy. Why don't you call me John? [birds chirping] [keys clacking] Corabeth, I think we're gonna have to buy a new cash register. Corabeth, I said I think we're gonna have to buy a new cash register. And I think we're gonna have to also buy a hearing aid to stick in your ear so I won't have to yell! For God's sake, please. I am in the throes of creation. Now, what on Earth is it now? I was trying to get your attention. How's the book coming? Mr. Godsey, I am inspired. The news of John-Boy's wedding has positively energized my muse. [bell rings] Oh, good morning, Mr. Godsey. 'Well, good morning, ladies.' Good morning, Ike. And how are you, Corabeth? Well, you'll have to forgive, Corabeth. She sent away for one of those correspondence courses that teaches you how to write a romance novel. Oh. 'So, what can I do for you, ladies?' Well, we need just oodles of sugar. Uh, how many, Miss Emily? How many, what? How many oodles? Oh, several. - Wouldn't you say, sister? - Oh, indeed, yes. And we also need some yeast. The kind we usually order. Ah, something tells me you ladies are mixing up a batch of the recipe. We're making a special run for John-Boy's wedding. We are personally transporting the recipe to New York and to John-Boy and his friend. Sister's already started practicing driving the automobile and I'm going to navigate. Well, it isn't all that difficult. One simply gets out to Route 29 and heads north. Sister, you remember the time we drove to New York with papa? Was that the time we were stopped by the law enforcement officers, sister? 'Remember papa gave him some of the recipe' and he tore up the speeding ticket? I have no recollection of that, sister. Oh. [Mamie] 'That will be all, Mr. Godsey.' Well, fine. I'll send that all over this afternoon. And how will you ladies be taking care of the bill? We had a notice from the bank that we've run out of money and so I'll have to mail you a check. Well, that'll be fine. Isn't that right, Corabeth? - Bye bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Godsey. "She knew not what to say, save Oh, my Pierre. Dear Pierre." '"They sailed for Europe on an ocean liner.' "On the deck, as he embraced her "his pectoral muscles touched her "sending multiple electrical shock waves through her ample bosoms." [bell rings] [instrumental music] [dog barking] - Morning, Drew. - Good morning, John. Thought you fellas might want some coffee. You've been out here since the crack of dawn. Well, we have another big order to get out. You and Drew have done a good job running the mill. Now that the election's over, I'll be able to help out again. It'll be good to have you back, daddy. Yeah, it sure will. Especially with this big contract we got coming up. - You tell your dad yet? - Madison Development. They're planning to build a big subdivision here in Jefferson County. I talked them into getting all their lumber from us. I wish you'd talked that over with me first, Ben. I'm not sure we can handle a big order like that. Don't know if we have the tools or the manpower. Manpower is no problem, Johners. Men all over the county looking for work. You know that new mill that folded in Rockfish? I got a great price on their equipment. I bought out the whole place. So how you figurin' on paying for it? We've made a down payment. They're gonna take a percentage of profits from Madison until they're paid. It's foolproof. I don't know how you figured that. The county's gotta vote on this development first. It's good for the county, it'll go through. Besides, you're on the board of supervisors. I hope I'm hearing you wrong, son. If it's good for the county, I'll probably vote for it. But we can't stake our business on how I vote. No, you better get on the phone and cancel all that fancy equipment. I can't do that. We're locked into it. Look, it's a good deal, John. I knew when I put you in charge you were gonna take some risks. I didn't think you'd put us out like this. - Daddy, it's a sure thing. - Didn't I teach you anything? This business is built on common sense and hard work. There's no such thing as a sure thing. Get the paperwork on this deal, now. Bring it inside. Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. John. Hello. Janet tells me you're from Virginia. That's right. My family's been living up in the Blue Ridge Mountain since the early 1700s. Well, one of my very best husbands came from Virginia. I just adore Virginians. Well, I'll take that as a recommendation. Now, I probably will become a pain in the neck as time goes by. Janet is the daughter I never had. She comes from a distinguished family as, of course, you know. Please sit. And since her mother is not here to arrange things for her I have to do it. Well, all we want, Aunt Flo, is your moral support. Oh, my dear. Of course, you have that. That's all, Dean. Thank you. It's just that until your mother and father actually get here I really feel I have to stand in their place. Uh, we thought we'd just arrange the wedding ourselves. Of course, you can and will. All I'm offering are suggestions. Shortcuts. After all, I have been married a number of times. [laughing] [Aunt Flo] 'Introductions to the right service people. Caterers, engravers, florists. I got a wonderful florist. And some assurances that good taste be observed. Do we have a problem with good taste? Obviously not, my dear young man. I mean, look who you've chosen to marry. 'No, it's-it's just that' I feel an extra responsibility since.. Darling...it looks like your father is going to have some difficulty getting here. - If he does get here at all. - Oh, no. Well, they're having civil unrest down there or whatever it is they're calling revolution these days. I finally did get a telephone call through to your poor dear mother and she said that under the circumstances, perhaps it would be best for me to stand in for her. 'Make any decisions she might make.' Um, I wonder if you saw the wedding has been mentioned in Walter Winchell's column. Actually, Aunt Flo, we're planning a small wedding at the little church around the corner with just our family and some friends. And some neighbors from Walton's Mountain. Well, u-uh.. Darling. What about your father's associates in the diplomatic corps? What will they think if I allow you to get married in that dowdy little church? St. Bartholomew's would be so much more appropriate. You could play the World Series in there. [laughing] Yes, you could. Aunt Flo, we appreciate your concern but we really do wanna keep it simple. Children, I know it seems like an awful lot to go through but after all it is these rituals that separate us from the savages. Maybe we should think about it, John. We have thought about it. We've talked about it for hours. We've invited people. We've reserved the church. Oh, that. Oh, darling. Not to worry. All that can be arranged. Just leave everything to me. Saturday Evening Post. John, I want you to know there's some good stuff in here and there's some stuff that's not so good. I know. I'm not satisfied with it either. - What's the problem? - I wish I knew. My own grandmother. I've known her all my life. I can't get her down on paper. I like her relationship with the grandfather. Oh, they worship each other. And her determination to keep going after the stroke. [John] Grandma's always been a real fighter. It has the makings of exactly the kind of article I'm looking for, John. But it has no depth. May be we should get some background on her family history. Where does all that grit come from? Sybil, I'm gonna need more time than you've given me for this. I'd love to, John, but my deadline's firm. There's no way to change it now. Okay, okay, don't worry about it. I'll get it done. I wonder if this isn't a case where we've taken the boy out of the country and the country out of the boy at the same time. It's possible. It's hard not to get a citified veneer when you've been living in New York for a while. Maybe you might find this article easier to write if you went back to that mountain of yours for a visit. That could be. I suspect, John. You need to go back to the well. 'Spend some time with your grandmother.' Get in touch with your original inspiration. Well, I'm always looking for an excuse to go back home. You've got one. Maybe. [knocking] [John] 'It's me.' Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't make dinner. I-I tried to reach you but your line's been busy. I took the phone off the hook. Your Aunt Flo called to suggest the Sherry Netherland for the reception. She gets that way when she's in the middle of a project. Call her off, Janet. She's driving me crazy. - I've got a deadline. - She's only trying to help. Mother would take care of these things, but we can't reach her. The phone lines are down. She's not your mother, and she's taking over our wedding. Let's not fight. We're both tired. Maybe you should go back to Walton's Mountain to finish your article. You're the second person who's told me that. Everybody wants me out of the way. I just don't want us to be at each other's throats. Not now. Not before the wedding. How can I go anywhere when you look at me like that? [Aunt Flo] 'Hello. Hello. Somebody left the door open. Oh, John. How lucky to find you here too. Aunt Flo, what are you doing here? I've just come from a perfectly marvelous party and you'll never guess who's back in town. David Drucker. He was over in Monaco. He was doing one of his charity balls for the Grimaldis. He built the whole affair on a Scottish Highland theme. He's mad, he's just completely mad. Anyway, when I told him about you children 'he insisted on seeing you and giving you some ideas.' Oh, Aunt Flo. You know we're both terribly busy. Oh, I know. I said they couldn't take more than a minute. But you see once we have the plan settled on you can just leave it to me to carry it out. We need to talk about this. John, I couldn't possibly wiggle out of this. I mean, he's offering his services as a favor to me. And you're gonna to love his ideas. You know, for this Scottish thing, he had a regiment. I mean an entire regiment. A regiment of bagpipers. And he served stuffed Scottish grouse. You ever had stuffed Scottish grouse? Actually, I like them. They nest in the woods outside our house. My dad used to go in the morning and shoot 'em for breakfast. In fact, they taste absolutely delicious if you fry them with a mess of biscuits and brown gravy. You know, you're right. I'll be back home on Walton's Mountain. [door opens and closes] Oh, my dear. I hope I didn't offend him. I mean, it doesn't have to be grouse. Pheasant would do perfectly. [owl hooting] [door closing] 'Evening, Liv.' - Evening. - Is that anyone I know? "Feminine Mystique." What's that? Some kind of romantic novel that Corabeth gave you? Not exactly. - Has ma gone to bed? - An hour ago. Kept your supper warm for you. Yeah. The meeting ran overtime. The sky is changing so fast, it's hard to keep up. If I'd known this supervisor's job was gonna take so much time I never would have run for office. When those voters find out how smart you are.. ...they're gonna want you to run for governor. How'd you like to be First Lady of Virginia? [Olivia chuckling] I'd rather go back to school. - Seriously. - You unhappy, Liv? Sometimes when I'm here in the house by myself with nothing to do and nobody to look after I start wondering what I'm good for. Is something in this book bothering you? I'll tell you something if you promise you won't laugh. The other morning, I found myself looking at you and wondering who is that stranger? Did you ever look at me like that? I can't say as I have. Guess I just need to get to know myself a little better. Find out where I fit in the world. There is so much I wanna know and so much I don't know. If it's that important to you, Liv maybe you ought to go back to school. You might like living with a co-ed. I think you'd look nice in saddle shoes and a tight sweater. I'll see about dessert. The only dessert I want is you. Now, let's see, um...what'd you say your name was? This conversation is not over. And then the husband says "Well, what do you expect after 50 years of marriage." [laughing] Anybody for seconds? - Oh, me. Me, me. - Mmm, not you. Why not? Because you've put on too much weight. - Even for your ninth month. - Yes, doctor. But you can help me to seconds. Me too. You've decided on a name? Yes. If it's a girl, Patsy Cline Walton. - And if it's a boy? - Elvis. Of course. - Hi, mama. - Hi. Mother and baby are doing fine. Took all three of you to figure that out? We're here to help. Elizabeth, I think you'd better pay close attention because I've seen a gleam in Drew's eye lately. No, I'm not gonna have any children yet. I'm going back to school. There's no reason you can't do both. I just signed up for a class at Boatwright College. - 'American Studies.' - Mama, that's great. My mother the freshman. I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death. This mean I'm gonna have to find a new babysitter? I'll always be there for my grandchildren. And that includes you. You be sure and let me know the minute it's on its way. You got it. Better call me first if I'm gonna deliver it. Toni, that baby better hurry up or you're not gonna make John-Boy's wedding. Actually, I plan to have it during the ceremony. [laughing] [Toni] I'm not missing the wedding. Brides are getting more beautiful every day. I would suggest that we get Halsman to photograph you. Well, I've already arranged a photographer from my magazine. He's done shoots for me before. I'll phone his agent later today. Flo, now what have you come up with so far? St. Bartholomew's Cathedral. - An evening ceremony, I think. - Mm-hmm? Well, actually, we were planning on a morning ceremony. Wonderful. Morning coats, top hats. I've always wanted to do a wedding with the bridal party arriving in a carriage. I don't think John's family will go for morning coats. They're country people from Virginia. The Virginians I know are the tweedy types. Fox hunters. Horses. Hounds. Actually, they are mountain people. Ah, I don't do moonshine. [laughing] You don't have to. Two old ladies from the mountain are bringing enough for all. We'd better come up with another idea, David. Alright. Alright. Ah, I'm thinking of white lace. A sea of candles. Aunt Flo, that's not what we have in mind at all. String quartet. Not quite right, David. A thousand Cymbidium orchids which I'll have flown in from Hawaii, of course. [bell tolling] [female #2] Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. Could you tell me which way to the Science Building? I'm sorry, I'm lost too, if I don't hurry up and figure out where I'm going, I'm gonna be late for class. What do you teach? I'm not a teacher here. I'm a student. Oh, I wish my mama would come back to school. She's not even as o...old as you. Is that what I look like? An old mother. Oh, well, you don't look old or anything. But you don't look like a regular student. I-I mean, look, I'm sorry, ma'am. [chuckling] Little twit. [male #1] And it will include a unit on contemporary political movements. 'Are there any questions?' Mmm. Surprise, surprise. Class dismissed. Uh, Mrs. Walton, I'd like to see you for a moment. You want to speak to me? I-I was curious as to why you signed up for this class. I wanted to know more about our country. Mm-hmm. What makes it work? How it works? Sometimes, how it doesn't work? I thought this would be a good place to start. To start what? Back to school. I'm hoping to take more classes next semester. Maybe get my degree eventually. Female students your age are generally isolated from the student population. They find studying difficult and they miss assignments when their children get sick and very often they end up failing or dropping out. Well, I don't intend to do either. Well, all the same, I'm not sure you belong in this class. Have you considered taking, uh.. ...home economics? Professor Trumbull, I could teach home economics with what I've learned raising seven children and being married half my life. I could also teach nursing, bookkeeping, psychology first aid, carpentry, and gardening. I can shovel snow, I can deal with a leaky faucet dead car battery and a leaky roof. What I cannot deal with is human ignorance. Well.. ...this is certainly going to be an interesting semester. [birds chirping] Carry your books? Oh, John-Boy, what a nice surprise. I am so proud of you going to college. I can't believe it. If I'd known how hard it was gonna be I might've thought twice. What are you doing here? I came home to finish writing an article. [laughing] The minute we heard you were writing about grandma we rushed to help. No. Nothing's changed. They still won't let me get any work done. Don't forget the time that grandpa got thrown out of the hospital when grandma had her stroke. That was something else. Or the time she found the jar of a recipe in grandpa's toolbox. [Bob] She didn't speak to him for a whole month after that. Keep that up, and grandma won't let John-Boy write an article about her at all. How do you like the idea of being a celebrity, ma? Come on. Well, grandma. Maybe they'll put you on the cover. ♪ Grandma was a cover girl Grandma was a cover girl ♪ ♪ Grandma was a cover girl on a big-time magazine ♪ I love having brothers and sisters but I'm gonna need a lock for my door. ♪ Grandma was a cover girl Grandma was a cover girl ♪ ♪ On a big-time ♪ ♪ I said a big-time magazine ♪ [applause] Woo. [knocking on door] Come in. - Still up, son? - 'Yeah.' You know, I've been thinking. That old cabin over by Drucilla's Pond? Yeah? That'd be a quiet place for you. That is a great idea. I'll take my stuff over in the morning. What you got there, the old family Bible? Yeah, I've been studying it looking at the births, deaths, weddings, baptisms. The whole family's here. Except I can't find a single entry for grandma's daddy. You won't find him in here either. I won't? Why not? Grandma has her reasons. She might not like you stirring things up either. Don't work too late, son. I won't. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [slow music] [insects chirping] [yawning] Ah, I keep reading the same sentence over and over again. I think my brain's stopped working. Same here. No matter how many times I add up these bills I just can't figure out how we're gonna pay for all that equipment. I knew I should've kept a closer eye on Ben. You couldn't be in two places at once. Runnin' the mill and the campaign, both. For once, I thought our money problems was over. I could wring his neck. Ben thought he was doin' the right thing. On top of everything else is John-Boy's wedding. There's new clothes, trip to New York, hotel rooms. There's that rehearsal dinner we're supposed to put on. I suppose that'll mean a fancy restaurant. This whole thing could cost us over a thousand dollars. Oh, oh. If that subdivision goes through, won't that help? That's what puts me in a bind, Liv. If I vote for the subdivision it looks like I'm featherin' my own nest. If I vote against it, we're gonna lose a lot of money. [slow music] [birds chirping] Thank the Lord some things don't change. [John] Sparrows still nest in the eaves. Fish still bite in the pond. There's that canoe I used to paddle around in. [John] Yeah. We bring it in each winter, patch her up in the spring. I give your mama a ride when the weather warms. Hope Janet and I are gonna be happy as you and mama. I don't wanna pry but everything alright between you and Janet? You showed up kinda sudden. She's got an aunt that's takin' over the wedding and I had to get out of there. Before marrying, you ever wonder you were doing the right thing? I don't know a man who didn't get the jitters. I've been single so long, I got my own way of doin' things. Closer it gets, I start wondering if I'm gonna be able to change my ways. She's probably wonderin' the same thing. What? How would you feel if she changed her mind? That'll about kill me. There's your answer. You know, if you love each other enough all the doubt in the world won't keep you from being together. Daddy, it would mean a lot to me if you'd be my best man. Oh, son, you got brothers for that. Oh, I can't play favorites. Come to think of it, I probably am the best man in your life. [chuckles] Are you saying yes? John-Boy, I'd be honored. You holler if you need anything. Thank you, daddy. - Now, this one. - Yes. Perfect for the men. Absolutely perfect. [doorbell chimes] - 'What about the ladies?' - 'Well, no.' 'I can always depend on your taste. 'You don't mean that. I can tell you're lying.' What is it? What's wrong? Oh, everything is fine, dear. Why do you ask? I was in a meeting and my secretary brought in a message that said that you had to see me at once. Darling, I'm sorry, but we had to consult with you. David has come up with an idea that will appeal to you and your young man. Ready? A folk wedding. We'll rent a ballroom at the Waldorf and decorate it like a barn. 'Shocks of corn. Bales of hay.' 'Pumpkins and pomegranates, etc.' We'll bring up a country band from Nashville and some dancers. Now, I have already spoken with Agnes. And she is going to choreograph some special folk dances. And Rudi says he'll be the caller. Everybody will be able to wear overalls and plaid shirts-- I hate it. - I beg your pardon. - I hate it. Oh.. We were so sure that this time we'd gotten it right. Aunt Flo, I don't want a hillbilly wedding. I don't want a ballroom at the Warldorf nor do I want my guests wearing overalls and plaid shirts. And I do not want Rudolph Nureyuv calling the dances. At this point, I'm thinking of not getting married at all. Maybe I'll just live in sin. No, darling. I don't recommend it. Now, not to worry. David and I will come up with an idea that's suitable for the daughter of an ambassador. Aunt Flo.. ...I love you. David, I-I know you mean well but this is not another of your charity balls. This is my wedding. This is mywedding. And I'm taking it back. [door opens and closes] So, you need anything else, John-Boy? No, thanks, Ike. That's about it. John-Boy, you may have heard that I too am pursuing the literary muse. Oh, well, I wish you luck, Corabeth. Perhaps you'd be willing to read a chapter or two of my novel. As a favor, you might say, from one wordsmith to the other. I'd love to, but now is not a good time 'cause I'm working. Oh, I understand that perfectly. - Tomorrow perhaps? - We'll talk about it sometime. It's good to see you, Corabeth. Take care, Ike. See ya, John-Boy. [male #1] And what of the other symbols we have come to associate with our country? Can anybody tell me where Plymouth Rock is located? Does anyone know when Jamestown was founded? 'Who can tell me the statement of the Statue of Liberty' its significance to us all? Mrs. Walton.. '...you've had little at all to say in this class thus far.' Do you have any ideas? Are you going to remain silent all term? A woman...named Emma Lazarus wrote the poem that's on the base of the Statue of Liberty. [softly] Ah.. And would you be so kind as to locate a copy of that poem and bring it to class one day? I know the poem if you'd like to hear it. [male #1] By all means. 'It goes..' ..."Give me your tired, your poor "your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. "The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door." Very well said. But it doesn't tell us how you perceive the ideas 'it is trying to convey, Mrs. Walton.' I was about to do that, Professor Trumbull. The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of hope for people coming from other countries. To me, she's like a mother offering them shelter and love and a place to dream. And since all our forefathers came from somewhere else I guess that applies to all of us. I think that's the message the poem is trying to convey. What do we have here, a petition? That's right. It is. There are 65 names on there. And they are all concerned citizens who don't think that the development will be good 'for Jefferson County.' Well, I'm a little surprised. Wouldn't this bring new customers into your store, Ike? Well, not if they build a new supermarket up there. And the taxes will go up. And suppose they decide to pave all the roads? It could mean a lot of new jobs. That would be good for the whole community. We know all that. What really is at stake is the way we live. 'Simple and neighborly and our doors are always unlocked' and the welcome mat is always out. We don't want Walton's Mountain to be turned into 'some kind of suburb.' I understand. Well, I can't promise you how I'll vote. But I'll give this serious consideration. We knew you would. That's why we voted for you. Madison's tied up all this land at the base of Pinetop Mountain. They want to build 25 duplexes and 50 single family homes. That's a lot of lumber. We could get rich on it. And there'll be plenty of jobs. - What do you think of it, ma? - I don't know. I don't even know where I stand yet either. 'I can see both sides.' [door opening] Oh, I'm glad somebody's still up. How's the writin' going? I've been over to the courthouse going through records. I went to the county library. Not a word. As if the man never existed. Why's it so important now? It's one thing to avoid something because it's uncomfortable. But to erase a man from history. You're making a mountain out of a molehill. No. If there's a skeleton hiding in the family closet, grandma I'd like to know what it is. I want my story to be honest. How can it be honest if a big piece of your history is missing? - Go easy on her, son. - She wouldn't want me to. - She's the toughest person. - John-Boy, you're over-tired. You can say that again. [knocking on door] Janet, sweetheart, what are you doing here? I just threw myself together, and I got out of New York. What happened? - Hi. - Hey. I've taken a leave of absence from my job. If it's alright with everybody, I'd-I'd like for us to get married here at Walton's Mountain. I think that would be great. What about Aunt Flo? I fired her. Olivia, I'm not even sure my folks are gonna make it. I'm on my own and I need you. Well, bring your things in and get settled. We'll talk about making plans later. Come on. I can't say I'm unhappy about this but how are we gonna manage a wedding on top of everything else? I haven't the slightest idea. [knock on door] Who is it? Oh, Corabeth. It's so nice to see you but I'm-I'm really busy. Oh, good! I deduced that you might be scribbling away. Corabeth, I don't scribble. I write. There's a big difference. I did not mean to make light of our profession. And I didn't mean to be rude. I got so much on my mind. I'm behind schedule and I can't express what I need to say. Well, perhaps if you hear just a bit of my novel that will clear the cobwebs away. I find there's nothing so inspiring as the company of a fellow writer. Go right ahead. 'Of course, this is just a rough draft.' "Romance on the High Sea.. "...by Corabeth Godsey. "The young novelist, Pierre Boudin "stood on the deck, his shirt unbuttoned to the waist "revealing a wind-burned chest rippling with masculine muscularity." Corabeth, young novelists rarely strip to the waist-- "Below, the beautiful young model lay trembling "as she awaited his footsteps. "She knew he would come, and her bosoms heaved "at the thought of his fiery hands on her firm young flesh." I hope this is not too strong for you, John-Boy. I'm...speechless. Oh, thank you. You have no idea how much your praise means to me. "The helpless young woman knew that to resist him was futile and the desperate pounding of her heart--" Corabeth, stop it. Please. Please stop. Stop. Really? Really, there's much more. Corabeth...I don't know how to tell you this. It's not good. It's.. It's not good. But...I'm following the instructions that came with that correspondence course. And I was inspired by the romance 'between you and Janet.' I don't like hurting your feelings. But you're my friend. So I have to be truthful about your...work. You probably can be a writer. But instead of this nonsense, you gotta start writing about something that you're familiar with. Something you've experienced and observed. Something that you care about with feeling and passion. I'm afraid I've experienced very little in my lifetime. You might think that's true but if you look, I'll bet you'll find that there's plenty of love and romance in your own life. But you gotta look for it. I'm sorry, Corabeth, but I had to be honest. Oh, and I appreciate it. I do. And Corabeth, there's one more thing. Your hero's name, Boudin? It means...pudding. [door opens and closes] Oh, how about this one? Isn't it wonderful? It's not really you. I don't think it's really anyone. I like this one. Oh, that's too sexy for a bridesmaid's dress. Let's go somewhere else where they carry the latest styles. You know, the best shop in town? [both] This is the best shop in town. Oh! 'Janet, it's time to learn about high fashion' 'on Walton's Mountain.' Oh, I'd love to help, but I can't sew. Janet. You can cut. I can cut. Right here. It's a good place to start. Just cutting right along the line. All the way around. Oh, there you are, Corabeth. I'm sorry, I didn't wanna wake you so early. Oh, very considerate of you but I wanted to get this in the mail quickly. - Your correspondence course. - I'm returning it. It's filled with erroneous advice. I expect to get my money back as promised in the advertisement. I never got to read your first novel. I have abandoned it. I'm starting a new work entitled "The Storekeeper's Wife." Doesn't sound very romantic. Au contraire,John-Boy assuresme that there is a great deal of romance and love in being a storekeeper's wife. Do you really believe that, Corabeth? Mr. Godsey, please. Not in broad daylight. Where's your high-powered crew? They're out making a delivery. - Selling more lumber, I hope. - I'll give you a hand. There're some gloves over there. I need a chance to let off some steam. Yeah, same with me. There's some rumors going around I don't like. Bad rumors? Well, something about me being a crook. You got too good a reputation. Nobody's gonna believe that. Don't count on it. This is politics. Right over here. -This alright? -Yep. How's that article coming? I'm not getting anywhere with it. I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look at it. - I don't know about writing. - But you do know grandma. That's for sure. - Alright, I'll give it a try. - Thanks. [bell tolls] Ah, Mrs. Walton, what a pleasure. Come walk with me to my next class. Don't we have an appointment today? Yes, I have to clear my topic for that oral report you assigned us. Have you gotten an idea yet? Yes. I'd like to do something on the status of women in America. Well, you'll have to be more specific. I'm reading this book by Betty Friedan. It's called The Feminine Mystique. What makes you think that would be appropriate for my class? She explains how difficult it is for women to achieve in our society. Some people try to make it difficult for us to have careers or...to get an education. It seems to me our country would be stronger if we made it possible for everybody to take part. Alright, Mrs. Walton, you can go ahead with it. But I am warning you, this is not the kind of subject matter that will assure you a passing grade. You don't get it. It's not the grade that's important to me. It's the future of women in this country I worry about. Half the population in this country is female and three of those women are my daughters. I don't know your three daughters. But I'm beginning to know you. And I think I would be quite foolish indeed to antagonize the Walton women to say nothing of half the population of this country. Huh, good luck with it. We're delighted your nuptials are gonna take place on Walton's Mountain, John-Boy. So am I, Miss Emily. You'll be married in the very church that Ashley Longworth and I were to march down the aisle. Yes, ma'am. Here you are, John-Boy. Papa's old portmanteau. It has all his letters. And I hope, you find what you're looking for. - Thank you, Miss Mamie. - You take it. I'll take care of it and bring it back as soon as possible. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye, Miss Emily. - Bye. Oh, what a fine, young man. I wonder whatever became of Ashley Longworth. He kissed me, you know. 'It was in October' and all the leaves were the color of gold. It's a long way from St. Bartholomew's. It's-it's intimate. I still can't believe it. In a few days, dad and I will be walking down this aisle. Yup. Well, I'm not quite as distinguished as Ambassador Gilchrist but would you care to practice? Dad can be intimidating but when you get to know my parents you'll find they're good people. I'm looking forward to meeting 'em. Do you ever sleep with the windows open? - Year round. How about you? - I love fresh air. - Do you like to read in bed? - I like to read everywhere. How do you feel about big families? I don't know how I feel about any-size family. Big, medium, or little. Probably guess that's something we're gonna have to talk about. I've never been around babies. They scare me. Too bad, you had to fall in love with a Walton. Maybe you shouldn't be marrying an only child. Does it make a difference.. ...when we have each other? I guess not. [door opening] 'Lot of homework, huh?' Mostly I've been working on those bridesmaid's dresses. How's John-Boy's article? Tell you the truth, I don't think it's very good. He can't concentrate. He's got a lot of things on his mind. I know. That's why I can't tell him that. You have to. He asked you to be honest. It seems like we got an awful lot of things to worry about around here lately. Do you think John-Boy and Janet are right for each other? I think Janet can hold her own with our son, Liv. I don't think writers are easy to live with. She is a thoroughbred. That's what worries me. They come from such different backgrounds. That's what people said about us when we got married. I guess differences don't always matter. Some of them do. Why, John Walton. [honking] What the heck? [dog barking] [country music] What's goin' on out there? [music continues] Just hold your horses! Hello. I know it's a little late to come calling but I've been searching all over this countryside for a hotel and I've come to the conclusion that there isn't one. You're right. This isn't one either. Aunt Flo? Wha-what are you doing here? Janet, darling, I was thinking about your honeymoon. I was in the bath and.. Oh, how do you do? And, um, I had the most wonderful idea. You've got to let me do this for you, sweetheart. [Janet] 'Fine, fine. Come on in.' So that's Aunt Flo. [grunts] Oh! Gee! [birds chirping] - Good morning, daddy. - 'Mornin'.' Whatever that is, I hope it's edible. Your mama was teaching Janet to make baking powder biscuits. They wanted you to have some. I like the room service at this hotel. Thank you. Mmm. Janet wanted me to tell you her Aunt Flo got in last night. Isn't she gonna give up. Where is she? She's staying with us. I'll avoid the house as much as possible. That was my plan. - I read your article, son. - What do you think? I don't know. Seems to me that, maybe you're looking at your grandma through rose-colored glasses. I know. I left the vinegar out. You turned her into some kind of saint. You know if grandma hadn't been tough and stubborn as a mule she never would've overcome her stroke or gone on living without grandpa. I intended toughening her up, it's just that.. I think what's throwing this whole thing off is the missing ancestry story. This gap in her family history. 'I just can't get past that.' Well, I gave you my two cents worth. I'll let you get on with your work. Thanks, daddy. [breathing heavily] - Hi, kids. - Hi, mama. Grandma. I went to see the Baldwin ladies the other day. And they gave me some of your papa's old papers and I found this letter about your daddy. I thought we agreed to forget about that. You know what I found out from this letter? Grandpa Morgan fought with the Union in the Civil War. - Damnit! Damnit! Damnit! - Alright. Alright. The war of Northern Aggression. John-Boy. 'I also found out he was anti-slavery' 'like a lot of these hill people.' And when he joined the Union Army everyone around here called him a traitor. [Olivia] 'Is that all, grandma?' Is that what you didn't want us to find out? As far as I'm concerned, my great-granddaddy is a hero. I wanna tell the world about him. It's alright, ma. I'll talk to him. Daddy, this should not be a secret. It's wrong to bury somebody's history. That's enough, son. I think...we should all sleep on this, especially grandma. It's not good for her to get upset like this. Grandma, I'm sorry about this. I love you, and I respect you but I'm gonna write the truth. 'Oh-oh, something's up.' Maybe I oughta go, huh? You better not. Morning, daddy. I thought it was good till I read this. "Supervisor Walton in sweetheart deal with developer. "It's been discovered that John Walton and Son Lumber Company "has a lucrative contract with Madison Developers "to supply lumber should their subdivision receive county approval." And that vote comes tonight. Go on, read. There's more. "Supervisor Walton's integrity is in question for his failure to report this conflict of interest." Not only is our whole business at stake but so is my reputation. For 200 years, our family has lived in these parts and this is the first time that a shadow's been put on our name. A stain like this hangs around. On me, on your brothers and sisters, on everybody. Daddy, I'm really sorry. You got me in to this. What are you gonna do about it? I don't know. I wouldn't blame you if you threw me out. I feel the same way, John. You oughta fire both of us right now. I'm considerin' it. [Ben sighs] It's bad enough she tried to take over the wedding. She is not gonna take over the honeymoon. [Janet] 'Would you please stop shouting?' She's only suggesting that we go to the Bahamas. Suggesting? She already bought the airline tickets. 'She hired a limousine to go to the airport.' - She's made reservations. - She meant well. She's only trying to do something nice. She'll be at our wedding night to ensure we get that right. You might've been appreciative. You insulted her. It was long overdue! Maybe we should call the whole thing off! That's fine. Maybe I can get some work done. - Fine! - Fine! Fine. [car starts] John-Boy. Janet. [knock on door] How you doin'? I tried to call my mom, but the lines are down. I don't know what to do. I know it's not the same but she's there, and I'm here. Is there anything I can do? I never knew he had such a temper. Oh, he has a temper, alright. Takes a lot for him to lose it. He yelled at me. Well, you were doing some pretty good yelling yourself. I don't know what made me think I wanted to marry him. All of a sudden, he seems like a total stranger. I know what you mean. Marriage changes everything, doesn't it? It sure does. First, you lose your name. You find strange clothes in your closet. You discover that wonderful man you married snores in his sleep and you consider the consequences of murder. All my life, I've never had to share my room with anyone. I've been able to do what I wanna do when I wanna do it. All that's gonna be different. Maybe that's what's bothering you. Instead of John-Boy being upset over what he has a right to be upset over. Hard being married, isn't it? It's the hardest thing you'll ever do. - I'm scared. - Marriage is scary. But I think it's worth it. No. I'm scared he won't come back. Oh! [male #2] 'Alright. Let's settle down.' [hammering] Let's settle down, please. [hammering] The first item on the agenda is Madison's request to build a one hundred unit subdivision. 'In regard to this issue, there may be a conflict of interest' 'on the Board of Supervisors.' Mr. Walton, would you care to address the accusations against you? Mr. Chairman, may I have the floor? - I'd like to say something. - Go ahead, Ben. Father asked me to take care of the mill during his campaign. I made the deal with Madison Development Company. Long before I knew that my father was gonna be coming here to vote today. Daddy never had anything to do with any of this. I just wanted him to be proud of me. Instead, I've made him look bad. I'm sorry. [group chattering] 'If there are no objections, let's move on to the vote.' Now, you all know where I stand. I feel that the subdivision would benefit Jefferson County. I vote, yes. All supervisors in favor, could I see a show of hands. Two. Opposed? 'Two oppose.' Supervisor Walton, looks like it's up to you. It seems to me we have a problem. There's unemployment here. Folks need jobs. 'At the same time, we don't want to destroy' 'the air and the water and the woods' 'that makes Jefferson County such a fine place to live in.' So...I'm gonna vote no on this proposal. 'But if those folks bring back a simpler proposal' that provides jobs but doesn't ruin the air we breathe or the water we drink then I'll vote for it. 'And if they do come back with a new proposal' I'll make damn sure my company's not involved. Mr. Anderson, it could've turned out different. - Handled that well, John. - Thank you, Ike. Goodnight, fellas. I like the way you handled yourself tonight, son. I appreciate it. Drew and I are willing to take a cut in pay till we get outta this hole. I just might have to take you up on that. Unless you get out there and hustle up some business. - Yes, sir. - Yeah, you bet. Just don't stand there, let's see some hustle. - Okay, daddy. - Let's do it. [crickets chirping] John. You're a tougher young man than I thought. You're pretty tough yourself. You know, uh.. John, I see that I have caused you and Janet some distress. But I want you to know that I.. ...I acted only out of love. I never doubted that. I never had any children of my own. I think I just forgot to. And my brother just had the one. 'And I was there when Janet was born' 'and I looked forward to being there when she married.' But I really think now that I should leave before I break up this wedding altogether. Too late for that. You can't leave now. Why? Because you're family. Besides, I thought you were gonna be my matron of honor. Sweetie. Only if you promise to toss the wedding bouquet in my general direction. [Janet] 'I promise.' I'm sorry. I should not have yelled at you like that. I'm sorry too. I.. I didn't know how to stand up to Flo. Well.. ...the Bahamas are fine with me. No. No, no. We'll make our own plans. We'll...go someplace simple and quiet where we can be by ourselves, just the two of us. Why don't you leave our first night to me? I know just the place. It's a small inn on the north side of Drucilla's Pond. Quiet. You can hear the leaves rustle at night. In the morning, you can hear the birds call to each other. That sounds good. And the next day.. ...we'll go to the Bahamas. We will? Too good a deal to pass up. [laughing] It's a beautiful quilt, Olivia. How long have you been working on it? Oh, quite a while. I had a feeling the first time I met Janet. Has quilting been a family tradition for a long time? It goes back a way. A family is like the rings made when a pebble drops in a pond. 'Like the rings on this quilt.' I wonder, if I had, had a quilt like this perhaps, one of my marriages might've lasted a little longer. [laughing] It takes more than a quilt. [Aunt Flo] 'You should know.' What's your secret, Olivia? I've no idea. Sometimes, I think I know a thing or two. Then a whole new set of problems comes up. I'd like to think that each stitch is like a special wish for the bride and groom. My stitches are for the happiness I wish them in the years to come. What is my wish for them? The word is romance. It's what makes the world go round. I wish them a happy, carefree wedding and forgiveness for my excesses. [laughing] You were forgiven a long time ago. Where's grandma? Isn't she going to join us? Nope. She says she's not even coming to the wedding. Oh, mama! What happened? [phone rings] Would you get that, Janet? It's probably for John-Boy. Walton residence. Speaking. Dad! How are you? Where are you? It's my folks. They're at the airport in London. 'John and I will pick you up at the airport' 'in Charlottesville tomorrow night.' Wonderful. See you then. Bravo! I don't understand what's keeping 'em. They should've been here an hour ago. Will you stop worrying and sit down? I've never entertained an ambassador before. If they're anything like Janet, they'll be real down to earth. What's the name of that country he's ambassador to? I'll think of it. Oh, this tie is killing me. I'll be glad when this wedding stuff is over. [phone rings] Get back to normal livin'. Hello? Janet! You alright? We'll be right there. - What's up? - They're all in jail. 'Jail?' - Howdy, folks. - We're here to see-- - Daddy! - Oh, there he is. - John-Boy, what's going on? - Janet, what happened? The plane was late, I was trying to make up some time on the way home. He was doing that alright. 75 per in a 60-mile zone. - John-Boy. - You lock people up for that? We do. When they yell at the officer and call him "Stupid." Uh, John, Olivia, these are my parents Uh, Ralph and Charlotte Gilchrist. [both] How do you do? That one kept talking about something, uh diplomatic impunity, whatever that is. I-I am a United States ambassador. That entitles me to certain privileges. And I am a deputy sheriff of Jefferson County, Virginia and this is my jail. Mr. Walton, my husband and I left a small African country over 48 hours ago. In that time, we've not had a change of clothes a decent meal or used a clean bathroom. Could you please get us out of here? Yes, ma'am. Now, you must be new around here, deputy. I'm John Walton, County Supervisor. And you're just gonna have to learn something about this diplomatic.. [both] Immunity. ...immunity. Supervisor Walton. Yeah, I know about you. We sure could use some things fixed around here when you get a chance. And we need to get these people outta here. These two young people are getting married tomorrow. Well, why didn't you say so? I'm letting you off with just a warning. Well, that's decent of you. Now, if you'll open this cell door, we'll be on our way. Can't. It's broke. You get me a bigger budget, and I'll fix it. - Ah! - Oh! Now, you must make sure this thing can lock. Any criminal could walk out.. No, no, not you. Oh, don't worry. He'll-he'll get over it. Sorry about this, daddy. I'd say we haven't exactly gotten off to a beautiful start with the Gilchrists. Janet, in my professional life I have found myself in some very strange places. Still, I have trouble believing that I am in the backwoods of Virginia. Miles from a streetlight, with a clan of people that seems to number into the thousands. And that my daughter is about to marry into that clan of folksy, fertile poor but honest salt of the Earth mountaineers. Have-have-have you given this sufficient thought? I think so. And you're totally comfortable with what you're doing? Even though it may mean that you'll have to subsist on chitlins and bootleg liquor when the going gets tough? I've never been happier in my life, daddy. Good. Because I like your young man, and I like where he comes from. These are good people. There's only one thing, daddy. I doubt very much they've ever had chitlins in their lives. Well, bring 'em on out to Iowa, and we'll give 'em a sample. Tell her, Charlotte. Well, your father has decided to retire from the Diplomatic Corps. We wanna be home again. We want you to have a home to come home to. Not an embassy in some troubled country. We're going home to Iowa to buy back the house on East River Drive. I've always loved that house. I know. Well, you've gotten in touch with John's roots. In Iowa, John can get in touch with yours. You know, I cannot wait to bring him and our children to that house. How many children do you have in mind? Well, let's put it this way. He's a Walton. [laughs] Look at that moon. How about when all this is over I take you on a second honeymoon? Good. Aunt Flo can arrange it. Maybe that little cottage in the Bahamas is free. Well, with all this wedding stuff and that moon. How about going to Bahamas? If it's between semesters. Liv, what is a Bahama, and where is it? It's probably a little south of here. [laughing] I love you. [owl hooting] Do you think your parents will ever forgive me? For landing them in jail? No, for taking you away from 'em. My dad said you were folksy and fertile. [laughing] Okay. But he and mother both approve. Do you realize... this is the last time that we will look up at the moon as single people? You scared? I'm terrified. Me too. It's not too late to back out, you know? I'm saving it for the altar. Oh! Oh, my God, are you alright? [laughing] [tapping] [loud bang] What's that racket? [tapping continues] There's a whole bunch of strangers out there. Looks like Aunt Flo is in charge. [groan] Darling, don't drop that table. Yes, ma'am. Oh, young man, I want the bandstand and the dance floor to be at an angle off the mill. It'll fit, I've just paced it. Oh, flowers? Yeah. [whistles] - Flowers? - Yes, ma'am. Yes. Come right here with me. Hello, darling. What's she doing now? I think she's trying to make up for all the trouble she caused. Charlotte, what's going on? This is Flo's gift to the newlyweds. A party with all the fixings. Do they know about this? Believe it or not, she spoke to them, and they agreed. She's giving them the kind of party that they really want. These tables end-to-end across here in a line for the food. [whistles] I had a first sergeant once not half as tough as she is. [Aunt Flo] 'No, eight chairs around each of the round tables' and then scatter some of the chairs randomly beyond the tables where the food is. - Breakfast? - Yes. [Aunt Flo] 'Now, somebody bring me a ladder..' Breakfast, pa? We got it. Just keep breathing. Janet, your friends from New York have arrived. Ah. Thanks, Elizabeth. Mom, do I look okay? Perfectly beautiful. All of you are beautiful. - Thank you. - Thank you. I like having sisters help me dress. How are you feeling inside? Like I might be ill. [soft piano music] Grandma. You wouldn't really miss my wedding, would you? It's the most important day of my life 'and I'd like you to share it with me.' I'm sorry that I hurt you but if this is your way of punishing me, it's working. Of course, I can't blame you. You're as stubborn as your father was. He did what he felt was right no matter what people thought. And I know somebody else who would have admired him too. My grandpa. I wish he was gonna be here today. It's gonna be tough not having any grandparents at my own wedding. I don't know. [sighs] My very best and most favorite husband gave me this. We were in Paris. We were standing on the Pont Alexandre. The most beautiful bridge in the world. And he said to me, "Flo "I give you this bridge and this little piece of lace to remind you of it always." Thank you, Aunt Flo. Thank you for everything. Well, you know I like to help. My darling, I do not have a bridge to give you. Just my love. And one more thing. My mother wore these on her wedding day. I wore them on mine. I want you to give them to your daughter when the time comes. Thank you, mom. Look who's gonna be next. [laughing] - Not me. - Oh...how about you? - Mm-hmm, not again. - Aww. I don't know what's the matter with me today. I cannot tie my tie for love nor money. I'd say it's more love than money. Just like old times, huh? You have to stand behind me just like you were tying your own tie. - Here you go. - Got it? - Is that alright? - Yeah, it looks pretty good. Daddy, were you this nervous when you got married? Well, your mom and me eloped. But, yeah, I was nervous. Every time I looked at her, she was so beautiful I could hardly talk. Oh, my. See what I mean? Mama, you are gonna be the prettiest la.. Oh, my Lord. The ring. You just gave it to me, remember? Better get him out of here. I'll go tell ma we're leaving. Daddy never could get his tie right. Well, uh, I guess after today everything's gonna be different. I can't help thinking about you when you were a boy. So serious and dreamy. Always asking questions. Climbing the tree to dream and look at the clouds. John Junior, you turned out real good. I love you, mama. Ready? [soft music] [sighs] Ready? I am now. [female #3] Come on now. We're gonna be late. [pipe organ music] [music continues] [audience whispering] [bridal music] [music continues] You okay? I'm okay. Yeah, I'm okay.

Aunt Flo had more than redeemed herself. And the reception was just about the grandest party ever held on Walton's Mountain. It was a real combination of city and country plain and fancy.

Janet's father would be happy to know that in spite of some lean times' Janet and John-Boy never had to live on chitlins and moonshine whiskey. It was a fine wedding and the memory of that day is still warm and wonderful and will stay with us always. Goodnight, Janet. Goodnight, John-Boy. Goodnight, everybody. [all] Goodnight.
