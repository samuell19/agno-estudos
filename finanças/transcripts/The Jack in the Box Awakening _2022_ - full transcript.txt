[somber orchestral music] [crickets chirp] [Isaac] I trust the money is on its way. [Olga] Mm. - [footsteps approaching] - [door creaks] [breathes heavily] [whooshing] [Isaac] Here it is. The oldest Jack in the box... ever discovered. The original Jack in the box. I believe this is the very one you've been looking for. Yes. This is the one. Finding it wasn't easy. This box was linked to a murder case a few years back. Some nut in Hawthorne drove its value on the black market through the roof with his... ghost stories. Some sick-minded collectors would bleed themselves dry to get their hands on a thing like this. Thankfully, none of them have pockets quite as deep as yours. This will be a wonderful addition to our vintage toy collection. It will take pride of place. Mr. Huxley, can I ask you not to smoke that in here? You can ask all you like, but I don't take orders from the help. [Olga] Do as he says. Or that briefcase will get a whole lot lighter. [Isaac chuckles] I'm no servant. You sure fooled me. [door creaks] [footsteps recede] He'll get what he deserves. I'll put this on display. Leave it. I wish to be left alone now. All right. I'll take it down in the morning. Can I get you anything? - Goodnight. - [slow string music] Goodnight. Sleep well, Mother. [door creaks] [Olga sighs] [chain clinks] [suspenseful music] [Olga grunts lightly] [Olga breathes heavily] [box clicks] [Olga breathes heavily] [box clicks] [Isaac] Keys. Keys! [Olga breathes heavily] [box clicks] [Olga breathes heavily] [Olga grunts lightly] [box chimes melodically] ["Pop Goes the Weasel"] [music playing faster] - [thunder claps] - [Olga gasps] [suspenseful music] [Olga breathes heavily] [box clicks and squeaks] - [Jack snarls] - [ominous music] [whooshing] [thunder claps] [thunder claps] [floorboards creak] [thunder claps] [floorboards creak] [thunder claps] [Jack roars] [suspenseful music] - [Jack snarls] - [body clunks] - [thunder claps] - [ominous music] [box lid slams] [box grinds] [brooding orchestral music] [Chauffeur] It's quite a sight, isn't it? [Amy] It certainly is. - [keys clink] - [distant crow caws] [box crackles] It always takes them a lifetime to open these old gates. We'd break into Fort Knox quicker. [Amy chuckles] [box crackles] [Edgar sighs] [box hums] [lever creaks] [gates buzz] Here we go. [Amy chuckles] [brooding orchestral music] [birds tweet] [Amy chuckles] Welcome, Amy. Thank you. You must be Edgar. It's a pleasure to meet you. This place is incredible. It certainly is. I often forget how lucky we are. This has been home to Mother and I for 20 years. I'm not used to luxuries. She never spares expense. Is your mother here? I'd really like to thank her for the opportunity. She won't want to be disturbed. She's been bed bound for some time now. [Amy] That's awful. She has osteosarcoma. Cancer of the bones. The agony she feels with each movement, it's uh... I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. She's been seen by every doctor, every expert we could find. She was given roughly six months to live. That was five months ago. But I'll never give up on her. She's a fighter. I'm sorry. Where are my manners? Please, come in. [car starts] Your duties here are all focused on the general upkeep of the manor. Mainly cleaning and ironing. I'll brief you every morning with the tasks for the day ahead. Your room is on the first floor. The floor is shared with your colleagues, Janet and Frank. My mother and I occupy the top floor. We don't charge for the room, or even any meals you're provided with. You are treated in many ways as one of the family. All we ask in return is that you follow our rules, strictly. Have a read. I, uh, I think you'll agree the role pays quite handsomely. Quite? [chuckles] A nine o'clock curfew? No one comes in or out of those gates from nine PM onwards. I don't fancy your chances over those 10-foot walls, so please, make sure you're on this side of the gates at sunset and we won't have a problem. [paper flicks] Well? [Amy chuckles] [Amy sighs] Welcome to Rosewood Manor. Good morning, Mother. - Oh, my god! [gasps] - [dramatic music] - [door slams] - [breathes sharply] Mr. Huxley is dead. How? Who did this? This box, Edgar. It's not what you think it is. It was built to contain something not of this world. A demon. By opening the box, I have released it. And if it gets what it wants, it has the power to rid me of my illness. I will be healthy once again. What does it want? Six sacrifices. And I will live. [Edgar sighs] This is insane. This is insane. I need your help. Edgar. None of the staff are to leave the grounds. You must keep them here by whatever means necessary. To die? It needs five more victims. You must bring more to the manor. I'm not sure I can do this. We've done the impossible before. You're stronger than you know. Will you help me, Edgar? Of course I will. [dark orchestral music] You know that. [whisky splashes] [breathes sharply] [breathes deeply] [Isaac] Is anybody there? [muffled wind howls] [suspenseful orchestral music] You've gotta help me. Mr. Huxley? [Isaac] You've gotta help me outta here! I'm begging you, have mercy. [door creaks] [faint snarls and whispers] [box rattles] Open the box, Edgar. Why should I help you? [Isaac] Have mercy. I'm begging you, have mercy. Let me out, Edgar! Now! [tense orchestral music] [Edgar pants] [box chimes melodically] ["Pop Goes the Weasel"] Let me out! It won't open! [Isaac] Let me out! - [shrieks] - [Edgar gasps and pants] - [muffled wind howls] - [clock ticks] [Machine] The person whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please leave your message after the... [sighs] Come on. - [vase shatters] - [gasps] [Janet] That vase was only worth about a grand. Don't worry. I'll tell Edgar I did it. I've been here way to long to get kicked out now. Thanks. I'm Janet, by the way. I'm on housekeeping duty, too. Frank. I'm the chef. It's great to meet you both. So, everything all right so far? Yeah. So far so good. Where's the house phone? I just, I can't get any signal anywhere and I could do with making a call. [Frank chuckles] What? Uh... Yeah, there's no house phone here. And honestly, good luck getting a signal, 'cause I've tried many times. I just, I need to call my boyfriend. Well, my ex. Is there a computer here? I could send an email. Nope. There's no internet, either? Welcome to the 1800s, lovely. [chuckles] He's out of sight, out of mind. It's a blessing in disguise. Trust me. [chuckles] Check. [Janet sighs] Oh, come on. I've got you cornered. It's all over. Can I have a go? Please do. I'm not very good at this chess lark. Let's see what you got, city girl. - [suspenseful music] - [muffled wind howls] Oh, you're just gonna run around the board all night, aren't you? I'll be honest, you didn't strike me as a chess player. [Amy] Why? Well, you don't meet many attractive chess players. - Thanks. - [Frank chuckles] There wasn't much else to do but play games, growing up in an orphanage. When I started beating the adults, out-thinking people twice my age, it gave me the belief that I could plan an escape. You escaped the orphanage? [Amy] But I came straight back the next day. [Janet chuckles] [Janet] Why? I just needed to prove to myself that I could. From that point on, I was no longer afraid of where I'd end up. I took comfort knowing that if I ended up in a bad situation with a family that mistreated me, I could find my way out of anywhere. Checkmate. [Janet and Frank chuckle] Yes! I think she's gonna fit in just fine around here. Don't you? [crickets chirp] - Come on! - Shh, keep your voice down. [Frank chuckles] [Janet giggles] [Frank chuckles] [switch clicks] I hate those creaky floorboards. Are you sure they didn't see us? Yes. I'm sure. [creaking] Shh. [box chimes melodically] You're so paranoid. You look pretty scared, too. - [scoffs] I don't get scared. - [Janet chuckles] - Liar. - Mm-hm. [moans] [Janet breathes heavily] Frank? - What? - I can't do this. I'm sorry. My mind, it's racing. [Frank sighs] Fine. I'm sorry. Yeah. [sighs] Yeah. ["Pops Goes the Weasel"] [suspenseful music] [door slams] [Edgar pants lightly] Very funny, Janet. [heavy knocks] Open the door. [chuckles] - [box chimes melodically] - [eerie orchestral music] All right, this isn't funny. - Open the door. - [lights crackle] [door thuds] ["Pop Goes the Weasel"] [spring creaks] - [ominous music] - [Jack snarls] - [door thuds] - [lights crackle] [sighs] [heavy knocks] Janet, open the door! [door thuds] [grunts] For Christ's sake, you know I get claustrophobic! Open the door! Janet! [ominous tones] [flesh squelches] - [Jack snarls] - [dark orchestral music] [Jack snarls] [wheezes] [grunts and groans] - [Jack snarls] - [tense orchestral music] - [groans] - [Jack snarls] [grunts] Help! [box lid slams] [box grinds] [gasps] I can't do this. [gasps] I can't do this. [gasps] I can't do this, I can't... [whisky splashes] [breathes heavily] I can't do this. I need to talk to you! Mother! Let me help you. No. I can do it. Cane. [Edgar] How can this be? It has killed again, hasn't it? [Edgar] Frank is dead. [Olga] Every life the demon takes increases its strength. And as it gets stronger- So do you. [Olga] I'm another step closer. [groans] [pants] Have patience. You won't let me down, will you, Edgar? Hm? The demon must continue to get what it wants. We're gonna finish this. Together. I won't rest until it kills four more. Whatever it takes, Mother, I'm gonna keep you alive. I promise. [brooding orchestral music] [knocks] [distant dog barks] [knocks] [door closes] You should've told me that you were coming. Do you always wear that? Wear what? That perfume. I bought that for you for special occasions. Look, Edgar, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - I need to talk to you. - [suspenseful music] I have to tell you something. It's killing me, keeping it to myself. Please. I think you should look at trying to get some professional help. I've never seen you like this before. You used to be so happy and so full of life. I want that Edgar back. My Edgar. Not the one that she makes you. What do you mean? Look, I'm not trying to upset you. What do you mean? [sighs] I don't like the way your mother treats you. You've spent so much time caring for her recently, you change. The more time you spend around her, you... You become someone else. She gave up everything for me. If she had told the police the truth about what I did, my life would be over, before it even began. - I'm forever in her debt. - [distant siren wails] [Stacey sighs] Look, I think we could both do with a nice cup of tea. [Edgar sighs] [Edgar sighs] [Edgar sighs] [suspenseful music] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [Man On Phone] Missing me already, huh? Hello? [crickets chirp] - [pen scribbles] - [fire crackles] [brooding orchestral music] [Edgar breathes deeply] - [clock ticks] - [fire crackles] [distant bones crack] - [Jack snarls] - [eerie orchestral music] [distant bones crack] [Jack snarls] [sinister orchestral music] [Edgar grunts] [Edgar pants] [birds tweet] [water splashes] Frank? [knocks] You're really late. It's almost 7:30. [knocks] Frank's not here. He left the manor last night, so, I will prepare Mother's breakfast myself. [muffled pop music from earbuds] [creaking] [bottle sprays] [creaking] [startling chords] [Janet laughs] Your face. - That wasn't funny! - [Janet laughs] I'm just keeping you on your toes. [chuckles] What the hell is that thing? Some sort of antique Jack in a box, I guess. It's a new one. Olga's always had a taste for weird collectible stuff. Not much of a looker, though, is he? Look at those eyes! [laughs] I'm sorry, okay? I wouldn't have done it if I knew it'd bother you this much. I assume Edgar told you about Frank? Yeah. Yeah, I woke up to a note outside my door. [chuckles] He said he was missing home, so... Had he talked about leaving before? We talked about leaving every day. But we were gonna do it together. We were gonna start a business and secretly I hoped we'd start a family, too. I just don't get it. Frank hated going home. I clearly didn't know him as well as I thought. He didn't care about me as much as I thought. I'm sorry, Janet. Like I said. [chuckles] Out of sight. Out of mind. [footsteps approach] [curtain rings scrape] You are consumed by guilt, aren't you? We are on the cusp of a miracle, yet, you feel guilt over them. A salesman and a cook. [Edgar] They are people. Flesh and blood, like you and I. [Olga] They are nothing like us. What happens when people go looking for them? What happens when they come here? When all this is over, we will start again. Somewhere so far from here, no one will ever find us. We've done it before, we will do it again. But that's not all, is it? - I'm fine. - Don't lie to me, boy! It's that girl you've been seeing, isn't it? Hm? Stacey. [Edgar] I don't want to talk about it. [Olga] Oh. Whatever she's done, she's not good enough for you. - None of them are. - That's enough, Mother! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is all just too much. [Olga sighs] How did you find out about the box? How did you find out about any of this? Many years ago, I discovered the diary of the box's creator. He dedicated his life to the study of demons. The box was created to contain the most powerful demon he ever encountered. The Jackestemara. Jackestemara? "The Demon of Torment". If the box was built to contain it, why can it be opened? Because it was never meant to stay locked. Many have opened it, but I believe we are the only ones alive who know the box's true purpose. To make a single wish. A wish granted for unleashing the demon. A wish granted by the demon? [Olga] Yes. A reward for allowing it access to our world once again to find six victims. You asked for life. Why does the demon need to kill? It takes its victim's life. Their strength, their soul. Everything is transferred to the demon. But most of all, killing keeps its hold over Didier. Didier Dubois. Its human host. The creature was once human? Dubois was a clown in the Victorian era. For as long as he could remember, he was plagued with voices in his head. They demanded he kill his own family. They grew louder by the day. You see, the Jackestemara initially takes control of the mind. But it grows inside its human host like a cancer. Eventually, taking over the body completely. Dubois sought to exorcize the demon. But it was too late. [sinister orchestral music] It had already taken too strong of a hold. Dubois knew he was running out of time. The demon would soon use him to unleash unthinkable cruelty. To save his family's life and any others who crossed his path, Dubois demanded he be cast into the box. Forever. [eerie tones] [box lid slams] Dubois was betrayed? The creator wanted a child. A son God wouldn't give him. Once enough time had passed for the Jack to take full control of Dubois... [box clicks] The deal was made. [box chimes melodically] - The Jack was unleashed. - [Jack snarls] It claimed its victims. [box thuds rapidly] The first deal with the demon was complete. The creator was rewarded... with a son. [doorbell rings] [Edgar sighs] [Olga] This was never going to be easy, Edgar. But a great reward requires great sacrifice. [button clicks] [gate buzzes and hums] - [brooding orchestral music] - [car engine revs] [door opens] [door closes] Edgar? Are you here? It's me. Edgar? [ominous orchestral music] [muffled whines] [footsteps approach] [box thuds] - [chain clinks] - [Stacey breathes heavily] You were not alone last night. You're not as careful as you think you are. Even at my lowest, when I told you my mother was dying, you couldn't disguise your happiness. You were counting down her final days. Weren't you? - Weren't you? - [chain clinks] I thought you were the one. The one that I would one day share everything with. [somber orchestral music] But in the end, I want to thank you. For making me realize that she is all I truly need. And now Mother will always be there for me. No matter what. [sighs] Goodbye, Stacey. [eerie orchestral music] [chain clinks] [door slams] - [box clicks] - [box chimes melodically] - [box thuds] - [suspenseful music] [puppet creaks] [chain clinks] [blood squelches] - [sinister orchestral music] - [blood squelches] - [box creaks] - [suspenseful music] [muffled wind howls] [Jack snarls] - [sinister orchestral music] - [Jack snarls] [chain clinks] [Jack grunts and snarls] [Jack snarls] - [chain clinks] - [footsteps thump] Help! [Jack snarls] Help! Somebody help! [Jack roars] [birds squawk] Edgar's always been a bit unusual. A bit weird. [chuckles] Has he ever had a girlfriend? I've seen him with plenty women over the years, but, something's always got in the way. Or should I say "someone". He gets infatuated, but then she gets in his ear. I think Mrs. Marsdale is scared she'll be replaced. You should see him with a drink in him, though. He really livens up. Really? [Janet] He becomes an open book. One night, he even to... No. No, I can't. Oh, go on! [door creaks] [door closes] All right. [sighs] A few years ago, he got absolutely hammered and he started talking to me out of the blue about his time back in America. You could see he was out of control, but I just couldn't stop him talking. It's like he needed to tell his story to someone. Edgar's father also had a drinking problem, and was often violent towards Mrs. Marsdale. Edgar said one day he just snapped. He couldn't stand back and watch his mom being beaten up any longer. So... Took his father's gin bottle and smashed it over his head. He killed him. He was only 12 years old. Mrs. Marsdale framed Edgar's uncle and the two fled the country. I've always got the impression she will never let him forget what she did for him. You can see it in his eyes. The look of determination to make her happy. He would die for that woman. That's why you should never be afraid of him. Because despite what that worm wants you to believe, he has no power around here. None whatsoever. [chuckles] Only Mother... [chuckles] Drops the ax. But this stays between us, okay? I promised him the next morning that I wouldn't tell a soul. He literally begged me. - He begged? [laughs] - Yeah. He was on his hands and knees, right where you're sitting.

I thought this would help. I want to go home, Edgar. I want to leave today. What happened last night? I don't know how to, uh... Just say what's on your mind. You don't wanna tell me? I'm afraid you'll think I'm crazy. Try me. Last night, I... I saw... You saw what? I've never seen anything like it before. But whatever it was, it wasn't human. It was... It was some sort of creature. I'm not making this up. You don't believe me. Well... [Amy] Well what? It's not logical, Amy. But I know what I saw! - Are you sure? - [somber orchestral music] I... Look. Take the day off. Take the rest of the week off. Janet and I will cope. I'm sure the rest will do you some good. Now, Dr. Clarke is on his way. He's a good man. He's been a blessing for Mother and I, these last few years. Do as he says and I promise you, you'll be right as rain. In the meantime, if you need anything, anything at all, just shout. You're in good hands with us down here, Amy. There's no safer place to be. [footsteps recede] [brooding orchestral music] [Clarke] Okay. Are you taking any medication? No. Difficult question. No judgment, of course. Have you taken anything you shouldn't have in the past 24 hours? Recreational drugs are one of the most common causes of hallucinations. It wasn't a hallucination. [Clarke clears his throat] I'm going to give you... [dark orchestral music] I'm going to suggest you get plenty of rest. I'll leave you my card. My direct number is at the bottom. Please feel free to give me a call if you have any further problems or concerns. No matter what time or what the problem is. [briefcase clicks] Look after yourself, Amy. [footsteps recede] You didn't do it, did you? Why are you doing this? This is just wrong. - Why are you lying to her? - Keep it down. I'm gonna tell Amy the truth. [thud] I'm not gonna let you ruin this. Ruin what? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't go up there and tell her the truth. I wouldn't do that if I were you. [Clarke scoffs] You think I'm afraid of you? No. Not of me. [suspenseful orchestral music] But you should be afraid. Is that right? Afraid of what? [Edgar chuckles] You have no idea. Don't ever contact me again. [car engine revs] [dark orchestral music] [car door slams] Open the gate! Edgar, open the damn gates! ["Pop Goes the Weasel"] You think you can keep me here, too?

[Olga] He would've told someone. Somebody knows he was here. We need to finish this and get away, quickly. I've locked down the manor. This ends. Tonight. [crickets chirp] [door opens] [door creaks] [door closes] What's wrong? The doctor gave you meds, didn't he? No. Well, I think he was going to, but, for some reason, he changed his mind. I overheard something earlier that I definitely wasn't supposed to. I couldn't catch what they were saying exactly, but... I saw Edgar give the doctor money. He gave him a lot of money. It looked like he was being paid to give you something. Give me what? You think Edgar paid him to give me pills? The doctor seemed against what they were scheming with to begin with, but the cash, well, that changed everything. Oh, my god. Why would he do that? [keys clink] Something's happening here, Janet. Something strange. - Look. - [keys clink] It's missing. - What is? - The gate key! It's gone! Edgar's taken it! Well, why would he take that from us? I told him I wanna go home and he wouldn't let me, so he's got the gate key and he's locked it, hasn't he? [keys clink] Well, give me another explanation! [sighs] You can't, can you? My mind's made up. I'm gonna find that key and I am getting out of here. Are you coming with me? [Janet sighs] [keys clink] [keys clink] [lock clicks] Think, Janet, think. Where would you hide a key?
