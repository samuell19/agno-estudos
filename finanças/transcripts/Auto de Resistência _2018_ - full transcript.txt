There are no words, no gestures, nothing that can be said or spoken at a time like this. These are people You know by name, Lord, and in times like these, You look into their hearts. Take this family into Your hands. Take these five families into Your hands, Lord. No need to mob us, y'all. One at a time. They killed an innocent kid. These pigs must pay. We do have an education, and for this very purpose. Unfortunately, we were poor and lived in a favela. AUTO DE RESISTÊNCIA I was the first one to arrive. I didn't see anyone when I first got there because the lights were off in their car. They were crouching, hiding out of sight. So I ran after their car. When I saw they were cops, I put my hands up right away. "I'm a mother," I blurted out. "I live here!" "I'm not a criminal!" They started shouting at me. "Go back! Get the hell out of here, bitch!" "Beat it or I'll shoot!" "I'm not leaving," I said. "I'm their mother and they're not criminals!" "The kids in that car are not criminals." They kept yelling at me, but I inched my way closer. I was this close to their car, with the lights on, and when I realized they wouldn't let me through, I called out to him: "Junior! Junior!" I saw him move, and that was when I freaked out. "Have mercy, sir. They're alive! Help them!" "The emergency care clinic is right around the corner!" But he didn't let me. He let them writhe there in agony until they died. He didn't let me help. "They're just children," I said at one point. "Help them, for God's sake. They're not criminals!" But they wouldn't have it. One of the cops who was wearing gloves put the gun in the hands of the passenger, who was her son. Then he threw that same gun under the car's wheel. The car trunk was open when I got there. I think they meant to load it with rifles or drugs and paint them as criminals. The cheapest meat on the market is dark meat The cheapest meat on the market is dark meat The cheapest meat on the market is dark meat No forgiveness! No backdown! The police are killing black people! No forgiveness! No backdown! The police are killing black people! No forgiveness! No backdown!

Johnata is here! Johnata is here! That's what I'd be like when Johnata and I flew kites. "Careful, Son! Don't let the line entangle!" Whenever he got on the roof and took his kite up, I always said: "Let Mom get one in too." - We. - We. - Favela women. - Favela women. - From every favela. - From every favela. - Are gathered here. - Are gathered here. - To speak out. - To speak out. - Against the violence. - Against the violence. - Inflicted on us. - Inflicted on us. - Every single day. - Every single day. - Our unity alone. - Our unity alone. - Is capable. - Is capable. - Of ending this violence. - Of ending this violence. - Inflicted on us every day. - Inflicted on us every day. - We fight for us. - We fight for us. My name is Ana Paula. Ana Paula Oliveira. I'm 39 years old. And I was born and raised in the Manguinhos favela. Last year, my son became yet another victim of the police violence which is entrenched in all Rio de Janeiro favelas. I am Johnata's mother, and very proud of it. My son was just 19 years old and he had such a joy for life. Regrettably, however, on May 14th, 2014, just three days after Mothers' Day, my son headed out to walk his girlfriend home. He ran into a commotion where a number of officers from the Manguinhos Pacifying Police Unit were arguing with residents. Some of those officers fired shots into the air to scatter the crowd. While those people ran for cover, one of those Manguinhos Police Unit officers pointed his gun and shot to kill. My son was murdered at the age of nineteen. Shot in the back. Utterly defenseless. My life now is joining forces with fellow mothers. We're in this struggle, putting my son's name and my pain out there, calling out the love I have for my son, and seeking justice. Hey. You're Rafael's mother. God bless you. Finding all of you was so important. You have no idea the good that did me. It's been helping me tremendously. Fists up. Fists in the air. We are not a minority. How have you been? There are setbacks, as you know. But no way I was going to miss this. To be here for you. The accused, a military police officer, in sound mind, of his own free will, discharged his firearm at Johnata De Oliveira Lima, inflicting bodily harm which would cause his death, as outlined in the autopsy included in the report. The investigation report states that, on that day, Manguinhos residents were staging a protest against the actions of officers from the local Pacifying Police Unit, having been confirmed that the accused fired his weapon into the crowd gathered there, being held responsible for the ensuing death. At this moment, could you please tell us everything you know, heard or remember concerning these facts? Sure. On the day of the incident, we were at the location known as Coreia, at the UPP base. Two units were teaming up because we'd received a tip from a resident that narcotics were being stored at that particular location. When my unit and I attempted to leave the house, there was already no way to get out. Heavy gunfire was coming our way and at first glance, we could not tell where it was coming from. A great deal of rocks and bottles too, which were what they usually threw at us. Marcelino and his unit then showed up to give us backup and there was an intense firefight. When we were almost back to the police station, the 22nd battalion informed our supervisors that a wounded young man had arrived at the emergency clinic. We made our way there and officer Nicolau recognized him. "Larissa," he said. "It was Dokinha." That was Johnata's nickname. "Oh, my goodness! He's dead?" And Nicolau replied: "Yeah, he died." That was when we ID'd Dokinha. We knew he was mixed up with the Manguinhos drug trade. We were fine with that. We'd spotted him in the firefight, and that was when we learned he'd been a casualty. When the four of you were being fired at, were any police officers shot? - No. - Okay. Did any of those rocks and bottles hit you? They did, yes. Plenty of them. Were you given medical treatment for that? No, no. Did you personally identify Dokinha in that crowd? I could not get a positive ID during the firefight, no. I managed to ID only one of them, who was the one I fired at. As we came closer and saw the other dealers shooting at us, I could not identify Dokinha conclusively among them... Were you leading the incursion? Correct. You were leading the unit, but you did not see Dokinha. No. I was running. When our backup showed up, I was running for cover. - I couldn't get a good look. - But you were leading them. And as the first one in, you did not see Dokinha. No, I did not. You were armed with only a .40 handgun. - That's right. - How many shots did you fire? Just one. You described it as an intense firefight, but you fired just a single shot? From the moment I stop firing, there's no further need to fire blindly, risking the lives of residents and innocent bystanders. Thank you. Sign the document and you're free to go. Have a good day. We owe this mess to the intern they likely sent. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Have you ever been arrested or prosecuted? I was unjustly imprisoned, but by the grace of God, I managed to prove my... - Stemming from this incident? - No, sir. Due to a different incident. You may now offer whatever facts you deem fitting in your defense, please. We were in the container when we got word of criminals gathering at their selling spot and carrying out the sale of narcotics. Upon reaching the alleyway, we saw the crowd scattering. I personally spotted three criminals firing at Larissa's squad from a distance. That was when I fired seven shots and sought cover. From that point on, I heard no further shooting. You fired seven shots. Did you see if anyone was hit? No, I fired those seven shots and got down. It's split-second stuff. You can't shoot and then stop and see who's down or not. So you're saying you didn't hit anyone then. Actually, I wasn't even aware anyone had been shot. We only found that out 20 minutes later... So, at that point, you didn't see anyone down nor any trace of blood. No, no trace of blood. In your original statement at the station, you said you didn't fire your gun. Yes, sir. - Did it slip your mind? - No, it didn't. My attorney wasn't there and I worried they'd arrest me, due to that mistaken arrest on my prior record. - "Mistaken." - No further questions. - Take it easy, man. - God be with you. Care for a coffee or something? You get the idea. We're basically finished here. Now we move on to the closing statements. First the prosecutor's, then ours and the defense's, and then the judge makes his final decision. We hope he rules in favor of an indictment so we can move on to a jury trial. But he'll still be able to appeal. - Do you understand? - Okay, I get it, but there'll be no more hearings. No more hearings until the judge's decision. Let's keep our fingers crossed. We still have the closing statements to go and we're very confident, okay? As vice-president of the parliamentary commission on police killings on duty in alleged self-defense as determined by resolution 138 adopted in 2015. I now declare open this third session with the purpose of hearing Military Police Colonel Alberto Pinheiro Neto, commander-in-chief in Rio De Janeiro state. Police officers are trained with one reality in mind, but they must now deal with a new challenge. These are officers trained for crisis management, in more direct contact with the general population and these officers do end up in confrontations. In such confrontations, both officers and citizens are killed. In a study conducted by the Military Police, we note an increase in confrontations between different groups of criminals. Homicides due to police intervention represent just a small part of that whole. From 2002 to 2010... From 2002 to 2010, we registered approximately 10,000 police killings in Rio De Janeiro. These are staggering figures. No other country in the world can match the numbers tallied in a single neighborhood in Rio. The use of lethal force is not legal. To take a life based simply on alleged resistance to arrest is not legal. Such homicides could only be justified as legitimate self-defense. This brings us to the trickier matter. Police officers today always plead self-defense, always alleging that purported attackers were carrying guns and resisted arrest in the form of gunfire. This is the standard modus operandi in the officers' approach in such situations. I truly never imagined he would be executed on his knees, with his shirt stuffed in his mouth, by five police officers on a stairway. They called it resistance followed by death and said he was with a group of drug dealers. That's the version pushed by the shameless media. That they were a group of drug dealers who fled. And Hugo alone fell behind with a .38. That's a lie. There was no forensic analysis. It's all lies. The only truth here is that my black boy did time. He did, but he paid his debt to society. But that's no justification to take his life and tarnish his name like this. "Another drug dealer killed in firefight". They threatened the alleyway's residents, demanding a sheet to carry his body. The residents refused, so they started shouting: "If I don't get a sheet here, I'm coming back and you'll meet the same fate." Quite often, in what's basically the norm, this "resistance followed by death"... Let's say a police operation in a favela leads to 5 or 6 deaths. Very often, such "resistances followed by death" are only taken to court, and the investigations are generally wrapped up, if in fact an investigation even takes place, ten years after the fact. So paperwork stacks up, yellowing and gathering dust, and five, six, or seven years later, who'll be left to shed light on the case? How would I carry out a new autopsy to check the conditions in which the body arrived, when the body has already decomposed, and there's nothing left but bones? "Resistance followed by death" is a fallacious descriptor. What was once called a "writ of resistance" was an instrument, a self-contained document. That document settled the matter at hand. Well-drafted or not, that was the end of it. Rio De Janeiro hasn't worked with such documents in ages. That is not how we work in Rio De Janeiro. What we do have are police investigations. When you say "inquiry" or "it will be investigated", it gives people an idea that doesn't match reality, because 98% of cases are filed away. A police officer who kills and fakes self-defense is operating on his empirical experience. If he kills ten, or a hundred, and is indicted by only one, the odds are in his favor. When it doesn't go his way, that's an outlier. Fuck, look at the armored military vehicle. Look at it! Mow them down, man. Look at the EcoSport parked over there. Man, did you see the huge block on the Eco? That's the way the world goes to ruin. High beams. It's closed off. - Does it hurt, Chauan? - It hurts like crazy. Stay calm. Goddamn! Can't you get him help? He's in a lot of pain. Where does he live? Get up. - C'mon, get up! - Stay calm. Who's filming this? Hold up, I'm giving him a hand. They shot him! I'm helping him! Let's go, let's go! Get back. A policeman will come in here. Hold on. A policeman is coming in. Let's go! Save him! Let's go, sir! We can still save him! We're tending to him. That's my homie! Save my friend's life! That's my homie! Get in and let's go. You can't let him die! "According to our report, upon realizing that the victims were not drug dealers, the defendants seized two firearms, being one .38 caliber revolver and a 380 handgun, as if they belonged to the victims, spurring a police investigation which led to the arrest of the surviving victim." - Good afternoon, Chauan. - Good afternoon. What transpired that day involving you, Alan and the police? Good afternoon, everyone. We were standing right outside our house. The power was out from 8AM 'til around 11PM. That was when I got home from work. Alan dropped by my place, where I was at the time, and asked me if I wanted to hit the mall so he could buy some perfume. So we went to the mall. We bought the perfume and came back. Since it was really hot that day, we stayed right outside, goofing off with videos. So we were recording videos when Alan started clowning with me. Since there were no lights outside, he'd shine the camera light on my face on and off, and say "camouflage." I told him to cut it out. That was when I ran after him and heard the shots. What's yours, Chauan? - Get Chauan in the frame. - Achoo. What's yours? - "Choo." - Choo? Where's the joke? That ain't funny! I don't get it, but I love it. Get him in the picture. Where's the joke? - Serious face. - Down at the comedy club. Give us a smile. Camouflage! Camouflage! Right when we ran, I heard the shots and when I looked down, my chest was bleeding. The officer stepped out of his car and asked why we ran off. I told him we were just playing around. Were you asked to identify anyone in a lineup? - No, I wasn't. - No. Weren't you summoned to the station? Sure. I was arrested. Why were you arrested? They said there was a shootout, but there wasn't. You said that at the station, you didn't identify any of the police officers. Why not? Were you not shown a lineup? Upon arriving at the station, I was sent straight to holding. Good afternoon. Do you know why your son was arrested? All I know is that they planted two guns on him. He doesn't need any of that. We're poor but he has no need to mess with no gun. Do you know why your son was released? God's will and the attorney's help. But do you... And the evidence too, which cleared it up. Any particular piece of evidence? Sir, the piece of evidence that helped him, by the grace of God, was the cell phone video. Twenty years old, and he stopped by his mother's job to let her know he was going to the park. "Mom, I'm going to the park with the boys." It was almost like a farewell. I was at the store and he came along with his youngest brother. I asked him: "What's up, Junior?" "I stopped by the bank, and I just wanted to let you know that Keu and I are going to Madureira. Us, Wilkerson..." He named all the boys. Wesley said he was going too. "I'm picking my car up at the shop," he said. "You think it'll be trouble if we take the car?" "Just take the documents." "Okay." "Now quit shadowing me. Just wait at the counter." He kept walking after me up and down. I remember telling the girls he was saying goodbye. He went out to grab a bite and never came back. There was no operation going on. No police, no criminals. Everything was normal in the hills. They were just going out for a bite to eat. There were parties going on here and there. Things were just normal, but they were wildin' out. It's the chief of police, Mom. Hello. No, not Paloma. This isn't Paloma, no. It's her mother, Marcia. - How are you, Marcia? - Fine, thanks. No, I'm actually going to wait here. I'm close to where it took place so I'll just head straight there. It's easier this way. Okay? Did you notify your granddaughter's father? Yes, he's here with me. We're going together. All right. Are you on your way? All right. You're welcome. Good evening to you and everyone else, Ana Luiza. The reenactment should get underway shortly. The officers were waiting for nightfall to better simulate the conditions of when the crime took place. The witnesses will take part in this reenactment but the officers are not compelled to do so. Two of them have made clear they will not take part in this. The police hopes to clear up which version of the incident is accurate. The police officers' or the witnesses'. Ms. Marcia, tell us how it happened. When I got there, to roughly that spot, the officer said "back away or I'll shoot." "It's my son in there," I said. "Let me see what happened!" But he kept saying: "Don't come any closer." What about the gun? First he opened the car door. He moved the passenger, and then he put the passenger back in place. Did he take the body out? The body stuck out a bit, but he put him back in place. The officer took something out from back here. A black object. We took a picture later and saw that it was the gun. He put the gun under the wheel, right here. Here. Get back to where you were, ma'am. I'm reliving the whole thing. The officers are there in the armored vehicle. They're in the armored vehicle. - Who? - The ones from the incident. The situation got a lot of media coverage. In my personal opinion, this perimeter they set up is too shoddy. There are too many people here. They've been hammered enough. Why come back here? They're trying to collaborate. It's not about attention. None of the witnesses would recognize them if it weren't for the media. Two confrontations took place on the day of the incident. While the cargo truck was being pillaged, there were criminals in motorcycles giving them cover. The way it goes down is that they steal the cargo and take what they want, and whatever they can't load up is left to the community's residents. That was when the police unit showed up. Nobody was hurt in that initial confrontation. The criminals slipped away. As they rounded back, it all hit the fan. Sitting right here, but facing that way. - The body outside. - With the gun like this? No, both hands like this and pointing that way. As he ran by our vehicle, discharging the firearm, he kind of slipped. When I saw him on the other side, he'd already snuck into the vehicle. Good afternoon, Mr. Jorge. State your full name, please. My name is Jorge Roberto Lima Da Penha. - How old are you? - 50 years old. - Occupation? - Electrical welder. The place where they lived. Was it a dangerous area? Was there drug dealing around there or disputes between drug dealers? There are no faction disputes around there, no. If there were any faction disputes there, you wouldn't have officers holed up there, undercover. As for Wesley and Cleiton, had you ever heard anything about them? No, I have nothing to say about them. - Heard of them being arrested? - No. Mr. Jorge, I'd like for you to describe to us the consequences of losing your son at such a young age. There's nothing more painful than that. He was 16 years old. Already working, with so much life ahead of him. All that living to do. He was happy as a lark, working and studying. Home, work and school. That was his life. I told him. "You got a good thing going, Betinho." "Just 16 years old and you got a formal job." Here in Brazil, at 17, you can't get work papers, due to the military draft. He was happy as could be. Signed work papers and his schoolwork. He was very happy. And they took the boy's lives One hundred and eleven shots. They went so far as to shoot the roof of the car. Tell me. When you passed by on your motorcycle, you stopped and watched from where? On the corner. Come here. - By the second post? - Yeah, that one. My brother-in-law and I came back to see. You were watching from over there, before the walkway, at the second post. The second post over there. That's where you were. Okay. They said there were criminals shooting from the walkway, which would be around 120 meters away, and that some of them had crossed the train tracks. They claim they were under fire from people up on the walkway and criminals on the train tracks. What did you do during the day? We were hanging out at Madureira Park. What time did you get back? It was around 9PM. We stopped back home and got some money for a snack. As we headed back out, we looked around and saw the cop car. The officers came running and started shooting. Did your brother stop the car? They didn't even ask. They came up with guns blazing. We heard them shout out: "Yo, we're residents!" And they started firing at the car. Was your motorcycle hit? They hit the tire. - Front or back? - Back. When they called out that they were residents, did the officers stop shooting? No, they didn't. I speeded up and parked at a curve up ahead. I ran back and saw them closing in, still firing at the car. - You saw it happen. - Yeah. For how long were you at the park itself? We were there for a good while. - Around five hours? - Yeah. Why did you go back home before going out to eat? 'Cause Filipe Ret was playing that day. So we made our way over to the show. We chilled there for a bit and walked around the mall, and came back to the hills. You are here today giving your deposition. Have you been threatened by anyone from the police? No. You said you haven't been sleeping well. Has anyone come to your house to threaten you since then? No, but my friends keep telling me that when the police is running operations, they ask around about where the victims' relatives live. What did the officers do? One of them walked towards me and said: "Double back!" - Can I use his words? - Everything, in full. "Double back, goddammit! Turn back around! Double back the way you came from!" I had my ID out and told them I wouldn't leave. "I'm not leaving," I yelled out. "My son is in that car!" They're all young kids! They're not criminals! They all live here. I'm not leaving." He kept yelling out for me to leave and approached with his gun, going like this. - Was it a long-barreled gun? - No. It was a small weapon. - Like a handgun? - Yeah. He came right up to me. You're saying he pressed the barrel against you? - He sure did. - Pushing back with the barrel? Yes, 'cause I was pretty close to the car. Did you realize that on that same day, there had been a cargo heist, beer cargo, at the location of the incident? That the truck was being looted there? I don't know nothing about a truck being looted. I did hear about something going down, but that was earlier that day and it had nothing to do with the boys in the car. There was no way they could get that mixed up. You're going to do a lineup identification to point at the suspect who engaged in the behavior you've just described. - Is he going to see me? - No, this is a tinted window. They can't see you from over there, while you can identify which of them was wearing that glove. The guy in the orange shirt is the one who approached me. The one in orange? You mean number 1, 2, 3 or 4? - Which one's number 1? - The one on the left. - He's number two, then. - Two? - Yeah. - The one who... What did he do? He accosted me and wouldn't let me get close to my son. Was he the one wearing the glove? No. That would be that other one. Which one? One, two, three or four? - Number one. - Okay. You're going back a different way now. Going back now? Yeah, but she can't take that hallway now. - I'll take you there. - Pardon me. They can cut their hair and change whatever, but I'll be damned if I don't recognize them. Bastards. They kill five people and want to act innocent now. Real talk, let me break it down for you 'cause you won't get that on the TV the problem is not mine or yours it's ours, didn't you know firsts in the air, firsts in the air firsts in the air, we're not a minority the quilombo is here to say, the favela is here to say the streets are here to say that we're here for us the quilombo is here to say, the favela is here to say the streets are here to say that we're here for us We're here for us, yo! We want to see these cowards punished! It's the least the State can do for us. The bare minimum that this murderous State can give a mother who had her child taken away. They shot my son in the head and didn't even deign to come out of the car. They said there was a firefight at Chapadão. There was no firefight. They took advantage of the power outage, but my God is so good that the gas station camera caught the whole thing. My son was just fueling up. He stopped in his tracks when the police showed up, and without even stepping out of the car, they shot my son in the head with a 7.62mm rifle. Then they spun their own tale. Don't you think we're the only ones. That we're a rarity. It happens to all of us. Particularly black folk. Because this is a racist State. The Military Police is racist, even though most of their force is black. But they are trained to kill. They're messing with the boy, look. I heard the kid crying out: "Ow! Stop, please!" The cop is firing into the air. PT went away at 5AM He's lying there on the ground, man! The kid cried out. I saw it happen! The first shot startled me awake. - I heard it too. - The first shot woke me up. He was shot point blank. The boy is bleeding out on the ground! Look! Then I heard gunshots. We heard someone crying out. The boy put his hand up and the cop shot him point blank! Can you zoom in more? Zoom in. Look! They're moving the kid around. They're messing with the kid. They're messing with the kid. They're not looking this way. But there's another one down here. They're moving the kid. God, he was just a little boy! Yell out "murderer". My... My legs are shaking. Look at that. They're moving the boy. They're doing something with the boy. They came up the hill, and I guess they had a plan in mind. It was a whole bunch of them. Poor kid, he was running this way. I heard him. They're messing with the kid. I guess they're going to let the boy die. Look. They're planting a gun. Keep filming. I can post it to Isabele Benito's blog. Put it on Isabele. He's doing it. They're shooting. He's framing the kid. Right there, he planted the gun on the kid! No way. He put the gun on him. That's the police. - Don't say a thing. - Shut up. I'm not putting my face out there for them. Should we insist on the girl? 'Cause she's not coming. I doubt Jessica will come. On the recording, she talks to someone else. Another girl, I think. Who gave her account at the police station. She said she was hiding and didn't see anything. It was her phone, in fact. Do you think she will come? From what I've heard, they're both off the grid. There's no homicide here. If it weren't for the video, it would have been declared resistance followed by death. These are officers with one year... Not even a year on the force. The issue here is fraud. The one who planted the gun is the oldest, a corporal. - No, he's still a soldier. - But a more experienced one. With five years on the force. He was teaching the others. "This is how you do it." All I could think was: "God, if they hadn't done that..." The most absurd part of it is that it was impossible. When Siqueira got there, the kid was already dead, but he's being lumped in on this homicide case. When he got there, as Mr. Marcelo said, the boy was no longer with us. But he's been locked up since October as a result. - Good afternoon, Mr. Andre. - Good afternoon, Mr. Fabio. Can you please tell us what you know about the crime? Yes, Your Honor. I was on duty at the Homicide Division when the chief of police had the Homicide team head to the 4th Precinct to help with a homicide case... A homicide which had been delegated to their precinct concerning an alleged police intervention. The chief of police determined that the Homicide Division was to handle that particular case instead due to a video that came to light during the investigation of said case. A video posted on social media. The video clearly showed the involvement of military police officers, who plant a firearm on an individual splayed out on the ground and discharge said firearm. - Good afternoon, chief. - Good afternoon, Your Honor. What is the proper procedure to be followed by military police officers in case of alleged resistance to arrest? Preservation of the crime scene, and contacting law enforcement, sir. Should the victim's body be touched? No. Should they touch the victim's alleged firearm? No. - Good afternoon, Major. - Good afternoon. Was the installation of a Pacifying Police Unit well-accepted by the Providência community? As far as community policing, we have a green light, indicating good acceptance. As for security operations, we're at a red light. What does this red light mean? It means that at times, more forceful measures prove necessary in terms of police action. It means that the carrying out of police work presents a risk of imminent confrontations, putting officers and residents at risk. It also means that places we used to patrol can no longer be properly patrolled with what we have at hand. The young man who died, Eduardo, whose case is being investigated, do you know if he had a police record? Yes, Eduardo had been caught by another unit for drug dealing. We recorded video footage every day in that area, from numerous vantage points. I even had residents sending me their videos, and in many of the videos in our archives, we saw Eduardo working as a drug dealer. Are the accounts related here, of which you're being accused, are they accurate? No, Your Honor. Could you please relate to us your account of what unfolded that day? Around 8:40AM, my unit and I were patrolling the upper reaches of the Providencia favela, an area known as Cruzeiro. We heard gunshots. I can't say if they were shooting directly at the unit which made contact with them or if they fired their guns because they saw us coming. At any rate, we quickly sought cover. Then I saw the subject, carrying a gun. He had a black handgun in his right hand and a radio device in his left hand. - The subject being Eduardo. - Yes. I told him to freeze, but he pointed his gun at me. He meant to shoot me. Did he actually shoot? He pointed the gun at me, Your Honor, and I heard a gunshot. I didn't know if there were more criminals around. I called out: "Police! Freeze!" And he pointed his gun at me and I heard a gunshot. - You had a rifle, yes? - Correct, a 5.56. How many shots did you fire at him? Two shots, Your Honor. - Good afternoon, Mr. Eder. - Good afternoon. Are the facts described in the charges true? Negative. I was at the outpost at the time with my unit, three other officers, when we heard heavy gunfire. Upon arriving at the scene, I found a criminal shot on the ground. I turned him over to check his vitals. Since I could not detect any vitals, I reconvened with the unit and asked them what was found on the scene. Right away, officer Riquelmo opened his vest and pulled out a 9mm handgun. As he showed me the gun, I noticed that the chamber was halfway open with ammunition stuck in there, which can lead to an accident with the firing mechanism. Any contact is liable to set the gun off. I attempted to disarm the handgun. I removed the magazine and all the bullets turned the wrong way inside the magazine. I tried to disassemble the firearm, but my efforts were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the unit was under fire. I thought it would be best for the unit's safety if I put the gun in the boy's hand, so that in case it was set off, no one would get hurt. After all, the subject was already dead. Where were you taught that this approach was the proper one to address such a malfunction? Nowhere, Your Honor, but it was the approach I chose to ensure the situation didn't get any worse, and that no police officers would be injured. That was my only goal. By no means did I take this approach with an intent to mislead officers of the law. There's the bailiff. He just got here. The release papers! - Providência's got them. - They're ready? Yeah! Imagine the money spent by the State on this operation, which would never have led to arrests. I don't see any attempt to arrest anyone. Note that there are children in the area. They're running. There's one with a rifle the other way. - They're on the run. - Right. Who's running over there? Individuals running close to the armored vehicle. Damn it! Get him, damn it! Fuckin' get him! Reloading! Got him. Where's the other one? He's on the run! Cease fire! They're over there in the bar. Damn it! - That one's down. - Excellent. Looks like that one is a goner. Red shorts and dark shirt. I don't remember that one. He was with them, but not armed. If it weren't for this video which the officer posted for whatever reason, this Favela do Rola incident would possibly have been filed away. And why, you may ask? Because the information gathered by the police is gathered in such a way as to leave no choice. Who are the witnesses heard in these proceedings? Police officers who took part in that operation. Everyone with me, please. I refuse to be filmed. I'm warning you. There was no ill intent. We were on an operation, helping fellow officers. Doing what we've always done, but now he's being charged? This is grossly unfair. We're talking about highly-experienced officers. Dedicated officers with a passion for the job. There are two rifles in here. In that operation, we were dealing with armed drug dealers. They were all identified as drug dealers and criminals. No innocent person was hurt. We received no complaints. Drug dealers were the only ones killed. That was that. It was a regular operation. Did he have a gun? Let's do a quick count. Quick gun count. Aren't there any towels or sheets at the house? Turn this shit off for me. I turned it off. Careful there, man. The dead son of a bitch is still firing! Pull that trigger again and I'll shoot you. - Your pocket is open. - Huh? Your vest pocket is open. The right one. Let's hurry this shit up. There's another one here. These hundreds of cases classified as confrontations between police officers and armed criminals... This bears noting, because they're always labeled as victims. "Oh, the police killed the victims." How many of those "victims" were armed? If we're going strictly by statements from family members or fellow community residents, they were always unarmed and had signed work papers. Naturally, every case is a different story. These officers said, in their own words, not mine: "Lethality is encouraged." Yet when their actions become public knowledge, they're hung out to dry, punished and added to the statistics of duly punished police. That is, their position is that the police must confront them and when we get another police killing, they claim they're addressing police violence by pointing at officers expelled from the force. - Deputy. - Yes. Let me just clear something up for you which has probably been brought up already. I believe that Rio De Janeiro, since we got here, is the only state in Brazil, which tracks what we call the lethal violence index. It's no use merely giving an order or having the chief and battalion commanders simply tell their men "stop killing." What we need is the creation of policy which can reverse this situation. And that was what we did. We created a lethal violence index and if the officer maintains a good index, he is rewarded for it. How much longer can we go with the government agents, the Secretary and the chief of police avoiding culpability for these actions, very often incompetent in execution? If these people go on unpunished, when they're the real villains, even more so than the officers who pull the triggers, people will keep dying and countless cases will keep pouring in just like the ones we're sadly assessing today and like so many others which didn't make it here. Like so many others which aren't reported on and which we scarcely know about. The problem here is public safety policy. For years on end, Rio De Janeiro's public safety policy has been founded on principles of war. As long as such policies remain in place, there can be no solution. With regards to the policies in question, concerning the so-called "war on drugs", it's worth noting that just as professor Maria Lucia Karam says, war is not waged against substances or objects. War is waged against people. And the people against whom this war is waged are the same who are victims of police lethality. That is, mostly poor black kids from the outskirts. PEACE JUSTICE FOR AN ANGEL: JHONATA DALBER JUSTICE WE WANT JUSTICE I'm Janaína, Jhonata's mother. My son was killed in the Borel on June 30th, 2016. He was doing me a favor, picking up popcorn bags at my sister-in-law's house. When he left with the bags, he was shot in the forehead. Just one single shot fired by a Pacifying Police officer. Hold on. Give her a second. We're all here together. Jhonata is here too and he's so proud of you. It's your fight. You're your Jhonata's voice. He's here. Tell us everything you feel. Let it all out. You're Johnata's voice. I'm here today calling for justice. My son died nine months ago and I haven't seen any justice being served yet. So I'm here, in front of the public procecutor's office calling for justice. To try to understand why these people just sit on their hands and don't do a thing about it. My son was a good student. He was in 10th grade. I keep asking myself why. All I want is justice. It's the least they can do. When a cop fires a gun, it's the State that kills, because cops are trained to kill, so they kill because the State allows them to do so. If the State didn't allow it, they wouldn't kill. So the State is to blame. We're here today so that these proceedings are effective. As long as police are allowed to kill and keep working in that same community, looking into the eyes of the victim's families and intimidating these families, these massacres will keep on happening. Monday, April 17th, 4:20PM, exactly five years ago, those criminals in uniform, gainfully employed, took my son's life, allegedly in self-defense, against a pack of drug dealers who ran off and my son alone fell behind. That is a lie. I want proof. In these five years, no one offered me proof. And I'm here to demand from these criminals in uniform and white collars... They're murderers and criminals who kill with their pens and then say it was resistance followed by death The gun that my son was supposedly carrying still hasn't shown up. They shot at the boy 111 times. Riddled with holes. I got the kids out of the car, but they were already gone. And now the Supreme Court of Justice has determined that those five officers will await trial in liberty. CONDITIONAL RELEASE PERMIT Shot 111 times, two attempted murders, tampering with evidence and firing a weapon in a public road. That they're out on bail is an affront to society. We can't take this anymore. How do you explain the car being shot over 100 times with all the shots that killed the victims hitting them from the back? Can you explain why the shots that killed the people in the car all came from the direction of the police officers, being you, in the case? Was there anyone shooting from behind you? Or were the shots coming from the front? From people on walkways, holes or up on a roof? Did you have visual contact with the Palio at the moment when the shots were fired? Did you see the gun when it was found? Do you remember how far the gun was? Did ballistics confirm shots coming from your weapon? Did you fire at the Palio? Can you tell us how many shots you fired? As soon as I was made aware of the Supreme Court of Justice's decision, and the language of the decision in full, I didn't interpret the order as preventing the issuing of a new arrest. So on the same July 22nd, I called for the arrest of the four defendants again. That request has yet to be granted and today, as we bring the discovery to a close, I noted that what the four of them said during their questioning contradicts the evidence proved by forensics and ballistics reports. This shows that my request was well-founded. Therefore I ask the judge to process my request to have the defendants arrested. I'd just like to say, Your Honor, that a while back, I took part in a lengthy case and during the proceedings, I stated that when the media sneaks into court, justice often exits through the front door. I must say I find it surprising that a decision comes down from the high court and those responsible for administering the law then attempt to circumvent that decision. I ask Your Honor to respect this high court decision and do not allow this call for a new arrest. The high court's decision must be respected. This court overruled the arrest. Appeal their ruling, but don't come up with legal artifices to issue a new call for arrest. I'd like to ask for the floor, since I've been mentioned. I'm the guardian of the law. I was the one who put in that request. You need to interpret what is being ruled on before you start yelling and spouting nonsense. I don't spout nonsense. I'm not your daddy. You will respect me! You respect me first! And stop yelling at me! This is not the street market you're used to! Get off your soapbox! This is not the street market you're used to. If you have proper reading and interpretation skills, if you can speak proper Portuguese, then you'll know what to say before you start blabbing. I'm not looking to argue with you. Do you know my name? Ubiratan Guedes. It's never too late to learn Portuguese. Ubiratan Guedes, you hear me? Quit playing to the crowd! Quit showing off. Run for Assembly! It's never too late to learn Portuguese and study a little bit more. By Your will, Jesus. Father, take away this anguish. Take away everything that isn't part of me. I don't want to hurt anyone, Father. But justice must be served, because you are a just God. You are just, Lord. Thank you for everything, Father. All rise for the oath. In the name of the law, I vow to be impartial in my examining of this case and to announce your decision according to your consciences and the rule of law. What's yours, Chauan? - Get Chauan in the frame. - Achoo. What's yours? - "Choo." - Choo? Where's the joke? That ain't funny. I don't get it, but I love it. Get him in the picture. Where's the joke? - Serious face. - Down at the comedy club. Give us a smile. Camouflage! Camouflage! That was when I fell down and started praying, begging not to die. Where were you hit? On the left side of my chest. My cousin showed up, begging them to help me. They took me to the hospital in the police car. They got Alan in the car with me and took me to the hospital. What happened there? You ended up being arrested, isn't that right? I waited in the hallway at the hospital. I thought I'd be getting medical help soon. I stayed out there, bleeding out overnight, from Saturday to Sunday. Yes, but let me understand. You waited in this hallway, but you'd been arrested, on the spot, right? They cuffed me to the stretcher. What did they tell you? Nothing. I was begging them to treat me. Try to remember. I know this is a trying time, but what exactly happened there? He asked me: "Is this your phone?" My cell phone was in my pocket. "Yeah, that's mine," I said. I unlocked it and handed it over. He said he knew all about me, that I was a favela rat. - That was a different officer. - Right. - Not the ones in the car. - I'd never seen him before. It's ironic that for those of you who'll be judging this case today, it's your first contact with the proceedings. The Attorney's Office has been following it and had the opportunity to analyze the case. However, those of you getting to know the facts of the case today will be the ones deciding how society will respond to it, in the sense that you represent society. How will society respond to this type of incident? I'd like to show the video again and I ask you to note that the initial shots were fired intermittently, because the rifle has a mechanism which allows for that sort of burst fire. It is of utmost importance for you to notice that when the vehicle has already come much closer to their targets, which were the two boys, we get two final shots, at a distance allowing for far better visibility and where I see that there's truly no justified aggression. It was said: "I heard shots, I don't know where from. Then I shot back." "In which direction?" "Over there." "Why?" "Just because." That's not how it works. An officer with 20 years on the force knows that. Officers are called upon to reduce criminality, but one doesn't reduce criminality by spraying gunfire at walls. You don't. Did you hear the two final shots? Did you notice the break before those two shots? Did you notice their position? They're not facing forward anymore. Their visual is very clear and unambiguous. The individuals are lying on the ground and they're fired upon like so. They're fully aware of the situation. This is no justified aggression. The police car wasn't hit. There was no confirmation of a firefight. So they're in position and they shoot. They see the external image but notice the break... There are a lot of cases like that of Alan and Chauan, but in very few such cases is the evidence as definitive as in this one. We have the video, in addition to the police car video, which all police cars should have. There's a State law which requires that. We have the cell phone video, which provided footage from before, during and after the aggression. This evidence sheds light on the case and we believe that it will make your job much easier. Chauan, who also sells iced tea on the beach, was trying out for the Bangu soccer club and had his career irreparably harmed due to the bullet now lodged in his body. Apart from the medical complications, he's also forced to deal with the stigma associated with a gunshot wound. "A bullet in your body? You were shot by the cops?" Discrimination soon follows. "You were shot by the cops? What were you doing?" What we're judging here today is if the law applies equally to everyone. This would have never happened in other neighborhoods in the city. It happened because people ask questions. "Is that Palmeirinha?" "Is it inside Palmeirinha?" "Is it a favela or not?" What does it matter? It doesn't. It doesn't! Are you saying that life in the favela doesn't matter? That life on the outskirts doesn't matter? Can the police shoot first and ask questions later? That's what we're judging. But on the outskirts, in the favelas. This would have never happened in the Lagoon or anywhere in South Rio, apart from the favelas. On the outskirts, in the city limits, is the law applied equally to everyone? That's what we're judging today, essentially. I believe it was made quite clear to you that this community hasn't been pacified. Far from it. Residents will say it's paradise, naturally. I even mistook it for a vacation resort. "Casinhas." And don't tell me it's not relevant to make the distinction if it's Palmeirinha or not, because it does matter. It's important to know that it's not paradise. It's a place of conflict. The residents who spoke before us were disingenuous. For whatever reason it may be. We have men who leave home to get shot at in a favela without even a vest to wear because the Military Police doesn't have any in his size. Because he's too big. So what does he do? He faces these engagements without a vest, because he doesn't have one. He leaves his house every morning, with his wife and three kids not knowing if he'll make it back. That's why we've had 124 military police casualties. Human rights activists only genuinely care about poor black people from the favelas. Meanwhile, they vilify the police. What happened in this case, regrettably, was that he made a mistake. He fired his weapon and only then realized they were not criminals. Could they have been? Yes, they could. And if they'd been criminals, maybe he wouldn't be here. Picture this. Stand up, please. Look at the size of the target. It's easy to hit. You can sit down. Drug dealers are skinny, lanky and fast runners. Look at the size of that target. There's a lot of space around it. His perception at that moment was mistaken. "He's way too experienced. He couldn't have done that." You'll have to forgive me, but when the fear hits... I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. It was a fatality, indeed. But he owned up to his actions. Is he to be despised and labeled as a murderer? Sentenced to years and years of prison time? Should he lose his job? I'd say that would be going too far. What I'm asking you today is for you to acquit the sergeant. I trust your good judgment. I always trust the decision of the trial jury. Thank you. Let's move on to the vote. The votes are cast in secret. We can't have anyone here. We must ask you to stop filming. The audience and the defendant should leave. "I hereby grant the State punitive claim to sentence Ricardo Wagner Gomes for the crimes outlined in Article 121, Paragraph 2, Clause IV. Article 121, Paragraph 2, Clause IV, along with Article 14, Clause II, and Article 347 of the Penal Code. The sentence is as follows. In the case of victim Alan De Souza: homicide. Defendant's culpability is out of the ordinary. The use of excessive force with a high-damage weapon in extremely poor visibility conditions as well as the conditions in which the weapon was used, in a residential area, with no concern for residents or passersby, show indifference to human life. That is reprehensible behavior by the defendant. It would have been utterly reprehensible had the defendant been someone without the necessary technical know-how, and it is far more reprehensible for a public safety agent with military training, as the defendant himself made sure to point out, being a former Army officer and currently a Military Police officer with approximately 22 years of experience. Victim Chauan Cesário. The consequences of the crime are severe. The victim underwent severe trauma, being left to suffer while awaiting medical care. Furthermore, he was taken to the hospital with this dead friend on top of him. The victim mentioned a bullet lodged in his body, which complicates a potential signing with soccer clubs, which require physical exams, since it is associated with criminal activities. Therefore, with no further evidence, I sentence the defendant to 25 years in prison, two years and 6 months of further detainment and a fine worth 50 days' salary." We hereby bring this trial to an end. There's no call for celebration. Everyone has lost. The victim has lost and society has lost. A police officer has been put out of work. His career is ended. It's a sad conclusion, but we must enforce the law and show society how things should work. No voice is more legitimate than ours: the voice of the family! We who are suffering, who are devastated, with our families devastated. I often say that the officer who pulled the trigger and murdered my son isn't the only one to be held accountable. I've been saying this for a long time. The Secretary of Public Safety, the Governor and the entire judicial system have my son's blood on their hands, and the blood of all these other youths and children being exterminated. I cannot accept that my son died due to lying, exclusionary, racist public safety policy. I cannot accept that. We see that the Pacifying Police Units are all the same. They're all the same farce. In the first hearing in my son's case, when I found out that the cop who took my son's life and ended my own, had done a month's time back in 2013 because when he was off-duty... He wasn't on duty. He was off-duty in Queimados, in the Baixada Fluminense and he took five young boys to a vacant lot, and murdered three of them. Two of those boys managed to escape and identified him at the police station. However, that cop... That cop was tried in court, but the case was filed away. The case was filed! Due to a lack of witnesses, he walked away Scot-free and in 2014, there he was at the Manguinhos unit, where he shot my son in the back, completely defenseless! I cannot accept this! Us mothers, fathers and family members, we are sentenced to live the rest of our lives without our children. Meanwhile, these murderers walk the streets, free to commit new crimes. That is unacceptable! Unacceptable. They kill our children and paint them as criminals on television. The mothers and family members aren't even afforded the right to mourn them. All that's left to us is fighting for justice. But when we see other mothers and family members and learn about cases such as Mr. José Luiz's, closing in on the deadline on the statute of limitations. That is outrageous! It's unacceptable! We meet the mothers of the Acari massacre victims. I don't want to go through what those mothers did, who never lived to see justice being served. It's the very least that this genocidal, racist, murderous State owes us. All I wanted was to have my son here with me. That's something no one can ever give me so what we're demanding here, the bare minimum we demand is for justice to be served. This justice and its double standards which are always against us. This cannot be. Enough of this! Don't ask us to calm down, 'cause it's high time we stopped this massacre. At every hearing, when I see those bastards trying to incriminate my son, it's as if they were killing my son all over again.
