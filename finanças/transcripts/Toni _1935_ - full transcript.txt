Film restored and digitized in 2019 with the support of the CNC A true story told by Jean Renoir based on documentation gathered by Jacques Levert for his novel, Toni. The story takes place in southern France where, in defiance of the spirit of Babel, nature brings together people of all nations. He sings of joy And beloved independence And he says that freedom Will always be his true spouse And he says that freedom Will always be his true spouse Pass me the bottle. Let's have a swig. Another load from Piemonte! Plus the Spaniards who changed at Miramas. These foreigners are taking the bread right out of our mouths. And with this rotten lack of work. But you came here from Turin a year ago to get work. So? I came from Barcelona two years ago and I'm glad I found work here, for my children's sake. But I'm a worker. My country is wherever I can earn enough to eat. That's why you're so fat. Hand me the suitcase. You there! Your papers, please. - Which road goes into town? - Pardon? - The road into town. - Straight down there. - Goodbye. Thank you. - Goodbye. - First time working in France? - No, I've been here before. That's fine. - Fresh air here, eh? - It smells of oil. More than that. It smells like work. - You think we'll be happy here? - Of course, my dear. Under your balcony, my beloved I will sing to you tonight I'm leaving for France And shall never see you again And when I am traveling And have left my land behind I will never return to see Napoli Goodbye, Anne-Marie Because I'm going Goodbye to our sons and mothers Anne-Marie, don't cry If I am leaving Before I go I will send you a kiss Hello, Madame, I'm told you take in boarders. Yes. Do you have work here? Not yet, but I Will. All right. Go on in. Anne-Marie, don't cry If I am leaving Before I go I will send you a kiss END OF THE PROLOGUE - Up already? - Goodbye. Marie. Don't worry, I'll make the coffee. That's good of you, thank you. Toni. Come on, get up. It's late. - What time is it? - Six o'clock. - You could at least say good morning. - Good morning, Marie. No kiss? Well, well. There was a time when I didn't need to ask. You'd hold me in your arms and kiss me all daylong. I don't feel well this morning. Then rest. Fernand will let Albert know at the quarry. It's not that bad. It's just that I don't feel well in the mornings. I haven't been sleeping well. I toss and turn in bed all night. And if I touch your leg... it feels like you're burning up. And I'm sweating a lot. Look, my shirt is soaking wet. When you showed up here looking like a stray dog, my skin wasn't too hot then. You would hold me tight. The bed was too big for you even in summer. I know what your trouble is. You've had enough of me. Go on, nag, nag! I've had it with you making scenes. Want me to make a scene? You'd love it if I screamed and shouted and gave you an excuse to clear out. Well, you can forget about that. I can sense something's going on. Some woman is on the prowl after you. Could it be Josefa? She comes here hardly speaking a word of French and stirs up the whole hill. You're always over there. Or maybe it's Alinda, then? Well, you wouldn't be the first she's had. Alinda! I never even speak to her. Whoever it is, I can look after myself. - Good morning, Marie. - Good morning. How about this heat? I tossed and turned all night, like I was on a grill. Ah, Well. Marie. Come on, have some coffee, it will wake you up. I'm wide awake already. Did you two have another fight? - You bet we did. - When will you two give it a rest? Go on. Drink it while it's hot. Let's eat. - Toni! - Hello. - Your rabbit's a tough one. - My rabbit? The one you brought back yesterday that you got from Sebastian. I almost broke a tooth! Must've been a weight lifter 'cause it's a bit tough! It really is tough. Don't tell me you spend your time at the farm for a beast like this. If Sebastian's niece wasn't such a tender little chick, you wouldn't. I have no idea what you're getting at. Well, I do. Come on, or we'll be late. - What was all that about? - Nothing. Nothing. Hop on behind me and spare your legs. No, I'll walk. - See you later, Daddy. - Goodbye, Daddy. Work hard! Hello, Dominique. Going hunting? I'm looking for the thief who took one of my hens. - Up already, Sebastian? - You're an early bird. - All well? Been out hunting? - You know I don't hunt. - I'm getting grass for the rabbits. - Bye. - Going to the washhouse? - Yes, Uncle. Be careful with all the foreigners prowling around. Especially the Arabs. You never know what they're thinking. Don't worry, Uncle. Gabi. What do you want? - I don't like going to the washhouse. - Don't think that I'll do it for you. Could you see me doing the washing? - Help me pull the cart. - Oh, you have to be joking! Come on, Gab“.! I'd love to pull the cart, but Uncle can't spare me. I'm indispensable. - What did she say? - Nothing in particular, you know. - Did she talk about the little one? - A bit, not much. Marie's a wonderful woman. She'd do anything for me. She coddles me like a child. I feel miserable. She does too much! - Why do you let her? - It just happens that way. You don't know how lucky you are. If I were you, I wouldn't get on her nerves like you do. - Then do me a favor, you take her. - You're joking! If you were made a cuckold, you'd go mad with your temperament. With my temperament the thought of going to the town hall with all my papers makes me sick to my stomach. - Sebastian! - Toni! Will you stop by to weld the pipe? - Yes, but not before 5:00. - Good. Have you spoken to the other one? To Josefa? No, I don't dare. - You're scared stiff? - Yes. There's your Spaniard now. The way she acts, looks like she knew you were coming! It's terrible to see that. It's work fit for a mule. - Now's your chance to give her a hand. - I feel sorry for her. Watch your step, Toni. Josefa's quite a number and she knows how to keep men running after her. I only want to give her a hand. All right. I'll tell Albert you got a flat. Tell him whatever you want. - Off to the washhouse, Josefa? - Yes. Want to help? - Pick on someone else, I got no time. - That's not nice. Hola, Toni. Are you going to the quarry too? Here, take my bike. Muchas gracias. At least you're nice. This is terrible. With such a heavy load, my hands are all swollen. I'm sure I'll get blisters. It's awful. Why didn't you send Gabi to get me? You know I'm always willing to help. Yes. What about Marie? What would Marie say? I don't want her to scratch my eyes out. - Toni! - What is it? I'm thirsty. Pick some grapes for me, will you? They're Dominique's. He'll shout at us. It doesn't matter. He's not there. All right. You always say you'd do anything for me and then you grumble over getting me a few grapes. I'm not grumbling. You know I'd do anything for you. Here, wipe off the sulfates first so they don't do you any harm. - There's a wasp! - Don't move! Go away! - Toni, I think it's on my neck. - On your neck? Lift the back of my dress carefully and have a look. - Lift the back of your dress? - Yes. No slip. Can't you see anything? I can feel it moving. Oh, yes. It's coming up now. Don't move. Get rid of it, quickly. It's unnerving me, Toni. If I touch it, it'll get scared and sting you. Too bad. Go on! - It stung me! - It stung you? It stung me. It hurts. There, where my finger is. - I can't see anything. - What? - The little black point? - Yes, it hurts. The stinger's still in there. It'll swell up. I'll look terrible. - It hurts. - I need to cut it out. You're mad! Over my dead body! - Then it'll swell up. - Toni, do as you like. - Is your knife clean at least? - Yes. - All right. - Come and sit down. Kneel down here. Give me your handkerchief. I hardly felt a thing. - Did you get the stinger? - No. I must press hard and suck out the poison, but it'll hurt. Never mind, go ahead. Go on. Here. The stinger. That feels better. Do it again, Toni. There might be a little venom left. Un poquito. Toni, that's enough. You're taking advantage. Come on! Button me up and let's go. If anyone sees us, they'll tell Uncle we were fooling around. Dominique. - Josefa. - Hello. - Have you seen my kids? - Alinda is taking Estelle to school. Now he'll be telling everyone on the hill. But we didn't do anything wrong, did we, Toni? Right or wrong, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Very well. Have you paid your social security? Don't worry. We deduct it from their wages to avoid errors. Your card. - Italian? - Spanish. It's all in order here. I keep an eye on things. I'd rather be taken for a bastard than a fool. They know they can't get by me. But that doesn't mean I'm not fair. It can't be much fun here. - Easier than I thought. - Yeah, well. - It went very well, my friend. - Good. The difficult part now is talking to Sebastian. If all goes well, in a month's time I'll put the quarry behind me. I'll be harvesting grapes. If this weather continues, I'll have so much wine. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. We'll see how it goes. And while we're on the subject... you should talk to Marie. - It's of interest to you too. - Not easy. She'll start shouting. I'm afraid I'll be too blunt, I'd hurt her. But you have a way with words, you could bring it up. Don't you need to work today? Two hours late this morning and now you're holding a meeting. - Why were you late? - I was ill. I wasn't born yesterday. - Does Marie know? - Mind your own business! Perhaps you were chasing after Josefa? Leave me alone, it's none of your business. Wrong! It is my business so I'll give you some advice for free. I'm interested in that kid, so keep off my territory. That doll is my private reserve. Well said, Albert. Nice to see you're so sure of yourself. And what would you say to a little push over the edge? Why not try your luck at landing on those carts? Don't be scared, I won't kill you. But if you take Josefa, I'll do much worse. - Out of my way, you brute! - Go on, but stay out of my way. Listen, I'm not the sort to bear a grudge. You've got an easy job here. That's fine by me. But after work, keep out of our business. You can fool around with all the women you want, but don't try to steal ours. Yours! You act like you're an owner already. Go and see Josefa. See what sort of welcome you get at the farm! Dias mio! Dias mio! A whole afternoon's work! It'll all be dirty. Uncle will make me wash it all again. That's it, get mad. You're beautiful when you're angry. You try being on your knees all day long, your hands in water! Just look how chapped my hands are. You'll say they're ugly. You have lovely hands. They could use a manicure, that's all. I always look first at a woman's hands, and a man's shoes. Shall we pick up the washing? Fix the line first. - It's a bit short on me, eh? - Leave that alone! That's it! You're just impossible! - It's clear you have nothing better to do. - What - So that's the thanks I get for picking up your slip. - It's not fair. - Then why look at my slip? That's not what I'm looking at. It's what's inside. You brute! Keep your hands to yourself. You'd do better to help me fold those sheets, instead of talking dirty. Talking dirty? You're the one with a dirty mind. There. - Towards the right hand. - Right hand. - No, the left hand. - No! We need to work together. I'll do it myself. You're useless. How should I know if it's your left hand or mine? If you were a gentleman, you'd know it was my hand. You're so hard on me. You know I only dream of you. You don't believe me? Here. Feel my heart. If you're that unkind, you'll break it. Get back. Look at Uncle's shirt. - Take your smooth talk somewhere else. - Smooth talk? I mean every word of it. That's a good one. You're the biggest liar I know. - You don't believe me, so I'll go. - Go on, leave. Josefa, you hurt me. Go away. I've got to hang up the wash. Toni said to me, "You speak well, so be my spokesperson." Well, he's got a good job now thanks to the industrial development and the rapid progress - That's for sure, the region's doing well. We're second to none. When I write my brother in Segovia about the rapid improvements here, he refuses to believe it. And the air's so good here. Let me talk to him. Sebastian, you know I'm a responsible guy. It's about Josefa. Just talking about her makes my heart beat faster. I don't know how it happened. We used to laugh like kids when I came here. Then one day, I didn't dare take her hand. That was it. Since then I've got a heavy heart and there's only one cure. Won't you give me Josefa? Love makes even the mute speak. Toni, I like you and I'm glad to hear it. It's all right by me. We could harvest the grapes together. Don't worry, I'm not afraid of hard work. If all goes well with you here, you know the plot by the cypresses? Next spring, we could grow artichokes there. And I know someone who'll quit working at the quarry. I'd better go see Marie. I'm real happy for you, but how am I gonna break it to her? - You'll get an earful. - I wish it were over already. Think he can manage it? Yes, they'll be happy together. I'd like to see other places, you know. I'll take you to Paris when I go there on business. Will you really? Will you take me? - You've nothing on underneath! - So what? That's how the wash is done. My word! You're practically naked! I don't know about washing, but it sure can get a guy going. Very nice. I see you know what you're doing. You're hurting me! Why are you squeezing me like that? As if you didn't know. What's this on your back? Been fooling around already today? - But... - Who was the victim? A wasp stung me. Uncle took out the stinger for me. I don't think you've fully recovered. You need further treatment. No, I don't like that! She scratches! She's a fierce one! Listen, doll, get this into your little head. I'm not in the habit of wasting my time, and won't be made a fool of, get it? You're hurting me! Your uncle might show up. Quiet. Monsieur Albert, what you're doing isn't right. I think we could talk nicely and enjoy ourselves without - I see, gravy without meat. That's not for me, my girl. I love appetizers, but I'm used to getting a full meal. Listen, Monsieur Albert. These country bumpkins don't know how to kiss. Come here, I'll give you a lesson. Stay calm, it's for your own good. - Wait. I'll give you a hand. - Don't bother, it's all right. There's the girl's feelings to consider too. Go talk to her. She's doing the washing. Josefa. That's how it is, Toni. That's how it is. Josefa, you've hurt me. To think you'd give yourself to that bastard, in the ditch after kissing me so sweetly this morning that I thought we'd have a life together. And Sebastian, the old fool. He thinks he knows everything, but can't even look after his own niece. While he's talking like a patriarch... she gives in to the first comer. This gentleman rides in from the mountains and doesn't know how to talk to women. That's enough, you stupid bastard! No, Toni. They're in there discussing the value of the house, how much the vineyard yields, how many hens and rabbits, but where do I come in? You're part of the livestock. Charming. - Congratulations, cousin. - Thank you, Gabi. - I hope we'll get on well together. - Me too. What have you agreed about the farm? - Don't worry. I've seen to your interests. - I trust you, Uncle. Honest folk always come to an understanding. And you've got nothing to lose, have you? Now we'll drink to your health and to our agreement. Not that I'm all too pleased, but one must toast an engagement. At least everything's in order and that's the main thing. Don't worry, Albert. It won't hurt you. It's from my own vineyard. Our own vineyard. Happy because I love you My dear Maria Happy because I love you Passionately Your beauty Has wounded my heart Happy because I love you Passionately But look inside my heart Our love Its beauty has wounded my heart Toni, so as not to upset Josefa, to be good neighbors, we could have a double wedding. It would save money. Shall we? This little bouquet of flowers Which came from the mountain This little bouquet of flowers Which came from the mountain Long live the newlyweds! Don't let them get soaked As I want to give them away Don't let them get soaked As I want to give them away A good wedding is nearly as nice as a good funeral. - What's that? - Don't you recognize me? Gueroux. The funeral director. At your service. I'll give them to my dark-haired lad Tonight, when he comes to me I'll give them to my dark-haired lad Tonight, when he comes to me Say, know who I saw Saturday night at the café? Albert with that tall blonde who worked at the café in Aix. - I reckon they're sleeping together. - You think so? I don't believe it. What about Josefa? Josefa? He's unfaithful to her, especially now that she has a child. Two years of marriage are enough for a man like Albert. You know that tall skinny girl who delivers the telegrams? - Yes. - He definitely slept with her. Now that takes the cake! And then Sebastian's not well. They say he'll kick the bucket. - Know what people are saying? - What? He signed promissory notes that he can't pay. They'll take the farm away. Having an educated son-in-law can really cost you. That's for sure. Come. That's far enough. The stones won't reach us. - No harm pushing it further. - It's safe here. If poor old Sebastian dies, what will become of Josefa? I don't know. Do you really think Albert would leave her? What a bastard! That fuse sure is taking its time. Say, if there was 100,000 francs up there, would you go get them? - Sure. Won't go off for a while. - Oh, no? He's a bit cocky, isn't he? I wouldn't, it's on a short fuse. What wouldn't we do for 100,000? Do you really think he'd walk out on Josefa? Poor devil! 100,000 francs? I wouldn't go looking for them. What weather! Just when I got out my good shoes. - The old man isn't in his vineyard. - That's what keeps him going. Ever since he fell ill, it's all he can think of. Never mind. Come on. Let's go in. I want my little niece to be baptized before the end of the week. It doesn't matter whether I'm dead or alive. You can't refuse me that, Toni. - Why Toni? - I only trust him. Don't flatter me. Don't take offense, my poor Albert... but you don't know our country ways. At the sound of your footsteps, the land stops producing. - But Uncle - - Please be quiet. Your words won't change a thing. My dear Toni, you must be godfather to Josefa's daughter. But being a godfather is no small thing. For us Christians it's more than the father. Charming! And what does that make me? Don't worry, Sebastian. I'll do whatever it takes and look after the child like my own. No, no. Excuse me. Just one question. Is the child mine or Toni's? You're making me look like a fool. - That's nothing new. - Yes. Albert's right. He should look after his own daughter. It's not our business. I might have children too. Quiet, Marie. Sebastian, you have my word, if anything happens, I won't let Josefa down. Here we go again. Toni, dear Toni. My uncle is dead. I'm all alone. No, you're not alone. I'm here. I'm all alone. It's over. Josefa! Have you no shame? - There's no harm in it. - Go home. - I want to see Sebastian. - No! Come home. Fine. We'll go home! Is my jacket ready, Marie? What does it matter? You're not going out. My old friend's being buried and I can't say goodbye? Your old friend can do without you for a change. Let me go, Marie. And remember what the old man said about the baptism? A father. You have a father's responsibilities. They stick a kid in your arms, so now it's up to you. It's not yours, but never mind. If the parents go broke, never mind, Toni will provide. Do you expect me to put up with this? It's a promise, Marie. I must respect the dead man's wish. Otherwise I'll be cursed. Was it the wish of a dying man for you to kiss Josefa too? - You hypocrite! Liar! - You're right. - Are you happy? - About what? - The funeral ceremony. - The funeral drapes were moth-eaten. It's the weather. We can't change them every month. - So you do nothing about it. - We must talk about the bill. We'll see tomorrow. I'm not discussing this today. It's an emotional moment, I understand. I'd rather jump down a well than see you with those people. Go to hell, Marie! Go ahead, insult me! Why not hit me too? Might as well go all the way. In my shoes, plenty would. Yes. Don't you worry about me. Clear off, if you like! And don't forget to take your gun with you. Give me my jacket. I'm going to the cemetery. I'll have the little one baptized tomorrow. Take a look at your jacket. Fate has spoken. - I'll wear my old one! - Toni. I'm warning you, if you walk out this door... Dirty swine! - You dirty swine! - I'm going, Marie. After a scene like that, I don't know if I'll be back. Toni! Toni. I love you, Toni. You mustn't leave me. You won't find anyone who loves you more than I do. I know... it's wrong of me to make a scene. I won't do it again, I promise. There now, Marie. I don't intend to leave you. You just got me a bit riled up with all your shouting. You go back home and get some rest. I'll go to Sebastian's funeral and you'll feel better by the time I'm back. I'll have the child baptized, then we'll put all of this behind us. You're heartless! All right, go to the funeral. Arrange for the baptism. Go take back your Josefa. Go pray for your dear Sebastian, who took advantage of you in life and who still comes between us even after death. Go on! But you'll be sorry. I know what I have to do. Do what you like, just stop screaming. I can't stand to hear your voice. Soon enough you won't hear it again. And afterwards you'll say... "It was fate." Where are you going, Marie? Do you remember the kittens you drowned in the pond last year? That did something to you. It's terrible to take a creature's life. Now you're pushing me under as wickedly as you did the kittens. - Over already? - Yes. Why didn't you come? I didn't feel too well. A made-up illness. Another fight with Marie. Yes, but - - Bye, Toni, Fernand. - Come here. We fought like cats and dogs. It was like before we were married, when she ran to the police to keep me from marrying Josefa. Always the same. You're both pathetic. You're a good guy, and you know how I feel about Marie. But you weren't meant for each other. You'll wear yourselves out fighting and die too young. Where's Marie? She threatened to drown herself. No chance I'll fall for that. Women! The more they love you, the tighter they cling. Toni. Did she really say she'd drown herself? That and plenty more. My ears are still ringing from it. Let's go and see where she went. She might just throw herself in to spite you. - Which way did she go? - Through the little wood. - That way. - Let's go and see. Toni, you go that way. I'll go towards the cove. Marie! Marie! Let's go! Toni, look what you've - He's been waiting for this for ages. Mornings when I work in the fields, I hear them fighting all the time. I don't believe that. I know Toni, he's my mate. So you're here. Why did you do that, Marie? It could've been the end of you. You gave us a real scare. The main thing is, you're alive. Leave me alone. We must get her into bed now or she could get pneumonia. No, not you. I don't want to see you again. Go to Josefa or whoever... but don't come back to my house. That's very serious, Marie. I can't believe you really mean it. I'll come to the house this evening, you'll see. Go away, Toni! Help me out. Poor guy. It's me, Marie. It's me. No, Toni, it's over between us. You don't want me to come back? No. Thank you, Marie. What will you do? I'll go up the hill to the charcoal burners' hut. Go on then. I'll come to see you. If you want. Fernand? - Do you need anything? - What are you doing? Nothing... I'm a bit hungry. - What are you hiding in your pocket? - A bit of bread. It's for Toni, isn't it? He's out in the woods. He must be starving, you know. Take a liter of wine too. You're very good, Marie. God help us. But what can we do? Tell Toni to come back. No. It would just start all over again, and this time it would cost the both of us our lives. You were lucky to come out of it all right this time. It's so hard to call it quits. You see, it nearly cost me my life. But once it's done, it's best not to turn back. Take a blanket too. I don't want to see him again, but I wish him no harm. When he goes by And when he returns He always has his razor in hand And if it strikes his fancy. . . My friends, have you seen Toni? He's over there. If you're looking for conversation, you're better off with us. - We'll help you drink that bottle! - You've already had enough. I'll bet Toni hasn't had a thing all day. We invited him to join us, but he didn't even answer. When he goes by And when he returns He always has his razor in hand And if it strikes his fancy My goodness He gives me quite a shave - Evening, Toni. - Hello. Didn't you go to the quarry today? - What's the point? - To eat. You bring me food and if you stop I'll get it elsewhere. - Right. You mean you'll steal it? - Yes. - What if someone stops you? - They'd better not. You can't stay here forever. What do you do here all day long? That's none of your business. All right. If that's how you feel, goodbye. - Listen, I'm very busy. - Doing what? A hunter lying in wait for a partridge is busy too, even though he looks idle. Are you waiting for Josefa? Come here. - See that light in the farmhouse? - Yes. I can see every movement they make. Left of the gate is a little path which lies at the base of this hill. Stretch out your arm and you can almost touch it. One day, she'll come down that path... to gather pine cones or sage or rosemary. Tomorrow, or maybe next week, or even later, I can wait. - Then what? - Then I'll take her. But she's married, pal! You're forgetting about Albert. - Albert doesn't count. - Suppose she doesn't want to? She will. I'll make her understand she has to leave him. She'll bring the child and I'll be godfather as Sebastian wanted. She'll take my arm, I'll put her in the side-car. And we'll go to Marseilles to catch the boat. She won't be able to refuse me. On the 23rd of June How will I remember it I could say that in my house The swollen river Has swept everything away You've been waiting for your Dulcinea for two years. The woodcutters are right, you're mad. And how long have you been waiting for Marie? Marie? Marie is a real sorry sight now. The shepherd came to treat her with his herbal remedies from the mountain. He says you're the one who's sick. He asked me for your date of birth, then looked up at the sky. The sky! I look at it all night and I can't take my eyes off it. Maybe because I won't be seeing these skies much longer. Josefa and I will go to South America we'll have another sky over our heads. They don't have the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper and all that. We'll have a new life, under different stars. Impossible dreams, Toni. Your head's up in the clouds. You'll end up falling down and breaking your neck. Come back down to earth, put your feet back on the ground of our dear old hillside. I am on our dear old hillside. I can even see Sebastian's house from here and the light of Josefa's window. - Forget her, Toni. - Forget her? You'd laugh if I wanted to graft a plane leaf onto an olive tree. That's exactly what you're asking me. Here. Have a drink, it'll do you good. Say, it seems that ships bound for Argentina have four smokestacks. No, three. Got enough money for the fare? If need be, I'll ask you for help. My old friend. Have a drink now. You there! Tell me where my daughter is or I'll bust your faces with my stick. - What daughter? - My daughter Alinda. You lured her up here to have a good time. You rogue! This rogue will kick you in the rear, you puffed-up so and so! If you come bothering Toni, I'll beat you to a pulp! - To a pulp? - I'll beat you to a pulp. Did you see that? Come on. Here. Wrap yourself in this blanket and try to sleep. If you have anything to tell me, tap on the shutter three times. Then I'll know it's you. Well then, good night. Thank you, Fernand. You spend your time at the quarry and you get paid for your work. You bet. I'm no philanthropist. Meanwhile, I bust my hide growing tomatoes and tending the vines. Someone has to do the work. If you don't like it, hire a laborer. - And you'll pay for it? - Don't be childish! A laborer earns 3.50 francs an hour, plus food and wine. Since I'm doing the work, I should get the going rate! - You get fed. - And you don't eat? You won't even get a blister from the little work you do. - You won't pay me a wage? - No. Right. And the debts for the tractor and the water pump? - Who's paying them? - I am, from the farm income. So as half owner of the farm, I pay half of the debts. Obviously! Your modern ideas mean I see the fruit of my labor slip through my fingers? I've had enough. Who signed those notes? Did you? Yes, along with Uncle Sebastian. Accept the inheritance and the debts, or give up your inheritance. Give up my inheritance? Are you mad? Then you have to pay too. Make some room, Albert. For heaven's sake! Ratatouille again! Tomatoes and peppers. You know I hate it. - The garden's full of them. - I don't care! Now that I'm in charge, vary the menu a bit. No more of this peasant food! - Open a tin of sardines. - As you wish, Albert. How I miss a good steak like back in Paris! - Look, Albert... - What? This will never work with two masters. Give me some money and I'll beat it. Where would I get any money? You were paid for the harvest this morning. - You owe me half. - I owe you nothing. That's enough! I'm keeping the money to spend on the farm. And maybe to enjoy yourself in town? Why all these insinuations? I know what's up here. The two of you have cooked up a nice little plot. But it won't work with me. Here's my money. - Our money. - If you like. Now watch this. I make a hole, thread some string... I've broken the key to the can. I don't care. Use the pliers and get a move on. Now, come and get it, if you dare. And don't forget my little pal here. -6.35 mm, and I'm a crack shot. - I cut myself. - I don't care! - You brute! Try to be polite. Don't take that tone with me. You two are getting on my nerves. That's what I get for being too kind. But just you wait! I'd rather be taken for a bastard than a fool! You're right, Gabi. It won't work out with two masters. I'll show you who's boss. The boss, the one and only! A master who picks the pockets of two poor orphans. That's enough! Get that beast out of here. Beast? You call her a beast? May god punish you for such cruelty. God has better things to do than worry about you. Get out of here! I've had enough too. I'll see to the animals as I'm conscientious. And then I'm off. Clear off, it's best for you. I'm done living with a raving lunatic. It's too dangerous. - What is it? - I'm leaving. It's impossible now. You said it. He robs us of our livelihood, he's a madman and he'll kill us. Isn't that enough? The only way to save our skins is to clear out. - What a shame. - Yes. Don't worry, little cousin. I'm here, I'm your cousin, your friend. You just have to cut the string round his neck. Try to do it in the early hours without waking him. He's too worked up now. He'll take a while to drop off. Put some scissors under your pillow. - He might kill me. - No, don't worry. - But I'm afraid. - You must choose. Albert or me. Albert. It sickens me to think of climbing into his bed. Then do it for me, for us, for your daughter who he'll end up striking down when he's drunk. I'll go up the hill and wait for you by Toni's hut. I'll nab his motorbike to get us to Marseille. After all, he is the girl's godfather. It'll be his present to us. And what will we do after that? That depends on what's in that wallet. I'll see you up on the hill. Why can't you stay? He might wake up. Then all I can do is pray. İf I stay, it could get real nasty. You'll come up with something on your own. You're a woman, aren't you? That swine came looking for his daughter. If that isn't outrageous... Looks like the fun's over. I came here because I'd rather see your godforsaken face than none at all. Know what I mean, Toni? - What are you doing here? - Taking a stroll. - What about sleeping? - It's of no interest. Can you make some room by the fire? It's pretty cold out. - Sit here. I'm going to sleep. - Go and sleep. That's good of you, my friend. - Don't sit on the guitar. - Don't worry. Tickle him. Let's see what he looks like when he laughs. What's up, Toni? Never been better. Well, if you look like that when you're happy, I wouldn't want to see you when you're sad. Why aren't you at home? I had a fight with Albert, so I'd rather stay away. - You're afraid. - Me? No, I'm not afraid. I'd just rather keep my distance. - And Josefa? - She knows nothing about it. I'm sure she's sound asleep now. But I can see a light in her room. Maybe the kid woke up. Did Josefa hear you fighting with Albert? No, and it doesn't concern her. It was about the inheritance. I'm going to sleep too. Good night all. In the middle of the sea is a boat That waits for the wind In the middle of the sea is a boat That waits for the wind to sail away Where are you going, Gabi? Why are you making off with my bike? You could have asked. - I'll return it tomorrow. - I can't lend it to you today. Maybe tomorrow, or later. I'll even give it to you. I need it today. I'm waiting for Josefa. - Josefa? - Yes. I'll tell you. She'll be here any minute. - We're leaving the country. - Leaving the country? Yes, we can't take it with Albert anymore. I don't quite understand. You're leaving, Gabi. All right. But why is she going with you? She's my mistress. We've been lovers for two years. Two years? Since just before the thing with Albert. - She's going with you? - Yes, sir, with me. It won't be much fun for me, what with the kid and all. But I can't just leave her, it's a matter of honor. - And it's a matter of money too. - Money. Here's the plan. Albert keeps his money on him at all times, even when asleep. She'll grab it when he's fast asleep and we'll both clear out. It's not stealing, it's our poor uncle's money. That's why we need your bike. You wouldn't deny us that, would you? And what if Albert wakes up? Well, then I'd rather be up here than down there. Do you think I'd let Josefa live with a lowlife like you? For a thief, you're naive. She will leave this place, but not with you, with me. That's a good one. You can go ask her and see how she answers. We'll go right now! I'll tell you this 'cause I'm your friend. Doesn't it bother you to get to her after Albert and me? I couldn't give a fuck! It bothered me with Albert back then. Maybe I loved her less than I do now. But now if you told me she'd gone totally wild, I wouldn't care! Toni, come back! Don't go. You'll wake Albert with those clodhoppers of yours. And if he wakes, I don't want to think what could happen to her. Think I'll stay here and listen to your fine words while she risks her life to get money for you. If she gets hurt, you'll have to answer to me. That's my money you've got. Never mind, do what you like. Don't kill me! It's not worth it. You just need to be taught a good lesson, that's all. No, Albert, don't hurt me, I beg you! I'll work hard for you like a wretch. You're a real fool to think you'd get away with that trick. I hope you've learned your lesson. Josefa, put that down! After all, I haven't done anything to you. Let's go see. If it's her... Let go! You're not gonna kill me, eh? If it's her, I'm not sure if I'll let you go. Toni, let me go! Toni, let me go! No, Toni! Thank God! Everything all right? You poor girl. Did he hurt you? Shall we go, Gabi? Hold on a minute. It's not like the house is on fire. Fire? No, there isn't a fire. Unfortunately, it's something else. He's so big. He seems even bigger now that he's dead. Where are you going, Josefa? My dear Toni, I'm going away with Gabi. I must get my child dressed and pack a few things. Give me that. Listen, Toni. You were right, you know. She's not meant for me, she's for you. You two will make a nice couple. A couple in an unusual situation, of course. But I should step aside. My place isn't here. Besides, the air around here doesn't suit me anymore. It really doesn't agree with me. There's a strange smell to it, like the smell of forced labor. You always talked about seeing the world. I think the time has come for me to go. I'd be grateful if you didn't mention that I was here this morning. I'm the modest sort. I don't like attention. I don't need to see my picture in the paper. Goodbye then, Toni. Until we meet again. I hope it's in some other country. I forgot my money. It's not like I need it, but I can't live on thin air. Listen, Gabi... - Still want the bike? - More than ever. - I'll give it you on one condition. - I got it. It's that I never come back here again. I'm a tactful person, and I'm happy to help you both. Tell Josefa that I'm sorry to leave without a kiss. You can give her my best wishes. Goodbye, Toni. Where's Gabi? Gabi's gone. Gone? He's gone? - He's left me! - Yes, he's left you. - Didn't he say anything? - Nothing much. It's horrible. Nobody would abandon an animal like this, but he leaves me with this dead man, heading towards disaster. Dias mio. What will become of me? Why didn't you say you needed money? Is that why you killed him? That beast! - I wish I'd killed him myself. - It's nothing. The trouble is that the neighbors will find out. Then I'll be arrested and they'll take away my daughter. No, Josefa. We'll put Albert in the cart and hide him under all the dirty washing as if we're off to do the wash. People won't wonder. They've seen us on the way to the washhouse before. Remember that day with the wasp? Yes, Toni, I remember it. I'll leave his body in the bushes in the woods with the gun beside him. People will think he shot himself because of his debts. - You carry on alone. - Yes, Toni. You will be brave? If we run into anyone we'll pretend to be lovers. We'll pretend. Toni, why are you doing this? You're risking your life, you know. I gave my life to you long ago. Here, take the gun in your right hand. There. Just like that. You're not talking, Albert. You're right to keep quiet. Josefa is mine. Mine. - What are you doing, Toni? - Me? Nothing. Did you kill Albert? Yes, I did. You can arrest me. I'll come with you. - But I'm meeting someone... - Those days are over. But it's important to me. Hurry, it's another three kilometers to the village. - Damn it! He's run off! - Who? - The murderer... - What murderer? - Toni killed Albert. - Well! I'm not surprised. Lend me your bike. I'll hurry to the police station. You guard the body. It's over there by the bushes. - Don't let anyone near it. - You can count on me. - Heard the news? - What news? Josefa, something awful has happened to your husband. My husband? Yeah, Toni has murdered him. My daddy has gone with the police to arrest him. Josefa? Let me go, Alinda. I know what I have to do. Where are you going, Josefa? I don't want Toni to pay for a crime I committed. I'm turning myself in. Let's go back, Marie. Marie, I'm going to the station to warn Toni. Maybe it's not too late. I doubt he'll come this way, but since you're here to help, stand guard right here. If you see him coming, fire a shot in the air, just to warn us, of course. Don't worry. He won't get past me. - We'll go to the station. - If you like. Toni! - Stop, Toni, or I'll shoot! - Let me by. Toni, my old friend... It hurts you when I move. I won't do it again. Rest your head on my arm. Breathe slowly. It's me, your old friend, Fernand. Josefa. Don't worry about Josefa. I saw her with her child in the woods this morning. She doesn't suspect anything. No one does. You're in pain, Toni. Oh, dear. Think of her. That will ease the pain. If she was here, she'd take you in her arms. She'd stroke your hair. You don't answer, Toni. Speak to me. Tell Josefa I won't be able to meet her. Toni, my poor friend. You, too, arrived three years ago, so full of hope.
