Flight to Mars (1951) Mars... They'll be leaving day after tomorrow. I wonder if they'll make it! And what they'll find if they do. Life maybe. Life of some sort. Perhaps someday we'll have a telescope powerful enough to see that far. Dr. Lane, that's the highest priority secret message we've ever had at the Pentagon, and we've had some. How does it feel to be the head of a project as immense as this one? Truthfully, it's a little terrifying. Ah, but you mustn’t print that, Steve. Well, I should think it would be terrifying. I know enough about rocket propulsion to believe there's an outside chance you'll make it there. But, aren't you worried about getting back? I used to climb the Swiss Alps.. Our greatest ambition then was to climb the highest possible peak! We worried later about getting back. Can I print that, Doctor? If you wish. Well, Steve... This is a plum assignment for you... Making a trip of this sort, merely to report what you see. Yep, I'm the only one going who isn't a scientist. And you deserve it. You made a wonderful reputation as a war correspondent. You've been reading the jacket cover of my last book. Dr. Lane... I once heard of a man who climbed a higher mountain than anyone else alive. But, he was never able to get down again! And what's left of him is still up there. The point is, Steve, he made it. Where're you going? Preflight interviews, with everybody making the trip! I think I've gotten as much from Dr. Lane as he's gonna give. Oh, I'll give you the scientific reason why I want to go. I'm the non-scientist, remember, Doctor? No, I want to write about the... personal human reasons why a man would risk death to go out into space. You've given me yours. I gather you don't think they're too good. I'm on my way to see Jim Barker! Maybe your chief engineer has a different reason for wanting to go. Oh, I'm sure he must have. Steve, I'm a little puzzled. You're gonna write this all up, but how you gonna file a story on Mars to be printed back here? Well, General, I'm afraid I can't give you the answer to that one, yet. But, don't forget, while in route, we're gonna dropped these self-propelled space cylinders, aimed at Earth. They should land here. We'll be waiting for them. See you tomorrow at the take-off. So long... And so, the exact time and place of the take-off will remain a closely guarded secret. As to the immediate reaction to the sensational announcement... Congress is demanding to know why knowledge of so stupendous an undertaking has been kept so long from the public! Several senators have even questioned the advisability of the very project itself! The feeling expressed by many of them, whether we should stay where we are? Government officials were quick to label these remarks as isolationist! Well, here we go again. Well, let's get on with the interview. You know if we make it... both the isolationist, and the interventionist, will take the bows. Wait a minute, you said, "If we make it." Tell me, Jim, what do you really think our chances are of getting there? Well, everything we know about astronomy, propulsion... and rocket navigation, tells us that we will. Yeah, but there's a lot we don't know. There's a whole universe out there, Steve. The totally unknown. Beyond anyone's comprehension. We try to figure it out when we're kids, but... - we never can. - Yeah. Yeah, let me see if I can't frame my lead article featuring you! You see, I want to accent the human terms, about Jim Barker, chief engineer! Whose genius was largely responsible for the construction of the rocket. The man with a dream, who couldn't live or think or breath anything else. Who worked and planned for years to make this expedition possible. The man with a skylight in his Baltimore apartment... So he could sleep under the stars. You make it sound poetic. Oh, how are you, Carol? Oh, Carol, I'd like you to meet Steve Abbott. He's the newspaperman who's going on the trip with us. - Ah, Steve, this is Carol Stafford. - How do you do? Well, um, what are you doing here, Carol? We had a date tonight, Jim He held me up. Oh, yes, I can see you're all dressed to out. - A drink? - No! I understand you wanted to interview me, Mr. Abbott. Well, you couldn't have picked a better time. I'm just in the mood to tell the story of my life. Her brother was a physicist, who taught her a lot. She's a smart girl. I certainly am. She learned spaceship engineering in only 3 years. Spending each day right at the elbow of Mr. Jim Barker. Mr. Abbott, do you think 3 years is too long to spend at somebody’s elbows? Steve, call me Steve. I wasn't gonna let her take a trip like this, but... She learned so much, she became indispensable, I couldn't replace her. So, you see, Mr. Abbott, what you're looking at is an indispensable scientific unit. First assistant to the pilot of a rocketship. Well, there you have the whole story. I sure have. - Prof. William Jackson is here, sir. - Tell him to come in. Professor... Be right with you. I have only 5 minutes, they're waiting to take me to the television broadcast. I thought I was handling public relations? Look here, I don't even know you, I take the time and trouble to come to your hotel... Because I haven't been able to catch up with you. It was agreed that none of were to appear on radio or TV. Because once we start giving out interviews at random, and for commercial gain... The world has a right to my opinions and observations. That's why I was invited on this trip, to make observations, gather geological, chemical, astronomical data. Look, Prof. Jackson... You're a famous man, one of the outstanding scholars of our time. That's why you're coming with us, but they'll be no speeches on TV! Hello? Get me Dr. Lane at the Radcliff. I'm considered a scholar, but unfortunately that hasn't made me rich. On the contrary, it's left me quite poor. I'm leaving behind an ailing wife. A daughter whose husband was killed in the war, two young grandchildren. Look, just a minute, Doctor. I was to be given 3,000 dollars for my appearance on television. I wanted to leave it with them. Oh, sorry, Doctor. Yes, I wanted to talk to you, but it isn't important. It can wait. Yeah, I'll see you later. If you do a good job on TV, it'll save me the trouble of writing. So go ahead. Thank you! See you tonight, when the police escort picks us up. [A long series of good-byes.] Come on, we'll watch the take-off from the control tower. - Well, I guess that about does it. - Good luck, sir. - Thank you. Only 5 of us. - It seems lonely already. - Yeah. It's a matter of how much weight we can carry. I would liked to have asked a dozen more people. Hey, what happens when the rocket finally levels off? Do we walk on the walls? No... our gyro mechanism keeps this cabin vertical at all times. When we're in horizontal flight, that hatch there will lead to the tail sections. Better go there, lie down, and strap yourself in. Alright Carol, turn on the oxygen pressure, for take off. Oxygen OK. Control tower? Barker calling. Hello, Jim. This is Ed in the control tower. - Check my radio? - Give me a reading? Able George Baker ready, over. Check! Able George Baker ready. It's OK. Thanks, Ed. We're ready for take-off. Ground, please. Already for take-off. And Jim... good luck, fella. Thanks, Ed. I'll be seeing you. I hope. - Are you ready, Dr. Lane? - All ready. 10 second to take-off... Contact. We're ready, General. That you, Steve? You've been out in space 2 days now, got anything to report? Sure have, big news... Carol Stafford floated up to the top of the rocket... She kept bumping her head until we got the magnetic field stabilizer to equalize the gravitational pull. And how do like those for big words? Here's Jim Barker. Who'll give you the official rundown. Everything is going according to schedule. At the present rate, we should be out of the orbit of the Moon in 10 or 12 hours. After that, it should be clear sailing. Anything else? Over. Jim, the Press Association here wants to know whether we'll get some pictures to go with Steve Abbott's stories? We'll launch our first space cylinder in 24 hours. They'll be photographs and observations in that. If we lose radio contact, Steve can send all his stuff in the cylinder. Anything else? Over. -That's all for now, Jim. Over. - OK. Rocketship M-A-R-S signing off for now. So long. I'm glad we don't have to send all the technical meter readings. It was a good idea you had, Doctor, of having them transmitted automatically by radio. I think it'd be a good idea if you got a little rest, Jim. - You've been there ever since take-off. - Well, I kind of hate to leave. Don't be heroic, Jim, two days without a break is too long. Dr. Lane and I will take over. Well, keep your eye on the gravitational indicator, if there's any variation, call me. Go on, Jim. Remember, I helped to design that indicator. I guess I must be tired. I'll see you later. Mother Earth looks mighty good from here. Close enough to the Man in the Moon to talk to him. If you do talk to him, be careful what you say. The Moon could be a deadly menace to us! I had a shift in direction, 12 degrees. The gravitational pull of the Moon? We'll have to use power to pull out. Everybody take your stations! Where's Jackson? - Professor Jackson? - Coming. Alright Carol, the pressure. Pressure OK. Are we ready? - All ready. - Here we go! Well, that did it. Alright Carol, cut the pressure! All you have to do is ask! Well, at least we won't land on the Moon. Well, it's finally happened. We've lost contact with the rocketship. You'd better phone the general. No family, Professor? I've two grandchildren. They're beautiful. I've often wish I'd married, and had a family. Astronomy and engineering have taken up almost all of my life. My life's been sheltered, but full. Things I've learned I've passed on to others. You talk as if you were already dead. Do you really believe we're going to come back? Sure I do. Personally, I feel this rocket is my coffin. Who would have expected that attitude from you? As long as we remain alive, I'll contribute all that I know, to the success of the expedition. In the meantime, Professor, you're contributing an awful lot of gloom. He's contributed more than any of us! A real wife, a home, 2 lovely grandchildren, I'd trade 10 trips to Mars for that! Then you shouldn't have come along, Carol. Jim Barker... engineering genius. - Jim? - Skip it! It's just that being confined like this has gotten on my nerves. - Mine too. - You listening, Carol? - To what? - I think that you are a prize package. - Is this for Jim's benefit? - And very feminine. - He like's you. I sure do, Mr. Engineer. And I don't have to look in a test tube to find out. - Let's cut out this bickering. - I am not bickering. Nice try, but it didn't get over. Thanks anyway. Ah, the Earth seems so big when you're on it. From out here, so small and nothing. It's like closing your eyes in the dark, and suddenly there you are, alone with your soul. - You're homesick, Steve. - No, Professor, I haven't got a home. Sometimes I wonder who I am. Who any of us are. There was once a theory advanced that the universe is a living giant being. And that we, as human beings, made in its image are miniature universes in ourselves containing millions of corpuscles. The components of each corpuscle imagine themselves to be in a complete world of their own. Though they are aware of the universe of other worlds around them. - Oh, that's fantastic! - Is it? I wonder. We understand so very little really. If space is limitless, and endless, then don't you see, the opposite must be true too. Smallness never ends either. But continues being tinier and tinier. Just as the enormity of the universe become more and more enormous. Doctor, you're giving me the creeps. What happens to us when we die? Our universe dies. Just as the universe in which we ourselves live may some day be no more. But, there are endless universes beyond our own. I know the theory, but it makes this trip seem small, and futile. If we're simply going from one corpuscle, in some giant being, to another, what will we find? Crossing over may provide some of the answers to things man has wanted to know since the beginning of time. If so, we'll be swallowed in space, and forgotten. Holy mackerel, what's this? Come here, quick! - What is it? - I don't know... It looks as though the Earth's being bombarded. It isn't though. It's a storm of meteors. They're traveling at tremendous speed. When they reach the atmosphere around the Earth, friction makes them explode and disintegrate. We've all seen such fragments on summer nights. Most people call them shooting stars. Tell me, Doctor, are we apt to run into such a storm out here? It's possible. No contact, sir. Not for 48 hours now. From this point on, I'm afraid they'll have to depend on their space cylinders. Mars! Flight to Mars The 7th Day Still no radio contact with Earth. Otherwise everything Calm. General health and spirits good. All equipment continues to function satisfactorily. If all goes well, expect to be within orbit of Mars in next two Days. Launching space cylinder today at... Jim, what's the time and position? Have you finished with those computations for jettisoning the space cylinder? Almost, just a second. We are now at approximately... two degrees, S400x, 102, solar time. Well, that's about all there is to go. I hope the homing device works. I'd hate to have this land in the middle of the Sahara desert. - Didn't Steve have something to go? - Oh, yes! Would you mind seeing if Steve's material is ready yet? Of course, Professor. Everything's in the space cylinder but your notes. I wouldn't want to hold up a the space cylinder, but if the last paragraph isn't up to my usual high standard It'll be your fault for rushing me. How do you find so much to write about? Isn't easy. This trip's getting a little monotonous. Too monotonous? Do you feel that bitter about him? I don't know what you mean? A little revenge, huh? That ought to make him good and mad. I don't intend to tell him. How can you make a guy jealous if he doesn't know about it? - It's possible. - Oh. Glad to have been of service. What's the matter with you?! For a lady scientist, you aren't very objective? No... I guess I haven't been. Next time you get sore at him, call on me. Anytime. You shouldn't wait to the last minute before getting your notes to me. What's the big hurry? We have plenty of time, and space. I hope the homing apparatus on this cylinder functions properly. What was that?! Did you have any trouble getting that space cylinder off? -Why no, of course not. Good heavens, we're heading right into them! This can destroy us! We have to get out of here! - It means we'll have to go off course. - We have no other choice. - Alright, everybody take your stations. - Strap yourselves in. I have to give her full speed! You ready, Dr. Lane? - Ready! - Here goes! - Carol, the emergency lights! - Right! - I think we're through it. - Is everybody alright? Yes, I'm [??] - I think we're all clear now. - But we're considerably off course. Jim, you better check the ship for damage, and Carol and I will plot the course. Steve, you & the professor check the tail for any possible damage, especially the wires & cables. I'll check forward and see what I can find there. Steve, come here. Have you found a break? Yes, and something worse, take a look. Our landing gear... Got our radio batteries too. That's what cut the cable, probably shorted. Can it be fixed? I think Jim can fix the cable alright, but not the batteries and that shaft. Not a chance in the world. How'll we land? Maybe we won't. Well, folks, we have a real problem! The landing gear we depended on is now useless. We're going to have to crash land. Can't we use the jets to ease us down? We may have to, but it'll eat into our fuel supply. Better to use some of that to find a favorable landing spot. We have to make a choice. We can make it back to Earth, and attempt a landing there, or we can try landing on Mars. The choice is up to you. Well, I'm pretty fond of the world myself, even if it's only a little corpuscle. If we get back, maybe we can make another trip. Not much chance of that, if anything, it would discourage future flights. Assuming anyone does survive on Mars, what will he be able to do? Will he be able to report back what he finds? There's a remote possibility, the atomic power head might not have been damaged too much to get off a space cylinder. Doesn't look very promising either way. But if there's any chance of sending back and data, information about Mars... I'm in favor of going on. After all, that was the object of our flight. Our survival is of secondary importance. We can be on Mars within 24 hours. At least that's the shorter trip. If that's an advantage under the circumstances. We're almost to the top of that mountain you wanted to climb. What do you think, Carol? Well, doesn't look like we're going to come out alive either way. But, after all, we did set out to do something. That says it for me. I knew that already. OK, I'll make it unanimous. Good! I'm glad we're all together in spirit too. Jim, what's your plan? Well, I can't tell you, not 'til I see the terrain. We'll have to use our jets to look around, but it'll be rough at best. Well, it's in your hands. Alright, strap yourselves in! - What about you, Jim? - Forget about me! I see a place to land. If we make it, we may be able to take off again. Alright, hang on! He's coming around now. It's nothing serious. Don't tell me we made it. The concussion of our crash must have caused the avalanche. The snow's covered us completely. Oh, no it hasn't, look over here! - They look like chimney's. - They're regularly spaced. They may be [indistinct]. Come on, let's go out and have a look at them! - Are you...? - I just feel a little short of breath. We'd better put on oxygen masks. It's made of stone or brick. Very well made too. Obviously by civilized creatures of some sort. But it's very old, very! Maybe the race is extinct now. That's being a little pessimistic, Professor. No, no, professor Jackson may be right! We know, that ages ago, Mars was a much warmer planet. In cooling off, it lost much of its atmosphere. If people did live here, it may well be that the change killed them off. They don't seem to serve any purpose, do they? They may have been erected as some sort of religious symbols. Like the great stones the druids erected at Stonehenge or the pyramids in Egypt. Let's follow them along and see if there's any changes. We have been expecting you. Expecting us? You... you speak English? For many years we have picked up your radio broadcasts and deciphered them. Many of us have even learned to speak some of your languages. I am Ikron, president of our council, which rules this planet. We are... happy to meet you. And honored by the presence of your eminence. You say you picked up our broadcasts. Yes, your first 2 cylinders arrived back on Earth safely. Since then they have lost contact with you, and there is a worldwide vigil awaiting news of your party. Can we get through to them? No... Although, for years we have been able to receive broadcasts We are still unable to send them. Our best efforts have been reported by Earthmen only as: "Faint signals coming from Mars." You will come with us now. You may do the same, you won't need them anymore. Hey, this things moving. Yes, our cities are underground. This is magnificent. - Where do you get your air and light? - We make them. There is a mineral called corium, from which we extract hydrogen and oxygen. You'll find that we live rather well. That's a masterpiece of understatement. I think the council's waiting for you. You will find we have much in common. As you have no doubt already observed, we owe our continued existence here to science. All of our facilities will be placed at your disposal. Thank you... you've made us feel very welcome. And I don't think that scientist have ever had a richer field to explore. As you know, we have tried interplanetary flights. Though, for all our science, we have had no success such as, this. I am very much interested in what you have done. Tell me, this atomic power, which I have heard so much about, in broadcasts from you world. Just a moment, Ikron. We can exchange questions and answers endlessly, there'll be time for that. Now I suggest that our visitors be permitted to rest and refresh themselves. This is Tillamar, our senior adviser, and former chief of our council. Terris will show you to your dwelling, and after you have had time to adjust yourselves, we will talk further. Thank you. This is where you will live. Your sleeping rooms and other quarters are on either side. Thank you. - What I want to see is the kitchen. - The kitchen? - Yes, where food is prepared. - Oh, we don't have kitchens. We call it the food laboratory, and we have a large one for each district. You order your food and it is delivered ready to be served. This is a woman's paradise. As a matter of fact, I assumed you might be hungry, and ordered some things for you. They should be here by now. Everything is here, ready to eat. When you've finished, you just put everything back, close it up, and press this button. - That's all there is to it. - No dish washing? Well, that's taken care of mechanically. Mars, I love you. A tailor will be here to measure you for your wardrobe. - You'll be needing clothes, of course. - You mean, um... You can have more like those if you wish. No, no, we wouldn't think of it. When on Mars, do as the Martians do. We find these very comfortable, Well, I'll leave you now, I know you're tired and hungry. If you want me, you can reach me over the speaker. Well, if no one objects, I think I'll start setting out the food. -Yeah, I'll help you. I can hardly wait to see their chemical laboratories. What a remarkable place. The scientific skills and techniques of these people are truly incredible. A man could spend years doing research here. And you were all set to die! You were talking about Mars being the top of some big mountain we just climbed. Well, how do you propose we get back down? And you're talking about doing years of research. What good will it do if we can't get the information back to Earth? Or are we planning to spend the rest of our lives here? I can think of worst places to spend the rest of our lives. No, no, Jim is right! Our whole project is a failure unless we can get our findings back to Earth. But how, our rocket is wreaked? - Can we build another? - I don't know that yet. We might be able to salvage some of the essential parts, and maybe build others. But, it's a big job, and we'll need the help of the government here. Without it, we don't stand a chance. Even with it, it's's no sure thing. I don't know why they wouldn't hep us. Ikron said they were interested in interplanetary flight. Well, there's only one way to find out. As soon as we get settled, Jim and I will go before the council, and ask for their assistance. If our rocketship is to be reconstructed, we'll need all the help you can give us. That's why we are here, to ask for your approval, and assistance. Do you really think the rocket can be repaired? That depends on how much of it can be salvaged. It shouldn't be too much trouble to construct a new shell. The big problem will be if the atomic power head's been destroyed. In that case, you could not undertake such a flight. Well, we'd have to work on some, substitute. Possibly from your corium. We will send a party to salvage your ship, whenever you are ready. We want to help. However, this is a matter that must be discussed by our council. We will let you know our decision shortly. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. I was anxious that was not made to sound too easy. However, the approval will be granted. Do you still object to my plan? To destroy these people, and all the people on the world as well? Yes I do. We will build others from the same design. A fleet of them, a hundred fleets. And when we finish with the ruins of their world, what then? A plan to conquer the universe, more rocketships? Where is the end of it?! I seek only the sanctuary of a place to live for our people, our planet is dying! The corium will be gone! What plan do you suggest to save ourselves? That we make a pact with them, for certain areas of the Earth. The people who have come here have no power or authority to make pacts. Once we let them escape. Once their ship is gone. It may well be our last chance for survival. Surely they'll make other trips. What if they return in power and force, and conquer us? They will kill us! I ask for a vote of the council. My plan or Tillamar's? - Ikon. - Tillamar's! Iron's plan is carried by a vote of 4 to 3. I need hardly caution you, Senior Counselor, of the secrecy of this decision. The space travelers will not be warned. We will let them proceed with the rebuilding of their ship in the naive belief that we will let them return to Earth. Once the rocket is ready, they will become our prisoners. Fellow counselors, soon now... Soon... The evacuation from a dead planet will begin. First the armies. Then the civilians. This factory you've given us to work in is certainly ideal for our purpose. Some of those amazing new light metals you've shown me should be able to take the pressure perfectly. I have developed several that I think will be suitable. And this assistant that I'm sending to you, will see that you have the very best workmen available. You've undertaken quite a job, my friend. Well, most of the instruments are still intact. Oh, I don't think it should be too difficult for Jim, Justin. Not with your knowledge and advice available to him. You're right, Dr. Lane, Justin is our most eminent physicist and engineer. You couldn't be in better hands. I've already learned that. And I have arranged for our... astronomers to put aside their present projects to help you make any observations necessary to plot your return trip. How long do you think its going to take? Well, the sooner, the better. As you know, when we took off, the Earth and Mars were at their closest. The distance between them grows greater every day, As does the amount of fuel we'll need. That, Doctor, is our big problem. As you know, the atomic power heads were destroyed in the crash. From what Justin tells me, I think we should be able to substitute corium. I hope so! Interplanetary flight has always been very a great interest of mine. Feel free to call on us if you need any help. That, from Ikron, is a very generous offer. Corium is our most precious substance. Are you Jim? Um hum, that's right. Your new assistant has arrived. Oh, thanks, show him in. There's no one to show in, I'm your new assistant. My name's Alita. What's the matter, is something wrong? Well, no! It's just that I, ah... I... oh, sit down. And ah... I'm sort of puzzled on these... Ah, these new metals Well, this is the one you want, both can take the pressure, but this has a better coefficient of expansion for temperature variations. You'll do. I should have know Justin knew what he was doing. Do you like him? I think he's a wonderful man. Then I think you'll do too. - He's my father. - Oh, he's your... Oh, well, then, let's get to work, um... Say, this food is really great. There's a reason. In those hydroponic chemicals they used, they put every vitamin we know of plus several other tissue building elements. No wonder there're so few sick people here. These are really delicious! An amazing people. A great demonstration of what science can do. Who would think, forced to live underground they've mastered the highly complex problem of raising food to survive on. In a way, they're better off. Instead of fields in the open, subject to the uncertainty of weather they have great tanks, miles of them. We their controlled temperatures, they raise practically everything they wish. They've made this into a kind of Garden of Eden. You'll excuse me! You're not going back to the lab again? I have to... I've a few problems I have to solve. Well, can I help you, can I come with you? Thank, Carol, but no. I'll be alright. If you want some more revenge, just whistle. Poor Steve. So busy carrying a typewriter around the world with him that he never had time to fall in love. Then he met a lady scientist. - You're not in love with me. - No? Na, just making it up. Don't ever believe anything a writer says, especially a newspaper writer. Besides, we've nothing in common. I'll bet you've never been to a football game. Or seen the Dodgers in action at Ebbets Field. Well, makes sense, female scientist goes for male scientist, two of a kind. Me? I'm just a guy. You know, I think we both need a couple drinks. I've just made a big play for you. I know. No soap, huh? No soap, Steve. But you're wrong, I have been to lots of football games. I'm really not such a test tube specimen as you seem to think. And if I'm an idiot about Jim, it's... something I can't help. Maybe you should try harder. Oh, good evening. You won't need it until tomorrow. If I find it, I'll have it put aside for you. Thank you, good night. Good night. I have to know when they're going to be able to fly back to Earth. - It's too early to tell yet. I would have learned more if the girl hadn't interrupted me. - Well, she doesn't suspect you? - Oh, no, I'm sure of that. Good. I must be sure that they're concealing nothing from me. Yes, sir. Well, I didn't expect to find you working tonight. I was talking to Father about this at dinner, he gave me an idea, - I couldn't wait to try it out. - Yes. Well, he thinks if we increase the temperature more rapidly, the molecules will release more energy. It's what you call a higher sparking power for the trigger mechanism. I hope he's right. If he is, it will save us a lot of time. - Is it ready? - Almost! You can connect those cables now. I know it'll work this time. That's fine. Well, this will tell the story. Now, its got to spark to at least 200, or we'll never get off the ground. Alright, switch on. - Look at that! - I knew it would work. - I've got to tell Dr. Lane right away. - You go ahead, I'll close up here. This is a very good one. That's the Earth, but it's partially obscured by mists. Yes, and it's getting further away every day. We tested the new firing mechanism, and it works. - Did it register 200? - It went to almost 300! You mean we'll actually be able to get back? Easily! But it'll take about a week or so to get it built to scale, and get it installed. But, you and Carol can start figuring out the fuel load now, As of what date? You know the distance is widening. - Figure it a month from now. - Fine! That'll give everyone time to gather up whatever we want to take back. Come, Carol. Yes, there's no question about it. They will be able to take off for their own planet. Let them think so. Do you know how long before they'll be ready? No, but I'll find out in time. Good. I want them to complete their work. Then we'll step in. But, there can be no doubt about it, I heard it myself! Why does he act this way? I took it for granted that we'd show him everything we know. From what our Alita reports, he plans to let you complete your work and then at the last minute, take it away from you! My advice to you is to leave before he realizes that you're ready to take off. We can't, we let it be known only this morning, that we plan to take off in a month. But you could be ready in 2 weeks, couldn't you? No, it's useless, he has spies everywhere, that know every step of our progress. Jim, I think I know something we can do. Try to get that ?? finished as soon as you can. It's almost ready. Don't go in there, it might explode. What is it? What happened? I don't know, I was working, and suddenly there was a great flash and explosion behind me. Alzar, come here, I need help! - I'm alright now. - Is there much damage? Just the trigger mechanism. But it'll take at least another month to replace it. That long? - Maybe longer. - Oh, no. Everybody can go home now, there's nothing more you can do today. Beautiful performance. Dr. Lane! - Dr. Lane! - Yes. - Oh, what's the matter? - We're in trouble, it's serious. - Jim, are you hurt? - No, no. Well, is the rocket damaged? No, but I want everyone to think it is. I faked an explosion. I've learned there's a plot to keep us from leaving. Ikron's government plans to take the rocket away from us as soon as it's finished. - Are you sure of this? - Positive! - What can we do? - We can leave in 2 weeks. They think it's going to take at least another month for us to repair the damage Can we get away without their knowing it? It's our only chance, we've got to try. - Better tell the others right away! - No, no, not yet. It's too dangerous a secret. Just get them to speed up their work. Jim, you're tired, you... you ought to try and get a little rest, and relax. Yes, I intend to, tonight. I think maybe we'll play a little bridge. Bridge! If you introduce that game on this planet, the people will never forgive you. Four hearts. Pass. One. Five. Well, I've got good help for you. That's wonderful support, I'll make it, easily. Where did you ever learn to play bridge? Jim taught me. I'm surprised at you, Carol. Haven't you noticed that Jim and Alita are 'that way'? You're supposed to say it isn't true. Of course it isn't true. Sit down, Jim, I'll go after her. Why did you say a thing like that? Wake up, genius. I was once a lonely hearts editor. Sorry that happened. I understand. No, I don't think you do. Oh, yes I do. You even taught me that. Then I must be crazy. How many years you been in love with him? Three. How many tears do you think it'll take to wash out 3 years? Go away, Steve. I can't. I'm about to win a game from myself. Ever play solitaire? I've been playing for a long time. Please go! But it gets tiresome. Just like some girls I know. What do you mean? You cried for exactly 1 hour and 17 minutes. Well, nobody asked you to sit in on it. No, it's the idiot in me. Steve! That gets tiresome too. Alright, that'll be all for today fellas. Alright. I'd like to make that installation myself. Oh, by the way... You can have tomorrow off, there won't be anything for you to do until the day after. Well, thanks! They don't know it, but they've done their last work on this baby. What about that? The emergency lights? Two minutes work. I can do that after take-off. You know, I can't believe it. It's finished, ready to go. It's great, isn't it? Yes, yes it is. What's the matter, Alita? You'll be going! Of course, I'm happy for your sake. You'll be able to get back now. That's right, I'll be leaving, won't I? Well, it isn't as if you're going so far. After all, the Earth is only 35 or 40 million miles from here. You know, the way we've constructed this thing... there's a good chance we might be able to bring back a couple of extra people. I didn't want to tell you until I was sure of it. But you're going back with me, you and your father. No. Why? There's a reason why our government wants the rocketship. Ten years from now, they'll be no more corium! After that, all life here will be extinct. Unless something is done. You mean, what Ikron wants to do? No, there are other solutions. Yes, but unfortunately, he's in power. There's Tillamar, he's a great leader. It would be better for the future of our planet if he and my father went. Yes, but can we trust Tillamar? Can we tell anyone we're ready for take-off? If I confide in Tillamar, I'm risking the fate of my whole crew. Five people? Yes, I see your point. Whatever we decide here, you have my promise that I will not reveal you plans. Will you yourself, Tillamar, come with us, as spokesman for your planet? As a statesman to plead your cause. And you can deliver whatever news there is from the world beyond. Perhaps to replace corium, Earth will want many thing we have here. Inventions far beyond anything Earthmen have yet achieved. - Interplanetary trade relations. - You'll go then, Tillamar? Yes, I will go, but once I'm gone Ikron will declare me a traitor. Oh, perhaps at first, but when you have talked to our people through Earth's broadcasts, of your plan, and that you're on a mission for them. There will be a new vote in the council, Ikron will be overthrown. Well, how can you be sure of that? Because I will stay here as your representative, and organize the active opposition. Don't worry, Alita. You're going, not I. But I'll see you again, I have confidence in Tillamar that I will. I've called you all together to tell you that thanks to Jim, repairs on the rocketship are now complete. We'll take off tomorrow! Well, how do you know it will function properly? You haven't been able to make any real tests. That's the chance we'll have to take. But I'm positive it will work. What's to keep them from stopping us? That's just it, they don't know that it's ready. And if we handle it right, and we're very careful, we'll be gone before they know it. We've worked out plans whereby each one of us will enter the ship tomorrow at different times, without arousing suspicion, and remain there until take-off. Everything must be done with extreme secrecy. Ikron apparently has spies everywhere. So let's get packing. Ah, just a moment, if you don't mind, ah... How it is that I've... asked Alita to come back with me and be my wife. - Certainly! - Great idea. [Broken audio follows] - Am I supposed to say something? - Some kind of witty remark. Tillamar will be with us also. [Broken audio] [Unintelligible] Oh, don't apologize, Jim. I think it's great that we're taking some live specimens back with us. Well, anybody seen that deck of cards? What do you want with a deck of cards? I feel a game of solitaire coming up. Come on. - Professor? - Yes? Here. - Everything all right? - Yes. This gets all the important stuff. The others will be aboard later in the day. - Yes, Terris? - I'm worried about the rocket, sir Something is going on, it looks very suspicious. Why do you think so? First of all, no workmen have been allowed inside the rocket in the last 24 hours. And secondly, the corium tanks, which were to hold fuel for their return, have been moved from the laboratory. You mean they may have been placed in the rocket? I don't know, even if they are on the ship, it may mean nothing. But I thought you ought to know, you might want to question one of them. Well, there is one we can question. The girl, Alita. - Good, I will bring her here. - No, no, no, not here! In the council room. - I will call a meeting at once. - Your excellency. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? - Girl scientist! - Oh, yes. Now I remember. You know, I've been thinking. If we make it back to Earth, I'd like to do a series of articles. Enchanting idea. - Very worthwhile. - But you see, I'm not an author. I'd need a ghost writer. - Do you suppose that you... - How long would it take? Oh, I don't know... Maybe the rest of our lives. If you're kidding, I'll break your neck. I'm not kidding, I think you'd make a wonderful collaborator. I'm not happy leaving you here. But think of the adventure before you. I'll miss you. But not for long my child. And I'm sure you're going to be very happy with him. I think so too. - Are you going aboard the rocket now? - Yes. Goodbye, Alita. What is this? - Terris? - You come with us. Yes, the tanks are on the rocketship, but I told you why. The new outlet valves have to be tested. Why are they new? The old ones didn't fit. They were damaged during the explosion. You say they can not possibly be ready, for another 2 weeks, for a take-off. I only know what Jim says, and I heard him say that just yesterday. - Everyone else on board? - Yes. - Well, I'll be off. - I'll follow you in 10 minutes. Weren't Alita and Tillamar supposed to meet you here? Yes, that was the plan, they should have been here by now. Jim, are you sure everything is alright? Yes, don't worry about it. It's a long trip, you better get started, Doctor. - Where's Alita, it's almost time to go? - That's what I came to tell you. You must leave immediately while you can. Alita's being held before the council for questioning. - Then she and Tillamar are both there. - Yes! - Tillamar has double crossed us. - There's no proof of that! - She may be in danger of her life! - Forget Alita. Leave in the rocket while you still can. No, we'll go to the council meeting. Tillamar may even have done something to the rocket! Will you tell us the truth, or go on lying? I suggest we hold her, and send our men to seize the rocket at once. - The council will vote on it. - Wait! If she's telling the truth, what will be gained by seizing the rocket? According to her, it isn't ready to go. And if we take over the rocket now, it may never be ready for flight. We need the Earthmen working on it. If she's lying, it'll depart, and we'll be left with nothing. Ikron, I have trust in the things of the universe! - And in the creator. - You are a naive fumbling old man! A vote. Ikron's plan or Tillamar's? It's time for action, not words. Those who favor Ikron. Wait! Why are you here? We should request his permission to have our men investigate the rocket. Why should it be investigated at all? What is all this? I have the promise of your help. We have good and just reason for believing you have betrayed us. If that is so, you will find our generosity is at an end! And the sort of hospitality we will show will have a different taste. - A vote, Ikron's plan or Tillamar's? - Ikron's!! Very well! The rocket is to be seized at once. These people are to be held. Alita! - Jim should have been here long ago. - I don't understand it. I do, there's trouble. Something must have gone wrong. I think I see Jim and Tillamar now. With Alita. Open the sky hanger! It isn't opening. It won't open! Turn on the oxygen! Can we get out? Take your stations! Strap yourselves in! - You ready? - All ready!
