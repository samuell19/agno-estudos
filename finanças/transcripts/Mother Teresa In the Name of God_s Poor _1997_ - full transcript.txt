(singing in foreign language) (choir singing) (speaking Latin) (choir continues) (speaking Latin) (speaking Latin) (choir continues) Partition. Now that the British are leaving India, the subcontinent will be divided into two countries-- India, where the Hindus are majority, and East and West Pakistan, where Muslims will be the rulers. Yes, Sunita? Is this something the British want, or do we Indians want it? Oh... Opinions are divided on all sides. Mahatma Gandhi is against partition, but many people who follow him are all for it. They believe that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together in free country. Alice? What do you think, Sister Teresa? There was a reason God asked me to join his church. He knows I have no head for politics. (laughter, bell rings) Oh, 4:00, girls. That's all for today. We'll be late for Vespers. What do you mean there is no food? Headmistress, we haven't had any deliveries for two weeks. Hadi, there is nothing to cook, at all? No. But we have 200 girls to feed. There are riots in the street, ma'am. No one can go out. This is not a safe area for us to live in. It's right in between the Hindus and the Muslims. Sister Gabriella... if the mountain don't come to Mohammed... Mr. Pradesh's warehouse should be down here. This is it. Hello? Hello? Mr. Pradesh! Hello? (crowd shouting) Oh! (gasps) (child cries) What brings two nuns out of cloisters at a time like this? An emergency. We are from Loreto Convent, with 200 hungry girls to feed and no food. Well, there's only meat for vultures out here. No, I can't let those girls go hungry. Oh, come on, then. Douglas! I'm sure they won't miss a bag or two. (crowd continues shouting) On board, ladies, on board. Ah! This should keep your little lot fed till this mess is over. Are we stealing this? Requisition is the word. I'm sure your credit's good, Sister. Come on, lad. Come on! When you see what we had these last few days, you'll say to yourself, "We've given them everything we can, so let 'em have their blasted independence." (car horn honking) Get off! Back off, make way! (crowd continues shouting) Get back! Get off! Get out of the way! Please, Sahib, help us! Please help, Sahib! Rice for me and for my child! Pay no attention, Sister. The war has caused these people to be put through the worst famine in Indian history. They've been starving ever since. Get off! Ride, man, ride! (crowd continues shouting) Go, go, go! You're gonna get yourselves killed! Come on, Douglas, open the gate. Now, move it! Go! What's going on? Mother, we have food. We have food! Oh, glory be to God! Cook! Food! (crowd shouting) (girls screaming) (gasps) Ashad! To infirmary. Yes, yes, Sister. He's bleeding-- I don't know how to help. Oh, Lord. Right. Put pressure on his wounds. He's lost a lot of blood. No, no. You must keep up the pressure. We've got to stop the bleeding. Can you do it? Sister, I am geography teacher. (sighs) Sister Teresa, I thought I'd find you here. May I speak with you? Sister Gabriella told me how distressing it was to go outside. I'm so ashamed. Ashamed? But you went out for a good reason. I saw the starving children of God out there, Father. I did nothing to help. You were bringing food for our girls. There were girls out there too, Father. Hungrier than ours. But our first duty is to our school and our convent, Sister, surely. How can that be? How can God wish me to be concerned only about the girls in here? Surely, he cares as much about the people living outside these walls? We're all under strain right now, Sister. I spoke with Mother Superior. We both feel you should go on retreat sooner than planned. You need time to think things through-- to rediscover the joy in your work. Father Verru was right. But I could not forget what I had seen outside. And I knew I had to do something to make life better for the poor. Mary can't sleep, Sister. She says she's having nightmares. Mary, Mary. Hey. When I was nine years old, my father died. In my own country, Albania, where I was born, there was a lot of political strife. For many years, I couldn't understand what happened, why my father didn't come home. And I used to recite a poem to myself over and over. "His red heart beat with love for child, wife, and country, and then burst into bloom, like crimson rose dropped on crumpled shirt." This poem is about believing in love, Mary, even when everything you see around you is hatred and destruction. To bed. Mary? Tomorrow, I think you have a poem to write, just like I did when I was nine years old and when my father died. Goodnight, girls, God bless you. (girls) Goodnight, Sister. Sister? I-- some of the older girls, they say we shouldn't take care of the injured Muslims. They say they are to blame for the violence. We take in whoever needs our help, Maria. Hindus, Muslims-- makes no difference to God. (train whistle blowing) Darjeeling! Darjeeling train, all aboard! All aboard, Darjeeling train! All aboard! I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, ma'am. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, ma'am. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty-- Sister Teresa, come on, we're leaving. Thirsty, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. (groans) I'm thirsty, ma'am, I'm thirsty. Please, Sister. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. (train whistle blowing) So, what can I bring you today, sir? (sighs) Look at it. Breathtaking, isn't it? I so look forward to these retreats. I can almost taste the mountain spring water right now. It's so fresh-- and the fruit! It always tastes much better up there. (flute playing) (train whistle blowing) (overlapping chatter) The more time I spent outside, the more I became aware of the privileges that were being granted to me but denied to others. Why? Why should I be treated any differently? We are all children of God. Sister? Come-- your friend, come. What-- what is it? She's gone into third class. (gasps) Sister Teresa! What on Earth are you doing? It's another world, isn't it? It's completely unacceptable behavior. I mean, what will people think? I wish I had time to find out. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, thirsty, I'm thirsty... Welcome back. I understand you were very quiet on retreat, very withdrawn. I'm sorry, Father. Oh, it's not to apologize for. I understand you were deep in your thoughts. And you do seem more rested. Yes, Father. I am resolved. In fact, God himself told me what I must do. God lets us know him by our own feelings. He spoke to me. He spoke to me through the voice of a sick beggar. Sister-- I heard him clearly. Sister, you realize what you're-- He said, "I am thirsty," Father. You think you heard the voice of God? Same way I heard him when he called me to his church, even though I was too young, only 13. Now, he has called me again. He wants me to follow him into the slums, to help the poorest of the poor. But you're a cloistered nun, you can't go outside. Father, it is a call. It's a call within the call. Do you remember what Mahatma Gandhi told the Christians in India? He said, "If you want to help, go to the people as one of them. Work among them." How can we do that from behind these gated walls? You no longer want to be a nun? Heaven forbid, Father, the church is my life. No, I only want permission to work outside. I've heard of nuns suffering delusions as a result of heat stroke, but this takes the cake. We've all been affected by the troubles. And it could be that Sister Teresa is struggling to reaffirm her faith. But she believes God has called her to follow him into the slum. Well? I believe that Sister Teresa is sincere. She just hasn't considered the implications. Which are? It'll upset the entire convent if a nun of Sister Teresa's experience gives up everything and leaves. She wants to apply for exclaustration, Mother Superior. This would allow her to remain in the Loreto Order and live by her vows. All she's asking for is permission to work outside the walls. That's the other problem. The Loreto Order has always been cloistered. And now a nun comes along and says she heard the voice of God, in a tunnel! But she makes a compelling argument. She says that in the face of every suffering man, woman and child in India, we can find the face of Jesus Christ. She calls it God's distressing disguise. Heaven forbid one of the children hears that the headmistress is hearing voices and seeing visions. I think it's clear this matter should remain strictly confidential. Of course, but what are we to tell Sister Teresa? Tell her nothing. But Your Grace-- This isn't the first time a nun has asked for permission to leave the cloister. Last time, I advised the applicant to wait a year. 12 months later, she sat in that chair and thanked me for not taking her request seriously. Sister Teresa, Your Grace, she's never not serious. Tell her to write a letter to me in a year's time. Until then, this matter is closed. ♪♪ I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty... (choir singing) Commissioner? Harry Harper. We met the other night at the reception at Governor House. Ah, yes, yes. The American journalist hungry for a face-to-face with Mr. Gandhi. Yes, well, I'd like to report on India's transition to independence fairly. People need to hear about official ceremonies like this, but they also need to hear about Gandhi's presence in Calcutta to protest the violence. (people applauding) Do you really care about the Muslims and Hindus, Mr. Harper? Absolutely. (chuckles) (trumpet calling) (band playing) (applause) Now, the year is finished. The Archbishop has agreed to forward your letter to Rome, but only under one condition-- that you apply for a decree of secularization. But that means I would have to leave the order. It's the only way he will consider your request. If you leave, you leave as a laywoman, not as a nun. But... I've lived as a nun for 17 years, I can't live any other way. Then you must give up the idea. I can't leave Loreto. Hello, there, Sister. This is my family. It's too much of a risk. If your plan doesn't work out, you won't be able to come back here. It's God's plan, Father, not mine. I will rewrite the letter. A sad day, isn't it? No, not really. It was good while it lasted. So... you going back to England soon? No, not me, sir. I lost my wife and kids in the Blitz. Oh, well, I'm sorry. Well, I've got my pension. I might get around to opening up a little hotel, gentlemen's club, that sort of thing. Uh-huh. Your first time in India? No, I was, um, born here actually. My parents moved to the States and settled there when I was a kid. Oh, you work for the International Chronicle? Yep. And I have a feeling things aren't gonna stay quiet around here for very long. You let me know if anything interesting happens in Calcutta? Right you are, sir. (laughing) (overlapping chatter) Sister? Sister? You see that street? The families we visit during our Sodality outings live there. Would it be all right if we looked in on them? Oh, please? Then they can meet you. Well, if we all stick together, I suppose it'll be all right. You must not take more than half an hour. They will be worried at Loreto. All right, girls. Stick together. (overlapping chatter) (gasps) This woman must be taken to hospital. What's wrong with you? She's dying. She needs care. (flies buzzing) (speaking foreign language) It's all right. We will help you. Our hospitals are so crowded, we just don't have any space. It would be a waste to use valuable resources on a hopeless case. But she's a person. We can't do a thing for her. Like anyone else, she's one of God's children. I understand your feeling, Sister, but we just can't take her. What are we to do with her? Try another hospital, I don't know! I want my cart back. But they won't take her. That's not my problem! (thunder cracking) Sister, take the girls back to Loreto. But what will you do? I don't know. Come on, girls, single file. You come with me. I take care of you. Come on. (woman groaning) You have to leave. You're blocking the entryway. Don't worry now. All right, Ma? (rain falling) Sister, the doctors have agreed to take her in. Bless you. Ma... You are doing a beautiful thing for God. (thunder roaring) My mother always said if you do something good, do it without big fuss. Suddenly, I realized I was lost. Lost in the back streets of Calcutta. Give me money. Money, rupees for food. I don't have anything. No money. Why you in such a hurry? No. What are you hiding from us? No, no. Give me money. Money! Money! Can somebody help me? Please, can... (gasps) Hari! Are you all right, Sister? Oh, yes. I didn't realize the outside world could be so confusing. You are very lucky, Sister, in this neighborhood. No, Hari. They're just very poor. I must get used to that. (organ playing) I have the reply to your letter. (gasps) If you like, I'll tear it up unread. If they've granted your request, this may be your last mass as a nun. Let me pray first, Father. Whatever God has decided for me. Oh. Oh! It is manifestly God's will. You've been granted the decree of exclaustration for a trial period of one year. You can leave Loreto as a nun and remain in our order. How did this happen? I changed your request to secularization. It's as if... God knows what he wants. Yes! He knows. Yes! My friend Mr. Pillay has about the best saris. This is pure silk, worthy of a princess. The thread is real gold. Cotton, Hari. I asked for a cheap cotton sari. I told him, but he said it's not fit for a European. Ah, how 'bout this, Sister? The cloth flows like wine. And probably costs the same too. Ah... what about this one? That one? That one he gave me very reluctantly. It cost just a few rupees. This is the one. May the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost bless this habit and enable you to be faithful to your commitment for the rest of your life. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen. His Grace, the Archbishop, would like you to keep a record of your activities. With all you hope to do for the poor in Calcutta, you'll need help of all kinds. Are you planning to meet with the governor? Oh, no, I won't do that. Then where will you begin? All I know is I must leave Loreto. After that, God will direct me. (bells tolling) After dreaming of this day for two years, leaving Loreto Convent was the most difficult thing I had ever done-- much more difficult than leaving my family. It was only my firm belief in God's plan that gave me the courage to give up everything once again. He would not let me down. (overlapping chatter) (bell ringing) Mommy? You should go around the back. I will ask my cook to give you something to eat. I-- I'm looking for Mr. Goma. Father Verru wrote to him about me. I am Sister Teresa from Loreto Convent. (sighs) I'm so pleased! Forgive me, I was expecting a nun. Please come, Sister. My husband is waiting. Oh, thank you for your generosity. And the church wants you to work in a place like Moti Jihl? That's a huge risk, isn't it? Something I do willingly, Mr. Goma. Father thought, as a member of his parish, perhaps you could suggest a place for me to stay not too far from Moti Jihl. As you can see, my own home is a humble place, and I have a large family. I'll have to think if, uh-- Daddy, the two rooms upstairs are empty, and the attic. (clears throat) I suppose they are. But I doubt Sister will find them comfortable or-- The simplest of rooms would be perfect. I won't be in the way. I will be gone all day, only need a place to sleep at night. We have plenty of spare furniture. If you need anything, you can just ask, Sister. Thank you, you're very kind. ♪♪ Mr. Goma. Oh, we have more chairs and tables you can borrow, Sister. The fewer possessions I have, the better. Nothing should distract me... from my work for the poor. (overlapping chatter) Sister, Sister, money! Hello. Sister, money. Money! Money! Money! Sister! Sister, money! (kids continue begging) I have no money. No, I have-- I have no money! My lunch! (kids chattering) My name is Sister Teresa. I'm a daughter of the Christian Church. I have come to Moti Jihl to work with you. To try to improve your lives. But I need your help. I can't give you clothes, or food or money. I am as poor as you. But I can teach your children how to read. (woman screaming) (flies buzzing) (screaming continues) (gasps) What are you doing? Leave her alone! (baby crying) (man singing in distance) When I was a little girl in Skopia, Mother used to take me to visit the poor. She taught us that it is our responsibility to help the less fortunate. Sometimes we would come to the dinner table and find total strangers sitting down to share our meals. "Who are these people?" we would ask. She would say, "Distant kinsmen." But they were beggars and destitutes that my dear mama had brought in. But never did I see such poverty and suffering there as I see here. (overlapping chatter) Come! You want to eat my lunch again? Oh! Do you like to hear stories? I have a wonderful story I will tell you. Sit down. Once, a long time ago-- I'm going to tell a story. A long, long time ago, there lived a handsome prince called Rama, and his beautiful wife called Sita. They lived in a big, beautiful palace in a beautiful country, but that was ruled by a very nasty king... And the king was slain by the brave prince, who rescued his princess, and they lived happily ever after. Another one! Tell us another one! You like stories? Yes! You like stories? (children) Yes! You know, you can tell stories like that to each other. We don't know any. But you can read them. From books, you can read any story you want. We can't read. Ohh. Let me test you. Let's all together say the word "king." (children) King. Now, I show you how to write it. Kh-- everyone, "kh." (children repeat) Then, "ih." (children repeat) Then, "nnn." (children repeat) Then, "guh." (children repeat) And all together, that is... "Kh-ih-nnn-guh." (children) King! You see! You have just learned to read your first word! (gasps) Yay, we did it!

She is teaching them about the Christian God. She wants to convert them to her faith. No, she's teaching them to read. She's giving them a chance in life. She's a troublemaker. You are a troublemaker, Manik! (scoffs) Women. (children) "X," "Y," "Z." Very good! You all get a prize. (groans) You all get a prize. Soap! ♪♪ Over here. They arrived a week ago from the country. He came to get a job, but he got sick. Now, the whole family is sick. No one can help them, because they are afraid of getting the disease too. We'll take the worst case to hospital. (sighs) (flies buzzing) (people coughing) (gasping) Feeling better? What happened? You fainted. You haven't been eating enough. Your blood sugar was too low. Don't you know that, when you work in conditions like you're in every day, you're supposed to eat three meals and get plenty of rest. Oh. No. I'm Sister Stephanie. Father sent for me. Oh. The sick family... I have to help them. I have to go. You're not going anywhere. The people in the slums... I failed them, failed. You neglected your own care while worrying about others. That is no way to bring charity to the poor, Sister Teresa. That is the way to-- to rob yourself of your usefulness. I've been through this all myself. You have? In Patna. I run a hospital in one of the poorest areas for the Medical Mission Sisters. Believe me, to do this work, you have to have strict rules and rigorous discipline. Will you be in Calcutta for a while? Will you teach me? That's as clean as we can get it. Now, it's time to dress the wound. Now, remember, it's essential that you take an hour of rest every day, and one day off a week. To keep working in these conditions, balance is essential. (indistinct conversation) To guard against the spread of disease, all clothing must be washed every day.

Thank you, Sister. Thank you. (overlapping chatter) (bells tolling) Today I learned an important lesson. I was going and going, and my legs and my arms were so sore. And then the comfort of Loreto came to tempt me. I had not heard those bells for several months, and I could not resist a glimpse into my past. Had I made the right decision by leaving? It did not take God long to give me an answer. (man begging) Oh! (overlapping chatter) (baby crying) Oh, baby. Baby! Oh, dear, oh, baby. Come, baby, come, come.

No, nothing-- What are you trying to do to us? I was only trying to help. I know about you. You are trying to steal our children. Please, I don't want to cause any trouble. Then why are you here? You want to turn our children into Christians. No! You are stealing their souls! No, if I could just explain. We don't need your explanations. They're all lies anyway.

She can teach that layabout son of yours a thing or two! I don't need help from a white woman. How can I thank you? You saved my life. You've taken a huge debt from my shoulders, Sister. Good. (kids chattering) (birds cawing) This will be a beautiful place-- a place where people can die with dignity. But people here don't understand. Why would a European woman leave those beautiful, clean big buildings up there, where there's plenty of food, fresh air and safety, and come down here to live in the slum? I don't know how to explain it to you, Jyoti. But Sister, everyone around here would do anything to get out of Moto Jihl, including me. I choose this out of my own free will to do the work of God. (overlapping chatter) We should be removing the garbage from Moto Jihl, not adding to it. The people wouldn't like that. It's so unhealthy, look. (scoffs) If we all got together and cleared all this up, Moti Jihl would be a better place to live. Never! It's our livelihood. We survive by picking through the garbage of Calcutta. If this goes away... (overlapping chatter) I'll do it. You finish the beds. Your influence has even made a big impression on this pigsty. (chuckling) And I thought I was making a real sacrifice letting you use the place. You're a good and generous Christian, Mr. Goma. Your hospital pretends to know nothing about you. But my little Mabel refused to leave until they gave her some bandages. Thank you. Thank you. Every spot of life has infinite value. And every person counts no matter how sick, no matter how disfigured. Charu Ma. Have you seen Jyoti? He's out there, Sister. Jyoti, I need the water inside. I can't go in there, Sister. Why not? I'm Hindu, I can't be near death. It's impure. Only the harijan can deal with the dead. The untouchables. But he's not dead yet. We're trying to relieve his suffering. He has great suffering. The body's not important, the spirit is. If that man is suffering, it's his Karma, his destiny. You are interfering. I respect your beliefs, Jyoti. But I need you to respect mine. Shouldn't you say the last rites, Sister? Receiving the water from the River Ganges is the holiest of rites for Hindus. He's in the hands of God now. Give me courage now this very moment as you did when I was 18 and I had to leave behind mother and sister and brother, knowing I might never see them again. Nanalokay, sister Agay, brother Lassar. So many years have intervened. So many words. Today, what tortures of loneliness. From the Calcutta Corporation, they will give us land and build a small school house when we have 100 pupils. It won't be long now. Meanwhile, I think we should open a school for only Muslim girls. (truck horn honks) (shouting) Sounds like trouble, Sister. (horn honks) (crowd shouting) It's for your own good! Don't you understand?! The authorities don't want you to live in filth anymore! Is this your doing, Sister? No! Then you have to stop them. Will they listen to me? It might make things worse. Please. (shouting) Hey, you! You're obstructing municipal workers! Get down! Get down, or I'll arrest you! Who are you? Sister Teresa from the Loreto Order. I work here in Moti Jihl. In this slum? With these hooligans? These people are my sisters and my brothers. We share the slum with the rats. She's not one of us! Take her away with you! We don't want a white woman! Did you hear that? Get out of the way before you get hurt. Their only fault is that they're poor. Poverty is an accident, it tells you nothing about a person. I don't have the time to be preached. This man there, Manik Sulamin, the man you want to arrest. He has four sons and a wife. He keeps them alive by salvaging garbage from this dump. What will happen to his family if you arrest him? City officials have ordered this operation. It's my job to make-- Have the city officials asked these people what they want? No! No! If they're so eager to help, why don't they try and find a way to bring clean water to Moti Jihl? What about those toilets that are supposed to be cleaned once a week? The sanitation workers never come. No one can go near those places, they're smelling so badly. Some people use the gutters. It's not my responsibility. Then make it your responsibility. Please, Mr. Commissioner. I ask you on behalf of the people of Moti Jihl, go to your city authorities and ask them to cancel these orders. Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Yes! (crowd shouting) (camera shutter clicks) For the safety of the men, this operation is discontinued for now. Thank you, Commissioner. (cheering) You haven't heard the last of this. (cheering) Sister. I was wrong about you, Sister. No time for apologies. We have much work to do. (cheering) (scoffs) Well, I'll be. If it isn't that pushy little headmistress again. Now, she's working in the slums. Harry Harper, this may interest you. Now that you've finished school, will you go to Europe with your mother, Sunita? Perhaps. I first want to visit Sister Teresa. Ah, well, tell her we miss her. Good luck. God bless you. Thank you, Sister. Tell Sister Teresa that we want her to come back. Tell her that. They won't let her back. They say she's walking around Calcutta like a beggar woman. They say she's cracked. Oh, shut up. Is it true? That's not true. I want to see for myself. If I could, I'd run away and go and work with her. (laughing) You better finish school first, Maria. Just one year to go. Bye. Bye. Five more deaths, we are caring for 16 men, 13 women, and six children. More come every day. (knocking) Who is it? Sunita. Sunita! How did you find me? What are you doing here? Father gave me your address. I've come to work with you. Oh! (gasping) This is the first time in my life I've seen you at a loss for words. The Sister of Calcutta to help her poor. Ah, morning, Mr. Goma. Good morning, good morning. The Bengalis have a custom of setting aside a cup of rice for a beggar. Sister Teresa has inspired our congregation to practice it liberally. Maria, what are you doing here? I have come to help. But what about school? What will your parents say? They want me to get married. But I want to be a nun. Please, Sister Teresa. Let me stay with you. We can't, Sister. She hasn't completed high school yet. But I want to help the poor. Come to Moti Jihl. Come and see. Come and see if this the life you really want. (chanting) (coughing) (people groaning) Come. Let me show you what to do, come. There are four of them now. It's outrageous. Sit, both of you. Do you realize what it looks like? A group of young Indian girls from the best families running around Calcutta unsupervised. But they are hardly unsupervised. Sister Teresa is their headmistress. She knows how to handle-- I agree with the Archbishop. It's putting our whole order into a bad light. I'm putting a stop to this right now, Father. It's clear this experiment is grossly out of control. With all due respect, Your Grace, I think it's out of our control. Sister Teresa is inspiring young women to give selflessly to those who need service the most. Why would these young girls, who have their whole life ahead of them, give up everything to work for-- To work for what? I believe they think they are working for our Lord, Jesus Christ. For her own safety, and for the welfare of those girls, I think we ought to insist that Sister Teresa return to Loreto. I beg you, Your Grace, let her complete her year. At least let her do that. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Mabel. Hope you slept well. Good morning, Maria. A letter arrived for you. Thank you. Are you okay? I wrote to my parents to try to explain. They didn't even open it. We are your family now. There are plenty of people in Loreto who will welcome you back at the end of the year. The only problem is, you've got these young girls involved. Why should there be a problem? They live by strict rules, and as religious women, even though they're not nuns yet. Yes, they're well into their training as postulants. And when you disband, they'll be able to become novitiates of the Loreto Order. Disbanding? What about the work? We can't just abandon these people we are helping. But what are you going to do? Father, I'm going to apply for recognition as a congregation. (scoffs) The Vatican hasn't authorized a new congregation since 1850. They'll say your work can be taken over by lay people. No. There's a lot involved in getting recognized. You need to present a proposal, document your work, explain why a new order is required, write the constitutions. A proposal, documentation, constitutions. Father, come. Missionaries of Charity. You're brilliant. And this one? "Angel of the Slums." The local newspapers can't get enough of her. She even has the city council on her side because of the work she's doing. If her group is recognized as a congregation, Your Grace, four of our girls will qualify as novitiates. She's paid close attention to their religious-- Yes, yes, yes, yes. I see she proposes a fourth vow in addition to poverty, chastity, and obedience. That's what makes her order unique. It's not her order yet. "To give wholehearted and free service to the poorest of the poor. There are over 200 rules explaining the responsibilities and training for membership in her order. I did read these documents, Father. I leave for Rome next month. If, in the interim, I hear no negative reports of Sister Teresa's work... I'll take this application with me. But Your Grace, I... Oh, you mean you-- I mean, I-- Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you. (bells tolling) We are careful not to breathe in the scent of the flowers, Sister. It belongs to the goddess Kali. You see that man? He's a Brahmin, a holy man in charge of the temple. Where I grew up, there were many different religions-- Orthodox, Muslim, Catholic. We all worshipped in different ways. But as a child I always believed we were praying to same God. What's that building? It was the pilgrims' rest house. (gasps) This is the place for my hospital! It's perfect. The Brahmins will not stand for it, Sister. This is the holiest of places for us Hindus. Then it's already sacred ground for God's work. Look, we can have beds here and here. (door opening) Ah, Sister. The city council has no idea as to what kind of troublemaker you are. They give you permission to run amok in Calcutta, and I am the one who has to clean up the disaster. Just like in Moti Jihl. I thought that you and I had succeeded in stopping the disaster, Mr. Commissioner-- Sister, please. Don't try to whitewash your actions. What you did was incitement, encouraging the poor to resist authority. (scoffs) You can't hide your political agitations behind religious vows. Is teaching the uneducated and feeding the hungry now considered political agitation? All we are doing is providing a little of God's love, to make people's last days on Earth less painful. By making the slum a better place to live? No, a better place to die, Mr. Commissioner. So, you intend helping each and every one of the millions of sick and dying in Calcutta. How do you count to a million? That's my point, Sister, it takes forever. But where do you begin? One. That's where I am beginning. One, then two, then three. Already we have reached more than a hundred. And now you are seeking permission to move into the pilgrims' hostel. It has two sleeping rooms. It has electricity. It has connections for cooking. I am not interested in its pleasant features. The hostel is right next to one of the most enchanted, most revered shrines in Calcutta. How do you think Hindus will respond to your presence? Oh, I don't bring politics into charity, Mr. Commissioner. Sister! You are not the only kind-hearted person in Calcutta. You think no one else cares? This is my city, and every day I am brokenhearted to see our people dying in the streets. But for me, they're victims-- victims of colonialism and 300 years of Christian rule, which has blighted our country and our culture. Why don't we let God decide whether we should do our work here or not? All you have to do is open the way. ♪♪ The permission is provisional. And... if your presence causes trouble... the council will reconsider. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. (people singing) What's wrong, Sister? (sighs) The Albanian government have refused permission for my mother and my sister to leave the country. I'm so sorry. We must count our blessings, Sunita. (singing continues) Mabel said she'd go straight to Sister to give her your message. Oh, I'm only concerned about taking up your valuable time, Mrs. Goma. I'm used to waiting for Sister Teresa. Ah, here she is, back from the war front. I know you don't accept hospitality from anyone, as a rule. Please, Sister, can I make a cup of tea for you? Thank you, Mrs. Goma, I'm not thirsty. Is that true? The poor and the rich alike invite us to drink tea with them and to share their food. We would never take anything from people who have less than us. And to accept invitation only from the wealthy would offend the poor, so better say no to everyone. I'm sure that must frustrate a lot of people, Mother Teresa. Oh, I don't worry. Mother Teresa? (laughs) Desperate, the lost, the outcast. Taking care of them, rendering help to them, visiting them assiduously, living Christ's love for them, and awakening their response to His great love. Amen. God has triumphed through you, Reverend Mother Teresa. Welcome to the Calcutta diocese. Just Mother Teresa, Your Grace. I'm too small to carry so many names. (singing in foreign language) (girls) ...to quench the infinite thirst of Jesus Christ by wholehearted and free service to the poorest of the poor. Nursing the sick and dying destitutes, gathering and teaching street children. Visiting and caring for beggars and their children. Sheltering the abandoned, caring for the unwanted, unloved and lonely, living Christ's love in our spiritual work of mercy. (overlapping chatter) Sister Gertrude. We have been looking everywhere for you. I-- I was just thinking... My dear daughter! Mommy? Papa! How I wished I could have seen my family again. But God had other plans for me. You have no right to be here! You are desecrating this holy place! We are bringing the love of God to the dying. Not our God! Your God! Go back! Go back! (baby crying) Jyoti, take the baby to Sister Angela. Yes, Sister. Quickly. (protesters shouting) Mother! Mother, look! Don't let it distract you from your work. No, Mother. Ahh. Back up, back up. Calcutta's a pretty peculiar place for a holiday, if you ask me. Well... I can think of a lot worse. Actually, I'm here on a bit of a busman's holiday. I'm checking out the state of post-partition India-- oh. Well, while you're here, you should pay a visit to that nun I wrote to you about. You know, she's really not my kind of material, Stout. (clears throat) I'm a war correspondent, you know? Well, if ever there was a war to fight, she's found it, Harry. (horn honking, people shouting) Nirmal Hriday. What's that mean? That's "pure heart," "immaculate heart." It's Bengali. This woman has some guts. (shouting continues) (baby crying) She was dying in the gutter, Sister. She wouldn't even speak to me. And see, Sister? She was clutching the baby. Take her on inside, Manik. Move toes. Ahh! (overlapping chatter) What are they saying? They called Gandhi "Gandhiji," they're calling her "Sisterji." There she is. I'll see you a little later on. Um, excuse me? Uh, my name is Harry Harper of the International Chronicle. I'd like to talk with you. Oh, I have little time for talking, Mr. Harper. Excuse me, um, I would like to write about your work. The conflict between your Catholic Order and Hindu worshippers illustrates the contradictions here in India. All that matters is we are serving the poor. Yes, I know. But wouldn't you like the world to hear about your work? God's work, not my work. Mr. Harper, don't waste your time writing about me. I'm only an instrument. Write about the poor. All you have to do is open your eyes, your ears, your heart. (people coughing, groaning) Mother Teresa! Oh! Oh, the wound is infected with maggots. You must cut out all dead tissue. Yes, Mother. Ooh. (man retching) Ugh! (coughing) He'll infect me! Don't be afraid of them. First day, it's a shock. But you can get used to it. Never, not that. I thought I'd seen suffering in the war, but... Soon you'll be washing them and feeding them. You'll see. How is that mother they brought in a while ago? I don't think she'll make it. There's no life in her eyes. But the little one is fighting to survive. Beautiful baby. Now, what happens to her if the mother dies? I mean, who would take a sick baby like that? I've been thinking about that, too. Here, we have home for destitute dying. Now, what we need is home for destitute living. A home for children who have nowhere to go. How do you plan it all? We have no plan. We start our work where the suffering of the people calls us. We start right from the ground. (typewriter clicking) > Let's see here. "Dateline Calcutta. Today, near a temple to a fierce Indian goddess, I saw the face of human compassion." (groans) "Among the teaming masses of some of the poorest people on Earth, a bright light shines. Perhaps I saw the face of a saint today, as she bent over to change the bandages of a dying..." (sighs) Oh, Harry. (man groaning, coughing) Mother? Not to worry, we'll take care of you. Sister Agnes? He's a Brahmin. Yes, he's dying of TB. But the Brahmin want us evicted. They rejected him from every hospital in Calcutta. Don't worry, Jyoti. You are welcome here. (coughing) I won't die in this devilish house. I want to leave! Are you always in a hurry, Mother? There is a saying among missionaries. "If you want to preach successfully, you move your feet." They call us the running Sisters. Well, I don't think I'm fit enough to be a part of your order. But I-- I would like to help. If you'd let me have an interview... Do you know what we really need? A mobile clinic. Now, where would I find something like that? I don't know. "I'd like to tell the whole world, so all I want is an interview." Instead, she's sending me off on a mission. She's got under your skin, old boy. It's absurd. I mean, where am I gonna find a van? How much is something like that? Well, 100 pounds or so. Exactly. I'm not made out of money. I think I've got maybe ten pounds I can afford. I can't afford 100. Well... here. Change that little one up, you'll be up to 20. (laughs) (protestors shouting) How can you care for me when I despise you? Because I love you. I love you as God loves you. Hindus believe we suffer to pay for something we have done. (coughs) This is my time to understand God through my physical pain. Christ teaches us that even the good can suffer. Even the innocent. (coughing) Your God, when we see him on the cross, we ask, "What terrible thing did he do in his life to earn such a painful death?" Christ died on the cross to prove his greater love in action. He died for you. (people gasp, scream) I must go out there. I must talk to them. No, you can't! We have to get help. If they kill me... I will go to my God sooner. Attention! You are ordered to vacate the premises until your occupancy of Kalighat can be reviewed. If you don't do so voluntarily, you'll be removed by force! (cheering) Attention! What are we going to do? (protestors shouting) I warned you. And now... either you leave peacefully, or I will have all of you arrested. We have a lot of sick people in here who can't walk. If your plan is to remove us, perhaps you would like to see how many of us there are. But how can we? There is death in there. No, Mr. Commissioner. There is so much life. Come and see. All right. (protesters continue shouting) You realize that you'll all be arrested if you disobey the orders to vacate these premises? Yes. Arrangements have been made to move these patients to other facilities around Calcutta. We Indians are quite capable of taking care of our own. (flies buzzing) (people coughing, groaning) These patients will be removed to the city's facility for indigents, where... You-- you are taking care of him, too? Yes. Remember the words of Mahatma Gandhi. That you must think of the poorest and most helpless man we have ever seen. (coughing) We must ask ourselves if the step we contemplate is going to be of any use to him, what will the poor man gain from it? (coughing) Go out and tell your followers she is not welcome here. (coughing) ♪♪ (protestors shouting) I promised you that I will evict this woman. And I will. (cheering) I will evict the nuns as soon as I see you, your mothers, sisters, and wives come in here day in and day out to take over the work that they do here. (murmuring) (engine starts) (car horn honking) Pain? Hey! No pain here? Here? Not too tight, not too tight. Here, good man. Friend. Mother? Oh! I came to offer my congratulations. I won't be able to make the ceremony. Oh, I am only accepting for the poor, Mr. Harper. I'm only the instrument. Yes, yes. An international instrument working in over 30 countries. Ah, we are looking for new recruits, if you are interested. We have brothers working as missionaries too, you know. Oh, no, I'm too old and too wise, Mother. After what I've witnessed, the depth of wretchedness, extent of suffering, it's everywhere. But then I come here-- Mother, what happened to the legacy of Gandhi? I passed a statue on the way here, it's surrounded by soldiers and barbed wire. They need guns to protect a monument to a pacifist? I mean, if a man like Gandhi can't transform people-- Mr. Harper, come. I want to show you something. Come and see. This is Dr. Rama. He was a child in a leper colony. He got treatment because we were able to reach him. The money you raised for the mobile clinic has changed the lives of many more people like him. (sighs) What is it? Mother Teresa, what is it that you expect to achieve in your lifetime? More. More, more, always more. But don't you see? Your beloved poor, these-- these people that you call the blessed ones, are the result of a criminal failure of society. Isn't it better to correct the causes instead of treat the symptoms? Someone must comfort the poor. But that's the problem. With all due respect, Mother Teresa, Nobel Peace Prizes do little more than appease the conscience of the world. We can all shed a tear because someone like you is taking care of the needy. And then, when the speeches have been made, we go right on living our numb, ignorant lives. Maybe our work will inspire others who are better able to change conditions. Not if you continue to make the poor into some kind of a holy icon, Christ's body on Earth-- they're not Christ! What good is it to pretend that they're saints? We owe them everything. You have Western mentality. You expect too much from poor humanity. No, Mother, I-- I think you do. You expect infinite forgiveness. How can you forgive the violence, the corruption? Why don't you get angry? I get angry, Mr. Harper, I get angry often. When I find an abandoned child, I get angry. I got angry when I first saw Rama living in inhuman conditions. I get angry when I see young girls brutalized and raped during the wars. I am angry. But I have to forgive. Otherwise, how can I do the work? I forgive, but I don't accept. Well, I-- I don't understand, Mother. I don't think I ever will. Will you do one last thing for me, Mr. Harper, before you go? (man speaking foreign language) Come on, come on, come on, come on. (man continues speaking) Excuse me, excuse me? What-- what, uh-- what is he saying? (speaks foreign language) He's giving you his blessings. He was blessing me? Yes. I could buy him a million times over with the change in my pocket. Yes, but you couldn't buy his blessing. I never thought that I would, uh... when you cross that line. If I had not picked up that first person dying on the streets, I never would have picked up the thousands after. (patting leg) (applause) Welcome, Mother Teresa. On behalf of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee and the citizens of Oslo. His Majesty, the King, greets you and looks forward to meeting you personally at the ceremonial banquet. Banquet? Tomorrow night in your honor. Oh, please, have this banquet cancelled. Cancelled? Put aside the funds to feed the hungry and the poor in Calcutta. There, it can provide hundreds of meals for one whole year. All right? All right. Hello, beautiful child. God bless you. Mother Teresa? Mother Teresa? (overlapping chatter) Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. (applause) I accept this award for the glory of God, and in the name of the hungry, of the naked, of the homeless, of the crippled, the lepers, and the blind. In the name of all those who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for, humiliated. In their name, I accept this award, because it will bring an understanding love between the rich and the poor. Because all of us here, we are proclaiming to the poor that we love them, that they too have been created, by the loving hand of God, to love and to be loved. If we turn our back on the poor, we are turning our back on God. And at the hour of our death, we shall be judged by what we have done for and to the poor. God bless you all. (applause) ♪♪
