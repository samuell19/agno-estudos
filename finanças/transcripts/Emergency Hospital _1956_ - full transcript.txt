Emergency Hospital, may I help you? How long ago? What's her name? Address? Is this a house or an apartment? And your name, please? Yes, right away. [repeated buzzing] Attempted suicide. [switchboard ringing] Emergency Hospital, may I help you? [engine revving] [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [horns honking] [siren blaring] [engine roaring] [siren blaring] Are you okay back there? Yeah, what happened? Some guy just tried to cut us off! [engine roaring] What are ya mad about? One minute to eight, told you we would make it on time. I'm surprised you made it at all. Next time, we won't beat the ambulance, we'll be in it! Don't worry about it, one of the doctor's is a friend of mine. For you information, the ambulance had the right of way. You would've flown out of the car if I hit the brakes! You were doing 80! Practically crawling. You should see this baby on the freeway when I really open 'er up! Thanks-- I've seen it. [siren approaching] Hey-- Is that a way to say good night? [siren winding down] Good evening, Jack.Dr. Carey. Will.Dr. Carey. What ya bring in? Sleeping beauty. Looks young. 18, married and pregnant. Here we go again! Yes, Dr. Ellis, I found this next to her bed. Norma, check this prescription, will ya please? Yes, Doctor. Fran, would you check the pharmacy for this prescription? Be glad to. That from the girl just brought in?Oh, yes, yes it is. Will you call her apartment every fifteen minutes or so, Fran, until you contact her husband? All right, Sergeant. Oh, it's a fine time to be starting work isn't it? Well, respectable women are home with their kids at this hour of night. Oh, you call yourself respectable? I wouldn't trust any man who carries a revolver even if he does wear a badge! Well, that was your big mistake, not trusting a man. Yep! You coulda settled down and made somebody real unhappy.Oh. [man calling] Miss Mullen? You know what she gave Jimmy for his birthday? I'm all ears. A movie camera, projector screen, the whole works. She's gonna spoil that boy of mine. What's a Godmother for? Heart trouble, Sylvia? Coronary thrombosis, I know all the signs. Pains down my left arm, tightening of the chest, and my breath comes short. Oh, wait a minute! Didn't you tell me a couple a days ago that you had an electrocardiogram? Oh, yes. It's not my heart. [coughing] It's my lungs! Well, maybe it's a little cough from the night air. A little cough? The least it could be is tuberculosis. Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if this means spending the rest of my life in a sanitarium. What about those chest x-rays you had taken last week? Oh, that's right. It couldn't be tuberculosis, unless the technician got my x-rays mixed up with somebody else's. Here, Sylvia? [woman over P.A.] Dr. Ellis, telephone.Oh, Doctor, have I got something bad? Well, um, it a, it could be an inflammation of the pleura. Pleurisy! Everybody gets that! And besides, I've already been on octon-cortisone. It's right here, Doctor... Well, how did you hurt it, Sylvia? I was reaching for a bottle of... fruit juice. Well, you must've pulled a muscle. Oh, a pulled muscle. Myositis. Myositis? Right that on my chart, Mitzi. Myositis. I knew I had something bad! Well, we'll make it better, that's what we're here for, isn't it?Yes. Uh, give Sylvia the, um, thiabaxomiacin pills. Now you take good care of yourself, Sylvia. Thanks, Doctor! You're the best! Myositis... Thiabaxomiacin... Over there. Your name? Earl Fanmorn. Address? 521 South Maple Drive. Age?18. Male. Are you married or single? Holy smokes, Lady! My head's cut 'n you wanna know my life history! Look-- None of your sass! Are you the boy's father? Unfortunately! Are you single, Earl? Yes. And, your occupation? I'm a college professor! I told you none of your sass! Never mind. Come on. We'll take a look at that head. Do you mind waiting out here? I certainly do! After you're finished, the police get 'm! Take his coat, will you? Get up on the table. Oh-- That's a mean cut! What happened? Nothing. [father] Ha, he calls breaking into a store and stealing, nothing! Well, you just rest right there. I'll get the doctor. Hello, Norma. Oh, thank you. [switchboard ringing] Emergency Hospital, may I help you? Your husband has arthritis of the stomach and needs an epidemic? I'm sorry, but we only give emergencies. Call your own doctor, or the city health department in the morning. Got a buster in two with a hole in his head, and his father who could use one. Send the Hospital Detail will you? Here's the information on that prescription. Thank you. [over P.A.] Hospital Detail. Hospital Detail. Room two please. Hospital Detail. Hospital Detail-- Room two please. Yes, Norma? Barbiturate, grain and a half. How many? 18 when she got the prescription, and that was about six weeks ago, Dr. Ellis. Five cc's of Benzedrine. That oughtta wake her up. Mitzi, want me to help you wash her out? If you're not busy. Well, first I'll take a look next door. [Janet] Don't worry, son, this won't hurt you. Suture setup please. I want a doctor for this. You've got one.Who are you trying to kid? Nobody, son.Lie back. Lay down and be still. Are you a doctor? I'm a detective. Well, good! Now, what's you problem, son? [father] What isn't his problem? Stealing from his own father-- That's what! How da ya like that? How'd ya hurt your head? Tryin' to go over a transom. You wanna tell me what happened? Well, I have an exclusive men's store and we live upstairs. Earl here is a big shot with the girls and he needed some money. But he didn't know I had an alarm system installed in my store. Oh, is this the first time? First time he got caught? Ever do it before, son? No, Sir. How can you take a thief's word? Why'd ya do it? Well, when you get to be 18, you're not a kid anymore. A fella has to have some fun. Ever try working? All through high school. Every Saturday, every vacation. Why shouldn't he help around the store? After all, it costs plenty these days for an education! And an education he'll get! At a reform school! You're not gonna prosecute him? I'm a tax payer, I have my rights! But, he's your own son. So, he'll learn his lesson while he's young. You know what it means to have your fingerprints taken at police headquarters? Every place he goes, the army, applying for a job, it'll always be on the record. A good reminder, if you ask me, to keep his nose clean from now on. He'll have a reminder for the rest of his life. A scar. Sure, maybe it'll only be a little mark there on his forehead. But every morning when he looks in the mirror to shave, he'll see it, even if nobody else does. This the first time you've ever had any real trouble with him? There'll be a scar doctor? It's hard to say. Everybody heals differently. A big one? Depends, Mr. Fanmorn, on bone structure, tissues, even his own ancestry. Well, don't worry about it Earl. It's just a little mark, it's nothing. A little powder'll cover it up. Can't it? Oh, sure. You feel dizzy, Earl? Can we go now? Yes. Unless Earl isn't up to it. Officer? It's your decision, mister. We'd better go home. Your mother will be worried. Thanks. There ya go, Paul. Poking your kisser into everybody's business. What are you running for, mayor? That kid wasn't a hoodlum, he's still a youngster, and given half a chance... He'll steal half the world. No, they're not all like your Jimmy. Heredity is what counts. Isn't that true, Doctor? Like father, like son. Environment means a lot too. It's like I said, Norma. All the boy needs is a chance. A chance to what? That guy's got too much heart. Good thing he's a cop and not a doctor. Patient in one, Doctor. Will I need you? I don't think so, he has something in his eye. Well, help Mitzi, will ya, Vera? All right, Doctor. [siren blaring] How are ya? Something in your eye, uh, Mr. Caldwell? Yeah, that's right. But there's nothing you can do about it. It's a sparkle, Doctor. And I was hoping Dr. Carey would look after me. Was she expecting you?Well... not exactly. You know how it is? I'll tell 'er you're here. Oh, Doctor. Yes. Don't tell 'er it's me, please. All right. Comfortable? We're trying to locate your husband. No! I don't want to see him ever! Now, just rest, Mrs. Johnson. But don't sleep. Would you like a cup of coffee? No, I don't want nothin'. Oh, um, I'm going to keep her in minimum security. Would you mind looking at the patient in one? Not at all, Doctor. Good evening, Dr. Carey. My favorite patient. Your impatient patient. Don't tell me you were in an accident. Yep! I ran right into a hard-headed girl. Doctor, can you patch a broken heart? I don't think that could ever happen to you. You're so wrong! Ben!Janet. Ben, please. There are people here who really need me. Count me among the first. This isn't the time or the place! So, they put an M-D after your name and everything becomes a clinical record. Like this. Was patient able to answer questions intelligently? Maybe the doctor ought to start thinking intelligently. I... I have been thinking, Ben. And you still want to stay in a joint like this and take care of all these characters? When I can set ya up in Beverly Hills and introduce you to... There are enough doctors in Beverly Hills. And enough characters too! Every time I try to help you. [woman on P.A.] Dr. Ellis, telephone. Dr. Ellis, telephone. Someday I'm going to give up. I wish you would. There used to be a woman under that doctor's wraparound. There still is. But after eight years of studying and two of interning, you... you can't separate the woman from the doctor. Not even with a wedding ring? [sighing] You still sore about the way I drove here? It-it wasn't smart. Janet. Janet, what made you become a doctor? No, I mean it-- Why are you a doctor? Well, I, I always wanted to be one, I suppose. Not for the money? The glory? Well, if you call helping people, glory? Maybe that's your answer. I don't know, Ben. [siren approaching]My... my father was an attorney, my mother a teacher before I was born. I went to school, kept on going to school, and... and we decided that I would be something. It was my choice, not theirs. And you like it? Sure, I like it. It gives me a... A deep satisfaction? A thrill, maybe? A sense of power when you accomplish something? Yes. Yes, that's it. That's it exactly. That's just the feeling I get when I'm behind the wheel of a car. Putting life into a man-made engine. [woman on P.A.] Hospital Detail...That sense of power you get, I get it every time I push the throttle to the floor and leave everything in my wake! There are more important things, Ben. Not to me, there aren't. I worked for my money. I made it in cars and I'm gonna spend it in cars. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's gotta be. [woman on P.A.] Dr. Carey, please. Dr. Carey report to room three, please. An emergency? [sighing] Janet... are you coming back? I-- I'm busy. Busy doing what I think is important. Bullet wound in the stomach. Oh! Ma-- ma-- madr-- madre mia. Let's go swimming. [Paul] Ramon? Doctor? I'm not a doctor, Ramon. I'm a detective. Now, who shot ya? Ramon, do you know who shot ya? Don't let 'em get away with it. No. Doctor? I'll have to probe for the bullet before I can tell anything. Ramon, do ya have any enemies? Someone who might want to hurt ya or kill ya? DelGato. Pepe DelGato? Si. He couldn't have done it, Ramon. Pepe DelGato's in prison. He's gonna pay with his life soon. How bad, Doctor? [Ramon] Ma... You know DelGato? Si. And Alfred Flores? Flores! The lottery king! The man DelGato stabbed to death! No, no, not DelGato. How do you know? Because... I... I kill him. You killed Flores? The lottery. He wanted to squeeze me out. What about DelGato? I use his knife. Is he gonna make it? It was only a superficial wound. Without hemorrhaging, he'll be all right in a couple a weeks. Mr. Corden? [Ramon] Yes, Doctor? The bullet's out. You'll be all right. I-- I be all right? It was a clean wound, Mr. Corden. Only the skin and tissues, no vital organs. No-- I be all right? I thought I was gonna die! Maybe ya are, Ramon! That'll be up to the jury! It's not so! What I say, you cannot prove! We've got an efficient police department, Ramon! I think we'll be able to make everything hold up just like ya said. Lie back, Mr. Corden before you tear this wound open! I don't care! My life, she's over-- I don't want to live! A couple a minutes ago, you didn't wanna die! Now you don't wanna live! You want him hospitalized?Yes. Otherwise he'll damage himself. Ramon, you're going to the County Hospital, so be a good boy. Not to jail? Se?or, when I was dyin' I was 'fraid. I didn't mean to confess! But ya did! And I'm bookin' you for the murder of Alfred Flores. Ah, Madre, Madre mia. [woman on P.A.] Dr. Carey, please. Dr. Carey report to room three, please. [switchboard ringing] Emergency Hospital, may I help you? Lil-- What are you doing up at 2:00 in the morning? I thought only us poor working folk were awake at this hour. Oh, well don't worry about that, you know how kids are. [switchboard ringing] There's a call comin' in, hon, I'll get Paul for you. [over P.A.] Hospital Detail, desk please. Emergency Hospital, may I help you. When was he bitten by the dog? That was 14 hours ago, lady! We'll be glad to give him emergency treatment, but we don't give the pastory treatment here. Nell's on the phone. I'll take it at the desk. Call Michigan 5-2-1-1 and ask for the animal regulation department in the morning. The dog will be quarantined, and the City Health Department will take care of the boy if necessary. You're welcome. Here he is Lil. Hello, Lil. Oh, he's probably spending the night with one of the fellas. Well, I-- I told you not to let him have the car tonight. Okay, dear... Go to bed. He's not a child anymore, he'll be home soon. All right, dear. Good bye. Yes? Someone sent for me-- I'm Harry Johnson. Let me have that spindle, dear. What is your wife's name?Marie. This is the second time she did a thing like this. [switchboard ringing] Emergency Hospital, may I help you? No, ma'am, you do not drink insecticide for butterflies in your stomach. Call your own doctor, and he will give you a prescription. Vera, this is Mr. Johnson, Marie Johnson's husband. Is she... is she dead? She's perfectly all right. Come on, I'll take you to her. Oughtta be ashamed, a big girl like her always threatening to kill herself. Did you hear that punk, Fran? [switchboard ringing]Says she ought to be ashamed. There oughtta be a law against... May I help you? Los Feliz Boulevard, East of Vermont. This is nine. We're sending an ambulance on a T call to Los Feliz Boulevard, East of Vermont. What is your number? Auto crash? Somebody ran into a pole. How do ya like that kid? What do they get married for, if they want the responsibility? [siren sounding] Always feelin' sorry for yourself, ain't ya? It wasn't me I was sorry for, Harry. It was the baby. What baby? Mine. I'm gonna have a baby. You're gonna have a baby? If you woulda stayed home more instead of goin' out every night, playin' poker and drinkin' beer, you woulda known about it long before this! Holy smokes, Marie! You don't have to knock yourself off just 'cause you're pregnant! I'll take care a the kid. Sure-- Like you took care of everything else I ever had! My friends, the money I saved before we were married, even my self-respect! Agh, don't blow your top at me!Now, get out of here! I don't want any part of you, and neither does my baby! Your baby-- It's just as much mine as it is yours! Don't bet on it!Why, you little tramp! Get out of here! Get out of...Where do ya think you are? You want everybody to here ya? What's the matter? Agh, she's flippin' 'er lid! I told you I didn't wanna see him! He's nothing but trouble! Trouble!What did I tell ya? The dame is sproutin' wings for the cuckoo factory! Come on, fella! She's got her hands full.Okay, okay! It's your baby, but don't ask me for one lousy penny! Come on, fella-- Let's go. Quit shovin'-- Who do ya think you are? I'm a policeman, who do you think you are? [sobbing] I wish I were that girl's brother or father, I'd give you the beating of your life. Real tough, ain't ya-- Just 'cause you got a badge. You bring her any more trouble and I'll show you how tough I can be! Yeah? Sergeant? [disgruntled cooing] What's her H-P-D? She said she stumbled with the baby in her arms. What do you think, Doctor? I doubt it. The child has bruises on both sides of her shoulders, on both legs and behind the head as well as on the face. Mitzi, will you clean the child? I'll get right back to her after I take a look at the mother. Sit her down will ya, Barney? [yelping] What's that? Alcohol? If it burns your skin, what do ya think it does to the lining of your stomach? Now, what happened? I fell.How many times? Once. How come you got one little cut and the baby's bruised all over? You know your name? I ain't that drunk.What is it? Anna Banks. See, honey, I ain't drunk. How drunk do you have to get to beat up a little baby? [crying] I'll take her home now. I'm afraid not. She's going to the Children's Hospital. And you're goin' to the gray bar hotel. Who are you kiddin'? That's just a fancy name for jail! So you've been there before, huh? Me? What for-- Child beating? [crying] Stinkin' little monster! All she does is cry, cry, cry! Make 'er stop! Watch it! [baby continues crying] Will she be all right, Doctor? That's the doctor. Doctor. She has a concussion, if there's internal hemorrhaging, I... Dear God. Let's go. Did you get rid of him, Sergeant? Oh, that Johnson fella?Mmm-hmm. Yeah, he gave her the business, didn't he? Maybe this'll snap her out of it. She needed a good shock. How is she? She's not gonna die? I'm only the doctor. You seem upset. It's a little baby. Grown ups-- I-I understand things happening to them, but, but a baby... Would you like some coffee? I'd like that. I'll be in the coffee room. Emergency Hospital, may I help you? What was that last name again? M-I-N-T-E-R? The first name is George? How long has he been missing? We have no record of a George Minter here. Why don't you try the Valley Receiving Hospital at State 5-2-1-2-1? You're welcome. I-- I just don't understand something! Most people can't understand themselves. That woman! Imagine, beating her own little baby! Agh, you can't let that faze you. Things could get worse as the night wears on. All bad cases so far. Except one-- A man. Had something in his eye. Oh?Uhuh. Looked familiar. Maybe his, uh, picture in the paper? You've seen his picture in the paper many times. His name is Ben Caldwell. Oh, he's that, um, that racing car enthusiast isn't he? Enthusiast is hardly the word for it. Successful, personable, good looking. Mr. Caldwell is going to make some woman a very fine husband. Or a distraught wife. I've seen too many hot rodders end up here with broken bones. Some aren't that lucky. I don't want my husband brought in here on a litter. You call an $8,000 Mercedes a hot rod? When they slap an oxygen mask over your face, they don't ask if the car cost $8 or 8,000. Yes, maybe you're right. [Fran on P.A.] Doctor, please. Doctor report to the office please. Doctor, please.I'll get it. All right.Thanks for the coffee. Doctor, please report to the office, please. She's coming out of shock. I'll be with her father. Call me, will you? Mr. Northrop? Where's my daughter-- How is she? We've just completed our examination, she'll be all right. She'll be all right? Yes, she's in the treatment room. You can take her home after a while. I still don't know what happened. She was attacked. Someone tried to rob her? No, Sir. Somebody tried to rape her. Rape her! A 16-year-old girl? She hasn't been badly hurt, Mr. Northrop, but if she sees you so excited... [Norma] Dr. Carey? Uh, excuse me, please. [whispering] Uh, Mr. Northrop... You can see her now. Miriam, I'm Dr. Carey. I want to assure you that no damage has been done. I-- I'm not gonna have a baby? No, Miriam. I'm so ashamed! [father] There's nothing to be ashamed of, dear. It wasn't your fault, Miriam. You're still a child. [crying] What's in that bottle? Glucose to counteract the shock. You're sure she's all right? How do you mean? Well, the shock? She's all right. Nothing else wrong? I examined her thoroughly, there is no cause to worry, though I-I suggest that you take her to your own doctor tomorrow. Of course. Miriam, do you want to go home now? I'll wait outside while you get dressed. Mr. Northrop?Yes. This is Sergeant Arnold. He's on Hospital Detail. Police.Did you find out what happened? Yes, Sir. Your daughter was babysitting for a family two doors from your own home. The Nelsons. A relief milkman, knowing the Nelsons left the back door open to the pantry, entered the house. His motivation was robbery, but when he saw your daughter... If I ever get my hands on him, he... He's already in custody. The law'll take care of him. You'll prosecute, of course? And get a lot of sensational publicity? No thanks. I'll send my daughter away to a private girl's school. [Norma] Running away won't help her. It'll hurt her. Hurt her-- To forget? If you send her away, she'll always be ashamed to come back. To face her friends, it'll be a stigma. She has to face them if she stays, doesn't she? Let her resume her normal activities. Get back into the swing of things again. Give this thing a chance to wear off, that's all. That's not all! A lot of publicity now won't do my business any good. Well, how much is your business worth, Mr. Northrop? Half million dollars, roughly. Well, roughly, how much is your daughter worth? All right, Sergeant, I'll prosecute. And you needn't worry about the publicity, Mr. Northrop. Whenever there's a minor involved, the newspapers never identify them. You sure your all right, dear? Please, let's get out of here. [siren approaching]Now don't worry, Miriam. There's only one thing to do. Try to forget it. How much do I owe you, Doctor? Uh, nothing. Well, whom do I pay? Nobody, Mr. Northrop. This is a city hospital, your tax dollars support us. Everything?That's right. Well, there's no reason why I can't show my appreciation to you. No, thanks. We're paid by the city. You learn something every day. Anyway, thanks very much, for both of us. You're very welcome. I'll take you down to your car. [elevator buzzing] In that one, room three. Traffic? A young kid. Would you mind calling a juvenile officer please? Oh, not at all. Juvenile? This is Miss Mullen, upstairs. We've got a T case for you. Room three. Do you have his I-D?The officer has it. What happened, Officer? Speeding, lost control of his car, smacked into a pole. Do you have his name? Mmm-hmm. James Arnold.What? Jimmy! Jimmy... Doctor. No fractures, Norma. This is Paul's son. Yes, I know. Sergeant Arnold's boy? Yes. He's on Hospital Detail. Is it very bad? Concussion, maybe. Can't tell yet. Norma. It's nothing but a scratch. How do you feel, Jimmy? Where's my father? Wait for the J-O. [Juvenile Officer] Right here. This the driver of the smash up on Los Feliz? Yes, two other boys were brought in by the squad car. They're downstairs, I just talked to them. Can he be questioned? I think he's all right. Jimmy? He's Paul's son. Sergeant Arnold. Jimmy? Want to tell me what happened? Not until my father gets here. This is my case, Jimmy. Not his. [doctor] His father's too busy anyway. What did happen, Jimmy? I ran the car smack into a pole so the police would get us. You want to start at the beginning? Okay. [siren approaching] We had a little gang, called ourselves the Four Musketeers. We weren't exactly a gang, but we weren't angels either. We'd swipe cigarettes and stuff like that. Just for the kicks. The other guys wanted to pull a real caper tonight, rob a liquor store. Well, I wouldn't go for it, so Banister, he's the leader, pulled a gun on me, said "If I didn't go through with it, he'd blow my brains out!" So there it was, get my head bashed in or wreck the car. That's it. Well, that's not what the fellas downstairs said. Sure, they're sore at me. Said "I was chicken." No, they said the holdup was your idea. And that you thought you could get away with it by using your father's car. You believe them? They said "You were the leader."Me? [siren blaring]It was Banister! Get him up here, I'll make him talk! Afraid that's impossible. Banister was killed. [siren stops] I'd better tell Paul. No, I'll tell him. Norma, what do ya say we dress this wound? [officer] Paul! Mike! What happened-- Fall of your bike again? I brought a young kid in this time, Paul. Well, he's not exactly a kid. A young fellow. He ran his car into a pole, however he... he wasn't hurt very badly. Lucky! The other fellow with him wasn't so lucky. Banged his head against the dashboard. In there? In the morgue. The boy in there is... Paul it's... it's Jimmy, your boy. Jimmy... Wait a second, Paul! I told you he wasn't hurt very badly. But he's in an awful lot of trouble. For reckless driving? Look, Mike, these things have been worked out before. I've never seen 'em bring a dead boy back to life, Paul. Well, accidents happen all the time. Some people get killed, some get hurt. Who was driving? Jimmy-- Your car. Well, o-okay, so the car skidded and ran into a pole, you can't condemn the boy for that! Look, Paul...Now, just a minute! There are two ways you can make out your report. One, you can make it look bad, speeding, reckless driving. Two, you can get him out of it! Say that he, he swerved to avoid a pedestrian or another car! You been a cop too long to talk like that, Paul. Nineteen years! Two years before Jimmy was born. I'm entitled to some kind of consideration. Oh, anything I can do, Paul, that's right, you know that... All right, Jimmy. Is he dressed? You can come in now. Don't move! Stay where you are, Norma! Now raise your hands. Better do what he says. You and the doctor, over against the wall. Jimmy, give me that gun before you get in deeper. I'm already over my head! It can get worse, Jimmy. So will you if you don't shut up! Norma, over here. The other side! That's far enough!Jimmy... Please. Please, what? Take the rap for somebody else? No thanks! Now turn around. Jimmy. How do you expect to get out of here? With you and him leading the way. And Norma right in front of me. Well-- What are you waiting for? Come on. Wait a minute. Any tricks, she gets it first. Let's go. Jimmy! Where do ya think you're going? To get my wife, and I'd like to see ya stop me! Then take a good look! Come on-- Come on! Shut up! Look, I'm a citizen and you're just a cop, and don't you forget that! I'm just a cop! But you're a punk-- Don't forget that! I'm goin' out the fire escape, don't anybody try to stop me. All right, Norma, get going! Everybody out there. You too, Norma. Jimmy-- Gimme that gun! Not a chance. I'm comin' to get it!Don't! Listen to me, Jimmy. I'm your father, I can help ya. Nobody can help me! I'll get ya the best lawyer. I got pull! They're tryin' to railroad me! Now, don't come any closer, I'm warning you! [gun fires, shattering] I'm too good a shot to miss. Next time, I won't! [switchboard ringing] I told ya, don't come any closer! You'll never get it open. Then you will. I can't let ya escape, son. Do what I say! All right, Jimmy. No-- Don't! [gun fires] Oh, sorry! Didn't know you were here. Come on in, we're all doctors under the skin. Well, speaking as a non-professional, the difference ends right there. Dr. Carey. You, uh, must have a first name? It's Janet. Which proves you're a woman. But I've known that for a year. Been a whole year, hasn't it! Since we've been at the hospital! Almost. You've been going with that fella, that, um... Ben Caldwell?All this time? Just about. How much longer you gonna hang on? It's all over, Dave. He walked out tonight, I- I don't think he'll be back. Well, he might. Men are creatures of impulse. It doesn't matter. Ben and I have nothing in common. Like, uh, medical careers? Light? Thank you. You know, some men fall in love with, uh, sparkplugs, tires, crank cases... And some with sutures and scalpels. All right, I'm a doctor. What's more important, I'm a man. When I want something... [Fran on P.A.] Dr. Carey, please. Dr. Carey, please. An O-B call. To be continued. Well, uh, how 'bout having breakfast with me? Morning can be as lonesome as night, can't it? I know. I've been eating breakfast alone too long now. It's an O-B in the Silver Lake district, Doctor. Oh, you all ready? All set, Doctor.Let's go then. [sirens blaring] Well, I gave him a sedative. He'll sleep it off. What about the foot? It's only a flesh wound. He won't have to be hospitalized. Paul, about the revolver. I spoke to the others, we won't put it in the record. Thanks. Okay if I stay for a while? Sure. When he wakes up, he's going to need you. [siren blaring] You got here fast! Not us, we're racing the stork. Looks like a bad one. One D-B, five others banged up. Can you give us a hand? We'll ask the doc-- She's in the back. You the doctor?What's up? Motorcycle and three cars. One's a sports job, a Mercedes I think. The Mercedes, where is it? Over there. Here's your kit, Doctor. You and Vera go ahead with the ambulance. [siren blaring] Doctor! [groaning] This woman's coming to. [groaning continues] Morphine? [siren approaching] There's the ambulance I called for. This'll hold her till she gets to the hospital. She's the woman whose husband was killed. That guy is lucky or he wore his safety belt. Let's get him out of there. Over here! We've got five live ones to carry-- that's right isn't it? Right. And one man dead. I'll radio for another ambulance. Bet I ruined your car. Oh, it doesn't matter, I can always buy a new one. But a new son. If... if anything happened to him... Fine son you're worried about. The way I let ya down. It's the other way around. I let you down. Working nights, sleeping days. Not being around when you needed me. It's not enough to have a cop in the family, it's more important to have a father. [siren blaring] Dad, did I louse up your career? You didn't hurt it at all. Look, son, I... I know the truth. I talked to the two boys downstairs. 'Bout how Ed Banister forced you to drive at gunpoint and why you wrecked the car. Some of the things you did were wrong, but I-I'm glad you knew where to draw the line, even if it meant this. Don't worry, Dad. I'll take my punishment. We'll take it together. I'll come back for you. [Janet] What some people won't do for sympathy. I'm getting attached to this place. What hurts, Ben? My Mercedes. Uh, they're ready for the transfusion in three. Mind staying a minute, Sergeant, till one of the nurses gets here? Sure. I'll be back as soon as I can. [groaning] Can you hear me? M-my corn. It hurts so awfully. Vera, take off her shoes. Yes, Doctor. It's always the little things that bother folk. How is she? She's holding her own. What about the other woman? Mrs. Gibler? She's taking a nap. We'll put the young fellow in four. Keep an eye on one, will ya? Vera, give Dr. Carey a hand. I'll take another look at Mr. Wilson in two. Why can't I have a cigarette? I'm sorry, mister, there's no smoking in the treatment rooms. Rules are made to be broken. [Norma] Not here they're not. How do ya feel? Like getting out of this place. Wait a minute. The doctor'll be back in a jiffy. Jimmy?He's all right. He'll be going home with me, but that's not the end of it. Don't take it out on him, Paul. I'm not blaming the boy, Norma. He's only a kid. I'll stick right with him through juvenile court if he has to appear. Count me in, huh? And then I'm going to transfer to the juvenile squad. Now that I know what it's like to be on the other side of the fence. When I see what can happen to kids... well, maybe I can help some of them the way I'm gonna help Jimmy. [groaning] Just try to take it easy, Mr. Wilson. Can he be questioned? May I have your name, please? Robert Wilson. Were you in the other car? Yes, Sir. Me and my wife were... where is my wife? How is she? We're trying to take care of everybody, Mr. Wilson. As fast as we can. Were you driving? No, Sir. Frank Stuber, he's my brother-in-law. It was his car. What happened-- Do you know? We had a blowout and went over into the oncoming traffic. We hit a boy on the motorcycle. That boy! That boy! He's all right, Mr. Wilson. We killed that boy-- We killed him! The boy is in four. Take it easy. How do ya feel? Could be worse, Doc. I'm a detective. Oh, it wasn't my fault. I was just...I know. The car had a blowout. Oh, was that it? I thought they were drunk. So many drunks on the freeway. Man I'm lucky that other guy didn't run over me! What other guy? The fella in a fancy sports job. Comin' right at me after I landed on the freeway. He swerved and crashed his car so he wouldn't hit me. Boy, I was shakin' hands with the angels! What's your name? Harry Alverson. I wish I knew his. I'd sure like to shake his hand. His name is Caldwell. Ben Caldwell. The Playboy? The Sportsman. Paul, do you know who's in four? Dr. Carey, fella with a busted shoulder. Who's in one? The man who drove the sports car, Ben Caldwell. Thanks. What are you doing up? He wants to leave. No law against it. No, we can't hold a man here against his own wishes. Couple a bruises, that's all. I'd like to give you a more thorough check up. No, thanks, but I'll see my own doctor later. Norma, will you get Mr. Caldwell's card please? Guess I won't get to the desert today after all. Was planning on some time trials. You mean you were getting up at six o'clock this morning for that? Up, nothing, haven't been to bed yet. Well, you'll have plenty of time to rest, now that your Mercedes is out of commission. Ah, you don't know my mechanic. Two months, we'll be in the Torey Pines Races. You're kidding. Watch the news reels. Thanks. Would you sign here, please, Mr. Caldwell? Complete examination refused. You want my John Henry under that? Please. Thank you. Thank you, Norma. [elevator buzzing] Thanks, Doctor. He-- he shouldn't leave here alone! It was his idea, Janet. Come on, I'll buy you a quick cup of coffee. Do you know what he did? Who? Ben. He purposely wrecked his car so he wouldn't hit that young fellow. [whistling] He risked his life. If anything ever happened to him... You wouldn't become Mrs. Caldwell. Mrs. Caldwell. Thanks for the coffee! You're welcome. Emergency Hospital, may I help you? Was either one killed? I see. Yes. We'll send an ambulance over right away. What is that address please? Thank you. This is three. We're sending an ambulance to eight 16 Palmetto. Two men shot each other. You're welcome. Why do they always wait for morning? Doesn't anything happen at night? [switchboard ringing] Emergency Hospital, may I help you? [siren blaring]
