Look, I know you had to get a second job. Look, I didn't plan on raising my brother's children! And I understand those children had a hard summer. I cannot have violence in my school. They watched they parents get killed! Look, the only time he's violent is when he's protecting Charlotte, okay? Look, where's the other boy, let me ask him! No, I'll talk to him. But that doesn't change much. You have got to get a handle on William or he cannot stay here anymore. Okay, I will, all right, I promise! Wait, Ms. Palmer. The fights are just a part of it. William isn't talking at all and his teachers are concerned. And Charlotte. Charlotte. What the hell you want? Let me see the gun. It's grown man shit, you think you can handle this? Man, let me see the gun. You know your brother don't want you playing with no guns. Man, fuck that nigga. Let me see this. Have you ever shot somebody before though? Watch this shit. Man, give me this. I tried to tell you niggas. Ya'll gonna split it? Good Lord. Damn. How you doing, Charlotte? What's up, Junk, you can call me Charlie. Hell no, Nigga.

He don't ever let me have no fun. Shit is irritating. He's just trying to protect you, Charlotte. From what? So, it's cool for him to be out here just living it up, doing whatever, but I can't even chill on a porch and have a drink? Look, now you know he has always looked out for you, but Dub lives a dangerous life. Look, and we just don't want you around that. Hell, I don't want you around it, he don't want you around it! Just not today, okay! It's not even that bad over here. Come on, now. Now is that anyway for a future lawyer to be talking? You wanna go to church with me? Where the fuck this nigga at, Man?

Real shit, you pay way too much money for that type of shit to happen. Bro. What the fuck happened? Shit, I don't know, we was on the phone and we didn't get no full details and shit, but she was basically was saying she pulled up in front of one of my spots, was chilling. They pulled up on her, shook her down, took her back. Where she at now? She at her girl house. She say they didn't fuck her up or nothing, she cool. Right, right, you saying her. Nigga, you got a bitch working for you? Yeah, Nigga! I see it's been a while. Listen Dog, she my lieutenant man, and she do a damn good motherfucking job, Man. I mean, that's fine, Bro.

Bro, that's probably why 5-0 fucking with her. All on how she look. Cuz, man, that shit don't matter. She can hold her motherfucking own. I mean, let's be real, dog, you think I'd have her out there if she couldn't handle this shit? Dub, I know you don't wanna hear this shit, My Dog, she puts in that work. Look, I don't give a fuck who working for you. As long as they loyal and ain't dumb. Right now, Dude, that sound like some dumb shit. You got a bitch trying to play the role of a nigga, that ain't doing nothing but putting a mark on you. How much they hit her for? She said a couple hundred. She had just finished doing the drop so, that's the good thing. Ain't worth going to war. Nah. Oh, hell nah, we don't need no war. But at the end of the day, we do need to remind the motherfuckers what it is. Man, look, right now, I'm about to expand this, all right. And we don't need no issues right now. Look, next week we go see Matteo and I damn sure don't want no issues with them. (Mumbles) Mitchell. Shit, mean, we can at least make sure they follow the protection agreement we got with them. Man, them motherfuckers just want some more chicken, Man. Mitchell ain't ever satisfied. Man, shit, he's never lied either. But like I said, we don't need no more issues. It's not worth going to war over, not that amount of money. Hey, matter of fact, go handle that for me. Dub, are you coming? I'll be there in a minute. Bro. What, Nigga? She serious? Nigga, is she here for all of us? Would you calm your hiding dick ass down? No, Nigga, she mine, damn, Man. What the fuck wrong with him? Hey, you know the bitch special, he got her in the track.

Look, I am not gonna ruin your little perfect GPA. I'm going to do the reading. But I'm saying, it's Saturday night. My auntie want me to go to church, my brother think I'm supposed to just sit in the house and do nothing, and you want me to read. I just wanna have some fun. Okay, Dear, I'll be ready in an hour. Now where you think you're going? You know Dub don't like you dressing like no street ho! Dub introduced us to a street ho tonight. Now, if his girl can dress like this, I for damn sure can. Plus, I look good. Charlotte! Look, my date is here so don't wait up. Look, you better watch yourself before you fighting a man up off of you! That's only if I'm lucky. Damn, I said a couple drinks but you come out dressed like you ready for a music video. But I ain't complaining. So, you like it? Hell yeah I like it. But we may be a little over dressed for the party in my neighborhood. Okay, so let's go somewhere else! Look, I got plenty money, I'm trying to turn up. Well, we can't get all the way turned up. We gotta study for school tomorrow. All right, how about we get halfway turned up? What? 3/4 turned up? Demar. All right, fuck it, we getting all the way turned up.

Is it that serious? Hell yeah it's that serious. You know motherfuckers gonna try her. In return, that's gonna make us look weak. Shit, if a motherfucker try to rob her, they gonna have to come see me. So, you gonna get rid of her? Nah, he vouched for her. And besides, the money been there. Don't get me wrong, I don't like the shit though. You know what, you never told me what happened to your uncle. This crazy motherfucker got stabbed up by a chick he was cheating on. And then my auntie joined the church. That's when I took over. Hmm, your fucking friends ate everything and I am starving. Your greedy ass. (Mumbles) Nope, no, we not doing this, I'm hungry.

This nigga. What now? Hold on. Really? Hey Man, where you all at? All right, I'm on my way around there, Man, they got Dub, Man. All right, you get around there, Man, I'm on my way right now. All right. Wait, where you going? I'm about to go get my man's out of jail, if you don't mind. Now, I know that's your man or whatever, and I'm not saying ain't nobody gotta get him, but god damn, why it gotta be you? Because if he go down, we all go down. Exactly, if he go down, ya'll all go down. I gotta go find me some.. So, instead of trying to save him, how about you try to save yourself? How about you try to save us, damn? Man, I don't know where the fuck Rob at. Your guess is as good as mines. Hey, but if they raid the spot, Man, they shouldn't find shit. Ain't shit been up in that motherfucker for a minute. But I can tell you what though, if they looking for all of us, we need to lay low for a minute, real talk. You right, you right. Rob probably got the fuck on, Man. He's smart enough to know. But you know what this mean, don't you? This nigga Mitchell turned on us, Bro. What we gonna do? Bet. So, where is he? He in there. They won't let nobody see him, only his lawyer. What, he got a lawyer? Yeah, some bougie bitch he probably fucking. She said she gonna come out here and talk to us. Now, what is he doing here? Look, you can go ahead and go on back where you was going, okay, you done all ready got what you wanted from her. This is family business, all right? Anything I can do to help? (Mumbles) at the courthouse. No, it's cool, we gotta wait for his attorney. Hey look, you gonna freeze in that jacket. Here, take mine, just put this over yours, okay? Thank you. Look, I'm sorry about all of this. No problem, don't even worry about it. Take care of your family. I'll give you a call tomorrow. Come get my jacket, it'll give me a reason to come see you. Okay. All right, take care. Charlotte? I'm Tamara Woodward, your brother's attorney. I didn't know he had an attorney. Nevertheless, he's being taken to county in the morning and arraigned on Monday. You can see him before arraignment, but I'm gonna need to talk to you tomorrow, say at the River Front at 2:00 pm? I guess. I'm just taking my client's orders. Hey, do you run? No. You should, you gotta keep a hot body hot. It's cool, I can walk a lot. You can walk, right? I guess. So, why you got me here? So, he's never mentioned me, huh? No, not at all. Your brother's a smart man, he keeps everything private. But I've heard about you, his smart little sister that he's determined is gonna be an attorney one day. Do you know why? So I can protect him. The same way he's always protected me. Would you do anything to protect him, Charlotte? Of course I would. Even if it meant taking over his business? Me? My brother wouldn't dare have that. He don't even want me hanging around. He is way too over protective. You sure it was you he was protecting? He says you have gifts. He says you have the heart to do what needs to be done. Look, they said that he was in a vehicle receiving fellatio from some girl. He says that he was driving some ho home from the casino. You think he would admit to that. I mean, at worse, it's just a fine. So why are they keeping him? Because apparently there's a warrant out that he didn't know about and that I didn't know about. Something's off. Meanwhile, the prosecutor's out here trying to make Detroit safe for the rich to come back. And drug dealers are a problem for her. So, what are you saying? He's looking at about a year alone on the warrant, maybe longer. Someone has to step up. Well, he definitely want it to be Rob, maybe even Turk, they the ones been with him the longest. He wants you. He doesn't know who he can trust right now. That don't make sense. He's always been there for you. He's paid for your car, your clothes, he's sent you to school. You've never had to work a day in your life. You have to. Look, I don't know how to sell drugs. It's easy. All you gotta do is buy it for one price and sell it for another. You pay your people and then you keep the change. You're smart, you'll get the hang of it. You have about 15 minutes tomorrow before court to talk to him, and be there by 8:30. And have your answer ready. And don't tell your aunt, he doesn't want her involved. I'll talk to you tomorrow. So? You were right, they are definitely fucking. Look, don't be using that vulgar language with me, okay, I'm a good Christian woman. Show me some respect, god damn it. Oh my god, are you okay? Hey, hey, I'm good. Where's Auntie? The pastor had to come over and pray with her. She not doing good, she can't take all of this stuff. Okay, look Charlotte, there's something I need to talk to you about. Okay, talk. Listen, that night, things just didn't tranquil out the way it's supposed to. Nigga, what the fuck is you doing, I pay you! I found a way to get more. If you want my money, this ain't how you gonna get it! This is exactly how you get it. Hey, Man, fuck you! Whoa, whoa, can't do this right now. You lucky my partner got a fucking heart. Hey Man, fuck you! Hey Man, shut the fuck up! Cuff this motherfucker and put some charges on him. Okay, so what about the girl you was with? What happened to her, she saw everything, where's she at? Look, when they pulled me over, they cut her loose. She got the fuck home. We think their plan was to kill him. When that didn't work out, they decided to lock him up for a while. I just got news from the prosecutor and there's a lot of new charges. New charges? Charges, what charges? Possession of a weapon. A weapon? And marijuana. Dub, who is behind this? I don't know. You do know, think about it! Charlotte, I do not know. Could it be another gang? It could be an inside job? Look, all I do know, somebody got to Mitchell and it may very well be one of my boys. But right now, I'm not trusting nobody. Ya'll all I got. Crackhead broke in one night, shot my brother and his wife. I was in the back asleep. The gunshots is what woke me up. When I ran in the room, I saw that the man had his gun right in front of Charlotte's face. So, I went over to him and knocked his gun down but he knocked me down and left me there unconscious. When I woke up, the man was dead and William was holding the gun. An eight year old boy killed a man to protect us. You've been through so much with them kids all ready, but you must continue to endure, Sister, you must. Look, we've been here before. Somebody thinking we weak, they coming for us. We did what we had to do. Right, and we'll do it again, because I got you. I love you, all right. I love you, too. Look, I need you all to find out who got to Mitchell. Find out who tried to set me up, okay? Okay. All right. Time's up. I was young and didn't know how to provide for them. I was messing around with this dude and he gave me money and taught William how to hustle. Never stood a chance, did he? Is it my fault that he's like this? No, it's not, it's not. Let's pray, Sister. So, I have my work to do and you have yours. So, what's your strategy? I'm gonna try to get us any transcript as possible. In the meantime, I'd like to speak to whoever this Lecia is. She might have something to say that can help us. Nah, that's just another hoodrat. It's worth a shot. I'll be in touch. Get in. What? Man, get in the truck! Lil sis, what up though? Please call me Charlie. So what, nobody wanted to come in? Shit, how you know they don't want us too? Well, you all just pulled up in front of a court house, so apparently you ain't too worried about that. Shit, I figured if they had the (mumbles), they'd be hitting doors by now. Then we see you walking out with the white bitch, so we must be good, right? So what, you Niggas following me? Nah, we just wanna know what's going on. Me, too. So, what the fuck happened, Man? Who is this? It's Ali, she with the crew, she cool. What up, Ma? Weed, weapon, public indecency. Apparently this nigga had his fucking dick out when he got arrested. Oh, and a warrant that he didn't know about, his lawyer didn't know about. They got this nigga locked up. It's gonna be a good six months before he even gets a court date. So, why the fuck didn't he call us? One phone call, gave that to the lawyer. Where the fuck is Rob ass at? Shit, ain't nobody seen that nigga since Dub got locked up. We've been all laying low at the spots, for real. But he all right. Look, we gotta talk. I'm gonna be at the spot tomorrow, please make sure Rob's ass is there. I'll text you and let you know the time. Yo Dog, who is that? That's Dub's sister. Oh, for real? She's straight though, ain't she? Yeah. What's up, what took you so long? Oh, what is this? Just wait for it. Hello? Hey. Hey. Okay, so what do you need me to do? Okay, look, the house is just a meet up spot. We ain't doing no slanging out of there. Turk, and Rob, and Junk, they all got they location for that. Speaking of which, never go get no bags. Let them bring everything to you. Matter of fact, today is pay day so I need you to get over to the house and collect. They all gonna bring you about 80,000. A piece? Yeah, a piece. Look, it shouldn't be no problem but you never know. Just keep your eyes open, all right. You remember where I keep my shit at? Yeah, I know. What am I supposed to do with all this money? Look, take a little bit out for Auntie, for the house. Write this address down real quick. 456 Washington Ave, Tamara gonna meet you over there, all right. Just throw her a little something from my legals and shit. Put the rest of it up, you hear me? Yeah. All right. Look, we gotta re-up with Matteo in a couple days too. Don't go see this crazy motherfucker by yourself. Take Turk and Junk with you. Count time. Look, I gotta do count time. Let me get up outta here. Dub, Dub! Shit. Four catch dice. What up, Sis?

I'm glad you niggas came. Look, that shit might work for you on a Friday or Saturday night, but you ain't that fucking fine. Somebody set my brother up. Mitchell tried to kill him. And until we figure it out, I'm running this shit. So what, he sent you here to babysit us? As long as the money keep coming, Nigga, I don't give a fuck what ya'll do.

And we here with our bags. I mean, did ya'll talk to his wife? Something, ya'll don't know nothing! Look, Ali, she with him all the time, she might know where he at. Nah, see I don't know her so I don't trust her. Matter of fact, one of ya'll need to be sticking with her. Let me get this straight, first you march your ass in this motherfucker talking about you the boss. Then you come in here accusing of shit, and now you need our help. Get the fuck outta here.

Let me show you where the safe is. Dub says to take care of you. I expect him to get the best defense. He will. So, what does he do with all this money? He takes care of you and your aunt. What else? He spends a lot of money maintaining his enterprises. Enterprises? In addition to his many houses, he has a warehouse and a few businesses. He has to claim the money but that's my problem, not yours. And this is a little light. How much we gotta give Matteo? A lot. Well, this is for our support and my shopping. So, I guess I'll be back later. Charlotte. Take the keys. Would you like me to start you a room? Sure, thank you. Not a problem. Hello? Hey, what you doing? Nothing. Wrong answer, there's always something to do. Look, I collected, I've been to your fly ass loft, and now I'm shopping, damn. Okay, look don't go over board, all right.

Hey, how much did you get? Well, Rob wasn't there, so. What? Yeah, Turk can't even get him on the phone either. Look, I hate to say this but you know Uncle Raymond, he had that boy together.

I ain't buy as many houses as you. I'm just gonna make sure that account's settled, Man. You know what I'm saying, because I damn sure don't want nobody coming after me later. Man, ain't nobody coming after you. Nobody wanna come after you. All right, cool, just get that money, just get it to Charlotte, all right? Charlotte? She in charge now. Wait a minute, did you just say Charlotte? Brother, she can handle it. You must wanna die. THat's what it is, I think you wanna die, Man. I'm gonna help you. Gonna help? That's gotta be the dumbest shit you ever said, Man. You know what, what you gonna do? What I'm gonna do? Shit, I don't know, probably go to New York, rap. Probably take my ass to Georgia, buy a farm. Hell, I might even go to Vegas and lose it all. Shit, I don't know. You did this to me, didn't you? Huh? You mad because Raymond gave it to me to run and not you? Did I do this to you, really? Yeah. I would never betray you, you're my fucking brother. Then who, Rob? Man, I don't know, Man. That's the shit that's tripping me out, Man. See, this ain't no crew shit because I can handle that. I'm just saying, Man. If I get caught up, Man, that's three for me, that's life. And if I die, who the fuck gonna take care of my kids, Man? I know you understand where I'm coming from. You don't want that for them. And neither do I. Yeah, he ain't against me. I mean, he didn't run off with that money, you just need to find him. Well, Junk and Ali looking for him now. Question is am I gonna be able to go see Matteo without his half? Yeah. Look, but it ain't about the money, yo. Hey, something else I was thinking, though, what if it's Mitchell? Mitchell? Man, look, the sooner we find him, the sooner we will know. And what's up with this Ali chick? Man, I just need her to run the work until I get out. But watch her, okay. Don't send that bitch to do shit that you can do. Okay. Your room is waiting for you. Okay, thank you. No problem. Charlie! Charlie! He's dead? Yeah, they both outta here. But look, you can't sit right here though. I just got over here. What the fuck you come for in the first place? Look, Dub asked me to talk to Rob. So, that nigga just don't trust us to do shit no more, huh? It's not even like that. Rob was like a brother to us. Let's get the fuck up outta here before somebody see us. This bitch gonna get us killed. She dumb as fuck, yo. What if it's not somebody small, though? What if it's the cop or Lecia? What if it's the fucking Mexicans? What if it's somebody closer? Calm down, this is the game, people die. Dub said you can handle it. I can handle it. I watched both of my parents get killed right in front of my face, that don't mean I gotta like it. Talking about Rob, that's like my fucking brother. They have $80,000. Small time can't keep that much a secret. We got the meet coming up. You need to be on your game. What? Let's get your mind off of work for a while. Who was the guy with you at the police station? Demar, he's just somebody from my class. He likes you. I know, I mean, I like him too but it's just not time for all of that right now. Right now you need to relax. Invite him over. Here? Yeah, tell him it's my place. I'm leaving. I have to go see your brother anyway. Well, give him my love. Hey. Hey. How you doing? I'm good. I started to think all you wanted to do was hit it and quit it. Nah, I like you, there's just a lot going on with my brother, him getting arrested and everything. Yeah, well, tell me all about it. You know I work at the courthouse, I got a lot of police officer friends. I'll do anything I can to help you and your brother out. You got a lot of police officer friends, huh? Well, we think my brother got set up by a dirty cop. So, how can you help with that? Well, how about this? Mmm, nah, that didn't help. All right, what about this then? No, still didn't help. Come here. Oh, all right. I'm his attorney, you can leave us. Hey, Baby. I have some bad news. What's up? It's Rob. What's wrong with Rob? He's dead. Fuck! I knew it! Damn! All of his money is missing. It's that dirty ass Mitchell, Man. He couldn't get to me so he had to get to Rob. What about Matteo? Are you gonna send Charlie in without all of the money? Nah, nah, nah, Matteo's good people but, shit, man, we can't just not go. So, what do you want me to tell her? Just pay for Rob's funeral. Fuck. Dang. Yes, Tamara. I know, Dub left me very specific instructions. I can't re-up with Matteo because I don't have all the money but I still gotta go explain everything, I know. I got this. Matteo, shit is getting old out here in these streets. It's time to be out with the old and in with the new. I'm not having a job fair. No new faces, no new problems. Anything else I can do for you, gentlemen? Okay, we'll be talking again. Have a nice day, Officers. Dude, you all right? What? Man, you fucking with the money. Dude, I got this shit. Let's go. I hope so, you fucking with my pockets. I'm not sure that I wanna do this. It's a weird, sadistic, OCD motherfucker. Look, this is what Dub wanted but I do appreciate ya'll coming with me. Come on, Sis, you know we wouldn't leave you hanging. (Spanish) Working on my Spanish. And you must be Senorita Charlotte. Buenos dias, Matteo. We need to talk. Talk? Okay. Let's go to my office. I'm sorry about your brother. I'm sorry about Roberto. You don't have the money. And I don't have any information for you. The streets really do talk, huh? They do. I can give you a few days to get all this straightened out but after that, we both know the scavengers will be coming for your territory. You have a war on your hands. Oh, we won't have a war, I assure you of that. Look, my brother sends his apologies for the inconvenience, but we gonna be right back on schedule in no time. Your brother told me a long time ago that if you ever walked in here, bad things were about to happen. And here you are. You understand my reservation about getting involved. I will definitely be getting to the bottom of all of this. You do that. I'll give you a week. Just one week. And then what? This is a business. People wanna buy. We sell it to them. Gracias, Matteo. Until next week. Charlie. If this was big, I would know. Clean your house, mamasita. Well, why would Matteo wanna hurt his best customer? He ain't got nothing to gain from that. Unless, he wants what's ours. Dub said he was trying to expand to the north and the west side. Maybe Matteo wants everything. Dub did say whoever got to Mitchell had more money. Matteo does have more money. What's good, family? What's good, my guy? We're ready, you all right? You tell me, Man. It's fucked up out here right now, Man, niggas ain't eating, niggas on my head about the shit, you know? Niggas ain't eating, it's my fault out here right now. Tell you what, just keep the motherfucking bags open, the store be open in one minute. ♪ It's money on the table ♪ ♪ These labels, they can't afford me ♪ ♪ I'm a different type of nigga ♪ ♪ Gazelle, cover my legs ♪ ♪ Always keep it real, My Nigga, you just pretend ♪ ♪ I'm an unfamiliar nigga ♪ Nick, Nicky! (Mumbles) What the fuck, take him to the back. Now who else knew exactly where the fuck to find us at? Who? I don't know, Charlotte. But please, don't do anything. We're not here. Dub isn't gonna want you to retaliate against Matteo. You can't do that. Charlotte, are you there? Charlotte, are you there? Look, don't call me Charlotte, it's Charlie! Your boy in there knocked the fuck out. Good. Sis, we gotta fucking do something, Man. Look, that (mumbles) put down. Nah, see, something just don't feel right. A motherfucker just tried to blow your motherfucking head off. That shit ain't supposed to seem right. We can't be riding out in that whip either. You know all them hos, make sure you leave that shit here. The (mumbles) put down. Dog and them is on the way. What am I supposed to tell them? Tell them motherfuckers I said wait, Nigga, is you deaf? Matter of fact, have them niggas get rid of the whip. The fuck. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Well, why would Matteo wanna hurt his best customer? He got nothing to gain from that. Right now I'm (mumbles), you're all I got. Someone has to step up. If this was big, I would know. Clean your house, mamasita. A motherfucker just tried to blow your motherfucking head off! She's going to get us killed if she runs after Matteo. Do you think he cares that she's your sister? And do we even know that it's him? She's with Turk at Her Place salon. I'm scared for her, William. But what if she tries to go off and do something? I think somebody's here. What's going on, where's Charlotte at? Call me back. Where have you been? I've been busy. Uh uh, get back over here. Oh my god, are you hurt? No, look, Turk got shot. So, you messing around with them now? Not exactly. Then what exactly? The night Dub got arrested, somebody was actually trying to kill him, okay. Now Rob is dead and they trying to kill us too. Charlotte, what the hell have you gotten yourself into? Dub asked me to take over until he gets home. No, no, I'm not losing you too. You are gonna stay in school, you are not like William, you can't do it! I'm all ready doing it! Look, that's my brother, I'm gonna do whatever I gotta do to protect him. Charlotte, listen to me, I was young when I took ya'll in, I didn't know what I was doing. It's my fault anyway. Look, okay, it's my fault. Raymond should have never taken Dub under his wing, but not you, Charlotte. You are gonna stay in school, you are going to be a lawyer, you cannot be a part of his shit! We are all ready apart of his shit! You haven't paid a bill in 15 years. What you thought, that (mumbles) been taking care of us? Charlotte! Look, here's your money, okay. I just came to get something out of the basement for when Dub gets his shit. Oh, Lord, help me! Ms. Palmer, can I speak to you, please? You know, it's very possible that both children may experience violence outbreaks because of what they've been through. Even William, you know what he did, it's understandable that that could.. That he could go crazy? Without counseling, yes, his mental health could decline. You know, the principle, she is very, very concerned. She's all ready contacted me. She's concerned about both of them. So, are you saying that he could be a killer? I mean, Charlotte, she's just seen too much. You know, the state could offer.. No, you're not taking these kids away from me! Come on, ya'll, let's go! Come on, let's go! Ms. Palmer, we're gonna have to discuss this. Oh, shit. What happened? Relax, my dog. Only thing you need to be worried about is you being straight, My Nigga. Where's Charlie? Couldn't even tell you, My Nigga. She decided to move a minute ago. She what? Yeah. She gonna get her forehead blowed off. Bro, I feel you on that shit, Bbro. But what the fuck is we gonna do about Matteo? They came for us, Bro, and that shit clear as day. First we gotta find Charlie. Hand me my shit. Then we worry about Matteo. Dog, that shit got to be fucking Matteo, Man. What makes you so sure? Yo, who else is it gonna be? Your motherfuckers forgot about Mitchell? Ya'll stop looking for him all ready? Nah, Man, but.. But what? Ya'll let Charlie leave, can't find Mitchell. What the fuck do I need you two motherfuckers for? Ah, shit. You good? It look like you playing paintball. Yeah, Kevin Hart, yeah, I'm good. Hey, listen up. Spread the word, tell rats for whoever finds Mitchell. You hear me? Don't nobody touch him, nobody. You call me first, all right? All right, don't forget to put the word out. Get rid of that car. I'm on it. Man, I gotta go find this fucking goddamn gangsta thot. Man, that bitch had that coming anyway. You right, but if we wrong, and it ain't Matteo and them, they up on our head and I'm not about to fuck this shit up for no bitch, no bitch! Charlotte! What is he doing here? He wouldn't leave. Tell me what's going on. Nothing, Demar. Really, you come in with blood all over you and you seem different ever since your brother got locked up. And I just don't know, Man. It's like you're involved with his business somehow and you gonna get yourself killed. If I don't help my brother, he's gonna get killed. Why don't you let me help you? You know I know a lot of people. Demar, look, why don't you just go home. Forget everything it is that you think you know. Go be a lawyer. Look, I care a lot about you. But man, I'll go. But I ain't gonna stop trying to help you out. I'll be back. Who is this? Oh, I'm family. I'll be in the back. Just go, Demar. Ain't that right, Charlie? That supposed to be your new boyfriend? How do you know about this place? I was with Dub when he bought this motherfucker. We used to fuck so many bitches in here. That's before he fucked around and started playing house and shit. What do you want? Whoa. Turk good. I thought you might care. Of course I care, you know that. He was worried about you too. Thought you might be doing some stupid shit, like trying to kill Matteo and them. Like I said before, I'm not even sure Matteo is the person behind this. He on that same tip, and put a $10,000 bond in Mitchell head for whoever finds him first. Good. I wanna know as soon as ya'll hear something about it. Let me ask you a question. You really think that was Mitchell that came for us tonight? I don't know. Man, what the fuck is up with you? What? What? All this, when you show up, bad shit gonna happen. Look, I don't know what Matteo was talking about. Listen here, Little Lady, my family on the shit farm and I pull the wagon. So, you can't pull no shit on me. You know good and god damn well what the fuck I'm talking about. Nigga, I'm good over here, just like you. Mmm mmm, the difference is it's not my first rodeo. Well, it ain't mine either. Well, I guess I should get the fuck up outta here. Good. Unless... You want a nigga to stay. I sure don't. You sure? Positive. So, you mean to tell me I'm the only one that's been feeling this little vibe between us? Come on now, we both were. You can admit it. Look, that was before I found out that you were a fucking slut. Listen here, hos tell me yes, but the bitches don't tell me no. Well, Charlie ain't no bitch. Check this out, if anybody I care about get hurt, I'm coming for you. Likewise. This is why dogs stay out of the house. We got an understanding, right? Good evening, Ladies. Yup, I'll see you in the morning, we got us a cop to find, right? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. (Mumbles) your nephew. Something wrong with that boy, I'm trying to tell you. He ain't got no momma or no daddy, so what you mean what's wrong with him? I mean, what you expect for him to do? Well, you gonna have to do something. That's why I'm sitting here trying to talk to you about it. I mean, I know I don't want them to go to the state. Fuck it, I'll take him, teach him something useful. Give him some game about himself. Plus, I got my nephew Rob anyway. Hell, one more ain't gonna make no difference. What about Charlotte, I mean, there's two of them. What? What about her? I'm just saying, there's two of them, what am I supposed to do with Charlotte? I don't know but what I do know is she not built for these streets. Look, Ray, I don't know what else to do. Like I said, didn't nobody else want them. I just said okay because that's my brother. I mean, I didn't know this was gonna happen. You know what, don't even worry about it because Charlotte, she ain't even... Dig, she gonna be all right, okay? Bring him in. Not Charlotte. Look, she's been my backup plan for a long time, Auntie. There's a lot on the floor right now. What! Why her? She's not like you, she's not evil! You think I'm evil? Look, it's not your fault. You shouldn't... You shouldn't had to do that. But we all knew you was gonna go crazy if Raymond didn't teach you! But not Charlotte. She was okay, she was all right! She's going to be a lawyer and leave all of this behind her! We owe that to her! We! Me and you! What happened that night? You know what happened? Do you? What? You think I'm so evil. Auntie, you was knocked out. And when I woke up, you had the gun. But it wasn't me that pulled the trigger. No! Yeah, the one you think is, oh, so normal. I always seen that, you never did. You only seen what you wanted to see. I'm concerned about one more child, you know, the Palmer children? Well, I spoke with the district psychologist, and he thinks the girl needs immediate psychotherapy. Okay, as soon as the aunt gets here, please let me know and I'll speak with her. Okay. All those (mumbles). But Charlotte, she the killer. And right now, somebody's after me, Auntie, and if they can't get to me, they gonna get to you. Look, we need her! So, this whole time I thought you was protecting Charlotte from your life! But you was saving her for a rainy day! Auntie, would you just hold your grip! If it wasn't for you, Raymond still be here running the crew! Rainy days, huh? I guess we all gotta sharpen an umbrella someday. Hello, Officer Peters? Yeah, this is Demar over at the courthouse. Hey, I need a big favor. Yup, I told you I'd call and cash in on it. Yeah, but it's something simple though. I need you to run a license plate for me. It's Bravo, Delta, Tango, 9414. Mmm, it should be... Yeah, it should be registered to Reshard Willar. All right, how long would that be? Yeah, I need it as soon as you can get it to me. About an hour? Okay. Yup, an hour works, thanks a lot. All right, bye. Well, look who it is, Tony Montana. Man, you's a fucking idiot, Dog. Where is everybody at? Getting money, where they supposed to be. Turk, he good, what's up? Yeah, he in the kitchen. Oh, he here? Okay. Word. You sure it was good? Hell yeah, well, check it out. Okay, handle that. You know I'll take care of it, 100, all right. So, what's good, Turk, ya'll got this nigga or what? Hell yeah they got him. At his favorite hangout, you ain't gonna ever guess where. Where? Dearborn. Ooh, got em! So, this nigga just out and about, fuck it. He ain't got a clue we on that ass. Ain't nobody more feelings than a dirty cop who feels like his boys in blue gonna protect him, real shit. Hey, but one thing this shit gotta be, it gotta be perfect, we can't have no mistakes. How we gonna do it? Hmm, shit, we can't, he know all us. We step one step across Warren Ave, he on our head, everybody dead. Yeah. That nigga don't know me. Crazy this bitch, (mumbles) My Nigga. What you gonna do, pull that Glock on him? Nah, like you said, shit gotta be perfect. I'm gonna think of something. What I wanna know right now is where the fuck is my breakfast at? Can I eat? See, see? What? Okay. Got you together. What's up, Fat Boy? I'm gonna need to get that bread up out your boy. Last time you didn't show. That can't happen again. But if it does, I swear, I will close this raggedy motherfucker down. Really, Officer Mitch? I got that little couple dollars for you. This gonna be your last time coming around here though, harassing me. Know what I'm saying, step off a Michigan ass. I'm gonna send ya'll to your table and you have a good night, Officer. Damn, Baby Girl, are you new? Oh no, I was just looking for the bathroom, my bad. Really, bathroom and locker room?

All right, well you're gonna have to stay close because I drive fast. Okay. Not now, Sis, got a job to do. So, when I looked at Reshard's known associates, we had a William Palmer, Dub, John Turk, and Robert Martin, which I think they found him dead off Plymouth this week. I all ready know this. Yeah, but did you know Reshard was arrested last year for possession with an Alicia Mitchell, alias Alicia Williams. Mitchell, who is she? See, I thought it was interesting when Dub's arresting officer name was Mitchell also, so I did some checking. He has a daughter named Alicia Mitchell. So, you think that Licia is Mitchell's daughter? That would explain how she got away when they got arrested. Right. Yeah, I just sent you the address. Look, hurry up! So, here's a copy of her drivers license. Does it look familiar? No, but I've never seen her. Well, let's try this. This is her mugshot after being arrested last year. How about now? She changed her look. See, I saw her sitting in the car when I was leaving last night, Reshard's car. So, if she was with him, then that means he's the inside man. So, I'm gonna ask you one more time and I need you to be truthful with me. Where is Charlotte at? I swear, I don't know. But we need to find her before he does something. What did you say your name was again? Charlie. That's right. That's a sexy name. You, uh, you have some liquor, some wine or something? Sure I do. You can have anything you want. I'll be right back. Hey, don't go no where. Hey, Man, look at you. You like what you see? Yeah, most definitely. Get your motherfucking hands off my woman. You wanna fuck her? What's happening (mumbles)? You don't look so happy to see us. Tie this nigga up, Man. On some real shit, Charlie, we gotta talk about that motherfucker body you throwing around this motherfucker. Quit acting like I ain't got my motherfucking dick on me. Now, you need to hold on, Nigga, that's my little sister, Nigga. Would you focus! I'm looking for the money! Now we got your punk ass. What the fuck? Look what I found. What the fuck? Wait until you see the rest of it. Just look, it have everybody, you, Rob. This nigga been plotting us the whole motherfucking time. Look at this shit. What the fuck. We gotta get rid of it. All of it. All this shit. Motherfucker, you know what you did, you killed Rob. Now, you can tell us where you put that play down or we gonna do you right here, bitch. Well, you might as well kill me because I'm not talking. Of course we gonna kill you. You killed Rob, you tried to kill my brother. Nigga, it's over for your ass. Your brother? I'm not talking. My death ain't gonna be easy to cover up. My boys will come looking for you. Yeah, well I all ready thought of that. See, we done cleared out that weak ass obsession board you had. Wiped out the computer, I got the money. Only thing they gonna find is them three phones you got. Oh, and this one, along with these panties from one of the strippers at the club. What phone is that? Just the one I used to talk to my brother in prison. My fingerprints are all ready off of it. Once they trace it back to him, you can't help but look like a dirty cop. Which you are, motherfucker! That has sex with strippers and got robbed by one. You old as fuck, you drunk as fuck. Looks like you just got in over your head to me. You sure you wanna have all this fun by yourself? I'm never talking! Your brother got greedy! He wanted to expand and make bigger players with the Mexicans and didn't wanna cut me in! Nigga, we pay you good money for good protection! There is no you without me. You throw me a few dollars while you all rack up millions. Nigga, fuck ya'll! It's over, it's done! There's somebody new taking over. Give me the fucking gun. So, that's how you feel, Nigga? Fine. (Mumbles) Clean that shit up for me? Got you. Yo, who that? It's me? Me who? It's Ali, open up! Fuck, Nigga. Where you all been? We had some shit to take care of. Where the fuck you been at? We hit you up earlier. Shit, I've been at the spot getting that money. What was up? Don't worry about it, you just keep getting that money. Hello? Charlotte, where have you been? We've been looking for you all night! I know, I know. We had work. What did you do? Yeah, we found Mitchell. So, ya'll found Mitchell? Yeah, the money too. What happened? Let's just say he will not be able to testify. He had surveillance on all of us, the whole crew, even Auntie. Where is Junk? He good, he knocked out, why? Demar found out that Mitchell has a daughter named Alicia, as in Licia, and she's been arrested before with Junk. The three of them must have been working together this entire time. What? Come on, Man, he good, we all good. Demar said he saw Alicia in the car with Junk last night. I'm looking at her license right now. This is the girl Dub described. Demar? Come on, that don't even make sense. If Junk was with anybody, it would've had to have been Ali. Ali? Alicia. Is Ali a little butch? Yeah. What happened? What the fuck you think happened? We smoked that bitch ass nigga. Charlotte, it's the same person! Bitch, the fuck you doing, Ali? I kill him. Mitchell was her father. What? What do you, what the fuck you mean? This Licia. Licia gone, we all saw Licia. She was.. A girl, a real fucking girl, huh! Not like me, a dyke bitch, huh? Bitch, you killed my father! And I'm gonna kill your ass, too. Bitch, we'll see. Charlie, what the fuck, man you gonna have 5-0 all over this motherfucker!

I failed. I didn't protect my family. She gonna kill my aunt and Demar. They ain't never hurt nobody. Because she think I'm gonna bring it to her. Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself. Hello? Dub's warehouse. If you wanna see your people again, I suggest you bring it all. What? Where the fuck is Turk's ass at? Hello, where is you at? I'm not giving her no fucking money. Nigga, I will kill the both of them myself before I give her ass a dime. Just meet me at the fucking warehouse, Dog. Damn! Gotta do everything myself. Yeah? Yeah, we here, pull in. My father always said, Alicia, you want the power, you need to go take it! They wasn't gonna give it to me, so I took my shot! Well, you fucked with the wrong crew! Did I? Your brother was so stuck on getting his dick sucked, he never even looked at my face! And your so called brother, Rob, he got me in the room, showed me the operation, then let me in his crib to get murdered! You wanna tell me I picked the wrong crew. I beg to differ. Rest in peace, Junkyard. That nigga was sleeping on you! Niggas think a bitch ain't good for nothing but laying on her back! So, I had to show them. We could've been a team but you bullshitting. You shouldn't have fucked with my brother. You shouldn't have fucked with my auntie. You definitely shouldn't have fucked with me. Don't try to stop me, Auntie.

Good shit, we gotta throw him a party. Charlie? Charlie? It's a good thing. Yeah, for him. For everybody. I know what'll make you feel better, crab house, crab legs, surf n turf, yup! So, I'm really happy with what you and Demar did with the community. Oh, thank you. Compliment from Auntie. Hey, Lil Sister. You gonna let me in? Yeah, come in, welcome home. Oh, my baby's home! Hey, Auntie. Hey! How are you? Good. Good to see you. You, too. Man. So, you good, you need something to drink? Oh, I'm gonna take this really quick. I mean, I ain't heard from you in months. You stopped coming to visit me and everything. What do you expect, Dub? We got a lot to do, I've been busy. We had to rebuild everything that we lost. Keep the work moving in the streets, maintain the relationships, all while not trying to look weak to these other niggas. I mean, yeah, that would be a lot. Yeah, plus we've been doing a lot of charity work as well, you know school supplies, sports equipment, anything to keep the kids off the streets, right? Right. We need some goodwill around here. Goodwill, huh? Yeah. I guess the education paying off. Actually, it wasn't my idea. It was mine. Believe in giving back. Bet you got some big plans ahead. Demar? Yeah. Hey, I owe you a lot, Man. Oh, Charlotte's health and happiness is all I want. You know Turk is planning on throwing you a party this weekend. Oh, really? So, I guess you got everything in order. I mean, do you still got a place for me and my business? Not if it means things have to go back to the way they were. You know I'm a different girl now? Nothing like the one you left. Of course you are, Charlie. Man, look, I'm gonna always need you by my side. I know there's nothing you wouldn't do for your big brother. Nothing. I protect you and you protect me. Nobody coming for us again. Nobody's coming for us. I'm here now, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. I need you to do something for me. I'm not moving back in with Auntie. No, look, I'm gonna get you an apartment off the water, somewhere nice. You and Demar be happy. You will? Yeah. I just need everything to get back to the way it used to be. You in school, me running the crew. I'm allowed to protect you, Dub. Look, the best protection you give me is being my lawyer. It shouldn't have to be Tamara. It should be you by my side. That way if I need you to hurt somebody, all I have to do is call you. Auntie, you gotta know I'm always in control. You think I unleashed a bitch I couldn't handle. Shoot him. Charlie. Oh, Demar, did you meet my brother, he's home? It's gonna be okay, Charlotte, I'll protect you. ♪ I'm a natural born hustler ♪ ♪ I'll be getting money since youngster ♪ ♪ So much over the top with it ♪ ♪ I was on the under ♪ ♪ Running through the (mumbles) ♪ ♪ Hit the mall, cashout ♪ ♪ Running through the crowds, running through the hos ♪ ♪ Here we on the couch, then the nigga stay froze ♪ ♪ I ain't asked to be fly ♪ ♪ But blame the game that I chose ♪ ♪ Addicted to the fast lane (mumbles) ♪ ♪ Hustle to the morning, never stop until the cash came ♪ ♪ My conscious, telling me nigga, you oughtta chill ♪ ♪ But I'm caught in (mumbles) and loving the way it feels ♪ ♪ Fine dining, Nigga, but I'm paying for my meal ♪ ♪ It's probably but you paying on your bills ♪ ♪ But on the flip side, I still gotta watch my circle ♪ ♪ Be the niggas closest to you who ♪ ♪ Be plotting to murk you ♪ ♪ They swear to god the money done made you change ♪ ♪ But it's not you, it's them who don't remain the same ♪ ♪ You feel me? ♪ ♪ I was taught to make the money, ♪ ♪ Don't let it make me ♪ ♪ I was taught to take the streets before they take me ♪ ♪ Now I got it all and I wish for (mumbles) ♪ ♪ I can't understand, why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The life I've been living is so addictive ♪ ♪ All the fast cars and all the women ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The life I've been living is so addicting, ♪ ♪ So addicting ♪ ♪ My mama raised me as a king ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ After living the fast lifestyle ♪ ♪ It's like a high that never goes away ♪ ♪ Now you hooked and hope to never have a slower day ♪ ♪ Ain't no feeling like waking up in the morning, ♪ ♪ Bad broad next to you while you yawning ♪ ♪ The moment you looking out of the window like, ♪ ♪ Damn, this what my life is ♪ ♪ Buying nice shit, like fuck what the price is ♪ ♪ Reminiscing on my days I was struggling, ♪ ♪ Stuck, couldn't figure it out ♪ ♪ Wishing I was (mumbles) ♪ ♪ All of these niggas I hang around with ♪ ♪ Broke with no ambition, living on some clown shit ♪ ♪ I was searching for my niche and I found it ♪ ♪ Now I'm fly, like I don't know what the ground is ♪ ♪ But I still gotta watch my circle ♪ ♪ Be the niggas closest to you always ♪ ♪ Trying to murk you ♪ ♪ They swear to god the money done made you change ♪ ♪ But it's not you, it's them who don't remain the same ♪ ♪ You feel me? ♪ ♪ I was taught to make the money, ♪ ♪ Don't let it make me ♪ ♪ I was taught to take the streets before they take me ♪ ♪ Now I got it all and I wish for (mumbles) ♪ ♪ I can't understand ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The life I've been live is so addicting ♪ ♪ All the fast cars and all the women ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The life I've been living is so addicting ♪ ♪ So addicting ♪ ♪ And my mama raised me as a king, ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ Restitution had to (mumbles) ♪ ♪ You can't enjoy the fruits of your labor ♪ ♪ A jealous nature make a hater find a reason to hate you ♪ ♪ Talk about when you move far away where it's safer ♪ ♪ Surrounded by rich people as your neighbors ♪ ♪ Damn, you're not living without ♪ ♪ Having to downgrade my life ♪ ♪ Because I've been grinding for years ♪ ♪ And I've done paid the price ♪ ♪ Fuck that, I'm gonna ball how I wanna ball ♪ ♪ Plus I only fear god, nigga ♪ ♪ I ain't sweating none of ya'll ♪ ♪ And I still gotta watch myself and stay strapped ♪ ♪ Because these niggas wanna stop my health ♪ ♪ Block my wealth ♪ ♪ I ain't paranoid, I'm cautious ♪ ♪ On some ball shit, I'm gonna get it regardless ♪ ♪ Talk to me (mumbles) ♪ ♪ I was taught to make the money ♪ ♪ Don't let it make me ♪ ♪ I was taught to take the streets ♪ ♪ Before they take me ♪ ♪ Now I got it all and I wish for (mumbles) ♪ ♪ I can't understand ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The life I've been living is so addicting ♪ ♪ All the fast cars and all the women ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ The live I've been living is so addicting ♪ ♪ So addicting ♪ ♪ And my mama raised me as a king ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪ ♪ Why does it hurt so bad? ♪
