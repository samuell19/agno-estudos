Of course, it ain't necessary to remind ya that by re-electing me sheriff, you're upholding the reputation for law and order that I've given plainville for the past 20 years. - Why ain't the fleagles in jail? - Yeah. You keep quiet, Vic Hardy. You've got no right coming in here... How come you keep on ignoring the fleagles? I got to catch 'em doing something first. Hey, quiet down there a minute, will ya? I got long distance here. I bet you he's scared of them pesky fleagles and he knows it! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll tell him, yeah, yeah. Hey, Ben! Yeah? What do you know? Bonnie fleagle just busted out of the penitentiary. Yeah, they think she's headed for their place up in potawatomi. Well, you're the sheriff, Ben, what you gonna do about it? You better get up there, Ben. Well, I ain't going alone. You are as far as I'm concerned. - I'm going home. - Hold on! Come back here. It ain't fair. If I got to go, somebody's going with me. I'm gonna deputize every able-bodied man in this store. Hold up your right hand. Swear this is the law in this here emergency according to the state statute? Ya bet you do. Now, nary a man leave here till I get back with the guns and ammunition, do you hear? And that goes for you too! Come on! Oh, howdy. Quite a bit of excitement around here. - Coming in or going out? - Oh, I'm coming in. - Was there a fire? - Hey! Leave that cider be! Them ain't paid for it yet. If he goes to potawatomi, he'll never pay for it. Now leave it be. - All right, mister, what are you selling? - Oh, I'm not selling anything. My name is Pete Marshall. I'm with the trotter poll. - What poll? - The trotter poll. Same as the gallup poll, only we're not in quite as much of a hurry. Yeah, there was a fella up here last week doing the same thing. Well, that's what I came in to ask about. - Was the fella's name smedley? - Something like that. - A short fellow with glasses? - I think maybe he was. Well, do you happen to know where he went? We haven't heard from him in a couple of weeks. Last week, said he was heading towards potawatomi. Maybe that's why you haven't heard from him. Potawatomi, eh? It wasn't like smedley to just up and quit his job without notifying us. You call that a job, meddling into other people's affairs? Oh, we're not meddling, we're simply making a survey of the modern way of life in the rural communities. Modern or not, we like it, you bet ya! Oh, naturally, naturally. All we're interested in is whether you have electric refrigerators, radios, washing machines. What do you think we are? Hicks? Uh, well, anyway, I'm up here to complete smedley's survey and locate him if I can. How far is potawatomi? About six miles up the road. - Nobody up there but the fleagles. - The fleagles, huh? Well, I'll drop by and see the fleagles. Maybe they can tell me where he is. Uh, mister... Don't the name "fleagle” mean anything to ya? No. Should it? He said, "should it?" They don't cotton to strangers up at the fleagles, especially strangers that ask questions. Oh. Well, asking questions is my business. You see, we trotter men are especially picked for our ability to probe without snooping. Thanks again, gentlemen. Think we ought to have told him? Listen, Lee, I'm still pretty spry at 80 and I got this way minding my own business. He said snooping was his business, didn't he? Of all the fleagles, it's my sons that's got to be the dumbest! I thought I told you to get rid of this club! - I thought Bert did. - I thought mert did. Do you want to get us all hung? Now take it out and bury it. Aw, ma, make Bert do it, he bashed the feller with it. Do it yourself, you held him. I don't care who bashed him or who held him! - I want it got rid of! - Oh! Now get going. Ya lazy good-for-nothings! Help! Help! Help! Help! In the house! Help! Go away, go away. Go on, get! You got here just in time. I can't hang on here much longer. Get me out, huh? Go away. Oh, thanks. Hey, wait! Wait, you're pushing me in! Yup. Yup? Help! Help! - Mert? - Help! Yeah, ma? What's all the ruckus about? Caught me a snooper. - Help! - You let him be till I get there! Aww. What you snooping around here for? A friend of mine... l assure you I wasn't snooping around. Your dogs chased me in here. I'll gladly pay for any damages. Fetch him up the house where we can get a look at him. I tell ya he's a snooper and I'm getting rid of him. Do as you're told! Get him out of there! Thanks. Hurry it up, stranger. Hey! Go on, get out, go on! Come on into the parlor. Oh, didn't see that down there. Clumsy of me. You, uh, folks in the slaughtering business? Folks in town been gossiping? Uh, no, no. I was just referring to your trophies. Pretty, ain't they? Yes, they're very smart. - Sit down, sit down. - Thank you. Now tell me what you're here for, mister. Well, Mrs. fleagle... I ain't Mrs. fleagle no more. After Clint died, I married bill Smithers. - Oh, well, Mrs. Smithers... - I ain't Mrs. Smithers neither. When bill was took, I married Mr. Johnson. Smartest critter you ever seen. Well, congratulations, Mrs. Johnson. I'm with the trotter poll. We go all over the country gathering data. You got him, ma. What are you saying? We gather data on the trend of living conditions in rural communities. Now, one of our representatives seems to have disappeared down around here and I... 1 just thought I'd inquire if you might have seen him. You may ask me your questions, young man. You may ask me practically anything. Would it surprise you to know that I have a ba, a phd, and a medical degree? No. No, not at all. I've also dabbled in phrenology, psychology, and the science of hyperphysical manifestation. Oh, then you're responsible for that lit-up dog I saw outside. That, my friend, was merely a figment of your imagination. Wish he'd stop speaking that foreign language. That's Mr. Johnson, my new husband. I told you he was a smart one. Hi, Mr. Johnson. I'm from the trotter poll. Should I make another one, mamie? - Another what? - Coffin. Coffin? Oh, grandma fleagle is a-dying. Oh, well, I wouldn't want to intrude on the family's bereavement. - We ain't bereaving. - Hold your tongue, mert! Now, uh, what was your problem? There's no problem, it was just that one of our men disappeared down here, and Dr. trotter wanted me to see if I could find him. - What was his name? - Smedley. Hector p. Smedley? Look, stranger, we don't know no smedley. Now get before I blast your ears off. Oh, that won't be necessary. - Hunting for something? - No, I was just... Oh, no, you... you couldn't have. Get. Yeah, I'm getting. Get in the house. - Yeah, but you told me... - I told you to get in the house. Wish you'd make up your mind. I could've sworn I saw you go up those stairs. No! Get out of here, you drunk! I'll get ya, I'll get ya, I'll get ya! Dirty snoop. I'll get ya, ya dirty... Ya dirty, snooping hound! Old crow never could shoot. What's the shooting for? Oh, the old gal is all het up about something, ma. Well, she won't be getting het up much longer. I thought I told you to get. Look, I'm getting a little sick of this. In, out. Out, in. Get. All right, but this is the last time. Very confusing. Why don't you just sit down there for a minute? Where do you think you're going? Ventriloquist too. No! Oh. That's the way you do it, huh? Twins. Clever, ain't they? Uh, how do you tell 'em apart? One of 'em has got a crick in his back. That's Bert. That's mert. Oh, very simple, isn't it? Bring him to, mert. Caught him snooping at the window, ma. I thought I told you to get. Well, I was just getting when he got me. - What do you think? - Mr. Johnson! Oh. Call me, mamie? Get your truck out so we can take this feller down the road. - Certainly, mamie. - Oh, it's very kind of you, but I've got my bicycle right outside and it's just a short pump to plainville. - We'll take you. - Well, that won't be necessary. I wouldn't want to put you out. - Who's down there? - Ain't nobody, grandma. You're a-lying! There's a stranger down there. I hearing him. Oh, go on, get to bed, grandma, before you catch your death. I catched it already. You know I'm a-croaking! And you're the ones that done it to me too. We are but tenants, grandma, only awaiting notice from the great landlord that our lease has expired. Lease or no lease, I know there's someone there. Is it you, Bonnie? Come up and see your old grandma. It ain't Bonnie. Bonnie will never get here in time, grandma. Why don't you tell us where it is? I won't! I'll die first. I'll die without telling the secret to nobody, so help me! Stubborn old hag. I'd like to wrap this around her neck. I'll make her talk if it's the last... Well, I guess I'll be pedaling along. Stop where you are. Mr. Johnson. Very ingenious, my sweet. Since the old woman is approaching the great beyond, don't you think it'd be nice to brighten her last moments? - Yes, it's a lovely thought. - Well, thank you. Mrs. Johnson and I wondered if you'd be good enough to go up and pretend to be the gentleman friend of her granddaughter, Bonnie. - Just pretend, mind you. - Well, I hardly know Bonnie. I mean I don't know her at all. I wouldn't know what to talk about. You'd merely listen, she'll do the talking. Well, it hardly seems fair, Mr. Johnson, to deceive the old woman. I'm awfully sorry, but I really couldn't do it. You won't need this. Stay down here, Bert, and watch things! Get out and leave me be! No need getting all het up, grandma. We got a right nice surprise for ya. - What's it now? - Bonnie's feller has come to see ya. Bonnie's feller? I knew she'd send someone if she couldn't break out. That's right. Where is he? Where is he? Right here. Come in, son. Don't you think it'd be better... Here he is, grandma. Tell me, boy, how's my little Bonnie? Uh, oh, she's very well, thank you. You got here just in time. I was sinking fast. Oh, I wouldn't say that, you look fine. Well, I ain't fine! Blow out the lamp and I'll show ya. - Blow out the lamp? - Yes. Oh, we better not do that. It might make it dark in here. Do as I say. - Leave it be. - Blow it out! Ma says, "leave it be." Blow it out, I tell you! All right, blow it out! Oh. Come here. I glow, don't I? Yes, quite a bit. I knowed it. I'm poisoned, and they're the ones that done it to me too. They did? How? What do you want to do, live forever? Get out, get out, you pack of wolves, and leave me be! We'll be waiting. - Are they gone? - Yes, they've gone. Pull up a chair. Get closer, come on. They thought they was gonna get it, but we're gonna fool 'em, ain't we? Yes, ma'am. I know you ain't scared of 'em, so I'm a-going to tell you my secret. - Do you think you ought to? - Sure. They don't dare kill you the way they killed that other feller. - That other fella? - Sure. They tried to tell me he was one of Ollie fleagle's gang, but I know he wasn't 'cause he was too scared, so I didn't tell him the real secret. - Naturally. - But I'm a-gonna give it to you. Oh, I don't think you ought to give it to me, grandma. I... 1 never could keep a secret. I'm just a big blabbermouth. Besides, I'm not really Bonnie's boyfriend. That was just their idea. I know you ain't. They wasn't fooling me none, but I got to trust you. Ain't much time left. Read this. "The end of the trail for Ollie fleagle and his daughter, Bonnie, who was his accomplice in many daring raids. While Bonnie sobbed in her prison cell, fleagle marched to the gallows, refusing to disclose the hiding place of the $30,000 in bank loot.” Oh, so that's it. You mean you've got $30,000 in the house here? That's what they think, but it's 70,000 and it ain't in this house. Look, grandma, why don't you tell the family? After all, they're your relatives. We don't recognize no kinship. Them polecats come from a different branch of the fleagles. It's Bonnie's money. She's the one that stole it and she's the one that's gonna get it. Well, couldn't you just mail it to her? I've got some stamps right here. The one with the music on 'em. - Can you read music? - A little bit. I used to play saxophone with the home office orchestra. Hum it to me. Oh. That's it, that's it. I just wanted to see if it was right. - Very catchy. - Get that to Bonnie. She'll know what it means, and tell her this: "To them what doesn't know the tune sounds like the ravings of a loon." It certainly does. Get that window, quick! Is it a lit-up dog? Like a torch. That's the sign. I'm a-going now for sure. Every time there's gonna be a death in this house, a hound lights up and makes for the woods. Yeah, but that's the second one I've seen tonight. Does that mean that maybe I'm... Grandma... Grandma, does that mean that may... Grandma. Oh. - Ain't you finished yet? - No, we ain't finished yet. We'll be through in a minute. Close that door, you varmints. Psst! Psst, psst. I see the poor old woman has given up the ghost. How'd you get in here? In the same manner in which I propose to get you out of here. - Oh, fine, Mr. Johnson, let's go. - Oh, providing, of course, you share grandma's little secret with me. She didn't give me any secret. She gave me this thing with some notes on it. Come, come, come. Half the loaf is better than none. Look, Mr. Johnson, I don't want any of the loaf. All want to do is get out of this place. Precisely why I am here. Me too, Mr. Johnson. Oh, hello, mert, my boy. I ain't mert and I ain't your boy. Merely a figure of speech. You wasn't aiming to strike up a bargain with this fella, was you, Mr. Johnson? Bert, I'm astounded, that's perfectly ridiculous. - Isn't it, young man? - Yes, very ridiculous. Save your talk. You and me is gonna chew the fat later. You been living too long, Mr. Johnson. Now, please, Bert, we're in the presence of the grim reaper. - Huh? - Uh, the reaper, you know? It cuts hay. Of course you can use a sickle. Listen, you, it don't take no schooling to know that 50/50 means half for me and half for you. Now start to talk. Well, all she did was give me this thing. She's been making them things for years. Now where did she say the money was? Well, she did say it wasn't in the house. I don't want to know where it ain't. I want to know where it is. Well, does this mean anything to you, "to them that doesn't know the tune sounds like the ravings of a loon"? Doesn't. Look, you, I don't like poems. Now where's the money? What's going on in here? Aw, we was just talking, ma. They seem to have the idea that... Grandma's gone, my sweet. Oh, yeah? Pretty shameful when a woman can't trust her own brood. I'd have told you, ma, honest, but he ain't said nothing... yet. Get out of the way, ma, and let me draw a bead on him. No cause for violence yet. You're perfectly right, Mrs. Johnson. The young man is being very evasive, my pet. What are you doing in here? I thought you was going over to get some lumber. Oh, so I was, it completely escaped my mind. I'll go right away. - Now where's the money? - She didn't tell me where the money is. Look, Mrs. Johnson, here. That's all she gave me, that thing with the notes on it, didn't ya? Don't you play innocent with me. I'm not playing innocent with ya! Maybe the tune will mean something to ya. Honor flysis, income beezis. Onches nobis, inob keesis. - Elany, get out of here. - I found him, ma. Oh, but he don't talk. He don't even move. Didn't I tell you to stay out of there? I ought to whack her one. Why won't he talk to me? I don't know, now go on back to your room. But he's got his bump on his head bigger than a yam. - Well, I can't help it. - It spoiled his hair. And it was so nice and curly. Elany, can't you see your ma has got company? How do you do? Say, ma, he's got curly hair too. It's not really curly. It straightens right out the minute it gets wet. Oh, I'll be careful. Oh, you can mess with the feller's hair later. - Now, look here, mister. - I like you. Do you want this? No thanks, I just had one. Now, elany, get out of here! Are you gonna tell us where it is, or am I gonna have to bash it out of ya? All right, I'll tell ya. Ha-ha, now you're talking business. Where is it? Well, I'll have to show you. It's, uh, it's outside in the yard. All right, get going. Well, here's the weeping Willow tree. Now where's the money? Is this the big weeping Willow tree? It's the only one. Oh, well, I guess this is the one, then. - Where's the money? - Don't confuse me. This requires a little thought. Now, let me see, she said, "three paces from the big weeping Willow tree toward the main road.” - Now where is the main road? - That way. That way. All right. Pardon me, Mrs. Johnson. One, two, three is right there. - Do we dig here? - Oh, no. No, no. This is just the first Mark. Now would you mind standing right there, Mrs. Johnson? That would help a great deal. From this point, we go directly toward that little sycamore tree right there. - It's an oak. - Well, I mean the little oak. Eight feet. Three, six, seven, eight. - Is this it? - No, no, no. This is just the second Mark. I know this all sounds a little involved, but there's a lot of money involved. Now, [I'll just take that rope there, Bert. - I'm mert. - I'm Bert. Oh. Oh, you're the one with the crick in the back, aren't you? Well, Bert, you better hold the lantern. You wouldn't want to do any digging with a crick in your back. Now, just hold the lantern so I'll know which one you are. Oh, Mrs. Johnson, you've moved off your Mark here. I think just back here a little bit, that's right. Could you bring the light over here? Oh, yes, right up here. There we are. Now, Mrs. Johnson, if you'll just hold the end of this rope there right like that. That's it. Now, right over this Mark, right there. Now, from this point on, we have to be very careful. Let me see, Jupiter, Venus. Ah, there we are, the big Dipper. Sixty-two feet, eight and a half inches right down the handle of the big Dipper. Right that way. Hold the line tight there, and you with the lamp better come along. Right, three, six, nine, twelve... Fifteen. Yeah. Fifteen. Eighteen, let's see, yeah. Hm. Thirty-six. Oh, yes, here are the twin trees, we're going right. Around there, mm-hm. Let's see, 62 feet, eight and one-half inches right here. - Is this it? - Well, if my calculations are correct, this is it. Now if you just Mark that spot right there. You want to double-check it before we send for the shovels. All right, just right along that line there. Right in line with the brother, you want to be sure. I thought you were the one with the crick. Oh! Don't stand there, get after him! Oh, you and your crick! Go get him! Oh, ma! Get up! Guess he got away. Ma! Ma! Oh. You know, instead of going straight down the handle of the big Dipper, I think, possibly, we should've gone down the handle of the little Dipper this way. Ooh! Get him. My dear, what happened? How did he get out of here? - Did he talk yet? - Stop asking so many fool questions. Oh-ho! Oh, no! Ooh! Boys! Wait, boys. Wait. Well, we're listening. I just happened to think, maybe it was 68 feet, two and a half inches instead of 62 feet, eight and a half inches. Maybe if we went outside again. Oh! Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Ah! What's going on in here? What do you mean busting in like this? - I'll throw her out, ma. - Take it easy, gruesome. I'm the one that'll do the throwing out. - Who be ya? - I'm Bonnie fleagle, that's who, and I'll ask the questions around here. Well, we're fleagleses too. Yeah? Yeah, your uncle Clint was my first husband. Oh, so you're aunt mamie, huh? That's right, Bonnie. How'd you get out of the jailhouse? Ain't no clink can hold me. All right, come on, let's have it. What are you all doing here? Well, Bonnie, when we heard your poor old grandma was ailing, we closed the house at jawbone and drove up to see if we could help her. Yeah, help her find my money. We had planned on keeping it for you. - That's right. - Oh, yeah, sure. Who's the field mouse? Oh, that's my husband, Mr. Johnson. - Them? - Them is my twin boys. - That's, uh... - I'm mert, ma. I'm Bert. And that's elany, my youngest. Elany, say hello to your cousin Bonnie. Bonnie? J honors flysis, income beezis j j onches nobis, inob keesis j what kind of gibble-gabble is that? Oh, nothing. Elany ain't so bright, but she's awful sweet. The children are all by a former marriage, of course. The acrobat too? Oh, I'm not a member of the family. I just dropped in here by mistake. I'm with the trotter poll. Grandma told him where the money is and we're trying to get it out of him. Do we have to go through all that again? She didn't tell me anything. All she gave me was this. - Where is grandma? - Upstairs. She passed on just a few moments ago. It was very touching. She was poisoned, that's what. Poison? Who did it? I don't know, but it looked like somebody gave her a thousand-watt Mickey Finn. Okay, you, lead the way to grandma's room. You and me is gonna have a little talk. - Now look here... - Get back! Go mix me up some vittles, I'm hungry. Come on, you, get going! You won't muss his hair, will ya, Bonnie? Look, there's really no need for me to go up with you. Your grandmother just told me to give you this and that you'd know exactly what it means. Good luck to you. Get up those stairs. Now we ain't gonna get nothing. Let us not despair, my sweet. Okay, I'm not like those nitwits downstairs. - I mean business. - I don't know where the money is! All I know is that I came out here looking for a fella named smedley. He's also with the trotter poll. Then a dog lights up, then grandma lights up, and then I'm your sweetheart, and then another dog lights up, and then grandma dies and tells me to give you that sampler and to tell you that "them that doesn't know the tune sounds like the ravings of a loon." Ooh! Hands up. Mm. Oh, that cigar. Not as dumb as you thought you were, huh? Please don't go, I'm not Bonnie fleagle. - You're not? - No, I'm Claire Matthews and I'm in a jam. Oh! Well, I'm Pete Marshall. I've been in a jam all night, up to here. I'm getting out. If you're not Bonnie fleagle, what are you doing here? Trying to find $70,000. I've got to find it. How'd you know it was 70,0007? - The paper said it was only 30. - My father told me. It's on his account I'm here. - Was he one of the gang? - Oh, no, but they said he was. He was in the bank working on the books the night of the robbery, and to make things easier for themselves, the fleagles claimed he was in on it. If I can just find the money, I can clear him. Look, you haven't got a chance of finding it, these people are maniacs. They'd just as soon cut your throat as peel an apple. I think they've even done away with Hector smedley, one of our best men, and he wasn't even looking for the money. Now come on, get out of here. We can figure out something later. I can think better outside, come on. I'm staying, you go if you want to. Okay, it's your throat. I'll manage somehow. Why did your father have to be working in the bank that night? If he'd done his work in the daytime, I could have been out of here. Now... hey, here they come, here. Come on, beat me. No, no, oh, ow! Okay, I've had enough of your stalling! Where's that dough? Where is it, I said. Well, what do you want? Ma sent us up to fetch grandma down. Won't take but a shake, Bonnie. Well, get her and get out. Come on, make it snappy. See what they did to grandma? You better hit me again. - Come on, stand still! - Ouch! Ooh! Oh! Oh, did I hurt you? I'm sorry. After what I've been through tonight, what's a broken jaw? Didn't the grandmother give you any ideas to where to look? I repeat, all she gave me was that sampler. Said you'd know what it means, I mean said Bonnie would know what it means. It just has notes on it. If it had some words like "deep in the heart of Texas," we could start looking in Dallas. Well, maybe the tune means something. - Do you know how it goes? - Yeah, it's that double talk thing elany was singing downstairs, you know, that: J honors flysis, something sneezes, da-da-da j what can you make out of that? Not a thing. Here we go again. Oh! - No, wait till they get in. - Oh. J honors flysis, income beezis j j onches nobis, inob keesis j that's it. Elany, what do those words mean? - Bonnie knows. - Yes, I know I do, dear, but I've kind of forgotten. Will you tell me again? You won't spoil his hair, will you, Bonnie? No, I promise you she won't, elany. Just tell her what the words mean. J honors flysis, income beezis j j onches nobis, inob keesis j there you are. Now you know right where to look for it. It's got to be here somewhere. But it's like looking for a needle in a slaughterhouse. Please, let's get out of here while that ladder is still there. I'm staying until I find that money. All right, what else did she tell ya? Come on out with it! - Didn't he talk yet? - No, he didn't, but he's gonna. I did too, I told you everything. You did not! Only come up to tell ya your vittles is ready. Well, I'll be right down. Now close the door! I set a place for you too, mister. Oh, that's very nice of you, but I don't think I can eat a thing, really. There's aplenty. Why on earth would you say you told me everything? I was just using my head. Now they think we both know the secret and they won't dare kill either one of us. No, unless they decide to kill both of us. Yeah. Yes! - Yes. - Oh, come on. Well, shall we jump or shall we eat? Oh, let's go down, we might find out something. Okay, take me down. Careful with that thing, huh? - Good evening, folks. - Good evening. Sit there, mister. This way, Bonnie. This is grandma's chair. We know she would've wanted you to sit in her place. How do you know? She's dead, ain't she? - Shut up! - Mm, something smells mighty good. - Hominy grits. - Hominy grits. My favorite dish. Is this the gravy? Leave it be! Ain't much of it, and what there is is for Bonnie. I don't care for no gravy. Grits ain't no good without gravy, honey child. Better have a little. Mighty dry without it. Doesn't anybody else get gravy? - No. - We don't like gravy. I like gravy. Little children should be seen and not heard. Isn't it appalling the way children are raised these days? Oh! Uh... Uh, Bonnie... l mean, if Bonnie doesn't like it, why make her eat it? I mean, it might disagree with her. Why not give it to somebody that likes it? - Ya can't have it. - Oh, I didn't mean that I... Ah, cut the arguing. Here, swap plates with me. Thanks. L, uh, I don't want to be a pig about this, but would you care for it, Mr. Johnson? No, no, thank you. Madam? The gravy is for Bonnie and Bonnie is gonna get it! Oh, a lazy Susan, huh? Yes, a little innovation of mine. I find it helped solve the serving problem. It's very clever. It works both ways, you see? Saves a great deal of time. Uh-huh. You seem to have ended up with my plate over there. Mine was the one with the bread on it, I believe. I just wanted the bread. Get your own. There! You have my plate again. Well, uh, shall we eat? Leave the table be! Well, I just wanted the pickle. Horseradish. - Pepper. - Oh, pepper? Just a minute. There you are, right there. Get off of me! Where's the plate with the gravy? The grits seem to have absorbed the gravy. You and your contraptions. Well, the plate with the gravy had the piece of bread on it. I got the bread. What plate did you get it from, elany? The one with the gravy. Well, I ain't eating till I know where it is. - Me neither. - Me neither. Oh, it's very confusing. Well, I, uh, I know one sure way of finding out. Oh! Well... Well, I found more than I expected. Ah, it's incredible. - Well, I'll be dogged. - Hey, what do ya know? They is all lit up. Oh, grits is pretty like that. Who done it? It was only supposed to be... So you was aiming to bump me off, was you, mamie? There ain't no call accusing me. My grits has got it too, ain't they? Mr. Johnson's plate hasn't anything on it. Where is Mr. Johnson? He's the one who done it. Why, it's him. Boy, he's really glowing. Something he ate, no doubt. - Poor Mr. Johnson. - Serves him right. So that's what they were going to do to me. Yes, but Mr. Johnson's little innovation seems to have backfired. I'm not so sure about that. What do you mean, Mrs. Johnson? Why, I never even saw a grit before. Well, I know one thing. You're all packing and clearing out of here quick. - Oh, no, we ain't. - You heard me. No need to argue. We'll get out, Bonnie. With Mr. Johnson gone, nothing here means nothing no more. Well, then get going. We got a few chores to do, but we'll be cleared out by daybreak. See that you are. Okay, come on, you. “Who me? Yeah. How 'bout it, ma? Not yet. Well, pick him up and tote him out of here. Him and his innovations. Boy, was that something. I never saw anything like that in my life. That goes on in this house all the time. That's just the way grandma went out. Although, I do think that Mr. Johnson had a little more candle power. - What does it mean? - Don't ask me. I'm no electrician. Just wish I'd brought a box lunch, that's all. Well, at least we're getting rid of the fleagles. Yeah, or vice versa. Oh, let's forget them and find the money. Oh, sure, find the money. All we have to do is find somebody that knows what the... Say, you've been around here a long time. Does this mean anything to you? - Honors flysis, something pleases. - You're a great help. Well, Dr. trotter's instructions didn't tell us how to decipher a footstool cover. Oh, no, it couldn't. - What? - Oh, it's silly. Did you see the Bob hope picture ghost breakers? - The one with the zombie? - Yeah, remember when they had the organ? Come here. Remember, they played a combination of notes on the organ that operated a gimmick that opened the door to the hiding place. In a place like this? It couldn't be. Well, what have we got to lose? It worked for them, didn't it? Now you watch and see if anything happens. I can't watch and play at the same time. - Anything happening? - No. Maybe I'll try it down here. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. It's working, go on, play. It's coming from down there. It's coming closer. - In here. - Well, that works without the organ. J honors flysis, income beezis j j onches nobis, inob keesis j fine. What other movies have you seen? Look, elany, your grandmother hid a lot of these someplace, do you know where? Maybe down in the well, or up in the attic? Or maybe down in there someplace, hm? Huh? Grandma was tetched. - Ah, she was. - Uh-huh. J honors flysis, income beezis, onches nobis, inob keesis j& well, maybe grandma was tetched, but I'm not so sure about that character. You wait here, I'm gonna follow her. Hey, do you think you better? What do you want? I... 1 just come in to get my shawl! Grandma left it to me. Stay out of here. Uh, nice organ you've got here. - Whoal! - Get going. - Where? - Get. W... where, don't you want me to play anymore? - Get down. - What for? You're going where you will talk. Yeah, but I don't do anything- get. Oh! Why, Hector smedley. What are you doing down there? Yes, come right up, Hector, here. There's nobody here but the twins and me, yeah, give me your hand. Pardon us, fellas. Well... oh, Hector, well, you almost fell. Look at you, you're so peaked. Here, you better sit down... here, stand there. Now, sit down. Hector, where have you been, your clothes are all dirty. You were? Well, what were you doing there, that... that's a funny place to be. Of course, you always were the outdoor type, weren't ya? Well, anyway, I'm mighty glad to see ya, Hector, we've been pretty worried about you. Dr. trotter couldn't understand why you... You what? You've been killed? Hector, do you mean to say that you're sitting there dead? Grandma told me that she'd be sending some spirit back to haunt this house but I certainly didn't think she meant you. I can put my hand right through you, Hector. Creepy, isn't it? Tell me, Hector, what happened to you, you were always such a picture of health. Hit on the head, huh? Yes, yes, I'd like to see it, yeah. Oh, oh here, I'll take your hat off. Yeah, you got a lump on your head bigger than a yam. Uh, Hector, you better lean back here. Wait, I'll put this behind you. - Can you see him? - Not very plain. There, now lean back there. That's right... that better? Now... oh, pardon me, Hector. Tell me, Hector, who did it? Hm? They did? Bert hit him. - Well, you held him. - Well, ma made me. Why would they do a thing like that, Hector? Because they thought you knew where the money was? Why, that was pretty silly of them, wasn't it? I mean, like they think I know where the money is, and if they killed me, they'd never find it, would they? Even if I knew where it was, which I don't. Oh, come now, Hector, that's not like you, holding a grudge. Remember, you're a trotter man. I... l mean, you were a trotter man. Besides, these fellas were just trying to find some money that's rightfully theirs. Isn't that right, fellas? No, Hector, not the knife! Shame on you, taking the law into your own hands! Now drop it, put it down. Hector, drop it. I'm sorry I had to use force, Hector. Yes, maybe the electric chair, that's what it's for. Both of them? Well, I don't think both of them, Hector, he only held you. Yes, you're right, he is an accomplice, mm-hm. That means you're as guilty as he is, you'll fry too. Well, ma ought to get it, then. Yeah, she ought to get it, then. Oh, wait a minute, Hector, I don't think they use the electric chair in this state. Uh, if you kill somebody in this state, they, uh, they hang you, don't they? Yes, they hang in this state... What'd you say, Hector? Oh, no, no I don't think they'd mind. Uh, how 'bout the dining room? He, uh, wants to talk to me alone. Oh, let me help you, Hector. Up we go, easy does it, that's right. There we go. Oh, come on, after you, Hector. There... What'd you say I hit him for? What'd you say I held him for? Well, I wasn't gonna take all the blame. Me neither. Wait till ma hears you telled on her. You snitch and I'll blast ya. Well. Now, smedley, you come back here, you're not going to the police. Now come in here, settle this thing once and for all. No, smedley! Not that, no, put it down! Look out, he's got another knife! Hey. Ney do you mind? - Do... do you see him? - No, I think we lost him. - Guess he's upstairs chasing mert. - I'm mert. Oh, I guess he's chasing Bert then. Hey, uh, I think you're on my leg, right there. Pete? - Hey, you! - Yeah, what's the matter? Somebody in that room just grabbed me and tried to choke me. Well, we've had quite a bit of excitement down here ourselves. - Yeah. - Well, I'll, uh, I'll take a look. Maybe you fellas better watch down here. - Not me, I ain't staying down here all alone. - Me neither. There's nobody in here now. I was right over here by this corner when I got grabbed... Oh, oh! “What's the matter? Down there on the floor. Wait, I'll light a match. It's ma. Whatcha doing down there, ma? There's your choker. - Did you shoot her? - I couldn't have, she was out in the hall. Well, who did it then? Couldn't have been us, we were downstairs. Whoever it was must've choked her too. Oh, no, choking wouldn't put a yam on her head like that. Ugh! Uh, maybe she just tripped over her whip. - I'll bet you conked her. - I never touched her. There weren't no one else up here. But, uh, maybe it was smedley. Oh, no it couldn't have, he was downstairs chasing us. Oh yeah, that's right. But remember, we lost him. Uh, I think. - Well, get her out of here. - Yeah, uh, get her out of here. What did you hit her for? I didn't. She was out in the hall just as I said. Oh, well who did it then? I mean, it wasn't the twins, know it wasn't me. There must be somebody else around here. - I know there is. - Elany. - Oh, no. - No, I guess it wouldn't be elany. Well maybe there are some fleagles around here we haven't met. You know what I think? “What? - I think we ought to get out of here. - Oh, Pete. We've gone this far, we can't quit now. Besides, I've got to stay. Okay, look, what were you doing when whoever it was tried to choke you? I was over here by the bureau kneeling down. Suddenly, the lights went out, I turned, and he grabbed me. - Uh-huh. - And you know, Pete, I had the strangest feeling that he came right out of that wall. - Out of the wall? - Well, I'm almost positive... Hey, wait a minute. You know, earlier this evening right after grandma died, I was over by that window trying to climb out, and all of a sudden, Mr. Johnson was standing right here. Now he couldn't have come through the door because I had it blocked with a chair and I'm sure he didn't come through the window. He must've come through here someplace. _ - Pete. - Hm? The sampler, it's gone. - Well, I'm glad we're rid of that thing. - Oh, no, Pete, don't you see? That's what he was after, that proves it really means something. - We've got to get it back. - Yeah, well, let's just do one thing at a time. Let's find out how people get in here. Maybe they come down the chimney. Suppose it's a phony fireplace? Sounds pretty solid. Let's see. Well, I don't think anybody can come down there. Never heard of a fireplace with a false bottom, did ya? I don't think there's anything in there, no. Hm. Pete, what's the matter? Hm? What is it? Somebody hit me on the head. Oh, guess I just knocked a brick loose. Aw, here, let me look at it. - Is it bleeding? - No, but you've got a peach of a bump. Oh, well I don't think anybody came out of there. - Well, ugh. - Oh, here, there's some water over here. I'd like a nice, hot shower. Thanks. Your face, too. - There? - Mm-hm. Say, uh, maybe there's a secret door in the back of the closet here. Oh, no, he... if he'd come out of there, you would've seen him if you... Give... give me the gun, there's somebody in there! All right, you, come out of there with your hands up and your lights on. Come on, all right, come on. Yipe! It's me. What? There's nobody in there but me, and I... I'm poisoned! - Poisoned? - Yeah, I lit up like a floor lamp. - What are you talking about? - I'm glowing. - But, Pete, you're not. - Yes, I am... here, I'll show ya. - Look. - Oh! - There, you see? - Oh, yes, but how? - I don't know but I'm sure glowing. - Well, did you eat anything? - No. - Did you drink anything? - No! - Do you feel sick? Yes, of course I feel... no, I feel fine. Except for that lump on my head, that couldn't have done it, could it? Here, give me your finger. Now, hold that in here. Ah-ha, mm-hm. - It's the water. - Yeah, I guess it probably only kills you if you drink it, you probably have to take it internally. Oh! Oh! He's after me, he's after me! - Don't let him get me! - What are you talking about? The one who whupped me, he's after me. - Who's after you? - The ghost. - He's got a club now. - Uh-huh. Oh, you mean smedley, uh-huh, what'd I tell ya? He whupped me too. - You won't let him get me again, will ya, Bonnie? - Get 'em up. Now we're talking Turkey. Look out behind you, there's smedley! Ha! You don't think I believe none of that fiddle-faddle, do ya? You mean, you don't believe in the manifestation of the hyperphysical? I only believe in what I can see. - Well, who's been going around popping us on the... - Shut up! - Now, you hand that money over, hon. - Gotta find it first. Yeah, she didn't find the money, Mrs. Johnson. I told her everything I know but hasn't dug up 15 cents. Are you handing it over or do we start a-shooting? Uh, I wouldn't start shooting, Mrs. Johnson, I... you know it just occurred to me that it would be pretty silly to kill her. I ain't asking ya, hand it over. Look, Mrs. Johnson, she's an escaped convict, that means there's at least $10,000 on her head, uh, maybe more. Of course, we'd have to turn her in alive. Uh, where would we be if we killed her? Nobody'd get a nickel. - It ain't bad calculating, ma. - Maybe. Remember, Mrs. Johnson, a bird in the hand. Now, here we've got $10,000 we're sure of. Why spend a lot of time looking around here for some money that probably doesn't even exist? All we have to do is take her down to the sheriff, hand her over, and he hands over the money, just like that. - Ain't no jail can hold me. - Shut your trap. Yeah, shut your trap. Uh, $10,000 right under our noses and we almost passed it up. Good I thought of it. Come on, you. - You're awful ignorant, mister. - Huh? - You know too much. - Oh, you don't have to worry about me telling about all the murder... I mean, all the little things that have happened around here. When it comes to keeping my mouth shut, I'm a regular clam. - Shall I splatter him now, ma? - No. - Splatter him outside. - Splatter? - Get going. - This hardly seems fair... - After all, the reward thing was all my idea. - Come on. Oh, no, oh I'm poisoned, I think I'm glowing, turn off the light. Oh, I think I'm glowing, turn off the light! Woo, woo-hoo-hoo! Oh, mm, oh! Why he is a-glowing, ain't he? - Yeah, he's got it sure enough. - Well, whatcha know? Serves him right. Snooping in the kitchen, huh? Water, water... oh, no, no, no, water! No, ugh... - No! - Who do you suppose done it? She did it to me, it was in that sandwich she made me eat. Sure I did it, ain't gonna testify against me. Now, uh, I'm a-goin' fast. You folks go down and get the reward, just let me stay here. Coming, smedley. Ugh. Ugh. Well, just save us gunpowder, get him out of here. - Shall I heave him out the window, ma? - No! They'll see the glow clean to plainville... Chuck him in the cellar. Well, whatcha choosing? Go ahead and get the reward, but I'll be a-comin' back. Ha! Maybe you will, maybe you won't. Keep and eye on her while I get her belongings. If she makes a wrong move, give her both barrels. Uh-huh. Shh! - I think it's safe to go now. - Safe? - To go where? - To the hideout. - Huh? - What about the money, was it all there? - What money? - You know, the $30,000 I gave you - to stash in the truck. - What $30,000... Shh! - To stash in what truck? - You told me you had a shack up near jawbone where you'd hide me out if I split the money with ya. Oh, I ain't got no shack, you didn't give me no money. Why yes I did, you took it right from me. Wrapped it up in that old newspaper and took it out to the truck. - L1 did? - Sure. - What are you gonna do with your cut? - Huh? Oh, well, I'm gonna get me a new gun and a bird dog and a saddle pony and... Hey, I don't remember you giving me all this money. Hey, wait a minute. What are you trying to pull? I ain't trying to pull nothing, honest, Bonnie. - Give me the keys to the truck. - Oh, now I get it. Get what? This. Oh, please! Don't, don't. J honors flysis, income beezis, oh... j j onches nobis, inob keesis j - Elany, who was that? - He hit me, he hit me. - Who, honey, who? - He's dead and he hit me. Honey, tell Bonnie who is was. He made me sing and then he hit me, and he kicked tater, too. Oh, he hurt tater! - Honey tell me who... - Oh, don't hit me. I don't want to sing, I don't want to, I don't want to. - Elany, what is this, what does it mean? - Oh, don't hit me. Don't hit me again... Honors flysis, income beezis. Honey, I'm not going to hit you... Look who wrote this? - Ghost did. - Oh, there aren't any ghosts, elany. - Who was it? - Ghosts ain't nobody 'cause they're dead. Oh, don't let him come back again, oh, don't! The sampler! Here, nice doggy, give it to me, doggy. Give it to me, that's good dog... drop it, drop it. Give it to me. That's it, give it to me. That's a dog. Oh! - This is for letting her get away. - Cut it out! - That's for slapping her. - Cut it out! That's for me getting whupped. - This is for poor Mr. Johnson. - No more! That's a good dog. Now, give me... oh no! - Get out of the way! - Ouch! Nice bowser, nice bowser... Give me the sampler. Oh! Ain't you dead yet? Not yet. I'll kill ya if I have to do it 20 times. Thanks very much, whoever you are. Keep a-settin' right where you are. Keep a... Oh, all right. - Who are you? - I'm asking you the same thing. And if you aint' a fleagle you're in trouble. Oh, I'm a fleagle all right, sure, sure. - Which one? - I'm the twins. I'm mert, no I... I'm Bert, Bert, I'm Bert. - Make up your mind. - Well, I'm the short one. Well, I'm Bonnie. The real... uh, well, cousin Bonnie! How'd you get out, Bonnie? There ain't no jail that can hold me. No, no, that's what I hear. - Whatcha doing around here? - Uh, we all drove up from jawbone when we heard that grandma was ailing. - Ailing? - Yup. Old Pearl could've just up and croaked. - What's eating on you? - Uh, rats around here bigger than buffalo. Keep getting them in my still, makes the stuff taste awful. - Didn't grandma leave me no word? - Uh, nope, nope, just said goodbye and croaked, that's all. - Where'd she leave my money? - Oh, didn't tell me nothing about no money. Uh, maybe she told ma, ma's out in the barn, way out in the barn. J honors flysis, income beezis, honors flysis, income beezis & - where'd you get that song? - Song? Oh, we sing it around here all the time, catchy ain't it? - So grandma did leave me a message. - She did? Yeah, that song... sing it again, slow. Uh, I can't sing it slow, when I sing it slow, I lose the tune. - Sing it slow or you'll lose your teeth. - Oh, ow! Come on sing it, sing it slow. J honors flysis j wait a minute, honors flysis. - On a horse's flies. - On a horse's flies? Come on, what comes after that, hurry up. - Lincome beezis. - Llncome beezis. - In a comb is bees. - Well, what do you know? We never thought it meant nothing around here. Never mind that, what comes after income beezis? - Come on, let me hear it. - I never heard no more of it. - Come on, I want to hear it right now. - I don't know any more. J honors flysis, income... I I better sing the first part over again, honors flysis... - Shut up. - Ow! - Who's that? - That's my little sister, elany. - Maybe she knows the rest of it. - No, no, she's even stupider than I am. Well, guess I better get to work on my still again. Hm, hm, hm... Dee-Dee, Dee-Dee... Oh! Look, I'm saying I'm Bonnie fleagle, and if you want me to prove it to ya, just keep shooting off your trap. There's some kind of fiddle-faddle going on around here... how come you.. I ain't got no time to argue, I want to see the dame that was singing that song. - And quick. - Listen, you ain't got no call to come in here - and order... - Are you gonna get her for me or not? - All right, I'll fetch her. - Look here, if you're Bonnie, who's that other... Shut up. Claire. Don't give me none of that junk, 'cause I ain't falling for it, see? - This here's the lady. - But I tell you there was another Bonnie - around here. - Shut up. - Listen, you, sing me that song. - I don't want to, I'm afraid. - Sing it, you hear me? - Oh, don't hit me! Oh, go on sing it, honey, this here's Bonnie, the real Bonnie. - I don't wanna! - Oh, come on, sing me the song - or I'll knock your teeth in! - I don't want to! Come on and sing it, elany, come on out with it! Honors flysis, income beezis, onches nobis, inob keesis. Come on, sing it again, and slow. - Claire. - Pete! Oh! Oh, am I glad to see you. Yeah, I am glad to see you, I thought maybe they'd hit you over the head or something. I found the secret passageway. Yeah, I... l see you did. - It goes to elany's room. - Uh-huh, that's fine. - Well, uh, wait till you hear what I've found. - What, the money? Bonnie fleagle's here, the real Bonnie fleagle. Oh, Pete, she can't be, she's in jail! Ain't no jail can hold her. Oh! Oh well, don't you think we better get out of here? Oh now, Claire, we've gone this far... Do I think we ought to get out of here? - I'd better go first. - Mm-hm. You know, I found out something else, you know that silly song, - "honors flysis, income beezis"? - Mm-hm. It's not as silly as we thought, it's like mairzy doats. "Honors flysis" means on horses there are flies. "Income beezis" means in combs there are bees. - Well, what about the rest of it? - I've forgotten the rest of it. Well, wait a minute, Pete, I've got it written out right here. Yeah, well let's figure it out in plainville over a hot cup of coffee. Oh, no, Pete, please come here, look. Look, now what did you say it meant? "Honors flysis, income beezis.” It's very simple, I don't know why we didn't figure it out before. "Honors flysis" means on horses are flies. "Income beesis," in combs are bees, see, it's very simple. It would be all right if we were looking for honey with a fly in it. Well, wait a minute, come here, what about the rest of it? - Onches nobis. - Onches nobis. On... on chest nob is. That means there's a knob with a chest on it... I mean, a chest with a knob on it, now come on. Oh, I get it, come... "Onches nobis, inob keesis." “Inob keesis..." In a knob, there's a key! - Yeah, that's right you got it, now come on. - Oh, Pete, that's it. - That's what we've been looking for! - That's right, isn't it? All we have to do is find a chest with a knob with a key. Yeah! Oh, well, we'll... We'll come back again sometime. Oh, Pete, come here, boy, please, we can't leave now. Look, in town police is... Now come on, please. Oh, wait a minute, I'm caught. Pete! What's the matter? What are you doing in there? Oh, the nobis... I mean, the knob. - Oh, Pete! - Well, let me try. - Maybe it opens in the back here. - Don't get excited. I'm not excited. - Here, let me try... you got a hairpin or something? - No. - Oh, it twists. - Well, let me, let me. - A key. - Oh, what does it open? Here let me... safe deposit box, midbury national bank, $70,000. - Grandmas said it was in the house. - Oh, Pete, that's it we've got it! - Yeah, all we have to do is find midbury. - Uh-huh. Onh! “What's the matter? It's mert, or Bert, or... The passageway. Stand aside. Oh! Claire! Oh! They beat us to it. - Get after them, mert! - Can't move it! Down this way... There's another passageway! Goes right back to grandma's room. - Come on, Pete. - Oh! - Pete, what is it? - I'm through the ceiling. Oh, here. Well, bust it in! We'll duck. Down there. Just wait till I get ahold of them. Oh... there, there. - Is that you, mert? - Yup, yup... yup, it's me. - Where'd they go? - They went down this way. - I can't hardly see nothing. - They must've come through here, keep going. We can't let them get away! - Keep moving, mert, keep moving. - I'm moving as fast as I can too. Ow! Get off my finger! What are trying to do, break my neck? Get up and let me get by, will ya? I'm trying to, I'm trying to, - can't you see I'm stuck? - Stop pushing. I hear 'em. Come on! Get moving, mert. - Somebody light the lamp. - Ain't go no matches, ma. - I got one, where is the lamp? - There, here is it. Okay, ma. - See 'em? - Nope! I don't see nobody yet. Come on, get that thing lit, mert. I'm trying to, but it's awful windy down here. Who's got a match? I'm all out. Shh! - Oh, go back the other way. - What are you... l got 'em, let's go! There they go! Spread out. Door. - It's stuck. - Stand aside. Argh! Well, it drops off kind of sudden on this side. Pete! Pete, a car. Oh, if it'll only run! Get in the other side. - Hey, it runs! - I'll open the doors. No, no we'll crash right through them, put your head down, here we go. Oh, fine, it works that contraption. Maybe I can get it off the Jack. Pete! Pete! I see ya. Come on up out of there. Get your hands up. One move and I'll splatter ya. Mal! Woo-ee! I got 'em cornered in the barn! Come around and I got 'em! - Well! - Oh, you're wonderful. Thank you. Out that door. Climb up there. - Here, take my hand. - Oh, no, Pete! - Just close your eyes. - Oh! They're in the hay mill! They ducked in there... get in after 'em. They ain't here. Gotcha! Come on, reach for it. Cousin Bonnie, I didn't know that was you chasing... Don't give me no more of that stuff, wise guy. - Just give me the key. - The key, I... - Come on, let's have it. - I haven't got the key. Let's have it. Oh! - Ow! - Let me at 'em! Mal! Aw, I didn't mean it, ma. Whoa! Ooh! Ugh! Ow! Ow... oh! That's Bert. Well, you were pretty handy with that pitchfork. - Thank you. - Let's see, there's mert, Bert, Bonnie, and ma. - Uh-huh, nothing more to worry about, is there? - Nope, that's all of them. - I'm afraid you overlooked one. - No, that's mert, b... - Mr. Johnson. - Well, it can't be! Oh, but it can... and is. - Oh, but you're supposed to be dead! - Yeah! Sorry to disappoint you. Oh, then... then you're the one that hit mert or Bert over the head - when he was choking me down in the cellar. - Uh-huh. - Well, thanks again. - But purely a selfish motive. I thought at the time you had the clue to the money. Oh... I didn't though, did I? No... not until later. Now, if you'll be good enough, I'll take that key. - Oh, uh... - I advise you not to procrastinate, because I'm also an expert marksman... oh! - I wonder what made him do that. - I don't know. If that's another one of his tricks, it's pretty silly. - The ghost is gone. - Elany! - Ghost is all gone. - Hey, you just came in the Nick of time, elany. He hit me, now I don't have to sing anymore. Don't have to sing anymore! - I'd forgotten all about elany. - Me too. - Well, at least we know... oh! - No! That's them, the whole caboodle of 'em. Except them two. Gather 'em up, boys. We'll have you out of there in a shake, son. Huh? Oh! No hurry, sheriff.
