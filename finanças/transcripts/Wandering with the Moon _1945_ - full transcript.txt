WANDERING WITH THE MOON Based on the novel by Walter Ljungquist CAST DIRECTOR No matter what, moon... so long as there's change. Release me from my cramped prison, beautiful moon! Is it far to Charlottendal? Just a short way. Thanks. I've heard that before. How far is your "short way"? About a kilometre or so. Can I buy charcoal there? Yes, at the old petrol station on the square. Can you buy it there at this time of night? Isn't that lovely! Wait a moment... the air is so lovely. And a new moon! Well? Well what? I asked if I can buy charcoal at this time? Yes, but you have to press the bell-button. Hey girls... curtsy to the moon and wish for something. Yeah, I have to press so many buttons. You don't always know if anyone will respond! You're amazing, Alfredsson! Always so monumentally grumpy! What did you wish for when you curtsied to the moon? If I told you, it wouldn't be fulfilled. Tres Joli, Tres Joli! Tres Joli ran away from me! You have to help me! Tres Joli... come back! That damned mutt! You have to see to your dog yourself! How about we walk for a bit while they look for the dog? It usually takes time to find him. He has a wonderful ability to disappear. They can catch up with us later Come on. Are you interested in the theatre? Oh yes. That's good... I'm an actress. Like to come and watch us at Gustafshamn tomorrow? No, I wouldn't be able to make it. I'll be at the station then. Are you going on a trip? No, I work there. I know just what that would be. You're the one who's always out late at night... and goes and dreams while other people are sleeping. I do? A sensitive type. I love sensitive types! As for me, I'm obtrusive, inquisitive, persistent, highly-strung and romantic. I know exactly what you want to say. Don't bother! There's no point. - You can take me as I am. - Yeah. I have such a strong desire to talk with you alone. even though I don't know you, don't know anything about you. An evening like this - with moonlight and the sound of corncrakes... Just feel it! - What's up? - It smells of hackberry. Would it be hackberry? - For sure. - That’s wonderful. Say you think it's wonderful. SAY you think it's wonderful! - It's wonderful. - Yes. And secretive and romantic. I breathe, I live, I exist! To think that 15 minutes ago, we knew nothing about each other. You didn't know I existed. We lived our lives in different places. Now we're on a road together not knowing a thing about each other... or if we'll ever meet again. You have such a nice neck. I know that it's terrible of me to say so... But I couldn't help saying it. I even wanted to stroke your neck... but I controlled myself. Wasn't that good of me? Yes. I didn't want to scare you. You may already be terrified. But please don't be afraid... It's just the way I am. - I'm not afraid. - And not annoyed? I'm not annoyed. That's good. My name's Pia... Pia Saerner. Dad is a CEO in Stockholm... the respectable type... awfully sensible and everything. He thinks I'm insane to be touring around the countryside. I think it's fun. You meet so many people... You experience so much. If Mum was still alive, it wouldn't have happened... for even mothers don't understand. Though, she was an actress before she was married... so she probably wanted me to be an actress. Your being so quiet is making me nervous. Say something, please! What did you wish from the moon? There are some things you mustn't give an answer to. I can't say until it's fulfilled. I'll let you know, if that happens. What's your name? Kaellander. Dan... I like it. We seem to be... so say that we're friends! We are friends. We found that mongrel, so we're on our way. Coming? No thanks, I'm walking. Where to? I'll write when my wish has come true. I know it will. Where have you been? Out, walking. - At this time of night? - So what? It's late! Why are you running around in the middle of the night? You end up walking around half asleep... and mess up your work. You have to keep things in order. When I was your age... You needn't tell me, Dad, I've heard it all before. I've heard it far too often. You've been a dreamer and pig-headed since your mother died. Don't talk about Mum! What the devil are you up to? What have you got to complain about? I think you're a good-for-nothing! Whatever is to become of you? Leave me alone, Dad. But... you should be ashamed! Why is it ME who should be ashamed? Really?! Are you implying that I should be ashamed? Well yes, I am. Of you. - When I was young... - Not again, Dad. Forgive me Dad, but I can't take more of this. - I'm going to bed. - Just who do you think you are? What's got into you?! I don't know. I'm tired of being obedient and living by the rules. I can't stand myself, you, or the office. Damned trains that come and go. So you can't stand me? No... not you either. Talking to me like that... I should throw you out! But I shan't. I know I've been wrong... I've been too nice and indulgent. Go to bed! Hey there! Do you have a moment? I won't delay you, if you haven't time. I'm in no hurry. I travel in shoelaces. But business is totally dead. You look as though you've been walking for quite a while. Where are you headed? Anywhere at all. I just walk for pleasure. You've nothing to fear from me.! Promise not to be afraid of me. I'm a magnanimous louse... a noble tapeworm... a name written in running water. But my stomach... and, if you'll forgive me mentioning them... my bowels... listen... are as empty as a drum. Nice rucksack. Very spacious. Is it heavy? What do you have in it? Couple of books... toothbrush, pyjamas, shirt, socks... And that's it! Don't you worry about me... I just hoped you might've forgotten listing something in your rucksack. But I don't care what's in your rucksack. Good morning! - Know who that was? - Wasn't he a stationmaster? That's him. He lives up there. I was in his kitchen a little while ago. The door was open, so I just went in. One thing was odd... The pantry door was ajar. I looked at the pantry door and thought it should be closed. Pantry doors are supposed to be closed. No sign of anyone. Opportunity makes the thief I snuck quietly over to the door and took a look. There was cheese, smoked sausage, butter, bread and ham. But I closed the door. When I turned around, there was the stationmaster staring at me. "What are you doing there?" he said. "I closed the door," I said "You didn't intend stealing, did you?" he asked. "Yes, but I changed my mind, because it was too easy," I said. "So, you thought it was far too easy?" he said, So now you think you should get food, just because you didn't steal?" "Yes," I said... So I was kicked out. There's a fine new moral to that story. He knew exactly how to treat a man who was audacious enough to close the pantry door on his private property. Sorry, but there's no food in my rucksack. There's a general store nearby where we can buy something. Well, I certainly didn't misjudge you! You're a noble human being. Be careful! Maybe I made up that story. Makes no difference. Maybe I saw the stationmaster but he didn't see notice me. That won't matter anyway. Alright! I've warned you, so you've only yourself to blame! Taste's good. eh? There's only one word for it... delicious. Have you run off from home? - I haven't questioned you. - And I'm happy you haven't. I'm not a tramp, even though I'm tramping. That's all I care to say on the subject. I'm not inquisitive. You've been very decent to me... but I don't want to. Don't worry about it. I'm no tramp. I don't really know what you think of me. Don't be afraid of me. I'm no one to be afraid of. I'm not afraid. That's good. Thanks for the feed. I feel like I'm a thinking grub on a green leaf. I feel full. So nice to be able to stretch out properly. You feel like you've been trudging all night. Swirling clouds and birds chirping madly with joy... While a hundred crickets on the grass play zither... And he falls asleep, he goes to rest... the trees' compassionate crowns filter light across the poet Wennerbom the gentle chestnut rains down flowers, it's nice for poets to sleep. Nothing you owe, O Sextus no, not a penny. Debt only applies... ...to those who can pay. Gustafshamn Boarding House Now he's back again! Karlsson? No, the king of spades. Listen... you wouldn't mind... Go and ask your husband, dear lady! Very good of you. He thinks I care more about the boarding house than about him. You just go! I'll take care of the guests. That's awfully nice of you. Goodnight everyone. Save me from being married to a ship's mate who comes home and takes over! Yes, it's quite tedious. He goes and glares at her as if he was jealous of every man who comes here. It's like he was jealous of the boarding house. My dear, there are men who are jealous of harmless things. I once knew a man... ...who was jealous of the men in my terribly romantic novels. Do you think she's in love with him? I don't understand it. He's a young lout. Who can that be, now? Probably a new guest. What is it? I wondered if I could rent a room? Please come in. - For how long? - Only for one night. Yes, we have something on the first floor. Yes thanks, that'll be fine. I'm in a rush. How much is it? 2 kronor. Are you going out again? Is it far to the theatre from here? No, but it would be closed now. That doesn't matter. It would be good if I could borrow a front door key so I don't bother you. What was the name? Kaellander. There you are. It's room number 6. Perhaps you could mind this for me, so I don't have to take it with me? Good night. Sleep well. Sleep well yourself! Would you believe it! No one came although I pressed the button Why? To get charcoal for the bus. We can't go further without it. I knew this would happen... I could feel it. Knew what? The manager’s run off. - Run off? - Yes, run off! No one's been paid for a fortnight. And here am I stuck with a nice little bill. It's just crazy! I'm going to the hotel now, to get something to eat. I've got to get something inside me. I'm starving. - You don't have a brass farthing. - So what. In a place like this there's always someone willing and able to ask Miss Ohden to supper. - You're impossible! - Yes, and hungry! Miss Saerner! Goodness me! What are you doing here? I thought you had to be at the station. I've finished with them. Wonderful! I knew we would see each other again. Have you heard what happened? Yes, what will you do? I don't know. I can't afford to stay at the hotel. So did you hurry to get here? So what'll you do now? Phooey! I'm poor, but free and we have life in front of us. Tell me that's wonderful! But where will you go? Follow you. - May I? - What? Wherever you go, I'll come too. Yes, of course, but what are we going to do for money? What would you do if you were alone? Work... beg a bit. I'll help you with the begging. I'll sing and dance and pass the hat around. May I? Yes, sure... but... It'll be such fun! But then, where will we sleep? Just so long as we're together... I have a room, of course. Really? Where? A boarding house in town. - Why didn't you say so, right off? - No. Are you scared of sharing a room? Scared? No. Very well then... Hello, Lieutenant! Sorry? Don't you recognise me? Have I changed so much? I do apologize... I don't remember where we met... but I have an vague memory of... ...something pleasant when I see you. Unfortunately, I must... But please... don't look so terrified! I'm not dangerous. Won't you sit down? I'm very sorry, but you must be making a mistake. No, quite impossible, dear Lieutenant... I'm not good at remembering names, but am with faces... You've forgotten me. Yes...maybe you're right. Ekberg. Yes, of course... that's it... Lieutenant Ekberg it was! How could I have forgotten it! Sit down. How glad I am that you showed up here. Just due to a mishap... Landed in a rye field some distance away Engine cut out and I had to make a crash-landing. Not the sort of way I like to land. - When the need is greatest, help is close. You don't know just how true that is! I guess we can tuck in then! What is it, darling? It's impossible to sleep in this damned country. It never gets dark. I'll have a brandy. Good idea. It's good for my little Hugo! Come and lie down beside me again. No. I think I'll go out for a while. That'll probably do you good. There's food in the pantry if you feel like it. You do not care who I am! What do you mean by that? I could be anyone at all. Darling...! I can tell that you're dying to get back to sea. Have your brandy and go out for a while. I'd really like to sleep a bit more. Hey, wake me up when you come back... and I'll be nice to you! She-cat! What did you say? I said she-cat! You're an old she-cat who just thrives in this whore-house! A mob of old spongers and twinkletoes You don't give a damn who you share your room with! He looked pretty ferocious! Sure did... Be quiet now! Lola, please let me in! - What's up? - I daren't be alone. Was it your husband who slammed the door? Yes. After you. Well, so this is it. Really nice. I haven't been in here before. Yes... it's not bad at all. What is it? I just wanted to look at you. Well... be my guest. Do you want to be my lover? What? Do you have a comb? No. How silly I am... I have one, of course Shan't you take off... your coat? I'll take it. Want to sit down? Yes, thanks. We should have had something to eat. Yeah. You're not frightened of me, are you? Frightened? No... why would I be? Yes. Why? Anyway, I'm not frightened of you. It's so strange... I not frightened at all. I'm only 17. Really? No man has had me yet. Don't talk like that! Not you! You mustn't say such things. I don't want to hear it. You mustn't think badly of me. I'm not at all a bad girl. But you think I am. I'd rather like to be a bad girl... but I'm just not the right type. As soon as anything happens, I start crying... That makes me ashamed. Do you think I'm awful? Tell me you like me just a little bit! I do like you. I like you an awful lot! Maybe we should get some sleep. Yes. You can sleep there. Thanks, but what about you? Yeah... it'll work out. Do you dare sleep beside me? Yes... if I'm allowed. Valborg! Where the devil are you?! Out of the frying pan into the fire! He's going to kill you! What have you done with Valborg, I haven't seen her. You're lying, you goddamn slut! Such language! You'll wake the whole house! I plan to wake the whole house! Out of the way! I'll have it out with that sea monster. Warrior blood can rise, even in a frail woman's body. I'll show that gorilla that I can fight! So, are you there too, Miss Fristedt? Some sort of women's club meeting? You should be ashamed to disturb two angels in their innocent nest! So you ARE there, you old bitch! Yes, I'm here... God have mercy on you if you dare stick your nose in! If you don't send Valborg out, I'll break down the door! - Valborg's not here. - Where is she, then? We don't know. Goddamn brothel-keepers! I knew that guy would do something crazy in the end. Don't get hysterical! I'll fight! I'll kick him... stomp on him... I'll drink his blood! I'll go find an axe! You'll see! He's chopping the door down! We'll slip up to my room. There's no time! Maybe another room! Who's in that room? Mt Haakansson from the theatre. I think he's with a lady. We can't disturb a good client. What about that one? The boy with the rucksack. But I think he's still out. What's going on here? Stay in your room! A homicidal maniac is on the rampage and will be back any moment! Come on Mr Haakansson, and bring the lady! - Safest if we're together in one room. - Which room? So, you've come back... with company, I see. Pleased to meet you. Sorry to disturb you, but there's a madman in the house. - Who's the madman? - My husband. Really? I wouldn't have believed that of him. Maybe he's just a bit drunk. - Let me take care of him. - Finally a brave man! I know that you're an old soldier. Hello! Haven't we met before, in more pleasant circumstances? How are things in Torrljunga? Fine thanks. I didn't know your husband was like this. Does drinking affect him badly? Maybe I can talk him out of it. No, you don't know him... When he's worked up like this he can be dangerous. Maybe he won't find an axe. An axe!? He mustn't come! What if he's killed himself?! Maybe the gentlemen could go and see what's happened? He's unlikely to do any harm to you. You look so nice, you might calm him down. I'll come with you. Why not ask me? I was at Tammerfors in 1918. That would be too many, and he'd get the wrong idea. Best with the young man and the lady there. Go with our blessing... We'll watch out for you. We're members of the Army Reserve, Mr Haakansson! - Will you recognise him? - Yes... he was in uniform... Off you go... and may God protect you. Mr Snaeckendal... Mr Snaeckendal! Yes? Who are you? What do you want with me? Why are you sitting here? I'll sit here whenever I want. It's my house. Go to bed... go and sleep. You should sleep, too... You don't look well. I can't sleep. Why are you so unhappy? None of your business. Anyway, what makes you think I'm unhappy? I can see it on your face. I guess that's right. What happened here? "Happened?" What happened? Nothing. That's the whole frigging problem! Nothing happened! Life sure isn't easy. So much isn't what it should be. Such as? That's what I'm sitting and pondering over. There's lots to ponder about. Can't we help you? How would that work? I can't do that, until you tell me what it is that's not what it should be. Get off me! What do you want? Are you after something? And who are you? Standing there, saying nothing. Go to blazes! Scram! You're also part of this goddamned whorehouse! Piss off! I'll level this filthy nest of vermin to the ground! Hugo... He's killing her! Oh, my darling... You're just wonderful! That's lovely...! Yes... well then... I guess we should say goodnight.. Or rather, "good morning"! Come on, dear. Listen, I think we could do with a bight to eat and a stiff drink. Agreed? Sounds good to me! Come along then. I think I'm going crazy! So terrifying! Imagine how it would have been if you'd not had a knife! Then the parachute wouldn't have opened, and we'd have never met I'm sorry, but we really have to close now. Close? When we're having such a good time. Well then... I'll pay for myself. No, no! Absolutely not! Please, Lieutenant Ekberg...! You really shouldn't have expenses on my account. No? Really? I'll borrow your pencil, so I can work this out. 27 kronor... Lieutenant Ekberg... Is this disagreeable? Would you feel more comfortable if you...? That's what I've been trying to say the whole time. Then I guess I'll be forced to give in. Thank you very much! Oh, please don't mention it! You should play. The one who has not lost everything he owns on roulette... ...doesn't know what life's about. I know that I don't want to play. You're the careful type. You're anxious about getting good value for everything you lay out. You never get anything out of life if you're always anxious. I don't want to own anything. Really? Wealth is a crime. Poverty is holy. Listen to that! Are you Communist? I'm a Christian. And you? I'm an artist. For us, poverty is a necessity. You must devote your life to your art. So what sort of artist are you? Actress. No! Really? Are you also an actor? No, I'm a writer. Well I never! Here you have a colleague, young man. Have you heard of Rosalind Friesenschoeld? That was my pseudonym, 30 years ago. I wrote novels for prim young ladies who dreamed about the big wide world. No harm done. I wrote about the world they wanted to have... and I made money out of it. It would be interesting to read what you've written. I haven't written anything yet. I've just begun. I'm out studying life and the people. Gathering material. It will be a wonderful book. Here's to your future, honoured colleague! Here's to your future! I'll follow you, wherever you may go! Life belongs to the young. We bitchy old ladies wish you all the best! You speak for yourself! But I join her in wishing for your prosperity. We need to get some sleep. We have to be on our way in the morning. Could we be woken at 9 o'clock 9? Yes, that'll be done. Goodnight and thanks so much! And to you both. I'll give you a word of advice. Whatever you do and wherever you end up... always be honest with yourself. Always be something other than who you are... because we are fake by nature. To be false is to be true. Oh? Thank you. You did not understand that, did you?! You may be stupid, but at least well-mannered. Just you remember, when that happens... Being well-mannered means keeping your cool when you're told something stupid. Irony requires experience... ...lost ideals... ...and a great deal of bitterness. You're a sweet couple. The other comes with the years, along with the beard. The future is yours. That, you can be sure of. No, I don't like youth. "Oh, lovely radiant emptiness..." "...you don't know how to make use of what you have." What nutty old dames they are. Got enough room? Yeah. Careful you don't fall out of bed. Don't worry... go to sleep. Where are we going to tomorrow? As far as the money will take us. You're the most unique person I know. You too. If only you stopped talking! I didn't say any more. No, it's a little guy inside me saying horrible things... when I'm thinking of something beautiful. I call him Homunculus. I don't want to listen to him. What does he say? I can't talk about it. Ridiculous! It's nothing to laugh about. He wants to lead me astray. To do what? Everything possible. Now go to sleep. Are you quite sure I won't be a bother to you? Quite sure. How's Homunculus this morning? Shh! He's still asleep. Hey... what do you want? Don't you want tickets? Yes, we do. Where are you going? Of course... where shall we go? It's not my job to enlighten you about that. How much do you have? About 3 kronor. Could we get 2 tickets for a fiver, all-up? Going north or south? - What do you think? - Well... south. Southwards. A ticket to Loviseborg costs 2.40. Thanks. That'll do us. And 20 cents change. Calm down, its coming. Try a little politeness! Cheeky bitch! - Excuse me... - Oh, please! Excuse me, a wasp is crawling on your hat. It's certainly not bothering me. Thanks for your concern. There's no danger. I'm friends with all creatures. All creatures are our friends. If they harm us, it's only in self-defense. I used to raise bees and they never stung me. A circus tent! No, it's the Pentecostals' tent. A religious circus, so to speak... These days, everything can happen. There's no resistance. Without resistance, everything becomes shallow and brutalised. There's something in what you say. I don't know... I'm a heathen. What? An honest heathen is a better person than a dishonest Christian. You've not found anything to look up to... Yes, I understand you. It's all the same to me. Life is a flea circus. We're all just fleas. I don't want to respect anything. You may have reason to be bitter, I wouldn't know... There are many reasons for it. But you're young... you have to be careful... Bitterness can damage your fresh young outlook. He's an idealist. He's an idealist...?! So, if you feel your ideals are getting soiled... do you get bitter and begin to despise the world? What was the value of your ideal... if it couldn't cope with any resistance. I'm not an idealist. He really is. Forgive me for asking... Where are you going? We don't really know. You don't? So, might one say that... You're out and about to have fun hither and thither? Nothing decided? - No. Splendid! Would you like to come to my place? My name's Johannes Torsleff and I'm a pastor in Vansall. I'm unmarried and my two sisters are my housekeepers. I rarely meet such interesting young people. You're more than welcome! You can stay just as long as you wish. - Yes... thank you. - And you? Thanks. We'll soon be there. I really hope you enjoy yourselves. So this is what it's like. It's delightful! I welcome you both. This is Fritz. Sorry, you don't know him... He's a political adventurer... who has ended up here after a fruitless life. His name is Diebolt. Hello, Fritz. Hello. How was your trip, pastor? Good, thanks. I have these two young people with me. I like young people. Youth... and beauty. For you, Miss. It's beautiful. You like flowers? - I do. - So do I. You can socialise with flowers when you are tired of people. Flowers are always the same. They're never moody and changeable. Their soul is in their colour and shape... and they are always innocent. Wash your hands. It's soon tea time. Welcome home, old boy. I've been sitting here in the sun for three hours... and burned and distilled my thoughts on the nothingness of life. Did the thunderstorm hit town? Your sisters went back to their room. They said they had a headache. So what's new in town, worthy father? Nothing at all. Nothing? How boring. I think I'll get gout. That's another story. I still remain your affectionate adopted son, Ernst Emanuel Viktor.... ...he said, and left. We'll meet again at the tea ritual... with burnt cakes and bitter marmalade. The voluptuous chaste sacrifices on the alter of social life. So long! You must forgive him. He carries with him great bravery an ceaseless suffering. Infantile paralysis has damaged his body. Something is constantly bothering him... but he has a will of iron. Let's go in. There you are... Sugar... and cream. - No thanks. - No cream? Yes, tea should be drunk without cream. Miss Saerner is an actress. Well, what do you know! An actress! How interesting! What sort of an actress? Does your heart belong to the stage, and your stomach to films? I don't dare say vagina. Ernst! We saw a film called "The Vagina's Temptation"... or "The precipice on the edge of the bed." We saw it as a matter of social interest Right? At the same time, it was supposed to be... an enlightening story... abortions on the assembly line. The sexual distress of our time in artistic form. The bed didn't play the starring role... That was... That's enough, Ernst! Disgusting! Yes, I agree... It's disgusting that such things occur! Nowadays we can discuss anything. Just think of our weekly magazines. Bestiality is a social problem... and our magazines must be up with the times. Youth laps it up. We inform the youth about finding each other and happiness between the sheets... ...or on top of them. Yes it even happens on top of them, aunties. You're like a fresh breeze in this stuffy room, Miss Saerner. We are all drowning in righteousness and decency here. We die every day, martyred by our respective ideas. And it is my desire to die every day in every delightful obscenity. That's quite enough! Is it? May I not believe in the nothingness of life? I am and still remain your hopeful adopted son. in your absence of marriage and with your carnal delusions. I withdraw. We'll meet again at the devotional hour of beetroot and pork. unless I'm misinformed by the kitchen. How long shall we have the pleasure of your company? When's the next train to Gustafshamn? About 2 in the morning. We'll take it. I was looking forward to having you here for at least a week. We thought so too. Might I ask where you're going? Where? Life is a journey. We're on our way to death. More pork? No thanks. We die every day of our live. Something inside us is dying every hour. We don't really know which way... we're just tourists. We should learn to know our own country. Yes, of course. You should see around here... we have the most beautiful countryside. But we have few historical monuments. Not even a single small ruin or some old castle. We travel to see people. It's so interesting and instructive seeing different people. Yes, what's a journey... What's a life? A journey of discovery within ourselves. Why don't you say anything? Say something! Careful! He gets mad! - I'm disappointed. - Why? I was hoping you'd say something which cleared the air in this hole. Almighty God, Lord of all lord... you who gave me a house to run... and who every day blesses me with His deeds... let me always remember that all I own on earth is a loan from you. Oh that I should be able to manage it as your faithful servant... so that one day You find me worthy to be put over much more. Amen. Dan, we have to leave right away! Before something happens. That poor pastor that lives here... There are no trains today. I want to go home. What's got into you? I don't know... it's those people... What is it with them? They're so creepy! That Diebolt makes my skin crawl. I'm sure he's a murderer. hiding here from what he's done. I think he's quite nice. But the cripple is a nasty piece of work. Yes, he is. You exaggerate. I don't know... maybe. They're harmless. You're oversensitive and tired. Go and have a nap. Did you see Diebolt's hands? They look like lizards' hands... smooth and cold and insensitive. There is cruelty and vices in them. Why did the pastor bring us here, anyway? I've wondered. That's enough of that, now Pia. Maybe it's just my imagination. I'll try to see Diebolt differently. But be kind to the cripple. Yes, darling! What did you say? I said "yes, darling". You're such a one-off! I felt such a nuisance. I like you so much! I love you. What did you say? Nothing. Come on, we'll go back. I'll wish the both of you a very good night. And remember "If you can't be good, be careful!" "If you can't be careful - remember the fates!" Like to come to my room for a liqueur? I'm a bit tired. A pity. But you might like to sit and talk for a while, Mr Kaellander. Goodnight. If you have no objections? Oh, no. You must have lived an interesting life. Have you moved here? Yes, this is where I'm living. Please go in. Our life... What is it actually? A constant escape... ...from something. From ourselves... From all decisions. A constant move. Pack up and travel... Stay somewhere for a while.... Something happens... What? Something you want to escape. Pack up and travel again... to the next place. That's how my life has been. Imagine always getting to travel... To go abroad! I wish the war was over. You're young... and Swedish. What do you know about, other than tourist trips? There are other journeys, as well. You Swedes just want the war over and done with... so you can go to the cafes in Paris... and sunbathe on the beaches of the Riviera. Good God! Do you really not comprehend just what is going on out there? Everything you live for and believe in... ...will soon no longer be there. It's dying on the battlefield. Your morality... your decency... your gullibility... ...are currently fighting in their death struggle. And things that are holy to you.. justice, order, reason... ...no longer exist. But it's true... you've shown it... You're different. That's why you don't understand what's happening. You think it will all disappear like a bad dream. But that won't happen. You think you'll wake up one fine morning, and everything will be as before. But it won't. Because all that is dying at this moment. In fact, it is already dead. Yes, but... I'm sorry, my young friend... I wasn't trying to frighten you. But the good... the good in people, must win in the end. You believe that? That's not just a devout wish? We so easily confuse any possibilities on hand, with our hopes. Our desires have no connection at all with the reality of their fulfillment. I do believe there exists something called "the good." Yes, of course... I think so too. But it's so fragile and brittle. So fragile and brittle. In the world that's now being created... what is happening is... the "good" is being trampled into the dust... ...drenched in blood sweat and tears. All those who... in the name of human justice and dignity... fight violence and power... ...what means do they use, do you think? "Goodness"? No. The only thing that will win... is the triumph of violence over violence. Violence always wins. It's the strongest and most aggressive who win. I think you're wrong. You can't plunder, ravage and kill, endlessly. There are also constructive life-supporting forces. Quite right. But they only exist in the extent they can be turned into money. Profit for them. When they become too powerful... violence ensues... and everything is destroyed again. What do you believe in? Believe? I don't believe in anything. Although... I do believe there are good and sensible people who are destroyed... Beautiful and wonderful things devastated. I do have a modicum of sentimentality. For example, I'm fond of flowers, children and animals. I like them because they are transient... doomed to soon disappear... ...transform, perish. The good and the beautiful are doomed to be trampled and die. What do you think of my liqueur? I'm no judge, but it tastes good. Did you make it yourself? Yes, and I'm quite proud of it. How can you be proud of a liqueur, when you...? Wait...! That's what you learn eventually. I don't despise the good things in life. I don't believe you're right... I don't want to believe it! That's up to you. Hang on to your illusions. You'll eventually lose them. Cheers! Goodnight, Mr Diebolt. Pia... Are you awake? What are you doing here? I didn't mean to wake you. Don't be angry with me. Why are you sitting here? I don't want to do anything to you. You mustn't think badly of me. I just want to sit quietly and look at you.. You're so beautiful. You see... No, you probably wouldn't see. Would you please leave? Miss Saener... Just let me explain. There's no need for you to be afraid of me! I can't pretend, with you. I know it sounds crazy, but... I'm not who I seem to be. Oh, you're not? No. We humans, we... We go around, pretending... We pretend so as to hide our true selves... our pitifulness. Our face is just a mask. In my case at least. I can't stand pity, sentimentality, convention. I hate them! So I have this cynical banter... so that no one should realise how much... ...I'm suffering. I hate saying this. Poor thing. Not that way. I only want that you should understand me. I do not want any pity! Why are you hiding the fact that you're a good person? I'm a very bad person. I'm a phoney and a hypocrite. I want people to believe that of me. I love to scare and shock. It's amusing. I get a kick out of it. I don't want you to believe that I'm a cynical, heartless idiot. I don't. Quite the opposite. I know it sounds silly... ...but I'm happy that YOU understand that. May I kiss your hand? Forgive me... Of course. Come in. It's past 3 o'clock. Are you never getting up? Darling, it's just a few hours since you left. Come here! Come on! Do I get a kiss? Know what I am? Hungry? Goodness me...! I'm happy! Happy that you crash-landed. I just wish that old crate of yours never gets fixed. It probably will be, regardless. Isn't it tedious, sitting alone up there in the barracks? Yes it can be. When you have to stay grounded, it gets boring of course. Time probably passes faster for your married colleagues That may be true! Butt I've no desire to change. No? I've no desire for a wife and kids around my neck. I prefer the odd crash-landing. They may not have the same pleasant outcome as this one. Perhaps not. Better luck next time, then! Up you get now! Know what I am? What are you? - An idiot. - Why? Why is so easy to catch a man... and so hopelessly difficult to hang on to him? Yes, well... Be happy for that... you're not cut out for marriage. I'll wait for you in the hall. What would you like? - We're here for lunch. - Lunch is finished. Dinner then. Sorry, too early for dinner. Here is our a la carte. - How much do we have? - About 5. All up? We're so hungry, maybe we could just get some buttered toast. - And cheese! - One cheese. - That'll probably be 3 kronor. - We'll manage somehow. At least we're away from that rectory. It was such a wonderful place. The priest was a good guy. But that Diebolt was pretty weird. And the cripple was horrible. I believe that deep down, he was an unhappy person. - I know... - What? I know I feel sorry for him. I think we misunderstood him. No... but Pia! Where have you been? Your dad has raised heaven and earth. He's really in despair. Why would he be like that? He can sometimes be like a mother hen. That's not nice of you! Maybe you can introduce us? Lieutenant Ekberg - Miss Saerner. - And Mr...? - Kaellander. - Can we join you? - Yes, love you to! Are you in the navy, Lieutenant? Navy? No... the air-force. I've always dreamed of meeting a flier! There's something very special about such men. I really don't know about that... Don't you think there's something special about him? I don't think so, Pia. He seems just like most guys... More's the pity. I don't believe it. I'm quite convinced that there's something very special about him... even if you disagree. Excuse me. Mr Kaellander! What made him rush off? Well, you weren't very nice to him. Not nice? What did I do? You shouldn't treat him like that. He's too good for you. I resent being reprimanded as if I were a child. You do? Please! I can take care of myself. I'm not so sure. Telephone for Lieutenant Ekberg. Forgive me. You're behaving like a spoiled kid, Pia, my pet. You have to think first, and be prudent. Just because I didn't stop him from leaving? Big deal! You know very well that's not what I meant. Your flirting with Lt Ekberg was in very poor taste. Did it make you jealous? No, Pia, my pet, I'm not a child. I haven't promised Dan... Mr Kaellander, anything. Maybe not. But he's in love with you. How can you know that? It's not hard to tell. Would you like advice from an experienced woman? No thanks. I'll give it to you anyway. Cherish his love... even if it lapses. You don't realise until afterwards how much you lose. You may never have it again, from anyone. I know best what I'm doing! What would you know? I'm old enough to know what I want! I have to shoot off... The plane is fixed and the bus leaves in a few minutes. Goodbye to you, It's been lovely! If you're in my area, get in touch. Just phone the squadron at the base. 'Bye! Pia pet, what are you doing here? I'm looking for Dan... He's gone. - Are you traveling? - Yes, I finally got some money sent. My husband did the right thing. Marie, forgive me for being so stupid. Oh, forget it. - What if I never see him again? - Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find him. And don't forget, if you find him, don't let him go. Once I was young and thoughtless like you... I've regretted it ever since. You learn to realise, even if it sounds banal... to value what you have... You never know how you might end up. All aboard! Take care of yourself... and of him! Hey you... kid! Come here a moment. - What is it? - Just come here. Don't be afraid... there's no danger. What is it? Like to earn a couple of kronor? Yeah... Doing what? You just need to stand here and see that nobody unauthorised comes on board. How do I know if they're unauthorised? Well, for that matter... it's best you don't let anyone at all in. How long do I stay? Until I get back, of course. I just need to have a few words with a chick. - How long will that take? - Maybe an hour. What is some cop comes by? It won't happen.. there's no one here. 'Bye! Dan! - Dan, what are you doing here? - Standing watch. Why did you run off? Were you finished with me? I'll never forgive you... why did you have to do that? You aren't mad at me, are you? No... It was just that... that flier... I didn't like the way you were talking to him. You sounded as if you wanted to be free of me. You idiot... what sort of nonsense is that? What are you doing here? Standing watch. I get 2 kronor for it. The guy said he's be back in an hour. I'm freezing. Can't we wait somewhere else? I can't... I'm standing watch. You find somewhere and I'll fetch you later. Can't you come with me? Get in the boat. It looks exciting! I've never been in a bat like this. I'm so glad I found you! You mustn't do that to me... Promise you won't run off again.! I promise. I've been so miserable! I'd better go back in case he comes. But don't abandon me again! No, I promise. I don't trust you. You just rush off when things are difficult. So go away! Yes, I know... It's just not easy for me to accept something like that. - It's not? - No. There's not just one of me... There's two. It's so tangled up and complicated. There are two. One is stupid, and says things without meaning them and acts the opposite and is obsessive. He's as dumb as they come and as stubborn as a clodhopper. It's he who gets angry and shouts when little Pia flirts with fliers. But there's another one of me... who suffers... who looks... and thinks about it... afterwards... when it's too late. And he has sad, kind eyes. And on his back he has wings. He soars high above the earth... higher than any aviator. He's the one I love... Because that is Dan. Pia! Dan... Listen... I must go outside now. Lie down and rest and I'll soon be back. It should be a pleasant rest...! Wait and see. What are you going to do? Find you a mattress. It'll just take a second. This looks good... fibre stuffing will be comfortable. Pia, come here... - Look at this. - What is it? Look...! - What is it? - A tommy gun. A what? Sub-machine gun, 54 shots in 4 seconds. How horrible! What's it doing here? Don't you see what it means? They're gun-runners. Ssh! There's someone up there. Come on! Hi. What a bloody business! Woken in the middle of the night! Make sure you get some speed out of it! The guy from the boarding house! Which one? Snackendal. And no watch in sight. Hey! Johansson! No one is to go ashore.. And no one without ID comes aboard! There's moonlight. What shall we do? - We'll go down and think about it. - What? We'll go down and think about it. What do you want me to say? Woken in the middle of the night, without any notice... With just 7 men! 7 men! What is this trip? Obey orders and do your job! What do you mean? I've no idea as to what's going on. Don't ask questions. All very weird... damned weird! Well, I'll be damned... it's you! With female company! How did you get here? - Same as you. Are you employed here? - Yes. Were you a seaman? Seaman? No, I'm an inventor. A nicer word than author or performer. For such a person, nothing must be untried. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. I'm still at your service! A magnanimous louse? A noble tapeworm? Exactly. Thanks for before! What's the cargo? I told you I wanted no questions! Haven't you been paid? Oh yes... Paid far to well. That's what bothers me. Look at this! What do you say about that? Hey... how about that! A little pop-gun! Careful! It shoots 54 shots in 4 seconds Did you see my note? About what? "You owe me nothing, Sextus, not one penny." That's a translation, but it's pretty close. Enough of that, we have to do something! Do what? What's that? They're staring the engines. The boat's moving! Where are we going? Don't ask. I don't like it all, not knowing! Listen, you... You're a bit too inquisitive. I advise you to be more careful. I see... So that's how it is? Yes. Aha... so here we are... - May I come in? - What about? Sorry to disturb you like this! The radio working alright? What? Working? I mean, it's going alright... It's functioning as it should? Who the devil are you? What are you doing here? I wanted to send a message... No private messages are allowed here! Don't bother me! Get out of here! Can't be an easy job, being a radio operator! Complicated gear... Buttons... switches... and knobs... Is the radio working? What the devil has it got to do with you?! If something should happen... Happen? What could happen? There's a lot that can... happen... at sea. Are you scared? Yes, you could say that. Well, if it'll calm you down... the radio is working. Well... in that case... How heavy this guy is... It would be a lot easier if radio operators were smaller. Where's Andersson? Andersson? He wasn't feeling well, so he went outside. Oh. Hurry up! It's done. I quite impressed myself. Come on! You stay here. Do as I tell you... Stay here and keep quiet! Come on! Where's the switch? We have to send a message! We have to get the transmitter going first. Well, what have we here!? My young friend who believes in the good in people. How has he got here? Don't touch the radio! That could make things unpleasant. Hello there! Come here! Take care of these gentlemen. Make sure they're securely locked up. I should have realised who you were! There you see the danger of believing illusions. I did warn you. Where's that young lady of yours? We split up. Really? Take him away. Mate, have the ship searched. A young lady may be hiding somewhere. Johansson, rouse the helmsman. I'll hold the wheel. What's our speed? 6 knots. The course? West sou' sou' west. Shall we make it, that way? There's always risk. Let me know if anything happens... Right away. Yes, Mr Diebolt. Hello there... now you're caught! Let me go! Is it YOU?! Don't talk... You seem a decent guy... You can't know what's going on here. What are you raving about? What are you doing here? Do you know what the cargo is? No. - I'll show you. - No, don't try any tricks! How about this? 54 shots in 4 seconds. No! What the hell...! Take it easy, kid...! First mate Snackendal will sort this out. Yes, I had my suspicions... Trust me, Miss! They'll be dancing to a different tune! We have one hope... Snackendal. I think he's straight. He'll sort all this out. Damnation...! One more and we can play bridge! Now we've lost hope. More likely we've found it. Just help me bring the guy round! It's one out of the way. Maybe he can help us if he's conscious. Sea voyages are supposed to be healthy and good for the nerves. I have to doubt it. Hands up! Now! Not a word! One move and you're as dead as a doornail. Don't move! Turn... Turn around. We'll go to the wheelhouse. Don't try anything, or I'll shoot you immediately! Hurry up! Open the door... silently. Hands up! This shoots 50 rounds in 4 seconds. My finger's on the trigger! If I move my finger, you'll be Swiss cheese! Go to that door... now! Go in... Don't try any funny business! Shut the door! I'll be keeping watch. If I hear the least sound... No, that didn't work out! You're much too young to be playing with this. Nice to see you anyway. So interesting to meet you again... and in circumstances like this. This is not for young ladies. Dan! No use trying... I know that trick. You make out there's someone behind me... so that I turn with my back to you... and then you attack me. Sorry, my girl, but that trick is as old as the hills. Need to try something new! Oh, Dan! Darling Pia! How did you go? I stuck this in a guy's back... and threatened him with 50 shots in 4 seconds.. and then I stuck the other guys in there. Weren't you scared? Yes, but they were the most scared. Open up! Quiet! Is this what you threatened them with? - That's right! - This gun? But Pia... it's not loaded. Really...? It's not loaded? There's not a single round in it. They won't let Diebolt out for at least 15 years. Let's hope so, anyway. How did you get out? A beard... man's most beautiful ornament! We fixed it, my girl... nice and tidy and respectable. He was fantastic.. He tricked one of the crew to the doorway. Then he pretended that Snackendal was bleeding. You should have heard him. It was a real actor's performance. "Do you want his life on your conscience or mine?"! In the end this guy came in... Then we gave in to him. - How fantastic! - It was crazy. You can write a book about it! No, I couldn't do that. Why not? I don't want to disappoint my readers. I may not be the brightest star... but there are some that believe in my talent. I do, completely! Well, thank you, young lady. Don't you feel it's bedtime? You go to bed, if you're tired. I'd like to chat for a bit. Really? Goodnight then. Goodnight. Pleasant dreams. Are you planning to keep the boy in tow? Don't put him down! I wasn't putting him down. You could get anyone. He's not the right type for you. So what's the right type for me? He's be a man of the world... comfortably off... Could teach you things. Well, Dan has taught me a lot. Such as? He has great experience of his inner self... If you know what I mean. He's suffered so much. Hail to the wee tot! How old is he? 19. Just a tiddler! You're a supercilious egotist! Sounds right. - What? - Yes... An unbearable supercilious egotist! Who's a little bit in love with you. You? Yeah... You're such a lovely mixture... "Mixture"? A lovely composite of every type of woman. Composite?! The nice thing about you... is that nothing about you has become fixed yet. You're a small bouquet... full of promise. You just sit there toying with your little charm-tricks... But you're still supercilious and horrible! Yes... But isn't it fascinating? Yes. Hail to the wee tot! What the hell was that for? It's my answer. You look amazing right now! God, you're awful! Did I hurt you? Forgive me. I thank you for the slap. You do? You're better than I thought. It's a wonderful feeling to discover it. Hail to the wee tot! You're actually worth that chap. "Worth"? Be nice to him. He's a wonderful person. Whatever you might think of him, he has something extra. You're nothing compared to him. I totally agree with you. Now you should go... Go up to bed... and say goodnight to Dan before you fall asleep. Yes, I must admit I'm a little tired. Thanks for this evening. Thanks, yourself. Don't forget to say goodnight. Dan! Yes? I just wanted to say goodnight. Goodnight. He really doesn't mean anything at all to me. Who? You know very well! I thought of something funny. What was that? I saw you sitting, lost in thought... and Homunculus buzzing around you like a blowfly. May I come in? What do you want? I was thinking of scaring Homunculus away. How would you manage that? I was thinking of coming to you. May I? Do you want me to leave? Shouldn't you try to get some sleep? I can't. Wouldn't it be better if you stayed there? Where's that damn Homunculus? I'll lie there quite still. No, Pia! No! I'll just sit here for a while. You've made me into something quite different. Something quite different to what I really am. I've not been myself at all, since I met you.. I don't know what's happened to me! Pia... Come here! I'm always making you unhappy. It's so strange... I don't do for anyone else what I do for you. I don't know why, you know. I'm not myself, with you. I'm someone quite different. It's just as well... that I love you Pia! I'm yours. And I’m yours. Good morning! Good morning. The bill's made out. I'll take care of that. So... where are you off to? We don't really know. Maybe to Charlottendal. Goodbye... Thanks for everything. I hope we meet again! Under quieter and more normal circumstances. Good luck! Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Youth... ...loves youth! So a great author once wrote. Yes, it's right, about youth! It was good... In fact it was... very good. I liked those two, doorman. Yes, I can understand. I hope things work out for them. Guardian angels get tired too. They are no more than angels. No... that's quite right. Hello... yes? City Hotel... Gustafshamn. Hello.... a young lady? Yes. Blue-eyed... petite... Forelocks? Yes... Saerner? Yes, that's right... Wait... She left an hour ago in the opposite direction to Charlottendal. Youth, sir... think about it. Of course! Miss Saerner stayed here last night. But she left over an hour ago. I an easterly direction. Towards Stockholm. Yes... That's quite alright. Don't mention it. Thank you. Thank you, sir! You've done a good deed. Your good deed for the day. Youth needs room to manoeuvre... a head start. Yes... I understand. Sometimes we're obliged to help providence. Yes... that's very true. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. What are you thinking about? What will become of us? Phooey! Don't think about it. Let's just be happy and joyful. Look at the moon! What does it make you think of? I'm thinking of what I wanted, on that night when I met you. What did you want. I wanted to be free... but whatever happened... that my life should change. And then I met you. Thanks, little moon! It's given us so much. So much we've experienced since we met. More with every moon. It feels like we've been together for a year at least. Agree? Yes. How did you wish? You promised to tell when your wish came true. Did it happen? Yes, it was fulfilled. Where? When? How? Last night. Thank you, good moon! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG.
