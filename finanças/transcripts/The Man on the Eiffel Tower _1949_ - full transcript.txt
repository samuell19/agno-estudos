Will you take this? And I am sick of it. How much longer is this going to go on? I don't know how to do anything else. Then you'd better learn and you'd better make some money somehow. I will. I will. When? That's what I want to know. When? You'll see. I'll find a way. Maybe today. Good day, Mr Kirby. - Hello. Is my wife here? Yes. Over there with your little blonde. Hello darling. Bill. Sorry I'm late. I got held up. - Not by business you didn't. I didn't get a job suddenly if that's what you mean. I'm too old for that sort of thing. As a matter of fact I waited for somebody who didn't come. Hello Edna. Where did you two meet up this afternoon? I called her and invited her. You don't mind, do you? After all, we've known each other for years. In fact I'll become a friend of the family if I'm not careful. There. You have gotten her to talk. That's wonderful. She's sat absorbed in that paper since she got here. If you want to know what is happening in the world, ask her. What is happening in the world, Edna? Well, here is a man who robbed a woman. He got twenty-two francs. It happens every day. - Yes. But he murdered her too. That's a poor return on his investment. When they let him go send him around to me. If he can get rid of my aunt I'll give him a million francs. Bill. Don't say you answered 'no' again? Yes. And very firmly. Has he told you about Mrs Henderson? I took the liberty, sir. Thank you. A Martini, sir. For you. - Thanks. Everything alright otherwise? What is Mrs Henderson going to do with all her money? She's going to give it to me. Then why worry? She may live to be a hundred. That's too long. I'll get rid of her for you. For a million francs? Just for love. Did you cut yourself, madam? - No. Bill. Why don't you tell her now, this minute? Yes. Tell me, darling. Don't you think this is rather an odd place to discuss a personal matter? You don't have to shout it out. Just say it soft and distinctly. Helen. Edna and I. Edna and you think you love each other. Is that it? Yes. I am afraid that's it. And. You would like me to step out of the picture? Not at all, darling. You stay where you are. We'll step out. How thoughtful. I didn't want it to happen this way. You can do what you like, Bill. As long as you pay. Meaning what? Meaning she will let you go if you give her money. I mean that and a good deal more, my pet. We live entirely on credit, Bill and I. You must have guessed it by now. You must have guessed how everything revolves around that aunt of his dying. And if she takes too long, well .. He'll get tired of waiting and .. Poor Bill. Well. I'll get along now. I guess you two have quite a lot to think about. Yes. And .. In the meantime, Edna. You'd better just go on being a friend of the family, huh? Goodbye. Bye. You know, Helen took it nicely. Nicely? What is so nice about demanding a fortune you haven't got? I'll get it somehow. I love you, Bill. I really do. But Helen was right about one thing. If you don't do something soon I can't wait. You understand that, don't you? I understand only one thing. I can't lose and I won't lose you. Did you drop this, sir? I don't think so. Yes. I guess I did. You want another drink? No thanks. Mind if I go? No. If you must, you must. Playing against yourself? I just want to see if I can throw two aces. And if you do? The answer will be yes. - Yes to what? Nothing important. Just an idea. Goodbye, darling. Bye. My glasses. I can't see. No. No. I can't see. What happened? - She said someone killed her. Killed who? - The old lady. Look at my hands. - You idiot. We planned a nice simple robbery. A chance to get you some money. Look what you've done. - I didn't do it. You think the police will believe that? You'll wind up on the guillotine. Don't let them do that. Alright. I'll make a bargain with you. Keep your mouth shut about my being here and I'll get you out of this mess. How? Let them catch you and then just sit tight. I'll get you out of prison. I'll have a hiding place waiting. I'll never let that knife fall. I don't know you. How can I trust you? - What else can you do? I am your only hope. Come on. I'll take you home. Edna. Why did you want to meet me here? There's no reason for you to be involved in this. Did you hire that knife grinder? The police might think so. They can make it awkward for us. Bill, don't be so serious. I know this is just luck. And now you're rich and you can pay Helen off and you and I can .. What will we do first? It's not as easy as that, darling. You see. There is the will and I suppose a decent period of mourning. And Helen of course. She has certain ideas. We'll have to be careful for a while. - How long? Just be patient, darling. Look. I've got to meet Helen now. - Helen. Always Helen. It won't be long, darling. Wow. He might as well left his name and address. Who is that? - It's the Kirbys. That will be enough. Yes? Mister and Mrs Kirby? Yes. Inspector Maigret. Police Judiciaire. Mr Kirby, are you your aunt's heir? I believe so. Yes. Do you happen to know of anyone who might have wanted to kill your aunt? No-one. No. From what we have been told it was the work of a burglar. It was the work of a burglar, Mrs Kirby, who took nothing. Except two lives. Good day. Joseph. Why not look where you're going? - What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Except you. Here. Let me have it. You were going to do big things. Now you can't even afford to buy yourself a new pair of glasses. I'll get some. - What with? I'm wasting my time. Why do you look behind you all the time? You can't see anything. I was thinking. I still don't know how you lost your glasses. I told you. I fell down. - In the small hours of the night? Where did you fall down? - In a street. What street? - I don't know. You don't know anything. I'll put it away. You find your own way upstairs. Hey, you. Come on down here. Who are you? - I am the police. Police? Your name is Joseph Heurtin? I arrest you for the murders of Juliet Henderson and Elsie Cardeaux. I didn't do it. - You come along with me. Yes. Right now. - What do I say to her? Come along. - Help me. I can't see. Yes, I know. I found your glasses. Now where are you going? - I'm going with this man. With him? Why? - I found his glasses. He found my glasses. - You be careful. Take him to headquarters. Howe did you find your way back from St. Cloud without a pair of these? I didn't kill anybody. Who gave you Mrs Henderson's address? - I didn't kill anybody. Why won't you speak out? I've told you everything. You said your broke into the house to rob Mrs Henderson. When you got there she was laying in a pool of blood. Somebody stepped on your glasses. - I didn't see who it was. How did you find your way back from St. Cloud without your glasses? You know what will happen to you. Don't you? Guard. Who was your accomplice? - I haven't got one. I'm sorry if my nagging got you into this trouble. That didn't have anything to do with it. - Didn't it make you try to steal? Maybe. But that is all it did. You didn't kill her, did you? - No. Then who did kill her? I didn't see who it was. There must have been someone with you. Someone who helped you home. Who was it? I can't tell. If you won't tell. Then it was you that did it. You alone. Guard. Just before the knife fell he started whining for his mother. I begin to feel sorry I listened to you, Maigret. Supposing he slips through your fingers? - I'll see you tomorrow, Mr Comelieu. And remember. I take no responsibility for this. You realize your career is at stake. And a man's head. Yes? Dufoe and Janvier are following him. Right. Is the canteen open yet? When it opens send me up some breakfast. If he stays here, get a room near his. I'll phone Maigret at the BelleVue. Paper, paper! Get your afternoon paper. Give me them all. Latest edition. Paper, paper. Get your afternoon paper. Latest edition. Is he still sleeping? Yes. Where are the papers? Here they are. What do the morning papers say about the escape? Only that he got away. Janvier. Are you sure he didn't try to leave a note anywhere? Positive. We never took our eyes off him. Did he seem to be looking for someone? - If he was, he didn't find him. What about .. What? Yes. - What's the matter? Listen to this letter printed in The Sifflet. 'A semi-official announcement was made in this morning's paper'. 'That Joseph Heurtin, awaiting trial for murder at the Seine Assizes'. 'Escaped from prison under inexplicable circumstances'. 'We are in a position to state'. 'That Joseph Heurtin did not escape. He was made to escape'. 'We can't give the details of the odious comedy that was played out last night'. 'We can say it was the police themselves who presided over this pseudo-escape'. How could anyone know about that? - It's not in here. Not in here. - Nothing here. Lucas. Run down to the office of the Sifflet. I want the original of this letter. Right. We've caught something. I wonder what sort of an animal we've caught. He has gotten up. He is leaving the room. Come along outside but don't make a noise. If he reads that, we're cooked. You go and get it. Excuse me. That is my paper. Get him at the bridge. This is what I was afraid would happen. What I thought would happen. It's what has happened. How is Janvier? I heard about it. Did you think he would die? My wife said .. - He may have been killed. I'm sorry it had to happen. - I'm sorry the whole thing happened. Every paper in Paris screams for an investigation. I've had thirty phone calls since I came in. You think I haven't got superiors too? What are they getting? Phone calls. If I don't lay my hands on the murderer in ten days I'll hand in my resignation. I'm afraid I will accept. - Of course. In other words, if you don't lay hands on Heurtin .. Lay hands on the murderer. - Alright. Let's leave it at that. If there hadn't been a leak I'd say take your time. This is driving me out of my mind. If you find something let me know. - That may be sooner than you think. Have you a lead? I have this piece of paper. Where did you get it? - From the editor of the Sifflet. Look at that. Too bad it's been handled by so many. No sense in looking for fingerprints. What does it tell you? - Not a thing. What about you? I've studied it half the night. The paper comes from The 2 Magots. Do you know the place? Yes. I know the place. The writing was done with the left hand. Not by a left-handed person. But by someone who knows all left-handed writing looks alike. Intellectual. What was that? - Intellectual. The kind that does speak and write several different languages. If I'm going to give you a portrait of him, it is not strictly scientific. You go on. Unless I'm mistaken we're dealing with an extraordinary individual. It is strange. I find here a curious mixture of willpower and .. Weakness the coldness and the emotional capacity. A man's writing? Yes, but I find traits here that are definitely feminine. Of course, I know this would not be very convincing for a magistrate. Just the same. I could have told you much more if he'd written with his right hand. There are stains on the paper though they might have come from the Linotype. But that spot there. That .. Is coffee. In other words, this letter was written .. Yesterday in the bar of The 2 Magots by a polyglot customer drinking coffee. And had probably just committed a very rash act. It's not exactly the sort I expected. - You think it's Heurtin's accomplice? Tell me. What do you do when a girl writes you a love letter? Oh, I never would read it. It would tell me far too much about her. Besides, I've never received one anyway. What will it be? - Beer. I'm glad to see you've stopped mourning. I am still pretty sad. It looks like I'll lose my man as soon as the will is probated. 'I weep for you, the walrus says'. 'I deeply sympathise'. With sighs and tears she scratched out both her eyes. What's the matter, Bill? Inspector. Do you drop in here often? I smoke a pipe. Have a drink. - I've got one. I don't think I noticed you here before. By the way. Are all those rumours true? - What rumours? You know, that murder. That is nothing to worry about. That's a pretty girl with your wife. Yes. She is very pretty. She's not French, is she? No. American. Her name is Edna Warren. Charming. Yes. You'll excuse me, Inspector. Let's go. Taxi. Coffee and yoghurt. 55 Francs. Excuse me. Bring me some caviar sandwiches. Caviar sandwich. One. Three. Three caviar sandwiches. Three. And some vodka too? Yes. Some vodka too. And some American cigarettes. Just a moment. Your check. 300 for the caviar sandwiches. 40 Francs for vodka. 200 cigarettes. I'll pay you tomorrow. You'll have to speak to the manager about then. Hey, Bob. He wants to come back tomorrow to pay his check. He's had caviar sandwiches, vodka .. - That is right. You have no money? - Enough for the yoghurt and coffee. Do you live in this neighborhood? - I have no money at all. Yet you order caviar. George, get a policeman. You're sure you have no money? I think that's what I said. Hurry up. Hurry up. Is this the one? - Yes. He orders caviar, vodka, expensive cigarettes. And refuses to pay. - I have no money. Alright. Come along. You work in this neighbourhood? What's up? A Mr Radek has been brought before you. I want to hear what he has to say. What has he done? - Eaten caviar. Then couldn't pay. Only that? - The circumstances were odd. Where did he do it? - The 2 Magots. Send in Radek. What about this Heurtin business? You're mixed up in it, aren't you? The papers should let us do our own worrying. I am with you there. You know what you're charged with? What have you to say? Nothing at all. - Where do you live? Have you any means of support? You're liable to get 15 days for that. - The sentence would be suspended. You'd have to say it's a first offence. 'Name: Johann Radek. Age 38. Born in Brunn. Father unknown'. Has lived in Berlin, Bonn and Hamburg. A medical student. Is that right? Professor Grollet will tell you I was his best pupil. 'Mother: Elisabeth Radek'. 'Died two years ago. Employed as domestic servant'. How do you live? I knew you were a policeman. - How do you live? While she was alive my mother sent me enough money to study medicine. Out of her wages as a servant? I was her only son. She would do anything for me. Does that surprise you? That was two years ago. Since then? Some relatives send me money from time to time. Once in a while I get some translating to do. What about .. The editor of the Sifflet? I am afraid I don't understand. That's enough. - Take him out. Keep him here tonight. Let him go in the morning. I'll send a young fellow to follow him. Name of Janvier. Check this passport. I don't like the look of that. Alright. What is this about the Sifflet? - I don't know yet. It's that inspector about Radek. - Oh yes. Delighted, Inspector. What can I do for you this beautiful morning? A simple matter, Professor Grollet. I want some information about an ex-student called Johann Radek. 'Uncanny', Inspector. That's what's wrong with that young man. Uncanny. Radek. Mind you, very intelligent. Too intelligent in point of fact. Was he a good student? He has a remarkable flair, Inspector. For sensing the weakness of others. His fellow students were afraid of him. Come to think of it, so was I. He could look at you for a moment and know everything that's wrong with you. He'd meet a man, any man. Or a woman. And he would say to them with delight. 'You will be dead within a year'. And believe it or not, within a year they are gone. A sinister gift, Inspector. I could have made a great doctor of him but he was unbalanced. You know what I mean? One moment burning with excitement. The next deflated. I beg your pardon? Well, out. Yes. Like a match. A sick man, Inspector. What we call a 'manic depressive'. Oh .. manic. His gift for diagnosis wasn't only medical but moral too. Not only here, Inspector. But here as well. I would not want a gift like that. Dear me, no. Thank you very much, Professor. Open up. Open up! He told me to come here. Oh? My son. Follow me. You escaped, didn't you? Yes. Like you said. I saved your life. Why didn't you come here as I told you? - They were following me. Why did you show yourself near the caf?? - I didn't think. I am sick of helping you. It's better that you be dead. - I'll do anything you say. Then stay here until I come to get you. Don't show yourself. If the police get you, they'll tie your hands behind you and cut your head off. Do you want that? - No. You can help a man just so long. After that, he's on his own. Remember. Stay here. Pardon me. Are those francs ready yet? - Just counting them, sir. I'll be right back. Bill, darling. You look lovely. I'm fed up with it. I'm running away tonight. Tomorrow I .. - You won't go anywhere without me. I won't put up with her sarcasm. Her nasty .. Stay until I can go with you. Don't be an idiot. How long will it be? First, it's money. Then .. Darling, things are nearly right. It won't be long now. Believe me. Shush. Look out. Do you know why I like you, Edna? Because you are the least subtle creature I know. I don't have to be subtle, dear. Here you are, sir. - Thank you. Did you want to see me? - Not unless you know a man named Radek. Radek? Radek? - Yes. That is right. I honestly never heard of him. Why? - I just thought you might know him. No. But you can ask .. Hello. Did either of you ever hear of a man called .. What is it, Inspector? Johann Radek. Does he live here in the hotel? He should be handsome with that name. Perhaps you know him, darling? - I know very few people. Forgive us. We're off to a charity ball and we're late already. Bye. Yes, sir? You gave that man some money. I want the numbers of the notes. I'm afraid, sir, that we cannot .. Very good, sir. I just want the numbers of the notes. K423. 71181. 71191. Radek is inside. - Has he been here long? Not very long. But he's had seven yoghurts. Does that make you feel hungry? - No. Just the other way around. Ah, Inspector. Isn't it time we had a talk? I've thought a great deal about you. - I am all ears. I am sure you are. But not here. Why not here? - I'll take my patronage elsewhere. This morning when I came in they expected me to pay in advance. Did you? Yes. Things like that leave a bad taste in one's mouth. Do you know the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower? No. I go to the tower every day. Now perhaps the two of us can go. Shall we have lunch together? Caviar sandwiches and vodka? Agreeable? After you, Inspector. Taxi. Taxi. Keep the change. It gives one a feeling of power. Like watching an anthill. Don't you ever wonder how it feels to fall from so high up? A man of courage could find out. What a brilliant gesture of contempt for human weakness. If life becomes completely humiliating I recommend a leap from the top. As an excellent means of leaving this best of all possible worlds. But not until after we've had lunch. Your health, Inspector. Don't think for a moment I'm throwing doubt on your professional capacity. If, in this case you understand less than nothing. It's only because from the start you have worked on falsified data. And having gotten on the wrong track. Everything was inevitably wrong. And everything you'll find out will be wrong. Right to the very end. You can't make out what I'm up to. It looks like I were trying to put my head under the guillotine. Here I am talking of the very subject about which you're dying to involve me. But how can I be brought into it? I've nothing to do with these people. The most to be said against me is that yesterday .. Joseph Heurtin wandered around The 2 Magots seeming to look for me. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn't. The fact remains that I left the place accompanied by a couple of policemen. And what does that prove? You made a mistake letting Heurtin go before you got a conviction. You may not get anyone else to take his place. There's always the possibility he'll get completely away. Then you would be stuck. Wouldn't you? Shall I .. Help you, Inspector? Shall I? Give you the pretext you need in order to arrest me. There. 100,000 francs. Brand new notes. Easily traced. Have a good time. Trace them. Or would you prefer to arrest me? Or perhaps best of all, wouldn't you like to start all over again? At the Henderson house? That's what I'd do if I were you and just heard what you heard. I think I'd go out there this afternoon and go over those false tracks again. Who knows what I might find? Listen, son. I will start all over again. I might find out how long ago .. You came into the picture. Hello? Hell Mr Kirby. This is your friend. What do you want? I've heard the police are reopening the investigation into your aunt's death. Yes. Starting tomorrow. They're going over the house again with a fine-toothed comb. And this time they will find the knife. I left it there somewhere. Where? Where? No. I can't remember where. But it has my fingerprints on it. When they find it, it will lead them directly to me. Then from me to you. You will have to get it. Me? I can't. Yes. Go out there this afternoon. Now. It's the last chance you'll have. It's your neck, Mr Kirby. Who was that? It was Helen, wasn't it? Bill. What did she say? What's she trying to do now? Nothing. It wasn't her. - Bill. Whatever she said. Whatever you want to do, don't do it. I can handle her. Bill. 'K42371'. '42371'. Souvenirs? Postcards? I don't want anything. 'K42371'. 1181. '711181'. Hey. St. Cloud. I'll tell you the house when I get there. Open the door. Why did you come here this afternoon? Did somebody send you? Yes. Who was it? He phoned. He phoned? Who phoned? Was it the man you paid to kill your aunt? Yes. Was it a man called Radek? No. Who was it? Who was it? 'M V'. Hello. You here again? The overstuffed bloodhound. My friend Maigret. Sit down. Listen to some of this. I've been curious to know what you've been doing without me since lunchtime. I went to St. Cloud. 'I went to St. Cloud'. You never waste a word, do you? I'll be just as direct. What did you find at St. Cloud? A corpse? Yes. William Kirby. A witness for the state. Too bad. He leaves quite a legacy. And two beautiful women. I wonder what will become of them. They hate each other so much. Here's to their health. What do you know about Kirby? Look over there. I have invited him to join me several times. But he still insists he doesn't know me. The civil service mentality I think. What about Kirby? That is the question. But first I want him to join us. Maybe between the two of you, you'll keep up with me. Call him over. Sit down. What's your name? Janvier. - Janvier, huh? He's got a great future. Champagne for my two cousins. It will clear their brains. I want beer. - Afraid we do not serve beer, sir. Oh. I'll look everywhere of course. Janvier. It's too bad you didn't follow me this afternoon. Not true, chief. I never lost sight of him for a second. And still Kirby is dead. Inspect, will you try to connect me with Kirby's death? I hope you do try. I'd like to bring Janvier in as a witness. I'd like to get you as a witness. How do you explain Kirby's death? You were there. We have to prove it was suicide. Oh. So it was suicide, huh? Then maybe he did it because you were there. It's a bad time we're having. You put down a nine. I put down a ten. When you play a Jack, I'll play a Queen. When you play King, I'll play the Ace. The Ace of trumps and the game will be over. Do you know who that Ace is? Heurtin. Yes. Heurtin. You'll never find him. He got away. And you don't know where. But maybe I do. Have you thought where that puts you? Have you? Stop! It's depressing being surrounded by such ignorance. Mrs Henderson dies and Kirby dies. The women tell you nothing. Heurtin is lost. Like your job. Yet you understand nothing. It's depressing. I'll go somewhere else. Drink some more you brainless slave. I think in a little while Heurtin will be dead. Feel any better? - No. That's all in a night's work. - I don't remember a thing after .. Did I say anything I shouldn't? - Probably. What time is it? - Eight O'clock. Time to go to work. - Work? I want you to stay sober today. I want you to visit Radek's mother. Don't confuse me. Radek's mother is dead. It was investigated and isn't true. She's alive and somewhere in Paris. I want you to find her. What shall I say to her when I do? - Listen to what she has to say. Alright. What are you going to do? - I must Call my wife. When I stay out all night she develops a certain curiosity. What will you do after that? - I've a couple of things to do. Hello. Police. Heurtin. Heurtin. Police. Police. Sorry madam. Open up. Let me die. I want to die. Excuse me. Police Judiciaire. Have you a customer here by the name of Radek? I beg your pardon? - R-a-d-e-k. Johann Radek. Czech. No-one by that name. I'm quite sure. Have you got a customer here who uses the initials 'M.V'. M for Margaret. V for Vera. That may be. But it takes time to look up. Please hurry. This is the sixteenth post office I've been to this morning. So, now you know how I got the money. That is right. - Of course. It was childishly simple. From Kirby to me. But was it Kirby himself who mailed the letter? Don't think it may have been Mrs Kirby? - Have you got something to tell me? Nothing special. How is our old friend, Janvier? Tell me, Radek. What exactly do you want with me? I only came along for a talk. What will happen to Heurtin? - The guillotine. If you catch him again. You think we haven't got him? The police aren't infallible. You should know that. We know where he is. - Not according to Janvier. And drunken men usually tell the truth. Alright. We don't know where he is. - That's very interesting, Inspector. It puts everything in a different light. It's all child's play now. Let's talk about Kirby's funeral. His nice, rich funeral. That Mrs Kirby will be there in black. So attractive and so full of hate. Isn't it wonderful how women can poison one another's minds. It wouldn't surprise me if they were at each other's throats before long. Tell me, Inspector. Do you really think he shot himself? [ Telephone ] Maigret. I just broke into Radek's mother's place. I found Heurtin. He was strung up from the rafters. You'd better come over as soon as you can. Alright. Thank you. Now. What were you saying about the two women? Life is complicated, isn't it Inspector. You had the misfortune for once in your life to get an idea in your head. And try to see it through. A sudden flash of genius. Genius is like anything else, Inspector. You have to start young. To think, your career is at stake. A spotless record. You might have been promoted. How do you explain the suicide of that rich young man? Really, Inspector. If I were in your place I'd try to create a diversion. I'd arrest someone of no importance. Someone like Radek whose mother was a servant in Brunn. That wouldn't do any good, would it? You'd still have Heurtin's fingerprints and Heurtin's footprints. Then there's Kirby who shot himself when you reopened the investigation. You had to go through those two to get to me. And you haven't got either of them. So you can't touch me. You listen and you never hear anything. That is your trouble. In the future, I will be following you. It's a pleasure to see you, Inspector. I was afraid you had given up. There is so much to interest you. The two women for instance. You mustn't lose sight of me of course. But do you think they are safe, Inspector? You will never understand, Inspector. But I told you so at the start. You listen and watch. But you are no match for me. Let's stay together and enjoy ourselves. Who knows what tomorrow may bring? It's full of pretty girls here. And of course, I will pay. It's getting about the time here. Be sure the telephone is connected. Into your costumes, girls. Next show in five minutes. Come on. Taxi. Are you ready to admit you're groping in the dark? Shall I give you further proof? Cabbie, to the BelleVue Hotel in Grenelle. You've been here before, Inspector. While Heurtin slept. Wait for me. It gets more and more complicated, doesn't it. Go to St. Cloud please. Shall we follow her? Perhaps she'll lead us right to the scene of the crime. Wait for me. Here is Mrs Kirby. Aren't you going to see what she does? I've told you a hundred times you will never understand anything. I'll tell you again. You may be making a mistake, Inspector. Just imagine. Suppose they find another corpse in there in the morning. [ Clock chimes ] Aren't you interested in knowing what she's carrying? Look, Radek. Shall we go and take a look? If we put our heads together we might understand everything. Do you think so or would you rather not? Are you afraid to find a corpse inside? You talked about a corpse just now. Now that's a pack of nonsense. Whose could it be? Mrs Henderson is dead and buried. Her maid is dead and buried. William Kirby is dead and buried. Mrs Kirby just left in a taxi so she is alive. Joseph Heurtin? Nobody knows where Joseph Heurtin but he's a possibility. Edna Warren went inside but hasn't left. - I'll come with you. Good. And now we can walk right in and make ourselves at home. Let's go up. You see. The man who killed Mrs Henderson. It was a pretty easy job. Two sleeping women. No concierge. No dogs. Nothing at all to worry about. Radek, you were quite right about the corpse. That would be a nasty surprise. Have you heard of Mr Comelieu the examining magistrate? A man who can make himself very nasty when he wants to. I'm in the doghouse already for letting Kirby kill himself. You see, I was more or less there at the time. He is fed up with the whole business. Another corpse and indeed there would be a hullabaloo. And I'll be properly in the soup for having let Mrs Kirby walk off like that. Without finding out what she was carrying. As for you? How could you be implicated? You haven't been out of my sight the whole evening. And for the last week. We've spent a great deal of time together. Haven't we. By the way .. There is one thing I would like to know. Am I following you or are you following me? Come in, Radek. Come in. You aren't squeamish, are you? I don't suppose it makes any difference. I don't suppose it makes any difference to you. That a couple of women were knifed to death in the place. By the way, we never found that knife. Heurtin is supposed to have thrown it in the river as he went away. But you know. I am not so sure. In fact, I've come to the conclusion that it might have been hidden here. What was Mrs Kirby carrying just now? You see what I am getting at? Something about a foot long. Wouldn't that be about the size of a good dagger? You're quite right, Radek. You're quite right. This case is getting more and more complicated all the time. Hello. What is this? Footprints? We'd better follow these. We might even find what Mrs Kirby came for. [ Clock chimes ] Who could have wound that clock? Five o'clock already. It must be getting daylight. And so it is. The steps seem to lead to that closet. Wait a bit. What about that corpse of yours? Supposing it's there? We'd better be careful. Never mind. We've got to face facts sooner or later. You had better open it. Go on. Open it. Is this the man? - He's the one that was with me. He planned the burglary? - Yes. He said he'd help me make some money for Gisella. You will swear to that in court? - Yes. You murdered them. Then you wanted me to die for what you had done. I'll kill you. - Hey. He is no good to us dead. We must bring him into court safe and sound. I don't want to lose my job. And I want to save your neck. Lucas. You may take this young lady home. Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Warren. You know who this man is. He wrote me and told me to come here. Was he the one? Yes. He wrote to both you and Mrs Kirby telling you to go to the BelleVue. And then both of you to come here. He thought you might harm each other. He forgot one simple thing. That the police may intercept his mail. Mr Comelieu. Can we go now? - Yes. Thank you, Miss Warren. You played your part well. Comelieu? Maigret. I've got Heurtin. No. We can prove his innocence. I have got the murderer too. His name is Radek. R-a-d-e-k. He is a Czech. We are bringing him in. No. We can prove everything in court. What? He's got away. I'll phone you back. Put that gun away! Taxi. Taxi. Go and get the guard. We'll use the elevator. Police Judiciaire. Heurtin! Come back. You can't do anything. Heurtin. For the love of heaven. Keep following, Maigret. Keep following. Power it up, Maigret. Watch now, Maigret. Watch now. You will see me below. Take it down. Maigret. Maigret. Stop. Janvier. Help Radek down. - Okay. We go down. You won't follow me now, Maigret. [ Latin blessing ] ..s-d..
