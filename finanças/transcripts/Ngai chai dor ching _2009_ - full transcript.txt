There is a saying in Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea". The sea and women are mysterious, irritated and dangerous. Oh, I make it wrong. Hemingway never said that. Well... whatever, everybody makes mistakes. Especially, when you are facing the sea and come across a tsunami. Jack, what... what do you... think about the stock market? The index is gonna drop a bit and surely reaches 30,000 at the year end. It'd be better for you to privatize your firm at a lower price. Don't worry. Send my regards to Isabella. Bye, Richard. Mr. Lan... Are you disabled? Why didn't you knock the door first? How long have you been working here? 3 days, Fanny got miscarriage because of your harshness. She quitted. Then you hired me. What is it? Tonight, you are gonna have dinner with Mr. Ho at 8... Cancel it. Meeting with Mr. Lau at 9... Cancel it too. At 10... Are you Parkinson? Don't you know what I am saying? I am not available tonight. I have 4 parties, 8 models, 16 actresses waiting for me. Understand? You'd have told me you are a sex-addict though. What kind of attitude is this? Why would I hire you? I'd have fired you in 3 days. What's your salary? I will tell you if you raise my salary. And... you should take off your shoes as you come into my room. I am not used to look at women at this angle. Except on bed. What's wrong? No response? Why would it keep selling? Are you retarded? Get me the best computer technician! Be calm! I am PhD of C.S. In M.I.T. Why didn't you tell me when I hired you? Hurry up! I did write it in my resume. You just kept talking to your gals on the phone during the interview. It's the Auto matching System you installed 3 years ago. A password is needed to cancel it. Any password clue? Yes, your girlfriend's name. You said you will love her forever and you'd marry her too. I used to make these promises to all my girlfriends. 3 years ago? I can't even remember my girlfriend's name from 3 days ago. It seems to be... Barbara? Erica? Veronica? Don't worry! It's done. Turn on again? There's a 168 hours power back-up for my computer. Even you break it, all the trade orders will be transferred to other stock markets. So cool? Who's the genius writing this program? It's me. I am not too bad myself. I am from M.K.S.W.C.T.L. What's it? Mong Kok Shun Wo Ching Ting Lo (computer repairer). That's how I sold all my stocks, and even doubled short selling. However, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy that night. The global stock markets collapsed. A week ago, if I didn't make this mistake, I would be a dead meat in this tsunami. In this historic financial tsunami, I can be the survivor and big winner, just because I am fluke. Come back, honey! I want to eat you. We want to eat you. Again? Why do you two have such a good appetite? Okay... Coming... To celebrate my fluke, I lied to my girlfriend Chu-chu, I bought a new yacht and hang out with Ding and Dong for 72 hours. I want to eat you. No way, I want to eat you first. It's pear. Not you, try again. You... Where are you two from? It's tedious to peel off the skin! Am I serving you or you two serving me instead? When will we go ashore? I feel very seasick. I am already rich, for such poor services of you, Honey. You two will be poor forever. Just eat yourself! Sell it... Shit! Hello, who is it? Babe, you are not coming back? Chu-chu, it's quite disastrous here in States. Many big financial firms are closing down. I am almost gone mad. Hold on a second... I said sell them all! Do you understand? Are you listening to me? You stupid American! I have hardly slept for an hour in 2 days. Poor babe! I will come back once it's settled. I will give you a big surprise, okay? How big? Shockingly big! I'll hang up now. Okay. Bye... See, women are so gullible. You just have to keep giving them surprise. And they will always have hope in you. Chouette watches for you two! Surprise! Happy? Happy... As my great grand father-in-law said, it's not guilty for a man to cheat, but if you don't give compensation to your wife, that's doubly guilty! Sir, this 8-carat round-shaped diamond is new stuff. 8 carat? Affection means much more. Have you got smaller ones? Like 0.0008 carat ones? Do you have? Why are you so frightened? I am a customer, not a robber. Alright... 8-carat then. Take the card... Why are you still so frightened? It's so expensive, how could you pay by card? I could even buy a 16 million yacht by card. This diamond is smaller than your nostril. Why can't I pay for this? What if it can? Are you gonna get nude on the street? Wasting my time. Mr. Lan. What now, Connie? Are you losing your memory? You keep calling me every 33 minutes. Did you get ashore? How many times have I told you? I am getting off from a plane, not from a boat. Don't let anyone know that I was on board. Are you using the car today? It needs to be checked today. I have 19 cars. Which one is you talking about? I don't know. Fanny just left a memo for it. Okay... Check them all. All? Napoleon said, war is like musical chairs for winners and losers. You never know when you will be kicked out, and Step up to the guillotine. These ignorant financial scum will be screwed without knowing anything. It's stuck... give it back to me... Give it back to me... Hello. Is Mr. Jack Lan here? We are calling from the card center. I am his... fianc?? What is it? Please let him know his Diamond Card has already been overdraft. Overdraft? His card is temporarily invalid. He needs to clear his debt asap. My 8-carat! No... The no. You dialed can't be reached at the moment. Please try again later. Madam! Someone is towing the cars outside. Tow? Miss, please sign here. We need to take the cars back. Why? We don't make the orders, we just follow them. We are ordered to take the cars back. Please sign here. Are you mistaken? Drive that car away. It's such a chaos. These Lehman's victims are going mad. They are trying to break through the security line. Both sides are pushing against each other... Give it back to me! Give it back to me! All Lehman's victims want to get their money back. Give it back to me! What are you doing? Where're my cars? What's going on? Break-in? It's good that you are back. Chu-chu! What's happening? Chu the hell! I told you not to call me Chu-chu. You bad mouth! Just keep calling me Chu-chu. You such a midget pig! I have been putting up with this for long. For God's sake, you are screwed by the Lehmans. Card is overdraft, cars get towed and you cried the hell out on TV. It's really a BIG surprise! Johnny. I am coming over, see you at the airport. Bye. Love you! What's up? Do you think you are the only one who cheats? Men are so gullible. Look at you, I guess you have no money for me now. So I just took everything, leaving 3 things for you. Get lost! Bitch! Poor bastard! Still have a bad mouth? You are good for nothing. Churchill said, Failure is just a medal for a great person. After mourning for 88 mins 42 secs, I pull myself together again. Hey, Peter, let's go out tonight. I lost badly on the accumulator. Much worse than your Lehmans. No, listen to me. Don't be upset, I really can't help you. Sam. Wrong number! Don't be so naive. Do you think there is unconditional true love? The no. You dialed cannot be reached. Please try again later. Look at you, you are physically totally under-developed. If you have no money, how could I put up with you these 2 years? The owner said he's out of town. Don't call him these years. The owner said he doesn't know you. Stop bugging him even if you are dying. If you are broke, no one will love you, stupid! Richard! Don't hang up... I... I am not Richard! Wrong... number. Stop pretending! Who'd be stammering like you? Sir... are you alright? Sir, are you okay? Are you alright? Angel? Am I in heaven? Here is Lan Kwai Fong. Stop fooling me. I've been hanging around in Lan Kwai Fong for years. Why haven't I seen such a beautiful girl like you? You have wings. Aren't you an angel then? Whatever you like. Sir, why are you so drunk? Are you upset or something? Angel babe, who wouldn't have trouble though? Human being must has trouble problems... Let share your trouble with others. Maybe it will ease your mind. "Love is elsewhere" gathering? Why is it so fussy getting into heaven? No, in fact your problem is you have been focusing your own misfortune too much. There're many people who are much more pathetic than you. You can try to share your misfortune with others. Cheer each other up, then it will light up your life. Are you okay? I'm fine. Love is elsewhere? What the hell! There is no love in this world. As long as you are eager to give and sacrifice, you will get that. Give? That's easy. I give you money, enough? Give me love, hurry up! Come on! Give it to me... Do you know there are only 2 kinds of people in the world? Rich and poor... Man and woman. Gay and normal... Old and young. Live and dead. It's happy and unhappy. Stop preaching. I just know money is happiness, no money is sadness. You are rich, are you happy then? Don't be so frustrated and negative. Try to be a normal person. As you help others out, that will cheer you up. Angel. What's your name? Angel is Angel. Angel, what's your phone number? Tell me. Dr. Fung, I have been so upset lately. That's normal. Who would be happy lately? Why ain't I feeling happy for being so rich? My IQ is 148. I read all college text books in high school. I started a computer shop instead of getting into college. I have earned my first million before 22. I have been hanging around with tons of chicks. I should be one of the leaders in future world. I should win a Nobel prize or Oscar though. But why at this moment... I am feeling so lost. Should be... You're not counseling me? You're hurting me. It's hopeless! Please let me die. Dr, do you need to see a doctor? If that doctor can stop my 3rd mistress running away with someone... my 2nd mistress urges me to marry her, my wife wants a divorce... And I have a crush on another married woman... I think such a doctor would be the savior. You are having a family crisis. You're insane now! You shouldn't take my case and charge me! Go away! Where can I go? I'm lost. Buy some charcoal. Bring your wife and all mistresses out. Go for a BBQ, and settle it out. Don't try to go away, just face it bravely. Still unsettled, come back to me, OK? OK. Very good. Thanks. You're welcome. Thank you so much. Not at all... I will get my prescription. Buy some charcoal and chicken wings. One can heal others but not himself. I'm eligible to be a doctor. Dr. Fung? Sorry, I got stuck in the traffic. I am Christy, I called yesterday. I am coming to get you, perfect timing. Christy, what's your problem? Well... the patient isn't me. It's my twin sister, Christine. Twins! So wonderful! Go ahead... We have been closed since we were small. We learnt ballet together and we were doing well. Until 3 years ago, my sister sprained her leg accidentally. And she failed getting into the Royal Ballet Institute. What a pity! She became so desperate since then. She went out every night and came home late. Hanging out at night could be a kind of relaxation. That's fine. She starts smoking and drinking, sleeping with different guys. Oh, no! Casual sex is terrible. It's unacceptable to me! It's so dirty! Sometimes she comes home and beats me out. I thought she's now suffering from... Rage disorder. It's possible. She is my only sister, I really care about her. Dr. Fung, please help my sister. As a doctor, I will screw you... I will surely... help you and give her treatment. Bring her here, I can help her. I will make appointment some other time. After talking to you, I feel so much better now. Thanks. Try to be a normal person to help others. That will cheer you up. Christy... I told you I am on leave. Can you stop bothering me? Boss, the stock market is going down endlessly. When will you settle the short selling orders and take enough profit? I set an auto matching program. As the Hang Seng Index reaches 11,000 and Dow Jones reaches 7,000, it will buy back upward. What are you busy with? Still mourning? I am screwing... helping others. Are you out of your mind? Can you help me find an address with a registered phone no? Except those calling cards. Will you raise my salary if I do? I will screw you instead, write it down. 1, 2. Good, hands out, bend down. Lift up the dress, turn around, come out. Stretch your right leg. Butterfly your arms... Going up, look forward. Good, arms down. Not this way. Dr. Fung? Hello! My little princesses. I heard about you and your sister, I felt so upset. My heart strangled. I just can't eat at all. So I am going to give you an Active Intensive Microtherapy. I would like to meet your sister. Thanks for your concern, but Christine is not here now. It's too bad. That's okay. I could know you better. I mean... your could tell me more about your sister's behavior. That would be useful for her therapy. Well, it's no better than seeing her in person. You go to this nightclub. She is a dancer there. Fire... dancer... I can tell from the name that it'd be a dirty and evil place. Don't worry! I will check it out tonight. And save your sister from hell. Boss, it's been so long. Why don't you come here more often? You look great! Membership card, please. I'm not a member, I'm here looking for someone. Is here a dancer called Christine? So? You can leave your message on her blog or through SMS and MSN. You also can reach her at facebook. Or you can even go to her place... Cut the crap! You shouldn't teach him to find her. We only serve members here. The membership fee is cheap, about $100,000. I join now. The legendary 18 carat Diamond Credit Card? May I take some photos of it. Can I go in now? Sir... even if you pay now, you can't go in too. Officially, we need 7 working days to check your background, health history... You have to wait for confirmation. What about unofficially? Get me a fast pass. Sir, are you trying to bribe us? According to the POBO, whatever chapter and caption... Just shut up if you don't know. Boss, I am so satisfied with this amount. If he has the same amount too, that would be great. So money-minded, young men. Good! What are your names? I am Door. I am Man. Door-man? What a perfect couple for doorman! Can I go in now? Spread your legs. What's up? Body searching! Do you think I am molesting you? By regulations, guests are prohibited to bring any illegal articles in. No photo shooting, leave all your personal belongings. So strict, it'd be fun inside. You got this VIP room. You can drink and eat whatever you want. So nice? That would be charged in the bills. Please wait for a sec., Christine is coming. Christine? I am... Why are you dancing here? What kind of dance do you know? Like... If you want to chat with someone, I think... you came to the wrong place. Boss, how is it? Have fun? $5,000. Thanks. Where's Christine? She's gone. Staying here after dancing for what? You want her to kiss you and marry you? Encore, one more round. Sorry, Christine has a strange rule. She won't dance twice to the same client in a night. You can come tomorrow. Tomorrow? No kidding. I am on fire now. What should I do? As she serves dancing but no chatting, I used my master plan the other night. Waiting for her after work. Christine. Why are you here? I have been waiting for you. Sorry, I don't make friends with clients. Well... I am a psychologist. Your sister Christy told me to come for you. Psychologist? Come on. What does she want? She cares about you. She'd like to know how you are doing lately. As you can see, anything wrong? Let's have a drink and have a real good chat. Shut up! Tell her that she is the one having problem. You have been practicing ballet, why did you go for lap dance? What's the problem with lap dance? That's one of the performing arts. Only bad women go for lap dance and only decent women go for ballet, huh? What era is it now? What kind of thinking is that? Right! You have been exposing your body... I think, subconsciously, you have a strong tendency of exhibitionism. Yes. I like to see those guys watching me dancing and getting excited. I purposely not let them touch me to get them addicted. I feel fascinated. How's it, handsome? You are so sensitive. There are women of sexy or cool. There'd be someone choosing to be nun or hooker. Also there'd be someone practicing ballet or lap dance. Any problem for that? No, there would be a problem if no hookers. So, stop bugging me. Christine. Sorry, are you burnt? Don't touch me! Sorry. Things between my sister and I, that's none of your business! Christine, I'll keep watching you. I am a big fan of you! Strongly support you! This British policewoman switched to pole dance business. This German teacher is awesome, she gave a strip dance for the whole school for free, she's hot. But this one is weird... Why did you give me such information? They are abnormal, immoral. It doesn't mean that it's right for my sister to practice lap dance. She didn't come home last night again. What I mean is... as this is your sister's choice to be a lap dancer to entertain others, you should respect her choice. Dr. Fung, will you let your loved one gamble, take drugs and doing nothing to stop her? That's exaggerating. She just performs dance and some twists. Don't take her as a slut. In fact, she let no one touch her hand. You just saw her once, you seem to be on her side. Absolutely not. Teacher... come and have a look. I know the steps. Don't touch me! Alright... I will come later. Dr. Fung, if you have no clue to heal my sister, I won't force you for that. She doesn't care about herself, I won't take her as my sister then. She didn't come home last night again. This is called multi-personality syndrome. Wait, what about your multi-affairs syndrome? My 3rd mistress ran away with someone, just let her go. My 2nd mistress wants to marry me, just dump her. My wife wants a divorce, just soothe her. And the one with husband... We are both married, that's fair. Keep adultery. There's an British patient of MPS... who has derived 12 identities. 12? The whole Man U team with Ferguson? Not that united. I just want to know about Christy and Christine, who's the primary and who's the secondary. That's not important. Because as the new identity derives, the original one will disappear. It means not both of them would stay? Don't worry, it can be healed by taking medicine. Give her the red one to let her identity stay. Give her the green one to let her identity go. Remember, for the same identity, never take both piles. Or the side effect would be unpredictably problematic. Only one can survive? Christy or Christine? Christy, are you alright? Sister came home last night. She forced me to drink. As I was drunk, she even... gave me tattoo. That's a tattoo sticker, it could be rubbed off. It's real! She forced me to drink even she knows I am allergic to alcohol. She's trying to kill me! I don't think so. If she really wants to kill you, she'd simply throw you off the building as you got drunk, right? Let me fetch you some water to calm you down, okay? Red one to let her identity stay. Green one to let her identity go. I understand now. She doesn't care about me at all. She's no longer my sister. She's wrong, but you too. Both of you are about... the same. Tonight, you go to the Fire Put this pill... in her drink. This is... Right, it's poison! You want to poison yourself... your sister? I have thought thoroughly. This will stop her from getting degenerated. This is the only way to make us happy. Us? I know you have been good to me, but... I can tell you have a crush on my sister. Right? Right? If you help me for this, we will be happy ever after. That's fine! You know I have been longing to sleep... stand on your side. What is this? MDMA? Panadol. Panadol? Staying at home as you are sick. Confiscated! Room 3. Have fun. Next! Acute abdominal pain! I need to go to the washroom. Shit! Where'd I put these pills? I'd be poisoned to death if it's torn. Get something to stick it. Sir, are you done? It's been quite a while. It's like landslide, rainstorm, dreary screams, all in unison. I am ready, get Christine over here. Wait! Your eyes are sneaky. Are you hiding something from us? I didn't wear my contact lens. Feeling uncomfortable. You are sweating, are you nervous? Meeting hot babe, adrenaline level is rising, natural secretion. Your secretion is fast, huh? We still need to search you up. Give me a break, we are friends... Friends the hell! This is only our second encounter. I do the searching myself. All clear. That's body searching? It's much more like self-fondling. Don't you need to take off my pants to check my anus? Good idea... You are really too much. Why are you here again? Chris... Go away! Christy is sick. She's sick? It's quite severe. She's dying. It concerns you. Come in first. Heredity disease? Yes... Congenital Syndrome Acquired Mediterranean Hormone Organic Malfunctioning. What is it? It's a terminal disease. Because you two are twins. You have 99.99% chance in getting the disease. I won't believe it! I know you wouldn't believe it. So I brought the medicine here to give you a simple test for it. How? It's simple. You take the pills. If you don't yawn within a minute, then you are fine. So simple? What is it? I was afraid that they would find it out. So I put it in a condom for safety. You take the green one. What's going on? Color fading? After heating treatment? Aren't they the same? No, the yellow one is the poison that Christy gave me. Poison? What... What did you say? No poison. Did Christy tell you to do this? She tries to kill me. Don't be silly! You two are so closed. How would she... Tell me! What? I am just trying to help you. You are not helping me. You are helping my sister kill me. You are her, she is you. My God! I am gonna quit. Please give me a break. Okay. You said one of them is poison. Tomorrow I will put all the pills into her glass of water. Let see who will die first. Don't do that. You are her, she is you! You poison her to death, that's killing yourself too! What's going on? He molested me! How dare you? Molest? You are dead. Go away! No... Christine... The pills are poisonous, you would die for that. Don't do that. Dare you bring drugs in? Beat! Thanks for watching the morning news. News headline... Christy... Don't drink! What? It's poisoned? Let's go to the hospital! What for? You tell me first. Did you meet my sister? Sister? You are suffering from MPS. Your sister doesn't exist. It's just your imagination... Impossible! I have checked it already. You sprained your leg 3 years ago. And you failed getting into the Royal Ballet School. There is no sister, you are the only one. Last night, you took all my pills, including the poison ones. You are now hurting yourself. I got it! You love my sister. You two are trying to kill me. Yeah, I do. I want to rape you too, alright? Come on, let's go to the hospital. How is it? Shit... What the number for 999? Are you okay? Hey, Connie... What did you eat? Mighty pills? Hey man! Why are you hugging me? Are you gay? Who is it? I am Chris. Brother of Christy and Christine. Another one? Luckily, the poison pill she took is just vitamin. Otherwise, you are encouraging someone to suicide. I just want her to be cured, no matter how much it costs. Send her to States for treatment. My master is an expert in serious cases. What cases did he heal then? He healed the Cannibal. Let go of me! Christy. What? I said I am Chris. I warned you already. You can't let the same identity take both red and green pills. Now the third identity is derived. Sorry, it's all my fault. No bull-shit! Just let go of me! No matter what, I will wait for you. Stop that, punk! I don't like guys. I can't guarantee that after treatment... It will turn out to be Christy, Christine or Chris. I will wait for you. Let's dance together, whatever will do. Crazy! Dance the hell! Bastard, you bastard! I am going to chop you off. Don't stimulate her anymore. Charlie Chaplin said, comedy originates from tragedy. At this moment, Christy is such a tragedy. I just wish that our future would be a comedy. Hold it carefully. Say bye. Bye, sis. Bye. Angel? Angel. It's you? Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I couldn't find you all over HK, Macau and Mainland. Your lie is too fake. Is that sweet? Ice-cream would be sweeter. You want one? You are giving out flyers and selling ice-cream. When will you become a beer promoter? The economy is bad now, I have to do everything. $10,000, thanks. $10,000 for an ice-cream? It's for charity. You can afford it. Ice-cream for charity? We are raising money for the children living in ELDCs. Fine... Always using skinny children for fund raising. Will you donate or not? Of course... Otherwise I couldn't eat your... ice-cream. You want some more? You want me to be the first handsome man to die of ice-cream? You are too greedy. You want both Christy and Christine. But it turns out you getting nothing. You deserved it. Greed will lead you to success. That's too hard. I just know that helping others will lead you to happiness. Angel, please look around. We are on earth, please talk in reality. You don't believe me? Yes, please help me first. I am so lonely now. All I need is love. Tomorrow 8am, I will give you love. Oi Man Estate Ming Lee congee store? Grannies, watch out, it's hot... What's your game for today? Selling congee? Cheating senior's money? Not for selling, it's free. Lovely congee for seniors. So, when will you give me love? We can't make it in front of so many elderly now. I am shy. So many congee here, it's all full of love. Just take as much as you want. Help me deliver the congee. That table, thanks I'm sorry... Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me. Okay. No problem. My turn! Who want super congee? Nice and hot, good for health. Who wants... My hands are icy hot. You have been a nice person today, don't you feel happy? For helping you, I have hurt my arms, sacrificing for my pride and charm... should you marry me in return? How could you love a girl before knowing her well? Miss, it's about time, please get on the car. Okay. Are you from a rich family? You'd tell me earlier. I was worried that I am no match to you. It's for you, you've been great today. What's your next game? Where can I find you? Fate will bring us together. Bye. Connie, jot down the plate number, AB 18. Find out the registered address and background, report to me asap. That car is owned by a BVI company. I can't find the address. You can't? Then you needn't work next month. Great! I have been longing for a vacation. Nuts! If you can't find the address, pay me your salary next month. How is it, kid? Are you alright? Get up. Are you okay? Sorry... Sister didn't see you. I don't mean it, I am rushing for work. I am going, bye. Good insight! Sis Mary. Morning. Sir, do you want massage? Any reservation? No, but I want that girl just coming back to work to serve me. Sir... Taking off the clothes and getting on bed yet? I did the warm up and stretching too. Should I turn off the light? Okay, it's more romantic. Sir, do you want a ball massage? Ball massage? Sure! Are you trying to kill me? It hurts! That's ball massage. What ball is it? So hard! Marble massage, the latest foot reflex logic therapy from India. Who are you? I am Mary, you appointed me to serve you. Damn you! I appointed that girl who just came back to work. Yeah. I just came back to work. You are not that girl. She has long curly hair. She is tall with firm boobs. I got it, you made a mistake. The one that you want is Caca. She and I just came back together. I pushed so hard on your trigeminal point, why you have no feeling? Of course, I am expecting a nice sirloin steak. But it turns out to be a minced beef ball, how should I response to that? I see. Caca is the nonpareil in massage business lately. Numerous clients come here appointing her for... taking off. So many clients? Her hands must be terribly busy! But she won't have sex with clients. No way! She marks up herself for higher price, right? She is kind and generous. She works hard to earn more to built a new school at her home town. So mighty? The most precious thing is, she is still a virgin. Virgin massage girl? Are you kidding? You are reacting now. Your jokes are full of exaggerations! Of course I will react! Sis Mary, be frank. Can you help me screw Caca? It's tough. No true love in Happy place and massage centre. If you were her, seeing numerous guys taking off pants every day, how could you like a normal guy then? If that's the case, I'd be abnormal. It's okay for no basic salary. Is it Ming? Yes... Madam, thanks for hiring my niece. Niece? Didn't you say he's your nephew? Her nephew Chung is blind too. Auntie, you are wrong. Yes... Chung became blind when he was 5. Ming is color-blind since he was born. Your family relatives are all pathetic. Misfortune family! All hard luck! He is so pathetic. Okay. Start working. Thanks, Madam. Thanks. You are too fake. Aren't you too? I am doing you a big favor. You get paid for that. Stop pretending you have mercy. What are you smelling? Checking the money smell. You are such a nice guy, maybe you will use tissue paper to fool me. The rest room is on this level. Wait. What's up? Caca is coming. Sis Mary. Caca! He's my niece. From now on, he'll be my trainee. Stupid kid, come and say hello. How are you, Sis Caca? I am Ming. Are you the one I ran into yesterday? Auntie. She's the one I ran into yesterday. Her chests are soft and smell nice. Her voice is sweet and her smile is so charming. How coincident! You two are meant to meet. Caca, Room 6 client has been waiting for long. Coming. I got to go, bye. Bye... Bye, Sis Caca. She's so cute! Hey, are you nuts? You stupid, what a bullshit! Charming smile, can you see it? You are blind and you can't see though. But you always act like you can see. Ming, what are you doing? Madam, I... am reading newspaper. You are blind, how can you read? I had depression few years ago, my doctor treated me with back to order behavioral therapy. Reading newspaper 5 mins everyday like a normal person does. Then I felt so relieved. So amazing? Listen. There's a client looking for a blind for foot massage. Come on... Hurry up. I am rushing to Macau for gambling. Sir, honestly, your feet are so stinky. So? Can't I have massage for stinky feet? That's not what I meant. Even if you got shit on it, I still massage for you. But, should you soak your feet in disinfectant first? No way! It will wash away my luck. No more excuse. I will beat you up if you don't massage for me. Harder! Ming, what's up? Sis Caca. You are not used to the job? Or the client is bad? That client molested me! Silly boy, don't cry. Silly boy... Remember, we are professional. We will give our best service to all clients. Understand? Yes... go ahead. Keep touching my head, I will be happy. Do you want more than that? I do. Let me give you a massage on your most sensitive part. Really? Not comfortable? Is fingertip the most sensitive part? I thought it's the other part. Relax and you will know. What have you done? Sorry... It's okay. Feeling great? If you can always massage my hands, I will be happy as watching rainbow. Time to work. Bye. Bye. Her hand massage is so terrific. If she massages my little brother, it'd be... Bye, Madam. Bye... Be on time tomorrow. I forgot to take my wallet. You two leave first. Why are you always so absent mind? Bye. See you tomorrow. Is anyone still here? I am gonna lock the door.
