- [Man] This is an interview with detective Jane Joy Wilson 11168-24B conducted at Police Internal Investigations Headquarters in the matters regarding senior Detective Michael Brown and Detective Robert John Walsh. - I joined the service straight out of school. I was 18. (eerie music) I was wanting to be a detective, pitting myself against the crooks, out smart 'em. Everything was so black and white. There was a right and wrong, good and a bad. I believed in the law. I believed in upholding the right. I thought the law was a good set of rules and there could be justice for all. Well, I was young. (dramatic music) (train rumbling) (groans) - This bitch is as ripe as a Queensland banana. About a week, I reckon. - What do you reckon, a climber? - I make a dero. We're not getting dirty for a fucking dero, no way. - Tides coming in. Be in south Melbourne by the morning. - Now ya talking. - What about the clothes? (distant sirens blaring) - Looks like false alarm, boys! - Sir? - Yeah, I can see how the constables got confused Detective. - Definitely has a look, Senior. Couple more years under their belt, that'll develop a policeman's art. - Yeah, practice makes perfect. - Sir, I don't understand. - Don't sweat it, Constable. I can easily see how you could mistake that piece of plastic for a floater. - Can happen to anyone, mate. - Plastic! So with all due respect, Sir... - It's got a face. - How long you blokes been in the field? - Three weeks. - We know a body when we see one. - You got plans for the night, Senior? - I was having to have a smooth shift tonight, Detective. - Likewise, Senior. Course, if we were to be on the end of a floater... - Jesus, perish that thought, Detective. That'd make it an absolute bastard of a shift. All the paperwork, the autopsy. Fair to say we'd be absolutely pissed. - We wouldn't be forgetting that now, right? - That's not the worst of it, Senior. - Well, constables on the end of a call like that, well, they have to get down in the drink, fish the bastard out. We are talking messy. - Fire is what we call a fairytale situation, boys. Green. - Anyway, if there was a flight in the river tonight, well, the tide would sooner or later to take it over to south Melbourne. Then it'd be a south bank problem, wouldn't it? - Those pricks can do some work for a change. - So, what's it going to be boys? - Okay, sir, will that be all? (eerie music) - Hey, grab us a branch or a stick or something, Chris. Come on you fuck. (dramatic music) - That's what I all creative police work. - [Man] And that mongrel is dead. - What happened, Evans, someone confessed? - Police work Walshy. Deduction, detection, something you wouldn't know a lot about mate. - You're a dead set Sherlock Holmes, man. - Well, he sure as shit ain't John Holmes. (laughing) No, seriously Steve, congratulations. - Thank you and stuff you too JJ. - Good work on the Quentin killing, Evans. There's a play on the table, we'll take it. - And? - Manslaughter. - What!. - I don't want any grief on this. It's taken and that's all there is to it. Now, come on, people, let's have some more black up here. - Jesus Christ what's the fucking point! (telephone rings) - What we are about to receive let us be truly grateful. Homicide, Detective Jane Wilson speaking. Yeah. (low moody music) Where? 20 minutes. Okay. Heads up, Robbie, we've got a redball. (dark moody music) (sirens blaring) - Looks pretty clean, see anything else? - [Robbie] No. - [Man] Hi detectives, is it the creep? What can you tell us? - Keep those pricks well fucking back! Bloody vultures. (sirens blaring) Wilson. Yes, sir. Now I've got a girl about eight or nine. Vietnamese, I think. Kids are kids, sir. Now somewhere else, just dumped here. We don't know anything till the autopsy, but red definitely. It's messy. No, there won't be anything, this prick knows what he's doing. It's more than deja vu. There's trophy mutilation. Yeah, it's him. No sir, there is no doubt in my mind. He's back. (rumbling) (thuds) - Hey, Jim you take a puck. - No, that's okay, so. - Go on. Make you feel better. Nah, that's all right, sir. - Go on mate, we won't say anything. - Relieves the tension. - Yeah, gets it out of the system very nicely. - I don't want to. - It's the only satisfaction you get on the job. - It's a heart attack at 40 for you, shit for brains, while me (thuds) 100. (man groans) - Go on, piss off! Give us some privacy while we brace the suspect. And tell the boys to turn the place over! Ronnie Spence, you pathetic ingrate. I thought you had a reputation you know, as a hard nut. - Get fucked. - What do you reckon Maxie, does this guy look tough to you? - No way. - My thoughts exactly. - Maybe he's a cracked king or something. - Is that right, Ronnie? Is there a Betty Superman in there? - What are you fucking bastards on about, aye? - What you mean, you're not bullet proof? - Give me a fucking break, will ya! - Then why the fuck are you asking to get pinged? - I ain't done nothing, you fucking bastards! - Oh what are you, a bloody lawyer now? How do you know what's nothing or not? - You've stepped on some toes, dickhead. - Get fucked. - This guy's a cool one, Maxie. Now, what do you recommend? - Think he had a guardian angel looking after him. - I can look after myself, mate. - Sure you can Ronnie, but a little bit of protection. Now that wouldn't be helping, would it? - You said it, I didn't. (eerie music) (thuds) (groans) - Where's your protection now, stud? You gotta learn, Ronnie. When not even a certain patron from CIB can save your ass from us. Now, where's the rest of your stash? - Oh, that's it, dickhead. You think I carry more than that on me? Should be worth a piss week fine, eh? It's a pleasure to bust the nuts off a smart ass like you. - How many you constables got? - Looks like heroine, sir. - Sure does. - [Ronnie] That's bullshit! You fucking load me up! - I'd say about two ounces. - You fucking dog! - Put that shit in the van. - You fucking stitched me up, you fucking... - See if he'll get himself out of that one, hey. - Know a new song. - How do you pronounce this, wanghoong? - Hung. - Her name's Tran Hung. - Tran Hung. Girlfriend's caught a tenner in the interviews. Lucy with a mom and dad. Guess that the grandmother. - She the only child? - Yeah. Sp how do you want to play it? - I'm the primary. - Just thought if you wanted me to do it, I... - This is my case, Robbie. You said the 19th floor, yeah? - 196B. So, let's do it. - Mrs. Hung, we found your baby. (elevator doors rumbling) - Detective Brown. - Stitch it up, did you? - Nearly broke my hand on the noisy little prick. There's no way he'll be going down quietly. - Good. That'll teach Hill to stick his hands in my business. You think Robbie Walsh'll (indistinct speech)? - He's around. - You make sure you pass on my regards. Good dog. - [Man] Heavy bleeding. Suggests mechanical penetration. Left and right oriels missing. It's just light. Opening the chest cavity. (saw buzzing) Head. Removing brain. I'd say this is definitely a creep, Jane. - Yeah. (dark eerie music) (heavy breathing) (dark eerie music) - You okay? - Come on Jane, get it together. - I can't do this one. - Yes, you can. - Got something for me? (sniffs) - Bite down. (dark eerie music) - Jesus. - We'll get the bastard. - Promise? - We'll get him, we'll kick his fucking ass. We'll fuck his fucking fuck. (laughs) - What does he say? - When? (dark eerie music) (sniffs) - What's wrong with me? - You're okay. Everything's all right. - What'd you give me? - Something new. Calm you right down. - [Jane] Better check with Sullivan, he'll be clear by now. - You gonna be all right? - Gonna help me, Robbie? We've got to get him this time, okay. - He's going down. That's a fact. - How can I help you? Rick Mills, I'm the manager. - Detective Toni Johnson, Detective David Wright, gaming and vice squad. - Cut straight to the chase, Rick. I'm just coming to have a bit of a chat about some of the stock you've been retailing. See, it seems we've had quite a few complaints. - Ah yeah? - You're selling some goods here that are causing quite a degree of offense to certain members of the general public. - Now look, we're specialized in adult products. We sell to a very specific clientele. If people don't like it they should stay away. - Yeah, we don't force them to come in here. - You don't have to stop them from coming in either. Now, look Rick, this is not a restricted establishment, but I have cited in my quick appraisal of some of your goods, numerous instances of visuals, which would be restricted under the R classification system. This book, for instance. (tsking) - But we're not breaking the law. You can find that book in plenty of legitimate, unrestricted shops. - Don't quote the bloody law to me, mate! I am the fucking law! - We don't have to get along with you. You have to get along with us. Now, if you keep that in mind, things will be okay. - Look, Rick, we're not interested in you. We don't give a shit about you. Our problems are with massage parlors, drugs, child pornographers. - A bunch of chinless wonders sticking needles in their dicks. Making with rubber gloves is light relief for us. Good for a laugh. - But you see, we've had numerous complaints from various quarters and so we have to come in here, like it or lump it, and read you the riot act. - Tick you off. - Tell you what's what. - Understand? - Good, so here's the list of items we want to see removed off the shelf ASAP. If you don't comply... - well, let's just say we'll make it our personal responsibility to create a very unpleasant life for you. - Christ! This is some of our best stuff. - Look, Rick, just get the shit off the fucking shelf, okay! Some of it finds its way under the counter. - Special customers. - Then that's none of our business. Now, we can't be much fairer than that, can we? Good boy. See, you do the right thing by us and we'll do the right thing by you, okay? Okay! - Okay. (moody music) (answering machine speaking indistinctly) - [Man] Just wondering if you could give me some information about today's events. Please give me a call at the office. (beeping) - [Janine] Hi Jane, this is Janine Dawson. Look, I saw the news tonight and I'm wondering, do you think it's him? You know, is he back? Sorry, look, I didn't want to bother you at home. At home, give me are how thing with you? (beeps) - [Rose] Rose Edwards here, Jane. And listen, I heard about the autopsy today. You know how the grapevine works in this place. Look. (machine beeps) - [Woman] I'd like you to come in and see me. (indistinct answering machine speech) (door knocks) - Just in time. - You got the money? - [Man] Nice to see you too. Come on in, relax, have a beer. - Just give us the money. (low eerie music) - The usual. - What happened to the witness stay? - Oh, they came back to the home ground advantage. Can't really blame them, can ya? I mean the authorities are much more accommodating here. - What about our deal? - I'm just going to have to restructure it. - I don't think so. - I'm not asking your permission, Detective. - Well, I don't fucking like it, thank you. - I don't give a shit what you like or what you don't like. They're back and that's all there is to it. Oh, come on, mate. You're too involved to get emotional, it's just commerce. Supply and demand, that's all. If it wasn't us, it'd be some other bastards. At least we're keeping the merchandise where it belongs, in the slums, yeah? Come on, mate. (low eerie music) - What about this restructuring? - Well, thinking about going another two grand per job. You want me to stitch it up? - What do you reckon? - You just keep it in perspective. Supply and demand, nothing more. (upbeat music) - The price high glams, you're not running a bloody gay bar here, get a move on. - You ladies choke on these. - Give up the bastards. Tomorrow night. - Kiddies full of drugs, it's only appropriate that we should win. - Cheer up partner, you clowns might as well give up. - Avoiding again, Lambs? Can with a dent? - Give us a look at that can. - Just joking. - All right, well then you wouldn't mind swapping, aye? Ruddy drug squad, strike me, aye. - That's the trouble, cops, they don't trust nobody, all paranoid. Yeah, give me that. - Come on you pricks, let's get this show on the road. We ain't got all night. - What's the matter Chris, you got split ends or you just after a big shampoo like your partner? - It's getting late, we've got to get busy. Some little hard boys out there. - [Man] Hard and freaking fast, maybe. - Who's gonna teach him a lesson? - Think we want to spend the night with you ugly pricks. As soon as beerhunt is over, we off on a... - [All] Schlackhunt. - Careful Chris, corrupting a minor is a vice offense. - I'm thinking more along the lines of erupting right into sweet snatch. - [Man] Hey Will, we hitting the town tonight? - [Man] You can come with us if you like. - I'm not up to a hunt. - Anyway, you're coming with Bingo and me, Robbie. We got something to show you. - Threesome, very special. - You're up! - Drink the bastard. - This is how it's done. Take notes. - [Man] Jesus, you shitting me? - [Man] Remember this game, mate? - Got a bad feeling about this. - Get cracking, you're bloody homicide now. (cheering) Life's a bitch, ain't it Walshy! - Good mate, someone better shut... - Oh, I'm scared! What's the matter man, not a sore loser are you? - Shut the fuck up, Rix. - Oh yeah, that's right, I forgot, you're just a loser, period. - Shut up you fucking idiot! - Rixie, stop. - It's true, he is a fucking loser! Can't take a joke! Aw, he's never been the same since he got set up with that bitch! - You're fucking gone! - Yeah, any time you think you're good enough, Walsh! - Hey, hey, hey ease up, we're all fucking... - Rix, you fuckwit! - Oh, it's my fault, aye, I'm the bad guy! Not scared of him. - Take it easy, Rix. (yelling and groaning) (aggressive music) - Ladies, I'd like a word with you. - Piss off! - I don't think so, police! Just come over here please, ladies. We won't detain you long. - We haven't done nothing wrong. Why are you picking on us? - Get over here now! - Better do as he says, he's got a short fuse. - So, where's the party? - Well, answer the detective. (girls laughing) - There's no party. We're just on our away home. - Yeah, sure. - Come on, I know a party girl when I see one. What do you reckon, Senior? - Well, I'd say definitely, Detective. - No, we don't. - You don't? - No. - What? - Party. - Party. - Sounds good! - We'd love to party. - You got something for us? - No, we haven't got anything. - [Both Men] No? - No. - What's in here, I wonder? - Please, come on, we've got to get home. - Ho ho! Check this out, Detective. - Whoa reefer madness. - Looks like we're gonna have to haul them in, Detective. - They've got themselves in a bit of hot water all right, Senior. - Shit, it's only grass. - Mind your fucking language! - Please, come on, give us a break. I mean, we've got to get home. - It's a school night. - What do you think, Detective? Should we give them a break? - I don't know, Senior, a drug offense isn't something to turn a blind eye to. - That's serious stuff, Detective Brown. - Please. - We promise never to do it again. - They're nice girls. I like them. - They're pretty. That'll ruin their lives. - I think we should give them a break. - Thanks. - Erm, they'd have to do something for us, don't you think, Detective? - Oh, definitely, Senior. They'd have to earn their pardon. - Well, do you think they're up to it? - Sure, they're party girls. - Well, what do we have to do? - Only what comes natural to a pretty, young party girl. - Oh yeah, what's that? - Well, firstly, you gotta learn to say no to drugs. - Like in the ads, okay? - Sure. - Promise. - Okay then, say it. - Say what? - Say what Sir. - No, I want to hear you say it. - Come on. - No. - You? - No. - Good. Now get in the car. - Why? - Where are we going? - Well, we're gonna party, of course. - So get in the car. - Come on. - Now! - Well our account and go another two grand a job, what do you reckon, Mr. Childer? - What do you reckon? - So why have vice got the dogs on him? - Amongst other things, porn. - Kids? - Bloody worse, mate. He's got his fingers in more pies than Simple Simpson. - Simon, it's Simple Simon. - Fucking whatever! You're just lucky it was our shift. - Thank heavens for small mercies, hey. - Well, how small we talking about? - Well, Toni wanted to go thirds, but I figured it was your baby... - So we reckon 50%'s a fair cop. - You're a liar. - So, the less we talk and that water looked pretty thick. - Well, 50%'s about two and a half thou. (groans) But as you can see, I was thinking about closing it down. - Let's just keep those thoughts kept curbed for a while. - Yeah, let us get a few spawns in the bank, hey. - Don't you want to know what the shake down is? - Ixnay on that, my friend. - Yep. What we don't know can't hurt you. - Of course, we'll be taking our cut from this one. - Of course you will. - [Man] Everybody knows your partner fancied himself a hard one. - Jesus, you bastards are deluded. Polishing a seat all day, shuffling papers. What do you know about the job? Some pricks need the knuckle, it's the only thing they understand. (low moody music) You know, I've seen crims that would cut your head off and fuck your corpse and the next day, take your mom to church and not bat an eyelid. Look into the face like that, you look into a black hole. Some people don't deserve to live. - [Man] So, you're speaking for your partner here Detective? - Nope. You want someone to dog Detective Walsh, you get someone else. Robbie's a solid cop, he's a good friend. He gets a lot of shit because he's got a woman as a partner, but he never let that get in the way. We nailed the Creep. Whatever you do, whatever you say, you can't take that away from us. We nailed that bastard. (low moody music) - [Man] So you don't have any bad feelings towards your partner then? - Bad feelings? Robbie's my only friend. I love him. (rumbling) - That's a body all right, what do you make of it, Joe? - I think it's just some drunken bum. - My thoughts exactly. You say no one else is aware of this, Constables? - Affirmative, Sir, we made the discovery. - Sir. - Okay then, what we're going do is ignore this, doesn't exist. All right? Dead body is the last thing we want here with all this sudden market development, bad PR. So we turn a blind eye to this. It's an order, okay. - Yes, Sarge. - Yes, Sir. - What about the body, Sir? - Well, you leave that to Joe and me and Hopper. One more thing, Constables, if I ever get wind of this circulating, well, you know, it'd have to be both of you so keep buttoned up. - Sir. - Very good What the bloody hell are we going to do with the stiff? I sure as hell don't want to fish it out. - I don't know, maybe we could sink it, you know, throw rocks at it. - Good thinking. Maybe some bricks. Yeah, that's it. Let's get to it. - So, how was it for you? - You fucking asshole. - You had a choice. - Please, just let us go. - You can go anytime you want. No one's holding you. Of course, I'll be confiscating this. - I can go now? - Sure, off you go. (eerie music) Aren't we forgetting something? - What? - How bout thank you detective or words to that effect. - You can't be serious. - Oh contrere. I've never been more serious in my life. (dark moody music) Say it. Say it, you little slut! Say thank you detective. - Thank you detective. - Bless you, sweetheart. Now run along. You should catch a cab. Streets at night can be a dangerous place for young girls. (rock music) - So what are you going to recommend? That I get booted from homicide? - [Woman] Is that what you want me to recommend? - Enough mind games, I'm asking you, do you think I should quit homicide? - [Woman] No, you asked me whether I was going to have you pulled. That's a very diff... - Oh, come on, Rose! - No, you come on! Look at me. Look at me. We've made some substantial progress in these sessions. I'm not going to let that slide. You nearly lost it in that autopsy and now you're losing trust in me. - Some progress. These guys got me right back when I started. - I'd like you to take some time off. I can draft a letter for the committee, it won't impact on your file. It'll just be a... - No, no fucking way. If I don't nail this man now while I've got another chance then I think I've had it. - You still think that'll solve your problems? Vengeance is not... - Stuff up theories! You know that's the only way I'm ever going to be free. - We'd all like to see this one behind bars. - Yeah. - For now I'm going to give you a clean bill, but I want to see you in my office every week. You understand? - Thanks mate. - So, Detective, how's it going? - Hello Andrew. - What've you got there? Just a couple of returns. - Couple of returns, right. I can put them straight under the counter. Don't want them straying, winding up in a Lion King box or something like that, hey. Geez, perish the thought. How much do I owe ya? - 40's fine. - Cheaper's twice the price. - I'll just check out some of your videos. - Sir! Detective, is it true what they're saying? That nutcase Mr. Freak's back in action. - Don't believe everything you see on TV. Oh sure, I'm not gullible, but that kid dead sounds awful familiar. Everyone reckons it's him, mate. - We're currently investigating similarities in various cases. - I knew it, I knew you'd be involved in it, Jesus! Homicide, hey, who'd want to be anything but a homicide cop in pursuit of the ultimate crime, the theft of a human life. - You've been watching too many videos, Andrew. What's this then? - Oh yeah, it's top movie, that. You're going to love that, action, humor, good story. - Okay then. - You know, I've got some ideas how you might catch this freak. You interested? - Do I have a choice? - Detective, what time is it. No, I'll tell you. It's the late 20th century and the whole world revolves around one thing. Any ideas? No? Information. Multimedias, Internets, super highways. And the key to everything is contained in one word. You know what it is? - I'm sure I will in a minute. - Database. - Well, it's two words, anyhow, that's where it's at, that's where you'll find him. You can bet he's watching plenty of videos. All you've got to do is gather the data from the major chains, which shouldn't be too hard for the cops, and look for the indicators, you know, and rental habits. I mean, what was Frank Vikovich watching? What about Julian Night's Rambo vintage. Five in my lap, what's his bag? What about Patrick Bateman? - Who the hell's Patrick Bateman? - You know, American psycho, this completely sick book about psycho killer in New York. He rented Body Double 29 times. You know the Brian Depalma movie? Sick movie. Anyway, he watched this one sequence over and over again, where the husband, he's the killer, has got the wife on the floor and he's got this giant drill, okay, and this guy, the hero, is downstairs trying to get to her. This dog from hell's got him by the arm and he's on the floor and he's hearing the drilling, looking up at the ceiling, right. Meanwhile, the husband is over the wife and she's screaming her fucking tits off, right, and then the husband drills the poor bitch right through the heart! (growls) The drill thrusts through the ceiling. He's too late! Blood, guts, she's history. - Yeah, okay, that's really good, but (indistinct speech). - You mark my words. That's where you find this freak, in the video database, watching the sickest videos he can. Like a cancer eating his brain, getting sicker by the minute. - Yeah, that's good, look Andrew I'll see you in a couple of days. - Yeah, see ya detective. You gonna love that movie! - Sure. (rock music) - I'm gonna take a slash. - Well, don't piss on the floor. - Mate, when I hang it out, it hangs inside the rim. - In your dreams. Jane, this is the best food I've had since, well, since the last time we got together. - Yeah, that was great Jane, thanks. - You aiming for China? - How's it going, Bing? - I've been better. - Heard got problems with Ruth. - Ruth? - Fuck, haven't you heard, we're history. - No, no one told me. Yeah, another one bites the dust. I guess we're all single again, hey. - Single? If God wanted cops to have lasting relationships, he wouldn't have given them... - What? Wouldn't have given then what? (coughs) - Aye? - Give me this spongehead. - I'm sorry, mate. - Yeah, me too. Anyway, she was a bitch. Someone else was snaking her pussy on the side. - At least he can laugh about it, hey. - Yeah, now. It was a pain in the ass for a while. - Oh really? Anyhow, that's nothing compared to what's gonna go down. (man farts) Christ, what is your fucking problem? - [Man] You shoulda been a fireman, not a cop. - What's gonna go down? - You know we've been be smack vesting Kazan. - Yeah. - Well the key collar... - My stooge when he speaks. - Uh oh. - Wa wow. - Guess what? He ain't going down quietly. What's that? - [Man] He's telling me that Chris's dog got a hold of our drugs. - Yeah, so I heard. - When did you hear? - Last week. - Why didn't you tell me? - Didn't want to worry you. - Jesus Robbie. - Anyhow, we heard you had a sock last week. - Well don't look at me. - Why don't you give homicide the ass. Get into drugs or fraud, somewhere with a bit less baggage. - Not to mention a bit more spondoola. - There's no profit in stiffs. - Getting out as the best thing we ever did. - Did you put them up to this? - Get outta here, we're concerned. All three of us. - Remember last time? You barely got through it, mate. - We heard about the autopsy, Jane. You're too close. You can't watch a kid bang bone... - And feel nothing... - Then you gotta get out. - The writings on the wall. As plain as a nose on your face. - You finished? - Yeah. - Had our say. - Good, let's leave it at that then, shall we? - Okay. - It's left. - Back there. - Way behind. - I'll get dessert. - Heads up, Pencil. How's life in showbiz? - Detectives. When are you doing I here tonight? It's not Wednesday is it? - Oh, we were just passing Nicholas and we thought we'd drop in. - Why aren't you happy to see us? - No, no, no, I'm always happy to see you guys. - Pigs ass. What are you up to? Check the app and go. - Hey, I don't want to trouble walk. Oh, come on, Ms. Johnson, look, you know, it's like a special night tonight and that, and I just don't want no trouble and stuff. Hey, I've got to pick up if you want it. You can take some more this... - Settle down, mate. - Hey careful! - Spider mineral bastard! (both yelling at once) You dirty little asshole! - Come on, I'm begin' ya. - Is this how you respect our trust? I'm pulling the tape and go, we're gonna ream all these freaks! - No, no, starts with money. - How much? - A grand. (head thuds) (groans) - You can do better than that. - That's all I've got, it's honest. - Well, it's not near enough to buy you out of this, you're miserable little shit. - Okay, okay information, I can give you some information. - Make it quick. - All right, okay, how bout some dope on that kid killer? You know, Mr. Creep. Are you interested? - Yeah, thought so. - What do you know? - One of our clients reckons that he knows this guy, you know this, Mr. Creep or whatever the fuck he's called. - One of your clients. Don't jerk my chain, you little bastard! - Come on, it's honest mate, he's a lawyer or something, you know, he's no bullshitter. He knows the guy. - Shut up, we've heard it all before! - Straight up, straight up, Mr. Wright, straight up! Okay, he says he knows things, you know, that he does to the kids and stuff. Things, you know, that only the cops know. - Such as? - Is this information good enough for you? You know, you're going to give us a break? - Get to the pay off and we'll let you know. So... - Yeah? (both yelling at once) He bites 'em, okay? He says he bites their little titties off. (body thudding) Hey, I'm right aren't I! See, I told ya! - Who's this client? What's his fucking name? - Hey, you're gonna give us a break, you know? Like, is the info good enough for ya? - We'll still be taking the grand. Get it! (groans) (yells) - Jesus mate, who picked this bloody film? - Andrew from the video shop. (both laughing) - Shut up. (beeping) - Shit. - Thought we were gonna turn those things off. - No, that's mine. - It's not mine. 014818381 urgent. (indistinct speech) - Bloody foreigner. What does she want? - Hi, Ton. Yeah, hi, it's me man, just got your message, what's up? Yeah. Jesus, how good is it? Okay. All right. Yeah, bye. (dark moody music) Jesus, Robbie. We got a red hot on the Creep. - Listen, I want to see my lawyer, I know know my rights. You can't haul me in like this like one of your scum. Dickheads. Gonna have you up on charges. You hear me, your history! - You watch your language, Mr. De Leon or we'll detain you longer. We just need bit of help with a few inquiries. - A few inquiries, gee, you're a bit of a comedian, aren't you? Well, I'm going to have you sacked from the force. How would you like that, Mr. Funnyman? - De Leon, that's a well name, isn't it, Detective? - Sounds like it to me. You a bit of a spic, Mr. De Leon? You look a little on the greasy side. - Jesus Christ, racist patter as well. Gee, you must be talking top men. Where'd you learn the ropes, Boys Academy 6? - We'll let the judge see. Or should I say Allesandro. That's your real first name, isn't it, Mr. De Leon? - Yes, so what? - What else you hiding? - What other dark little secrets you got, aye, Allesandro? - I want to say my lawyer. What about my rights? - Fuck your rights, you're a prick, you don't have any. - Oh, I am so scared. Gonna piss my pants from fright. - Looks like we got us a tough guy, Detective. So nothing phases you, aye, Allesandro? - We know you're a chickenhawk, Alles or whatever your name is. - Mate, what are you talking about? - We know all about your little secret. You like to rape little boy, aye? The younger the better, you chicken old pervert. - Mate, what are you talking about? - [Man] Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, hey Detective. - You been fingered, sucker. - You're a law breaker. - A dick sucker. - And you're going down, my friend. - No way, you bastards got nothing on me. I want to see my lawyer. - So who is he? - Mate... (fist thuds) - Get a grip, ass fuck, now we know you know who he is! - Just tell us who he is Alan, we're not interested in you. - Listen to me, I want my lawyer, hear me. I want my fucking lawyer! (moody music) - This'll be sticky if they don't come back with something. - Yeah, I fucking know. - I'd like to beat it out of the prick. - Yeah, well fucking go for it. Just make sure I'm outta here before you do it. Not risking it for that piece of shit. - What do you think about this Creep connection? - Come on, Rob. He saw the spruker. You're shitting me if you reckon that'll stand up against a suit. - Here we go. - Check out these goodies from the nest. This should get him shitting. - Don't bet on it. He clammed up as soon as we mentioned Creep. He'll only talks lawyer. - We'll get on a roll on these. - Inadmissible evidence, not to mention a shit load of trouble for us. - Search and seizure sends warrant. - Wouldn'tve break reigns with that. (man screams) - Oh, that's good, he's getting edgy. - How far you gonna go? - All the way if I have to. Robbie, you in or out? - In JJ, I said I'm going all the way. - Boys? - I reckon we've come about as far as we can on this one. What do you reckon, Chris? - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah, we'll take it from me. - Let's piss off. - So how do you want to play it? - I'm on this. - Of course you are. - Come on you piece, I've been here for bloody hell! What's going on! - Okay, okay, calm down. - [JJ] Please sit down, Mr. De Leon. We won't be keeping you too much longer. I'm sorry about the delay. - Oh, bitch as well now huh? What's a matter of funny, man, can't handle the pace? (thuds) - Sit down, please. - That's a fucking assault, asshole. Gee, you pricks are really shit. I'm going to love suing you for everything you've got. - What about something you've got? - What's that? - You tell us. - I don't know. - Sure you do. I found it under the Baroque four-poster, very tacky. - Wait a minute, you've been to my house? - We had a warrant. - That's shit, you bastards. I can't believe it, you invaded my privacy! - I'd like to know the name of the man known as Mr. Creep. Now, we know you know him, just tell us Alan and it'll save us a whole lot of grief. - I want my lawyer! - You scumbag or I'll charge you with possessing indecent materials! - So fine me, you slut. I want my lawyer. (low moody music) - Cuff him, Detective. - What are you doing? Fuck! What the fuck's going on? - Can you get me a cup of coffee, Detective? Nothing for the prisoner. - What the fuck's going on? What the fuck are you doing? Fucking bitch! (tape scratches) What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Let me go! (low moody music) (man groans) - Perhaps I can jog your memory, Mr. De Leon. (groans) (rattling) - [Man] See it? Something surfaced. - [Woman] Got him. - Sort of hovering like a jellyfish. See, Jerry? - Been in the drink for weeks by the look. - Ain't this fine bloody state of affairs. - [Man] Looks like none of us are interested in pulling that bastard out. - [Woman] What do you reckon? - Can I make a suggestion? - Yeah. - How bout, we ignore the prick. - What, can we do that? - Mate, we're cops. We can do anything we like. - Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna complain. - Or blab? - No bloody way. - Okay, let's just leave the poor prick to the fishes and get the fuck out of here. - Hang on a sec, it's floating around the ship. Someone's bound a spot it sooner or later. - That's easy fix. (gun fires) - What the fuck are you doing? - Just letting down it's tires. He'll sink like a stone. - Never saw it, out of mind. (gun fires) (phone rings) - Homicide. Speaking. (fingers snapping) - [Man] I don't know what you think you're doing, Detective. - We're doing our job, Sir. - [Man] Don't hand me that bullshit. You intimidated one of my key stooges. Now he's backed out, you're in deep shit. - Is this is why you called us, to tell us something we already know? - [Man] Back off or it'll be worse for you, understand? - Is that a threat, Detective? - [Man] That's a promise, Detective. - We've got our own investigation. - [Man] You're barking up the wrong bloody tree on that one, Missy. - As far as I'm concerned, we're this close to landing the Creep and I'm going to keep barking until he goes down, understand? Hello? - [Man] De Leon will be finding a soft chat and I'll be liaison with IAD direct. You're the one who's gonna go down, you stupid cow. (dark moody music) - So what do you reckon about that? - Aye. What do I reckon about what. - Oh come on, he's shit scared, it's bloody him! - You heard the prick, we're in deep shit. - We've nailed that bastard. - With what? There's no proof. - Oh no? Read it and weep, my friend. He's been interstate for two years. Get this, from July '92 to April '93 in Perth, then Brisbane. He's been back two months. The similars correspond to his time in both of those places. - I reckon he's working on some sort of covert we don't know about. - No, that first kid in Perth, September '92, a couple of months after he's posted. - Nah, there's got to be some explanation for it. - Oh come on Robbie, it all fits, the Melbourne activities, the interstate similars happening when Brown was in the vicinity. We know the Creep's forensic smart, and he always seems one step ahead, like he knows what's going on, like he's got inside information. - I reckon the prick's getting brown up, some sort of payback. Jesus, we've seen that before. - No, De Leon knows too much. He could have only got it from the horse's mouth. - Brown's our ranking officer. Of course he'd know about the Creep withelds. I reckon he's working on a case, maybe some sort of chickenhawk bust and he's told De Leon. (dark moody music) - You don't know him, do you? - How do I know him? - You worked a couple of the Creeps, thought you might've come across him. - No fucking way, I never fucking met him. - You're doing a great job of sticking up for him. - All I'm saying is what internal will say. This is dished up to them. - What do you mean if? - Well, even if it's true, I mean, how are we ever going to prove it? - I don't need any more proof. Look, if it comes to it, are you in or out? - Are you out of your fucking mind? (dark moody music) Well, you're on your own on this one. From now on it's every man for himself, you hear me? - Jesus, what took you so long, aye? Takes the cuff off, will ya? - Just get in, mate. - Uncuff me. (thuds) (groans) - That Creep busted my fucking ribs. Fucking worked me over in that shit hole. Have you seen me? - Don't worry about it, we'll have a little chat, we'll work it out. - We're gonna to and get some more mates, we're gonna fucking show him, aye. Bust his fucking arm, bust his fucking legs. Who's that prick, that fucking Rix. Fucking asshole, mate. - Shut the up, Ronnie! (Ronnie mumbles) - Take the light then straight there. - She's suffering from a sense of personal responsibility. It's not uncommon in cases such as these. - First time I've heard of it. - It's not uncommon for a member, believing they're supposed to be one of the few people in a position to identify a perpetrator, to feel a substantial burden of guilt when that perpetrator continues offending. Burden grows exponentially with each new offense. - Yes, yes, can we cut to the chase please Doctor, your recommendations? - I can only recommend in the light of current events, that Detective Wilson be given a substantial period of time off as soon as possible and as far away from work as possible. - So Wilson, it looks like it's settled. - It looks like it. - Don't be a smart ass with me, Detective! You're a buoy stick away from a suspension, understand? - Yes, sir. - I'll call in some of your leave and you can keep your bloody head down till this whole thing blows over. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - All right then, I'll have your Freddy and your service issue. - So I am suspended, sir. - Oh, I've kept it off your record, but for all intents and purposes, you're out until further notice. Your Freddy and your gun now, Detective. (clattering) Tell Detective Walsh to come in your way out. - Give us a moment. - Gotta get some pain killers, man. You're a big guy man, you really fucking worked me. I think I busted a reman. - Jesus. (thuds) (groans) You fucking idiot. Two ounces, two fucking ounces. - Mr. Hill, fuck! Oh, I didn't notice. Fuck, I thought it was small tore man, I was set up! You know me, I was fucking set up! - Fuck yeah you were set up for 10 years without parole, that's what, mate. - Hey, nah, nah, nah, I can't go to Pentridge man, oh, I won't last 10 minutes in that place, man. You're going to get me off, you fucking owe me! - Mate, listen to me. You're going to go down on this one, mate. - No mate, no. - Listen to me, I'm not fucking kidding with you here. I can get a sentence reduction. I can pull a few strings mate, but you're not getting out of this one, it's too big. - Fuck me, after all I done for you, man, I put my fucking life on the line for you. You know they'll fix me inside, mate. But you know I'd do it If I could, you know that. This is too big. You got to take the knocky. You got to take the knock. That's the only way, mate. Hey. - Well, you're coming down with me fucker. - No, no, I don't want to hear that, Ronnie. Ronnie, I've looked after you, mate. - Yeah, well fuck it's a two-way street! I'm gonna protect myself here! I'm gonna protect myself! - Look at me! Look at me. Be real smart here, be real fucking smart. - No, what about me? - I'll look after you, mate. But you've got to go down here. - What about me! What about me! What about my girl, what about my kid! I gotta think of myself, you understand! You fuck! - Don't worry about it, mate. I understand, mate. Here mate. Pick it up. Pick it up. Drop it! - Motherfucker. - Put the fucking... (gun fires) - Chris, give us your gun! Give us your fucking gun. - We bought him back to the crime scene. He said he was going to reveal pertinent information, okay. He had a stook over there on the wall, pulled out a gun, ignored our warnings and we opened fire. (gun fires) (yells) - Chris! (slow moody music) - Can I come in? - What's up? - Don't get upset, Robbie asked me to drop in. He's worried about you, we all are, - About me or what I might say to IRD? - Shit Jane, there's no need for that. - You can tell them not to worry. I'm not a dog. This is a whole other thing. - Look, don't sweat about Brown. Vice had been trailing him for months. We've dug enough to bury the prick. - As the Creep? - No, he's a bent cop, not a psycho. We haven't seen anything like that. - You haven't been trailing him close enough. - Jane, I know what it's like when the devil's on your back, sooner or later, you'll do anything to shake it off, but you've got to your perspective. (laughs) - Jesus, what fucking manual did you get that from? - I'm in the job too, mate. - Look, I'm sorry Toni, I didn't mean it. I'm on edge, okay. Look, I know you're worried about me and I appreciate it. I really do. - Us girls have got to stick together. I better go. Hang in there, all right. - Robbie doesn't know him, does he? - What did he say? - Forget it. I'll see you around. (dark moody music) - [Woman] Pending arraignment on drug charges was released into the custody of two detectives and was subsequently shot dead while trying to escape. - They friends of yours, aren't there Walshy? - Robbie, looks like you'll have some company in the dog house, hey. (men laughing) - Get stuffed. - Oh, by the way, JJ called yesterday. Wanted some (indistinct speech). Guess she's still working, is she - Can't keep a good cop down, my friend. - Did you give her any? - Of course. - All Creeps. SIC9-1, - 3, -4. - The dismembered one? - Yeah. - What the fuck she want to watch that for? - I've gotta go. - Don't you want to count it? - He trusts me. - Well, thata be a first. Besides, you never made that tip off, right? - What tip off? - We haven't spoken to Wilson in weeks. - [Man] Beautiful. - Eh, it'll probably count to nothing. Robbie reckons he can contain her. - Yeah, but just in case he can't, we've got to be prepared and we can count on you guys here. - Mate, if she rolls, I haven't rolled in shit. - Don't even think about it. (sirens blaring) - So what do you reckon about Hill, aye? - Jesus I mean, that took some balls. - Shit yeah, we did not see that one coming. - No? You guys fitted him up. - He'd been warned about muscling into Brown's business. - Yeah, he's got no one to blame but himself. - Oh, okay, okay, keep your shirt on. - Hill a cop a little bit of grief, but nothing he can't handle. - Spence was scum. I'm not giving a shit about him. - [Man] Believe me, the world is a better place without that maggot. - Father's coming through, hey? - Have you ever thought that there might be something to what Wilson's saying? - No fucking way. - Brown is a businessman, not a fucking child killer. - [Man] Anyway, we're all making far too much money to have time to hear that sort of bullshit. - And on that note... - Cheery bye. (rock music) (indistinct telephone voice) - Every D's got a moment. Mine was on Creep case. The second one, Frankie Dawson. I'd been to autopsies before. I'd had my fair share of highway meat shows, you know. But Frankie was my moment. We got a sniff that maybe the body had been stashed out on this farm, so we went out for a look-see. Just another follow up in a long list. He'd been gone two months. I'm walking across this yard and suddenly I'm looking at myself walking across this yard and I'm thinking this is like a dream. It was like I was just watching. Over in the corner was this drum, this 44 gallon drum, about this high and there was smoke coming out of it, coming out of the holes in it space under the lid. (ominous music) I'm walking towards it thinking, Jesus, there's a fire in there. I'm walking towards it, knowing something's going to happen. But on the ground, I'm just thinking there's a fire in there. I can hear the crackling and the flames burning. I grabbed a stick because I know the lid's gonna be hot. And I knock off the lid and all this smoke comes pouring out, this sick, black smoke pumping out into the air. The smoke clears a little, I'm moving my head in for a look at the fire and I'm thinking this smoke's alive and it's not smoke. It's flies. And then I see Frankie. His little face all blotchy-black, puffy. And he's blinking up at the light. He's squinting up in the light. His face is moving and he's trying to say something, it's maggots, and he's trying to say something to me. The next thing I know I'm lying flat on my back, sickle down my front and Robbie standing over me, saying it's all right, it's all right. And he's mopping up the sick. He's cleaning me up like a mother, saying it's all right Jane, it's all right. Every day, every single day I see Frankie's face. And I know what he's saying, he's saying help me. His black little mouth is saying help me Jane. - Gonna need your pigs for this one, fellas. - Oh, Jesus, don't tell me. - Ripe and ready to burst. - Shit! Well off you go then. - Ah, the chain of command, it's a beautiful thing. - You're not wrong. (groaning) (men laughing) - [Man] Considerable spread a blood of a bit setting in. Jesus, what's that, Detective? - Heart, liver, bit of other stuff. - [Man] Is that the body? - [Man] It's kind of everywhere, bottom half's in the kitchen. - [Man] Fucking shit. (low eerie music) - [Man] Bottom half's in the kitchen. - [Man] Shit. They'll find the face. - What a mess. - Camera. (suspenseful music) - Who's there? - Senior Detective Brown. - Yeah, do I know you? - We've spoken before on the telephone, Detective Wilson from homicide. - If you are here about those fucking charges forget it. I'm going to have your fucking ass! What you did was despicable! - You are guilty of the abductions and murders of five children in the Melbourne metropolitan area. You are guilty of the abductions and murders of three children in the cities of Perth and Brisbane in the two year period just gone. - You wearing a wire. Is this what this is about, is it? Hello? I deny everything this stupid has said. Is that happy, happy levels for the wire? You stupid fucking cow, I'm going to have your fucking ass. You're gone! - The sentence is death. - What? (Brown laughs) (guns clicking) Stupid fucking bitch, you really are fucking stupid! (gun fires) (low suspenseful music) (gun fires) (heavy breathing) (grunts) Stupid cow. You really think you were gonna get me? (JJ groans) (coughs) Stupid fucking cow. (thuds) (grunts) To this, you think you're gonna get me, aye! See what you fucking did to me! (thuds) (groans) You think you're gonna help from your partner? He's my partner, he's in deep into me! (thuds) (groans) (coughs) (Brown groans) (distant sirens blaring) - Come on Jane, we gotta go! What? What? - You knew. - Just business to me, Jane. You gotta understand that! You owe me favors now. Put it down. Put it down. It's just you and me, Jane, just you and me. (sirens blaring) (crying) You haven't got the guts. (tires squealing) (sirens blaring) (gun fires) (moody music)
