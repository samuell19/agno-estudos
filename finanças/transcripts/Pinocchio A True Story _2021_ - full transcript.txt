Hmm? Oh! You're already here! Well, in that case, greetings, noble signores and signorinas, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and, of course, their pets! The story I'm about to tell you is mysterious and full of great wonders. You may have heard that once upon a time, a man named Geppetto carved a puppet out of wood. But then, people started making up some silly stories about growing noses and whatnot. Tell me, have you ever seen a nose grow right in front of you? Here's an idea. Why don't you make yourselves comfortable, and I'll tell you all about what really happened to the wooden boy? Sound good? Then here we go! There you go. You can sit at the table... ...and I won't feel so lonely. I will think of you as my own son. All right? Now, what should we name you? Giuseppe? Eh... No. I know a guy by that name. He's my neighbor. A drunk with a red nose. Maybe Leonardo? That won't do either. He'd grow up to be a selfish actor, or an artist, or a turtle who only cares about pizza. Let's see. Your name will be... Pinocchio! Ahem. Personally, I find his appearance rather dull. Don't you agree, my dear Geppetto? I understand I might be a boring companion, but you could have made a more joyful and intelligent puppet. Tibalt, you're probably the only talking horse in the world. I was glad to invite you to my home. But I don't think it gives you the right to criticize this fine work! Hmm... That's probably the guest I've been waiting for. Well, and look who's got upset here. These artists can be so sensitive. There you go, my pretty signora Lyusilda. I've fixed your wand, just like you asked. Thank you very much, Geppetto, my dear old friend. You truly are exceptionally gifted! What can I ever do to repay you? From you, signora, a mere "thank you" is more than enough. That really is all I need. In that case, from the bottom of my heart, thank you again. - It was very nice seeing you. - Bye-bye! Well, Caro? Should we surprise our dear old friend? Of course! I know it will be... No. This time, we'll do something more interesting and magical! Hmm? Oh. Huh. What's that sound? Or is it my ears ringing again? Oh! Pinocchio! What happened, my boy? Let's get you back up. That's better. Huh? Pinocchio?! Son?! Alive?! I don't believe my eyes! Oh... Alive! I'm a boy and I'm alive! Lyusilda... And what do you think will come of all this? Trust me, Caro. At least this will make for an extremely interesting story. Hup. Hup! Hup! Ha! Hi... yah! Good job, Tibalt! Hit it again! Now let's try it like this. Hup! Hup! Hup! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Ah! Pinocchio! Son! Yee-haw! Ta-da! Be careful! Don't hurt yourself! Dad, don't worry, I can't hurt myself. You told me I was made of high-quality materials. Yes, but... Don't you worry, signore Geppetto! I've got everything under control. And that is what I'm afraid of, Tibalt. Greetings, my good gentlemen. My name is Geppetto. May I ask who I am speaking with today? I am Brioni, Detective Constable. Have you seen anyone suspicious around here lately? No one but you, Detective Brioni. It's not a joke! It's a very serious matter. We are looking for tough criminals! Hmm? I assure you, there is no one here like that. And you don't find that little fact suspicious? What little fact? You don't think it's suspicious that there's no one suspicious in your home? Absolutely not, Detective. In that case, you won't mind if we see for ourselves. - Let's start with the stables. - Detective, please wait... Excuse me, but it is your job to wait, and my job is to investigate! Yes! And that's exactly what I'll do. Did you hear that? Follow me! Pinocchio! Tibalt! Are you here? Whew! That was really close! I was sure that detective was about to find you! It's okay, Dad, don't worry. Even if they find me, I can always pretend to be a tree stump. Father, tell me, when can I leave to be on my own? I've got the whole world to see. I want to meet other people. Not any time soon, Pinocchio. You're too unusual for this world. If I were in your boots, I'd use the word "special" instead. Yes, thank you, Tibalt. He's right. You are too special, Pinocchio. You're too young and too gullible. The world is full of people who could harm you. I promise I will let you go. Believe me, son. But only when the time is right. Time sure takes its sweet time. Maybe time just got lost on its way here. Come on, Tibalt! Let's see what it was! Pinocchio, wait! Stop it, I say! Enough with the shooting already! We have important matters to discuss! Our last few shows barely had any audience. I say we just need to come up with a new act. Well, I'm open for suggestions! Heh! All right. Here's an idea. We'll turn off all the lights, and I'll crawl between the seats, grabbing the audience by their feet. Nonsense! That won't do. It will just scare everyone off. How about this? I will shoot the audience, and the Fox will be catching the bullets with his teeth. Huh? What? I will shoot blanks, of course, and you will hold bullets in your mouth. No! What if I choke on one of the bullets? Come on! Do you seriously think someone is willing to pay to be shot at? Well, you asked for suggestions! Meow! Huh? - Stop them! - Bella, where are you going?! - Yes, Bella, where are you going? - Save my daughter! Why does my father want me to stay home all the time, Tibalt? He's just worried about you, my boy. You can't deny you really are special. Besides, the police have been sniffing around lately. Yeah, you're probably right. But, you know, what about my dream? - You have a dream? - Yes, Tibalt! I have a special, most treasured dream! Huh?! - Oh? - Wait! Go on! Go on! Wait, Bella! Stop! The coach is headed for the cliff! She's gonna fall! Pinocchio, it's not our problem. But we at least have to try saving her! Go! Jump, Bella! Jump! Jump! Don't worry! Jump off the carriage! Don't jump, Bella! You can break your leg and you won't be able to perform! - Ow! - Oh! So do I jump or not? Hold on, Bella! Signorina! Signorina, I'm here to help! Hmm? Alley-oop! Come on, we need to turn left! That's it! Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa! I got you! - Whoa! - Good horsey! Horsey, go left! Go left! Whoa, ho, ho! Close call! Close call! Stop! Time to stop! Signorina! Are you okay there? I am, thanks to you! I'm Bella. And may I know the name of my savior? My name is Pinocchio. Huh? Bella, I don't get it. Have you been rescued without us? My greetings, sir. Mamma mia! A wooden boy! Pinocchio! What have you done? You Killed him! Pinocchio, are you all right?! I, uh... I think I'm okay. What are you shooting at, furbrains?! He's a talking wooden puppet! He's a monster! Well, my friend might be made of wood, but someone here has sausages for brains. And that leaves one question... who's the real monster here?! What? I thought... I heard shots! How come?! Father, this noble young man here saved my life. Well, in that case, I think you deserve a... I can't believe my eyes! Are you... you... made of wood? Here we go! Huh! First they shoot him, and now they knock on him like he's a door. Here's an idea, sir. Why don't you do us all a favor and keep those hands of yours to yourself? Bellissimo! - Guys, I really need this one. - But what for, boss? Yeah, what for? Have you seen him ride that horse? No reins at all! And he's made of wood! Fantastic! He is exactly what we need! People will swarm to our circus! Pinocchio, they call me signore Mangiafuoco. But for you, just Papa Giafo. Have you ever thought about... hmm... joining a circus? A circus? Yes! You seem like a talented rider. You were born to be shining in the arena! Ha! You will become a star, my boy! Everyone will know your name. You will travel the world! - What? - Thank you, but we're not interested. Please excuse us, we need to get going. Hmm... Hmm! Of course you will be a star, because you already have such a marvelous talent agent! Um... signore... The name's Tibalt... Hmm... signore Tibalt, the talent agent. Actually, it does have a nice ring to it. You know... Maybe it's not such a bad idea after all! Signore Mangiafuoco, thank you so much for the generous offer, but well, I'm sorry, I have to talk to my father first. His-his name is Geppetto. Well... of course you do. Go ahead and talk to him. But hurry. Fortune, my friend, waits around for no one. I promise I'll be back in no time! Let's hurry home, Tibalt! We have to talk to Father. Pinocchio, I'll be waiting! Dad, you have to let me go! Please! I'll go to the city, I'll do one performance, and I'll be back home. Yes! And I promise I'll be there to look after him at all times. And before you know it, we'll be there and back. Dad, I can make a lot of money. We will build a new house! At least a new workshop for you! I don't need money. I just need you, Pinocchio. Well, your own home should never feel like a prison. You can go. Thank you, Daddy! I knew you wouldn't say no. Let's go, Tibalt! Great adventures await! See you later, my dear Geppetto! Just be careful, my son! Bye, Daddy! Bye-bye! It looks like a carriage went by here. Several carriages, in fact. This is very suspicious. Where did they go? This way? Or maybe that way? We don't know, Detective Brioni. Of course you don't know, knuckleheads! You've stomped all over the tracks! You both are no use at all! I always have to do everything myself! Okay, maybe I should toss a coin. That's always worked. Hmm... Heads. So this means the suspects must have gone... That way! Follow me! Welcome! Welcome to our town! Circus! Circus is here! - What do you think? - Amazing! I just love it here so much! You haven't seen anything yet, Pinocchio. Tonight, I promise you, you will be a witness to something truly marvelous, something you won't soon forget. Alley-oop! Signori and signorinas! Ladies and gentlemen! Tonight, we present to you a never-before-seen, one-of-a-kind performance! If it's anything like last year, - I want my money back! - Just awful! But first, right in front of you, our marksman will shoot an apple off my head! This is not for the faint-hearted! Drumroll, please? Oops. As you can see, the first attempt failed. Let's try this! Well, no apple is a match for this marksman! I want my money back! I've seen this before! People are unhappy! We have to fix this immediately. Pinocchio, get ready! You're up next! I am? Yes! And hurry up! And you two, make yourselves useful for once. Ladies and gentlemen! Please allow me to present to you the discovery of the season! The world's one and only, unique talking puppet! Pinocchio! And his horse, Tibalt! Show us what you've got! Come on! Okay, come on, come on. - Show us what you've got, come on! - Come on! This wooden oaf will ruin our whole performance. If he doesn't start doing something, I'll kick him out of my circus! I know you can do it. What is that blockhead doing? How much longer do we have to wait?! Pinocchio, I think it's time to start our act. - Entertain us! - Come on! Pinocchio... - Pinocchio! - Yeah? It's time, you're right. He did it! It's my success! Bella, go upstairs and start getting ready. Mm-hmm. Bravo! Woo-hoo! Well done, boy! Bravo! Bravissimo! Fantozzi, you're up next. And this time, try not to keep them waiting! My boy! Let me tell you, you outdid yourself! Congratulations and welcome to our gang... Oh, excuse me, I mean, welcome to Papa Giafo's circus troupe. Signore Tibalt, I think now it's about time we discuss our contract terms. Mm, yes, I would think so. What time frame are we talking about? Pinocchio promised his father that he'll be home soon. Why don't we do, uh, the road tour first? And we'll see how it goes. But now, please excuse me. I have to announce our next performer. Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, I present to you... - Tibalt... - Fantozzi! ...I promise we'll go back to my father as soon as we see the world and we make some money at least. But for now, since you're my talent agent, you can take his place. What? You want me to be your father? Well, this is somewhat unexpected. To be honest, Pinocchio, I never thought of our relationship as a father-son dynamic. And besides, I'm too young to be a parent, so to say. Just say yes. I promise I'll be a good son. Well, all right. Let's say I do agree. - But there will be conditions. - Name them. - You'll do everything exactly as I say. - That's fair. - I have to know where you are 24/7. - Consider it done. And if you're bad, you'll be grounded till I say otherwise. Ha! Yeah, right. In your dreams! But how else am I supposed to teach you things? Well, how do I know? It's you that's the parent, not me. And now, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for the ultimate crown jewel of our troupe! She's delightful, she's fascinating, performer extraordinaire... Bella!

Well, well, well. Something tells me that I might have seen this poster before. You sure have, Detective. This is Mangiafuoco's traveling circus. Yeah, they're touring small towns and villages. They came here yesterday. Hmm... Interesting. Something to think about. Do you know what any detective's first job is? What, Detective? You knuckleheads! A detective's first job is to think! Hmm.

I mean, well, you're not exactly right. I did want to see the world. But as soon as I met her, I realized she is the most beautiful thing the world has to offer. Hmm... Alrighty, then. So what do you intend to do about it? What do you mean? What can I do? I mean, you have to do something. Give her some flowers, or invite her for a walk on the beach. Just look how beautiful it is out there. The moon and the stars, twinkling in the water. Boats rolling gently by the shore. And all the cafés are closed, so you won't have to buy her ice cream. You have no reason to be afraid, Pinocchio! Trust me, it's better to regret things you've done than regret things you've never tried. Really? I don't want to cross any lines. But what happens if she says no to me? Either you go and talk to her, or we go back home. I'm not going to spend my life waiting for you to make up your mind. All right... I'll go. It's just...

Not to spoil everything! N-n-no worries, boss. You can count on both of us. What if he leaves and goes back home? Don't worry, he won't. Apparently, he has a crush on Bella, so he's not going anywhere. Who's there? It's just me. Pinocchio, you need to listen to me. I have to tell you something. I'm here to tell you something too. Let me go first, Pinocchio. You're a great guy, that's true. But it's better if you leave before something terrible happens! You want me to leave the circus? Trust me, it will be better this way. You have to leave as soon as possible! - But... - No buts! Get out! Leave! I don't even like you! Oh, flowers. Who are those for, I wonder? I might have some insight. It looks like our wooden Romeo here is in love with Bella. That's hilarious! What? Hold on, fellow. That's the funniest thing I heard today! Did you seriously think that you and Bella...? Oh... Time for a reality check, Pinocchio. That's what friends are for, right? Bella is the boss's daughter. It won't be long before she becomes a beautiful young signorina. And you, my friend, will always be nothing but a wooden puppet. A special talking puppet... But a puppet nonetheless. Tibalt, faster! - Woo-hoo-hoo! - Oh! Oh! Yipee! Pinocchio! Yep! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, giddyup! I should never have let him go by himself. But he said it was his dream! Well... It's time for me to stop sitting around and go find my boy! Wherever you are, Pinocchio, I hope you're all right. Pinocchio? Hmm? Is something wrong? You told me I should ask Bella out. Well, I did, and you know what answer she gave me? What? Get out! Well, so what? You have to learn to take no for an answer. Not a big deal. It's a normal part of life. Normal, you said? You want to see something that's far from normal? Look carefully and tell me what you see, Tibalt. What do I see? I see you. And myself. Tibalt, I'm a puppet! The wooden log! I'm a freak! What do you expect me to say? Well, you've always seemed quite normal to me, Pinocchio. Yes, you're made of wood, but that's what makes you unique. Don't you see? There's no one else like you! I don't want to be one of a kind! I want to be like everyone else. But I guess I'm just doomed to be a wooden puppet... for the rest of my dumb life. Excuse me, but that's not necessarily true. I know who might be able to help you, Pinocchio. One of the clowns I know was told by another clown that there is a fairy who lives by a mountain over the faraway woods. Her name is Lyusilda, and she's been living a secluded life as she grew tired of people who only seek love and wealth. It's been said that she has very powerful magic. I'm sure she could turn you into a real boy. But be warned, Pinocchio... They say the mountain pass that leads to her house is believed to be by evil spirits. What? Evil spirits? No way! I can't stand spirits, ghosts, and other, you know, dead things. You realize I have to find that fairy! Whatever it takes! Wait! We can't leave. Everyone here is counting on us. We'll be back in time for the show. But-but-but, what if we need money on our way there? We have five gold coins, remember? So, one clown said something, and then another one said something, but the real clown here is you, Pinocchio, because you believed them! Whatever! I'll just go by myself! Pinocchio, where are you going?! Pinocchio! Wait for me, you stubborn boy. Hey! What?! Shh! Five gold coins. He has five gold coins, old furball. But shouldn't we stop them? No, buddy boy, we really shouldn't. All right, we can catch up with them later. - And then I will... - No. He is set on finding Lyusilda, right? Why don't we help him? Pinocchio? I don't like it here one bit. Are you sure we didn't get lost? Not really. The clown said Lyusilda lived by a mountain. But that's the only mountain around here. Oh, Madonna! What did I get myself into? Why couldn't I have just stayed home, safe and sound? Over there. What do you think is in there? I don't know, and I'm not so sure I want to find out. Stop being such a coward! I am not a coward! I'm just cautious. Whoa! Ahem. Excuse me. We need a little help here. We're looking for a fairy. Her name is Lyusilda. Well, you've found her, young man. I am right here! Don't you think it's too odd of a coincidence? Are you signora Lyusilda? But I thought you lived by a mountain! I did, I did, but recently moved here, my young wooden friend! Wait, how does she know that? I cannot see anything behind this curtain. Be quiet! Signora, I came here to ask for your help. I know, I know. You want to become a human. I can easily arrange that, Pinocchio. But I require a certain payment. Say... Five gold coins. Oh! That's exactly how much I have! See? Hold on just a second there. First, I'd like to ask you how do you know his name? If you don't like the offer, you're free to go! Please excuse my friend! Here! Here's your money! I beg your pardon! How exactly will you perform this transformation or whatever else you call this mumbo jumbo? A good fairy like me never reveals her secrets. Just give me the money, and tomorrow Pinocchio will be a real boy! My apologies, but just one more thing. What if we give you one coin, and tomorrow, after we make sure that Pinocchio will actually... You loudmouth! - Just give us the money! - Aha! I knew it! I knew there was something fishy going on! Hyah! Ho! Ho! He almost caught us. So long, butterface! Whoa! Santa Maria Madonna on a bicycle! Why did you have to jump out like that? You ruined everything! Meow! That stupid horse was starting to get on my nerves with his annoying questions! Well, great job! We didn't get the money, the puppet is gone, and what are we gonna tell Mangiafuoco? Meow! Am I dying? I think I'm hit! Tibalt, stop! I am wounded! And I'm sure it's fatal! Could you just stop? I'm in so much pain! I'm bleeding! - Oh, no, I'm too young to die! - Tibalt, I said, stop! Pinocchio, I can't look. Please, tell me, is the bullet still there? The bullet didn't even graze you. - I mean... - What? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Well, can you look, just in case? I still think I was hit... Maybe? No, Tibalt, trust me, you're fine. - Why don't you just check yourself? - Oh, yeah? This is just great. Look where your dream got us, Pinocchio. Tibalt, quit it. You're the one who's invincible to bullets, Pinocchio. But I would really like to keep my behind from getting shot. Who were they and how did they know your name? Another question is, how did they know about the five gold coins? I don't know. But for a little second there, it seemed to me as though they sounded like the Cat and the Fox. Hmm... The Cat and the Fox! Well, that explains everything! I always knew those circus freaks were up to no good! Enough already, Tibalt! We still need to find Lyusilda. Right! Well, I say one Lyusilda is more than enough for today. Oh... Oh! This is the mountain. It's right in front of us. Let's go! Pinocchio... Pinocchio! Wait, Pinocchio! Just wait a minute! What now? This is a bad idea. Or did you forget about the evil spirits? If you're that scared, I'll go by myself! Huh? Uh? Who? Me? Scared? I am never scared! Brave Tibalt is not afraid of anything! Let's go! Halt! Who are you? Why are you here? I knew it! That's them! That's the spirits! We're doomed! Dear evil spirits, please, we mean you no harm. We're just looking for a fairy named Lyusilda. We want to ask her for a teeny, teeny favor. There is no one here by that name! Did you hear that, Pinocchio? We got the wrong place. Sorry! We apologize. We were just leaving. And we promise never to come back. Pinocchio! We're leaving! I'm not going anywhere! Aren't you supposed to be filling in as my father? Well... I guess... I am. Then act like a father! You're supposed to teach me courage! That may be so, but what if I don't feel like it? Ay... All right, fine. I can try. Hey, you! Come out and fight like a man! As you wish, horse! You asked for it. - Huh?! - Huh? I changed my mind. You don't have to come out, you're perfectly fine where you are. That's it. Pinocchio, we're going back. No! As my father, you should say, "Don't give up, son! Never turn back!" Uh... Uh... Yeah! We're not afraid of you! Hop on. Let's go, Tibalt! Go! Oh! So, as your father, what am I supposed to say now?! You're supposed to say, "There's no obstacle you cannot overcome!" You think? Okay, I'd rather not say anything. I'll just... That was awesome, Tibalt! When we have our own circus, you and I will jump through fire. Hmm? I'm losing my touch. Hmm. Must be getting old. Oh! Wow! It is so beautiful out here! I agree. It's truly magnificent. If you ask me, it certainly looks like a suitable place for a fairy. And how may I help you, my most welcome, unexpected visitors? Um... Hello, signora. We're looking for a fairy named Lyusilda. Is that you? Yes, I sure am. So nice to meet you, signora Lyusilda! My name is Pinocchio. And this is my friend, Tibalt. And I'm guessing you've noticed... I'm a wooden puppet. Pinocchio, of course I've noticed that you are a puppet. I may even know who created you. Wonderful! In that case, let's get straight to the point. We're not here for money, wealth, and all that other nonsense. Moreover, we'll be happy to pay for your services. Mm... a reasonable amount, of course. I'm sorry, you can't buy my magic with money. Miracles... are priceless. I have to admit, I agree with the pricing policy. Now, if you really are a fairy, as you claim to be, it shouldn't be too hard for you to perform a small miracle and turn our Pinocchio here into a real boy. I'm sorry, my sweet boy. I'm afraid there is nothing I can do to help. Let me ask you, how sure are you that you want to become human? Sometimes, being human is the hardest thing. Don't get discouraged just yet. If that is your dream and something you truly want, remember this: The best miracles in this life always happen without any help from us fairies. Oh, ho, ho! I see now. If you're not up to the task, you could just say so. Time to head back, Pinocchio. On our way home, we still have, uh, evil spirits to deal with. Well, it was nice meeting you. Good luck on your journey, Pinocchio. Why didn't you turn him into a boy? For you, that's easy-peasy. It's just not the right time yet, Caro. Besides, there is a secret. If someone wants to be human, all they have to do is be human. Hmm? Mm, that's deep. Mm... Sometimes I think you forget I'm still a parrot. That went straight over my tuft. What do you mean, he left looking for Lyusilda? I will whip you to death! No! I'll kill you two with my bare hands! Boss, it's not our fault. It is not our fault, boss. It was Bella. You said it yourself, that he is crazy about her. That's why he wants to become a human. Do you even understand what's happening? I might as well toss my whole plan out the window! The whole show is already sold out! I don't see any reason to panic, boss. It's not as bad as you think it is. Not as bad, huh?! What if Lyusilda does make him human? What then? I don't need another human performer. I need a talking puppet! That's who people want to see when they come here! Hmm, do you really believe in magic, boss? He's a puppet and he'll always be a puppet. That's right. Besides, we heard him say that he'll be back in time for the performance. All we have to do now is wait. Pinocchio! Come on, buddy, don't get so upset. We'll find you another fairy, Pinocchio. This is the good thing about the time we live in. You can't spit without hitting a fairy! Listen to me. As your father, I know what's best for you! One, two. One, two. One, two. - One, two. One, two. - Looks like they're coming here. - One, two. One, two. - Quick! Hide, Pinocchio. One, two. One, two. Hurry up! We, detectives, lead the way! One, two. One, two. One, two. What's wrong with you? Why are you dragging your feet? We're exhausted, Detective. Yeah, because we don't even know where we're going. We're following the trail. Don't you two get it? No, sir! Mamma mia! I've exposed a criminal gang operating under the guise of a circus! They sell out their shows, and while the whole town watches their performance, they rob people's homes! And do you know who's behind it all? Who, detective Brioni? Who's the main star of the show? Pinocchio! He is the shrewd, hardened criminal we're after. He might not get his own hands dirty in the robberies, but it's his wooden hands that pull all the strings. He's a brilliant criminal mastermind! And right now, we are following his trail. He was seen here last night with his equine accomplice, Tibalt. So no time to be standing around! One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two... - Did you hear that? - I did. I get it now! We have to go back to the circus! No, Pinocchio! I don't think you get it at all! We are wanted by the police. They think you are a criminal mastermind, and I am your evil accomplice! We have to get out of here as soon as we possibly can! Yes, but first I have to talk to Bella! Talk to her? She's just as guilty as her father is! Tibalt, don't you get it? I have to tell her that she's in danger! Pinocchio! Why don't you understand? This is life. Sometimes, your friends are not your friends at all! Yes, Tibalt, you're a fine example of that! - What?! - You heard me! Well, in that case, if you want to spend your life in prison, go ahead. I'm out. That's fine with me! Leave, if you want! I don't need you anyway! - I will leave! - Good riddance and good luck! Keep your luck to yourself! We both know you'll need it more than I will! Hmm? Bella, Bella! My most beautiful, most loving child. You're not my real father! So that's how you talk to me? You're breaking my poor fragile heart. Let me ask you a question, tell me the truth. You let that puppet go just for one reason... To get back at me! That puppet has a name! Well, of course it has a name, Bella. But it's still a puppet. A wooden toy. At least he's not a thief or a fraud! Unlike you! Unlike us. Isn't that what you meant? Unlike us, my dear child. Don't forget that you are an indispensable part of our little operation here. I knew nothing of your shady plans with the Cat and the Fox! I believe you, child. But I doubt anyone else will be as trusting as I am. So don't do anything stupid, girl. And when that talking puppet decides to come back, do me a favor and be nice to it. That stubborn piece of wood! What was he going on about, calling me his father? I have no business being your father! You know who your parents are? - Here they are, in these woods... - an oak and a maple. No wonder you like hanging out in the woods so much. You're as smart as a log, Pinocchio. You never listen! And the best thing I could do for you was leaving you alone! Did I really leave him alone? How could I? He's my only friend in the world. What if something happens to him? He's so fragile, after all. One could easily break him in half. Or use him as firewood. Or maybe even... Turn him into a wooden mallet or a door knocker! Oh... Pinocchio... I shouldn't have spoken to Tibalt like that. He's my friend, but I love Bella. Why do I have to choose? How do humans do it? It seems so hard. Lyusilda was right. I'm not up for something like that. Uh? Let me go! Let me go immediately! Well, well, well... Gotcha! So here you are, Pinocchio, the leader of the circus gang! What circus gang? What are you even talking about? I don't understand! I did nothing wrong! That's what you all say, but if everyone's innocent, who committed the robberies? Me?! I don't know! Maybe it was you! That's it! You talk way too much. You leave me no choice, but to shut you up! Oh, no! He stuffed his dirty handkerchief in your mouth! That's just nasty! I sure hope he didn't use it to blow his nose. Look who's here! The leader's right-hand horse! A certain someone named Tibalt. If I'm not mistaken. I'm not just "someone." I am signore Tibalt, a talent agent, and I also happen to be the boy's father. And I demand that you unhand him! I'm sorry, what did you say? Did you hear that? This horse is ordering us to let the boy go. Get him! Ha! Look at you! You think I'm scared of your guns? I am Tibalt the Brave, and I know no fear! Tibalt wasn't scared of the evil spirits! Tibalt jumped over the fence with very sharp pointy things! So now Tibalt is about to show you something... And what would that be? Tibalt, run! Up to this moment, gentlemen, you've only seen my good side. But now... you'll see my bad side! Let's go! Why are you just hanging there? Get me down! Now! But we're stuck up here as well, Detective. How do we get you down? Oh, mamma mia! Why do you have to be such knuckleheads?! Thank you for saving me, Tibalt. To tell you the truth, I thought I'd never see you again. Well, I couldn't just leave you, could I? What are friends for? So, we're good? We're good. That's the detective's handkerchief! Pinocchio, I just got an idea about what I think we should go do next. But first, I have to go check something out. And I have to go do it myself. What about me? If we go together, I'm afraid you might get in my way, so wait here! Hold on, Tibalt! - But I have to... - Stay there! I'll be back soon! But I can't stay here. What about Bella? There's no time. I have to go warn her! Bella. Bella. Fantozzi! Have you seen Bella? - Pinocchio, I... - I have. And I find it insulting that you're asking this clown without coming to speak to me first. Where is she?! Don't you worry. She's perfectly safe and sound. Let her go this instant, you hear me?! Or I promise you, I'll tell the whole truth about what you're really doing! And then... Every one of you will go to jail! What? Is that a threat? Senti, Mangiafuoco, let me make a couple holes in this puppet! No! No need for violence. But Cat is right. You shouldn't threaten us. Besides, I don't think you really want every one of us to go to jail. Oh, yes, everyone! Me, Cat, Fox, Bella... Bella? You're lying! Am I now? Ha. Pinocchio! What are you doing here? Bella, do you know what your father and his friends really do?! Yes! I mean, no. I mean... I only recently found out, and I... So... you did know the truth. Tibalt was right. Wait, Pinocchio! Please, at least let me explain! No, I don't want to hear it! You heard it right. She knew the truth all along. Let's go, my boy. I have a big... No! No! A huge surprise for you! Mm? Let me go! Why are you doing this? Pinocchio? Hmm? Father? My son, I decided to come visit you, and look where we are... Isn't this touching? How's that for a nice family reunion? Let my son go this very second! Let him go, you say? Oh, I don't think so! As a matter of fact, I have a counter business proposal for you as a woodcarver. Signore Geppetto, why don't you make more puppets like Pinocchio? A whole troupe of talking puppets! A dream come true! Pinocchio is not just a puppet! He's a miracle! Then why don't you carve me an army of these wooden miracles? You, sir, are a monster! No. I just didn't get enough sleep. For now, I'll leave you two to catch up. I need to lie down. Well?! You know what to do! You will perform at my circus tonight, Pinocchio! And if you don't, your dear old daddy will pay for it. Tibalt, it's just me. Y-yes, I see that now. Uh... Have you seen Pinocchio anywhere? You know, Mangiafuoco has him locked up in a cage with Geppetto. What? Because of you, they're both locked up?! I swear, I've never wanted any of this to happen. Sure you haven't! You know, you were the reason Pinocchio decided to come back! Are you aware that we're wanted by the police? He wanted to rescue you, and now he's behind bars! Tibalt, you have to believe me. I didn't know what my father was doing behind my back. Your father? Yes! He, the Cat and the Fox rob people's houses during our show times. I knew it all along. You were involved in this shady business! I didn't mean to! You have to believe me. I want to help Pinocchio, but I don't know how! Oh... I'm sorry, but where did you get that handkerchief? This one? It was with me when Mangiafuoco found me in the woods as a child. He's not my real father. Well, this changes everything. Hmm... Lyusilda was right. Sometimes miracles do happen in this world, eh? Dad, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. I should have never left my home. And now, I'm a pathetic thief to them all. I swear, I didn't know! Of course, Pinocchio. I have never doubted your honesty, son. Thank you, Dad. Listen, Pinocchio, we have to do something. We can't let them get away with it. Well, what can we possibly do? I promised that I would perform tonight. I gave them my word. And you will keep your word. I swear on my beautiful, regal name. Tibalt! You found us! Of course I did! You didn't think you could get rid of me that easily. I promised Geppetto to look after you, and horses are well-known for keeping their word. What do you think we should do, Tibalt? Well, I have a plan. I've got everything figured out. We will perform tonight. We'll put on a show that Mangiafuoco won't soon forget! And the best thing is, this time we will not have to do it alone. Ladies and gentlemen! Please allow me to present to you the discovery of the season! The world's one and only talking puppet! Pinocchio! And his horse, Tibalt! Bravo! That's amazing! - Pinocchio! - Pinocchio! My little hero! Would you look at that? Everything is going according to plan. It's time for you two to get to it. - May I have your attention, please?! - You should see this, boss. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an important announcement to make! Me and my friends have prepared a little song for you to enjoy. A song? I don't remember approving this. Oh, well.

Police! I knew it! I don't know about you, but I would like to stay out of jail! Dear ladies! Dear gentlemen! I didn't rob anyone! Well, I did. But they made me! I'm just an artist. You know me! You love me! Me too! Believe me, I never meant to rob anyone! You have to believe us, it was Mangiafuoco! He is the one behind it all. You're gonna get arrested! Scoundrels! Please! Please! What kind of ridiculous accusations are those? It's obviously a lie. Besides, you have absolutely no proof. You have no witnesses! We are the witnesses! Attention, everyone! My noble friend Tibalt told me what's going on in your circus. And now, I have testimony from several witnesses, as well as confessions from the culprits... The Cat and the Fox. Signore Mangiafuoco, you are under arrest! What? My ingenious plan is ruined?! Oh, it's all your fault! You stupid puppet! Fire! Get out of the way! Quickly! Arrest the Cat, the Fox, and Mangiafuoco! Ha! Good luck with that! Oh? Oh! Don't worry, I'm here. Get over here! You will be my ticket out of here. Out of my way! Pinocchio! Get your paws off her! Stay back, or I will hurt your little girlfriend! Mamma mia! I have to get out! And you stay here! - Pinocchio! - Bella, I'm coming! Hold on, I got you! Grab the ring, and I'll let you go! Pinocchio! Hold on! Bella! Pinocchio! I'm coming to help! What are you doing, Bella? Go on! Get out of here! But Pinocchio is still out there! I said, now! I've always known that I'd die young! I'm coming, my friend! Is he alive? Pinocchio! My poor boy! Pinocchio! Pinocchio, do you hear me?! Wake up, I'm begging you. Wake up, Pinocchio! Oh, no! Pinocchio...? Buddy! You are alive! Uh, yeah, I guess so... And you are human now! What? What am I? I'm really human? Of course you are. Don't you remember what I said? Everything comes in due time, Pinocchio. Signora Lyusilda! Did you do this? No, my sweet boy. You did it yourself. You sacrificed yourself for another. Only someone with a real heart and soul could do this. I am so sorry I wrongly accused you, my dear Pinocchio. Signore Tibalt told me the whole story, and we came up with a perfect plan for catching the real criminals. And look at that! They're all arrested! And the case is closed! And now, it's time for me to go back and start the paperwork on the case. Just one minute there. The case is not closed just yet. Detective Brioni, would you be so kind as to show me your handkerchief? My handkerchief? Um... I don't think I have it. Of course not. You left it in my mouth, remember? Great. Now, Bella, would you show us your handkerchief? Signorina, where did you get this? It has my family's monogram on it. I had it with me when Mangiafuoco found me in the woods. Hey! Bring Mangiafuoco over here! Tell me the truth, and it will be used in your favor during the trial! Will it, now? Ha! Very well then. I'll tell you the truth. I never found you. I just bought you, little girl, from someone who kidnapped you from you parents! Oh, my God. It was 11 years ago. My darling little daughter went missing, and that's when... That's when I decided to become a detective and find the kidnappers! So, all this time I thought I was looking for criminals. But it turns out, I've found my own daughter! You are my father? Yes. Your mother will be so happy to see you. This is so nice. Bella, congratulations! Detective Brioni, Bella, I'm so happy for you! Thank you! I can't believe it myself! It's incredible! Ladies and gentlemen! We're proud to present our show for you tonight! Welcome to the amazing new circus of "The Brioni Family and Their Friends"! Hooray! Bravo! Whoo! Ah-yup! Ah-yup! Ha ha! Brava! Bravo, Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Whoa! Are you sure? I am, Tibalt! Go! Whoa! Whoa!
