Why are you taking it off? Come sit. Bulbbul! Bulbbul? Bulbbul? Bulbbul? Where is this girl? Caught you! On the trees again. Who is this, Auntie? Bit of a scruffy urchin... but we will take of her. Hey! He's right. Now I have to get you ready all over again. Auntie, why do I have to wear toe rings? Because there's a nerve here. If it is not pressed, girls tend to fly away. Like a bird? No. It is to control you. Auntie... what's "control"? Auntie! Dad! Auntie! What are you doing, you lunatic? She must have gotten frightened. Auntie. Auntie... Do you want to listen to a story? Is it a scary story? Yes. Sure. A long, long time ago... there was a Demon-Woman. She lived on trees in the deep, dark woods. She had feet that were twisted all the way around. That blood-thirsty demon waited... and waited for the day... when the princess would come... so that she could gobble her up. Doll. Mahendra! I forbade you to come here, didn't I? Doll. Binodini. Can't you keep your husband in check? Forgive me, Milord. Mahendra... my brother. He's like a kid. Where is he? Who? My husband. That's me. No. He was small like me. He was with me in the palanquin. He told me a story. His name was... Satya. When you grow up, you'll know the difference... between a husband and a brother-in-law. Slow down! Sorry, Sir Satya. This place is not safe. There is danger here. She lives here. Who? The Demon-Woman. You woke up, Sire? Go to sleep. I will wake you up once we reach the manor. Is sister-in-law asleep? Yes, Sire. - May I serve you dinner? - No. It's fine. Please don't be upset, Milady. Too late for that. And what will your poor first wife do? They'll live together like sisters. Get out. If she suffers in any way, you'll have to answer to me. Are you playing at lord of the manor, sister-in-law? One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Seven, eight... Nine, ten... Eleven, 12... Then what happened? Then the Demon-Woman blew out all the candles in the princess's room. Fool! Then? She tiptoed to the princess's bed, and... To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit? Oh, I see. Come to check on your inheritance, have you? Sister-in-law... Haven't heard from you for five years. It can't be that you suddenly missed me. I wrote to His Lordship... and always asked after you. He didn't respond. I wanted to come three years ago... when Mahendra... was killed. They say that... the Demon-Woman killed him. And you believe this nonsense? Not at all. Binodini says so. So much has changed in these past five years. Even His Lordship left home. What went wrong? Would you like to meet Binodini? Binodini. Little brother. The goddess has not done right by me. Really? How can you say the rosary and curse god in the same breath? A litany of prayers feels like a lament. Spent my whole life praying, and see... what I got in return. I was immersed in prayers when the Demon-Woman killed Mahendra. Now, even if someone dies of a fever or falls off a tree, people blame it on the Demon-Woman. Really? Did Mahendra have a fever? He was lying there drowned in his own blood. You witnessed it. Sounds like an animal attack. Do you remember Brother Indranil used to tell us of a man-eating tiger? There were bloody twisted footprints... on the floor. It was the Demon-Woman. The same nonsense again. There's been no Demon-Woman until now. Where did she suddenly appear from? From the trees. What... Then? Go on. She tiptoed to the princess's bed, and... What are you two doing in the dark? Why do you spoil everything? I'm so sorry, Milady. I just came to tell you that your husband needs you. Why? I have no idea. He should ask for me. I'm the one who takes care of him. I don't know why he still wants his Bulbbul. How does one tell him... that his Bulbbul only wants Satya? She sleeps during the day. Hunts at night. All right. So even I will hunt at night. Binodini will only be satisfied when you've stuffed and mounted the head of the Demon-Woman on the wall. Tiger, deer... Demon-Woman! Where did the sweet little lady I knew disappear? What did you do with her? I gobbled her up. Where is Her Ladyship? She's downstairs in the veranda. You're obsessed with my feet. How observant of you. Hey, have you met Dr. Sudip? Doctor? Is everything okay? Yes. He just came to visit. I will leave now. I have got to go check on her. When will that master mend his ways? Which master? Master Dinkar. He's a fine man. His wife's broken bones tell another story. She is also of no help. She keeps saying... "I fell off the stairs." So maybe it's true. There is only one house in this place that has stairs. Milady. How many times have I told you not to call me "Milady"? Whatever you say... Milady. Do you want to go on a hunt with Sir Satya? I save lives. I don't know how to take them. Sire. Why do you look so annoyed? You're not even veiled. Go. Aren't you getting late for your hunt? - Master Dinkar. - Yes, Sir Satya. - Are these all the men you could gather? - Everyone is afraid of the Demon-Woman... Enough of this nonsense. Let's go. Sir Satya! Sire, at least now you know that it is the Demon-Woman. A murderer. It's a human being. A man. Inform the police officer that someone killed Master Dinkar. Yes, Sire. I live close by. We can keep the body there for the night. You stay so close to the forest. Did you see... or hear anything? No. Nothing. Neither an animal... nor a human. Nothing. How was the hunt? Master Dinkar was killed. And it wasn't an animal. It's the work of a man. Why? Why not a woman? What woman is capable of such a brutal murder? Milady. Feels like... nothing has changed. The two of you... chatting away. To what do we owe this pleasure? Satya did not tell you? He asked me to come. He said you are all alone here... day and night. Anyone can walk right in and take advantage of you. - That's why I... - No. I just thought it is Mahendra's death anniversary. - Right. - I thought we could all be together. And you would want to hold a prayer meet for him. Right? The police officer is here, Milady. Tell him I'm coming. Now I'm here, sister-in-law, you can relax. It behooves us to do what we are meant to. You are the lady of the house, not the lord. What I mean is... how long will you do everything? You look exhausted. Maybe because of the color, or maybe gray does not suit you. Everyone is not as fortunate as you... to look nice even in dull, plain clothes. Oh, my You shameless hussy Why do you walk down the garden path When you know It leads to that bastard? Milady. Come. Sit. Come. Let me oil your hair. Later? The jewelers have sent new things. Have a look. Aren't they exquisite? At least choose a trinket or two. As it is, you hardly got anything from home. You look like a drab little thing decked up in all your dowry. What if people say... I look more like the lady of the house than you do? I don't care. Yes. You care nothing for what people say or think. At least get new toe rings. Yours seem to have loosened a bit. I'll take it later. Oh, my You shameless hussy Throwing caution to the winds Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why do you cross the threshold? I beg of you - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! Subhashish, what is the point of being a police officer? There have been so many murders, but you don't even have any suspects. Suspicions do not count. Our British law asks for proof. Let's go, Master. A murderer. It's a human being. A man. You stay so close to the forest. Did you see anything... or hear anything? Shall I make paan? Sister-in-law, since when has the doctor been here? He was... here before your brother left home. Does he... visit here a lot? It's not like I live here. How would I know? When you were here, did he visit then? We were just talking about you. I should leave. I have some work with the police officer. I will see you at dinner. He was questioning me about Sudip. Dr. Sudip is... a fine man. Maybe it was just a casual query. And you were adding your two bits. Me? I didn't. Milady, you know me. I never mean any harm or say anything bad about anyone. Shall I make paan? Yes. Go right ahead. Bulbbul. No. - Play... - Please don't. - Play... - Please don't. Mahendra. Is he sulking? Satya. Brother. Come here! Happy? I've asked the groundsman to pluck some mangoes. Will you make some relish for me, or are you going to eat them all yourself? Paan? So... I got you some perfume. So have you thought about the proposal? Proposal? The marriage proposal for Satya. I had told you. Madam, what do you think? "Madam"? No... I think I put too much catechu in the paan. A slip of the tongue. I... I meant... "Milady." So tell us, Milady. Should we get Satya married? Why do you need to ask her? Hey. She has the first claim to Satya. Shouldn't we check with her before we get someone else for him? Shouldn't we ask Satya? What? About the proposal... that Binodini has got for him. You're not happy about it. When I write my bit as a straightforward story, you turn it into a spooky one. Now, where did this girl's ghost come from? You wrote this bit. Now explain it to me. Sister-in-law... wasn't your childhood home blue in color? Why don't we color this place blue? It's looking a little shabby, and that way, you won't miss your childhood home. Why do we need to paint it? - It's fine. - Hey. We both sit and write here. Shouldn't it look pretty? Where will you get the time to write after you are married? Married? Binodini has got a proposal for you. I'm not getting married. Everyone gets married. Priests don't, minstrels don't, neither do owls. And if you all force me to, I will become like a gypsy and roam around singing songs. Oh, my You shameless hussy Oh, my You shameless hussy It's not his fault. It's his age. He spends all his time with her. This was bound to happen. Why don't you ever wear shoes? It's exhausting how you never learn. I am making arrangements for you to go to London. Really? I have told Binodini. You can always get married later. - First, complete your education. - London? Don't you remember? I mentioned that Satya will go to London to study law. But don't just study. Travel, have fun. And then write me letters telling me everything. I'll write every single week. But now? - He has to leave now? - Not now. After the festival. We will need to get warm clothes stitched for you. I've heard it gets cold there. Snows as well. But, Milord, the festival is only three months away. How will we arrange everything? It's not like you have to do anything. Why don't you come along? Not now. Maybe later. Just three months. I have written my bit. Now you have to write the rest. How will we ever complete this story? There is still time. What about that house by the pond? You were going to have it painted. I will before I leave. Then you can sit there and write. I'm scared of being there alone. I'm scared of being here alone. Who will talk to me now? Whom will I... I will write every day. I will come back soon. What if you don't? Then? At least light the lamp. What is that? Nothing. Why do you look so guilty, Bulbbul? No. That is... It's just... something personal. The only thing personal in a wife's life is her husband. I'm headed to Calcutta... along with Satya. Why? Why are you taking Satya? We have to get... his travel documents prepared. One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Seven, eight... Nine, ten... Eleven, 12... Thirteen, 14... Ready or not, here I come! Ready or not, here I come! Oh, you're back, Milord? Satya? I've sent him to London. SATYAJEET THAKUR MRS. BULBBUL CHAUDHARY No. Is Mahendra still asleep? Yes. How is Milady doing? It's silly of me to ask. Of course she must be devastated. She must be in mourning... Satya Bulbbul Do you have to leave? There's nothing here for me. Don't worry. I'll keep sending money. She hasn't yet gained consciousness. I have done the needful, but her feet... She fell from the stairs. She fell from the stairs? Pay the doctor... and give him a little tip for his services. I'm sorry to bother you this early, but there has been another murder. There's a witness, a little girl. She seems to be in shock. Poor thing. She was saying... What? The goddess killed him. I would like to speak to her. She's sedated. The doctor gave her a pill. Which doctor? Dr. Sudip. Fortunately, he was close at hand. Thief. It's a fine. You haven't come to see me for days. I thought Sir Satya is here, so you would be busy. Oh, he's the busy one. He has a new hobby these days. What were those stories you used to read to me? - The one with the detective. - Yes. Sherlock. Yes. So Satya is playing Sherlock these days. It's not a joke. He suspects you. Actually, there is not even a speck of truth to it. So why worry? Depends on what he suspects me of. I have no expectations. You know what? You are way out of my league. Which is why I draw boundaries... to keep myself a little safe. Coward. Oh, yeah. - Are these all the crime reports? - Yes, Sir Satya. This signature? It's Dr. Sudip's. He came to examine the body. What are these papers? It's a story. A scary story. Want to hear it? A man comes to town... and suddenly, people start getting killed. But this is not the scary bit. A girl falls in his trap. She forgets herself, and she forgets right from wrong. She abandons all shame, all that was good and true about her... even her husband. And then the unthinkable happens. Her husband leaves her. A nice story indeed. Sister-in-law... enough. You made a mistake. We'll assume... you were alone, foolish, and Sudip took advantage of it. Just come right out and say it. You're jealous of Sudip. Sister-in-law, stop saying his name. Sudip. Sister-in-law... Sudip. How you have changed! I have written to your husband... to ask for his advice. I don't think he will take you back, but maybe... it would be best to send you back to your family. You are all the same. Milord... Doll. Get up. Get up! Play, play. Play! No! Play. Play! Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! You have married into a royal family. Why the tears? Keep quiet. He's a little... insane, but he'll be fine after marriage. He's a little insane, but... he's of royal blood. Keep quiet. He's a little insane, but you will be adorned in jewels. He's a little insane, but... you will be draped in silks. You will get respect. Keep quiet. He's a little insane, but... if not him, then his brother... will look after you. Large manors have large secrets. So keep quiet. - How is she? - She's regained consciousness. I have told everyone that they shouldn't touch your feet. Careful. You've lost so much blood. Who did this? I'm your doctor. You can trust me. Then do your job and leave. Milady. Everything is ready for the prayer meet. Prayer meet? Prayers for Mahendra's death anniversary. How can I forget? It's such a special day for us both. Are you going somewhere? Don't worry. I won't do anything. The first time I met you, I wanted to put a bullet through you right then. Now I know why. Your fate will be decided by the courts in Calcutta. Last night my father threw out my mother from the house last night. His new wife made him do that, and now look what my mother has done. Where is your father? He has taken Sir Satya. Where? Aren't you afraid? Of what? The consequences of your crimes. You think you will get away with it. If it depends on the law, then yes. - I suspect you... - You suspect something entirely different, but intend to punish me for another crime. Although, there is a way. I will believe you are completely innocent... if that Demon-Woman appears before us. Driver? Driver! Don't move, or I'll shoot. Driver. Have you fallen asleep? Straighten your feet. How will you heal if you don't? I have healed. Milady. - Milady? - Doctor! She was... She was here! There is a witch. We have to find her. - Let's go. - Go back home, Sire. What? Go back to your manor. Why? I'm not afraid of her. If you are, you're welcome to leave. At least we know... you're innocent. You can leave. - What are you doing? - I'm going to hunt her. Sire, stop! Why are you trying to stop me? Why are you trying to save her? Who is she to you? She is just my friend, but isn't she everything to you, your... Why such fondness for a demon? She's not a demon. She's a goddess. There's a witness, a little girl. She was saying... the goddess killed him. - Master Dinkar. - A fine man. His wife's broken bones tell another story. The goddess has not done right by me. I was immersed in prayers when the Demon-Woman killed Mahendra. Milady! Milady! Milady! What have you done? Why are you trying to save her? What is she to you? She is just my friend, but isn't she everything to you, your sister-in-law? And it wasn't an animal. - It's the work of a man. - Why? Why not a woman? One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Seven, eight... Nine, ten... Eleven, 12... Thirteen, 14... Dear brother... I always thought that when I grew up, I would like to be like you. But I'm leaving this house forever... because I'm afraid... I might become like you. Because I'm afraid... I might already be like you. Now we are literally related by blood: the blood that has stained all our hands. Now we are all the same. Milord. Milord. Bulbbul? Subtitle translation by Anju Choudhary
