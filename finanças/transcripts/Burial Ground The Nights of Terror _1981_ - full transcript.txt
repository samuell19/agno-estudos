I am the only one who knows the secret. Incredible. Of course. It's so... It's so... No, no... Stop, stop! Leave me alone! No! But George... It looks like the staff are asleep. Didn't you tell them we were coming? As you know, sweetheart, I've never had a telephone. At least that way nobody can bother me here. Excuse me, I forgot! Voila. - Did you have a pleasant trip, Sir? - Thank you. Welcome back, Doctor. Please. - What a pity, the weather has changed. - Don't worry, it'll be fine tomorrow. - Didn't you hear us? - We were upstairs, in the lounge, Mr Conte. - Nicholas, where is the Professor? - He must have left early this morning. He may well be down at the excavation site. You needn't worry. Sometimes he sleeps there. Nicholas, please. Get dinner ready at once. We're tired. By the way. Take the cars to the other yard. - Alright, Mr Conte. - After you. What are you doing? Eh? - You don't like it? - Oh yes! A lot. Where did you find this stuff? I found it in the bathroom. Inside an old trunk. Funny, isn't it? - Sure. - Maybe a mistress of George's grandfather left it here. Or maybe he wore it himself. Why? Didn't you like my show? You really look like a slut. But, this is how you excite me. Yes... yes, James. Yes. Mother! Michael! What are you doing here? Get back to your room - What are you doing? - Mark, something terrible is going to happen. - We must warn the others. - But, Janet. - We have to get away from here, now. - Calm clown, Janet. - No, it's important. Don't you understand? - Enough now. You'll make yourself look foolish in front of the others. Sweetheart. What would you say to them? That you've dreamt of The Big Bad Wolf? Besides, what are you afraid of? You're with me. We've been waiting a week to be alone together. Right? Come on. We've wasted the whole morning in here. Why did we come to the country anyway? To be locked up inside a mausoleum? Be patient, sweetheart. We'll go out shortly - Hey everyone! - Hey! Hi! - It's almost night-time. You've both slept well? - Yes, we were dozing. Where is the Professor? Has anyone seen him yet? He's a bit odd. All scientists are the same. - Do you have any idea of what he wants to tell us? - Only vaguely. He's studying magic, that was practiced by the ancient Etruscans. Something connected to the survival of the dead...something like that. I've always been afraid of the dead, surely it's better we leave them in peace. The other night I had a terrible dream that really shocked me. - It was as if we all... - Oh Janet, my dear! Don't worry about your dreams. Come on, the light is amazing in the park. Let's go. I want to take some great photos. Come on, let's go. - See you! - Oh yes. In the afternoon, the light is fabulous here. Okay folks. I'm going to go write outside, see you later. - Can I come too? - Yes,you can come for sure. Come Evelyn, I want to show you the Professor's findings. The pavilion is quite far away. But it will be a lovely stroll, you'll see. Michael, why don't you come with us? It's so beautiful here! James... Look at me ! Yes. One more like that. Good... Well done. Now come forward to me...stop! Like that...good. That's it. Good. Stay there, don't move! That's it. Wait. I hope you didn't break anything? That's odd, suddenly, I felt the earth move under my feet, but there are no holes here. Come, we'll continue. Stand in the middle. Turn to your left. That's it. That's good, wait... Turn to me. You're becoming very good indeed. - Then I deserve a raise then? - I'd rather pay you another way. What's going on? Oh, my god! That's enough, James! Can't you spend some time with me instead? Of course, come. It's so good like this. There... That's it... - Darling, you shouldn't close your eyes when you shoot. - I can't help it. - You'll see, little by little... I'm pretty sure I'll never learn. I love you just the way you are. Mother! What is it, Michael? What's wrong, darling? Cheer up darling. Come here. - Mark, what is that? - I don't know. - It's monstrous! - Yes, it can't be human. It's not human anymore. It's like he's been eroded away by time. - Mark! - Janet! - I'm scared, Mark! - Let's get away, Janet! Hurry, Keep UP- - It's a miracle of preservation. - It also belongs to the professor. Well, he's my guest. Anyway, a scientist should never... - Mother. - What is it? Mother, this thing... it smells of death. It's just an old rag. What strange ideas you have. Where do you get them from? - George! - Mother! Who are you? Who are you? What do you want? Don't come any closer! Don't move or I'll shoot! Stay here. No, don't move! Don't move! Stay back, or I'll shoot! Stop! Careful, George! One more step, and I'll shoot! Stay where you are! Stay where you are! Stop! Go away! Go away! Stay where you are! Mother! Damn you! Damn you! - Evelyn, run away! - Go Michael! Run! Go away! Leave! But you're insatiable. Yes! You like me that way, don't you? Sure. Yes. Like that. James! Look! - It's nothing, it must be a joke. - It's no joke, James! It's not a joke! More... there's more of them! They're coming towards us! I'm scared, James! What are they? I don't know, I don't know... Incredible! They're living corpses! James, they're coming from everywhere! Quick! Let's get back. - Help me. - Get up, Leslie! Get up! Damn it, who closed it! Come on, push! Come on! Close it. Quick, Mark! Quickly! Come on! Janet! - My foot is caught in a trap! - Oh, Janet! Hang on! Damn it! - It hurts so much, Mark! - I can't open it! - Pull it Mark! - Damn! Wait. I'll try another way. It's unbearable, Mark! - It's unbearable! - I can't do it! I can't do it! - I can't stand it, Mark! - Hang on! Hang on! Look out! Mark, look out! Bloody Hell! Bastards! - Mark, watch out! - Damn you! Mark! Mark! Help! Help!!! Come on. There's Janet! She's in the garden! Help! No! James! Leslie! Hurry! Janet! Help me! Are you okay? Quick! Get me out of this! - Come on, give me a hand. - I can't bear it! - Nice and easy. - Careful! Careful! - That's it good. - It hurts! Come on, Janet. It's over. Come on now - Let me take her. - What is happening here? This must be what the professor was trying to tell us. I dreamed all about this. I knew something terrible was going to happen. - It's over Janet. - Please Mark, let's get out of here and quickly! It's here! - They're coming! - Let's get to the cars, quick! - Open up! Let us in! - Open up! Help! Nicholas! Kathleen! - Open up! Open up! - Open up! Help! They can't hear us. Come, we'll try from the courtyard. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother, we can set it on fire. Mother! Set it on fire. Mother! Janet, Mark, wait! They caught George! Damn! They're also here! To the villa! Open up! Hurry! For Goodness sake, open up! - Open up! Let us in! - Open up! Open the door! - Open up! - Open up, hurry! Inside! Come in, quickly! - How come there's no power? - Strange things are happening. The lights came on all of a sudden. Then, there was some kind of power surge. The bulbs on the chandeliers exploded. Then the whole electrical system went crazy! - Come on! Hurry! - Let's close all the doors and windows! Here you go. Two hours and we've heard nothing. - Kathryn please. Check the corridor and the kitchen. - Right away, sir. - This one is fixed now. - We'll nail up the others too. We'll catch-up later. Here. Hold it steady. Help! Help! Kathryn? Kathryn? Kathryn! Those dirty bastards...dirty bastards... You need to shoot them in the head to kill them. I'll get rid of as many as I can! - Give me more cartridges. - Here you are. You too, worm ridden filth! They're going away, at last. Give me more cartridges. - All gone! - Bloody Hell! They're clearing out. Maybe tonight they'll leave us in peace, and tomorrow someone will come get us! Come on! Ok, let's take a look. Of course it hurts, it's all swollen. A tight wrapping is needed. We need some bandages. I'll go. Help! James! Wait here. They're here! They're trying to get in. I don't know how long it will hold. Call the others right away. Mark! Mark! Janet! Help! Help! Help! Mark! Janet! Help! Help! Damn you! Mark! Damn you! Janet! Give me the sword! Bastards! Mother! I'm scared! Mark, help me! Mark! Help me! Die you bastards! Bastards! Mother! Mother! Michael! How disgusting! Well done, Evelyn. Now let's get out of here. Disgusting! Let's go, Janet. Help me, Nicholas. Come on. We'll board up these doors, and the windows. Mother, I can't take it anymore. Don't leave me Mother. Poor baby! Can you ever forgive me for bringing you to this cursed place? Of course, Mother. Oh Mother, I love you so much. I need to feel you near me. To touch you... When I was little, remember? You always held me to your breasts. I like your breasts so much. Michael! You are... What am I? What am I? Your son! Leslie? Leslie? Leslie. You're injured. Do you...do you want me to call the others? Oh no! Mark! James! They're coming back. There's at least 30 of them. - They'll get into the house, sooner or later. - What can we do then? Let them come in! Maybe it's the house that interests them. - I've got an idea! - What is it? We let them come in. We'll hide in the passageway. They move so slowly after all. I'll get Michael. Michael? Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! My boy! On, my boy! Say something to me... No! Murderer! You bloody murderer! Damn you! You killed him! Damn you to hell! Damn you to hell! Damn you! Michael! Baby. Say something to me. This can't be! No! No! Listen. Let's go! Quickly! Let's stop for a moment. Hang on. It's them! Let's go! Quickly! Quick. Evelyn? Evelyn. Leslie and Michael, where are they? Wait here. Damn! Leslie! Why? - What happened? - Dead. They're both dead. We need to get out of here soon and quickly! - Nicholas, get us some weapons, anything! - Right away. Meet us downstairs at the entrance. Be quick Be careful. Oh, Professor! We were getting worried about you. We need to move quickly. No Professor, they're waiting for us. Professor! - Wait here. - Stay together. Nicholas. Nicholas! - Disgusting! - I can't look! It's horrible! - It's the Professor... - He's a zombie too! Let's - Come on Evelyn. - Quickly! We have to get as far away as possible. James, what a way to wake me up! We've got to move, Mark. I've looked around, there's no one about. Janet. Wake up! We have to get out of here. - No, I can't do it! It's too sore. - Come on, Janet! - Come on, Janet! - We have to get to the gate. - I'll help you darling. Come on! - I can't! We can't stay here, Janet! - Just leave and go! I want to daft! - Don't be silly! Get up! I'm going crazy! I'd rather die! Evelyn, we have to go. Get up. Come on. That's it, good. - Look there! - A monk. It must be a convent. - Somebody, at last. - Let's go! It's open. Come on, let's go in. Come on Evelyn, we're safe. Can I come in? There's no one. Well, let's go in, come on. Slowly...Slowly! Sit down here. That's it. I'll take a look around. The monks will surely have something for your foot. - Should I take off your shoe? - Not now. Anybody here? Father! Father! Sorry, brothers, if I'm disturbing your meditation. The main door was open and we took the liberty of coming in. Brothers, very strange things are happening. So we need your help. ls there a telephone here at the convent? No, it can't be! Get off! Let go of me! Help! Quick! Let's go. Come on. We can do it! James! No, James! Hurry!
