WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO START TROUBLE. THIS IS ONLY A STORE. JEEZ, YOU TWO ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. JUST KEEP IT BALANCED, RICHARD. NOW, YOU LOOK-- DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO DEL. HE'S A TOTAL PLERB. WHICH IS SLANG FOR "WUSS" IN ABOUT 20 YEARS. JUST GET IN THERE AND DIG OUT A STORY. TAKE NO PRISONERS. [♪♪] WALTER'S KID! LOOK HOW THEY GROW UP. I GAVE HIM HIS FIRST HAIRCUT. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE MISSING PIECE OF YOUR EAR, THERE'S A LOST AND FOUND BOX IN THE BACK. [CHUCKLING] REMEMBER THE STORY HE DID FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE CLARION? YOU WERE A PIT BULL! I'M NOT DOING THOSE KIND OF STORIES ANYMORE. YOUR DAD WOULD'VE BEEN PROUD. MAY HE REST IN PEACE. AMEN. ACTUALLY, I'M DOING A STORY FOR THE EAGLE. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT SIR SAVE-A-LOT?

STAY IN SCHOOL, GRADUATE, GO TO COLLEGE, YOU KNOW, GET MARRIED, HAVE TWO AND A HALF KIDS, LIVE A QUIET AND UNCOMPLICATED LIFE, PREFERABLY AS AN ACCOUNTANT.

I AM SETTLED, AND I AM HAPPY, AND I HAVE FINALLY FOUND SOMEBODY GOOD IN MY LIFE, SO, PLEASE, JUST STAY OUT OF IT. JACKIE... JACKIE! [BICYCLE BELL JINGLES] HELLO, RICHARD. HI, ANNA. COMING OR GOING? I JUST PICKED UP A COPY OF "DR. ZHIVAGO" AT THE BOOK NOOK. TWO PEOPLE MADLY IN LOVE BEING PULLED APART BY FATE. IT'S TRAGIC. FOR SOME REASON, I LIKE IT. I'M GOING HOME WITH BORIS PASTERNAK HERE AND LIGHTING THE FIREPLACE TO GET ME THROUGH THE COLD RUSSIAN WINTER. CARE TO JOIN ME? UM, NO, I GOT TO, UH-- YOU STOOD UP MY CLASS TO TALK TO THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER. YOU OWE ME, RICHARD KERM. [♪♪] [LAUGHING] RICHARD, I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO ADMIT SOMETHING TO YOU, BUT I'M VERY SHY. WELL, ALCOHOL MAKES ME VERY NON-JUDGMENTAL, SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. I HAD AN ENORMOUSLY FRUSTRATING CRUSH ON YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU LOOKING FOR ME, HANDSOME? ALWAYS. CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY. THANKS. IT'S A BIG DEAL. I MEAN, FINDING THAT ONE PERSON. YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW. HAS RICHARD BEEN HERE? [CLEARS THROAT AWKWARDLY] WERE YOU EVER MARRIED? NO. NO. YOU? ONLY TO THE CAREER. WELL, I, UH, I'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE, FROM MY CAREER. WHY? IT HASN'T BEEN A VERY FULFILLING MARRIAGE. DO YOU GET LONELY? YEAH, SOMETIMES, WHEN I THINK ABOUT BEING LONELY, WHICH IS WHY I TRY NOT TO. YOU? UH, I'VE HAD MY... SHALL WE SAY, DALLIANCES... WHICH HAVE SATISFIED ME ONLY MOMENTARILY, BUT, UH, IN GENERAL, SURE. I GUESS AS LONG AS I'M THE MAYOR, THEY'LL COMPARE ME TO MY FATHER. IT'S A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW. DADS USUALLY ARE. WHAT DID YOURS DO? ELECTRICIAN. HE DIED WHEN I WAS 11. I'M SORRY. WELL, HE USED TO SAY, "SOMETIMES LIFE IS LIKE THE BLINDSPOT IN YOUR REARVIEW MIRROR." RICHARD WAS ALSO 11 WHEN HIS DAD DIED. IT WAS A SAD DAY. THE TWO OF YOU ARE CLOSE, HUH? USED TO BE. WHY AM I EVEN TALKING ABOUT HIM? IT'S STRANGE. RICHARD'S DAD WAS ALSO AN ELECTRICIAN, AND YOU BOTH HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY, AND THE SAME NAME. IT'S WEIRD. YEAH, STRANGE. BUT YOU I LIKE. TOO BAD YOU WEREN'T 25 YEARS YOUNGER. YEAH, TOO BAD. BUT, YOU KNOW, RICHARD'S A GOOD GUY. HE'S JUST CONFUSED. AREN'T WE ALL? WELL, I'D BETTER FIND HIM. THANKS FOR THE COFFEE. LISTEN, I SAW HIM OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT EARLIER. HE WAS TALKING TO ANNA. SHE GOT INTO HIS CAR. [LAUGHING] WELL... I SHOULD GO. RICHARD, I CAN'T LET YOU DRIVE IN THIS CONDITION. I PROMISE YOU, I'LL BE OKAY. I'VE GOT A GUEST ROOM. YOU CAN STAY HERE. NO, I'M... NO, I'M FINE. RICHARD, GIVE ME YOUR KEYS. NO, I JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M JUST GONNA WALK IT. IT'S A COUPLE OF MILES-- THE, UM... YOU KNOW, THE FRESH AIR WILL DO ME GOOD. UM, THANK YOU FOR TONIGHT. AW, GEEZ. YOU'RE DRUNK. YEAH. SO, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND ANNA. OH, WHAT, YOU DON'T KNOW? I DON'T REMEMBER. HMM. REMEMBER THIS? UH, YEAH. SURE, I REMEMBER THAT. YOU DON'T, DO YOU? [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY] OH, THE 55-YEAR-OLD ME... LISTEN, WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE, YOU WON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING EITHER, NO MATTER HOW MUCH ZAMOONIUM YOU TAKE. ZA-WHAT? ZAMOONIUM, IT'S A MEMORY DRUG. IT HITS THE MARKET IN ABOUT 2016. [SIGHS] WELL, MAYBE I NEED SOME ZAMOONIUM, BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER GIVING DEL MY SIR SAVE-A-LOT STORY. I THOUGHT I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. YOU DID. THAT'S WHERE I FOUND IT. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT DOING JACKIE ANY FAVORS TRYING TO PROTECT HER FROM THE INEVITABLE. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? WELL, IT MEANS-- NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. [SIGHS HEAVILY] [♪♪] [SIREN WAILING] ARE YOU KIDDING ME? [OVER LOUDSPEAKER] STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE! ASSUME THE POSITION. RITA, WHAT'S GOING ON? WHOA! ARE YOU TRANSPORTING NARCOTICS? NO, OF COURSE NOT! AH, RELAX. I'M JUST STAYING IN SHAPE. I GOT THE FINGERPRINT RESULTS. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS, AND, UH... I'M SORRY I WASTED YOUR TIME. IT WAS EXCITING FOR A WHILE. I THOUGHT I HAD MYSELF A PERP. IT TURNS OUT, YOUR PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THAT CUP. WHAT, JUST MINE? YEAH, A PERFECT MATCH. HMM. HOW ABOUT A ZESTY MEXICAN OMELET, CHUCK? IT COMES WITH CEVICHE, HAND-ROLLED CORN TORTILLAS. IT'S A REAL MORNING PICK-ME-UPPER. OKAY, MOOSE, BUT HOLD THE JALAPENOS. REFLUX. CAN DO. HEY, CHUCK. MOOSE, HAVE YOU SEEN DICK? UH, NO, NOT SINCE LAST NIGHT. PANCHO SPECIAL, 86 THE SINUS-CLEANERS! 10-4! OH, JACKIE'S WORKING THE KITCHEN TODAY. SHE'S FEELING PRETTY LOUSY. SHE GAVE THE RING BACK TO JEFF LAST NIGHT. WHY? RICHARD, YOU DON'T KNOW SHE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU? MOOSE, I WANT TO CHANGE MY ORDER. WHAT ABOUT THE QUESADILLAS? WITH SAUSAGE, AND GUACAMOLE? WHY ARE YOU HERE, RICHARD? JACKIE, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOU GUYS BREAKING UP-- WHY ARE YOU HERE? ARE YOU HUNGRY, IS THAT IT? JACKIE, COME ON, PLEASE? LOOK-- WHAT, THE SCHOOL MARM, SHE DIDN'T MAKE YOU BREAKFAST THIS MORNING? JACKIE-- OR THE TWO OF YOU COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED? HEY-- DID SHE MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS? JACKIE, LISTEN TO ME-- [GROANING IN PAIN] NOTHING HAPPENED, JACKIE! SO, THEY SAID THE ON-CALL DOCTOR WILL BE IN TO REVIEW YOUR X-RAYS. RICHARD, I AM SO, SO SORRY. MY TEMPER'S BEEN HORRIBLE LATELY-- OH, JUST LATELY? YEAH, IT'S JUST... I REMEMBER THIS FIFTH GRADER, SHE SLUGGED THE SCHOOL NURSE WHEN SHE WAS GETTING A FLU SHOT. IT WAS CRAZY. JACKIE. I, UM... I'M GOING TO WAIT OUTSIDE. NO, NO, PLEASE STAY. SO, RICHARD, HOW'D IT HAPPEN THIS TIME? BRUSHING YOUR TEETH? IT WAS MY FAULT. I BET. [WINCES SHARPLY] YEAH, JUST AS THE X-RAYS CONFIRMED. A MILD FRACTURE. I ASSUMED YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP, JACKIE. IF I KNEW YOU WANTED A PINATA, I WOULD'VE BOUGHT YOU ONE. JEFF, THAT'S NOT FAIR. FAIR? HEY! OW! IT'S THE LATERAL ULNA, ALL RIGHT. JEFF! I'M-I'M SORRY, RICHARD. CAN I COME OVER TONIGHT? I JUST WANT TO TALK. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YOU OWE ME AT LEAST THAT. [WINCES] PLEASE EXCUSE US, RICHARD. UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, BETTER YET, UM, JACKIE, CAN YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE? PLEASE? I SEE YOU GOT A NEW STETHOSCOPE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? TO, UH, REPLACE THE ONE YOU LOST? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL, DOC. NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR JACKIE'S HOUSE TONIGHT, OR ANY OTHER NIGHT. NUMBER TWO, IF YOU EVER, EVER HURT HER BY TELLING HER ABOUT YOUR LITTLE INDISCRETION, I WILL DO A CHARACTER ASSASSINATION PIECE ABOUT YOU IN THE EAGLE, THAT WILL LEAVE YOU WITH ONE OPTION FOR PRACTICING MEDICINE-- PROCTOLOGY, AT THE SUFFOLK COUNTY PETTING ZOO. YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU PLERB. [CLEARS THROAT AWKWARDLY] [♪♪] WHAT'S WITH THE GOOFY GRIN? I DON'T KNOW. I'M A HAPPY FOOL. [CHUCKLES] SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID TO JEFF? I TOLD YOU, WE, UH, JUST WENT OVER MY X-RAYS. I FEEL SO BADLY FOR HIM. [SIGHS CONTENTEDLY] I FORGOT HOW MUCH I MISSED THIS PLACE. IT'S HARD TO APPRECIATE WHEN YOU'RE A KID. IT'S HARD TO APPRECIATE A LOT OF THINGS. YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF RINGS, UM... WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT PIMPLE OF A DIAMOND I GAVE YOU? NO, LET ME GUESS, YOU TRADED IT FOR A BAG OF PEANUTS? NO, NO ONE WOULD GIVE ME A BAG OF PEANUTS, SO I BURIED IT IN THE ATTIC SOMEWHERE. BUT I DO HAVE THIS. JACKIE, THAT'S MY DAD'S OLD WATCH. MM-HMM. HOW DID YOU GET... WHEN YOU LEFT FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CLARION, I FOUND OUT IT WAS AT HICKEY'S PAWN SHOP, SO I BOUGHT IT. IT WAS GOING TO BE YOUR WEDDING GIFT. THANK YOU. JACKIE, I... I PAWNED THE WATCH SO I COULD BUY YOU THE RING. WELL, THEN I GUESS THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE. RICHARD, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME BACK? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, GOD KNOWS I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A TON OF TIMES, I WOULD JUST KIND OF... KEEP COMING BACK TO, "I WAS 19. THAT'S WHAT 19-YEAR-OLDS DO." NOW I'M 30 AND I'M ALL OUT OF EXCUSES. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HIT ME, ARE YOU? [CHUCKLING] NO. YOU ARE ME. I'M YOU-- WE ARE US! SO YOU FINALLY BELIEVE ME? I... I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND IT, BUT WHY NOT? OUR FINGERPRINTS MATCH. I KNOW! IT'S GREAT, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU. WHEN YOU WERE 30, DID YOU ALSO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU, AND DOES THIS HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY? WHY ME? SHH! [QUIETLY]: I CAN'T! SHE KEPT THE RING. BUT OF COURSE YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, TOO. I-I'M GETTING USED TO THIS. LOOK AT THIS. DAD'S WATCH. YEAH. WAIT, SHOULDN'T YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS? IT'S A LONG STORY. WELL, TELL ME EVERYTHING. WHAT HAPPENS TO ME? I CAN'T DO THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR. YOU HAVE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. OH, COME ON. TELL ME SOMETHING YOU CAN. UH, WELL, OKAY. TELEVISIONS AND COMPUTER SCREENS ARE HOLOGRAMS NOW. WHAT ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING? STILL NO ANSWER. WELL, UH, WHAT ELSE DO YOU GOT? UM, HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND JACKIE BEEN MARRIED? WHAT'S SHE DOING NOW? LET'S TALK IN YOUR OFFICE. OKAY. DONALD BRICKHOUSE, VICE PRESIDENT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SIR SAVE-A-LOT, IS GOING TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE OF BUSINESS EXPERTS TO TRY TO REVERSE WHAT HE CALLS "A DISASTROUS PROBLEM". WHAT'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH JACKIE? WHAT PROBLEM? THE BANKRUPTING OF SMALL TOWNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AGAIN WITH THIS? SIR SAVE-A-LOT OPENS A HUGE STORE, WHICH SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF THE LOCAL MERCHANTS, WHO GO OUT OF BUSINESS, CAUSING AN EXODUS FROM THE TOWN, CAUSING SIR SAVE-A-LOT TO GO BELLY-UP. [SNAPS FINGERS] INSTANT GHOST TOWN. GLENVILLE? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE? BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME UNTIL YOU BELIEVED THAT I WAS YOU. OKAY, LET'S GIVE THIS BRICKHOUSE A CALL. WE CAN'T. WHY NOT? BECAUSE HE WON'T BE V.P. OF ACQUISITIONS FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS. EXCUSE ME? RIGHT NOW, DONALD BRICKHOUSE WORKS IN THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT. THEY PROMOTE VERY FAST AT SIR SAVE-A-LOT. WELL THEN, HOW DOES HE KNOW ABOUT STORES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND TAKING SMALL TOWNS WITH THEM? HE DOESN'T. IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET, BUT IT WILL, IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS. [SIGHS] THAT'S MY SOURCE? A GUY WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A SOURCE YET? YOU KNOW, AS A JOURNALIST, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM. SOMETIMES, YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT. [SIGHS HEAVILY] I NEED SOME TIME TO DIGEST THIS. THERE IS NO TIME. THE TOWN VOTES TONIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL JACKIE. WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL HER? THAT GLENVILLE'S NOT GOING TO BE AROUND IN FIVE YEARS? BASED ON WHAT FACTS? [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, THINGS WERE JUST STARTING TO GO REALLY WELL FOR JACKIE AND ME. I LIKED YOU MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU WERE JUST A NUT. THIS IS TOO HARD. I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT HEAD OF OURS. [SIGHS HEAVILY] I THINK THERE'S SOMEPLACE WE HAVE TO GO. I WAS ANGRY AT HIM, TOO. I'M NOT ANGRY AT HIM. HE DIDN'T LEAVE, RICHARD. HE DIED. YEAH, WHAT AM I, AN IDIOT? IT'S NOT ABOUT INTELLIGENCE. WHAT YOU THINK UP HERE, AND WHAT YOU FEEL DOWN HERE-- TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. DOWN HERE IS ALWAYS MORE POWERFUL. YOU KNOW, IF HE WAS STILL ALIVE, THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, HE'D KICK ME IN THE BUTT AND SAY, "DUMMY, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING." MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. [SCOFFS] AND THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WHAT, YOUR OWN FATHER FIGURE? IT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT THE DAY YOU STOP RUNNING IS THE DAY YOU'LL START MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY DIED BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I WROTE, SOMETHING THAT... MIGHT NOT BE ENTIRELY TRUE. HEY, I KNOW. RECALLING THAT DAY MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH. AND YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO IT AGAIN. IF YOU DON'T, A TOWN WILL DIE. AND IF I DO, I ALIENATE JACKIE FOR GOOD. [CLOCK CHIMES] I'VE GOTTA TALK TO YOU. CAN'T NOW, RICHARD. AFTER THE VOTE. NO, BEFORE THE VOTE, JACKIE. IT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO WAIT. SORRY, IT'LL HAVE TO. [BUZZING WITH CONVERSATION] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE'RE BOTHERING TO VOTE. NO ONE IN TOWN'S EVEN AGAINST IT. THEN LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF. YOU DON'T COUNT, CHUCK. YOU'RE AGAINST EVERYTHING. NOT TRUE. DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT BOO SANTA CLAUS AT LAST YEAR'S CHRISTMAS PARADE? HEY, SANTA CLAUS IS NOT A WOMAN! [MOOSE BELLOWS] [MAN]: TAKE YOUR SEATS, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR COMING, EVERYBODY. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR GLENVILLE. NOT ONLY ARE WE VOTING ON OUR PRESENT, BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR FUTURE-- AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF MY OWN VOICE ON THE SUBJECT, SO LET'S GET THIS DONE. AS HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM HERE FOR OVER A CENTURY, WE WILL VOTE BY A SHOW OF HANDS, AND I DO NOT WANT TO CATCH ANYONE RAISING BOTH HANDS. UH, WHAT IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSONALITY? [LAUGHTER] IN YOUR CASE, TUG, DON'T BOTHER RAISING ANY HANDS. [LAUGHTER] OKAY. THOSE IN FAVOR OF SIR SAVE-A-LOT-- UH, CAN I SAY SOMETHING? UM... BEFORE YOU ALL VOTE, CONSIDER THIS, SIR SAVE-A-LOT IS A RELATIVELY NEW CHAIN, WITH ALMOST NO TRACK RECORD. RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [DICK, MUFFLED]: LET HIM SPEAK! I MEAN, DO WE WANT TO BE GUINEA PIGS? NO ONE KNOWS WHAT KIND OF EFFECT A STORE THAT BIG WILL HAVE ON OUR SMALL TOWN. OUR TOWN? YOU DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE. BUT I WAS BORN HERE. I GREW UP HERE. YOU ALL KNEW MY FATHER. HE HAD A SAYING, "IT DOES NO GOOD TO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND BECAUSE YOUR BUTT IS STILL STICKING UP IN THE AIR." I MEAN, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT ALL BIG BOX CHAIN STORES ARE A PROBLEM, BUT SO FAR, SIR SAVE-A-LOT IS SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF BEING ONE. [DICK, MUFFLED]: MAYBE HE'S RIGHT! YEAH, MAYBE HE'S RIGHT. I SELL FISHING WORMS, WILL. IS SIR SAVE-A-LOT GOING TO SELL WORMS? PROBABLY NOT. YOU CAN CORNER THE MARKET ON WORMS. [QUIETLY]: CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC? [ROOM BUZZING WITH CONVERSATION] JACKIE... GLENVILLE IS GONNA GO UNDER. PROOF. GIVE ME PROOF. WHERE ARE YOUR FIGURES? WHO ARE YOUR SOURCES? I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING CONCRETE YET. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, RICHARD? LOOK, THIS IS GONNA SOUND BIZARRE, OKAY, SO, PLEASE, JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND? OKAY, LOOK, SUPPOSE YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN YEARS BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND BY HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE, YOU COULD CHANGE THINGS, I MEAN, THINGS THAT WOULD BE DISASTROUS. ARE YOU WITH ME SO FAR? YOU JERK. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. YES, LISTEN TO THE MAN. 11 YEARS, AND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED ONE BIT. ANYTHING FOR A STORY. ANYTHING FOR THAT CAREER OF YOURS, NO MATTER WHO IT HURTS. NO, I HAVE CHANGED, JACKIE. TELL HER. HE'S RIGHT. HEY! THE NATIVES ARE GETTING RESTLESS. ARE WE VOTING? NO. I HAVE TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL. DEL, CAN YOU REPRINT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY IN TOMORROW'S PAPER? SURE. FRONT PAGE. OKAY, THAT SHOULD SETTLE THINGS, AND WE'LL VOTE MONDAY NIGHT. ALL RIGHT. AND NOTHING, OR NO ONE, IS GOING TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. DON'T LET HIM DRAG YOU INTO THIS. "HE'S RIGHT"? THAT'S THE BEST YOU HAD? [♪♪] HOW YOU DOING? AS LONG AS YOU KEEP BRINGING ME THESE, I'M A HAPPY FOOL. WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHEN? DICKIE'S HAD A BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK. WHICH IS WHY I HOPE I CAN GET AWAY WITH SAYING THIS WITHOUT YOU TAKING A SWING AT ME. MAYBE RICHARD HAS A POINT. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO DELAY SIR SAVE-A-LOT UNTIL ALL THE FACTS ARE IN. DICK, I LIKE YOU. LEAVE IT ALONE. I LIKE YOU, TOO. YOU'RE TERRIFIC. THANKS. BUT THEN, YOU ALWAYS WERE. [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] I ONCE HAD A GIRL JUST LIKE YOU. WHAT HAPPENED? I RAN AWAY LIKE A COWARD. SO YOU WERE NEVER MARRIED? NO. I NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE HER AGAIN. BIGGEST REGRET OF MY LIFE. WHERE IS SHE NOW? THAT'S A LITTLE HARD TO EXPLAIN. YOU SHOULD GO SEE HER. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST FOR SOME PEOPLE. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [SIRENS WAILING] [MONITOR BEEPING] JACKIE, WAIT. THEY'RE RUNNING SOME TESTS. LISTEN, I'M SORRY. YEAH, I'M HERE FOR DICK. HE WAS AT THE RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT... AND HE HAD A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK. I DROVE HIM HOME. SUCH A SAD, LONELY MAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS GIRL, THE ONLY GIRL HE EVER LOVED. HE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT? MM-HMM, AND WHAT'S SAD IS, HE NEVER MARRIED HER, AND HE'S REGRETTED IT EVER SINCE. HE NEVER MARRIED HER? NO. HE'S BEEN ALONE HIS ENTIRE LIFE. SO HE'S NEVER BEEN MARRIED? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. [SIGHS] I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU A FRIEND OF DICK WOODSTEIN'S? YEAH, WE'RE, UH, WE'RE JOINED AT THE HIP. WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEDICAL RECORDS ON HIM. DO YOU KNOW IF HE'S TAKING ANY HEART MEDICATION? I DON'T THINK HE HAS A HEART. DO YOU MIND LOOKING IN HIS ROOM AT THE GLENVILLE LODGE? NO, NOT AT ALL. [♪♪] [MONITORS BEEP STEADILY] [MUMBLES SOFTLY] [GROANS] HOW YOU FEELIN'? FINE, UNTIL I SAW THE MONITOR. WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? THEY DON'T KNOW YET. WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW THIS TO ME? 'CAUSE YOU WOULD'VE TOLD HER. YOU NEVER MARRIED JACKIE. WHY DID YOU TELL ME I WOULD MARRY HER? TO KEEP YOU HERE SO YOU WOULD. WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, AND I CAME BACK TO GLENVILLE, I DIDN'T STAY. I LEFT THE DAY JACKIE GOT ENGAGED TO JEFF. I COULDN'T HANDLE IT... AND I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN, UNTIL NOW. I'VE LED A PRETTY UNHAPPY AND... UNDISTINGUISHED LIFE SINCE I WAS YOUR AGE, AND THE WORST PART OF IT IS, I'VE GONE THROUGH IT ALONE. SO WHEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I FOUND MYSELF BACK HERE, I KNEW I HAD A CHANCE TO CHANGE THINGS FOR JACKIE... AND YOU. SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS? ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE IT? I DON'T KNOW. I LEFT, YOU STAYED, EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW. I'M IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY AND SO ARE YOU. HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE WHETHER I MAKE IT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO! YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO CHECK OUT WHEN I'M 55 YEARS OLD, OKAY? YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHEN I CHECK OUT. THAT'S TOO CREEPY. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HI. GOOD NEWS. THE TESTS SHOW NO HEART ATTACK. WE THINK YOU HAD A VASO-VAGAL RESPONSE, PROBABLY CAUSED BY STRESS, SO JUST GET SOME REST, AND WE'LL HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE BY TONIGHT. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU. [SIGHS WITH RELIEF] CHEER UP, MAN, WE'RE GONNA LIVE. BIG DEAL. JACKIE WON'T. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO SHOW HER THIS OBITUARY. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. WHY NOT? LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S CREEPY TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GONNA DIE. LEAVE IT ALONE-- NO, I'M NOT JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT ALONE. OKAY? EVEN IF WE CAN'T HAVE HER, I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT SHE AND GLENVILLE HAVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, SAY, "HI, JACKIE, I'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE FUTURE"? SHE THINKS YOU'RE CRAZY AS IT IS. WELL THEN, I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. RIGHT? HEY, COME ON! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU ARE SO FULL OF CRAP! YOU CAME HERE TO CHANGE ME? YEAH, THAT'S A JOKE. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED, LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE 55 YEARS OLD AND YOU'RE STILL A QUITTER. [SIGHS WEARILY] THESE ARE FOR DICK WOODSTEIN. THESE ARE FROM DEL AND THE GUYS AT THE EAGLE. [CHUCKLES] THIS IS FROM RICKY. THE GUYS FROM THE BARBER SHOP. YOU KNOW... AND THESE ARE THE FOLKS YOU WANT TO QUIT ON? [SIGHS] OKAY. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? WE DO WHAT WE DO BEST. [♪♪] [DEL]: WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? THIS IS GOOD. IT'LL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. OH, BOO-HOO. YOU KNOW, YOU WHINERS DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE WHAT YOU WANT, ON ANY ISSUE, GET IT PUBLISHED BY A REAL NEWSPAPER AND READ BY A BIG, INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE, WHO CAN ACTUALLY APPRECIATE IT, NOT SOME HIGH SCHOOL CRO-MAGNONS WHOSE MAIN INTEREST IN LIFE IS WHAT LADY GAGA'S GONNA WEAR IN HER NEXT VIDEO. IT'S SUNDAY, ISN'T IT? ALL DAY. [BEEPING DOOR CODE] YOU KNOW THE CODE? IT'S SO PREDICTABLE. IT'S THE PRINCIPAL'S DATE OF BIRTH. WOW, THIS PLACE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME! WAIT, Y-YOU WENT TO SCHOOL HERE, TOO? YEAH, RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, I CARVED MY INITIALS-- GUYS! WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. [QUIETLY]: ARE YOU CRAZY? OKAY. LET'S GO SELL SOME PAPERS. UH, THE OAK IS FREE, ACTUALLY. I-I KNOW. IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. RIGHT. [DICK READS]: "ONCE UPON A TIME, "THERE WAS A SMALL TOWN, "A TOWN SO BEAUTIFUL, "IT WAS AS IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A PICTURE POSTCARD. "IN THIS TOWN LIVED A SMALL BOY. "GROWING UP, "EVERYTHING THE LITTLE BOY DID WAS CONNECTED TO THE TOWN "AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE. "HE FELT WARM AND SAFE. "HE EXPECTED IT WOULD BE THAT WAY "FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, "BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING. "FOR THE FIRST TIME, "THE BOY FELT LOST, ABANDONED, "OUT OF PLACE, "SO WHEN HE CAME OF AGE, "HE PACKED UP, "MADE PROMISES TO THE GIRL HE LOVED "THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP, "AND LEFT THE TOWN "AND THE PEOPLE "THAT WERE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF HIS LIFE, "MAYBE TO FILL THE VOID, "MAYBE TO CREATE HIS OWN DESTINY, "MAYBE TO TRY AND FORGET. "HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHY. "WHAT HE FOUND "WERE OTHER TOWNS, MAIN STREETS, "OTHER CITIES, "THE NEXT ONE LOOKING LIKE THE LAST ONE, "AND THE PEOPLE WERE NOT LIKE THEY WERE "IN HIS HOMETOWN. "ALWAYS IN A HURRY, BUT SEEMINGLY GOING NOWHERE. "CROWDED TOGETHER, BUT LOOKING LONELY. "SOON, HE DISCOVERED "THAT HE HAD BECOME ONE OF THEM, "AND WHATEVER HE WAS LOOKING FOR, "HE WOULD NOT FIND "UNTIL HE CAME BACK TO THE VERY PLACE "HE RAN AWAY FROM, "AND THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED FORM HIM "AS A HUMAN BEING. "HE WAS SURPRISED AND COMFORTED "TO FIND THAT HIS TOWN WAS EXACTLY AS IT WAS WHEN HE LEFT." [RICHARD CONTINUES READING]: "WHEN YOU LEAVE "FOR A LONG TIME, "YOU FORGET WHAT HOME MEANS TO YOU, "WHAT YOU'VE BEEN MISSING, "UNTIL YOU COME BACK, "AND WHAT I SEE IS A TOWN "THAT, FOR OVER 100 YEARS, "CREATED ITS OWN DESTINY "WITHOUT COMPROMISING ITS PERSONALITY OR CHARACTER. "SO MY QUESTION "TO THE PEOPLE OF GLENVILLE IS, 'WHY MUST SIR SAVE-A-LOT BECOME A PART OF THAT DESTINY?'" "YES, CHANGE CAN BE POSITIVE, "BUT IT CAN ALSO UPSET THE DELICATE BALANCE "OF AN ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE. "AND TURN SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE LOVED "INTO SOMETHING INDISTINGUISHABLE, "OR WORSE. "SHOULDN'T WE PRESERVE OUR HISTORY "INSTEAD OF RISKING ITS EXTINCTION? "I LOVE THIS TOWN, "ALMOST IN THE SAME WAY "I LOVE THE WOMAN I LEFT 11 YEARS AGO. "SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU'RE SCARED, YOU RUN, "BUT I'M NOT SCARED ANYMORE, "AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME "TO START PRESERVING SOME OF MY HISTORY, "WITH THE ONLY TOWN "AND THE ONLY GIRL I'VE EVER LOVED, "IF THEY'LL STILL HAVE ME. "I URGE YOU NOT TO CHANGE THE FACE OF OUR TOWN. LET'S BE THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE." [KNOCKS HESITANTLY] HEY, DICK? [EXHALES NERVOUSLY] WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, HONEY? JACKIE? IS THAT YOU? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. I JUST... I WENT FOR A WALK. RICHARD, EVERYBODY'S WAITING FOR US AT THE RESTAURANT. YOU CALLED ME RICHARD. OF COURSE. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? [CHUCKLES] MY FAVORITE SCAR. I PUT MY LOVE BRAND ON YOU FOR LIFE WITH A FROZEN CHICKEN. YOU REMEMBER? WOW. YOU SHOULD GO FOR WALKS MORE OFTEN. WE'LL FINISH THIS LATER, BIG BOY. WE'VE GOTTA GO, WE'RE LATE. WHERE ARE WE GOING? YOU'RE FUNNY. UH, GIVE ME A MINUTE, OKAY? [♪♪] [HUMMING WITH CONVERSATION] HEY, MOM, DAD. PAULIE! PAULIE... HEY, PAULIE, SAY HEY TO GRANDPA. HE'S GOT MICHAEL'S EYES AND YOUR HAIRLINE. [CHUCKLES] RICKY, I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. RICKY. ARE YOU KIDDING, MAYOR? I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD. SHE'S STILL THE MAYOR? MISS WHAT? [LAUGHS] AND YOU'RE STILL A WISE GUY, HUH, RICHARD? JUST DON'T ASK ME TO PULL DOWN MY PANTS AGAIN. HEY, RICKY, I READ YOUR STORY IN TODAY'S TIMES. BRILLIANT AS USUAL. BLAME IT ON MY MENTOR OVER HERE. DRINKS. MISS WHAT? MOOSE. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. MEATLOAF? OF COURSE. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? YEAH. I'M JUST... A HAPPY FOOL. [CHUCKLES] JACKIE... DO YOU REMEMBER A GUY ABOUT, UH, 25 YEARS AGO NAMED DICK? YEAH, VAGUELY. I DON'T REMEMBER HIS FACE, BUT HE... HE WAS A SWEET OLD GUY AND HE LIKED MEATLOAF. AND THEN ONE DAY HE JUST DISAPPEARED. WHY? IT DOESN'T MATTER. 25 YEARS. WHAT'S THE SECRET? EVERY DAY IS LIKE DAY ONE. [GLASSES CLINK] [♪♪]
