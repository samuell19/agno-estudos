Alderman Gilliam's office. What are you upset about? It's not a black-owned business? That's right! Yeah, but it's a Chinese food restaurant. So what?!Yeah! I know it's fried rice, but it's not "fried" rice. Alderman Gilliam's office. Hi, honey! Hey, hey, Kim, Kim, Kim. Hey, how is it going, honey? Got tickets to the symphony.Really? Well, hold on a second, Listen, on your way home... 'cause I got call. Mays, you better... I got another call! Mays? Mays?! Vote for Gaines and James. The Million Babies' Mamas' March? It's a very good cause. No, you're going to have to call Reverend Barton for that one. I got these food stamps... No, you can't use food stamps to buy tires. Alderman Gilliam?I'm sorry, Mr. Hawkins. What can I do for you? Your girlfriend's on hold. Honey, wait, hold on a second.... put me on hold every time! Now, now, what was it, Mr. Hawkins? The bus, Mays. I read where they're gonna shut down our bus line. Mays, are you listening to me? If they do that, I can't get to work. Unless they give me a job in that new mall.Don't worry, Mr. Hawkins. I've been talking to the people downtown, and I promise you this: If they shut down this bus line, I will drive you to work myself. You got my word. Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back! Okay, I gotta go. Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, alderman of the Ninth Ward of Washington, D.C. Not the part of D.C. that you're familiar with. I work in a neighborhood so bad, you can get shot while you're getting shot. Around here, when people have a problem, they don't call the mayor, they call me. Come on, come on, come on. All right, okay. Miss Pearl! Miss Pearl! What's going on? Mays, Dionne is in the house! I know she is! Look, I don't know what she's talking about. We checked the house; there's nobody in there. Hey, man, Dionne is her cat. Well, whatever. Cat's got nine lives. He'll be fine. Frank, can't we let one guy go in there and help this lady get her cat? Can't do it, Mays. Once they laid the explosives, there's nothing I can do. She just showed up. Come on, man, you already took the lady's house. Can you at least let her get her cat? Hey, we didn't take her house. We gave her 40 grand. 40 grand? What kind of house is she supposed to get with 40 grand? What, a crack house? I think she'd be happy to get out of this rattrap. Who the hell are you to call this place a rattrap? This is my neighborhood. This is where I'm from. I got my first bike stolen right there. My daddy got his bike stolen right there. When I have a son, I hope he's fortunate enough to get stuck up right there. Now, can't you let somebody go in there and check? We already looked. There's nothing in here. Now, look, we got work to do here. Leave the people alone! Let's go. Let's get this thing going. Come on, now. Come on, Mays! Come on, stop being in such a hurry. We been here all morning. Dionne?! Come on, baby! Oh, sugar baby. Come on! Could you at least turn it off? Let the lady get her cat. Dionne, baby?! I got something for you! Dionne! Miss Pearl, no! Dionne! Dionne! All right, turn it off. Turn it off. Wait'll this woman gets her cat. Shit! It's not working. Cut it off! Turn it off! She better get out of there. It's gonna blow! Miss Pearl! Miss Pearl! Miss Pearl! Miss Pearl, come on! Oh, no, Mays! Come on! Mays, you've only got a minute! Miss Pearl... Miss Pearl! Fix it! Get to work! I'm trying! Get a union man on this-- Mays! Get out! Mays! Miss Pearl, we got to get out of here. They're gonna blow this place up. Oh, they wouldn't do that, baby. They know we're in here. Miss Pearl, I love you. I've known you a long time. Now, you've seen a lot of things in your life. You've seen churches burnt to the ground. You've seen dogs sicced on children. You've seen Malcolm X killed. You've seen JFK killed.

Damn it! Those guys should have known better than to talk on a cell phone in a plane. What about Sanderson? That's a joke. Lewis has been Vice President for eight years. He's a war hero, and he's Sharon Stone's cousin. He can't lose. What about Mosley? Boys.McMasters? We just concede the election to Lewis? Don't worry, nobody said anything about conceding, Debra, but let's get real here. You know, we're gonna lose this one. So the thing to do is to set the party up for the next election. We need a candidate that's going to put on a good show. This isn't a circus. It's a presidential election. You can't just pick some... some guy to run for President. This is unprecedented, but if I put in a call to the party chairman, we find a candidate, he'll back him. Who's going to run a race that they know they can't win?

I think we found our man. Oh, look at this! This is, this is great! This is America, see? Little guy against the big guy. Corporations against the people. Young versus old. What's better than this? Come on, give me a break! I'm going to run an alderman for President? No. He's not an alderman. He's a hero. Who doesn't like a hero? Big business loves a hero! See? Bill, you said that we needed somebody who can help the party. Now, how in the hell does this guy help the party? I'm glad you asked. See, the United States is changing. Well, America is changing. Inside of 20 years-- well, you know the numbers: 20 % black, 21 % Asian... 39 % Hispanic. The minorities will be the majority. Now, the smartest thing we can do is be the first party to nominate a minority for President. How about a cripple? I don'’t think so, Charlie. Now, uh, we'll lose, of course... but the minorities will be happy. The minorities will be happy, and they will vote for us in 2008 because we've shown we support them. And the white people will vote for us because, uh... well, our guy isn't black. You got my vote! Geller, why don't you, uh, see if you can track down this, uh, Mays Gilliam? Uh, Charlie... go check our accounts. Give me one good reason why I should go along with this. Don't you get it, Debra? I intend to run for President in 2008. Now, you give me one reason why you shouldn't. Well... I mean, he-he would take a lot of work. And we can run a background check, but it's obvious he's not a party line candidate. I mean, he's just some kid who thinks he can make a difference. Don't worry about all that. You just go out there, you put the machine behind him. You get 25 points in the poll, consider it a win. Make sure he doesn't embarrass us. After this is over, we get to work. When I'm President... I'll take care of you. Coop, you got to help me. They locked me out of my office. I know. The mayor is fed up with you. How many times have I told you? You got to quit trying to fix stuff. I could have got you into the council next term. Now you're red-lined. Shannon's taking over your district. They need to smooth over this mall situation, and that bus thing's about to heat up. They don't trust you.They don't trust me? I'm not the one stealing people's houses. You see, that's what your problem is right there. You got to work with us, Mays! That stuff you pulled over there cost the city money. Makes the mayor look bad. Now, contrary to popular belief, politics is no place to express yourself. You want to get in, you got to fit in. And look at you. Grow up. You got to dress better.

We know everything. Mays, we'd like you to do something for us. Yeah, sure, I-I-I'd love to work on a presidential campaign. You know, I'll make phone calls... send out flyers. Now, who have you guys chosen to run against Lewis? Well, that's exactly what we wanted to talk to you about. We'd like you to run for President. Of what? The United States. Of what? Of America. Which America?: North...! America, Mays. Get outta here! We're not joking, Mays. We want you to be the nominee for the office of President of the United States of America. Okay, let me get this straight. You guys couldn't find anybody else to run? You couldn't find nobody? Mm, something's wrong here. You couldn't find a-a congressman, a senator? I mean, I'm just an alderman. Congressmen, senators, they work with other politicians. You're an alderman, Mays. You work with the people, and that's what we want-- a man of the people. This is a big joke, right? They've got a hidden camera somewhere around here. Y'all are gonna get a big laugh outta this. Well, you know what? I don't even care, 'cause one of y'all is gonna drive me home 'cause my bike is messed up. You an American, Mays? Wow. Bill Arnot. Are you an American? Yes. Mays, this isn't just an election. It's a moment. This is the moment when you have the opportunity to show little boys and girls, men and women, what America's all about. Look at that. When I see that, I think of our forefathers fighting to make this country what it is. And when I see that, I think about the guy who's got to scrub it for minimum wage. That's why we want you, Mays. You care about the little people. So what's it going to be? It gives me great honor to accept the party's nomination for President of the United States of America. No! Welcome to your campaign headquarters. These folks are going to do everything they can to help you get elected. These are your people. Oh, here, let's take a look at this. Hey, Mark, is that cued up? Yep. Roll it, please. Yeah, yeah. Yeah... Oh, this is a great spot. If you love America, vote Mays Gilliam for President. Huh? But I'm-I'm not in it. You don't even see my face. Well, it's a template. We'll get you in there eventually. Mays, there's a couple of people I want you to meet. This is your security director, Mr. Earl. You're going to be in good hands. Pleased to meet you, sir. If you ever find yourself in trouble, just yell "security," and my people will handle the situation. This is your decoy, Mays Junior. He enters all of your events before you. If anything's going to happen to you, it'll happen to him first. You know, Tupac could've used a guy like you. This is Nicollette White. She's your Executive Director of Internal Liaisons. You can call me Nikki. It will be a pleasure to serve you. I am available to you around the clock. Just let me know. Now, what does she do? Oh, she sleeps with you. Oh, we get tired of getting caught up in sex scandals, so we commissioned our own team of super whores. You call yourself whores?! Move that fat ass! One! Two! Three! These girls are good. Good morning, Mays. I took the liberty of choosing some options for this evening's fundraiser. You don't mind, do you? No, no, I-I'll wear whatever you need me to wear. Now, what fundraiser is this? It's your coming-out party. Campaigns cost money. The people you meet tonight have plenty of it. Now, Geller and I are going to advance the party, and Mr. Earl will bring you 8:00 sharp. Here are your off-the-cuff remarks. Learn them. See you later. Okay. Sir! Remember, sir, just nod and move. Nod and move. Mr. Gilliam! So, what do you plan to do about taxes? Do you plan to support paternal leave incentives? Hey, could you get my demo to somebody? Anybody, please! Please! Don't accept any unscreened packages, sir. It's a security measure. Mays, Mays... You have some people to talk to. Tomorrow, work. Tonight, smile, shake hands, and be nice to the wives. I'll double-check the P.A. system. You'll make a brief statement at 11:00. Okay, let's go.Let's go. Hi. How you doing? All right. You all right. I wish you luck, sir. Arrigato. It's a little bit like Timberland, you know, and I got a little bit of Missy moving up through there, but what I'm really trying to go through is that Neptune kinda feel, you know, so I... Excuse me, Mays, the Teamsters are here. What are you doing talking to the help? Gentlemen, Mr. Mays Gilliam. Guys, I just want to say, hey, I'm all for labor, I'm all for unions, but you know and I know that you guys are gonna endorse Lewis. It's a business decision. We're going to do what's best for the union. By the way, have you decided on a running mate? We're thinking about it. Well, we think maybe you should consider Sanders. Well, we're considering several options. Yeah, well, maybe you should also consider giving us support on that new referendum.Excuse me. Well, that depends. Can we depend on your support...? What's up with this guy? Track four. Check out track four. So, what do you have there? Well, we got some shrimp puffs and some cheese snacks-- you know, just some... finger foods. Thought that was you. So, what's up with the two jobs? Bad credit? Why do I have to have bad credit? Why can't I be saving up for a car or for school? Maybe I like to work. Excuse me. Hey, I'm sorry. You know what? I never got your name. Lisa. Lisa Clark.Hey, Lisa Clark. Mays. So why you being so rude, Lisa Clark? I'm not trying to be rude. I'm working. We're not supposed to mingle with the guests. Plus, I don't know you. You know me.Uh, no, I don't know you. But you know me.

It just seems like maybe I should be talking about something a little more relevant. Relevant? Yeah. I mean, people are cheering, but they would cheer if I read the recipe for cornbread. I mean, it's not like it's working. I'm only one point up in the polls. Oh, don't worry about the polls, Mays. They're just a sampling. Polls change. Don't get ahead of yourself, Mays. We're here to help you. Besides, the people really like you. Cheer up. We're going to be in Chicago in a few days. You got a brother in Chicago, don't you?

I mean, make it look like you believe in what you're saying. Okay. I know we haven't exactly always seen eye to eye, but this, Mays, is very important. I can't stress that enough. Alderman Gilliam? There's a Mitch Gilliam outside. He says he's your brother. Mitch? Send him in. Tonight, America is going to get its first impressions of Mays Gilliam. You know what they say about first impressions.

When they gonna let you speak? I've been talking all day, man. I was talking to the press this morning. You been talking, but I'm saying when they gonna let you speak your mind? This ain't you. You going to say this shit? This shit is booty. You go out there and say this if you want to, watch sandman come sweep your butt offstage. Look at this. You got a poster: "Mays"-- who they talking about? Willie? Let me tell you something, Mays. These are everyday common folk, working people out there. These are laborers, construction workers, nurses. You play the game when you working for them. This is your campaign. You're supposed to be in charge. It's time, Mays. I got to go. I love you, man, and I'm with you no matter what. Okay? Go get 'em. I'll see you out there, all right? All right. Hey, Mays... speak. Chicago, please welcome your next President, Alderman Mays Gilliam! What the hell is he doing? You know, they had a speech written for me... about what the people need, but you guys are the people. You know what you need. Yes, sir! Better jobs. Oh, yeah. Right on! Tell it! How many of you, right now, work two jobs just to have enough money to be broke? That ain't right. Sounds like my brother-in-law! If you work two jobs, and at the end of the week, you got just enough money to get your broke butt home, let me hear you say, "That ain't right!" That ain't right! How many of you have children that they call stupid? Don't be ashamed! It ain't your fault. I asked my niece the other day, "What's four plus four?" She said, "44." But that ain't her fault! That's the school's fault. Now, if your child's school has old-ass books and brand-new metal detectors, let me hear you say, "That ain't right!" That ain't right! That ain't right! It ain't right! And now we got these corporations stealing all the money. They ain't stealing their money. They stealing our money! The pension. You work for 35 years. You thought you was gonna leave your kids a will, now you gonna leave 'em a won't! You show up to get your pension, they give you a pen! Give you a damn pen! Now what the hell am I supposed to do with a pen? I should just stab you in the neck with this pen, Mr. Pension Taker. Get your hand out of my pocket! Taking everybody's pension and nobody going to jail. That'’s some bullshit, man. That'’s some bullshit. Meanwhile you or I, we steal a Big Mac with cheese, next thing you know we'’re on death row. How many of you work in a city you can't afford to live in? That ain't right! How many of you work in a mall that you can't afford to shop in? That ain't right! How many of you clean up a hotel you ain't never gonna be able to stay in? That ain't right! That ain't right! That ain't right! And we got nurses that work in hospitals that they can't even afford to get sick in. That ain't right! It ain't right! It ain't right! It ain't right! It isn't right! That shit is wrong. It's dead wrong! I'm Mays Gilliam, and I'm running for President of the United States of America. That ain't right! That ain't right! That ain't right! No questions. Sorry. Where's Mitch? Mays! Mays! Mays! You go to work. Handle your business. If you need me, you call me, hear? I'm gonna call you. Get that camera out of my face. Are you insane? You can't just go out in front of 5,000 people and just talk! And you said "shit." Presidential candidates do not say "shit." You show me a grown man that'’s never said "shit" and I'’ll show you somebody that'’s full of shit. Debra, hold on. What you just did, ...that was great.

You can't challenge Lewis on his record when Mays doesn't have one.How about a massage? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome presidential candidate Mays Gilliam! Yeah! Mays Gilliam, everybody! Thank you! Thank you! This is conservative talk 520. You're listening to Big Dave. Negative ads. Lewis is up, Gilliam is down. I think it's great! You know, bottom line, I don't think I'd want Gilliam and his homeys to be in the White House. Thank you! Thank you! People are saying these ads are dirty politics. I say give me a small break!

Mays! And, you know, if these ads are so bad, why hasn't Gilliam said anything? Caller... Howard Stern rocks! You're on with Big Dave. The reason Gilliam hasn't responded, is because he has too much integrity. Hey, Mays, we just got endorsements from Raekwon the Chef and Ghost Face Killa. Is this good? It's great.

So that means, even if he loses, he's the front-runner in 2008. Now, in case you've forgotten, I intend to run for President in 2008, and I am not running against him. So this is over. Now either you put a stop to it or I will. I came onboard to run a campaign for a man we didn't expect to win, not to sabotage him so he'd lose. Oh, come on, Debra, you're in this as thick as I am.

Muhammad, get me a gun in case another one of these kids tries to get crazy. This could work in our favor. Florida is a big Second Amendment state. This is serious, Mays. This is not the Player's Ball. Now, you can cut into Lewis' numbers here. Just talk about the kids, not about the guns. If I get shot, everybody's fired. Mr. Gilliam! One question here. Alderman Gilliam, there's been an outcry that something needs to be done about school violence. If you get into the White House, what do you plan to do about this? Well, I feel that we need to talk to our kids... Because our kids are... Excuse me. Hello, children. Good morning. I'm so sorry this happened. All right, pay attention. Bullshit 101. Ladies and gentlemen, our American children are hurting today and I think we need to reach out to them and give them all a good old-fashioned American hug. Now, America is the greatest country on the face of the earth. And I just want to say today, God bless America... and no place else. Thank you. Thank you, children. No more bombs now. And don't use guns. Now that went well. That was very touching. Kids really like me. You were very genuine. They responded. I tried to hug a girl and a boy so I wouldn't seem sexist. V.P. Lewis. Mr. Vice President. Well, welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam. I'm surprised you're not off somewhere with your little girlfriend. How'd you know about her? I'm the government, son. I know everything. Sir, we really should debate. Let's get something straight, Gilliam. I don't know you and I don't like you. Party's over, Gilliam. I'’m fixing to whup your ass, you got it? Sir, we really should debate! God bless America, and no place else! Sir, we just got this off the uplink. What is it? It's an off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam. Bad? Yes, sir. Good work. Oh, oh, it's on. You guys, come here. Vice President Lewis was on the scene comforting parents and students. Hello, my young Americans. The press is in Lewis' back pocket. Good morning, children. In this CNB News exclusive our cameras caught Gilliam making what was arguably the most controversial statement of the day. What? What do you expect? They act like us. We're bombing countries all the time. If I was 12, I'd probably have a gun, too. Tell me you didn't say that. I didn't know the camera was on me. I was just playing around with some sound guy. You didn't know the camera was on you? You didn't know the camera was on you? Of course the camera's on you! It's always on you! You're running for President! I told you right from the beginning. I don't want to hear another word from you. This is all your fault. Gilliam is now under investigation by the FBI for his involvement with this man, friend and associate and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor. Oh, Lord, we're going to jail. We're not going to jail. Is it true? Hey, what's up, Warren? I know him, but I don't "drug lord" know him. It's just a guy I see around the way I say, "What's up?" To. But I don't know him know him.

Do you have any idea why they chose you? We picked you because you're the guy that had... Shut up! You're here to lose, Mays. Arnot picked you so you could lose. Come on, Mays, just think about it. If they really had any idea that they could win this thing, do you think they would've chosen an ignorant-ass nigger like you? Okay, wait up.

So now you need a ride from an ignorant nigger? I am not getting off this bus. Apologize. No! Security! So you knew about this all along, huh? Mays... Is there trouble inside the Gilliam campaign? That's what Washington insiders want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor, Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail. Down in the polls, Gilliam still has no running mate. Sources say the Teamsters may endorse Lewis. Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsey? The big question: Where is Mays Gilliam? Where is Mays Gilliam? I'll tell you where he's at. He's with his peeps! Hello? Hey, you up? I was hoping you would call. Where are you? You okay? I don't know. I mean, I guess I'm all right. Okay, come on, talk to Mama. I don'’t know. It seems like they'’re trying to get me. Everywhere I turn they'’re trying to put a foot in my ass. Well, after what you said, you need a foot put up in your ass. I mean, what did you expect? They were just going to make you president? It's like they take a poll for everything I do. You ever been to a horse race? My dad, he used to take me all the time when I was little. You know, the horses, they wear blinders. They don't even see each other. They just run their race. So don't worry about Lewis. Don't worry about the press. Just... run your race. Okay, let me ask you something.Okay. What are you wearing? Oh, now, you know you need to stop. Man, news travels fast. Not ten minutes after you fired me, I had two offers for jobs. Good offers.What are you doing here? I know you got no reason to trust me, but I'm asking you to. You've got five weeks left. I know Lassiter is out, but I think... I think I can help you do this. I want to help you. And... I'm sorry, Mays. I don't know what else to say. But... as bad as things look, I don't think you should quit. Who said I was quitting? I wish I could quit. I wish it was that easy. You're lucky. You are so lucky. You don't know how good you got it. You just represent yourself. Me? I represent my whole race. If I quit, there won't be another black candidate for 50 years. All right. We can get rid of the school thing with a statement that'll blow things over but we need to pick a running mate. Well, who am I supposed to pick? Nobody wants to run with me. We need somebody we can trust. What...? Who do you trust? In the midst of his own Cinderella story, presidential candidate Mays Gilliam is shaking it up. He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam, a bail bondsman from Chicago, as his running mate. Political analysts say this may be too little, too late. Hi, I'm with the Pork Commission... ♪ Yeah, yeah...

First of all, there's no such thing as white-collar crime. And there's definitely no such thing as black-on-black crime. Crime is crime. Let me explain something to you. I don't care if you have a white collar or a tank top. If you rob me, I'm gonna whup you fast. I'm Janet Silvers, reporting live in Washington, D.C., where transit operators...

The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet. Our numbers are creeping back up. But if we want a real shot at this thing, we've got to get Lewis to debate. Well, he knows that, that's why he won't debate me. The guy's avoiding me like he owes me child support. The man is scared. Man, he's holding the ball hoping the clock will run out.

Welcome to New York City for the 2004 Presidential Debates. Where is he? I don't know. He said he was right behind me. Think I should go look for him? People are getting nervous. We've got to do something.I can do something. Ladies and gentlemen, Vice President Brian Lewis. Hello, Mr. Vice President! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Here they come, here they come. Sweet. Hello, Martin. I'm sorry I'm late. I had to change. Mr. Earl, nice to see you. Nice to see you, too, sir. Let's move. Mays, there are 250 million people out there deciding who to vote for. They all know Lewis didn'’t want to debate. Just show them why.Stay focussed. Take your time. If you get out of pocket, you put your foot in his ass. By the way, my suit. Faba? FUBU.Even I knew that. Mays. Ladies and gentlemen, Alderman Mays Gilliam. Yo, when Martin comin' on, man? My mama told me to whup your butt. ...the first question is directed by coin flip to the Vice President. Vice President Lewis, what steps should be taken to limit our youth's access to violent materials? Our American children's futures are at stake here. Now I say we need to study this issue and appropriate legislation that will return us to an America that we can be proud of. God bless America and no place else. Alderman Gilliam... same question, please. How do we limit violent material? Turn it off. And if the kids cut it back on, knock 'em out. That's why I don't smoke. When I was a kid, my daddy caught me smoking and he knocked me out. And to this day, I don't smoke. Not because I'm scared of cancer. I don't smoke 'cause I think my dad's gonna walk through that door and knock me the hell out. Knock out your kids. It helps. Yes! Vice President Lewis, with over 10,000 gun deaths per year in the United States, do you believe we need stricter gun control laws? I don't think we need more gun control. I say we enforce the laws that are already on the books. See, the problem is, nobody reads the books. What we need to do is start putting laws on videos. 'Cause everybody watches videos. MTV, BET. We need to put some laws on the Nelly video. If you had some laws on a Destiny's Child video right now, you could stop crime. We already have gun licensing. But that's only to carry the gun. I say we let the people decide. The people can't decide. The people are too busy getting shot in the ass. That's my brother. Well, that's another reason that I say he's not qualified. Why, 'cause I had the good sense to pick my big brother to be my running mate? All right, Alderman, I didn't come here to argue with you. Oh, yes, you did. We're having a debate. A debate ain't nothing but an argument. A debate isn't the same thing as an argument. Oh, yes, it is! No, it isn't! Oh, yes, it is! No, it isn't! I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? Can we just move on? This is ridiculous. Gentlemen, our next question comes from... I have a question. Would you like our reception to be buffet style or formal seating? Now, keep in mind, if you put Robert next to Nelson, he's going to be very angry because he wanted I love you so much... The candidates have agreed upon a short closing speech. Vice President Lewis won the coin toss. He has elected to go first. Thank you. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Tonight, you have seen two different men with two very different points of view battle to win your vote. And this is what America is all about. Now, as we've seen tonight, Alderman Gilliam can be captivating and... and entertaining. But America needs more than that from its commander in chief. To lead America, it takes experience. Now, I've been Vice President for the last eight years. I'm a war hero... and I'm Sharon Stone's cousin. And to me, America is like a fine performance car. And now is not the time... to turn this fine vehicle we call America over to the hands of an amateur. I'm Brian Lewis... and I am your last chance. God bless America, and no place else. Ah, yeah, it's over now. Why do you have to be so negative? Give me five. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Alderman Gilliam? Well, you're right, Vice President Lewis. I am an amateur. When it comes to creating so many enemies that we need billions of dollars to protect ourselves, yes, I'm an amateur. When it comes to paying farmers not to grow food while people in this country starve every day, yes, I'm an amateur. When it comes to creating a drug policy that makes crack and heroin cheaper than asthma and AIDS medicine, yes, I'm an amateur. But there's nothing wrong with being an amateur. The people that started the Underground Railroad were amateurs. Martin Luther King was an amateur. Have you ever been to Amateur Night at the Apollo? Some of the best talent in the world was there. James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell, the Crown Heights Affair... Hall and Oates! ...the Fat Boys, Rob Base. But you wouldn't know nothing about that. Why? 'Cause when it comes to judging talent and potential, you, my friend, are an amateur. I believe the Alderman is over his time. No, you don't. You had eight years to talk. Now is my turn. I'm gonna get mine. I'm getting mine! Ladies and gentlemen, hold your applause, please. How can you help the poor if you never been poor? How can you stop crime if you don't know no criminals? How can you make drug policy if you never smoked a chronic? How can you do that? Just a nickel bag. I'’m a real American. I've been high, I'’ve been robbed, I've been broke. My credit is horrible. They won't even take my cash! Now, you're always talking about "God bless America, and no place else," but isn't it obvious that God has blessed America? America is the richest, most powerful nation on Earth. If America was a woman, America would be a big-titted woman. And everybody loves a big-titted woman. So in closing, I'’d like to say you are full of shit. "God bless America and no place else." How about "God bless Haiti"? How about "God bless Africa"? How about "God bless Jamaica"? I'm not talking about Jamaica, the beach tribes y'all love, I'm talking about stabbing in Jamaica. That's what I'm talking about. So tonight, I want to say God bless America, and everybody else! The whole world! God bless you! I'm Mays Gilliam, and I'm running for President of the United States of America. Ya heard? Oh, yes! I told you! I told you! Yes! Oh, my God! Now we can watch Martin! Hello? Well, good morning, Mr. President. Hey! Wh-What time is it? I think it's a little after 7:00. Lisa, I need some help in here. Will you wait a damn minute? Mays, I was so proud of you. You were so good last night. Okay, L-Lisa, tonight I want to see you, okay? No-No matter what, win or lose, I want to see you. I don't know. I might have to work. But, look, if I don't see you tonight, I will see you soon. Just... run your race, get out there, and do what you got to do, okay? And I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.All right. It's Election Day, Tuesday... It is Election Day, and this is set to be... The stage is set for what is sure to be one of the most dramatic campaign finales of all time... The question everyone's asking is "Who will America vote for?" Lewis! I voted for Mays Gilliam. I voted for big business.I voted for Lewis. Who the fuck you think I'’m voting for? There appears to be an agreement between Washington, D.C., officials and transit authority operators regarding the shutdown of the Ninth Ward bus line. I don't see how they could do this to us. People got to make money. People got to get to work. Come on, show 'em how you do it. Show 'em how you do it. ♪ Hey, the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. ♪ You're not going to believe this. We got the Teamsters! That's great, little brother. They're going to announce at a press conference later today. All you have to do is show up, shake some hands, take some photographs, but it is yours. Mays, what's the matter? If they shut down this bus service, I will drive you to work myself. Can't do it. But it's Election Day! You have to pick up this endorsement. You said you want to win. You can't snub the Teamsters. Do you want 'em to endorse Lewis? I'm not worried about Lewis. I'm running my race. Go ahead, baby brother. I got this. Now, Mays... Now-- Debra! What? Y-Y-You-You just gonna let him go? He's a grown man. They shut down the whole bus line. What can he do about that? ♪ Oh, it's gettin' hot in here ♪ So hot ♪ So take off all your clothes ♪ I am gettin' so hot ♪ Oh ♪ I want to take my clothes off... ♪ In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis has 51 % of the vote. I'll bring him right back. He gotta vote. ...while Mays Gilliam is posting an impressive 47 %. Hey, hey, hey. You gotta get to the back of the bus. I'm just playing. Come on! He and Vice President Lewis are in a statistical dead heat. Come on! Vote, hoes! While Vice President Lewis and Mitch Gilliam have been working the campaign trail, Mays Gilliam has been out driving people to work. ♪ The roof, the roof is on fire! ♪ Why didn't somebody around here think of this? Why am I not out there driving a damn bus or something? Get me an SUV, or a minivan, or a bus, or a scooter, or a motorcycle, or a rickshaw. Get me some wheels, bitch! Are you going uptown? Come on, Mays! Wait a minute, Mays! Mays, I was thinking, we could write our own vows! Mays! I love you! I love you, Mays! With the polls just about 30 minutes from closing here on the East Coast, Mays Gilliam is actually ahead by several points. There is no question that Lewis has Texas. It seems clear Gilliam is going to take New York. Yeah! Yeah! New York! It's likely Lewis is going to take Michigan. It looks like Gilliam might just pull an upset in Illinois. Illinois! Illinois! Yeah! Go, Mays! This looks like it may come down to California. This looks like it may come down to California. This looks like it may come down to California. All right, I need to know. How real is this? Can we win without California? Well, sir, I still think we stand a good chance if you call in your connections to the energy companies. No, you can't win without California. What the hell are you doing here? Oh, shut up. You want to win, you'll do what I tell you. Gilliam has over 90 percent minority turnout. The whites are still the majority, but they're not voting. They don't like you. I like you, sir.Shut up. Okay. Well, what can we do to turn this around? There's about one- and-a-half hours left at the West Coast polls. If there's a leak saying Gilliam is going to win, you'll get a late rush. You get California, you get the election. It'll make the 6:30 news if we do it now. We just have to put it out there. Can we do this? We're the government. We can do anything. The race for President now turns to the West Coast. People, Armageddon is upon us, and Big Dave is scared! If the current voting trends sustain, it appears likely that for the first time in our history, a black man will become President of the United States of America. ♪ One, two... one, two, three, yeah! ♪ I have a dream that, one day... this nation will rise up and live up to the meaning of its dream. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Checkmate. I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear... I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear... The race for President is over. The race for President is over. The election is now over. The race for President...... is over. Mays Gilliam--ANCHORWOMAN: Brian Lewis-- Mays Gilliam--Brian Lewis-- The race for President is over.

What you were up against... The odds! Ooh, I can't wait to start working, and, boy, do I have a job for you. Wow! I don't know what to say. What department do you want me to work in? Finance? No, no, no, no, that's not good enough for you. Foreign Affairs? No, not Foreign Affairs. I thought you could do something real good in... Security! You suck! We'd like you to run for President. Sometimes, you don't know if people like you for you. Well, I like you for you. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Lisa! Mays! Get your hand off my ass, boy! Wait! Mays... Oh, my God, you are everywhere. Look at you! Okay, so, what's the first thing you're going to do, Mr. President? Well, the first thing I'm going to do is make you my First Lady. Mays, don't you play with me like that.

So let me get this straight. You're 18 years old. You go to war. You come back. Your leg is chopped off. You got a nub! Everywhere you go, they say, "Hey, what's up, nubby?" And you get to the bar, and you say, "Bartender, can I have a drink?" And he looks you up and down, and he says, "I gotta see some I.D." I.D.?! You mean to tell me a one-legged teenager can't have a drink? That ain't right! Where is the nub? Where is the nub? Prescription drugs, I'’m going to lower prices. Let me explain something else to you. You can survive a stroke. But the high prices of medicine will give you a heart attack. America is the richest, most powerful nation on Earth.

Ain't nothing ever been better than that! Most political pundits are saying that your brother destroyed any chance he had of winning this election by naming you as his running mate. Why did he do that? Why'd your brother pick you to be the anchorman? I don't have a brother. Oh, you said it was your brother at the time. I did my homework the same way you did yours. Okay? You got your job the same way I got mine. I'm not running for public office. And I'm not running for anchorman. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
