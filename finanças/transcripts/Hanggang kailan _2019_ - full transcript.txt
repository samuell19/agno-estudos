--== McEphie ==-- I can't box in my love for you. All my thoughts and emotions of love for you. Maybe, even more than that. If there was such a thing. Even time won't be able to erase it. All my how's and whys. Every time I'm defeated by fear and emotions, you are always the answer. With your hugs, I find peace. I apologize for the times I wanted to run and hide. But I stayed and I couldn't hide away. Because I always find myself smiling with you. Amidst the dozens of questions... I'll come back to you. If we were to go back, I wouldn't decide if it was okay or not. And if we were given another chance, I'd still choose to love you. You're going to hide it? Of course, I'm the one who keeps everything, right? Happy second anniversary, Pill. It's still our anniversary, Pill. Who would've thought that we'd be together for two years? Really now. Got you. Babe, I'm hungry. Okay, here. Here's a big serving. Make it smaller. Here. Don't be like that. You act like a baby. Thank you for this trip. You thought we weren't going to go? Yes, you were so busy because of your projects. Coming from someone who isn't busy? At least I blocked off these dates. You still accepted last minute projects. I still made this possible, right? Come on. Don't be sad, little girl. Love, you know I always make time for you. As you should. I got dizzy there. But thank you… Thank you for what? You'll be the one paying for this. This is all on you, you're paying. No, it's on you. I knew you'll be spending all my savings. But seriously… You're paying. Seriously. This bridge is long. Go down. No. Just go down. No. Come on, go down. No. Ouch. It feels nice here. You know, even if it's just the first day, it's so calming. It's nice to get away for a bit. Literally. Let's go there. Let's go. Let's go. Wait. No, no. Come on, please. You said you'd carry me. Okay. Go, go. This place recharges me. Charge up some more, you'll need it later tonight. Hey! Why? I'm thankful for you for bringing me here, but this is my plate and that's yours. I told you, this is okay. Whatever makes you happy. Okay, we'll talk later. No talking for now? No talking for now. It's like bread. I should stop being an event coordinator. You don't like it anymore? I can be a commercial model, look. Be sad. Be sad, but it's still delicious. It's delicious. Be happy. You're fooling me. Just do one more, be happy. No. Come on, one more. No. Delicious. No. I'll have your eggplant, okay? Just give it, I love eggplants. I'll give you mine. It's still alive! I'll feed it to you. Want me to dip it before feeding it to you. You started it. You're a pervert! I couldn't take the food seriously. You keep saying eggplant. Because I love you, I'll give you a piece. Feed it to me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Don't lead me on. Here. Eat it all. It's so quiet here. It's because we are the only ones allowed here. Okay. It's written outside, that this place is for couples. Since we're here in Japan, I started learning Japanese. - What do you call a rich Japanese? - What? When you want to do a toast, you should look at each other. Yeah, it's a sign of respect. It was done during the Ming Dynasty. What if you aren't looking? If you're not looking, it means you don't trust the person. Yes. If you're not looking at me, that means you don't trust me. That's why we toast, for the trust. Look at each other. Cheers. When there's beer-- When there's beer, there's a motive. - When there's wine... - When there's wine, you're mine. When there's coconut wine, something's going to happen. Easy. When there's sake?

But, Donnie… We can't fool ourselves. We're not fooling ourselves. You know that, right? Donnie, let me say it again. I'm happy when I'm with you. When I'm with you… But when you're gone… That's when all of the reasons why I shouldn't be happy flood in. Everything wrong floods my mind. I think about the truth. Donnie, I'm tired. I'm so tired. Donnie, let's just end this. Are you serious? Since when? Every time. I've always thought that someday… we'll eventually breakup. Even before going to Japan. I knew this was going to end soon. When I was packing. When I was heading to the airport. When we were on the plane. Donnie, this is it. Let's breakup while everything is still clear. While I can still breakup with you. Tired? Very. Want some coffee? I'll heat up the water. No need. It might be another reason why I can't sleep. Just kidding. Is there someone else? You really asked me that? Seriously. Kath... You'll know if there was. Kath, is this real? We talked about this before, remember? Sleep on it. You might change your mind later. Do you really want me to change my mind? If you were to ask me, of course. But that would be unfair. I wouldn't ask that from you. Thank you for dropping me off. I'll sign this then bring it to you tomorrow. Sure, no problem. It was on my way. Okay. Good night. Good night, take care. Thank you, again. Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Who brought you home? It was Dane. Wait a minute... Japanese! Your favorite. Thank you! I cooked something yesterday, good thing there are still leftovers. You didn't visit. Is he flirting with you? No. Then why did he drop you off? Kath! - Because... - Because? It's on the way. That was Dane from Elizondo Catering Services. We had a meeting earlier. I was on the way, so I went with him. Do you know, he's really nice. Even though he's rich, he is so down to Earth. Nice and down to Earth, so you do like him? No. What do you mean no? Isn't that what you want, someone who's nice and down to Earth, right? You went with him. You can tell me if you like him, it's not a problem. Are you jealous? I'm just asking because he dropped you off. You're just jealous, right? Why did you go with him? You are jealous. - I'm not… - You are jealous. You're so jealous. You're so jealous. - You're annoying. - You're jealous. Ouch. Sorry. You can tell me.

But if that happens, I promise I won't be bitter. What you're saying is, that these will only become memories? That always happens to every end of a relationship, right? It all becomes memories. It's unfair. It's like you don't believe in the faith of love. You're deciding on it too quickly. I'm just being realistic. But it doesn't mean that love isn't real. Are you trying to breakup with me? No, stupid. But if that happens, I won't regret loving you. I won't regret loving you, as well. Why don't I believe you? It's not real? It's real. It's really real.

Last two days on the trip. Last two days and last trip. But I want to request something on our last two days together. Can we both be happy? No fighting, no being sad. That's a difficult thing you're asking, Kath. Are you sure about that? It's hard, knowing that we're going to breakup. But we always do this, even knowing that one day we'll eventually breakup. Please give this to me. Can we do it on our last two days? Just be mine. Believe me or not, there will always be a part of me that belongs to you. It's hard to explain. Am I selfish for not being prepared? That I'm still hoping for you to change your mind. I think it would be worse if you didn't care at all, right? We've done this multiple times now, it's all the same. It's real this time, Pill. No one's going to call me that again. After two days… Pill, are you sure we can do this? I feel like I can't. I mean, sorry if I'm being clingy… We have to do it. Sorry, but I'm tired. Happy Anniversary. Are you mad? Happy Anniversary. Let's not fight ever again. It's your fault for getting mad at the smallest of things. My fault? There you go again. You're too serious. Next time that we breakup, let's make it real. Why? Because it's always the same, breakup then get back together. It just means one thing… That we're not okay. It just means that this is all for nothing. Okay. We are not going to breakup anymore. Unless we're truly serious about it. What was that? Maybe you do want to breakup with me. Get away from me. Don't think like that. Come here. Hey. We shouldn't be sad, right? We talked about this. It's hard. Is it easy for you? Not really, but… I don't want to be sad during our last two days together. Okay, let's do it like this. Let's list down all our favorite memories, can you do that? Seriously? How? My favorite… How? Memories, there are a lot. As many as you can. Kath, you're just making this more painful. Do we have to? I don't know. But for me, I want to answer my question. I liked it when you brought me sweet potato even though you weren't going to sleepover. Sir Ricky and I got close because of that. Sir Ricky. I liked how you got to know the bananaque seller. I don't like it when you asked me to turn the lights on when you're watching a scary movie. That's harsh. You're the one who's harsh. I'm tired from handling the event and then you'd ask me to stand and turn the lights on because you're scared of the horror movie. It was really scary, that's okay. You're a coward. I liked our long drives and sing-a-longs. I didn't quite liked those. I know where this is going. You are so full of yourself just because of your voice. Come on. Look. I got a 90, sometimes even a 95. Then, I liked it when… we'd dance in the rain. Then talked on the back of your pickup truck. I liked that as well. You're cheating. No copying of answers. But I liked it though. Nevermind. I liked it when you'd cook me Sinigang. I wouldn't have noticed. You get three cups of rice, every time. You were so expensive to buy rice for. What else? What are you doing? Thinking, don't disturb me. Someone might see you and throw us out. Wait, I'm thinking. Here… When you're watching a move, you're crying about it. Even though you've watched it ten times, you'd still cry. Of course. Why are you crying then? They died ten times, so I'm going to cry ten times. Then you'd make me poems, no one does that. When you're reading a book, you'd tell the story to me. It's as if I had read it. I remember my birthday, I liked that. I was so tired preparing for it. As in A for effort. I carried everything. I bought the balloons, then lined up for the cake. Happy Birthday. Sorry, I fell asleep. Did you cook all of this? Oh yeah, let's eat. I had dinner earlier, I already ate. Have you eaten? If not, I'll join you. No need to. I'm sure you're tired. Freshen up then go to sleep. Kath. I'm okay. I'll handle it. Thank you. Pill. Go to sleep. You sleep first, I'll follow you. Why? Did she organize your surprise birthday party? Who was there? Do you really want to talk about it? It's your birthday, there's no harm in talking about it. Mom was there, my college friends. My high school friends. Even though I hadn't seen them in a long time. Then this is my friend Arvin, he's also my thesis partner. We looked like fools back then, our thesis was about ghosts. Then the one in pink was my crush, I tried courting her. Did she answer you? She liked Arvin. Then these are? Your aunts and uncles? Her parents. Why are you frowning? Nothing. I just remembered something from a long time ago. Didn't she surprise you in a high-end restaurant? Both your parents were there. Your friends. I wanted to make you happy during that time. But I couldn't do it. This is her. And this is me. Kath. Kath, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I knew what I was getting myself into. Who am I to complain? Sometimes I think… what if I had met you first. Whenever you'd get into fights with her… Even though it's bad, I wished that you wouldn't get back together. I wanted you to breakup. Just because you've been together for a long time, doesn't mean that you'll end up together. But what can a two-year relationship do against a ten-year relationship? Since you were in high school, you already loved her. ♪ Thinking, wondering how all these things happened ♪ I'm not blaming you, I'm just stating facts. I knew what I was getting myself into. No one forced me. No one gave me false promises. I knew things were going to be hard. And I still did it. Even though I knew the ending, I still pushed through. Even though I had a lot of what ifs, I love you. I would bet everything that I have. When you remember me… and say how bad of a person I truly am, I'd understand. Don't be like that. Don't be guilty. If this was a trip… You'd already know where you're going. You already have a destination in mind. I'm… I'm the stopover. Stopover, really? Even so, you're the most beautiful stopover. You added color and fun to my travel. You said that we should only think about the happy things. We're going back to being sad, again. We wouldn't be happy if we weren't sad, right? I'm talking as if I'm drunk. Okay. Let's not list down our favorite memories, it kind of hurts. Let's complete the sentence instead? Complete the sentence. In the future, when I meet you again… I can do that. You go first, I can't think of anything. In the future when I meet you again, I hope that you're with your boyfriend. Or a brave husband, like me. Someone who'll be proud to introduce you to his friends. To his whole family. Because you deserve it. I'm sure they'll all like you. Because you're beautiful. You’re one beautiful soul. Then, when I see you with your boyfiend, all I'll think about is how lucky he is. But deep inside, I'll be jealous. So when you're going to look for a guy, find someone better than me. You're making me cry. Someone who is better than me. I’m selfish for wanting you. And I’m selfish to entertain that. Rabbits are difficult, because you don't know what they're feeling. Because they don't make a sound. They do make a sound. What? Not really. So you don't know if they're hurt, hungry, or maybe even dead. True enough, it was dead. And I was sad. I loved that rabbit. What did you name it? Jump. You thought hard on that one. I really thought hard on his name. Jump is a cute name, right? I had a cat, a stray one. A Filipino cat? Like someone crazy, he gets scared whenever he sees a lizard. Like that. But it was smart. When there was food, it won't do anything. It'd just stare. What was the food? Salt. Cheers. Cheers to us. But we knew each other in high school. We'd ride our service together. You still had a service in high school? Then I'd wait for my mom to sleep before watching TV. - So I could enjoy it. - Oh my God. My big brother did that, too. Really, big brother? Yes, big brother. You're probably two batches older. Our ages aren't that far. Two batches. Is that what you're feeling off from me? Go home, my child. But for real, you've been together for a long time. When I hear stories like that, it amazes me. When you're together for a long time, there are bumps on the road. Cracks on the wall. But it's all part of the journey. And still, you chose to love each other no matter what. But isn't love really just two imperfect people refusing to give up on each other. Where did you get that? Pinterest. But really, when will I find that? This is my room. We're near each other, I'm staying over there. It's near. I'll go now. I'll go too. Good… Yup, see ya. It's okay to kiss you on the cheek, right? I go this way. Good night. Bye.

Even if we don't acknowledge each other… I hope that we're at peace with each other. With our pasts. I just want you to be happy. To be truly happy in her arms. So whatever I'm feeling right now is worth it, right? You too. Of course, it wouldn't be fair if you're the only happy one. I'll come back here. To replace the memories. Me too. So, let's go home? Or do you want to stay until tomorrow? Let's stay. I'll miss this. I'll miss you. That's what I said, you just repeated me. Don't be like that. I softened my voice a bit, 'I'll miss you'. You don't want me to one up you now. I hope you'll never doubt what I felt for you. Because I really love you. But you love her more. It's not that… I can't measure it up. If only you can say, "I love you one-fourth or I love you three-fourths." Of course not. Don't be sarcastic. I believe that. I believe that you can love more than one person. But in your case, you've already decided on who you'd be responsible to. And it's not me. Ouch. That hurt. Call an ambulance, I'm dying. That really hurt. It's your fault. You picked a guy who had no balls. Maybe… We’re just meant to cross paths and not end up together. Right? A quote said… "Some people come to our lives and quickly go." "Some people stay for a while and leave footprints in our hearts." "And we are never ever the same." You did both. You went away quickly… But you also changed me. Even though… I hoped I did something good in your life. When you remember me, I hope it's not just the fights and pain. Of course. It's you, right? Even though it hurts. Because I always remember that you didn't choose me. I wasn't the one in the end. But I'd embrace that pain. The same time I'd embrace your feelings. It's a package deal.
