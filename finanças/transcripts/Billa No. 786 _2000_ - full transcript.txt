Keep it on top! - Hoard the luggage! Hey you fool, what's your name? - It's Tukaram. How much did you make? Come on, say it! How much did you make? Forty. - Loosen up a twenty. Come on, loosen it up! Keep it. Get lost! Hey scum bag. What's your name? - Gholu. How much did you make? - Sixty. Loosen up a thirty. Come on, loosen it up! Get lost. Hey you old fool! What's your name, you old goat? - Karmu. You are in for a loss. How much did you make? Didn't make anything today. Damn you! How dare you lie to Balu Tagda? I am not skillful in this job else, I wouldn't be a coolie today. Oh yeah! What would you be then? A Governor! Did you hear him? Now listen, you old goat. If you can't make any money then, ... you'd better quit this bus station. Get lost! Balu Tagda, learn to respect an old man. You wretched cur, you dare to teach me manners, huh? Inspector Singhania, here's your share. What's the matter, brother Balu Tagda? Day by day, your envelope seems to be loosing weight. Can't help it, Inspector. These days, the pockets of people too have lost weight. By the way, you get oil from the oil seeds only. I will ask why he bashed you up. Hey, this criminal is here already! - Yes, aunt Flora. Which criminal? And who are you? - Sir, I am Flora. This Balu Tagda beat up this Hanif coolie very badly. Write a complaint against him sir. - Yes sir. What are you saying? But Balu has pressed charges against all the ... coolies of the bus station that they beat him up very badly. Well Balu! See how much they have battered me! See for yourself! Balu Tagda has even given the names of many a witnesses. Sir, he is lying. Whatever he has said is all bogus. Why don't you file a report against Balu on behalf of Hanif coolie? The way she is ordering me around as if ... she is the Commissioner of Police. Go! I refuse to file your report. What will you do? Get out! But sir, I have made the inquiry against Balu Tagda. He forcibly extorts money from the coolies of the bus station ... and he has mercilessly battered up a coolie. Inspector Salim, you are crossing the limits. Who asked you to make the inquiry about this case? Sorry sir, you hadn't asked me to. But I listened to my conscience and went there. Conscience huh! Conscience is but the name of a pet monkey. Must be for you but for me, it is a true guide of my life. Shut up! During your police training, didn't you even learn ... how to speak to your seniors? - Sorry sir. And madam, you are still standing here? Get out from here! Get out! Hey, what are you looking at? He is a bloody corrupt beggar. Never mind now. Let's go. Go and do your duty. Have a seat. Thank you. - How everything else? Who is this pigeon? He is the same pigeon who was cooing in your area. Hope he is not the same guy ... whose string we have been asked to pull by Yusuf Dhabawala. Yes boss. It's him; Siddhu. - That's right. Siddhu. Brother Kalu, will you be trashing me with this whip? Hand me Rs. 10,000 of Yusuf Dhabawala ... and Rs. 5000 of my fees and walk out of that door. That means, Rs. 15,000! But, I don't even have 15 cents with me. Never mind then. Get ready to get whipped. You dare to create trouble in Kalu Ragda's locality! To hell with you! You rascal! Take heed if you ever dare again fool anyone in my area. Forgive me! I am catching the ears... I mean, my ears. I will never again create any trouble in your area. Just tell me from where to where lies your area. This entire Rampur area is my area except for that old bus stand. Does that mean, I can put up my shop outside the bus stand? Your shop? What shop? A shop of trick-n-treats. Just as you have your shop of bullying. All right. Now tell me, by when will you pay up Rs. 15,000? Let me first put up my shop. I will tell you the exact date after I see the sales. Can I leave now? - Just a minute, scum bag! Hear me loud and clear. This Kalu doesn't spare anyone who tries to trick him. Okay. I'd better make a move. - You better would. O Merciless One! Do cast thy mercy upon me too! When will Siddhu become successful? Haven't found a prey since morning. Wish I could find a victim. Oh wow! What a big city this is! Hey sister, lend me your ears. - What is it brother? This is the city of Rampur. This term is quite famous about the people of Rampur that Rampuris are very foxy. They eat bread but show it off as cake. Don't tell anyone that we have come from Jhumritalaiya. What then should I tell, brother? Just say, I am the gentleman from Patna and you are my sister Lajjo. What harm will it be if I say that we are from Jhumritalaiya? They will think us to be simpletons and rip us off. Here comes the prey. Thank God. Oh my God! Is this a house or the Himalaya mountain? Hey Hero, what are you looking at? Here comes the mosquito to suck our blood. Hey boss, what are you looking at? Who the hell are you to ask me what I see and what I don't see? I am a cop in plain clothes. - A cop in plain clothes! Yes mister. According to the Rampuri law section 420, ... it is against the law to see sky scrapers like this. Do you know that you will be fined Rs. 20 just to see one storey? What storey were you goggling at? I... Well, I was looking at the fifth floor. Fifth floor! All right then. Pay up the fine of Rs. 100 pronto. The fine of Rs. 100! Well, if there is such a law then I will have to pay. Here you go. No need to worry. See whatever you wish to see. The police will say nothing to you, get it! See you later. Oh great! Look at how the gentleman from Patna ... is laughing away after facing a loss of hundred rupees. What do I do if not laugh? Did you see how I fooled that cop? I was looking at the twentieth floor ... where else I told him the fifth floor. Wouldn't we have to pay up the fine of four hundred? That's just great brother! - I managed to save three hundred. Brother, you are so very smart! - Then what. Let's go. Hey, what's this? The jug is completely empty. I will bring the water rightaway. Hey girl, how about satisfying our hunger too? I would have certainly satisfied your hunger if it was for food. But it seems to me that you are craving for some thrashing. And only my brother Shankar can satisfy that hunger. Is that so? Where is your brother? - There... There is my brother. He is filling up the water from the tap. Is that your brother? He is already excused himself away. Sugriv, go and call brother Shankar. What do you say, brothers? How about meeting her brother too? Why not? We definitely will. Oh my God! Four of them! First tell me one thing. What do you four want? We four carry dead bodies. - Let's talk about death later. First tell me if you had seen the film, Aaj ka Arjun. We don't watch movies. - Then, let's watch it today. What's so special about that movie? The special thing is that, in that movie, ... some bad guys molests the hero's sister. The hero loses his mind and then, ... he teaches them such a lesson they never forget. What a tremendous fighter he is! Wow brother. You really satisfied their appetite. I truly did. - And the sister too... Let's have our lunch now. - Excuse me! Oh no! Here he comes again to suck our blood. Well mister, will we have to pay the fine for eating too? Not so brother. Seeing your mettle, ... I have decided to return back your hundred. This is the first cop I see who's returning back the money he took. Hey... Seems I dropped my purse somewhere. Here you go, brother. - Wow! Your monkeys' so dexterous Call him Sugriv and not a monkey. - Hello Mr. Sugriv! My name is Siddhu. And, what's yours? It's Shankar and she is my sister, Lajjo. Okay. Where have you come from? - We have come from Jhumritalaiya ... Patna. That's right. I am the Gentleman from Patna. Okay. Have you come looking for a job? Mister, if I don't work then, how will I get my sister married? I have come to Rampur in search of my aunt. Have you any place to stay in Rampur? We will live under the blue sky. We used to live like this back in Jhumritalaiya... In Patna too. No friend. I will never let you and your sister ... live like this out in the open. Come with me. Let's go. Did I make some mistake? No brother. You are so very smart. - Then what. Let's go. Please Siddhu. Take them somewhere else. Please aunt Flora. But, where will they go? Both these brother and sister are very sincere and honest. Sincere and honest like you! Mom... - Aunt, I give you their guarantee. Can't give his own guarantee and he's taking other's guarantee! Aunt Flora, for the sake of Mother Mary! Oh God! Siddhu, how many times have I told you ... not to involve Mother Mary in our matters. I shan't listen to you today at all. I just refuse to. Today even your trump card of Mother Mary failed you. By the way, how much rent do you owe? Since the past six months... - He can't afford his own rent ... and now, he's brought in two plus one; three more new tenants. I get it now. Your mother is refusing to rent them a room. Wait! Who asked you to leave? Can't you see the land lady is refusing? She is just the lady of my heart. I am the land lord, John D'souza. I am the gentleman from Patna, Shankar; alias Raju. She's my sister Lajjo. Both of you will be staying right here. What's this, John? I haven't set up a charity home. Try to remember Flora. Twenty years ago, when we didn't have ... any shelter, my boss Balwant Rai had given us this chawl. That's right. But today, shouldn't we too come to the aid of these homeless? What you say is true, John. My blood pressure just shot up. Come. Both you brother and sister stay in the room next door. Wow! What a monkey! He feels offended when he is addressed as a monkey. Address him as Mr. Sugriv. - Welcome Mr. Sugriv. Come on, let's go! - Don't feel offended. This is your room. Like it? - It's fantastic. Young man, why have you tied up those shoes to the stick? Why didn't you wear them in your feet? Madam, wouldn't they have got worn out if I had worn them in my feet? I would then have to buy a new pair. Look at the benefit of not wearing them. I had bought them four years ago and they are still as good as new. Am I not right, Lajjo? Brother, you are so very smart! - That's enough. I agree that you saved the cash but, ... you did wear off your hide, didn't you? Now tell me whether is not the hide more valuable than the money? You are right. - Now tell me who is more smarter? It's you. Brother Shankar is so dumb. No. Madam, today you have taught me a very good lesson. Now, I will wear the shoes in my feet only. Thank you aunt that you made them your tenants. I guarantee you that you will receive their rents on time. He will afford the rent only when he will do some job. Do you have any experience? - I can do any labour job. Very good. In that case Shankar, you will lack no job. Why fear when God is with you? Names Hanif. Can you lift heavy loads? If you say then, shall I lift you up and rotate you like a fan? Is that so? If you can lift me then, I can get you the job of a coolie at the bus stand tomorrow itself. Is that so? - Yes. Then, see what I can do. Congrats, brother Shankar! How do I look, brother Hanif? - Awesome! Brother Shankar, you are very lucky. Do you know what is the number of your badge? It's 786. In the movie `Deewar', wasn't the badge number of the hero also 786? Yes brother Shankar. This is a very sacred number. Do you know the meaning of this number? It means, `In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful'. Hey, the bus has arrived. Brother Shankar, the bus has arrived. You too begin your new job. What's this? Mr. Sugriv in the coolie's dress! But, where did you get this coolie uniform from? I stitched it for him. Now tell me this. How do I look as a coolie? Quite neat. Here's your lunch box. And here's my first pay. - Now, I will go. Let me have it sir. - Listen coolie. Better fix your wage first. Later on, you all create trouble. Don't you worry, sir. I am a coolie of a different kind. Pay me what you wish. Mr. Sugriv, take it please. Slowly... carefully. Take this. Is that all right? Come along now. Hand it over to me. Come on! Sir... Your purse. - Thank you. What are you doing, uncle? I will deliver these luggage. Come along sir. Here you go, uncle. Your wage. - What's this, son? You lifted the luggage and are giving me the wage! There is no greater wage then the blessings of the aged. God bless you, son! God bless you. I am forever indebted to you, son. Uncle, you should be resting at home in this age. Don't you have any son? - I have no son. I have ... three daughters and that too nubile. My wife is confined to bed. Son, if I don't work even for a day, we have to go without food. From today on, consider me to be your son. Whenever you have to lift something heavy, just call me. Carefully! Let's run! Hey, what's all this commotion about? Balu Tagda has come, brother Shankar. Balu Tagda! Is he some kind of an officer? He is no officer but the don of this locality. He come once in a week and snatches half of our earnings. I get it now. He extorts money! - Yes. I have seen that many a times in the Hindi movies. Look there. All the coolies have queued up to hand over his share. You too come along to pay him up. I too have come. Brother Shankar, quietly hand over half of your day's earnings to him. Son, last week when Hanif began to argue with him, ... he beat up this poor fellow a lot. Now, I will beat up this scum bag. Brother Shankar, did you say something? I was just saying that I will hand over half of my earnings to him. Go now. Hey! Seems like a new bird. Well handsome, what's your name? A friend of the poor; the life of the weaker. A Hindu by duty; a Muslim by fidelity. People call me Raju and yet, my name is Shankar. What's in the name, brother Baldy? I will show you my work. What did you call me? Did you call me a Baldy? Hey you pig's tail. I will pull out every hair in your body. Sir, how about taking the extortion from him first? We will skin him alive later. - What you say is right. Come on hero. Out with half of your today's earnings. Baldy, you must have certainly watched the movie `Khoon Pasina'. I did watch it. I watch every film; first day; first show with a free ticket. In that case, you must have watched it's the first day first show too. You may remember what the hero had said when asked by the hoodlums for the extortion. - I will tell you. He had said that he will pay up the extortion not outside but inside. Your memory is very sharp. Now consider that my body has been possessed by the soul of that ... movie's hero. And I will pay you the extortion in that bus. Follow me. - Go and take the money from him. Come along now. Damn you! Damn you! I am really tired, man! I am tired of thrashing up! Brothers, come and let him have some from you all too ... and pick up your belongings. Brother Shankar, why did you use only your left hand to beat him up? The reason be that he won't be able to bear the weight of this. Let's show him! - Will you again extort money from us? "Got a grand heart but am very ordinary" "Got a grand heart but am very ordinary" "Raju coolie, that's what I am, you see" "Raju coolie, that's what I am, you see" "Sweat on the brow shirt filthy and dirty" "Sweat on the brow shirt filthy and dirty" "Raju coolie, that's what I am, you see" "Raju coolie, that's what I am, you see" "I eat the bread of honesty and earn it working arduously" "I eat the bread of honesty and earn it working arduously" "In our hearts lies many a desires" "Like you we too are humans, sire" "We too are humans...

Hey you! - Hello sir. Where is the son of James Bond who beat up Balu Tagda? He was just singing here just a minute ago. What? He was singing after beating me up? Go and call him. I will make him sing. I will find him. - Go. - I too will sing a song. Brother Hanif. Shankar, the Inspector is here with Balu Tagda and Kalu Ragda. You deal with them. We will back you up. Don't you worry. I will wipe him out. Seems, Shankar coolie fled fearing the law. Balu Tagda, he couldn't sing our song. But, where will he escape from us? Let's go. Let's go man. Singhania, I didn't get it. First, that new coolie knocked out my brother Balu Tagda. And when we reached the bus stand, he fled from there. Kalu Ragda, the thing is that, ... seeing the cops even the most bravest of men lose their mettle. He is but an ordinary coolie. When he saw the cops, he took to his heels. Oh Bellamy! If I hadn't fled the bus stand then, ... how could I have enacted the scene of movie `Deewar' over here? Hey you! My name is Kalu Ragda. I beat up less but rub out more. Which scene of Deewar are you talking about? The same where the hero enters the ... godown of the villains and beats them up. The only difference is that, there the hero had locked up the door ... and here, I will leave the door open so that ... he who is makes it out alive can split ... and he who is left behind, the door to his life may shut forever. Brother Ragda, seems to me that this fellow is a film addict. For example, he showed the movie `Khoon Pasina' to your brother. And he is showing us `Deewar'! How about I show him the movie `Ghayal'? In that, the policeman beat up the hero to a paste. I think, this scene was before the interval. You have forgotten the scene after the interval in which the hero ... had chased the inspector on the road and pounded him like a dog. Do you remember? - Hey you scum bag! Hey you dirt bag! He hit me in the eye... He beat me so much! - Who is it? Oh! It's you. Come along. Sit down. - We will sit. Hey, what's the name of your boss? - Kalu Ragda. What will you come him from now on? - Kalu Langda (Kalu the Lame) What's the name of this inspector? - Arjun Singhania. What will you call him from today on? - Arjun Kaania (Arjun the Squint) Take them both to the hospital immediately. If they loose too much blood, they might die. Let's go boss. - Hey, be careful. Let go! - Else, I will beat you up less and rub you more. Handle me carefully! - Just walk sir. What's all this? Brother Shankar, I have told everything to aunt Flora. Here, quickly have some sweets. Kalu Ragda, the brother of Balu Tagda ... is a notorious gangster of this locality. You would better be careful of him. Uncle, I have broken one leg of Balu Tagda and turned him lame. And do you know that Inspector Singhania? I gave him a black eye and turned him into a one-eyed monster. Brother, you are so very smart! - Then what. Hey old man! Why become a coolie if you have no strength in your limbs? Why don't you sit back at home and pray to the Lord? I am sorry sir. I will pick it up rightaway. Sorry sir. I will sack him rightaway. You may go. - Come on, remove your uniform. Mr. Champaklal, have mercy on me! - Remove your badge! If you fired me then my wife and kids will die of hunger. I say, remove it! Mr. Champaklal, there won't be any more accidents. Will you remove it or not? - Please forgive me! How dare you raise your hands at the aged. Let go of my hand else, I will sack you too. And then, you will forget all your bullying. There, I left you. Now, make us take off our uniforms and badge. I will batter up your face so badly that ... even your family won't be able to recognize you, get it! You dare to threaten me! I will go right now and complain about you to the boss. He will fire you rightaway. I too will go to your boss and tell him that ... you take the bribe from Balu Tagda and rip off the poor coolies. My innocent Shankar. Balu Tagda too is one of the boss's men. Shocked, aren't you? You don't know the boss. Our boss appoints the coolies here on the job ... and his gangsters come here to extort the money from our coolies. And this Karmu has grown old. He is unable to lift weights. And, why will the boss bear his weight? And it's the boss's order to sack all the aged coolies. I shan't let that happen. Take me to your boss Pyaremohan. Welcome Mr. Dankeshwar Pyaremohan. Friends, this is my dream project. Which, me and you all, together in a partnership will make it possible. Which will consist of a five-star hotel; a shopping plaza; ... a housing complex and a swimming-pool. Are you all ready to finance this project? But Mr. Pyaremohan, I have heard that, a very big slum ... occupies that land of yours and a lot of people ... of lower class' been dwelling on it for years now. Correct sir. What you have heard is absolutely correct. Mr. Balwant Rai was the uncle of Mr. Pyaremohan. Twenty years ago, he had given this land to his driver John to reside. And John rented this land to many a tenants. I promise you all; just as my uncle returns back from his America tour ... I will have that land cleaned up of those infesting insects. Don't you believe me even now? - Correct. We have full faith in you. - We believe you completely. Here is your advance. Here you go. Congratulations! Now the complex will certainly be ready. Boss! Boss, this is Shankar coolie. He didn't like it when I sacked this Karmu. He has therefore come to meet you. Champaklal, I don't have the time to waste ... upon such blow Joes you bring along at any odd time. Great! You sure have made a great deal of money sir ... that you are thinking too great of yourself. Don't take me to be any Tom, Dick and Harry. Else, I will show you the scene from the movie `Coolie'. The scene from the movie `Coolie'! What was that? I will turn your room full of precious and valuable articles ... into a godown of junk. How about I show you a trailer? Amazing! You sure are full of mettle. I liked your style. Champaklal, never sack this old coolie ... because, I do not wish to upset Shankar. Well Shankar. Hope you have no more grievances now. Not at all, sir. You are such a gentleman. I will take your leave now. Good bye. Mr. Pyaremohan, you laid down your guns before our enemy. When a child wants to touch a lighted lantern in his prime ... he shouldn't be stopped. 'Cause only after he burns his hand upon touching the hot lantern glass ... will he realize the fact that he should think before he touches ... any bright and glittering object. What he said is absolutely right. He will deal with Shankar later. First, he will enjoy with this nymph of the heaven. Lokchand, you take care of me very well. All right, I will take some rest. Not some but take complete rest, Mr. Pyaremohan. My son Shankar, this is my very old friend. But mother, why are you giving me this photograph? When I die, you take Lajjo to Rampur search for aunt Sumitra. Mother... - And son, promise me that... you will get Lajjo married and marry Sumitra's daughter Pinky. Give me your word. But mother, I am but an uneducated and illiterate person. How will aunt Sumitra marry her daughter to me... She will marry her daughter to you only. Because in your childhood, it was she who had got you engaged. And son, aunt Sumitra is a very good lady. But as much as your aunt Sumitra is good, ... that much worse is her husband Virendra Singh. My son, it was this very Virendra Singh who ruined us. Before, he was your father's servant. Gradually, by duplicity, he took over your father's entire business. Your father could not bear this shock and succumbed to it. I got it mom. You therefore had to work so hard that ... you could not even educate us both brother and sister. Yes child. I as a mother could give you both no happiness. Son, give me your word that you will marry only Pinky. I give you my word. Mother! - Mother... Aunt Sumitra, now where do I find you in this huge city of Rampur? Hey come on! Get in front. - Move aside, will you? Sir, shall I get the baggage? - Sir, do you want a coolie? Sir... Madam, shall I get your bag? Madam, I will lift it. Madam... Heck no... I will get your bags. I will take her bags... - What are you saying? Pinky, one hair of woman draws more than a team of oxen. I will lift it. - Whom shall we ask to take the bags? I will. Hey coolie! Come over here. Can't you hear me? Are you deaf? Come here! What do you say mister. Seems, this fair lady is calling me. I am not deaf but will surely turn deaf if you yell out so loudly. Oh Bellamy! The English are gone but left back their kin. What are you murmuring to yourself? Nothing. Must be your ears are ringing. Quickly pick up my luggage and carry it to our car. Oh my God! It's in English. - What happened brother Shankar? Could you read it please? - I know this address. Let's go then. - Yes, let's go. Oh wow! How big my girl has grown up to be! How smart has she become. May you be safe from all evil eyes. First tell me how was your journey? I enjoyed it a lot. - Oh really! Have you come all alone? Hasn't your friend come along? She has come. - Oh really! Listen to me dear. I have got you a body spray from Paris. See this. Did you like it? - Wow! Excellent. My father uses the best of the body sprays in the world. Really! Wow my dear Pinky. Wow! Thank you. Hey coolie! What are you doing over here? This photo... - It's of my late wife, Sumitra. Late! - Yes but why are you asking? What's your intention? Hope you haven't come here to seek charity. You rich folks see every poor man as thief. I haven't come to ask for anything but to give instead. Hold your bag that you had left behind at the bus stand. Hey coolie, here's your tip. I don't want the tip but the tipper. Hey coolie, what are you murmuring to yourself? What do I say to you now, sir? I have a very bad habit of talking to myself. But this habit is found amongst the insane. Do I look insane to you? Hey coolie, better talk from a distance. Your clothes are stinking If I want then I can even show you a piece of my insanity. But, I will have to honour the relationship. The honour of the relationship! Virendra Singh, I didn't get what he said. What relation was he talking about? What relation could I have with a coolie? Really brother! Did you find aunt Sumitra? Yes Lajjo but the sad thing is that, she is no more. Did you meet Pinky? I did but I didn't tell her anything about myself. Why not? You could have atleast told her about the engagement. I will. What the hurry? What if you are not in a hurry but we sisters ... are always in a hurry to bring home a sister-in-law I am going now with Mr. Sugriv to the temple. To the temple! What for? Oh brother! I had made a vow that I will break a coconut ... in the feet of the Goddess the day we find aunt Sumitra and Pinky. The temple! I too will go to the temple. To the temple I will go! Siddhu, today, you will have to use the formula no. 44 to woo Lajjo. Hey Siddhu, why are you hanging yourself? No one can stop me now from hanging myself. Because, not one but three girls jilted me. Take a look for yourself. Mr. Sugriv sure is very smart. Hey Siddhu, they look like movie actresses. How can they ever dump you? Oops! She knows them all. Better think of a new formula. Yes... Lajjo, they are not film actresses but their look-alikes. I get it! He's trying to inveigle me with a different new technique. Hey Siddhu, why are you wasting your time after these girls? It is they who should hang themselves to death. You are right, I am coming. My Lajjo, I am coming. These three broke my heart to pieces. I will then join it back, darling. Darling! Did you just call me darling? But, how will you join it? With the stick-fast; cello-tape; fevicol; rope; do tell me! With the adhesive to join back broken hearts.

Disgusting! Mr. Sugriv, inform my sister that her brother has come. Brother Shankar! Brother, Siddhu is very depressed. Not one but three girls have jilted him. What? Oh Bellamy! He fell in love with three girls! That means, he changes tracks very fast. He slips every times he sees a new girl, doesn't he? Not once but, I fell in love one after another. When the first one dumped me, I fell in love with the second one. When the second one ditched me, I fell in love with the third one. And then... Then the third one too deserted me. So you hooked the fourth one. Do show me who were those three girls. I will show you. Let me have it. - Oh no! What's the need to show? Let brother see them too. Take this. So, these three girls dumped you! And because of being dumped thrice, Siddhu's heart broke into pieces. And you were sticking back those pieces? What else was I supposed to do? He was about to hang himself. That's right. - Siddhu, you sure are good at this game. You sure convinced my sister ... by showing the snaps of these three actresses. Please forgive me, brother Shankar. You shut up! - English! Don't you be surprised. Nowadays, I too am learning English. Bear in mind. I own this train. Don't you dare try to change tracks now. First earn some money and then, I will get you both married. All right brother Shankar. See you later. Brother, you are so very smart! Then what. Let's go. Really Jagga! Has my uncle returned from the America tour? Yes boss. And on arrival, you were the first thing he inquired about. That means, that old man will definitely come here to check on me Mr. Pyaremohan, today somehow or the other,... ... get your uncle to sign the title deed of that land to you. Man, it's very difficult to make that old Shylock agree to my terms ... because he has found out everything about me. Uncle, hello. - Hello. Uncle, take everything from me but please, ... transfer the title-deed of that slum land to me so that ... I may lead a humble life on little. I want to leave you dead-beat with nothing. I know all your ploys. I had found out about your misdeeds back in America itself. I am going to my solicitor right now ... to make a fresh will through which you won't get even a penny. And especially that land which you so much drool for. I am registering that very land to John so that ... you may have a peaceful sleep and be rid of all your troubles. From today on, I have nothing to do with you, get it! Who are you? Sir! Uncle John was a very good man. Even the whole life time will fall short to mourn for him. By Mother Mary, my John was a perfect gentleman, Shankar. What's beating? He never even scolded me ever in my life. I can never forget my John... Never. My mother succumbed to miseries. Now, you are our mother. If you kept crying then we kids will consider ourselves orphaned. No, never. Do not consider yourselves as orphans. I will make this place very well; establish it very nicely. This was the dream of my John. Serious problem aunt Flora. Pyaremohan, the nephew of Mr. Balwant Rai, ... the landlord of this colony has come with many men. His intentions does not seem to be good. Don't you worry. I will see to it. I am Pyaremohan, the nephew of Mr. Balwant Rai. After his death, I have now become the owner of this land. The land that you have occupied like insects; I have come here... ... to ask you all to vacate this land and go away from here. But, where should we go? Madam Flora, we will settle you all ... on the mountain of Tilakpur that 20 kms. away from here. No problem then. By the way Mr. Dankeshwar,... ... what's the hurry to vacate this place so urgently ... that you couldn't even wait for a few days to pass? I don't think I need to answer such a despicable man like you. I haven't come here to fight. I am therefore telling you this. I want to build a very big hotel and a housing complex on this land. Do you know what a housing complex is? Do you know English? That's strange! I had heard that this fellow was an illiterate. Shut up scum bag! Even kindergarten kids knows this much English. Anyway, I wish to give you an advice. Why don't you build this hotel and complex of yours ... on the mountain of Tilakpur and let us live here in peace? Don't be so stubborn man! We will give you lots of money if you vacated this place ... so that every one of you can build their own homes. You will have to wait a little longer to get this place evacuated. How long? - Just till the next life. Spare the rod and spoil the child. I will have this place evacuated of you people at any cost. Even if it costs you your life. Let's go. Let me too see how you have this place evacuated with me around. Sir, please buy the incense stick. - Not interested. Sir, it's just for Rs. 2. Didn't I tell you that I don't want it? Sir, if you but the incense stick from me then, ... you will surely get married to Pinky. Yes, I am telling you the truth. I swear by the incense stick. Siddhu, you are selling incense sticks! That's right, brother Shankar. Didn't you only ask me to get a job Didn't you like it? I liked it so much that I won't buy one but five of them. Take this I too will have two. Brother Hanif! Take it gladly; champa and jasmine. Brother Hanif, are you buying it just because you really need them ... or is it just to help me out? God forbid! What are you saying, brother Siddhu? Every Thursday, I visit the shrine of Saint Makhdoom ... and light up the incense sticks and offer the blanket of flowers. And today is Thursday. - Brother Hanif, offer ... the incense sticks and the blanket of flowers on my behalf too Brother Shankar, it's a family matter. I will do it. Oh no! I do not believe in credits. Here, hold this. All right then. Good bye. - Good bye. Stop! - What happened? What's the matter, Shankar? Why did you stop the car? I want to have an important word with you. With me? Do say it then. - Can't say it before someone. Please come here. Pinky, you go home. I will talk to him and come home. You are not going to step out of the car. Whatever he has to say, he will say it right here. How can I just say it like that? It's private. Please Shankar, do say it. I have written a poem dedicated to you. Shall I say it? A poem! Do say it. Oh Bellamy! What an exceptional beauty have you. Know not what I am going through since the time I have seen you. Your gait is so graceful like a dear, my dear. Oh Bellamy! Merely sweet sixteen you look, my dear. How is it? - It's awesome! If you liked it then, how about having lunch with me in a hotel? Come. - Pinky, you carry on. I will see you later. I won't allow you to go with that coolie. I do not need your permission either, get it! And anyway, this is my personal matter. Shut up! - You shut up! Madam Anjali, I wish to have a word with you. Say it. - I had written that poem for Madam Pinky. I love her a lot. You idiot! Why then did you talk romance with me? I will kill you! Just a minute, madam. First hear my story and then do as you wish. Shankar, were you really engaged to Pinky in your childhood itself? And, had her father betrayed your family so badly? What's done is done. Now I only want to fulfill the promise I made to my dying mother. Don't you worry, Shankar. You will definitely get married to Pinky ... and I will assist you in this matter. You will definitely become the groom and she your bride. Oh Bellamy! Hey Shankar! What's this? Shut up Madam! How are you Shankar? - I am fine. Why these flowers? They are for you. - What for? Don't you know when does a girl present the flowers to a man? Does that mean that you... Yes Shankar. Slowly I realized that I am falling in love with you ... and can't live without you. Oh Bellamy! - You like me too, don't you? I like you very much but it's Madam Anjali that I love. What? You love Anjali! - She too likes me very much. Is that witch more beautiful than me? Listen madam. I don't go for looks. Anjali has a very beautiful soul. Hey! Why get so piqued? You can't force me. I can love anybody I want. All right. I will jump over the bus at this very moment. Hey! What are you doing? Move aside! Nobody can stop me now from dying. - I can stop you. "O fair lady..."

That scoundrel! - Whom are you cursing, child? I am cursing this fellow Purshottam ... whose news has been published in the paper. What's published? - The cops nabbed him procuring the girls. Procuring the girls! That's right. Where else, he himself has a young daughter. Such fathers should be shot. All right. Now, if you are ready to go to your S.T.D job ... then, shall I drop you there? - No dad. Can you wait an hour? Not an hour. I have to attend the party of Pyaremohan. All right dad. Sir if I could help it, I would have signed this land to you .. in a minute and would have filled my pockets with these green stuffs. But, I am helpless. After father's death, everything has gone to mom. How about we send your mother to your father? Sir, you will nothing of the sort with my mom. All right. Surprising Bobby. You need money as well as mummy. Now when you have become a good friend of ours we will do nothing such to harm your mother. Okay! Thank you very much sir. But dear brother, we will have to do something or the other ... to get hold of that land, won't we? We will have to make a master plan. Make such a solid plan that even that Shankar can not sabotage it. Mother! Mother! Son, you have not fulfilled your promise. Promise! - Forgot so soon, son! The promise that you made at my death bed... Oh! That promise! I remember it. But mother, aunt Sumitra is... I know it. Go to Pinky's father and demand your rights. All right. I will go tomorrow itself to Pinky's father ... and seek Pinky's hand. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! What happened brother? Whom are you talking to? Mom had come in my dream. She was saying that... I know it brother. Mother must be saying that get married soon and bring Pinky home. Yes Lajjo. I will go to Pinky's father tomorrow itself ... and seek Pinky's hand. A pathetic coolie has come to seek ... the hand of a wealthy builder's daughter! If a servant can take over his master's position then ... why can't a coolie seek the hand of a rich builder's daughter? Hey! Which servant and which master are you talking about? Virendra Singh, you were the servant and ... the master was my late respectable father, Jagannath Seth ... whose entire business you took over by duplicity. My father could not bear this shock and succumbed to it. Mother saw such a drastic period of poverty that ... we were completely impoverished. Me and my sis were unable to afford education and remained illiterate. And then, you made your last move. You broke the childhood engagement of me and Pinky. And now you want me to rebind that broken bond? Sir, you will have to bind this bond. Do you know why? Because me and Pinky have fallen in love with each other. I understand now. You must have used your childhood story ... as your trump card and convinced Pinky. Even before I could tell this story, Pinky fell in love with me. The reason why I did not tell this story to Pinky was, so that ... a father may not have to face embarrassment before his daughter. Hey boy! Don't you try to make me emotional. Because, my daughter hasn't lost her mind ... to have fallen in love with a man like you. Pinky, this coolie has come to seek your hand in marriage. He claims that you too are in love with him. Love and with this pathetic coolie! Sure I trifled with him. Any special reason for that sham? He humiliated me many a times and then I decided to avenge myself. Forget marriage. I won't even like to spit on him. Come to your senses, Pinky. What's this you are saying? Shankar, didn't you hear what my daughter just said? Shankar wait. When Pinky will hear of your childhood story ... from me then at that time, she won't spit on you but on her dad. Anjali, dare if you said anything to Pinky. You too, right at this very moment, pack up and leave for Dehradun. Are you still standing here? You can understand English, can't you? Daddy, where did Anjali go? - How would I know where she went? Daddy! - Pinky dear, is that you? She packed up and left for Dehradun. I am going to the bus station to stop her. I truly believe that after hearing your childhood story and ... after learning of your engagement, ... Pinky will surely accept your proposal. No madam. I don't want Pinky to have pity on me ... and give her love to me as a charity. Let's go. - Go now. Had Anjali come here? She had and she boarded the bus and is now off to Dehradun. But madam, where do you think you are going? What do you need from me? Shankar doesn't keep no credit. I will repay your debt. You owe nothing to me. - You have broken my loving heart. Now, this broken heart will curse you that ... till you are sixty year old you will not get married. What rubbish are you saying? And even if you do get married then you will get married ... to such an old man haggard. - You bloody fool! And even if you did get married, you will crave for kids. And even if you did bear kids then, what difference does it make? Your hubby will get a new wife. - You scoundrel! I will kill you! What's that? - You tore up my uniform! You will have to stitch it up right now. Get it stitched from a tailor. It's you who has torn it. Then, it's you who will have to stitch it. Shankar, whom have you brought? - It's Pinky. Brother, did you bring my sister-in-law? Heck no! She is not fit to be your sister-in-law. She claws like a wild kitty. Take a look at this. But, why then have you brought here here? Hey aunt Flora, she has torn up my uniform into tetters. Bring the needle and thread. Until and unless she doesn't stitch it up into one piece, ... she can't leave here. I will get the needle and thread. Here you go sister-in-law; the needle and the thread. Sister-in-law! My foot! The more you delay, the more you will have to wait. Think about it. Take off your shirt. - Not here. Let's go inside. Brother, you are so very smart! - Then what. Let's go. My child, how about having some food? Who the heck wants to eat the cheap food of such cheap people like you? Madam, when you will feel the pangs of hunger, ... you will find this same cheap food as the best food in the world. Let's go mother. Let's have our dinner. - Yes lets. How come my mother's photographs are over here? I cannot tell you. Brother Shankar has asked me not to tell you. Please Lajjo, do tell me. You have got to tell me. If you really wish to know then first, ... better see the photographs of your childhood engagement too. Look at this. - My goodness! Who is my groom? Brother Shankar. - Shankar! And here is your father who was the servant of my father. And that day, brother Shankar promised mother that ... he will marry only you or not at all. Inspector, do believe me. I am telling you the truth. Believe me! - Father-in-law! Hey, move aside, will you? Why pretend to touch my feet? Inspector, he is the same coolie who has kidnapped my daughter. He has unlawfully imprisoned her in this house. Inspector wait! Here's my girl! Come here my doll! Come to me, my child! Neither has Shankar kidnapped me nor has he imprisoned me unlawfully. Inspector, I have come here of my own free will. What are you saying, dear? Mr. Virendra, your daughter is mature ... and neither is she charging him of anything. I cannot arrest Shankar. Please forgive me. I would have forgiven you back there if I had to. What's for? What if she's mature? She is my daughter. I will take... Mister, if the fair lady doesn't wish to go from here then, ... no one in the world can make her. Not even me? Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go brothers. Oh my God! Yes, pack this. Aunt Flora, where are you off to so early in the morning? Shankar, I received a telegram from my father from Goa. He is seriously ill. I'll have to leave for Goa rightaway with Bobby. But, where is Bobby? He is waiting for me at the taxi stand. Aunt Flora, give my regards to your father and ... tell him that I will pray to Lord Shiva that he gets better soon. All right then, I will leave now. You take care of yourselves. Who put this in the middle of the road? Who is it? Who are you people? Mother! He will be hurt. - Hey old woman! Sign his paper. Why so? What have you written in it? Read it for yourself. - How will I read it? I left my glasses back at home. Bobby, could you please read out what's written in it? Mom, this is a ransom letter in the name of our tenants. Until and unless they don't pay up Rs. 50,000, they won't set us free. I will not sign this paper. - Mom! I beg you not to hurt him please. I will sign it. Please don't sign it mom! - I will sign it. Let me sign. Take this man. O my innocent mother! You have made a terrible mistake ... by signing this Power of Attorney to my name. Now, I can sell this colony anytime. By Mother Mary, I will not leave you! Give me that paper! Worship Mother Mary in this Home of the Aged. You will face no problem here. And I am leaving behind Rs. 5000 for your sustenance. Bobby, what you are doing is not good. Don't take my curse, Bobby. What's the matter? Why are you crying? Brother Shankar, aunt Flora is no more. How can this be possible? Just two days back she went to Goa in a fitful condition. Brother Shankar, when I reached Goa with mummy, ... my grandfather had already passed away. Mom shrieked with shock and fell on his dead body suffering an attack. I took her immediately to the hospital. When she regained consciousness for just a couple of minutes, ... she signed this authority letter to me. And then she suffered another attack and passed away. Brother Shankar, I am now orphaned. Oh Bellamy! I smell something fishy. Bobby is not that straight. What's up man? You are now the owner of this entire property. Man you look so great! What do you say man? Whose purse is that? Looks like Bobbys'. Shankar, look at this. Looks like some kind of a receipt. If only I could read. Now, you only tell me what receipt it is. It's some kind of a Home for the Aged people. That means, an asylum for the Aged. It's mentioned that Rs. 5000 has been deposited ... in the name of Flora Rodriguez. Brother Shankar, I have seen the board of this name ... on the highway leading to Goa. Hope Bobby hasn't imprisoned aunt Flora in there. Here's my move. How the hell did you get in here? - Who are you people? I am Dr. Backbreaker Bonecruncher. And I am his compounder, Mr. Lime Squash. Backbreaker! Bonecruncher! Lime Squash! Hey, what nonsense are you both saying? Hey! I don't do nonsense. I do only surgery. Somebody called me from this place saying that there's a couple of ... emergency cases here that's to be taken to the hospital. Emergency case! - Hey, what do you mean? Hey compounder! - Don't you know what an emergency case is? I will explain. If you happen to break your neck of ribs then ... you will be considered an emergency case. Somebody must have played a joke on you. We haven't broken our bones If not yet then you will. Hey Doctor, what did you whisper to him? I am trying to remember the name of a movie. Which film? - Trishul. Have you seen it? Yes, I have seen it. There was a scene in that film in which, the hero ... brings along an ambulance to fight with the bad guys. So, you have come to thrash us? This is the first time I am seeing an intelligent bad guy. The thrashing will continue till the time ... you don't hand over a lady named Flora ... whom you have imprisoned here unlawfully. So, to make this an emergency case, ... I will beat you up so much that you will shit in your pants. Hey, you hit me? Damn you! - How dare you hit me? Take this and this... Hey, we are fighting amongst ourselves. - The doctor... Hey, open it up! Damn you! Aunt Flora! I have come to take you home, aunt Flora. Don't call me aunt. Call me Mother. My son handed me over to the thugs for the property. And though being a stranger, you came to free me from this place! Let's go mother. Listen residents of the colony! If I wanted to double-cross you, ... I could have secretly made a deal with this rich man. But I wish to remain neat and clean and believe in a fair deal. Therefore, before everyone present here ... I am handing over this land to it's rightful true owner, ... Mr. Pyaremohan, alias Dankeshwar. Mr. Dankeshwar is such a lovely person ... and the biggest proof of which is, he is giving ... Rs. 10,000 to all the tenants of the colony with best wishes. Dirty monkey! Does anyone has a pen? - Here, take this. What a strange monkey this is. Today, I will not leave you alive. Your mother is still alive and you were signing on her property papers How aptly had the Wise Men said. It's sad when you don't have any child. It's agonizing when you get a child and he dies. And if the child is born and turns out to be bad then, ... your misery knows no bounds. Why are you staring like this? Have I robbed you? This coolie is the cause of all this trouble. I will see you. Let's go. Oh great! That sleaze created all the trouble and blamed me instead. Well Lajjo! Brother, you are so very smart! - Then what. Thy beauty is, oh what do I say? Tantalizes my body and mind, you see. Seeing you, O beautiful damsel, This man from Patna craves for thee. "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "Sweet love drips from your beauty making your darling crave for thee" "Sweet love drips from your beauty making your darling crave for thee" "For the first time my darling came on the bed" "For the first time my darling came on the bed" "Seeing me all adorned, makes my darling crave for me" "Seeing you all adorned, makes your darling crave for thee" "Sweetness drips from my beauty makes my darling crave for me" "For the first time my darling raised the scarf" "For the first time my darling raised the scarf" "Seeing my beautified face makes my darling crave for me" "Seeing your beautified face makes your darling crave for thee" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "For the first time, my darling gazed into my gaze" "For the first time, my darling gazed into my gaze" "To fall in love with me making my darling crave for me" "To fall in love with thee making your darling crave for thee" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "For the first time, my darling took me into his arms" "For the first time, my darling took me into his arms" "I made a lot of fuss making my darling crave for me" "You made a lot of fuss making your darling crave for thee" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "For the first time, my darling snuggled up with me" "For the first time, my darling snuggled up with me" "To feel my youthful love makes my darling crave for me" "To feel my youthful love makes my darling crave for me" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" "Sweetness drips from my beauty making my darling crave for me" Here comes the bus. Get off! - I will hold it. Let me hold it sir. Son, I wish to go to Dr. Vidya's Nursing Home. All right. Come, I will take you there. Who is Shankar coolie? - Who are you people? What business have you with Shankar coolie? Ask any more questions and I will put this slug into your head. Tell me who is Shankar coolie. Tell me! Now tell me, how was the joke? Now tell me, who is Shankar coolie amongst these? Tell me else, you will die for no reason at all. Kill me if you wish but, I will never tell you who Shankar is. Brother Shankar, my younger sister's marriage has been fixed. I have brought you the sweets of her engagement. That's wonderful! Uncle, have this. They both are brutal murderers! They have definitely come here to kill me. Hey Shankar, kill them both and win two hundred thousand rupees. And then, your sister Lajjo will get married very easily. Impossible Mr. Pyaremohan. Ranganath and Jagannath will never fail in killing Shankar. They have not only failed but Shankar also sent them to hell. And you, sitting there in the police station, ... prepare to hand over the prize money on their heads to Shankar. That's enough, Mr. Pyaremohan. You are not aware of the tactics of the cops. I will make such a move that Shankar too will go to them. Oh really! Did you really kill both those wanted criminals? What else could I do? If I hadn't killed them then, they would have ended my life. How true! - Shankar, Mother Mary saved your life. Shankar coolie, I have come to arrest you for double murders. You are talking about arresting me! Haven't you seen the wanted posters ... put up on the bus station and the police station? Either dead or alive, each have a bounty ... of one hundred thousand rupees on their heads. First, hand over the bounty of two hundred thousand rupees. First, take a look at both the dead bodies ... and then we will decide whether to reward you or not. These dead bodies are of Dharma and Karma ... who had molested your sister. You had beaten them up a lot at that time ... and had even threatened to kill them, hadn't you? This is all a lie. These are not those two. The police have many such witnesses who saw you killing these both. Your witnesses are liars. You are a liar. You are fraud. Where have you hidden the dead bodies of those two or, ... do you wish to rob me of my bounty? Hey, I have with me the warrant to arrest you. Say whatever you wish to in the court of law. Oh that I will. I will tell everything. I am afraid of no one. Why should I fear if I am not wrong? Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Inspector, this is not the police station. Where have you brought me? Move it! How are you? You did encage the lion after all, Singhania. Mr. Dankeshwar, do you know that he wants the bounty of two hundred ... thousand that was on the head of Jagannathan and Ranganathan? I will reward him with a greater bounty. You have killed my men in the style of hit movies. Now, I will show you a film; Sholay. Have you seen it? Seen it many a times. Which scene will you show me? The scene in which, the villain Gabbar Singh ... amputates the Thakur arms with the sword. Get the sword! Just a minute, Mr. Dankeshwar. If you dismember his arms then, what's left? Let us first collect our dues from him. Before we collect our dues, we should first snatch away his power. Does he have some special power with him? I will tell you, Mr. Pyaremohan. His special power is this badge of his, the number of which is 786. Beat him more. Beat me! Beat me more but, do not leave me alive. If I make it alive then, I will hunt you down ... to the end of the world and kill you all one by one. Only if you make it alive. Hold it for a minute. Listen to a good news. Just now Bobby informed me that ... the advocate has filed a case against the colony dwellers ... of whom this Shankar considers himself as the leader. Within 15 days, if the colony people fail to surrender 1 million ... against the rent for 20 years in the court then, ... they will have to evacuate the colony. And I think, this is way beyond the capabilities of such destitutes. Beggars cannot be choosers. Shankar will watch it with his very own eyes that ... the colony has come into our hands. And then shall we put out the lights in his life. The slum dwellers of Bharat Nagar Slum are being warned from .. the Court that they deposit the rent of this land of past 20 years ... that comes to around 1 million rupees ... into the State Treasury within 15 days from now else, ... after the deadline, with the help of the Government Officials, ... this land will be evacuated off the slum dwellers. By the orders of the Government. Get it signed. Let's go. - Yes sir. A little drop of rain makes a mighty ocean. I request to all the brothers and sisters residing in this colony to ... put in all your savings into this noble cause so that ... they may not be thrown out of this property. Aunt Flora, don't take any tensions. Well brothers, let's begin our task of collecting the money ... right from tomorrow onwards. Aunt Flora, this is from me. Son, where is your ring? Come in. Aunt Flora, all of us had deposited Rs. 50,000 in the bank ... in the fixed deposit. But now to accomplish this noble cause, ... we too would like to give in our share. Listen brothers, by the grace of Mother Mary ... and by your all's cooperation, ... we have manage to collect 1 million rupees. And, we will deposit this amount in the State Treasury so that, ... nobody can throw us out of this colony, right? The cops took away Shankar. Now Siddhu, it's your job to deposit this big an amount. Yes son, you go. God bless you! Go. See you then. - Go carefully son. This fellow doesn't even know what's going to happen to him. Here you go, Mr. Pyaremohan. - Well done Balu Tagda. Now it will be very easy to get the colony evacuated from those settlers. How about a reward in exchange for this job? Why not Balu? Now, you will become my partners in my project of 5 star hotel. Wow sir! That's just great! Let's take her. Pick her up. Hurry up! Let's go boss. John, Mother Mary is angry with me. My life time saving; a whole 1 million rupees by which, ... I could have saved this colony; ... the henchmen of our enemies have robbed us of it. John, now I have become completely helpless. If my Shankar had been there with me at this dire time then, ... he would have definitely helped me. Hanif, did meet Shankar in the police station? No aunt Flora. Brother Shankar is not in the police station. Hope the enemies haven't caused him any injury. Please don't say such a thing Hanif. Shankar! Jagga, please go and bring in the snake. Leave him. Go on and give Shankar your venom. Brother Shankar! Oh great! Mr. Pyaremohan, couldn't find any needy girl even after much search. Therefore my men abducted this girl - Don't do it again. Go and deliver this girl into my bedroom. Is she girl or a woman? - Don't know Mr. Pyaremohan. I haven't even seen her face. You see it for yourself. No! Father! - What? This sounds like Neelam. How can this be possible? Pyaremohan! What are you doing? - Get out from here! Pyaremohan! Pyaremohan, open the door! Who the hell is it? - That's my daughter's voice. Your daughter! - Father... Neelam, my child! - Father, this animal has raped me. Oh great Mr. Pyaremohan. This is how you have repaid me for my loyalty! Even the devil doesn't attack his own kind and you attacked my house! Before you accuse me of anything, how about first telling your girl ... that you were the one who brought her here. Father! Listen Roopchand, I am terribly sorry for what happened. All I can do now is pay you for your daughter's lost honour. Tell me how much you want. This 1 million belongs to the colony people. I wish to return this back to them and thus atone for my sins. Seems that you are joking. - I am not joking. Jagga! Shera! Catch him! Wha... Brother Shankar! And this wound! Hanif, seems he's been bitten by a very deadly snake. Definitely. This is definitely the doings of our enemies. Yes brother. We should immediately take him to a doctor. No. Now, only the greatest doctor of the world ... can save him from the clutches of death.

Shankar, Pyaremohan had looted this 1 million rupees ... from the colony people. I wish to return back this money and atone for my sins. What the... Have you gone blind? Can't you see? Boss, the news that I have brought for you, ... hearing that, you will not only turn blind but dumb and mute too. Out with it quick! What is it? Boss, I did kill Roopchand but before his death, ... he handed over the bag carrying 1 million rupees to Shankar. That mean Shankar is still alive. You fool! Why then did you not kill Shankar? What could I do boss? My revolver failed me at the last moment else, ... I would have certainly wasted him today. What are you doing? Nobody will interfere else, I will kill you all. If you four value your life then better tell me where Shankar is. Why are you asking the whereabouts of your death? Huh! Even if we knew, we wouldn't have told you. By not telling me the whereabouts of Shankar, ... you four have arranged for you death yourselves. Kalu Ragda and Balu Tagda, gun them down like roasted popcorns. My God! What a way to get into a fix! Oh Mother Mary! Shankar! Brother Shankar! Dankeshwar, if you need this bag full of 1 million then first, ... set these four innocent people free. Shankar, do you know that when there is a duel between two enemies ... then, who keeps the conditions? He who is more stronger keeps the conditions. And you can very well see who is more stronger. Shankar, now you too are unarmed and so are these four. And above all that, this 1 million is now with me. Am I crazy to leave you all alive? Kalu and Balu now instead of four, gun down all five of them. Don't you dare, Dankeshwar! Don't fire. Atleast first open the bag and check. Such a big fraud! I say, where is the 1 million? Oh that's great! I cheated you just once and you are all fumed up! And what about you who has been cheating me at each and every step? Which account shall I put that into? Just as you haven't gone crazy, I too haven't lost my mind ... to hand over 1 million rupees to you. I have sent that 1 million to be deposited into the court. Just as soon as the money will be deposited, ... your game too will be over. The game is not over Shankar. It's begun now. The land on which my five-star could not be built; I will build ... a cemetery on it and before that, I will begin with you all. Shut up! Hey Shankar, stop it! You scoundrel, you dared to touch my mother! You... Let go of me! Virendra Singh, you were working for such sleazes! He is hurting your daughter. Pinky, my child. Don't worry. I am coming. Hail be to Lord Shiva! Hail be to Lord Shiva! It's done here. Let's go over there! Let's go. Shankar coolie, you are being arrested.
