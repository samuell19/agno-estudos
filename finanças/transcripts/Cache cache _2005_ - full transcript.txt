PEEKABOO! After you. No one lives here. Not for 32 years. A garden over there. And now... A magnificent old pigeon house, in its original state. Great. Follow me. How can a house like this be up for sale? That's how it goes... People die. No family left to inherit? People are leaving rural areas. After you. The rural exodus is a reality. Excuse me. Have you decided? It's great! Say nothing! We must lower the price. Don't show him we're interested. So? First impression? In general. Silence means the client loves the place. Or not at all. In general. It's looking like home. - It's looking like - Of course. Stop playing around! What's missing? His ladder. Stop playing around! What can I say Kids! Don't lean over the well! Frederic, tell them. Kids, not near the well! It's dangerous. Come and help us. We don't want to help! We're playing with Zazu. Mommy, where's my swimsuit? We'll find it tomorrow. Call your brother.

Arthur, sweetie, won't you fetch the mail? - I'll go. - Thanks. Will Daddy set up the pool? Yes, he will. No, Zazu. That's not for you. Your food is upstairs That's garbage. Frederic? I have to set up the pool. Just the idea of going to work makes me sick. The heart of the problem is I don't like to work. Listen to you! Arthur. Help clear the table. Actually, I just don't like my work. Why do this work if I don't like it? You say that every year. Every July, same thing. Daddy! When can we swim? After you digest lunch. In how much time? The time to digest. SUPER 1000 You'll scare the fish away. You'll scare the fish away. What's going on? Nothing, It's nothing. Mommy! - Come see, Mommy! - What is it? A ghost! What? A ghost! That's no ghost. Then what is it? It's a farm machine. So is that. See? That's a farm machine. What does a farm machine do? Well, it... It was used to cultivate land. A long time ago. Look at that. It's an old one.... An old farmer's hat. It was worn for field work. During the harvests. For protection from the sun. Caroline... What do we get him? Whatever he wants. What does he want? A video game. Again? By the way... Caroline? I forgot what I wanted to say. No, I don't know where your keys are. Oh, yeah. Are you sure? Listen, I'm not that much of a mess. I'm aware of what I do. I'm not crazy. You, be quiet. Zazu, be nice. We're happy. Everything's fine. See you tonight? See you tonight. Right, you're starting today. Need to. Why not go tomorrow? That's life. That's how it goes We can't always have fun. Be brave, honey. Kids! Don't bother them. Come tell your father bye! That's why. Why what? That's why he's here. Yes, for my patients to meet him. He'll take over my practice. Is he a good dentist, at least? Excellent! Does he hurt? Does he really look like he hurts? I mean, really. Certified letter. Must be my new checks. I need you to sign here and here. Do you have a pen? Nice to see people here. The ghost! I'm coming! The ghost is here! I heard you! Don't play near the well! It's dangerous. Why won't you believe us? It's dangerous. Get dressed, both of you! He took my shoe! Who? The ghost. He took my shoe. Go and get dressed. We had a visitor. It was pretty funny. Who are you talking about? The ghost. Ghost? Oh, the ghost. - He showed up again. - Really? He even stole Aurore's shoe. - No way. - Yes. When I was their age, I had one, too. A what? You know, an imaginary friend But he wasn't imaginary to me. I spoke to him gave him a name. He was real. This went on for a long time. The problem was no one else saw him. That didn't stop his existence. On the contrary. Time to get up. Breakfast is ready. Breakfast is served! It's now or never! I'll put it away. I'm warning you Too late. I warned you Where are you going? To play with the ghost. - Did you brush your teeth? - Yes. - And you? - I brushed my teeth. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. The kids are sick. He won't come unless we sleep. But I'm hungry. They didn't eat lunch. There he is! Keep barking like that.. Tomorrow you'll sleep outside. One more time.. Outside. Got that? Got that? I'll work, too. I'll be tired, too. I'll complain, too. I'll scold the dog, too. Thanks, Mommy! Does your ghost know how much time I spend tidying up? Did you tell him? If only he could be more careful. Will you let him know? For me? Thanks, Mommy! Yes... The big farm Next to Clavet... Where the phone lines pass. Malroux! The phone lines pass near your place? The Caron place? The Caron place. It was renovated. Completely. So he's the one who's living at the Caron place? That's him. Who's place? I can't believe that dog! That's not a good idea. I need sleep. I work tomorrow! That's not a good idea. You plan on hitting every note? I'm warning you. Keep it up. Keep it up. Just keep it up.. Who knows what do! - What? - Zazu. What about him? I don't hear him. You woke me to say that? Listen... He stopped barking. Not a sound anymore. Caroline, please. What did you say? We'll find him. It can't be. It can't be! Sorry to keep you waiting so long. I can't seem to find the... You're right. You're lucky I'm the one who's your guinea pig! This is a bad day to start. You'll find him. I hope so. Or else my wife will be in a state. That must be her. It's there. He must be back. - Frederic. - What? - Listen. - To what? Listen. Caroline, that's enough. - Listen. - That's enough. - What? - Have you seen my pipe? Have you seen my dog? Excuse me. I think I can help. Pardon me? I can help. Maybe a hunter shot him. Maybe he went after a female. Or maybe the Caron boy did it - Who? The Caron boy. Don't know him. The Carons, who lived at your place before. Oh yes, the Carons. The Caron boy? But they all died. - So they say. - Pardon me? So they say. There's something don't understand, Monique. Why didn't he get the farm Why didn't he stay there? He was too young. When his parents died, they left so many debts behind. Even if Raymond could have, the bank would have never agreed: Understand? So it was taken from him. So it was taken from him. And then? He was sent away. He was put into a home far away in the Cantal region. No one said a word. Everyone let it happen. And Raymond. He died. He died. Died of a broken heart. - Since his death... - Wait. Since his death, he comes back. To his house. When was all this? Maybe 30 years ago. I shouldn't tell you this. I know you won't believe me. But I saw Raymond - You saw him? - Yes. He's in your house. I'm sure of it. Your dog is with him. Where did you see him? All the time. I see him all the time. Every time I close my eyes. Every time I close my eyes. I see him. Are you OK? You know... One day, you'll have to.. Accept he's gone. I know. Fine. Three of my chickens were once stolen. Then some corn. I knew it was him. - Did you report it? - Not for three chickens. Did you see him? I don't seek him out. No one else saw him? Some see him when fishing. Some see him when hunting. Some say he's a ghost. You know what I think. You know what I think... He lives out in the woods. In a cabin. He lives off the state? Raymond Caron? He wouldn't know what that means. Not even welfare? Kids! Are you coming? Cold. Cold. Cold. Warm... Hot. Hot. Hot, Hot Boiling. That's it. What do we do now? In the toilet? See, it's not so difficult. You keep looking. Be right back. Wait, if you can't find the rest. You shouldn't stop by. Any sign of him? You shouldn't stop by every day. You have to work. He'll give you a sign. Yes, I know. You have to be good to him, Caroline. Be good to him, and he'll be good to you. Don't worry. We're very civilized people. No need to worry. OK? Poor Raymond. Poor Raymond. Yes. Poor Raymond. Poor Raymond. That's for sheep. It doesn't rust. That's for cows. We might need something more intimidating. Like against burglars. Electric? For example. I have to order it Do you need a lot? BEWARE OF DOG DO NOT ENTER I'm going to bed. I know, Frederic. You don't want to see, but strange things are happening. I'm aware of it. I can tell you're... You're very upset. I just want to say that... Putting up signs... That might not be enough. I know. I'll put up fencing on Saturday. You'll feel secure then. Raymond... Raymond... Poor Raymond. Poor Raymond. Poor Raymond. It's OK. I'm here. I thought I left it at home, but this morning... I looked everywhere. Ask the children. You never know. Kids! Kids! Did you play with Daddy's phone? It wasn't them. Listen, Frederic... look around for it. I'll do my best. Kids? Are you there? - What? - Is everything alright? What's wrong? Don't worry. Just don't worry. Listen.. I'm not against Collixum. It can't hurt her. I'm with the doctor! It's not complicated. Your wife just needs rest. Fine. - Take care. - Thank you. - Don't hesitate to call. - Thank you. Also... No more ghost talk. - At least not for a while. - Of course not. Good night. You're not there. You're not there. You're not there. You don't exist. Go away! Please! Go away! Disappear! Leave the living alone! Adaptation: Richard Lormand Subtitling TVS - TITRA FILM
