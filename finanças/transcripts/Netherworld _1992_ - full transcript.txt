[MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN FIRING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: (SINGING) You're the reason why. You're just trying to make me cry. Make me cry. Yeah, make me cry. Cry. I'm sure you can get me off. You're the reasons why. You're just trying-- MAN: You son of a bitch! [PUNCH LANDING] [MAN SHOUTING] MAN: Help me up! MAN: (SINGING} Yeah, make me cry. Cry. Don't-- don't need a 100 reasons. Yeah. Well, I'm sure you got a 100 reasons. You aren't lost, are you? No, ma'am. I came to get some. Some what? You know. Sugar, you can't say it, you can't get any. Jesus. Now come on, darling. It's an easy, one syllable word. Just say it and you'll feel a whole hell of a lot better. I want to get laid. Now see? You half way to getting some already. Isn't that better? Jesus, God Almighty. This your first time? Uh, no, ma'am. Been laid lots. No, I mean this is your first time at Tonk's Place. Yes, ma'am. Please don't call me ma'am, sugar. Makes me feel like your mother or something Yes, ma'am. Oops. Sorry. What should I call you? My name is Mary. Mary Magdalene. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE MOANING] You're gonna just love what I got in store for you. [CLATTERING] What's down there? You're not ready for what's down there yet, sugar. Well, come on in, sweety. She's a special one. So you be real nice to her. Understand? - Yes, ma'am. [PEOPLE MOANING] Time's up, guys. [MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [CLATTERING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [WOMAN CRYING OUT] [MUSIC PLAYING] Want a good time, cowboy? [WOMAN CACKLING] [MAN CACKLING] You're a brave one. What you mean, babe? Sneaking down around here where you're not supposed to be could be dangerous. No, just looking where I can see. Well don't just stand there salivating. Step on in. Maybe you'll get lucky. Do you sing? [MAN LAUGHS] No. DELORES: Maybe I can teach you. Maybe when I'm through with you, you'll be able to warble like my dearies here. Maybe. How much do you have? I've got nothing. I spent it all upstairs. Too bad. I guess you'll have to give me something in trade. I have nothing to trade. You got a soul, don't you? Or did you spend that upstairs too? What you mean, babe? [MUSIC PLAYING] You look like a pretty bird, you do. What you do? DELORES: It's brazier powder. What is? I'm gonna put a love spell on you. No. No spells. Just fucking. DELORES: Oh! Just fucking. [MUSIC PLAYING] I never fucked a little bird before. I never fucked a little bird. You like fucking Barbusoir? You like fucking Barbusoir? Say it. Say, fuck me. Say it, fuck me. Fuck me. [BREATH RATTLING] A witch, huh? That's what, you a witch. [BARBUSOIR GROANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Look what mommy's making for her babies. You're own little man bird to sing for you. [BARBUSOIR SCREAMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] COREY: I suppose there are some journeys in one's life that should never be taken. My passage home after my father's death was one of those journeys. I had never known my father or anything about him. He was an absence in my life. An enigma. A hurt. He was a missing chapter that left me feeling incomplete, unresolved. So I came to this place, this land of mystery and enchantment, to this strange land where death is not the worst thing that can happen to you. I came haunted by a need to learn something, anything, anything about the man who had given me life, and whose death had now brought me to this fascinating world. I came that day to my father's mystical other world, to his kingdom, to his domain, to face a lifetime adventure, filled with the unknown, the unimaginable, the inconceivable. I took a seductive ride on the river that day. Began a journey that would change my life forever. [MUSIC PLAYING] BEAUREGARD: Young man Thornton. - Pardon? BEAUREGARD: Are you the young man, Corey Thornton? Yes, I am. Beauregard Yates, esquire. I've come to fetch you. Thank you. Right this way. Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is my father's estate? No. This is your estate. COREY: Right. [MUSIC PLAYING] And who's that? That's jail bait, Mr. Thornton. Good for 10 to 15 years, with very little chance of parole. Momma's fixed you all up. Isn't that right, honey? Honey. Yes. Nice boy. Wanna go? There you go. Mrs. Palmer, may I present Mr. Thornton. Mr. Thornton, this is Mrs. Palmer. Hello. She was your father's overseer. She runs the place. It's remarkable. You're the very image of your father. The crackling image. Your father was an extraordinary man. Don't disappoint him. So, you were my father's lawyer? Yes. Did you know him well. Yeah. I uh, never knew him. He-- he didn't stick around very long after I was born. What was he like? It's not proper for me to discuss my client. I never could understand how a man could just walk away from his own flesh and blood. Why even have a child if you're just going to walk away? Instructions from your father. - Instructions? - Yes. It's customary for the deceased to leave his last wishes. Right, of course. These are the probate papers. Look them over. If you have any questions, you have my card. Also from your father. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll return in a day or so for the papers. Thank you, Mr. Yates. I can't shake hands. Goodbye, Mr. Yates. BEAUREGARD: Goodbye. [MUSIC PLAYING] COREY (VOICEOVER): Corey, my dear son. A few years ago, I discovered a peculiar coven of souls endowed with uncommon restorative powers. So extraordinary was their power that they could give life back to the dead. Toward the end of my life, I grew determined to develop their power in order to live again. Corey, I am convinced that with your love and support, I will be able to rise up from the grips of death and return to the world of the living. NOAH (VOICEOVER): Sometime in the next few days-- COREY (VOICEOVER): Sometime in the next few days-- NOAH (VOICEOVER): --by a woman named Delores. COREY (VOICEOVER): --you will be visited by a woman named Delores. NOAH (VOICEOVER): She will teach you the necessary steps to effect my resurrection. Son, do not falter in this important effort. Do not fail me. Do not disappoint me. DIANE: Hello. Hello. You're young man Corey Thornton, I assume. Yes, I am. But why does everybody call me young man Corey Thornton? It's just an old Southern salutation. Means you're the new heir. Ah, I see. And who might you be? Well, I might just be trouble for you, young man Corey. I have been known to lust after older man. Especially when they're as cute as you. Much to the embarrassment of my sweet, but hopelessly overprotective mother. You met her. The melancholy madam of Bell Oak Estates. Yes, I met her. So, young man Thornton, you like what you see? Diane. Mother. Dearest mother. I was merely warning young man Thornton of the dangers of his new home. MRS. PALMER: Diane. Please. Please forgive me. I'm misbehaving again. I'm sorry, Mother. After you settle in, I'll take you on a tour of the place. I'd like that. Keep you hands off him, Mother. He's mine. I'll show you to your room now, Mr. Thornton. Thank you. [BIRD CALLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Dinner will be ready at 7:00. Unless of course, you'd prefer another time, Mr. Thornton. No. 7:00 will be fine. Good. I've left you some tafia drink if you get thirsty. Thank you. Mrs. Palmer? Would you mind calling me Corey? I'd rather not, if you don't mind. It doesn't seem proper. Mr. Thornton is a habit of mine. Even if I wanted to, I don't think I could change. Excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] MRS. PALMER: Oh, no. You're not supposed to be in here. Naughty, naughty. COREY (VOICEOVER): It was Delores who first introduced me to the bird people and taught me how to give life back to the dead, and how to store the souls of bad people in the bodies of birds. The first time I witnessed the ritual of souls, Delores revived a woman who had just been killed by a jealous lover. From the curative practice of using the instrument of injury to cure the injury, Delores proceeded to bring the murdered woman back alive. The image of Delores exuding such a gift-- NOAH (VOICEOVER): The image of the exuding such a gift began to consume me, releasing for me a renewed sexual desire. Delores was the most explicitly sexual creature I had ever known. But more than her sexuality, I was drawn to her power. A power I was determined to have myself. For my sexual escapades with Delores, I was imbued with a commission of giving life to the dead. And it was then that I began thinking about how to use this power to restore life to my own body after my death. I became obsessed with making love to Delores, as if by consuming her, devouring her sexually, would somehow fill me with all her extraordinary power. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come with me. [DIANE SCREAMING] Why are you screaming? This is only a dream, right? I mean, Delores-- I'm sorry. Just like his father, a sexual priapic. [BIRD CALLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] DELORES: Help. Help me, Corey. If you wanted to see me without my clothes on, the least you could have done was try to seduce me in the proper fashion. After all, I'm not a child or some silly Southern belle that's been kept all her life in a glass. I, um, I'm sorry. I really am. If I tried to explain it, I don't think you'd believe me. Shouldn't even be speaking to you. Well, I'm glad you are. How else would I get a guided tour if you weren't speaking to me? OK. So, you, uh, you grew up with my father, didn't you? Yes. What was he like? I liked him. I did. I thought he was a good man. But he changed as he grew older. He became more reclusive. Then in the last months of his life, he took up with a local woman from Tonk's Place. What is Tonk's Place? That is Tonk's Place. All the locals pretend it's just a little country brothel, but it's much more than just that. This whole area is just filled with people who practice black magic in one fashion or the other. You know, love potions, revenge spells. Mostly harmless stuff. That Tonk's Place, it's dangerous. It doesn't sound dangerous. Sounds fun. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't ever go there, Corey. Tonk's Place is where your father died. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did I scare you? Come on, Corey. You be that young man Thornton, ain't ya? Yes. Come on, Corey. He's crazy. She be right, boy. I am crazy. [MAN LAUGHING] Crazy old Bijou. [BIJOU LAUGHING] Watch out for crazy old Bijou. He just might take his fishing knife and filet you right up the middle. But then, maybe I won't. [BIJOU LAUGHING] But then, maybe your daddy wanted me to help you. What? Take you over to Tonk's Place so you can help your daddy like he wants you to. You get the hell out of here, you crazy old man. I'll kill you. Child, I lived in these parts all my life. You think I'm gonna let a tiny little drop of spit like you scare me off? I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready. You got spirit. I give you that, little one. Woman with that much spirit, bound to be a good poot. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD CALLING] [BIJOU LAUGHING] [DIANE GASPING] COREY: Diane! Diane! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm scared, Momma. It's all right, baby. I'm not going to let anything hurt you. Get some sleep. COREY: Is she all right? - Yes. Just very upset. Good night. COREY: Mrs. Palmer? MRS. PALMER: Yes? I'm sorry. I know I haven't made much of an impression, but-- On the contrary, Mr. Thornton. You've made quite an impression. Just not a very good one. I don't mind what you do with your life. Really, I don't. I just don't want you to involve my daughter in your troubles. Good night, Mr. Thornton. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: (SINGING) I know love is a word in the dictionary. Words ain't real, they're imaginary. People write songs. People write books. [INAUDIBLE] like a fisherman's hook. I'm a stranger to love. I'm stranger to love. I'm a stranger to love. I'm a stranger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, look what the Devil sucked in. Young man Thornton in the flesh. Well, I was hoping I'd find you here. Well, here I be, my friend. Tell you what, I'll buy the first round of beers. You buy all the rest. What you say to that. I'd say you're a gambling man. What you mean? Gambling I won't leave after the first round. [BIJOU LAUGHING] That's good one. Very good. I like you, boy. What you say, young man Thornton, let's stir up some shit, huh? You want dance with me? Uh, no, thanks. But I'm a good dancer. Come on. I'm sure you are, Bijou. But I'm going to sit this one out. I'll dance with you, Bijou. Fuck off, Nona. I wanna dance with the boy. MAN: Hey, asshole. You want to pick on somebody? Pick on me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now what you say, pretty boy? Dance with me? Look, Bijou, I didn't come here to dance with you. I don't want to make any trouble either. I just came here to talk to you about my father. [BIJOU LAUGHING] I'm making fun with you, boy. Trying to loosen you up, that's all. You don't play. Shit's supposed to happen here. [MUSIC PLAYING] To the old man. May he live again. [MUSIC PLAYING] [FLOOR CREAKING] You silly boy. I told you not to go to that place. [MUSIC PLAYING] MRS. PALMER: Corey Thornton. BIJOU: People didn't like your father. Why not? He owned all the land in these parts. He was rich, powerful. And he was touched by the Devil. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's Delores. Leave her, boy. She's busy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, uh, Delores. I need to talk to you a minute. DELORES: Sorry, darling. I'm busy right now. I'll just take a-- Can't you hear, Mister? She's busy. It's important, OK? How important? Wait inside. Wait inside, baby. I don't know where you're from, boy, but you don't seem to get how things work around here. [GUN COCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD CALLING] Now, you may not believe this, but I like you. I do. And I'm going to be good to you. First of all, I'm going to let you live. Second, I'm going to let you pay me for liking you so much. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't bother thanking me. Now get. Go on. Get. God, I hate being a mean bastard. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN GROANING] [BIRD CALLING] [MAN SCREAMING] [BIRD CALLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] DELORES: Corey. [THUNDER CRASHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] COREY: Ah, good morning. Good morning. Looks like you had a rough night. Oh, yeah. I'm not used to the heat. Here. This'll cool you down. - Thank you. What? - How adventuresome are you? - I don't know. What did you have in mind? [MUSIC PLAYING] DIANE: This is where your father's buried. Spooky, isn't it? Looks just like your father. What is that? I dunno. Just one of those silly thingamajigs. My father wants me to revive him. He wants me to bring him back from the dead, Diane. I need your help. Corey, you have no idea what you are saying. I like you. I would do just about anything for you. Please, do not get me involved in this. People could die. You don't understand. No, you don't understand. You'll die, Corey. Just like your father died. - No. [MRS. PALMER BREATHING RAPIDLY] [HEART BEATING] COREY (VOICEOVER): A strange thing happened today. I saw a little black girl with strange blue eyes down by the river. She was playing all alone with a little toy boat. I'd been watching her for a while when she accidentally fell in. Poor thing couldn't swim and-- NOAH (VOICEOVER): Went under almost immediately. Before I could get to her, she sank and drowned. I pulled her body from the water and I took her to Delores. According to the rights of souls, if you borrow a spirit from the keeper of the birds to give life back to an innocent one, you will be hallowed by the rightness of life. So Delores kissed the little girl and gave her life again. It made me cry. [MRS. PALMER BREATHING RAPIDLY] [HEART BEATING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MRS. PALMER: Please, don't. Please. No, please. I was just trying to save my daughter. No, please. Please, no. No. [BIRD CALLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] COREY: Wait, Delores. MAN: (SINGING) Make me cry. Yeah. Make me cry. Hey. Looking for someone in particular? Yes. I'm looking for Delores. Delores. Well, I think she's occupied at the moment, but how about one of my other ladies? Uh, no. I need to see Delores. Well, sure, sugar. The customer always knows best. If you don't mind waiting awhile. I'll wait. Billy C. Honey, take care of this handsome young man for me. BILLY C: Yes, ma'am. I'll be back, sugar. What'll it be, Monty? Uh, cold beer, please. Cold beer, coming right up. You're staring at me. I'm sorry. It's OK. Everybody does. I don't really mind. You probably think I'm one of those celebrity impersonators, don't you? Well, yeah. I mean, aren't you? You still don't get it, do you? No, I guess I don't. I am Marilyn. First I was alive, and then I was dead. And now I'm alive again. They did it for me. You can do it for your father. Don't disappoint him. OK, she's waiting for you, honey. Who? Delores. Are you all right? She said she was the real Marilyn. Of course she did, sugar. I'm Mary Magdalene. She's Marilyn Monroe. I got a girl who likes to go as Jane Fonda, another one who dresses up as Madonna. Customers like a little fun and theatrics with their fucking. OK, handsome, tell you what you do. The girl's rooms are one floor below. Go down those stairs over there, take the first turn. When you get to the corridor, Delores's room is the third one on the left. She can't wait to see you. - Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] What? ENTITY: Some fucking good show, huh cowboy? ENTITY: What do you say? Want something like that? WOMAN: What are you hiding up here? Oh, cowboy. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] If you get tired of Delores, come pay me a visit. I've got some tricks nobody else in the world knows about. MAN: Marilyn. See ya. [MUSIC PLAYING] You really do have it. Have what? The power my father wrote about. That's right. I have it. The same power I gave your father. Delores, I'm talking about bringing my father back from the dead. Will you teach me that? DELORES: I'll teach you everything I know. Heart, body, and soul. I'll do anything. As long as you teach me what I need to know. I'll teach you. I'll teach you everything. [MUSIC PLAYING] She blinded me. [BIRD CALLING] My god. MRS. PALMER: Diane? Diane? DIANE: Mother? What's wrong? MRS. PALMER: She put a spell on me. I've gone blind What the heck? [MUSIC PLAYING] Diane. I'm taking my mother to the hospital. What's wrong? I don't know. She can't see. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning, Councilor Would you please tell Delores I'm here. Sorry, no one here till dark. Did she leave something for me? - Yes. - Good. We need to get it closer to the boy. Handsome specimen. Very handsome. Thank you. See you next time, Councilor. [MUSIC PLAYING] Like father, like son. [MUSIC PLAYING] Perfect fit, huh Dad? Corey, my dear son. I'm convinced that with your love and support, I will be able to rise from the grips of death and return to the world of the living. Rise, Father. [MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN (IN BIRD): Help me. See what happens when people are bad? DELORES: Corey. Hello there, young man Thornton. Mr. Yates. How are you? Thirsty. Would you like me to fix us some tafia then? - That would be fine. - OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, here we are. There you go. - Thank you. And our attractive Palmer ladies? Where might they be? Diane had to take her mother to the hospital this morning. Hospital? Why? Well, she-- she said her mother couldn't see. Oh, my. Blind? What a thing. What a terrible thing. [MOTOR RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. How is she? She's resting. Mr Yates offered to stay with her. What did the doctor say? They want to leave the bandages on a few more days then they're gonna run some more tests. There appears to be no medical reason whatsoever for her to be blind. What do they think it is? They hope it's psychosomatic. Do you know what I think? I think she's just trying to get my attention. She can't expect to keep me under her wings too much longer. I'm not a little girl anymore. She can't go blind every time I do something that doesn't have her blessing. I want to help you with your father, Corey. Uh, Diane, I've-- I've changed my mind. I, uh, everything that's happened with your mother, I just I-- I don't think it's a good idea. I really don't. I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] I dreamed about you last night. I, uh, dreamed a lot of things about you last night. You want to bring your father back today, don't you? Yes. Am I ready? DELORES: Before your soul can be separated from your body, Corey, you must find the rightness of life and hope you're guided in the proper direction. It's an unpredictable journey that will take you to one side, or the other a strange. Are you ready for that? Yes. DELORES: Good. Now I want you to think about the goodness of your father, about how you wish you it had been. Close your eyes. [WINGS FLUTTERING] Try to tell me what you see on your journey. COREY: There's a small bird heart. And a scared cardinal. DELORES: What else? COREY: There's a figure. I think it's me. DELORES: Good. That means you're in. Now I want you to concentrate on finding your father. Let your dreams of him pull you into the light. [MATCH FLARING] [MUSIC PLAYING] COREY: Why can't I find my father? [DELORES SHUSHING] DELORES: Just keep searching. [HEART BEATING] COREY: It's so weird. [DELORES SHUSHING] Corey, I want you to call for your father. How? DELORES: Call for him. COREY: Father? Father? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, son. I know you wouldn't disappoint me. Father? Don't you recognize me? Something's wrong. You weren't expecting him to look like. No, no, no. It's something else. [MUSIC PLAYING] How about giving your father a nice kiss? [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. Yeah, let's have a look at you. Oh, you're a nice specimen. You're young. Strong, hardy. You turned out very well, Corey. Thank you for doing this for me. Taking my place. It's not right. He didn't tell us it was about switching. [BIRDS FLUTTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] See, if my son, my only flesh and blood takes my place, I'm free to return to the land of the living. No. No! No, Father! Why are you doing this? No! No! Handsome specimen. Very handsome. You should've danced with me, pretty boy. [BIRD CALLING] Why are you doing this to me? You're my own father. Christ died for his daddy. What are you complaining about? Diane? [DIANE BREATHING RASPILY] Corey. Corey, listen to me. You can get out. You know what to do. His father has him. What can I do? - You love him? - Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] See what happens when people are bad? [NOAH SHOUTING] NOAH: Never keep me here! Never! Never! Never! [BIRD SQUAWKING] Good morning, Father. NOAH: Never! [MUSIC PLAYING] What is this tafia shit anyway? I don't know.
