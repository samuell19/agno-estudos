Rolling? -Give a second, just a minute. A second, just a minute. You can only say that in Hebrew. "Give me a second, just a minute." -Great. I don't know where... I need you to help me. -With what? I don't know where to start. It doesn't matter, you can start from the middle. Every writer knows that. Do you wonder when it will happen? Of course. -All the time. It keeps getting delayed. Like... I thought it would happen faster. Really? -Yes. You thought you wouldn't be here today. -Yes. Most people take being alive for granted and death is a complete shock. But that's absurd, because the only certain thing is that we're going to die, no one leaves this world alive. There's no way, right? So the most obvious thing is death and it's a miracle every day that we're alive. Think about all the blood vessels, at any given moment one could get clogged. Think of a car. So what's obvious is not that we wake up healthy every morning. And then you appreciate life more. When you don't take life for granted, every bite, every sip, every... smile of a child, every conversation, it's all... intensified. And even more so since I found out I have cancer. I've never been asked to a meeting with someone who wants to talk about their literary estate while they're still alive. Your reaction was so strange to me. Yes. -Because talking about it is no big deal for me and you reacted as if you'd never heard the word "death" before. Look, I come from... not only my family background, but also, I come from a place where cancer is a word you're not allowed to say. I know people who are sick... When my mother was sick, the word was never mentioned. Really? -Never. The word did something... Before I had cancer, when people asked me how I'd rather die, boom on the street or heart attack in bed. Or to know in advance that you're going to die. Most people prefer the boom. Not me. I always said so. -Yes, I want to prepare for death. And one of the reasons I asked to meet with you is that I want to leave behind a clean, organized desk, including my estate, because writers, much to our delight, 70 years after they die, I can still... send regards to my family. I lost my parents relatively young. My mother died when I was 23 and my father ten years later, both from cancer. From a very young age I was at the top of the pyramid, no one above me. Only when your second parent dies and you become an orphan in stereo you truly comprehend the first parent's death, at least for me it was like that. And then you say, okay, I'm at the front now. How am I going to be? You have to ask yourself what you're going to do with that. Dealing with my parents and my thoughts about how I'm going to take on death. And my decision not to be afraid of it is what the play is about. It happened by chance. My neighbor Eran Baniel, was hired as director of the Khan Theatre. He wanted to bring in new people and asked me to write a play. So someone came and asked you. Yes, and it was very difficult. -Really? Very. It was during the first Gulf War. I remember it being such a nightmare that I hoped a missile would hit the Khan Theatre. so I wouldn't have to do it. What is it? Someone was run over. Oh no, what happened to him? Dead. Good. At least he's out of his misery. -True. Are you a doctor? Far from it. Just passing by? Wrong again. Then who... Never mind, none of my business. Good night. I'm death. What? Death. So skinny? It is what it is. Are you for real? Yep. Why didn't you say so before? If I had known, I wouldn't have been so rude. You have no idea how happy I am to meet you. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Mind if I smoke? On the contrary. -Thanks. I'm not allowed to smoke at home. The kids are killing me for every cigarette. It's all in our heads. We have many fears in life. Fear of flying, fear of spiders... Once you're not afraid of death, it includes everything, there are so many therapists for this fear and that fear, but this includes everything. Because once you decide to live without fearing death, you don't fear anything. Wait a minute, you're not afraid at all? No. Not even a little bit? Absolutely not. Not even a slight tremble in your knees? A small heart fibrillation? Nothing? A fibrillation of happiness, maybe. Happiness? -of course. I've never seen such a reaction. No? No. That's strange. Usually people are afraid of me. Why? I am death! We're starting to repeat ourselves. Why don't you sit down? But you're aware that most people are terrified of death. They really don't want to die. Just the thought, the moment, makes them tremble. There's something screwed-up in this world, everyone dies, all the time, every minute, from stupid things too. Wars, accidents, knives, parking spots, kids falling out of windows. Really, people die all the time. Now, the Buddhist approach that says it's like a leaf falling off a tree, does the tree cry? No. Okay, so new leaves will grow. That's the way it really is. But we think we're so important. I think that part of letting go is giving up some of your ego too. You can't have a huge ego and not be afraid of death, it doesn't go together. So I may be lucky not to have a huge ego. I never did, I was born with a little one. Here are... the negatives and their contact prints, see? Wow. -And here's a print. It's cool to look at it through this. Yes. I want all of these pictures. -Okay. -This one is beautiful. It feels like you're inside the picture when you look through this. There's a difference between not being afraid of death and... remaining here after someone very dear to you died. It doesn't matter that we grew up in a family where we spoke about death and laughed about it. It's the same pain. It didn't reduce the pain. It all began when my parents took me to see Kazablan when I was 14. First play I ever saw. I fell in love with Yehoram Gaon, totally, and in that magical world of theatre, it was as if I'd awakened from a 14-year coma. "Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip-ee-dee-dee, zip, zip, zip, zip "In my hand, in my hand..." It's strange that I thought I could be an actress because... -By nature... I'm one of the shyest people I know. When I see myself, I don't understand who that is standing there and dancing, frolicking like a gazelle. Not like a gazelle, I'm as stiff as a board. At my audition for the army entertainment troupe I finished on my knees, because my legs were shaking so bad. They put me in the back, so no one could see. What was it like being in the Nahal troupe? -Amazing. First of all, I had a boyfriend. -Gidi. So it was great. We were a couple and we had these seats on the troupe's bus that we set up with lighting and a curtain, like business class. So there's the issue of her family who weren't too crazy about me. They wanted a doctor. Classic situation. I was a singer and... She didn't ask for their blessing. And we became a family straight away. When we got married, I think that over the years, we were together for about 40 years, you... Not you. Me. Not you guys. Me. I realized that... I wanted to grow old with her. We'd be this old couple, 80 years old, we'll be so nice and it'll be fun, the kids will come over and everything. Only after my second son was born, I said to myself, okay, another banana, another this and that, I got the picture. Now what? I heard they were looking for writers on "Zehu Ze". I thought I'd give it a try. Zehu Ze, that's it... I gave the head producer a script and she let everyone read it without telling them who wrote it, back then I still wrote by hand, there were no computers. Only after everyone approved it, she told them it was me. And then you started writing for "Zehu Ze". Tempestuously. The human race has ruled the world for many years. Foolish, kindhearted creatures that turned the world into a place where one cannot live in peace. These are Israel's borders, generally speaking. Who can show me our borders? I learned, I learned from them how to write From them? -Absolutely. -How? They'd throw away whatever wasn't good. On Zehu Ze, there was no time for: "Listen, it's good, but no". They'd just toss the pages behind them. "Okay, come up with a new idea, let's think." She passed me, that maniac. No, we passed her in the opposite direction. No one has ever passed me and lived to tell the tale. And then you learn, Zehu Ze was the best writing school ever. I was in that magical world that fascinated me, which isn't reality. These people... Don't worry, Juliette. As it says in the bible, the bad guys always lose. Yeah, but it's not like that in real life, there is no happy ending like in plays. And then I missed the theatre. -Yes. I love the rehearsal process in theater, I don't like when the play starts running. I hate premieres. After the Cameri Theatre got the play they thought at first to do it at their tiny hall. Because it's for girls, you know... So I managed to get into theater, but not in a big way. It was a huge, huge hit. I think it's one of the first plays that saluted feminism. I used to come at around 8:00, the play was at 8:30, just to get a whiff of the scents around the box office, because there were 700 women. It played 700 times and it went down because they couldn't do it anymore and we didn't want to replace them. The three actresses Keren, Sara and... -Anat. -Waxman, yes. Did the magnitude of the success surprise you? -Yes, of course. Success is a surprising thing. Failure is obvious, again. It's a matter of attitude, but... failure sinks in much more than success, right? Why is that? -It's very hard for us to truly experience success. I say to myself, experience it, it's a success, but it's in your head. It doesn't sink in. The question is, what is a good friend? Oh, come on. A good friend is a good friend. It's not mystical, it's scientific. Tirzah isn't a good friend, I am a good friend. Science according to Sophie. If a good friend means being loyal, standing by you at times of need, then it's Sophie. I told you so. But if a good friend is having a good time, rising above reality, then it's Tirzah. There you go! So you suffered with me all those years? I didn't say I suffered, but all we did was talk about your troubles. I truly am sorry that my life is not as dazzling as Tirzah's. Excuse me, I work very hard at making my life "dazzling." I just try very hard not to bother everyone with every problem I have. It's mostly among girls, I don't think it exists among boys. Good friends? We're a totally different race and we don't have... that fuse. I came to the production and everyone's with babies. Edna Mazya and Anat Gov are standing in front of us and we work according to the breastfeeding and the schedules of the kids. And it works. We saw that it's possible to be a huge hit as a total mother. And this insight struck me and I thought, the world needs to change, not me. Suddenly I was only with other women and that was incredibly powerful. Faster? Edna and Anat... She didn't leave home, but... they were two women who stuck to each other, became friends and artists. Edna directed most of her plays. They became one entity, they became one. At first we felt badly for our other friends, so we'd go to Jerusalem so we could be open about it, seriously. That's where the term "friend on the side" came from in "Best Friends." We fell in love, definitely, we fell in love, we spoke the same language. We laughed, that was the main thing, laughing. We'd sell our mother for a joke. Someone called us a two-headed monster. We were like one person. We complement each other, we're not alike. No? -Not at all. Edna is assertive, she knows what she wants, she has good aesthetic taste, which I don't exactly have. There were two times where she insisted and she was right. Then during that part she'd always say: "You see?" I said, "What the heck is that joke?" And she said, "It's really funny." I said, "It's not funny." And the audience roared. I don't see the problem with a blow job now and again. I think it's a waste and I don't like the taste. Army food isn't that tasty either, but we ate it. I quite like the taste. You're nothing to go by. Do you like the taste too? Look, it's not gourmet dining, but I've never been picky about food. I'm an orphan. The audience interrupts me, they're laughing. And Anat gestures to me, wait, wait, wait. But I want to talk. But the audience is laughing. She says, "Wait, wait. Now." Hillary doesn't do it. Hillary doesn't have to. She has others to do the dirty work for her. Her punch lines are so precise, if you change the slightest thing, it doesn't work. Before Tirzah became famous, you were always at my side. From the moment she became famous, there was a rapid, panicky shift towards Tirzah. It's only natural. Everyone wants to be on the winning side. It's not a war, Sophie. Everything's a war. Life is a war. It was like being in a movie. Dead bodies, tanks, and it was all so bizarre. The next day we performed in the Golan Heights for guys who'd lost half their regiment. We didn't comprehend, it was such a shock, you can see on their faces that it's horrifying, and the idea that we could make them laugh or entertain them was bizarre too. No one understood what we were doing. When we started performing in hospitals a bit later on, you suddenly see the insane amount of wounded soldiers. It was really... And you realize that war isn't a song. By sheer coincidence, today is Remembrance Day. You left me a message yesterday, "I'll come after the siren." You called me last night at 7:59, you think I'd answer before the siren? I prepare for the siren like for death. You... It won't catch me off guard. What's there to prepare? I know exactly where I want to stand for the siren. Where did you want to stand yesterday? -In the yard. I like to be outside. I like to see people. There's something about everyone standing, it works like a Swiss clock. No matter how much cynicism there is... As a little girl, I'd cry my eyes out, every year. The national anthem and the siren on Remembrance Day. It still works, I must say. Yes, what works for me is that silence, it's suddenly silent, everyone shifts down a gear. And you feel like you're part of something for just one moment, unfortunately. Because right afterwards it goes back to little crumbs. So perhaps for that moment, at least for me, from my ripe old age I did have that experience as a little girl of one Israel, small and just. There's a longing for that, so that moment preserves that feeling. And the terrible sadness that the wars don't end. And probably never will. It's some kind of instinct. It started after Rabin's assassination. I wasn't sure if I could write an article, it seemed to me like... She used to write out of anger, both plays and publications. And when she was angry she'd write the article in one go. I had an arrangement with Yedioth Daily that I wouldn't write regularly, only when something pissed me off. There was a time when lots of things pissed me off. After Rabin's assassination you felt the need to meet settlers and... I met with settlers, orthodox, Israeli Arabs, Palestinians, I went to checkpoints. Whoever didn't think like me. I had the best time with the orthodox. Really? -Why? They have a good sense of humor. "What does a woman want I'm not sure what But what is for sure is that she wants a little peace and quiet Every woman has her own goddess Where are you, my goddess, do you need me too?" I don't accept the fact that you put us in an immoral place. Not you people. Not us. -All of us. -All of us. -Right. Not me, not the settlers, us. Israeli society. But we're responsible for these women who give birth at the checkpoint. We're both responsible and not responsible. -We're the occupiers. That's not true, there is no occupation anymore. No, no... I can't feel fully happy until our neighbors have independence. And I can't enjoy my freedom if it comes at the expense of the freedom of others. So I hope they get to have their own Independence Day. I'll be very excited when they have their own Independence Day. I may even feel for them what I felt as a child. And then I'll be able to fully celebrate Independence Day. But it doesn't prevent me from seeing all the achievements we've made and how lucky we are to have a state. As long as there are things that can be done and fixed, there's hope. Your situation is worse than ours. I'll tell you why. I go into Israel every day. I have nothing to fear. I just go. But you Israelis are now sitting at home, in fear. You're afraid to get on a bus, to go shopping, to go far away, but I have nothing to fear. What should be done? If all the women from Athens and Sparta unite and declare a sex strike, they'll have to make peace. We just have to close our legs. It's so simple and so brilliant. Anat Gov drew fire. She's Anat Gov, she's Gidi Gov's wife, she's opinionated, she's a journalist, she write articles for newspapers, she speaks on TV, she's in entertainment and theater and writing, she studies Torah, she's not ignorant, she's dangerous. She was attacked because of the Ariel affair, Anat was one of the leaders of the protest not to perform in Ariel. Anat said to me, I'm going with you to the Knesset. Edna said, you're not going. She said, I am going. Anat Gov. I'd like to remove two words from this discussion's lexicon. There is no insubordination, we're not soldiers, there are no orders here. People have the right to tell their manager their opinion. Boycotts are not part of our terminology. There is no boycott, we have nothing against the residents of Ariel. We're talking about crossing the Green Line. Regarding the third and fundamental thing that we signed this document for. An actor can go to a theater manager and say: "I don't want to perform on the Sabbath" which is the day when theaters are full, "because I observe the Sabbath." He wouldn't fire him, he'd respect him. That's not true. -You're wrong. Folks... That is slanderous! That is a populist statement! But can you understand that some people feel the same pain like if you had to desecrate the Sabbath? Just tell me if you accept that. I understand. -Okay. Now the money issue? -Yes. How much money has gone to settlements? -How is that related? It's out of my pocket. The state subsidizes Shas yeshivas and many other things that are not to my liking, but my money still goes there. You're not doing us any favors with the cultural budget. Every country in the world subsidizes culture, culture always rebels against the establishment, shows its wrongdoings, that is its role. Let's just say that when I watch the news, it doesn't make me feel like having chemotherapy. You don't think, wow, it's so great to be living here. Not the world, the world is beautiful, but people are very cruel. So she says, let's take this God who is doing such a good job at killing us, in the name of some... "If you don't observe the Sabbath, you shall die, "if you don't this or that, you'll be stoned." Let's take this guy who you believe created this splendor and let's talk to him. You have violence issues. You got used to solving everything with "a strong hand and an outstretched arm." You don't want people to love you, you want them to fear you. Your blazing wrath, your raging anger! It's like... an abusive man. Like what? -An abusive man. An abusive man? You're always angry, you have outbursts of rage and then punish terribly. And right afterwards you're terribly remorseful. That's the pattern of an abusive man. You're a danger to the public, sir. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life, and my life has been very long. And it's the same with everyone you love, especially the ones you love the most. You love the Jews the most, right? "The Chosen People," hooray for us. How romantic for us. Let's see what we got out of that enthralling love - 400 years of slavery, 40 years in the desert without a decent bathroom, a tiny period of happiness until you lost your temper again and sent us into 2,000 years of exile in places where we were treated to pogroms, inquisitions and Treblinkas. That's love! Not any ordinary love, it's a covenant, right? A covenant! We cut a bit off our sons' dicks for you and what do we get in return? We get screwed! Are you nuts, talking to God? But she really did talk to God when she was little. I thought it was so funny. I said to her, what for? Who are you talking to? She read God's biography, she was interested in this entity and used to talk about him a lot. And I always refused to listen. I said to her, he's not our friend, we're not his. And it's her most successful play worldwide. Do you believe in God, Anat? Not the one that religious Jews believe in, not the one who sees what we're doing. and asks us to tear toilet paper ahead of time for the Sabbath. I believe that we should be good people. Good people. -Yes. There was definitely a completely private Anat who wasn't mine or anyone else's. She was hers. And whatever I don't know, I don't know. I don't want to know, it's hers, it's her. They really look alike here. It's interesting that you didn't have to work hard to bring out this intimacy, because it really was there, there's no pretending here. How are you feeling? -All right. All right? I'm not really all right, but when you're near me I forget everything. We need to talk. What about? About your death. What's there to talk about? Were you writing about me, Anat? Did you have me in mind when you were writing to these characters? She took "Househusband" from her own life, after Gidi... She got home one day and found the kitchen... as if someone had been slaughtered with red on the ceiling, filthy. She called me and said, "Gidi made ketchup." I said, instead of getting mad, write a play, it's a great scene. Making ketchup at home is like making hummus at home, only much worse. It's completely idiotic, but... that's what I was. I don't do those things anymore. Turns out you need 30 kilos of tomatoes just for one bottle. You do something with them, then pour vinegar into it and... I don't know what, puree it. The kitchen was all red and filthy, but I made ketchup. It was just a one-time thing, but Anat saw it and was appalled. What happened here? Writing always helps me, because it breaks down the... Instead of letting it out negatively, it comes out positive. I got back from Costa Rica so happy. I sat there on the balcony with the parrots and the animals... We had to do that medical exam, so we did. What's it called? Gidi and I went together for a colonoscopy, very romantic. I went in first. When the doctor woke me up, he said, I want you to come in to see me tomorrow morning. So I said to him, why, do I have cancer? Just like that? -Just like that. And he said, yes, but you won't remember me telling you. I said, you think I won't remember something like that? Then I said, I'll come alone, don't say anything... Why alone? I wanted to feel free to ask the most difficult questions without feeling sorry for anyone. And then he spoke with me, I was very cool and I told him I didn't want to do anything. Of course, I was completely hysterical. I remember saying to her, we have to go to couple's therapy. So there's a psychologist and you say to him, oh my god, etc. She was very cool about it. She said, make me laugh. There's something almost abnormal about that, someone tells you this thing and you're totally cool. Not only that, when I left the clinic... -Yes? I stood outside and thanked God. You did? Yes, that my kids are grown up. Okay. That it happened to me and not someone else in my family. He said I'd have to have a big operation and chemotherapy, and it turned out... at the second appointment it was clear that it had metastasized. What they call stage 4. There is not stage 5 in cancer, so... And you don't feel anything either. So perhaps if ten years earlier... She should've gone, obviously. Every doctor I saw said, how can you be so stupid when you have a history and it's hereditary? Because if it's detected early, it's like you never had it. So if you had gone ten years ago... Even five or three. But those are the facts of life too. It's the same one who didn't go get tested. It was the only time she broke down, right at the beginning. She cried. And that's it, it was over. You just live with it. The Angel of Death is here. Everyone's going along with me. If I don't make a fuss about it, then there's no fuss, life goes on. We go to treatments, he drives me there and back. Do you talk about it a lot? -Of course. We talk about afterwards. I talk about it too much, they're sick of it. Right, right, yes, yes, you talk about it very freely. I can look at women on the street and say they'd be right for him. Oh my goodness gracious. That's what it was like. "I can't believe you're saying that!" Because it's unbelievable. She's looking at girls. Not girls. Women. -Women, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Anat. -We're talking about old people here. I'm sorry ,Anat. Although you never know. -You never know. -You never know. I highly recommend him, he's a great guy. But you never know anything. Now that I think about it, knock on wood, I don't dare to ask you... what... What don't you dare to ask me? How could you not dare? Because not everyone's like you, darling. -It's no big deal to me. But it is to me! That's the difference between us. No, I'm saying that this could be a situation... that is completely irrelevant. What do you mean? That perhaps... -I won't die? Yes. -I'll die someday. But it could be in 20 years, which you don't believe. -Let's just say it would be a medical miracle. The statistics are five years. Okay? 10 percent get through the first five years, I was never in the top ten percentile in any class, in any situation, in anything. So I don't think so, but yes, there are medications, so another year or two. It's megalomaniac to think 20 years. After the last test I did, which came out well, I said to myself, my next play will be about a woman who prepared for death and then doesn't die. -I wish! I wish. -And then she starts complaining. Because once you're in that state of mind there's something disappointing about continuing to live. You know. At the end of the day, life is 95 percent errands. Yes. -Right? I'm listening. 95 percent. And five percent? Five percent pleasure. Five percent pleasure? Think about your daily routine and you'll see. This broke, that needs fixing, you need a plumber, you have to pay the bills and do this and that for the kids and go to school and talk to the teacher. -Is writing also an errand? -No. It's not. Writing is the meaning of life. It's the greatest gift. -Yes? -Absolutely. Aside from my family and kids. -Of course. I need a tiny bit of Jewish mother-ness from you, Anat. You are a Jewish mother after all. My most important creations are my children. No doubt. This is my family. Or rather, it was my family up to two years, three months and four and a half days ago. How time flies when you're dead. Of course they were sad when I kicked off, but they got over it. Did they stop eating? Of course not! I like when the kids come over on Fridays. Tradition is tradition. I won't be at the Seder this year. I can't hear you. I'm not coming to the Seder this year. What do you mean? -I mean I'm not coming to the Seder this year. I don't understand what you're saying. What's to understand? I'm not coming to the Seder this year. You won't be with us on Seder Night? Where will you be? -I'm going away. You're going away? -To Finland. On Seder Night? The day before. Mom! What Mom? I have a right to know why you're abandoning me on Seder Night. There was no question about it, since I was born, we did every Seder at my grandmother's. That's it. When Gidi's mother came to the play she said to Anat afterwards, "It's incredible, there are people like that woman, I know some!" My mother used to say, "What if Grandma dies?" Now, my mother wasn't a typical Jewish mother but on this issue... My grandmother really was old and could've died. But she didn't. And who will sit where? And then it turned into one hell of a story. I don't want to go to the Seder, okay? I don't want to. I'm an adult and I'm not interested. The whole Seder thing, this Israeli-Jewish coercion, this madness, this craziness got a very nice play out of her. Life has turned into writing material. Ultimately. The family, everyone, paid... the price. -Yes. -I say that jokingly. -Of course. And it gives you a different perspective on life. Even when something bad happens, like cancer, I'll try to turn it into something good with writing. I said to her, why the hell not write a play? What do you care? You're not afraid, all those things that are built up inside your soul, and that come without any fear... Now it's just a certain strength inside of you. So she said, nah, I'm not interested. What for? I said, then what's the point? Then you're just sick, without... turning it into something. I always told her, "Turn the defect into an effect." I have a deadline. I love working with a deadline. Really, it's... Even them putting it in the theater's brochure is actually... -Obligating. -Exactly. In my case the deadline really is a deadline. When a doctor tells you, there's nothing more we can do... So there's another good year left, it's okay. I don't understand why we're talking about death. Can you say that again? I don't understand why we're talking about death. Top floor, outpatient oncology center. Why don't you try. Give it a chance. Maybe you'll hold up better than you think? At least try. If it's bad for you, don't come for the next treatment. No. If I start, there'll be no end to it. Humans are adaptable, greedy creatures. Of course I'll hold up and discover amazing strengths I never knew existed. What are you so afraid of losing? Human semblance. Did you think at first not to have any treatments? Of course, and surgery... -You didn't want that. No way. But I did it all, like a good girl. The operation was defined as a massacre by those who were present. Because they took out many parts of your body. At the time, did you want it to be over already? There were moments at the hospital, yes, when I wanted a pillow over my face. So it would end. And the kids having to come every day... It's exactly what I swore I never wanted. But when the doctor told me, you have kids, you have a family, and your consideration isn't just... -Yes, yes. I said to him, I've always put myself last, perhaps death is the right moment to listen to myself and do what I want. He said, no, you still have an obligation. I got the family together and told them I was doing it only if no one gets depressed, we take it all in good humor, they all carry on with their lives, no drama and no oy-oy-oy. When she started her first chemo treatment, which she really didn't want to do, but the family pressured her, Gidi and I went with her to the hospital for the first time and the lovely nurse, Bruria, who Anat loved very much, walked into the room and read us the list of medication that Anat would have to take. And I could see how she was turning it into a scene. No sugar, no salt, no coffee, no meat No chicken, no milk, no butter, nothing fried Nothing cooked, nothing spicy, nothing tasty We'll let it drip slowly-slowly One hour or two You might experience some dizziness or a hangover So don't try standing up on your own On your own Tingling in your toes is just a side effect If you feel nauseous at home, you've got some Pramin here For severe nausea, take Zofran Zofran... You're not coming to see a tragedy, it's a musical. The only problem is Zofran has side effects too Really bad headaches! As long as I live in peace with it, as long as I'm functioning. Not needy, not dependent. That I refuse to be. Let's elaborate. I don't want to be dependent, to be cared for. One time I was in the hospital after surgery for three months. I got the picture, I don't want to be there again. You don't. -No. -I see. Listen, I was a rock and roll chick. Not everyone can say that. A rock and roll chick can't die like this, with a bald head, right? There's something I don't get here, your wish, which you express more in the play, of someone who didn't want to undergo treatment. But it's not that she doesn't want to undergo treatment because she wants to die. Nothing here is a result of her wanting to die. She wants to die right. She wants to die right, just as she lived. I want a happy ending. You think if you refuse treatment you'll have a happy ending? If I can die right, then yes, that would be a happy ending for me. And what's "to die right"? Dying is an art just like any other. Knowing when to exit the stage, leaving a taste for more. That's to die right. To enjoy the months I have left, say my goodbyes to everyone, maybe I'll even have time to fall in love. Some people prefer short-term relationships. I want to meet death when I'm at my best, not full of holes, cut up. I want to know when to let go. That's a good death. "To die without slowly killing those who will remember. " Wow, what a monologue. Nothing gets through to you. What kind of doctor are you? You're all damaged goods. Gets through to me? Gets through to you! This isn't a play, this is your life! And of course I cry. I cried at all of Anat's plays. You get this blow of emotions, you suddenly say... I think that whoever receives this gift of knowing you're going to die, you can do something with it. There's a reason for it. And it is possible to have a happy ending. In the sense of a good death. There's a good death and a bad death. Even in death, there is that option. And a good death is when everything's organized, nothing's left unsolved, you said your goodbyes, no missed opportunities, no regret. That's a good death. Don't you get mad sometimes? Not at all. Not at all? -I never said to myself, "Why do I deserve this?" Yes, yes, yes. No one deserves this. There were people who said, "You don't deserve this." Who does? Who does? As if the world works that way, those who deserve it get it and those who don't, don't. I keep thinking, where's the bug? Where's the catch? -What is she hiding? She's hiding something from herself. And maybe that's healthy. Maybe... How could she not be angry? What should I be angry? I had a wonderful life. Why not keep going if it's so wonderful? -Because that's being greedy, there's no end to it. There's no end to what you want. I'm thankful. I had a wonderful life, to this day. I had a wonderful life. What else do I need? What more could one ask for? More? It's endless. Okay, I could've lived another 30 years. But okay, that's not gonna happen. We could've gone to Broadway to see your new play coming out. That could be wonderful. It doesn't matter in the end. Really. What matters is if you feel good about what you've done up until that moment. It's great having a granddaughter and being there when she was born. I wouldn't give up those experiences, in retrospect. But there's no end to things we want to do. I want to see her at her Bat Mitzvah, at her wedding, why not have a great-granddaughter? It's... We discussed earlier how hard it is when someone loses a child, it's really... That's a horrific topic. No optimism there. Yes. That's why I say, it'll be much harder for those around me. Or even now. Because I won't know. With regards to the death of Tamar, Anat's granddaughter, I was ambivalent, as if it matters what I was. On one hand I thought, thank God Anat isn't alive. On the other hand, they really needed her. But as her friend, I said to myself, she was spared... We know that Tamar died and we talk to her and write to her, she just had her birthday, her Bat Mitzvah, two weeks ago. And death, especially the death of a child... From that moment on, unless you're... some super-Indian sadhu who doesn't eat and can stand on one toe for a month, then... That's how we've started off. At least for now, these initial years. Something dies inside of you. No doubt about it. My biggest fear in life before something worse happened to me was to lose my mother. There are many gifts in growing up with my mom and dad, who they were, but... the dark humor definitely helps to deal with very tough situations in life. I do have a feeling of "coming home", that in death, you're somehow "coming home". What does that mean? I can't tell you. What do you think happens after death? Look, there are two options. One, that we'll reveal the big secret. I relate to death like an adventure. And I'm truly aspiring to experience it. When it happens I don't want to vanish into a state of panic, but rather go through this journey, something must happen at that moment. The question is, what happens afterwards. So there are two options. One is that... you discover the secret of life, I don't know what happens there. And the other option is that you don't. You just go to sleep. Neither seem like the end of the world. It was so strange. My children and I go looking for a grave for Anat while she's still alive. She's alive, yes? And we're touring cemeteries, saying, what about here? No, it's not nice here. Now they're burying them in those holes in the wall. Not that. We show her pictures. "What do you think?" We wrote her obituary with her. She wanted them to write: "Anat Gov quit smoking." Me and Gidi refused. I said, come on, there's a limit. But I put a cigarette on her grave. I hope there's no reincarnation, I don't want to start all over again. Who knows, I could be born in Sudan or some other country with a civil war going on or where girls have to wear burqas. Ultimately, what's left is what people remember of you. Living another year or two doesn't matter, from a historical perspective, it's insignificant. What's significant is what people remember of you. This is your last chance to change your mind. No thanks. -Are you sure? Surer than I've ever been in my entire life. Ready? -And able. Move your shirt a little. It's stopped I don't know how to thank you. Have a fun life! That meeting with her was so significant in my life. She said to me, Arik, you're going to die and you need to know that. And in the subtext, what she was saying to me, or maybe it was in the text, it's not so you'll love death or want to die, but to remember that, so you won't be afraid to live your life and make your dreams come true. Thanks to her, I'm a father today. It's the greatest gift I've ever given to myself. Like every Saturday morning, I made her toast with avocado, she loved that. Edna came over, they spoke for a half hour, said goodbye. A doctor comes, a medical team. She couldn't stand when people said "passed away." Died. Died. I'll tell you something she wrote to me. She wrote, "Don't hurry. Keep going, work, have fun, "have grandkids, but when it's your time to leave, come along, "I'll take you for a walk on the Milky Way." So death is something that's not so... It's a shame to die, it's really not good, it's best to feel well. But... to start taking vitamins and all that stuff? Double masks, not going here and there and... I think that through Anat, we all know that worst case scenario you die. That's it. On this happy note... -Exactly. On this very, very happy note, is that how you'd like people to come out of your new play? Your next play? From my life. -From your life. Of course. When it's sad outside again And autumn is close to heart - without you And I want you but you're so far away I don't want to be alone right now I call out to you, but you don't answer You left, you went away Because without you, this whole city is empty And its streets are barren At a moment of longing At a moment of silence I'll call you Come back to town now, to me...
