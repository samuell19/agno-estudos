Authorities worldwide expressed shock at these allegations. Most daring thefts of modern times. Fowl is said to be hiding ancient relics worth hundreds of millions of... Time and again, these museums were robbed of untold riches. Some say the true amount stolen may never be known. Where I am amidst what can only be described as a media frenzy. He couldn't dismiss the fact that when he was arrested... The collection contains the rarest evidence of ancient worlds. Most expressed horror at his alleged criminal activity, while others hinted at a more widespread conspiracy. Many similarities to numerous daring thefts shrouded in mystery. A crowd has gathered... It's him! It's him! Breaking news. There is the car. Yes, the car has come down. And it looks like young Artemis Fowl is here. Authorities have now made connections to one man. Artemis Fowl. Breaking news now and a suspected accomplice of Artemis Fowl is today arrested near Fowl Manor. Help me. Is this unidentified individual a link to Artemis Fowl and the multiple thefts? We have reports that British intelligence authorities are expected to question the subject immediately. Is it true? Do you have anything to say, Artemis? How does it feel to have a criminal for a father, Artemis? Your name? Mulch Diggums. Exactly what were you doing near Fowl Manor? So now it's illegal to go for a hike? This was no hike. Unless you tell us exactly what happened at Fowl Manor, you will be permanently imprisoned. Wait, wait, wait. You don't want me. No. No, I'm just a talented tunneler. You want the brains of the operation. The one who stole the Aculos. What, precisely, is the Aculos? The Aculos. A weapon so powerful and mysterious, it can barely be imagined. You're lying. Look, I know you don't believe my story, but I can prove it. Mr. Diggums, I highly doubt that. You will see. All I see is that there was some highly unusual seismic activity around Fowl Manor and reports from a crazed fisherman of fairies. Well, maybe the fisherman saw something he wasn't meant to. It's fantasy. What's reality is that you are a common thief who is somehow in league with a quite uncommon thief. We want to know everything about the man you work for. The man? No. This isn't about the father. This is about the son. The son? Do not underestimate the kid. Let me show you the infinite possibilities of magic. Let me tell you the story of Artemis Fowl. A story that begins where every great story begins, in a place where magic and wonder still exist. The most magical place on Earth. Ireland. Home of Artemis Fowl. Artemis loved Ireland. The sea and the land. Not so much the school. You see, he just didn't need it. When he was seven, he beat European chess champion Evan Rashoggi in five moves. When he was nine, he won the architectural competition to design the Dublin Opera House. When he was ten, he cloned a goat and named it Bruce. Weird choice, but he's an unusual kid. Good. And you know when you're that unusual, you're going to stick out. Well, Artemis, let's talk, shall we? Certainly, sir. I can see you're admiring my chair. It's a family heirloom. Grandfather acquired it from Sotheby's. William and Mary period, 1689 to 1702, as I'm sure you know. Impressive. Once in use at the palace, Buckingham Palace. Queen's favorite chair, apparently. Now, Artemis, there is a problem. The problem is that I know the textbook reply to any question you may choose to ask. The problem is that you don't respect anyone enough to treat them as an equal. That's ridiculous. I hold several people in the very highest esteem. Really? Who, for example? Albert Einstein. His theories were usually correct. How about someone you actually know? You seem to have all the answers, Doctor. Why don't you tell me? Well, where shall we start? That's my biography, I presume? It is. It explains quite a lot. Such as? Well, firstly, there's your dear mother, of course. Who was a wonderful woman, in my opinion, and taken from us far too soon, but who sadly had absolutely no control over your behavior. Then, of course, there's your father and his mysterious absences from home. This is a sensitive area, Doctor. But do you think that's why you are as you are? No. And by the way, I didn't know they allowed fakes at the palace. - Fake? - It's clever, I'll give you that. But look at these furniture tacks. Crisscross pattern on the head. Machine-tooled. Makes it 1890s at the earliest. Your grandfather was duped. Artemis, you're lashing out at me, but I think I know what this is really about. Is it because of the burden of your father's name? No. It's because I'm forced to endure this ridiculous therapy. Artemis? Look! Just who do you think you are? But, of course, Artemis wasn't on his own, even if it may have seemed that way sometimes. For if there was one thing Artemis liked more than his own company, it was being at home with his dad. Artemis Fowl, Sr., a dealer of antiques and rarities and just about every Irish fairy tale you might care to imagine. They're trained in the art of... Except that you didn't have to imagine, for Artemis Sr. Taught Artemis Jr. Everything there was to know about the leprechauns and the banshees and the sprites and the goblins. So much so that you might even have thought that Artemis Sr. believed in the legends of the little people. He certainly shared his passion with his son on the rare occasions when he wasn't away from home. But while he was there, he was absolutely determined to have Artemis know all that could be known about the fairies. To prepare the boy for a day that would come much sooner than anyone expected. Did I ever tell you how all those fairy stones got to come to Fowl Manor? Thousands of years ago, this is where the peace was made. After the war between the human world and the Tuatha De Danaan, a human and a fairy met... Just tell me when you're leaving. The helicopter's being prepared for me right now, son. I'm sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. That's what you said the last time, and the time before. I know, Arty. There's just one very important thing I have to do. And I know it's been hard, but, look, my work is coming to an end. And like the stories, you know, they all have an ending that just... Well, it makes you smile. And this one will be no different. And when it ends, a new story will begin. And maybe, just maybe, it'll be yours. I'm not a kid anymore, Dad. Well, you used to believe in magic. You believed in the goblins, and you believed in the trolls. You believed in everything I told you about the Hill of Tara. All I really want is to believe in you. Okay. Come here, son. I love you, son. More than you could ever know. Then take me with you. You're all I have now, Arty. Let me keep you safe for a little longer. Come on. And remember, until I see you again, may the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. May the rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may a friend be always near. Good night, son. Good night, Dad. What are you talking about? Yes, he took off yesterday, as planned. What do you mean, he never arrived? The boat was empty. Have you checked the manifest? How long before the media have it? I don't know. You'd better make some inquiries. Domovoi Butler. Friend, mentor, bodyguard. Ten years of martial arts training in Kyoto, seven years of weapons training in Moscow, six years of strength training at Gold's Gym in Venice, California. And under no circumstances were you to ever call him "The Butler" even though his last name was in fact "Butler." You could call him "Dom," or "Domovoi," or "Very large man in a suit," but call him "The Butler," and he'd snap you in half. Not always sunny, though. There will be some cloud that'll bring a few drizzles now and again, especially along the western and northern coast. Now back to our main story. Authorities today launched a worldwide manhunt for Artemis Fowl. A reclusive businessman, but now a controversial public figure whose superyacht, the Owl Star, was found abandoned last night in the South China seas. Fowl is a known collector and antiquities dealer, but in dramatic new revelations, he is also suspected to have been behind some of the biggest robberies of the past 10 years, including the disappearance of the priceless Rosetta Stone from the British Museum, the irreplaceable 14th century Boru's harp, and the iconic Book of Kells from Trinity College, Dublin. No sign of struggle was found aboard the Owl Star and her owner's fate is entirely unknown. Investigations are ongoing, but until further news of his whereabouts can be established, doubts will remain. My dad. - Artemis. - Where is he, Dom? We don't know. I have people on the way to the wreck as we speak. And the remaining question... Artemis Fowl, antiquities dealer or criminal mastermind? How dare they! He's not a criminal! He's my dad! He's my dad! Dad! Artemis, don't answer the phone! - Artemis! - Dad! Hello? Dad? Hello? Artemis Jr., I presume. I have your father. What? Who is this? Is this a hoax? If you have my father, I want proof. Then you shall have some. Dad? Dad? Artemis. Artemis. You listen to me, son, you stay out of this. Okay? Do you hear me? There's no way you can help me. It's too big. Everything I've told you is true. It's all true! Your father stole something from me and hid it. My enemies have prevented me from retrieving it myself. You will do so on my behalf. Find the Aculos, or you will never see him again. Artemis! What's the Aculos? You're a clever boy. You'll work it out. You have three days. Artemis, what did they say? Word for word. Whoever it was... - Man? Woman? - I couldn't tell. But they were asking for something called the Aculos. What is it? Artemis, get dressed and come with me. You weren't supposed to see this yet. Your father would kill me if he knew we were here. I'm showing you because I have no choice. What is all this? This is where your father kept his entire life's work. And his father, and his father before him. It's not what it looks like, Artemis. Everything in this room was acquired for a specific reason. Sometimes to protect its secrets, sometimes to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. These are relics from another world. I don't understand. I was never meant to share the details of your family business. These relics have been passed down through the generations. They're secrets that your father had intended to share with you when the time was right. But the fairies are a myth. None of this is actually true. Look around you, Arty. Maybe those stories can help us find him. But where to begin? I don't see anything about an Aculos, do you? No. I helped him catalogue much of this, but he never mentioned such a thing. And he always shared his discoveries with me. The only thing he kept private was his journal. Then that's what we have to find. I wouldn't know where to begin to look. Could your father have ever given you a clue as to where to start? He never told me how to start, but he may have told me how to end. - End? - Yeah. He read the same poem to me every night before bed and every time he left. "May the road rise up to meet you. "May the wind be always at your back. "May the sun shine warm upon your face." "May the rains fall soft upon your fields." Who wrote this poem, Arty? Nobody knows. That's just it. Then how do you find it? It's known as "The Irish Blessing." It's a journal. It's Dad's journal. Go to the last entry. "She's hunting me now and would kill me to find it. "She knows the truth of "what Beechwood gave me before he died. "They know we have the Aculos." The voice on the phone told you to find it. "The Aculos cannot fall into the wrong hands. "It had to be protected, "even from the fairies themselves. "Time to believe." Time to believe in fairies? But they're not real. Are they? But as Artemis would soon find out, they are very real and they've been living right under your feet for 1,000 years. And their cities at the center of the Earth are not something out of a storybook. No. They are just as real as you. Diverse and strange and beautiful. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the wondrous, thriving metropolis that is Haven City, home of the fairies. You have now arrived at Haven City Central, this transporter's terminus. Please make sure you take all your belongings with you before leaving the transporter. Officer Holly Short, two minutes to security briefing. Do it with Koboi. Shuttles to the surface... We bring you a community leader... Our main story this morning. As a second week passes, there is still no sign of the Aculos. Fears are rising. However, authorities assure us the crisis will be swiftly handled. Even so, doubts are mounting. Yeah. Thank you. See, this is my favorite part. Mainly because I'm in it. Keep an eye out, brothers. We dwarves gotta watch each other's backs, am I right? Lay low, I'll get us out of here. You're not a dwarf. - No, I am, I'm a dwarf. - No, you're not. I am a giant dwarf. You've got a big mouth for a dwarf. You won't talk so much at Howler's Peak. That's where we goblins do the talking. And what we say goes. Next! Hi there, gents. Mulch Diggums. Two G's in Diggums. Tunneling and entering. Repeat offender. 400 years. Yeah, that sounds about right. Hey, hey, hey. Knock it off. Knock it off. Knock it off! Next! Move! Officer Short. Good to see you. What are you in for this time, Mulch? Tunneling and entering. Put in a good word for me, will you? You know I'm an artist. Yeah. A con artist. Art is art. Great artists are never understood. Hey, you and I would make a great team, you know? Me cracking safes, tunneling into banks, you watching my back with your tiny but effective fairy weapons. That's your plan? Less of a plan, more of a lifestyle choice. By the way, this your wallet? Stop picking my pockets! Think of my children, Holly. - You don't have children. - Not yet. Prisoner for processing. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, don't go yet. We're the same, you know? Your last name is Short. My whole body is short. You're not short. I keep telling you that. That's just discriminatory. I'll write it off as ignorance because I love you! And thanks for the music. Move it now. I am very much a dwarf. Over here! Briar Cudgeon. Is this about my appeal? Yes, you will be a commander again. All charges dropped. I've convinced the executors to grant a pardon after your court-martial. Commander Root was powerless to stop it. Who are you? My fairy godmother? Yes, only now you work for me. The Fowl boy is in play, and I want nothing that prevents him from bringing me the Aculos. You will infiltrate Fairy Command on my behalf. I spy? You spy or you die. Morning, Shorty. LEPRECON! Commander! What are all these rumors about the Aculos? Knock it off! You've seen the news. The Aculos is still missing. Kelp, Verbil, B Squad, C Squad, you're all on triple night duty downtown. The delicate balance of peace in our world now hangs by a narrow thread. Until the Aculos is safely returned, our entire civilization is at risk from the humans or from enemies amongst our own kind. There is a dark force at work, and it will stop at nothing until it has the Aculos. So keep your eyes peeled. See it and report it. We must recover the Aculos and protect our anonymity. For the peace to remain, so must our secret existence. Preserve that at all costs. Jeopardize it, and I'll have you incarcerated at Howler's Peak. Any questions? No? Good. Get to work. Commander Root! Yes, what is it? Commander, I have a new lead on my father. He was at the Hill of Tara. - You're not going. - But, Commander... That's an order. Not a request. Yes, Commander. A word of advice. You're 84, you're young, you have your whole life ahead of you. You'll have plenty of missions to fly, Holly. And you can be a good officer. Just don't make this personal. Let them take care of the Aculos. With Artemis Sr. gone... Let's go with backup. Domovoi knew the stakes couldn't be higher. He knew he would need to bring in some reinforcements. Someone he could trust to watch his back to help protect Fowl Manor. There was only one person he knew who fully understood tactical reconnaissance, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and the complicated mind of a 12-year-old. Another 12-year-old. His niece, Juliet Butler. No links found. Artemis. The searching's important, but you can't forget the basics. - Eat. - There's no time. You've done 12 hours straight. It appears to be nowhere in this house - and yet it has to be. - Zero matches. You're not giving up, are you? Of course not. But I think I may know the problem. I'm not the one to find it. So, how do we summon this mysterious finder of Aculoses? The fairies, of course. They'll help us. Will they? With a bit of persuasion. And do you know where they are? In my father's journal, he wrote of a fairy who would periodically visit the oak tree on the Hill of Tara. She's our best option, because their world, it's too well hidden. And their books, it's not just a different language, it's encoded. Of course it's encoded. By this guy. Foaly. Fairy tech genius and centaur. Foaly! Do not ask him for a ride. Hello, Holly. I learned that the hard way. Commander. What is it, Foaly? We have a problem. One of ours is unaccounted for on the surface. Elf? Dwarf? Goblin? Hard to tell. But it's big. Could be a deep-tunnel breakout. Perhaps through a fault or dormant volcano. Send someone up to identify it. All active duty officers are downtown searching for the Aculos. - Officer Short. - Yes, Commander. - I'm sending you up there. - Yes, Commander. Identify, report, - but do not engage. - Yes, Commander. - Clear? - Crystal. - Go, go! - Thank you, Commander. Commander. Two minutes until Lava Launch. Authorized personnel only on the launch site. This is the quickest way we can take you to the surface so pay attention. You'll be sitting on 200,000 tons of molten lava and traveling at over 600 miles an hour, so don't get out until I give the all-clear. Otherwise, it's... Goodbye, Holly. Rest in pieces. No need to sound so excited about it. What can I say? I just love science. Um, Foaly? Boy. Lava Launch in 30 seconds and counting. Stay shielded once you're up there. - Total invisibility. - Yes, Commander. Magma flare in 12, 11... The last thing we need is a fairy sighting on top of everything else. Hello, Commander. This is not the time. We have an unidentified runner on the surface. Hold on to your breakfast, Holly! This is gonna be a bumpy ride! Is this the best we can do? Send in the daughter of Beechwood Short, the traitor? You're not fit to say his name. Beechwood Short used his magic to steal the Aculos from us, which, need I remind you, is the most precious artifact in our civilization. The Aculos was stolen on your watch. He has put our entire people in danger and disappeared. In my book, that's a traitor. Get out, Cudgeon, before I throw you out. The executors are watching you, Root. And I am their eyes and ears. And I see everything. Carry on. Ejecting you now. Come on! Yes! Artemis, I'm in position. Domovoi, anything to report from the Hill of Tara? - Yes. I'm freezing. - Understood. Now, the oak tree's where Dad saw that fairy, and for my plan to work, we need her. And what exactly is your plan? Keep watching. Trust me. Copy that. Head east towards Martina Franca. Officer Short, your orders are to contain that thing until Memory Wipe arrives. Is that understood? Yes, Commander. Approaching Martina Franca. Runner located. It's a full-sized troll! Pick on someone your own size! I want a Time Freeze around that thing before anyone gets eaten. Are you sure, Commander? We'll need authorization from the executors. I'll take full responsibility. Go! Time Freeze capsule released! Do not use magic on that human. Do you read me? She's hurt. Come on. Come on! Go! Now! Time Freeze loading. Set focus for interior paralysis only. Leave these people alone! Fire. Retrieval. Get that thing back where it belongs and mind-wipe all those humans who think they've seen a fairy or a troll. L.E.P., begin withdrawal. Good work, Officer Short. Now get yourself home immediately. Yes, Commander. That's an order. Mind wipe complete. Prepare to release Time Freeze. Um, Commander Root, it looks like Holly may be taking a slight detour. Officer Short. Where are you going? To clear my father's name! I'll have her badge for this. That's a bit harsh, isn't it? Shut up, Foaly, or I'll have yours, too. These are dangerous times. I've lost a friend and soon, Artemis will begin to know the rumors about me and the thefts. Is he ready for the truth? That a darkness threatens both the human and the fairy worlds? When Beechwood came to me, I knew there was no choice. The Aculos was being targeted. In the wrong hands, it would mean access to the greatest spells in fairy lore. One could teleport armies, wipe out life. The wrong hands are now very close. They belong to a brilliant fairy. Perhaps the greatest of them all. But gone to the bad. Name, Opal Koboi. You are now approaching the sacred Hill of Tara. Coordinates 1-8-3-8-7. Officer Short! Return immediate... Communication disabled. Wow. Dom. The fairies. They're real. Everything my father said was true. Reload. Quick! Quick! Fire! We got one. Holly Short just dropped off the grid. I've lost sound and visual. I warned her not to disobey me. We can't rule out an interception. Give me her last coordinates. She just arrived on the Hill of Tara in Ireland. I checked the maps. The only human habitation anywhere near it is... Fowl Manor. You know it? Alert all personnel. I'm launching a full-scale recovery. - All personnel, Commander? - Land, sea, and air. There's a fairy unaccounted for in the real world. If the humans see it, we'll lose everything. Dear me, Root. Are you losing your touch? Errant trolls? Abducted fairies? Whatever next? If the executors find out about this, you'll be finished. Get the four-leaf clover out of here. Not happy! And what if you look one in the eye? Don't. They're trained in arts like telekinesis, hypnosis, and mesmerism. Correct. So? Defensive options? Humans should wear reflective glasses in order to escape mind control. Good. What is unique about dwarves? Besides digging, they're master thieves and pickpockets. And why? They're obsessed with treasure and can't resist searching for it. Where am I? I'm impressed. You speak English. Speak English? Of course I speak English. I thought you might be hungry. Look, I don't know what fairies eat, but I thought maybe salad? Yeah, whatever. I bet you have beautiful eyes. I wish I could see them. That's not going to work. We've got protection. Who are you? What do you want from me? You're part of the plan. - Who's in charge here? - I am. You're just a child. Welcome to Fowl Manor, Officer Short. - How do you know my name? - It's on your helmet. But it's in Gnomish. Correct. I've read all about you. You've what? I'm here to officially invite you into my home. Invite me? You just shot me! You must now do whatever I demand. You'll have to keep me here forever. If that's what you want. You'll never get away with this. My people will come for me. That's what I hoped you'd say. This isn't over. You expect us to believe he did something this dangerous? He captured a living fairy. What do you think? Try to imagine if humans suddenly found out there was a world of magical creatures living beneath them. Most human beings are afraid of gluten. How do you think they'd handle goblins? Artemis wanted the Aculos to save his father's life. And at last, his master plan was starting to fall into place. He had his first piece. Bait. But now, a storm was coming his way. And the fate of both of our worlds was in the hands of young Artemis Fowl. Artemis. Dom. It's like the whole world is ending. The fairies are doing it. They're creating a Time Freeze. I beg your pardon? It's a kind of temporal vacuum that they create so they can operate unseen by the human eye. I read about it in Dad's journal. It's formidable. Einstein and Hawking were right. Time is bending all over. Anything could happen now. Anything's possible. And while it holds, the perfect conditions for an attack. Exactly. We just picked up your friends arriving. Can't wait to meet them. You won't even see them. Whatever you're planning will fail. Fairies do not negotiate. You can't win! We'll see about that. Sweet. Incredible. En garde! You are so dead. The pair of you. Foaly, I need that Time Freeze now. Exterior only. I need the inside to be alive. I have to talk to that kid. Receiver dishes in position, check. Time Freeze successful! Top of the mornin'. They're coming for her. Artemis, do you really think this is going to work? Who knows? I'm going to need the suit. Send in the advance team. Yes, Commander. Capture only. We need the humans unharmed. We scare them. We do not kill them. I want them alive. Scared, Artemis? A little bit. But I prefer scared to dead, if possible. I agree. If possible. - What are they doing? - Unarmed? Against all of us? Take the shot! Stop them! They have Officer Short's weapon. Behind you, Dom! No! Shoot the Time Freeze capsule! Take the shot! He's destabilized the Time Freeze. How long do we have? I can try to patch it, but it's not going to hold! This is serious. Whatever you're going to do, you need to do it fast. Send in someone to negotiate. You have five minutes. No. Well, it appears your clever little son has kidnapped a fairy. He has your flair for the dramatic. Why are you doing this? Why? It's very simple. Revenge. Not only did your people wage war on mine, considered yourself superior in every way, mocked us, reviled us, dismissed us as the little people, but as soon as we were gone, you reduced us further to silly stories. To have people laugh at us, or to frighten the children. You can't win. You underestimate your people and mine. Fairies and humans are incapable of friendship. Incapable of coexistence. With the Aculos, I will rise to the surface then release my army to take over the Earth and own both worlds and systematically wipe out all of mankind. Then, I will restore fairies to their rightful place as humanity crumbles beneath us. Some said I was mad. They wouldn't listen to me. Guess what? They're listening now. My name is Commander Root. I invite you into my house. Nice try. I'm here to negotiate. Who's in charge here? I am. You're only ten years old. Twelve. How old are you? If you must know, I'm going to be 803 in May. What's your name? Artemis Fowl. So, that explains it. You Fowls have been giving us trouble for centuries. Where's your thieving father these days? I wouldn't worry about that. Now, listen carefully, Artemis Fowl. Unless you release Officer Short immediately, I'll destroy this house and everyone in it. And I will expose your existence to the world. You can't. You're in a Time Freeze. You can't get out. But only for another 27 minutes. Commander, here are my terms. Bring me the Aculos, and Officer Short goes free. I beg your pardon? You heard me. The Aculos. In one of those pots. From under a rainbow, I presume. I warn you, we do not pay ransoms. We never have, and we never will. You might just want to reconsider that. I'll give you 15 minutes. And in case you're thinking of storming the house, no fairies are allowed to enter it while I'm alive. As you say. While you're alive. Who is this child? I think he said he was Artemis Fowl, Jr. Shut up, Foaly. Can't anyone ask a rhetorical question around here? But he's going to find out we don't even have the Aculos and we can't storm the house. That's fairy rules. He never said anything about dwarves. Remember what I said about not underestimating the kid? Well, here's exactly why. The next piece of his plan was set in motion. Knowing the fairies couldn't enter Fowl Manor, he forced their hand and set the stage for the entrance of the true hero of our tale. Well, if you ask me, that is. Get me Mulch Diggums. The kid's plan was fiendishly clever. He just had to get me in the house because he knew the truth about dwarves. We can't resist treasure, which is what brought me back to this cozy little jail cell. See, this was my third time in Howler's Peak, the worst prison in Haven City. My first time in, I did 164 years. But this time, I came with music, courtesy of Officer Holly Short. 1984, Foreigner! It's a real classic. You know, if you like human music. You seem like more of a glam kind of guy. What are you looking at, dwarf? Your eyes. Just wondering what thoughts lie behind those two impenetrable windows. So, you like eating dirt. Well, I don't know if "like" is the right term. Tunneling is kinda something I have to do. It's an occupational hazard. Just don't stand behind you while you're doing it, right? So, this just got awkward. Are you laughin' at me, dwarf? At you? No. I was just following their social cues. Because I'm not laughing. Yeah, I can tell. Wow. Guards. They're really understaffed here. Hi. Do you like fire, too? No. Not so much. That's... So you know, no dwarf really likes fire. Careful, careful. We could all go up in flames. Not us. Our skin is completely fireproof. That's right, isn't it? Forgot about that. Your skin may be fireproof, but what about your brain? Mulch Diggums! Commander Root wants to see you. Exceptional timing. Goodbye, gentlemen. So, I just spoke to your boss. I think she got the message. How are you expecting this to end? With me getting what I want. Which is what, exactly? My father's safe return. This has nothing to do with your father. Look at you with that grin. Thinking you're outsmarting everyone in your little suit and sunglasses. You're enjoying all this. You think it's a game. Game? My father was kidnapped. My father is dead. Can I trust you? You'll have to. You have no choice. How did he die? It was on the Hill of Tara. He was ambushed by one of our kind because he'd stolen something called the Aculos. I've read in my father's journals about the Aculos. About a fairy who swore to protect it. A fairy named Beechwood. Beechwood Short was my father. He knew how dangerous the Aculos can be. It can open portals between worlds. A skeleton key for the whole universe. He hid it. And for that, some say that he was a criminal. That's what they say about my dad. But you know it's not true. That hurt! Artemis, it looks like we've got another visitor. Commander, Time Freeze integrity down to 60%. Understood. Hold it together, Foaly. Mulch. This is a one-time offer. Fifty years off your sentence if you'll dig your way into Fowl Manor and bring out Officer Short. Commander Root, do you mind if I call you... I actually don't know your first name. Let me guess. Britney. I'm way off, aren't I? It appears to me like you've got a big problem on your hands. But? Has anyone ever told you you're like David Bowie if David Bowie were a fairy? So, essentially, you're David Bowie. Do you think the humans will ever find out he was one of us? Anyway, 50 years off my sentence just isn't gonna cut it here. I know what you want. I can't give you that. Come on, Root. Please. I just... I just want to be small. I just want to be normal, like the rest of my kind. To be accepted. You fairies got magic coming out of your ears. What have I got? Three, four feet I don't need. Look, a giant dwarf is exactly what I need right now. What I need right now. A big, fast, hungry tunneler who'll dig their way into that house. It's your choice. Either bring out Officer Short or get back to jail. Listen to the two of us grunting at each other like a pair of hippos with a throat infection. A criminal? A criminal. That's what you think I am? I am so much more than a criminal. Um, technically, most of what I do is criminal activity, but I'm also an artist. You're picking my pocket. Okay. A hundred years off my sentence and a single cell with no goblins. Single cell and 55 years. - Seventy-five. - Sixty. - Seventy-four. - Done. Officers! You reading me, Mulch? Loud and clear, horsey. Dwarfus Giaganticus. Dwarfus Giaganticus. Everybody, stand back. It's feeding time. I'm in. I know that sound. Mulch Diggums. Mulch, I'm switching your iris-cam to X-ray. That's good. You do you, Foaly. You might feel a slight pinch. - You son of a... - Sorry! What would your parents be? We have a visitor. What is it? It's in the portrait gallery. It's like a really, really big dwarf. Yes. Right on schedule. Well, if I was gonna be manipulated, might as well be by the best. And make no mistake, the kid is the best. House marks the spot. What have we here? The TXTL 5000. He's discovered a safe. Let him open it. That's exactly what I want. We meet again. So, they've sent in a dwarf. Look, I need your help. Listen, if I let you out, will you promise not to take command of my brain? I want nothing to do with that brain. And... Bingo! Temperamental. You've evolved. But so have I. Sounds like you're not the only one opening locks. By the way, if you run, I will expose your existence to the world. You are my guest. I invited you in. The rules are clear. They are, but you think you can trust me? Now you can trust me. Fair enough. Let's find that dwarf. Eight new motion-sensitive tumblers. You devil. It can't be. Holy moly! Step back, Mr. Diggums. It's real. It's perfect. The Aculos. The most powerful treasure in the fairy world. Don't. It will kill you if you use it. If any human does. I don't need to use it. Because my bargaining position just got a whole lot stronger. The fairies outside mustn't get to hear that we have this. I'm sorry, human, but they already know. There's been a development? They found the Aculos. As I expected. In Fowl Manor. You know what to do. It's risky. Root has our entire army at her disposal. It's quite simple, Cudgeon. If you wish to survive and thrive in my brave new world, then you will intervene now. Commander! This Time Freeze is seriously unstable. This may not hold. We've lost one! Commander Root, you are hereby officially relieved of your command on authorization of the executors. You're making a mistake, Cudgeon. My only mistake was not doing this a long time ago. With the Aculos in play, the game has changed. Time for a little direct action, don't you think? Let me show you how it's done. Knock it off! Mistake. I mean, really, big mistake. This should wrap things up. Recognize our new recruit? We fed it a little potion of nettles and wasp juice. Everything trolls are allergic to. It's made it twice as strong and 10 times as mad. D'arvit! That can't be good. Go! Come on, let's go! Come on! Gods alive. What is that? A creature that consumes humans in 2.97 seconds and fairies in less than one. Get ready. This is going all the way. I'll need my gun. Jam all magic in the house. But Officer Short, she'll need hers to survive. Her father used his magic against us. I'm not making the same mistake twice. Do as I say. I didn't read much on trolls. Anything I should look out for? The teeth. Good to know. All magic in the house is now jammed. Everything okay? Sure. Help! I'm stuck! Get me out! I'll distract him! Help! I'm stuck! Mulch, help. Juliet, look out! It's okay, I've got this! Juliet, run! Run, Juliet! Run! Come and get some, you big meanie! Help! Quick! Quick! I'm reaching! Gotcha! Artemis! No! No! Mulch! I could use a little help! Good. Hi! Okay. Let me just put this away. Artemis, run! I'll see you guys on the balcony! Juliet! Jump! Holly! Dom! Holly! Holly! Holly! Dom! Let go! D'arvit! Artemis! Jump! Help! I'm trying! I'm trying! Juliet, run! Dom! Pull! Holly, look out! I'll get the gun! Artemis! Dom! No! My. Go! Get help! Try the phones again! Now! Domovoi? Dom? The Time Freeze is collapsing. I can't hold it any longer. There goes another fairy! Help him! I can't. They've blocked my magic. Artemis, there's nothing I can do for him. Hold on, buddy. In kendo, we call it kiri oroshi. - "The fatal blow." - No. You did great back there. Really. All the Butlers will be proud of you. Goodbye, my friend. May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. May the rains fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may a friend be always near. No sign of further activity in the house. Five more minutes, then we're going in. Request permission to restore Officer Short's magic, sir. Permission denied. It could save her life! She's a traitor, just like her father. No, she's one of us! Commander Root. I didn't make you captain for nothing. Don't you dare! Squad! Unblock magic! Come on! Artemis, look out! Come on. Come on, Domovoi! You're back! Holly brought you back! I didn't cry, did I? Little bit. The Time Freeze is gonna collapse any second now. All L.E.P. personnel, evacuate. Mulch! The Aculos. Do you still have it? Yeah, sure. Right there. Good. I have a plan. That's it. Temporal convergence at maximum force. Time bend start now. Distortion, elastication, and space grabs coming your way. For your own sakes, get out of there now and get home safe. This Time Freeze is gonna blow! Officer Short! Get out of there now. Leave the humans. Save yourself! Artemis, what's happening? Take cover! Whoa! Watch out! Come on, we've got to get out of here! We gotta get out... See you on the other side! Mulch, get out of here! Everybody! Take cover! Whoa! Holly, this is your last chance. You can't save him. Just get out of there now. And now, the final piece of the plan. The Time Freeze is ended. They're gone. Did we win? Not yet. I can't give this to Opal Koboi. It's too powerful. Then what are you waiting for? Use its magic to get your father back. - I can't. Not yet. - I don't understand. This holds a power no human can access. It's their source of magic, as important to them as the sun is to us. You have to try. I thought I could, but I can't. Holly said if any human uses it, they'll die. We're running out of time. Artemis, it's too dangerous. Exactly. It's useless in my hands. But not in mine. You're late. You know I'm breaking every rule in the book. You like to break rules. You can talk. Let's make a trade. The Aculos for my father. How do I know I can trust you? My father used to say, "A friend's eye is a good mirror." Are we friends, Artemis Fowl? We are. Forever friends. We need to hurry. Your time is up. The young genius Artemis Fowl has failed his beloved father. Say hello to Beechwood for me. I don't even know that this will work. You have to try. Carry me always. Carry me well. I am thy teacher of herb and spell. I am thy link to power arcane. Forget me, and thy magic shall wane. Die, Fowl! To power arcane. Forget me, and thy magic shall wane. Carry me well. Carry me well. Forget me, magic shall wane. Carry me well. Did it work? Did you bring him back? I don't know. He can't be. Please. Dad! Dad! Artemis... I'm so sorry. It's over. I've lost him, haven't I? Artemis! Did you hear that? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Artemis. No! How? How did you save me, son? I just followed the story. With a little help from a friend. Dad, meet Officer Holly Short, daughter of Beechwood Short. Your father was a great man and a dear friend. He brought me the Aculos because there are forces in your world who wanted its power for themselves. So, he was trying to protect it? Yes. Yes, yes. He was. And he did. With his life. Your father was a hero, Holly. Just like you. He, gave me this list. It's a list of names that I can't even pronounce. These are Opal's accomplices. We were looking for them when I was captured. They're the ones you'll want to investigate. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you very much. - It's so good to see you. - I am not going to cry. I'm not going to cry. The Aculos is safe at last, now that we know our enemies, thanks to you, Holly. Quite the day. Yes, Commander. Curb that maverick streak in you and you'll make a decent officer someday. Thank you, Commander. This place needs fairies like you. Our world has never been so much in danger. It's not perfect, Holly. But it's ours, it's a light to guide us, and it's worth fighting for. I want you to investigate every name on your father's list. Me? Well, who else am I talking to? Nobody else, Commander, just me. - Go on. - I'm going to... You won't regret... I will not... - Go on. - I'll just go. Here we go, Dad. - Nice work, Holly! - Well done, Holly! All right, team, here we go. This is a community still coming to terms with these stunning revelations. The family has lived in the house for generations and is well-known locally, but there's a sense of real shock here that Artemis Fowl, who neighbors describe as quiet and... It would appear we've garnered quite a bit of interest. Not ideal. The media? I have someone working on that right now. I expected you would. These are for you, son. Just don't forget to wash it before you bring it back, okay? Where are we going? To finish this. You think I'm ready? I know you're ready. First, I have a call to make. You failed, Opal. You were wrong about my father. About Beechwood. About everything. And now... we're coming for you. You think you can beat me? You have no idea the world that you have just entered, boy. Just who do you think you are? I'm Artemis Fowl... and I'm a criminal mastermind. What an extraordinary ending to your remarkable fairy tale. But let's get back to the thief, shall we? He will be brought to justice, and you will not leave here until you assist us. You really don't believe any of it? The only thing in that fanciful tale I did believe is that you can be bought. So, let us offer you a deal. Help us apprehend Artemis Fowl, Sr., and then you'll walk. Tsk. Or perhaps I offer you a deal? I walk out on my own, and you leave the Fowls alone forever. And why would we ever do that? So that you can all sleep at night, knowing that the fairy tales you tell your kids remain beautiful dreams, and not living nightmares. And the next time you see the Fowls, be sure to thank them for protecting us all. They keep the peace. Don't ever forget it. That's why Artemis set up my arrest. That's why I'm here. He figured you'd have to believe me. Alert the guards. I hope you don't get squeamish. Lockdown! Immediate lockdown. A tracking device. Designed by the kid. Clap your hands if you believe in fairies. That's my ride! Lockdown! Get back here, you filthy little dwarf! Dwarfus Giaganticus! Don't mind me, I got this. Are you ready to get back to work? I thought you'd never ask. We have some unfinished business. I love my job! Okay. Let's go.
