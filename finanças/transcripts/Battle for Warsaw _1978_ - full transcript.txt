(dramatic piano music) - [Narrator] Poland's capital, Warsaw, the largest city on the road between Berlin and Moscow. And there's the snag for the people who live there. (bright piano music) In the 30 or so years since the end of the Second World War, the Polish capital has been almost entirely rebuilt, much of it in exactly the style as before. (bright piano music) Seeing Warsaw today, it's not easy to imagine what the Polish capital looked like in 1945. (soft ominous music) (somber violin music) 90% of Warsaw lay in ruins, most of it destroyed by the Germans in the weeks before they were driven out of it, destroyed in retaliation for the citizens of Warsaw having risen against the Germans in a vain attempt to liberate their city for themselves before the Russians came. The Warsaw uprising of autumn 1944 is one of the great and controversial epics of human history, a compound of glory and despair, of unparalleled individual gallantry, and of wretched political trickery. (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) Few people remember now that the Second World War began in Warsaw, a city then of a million and a quarter souls. (gentle music) (traffic rumbling) A civilized city, a beautiful city, a great city. A city where Copernicus had lived and Madame Curie, and of course, Chopin. (bright piano music) It was Britain going to Poland's aid when Hitler attacked her in September 1939 that widened a local squabble into a global struggle. But Britain's gesture had not prevented German bombs raining down on Poland's capital. (explosions booming) Hitler had needed just 30 days to bring his Eastern neighbor to her knees and for the German Stukas to make way in Warsaw's streets for strutting soldiers. (rhythmic marching drum music) (upbeat marching band music) The Pols were used to conquerors. In their history, they've tasted freedom only seldom, squeezed have they so often been between the giants of Germany and Russia. But equally, the Pols do not take too gladly to conquerors. Even as Hitler was heiling his goosestepping troops in Poland's capital, a Polish resistance to him was forming. Representatives of Poland's main political parties met that very day in the strong room of the Polish savings bank in Warsaw to set up a resistance movement. The communists, of course, did not take part. Many choose to forget now that when the Second World War began, Russia sided with Hitler in carving up Poland. After more than a century of their subjugation, the Pols had said goodbye to the czars in 1919. Just 20 years later in September 1939, they had to witness a new generation of Russians, this time Stalin's Bolsheviks petitioning their country. Within a week of Warsaw's surrender, a Polish government in exile had been set up in Paris under General Sikorski. (stately orchestral music) When France fell in May 1940, it was to move to London and Sikorski and his colleagues were to be courted by the British as Polish pilots played a prominent part in the Battle of Britain. But after Hitler attacked Russia in June 1941, the London Pols found themselves less and less privy to Allied thinking as first Roosevelt, when the United States entered the war, and then Churchill himself sought to befriend the Soviets. Many Pols had of course been imprisoned by the Russians in September 1939. Now, under an agreement Sikorski signed with Stalin in Moscow in early 1942, some were freed and encouraged to take up arms again, against the Germans. But suspicions were aroused at the smallness of their numbers, despite the enthusiasm of the newsreel commentators of the day. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Newsreel Narrator] The premier of Soviet Russian, in spite of his 62 years, is a virile and shrewd statesman. A sincere and good-natured atmosphere pervades the Moscow council chamber, which augers well for the future. - [Narrator] The future of those Pols missing in Russian hands had been extremely short-lived. (birds chirping) Here, in woods near the village of Katyn about 12 miles west of Smolensk, the Germans in April 1943 discovered the decaying corpses of some 4,500 Polish officers. They had been buried without coffins in mass graves. All had been shot, most of them in the back of the head. Stalin claimed it was the work of the Nazis, but the medical evidence pointed to their having been murdered three years before when the area was under Russian rule. When the London Pols demanded an inquiry by the International Red Cross, Moscow refused to have anything more to do with them. And even Churchill, though he tried, failed to restore the shaky friendship. Hitler's propagandists made the most of Katyan to drive and drive a wedge between the Soviets and their Western allies, not that Hitler's own treatment of the Pols was any better. The nation that had given so much to Western civilization had become simply a source of slave labor for Hitler's Reich. (prisoners chattering) To the Nazis, the Pols were less than human. Jews, Gypsies, and Pols was a well-worn phrase in Nazi pronouncements. Said the Gauleiter appointed by Hitler to rule in Warsaw, "If I were to have one poster hung for every seven Pols "who have been liquidated, all the forests of Poland "could not supply enough paper." Poland at that time was one of the most densely forested countries in Europe. At the beginning of the war, one in three of Warsaw's population was Jewish. Confined at first to a ghetto in the heart of the capital, the Jews of Warsaw, along with other Polish Jews, were in time herded off to extermination camps at Auschwitz and Treblinka on Polish soil. In the spring of 1943, the remaining inhabitants of Warsaw's Jewish ghetto, barely 70,000 of them then out of the 400,000 three years before, rose up in a desperate, hopeless struggle against their Nazi oppressors. Those few who survived that final Holocaust, were eventually exterminated elsewhere. While the ghetto itself, amounting to a 20th of the land space of Warsaw, was leveled by Hitler's henchmen. (explosion booms) (building materials rumbling) But even as the Warsaw ghetto was being destroyed, the tide of war was swinging against the Germans, particularly on the Eastern Front following their great defeat at Stalingrad. By early 1944, the Russians had cleared the Germans from Soviet soil and had crossed into Poland. The Polish government in London wrote to Stalin asking that he respect Polish rights, not knowing that Churchill and Roosevelt had already agreed with Stalin that Russia should keep that part of Poland granted her by Hitler in September 1939. Humoring the Russians had become more important than honoring pledges. What was more alarming for the London Pols as the Soviets neared Warsaw, instead of welcoming the Polish resistance fighters who came into the open to greet them, the Russians were disarming and imprisoning them, and in some cases, even shooting them in cold blood. When the Polish city of Lublin was recaptured on July the 24th, 1944, Stalin set up there a rival Polish government to the London one, a communist government, of course. Time was clearly running out for the non-communist London Pols. As the Germans set about sabotaging the Soviet lines of communication, the London Pols saw that an effort was needed that would stir the conscience of the world. Two years previously, the bulk of the Polish resistance inside Poland, numbering some 350,000 men, had been organized into a secret so-called Home Army supplied from Britain. The London Pols had the idea of using this army to liberate Poland, or at least to free Warsaw, when the time came. Plans for an uprising in Warsaw had been made as early as February 1943. (explosions booming) By mid-July 1944, the Russians having cleared the Germans from their zone of Poland, looked poised to take Warsaw. On July the 23rd, the routed German 9th Army streamed through Warsaw blowing up strategic installations as they went. (explosions booming) Within the capital, the Gestapo began burning their files. German civilians had already left, including the German governor and the German mayor. By the last week of July, only a garrison of some 2,000 German soldiers remained. To the Pols of Warsaw, their liberation seemed at hand. - You needed only to go out in one of the east-west arteries of Warsaw to see the Germans' troops in full retreat. We also seen a lot of lorries taking the furniture and belongings to the German officials who were evacuating Warsaw. And just, I believe, two days before the uprising started, even the Gestapo left. - Plenty of German soldiers was passing from east to the west in very bad shape. They used peasant cart and very poor horse and was lying wounded. Sometimes soldiers was without their shoes. - You could see tanks and German army going west and there was a great anxiety among Germans and nobody had any doubts, you see. We were sure the Germans were escaping and we were sure that the front, the Russian Front, you see, was approaching. We had cannons as a matter of fact, you know, from the east from time to time. (explosions booming) - [Narrator] On July the 27th, the Russians reached the Vistula River 65 miles south of Warsaw, and the next day, pushed to within 10 miles of the city. On July the 29th, the Russians broadcast in Polish to Warsaw, "The hour of action has arrived." The next day, posters appeared all over Warsaw, signed by the commander of the so-called Communist People's Army in Poland, claiming that the leaders of the Home Army had fled the capital. (gun firing) That was the last straw. "Poland Fight" signs were daubed around the city. The leaders of the Home Army had decided to revolt. (group singing in foreign language) After the long years of waiting, life at that moment was exhilarating for the Pols of Warsaw. - [Survivor] We were absolutely elated because for the first time we could move freely, talk freely. We were free of the German Gestapo who were always hanging over our heads during the German occupation. First days, everybody was happy, enthusiastic. Plenty of the Polish flag on the houses. Everybody was singing, laughing, and really expecting that now is end of Germany. And everybody was suspecting one or two days that Russia must close Vistula. - At the very beginning of the uprising, the mood was of elation, and some foreboding as well. We stood quite a lot from Germans, but we were driven to absolute limit. We just couldn't stand it any longer, and we thought to ourselves that enough is enough. - [Narrator] An elaborate network of anti-tank barricades was now set up throughout the city, made up mostly of the inevitable paving stones. A front emerged which separated whole districts of the capital and even individual houses or floors within the same building. (guns firing) The start had been chaotic. After four years preparing for it, many Warsaw Pols were given only a few hours' notice of the uprising. Some of the Home Army units found themselves in a different part of the city from that allotted to them and without their weapons. Surprise should have been paramount, but alas, had not been achieved. The German garrison commander had known the timing of the uprising before most of the participants. At the start of the uprising, the Warsaw Pols had some 38,000 soldiers, 4,000 of them women, but only one in 15 of them, 2,500 all told, had suitable weapons. The rest, until they could capture some from the Germans, had to make do with sticks and swords and antique hunting guns. They faced a German garrison that during the last few days had risen to over 13,000 men, all well-equipped with heavy guns and tanks and airplanes at their disposal. (airplanes rumbling) The Pols, of course, had no tanks and no heavy guns and no airplanes. (guns firing) The first day didn't go at all well for the Warsaw Pols. They obtained none of their major objectives and suffered 2,000 casualties, nearly a sixth of their effective force, whereas the Germans lost a mere 500 men. Ominously, few prisoners were taken on either side. The stage was being set for a macabre dance of death. (guns firing) In that crucial opening 24 hours, the Pols managed to capture only a fraction of the city. The Germans still controlled all the bridges over the Vistula, the electricity works, the railway stations, the airports, even the telephone exchange. With the phones denied them, and having only primitive signals equipment, the Pols had to rely on a bevy of brave girls as couriers, many of whom were to lose their lives. When they did get their radio to work, they call London asking for food and weapons to be flown in straight away, for the Russians to launch an immediate offensive, and for the Polish Paratroop Brigade to be dropped in one of the city's parks. Even if that had been physically possible, the brigade was in fact earmarked for another exploit closer to British hearts: Arnhem. (guns firing) But on the second day, the Warsaw Pols did have some success. (explosions booming) They captured both the power station and the main post office. After five years of occupation, seeing German prisoners cowering before them, boosted Polish morale greatly. They'd also secured a stock of German uniforms, which to add to the general confusion, they proceeded to wear, though with armbands in the Polish colors of red and white. London had replied that since Warsaw was so distant from any major British or American airbase, supplies could not be flown in straight away. Such airdrops needed careful planning, which would take time. Meanwhile, Warsaw would have to hold out as best it could. For the moment, too, the German garrison seemed content merely to contain the Pols. No counteroffensive was begun to dislodge them. Though when news of the uprising reached Hitler, he ordered that the Warsaw Pols be wiped out and their city razed to the ground as an example to the rest of occupied Europe. Heinrich Himmler, his SS chief, was given the task, but all this was unknown to the Warsaw defenders as they enjoyed a respite in the warm August sunshine. Equally unknown to them, days before the uprising began, Hitler had decided definitely to defend Warsaw and was rushing there some of his best remaining units. After waiting so long, the die was being cast for the Pols. Many of the recruits to the Home Army were totally untrained. Now, the opportunity was grasped for some instruction in the use of their weapons. (gun fires) A few tanks were captured from the Germans in those early days, and some that had been damaged were hurriedly repaired. With the white eagle of old Poland proudly painted on them, these puny specimens were made ready to meet the might of the German Panzers. (bright marching band music) (cymbals crash) (bright marching band music) Medals were struck and distributed to some of the early heroes. Time was even taken off to celebrate weddings. (somber organ music) After being bottled up all those terrible years of German occupation, Polish cultural life burst forth again. (light playful music) The children of course were not forgotten. (children chattering) Cinemas were reopened, newsreels shot. The Polish people have long had a reputation for filmmaking, and most of these pictures that we see were taken by the brave cameramen of the resistance. Constantly exposed to danger, many of them, alas, did not survive the uprising. - [Survivor] Everybody was started publishing newspapers, every little political group, and there were daily press conferences held and the newspapers, even literary, many articles were published during the uprising. So, there was a great revival of Polish press, which before was in the underground, and in such a big numbers. And all these newspapers were read widely by the population of Warsaw. - And we even had one or two concerts organized by private citizens. One particular one I remember was in a private, beautiful sitting room typical before the wartime. Things still somehow survive, and elderly lady was playing a lot of Chopin music. (dramatic piano music) Even a postal service was begun, which issued its own stamps, though no letters bearing these stamps were ever to leave Warsaw during the uprising. (dramatic piano music) It was run by boy scouts who defied the German bullets, ducking under conduits and crawling through sewers to make sure the letters reached their destination within the day. It was all free. The recipients of letters were encouraged to donate books for the wounded to read. A veritable labyrinth of tunnels crisscrossing the German and Polish lines were springing up within free Warsaw, used not only by the postal boys, but also by the girl couriers carrying messages between the units. The ammunition, such as it was, was conveyed this way, too. (feet stomping rhythmically) The respite for the Warsaw Pols was short-lived. On the morning of the fifth day, Himmler's forces threw themselves on the city. A Saturday, it was soon to be known as Black Saturday. (guns firing) Every Pol in sight was shot, civilians and soldiers, old and young, women and even children. Nor were the sick and wounded in the hospital spared. 30,000 Pols lost their lives that day. The German casualties were six dead and about 30 wounded. So demoralized were the Pols, that if Himmler's butchers had concentrated more on capturing territory than killing people, the battle for Warsaw would've been decided then. (explosions booming) Ammunition, too, was fast running out on the Polish side. And as if that were not enough, the next day, a Sunday, August the 6th, the Stukas were sent in. (airplane screeching) (explosions booming) (missiles screeching) (explosions booming) The bombing of August the 6th shattered the Pols' system of communications and created havoc behind their lines. The atrocities of Black Saturday and the ferocious bombing of that terrible Sunday, made the Warsaw Pols fight that much more fanatically. It so happened that the regular German army, hearing of the atrocities, tried to put a stop to them, perhaps more for military efficiency than for reasons of morality. (citizens chattering) (guns firing) Cellars were turned into hospitals and the resources of doctors and nurses were soon being stretched to the limit. Drugs and dressings were in short supply and linen bandages quickly gave way to paper ones. - [Survivor] From time to time, some funeral was organized in a ceremonial way. We would stand around, you see, at attention. Somebody would recite a poem. Priest would say a few words about the hero who was killed. (guns firing) And then, even if the German bombs would come, you see, we would not move. And that sort of a feeling, you see, daily life is also full of ceremonies and we take them for granted. So, when the situation of danger comes, you can not really change your behavior too much. - [Narrator] Warsaw's squares and gardens were filling up with the graves of the fallen. 40,000 had died in the first week of the uprising. (birds chirping) (airplane rumbling) (explosion booms) - [Survivor] In big blocks of flats which had normally 10 or 12 apartments, there were sometimes five or 6,000 people concentrated, and therefore if the bomb fell on such a house, the casualties then were enormous. - [Survivor] It was harder for civilian population to sustain morale because they are confined to basements. They didn't have passes to run around Warsaw and they're not involved in action. In spite of all horrors, you know, the view of fire and smoke and the whole big drama of burning and at the same time very heroic city was tremendously impressive aesthetically. (fire crackling) - [Narrator] Water was needed to put out the fires. But most of the mains had been ruptured in the bombing and those wells within the city were soon buried beneath piles of rubble. It was not long before water was being rationed. (citizens chattering) Food was a problem from the start since the uprising was begun with only five days' supply of it for the whole Warsaw population. - But there was very little food, mainly soup with some, you know, macaroni or some kasha, things of that sort. Under those circumstances, one doesn't think much about food. We fell physically weak. And sometimes we would have some sort of, you know, nausea from hunger, but this was all. We did not have much meat. Sometimes somebody would kill a horse, you see, or a dog, and I could eat horse with reluctance. I was used to it because during the war from time to time, my grandmother would prepare, you know, the steak out of horse. But when they started killing dogs, you know, I like dogs very much. I would have felt cannibalistic eating dogs, so I never tried, you know. But I understand that people were even more hungry than I would eat try dogs. - There was no rats in Warsaw. Warsaw was in flame, burning city, and probably the rats has gone 'cause of heat. - One thing which was in quite of plenty food supply was sugar, lump sugar. We used to eat lump sugar, which I suppose sustained us. And alcohol was also in fairly large supply. One used to keep going by sipping from a bottle from time to time of alcohol. - Looking back, I think really I don't care at all about my life, about my food, my family even. - Because once I saw myself in the mirror and I said, oh, my legs became really so nice, so thin. I wish I could always have such nice legs. (chuckles) (explosion booms) - [Narrator] The uprising was begun with only enough ammunition for five days' fighting by the Pols, and so ways of supplementing this was soon at a premium. Unexploded German shells and bombs were emptied of their high explosive, which was then crammed into tin cans with a fuse attached to serve as hand grenades. Plumbers became gunsmiths. Craftsmen who had spent a lifetime fashioning watches or violins were pressed into manufacturing bullets and shells. (guns firing) (mortar pops) Mortars were made out of drainpipes, and car springs converted into catapults to hurl homemade petrol bombs. After the bombing of August the 6th, the pleas to London of the Warsaw Pols were answered in part by occasional airdrops from British planes. But the losses were high and most of the supplies fell into German hands. Churchill had asked Stalin to help the Pols since the Russians were nearest, but Moscow was being ominously silent. Roosevelt was reluctant to press the Russians unduly since the United States at that time was trying to persuade them to join in the war against Japan. But the airdrops were a great boost to Polish morale, and the antitank equipment that came this way stood them in good stead when the Germans resumed their attacks with heavy armor. (tank rattling) The German commander on the Eastern Front, General Guderian, wrote in his memoirs that the fighting for Warsaw in 1944 was far fiercer even than that at Stalingrad. (explosion booms) The fiercest fighting of all in Warsaw was that for the old heart of the city where the bulk of the Polish defenders had located themselves. Street by street, building by building, even brick by brick, the battle for Old Warsaw went. The Germans use their tanks to bombard the city from close quarters. (tanks rumbling) Polish resistance was stiff and German casualties heavy. Most of the German casualties were the work of Polish snipers stationed in the upper stories of the ruined buildings. (guns firing) With ammunition perilously scarce, a German for every bullet was the Polish slogan at this time. And it was very nearly achieved in the fighting for the Old Town. The Pols had their successes, particularly when on August the 20th they took the telephone exchange from which fanatical Ukrainian mercenaries of the German army had been harassing the defenders in the Old Town. A few days later, the German police headquarters was captured, many Polish hostages released, and some precious ammunition secured. (explosion booms) (guns firing) From then on, the battle for the Old Town grew in intensity as the Pols were surrounded and pushed into ever smaller positions. The German attackers had now doubled in numbers to 30,000 or so. (fire crackling) (guns firing) The worst fate of all befell the luckless 100,000 civilians crammed into the ancient heart of the city. - [Survivor] Bombing was continuous, absolutely continuous towards the end of my stay in Old Town. I just didn't hear it any longer. Artillery was constant, mortars were constant. Tanks were coming and they were just bombarding every street. Towards the end the fight was going from one house to another. At one point in Cathedral of St. John, Germans were at the great altar and our troops were at the choir. Literally, we were fighting from one room to another. (guns firing) There were dead all around, you see. But we would cover them with newspapers and we would not try to look at them. - [Survivor] I had been so upset. There's always smell of burning bodies and smell for the street of burning or decomposing horses. Everything was burning. It was very hot, by the way, very hot August and September. There was not a single drop of rain. And it was very bad for us because if it would be clouds, would be no German planes which was just picking up house after the house, mainly churches, mainly bigger building because they had been expecting to kill more people if they attack bigger object. - When the house was burned out, the heat kept in the basements in the bricks for quite a long time, and we used to remove those bricks and put potatoes in between them and bake potatoes this way, when they were available of course because not everybody had potatoes. - There was lots of praying, lots of religious behavior. There were also some fortune tellers who were doing this sometimes for money even, you know, for piece of bread. They're trying to predict what will happen, you know. They will tell about, oh, English planes are coming. American planes are coming. Any minute we are going to be liberated. So they perform important function of sustaining morale of those people who were not involved in action. (guns firing) (explosion booms) - [Narrator] Peace delegates from the German side were sent into the Old Town from time to time, but the Pols were not interested in surrendering, particularly as they had not been recognized yet by Hitler as enlisted competents due the rights of prisoners of war under the Geneva conventions. The British threatened reprisals against German prisoners held in Britain if the Pols were not properly treated. (explosions booming) The Germans meant business and even brought up their giant mortar, Thor, to add its pennyworth against the hapless defenders of the Old Town. Used previously only in the Siege of Sevastopol, it had to be fired from one and a half miles away. Each of its shells weighed more than two tons and they could penetrate a hundred inches of concrete. The fighting for the Old Town ended on September the 1st after 32 days. Those who could, escaped through the sewers to Polish positions elsewhere in the capital despite the Germans harassing them en route by dropping hand grenades down manholes and even injecting explosive gas. 2,300 soldiers and 3,000 civilians eluded the Germans in this way. Left behind were 2,500 badly wounded and 45,000 civilians, many of whom were now massacred by the enraged German attackers. After the Old Town fell, the Pols thought seriously of surrendering, particularly as the Germans now recognized them as competents. But suddenly, on September the 10th, the Soviets renewed their offensive against Warsaw and even offered to help the beleaguered Pols. Backed by a public opinion in Britain alarmed and embarrassed at Warsaw's plight, Churchill had been hammering away at Stalin despite the Soviet leader having dubbed the Warsaw defenders as criminal adventurers. German air reconnaissance had established that the Soviets had 60 airfields manned by 2,400 planes within easy reach of Warsaw. On September the 13th, a few Russian planes made token airdrops over Warsaw. Landing without parachutes, much of the equipment that didn't fall into German hands was too damaged to use. But some Soviet fighters did start appearing over Warsaw to deter the Stukas who had hitherto been having it all their own way, and some Soviet shells started falling on German positions within the capital. That same day, the Red Army, using mainly communist Polish units, forced the Germans back to the Vistula in front of Warsaw. The next day, the Germans blew all the bridges. On September the 16th, some of these Polish units managed to cross the Vistula and link up with the Warsaw defenders. But they suffered terrible losses mainly because they were newly conscripted and inexperienced and they were withdrawn to the east bank again. The Russians did not repeat the gesture. Stalin obviously felt he'd done enough to satisfy Churchill. (airplane engines rumbling) The United States Air Force on September the 18th mounted a big airdrop over Warsaw, having been allowed just this once to refuel at Soviet airfields. 110 Flying Fortresses flew from England. More than a thousand parachutes were seen to fall to the ground, but unfortunately, 90% fell into German hands. So small was the area of Warsaw still held by the Pols. Even so, it boosted the morale for awhile of the Warsaw defenders, but alas, was not to be repeated. The German garrison, as well as being unexpectedly resupplied from American sources, was also now reinforced with those units withdrawn across the Vistula through the action of the Red Army. The Warsaw Pols were thus doubly troubled, and one by one, their pockets of resistance were picked off as the German Panzers relentlessly pounded building after building. With their ammunition virtually gone, all the Pols had left was their fervor. The uprising produced many new patriotic songs. (group singing in foreign language) - [Survivor] I didn't see anybody in despair during the Warsaw insurrection. This is connected probably with our very Polish attitudes that we feel that the style of action is more important than the results of action. (group singing in foreign language) - If you look the Polish history, we committed these sort of acts of craziness since, oh, 1797 to defend our independence. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. And from that point of view, it was no other way. We always pay in blood for our independence and we never are lucky with our allies. - We found out by then that we couldn't account on any help from the Russians and our Western allies were unable to help us, so we were just like a rat cornered in the corner by two cats, and we were sure that we couldn't survive. So, one lost completely instinct for survival. Before when I used to cross barricades of the places which around the fire, I used to duck, but afterwards I was just walking erect and hoping that I will be killed by a bullet painlessly. - I did not expect Russian help because insurrection was both against Germans and against Russians. We wanted to liberate our own capital. - Well, if I climb to the top of the five-floor block of flats, I have seen this really Polish First Army, which under the Russian commands, and they even was washing in the Vistula on the opposite bank of Vistula. - [Narrator] On September the 29th, the Germans began a hurricane artillery bombardment of the remaining Polish positions. (artillery screeching) (explosions booming) (artillery pops) Moves had already been begun on the Polish side to negotiate a surrender. The go between was the president of the Polish Red Cross, Countess Tarnowska. Those last days of the struggle were the most agonizing of all for the civilians of Warsaw since by now they had no food, no water, nothing. The end came on October the 4th. First, the Germans allowed the civilians to leave. Their bewildered faces told the story. (somber orchestral music) The Polish commander, General Bor-Komorowski, came to his German opposite number's headquarters to complete the surrender formalities. He was offered a meal, which he clearly needed, but which he refused. Surprisingly, the Germans allowed the Pols to surrender honorably. No doubt, some of the German generals had their minds on possible war crimes trials in the future. 9,000 Polish soldiers surrendered. Another 3,500 preferred to escape Warsaw to continue the struggle elsewhere. The hopeless fight had lasted 10 long weeks, 63 days to be exact, twice as long as the Pols had held out against the Germans in September 1939. It had cost the lives, though, of nearly a quarter of a million Pols. The German casualties were only a few thousand. Once the remaining citizens had been driven from the city, Warsaw was systematically destroyed. Hitler was determined it should never rise again. (explosion booms) (building materials crashing) (fire crackling) (flamethrowers hissing) (fire crackling) (explosion booms) (building materials crashing) - [Survivor] Somebody once said that if you take a handful of Warsaw soil and squeeze it that blood will run from it. (somber violin music) - [Narrator] On January the 17th, 1945, 15 weeks after the surrender and 25 weeks after the beginning of the uprising, the Red Army entered Warsaw. Today, in a rebuilt Warsaw, a Russian-backed government rules in Poland. (dramatic piano music)
