Morning. (scissors snipping) Mr. and Mrs. Irtley, this is Mr. Jenkins, lawyer for the highway department. - Good morning. Come in, come in please. Deed reads Jesse Cato Irtley and family. - Well there's three kids outside. - Well let's get on with it. I've got to be in court in Valdosta at 11 o'clock. - Mrs. Irtley, would you bring them in here please? - We thought it would be best if they wait outside. - Very well, we'll have to have their names. What are they please? - There's Bruvver, Naomi, and J.C. - How do you spell Bruvver? - Excuse me sir, I don't think Bruvver is his Christian name. Mrs. Irtley, what is Bruvver's real name? - He was christened Lonnie. - Then we named him Yule for Mr. Brown who gave us the land back, but mostly we call him Bruvver. - Lonnie Yule, and the girl? - Naomi, right out of the Bible. - Mhmm, and the other one? - J.C. - Another biblical reference? - Huh? - I say do the initials have any religious connotation? - Does J.C. have to do with the Bible? - Has to do with J.C Penney. - J.C. Penney? - Yes sir. There was a sale the week I birthed him. - All right, all right J.C. Now the aforementioned property has been condemned by the county due to the lack of cooperation of the party of the first part. - Again? - [Man] We've merely taken a piece of your property for which you will be well paid. And we're not coming any closer to your house. - However, party of the first part will be duly compensated upon receipt of your several signatures, you will receive a remittance for the aforementioned property in the amount of $8,000. - Say what? - $8,000. - [Jenkins] If you'll just sign, I'll have a check for you. - We don't want no check. - Want folding money. - Mrs. Irtley, a check is legal tender. - We don't want no legal. - Want the money. - Very well if you will just endorse here please. - Sign this and he'll get the money. - Right here? - Yes, right here. - No, I mean the money right here. - Yes yes. - Inez Rose Fergie Irtley. Pa. (scissors snipping) Bruvver! You drive that thing over here in front of the store. - Ma give me a quarter for a cold drink. - Oh hush up. - Thanks! (gentle country music) - Some of that shine. - Sorry what's that? - Shine. (gentle country music) (bell dings) (ominous music) - Good afternoon sister Irtley, brother, youngins. May God bless you and yours. My name is Reverend Cole. The Reverend Jeremiah Cole. I'm from Florida. I've been holding the revival of the open door over at Twin Rivers, and it's my pleasure to kindly just drop by and say howdy to the better folks in this neck of the woods, and make sure you knowed about our meetings and the wonderful work we are doing in His name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Pleased to meet you. Bruvver get the wagon around to the shed. Naomi, you help me unload the wagon. - Well. Well sister it seems the Lord has smiled upon you with good health and good fortune. Yea let the little children come unto me and so forth, amen. And how was your journey, sister? Fruitful, I hope. The weather has been dry. It parches a man's throat. - Bless your heart, brother. Brother Irtley, tell me just what is it you've got in that paper sack brother? It couldn't be spirits of one form or another, could it? Well now suffer no shame, suffer no shame. The first time I seen you, I thought you looked peaked, and beyond any shadow of doubt I'm sure that whatever purchase you made, you made for purely medicinal purposes. - That's the God's truth, reverend. (coughing) - Don't worry about me. Don't pay me no mind, it's just my heart brother. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. (hacking) Sustenance brother, sustenance for my throat. (gulping) Do you feel anything? Do you feel the Lord working on you? The Lord's been mighty good to you, but with all this bounty he has also placed a responsibility upon your head, and you've got to face up to it, that is if you value your soul. Do you value your soul? Do you want to dwell forevermore in Beulah Land, or do you want to spend all eternity roasting in the fires of hell? The decision is up to you, because I said that Beelzebub is fixing to claim you for his fiery army. Now it's up to you, it's up to you, what are you going to do? Is it going to be the golden streets or to the fiery furnace? - Oh golden streets reverend, golden streets. - And I'm glad to hear that. Down on your knees, down on your knees and you beg for forgiveness! Repent, repent, hallelujah and amen! (laughs) Hold on brother, we ain't near finished! You been a sinner. You've been away from the church. You've been away from the church too many years. The devil's got hold of your coattails. I'll tell you that if you was to die right this minute, old Satan would claim you for his army of darkness. You'd go to hell so damn fast it'd make your head spin, and I ain't kidding ya. Nosiree, you been a drunkard, you been a sinner and a backslider. Where'd you put it? You've been in every kind of hatefulness I can think of. Well I'm telling you right now you ain't gonna get away with it. There's only one way in this whole world of sin that you can wipe clean that dirty slate. Now you listen to me, I tell you it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man like you to enter the kingdom of heaven. I'll tell you it came to me and in case you don't understand, I'll tell you it came to me in a cloud of sulfur, brimstone, and hellfire. The Lord wants your money. I am his messenger, and his servant, and the Lord wants it right now, do you hear what I'm saying? - Well. Here's two dollars. - Two dollars! Two dollars, that's what it was the last time you paid for anything, and that's just the sin I'm talking about, two dollars. The Lord hates a piker, and so do I. Down on your knees you penny pinching sinner! Ain't you never heard it's better to give than to receive? - You are gonna get out of our house you beady-eyed flat wooden-jawed old pronk! You get out of here with that talk! - Calm yourself woman, calm yourself! - You take those lies and hate out of our house! You get yourself off this land with your boozy breath and your damnation talk. - But I'm trying to save all your souls. You come into the service of the Lord. - Get off this land would ya? - I'm going madam. Calm yourself! - [Ma] Take your fat behind back to Twin Rivers-- - [Reverend] Calm yourself woman, calm yourself! - [Ma] Get going, move! Go go go go go! We know more about the Bible than you ever dreamed of. - [J.C.] Move, go off, my ma-- - Got nothing but dollar signs in your big eyes. (laughing) (Naomi giggling) (Naomi shrieks) I still don't like it. I still have the feeling we're being punished. - Punished, what for? - Well that's just it, we're being punished and I don't know for what. - Well the Lord will provide. - Amen. He works in mysterious ways. All of a sudden out of the blue, $8,000. - The good book says the Lord never sends us a burden we cannot bear. - Amen.
