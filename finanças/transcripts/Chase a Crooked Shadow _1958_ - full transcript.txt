The village of Tamaru. How far is it from the villa? - Three miles. And from Barcelona? - Eighty. Another part of the coast. And there. That's the villa. Right up in the top. Is that the main entrance? Yes. It faces away from the sea, through the courtyard. There is another entrance on the terrace at the back of the house. Up those steps. And that window on the corner. That's her bedroom. Where does the path lead to? - Down to the beach house. Now call the villa. Just in case there's been a chance of plan. I want Tossa 8241 please. Thank you. There is something I want you to see. Very pretty, isn't she. - Listen to this. "Kimberley Prescott, the South African heiress .." "Returns this week to her villa on the coast of Spain." "The tragic suicide of her father the diamond magnate McKenzie Prescott." "Made headlines a year ago." "Her brother." "Amateur racing driver Ward McKenzie Prescott .." [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] No. Miss Prescott has not arrived yet. She will be coming later. She is expecting some friends to dinner. Who shall I say is calling? No change. If they keep Spanish hours they probably won't leave until after one. Goodnight, Kim. - Goodnight. Goodnight. You know, I can remember the days when I used to send you to bed at seven. Is it seven yet? Oh, I'm dead, it's nearly one-thirty. You know. I hope those enthusiasts don't ring me up at dawn and want to go fishing. Well, take the phone off the hook. That's what I always do. That's a good idea. I think I will. We have a date for lunch tomorrow, haven't we? Pick you up about noon? - Yes, fine. Are you sure it's not going to be too much for you? Remember you came here to rest. Will you stop treating me like an invalid. I'm perfectly alright. And don't you dare be a minute late. Goodnight, uncle Chand. Is there anything else, Senorita? No thank you, Maria. Don't wake me in the morning. I am very tired. Si, Senorita. Buenos noches, Senorita. Goodnight, Maria. [ Footsteps ] [ Footsteps ] Is somebody there? Is that you, Maria? Who is it? Hello, Kim. Who are you? I think you know who I am. I presume you're from one of the other villas and you've had too much to drink. Wrong both times, Kim. In any case you've got no business here. Will you please go. Will you get out of here! Maria! Maria! Was that uncle Chand I saw leaving just now? You must hand it to him, getting this place opened up at such short notice. It can't have been easy after so long. Wonderful, the way he was foster uncle to the Prescott children over the years. What do you know about it? I never saw you before in my life. Now, are you going or shall I call the police? The same old Kim. By the way, the magazines didn't waste any time either. You're on the front page of this month's International Society. Did you know? "Kimberly Prescott returns to the Villa Del Mar." The unhappy heiress and so on. Nicely done. I thought it made a good story. Or don't you agree? Alright. You've had your chance to leave. Now you can just wait for the police. Hello? This is Kimberly Prescott at the Villa Del Mar. I want the police. Si .. the Policia. Comisario Vargas. Senorita. Senorita, please. Please begin at the beginning. What has happened? Please speak more slowly. Huh? Right .. I will come at once. In a few minutes. Villa Del Mar? I see. I know it. Senor Comisario? Yes, my name is Vargas. I'm sorry to bring you all the way out here. I know it is very late. Never too late to be of assistance to a beautiful lady. Where is this man? - I can't get him out. He simply refuses to leave. I was worried. I have valuable jewellery. Oh, cut it out Kim. What is this anyway? What in the world are you trying to pull? If you don't mind Senor, I will ask the questions. I wish you'd take him away. It's late and I'm tired. Not too tired to enjoy a joke. You know, you ought to be spanked for this. Senor. Come in won't you. Senor, I am afraid I must ask for your papers. Credentials. Alright Kim. If you want to play games, let's play games. My International Driving License. A letter of credit from the Union Bank of South Africa. If you have your passport, Senor? - Of course. I am sorry, Senorita. But I do not like games in the middle of the night. Games? Perhaps you think you can make fools of the police? What are you talking about? This is absurd. My brother is dead. Dead? I'm afraid I should apologize for my sister. She has our father's sense of humour. You could never tell what he was going to do. Just a minute, Senor. One thing at a time. About yourself, first. Yes, of course. Well .. I just arrived from Johannesburg. I motored up from Madrid. Liar. - I got to the house. He's lying. My brother's dead. - Senorita. You don't understand. My brother Ward is dead. Dead men do not carry passports and credentials, Senorita. Why do you insist on this foolishness? In the middle of the night. You will read about it in the gossip columns tomorrow. The Prescott humour rides again. Young heiress has her brother arrested. To the great embarrassment of the local police. I assure you, Senor. There will be no arrest. And no embarrassment. And the local police. Say goodnight. - Please .. Please, you've got to listen. You've got to believe me. My brother Ward was killed over a year ago in South Africa. His car went over a cliff. I even had to identify the body. There was a funeral .. all our friends. Newspaper stories. Senorita, I would like to believe you but .. I cannot ignore the facts. After all, what can I do? There is his passport. His photograph. Passport photograph. When has anyone ever looked like their passport photograph? Wait, wait. Wait. You want photographs? I'll give you some. I've two photographs of Ward up in bedroom. Senorita. [ Spanish language ] Maria, show him. Senor. How long is it since you saw your sister? I am not his sister. Not for over a year. At least, not since the accident. Oh. So there was an accident? Oh yes, of course. But I wasn't in it. You see, I'd given a lift to a chap on the road that morning. As it turned out he gave me the ride, with a knock on the head. He took my wallet, chucked me in the ditch and drove off. May I have permission to use my own phone? Chandler Bridson, the architect. You must know him. He'll tell you who is lying. Tossa, 3-1-1-6. Senor. If all this happened so long ago .. I was still unconscious when they found me the next day. I was in hospital for months. Suffering from amnesia no doubt. Well, it's all there in the hospital records if you'd care to check up. It can't be. Will you .. will you try again. Excuse me. Hello? Comisario Vargas. Si. [ Spanish language ] Bridson. Bridson. "Hello .. hello, hello?" "Hello .. hello?" Oh. Gracias. The line is out of order. She says maybe the receiver is off. Ah. No. No. Don't you see? He must have changed the pictures while we were having dinner or something. He's taken Ward's pictures out and put his own in. Wait. Wait. I remember. Ward had a small tattoo. An anchor on .. On this wrist. Kim, I think Senor Vargas is getting fed up with this nonsense. Would you mind, Senor? Why don't you drop it for your own sake? Stop it! It is enough for one night, Senorita. There will be no more of this. If there is, I will have to arrest you. And I'm not joking. Now please don't be angry with her, Senor. If I hadn't written when I was arriving she couldn't have planned all this. I am not angry, Senor. If anything, I am, how do you say .. Intrigued. She is spoiled, I suppose. She's always had her own way. And of course, she's very highly strung. We have good doctors in Barcelona. You must let me know if .. It's caused us a lot worry in the past. I quite understand. Not everything mind you, but .. Still. Let me know if I can be of help. - I will. Thank you. Goodnight, Senor Comisario. - Goodnight. Senor Prescott. There must be some way. Please. Couldn't you just try once more? Uncle Chand's line still out of order? Too bad. You know, I could use another drink. How thoughtless of me. I should have offered one to the Comisario. I'm forgetting my hospitality. You know, this is a beautiful room. But then father never had anything but the best. Why shouldn't he? The king of diamonds. You know, it's a pity I didn't spend more time here in the old days. Why didn't you just drop in? No, seriously. I should have made the effort. Father would have appreciated it. Yes .. I can imagine. They say he always knew how to make the best of a diamond. This place is a perfect setting for you, Kim. Spain. The coast. This villa. I only wish that father were alive to enjoy it. But he's not. There is just the two of us now. Just you and I. You've arranged all this very cleverly. I don't know where you got your information. But I see what you're after. I just hope you realize what a gamble you're taking. You think you can keep this up for a few days. So that no-one interferes when you help your sister dispose of her jewellery. Isn't that it? Here. Here. Take it. It's insured. Take it and get out. Kim dear, what's the matter with you? The police have gone now. The joke is over. Remember this? Three years ago. The summer that you were ditched by that tennis player. What was his name? Murray Harris. What do you want? You are not my brother. I know you are not. My keys. Are you looking for these? You left hem in the car again, Kim. That's a pretty bad habit. Here. Go on. Take them. You are not a prisoner here. But I sure you know it will be silly to run away. I'd only have to bring you back and that might mean the hospital again. Hospital? I'm only going by what I've heard. After father's death and the trouble with the company and everything else. It was quite understandable. Poor Kim. You've been through a pretty bad time. Acute anxiety. Isn't that what they call it? No. No, I wasn't that sick. I wasn't. That's what you tried to make out but the doctors seemed to think you were. And they'd think so again, Kim. Ward's car! The one he was killed in. Of course I had her rebuilt. Look, you've had a rough night. Why don't you try and get some sleep? Kim, your keys. Senorita. Would you try that Tossa number for me again please. But I've got to get through. I've been trying all night. No. No, never mind. Not important. Not important. Good morning, Miss Prescott. I am Elaine Whitman. A friend of your brother's. Where is Maria? Where's my maid? She has gone to Barcelona for the weekend. Ward said it would be alright. I imagine she must find it rather lonely here. This one does go on your table doesn't it? How dare you come into my room! Who are you? What are you doing here? I've told you. I'm a friend of your brother's. He is waiting for you on the terrace. Oh, by the way. He asked me to give you these. I'll tell him you'll be down shortly? Such a lovely day, Miss Prescott. We don't want to waste it, do we. Ah, good morning, Kim. I hope you don't mind. We've had breakfast already. I believe you've met Mrs Whitman. She'll be our guest for a while. I'm sure you two will get along. - I'm sure we will. There you are. It's about time too. You must be starved. This is Carlos, our new butler. I .. shan't be having any breakfast. You see, I'm going out. With uncle Chandler. He is picking me up in about half an hour. He should be very happy to see you here. Oh, I's so sorry. I quite forgot. Mr Bridson telephoned early this morning. Before she left, Maria gave your regrets and said you'd be away for the weekend. Some of your South African friends were passing through Madrid. It was a chance to see them before they went home so you flew down to join them. The telephone in the beach house. It's alright. There is nothing to worry about. Senorita. Senorita, I reported this number was out of order last night. Senorita, por favor .. - May I come in? Why bother to ask? You didn't last night. Ah, the spear-fishing equipment. That takes me back a bit. It used to be a lot of fun. Even though you were always better than me. That's new. Where did you get it? - In Paris. Ward gave it to me the summer before last. He picked it up in a little shop in Montmartre. Really? That's funny. The summer before last I was in Rome. With the Carters. I haven't been to Paris for three years. You don't forget a thing, do you. I'm going to change. Fix me a drink, will you. Isn't it a little early in the day? Oh, that doesn't sound much like a Prescott. Well, I've had to watch myself since the accident. What will it be? Why Mr Prescott, I'm surprised. My swimming drink, of course. You know, it was years before I even knew that drink had a name. To me it was just .. Our swimming drink. Remember the first time you fixed it for me? My first big party. I wasn't supposed to drink. I was only sixteen. And then you sneaked one out to me and we all went swimming. It's funny, the little things that stay in your mind. How is it coming? Try it. Not too much cassis? Not too much soda. No. It's exactly the way Ward made it. If on my theme I rightly think. There are five reasons why I drink. Good wine. A friend. Because I'm dry. Or lest I should be, by and by. Or any other reason why. - Any other reason .. You know our toast too. Alright. Ward McKenzie Prescott is back. Why? For the Prescott money? Well there is not nearly as much as there used to be. The Prescott name? There is not so much of that left either. The villa? It's obvious you like it here. You want the villa. Lunch will be in 45 minutes, Kim. No breakfast. No lunch. I'm worried about her. She'll eat when she's hungry. If she wants to sulk, Carlos can take her up a tray later on. We can't hope to keep her a prisoner here. I've come to see Senor Bridson. This is Senorita Prescott. I am sorry. Senor Bridson is not here. He must be. I've been trying to reach him. You see, we had an appointment for lunch. I am sorry, Senorita. Some of his friends from the hotel .. They called this morning and he went away fishing. I do not know what time he comes back. Thank you. But Senorita, we have laws. I must go by the law. That's all I'm asking Senor Vargas. There must be some law to get him out of my house. If the villa belonged only to you but after all, he is your brother .. Don't keep saying that. He is not! You thought I was joking last night. It would have been a good joke wouldn't it? To have had my brother arrested and put in jail at two o'clock in the morning. Alright. Is it still a joke? Why would I go on denying it? What reason would I have? Oh please. You've got to believe me. You do not make it very easy for me, Senorita. I would like to believe you. Very much, I want to help. Tell me something he has done. Has he stolen anything? Has he put his hand on you? Has he threatened you? No .. no, that's just it. I don't know what he wants. And I don't care. All I want you to do is get rid of him. After all, isn't that what the police are for? Unfortunately, it is not quite as simple as you seem to imagine. Look. He is a foreigner. He comes to this country with a passport and his credentials perfectly in order. It would appear that he is rich and influential. Now, what do I do? Throw him into prison? Create an international incident? Senorita. There must be dozens of things that you could do. Records .. Official records. The death certificate. The death certificate in South Africa. The death certificate? But Senorita. It was you who identified the body. Oh, I know what you're going to say. It was Ward. It was! You want to believe what he says? His passport. His papers. A lot of rubber stamps and photographs. The could have been forged, you know. - Certainly. But why? Senorita Prescott, why? People with forged passports do not usually behave as your brother. Or .. as this man behaves. I had better tell you this. This morning. I made enquiries at the bank. His letter of credit is perfectly genuine. As a rule, banks are very particular about these matters. So you see .. I am only being .. Logical. I must be. It is obvious. You have no intention of helping me. I am very sorry I cannot be of more assistance. I hope .. you will appreciate my position. I deal in crimes that are committed, Senorita. Not crimes that are .. imagined. Crimes that are imagined? Very well, Comisario Vargas. We shall see. You left your keys in the lock again. I had Carlos take the Bentley home. As a matter of fact it may not be a bad idea if you didn't drive for a while. Until you get a hold of yourself. The car feels sort of heavy today. I must be getting out of shape. At least you must admit I picked a good place to stop. That's quite a view. Well, you don't have to talk. Would you like to smoke? Where did you get that? This .. This cigarette case. It was my brother's. Of course it is mine. My brother's. I know. You gave it to me when I won the Rand Trophy. I gave that case to Ward. Now you're getting upset again. No wonder this means so much to me. That was quite a race. One of the toughest tracks in the world and some of the toughest drivers. Do you remember I used to stage my own races around here? Almost four miles around the bay in three minutes flat. Just for fun. Do you remember? I was four years younger. Four years crazier. Ward could still do it. Ward could do it now. Kim. Do I have to prove it to you? I dare you. Go on. I dare you. What are we aiming for? Three minutes? Three minutes flat. Three-O-four. Ah, I told you I was out of shape. What's the matter, frightened? You never used to be. You meant to do this. You meant to frighten me. You had it all planned. Oh now Kim, be reasonable. It was your idea. And you always said I could handle a car better than anyone else in the world. Do you remember the old days Kim, when I first started driving? And father was so against it. You were the one that always encouraged me. Go on, I dare you. They were good days, Kim. The best we ever had. We were both young. We didn't give a darn about anything. Company profits were hitting the skies. Neither of us believed it would ever end. Take me home. I want to go back. What you really need is a drink. Feeling better? Let's just say I'm glad to be alive. Well come to think of it, so am I. Si, gracias. Why did you do that? Now don't be ungracious, Kim. The Prescott sense of humour. I can see you're feeling better already. So let's talk, shall we. Let's talk about diamonds. And the Transvaal Company. And Ward McKenzie Prescott senior. No, Kim. Not until we've talked about the diamonds. Ten million's worth. Stored away in the company vaults. Stockpiled over the years. Father's whole life. We needn't go into the details of how the company crashed. How the shares were bought out behind father's back. But that wasn't why he killed himself, was it, Kim? To listen to you talking about my father. I was there. I know what happened. What is it you want? All that happened over a year ago. It's finished. Not quite finished, Kim. Let's return to the time the new company took over. Can't you just imagine it? They have control. They have the stock certificates in their hands. But what they want to see is diamonds. So they go to the vaults and what do they find? Nothing. The vaults are cleaned out. Empty. The biggest diamond haul in history. Where are those stones now? You didn't sell them. What did you do with them? I don't know what you say. The diamonds simply disappeared. Nobody knows where. Nobody in the whole world. - Nobody but you. April the 14th, just after father's death. You left Johannesburg for New York. Your tickets were booked via London but you never got to London did you, Kim? You left the plane at Cairo. Cairo, Kim. Remember? Ward, Ward. We have a visitor. - Vargas? - Yes. And he's brought Chandler Bridson with him. You know what to do. - Don't worry. I know what to do. Uncle Chand? Uncle Chand! Easy .. easy now. Help me. Help me, uncle Chand. I've been so desperate. I tried so hard to reach you but I .. They said you'd gone away. - I know, I know. Senor Vargas told me all about it. Oh, it's been the most terrible nightmare. I was ready to believe I was losing my mind. You are not to worry about a thing. I'm here now. We'll soon find out what it's all about. Uncle Chandler. Ward. It's true then. Ward, my boy. I don't know what to say. I couldn't believe it. What happened? No, I don't care what happened. Just so long as you're back. So long as you're here with us again. Don't worry. Everything is under control. What happened? We didn't expect you until tomorrow? Vargas was worried about Kimberly. When my telephone wasn't answered for so long he came to the house. Did you have to bring him here? Of course, I must pretend to be worried too. I insisted on coming at once. - Just a minute, uncle Chandler. I think we're going a little too fast for Kim. Yes. Yes, you are a bit. Particularly you, uncle Chand. The last and only person in the whole world I thought I could trust. I should very much like to know what's going on. Yes. Yes, I think it is time you told her. Why don't you sit down, Kim. I will try to explain. I'll get the file. You see, Ward and I have kept a few notes. Let's pick it up where we left off this afternoon. We know that you flew to Cairo that day. Perhaps you'd like to tell us where you went from there? I went to the States. I broke my journey because .. Because I wasn't well. I rested for a couple of days. Then I caught the plane to New York. New York? Are you quite sure? Of course. I tell you I went to New York. No you didn't. Not until twelve days later. What are you talking about? Still about diamonds, Kim. Those millions piled away. You are all wasting your time. Those diamonds are lost. Nobody will ever find them. Nobody. Anglo-Hispano Bank Ltd. Tangiers. That's where you went Kim, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Alright. I did go there. I admit it. I went to Tangiers. The only place in the world where no-one can get at a bank deposit. Even through international law. But just in case you forgot, I signed the deposit slip for those stones. And only my signature can get them out. That's right, Kim. Only your signature. Come on Kim, you must have known you couldn't get away with it. What on earth were you thinking of? What are you thinking of? Do you imagine you will get away with it? Don't say you want to give the diamonds back to the Transvaal Company. No, that's not the idea at all, is it uncle Chand. This is quite hopeless. Why don't we let the police decide? You wouldn't want that, would you Kim? If I do what you want. Will you promise to go away and leave me alone? That's all I ask. Just to be left alone. Come along, Miss Prescott. All you have to do is sign this. "Anglo-Hispanic Bank Ltd, Tangiers." "This will introduce my .." "My agent and brother." "Ward McKenzie Prescott." Thank you. Mrs Whitman, see Carlos and tell him we'll have drinks out on the terrace. Certainly. Champagne, I think. Champagne on the terrace? That sounds rather pleasant, doesn't it. Look, why don't you try to get an early night. Have a good sleep. You'll feel better in the morning. What about you? Aren't there things that keep you awake? Tell me the truth. You are not Ward. Uncle Chandler believes I am. Why can't you? Because I saw him. I saw him after he was dead. Are you absolutely sure it was Ward? How could I make a mistake about that? My own brother. I heard you talking. Did she have anything to say? Not much. Well. What did you talk about? Conscience. She doesn't think that I have a conscience. Has she? She is very pretty, isn't she. I imagine she can be quite charming when she wants to. Not too charming, I hope. Carlos? Mrs Whitman? Carlos! Mrs Whitman! I heard you calling about the house. I thought perhaps you might like some milk. Do try it. I'm sure it will help you sleep. Is that you Carlos? Si, Senor. I have been to put the Bentley away but Miss Prescott must have taken the keys. She is learning. That is not good, I think. - Let me worry about that. I worry too, Senor. Carlos. - Si, Senor? Would you mind bringing out the B&B? Of course, Senor. You must be very much frightened, Senorita. Now. Perhaps at last you would like to tell me why. I am sure it was not me you wanted to kill. No. Come, I want to know the truth. People do not try to commit murder without reason. Why do wish to kill this man? Because .. he wants to kill me. You don't believe me? You don't believe. Look .. there is your proof. He will make me sign it. You see. You see, it leaves everything to .. My brother. What more do you need? Everything. You mean the diamonds too? The diamonds? Belonging to the Transvaal Company. You know about them? Yes. Every policeman in the world has read how they have disappeared. So mysteriously. Of perhaps .. Not so mysteriously. Senorita. Was it you who took them? No. No it wasn't. I swear it wasn't. Ward stole them from the vaults. My brother. My brother Ward. You see. My father was getting old. And he was sick. He was losing control of the company. The diamonds were the last remaining asset he had. And I knew if he found out that Ward had taken them .. It would destroy him completely. I tried to stop him from leaving the country. I fought with him. I begged him. I did everything I knew how. But he wouldn't listen. He laughed at me. Oh you. You have to understand my brother. He never thought of anyone but himself. The only thing he ever cared about was having what he called a good time. That and car racing. We never saw him except when he needed money. And now he was going to take what he could and get out. And leave his father to look like a criminal. And finally. Finally, when he drove off. I was desperate. I didn't know what to do. A little while later. The phone rang. There had been an accident. His car had crashed. He was killed. I had to go to the hospital. To identify his body. Somehow I got through the formalities. And then. Then you see, they gave me his things. You know, his .. His bags .. his personal effects. I was the only person that knew. The diamonds were in his luggage. So I .. I drove to the office. And I thought. If I could just get them back to my father. You must have loved your father very much. When I arrived. The police met me. And then they told me. That my father .. Had shot himself. I guess I must have been very ill. The doctors came in and out. I know that. And then you see, much later .. When I began to come out of it. I realized. I still had the diamonds. Surely, the right thing to do would have been to go to the police? I couldn't. I couldn't go over all that again. To explain, to answer questions. To drag my father's name through the newspapers a second time. So you ran away? - Of course. Where did you run to? Yes, I ran away. I put the stones in Tangiers. And I went to America. Tangiers? - I know. I know. It was stupid. I know it was wrong. I was just so sick. I was half out of my mind. And alone. So you see, this man in my house. He isn't Ward, He couldn't be. Do you believe me? Yes. I will believe you. But now, Senorita. You must make a bargain with me. What? A bargain? I will help you. If you will promise to return the diamonds. To the Transvaal Company. Alright. I promise. Good. Now listen. If this man is not your brother. Then his passport, his credentials. They are false, yes? Yes. For that he can be punished. A long time in jail. He is very clever, very thorough. You've seen that yourself. But for one thing. His fingerprints. Get the glass. I came back for the brandy, Senor. She was out here on the terrace. What are you doing down here? I was taking a walk. Down by the shore. At this time of night? - I do it lots of times. My room was hot. I couldn't sleep. Alright, Carlos. You can go. Everything is under control. So I decided to have a drink. Out of my glass? I was taking your glass to the bar when Carlos frightened me. I wish you'd tell him to stop sneaking around like that. He frightened me half to death just now. It's his job to look after the terrace. At this time of night? What were you doing up? My room was hot. I couldn't sleep. Maybe a drink would help? No thanks. I've had a drink. Well. It .. seems a shame to waste it. Dad's best B & B. Please. I hate to drink alone. You're very quiet tonight. And you don't talk much, do you. Except about unpleasant things. Is there anything else? There could be. Silly of me, isn't it. Under the circumstances. But if the circumstances were different. If you weren't .. who you are. Then what would we talk about? What would you think of me then, I wonder? This is pointless, Kim. Yes, but it is rather fascinating, isn't it. You're not fascinated. Not in the least. It is late, Kim. Time we locked up. Carlos. You're are being very na?ve. You've always had everything you wanted, haven't you. An only daughter, a favourite child. A rich father who thought you were just about perfect. It's too bad he found out just before he died. I ought to hate you more than anyone in the world. Not half as much as I ought to hate you. Excuse me. I hope I'm not interrupting. We were just having a drink. With one glass? Isn't two on one glass a little personal? She has her own glass. Where is your glass? In your hand, Mr Prescott. Can't you see the lipstick? What happened to my glass? I don't know. I didn't know it was yours. You put it right down there. Where is it now? Why ask me? - Where is it? I don't know. I don't know. - You are lying. Let her go. She must have had someone planted out here. Nothing to worry about of course. Only a crystal brandy glass. With a lovely set of your fingerprints on it. Who is helping her? That's the first thing. If we can figure out who's helping her. - Someone she met today? No, she wasn't alone for one second. - Not this morning? Wait. Vargas .. I'll bet it was Vargas! Nonsense. We've got him completely convinced. She's talked him around somehow. I don't know how but she's smart. Sure. That's why she was down at the beach. That's where they met. And Vargas is a policeman remember. He'd know about fingerprints. Get her down here. I'm not going to let him foul us up now. Hello? Hello operator. What's the delay? Hello? I said get her down here. Come on, move. And don't worry about Vargas. I'll take care of him. I didn't spend a year planning this thing for nothing. Hello? Operator? Operator, hello? Operator. Operator, this is urgent.

You could do a little diving. Yes, why not. Kim? I'm sure I can count on you. You always loved to swim. You'd better be careful taking Miss Prescott out there.
