M. Gorkiy Central Studio of Films for Children and Youth The Third Creative Association Comet Hello. I am... Well, I am Tuzik. This strange and extraordinary story started on the day when this antique sailing vessel was brought here. For some reason they put it on the shore. I've never seen a ship like this before, even though I've lived here on the seaside a few years already. That's all! You can depart! Thank you! - Mr. Pavel? - Yes. The actor Patokin is sick. What do you mean, sick? What a piece of news. Mr. Pavel! The sets for the episode "Pirate's Ship on the Shore" are ready. I scheduled the shooting for 7 am tomorrow. - Cancel it. Without that actor... - What? How? ...we can't shoot on the ship. - What should we do? - I don't know. What should we do? Maybe we could shoot the shore of a desert island? Oh well... This is no desert island... We cannot tell everyone to go away. Everyone has the right to rest. What should we do? Let's switch to - Desert scenes. - Okay. We're going to shoot - a treasure hunt episode. - Right! Going to shoot a treasure hunt episode... Treasure hunt! Right. You're in charge of the ship. And I mean it! Right. So we're going to the desert now. Let's go! - We're shooting... - I seriously mean it! ...treasure hunt, is that clear? This is outrageous. My name is Lumber, I am from Epiphany. What's Epiphany got to do with it? I am on vacation. Good for you! Keep on... I'm bored. This is my 3rd month of vacation. I volunteer to help. - With what? - With everything! - I can clear the crowd from the beach. - Okay. I can stand in for that Patokin. I can be the ship's captain. - What do you want in return? - Nothing! Just volunteering. Then I'll have a delicate task for you. Okay. Sign here. - Yep. - And here. - Yep. - Your doggy will get an allowance. Remember, it is worth 200 thousand. Oh my. If anything happens, you'll be paying off damages 'til the end of your life. I will not let you down. You're not a simple guard, you're a guardian now! Beware of romantically inclined people. Especially those who make fires! I understand everything. Most importantly, keep an eye on cabin 2. What can happen in 3 weeks? In 3 weeks Alexander the Great conquered Persia! Did he? Oh, why did my master Vassiliy agree to guard this ship? No entrance under any circumstances Of course, I am attached to my master. Sure thing, I'd like him to be happy. Crowd sail! All hands on deck! Stand by the sheets and check the knots! Give her more rudder! Steady on one eight two! Right so! Citizens beachgoers! Do not swim too far into the sea. It can be dangerous. I repeat. Citizens, beachgoers! Do not swim too far into the sea. It can be dangerous. Stop! Put your hands up! Haven't you seen a sign? I haven't. No entrance under any circumstances. Should I leave? I'd like to rent a cabin. I can pay really well. It's not for rent, it's for a film. Treasure Island? Flying Dutchman. Right. You look familiar. Are you an actor? What's your surname? It's Heaps. And you, are you a romantic person? No. Please leave the ship. Didn't work. I remember that I heard voices and ran up to see if I may help. Doggy's also an artist? Can he speak? What does it have to do with this? - Bye. - Bye. Didn't work. Then we heard that someone else came up to the ship. Jolly good! D-d-d-don't shoot! Have you seen a sign? No entrance under any circumstances. Well.. My glasses are broken. And how do you manage without them? We have one pair among the two of us. Please, be kind. Allow us to rest here a little bit. May we? Yes, you may. Over there. Ouch, I twisted my ankle. Please, tell us: this steamboat, is it occupied? You guard it, right? Yes, I am in charge. They'll burn it. Why? They'll see it, get inside, turn it into a den of iniquity and burn it. - Dear God... - Will they? - Why do you upset a comrade? - C'est la vie. Besides, he can allow a positive non-smoking person to settle in here to hold back bandits! Am I right, comrade sailor? No way! Tuzik, follow me! Mom, Mom! I'm afraid! Gennadiy, do something! Mommy! Why did you climb it? It's dangerous! Mommy! Why are you just standing there? Our son's in danger! Calm down, little one! You shouldn't panic! Hey, boy, jump! Do it! I'll catch you! - Tolik, are you alright? - Yes. Don't drop my child! We won't find a better spot! - That's right! - Lucky us! - Yep. - Comrade in a cap! - Huh? Excuse me, do you also smell that something's burning? I am losing my balance. Someone please help me! Thank you for helping me. Nikolai Bogdanov, city of Norilsk. - Heaps. - Soviet Union. - Yep. Perfect spot, captain. A comet will be in full view! A scope to the foredeck. Vasya! Vasya! Help me! I'm coming, Galya, I am. Captain... my telescope. Oh. Pardon me. That's how the pirate ship turned into a B&B. Now it's time to introduce my mistress. She's bred roses of phenomenal colour. Are you tired? No. Mr. Vasiliy, don't get distracted. - Vasya. - Oh. Be careful, my friend. This is a very delicate contraption. When I was young, I dreamt about a fire engine. Not anymore. Now I dream about the Newtonian reflector. ANO-454. We have one like this in my astronomy club. All done. We'll try to see it tonight. Over there. Is it a real comet? What else could that be? What if it's an alien spaceship? What can be done? I'll have to call the police. Another one has bloomed. That'd be awkward. What kind of guard would I be then? Such a pure colour! Galya, what should I do? Oh, Vasya, dear, sorry, I wasn't listening. Well, go to them and explain everything. They'll understand and go away. And that's what I'll do! I want for two weeks. - I want for a month. - A tenner, gimme a tenner. Give him back 3 roubles back. - I'll hand back change later. - All right, later then. ...millions of red roses... Just look at these tomatoes! Welcome! How are you? Do you eat well? Do you eat well? I do. Mr Vasiliy! Mr Vasiliy! Mr Vasiliy! - Good afternoon. - Oh! Welcome. How's life? How's your leg? Still hurt? Oh, I grin and bear it. You have a fantastic household! I didn't expect. Have you taught these birds to talk? They also sing. You don't say. Oh, they do! They do! - Get ready! - Hey-ho, hey-ho.. One more time! Another time! Melody's correct. A second. Thank you. Let's go. You know, as a child I also took an interest in zoology. How interesting. What a sophisticated lifestyle! Such a variety of interests! Leave the ship. We will leave it, we will leave alright. Yet it's a pity to say farewell to such a romantic haven. You're a sea person, a sea captain. Correct? Why aren't you at sea? Got sick. Lungs. Doctors ordered to move to the South. It's been 7 years that I've been treated and lived here. How unfortunate! It isn't fair! Is there any hope? The doctors promise. Why has he come? Oh, I see that motorboats are your hobby? A dream. Opportunities present themselves to make your dream come true. What opportunities? What's he implying? I don't understand anything. But you're a captain! You won't throw women and children off the ship! You're an honourable man! I get my rent and money for guarding the set. Do you get it? But I'm not talking you into anything immoral! What do I suggest? To break the ship, burn or dismantle it? No! To guard the ship! Day and night! Night and day! Don't say no to our company. And why? There's money? This isn't money, it's a part of your dream, a stern. By the end of the season you'll get the whole motorboat. - Take away your money! - I just want to help. Galya! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. You'll help me by clearing off the ship. Me and your husband were talking, dreaming. A motorboat is a good thing! Wind blowing in your face! A foamy trace behind the stern. Pardon me. Why a motorboat? I'll go and chase them from the ship at once! Please, don't get nervous. And while you're about it, buy some bread, please. Is this all we have? I'm getting my salary tomorrow. Well, one rouble - that's also money. Right, Galya? I understood that master Vasiliy felt sorry for those on the ship. But as a guard he had to ask them to clear off the ship. Mater Vasiliy, you're right! Right!! Where's everybody? A woman fainted! Help! Help! Thank you. You're a true modest hero. No-no, please take her by the legs, I'll take her by the arms. That's it. God! Water! Something to drink! Don't you think she's dying? No, not really. And yet? I don't feel well! Take your stuff. I'll tell about you in the newspapers. Comrades! Here, in front of you... - What's your name? - Simon. ...Simon! A real modest hero! He saw that an elderly lady didn't feel well and he gathered his forces to get up from his beach bed. Let's applaud! - Water! - Lady. Only you can do it. Two bottles of mineral water. I beg you. You can't say no. Thank you in advance. Here. Carefully. Look after my bag. Your belongings? Take them with you. Don't get burnt, baby. If you feel like swimming, your Dad will go with you. I'm busy. How can you? A natural disaster is near, and you ask me to swim. Gennadiy, do you hear what our child is saying? He says, natural disaster. Tolik is talking nonsense, pussycat. May I change my leg? Excuse me, were you talking about the comet? Of course. My boy is observing it with a real astronomer. They know everything: about where it's landing, about the danger... But they said on the radio that there's no danger... What would you expect, that they'd say: run for your life? Do you imagine what would happen to the tickets? So, it's dangerous? You bet! Come on! The comet is not dangerous. But is it really a comet? It's a spaceship. - They came to conquer us. - What? What nonsense! Stop it at once! You don't know anything, so be quiet. - Be quiet! - I am. I'm drowning! Help! Help! Help me! Don't worry. All's fine. Thank you. Listen, your face looks familiar. I think we've seen each other today, several times. No, we haven't. Are you cold? Don't touch me! Got it. So you're not cold. I need to go. Big deeds are ahead. If you'd like to see me, my address is the Flying Dutchman, upper deck. Good luck. Wait! This was almost scary! Where's the Flying Dutchman? Over there. - Do you work there? - As an astronomer. Stop joking and take me there, please. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? Ms. Elizabeth. This way, Your Highness. Again you're... Ouch! Queens loved this name. My name is Nicolas. Nice to meet you. Can I ask you a question? Who is the lucky one, who's got your royal attention? That's a secret. All the time secrets and mysteries. I don't like them. And me, I adore them! Excuse me, but your handwriting isn't legible, It's beautiful handwriting! Bukhara. The Flying Dutchman filming group. To the attention of the director Gevorkian. The situation is the worst possible. Romantics gain the upper hand. Don't worry. Mr Lumber from Epiphany. It's time for the ship to start a voyage for many days, for many years! For many days, for many years! This turned out to be the last quiet evening. ...the one I love and a stern will leave a trace. And a stern will leave a trace. - You know, Nicolas? - What? It sounds strange, but this is my first time at the seaside. I nearly drowned... from awe. Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Take your hand off me. Why? We barely know each other. I saved your life. And you take advantage. Alright. I am not cross. It feels good to be alive. What a huge star! It's Venus. Venus. Oh. You're an astronomer. I am a miner, an engineer. But in my free time I like to look through the scope. Would you like to look at the sky? It's very interesting, but I have things to do. Of state importance, Your Highness? I need to find Gevorkian. Ask the captain. By the way, here he comes. - Master Vassiliy, keep guard! - Yep. Here everything's in order. Well, let's inspect. Fire of the romantics. - Put it out. - Yessir! Hey guys! How many times do I have to tell you? Put it out! We didn't know, sorry. Comrade Captain! These are my business trip papers. I was dispatched here. ...is dispatched to the Flying Dutchmen film crew for scheduled maintenance. I see. I was told to look for Mr. Gevorkian. Mr. Gevorkian is not here. Did something happen? No one's here. They left. Comrade Heaps stands in for Gevorkian, don't you? I do. I need a place to sleep and tomorrow I will start... Noone's here. What kind of maintenance can there be? Everyone is in the desert, shooting there. But Fedot could not have left! Comrade Fedot left, I saw that. What am I to do? Go back. - Maybe I should join them? - Maybe. There's no connection with the desert. Go back home. Right now? Mr Georgiy. Please, provide accommodations until tomorrow. Mr. Vasiliy, there are no vacancies. Do find one. On the deck? - In the cabin. - Yessir. Don't be afraid. It's me, Tolik. Are you looking for a ghost too? What ghost? There's a ghost on this ship. During the day I looked in the keyhole. There wasn't anyone. But now it asks to be let out. - Do you know why? - No, I don't. To strangle us all! It's just your imagination. There's no one there. And who's scratching, then? Comrades, let us sleep. I haven't told my Mom, she'd die from fear. Tolik, where are you? - Oh, quiet! - Hush. Tuzik, look after the ship. We'll be back soon. They still haven't left! You know, Galya, sweetie, I haven't talked to them yet Maybe it's good that they're there? Otherwise I'd have to walk around it at night to chase away romantics. Not good for my health... I don't know. This isn't right. Yet, I feel sorry for all these people. Right you are. They have nowhere to go. Let's go. Imagine how surprised everyone will be by your tomatoes. You really think so, Vasya? Of course. No one in the world has managed to grow something like this. Okay. Weights are here. And what's your price for your beauties? Same as in the shop. Look at these tomatoes! Look at my grapes. It's all thanks to you. Thank you for your help. My science, but your work! - You can go to exhibitions with it. - Yep. - I'll try it. - Be my guest. Whoa, look at these tomatoes! It's a pity that doctors don't allow me. Take them, please. You'll get healthier from eating them. - You've grown them yourself? - I have. Thank you. - Vasya, you smoke again! - Yep. But you mustn't. Tobacco is poisonous! Is it? Do you want to die? From smoking one pipe? Mom, look, Lord Tomato from the Tale of Cipollino. How much are they? - One rouble. - I'll give you a discount. Mister's joking. Let's go. Mom, wait. Can it talk? Galya, let's give it as a present. Grow taller and play, little one! - Please don't. - Thank you. It's on the company. I'm begging you, stop smoking. I am not a baby, I know what to do. You've forgotten everything! Stop being so patronizing. I'm healthy again. I will smoke, from time to time. It brings me pleasure. Tobacco is poisonous! They look unnatural. - Maybe you've coloured them artificially? - Maybe. There are no such tomatoes in real life. Of course there aren't. Galya, sweetie, do you get it? They don't believe you. Who wants tomatoes for free? We don't need such tomatoes. Free tomatoes. Free tomatoes. Who wants tomatoes for free? Pardon me. They're real! Take them! Eat them! Or use them for seeds. I'm giving them away. Help yourself! You don't love me? If I hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed in this hole for all these years with you. Because of your illness I left everything behind. My friends, my work, the institute! - PhD Thesis! - It's not salty enough. You think only of yourself. Of course, I'm not perfect. I have my weaknesses. Everyone's on edge. Sorry, I won't anymore. This is how you've always hooked me. Foolish me, I've always thought that you need me. That I'll manage to help you get well. And you destroy yourself with your own hands! I won't support your weaknesses. Smoke if you want. I'm leaving. Weaknesses have nothing to do with it. Look, you've put too much salt in this soup. My care, my nerves, my life - all in vain! Stop her! I won't let you go! I cannot live without you! Can the comet collide with the Earth? Generally speaking, such events are extremely rare. But in this case science and all of us are somehow lucky. This particular comet... possibly... will crash into Earth's atmosphere. And we're quarrelling! And above the point with coordinates 43° N, 38° E it will cease to exist in the top layers of the atmosphere. Great. But that's where we are! Not precisely, but more or less... More or less, not precisely. So is it or is it not? More or less, yes. We suppose that the comet's core is a massive ice block with metal-containing rocks. How big are these rocks? If one of these rocks lands on the Earth, I hope it'll find its way into a museum. All right then. Everything is clear. It depends on the rock. A rock can be small, or it can be like the Tunguska one. - Right, young man? - Right. There are sometimes huge meteorites with huge rocks. They fall to the Earth, and they can fall here. Of course, you remember that comets were depicted on many engravings and other works of art. But we need to clarify and explain certain things. Tsunamis, earthquakes. They've always frightened people and caused heightened interest. Yes. See: This is a tsunami. And here we see a big ship breaking into small pieces because of a powerful tsunami. Interesting. Excuse me, young man. Is it possible to organize a collective viewing of the comet for the ill-informed, through your telescope? Not yet. It has to rise. Gennadiy, should we leave? We're overcrowded here anyway... I don't get it. What's wrong with this place? They won't allow comets to fall from the sky in Moscow! By the way, have you heard that near the Himalayas in some mysterious caves they have found absolutely naked people, who do not know how to use fire? - Everything's gonna burn. - We won't allow it. When this rock falls into the sea, the splashes will reach the clouds in the sky! Kaboom! Splash! Like that! I'll kill you! I'll stab you. Where's my child? - Where's my child? - I'll destroy you! I'll kill you! I'll stab you! Fedot. - I hate everything that's living. - I'm so glad! Tuzik, drop it! Half a year of our institute's work's gone. How was I to know that scarecrow was made in her institute? Galya. Go and have a look what are they doing to that scarecrow. There's no way we would be able to pay it off in our lifetime! It's all my fault. I rushed into action. I'll kill you! - Auntie Liza. - Yes. Does it rely on semiconductors? It's using liquid crystals. Help me. - Whoa! - Be patient, baby. - A horrible robot. - Awful. That's how they wanted it for the Flying Dutchman film. - Oh yes. - People invent the strangest things. Can he talk fluently? No, his software's limited... ...to misanthropy. Tolik, step away and sit up there. Leave him be. I hate everything living! I will annihilate! I'll stab you! - The comet! - I hate! Meet the comet! They say "in the vicinity," get it? Will it pass or will it fall? - No one knows! - Daddy, Dad. - Is the comet bigger than a melon? - It is. - Where it's going to fall? - Into the sea, I guess. This we don't know. It can crash into the shore, depending on its trajectory. How many comets have we seen in our life? This isn't the first one, sweetie, not the first. I still remember when they used to say 'It's the end of the world'. It's time for the ship to start a voyage for many days, for many years! for many days, for many years! I dream about the one I love, ...the one I love... ...the one I love... ...the one I love... and a stern will leave a trace. and a stern will leave a trace. Not so loud, not so forceful. Mind your diaphragm. ...will leave a trace... Much better! Good job, you learn fast. ...will leave a trace... Tuzik, good job. Just like Shalyapin. Master Vasiliy! Danger! Galya! Galya! Galya! To the rescue! Mr. Guriy, good afternoon! Good afternoon! You're back. For 2 hours only. I had to go to the bank, to get some money. And then I started to feel something in my bones. A premonition. What if it burned? It didn't. What can happen to it? And where's your husband? Wait for him. Let's go inside, have a cup of tea. I've made such tasty pastries, so fresh. I have no time. Mr. Guriy, have a look at my tomatoes. Remarkable. - You haven't seen anything like them. - It can wait. Heaps, there you are! Where are you going? Who? Me? You, you! Come here a moment! Yes, do come here. Good afternoon, Mr. Guriy! Good afternoon! Let's go. - How are you? - Perfect. How are things? How's the shooting? We shoot. Have you put a cannon over there? What cannon? - It's a telescope, Mr Guriy. - What for? To observe the comet. Haven't you heard? I hear about it day and night. Can you see it over there? We shoot it every night. So it will fall on you too? I wish it fell already. Until it does, we're stuck in the desert. The director's got one thing on his mind: what a view, we need to shoot. While I have deadlines! A timeline! Hey, why are you dancing in front of me? Step to the right, step to the left. - Who? Me? - You Mr. Guriy! Mr. Guriy! Mr. Guriy! I hoped then that Mr. Vasiliy wouldn't worry and, of course, that the producer didn't notice anything. You're a responsible guard. And the doggy's working. Thank you. My premonition was wrong. And that thing, put it on your roof. Surprisingly, everything worked out - You're tired a bit, right? - Right. Thank you, brothers. Thank you, Tuzik. My pleasure. It's our common cause. Kolya. Look at me. Don't disturb. Don't disturb. You see for yourself, I'm busy. Liza... I'm happy All the evidence goes to prove that it'll fall here. Liza! Liza! Elizabeth! Liza! Liza, please wait! Liza, I can't stop following the comet now. Liza, it's a fantastic thing! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! Liza, I think I'm discovering something! Okay, I'm a miner, I work underground. But I want to look at the sky! The sky! Liza, I won't let you go! I don't want to stand in your way! Without you I can't! I can't! Kolya, Liza! Look what I've accomplished. It pricks. Please, take it. - Thank you. - For good luck. How's everything, calm? And why is it calm? Mom, you've understood. Wire me 20 roubles. I'm flying out. Why 'why'? I can't wait anymore. Call Mr. Beridze. Ask what they think about this comet. Do you understand? Their opinion about the comet. It's not a romance. The comet will fall. No, not a "gal," it's gonna fall! I'm off to watch it. It's about to appear. Yep, soon. Don't worry, I'm protected. Well, thanks. I'd be in trouble without you. Well, I'm a mechanic. - Mr. Vasiliy! - They call me. Come join us! Our beloved Mr. Vasiliy! Our dear Mr. Vasiliy! Mr. Vasiliy, You are our mother hen, and we are your chicken. You protected us from the nasty claws of a wicked bird of prey, from fate! - Hooray! - Hooray! All thanks to Tuzik. Hooray for Tuzik! Mr. Vasiliy! To your health. Got it, got it. Colleague, you earned it. Pardon me. They say that the comet is going to fall right here. That's why everyone's leaving. Maybe we should also leave? It can start fires. Fires? We won't allow fires! We don't need any floods, earthquakes and eclipses. So what about the comet? Our friendship is stronger than any comet! We're not afraid of the comet! I think we should leave. Guys, let's be happy and have fun! Let's dance! Everyone on board! Let's go! - Come, come! - Wait. Liza, wait. By the way, I do synchronised swimming. I see. And I was rescuing you. That's great. Even though I myself could be saving you every day. It's breaking apart! False alarm, dear colleague. I started to think that we were about to make a groundbreaking discovery Please, continue with the music. What is happening? It's totally empty. Everyone, probably, is sailing away... while we're still here. Of course, it's time to leave. Tolik needs to get ready for school. I am to start work in a week. Decided, we're leaving. I am ready! - Gennadiy, is Tolik with you? - No. - I've got... - Tolik? No, a constructive suggestion. Tolik! You drive me crazy. I'll inform you of the whereabouts of your offspring. - You kidnapped my son! - See you. It was a pleasure to meet you. Will you take us into your car? Where's Tolik? Where's my son I'll call the police! Bad move! I'm ready! Okay. Intelligent people will always find their way toward mutual understanding. Albina, dear! Who taught you to kill your own mother? Who taught you to hide cowardly in a moment of danger? I'm not a coward! I'll stay with Kolya! We'll observe the comet together till the very last moment! Stop this empty talk! You want to make me a single mother? It was a pleasure to meet you. Reciprocally! They've dumped us. Wait! Gosha, dear, what are we to do? Hey! Wait! We're not going far, only to Kharkiv. You must understand that seats are limited. I don't need a seat. And she'll sit on my lap. We'll pay. You'd better take a bus. Hmm... Our ship turned empty. Miss, where's everybody? In an open-air theatre. Alla Pugacheva is singing. And some got frightened by the comet. You shouldn't laugh. I'm afraid that you and Tolik encouraged this panic. - You don't say. - I do. And in general, it's scary. Why aren't you scared of the moon? It may fall too. We're born and the moon's already there, while no one ever saw such a comet. Okay, they've explained everything on the TV. But I raise my head and see it. Kolya, it has a tail! What a tail! Creepy. And it's coming closer! - What if? - 'What if' what? Kolya, maybe we should leave too? How long do we have to wait? When will they clear it? Citizens, calm down. A dozer is on its way. It'll clear the rock - and off you go. We should have left earlier. Mom and Dad, goodbye. I spent a wonderful half a life with you. Don't look for me. Anatoliy. Me and master Vasiliy thought that everyone left the ship. No such luck! There you go. I knew it! Get into the car! Your father and I, we've been looking for you all over the city! Get into the car! Jesus! I'm gonna break this damn telescope! It took away my child from me! Mom, I warned you. Gennadiy! By the way, the lad's right. What did you say? Really, where are we going? Look at it, it's gonna fall on our heads! You were running away with me. Unfortunately, I've gotten used to obeying you. But that's enough! Dad, I like you. You've become a man! - Useless! - The road's blocked. It'll be blocked until morning. Let's sleep over on the ship! Our fine ship! It's not a hut, but a real vessel, that can sail! - But of course! - It sails. We have our own ship. - This is our salvation. - Salvation! Salvation! You're going crazy! Comrades. We don't need a ship to save ourselves. Nothing's going to happen. There will be no explosion. There will be no aliens. There won't be any tsunami even. All of it will happen! You won't trick us. You scientists... Listen, I want to know all the truth. I have a child! They don't know themselves. But we have to save ourselves. We do have a captain! Mr. Heaps! Mr. Vasiliy! Mr. Vasiliy! Mr. Vasiliy! What's happened? Mr. Vasiliy. Can this ship sail? It has to. But why? But if we launch it now, we'll drown. Won't we? I doubt it. Launch it? Why? To sail away. To sail away from the comet. What? Under no circumstances! What do you mean? You have to understand! You have to. There's no other way. Look at the sky! Leave the steamboat alone. If you're not doing it, I'll do it myself. They all've gone crazy there, do you understand? I need to go to the ship. Vasya, dear, don't worry. Don't worry. But I... I... I! I'm in charge of everything! Vasya, dear. Take a jacket. It'll be cold at night! I'll take it, I will! Stretch out your hands! So you don't want to go with me? A mutiny! No way! You're not going to get away with it! I'll make you. I won't leave you! Vasya, dear, you love me that much? Protect the men. Galya, he's right. Maybe it was worth it, those 20 years together. It was worth it to live to this moment. Hey you there, on the ground! More efforts, lads! A little bit harder! There, almost there! Once again! Harder! All together! One more time! And one more time! Gennadiy, sweetie, push. Guys, please, push it. Mr. Vasiliy, we're waiting for you. What are the orders? The sail's ready. Where should it go? We'll see, according to the circumstances. You haven't convinced them. Don't worry, they won't be able to push it off the shore. Whatever happens, I'm with you in it. This ship was put here by a crane. It weighs 50 tons! You won't be able to move it without a crane! - See. - Do something about it. Why are you standing still? Pussycat, I don't have a crane. Excuse me, how powerful is your car? 100 horsepower. So please help us. Let's push the logs. - With the car? - Of course. We have 4 cars. That's something! What's the matter? Hurry up, hey! To your cars! To your cars... To your cars... Comrades, don't! You'll break the ship! I'm in charge of it! Gennadiy, do it at once! The car's insured! Where are you, comrades? Mr. Vasiliy! I am being carried away! Tolik! Hey, you on the deck! Drop anchor! Drop what? Tolik! Tolik! Tolik, let down the rope ladders! Mom, hold onto me. - Mom, calm down. - The ship is out of control. Put up the sail! Yessir! Hooray! We're sailing! Hooray! There's water in the cargo hold! Mr. Vasiliy, we need to sail in a different direction! We're gonna crash against the rocks. Where are you taking us? To the shore. Before it's too late. We're gonna crash against the rocks! Let go! It hurts! What have you done? The steering wheel broke! We've hit rock-bottom. Look into the sky! That's it. That was terrifying. Terrific. Such a huge comet! Where has it gone? Gennadiy, I was silly. All this is my fault. Don't worry. Who can swim? - Me. - A little bit. Not too good. I see. Then no swimming 'til the morning. Dad, I'll come over next to you. You come closer too. Otherwise you'll catch cold. I'll have a nap. I didn't bring my teapot anyway. Why did we hurry? Why did we get frightened? What will happen tomorrow? Kolya, it didn't get crushed at all. Yes. Mrs. Galina, we've come to see you. Are you from there? It's a bit awkward. Everyone thought we were a comet, and ran away. It's our fault. Yes, you did mess things up. Mrs. Galina, we've heard about a deed of a geneticist who, by force of circumstances, without tools and assistants, without academic consultants, managed to fulfil her dream. Comrades, how come? The whole world believes that you're a comet, I am glued to my telescope, and all the while it's you! Young man, do understand, dreams rule this Galaxy. Without courageous endeavours, progress is unthinkable. Kolya, really. Colleagues from space haven't flown here for fun. Where is your famous greenhouse, that object of worship for every thinking mind in the Galaxy? Please, follow me. You're right. All these fruits that you see here I was able to grow by believing in a dream. While blue roses can reconcile lovers for the same reason. This is my husband Vasiliy. We're in love with each other, as we were 20 years ago. I am asking, who dared to do this? Who? I am asking a question here! Who dared to divide the ship? These halves have to be together! Together! The ship... Who did that? It's my fault. Have I asked to divide the ship? Please, answer, citizen Heaps. Listen, could you stop that noise? My child's sleeping. While comrade Heaps saved his life. I can repeat this in any court or any other place! - Yes! - Marisha, tell him. I confirm. And you, Mr. Lumber from Epiphany? I put my hopes into you! It just happened. Get to the shore immediately! At once! We won't give him to anyone. Right, Dad? Good job. Whoa... This isn't my fault. The pirate ship crashes into the rocks! - This is the ending of our film! - It is! So let's shoot. Get rid of all those strangers. Comrades, strangers, please be so kind, if it's not a problem for you, please swim over here. Swim! We're not strangers. This is how the story ended. First each was on their own and now all are together. Humans are totally different from dogs. Fantastic. Get ready to shoot. Script: Kir Bulychev, Richard Viktorov with the participation of Yuriy Chulyukin Directed by Richard Viktorov We are given so much: a crimson ray of dawn, a window facing an autumn orchard, but this is not enough for us we are attracted by the big world tempestuous and endless We're following our dream, we follow an eternal path We follow earthly roads towards a distant familiar light and later we will pass on our dream to others And if in that moment the shining will not dim the world will be magnificent and immortal
