The Slovak Film Institute presents Retreat! Who's in command now? Bacher and Grothe are dead, Hoferik is in charge. - Corporal Hoferik? - Yes. At my orders... Bayonets at the ready! That's insane! I said - bayonets! Stop screaming, for God's sake! Get over here! Damn, you need help? Forward! Christ, the man's lost his mind! Forward! They got it! Half of our men fell. Why didn't you stay with the horses? - You said - bayonets! - You idiot! What was that for? So we wouldn't all die, so that reinforcements could take over. So that we could roll around behind the frontline and wait to stuff ourselves at the regimental feast! Fools, you should be grateful! Retreat and clear the regiment's positions! That's an order! I'll cover you. Horak, take care of the horses! They're your responsibility, you hear me? Or you'll be a head shorter! Have they all retreated? Only the dead remain. Wish I had a cigarette... Why send us kids like these? Who knows if he'd ever had a woman. Do you want a woman after a fight like this? I do. It's as if the fear went straight to my balls. Fear? - Then why do you do it? - It's my duty. And this one over here? He was doing his duty too. Bullshit! He only followed your orders! Just like the rest who got torn to pieces. For no purpose! Just get it out of your system. For some, it hits their balls, others are hit in the head. What for? You and your duty... You bastard! Starring Vlado Müller in the film SIGNUM LAUDIS Written by: Director of photography: Directed by: Nothing's wrong with you, you're not leaking anything. There now... See to the horses somebody, damn it! I report orders carried out! I attacked and captured the enemy's post and held our position until 13:00 hours. Number of dead... Very well, Corporal, you can go. It's all right now. Have a drink, it'll do you good. Better come back without a leg than not at all. Johnny... What if it's Bayer in the first grave and Horaéek here? A dead man doesn't know shit. And after the war? When their mothers come here? I'd be pretty pissed to have a stranger pray at my grave. And I'd be damn pissed if I were to lie here. And no dirty stories tomorrow! You ballerina. I'll assign you to the latrines for a week! This better be dry by morning! That guy was spawned by war, I swear. I hope I was dreaming. Yes, Corporal. Dry by morning. Your leg. The other one! No party for you tomorrow, not even a beer! If you wonder why, take a look at his left hind leg. As I said! What's that? It's all that's left of the boys you sent into that attack. You'll never be more than a stupid coachman. I beg to report... Well, Hoferik? Everything's ready for tomorrow's celebrations. You'll see to it that nobody gets drunk before lunch time. Rest assured, Sir. Dismissed! A good soldier, isn't he? With all the officers dead, a Corporal 's in charge. I often get the feeling that the Emperor has no idea what's going on in the army. Maybe things will get better now. Franz, brandy! What is it? Guess who was named Chief of Staff? Old Gross, who else? General Berger. The one who had his aide shot? Write a message: To General Friedrich Berger, My sincere congratulations. Signed Rudolf Ziegler, Commander, etc. You know Berger well. Better than you think. You were in his class at cadet school, right? Don't send the message. The general will be after me like a dog. Sorry, gentlemen. This is how I lost prima ballerina Peckova. - Who was the lucky guy? - A stoker from Bolshoy. A fantastic player. I wish there weren't this tension between the two of us. They named me Chief of Staff instead of you only for political reasons. The Imperial Court wishes to eliminate the conflicts between the German and the Austrian High Command. And my wife is the niece of the German Chief of Staff. The Austrian army should be under Austrian command! This would be an interesting discussion at the War Academy. Today, it's time for fighting. I hope we'll have the opportunity. May I deal, gentlemen? I give you half a litre for each. We're in need. People reap what they didn't sow. You'll hardly find even a swallow in the cow sheds. The fields are barren, so are our women. Six deci-litres for one, then. God is my witness I can't give you more. Have a drink, your heart will be glad. Three quarters of a litre for each! Drink up, we'll strike a deal after. God knows we will. Who's in there? Must be a roaming cat. Have a drink, you'll feel better. That's my son's wife. Your husband is at the front? That was the Lord's will. You're very pretty. Pour me a drink. Open up! Are you staying for the night? No. Are you afraid of me? No. Seven decilitres for one, that's all I can give. My son will need money to start over. Will you come tomorrow? You see, I... Don't speak... Nothing's true in war. Three quarters of a litre for one. And allow me, General, to congratulate you on your promotion. Thank you. My adjutant, Lieutenant Kosztolanyi. Sergeant Major Wimmer, KronenZeitung correspondent. Gentlemen, please... A toast... To your brave soldiers! I'm happy to make your acquaintance. I've received the best references about you. I read the Oberstleutenant's report, describing in such elegant language why his regiment is almost all gone. Dead, wounded, captured... Exhaustion, disease... And not a word on the two companies that deserted! - General, if I may... - No, you may not! They deserted and that's that. Most of my regiment are Czechs and the companies you mentioned... Desertion means there is something wrong with morale and discipline. It means defeatist and Panslavic sentiments. Morale and discipline depend on the commanding officers! I agree with you, General. In a situation such we're in, in the middle of a war, we must fight the decline of morale and discipline by all possible means. By courts martial and by medals, too. Colonel Reznitzek, please! General Berger has decided to present the Medal of Honour, in the name of the Emperor, to Corporal Hoferik from your regiment for exemplary bravery in battle against the hated enemy. Hoferik? The Signum Laudis medal is only for senior officers. Times have changed. But your astonishment doesn't surprise me. His Highness the Emperor appears to know your soldiers better than you do. Hand over the liquor! Is that you, Captain? Who else would recognise you by smell? Come over here! I'm off to pick up some machine-guns. One bottle for the trip there and another for the trip back. That makes three. Three? We'll drink one now, you and me, because you're my supplier and my friend. Sit! Can you drink like a real trooper? Do you love me? On your order, Captain! No orders. No Captain. Bruno! I'm only a Corporal. Corporal or not, Bruno! Let's drink! Open another bottle. Corporal is the worst rank of all. The men are afraid of me and the officers don't give a damn. You mean, they don't give a shit! But you, Captain, I like! Bruno! All right, Bruno. - What's your name? - Adalbert. Here's to you, Bert! Captain... Bruno... How much can you take? The truth. A bottle a day. I've been with the regiment three and a half years. So that's - how many bottles? 1,277. That's good maths! I used to be a horse-dealer, see. That's a good business. Except for the trouble I get into. But when the war is over, there won't be any horses. Business is best when there isn't anything! Let's do it together. I'm a Doctor of Law, I'll represent you. And I'll get you out of any trouble. That would be something! - How many per cent would I get? - Five? You're poor because you're skimpy. You give me fifty per cent - happily! I'm a great lawyer. I handled half of the divorces in Prague. You'll get it all back tenfold! Give me an example of the trouble you got into. I bought a mare that was barren and I knew it and still sold her as a breeder. And they found out. What did the court say? Return the money, pay a hefty fine, and I lost my licence for a year. If you'd had me, they'd pay you damages! - What would you have told them? - What would I have told them? I'll show you. First, I'd bribe the witnesses. Then I'd deliver my speech - Your Honour! It is beyond all doubt that if we take the Hoferik case as a precedent, without veering between the relevant and the irrelevant, we shall arrive at the conclusion that my client, tradesman, Corporal Hoferik, perpetrated no crime whatsoever quite the contrary. That's what I'd say. I'll let you have your fifty per cent. - But what about evidence? - There is none. The less evidence the better. Please... Not bad for field conditions. Who owned this place? Count Vishnievsky, I think. No! In that case it's possible that... On one of his estates my father made the acquaintance of Countess Varvara Grigorievna, my mother. Are you half Russian? Well, General... My mother was half French, her father half Polish, half Russian, and my father had Italian blood... Europe is quite small, found room in all our beds. Lieutenant Colonel! You haven't introduced us yet and I'd like to meet that Corporal... Hoferik! I'll bring him to you. Cut it out! If you've told on me and got me into trouble... I should have shot you! I never learn. What good are you?! Others feed me, anyway! All my life! General, if I may introduce to you - Corporal Hoferik, Sir. I beg to report, General... Excellency... Corporal Adalbert Hoferik of the 4th... That's enough. Gentlemen, take a look at our hero. Please let me tell you about my first prisoner. He was in charge of the cellars in Champagne. The next morning we couldn't tell who was whose captive, because he was wearing my hat, and I his. But when we discovered that I was in bed with his wife, it became obvious. I'm the winner! - Would you prefer some brandy, man? - No, I want this. And I'm not your “man"! Here's to your great deed! Now tell us all about it! We mean your counter-attack at point 126. I had orders to hold our position until thirteen hours. But the Russian artillery... launched an attack. So I shouted: Bayonets! and that was it. That's the kind of speech I like. Clear and comprehensive, no embellishments. What was running through your mind? There's not much thinking done, there's no time for that. Sergeant - Major Wimmer is war correspondent to the Kronen Zeitung. He came here to see you, he wants to write an article about you. Emphasise excellent morale in battle, and superior discipline. Write that I have witnessed it myself, under enemy fire. After all, it's not that far away. Rest assured, Excellency. And I want you to report directly to me once we bring the war to a victorious end. I have a country estate and I need a reliable steward. I believe in rewarding those who have shown their absolute loyalty. I shall quote your words, Excellency. The General deserves your gratitude, Corporal, for such an offer. Thank you, General... Excellency. I am to convey greetings from General Berger's wife. This reminds me, did you know Madame Elvira is blonde now? There are some things that officers do not discuss. Here's to your principles! How long have you been with the regiment? I joined two years before the war. I volunteered. Business was bad. I was a horse and cattle dealer. I might go back to that one day, if the steward job doesn't work out. But no more small-time bargaining. I'd go wholesale, and have my own lawyer. History will judge what's good and what's bad. I only care about the present. Your lives will always be decided for you by politicians who build on things that don't exist. That's life. I'm afraid I don't understand you. I'll put it simply like a newspaper headline. Uniforms are going out of fashion. Of course, I always exaggerate... Fill it up, or I'll kick your ass! I think that the Baron - he would manage well anywhere. And he'd be the pride of any society. You're wrong! Can you possibly see me as a Franciscan monk? He fulfilled the greatest goal, the highest ideal and most noble mission of our lives - heroism and devotion to our country and to His Majesty the Emperor. This sucks, my friend. Now you have to be brave always, until the day you die. I'm going to write five chapters. There have to be thoughts of the Emperor, and of final victory, that sort of thing. You haven't even asked what happened! No worries, Corporal. I've been on this job long enough. We're yet to turn you into a great hero. But you have to make a decision - horse dealer or hero? See you later. What does Signum Laudis even mean? “Sign of Praise.“ Something must be changing. Never before - an ordinary Corporal... Maybe it's because we now have the right to vote. You're an idiot! I don't want you to say that it went to my head. Have some! Don't worry, I can't be any worse. Drink up, men! Don't be shy. And you stop that squealing. I know... I never had so many friends before. I used to stay at inns and market places... But now Mr. Lawyer, our Captain, wants to join me and do business together. I'm not sure what I'll do. Maybe I'll work as a steward of a country estate. We'll see. People like me because I believe in order. I guess I'll take the steward job. All those horses... I'll breed only horses - that'll be the best deal after the war. The dead horses, that's what I hate most about this war. Horses in war should be prohibited. Then again, there's always plenty of business with the Army. I think I'll go and work as a steward. I'll buy a fur coat... And I'll be drinking champagne after dinner. Navrétil, bring out the horses! All the horses out! Doctor! We need a doctor! Where's Captain König? He said he'd be right back. - Have him come to see me at once! - Yes, Sir! Cover him up. Hold the attack line on road A 7! Fenrich, Kott and Hass request reinforcements and more artillery. The ones we sent didn't arrive. Do you hear me? Hold the attack line at A 7! General... - Do we have a connection to my Staff'? - Not now, but two men are at the wires. Fenrich, Kott and Hass have surrendered, General. What does that mean for us? That we're surrounded. Hedwiga! Stop! Down! You think it's that simple! You could hide in a cellar and then climb out and give yourself up? That's what your mates did, is that right? You'd better stay. We have some accounts to settle. What are your orders, Sir? Go to the carts and make two ready for the staff officers. Move it! Take a few men and go ahead to clear the way. Where do you think you're going with the cart? It's going to be difficult on the road, General. The fifth unit is already fighting and the Russians are within firing range. But I have an idea, General, if I may. The Russians only want the road. If we took it through the woods... I can depend on my men. I think we can slip through. Your Staff advises retreating to the second reserve line. That's a good ten kilometres! It's much closer across the woods. Pallawski must fight his way down the road and we'll ride through the woods with a small unit. Do you have a clear plan? If they control the road not all the saints together can help us. I'll return to the regiment as soon as I can. Good luck, Hans. We should've taken three units. This is not a military parade. This way the Russians won't find us and we can wait out the fight in safety. Yes, wait and leave our regiment to be massacred! Lieutenant - Colonel! General, I ask for permission to return to my troops. They're no longer yours! You stay where you are and follow my orders! It helps to know that the General trusts that the Russians won't discover us. What do you suggest, Corporal? The General is right. They won't find us. We'll stick it out for a day and a night, then we'll join the regiment. We'll set up guards but they must refrain from firing their guns. And don't set any fires. We'll have to shoot the horses - they would give us away if they get wind of the Russians. Kill the horses? How do we go on without them? We'll have to walk. - How far? - About six kilometres. Corporal, do all this as if these were my orders. We've been given a noble task: to get the Chief of Staff and his officers to safety. This is our chance to show courage and devotion to your Emperor. Konopasek, Steiner, Kostka, and Lorisch - you stand guard. I'm going to check on you. Pirkenbaum and Richter - follow me! Why did you knock the gun from my hands? You wanted to be court-martialled? I'd have all Corporals beaten up! - How old is your boy? - Eleven. This war will end. And by the time the new cannon fodder grows up, the next war will be ready to begin. By then your son will be the right age to be a Corporal. That sounds very nice. Corporal Steiner... Only an idiot like you could ever think that anyone could wage war again after all this horror here. Tie up their front legs. There's a bat we use for pegs, in one of the carts, bring it to me. Yes, sir! I said, bring the bat! Why don't you give me a real task? Send me out to reconnoitre maybe. I want to be a good soldier. Wanting isn't enough. One is born to be a good soldier. I want to be like you. They gave you the Emperor's medal. And you're the best soldier in the regiment. There is no regiment any more. The shooting 's over but that doesn't mean... You know very well what it means! The regiment fell because your senseless command left it without command! Your duty to me... My duty is to the Emperor! - Lieutenant - Colonel, your gun! - You'll have to take it from me. Damn it... I said hold your fire! I approve of his behaviour, gentlemen. Give me a break! Where are the others? In the forest, Captain. - What meeting is this? - Bruno, what are you doing here? I barely know. Where's Ziegler? I have to report to him. That's him on the ground... He realized that the orders he gave his regiment caused its destruction. This is how he faced the facts. He always was too much of a soldier. He had his honour. I would have it too but somehow it's growing old together with me. Well, we're all headed that way. Perhaps you're unaware that we're surrounded, Captain. In that case, let's first have dinner and then we'll surrender. Should this idea embarrass you, I'll hand out the machine guns. I got thirty-five of them. Russian captivity is different than, say, the French. Give the Lieutenant - Colonel a fitting burial. And I forbid any defeatist talk! Tomorrow we'll move on to join our lines. Move on? You're going to crawl on the ground too, General? I need a cigarette. Nobody knows how hard that was. Even my red horse... This fucking world! But there was no other way. But, I'm a Corporal... so it's all up to me now. Just talk... Now you're the one hit in the head. You bastard! Why didn't you just leave me there? Why did you save me? Just forget about it. A soldier is a soldier, as long as he's capable of fighting. The Emperor needs men. You don't owe me anything. You wanted to shoot me! This is your last chance, you wimp! What's all this for? You know the war is lost. Quiet! Get back! Go and help him! Run to the left, towards the marshes! Quick! Move it, damn you, I want to be out of this shit before dark! Move it! What the hell is wrong with you? - What's the point? - You want to kick off here? It's like a duck shoot! Shut the hell up! - We should go back. - I said I'd get you over. - But we're going in the opposite direction. - Talking won't help us now. Let's go! It's empty, we can spend the night there. Stop it, it's us! Where are you going? Are you crossing over? You coming with us? Or do you want to keep fighting, even if there's no one to fight against? I want to get home, not into captivity. Good thing you know who gets you where. Bruno, we have a deal, don't we? About our future business... That's all gone to hell, Corporal. Don't worry, we'll get out of this. Bullshit! - How about a shot of liquor? - No! Listen... Adalbert, is it? Wouldn't we have a better chance, just the two of us? No... I made a promise that I'll lead His Excellency to safety. Right. Get up! It's not all that tragic, gentlemen, the Corporal has booze! Cut it out, Bruno! Prince Hohensfeld has a similar lodge in Tyrol. It was famous for its picnics. Stop it, gentlemen. This is not the time for jokes. - So what do you suggest? - What is Corporal Hoferik's suggestion? Well, where are they? Have any of you seen them? Get up and clean your guns! Quickly! Enough of the pestering... I said - clean your guns! Three men deserted, General. Is that the way to report? Corporal Hoferik! I wish to report that three men deserted during the night. We won't deal with that now. What's the situation? We'll wait until dark, then we cross the front line. Like yesterday? I know where we are and where to go - What are we going to eat? - We'll have to go hungry today. - Which direction is the estate? - North-east, Sir. - How far to our lines? - Ten to twelve kilometres. We're further away than yesterday? You mean to lead us like that today too? I'll show the way. I know my duty - to you, to the Emperor, and to my country. You may go, Corporal. Dismissed! I suggest to change accommodation. The Russians' vodka is excellent and the Tsar's officers are gentlemen. Meaning - we should surrender. You're thinking the same thing anyway. What about the Corporal? He's ready to spur us on in front of him at bayonet-point. He is what you made him. You've painted him in your own image. So we'll erase him. What about his medal? He's only a horse dealer... What do you have in mind? Court martial. And the evidence? None. The less evidence the better. We can't let them corrode. Corporal, you are under arrest! Let's start. Having considered the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, General Berger, Oberstleutnant Rezniczek, Lieutenant Kosztolany, this Court, in accordance with Martial Law, rules that Corporal Adalbert Hoferik is found guilty of all charges: he caused the death of General Gross and more troops by deliberately and intentionally leading the Chief of Staff and his officers into a hopeless situation. He is sentenced, by Court Martial, without any option to appeal this decision, to the loss of all military distinctions and to death by shooting to be executed immediately. Do it now! Do you want to be blind-folded? Bruno... Captain... I'm innocent... Hang on in there and shut up. But why? Go away! You must be brave. But you need me. It doesn't matter. - You don't know the way! - Yes we do. Do you have a last wish? - Give me back my medal. - What do you care about that for? - The Emperor gave it to me. - So what? Do you believe in anything, you bastards? You will command the execution squad. - But I... - I said - it will be you. You may write about this some day, and you'll know what to say. I command you! Or you think that Captain König wouldn't put on one more performance? Load your guns! Ready! Hedwiga! Down! Fire! Fight your way westward. We'll try south-west. The unit to reach our lines first will provide cover for the other unit. Hope is in command. Good luck! Follow me! Hope can't get them through. He's a rookie, he has no experience. On the contrary - he's the ideal commander. Under the circumstances. This way! I said, follow me! Hold your fire! No witness is the best witness. Do you know the direction, Mister Correspondent? I always know the direction. This way.
