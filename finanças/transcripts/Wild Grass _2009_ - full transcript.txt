She didn't have ordinary feet So she went places she wouldn't go. if she had ordinary feet. Unable to buy shoes just anywhere from just anyone, she went to a shoemaker in Paris, located at... I forget the name now. It was on a street near some pillars. It's still there. The incident occurred as she left the shop. What incident? nothing significant or really important. A perfectly ordinary incident, something commonplace. But sometimes the commonplace, the ordinary... can lead to... to what? That's what we'll see. It was a beautiful day. The sky was blue. A winter sun. And she was in Paris to buy shoes. She hoped to see the shop attendant she liked whose touch gave her a vague feeling of pleasure. Choosing, trying... That took time. A matter of colour, model, sizes that never match. It's always like this, if you want things to match up you have to accept, however reluctantly to renounce, yield and compromise in the end, she picked a pair very close to what she wanted, of similar colour and which above all, fitted like a glove. Goodbye. She nearly cried out. How about that? What did she nearly cry? "Stop thief! Stop him?" She thought of it, you know. Everyone does in such cases. if you drown, you cry out, "Help! I'm drowning! Save me!" It's ridiculous, but do we have much choice? No! We don't even have time to find words of love ridiculous. We cry out "Help! Murder!" In fact, the words get stuck. We don't dare to. We die too scared to call out. The true terror is silent. Mouth agape. In short, she didn't dare. She needed money, but she had none left. She had her shoes. She decided to return them. She went back in the shop. She explained what had happened, they understood: it happens. She asked for a refund. She also said she'd come back for the shoes. Then she thanked them said goodbye and left returned home and ran herself an ice-cold bath. It was too cold. she added hot water thinking, telling herself... The police station can wait. There are hundreds of thefts every day. Besides, did I really need shoes? No, not really. Well, yes, I did. No. No I didn't need shoes. It's my fault. It was a whim, like that. A treat, the way people buy records, just to... Come on, calm down. You must declare the theft of... your papers, your checkbook, your credit cards... I have to call the bank. I'll do all that tomorrow. It's bound to stop in the end, it's exhausted. Just like me. Why don't we stop? I need a new battery. Certainly. I'm used to it. Let me do it. Thank you. She'll mess up the date indicator. - What do I owe you? - 15 Euros That's how it began. It might not have begun. He first picked up the wallet. Name: Muir First name: Marguerite. Distinguishing features: None Address: 8, rue des Ecoles, Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine A serious looking face... a little despondent... sad even... you could say sad, a hint of sadness. But it was only a photo, so, sad at that moment. Her Pilot's License photo was so different, it can't be the same woman. It is though. It's the same name, the same address. In this photo she's smiling. A headband, glasses on her forehead, as a joke no doubt. So she likes to joke. All right. She's a woman, sad more often than not, with an odd name, who flies a plane for fun. What can I do with this? What terrible taste! Everything is excusable. Not, everything, not bad taste. Suddenly, he wanted to touch her. Then, with a surge of emotion, he felt like strangling her, to set her straight, then and there. The other one too. Bump both of them off... Bump them off? Yes! Rid them of the taste.. The bad taste for provoking me. Just a second. What on earth are you thinking? Thinking about that again? Stop it right now! Stop thinking about it, please! There, calm down, Georges pal. You know what it has cost you in the past. So calm down, all right? What will I do with her? I have her name, address, and so her number, if she has a phone... of course she has. Everybody has a phone. No, not the poor. There are a lot of them. She isn't poor: flying costs a lot. Even so, she'll need to be in the phone book. I can call her and say... Let's see... say to her... Well... My name is Georges Palet. Have you lost something? You have. What? A wallet. And? No, not that. Say... I know... My name is Georges Palet. Have you lost something? You have? Hello, I'd like to... or may I, or could I, or could I possibly... or rather, Could I talk to Marguerite Muir? No... to Miss Muir. To Miss Marguerite Muir! So say to her... I know... No, I don't know. I want to talk to Miss Muir. Speaking? Well, hello, Miss. Madam? That's what I feared. What? Nothing. "Who are you?" Well my name is... No spare her the name. Just tell her... I'm calling you because... Because what? "Who is this?" Georges had come back to call. He no longer had the right to leave. He had no rights. He couldn't even vote but he didn't mind that. What he did mind... No, nothing. He didn't mind at all. Well, yes, what he did mind... No, lets not even think about it, if possible. If only he could have forgotten it. He wished he could. He'd waited his whole life to stop thinking at, last about anything. And that's what he expected. Thinking of her, would have been like thinking of nothing. It's her, my god, it's her! You're dreaming, pal. It can't be her. You fool, she doesn't even know you. For her, you don't even exist. I've been trying to reach you for an hour now! I doubt it, I'm just starting. Starting what? Go on. Starting What? Calling. Calling whom? The woman with the wallet. What woman? What wallet? What are you talking about? I don't know yet. Why did you call? Something wrong? Don't you feel well? Want me to come? I'm busy, but if you aren't well, I'll come. There's no need. Why did you call? Tell me first. No you first. No, you! What woman? What wallet? I'll explain. No, no, explain now. You sound odd. - Me, odd? - Yes. - What's happening? - Nothing. I went to change my watch battery and found a wallet. I'm trying to call the girl. She must be worried. It's needling me, see. I need to reassure her. But it hasn't been an hour yet. So, why did you call? About the lawn. What about the lawn? The children are coming on Sunday. I didn't know. I'd like you to mow the lawn. Anybody there? Anybody there? What are you doing? I called out. Back to the other side, please. What's it about? Could you close the door? We can't hear each other. Are you injured? Were you attacked? To steal my wallet? For example. So, were you attacked? No, I dislocated my shoulder trying to get my mower started. Electric, electric, that's the best. A wire, a plug... No nasty smells, no noise. Yes, but people have been electrocuted. They run over the wire and boom, or so I've heard. Perhaps, but I was only saying. Yes. yes. Anyhow, why are you here? Bernard, are you coming or not, damn it? Well? A celebration? A promotion. I'll be going. No, stay! What were you here for? Yes, I was here for... Could you close the door, please? Just a minute. So? You were here for? What's going on? Why did you leave like that? You turn up, you leave... What's going on? Come on now! Come with me. - Look at me. You came for a reason? - Yes. So tell me all about it. - Something to drink? - No, thank you. All right. I'm listening. Actually, I've found a wallet. You have it here? Of course but you know... - What? - Nothing. Here it is. Where did you find it? In the shopping centre car park. - Any money in it? - No. No, in that photo, it's true... But look at the other. There's that too? look. - She looks like Helene Boucher. - Who? An aviatrix from the thirties. Paris-Saigon solo, seven world records fatally injured during a training flight. You know your stuff. I read about her as a boy. Leave me your phone number and address just in case. - There may be a reward. - A reward? What reward? For the... Are you going to let her know? Tonight? Tonight it's a little late. What's your name? Palet. Georges Palet. P-A-L-E-T. Palet. Georges. Your address? He recognized me, I can see he has. It'll come back to him. What do I do? Kill him? And what's your phone number? Thank you for doing the lawn. If that's all it takes to make you happy. Something wrong? The wallet... Did you take it in? Yes but I'm worried. I wanted to reassure her myself. Wouldn't you worry if you lost all your papers? You bet. But what can you do? You took it to the police. Did it go well? Why? No reason. They'll let her know. Don't worry. Yes, but after how long? How long will it take? I'd have let her know right away. You Know? Yes. One point in my favor. It's ridiculous to wait. So try again. Calling someone? Yes, that woman. This late? - How do I look? - Very nice. - Sure? Not too much make-up? - No, you look lovely. Put the meat on. They'll be here soon. - It has to get going. - Put it on anyway. Fine but it won't cook. - Do you think Elodie is happy? - Yes, she is. They have two children: she isn't unhappy with him. Then again, with her, you never can tell. I find Elodie's husband very kind. A decent guy. - Look, they're here! - I saw them. Sweetheart! Are you well? - Yes. How's boxing? Training for the Championship. Something to drink? - We could use "tu" now. - I'd rather not, if you don't mind. - Do you mind? - No I was just asking. Use "tu" to say what? We're fine like this aren't we? Something to drink? Ready for seconds? Mum, wasn't Marcellin supposed to come? We're expecting him. No, we won't wait. - He'll be here soon. - With him you never can tell. Training for the championship. Nice. What were you discussing with my father? I like him when he's trying to be friendly. But, no... My father's like that. Aren't you dad? Mum, wasn't Marcellin, supposed to come? - You know how it is with him... It's nice to have a garden. Hi, everybody. I'll get it. Hello? May I speak to Georges Palet? Dad, it's for you. - Who is it? - Some lady. - She didn't give her name? - She asked for Mr. Palet - That's you, right? - Yes, you fool, or you wouldn't be Marcellin Palet. Nothing to be proud of. - Hello. - ?Yes? - I'm listening. - Actually... I'm calling because Because what? To thank you. What for? Just a second... Didn't you find my wallet? Yes. All right then, thank you. - Is that all? - What else? - I don't know. You could... - I could what? I don't know... - Feel like meeting me. - What for? I don't see any need to. I'm not surprised. - What? - I'm not surprised. - Listen - No I won't listen. You disappoint me. What's wrong with Dad? He's... I don't know, what could be wrong with him? He should take up a sport. Near the tennis courts, george realized he was perhaps doing something stupid. Something not quite right. Come down to the club one day. To see a fight. If you're interested. My father's like that. Aren't you dad? I wanted to tell you that I'm ashamed of the way I acted over the phone. let's see where she lives. I wanted to tell you that I'm ashamed of the way I acted over the phone. So ashamed I fell ill on a Sunday. Suzanne had to send for a Sunday doctor at the Sunday rate. I can't tell her that. I'ts not possible. She mustn't read it. I don't want her to read it. What on earth are you doing? You'll break it my boy. Who are you anyway? What are you doing here? - I've never been here before and... - And what? And I've never done this before, but I must get my letter back. Can you help? My dear fellow, even if I wanted to, I cant. Is it serious? Serious? No, what is serious? no it's not serious. I'd prefer... that she didn't read it. It is serious then. - Do you know her? - By sight. What's she like? I mean... in real life? Don't you talk? Hello now and then If you see her, could you tell her... You have a letter, from a gentleman. - What gentleman? - He didn't say his name. No, he just said that he forbade you to read it. - Fancy, and why? - I don't Know. - Give it to me. - Are you joking? - I have to tear it up - It's mine. She didn't add "now". But she thought of it. She read it. She didn't die of it. One doesn't die of that. Reading never killed anyone. It helps you live. She replied. She replied very kindly. A couple of words, three lines, a quarter page... "I consider the matter closed "everyone makes mistakes "its part of our lot "to get ideas". It needed more than that to discourage old Georges. He kept writing about what he believed his life to be. He ended up believing it. No, he believed it. He wrote it, so he believed it. One has to believe to write. And it's so real one ends up believing. "I don't know if I've already told you... yes, I have already told you. I've already spoken about my old passion for flying. I shared that with my father. He dreamed of being a pilot but ended up a motorcycle mechanic. Motorcycles don't fly. We buried my father a week ago. I wonder what I can talk about. My mother is threatening suicide. I don't dare ca... She read his words but didn't reply. Two messages. First Message. It's Josepha. The prosthodontist called. he won't be ready tomorrow. He's sorry. Take care. It's me again. You're never home. I wanted to talk to you... about everything and nothing. Not about nothing. As if we were having a drink. Georges called every evening. She was never home. The machine always answered. Answering machines do that. I heard my father saying that my mother tried to kill herself. I went to the hospital where I was born. When I came over she said "spare me that look. You'd never have the guts". I call that a desire for murder. Don't you? well, I must dash. I have to put the ravioli on. No more messages One evening, he surprised her. He caught her without her machine on. She was there, in person, for once. - Hello? - Oh. it's you... I'm very glad to speak to you - Because... - Because what? I;m asking you, begging you, not to write to me, to leave me alone. - Leave me in peace. - No, that's impossible. Am I at peace? Not since I got to know you. Why refuse to see me? It won't ki... eat you! I wanted to make you stay. To delay you, talk to you. I couldn't find a better way. You know, I'm not an evil man. When I realized what I'd done, I panicked. I'm running away. But first... I want you to know that I'm the one who slashed you. No! The one who did this to you. She had made up her mind. She was going to the police. This is Marguerite Muir. - Do you remember me? - I remember. - I came about... - I remember very well. You have a good memory. We have it here for you you. from 8 to 12 and from 2 to 5 I'm so pleased. I'm on my way. I'm the person. You called. I'm here for my wallet. Perhaps it wasn't you I spoke to. Yes, it was. It was me. This way. You have it then? - Where did you lose it? - I didn't lose it, it was stolen. My bag was snatched. Oh! Wait... Do you have my bag too? I'm afraid no. Where did you find it? The thief emptied out your bag. He found nothing. He got rid of the bag. He took the bus. Why the bus? He emptied the wallet. He found the money. Was there money in it? Three fifty-euro notes. He dumped the wallet in the car park. Which car park? the shopping centre one. Which shopping centre? In L'Hay-les-Roses. Yes, I know where that is. That's so far from where I live. He probably spent it all on CDs and tapes. Yes that's possible. well, anyway, sign here. And in future... I'd like to know who found my wallet. I'd like to thank the person. Mr Palet, Georges. What's he like? As a man? Just being curious. Is he young or Old? Just being curious. Please, It's only natural. An individual aged around fifty, average height, slim, almost white hair, with eyes, let me see... light-coloured, yes, very light, kind eyes. But odd. A lined face. Something must have wasted him. an illness, or a big problem. But a very big problem. In short, an odd fellow indeed. I didn't understand all he said. - But the main thing is... - You said it. - You have a good memory. - But, no... What's the problem? Have you been attacked again? Not exactly. That's why I wanted to see you. - What's wrong? - Nothing too serious but it's taking on such proportions... I thought that maybe I could stop by to see you. Of course, but tell me what's wrong. Well, this fellow, this man, this gentleman... The gentleman who found my wallet... Yes, what about him? - This is so awkward... - Is he demanding a reward? In a way, yes. How do you mean, in a way? Is he... propositioning you? - No! - Is he threatening you? No... Well yes... well no. Oh, you're getting on my nerves. - Pardon me? - He's demanding to see me. - And? - He wants to know me. - That's all? - He keeps writing to me. - He'll calm down. - He won't. Yesterday Morning... What happened? He came to my street. He slashed the tires on my car. Now that changes everything. That's much more serious. You must come in to see us. That's what I want to do, but not to press charges. You have to make a statement I don't want any trouble. He's probably a decent man. I'd just like you to talk to him Is that possible? Can you do that? And repaint the attic door too. You know, the dormer window. Understand? You see what I mean? Well sorry. Forgive me. that's not what I meant. I'm late, I had a bad night. You'll do it then? - I can count on you? - Yes. See that plane? That's a Cessna Skylane. 230 horsepower, 270 km/h at top speed. 1700 Km on a full tank. And put some newspaper down. For the drops of paint. Come in, it's not locked! Is it my wife? No, no, don't worry. We just want a word. I'll come down. - Do you recognize me? - Of course. I didn't from above. It's the cap. But now I do. Repainting the house? My wife wants to change the gate and the door. The rest has to match. With something new in something old, in an old house I mean, you have to replace everything. It's true. You have no choice. The previous stuff, the old stuff, soon becomes unbearable. You should just grow old and let it grow old with you. - But my wife... - Are you married? For thirty years now. I even have grandchildren. But I see this will take a while. We'd better sit down. - Coming? - Lead the way. Come in. Let me tidy up. - Something to drink? -No thanks - You Neither? No. All right. But, if you don't mind... I'll have a quick one. Have a seat. It's good to sit down. Being up a ladder wears your legs out, keeping yourself steady. I'm afraid of falling of hurting myself, of surviving. My right foot really aches. I must have hurt myself. I was steadying myself with it. Let me take a look. Seen this? Do you remember the wallet? You bet I remember it! And Miss Muir, you remember her? Yes, her too. Have you met? No, she called me last Sunday to thank me. For what, God knows. I couldn't talk. My daughter was here, with her husband. My son too. He doesn't have children. He has decided not to. I understand that. To reproduce what? We couldn't talk much. I mean, her and me. She thanked me and that was that. I see. Have you heard from her since? Why would I? - You could have. - Yes, you could have. - Yes you could have. - It happens. - You get acquainted. - You talk, calk back. - Or write. - Yes, or write. - Yes, or write. - Did you write to her? No! - You get acquainted. - You talk. You call back. Or write. - Or write. - Yes, or write. - Did you write to her? - No! You get acquainted. You call back. You write. Yes you write. Yes, or write. Did you write to her? No! Listen. We're here to help you. To stop you doing anything stupid. Something stupid? Do I look as if I would? Look at the state I'm in. If I could, do you know what I'd do? - No. - The same thing my old neighbor did! On the dole at 50. Married, two kids. He blew his brains out. Boom! Bang! His wife remarried. They're redoing the house. see what that means? It means... Oh, damn it. Listen, all that's very sad. But Miss Muir came to see us. She told us everything. That's not possible. - She didn't do that. Not her! - She did! The bitch. I mean it, what a bitch! I didn't mean her any harm. Neither did she. She didn't file a complaint. She isn't even asking you to refund her costs. She just wants to be left alone. She has requested us to ask you that. So I'm asking you. Will you? Shit, shit, I'm sick of this bloody life. - well is the answer yes? - Yes, yes. - You promise? - Yes. Can we count on you? - Yes. - No worries then? I said yes. There you go. That's a fine paint job. a beautiful colour, isn't Bernard? Don't you like it? Doing everything in blue? Ouch! - It's nearly over now. - Go ahead. You're hurting me. It's over. You can rinse. I never promised you'd get your milk teeth back. Look how handsome you are. - Like at the barber's. - I was about to say something stupid. - What? - No it's too silly. Say it anyway. I was going to say, I can smile at you now. I was even going to say next time too. But there won't be a next time. But you'll be back, won't you? No more visions of you bending down over me to fill my teeth... - How sweet. Off you go now. It's late. Meet Josepha Belotch. Doctors Muir and Belotch. Two old friends. Inseparable. Pastimes:Josepha, the theater, Marquierite, aviation. A world. A gaping chasm. And their view of men. - Why the smile? - It's old Schwer. Another last-minute decider. It changes nothing, but it gets on my nerves. he made a very pretty declaration before he left. By the way, any news of your.. your brutish suitor? No. No more news. You sound as if... Yes that's how it is. I'm sorry I acted the way I did. I'm worried he'll get into trouble. All right, I'm coming. I'm disturbing you. It's very late. I hope I didn't wake you. Is this Miss Muir? Yes. But how on earth did you know? The voice... The voice. I still don't understand. Georges talks to me a lot about it. He describes it, and believe me, Georges can be very precise. And... And I was really hoping... I can tell you, since you're there. It's just the two of us, two women. I was hoping you'd call. Why? Why were you hoping that? May I talk to him? Probably, but not now. He isn't here. - Where is he? - At the cinema. An old war film near the Place d'Italie. About a US Navy pilot during the Korean war. The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The pilot, shot down, has to be brought back at any cost. His pal comes for him by helicopter. The Koreans wait for it to land. The two men reunite. No shelter. Gunfire. The Koreans kill them both. I'll call back. The film ends in half an hour or so. "it's not far from here" thought Muir. What if I waited for him? Marguerite had half an hour or so. She didn't have any doubts. She knew she'd recognize Georges. Without ever having seen him? Yes. Here's your coffee. Thank you. A double espresso. At this hour. Exiting the cinema, nothing surprises you. Anything can happen. It doesn't surprise you. Anything can happen as naturally as possible. You love me, then? No, no. - It's just... - What? - Don't look like that... - What? Nothing. Well... I was saying: it's just... I was worried about you That's right. deep Down, you can worry without loving. Can't you? Yes, why not? But can one love without worrying? Yes, that too. How did you know I was here? - Your wife. - Ah, yes, my wife. - A kind woman, isn't she? - She's more than that. Yes, well. - What do you want exactly? - To have coffee with you. it feels odd to be walking together. You've barely met. You've spoken on the phone. Let's call it speaking. You'd given up hope of meeting. And now you're walking together. Not very straight. You could almost take each others arm. How was the film? is that all? I was a boy when I first saw it. Really? And? Nothing, it did nothing for me. Not even the two friends' death. war is like that, don't you think? What about you, then? The planes? I don't have much time at the moment, but I hope to fly again soon. perhaps not next Sunday, but soon. You should come. With your wife. - With my wife? - Yes. I'm sure she'd like it. With my wife. - I see. - You see what? Dr. Muir is not here? She's been held up. Please come in. Thank you. Because of Georges, that conversation, you sweep aside the important reasons. You focus on details. For instance? instead of thinking "why did i go there for?" "what I was doing there?" You think: "my hair didn't look good. " "Perhaps he didn't like my nose. " he looked at it as if he'd never see it again. "I hope he didn't see my teeth. " "Did he notice my feet?" - What's going on? - Nothing. Are you ill? No... well, I don't think so. A patient asked if you were ill. It surprised me. It's astounding. - Seriously. What's going on? - Nothing. - How do you mean? - Nothing, okay. - What about your patients? - I couldn't care less. Really? Couldn't care less. But honey... No patients, no money. No money, no plane. Have you thought of that? Let's think about it. she had bought an old Spit. A Spitfire. Dating from the war. In need of renovation but a beauty. With Mickey and a few others. Five with Mickey. All crazy about engines. They needed 60,000 euros, peanuts and a pilot. Muir volunteered. The boys applauded. Not only for the money. They knew how Marguerite flew. They had seen her at work. Me too. I'll pick you up at one. Thank you. Why don't you use your knife? What's wrong? Is that him? Is that him? Yes. I see. I'll talk to him, you'll see. Oh, no, don't. Stay here. Oh Lord, I'm tipsy. Leave her alone. Who? Come on. we're leaving. Ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to begin. What a talent. Genius. The show is about to begin. Take your places. - What? Were you talking to me? - If Georges had been here... Don't start that again. I want to see him, you hear? I have to. - What do you mean? - Don't worry about it. - I'll call him. - Call him tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. I want to see him now. At this hour? Are you out of your mind?. Could I speak to Georges? - Is this Miss Muir? - Yes. It's very late, but could I talk to him? He's out. - At the cinema again? - No. - I have to talk to you. - To me? - Now? But... - Please. It won't take long. well, if you really think so. Why not? - It's absurd. What will you say to her? - Don't worry. Wait here. You are exactly as I pictured you. Let's have a cup of tea, shall we? Couldn't you park better than that? I'd like to get through to my house. So, it's you. What are you doing here? Waiting for me? No, I'm waiting for Marguerite. - Really? Your car, honestly... You, on the other hand... let me release you. - Bringing them home now? - Of course not. She's Marguerite's friend. What's your name again? - Josepha. Excuse me, I'm parched. Could I have a glass of water? Of course. Come with me to the kitchen. What are you doing in my home? Oh, no. Don't shout because if you do I'll start shouting too. And we can't start shouting. - By the way, how was it? - Not bad. Futile but not bad. I could see her coming. I knew she'd try to have me one of these days. I made the first move. That way it's settled. Go now. I never want to see you again. You understand? You're hurting me. You're hurting me. Same time Thursday? You hurt me all the same. See you Thursday. You're hurting me. Ouch! You're hurting me. Ouch, ouch, ouch! You're hurting me. Stop it! You're hurting me. Close your mouth now. Someone will take care of you. There's a patient in my office. Could you finish up? I'll be in touch. But where are you going? Where are you going? For God's sake, tell me! Miss Muir? Is that you? Is it really you? How long has it been? I've come to see it. Can you let me in? Three, four... Margot, greet the moon greet the sun and the stars for me. Take off, the aircraft flies away above the hangars and the rooftops Margot, greet the moon greet the sun and the stars for me. It's us! Oh Lord, they're so silly... You can't be so silly. Oh, you're top-notch mechanics, but you;re four fools. Four idiots. But. I'm fond of you, really very fond. Give me a kiss. What about me? No way! What do you say, boys? Shall we let her drink her coffee? Hi, Josepha? Stop it. I'm right there Hadn't you seen me? I had. Well no. I shouldn't have? Will it wear the bell out? You're thinking of the bill? Do you want me to chip in? Seriously, do you want me to? Carry on, you interest me. There's a start to everything. Are you gardening? What do you want? I've come to fetch you. Me? What for? To go Where? Not just you, I wouldn't have come otherwise. I'll ask again. What for? to go where? There. Where? Where? You're making me repeat all my questions? I repeat: Where is there?

I was afraid you wouldn't come. We have to go, don't we? Yes. - Want to sit in the front? - No, you. - Sit in the front. - No I said. - You're not coming? - Certainly not. You go without me. - You want to take over? - Oh, no please. I'm here, there's no danger. I'll be watching him Well do you fancy trying? Acrobatics, you don't do them here. They're not allowed.
