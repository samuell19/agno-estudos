- It was my ambition to, to really liberate the world. Why not? I mean, why settle for anything less? And I have a sense of humor about it. I know the odds are against me, but we only have a few years here. Let's try to leave this spaceship a better place. ♪ Timothy Leary's dead ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, he's outside, looking in ♪ ♪ Timothy Leary's dead ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, he's outside, looking in ♪ - The Harvard professor who became the outlaw acid king of the 1960s is dead. - Timothy Leary has died as he lived, in a rather unconventional fashion. - He died at his Beverly Hills home at the age of 75. - He was a counterculture icon of the sixties, an author, a lecturer, an ex-con and a celebrity. - [Narrator] His zest for dying was not unlike his zest for living life to the fullest. In 1967, he counseled the world of young people to quote, "Turn On, Tune In and Drop Out." Many of them did with psychedelic drugs, but he was also a respected Harvard psychologist until he became a renegade. - To me, he was a driven man and a great philosopher and a seeker of the truth and a futurist. And he always kept a very positive attitude and always kept working and working and working and always saying, if I make too much money, you have to tell me, because that means I'm doing something wrong. - [Narrator] One of his greatest moments of excitement came when he learned that some of his remains, a few grams of his ashes, would be carried to outer space. - So when he saw that burst of that light, he said, "That's me!" - This rogue intellectual, this visionary genius will be around on the web net for the cyber generation and beyond. - Timothy Leary, by the way, had said that he was thrilled to learn that he had inoperable prostate cancer. To him, death was just a promising adventure. And when it came for him this morning, he left behind a lot of people who say they will miss him. And some who say they will not. ♪ Oh, Danny boy, ♪ ♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ ♪ From glen to glen, and down the mountainside ♪ ♪ The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying ♪ ♪ It's you, it's you must go, and I must bide ♪ ♪ But come ye back when summer's in the meadow ♪ ♪ Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ♪ ♪ Yes, I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow ♪ ♪ Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy ♪ ♪ I love you so ♪ ♪ But when ye came ♪ ♪ And all the flowers are dying ♪ ♪ And I was dead, as dead I will may be ♪ ♪ He'll come and find the place where I am lying ♪ ♪ And kneel and say an Ave there for me ♪ ♪ And I will hear, though soft you tread above me ♪ ♪ And on my grave, will warmer sweeter be ♪ ♪ And ye will bend and tell me that you love me ♪ ♪ And I will sleep in peace ♪ ♪ Until you come to me ♪ ♪ Oooooooo ♪ - I went into psychology 20 years ago, basically as a career. I was simple-minded enough to take seriously the motto's of psychology, that psychologists supposed to be finding out what goes on with the human being. And five years ago, by accident in Mexico, I took Mexican mushrooms. So-called magic mushrooms of Mexico. And I learned more about my brain and its possibilities. And I learn more about psychology in the five hours after taking these mushrooms than I had in the preceding 15 years of studying doing research in psychology. (various chimes sounding) - [Prison Interviewer] What were you really advocating then? - Well, my main message is use your head, specifically, learn how to use your nervous system. It's this, for the last 15 years, I've been studying my own nervous system. I've gotten to use my own nervous system, the way Leeuwenhoek and the first men that got the microscope, or Galileo, the first guy that got the telescope, it takes years to learn how to focus it and dial it and tune it. I know that the nervous system is a computer. We can program it in many different directions. It's like a series of motion picture or television cameras. We can focus it and turn it around on different objects. It's, it's electronic, it's electric. We can dial it and tune it. It's there to be used. And the challenge of the human race right now, I call it the neurological age we're going into, we've got to learn how to use our heads. LSD is an extremely powerful mind opening agent. We are now in the Psycho-Chemical Age. In the future, it's not going to be what book do you read? But which chemical do you use to open your mind to accelerate learning? - The drug revolution in America was a disaster. And to the extent that Timothy Leary promoted that, he was the high priest of the drug revolution. He had of course a philosophy that went beyond that. But I'm talking about the main thing that he did had a very negative effect. - [Prison Interviewer] Are you ahead of your time? Is that why you haven't been accepted totally yet? Are you too far ahead of? - Yes, I'm in a kind of a time warp. (soft flute music) - [Female Newscaster] Timothy Leary was the Psychedelic Movement's prophet of perception, a high profile LSD advocate who was scaring the hell out of mainstream America. - We are neurologically and biochemical in touch with thousands of generations that came before us. It's just that our mental symbolic minds can't decode these messages. And many have been discovering this experience and developing methods to get high or to go out of their mind, for thousands of years. I think that I was the person that was in a position of stature and respectability and basically power. I could say this cause I didn't want tenure. I didn't want to be a professor. I didn't want government funding. The government never gave us a dime for our research. Some private groups did, so that I simply wasn't intimidated and everything we were doing was legal and open. There are a lot of people, young usually men, the aim of their whole thing is to get to Harvard, like salmon coming up stream, they flop into Harvard, and they don't, that's the end. They're Harvard professors. The same time, you've had at Harvard, for a long time, people like the counterculture and the transcendental and the "All is One" movement. You had Emerson and you had Thoreau, remember Thoreau and Emerson? Thoreau in prison, you know what? When Emerson came and said, what are you doing in there, David? And he said, what are you doing out there? I mean, Thoreau one of our great, great philosophers, was in prison for failing to pay a tax to support the Mexican war. - [Male Newscaster] The man in the middle with glasses, Richard Albert, one of the two Americans most often blamed or praised for the psychedelic revolution. - I've had, as I say, LSD over 300 times. And one of the dramatic characteristics of the psychedelic experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways in which they are like you. We had a lot of kind of charming hysteria for awhile. Yes, humor and stuff. And then I went off into the living room and I started to have this very dissociative experience. So you started to have this dissociative experience of where all you become is awareness, is a point of awareness, that's all that's left. I remember the first time this happened to me, as professor went, and middle-class boy went, and pilot went and all of my games were like, going off into the distance. Like I only had a body left and then I couldn't find my body look with my eyes open, and I got frightened. And I got the panic, which is the panic that proceeds the psychological death. Because indeed, Richard Albert was dying at that point. And the panic was no stop, stop! I've got to hold on to something so I'll know who I am. And I was about to scream for Timothy when I went through the doorway, I mean, I was about to scream. And Timothy, the wise old Timothy always says things like trust your nervous system. Suddenly, I went and became so free and knowing who I was and being, resting in my being. And I thought, boy, have I been screwed my whole life! I had been cut off from this thing. And I went out cartwheeling in the snow, outside Tim's house. - When we first started our research at Harvard, we middle-class professors didn't know what this was about. One thing we learned right from the beginning is don't use the language of psychiatry because the language of psychiatry is sick, well, doctor, patient, you've got this neurosis, you've got the psychosis, almost forcing the person to be a victim. - We were heretics at Harvard. And then we were heretics in a society because you're advocating the overthrow... Come on in, Ralph! Hi! - [Male News Announcer] Dr. Ralph Metzner, a psychopharmacologist and Timothy Leary's principal assistant. - When you take LSD, everything falls apart. All learned structures, all thought patterns, all the beliefs, opinions, emotional convictions, positive or negative. They all fall apart. How a person sees himself, what he thinks of himself. Huxley and Gerald Heard and Humphry Osmond, and various people said, no, no, you can't, you know, tell everybody to turn on. This has to be kept quiet. He'd say no, that's an elitist thing. You know, the time for that has passed. The need is too great. - [Male Interviewer] Your not saying LSD can not be misused? - Of course, it's a form of energy and it releases energy. And any form of energy, which man has discovered, can be used for ill or for good. It can be used to gain power, control over other people, or it can be used to help people develop and grow. - And we had spent about a year on the faculty together, teaching some course together, he was a widower with two children. Everybody else in that situation knows they're at Harvard and they're playing it for what they can do with it. And I mean, there's a tremendous amount of "publish and perish" and all of that sort of thing. And Timothy was just different than that. He didn't care. I came back to Harvard in February. He already had a project going. And his project was basically saying, the experience I had in Mexico was true and profound. These things are treated in my culture as psychotomimetic by the psychiatric community, as pathology inducing things. I think that's the wrong metaphor for them. I'm going to do research as a Harvard professor. I think that's an incredibly big leap. - Scientific studies have proven that the human brain has dozens, maybe over a hundred receptor sites. These are little locks to the brain. And each of these receptor sites has been designed over millions of years by DNA genetics to be opened up by a certain plant that's out there. That's, that's very poetic. That the plant queendom for thousands of years, had been evolving in synchronicity with mammals, warm blooded mammals with brains. And still today, these plants have this automatic effect on the brain. Nothing happens by synchronicity or accident. I think it's evolution. - What charmed me about Timothy was that his, his ability to continually undercut the, the parameters of my mind. He was constantly pushing the edges of the envelope, you might say. He was constantly looking at things in a slightly different way. - He had a gift for talking to large groups of people that was totally phenomenal, kind of the, this Irish oratory. And if you look at what happened in the sixties with psychedelics, the sixties was the birth of the civil rights movement. It was the beginning of the ecology movement. It was the beginning of the women's movement, it was, liberation movement. It was the beginning of the sexual revolution. It was the beginning of the anti-war movement. And I would - [Richard Alpert] And rock and roll, minstrels to carry the whole thing. - Tremendous cultural creativity that was released. And I would be willing to bet that in every single one of those movements, some psychedelic experiences played a role. (meditation music) - [Meditating Woman] It's like dying and being reborn. To take one little piece out of one of my experiences, I could say, I became the idea of a stained glass window. I entered a cavern of dripping jewels. - It doesn't, it does hurt my feelings, I must admit to see Tim being the subject of such relentless negativity continuing to this day. I think it's quite unfair. And he's basically being blamed. He's a scapegoat for people's own fears and their own messed up neurotic preoccupations. - That's making me into a victim, and who's the cause of my victim hood, some terrible people that disgraced me, or else I was wrong, I was disgraced. There is no disgrace here. My mother was upset, of course, and all my Irish Catholic relatives, Timothy is being thrown out of Harvard. But, and I respect that and I was very sorry that that happened. But believe me, the last thing in the world I wanted to do was to have tenure at Harvard. I'd still be there with moss growing out of me. (peaceful guitar music) - I think he had told me that he, he may have been an altar boy as a kid. And he told me that his dad was a dentist and was the first person that turned him on to nitrous oxide when he was just a kid. And, and he liked that a lot. And that his his mom was very straight-laced, and from what I understand, very disapproving. He also tells me that his grandfather had tons and tons of books. And Tim used to go visit his grandfather and his grandfather's room and, and, and take some of the books. And his, I think his grandfather told him Timothy don't ever be like everybody else. - Before he even discovered LSD, he was this, you know, sort of iconoclastic rabble rouser, Irish type. - Ireland has been in a wonderful position of being a counter-culture to England, and being protected by it, and it's obvious that England tried to control the Irish. And most of the good Irish got out and became in the wind. - His whole philosophy is everything's an individual thing. To not, not be sort of, go along with the robot societal norms. And that's very unusual these days. I mean, everybody's saying conform, conform, conform, and Timothy Leary is saying, no, no, that's not the way that it is. You're an individual, be that individual. You're a god, act like one. - You can be Irish without ever going to Ireland in the sense of having a sense of, of looking at the other side, being outside the establishment of keeping moving, and finding other people like you, that are all around, all the time, and you'll find them in poetry, you'll find them in art, you'll find them in music. I have been from an early age, fascinated by the great intellectual adventures, of the philosophic challenges. I always wanted to be a philosopher. So I was immediately drawn to this experience. When I, when I heard about it. - When you take LSD and your consciousness expanded, the number of possibilities and the number of perspectives dramatically multiplies. And then you're in real ontological confusion. That's why we always have urged people, don't take LSD unless you're very well-prepared, unless you're specifically prepared to go out of your mind. Don't take it unless you have someone that's very experienced with you to guide you through it. And don't take it unless you are ready to have your perspective on yourself and life dramatically change, because you're going to be a different person. Jack Kennedy did take drugs, including LSD at the White House with a woman named Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was the ex-wife of Cord Meyer, who was the dirty tricks head of the CIA, the Number Two guy there. I'm telling you the story to tell you about the drug thing was happening at that time. I probably pushed my nervous system as much as any human being living. I've taken LSD over 500 times, and I've experienced a wide range of these biochemical neurological possibilities. (peaceful piano music) - [Male News Anchor] Timothy Leary's rented estate is almost as fantastic by day as it is by night. 3000 acres, complete with man-made lakes, in the rolling woodlands of upstate New York. - We were visited by people from every form of consciousness experimentation. Yogis, we were wall-to-wall yogis and swamis and Taoists and tea leaf readers and vegetarians, and anything. We were interested. We wanted to know because we were square Harvard professors, and we didn't know much about this. - Peggy Hitchcock, who was a friend of ours, said, I think my brothers just bought this place, this cattle ranch, and there's an old house on it, up in Millbrook. Let's go. And we drove up, she and I, and I came to this house, a 63 room house, all boarded up, but indoor walk-in refrigerators, nine bathrooms. I said, this is our place. She said, well, if you want it, you'll have to turn on my brothers. They were both 22. They were part of the Mellon family. So at that point I took on my project of turning them on. The first year was absolutely unbelievably idyllic. We had this incredibly beautiful home. We had a web of friends and a network of creative and interesting people pouring in and out. We had the New York city scene, plus the Millbrook scene. And then there were these weekends where everybody just played together. Maynard Ferguson was down at the Gatehouse with, with Flo and the kids. (horn playing) There were football games. It was like the Kennedy years at Hyannisport, or something like that. It had that quality. Wonderful, big feasts and great experiments. And somebody was always on trips. We were always guiding trips there or running trips. And that was a very beautiful time. - So you're never going to be sure exactly who's who and who's supposed to do what. If anybody from the community is asked to run a psychedelic session or cook a meal or to run a television camera... (mystical electronic music) - He used to get phone calls that would come into, to Millbrook from people. And he would take these phone calls from people. He didn't know who the hell they were at all. And a lot of them were people freaking out on LSD somewhere. They'd never taken it. And one of the most common things for them to say was that Dr. Leary, you've got to help me! I'm dying, I'm dying! He'd say, yes, you are dying. And then he'd say, and so am I. And he explained, he'd explain the 50 billion year old life process and all the cells dying and living and dying and living. And, you know, new body every six years and your own blah, blah, blah. Pretty soon the person would be cooled out and wouldn't, you know, fly off a bridge or something. - There was a field where the last summer, we all went out and moved out there and lived in teepees. We did that on Lunacy Hill and it was lunacy for us to go out there. But also there was another hill further on called Ecstasy Hill. And these were all places where people would go and trip and do these wonderful things, throw out their clothes, have a marvelous time swimming in the lakes, whatever. It was, 2,500 acres, completely fenced in. It was a world into itself. - People could take the psychedelics in whatever way they wanted, as long as they wrote a report. And we made sure that it was in some way safe. - Local kids were saying, what's going on up there? We've got to go find out. So they would come up. And there were a lot of girls schools, Vasser is nearby. There was Bernard Junior Girls School in Millbrook, and they had signs at the school that said Any girl seen at Millbrook entering or leaving the property, or is there, is immediately expelled. And that was true for all of them because they'd come in and they go waltzing on back to college turned on. - Allen Ginsberg first came to see us when we were beginning and we had a psilocybin mushroom drug session for him. I think Huxley was there. He was in one room upstairs, and his boyfriend, Peter was in another one. During the experience, they wandered down through the house naked - it was kind of a mansion house. And it was, it was almost old Testament prophetic that here was a prophet coming, his eyes were gleaming. - Most everybody there took LSD. We settled down to discussing the situation, discussing the images being set up against everybody, and reinforced and listening to Joan Baez records on the phonograph and chanting Buddhist prayer. - And I recommend, respectfully to this committee that you consider legislation, which will license responsible adults to use these drugs for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth. - At about two or three in the morning, one in the morning. I'm not sure the time I heard these sounds, like this kind of (animal noises) this animal growling, anger sound, get up, get up. And I, you know, realized that it was some kind of problem, some kind of raid. - The first time that I was harassed by the law was on a Saturday night, at midnight. I was in my bedroom with my wife and I was talking to my son and the door banged open. And in came G. Gordon Liddy with 24 armed and booted sheriffs. - [Prison Interviewer] Warrant? Did they have a warrant on hand? - Uh, yeah, but the warrant was, they found no mariajuana, the warrant was thrown out. They, they did confiscate a little plant that we had on peat moss, which was a geranium. - Funny thing about Liddy is that he was the one guy that was like, nice, polite, was not a problem. Didn't bully anybody. He came up to me said, hi, hello, how are you? What's your name? Took it on a clipboard. Didn't try to arrest me, harass me, bother me, push me in a corner or anything else. And the people that were the were the assholes, the horrible, you know, sheriffs and the, the, the, the townsmen, you know, with the badges. - Now Gordon Liddy then ran for Congress on the basis that he had driven me out of the county. And from there, he went to the White House as a drug expert. And how did Gordon Liddy get to be a drug expert? Because he had fought Timothy Leary. - It was like that attack on Dr. Frankenstein's castle to get the invisible monster. It basically, in fact, the place looked like Dr. Frankenstein's castle. And the townspeople did, were all coming with hoes and scythes and shovels and, you know, trying. And they probably were still worried that Dr. Frankenstein will come back and start the monster up again. ♪ Oh Lord, take me higher ♪ ♪ Than a bird can fly ♪ ♪ Oh Lord, take me higher ♪ ♪ Until I touch the sky ♪ ♪ Oh Lord, take me higher ♪ ♪ To that sweet bye and bye ♪ ♪ Oh Lord, take me higher ♪ ♪ Hey, before I die ♪ - Tim got thrown out of every institution he ever belonged to, including the United States of America. And Afghanistan, and the Black Panther party. He got thrown out of, you know, West Point for smuggling alcohol, I think, right? - Yeah. (laughter) - I think, which everybody else was doing to, but. - I was actually thrown out of Holy Cross, but they let me stay on without leaving and same thing at West Point. No, they couldn't, no, they couldn't throw me out, but I agreed to resign if they'd apologize. And I got thrown out of the University of Alabama, we're spending the night at the girls' dormitory. (women screaming) - The Catholic Church never threw him out. He went away from the Catholic Church. I mean, I, yeah. (laughter) You know, I was with Matthew Fox, he got thrown out. - Right, yeah, Long Island. (laughter) I said to him, I only got thrown out of Harvard, you got thrown out of the Catholic Church. - Boy that's big time. - Yeah that's big time stuff. (laughter) - I was married for 13 years to Rosemary Woodruff, who was, we were together at Millbrook, and she helped me escape from prison, we were together in Europe and all that. And she now is spending a lot of time here. As a matter of fact, she came, she was here last week and she's coming back next week, so, I'm still in very close touch with Rosemary. This is the house decorated by my ex wife, Barbara who left two years ago. We were together for 13 years. And her son, Zach is the young man that's your host today. - [Narrator] You're also married to Nina, Uma Thurman's mother, right? And there was Joanna, and your first wife was Marianne, right? - My deepest love, yes Yes, we were together again for 11 years. Yeah. And she killed herself on my 35th birthday. (Somber guitar music) Huxley predicted how he wanted to die. And indeed, he did it himself. And I came to see him just down the road here at Mulholland drive in Hollywood, to bring him a copy of a book we'd written about it called "The Tibetan book of the Dying" and to talk with his wife, Laura, and then two or three days later, as she's described in her book, this timeless moment, he wrote down LSD and she gave him LSD. And Dr. Sydney Cohen who was probably the most famous worldwide doctor on drugs was there. And Dr. Cohen from UCLA gave him LSD. And he gave him also the, going away pills that allowed him to, to die in peace and in dignity the way he had written about in his own books. (chiming cymbals) I consider the, how you die to be the greatest decision you make in your life. We had no choice, after all, of where and with whom we were born. You know, you were there in the womb, and you popped it out and you didn't know what you're going to find. And in many of the great decisions in our life like marriages or graduations, it's, you know, social and all that. But to arrange the greatest moment of your life, it should be the going away party, the graduation celebration. And I've been planning it for, for many years. - [Interviewer] He's expressed that he's going to have his body frozen. - [Richard Alpert] His whole body? I just thought it was his head. - [Interviewer] They're just going to freeze his head? - That's what I, he only paid for the head. I didn't know he was getting the whole body. I don't know. (laughter) Maybe he's got his whole body. - [Interviewer] Is it a special deal? - I mean, I don't know. I just assumed. - [Interviewer] Why would, why would somebody, why would somebody freeze their head? - Well, they'd freeze their brain. He, he's really interested in freezing his brain. Isn't he? I mean, that's what I understand. Not his body. - When science has progressed to position where they can, for example cure a cancer right away. They can maybe pop my brain in a unfortunate person that the brain, their brain is dead, but their body's still alive. It could be a hell realm. It could be also absolute... He could be laughing all the way to the bank up in heaven and say, I did it! I got it, I froze the brain. Now we'll go, oh, wait until I show the establishment this. - But it's probably going to happen two rooms down, they'll pickle me, or they'll put stuff in to keep my, my dead brain and my dead body alive. The soul is the key here because there's an agreement that the soul is the essence of an individual and your consciousness. And if you study the dictionary definition of soul, it's kind of embarrassing. It's very much like the dictionary definition of brain. - All of the history of all of the mysticism of religions have all suggested that who we are is not our body and who we are is not our thinking mind. Timothy's going in the face of that at the moment. - [Ralph Metzner] He is! - He is carrying philosophical materialism to an exquisite, exquisite penultimate point. ♪ I wandered barefoot through the Haight ♪ ♪ My hair was long and straight ♪ ♪ Time out of body out of mind ♪ ♪ And if you never see me again ♪ ♪ Remember flowers, not guns ♪ ♪ And beaded vests and tattered jeans again ♪ ♪ Time out of body out of mind ♪ ♪ Probably find the diggers ♪ ♪ Probably won't go home ♪ ♪ Probably find the pot of gold and rainbows all the same ♪ ♪ It's a psychedelic baby of the mind ♪ ♪ A Coney Island baby of the mind ♪ ♪ Time out of body out of mind ♪ - It's true, a much higher percentage of people in California who have come because they want something different. They wanted to do things they can't do back there. I see flowers, I listen to flutes. I see searching young people who are looking for beauty. I see joy. I see no guns. I see no handcuffs. I think this is a holy place. It looks perhaps strange to the whiskey drinking middle-class person, but every new religion, every new sacrament looks strange. - He said, it's my mission to introduce this drug to the world. He said it like a general. If there are a few casualties, I still have to look at the larger picture. - And when he saw those 20, 30,000 people, at the Human Be-In, it really affected his mind. He had a speech prepared, - Right. Which he didn't make, and he looked out at that crowd and he said, "Turn on, tune in... - That's right. "and drop out." - And you know why you didn't make that speech? - Drop out from college, - Yeah. Drop out from your jobs, drop out. - Right, and that became the mantra! - Turn on, tune in and drop out. We're turned on. And we're tuned in. And we're very dropped out, - Turn on, tune in and drop out. (laughter and applause) - A mantra is something is repeated over and over and causes an effect to take place. The mantra was turn in, tune on, drop out. Or, turn on. (laughter) Turn on, - Tune in, and drop out. - Yeah, that's it. (laughter) (peaceful guitar music) - The establishment, I don't even like to say that, but that's essentially what it is. It was churches, that were afraid of the new doctrine. It was politicians that scared that people were, were saying that we're not going to go to Vietnam, but that was politicians saying you've got to go. I mean, you go where we tell you. There was a whole revolution going on among the young saying, no, no, no, no, we, there's something we can drop out of. And what we're dropping out of is your vision of what this world is all about. And the reason we're dropping out is, let us tell you about it. We've seen the way this world can be when you see it from a higher perspective. And that, that was what Tim was doing. - [Male News Person] The favorite pastimes of the hippies, besides taking drugs, are demonstrations and partying, seminars and groups of discussions. And they take many trips. And the trip of the hippies is generally an unusual one. - Well, I mean, it's no secret that the Beatles took at LSD and they took LSD very early on before, you know, in 66, 67, when Sergeant Pepper's was coming up. (peaceful mediation music) - This was a real historic event. It totally changed the scope and opened up the pop culture. - [Interviewer] Did the Beatles learn about LSD through Timothy Leary? - Oh, who didn't at the time? You know, I think, and, I mean, the Beatles were definitely publicly in support of his cause when it was happening, you know. John and Yoko and Tim were always in touch and the Beatles saw the Maharishi, that's when I think Tim and John first met and they did, of course, in 1969 the, the hotel "Give Peace a Chance." - Peace. P E A C E. P E A C E. - All we all saying is give peace a chance, all we are saying is give peace a chance, etcetera, etcetera. ♪ All we all saying ♪ ♪ Is give peace a chance ♪ ♪ That's all were saying ♪ ♪ All we all saying ♪ ♪ Is give peace a chance ♪ (soft guitar music) - I mean, these psychedelic drugs lead to all kinds of things that turning away from responsibility one's not always in control of what they're doing, their emotions, it's an illusionary perception. What we're trying to teach young people today is to be in control, to be a part of the system, to take responsibility for your action. I think the whole counter culture movement of the sixties, the free spirit "Do your own Thing" movement has really been the death knell of the nineties. I think we have very, very profound problems in this society today and an abundance of those problems and the degradation of society in general can attributed to drug use because psychedelic drugs were advocated back in the sixties, back in the Woodstock, "Me Generation," as let's enlighten ourselves, let's expand our perceptions and horizons. This appeal to the gratification of the senses lead to a total denial of personal responsibility and a moral and spiritual responsibility. So we're gratifying the sensual rather than the soul. - Albert Hoffman was the discover of lysergic acid. It wasn't snake oil, it wasn't phony cancer cures. It was something that changed my life for the better and changed the lives of almost everybody that I know, who I care about. (peaceful harmonica music) - People nowadays talk about recreational drug use. Okay, that was, there was nothing the least bit recreational about my drug use. It was not at all recreational. It's very serious work. When I was a little kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to go into space. And then as I got older, it just seemed to me like, if you want to go into space, the kind of people who go into space are, like the Firesign Theater said, people who like to sleep in tubes and push buttons, adventurers like you. So, you know, it seemed to me like if you wanted to go into space, you know, clip off your hair and follow orders for 20 years. And the people who, you know, control space might, you know, deign to shoot out there. Taking LSD, it's like space. It's not easy to get there. (electronic noises) You know, these guys on the way into space, they suffer G forces, their faces are all distorted. They go with the free fall, and get sick and puke. They have to go through all this training. It's difficult. Eventually you learn how to do it. That's how it was to me with taking LSD. I mean, at first you'd experience all this, you know, horrific distortion and pressures and so forth. And you know, you'd learn to deal with it. - [Male Interviewer] What about going out a window and getting involved with the sidewalk 12 floors under? - Well, the hundreds of thousands people taking LSD, how many people have done that? The statistics show that taking LSD is no more dangerous than signing up for four year course at Harvard college, a certain percentage of people who do either are going to get into trouble, but there's no scientific evidence that LSD causes any such. - [Male Interviewer] Any distortion of the sort of root to say suicide statistic or the root? - Or mental hospital commitment. - [Male Interviewer] Mental hospital commitment. - There's no evidence. - People like Timothy Leary who were in, in somewhat positions of power and authority who advocated the use of drugs. I mean are 10 times worse than the drug dealer on the street because the drug dealer on the street, Hey, you want to buy it? I'll sell it to you. He's not out there espousing and advocating the use of drugs to enhance one's, one's mind perceptions. - I just believe it's the way of our system. It's the way it works. You know, when people come to stand for something that's against the system, they're just, they get shitted on. - [Timothy Leary] Turn on, tune in and drop out. You can't say that, they tell me. But what I am saying happens to be the oldest message of human wisdom. Look within, find your own divinity, detach yourself from social and material struggle. Turn on, tune in and drop out. - Leary terrified an entire generation of parents. I mean, he wanted, they wanted all their kids to get the same kind of education that Leary himself had had. Parents wanted their kids to be PhDs. I mean, Leary after all was a PhD himself. The psychedelic experience was a very grand one. It was almost, it was on one level, almost too easy to come by. Like, why work so hard if you can have a vision just by taking a pill? He did present a lot of temptations to a lot of people that were very hard to resist. But most of the people I knew who spent a year or two completely tripped out, one's a doctor, one's a lawyer, one's a judge. - Sure, people turned on, tuned in and dropped out. And then they turned on and tuned in and took over. (electronic music) (suspenseful music) - He came from a pod of protection and it was inevitable that he would get busted. - Well yeah, it was for possession of a two roaches of marijuana that were found in an ashtray of a car by a cop who was notorious for planting. You know, all this stuff about the OJ trial and planting. Wow, I sure learned a lot about the agricultural tendencies of cops to plant, plant, plant. - [News Announcer] Marijuana cigarettes are called joints. One that has been partly smoked is called a roach. Note this burned hotspot in the paper Unrefined marijuana called unmanicured often contains seeds. Marijuana seeds burn very hot, often exploding, like tiny bombs through the paper. These bomb craters are clearly visible, even at a distance to those who use their eyes. - The roach or the LSD thing is that, all that is, is a, the excuse because in the society, because of our enlightened constitution and bill of rights, you cannot persecute someone for the way they think. - Many of us feel that the current marijuana laws are not only unconstitutional, but extremely severe. And these laws are going to be tested in my appeal to higher court. - He wasn't put in jail until he announced he was going to be governor. And that's when they started the heavy surveillance on Tim and want to put him away. - While he was running for governor, suddenly his bail was revoked and he was running against Ronald Reagan. - I've never been legitimately arrested. I'm in prison now because one evening I was in a parked car and a policeman came up to the car and opened the door against my wishes and made a pass at the ashtray and said, you're under arrest for, and I said, for what? He said, for marijuana! I said, what marijuana? He reached in his pocket. He pulled out two joints that I'd never seen before half joints and said, you're under arrest. A year later, in Orange County, you know Orange County jury believed the policeman's story and found me guilty of possession of marijuana. And then the judge, instead of giving me bail as I was entitled to for appeal, help up a book that I had been writing and said, "Your ideas are dangerous and we're not going to give you bail. We're going to put you in prison to keep you quiet." - The old charge, the same charge that was made against Socrates of corrupting the youth. And that's why Leary was considered the most dangerous men alive, for the same reason Socrates was. - When Nixon called me the most dangerous man alive. Wonderful. Wouldn't you want to have someone like Nixon call you that? - [Interviewer] Did he say the most dangerous man alive, or the most dangerous man in America? - Oh who cares! (Laughter) - [Interviewer] I just wondered, you know? - The most dangerous man he could think of. Oh he includes all Democrats in that too, doesn't he. When Nixon got involved then we had hard times and we couldn't do what we were doing. Damn, right? It was a joke. At one point I was involved in four or five legal criminal things happening with posses and informers and, and FBI teams. So definitely we could not sit around in the forest and meditate by the waterfall. Hell, we were out there like any other persecuted group. (lighter flicks and water bubbles) - What, baby? Hey it's catching me. Yeah, caught. (somber guitar music) - [Prison Interviewer] What are you doing in prison? What do you do on a day by day basis? - I have no trouble keeping myself alert. There's plenty to do here. The main thing doing is taking advantage of this opportunity to study society from this very interesting vantage point. I'm talking to prisoners, I'm listening to them. I'm doing some writing. My literary career zoomed when they put me in prison. I had no rent to pay and I had no job to report to. I had no family situation. Didn't have to produce erections and orgasm. You know, no phones. I was free to read and write. It's been known throughout centuries by philosophers that reading can best be done in a prison. - Its a description of the early acid trips that defined the whole way people think about LSD. - Politics of Ecstasy that you published. - These are the political writings that sparked the whole rebellious sixties. Now, Timothy is no longer just an agent provocateur. He is really a historical figure that has had an impact. So now we're not just looking at him as an immediate threat to the Establishment. Now we're looking at him as someone who really engendered many of the ideas that are becoming the Establishment ideas. - [Jail Interviewer] Timothy, what, what happened when they put you in jail? I want to compare it to what happened to Solzhenitsyn. - You're gonna drag out of your dusty attic of memories. What are you going to drag out to compare my? - [Jail Interviewer] Solzhenitsyn. Oh, we're digging around in the library now, yeah. - [Jail Interviewer] Mandela, Nelson Mandela. - I would say that Solzhenitsyn is not a victim and he would take out his cane and he would shake it at you if you implied that he was a victim. Solzhenitsyn said when he was in the bowels of the Gulag. He had something like 500 years of prison stacked on him. And those Russian prisons are not like a prison farm here in California. Solzhen said one writer can bring down a country, one poet, one song, one catch phrase, one bumper sticker, one graffiti can bring down a country. He said that over and over again. - [Prison Interviewer] What do you think of your future? Do you think you're going to walk out of prison a free man one day? - I think my future is very intimately connected with the future of this country. You just can't keep your philosophers in prison. If I am kept in prison, it's going to be a very bad symptom for freedom and for hope and for union. In a way I'm a spokesman for millions of Americans. And how are you going to bring the country together, if you're going to be locking up people that are saying things that many people believe in. At that point, I realized the only sensible thing to do was to escape. So I went to the reception center where you have to take tests, and on the basis of the tests, they decide where they're going to send you. And when I went to take the test, there was a Mexican American convict there. He was a trustee and he said, Hey, Doc, you're going to laugh, but the test I'm gonna give you are the one that you designed. Cause I did design a test for the California system. (upbeat music) - The fact that he escaped from prison. - [Interviewer] Yeah. - Now that's big stuff, - [Interviewer] That's big stuff. - That's big stuff. That's, you know, that's mythic. - I had to walk at night across the prison yard and climb on top of a tree to get on top of the roof and go across the roof. Where the telephone cable was going out to the gate and I had to shimmy across this. I'd been doing pushups like for three months and I was in, but halfway across, I realized I couldn't do it, but I want to say that we all know what the human body spirit has resources there. I broke Olympic records at the age of fifty. - No man, I don't think I really can fathom the idea of climbing over barbed wire fence and dodging gun trucks, dodging searchlights. - Well, I went underground in this country, got a fake passport and then I shaved off all my hair, so, and I wore glasses and I was a Republican businessman named McClellan. I mean really it's embarrassing, but the, the Senate committee on passport fraud used my pictures as an example of how skillful the fraud could be. - [Prison Interviewer] And then you went on to Algiers. - Uh huh. - [Prison Interviewer] You lived over there with Eldridge Cleaver. And what can you tell me about Eldridge Cleaver? What kind of a man is he? There was a big rift there after you'd lived there for a while. - Eldridge Cleaver and I disagreed strongly on philosophy. And I remember my birthday, October 22nd, 1970. Eldridge gave me a gun. I looked at it and then when he went home, he took the gun with him. But it's the only time I've ever had a gun. I believe that the revolution is a neurological revolution. It's a revolution of consciousness. I think our weapons are electronic, in the media. I saw it more as a spiritual revolution. Eldridge, as you probably know, believed in a violent military revolution. And I felt that this was old fashioned and would get easily wiped out and create bad vibrations where we wanted good vibrations. He actually kidnapped my wife and I at one point. And then the government came in and said, listen. The wonderful thing, the, the assistant foreign secretary of the Algerian government said to Cleaver, this is not Texas Mr. Cleaver. You cannot arrest citizens in our country, and we decide. It was, it was all kind of drama and bad "B" movie. Well, I actually had escaped Algeria and went to Switzerland and I was supposed to, go to Denmark, but I jumped plane in Geneva and the Swiss are wonderful about asylum. I went to Zurich at the same place where James Joyce was in asylum and where Lenin was in asylum. At one point, anyone that was having trouble with their government could escape and go to Switzerland. As long as you had the money. One thing about, don't go to Switzerland unless you've got a credit card, but if you have that, it's a very civilized country. And, but after a year and a half, I love Switzerland. They're wonderful people, but it's boring. And outside of the ski resorts and whatnot, so I had to get out. I made reservations to go to seven or eight different African countries. And I found out that at the time I supposed to come, there were CIA squads waiting for me to come. I made a mistake. I got off the plane in Afghanistan and the Afghanistan government had just become part of the American foreign policy. And so they kidnapped me and sent me back. And then it was, boom, prison, prison, prison. I went to the real heavy duty places like Folsom That's the Harvard of the California system, Folsom's where the old time professional criminals go. When they put me in the cell next to Manson, they were doing it out of a game, and they just kept me there for three or four days. And then they let me out. - [Interviewer] Was there any contact between you and Manson at that point? - He was talking to me all the time. Give me advice, telling me what to do, where I made mistakes. I never felt any bitterness or any fear. I knew that I was prominent enough that they weren't going to kill me or gouge my eyes out. But boy, those guys really, they can throw it at you if they want to. I had about 60 or 70 years, on appeal. - [Interviewer] My gosh. And I knew it was all going to end when the Democrats came in power. And I remember exactly where I was, within three months, I was out of the California criminal thing. - [Female News Announcer] Paroled, Leary adapted to the next decade like a psychedelic chameleon, hitting the college lecture circuit. (upbeat piano music) - Two years ago, Leary surfaced into prominence again by lighting up to smoke at the Austin, Texas airport. It was a protest against the smoking ban. He was promptly arrested. (upbeat piano and cymbals) - Well, I've been through several taboos. We had a taboo about sex. When I grew up as a kid, you couldn't talk about sex. You know, it was really hard to understand the sexual revolution, the drug revolution before the 60s. Doctors had drugs. I mean, you had to have diseases for drugs. And the idea that chemicals, neuro-chemicals could be used by intelligent people, trained to, to learn how to operate their brain. That was a big taboo, big taboo. - Your daughter is a psychopathic case. She is on the verge of insanity. She has marked symptoms of drug addiction. And I firmly believe she has been using marijuana. - [Woman] Margarie, Margarie! (woman screams) - With marijuana, the element that gets your high is THC. We tell the young people that it also destroys your brain cells. Now, I don't know, from what I'm seeing of the young people today, in many cases, there's a lot of problems academically with these people. They don't need to destroy what, what brain cells they have left. - I wasn't allowed to smoke grass publicly in front of my parents until I was 15, yeah. The LSD movement today, I think is very alive and well. - Hey man, hey man, tell me where's the rave happening? - I don't know. - [Woman On Street] Do you know where we could get tickets? Sexy. (laughter) - [Man Looking For Rave] Whoa! - Parents that don't have the parenting control that they did when I was a kid. So they have these rave parties and it's all underground. They'll get dope. They'll pass out flyers. And they hold it in different locations. Maybe every week, every month, wherever they're going to do it, where they all get loaded with drugs. And the music is indicative of violence as well. Many of the times they'll bash each other. They'll fight with each other. And they'll actually flagellate themselves. - Basic difference (women laughing) I think between like, this generation and our generation (man grumbling) is the drugs, you know? Beause back then there was acid and mushrooms and psychedelics, and now, - There's coke and crank and everything's so. - But it's not to the extent now, I mean, it's not just, - So young, you know? (man hushes) - Like crack and crank and, you know, PCP. It's so much more deadly now. It's scary, you know, but I think that's what people like. I think just that living on the edge like that. (dramatic piano music) - I don't care, I'm a friend of lizard king. (man laughs) I don't care. - Now, of course, drugs are everywhere. The number one foreign policy of American government is drug policy. But, and now the attitudes towards death, I think the final taboo, maybe DNA is going to be the next one in about 30, 40 years. We start tinkering around with the DNA, but I don't even want to think about that. I've got enough trouble here, but death is the taboo and I'm going to explore this turf, and I'm going to hopefully send back messages as to what I find, and then I'll make a lot of mistakes. And the great thing about science is that people learn more from the mistakes than they do from the predictions that come true. ♪ Pink and blue, green and red ♪ ♪ All these colors running around my head ♪ ♪ On the table there's a head ♪ ♪ Oh my God, Tim Leary's dead ♪ (soulful guitar music) - The time has come for you to seek new levels of reality. Your ego and your name game are about to cease. You're about to be set face to face with The Clear Light. That was John Lennon. Yeah, told me that when he was taking LSD they read this to him. What bullshit is that about? About, you know, naked, spotless, intellect is like a transparent vacuum and he was right. Poetic babble. - [Interviewer] If you said to a mistake, for example, that, - You're never mystic for more than five, - [Interviewer] Five minutes. - Five minutes, yeah. - [Interviewer] But a man sitting on a mountain in a state of, of fasting. - That's bullshit. - That's bullshit? Total bullshit? - Well, people do that. I mean they climb, - They don't get the same consciousness, - They climb up flagpoles in America. - I don't think that Tim is really on a spiritual path actually, to tell you the truth. - I don't think he's a mystic. - [Interviewer] He's not a mystic? - I don't think so. - He's never had a spiritual teacher. He's never been able to take anybody as a spiritual teacher. - He's never done any real practices other than taking chemicals and thinking. - [Interviewer] Well, what about the idea that there's a unity beneath it all? Well, I say beneath, not beneath! It's around! You use the metaphor then of hierarchy. That what is what is beneath, see, you got to go up like that, see, the hierarchical mode is useful... - [Interviewer] Well, well, it's like the layers of an onion, what's inside the onion, - Oh, so now the human soul's like an onion! Ha ha ha! (clapping) Well, that's wonderful. 50 billion years, we've evolved to have brains like onions, with all these things we peel off, (laughter) I'm getting hungry. (laughter) Let's have sliced brains and mushrooms, I'm being silly, but why not? (old time parade music) - If you're going to freeze after clinical death, it seems to meet your freezing meat. - [Interviewer] What happens if we're contacted by extra terrestrials? What's the scenario then? Well, if we're contacted by extraterrestrials, of course, number one, who knows? And it raises some interesting questions. Why would a self-respecting species on some star system up there that has evolved to the extent they can package bodies, send them 20 million light years. Why would they come to a small little swampy planet like this? It's the third stone from the sun. And we're way out. It kinda boggles my mind. You know, a lot of the lovely middle-aged ladies in the Midwest are talking about being abducted and sexually molested by extraterrestrials. Why would an intelligent space person come all the way down to Iowa and kidnap a 70 year old grandmother to, to abuse her sexually? I mean, it boggles my mind. (laughter) - [Interviewer] To take her DNA. To play with it. (laughter) But, yeah, that's something else, yeah. They don't have to fuck her though. (woman screams) But she wants to be fucked, right? (woman screaming) (old timey parade music) (woman laughs) - You know a fried egg? Your brain is like fried egg? - Yeah, yeah. (laughter) Over easy, lightly. (laughter) Over easy, lightly. - Scrambled? So would your brain be fried or poached? Boiled? - Fresh. - Fresh. - Country fresh. (soulful music) - In August, all this terrible stuff happened. The first thing was that we got the news that Jerry Garcia had died, you know? And then I got the news Leary is dying. And I'm like, oh my God, this is so terrible. I just felt really hammered. And then somewhere I saw a news item that said, Leary says, he's thrilled that he's dying. First, it was just like a smack in the face. And then after about one second, I just went, thank God for this man. Here's the guy who's a public figure who is wise. He's seen through, he's lived a long life. He's done so many great things, he's going "I'm dying." "I'm excited." "What do you think is out there, you know?" "I'm going to get to find out." (laughter) (relaxing guitar music) - Well, you know, there was in seventies, this very popular Moody Blues song, and there was a line in it, Timothy Leary's dead. And I was very surprised when I found out that Timothy Leary really hates that line, just grates on him. And I guess it's because he felt that somehow he was over with, he was done with, and of course he wasn't, he recreated himself and, and reinvented himself with a cyberpunk and as a futurist. ♪ Timothy Leary's dead ♪ ♪ No, no, he's outside ♪ ♪ Looking in ♪ - I don't basically care whether I come back again or not. I've lived the most exciting life of anyone I know of, and I wouldn't mind a few million years just sacking out. - With this cryonic capsule. We shall freeze ourselves and reawaken 40 years in the future. - Ye gad, Brain! What will we do in the future? - I don't know yet, Pinky, but it has to be better than what we're doing now. - Timothy said a few years ago that getting your, that having yourself cryonically frozen was the second stupidest idea he'd ever heard. Letting the worms get you was the first stupidest idea. - The brain simply needs a very small number of, of chemicals like oxygen and calcium. I'm going to find exactly what the brain needs because the most exciting moment in my life, and I think could be for any of our lives, the time when your heart stops beating, boom, your body's gone, but your brain can usually stay alive for two to five minutes, and it's possible to keep your brain alive for more time. And that, that unknown territory between the end of the body and the final hookup of the brain is the most exciting turf, terrain, period, I think, in life because of, we all want to know what's going to happen. - From the very beginning, I have told the cryonics people, starting with Robert Edinger who founded the movement in 1964, that it was impossible to freeze anybody at the present time or their head at the present time and bring them back sometime in the future. That's zero possibility. - I am keeping my "soul" alive through cryonics, freezing my brain, possibly freezing my body. They're going to be at least 50 or more, little vials around the world with my blood so that they can go in and do a DNA resuscitation. - [Journalist] Do you have any sense that when he might want to wake up, you know, some, some point in time, is there, does he have a favorite kind of scenario? - Not, not during a Republican administration. (fast paced piano music) - [Interviewer] He thinks that he can be brought back in maybe a hundred or a thousand years. - If you had just paid so much to have your brain frozen, wouldn't you? - If I were to freeze this brain today, bruising it with dimethyl sulphoxide and ringer solution say 15% DMSO, you would have a perfectly preserved brain a thousand years from now, but there'd be no possibility of bringing this brain back. And I told Leary several times over the years, knowing that he wanted to have cryogenic preservation of his head, I says, well, I just don't think that it will ever be possible for you to be brought back. - In some way, Timothy identifies with his thinking brain and assumes that that vehicle is a very highly articulated and evolved vehicle that has carried a lot of information here. And there will come a time when technology will allow him to retain his "himness" the way he knows himself through this constellation of biochemical circuitry and function in maybe a nice solution or maybe in somebody, in a body of a young somebody or other, and do it all over again with, with Timothy's brain, you know, and Timothy will say, wow, here I am in this. You know, he sort of like changing from a Ford, you know, and then buying a new car. - The concept of the human body as a car and that the human brain or the soul uses it drive around, that's, that's Buddhism, that's Hinduism! That's the fact that the body's a vehicle to take your brain around where your brain wants you to go. - I don't know anybody else in the world that can move in and out of their body like you though. You actually were moving in and out of your body. - Well, anyone that's ever had a hallucinogenic experience or anyone that's taken any good dope. (laughter) Come on. - So you're referring to like, - 30 million people that right now in America, that they get home and they take a toke. - Turn on the ignition and, - Wow, vroom! - Going around the block a few times. - Clear the runway, I'm taking off, vroom! - I hope that Timothy Leary, if he's reconstituted in the future, will be just as much of a troublemaker, as he wasn't in this century. I love him for that. I forgive everything else for that, because, it's beautiful to be a troublemaker in this century because it's a very troubled century. - If we pay him, if there is an inducement of any kind, any, any payment, any check that we pay him, then they could argue that we paid Leary an inducement for him to commit suicide on camera. Paul, are you there? The felony murder rule. - I mean, this is, this is like Kevorkian. - [Zach] Hey. Isn't it? - [Zach] How're you doing? - Hey Zack, welcome. He's in Michigan. - Is someone going to take care of the taxi? - [Todd Mills] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, here, could you just, - He's going to come back for me too. - [Todd Mills] Let's see, how much is it, do you know? - It's $40. - [Paul Davids] They all have, they all have legal culpability, don't they? - I need a 20 bucks, for the cab driver. - Right. - Are you guys accomplices? Are you murderers? - [Todd Mills] Well, there's going to be an attending physician. - Yes. - So he's going to be highly compromised if he's involved in the, he's going to be on camera. - Correct. - Is it going to be Kevorkian? - No. - It's a physician that doesn't mind showing his face doing this, and, you know, potentially jeopardizing his license to practice medicine? - Yes. - Is he going to do the neurological style or the full body? - Neurological. - So that means his head - Head. Has to be moved. - Head, right. - Head and spine? - No, just head. - They don't remove the spinal cord? - I mean, just the bottom, the bottom of the vertebrae. Yeah, just from here, the neck up. - It's the back of the neck. - Mm hm. (Old time jazz music) - See, quantum physics gave us the real term to describe what happens when you take a, a powerful psychedelic plant or drug. Chaos, chaos, everyone, all the physicists say now chaos is the basic nature of the universe. Chaos of course is extreme complexity that the human mind can't understand right now. And the fun of existence is to keep taking different pieces of the chaos and learning how to deal with the chaos. You can't change it but you can surf it. I like the idea of surfing the waves of chaos. (electronic noises) ♪ I'm surfing the chaos ♪ ♪ Riding the wave in my mind ♪ ♪ Surfing the chaos ♪ ♪ It's spring cleaning time ♪ Sugar cubes ain't for babies, Mr. Natural blows my mind ♪ I ain't seen a better sunset ♪ ♪ Since I dropped some orange sunshine ♪ - We're all fucking confused I'm fucking confused, man. We're confused! I'm so fucking confused, man. It's all chaos. Please, man, I'm surfing the chaos like you told me to, I can't handle it no more. Don't leave me now. Don't die on us. Don't die on us. Don't die on us. (peaceful piano music) - [Interviewer] Negative LSD Takes Users on Trip to Nowhere. But if you read it right, it's "Now Here." (laughter) - If you extricate yourself from the structures of your own mind, you really are, I guess, surfing with chaos. I guess that's one way of looking at it. (birds chirping) (soulful guitar music) - Well, there's the terrible sadness that you feel. And then, In the case of my daughter, she wanted to have her organs donated so that there was a lot of midnight paperwork. Because it was a Catholic hospital, and Catholic hospitals don't like anything that allows the individual to decide. The Catholic Church is against birth control, it's against abortion, it's against even donating your organs. They belong God. And so it took a lot of time to, I don't know if this answers your question, but it's a deeply moving experience. Didn't he make it sound like I have cancer of the leg? And of course it's gonna be, they're gonna have to take a bunch of skin off of my leg here and put it over here. I won't be able to walk for what, a couple days? (peaceful piano music) There are probably a billion human beings, that would love to watch me die as slowly and as painfully as possible. All of them Republicans and Communists. - [Todd Mills] Would you like to record that for posterity? - What, what? - [Interviewer] Would you like to record that for the future? - Record what? - Your death. I mean, you've always said, - I've just explained to you, my death, it's going to be recorded, it's going to be, yeah, it's going to be, probably on the world wide web. - [Todd Mills] Oh, live? (laughter) - Part of the time, (laughter) I can't - Part of the time. - It's going to start off live and with any luck we'll have a final cut. (laughter) They can move on to a post production.

We're going to apply the algenate first, once that sets up, which just takes a few moments, we're going to apply plaster bandage, which is what broken bones are cast with, which is a rigid material, the algenate is soft. - [Timothy Leary] Oh, that's my, oh, my favorite. That's a greatest scene in movie history, I love that. My boyfriend in Macardo said you're supposed to take care of me and do what I tell you to do? See that, I want to dance. I wanted to win that dance with you. And I want that cup, got it? Just like, what a scene! - [Head Caster] So you'll only be under for about 15 or 20 minutes at the very most. (soothing piano music) Great, just relax. - [Timothy Leary] A new experience, I'll tell you. I've been to some of the most expensive whorehouses in Bombay and Calcutta but nothing like this. - [Head Caster] Nothing compares to this. - [Timothy Leary] Do you use plastic caulking? - [Head Caster] Well no, were not caulk specialists, but, - You know the plastic cock, uh, - [Head Caster] Caulking? - In the 1960s, there was a bunch of, - [Assistant Caster] Plaster casters? - Yeah. - Oh the plaster casters! I know of them, yes. - [Interviewer] Hendrix was a caster? - [Timothy Leary] Yeah, well, you had all these rock stars. I won't name their names. But white ones, but when (indistinct) Hendrix was like this. (laughter) - [Interviewer] You look like the mummy. This is so fantastic, wow. (men mumble to one another) - [Head Caster] 92 wives. Ramses the Third had 3000. (Timothy grunts in surprise) Probably about four minutes. - [Assistant Caster] That set up on you? - [Head Caster] Set up will be about two more minutes. And then we'll try to take it off. Thank you very much. Give us some resistance, you can kinda pull yourself out. Pull back against it. Here it comes, slowly, easy. (Timothy grunts) Rebirth. Reanimation. Very nice, how are you? - Woo ahhh. - Perfect, now we can clean you up.

(choking noise) Cut, cut! (laughter)
