Yoshizaki can't bury your past. Please let me go. Hoshina-san, I want to let go of you. Go out with me for one last day. If you really want to run away, then kill me. Hoshina-san, you won't change, will you? I want to die... What is this... Here you go~ Ah, hey. The one who sent this. Was it you? What is that? No... it's fine. Hoshina-san, this is far enough for me... This will be the end. Long time no see. Ichinose-san... Can I talk to you for just a minute? Thi- thi- thi- thi- thi-... Third! Thi- thi- thi-... Third! Third! Third~! Third~ Third! Third! Thanks~ Yes, okay. No, no! Please properly read it. Look here. This is a little lacking. And here. This last part where the character's hitting him. Aah... Okay. No, please don't give her such a bad name. It's about... Ogawa-san, isn't it? Did you two get in a fight? Okay, got it! Let's change the mood and go on a group date! Okay! A strategy meeting! Then our members are Yoshizaki-san and Ogawa-san. Then me and Narikawa-sensei. Come on, come on. Did something happen between you and Ogawa-san? She went out with Hoshina-san together. Ah, so it was them after all... Ogawa-san? Well, it might have been about work. What if you just asked her honestly about it? We didn't exactly... talk about it. Yoshizaki-san! Yes? -Saying, "we didn't exactly talk about it..." Please don't say such sad things. On top of that, are you two even dating!? Eh... If you don't say what you want to say, and if you don't properly get your feelings across, they'll immediately get misplaced. What are you talking about... I'm sorry. My own love life is going smoothly too. He hasn't replied since yesterday. Maybe Yoshizaki-san's busy... Sorry for coming so late. I'll make some tea. It's okay. I'll be leaving soon anyways. Yoshizaki-san? Yesterday... what were you doing? Eh... Eh, umm... Ah... yes- Yesterday I- -Went to Hoshina-san's place, right? I heard from someone. You finally came out~ Umm... I only went because I had to discuss something with Hoshina-san. About? It was something you had to meet to discuss right away? I'm really sorry. You lied about work. And you met another guy. Just what about you Kyouko should I believe? But there's nothing going on with Hoshina-san anymore... You keep saying nothing going on, nothing going, but there is! Walking out in your underwear... Meeting him alone on your day off... No matter how I think about it, it's weird! What you say and what you do are completely messed up! Yes... We're going out, aren't we? Yes. If that's the case, then why- Ho- Hoshina-san is someone I don't particularly like or hate. That's not what I mean umm... U- until now, even though I wanted to let him go, I couldn't but- No, I'm not exactly mad. How can I put it... I said this before, but when you want to talk, it would've been nice if you could talk to me... Actually... I'm jealous. More like... I don't know what's going on in my head. I've always... Even though I want to let him go but can't, it's because... Hoshina-san was the first person... to accept me for who I was. Accept you for who you are? I... Ever since I was a kid, I never had a place where I belonged, even at home or at school. Wrong! Isn't it supposed to be an F sharp there? Ye... ye- yes. Change with Naoko. Nao-chan. Aren't you a little too cold to just Kyouko? It's because when I look at her attitude, it just pisses me off. I don't think she's as youthful or cute as Naoko. She's like a ghost, so I didn't recognize her. What's wrong, Kyodoko? Just disappear! She already disappeared! Li- literature department freshman. I'm Ogawa... Kyouko. I act a little weird, so they call me Kyodoko. Okay! Economics department freshman. I'm Nanase Kouhei! From Kyouko... It becomes Kyodoko? It's funny. That's when I first met Hoshina-san. But... And well... when I wanted to move forward and let him go, I went to tell him that I didn't want him to associate with me anymore. To lead to such misunderstandings, I apologize. What is it like now with that mother? Well... it's been many years since we've talked. Is leaving your relationship with your mother like that okay? Unless you overcome that, when something painful happens again, you'll remember your past, and won't you just return to Hoshina-san? It's exactly as Yoshizaki-san says... I can't... continue like this. Umm... -Yes? Tomorrow... I'd like to request the day off. That's okay. It's only natural to take paid time off after all. Thank you very much! Power harassment and sexual harassment is bad isn't it~ Did something happen? -Oga-chan, e-mail! E-mail! Hoshina-san was that kind of person. -Power harassment... Sexual harassment? A lowlife... -Damn! What is this... Poisonous fang?... -Eeh? How awful... Please don't redistribute these subs without asking for permission first! Enjoy! Translations by animeswordmaster @d-addicts I appreciate all of your achievements until now, but against this accusation, it doesn't matter if this is someone's mischief. As a company, it is my duty to deal with this. Please consider filing for an investigation in the near future. Yes. What do you think? Any ideas? The sexual harassment and power harassment are completely groundless. Good work. Kyodoko. Ah... It's not from me. The e-mail. I already knew that. Even though it's Kyodoko's fault, there's no way you could have done it, right? Emi-san... is ignoring me. See... It won't change to "Read." TL Note: His chat message status. Isn't she busy? Hmm~ I see~ I see... My rally ran late, so it turned into the length of like a scrolling and scrolling essay. Hey, that's way too long, isn't it? Ah, I got it. Yoshizaki-san, what kind of messages do you send to your girlfriend? Wa- wa- wai- wai- wait... -Be quiet! We're at an izakaya. Be quiet. Ah! -Eh, no, you're wrong... Hotta-san. Yes? -Ah, Yoshizaki-kun? Am I not good enough? -Stop it! A beer please. Okay. No matter what, I can't give up on Hoshina-san. When I'm alone, I can only think about Hoshina-san... That guy isn't worth it. Hoshina's been a bad guy for a long time. Not just with his personality. His looks too. Eh? That guy's had plastic surgery done. Freakin' Hoshina! When we were kids, he was bullied all the time. When I think about it, the current Hoshina is like a miracle. Our bad. We didn't see you since you were in the back. We really couldn't see ya! Our bad! Ever since I was little, I didn't have a place where I belonged, even at home or at school. You piece of shit! I'm sorry, father! You're ugly and you're dumb! I wonder who you resemble! Whenever we went to the department store, we'd always take the way by the pet shop. Mother would always stare at the cats. She'd smile with a happy look on her face. You went back to that pet shop again? I didn't... What are you saying? Don't keep underestimating me. My face? It can change? Even though I say it can change, it's just a little. Like your eyes or your nose. Ren, please. Will you do what your mother asks? You... really resemble the person that your father hates. As your mother, I can't watch him put you through anymore pain. Please! Don't cry, mother. It's okay. Even if I change. Sorry... The real him... isn't around anymore. Like sexual harassment? And power harassment? Hoshina-san did!? -Yep. An open investigation committee has been opened already. In the end, that guy was someone on the other side like I thought. Was the power harassment victim about Kyouko? No, no. They even wrote about things that happened before he came to our company. I don't think it was just Oga-chan. What's going on... Even during that time at the exhibition. It also seems like he made Kyouko walk out wearing underwear. Eh, so that really was the case? -Eh, really? It's strange. Both the victim and the perpetrator. Hmm~... He went that far, huh. How was Kyouko at work? Eh? -Well... Yesterday, I think I might have said too much. Eeh!? A fight!? -Eeh!? No, no. I REALLY thought it through! I was desperate. However... doesn't there have to be a limit? Come on now. Don't talk like that. Yoshizaki-kun, you're the only one who can save Oga-chan. Even I.... thought that I could be the bright one to pull her out. When I realized it, I fell into the darkness. I guess it's all too much baggage for me~ Probably right now, she's desperately trying to change, so just hang on a little longer, okay? -Okay? Yoshizaki-san, good morning. I took a day off today. I'm going home for the first time in 5 years to talk to my mother. I'm going to hit her with everything I couldn't say until now. Also, I no longer want to be tied up with either my mother or Hoshina-san anymore. I'll become a new me, and come meet you, Yoshizaki-san. Yoshizaki-san, Narikawa-sensei's here to see you. Eh, me? -Yes, for my next work, I'd like for you Kou-chan to be in charge of it. Eh... But what about the current person in charge... On top of that, I'm just a manga editor. Before, when I asked you for advice, that's when I knew it. That in order to overtake my current work, I need you, Kou-chan. Of course, you're still in charge of Suzuki-sensei, so I was going to speak to the company as well... What do you think? Sorry... Right now, I'm busy as a manga editor, and it's an important time for Suzuki-sensei... I see... Then like before, I'll have you read it first, then- Let's stop that too. To be honest... I don't want to keep meeting like this with just the two of us. Your girlfriend is important to you, isn't she? She's someone who I can't meet eye-to-eye with unless we face each other properly. I see... Sorry, I have another meeting. I got dumped... Even though it's my own home... why is it so hard for me to go in? Who are you? Kyouko... Why'd you come all of a sudden? I ha- ha- ha- have something to talk to you about. Naoko is bringing her friends over now. Until that's over, can you leave? Why? Eh? Why do I have to leave? You ask why... T- to me... I'm a family member in this house. Mother, you were always cold to just me, weren't you. I'm home... I have a piano recital celebration. Big sis, you're not coming with us? Eh? Kyouko's not coming. Please take our messages while we're gone. Okay, let's go. Today's Salisbury steak, isn't it. I'm happy... This isn't something you need to be happy about. With that fucking fake smile, you really piss me off. Then I somehow had to leave. I didn't have a home to belong to... It was painful. Why now? It's history, isn't it? I really ha- hated it. You're pissing me off! When I or other people see you, they think so too. That's why in order for you to not get hated, I went out of my way to teach you everything! What? You want me to apologize for that? Be- because you're my parent... Because I'm human... whether you like me or not, there's nothing I can do. But I'm also human! Sorry, I was a failure at raising you- Shut up! I... am still talking. It's okay... if you hate me. But I wanted you to at least pretend to be a parent to me. Since I was little, I've always known. However, I'm moving forward. Because I'm no longer who I was in the past. That's all I came to say. I said it! Hoshina-san! I also like your old face. I heard from Makimura-san. About your childhood, Hoshina-san. That guy's also a chatterbox, huh. For example, no matter what kind of past you had, I'm fine with it. I intend to take in everything about you, Hoshina-san. That's why please once more, won't you consider looking at me again? You just won't shut up, will ya? I won't leave you alone again, Hoshina-san. Because I will always be by your side! Always? -Yes... Always. Ya shouldn't say such irresponsible things. What did you come here to do? Huh? You know, my uncle's company's newly manufactured material E-Prox. I brought a sample... I don't need something like that. Eh... You'll understand what will happen if there's any more questions on my head, don't you? Hoshina-san... Did you not love me at all? I said this before. I get excited by having loveless sex. That hurts... Please stop. Stop! Next up is gonna be meeting with the Public Relations department. Okay, how about Monday? I'm free. -Me too. I'm fine if it's in the afternoon. Okay, good work. Thanks for the good work~ Ah, Oga-chan, isn't today your birthday? Eh!? -It is. Did you remember it? My smartphone did. -Happy birthday~ Thank you very much! -Then today, you're going on a date with Yoshizaki-kun? Ah, I was thinking of contacting him after this... All lovey-dovey~ Ah, there's a hearing after this, isn't there? Everyone is divided up and individually be questioned about Hoshina-san. Can you say what you want to say? You won't be threatened by Hoshina-san? No, I'll be fine. Well, when the time comes, I'll lay on some cover fire for you. Laying on cover fire is blowing this way out of proportion! The other day, a company-wide e-mail was sent. After that mail was sent, we looked into it, and from our parent company Teikou Trading, we now know that it was sent from one of their business computers. Teikou Trading... Hoshina-san's old place, huh. It sounds like this all stemmed from someone's grudge from long ago. According to the Human Resources Department, this mail concerns a company employee. Due to the potential that this could also be an insider's accusation, all company employees will undergo a hearing investigation. In the Materials Room, I saw Hoshina-san pull in a woman and hug her. Do you remember who the woman was? No, I couldn't see her. Can I say something? Please. She's planning on covering up for him. -Seriously... We can hear you. Ichinose-san, who was transferred back to the main branch, once sexually harassed me, but in order to pin it on Ichinose-san, Hoshina-san fabricated that lie, so that was not what really happened. Instead, from Hoshina-san, I've endured countless sexual harassment advances. I brought this evidence with me. Iida, what are you planning? You know, my uncle's company's newly manufactured material E-Prox. I brought a sample... I don't need something like that. -Eh... You'll understand what will happen if there's any more questions on my head, don't you? Hoshina-san... Did you not love me at all? I said this before. I get excited by having loveless sex. That hurts... Please stop. Stop! That is all. It was all one-sided, wasn't it? Yes. Hoshina-san, you really did it this time. No, no, no, no... There was... love, wasn't there? Continuing on, Ogawa-san. Ah... Yes. Earlier this year, at our new product launch exhibition, you suddenly walked out onto the runway, is that correct? Yes. We have information that Hoshina-san is partly at fault for forcing it onto you. Is this true? Of course it is. -Oga-chan, stay strong. Is it true that he forced it onto you? No, it's not. Aah? I wasn't particularly forced into doing it. What are you saying, Oga-chan? -This one's an idiot. This last time, I walked forward of my own volition. Mm... That's why this is my problem. For real, what the hell. I can't believe this! Come on! Oga-chan! Why did you cover for Hoshina-san? It's not... umm... not like I was covering for him. Umm... at that time, It was definitely Hoshina-san who told me to walk out onto the runway though. See~ -See? I should have properly declined him at that time. Hey, Ogawa-san, did you know? Hoshina-san had plastic surgery done on him. The face you know is not his real face at all. I've completely graduated from him, but Ogawa-san, you still covered for him. You have some regrets, don't you? That's not the case. That's amazing. Do you plan to fall down into Hell with him? All of the accusations that were recently sent may not all be acts, but among them, there were some cases that are hard to overlook. We will contact you at a later date about this matter's results. Until then, it means you will be placed on house arrest. Yes sir. Ren-kun? How come you didn't pick up? It doesn't look like mother's health is looking good. That's why in regards to the treatment costs and hospital charges, this time- In the future, I do not want you to concern yourself over me. I don't want to be tied up with you anymore, Hoshina-san. Ever since day one, I don't think the day where we meet eye-to-eye will ever come! Yoshizaki-kun? -Um~ Umm... You said there'd be an internal investigation, so I was wondering how that turned out. Well, we still don't know the results from it. Yeah. It's just that Oga-chan... Actually... I'm sorry for having you rush this. Thank you very much. The necklace made it in time~ With this, I can now see Yoshizaki-san confidently. Come in. -Sorry I'm late. Umm, Yoshizaki-san. -Hm? I went to speak with my mother. Hm... How did it go? It wasn't like I wanted her to apologize for things in the past, so I don't think anything might change inside my mother but I feel so much better on the inside! Is that so... That's great. You said to say what I wanted, without hanging onto the past, and I realized I could move forward. My confidence... came back. Th- then... it's about Hoshina-san. Kyouko. -Yes? Well... Let's break up. Eh... Kyouko, you probably don't really love me. Eh? Eh... I lo- lo- love you. I love you, Yoshizaki-san. Eh... Why... Somewhere inside you Kyouko, Hoshina-san is still there. Even now. H- he's not. He's not there anymore! He is. Wh- Why are you saying such things? Even though I said he's not there... The only one I love is you, Yoshizaki-san. I heard you covered for him. For Hoshina-san... That... you did it so that his sentencing would be lighter. You're wrong. This is a problem between Hoshina-san and me. It- it's not our company's problem. Even if you say that, I don't... I don't know how I should think of it. Eh, umm... Kyouko, you don't want Hoshina-san to disappear. That's why you covered for him, right? And that's... maybe because you rely on him? Even if after this, we were to continue dating, it wouldn't be love. The person you would rely on wouldn't just change to me. That's why... Sorry. Umm... Yo- Yo- Yoshizaki-san. Sorry. On a day like today. And like this, my 28th birthday was... painful... and changed into a sad memory.
