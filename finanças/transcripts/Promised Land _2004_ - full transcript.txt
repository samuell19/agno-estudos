Put it in fire to get bigger. They like fire. It would be better if we were eating than sitting next to the fire. - Reminds of me the Black Sea. - It doesn?t smell that much. They told me not to go to Egypt. I don?t feel safe here. They came from Egypt. I sold them all. Fifty. Why is it so cold at Sinai? Its southern than USSR. I'll sell her too. They came from Cairo or Port Said. Look at this girl. She's very pretty. Silence, they're talking about us. Give me a cigarette. She's a doll. She worth 2 thousand. She worth 13,000. Maybe more. Like my father used to say... "'Whoever doesn?t open the scene? Is at the worst situation. " 1.000 pounds. And she worth 7.000. She's a doll. She's freezing. You want me to warm her up? Its cloudy. Its going to rain soon. Do they think they're on vacation? Its cold here. We are still far away from the Israel borders. The last time the soldiers didn't bother. Egyptians or Israelis?

This way! Come! All right. Leave the bags and get naked! Igor, tell them.

Put off the towel. Girls... Prepare them. Igor, where is the make-up? Take it. If sharks were humans... they would build huge cages in the sea... and fill them up with goodies for the small fish... and they would keep them clean. Next. For example... If a fish got injured on the fin... they would put him a sticking immediately... so it won't die immediately, but stay alive... till it end up in sharks belly. Next. Stop crying. I cant put you make-up. Stop crying. Stop. I'll treat you good. Stop. I know... I also left the homeland years ago. I was born in Germany, near borders and I live there. I was doing really good there... I did what I wanted. I was doing shows. And then I fell in love with a Hebrew... but he didn't feel good in that country... and he wanted to go at Israel. I followed him. When you are in love, you follow your other half. No one can restrict you from loving him... Its like electric load. It creates a new world for both... But you have to load him, or you lose everything. Maybe if we had a child... That was it. We didn?t have a kid so we broke up. Then I met another one, Yussuf... He showed me a new life and I thought... I thought... that life is composed by many roads... that I wanted to discover. I didn?t know where they were going me. So... I don?t live with him anymore. But we are still collaborating. Simple collaboration. He got the north, I got the south. Like the Queen. - You remind me someone... - Who? I don't know. Must be my sister... - Stop crying. - I'm so scared. I want to calm you down. I'll be good with you. I want to be good. Stop crying. I don?t have much to give you. Only this maybe, which I like. Look what I?m going to give you. Here, take it. Its hard to give it to you. I cant put it out easily. Here you go. You're going to work for me all right? Imagine it as a job. Only as a job. Don't think you are a whore you're just working. I'll be always good with you. What happened to that girl? I think she died... maybe not. What are you looking at? Mind your business! - Listen to me! - I'm not interested. I'm not hitting on you. I only want to talk to you. Listen to me. - I'm not interested. - Only you can help me! You're the only one. I won't see you again. You've got to help me. We are eight girls. They brought us here without our willing. They hit us. We can't even breath, Listen to me. You've got to help me. You're the only one who can. Look at me! Imagine your sister here... and people touching her, and fucking her and she crying. - You have to help me. - How? I beg you, you'll think something. Take me from here. Help you to run away? Find money to pay someone. I won't see you again. I want you to come back... - Why are you telling me all that; - Only you can help me. Please. I can't do anything. I'm sorry. I have to go. Promise me you'll think about it. Come back. That?s what I?m asking. Its a foreign country, I can't speak the language. You'll think of something. Come back. I can't do anything. Only think about it. Who is that doll? She is kissing with passion. Look at Igor. He's in the mood. That was the club in Eilat. She was looking at us. She was there when Bedouins were selling us. - Maybe she wants to accompany us. - Maybe she likes to look. - She might help us. - I talked with her. She might help us. Help. Welcome to Haifa. Get lost. Are they all here? Bring them. Cover up with that. Rose, are you all right? Don't frown. - I didn't hear you. - I said, don't frown. Don?t frown? Here? You're so beautiful. Like an angel Are you sick? Physically, no. I'm all right. Get some rest... - Water... - Rain. It rains a lot here. All the time. I can't believe that this is winter. It's only raining. Whenever Igor hit the sack... I felt like he was hitting one of us again... and slowly we bowed to... and accepted to be things, statues or paintings. Yussuf and Hezi were fighting in a hebrew-arabic mixture. They only agreed when they were planning our future. For how they were going to use us. We were far away from the landscapes of our child years. Estonia looked far away. We were just waiting to finish, with one way or another. Come on Katya. Come. - That's Katya. - I know. - It's cold. - It's cold, damn it! Stop cursing, Katya. Everyone get out of here! You're disturbing our work! Get out of here! Now everything's all right. Now everything's all right. I'm free! Wait! Its time to reborn... Its time to bow... its time to get together... Time to love... Time to hate. Time for war... Time for peace. What?s the profit man has from all this work?
