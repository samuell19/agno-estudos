We are joined today in our studio by Dr. Jay Thapar. His company has just made a remarkable breakthrough on gene therapy which promises to make hunger a thing of the past. Dr. Thapar, good morning. Good morning. Your new drug promises to change the world. The time is right after years of trials and research, to make our drug available to everybody in the form of the new pesticide product Zacrid-3. Your clinical trials on Zacrid-3 have finished then? We are confident that Zacrid -3 will be able to tackle the world's problems with infection and crop loss. This drug you have created, which is made from a crossing of mammalian and plant DNA, could cause all sorts of problems don't you think? We simply don't know what genetic manipulation will do in the long run. And the trials have only been conducted over a two year period hardly very long, wouldn't you say? Our drug promises to feed the world by destroying the pests and diseases that wipe out crops and livelihoods. Is it true that farmers are being forced to buy this product? That the land your company owns is leased to many subsistence farmers that have no choice as to whether to use Zacrid-3 or not? We are helping those farmers by providing them with a means to feed their families. And how did you make this discovery? Our research took us in a totally different direction. We stumbled upon this wonder drug that attacks plant predators at a genetic level giving them a pathogen that wipes them out swiftly and completely. A Swiss competitor has re-created your drug and claims that your drug creates a pathogen that can jump species. Absolutely not! We've tested that and it's not true. There is no evidence to suggest that Zacrid-3 is harmful to environment or other species. But what about the ethics of this work? People are starving there's a time for ethics. (Traffic noise, people.) Do you want to kill your wife and children? Leave my family out of this. Stop experimenting, stop messing about with nature. (Coughing) Zack: What time are you finishing tonight? Jane: I'm on a late again, Zack. You should tell your boss you need a break. It's Zero Hours contract, I have to take what I can get. It just makes me sick. Yeah, I know... (Sirens blaring) (Coughing) Jane, are you all right? Jane, speak to me, what's going on? Jane! What the fuck? (Zombie growling) JANE! (Coughing) (Coughing, spluttering) (Zombie growls) (Eating sounds, chewing, slurping) (Zombie growls) (Boy screams) (Bird song) (Bike pedaling) (Elephant trumpets) (Elephant trumpets) (Buzzing flies) (BANGING!) (Zombie growling) (Car revving) (Zombies screaming) (Heavy breathing) (Sniffing) (Zombie screeches) (Winding of gears) (BANG!) (Zombie yell) Help me! (Zombie screams) Don't make a sound! Who are you? James. How long have I been here? Two days. Where? You're safe. Where? Coventry. What were you doing, stripping me and washing me like that? You were dirty and you needed medical attention. You'd no right. James: Saving you? James: What's your name? Tommy. Tommy Shields. Put the knife down, Tommy. Is that yours? We've been through a lot together. How long have you been here? A few months. I stumbled upon it. And then I thought there was safety in hiding in plain sight. Is this all the food you've got? I've raided most of the houses nearby. I don't like to wander too far. Safety in numbers. Why's your hair so quaffed? I was in Birmingham when it all ended. I worked in a bank. I was walking home, and I must have passed out because the next thing I knew I woke up in this commune. The Village they called it. Where? It was somewhere this side of Birmingham. I don't know exactly. It was walled. And they had people doing absolutely everything Butchers, bakers, bread makers, barbers, you name, they'd got it. Where's it near? I don't know. I was taken there unconscious. Can we find it? I disobeyed the fella in charge, Joshua. The boss, he called himself. Right bastard. They called the infected, 'deadheads'. I wanted to leave and go home. He wouldn't let me. So, he had me clubbed and dumped. It's what you get for going against him. My wife and son are in Kenilworth. (Zombie screams) (Zombie moaning) I want to go and find my wife and son. They're dead. And it's too risky. You don't know that. Let me tell you what is also risky me saving you, bringing you here, giving you my food and you making me feel unsafe. So, if you don't like it, leave. Go! Go tomorrow. You can't throw me out. My house, my place, my rules. If you don't like it go! Where? Start with Kenilworth. When the virus hit ninety percent of the population were wiped out. And all that was left was, was those things. So, if you want to go, knock yourself out. But count me out of it. Where are you going? Stop making so much noise. We'll leave first thing in the morning. It's too late to go now. Have you killed anyone? Only deadheads. I can't face tinned food tonight. Not knowing that's in the garden. They made a really great stew in the village. It was built around a dairy farm. James: Putting the oven on will drain the generator. And to cook that bird it'll take a lot of power. And the deadheads are drawn by the smell of blood. Ring its neck. Does the oven work? There's enough fuel to turn it on. And to cook a meal? It would be our last one. Can we get some more fuel from somewhere? There's a garage nearby but there's a nest of deadheads living in it. And it's too dangerous. One last hot meal then. What happened at the Village? I couldn't forget my wife and son. So, I tried to escape. But they had an armed guard. And I was shot at. Next thing I know, I'm here with you. They dumped you in the middle of Coventry. I wasn't there problem any more. No one questions Joshua and lives. You've been bitten but you haven't turned. Could you find the Village again? Maybe. But we wouldn't be welcome. Joshua doesn't like strangers. James: Just to live in a place where I didn't have to hunt or look for food again. Once we've killed it, then what? Don't worry, I know what to do, my mother showed me. I was saving these for a special occasion. So, cheers. Tommy: Cheers. Tommy: Who have you killed? Does it matter? Yes. My other half. What was her name? Boyfriend. Queer? As a Coote. But don't worry, you're not my type. We were living in Leeds. He had just qualified as a lawyer when the virus hit. James: He was younger than me. How long had you been together? Four years. So, why Coventry? I don't know. I'd been out there for months. Walking around. An accident. Too lazy to move on. Family? Dead. (Zombie moaning) What month is it? James: August. Tommy: August the what? James: 15th. Tommy: It was my son's birthday last week. (Creaking door) (Creaking door) It's my brother. Thank god! (Zombie scream) Tommy: Scott. Please. I'm your Dad. I'm your Dad. NO! Kill him. I can't. You can't leave him like that, kill him. I can't. (Zombie scream) Get on your bike. (Zombie scream) They can't come out in the day. (BANG!) (Zombie screams) We can't stay here. It's not safe. No where is. Wait! It's over. I'm not giving up. What about me? Stay if you like. Don't leave me. Don't ask me to stay. I don't want to be alone. You're not. Where will we go? We'll look for the village. Can you remember where it is? We'll head in that direction. Birmingham? It's, it's miles away. It's something to aim for. It's too risky to be out in the dark. It's too risky to stay here. We'll find another house. Tommy: Can't we walk round? James: It's quicker. James: It will take two days to reach Birmingham as it is. (Zombie moans) (Zombie scream) (Bottle falling) (Zombie screaming) Any chance of a drink? How long have you been here? Long enough. Joshua? (Clanking of chains) Don't you love how it is now? It's all finished. Gone. All that stupid meaningless crap. Buying stuff you didn't need or want. Chasing your tail, jumping for the big man. Gone. None of it means anything any more. (Chains clanking) None of it. Just the clothes on your back and the food in your mouth. That's it. And it's more real. No money, no jobs, no work. You can keep it all. Shove it all up your arse. It never worked. And now, the deadheads have inherited the world. (Chains clanking) Let them have it. They deserve it. Running around, eating whatever comes in their way. They're the new super predator now, not us. Deadheads. We had a shop. A real... community thing. In a street corner. I beat my mother to death, stabbed my sister and watched my dad choke on his own bloodied spit curled up under the counter in the shop. What prepares you for life? Death. Clears the head. Puts it all into perspective. Don't talk so loudly. This is my house. Have as much fun as you like. They'll hear you. Who? I killed them all. They're all dead. Everyone. They can't hear you. And the dead don't speak. Long days. No holidays. Hard work. Now life's one long holiday. No chance of a drink then? SHUT UP! I'll blow his face off. What would happen if I killed him? You? Nothing. You both dead no consequences. No one to care. And something for me to eat. Please don't. Why's he so important to you? Why's anything important any more? Who cares? Who'd care? Who'll care? No one. It's all gone. Finished. Dead. We should all be dead. The end of the world and no one to film it, tweet it or twat it. Joshua: All that time wasted on what? Joshua: Money making! Joshua: Bill churning anxiety Joshua: about a future that never came. Just dust. That's what we'll become Dead! Dead! Dead! The gunshot will lead the deadheads to us. So? There's nothing to live for. (BANG!) (GUNSHOT) Stay here. We'll be back. (Zombie moans) Run! Run! (ROARING) RUN! James: I've found the way out. Are you sure you won't stay with us? My brother might be alive. He might not be. He lives in Leicester. The opposite direction to Birmingham. Ok. Well, you have enough water for three days. Thank you. We should stick together. Perhaps. Ok. You should be careful during daylight, some of the infected are becoming immune. I never liked Earl Grey. It could do with some milk. Put your money in the tin. To you... To the future of mankind. I haven't slept well in months. And even now with you, I can't doze off. Relax. James: Will I ever sleep again? James: You don't know anything about me. But I feel closer to you than I have to anyone else ever before in my life. I was a carpenter. And this was my hammer. I made chairs, tables, stools. And what do I use this hammer for now? What have I used it for? I wasn't rich. And now everyone's come down to my level. That house I was hiding in was the nicest place I'd ever lived. (CRASH) James: Screaming! (GUNSHOT) James: Growling. James: Keep away. James: Keep away before I turn. In the Village there was this fella who knew about astronomy and stuff. He said we can see more stars now than at any other time in the last one hundred years. No smoke, no jet planes churning up the sky. I guess that's why we can see so many shooting stars. They're not stars. No? Nor meteors. They're satellites. Satellites? Cut from communication, no course correction soon enough they'll all come down. Come home. This time tomorrow we'll be in Birmingham. Scott. Scott. (Zombie moaning) (Zombie moaning) (Zombie screams) (Zombie screams) (Zombie screams)
