Darling, wake up. Did you wash your hands? -I did, get off my case. Eat quickly. I don't have time. But I called you several times. What am I supposed to do? Where are you going? -Hong Kong. Wow, great. Nothing great, just work. When are you coming back? Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It depends on the work. Right. Dealing with complaints is always a hassle. Especially with this state-owned business. These guys don't negotiate. If I don't succeed we could be fined millions. Millions? Dear, you have to give me this month's allowance. And I need a little more. Prices are going up. Postcards, beer, butter... and Kenichi has an exam next year. How much is the old man paying monthly? Raise his rent. We're doing his laundry too. Konosuke, the taxi is here. Have a nice trip. Mom, mind the steps. Elderly easily fall. Are you okay? Thank you. Father, breakfast. Mom. How much does Dad give you every month? Kids aren't supposed to ask such questions. But you pay for my allowance on it, right? I'm concerned. For example at the Yoshida’s, their mom is holding the money. She gives the father his allowance every month. Why don't we do like that? I don't know, it's always been that way. Maybe because your grandparents did it too. Right, Mother? I was fine with just getting living expenses. Managing the family finances is such a drag. So I left it to your grandfather. Right. That's why Grandpa is so stingy. He heard you. What did you say about me? Dear, What are your plans today? I'll play golf with Kakuta. Great, I'm going to the cultural center. The literary meeting of the old girls. It’s great. Your grandfather is so sarcastic. What is that cultural center about? It's a place to study, there are many classes. Haiku, painting, yoga, social dance class, etc... even a hula dance class. Mom you should go too. I would choose a dance class. Mom, you can dance? In high school, I was in the flamenco club. What's so funny? They have a flamenco class too there. You should go. I told dad last year. I asked for some extra money. And so? He didn't want. He said, "Seriously, at your age?". It's awful, like father, like son. Good morning. -Thank you for the ride. Hello Hirata. Ready to go. You're so kind to pick him up. She's the reason I lost my driver’s license. What a pain... and I totally approve. This guy was a killer on the road. You saved people's lives. Idiot. Such a tiny car. -I use it to pick up my grandson at school. Hello. -I'm officer Nakamura from the Aoba Station. Mr. officer, I'm coming. Back to your cage. Good morning, What is it? There's been burglaries lately. It's scary... and I have to leave the house. In this area many people don't go out... especially there are elderly who stay home alone. Mr. officer, are you from Kansai? How did you guess? It's obvious. -Still single? It's not easy to talk to women in Tokyo. I'll make an old bachelor. Oh, come on. Sorry, I gotta go. "What can I do..." He’s so cute. -Goodbye, Mrs. Hinata. Where are you going? To work, at Nikotama. A stylish shop and the manager is so handsome. I have to build up my secret savings. "Marriage is advisable sometimes... but if you can do without... then better refrain." Said Hatsunosuke. This text is fascinating right from the start. When marriage doesn't feel right... you can refrain. This very pertinent observation... would greatly profit our modern youth. Still, you professor... just married your third wife. But this time, she is the right one. Is your present marriage happy? Don't push me too far. Do you ladies come here to torture me? I am sorry. Hayashi Fumiko, wrote this novel... what part left you with the strongest impression? Yes. -Yes. I liked when Michio was ironing. That's great, right? So imaginative. The iron is still warm... enough for two or three clothes. Michio thought this heat couldn't be wasted... and so she unzipped... the gray wool skirt she was wearing. Slipped out of it. The small, white silk slip... tightly coiled around her calf. Was it because it was spring? It felt good. Bringing the skirt to her face... she smelled a scent of sweat. What do you think about this passage? Doesn't it give you a shiver. Come on professor, at your age. We understand why you had so many wives. Take a break. Hello. Basement floor, flamenco class. Are you visiting? -Yes. Please. Your wife brought money into the marriage... that's the dowry. Whatever the amount, it's hers. The assets divided for the divorce... are only those gained during the marriage. That's right, that's it. Keep it in mind... A clueless man. Hi. Hey, you're here. How's your couple with Noriko? Of course, Noriko loves Shota very much. As my sister loves you Taizo. Of course. I'm wondering what there is to love. My humor and my good taste. So what do you love in me? Isn't it obvious? Your beauty. Idiot. We should eat together. I wish, but I'm so busy at work. What brought you here? Mother and father will be visiting the graves. Yes, I heard. when is that? The day after tomorrow, would you go with them? If you don't have time. Or we could just send some money. Shota's opinion. Just for the incense. How much? This amount maybe? The truth is, I'm in a tight spot. You don't need that much. Half is quite enough. I'll pay for both. Really, you would? Kai-chan get the money. You'll give it to them? -Yes. Then I'll write both our names. Sorry, thank you so much. Hello...Hey, uncle Shota is here. I missed you. Ok, Shigeko, I'm going. You have to go? Could you tune my piano next time? Ok, next time then. Take care. -Thank you. Good evening -Stop, I'm hot. Too bad, maybe you... Don't, that's creepy. Idiot. Mrs. Kimura, it's time for the CT. I'm removing the cover. Bending your knees. Your hand. I'm turning you around. 1,2,3. Good. Are you dizzy? Please grab the bar. Your hands in my back. I'm 80 kg. Sorry about that. It's ok. You'll have to stand up. 1,2,3. Are you dizzy? -No. I'm turning you around. Sit down. Good. I'm visiting my folks tonight, come along? -Shouya- Sure. -Noriko- Nurse Hirata. -Yes? Are you single. No, I'm married. That's too bad. What? My grandson asked me... to ask you if you were single. That biiig guy who visited you recently? Yes, he’s a rugby player. That is a pity. You're visiting the graves with your wife? That's great, I wish I could too. My hometown. Where is your hometown? Same as him. At Seto Inland Sea. A green island in the middle of a clear blue sea. "Matsubara distant far away..." "The shadow of a white sail floats." Hirata, you see... my dream was to retire there... and sitting on a rock on the shore... spend the rest of my life fishing... gazing at the horizon. What are you waiting for? You are retired. It's not my decision. -Whose then? My wife's. She wouldn't live in such boring place. She couldn't stand it a week last time. She was clear. Is your wife from Tokyo? "Don't refrain on account of me". Even my daughter agrees. I was upset. -Just break up. Maybe I should. Pack up and leave. -Yes. You're so insincere, enough blabbering. I'll leave her... and take you along. No. What's up? I am drinking with Kakuta now. I'm not dinning with you. OK, I'll drink moderately. He's a doctor anyway. The old trickster would take care of me. Ok, good, thank you. My daughter-in-law. What a pain in the neck... "Don't drink", she says. One bottle. Come on, Mr. Hirata. You're so lucky that she cares about your health. Shouldn't you be grateful? She's right, when my daughter calls me rarely... just to ask, "Dad, give me some money." On a sweet tone. And you give her. I don’t want to hear that. You two guys should go home. This is the last bottle. Ok. Thank you. I'm sure you'll enjoy. It's a great season to go there. And to eat the delicious Seto Inland Sea seafood. Honestly, I don’t want to go. Why? The path to the graveyard is this steep, Noriko. I have to socialize with the old folks there... I can hardly get their thick accent. You can't let Dad go alone. You'd be worried. Mother knows the pain a daughter-in-law endures. It's the same everywhere. I'll tell you something, but keep it a secret... How is it between you and Konosuke? Why do you ask? -Because. He's aging exactly like his father. He's also losing his hair. Should I be worried? Of course. -Oh, no. Is it bad that he's like his father? Konosuke is inheriting all his bad traits too. I'll be patient because it's too late... but you can still change him. Wouldn't you want that? There's a lot I could say. But we'd only end up quarreling. I'm sure he'd understand if you told him. I'd like to find a job. My he'll probably be against though. You have something in mind? I'm just playing with the idea. I wish I earned my money. The monthly allowance... is just enough for the expenses. I've grown weary about my life recently. Weary, what do you mean? I'm entirely absorbed in a routine of menial tasks... in this small house. What are you talking about? Tell her, Noriko. I think that... you are doing a great job. But look... -Of course. The education of two kids, their school... your husband's temper. You're taking good care of them... and of father and mother too. You even help Shota. I owe you my university education. Everybody took good care of you. I'm always impressed when seeing her. She never rests even when we talk. Wiping the tables, cooking for the family. Ironing a dress, sweeping the floor. You're hard work supports this home. I see it all and I admire you. You're absolutely right. But in our modern society... the hard work of a housewife is not properly valued. Women's effort is taken for granted. That's the problem. That's how Konosuke sees you too. Yes, that's his big flaw. Hey, don't put him on trial. His ears are burning in Hong Kong. A trial 'in absentia'. Here he is. Evening. Good evening. Sorry to bother you. A gathering of my daughters-in-law? I don't mind your criticisms on my account... if it can help you girls to get closer. Let me not spoil this cute ritual. You can even wish me an untimely death for all I care. Dad. Ah, you're here? Let's go. We're going. I appreciate it, although you're busy. This is for you. -Thank you. Don't fall on that slope to the graves. I could fall straight into a grave. Wouldn't be convenient. It's not a good joke at all. Whatever. Good night. -Thank you. Hello. Good morning. Can't be. How is it? I made it as you wanted it. Let me play. -Sure. Hello? Shota, something happened. A burglar broke in. Come quick. Fumie, calm down, are you OK? I'm fine, he ran when he saw me. I was so scared. I can't even reach Konosuke, can you come? I'm on an important job, I can't come right now. First, call the police, it's 110. It's 110? -Right. Shota when will you come? -I'll call you later, sorry. How is it? It's brighter here. It's pretty good. Thank you. You took the shoe-print? -Yes. So, he took... about $100 change here and a watch. Is that what you usually have? Nothing of much value. So basically he didn't take anything else. Chief. Is that the milk he drank? Ma'am. What did you say he was doing here? He was drinking milk, sir. Don't need to call me sir. He was drinking. So when he saw you he put it back... and he left slamming the door. No. Before that.. -He did something else? He reached into the drawer of the freezer. Ans then? -He took it. What? Well...money in a zipper bag. What money was that? It's embarrassing. Money I hide from my husband. So you have a little hoard? If you put it that way. I'm not putting anything, a hoard is a hoard. Nothing to be embarrassed about. It's practical. All the wives have a hoard, I guess. Don't you have a hoard yourself? I get too little to afford hoarding. With your salary? How about your wife, sir? No need to call me 'sir'... I suspect she does... but I won't look for it... a couple needs tolerance. Sit down. Fumie. I heard you were burglarized. Awful. This is the police. I am not a criminal. My wife… is her sister-in-law... so I am her brother-in-law. I am not her real brother, just an in-law. Relax, you're not suspected. Thank you... Shigeko says that father's bankbook and Real Estate titles... are under the bed upstairs. I need to check... -It’s fine. the burglar did not go upstairs. Ah, that's a relief. You said you saw the burglar... Our eyes met. No way, how was he? did he wear a mask? With dark shades... -Shades? They don't dress like that. The professionals are rather inconspicuous. For example, dressed as office workers. Of course. With a mask, people would spot them. You are so funny. Thank you. I used to be in a comedy club... when I was in college. Ah, I have to call Shigeko. Keep the change. Thank you very much. Good to be home. Here you are. What happened, are you here? It's been a while. You were in Hong Kong. You're always so busy. There were customer complaints. The most annoying job. But the blame is on them. It's finally settled. I'm so relieved. Two drinking nights that killed me. With the Chinese customers. Great. I'm exhausted. How are the kids? At their evening class. I bought this at the airport. Shinsuke wanted VR glasses. And this is for you. Is a scarf. Water please. Why do you look so austere. What happened? To tell you the truth... Did you fight with Taizo? Come on guys don't bring your quarrels here. Right? It's not that. What is it? A burglar broke into your home. What? But he didn't take much. He didn't even go upstairs. He didn't touch your bankbook. You were out? I was home. I was cleaning upstairs and I took a little rest. I fell asleep unintentionally... that's when the burglar broke in. I am sorry. Of course, I was careless. I fell asleep with the door unlocked. But he really didn't take much. But still he took something. Just 120$ worth of change in that drawer. And my watch. The birthday present of my aunt from Meguro. Is that all? You have to tell him about the fridge. What about the fridge? In the fridge's lower drawer... I was keeping cash. Money that I was keeping aside. In case of emergency. And how much was that? It's not the amount that matters. It's gone now. It matters...how much was that? I didn't count exactly. A little more than 4,000$ I guess. Next to the natto I eat every morning... you had your little hoard. I never thought we could have such an amount of cash. But the other day you ask for an increase of your allowance? I am sorry. Listen Konosuke. In ten or twenty years... housewives often save such amount. Suppose you fell ill overseas... she'd have to take a plane. Emergency cash is necessary. So you keep a hoard too? Of course I do. Taizo is perfectly aware of it. Housewives have to do it. I was so looking forward to relax with a beer... and now my mood is ruined. Is that a way to talk to her? Fumie went through a terrifying experience. You should be comforting her. You're so petty. You have to be so hurtful? You have some nerve... passing such harsh judgment on other people's family. Other people's family? What are you saying? I was so worried I left my work. Shigeko. Please, don't get mad. Go now. I'm going, you won't see me again. He's so rude. I'm sorry, you were so kind to come. Sorry my brother is such a jerk. Do you want to take a bath? I'll cook while you're in the bath. Please, don't be angry. What were you doing on the second floor... while he was stealing downstairs. I told you I inadvertently fell asleep on dad's chair. I know I was carelessness. I am sorry. While I'm working my ass off... struggling with the Chinese in my broken English. You were napping? The thug life. Don't judge me like that? Haven't I apologized enough? There's no big loss. That 4,000$ wad, no big loss?! That’s money I had saved on my personal expenses. It's tough, but the loss is all on me. So, can't you just move on? Please. -How can I move on? It's still money I earned. You simply hoarded on my daily grind. So, you all do that. And Shigeko too, with her superior airs. How about you try to earn money. My bath. Good evening. Mom I'm hungry. Dad brought us gifts. VR glasses from Hong Kong. Mom, Dad is in the bath? Yes. Dad, can I open it? Go ahead. Amazing, thank you. So, you want to be buried here? Of course. We don't know who'll die first... am I supposed to come here too? Of course. I hate the thought. Why. All the generations come here... but I know none of them. At least when I die, I'd like to be free. What? You're not free now? Wouldn't you want to be free from me too? Don't be silly. So if you died, what should I do? Well, I have good friends in the Cultural Center. We'd like to buy a common grave. What would you think? Who cares if I'm dead anyway? You make your little private plans. They're there. Think about it. Mr. Yukio, it's been a while. Hello. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you very much. Yukio, please. Thank you. How's your wife? Good, thank you. Have a drink too. Taizo, I had a shock. Mom doesn't want to be buried with me. They're buying a common grave with friends. What a shock. Please tell that to Shigeko. You're so gloomy, what happened? Well, something terrible happened. At your place. What happened? It's not the right place to talk. You'll know at home. What? At least give us a hint. This is not a quiz. Come in. You're probably tired. Let's have a cup of tea. No need. What happened? Fumie is not home? It's better if you hear it from your daughter herself. Whatever, just spit it out now. OK, I'll tell you. I can’t say it. What happened? Can I say it? Fumie left this home. Where to? She hasn't told us where she is. She didn't know herself where she'd go. Did you know about that? I feared it could happen some day. This is awful. It's ready. Good evening. Noriko is here. Goodness, you called Noriko too? I'm late. Sorry, you must be tired. -It's OK. Taizo, give me a beer. I need a drink to get me through this. Sure. The fried noodles smell delicious. I'll give you a plate. Thank you, I'm so hungry. There you are. -Thank you. Good appetite. -Thank you. Konosuke, everybody is worried here... you should tell us something. What happened with Fumie when we were away? Nothing happened. There has to be a reason for this to happen. They told you? A burglar broke in here. Taizo told me. But he didn't take much. Are you kidding me? You think 4,000 is not much? He took that much? Fumie was keeping a hoard in the fridge. Konosuke. You're still sore about that money? That's why you fought with her. All the housewives keep a hoard. I keep one too. Give me a break. How much do you hoard? Are you keeping hundreds? thousands? A few hundreds would be ridiculous. A kid’s pocket money. Stop your silly talk. We're all concerned about Fumie, right now. Right. Kenichi, Shinsuke, you know where your mother is. We don't know. Isn't she at her brother's place in Osaka? Why don't you call them? What is that? I'm going to ask him if my wife is there? How stupid can I look? Tell him. Konosuke. Actually, I know. What do you know? I know where Fumie is. How do you know? She called me last night. She told me to keep her secret. But she can't keep it for herself. Where is she? At her parents' in Motai. There's a house you all used to go... when her parents were younger. That place is empty, she's there now. What a relief. At least we know where she is. You can't consider her missing. Everybody is relieved, right? How am I relieved? Why would she tell her where she goes? If she can't tell me, fine... but why not to Mom, Shota or Shigeko? Noriko is just a stranger. Noriko is not a stranger, she is my wife. Wasn't Fumie a stranger once too? I used to be a stranger too. What you just said, you're so like Dad. Indeed. Hey, what did I do? I see very well why Fumie would want to open up only to Noriko. I married into this family too. Mom too used to be a stranger. What matters now... is to understand what happened with Fumie... and persuade her to come back. Just apologize. Why should I apologize? Just do it. Just hold her hand and apologize. "I regret, I'm sincerely sorry." Why should I apologize? What did I do wrong? Look at me, it's me the victim here. The victim. Konosuke, it's not about who's the victim. It's just a couple's problem. You were awful to her. To drive Fumie out of here... you probably went very far. Keep your nose out of our couple... as I told you. I'm your sister and I'm concerned, it's only natural. Agreed. You, shut up, you're just an in-law. Konosuke, you're talking about my husband? Easy guys. You hold your horses. You're just a loser dumped by his wife. Don't say that. How can you say that... to your own son. I've had enough with y'all. I'm out of here. Dad, calm down. -I've had enough. Konosuke, Konosuke. Don't go, Dad. -Konosuke. Konosuke, you don't have to be that mad. Everybody is worried about you. I told you to leave us alone. Where are you going? I'm going to drink. I've had enough with this family. Wait. Konosuke. How are you going to manage with the kids' breakfast tomorrow? I could prepare onigiris in advance. Leave it to me, I'll be fine. I have been served so often, it's my time to serve. See kids, you have a super grandma. Who cares if Mom isn't here. Talk to him. I know it's tough. Uncle Shota, you love Noriko, right? Eh? That's why you married her. Well, obviously. How about my dad? Do you think he loves Mom? Do they love each other? Kenichi, look, you love milk tea. We were talking... Kenichi is wondering if his parents love each other. Do you know the story, Shota? How they both fell in love? No? Fumie told it to me. They were two young strangers riding Chuo line every day. One day, Fumie took that train, although she was sick. She was holding on to the strap... but her knees were wobbly and she was queasy. But that express train wasn't going to stop soon. Her situation was getting so uncomfortable... but further sideways a young man was sitting... and he offered to give her his seat. He was Konosuke? When they parted at Tokyo Station... he told her to take care and left. She kept thinking about him... and hoped to see him again. And about a month later... they met again at Tokyo Station. She thanked him for his previous kindness. And Konosuke asked her if she was OK? And she gave him a big white smile. He said her smile then was so charming... he fell in love on the spot. Wow, they have such a romantic story. Kenichi, you don't have to worry. But... now it has gone cold... Mom's love for Dad. They have no choice but to separate. Husband and wife must love each other. That’s the meaning of a couple. Dear, get up, prepare breakfast. Hey, what is it? It came back. My back pain, I can't move. You can't get up? Impossible, I can’t move. Dear, prepare breakfast for everyone. Me? Yes. Konosuke's natto is in the second drawer of the fridge. What are you doing? Eating breakfast, as you see. You're glad with that? No, we're not glad, right? Grandpa, have one. I am not a monkey in a zoo. That hurts. How about 2, 3 bananas in your lunch box? No way, they'll laugh at us. What can we do? Today, I'll buy bread at the school canteen. Give me some money. I'm not coming back tonight. After cram school I'll go to the store. Anyway, Mom is not here anymore. There, spend it wisely for the both of you. You'll have more later. 100$. We're going. I am going too. Dad. -Ah? Their school uniforms are dirty. Mom should wash them. Please, ask her to do it. But, your mom... anyway, we'll manage. Dad, your lunch... Don't worry about it. Just go to work. You're not shaved. Well, I'll shave at the office. Washing... set it on 'quick', and then 'start'. Hey, Hirata. Ah, it's you Kakuta. Where are you? Here. You're doing the laundry? that's tough. Where is your wife? How is she? Doesn't look good. Can't you straighten her with a shot? Nope, she just needs to rest. It worked last time, right? I stayed in bed for a week. That's what it take. Sorry, dear. You said it's your day off? Help me with the laundry, to clean up, etc. Sure. Good. Look at that, their not rinsed. What's that about? The machine has a final cycle to rinse the laundry. Why don't you do it too? You're more apt than me at that. Don't shirk from your work. That's a bad timing another graveyard lot seller. Go buy a tomb. Come in, the door is open. Hello, I am from the Home-Helpers' Association. Why did you come? Dr. Kakuta called me. Since you're in a fix, I'm here to help. Fantastic, we're very grateful. The doctor came here already. May I come in? Please, please. It's a bit of a mess right now. Doctor. Ah. Did you do your breast cancer check-up, Kai-chan? I can check you up. I'll be fine. Move the furniture for the cleaning. Move that sofa. Ok. Home helper. -Yes. That's tough. Don't worry I'll do it. Go clean the entrance. Ok. Are you OK. -I'm OK. Be careful. Someone came? I heard a woman’s voice. I called the Home-Helpers' Association. She's a very good person. Oh? that's great. We're good, you can rest. You did a good job.. Hmm. The best beer is after work. Now you know how hard Fumie works. I couldn't take it more than one day. Same here. But there's still a pile of work. All the second floor... the weeds in the garden, shopping for dinner. I realize my wife was doing all this every day. The realization comes a bit late. She has endured it for decades. Yes, I can’t hold it down for half a year. Even half a year, come live with me. Silly boy. I am back. Hello. This is my grandson. This lady is a helper. Hello. Please take this tea to your grandmother. If she finished her soup, bring me the bowl. Ok. Such a good kid. I'm not a kid. Grandma, good day. Good day. You're bringing me tea, thank you. Does it still hurt? I'm sorry to let you down at such a moment. You probably miss your mom. It's my fault too, I could have seen it coming. I should have talked to your mother. I was busy with my silly literature instead. Grandma. Are Dad and Mom going to separate? They won't. Surely, they will patch it up. If Dad and Mom got divorced... I want to be with mom. Don't say that... don't say that to your dad. Poor Konosuke. Poor Konosuke. Hello there. Yes. Ah, it’s you, Auntie. So you're here, Fumie? The family told me they saw the lights last night. I was wondering who had come. It's been a while. How are you Auntie? Not great, I ache all over. These are from my garden, they're delicious. Although they look plain. Thank you. How are the kids? We used to see them every year. That's when the grandparents were still with us. They were going fishing together. Kids stop going on trips with their parents once they grow up. It's the same everywhere. How is your husband, Konosuke? He's quite fine. He has an important position in his company, now. He didn't come this time? Well, I am alone this time. I need to maintain this house too. And visit you sometimes. A deserted house quickly wears away. You remember Pr. Arima. The principal of the school. His house was demolished... and now it's just an empty plot of land. That splendid house? Right, it's getting depressing around here. I don't know what this town is turning into. I have to go pick up my grandson, see you around. Are you here for a couple of days? Come visit me tonight. Mom, don't be angry. For you. No way. What a surprise. How is Kyoko? Very good. Mom. You have a friend visiting. Who? Come out. Fumie. Hello. What happened? Last year, you didn’t come to our meeting. I'm sorry. Are you busy? Not at all. I am so happy to see you. You're not getting thinner. Don't say that. Have you had lunch? Not yet. Great, let's eat together. Come. Thank you. Don’t forget the pot cooking on the stove. Don't worry I'm not that senile yet. You drive the lady straight back home. Nope, I'm keeping her. We're going straight to Shinshu hot springs. You prick. That was so tough. Did the help go back? Yes, she did. What about the kids' dinner? It's on the stove. I just have to switch the burner on. I'm sorry. You had to do all that. Well, I'm a man of duty. Trust me for these simple tasks. Say... I'd like to go see her. See whom? I want to see Fumie, of course. She would speak frankly with me. If I wasn't sick... I feel restless. "Tobacco from Kokubu..." "that gives out a smoke..." a smoke? It’s terrible. Mr. Hirata. Mr. Hirata... fire. Sir. Hello, this is Kanai Tax advisor Office. A fire? We're not fire fighters. Call 119. Father? The house is on fire? Father, explain calmly. It is burning now? Are you standing in the flames? It must be hot? Run out, quick. What? What? It's put out? What? The damage? It's just the spoon and the pot? So it's no big deal. You scared me. So the firemen didn't come. I'm glad you stopped it in time. This situation is getting concerning. You want me to come and see? We can't, we're looking for Noriko's grandma in Shibawata. She unlocked the door and ran away. Mom says she often goes to Daikyo temple. We're in that temple with Noriko now. It’s getting dark soon, it's terrible. Wait. Grandma is there. She's talking with a monk. We've found her. I'll call you back later. Grandma, here you are? You can't run out without telling us. Mr. priest. I'm Noriko, her granddaughter. Thank you very much. Grandma, let's go back. I don't want. Mom is worried you know. It’s me, Shota. We found grandma. Yes, she was at Daikyo temple. Now we're taking a taxi. Where are you now? At the station. Then go back soon. Isn't it great grandma, the monk was so nice. That was a priest. He wasn't a priest, he was a monk. He was a priest. Grandma is catholic, she sees priests everywhere. Doesn't make any difference. Daddy. Daddy? What is it, dear. Where are we going? We're going home. Ah, nice. Sorry about that. Grandma is so lucky... to have grandchildren like you taking care of her. My kids don't care. Unforgivable. Look at the moon. "Watching the full moon at night." What happened? This is carp boiled in miso. Sorry, I still have work to do. Fumie, enjoy your meal. Thank you. Come, I'll take you to Mommy. Tell me if you need more saké. We have so much of it. Come on, drink all you like. So delicious. Our regional saké is the best. Tomoko, did Fumie tell you? Her fight with her husband? -Yes. As soon as you're away they understand how important you are. Your husband must be regretting by now. It's time to go back. Just take your own good time. Why? Just leave him. Maybe I should. That's a bad joke. She'd find a job here. As you say, Tomoko. This town needs more people, it's drained out. A beauty like you... you'd have 10, 20 men at your door. Too late, the flower's bloom is over. What are you talking about? Just put on a little make up. You'd seduce them all. I can open a snack bar with you. "Snack Fumie" I'd sing, you'd dance flamenco. We'd be famous. You're such a party girl. Raising three sumo wrestler boys does that to you. They each eat a kilo of rice a day. One kilogram? They eat like wolves. Not much to the brain but their body profits. Just like you. That's nasty. Good evening. I'm so hungry. Starving. Guys wait. This is Fumie, my friend. Say hello to the former "Miss Motai". Oh, come on. Come. Good evening. What's that "Miss Mokai"? Some kind of beauty. They're gonna eat through all our savings. Let's cook for the pack. What is it? I miss my kids, suddenly. This must be hard on them. What? I'm working now. Is it about Dad's fire? It's no big damage. Aren't you too harsh? Dad feels so bad. Well, he nearly burned the house down. You generated the whole situation with your quarrel. You came to tell me that? Listen. Don’t interfere into my couple's matters. Anyway, you're always on Fumie's side. We're not talking about sides here. Why are you saying that? I told you to stop interfering. Konosuke. You see... you and me never had a serious talk. Maybe brothers are always like that. But this time we really need to talk. Your life is at stake... and the happiness of our family too. Listen to me, even if it's a bother. What do you plan to do with Fumie? She left home in my back. So I'll see the other party's next step. The 'other party'? You're talking about your wife. It's possible that if you don't do the first step... Fumie won't come back. Let it be then. Two cups of coffee. Yes, right away. You don't measure the consequences. You're going for a divorce, the alimony... the custody of your kids, all these complications. Is that what you wish? Konosuke. I'm talking in your interest. What would you do if you were me? Yesterday, I talked with Fumie on the phone. Who called? You called her? I called her. You are interfering. I'm sorry. -Enough now, go. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. See, Konosuke... I asked her, the night of the incident... what happened between you guys. What you did was wrong. Who are you to judge if I'm wrong? Wrong about what? Here you are. Let me talk. You told her that you earned that stolen money. That, while you kill yourself at work... she's loafing around at home. Did you say that? Is it not true? She was napping... while I was slaving in Hong Kong? How painful the sales work is. You and Fumie have no idea. I know that you work hard. That would mean... owing to your hard work... Fumie can raise your kids, you think? Yes, obviously. But that is a wrong view of the situation. Precisely because Fumie takes care of the family... raises the kids, does the housework, etc... you're allowed to focus on your career. This is called 'sharing responsibilities'. Fumie has been slaving on these for 20 years. Can you measure that effort? Can you value it? Have you considered this, Konosuke? So, you think I should apologize. No. "I was wrong, sorry"? It's not about just saying it. It's about your heart. If you care about her. Enough. Do you? -I get it. I get it, you're rooting for her. When you got married... I saw how beautiful Fumie was... and I thought to myself that... you needed to make her happy. I was just a school boy. And I still think that.. What's wrong with me thinking that? I'll think about it. Konosuke. Go there now. Where to? To see Fumie. What is that? Can't you see I'm at work? This is one of the key points of your life. You can say whatever you want to your boss. Like, your wife suddenly fell ill and she's at the hospital. Anyone would tell you to go see her now. Right? Do it. I'm begging you. Who is it? What? Another burglar? Ah, it's you? I'm going to Motai. What for? What for? I'll bring Fumie back. Even though he wants his wife back... with that attitude he won't make it. it's more like he's on a quest for revenge. She won't come back. Hello. What is it? So kind of you to call me. Yes, it’s terrible. I have leaks everywhere. It hasn't been maintained for so long. Is your family ok? I have a visitor, I'll call you back. You scared me. You could have called before. You wouldn't have picked up. Did you come by train? I drove two hours, I'm exhausted. Just get in. Are you alone? Who else? Did you eat? -I'm fine. I'll fix you something? How did you explain to your boss? I said my wife was sent to a hospital. What if they find out it's a lie? We'll see that later. What? I bought it at Hong Kong airport. From the other day... I had forgotten. Can I open it? Did you chose it yourself? Yeah. Roses. Fumie. What is it? I can't live without you. I need you. Scared me. So much rain. Because of global warming, maybe. Good evening. What happened? We gathered because we're concerned. And Dad? He went to pick your mom up. So Mom is coming back? I don't know that. It all depends on your dad. I see. Grandma, I'm hungry. I'm gonna faint. What do we have for dinner? Ah, I totally forgot. Mom, what should I do? Sorry, I didn't think about it. I can't even help. And I'm never hungry. I'm not blaming you. What do we do? It’s too late, we should order in now. Good idea. Dad, how about rice & eel? Since that young man warned us about the fire... Eel or sushi, it's my treat. Great. Taizo, make the call. Since it's a special occasion, let's take top quality. Really? what's the occasion? In the midst of this all at least we can treat ourselves. Order for 1,2,3,4,5. How about the kids? Isn't it wasted on kids? Alright then, 6, 7. Noriko will be here soon too. 8 then, Taizo you order. Shigeko, they might come back in the meantime. We don't know if Fumie will come back. Definitely, she'll come back. 10 top quality orders, huh? Dad, is that OK? It’s really expensive. Do I have to pay it all. Of course. How much is it? You said it was fine, don't be stingy now. Now you say I'm stingy? Shigeko, Dad said it was all fine, but... he didn't mention top quality. Well said. So rather than top quality... let's take the average, with a lower quality. Enough bargaining, you're pathetic. I'll treat you. Taizo, order 10 eel&rice, top quality. Really? Of course. Why are men so stingy? It's just that Mom is rich. How much does your hoard amount to? Dad, you don't know? Her late brother, the novelist Kaoru... is a best-seller these days. Mom receives monthly royalties. You mean, you even have a bank account. Yes, I do. So, your bank book is hidden somewhere? No, it is not. But you do have an account? You're outdated, now bank accounts are managed here. Fingerprint authentication, I put my finger here. That's all it takes. You took a peek? She's so rich. Good evening. Sorry I'm late. With that heavy rain. The kids? -On the second floor. Kenichi, Shinsuke, I bought something for you. Sorry, a busy nurse like you, you're sucked into that turmoil. What is it? -You guess? "VOILA" cakes? -You guessed right. Yay, thank you. That’s great. Konosuke isn't back yet? He probably arrived at Motai after 5 pm. He's been there 3 hours. If he did well, they should be back soon. You mean Fumie will be with him? Of course. What do you think, Shota? Do you think Fumie will come back? We all want her back... but it's her choice after all. What will she decide. In a text she said she missed the boys. She said she was sorry about their pain. You guys are sad, right? She can have the kids 2 -3 days a week even if they get divorced. On appointed days, right? Don't say things like that. It's Konosuke. He just left the highway, he'll be here in 10 to 20 minutes. Is Fumie with him? He doesn't say. Surely, he would have mentioned it. Does that mean that he is coming back alone? What are we going to do, Dad? Listen, everyone. If Fumie doesn't live here... we know this home will go to shambles. But she left aware of that fact. The problem between them... is not easy to solve. As his father, it's sad to say this but... according to my predictions... he's not sensitive enough to bring Fumie back. He may even come back depressed after a big fight. I know it's sad but that's surely the case. The whole family here... should decide about this home. Since we're all here together. Shota, since you live in a small apartment... you could take this opportunity to move here? You want Noriko to take Fumie's place... and take care of the kids and parents? Right. That's totally impossible. Well, in that case, the both of us would move out. What do you mean? I sell my assets and we'll go to a nursing facility. Do you know the cost of these institutions? No I don't. How about this? You sell off this house, buy something smaller... and with the leftover money Mom and Dad pay a facility. And Konosuke and the kids would live without their mom? Kenichi and Shinsuke are not kids anymore. They can manage their own cooking and washing. They can clean on Sundays do the shopping... do their laundry. Well, they can't, right? Of course, they can't. Grandpa, I'm sure we can do it. Just like your father, you can't. You guys have been so pampered by Fumie. Don’t say that, Kenichi is so brave. Dad, don't belittle your son and your grandsons. He should look at himself before judging others. Look at myself? I don't think I'm the issue here. Please, don't argue. I can work hard and take up Fumie's tasks. How far will you go, today it's your back, tomorrow your knees. You can't do much good. You have to be so hurtful? That's why I don’t want to be buried with you. What is Mom talking about? Shut up. When you feel cornered, you just tell people to shut up. As usual. Hey? The rain seems to have stopped. Konosuke is back, he's entering the garage. Oh, my God. Wait. Where are you going? -We'll greet him. Wait, as I said before... Fumie is probably not here. He's surely depressed now. We must welcome him warmly. Right, sometimes you're clever. So what do we do? Let's sit down. We'll sit quietly. As if we had a casual chat. When we see him, we say "Hi, are you hungry?". Or something like "There's eel&rice coming, care to join us?" Above all, don't inquire about Fumie and how she is. Right. Don’t talk about marriage, divorce, etc. But I can't stand it. Pretend it's all fine. Pretend to be calm. Such a peaceful day. Good evening. -Dad, good evening. So, you all came I'm exhausted, I'm getting old. Hey. What's with Fumie, she's not coming back? Just don't. Dad, I'm sorry you... -It's fine. That's how it is. We have to face the future now. It’s not that... -It’s fine, it’s fine. Face the future. -Dad, let Konosuke talk. How is Fumie? She didn't listen to you? She did, and she's here with me. Who? -Fumie. Mom is back. Fumie is back. Sorry, everyone. You don’t have to apologize. You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not wrong, you faced the future. What should I say? You are the lady of this house, just say "I am back". Right, Kenichi. -Yes. I am back. -Welcome home. Are you resuming your functions from tomorrow? If it's OK. How could it not be? In my absence... Dad told me you all helped. Thank you all. Konosuke, you should be grateful. Dear, say something. Well, absolutely. Absolutely what, Konosuke? You see Noriko, when I left the other day... I told Shigeko I was fed up with the family. You sure did. I'm taking that back. Thanks to everyone, it's all repaired. And I'm ready. But I wasn't very self-confident. Shota. I hate to thank you but... there, it's OK. Thank you for your trust. 10 eel&rice coming. Perfect timing. -We needed that. Kenichi, eel&rice. -Nice. So hungry, I'm starving. Young man, thank you for last time. You saved this house from the fire. Anyone would have done it. Good job. let's have a toast. Amazing. Hard times makes the family stronger. Grandpa, your eel&rice. -It's top quality, Grandma's treat. Dear, come eat with us. -It's sold out. Such a beautiful moon. Really. Lady Moon, how many millions and billions of years... have you been protecting our Earth. Our life is so tiny compared to you. Just a fleeting dream. Grandma’s eighty years of life went by in a blink. Something happened to Grandma? Mom just called. -She ran out again? No, we'd been applying for a nursing home... and they finally accepted her today. That home is close to our place. She's moving in tomorrow. It’s great, your mom should be relieved. I don't know if Grandma will accept. She will be confined and lose her freedom. That's sad. But if it kept on going that way... mom and grandma would both collapse. They don't have a choice. There's no other way. Both situations are solved for your Mom and Fumie. It's a relief. What is it? There's one other issue though. What is it? I'm going to the hospital tomorrow. Well sure, you do have to work. You have to go every day. It's another hospital. Are you sick? You need a treatment? So why do you go to the hospital? Why would you... What? Are you... Father, don't sleep here, you'll get cold. Go rest upstairs. Good night. Grandma and Grandpa kiss like that. Really? -Really. I saw them. No way. I love you. What's this? Gimme a break. What are you doing?
