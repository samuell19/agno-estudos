Chuji Part 3 Pursued by the cries of the officials Chuji flees Mt Akagi carrying Kantaro and heads to Shinshu I cannot accept care of this poor child. I refuse not from fear of the Shogunate or public censure. Oyabun Chuji the just I would never refuse. I would refuse the Chuji rumour says is now a petty thief! A man does not choose to be down on his luck. No one would believe such a rumour... were I the Chuji I was until yesterday. Who could the thief be? I would never have thought it was you, Chuji. But if the thief calling himself Chuji were one of your men... 'Kill I may, but never my own.' Thus do I show faith in my men. No man who has pledged loyalty to me over a sake cup... has ever betrayed me! None of my men, regardless of his predicament would dare defame Chuji Very well. I will be guardian to Kansuke's son. Little boy. I bid you farewell at last. I am Yasuzaemon, head of the Kabe family. For whom do you speak, sir? Me, I'm Kunisada Chuji, from Sai County, Welcome! How may I help you? Lend me some money for traveling! CHUJUI OYABUN. Is it you who break into houses claiming to be Chuji? Why did you entertain them, knowing they are swindlers? A short while ago, you insisted none of your men was a thief. Even if you were wrong, you trusted your men implicitly. A heart such as yours is worth a thousand pieces of gold. I wanted to preserve your faith that no man of yours was a thief. Kill I may, but never my own. I have never drawn my sword against a man of mine. AWAY! Once debased, a man is utterly despicable I will speak no more. I am a mere thief. Must the boy go with you? I pity him, but honour prevents me from accepting your help. I will not stop you! May we meet again. Farewell. Sir, are you not cold? It is their road to Shinshu that will be cold. Chuji has gone, his footsteps heavy. I would not be unduly concerned if he were traveling alone. But the boy is a hindrance. Bunzo, I would like to honer my word and care for the boy. Would you speak to Chuji for me and bring Kantaro from him? Furuta, in Echigo-Nagaoka, a castle town long famed for its sake brewery. Happy sounds of children enjoying themselves Stand up! You should pray! Around the 33 temples we go! Stand, you crippled novice! Around the 88 temples we go! To hide away Chuji has become Sadakichi, chief clerk of Sawada-ya Looking at the children playing, Chuji could not forget Kantarou from whom he had parted in Shinshu. They say I turn the wrong way, so they won't let me join in. I don't mean to make mistakes.. But I can't seem to get right and left straight. Take one child away. Which shall we take, this or that? Take one away, child or chide, hid or hide, and round and round. Okume, daughter of Kihei, sake merchant. Okume, not knowing Sadakichi is Chuji seeks an opportunity to reveal her heart. Sadakichi... Sadakichi... Sadakichi... I'm sorry... I am dwelling on childhood memories. I yearn for those innocent days, devoid of jealousy or betrayal. So do I... Oh, to recapture that distant past, untainted by melancholy! The sound of the evening bell, distant, sinks into their two hearts Twilight, twilight, make tomorrow clear and bright! Her father, Kihei of the Sawada-ya. My daughter seems somehow odd recently, maybe she's possessed by a Tanuki. Right side up! Tomorrow will be fine. In the The Sawada store. This letter cannot be mine. My boorishness causes chatter among the women here. Could it be for me? I love how you use your toothpick! Strange but sweet, a toothpick ties the knot of love! 'Fly with me', she says. 'I will endure any hardship for you.' Oh.. this is for me. Sorry, Sadakichi! I used your name to avoid my father's meddling. I guess women fall for breeding, I picked my teeth for her... but she didn't seem impressed. That night. One thing I cannot abide is an amateur gambling! No gambler comes to a respectable end! As you say. Your father's reprimand is most judicious. Gambling is not for decent men. As heir to the Sawada-ya, wealthiest family in these parts, your clothes should not smell of the gambling den. One day, my son, the Sawada-ya will all be yours. I permit some youthful pleasures, but do not gamble. I won't, I won't. I will gamble no more. But today, please allow me leave for just a short while. How can trust I your intentions? I will never gamble again! It is a woman who calls. The young master gives his word. Please grant him leave for this head clerk's sake. In a room deep in the house, not knowing that night was drawing on. Tell me something. Do you know a house of pleasure called Ohgi-ya? And a woman there named Shinobu? Yes, Miss. Shinobu the courtesan! Is she pretty? Yes, yes, yes, definitely, yes! Would you like one? What are you doing there? Go inside, dear, lest you catch cold. As the cold weather approaches, Chuji again suffers from palsy on the right side of his body. Next morning. I so admire how you handle a toothpick, my dear young sir. Well, it's not that impressive! And about us... you'll tell me more next time you come? My father's a pest. Let's run away to Edo and make a new home! You say that just to please me.. Far from it! I mean what I say! Do you, really? If It's a lie... About last night No, don't say a word! As long as it's not too serious, I'll say nothing. Every young man experiences youthful ardour... You're very understanding. Maybe Okume heard the two talking and, with Nobuo's permission, went to meet Chuji. Then, one day. I'm so embarrassed! Right here in broad daylight, unabashed, I open my fool woman's heart to you! I confess my love, and get turned down flat! I knew it! You have a sweetheart in Nagaoka. It serves me right! Falling in love with an employee and making a fool of myself! Come and play with us, mister! You be 'it' first. One day, Chuji with Young Master Ginji came to Nagaoka to collect money and returned slightly early to the inn. Don't worry! In wickedness, I am wily as any serpent. What about this scheme? I've got hiccups that won't stop. Someone startle me. That won't help. Just bring me some water, hot or cold! It's too hot! I can't drink that! Get me something cold! I told you my name is Sadakichi, head clerk of the Sawada-ya! I am not Kunisada Chuji, as you say. You are Chuji Oyabun. I'm not mistaken! Well, if you insist, I can be Chuzo, Chuta, Chubei, Chuzaemon, or Chuemon. Or Chusuke, Chunai, Chukichi, Chuhei, Chumatsu, or whatever! Or else Chuhachi, Chushichi, Churoku, Chugo or Chushiro. If you wish I could be Chunojo, Chuma, Chudayu. Chunoshin, or Chuya. Or, indeed, I could be Chuji, as you say. However, I expect you to restore the money the young master lost. The entire amount. Not a penny less! Of course! You need not even need mention it. Mr. Kunisada! If you could examine the money... Please examine it, young master, just in case. Sadakichi! The money I had bore Sawada-ya stamps, but this doesn't. You heard him. I do not imply that the money is fake, but you understand we would like the original gold returned. Of course. I understand. One more thing! The money the young master paid to redeem the woman, Shinobu, should be returned as well. Is something wrong? How much would a herring this big cost in Joshu, I wonder? I don't know. You seem rather lenient with your children, sir! Huh? What d'you mean? I see they've made big holes in your new sliding doors. And you haven't complained once! You imps! Don't play in there. Go play hide and seek outside! Don't be harsh with them. I doubt they meant any harm. Have your hiccups stopped, Boss? Chuji went to Sawadaya to get money, leaving the severely wounded Ginjiro in the care of a doctor. Your generosity exceeds even that due an old friend, my dear Kihei! I am very grateful. My most humble apologies! A petty merchant like me forced to treat you as a mere clerk! A man renowned through all the Kanto region! Forgive me! No matter. There was a time I thought that under the circumstances I wouldn't have minded growing old and dying here. Perhaps I would have been happy if that had happened. However, now that they know I am Kunisada Chuji there will be no escape for me! In any case, I must flee at once. Please take care of the rest. Oyabun... My only concern is your daughter. I understand. Even Kunisada Chuji cannot slay a man without a sword! Then arrest him! Have him bound! Open the door! It's an emergency! Kunisada Chuji! Surrender! Oyabun... A fool... my daughter was a fool! I wonder... if I hadn't been a wanted man... Trust me! Please go at once! I, Chuji, have no wish to shed blood now. Keep away! If you come closer, I must use my sword. No man is Chuji's match. Retire now. Why risk death? Scoundrels! Must Chuji prove himself now? Despite my protests, you leave me no choice. Will you force me to use my sword? You will see how Chuji cooks with even his left hand! Don't stand on ceremony. Go ahead! Haven't you had enough? Not yet? It is time you stopped, is it not? Barely cutting his way through the surrounding Otozo, the strenuous activity causes a flare up of his chronic palsy. In stealth and in pain he finally reaches the Numata inn... on Mt. Akagi, in his home region of Joshu. Kan-Chan, come play with us! Kantaro, who Chuji left with Yasuzaemon is now learning Yasuzaemon's business. Let's play cops and robbers! Lend me your cane to use as my sword! Please, mister! A Komatsu Goro sword can kill with a touch! Kantaro, may you live in good health! Why did I let Kantaro go? Kantaro, would you once more take my hand and lead me! Kantaro! My life, my joy! Kantaro! Kantaro! Silence! You fool mountains! Can't you stop repeating?! Be silent, or I will disembowel you! Did you follow me? Why are you afraid? Where did you take Kantaro? Where did you hide him?! Bring him or I'll kill you! He is playing up at the top of that mountain Chuji's comrades are lying low by running a restaurant in Takasaki, a city in Joushuu. Grate the yam. Right! Later wash a quart of herring roe. Agreed! After that, cut up dried daikon. Uh, right! Slice vegetables. All right! Get five or six citrons. Right. Make the spring onion and shellfish with miso and vinegar. Cook tofu and fried bean curd. In the meantime, pickle the turnips. After that's done, filet the carp into three pieces. After the main dish, cook the rice! Got that? Got it! Then repeat what I just said! YOU repeat what you just said! They say that recently a felon was arrested in the mountains. Yes! They say it's Chuji, but when his men find out there's sure to be an uproar. I heard a few days ago in Numata that the gentry through the whole Kanto region are worried about the Kunisada family! They're going to take Chuji to Edo as soon as possible. Maybe even tomorrow, before his men hear he's been arrested! That night. Hozumi... I hear you work for the magistrate now. Yes, in hopes that I might be of help at a difficult time. Nothing could be better! You can be of help now. You want to know what route they'll take the Oyabun, and when. Set a thief to catch a thief! I despised you for betraying us. I didn't know your good intentions. I, Miyotaro, owe you an apology! One band escorts Chuji away and another carries the news to Tama village, where waits his beloved mistress, Oshina. Chuji and his escort arrive at a Buddhist temple outside Isezaki. Genji, open the door! We know you were a Kunisada man! Do not try any tricks on us out of duty to that family! You gentlemen are searching for Kunisada Chuji, I presume. If that's the case, just tell me so. Chuji did come here a short while ago. He came with ten men They demanded I feed them. I told them I had no rice. But the yams were freshly cooked, hot and ready. 'No!', said they. Kunisada Chuji will be disgraced if it is known he ate yams. They threatened me with swords, demanding I take them somewhere where ten could eat. There will be a Buddhist mass at Kanshuji Temple, I said. Your enemy are ten scoundrels! You are so few be sure to be on your guard! I can't stay here much longer. Deceived, he goes down the long road at night alone. By moonlight, Chuji and his men journey to Kunisada village. I bid you welcome, My Lord. Hearing the voice of Oshina after many years, Chuji was filled with boundless love. The Oyabun says... A few days later Chuji has recovered somewhat and carefully, defended by 8 men, he is conveyed in great secrecy to the dried up well of Shozaemon, master of Kunisada village. Oshina, part way home from having gone to pray for Chuji's recovery. Excuse me, but are you not Mistress Kunisada? The Oyabun is in great danger! What is your name? My name? I am no one worthy of a name. Please lake good care of the Oyabun. I want a word with you all. Please ask everybody to come to the storehouse. Asa! Mitsugi! Narizuka! Matsuida! Takasaki! Hozumi! Ashikaga! Tetsu! To think that one of us... What are you saying, Ma'am? Who here is ungrateful enough to forget the generosity of the Oyabun in his motto... Kill I may, but never my own? Do you mean what you say? That there is a traitor among us? This is an outrage! Much we can bear! But we will not stand for this, will we, Mitsugi? Absolutely! Even one as close as you cannot degrade us thus! First I demand you tell us what betrayal this traitor has committed! If we don't know what he did, your claim is not even justified. First the details. Second, the name. And third, the proof! YOU FOOLS! Only worthless souls make such noise! Quiet! Alas, for shame! Misery without honour means the end of the yakuza! Here he comes... Now we'll know who the traitor is! Oh dear! What is happening here?! Well, he thought it was a message, and it was nothing! As the old man was coming I thought I would see if I could play a trick and trap him. He took the bait and was caught in his own net! The betrayer was the double agent Unosuke Hozumi. Chuji, respected as the great Oyabun of all Kanto cannot find rest even here at the bottom of a well! So sad... what a shame... We are ready to take the Oyabun to Jokoin Temple. Mistress, the police have been alerted! They're in the village! Take him to the storehouse! Chuji, will you accept the mercy of the law? Surrender quietly! Sir, do your duty.
