I should've told you. Ah, we're, we're fixing up this house that I'm going to moving into, a new place, and, uh... (HAMMERING IN THE BACKGROUND) Can I see you later? I've got a class. Well, nice lunch. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. See you. (METAL BANGING) Aah! (BANGING) Hey. Why did they have to kill him? Come on. Let's get away from here. (METAL RODS CLANKING) Dave was a nice boy. He was a shit! But you... But you married him. (SNIFFS) Look, you'd marry anybody too, to get out of Saskatchewan. Don't be mad at me. - Uh, I'm sorry. - I'm, I'm not mad at you. It's just... I, I'm late and everything. You want to go to your friends? Come on. I'll take you. (HAMMERING) SALLY: Okay, stop right here. (HAMMERING) This is the place. You see that kid on the roof, he is in my class. Come on in. WOMAN: Hi, Sally. SALLY: I know I'm late. (BEEPING) Bernie, I'm sorry I'm late. Really, I know I'm over two hours late. Forgive me, okay? Oh, Lou, Bernie. Bernie, Lou. Come see my room. It's great. - Hi. - Hi, Sal. This Bernie, you're living with him? There's 10 of us living here. We're all dealers, would-be dealers. Bernie's baccarat. Fancy game with the shoe, huh? Very elegant, Bernie. I'm elegant, too. - AGNES: Hi. - Hi. Well, that's Agnes. She's roulette. (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) SALLY: You are never to split a 10. A 10 is dynamite when you got a two-card. But after that, it can be your tragic flaw. But It's, it's not just dealing the cards, you know. You have to know how to surrender, and how to wash the, the deck, and how to, when to burn it, how to pluck chips, share the box. Stuff like that. When do you take your test? Three weeks. I'll be making $20,000 a year. - No kidding? - Yeah. 30,000 with tips, if I'm really good. Hey, (BOTH LAUGH) I'm gonna hang on to you. Be a gigolo. What about Grace? She came down here during the war. Beauty contest. Oh, for Miss America? No, nothing like that. More like, uh... Miss pinball machine. She came. She needed protection. I protected her. She was this teenager. You protected her for 40 years? Well, she got married along the way. Cookie Pinza. But I don't wanna talk about Grace. (TAP WATER RUNNING) Do you love her? I watch you. SALLY: Huh? The place where we live. I watch you. Through my window? LOU: You saw me? I figured maybe somebody was there. Did you know it was me? But you were just this... This guy across the way. LOU: Why do you use lemons? The fish smell. I'm embarrassed. LOU: Oh. I thought maybe it was for some other reasons that I didn't understand. I even went to a supermarket, to look at lemons. It's just to get the smell off. It's nothing weird. What do you do when you watch me? I look at you. You take off your blouse and then you run the water. And you take a bottle of gold perfume, and you put it on the sink. And then you slice the lemons. You open a box of blue soap. You run your hands under the water to feel the temperature. Then you take the soap in your hands and... (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) (HAMMERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Are you Dave Matthews' wife? Look, are you a cop? I told you guys I don't know anything about him. Let's have a look in the bag. What are you talking about? Wait, the lady said... Wait. Let go of him! Wait. Don't... (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Hey! (SALLY GROANING) Hey, you relax, old man. This is none of your business. You don't wanna get hurt. (SALLY STRUGGLING) (SCREAMING) Ah! (CRACKING AND CLUNKING) (CLUNKING CONTINUES) (CAR DOORS CLOSE) (ENGINE STARTS) (DOG BARKING) Are you all right? (PANTING) SALLY: Maybe you should go lie down. I don't wanna lie down. (PANTING) I didn't protect you. GRAVE: Where the hell have you been? Men were here tearing the place apart. You go out, you don't even tell me you're going. (PANTING) Are you okay? What the hell are you wearing? That girl buying your clothes now? Miss, I warn you, stay away from him. Oh, Christ. Did he let that happen to you? I'm all right. You shut up, Grace, you goddamn old lady! GRACE: If I'm an old lady, what does that make you? I'm her I over! (GRACE LAUGHS) GRACE: You wanna know his nickname in the old days? Numb nuts. Men had names like legs and bullets and cookie. (PANTING) His was numb nuts! (FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS) Lou, open this door. I know you're hiding in there. SALLY: Chrissie? Chrissie? (KNOCKING THE DOOR) Oh, my... GRACE: You didn't protect her. What's your life worth? Cookie had more manhood in his toupee, than you've got in your fat frame. (GRACE KNOCKING) Open this door! CHRISSIE: Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Chrissie? Are you okay? Chrissie, look, look. Are you all right? Are you hurt? It's me. Chrissie. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Okay. Come on. Look, it's gonna be okay. GRACE: Lou? Open the door, please. I'm sorry. You're a wonderful man. Sometimes I forget to tell you, how much I love you. Lou? SALLY: Chrissie, listen to me, you're all right. You're okay. Just take it easy. You're gonna be fine. You're all right. That's it. Come on. Okay. Okay. Oh, my god! You heard them. Why didn't you call the police? My husband Cookie Pinza said, "Never call the police." (FOIL SCRAPING) GRACE: Honey, it's not the first time. Let me tell you. When a bad element from New York had my husband killed on the boardwalk, Lou ran away. He ran away then... So he runs away now. What do they want? Chrissie, CHRISSIE: Nam myoho renge kyo. What are they looking for? Why did you come here? To see you. Don't give me that shit. She's a good girl. Why did you come here? To sell some dope. We needed money for the baby. Oh, Chrissie. There's nothing wrong with dope. And dope belongs to the whole world. Where did he get it? Well, some people told us about a drop in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a nice place. What did he do with the money? I don't know where the money is. He went out with that old man. Dave went out with Lou? They took my scale. Yeah. Hey, I wanna talk to... Hey, pops, what... This is the last batch. 5 gs. Take it or leave it. Pops, I'm a little, ah, tapped right now. I can give you 4 gs and... Give you the rest later. I'll take it. Call Fred at the Club Harlem. Tell him you're dealing with Lou Paschall. That's me. Tell him to tell those hoods to leave the women alone. What they're looking for, I got. Lou? I'm getting compliments on the suit, Lou. You look sharp, buddy. Real sharp. In three weeks you'll become dealers... And you'll learn a painful truth, everybody hates you. You stand in the way of a million dollars. The player hates you. You know enough to cheat the casino, but the casino hates you. A TV camera over your head, tapes your every move, and yet you are alone. The players, floor manager, the eye in the sky... They all watch you. You alone. Mr. Shapiro wants to see you. Oh, Mrs. Matthews, how you doing? Come on in. Come on. How are you? Sit here. Come on. Um... Your husband had a record. I hadn't seen or spoken to him in eight months. Yeah. I know that. I understand that. And this is very unfair, but he... The record... I, I, I don't even know why he was here. Look I know that and you know that but they don't know that. They? The SEC, the gambling commission, the tax people. They don't know it. I... We just can't afford to have people with connections like yours working in this casino. I'm gonna tell you something... I feel that you have misled us, ah... Sally. Sally, right? Mr. Shapiro, please. I've only got three weeks of class left. I need... SHAPIRO: Look, I'm entirely on your side in this situation, but this is a very important job, and I feel that I just have to let you go. I'm sorry. Would it have made any difference if we hadn't been married? Marriage is not the point here. We have to be very careful of our people and who they know. Listen, if this guy loved you, he would've shown up sooner or later anyway. You know what I mean? So love is the point here? Yeah. They fired me. What? Six weeks of classes down the tubes, just like that. Can you lend me 50 bucks? I don't have it. I thought we were friends. Listen, I saw your sugar daddy down there at the tables. Really? Borrow from friends with bucks. 20. Push. Can we talk to you? Come on, I really think we should talk. Sir, please don't bother the players. You're selling something I believe belongs to us. I'd like the return of the item, and the money you received for the item. Hey, man. There's a game going on here. I'd like to know how the connections were made. The kid got my name in Vegas. Harry Gropke sent him to me. When you come to Atlantic city, I'm the man to see. Come on. We know who you are. You're nothing, Mister. Hey, there's a game going on here. Sir, you can't disturb the players. I think we should continue this outside. No! Let's go. Hey, hey, hey. You're playing with Dave's money. I'm owed it. Madam, please if you're not gonna play, you have to leave the table. Sit down and be quiet. Oh, yeah. You're buying me roses, I'm getting fired from my job, I'm supposed to sit here like some Vegas bimbo? Look, Mister, I've got hoods beating the shit out of me. If I'm gonna get beat up for money and drugs, then I want to have that money and drugs on me. Don't touch the suit. You're like Dave, gone senile. Madam, you'll have to go. Look, I trusted you. I'll take care of her. Look, he took my money. Make him give me back my money. But I want my money! You see that man over there? Where? The blue suit. SALLY: So? MAN: All he wants is a blonde sitting next to him. What, what do you mean? I don't... No, no. Strictly for luck. Nothing will happen. If he loses, he'll be too depressed to do anything. If he wins, he'll just talk about it. Pimp! What do you think I am, anyway? I'm trying to help you. Help me? You're trying to whore me. Is what you're trying to do. Get your hands off of me! You're gonna have to leave the casino, madam. Leave me alone! Look, you wanna to arrest somebody, go arrest that guy down there. He's the one pushing drugs. Leave me alone! SALLY: Somebody get my money back! That guy took my money. Let go of me! Give me my money back! Get that guy to get my money--. This woman is not allowed in the casino, okay? I don't wanna be in the casino! I want my money! What? You'll have these punks in here, you won't let me here? This guy beat me up. He wrecked my house. Let go of me! Come on. I'm very sorry, sir. This woman has just been fired. She's very upset. On behalf of the hotel, I'd like to give you both reservations for the Camelot Room, also the Superstar room I'm reserving for you. SALLY: Get your hands off of me! Let go of me! Let go of me I can walk out by myself. Get your hands off of me! Just get your hands off of me. Let go of me! Ouch! Let go! I can walk out by my... Let go. Are you happy? Okay? I'm out. (SIREN BLARING) Aw, shit. Hey! Hey, stop! Wait! Where did he just go? Thank you.

Here with the 11:00 report is anchorman Bob Wilson, and the award-winning Channel 7 news-watch team. Good evening. Violence has struck again tonight in Atlantic City. Fear and confusion now reside in the otherwise peaceful resort, NEWSREADER: after the brutal murders of two underworld crime figures. City law enforcement officials are being sought for comments. News-watcher Connie Bishop is standing by with a live eye-cam report from our sister city. Connie? Bob, it's the second night of violence in this normally quiet yet generally swinging casino capital of the east. Police Chief Allmond is the man with the answers. And he's pulling up right now. Chief almond, is there any connection between tonight's murder and yesterday's brutal slaying in the Park Mobile? We're tracing a new lead today. CONNIE: You sound angry. I'm damn angry. If mobsters come to Atlantic City, they're dead. They're gonna have to answer to me personally. CONNIE: So these are mob-connected slayings? There's no mob slayings in Atlantic City. Let them kill themselves someplace else, not on my turf. CONNIE: Chief, are there, are there any witnesses? Connie, please, thank you. So, there you have it, Bob. No clues, no witnesses. No one's really sure how the killers got away. Bob? BOB: Thank you, Connie. We'll have more from Atlantic City as this dramatic story unfolds. (GLASSES CLINKING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Is this the stomach?

Atlantic City became my home. You ought to fly home. I'll treat you to the ticket. You will? If you can get a seat belt around that. Oh, I never use seat belts. I don't believe in gravity. We both lost our men through a shooting. I don't mind that Dave's dead. It just means he'll be reincarnated sooner, that's all. You mean, Cookie's coming back? (LAUGHS) Sure. Everything comes back. You know, you look after people good. I never had to look after anybody. I was a princess. (SWITCHING RADIO STATIONS) (COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING) (TURNS RADIO OFF) I like that... Making the news. (LAUGHS) Oh... Who was Bugsy Siegel? Oh. The meanest, the coldest. And he was your cell mate? Well, I got to be honest. I was in the slammer on a D & D. What's that? D & D. Drunk and disorderly. They brought Bugsy there for about 10 minutes on the way to Leavenworth. Man, was he pissed off. Heh. He didn't even know me. And that's all? I never killed anybody in my life. I never thought you did. But I did tonight. You saw it. Yeah, I saw it. Some champagne? SALLY: No. You know, you got all those young guys... Bernie. You could still see them. I'm an old man.
