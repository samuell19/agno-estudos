Stop! The water is foul. What kind of ship is this? Stay where you are, you kidding me? What is this place? Not sure. Tell me right now what kind of ship this is. How did you find out about this? Where did you find out about this, one of the other prisoners? I found it. 301, come in immediately. I've got him. Alive and well. Quadrant 1138, repeat, 11, three, eight. And there's some kind of ship here in the desert. A wreck of some kind, he was trying to hide inside. I'm gonna take a look around and report back, over. - Roger that. - This is not a wreck. - Leave the ship immediately. - Copy that. What's that supposed to mean? "This is not a wreck." The lever. Have you gone mad? Hey. So there was a ship laying in the desert that is not a wreck and you just found it. Is that correct? Yes but the operating system won't boot up. Boot up. And you've flown before? Any experience with space ships? I worked in the ship yard. Ship yard. Try it again. Go on, try it. Seriously, have you gone crazy? Take the mug. Pour yourself some water again. Drink. Did you see any external damage to the ship? No. Give me some water. Do you think this thing can still fly? The heat works. What are you? Do you get a reward if you take me back? Now. Ultraviolet. Solar winds. Gamma rays. Just wanna know... Come on, sit down. All right, listen. I've never seen a ship that was crappier than this one here. And I've never seen a build like this either. Absurd. But it... can still fly. Listen. I may have a gun, this uniform but I'm just as disgusted with this place as you are. Where can we go? This is 301. The fugitive has resisted and has fled north. I am currently in pursuit in quadrant 1156. I repeat, quadrant 11, five, six, over. Novak, how the hell did that happen? Is he armed? They're gonna notice something is off. When the storm dies down and visibility is back to normal, they will capture us. 301, come in, is the target armed? So we have to make sure we get off this God-forsaken planet before the storm passes. Novak, do you read me? What's this? You're the engineer. I thought you were the one who worked in the ship yard. Save it. The ramp should go down if I push this, right? Move. The emitters in the engine need to be cleaned. Should I do that? That's what I was hinting at. Still don't have any oxygen supply, by the way. Toss me the light. Shouldn't you maybe take care of the oxygen first and then the hatch? Like maybe set priorities. The grime needs to be cleaned off the emitters and the propulsion unit, that's your priority now. Well what do I use to clean them? Use a rag. What is it? Nothing. Such a mess. The ramp is busted. It's gonna have to stay shut forever. Uh, here. Now listen to me, damn it. If there is still soot in the emitters when we decide to take off, then everything's gonna go to shit, do you understand me? Yeah. Okay, now. I could use a light down here. Hey, could you wet the rag for me? Here. Wait a second. Hey, do you have any idea what kind of ship this is? Like, where do you think it came from? No! Rag. And the crew? What kind of people were they? Where were they heading? I don't know. Hey, just take the booze. - Booze? - Yeah. Where? In the lower compartment next to the door. You see it? Okay. Wanna know how I escaped? I know how you escaped. Then why did they decide to send you after me? I volunteered. 301, come in. Nothing's a coincidence. Novak, do you read me? That's too soon. All right, I think it's all clean. Novak, there hasn't been anybody in 1156 for the last 32 hours. Hello? How much longer do you need? I said I think everything is clean. You think it's clean or is it actually clean? Look, it's still a mess back there. What's your problem? Hey, the storm hasn't gotten any weaker. Here, you have 30 seconds. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Where are you? Where are you? 301, report in immediately, that's an order. Novak, you are to exit the ship at once, do you read me? Hey. What's going on? This is 301, I read you loud and clear. I have the fugitive, I've always been one step ahead of you and I'm excited to say, to you especially, Gago, that we'll never meet again. Good riddance and thanks for nothing, over and out. [Gago Novak, what are you doing? You said we had time until the storm passes. I was wrong, is the engine clean? Give me the lamp. Novak, Novak, do you intend to launch? Get back, something's wrong. - What is it? - Here. Does this mean that the hatch has to close first? Novak, that's madness. Yeah, otherwise the engine won't fire. I'll take care of it. Novak, I'm talking to you, damn it. Novak, you can't start that ship up. You're gonna blow yourself to pieces. Do it. Novak, talk to me. Hurry up! Go, start it up. Wait, not yet. We're ready to go, get out of there. Wait, trying to fix the light. - Do it. - Come on. Start it up. Where do you want me? Close the bulk head. The jumpseat behind me. Pull it out, fold it up, sit down. Now! Get us out of here. Call it off, you maniac. Yes. Were you born there? No, you? You knew about the ship, didn't you? Once I got out, I just ran straight without stopping and eventually I stumbled across it. Is it just me, or is it hot in here? I spent my entire life gazing up at a dust-ridden sky. Does the radio work? Soon. The frequency can't be changed. I'll have a look at it in a minute. Shouldn't we take care of the radio first then the heat? Without heat, we won't make it for more than an hour. And besides, who do you want to talk to so badly? Did you notice that the speakers are broken? Membranes are cut up. What do you make of that? Hey, what about your radio? It doesn't work out here. It only works, take it apart a bit then we'll at least have a speaker. Just put it back down, it'll be great, ow! So, I can definitely repair the heat. Do you know what bunk you're gonna sleep in yet? Hello? - Sylbert? - Huh? No, no, no bunk yet. How fast can you type? I don't know, fast. Good, then you have the liberty of doing the first mission log entry. Hey, do you mind, what do you make of this? No, idea, what's that supposed to be? That's the question. It's probably nothing. I just thought maybe it could be some sort of plant and not the kind of plants we know, rather something different. I call the top bunk, by the way. So, there's a new crew on board. Starting as of... 07086013. There are two of us. We found the ship in the desert at kilo nine, 10 degrees west and 17 degrees north. We have food and water to last 311 days. Oxygen for 306. The main hatch is jammed. We can only enter and exit through the propulsion shaft. Our heat is on the blink. So is the radio but we'll get everything going again once we reach Onasis. Close. Once we what? Here. Behind this line, there's no one left to bother us. How so? What's there? - No clue. Is that our solar system? It says something different here but that's definitely Onasis. Yeah and right outside this line, it's where space really begins. All right. I'm gonna go start on the heat. What exactly do you mean by "really begins"? Freedom! Do you know if there are any people there? Everything is there, my friend. Why is it named differently on the map? No clue. Once we reach Onasis, or Terabus Three. Okay, think that's it. That's on warm and 15, okay. And go. Ah! Did you hear? The heat's working. Do you think it got colder in here? No! Think something's wrong with the heat again. Hello? - Sylbert? - What? Everything okay? I have to check out the heat again. Then I'll get to the communications. You know, we don't necessarily need to know what happened to the other crew. Come on. Don't drive yourself crazy. Hey, why are you closing it? Radio. Yeah, I didn't even wanna sleep. Leave me alone. What? Yeah, say a number. Huh? A frequency, any one. Yeah but we don't have any sound, right? Yeah, no. Is it hot as hell in here or is it just me? Where did you come from? No, come on. Why isn't this on the map? Now what's wrong? Are you blind, man? What have you been doing the whole time? Are those allies? I don't know. We're going to fly underneath them. Okay. Do you think they're transmitting? Wait. Here, here! - What are you doing? - That's them. Where's your radio? Forget it. Just forget it! But try to imagine if... I want to get outta here. And I wanna go somewhere. You wanna go over there? Really, okay, listen, there's a space suit in the compartment, it's not a real space suit but for a few minutes it'll do the trick. And you even have a helmet here. Put everything on, go through the propulsion shaft, push up and you'll glide right over, nice and smooth. What is it? Is there a radio in the helmet? The whole universe. So utterly hideous. No time. - All around. - What? - Just endlessness. - Take that off. Terrible. Terrible. - Shut your mouth. - Terrible. My mouth, I can't drink. I can't drink at all. I'll get you some water that you can drink. I must go back. Wait. The stars. They're going past me and further behind. Dead. Leave, leave. Leave, leave. Leave, leave. - Leave. - Drink. - The water's foul. - Drink, drink now! Drink, drink it, drink! Yeah, that's what I meant. Where the ship is from, is where this came from. Or at least where the crew came from. I read it all in the mission log. This thing is from a place that neither of us knows of. I'm positive, it's right there. Do you think there were more of these on the space station? Yeah, could be. And food, like actual good food? Probably. What else? Beds, maybe? Could be. Could also have been a bunch of maniacs on board. And could there possibly have been women among those maniacs? Yeah, probably. Nice women? Probably not. They would have definitely betrayed us. When was the last time you saw a woman? I was 17. Where this is from, there are definitely some. How do you know that? - I just do. - How do you know? It has to be. That thing doesn't get us very far. Tell me a planet, a set of coordinates, something concrete and then prove to me that it's worth it. Then we can look for that place, then we will look for that place. You don't believe me. No, I most certainly don't. Bullshit. Then where? When I heard that someone escaped, I volunteered. Not to bring the person back, but, rather, to be part of the escape. What did you hear? In the helmet. A signal. Some notes. What kind of notes? I wouldn't look straight at that. Just leave it be, as long as it's behind us. What are you doing? I'm checking out the signal. The old crew knew about that signal. Really? Yeah. They went mad. I'm not going mad. - No. - Just wanna know where it's being sent from. All right. Listen, I don't think we have to know where the ship was originally heading. You said you wanna go somewhere, right? Yes. But I don't think that's the right path. I think much more that... I'm just listening to the signal. It's not good for you. Did you hear it? Yes. Don't look straight into it. And close the bulk head. Do you have the light? What do you need it for? I'm looking around. Uh huh. What for? Now I know where this signal's coming from. Is the shaft here? Yes. And? Actually, nothing. Come back up front. Okay. Down here is where we are. The signal is coming from somewhere up here. Somewhere off the map. The signal, here, look. Do you see the weak wave followed directly by the bigger one? Hey, the big one, again, silence and just a little, it's almost as if it's... - Music or... - Music, yeah. - Singing or... - I haven't listened to much music in my lifetime. And it's not far. What do you mean not far? What do you mean "what do you mean not far"? Are you scared? I'm nothing. Exactly. Both of us are nothing. But there we're something. And this, this is the course. Hey, check this out. I'm almost certain that this signal should be carefully interpreted from a safe distance. And? Why don't you take a nap? A nap. I think you're the one who should take a nap. Sylbert. I'm not Sylbert. Sylbert is long gone. Sylbert is over and done with. I want you to stop calling me that. Whatever you say. If anything, you're the Sylbert. You don't even know who you are. What does it say, huh? What does it say on your name tag? - What does it say? - Leave me alone. Tell me who you are. Tell me who you are! I am Adem, sentenced to life in the black desert but after nine weeks I made my escape. I found this ship and aside from it, I have nothing. I have nothing and I'm searching for home. Rest assured, we cannot continue to follow that signal. Did you read that in the mission log? Did Cajus write an entry about that? Has Cajus ever been there? Have you ever been there? Adem? We can go anywhere we want. Yeah, that's what everyone thinks, huh? That's what you think when you see that out there. All the suns and the small worlds. You think you can go anywhere. But you cannot go anywhere. You're always going from one place to another place. - Listen to the signal again. - No. - It's not dangerous. - Put that damn thing down. I don't want to. We're always at one place somewhere. What's that nonsense? Always going from one place to another place. That's terrible. - Yeah? - Yeah. But that's not how it is at all. We're always somewhere and we can decide which path we take and where we end up. Do you actually think that? What I think is that we shouldn't go where that signal is coming from. I think we'll be better off going where this ship is from. We have to go in the complete opposite direction. And where is this ship from? Hm? From Earth. I believe that our ship is originally from Earth. From Earth. You think this ship came from Earth. The Earth, that's... the Earth... The Earth, that's not a place you can go to. The Earth, it's a tale that you tell small children before bedtime. Leave it. What was that? Turn the exterior lights on. Shit! Oh shit! Bring me the pliers. In the case! Hurry. You have to go around. Just go under, and around. How? The throttle to the left, push it forward. Get out. Get in the back. There. That's it. It looks like gold. Do you know gold? Where are we? That's all wreckage from old ships. Old adventurers, drifting away. What are you doing? What is this? The flashlight fell down. Well, what are you doing here? I'm just looking around. And what are you actually doing here? What did you write down there? A number. What kind of number? Don't really know. What, what the hell kinda number? It's here on the wall. On the wall? Yes, it's written here on the wall and I was writing it down because it's too long to memorize. And why? So that I can check it. And then? Just knock it off already. You wanna hold me back, don't you? What do I wanna do? Just say it. You believe those are the coordinates to Earth. Don't you? I... I don't know. But that's what you believe. Listen. There is no Earth where we can land, walk and everything will be fine. Can't go back to where we supposedly all came from. We can only go further and further and deeper into it. Now get the light. It's the only one we have. They were looking for something here. We have to leave. We have to land there. We have to leave. Is that a gas planet? That's a gas planet, where do you expect to land? Listen to me, what do we even want here? This is madness. And your Earth? What's that? I'm going to open this disk. Do what you please. What are you doing? Sit down, buckle up. - Listen. - Shut up! We can't fly into that planet. Are you going to kill me? You're about to kill us both. So, abort the landing now. There is no Earth. There is no blue sky. No fields. No seas. No trees. None of that exists. Shit! Shit! I'm almost there. Why are you doing this? Because it has to be done. You are flying straight into a planet made of gas. What are you going to do if the core is fluid? Do what you want. What does that mean? We have no business being here. What's that? The anomaly intensifies. Watch out! Incoming! This is the end. Do you hear me? This is the end. What the hell? What are you doing? This is not the end. No. No, just stop already. Stay here. What am I supposed to do without a pilot? Wait. Please, just wait. Listen to me, this is just too much to handle. You aren't thinking clearly. There's nothing outside. You won't find anything. Go. Go. Hello?
