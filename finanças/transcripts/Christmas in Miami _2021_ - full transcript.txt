[CHEERING, CLAPPING] Okay. [CLAPPING CONTINUES] - Okay. - [CHEERING] - Hey! - Hey! [IN PIDGIN] You China, Africa does not need your loan.

I need everyone to pull it in. One, two, three... [ALL] ICF! - I see you baby. - [CHEERING] Ladies and gentlemen, viewers at home, meet our contestants. From East Asia, the Chinese. From North America, we have representatives from the USA. From South America, the Brazilians. From Europe, the British. From Africa, the Nigerians. From South Asia, the Indians. So, what's common in Slumdog Millionaire? I'm sure nobody miss the slums and the happy kids running around. We want to bring out many kids from the slums, as much as we can. And of course prepare them for a brighter future. Single parents need help. A lot of them are widows and widowers with little to no compensation from the deaths of their loved ones. Some of whom died serving this country. That's who we're winning the fiesta for. A 100% of the winning goes straight to the Dasiy Williams Foundation. Winning this will mean a lot for your foundation, mom. Come on darling. When you think of Brazil, you think the amazon force and then the endangered species. It is the largest rain forest in the world and home to millions of living organisms. But it's not just about the animals. That population includes, 30 million people in hundreds of indigenous groups. We want to help save them by protecting the amazon. We'll give 80% of our win to protect the amazon. In China, rapid economic development and urbanization brings more opportunity but also brings more inequality. And more and more adults move to urban center like Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing. More children are left behind in the over-crowded countryside school. Where lack of access to infrastructure and relatives who cannot care for their child. Hundreds of family need help. We'll give 70% of our win. Mom, 80%. [MUTTERS IN MANDARIN] [SIGHS] We want to restore the last culture of evening tea. Because healthy tea time makes for happy family time. And healthy family time, makes for healthy discuss. And healthy discuss births grand strategies. In which great empires are built. Like the great British Empire once conquered half the world and brought you The Royal family, Royal great tea, Beetles, London fog. Like I said we will like to restore the last culture of evening tea. Like the great British Empire, I want to become a millionaire. Yeah, our charity is geared towards Street Children to School in the Niger Delta. Or as an extension, slum children to school. Also in the Niger Delta. The idea is to make sure that we gather all of the children in the Niger Delta and give them access to Education. For these children don't have talents, they don't have... - [IN PIDGIN] They have talents. - They have talents. What are you saying? - [IN ENGLISH] Sorry. These children... - [DAFE] I will slap your head. These children don't have a platform - to showcase their talent. - [DAFE] Good. Slum to School Project will help them find nourish and unleash their talents... - [DAFE] That's right. - [AKPOS] Yeah. After educating them. And this well make their lives better.

[UPBEAT THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT THEME MUSIC PLAYING] Tonight, representatives from different countries will be narrating their Christmas experiences.

A time for sitting around the Christmas tree, eating delicious turkey. In Brazil, like in many south-american countries. We celebrate Christmas on the 24th. Christmas eve. In China, Christmas is less about family, and more about friends. We don't go to Church, we go ice skating, you know... We do karaoke. India, such a diverse country with diverse religions and populations. We have that one day we wait for all year which is Christmas, where all of us will celebrate together. Christmas day is the time that we identify our wicked uncles. Because when you visit them, they only give you food. They will not give you money to buy other things to enjoy your Christmas. By doing that, we would show them the red signal. - [RAPHAEL] We'll then... - [IN PIDGIN] Yes, we then give them -our soundtrack to remind them -Yes - to give us money. - Money. Yeah so, we will now say, [BOTH IN UNISON] Eh... uncle... We are leaving. Uncle, should we get going? So they get the signal and do the needful. - [RAPHAEL] Then do the needful. - [AKPOS] Yes. [IN ENGLISH] My favorite part is the gifts. One year, my mom caught me sneaking down and stealing some early and I haven't gotten any since. [AUDIENCE] Aw... I'm sorry mom. [AUDIENCE APPLAUSE] [AKPOS IN PIDGIN] This is how their kids become wayward. [IN PIDGIN] Where we're from, our parents start planning for Christmas in October. They do all the necessary things, then get us our Christmas clothes... And get us our shoes as well. There's a way our parents buy us shoes back then. They make sure to get us oversized shoes, then pad it with paper. Just so the shoe becomes your size for Christmas. And also save it for the next Christmas or for your younger brother that is growing to use that same shoe for the next Christmas. That's how we exchange it.

I'm very much guilty. - Can you hear him? - [RAPHAEL] I heard him. - I'm guilty. - Dad, you're guilty and claiming it. Didn't you see me playing with the white lady before you came? You then used 20 dollars to match 100 dollars while betting. Oh, you thought you wanted to play a fool. So what happened, she won all your money, right? It wasn't just 20 dollars the lady won from me dad. How much did she win from you, then? I converted it to naira and it summed up to seventy two thousand. How did she learn Ludo? You had more than 20 dollars? She won 72 thousand. Meaning she won a hundred plus dollars from you. Akpos. Means you're the betrayer here. - [RAPHAEL] So that means... - [DAFE] You used 72 thousand naira to gamble in Miami. How did you get the money and we didn't know? Did you know Akpos had 72 thousand naira? Never. So at the end it means I'm in between two betrayers. - [AKPOS] What is this one saying? - Are you crazy? Who is a betrayer? Look, In Niger-delta, we are surrounded by water. [DAISY IN ENGLISH] Dafe, do you dance? Well I can step a little. What? A little? Hey! [IN PIDGIN] Don't listen to my dad, he's a king stepper. Hmm...

I haven't had sex. Are you listening? Being sex starved is a real thing. [RAPHAEL LAUGHS] What are you laughing for? My friend keep... This one is just laughing for no reason.

[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [IN ENGLISH] Thank you everyone for coming to this union. If anyone has an objection to these two getting married... Speak now or forever hold your peace.

Ehn? What have you done this time, Akpos? Dad, you know we do not like to be embarrassed. They embarrassed me first and I retaliated. What did you do? We did not come here to play. I had to retaliate. [IN ENGLISH] The last chance Pamela had with Michael is now gone due to your crazy prank at the wedding. We should have your crazy ass locked up for good. Hey Daisy, he's still my son. After what he has done, I'll talk to him any damn way I please. [IN PIDGIN] Can you see yourself? Are you happy now? You keep disgracing me everywhere. You are spoiling the little arrangements I have been making. I believe you're happy now. Er, babe. Babe, look... [IN ENGLISH] You are so uncouth. I invited you to the wedding and you choose to make a mess of everything just to humiliate me? And now you want me to thank you? Well, thank you, Akpos. [IN PIDGIN] Babe, calm down, just calm down. All I did there was because of love. Let me tell you the truth. You are not a simple girl, so I will not allow that boy control you. That boy and his family have a spell on you. [IN ENGLISH] That is none of your business. Are you done yet? Now listen to what I have to say. Everything you do is destruction. You got all the boys in trouble for wrecking this city. You nearly had poor Harry and his son killed. You caused a fight between the Chinese and the Brazilians. And I know of your airport escapades. You are the reason your family was late to the show. I can go on and on and I have barely known you for even a week. How do you even sleep at night? - [IN PIDGIN] Babe, please stop this. - [IN ENGLISH] Stay away from me. [IN PIDGIN] Babe! Ak-pos.
