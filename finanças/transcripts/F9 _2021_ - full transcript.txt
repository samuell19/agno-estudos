(MAN PANTING QUIETLY) (ENGINE ROARING) (TIRES SCREECHING) ANNOUNCER: That's the cleanup crew up on the track, and that's a lot of racers involved there, folks. (BUDDY GRUNTS) Jack' you realize you got this in the bag, right? Season's wrapped up, man. Doesn't matter where you place. I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss. Last two laps. On it! Get those plug wires! Jakob! Now. Hey, Pop. Tell me what you see, Dom. Got an oil spill going into turn two. Bell's driving safe. Corbin's got a sponsor in the stands, so he's pushing it. MAN: Talking about me? You got a real problem with car 23. Linder. MAN: About to whip your ass, Toretto! Settle down, pretty boy! That's right. Yeah, you. Shut up! You want to tell your driver he's gonna get somebody hurt? What'd you say? JACK: Hey! Leave it! Go home! You suck! He's just pissed I got that spot in the Busch Series next season, not him. Life's got no shortage of guys like Kenny Linder. You're good! It's not about being the stronger man, Dom. It's about being the bigger one. (ENGINE REVVING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) I swear to God, this guy. Pop, turn two, turn two! (TIRES SCREECHING) (SIGHS) Got it. I'm walking him in. Shit! (TIRES SCREECHING) Tell me what you see, Dom. He's gonna come at you for that. Get ready on your left. (HAUNTING CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING) (INAUDIBLE) DOM: Three-eighths ratchet. Three-eighths driver. Six-inch extension. Are you sure? (METAL CLICKING) Remember what your daddy told you. Be precise in life. It can make all the difference. Now, watch this. See how it's working now? And you see what's happening? LITTLE BRIAN: It's turning the screw. DOM: You're right. Water heater's out again. It's the price we pay for peace and quiet. Want to come and give us a hand? (ENGINE ROARING IN DISTANCE) Are you expecting someone? Brian, remember what we practiced. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) ROMAN: Yo, yo! We come in peace. We come in peace! It's me! Roman? Maybe you don't recognize me 'cause I've been tanning all week, bro. (LETTY AND ROMAN CHUCKLE) B, come out, son. What you gonna do with that thing, man? What, you out here trying to kill elephants or something? We would've called first. Except you actually need phones in order to get phone calls. You know that, right? ROMAN: Little B! LITTLE BRIAN: Hi. RAMSEY: Wow. You're so big. Hi. Now, I know you don't carpool. So what's up? Mayday! Mayday! My plane is under attack by a rogue agent! (STATIC) We 're being boarded. I've got dangerous cargo on board. (GUNSHOT) I need you to assemble the team. GARBLED: ...still alive. I'll explain... (GRUNTS) (STATIC CRACKLING) It's an SOS transmission from Mr. Nobody's plane. It came through with a mess of encrypted data, most of which I'm still trying to crack. Did anybody else get this? TEJ: Well, that's the thing. He sent it only to us. Why just us? He caught Cipher. But there was a midair attack, and she was extracted. It seems his plane crashed somewhere here, over the northwest region of Montequinto. TEJ: If Mr. Nobody survived, we need to find him. But the whole area's sealed off. Isolationist, run by military. We're not on call anymore. Wait, wait. Dom, this is Cipher. The woman who killed the mother of your child. Things change. Listen, we're wheels up at 8:00 a.m. if you change your mind. Thank you. LITTLE BRIAN: Daddy, do you know where God is? Where is God? In your heart. DOM: He's in your heart, too. And you know something? I'll always be in your heart. Hey, little guy. I have a gift for you. Your father gave this to me. And now I'm gonna give it to you. It's very special. Take care of it. (SOFTLY) Good night. This isn't who we are. Brian and Mia got out of the game when they became parents. We're not them. (ENGINE STARTS, REVS) MR. NOBODY: (ON VIDEO) ...under attack by a rogue agent! We 're being boarded. I've got dangerous cargo on board. ...assemble the team. GARBLED: ...still alive. I'll explain... (REWINDING) GARBLED: ...still alive. I'll explain... (ENGINE ROARING IN DISTANCE) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (ENGINES ROARING) Coming up on the signal, two miles. It's deep in the militarized zone of Montequinto. I hope everyone's ready. ROMAN: Ready? Y'all want to make jokes about me not making practical decisions? This is as prepared as it gets. We all see you, man. Nobody thinks you're compensating for anything. (CHUCKLES) LETTY: I'll take point. Careful. Careful's when you get hurt. Right now, we have a ten-minute window between patrols. Mr. Nobody's signal is close, but we've got to move quickly, guys. We do not want to cross paths with the military here. (BIRDS CALLING IN DISTANCE) (DEVICE BEEPING) It's inside. Cover us. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY) The source of the SOS signal is coming from inside this thing. (RAMSEY GRUNTS) (DEVICE BEEPING) Somebody wanted in. Plane must have gone down before they could cut through. Or it was sent down on purpose to stop 'em. Yeah, well, their mistake was trying to cut into it. But just give me a minute. I can get in. (DEVICE BEEPING) Dom. There's not a soul in sight. No sign of Mr. Nobody. - (DEVICE BEEPS) - RAMSEY: Got it. What the hell is this? Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody wanted us to find it. How's that work... (GUNFIRE) DOM: Go! (PANTING) (MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING) (MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH) (MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH) What? You don't know who I am? You think I'm scared?

Who's compensating now, Tej? (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) "Propelling mains." What does that mean? Tej, how fast we got to go to clear 'em? Please don't tell me you're thinking what I think you're thinking. ROMAN: (OVER RADIO) Why? What does "propelling mains" mean? Tej, how fast? I don't know, man. ROMAN: Somebody answer me! What does "propelling mains" mean? "Propelling mains" means "danger, land mines"! What? How fast, Tej? Assuming a 50-foot blast radius and a half a second trigger delay, I'd say about 80. I can't! My speedometer only goes up to 70. What do I do? You put your foot to that floor, and you pray! (SCREAMS) Get to that palm plantation, and then we're clear. (RAMSEY YELPS) (GUNFIRE) (YELLS) Whoa! Whoa! Roman, you good?

(PANTING) I'm fine. (MUMBLES) Wait, okay, I think I found us another way out. Two miles to what looks like a bridge across the border. Good. The sooner we get out of here, the better. DOM: Letty, on the right. (MAN GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (ENGINE REVVING) (GROANS) The device. (ENGINE ROARS) (BIRDS CALLING) Get in. That was Jakob back there, wasn't it? Always check your mirrors, bitches! Oh, my God. Oh, hell no. Are we supposed to drive across that? Well, I said it looked like a bridge. (ROMAN SCREAMING) ROMAN: Oh, my God! (ROMAN CONTINUES SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) The military's not giving up. We got to get past the border. (LETTY GASPS) (GRUNTING) Where's the bridge? No. No, no. Dom. (LETTY SCREAMING) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) Well, that was new. Look, we're in the clear. But this thing is a mess. The headlines out there? Secret spy plane crashes in a hostile country? Followed by some kind of covert ops firefight? I'll get you where you need, and then I'm gonna need to back off, I appreciate the favor. I got to stop doing so many favors. What we doing, Ramsey? Like, where are we going? I was able to decrypt the data that came through with Mr. Nobody's SOS, and I found GPS coordinates, definitely included on purpose. You knew about Jakob? Question. Who is Jakob? LETTY: Jakob is, or was, Dom's brother. Oh, my... My bad. I'm sorry. I'm just processing. Brother? You got a brother? Who also happens to be some kind of super spy with his own private army, who drives literally like a bat out of hell, who preplanned an aerial jump and landed at the bottom of an airplane? Who does that? TEJ: Who does that? A Toretto. (CRYING) That's my dad! That's my dad! He's gone! He's gone! YOUNG DOM: We got to get him out of there, We got to get him out of there! That's my dad! That's my dad! That's my dad! That's my dad! Get him out of there! That's my dad! There's a couple of release forms we've got to sign. Few clearances. Everything else is down there around the corner. Hey. Nobody's supposed to be around here. You Toretto's other son? You're the useless one, right? What is that? Get out of here. Go. So a man can't pay his last respects? That's what that is? No. No, not you. You're the one that killed him. No, racing killed him. Look, he knew that I was gonna pit him into the wall. He knew that. Now, I don't know if he dropped gear. I don't know. I swear... I swear to God, if you don't get out of here... What? What? Go find Buddy. Now! (LAUGHS) Oh. All right, well, now we got the golden boy. Leave. You here to make threats, too? "Leave" is a simple word. Man, what is it with you Torettos where you're all the heroes in your own stories? Look, I'm gonna tell you a secret. You, your dad, me, we're all stuck, going round and round in the same shitty circle. And we ain't never getting out. You ain't half the man my dad was. At least I'm alive, asshole. What did you say? Get off me! BUDDY: Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom, no! Dom! (YOUNG DOM GRUNTING) No, man! (IMPERCEPTIBLE) OFFICER: In here. (DOOR CLOSES) (GASPS SOFTLY) (DOOR SLIDING) (DOOR CLANKS) (HELICOPTERS HOVERING) Jakob. I simply cannot believe that magnet trick actually worked. It looked so damn cool. Look at this here. I got this off the cockpit feed. Oh, I love being rich. JAKOB: It was sloppy. He almost had me. She say anything? Nope. Nada. You know, I look at her and I feel creeped out. And sort of turned on at the same time. Is that weird? CIPHER: Nice operation. You snatched me off Mr. Nobody's plane midair without a scratch, and you took him down. Money well spent. Do you know who I am? I know who you are. Do you? East L.A. is a tough enough place to grow up. But it was your brother's shadow that turned you into this. Isn't it? So your whole life, you pushed yourself to be faster than Dom. Smarter than Dom. Stronger than Dom. Tell me, do you hate him enough that it keeps you up at night? Still? All these years later? I should've just hired you instead of coercing your brother a couple of years back. I don't work for the competition. That's cute. You thinking you're the competition. Says the woman in the box. Look familiar? The other half's hidden in one of the agency's thousands of vaults. I need you to find out which one. We secured the master drive here from Mr. Nobody's plane. The rest of the hardware is a bit dated. Pre-Internet. To make sure you don't go hack into anything we don't want you to. Say you get what you're after. A weapon so dangerous it shouldn't exist for another half century. What would you do with it? Launch some global attack? Sell it to the highest bidder? Or maybe you see yourself as a necessary shock to the system. I bet all you ever wanted was a hug. You read my psych eval. Good for you. I read your second-grade report card. That's what I do. (TYPING) Your chin, it's distinctive. I know the Torettos have quite the mixed bloodlines, but I never detected a Nordic strain. (CONTINUES TYPING) (LAPTOP CHIMES) Finding the two halves of Project Aries is the easy part. Add in your brother Dom to the mix? You don't have a chance. Plans are in motion. (SNICKERS) Qasar Khan. What? Genghis Khan's little brother. Nobody's heard of him either. RAMSEY: Talk about off the grid. ROMAN: I don't think they had grids when this place was built. If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me, tell you right now, I'm out. TEJ: No way this place was sanctioned by the agency. This was definitely Mr. Nobody's secret hideout. (SWITCH CLICKS) TEJ: What now, Dom? Whoever Jakob has become... ...and whatever he's up to... ...it's on me, and me alone. ROMAN: Nah. Whatever's on you, it's on us. Let's get to work. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (CLEARS THROAT) Y'all ever thought about how many wild missions we've been on? How we somehow always survive? (SCOFFS) Yeah. So far, so good, I guess. It's just luck. ROMAN: No, no, no, see, y'all not listening. Think about this. We've now been on insane missions around the world, doing what most would say is damn near impossible. And I ain't got one single soar to show for it? I mean, look at my jacket. Those are bullet holes from 14 dudes trying to take my head clean off its shoulders. We've taken out cars, trains, tanks. I'm not gonna even mention the submarine. And yet we're still here. Exactly. Ramsey, what happens when you test a theory over and over again only to come to the same result? A hypothesis becomes fact. But you're not actually suggesting that... I don't know, but when the improbable happens again and again, that's more than luck. Maybe we're not so normal. ROMAN: That's what I'm saying. We are not normal. Okay, um, just to clarify, are you two maybe suggesting that we're, what, invincible? - Maybe. - Maybe. Or maybe you're just a dumb-ass. (BOTH LAUGHS) Take your dumb-ass jacket with you, man. Pretty impressive driving out there. You miss the old life. Do you? (GUN COCKS) Every day. TEJ: Guys. We got a little company. Think you know this person. It's so good to see you. MIA: I missed you. Thank you. Of course. You should've told me. She deserved to know. Jakob's my brother, too. I need to be here. You get involved here, you put everything you have at risk. Your kids and the whole world that you built. We're all risking something. Dom, listen to me. My kids and yours are in the safest hands possible. With Brian. Our world's grown, Dom. I got this one. RAMSEY: The firewall on this old thing is actually pretty good. But, you know, port scan, UDP message peek, pop to root shell, and... (COMPUTER BEEPING) ...say hello to Project Aries. What is it? It's what we got from Mr. Nobody's plane. Or at least part of it. Aries was designed to override and assimilate anything that runs on code. Any computer anywhere. If it operates on zeros and ones, it's vulnerable. If you take Aries and upload it to a satellite, it'll spread like a virus. Then it'll be a matter of time before someone can control any weapon system, traditional, nuclear, stuff we haven't even seen yet, and just point it wherever they want. Jakob reboots the world order within minutes. TEJ: Ares is the god of war, right? If Jakob gets his hands on this, he'll be the god of damn near everything. RAMSEY: Because of how dangerous it was, the Aries prototype was recovered and split into two halves by Mr. Nobody. Both of which are worthless without the activation key. Jakob now has one of the pieces. He'll be going after the other half next. As for the key, it's... It's vanished. So, we find it. If we're gonna beat Jakob to it, we're gonna have to split up. Roman, Tej, I know a couple of guys operating out of Germany that could get us anything we need. I'm on it. Wait, there's one more thing. Mr. Nobody's transmission had one name connected to the key. You guys are gonna want to brace yourselves for this. LETTY: No way. That's exactly what I said. So you're saying Han's death is connected to all of this? He has to have something to do with it. LETTY: I'll look into it. Tej, can you send me all the files you have on Han? - Yeah. - I'll go with you. Letty. I got this the day Han died. LETTY: Mexico. Check the postmark. Whatever he was up to, it ended here. Tokyo. What are you gonna do about Jakob? I'm gonna find him. How? An old friend. (DOOR BUZZING) (BELL RINGING) (INMATE SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLES) (IN ENGLISH) Yo, what do you think? (INMATE 2 SPEAKING SPANISH) It doesn't matter. It's all about how you choose to see it. BOTH: Shit. I told you I was right. - I'm Leo. - Santos. Dom. What are you guys in for? Driving while brown. (IN SPANISH) (LEO SPEAKING) (SPEAKS SPANISH) (IN ENGLISH) You see that?

I know you took Jakob in after my father died. The worst thing you can do to a Toretto is take away their family. That's what you did to Jakob. You've got people who love you, count on you, care for you. He ain't got no one. You get in his way, this ain't gonna end until one of you guys are in the ground.

Han never mentioned a girl, not ever. (SWITCH CLICKS) Letty, Mia! Down, now!

(BEEPS) (DOOR BUZZING) (DOOR LOCK BEEPS) WOMAN: Welcome to St. Giles' Cathedral of Edinburgh. The High Kirk has a history stretching back over 900 years. Renowned for its stained glass windows, you can see the intricate craftsmanship... (DEVICE BEEPING) We're a go. (ENGINE ROARING) Ramsey, talk to me. What do we got? I pulled Jakob's biometric signature off the gun, and the algorithm I've run says Jakob's team is right on top of us. Anywhere between 80 and 100 meters. Eighty meters? That's a lot around here. This whole area seems pretty packed in. (IN BRITISH ACCENT) So, we don't know... (OVER RADIO) where the secret vault facility Jakob is looking to hit is, now, do we? Wouldn't be a secret if we did. ROMAN: (NORMAL VOICE) You know what? I'm starting to think your little English accent makes you sound smarter than you are. Man, can I point out that a good old-fashioned tracking chip would've put us within, like, six feet of this dude? But, nah, instead, we out here with biometrics and facial recognition imaging. Feels like we looking for Where's Waldo in Harry Potter world. Yeah, uh, strong argument there, Tej, but tracking chips follow the chip. Before we know it, we'd be chasing some expensive yet tacky jacket to the dry cleaner's. Biometrics, on the other hand, are impossible to... (DEVICE BEEPS) Wait. (STATIC) Guys, okay, we have a problem. Cameras are going down all around us, and my equipment is freaking out. (STATIC) What the hell, Jimmy? Security alert. Cameras are down. (ALARM BLARING) Damn. You see anything suspicious? Uh, where do I start? First of all, all of this looks a little spooky. I even seen these two ladies walking with George Washington wigs on their head from the 1700s. I feel like I'm in Transylvania or some damn where. (ALARM BLARING) ROMAN: (OVER RADIO) Ramsey, we're looking everywhere. I just grew a new bunion. This is hopeless. What? - You see that? - See what? The ears. They got cauliflower ears. They fight for a living. - Don't worry about it. - Roman. Hey, man, I ordered a pair of Crocs. Three weeks ago, and I'm still waiting! (ALL GRUNTING) Where are my shoes, man? (BODY THUDS) Man, we really need to work on your planning. Hey, Dom, you should get down to the cathedral. Dumbass here just attacked some delivery dudes 'cause he didn't like their ears. Wait, wait, wait. How much did you say you paid for that again? You know silver ain't magnetic, right? You know what? Just shut up. Ramsey, say we had a big electromagnet turned up right around here. Wouldn't that disrupt all electronic signals? Including security systems. That's it. That's how Jakob's getting into the vault. RAMSEY: (OVER RADIO) Guys? Guys? (SIRENS WAILING) Okay, we've got police coming from all sides. The area's locking down. He ain't using roads. (SIREN WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHES) (WHOOSHES) I got eyes on Jakob. (ENGINE ROARING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I see Otto. I'm gonna tail him. (ENGINE REVVING) He's heading towards a blue Jaguar. Okay, follow him. RAMSEY: Me? I can't. Why not? RAMSEY: Okay, this is a bad time to tell you this, but I don't drive. Okay? I never got my license. I don't know how to drive. And, you know, no one really drives in London. Okay? And that is not my contribution to this group. It's you or no one. (SIGHS) (ENGINE STARTS, REVS) Shit. Guys, come on, man. I feel like, between the six of us, we can work this out, right? Okay. I've got... (YELPS) (GRUNTING) Ramsey' shut it off! Shut it off! Go, go, go! Okay. Brake is on the left, accelerator right. (ENGINE STARTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GRUNTING) (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Shit. KIDS: Hey! (CAR HORN BLARING) (MAN EXCLAIMS) Oh. Sorry! (TIRES SCREECHING) Whoa! (YELLS, GRUNTS) Oh, no! (CARS HONKING) Move! Hey, that was not my fault! Okay, that one was my fault. (BOTH GRUNTING) See? What'd I tell you? Not even a scratch. (GRUNTS) Otto, sending you new pickup location. (BOTH GRUNTING) I've got it. I'm headed to you now. (GRUNTING) (WOMAN GASPING) (WATCH BEEPS) One, where are you? Jakob, I'm there. I don't see anybody. It's because you're on the wrong street. (TIRES SCREECH) (YELLS) (TIRES SCREECH) That's my car, pal! Dom! (TIRES SQUEALING) Go! Damn it. (ENGINE REVS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) You're a natural. (CHUCKLES) Of course I am. Okay, listen up! I want 50 of the best men! I want guns! I want wheels, freaking X-wing fighters, I don't care! The Millennium Falcon, Chewbacca if you can get a hold of him. Money's no object. Go. (SNAPS FINGERS) Go! (OTHERS CHATTERING) (CIPHER LAUGHING) OTTO: What? What's so funny? I... I was thinking, if this was a movie, this would be the moment where the villain has an unexpected setback, overcompensates without thinking it through and gets crushed by the good guys. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) No offense, but you have no idea what we're about to do. And, for the record, we're the good guys. Me? I'm Luke freaking Skywalker. Are you sure about that? I mean, I get the daddy issues, but... Look at what you've built. Really? Luke? You're right. No, I'm more of a Han Solo. No. You're Yoda. - Yoda? - Mm-hmm. No. The little green guy? Yeah. (LAUGHS) Ah, shit, I'll take it. Because he's a powerful Jedi, right? No. Yoda's a puppet. With someone's hand up his ass. (SCOFFS) So, what now, Dom? No one outruns their past. And yours just caught up to you. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) Man. There is literally zero industrial or weapons-grade electromagnets I can find that are this powerful. Look at the pull strength level here. - It's crazy. - Yeah. (WHISPERS) Wait, watch this. (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Every time. I can't believe it. What are you doing, bruh? I'm hungry. LETTY: Hey, guys. Oh, damn. Surprise. Nice clubhouse. 'Sup, man? Nice to meet you. So you got my postcard, huh? I'm just still trying to figure out... How are you still alive? Well, after Gisele died... ...I didn't know what to do. I was aimless. - Lost. - ROMAN: Absolutely. But can you get to the part where the car exploded and you're still alive? Like, I'm trying to... Roman, can you... Can you just be quiet for one minute? We made plans. We had dreams. So what's our next adventure after this? How about we stay in one place? Where are you thinking? Tokyo. We always talk about Tokyo. Tokyo it is. You know, it's funny, Gisele led me there, and I wasn't even looking for it. But it became home. Then, one day, Mr. Nobody came calling. MR. NOBODY: I worked with Gisele. Back when I was a CIA operative running the drug trade in Central America, The good old days. Gisele was my best. You can lose an asset at any time. Bullet, knife, wire. But I never thought I'd lose her... ...to love. (SIGHS) What do you want? I'm offering you a job, Han. Here, in Tokyo. Why me? 'Cause I saw your work with Gisele. I saw that she trusted you. And that means I can trust you. And that is very rare in this line of work. HAN: And all I knew was that I had to steal some tech from the home of a scientist couple. But, as usual, Mr. Nobody didn't tell me everything. In fact, he left out the most important part. I was 11. My parents would take me to the movies on Saturdays if I tried hard in school during the week. I was so excited to go I forgot my raincoat, so I went back in. At first, I didn't see it. By the time I looked out the window... ...Mom and Dad were gone. HAN: Turns out I wasn't the only one looking for this thing. (EXPLOSION) (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GIRL CRYING SOFTLY) (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GUNSHOT) (GROANS) HAN: Get down! (GUNS FIRING) ELLE: Han saved me. Wouldn't leave me behind. He knew I'd always be a target, so he taught me how to survive. We became a family. "Always be a target"? Why? DOM: 'Cause she is the key. Everybody's been looking for a thing. It was a person all along. My parents didn't want Project Aries to fall into the wrong hands, so they looked it with their own DNA, something we share. And then, one day, Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up that one of his best agents went rogue. So when Deckard Shaw came calling, we used it as cover. But you got killed in a car crash, Han. Mr. Nobody had a way of making things look real. Pretty nifty magic trick. Yeah, I've done better. Now for the hard part. (DEVICE BEEPS) Keeping you dead. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) My death... ...became the best way to stay alive. (ALARM BLARING) What's happening? It's some kind of hidden subroutine the system follows. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) OTTO: That's it, right there. Yeah, nobody moves, everybody lives. Jakob. I'm sorry, Mia. I was the rogue agent. Me. Dom, you ever think about how Mr. Nobody found you? Think he just dropped out of the sky and chose you? Iran missions with Mr. Nobody out of this place for years. (SIGHS) I've been looking for that key for a long time, Dom. And you just handed her over. I told you. This is my world. Got it. Got a lot of guys here. You trust 'em? Trust this. You know the only good thing to come from Dad dying? If he hadn't, I'd have spent my entire life in your shadow. And now you're gonna spend the rest of yours living in mine. DOM: Only good thing about Dad dying... ...was he didn't have to watch what you became. You never deserved the Toretto name. You think you knew Dad, huh? What, 'cause you were his favorite? You don't know shit! Okay? You want the truth? Dad died 'cause he was trying to throw that race. We were in deep debt. 'Cause of how he felt about you, he had to ask me for help. How was I supposed to know that car was gonna blow? A good son would've said no. And a real brother would've come to me. Come to you? He made me promise you would never find out. And through all of it... ...I kept that promise. (GUNS COCKING) The girl comes with me. Jakob! I will stop you. And that's my promise. Hey! (GRUNTS) Sue. Sue. Ah. - Come on. - Come on. (ELLE GRUNTING) (DOOR CLOSES) (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) Down! (MEN COUGHING) LETTY: Go! Go! Come on! This way! (MAN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GRUNTING) (CONTINUES SHOUTING) I'm always here. Tell him. LETTY: No! (GRUNTING) No! (YELLS) (GRUNTS) (DOM YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) (CHAIN CLANKING) (RUMBLING) (DOM YELLS) No! JACK: Dom. Tell me what you see, son. See, cars like this are immortal. '70 Chargers are designed so well that if you take care of 'em, they'll run for 100 years. Immortal? Just like a family, Dom. Build it right, you take care of it... ...it'll live beyond you. LITTLE BRIAN: Daddy. Little B. When are you coming home? Come... No. You know I'm good for it. I promise I'll deliver. (CAR APPROACHING) (CROWD CHEERING) JACK: I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss. Last two laps. BUDDY: On it! Get those plug wires! Jakob! Now. (HOOD CLOSES) (TAPS HOOD) You're good! (CROWD CHEERING) (ENGINE ROARING) No! (GASPS, GROANS) You came for me, Letty. None of it is worth a thing if I lose you. Do you hear me? Is this who we are? (LAUGHS) Yeah. RAMSEY: From here, things move quickly. Jakob has all the pieces he needs. Once he activates Aries, all he needs to do is send the signal global. And then there's no stopping him, ever. RAMSEY: He'll have to launch some kind of pirate satellite, something that'll act as an amplifier, infecting other satellites in orbit one by one. So we find him, stop him, and then we get Elle back. Our odds are zero here, Han. Satellite equipment is easy enough to track, but we're not gonna beat Jakob to a launch. RAMSEY: Which gives us a two-target problem: Jakob on the ground... With his own private army. And the satellite. Which can't be hacked. Not remotely. We'd have to do it physically, Fifty miles above ground while the satellite is in orbit. Orbit? We need help. Otherwise, we have no chance. DOM: We do it ourselves. It's where we've been that got us this far. No. No, no, no, no, no. Do y'all not understand? Clearly, y'all don't. Because if you did, you'd be pissing your pants like a normal person. Orbit. That's outer space. That's another level. What we gonna do? Hijack a space shuttle? Put rockets on our backs? That's exactly what we're gonna do. What? (WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE OVER PA) There goes my father's diplomatic ties with Eastern Europe. This place is going to be crawling with every cop in the city. Time to get the hell out of here, (ELECTRICAL HUMMING) Keep her close. (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) It's activated. (CHUCKLES) As soon as the satellite reaches orbit, we start the uplink. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Oh, damn. What? You see that? We can't have an air leak, man. Are you really patching yourself up with duct tape? Yes. I don't know if you've noticed or not, but this whole operation is Band-Aids and duct tape. Man, this is insane. We are headed to outer space. You acting like we on our way to Home Depot. This is ridiculous, man. I'm about to abort this whole mission and take my Black ass home. We're literally gonna be in a perpetual freefall. Freefall? What does that even mean? Roman, it means numbers don't lie. As long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay? It's just all math and science. I knew I should've listened to my teachers. Four minutes to launch. You fellas good to go? Yeah, we just up here putting a bunch of duct tape on shit. You know, that's what Tej do. Man, please hurry up so I can stop hearing his damn mouth, Yes, we're good to go. We're not good. This is the same car that we watched do a test run and explode. This is not smart, Tej. EARL: Don't worry, man. With my ceramic polymer coating, you're gonna be just fine. You're 100% fireproof. Exactly. SEAN: All eight thrusters fully functional. Hey, please don't tell me you're still running launch simulations. Virgin Galactic launched at 36,000 feet. The space shuttle tests around 50,000 feet. Our last test run with this load means we'll have to go higher, way higher! If we don't get them high enough, these guys are gonna be pancakes at IHOP before the coffee even gets to the table. Hey! We can still hear you! Don't worry, guys. We got this. We do got this, right? (TIRES SCREECHING) (ENGINE ROARING) I've run thermal imaging. Elle's in the armory truck. And I've got a lock on the Aries signal. It's coming from the beast up ahead. We need to get in there to deactivate it by the time Roman and Tej are in position. Ramsey, power us up. (ELECTROMAGNET POWERING UP) Satellite is in low orbit. Begin. (BEEPING) EARL: All right, we're passing 50,000 feet! Time to get ready, boys. ROMAN: What we supposed to be doing with these old-ass suits that ain't been used since World War I? TEJ: Oh, I'm sorry. Astronauts R Us was closed for shopping today. Listen, these suits are just like space suits. They both account for pressure differential. Only thing is we may blow up like balloons just a little bit. That's the only difference. What? SEAN: We just hit the launch altitude. You guys ready for a five count? ROMAN: No, man! I'm barely ready to go scuba diving in this old-ass thing. Don't listen to him. We ready! - "We"? - Yes, I said "we"! I thought you was invincible. Let's see how invincible your Black ass is after this. Punch it! No! Tej! Oh, my God! I don't want to die! EARL: Ignition! (ENGINE ROARING) (RATTLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (LAUGHS) We're in outer space! Told you numbers don't lie. This is crazy, bro! Man, how much candy did you eat? Well, I... lean candy when I get nervous. (ENGINE REVVING) (ALARM BEEPING) I thought you said you took care of this. Yeah. Hey. You take them back to the freaking junkyard right now! (TIRES SCREECHING) (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GASPS) (GUN FIRING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (BEEPS) (GUN FIRING) (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) All right, Han, Mia, you're up! (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Now. (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) Letty. (MAN SCREAMING) Han! (GRUNTING, GROANING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MIA GRUNTS) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Not all of us. (SCREAMS) Now, the satellite we looking for should be somewhere... There. Right there. You see it? Got it. Tell me you know how to work the thrusters. Tej, numbers is what you do, right? Driving is what I do. Two dudes from the ghetto, outer space. You know ain't nobody gonna believe us, right? You're right. Something's wrong with the satellite array. It's interfering with the uplink. I'll handle it. (TIRES SQUEALING) Han? Grab the wheel. Something's up. I think I can link into their feed. Something you want to tell me, Otto? My bad. Satellite uplink is actually going splendid. Oh, and, by the way, I have a new business partner. Maybe you know her. Guess who's out of the box, Jakob. But I did try to warn you. You were never my competition. Otto, there's something you should know. Yeah, go on. Lay it on me, dude. You're a spoiled rich prick, and I'm gonna kill you. Oh, man, I am so sorry. No one told you, huh? Spoiled rich pricks run the world. (GRUNTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (ENGINE REVVING) - Come on. - Come on! (GRUNTS) Go. (PANTING) (BEEPING) What's happening? Well, we appear to have lost our escort and Jakob. And, well, Dom is making things a little bit difficult here, but it's fine. Really, it's peachy. Don't worry, don't worry. I'll finish this myself. All right, let's see what that beast is made of. You ready, Elle? Crank it. If we can't break through, we stop it. (SIRENS WAILING) Guys, that thing is not slowing down and the download's almost done. Dom, we don't get out of here now, we're dead. Letty, drop back and line up with the front tires. What? DOM: If we can't slow it and we can't punch through, we flip it and we hit the underside. Goddamn it! Why do I have to say this? Flatten these clowns! (CAR HONKS) (GUN FIRING) Letty, the wires. You read my mind. Han, get in front of me. (TIRES SCREECH) Dom, I can't get to you. JAKOB: But I can. (TIRES SCREECH) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GASPS) (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) All right, the satellite is in range. Let's power up these magnets and fry it. All right, take our time. Okay. All right. (BEEPS) Tej! Hold on. Come on, baby. - Power up. - Power up. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. What? Talk to me. What's going on? The pressure of the launch, it must have jammed the cables to the power source. Damn it, how did I not think of that? RAMSEY: (OVER RADIO) Guys, where are you? The upload is almost complete. Why don't you just kill it? Let's smash it. Let's run it over, right? No. If we crash into that satellite, we'll probably die. And even if we don't, the fuel that it would take to smash it, we'd be stuck out here forever. You got to have faith, bro. Faith? Faith is not numbers. You know what, Tej? You're probably right. We 're not invincible. We probably just been lucky this whole time. This might be it. But you know what? If we're gonna go out... ...let's go out on top of the world. RAMSEY: Guys, what's happening up there? We've got seconds left. Let's do it. Let's go. Five, four, three, two, one. (MUTED THUD) (DIGITAL BEEPING) (ALARM BEEPING) (EXHALES) We did it. We did it! Let's go. Yes! Shit. Not bad, man. Not bad at all. Hold on! Dom! (JET ROARING) Yes! (LAUGHS) (ALARM BEEPS) (SCOFFS) Got to be kidding me. (BRAKES SCREECH) (GRUNTS) (BEEPS) Shit! (BEEPS) (ENGINE REVS) Think these belong to you. There's gonna be a lot of people coming after you, Jake. Yeah. This is the world I chose, Dom. You know, Dad wasn't perfect. But he loved us all the same. Someone once gave me a ten-second car, as a second chance. I owe you that, little brother, I lost you once. Don't let that happen again, okay? (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS, ROARS) (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (IN ENGLISH) We come in peace! Hey! (WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) This was the last place I saw your grandfather. This is where he raced. Did you race here, too, Daddy? No. But I'll tell you something. Everything I needed to know about life, I learned on this track. You did? I did. (SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE) It's all gonna be okay, Jakob. We got some rough times ahead... ...but it's gonna be okay. 'Cause we're family. (TIRES SCREECH) (CRYING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) - Fellas. - Hey. EARL: What? No way. TWINKIE: What's going on? (ALL LAUGHING) I couldn't believe it when I heard you were alive. It's along story.

Nice to finally meet you. Hey, guys. How much longer on this food? Like, I'm... I'm ready to eat now. I've been eating space food for weeks. Oh, so Tootsie Rolls are space food? 'Cause that's all you ate. It was fat free, bruh. TEJ: Snickers and Twix fat free, too? RAMSEY: I'm forehead hungry. Yeah, okay. I'll see you later. TEJ: Your forehead is overweight. (EXCLAIMS, LAUGHS) You drive just like your dad. I do? Mm-hmm. Do you know, this is... This is where I met your mom for the first time. Right there. She's watching over you from heaven. She is? Mm-hmm. I think Daddy has a question for you. You ready to say grace, kid? But I don't know what to say. Oh, it's easy. Just say whatever is in your heart. LETTY: You ready? Mm-hmm. Come on.
