The car is here and it will set out soon. Listen well to me. I won't be here from now on and nobody will listen to you. We'll move at night. You know it is the smugglers' way. We have got our fee completely. So nobody must take any money from you on the way. Look after your mobile and bags. Don't lose them on the way. When you enter Iran, a Moosa Khan will be waiting for you. When you find him, he will send you to Turkey. When you want to leave Turkey for Greece, be careful nobody lies to you about taking you on big ships. The journey at sea is very dangerous. Anything might happen to you. You might drown and die. When you arrive in Greece, the UN will distribute you in Greece. Taking women and children is a very wrong thing to do. The road is not safe for women or children. They might be shot by the police, and many other dangers. Anything happens to a man, he will save himself somehow, but it is dangerous for women. There is a car behind you. All of you 15-16 people must fit in it. Some sit in the front, some in the back, some under their feet, and the thin ones must hide in the boot. Don't worry. We have removed the lock and you can breathe in there. It is hard but we will get there. Now run and get on! Hurry! We shouldn't stand here. Nabi, go! Move! Hurry! Freeze! Go to the orchard! Soldier! Arrest him! Freeze or I'll shoot! Run! Don't stop! PARTING A Film by Navid Mahmoudi Come here! - Where are you going? - Tehran. - Where in Tehran? - Hassan Abad Sq. - You have Iranian money? - Yes. Here. Don't get on the bus. They might see you at the checkpoint. Sit in there. It is much safer. When we reach the terminal, I'll tap three times. Release this catch to open the door and hop out. Coming, sir! - Goodbye, mum. - Come back, Fereshteh. Take your father's trousers to the workshop and shorten it. - I don't have time today. - You must take it. We're going to a party this evening. We need it for tonight. Can't you take it to the tailor shop up the alley? No, I can't. I'm very busy today. All right. Where are they? On the shoe rack. - Goodbye, mum. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Thank you. I have a favour to ask. Can you shorten my father's trousers? Why not? But why you didn't take it to your workplace? You are a tailor. I don't have time. And he needs them this evening. OK. Have you marked the size? Yes. Give it to my father when he passes here in the evening. - OK, I will if I see him. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Bye. "Kiss me" "Kiss me" "For the last time kiss me" "Farewell, my love" "I'm going to meet my fate" "Our spring is gone" "Bygones are gone" "I'm going to meet my fate" - Say the number. - 0938-- Nabi, your sister is calling. Never mind her. Dial the number I'm telling you. - She's called 50 times since morning. - Dial the number. - Say it. - 0938 86-- Wait, Nabi. It is your sister again. Don't answer. Dial this number. 0938-- Hello? Mr Moosa? I'm Nabi Hezareh. Passengers of Mr Gholam Sakhi. Yes, I arrived in Tehran today. No, I don't know Tehran. But my wife knows. Hello? We are in the city centre. Yes, I know where it is. What dealership? OK. Sure. Goodbye. - You got the address? -Yes. Wait. Your sister has texted. What did she say? "Fereshteh, I know Nabi has come to Tehran secretly this morning" If you don't answer, I'll call your house." Call her. She mustn't call our house! Why do you call Fereshteh? Why? I know what I'm doing. Why do you meddle in my life? If they wanted to let me marry Fereshteh, they wouldn't bring her to Iran 4 years ago. You won't dare call their house! Why you meddle? I'm taking Fereshteh to Turkey today. We're going to Europe. Then you or her family can't do a damn thing. What? So what the road is dangerous? I know what I'm doing. Shut up! Don't you call her house! Don't make me return to Afghanistan! Don't make me bash your teeth in! Don't you call her house. What's the matter? Please tell me. Your sister has called 10 times since morning. Say it, for my sake! Something's happened in Afghanistan? My brother killed someone in a brawl some time ago. Then he ran away to Tajikistan. The victim's family want to kill me to retaliate. They tried to kill me a few times, but some people saved me. Neither Afghanistan nor Iran is safe for me. There are many of the victim's relatives in Iran. We must leave Iran today. That's why I same earlier. "More death in Greek waters! "More than 140 refugees died at sea when a boat taking them to Europe sank" "Most of the casualties were children and women from Syria," "Iraq, and Afghanistan" "Recently ISIS has arrived Afghanistan and genocide a new wave of terror after more than three decades" "civil war has caused half Afghanistan populate to try immigration at least once in their lifetime." I am in charge from Tehran to Istanbul. You'll go to Urmia in one these pretty cars. When you reach Urmia, you must walk for 14 hours to cross the border to Turkey. It is a hard walk. There are mountains and valleys. It is dangerous and unsafe especially with DAESH around there. But I can take you by the police station easily in 3 hours. - Your wife? - Yes. It is worth paying more. You have a woman with you. Pay more and I'll take you across the border easily. - I don't have it. - He means money. I know. I smuggle 50 Afghans a day. But I'm not from Kabul. You must spend money, but you all say you don't have money. - We care about the passengers' life. - But we really don't have money. No problem. You'll go to Van in Turkey. An Eskandar will pick you up. He has a moustache and a mole beside his earlobe. Remember that. Eskandar will take you to Istanbul. You'll stay the night there and see the city. They don't have a proper place there. You'll all sleep in one room. You'll leave Istanbul for Izmir in the morning. A pretty boy with green eyes will pick you up there. His name is Tarkan. I don't mean the Turkish singer! You will be 10-12. Eskandar will buy you pretty boat. Remember! You must buy life jackets. Sir, the boat is like the inflatable dinghies they show on the news? They all drown. No, Australia smugglers use them. We don't work there. We've asked the police to arrest them. They disgrace us! Make sure you buy life jackets. If the weather was bad or the sea had waves, don't accept to go. When you stand on the beach, you can see the Greek island. It takes 45 minutes to an hour by boat. We heard it takes 7-8 hours. No, they set out at night and lost the way in darkness. Your boat is safe. Its bottom is made of cork. You'll float, don't worry. When you get near Greece, they'll remove the outboard and drop it in water. You'll run to the shore and the UN police will save you. - Any question? - No. - Sit over there. - Thank you. You two! Come! Get in. Reza. Get out! Why? - You must go into the boot. - Why there? Just because! I talked to Moosa Khan. So what? We have so many passengers. And your wife must sit in the front. I told him I want to sit beside my wife. With your money, You're lucky I let you sit in the boot. Get in. Go to the boot. You sit in the front. I gave your wife a good place. Come. You too, madam. Hurry. Get in. It's getting dark. Thank you. Why are you standing here? Get in! What are you looking at? - What do you want from my wife? - What do you mean? Why did you joke with her? Shut up! Go away, hick! I had nothing to do with her. What are you saying? I'll leave you here. Nabi, never mind. Stop it! I won't let you go. Who allowed you to joke with my wife? Knock it off! Back off! - I won't let you go. - You won't? Back-off! Nabi! Leave him. Are you crazy? Why do you joke with a stranger? Why you let him laugh with you? Let's go. You must tell me which driver to go with? Any idea where you got out? It was near the road police station. If they caught you, they'd catch ether Afghans too. - Don't you have honour? - No, only you do! The jerk jokes with my wife. I didn't like his talking. You didn't? I must change the driver for you? He was a man to sit your wife in the front. Every seat has a price; front, back, lying under the feet, in the boot. He didn't sit her on his laps! Send us in another car. What car? They all left. The money is gone too. We must bribe many people. We must leave Iran today. What did the driver say? He is being sensitive. If someone tells you something in Greece does know Greek to understand it? OK, send us again. I told you to pay money, sit together, and go anywhere you like. I swear to God, we don't have money. What does it mean? All of you say that. Why you come if you don't have money. Please, do something. I told you. Pay 6 million and go to Turkey easily. 4 million for your wife's sake. Bring the money before nightfall. I have only one car left. Don't return without money! The recycling plant is in a ditch in Khavarshahr. I know where it is. I'll take you. It'll take a while. It is very cold. - Is it here? - Yes. Zofmei had sent me its photo. It is very big. How can we find him? I know him, but he doesn't work here any more. He left a few months ago for construction work. I must find Zolmei. Can't you get in touch with him? He just worked here. He's left. Please do something for us! Find his address. You live in Tehran and know how big it is. - How can I find him? - You might find an acquaintance. I know someone in that area. I'll call him. - He might be able to help. - Thank you. An Afghan couple are here. Do you remember Zolmei from Bamyan? Where is he now? They must find him. Well? Where in Haft-e Tir? Give me the address. It'll be a great help. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Thanks. - I want to see Zolmei. - He went out an hour ago. - When will he be back? - Didn't say anything. Guess in an hour. - Do you have his number? - No, but his friend works upstairs. He might have it. Hello. Hello. Dial the number. 0936420-- Hello, Zolmei. This is Nabi. Nabi Hezareh, your friend. I came from Afghanistan today. In the building you work. Got the address at the recycle. When will you come? I'm with my wife and must see you. You'll come in an hour? I'll wait here. Bye, then. What smell! - You are hungry? - Very much. I made you a sandwich. Thank you. Hello, how are you? Hello, sister. - You are Zolmei's friend? - Yes, I want to. see him. He'll be back in half an hour. Why are you sitting, in the cold? We're fine. Let's go in. Come in, sister. My-brother's wife and her daughter live in this room. No, thanks. You are our guests. Eat your sandwiches later. My sister-in-law has made lunch. We'll have it together. - Hello. - Hello. Make them tea. They were sitting in the cold. Let's go to men. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Tea? - Yes, please. - When did you come from Afghanistan? - This morning. You got a visa or came with smugglers? Couldn't get a visa. I came with smugglers. I was 10-15 days on the way. I was in the boot for a few days because I didn't have enough money. The boot! Let me tell you something interesting. I came in a boot too 3 years ago. What a mess! We were 4 in the boot. My foot in someone's mouth, his arm in someone's eye! It was very crammed, but that wasn't the problem. - What was the problem? - My wife kept calling where I was! - Which wife? - The younger one. The second one who loves you very much? Yes. She is very stupid! She kept calling, "Where are you? There is a woman's voice!" I told her I was in the boot going to Iran. Rajab was beside me. I told him to make her understand we were coming to Tehran. He said, "What is your wife to me? You answer her." At last he took the phone and explained everything. I told her I was coming to Iran to make money and send it to them. - That was my problem in the boot! - I know there are many problems. That's why I decided to seek asylum in Germany with my wife. Germany? What can you do there? You want to go on this dangerous road? To take a young woman to German? Stay and find a job here. You'll earn some bread somehow. I have to go. Think well. It is a dangerous way. My brother went to Turkey a few days ago to go to Europe. You saw his wife and daughter downstairs. I've been worried to death during the past days. It isn't a simple way to take your family with you. It is very hard. It is your call, but I think you shouldn't take women and children with you. I have no choice. Must take her too. It is the smuggler who took my brother. I hope it is good news. Hello? Yes? Ahmad's brother left for Turkey a few days ago. A ship has sunk on the way to Greece last night and 50 refugees died. I hope he receives good news. He couldn't sleep last night. Dear Fereshteh, I've been in Iran for 3 years now. In the first days, my husband just did nothing for a while. His brother helped a little. After that, thank God, he went to work. He got some money for a house. We could afford to pay for everything. I don't know what happened so that he suddenly told: "I am going to abroad. I told him not to go. Then he was gone. It's a few days now, I haven't heard from him. I don't know where he is. Now here I am alone with this girl. Ahmad, my brother-in-law, has told us to be here for a while, till to rent a house for you. Now we are here, until he rents a house for us and then we leave. Hello? Give me good news. I'm worried for my brother. The television showed a boat had sunk. I couldn't sleep with worry. His wife, his daughter, we are all worried. Give me some good news. When? Vahid was on the ship too? Are you sure? You sure Vahid is dead? My God! What should I tell his family? Ahmad, what's the matter? Ahmad! Why are you crying? Vahid died! He drowned at sea. The smuggler called now. Vahid died last night. My God! What do I do without Vahid? Why have you gathered here? What's the matter? Ahmad's brother drowned last night. Nearly 50 people drowned in a boat. - When? - Last night. They informed Ahmad now. - Who is that boy? - He's come from Afghanistan today. - What is his name? - Nabi. - You sure he's come today? - Yes. Hello? Where is your mother? Give the phone to her. Hello, sister. This Nabi whose brother killed your son, where is he now? You don't know? Iran? Iran? I think the killer has come to the building we are working in. The murderer is here. I'll kill him! He's killed my nephew in Afghanistan. Wait! What are you saying? He killed my nephew. I didn't! Who's killed your nephew? I didn't kill him! He had a fight with my bother. Run! Don't let them get away! They've killed my nephew. Fereshteh, run! Wait here. I'll go up and return quickly. OK, hurry. Fereshteh, call Zolmei. - The worker gave his number. - OK. This is his number. - Come back soon. - OK. Fereshteh! What are you doing here? You were to go to Turkey. - We were. - Why you didn't? - There was a problem. - What problem? I was short of money. I've come to take my money from Mr Ra'oofi. Why? Didn't you have money? Yes, but something came up. I'll explain later. I hope he gives it! Didn't we talk? And you accepted? I did. But you said you didn't have money and I accepted. But I don't need money in Turkey. I need it here in Tehran. I'll come up with the money I owe you. I don't have money now. You see how much debt I have. I haven't paid the workers for a few months. But I need it badly. I must go today. The driver won't take us if we don't pay him. I told you to go to Istanbul and get money from Ayden. There is no problem. - But Mr Ra'oofi! - There you go again! - Save Ayden's number in your mobile. - I don't have it here. I'll write his number and you'll get your money there. Hello, Fereshteh. Did you see the films and photos I sent you? Did you see how many people die on the way? Did you see the children and women's bodies? I know my brother Nabi loves you. He will listen to you. Don't let him go. By God it isn't a right thing to do. Tell him to find a place in Iran and live there together. I love you. It is a dangerous way. Don't go! - What does he say? - He repeats himself. - What does it mean? - He doesn't have money. Says to get it from Ayden in Turkey. He doesn't have money? I've heard he is starting a new workshop. Remember Neda who worked here? He didn't pay her for 6 months. In the end he fired her too. He hasn't paid me for 3 months. - He didn't pay Neda? - No. He doesn't have money only when it comes to us. He gave me a number in Turkey to get my money. - Who is it? - Ayden. He said he'd give us a place to stay too. First get your money. No need for a place to stay! See? The number is blocked. - What does it mean? - He's fooled you. He didn't pay you in Tehran. You expect him to pay you in Turkey? I'll go before he grumbles. Have a safe journey! Send me your photo from Turkey! Why don't you pay my money? Why are you doing this? Why do you shout? Get out! Why I shout? The number you gave is blocked. - Do you know Turkish? - Maryam does. Maryam is shit wrong! - Maryam - Yes, sir? - Why did you call this number? - I didn't. She gave the number and told me to dial it. You did wrong! I don't care. I want my money. I said I don't have it now. Get out! - I want my money now! - Out, I said! - I want my money. - Get it in Turkey. - You won't pay? - No! - I'll sue you. - Do anything you want. Get lost! I won't go! I want my money. Who is he? Maryam, call the police. Go, Nabi! He'll call the police. OK, mum. I'll bring father's trousers. I ran a bit after school. That's why I'm panting. Don't worry. I'll bring it at night. Tell dad not to worry. Yes, I'm going to the workshop. Take care, mum, ok? Sara is fine? Look after her. OK. Sure, mum. Bye. - It is here? - Yes, he said so. - It is the flyover? - Yes, he said this one. Zolmei! Stay here. Zolmei! Hello. How are you? I've been looking for you since morning. You had my number. Why you didn't call? I did. The police followed us on the way and I left everything. I went to your workplace and there was a brawl there. - Why a brawl? - I'll tell you later. - I need money. - What for? A smuggler is going to take my wife and me out of Iran today. - How much? - 4 million. 4 million? Trust in God. Let's go to the guys. I tell my wife to come too? No, where we're going is not proper for women. We'll be back quickly. Tell her we'll be back in an hour. I don't come? When you'll be back? Don't beat him! Leave him alone! They killed my nephew in Afghanistan. Don't! I'm dying. I won't let him live. Beat him! Don't beat him! - What have you done to yourself? - It's nothing. You've ruined yourself! Help me. I must leave Iran today. - Where is your wife? - It's just me. - Something happened to her? - No. Help me, brother. I'll make up for it when I get there. Did you get money? No, I'm sorry. What can I do? I must pay the driver and there are many passengers here. Help me. Please! I'll make up. You made trouble for us both. Yaser! Dear Fereshteh, Remember the first time people saw us together and we ran away We ran away to convince them we weren't together. To convince them they were mistaken. We ran away from people that day, but we didn't know running away is our fate till the end. I got far from you but I was close to you. Just like today, like now. I called you a few days ago and told you I'd come to Iran... to take you somewhere faraway to live in peace. I thought about nothing except being with you. But I think about everything now. About what happened on the way, the hardship I had. About the moments I thanked God you weren't with me. An hour ago when I was beaten for the sin I hadn't done, when I shouted I was innocent, I found out nobody would hear me. I feel like the day they saw us for the first time. Like that day, I am running away. I am running away so I can have you forever. It isn't a way I can take you with me, somewhere you can be beside me. I must go alone to have you forever. It is time to go. Goodbye. Nabi. Get in. Nabi. - Hello. - Hello. Are my father's trousers ready? - I'll catch you now! - You can't! Hello, Fereshteh. Hello. Did you get your father's trousers? Get ready. We're going to a party. Get ready, girls. - Let's play a minute, mum! - No, we'll be late. Hurry, girls.
