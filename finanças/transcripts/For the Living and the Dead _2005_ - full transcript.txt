The film is based on true events and ''A June Sunday Twelve-Fifteen'', a book by G?sta Karf SPUTNIK PRESENTS A KARI PALJAKKA FILM FOR THE LIVING AND THE DEAD The boys ran out. I was fixing the living room threshold. The birds began to screech, terrified. I got up, went to the door. Marja stood there. I knew something awful had happened. The car's on fire Marja screamed/. It's on fire and Matti's in it. I couldn't believe it. I'd parked the car right in front of the house. I went out. The interior was blazing. I didn't see the boys anywhere. I ran to the car, tried to open the door. It was locked. I shouted Marja to get the keys. Then I... ...ran around the car trying to see inside - but saw nothing. Just a blinding white-hot furnace. Marja brought the keys, I wrenched the door open. A terrible heat scorched my face. I crawled closer; it's less hot down on the ground. I shouted the boys' names, tried to grope the car floor. I wrapped my coat around my arm. It caught fire. I had just one thought in my mind. If the boys are in the car, nothing matters any more. I was just going to rush into the car - when I looked behind me and saw Timo standing there. At least Timo's alive, I thought. If I rush into the car, I'll die - and Timo won't have a father. So I don't do it. I don't do anything. I just watch. Where's Matti? I asked Timo. Suddenly the windows exploded. There's one more question I must ask you. -Yes. Why did the car catch fire? You said it was burning explosively when you came out. -Yes. Do you know why it caught fire? Marja... Want a glass of water? The flowers smell so. Want me to throw them away? -Don't. You won't leave me, will you? - I'll never leave you. Never. We'll let mother rest now, okay? When are we going to see Matti? We won't. -Why not? The doctor won't let us. -Why? That's just how it is. But I want to see Matti. Better to remember him like he was. These are all mine now Matti's dead. Marja. Marja. Marja. I need to tell you this. I think I know how the fire started. You understand? I'd forgotten a plastic lighter on the front seat. Perhaps it leaked or vaporised in the heat. Or perhaps Matti played with it - or it just exploded in the sun. But if I hadn't forgotten it there... It was my fault - it happened. I don't think that's how it was. Where's Timo? -Don't know. You seen Timo? He may be with your father. Henrik! You seen Timo? He was just here. Wanted a sandwich. -A sandwich? Yes. He was going on a picnic. And you let him? -In the forest. Timo! Timo! Timo! Jaakko! Timo's home. Jaakko. I'm sorry. I thought you were going to quit. -After the funeral. It was an accident. Don't blame yourself. The most important thing now is to take care of Marja. That's the most important thing now. You talk to her. She ought to take these but she's too exhausted. What are they? -Tranquilisers. Marja took some in the morning. -These are not the same. Kaitsu said she ought to take these before the funeral. I know my sister. -Calm down. Sorry. I don't want them. -Will you manage without them? I don't know. Kaitsu's a doctor, you know. Yes. He's a doctor. Please don't leave me. I'll never leave you. I promise. Please forgive daddy. Matti. Please forgive daddy. Morning, son. Morning, honey. Try to eat something. -My tummy hurts. Timo! Let's go! Morning! -Morning! Carita Hiltunen from the day care centre, I just wanted to tell you we have some of- Matti's clothes and things here, You can fetch them any time you like, Or let us know what you want us to do with them, Thanks, bye, Can you help Eeva with the Wallen accounts? Sorry. What did you say? I asked you if you can help Eeva with the Wallen accounts. Fetch us two coffees, will you. What's the matter? Matti's day care centre called. They have Matti's things there. Just go and get them. -Yes. Have you taken your pill? Perhaps you need another. Simberg! -Yes! Packalen from the Pori factory came to take a look around here. Can you show him around? -OK. Jaakko Simberg. -Mikko Packalen. Hultin, could you take this young man under your wing? He needs to see the factory and I'm a bit busy. Well... OK. Jaakko Simberg. Is Sgt Anttila available? This is Jaakko Simberg again. I just wanted to ask if the report's ready yet? Not before Christmas? All right. Thanks. Teacher! -Of course I told him he can't just... Teacher! -Hold on a moment. Yes, Timo. What is it? I must call my father. -Why? My bike broke down. He must come to get me. Didn't it break down yesterday, too? -Something's wrong again. Alright then. But be quick, the break's almost over. Yes, sorry... Dad? It's me. How are you? Teacher said I could. Where's mother? When's she coming? When are you coming, then? Nothing special. Must go now, bye. Henrik! Timo! What's up, guys? -Grandpa says he's seen a dead person. You see dead people in wars. -Grandpa used to be a sailor. Don't believe everything sailors say. Brought any smokes? -No. What're these? -Fire alarms. Safety regulations. -There's three per room here. I'll set them up in the evening. Shall we go, Timo? We'll continue tomorrow. OK? You've got a good appetite. Eat anything at school? Mother will give you more. Got any more ketspooh? I said, any more ketspooh? -You mean ketchup. Matti always said ketspooh. You always laughed. We're out of ketchup. Just eat your food, OK? He's asleep. I'll stop taking the pills. Are you sure? Whatever happens, I've got to think straight. That's good. Timo? Why aren't you sleeping? I'm sorry. -What? You got sad because I said ketspooh. I won't do it again. Mother grieves very much over Matti. We men must try to be strong. OK? Doesn't make any sense. They want test results from the manufacturer - and some expert statements before they draw their conclusions. And that takes months? Not before Christmas, they say. Waking Lazarus from the dead. What? -That. Please have some more. -Thanks, but I'm full. Marja. Have you lost weight a little? It becomes you. Boys, watch that glass table! Niklas! How's Timo? -Fine. He got full marks in maths. Niklas is hopeless in maths. Hyperactive, too. Timo's not feeling well. What did you say? Niklas, did you hear what I said? Timo... -Children are lovely, but they do wear your home out. Marja. -Let me cry. Come on. -Let me! Did you take your pills? -No. Why not? -I stopped taking them a few weeks ago. Stopped? Surely you can't just do it like that? How have you been? -Fine. I really miss Matti. -That's just natural. It is? -Sure. Do you? You? You? You? This is not the right moment. -When, then? I'm sorry but you don't seem to be feeling too well. Did mother ever talk to you about Johanna? No. You? -No. Well, why talk about it now? Mother never talked about Johanna or her death. Just like she never existed. But now I must know. Isn't there anything else in your life but awfully sad death? I must know. -I don't want to think about Johanna's death. It's my birthday and I'm alive! I don't want anyone talk about death on my birthday any more! Got it? Leena, calm down. -You calm down. You calm down. You, too. Look at her. All messed up and you can't do anything. I don't have to take this in my own home. Go away if you don't know how to behave. Let's go. Leena found these among your mother's things. Talk to Leena about Johanna. Pull over. Who's that? -Mother's sister. Oh, Leena. -No. Mother had another sister but she died when I was small. Johanna. -How did she die? A car hit her. I remember when this photo was taken. We're going to Adalmiina for lunch. You coming? You go ahead, I'll come later. Kaitsu gave the photos to you. Why can't we talk about Johanna's death? Tell me. Because we don't talk about it. -Why not? ''Why not?'' Because... Because... Because it was my fault that Johanna died. -Your fault? Yes. Mother told me to keep an eye on you. I was playing some game. The next thing I know Johanna's on the road - and I saw the car coming and... But it couldn't have been your fault. You were a kid yourself. What's this now? I don't need any of your empathy. I can manage. I've managed this far and will manage in the future, too. -OK. But tell me one thing. Is this why you wanted drug me numb at Matti's funeral? My own child's funeral. So you wouldn't become distressed. How dare you? I did it for you. For you. We're mother's little pigs, Every one of us, every one of us You and I, you and I We're mother's little pigs, Every one of us, every one of us We're mother's little pigs, Every one of us, every one of us You and I, you and I Marja, hi! Come in. Hi. I'm sorry - I just came to get Matti's things. -Just a moment. I'll get them. I didn't realize you were... -That's all right. There are Matti's drawings and plaster figures, too. Everything we could find. -Thanks. Matti's death was a hard blow to us. We all liked him. -Thank you. May I come in and watch for a moment? Now who may you be? -Just three little bunnies. May we come in to the warm, oh mighty Bear King? What do you say, children? -Yes! Christmas, Christmas, come to the children of the forest - hurry here with our bunny friends to Christmas celebration. Not even the giant Forest Troll - may be alone during Christmas time. Thank you for a glimpse of Christmas with the forest animals. And now Siiri whose cello playing - we've enjoyed before, too, at our Christmas and Spring parties. And Marja Simberg, Matti's mother, has promised to accompany her - just like before. Will Santa bring me everything I wish for? -Better make a list first. We'll see what Santa brings on Christmas Eve. Now tell me. A Lego castle, at least. And? -Can I have a Gameboy? And if you get one? -Crock 2. If not that, then... How about Skate Unlimited? -Look! Matti draw this just a couple of days before. What's that? -A door. Matti always drew a door like that. This is us and Matti's coming home. Or going away. -No. His feet point towards home. Imagine if Matti came home for Christmas. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Please don't get upset. I just miss Matti so much. Where's the wooden horse? -What? The little wooden horse. -I don't know. It's Matti's favourite decoration. Where on earth is it? Timo. Have you seen it? -No. Leave it. We'll find it somewhere. -It's Matti's favourite. It must be on the tree. -Matti's dead. Matti's dead. It won't bring him back. Give it to me! -What? Give it to me! Now! I'm sorry. -Don't you grieve over Matti any more? Of course I do. -You never cry. So? Would it make my sorrow more genuine if I cried all the time? Just cry sometimes. Be weak sometimes. What'd happen to this family if I was weak? At least we'd be weak together. It's Christmas time, it's Christmas time Everyone's having fun It's Christmas time, it's Christmas time Everyone's having fun The children rejoice, The children rejoice from morning to night The children rejoice, The children rejoice from morning to night,,, Happy Christmas... Timo. Thanks. A Lego castle! ...and a new wave comes. Fiercer than before. The wall I was leaning against shakes and sways. We just sit in the darkness and wait. Dead quiet, everyone. Men, women, children. Will the next one hit us? Is this the end? Then I hear a child's voice in the darkness of the air-raid shelter. Jesus mein Herr hilfe, Jesus hilfe, A small girl's voice repeats those words in German. Jesus my Lord, help us. Jesus, help. Soon I catch myself repeating the words with the girl. I think everyone in the shelter did the same. I don't know what happened. The fear was gone. Something inexplicable flowed into us. Some force, and I was afraid no longer. I don't know what it ought to be called but I call it a miracle. What happened then? -Let it go. It's Christmas Eve. I want to know what happened. -A bomb hit the shelter. An enormous flash. That's all I remember. You understand? I wasn't afraid any more. I gave my fear away. And my hope. They weight exactly the same. I think I'm running a fever. Timo's forehead is hot, too. Let's go and rest awhile. Dad will read you a book. Did I say something I shouldn't have? -No. There will be other kind of Christmases, Marja. Believe me. -I believe you. Merry Christmas, Henrik. And thank you. The investigation concerning your son is finished. Looks like your theory was right: the probable cause for the fire - was the explosion of the lighter Ieft on the front seat in the sun. The fire started on the right-hand seat. It spread explosively along the roof insulation to the back of the car. The burning insulation fell down, setting fire to the whole interior. All this happened very fast, probably under a minute. The victim tried to escape the flames by pressing himself - against the rear window where he expired. Did the lighter self-explode or did your son play with it? We will never know that. Or whether the lighter was in some way faulty. This is a pure accident. There is no penal responsibility. I'm responsible. -Not in the eyes of the law. Do you have a moment? I must know. Did Matti suffer much before he died? -How's your hand? Works just fine. -No pain? Sometimes it feels hot. But it passes. You must understand. Pain is the body's way to tell you something's wrong. But quite soon you go into shock and you feel nothing. Fire like that... It happened very quickly. Unconsciousness and death followed almost immediately. But he felt pain? -Yes, but for a very short moment. How long? How long? -Perhaps a couple of seconds. How many? -I'd say ten, tops. Ten seconds. Thanks. Do you have these in yellow? I'll take these, and that's all. All right, son! Wake up! Timo! Breakfast! Leave those birds in the cage. He's impossible. Leave him be. The Rabbit came closer and sang to the Tar Boy. And the Boy listened, la la la - to the summer wind sing in the trees, la la la. Thank you, Venla. Who's next? Timo, wake up. The bottom of the page. ''The Tar Boy said nothing.'' The Tar Boy said nothing. He just stood there. Then the Rabbit stepped very close to the Tar Boy and shouted: ''Listen! Let me go - let me drink from the spring.'' The Tar Boy... Timo! Back to your seat! Do you hear me? Immediately! I must phone home. -Shouldn't you be in the class? This is an emergency! -No, young man! Son! Son! Wait! Let me go! Do you hear? I want to go home to my mother! Timo is a perfectly normal boy in many ways. Clever, too. He does well if he wants to. But... under the circumstances - a special class would be the right place for him. Just for the sake of learning, too. This is the first time Timo reacts this strongly. Has this happened before? Well, nothing this serious. We all know that Timo makes a check-up call to home every day. We've talked about it among the teachers and decided - that we'll tolerate it at least for the time being. No one told the substitute teacher about Timo - that's why the situation got slightly out of hand. Timo also has trouble concentrating during class. Why were we not told? I was under the impression you were informed about this... We didn't want to worry you unnecessarily. As you... As you... Have it so difficult anyway? -Yes. Let's be rational. I think... I'm sorry. I can't remember what I was going to say. No need to overdramatize this. In Timo's case - the special class need not be a permanent solution. As the situation at home improves... -What ''situation''? Timo's brother died last summer and the first time the school contacts us - is when you suggest putting him in a special class. This is wrong. Timo needs the help of a child therapist and you'll write a referral. Or I'll report both of you for being derelict in your duty. Got it? Perhaps we'll reconsider. What do you think? One more try? Is it ready? Bring it here and we'll have a look at it together. Here's the office key. Bye, then. -You can come back any day you want. Thanks, Leena. But I won't come back. KKARJM MUSIC SCHOOL How can I help you? -You're looking for a clerk. Look at this. Bird shit everywhere. Let's knock out this wall. We'll get more space and light. What do you say? Let's not do it yet. If you need something to do - you can fix the threshold. -What do you mean? For the floor. Aye aye sir! Where's the drill? You seen the drill? Out of my way. Why doesn't this work? -Plug it in. You know nothing about men's jobs. Get the hell away and stop ogling. What're those? Phone numbers and such. I'm so absent-minded these days. I need to write everything down. Jaakko? What? -Are you sleeping? Yes. Does the thing about Matti's pain still bother you? -No. I try not to think about it. -Any success? Sometimes. Listen up. As a doctor and a friend - I suggest you to talk to our psychiatrist. Regardless of how you feel. Here's the referral. Promise me you'll see him. -Yeah yeah. Go and make the appointment. Thank you and goodbye. Hang on in there. I... Uh... Sorry. I was going to do something but I can't remember what it was. Were you going to make an appointment to see a doctor, or for the laboratory? I just saw a doctor. I think you're done enough counting for one day. I'll just check these figures. -Put the alarm on when you leave. Night. -Night. Listen. Yes? The Senior Engineer post at Pori will be open when Kiiskinen retires. They want Packalen for it. Take him here. Will you recommend me if I apply? -Seriously? I'm really interested. I'm going to work in Pori. Senior Engineer. Better pay, better benefits. More challenging job. Starting next month. -I don't know what to say. You could congratulate me. It's a step forward. -Congratulations. What about the house? Will you sell it? Marja and Timo will be staying here. Perhaps later in the autumn. You're going alone? -Well, for the weekdays. It's a three-hour drive to Pori. -I know. What does Marja say about this? Nothing. Take those glasses off when you talk to me. Matti's death wasn't your fault. -It was. Then you must forgive yourself. -I can't. You must. There's no alternative. Don't be proud. God will forgive you. You can forgive you, if you want to. Don't talk to me about God! What God? The one who let Matti die? If there's such a God - he's so cruel and incomprehensible that I don't want to hear about him. Or is it the comforting God you mean? The one who gives us peace and courage, just like in your air-raid shelter? No fear, no pain. What a fairytale! You want to hear the truth? The real truth? I realized it one night: Life's just chance without any meaning. We just try to bring some sense into everything - so we can continue to breath. My guilt is my mind. Do you realize what I'm saying? You've got it all wrong. Matti's not in that shelter. He's dead. It's you who sit there. The rooms are much too modest for an Engineer. This is fine. Food's ready in a minute. We'll eat when Timo returns from school. They need an Engineer in Pori. Work starts next week. We won't come. -Better that I go alone. Seems like you've decided already. -Yes. You promised me we'll stay together. Someone must tell Timo. Shall I do it? -Of course. Alright. Good night. Simberg. Where're you calling from? Can I come to fetch you in the morning? Good. We'll do that. Try to get some sleep now. Bye. What's happened? -It's Henrik. Something wrong with his ECG. He has to spend the night - at the health care centre. I'll fetch him in the morning. Has something happened? Unfortunately I have bad news for you. Your father passed away a couple of hours ago in his sleep. Do you want a glass of water? -Please. Jaakko. Henrik's alive. It was a mistake. He is alive and relatively well, under the circumstances. Your father had a heart attack last night but there's no danger now. The nurse's new and mistook you for someone else. Jaakko? Dad. Hello? Hello? Marja! If we go to the beach with the boys - would you get the blanket from Henrik. Oh. You took my lego train, -Did not, I saw you play with it, -I didn't take your lego train, That's my inflatable mattress, Grandpa bought it for me, May I borrow your mattress? -No you may not, Matti, Dad, Timo won't let me borrow his mattress, Sure he will. I'll just fix this threshold and we go. I'll wait in the car, -No, go and play in the yard. OK? The car's on fjre. The car's on fjre. Mattj's jnsjde. The doors are locked! Get the keys! Quickly! Matti! Timo! Matti! Timo! Timo! Thank God! Thank God! Is Matti in the car? Is he in the car? Jaakko? See you!
