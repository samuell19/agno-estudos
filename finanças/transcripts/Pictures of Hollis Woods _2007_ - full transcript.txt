My name is a real place. It's where they found me when I was a baby. I used to imagine it was the beautiful woods, surrounded by bright, colorful flowers, singing birds and a lush, green landscape. Truth was, it was a street corner in Queens. That's where I was left, one hour old. With nothing but a scrap of paper that said, "Call her Hollis Woods." By the time I was 12, I had been in five foster homes. And when I'd finally thought I'd found a family of my own, I went and messed it all up. I was always trouble for somebody. From the very beginning. Captioning sponsored by CBS and HALLMARK CARDS I want you to think of this as a brand new start. You're turning over a new leaf, Hollis Woods. She's a very nice woman. Plus she's an art teacher. Mr. Regan wanted you to keep up your art. I don't care. Well, I suggest you start. I'm a social worker, not a magician. We're running out of options for you, you know? You need to make this work. Oh! There you are. You're finally here. You must be... Hollis Woods. Hollis, this is Ms. Cahill. Hello, Hollis. I don't bite, Hollis, I promise. I don't, but he does. You'll have to excuse him. He's got very bad manners, haven't you, Henry? Out you go. Josie, it's good to see you. It's been a long time. It has. We so appreciate what you're doing. It's my pleasure. Won't you come in for some tea or coffee, lemonade? I'll just let Hollis get settled in. I'm settled. Oh, so she does have a voice after all. Oh, she has a voice, all right. I'll come pick you up on Monday, take you to school. Get you introduced to all the kids around here. You and Ms. Cahill, take care. Call me if there's any problems. Oh, there won't be. Good-bye. Bye. I've taken care of quite a few girls for Edna over the years. You can call me Josie. The last name is spelled C-A-H-I-L-L. But it's pronounced "Kale" like the vegetable. What should I call you... Holly or Hollis? Not Holly. Oh, well, then, Hollis. Just drop your bag anywhere. This is my place. I've lived here since they invented the spoon. Who invented the spoon? I don't know. The knife and fork people, I guess. And this is my studio. Are these real people? Some of them. What about her? That's my cousin Beatrice. I could make one of you, you know. We'd have to find the right piece of wood first. It all starts with the wood. Ooh, let's see. Oh, this might do... Hmm, maybe not. How about this? No. You know, these carvings take a long time. I can't start one unless you decide to stay. I'll tell you what. If you'll stay, I'll see to it that Henry here is on his best behavior. Do you hear that, Henry? We're putting it all on you. If you are an naughty kitty, young Hollis here just might skedaddle out the front door. What was I doing? The right piece of wood? Yes. It all starts with the wood. Here it is. I found the perfect piece. If that doesn't have Hollis Woods written all over it, I don't know what does. Oh, that is just right. Do you mind setting the table? The place mats are in that top drawer. Okay. I hope you're going to stay a while. Some of my girls have stayed for years. That little girl... she stayed the longest. I still get letters from her. What's her name? I'm terrible with names. It says... "To Josie, love, Jenny." Guess that's it then. Yoo-hoo. All settled in? Oh, did you draw those? Edna told me you were an artist. Who's that? Nobody. I like to paint the ocean, and the flowers I grow. What do you like to draw? Things that happen. Well, maybe you'll show me sometime? Here's some towels. And if you need anything... I'm right down the hall. Good night. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't bring myself to tell Josie about that drawing or what happened earlier that summer. Oh, Edna. Well, our little girl here is ready for her big adventure. Well, bye, Hollis. Have a wonderful summer. Get on the bus. Did you see that? She's having a tough time. All right. You're going to have a great summer. Let me guess. She doesn't want me back. I'll find you another placement in September. Look, Hollis, this family is willing to take you on for a few months and give you an experience you've never had before. Out in the country. Yeah, out in the boonies. Just try to enjoy it. Try to make the most of it. Just try, Hollis. ♪ ♪ Who's here to meet you? Hollis? Are you Hollis? Yeah. Hi. I'm Isabella Regan. But everybody calls me Izzy. Hi. And I'm John. So happy to meet you. Are you here to sign for her? I'll sign it. She's our summer kid. I think we need an adult. Yeah, an adult. Picture I.D. please. Thank you. Just sign there. You're like an overnight package. Steven... And this impolite young man is our son, Steven. Hi. There you go, Miss. Take care. Thank you. Well, welcome to Hancock. Our car's just over here. Where's your luggage? This is it. Oh, great. Well, uh, then we're all set. Let's go. You should offer to take her bag. I can carry it. See? She can carry it. Otherwise I would have offered. Hey, how about I drive? Ha. Yeah. How about you get in the back? What? I already drive the truck. Yeah, you're learning, and only at the cabin. Come on, Dad. In, in, Steven. In. So this is just our summer home, Hollis. It's nothing fancy or anything. Yeah, nothing fancy. Like nothing... at all. I didn't know what you liked to eat, so I have, um, turkey, ham or peanut butter. Any of those sound good? Turkey's okay. Great. Sold. You know, we might as well break it to her, Dad, It's not like she won't find out. No TV, no DVD's, no video games, and no Internet, not even dial-up, because there's not a phone. It's a break from distractions, from stress. and we love it, Hollis, and we hope you do, too. Steven. Don't worry, we're gonna have a wonderful summer. You hear that river, Hollis? My favorite sound in the world to go to sleep to. This is the old folks. Um... I'm up in the loft. And... And this is you. My mom's going through a green phase. It used to be blue. It was gonna be my brother's room. What happened to him? He died. Oh. Last year. He was a baby. Steven, your dad needs a hand unloading. Oh, Mom... Tough life, kid. Don't forget to bring in your books. I won't. I think Steven's excited to have a new friend for the summer. We usually send him part of the time to camp, but, um, we want the whole family to be together this year. We've never done this before, hosted a child, so anything you need... anything... you just ask, okay? We really want you to enjoy your stay here, Hollis. Adults are always hopeful about new beginnings. Time to go, Hollis. I'm coming! Later that year, Josie was hopeful, too. But not me. Morning, Linda! Edna. Edna! Good morning! Oh! Hold your horses. Hollis... I packed you a lunch. There. Have a fun day at school. Yeah, like that'll happen. Anything could happen. We could win a million dollars. Or get hit by an asteroid. Well, let's hope for the million dollars. Okay. Everything's all set. You're in. They don't want me here. Yes, they do. Come on. Your homeroom is 113. I know. I've done the new-school routine about a hundred times. Okay, what's your bus route home? Number seven. I get off at Roland Road. The bus lady's Mrs. Puzo. I'm not an idiot. No one has ever accused you of that. Hollis... if you want friends, you have to make friends. What's the point? I probably won't even be here in a month. We have a new student joining us today. Please stand up and tell the class your name. Don't be shy. My name's Hollis. Hollis Woods. Hollywood. No. Hollis... Woods. "Holl-iss. Wood-ss." All right, all right. Settle down. Hollis, is there anything about yourself you'd like to share with the class? No, ma'am. Oh, I'm sure there's something. When did your family first move here? They didn't. I'm just visiting. It says here that you're enrolled for the year. Are they traveling? No. They're not traveling? No. All right. Well, regardless. We're all very happy to meet you. Good morning. Hey, Josie. Do you have anything hidden away that I can take for lunch? How about a can of soup? Cream of, um... What is it? Those little, uh, brown things. Cream of mushroom? That's it. I don't like that stuff. I told you that... like, a week ago. Have you been here a week already? Oh, well, I am flattered. What should we do to celebrate? Oh, I know! I'm gonna take you one of my favorite places. What time is it? 8:30. Good. The light'll be perfect. Wait a minute. Is it a school day? No. No, there's no school today. There's a... There's a teachers conference. Oh. Good. Better bundle up because we're taking the Silver Bullet, Don't blink or you'll miss town. Sweet, isn't it? I moved up here about a hundred years ago to live with my cousin Beatrice. That's her movie theater. You like the movies? We get in free. Josie... Oh, for heaven sake. I missed my turn. Go around! There's other cars on the road, lady! Seat belt. Good idea. I should have warned you. Next time, I will. Next time, you won't have to. Stick around, I'll teach you to drive. Ah... I love this ocean. I like the river. Well, there's saltwater people and there are freshwater people and there are people who don't like either one... but they're not us. You weren't born here? No. I moved here to live with my cousin Bea when I was about your age. You'll meet her one of these days. When you do, you better keep you hands in your pockets. Why? You know what she did, the first time I ever met her? She said, "If we're gonna share a room, "you're either gonna be my mortal enemy or my best friend. Which is it gonna be?" Then she grabbed my finger, stuck it with a pin, and made me a blood sister. Crazy Bea. Why did you have to live with her anyway? My parents died. I had nowhere else to go. You have a wonderful eye. You have a wonderful eye. We have four wonderful eyes. Dear Miss Hornsby, Please excuse Hollis for being absent from school yesterday. Hollis had a severe rash. We learned that she's allergic to tomatoes. Pity, she really enjoys them. Yours sincerely, Ms. Josie Cahill. This penmanship is excellent. Did you know that Ms. Cahill taught here for many years. Here? And for someone who could draw so beautifully, her handwriting was awful. Oh. Take this to the Principal's office. Nice try. Busted. No way! Oh, yes, Henry chased that dog right up the tree. You're gonna make milk come out my nose. I hate when that happens. You're, you're making my arms so long. Those are your giving arms. Arms of generosity. Oh, I'll get that. Ms. Cahill's residence. Hollis? Hollis, is that you? Oh, hi, Edna. Why aren't you at school? No, but I am sick. Um... Go get in bed. All right. Drink lots of liquids. And rest. Yeah. I will, I promise. Let me talk to Josie. Actually, she's kind of... she's kind of busy right now, but I'll tell her to call you back. Bye. Make sure you tell her... Who was that? Wrong number. Oh. Um, I think we're good on candy. Oh, okay. Tomato soup. Our cart's full of soup. What we don't have is milk, sandwich stuff and food for Henry. Oh, good thinking. Okay, I'll get the bread and the cat food. You get the milk. Okay, done. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Josie, you left your purse where anyone could take it. Oh. The milk's back there. Oh, the milk. I swear, they move things around so much here I can't find anything. How long does this have to last us? Oh, a couple of weeks, I guess. I think we ought to budget. I had one of those when I was little. Bright green and yellow. Flew out the window one day. Never saw it again. Budgies... hate to be kept in cages. I said "budget." Budget, as in planning how to spend your money. What's left of it, anyway. Budget... Josie? Do I have a treat for you. We're going to the movies. What do we do for money? Who needs money when you got Beatrice for a cousin? This is yours... to keep... even when you leave. Who says I'll leave? Well, you didn't say you'd stay. I'm thinking I should. Well, I better congratulate Henry then, hadn't I? Don't tarry, Hollis. The future was starting to look bright again with Josie... if I could just stop thinking about the past. That's three words. Is it a book, a song...? I did this. Yeah, I know you did that... what's it supposed to be? It's a song. A song? Dad... this is a song. Okay, all right, guys, come on, just play the game. Hollis, do you want to play? No, she'd rather draw Dad making a total fool of himself. All right, ease up. This is supposed to be fun. First word. Oh, yeah, Mom, this is so much fun. You're an ape. I don't, I don't... Oh, sorry. I was just, uh, I was clearing out your drawers so you can make yourself at home. It's okay, I... like to keep my stuff together. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it. Night. You have a lovely way about you, Hollis. I'm glad you're here. Night. Night. Morning, Hollis. Wow. That's really good. Have you taken lessons? No. You mind if I...? You have talent. Stop. Dad, I was just showing Hollis. Showing off for Hollis, you mean. Am I in the truck with you? No, but you're under ten yards away. Doesn't matter if I'm ten inches away. You don't drive unless I'm in the cab with you. Okay, I'll put it back. No, you won't put it back because that would be driving without me in the cab. Why don't you take Hollis fishing? She's been waiting. I think that's a great idea. Come on, Hollis. Come on. Okay, they almost fit you. Let's see. That's not too bad. Sunscreen. How about oxygen tanks? Ha-ha. Did you get bug spray? Nope. Okay, be careful. Here you go. Try not to move. These fish are super intelligent. I think they're mutants. Okay, cast like this. Watch and listen. All right, you go. I got one! No way! Okay, come on! Lift the rod up! Don't put it down. Come on. Lift it up! Okay, don't jerk it! Easy, now. Okay, keep the rod up. Oh, come on! Don't drop the rod! Come on! Keep it up! Don't drop the rod. Keep it up! A little more. Got him! Got him! Okay, you got him. Let's go. I thought about letting you drown, but my parents would disown me. Are you grilling that fish or you smoking it, Dad? Hollis, this is the largest trout I've ever seen taken out of that river. I hate you already. This is fun, huh? Aren't you glad you came out into the country with us, Hollis? Don't worry the mosquitoes. Dad will smoke them out. What's that? What? That. You see that? Fireflies? You've never seen fireflies before? Yep. The mosquitoes out here have headlights. Morning, kids. What are you reading, Hollis? The Call of the Wild, by Jack London. Hey, that's a good book. But isn't that on your reading list? Um... yeah, but I'm reading some other book. What? Okay, uh, well, we're going to go get some groceries. Hollis, is there anything special you want? All right, well, while we're gone, why don't you read that other book? Okay, okay. Bye, kids. I didn't mean to get you in trouble. That's okay. Hey, now that they're gone... come on. Third! Put it in third! Where's third? This is so cool! I can't believe I'm driving a truck! There are some people who live life with a sense of fun and adventure, like Steven. Later that fall, when Josie took me to meet Bea for the first time, I found another. Well, look who's here! Hollis, this is Beatrice Gilchrist, my cousin and best lifelong friend. Not counting Henry, of course. Josie's told me all about you. You are quite the artist, I hear. I'm coming over and seeing your work before I leave town. You're not leaving for ages! Beatrice is going to New Mexico. She's going to paint the desert, lucky thing. Just take your pick of seats, ladies. School nights are always slow. Thanks. Ladies, I'll take your tickets right over here. Popcorn, ladies? Oh, yes. It's a special recipe we dreamed up years ago. Fresh butter with, uh... Parsley and chives. I used to sell popcorn here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, help Beatrice run the place. Did you get to watch the movies? Well, of course she watched the movies! You think I paid her? Excuse me while I start the projector. Crazy Bea. Oh, Adam, I've tried so hard. That poor little heart of yours. Beatrice lives upstairs. It's like a bowling alley up there. Can you imagine? Shh! Lady! Josie? Josie? Josie, where are you? I'm out here! What smells so good? I hope you're not cooking because Beatrice is bringing dinner. It's those, uh... Oh, you know. Those little, uh... Oh, what is it? Shoot! It's, uh... Delicious? Oh, you know. Those little, uh... Pasta? Pizza? Sounds like... I don't know, but it'll be delicious. Yoo-hoo! There she is! Supper's here! Chinese food! Of course. That's what we always have. The first time I ever laid eyes on Bea, she looked at me and said, "If I have to share a room with you, "you'll be my mortal enemy or my best friend. Which is it going to be?" Oh, I did not. Don't believe a word of this, Hollis. I was scared to death of you. She scared me to death. I said, "I'll be your friend. I'll be your friend." And then she grabbed my finger, and pricked me with a pin! Oh, I was 14, going through my dramatic stage. Then she poked her own finger, pressed it to mine, and said, "There. We're blood sisters from here on out." Well, it stuck, didn't it? It stuck, all right. Enough dilly-dallying. I came here to see some art. Show her, Hollis. Josie, you lied to me. This girl is not good. She's amazing! This gesture here. Revelation! Through a detail like that, that is the sign of an artist. Interesting choice... Well, this is my favorite. Of course. Where's the phone? I can't find the phone! Josie, it's the door. Oh. Oh, wait! Josie, don't answer. Oh, hello. Hello. What a surprise. Well, I bet it is. Hollis, is there any reason you aren't at school again? School? I guess we overslept. Oh, it's my fault. I kept her up late last night watching old movies. I thought it was your tomato allergy acting up. You poor thing. Why didn't you tell me? I've been feeding her tomatoes up to the eyebrows. You didn't even tell her I rang the other day, either, did you? Can I make you some tea? No tea, thank you. You have two minutes to get dressed and ready for school. Which is where she's supposed to be, Josie, every day, unless she's got a legitimate excuse. These are envelopes. They are addressed to me. They don't need any postage. Every week, Hollis needs to give you a completed attendance card. And every week, you need to get those cards to me without fail. Oh, okay. Without fail. Hurry. It's my fault. I told Josie it was a school holiday. Oh. Oh, I thought that was last week. Okay. Come on. I'm not sure this is working out. But I like it here. I'll go to school. Every day. I'll get good grades. You'll see. Okay. I guess we will. You need to work on your spelling, Craig. Okay. You didn't read the assignment, did you? Uh, I started to... And, Hollis? Nice work. If I really tried, I could make things work. It was such a cool feeling. I hadn't felt that way since summertime. Be careful climbing up. This is my favorite spot. Hmm... wonder if I should give you half or eat it all myself? You should give me the whole thing. I deserve it. That's what Dad would say. You guys fight a lot, huh? Yeah. He's getting worse. Doesn't want me to do anything on my own. Big or little? Which hand? That one. Little. Yeah, that was a good one, Mom. It was hilarious. Hey. Hey... I found this in old box of some things of mine. I want you to have it. Izzy... Yeah? I'm gonna go fix that old screen door. Ah, you're my hero. Steven, why don't you come with me? Do I have to? Come on, buddy. Let's go. Hey, Steven, here... hold this. It's not quite finished yet. Well, it's already beautiful. I've still got a lot to do. I've never had so many colors to work with. You know, my mother gave me that drawing kit for my tenth birthday. I could draw killer spaceships. But never people. Beautiful. With Steven and Mr. Regan, I never knew what to expect. Months later, the same was true with Josie and Bea. Yoo-hoo! Honey! Bea. Josie, I need your mega-size suitcase. I sat on mine, tried to force it. Broke the zipper. Oh, no. Uh, Hollis... could you get the suitcase? Where is it? Uh... Is it in the closet? Oh. Holy cow, Josie. You need to clean this out. Got it. Where are you off to? Are you kidding? New Mexico to paint the desert. We've been talking about it for ages. Oh... right. Are you all right? I'm fine. Josie, if you're not all right, I'll postpone. Beatrice, I'm fine. You sure? Of course I'm sure. What more do you want me to say? Okay. You can always call me if there's a problem. Exactly. I'll write down my cell. Beatrice, I know your number. You've had the same one forever. Have fun. And say hello to Georgia O'Keefe for me. Oh, you are all right, you silly thing. Of course I am. Just ask Henry. Call me if you need anything. We will. Hollis. Adios... amigas. Crazy Bea. What are you doing? Cleaning the closet. Can you... help me... move this? Everything looks pretty good, Josie. I think you've done it. For now. I have an idea. How about we go to bed? Good idea. I'll tuck you in. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. See you next year. Next year? Oh, yeah, next year. Merry Christmas. Hollis. I was in school. I just got off the bus. You can check. Linda and I were just visiting over tea. Edna. And you'll never guess what I did. You know those... forms I was supposed to mail? To Edna... Well, I mailed the gas payment instead. Have you ever heard of anything so dumb? The gas company is probably reading your attendance record right now. It's not a big deal. It was just the wrong envelope. That could happen to anyone. I know. I know. Hollis, Josie and I were just talking, and we both agree that maybe it's time for a change. What do you mean? Don't you want me anymore? Is Hollis leaving? That's what we were just talking about. I'd like to talk to Hollis outside for a moment. Josie, thanks again for the tea. It was delicious. Why didn't you tell me what was going on here? What? You know what I'm talking about. I'm not going. Hollis... Ms. Cahill is supposed to be taking care of you. She is. She just forgets stuff sometimes. You don't know Josie. I've known her for 20 years. This is something more than just forgetfulness. She has a serious problem. It's only going to get worse, sweetie. Ms. Cahill cannot be responsible for you anymore. I finally found a place I like, and now you're just dragging me away. I'm not dragging you. You'll have time to say good-bye tonight. I'll come for you in the morning, okay? To go where? You'll go to the shelter, until we can find you another placement. I am so sorry this didn't work out. I promise you can come and visit. I'll come and get you at 9:00 in the morning. Have your bag packed. Come on. Get in the house. No. Josie, we have to get out of here. We have to pack. We have to go. With Henry? Yeah, with Henry. And cat food. And your toothbrush. And we've got to call Bea. This is an emergency. Call Bea. Josie... Josie, they're going to take me away. And I can't leave you alone. What's Bea's number? What's Bea's number? What is Bea's number? What's her number? Uh... 5... 5... 55... 2 552... Josie... We're going to a cabin for Christmas. There's no one there. It'll be just you and me and... and Henry. Can we... can we go tomorrow? No. We have to go now. Get my pillow. There's your pillow. Okay, come on, let's go. We have to go now. We have to... We have to go now. It'll be all right. Let's go. ♪ ♪ We haven't passed the exit? What exit? For Route 17. Hang on, Josie. You can sleep all you want once we get there. There it is. Next right. Where are we going? To our cabin. Oh. Can't wait to see Beatrice. First time I laid eyes on her I had to... You had to share a room with Bea. That's what happened. Somebody died and I had to share a room with Bea. She said, "You're either going to be my best friend or my mortal enemy." And you chose friend. And she... pricked her finger with a pin and she did the same with yours. Pressed them together... blood sisters. Crazy Bea. It seemed much easier to help Josie recall her memories than to think of my own. Hey. Can I help? Yeah. You want to dry? Thanks. This was my mom's china. It's all cracked and chipped, but I love it anyway. We had 12 of these plates when I was a kid. Down to five. Steven breaks things. We always wanted lots of kids. It's not going to happen for us, so... I especially wanted it for Steven. Means a lot to us... you being here this summer.

Do you know what time it is? Is it late? Sorry. I was drawing the valley for Izzy. Kissing up already. Get in. Whatever you do, don't tell Dad about the truck, okay? He'll freak. Slow down. I know. Slow down! I know, I'm trying. Steven, slow down! I'm trying! I was always told I brought trouble to the people around me. The way that summer ended had finally made me believe it. Come on. Josie, I didn't catch anything. Josie? Josie? Josie! Josie! Josie? Josie? Josie? Josie?! Josie?! One more time I was responsible for losing everything that meant the most to me. Responsible for messing things up again. How's Steven? Steven Regan? How is he? It's going to be okay, honey. Just relax. He's going to be fine. Let's get a full CT with contrast. How's Steven? How are you feeling, huh? Where is he? Um, they're just... they're keeping a real close eye on him. Please tell Mr. Regan not to be mad at him. It wasn't his fault, it was mine... it was all because of me. I was late. I told him to bring the truck. Nobody... nobody's blaming anybody, okay? Nobody. Okay, you lay your head back down. You try to get some rest, all right? You're okay. Ma'am, I just found this. Thank you. I'll go check with security. "Mr. and Mrs. Regan, "I'm sorry Steven was hurt so badly. "I don't think I should stay with you anymore... "I'm sorry for messing up your family. "I don't want to love anybody anymore, "and I don't want anybody to love me. Yours sincerely, Hollis Woods." Hey, kid. Hey. Kid, wake up. Every time I see her, she asks about your son. Hollis so clearly belongs in your family, but I've got to warn you, she's on the run emotionally and I've had a hard time reaching her. Holly. Mr. Regan drove all the way from Hancock to see you. Steven is coming home soon. He's going to be okay. He and Izzy send their love. Oh, and I brought you something that's yours. Here's your pictures and your pencils. Look, Hollis... I need you to understand something. No one blames you for what happened. Okay? You're part of our family and we love you. You see? See that? That's where you belong. We want you to come back home. I think I'll stay here. What, what is going on in your mind, Holly? Believe me, whatever it is, we can all work through it together. We love you, Holly. I don't know what to say. Well, will you stay in touch with us and let us know how she's doing? Yeah. Maybe she'll change her mind. I have had sympathy for you, Hollis Woods. I realize that you have had some hard knocks early on, but I am going to tell you the truth, my dear. Are you listening? You're a coward. When things aren't perfect, you run. Where did you get the idea that families are supposed to be perfect? That's real. Let me tell you something that I do know. And trust me, I know it for sure. You got to take a chance, Hollis. You got to be willing to risk. Don't think that I don't see you. I know you. I have known you a long time. I know that you try to play it safe. If you don't risk anything, you won't lose anything. Look at me. Hollis, here's the hard fact. Every one of us will eventually lose everyone we love. So there's no time to waste. Edna was right, I had lost the Regans. That day in the woods, I didn't want to lose Josie, too. Look, I found us a Christmas tree. Let's go decorate it. This goes on top. Oh, look at this. Isn't it ugly? Ooh, I like this. Holly for my Hollis. You know how I got my name? It's... it's, uh... a real place... in Queens. That's where they found me. Just an hour old. And look at you now. Oh! Oh. Sit down and close your eyes. Close them. No peeking. Okay? Okay. It's from Santa. Oh. It's beautiful. She has your long giving arms and your beautiful wild hair. You think she looks like you? She's not as tough. Wish you could see yourself the way I do. Oh, you close your eyes now. Oh... They're closed. Okay. Open. Oh... That's you and Bea. You've made us look so young and glamorous. Oh, I miss Bea. I know. She remembers things for me. I forget things, Hollis. Sometimes things seem so clear and then... I'm scared. Never been sick a day in my life. You're not sick. Everyone forgets stuff sometimes. It's more than forgetting. I don't think I can take care of you anymore. But I love you. I love you, too. But I need to go home. The river's nice, but I need my ocean. Okay. We'll go home tomorrow. Ready to go? Almost. Josie? What? Did you... did you board that up? No. That was... uh... that was a friend. What friend? Oh, you just missed him. Oh. Uh... Oh, he... he left... he left you something. A candy bar. Steven! Wait! Why are you running away? Why didn't you let me know you were here? I didn't want to scare you off. Last time you saw Dad, you told him to take a flying hike. I messed up everything. For you and Izzy and John. Hollis, you are so thick sometimes. How did you know I was here? Ms. Reilly called us. Edna. She said you were a missing person. She was hoping we'd know where you were. I told Dad you'd be right here at the cabin. Did he listen? No. He went to Long Island with Edna to find you. Edna and John are out looking for me? I missed you, Holly. I missed you, too. I missed all of you. Well, then can we let the folks know what's going on? Are you ready for this? She's gonna freak. Hello? Hey, Mom, it's me. Can you drive out to the cabin right away? The cabin? What's going on at the cabin? Are you okay? No, no, Mom, Mom. I'm fine. Is the cabin okay? Yes, the cabin's fine, too. So is Hollis. Oh, my gosh! Hollis? You're with Hollis? Is she okay? Holly. I'm really sorry. I know I should've asked... No, no, no, no. It's okay. Everything's okay now. Is it all right if I come home? Are you kidding me? Of course you're coming home. I'd like you to meet my best friend. Okay. She's inside. So you're gonna be here and Hollis and who else? Um, Steven and my husband John. I told you about John. Edna, you know Edna. So we'll all be here together and it should be lovely. That's right, we'll have a little party. I don't know why I don't do this more often. Ms. Reilly and Dad are here. Oh, great, that's my husband I told you about and Edna. Oh, yes. And Edna. Hey. Oh, Hollis. I missed you so much. I have something I want to say to Edna. Okay. Thank you. Henry's been my buddy for a long time. Nice fire, Dad. Haven't you, Henry? Your eyes match. Oh, that's awesome. Hey, could you make one of me? Oh, well, these things take time, you know. I love this tree. Me, too. Oh, hang on. Excuse me. Hello? Hey, is Josie there? Yes, she is right here. They both are, and they're fine. Good. May I talk to her? Josie... I have someone here who wants to talk to you. Oh, well, thank you. Hello? The whole world's been looking for you. Beatrice? Where are you? I'm on my way. And I think it's time we lived together again, like we did when we were kids. That sounds nice. Only this time we each get our own rooms. Crazy Bea. Who's with you now? Oh, I'm with Hollis and, uh... let's see, uh... Oh, I don't know, Bea, but they seem like very nice people. How's your Christmas? Oh, we had a good Christmas. But Henry and I are ready to come home now. Well, I can't wait. I'll see you tonight. Okay, Bea. Good-bye. It's Beatrice. Was it? That was Beatrice. Josie went home to Bea and I went home with the Regans. It was a very merry Christmas. I have a new last name now... Hollis Woods Regan... and I love the sound of it. I still visit Josie Cahill. She doesn't exactly remember who I am, but sometimes I see recognition in her eyes. "Hollis," she says, "you saved my life." And I always tell her it was the other way around.
