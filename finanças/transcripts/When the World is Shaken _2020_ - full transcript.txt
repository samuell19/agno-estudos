Fear and anxiety grip the nation as the unknown cost of life and living loom in the balance. [Graham] How do you respond when your world is shaken? When the storms of life leave you desperate? The storm that is affecting the world today, the coronavirus, is incredible. It has changed our country, it's changed the world, and who knows the impact this is going to have on the economy, on people's lives for years to come. Many people are afraid. Their hearts have melted. They don't know what to do, where to go. And maybe that's you. Maybe you are afraid, and maybe you're not sure what your future holds. But I'm here to tell you, God loves you. You know, in life, we all go through storms, don't we? There are people that have had financial crises, or health crises, or marriage crises. There's many storms. The Lord Jesus Himself was caught in a storm. And today I want to take a look at Matthew 8, at a storm that terrified Jesus' closest friends. Jesus and His disciples get into a boat. They're going to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus was tired. He'd been ministering all day, and He was just physically worn out. So He goes into the boat, and He lays down and sleeps, and the disciples are experienced fishermen. These guys grew up on a boat. They grew up on the Sea of Galilee. They knew everything about sailing, fishing, rowing boats. It was their life. This wasn't strange to them. And all of a sudden, they find themselves in a storm. [thunder rumbles] The storm is violent. And I believe the devil was wanting to destroy the Lord Jesus Christ and destroy His disciples that evening. And the disciples thought they could handle this storm on their own. 'Course they were experienced, they knew how to do this. They'd been in storms before, that was nothing new. But this was different. And the waves were now crashing over the boat. It was filling the boat; the boat was sinking. The disciples were afraid. They're about to lose the boat. They were gonna drown. And maybe you feel that you've lost your savings, your 401K, your retirement. Maybe your marriage is falling apart. Your home is coming apart. You don't see any hope. Well, I don't have the answers for all of your problems, but the Lord Jesus Christ does. He certainly has the answers to your problems if you'll just turn to Him. Just open up your heart, just say, "God, I've messed up. "I'm in the middle of this storm "and I don't know where to go or what to do." I'm not saying the storm passes over. But He'll take you through it. The boat was sinking. And all of a sudden, they remembered Jesus is in the boat. And so they go to Him, they wake Him up. "Lord, don't you care that we're about to perish? "Aren't you concerned about this?" And Jesus quietly rebukes them. "O you of little faith." And He rebukes the wind, and He rebukes the waves, and it became instantly still. And they said to one another, "What kind of man is this? "Even the wind and the waves "obey His voice?" The disciples in the middle of this storm, they cry out to Jesus to save them. And that's a prayer, "God save me. "Jesus save me." Maybe that's your prayer right now. "Save me from the storm that I'm in." When these storms come if we put our faith and trust in Christ, if He is the Shepherd of our life, we don't have to be afraid of these storms. [Billy Graham preaching] Don't let the headlines frighten you! Yes, we're living in a crisis period, but God is with us in the midst of the grief. In the midst of the suffering, God is there. O God, we don't understand it all but we believe you're the great and the mighty God. God, I believe, I trust in You, even if I don't understand. God still loves. And He loves with such an everlasting love that He gave His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die for you. And if it were not for that, there is no hope in the world. And those of us that follow Him and serve Him have a future that's brighter than tomorrow! It is our glorious task to give hope through the message of the cross and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ Who came to bring peace in a broken world. No matter what God has in store for us and for our world, let us be found faithful. And someday we will know all the strife and the injustice and the pain that infect our world today is someday going to be over. Hallelujah! [echoing] Hallelujah... hallelujah... [Graham] During this time of the coronavirus, there's so much uncertainty and people are scared. And they're looking and searching for answers and hope. There was a politician not long ago said that "With every crisis comes opportunity." And of course he was talking about political opportunity. But I thought about that. Wow, this crisis has given us a tremendous opportunity for evangelism. People are scared. In the community, wherever you are, wherever you live, there are people that are afraid. And to be able, as a Christian, to walk by them and encourage them. What an opportunity to pray. To pray for the lost, to pray for your neighbor who doesn't know Christ. Pray for the person who lives across the street. There's things that we can do and I would want to encourage you let's find how we can be active with our neighbors and friends and family. And you may be the only one who can make a difference in that person's life. God may be using you to share the hope that we have in Jesus Christ. With the Billy Graham Association, I'm not able to do crusades right now. Those meetings, we had to postpone them or cancel them, so what are we gonna do? A man called me a few weeks ago, said, "Franklin, how 'bout putting an ad on television? "Just telling people how to put their faith in Christ?" We put that together in a hotel room, and had it on TV within a few days. ...fear that millions of others have because of this coronavirus pandemic. But I want you to know that God loves you, He made you, He created you. He knows everything about your life. You don't need to be afraid. Jesus said, "I'll never leave you nor forsake you." If you've never invited Jesus Christ into your heart... We've got a phone center that's up and running and people can call 24/7. We've got hundreds of people who can answer the phone and take a phone call and pray with a person, answer the spiritual questions. [Woman] Thank you for calling the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. How may I pray for you? [Edwards] Right now people are at home. People are scared. People are watching the news. And how incredible is it that they, all of a sudden, while they're watching news about doom and gloom, all of a sudden Franklin Graham comes on and says, "Here's a message of hope. Give us a call. "We want to pray with you." Dear Father God, thank You for Lois and for her call... And Lord, I just ask You to return the joy of her salvation to her. [Edwards] We've got over 600, going on 700 volunteers. Got seventy, so we're bumping it up. We can kind of cover these prime times. We want to share the gospel with as many people, and we want to do it as well as we possibly can. We want to answer every call. That's a challenge. It's a hard challenge but we're excited for that opportunity. [Man] People are calling for prayer for a variety of needs. When they receive the Lord for the first time, uhm, we have a little bell over here that we ring and announce it to everyone in the room and then everybody claps because we know that the heavens are rejoicing as well. [Davis] One of the phone calls that I got was from a gentleman who's in a nursing facility, worried about the coronavirus. When I asked him where he would go if he died today, would he go to heaven? He said, "I don't know." So I was able to go through the plan of salvation with him and he said, "I want to pray that. I want to do that." And I said, "I'm gonna lead you through all that." I lift him up to You, Father, and I pray that You would bless him. I've heard our bell ring here more in these last couple weeks than we have since, when Billy Graham actually passed away. We're going to do what we can to try to encourage people. If we don't share the hope that we have in Jesus Christ, who's gonna share that with them? People from other countries around the world are searching, searching for God, searching for answers, and we've built special landing pages in six different languages where people right now in another country can go to that landing page and get the answers that they're looking for. I want the world to know that God loves them and that Jesus Christ is there for them now. [Martin] As the coronavirus problem began in China and was exploding, we realized that we had an opportunity through the Mandarin Chinese ministry to build a landing page and begin to advertise to it so people could find hope in Christ in the midst of this crisis. And then we were able to take that into the other languages that we do ministry in because the problem was moving around the world. We have trained volunteers all over the place who are online, offering hope, personally engaging and interacting with our visitors. All right, just making sure you guys can hear me. Can you see me okay? Adjust that, how's that? How's that look? Do I have it where you need me? Being a chat coach in internet evangelism, we go on the internet and we speak to people who come on who either have questions about Jesus Christ or just come on to want to pray. What we're going through right now with the pandemic there's a lot of fear and anxiety and we strongly believe that our ministry has been placed just at the forefront in this time when there's a lot of fear; when there's really not that many options. Being from Canada, I talk with people from like, Fiji, from Ghana, from South Africa, from Australia, from New Zealand. No matter where you are in the world, people have the same struggles, the same questions. And the answer is always the same-- Jesus. [Martin] In these first weeks, over a hundred thousand people have come to our landing pages. Over 10,000 have indicated decisions for Christ. Our volunteers are busy and excited to reach people. It's the most important thing that I do in my life, when you know that you made a difference by the Lord using you. When I realized I've helped someone recognize who they are in Christ and how much He loves them, that brings me great joy. [Graham] During this time of the coronavirus, churches are closed and Christians are scattered in many ways. But there's also something else that's taking place. We have chaplains deployed to the Samaritan's Purse field hospitals in Italy and also up in New York, dealing with the raw emotion of people struggling with death and sickness. And there, right in the middle of it, we have opportunity to pray with people and have people turn their lives to Jesus Christ. It was in the news yesterday that just touched my heart, was a person was saying that their loved one had passed away and they died alone because we could not come into the hospital to be with them. And I thought to myself, if someone passed away, they will not die alone. Our chaplains will be there to pray for them, to pray with the families. This deployment is different than any that I have ever been on because it's dealing with an infectious disease that is deadly. I was asked, "Why would you even go to New York "in a time like this?" [Denmark] I'm from New York. My husband and I here are deployed to help our city. In 9/11 it was very quiet and very fearful. This is a little bit different. There's a different type of a fear. [Denmark] Jesus never shied away from the storm that came. We as Christians shouldn't shy away from these storms. [speaking Spanish] The COVID's been hopping from country to country. [Cole] It really hits you to think, there is no behind the lines around the whole world. It's incredible. [Schaafsma] My neighbor passed away just the other day. I feel like the enemy's right on the street. I currently live in Milan and we're all under lockdown in our homes. When the call came to come down here and be an interface with Samaritan's Purse I was more than happy to come. Who else can you live for but for Jesus? Jesus' words in John 16, "Be of peace for I have overcome the world." He's definitely changed my life. [Denmark] It's important for me to be here to be Christ's hands and feet extended. I've been able to speak to many people. They're so thankful, so grateful that we're here. [Clark] The neighbors are curious. Curiosity on the street is magnificent, want to know what it is and what's going on, and we've been able to share with them that Jesus brings a peace to us that we can't explain. [Denmark] My prayer and my hope is that many would come to know Him as personal Savior. [Man] The possibilities of what God can do through this is mighty. [Graham] I want you to know, God loves you. You may forget everything else I've said on this program, but remember this-- God loves you. But we have a problem. And that problem is sin. You see, our sins separate us from God. God made us, He created us, He loves us, but the Bible says we've all sinned. We've all come short of God's standard, His glory. The Bible says that, "The wages of sin is death." That's the penalty, is death. So the entire human race is under a death sentence. But yet, "God so loved the world, "that He gave His only begotten Son, "that whosoever believeth in Him, "should not perish "but should have everlasting life." God sent His Son Jesus Christ to take our sins. And He took our sins to the cross. And the cross was what the Romans used for execution. And it's the most horrible, cruel death that a person could imagine. And sometimes it took days for a person to die on the cross. And Jesus went willingly to that cross. And while He was there, God poured out on His Son the sins past, the sins present, the sins future, that's us. He poured on His Son the sins of mankind. Jesus became so ugly and so dirty that God turned His back on His Son. And Jesus said, "My God, My God, why has Thou abandoned Me?" That's how serious it was. Many people think that the good things they've done in their life counts. The Bible says it's by grace that we're saved, through faith. "It's not of works, lest any man should boast." It's not your works that saves you. Just because we are religious doesn't mean that we're saved. It doesn't mean we're forgiven. I grew up in a Christian home, had wonderful parents. My father was an evangelist. My mother, not only a homemaker, but she grew up in a missionary family to China. That couldn't save me. My parents could not save me. They loved me, they prayed for me, they cared about me, but they could not save me from my sins. I know that there was a, like a black hole in my life. Everything I tried didn't fill it. I mean, you could have fun, but there was an emptiness. I couldn't describe it, just an emptiness. I remember a few years ago there was a rock star committed suicide and he left a note beside his body and he talked about a great, big, black, empty hole that had opened up in his life. And drugs didn't fill it, sex didn't fill it, fame didn't fill it. And that emptiness-- and he took his life. There was a void, a vacuum. And that void and that vacuum, if you say, "Well, Franklin, that's me." Well, that void and vacuum was created by God and it's to be filled by Him. And if we don't have that relationship with God, then that emptiness is there. But when we come to God and put our faith and trust in His Son Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit of God comes into our heart and fills that vacuum, fills that void. And that's what I did when I was twenty-two, I prayed this prayer. God, I'm a sinner. I'm sorry, forgive me of my sins. I believe Jesus is Your Son. I believe that He died for my sins. I believe You raised Him to life and I want Him to come into my heart and take control of my life right now. I prayed that, I was twenty-two. I didn't know much more. I just prayed that prayer. I remember that night I went to bed, but when I went to bed that night I sensed that there was something different now in my life. I woke up the next morning... oh, I had a headache. I had some issues, but I knew something was different, because when I prayed that prayer, I meant it, I gave Him my life, and He took control of my life at that moment. I've been through many storms, but He's never left me. Not one time. All of us are going to have to face death at some point. Whether it's the coronavirus or cancer or a car wreck or just old age, it's coming. And it's coming for all of us. And the point is, where are we going to spend eternity? Are we going to be in heaven with God, or are we going to be separated from Him? But you have to make that choice. Jesus Christ came to save us from our sins, but you have to accept it by faith. Jesus said, "I'm the way, the truth, and the life." He said, "No man comes unto the Father but by Me." And how could He say something like that? How could He say, "I'm the way, I'm the truth, and I'm the life"? And "no man," no person, no individual "comes to the Father God except through Me." And the reason He could say that is because He is the only one in history to take the sins of mankind. Only Jesus Christ, and He took our sins to the grave. And on the third day, God raised His Son to life. Jesus is not dead. He's alive and He'll come into your heart. He'll come into your life if you'll invite Him. Today God wants to forgive sin. He's eager to forgive sin, but we've got to be willing to repent. And repentance means we turn from that sin. Jesus Christ came to save us. He came on a rescue mission. He didn't come to condemn the world; He came to save the world. I want to ask you a question: Who's the Lord of your life? Have you found yourself now in this storm, in a mess? If you're trying to do this yourself, you're gonna fail. Only God can do this. If you've never invited Jesus Christ into your heart, you can do that right now. That's right, right this second. And what I want to do is just pray a prayer with you. I want to lead you in that prayer. Just repeat this prayer in your heart, after me. Just say, "Dear God, I'm a sinner. "Forgive me of my sins. "I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. "I believe that He died for my sins, "that You raised Him to life. "And I'd like to invite Him "to come into my heart "to take control of my life "from this moment forward, forever. "And I pray this in Jesus' name. "Amen."
