Ken, let's go? -Did they tell you? -Yes. -Come on, I'm going. -We don't have time! Is everyone equipped with sound? -What did you decide? -That, we change it with that. -Okay. -That way, it makes sense. -Do you remind me? -Sure. -Where is Doums? -I don't know. Fuck! -Doums! -Yes! Hey, great! We're up in five minutes, we have to hurry. -You have my mic? -Let's go. Let's go! I tell you all the time! Fuck! Is everyone following? -Yes. -How long do we have? Three and a half minutes. Okay, thanks. Three minutes. We're in the elevator. We're leaving. Yeah, I hear you. Two and a half minutes. Hey, guys, let's go! Don't forget the change. Here we go! Today, I played in front of 80 000 people and I've never felt so alone. MYTILENE, GREECE I'm going out for a while. Again? I'll be back. Sometimes you have to run away from the frenzy of the big cities to realize how much we get used to that daily madness. Paleokipos, my grandfather's village, in Greece. It's said that it's the birth place of Barbarossa. Here, in Mytilini, I'm far from the pressure, I see my family, I take my time. Yet, me, the Parisian, I've never lived there. But my father calls it "the mythical country", the one who sticks to their shoes, where you are in exile. And it's in exile that I speak the best of my life in Paris, in the shadow of distance. You're okay? You hear me? Yeah, I'm good. Where are you? -I'm in Greece. -What are you doing there? I've come to see my grandmother and work a little. I couldn't go to Paris to work. To be honest. -When do you come back? -In a few days. But I'll let you know. There, bro, everybody is calling me. Everybody... -Everyone is asking me: "Where is he?" -Yeah, I know. "Do you have any news? Is he replying?" I'm neither your manager, neither your secretary. Yeah, I know, brother. But I don't know what's happening, I can't... -I couldn't work. -Come on, we lock ourselves in the studio. -Yeah. -...and we try to work, right? Yeah. When I come home, I have to settle two, three things with the label, I'll recruit others and after that... After that, straight to the studio. I'm waiting for that, man. I'm waiting for that. It's been over a year that I was supposed to record my third album. The whole team was counting on me. But I couldn't get used to it... So I did what I do best: to run away... The most difficult part of creating a new work, is the first line. The one who disturbs the balance of a blank page. The one who, by choosing to be, assassinates an infinity of other realities. CHAPTER I PREMIER PAS I want to live abroad All my life, I moved I lived in the suburbs I lived in Paris I've thrown away my phone So I don't get bothered So don't come to question me Send your requests by e-mail I think you're not listening When things are not right, I eat like crazy And lately, I gained a lot of weight It's depressing when you're a pacifist It's been a while since I'm not up to date with the news I hated success, but must believe that it was not enough And if I was 100% myself I wouldn't even do this movie I've been on the road for more than ten years now. Sleeping carelessly, not thinking about the next day. I have so many concerts that my private life has become an intermission. And I ended up alone. I can't stay inactive for more than a day or two. Because it's the moment that chooses when the dark thoughts infiltrate my mind. Sometimes I let some in, slowly. Just to dissect them. Check if I can look them in the face and use them in my work. But I don't let it go for too long because if we're forced to contemplate the dark, we end up getting lost. I don't know if I'm fleeing Paris or if I need to run away from my artist routine when it becomes too heavy. Plus, being almost a... public personality... I became almost a stranger in my own city. In fact, since it's been too long since I've released anything, I've put a stupid pressure on myself. So, I have to come back with an album. Not just a song, not a thing... Well, man, I'm telling you, you can do whatever you want. Lately, my life, it's managing a box, managing good times, managing a breakdown... It's shit. Anyway, a breakdown, again, it can inspire you, but... -Yeah, but it's... -I'm aiming for something bigger. That's why I want to move. Greece made me feel good. We must continue to travel, to see other places. It's what I'm gonna do, if we stay in Paris, we'll be depressed. Sure. This is the first time in my life that I'm in front of a blank sheet. -I tell myself... -Oh yeah? -Yeah. -But that's everyday life to me! Come on! Come to my school, you'll see! -I don't want to. -We'll give you an A! -I don't want to! -No, but I understand, but don't overthink it, man. It'll pass. It's true, you'll see... Because in the end, in rap, we have to release our emotions, we must release what we feel. That's the lease. It's super shameless, brother. -But it's a therapy. -Yeah. Because when I tell personal stuff, I take it back and I put it in my shelf, you see. It becomes an object that I put away, that's no longer there, trying to ruin my day. -It doesn't exist anymore. -It does... -You've materialized and frozen it. -Yeah. It's pretty selfish. -But it's not selfish... -It's therapy. -But what is generous... -You offer it to others. That's it, everyone can... My goal is that even if I speak... For example, I have a broken heart, I want to find what is universal in there, you see? And often, the most universal, it's super-precise and personal stuff. Today, I cried in my brother's arms. It happened like that, without warning. Between two innocuous jokes that we said to fill the void. First, he cried. Suddenly. Silently. It sounded like a sigh of an old football ball if we step on it. Maybe, today, the void was too big. Who knows? The day was like so many others. It was even beautiful. And it's not his kind of whine. Specially because he met others today, a lot more troubled, no doubt. But, well, he cried. And I cried because I saw him crying. It was like a dam that gave way in him. A magma of distorted feelings from being repressed which was breaking on me. A fucking wave of burning vomit that paralyzes your throat, and relieve you when you finally spit it out. Today, I cried in my brother's arms. And it was better than laughing. ALBUM: DAY 1 Elite, do you have a lighter? That can be very hot with the arrangements. The thing you did, it may well finish the loop. I think, the chorus, I'll improvise it. Because... It was hot, the thing you whispered. Yeah. In college, I was hideous But determined like a gangsta I used to steal PlayStations, I'd resell them and buy myself games In college, I was hideous But determined like a gangsta I used to steal PlayStations, I'd resell them and buy myself games What do youngsters know? I used to roam the whole of Paris I'd give myself a spiky hairdo with gel I had the hairstyle of Reese -That's the shit! -That's hot. That's the shit! In college, I was hideous But determined like a gangsta I used to steal PlayStations, I'd resell them and buy myself games What do youngsters know? I used to roam the whole of Paris I'd give myself a spiky hairdo with gel I had the hairstyle of Reese It's not that much like Feu and company, you see? You didn't want to change the stuff? It stays the same color. After you've won, she's okay, you know. -That's the one, it's the banger. -I know. -Don't say that shit. -You know him... You know, anyway... -It's his comfort in there. -Do you like... fast food? -You always go back! -Yeah... Actually, it's easy for me. -To only create sounds where I get... -Yeah. -You know. -This is what you want? No, this is not what I want. It's too easy. To entice things, start with one sound, then... In the middle, change the mood with orchestral delirium or stuff like that, I'd love that. We need people who excel at what they do and kind of bring them to our world, you see? To have other musical styles. I felt that there were too many things who kept us in Paris and that were preventing us from dedicating truly to it. Suddenly, we were stuck. There was a country which I had been thinking for a while. So, I got tickets for everyone, I rented a house and we left. CHAPTER II TAKOTSUBO I took some guys who have talent and I like everything that they do. I asked them to work together. Everyone has their specialty, that's what is cool. Lo is in his own world, has the madness that few people have. You have Diabi, who oversees everything. Hugz, whatever happens, is going to bang. Loubenski and Selman are training musicians. I knew they were the dream team. -That one? -No. Victory! Ah, that's good! Calm down, Diabi! Calm down! It's not the time to clap! Calm down. Calm down! I'm changing. What do you want to do? You want... This will be the door to enter my studio. This one is coming out. Basically, I wanted to do it here, but it's too noisy. Yeah, it's a little bad. Actually, it's small, but you know, I can really fill it with... You know, futons, pillows... So, when you do it there, it'll absorb the sound. That's good, Diabi. Yeah. Like that, yeah... -But you have to fill it better. -I will. I'm actually gonna do that. Bring me the futon. That's okay? Yeah. Okay, that's staying, it absorbs. But it absorbs a little. If I cover it all, it'll absorb fully. If you put the bar here, it'll hold it. In any case, we'll have to remove the door. In any case? There, that does it. There's a peculiarity, but I like it. -You like it? -It's cool. Travel light, come back heavily loaded My girlfriend is heavily loaded My team is doubling Charo She rolled the joints heavily loaded The keufs have heavily loaded us The flashball is heavily loaded My hotel charged me heavily It's my turn to take care of it Kilos of hashish in the Jeep And at the graveyard of dreams Lie our jackal's hopes No more storage in the RAM Stories on bandages A kind of morbid boredom Which makes you hope for a drama And then this desire will disappear With the first missing When I realized I was a coward Of those who romanticize the street A mic in his wallet is shining An ill-mannered brought it to us My brother told me: "Look at the price!" Not a dime, but we took it At least we will have tried That's it, here's the future Try to prove that you're real Becoming it by stopping to try A little coffee and we're going. I have to go there. After that, you'll just use... Ah! You see? Ah! But like the last chord, it doesn't arrive on the fifth, it must shift to... You see? Gentlemen. -We're hammering on Head. -Ah... -It's not good? -I like it, but nothing more. Get up, brother. There's football! Even I will play! Ouch, it cracked! I swear, this piece, it's useless to do too much... too much... Actual changes, because, really... Yes, but at the base, it sounds a little, like light. -It sounds light. -Doesn't need edits. -Agreed. -It sounds light, but you get lost by doing that stuff. We don't get lost! We make music, we don't make yogurt. We have to try 15 000 things to come up with something we like. Generally, good ideas come from bullshit. It's certain. In my life, I'm just a spectator You're falsely right and falsely wrong. But I like it. They don't want me to slip away I need to be alone To be condemned to that. I feel adrift these days We say the infinite universe They're not the same chords, are they? -I know they're not. -You're crazy! -It's them! -How do I sing after that? Space. I don't want to put it back. -What do you want to do? -I dunno. -Take a break. -Go ahead, take a break. I can't do it anymore. In the end, I didn't do anything. Sometimes I wonder if I really exit In my life, I'm just a spectator Then I hurt myself, but discreetly The psychiatrist told me: "It's just one aspect of your fear" And when I hurt, I feel like living a little It's dark when the lights come out We almost forget that we are sad They don't see that I'm in the moon They don't want me to slip away I need to be alone The lights of the city dribble On the stage You were the only one But your eyes are black The ink replaced the sap I don't need you I feel adrift these days We say the infinite universe It's also said that it extends So where does it extend to? I don't have my feet on the ground I need space I'm afraid of your hidden face I don't have my feet on the ground The elements composing the universe: galaxies, the heaps of dust, the stars, move away from each other, inexorably. A little like us. When two stars are too close and then one of them explodes, she condemns the other stars to wander astray in the universe. We call them "Wandering Stars." insomnia is her curse Her eyes on a screen Until she becomes bleary-eyed I look out of the window The moon is green Viewing it from the confluence I never wanted to get used to it She’s everywhere You make me defy all the laws of sleep Coming back to me at night to the point Of dislodging the planks of the bed base The noise of dead leaves Scratch the pavement My reflection in this puddle In which I can no longer see myself It reminds me very much of you Needs structure. -Cool. -It'll be cool. Eleven o'clock. In Tokyo. I'm alone. It's another energy that I perceive. Is that why I love this city so much? Or is it because here I'm nobody? Hello, Ken? It's Tiga. Are you in Tokyo? Tomorrow I'll be with some friends. Come join us! Small, I was in a world apart, populated by monsters, unexplored lands, flamboyant samurais. I gave shapes to the shadows. I interpreted the breath of the wind in the trees like imaginary melodies. I turned on myself, head in the air until the buildings are overturned and the clouds are falling. I was convinced that everyone had this fantastic vision of what surrounds us. Growing up, I realized that no, that most accepted a cold interpretation of reality and they were waiting for me to come back in this narrow mold, leaving me to miss a part of me. It was only through art that I could express my distortion of reality, and make it a strength. Escaped from a Tim Burton film I'm in my delirium Is there death for man? I'm just running away May God forgive me The love for my team That my team gives me back And the full moon Turned this man into wolf Tomorrow, I'll have changed mood at dawn You thought you saw a simple handshake But the bag in the hand Passed from one hand to another That the concrete in the panorama Paris will always have many dead rats Traffic restrains of the Panamera We'll erase the evidence Yeah, but not our remorse And the coward is out, the fellow is rare You were so proud of the mercy stroke And now, you're less proud You're not afraid of hell But the head upside down, you have like a taste of dirt And before God I try to do my best I don't feel so good I don't want to show anything In front of them The sequences of the pieces, I begin to see where they're going. I was lost at first, there was too much work. We have to finish at least 15 songs before... -Yeah. -At least 15... Frankly, if you want to do that, it's possible, huh, but you have to be here every day and sleep here. -No more trips to the countryside? -No more trips, leaving to go to the restaurant and coming back the next day at 5h30 pm... It never happened to me. Okay. Anyway, that's what I planned. I have the impression... We're going too much... Actually, we're going too much into the performance and not much into the effectiveness. That's what I thought too. That's the thing that really hit me yesterday. We don't have a pretentious album yet, but I'm afraid we will. Frankly, we can do 15 titles in ten days. You know it. But, for that, you have to be here. We already did, but you must be here. No, but don't worry, go ahead, it's good. We go into mode... Even if we don't have 15 songs, if we made ten songs, man, it will be huge already. Otherwise, in fact, after, we will be rushing so much that it will jeopardize a lot of things. Well, let's go get refreshed. I'll be coming back inspired from the mountains. I'll go see some great wise men. There is something in the way The wind blows There's a few more pixels in the sky As if in my life before, I was absent I feel it There's something In the shadows buried in the hollows There is something in dreams By searching the essentials As if in my life before, I was absent I feel it I feel it Excuse me. Do you know where Aooni temple is? What is that? Don't worry, it's nothing. You're looking for the temple? You have to go up there. I can take you. Is it far? We have to climb a little more. In my family, we are farmers for generations. We've only ever worked in the fields. There's no one here anymore. Everybody's gone. God left the mountain. This country is deteriorating more and more. It's money that counts. Everyone just talks about the money... What is that? This is my crew. My team. Do you like it? It's been a long time I've seen a young person like you. Nice team. Do you want to see? Nice. I put them like that. Stylish. In the past, everyone considered nature a goddess. They prayed to her. But now it's money. What will become of this world? I like everything that floats. All that evaporates. The movements that we see from the corner of the eye. It's too much to stare at. Fragile ideas, which one would kill to have. Diffuse feelings, which only appear when you lose them. The ethereal. When the writer probes human thoughts to seize the body, he is looking to dispel the permanent fog in which the spirits are ignored. Yet this vagueness of daily life dresses too, in its way, human feelings. Sometimes it's better to live without understanding everything. ARRIVAL OF S-CREW Life is a whore You're stupid if you think she loves you After shooting you in the legs, she shoots in the head Yeah! How are you, man? Yeah! How are you, guys? -The trip went well? -Yeah! Yeah! It's good, uh? -Did you see what they brought? -A month since they're there! There were no dogs? You know here it's straight to prison. Ouch! Here, the prison, it's not like in the series. Prison Break? In prison, they force you to get up at 6 am. You don't get up, you're fucked. You're gonna work. 12 hours of work. What are you going to do? -I can sleep. -You don't do it. -I sleep. -You can't. They put you in misery until you're formatted. -It's crazy. -It's the army. They force you to be a better man. Can you imagine Doums there? He'd go crazy! I'm so happy. I'm about to cycle in Japan. -We'll have to go rent it. -Damn! Having my guys closer in the country we dreamed of when we were kids, it made me a... I found the love of when rapping in the room of Mekra with his grandmother who would send us out if we played too loud. I loved that. You've recorded songs since you got there? At first, I was depressed, I couldn't record. I started to... I don't know, brother... Actually, I was like that in Paris already. It was cool here to tell me: "I'm not going out, I'm still locked up" now that we're here. Yeah. It's not that I had no inspiration, but I didn't know... I have too many texts and I don't know how to organize them. -That's okay. -They were full of prods. So, I didn't know where to turn to. I was going around in circles. So yeah, Loub. You can find us... "A purple peanut"? Okay, I'm going right now! For my team, I would do anything. Session number one. We don't need to listen to it. -Yes. -Exactly, yes. You see that? Yeah. Ah, yes! Do you understand that? That's it, huh. -Because, just ... -He'll explain that to you. As we said, it would be nice if there was one or more themes coming back in the "bumal". -Yeah. -The most identifiable, that's it. Okay. That's hot. -Make several variations. -From this theme. It's the same thing, and tell it every time in a different way. -That's hot. -And with that... There's a great minor chord. Yeah, we can also make it major. -We can. -Yeah. It will be much sadder. Movie stuff, that's it. You have a theme with an accompaniment. The chords from the beginning. You're so cool! Nickel, thanks. Thank you very much! Come on, we'll work out a plan. Diabi, I find you too... -I find you careless. -You do? On the organization. Yes. -Well, tell me. -Too sad. -Too sad? -Yeah. Like you let me ramble, actually. Are you crazy or what? I have to say, "We finish this piece." But already, you had to come this morning. -Well, I didn't have any... -Sorry? -I didn't have any... -Do you want to do like F? Do we look at the messages? I'm guilty. -There it is, thanks! -I'm guilty. -Well, there, then. -I woke up at 2 pm. I'll not rush it because I'm too insolent. When I'm insolent, it has to be hot, the phases have to be hot. All the relationships I have give me some inspiration. Besides, many more than me, actually... In fact. If you look, in my stuff, I speak of myself, but through others, in fact. Because my life is not very interesting. I'm right there in speaker mode, in real life. You know what I mean? Ah, he got it, the bastard! -More like... -We have to play in a loop. Selman! Just the... The cello guy plays very well. -That's what I thought. -He plays well. -He must think... -A soft sound. A sweet sound, you see? Like a brioche. Let's go! -They'll stop in ten minutes. -Huh? They'll stop in ten minutes. -They'll stop in ten minutes? -Yeah. Ten guys, huh. -One more. -One more? I'll explain it to you. -We have five minutes. Can we... -Ten. Ten? Okay. There is still the theme. -The theme is not the priority. -Okay. -That's the priority. -Okay. We are doing both now. Let's go. -As you wish. -Don't worry. -We do that and the theme. -Go ahead. Playlist. It's noon and they have to leave, but they can stay another 15 minutes and they are okay to stay if you do what you have to do in 15 minutes. -They're the best. -It will be done. -Thank you. -I love you. Go ahead, Diabi, you tell me. I need a little more compression in the voice. That's what I'm doing here. I went there anyway. They will stop me no more. In the arms of another girl I envy the love I have and I'm drowning It's going too fast, like death For a young black It starts at daycare, this terrible gap It's going very fast like the coming From the cops in rich neighborhoods Growing up with gold in bar, Inherited from your family And the grids of private schools Become your ramparts So, yeah, we can all get out, that's right But we still have to do A lot more effort there There, you know what they will tell you If you ever talk to them about it? "Don't worry, go, When there is a number at stake We get strong in math" The news will hurt They scream at the TV Still a seed full of beauty That the street buries You wanted to tear off the pain Become insensitive But you still have in your heart a bit Of goodness you thought you'd lost We must not atrophy Catastrophic balance Because often everything goes too fast Except the suffering -You killed me there. -Sorry! You want to kill me, Diabi Dia-bye Diabolo-bolo, yes They talk about democracy But nobody believes it True anti-racists bother LICRA States fill our rivers with nitrates I'm waiting for love like Jenifer in 2003 They talk about democracy But nobody believes it True anti-racists bother LICRA I'm waiting for love like Jenifer -Shut up. -Shut up. Perfect. It's perfect like that. -Shut up! -Shut up! No! You have sushi, sashimi. I'm not hungry. Check the arrangements of "Menteur, Menteur". Have you done it yet? - Estou farto. - Diabi, louder! They're not square Like Jim in "Liar, liar" They're not square like Jim In "Liar, liar" Give them ten opportunities They choose slow, slow First counter-attack, I score I score like Landers, Landers I have Hisoka's smile in Hunter x Hunter They're not square like Jim In "Liar, liar" Give them ten opportunities They choose slow, slow Baby, I'm in the bus, bus In the subway, subway I have Hisoka's smile in Hunter x Hunter I see Paris from above Like Hauts-de-Seine "Ken" for the first name "Feu" for the stage name Double demon like the Olsens Smoke comes out of me like onsen I dreamed that you spoke badly It was strange like hell I had been told that you spoke badly But you're sweet as a Lu Secret side like the moon Nobody walks on me like the moon Yeah! Don't tell your life I will break your heart like a Lu, yeah Take care of your sins F.T.G B.T, yeah If you're homophobic It's because you judge Force my LGBT And I was really annoyed, yeah I rub shoulders with top models There is R But in front of her, I bugged In front of her, I bugged She's creamy like Nivea Easy as level one When it's over, she erases her coms It's easy like the phases in "like" Softly Okay, you're sweet, but gently It's been less than two weeks We know each other Better do it gently in this world You took me for a drink You will not make me believe That it's wine Yeah, you're stone like Silver The strike comes from The Rif as Sylvain As soon as we came back from Japan, it had been so intense and rich in emotions, that Diabi and I, we didn't call each other. We gave each other time to settle our affairs and all the responsibilities we left during the two months we had spent. And by taking a step back, I realized that... I didn't even have a third of the album and that even if it inspires me, and I had found the right formula, we had to go back. CHAPTER III VOYAGE LÉGER This time, I told Diabi: "Come on, we'll stand in the sun." LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, USA It's part of the arrangement. Right, fuck it. Right, I wanted to make a point about what we have done and not done. So, really finished, we have "Menteur-Menteur". Even "Menteur-Menteur", there are things I would like to change. The moods to the chorus... Remove them, rather. It's tweaking. -Yeah, tweaking. -It's not good. -Nothing to leave there. -If it is to be fine-tuned, it's almost finished. After, it's retouching. What else? Well, there is... The one we just did. "Y a Pire"? We'll recheck that. The harmonies on the chorus too. We only have that? -How many titles? -Ten. Ten. Finished, yeah. -That's great. -Just have them chained. I was nothing I will always represent my people My people For them, I was everything When I was nothing I was nothing I will always represent my people What a surprise. Since earlier, did you film that? A bunk bed? I didn't really realize. It makes me feel bad, but I don't know if it's hot. You make me listen because it's useless if I don't like it, and you'll have worked for nothing. Like yesterday, you spent two hours on it. Yeah, but like that, you listen well. Listen to the catch, I can listen. I don't really like it. I'll do it again. What don't you really like? I don't know. I swear, I don't know. -I did that on each piece? -It was only two. I will always represent my people Ah, the voice, it's nice! My people It's good to work with pros. How long did I stay? I was everything when I was nothing -15 minutes ? -I had time to go to Insta, like things and do everything. For them, I was everything When I was nothing I like that. I will always represent my people My people For them, I was everything... -No! You're crazy! -Fuck! The end, shut up! Until the end! That's how you do it! You neglect things! What do I neglect? You will listen to the end! I will always represent my people Yeah! For them, I was everything When I was nothing I was nothing I will always represent my people -And now, you can do your selection. -Oh fuck... Okay, that's hot! Sometimes there is magic, ideas are linked together. Are you trying to make me understand that we will not record? What? Are you trying to make me understand that we will not record? I'm blown up. You want to record, we record, but I'm dead. We don't really care about what they say In a rap album, collaborations are like a second layer. Once the spine is done, this allows to feed on all artistic encounters and bring freshness. BRUSSELS BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Soon, I'll stop it all, mama Soon, my life will change Difficult to tell Between men, we guess Soon, I'll stop it all, mama Don't worry about my future Soon, my life will change Tomorrow, I'll move from this city -Something like that, you see? -It's stylish. It's big, we say what we want. -You like it? -Yes. I have to work on it. In studio, it'll go well. Here, I'm shy. Our success is for all the mother fuckers Who looked at us badly And when I was little, I admit, sometimes I was jealous Of the kids my mum took care of Those who came to lift the furniture, they were not the movers Separation of households before The child becomes a teen Mouss spent four years in the closet For him, it was big And your rappers What are they talking about? It's rednecks, it's lifeguards -He hears me? -Yeah. -The beginning, it was not bad. -Yeah? -You want to listen? -Calmer. Yeah, it was cool. Want me to try something? -Yeah, cool. -Come on. I wonder if it's vibes. It's not the right note, not the right range. I am in the bendo, shut up Hail not, I'm not courteous Far from thugs and bourgeois Between life and death on the armrest I hear "Dirty Negro", oh yeah? I turn dry, Glock, boom, boom Bang, bang Every day to be in main event Just find the one that was the best. And even there, I don't know if you had to put the one you put in lead. You know, you should do a chorus, a little? In the team, I have known everyone for years. What we did, is that we locked ourselves in Japan, doing what we love, actually. And you saw, like everything... Diabi oversees everyone because there are crazy musicians. And so, that's what... There is an alchemy that is created, it's crazy. -Mama, I was under gasolina -Mama, I was under gasolina But I want to be a solid guy I don't want to see my guys under lean No That worries me Yeah, I love it. It's good not to have all the time in mind what you will do. You're right. You put a little sketch and after, the free space that there is, it's the creation... My texts are always a little... I see colors. So, I stay in that thing. It's stronger than me. I'm really in... You see, like "Feu du bois"... Bah, all songs, in general, I'm in this stuff and... -You're going to get it deep down. -I'm going to the bottom of the thing. Yeah, but you write fast. You can do a billion things... -I write all the time. -Full of crash tests. But I don't like crash tests. I'm crazy, I don't like it when it's not finished. When it's just a little... I have trouble with that. Rap is the music of doing well. You don't need anything. Your voice, a notebook and imagination. And you become the superhero of your street. -We killed it. -Very hot. -Dirty! -I think that... We started rapping on instruments which didn't belong to us. The sample is the art of diversion. Some take it for looting, but it's creation. A Frankenstein monster composed of a patchwork of sample sounds. But when you get famous, the copyright related to the sample complicates everything. The problem is the sample. Yes! This is the most famous group in Guinea. That's not the problem. If they come, they take everything. -They take everything. -Yeah, at worst... -At worst, what? -They take everything. And I give them everything, even 200%. On Jay-Z's album or Isaac Hayes, he has 0% to him and everything goes for Isaac Hayes. It's the same for me. It's Guineans. At worst, they are dead or they will ask me for money, I'll give them. Take everything, even what I'll do next! Take this money, I don't care! I live for music. Even though the use of samples get lost in rap, I wanted to have this hotter color on the album. We decided to audition new musicians to sample them later. Let's go! Go ahead, next! He has gone mad! Hey, talk to people, brother! Sorry, brother. He's crazy, this guy. Cool! Thank you. It's cool. We go on? Okay, thank you! -We'll think of someone else. -It was a pleasure. -It's not won, huh. -No. CHAPTER IV CIEL NOIR So this time, we had to go back to the source. NEW ORLEANS NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA How are you? Hi, brother. -Hi, brother. -What's up? -You're okay? -Yeah. You're good? Cool? This is hot! I'm not trying to hide myself behind metaphors. But you have to go around some truths to touch them better. A real suffering is precious. It's like a treasure. It is protected from intrusive looks. We admire it in secret, possessive and shameful. And we are proud to survive. A real suffering is not exposed in the harsh light of the factual explanation. It could be spoiled, desecrated. Make it mundane and unattractive. Make it heal, even. No, a real suffering, it's sublime and it is distilled slowly, at the bend of words. For the dead cats who hang up these snatches of pain to their own suffering. For those who do not listen with the ears. In the universe, there is no sound. Who cares about wandering stars that rattle noiselessly? It's on "state emergency". You lie! When the neighbor came, he said, "You know the hurricane that's going to hit us?" -Yeah. -It's called Nate. -Nate? -Yeah. Ah, it has a blaze? -When they have names... -He has a blaze! Nate will strengthen by getting closer to the American coast. -What? -It will become stronger as it approaches. We're trying to finish an album for the posthumous album... -Are we on Tremé? -Yeah, it's there. They are ready for Halloween since last Christmas. I would like... Do you know what we do? We write and compose at the barracks. Yeah. And after that, we... We take a studio day, or one night, and we record. That's crazy. Right, that's great. But, man... But, man... It's a monster. It's a monster from hell! Well, that's it. -You just got that? -Yeah. Too bad. There it is. Go, there! You didn't expect that, kid? -Run under hurricanes. -What a trap! You're too hot! Hydrate yourself while you run! I think it's there. He's Jeremy. He plays in the street. We had met him the day before on Bourbon St. He was so talented that he was offered to come to the studio. Do we record that? This meeting was pure destiny. Jeremy was playing on the street in Las Vegas, when the killings of October 1, 2017 broke out. He fled and took a ticket to New Orleans. That's where we met him. The main reason for our trip to New Orleans, it was the meeting with a local legend, the Trombone Shorty jazzman. I tell him to go? Thank you. That's hot. I think that was the best one. That was good. We were doing well. Hurricane Nate hit the United States. After crossing the Gulf of Mexico, this category 1 storm swept the Mississippi delta. In New Orleans, the authorities have decided to lift the curfew. The areas near the coast could be affected by the floods. And if cyclones were the sum Of all the last sighs of the Earth? And if the earthquakes were The sum of all our first steps? And if the cyclones were the sum Of all the last sighs of the Earth? And if the earthquakes were The sum of all our first steps? 11 am, New Orleans I'm walking solo In the neighborhoods of Tremé The news comes to announce the hurricane The air is heavy, the sky is black Forbidden to hang out Curfew is scheduled for 7 pm But the people here don't look too worried They say they knew the worst with Katrina And the crimes To know who controls the rain-tee They are partying and offer me to toast Have a good mood in abundance Musicians have fun improvising All the neighbors get supplies Crowded crowd, completely ready Play the trumpet in a storm And the newspaper might have been wrong But I run soaked from head to toe The hurricane has gone a few miles The areas around the port are flooded Far from my lands, sentimental mood It's not just the fear I felt climbing Far from my lands I only thought about my people I only have their memories And their invocations Strange as one feels impulses of love In contact with death or its evocation Europeans forget all too often That they're nothing Faced with the nature That takes back their rights Tornado of thoughts that turn in my head I catch one in flight And I think back to you Okay, let's go, then? -This is what you want, Ken? -Yeah. It's good, right? -Let's go. -Come one, let's go. Writing is the first act Writing is the first act of a man Deprived of his freedom I have the names of prisoners As my witness Engraved on the walls of jails Pure as young love The whispers grow louder No sooner do we live that we die It's the sound of caves going back up And disturbing these fucking residents Had to cheat the system to get away Fuck the subway and its full rates Street word is: "You’re hotheaded" But the saddest part about life Isn’t things happening to you But rather nothing happening at all When one of my people gets tired We take turns And if one of my people falls We get them back up But if one of my people leaves I can’t get over it Although I’m sure we leave behind These grounds to better rise again We’ll be there for his mama One of my people falls We get him back up We’ll be there for his mama We only leave to better rise again Yeah, go ahead... I'm coming. -You hear me ? -Yeah, I hear you. Ideally, we record the choruses. -Yeah. -But there's no time. -Yeah. -I'm afraid they'll leave before the end. Okay. Selman, if you want to go on something else, you choose. It's serious beautiful, it's not bad. Diabi? It's good? You tell me when it's good? Above the clouds, the sun shines Back on earth, the sky is dark A mother buries her dead All in this together, but where do we go? We’re all blind passengers Passerbyes wear masks And devour it all, like a mass That looks like No-Face From Spirited Away Demons congregate Around the body we pick up And the blood look black Under the revolving light They only think about the money So watch me grab them euros I’m at the top and I’ve become a lion Love is an essence, death is birth One day, there won’t be anything left Of these mouths that curse Nothing left of these fading horizons Nothing left of our mothers, Of our sons, of my music Only these spitting volcanoes And no more lightning striking No more flowers nor a grain of salt And no more clouds falling onto us When concrete golems rise up to the sky There will only be trembling stars Falling into these vanishing galaxies No time, no dimension, no meaning The universe will go back To what it was before its birth Dark sky. CHAPTER V COMPTE LES HOMMES After the last studio session with Trombone Shorty and all the singers, there, I knew that... We couldn't push the album further musically speaking. We had gone super far in delirium, we had tested a lot of stuff. I had the number of pieces that I needed, the atmosphere that I needed. I just needed an end. And since the beginning, I wanted add a touch of Greek music, I thought, "I'm going to leave here where I started to think about the album.. MYTILENE, GREECE On my island. I'm going to take Selman with me because he's a Turk and there's a music called "rebetiko." I told him: "I'll introduce you to musicians from the island, I would like you to compose a whole bunch of curls and use it to finish the album." It turns out that my island, Mytilini, is experiencing the biggest migration crisis since the Second World War. Whenever I go to see my family, I witness this catastrophic situation. And just like all the conversations that I have, the people I meet inspire me, indirectly, it's found in my texts. They say we can't make up for all the misery of the world. Give them what was stolen from them. These are my arguments. It's been 25 years that refugees arrive on our island. The locals never had any trouble with those who come because they are people who need help. The problem is not: "Why are people coming?" but: "Why are they fleeing their country?" Some say: "But why don't they stay in their country?" How can you stay in a country where bombs kill your children? Would you stay? I went with a photographer at sea. We found a boat with 15 people in it. When we came in, there were babies. There was also a woman who kept crying. We said: "We are here to save you." She takes out her cell phone and shows me a picture of three children. She had one in her arms. She had boarded the day before, there was a shipwreck, both babies drowned. One of the bodies arrived here, and the other in Turkey. After, we hear: "The problem, it's the refugees who are landing." It's a problem that the woman arrives with a baby and it's not a problem that two babies drowned. Today, I think back and I can't believe it was real. Rebetiko is the music of the outlaws, exiles, vagabonds. In the 1920s, more than a million of refugees from Asia Minor have piled up in the slums of big cities, where they developed this musical current forbidden under dictatorship. Today, refugees come from other countries, but the uprooting sung by the rebetiko is the same. You want to know where I come from Check the BPM FINAL RECORDING FINAL MIX I have to stop complaining There is so much worse in this world Misfortunes, there are plenty I took some blows, but I'm not dead I have to stop complaining Must take a chance, we are men Intransigent with myself And tolerant with others I have to stop complaining There is so much worse in this world Misfortunes, there are plenty I took some blows, but I'm not dead I have to stop complaining At home, everyone eats up When I don’t feel well I strengthen myself Love, it’s nothing, it comes and goes So now, I’m hanging on to the light When the clouds come out And I no longer even regret The many nights we spent together Even if our love was stained With all sorts of somber nuances You looked draped in your pride But you were naked underneath A young man from the Entourage is dead I cried in a synagogue And if our bodies perish We’re only left with love, if not, what? What? In my heart, a few signs still Told me: “Launch into your dreams and bring peace between all the MCs” With us the point of music Is to upset hearts And dreams, it’s like the classics Each to his own Music makes me take off far away But what a strange rocket My girlfriend smiles at me Although she’s been transfused I have to stop complaining There’s much worse in this world Misfortunes, there are a lot I’ve taken some blows, but I’m not dead I have to stop complaining I have to take my chance, we’re men Intransigent with myself And tolerant with others I have to stop complaining There’s much worse in this world Misfortunes, there are a lot I’ve taken some blows but I’m not dead I have to stop complaining At home, everyone eats their fill When I don’t feel well I strengthen myself Love, it’s nothing, it comes and goes The adrenaline on stage is so strong, that one night, at a concert, I broke my hand on a speaker and I felt that the week after, when I saw that it had doubled in volume. It's a metaphor for my life as an artist. Once the exit door is noticed, I was so afraid to return to the galley that I threw myself into this frenetic whirlwind of success, without realizing that I covered the shocks internally. It reminds me of the Looney Tunes cartoons when the character is pursued and continues running in the void before realizing it and falling. In real life, the shock can come years later. When you feel calm, it hits you even more violently. Life is a test. The essential is elsewhere, so, I wandered into other universes. But it was in me that I traveled the most. It's not rap that will save me. But I try to tear off all my calcified feelings to crush them and spread the dust in a work, to blow them on stage. That's how I treated myself on this album. Today, I play in front of 80 000 people and I've never felt so surrounded. Subtitle translation by Claudia Patricia
