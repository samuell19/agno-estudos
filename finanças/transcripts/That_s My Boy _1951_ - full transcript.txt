ANN: Jack, will you hurry, please? Be right down in a minute, hon. Keep those wheat cakes hot. One, two, up and do it. Jack?One, two, up and do it. ANN: Are you hurrying, dear? Another 35, and I'll be right down, hon. One, two... Junior gonna have breakfast with us, Mrs. Jackson? I think so, May. I hope he gets back from the doctor's in time. Not sick again? Nothing serious, just his old trouble, his eyes. With this rainy weather, his sinus has been none too good. Oh, May, we'll have to get rid of those flowers. You know, with Junior's hay fever. Seems to me like that boy's gettin' worse. Not at all. Junior's just had his share of bad luck. After all, he's only a baby. He'll outgrow it. I don't know. I've been in this house for 15 years. He's sure takin' his time. We're not discussing Junior's physical condition. Now, let's check on those wheat cakes. Yes'm. Jack, will you please hurry? Everything's getting cold. Coming, honey. Watch out below! Oh, stop it, Jack! Now, got a big kiss for your husband? As soon as I catch my breath. Breath? That's not the girl I married. Since when does a former Olympic women's swimming champion get out of breath?As of now! I'm ashamed of you. You're getting old. You're not the girl I married.The girl you married wants you to eat your breakfast. The girl I married was the greatest swimmer to ever win in the Olympics. And that was the day that I proposed. Oh, you'll never change. The perennial college boy. Now sit down, and let's forget sports. They belong in the scrapbooks, and we sure have our share of them, all neatly bound. So as we grow older, we can sit before the fire and read them and quietly disintegrate together. I hate to grow old. Well, I must say, you're doing it rather gracefully. I've never seen you looking more attractive. Pretty good shape for a man of 41. Still could get out on that field at Ridgeville U and make those youngsters watch their step. Oh, no, not Ridgeville U and football. They haven't had a team up there in years. The kids today just don't play guts football. Jack, Ridgeville is a small university. You can't expect them to beat a university like Southern California. When you and I went to school and I played quarterback, we beat Southern California. Sit down, dear, and eat your breakfast. What a team we had that year, oh, boy! Bronco Clayton, there was a fullback for you. Ha! And Dusty Henrickson, an end. Dynamite! How do you want your eggs, dear?Big Butch Gorky. There never was a halfback like him. How do you want your eggs? And Pudgy Durgin, lightning fast. We had a team that year, Ann. There'll never be football like that again. BOTH: How do you want your eggs? And in all due modesty, I must say, we'd have never beat USC without "Jarring" Jack Jackson. You know, they don't make you All-American on pull. Didn't get that name "Jarring" Jack for nothing. None of this fancy-pantsy dodgin' like the kids are doing today. You hunched yourself and hit the line hard. You didn't go down because somebody grabbed you, you carried them with you, right? Right. How do you want your eggs? USC thought they had us. Ha-ha-ha! You remember, hon? The score was 6-nothing, one minute to go, 20 yards, and they thought we'd pass.I asked you a question. Let me explain it, so you'll see for yourself. Here was the play. You play Stubby Cochran's position, center. I don't wanna play Stubby Cochran's position! He was a great center, Ann. Almost made All-American. Stay down there. May... Yes, sir.You play end for USC. Excuse me, Mr. Jackson. I can't play end for USC. The wheat cakes will get cold! Well, maybe you're right. Play guard. The play was right off center. That's it. Stay down there, hon. Watch it, May, I'm coming around your end. But Mr. Jackson, what about the wheat cakes? This is ridiculous.Stay down. We only got a minute to go. All right, 44 shift, 33 shift, 22 shift, 21 hike! Hi-- Are you hurt, son?No, sir. Get off the floor. Put your hands up over your head. Take a few deep breaths, come on. That's it, you'll be all right. Jack, stop that. Here, dear, let me help you. Where are your glasses?I don't know, Mother. They must be around here someplace. Oh, well... ANN: Oh, dear! Oh, are you all right, dear? Here, let me help you. There. Oh! I'll be all right. I'll just sit here at the piano for a while. Thanks, Dad. Dad, what were you doing? Oh, nothing, I was-- Your father was reliving his youth. Well, dear, you'd better go upstairs and freshen up for breakfast. All right, Mother. I'll be down in a jiffy. All right. Oh, Mother, Dad, do you notice anything different about me? No, you look the same to me, son. No, what is it? Well, the lower half of the brace is off, and the other half comes off next week. That's wonderful, Junior.I think so. I also have good news from Dr. Hunter. What?He says that the liver shots are working better than he expected, and it'll only be a question of time. Bye. Ann... You know that I love Junior as well as any father ever loved a son. In fact, I've named him Junior after me. But how could this have happened to the two of us? How could what have happened? Let's face facts, Ann. Look at you, look at me, and then look at Junior. Is there nothing to this doggone heredity business? Oh, Jack, he's only a baby. A baby? He's graduating from high school. Yes, but he's just a child. A child? Is that any excuse for him to have hay fever in both winter and summer? To wear glasses since he was 6 years old? To have sinus trouble whether it's rainy or isn't rainy? For heaven's sakes, what's he going to be when he grows up? It's frightening. Jack, there's nothing wrong with Junior physically. Dr. Hunter says it's psychosomatic. Psychosomatic, what's that? Well, his ailments are brought on by mental and emotional disturbances. Well, who's disturbing him? You are. Me? Don't be ridiculous. You know there isn't a better father than I am. I've given that boy everything. When he was 6, I built him a gym out in the garage. When he was 10, I gave him the finest professional football equipment. Oh, no, don't put the blame on me. He's half yours too.Please, Jack, he'll hear you. Well, I don't care if he-- --if he does. Let's eat our breakfast. May. May! ANN: Junior! Hurry, your father's waiting. I'll be right down, Mother. I just have one more nostril to go. ANN: Come on, Junior, everything's ready. I'm-- I'm sorry I'm late, Dad. I used your razor, do you mind? Razor? What for? Well, I'll be-- I'll be shaving soon. In fact, it's starting to come in on my upper lip now, see? Well, that's encouraging. Be careful you don't cut yourself. I'll be careful, but if anything did happen, I always have my Boy Scout first aid kit with me. I'm not an Eagle Scout for nothing, you know. Heh. Have some strawberries, son. Oh, I'll have to pass it up, Dad. Why? Build you up.Well, I-- You know Junior's allergic to strawberries. He breaks out in a rash.Oh, yeah, I forgot. Oh, that's all right, Dad, but I'm taking shots for it. Great. Well, what's next? May! Jack, you don't have to bellow. Mm, boy, those look good. Pass your plate, honey. Thank you. That's it, son. Now, I want you to eat every one of those. Put some syrup on there. Now, dig in, boy. Make a man of you. Dad, I--Oh, you want butter. Sure. Mm, that a boy. Dad, I can't eat these.Why not, boy? Jack, you just go on and eat and let Junior alone. Why can't you eat it, son? Well, Dad, I have too much sugar content in my system now, which Dr. Hunter says could ultimately lead to diabetes when I get older, and I'm taking shots for it. Shots? Right. Say, these wheat cakes are pretty good. By the way, where are the eggs? May! You want them with the ham and the bacon? Leave off the bacon. I want to lose some weight. Just the ham and eggs.Yes, sir. What's the matter with you, boy? I'm waiting for my egg, sir. An egg? What kind of a breakfast do you call that? You're graduating. You have to go to college and play football. How do you expect to do that on one egg? That's my diet, sir. Jack, leave the boy alone. You're only making him nervous. He's making me nervous! I can't eat a thing. Now what are you doing? I'm preparing to take my pill, Dad, which will allow me to eat the egg. You want me to gain weight, don't you? Why don't you just swallow it with water? I can't take a pill that way, sir. I gag. Gag? Oh, look... You just take the pill, you put it on the back of your tongue, flush it down with water, and it's all over. I've tried that, sir, but I gag. That's ridiculous. You're not going to grow up to be a sissy!ANN: Jack, please! Will you stay out of this, Ann? After all, I'm not a villain. I have a right to show my son how to take a pill. Now, son, just relax and leave everything to me. Have you got another pill there? Give it to me. Now, you take your glass of water in your right hand. Come on. Take your pill in your left. Stick out your tongue. Way out. Now put the pill on the back of your tongue, way back. That's it, ahh. Flush it down with water. Oh, for heaven's sake. Here, I'll help you. Give me another pill. All right, now open up. Flush her down. Now, you got it? Good! Now, you see, son, it just takes a little guts and a little doing. A simple case of mind over matter, right? Now, Junior, I'm going upstairs to dress, but before I go to work, I want to have a little talk with you. See you in the den. My favorite room. Nothing like the old den for a heart-to-heart talk. I'm more proud of you every time I come in here, Dad. I wanna be proud of you. That's why I wanna have this talk. Now, sit down and relax. Have one? Oh, no, thank you, sir.Go ahead, you're old enough. Yes, sir. I guess you're not ready yet. And don't call me "sir." It sounds like I'm training you to be an English butler. This is just man talk, you and me, so relax, son. Now, what are your plans for college? Oh, well, Dad, I thought that I'd-- You'd like to go to Ridgeville. That's natural. Your grandfather went there, built the stadium. You mother went there, and I went there. I was a nine-letter man myself. So naturally you'll be there. Yes, the name Ridgeville and Jackson are one and the same thing. I know, Dad, but I thought I'd like to-- You'd like to try for the team. You're lucky. I could help you there. Coach Wheeler is a very dear friend of mine. I gave him a new gym last year, so we won't have any trouble there. But Dad, I thought... Well, I'd like to join-- Join a fraternity, naturally. You'll be an ALK man, just like your dad! We won't have any trouble there. I gave the boys a new house last year. But Dad--Yes, you'll have four grand years at Ridgeville before you come out to the plant and take over in my place. You've got a good life, Junior. I wish I were your age, just starting out, everything to look forward to. Oh, to be young again. You're a lucky boy, Junior. Dad, could I... Could I say something? Certainly, son. Well, sir, I don't want you to think that I'm disrespectful, or that I don't appreciate everything you're trying to do for me. It-- Well, I have an idea. You have an idea?Yes, sir. I wanna go to college, but I don't want to go to Ridgeville. Not go to Ridgeville? Well, there's nothing wrong with Ridgeville, sir, it's just that I became interested in animal husbandry. And there's a very wonderful school upstate, Northern California Aggie. It's a farm college, and they're very progressive. Northern California Aggie? A farm college? Well, yes, sir. It's an experimental school, and they're doing wonders with animals. For instance, the dean crossed a pig with a hybrid, and it's very interesting what came out. What?A very short pig. Uh, but the experiments aren't finished yet, Dad. I thought I might even become a vet and work with animals, 'cause they're different than human beings. They can't tell you when they're in pain. They have no way of communicating. Therefore one has to have more feelings for them than the ordinary doctor. Am I making you understand, Dad? You're making me ill. JACK: You standing there telling me that a son of mine, a Jackson, wants to go to some jerk agricultural college and study to be a horse doctor? You two boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves, in here chatting when there's so much to do. Jack, the car is waiting. And, Junior, it's your graduation day. Now, come along, Jack. Jack?Yeah, what is it? Remember, be home early. Junior's graduating tonight, and the ceremonies start at 7:30. Don't worry, I'll be there with bells on. Cow bells. "Jarring" Jack Jackson's son, a horse doctor! Mother, what's wrong with Dad and me? We don't get along. Oh, you're just imagining things. Every boy has certain disagreements with his father. That's natural. All the time, is that natural? Junior, your father's heart is set on you going to Ridgeville. I know, Mother, but I can't follow in Dad's footsteps. His shoes are too big, and I feel uncomfortable in them. You understand.Yes, I understand. Sometimes I think your father's the boy and you're the man. Now, come along. PHOTOGRAPHER: Everybody looking this way. Smile! Attention. Now, that was really good. Quiet, everybody. I would now like to get a picture of the most popular boy. President of the student body Washington High School and the greatest athlete who ever graduated, Bill Baker! All right, Bill, steady. Mr. Jackson, that's my son, Bill. That strapping, good-looking healthy specimen belongs to you? Wait a moment. I want you to have a picture taken with Babs Hunter, the most beautiful girl in our graduating class. Babs, will you come up? Babs looks wonderful, doc. You must be very proud of her. She's quite a girl. Quite a girl. Junior Jackson, will you come here a minute? No, not in the picture. I want you to hold the flash light. Now. Thank you. Hiya, Dad, how do you feel? Fine, my boy. Fine. Mr. Jackson, I want you to meet my son, Bill. Glad to meet you, young man.Nice to know you, sir. Got quite a boy there, Henry. He's got quite a handshake. Oh, quite a boy, quite a boy. Heh-heh-heh. Mr. Jackson, I know this isn't the time or the place, but I was wondering if you could see Bill tomorrow on a little personal matter.Of course, I'd be glad to. I'll see the two of you at the plant tomorrow. Good luck to you, my boy. I wish you were. That heredity business is all cockeye. Little Henry Baker? Oh, come on, Jack. Let's have some punch. Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad. Thank you.Doesn't he, Jack? He sure does.Oh, take it easy, Dad! I forgot, I'm sorry. Anyway, congratulations, son. Thank you, Dad. And thank you for the watch. See, Mother? "To Junior. Love, Dad" Oh, Jack, that's sweet. Congratulations, Junior.Oh, thank you, Dr. Hunter. Sir, would it be all right if I took Babs home tonight? Certainly, Junior. Certainly. Thank you. Dad, may I have the car? You see, I'd like a-- Of course. Have a good time. Here are the keys. Don't stay out too late. Cuts down on your wind. I'll be home early. You sure you don't mind, sir? Why, not at all, Junior. Where is Babs? I don't know, sir, but I'll find her. Little Henry Baker. Take it easy. I'll get writer's cramp. Oh, Bill, you haven't signed mine yet. You promised to sign mine too. Don't forget, I have the second dance with you. I have the third.And I have the fourth. Bill? Thanks.Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Bill.You're welcome. Could I have your autograph too? You can have anything you want. You look pretty tonight. You look pretty good yourself. Wanna dance?I'd love to. May I have this dance, Mrs. Johnson?

Henry Baker, to have a son like that. I hope Junior and Babs like each other. She's such a sweet girl. I think they'd be a nice couple. A little man, to have such a big son. It just doesn't make sense. Jack, what are you mumbling about? Oh, nothing. It's amazing. It just doesn't seem fair. I'm sorry we didn't get to dance the last waltz together, Junior. I guess we missed each other. But I looked for you. Well, anyways, you're taking me home, and I'm with you. You don't mind taking Bill home, do you? No, not at all. Thanks, Junior.

Yep, a lucky guy. Yes?WOMAN: Coach Wheeler is here. Coach Wheeler? Yes, send him right in. Yes, sir. "Jarring" Jack Jackson. Put it there. Coach Wheeler, you old son of a gun, glad to see you. What's the beef?No beef. I've got good news. Ridgeville's got a chance for the championship this year. On the level?Yep, here's the layout. There's a great athlete in this town, Bill Baker. Just graduated from Washington High School. His old man's a bookkeeper someplace. Underpaid, hasn't got a cent, works for some rich, miserable guy, so this kid doesn't have money to go to college. Eh, it's the old story, Jack. Coach, uh, I know this kid, Baker. His father works for me. He's my bookkeeper. Jack, I didn't mean to--That's all right. Forget about it. What do you want me to do? Finance this kid through school. All right, I'll do it on one condition. When my son comes to Ridgeville, you've got to see that he makes the team and gets his letter. But Jack, be reasonable. Your kid's never played football. He could be another Sammy Baugh, a great passer. Or Albie Booth, a great kicker.Well, it's possible, but-- There's no "buts" to it, Coach. I want my kid to earn his letter at Ridgeville more than anything in life. It's a package deal, Coach. If you wanna take Bill Baker, you have to take my son. Yes or no? I need this Baker boy like I need my right arm. And I need your son Junior like I need a... Okay, it's a deal. My son's here. Can you see him now, Mr. Jackson? Yes, send him right in. Mr. Jackson.Hi, Bill. Sit down. What's on your mind?I was talking with my dad, and he suggested I come here and ask for a job in your plant. Well, aren't you planning to go to college? Well, I always wanted to, but frankly, we don't have the money. What would you do if someone offered you a chance to go to Ridgeville, all expenses paid? I'd faint.Well, don't faint. Because I'm going to make you that offer. But why? Well, Bill, you know my son, Junior? Well, I spent a few hours with him last night, but I don't know him too well. That's the point. I want you to know him better. You see, he's a great kid, but he didn't turn out the way I wanted him to. I...I wanted him to be more... More like you. Well, maybe he's just a different type. You're so right. That's why I thought that maybe if the two of you were roommates at Ridgeville, that you could sort of look after him. Maybe you could inspire him to be an athlete like yourself. You know, the strong looking after the weak. What does he say about all this? He doesn't know anything about it. And he must never know. Well, what do you say? Is it a deal?It's a deal, Mr. Jackson. But you know, with Junior, it's not gonna be too easy. I only hope I have enough time left to play football. You're getting closer to Ridgeville, son. Yes? Well, hello, dear. Feeling fine, fine, yes. Delighted to have him for dinner, certainly. Good old Ben Green, my old classmate, Phi Beta Kappa. Smart as a whip. Yes, I'll be home early for dinner. All right, dear. All right. Let me get this straight, Ben. Aren't you a doctor? I'm a psychiatrist. You mean dealing with crazy people? Oh, no, Dad, a psychiatrist is a man who helps people adjust to their environment and overcome inhibitions. Huh?Very good, son. That, in essence, is what we do. You'd be surprised how many people need help and don't know it. Well, I think it's all bunk.Jack, please! That's all right. Jack hasn't offended me. A lot of people share his viewpoint. They don't know they need help. I was on a very interesting case in Chicago about a month ago. A typical case of a dominating father trying to run his son's life. Result, typical son: shy, introverted, psychosomatic symptoms. Clash of personalities, tragedy.What happened? In this case, the father committed suicide. He jumped out of a second-story window. That's very interesting, Dr. Green. Do you know of any similar cases? Well, there was another case where a father and son-- Yes, well, I don't approve of this kind of conversation in front of children. Junior, why don't you go upstairs now and get a good night's rest? Kiss your mother good night. But Dad--JACK: You heard what I said! Kiss your mother, shake hands with Dr. Green, and upstairs you go, right, son? Good night, Mother.Good night. Good night, Dad. Good night, sir.Good night. Would you know where I could get books on this subject? Son.Oh. Good night. An only child? Yes, he's our only child. Hmm, very interesting. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some things to do. Jack, I don't want to get too personal, but I think you have a problem with your son. Let me help you. A lot of people pay me fancy prices for this. You can get it free.Thanks, Ben. There is a problem, and there shouldn't be, because no one could be a better father than I am to that boy. He's going to step right in to a big business. It's all set up for him. I had it all planned for him to go to Ridgeville. Had it arranged for him to have the best room in the fraternity. Even had it fixed for him to get his letter. What do I get for it?He resents it. How did you know? Say, Ben, what is happening with this younger generation? They're ungrateful.Jack, you don't understand. He's not the problem, you are. Me? Why, there isn't a better father than I am, Ben. That boy's had the best. Well, let's not get into all that. You've done nothing for that boy. You've done it all for yourself. You're selfish, Jack. Selfish? I only want my son to be a leader. Maybe he's not a leader.Well, he's got to be! Jack, you're trying to run your son's life, and it won't work. He's not like you, and if you keep it up, you're going to run into a much worse problem than whether or not he wants to go to Ridgeville. It can become much worse. Well, what'll I do, Ben? Well, why don't you go up and visit with Ann, let me talk to Junior a few minutes. Maybe I can help. Junior, can you come down here a minute? JUNIOR: I'm getting ready for bed. Well, forget about it and come on down here... son. JUNIOR: All right, Dad. Now, remember, we want that boy to go to Ridgeville. Dr. Green here would like to have a little talk with you. You wanted to see me, sir?Yes, Junior. I'd like to have a chat with you. Well, is it all right with--Oh, yes, yes. Let's go on in the den where we can be more comfortable. Oh, if you don't mind, sir, could we talk someplace else? You see...You don't have to explain. I understand. Would the patio be better? I think so.Fine. You don't like the den, Junior. Why? Oh, it's a nice room. It's my father's favorite. But it's his room. You understand. Mm-hm. Very interesting. Of course. Anyway, it's a nice night, so let's just make ourselves comfortable and have a pleasant chat, hm? Junior, I'd like to ask you a few questions. You don't mind, do you?Oh, no, sir. I like talking to you.Good. Now that you've graduated from high school, what would you like to do? Well, will it be confidential, just between the two of us? Confidential. Well, sir, I'd like to go to Ridgeville, and I'd like to play football, but I never will. Why not?Because of my dad. Don't get me wrong, sir, I love him and I respect him, and I'd like to do everything he did, but I never will, because I couldn't do it as good. I'm scared. How do you know you couldn't do it as good? Well, no one is as good as my dad, sir. Just ask him. He does everything the best. That's why I do everything the worst. I got what you call complexes. And I don't mean to be disrespectful, sir, but I'm frustrated. Have you ever told your dad what you would like to do? Oh, no, sir. You can't tell him anything. He tells you. Why don't you try to meet your dad halfway? Talk it out with him. Try to show him your side of it. You take the initiative. You know, older people are more set in their ways. I think you owe it to your dad and yourself to try to become better acquainted with him. I'll try, Dr. Green.Fine. You can go to bed now, Junior, if you'd like. Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.Good night. Ben, what's wrong with him? Nothing, Jack. He's a fine boy. I think someday you're going to be proud of him. I would suggest, however, that you try to see more of him alone, get to know him better. Well, I'd like to, Ben, but it seems like every time we're together, we fight. I think the boy resents me. It's... It's unnatural. On the contrary, Jack, it's the most natural thing in the world for children to resent their parents. It's based on the fact that from the time they're born, parents represent authority, interfere with their will. So the average normal child often resents his parents. Some children wish they had different parents, some children hate their parents. What about Junior? Do you think he hates me? Hates you? The only advice I can give is... never take your boy hunting. Who is it?JACK: It's me. Just a minute, Dad. Come in, Dad. Son... ...I think we ought to become better acquainted, don't you? I think so. A father and a son ought to be, well, close, more like buddies. Don't you think so?I think so. Tomorrow's Sunday. Why don't we spend the whole day together, just you and I, alone. You know, like... Like pals. I'd like that, Dad. Good. What would you like to do, son? Anything you'd like to do, Dad.Well, no, it's your day. Now, what would you like to do? Anything you'd like to do, Dad. Now, I'm asking you--! Goodness. What would you like to do, son? Well, I have a splendid idea, Dad. Something I think we'll both enjoy. Oh, what is it? Would you take me hunting? If that's what you really want to do. Careful with that gun, it may be loaded. No, it isn't. See? Will you be careful with that thing? You know it's loaded!I know it, Dad. You know, an accident can happen. It'd be a terrible thing if you shot your own father. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha-ha! What are you grinning about? I'm so happy. I'm having such a good time, Dad. I think we'll find some game over there. Now, son, why don't you go in front of me? I want you to have the first shot. No, Dad, you go in front of me. No, son, now, you go in front of me. I'll cover your rear. No, Dad, I'll be in back of you. You first. Ooh, it's a fine specimen, isn't it, Dad? Really is, son. Let's have a little nip to celebrate! Join me, son? Oh, I've never had a drink.You're a man now. Anybody that can shoot like that can have a nip. I'd rather you have it with me. You have my permission. Son, here's to you and Ridgeville. JACK & JUNIOR : ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ He's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ That nobody can deny ♪ Well!Evening, madam. Good evening, Mother. What is this all about? Just a little evening between father and son. Perfectly normal.Perfectly normal. You've both been drinking. Drinking? That's ridiculous. Just a little celebration of Junior deciding to go to Ridgeville. Right, son? Right, Dad! May! May! Hi. This is room 24, isn't it?Yeah. What are you trying to do, grow up to be a rabbit? No, these are my Dr. Denton pajamas in case I get a chill. Well, I guess you and I are gonna be roommates. Huh? Why? I don't know why. They just assigned me to room 24. Oh. What's the matter, did you expect to bunk alone? No, no, I was just wonderin' why the two of us are roommates, that's all. Just wonderin'.I don't know why. They just put us together, I guess. Okay? Yeah, okay. Do you mind if I have a drawer? Oh, no, no. I didn't know. I'll get them out. Would you like the top drawer or the bottom drawer? It makes no difference to me. It makes no difference to me. It makes no difference to me. It makes no difference to me. Will one drawer be enough? One is plenty. More shirts? JUNIOR: Oh, no, these are my medications. Oh, you're planning to become a doctor? Oh, no, you see, I haven't been too well. You want the upper shelf or the lower shelf of the medicine chest?BILL: Either one. I don't have too much. The lower one is easier to get to. BILL: Makes no difference to me. Makes no difference to me. If you ever have sinus, this will clear it up in a minute. Just two drops in each nostril, and you'll breathe again. Of course, a little will trickle down your throat, but I have a pill for that which clears it up. Well, I wouldn't have any use for that. I'm pretty healthy. Oh, that's nice. You wanna sleep in the upper or the lower? Makes no difference. Makes no difference to me.Makes no difference to me. You gonna make up your mind, or you gonna drive me nuts? Don't get huffy. I'll take the lower. Fine. I think I better take the upper. Why? Uh, it's drafty here in the lower. My sinus, remember? Okay. I better go back to the lower. Why? I'm gettin' a nosebleed up here. It's too high.Okay, any way you want. Good night, Bill.Good night, Junior. Aren't you gonna open a window?Why, you warm? Gotta sleep with a window open. You wanna be healthy, don't you? I do? I mean, I do. I'll get it. BILL: I said open it! Bill? What are you doin'?Oh, nothin'. You closin' the window?No. Don't you believe me?I believe you, but open it. I hope we'll become friends and like rooming together. You know, roommates and pals. Bill, are you asleep? Coach, that Baker kid's great. Look at that punt, 70 yards. Yeah, he's all right. We've got a good chance, boys. I've never seen a better football player since "Jarring" Jack Jackson played for Ridgeville. We got a break when they changed the freshman ruling. All right, you guys, over on the dummy! Come on, move, on the double! Coach Wheeler?Yes? I'm ready to report, sir. Who you gonna report, and for what? Me, I'm ready to play football. Look, I'll save you a broken neck. The Ping-Pong team needs an anchorman. But sir-- Look, you're too light for football! Sorry. But you wrote me a letter, and it said Junior Jackson to report. What'd you say your name was?Junior Jackson. Oh. Oh, yes, Junior Jackson. I didn't recognize you. Must you wear glasses? Oh, no, sir. Only when I wanna see. Okay, get in with the rest of the boys. We're hittin' the dummy.Yes, sir! Nice one. Junior, you hurt? No, I'm all right. I must've stumbled. Here, let me help you up. I don't need any help. I'm all right. The kid's like his old man. He's got guts. As far as being a football player, there the resemblance ends. Grass drill, running in place. Ready, begin! COACH: Bring those knees up! On your stomach! On your back! On your stomach! On your feet! On your right side! Left side! On your feet! On your back! Right side! On your feet! All right, bring those knees up! Hold it! All right, all the backs on the chinning bar, linemen around the goalpost and into the showers. You need any help?No, I can make it. When? The football season will be over. Bill? Yeah? Is this good for me?Well, of course. How come I'm getting nauseous? Hop on the table, buddy. I'll take these.Oh, I can't see without them. You'd be better off. Ow! Oof! It's all in the neck, son. All in the neck. Gotta straighten out that spine. Now, just relax, boy. Just relax. Better? Yeah, but what happened to the head? Ah... Junior? Junior?JUNIOR: I'm in here. What are you doing? Nothin'. I'm just sittin' here. Why? Why? Where can I go? The whole body's broken. So I'm just sittin' here. But I ain't got nerve enough to put my head under the water. Well, where's it hurt?Where does it hurt? Where doesn't it hurt? It's easier. I know just the thing. I'll go get something to fix you up. What is it?What you need's a good rubdown. I'll go get some alcohol.Oh, no! Come in. You're Bill Baker, first year at school. Wear shirt size 15 1/2, 40 regular in jacket, hate ties, like soft white shirts, and haven't much money. Wow, what are you, a walking department store? No, let me introduce myself. My card. "Terry Howard, college representative of nationally known brands. Buy at your convenience. Don't come see me, I'll see you. Save half by seeing Terry Howard first." What are you selling? I have some of the finest cashmere you've ever seen. Feel that material. Crush it in your hands. Once a girl gets a load of cashmere like that, she'll never let you alone. Let me show you my sports clothes. I have to go--You haven't seen the argyles. Socks to match your eyes. Every color, every description. And the luscious maroon sweater to go with those wavy locks. Well, a salesman with sex appeal, huh? Strictly business. This is the way I work my way through college. Now, what can I give you? I don't think you have it in that sample case. Just a minute. Let's stick to business, huh? I know when I'm outmatched. I can't afford any new clothes. I'll see you around. JUNIOR: Bill, Bill! Junior Jackson, size 9 shoe, 10 1/2 sock and 13 1/2 shirt. JUNIOR: I'm dying. I'm dying! Are you Junior Jackson? Yeah.Are you decent? I've always tried to live a clean life. No, I mean are you in the bathtub? Yeah, I'm taking a bubble bath. I'm Terry Howard, college representative of some of the finest manufacturers in the country. For new customers, we have an introductory offer, these nylon swimming trunks, absolutely no cost on your part. Here, put them on. Although I haven't seen you, I know you're the type that would like a dark cashmere suit, very suitable for evening wear in place of a tuxedo. Can I come in?Yeah. Gee, a girl saleslady. What kind of college is this, Vassar? Oh, a milk bath. We have a much better product, Pink Tonic. It's cheaper and the bubbles last longer. Please, if you don't mind-- Let me show you these cashmere jackets. This one has a belt in the back and is very sporty. And this dark blue is very suitable for evening wear in place of a tuxedo. Oh, yes, of course this one is English-made. You have the shoulders for it, I notice. Please, lady, forget the clothes. I just wanna get my body back. There's no obligation on your part, so let me finish. It's hard to tell what you would wear. I haven't much to go on. Look, miss...You can call me Terry. You're Junior Jackson.How do you know? Oh, I have a line on every new student who comes here. You do this for a gag? Not at all. You see, it's the only way I can get my education. Some girls are waitresses. I'm a salesgirl. I prefer it. Anyway, it helps me in my psychology training. You see, I'm a psychology major.Gee, I wish I had your spirit. I'm glad to meet a girl like you. Oh... Oh, just happen to have the thing for you. This striped robe, marked down from 45 to 22. Well, it just so happens I need a robe. But you'll have to leave the room. TERRY: Bill! STUDENT: See you at the house. Hi.Hi. How come I haven't seen you lately? Football season. What's the matter, don't you ever relax? Sometimes.Why don't you try it some night? Say tonight, for instance. I'm not doing anything. Look, Terry, I know you're about as good-looking as they come on this campus, but I also know there are three things that'll stop a guy from playing football. That's being with a dame, going with a dame and liking a dame. So I'll see you around. Nine tennis sneakers, size 10. One dozen silk ties.Nine tennis sneakers... Three socks, size 8 1/2. One dozen argyle, size 9 1/2. One dozen v-neck sweaters. Uh, formerly $8, on sale for $9. Formerly $8, on sale for $9? The price of living's gone up all over. Junior, you've been a great help to me. I can't thank you enough. Terry, will you tell me something? What? How does someone become like you? Don't try. I'd rather be rich like you. No, I mean, you have so much confidence in yourself. It's all a matter of ego, Junior. That's what psychology teaches you. Ego?Sure. You see, Junior, you've gotta believe in yourself. You've gotta keep saying over and over, "I'm big, I'm big!" Now, say it.I'm big. No, no, no, Junior. Believe it. Out, out! Throw your chest out. It's difficult for me. I'm skinny. Well, spiritually then. Put your shoulders back, walk up and down, be cocky. Say, "I'm big, I'm big! You hear me, I'm big!" I'm big, I'm big! You hear me? I'm big. Well, it's a start in the right direction. And that's what you've got to believe, and I'll help you. You'll sort of be my guinea pig in my psychology experiment. Guinea pig? Come in. Who is it?It's me, Junior. Well, come on in.I can't. Help me! Well, why can't you--? What is this? Christmas is months away. What are you doing? I just had a date with Terry. You better stop seeing that dame. We won't have any room to sleep here. Oh, no, Bill. She's wonderful, and so good for my ego. The least I could do was buy some things. Look at this dressing jacket I bought. It can also be used for grouse hunting. You know, it's reversible. You have to live in England for it, but it's practical. Of course. Where's the monocle? She didn't have any in stock. She's ordering it. It's due next week.Grand. Bill?What? I'll tell you a secret.Go ahead. I think I'm stuck on Terry.I'd have never guessed it. She's the first girl I ever had that took a personal interest in me. She certainly took a personal interest in you, all right. Would you do me a favor?Well, it all depends. You ever hear of Cyrano de Bergerac? Cyrano de Bergerac? Didn't he play end for Cornell? No, he was a character in a very famous play, and he had a big nose and he was very ugly. He sent his best friend to talk for him to the girl he loved because he was self-conscious about his nose. So?So I'm worse than Cyrano. I'm self-conscious about all of me. So I thought you could go see Terry and tell her how I feel about her... Why me? Well, because you have an easy way with the women, and you're a big football hero. Would you do that for me, Bill? You just gotta! Why must I "just gotta"? Look at all this stuff. I'm runnin' out of money! Come in. Oh, hi, Bill.Hi. What can I do for you? You need some shirts? Always selling, aren't you? A gal's gotta live.You sure are living. I brought over a check for the stuff you sold Junior. When are you gonna stop selling him clothes? Well, he needed clothes badly. And I see you did all right for yourself too. I always say a man can't have too many clothes. What do you always say? I always say I think the kid's stuck on you. You're kidding!Who else but a guy in love would buy 15 pairs of shoes, and all of them tennis sneakers? I'm interested in Junior as a psychological study. He's sort of snooky, you know.Yeah, but he's a great guy. You'd be lucky to get somebody like him. What do you mean?Trouble with dames is you have no vision. Most of you go for a big, husky, broad-shouldered good-looking football-hero type. So? Someday Junior's gonna be like that. Bill?Yes? How long do you think it'll take him? It'll take him quite a while. To be like you?Yes. Well, why should I wait then? "Dear folks, it seems hard to realize "that a month has gone by since I left home. "I like Ridgefield pretty much. "I'm rooming with a swell fellow, Bill Baker, "who was in our graduating class. He's been very nice to me."He ought to be, hm! What'd you say, dear? Nothing, go on.Oh. "I also like a girl named Terry Howard. "She's very unusual and has a forceful personality. I think Dad will like her." I thought he liked Doc Hunter's girl, Babs. Well, kids that age are fickle. Besides, she's here, and he's at college. Forget about his love life. Go on with the important things. "Tell Dad that much to my surprise, "I'm still on the football squad. "I can't understand it, because try as I might, "I'm not improving fast enough. "The coach doesn't like me or dislike me. "He just seems nervous when I'm around. "But I hardly think he'll let me in the first game, "so there's no reason for you and Dad to come up. "I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can. Love, Junior." I miss the boy. You'll get to see him this weekend when we go up for the game. It says he doesn't think he'll get in the game. Yeah, well, "Jarring" Jack Jackson's son will be in that first game, I can promise you that! May! Oh, May! STUDENTS: R-I... D-G... E-V... I-L... L-E! Ridgeville! Ridgeville! Go, Ridgeville! All right, men, attention! I want you to meet Ridgeville's most distinguished alumnus, who's gonna say a few words to you. This is the famous "Jarring" Jack Jackson. Men, I'm going to be short and to the point. I just had three rules when I played football: you hit 'em fast, you hit 'em low, and you hit 'em hard. If they get up, you hit 'em again. So let's get out on that field and play guts football. Remember, you're playing for Ridgeville. So good luck to you all, and let 'em have it! Come on, let's go! Wait, Junior. I wanna talk to you. Gee, Dad, I better get out there. This will only take a minute, Junior. You could make this the happiest day in my life if you just get out there and really play football! I don't even know if I'll get in the game. Don't worry, I have a feeling that you will. I hope so. I better get out there. You know, you're not gonna just run out on the field like the rest of the players, you're gonna make an entrance! What do you mean, sir?You see this old number 66? That's your dad's old jersey! When I quit playing football 20 years ago, they retired that number, and nobody has worn it until now. You're gonna put this on and really make an entrance in this jersey. People are gonna see another Jackson coming out wearing old number 66 to play for good old Ridgeville. How do you feel, son?Isn't it a little large, Dad? Well, tuck it in! Remember, live up to old number 66. Old "Jarring" Jack Jackson's number. Now go to it, boy! Good afternoon, fans. This is Tom Harmon speaking from the stadium, where today we'll bring you the game between Ridgeville and Thornton University. The game today, of course, is the opening of the season, and it promises to be a whale of a football game. The captains return to their teams, and they're now getting their final instructions from the coach. There they go to line up for the kickoff. Jones will kick off for Thornton. Yes, that's right. And back in the receiving position for Ridgeville is Tom Edwards and Bill Baker, Ridgeville's All-American candidate. Jones signals, the ball clubs get ready-- He approaches the ball. It's a long end-over-end kick going way downfield. It's going to Baker. He takes it on the seven yard line. He's at the 10, the 20, he's got some nice blocks, he's at the 35... Straight-arms two tacklers. Well, he's going to go all the way! He's on the two yard line and rolls into the end zone for a touchdown! It certainly seems apparent that if this Baker boy continues to spark the Ridgeville team as he has done today all season, the playoff for the Rose Bowl will be between Ridgeville and that great University of California team. You see that? You couldn't have done better. Very good, very good. When are you gonna send Junior in? HARMON: The teams are lining up for the extra point now. Smith will hold and Baker will kick. Get set. One, two, three! HARMON: There's the pass from center... And it's good! And Ridgeville leads, 7-nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, I like to be conservative when I talk about football, but I would like to make a prediction here. This club looks like the greatest team that they've had in 20 years, and why? Simply because of one man, Bill Baker. That boy's an All-American if I've ever seen one. All right, Coach, how about Junior? Okay, Jackson, get in. Me? Wait a minute, there's a substitution. They're taking Baker out, and I certainly don't blame them. There's no sense in risking an injury at this time. The substitute for Bill Baker is number... 66. Number 66? Let's try K97 on two. Uh, that's a pleasant play. We might enjoy ourselves with that one. Unless you'd rather have, uh, K97 on four. That's more strenuous, but we might get through with it. No, we better do K97 on two. PLAYER: On two, break. HARMON: They're out of the huddle now. Oh, oh, fellas, I have a better idea. I'm sorry, will you come back? HARMON: Oh, they're back in the huddle again. Take it easy, Coach, take it easy. The boy will come through. You'll have to excuse us, but this is private. HARMON: Heh, Jackson's apparently having a little trouble with his signal. My heavens, you're nosy! Come on. Delay of the game! HARMON: Ridgeville's penalized five yards for delaying the game. It's now third down, 20 yards to go, Ridgeville's ball on Thornton's 47-yard line. Take it easy, Coach. Take it easy. The boy will come through. Spread flanker left, spread flanker right. B.G. opposite, two lead swing, 36 A.O. on four. PLAYER: On four, break. HARMON: Ridgeville comes out of the huddle. They go into an unusual spread formation, no blockers. One, two, three, four, five.HARMON: Jackson back... ball is snapped, Jackson has it. He's smothered back at his own 45-yard line. He fumbles! There's a big pile-up down on the field. I think-- Yes, they did! Thornton recovered the fumble! Ladies and gentlemen, so far in this game young Jackson has not been anything like his father, believe me. But then too, Thornton's had their troubles. They're going to have to go into punt formation and kick. It's Philips back in punt formation. There's the snap from center. He gets off a long spiral kick that comes down the field. Jackson waits for it on the 20-yard line. Well, he's caught it. He's off, there he goes. The 25, the 30, the 35, he's at midfield. A Thornton man grabs him with a necktie tackle, but Jackson is still on his feet! Wait a minute, Jackson is running the wrong way! He's back at the Thornton 40, the 30, the 10, the 5-- He's hit by his own man on the five-yard line and fumbles, and Thornton recovers for a touchdown! Listen to that crowd boo! Get in there and take that-- That-that kid's place! They're taking Junior Jackson out of the ball game and putting Bill Baker back in. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, Junior Jackson is nothing like his father. He'll win ball games, perhaps, but I'm afraid for the other team. This has been the worst day of my life. How could my own son do this to me? It's not all Junior's fault.Ann... you see before you the mere shell of a man. A man who's devoted his entire life to his child. And look what happens. He makes a touchdown for the other team. Is there no justice?Oh, don't be so dramatic. It's only a football game. Only a football game? Out there in front of all of my old classmates, in front of 20,000 students, the son of "Jarring" Jack Jackson disgraces himself? Is there anything worse? Yes, he could've been a criminal. Well, that wouldn't have been so bad. At least we could've sent him away and no one would know. Jack, I'm not going to stand here and have you berate Junior. He probably feels bad enough.Ann... ...are you sure he's our son? Oh, stop it, Jack! He was born at home. Oh, yeah, that's right. I haven't even got the satisfaction of thinking they might've switched him on us in the hospital. Junior Jackson, what are you doing in this empty stadium at night without your coat on? You'll catch your death of cold! I'm sorry, Mother. Junior, I'm worried about you. Do you still want to play football? I like it, but I guess I'll never get a chance now. Coach will drop me from the squad. Gee, today I disgraced everybody. Son, listen to me. You were at a disadvantage. It isn't the easiest thing to be the son of a great athlete. A prominent father's the biggest drawback a boy can have. Don't I know!So from now on, your father will not dominate you. You'll be left to make your own decisions. I'll see to that. You're going to stop playing football... But--take up your regular studies, and you're going to shower and have dinner immediately. But I don't--From now on, you have nothing to worry about. You can make up your own mind. You're a man. Come along, son. Yes, ma'am. Bill, Mr. Jackson wants to talk to you. Be seeing you, Jack. Thanks. Sit down, Bill. You played a great game this afternoon, boy. Reminded me a little of me.Thank you. Of course, you can't pass like me or run like me. You don't hit the line like I used to, but you reminded me a little of me. There'll never be another you, sir. Thank you, son. Bill, you remember the proposition I made you. Coach Wheeler is dropping Junior from the squad. But our deal is still on. Mr. Jackson, you don't understand. I like living with Junior. We're getting to be great friends. You don't have to pretend.But I'm not pretending. I understand, Bill. You're loyal, and you're just trying to make it easier for me. Your father should be a very happy man. I know that I would be. Bill, you'll still get my check every month. You've lived up to your part of the bargain. Well, that's very generous of you, sir, but... Well, thank you. Coach?Yes, Bill? I was talking to Mr. Jackson. You can't drop Junior. Why not? Didn't he say it was okay? It might be okay with him, but it's not okay with me. You gotta give him another chance. Now, wait a minute. Either Junior plays, or I don't play. You don't have to--That's the way I want it. Now, what do you say? Getting tougher to be a coach every day. Okay, but you better be good next Saturday. With your methods, you gotta have a lot of talent. Don't worry, I got it. Terry, I'm through double-crossing Junior. Take it easy.Don't tell me to take it easy. You talked me out of it before. I'm through being a heel. I'm gonna tell him.But it's so bad for his ego! Never mind his ego. It's more honest this way. Okay, but I'll handle it. I wanna break it to him gently. I don't wanna shatter his confidence. When are you gonna tell him?Next time I see him. Good. It's the only fair thing to do. JUNIOR: Terry, can I come in a minute? I don't want him to find me here. Quick, in the closet.You be sure you tell him. Leave everything to me. I just came over to say goodbye. I'm leaving school. Leaving school? Why? I ran out of reasons. Today on the football field, I disgraced my father and the team. Now I'm being dominated by my mother, and she's almost as bad as my father. I shouldn't have come to Ridgeville. Oh, sit down, Junior. Let's talk this out. There's nothing to talk about. I'm a failure. Oh, don't get excited, Junior. Something will turn up to give you your confidence back. I'm a failure. The only reason Bill lived with me is because he felt sorry for me. And you try to help because you're a nice person. Besides, I'm a good customer. No, I'm leaving school. Oh, but Junior, if you leave school, I'll feel very bad. You will?Well, yes. I like you for yourself. You do?Well, sure. And I think if you stick it out, you'll prove to your father and to everybody that you're a man. Well, I could do it, Terry, if... If...Yes? If I had a girl like you behind me. I mean, if I thought that you thought that I was somebody. And I do think you are. Terry, I been stuck on you since the day you sold me the robe when I was in the bath. Well, I liked you too, Junior, but I've gotta tell you about Bill and me. We can talk about Bill some other time. If you wear my fraternity pin, I won't leave school. Well, how will that help? Well, it'll give me a reason to stay. It'll be a little victory. It'll restore my confidence. That's what you said I needed. Just wear it a little while and see if you like it. Well, okay, but on one condition, that you won't leave school. Oh, no, I won't. I'm a new man. I'm a tiger. I'm big! You're wearing my fraternity pin! I'm big! Well, you certainly told him. What did you expect me to do with everybody browbeating him? He needed someone to turn to, and this was no time to sell him shirts. Well, what about you and me?We'll have to wait. I'll have to be Junior's girl until he builds up confidence. But you love me.Of course. This is just for Junior. Okay, just for Junior. JUNIOR: I can't go on with this! Sure you can. It's all for you. Yeah, Junior, it's all for you. Come on, once more. I told you to crouch. Crouch! I told you a million times, use your body, your knees. I can't go on with this. Sure you can. It's all for you. Yeah, it's all for you. Come on, we'll try it once more. REFEREE: Let's go! Set! One, two, three, four, five! Now? Not now. CROWD: Sit down, sit down! Fine. Kick the ball. Set! One, two, three, four! Good kick! You're developing into a great kicker. I'm getting more confidence too. Maybe I'll get in the homecoming game. Sure you will. Don't you feel better? Oh, sure, and I owe it all to you two, my best friends. And I'll always be grateful to you for this. That's okay.It's all for you, Junior. Now? Not now.

That's why I want you to know.Know what? After the game tomorrow, I'm throwing a party. I'm gonna introduce Terry to my folks. If they like one another, well, you never can tell. You might be my best man.You mean -- Yeah, aren't you happy about the idea? Yeah, I think it's real great. I'm only sorry I can't be with you, but I have a party of my own to go to. Hey, Bill... Who is it?BILL: It's me, your boyfriend. What are you doing here? It's after hours. I've just come up to congratulate the bride. Hope you and Junior--What are you talking about? You've been drinking. It's the night before the game! So what? Besides, drunk or sober, I know when I'm being double-crossed. What's come over you? You ought to know. You planned it that way. Me, Bill Baker, big All-American. Big All-American sucker!I don't understand. You wouldn't understand. First I let his old man buy me through college, then I let my girlfriend talk me into playing second fiddle. All for Junior.We agreed it was for his ego. What about my ego? Everything for Junior's ego. I'm tired of it. I come to tell you I'm tired of it. Shh, someone will hear you!Don't shush me! I'm tired of playing games. What's going on with you two? Glad you asked that question, madam. That's what I come up to find out. HARMON: Ladies and gentlemen, this has been one of Ridgeville's saddest homecoming games. Without Bill Baker, they've put up a good fight, but Wilton is winning, 7-nothing. There's only five minutes left to play. Ridgeville has called time-out. I never should've let you room with a boy like that. I'd rather not talk about him. One chance in a million for a championship, and that kid's gotta get loaded. Why did he do it? Why did he pick last night? Coach, you gonna let Junior in? Please, Dad.Oh, yeah. Son, maybe some of living with Baker rubbed off on you. Loosen up. I've gotta talk to you about Bill. Forget it, Terry. I thought he was my friend. He is! That's why he's in this trouble. He wanted to tell you about your father's money and that we loved each other, but I wouldn't let him, because we were trying to build up your ego. In building you up, he thought I double-crossed him. That's why he came to my room drunk and got himself expelled, and it's all your fault! What can I do to make it up? There's only one thing to do. Stop being self-centered and dependent on other people. Get out there and stand on your own legs. You have reason to have confidence now. Bill helped you. Now get out there and help Bill! Okay, Terry, I'll try. All right, there's two minutes left. Get in there. Coach, I'd like to ask you something. Did Bill keep me on the squad? I'd like to ask you a favor. What is it?Could I wear Bill's jersey? Fred, got 32's jersey?FRED: Yeah, here it is. Okay, hurry it up. Junior Jackson is wearing Bill Baker's number 32. Junior Jackson is going into the game for Ridgeville. K24 on three.PLAYER: On three, break! HARMON: Ridgeville's ball on Wilton's 20-yard line. Set! One, two, three! HARMON: The ball is snapped. He starts to circle his left end. No, wait, he's running back towards his own goal! Junior is running the wrong way! No, wait a minute. He's reversing his field. He picks up his blockers. He's back to the 40, the 30... the 20, the 10, the five! Junior Jackson scores a touchdown for Ridgeville! What a beautiful tactical maneuver! That's my boy! That's my Junior! The score is now 7-6, with Wilton leading. Jackson covered almost 90 yards on that touchdown run. Well, now it'll be Ridgeville's turn to try for this all-important extra point. It will be Ryan who will attempt the extra point for Ridgeville. But Coach, I could've made the extra point. You've been seeing too many movies where the hero goes in at the last minute and wins the game. That touchdown you made was a miracle, thanks. Sit down. HARMON: There's the snap from center. There's the kick. It's no good! So Wilton leads by a score of 7-6 with but one minute left to play. That missed kick may have been the ball game. Ridgeville lining up for the kickoff. They'll kick off to Wilton. There's the kick. A long kick coming down the field. Barton takes it. He's going to run it out. He's back to the five, the 10, the 15, the 23-- He's hit at the 23 and goes down and he fumbles! And I believe Ridgeville recovers! Yes, they did, so it'll be first down and 10 yards to go for Ridgeville. With five seconds left to play in the ball game, now we'll see whether or not Ridgeville can capitalize on this break. Ridgeville has called for a time-out. Coach, you gotta put Junior in. He's a great kicker. I've been practicing with him. He's a Jackson. I tell you, he'll come through. Junior, it's a tough spot. You'll be kicking from the 29 yard line. A stiff wind blowing. What do you say? I'll do the best I can, Coach. Okay, it's crazy, but go in. And good luck. HARMON: Coach Wheeler's making a substitution. He's taking Ryan out and putting young Jackson in. Apparently Ridgeville is going to try a field goal from an almost impossible angle. PLAYER: Break! I wonder what's going through young Jackson's mind now. You can do it, Junior. You're big now. Do it for Bill. Remember all the hours we practiced? Take your time. You can do it. HARMON: There's the kick. It's up, up, up. It's over for a field goal! The gun goes off, and Ridgeville wins by a score of 9-7! That's my boy! That's my Junior! HARMON: What a hero Junior Jackson will be in this town tonight. The entire Ridgeville team is swarming out on the field. They've got Jackson on their shoulders and carrying him off the field. Well, what a football game that boy has played today! Well, Terry, all misunderstandings cleared away? You happy?Very happy. I am too. Oh, there's Bill. Let's go tell him the news. Bill, we've got some news for you. Congratulations, but it's not news anymore. You don't understand. Will you dance with Terry? She wants it that way. Right, Terry? Well, I don't want--Please, Bill. And I want it that way. She's for you. Okay, pal?Okay, pal. Junior!Hiya, Babs. I've been looking all over for you. You know, I can't tell you how thrilled I was this afternoon. You're just the best football player that ever was in the whole wide world. I guess I was just lucky. Lucky? Why, you just thrilled me. You know, I've always liked you, ever since high school. Yeah, you did?Of course. Couldn't you tell?Well, I-- Well, you'll be able to tell from now on, sugar. What have you got for your little Babs? Close your eyes, pucker up your lips... Bye. Dad, see, I wore my letter! That's nice, son, but where are your glasses? Well, since I won the game this afternoon and I'm a hero, I don't need them anymore. Doc Hunter was right, it was psychosomatic! But Dad, aren't you pleased about the letter? Son, you've taught me there are more important things in life than football. Will you please autograph my program? Mine too.Certainly, happy to do it. Who's talking to you? We mean him. Yeah, who does that old geezer think he is? That "old geezer" is my dad, "Jarring" Jack Jackson, the greatest football player ever turned out at Ridgeville. So what? We saw you this afternoon. For our money, you're the greatest. I'm going out for football next season. Could you give me some advice? Well, there were three things when I played football. You hit 'em low, you hit 'em fast, and you hit 'em hard. And if they get up, you hit 'em again. Yes, sir, you gotta play guts football. BOY 1: Thanks, Junior. BOY 2: Yeah, thanks a lot, Junior. JUNIOR: Okay. I'm sorry, Dad. That's all right, son. That's my boy!
