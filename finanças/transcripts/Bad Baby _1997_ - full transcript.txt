[ babbling ] You're busted, mister. Now just hand over the cake and come along peacefully to the bathtub. What--? [ giggling ] Come on, Eubie. [ Eubie giggling ] Hi! Surprise! I swear, Eubie, sometimes it seems like there's 10 of you. [ Eubie squeals ] Oh, my. [ Eubie squeals ] Hey, hi. [ giggles ] Ta-da! [ babbles, giggles ] 'Ake up! 'Ake up! 'Ake up! Wow! Eubie...?

[ yelping ] Another Eubie nightmare, sweetheart? He was-- he was everywhere. I know. I know. Just try and go back to sleep, honey. [ snores loudly ] Mom? Mom! You woke Princess Trolla up and now she can't go back to sleep! Oh, sorry, Kell. Maybe if you told her a bedtime story? I don't think so. She's not very sleepy anymore. Right, Princess Trolla? "That is correct, Kelly!" Well, at least try, Kelly. 'Ake up! No! Buh-Buh! Where Buh-Buh? Help! Buh-Buh! No Buh-Buh! Help! Help! 'Ake up! 'Ake up! Did you lose your Buh-Buh again, sweetheart? Help! Buh-Buh! Where Buh-Buh? Aw-ww... Eubie. Where Buh-Buh? Where Buh-Buh? He lost his bear again? Buh-Buh! Where Buh-Buh? Find Buh-Buh! Find the bear! Find the bear so we can all get some sleep. Okay, let's see. Penguin? Check! Beaver? Check! Something on toast with fuzzy green mold. Check! Moose? Check! I'll check under-- ow! Ugh! Here. Dum da-da-da! [ gasps ] Buh-Buh! Oobie love Buh-Buh! Oh-hh... Thanks, Kell. Sweetheart, now that Kelly's found your Buh-Buh, you can go back to sleep, all right? Good night, buddy. [ cooing ] Night-night. Shh. Night-night. Do you really think he'll go to sleep? [ giggling ] [ babbling ] Looks like another long night. Uh-huh. And then, the big truck said, "Vroom-vroom! If I don't pull over at a motel and get some sleep--" [ yawns ] "I'm gonna hit a telephone pole or something." The End. No. No. Again, Daddy. More, more.

That darn thing always bites me! Don't take it personally. He bites everyone but Eubie. Now you be a good little-- ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch, Ouch! Ouch! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk-honk! [ engine starts ] Dad, hurry! Hang on, Kell. Eubie will quiet down the second we get rolling. [ engine rattles ] Vroom! Hurry, honey. One more time. [ engine chugs ] And we're off! [ parents sigh ] I don't understand. Why can't Eubie sleep in the bed like a normal person? He's not normal, Kell. He's a baby. And you should try-- I know, I know. I should try not to get too mad at a baby. It's just that it's yucky when I fall asleep in the car. My face, it gets all sweaty, and then it sticks to the seat, and it's-- ugh! Just do your best, sweetheart. Good night. "Good night, Kelly. Good night, Kelly's family." She's such a good sport. Yeah. Great kid. We have two great kids. I can't believe this one is gonna be two in a few days. I can't believe it either. We have to start saving for college. Do you know how expensive college is these days? I mean we're gonna need at least 17 years to save that kind of money. And don't forget about all the expense in the meantime. There's in-line skates and braces and a new car, and there's summer camp and swimming lessons, and a new car, and what if Eubie wants to learn to play the drums, or the tuba, even? And come to think of it, we might need a new car. Okay, okay. I'll stop. But tomorrow, I'm asking Mr. Rock for a raise. I want to start bringing in some money myself. I've even been talking to Betty down at the gourmet coffee shop about maybe stocking some of my desserts. Hey, being a mom's already a full-time job, honey. I know. But it doesn't pay a dime. But if I could work at home, we could avoid putting Eubie in day care. Well, I'm sure the daycare people would like to avoid that too, honey. Oh, you! [ both laughing ] You're a good dad, Corny. Well, you're a good mom, Gloria. No, let him sleep. Hmm? Oh, okay. [ snoring ] [ birds chirping ] [ loud honking ] [ yelps, gasps ] [ horn honks ] 'Ake up! [ giggles ] Good morning, Eubie. Mom, my face is dented! Those lines will be gone in a few minutes, Kelly. They're just upholstery marks. Ow! Ouch! Argh! Oh, no. Ooh-- oh! Sorry! Okay! [ motor buzzing ] Look out-- whoa! Whoa! All right, okay--! Okay, Timmy, get control. Gotta get control. Oop! Free paper on me! I got the motor scooter for my birthday, Mr. Goode! Congratulations, Timmy! And it's good to see that you're wearing your helmet. Yeah, but I can't see too good with it on! [ car horn honks ] Whoa! Thank you, Timmy. You're welcome, Mr. Goode! Argh! Morning, Eubie. Moozy!

She's helping me with my show-and-tell. It's gonna be about-- Pinchess Toll! Pinchess Toll! Sorry, Eubie. Princess Trolla wouldn't be very happy if she went to show-and-tell with oatmeal in her hair. "I would be forced to banish you from my kingdom." Pinchess! Pinchess Toll! Pinchess Toll! Anyway, my show-and-tell is about-- Splat! [ giggles ] Eubie! I'm sorry, Kelly. Now, what's the rest of your show-and-tell gonna be? I'm going to-- Mo! Oobie mo! Eubie, your bowl is already full. Uh-hah?! Hah-ah! Ouch! Ouch! Food! Food! I don't care what you say, mister, I'm not letting you put that filthy hamster in your mouth. No, dear. He wants you to feed breakfast to Ouch. Come on, come on, now. Play along. Oh, all right-- ouch! [ laughs ] Come here, you little-- whoa-oh-oh! Ugh! Does anybody remember I was talking? Hello? "No, what were you saying, Kelly?" I said I'm going to tell the whole class about my family being space aliens. Sorry, Kelly. Now what were you saying? You're doing show-and-tell on illegal aliens? Good topic, Kell. Very controversial. Phew... [ car horn beeping ] That's my ride for school. Love you, sweetie. Have a good day, dear. Sometimes I worry that we pay too much attention to Eubie. Ha, Dada. Honey, he's too dangerous to ignore. Oh, Dad? Can you please bring me home two more boxes of Fruity-Os from work? You got it, Kell! Thank you! Speaking of cereal... I have just enough time for breakfast. [ Eubie chuckling ] [ rattling ] Ooh! Yum! Eubie, come help Mommy finish her cake. Is that tonight's dessert specialty? I'm bringing it down to Betty's Gourmet Shop. You can eat it if she turns me down. Thank you, dear. I'll take those. Mmm-wah! Good luck! I'm gonna need it! Well, gotta get to work. Have a nice day, dear. Hey, buster! This is a very important cake, so just hand over those crayons. O-kay! [ giggles ] Oh, Eubie! Oh! Yum! Oobie help Mama. More. Okay, more. More! Whoa! Not so fast there, young man. But thanks for the help. Oobie help. Wish me good luck, Eubie. Goo 'uck, Mama. Okey-dokey, then. You want a mocha java cappuccino with whipped cream and extra strawberry flavor drops, right? Would you like a shot of espresso with that? Gloria! Give me a sec. I've gotta make a 10,000-calorie latte here. Was that a large or jumbo? Raw sugar? Steamed milk? Buh-Buh! Oobie want Buh-Buh. Okay, honey, okay. You got Buh-Buh. Okay. All right, Eubie. [ classical music playing ] Buh-Buh. [ gasps ] Moozy! Moozy! Moozy! [ music continues ] [ slurps ] Moozy! Moozy! Ow-ww! Moozy! You be good now, dear. Ba-ba-ba-ba... [ squeals ] So this is one of your famous cakes. It looks good enough to bronze. [ babbling ] Whew. Mommy--! Please be still, Eubie. Oobie want moozy! Whoa! Oh, wow! Yow! Oh, dear. Oh, boy, he's a strong one. Let's sample the cake before he maims any more of my customers. [ chuckles ] [ babbles ] Ba-ba-- moozy! Moozy! Moozy, moozy! [ music blares ] [ screams ] Wha--? Eubie? [ squealing ] [ man screaming ] [ music stops ] I'm blind! The baby has blinded me with his sharp little thumbs! Aren't you sorry, Eubie? [ giggles ] Ah-hah-hah, oh-hah-ah. Oh, please! Keep the baby from hating me again, please. Oh, no, he doesn't hate you. Eubie just-- well, he really likes music. Moozy, moozy! Wolfgang, you know what you need? You need a piece of Gloria's cake. How about a piece of Gloria's cake? My stomach is in knots, but I suppose I could. Everyone, free cake sample. Mmm-- yum-yum-yum yum-yum! [ customers murmuring ] There you go. Oh, here, here you are. Oh, here, have some. [ squeals, gulps ] Eubie, are you okay? [ moaning ] I hope this is as good as it looks, because to tell you the truth, the desserts I'm serving right now are those health desserts. You know, the ones that are good for you, but taste like fruit juice-sweetened foam rubber? But this looks great. Whoa! Diss is werry, werry wemmony. The cake is shrinking my tongue! Eubie, honey, did you put extra lemon into Mommy's cake batter? Ooh-- ugh! [ gulps ] Yum! I'll come back and try again. Oh, please do! [ cooing ] Bye-bye! Bye-bye. [ customers coughing ] [ screams ] Buh-Buh! Relax, Eubie. Buh-Buh is probably in the car. [ Eubie screaming ] Buh-Buh. Oh-kay! So, who's here? Mrs. Johnson and Billy. Mr. Stevens and Brittany. Mrs. Burton and the twins! Okay, Mrs. Goode and Eubie. Our new play friends, Mrs. Rock and Lulu. Oh, no. No, I am not Mrs. Rock. I am Heidi. Au pair. Oh-kay! Mrs. Au pair and Lulu! Oh-kay! Say hello to Lulu, class. Hi, Lulu. Whoa! Ah-hh. Oobie love Woowoo. I'm Mrs. Rock. Oof--! I brought my little Lulu here because she's very bright and as a result, becomes quickly bored in unstimulating social environments. I want her properly stimulated. Here's a check. Work with me. Oh-kay! Lulu, let's take that lollipop out so we can communicate better with the other children. Wah-hh! Oh-kay, then, let's start with a free play time! Stay in groups, you guys, and remember to share. [ tweets ] [ children babbling ] Give it. Give it. [ squealing ] [ tweets ] Isn't it funny? Your husband works for my husband, and we girls never get to socialize except here. Why, yes, it's true. I mean, we-- uh, yes. Say, do you play tennis? We should play sometime. Well, I-- Well, of course you do! We'll do doubles! Gee, that would be-- It would be great, wouldn't it? [ seesaw squeaking ] [ gurgling ] [ squeals ] Ooh-- whoa! Hi... [ class bell rings ] [ squealing ] Buh-Buh... Eubie, look. Say hi to Kelly. Hi, Eubie. "Greetings, Master Eubie!" Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh-buh-buh... Buh-Buh, Buh-Buh... Has he been doing that all day? Yes. Buh-Buh... I know, Eubie, dear. We'll find your Buh-Buh. Buh-Buh... It's lost again? Buh-Buh, Buh-Buh...! Mom, can't you make him stop? No. Buh-Buh, Buh-Buh... Well, could you please try, because-- Pardon me, sweetheart? I said, could you-- hey! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Oh, just forget it. What, sweetheart? I said just-- What did you say? I said what? What?! What?! What?! I can't hear you! [ laughing ] Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh? Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! I tell you what, Eubie, when we get home, I'll help you find Buh-Buh, okay? Buh-Buh! It's the crazy baby again! Whoa! Argh! Whoa! Oof! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry! Sorry! I'm really, really sorry! I-- whoa! Hi. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. How are you? [ stammers ] Hmm. Hah! Hah! There you go. Oh! Cool. Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I've added it up twice and you're still eight dollars short. Oh, my. I'll handle this, Penny. You shop here a lot, don't you, ma'am? We have a lot of respect for our regular customers. Here you go. Four one-dollar-offs, five half-pricers, and four buy-one-get-one-frees. Now you get a dollar twenty-five change and... four extra cans of garbanzos. Thank you so much. Thank youfor shopping here. Thank you. That was, like, so nice! Goode! In my office! Now! Goode! I saw what you did with that woman at the register. How many times have I told you not to give away food? Well, technically speaking, Mr. Rock, coupons are free. So I didn't really give anything away. Yeah, I've thought about that technicality, otherwise I would've had you arrested for shoplifting. [ laughs ] [ mock laughter ] Mr. Rock, since you're in such a good mood, I'd like to talk to you about... my raise. Who gave you a raise? Well, no one yet, Mr. Rock. But I think it's about time someone did. And just why would that be? Well, I'm punctual, I'm efficient... You're nothing if not that, that's true. And the customers all love me. That they do, that they do. And, I've been Employee of the Month for three and a half years straight. Do you know how many months that is? Can't say as I do. You don't have to add it up. It's 42 months. 42. Well, you certainly make a strong case for yourself, Goode. So I tell you what I'm gonna do for you-- I am notgonna give you a raise! Why, thank you, sir-- huh? But I-I-- I don't know what to say, Mr. Rock. Say, "Thank you." Thank you?! You're welcome. You're a good manager, Goode. That's the problem. You're toogood. The only thing you're missing is the one thing that got me where I am today. Guess what that thing is, Goode? The fact that your wife's father left you the store after dying in a freak produce-related accident? Guess again. Mr. Rock, I really need this raise, otherwise I wouldn't be-- Greed, Goode! Greed! Greed, Mr. Rock? It's the only missing element in your resumé. It's the only job skill that's keeping you from being a truly great manager! Now, the way I figure it, if you go long enough without a raise, then eventually you'll get greedy. The greed, in turn, will make you a better manager, and then you'll deserve a raise! Mr. Rock, I have to be honest with you. No matter how long I go without a raise, I don't think I'll ever get greedy. I'm counting on that, Goode. Now get back to work! Ugh! Ow! Relax, Goode. The trash can's on me. Ugh! Thanks, Mr. Rock. Oh-hh! [ crashes ] Mo food! Mo, mo food! Mo food! Mo, mo, mo food! [ yelling continues ] Mo food! Mo, mo food! [ slurps, grunts ] Ugh! Yuck! [ grunts ] Seems like he's pickier than usual tonight. [ slurps, grunts ] [ loud burp ] Ugh! Mom! Dad! Eubie is making me sick! Can I just eat in front of the TV? Of course not, Kell. Dinnertime is one of the most important times we have as a family. Oh, great. Besides, don't you wanna know what special goodies Dad brought home from the market today? More stale donuts? That's "day-old bakery goods," Kell. Because, as you know-- "Nothing should go to waste. Everything has its place!" [ giggles ] I know, I know. That's right. And just for you kids... last month's leftover cereal inventory! Could be a little stale. Oh, boy! Fruity-Os! Fruity-Os! Just what I needed, Dad! I'm a hero. There! Now I have enough box bottoms for a Princess Trolla RV Playset! Yay! And for you, my dear. You brought something for me? The $1.99 Flower Special, from last Tuesday. How romantic! [ laughing ] Whee! Eubie-ee! Oh! Ah-pah! [ squeaks ] Er... is it my imagination, or is Eubie even more... "special" than usual tonight? Well, he's being pretty good, considering. Considering what? Well, he lost his... Uh...? Oobie-ay ost-lay is-ay Uh-Buh-bay. I don't get it, Kell. Are you saying that Eubie lost Buh-Buh? [ groans ] Buh-Buh-hh! Aw, no... [ Eubie screams ] Prince Eubie, will you marry Princess Trolla? Ah-hah-hah... Well, will you or will you not? Pinchess Toll! Ba-ba, Pinchess Toll! I'll take that as a yes. Princess Trolla, will you marry Lord Eubie? "Oh, I suppose so." Lord Eubie, do you agree to love Princess Trolla with all of your heart? Toll! Toll! Pinchess Toll! Pinchess Toll! Okay, then. Prince Eubie, you may now kiss the bride. Yay! [ pops ] Mmm-ah, mwah, mwah! Mom! Wah-hh! Mom! Ugh! Eubie? What have you got? Bah doo-noo. Hand over that head! [ pops, squeaks ] "Prince Eubie, you are hereby banished from my kingdom forever!" [ razzes ] Kelly-- "Banished, I tell you!" Kelly--? "Banished!" Kelly! What, Mom? It's time for bed. Bed? It's still light out. What did I do? Well, honey, we thought you might do us a big favor and go a little bit early tonight. We thought since Eubie lost... you know, his... you know-- well, that you might sleep in his room tonight. Okay, but then where's Eubie gonna sleep? Kelly, do you remember the last time Eubie lost... you know... lost it? Remember he would only sleep with you in the room? Sleep? Sleep? He never sleeps! He played peek-a-boo and he kicked me in the back all night long. Kelly, please? I'm sorry, Mom, but I-- I won't do it. Nuh-uh! No! [ snoring ] Up until now, today kind of stunk. I got shot down on my raise. I threw a whole coffeehouse into lemon shock. Then we come home to a mailbox full of bills. Add another to the list. When I pulled into the driveway tonight, something fell off the car. Gas, electric, water, phone. If my calculations are correct, we can afford any two of those four modern conveniences. Your choice, dear. Honey... "Nuts of the Month"? Who did we buy "Nuts of the Month" for? We gave it to the Rocks for Christmas. Perfect. Still it's kind of hard to be down when you look at those two. The Rocks? The kids. Gotcha. Oh, you--! [ laughing ] Shh, shh shh-shh. The way they're sleeping, we might even get a few hours of shut-eye ourselves tonight. [ squeaks ] [ squeaks ] Huh...? [ screams ] [ snoring within ] Buh-Buh... Coo-- Buh-Buh? Buh-Buh--! Mom! Mom! Eubie stole Princess Trolla's head again! How can Princess Trolla rule over her kingdom like this? How can she wear her sparkly crown? You! You promised not to do this anymore! Don't even talk to me till you cough up the head! [ coughs ] [ chuckles ] Very funny! Kelly, I promise I'll help find Princess Trolla's head. In the meantime, your ride's here. Kell, if you don't kiss him goodbye, he'll cry all morning. Find the head... or you sleep alone! [ slams ] Well, looks like we need a new teddy bear and a new Princess Trolla, huh? Buh-Buh...? Buh-Buh?! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh-hh! Wish me luck again, Eubie. Glucken again, Mama! Will you try it, or are you afraid? Of course I'm afraid. We're all afraid. You're lucky I'm a chocoholic. [ grunts ] [ grunting ] I call it my "chocolate truffle surprise." Chocolate truffle... Soo-prize! So that's where Princess Trolla's head went. Surprise is right. Not every day you see this sort of thing in a cake. Raisins, maybe. Nuts on occasion, but this, Gloria-- this is truly original. [ babbles ] Oh, I'd really appreciate it if you'd at least taste it. Just mush it up with a fork first to make sure it's safe. You don't give up, do you? Mmm...! Mmm-mm-mm-mm! What is it? Is it something sharp? Mmm! It's the best cake I've ever eaten. If I could sell this in my place, we'd both get rich. Unfortunately I can't serve desserts with a warning label. Listen, Eubie's having his second birthday party tomorrow. See, if I can fill up a whole dessert table without serving up a doll part, you can consider making me an offer. Tempted. Maybe. No way. Maybe-- okay. Noon. Saturday. My house. Don't, like, let them commercialize your work, lady. The doll head was, you know, like, an amazingtouch. Thank you. "Mr. Rock, I thought about what you said yesterday, and I agree that sometimes, in some situations, greed canbe a good thing." Hmm-- no, no. That's a lie. "Mr. Rock, I thought about what you said yesterday and... well, quite frankly, I had a dream about choking you with your tie, and--" No. Too honest. And I'm telling you that you still have a hundred pounds of frozen cod to stock. But I-- I-- ooh-- ah-choo! Melvin, do you know what frozen cod is when it isn't frozen anymore? [ gulps, shudders ] J-just c-cod, sir? Worse than that, Melvin. It's a horrible, smelly fish that no one-- except for possibly a few very disturbed individuals-- would want to buy. Now get back in that freezer or you're fired! I-I-- [ sneezes ] ...quit-choo! I quit! Oh, yeah? Well, er... I fired you first! Now, where will I ever find the equal to a stupid high school kid with no marketable job skills? Hmm, let me see... Goode? Mr. Rock, I need to talk to you. Fine. Talk to me-- from inside the freezer. You can etch your sentiments in the frost. [ laughs ] [ laughs ] But seriously, Mr. Rock. I've been thinking about what you said yesterday. Oh, you mean about keeping my trash can? I've changed my mind about that. You see, I've discovered I'm a lot less accurate putting into my coffee cup. No, I mean-- ahem-- about my raise. I think you're being unreasonable, Mr. Rock. I have two kids and a mortgage. And a car with pieces falling off of it. And you just fired my only ride to work. And I want more money, Mr. Rock! I need more money. I have to have more money! [ nervous chuckling ] Um... Good, Goode! Very, very good! You're definitely getting greedier! I think about another six months without a raise should do it. Now get moving. I'm starting to smell cod here. Ungh-hh! [ grunts ] Bernie! Bernie Rock! Hi, Midge. Hi, Lulu. Heidi. Hi, Mr. Rock. How about a big kiss from Daddy's little girl? Wah-hh! Never touch the lollipop, Bernie. You know that. Never. Is that better, sweetie? Oh, ja. Hey, I just fired you! I found him shivering in the parking lot and I gave him his job back. Wait a minute-- Can it, or I'll give him a raise, too. Hello, Cornelius, how are you? Well, speaking of a raise-- Now, Bernie, what are you doing standing around with a pile of fish bricks? We're having dinner at my mother's tonight and you're doing the cooking. Honey, as much as I love cooking for you and your mother, there's a lot of work to be done around here. Better cancel. I'm so sorry. Oh, no, yougo ahead. I'llstack the cod. Gee, thanks, Corny, but it's a special job, and I really feel I need to do it myself. Why, look, it's Gloria and little Eubie. What a nice surprise. Hi, Midge. Hello, dear. Hi, Gloria. Hi, Eubie. [ sniffing ] Pee-yew! Yuck! Eubie! He's right, Gloria. Something does smell, and it's Bernie! He stinks of cod! Yeah, Bernie really stinks today, all right. Pee-yew! Pee-yew-- oh-hh! Oh-hh...! [ babbles ] Pinchess Tolla! Would you look at that, they love each other! Eubie even invited Lulu to his birthday party on Saturday, didn't he, Lulu? Wait a minute, I'm playing golf on Saturday-- We're going to the party, and that's that. By the way, Gloria, have you seen my new convertible? Why, no. I haven't. [ rattles ] Oh, but I'd love to. Come on. I'll take you and Corny for a ride while Bernie finishes with his fish. Heidi, you watch the kids. And no boys, okay? Ja,okay. Of course, uh-huh, no. All right, who wants to volunteer for duty? [ giggles ] Ja... [ sucking ] Oh... Bah...? Ah...! Ta-da! Ah! Ah! [ grunts ] Oh--! Whoa! [ giggles ] [ giggles ] Uh...? [ engine starts ] [ babbles ] Just listen to that baby purr. Well, it sure sounds a lot better than our ca-- argh! [ tires screeching ] [ grunts ] [ chuckles ] [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ engine revs, screeching ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ tires squeal ] [ yells ] [ screaming ] [ horns honking ] [ screaming ] [ giggles ] Oh... ah! [ babbles ] [ giggles ] What did I tell ya? It almost drives itself! Uh-huh...! [ babbles ] [ giggles ] [ Lulu giggles ] Heh! [ woman humming ] Wha...? What do you know? Caviar's on sale for... for 99 cents?! [ Lulu yelping ] Steak is 99 cents, too! Everything in the store is on sale for 99 cents! Edna, you'll never believe this-- ShopWell is having a 99-cent sale. Yeah! Bring the pickup! [ shoppers chattering ] [ truck horn honks ] [ screaming ] It's got all the extras, including a state-of-the-art stereo system. It's so fancy that I haven't even figured out how to adjust the stations yet. [ squeaking ] [ music blares ] [ tires screeching ] [ Eubie grunting ] Hah...? [ classical music plays ] Oh, boy... Buh-Buh! Wha...? [ panting ] Yaggh-hh! Ba, Buh-Buh! [ screaming ] Buh-Buh, Buh-Buh! [ tires screeching ] [ chuckles ] How's that for handling? Great--! [ Wolfgang yelling ] Buh-Buh-hh! [ tires screeching ] Hey-yy! You're supposed to accelerate into the turns, you know. [ panting ] [ panting ] [ yelling ] [ engine roars ] Whoo! I could never have made this light in my old car! [ yelping ] [ Eubie screeching ] [ Midge chuckling ] I don't understand it. 35 years in the business and now I'm stocking cod. [ yelping ] [ yells ] What's going on around here? Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Ow! Hey, this door is locked! Somebody get me out of here! Hey! Hey, you, I'm stuck in here! [ chattering ] Whoa-aa! [ grunting ] [ giggling ] Ah...?! Here you go. Have a nice day. [ panting ] [ tires screeching ] [ humming ] Buh-Buh! [ tires screeching ] Huh? Well, what do you think? [ moaning ] Buh-Buh! Oh-- Buh-Buh...! My, the store seems to be doing a bang-up business today. People sure are stocking up. I wonder if we're expecting a natural disaster. We're having a 99-cent sale! Oh. What?! No! No, we're not! [ gasps ] [ Eubie screaming ] Now, if I don't get some help in here soon... Oh, no... it's going to get very, very unpleasant. [ bangs ] I've been patient with you people so far, but I'm losing control. Now, somebody get in here and get me out of this thing! I mean it! This minute! Mr. Rock? Goode?! Goode?! [ growls ] [ gulps ] [ voices chattering ] Parents? Parents? Eyes up here. Ahem. Thank you. Thank you all again for visiting our classroom tonight. Now, before you go, we have a special Parents' Night treat. Oh, I know how much each of you parents love your children. [ razzing ] Uh, yes. And so tonight, on Parents' Night, the children are going to share with you, their families, how much they loveyou. [ applause ] Okay-- um... I love my mom and my dad, um, and I love my little brother, Buddy-- even though I think he gave me his head lice. [ applause ] I love my mom, and I love my dad, and I love my little sister Cathy, but most of all, I love me! I love me because I'm pretty, and because I'm smart, and because-- did I say I was pretty yet? [ giggles ] [ applause ] [ coughs ] Okay, uh... what was it, what was it? Oh, yeah, um... [ sniffles ] Um... [ gulps ] Thank you, Victor. [ applause ] Oh...! And our last student to speak tonight will be Kelly Goode. [ applause ] Oh, doesn't she look great? She is so cute! Ah-- Kell-Kelly! Shh. Ahem. "My Family, by Kelly Goode." Ahem. "My mom is real beautiful, just like a queen. But she does so much stuff, she works like a machine. She cleans and she washes, she sews and she bakes. My mom makes the world's bestest cookies and cakes. She's a chauf and a-- she's a chef and a chauffeur, a teacher, a pal. My best friend and playmate and one heck of a gal!" Oh-hh... "My dad is a hero. He works every day. And he runs in a rat race, but he still likes to play. He's smart, and you listen when mydad has spoken. And he knows how to fix all our stuff when it's broken. My dad is so strong, and he's real brave, of course. But mostly, I love him 'cause he's a good horse! But my brother, he's different from Mom and from Dad, 'cause he's just a baby, and sometimes he's bad." Ah... Buh-Buh! "To have me a brother, I'm supposed to feel lucky. But I think he's noisy and slimy and yucky." [ screams ] "When he breaks all my toys, I say bad things about him. But he's my brother Eubie, and I can't live without him!" Oh-hh! [ applause ] Thank you very much! Tank oo. Tank oo buss. [ music playing within ] Fries. Can I have some ketchup? Kelly, that was the nicest speech I've ever heard. You were great, Kelly. Thanks, Dad. Welcome to Happy Boy. Now, what do you want? Hmm. What exactly is a "Happy Boy Pizza Surprise"? Ya take a regular pizza and you make a big Happy Boy face on it outta tomatoes, and presto-- you got your Happy Boy Pizza Surprise. You want that? Ooh, that sounds like fun. We'll take a large one of those and four milks, please. Ah! Cheezie, cheezie! Oh, you're right, Eubie. Could you put extra cheese on that Happy Boy Pizza Surprise? Sorry, no substitutions. But we-- So that'll be it? Okay. May we have some more napkins? What am I, your mother? On the table next to you there. Help yourself. You sure made us proud up there, didn't she, Eubie? Uh-huh! [ clapping, giggling ] Thanks, Eubie. Here ya go. Already? Gee... thanks. [ babbles ] Cheezie pee-zah! Could we have some more silverware, please? My shift's over. Here's your check. [ giggling ] Honey, where's Eubie? Oh, no! Eubie? Eubie? [ giggling ] Eubie? Eubie? Mustie! No, no, no, no, Eubie! Whatever you do, don't squeeze. [ squeals ] Mustie! [ giggles ] Thanks for eating at Happy Boy. [ laughing ] Oh, Eubie! [ crickets chirping ] Good night, you two. Good night. Night-night! "I bid you good night, Kelly's parents." Don't worry, Eubie. Tomorrow's your birthday, and I have a funny feeling we're gonna find Buh-Buh. Get some sleep now, Eubie. Big day tomorrow, birthday boy. [ dog barking ] [ snoring within ] [ yawns ] 'Ake up! Oobie up! Hah! [ babbling ] Mama...? [ giggling ] Oh--! Oh--! Oh! Ow-side. Oobie ow-side. Oo-ooh? Wha--? Huh? Uh-oh! Wha--? Oh! [ giggles ] Ah... [ giggles ] 'Appy Oobie Day! [ giggles ] [ toots ] [ screams ] Happy Oobie Day! Happy birthday, sweetheart. Yes, but it's a little early to-- [ tooting ] Oh! [ giggling ] Eubie? Eubie? Come back here! [ Eubie giggles ] [ loud tooting ] I hope this is another nightmare. Let's see. Ow! Hey! Nope. It's not. It's 9:00. We have exactly three hours. It's impossible. Not if we really, really hurry. I think we can do it. "I agree, Kelly's parents!" [ gurgling ] [ giggles ] [ gurgling ] Come on, Eubie. We only have two hours and 36 minutes until your party. [ giggles ] [ babbles ] [ squeals, giggles ] Eubie? Eubie? Come on, Eubie, no kidding around here. Eubie? Whee! Corny? Can you watch him for a little while longer? I can watch him, I just can't catch him! [ squeals, giggles ] Ha! I've got you now! Huh! Oomph! Honey, look out, the basement door is open-- Whoa-aa! [ thumps, crashing ] I'm okay! [ crashing ] [ moans ] Aw, Eubie... Kell, how many balloons do you have there? I don't know. I can only count to 20. Kell, I think that'll be enough. Why don't you help me hang the piñata? I can't believe you got a rat piñata! The guy at the store swore to me that this was a bear. I wanted a bear-- you know, like Buh-Buh. Whoa! The yard looks great. [ squeals, giggles ] Happy Oobie Day! [ giggling ] I think he likes the decorations. Corny, what's with the rat piñata? Dad thinks it's a bear. Honey, it has beady eyes and a pink tail. It's a bear. It's a bear. Now can we focus on the positive here? [ giggles ] Eubie loves it, right, Eubie? [ babbles ] See? [ laughs ] [ babbles ] I wonder what he's saying. I don't know, but for the first time in two days, he seems to have forgotten about... Buh-Buh. [ rope creaking ] [ softly ] Oh, Buh-Buh...! Oh, Buh-Buh... [ ticking ] Presents wrapped, cakes and cupcakes baking. Decorations secure. Plastic bats collected. Huh? Plastic bats-- so the kids can beat the rat. The bear. Check. Good thinking. So, everything's set. Oh-- What is it, dear? Where's Eubie? Foo-prize! [ giggling ] Oh! My desserts! What did you say, Eubie? Foo-prize! [ sizzling ] Kelly, where's Princess Trolla's head? "On my royal shoulders, thank you." Then whose head is this? "It is my best friend, Lifeguard Tiffany!" Foo-prize! [ giggling ] It's Surgeon Cindy, M.D.! Foo-prize! Eubie, did you put anything else in Mommy's desserts, sweetheart? Ah--! Uh-huh! [ giggling ] Did you put the things in the cake that's in the oven? Ah-hah! Or in one of the seven trays of cupcakes and pies? Uh... foo-prize. Well, the show must go on. I'll set the snacks out. Corny, you get into your birthday costume! Wait a minute. You said I'd never have to do that again. Please? For Eubie? Mmm-wah! Aw, honey... So is my boy all ready for his party? Look, Eubie! Look who it is. I look like a moron. Do the dance. He likes the dance. All right. [ sighs ] Huh. He liked it last year. They're here! I'll get it! [ kids squealing ] Nice to see you, Mr. and Mrs. Rock. Heidi. Lulu. Hey, whaddya know? Look at this, Midge-- a talking doormat. [ chuckles ] Corny, is that you? Oh, look, Lulu, Eubie's father is dressed up like a silly... alligator... thing. Okay, maybe if you make the alligator noises or something, she would laugh. Ja. Sorry, all I do is dance. You'd make a better coatrack Goode, if you stood up. [ grunts ] [ mimics trumpet fanfare ] And now, kids, a little dino-tainment! [ humming ] Cha cha-cha, cha-cha! [ humming ] Cha-- oof! [ laughing ] Oh! Huh? [ sniffing ] [ screams ] Corny, your tail's on fire! Aggh! My tail's on fire! I got you covered, Goode! Whoa-aa! I'm coming, Goode! Whew! It's okay, Mr. Rock, the fire's... ...out. [ laughter ] [ voices overlapping ] Hokey-donkey! There you go. [ voices overlapping ] [ yowls ] Ooh! Ooh! Mmm-hmm. Oh-hh! Mmm...? [ chuckles ] Mmm...? It's piñata time! [ kids chattering ] This bear thing is called a "piñata." It looks like a rat. It's a bear! [ silence ] All right, let's just say it's a rat. Either way, it's still a piñata, and it's still full of all kinds of goodies. How do we get the goodies out? Well, that's the fun part. You beat on the rat with these bats until it breaks open and all the goodies fall out to the ground. Okay, kids! Ready? On your marks... get set... go! Here. Watch me. [ kids giggling ] Okay, come on! Swing those bats! Ow! Hey! Hey! Ow, ooh, ow, ow! Not funny anymore. Not funny! [ giggling ] Slow down here. Somebody's going to time outin a minute. I'm not kidding! Oh, no! [ grunts ] Ouch! Woowoo! Woowoo! Ouch! Ooh-- bye-bye, Ouch. Hey! Ow! Hey! Ooh! [ giggling ] So I look him right in the eye and I say-- Ouch! [ laughs ] I'll take that, dear. Thank you. [ laughs ] [ whacking ] [ kids grunting ] Lousy rat! [ grunting, panting ] [ thumping ] [ grunting, panting ] [ whirring ] [ man cheers ] Yes! No more rats in my house! [ groans ] Well, Goode, at least we tried. Stupid piñata. [ grumbling ] Let it go, Mr. Rock. Let it go, Let it go. [ grunting ] Great party, Corny. My little Lulu is having the time of her life. I'm glad. I felt really bad about what happened with her and Eubie at the store yesterday. Bad? What-- didn't-- didn't Bernie tell you? Tell me what? Bernie! You better have told him! Sure, I told him. You told me to tell him and I told him. Told me...? [ stammers ] Told me... everything. He told me the whole story. Can you believe it? Gloria, can you believe that little sale of Eubie's and Lulu's actually made the store money? No! No! I mean, no wonderit did. It's amazing. How exactly didthat work again? We sold so much volume that it didn't matter how cheap the stuff was! And your husband has another piece of good news for you, too. What, honey? Bernie?! I told him! Tell Gloria the news, Corny! What news, dear? Uh, you tell her, Mrs. Rock. I'm still too... overwhelmed. I made Bernie give your Corny a long overdue raise! Yes! I get excited no matter how many times I hear it! I couldn't believe how little this cheapskate was paying you! Me either! [ laughing ] I hope he was generous with you, Corny. Bernie, were you generous? Uh, yeah. Sure. Oh, he's going to be-- I mean, wasvery, very generous. Yep, he jacked my pay up 25% and made me district manager for the entire chain! I-I did not-- mean to wait so long to do it! Of course I'll still do all my regular jobs around the store! Otherwise, Bernie would have to work for a living. And he wouldn't want that! Come on, Gloria. I want you to give me the recipe for those chewy bear cupcakes. There were chewy bears in the cupcakes? Ahem--! Goode, that was one of the lowest, sleaziest displays I have ever witnessed. I have a whole new respect for you. And by the way, thanks for covering for me with my wife. You're okay, Goode! Don't mention it. But I'm only giving you a 20% raise. Really? But Mrs. Rock said I'd-- All right, all right! We'll stick with the 25. [ laughs ] Ecch. Time for cake and presents! Happy birthday, Eubie! Happy birthday, Eubie! Okay, Eubie, make a wish and blow out the candles. [ mutters ] ...Buh-Buh! [ laughter ] Yeah-yeah-yeah! Huh? What do you say, Eubie? Uh--? No Buh-Buh? Ecch! That's his word for "thank you." [ babbling ] What do you say? Uh-- no Buh-Buh! [ screams ] He loves it. [ babbling ] Huh...? Turn the handle, Eubie. See what's inside. [ music tinkles ] [ Eubie screams ] Where Buh-Buh? Happy birthday, Eubie. [ babbles ] That's not what I think it is...? I had to go to 20 stores to find it. It's the same model as the original. He'll never fall for it. Sure, he will. Watch. Buh-Buh?! How--? I ran it through the spin cycle a few times, then I pulled out one of the eyes. Pretty smart, eh? Uh, Buh-Buh? Oh, boy. I hope I pulled out the right eye. No, I think it was the left eye. [ whines ] No Buh-Buh. Buh-Buh no! Aw-ww... Sorry, buddy. [ sobs ] Sorry, Eubie. Gloria...? Betty? Where are you? Over here. Betty, are you okay? I tested every single dessert. I feel like I ate a moose. You found a moose in the cupcakes? [ chuckles ] On the Betty Scale, you get a 10 for flavor, a 10 for presentation, and a five for the car keys I pulled out of the cherry pie. Well, at least I tried. And, you showed improvement. Maybe next time, huh? Oh, forget next time. I've decided to hire you anyway. You're kidding! I have to. You have a gift, Gloria-- a gift that's too profound to share only with your family. The way you bake, you should be out making the whole world fat. For starters, I want as many of those birthday cakes as you can make. The coffee grounds were a great touch. Coffee grounds? Coffee grounds? Eubie? Eubie?! Eubie?! Oh, Buh-Buh, me... [ gasps ] Ah! [ gasps ] Buh-Buh? Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! [ giggling ] Eubie? Eubie? Eubie? Eu-bie! Lulu, dear, how did you get so messy? Ah, Woowoo! Woowoo! What was that? Woowoo! [ chuckles ] Oh, it's just Eubie, floating away on some balloons. Floating away on balloons?! Argh! Bernie! Bye-bye! Eubie! Wow, I hope I get balloons at my next birthday party! Mom! I told you, he was floating! Eubie was floating! Of course he was, dearest. Did he have wings or a propeller? Mom, can I have balloons like Eubie's at my next birthday party? Eubie? Eubie! Eubie! Gloria, I can't find Eubie. I've looked everywhere. Oh, yeah? Well, did you look up? Oh, no! My baby! Eubie?! All right, honey. Don't worry. We can spot him from below. Let's go! Everybody in the car! Bernie and I'll help. Heidi! Get your clogs over here and watch Lulu! Oh, ja,of course. Uh-huh! Hurry, honey. Come on, Gloria. All right, guys. This way. [ sputters ] [ crashes ] How about my car? Great idea! Hop in! Honey, are you sure you wanna-- whoa-aa! Follow that baby! Seat belt! Seat belt! Seat belt! [ babbling ] [ giggling ] Buh-Buh... Buh-Buh?! Ah-- Buh-Buh...! Hey! Hey! [ gasps ] [ pops ] Way-- whoa! Are we dead yet? Oh, don't be a wimp, Bernie! Gloria has this well in hand. [ truck horn blares ] [ horn blares ] Hold on! There he is! He's headed to the park! Buh-Buh? Buh-Buh! [ gasps ] Oh--! [ giggling ] Whoa-aa! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! He was going this way! No, no, a little over that way! No, wait, no-- this way-- no, wait, wait a minute. [ rustling ] [ riders screaming ] Sorry! [ violins tuning ] Buh-Buh...? Buh-Buh! [ giggling ] Ahem. [ tapping ] Be quiet. Shh-shh. [ music plays ] [ humming ] [ Eubie babbling ] Eh? Wha-aa? [ screams ] It's the crazy baby! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh! Buh-Buh!
