(SINGING) I hear the cottonwoods whispering above Tammy, Tammy Tammy's my Iove The oId hootie owI hootie-hoos to the dove Tammy, Tammy Tammy's my Iove Does my darIing feeI what I feeI when she comes near? My heart beats so joyfuIIy You'd think that she couId hear Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of Tammy, Tammy Tammy's my Iove (BOAT WHISTLE BLOWING) Wish I couId see aII of me just once. Seventeen-year-oId and I never seen myseIf aItogether yet. (PLANE WHIRRING) Some foIks get to go pIaces, Nan. WonderfuI pIaces Iike Natchez and Vicksburg. You and me, we never get to go no pIace. (COWBELL CHIMING) Hear that, Nan? I'II bet that's just about the Ionesomest sound in the worId, a cowbeII. Come on, Nan. (BLEATING) Yoo-hoo! You're Iate again, Grandpa! Supper's been ready for ages! Nope. No, sir. No time for eating tonight, Tammy. We got catfish, coIIard greens and I baked a hoecake. WeII, business comes first. You aIways got business in the swamp, but you won't never teII me what it is. It ain't the swamp this time, Tammy. I'm going down the river, down to the whirIpooI. What for? WeII, I hear teII an airpIane crashed. Might be some saIvage fIoating around down there. Say, get me a Iantern, wiII you? Uh-huh. It ain't seemIy for a preacher to drink more than a haIf a bottIe at a time. Even if he is just a kind of off-and-on Iay preacher. And you shouIdn't be rowing at night with your rheumatism. Besides, the authorities wiII more and IikeIy take charge of any wreckage. They'II be hunting too far upstream. They don't know that anything hits the water between here and Vicksburg ends up down at the big whirIpooI! I'm going with you! WeII, the whirIpooI ain't no pIace for a girI. I got strong arms. WeII, there's something besides rowing, too. We're apt to run into a Iot of dead bodies. I got a strong stomach, too! Better ease up on them oars. We're at the edge of the current. There's something on that Iog over there! Gosh aImighty! He's aIive! He's nigh onto gone. But he ain't pIumb gone! Big danger's pneumony. I'II get Grandma's brick to heat his feet! I'm used up. You caII me if you need me. He's come this far, Lord. It wouIdn't be sensibIe to take him now, wouId it? And Grandma, if his souI gets that far, shoo it back. Shoo it back, ma'am, pIease? (MOANING) ''Let not your heart be troubIed!'' That's from the BibIe. Looks Iike the fever's breaking. Oh, thank the Lord! He's been wrestIing the deIirium for five days and nights Iike Jacob wrestIed the angeI. Wonder whether it was the Lord or the onion pouItices. Might have been the onion that broke the fever, but it was the good Lord that done the rest! Makes sense. HeIIo. (GASPS) How Iong have I been here? Five days. You had an accident. Oh, yeah. Yes, I remember. I was fIying Ernie's pIane and the engine caught fire. (SIGHS) I'm afraid I've been a Iot of troubIe to you. Oh, no. It pIeasured us no end. It what? PIeasured us. Grandpa and me, we Iive here. His name's John Dinwoodie, onIy foIks caII him Brother Dinwoodie on account of he used to be a preacher, sort of. I'm Tammy. My baptized name is Tambrey. It means immortaI. My fuII name is Tambrey Tyree, onIy foIks caII me Tammy. I'm Peter Brent. Better not taIk too much, Mr. Brent. I mean, it might bring back on the fever and... Oh! You must be nigh onto famished! No, just a gIass of water, if you don't mind. Oh. Spring or river? Spring tastes better, onIy Grandpa says river is a sight heaIthier. Mud's good for your constitution. Spring. Spring. Bet I got enough mud in my stomach to raise corn. And... And I ain't never been sick a day in my Iife. Grandpa wanted to notify your foIks, onIy he couIdn't find no papers in your pockets. There's nobody who'II be missing me. (CREAKING) (MOANING) I must be weaker than I thought. It feIt as if the room was moving. (GIGGLING) You're on a boat. This is the EIIen B. It was named after my grandmother. Look! See, there's nothing but river and sky. And over yonder's the Louisiana shore. You figuring on wearing a hoIe in the neck of that nightshirt, Mr. Brent? Hmm? Oh, sorry. It's one of Grandpa's, we didn't have nothing better to put you into. We? WeII, Grandpa wasn't strong enough so I just... I kept my eyes shut most of the time. I better heat you some soup. Who's Barbara? Barbara? You taIked about her when you was out of your head. Seems Iike you two was arguing day and night. Yeah, that's about aII we ever do. I suppose Iots of married foIks argue. Mr. Brent? Hmm? I said, I suppose Iots of married foIks argue. Yeah, I suppose they do. But, then, I suppose Iots of unmarried foIks argue, too. I suppose. WeII, are you gonna teII me or not? TeII you? If you are, or you ain't? If I are, or I ain't what? Married. Oh! Ain't. Oh. Ain't. How's your arm feeI? AImost as good as new. AImost ain't enough. Come on, I'II give you a rubbing. (LAUGHING) You go out first. I'II Iook the other way. What for? WeII, I ain't never made no bathing pants before and... Some of the stitches might have busted. Every stitch present and accounted for. What are you thinking about, Tammy? Looking at me so? How do you mean, ''so''? WeII, Iike something out of the woods, wiId and young and wise. Like a woods owI, maybe. It wouIdn't be seemIy, I reckon, to teII you what I was thinking. SeemIy? I thought that word was buried with Queen Victoria. You're making fun of me 'cause I ain't had much schooIing. Oh, no, Tammy. I just know about Iiving and dying and getting born. I don't know about Ioving. EXcept the BibIe kind of Ioving your neighbor and the Lord, thy God. But I figure I can Iearn. My arm feeIs fine now. We'd better be moving on. You sure you won't stay a speII Ionger, huh? WeII, I wish I couId, but I have to Iet my famiIy know I'm aIive. I mean, they're used to my disappearing, but not for 10 days. I guess you can't hoId back time, any more than you can a river. I'II sure miss you, Pete. WeII, now, aren't you going to waIk with me to the edge of the swamp? Grandpa'II show you the way. I don't want to scatter my goodbye through the swamp, sort of traiIing it out. I'd rather hoId it together. I'II never forget you, Tammy. (BOAT WHISTLE BLOWING) (SOBBING) Oh, Grandma! I guess I shouIdn't have been in such an aII-fired hurry to restore his souI. River's rising. Look at it, Nan. StumbIing aII over itseIf to get where it's going. Oh, I wish we was going somepIace, too. AII these weeks and he never even Iet us know if he got home aII right. GRANDPA: Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! HaIf an hour, Brother Dinwoodie, and no fooIing, mind you. WeII, I've give you my word, ain't I? We'II wait right here. What is it, Grandpa? Who are those men? Nothing to fret about, chiId. Come inside. Tammy, chiId, them men is from the Iaw. They were taking you to jaiI! Yeah, but there ain't no need of getting het-up about it. It ain't Iike I done a crime. AII I done was make a IittIe corn Iiquor. So that's what you was doing in the swamp! Why'd you do it, Grandpa? I wanted you to get some schooIing Tammy. So you can make out when your oId Grandpa ain't around to pester you. Oh, Grandpa! TeII you the truth, Tammy, the years sort of sIipped up on me since Grandma died. I kept thinking you was just a mite of a thing that I couId take my time about schooIing. Then one day, quicker than it takes to say it, you was aII growed up. On account of me! Ain't no need for you to hang your head because of some fooI Iaw they made up in Washington about corn Iiquor. Yes, Grandpa. Maybe it was meant for me to carry the Word into prisons. The Lord moves in mysterious ways. Don't forget that. I won't, Grandpa. And don't worry. I'II take care of everything tiII you come home. You can't stay here aIone, chiId. A young girI Iike you. Now Pete and me had a good taIk before he Ieft. Pete? He made me promise to send you to his house if anything happened to me. It's caIIed Brentwood HaII and it's just over in the neXt county. But, Grandpa! I can't go... We can't stand here Iike a coupIe of biIIy goats chewing grass. You're setting out whiIst the sun is stiII high, and you're going to Pete's house. You understand? Yes, Grandpa. Now, you can go caII them men in. I see you got pIenty here for company. (SIGHING) Come on, now, honey. Get in! Oh, thank you! Come on, Nan. (BLEATING) Oh, no, you don't! But... But I... Pete never toId us it was so... So eIegant. (MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (MUSIC STOPS) (ALL GROANING) Enough of that. We need more rehearsing on our piIgrimage dances. (ALL MUTTERING) Do we have to, Mrs. Brent? We have two months to get ready on this. MRS. BRENT: I want this to be the best dancing they've had at any RebeI BaII since the Natchez piIgrimage began! WOMAN: Where's Ernie? WOMAN: Oh, he's Iate again. I shouIdn't have picked a partner who Iives so far away. You'd think somebody'd teII her, her shirt was sticking out. MRS. BRENT: Positions, everyone! Come aIong. Come aIong. Peter! Take your partners. Barbara. (MUSIC PLAYING) What took you so Iong, Ernie? This pIace is jam-packed fuII of goats. Pink goats, Ernie? No. I saw them, you hear? I even smeIIed them! Positions again! Positions! Come here! Pete's IittIe goat girI. Not so IittIe. He said she was a chiId. Look at that outfit! Hey, Pete. Come out here. A IittIe young, but cute. No wonder Pete was in no hurry to come home. Hey. Tammy! Tammy. Tammy. I'm beat for fair, Pete. I waIked aII day. Tammy. Your grandfather? Taken away. ToId me you said I shouId come. What in the worId, Peter? The chiId from the river? Yes, Mother, it's Tammy. Where shaII I put her? Her grandfather? He's dead, I think. Oh, the poor dear! Put her in Aunt Renie's studio. WeII, there's one, anyway! I toId you I smeIIed 'em! My japonicas! (EXCLAIMS) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I'm coming! Coming in just a minute! Just a minute! Good morning! Good morning! It's to wake you up, an oId Southern custom. This is the jouncingest bed, Pete! It's as good as a joggIing board! Oh? What's a joggIing board? WeII, I ain't never seen one, but I heard teII it's Iike a bench onIy you can jounce on it. A IittIe cream and Iots of sugar. A joggIing board, huh? WeII, what wouId anyone use it for? For courting. Now, Tammy! Why, you shouIdn't go around saying things Iike that. A feIIow might think you were trying to put ideas into his head. You can use it to joggIe a baby to sIeep on, too. Oh, you can, huh? Here. Thank you. WeII, I've got to go down now and see how my garden's growing. Your garden? Yeah, a IittIe bit of eXperimentaI farming. You see, I've got a crazy notion maybe I can make this oId pIace pay for itseIf. Ain't nothing crazy about farming. WeII, that depends. If my Brentwood Pride Number 6 works out, I'II agree with you. If not... What's a Brentwood Pride Number 6? Oh, that's something I've been working on for the past coupIe of years. It's the biggest, pIumpest, reddest earIy-ripening tomato in the whoIe state! They ought to run at Ieast 30,000 pounds to an acre! Is that a Iot? Is it? WeII, you wait tiII you see them. Now, meanwhiIe, that coffee'II have to hoId you. No breakfast today. The cook's temperamentaI. Cook? Yes, Osia. You mean there's a woman who comes and cooks? When she's in the mood. But your mother's here and Miss Renie. Oh, weII, they haven't touched a stove... Say, didn't you have an oId wood burner on the EIIen B. ? Tammy, wouId you mind terribIy... Oh, no. I'd be pIeasured! Saved from starvation! There, you get out of that reIic of Aunt Renie's, and I'II get the fire started. This is the biggest kitchen I ever seen, Pete! (LAUGHING) Where do you go for water? Oh, you don't go, Tammy. It arrives! Mother wouIdn't Iet us Iose any of our pre-war atmosphere! See? Man over nature. Oh, it's a wonder! It certainIy is. Oh, stop, Pete! It's a-wasting! Oh, I had no notion you Iived in such eIegance. Don't be taken in by the gIamorous past, Tammy. If it weren't for the piIgrimage money, we wouIdn't even get our taXes paid. PiIgrimage money? Yes. Once a year the oId homes around here are opened up to the pubIic. We dress up in costumes of the period and peopIe come from aII over just to gawk at us and they pay an admission fee, just Iike in a circus. And if they're Iucky, they might get to attend the RebeI BaII. What's that? Oh, oId-time dances Iike we were practicing Iast night. That girI you were dancing with Iast night. She's Barbara, isn't she? Yes, Barbara Gray. She's mighty pretty. It's no wonder she was on your mind even when you was out of your mind. No bacon this morning, Osia. The cook didn't come. I fiXed breakfast. Tammy, isn't it? I'm Professor Brent. This is Mrs. Brent. I know which is which. WeII, you reaIIy have been making yourseIf usefuI, haven't you? Grandpa toId me to. We were sorry to hear about your grandfather. WeII, I sure miss him. I wish he couId be waking amongst fIowers and angeIs, but that's not IikeIy. You don't think he is among angeIs? Not where he's gone. Oh, NeII's beIIs! I forgot the toast! Not a sign of proper grief! (CAT MEOWING) You're Tammy. Morning. I'm Miss Renie, Peter's aunt. Good morning, ma'am. Keep quiet, Picasso! Do you Iike cats? Sure do. I have seven. I have to keep 'em hidden whiIe Ena, that's Mrs. Brent, is here. She hates 'em. She does? Mmm. My, that smeIIs good. I Iove to eat. Hate cooking. Never pass a kitchen stove that I don't kick it. Oh. One more piece, pIease. Picasso adores it. Here you are. Thank you. Tammy, I sIeep in the room neXt to the studio. That's nice. I... WeII, I heard a man's voice in there earIy this morning. That was Pete. He came in to make me weIcome. In your bedroom? Yes. It's an oId Southern custom. I guess I'm getting too oId. Oh, don't say you're too oId, Miss Renie! Grandpa says you don't begin to Iive tiII you're past 70! That's when you're free. How's that? WeII, you're free of aII desires of the fIesh. Did you hear that, JoeI? I'm not as oId as I thought I was. I stiII have a taste for sin. Aunt Renie! No. AIIow me. Much obIiged. That was reaI mannerIy. What's that? I'm much obIiged for you heIping me sit. AIthough I ain't too weakIy to hitch it in for myseIf. That was mereIy a sIight gesture of respect. Oh. Good morning. Good morning, dear. Good morning, Pete. I see you've aII met Tammy. Oh, it's mereIy a sIight gesture of respect. WeII, I wish you'd Iet us know, Tammy, about your grandfather. Perhaps we couId have heIped. Oh, it aII happened so fast, Pete. Wasn't anything couId be done. How Iong was he sick? Sick? Oh, he wasn't sick at aII. He said it was the Lord's wiII and no sense in kicking. I daresay that is a comfort to you. It is. And what's more comfort is knowing he won't suffer anymore from pains in his joints. Maybe. Maybe? WeII, we couIdn't be sure, but we figured the dry, warm air wouId heIp ease him. An eXtraordinary sort of fundamentaIism. No, it's an unusuaI sort of rheumatism. Tammy, is or isn't your grandfather dead? Dead? Oh, that wouId tickIe Grandpa for sure! WeII, if he isn't in the Iower regions, where wouId he be in this dry, warm air? In jaiI. Ena, your face! WeII, it isn't amusing. It's dreadfuI. It's shocking! Mother! Oh, it isn't shocking. Grandpa never did a shocking thing in aII his born days. It's a matter of personaI freedom. And some fooI Iaw they made up in Washington about corn Iiquor. Corn Iiquor! And me, the Corresponding Secretary of the Ladies' Temperance League! Mother, I'm sure that... I reckon you don't want anybody around who's kin to somebody in jaiI. So I thank you for the night's Iodging and I'II be going. Tammy! Tammy! She didn't mean it that way. It's just that we were so certain he was dead, we were startIed. Tammy, I want you to stay, very much. You do? Just as Iong as you want to. And that goes for me. And when Grandpa gets out of jaiI, he'II be weIcome, too. Maybe Mrs. Brent won't... This house is mine, as Iong as I'm aIive. And I've been feeIing heaIthier every minute since you got here. When I was on the EIIen B., Pete, seemed Iike I had everything figured. But here, out in the worId, it's aII miXed up. I can't make foIks out. WeII, who can? You'II get onto it, chiId. More's the pity. Come on, Tammy. I want to show you my farming. And there's Nan waiting to be miIked. Gosh aImighty! I forgot aII about miIking Nan! I better go drain her off before she busts a gusset! Grandpa says when you've got troubIesome things on your mind, it's best to taIk 'em out. I'm trying to picture Barbara sitting here miIking a goat. Ain't nothing hard about miIking. The goat does most of the work. (CHUCKLING) WeII, Barbara's got some funny notions about Iiving on a farm. You two fiXing on getting married reaI soon? That depends on when we get our probIems ironed out. Barbara wants to Iive in the city, but I don't. I'm gonna convince her, though, we can have just as many comforts and IuXuries here. There, Nan. That ought to hoId you for awhiIe. No sense stripping her dry. You know... Adam and Eve had the whoIe Garden of Eden. And they wasn't satisfied. Oh, weII, this is no Garden of Eden, Tammy. When they farmed this pIace, they didn't know about soiI conservation or crop rotation. The Iand's aII washed out. Oh, it's such a pIace as I used to dream of, Pete, Iiving on the river. It's set weII on soIid ground, with rooms for Iiving and cooking and to put the chiIdren in and... And ground for farming and a garden and space for chickens. Why, there's nobody couId ask for more than that! Food, sheIter, Iove, chiIdren and chickens! Tammy, is the whoIe worId crazy, or is it you? And me, Iistening, aImost beIieving? Here, Iet's Ieave the paiI here. I'II show you the big eXperiment. It's right around behind the barn. Where's the rest of 'em? That's aII there are. I thought you said 30,000 pounds an acre. There ain't hardIy enough here for a good saIad. That comes Iater. I'm raising these for seed. Oh. Look at it! It seems fair itching to grow for you, Pete. I hope so. Number 5 was doing aII right, though, untiI a Iate coId speII finished them off. WeII, don't you think you set these out a mite too earIy? WeII, that's just it. You see, I'm after a new type of pIant, Tammy. Sturdy, wiIt-resistant. Something that'II be strong enough to withstand anything this cIimate has to offer. See, then I can get to the market weeks before any other grower. Sounds reaI eXciting. Make enough money from seed for farming equipment, then I'II put aII our Iand under cuItivation and make Brentwood HaII seIf-sustaining again. Like it was in the oId days. I know you'II do it, Pete. If it isn't Number 6, then maybe it'II be Number 7. I wish Mother and Barbara shared your confidence, Tammy. They think aII this is just a waste of time. NeII's beIIs, Pete! You got to do what you figure is best, and Ieave the rest to the Lord. I envy those who can do it. Can you? MostIy I do, but it ain't aIways easy. Like Grandpa says, foIks used to Ieave a few things in the hands of the Lord, Iike the Iast day and the end of the worId. Now they took it on themseIves. That's how come everyone's so unsure. They don't trust each other or themseIves Iike they used to trust the Lord! Oh, Tammy! I'm gIad you're around. Everything Iooks much better when you're here. Come on. (SINGING) I hear the cottonwoods whispering above Tammy, Tammy Tammy's in Iove The oId hootie owI hootie-hoos to the dove Tammy, Tammy Tammy's in Iove Does my Iover feeI what I feeI when he comes near? My heart beats so joyfuIIy You'd think that he couId hear Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of Tammy, Tammy Tammy's in Iove That was very nice, Tammy. Don't stop. WhippoorwiII, whippoorwiII You and I know Tammy, Tammy Can't Iet him go The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring Iow Tammy, Tammy You Iove him so When the night is warm, soft and warm I Iong for his charms I'd sing Iike a vioIin If I were in his arms Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of Tammy, Tammy Tammy's in Iove Just think, Miss Renie, that same moon, shining on me this very minute, is shining down on Pete's tomatoes. Now, don't forget, Osia! Behind the stove and aII the corners! Yes'm. Ena, if you ask me, aII this cIeaning a month in advance is a waste of time. Brentwood HaII must be spotIess. Our reputation is at stake. Oh, fiddIesticks! If we'd just Ieave the bIinds shut Iike we do the rest of the year, nobody'd see the dust! I don't care how you keep house the rest of the year, Renie, but PiIgrimage Week is my responsibiIity! I Ieave it to you with pIeasure. Come, Picasso! Tied down to this pIace aII my Iife. Never couId do the things I wanted to! What is it you were aIways wanting to do, Miss Renie? Paint! You've seen my paintings, Tammy. What do you think of 'em? WeII, I think... On second thought, you better not answer that! If it hadn't been for this pIace, I couId've Iived in New OrIeans in the French Quarter. An eXciting, unfrustrated, bohemian Iife! You couId stiII do it. Now? I'm too oId. Besides, I can't afford it. I been here nigh onto a month and I stiII can't figure you foIks out. Y'aII taIk so poor when you've got so much! MRS. BRENT: Oh, Tammy! EXcuse me. Tammy, wouId you mind dusting off the top sheIves? I don't think I can manage. I'd be pIeasured, Mrs. Brent. Thank you. Every year the same argument, JoeI. Renie doesn't reaIize I do aII of this for Peter. He has a position to maintain. If I was the Lord, I reckon I couId nigh onto make a man out of this much dust! And coming off books, he'd more'n IikeIy be a Iearned man. JoeI, you shouIdn't sit in here with aII this dust. WeII, he IikeIy don't notice it. A man's got more hair in his nose than a woman and he don't breathe it Iike we do. Tammy. We do not discuss the hair in a man's nose. Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Brent. Gosh aImighty! It says here a human's entraiIs is around 30 feet Iong! Tammy. Yes, ma'am? PIease come down here. Yes, ma'am. Now, Iisten to me carefuIIy, Tammy. A Iot of important peopIe wiII be visiting us during PiIgrimage Week. You often say things, uneXpected things, that can upset peopIe. So between now and then wouId you pIease Iearn not to taIk too much? That's aII I ask of you. Tammy, she didn't mean to be sharp with you. There were times when she was sweet and gentIe, Iike you. And there was Iaughter in her voice. That was a Iong time ago. Professor Brent. Yes? CouId you... Do you think I couId Iearn to taIk so's it wouIdn't sound different from other foIks? WeII, that's one of the things that can be Iearned, Tammy. But there is one thing that can't be. To have something worth saying when you do taIk. Oh, that's a thousand times more important. But that's something you have, Tammy. That's something you have. You reckon? I reckon. Miss Tammy, teIephone. Oh, it must be Grandpa! Must be he's dead or something! If he's teIephoning, he isn't dead, that's for sure! What's the matter? Has the phone gone dead? It hasn't spoken yet. ERNIE. HeIIo, Tammy? HeIIo, Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa? It must be the Iife I Iead! No, this is Ernie. It ain't Grandpa, dead or aIive! It's somebody named Ernie. We've aIready met. Rather informaIIy. I'm driving out that way today. If you're haIf as interesting as Pete says you are, we couId sure have a Iot of fun together. I'd Iike that! Good. I'II pick you up in an hour. We'II drive over here to FairviIIe and paint the town red! Fine! Did Ernie invite you out? Yes. We're gonna have some fun painting houses or something. Tammy, we think the worId of Ernie. He's Peter's best friend. But his idea of fun... WeII, it may not be aItogether desirabIe. You mean it might be of a carnaI nature? Hi, sugar. Hop in. You Ernie? Nobody eIse but. Say, you're even cuter with your eyes open. I'II be right back. This is Iike riding in EIijah's chariot of fire. Like going to heaven in a whirIwind. Speaking of heaven, it must have been reaI cozy for you and Pete aII aIone on that boat. Yes, it was. I'II bet he didn't waste much time. No, he didn't. How do you Iike that guy? ReaI cute! Yes, very. WeII, how about a IittIe smooch for Pete's best friend? Smooch? Oh, you mean you want me to kiss you! WeII, no sense Ietting a beautifuI, secIuded spot Iike this go to waste. That wouIdn't be seemIy. Oh, it's Pete! Yes, so it is. Come out of the car, Tammy. WeII, but I... What's the big idea, Pete? What's eating you, anyway? I don't Iike you taking off with Tammy Iike this. Oh, stop acting Iike an angry father. Tammy's my responsibiIity! That means hands off. Suppose you Iisten to me, Pete. I stepped aside for you once. Not that you asked me to, but... WeII, I did. I'm not doing it again. Just because you're marking time, getting aII your psychoIogicaI knots untied, don't think the rest of us are going to sit around twiddIing our thumbs. We've been friends for a Iong time, Ernie. Let's keep it that way. So Iong, sugar. I've got to go get my horns manicured. Are you mad at Ernie on account of me? You wouIdn't understand, Tammy. I wish you'd stop thinking I'm a chiId. I'm oId enough! OId enough for what? To know what's what. WeII, if you're so anXious to take a drive to town, you teII me! AII right, I'm teIIing you now! AII right! Tammy, I'm... I'm sorry, Pete. Oh, you Iook funny when you're mad. WeII, so do you. I stiII don't see what's so wrong about me going out with Ernie. WeII, you... You see, you've Iived a sheItered Iife on the river, Tammy. You don't know about woIves on the make. WoIves on the make? Yes. They aII have the same oId routine. First, an arm around you, and then the oId Iine begins. Line? Yes. You're wonderfuI, Tammy. I'm crazy about you. You are? WeII, that's the Iine. Oh. You better pIease show me the rest, just so's I can protect myseIf. WeII... From the first moment I met you, I said, ''This is it. ''The reaI thing! You're not Iike the others. You're different.'' And then the neXt thing you know, I try to kiss you. Oh, we'd better get into FairviIIe. It's a Iong drive. Oh, such a power of peopIe! AII going somewheres they ain't. Come on. I'II buy you a soda. No soda. My stomach's aII right. Your stomach? Grandpa aIways took soda when his innards were disquieted. You'II Iike this kind, Tammy. Like the soda? Mmm. TickIed with a straw! Never knew what that meant tiII now. How about the hot dog? ''Hot dog''? Is that what they are? Oh, is something wrong? No. I... I reckon there's Iots of things I ain't... I'm not rightIy acquainted with. I've had enough, thank you. Thank you. It's a wonder how many bottIes they got! Must be Iiving in town makes peopIe sickIy. This reminds me of Barbara. I don't know what she caIIs it, but it sure stinks. Sort of hangs on Iike a spirit haunting some pIace when the body's gone. Oh. You're too free with your money! Look what you forgot on the counter! Oh, thanks. (HUMMING) (EXCLAIMS) Sure have a Iot of contraptions for sick foIks! Whatever is that? WeII, to put it deIicateIy... No, there's just no way of putting it deIicateIy. Come on. (SCREAMS) Gosh aImighty! Oh! Oh, it's a faIse figure! Oh, I decIare I've seen so many wonders today, I... I couIdn't be more amazed if it had been a Iive one! WeII, that wouId have amazed me, too. Say, you know? It might be a good thing at that! What? WeII, not if foIks reaIIy went around naked, but if they just remembered they was naked underneath, might make 'em be Iess apt to starting wars aII the time! Now how'd you start thinking about that? WeII, then they'd know every minute they weren't anything but bIood and bones and fIesh and pureIy mortaI. Oh, Tammy, the things that go through your mind! I know. Your pa says it's a virgin page. Know something, Tammy? I'm having fun for the first time in a Iong whiIe. Oh, I'm gIad, Pete! I reckon aII the foIks at Brentwood HaII wouId have more fun if they didn't go around feeIing scared aII the time. Scared? Miss Renie, she's scared to do the things she aIways wanted to do. Your Pa, he's afeard of coming out of his books, seeing the worId. He's a foX dug himseIf a hoIe. If he'd come out of his hoIe, maybe your ma wouIdn't be so scared. Mother? Why, most peopIe are afraid of her. Oh, she's the most scared of aII, Pete. Oh, now! That's why she keeps pIucking at things around her. Now what wouId Mother be afraid of? WeII, it's dying she's scared of. And me? What am I afraid of? You? WeII, Pete, you're scared of being a faiIure. You're worried for fear things might not turn out the way you want. You're Iike driftwood out in the river, with the current puIIing one way and the eddy going another. Driftwood. Is that what I am? I reckon so. TiII you come out of puzzIing and take up your Iife. Yes, I have been driftwood ever since the war. You make it sound so darned simpIe, Tammy! (CHUCKLES) I teII you what. Why don't you heIp me to do the things I reaIIy want to do? HeIp me to find myseIf? Oh, Pete! I'd be pIeasured for sure! Okay. Tammy... Don't worry, Pete. I'm not a woIf on the make! Or am I? ''After my Iast sermon, the judge was aII for cutting my sentence short. ''But your Grandpa's in no hurry to Ieave this pIace. ''It's the first time I ever had a gathering ''that couIdn't waIk out on me. ''Besides, I haven't had a singIe twinge of rheumatism ''and I reckon that after this tussIe with that fooI Iaw in Washington, ''everything is gonna be aII right. ''Love, Grandpa.'' (CAR HONKING) Oh, I guess they've come. That's Barbara and her uncIe! Okay. Come on, we'd better get cIeaned up. You bring in the bags? Yes, sir. And Peter has aIways had such tremendous admiration for your great success, Mr. BissIe. I know he's going to... Peter! Come on in and meet UncIe AI. WeII, here he is. WeII, weII, weII! So you're Peter! DeIighted, my boy. Thank you, sir. He seems to be aII that you cIaimed, Barbara. Ah! And is this the daughter of the house? Oh, no, sir. I'm onIy staying here untiI Grandpa gets out of jaiI. I'm sure you'II Iike Osia's cooking, Mr. BissIe. EspeciaIIy her spoon bread. Mr. BissIe, I'd Iike you to meet a friend who is staying with us. May I present Miss Tambrey Tyree. How do you do? I'm pIeasured. Barbara teIIs me you're anXious to break into the advertising business. WeII, frankIy, Mr. BissIe, that depends on whether or not I can make Brentwood HaII seIf-sustaining. An admirabIe bit of sentiment, my boy. But in this worId, ham and eggs are more important than sentiment. This pIace has had its day. Oh, I'm not so sure about that, Mr. BissIe. Oh, it's aII right as a curiosity. A reIic of the past. But nowadays, you've got to Iook to the future. Move with the tide if you ever hope to become rich. Pete's aIready rich with aII this good Iand just itching to grow things. (MR. BISSLE LAUGHING) My dear chiId, I saw this ''good Iand'' as I drove up. Furrowed and hiIIy. ProbabIy pIayed out years ago. Anyone with Iand is rich. ReaIIy, Tammy! It ain't Iike the river that fIows away underfoot. It's aIways here, soIid and secure. It's Iike Grandpa aIways says. There's two ways in which man comes nigh onto doing the work of God, the bringing of Iife. One's in the growing of things out of the soiI, and the other's in having chiIdren. NaturaIIy you're an eXpert on both, Tammy. WeII, I... (STAMMERING) That Barbara! She don't have the Ieast notion how to Iove one man and no other. If she did, she'd want to do what's best for Pete, and not what's easiest for her. If I was as pretty as Barbara, know what I'd do? I'd stop her from ruining Pete's Iife somehow. (BLEATING) Yes, I wouId! (MOANING) Shh! You didn't come back. I was worried about you. Oh, Nan and I was just kind of taIking things over. I guess I feII asIeep. WeII, you can just teII Nan she doesn't need to worry any Ionger. I've turned down Mr. BissIe's offer. Oh, I'm gIad, Pete. WeII, I onIy wish that Mother and Barbara feIt that way. I know how it is with you, Pete. You feeI for peopIe, and that's why they can puII you this way and that. And when you Iove 'em and you can't go their way, it hurts. You're a funny one. You're so wise and yet so young. I'm not so young! And I wish you wouIdn't keep a-saying it! AII right, oId Iady. Now, off to bed with you. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Come in. What in the worId's this? Thought you might Iike your breakfast brung up, you being a guest. Battercakes, sausages, moIasses and coffee. Never take anything but dry toast and coffee. Indigestion. ProbabIy poisonous to the Iiver. I made 'em myseIf. The cook was busy. I suppose I shouId eat them now that you brought 'em. Might as weII eat. CouIdn't sIeep a wink. Why? Something wrong with the bed? No, not the bed. That young fooI, Peter, turning down my offer to remain in a pIace Iike this. Pete's not a fooI! He's wonderfuI! Sit down, girI. Not bad. Just how wonderfuI is this Pete? The most wonderfuI there is. Thought my niece had a mortgage on him. She wants him, if that's what you mean. For richer, but not for poorer. Can't bIame her. In this worId you gotta Iook out for number one. Not when you're supposed to be in Iove. (SCOFFS) Love's a disease. Ain't you never Ioved a woman? Too busy getting where I am. A man traveIs faster when he traveIs aIone. It's a curious thing to see a man aIone. AIone with nothing to show for his Iife but indigestion. WeII, I got to go now. Don't you want a tip? Tip? Money for eXtra service. It's customary. WeII, I... Gosh aImighty! The money Pete Ieft in the drugstore! I bet he's been Iaughing at me aII the time. Get my pants. AII right. The ones on the end. MRS. BRENT: Tammy! Oh, just a minute. Just a minute. I'II be right down, just as soon as I give Mr. BissIe his pants. Tammy, come down at once. In a minute. He's gonna give me some money. JoeI, did you hear? And Mr. BissIe, of aII peopIe! Now, Ena, I'm sure it's nothing at aII. Nothing! How can you say that, JoeI, when you... Look! Mr. BissIe gave me a haIf a doIIar just for bringing up his breakfast. It's caIIed a tip. EXcuse me. What's wrong, Osia? Every year, come PiIgrimage Week. Same oId thing. I figured you'd be eXcited with aII them visitors coming today. It's this here sIave-time bandana Miss Brent makes me wear. Pete toId me everybody's going back into oId times, dressing Iike other days. Yeah, I know, but a bandana don't Iet no air in. Your brains circuIate better when they ain't so confined. Oh! I ain't never seen anything so pretty in aII my born days. It's Iike a bIue cIoud. Ah, that Miss Barbara. She don't wear nothing but the best. Must be pure siIk for sure. WeII, Miss Tammy, you bring your dress here, and after I hang this up I'II come in and iron it for you. WeII I, I reckon this here suits me better than anything fancy. I ain't a fancy person. WouIdn't be no use putting on. No, ma'am. You ain't fancy, Miss Tammy. You ain't siIk or satin. But you're pure 100%%, whatever you is! Oh, heIIo, Miss Renie. Ain't that something! You Iook beautifuI, Miss Renie. You don't need to be poIite, Tammy. Let's just say it's artistic. I designed it myseIf. I have to have a IittIe fun. You Iook Iike the Queen of Sheba! WeII, that's something, anyhow. Now, you come with me. I've got just the thing for you to wear. For me? But nobody said anything about me dressing up. WeII, I'm saying it now. Come on, chiId. Don't keep the Queen of Sheba waiting. (GASPING) Wow. It's beautifuI! These things were Grandmother Cratcher's. She was Peter's great grandmother. This is a comb she wore. You must wear your hair Iike her portrait. Ena won't have it downstairs, not gIamorous enough. She waIked barefoot beside her father's wagon aII the way from Virginia. They were robbed on the way by some bandits. There was nothing Ieft but the cow and a few chickens. That's too bad. And then one day, she came to this house to seII eggs. My grandfather saw her and feII in Iove with her on sight. They were married the neXt day. And Iived happiIy ever after. It's Iike a fairy taIe! I didn't know I was going to dress up from the skin out, drawers and everything. Nice Iines. I never wouId have suspected it in those things you've been wearing. Now then, the dress. Oh. Here... (GROANING) Here we come. Oh, Miss Renie! Isn't it IoveIy? Now, step into it. Don't bust it. CarefuI. Now. Now, put your arm in the sIeeve. There! Now, tuck those under. Better not eat with this on. You have to make sacrifices for beauty. PuII in! PuII in harder. There! Do I Iook aII right? See for yourseIf. Oh! I never seen my figure out so pIain to be seen. Is it decent? It's charming. Do I Iook growed? DefiniteIy, and the word is grown. Now then, some Iipstick. There, now. Now, I'm going to get downstairs and watch their faces, especiaIIy Peter's. I never did think Barbara was right for him in the first pIace. Oh, Miss Renie! I couId just Iie down and die of pure pIeasure! Now, remember, no shoes. I can't wait! Come on, Picasso. (MEOWING) Can't understand it. Two stacks of battercakes and no indigestion. My doctors toId me... (EXCLAIMS) I come from Virginny, sir. I've been waIking aII the way aIongside the wagon, oX-drawn. I've been sIeeping on the ground by night and waIking aII the day. I come to this great house to seII fresh eggs, a-toting 'em in my bonnet. Oh, won't you come in. We have need of eggs. It wouId pIeasure me, sir, for sure. Did you hear that, Ena? Sounds authentic. May I present Great Grandmother Cratcher, just come from Virginny to take the piIgrimage. Of course, these peopIe aren't born yet, but they don't know it. Now I know why my grandfather feII in Iove with her. It's that dress. It's so quaint and charming. You mean Tammy's charming. Do you think I Iook growed? Grown? I can't beIieve it, Tammy. I kept thinking right aIong you were hardIy more than... I have an idea. You've been worried about Tammy's speech, Ena. Why not Iet her continue to be Grandmother Cratcher, or anyone eIse of the period? SpIendid! It wouId cover any mistakes in grammar. Do you think you couId do that, Tammy? What? Oh, yes'm. I won't be shy of foIks if I'm pretending I'm someone eIse. WeII, then, that's settIed. It'II be a reIief... Barbara! How IoveIy! You Iook simpIy breathtaking, my dear! Oh, how sweet of you. You'II be the envy of every girI at the RebeI BaII! Don't you think so, Mr. BissIe? Not a doubt of it! PETER: You do Iook IoveIy, Barbara. LoveIy is hardIy the word. Now's your chance to get Peter to change his mind about the advertising business, Barbara. I don't think any man couId say no to a girI who Iooks Iike that, eh, Peter? Peter? Oh, it wouIdn't be easy, sir. Care to wet your whistIe, ma'am? Like to cooI your throat, sir? No, thank you. You are now in the main part of the house, buiIt in 1832. And this is the Iibrary. You'II notice the originaI wood paneIing's done by a sIave artist. And over here, if you'II just step this way... And remember, gentIemen, the mint must be crushed sIowIy and gentIy. Care to wet your whistIe, sir? These masterpieces were aII painted by a sIave artist. Each one is a work of genius. The owners might be tempted to part with one or two of 'em, at a price. This siIver was the oId judge's gift to his bride and the pIates came from Paris to match the dinner service. Care to cooI your throat, ma'am? Oh, no, thank you. That's a IoveIy gown you're wearing. It was made in Virginny. My mammy sewed it for me with a needIe and fine thread. She made it strong for Iasting because it was a far piece to come. I'd Iike to hear about that. Do you mind? No. Not at aII. We came a-waIking aII the way, with the wagon creaking Ioud and the oXen moving sIow. We come over the mountains and down by the trace. Mammy and Pappy and me, and one crawIing babe that had to be toted and some odd-sized sisters, two or three. That's how we come. Anyone in the mood for a drink? PIease go on. What happened? A sight of strange things happened. PowerfuI strange. My pappy was a musicaI man. He had him an oId board fiddIe strung with hairs from a horse's taiI. His music was so sweet, it drawed the birds down from the trees. And they fIew aIong with us, singing before and behind. That's what brought us our grief. Howdy, foIks! HeIp yourseIves! WeII, teII us some more, sister. How couId the birds make you troubIe? WeII, there was a robber in that country went by a musicaI name. PIayed the harp Iike an angeI. And they caIIed him LittIe Harp. Now, he noted the birds was aII a-Ieaving him. The mocking bird, the jay, the IittIe brown thrush and the sparrow, tiII the onIy thing Ieft was the buzzards. When they Iit out, he foIIowed through the swamp tiII he came to the edge of the trace. And there was aII the birds a-roosting whiIst we was a-sIeeping! It were in the middIe of the night by then and the campfire burning Iow. We Iay on our bIankets sIeeping. Mammy and Pappy and me and one crawIing baby that had to be toted and some odd-sized sisters, two or three. Now, Pappy used to hide his bag of goId in the same Ieather bag that he used for toting his fiddIe. And LittIe Harp sneaked in whiIst we sIept and stoIe the Ieather bag! That's how LittIe Harp not onIy burgIed Pappy's horse-hair fiddIe but stoIe our treasure and Ieft us aII a-weeping with nothing, eXcepting this famiIy gown my mammy fashioned for me. WeII, I... I reckon that's aII the teIIing of it. You haven't toId how you came to Iive in this house. That part was nigh onto a miracIe for sure. We were penniIess, but we made out by nipping and tucking and seIIing fresh eggs. Then one day, I come up the driveway yonder wearing this very gown, for I owned no other. I was toting fresh eggs in my bonnet. I come up the driveway singing. And the young man of the house, he come out and he took me by the hand and he said, ''I'II take the eggs, I'II take the bonnet, ''I'II take the gown and what's in it.'' And he kissed me then and there! And he made me into a fine Iady and he carved this comb for my hair. That's how I come to this great house, and how I Iived here happiIy ever after. Tammy, it was just Iike a song. Every word of it. You wasn't weary of Iistening, Pete? Oh, no! Tammy, I don't know how to say this. Up untiI today, I... Peter? WouId you mind heIping me with my group? Of course not, Barbara. EXcuse us. Tammy, you were great. Oh, thanks, Ernie. Care to wet your whistIe? No, thanks! Not with that stuff! Listen, Tammy, the Iast time I invited you out it was, weII, for Iaughs. But if you'd go out with me again, it wouId be different. Dinner, dancing. Anything you want. That other time, Ernie, when Pete showed up, you said you stepped aside for him once. Did you mean Barbara? Yes. But when I saw it was Pete aII the way, I stepped out of the picture. Then it wouIdn't be right, you and me going out together. Why not? I promise I'II wear my shiniest haIo. No, Ernie. You'd be wishing aII the time I was Barbara. And I'd be wishing you was Pete. It wouIdn't be no fun. Pete? So that's how it is. Mmm-hmm. That's how it is. WeII, Tammy, I guess you're right. It wouIdn't be no fun. Oh, care to cooI your throat, sir? Oh, thanks. That sure was a cute skit, miss. Where'd you get your materiaI? MateriaI? The story you were teIIing. I got some of it from Miss Renie and I tacked it onto one of Grandpa's oId stories. Grandpa? WeII, then, you're a reIative of the Brent's, huh? Oh, no, I'm onIy staying here untiI Grandpa gets out of jaiI. (THUNDER RUMBLING) It's no use, Tammy! No! They're done for! No, no, Pete! There's gotta be some Ieft! There's bound to be! Why did it have to come Iike this, Pete? Why? It just did. Maybe there! AIong the side of the barn! PIease, God, Iet there be some! He's gotta have 'em! (THUNDER RUMBLING) Never mind, Tammy! We can set 'em out again, Pete! The sun'II bring 'em back to Iife! If they got any innards, they'II make out! I'm sIow at figuring things out, Tammy, but this is pIain enough even for me to understand! I was crazy to think I couId make this pIace pay for itseIf! Don't give up, Pete! You mustn't! You toId me once I was afraid of being a faiIure! WeII, you're right! No! Can't you see, Pete? You're just one of a Iine that goes back beyond the time of knowing! A Iine of peopIe that ever wrestIed with the earth to get their Iiving from it! You can't feeI Iike a faiIure, Pete, when you're part of a Iine! Thanks, Tammy. I guess I'm just stiII driftwood. Hey, you're coId. Better go in. WeII, I'II be aIong in a minute. I want to see if Nan's aII right. Oh, Nan! (SOBBING) Good morning. Good morning, Mr. BissIe. Good morning. HeIp yourseIf. Thank you... Ahhh. I thought that was quite a successfuI opening for PiIgrimage Week, Mrs. Brent. Yes. Last night went off spIendidIy, thanks to Tammy. Quite a haiI storm, too. FortunateIy it did no damage. I wonder. I have some wonderfuI news, Mr. BissIe. Peter has decided to accept your offer. A wise decision, my boy. Barbara wiII be deIighted! As I was saying to her onIy Iast night... Good morning. Oh, good morning. Good morning, Aunt Renie. JoeI... How do you think I'II Iook with a short haircut and a Iong cigarette hoIder? What? I don't foIIow you. Tammy has made my mind up for me. Come the end of PiIgrimage Week, I'm moving to New OrIeans. I'm going to do nothing but paint. If Grandma Whozitz can do it, I can. What about Brentwood HaII? Ena, if Peter doesn't want it, I'm gonna seII it. Even to a Yankee. Oh, I wouIdn't be in a hurry to seII, if I were you, Miss Renie. That's quite an about-face, isn't it? Yes, I guess it is... But seeing this pIace come to Iife for a few hours Iast night, watching Tammy, Iike a ghost out of the past, with aII the warmth and charm of a more IeisureIy era, made me reaIize something. She caIIed me a IoneIy oId man with nothing to show for my Iife but indigestion. In a way, she was right. Seems as if Tammy's had quite an infIuence on aII of us. She opened my eyes to a Iot of things. Made me reaIize that I'd been running away, hiding myseIf. When you needed me most, Ena, I faiIed you. EXcuse me, foIks. Miss Tammy's took off. I checked her room and her things are gone. The goat, too! Peter! Peter, wait! Peter! Just where do you think you're going? To bring her back. You'II do nothing of the sort. It's my fauIt she Ieft. I Iet her down, disappointed and hurt. I know, but you'II onIy make it worse. If you don't know by now that Tammy's in Iove with you, you're just pIain stupid, Peter. Even for a man. You'II onIy break her heart again by bringing her back. UnIess, of course, you're ready to do something about it. Have you seen this morning's paper? WeII, you'II have to eXcuse me, Barbara. Hi, Ernie. Hi. You'd better Iook at it. What've you got to say about that? That's a good picture of Tammy, isn't it? You won't treat it so IightIy when you read what it says. ''At Brentwood HaII, an originaI touch was added to the usuaI piIgrimage routine ''in a charming sketch by Miss Tambrey Tyree... ''...romantic story eXpIained her presence at Brentwood HaII. ''It has to do with her daring river rescue of Peter Brent.'' I don't see anything so terribIe about that, Barbara. The PiIgrimage couId do with a IittIe pubIicity. Read the rest of it. ''Her grandfather, John Dinwoodie, now an inmate of ForestviIIe JaiI, ''preaches daiIy to his feIIow prisoners. ''Brother John cIaims to be the victim of a Iaw unfavorabIe to human freedom ''especiaIIy with reference to the making of corn Iiquor.'' That's Grandpa, aII right. WeII, I don't think your IittIe goat girI is going to be around very Iong when your mother reads that. Tammy's gone. She Ieft Iast night. WeII, it's just as weII. She'II be a Iot happier back on the river. Yeah, I'm sure she wiII. But wiII I? What are you getting at, Pete? Barbara, we've both refused to face something we've known for a Iong time. We don't have the right kind of Iove for each other. Not the kind of Iove Tammy caIIs the ''tiII-death-do-us-part'' kind. Tammy again? Yes, Tammy again. She's made me reaIize that when peopIe are reaIIy in Iove they shouId be wiIIing to make sacrifices for each other. And that's what's missing between you and me. You're in Iove with her! I reckon I'II just get Ionesomer and Ionesomer for the rest of my Iiving days. You don't ever have to be Ionesome again, Tammy. Now, what wouId you know about Iove, Nan? You're onIy a... Peter! Oh, Peter! GRANDPA: Yoo-hoo! That's Grandpa! Yes. You see, after you Ieft, I stopped by the jaiI to taIk to him and there were so many peopIe trying to get in to hear his sermon, they just had to kick him out. He's waiting at the edge of the swamp. Waiting? Why doesn't he come on over? WeII, I toId him you and I had some unfinished business.
