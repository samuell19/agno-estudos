[OPENING SOLO BUILDS] [ROLLING CHORDS] It's enough to know I can do it. And whether or not anybody hears it or not, it is - it's mine. [STRONG, PERCUSSIVE CHORDS] [SOUND FADES INTO HALLWAY] WOMAN: I think I first started hearing Norman playing when I started taking the elevator. And I'd hear music coming out through the door. [STATELY PIANO MELODY SOUNDS BEHIND DOOR] I started... waiting before I'd press the button. Especially when he was playing Ravel.

I'm going to a concert at night which is what I do most nights. And before the concert, I decided I need to have some dinner because the critic must be fed. [RAIN SPATTERING] The rain was coming down horizontally. So I just darted into a hotel restaurant. And then two other refugees from the rain walked in. WOMAN: I look over and I see Howard Reich sitting at a table by himself. HOWARD: It so happened, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was in the midst of a French music festival. So I asked them the immediate question that came to mind, which is, "Did you hear the Ravel Left Hand Concerto?" And I said, "Oh!" and Almarie said, "Oh!" and we both said simultaneously, "We should tell Norman." and... Howard said, "Who's Norman?" [BRISK MUSIC PLAYING] HOWARD: One of the women said, "There's this man who lives on the same floor as me. "I hear all of this beautiful piano music coming out, "and I found out he plays only with his left hand." I thought, "Left hand? "Do you think you could introduce me to him?" [ENERGETIC JAZZ MUSIC] A few weeks later it was set up, I met Norman where he goes every Sunday to hear jazz. And as soon as I saw him. I recognized that face. Because I'd been seeing him at concerts for the past 20 or 30 years. [HEARTY APPLAUSE] He never had told anyone what happened to him. MUSICIAN: Thank you very much. HOWARD: They all assumed that he had had a stroke or something like that. He also kept another secret. He still had been practicing the piano. [OPENING SOLO OF 'THE RAVEL'] Especially the Ravel Left Hand Concerto, which he had been working on for over 60 years. ♪ Well that makes a story for a journalist. [RISING CHORDS] It ran on the front page of the Tribune for three days running during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend when everybody's looking at the paper. And suddenly, Norman is famous. NEWSMAN SCOTT PELLEY: We end tonight with a musician who discovered there was no end to his talent. NEWS ANCHOR: Norman Malone is one of Chicago's very own. HOWARD: The week after the story ran, Norman starts receiving invitations to give concerts.

[ADULTS LAUGH] And when I was a little older than you are now, I had an injury. So I had to learn how to play the piano with only one hand. [NORMAN DEMONSTRATES OPENING SOLO OF 'THE RAVEL'] ♪ I was always interested in music. And I started it when I was five. [CLAMORING LOW NOTES] [NOTES GLIDING UPWARD TO A CLIMAX] [CLAPPING] NORMAN: Good! [SOFT PIANO NOTES] My parents bought me a upright white piano. It was downstairs on the first level of the Ida B. Wells unit we owned. [HIGH NOTE ON VIOLIN] My house was very tense. I didn't understand it. But I knew there was something that... wasn't quite settling. [MINOR KEY STRINGS] According to my mother, my father had advanced stages of syphilis. And he knew that he was going to die. She found a hatchet underneath the bed. So... she knew that something could happen at any time. The night of the accident, I was told to stay awake. And of course, I fell asleep. [EERIE WHINE OF VIOLINS] Rather than burdening my mother of raising three boys, my father decided he was going to take us with him. [EERIE VIOLIN WHINE] He assumed that all three of us and him were dead. And all three of us survived. I remember the three of us laying side by side in a hospital. We couldn't move. Yeah, it was panic. Panic! Your ability to walk was gone. Your ability to use your right hand was gone. I had to learn how to write. I had to learn how to pick up things. But I wanted to play piano. [A QUIET SOLO FROM 'THE RAVEL' BEGINS] It became... the force of survival. [STEADY, WAVE-LIKE MELODY] INSTRUCTOR:...two... three... [MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGHOUT] NORMAN: Tai Chi, it's the timing involved. You have to get certain poses at a certain rate of speed, and it's consistent, so it's rhythm. INSTRUCTOR: Just wipe, left hand on top. And hands come back to the middle. [MUSIC SURGES] NORMAN: All motion, all movement, is music. [PIANO NOTES RISE AND FALL IN WAVES] [MUSIC STOPS] [FINAL DESCENDING CHORDS] LECTURER: I don't see what I want and what the composer wants as two separate things. What I want to do is to create a direct line between Mozart and the Mozart listener. [A RECORDING PLAYS FROM MOZART'S THE MAGIC FLUTE] NORMAN: After the injury, playing piano never left my mind. ♪ I remember in high school, they had a music appreciation class. I wanted to be in that class. [LECTURE RESUMES] Of course I was in the handicap school at that time. But finally they let me in. And I was listening to Wagner. And I thought, "Whoa! "I made it." That class really sparked my energy. [APPLAUDING] I wanted to see if it's possible for me to continue piano. [MOZART PIANO CONCERTO PERFORMANCE] When it was time to graduate, I told them I wanted to play music. They thought perhaps something wasn't quite right with my thinking. They sent me to a psychologist. He said, "Do you realize that you don't have both hands?" "Yes, I do." "And you still want to do this?" "Yes I think I do." "Mhmm... So what do you think you can do "with just one hand?" And I thought, "Okay... "Norman shut up." [SINISTER OPENING MUSIC FROM 'THE RAVEL'] I can remember sitting in a therapist's office as he's showing me these ink blots. "Now, look at this other one here." Boom. "What do you see? "Mm hmm. All right." With that... questionable look in their eyes. [DEEP, RUMBLING BASSOON] And I thought, "Uh-oh... "I, I'm insane. They gonna commit me." ♪ I began to investigate on my own. I went down Michigan Avenue, trying to find a teacher in the Fine Arts Building and other buildings down there. Well, once they found out that I wasn't able to play with two hands, they looked at me like, you know, "This is an impossibility." [DOWNCAST ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Until I finally found Lester Mather. And he said, "Okay! "Let's try it." He was the first one that believed that I could do it. [MUSIC BRIGHTENS] He was my hero. [SLOW PIANO MUSIC] We began looking for material for the left hand. [NORMAN PRACTICING] Carl Fischer, Lyon and Healy. I got everything they had. The first material we found was very basic. Elementary songs, spirituals. [NORMAN PLAYS DEEP RIVER] [SONG GRADUALLY SLOWS TO AN END] [SUSTAINED FINAL CHORD] And then when you finally found something of substance, it was always classical. [NORMAN PRACTICES BARTOK'S STUDY FOR THE LEFT HAND] Bela Bartok's Study for the Left Hand. [PRACTICING SLOWLY AND MINDFULLY] Anyone looking at it would think, "Well, this can't be done by one hand alone." [A SERIES OF STRONG, DELIBERATE CHORDS] But it's very cleverly spaced. Triplets, bass and treble clef, bouncing back and forth, all the way through. And that's the secret of successful left hand compositions. I was doing good. I finally decided to audition for DePaul. And I was accepted. [UPBEAT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] I was excited. [BUOYANT PIANO MELODY] I can remember my last year, I had to take an education class. Teacher in there was Dr. Anne Lally. And she took me aside and said, "What was I planning on doing?" I said, "Teaching," and she says, "How can you teach, you're handicapped? "And you'll have trouble getting up and down stairs, "doing things like that." And I thought, "Oh, my God, I've been training all this while "and now... "there's a possibility that I can't teach." But I thought, "Well, you've gotten this far. "Keep going." [CHEERS, CLAPS, AND WHISTLES] STUDENT 1: Hello! NORMAN: Yes! Yes. STUDENT 1: Barbara. You used to call me Goober Petunee.

It hasn't left. CHOIR [SINGING]: ♪ Silent night, Holy night ♪ REPORTER: Members of the Lincoln Park High School chorus performing at the Art Institute on Michigan Avenue today, led by music teacher Norman Malone. When Mr. Malone came to the school five years ago, it had no chorus. Now it has a girls chorus and a mixed chorus where the boys join in.

I mean, he makes everyone listen. REPORTER: You're tough on those kids. NORMAN: Yeah. Yeah, but... I'm very tough on them, but I'm also tough on myself.

Arthur, my younger brother, is bedridden, and... my middle brother Irving, he is really having a difficult time. And out of the three, I was the one that succeeded.

[MARK PLAYS ANOTHER COMPOSITION] NORMAN: I personally blamed myself for the injury. My therapist had to help me realize that it wasn't my fault. And I had to accept that. I was a child. It was quite a revelation. [LIVELY PIANO NOTES RISING AND FALLING] I could have been at home with my brothers. But I wanted so much more. And so therefore I had to break out. [NOTES GLIDING DOWNWARDS] ♪ [DOOR SLIDES OPEN] This is a collection of all my left hand compositions that I've had bound. I think I have... 300, 400 plus left hand compositions that I've discovered. When I first started, there were only a handful of left hand compositions that I was aware of. This is my thesis about, um - Paul Wittgenstein. My savior. [ORIGINAL RECORDING] [AN ELEGANT PASSAGE] It was a natural thing for me to do: Analyze Wittgenstein's complete volume of left hand material. [FLUTTERING HIGH NOTES] These concertos were commissioned by Paul Wittgenstein. The Hindemith has an interesting history. Paul Wittgenstein refused to play it. So it was left unknown until after his death. [PIANO AND FULL ORCHESTRA PLAYING A BRISK MELODY] [DEEP, FORCEFUL PIANO NOTES] The Benjamin Britten. I don't know why they don't play that more often. [MODERNIST PIANO SOLO] [RAPIDLY RISING SCALE] Or the Richard Strauss. [A QUIETLY REGAL MELODY] And the Prokofiev Concerto for the Left Hand. [RAPID, ENERGETIC PIANO ACCOMPANIED BY STRINGS] That's quite a tricky piece, and very seldom played. There are other composers that have written beautiful works. [GRAND, SWEEPING PIANO MELODY] [STRONG PUNCTUATIONS BY PIANO AND ORCHESTRA] But the Ravel... it's the most outstanding left hand piece in the whole repertoire. [STEADY, DEEP CASCADES ON SOLO PIANO] This is a piece that I was meant to play. So I wanted to find out as much as I could. [PIANO SOLO CONTINUES OVER SOUNDS OF NATURE] [INSECTS BUZZING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SOMEONE KNOCKS ON A DOOR] WOMAN: Dear Norman. NORMAN: How are you? JOAN: I've heard SO much about you! Finally you're here. NORMAN: Yes. JOAN: Can I give you a big hug? NORMAN: Oh, yes. Yes. NORMAN: Look at that! That's your father. JOAN: That's my dad. I'm putting him in his forties around this time. I'm not quite sure. JOAN [OFF CAMERA]: My father was Paul Wittgenstein. The musical world knows him as the pianist who played with his left hand only. [QUIET PASSAGE FROM 'THE RAVEL'] My father lived in Vienna. He gave his first concert in 1914. And then, World War One started. [DEEP RUMBLE ON PIANO] My father enrolled in the army. A Russian bullet caught him in the right arm. And they took him prisoner, and they had to amputate the arm. But that wasn't going to stop him. First he made a cardboard cutout of the piano keys and he'd practice and practice and practice. And then there was an old piano that was out of tune. He could practice on that. [REVERBERATING CHORDS] But then they sent him home. Normally, a person would have said, "Maybe I better think of something else to be." but that's not who he was. He looked around, and there was no music for the left hand - something concert worthy. [INTRICATE PIANO FLOURISH] And that's where the Ravel came from. JOAN [READING]: Ravel was old and rather frail by then, plagued by insomnia and fatigue. "But," he said in French, "I make a game of difficulty." My father wanted to be certain that, "The concerto must not be a stunt. "The listener must never feel that more could have been accomplished with two hands. The piano part must be complete, beautiful and transparent." NORMAN [READING]: Ravel invited Wittgenstein to his home near Paris to listen to the finished work. "Wittgenstein wasn't overwhelmed by the composition. "I suppose Ravel was disappointed. "And I was sorry, "but I had never learned to pretend. "Only much later after I studied the Concerto for months "did I become fascinated by it "and realize what a great work it was." [ORIGINAL RECORDING] [PLAYING COMPLEX CLIMACTIC SOLO] JOAN: This is my favorite picture. Do you see that hand? NORMAN: M-hm. JOAN: My father is doing finger exercises. NORMAN: Yeah, I do that too. JOAN: You probably do. NORMAN: Yeah. JOAN: There's no sitting still. NORMAN: This is so similar to me. JOAN: You recognize yourself? NORMAN: Yeah. JOAN: So I wanted to tell you a little bit about this piano that you're sitting at. This guy was in my father's room where he would just do exercises in the middle of the night if he had to - NORMAN: Ahh! JOAN: This was his, And all the - the big ones were given away. [NORMAN REHEARSES WAVE-LIKE MELODY FROM 'THE RAVEL'] [STRONG, ROLLING NOTES] [MUSIC FADES] VOICE ON TV: Why is there a bandage on my hand? DOCTOR: Well, fortunately there will be only slightly diminished use of three fingers. For how long? Afraid it will be permanent. Oh my God. DOCTOR: But your leg will be fine. PATIENT: I don't care about my leg. These are my life, I play the piano. I'm a concert pianist. A pianist? Are you familiar with the story behind the Ravel? PATIENT: No, and I don't really... DOCTOR: It was written for an Austrian concert pianist named Paul Wittgenstein. He lost his right arm during the First World War. Don't you see? Your hand may be still. But your gift cannot be silenced if you refuse to let it be. [TENTATIVELY PLAYS OPENING OF 'THE RAVEL'] [CONTINUING MORE CONFIDENTLY] [INCREASING SPEED AND STRENGTH] [PLAYING WITH VIRTUOSIC MASTERY] He just sat down and played that! NORMAN: Yeah... JOAN: Oh come on. NORMAN: It takes years... [LAUGHING TOGETHER] [RAIN PATTERS SOFTLY] Wittgenstein was able to commission these pieces. And that really encouraged me to say, "Well, I can do that too." [A RAGTIME PIANIST PERFORMS SWEET ENVY] I'm always interested in trying to find new left hand compositions. ♪ For years, if I heard something interesting, and I got a chance to approach the composer, I'd casually say, "Oh, would you ever think of writing something?" And that never materialized. ♪ HOWARD: When Norman told me about his frustration, I introduced him to someone I've written about for years. NORMAN: Reginald Robinson is a genius ragtime composer. And he thought, "Oh! This is a challenge." [SWEET ENVY ENDS WITH A FLOURISH] REGINALD: Hi! NORMAN: Welcome. REGINALD: Hey, Norman. NORMAN: How are you? REGINALD: I'm fine, how about you? But I figured it. There has to be a way to... get that sound. NORMAN: Mm hmm. REGINALD: And you know, within uhh... one hand. NORMAN: Mm-hm, mm-hm. REGINALD: So for ragtime, really the left hand has a role of going bass note, chord, bass note, chord. [PLAYING RAGTIME AT A VERY FAST TEMPO] REGINALD: But this time, I'm playing in places where the right hand in ragtime would usually, uh, cover certain notes. I've never heard of a left hand ragtime composition. Ragtime is a steady beat against syncopated rhythms. And Eubie Blake, the great ragtime pianist, always said, "This hand has nothing to do with this hand." So now I can go, "THIS hand has nothing to do with THIS hand!" Play it for me. REGINALD: Okay. [AN EASY-GOING RAGTIME MELODY] [LEADING UP TO A FINAL FLOURISH] NORMAN: I love it! I can hear it, I can hear it. Now... Can I PLAY it? [SLOWLY AND METHODICALLY] REGINALD: I put the fingering in specifically. Over time it becomes easier to pull off. [DEMONSTRATING CORRECT FINGER POSITIONS] So it's one... Mm-hm. [NORMAN TRIES THE FINGERING] Then reach - with your thumb there, reach over for the second, second finger... to B. And three. And it sets you right at four. [NORMAN IMPROVISES AN ENDING] This is going to be great. [LAUGHING WITH GLEE] [PRACTICING AT A DELIBERATELY SLOW TEMPO] [AUDIENCE MURMURING] NORMAN: Oh! I don't need to see that. REGINALD: Yeah, I was gonna tell you. NORMAN: Haha! I don't need to see that. God. What have I gotten myself into? REGINALD [CHUCKLING]: Oh, wow! NORMAN: But it sounds okay? REGINALD: It sounds fine. You sound really good. Yeah. NORMAN: Okay. All right. REGINALD: One thing I would suggest is just play it slow. Take your time. Play it at whatever tempo you want. NORMAN: Yeah. REGINALD: No one's heard this before, so whatever you do is - NORMAN: Yeah. Yeah. But I was glad I came over yesterday to touch the piano. I thought, "Whoa!" REGINALD: It's a different feel from at home? NORMAN: Oh, yeah. REGINALD: The action is more - NORMAN: It's heavier. As a child, I played church organ. I would play for Mass. But then a pastor, was a new pastor, and he said, "Oh, you're the cripple one." And I thought, "Whoa." I didn't know how to respond to something like that. No one had ever said that. I said, "Well... "I'll never touch the organ again." REGINALD: Mmm. NORMAN: Reginald's piece is contributing to the field of left hand repertoire, which is so needed. [EXCITED APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE FADES] So I have to live up to my part. [HUSHED SILENCE] [ROBUST OPENING OF NORMAN MALONE'S RAG] [PLAYING AT A SLOW, MEASURED PACE] [INTRODUCING A RELAXED RAGTIME SWING] [MISSES NOTE, THEN RECOVERS] [MUSIC TRANSITIONS TO A NEW, BREEZY MELODY] NORMAN: A composition like this has never been written before. And I'm so grateful that I asked Reginald to do it. [TENTATIVELY] [MORE CONFIDENTLY] [HITTING A WRONG NOTE -] [CLEANLY FINISHING THE PERFORMANCE] [APPLAUSE] [TUNING INSTRUMENTS] [HORNS AND WOODWINDS JOIN] [TUNING STOPS] [PERFORMANCE OF AN ORCHESTRAL OVERTURE BEGINS] ♪ I'm one of the founders of the West Hartford Symphony Orchestra. The former president of the board sent me a link and said, "Gee, you ought to take a look at this." It had a real effect on me emotionally. And so I wrote to him. And the next day, my phone rang. It said Norman Malone. He said, "My son and daughter-in-law live in Connecticut." And I said, "Well - "if you have the Ravel under your fingers, "and you're comfortable with it, "how about playing it with "the West Hartford Symphony Orchestra?" I thought, "Holy Mother, "Holy Mother. Okay. All right." [VIOLINS HOLD ON FINAL NOTE] There you are. [LISTENING TO CD OF 'THE RAVEL'] I had to think long and hard about it. I get nervous every time I have to perform. [ORCHESTRAL CLIMAX] But to play with an orchestra! How many people get that offer? [OPENING PIANO SOLO] HOWARD: The level of risk to play a concerto with orchestra for the first time is huge. To do it at age 79 when you've never played a concert, and you've never played with orchestra before, is monumental. [THUNDEROUS PIANO MUSIC] [RISING NOTES] [MUSIC BOUNCES BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW CHORDS] It took me so long to learn the Ravel that I'm afraid if I don't practice parts of it every day, I'll lose it. [REHEARSING A NEW SECTION] So it's a daily prayer. Of course, I can't play the orchestra part. I had to find an accompanist. ACCOMPANIST: How are ya? NORMAN: Fine. ACCOMPANIST: Hi, I'm Bryan Shilander. NORMAN: Norman Malone. BRYAN: It's a pleasure. Come on in. [PLAYING THE ORCHESTRAL OPENING] BRYAN: So if I go: And one, two, three.... BRYAN: Right? NORMAN: Yeah. NORMAN: Bryan and I, we clicked. So he played the orchestra part. BRYAN: And then you hear this. [ALTERNATING PHRASES] NORMAN: And then that? [STRUGGLING] BRYAN: There's a little bit of freedom there. NORMAN: It's getting used to hearing your part. BRYAN: Yeah, it's distracting, isn't it? NORMAN: Yeah, yeah. It's like, oh God. Where am I now? ♪ NORMAN: When I realized how many piano concertos for the left hand have been written, this is the only one that has survived the test of time. HOWARD: The question is why? The Ravel concerto tells a story. It's Wittgenstein's story. His great, profound loss and his struggle to overcome that loss. And therefore it also tells the story of Norman Malone. [YEARNING MELODY] [BEGINNING TO STRUGGLE AGAIN] NORMAN: Okay, all right. BRYAN: Give it a try? NORMAN: Yeah. [BEGINNING AGAIN] HOWARD: It begins with the double basses playing so low that we can barely discern what they're playing. [ORCHESTRA BEGINS PLAYING 'THE RAVEL'] There's this murmuring, growling going on. [BASSOONS JOIN] We almost cannot decode what we're hearing. And what is the instrument doing from down low? Climbing up. And how is it climbing up? With what musicians call dotted rhythms, which basically means a very long note followed by a very short note. [WOODWINDS PLAY DOTTED RHYTHMS] HOWARD [DEMONSTRATING]: Ba bum, ba bum, ba-ba-bum, ba bum. [STRING SECTION CRESCENDOS] This gives the music a kind of nobility or heroism that we're going to hear over and over again, as this struggle continues of a pianist trying to see if he can still make music with one hand. [OPENING SOLO] [RUMBLING NOTES BUILD ON ONE ANOTHER] This is a colossal opening statement. You would never guess it was being played by one hand, it wouldn't even enter your mind. [BOUNCING NOTES] And now the main statement. Here's where the pianist first plays the heroic theme. [GRAND, STATELY MELODY PLAYS] [LOW REVERBERATING NOTES] It's a statement of self affirmation and of power. It's epic. [ROLLING FLOURISHES] [COMPLEX, BOUNCING MUSIC] This is one of the first grueling parts of the piece because the pianist is bouncing all over the keyboard high to low, and these leaps are so far apart, and the chords are so complex that it's like target practice trying to hit each one correctly. And getting through this one long measure is almost impossible. It's so hard that they've got to grab hold of the right side of the piano in order to stabilize themselves and finesse these large leaps. It's even harder for Norman Malone, because not only can he not physically grab the piano, Norman has only one leg that works properly. So in order for him to use the pedal to get a bigger sound, or to control color, or voicing, or create sonic illusions, he's got to put his left foot over on the right side pedal, and he cannot use two pedals at once, which all great pianists want to do to create special effects. [REPEATED RAPID LOW NOTES] [NOTES SLIDING UPWARDS TO A FINISH] NORMAN: Just keep working on it. BRYAN: Yeah, it's come a long ways. [DISTANT SOUNDS OF REHEARSAL] [PIANO BEGINS PLAYING] ♪ [COMPLEX PATTERN OF INTERLOCKING NOTES] HOWARD: The top notes, the melody notes are being played rhythm of two on the top and rhythm of three on the bottom. Ravel is creating the illusion of two hands playing at once. The notes are not striking at the same time. And this makes the ear think the right hand is playing the melody and the left hand is playing the accompaniment. But in fact, one hand is playing all of this at the same time. [PIANO IS JOINED BY CLARINET] [NORMAN BEGINS TO FALTER] This theme is like the opposite of the heroic theme. Where the hero theme is full of vigor and grandeur, this is very yearning and longing. [RICHLY LAYERED MELODY] This is a very vulnerable portrait of the protagonist of the piece, which is the left handed pianist. [NORMAN PLAYS TENDER, CARESSING MELODY] [REHEARSING INSIDE] RICHARD: That was... very close. I just want to make sure we can... you do slightly better than very close for Saturday morning. [RAPID STACCATO NOTES] [FALSE START] NORMAN: Oh. Sorry. [ANOTHER FALSE START] NORMAN: Ahh. RICHARD: One, twoooo, threeeee-yup! Ba-bee-bababa... NORMAN: Ummm... It's so hard for me to just see that. Can I start back at 17? RICHARD: Sure. One, two, one, and - [FUMBLING] NORMAN: I'm just getting... frustrating myself. RICHARD: So it's one, two, two two, harp, two... I've always admired Norman's stick-to-it-ness. [NORMAN MUTTERS] [FUMBLING AGAIN] He just meets a difficult moment head on, and just keeps hammering at it. Nope, yeah. No, so you got that too soon. So keep in mind, I mean you gotta be aware of that - [GRUNTING] one, two tri-ple-et, tri-ple-et, one, two tri-ple-et, tri-ple-et. [NORMAN JOINS IN RHYTHM] HOWARD: Everyone plays the Ravel concerto differently. I was at Orchestra Hall and heard a pianist play the left hand concerto note perfectly, fine. And you know what that performance did not capture? What this piece is about: the struggle. [PLAYS WITH GREAT DELIBERATION] [PRACTICING CONTINUES] [PRACTICING CONCLUDES] [ORCHESTRA BUSILY WARMS UP] [WOODWINDS PRACTICING] [OVERLAPPING COMMOTION] RICHARD: I think the nature of any community orchestra is the nature of amateurs. These are people who love music. It's a mix of youth and age. We have, I believe, seven doctors. So I've been able to tell the orchestra if any of them have problems we've got a psychiatrist, we've got a dentist, we've - you know we have uh, many - we can solve their problems for them. Norman has not worked with an orchestra. He could do it at any speed he wants at home. But when you get to rehearse with an orchestra, mmmm. [CHAOTICALLY OVERLAPPING INSTRUMENTS] RICHARD: All right, Norman. NORMAN: Ahhhhhh! [CHUCKLING] Oh, okay. [REPETITIVE STACCATO CELLO NOTES] [RICHARD HUMS THE MELODY] [HUMMING CONTINUES] [NORMAN STUMBLES] NORMAN: Ah! RICHARD: Okay. Uh... it must have been my singing, right Norman? NORMAN: That is, the singing, yeah. RICHARD: Second measure of 30. [CLEARING HIS THROAT] Second bar of 30 please. Right where Norman enters. One, two. [PLAYING CORRECT NOTES, SLIGHTLY OUT OF SYNC] HOWARD: When you're on stage with 60 other musicians, if you lose your place, it could be a disaster because the orchestra will keep playing no matter what. Norman does these high risk events when you could potentially humiliate yourself publicly. That's courage. [FLOWING MELODY] NORMAN: I don't think you ever get there. I think it's a lifetime commitment. That cadenza - is eight or nine pages of solo piano. And it starts off low, and works up to a melody. [MELODY ASCENDS ALONGSIDE DEEP, SURGING CHORDS] [PLAYING STRENGTHENS] And it keeps building on that melody until it just breaks out and then the orchestra comes in. And you're just ripping through it. Ripping through it. [TORRENT OF DEEP, FIRM CHORDS] Oh, it makes your blood just - hits the top of the roof. [THE ORCHESTRA CRESCENDOS] [MUSIC SLOWLY FADES] RICHARD: But we can fix things, whatever we want to. NORMAN: Once we played all the way through, it was better. RICHARD: Yes, because that's more of what you're used to. NORMAN: I'm used to just playing it straight through. RICHARD: Straight through. NORMAN: Right, right. NORMAN: Okay, all right. RICHARD: All right, relax. We'll see you around one o'clock tomorrow. HOWARD: How's it going? RICHARD: Good. Good. Very good. Some spots are much more solid... [PASSING TRAFFIC] [DISTANT TUNING OF ORCHESTRA] NORMAN: Thank you. Say a prayer. MUSICIAN:: You sound great. NORMAN: Say a prayer. Say a prayer. CONCERTMASTER: And so we play, it's not a pretty note. NORMAN: Okay. CONCERTMASTER: It's a weird, artificial harmonic. But you'll see my bow start to move. NORMAN: Alright. CONCERTMASTER: And if you see my bow moving, just wail on that piano. MARK MALONE: Ravel to me is about... a storm. It's tumultuous. And you're just, like, holding on. I'm excited to see him play with an orchestra.

[A NOTE REVERBERATES] [NORMAN HESITATES, PLAYING IMPROVISED CHORDS] [PAGE CRINKLES LOUDLY] It felt like I was out for days. I froze. And I thought, "You don't have time for this nonsense. "You got to continue." And in that split second I just went back. [NORMAN RECOVERS, RESUMES PLAYING] [PLAYING WITH INCREASING CONFIDENCE] RICHARD: In the middle of his opening statement, something had happened. [SLIGHT FUMBLE] And I was just waiting to see how he was gonna resolve this. There's a whoops here, uh, but I - how do I fix it? For the audience, it might have looked like a momentary rest in the music. So - not a big deal.
