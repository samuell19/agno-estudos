The motion sickness pills didn't help at all? What can I get you? Water? - Do you want water or anything? - No, just give me a second. Okay. A memorable weekend, right? First the glass-bottom boat barf fest, now this. Poor thing. Yeah, maybe... maybe some water would be good. Yeah, okay. Water. I'll be right back. Flight from hell, huh? Mexican airlines. But what do you expect for 199 round trip, right? Yeah, we never officially met. I'm Seth. The big guy over there's Matt. - And you are? - Motion sick... As well as engaged as in soon to be married, so you can buzz off. Everything's closed, but there is a water fountain by the bathroom. Weren't you the girl who was doing all those body shots at Se?or Frogs? Ha! In your dreams, Rico. - A little help? - Oh. Yeah. Well, at least we're back on American soil where you can hurl without fear of having a kidney stolen in the process. I think I might be done hurling for a while. Michael better not be planning an ocean cruise for your honeymoon. He's not. Good, 'cause you wouldn't last 10 minutes on open water. No, I mean he's not planning a honeymoon. I broke the engagement. Holy shit. I just figured you left the ring at home, so street urchins wouldn't chew your fingers off for it. Why didn't you tell me? We've only been best friends for like ten million years. I wanted to be sure. You know, take the weekend to unplug, clear my head. Sun and fun. What happened? I'm just too wiped to get into it. Oh, man, have I got the yellow fever? Somehow I doubt your particular malfunction is color specific. Asian women are so exotic. Oh, what, you're bored of me after only three days? You? Never. Mr. Crouse... Mr. Michael crouse, please come to a white courtesy phone... If it wasn't for me, you would've spent the weekend mired in whatever mind-numbing, toilet-torment, overworked, underpaid management trainees mire in. Instead I got to watch you hit on everything in a skirt in two time zones. You seriously need to get laid. And you need a 12-step program. - I got it. - Thanks. Wow, thank you. - Yeah, no problem. - Big bag. - It must be your lucky day. - I guess so. What's that about? Oh, she works with deaf children. How 'bout you, what do you do when you aren't frolicking around the Caribbean? Acting. Well, taking classes. Really? I bet the camera loves you. - What do you do? - Baggage handling. Well, taking classes. So want to go grab a coffee later or something? Need a ride home? Actually... - Actually sounds promising. - Thank you... ...but I can't. What happened to that promising actually? My friend's sick. Perfect. My bag's red. It's bright red. It actually... it matches this one... a big giant tag. Yeah, last flight in. Check back in the morning. Oh, here's one. Whoa. Wait, stop! Stop! Wait! Where are we headed? Your timing needs a little work. - No, it's not that far, really. - What's your destination? Downtown, but we're all good. And how much will that be? - Well, how much? - No clue what you're saying. Tell your friend to ask that driver how much to take you downtown. What are you doing? Standing in the rain like a fucking idiot. Matt, Matt, um... Let's take the shuttle. Seth, I just called my brother. - He's picking us up in 20 minutes. - Call him back. Ah, it's 2:00 A.M. I gotta be at work in six hours. Would you knock off the wallflower routine? It's $ 30 for both of us. I'll do it for half, smile included. "Last run of the night" discount. Please just wait one more second. Said he'd do it for $ 15? He's going downtown? I guess. Watch your step. The floor's slick. Airline lose your bag? - Hi. - Hi. - You ladies back from vacation? - Mexico. Did you break some hearts, cause some trouble? "Girls gone wild"? What is this, taxicab confessions? 64 to base, three on board. We need to be shuttled. Three stop limit, fellas. Take the next one. Yeah, we'll take this one. One, two, three on board. So you can just go ahead and keep your money. - That's great, prick. - Wait! Wait! They're with us. These, uh... these knuckleheads are with you? Where's home, moneybags? Actually, I'll drop them off after you drop us off downtown. Same stop. Yeah, it's up to you, but I... Well, I think the two of you could do a whole lot better. Leave your bags here. I'll take 'em. - Thanks a lot, man. - Yeah. You're welcome. Excuse me, are we leaving soon? Yeah, yeah, I'm doing my best, sir. 64 to base. Two additional. You remember Seth, don't you? How could I forget? And Matt. - So what happened to your rides? - Matt's brother totally flaked. - Unbelievable. - Yeah, unbelievable. The rebound. Have you tried ginger? Chinese herbal thing for motion sickness. You too? Planes, cars, boats. As a kid, even though I was in the bathtub. It did get me out of a lot of unwanted personal hygiene as a child though. Your boy makes friends fast. So does your girl. What? You realize you're never getting home tonight. Yeah, I know. Where the hell are we? I don't think he knows where he's going. Excuse me for asking, but... Where are we going? Uh, MLK Boulevard. I just left a third world country. I don't need a tour of the hood. Highway's down to one lane up ahead, from 12:00 to 5:00. It's a construction malfunction. What's wrong with 6th Avenue? Well, the first stop's South side. What's your point? I'll tell you what, princess, you just relax and let me do the driving. I've been delivering precious cargo like yourself for five years. I'll get you there with time to spare. Great. Our chauffeur is Dr. Seuss. He's right, you are a princess. That little girl in the baggage claim... So she's deaf, but she can do sign language already? Yeah... Children that are born deaf often can sign before hearing children speak their first word. It's not hard. Do you want to try it? Sure. What am I saying? Hi, my name is Matt. Is there such a thing as sign language speech impediment? Do one more. How're you doing? - Oops! - Son of a bitch! Sir... What the fuck? Is everybody okay? Nice detour. Gangbanger boulevard. Why are we stopping? - Why are we stopping? - I don't know. Sir? Sir? - Where is he going? - I don't know. What the fuck? He's... The... The back tire is flat. Great. Must of punctured when that nutjob ran us off the road. Why don't you take some responsibility for your choice in off routes? I've had just about enough out of you for one night. - Yeah, why don't you keep... - Seth, cool down, okay? - Don't make this worse than it is. - What do we do? Well, we got... We got two options... One, I radio dispatch and we... Well, we wait for another shuttle. How long will that take? Well, this time of night, an hour, maybe less. - Maybe more. - Yeah. Option two? Well, you sit tight while I change the tire. It'll only take a few minutes, even less if one of you just give me a hand. I vote option three... Call a cab. Sweet. No service. Look, the ride's comped, okay? There's no charge, and I... Look, I apologize for any inconvenience. What do you say? Sure. Um, I'm Melanie, by the way. Mel. Andy. Hi. Just Andy. Well, this is Jules, and he's Seth. My wife worries. I... I should've called when I landed, but... I didn't want to wake the baby. You know, I'm gonna go see if they need any more help. So, you're Mr. resourceful, huh? But you couldn't arrange a ride home from the airport? Yeah, well, Seth's a lot of things, easily dissuaded isn't one of them. Truth comes out. What about you? No ride at this hour? Where's this fiancee we hear so much about? Truth comes out. Michael was a lot of things. Faithful wasn't one of them. No offense, Michael was an idiot. Stand clear. Comin' in. Ah, this damn thing don't want to go. Let me give it a shot. You got talent, kid. Now, what did I do with those lug nuts? - Do something! - Jesus! Oh my God! Jesus! Get me something! I need something to tie it off! Now! Oh! Oh, fuck! - We need to get to a hospital! - Get him in the van! Let's go. Just hold on. Just breathe. Grab your arm and keep it up. How's he doing? How do you think he's doing, you incompetent fuck?! - Where's the nearest hospital? - It's a couple of miles... I think. - You... you think?! - Drive, okay? Just drive. Does he know where he's going? Jesus, just get us there in one piece! Why are we slowing down? Why are we slowing down? He doesn't know where the fuck he's going. Are... are we lost? Are we lost? Hello, are we lost? - Sir, where are we? - Sir? Sir? What the fuck?! Fucking guy. Oh, fuck! I'm gonna fucking kill this guy. - What the fuck is wrong with you, man? - Stop. - No, no... no, what the fuck? - It's fine, calm down. What the fuck is this guy's problem? - This guy's a fucking idiot! - You're not gonna get anything... Sit down... Or I will blow your head clean off your shoulders. Okay, we all know that you're under a lot of pressure right now, but we really need to get to the hospital... What do you want? Care to take a stab, rich boy? Money. Oh, you're smarter than you look. Is this for real? Real as it gets, princess. Now, in the back, all of you. Him too. Move! Take it. I've never seen you. I don't know you. - Just let me out. - If I were you, I would sit down, close my mouth, and try not to upset the incompetent fuck with the gun. Cell phones, give 'em up. Here's how this is going to work. The five of you will stay calm, not do anything stupid, no one will get hurt, and this'll all be over before you know it. Does that sound like a plan? Same way Matt didn't get hurt? I knew this guy was fucked the minute I saw him. Where is he taking us? Somewhere he can Jack us in private. This isn't private enough for you? I'm an accountant for Christ's sake. I have a family. I don't want trouble. - Something isn't right. - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Why doesn't he just take our money and leave us? 'Cause he's not stupid. He can't just rob us and let us go... not now. Why not? What's wrong with that? Well, for one thing, we've all seen his face. What, he's gonna off all five of us for cash, credit cards and jewelry, dump our bodies on the side of the road? Yeah, that makes sense. You think it was an accident that Matt's the one bleeding? He's the biggest out of all of us. He was the only real threat, and now he's not. - You do the math. - You want to do math? Shh! Here it is. This is about money. Everything is always about money. You watch. Maybe, but I am not waiting around to find out. Well, you need to chill the fuck out. He's right. We must remain calm. That's what he wants. Don't you get it? Every minute longer, every mile further, this is only gonna get worse. So what, you gonna jump out of a moving vehicle? One of us take a bullet so that you can run to wherever the fuck we are? We need to do something. Mel. Mel. I'll open the window, you figure out how to light it. Okay. Hey, what... What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Whoa! Open the window! It won't... It won't open! Jules, no! Don't. Where's the thing? Open! What do you want with us? You shouldn't have done that. Jules! You're gonna get us all killed. Stupid! Look, ah, I... Actions will have consequences. No no, please. Stand up. You too. Duck, duck... Duck, duck, goose. He'll live. Everyone got the message? Right. Change of plans. You okay? Nervous stomach. He'll let us go once he has his money. What? Say what you were gonna say. If you ever want to see your family again, you better grow some balls. I am not dying over a few hundred dollars. You're young, and stupid, and putting everybody in danger. She's right. We have to do something. Fire alarm, please, fire alarm. Please. Come on, come on, fire alarm. Come on, come on. Please, right now. Sneaky little bitch. Anyone moves, then someone will suffer. - No! - Open the door! Go fuck yourself! Now's our chance. Hey, wait, hey, hey! Haven't you done enough already, huh? Who do you think he's gonna punish next? Not her, not you. Me, okay? That's who's gonna be punished. You touch her again, and I will snap you in two. Fine, have it your way. Your friend is going to die. She will suffocate here and now... Unless you show yourself. What did I tell you? Let her go. What did I tell you? Don't do anything stupid and no one gets hurt. Breathe. Just breathe, okay? This must be where he's letting us go. You get that all out of your system? Nine items. Buy only what's on the list. Nothing more, nothing less. Walk in, find each item, go to the register, pay and walk out. You got it? Yeah. What I don't get is how any human being can do what you do. If you speak to anyone, if you try to communicate or draw attention to yourself in any way... This is gentle compared to what I will do to little miss firestarter back there. You have 10 minutes. One second longer, I will leave, and they will die. Put 'em on, both of you. Fasten your seat belt. His too. On your feet. Let's take a little walk. Where is he taking them? It won't come off. It won't come off! I know. Open them up. Take out anything valuable or personal... Jewelry, cameras, photos, IDs, medication. Valuables in the bag. The rest goes back in the luggage. How fast can you run? What? If I get us loose, he can only go after one of us. Are you insane? What about the one he catches? Mel was right, this is only going to get worse. It is what it is. This is fucked. I don't think I can do it. No, you can because you don't have a choice. When I say, you go that way, I'll go this way. And don't fucking puss out on me, or I swear I will beat your ass. Okay. - Cash or charge? - Here. You okay, hon? 74.95. Hey, you forgot your change! When his foot hits the pavement, you run like you've stole something. I've never stole anything. - Please don't kill me! - Don't make me. Motherfucker! No! What is this? Did I tell you to buy this? You see what happens when people don't do what I tell them? It's for him. What? It's for him, goddamn it! It's for him! 911. What is the nature of your emergency? What happened out there, Andy? Answer me, you son of a bitch. He ran. You didn't. Why didn't you run, Andy? Why didn't you run?! He'll let us go. He has to let us go. If we just do what he says. He doesn't have to let us go. He could just run us over in the road like fucking road kill! I didn't run because I was afraid he would catch me, and he would kill me. I didn't run either. In the store, I could've gotten away. I should've gone when I had the chance. Where are we going? Where are we going? Where are we going?! We're gonna die. We're gonna die. No, we're not. Ready. Do it. Help! Help! - Help! - Help! Help! Help! Let him go! I said let him go! Stay down! You even blink, it'll be the last thing you do. Keys to the seat belts, now. Give 'em to Jules. Do it. Now what? We're getting the hell out of here, that's what. What... What do we do with him? We leave him on the side of the road. Let the police worry about him. I say we shoot him... In the leg, and leave him in a ditch. What did you do to the radio? Get up and walk slowly to the door. I said get up! I need a doctor. You cut me bad. Tough shit! Like he doesn't? Your knife... Where is it? Hand it over. Shoot me if you want, but do it wrong and I'll die. Makes you a murderer. Either way, I'm not getting out. Oh, shit. All right, strap him in good. Gun to his head. I'll drive. Are you sure you can do it? I got him. - Don't even hesitate. - Uh... Jules, I want you here. He so much as flinches, you scream your head off. Okay. Is this what you do for kicks? Pick up random-ass people from the airport, drive 'em around, hack 'em up limb-by-limb until morning? Don't got shit to say now, do you? - Jules? - Yes? Please shut up. Look in the mirror. Foot off the gas. Pull over. Carefully. Turn off the ignition. Come on. Oh my God. What were you waiting for? What were you waiting for? I couldn't help myself. The human drama. She got you good. That's the price you pay for two unnecessary stops. You should've known about the knife. Girls are your responsibility, guys are mine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Then where were you when tough guy was busting my skull? He got his. Besides, I'm not the one who picked up the extra baggage. What about the luggage? Aspirin, birth control... Nothin' much. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Let's keep moving. So long as I get a taste before it's done. Buckle up. We are almost done running errands. Then it's time to put the joy back in "joyride." Unfortunately, because of all the detours, we won't have as much time together as I'd like. We'll make the most of it, huh? I do think creating the right expectations is key to every successful relationship. Take a closer look. - Huh, you like that? - No. Yeah. I'll interpret. Master. Servant. Me. You. And you. You and the boyfriend did a real number, huh? Yeah, must be some consolation though, now that he's lying in a pool of his own blood. Don't blame yourself too much though, you weren't the one trying to bust her hump to get him and the rich boy on board. Don't listen to him, Jules. He's only trying to get to you. - No! - Get off of her! No! Patience! You are next! Hey! Take it easy. That's enough. You're a monster. Honey, you can't even imagine. You are in for a real treat. Sometimes good things happen to bad people. Don't miss me too much. Where are you taking us? Here's a hint... It's not far, but it's dark and wooded, and once you go, you never come back. We should try cabo next time. It's supposed to be clean. Good beaches. Mel, what did we do wrong? We didn't do anything wrong. We sure as fuck did something wrong. We got on the wrong shuttle. I don't want to die. Jules, I want you to promise me something. If you get a chance to get away, don't hesitate, don't wait for me. Just run like hell. Promise me. You first. Okay. Okay. Oh... Sleepin' beauty's awake. You're kind of a bitch, huh? You can't even imagine. Please retain your original receipt for proof of purchase. Son of a bitch! Jesus Christ. - Take your foot off the gas! - No! Pull over! - No! - Pull over! Help! Please help me! Please help me! Please help me! Hey, miss, are you all right? Miss? Are you injured? Um... I'm going to put you in my car and take you to the hospital, okay? She's still alive. Who? Mel. But where? Yeah, I need to report an emergency. Uh, I think there's been an accident. I don't know. I'm with a victim... A young woman. Uh, no. No, I don't see any accident. Hurry up. She said someone's still alive. Tattoos... Either of you have any? You can tell me or I can look for myself. Fine, we'll do it the hard way, like everything else tonight. Wait. You have one? Yes. Just one? Where? It's... On my... Your ass? Go. He burned the shit out of me. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. We're getting out of here. Promise? It's a casket, isn't it? "Not far. Dark and wooded. Once you go, you never come back." I'm gonna get you some paper towels, okay? Oh, stop it! Stop trying to help. And stop telling me that it's going to be okay, because it's not and you know it. I'm sorry. Don't do that! The last thing I need is you apologizing to me. You wanted to go with Matt and Seth and you did it because of me. So this is your fault? At least you're not a liar, and a bitch, and an all-around sick human being. How do you know? Because you didn't fuck your best friend's fiancee. I wanted to tell you. You don't even know. It was just... One stupid night. I have been jealous of you... My entire life. How pathetic of an excuse is that? I knew. Well... I suspected. The way you looked at him. But, Jules, I didn't really go with you to Mexico to have one last girls' weekend before I got married. I did it to see if... You would tell me the truth about what happened with Michael. And see if we could get past it. I didn't want to lose you over some guy I don't want to see again. I guess it doesn't matter now, huh? Jewelry off. Anything pierced, lose it. Why are you doing this? Turns out rich boy was right... Everything is all about money. My father has money. I can get you money. How about $ 40,000... Okay, whatever you want. All right. ...a month. Don't believe him, Jules. No one does this just for money. Not for five years. You have to enjoy it. That is how long you've been delivering precious cargo, isn't it? You put that on. You hear me? Help her. You do it right, you do it fast... You clean up and you come out when you're done. I don't get it. Over here. Move. On the tape. Clothes off. Underwear stays on. Easy or hard, ladies. Toss 'em. Open them up. Put them on. Stand there and don't move. Turn around. Stop. Continue. Okay. Stay put. What do we do? I don't know. What are you thinking? There's two of us and only one of him. He'll kill us. You know he will. I can't imagine the sick twisted shit this bastard has planned for us. Four people have died since we got on that shuttle. I don't think... He won't hurt us. What? He can't. I mean that's... That's it! That's what he's been saying all night. He... He wants us alive and in good health. He tried to suffocate me! No. No, he was bluffing and I fell for it. I mean, Jules, look at me. Look, I don't have a scratch on me. Everyone who's on that shuttle is either dead or bloodied, except us... Both of us. He's been protecting us all night. Even your ass... I mean, he bandaged it, right? He'd only do that if he wanted it to heal. So he wants us alive. He wants us healthy. He only ever wanted us. That's why he didn't want anybody else in the shuttle. What are you doing? I'm getting us the hell out of here. This yours? Fluconazole. For what? Infection. What kind? What kind? Yeast infection. It's common. One last thing. You come with me. You stay here. Why can't we go together? Because I said so. You won't shoot me. You sure? Where are we going? Where are we going? No! Melanie! Melanie! No! No! Melanie! No! Melanie! No. No. You're no good to me all cut up. I finally figured that out. Do it and you'll end up like everybody else tonight. Put the gun down. You want to die like your friend? Put the gun down! Get back. Get back! There's nowhere to go. Shut up. Give me the keys. I'll do it. I will. Then you'll die. Plain and simple. Give them to me! That's twice you've cut me tonight. No! No! Let me out! Let me out! Help! Somebody please help me! Help! Help! Help. Help! Somebody, please! Manual corrected, synchronized, and spell checked by H@w-to-kiLL.
