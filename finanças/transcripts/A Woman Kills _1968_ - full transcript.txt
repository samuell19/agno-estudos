I'm not a man. I have no name, nor a place on this earth. I'm a... living wound. My mother made me who I am. A sadist, a deviant. I had the chance to be a man. They didn't allow me to be a man. They made me... the worst of the cowards. They pushed me into the abyss of the vice, of the crime, and of depravity.
