PC... Can you imagine when they announce "the settlement is ready"! I'd grab a big share over there... I'd like it to be over there, on the edge of that bush... It would be nice, wouldn't it? Can you picture how fancy I'd look up there? By now, it would all be covered with my crops, my cows... but I don't want any pigs! You would want that much land? You'd be a big landowner, then! Not really! So much suffering only to get 40 acres... What would I do with 40 acres? Oh, grandma, 40 acres! If we can't handle it, we'll end up starving, you know? I want to split this 40-acre area so I don't work too hard. There's much more to life, right? I think about the future. Here's one fence and here's another one. And here I wanna plant lots of... fruits, you know? Right here at the entrance. - P.C., you're stealing my idea! - No, I'm not! Aw, man! I wanna plant coconuts from Bahia, oranges, lemons... Everything at the entrance, I don't want it there. I'll put my orchard here. I really hope I get my share split with yours! I'm rooting for us to be neighbors. Yes, by God's will! Ain't it? It would be great, wouldn't it? I will always help you, whenever I can. Whenever I'm in trouble, I'll just scream, "Hey, partner, I need you!" You, me, and Clara will get together, and there we go. We can exchange work days, P.C. Yes, that's what I want, Grandma, to have some partners and take turns. Just like it used to be, we'd harvest rice, beans, then you could just say to your neighbor, "I wanna buy a pig, and don't have any money, but I do have two rice sacks, a bean sack." There's a passage here. In this case, if we receive those 40 acres, I wanna split it here... 15 here... this will be 15 acres. So, here we go. I'll chase my dream, you know... God bless, Grandma. To build my picket, I'll use 5 acres to plant roses, so I can make rose oil... Did you see how expensive it is? My friend... We'll be so happy, right, Grandma? Dear God, make this old lady's arms strong 'cause I'll work my ass off! And Grandma, imagine there are people who don't even wanna do anything in life! If I get a place with access to water, guess what I can also build... a fish... tank! Why is that? Using pipes, I can draw pig manure into the tank to feed the fish, through a pipe system. Right? Here's the henhouse. A henhouse. Here's the pigsty. Here's the stockyard. This is only for cattle, cattle, cattle too... and also here. The same here... And the fields will be up here, right, Grandma? You're wondering if it's only cattle. No, there'll be crops too! So, I'll plant corn, gueroba palms, and then... manioc, right? I'll plant manioc because it's food, I can make flour, powder, I can sell it... We have to think this through, you know? I wanna furrow the ground, I'll get a tractor to do it. There are tractors that work just like planters. Here, I won't plant gueroba palms, because it dries my soil too much, it draws the water out, you know that. I can plant a little bit, maybe four or five just to eat. But instead of planting gueroba palms, I'll plant... Eh... How's it called? Hearts of palm! But it's the same, it'll also dry the earth! No, I won't plant them here. I'll plant them down here, near the water. In eight months, I can cut them to sell the heart of palm... for a good price! And I'll plant rice, beans, I'll also have manioc... and corn! I'll try to produce two crops of corn and two crops of beans. Rice is not possible, 'cause it doesn't grow twice in a row. In the middle of all this I'll grow my coffee trees. I wanna grow coffee too. That's why I wrote "miscellaneous" here. I'll grow coffee Coffee is the most important! Yes, I'll grow it because a coffee sack is sold for 150 reais! Then I won't need to buy coffee for myself, 'cause I'll have my grinder, my roaster... And here I'll have my house, I'll build a big porch here... This will be surrounded, too. With a wood burning stove and everything! Here, a parking lot for when my children come visit, so they can park their cars. Yeah, very chic! I'll be this super stylish old lady! And I'll have a good horse to ride! That's great to visit the neighbors, just take the dirt road! If we get our shares here, I'll go to Santa Helena on horseback! I'll go get breakfast at your place, on horseback! You can go! And then, my friend, Little by little I'll come up with more stuff, I'll do everything I can think of... And I'll be there to help. I can't wait to get the land, so we can live in peace and help the others. Free ourselves from being enslaved. Me, I don't keep watch here from midnight to six, no way! I've kept watch by myself here, when it was the other one. Totally fine, actually! If you think well, one can be at ease here, 'cause if anyone climbs the stairs, we can feel it! The tower will shake, right? But it can be dangerous to stay here by yourself. We gotta have a lamp, a lantern. Why, it's better in the dark! A lamp for what, so people can see you? But if the invader steps into the trap he'll get caught. Yeah, for sure. Then we'll set off some fireworks, and people will come, so what's he looking for? He'll have to explain. Looking for trouble... He'll have to explain what he was looking for. How are things over there? Yeah... Right over there? - And near the fence down there? - There's nothing... Everything's clear. Our shift is almost over. - Thank God. - Look. There's nothing... Nothing, but imagine if someone comes sneaking from out there? We can't see someone sneaking in slowly, Grandma! And the cane's not that tall yet! But it's starting to grow, ain't it? Around here it's already tall, see? We'll have to clean the field, Grandma. We'll have to organize it with the discipline guys. We gotta cut it. We'll have to! LANDLESS You're here fighting for your rights, so this place cannot be empty. In cases like this, we can think of some alternatives to allow people to participate in the struggle for land, right? I'm part of the mass front collective, that does this initial work with the families, of proposing, explaining everything, answering questions, and inviting people for this life project of returning to the countryside. We're a social movement that fights for land, but also for social transformation, and for our rights, see? It's a new life project, which isn't exactly new. Maybe it's new for me, because I haven't lived in the countryside, but my grandfather and my family come from the countryside, right? I also come from the countryside. Do you know what an "agregado" is? We work there our whole life but nothing's ours, you know? You make a living out of that but you don't own it. - Just to eat. - That's exactly it. It's not the Landless Workers' Movement that gives land to people, what the movement does is to gather people to fight for land. Why did we choose this land? This land is owned by prominent people, so we get into the political world. How's that? The landowner is influential, so it'll draw attention. It won't be a hidden occupation. We have 13 big areas in the state that have already been indicated to be expropriated for land reform, we're only waiting for the president to pay. So we're gonna fight to pressure him to pay for them. For instance, if three of those farms were expropriated, it would be enough to settle all the landless families in the state of Goias. - Great. - Let's fight. Anyone else? I'd like to know what the required documentation is. The documentation? The movement makes a registration. The Institute of Agrarian Reform only registers people once they are settled. People think the Institute fights with us, but actually we fight to pressure them into expropriating and buying land for us! For us... So, for now, there's no register? The register now is with our movement. I don't know what my relationship with the movement will be, in terms of presence, you see? Because I work, my husband has a problem with one of his fingers. I have two kids, but I haven't found a place for them in day care, and I study too. So I'll try my best to be present here, you know? So I'm already making it clear to you guys, because when I can't come it's not a matter of not wanting. I'm a fighter, I come from the countryside, and we love to cultivate the land, I mean, my true wish is to have my own cattle and to grow my crops. To have my little piece of land and work peacefully, I really love it, it's a lot of life for me, it's also a dream I have. So I want you all to know that if I can't always be present, it's just because I need to work and struggle to finish my studies. I'd like to know how far we're going. Look, everyone wants to know where it is, guys. Everybody wants to guess! It's close to Anapolis. We talk about 100, 110 km, but it's no more than that. But it may be 30. Then it's half an hour from Anapolis, right? It may be only 30 km! But we won't discuss this in detail now, because we don't know everyone here yet. All social movements have rats... They turn up to find out what our strategies are, what we're planning to do, to take the movement down. This way! This way, brother! This way! That's it, come on, come on! Two lines! Two lines! Here, the way is free! The area is occupied, here! Come on, folks! BEWARE OF THE DOG DO NOT TRESPASS Come on in! Go on! Go in! There's more canvas to cover up over there. Has my mother gone to sleep? Gee, we'll have to wait for daylight. There's a river, there's water there. There are groups settled there already... Some people went all the way down with the cars, but we didn't have the guts! And Mr. Senator said hi. For God's sake, we're not allowed to cut a tree whatsoever! Not even to make marks, do you get it? You get it? Because that makes us look bad. It's to put the little stove. Where's the tent you're talking about? Mom, my tent... It's from there, to here, from here, to there. Yes, the exit and the entrance! The kitchen will be in the same room, and the exit will face the bigger house! Oh, this is real desire for land! Look at all these tents! Any names I didn't say? Which group? Fortaleza. It's 62. 62 people, Fortaleza group. She's powerful, right? What's the next group? Vilmar de Castro and The Valley... - Are there any representatives here? - Yes, here I am. How many people? All the members of the "Our land" group unanimously want to resist and to resist in the headquarters, if that's what the majority decides. They've also said they don't agree with vandalism in the headquarters, but if needed they are willing to put down trees and bridges, and are willing to take extreme measures. They don't wanna go back to the city or back home, they'll only leave for a pre-settlement. 51 members, and one only child who has told me, "Aunt Lu, count on me, I'm willing to keep resisting!" "Free homeland"! In our group, we have reflected, we have discussed... and we've decided to stay for the struggle, right? We're 43 people. No, not 43. 44, 45, 46. Three more have just arrived. Nine people and two children. "Olga Benario"! 23 people and... lots of ideas have been given here. Maybe mess with his cattle, burn grazing fields, silos and corn fields, release his cattle in the corridors, record all of their actions, if they block us, we'll block the road. Girl, no, for God's sake! Too violent! It's our group's terrorism! We fight for real, man! "United to win" has 38 adults and one child, and it's ready to resist opening fences, cutting down trees and blocking highways. 39 people? How many you said? 39. One child. "Peace Flag"! We'll be waiting for an answer from the government, right? That's what people want. Or maybe even bring the government here, some government representative... And we think we should be in different places at a time. The proposal would be that, for instance, one guy goes that way, the other goes that way... That's what they proposed. "Throwing Down Walls". The majority decided to go to the headquarters too, if we must resist there. - How many children? - Everyone. 31 people. Children? There's a bunch. "Liberty Sun" group. My group has 20 people, and all of them have agreed to stay no matter what. And the majority has decided to go into the headquarters. They also wanna go in there. "Free homeland"! We won't just set fires randomly, it' not like that. We have to organize, discuss, make plans, got it? So we can be clear about what we are doing. And we don't have to do this now, we don't have to set this in stone now, as if we'd put all that was said into practice now. There is still a lot to happen. According to what happens, we will ponder what to do. Still... This discussion helps to set guidelines to what could happen, right? Would our strength allow us to do all we've talked about? All the actions suggested by the groups? So we gotta balance... We need the masses, but the masses are very small now... We have few people. The best we can do is to summon people, call everybody and talk to people in a very realistic way, tell people they have to commit to come, and not only for a day. If they wanna come, they have to stay! It's not a weekend camp, this is a camp for us to conquer our piece of land. OUT WITH TEMER I'll get some water. Right. If you exploit my husband, you'll see! He's too thin! I'm giving him a 5,000-liter water tank! Now we can enjoy! I'll even water my plants! There's a man weeding the field very, very well, he's covering the unweeded portions with the weeded grass! What kind of job is this? Scattering leftovers without weeding anything! We'll have to weed the field all over again! When you have your own parcel are you gonna weed like this, brother? Aren't you ashamed? If you're too lazy, go away with your hoe, go home to sleep! - No! - Gotta work! He'll have to do it well! Besides the activities being planned for every day, we'll have to start taking bigger steps, for us to remain, from the perspective we've been discussing, to turn this into a real settlement! And then, we tend to think only about the positive results, but we gotta put our feet on the ground and consider all those possibilities! 'Cause depending on the next moves, maybe by the weekend, we might receive an eviction injunction again... We have to consider that scenario too! We can't wait until an injunction comes, depending on the results, to only then start thinking about our actions! Yes, we do have to worry, we really do. They can try to sabotage us, our activities. Or there might be some sort of provocation... Maybe the factory employees might do something or try to argue with us, and we have to keep our people cool, and avoid any trouble. These are hard times, right? Now one of the things we have to spread among our comrades, is that whether the land is granted or not, the scenario is resistance! And our strength is in our numbers, that is our correlation of forces. Mere registration does not accomplish resistance. It's not only about transforming this particular land into a settlement. But it's a political game that involves the whole process of criminalization that our movement has been suffering lately, right? We have to keep this in mind. If we had the strength to occupy this land a year ago with 1,000, or 1,300 people, we'll have to bring a significant number of people to the occupancy. It's like Beth said, if we don't have a good number of people, depending on the context, we might be reduced to the dust we see around us. Someone took their shoes off. Nobody's wearing shoes here, everybody's wearing flip flops... What's that smell? Duno. Isn't it the little bug that burnt? It stinks. That's why the lights went off, it fell inside the lamp. Oh, there was an insect barbecue in that lamp! I guess that beetle touched me, I can still feel smell it! It's Bento, he didn't wash his feet! We gotta find a way to go there and organize things 'cause we still have to plant the rest of the corn. Yeah... Isn't there a holiday one of these days? - Isn't there, Giovana?- Huh? - No more holidays?- I guess they're over now. Can I cover the pans, Ca? - Bugs might fall all over our food.- Ugh, many already did... We'll eat these leftovers tomorrow... Did you know that in Brazil everyone owns their own farm? Oh, yes! A farm! Mine is right here, in the city, in the middle of my kitchen. I just have to open my fridge. There I have my orchard... "Everybody" who? Who's got a farm of their own. She said everyone owns one. She said it's in each person's fridge, did you hear? Even the clothes I wear come from my farm. From my cotton plantations. Does everybody even have a fridge? In my farm, I even have a sugarcane plantation! And I love this farm called Brazil! If that farm's in the fridge, then not everyone has it, right? And they have the guts to say that on TV... I'm agro. Agrobrazilian! AGRO: Brazil growing strong and healthy See, Bayer produces genetically modified soybeans. We plant them, the soybeans grow, then you have to spray poison all over. Then we get sick and whose medicine we're buying? Bayer's! Only then, you will see our Lord has power. When you leave everything at the altar. Today we're reaching 7 days of prayer on behalf of the land, we've been doing this sacrifice of praying throughout the last nights, in the faith that only Jesus will give us this victory. We believe the Bible is the only true book. We pray to God because it's only through our faith that He'll answer our demands. Oh beloved Jesus, bless us in Your power, Hallelujah, Beloved Jesus you have been working with us, oh Lord! Hallelujah in the Judiciary System, our Sacred Father! Hallelujah with the lawyers. Hallelujah, Jesus, with the judges and the law people... Please go visit them tonight, Beloved Jesus! Speak into those hearts, oh King of Glory! Operate, oh Mystery God, so they can, oh Powerful Saint and Father, have their humble hearts touched with love... so they can see, oh Beloved God, that not only the big landowners need land to plant! Make them see, Beloved Jesus, that we've been trying... to have some portion of land to plant what we need to eat, and feed the city of Santa Helena! IMAGE I'm handing out just a few today. Without feminism...? There's no socialism! If the countryside doesn't produce? The city doesn't eat! If the countryside doesn't produce? The city doesn't eat! Hey, Santa Helena town! Rural workers are here, people! We are here with our healthy food production! And up ahead, you can see some of our work. We want to know what you crave: sugarcane or... healthy food without pesticide? I'm going to play my guitar. LEONIR ORBAK OCCUPANCY I'm a black singer. Let's bring healthy food to our tables. Here's the choice for you to make: Do you want to put cane on your table? Or food? This is our role, this is our job, Here you can see the work of the Leonir Orbak occupancy families, near the Santa Helena mill! A factory that owes 10 billion to the Santa Helena community! You have two options in front of the march! What are you taking home to your kids: sugarcane or healthy food without pesticides? You can make that choice. So, people, don't be scared, this is our work! This is the work done by the Leonir Orbak occupancy families! This is to show the Santa Helena community that we're alive... and we're aware of all that fraud! So we ask for a symbolic contribution. This is planted by us, without any pesticide, at the Leonir Orbak occupation. Look! Everything's organic! Soon, our children won't even have drinking water! That's what we're demanding, what we're against. We don't want to shut down the factory, we want it to keep running, but in a healthy way, that satisfies everyone. Okay? That's what we want. Please read this folder, it explains the process in details! Bento, Bento! Coriander, pepper, and onions. Repeat after me: There are no bandits there! There are working families there! There you have families that have a dream, people who dream of achieving something, to raise their kids properly and dream of feeding them healthily! LET'S PROTECT THE FACTORY, OUR CITY'S PATRIMONY You can make your choice! Rice blooms into bunches and beans flourishes, Corn in straw, heart full of love. The Federal Court of Anapolis... Eh... granted the adjudication of levied properties owned by the factory in favor of the Brazilian State. Nonetheless, the Santa Helena factory has appealed against the decision. Once the decision was passed on to the Superior Courts, specifically the Supreme Court of Justice, then that adjudication was revoked, based on the argument that acts of disposition of property owned by a company undergoing reorganization are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. The embargoes must be prosecuted and judged. But in spite of this fact, we must determine the validity of the adjudication that has been sentenced. There are today, more than 600 families encamped in a determined area, an area of 15 hectares. Those families produce food, vegetables. In the encampment, those families do studies, they go to school, they participate in the Santa Helena community. So what we demand in this specific case is that, in case this estate is sent for adjudication, and subsequently, for the purpose of land reform, this could be a leading case, and why is that? Because Santa Helena currently does not produce any food. It only produces sugarcane! With agrichemicals, by the way. It only produces sickness! And fraud! The Santa Helena factory is among the 10 largest debtors... actually, the group! The Naoum Group. It's a family, They are among the 10 largest debtors to the Brazilian government! Although we have to understand the social side of it... the Federal Government said the property would be assigned to land reform. That raised those workers' expectations, in the region of Santa Helena. If those 20 properties were to go to agrarian reform, it's legitimate that all the workers would expect land reform in the region, and the redistribution for that purpose. I respect the Pastoral Land Commission, which has been admitted as amicus curiae to make the Landless' defense, because they foresee the possibility that those properties might be considered for agrarian reform. But now we have to wait. We look at this kind of social issue very carefully, the judiciary system as a whole does, as well as all of us here. But we have to consider the importance of maintaining peace and order at the Santa Helena factory, so the litigation can run properly. It's not that I am supporting the debtor, not at all. Once the embargo execution exists, the execution law says we cannot determine the adjudication before the embargoes. Also due to the claim of debt expiration, and the possibility of payment in installments once the debt is calculated, I don't see how I could disagree with the trial judge, who is heading the litigation for the company's reorganization. Right now, from what I can see, we were all in favor of those people who want to have access to the land, who want to produce and bring development to the region. But, at a second moment, this social awareness that makes us want to help those in need, must to be submitted to the law. I think Your Honor uses the same mechanism when judging this case. And here, as Your Honor has put so well, even if there was no judgment related to the company's bankruptcy, even in the Federal Justice, this adjudication would not be valid. Thus, as Your Honor has highlighted, there is a need for the judgment of the embargoes to be depleted. Because while there is no seizure decision, there is no way to know if the debt really exists! At least, technically. So when we add those two reasons, and those items we have gone through, it is painful for me, I admit, to say that we don't see agrarian reform there. So we are subjected to the law and the court order, and must overcome our wish that things were different, and that we could be redistributing land, if we could have a decision that would allow the distribution of that land to the Landless Workers Movement, to the people settled there, right now. "Encamped" for the moment, not actually "settled". But for those reasons, I cannot vote differently from Your Honor, just as endorsed by Dr. Mauricio. This is my vote, Your Honor. This trial is now over. Thank you everybody. Let's continue our agenda. Is there another one? Number 112. This is a matter that has been going on for years... It was sort of expected, and later on, we should evaluate that. We never expect to accomplish much in terms of land reform in the judiciary system. Not even from the legislative or the executive, it's very difficult. It's a whole other fight that we must always have to conquer those spaces and achieve something from those arenas. It's not easy to analyze those legal terms they use, you know? It's very hard to digest what they say. First of all, they don't use everyday language. You know, while we listen, we sit there, totally spaced out... We feel bad, because we are in front of a judge with all those big words and everything. Afterwards, in order to adapt it in a way our people can understand, we need some strategies. We do have to explain things, even if it takes a long time. To the older people, for whom it's harder to understand... we must take our time to explain things to them. To that little old lady, it's them we need to talk to! No need to talk to those who already understand. Because the ones who can use fancy words, legalese or whatever, or even politicians and religious leaders, they have that advantage, while we're doing the opposite, regarding our people's emancipation. In spite of all difficulties, those who will really get the message across are the coordinators. For instance, Eremilton is the one who knows how to speak to his base, so he should do it. Not me, I don't live here! Of course I can talk, but the doubts will stay even after I'm gone. Who is going to clarify their doubts every day? I analyzed the judge, while was speaking. He said he isn't defending a factory that commits tax fraud, he emphasized it, made it very clear. He also said the factory has been under bankruptcy process for 10 years, and there will be an assembly about that for the first time. So no one knows what's coming next. If it's never happened before, we can't guess what's gonna happen. And he said he wouldn't judge the case because we also have bills of review. And this is also something we can't explain, what are these review bills? Does it have to do with our mates who have been arrested? What does this mean exactly? This is something the people from the law sector will be able to explain. But so far he hasn't judged our case but hasn't judged theirs either, so it's kind of balanced. But what we can understand very clearly is that it's not over yet, that we're not going to leave anyway, like our mate said, and the game is still on. The case is still ongoing, let's hold each other's hands... But we can't let people's dreams die. So I think it's fine and tomorrow we'll keep fighting. And this is our struggle! I'm solid! I'll only move from here directly into my share! By God's will, yes! Fight! To build people's agrarian reform! Fight! To build people's agrarian reform! Fight! To build people's agrarian reform! Free homeland! We will win! Free homeland! We will win! Free homeland! We will win! Rebellion is necessary! To do the land reform! Rebellion is necessary! To do the land reform! Rebellion is necessary! To do the land reform! Even if it gets tough! This land is ours! Even if it gets tough! This land is ours! Even if it gets tough! This land is ours! Good morning, fellows. My voice is not very good today, but I'd like to pass on the news we have brought from there. Let's welcome our visiting comrades who came to contribute today, thank you for being here. Also all the other relatives who came here today, I can see many family members here, you are all very welcome. So I guess we'll start with the coordinators' understanding of the situation. About the judicial matters, we'll have some answers later on today. How much is there here, 250 grams? Around that. You have to chop it all up. This is good for long, thin leaves, you know? So it's good for grass, it's good for pastures... Oh, so each of these recipes is for a particular type of leaf? Yes. It's no good for round leaves. After it's ready, it's 1 liter of this solution for each 10 liters of water. Then you can spray it. - It's great for pasture! - So this will be enough for 80 liters! No... Oh, ok, yes. - 8 liters for 80 liters of water! - That's it. You can throw it on the field before planting the grass. - Just pure cabbage? - Yes, only cabbage. Just cabbage with water. It's a crop desiccant. Hmm, alright then. Organic desiccant... - It's the same as Roundup herbicide. - Cabbage desiccant! Let's write it down here... I guess we can already close it now. Is the lid around? We'd need a stick to stir it? So, all of you present, all of us actually... - Stir it every two days? - We'll have to be very careful, so that no one opens it or throws it away! Just write it on a piece of paper, P.C.! Write, "Do not open"! Or, "Open once every two days". Ok, let me see. Every two days, right, Grandma? Cabbage desiccant... organic. No need to write "cabbage", just "organic". We're the only ones aware of it! So, it will be ready on the 21st... What day is today, the 1st? Ok. It'll be good by the 21st. I've planted some tobacco seeds... Hey, lacemaker woman... Hey, lacemaker woman... Teach me how to make lace, I'll teach you how to work. Woman from the Northeast, Get the laundry to wash. Hey, lacemaker woman... The day I grab my parcel, I'll have so many water hoses! Drip irrigation and all! There's an entrance to the patio here and here's a big barrier. One barrier here and another one here. A barrier here, another here, and a big gate here. - How many gates are there? - Only this one. The heavy trucks pass by here and the small cars go through the barrier. The carts also go through here. - P.C.? - Yeah? There's a gate here, right? Only here. This one here is for trucks? Yes, this is all for trucks. For this action to be effective, we gotta stop the factory. If we don't, the media won't come. So it's right here. And we must be prepared for the repression. Out with Naoum Group! Out with Naoum Group! Out with Naoum Group! Out with Naoum Group! SANTA HELENA FACTORY Out with Temer! Go, go, go! Out with Naoum Group! Out with Temer! No trucks will go in or out, but people are free to go out. We're the people who aren't afraid to fight! We're the people who aren't afraid to fight! We're the people who aren't afraid to fight! If you can't cope with the ants, Don't mess with the anthill! If you can't cope with the ants, Don't mess with the anthill! Be on your toes, If you can't cope with the ants, Don't mess with the anthill! If you can't cope with the ants, Don't mess with the anthill! This factory is ours! Do the land reform! There is nothing to fear. Those who order to kill, might as well end up dying! The risk taken by the stick is the same as the risk taken by the axe. There's nothing to fear.

Where's mom? She's inside. Just call her. - It's so cold. - Do you want a coat? - Want some coffee? - A little bit. This is your first time here, right? Yes. When I came here the shed was down there, I hadn't seen this one yet. Some time ago, I was having lunch with the girls, so, I was eating, and they said, "Look, your dad!" I said, "What, where?" They said, "There, on TV!" I was like, damn! Doing those things at the factory. I was like, damn! - You saw that? - I did! I still haven't seen it. I didn't see the recording. - Was it any good? - Yes, it was. Lots of people, right? One of these days, the people from the factory authorized the minister to hold service, and they invited us. In the factory? Inside the factory! The coordinators were like, "No, we won't put our families at risk." God knows what they can do, sabotage or something. Then we found out they were planning on doing something to mess with us. These days I heard someone talking about the eviction and stuff. How's that for you here? No, it's all good here. We're not too concerned about that. If there is an eviction injunction, we'll just resist. But there's a lot to happen in the case, there's an embargo in Goiania... There might be embargoes in Anapolis, Rio Verde, or Jatai­, or Catalao... If the case comes back here, the local judge will concede yet another injunction... Then our lawyers will take it to the Supreme Court and try to block it again. All I know is that we're going to fight for many years ahead... - Hey, girl! - Hi! - How are you? - Good. I've missed you. You came to see us! What can I do? I think it's time to have our meeting. Isn't it on Wednesdays and Thursdays? Wednesdays and Saturdays. Good ones. Very good. What do you talk about in the meetings? It's normal, like they used to be. But it has changed a lot now, William. Because we used to talk about everything, right? Like discipline... Yeah, discipline, religion, education... food, coordination, health... Oh, he's funny! You know everything, you have to come live here! Well, I've lived here for many years. We need activists! You know everything. He remembers, I thought he had forgotten all that! Of course I do, how couldn't I? You can be the youth coordinator! How do you call that sector that'll be added to the youth sector...? LB... LG... LGBT. LGBT Yes, that's it. And that other boy asked him to join the youth section and the LGBT group. Yes, Julio. But he didn't want to. Julio, the one who he used to stay here. Sure, it would suit him! Travel somewhere for some training... Maybe even abroad, right? No, but it's hard for me, dad. But you don't have to pay for it. The government will, or maybe even the movement... But it's hard because of my job. It's complicated. "My job"... I can find a job for you, with a contract and all! I don't think I could work with a contract... Why don't you do it? Take some free time to work with a contract! But I already work, there's so much on demand here. I'm self-employed, my friend! I work for myself! I call him and I ask, hey, ain't you coming to the camp? Then find some good work to do! I work every Monday, right? Then, they changed my work days, They wanted me to go on Saturdays. So I told the girl, "Oh, no, I can't come on Saturdays." She said, "Why, do you work?" I said, "No, I go to the Landless." "Are you a member of the Landless?!" I said, "Well, I have some friends there, I like it so much, girl!" And what did she say? She said, "Really?" So I said, "I like it, we drink coffee from the same cup, eat from the same plate, share cigarettes..." "So on Saturdays I don't like to work, I like to go to the camp." There's no need to mix things, right? Involving work... There's a lot of prejudice, right? Society... It ignores us. Yeah, it really does. I take it from Sorlane. When she found out I was at the camp, she went to my place and I told her, super happy, "Sorlane, I'm joining the Landless, and so on." At the time I used to do manicure, I quit to come here. She was like, "What the hell, Aline?" I said, "I'm part of the Landless", "I registered and I'm part of it now. I'll stay there, it's great." Then she looked straight in my face and said, "God forbid, I don't even like landless people! To me, our friendship ends right now!" I was like, "Wow, Sorlane, are you serious?" She said, "Our friendship won't end because I know you, but I hate the Landless." I was like, "Alright." But since that day, we haven't talked, I never reached out anymore. You could have asked, "Do you own land?" Yeah. "No? So you are landless! That's your identity." Isn't she ashamed to say that? This is heavy! Be careful there. That's it. DANGER AREA Dilma, I always build my tent on my own! I build and rebuild it. This is what's left from the tower we did in the mockup, right? - You did the mockup, right? - Yeah. Go! It goes into the hole. Watch the hole there. Did it fall? - Help! - Hold on! Right in my face! Hold on! Turn it around. It looked like a piece of steel, like a can, you know? It passed real close to Micael, and he started jumping and screaming. And I started laughing at him and said, "Micael, come inside, leave it". Oh, my dear Lady! No joke, it was so close to him, it could have hurt him. But it was nice, wasn't it? The rain. God, no, I was scared! At first it was just wind, but then it was actually rain! I saw it put down so many stalks... In my area, half was down. A tree fell right on my area. It cut my tent in half. I only noticed the tower wasn't there the day after. At the entrance, I was like, "Where's the tower?" So a comrade said, "Didn't you see it falling?" And I said, "No, I just noticed it's not standing." I also didn't notice. Then, I came this way riding my bike. It was that day I went to the house of the minister's sister. That's when I saw it on the ground, and thought, "That's weird". And my tent had totally fallen down. I looked at those trees in front of my tent, some of them were twisting with the wind, like this! I was so scared my tent would fall. And imagine the wind, girl... Yes, some people's canvas fell, the flags were gone, some tents were gone like this, with the wood and all! Mine too. I almost thought I'd be gone with my tent, but I wasn't! - But it took a lot of things away! - It did. It did a lot of damage. It ripped things off. It's all part of life. What do you plan on doing there, Bento? I'm marking it, then I'll go down and you can cut it. I think it's gonna be good now, minister... Yeah... Anyway, we won't take shifts here anytime soon. That one just eats! Just sharpening his teeth on the canebrake! - That one likes it, huh? - He does. I was saying, Grandma, I left the factory and walked down the avenue. Then I see a bunch of people. I was like, "Man, has someone died? Then I saw some comrades and asked them, "What's going on? Has someone died?" And they said, "No, it's just the Landless movement!" And I was like, "What is that?" It was right when Lula won the election. So... They explained they were making some registrations for people wanting to fight for a piece of land. They were registering people to occupy a certain area. They asked, "Aren't you interested?" So I was like, "Yes, okay." Then I went in, where the coordinators were doing grassroots work and registering people. So I registered, and they said when the meetings would be. There were three meetings. They were doing grassroots work with 680 families. So I turned to Clara and said "I'm joining the Landless Workers!" "Are you crazy, join the Landless?" I had quit my job in the factory, and she was like, "But what about next year?" Well, next year, we'll be with the Landless, We'll grab a land. And she was like, okay. Oh, we have an illusion that it's gonna be fast! Then, on February 23, 2003... Yes, that's right. We were there occupying. I said bye to Clara and left. I didn't even know where! The road was full of cars, and they stopped near the asphalt road. I only heard the fireworks, pow, pow! Let's go! Everyone in the cars, one after the other towards Rio Verde, and so we went... I was thinking to myself, "God, where is it?" There was some booze, so we had some. And we arrived at the place. We stopped at the road, just like here, at the highway, some people already got into the farm. The grass was this tall! And the guy comes in with the truck, pressing, and pressing... There was an incredible wall of grass in that farm! There were so many trucks. Then I was like, "Man, it's a jungle! We won't be able to clean this!" He said, "Yes, we will! Then we started to organize, we had our hoes and all. Some went to sleep, some started building tents, all in the dark, no flashlights. So we improvised a bonfire, and we started working during the night. All you could hear was the sound of the hammers. I'm new in this occupation thing, but I have been through so much... A lot. When we left the Ema farm, after the 48-hour period, we were told to go back, "Pack your stuff"! When we arrived... That day, P.C... I thought I couldn't manage... It wrecks us, right? No! Wrecks us? I don't know what got into me, it must have been a crazy impulse! Then the boy turned on the sound as loud as possible. And lots of people, because at Ema, there used to be like 3,000 people, 700 were living there. Yes, a lot of people. He turned that volume up, and I was drinking... At the time I was a big drinker, huh? I said, "Josias, isn't that the police's headlight?" He said, "Yeah it is". He just whistled. I never saw so many men coming out of those bushes, just like monkeys! And the police came. Just one car? One?! They don't come with only one car! Jose Reginaldo, Jose Wellington, Lucas Leonardo, Manoel Santana, Marcela Alves, Marcio Gomes, Maria Aparecida, Maria Helena, Thiago Caetano, Wanderlei Barbosa. Did I miss anyone? Our journey's motto from now on is: "Crooks, give our lands back ". And where we're going, there are other people like us, from other parts of our region. It's important that this works as a formative moment, to share our experiences, to find out how the Landless groups work in other states, how they organize themselves, how the camps and the struggle for land are going. We'll stay together. We'll interact in all possible ways, but we have to stick together and pay attention to something called information security. So all those phones ringing right now, with which we're talking to other people, we won't post selfies saying, "Look, we're here, and so on." Because our action has been organized and we have a team responsible for creating those posts and images, and we'll be able to make them go viral anyway we want. So, starting now, we'll stop using our phones. The ones who'll keep their phones on are those we'll communicate with about the gathering points and the arrival situation. Tomorrow, again, we'll protect our militants. It's a hostile environment. With the coup right now, we know that we're getting involved with mean and extremely conservative people. So we have to protect our security as individuals and also as a group, and the information spread from now on. So let's avoid talking about what we don't know or haven't seen, and let's stick together. That's it. Free homeland! We'll win! Free homeland! We'll win! Once again! Free homeland! We'll win! Keep it down! Go under it! You can pass through here. Careful, people are passing under it. We'll manage to stop agribusiness here in Mato Grosso. Even if it's just a little. All the grain goes through here, and petroleum too. Really? So it won't pass over... Petroleum and grains, right? It'll send a good message. This is to send a message to those crooks in power! We're not playing camp here! The people want land to work! And that shameless man has all this land all to himself! And they don't pay any damn taxes. And we are here, fighting for our rights. RAILROAD CROSSING STOP, LOOK AND LISTEN AGROBUSINESS IS GENOCIDAL Landless! Free homeland! We will win! Free homeland! We will win! Free homeland! We will win! Rebellion is necessary! To do the land reform! Rebellion is necessary! To do the land reform! They killed Che, but they didn't kill his legacy! The Landless Movement grows every minute! Landless! Land reform when? Right now! Fight! Do the land reform for real! Fight! Do the land reform for real! Excuse me, please, can I have a word? What time did you arrive? How was the invasion of this property? Actually, it's not an invasion, it's a land occupation. We have arrived here around 5:30 am. How many families arrived here? Around 500. - 500 families? - Yes. What are these families demanding? The goal of this occupation is to denounce everything that's happening in our country. - Are we allowed to get in? - No. - We can't get in? - No, you can't. Only until this point? It's for our own security. Not even to show the movement a little better? No, not now, maybe in the afternoon, tomorrow, but not today. How long do you intend to stay here? It depends on how much dialogue we can have with them. So, these are concerns that are being presented by these people. There are around 500 people here, according to the movement. They occupy this property, owned by the Minister of Agriculture, Blairo Maggi. They present critical opinions on the current situation of our country, which they put into words of protest. Let's hear the families. This struggle is for real! This struggle is for real! So this is part of the national movement, right? Yes, it's part of the national Landless Workers' Movement and La Via Campesina. And you're here today because it's the Rural Producers Day, right? Yes, it's the Rural Producers Day, so we decided to do this land occupation, so we can establish the agrarian matter from a general point of view, and most of all we want to denounce this situation, right? All the law reforms happening in our country right now, this sort of sweep kick they are doing and what our workers are suffering. At the same time, we chose Blairo Maggi, the current Minister of Agriculture, and also a senator. In this state, he owns many properties, and he is also one of the largest soybean producers. So we keep seeing the countryside being destroyed, poison and agrichemicals all around, and to seek equality in Mato Grosso now is to seek agrarian reform. Because land is a source of power. This is how we see agrarian issue, and this is why these people believe in the Landless Movement, and fight for agrarian reform. This is the spot that leads to the railroad that has been blocked by members of the Landless Movement, this morning in Rodonopolis. When I tried to get closer to the entrance, I was intimidated and even threatened by the members of the Landless Movement. They had batons and wood sticks. What that lady is holding is a kind of baton, and she is there as a sort of guard to watch the farm's entrance. I am asking, my company is asking, for the repossession, according to the law. I won't do anything arbitrary. But it is a shame, really. We got a call this morning with information that these invaders were here. We came right away and talked to the leaders, to keep everything in order and avoid using violence. I hope that when they get what they want, which is to draw the media's attention to the problems they say they have, they leave and let the families who work at the factory and the property go back to normal. Brazil is the fifth most unequal country in terms of access to land. Only 1% of rural properties concentrate about 45% of all arable land. Most of it is occupied by agrobusiness, and many areas remain unproductive. Despite being responsible for over 70% of food production in Brazil, family agriculture occupies a small part of the territory. Since it was founded in 1984, the Landless Workers' Movement (MST), one of the largest popular movements in Latin America, has contributed to the settlement of over 350,000 families. By the time this film was finished, there had been no progress in the Santa Helena case. On December 2018, two members of the Leonir Orbak occupation were sentenced to 7 and 14 years in prison, on charges of conspiracy. The occupation resists. Elected president in 2018, former serviceman Jair Bolsonaro promised to facilitate access to heavy weaponry, for big landowners to fight the landless. With support of the "beef" and "bullet" caucus in Congress, Bolsonaro promised to end all activism and define protests for land and housing as terrorism. Among his first measures as president, he transferred the National Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCRA) to the Ministry of Agriculture, led by the large landowners' lobby, and issued a decree facilitating the purchase of weapons. Since 1985, the Pastoral Land Commission has recorded almost 2,000 deaths in land-related conflicts. More than 120,000 families live in Landless settlements today. This film is dedicated to them.
