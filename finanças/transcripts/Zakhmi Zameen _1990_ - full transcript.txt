Every land in this village should belong to me. In spite of knowing this you've returned without procuring... ... Madhav's thumb print on these papers. You know that i either want yhe thumbprint of the man... ...or the thumb of the man... ...who refuses to give his thumbprint. Thakur... ...when i killed Nathuram and... ...procured his thumbprint on the papers... ... i was imprisoned for theree months. rhree months! That is when you had told me... ... that if matters can be solved with violence... ...then you dhould not cause bloodshed. That's why i've let him live.Yes! But if you give the word... I'll get Madhav's... ... thumbprint drenched in his own blood. I want a heap of such papers signed... ...so that i can build a magnificent villa on those lands... ...which will be the eighth wonder of the world. Taj Mahal wherein the arms... ... of the artisans were chopped off after it was constructed. Similarly... ... i do not care if we have to spread a barrage of corpse as... ...foundation for this villa. We're already facing oppression and to top it off we're facing famine. They have us now! We are done for! Villagers are doomed by these two. They are leaving this village like stray dogs. The only thing they fear is the old Mauni Baba. If he says that it will rain in ythe village... ...then it will definitely rain Bhairav. It will rain if that old man speaks up. Before that old man talks... ...i will chop off his tongue Lala! But Bhairon if you cause a delay in chopping off his tongue. Then this deserted village will be resettled once again. I said do not go! Do not leave this village! You are abandoning this village because of famine. But leaving this village won't change your destiny. Prabhu do not go! For God's sake do not turn away from mother earth! Madhav we can bear anything... ...but we cannot bear to see our kids starve. Uncle Madhav! Uncle Madhav! Will we get food? -Yes dear. We will get food. That is why Mauni Baba... ...has been fasting so that we do not starve. Do you trust Mauni Baba enough to say that it will rain? Yes i do. My sister it is my belief. Its because of this belief that Mauni Baba... ...has not eaten for the past ten days. Mauni Baba believes that his faith can change God's destiny. So join me! Join me in praying to God... ...so that our prayers... ...can ripple through the skies and reach God. Pray so that God cries. He feels the emotions and cries. And God's tears fall to the ground like rain. Say it! Say that it will not rain! -Bhairav! He will not talk. He will not talk. He will talk! Even his father will say that it will not rain. If you say that it will not rain... ...then the villagers wil desert this village. Bhairav... ...and my dream will come true. We will build a magnificent villa on that land. We will even give you a room. You can pray that comfortably. Come on say that it will not rain. Come on old man! You won't say it? Say it! Bhairav! Bhairav! What are you doing? You are crudhing the head of a great saint against a rock? You've spilt so much of his pure blood? Why are you being own enemy? Why? Just say that it will not rain. Just say that it will not rain. Say that it will not rain. Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! -Stop Thakur! I will make him talk! Talk! Say that it will not rain! Fool! Say that it will not rain! Say yhat it will not rain! O God! O Lord! O Almighty! Say it! O God! He will die this way! It will rain. It will definitely rain. Thakur Pratap Singh! Look! It's raining! You have traumatised this land by murdering Mauni Baba! But remember... ...that i'll never let your dreams come true. You'll never be able to construct your sinful villa on mother earth. You have deceived people under the pretext of decency. Today i have come to rip off that mask... ...and show your true colours Thakur! I will yell! I will scream! I will tell people that you murdered Mauni Baba. You are the murderer! You are a killer! Shabbir! Shabbir! Go throw this dog in a play where we cannot hear his bark! Sister! Sister! I am a brother to you. But no girl in this village is willing to be your sister-in-law. Get me a wife sister! Yes brother! I have given this much thought and picked a girl for you. Her name is Hasina. Sister what about this? Oh no! As soon as i am awake i saw the face of an unfortunate wretch. Today I will not get food. Oh Chickoo! -What is it? Tell your Majesty to prepare two hundred eggs two.. ..hundred chapattis(bread) thirty goat and forty chicken. He is awake and hungry. He will eat breakfast. Oh Uncle!Tell your daughter.. ..that someday I will slap her so hard.. ..that her dentures will fall out in her youth. She is enjoyed that sugarcane up there. Come down!She will fall down! Am I a kid? You are a kid! Even your dad and the rest of the family is a childish! Your dare call me a kid! Cock-eyed! Have you ever laughed in your life? -Hey! You are over doing it! Did you ever laught?? -Go on! Go on! Go on! -Enough dear! Enough! Why are you arguing with her in the morning? I am worried that after marriage if you both.. Marriage? With this fool? You marry him! Not even you get him married to Hasina! I will get you married to that illiterate guy! - Enough! Mangal forget her. Listen to me. Go to the city and get some seeds. Tomorrow when Radha makes the fertilizers.. ..she will add your seeds too. We have had a good monsoon this year. God willing we'll have even better crops. -Yes i will go. Boy hold this! Did you hear him clearly fool? You need to get seeds.. ..not the enter grocery shop the way.. ..Lord Hanuman got the entire mountain. Shut up and do your work! Else you will be thrashed! Get lost! Mangal you'll not get the seeds available at Milawatram.. ..anywhere else.Got it? Keshav! Give Mangal original seeds. Lord Milawatram! If you any adulteration with Mangal.. ..I will not leave you capable of anything. Do you understand? Kid! Take the responsibility that uncle had entrusted me. Why are you throwing it? Can't you hand it over? You've brought it for yourself. You are not indebting me! Yes I am! For the first time in your life you've done the right thing. Champa! Shalu! Look! Mangal the great has got seeds. When will you learn? Will you ever do anything right? Have you got seeds or an empty head? If you act smart I'll break your wrist. Got it? You cannot break my wrist! Then go and break the wrist of the grocer.. ..who gave you face seeds. Mangal ! Come! Come! Come on in! Lala.. ..it seems your mother knew that your blood is adulterated too. That is why she named you Milawatram (Adulteraded). It is my duty to do adulteration. Scoundrel! How dare you deceive Mangal! Fake seeds? All my men are worthless! They do not know who should be given what! Ramu! Shamu! Kalu! Dhanna! Where are you all? Come here! Come here! Dear Mangal does not even know.. ..that the human bones are the best fertilizers. Dhanna! Fool! Beat him! Thrash him! Beat him! Go on! He's come here again! Come on Lala! Stand up! Why are you yelping in hiding? Get out and yelp! O God! O Almighty! O Almighty! Protect me! We willl build a beautiful house. Why are you trying to pease me today? Seems like you've got the thumb print of some farmer and come. I would not have minded if it was a thumbprint. Instead he showered my face with blows. Shower of punches! Thakur i am done for! I will not live long! My bones are crushed and my blood has become thin as water. Mangal the scoundrel has beaten me black and blue! I was foolish to give him adulterated seeds. What did you give him? You know that I want them to abandon this village. Yet you are empowerring them by providing them seeds! I want to send Lulla to the city.. ..so that he can become an architect and fulfil my dreams. And you are providing them seeds! I will strip his skin off! You are listening to that cheap boy.. ..and asking me to keep silent? If we become silent.. ..then in future the rest of village will.. ..scream along with Mangal too. Your dream and my job will be crushed by that scream! Thakur please try to understand. If there is a murder in a small village.. ..then there is trouble for everyone. You have killed Mauni Baba. Made Madhav disappear. I need to answer people too you know! Strike only when the iron is hot. What happened kid? Why are you crying? Will you tell me or just continue to cry? I have a scorpion on me. Scorpion! Scorpion! Fool! This is a fake scorpion. You are scared for no reason. Go on! Go and play! Get lost! Scorpion... Every morning she tortures me. She calls me lazy. Today i'll teach har a lesson that she'll always remember. Give me my scorpion. I will tell her! Lazy fool has woken up! He will do his breakfast! Two hundred eggs and two hundred parathas(Fried bread). You are enjoying this aren't you? Why are you crying? Shut up! Look! Look at this! You are scared of a fake scorpion. Mangal!

"Sing with me beloved. Sing with me." "I dance vigorously." "This maddening wind seems like calm waters." "Your anklets jandling are causing us to have fun."

"Do Re Me." "You dance vigorously." "What your heart spoke to my heart." "That is what my heart spoke to your heart." "What your heart spoke to my heart." "That is what my hear spoke to your heart."

"You make me dance." "Sing with me beloved. Sing with me." "Do Re Me." "I dance vigorously." Look brother let me explain. Our villa will be built on the land.. ..from this farm to here. But dear.. ..will the villagers give you their land? -Shut up! You always talk rubbish! If they don't give it up we will steal it from them! Why are you scaring me? I am frightened! You seem to scare me every time. Can you see this here in the middle? He's trouble and his name is Mangal. He'll not sell his land.. ..not will he let anyone give their land up. Do one thing Lala. - Yes? Take this home and play with it like a toy. - Yes... We cand build this villa only.. ..if this entire land belongs to us. Hey Radha! Hey Radha! Mangal you are tired aren't you? - Yes. Then hurry up wash your hands and eat. Take this. Will you keep staring at me or eat as well? Why? Won't you feed me? Uncle! Are you still her? Banna is calling to the farms! Banna is calling me and yet you heard him. I did not hear him. There are lot of potholes here. Come here.Come this way. Look! It's such a beautiful place. Look at those mountains! We have bought all the land on both sides of that hill. -Ok. Only these two farms are remaining . We'll buy them too. Then you can start your work. -Lulla! Lulla listen up! What do they call it... Swimming house! Yes swimming house. He is talking about the swimming pool. Lala it's called the swimming pool! - Yes the swimming pool! My house should be next to that swimming pool. - Ok. Will you look at it from your window? You have definitely found beautiful land. The people are nice too. There are other nice people too. Sit here. Come sir. - Yes sit down here. Ok. Now you go from here. Should i get some cold water? We do not want anything. Go away! Ask how musch money these beggars want. Hey! Whom are you calling a beggar? I called you a beggar. So what can you do about it? How dare you call me beggars? It's not your father's land! Had we come to you to sell the land? Why did you call us beggars? Tell me! How dare you? Is it your father's land! Why are you getting excited? -Tell him! Else i'll bury you here! Radha! Move aside! Control yourself! -Why create problems? You move aside! He is calling us beggars! Did we go to his home to beg? Let us go ! Come on! Showing the strenght of your money? Want to buy my land? Get lost! If you ever return I'll bury you in the same land. Why are you getting involved with those people! They are rich folks. So what if they are rich uncle! Do we go to their home to beg? He is calling us beggars! It wasn't right for you to bear enmity with junior Thakur. What are you saying? Should Mangal agree to what Thakur and Thakur junior said? We will have to agree. We do not have an option. He is not only our.. ..provider but the provider for this entire village. Mangal's land is his mother. Mother is important. You will realise that he helps everyone. Thakur is paying for all wedding expenses for my sister. Seems like Thakur sends you rations. Go and tell that scoundrel.. ..that there is only one man in this village.. ..and his name is Mangal. He will never sell his land! If Thakur hears of this.. ..he will bry you alive in your own land. No mother has given birth to a child who can bury Mangal. Tomorrow when the first sunbeams hit the land.. ..you will know who is capable of buryibg what! Mangal has not put up a sign. Instead it's like a mirror which is teasing us. But i will disfigure Mangal's face so badly.. ..that he will not be able to look into a mirror for life. Look Lulla! You have just returned from the city. You do not know these people. Your enthusiasm might land us in trouble. You will be trouble if you continue to fear them. Hey Lulla! Do not talk about fear before us! We are not even frightened of tigers and lions. Mangal is simply an insect. We can crush him whenever we want to. -Bhairav.. ..when the same insect falls into a dog's ear.. ..it becomes dangerous. I should know better! It makes you a dog! A dog! Crush him! Crush him! It may sound arrogant.. ..but if i don't rob Mangal of his life.. ..i'll not consider myself to be the son a Thakur Mahindra Singh! Shut up! Rob him! Bhairav try to explain it to him. You can rob him only if he possesses something. This is the results of a farmer's toil. Oh Uncle! We will get the true fruits of labour tomorrow. When we sell these grains in the market at a good price. Listen! Bargain the price on the grains properly. Go and sleep. You need to go to the city tomorrow. Ok Uncle. I'll get going. Come on little one! Hey! I do not want to come with you! You tell me sleep outside the house. I'll come with Uncle. - Did you see that Uncle? He is being rotten. -He is just like you! Go on! Go and sleep! It's getting late. You need to go to the city in the morning. We will get good prices this time. There has been a bumper crop. -Yes. I was planning to buy a cycle. -That's good! Mangal what will you buy? I will buy... This is the firt income of my life. I will buy two silver bangles for Radha. Mangal! Hey! Radha! Look if you tease me now... -What will you do? Why don't you understand! Hey Radha! Be careful! Don't fall down! You need to take care of our baby and yourself. Oh you! He troubles me a lot. - What? He troubles you? - Yes. How dare he! Let me talk to him. He is definitely troubling you. Ok i'll teach him a lesson. Should i teach him a lesson? Don't laugh! Close your eyes.Quickly! Don't open your eyes. Mangal go out and sleep. If i don't go? Will you leave or not? - I won't! If you don't leave... You won't listen to me i... I'll teach you a lesson! She beat me! ''She beat me with the board.'' "She trashed me with the rolling pin." "She beat me with the board." "She trashed me with the rolling pin." "She beat me with the tongs." "She trashed me with the utensils." "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "My wife hit me!" "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "My wife hit me!" "She looks innocent but when you touch her she swears." "She abuses! Abuses! Swears! Curses! Abuses!" "I lovely asked my wife for a kiss... ...and the kid's mum got angry at me." "In her rage she threw the pan at me." "The pan blackened my face." "I give up before her anger." "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "My wife hit me!" "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "My wife hit me!" "I was the apple of everyone's eye." "Friends i was better off being a bachelor." "Buddies! Friends! Pals! Friends!" "Listen to me when i advice you not to marry." "Live happily and don't die like this." "I ask her to make my bed and she gets furious." "She beats me up!" "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "My wife hit me!" "My wife hit me! Yes she did!" "Yes she did! My wife hit me!" "How can i tell the villagers?" "I am ashamed to tell them." "How can i tell the villagers?" "I am ashamed to tell them." "How he comes and teases me." "Shameless fool does not understand my helplessness." "Are all men as naive as my husband?" "Are all men like him?" "Forget it darling. Forgive me!" "We will never fight again." "Do you swear on me?" "I swear on you." "Do you swear on me?" "I swear on you." "Do you swear on me? - I swear on you." "Do you swear on me?" "- I swear on you." Brother Mangal! Brother Mangal! There's a fire in the farms! Hurry up! There is a fire in the farms? -Yes brother. Come on! Get some water! Munna! Uncle! Let me go! Leave me! Leave me! Let me go! Leave me! Mangal! -Let me go! Leave me! Let me go! Munna! -No! Munna! -Mangal! Uncle! Listen Krishna! Please save my Mangal! Save him! - Uncle! - Mangal! Father! - Uncle! Krishna! - Mangal! Hey! Munna! Hey! Munna! - Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! No! Munna! ''I do not want to come with you!'' ''You tell me sleep outside the house.'' ''I'll come with Uncle. I do not want to come with you!'' ''You tell me sleep outside the house.'' ''I will come with Uncle!'' ''I do not want to come with you!'' - Munna! Uncle! Mangal dear! What is done is done! Now distribute it among the priests... ...so that the deceased can rest in peace. Get up dear. Look Thakur junior please go away! I do not want any bloodshed today. This is a nice tradition... ...so that deceased can rest in peace. My brother who is alive... ...is suffering because of you all. Scoundrel! Thakur... ...i beg of you! Go away! - Go away! I won't go alone. I will take your corpse with me! Beggars don't have funerals fool! No! Come to your senses! I don't want you to commit murder! - Move aside Bhairav! I'll kill him with my own hands! I'll kill him! He killed my brother! - Come to your senses! I will kill him! No i do not want this villa! It took Lulla's life! - Cool down! He has shattered my dream! I'll destroy him! The rogue crushed my dreams! My Lulla! I won't spare him! I won't spare him! I won't spare him! I won't spare him! Where is Mangal? I asked where is Mangal? I said where is Mangal? Where is Mangal? Tell me! Where is Mangal? - No! So you won't tell us? Hey! Destroy her home! You still have an opportunity tell me where is he? - No! No! Tell me! Where is Mangal Radha? - No! Tell me! Where is Mangal? Say it! Before you lose your life Radha... ... tell me where is Mangal? No! Tell me! I am asking you for the last time. Where is Mangal? Tell me! I will force you to tell me! She will talk! No! No! Banvari never raises him hands on those who are unconscious. What happened? - Thakur's men beat Radha... Radha! No dear! Don't go in at such a time. But Radha... Mangal those scoundrels would have aborted the child.. ..but God saved the child. Pratap Singh! You scoundrel! Come out if you have the guts! Come out! I swear on my unborn child.. ..that I will cut you into as many pieces.. ..as your army of eunuchs have hurled blows.. ..on my beloved Radha. When a man raises his voice.. ..it echoes back. In this big villa your voice will be muffled. Muffled! You won't be able to hear it. I strangle the man who raises his voice. About this darkness.. ..it's not your fault. You life is filled with so much darkness.. ..that you cannot see the light. Raise your sights there is light around! It is not darkness but the anger blazing with me.. ..which will burn you. Just like the way your Lulla died! Like your Lulla died! Just like him! If you speak Lulla's name with your tongue.. ..I will chop it off! Rogue! You spilled Lulla's blood! I will annihilate your family! I will destroy you rogue! Scoundrel! What sign did you put up in your farm? Come on! Tell me! Banvari! If anyone sets foot on this land without my permission... Feet!

Bhairav why are you shivering? Hold it properly! If you don't you won't be able to see. Slowly! Slowly! I was seeing my moustache in the mirror. I was seeing my moustache. Moustache! Yes honestly! No no no ! It will break! Mangal! Mangal! Mangal! Are you alright Mangal? - Yes. What happened Mangal? Take this. You are not hurt are you? -No. No! No! No! Don't cry! What can I do? You are born to poor hungry people. I can't bear to see you starve. It's better that you die! Die! Die! -Hey Radha! Hey Radha! What are you doing? Will you kill him? Silly woman you haven't eaten in four days. How will you lactate? Give him to me! Give him! Food! Food! You have't eaten either! Radha don't care about me. I will be back. I will be back! -Radha!

I'll pay you the money by night. You know that.. ..I'm the most generous person in the entire village Radha. Since you have come to take.. ..you will have to give something in return. Take this! Take this! Take this! Go on! Take whatever you want. Take it! Go on! Take it! You are very generous Lala! You are very generous! Curses! Listen Radha dear! Clean flour in such dirty veil? It doesn't seem right! Throw it! Throw it! No Lala! I am not begging from you. I'm borrowing from you. This is a shop not some charitable institute. Do you think it belongs to your father? Throw it! Throw it! - Lala! Lala i beg of you! I beg you! My kid is starving! - I don't care if he dies! Lala! Mangal hasn't eaten in two days! So you won't listen to me? Fine! - Lala! Lala!

You're upset just because you've lost your interest scoundrels! Think of me! I have lost my principal amount! Yes Lulla was my capital. He meant a lot to me. I loved my brother more than my son. Ever since Radha was pregnant... ...i thought about it. Mangal and Radha should also pine for their son... ...like i am pining for Lulla. Pratap... I'll destroy in such a way that no baby will be born again. Bhairav you are thinking of the future. But what about the son that is causing Thakur anguish? Thakur i told you not to leave that dog alive? If you had killed Mangal that day... There wouldn't have been a child today Lala! If he didn't have a child he wouldn't have realised... ...what it means to lose a child. The foundation of the villa for which Lulla was murdered... ...will be built on Mangal's son's blood. Mangal! Mangal! Mangal! Thakur has kidnapped sister and taken her to the Black Mountains. Don't worry about Raju. Save her. Take care of the baby. Good Lulla! Excellent! Its your reward. - What is this? Go and have sweets. - I don't want money. You said you will get me married. Get me married please! - You want to marry right? Shabbir get him married! You want to marry right?

Dear Radha! - Lala! Dear Radha! Dear Radha! Dear Radha! Dear Radha! You slapped me right? You threw the flour at me! You threw flour at my delicate face and insulted me. But today i will adulterate you. Lala! If i had my way i would mix you in flour... ...make bread and feed them to the dogs! My name is Bhairav! Mangal! When a lion is injured he goes mad. And i have gone mad! Your Mangal has made me crazy... ...for a small piece of land. Do not talk about mother earth. Sinners like you've tainted mother earth. You have injured her too. When a woman is injured she turns dangerous. When a lion is injured he goes mad. But... ...when land is tainted it asks for a sacrifice. Yes Thakur! It demands a sacrifice of sinners like you! I will sacrifice you. Since you are a woman... ...we'll do it dignity. With dignity. I will give you an opportunity. I will count up to ten. If you can save yourself from being sacrificed then try it. Go! One! One! One! One! Two! Two! Two! No! No! No! Three! Three! Three! Four! Four! - No! No! -Four! Stop rogue! Stop! Radha! Radha! Radha!

This is the proof! No! Mangal! These people killed my son! Killed our Raju! Kill these dogs! Chop them into pieces! Mangal! Mangal! Mangal! Mangal! They say lighting a lamp... ...makes the deceased doul rest in peace. Baba... ...Mangal... ...and my son Raju's soul... ...won't be peaceful by lighting this lamp. Till... ...I don't kill thouse three rogues... ...Mangal won't be able to rest in peace. Even my son Raju... ...Raju won't be able to rest in peace. Won't be able to sleep in peace! Don't cry dear! Don't cry! Keep them safe! When these hungry lecherous wolves oppress you... ...they do not let you cry. These tears dry... ...and instead blood drops from the eyes. Yes blood! Bright red blood! Look at me! I was a victim of these scoundrels too. They crippled my body. Look! Look! Look at this staggering body! There is no more blood in this body. It all flowed out. It flowed out as tears! But i... Yes i... A bag of bones... ...who cannot even stand straight did not bend down. I did not bend! I did not break! Come on! Stand up! Come on! Stand up! Come with me! Stand up! I will show you the bitter truth about life! Look at this! Look! Look at these ammunition! I gave the iron some shape to kill those tyrants! I continued to kill them! Go and snatch the lives of those... ...who took away your Mangal! You have Mangal's swear! You have Raju's swear! ''Anklet!'' ''Anklet! I lost my anklet last night at the fair.'' "I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I took a ride in the giant wheel." "I took a ride in the swings." "I got engrossed in the fair and forget it." "I forgot it in the fair." "I forgot it in the fair." "Anklet! I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "Under the artisan's tent... "Under the artisan's tent i halted behind the window." "I was standing there scared!" "It was an intoxicating moment." "I did not see his shadow." "I don't know where the lover came from." "He came and held my hand." "Anklet! I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "First he fed me rasgulla (sweets)." "First he fed me rasgulla (sweets)." "Then he forced me to drink." "It had such an effect on me." "I began to fall here and there." "I began to stagger when i feit dizzy." "When i became conscious i didn't find him around." "Why did i go with him to the fair?" "Anklet! I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I took a ride in the giant wheel. I took a ride in the swings." "I got engrossed in the fair and forget it." "I got engrossed in the fair and forget it." "Anklet! I lost my anklet last night at the fair." "I lost my anklet last night at the fair." No! No!

I'm ready to be married. Shut up! Get lost! Hey! Hey! What's going on? Who are you? Who are you? Why have you opened my shop? How did you open my shop? Why are you distributing this? Did you give birth to a kid? O God! O Lord! Lala! Mother Radha! Mother Radha! My mother! Forgive me! Forgive me! I am bruised! I have taken a beating! I cannot bear any more torture! O Mother Radha! Say Radha darling! Say it! No! You are like a mother to me! You are like a sister to me! You rogue! Words like mother and sister seem meaningless when you... ...speak them. Say Radha darling! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say Radha darling! -No! O Mother Radha! O Mother Radha! -Say it! Lala! You slipped! The floor is very slippery... ...and your feet are delicate. Rascal! You don't value this flour don't you? Scoundrel... ...this flour is the result of a farmer's toil. Sometimes this flour... ...acts like a mother's milk. Scoundrel! It acts like a new life for kids. Do you understand? I won't spare your life you rogue! I will make you realise the importance of this flour. Take the entire stock mother! I don't want it! I am leaving for pilgrimage tomorrow. Don't kill me! -Till today you have done... ...a lot of adulteration! -O mother! But if you don't do any adulteration todat... ...what will you tell God? -O mother! O mother! I will do as you say! I will do as you say! -Lala... ...today i'll mix the food for you. What is this? What is this? Mix it! Eat it! I said eat! Bhairav is dead! You said you will get Radha here in six hours. You haven't even been able to get her shoes. Today she killed Lala. And you are still sitting here quietly. Tell me something is she a storm? -Mr. Thakur listen to me. Call me Mr.Thakur after i'm dead. Call my corpse Mr.Thakur! What do you think? Will that ordinary woman kill me? An ant like her is trying to bite a giant like me! I will swallov her alive! I will swallow her if she tries to bite me! I will kill her! I will murder her alive! I will chop her into pieces and bury her in the same field... Mr.Thakur! Mr.Thakur! Say that it's a lie! If God has killed him... ...I won't bend down before God! Yes! Yes! I won't let his body... ...reach the cemetery. Lord Rama's name... -Is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama's name... -Is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama's name... -Is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama's name... -Is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama's name... -Is the ultimate truth! Tell your officers... ...to drop their guns. Tell them... ...to drop their guns. Return in the vehicle... ...you arrived here. Go back! -Come on! Open the door! Look at this sinner! God has punished him for his sins. But i will make his final arrangements. He is the tyrant... ...who made you all homeless. He tried to build a palace by snatching your land. But now... ...you will get your land. No one can grab it! Thakur Pratap Singh... I wish you were alive... ...to see yourself. Death cannot come near me. It was a trick to catch you. And you were tricked! Now watch as i chop you into tiny pieces... ...and then eat it. With salt. Don't kill Radha! -No! No! -Don't kill her! Thakur! I don't want... ...these poor villagers to shed blood because of our enmity. With these villagers as my witness i announce that... ...i'll kill your kids and you before the sun sets tomorrow. Take this! Take this! Take this! Shoot! Kill! Shoot her! Make yourself happy by killing her. What are you saying Mr.Thakur? These arrangements have been made for your safety. Arrangements! You had made arrangements... ...even when she announced before the entire village... ...that she will kill my child! How dare she kill when we are here? It has happened with you around! It has happened with you around! You turned a living man into a corpse. Wow! What a plan! You'll have a funeral procession. No! No! No! You had the funeral procession of a living person. Just because you wanted a medal star on your uniform? So that they can say that the Inspector arrested Radha! But now that wretch is after my kid! No dear! No! No! I won't let my kid die! I don't have anything other than my kid. I won't let my kid die! I will be bankrupt! I will go broke! I will be destroyed! I will be bankrupt! But... I won't let my kid die! No! No! No! No! Pratap Singh cannot escape! If cannot find him in this lifetime... ...I will be reborn over and over. Yes! I will be reborn over and over. Dear... ...you've been lightening this lamp in the hope that... ...you'll be able to find Pratap Singh with its light. Pratap Singh might be dead after so many years. No! He can't die! I have drawn a line... ...on my palm... ...to murder that rogue! Another star for the police because of Radha! What is this! Isn't it shame on us? Don't know why Radha is killing the police like an enemy? As per your plan... ...we have sent the policeman's body to the police station. And the reward on finding Radha has been increased... ...from hundred thousand to fifteen hundred thousand. My plan is never unsuccessful Shabbir. Now watch... ...as the city cops... ... chase her like dogs. This file contains my resignation. But its dated six months from today. The reason for this resignation is... ...Inspector Shukla's death. Its not only Inspector Shukla's death... ...but also a stain on our reputation. A shame! An insult! It's a shame that we... ...can't catch a woman for twenty years. Vijay! Police can't arrest Radha... ...because the public is supporting her. If she has public support... ...then i have my determination... ...my principles my courage... ...and my loyalty. Sir... ...if i fail to bring in Radha dead or alive... ...in the next six months... ...you can accept my resignation. Mona! Its getting late! You'll have to meet Vijay today! I'll leave if Vijay doesn't come in the next five minutes. I have an important meeting. -You just listen to me. If you leave today under the pretext of a meeting... ...I will not eat talk or see you again! Listen up! I will not be your daughter! But dear it's getting late. -But daddy! He's here! Dad so sweet of you! Hi Vijay! -Hi Mona! Vijay do you know... ...i cancelled dad's meetings so that he could meet you? He's furious! -Mona... I will give you some news... ...which will make you very happy. -So tell me... ...what's the good news? -What's the hurry? First let's meet your dad. -Come on! -Where is he? Dad meet him. He is Vijay. He's the most famous police officer here. Hello! -Hello! Ok daddy you guys can talk... ...while i go and change my clothes quickly. Ok Vijay? - Ok. Vijay. Come dear. You are a famous police officer. You might be encountering some big criminals. Whom did you catch... I mean which department are you in? Sir please sit. I mean... ...where are you parents from? I didn't get a mother's love. Dad has retired. He's on holiday. He's retired. Where do you live? -Four by three Seema Society. Please drop by sometime. -Yes definitely! Look dear my daughter is very stubborn. She has made me wait here... ...so long although i need to go to an urgent meeting. Ok? Nice meeting you. Here she is! Both of you can sit and talk. I need to go now. -Ok. Bye! -Bye! -Dad are you leaving? How did you like Vijay? I liked him so much that i almost choked. Now tell me what's the good news? Whom the entire Indian police force couldn't arrest. -Yes. I've been given the responsibility to arrest someone... Wonderful! -That's why i am going to Nawabpur. What? -I am going to Nawabpur. I couldn't hear you. I beg your pardon! What? I am going to Nawabpur -Speak up! I can't hear you! I am going to Nawabpur! Nawabpur! -I see! Silly girl! Now tell me where are you going? I am going to Nawabpur! -Bye! -Vijay listen! Vijay listen! This was nothing! If you go to Nawabpur i'll eat you alive! Vijay listen! "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "I won't let you go. I'll stop you in your way." "I won't let you go. I'll stop you in your way." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "O heartless don't intimidate me." "Don't try to scare me." "O heartless don't intimidate me." "Don't try to scare me." "It's a love not a song. It's a heart not a police station." "Come and look into my eyes." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Go! Go on you traitor." "I will live without you." "Go! Go on you traitor." "I will not cry." "Where will you escape me?" "You will return here." "There is power in my sighs." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "I won't let you go. I'll stop you in your way." "I won't let you go. I'll stop you in your way." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." "Throw away that stick inspector!" "Take me in your arms." Baba! Baba! Baba! With your blessings... I got Radha's case. Now watch me... I will arrest her before six months. Oh i came to tell you that Vijay listen! We leave for Nawabpur by the morning train. Too much of work and too little time. Be ready to go. Baba! Be packed and ready. I will return in a while. Nawabpur again? Shabbir... ...this story started in Nawabpur. Now it will end in Nawabpur. Inspector if you step on this land again... ...you will be killed. Yours Radha! I didn't understand this. Shabbir. Even corpse can talk. He will talk too. Sister! Sister! Look what happened! Karna! Inspector Vijay! I won't spare your life! You are indeed fortunate Inspector. The bullet merely brazed you. Else it would have been a large wound. Radha attacked me in the night. I won't let her live in peace. Don't get angry Inspector! Don't get angry Inspector! Its spoils your health. Banvari please give him this medicines. He will sleep peacefully all night. -Yes. Ok sir. Good luck! Thank you doctor. Thank you. Look dear! What's done is done! Karma is dead. But... We are still around. Baba... ...you never know... ...what might be the last moment. And when loved ones get separated. God has destined to bring together loved ones. But you... ...tried to kill him. Who are you? He is the cruel... ...ruthless tyrant... ...who took away my child. He chilled my son. He took away my son. Yes i had taken him away. Twenty years ago... ...I brought a cloth drenched in blood. Even today i've brought a cloth. It's drenched in blood too. That belonged to your son... ...and this belongs to your son too. You don't believe me right? Look! Look carefully at this picture! Look Radha! Isn't he just like Mangal? I had become a hardened criminal. But when i went to kill your son... ...my hands trembled. Watching that little angel smile at me... ...melted my heart. I adopted the flower... ...I was sent to trample. That hand helped me win my life back. I beg of you! Spare Vijay's life! 'How can i tell you that Radha is your mother?' Radha! What are you doing here? Look Radha! I can understand the pain of a mother's love. I know that a mother cannot live without seeing her son. But he is he is... I spent my entire life without him. But... ...let me meet him now. No Radha! No! You don't know Radha! He hates you as much as you love him. That's why... My son... Just like... ...just loike your daddy. My dear! My Raju! What condition are you in? O God! We are so unfortunate. Mothers and sons... ...are ready to sacrifice themselves for each other. And we are... ...thitsty for each other's blood. No Radha! No! You don't understand Radha! If he wakes up... ...it will be terrible. Terrible! Did he ever ask about his mother? How is she? Where is she? He asked me a million times. What did you tell him? I told him... ...i told him that your mother is dead. I know that he is your enemy. But don't ever kill him. Never. No not at all! I don't have any enmity with the police. This fool killed one of my men... ...and... ...unknowingly i... I... No Radha! My Vijay cannot kill any innocent man. It's definitely that rascal's trick! That's why he has returned to the village. You... ...are talking about whom? Pratap Singh! Pratap Singh! Look! Death is standing at your door step. Are you hiding? Come! Come out! Who are you? Who are you? Tell me... ...aren't you that girl... ...for whose life your father begged before me. He ran away. Now he'll come to me to take you. Come with me! Vijay! Vijay! Thank God you are alive! I was shocked... ...to hear that Radha attacked you. Did you shoot her? Shot her two ar three times? Yes? Did you fire at her two or three times? I want to see where you were hit. -Uncle! Don't worry. Go home assured. Before you reach home... ...you will get the news of Radha's arrest. That inspector has invited his death by attacking you. Invited his death! -We will not leave him in peace. He has hurt your dignity... I will make that illegitimate... Vijay is my son. If anyone tries to hurt him... ...i will gouge his eyes out! I can tell you the Radha's address... ...whom you are so restless to arrest. Radha's? You know that i can arrest you for lying. The one who is ignorant to the truth... ...cannot arrest for lying. -Behave yourself! You are talking to a police inspector.-Yes inspector! There is not difference between a cop and snake. You sway to the music of illegal traders. But when truth and honest people stand before you... ...you try to raise your fang and try to bite them. Yes Inspector! -Listen old man! Stop ranting! If you know Radha's address... Yes! I've come tell you Radha's address! Her life's story is very short. But you can write a history on each of those pages. They murdered her husband Mangal before her very eyes. They trampled her innocent son Raju beneath their feet. Which mother can bear the loss of of her son? Which wife can witness her husband's murder? That means you know Radha and all the criminals... Yes i know! I know them very well! The killer is none other than Thakur Pratap Singh! Mangal was none other than your father. Radha is none other... ...than your unfortunate mother. -No! Baba! Baba this man's saying... ...that Radha is my mother. Baba... ...is he telling the truth? Tell me. Baba... ...is he telling the truth? Is Radha my mother? Mother! Mother! Call me son mother. I've been waiting for ages to hear you call me son. I never dreamt that... ...my son... ...would call me mother. Can i embrace you and call you mother? The way you are yearning to hear that... ...similarly i am yearning to lay in your lap... ...and tell you... ...how i have been trudging... ...along in this evil age without you. How will this pain heal? How will this pain heal mother? But i don't know... ...if my wish will be fulfilled or not. It will be fulfilled. It's just... It's just a matter of two steps. Only you can bridge that gap. Mother! You can knock down this wall created between us. I am the protector of justice. Therefore i cannot change my path. But you can change your course. I know! I know that my mother hasn't sinned. No crime! Anyone in your place would have done the same. But mother... But it's true that you are still a criminal in the eyes of law. No one can change that fact. I will change that fact... ...but... ...but only after Pratap Singh's death. Why don't you try to understand mother! You can't take law into your own hands. I have lighted that lamp with my husband's blood. I cannot surrender to law till it burns. I will blow off that lamp. -Vijay! Look Mother! No dear! This lamp will not be blown off. I have seen my husband die with my own eyes. That's when i swore that... ...i won't leave them alive. But mother i won't let your oath be fulfilled. Mother! There is no holier relation than that of a mother and son. The entire world worships it. But i am afraid... I am afraid that this relation... ...shouldn't become a stain on my uniform. Well done Vijay! Well done! Its because of your upbringing than you are... ...giving more importance to your duty... ...than your mother. Then think... ...what not i can do to fulfill my duty? The one who gave you birth. Go away before... ...my men forget that... ...you are my son. Go away! Go away! Wait Vijay! Wait! You are meeting me for the first time. I won't turn you away empty handed. Come son-in-law! Welcome! I knew that you can do anything for Mona. I trusted that... ...you will risk your life and arrest that wretch! I am waiting for the day... ...when she'll be hanging unto death... ...and the executor will pull the lever. There will be another star medal on your uniform. Truly! The brightness of that star will be best reflected on my face. I can ruin your face right now Thakur. But i don't want to take the law into my hands. Get ready to hang. I will come back. Wait Vijay! I will go with you. Wait dear. Listen to me. Until yesterday you had this right. Now... ...i feel ashamed to call you my father. Don't call me your daughter Thakur Pratap Singh. 'Hello Inspector Vijay. I'm the D.I.G. Speaking.' 'The commissioner has said... ...that if you are unsuccessful in finding Radha... ...please return.' 'Please leave this and return immediately.' No sir. Sir i... I know where Radha is. I will arrest her and return. Congratulations Thakur. Your life has changed. -What happened? Radha is on her way here to the jaws of death. Shiva! Every person can reach me only by this road. Inspector Vijay wants to kill me... ...and arrest his mother. Radha wants to kill me. Both have to come by this road in order to reach me. Shabbir! -Dima! Again! Now die! Again! Mother! Baba the rope! Catch it mother! Mother! Catch the rope! Catch it! Catch it! Mother! Mother! Catch it! Baba! Catch it! Come on! Thakur! Mother! That day the count down was left off at four. Now i will count from five. And you will run. Five... ...five five five five. Six six six six six. Seven seven seven. Eight eight eight. I will complete the rest of the countdown. Get up! Get up! Nine! Don't move else i'll shoot you! Thakur! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Traducere Manuala Maryo.
