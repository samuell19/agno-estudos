Pardon, monsieur. C'est ma faute. Which of these fine fellas is it? - Right over there, Sire. - Hmm? The one with the inquisitive fingers. Non mais dit donc, espece de brute! Judge him for yourself. Tonight his fancy turns to brunettes, Sire. Last night it was the singer. Before that, another. Believe me, Sire, he is all that you could ask for... A drunken, brawling, cheating villain. Not a shred of decency about him, I can assure you. Perhaps he'll do. We have carefully observed his activities since his arrival a fortnight ago. You are seeing him at his best, Sire. His sins would make the devil blush. I've seen enough. He'll do very nicely. I don't like your manners. Nor I your ugly face. Murderer! He's killed Turec! Get him! If you please, I'm in a hurry! Where to, sir? Paris, and quickly! Hang it, man, you've taken the wrong turn! The main road is washed out. This'll take you where you're going. Where are the carriage tracks? Here they are. Turned off this way. Come on! Whoa. What're you stopping here for? We haven't as yet discussed a fee. The price to Paris is 500 francs. Have you lost your wits? This is no time to talk of money. - Five hundred francs. - I haven't got 500 francs. You'll be paid in Paris. Then stay here and rot! Come on, follow me! Come on, this way. Over here, now! Don't let him get away! He didn't get this far. Must've turned off. Let's search back in the woods. Pray step in. I've been expecting you. There's, uh... There's some mistake. My intrusion here is accidental, I assure you. Don't apologize. You're very welcome. Well, H can explain, if you'll give me a moment. A moment? You're gonna have all the time you want, my friend, and more. Shall we fortify ourselves? You'll find the wine quite good. I must say you don't present a very pretty picture. Nevertheless, I hope you'll accept the hospitality of my house. You'll find that chair very comfortable. I didn't expect to be greeted quite so regally. No? In fact, if it weren't for your door... Oh, yes, that door. Ah... 'Tis a nice little piece of ingenuity, isn't it? I don't know who you are, sir, and I don't care. You don't know me... You are mistaken... Denis de Beaulieu. I know you well... at least by reputation. I said you were expected. You'll permit me to introduce myself. I'm Alain Sire de Maletroit. I am not impressed. Your impertinence is very entertaining. And please don't think of leaving so soon. You'll find me a gracious host if you don't try my patience. Do you mean I'm a prisoner? Pray let us postpone that question, nephew. Nephew? What gibberish is this? I'd as soon a baboon were my uncle. I'm afraid you'll have very little control over that destiny when you marry my niece. Oh, so that's it. You would force me into a marriage with some toothless hag. No, thank you. I'm not the domestic type. But you're much too modest. There were numerous candidates for the honor. I selected you myself. You'll make her anidealhusband. Well, we'll see about that. Though I pity the poor lady if she deserves no better than me. Exactly. I thought you'd be reasonable. In your position, a gambler, a wastrel, a libertine, only two steps ahead of the hangman... - You lie. - Do I? What about that incident in The Red Lion tavern? How did you know about that? Now, let us examine your situation. I offer you protection, all the money you need, a desirable marriage... What have you got to lose? My freedom. Besides, your informants failed to say that nobody tells me what to do. You will find the atmosphere in here healthier for you than it is outside. I'm doing you a favor, believe me. I don't like the smell of your generosity! Your good health... nephew. You look fatigued. Take him to his chamber. What the devil is that? That, my friend, is something that you'll learn less about and hear more often the longer you're here. Sire, you were successful, of course. Of course. How did he take it? The usual reaction of a rabbit in a trap. He fought a little. What else could he do? What would you do under the circumstances, Corbeau, hmm? Occasionally, the trap itself is weaker than the rabbit. We won't let that happen. I can rely on you, Corbeau, can't I? He did not impress me as a bloodless ninny. You may find him difﬁcult. I hope so. It'd quite spoil the game if there were not a struggle in him. - Are the others returned? - They're outside. Bring 'em in. All right, you, here. Don't stand there like clods! Come on in here! Well, Turec, you make a convincing kind of corpse. Don't you agree, gentlemen? Perhaps we might do something about making it permanent. Where's your sense of humor, Turec? After all, Moret did slip your opponent a pistol without a charge. Supposing I had omitted to take that precaution? Life hangs by a slender thread. Congratulations, Sire. You've made your point. I'm sure Turec is convinced of your power. I am, Sire. Thank you, Sire. Now, run along, both of you. Keep out of my sight till my business is settled. I suggest you stay in the old barracks. The panel. Voltan... do you want your ears cropped for eavesdropping? Get up, do you hear? I wasn't listening, I swear it. I just came to report, to tell you that... he is restless tonight. He always is when she's in danger. Nonsense. Do you pay any heed to the ravings of a madman? Get back to your... duﬂes. And if I find you up here again, I'll feed your liver to the swine. I'll quiet him. Voltan knows a way... a very good way. Do you think, Sire, there is anything in what he says? Is it possible that your Br... His name will never be mentioned here. Get out. All of you. I've waited 20 years for this night, Helene. Twenty years. Please, you're hurting me. I don't like intruders in my sleep. - I beg you... - On the other hand, maybe I'm more the fool to question such a stroke of fate. I came here to warn you. I'm afraid you're a little late for that. You should have met me on the terrace. You cannot blame me for finding you more desirable than the others I've met here... can you? Now, to what am I indebted for this mysterious visit? I had to come to you. My uncle... Your uncle? I'm Blanche de Maletroit. You? The devil you say. This truly is my night for surprises. I had pictured you a toothless hag. I assure you, sir, this is no time for levity. You must get away from here. You mustn't be a party to any scheme of my uncle's. What do you know about this? Nothing. Nothing at all. I only know that my uncle is an evil man, that strange things have happened here as far back as I can remember. You know that I'm being forced to marry you? I've been told. He must have some fiendish reason of his own for doing it. Yes, I'm sure. And, of course, you're far above such scheming. What do you take me for, a fool? This visit to me doesn't smack of sweet innocence. I could more easily believe that you, too, are not beyond trickery. You... you... What the devil are you doing here? I brought you fresh attire. And there is food and drink outside. - The sire's orders. - A pox on his orders. No matter to me. But if you want to keep blood in your veins, you'd better change your tune. What do they call you, my friend? Wait outside. Depends on their digestion. Anything from pig to dog through the whole animal kingdom. My true name is Talon. You're unhappy here, Talon? Oh, who is happy these days? I'm sure you're above accepting a bribe, but merely from a sense of justice, will you help me to get out of here? I know nothing aboutjustice. Bribery is different. What have you to offer? Nothing. Not a thing. In that case, I'll remain faithful to my master. Uh, suppose I were to promise you some future reward? Oh, a future reward. On such a promise, I'll show you the way out. Come. Your kindness ovenlvhelms me. I can see why they call you such endearing names. I suppose you'd have me fly down to that mill wheel and let it spin me away from here. That is no ordinary mill wheel. You've perhaps heard of Cabrissade? The torturer. In the Middle Ages he used this chateau for some of his favorite experiments. This mutton's good! How is our guest? Well enough, Sire. He slept like a babe. Speak up, swine. How did he act, hmm? I want to show him every consideration. He, um, offered me a bribe this morning. A sterling character, Sire. Now he has added bribery to his other virtues. Good choice, Corbeau, hmm? Excellent. Well, I feel better than I have for years! My appetite has an edge. Mmm! What are you gaping at? Does the sight of food distract you? It's not the sight of food that distracts me, Sire. It's the lack of it. Oh, um, Talon... did you, um, accept the bribe? It wasn't juicy enough, Sire. Not near as juicy as that chop. Well, here, dog. He's earned a bone for his fidelity. But he'd have betrayed me if he could. I-I can't trust anyone. I'm surrounded by rogues. Birds of a feather, Sire. Tell me, could you tolerate an honest man in this house, hmm? That's right, Corbeau. In my secluded dominion, villainy binds men together. But I'm an understanding master. My servants appreciate me. Oh... Turn around, my dear. Let me look at you. You'll make a beautiful bride. Uncle, why are you doing this to me? My dear, to give you happiness. You're 20, well past the age when maidenhood is fashionable. But such a marriage must fail. It will not fail. But it is Armand I love. How can you possibly... I do not wish to discuss it. Ah, de Beaulieu, did you sleep well? I see that you have resigned yourself to my hospitality. This is my niece Blanche de Maletroit. Blanche, this is Denis de Beaulieu. Oh, so I meet my prize. Well, I must say she exceeds my expectations. Nevertheless, I choose my own women. I prefer it that way. You, uh... you have no choice in the matter. I'd rather be dead than be forced on this man. My dear, my dear, don't say you ﬁnd him... unattractive. Looking on you both, I should say that you are divinely suited to each other. Your sight is as foul as your plans. Uncle, please don't force me into this marriage, even though you disapprove of Armand. On the contrary, my dear, I heartily approve of your young captain, but he has proved himself undeserving by his cruel neglect of you. He would not willingly neglect me. I promise you that Monsieur de Beaulieu will prove even more devoted in his attentions. Isn't that right, Denis? To admit you are right about anything is to impugn the meaning of the word. Oh, Uncle, I don't wish to displease you. I'm grateful for all the care you've given me since the death of my parents. No gratitude, no gratitude. Nevertheless, I'm grateful. Only consider my feelings. Admit my right to happiness, to the man of my choice. Armand is a good man. He's of honorable family. He's kind and thoughtful... and he loves me. It's very tiresome of you, Blanche, to go on in this way. I've told you that Armand is neglectful and unworthy. Very well. If that be so, I'll make you a promise. On the soul of my mother... Your mother? I promise I'll never see him again. I-I'll give him up. Only... please don't make me go through with this unholy marriage. You see, de Maletroit, no mortal man could endure such a paragon of virtue. This lady is too pure, too noble for a man of my tastes. There, Uncle. By his own words, this gentleman reveals himself. Few of us are... perfect. Please, give me a little time. Most assuredly. I wouldn't have you rush headlong into this. It takes time to kindle the fires of love. You shall have 24 hours. Now, make the most of it. Learn to love your husband. For appearance's sake, I would like you to go to the altar with a smile of happiness on your face. How could I be happy with a man I've just met? Just met? Have you forgotten your visit to him last night? And that, alone, is reason enough for you to marry him. They've begun by disliking each other. Hatred will come later. I'm in the mood for relaxation. Let's visit the dungeons. That's always diverting, hmm? It would be amusing if we could let him know what's going to happen. But he won't understand. Mmm... what a pity his mind is so clouded. Lessens the pleasure. Come along. Forgive me, I'd rather not. It depresses me. When I think of what he was and what he's become now, I... You're squeamish, Corbeau, much too squeamish. So, there is another man? Yes. And, of course, he is all the things you said of him? Then there is all the less reason why your uncle should prefer me. Perhaps he thinks you're better for me. Oh, of course. I'm an angelic figure, complete with wings and halo. You appear more the small boy who would fancy himself the devil. Now, let's forget about me and talk about you. Does your uncle mistreat you? Does he deny you all the things you want? No. No, I can't say that he does. It's just that, as far back as I can remember, something strange has always happened. Whenever I've held anything really dear to me, it's been snatched away, destroyed. There was once a maid. She was my companion. Then again, a little spaniel. Your uncle did these things? I have no proof. They just happened. This young captain... Do you love him? Armand? You heard my uncle. I haven't seen him for months. He visited with me one day last spring. That was the last I ever saw of him. No word since. That's very strange. Strange? Yes, it is. You, uh, think something has happened? I'm sure he would've gotten word to me somehow if he were able. That's why you must get away from here. I appreciate your concern, but I've already discovered that one does not just walk out of here at will. I know that, too, but I'll find a way. Come, come, come, Edmond. Surely, you don't fear me after all these years. You must know that I wouldn't do you bodily harm. That would be too easy, too quick an end. I have more delicacy than that. A father's fondest dream is about to come true. And what a wonderful husband he'll make, Edmond. A blackguard without scruple or conscience, to destroy her. Yes, my dear brother, she shall know the agony of betrayal as I've known it. She shall suffer as I've suffered. And that's my gift to your child... my wedding gift. A husband for her, a son-in-law for you. That's right, scream. If only you could understand what I'm talking about. To hear you beg for mercy... That would be my supreme pleasure. Where have you been? Haven't I told you never to leave him? Water, Sire. I came to bring him water. Ah? I am desolated, Edmond, that I can't invite you to the wedding supper, but I fear that a man who's been dead for 20 years might cast a gloom upon the company. See what I brought you, Master? From the sire's own dinner table. Tell me, Voltan, is what my brother says true? Is there such a man here? Is my daughter being forced to marry him? It is true, Master. If only I could get out of this. If only I could get out. It is the one key I do not have. The only one. The sire always keeps it with him. You've been my faithful friend, Voltan. Without you, I could never have endured these years. It was my wish to serve you, Master. Now there's one more thing I ask of you, and you must find the courage. Courage? I'm too afraid of him. This man must never marry her. You understand? I understand. Tonight. It must be done tonight. It will be done. Voltan, what are you doing here? I came to wake him. He's in danger. Who is this nightmare? You mustn't say that. He's my friend Voltan. He'll help you. Won't you, Voltan? Help him? Now, listen carefully to what I tell you. If he remains here, something evil will happen. You understand that? Yes, I understand. It must not happen. You must get him away from here. You can do it, can't you? You know a way out. Yes, Mistress. Voltan knows a way. Then let us go at once. Well, Voltan? It is better, Mistress, if you do not go. The way runs through the old barracks. I'm not afraid. He's right, Blanche. I wouldn't have you in danger because of me. I'm not worthy of it. Somehow I wish our meeting had been under different circumstances. I can't help thinking... Oh, please, Denis, say no more. You must go quickly. Good-bye. Please be careful. Ready, Voltan. This way. Down there. Why do you wait? You go, I'll follow. The statue is heavy. It must be held. Lead the way. Very interesting. Too bad I can't spend more time here. This was the man I thought I had killed at the tavern. But if you killed him, how can this be? That's just the point, Voltan. How can it be? There was only the sire's word for it. Just as I thought... Not a trace of a bullet wound. Voltan, there was a sinister purpose in making me seem a scoundrel. I fear it means nothing but harm for your mistress. Harm for her? One thing is certain... She needs help. You would help her? Come, take me back to her. Here. See that they are delivered promptly. Do not spare your horse. You will take these. They go as far as the township of Rouen. Well? Shall I await the answer, sir? When the Sire de Maletroit extends an invitation, the answer is always yes. Now, you've all had your instructions. Are there any questions? Two beeves have been slaughtered. Will that be sufficient? Yes, with the suckling pig and the muttons. Cook, what of the game? Peafowl, quail, grouse, partridge, and baby larks. Good. I would suggest also a pie of venison ﬂavored with truffles and spices, and the eels, of course, and the snails. Lots of snails. But that's all. We don't want our guests to overeat, hmm? All right, be off with you. Oh, steward, I'll come to the cellars later. I want to taste the wines. Is that the list of vintages? Yes, sir. We have Chanson Pére & Fils Meursault, Chablis Supérieur, Charmes-Chambertin... Sir, I must have a word with you. Speak, man. Speak quickly. Oh, the service, Your Reverence, will be dignified but brief. I don't believe in excessive sentiments on these occasions. As you will, Sire. Corbeau has made all fitting arrangements for the music. The ceremony will start promptly at eight of the clock. Have him brought here immediately. Oh, a trifling detail. Monsieur de Beaulieu is not a native of these parts, so you'll refrain discreetly from mentioning his family. That's all. Turec and Moret have just been found. I was unaware that they were lost. You did not permit me to finish. Turec and Moret have just been found dead. Murdered. Murdered? What are you talking about? How is that possible? It's true. They were killed sometime during the night. Do you think our bridegroom might have a hand in this? I know no more. Good day, Uncle. Ah, my dear niece, it does my heart good to see you so merry. And have I not reason for cheer? The happy bride. Perhaps my lady has some other reason for her good humor. What other reason could there be? Corbeau is a cynic. Pay no heed to him. Nothing is too good for you. It will be a festive occasion. I hope you won't be disappointed, Uncle. Disappointed? Why should I be? Oh, for many reasons. Perhaps some important personage may not appear. Even the bridegroom may be absent. I've heard of such things happening. Not in this case, my dear. You're right, as always, my dear uncle. I trust you spent a peaceful night. Never better, Sire. Two of my men were slain last night. - Oh, and will they rise again? - What do you mean by that? Your men are so hardy. Like cats, they have nine lives. Nevertheless, they are dead. Well, we mustn't talk about death at a time like this. It's not fair to my bride. We're on the threshold of a new life... marriage, happiness. Everything lies in front of us except death. Come, bride-to-be. Although our future is too well-ordained for discussion, our past is still worth talking about. There is a formality that requires your attention. The signing of the articles of marriage. There's another formality... The publishing of the banns. You haven't allowed the prescribed time. Do you think I would overlook such a thing? Examine the date on this document, nephew... That is the night on which you honored me by walking through my door. It is also the date of the publishing of the banns. If you please. Thank you. Now I think Monsieur de Beaulieu would enjoy the privacy of his chamber for a while. Besides, my dear, it is most unlucky for the bride and groom to see too much of each other on their wedding day. Count Grassin! Ah, my dear Count Grassin. A trifle late but always welcome. It's a long journey, my friend. And, alas, punctuality was never one of my virtues. It suffices that you are here. I assure you nothing could've kept me away. I want you to meet my nephew-elect Denis de Beaulieu. Denis, this is Count Grassin. - Good evening, sir. - De Beaulieu? Hmm. I once knew some de Beaulieus in Normandy. - The name is not unique in France. - Mm-hmm. The ones I refer to were rather an impetuous lot. The son, particularly. Had a faculty for getting into trouble. One scrape after another. Finally, his father disinherited him. You're not related, by any chance? To rabble of that sort? If so, would I admit it? Forgive me. I meant no offense in linking you with the Normandy de Beaulieus. I see my error. You, also, my friend, must forgive an old man whose tongue age has robbed of diplomacy. Your servant. Then, come, sir. Would you join me in a cup to show there's no ill feeling? We'll pledge the good health of our host. Any excuse for a drink. Thank heaven you are here, Grassin. What is this comedy you're playing? I'm a prisoner here. I need your help desperately. What can I do? You must arrange for an escape tonight. And believe me, sir, I soon put him in his place. Imagine trying to sell me black britches when I specifically ordered purple, eh? It will not be easy. De Maletroit is a clever man. Fortunately, I know this house well. There is a door in the south wing leading to the burial ground. Can you find it? I'll find it. Good. At two of the clock, my coach will be waiting there. What of the guards? Every exit is covered. I repeat, it will not be easy. Good luck. In springtime, in spring... time In pretty, pretty springtime With a hey and a ho and a hey-nonny-no... The perfect bridegroom. The more fool, he. In springtime, in springtime... Get to your feet. I need a drink. It was a good party. I must come again. You drunken sot. Arouse yourself. It's time you joined your bride. My... my bride. My pretty little bride. Where is she? She's upstairs. She's gone. Oh, that's too bad. See him to her chambers. My little bride, my little bride... Shh! I want to surprise her. See? My little bride awaits me. Now, go away. I wanna be alone. Oh, no, wait a minute, I... I'm sorry, friends. I'll take care of you next time. Good night. I'm sorry, Blanche. I didn't mean to frighten you. - Then you're not... - Luck was with me tonight. I met an old friend at the reception... Count Grassin. You knew Count Grassin? A long time ago. He was a friend of my father's. He will help us get away from here. I will take you to his estate in Normandy. You'll be safe there. Then you can have this mockery of a marriage annulled. Oh. That's what you want, isn't it? Oh, yes, I suppose so. Isn't it? You must tell me something truthfully. This young captain, Armand, do you love him very much? I don't know. Last night when you left, I thought a weight would be lifted from my heart. It wasn't so. I was glad you were safely away, but I was sorry you'd gone. And when you saw that I had returned? I knew how much you meant to me. Oh, darling. My life was meaningless until I met you... Wasted in an aimless search for pleasure. I love you. Come, we must hurry. Oh, you'll need a cloak. There's a door in the south wing. Count Grassin will be waiting. This way. Help me. Here? The old armor is kept here. Yes, I know. Some of it fell on me last night. Careful. Must we go through here? It's the only way. Then we must chance it. What was that? Who's there? - Count Grassin? - In there, sir. He's had a bit too much to drink. Traitor! And you call yourself a friend. You'll have to speak louder, Denis. Much louder. Run for the gate, Blanche! It's high time you arrived. What delayed you? I saw someone near the gate and gave chase. Where's the girl? Have no fear. She won't get far. So, the honeymooners return. Reluctantly, I gather. You ran away... why? Wh-why do you want to desert me so soon? Are you dissatisfied with your surroundings? Why, you never even said good-bye to me. You hate us so. I should think you'd be glad to get rid of us. You mean that you went out of consideration for my feelings? How very thoughtful of you. There was no need to kill Grassin. You could've saved yourself an unprovoked murder. Unprovoked? Well, I won't dispute that point, but it did upset me. I'm-I'm averse to bloodshed. Besides, knives are untidy. Why didn't you stop us sooner? My little pleasantry, that's all. It amused me to let you think you could get away together. I hope you've both observed that I have a sense of humor. Uncle, what more do you want of us? You wished us to marry... We've done so. Now we ask only to be free to go our own way together. - Together? - We ask no more. Together? You're telling me that you no longer dislike each other? Oh, that would be a pity. You haven't been rash enough to fall in love? Oh... There's your answer. There's nothing you can do about it. How wrong you are. There are many things I can do, but I'm afraid you'd find them rather disagreeable. Uncle, what's back of your hatred? What have I ever done to you? You? It's not you, Blanche. You have her to thank for your fate... your mother. My mother? I loved her once. She led me to believe that she loved me. You loved my mother? Does that surprise you? Look at her beauty. She should've been mine, but she betrayed me. She married your father, a spineless dreamer. My mother died when I was born. Hasn't her debt been paid? Ah, she paid for her faithlessness, but your father... He's dead, too. Dead? You shall be the judge of that. Blanche, it's clear to me now. Why I was chosen to be your husband. He thought I was a scoundrel. He thought I'd destroy you. That's why Armand was so unwelcome here. Quite so. What have you done to Armand? Hmm? Oh, he was too saintly for this wicked world. I sent him to paradise. - No. - Oh, here. His ring. You're really quite clever, Denis. I can promise you an interesting evening. You will find that I have a practical as well as a romantic side. But, first of all, I must introduce you to another guest of mine. Come along. The wheel turns swiftly tonight. Perhaps too swiftly. Good wine should be sipped and savored slowly. I've waited long enough. My cup is full. I must slake my thirst. Each to his own taste. Now, we shall have a little family reunion. No, Corbeau. I share this wine with no one. Who is he? Time does not permit a formal introduction. You said a family reunion. I did. Allow me to present your father... Edmond de Maletroit. Oh... You must forgive his indifference. Twenty years of residence here have dulled the edge of his perception. My father. Make the most of this occasion. It will be brief. You have at most 15 minutes. The walls. They're moving! The ingenuity of the de Maletroits. Don't think badly of me. Family affection was never my strong point. - You maniac! - Aah! You should not have opposed me. I offered you much. Do what you want with me, but let Blanche go free. No, Denis, no. Is that a fair request? You mustn't ask for the impossible. Forgive me, I'm pressed for time. I bid each of you a fond farewell. He's a madman. Yes. He's been mad for 20 years. No, not I. I'm quite sane. But he would've killed me long ago had he known it. It was the only thing that saved me, robbed him of the pleasure of killing me. But all these years? If I had only known. I didn't want you to, my dear. You could've done nothing. Everyone was under his thumb. Only Voltan remained faithful. I swore him to secrecy... to guard you from harm. I've failed. It will not be long. I wonder if you really hate her so much. What do you mean? Love and hatred are often confused. They are not dissimilar, and she is like her mother. You go too far, Corbeau! We're alone now; We can speak truthfully. My life has always been empty. I was born without purpose and I'll die that way. But I envied you because you knew the passion of both love and hate, and that is what made you my superior. Am I not so still? I'm only telling you this lest you regret what you're doing. Regret? You think that I'm a weakling? I know no pangs of conscience. My way is clear! I was wrong. You'll carry your hatred to the grave. I'm still your servant. I wonder if you really hate her so much. And she is like her mother. You'll carry your hatred to the grave. I wonder if you really hate her so much. She is like her mother... like her mother... like her mother. I wonder if you really hate her so much. The walls... They've stopped moving. Voltan! Master, the key. The key! The key to the cell. Voltan. Voltan, you must help us. Voltan! Voltan, the key. Only you can help us now. The key... we must have the key. My dear, you're the image of your mother. Isn't she lovely, Denis? She is, indeed, sir. My boy, this door brought you into our lives. It stands open now. You're free to leave as you came, or stay, if you wish. I'm a willing prisoner. If Blanche will have me, Sire, you may seal this door again forever.
