Good morning, Lauren. Spider's Web I'm just wandering way you don't call. Spike in Nakigomi. - It's ours. Harry put in a major buy last night. Gabe, he's betting on the damn wrong horse. Shimi's buying Plytek, or I eat my shoe. You may be right. But the only ones who know are Shimi, Plytek and the Nakigomi folks. Harry's had the Midas touch too long for me to argue with and keep my job. Rein that indignation in before you lose yours. If you want my advice, take your own advice. There's plenty of Plytek to be had. Buy yourself some. Okay, I don't know. Just keep me briefed on things, all right? Tilt that camera down and we have a deal. It's not fail I only get to see your face. Sayonara, Gabe. Who are you talking to? - My man in Tokyo. Too far to do much for you here. You'd be surprised. I love looking at you. So I see. Well, aren't you the cat's meow. Just shut up. Hey, what the hell's wrong with you? - Plenty. But you're not the man to make me well. It's morning, we're done. I have a meeting I'll be late for so it's time for you to go. Make it official, put some money on the dresser. How much do you think you're worth? All right. Who knows where the ball is? Wherever the ball is, that's where the money at. Yeah, you know. What about you? Now that, kiddo, is a losing game. Yeah, yeah, here we go. You got something for me? Wanna tell me why I'm chasing suits to every expensive restaurant in town? To restaurants? He's eating out? A more expensive place each night. This joint, a week's wages for a side of fries. So what? So everything. This suit of ours runs Plytek Electronics. In talks with Sony, looking for a buyout... Negotiations that my boss says are doomed. Tell me something, Manny... ...does this look like somebody who's failed to you? You have any extra cash, put it in Plytek soon... ...because this stock is gonna move. Okay, I'm late. - So go. Thanks. Manny... ... I really appreciate it. You know that, don't you? Hey, kiddo... ...you gave me a break. The boy will never understand the word " respect." We'll give him a few more minutes. - What are we waiting for anyway? Him. Sorry I'm late. - Late was 15 minutes ago, Clay. Sorry, Dad. Traffic's murder, I made a wrong turn. He's late on purpose. He's always been a sanctimonious little prick. All right, let's get down to basics. Persu... on Law of the land Harding Glass and Mr. Harding's personal holdings... ...will be held in a blind trust by De Winter & Hathaway. Harry, you have a few things to say on that, I'm sure. Turn to page six in your financial statement. ...approaching the 800 million mark, proven return for the fiscal year... ...is a full 3.1 % in excess of the 10.3 % projected last quarter. Ms. Bishop. - Yes, sir. But first, don't you think we should discuss the G.N. question? Excuse me? Is this some kind of joke? You've promised to divest of your stock options, have you not? Divest? You mean, give up? And after five years on the board? I think what Ms. Bishop means... We believe there is a way for you to give up your position... ...while keeping it at the same time. A way the administration will give its blessing to. And how is that? Give it to charity. Or, more specifically, a charitable trust that you yourself endow. All the same in the end. It's only an option, of course. An option that anyone... ...wishing to run for public office in the future might find beneficial. I have taken a temporary post by the invitation of the president... ... Ms. Whatever-Your-Name-is. But what makes you think I would ever run for office? If I were a betting woman... ...I'd say you want to be governor. Of course, "Senator Harding" has a good ring to it too. Why not president? Thank you very much, Ms. Bishop. That was very ably put. Good work, Harry. I don't mind telling you, I was worried when Leland promoted... ...so young a man, but I was wrong. You run one hell of a team. - Thank you, sir. Good morning, De Winter & Hathaway. Hold on. It was nice meeting you. Harry. Good morning, De Winter & Hathaway. One moment, please. My office. Now. De Winter & Hathaway, can you hold please? Good afternoon, De Winter & Hathaway. You're fired. I want you out from building by 5. Give your keys and your passwords to the office manager. You can't be serious. He liked it. Not even Doug, who has 10 years seniority on me, and hates my guts... or any of the other managers for that metter, would not have allowed himselves to do, what you just did. I approve of what we do and do not pitch. I expect loyalty in conference with clients. Especially from a damn tech analyst. - Chief technology analyst. Right, right, right. You've had your skirt in a twist ever since you set foot in this place, haven't you? Excuse me? First female analyst at De Winter & Hathaway. First women on a fucking moon. Well, congratulations, honey. Now you're the first one to get fired. Get out. Here's to being first. Not interested. You haven't heard the offer yet. Look, it hasn't been a banner day. So... First off, allow me to get you another drink. Belvedere martini, straight up. Young ladies should never have to pay their own way. Young ladies? I think I have a couple of years on you. Yeah? It so happens that I have prized experience. Very smooth. Actually, yes. Bob Smooth. Well, Mr. Smooth... ...l'll be right back. I should have eaten something. - Don't you worry. I'll get you home nice and safe and sound. This it? That's your car? - Yeah. Okay. There you go. Your chariot awaits. And this is your ride. It's a little more rough than smooth. Oh, yeah! But you like that, don't you, honey? Come on. Come on, lean. Wait. - This is gonna be great. She wanted it. - Get out of here, now! Put that down. You know where you are? I know where I am. You know I brought you here? I know what you did. Who was that guy? Bob. - Bob who? I don't know. There's a Coke in the fridge. Will you get it for me, please? He must have slipped you something. You weren't just drunk. I don't get drunk. What were you doing there? First you're on the Continent and now you're everywhere I go. You know, the customary thing to say at a time like this... ...is "thank you." Wait. Where are you going now? - Anywhere you're not. Wait. Please? I'll do it. Thank you. A snap decision? To save me? My only choice. You didn't have to stay. - I wanted to be sure you were all right. And what now? What's the customary thing to do? There's nothing customary about our meeting, Lauren. I'm open to suggestions. So am I. I thought you didn't like... ... De Winter & Hathaway types. I don't. And you don't work there anymore. News travels fast. How did you know? I called your office. I heard that Harry let you go. It wasn't hard to figure out why. You called my office? Why? You could read French upside down. What about your girlfriend at the bar? What language could she read for you? Emily. She's just a friend. Old college buddy. It was just a reunion drink. How chivalrous. A drink with one... ...a roll with another. Don't move. Hey. Glad you're up. Holy Jesus! What is it, Gabe? Nothlng big. Shimi just announced they're buylng Plytek for 3 bllllon dollars cash. Aren't you glad you bought some for yourself? I better go before someone sees a naked lady on my screen. I'll see you soon. Good news? That depends. On what? On whether you'd still like me if I was a De Winter & Hathaway type again. She brought these to your attention... ...and you disregarded them? I thought they were inconclusive, sir. - Inconclusive. What was our position on Nakigomi Electronics yesterday? 15.7 million spread out over seven trusts. And today? - 5.3 million. Plytek? - Stock is up 123 %. Is that a conclusive amount? Look. It was my call, Leland, I take responsibility for that. Glad to see you're taking credit. Glad to see you just don't take credit for other people's ideas. The Harding charity was Ms. Bishop's idea also, wasn't it? Yes, it was. And, for that, she was fired. I made a mistake. Okay? I know that, Leland, I do. Take me one quarter to catch up, and I will catch up. You won't have to do that. I wouldn't want to put you under such undue pressure. You see, it was my mistake. I gave you my trust. Talk to Jeffers about severance. Leland, please. - That's all. All right. Now... ... Ms. Bishop. I've just made Doug Caulfield head of our Trust Department... ...and I was wondering if you'd consider coming back to work for him. Twenty percent raise? I'd be delighted, sir. Thank you. Wow. You're amazing. So tell me about Daddy. Daddy. Well, I wouldn't say he hates me. I think he envies me, because I never wanted to be him. That's an interesting distinction. - Yeah. Now he's going to make me pay for it by trying to force me into compliance. So I guess that'll show you how much I know about business. And you, the heir to a glass fortune. Well, plate glass and ketchup bottles. Thanks. That's what everybody thinks. But, you know, my family... ...created some beautiful hand-blown glass back in the '30s. We have a lovely collection back at the house. Really? I'm impressed. I'd be glad to show it to you sometime. Well, there's no time like the present. Okay. This is nice. Plate glass and ketchup bottles. Mr. Harding. I'm afraid your father isn't back yet from the gym, sir. No problem, Ms. Wilkins. I'm just giving my associate here the grand tour. Very good, sir. - Thank you. Very good, sir. Would you like the rest of the tour? - I'd love it. Jesus. These are the finer pieces from the collection of the 1930s. You like that one? It's beautiful. You have a good eye. That one's my favorite. You know what I like most about this collection? They had nothing to do with what created the family's wealth. These are... For living. Exactly. Would you like to see the rest of the kingdom? No. I'd rather play with the prince, now that I have him alone. Don't you think that's a bit of a risk? The king might be coming back soon. Well, then we'd better hurry. Ms. Wilkins! Good afternoon, sir. Good workout? - Always. Could you have the car in front in 15 minutes? I'll make whatever calls on the ride to the senator's. Very good, sir. Very good, sir. He works out every day. He's as healthy as a horse. This is funny. I feel like a little kid that's hiding from Daddy. Yeah, but there's a difference. You're not a little kid anymore. What time will you be coming home after your meeting with the senator? I have things to finish at the office before I leave for Washington. Very good, sir. So you like taking risks? I like sharing risks. What now? We see what sort of dividends the venture pays. We check our quarterly reports and see if it's a short-term or long-term play. You easy little whore. So goddamn predictable. Lauren, come on in. I was going over your proposals. - Anything you like? We'll put it to committee at the next planning meeting. I especially like this Bio-Mark prospectus. Could be a winner. I'd bet the house on it. We play our cards right, we could own this company outright. Not just a social visit I see. - Come on, Doug. Paul Kittridge is retiring soon, his accounts need a manager. You said you'd... - Close the door. Well? I put it to De Winter, and he shot me down. Just like that? - He promised the accounts to Garber. Why? - He didn't tell me. Well, then guess. He'd never admit it, Lauren, but you heard the man. He talks about the Continent, for chrissake. He lives like a Victorian. The client roster's a bunch of old men. You saw Harding at the meeting. Everybody in the room knew the charity idea was yours... ...but who did he congratulate? De Winter knows that. He won't take a chance of losing the confidence of the families that keep trusts here for century more. Wait. Just wait a minute. It's because I'm a woman. - Lorene. Three years, Doug, I've been here three years. Don't get discouraged. Give me time. I just can't organise that. De Winter's watching me like a hawk. I gotta do good before he listens to me. But I think I can get you another raise soon. Harry said to give him time, and now you too? I do my best. - So do I. My best only seems to help the men around here. Lauren, hang on. Stop thinking about it. What should I think about? You want me to give you a hint? What's that look? Admiration. It's not easy to slug it out with the big boys. Best look of admiration I've ever seen. Maybe because it's more than that. Don't. Don't talk like that just yet, okay? Why? Quarterly report not good enough? What are you doing? Packing. Let's go back to town. Clay... ...my life didn't just start when I met you, you know. I've been married. Okay, so you've been married. I worked three jobs to put him through school. My life for his. I didn't think about it twice. And then he just up and left you. Just left? No. He did an outstanding job of leaving. - And I'm not him. And how long before you tire of me, Clay? A year, five years? What's gonna happen...? - Stop it! For you. Clay. I stole it. Took a risk. You know why? Because when I look at that, I see beauty. But when my dad looks at it, he sees an asset. So that makes it mine... ...probably more than his. He called me last night from Washington. Said he's got a job for me. One of the plants in Tennessee needs a manager. It got me thinking... ...good things. About you and me here. It feels good. So I thought, "Tell him no." All that money's going to be mine someday. If I could have it now, I'd share it with you. We'll be okay. We'll survive. It's funny. You'll go to work for men who will never respect you. And I'll go to work for a company I couldn't care less about. Nous ne cone l'avons jamais la vie. We never would have lived. You sure you don't want any coffee while we wait? No, thanks. If I have any more, I think I'll bounce in place. We wouldn't fly you all the way out here for nothing, Fran. Remember that. Sorry to have kept you waiting. - Mr. De Winter. Sir, this is Jim Herman, CEO of Bio-Mark. This is Mr. Phil Kelmenson, chief scientist. And Ms. Fran Crawford, chief financial officer. How do you do? Did you have a nice flight? That depends on how it ends, sir. We're still up in the air. This may be an inappropriate metaphor, but prepare yourself for landing. Gentlemen, by this time next month... ... Bio-Mark Inc. Should be fully funded for phase one of the human trials. So suppose we talk particulars. You were right. That money's yours. The only thing that separates you from your wealth is time. Your father dies, it's all yours, correct? Look, Lauren, I know what I said. We were just talking, okay? Next you'll say we should have him killed, huh? Don't be ridiculous. This isn't a ridiculous conversation? - No, it's doable. And I can do it. I want to be with you, Clay. Listen, let's forget the money. If you mean what you say, let's just get out of here. You have enough money. I know a place in Prague we can rent for nothing. And then what? What happens when that runs out, huh? The one thing I'm not gonna do is go back to nothing. Lauren... - I've been there, and you haven't. This is the way the world works. You take what you can. The timing couldn't be more perfect either. The money's in a blind trust. Your dad won't even know, not for a while. How would something like this work? Like that. We play a little shell game. Sorry, you lose. How you doing? Who's cheating on who? I don't even know any more. All right, so what is it that's so important it couldn't wait? What do you mean "disappear"? You know exactly what I mean. Are you in trouble or something? - No. But I plan to be. Shit, kid. Change that plan. I can't. I won't. There's plenty in it for you if you help. I promised your father I'd look out for you. Then do it. You know the kind of people I need to pull this off, don't you? I know every kind of people. I thought I knew you. - You do know me. And you also know that I won't play a losing game. All right. Let's hear it. But tell me everything, and I mean everything. There's a large block of cash... ... 40 million or so, in your father's account, waiting for a major play. Okay. Doug's been searching for a availible start-up company for just such an investment. Bio-Mark is that company. Okay. We wait until the investment is approved, and it will be within weeks... ...then we make sure the money isn't transferred into Bio-Mark's account... ...but into one that we've set up. How do we do that? It's the shell game. The con is... ...we distract the mark long enough to simply roll the ball off the table... ...so that, no matter where you look, there's nothing there. First, we steal Doug's passwords. We'll need that surveillance camera of yours. And then all we do is set up a duplicate account. You know, it's ... not some secretary's paycheck you're depositing, kiddo. Doesn't this Doug guy double-check his paperwork... ...before sending $40 million to some fake bank account? Or, one that's similar. Come on now, Lauren. - I make up that paperwork. I'm the liaison between Doug and the bank. With his passwords, we change the file in the computer to match... ...he checks one against the other... By then, we're gone. First thing's first. We're going to need a forger. Really good one. Manny? I got somebody. How many? One for him. Two for me. What, we're an only child? Mike, what's the fucking price? - Depends on the quality. So Herbert Hoover couldn't tell. It's 40 a pop. It gets you your passport... ...driver's, social, medical records... ...everything. - A hundred grand for all three... ...or we go to what's-his-name. Dicky Sacks. Dicky Sacks? Dicky Sacks can suck my dick. Want a fake I.D. to get into a bar? Go to Dicky Sacks. You want identities, you pay the price. It's three human beings I have to create. Two. One is already there, I just need to duplicate her. Francine Crawford. Chief financial officer, Bio-Mark Inc. You're in for a score, lady. No discounts. Nice tat. Thanks. Wouldn't expect it from a sweet college boy like you. It was a good way to piss off Daddy. Fine. $120.000. Great. Let's mix up some DNA. Hey. Try these. Smile. Voila. Voila. Not bad. Wow. You weren't kidding about this view. Nice. Very nice indeed. I'll take it. There It Is. - Okay. And here we go. What do you got? Here are the Bio-Mark documents you wanted. And this week's fund transfers. Right. I'd do them, but I don't have clearance to move that kind of money around. Yet. Right. Yet. They need to be approved by end of business, so don't forget. - Will do. That's it. Perfect. Wait. Hold it right there. I-M... T-H-E-M-A-N. " I'm the man." That's cute. That's his general I.D. that gets us into the main screen. We need his Harding transfer password. There it is. S-A-N-D-M-A-N. "Sandman." Why "sandman"? Because sand makes glass. This should be everything, Ms. Crawford. Bio-Mark corporation now has a full-service accaunt with Fulton Bank and Trust. Catchy name, Bio-Mark. - Thank you. You'll be seeing a lot of it in future. We just got funding to take us to market. Congratulations. There will be some large deposits in the next few weeks. Forty million dollars on the first... then $10 million every week for one year. We'll be ready for it. How long before we can transfer? As long as the funds originate stateside, you're looking at a day. Great. Thank you for choosing Fulton Bank. - I assure you... ...it was the only choice. I'd like a terminal, please. I'll need a credit card. - Sure. Ready to take a risk? - You ready to share one? No turning back. Let's do it. You know, I don't understand. If we have the password, why can't we wire the money straight to Switzerland? Forty million dollars sends up red flags. Your father's bank calls Doug for a verbal okay... ...and he won't give one unless the money is meant to be transferred. That gives us the 24 hours we need. Enter the Bio-Mark Corporation. And now the Fulton Bank of Washington... becomes the Fulton Bank and Trust. Good job. Lauren? Francine? I love you, Lauren. No, Clay, you don't. You love Francine Crawford. Doug? - Hey. What's up? The transfer protocol for Bio-Mark. Leland approved it. It just needs yours. I just got a phone with them. Fran Crawford asked when she can expect the transfer. Well, aren't they antsy. Forty million reasons to be. End of business. I'll let her know. Oh. A... I have a drink meeting. Is anything you need before I take off? A,... no, no. I'm all right. Miss Craford, pleaese. Lorene Bishop calling. Fran, hi. Lauren. So sorry to keep you guys waiting. Doug got on the ball. No, we haven't forgotten about you guys. The transfer should be there end of business tomorrow. Sure. No problem. You too. Well? - He's doing it now. Shit. - What's the matter? He's stuck on the bank info. - What do you mean "stuck"? Wait. Now he's holding up a pad. Oh, God. Fly. - What? He just killed a fly. Jesus, Clay, give me a heart attack. What's golng on? Clay? Clay? It's done. He did it. I can't believe it worked. Believe it. Pack everythlng out of there. Don't leave a trace. Yes, ma'am. Piece of cake. Leave some prints, won't you? It would be my pleasure. These are good. How do I know one day you don't get popped like smocked wind and the cops find records of me, and make me chains? I'm not an amateur. It's not Dicky Sacks you're talking to. I'm professional. I purge after every job. That's how I stay in business. Just to keep it professional, I brought a little bonus. This place yours, or do you rent? It's mine, Bob. It's all mine. Wow. Unbelievable. Could use a few naked girls around the pool. This chick I gotta fuck, it's not your mother, is it? No. No. She just doesn't get out of the house much. You're sort of a surprise for her. - Am I her type? Yeah, you're her type. You're her type. She really goes for a perfect set of teeth. Teeth? That's what gets this chick going, teeth? Yeah, perfect teeth. No cavities, not a one. What does not having cavities have to do with it? You got no dental records of consequence. Huh? Neither does Clay Harding. Excuse me. You look very familiar. I'm sorry. I'm sure I'd remember someone as lovely as you. Emily, right? You were here the other night with Clay Harding? You went to school together. Clay Harding? Darling, I really can't talk right now. I'm on the clock with a date. Call me if you'd like to get together sometime to talk. What's going on? I had to mess the place up a bit. I see that, Clay. Why? So you'd look despondent. That's how suicidal men live. Goddamn it. Give me the phone. And your gun. Eyes on the road. Harry bought too much Nakigomi stock on purpose, didn't he? And he had himself fired to be above suspicion. This has been a setup all along. And all that suspicion is gonna point right back to him... when they find Lauren's fingerprints in his apartment. Ironic, isn't it? All this just to piss off Daddy. Right up here. On the corner. Corner building. Park. Turn the car off. Get out. Mike? Come on, Manny, pick up. Pick up. Hello. - Who is this? Are you calllng for Emmanuel Molka? Yes, who is this? This is Detective Nick Perez. I'm gonna have to ask to know who you are. I have your number on the phone, ma'am. I can find out. Lauren. Lauren Bishop. Are you a relation, ma'am? I'm the closest thing he has to a relation. What's going on? Miss Bishop, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Your friend, it looks like he fell from a roof... ...he was working surveillance on. It appears he'd been drinking. I'm sorry for say that, ma'am. He did not survive the fall. - Oh, God. What's the matter? - Ma'am? Ma'am, are you stlll there? What should I do? Should I come down there? No, ma'am, not necessary. We're taking him to the morg for an autopsy. But If you could come down tomorrow to identify the body? Yes, of course. I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am. So am I. Thank you. Hey. What? It's Manny, Clay. He's dead. Fell off a roof. He was working, it was... I'm so sorry. I know how much he meant to you. Hey. It's gonna be okay. Hey. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. No, somebody could see you. - Who? Somebody. Somebody could see you come in. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all over after tonight. I'm gonna go to Paris. You're gonna meet me in one week. Hey. I love you. I love you too, Clay. I love you too. Get up. We have a lot to do today. What are you doing? It's bad luck to leave broken glass around. I never heard of that. And you, the heir to a glass fortune. Okay. Repeat it back to me. I got it right here, Lauren. Passwords, Fulton Bank, Swiss Bank, everything. I went to college, you know. I didn't do well, but I got in. You just have to keep logging in to see if it's cleared. Every half-hour or so. - Baby, I know. We have to make it appear like everything is normal. You said that. Right. - Not give them anything to worry about. Hey. Don't worry. It's gonna go fine. I'll call you on the cell phone when the money is in Switzerland. Okay? No turning back? - No turning back. Keep your eye on the ball. That's where the money is. Keep your eye on the ball. And who knows? What about you? You know? You know? Which one is it? What we got over here? Now you see it, now you don't. All right. Where is it, lady? I'm sorry, lady. I thought you won, really did. Like another chance? Not with a thief like you. - Now, now, now. Police! Police! - Come on. What'd you do that for? Look, I play an honest game. We needed a little privacy. - Say what? He's not gonna do what he's supposed to do. He's got another Swiss account. I need you to watch his hands. Get his password. Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand all right. You talking something in the neighborhood of three to five. I'm also talking money. - Yeah? How much? It's just a down payment. You name your price next time you see me. Believe me, it'll be a lot more than you expect. Is this Candid Camera? You a cop? - It's real. Fuck you. Well, if that's a deal breaker, that too. That's me. If I screw you, you can always turn me over to the cops. Get the information and meet me at that address. Just ask for me. Please, Jerry. Please say yes. All right. I'll take a look at what he does. One more thing. I need you to punch me in the eye. Say what? I need a bruise. It's quite essential. Taxi! Morning. Doug? My God, Lauren! What happened? - I fell into a bedpost. Doug, I had some really awful news last night. My friend was killed. I didn't know you considered him a friend. Mis. Bishop isn't talking about the same person. What's going on? Harry Burnham committed suicide. And Robert Harding's son... You remember Clay? There was an explosion at his house in Malibu. What the hell's going on in the world? That's what I'd like to know. May I have a few minutes of your time, Miss Bishop? Never did like those joint accounts. What you looking at? I'm telling you, I haven't talked to Harry in two months. And I don't even know Clay Harding socially at all. I've only seen him at once that meeting. You sure about that? - Yes. I don't know. It's just some freak coincidence or something. No, it's no coincidence for sure. - What do you mean? For one, Clay and Harry were best friends since college. Fraternity brothers. So, what are you saying... ...that Harry killed Clay and then killed himself? Interesting, but no. Mr. Molka fits a description of a man fleeing... ...from the building at Mr. Burnham's place last night. Do you know of any reason Mr. Molka... ...and Mr. Burnham could've known each other? Nope. How long have you known Mr. Molka? He was a childhood friend of my father's. So my whole life. So you know of his problems as a police officer? With taking bribes? - Of course. But Manny's been living the life of a monk for years. Yeah. Here's my problem, Ms. Bishop. Stop me before I go off the deep end here, but somehow all these deaths are connected... ...and the only one who's connected to all three is you. Fine. What do you want me to do? Confess that I killed them all? I heard that Manny is dead, and then... We're not accusing you of anything. - How did you get that bruise? He is. I told you. Bedpost. I talked to you on the phone, I felt faint and I fell. All right, Ms. Bishop. Take it easy and just calm down. Fuck you. - Miss. Bishop. What?! Yes, Bob? Yes. - It's done. I'm in a meeting right now. Is this very important? Call me when you can. Yes, okay, lunch will be fine. Where? I'll see you there. My friend Bob. Do you wanna question him as well? Not now Miss Veg. It's Miss. Crawford from Bio-Mark, ser. You said to interupt you... All right, tell her to hold. Excuse me for a minute. Excuse me. Robert Hardlng is on the line for Detectlve Perez. Did you wanna take lt? - I'll be right there. Well, Mr. De Winter? Shouldn't you be calling Robert Harding too? I beg your pardon? - Well, his son just died. If I were you, I'd make an effort. Keep his trust. I don't like your tone, Miss. Bishop. We don't condone that attitude here at De Winter & Hathaway. If I had balls you would. Lauren? - Yeah. I just got off the phone with Mrs. Crawford. Whenn did you tell her the money will be there? I said it'd clear at the end bussines today. Why? Nothing. She said you told her it would be sent today. No. Sent yesterday, clear today. It's banks, Doug, it takes a day. - I understand. You're telling me I can't do my job? - No, Lauren. No. It's just that... All this and the police. I know. I'm sorry. Yes? - There's a "Jerry" here for you. Right. Tell him I'll be right there. - Okay. Delivery. I didn't get a chance to eat this morning. Good morning, De Winter & Hathaway. Get me the hell out of here. - Come on, I'm very busy today. Can you hold, please? - You want something from the lobby? No, but... - Jerry. Good afternoon, De Winter & Hathaway. - Going down? Lauren. Where is she? - She's gone. She just left. It's Ms. Crawford again. - Not now. She said the funds aren't there. Not cleared, you mean? - No, I mean not there. Lauren! Lauren! Taxi! Airport, now. You got a set of brass ones, lady. Brass ones. So did you get it? - Yeah. Password? - Yeah. Saw the dollar amount too. A lot of zeros. How much do I get? - How does half sound? Hello. - Doug. Lauren. It's her. Doug, I did it. I admit it. I helped Clay steal the money. All right. Just tell me where you are. I'm scared. He's gonna klll me too. - Who? Clay. He's not dead, Doug. I saw him just this morning. He's killing people. I never said I'd... He hit me, Doug, he threatened me. He's gonna kill me too. - Ms. Bishop, we'll protect you. You have my word, just come back. - I fell in love. Where are you? - He's leaving tonight to Paris. Air France. - Tell me where you are. You catch him first. And then I'll come in. But you catch him first. Yes, dispatch, this is Detective Nick Perez. I need to patch me through to the Airport Police. They found her car at the bus station. It's got blood all over it. Samples in the trunk. Yeah, he got to her all right. Fakes his own death, points fingers at her. He kills her and dumps her so there's no trace. Like she did it all herself and skipped town. Smart little fucker. That Swiss account he's given us is empty. So, what's the story about that? Says that she stole it. - How? Says he doesn't know. Subtitles by SDI Media Group
