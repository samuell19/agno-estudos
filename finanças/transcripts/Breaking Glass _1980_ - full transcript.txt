I'm gonna inspect the sleeping quarters. - [Kate knocks] Good night. - [groans] [Mick] Where you going? [speaking German] [continues speaking German] Happy Christmas. Here, Sister, I got a confession to make to you. [brakes squealing] [Kate] Here. Christ, I'm freezing. No. If I drink any more brandy, I'll fall off me bloody bunk. [Kate] Can I borrow your blanket? I'm really cold. [Danny] Well, why don't you come up here, right? And I'll share your coat and you share my blankets? No, you come down here. It's easier. No, come here. Heat rises. There ain't no heat. Come on, I'll give you a hand. Ohh... [both groaning] - [thud] - [both laughing] - I'm here. - Come here. - Happy Christmas. - Happy Christmas. Ohh. So, what do you think? It's been a good year? Ain't been too bad, has it? We didn't achieve much. We haven't achieved anything. [rattling] I thought the train drivers were meant to be on strike? Maybe one of the nuns is having a bash. Right. This is quite sexy though, isn't it? You know what? I've been waiting and waiting to get to this for ages and ages. And now I've got to it, it's different. [brakes squeal] Let's get married. - [laughing] - No, no, no. All right then. - Should we just, um... - Bunk up for the night? Um, or we could just, like, sleep together, if you wanted to. Could ruin our relationship. No, I've got it all sorted out in my head. In my book as well. And it will not ruin our professional relationship. Scares me a bit. Does it? A bit. No need to be scared because... ...you what how I really think about you, don't you?

It's right off-the-wall. They are truly anarchic songs. - Anarchic? - Well, they are anarchic, aren't they? Well, you'd call yourself an anarchist, wouldn't you? In some ways. Well, what do you mean by anarchic? I know what I mean. What do you mean? Well, Mick's one of nature's anarchists, aren't ya? Go on, Mick, give him a flash. - It's disappeared. - [all laughing] Let me try and define what I mean by anarchist. I mean, someone who doesn't believe in government. Someone who believes in self-expression. Self-rule. Yeah, which brings us to some of the self-expression in your lyrics. Oh, yes. Go ahead. See, there's absolutely no way that we can get radio airplay for a song with the word "arse" in it. What, no "arse", eh? No. Happy birthday. Here, I have another one. Now, look... We believe "Big Brother" is a possible hit, OK? I mean, a real biggie. Now, Chris and I, and our house producer, we've discussed this one a lot. Now, he suggests, possibly "bum". I don't know what you think about that. Otherwise, we suggest that you substitute for the phrase "kick him up the arse", the phrase "punch him in the nose". All right? So it would go: "Punch him in the nose, nose, nose, nose, nose." [all laughing] All right, maybe that's not a very serious suggestion. I'll leave the lyrics entirely to you. But it's got a great beat. [chuckling continues] Uh, you'll have to excuse me. I'm getting a pain in the nose sitting here. - [band laughing] - [telephone ringing] - [door closes] - All right, let's get serious. - What's next? - Producer. [man] Oh, yeah. We don't want one. We'll do it ourselves. OK, let's try that for a bit. See how that goes. Fine. Now, look, I've drawn up a list of street gigs, rallies, political events coming up. I think it's fairly essential you attend some of those. - Well, yes. - [Chris] There's the anti-Fascist rally, there's an anti-plutonium meeting at Trafalgar Square, but the real must, the Rock Against 1984 in Notting Hill next month. You wouldn't want to miss that, would you? Wouldn't dream of it, comrade.

Kate certainly sings about something with songs like "Big Brother" and "Blackman". Now, here's the first question - coming through from... - [woman] Anita. Anita Price. Me and my friends have got all your records. And we want to know, is your music going on progressing in the same direction? Or are you moving away from the new wave? - Why are you asking that question? - What? Well, we all love it and it's changed a lot in the last few months, hasn't it? Well, yes. Yes, of course it has. Well, would you ever sing anyone else's material? If someone wrote something for you? I mean, do you have to believe in what you sing about? Well, yes. What do you mean? What are you trying to say? I think she means, uh, do you have to believe in what you sing about? [scoffs] Well, of course I do. That's a stupid question. You trying to catch me out or something? No! I just want to find out why your music's changed. Well, we're moving towards 1984. It's happening. 1984. Machines are taking over. Silicon chips. That's what I want to write about now. [man] Next question from David Wilken. [David] But the record companies choose what you do. It's them that control the material. Not you. No, the record companies don't control my material. I control. I control what I sing. They try to, but I control. Me! - [man] And the next caller. - [Danny] Kate? - Yes? - You sold out, haven't you? You pretended you were into one thing, but really you were into the ego trip, eh? - Danny, is that you? - Shit. Is that you, Danny? Danny? You poseur. You're just one of the shit. [Ken] Have you seen Kate lately? No. I don't mix with rock stars. You pulled out at a really bad time, you know? For Kate, Mick, me. It could still be all right though. Look, she wanted Woods as number one. The band wanted Woods as number one. Come on, I'm not ignorant. When things got a bit uncomfortable, you couldn't cope, could you? You screwed this all up. I mean, we were there, near enough. Wasn't enough for me. I don't like being treated like shit. Well, I thought you and Kate really had something. We did, till she changed. Yeah, maybe. But, we could always start again. No. We can't start again. - She'll want control. - You have to have control. That's what you mean, Dan.
