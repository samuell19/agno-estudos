THIS THING IS GIVING ME NIGHTMARES. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TESTIFIED. TONY LAZORKA, DIRECTOR HARRIS. WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS IS COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL. YOU KNOW THIS KID? I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. THAT'S BRIAN PENNY. 17 YEARS OLD. LOOKS KINDA LIKE THE GUY TEENAGE GIRLS BRING HOME TO PISS OFF THEIR PARENTS. SO WHAT'S HE GUILTY OF? WE THINK HE'S WORKING FOR THE CATANIA FAMILY. KID'S A PRO. HE'S A FREELANCE HACKER. SAME KID WE BELIEVE BROKE INTO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LAST YEAR AND ADJUSTED &quot;VALUES.&quot; NETTING HIS BENEFACTORS OVER 2.6 MILLION. BOY, I'D LIKE TO GET THIS LITTLE PUNK. I BET YOU WOULD. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I GOT WHEN I DOWNLOADED HIS FEDERAL FILES THIS MORNING. WELL, THE KID'S GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR. MM-HMM. HE COULDN'T RESIST MESSING WITH HIS RAP SHEET WHILE HE WAS IN OUR SYSTEM. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE SURE IT WAS HIM. KID'S A GENIUS. LAST NIGHT HE HACKED INTO OUR FBI WASHINGTON MAINFRAME AND DOWNLOADED THE ENTIRE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM DATABASE. REALLY. REALLY. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE'S WORKING FOR THE CATANIA'S? HALF THE CATANIA FAMILY WERE ON THE RED-EYE FROM NEW JERSEY TO LOS ANGELES THIS MORNING. WE THINK THE EXCHANGE OF THE LIST IS GOING DOWN SOME TIME WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE WERE KINDA HOPING YOU MIGHT KNOW WHERE. I GOT HOODS COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK, AND YOU WANNA KNOW IF I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GONNA MEET? NO, I DON'T. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOW IS THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY. WE CAN'T MOVE ANYONE YET. YOU CAN'T MOVE ANYONE? THERE'S NO AUTHORIZATION FROM WASHINGTON. OUR FOCUS IS INTERCEPTING THAT LIST, NOT CAUSING A PANIC AMONG WITNESSES. WE NEED THE POSSIBLE MEETING LOCATIONS WHERE THE CATANIA'S MIGHT MEET. MM-HMM. WELL, GOOD LUCK. JOHN. JOHN! I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. JOHN. JOHN! JOHN, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WEREN'T GONNA MOVE THE WITNESSES. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOU. I'LL TAKE CARE OF ME AND MY FAMILY. LOOK, JUST LET US HANDLE THIS! GODDAMN IT. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD MOVE HIS FAMILY FOR SAFETY REASONS? HE'S A KILLER, NOT YOUR FUCKING BOWLING PARTNER. TILL HE TESTIFIED, HE WAS THE CROWN PRINCE OF HIT MEN. GET THE LOCATION, THEN WE'LL NEGOTIATE. YES, SIR. DON'T GO. I'LL ONLY BE GONE FOR A DAY OR 2. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TIME. SARAH-- NO, I GOTTA SAY THIS. THERE'VE BEEN THINGS THAT I WONDERED ABOUT YOUR PAST. BUT I NEVER SAID ANYTHING. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE MY FAMILY. YOU AND AMBER. SHE CALLED YOU DADDY. OH, BABY. COME HERE. PLEASE DON'T GO. IF I'M NOT BACK BY MORNING, YOU GO TO YOUR MOTHER'S. I'LL MEET YOU THERE. WHAT IS IT? WHAT-- WHAT'S THE SECRET? MY SECRET... IS YOU AND AMBER ARE STUCK WITH ME. I'LL NEVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO US. I PROMISE YOU. [ENGINE STARTING] Man: MR. GARRETT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE CIA. SO, HOW ARE YA? WANT A DRINK? YOU LOOK ALL STRESSED. IF I LOOK STRESSED IT'S BECAUSE THAT ACCOUNTANT OF YOURS-- SEYMOUR THE PENNY-- TESTIFIES AGAINST YOU AND YOUR STUPID SON IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS AND HE'S STILL BREATHING. HE'S AS GOOD AS DEAD OR MY NAME ISN'T DOMINIC CATANIA. NOW, YOU'LL MAKE SURE I GET THE COMPLETE WITNESS LIST, RIGHT? YEAH. THAT KID'S GONNA GIVE THAT PENCIL PRICK'S ADDRESS TO YOUR SON PAOLO SO YOU CAN COMPLETE THIS JOB. HE'S ALSO GONNA GIVE YOU THE NEW NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE WISEGUY TONY LAZORKA. GOOD.

IF MY ORGANIZATION OR MYSELF GET DRAWN INTO THIS IN ANY WAY, YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ITALIAN-AMAGGOT FRIENDS ARE GONNA FIND YOURSELVES IN SHALLOW DITCHES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU GOT THAT? YOU GOTTA RELAX, RANDY. YOU'LL FEEL BETTER. IT'S THE STRESS THAT KILLS YOU. CAN'T BE. I'M SEEIN' A JERSEY GHOST HERE IN LA-LA LAND. LONG TIME, FRANCO.

THE FOSTER HOME WAS THE SAFEST PLACE TO RAISE YOU. I--I WAS AFRAID. [ALARM RINGING] BUT I NEVER FORGOT ABOUT YOU. [ALARM STOPS] DID YOU MEAN THAT OR WERE YOU JUST TRYING NOT TO GO TO HELL? TONY... DON'T DO THIS. DOMINIC, I CAN NEVER REPAY YOU FOR THE LIFE YOU GAVE ME, BUT I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU FOR TRYING TO KILL MY FAMILY, SO IT ALL STOPS HERE. SEYMOUR WILL TESTIFY, THE FAMILY IS DEAD, AND YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL. GET UP. AND, DOMINIC, THE NAME IS JOHN. I'D LIKE TO TRY... BEING A DAD AGAIN. YOU KNOW, MAKE UP FOR ALL THOSE LOST YEARS.
