In Support of Korea Creative Contents Agency a Studio Dadashow Film Original Story by Yeon Sang-ho, Choi Gyu-seok Written and Directed by Yeon Sang-ho In the barracks of Second Company near the cease-fire line, there's a squad room which used to be a snack supply room. The room has no windows. Window Room 6 headcount-report. 7 in all, 1 on duty... Cut it out and turn the light on. You hear me? Turn the light on! You bastard obey Jeong's words but not mine or what? No, sarge. I'm turning the light on. Hey, wake up! Wake up! Hey, Jeong Cheol-min! What were you doing? Haha... Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min! You do have a keen nose, staff sarge. Don't try to get away from this with a smile, bastard. Now, take it out. You're not upset, sarge? You bastards planned a party without me? What's the occasion? - It's Chang-soo's birthday today. - Corporal Lee Chang-soo! A corporal but still doing the chores, he'll kill himself if we don't celebrate his birthday. Hey, there must be more. Take it out. You upset me once, and that lasts for ages, you know. Are you specialized in military dog training, sarge? What a keen nose! Ugh, you dirty bastard hid it down there? Aah... It's good! Well, you guys have fun, and just stay out of trouble. Got it? You know we always do, sarge. Yeah, right. You and your confidence... - Well, Chang-soo. - Corporal Lee Chang-soo! Happy birthday, Enjoy your party food, Wait, don't you guys play in the battalion foot-volleyball finals tomorrow? Can you drink tonight and still make it? No problem, sarge. We're celebrating our victory already. Jeong Cheol-min My Motto: "Run hard, play hard." This squad is the next cease-fire line shift and all of us were very close in rank. Most of us were sergeants, and the lowest in rank was a corporal. Hey, Lee Ju-won! Do it right, will you? Sergeant Lee Ju-won! Yes, I'll do it right! Hey, Chang-soo! Lee Chang-soo! Kick it higher! Higher! In the community of the ranks, there's only a thin line between private and public matters. So we were colleagues, friends and a family on the same boat, doing what's best for one another. And I was doing the same Now, an award will be given to the winners of the battalion foot-volleyball finals. In loyalty we trust! Well, good. Didn't your squad win in the finals last year as well, Cheol-min? Having you as the leader, your squad has become even better. Take it easy, so others can have a chance to win as well. Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min! This squad always does its best! We just don't take things easy, sir! Oh? You're right. - Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min! - Cheol-min. You've been always reliable. You're a good soldier. Run hard, play hard. Does it sound silly? But it's the only way you can find some meaning and happiness in this place. Come in. In loyalty we trust! Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min! - I was called to the administration office. - Ah, Cheol-min. Have a seat. - Congrats on your winning. - Thank you, sir. Well... It's been a long time since you had a newcomer in your squad, hasn't it? Yes, sir. Chang-soo came over a year ago, so... There's a newcomer who just joined us and it seems he had problems even in the boot camp. The battalion commander told me today to place him in your squad. You're so good at your work that he's counting on you, I guess. Anyway, keep an eye on him. Oh... Yes, I will, sir. Hey, where's your gun? Haven't you got one from the boot camp? You won't answer me or what? Sergeant Jeong, we have a newcomer. So, you're the new guy. Private Hong Young-soo... Well, nice to meet you, Young-soo. Let's try to work things out. Um... Have a good look, ok? I'll do it all over again. What was this? Private Hong Young-soo. Um... I'm not sure, corporal. How come? I told you just a minute ago! I'm telling you again. It's a flash suppresser. You got it? Hong Young-soo was a so-called 'torturer'. Plus, even his superior just above him in rank has served in the army for over a year, which means he'll have his superiors discharged soon and be one himself. Repeat after me: flash suppresser. Flash suppresser. Gee... In loyalty we trust! Have a good day, sarge! In loyalty we trust! Have a good day, sarge! You brat... You should salute properly. He's the highest in rank of this squad. Sarge, I've come for the change in the request for a day off. So In-soo asked for a day off? Yes, It's Hak-gyu's turn but he backed down. I see. You can go now. Yes, sarge. In loyalty we trust! Sergeant Choi! Isn't In-soo the torturer who had a day off lately? Yes, he is. He said his mother was ill to take a day off, and returned drunk with his girlfriend, you know. Damn... So what? That wily brat plays his petty tricks all the time. You shouldn't take Hak-gyu's day off chance away to send him out, sarge. You know Hak-gyu works hard and behaves the best. Look, his mother is ill again. He's so worried that he can't even sleep. What else could I do? And seriously, you believe it, sarge? It's obvious he's going out to meet his girl! And Hak-gyu was really looking forward to this day off, you know. Look, Hak-gyu can live with it and still do well in the army. Cheol-min. I've got only 32 days to leave the army. What if I don't let this nutcase go and he makes a mess? I can't risk it. Take it easy, so this little bro can leave in peace. Will you? Big bro Cheol-min? I heard you got such nutcase in your squad, too. Do not mess with him. You have only a few months to go. Relax, you know. Just relax. But we shouldn't ignore this as if it's a joke. Oh, what the hell! It's time to watch TV. Isn't there a TV break tonight? Talk to the daytime duty later. Good night, Sergeant Jeong. It's mean. A mean, irresponsible thing to say. It's not the ones who do their best but the mean cowards that get reward, and I should take it for granted? Well, let's try one more time. What was this again? I'm not sure, corporal. Damn! It's a flash suppresser. A flash suppresser, bastard! Are you a fool? Huh? State your official rank and name! Private Hong Young-soo. Are you the first sergeant or what? You'd better do it loud and clear. From now on, you'll learn everything you need to know from me. And we'll do physical training every night. You got it? Yes, sarge! Work your guts out, bastard. You hear me? Yes, sarge! Examine it from beginning to end. The charging handle, the breech block, the pistol grip, the Fla..., the Fla... It's the flash suppresser, bastard. You always get stuck there. Just like that, whether it was his will or not, Young-soo began to adapt himself to life in the army. There's a big difference between actions at daytime and nighttime. Well then, who can tell me what to do respectively when an illuminating shell and a trip flare burst? Anyone? No one? Even you sergeants are not helping... Well then, if any private gets the right answer, he'll get a day off next month. Private Hong Young-soo! Oh, Young-soo. You need to go to the bathroom? I'd like to try to answer, sir. Uh? Ok then, give it a try. When an illuminating shell bursts, we grasp the flash suppresser instantly and lie face down, still on the ground. When a trip flare bursts, we leave that position immediately. Just like that, my little utopia was coming closer to perfection. Wake up! Wake up! Fast pace! Fast pace! Wake up! Wake up! From tomorrow, this company will have a readiness condition exercise. Let's go fast! Hurry up! Hey, Chang-soo. Bring some camouflage cream. Yes, sarge! The division commander comes to visit this company's disposal area, so let's do this right. You got it? Ready? Then get the ammunition boxes first! Fast! Go! Hurry up! You bastard lack of discipline... Gee... I really had enough of this. Well, why is it this company that has to do the sudden exercise, sarge? Because the company commander isn't high enough in rank. Why else would he make us do this when we're about to take the next cease-fire line shift? Maybe he's just anxious to get a promotion. If he doesn't make it this time, we're screwed, you know. Hope this will be over soon, though. I'm not sure. It'll last until lunchtime at least. Sergeant Jeong, it's the old man's car! Gee... The division commander is coming indeed. Let's do this act right. This way, sir. Squad, attention! Present arms! In loyalty we trust! Thank you, soldiers. It must be hard to work on this hot day. Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min! Not at all, sir! Ah, you must be the squad leader. Sir, yes, sir! Well, I've come all the way here, so let's see how well prepared my soldiers are. Give me two soldiers you can count on, sergeant. At that very moment, I figured out what would be the safest. May I recommend myself, the leader, and private Hong Young-soo, the latest newcomer of this squad, sir? Well, good. The highest and the lowest in rank, that should be enough. Second Company Commander, examine their field packs. First Lieutenant Kim Jeong-ho! Yes, sir! Well, you did pack very thoroughly. Now, let's see the newcomer's pack. Do it properly, bastards! You bastards lack of discipline. Who says you can move? When the company commander looked uneasily at me, I smiled with confidence. But in Hong Young-soo's pack, there were only two bear suits, hardtack and plastic bags filled with air. Hmm... You brats! - Hey. Shut the door. - Yes, sarge. - Hong Young-soo. - Private Hong Young-soo! Shut up! You son of a bitch! From now on, you can't state your rank and name. Hey, was the full pack that heavy? Huh? Fucking bastard ...I thought you're stupid but you must be quite smart. Huh? I'd never thought of such thing. You fucking bastard! Hands down, bastard! Does it hurt? Huh? Does this hurt? You can feel the pain but don't know others can as well, bastard? You scumbag... So you don't care about others as long as you don't suffer? You're comfortable, and that's it? Fucking bastard! I hate guys like you the most. You scumbag! Don't do anything, anymore. You're not a human being anymore. Do not state your rank and name. Do not work! Don't do anything, bastard! Corporal Lee! Corporal Lee! Corporal Lee! Ah... Is it already my turn of duty? Why are you waking me up instead of Young-soo? Where is he? Corporal Lee! Young-soo... Young-soo killed himself! What? He killed himself? Urgh... I'm doomed! Sergeant Jeong, Sergeant Jeong! Young-soo killed himself! I heard. Hey, turn the light on! Lights on! - Hong Young-soo killed himself? - What the hell...? Fuck! We're fucked up! - What happens now? - We're fucked up! Sergeant Jeong, the company commander wants you. Hey, did Hong Young-soo really die? No, sarge. He made a suicide attempt but failed. Shit... Tell me in more detail. Young-soo was supposed to do his guard duty with Chang-soo, so I woke him up and he went to the bathroom, but didn't come out. I went in to the stall next to him to have a look and found him down, his wrist slit with a cutter. Slit his wrist? How badly? The cut didn't look so deep. At first glance I was too shocked to notice it, but he didn't bleed much. That bastard made a feint! You've contacted the battalion over such trifling matter? Crazy bastard! I'm very sorry, sir. I was too shocked earlier... In loyalty we trust! Sergeant Jeong Chul... Ah, Chul-min. Come on over. We need to get our story straight before the battalion commander arrives. It's not even a suicide anyway. Young-soo has been always weird. We should tell the commander how weird he has been, in detail. For example, that he used to be shaking with fear when seeing a gun, or was rude when talking to his superior. Something like that, adding a bit on it. And leave out the get-downs I gave in the evening. Yes, sir. How is he? In royalty we trust! The wound is not a big deal, sir. Then why is he still unconscious? I'm not sure, sir. It must be the shock. In royalty we trust! Commander, the battalion commander has arrived. I see. Hey you, medic! Come with me and explain the situation. Yes, sir! Hey, Hong Young-soo. I know you're awake. Get up. Do you really have to do this? Oh my... This strange new guy is really a pain in the neck. Cheol-min, you must have gone through a lot because of Young-soo. If he was directly under my control, I'd have made a real soldier of him. Given the job, you must have had a hard time. He did, sir. Sergeant Jeong really did his best to train this guy... - Keep still, commander. - Oh... So, Cheol-min. Why didn't you teach him a tiny lesson when he wasn't listening to you? Huh? Like tapping him on the head, to make him listen, you know. You should've tried it. Huh? I did try sometimes but... Oh, you did? You used to tap him on his head or so? Sometimes, when he wasn't listening to the order. Well, I see. So you did. Second Company Commander, arrest him immediately! Who the hell are you, commander? You don't have a clue or what? Yes, I have, sir. A matter like this need to be punished severely as a warning to others. We'll eradicate beatings and harsh treatment from the army this time. Second Company Commander! Do not let this bastard sleep! Question him thoroughly until you find out how he did it and make a full report! Yes, sir! I'll report after a full investigation. I knew you bastard would make trouble. Twenty hours... And I've been saying the same thing over again. - Maybe it wasn't the same thing. - You drank and enjoyed everything you could, bastard. - I can't remember at all what I said a moment ago. - Just talk and get through with this. You get it? I must have been endlessly repeating to myself, "I'm a fool." Are you not answering me? Where's this confident Jeong I know? Huh? - Hong Young-soo's attempted suicide... - After 35 hours of questioning, a week went by. The cause of Private Hong Young-soo's attempted suicide The whole story goes like this. The whole story goes like this. Hong Young-soo got just transferred, having a hard time to adapt himself to the army. The reason is that the squad room, unlike others, has no windows, which makes it easy to avoid surveillance of the superiors. Therefore, it has been difficult to prevent beatings from occurring, and it appears having late-night snacks and drinking against rules have happened openly. More crucially, on the day of Hong Young-soo's attempted suicide, Squad Leader Jeong Cheol-min had beaten Hong in front of the squad members. Additionally, Hong Young-soo's superior, Lee Chang-soo, has been beating Hong habitually at place of duty. As the punishment for such behaviors, Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min and Corporal Lee Chang-soo will be put into jail for 15 and 10 days respectively. The rest of the squad will be sent to the discipline camp for 7 days. Second Company, Second Platoon, First Squad will be dissolved and reorganized. One. Two. Three. In a place where time passes even more slowly than in the boot camp, I've thought over for 15 days whose sin I am actually paying for. When I got back after paying for someone else's sin, a small, newly-made window greeted me mockingly. In my place that has turned into a strangers' paradise, I lied like a dead body and spent the remaining days of my army life. Oh, Well... Now you are getting discharged, Cheol-min. It must have been very disappointing to see others of your rank leaving in time. If this strange new guy had not come at the last moment... I have him as my orderly man now, and he's so irritating to drive me crazy, you know. My luck in having good men comes and goes, I guess. Well then, just forget all what happened here and go out into the world to try your best. You were the best even in the army, Cheol-min. Unit, attention! Salute to the commander! In loyalty we trust! I'm getting discharged. Let me ask you one thing. You... Do you feel comfortable now? I'm off. Take care. It's... Uh...? It... It's... It's... It is comfortable! I feel much more comfortable than when I was with you, Sergeant Jeong! All right? English Subtitles by Hwang Hei-rim
