This is for the chosen one. Follow my instructions. Don't worry. I will do the rest. Yes, Master. I count on you. I will do everything, Master. Now you can go. Svetlana... Hello! Hello. Andrej... Well... I would like to consult my Tarot to see what brought you to me. What? By the way, today is October, 31rd. It's our son Stepan's birthday. He is 25 years old now! Here, we would like to give him something unusual. What are you interested in? A Book about magic ..., Taro Cards... Or something more specific? Don't look at me! You know how skeptical I am to these things... All these: Taro... astrology... magic... are just symbolic archetypes of our subconsciousness. We created them ourselves. Yes, yes... I too studied Carl Gustav Jung at the University. Just like you! And I remember those times very well. But I learned so much since then! Good for you! But I'm a man of science. I'm a psychiatrist, not a magician. I believe only in the trials. Do you have any evidence? How do you live with him? How can you stand him? I don't even know! Andrej, you're a really boring man! Would you like to talk about it with a psychiatrist? I think you are hiding something to me. You're probably in love with me. I would not fall for you not even... I will be dead! Never say never! Stop you two! We're here for Stepan's gift. We need something unique cause Stepan loves magic. Well. Let me think... Perhaps I have something unusual. But I'm not sure that Stepan will like. It is about occult forces. Wait a minute! Olga... Olga! Bring me the package... what you know. The special one. Olga will now bring us something really special... This is one of the strangest things I have in my shop. Good morning. Here it is. Thank you. You are welcome. A voodoo doll. Don't be fooled by appearances. I am sure that it was used for real. Voodoo doll has a powerful magic power. Maybe Stepan will like it. But is not it dangerous? It's not dangerous if you know how to use it. This is the manual. Here we go! May I have a look? "Rahab, Ghenam..." Is it Latin? "Rahab" "Ghenam" "Semper stat" "Nubilata lux" "Uetag" "Bipahié" "El Mauta" "Ut" "Damnatione cum magna haraab!" Did you understand? Yes... I got it. I think this gift is too dangerous. There is no danger! The doll doesn't work until a real blood sacrifice is made. A blood sacrifice... Exactly! See this nail? It is full of rust. If our son injures a finger, he may have an infection. He's so distracted! It's impossible to talk to you seriously. Forget it... He does not believe in these things. Fortunately, your child looks like you! Thank goodness. So what do we do? All right, I give up. I don't discuss anymore. The doll is OK. How much does it cost? If Stepan gets hurt, he will use a band-aid. How much? A special price for you. 300 rubles. 300!?! You are able to sell this stuff not only to us, but also to the devil! It's a right price for a Halloween gift. Olga... Olga! Come here, darling! Please make a package for my friends. This is the address: Volodin Stepan Koptevskaya st., 23. Right? Apartment 13. Well. Olga will deliver the voodoo doll in half an hour. Well. Hey, friends. I have a great idea. I've had enough of the work today. I have nothing more to do. You want us to go... to sit in a café. I will give you a reading of the cards there! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Stepan! Happy birthday... Well, guys. Let's open the gifts in order. Agree? Whose is this? It's mine, dear. Did you hear the girlfriend? Wow... baby! Beautiful! Thank you very much! How do I look? Disgusting. You could not choose something worse! Fuck you, Yuri! Come on, guys, stop it. We see all the presents. Keep your comments for later. Ok? Whose gift is this? It's mine... mine... look at it! Is heavy! Is it intellectual stuff? A book? Yes... yes... Ah, I see. Now I know what to read at the toilet. No, Lena... thank you so much, really! Well! Now you can not shit without a book... Shut up, asshole! Where is your gift? It's very smelly... Ugly ape! Look inside. I thought a lot about how to liven up your boring sex life. These should help you. You are a maniac... Daniil, kill him! Guys, remember it's my birthday. Stop having fun without me! Whose is this? It's mine. It's very light... What do you mean? Is there a rag inside? Wow, cool! Let me try it now. How am I? You're horrible as always, but in addition you also have a shirt on. Yes, yes... it's okay. Now we eat the cake, but the biggest slice is mine! One moment... where is my present? Sure, where is Yuri's gift? Lena!!! Oh, I'm sorry... Excuse me! You sat on! Be careful where you put your precious ass! Excuse me, I had not noticed. It's all yours! The gift or the ass? It's beautiful. What is it? Today is Halloween and also your birthday. Guess ..., what is it? I don't know. What's inside? Guess... Or open it. Guys, I know what is it! It's an Ouija board. Fantastic! It serves to connect with the spirits. You believe in this crap? I'm not like you. I'm a refined intellectual. Silence, you two! How does it work? Look... This is the board... the letters... the numbers... the words: yes and no. This is the 'planchette'. You must call the spirit. Ask a question. Put your hands on the planchette. The spirit will move it.. Oh, it's so cool! It is funny. Let's try! Ok, but you are warned: the one who is afraid and screams pay pledge. Ok, Yuri. Let's drink another beer before starting with the spirits. Father... Daddy! Come here: Don't be afraid, son. Come... Be a man! No, daddy! Don't do it. Look at me! You see? It's my hand. Look here. Give me your hand now! No, please. No! Give me your hand. No! Give me your hand! It's an order! Look... now nobody can ever separate us, my son. Let's go, my son. Come on, dear... Gera, stop it! Why? Don't you like my knife? I don't like you pull it out every time. It's not your dick! You are envious of my cock. Pussy! Shut up. Fagot! Gera, really. That's enough! Put this fucking knife away! I do not want to spend all day and especially this evening drunk in front of the television. Because of you. Take out an idea. What could we do then? We could go to the cinema... What a fucking idea! My ideas are better than yours. Your head is just full of shit. Hey, keep your mouth shut! That's enough. Calm down! Put your knife away and finish it. Hey! Look at that candy! Just what we wanted. A nice pussy to solve this bad day. Leave it to me. Now I'll show you how to catch a chick... Hey princess, where are you going all alone? Put your hands down! I'm kind, don't you see? I'm a good boy! Don't touch me! Come on, don't make such a fuss! I'm ok! I am a good boy, don't you see? First of all she saw you're drunk. Hey, bitch! I'll break your pretty little face! And don't make a fuss... Help! Help, someone help me, please! Wow! How pretty! Leave me alone! Gera, stop it! Zhorik?! I know her: she lives in my neighborhood. You know this chick and you never presented her? You really are a bastard! Stop, baby. Stop! Gera, you're completely drunk. Calm down. Better to be drunk than an idiot like you! Let me go! I'm late! Please! That's enough! Let her go! Give me that package! Please, give it back to me! I have to deliver it now! I'm late! 'Stepan Volodin. Koptevskaya st.'. What's it? Let see... let see... I told you to give it back to me! Let see. What's inside? What is it? A stupid doll. A fucking doll...! Baby, don't try to fool me... I don't like bad girls at all. And you are so sweet... Come and get your doll back from your daddy! What do we do now? I don't like this story. I know her. I'll have trouble... Did you really have to make a mess ...? Fagot! What did you say? Asshole! I'll kill you! You are crazy, asshole! Put that knife away! Zhorik and I will have problems because of you. Put that knife away! Collect this stuff! What's the fucking address where to deliver this shit? We have to go to her place, now! Read the address! Koptevskaya st., 23. Where is it? It's in the center, I know the place. Put this shit into the package and let's go. Today is Halloween! And I am not a fucking postman! Fuck! You will do the postman, the courier, and both together! We are in trouble because of you! What a fucking day! Good afternoon... What would you like to drink? For me coffee, please. A glass of red wine. And for you? A coffee for me too. Just a moment. So ..., who is the first? Don't look at me like that: It's useless. I'm not your customer. I don't like this mumbo jumbo... Don't mind... He believes only in his medical books. You know, it would be easier for you if you use your imagination a little... You have so fear of your dark sides! I live constantly in the darkness, Svetlana. My psychiatrist job is full of dark sides. It's so rare case to shed some light into the chaos that surrounds me! If you used more your imagination and your sensitivity I think they would also help you in your work. But you are so scared of these things... All right. I'm grateful anyway because you brought me Roxana... And you bought the gift for Stepan in my shop. What can I expect more from a rational man like you? I'll read the Tarot cards to Roxana... Okay? Sure, sure ...! I belief in these things. This is why you are friends... Don't listen to him! Give me the cards. Let's start... What do you want to know about you? Focus on your question. Think about it intensely. Well. I try. Will I eventually become director of the library? Let me lay down the cards. These positions represent the past, the present, the future. Do you want to leave them as they are or exchange them? Let them... let them... Well. The High Priestess ..., the Force... the Pope. They are beautiful cards! They mean that everything will be fine for you in the future and that everything has been well prepared in the past. Really? Yes. They indicate that you have been very persevering in the past. You are continuing well in the present... And you will reach your goal quickly. Your future will be radiant. The Pope represents the perfect balance between body and spirit. The forces that govern your mind are perfectly balanced. Great! Did you hear, honey? I'm perfectly balanced! Incredible!! Does this mean that from now on you will pay your bills alone? Come on... Try to be serious sometimes! What Andrej calls absurdity is only vivid fantasy. But it's something that a doctor can not understand. So, you saw how it works... Do you want to ask something too? No, no... Never! I leave you both these ridiculous pleasures. Ok. Please, tell me something about Stepan's future... Listen... I have enough. I don't want to hear anything anymore. Let's go to the café. What do you want to know about Stepan? When will he finally be able to graduate? Good question! Will your child get a degree? You're smart to ask for it... Go ahead. Don't interrupt! Why are you asking me this? Well, he had problems with exams last year... It was hard. Your son attends more the parties than the lessons at the university. I would like to remind you that he is also 'your' son. Well... While you ask the cards for the fate of 'our' son, I drink something. Yes, yes, drink and don't disturb us. We don't need you here! Stop arguing! Now I will do the cards for Stepan even if he is not here. Stepan... Stepan... Stepan... Who wants to start? Can I try? If you want... Close your eyes. Put your right hand on the planchette above my hand. Lena, now tell me... who is your guide in the spirit world. But I don't know who my guide in the spirit world is! In fact, you don't know it... You have to concentrate and ask for it at the Ouija table. Who is my guide in the spirit world? No! You must speak to the spirit directly and ask himself who he is. Clear? Spirit, tell me... Are you here with us? Oh... have you seen? He replied 'yes'. Well. We have established the connection. Ask what's his name. What's your name? Sybil... Sybil? Is your name Sybil? Yes... yes... Cool! And now? Ask something else. How old are you? 30? 300! Are you 300 years old? Guys, what are you asking? We can't control the answers! Who is this fucking Sybil? It could be a trick. Come on ..., assholes ...! She was my guide in the other dimension! And you interrupted the communication! Now she will not come back! Why did you do this? Don't listen to these two idiots. Ok, today is your birthday. I forgive you. Do you want to give him even a kiss? Do you want to try it now? Ok. Spirit, are you here? Reply: are you here? Fuck... are you here or not? Have you seen, guys? I always thought that using decisive ways you will get the best results. Who are you? Zot. Did you tell us your name is Zot? Yes. Come on... what a fucking name! Let's see how good you are to know me... What is my date of birth? 31... He guessed it! You are well informed! I'll ask you a more difficult question: what's my father's job? Unbelievable..., fantastic! Doctor. You know my family very well. Ok, Zot... now enough with the games! Now I'll ask you a difficult question... Tell me... There's something really secret... that we only know you and me? Yes. What is it? Tell me, Zot. A scar. A scar ..., fuck! A scar. How does this fucking board know that I have a scar? What's happened? Wait... I'm going to see. Are you OK? Yes, of course. I'm just a little impressed. You know ..., I got hurt when I was little. It was a serious accident. Few people know it. It's strange. But sometimes spirits know more than we believe. Do you want to stop the session? No, no. Sure? Yes. Go back to the table? Ok. Stepan decided to continue the session. Stepan, do you want to ask for something even more specific? Yes Ask the question. Well. Zot, tell me..., what do you want from me? Meet you! Oh, heaven ...! He wants to meet you! Stepan... Stepan ...? Stepan... hi, honey. Mum! You scared me! Damn! Dear, I didn't mean to scare you. Ok ..., ok... what's the problem? Why did you call me? Are you ok? Yes, everything is fine. I forgot to tell you that Olga... Do you remember Olga? The girl from Svetlana's shop ...? Are you telling me that the girl from Svetlana's store is coming here and that she will bring me your present? Yes. But are you at home now? Yes, I'm at home with my friends. Ok. Olga will arrive soon. All right. Bye. I kiss you. Guys... it was not Zot, she was my mom. Someone will come here soon with another birthday present. Anyway ..., Zot said he wants to meet me, but he didn't say where. You can always ask him. Ok. Let's get back to the Ouija table. So ..., Zot, confirm that you want to meet me? 'Yes'. Where? Niki, write! Zavodskoy tupik, 13. Zavodskoy tupik, 13 Yes. I wrote it. So, how are Stepan's cards? Tower ..., Devil ..., Fool... Dark forces surround Stepan. What does it mean? Nothing. The cards are lying. Just lying! Svetlana! So. Done. A little symbolic blood... ... for sacrifice. Thus evil spirits will be satisfied. Ok. Zavodskoy tupik is quite far from here. We should take the subway. I know that area ..., there are many old buildings. A nice place for spirits. We can even just go and have a look. It's Halloween, if we do not likethe placet we'll leave. So, who is ready to meet Zot? I don't want to go to that disgusting place... Come on! It's Halloween: it will be fun! No, I don't want to go! I stay here. How boring you are! Stepan, forget it. This thing scares me. What are you afraid of? You are with me. You can always hide behind me. Nobody will hurt you! Don't forget that today is my birthday. You should agree with me! And then you don't want me to meet Zot alone! But I don't want to come! You know, however, what should you say? Dear Stepan, I'd love to go with you to meet this evil and horrible Zot! Alright then... Perfect! Now you're really a good girl! Have you heard everyone? Niki is fine. So, we can go! Let's go! What do you intend to do? What do you want me to do? I accompany you! I can not leave you alone with these idiots. Guys, wait. I have to leave a message to Olga. She is bringing me the gift of my parents. Stepan, then, have you finished? I'm coming. Stepan, hurry up! Or you have to pay a pledge! Nothing to do: today is my birthday! Hello Mom. Yes, tell me... I'm going out to have fun with my friends. Don't worry, it's all right. I leave a message for Olga. Where are we going? We're heading to Zavodskoy st., 13. It's Halloween evening! Let's go meet the spirits! Ok, ok. Don't worry. Now I have to go. All the others are waiting for me. Bye. 'For Olga: we are in Zadovskoy st., 13. Stepan Volodin'. Have you finished with your things? Can we go? Your son is behaving as usual. 'Мy' son? I think he's also 'yours', right? What happened this time? He didn't wait for Olga and went out. Where is he gone? He said he was going to a certain Zavodskoy st., 13. To meet the spirits! Stepan is behaving as usual: he creates problems for others. And the gift? He left a ticket at the door for Olga. So the poor girl has to go to another address. Olga is young: she will manage it. So, we don't have to go to his birthday party? We are free ..., right? How about the theater? It's a wonderful idea. Let's go there? Let's go. Svetlana, I'm nervous. Tell me more about Stepan. Everything is all right? Don't worry about my Tarot... Everithing is all right. It's better if we reach Andrej before he's jealous. It would be something new for us... Would you like to add some pepper to your thirty years of marriage? Why not? Thank you. Hey guys. We are here! What a shitty place! Daniil, are you sure it's the right place? I don't know ..., but GPS indicates here. I told you not to come here... Let's leave, please. This place is empty. There is nobody. Stepan, go away from this place. Let's take a look, first. Daniil, go to see! Why me? It's up to him! It's up to you because it's Stepan's birthday. He is out of the game. And you arrived last at the metro. Alright then. But wait for me here. Of course we'll wait for you. And don't make stupid jokes! Go... coward! Stepan, let's get away from here... Let's wait for Daniil and then we will leave. Promised. Guys, there's a Quest's door. A Quest? Yes, a Quest. It's a role-playing game for groups. Sounds cool! Maybe Zot wants to play with us. Exactly! This is the reason why it is better to leave immediately. Is it opened? Yes. Let's take a look! You promised me we would leave! Of course, but first let's take a look. Then we leave. Raise your hand if you agree. I knew it would end like this. You're crazy, guys. What the hell did we come here to do? You think only of yourselves. You are selfish! Try at least to hurry up. Well... go! This way. What should we do with this? Clean up your ass? Shut up! Read the address. Zavodskoy tupik, 13. I don't know this address. Let's go. We will find it. It will be on the other side of Moscow. Why the fuck are we going there? Shut up, asshole! We're shoveling your shit. Next time do what I tell you. Ok. Let's go. Look at where you put your feet! It seems a place interesting. I wonder if there is anyone in here. Why don't you sit down? Why not? Guys... Guys... look! Are you here for the Quest? Yes. Right. Welcome. The Game Master will be here in a minute. Guys, we have not booked for this Quest. What is the problem? It's only a game. You go in, pay the ticket and that's all. Exactly, relax: we will pay later. Sure. Let's have fun tonight. Ok? I think you are out of your mind. Come on, let them lose. They decided so. You can not change their mind. Cool! Unbelievable... Absurd! Happy Halloween! We are happy to have you here. I am the Game Master. Is it your first Quest? Yes, yes. Well. There is always a first time... This Quest is called 'Escape from the Asylum'. Clear? Yes, yes... These are my helpers. They will be your guards. You will find some lamps on your way. For your safety, there are infrared cameras and microphones everywhere. If things become too difficult for you, you can look at the cameras and ask for help. Don't worry about payment... today all is free. Finally, the last rule: no phones! Stepan... let's play? Ok. All right. Well. Give your phones. I'm a bit scared. Come on, these are the rules of the game. I agree with Daniil. I don't like this situation. We are ready to start. Get in line. You are the first. Go ahead. Why me? Come on. Go... Quick, guys. Don't push me! Oh, fuck! Can we avoid these bags on the head? Why do we have to wear them? I hope no one died inside. Stop complaining! Finally you did it! I'm scared. Take it away from me! Can you see something? No! I see nothing. I don't want to be the first! And I don't want to be the last in line. And now what happens? Do you see something? No! Silence... silence... Let's start? Careful not to stumble! Be careful! Guys, I'm scared! Be careful! Which stinks in here! Are you comfortable? Nooooo! Perfect. You are chained in the first corridor of the asylum. Why are we chained? Good question! Because one of you has committed a terrible crime. I wonder who was. If I told you, it would be too easy. You must find a way to free yourself, solve puzzles and find the exit. But it is not easy. In here there are cannibals and servants of the devil! What? I wish you didn't meet them. To help you I leave you the key to the handcuffs. And a lamp. If you can get them. Good luck. Peter stop touching me! I'm not touching you! I just try to understand how long this piece of iron is! Shut up. Guys, let's invent something good or we'll stay chained here until tomorrow morning. Bend down! Just do it! Come on! You are closer... Try now! One more time. I can not reach the key. She's in the middle! You're crushing me! Stop arguing! We just have to get those fucking keys! Yuri, please, find a solution! Ok, I'm trying. It's useless. We have to think about something else. I try to take this... Here, I have it! What... what... where? Shut up, I'm working on it. Get moving, Peter! I'll take it! Good, good! Lena, try... can you get the keys with this stick? Come on! Take them! Finally! Good! Come on! Let's get rid of these stupid chains! Are you all free? Yes! Listen ..., someone is coming. Is there anyone! Let's move! Close the door! Close the door! Guys, we lost Niki! When? Maybe they caught her. What are we doing now? It's a disaster! It's so delicate! Stepan, don't worry: it's just a game. They will not hurt her. A game? I told you to let it go! Listen... Niki! Silence! Niki... She's there. Niki ..., honey. Niki, did they hurt you? Are you ok? I don't feel good... Where are you, Niki? I don't know. I'm locked in a room. What do you see, Niki? There is light and a piano. Can you open the door? No, I can't. Play the piano. We will find you! Start playing. Come on ..., come on! Shit. Cool! Guys, look! Oh! Yes..., guys! A trapdoor! Have you seen these masks? Yes, they are really scary. I don't like them. Fuck, this is a narrow place! Niki, we're coming. Shit, we suffocate here! We have to go out... Guys, I found another trapdoor. Can you open it? I can't do it... it's stuck. There! Guys, it's opening up now. Here we are! I made it. Niki! Be careful. Niki... Help me. Be careful. Come on! Come on! Stepan... Are you here? Niki, are you here? Stop joking, Peter! Niki, Niki... we arrive! Niki... Niki... let's get there. Now I break the door! Stepan, wait. You can't break the door. It's forbidden: this it's only a game! Stepan, Lena is right. Game Master told us to find some keys. It makes sense, don't you think? Ok, look for the keys. But if you don't find them, I'll break the door! Calm. Let me find these fucking keys. Give me the lamp! And you don't scream! Enough with the bickering. Search! Niki, baby! We find the keys and we come to you. Stepan, I'm scared! Don't worry. Keep calm. Guys, do you have these keys? Not yet. Did you find something? Yes I have. I found them! They work! Let's enter. Dear... Forgive me my love. Did they hurt you? No. Everything is fine. Where did they go now? I don't know. They were two. They put a bag on my head and took me away. So, didn't they torture you? No. No torture. No? Hey, friends... go back! Look here! Oh, great! Give it to me a moment. You're horrible! A disaster! Wait to see me. Wait a minute... How am I? Perfect! Are you ready to go? Yes ...! How are you? Everything is alright. Are you sure? Yes, but I was very scared. Dear. I'm with you. Everything is all right. Girls, stop with your secrets! Come on, let's go. Yes. Stand in line behind me. Let's go... Guys, it's here. What is this place? A Quest. A kind of role-playing game. One goes around and solves situations. And someone else jumps on you to scare you. I saw the advertisement. It's cool! Let's go in... Stop it! Stay still! You broke the balls! Stay still. Someone is coming. Huh... what a chick! Hi, guys. Hi... Are you here for the Quest? We are late? Don't worry. They have just begun. Thank god. Take these lamps: you will need them. Yes? One last thing... Everything is free for you. Everithing? Thit's the entrance to the Quest... You're really a dick. What do we do now? What? Let's enter! It could be fun but let's not get in trouble. Zorick, stop breaking: she said it's free. There are no problems. What do we do if we meet the others? What are you worried about? We're not doing anything wrong. But, if you prefer, you can go home to sleep on Halloween's evening. I stay here. Are you kidding? I already have a bunch of adrenaline inside! Shit, Gera, put your knife away. Put the knife away! Let's go. Wait... Boys, we are all united. We try not to lose ourselves again. Is there a door. Do we open it? Yes ..., ok! Let's enter. Oh, cool! What is this place? I have no idea. It seems an old doctor office. The Game Master told us to find clues. Look around... Look there. I found a locked box. What did you say? I found a box with a four numbers combination lock. We need to find four numbers. I found lamps. We need them. Give me one! Are you opening the box? Give me a lamp. I need light. Give me a lamp! Say 'please', asshole. Please, asshole! You are bastards! The monkey gave me a lamp. Stepan... It looks like a medical report. Let's see... Game Master told us about clues. Dimitri Troglienov ..., born on February 1, 1935 in Arkhangelsk... Hospitalized on 23 April 1986, with the number 4931... Оh, fuck! What's up? He was a clown. So what? His stage name was Zot! Seriously? It's like that ..., look! Oh God! This siren is us breaking my eardrums: let's go! Did you open the box? No! We need four digits. Yuri, there were some numbers in the medical report. 1986! Niki, try with 1986. It works? No, it doesn't work. Another number... 1935... Well. I try... So then? No, it doesn't open yet. It takes other numbers... Ok... 4931! Try with 4931. It works, it opens! We opened it. We made it! Two radios... I'll take them! There are only two old radios! Chains... Give them to me! Zorick, don't touch me! You scared me, fuck! Did you hear the scream? Sure! We are not deaf. You're screaming like a little girl. This is just a game of fear. In here, everyone screams! Say what you want, but I don't like this place. Because you're really a pussy! The boss has explained to you that it's just a game. But if it was not, I always have my knife ready. Gera put your knife away! Wait... Or I'll stick it in your ass! I don't want problems... Let's go. Enter here ..., soon! Where is Peter? Oh, fuck. That's Peter! Peter! Hey, Game Master... Let Peter go immediately! This is not good. We just wanted to have fun! I'm sorry. Are not you having enough fun? We have said to stop it! You heard me? I'm sorry for these little problems. But until you will find your friend, my assistants will take care of him. Bastard! What do we do now? We must find him quickly! Let's go. Peter! How are you? Hurry. Release me! Let's free him and then let's find that fucking bastard! Let's assess the situation... Do you agree to stop this fucking game right away? Yes, yes... we agree! Where is the camera? Game Master... Do you hear us? The game is over! We want to stop it immediately. Game Master, can you hear us? We want to get out of this fucking place right away! No one answers! What are we doing now? We have to find the exit by ourselves. Let's go back into the corridor. Soon... let's go! Stepan, let's stop. We are making the situation worse. Do you have any better ideas? No, but we should... So? What's the point? Let's go. Let's go. Can you do it? Yes. Can you do it? Yes. What a disgusting place! What a smell! What a lousy place! I hope you are not too angry with me. I just tried to amuse you a little. We will have fun when we are out of this place! As you want. But first I would like you to listen to a story. A story? Ok! Tell us a story. Then I will let you go. This is Joanna. A small, sad girl. The doll in her arms is Valentin, her son. And this is... This is Zot, clown of a circus, and Joanna's husband. Zot loved Joanna so much... that he could not live a day without her. How could he stay with her forever? How could he defeat death... and live with her forever? There was only one chance. He had to be able to transform two bodies into one. So Zot... killed and ate his wife. It was a necessary part of their transformation. A blood ritual. But Zot was arrested and locked up in an asylum, because of the psychiatrist who made his report. The psychiatrist's judgment made Zot doubt. It confused his mind. It lacerated his soul. And Valentin, his son, was placed in an orphanage. Poor Zot! He hanged himself! End of the story. What does this mean? I understood! He's showing us the story of Dimitri Troglienov... The crazy psychopath who killed his wife and then committed suicide Remembers the dossier we found in the doctor's office? Yes... No! No! This is not Dimitri Troglienov, nor even Zot. This is just a clown. Dimitri Troglienov really hanged himself in an asylum. And Valentin was really abandoned in an orphanage. Why are you telling us this story? Why? Because the time has arrived for Valentin to avenge his father. Why do you tell? We understood! But why do you tell all this to us? Why to us? Why? Because now you will understand. You will understand everything! Now you will be forced to understand! Run away! This way! Soon! Where's Yuri? The doors are all closed. What are we doing now? Wait. Do you have one of the radios we took in the studio? Yes. Try to call Lena. Ok. Lena, can you hear me? Lena... Lena... Lena ...! Peter, let's go. Fuck! Where's Peter? He stayed behind. Oh, heaven. Open the door! Open the door! Open! Open the door! Bastard! Are you crazy? What do we do now? I'm too scared. Fuck! Don't open. Bastards! Give it to me. Guys, are you there? Yes, Stepan. Here we are. We lost Peter! We try to get out of here. We have lost Yuri instead. We are locked in the computer room. We try to get out of this situation. Ok, let's try. Good luck, guys! Out. Out. So, we must try to calm down and move on. Have you heard? They lost Yuri. We will never get out of here! Be calm. We'll make it. Everything will be fine. We will leave. Those monsters... Those monsters will kill us all one by one! Daniil, I told you to calm down! Master... I did everything you ordered. Now I hope to be admitted to the secret teachings. Of course, Yuri... I always keep my promises. You will be rewarded... For your betrayal! No! Noooo! It's strange. I feel some interference connected to this doll. There's no time. Our guests are waiting for us. Nobody has to survive. Go! The game becomes more interesting. Crap. What is it? Garbage! I told you: I don't like this place. Let's go away! Come on ..., coward. Zorick, what's wrong with you? See what's here! Тr... Тr... Troglianov... that bullshit! Hey, there's a ride! Here we go! I don't come in there! So, stay there, coward! Wait us here! Let's move from here. Guys hurry up... Where are you guys? Fuck! Three new victims have just entered. Who are they? Only boys. It will be easy to kill them. I think so. You'll meet them soon, as soon as they arrive here. Don't worry, Zelda. Nobody will come out of here alive. Better this way. The Master is nervous. We'll think about it. Perfect. Finally we have fun, brother! Come on. Here we go. Daniil, don't worry. We will find the others. Run away! Run away! There's something bad in the air. I don't know... It's worse than being locked inside Butovo's slaughterhouse. How are you? Are you ok? Yes, I'm ok. But it's better that we move. Where we are? Who knows it? I wonder how Zorick is there alone... He is at the beginning of the path: nothing should happen there. He is right. We have to think about us. Ok. Who are these? I saw her. She was that girl who was at the entrance. What are they doing here? I have no idea. Hey you, answer! They seems dead. What happened here? What the fuck I know about this! We have to leave. Immediately. Be careful! Only a moment more and I would have died. Take this kick, asshole! And this too! Gera! Kill this witch! Let him go! Gera! Zhorik! Zhorik! What happens here? Stay back! Don't approach! Where are you going? Didn't you understand that death is everywhere in here? Shit! The rat is trapped! Brother ..., now it's all yours! And this ..., this is mine! What's going on here? I don't know ...! Who are you? It doesn't matter who I am. I lost my friends in this shitty place full of fucking, crazy psychopaths! We will never get out of here. They will kill us all! Talk for yourself. I don't want to die in here! Please help me. Please, take me with you! All right, but everyone has to take care of himself. Please. Stop whining! All right... Stop it, I said! There is something here. There, on the floor. There's something. A lamp. A door... try to open it. It's closed. This way! Hi! It's me. What happen? Roxana... Roxana... It's incredible! Olga's mother called me to warn that Olga was attacked. She didn't deliver the voodoo doll. Is absurd! Andrej! I can not believe it. I know, but it happened! Why do you care so much about a doll? We'll bring something else to Stepan. The important thing is that Olga is fine. Would you like to go home? I accompany you. No... No... Please, call Stepan. Okay. I do it right away. It rings, but no one answers. Strange, usually he always answers. I try to send a message. I'm very worried All these strange signs we have around... The lost voodoo doll, the opposite cards, Olga attacked, Stepan who doesn't answer... If you want, let's see where it is, but I assure you that he will laugh when he sees us so worried. The address? Yes, let's go, please... Zavodskoy tupik, 13. I know the street. Let's go! Thank God: the exit! Hey... Lena! Lena! Are you there? I'm here, but the others are dead! We met some crazy cannibals! They dismembered Daniil front of me! It was something horrible. I found the exit! She found the exit! Оh, thank goodness! I can't open it! Wait... No... pity, noooooo! Lena... Lena... What's going on? Lena! She doesn't answer anymore! They will kill us! They will kill us all! No, please, don't! Don't do it. Let me go! Please... No! Please, nooooo... Don't do it! No, please! No! Please! No! Nooooo! What Stepan came to do in a place like this? There is a corridor. So? We go in there? How can we find him if we stay here? Let's go! Аndrej! Andrej... Wait! I have bad news for you. All your friends are dead. Оh, nooooo! Bastard! Bastard! Now the clown will come to you. But he will not kill you immediately. Our plans have changed a bit. We have other guests. We will have fun together. Nooooo! Handcuffs... Stepan ...! Stepan... Calm... Stay calm! Stepan... Wait... Stepan... What's that? A medical file of such a Dimitri Troglienov. Andrej... There is a passage here. Don't go on! Maybe Stepan went that way... Don't go on alone! Wait... I know that doll! Wait! Wait! Аndrej, stop! What happens? Where is Svetlana? She was behind you. She got lost. I'm going to take a look. Listen. Wait me here. I go back to look for her. Take this. You never know... Please, wait for me here. Don t go anywhere. Ok. Don't move from here. Ok. Svetlana! Svetlana! Svetlana! Damn... Svetlana! Roxana... Roxana! Roxana! "Rahab, Ghenam ..." Is it Latin? "Rahab, Ghenam ..." "Semper stat ..." "Nubilata lux ..." It is not dangerous? The doll doesn't work until a real blood sacrifice is made. Roxana... Roxana ...! Daddy! Stop! Roxana... Welcome, mister Volodin... I was waiting for you! I'm Valentin Troglienov. Is it a name that reminds you of something? Why? Should this remind me of something? It should remind you a lot. But I'll help you. Twenty-five years ago you worked at the court as an expert. I can not figure out where you want to get. The name of one of the convicted in a trial you followed was Dimitri Troglienov. My father. He was a clown. His stage name was Zot! That man was your father? You are right. I did psychiatric expertise at his trial. He was a guy who had crazy ideas about spiritism. He was smart... But... But... he killed his wife and ate her body. That's enough! You were eleven at the time. You should remember everything... Shut up! Enough! He killed your mother and devoured her! I don't want to hear your details! He was a killer! A totally crazy criminal! No! Nobody has ever understood him! Nobody, apart from me. He loved me. He was my father. He was the only ray of light in my life. I lost him because of you. But now... "Rahab!" "Ghenam ..." "Semper stat ..." "Nubilata lux ..." "Uetag ..." "Bipahiè... El Mauta ..." "Ut ..." "Damnatione ..." "Cum magna ..." "Haraab ...!" I curse you... evil people! And I condemn you to... eternal damnation! It didn't have to end this way. Things never go the way we want to. Roxana ...! Roxana! Thank goodness you are alive! How are you? Well. Help Niki... Hurry. Let's get out of here. Let's get away from this dark place. Let's leave! Let's go out to the light.
