[Man] Clear out! Go on, get out of here! [alarm wailing] [Man] Is it happening? [Man screams] [screams] [Girl chuckling] [kissing] [Boy chuckling] [Girl] Oh, is that what you call it? [chuckles] [chuckles] Ooh, that's nice. [chuckles] Getting hot in here? Are we gonna play the Viking game? Mm. [chuckling] Mm! Whoa. [both chuckle] Mm. Mm. [thud] Aah! What the hell is that? Oh, shit! Be careful. [tires squeal] [Man] We don't have all day, gentlemen. Let's move it. [Second man] Come on, let's go. Come on. [First man] Parker, Jones. It's okay. It's okay. [gasps] [Man] I've got people over there. Unload that truck, please. [Woman] You still have that watch, Captain? Never worked worth a damn. Lieutenant Burgess reporting for duty, sir. And what time is it, Lieutenant? It's 0221 hours, sir. Throw that thing away, sir. Good to see you, Toni. You know what this is all about, Nick? No. Let's take a walk, Lieutenant. [distant helicopter] [Man] Set up here. Let's go! Mr. Cutter? Captain. My second-in-command, Lieutenant Burgess. Lieutenant. Cutter. [Nick] What's the situation? Aquarius is down. We have six astronauts in the water. I didn't know there was a mission. Shay, Powell, Rice, Zimmerman, Jackson, and, uh, Saxon... your wife. Debbie? I'm sorry, Nick. My ex-wife. [Cutter] They defied orders, broke a total quarantine. You know 'em all. Saxon, as my special forces commander, I want you to oversee the recovery operations. Captain, Sir. [Nick] Lieutenant, report. Two miles of shoreline secure. Ops says the tide and current should land them about a half mile north. Extend the perimeter one square mile, Lieutenant. Nobody gets in, nobody gets out. I want a mobilized reserve brigade standing by at the ready. Dismissed. Yes, sir. What was the reason for quarantine? See that you get 'em all. That doesn't answer the question. [Nick] Lieutenant, secure the south quadrant. Move. Sir. Why are our feet wet, Mr. Cutter? The whole crew's infected. I don't know how, but you got to get 'em and get 'em all immediately, or they don't stand a chance. Nick, what the hell is going on here? We have an emergency situation, Marian. Aquarius is down in the water, and there's a good chance of contamination. You get your people ready. [Man] Come on, take it down. [Woman] Move it! Move it! [rumbling] What the-- Look out! [groans] What the-- [rapid beeping] Unh! [shifts gears] [tires squealing] [Man] Come back. Halt or I'll shoot! [alarm blaring] [Nick] Sergeant, let me have that weapon. [Nick] Sergeant, check the rear. [Man] It's clear. What do you mean, it's clear? No one's there, sir. How the hell did they get out? Captain, there's no sign of the astronauts. Air support in one minute, Lieutenant. Captain, they can't land here. They won't have to. [rapid beeping] Have you located the canister? No. I have no signal yet. The long-range transmitter must not have survived re-entry. We'll find it. Drop me a line. Let's go. Take me up. [car horn blares] [Man] Say, what do you got-- [tires squeal, horn blares] [Woman] Get out of the way, you morons! [honks horn] [tires squealing] [siren wailing] Hey, you can't-- [Man] Everyone, stay in your vehicle. I'm NASA. I don't care who you are, buddy. Hit the ground! Put down your weapon. I said, hit the ground now! [groaning] [engine revs, tires squeal] [horn honking] [tires squealing] [Nick grunts] Joe? Joe? What the hell happened to you, Joe? Your friend Joe has evolved. [grunts] No! [tires squeal] Okay, I'm gonna get around the right side of the vehicle. You take the left. Roger that. [Nick groaning] Joe! [gurgling] Joe, for God's sake, I'm your best friend. It doesn't matter. [grunts] None of your pathetic little lives matter anymore. [tires squeal] Joe, let me up. No! Ow! [growls] Aah! Aah! Aah! [grunts] [grunting] [grunts] [distant siren] [muttering] [screams] [helicopter rotors] [beeping rapidly] Damn. [birds chirping] [Man] It really screwed us up the last time. [Burgess] It just pisses me off, Nick. I was left in the dark. I didn't even know we had a mission in the air. [Nick] It's the mushroom theory of management. Keep the boys in the dark and feed them shit once in a while. You know that. I don't know anything. What do you know? Captain Saxon. Sergeant. Fox, what are you doing here? Cutter brought me in. You see? Fox is my operations officer. I'm supposed to be notified if anyone redirects him from the duties I've assigned him. I'm being sidestepped so many times, I feel like a turnstile. That's normal. Everything will be explained. To you, maybe, but not to me. You were an astronaut, the first Aquarius mission commander. You're on the inside, not me. Good to see you, Sergeant. Good to be here, I think. [beeping] [Nick] Mr. Cutter. Good morning. [Burgess] I'd like an all-inclusive briefing, sir. Of course, Lieutenant Burgess. My aide North, Sergeant Fox, Captain Saxon. Follow me, please. What you're about to see is the last transmission we received from Aquarius VII before they aborted their mission and returned to Earth. [Nick] Anything new? Nothing new yet. Sergeant North, turn on that playback machine. [beep] [alarm wails] [Man] Something's breached the hull! You set us up. God damn you! God damn, you were in on this. You get us down from here. Get us down from here! Help us! [Burgess] My God! What happened up there? We're not sure. I never heard Joe Shay swear in my entire life. Aquarius VII was a top-secret Omega space mission. As such, we can't go to other government or civilian agencies for help. You understand. I understand something went terribly wrong up there, Sergeant. We don't know how it happened. The astronauts destroyed the onboard computer and all their data-transmission units. We fear Aquarius VII was exposed to some unknown space virus. Captain Saxon, you've worked with Lieutenant Burgess and Sergeant Fox previously. Yes, sir, I have many times, Mr. Cutter, and they're very qualified. They're both combat-decorated, and they're the best urban search-and-locate team we have. Good. The successful completion of this mission subordinates all other directives. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Very good. Captain, can we have a word in private? [Cutter] Commander Shay's one of your best friends, is he not? Yes, sir, he is. The fact that your former wife is one of the missing crew members a problem? No, sir. Nick, we have reason to believe that this is related to what happened to you and your crew on Aquarius II. Now, it may be just in the initial infestation, but if you can't bring 'em in... I'll have no other choice but to terminate the entire crew. [Nick] Murphy. Murph! [alarm blaring] Sergeant, fall back. Get your men to fall back! [Woman] Would Lieutenant Colonel Donald Bowman please report to the security office in Sector B. Lieutenant Colonel Donald Bowman, the security office in Sector B. [beeping] Doctor, did you want to look at this? Oh, yeah, call me if the temp goes any higher. [Woman] ...I need that now. [Second woman] Dr. Fico on line five. Dr. Kline, if you'll take a look at this you'll see I... Good afternoon, ma'am. [Woman] Dr. John Winn, please report to the optical unit. [machine beeping] Any change, Ferris? No, he hasn't come out of the sedative yet, but his vital signs are normal. Well, it would help if I knew what I was looking for. Keep me posted. I need a break. [beeping quickens, steadies] [machine whirring] [gurgling] [constant beep] Oh, my God, he's convulsing! Give me a hand here. Oh, my God. Help me over here. Oh, wait. Oh. Oh! Help! I need help! Aah! [constant beep] Whoa, shit! Guards! Guards! Aah! [grunting] [people shrieking] [Woman] Security alert, next level. Code eight. Personnel respond. Side entrance clear. Secure B Sector. Did they come through here? Which way did they go? Down there. [grunting] Get out of the way! Kill him! Come on! [groan] Don't shoot. Don't shoot! I want him alive! Oh! Aah! [groans] Nick, are you all right? [Man] Get down! [gulls screeching] [Man coughing] Powell. Powell! It's you. Yeah. Jackson? Jackson. Zimmerman. Maybe they're asleep. No, they're not asleep. They're awake. They're resting. What the hell are we gonna do? They can control us at will. They're parasites. We're the hosts. They're gonna kill us when they're finished with us. I guarantee it. What are our options? There's zero options. We destroy ourselves. This may be our only chance. I have a wife and kids. I have a wife, and I have a kid. This may be your only chance to save them. It may be your only chance to save the human race. You are privy to these creatures' thoughts. We all are. We know what they plan. It's the only way. [groaning] Vulee. Rook. Vanitok. This structure is suitable. We'll locate ourselves here. We must find the canister immediately. [beeping] The canister's short-range transmitter's working, but it's offline. You've located a signal? Yes, but I can't lock on. That means I know the general location but I can't pin it down. We'll search the landing area in teams. [beeping continues] [Burgess] Debbie's a very capable woman, Nick. I'm sure she's okay. She can take care of herself. [Nick] Oh, yeah, she sure ate me alive. [Burgess] No, you ate each other alive. The cure for that problem is never get married. Amen. So, you ready to tell me what's really going on with this operation? You were at the briefing, Lieutenant. Oh, give me some credit, Nick. I know when I'm being fed bullshit, and right now I feel stuffed. [chuckles] [Fox] Nicholas T. Saxon, born January 5 in the year 1952. What are you doing? Perusing our brilliant captain's personnel file. [chuckles] Do you mind, Nick? Nah. Nicholas T. Saxon fought in Vietnam, special forces. A class-one sniper. Ooh! Beaucoup decorations. Purple heart, bronze star. C.M.H. Congressional Medal of Honor. Very impressive. And here I shared all my war stories with you. How come you never shared yours with me? Okay, Lieutenant, you take me out one night, get me drunk. I'll tell you about all my buddies killed in combat, hmm? [Fox] After the war, the young Lieutenant joined the Air Force and their top-secret Omega space program. [Man] Help me! [Woman] No! [Nick] Murphy! Murph. [alarm blaring] Murphy! [Fox] Oh, this is interesting. A whole 18 months... [Nick] Where's Thompson? I'll go get him. [Second man] Help me! [alarm blaring] [gasps] Hey, you guys help out a Vietnam vet? Nick, don't do that. Nick! What outfit were you with? Third recon. I was a marine. Bless you. Hey, soldier. Semper Fi. Third recon. God bless you, buddy. [foghorn blaring] [Man] Hey, man, look at this bum over here. Let me have some fun with him, all right? Watch this. Watch this, I'm gonna scare him. Watch. Hey! [gasps] You boys is welcome to share. I sure hope you leave some. You ain't got much left. I'm awful sorry. If-- If I'd knowed you's coming... [laughs] Ooh! [groaning] Get up. Get up. Get up! You got any gold left in there, old man? You got to be kidding. Well, you ain't worth shit. Aah! Aah! [gadget beeping] [Rook] It is close. Old man, do you know this warehouse district well? Like the-- the back of my hand. Ah! Would you like to help us, old man? Would you like to make a little money? [both chuckling] You would. [chuckles] [chuckles] [Nick] This is a waste of time. They're not anywhere near here. [Burgess sighs] I agree. [Fox] Wait, wait, wait! [beeping] Yes! Got it! [Nick] What? The astronauts were all wearing biomedical monitoring systems-- electrodes attached with torso harnesses. Course, they tore 'em off before they landed, but one of them is still wearing a transmitter attached to his jumper suit, and the emergency battery just kicked in. Contact H.Q., get them the coordinates right now. Already done. [beeping] There it is. The transmitter took a hit, but it looks like the canister made it. It's the condition of the eggs that matter. Every egg survived. Look. There's our future. There's our army. What is it? [truck approaching] [Man] Move it back up. Go, go, go. Rook, Vulee, get the canister back to the nest. Take him! Alpha Six reporting, all quiet in here so far. Over. [Man] Circle around the building. [Second man] Move it, move it! Hey! [cocks gun] Watch the rear doors. [Fox] These are the coordinates. This is the building. Your man should be right inside. [gadget beeping] They're close. Right. Watch for Cutter's crew. They have the same coordinates we do. I'm gonna stay here, watch the back door. You locate Cutter's squad, you report back to me. You got it, Nick. Let's go. [Joe] I don't want to kill you, Nick. Joe... I know what you are. Joe, I can help you. No! No, you cannot help me. No one can help me. The next time it will kill you! [distant gunfire] [Man] We got 'em over here. Over that way! [Second man] Watch there. Watch the rear. [groaning] [Old man muttering] [Man] Let's load up. [Second man] Get that truck on in. Guys, move, move. Close it down. Close it down. [Cutter] Dr. Kline, I want this man quarantined and made ready for an immediate localized autopsy upon arrival at H.Q. Now sedate him. That should be enough. Give him more. It'll probably kill him. I'm not interested in him. Get him into quarantine and perform the autopsy as soon as possible. I want that specimen now. What specimen, sir? Looks like the other ones got away, and we have casualties. We have what we need. We have one alive. [chuckles] I want the others found and terminated, Mr. North. Terminated with extreme prejudice. Move. [Man] Listen up. Turn it off. [Second man] Move it, fellas, move it. Go. [Third man] It's time to go home. I don't want to be here all night. [Woman] Move away from the van! [Second woman] Take cover! [First woman] Nicholas, tomorrow, second honeymoon. [Cutter] Get extinguishers in here, and get the specimen out of that van now! [Man] Sir, yes, sir! Let's get those extinguishers in here. [Second man] Help him with the body. [Cutter] Kline. Oh, my God. Let's cut him open. Cut him open! Yes, sir. North! I want this entire warehouse district evacuated and quarantined by dawn, and I don't care how you do it. Okay, disperse, people. Let's pack up and get the hell out of here. [heavy breathing] [saw blade whirring] [heart beating] [gurgling] [screeching] Oh! Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! I did not sign up for this. Collect the remains, Doctor. I want an extensive autopsy. No. I refuse. What you're doing here defies all legal and ethical precedence, and I intend to report this-- Sergeant Lasher! Sir. Arrest Dr. Kline on direct insubordination. Yes, sir. Take her to H.Q., holding cell. You son of a bitch! [Lasher] Shut up. Cutter, what's going on here? You can return to your post, Captain. Sir? Is there a problem, Mr. Saxon? Be careful, Captain. Be very careful. Nick, let's go. [Joe] Enough. [groans] That was not necessary, Katar. Careful, Rook. The humans are strong. They'll take control if you give them a chance. And then I would be forced to destroy you. [grunts] Miss Kline, are you still loyal to the Omega organization? If you are not-- May I leave now? [sighs] Lasher. You know, the old ways are still the best. Smartass bitch, aren't you. Aren't you gonna ask me any more questions? Unh! [typing] Damn. Let me try this. Yeah. Come on, baby. It's encrypted. "Capture specimen for defense of Omega. All original mission parameters eliminated." You bastards. You wanted them to come here. [alarm blaring] Sergeant, check it out. Yes, sir. [alarm blaring] [both grunting] I'll check on Lasher. You son of a bitch! You called them back, and they got away from you. How stupid could you be? It was a perfectly planned operation. It was the execution which was flawed. Yes, we called 'em back with a recorded signal we retrieved from the ruins of your failed mission on Aquarius II. The astronauts didn't know it. They were the bait. We knew the aliens would infest them, but this time we'd be ready. We'd send an assault team to the station before the aliens matured. At that point we could have contained them. Had the astronauts not panicked, had they obeyed orders and maintained their orbit, the operation would have worked perfectly, but they didn't. [scoffs] They aborted. They came back to Earth, and now, well... here we are. You're sick. Nick, stop. Don't! You'll never get away with this, Saxon. You're a dead man, and your wife's dead too. Get out. North. Let 'em go.

Please, God, don't test my strength again. ♪ You're the one... ♪ [car horn blares] [Man] No, she's not! What are you calling me, an old man? [Woman] You know, you're probably old enough... Your head okay? [Marian] A few bruised brain cells, but no biggie. You were lucky. Lucky you came along. Hope you like Chinese. Nick. Mm-hmm? Thanks for saving my life. How many times did you make sure my decontamination was perfect when I came back from space? [chuckling] Oh, this was a bit different. We've got to find those astronauts. I know why Omega wants one of these organisms. My God, full-grown? They'd be incredible killing machines. Yeah, you're right, and after they've captured one of them and they're done with that-- Huh. They're gonna kill us all. [Marian] Nick, what are we doing in a place like this anyway? I'm, like, afraid to touch anything. Debbie and I spent our second anniversary here. You're kidding. In this room. Oh, is that why Deborah said that business about a second honeymoon at the warehouse? She's gonna meet us here? Nobody else knew we stayed here but us. So we wait. We wait. Let's get some sleep. [distant siren] [groans] [sighs] [gulls screeching] [indistinct police radio] [Woman] 1380, 61. 1380, 61... [static] Still inside. [truck horn blares] [Marian groans] [Woman] Units 27... All right, the cat's out of the bag. [Woman] ...one, one, David, one, zero, nine, nine, nine, six... Thank you. Don't move! [grunts] Reach for your gun and I'll rip you. Got it. I know you have a backup strapped to your ankle. Don't reach for it. How do you know that? Your wife knows. Okay, can I take your order? Damn! That's a hell of a hangover, honey. What were you drinking last night? Okay. What can I get you? Pizza with the works. We don't serve pizza in the morning, honey. This is a 24-hour menu. We don't have pizza. Okay, dear? I'm sure you have a frozen pizza in the back. I'll wait while you cook it. No pizza in the morning. But you do have pizza. Just not any for me? I'll come back when you're ready to order. Okay, wait. I'll have a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato. Hold the fries. Okay. Then I'll have a Spanish omelet with olives, mushrooms, green peppers, onions. Hold the fries. Hold the hash browns. Hold the eggs. No eggs. No eggs, dear. Then give me a side of sausage cut into little pieces. And I'll have tomato juice with that. That'll be really good for that nasty hangover. Can I get anything for you, sir? Huh? Anything at all for you, sir? No. [Waitress] Okay. What did you do with Debbie? She's here and unharmed. My name is Sybedra. I come from a world unknown to you. I'm a watcher. I've come to destroy the Dark Breed. Who are the Dark Breed? You know who they are and what they are. The Dark Breed are the ones that destroyed your squad on the space station. Now they've infested your astronauts. Why? They're using their bodies as hosts. Once they mature, they'll invade your population and destroy your world. What about Debbie? I have inhabited her body to follow the Dark Breed. If we destroy the Dark Breed in time, I'll be able to leave her body with no harm. How much time? 39 hours. If we kill 'em in time, I'll be able to leave her body. The process will kill me, but it will not harm her. And what if the 39 hours pass? Then I will mature, and the process will kill Deborah. But you have to understand, the future of your entire race is at stake. I cannot depart Deborah's body until the Dark Breed are dead. That's why I came to you. I need your help. You need my help? Then I wanna talk to Debbie first. [Lasher] Welcome back. We're on. We take 'em out at 0800. Take them out? You don't mean-- I mean terminate, execute. Do you understand that, Lieutenant? Captain Saxon is a commander in the United States military. Captain Saxon and Dr. Kline have committed treason. I will afford them no opportunity to resist my enforcement of the law. Your responsibility is to secure the rear of the building. Sir. Shoot 'em on sight, and shoot to kill. I may be way out of line, but something's really wrong here. We have our orders. How's the view? No change. Hi, Nick. Debbie? It's been a while. You okay? Yeah, I think so. Can you-- Can you fight this thing? I tried at first, Nick, but it was too much of a battle. When I learned what she was and what she was here for, well, I thought I should help her out. Are you in any pain? No... but I'm definitely not in control. Huh! Oh, I know how that must just piss you off. God! Nothing changes. I can't believe this. I'm the one inhabited by an alien, and you're still giving me shit. Oh, come on, Debbie, it's just a joke. [scoffs] You still have the watch. Yeah. It's all scraped up, Nick. You know, my grandfather carried this-- Through the trenches of World War I. Without even getting a scratch. You've had it three years, and it's probably ruined. It never worked right in the first place. So it is broken. [sighs] Unbelievable. [Sybedra] She's getting emotional, Nick. Humans are hard to control when they get emotional. They sure are. There's someone coming in the back. Some welcome. What the hell are you doing here? I followed you. You followed us? Who else knows we're here? Everybody on the Omega payroll. You're surrounded, Nick. What's the situation? Fox is bringing the van around back. Let's go. Everybody down! Nick, Burgess is hit. Toni. Toni! Nick. We're gonna get you out of here. Go. Leave me. I'm not leaving you here. [Marian] Nick, please, we have to leave her. I'm sorry. [horn honks] [Sybedra] Let's go. Let's go! [horn honks] Come on, man, let's go! Let's go! Come on, let's go! Hey, where's Burgess? Where's Burgess? She's dead. Go. Oh, shit. [gunfire] Hang on! Come on! Jesus! Cut the cable! [horn blares] [Nick] Hold on. [Debbie] Hold on, Nick. [horn blares] Straighten it up. Nick, hold on. Give me your hand! Oh! [car horn blares] Shit! Nick! Nick! Give me your hand! Slow down! Can't! Debbie! Yeah! Pull me in! Come on! Come on! Your hand! [grunts] Go! Oh, my God! [tires screeching] [beeping] [Nick] We're in an Omega safe house. We should be okay here for a couple of hours, max. They've got these sites all over the city. It's a clandestine operation, Doc. Omega likes to sneak around. You can override the security system here? Hey, no problem. We're not talking brain surgery. Show-off. Let's go, Fox. Hustle up. [Man] Security system offline. We're clear. [typing] [Sybedra] Okay, we have to be exact. Exactly five seconds between the end of the start sequence and the activation button, or the sequence will not be initiated. [Nick] Got it. Five seconds. Thank you. This is a series of buttons that must be pressed in this order in order to initiate the egg canister's self-destruct sequence. Okay, I'll practice. There's only one problem. There always was. [Debbie] You really think that I was the one that made our marriage fall apart, don't you. Please, don't start. It's two to tango and two to destroy a marriage, Nick. Look, I don't think this is the time or the place-- [Sybedra] At least I was the one that acknowledged we had problems. Who am I arguing with, Deborah or Sybedra? Both of us. Both of you. I'm speaking for Deborah, and I gotta say, from her point of view you were a-- Jackass, I know. Yeah. You're female, right? I don't mean to take sides. No, you got to be a female. You see, you take two females, put 'em together, I'm bound to lose. I don't want to argue... especially with an alien. Can we get back to business? Wanna tell me what the problem with the sequence was? Though the series of buttons are entered and initialized, you still have to press the red commencement switch or the green abort switch. Damn. Those Omega bastards are really burning up the airwaves. Captain Saxon! You are now a wanted man on every list in the continental U.S.A. Federal, state police, F.B.I., C.I.A., Interpol. Jesus, I'm on it too. We stick our faces out there anywhere, and they'll blow 'em right off. We're gonna need some help. [typing] Fox. Almost there, almost there. Got it! You're in. Nice job. [laughs] They're in the Corbett Street armory-- the old church. Yeah. Fox isn't the genius he thinks he is. There's no way he could have known about that infrared system. Well, let's go get 'em. Fox. I'm on it. Take a look inside. Pick your weapon. Check it out. Dr. Kline might need one. Show her how to use it. Can I talk to you for a minute? Do you know what this is? Where did you get that? [Fox] Here you go. Look. Just point it, squeeze this. [Fox] You're doing just fine, Doc. Just hang in there. We'll get through this pretty soon. Four years ago, May 17th, 0900 hours, I led a squad of special forces aboard the top-secret Aquarius II space station. Nobody knew it existed except the top men. Nobody. My orders were to locate the crew, return. There was no crew. And then it attacked. We threw everything we had at it, but we couldn't stop it. We ran out of ammunition. The only sound you could hear were the pins dry-firing. We went to bayonets fixed. I ordered my men stand fast, hold your ground. They were wiped out. Slaughtered. I managed to make my way back to the shuttle. Fired off a cluster round. There was nothing left...but this. And me. This is a glutock. It was developed by the Dark Breed. They're never to be taken alive. This is a suicide device. Whenever the blades are exposed, it sinks into the flesh, it detonates. All-- All I want to know is will it kill the Dark Breed? It'll kill anything. [tires squeal] It's time for us to go. [Woman] You are clear. Gate 14 clear. Fox, get us out of here. Yeah, yeah, this way. [Fox] Come on. This way. Let's go! Let's go!

[Jennifer] ...tell me anything! And I've been asking around, and nobody will let me know! [Powell] Jennifer, I've been-- It's him. Did you trace the source? [beeping] 2,000 yards due east of our position. Good. Collect the search teams now. Oh, I love you, Jennifer. I'll always love you. You know I'll always-- You fool. I'll fight you. I'll fight you to the death! You will not endure, human. [Fox] I've intercepted an Omega transmission, and they're sending an awful lot of hardware to an address in San Pedro. Should we check it out? [Nick] Definitely, Sergeant. Good work. Let's go to work and find that nest. Omega's probably right on our heels. [Debbie] I'm also beginning to pick up a signal. [Nick] Let's go. [beeping] Fox. All clear. I've got 'em at less than 3.5 miles away. In front, to our flank. I'll take the point, Fox. You check the rear. Debbie, give me a five count and follow. [gadgets beeping] [Marian] Sybedra, where in hell did the Dark Breed come from? My race were once parasites, without conscience infesting the galaxy, moving from host world to host world. We were a cruel and murderous race in the old days. No offense, but it seems like you're reliving the old days. We changed. We evolved. We became a race of builders, a race dedicated to peace, a society with our faces to the sun. [beeping] [Man] Let's go. Come on, come on! Move back! How long do they require the host body? It takes 84 hours for their bodies to reach maturity and for them to adjust to the new environment. Well, can I assume that the Dark Breed require the body for the entire incubation period? Yes. If they leave the body prematurely, it means near-instant death. Well, that's our chance! We've got to get to them before they mature. First we have to find the egg canister. We have five hours 'til the eggs burst. Burst? [beeping] What does that mean? I've located the egg canister. Oh, my God. [Fox] Captain, we're clear in the back, but I'm getting strong readings down this corridor. Debbie, you head for the nest. Fox, you go with her. We'll create a diversion in the corridor. Fox, you're gonna get to that nest before I will. This is a glutock. It'll destroy the Dark Breed. All you have to do-- I know how it works. I heard her talk to you. [Fox] Kline, take this. Let's go. Let's move out, Doctor. [distant shouting] Move on out. Back it up. [alien groaning] [groaning continues] [Lasher] Split up. You, come with me. [distant shouting] [Man] Flank two formation. Go. It's clear. [Man] Hey! [beeping] I love Plan B. [Man] Fall back, fall back! [Second man] Boys, if you want to make it, you got to throw a bomb. [Third man] You cover the left side. [beeping] [Man] Come on, let's go. [screaming] [beeping] Aah! [Cutter] No, don't hurt her. I need her alive! Let's get her out of here. And tell your people not to forget that canister.
