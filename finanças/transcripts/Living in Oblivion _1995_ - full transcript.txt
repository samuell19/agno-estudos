[radio transmission] Camera truck's comin' in. We're about two blocks away. Where do we park? Excuse me, where do we park? Anybody know where the camera truck can park? No. - What time is it? - 4:00. Why? This milk's bad. - When did you buy it? - Tuesday. - I don't know. What's today? - Monday. [radiO] COPY- There's a deli on Broadway. - Anything closer? - Nothing that's open. [radio] Where are we supposed to park? Is it that bad? I don't know. You're the one who said it was bad. [radio] Excuse me, where are we supposed to park? [radio] Does anyone know where the camera truck parks? [radio] Listen, camera truck, I want... [radio] Camera truck? [radio] Camera truck? Did you hear that? This is the worse fuckin' cup of coffee I've had in my life. - Then don't drink it. - What are we doing today? "Interior. Living room. Ellen talks to Mom. " Any nudity? Yeah, you have to take your fuckin' pants off. - I'll do it. I like Ellen. - Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie. - I worked on that film. - The shower scene. Start with the 5k through the window... and run stingers for three blondes into the living room. So, two people. Sitting? Standing? What? Who fuckin' knows? "Ellen talks to Mom. " Tired? Uh, no. I've been up since 4:00. I got a big scene today. I'm kind of nervous about it. - “Ellen talks to Mom"? - Oh, have you read the script? Uh, no, it's on the call sheet. Oh. Yeah, well, it's pretty emotional. I tell my mother that I never felt she really, um, loved me. You're gonna yell at each other? Oh, I don't know. I'm just gonna go with how I feel, which is the scary part. I'm pretty close to this character. Problems with your own mom? Yeah. But she, uh, died before I... well, before we could reconcile. You were really great in that Richard Gere movie. Thanks. Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. I... Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. Hi, Mom. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Not a wink. Okay, look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda. All I'm saying is that we left last night and I knew we didn't get that scene. I'm sorry, I thought it was a great scene, Nick. It was okay and you know I can use it. It's gonna be all right. But today I'm not gonna settle for okay. This is a big scene, and I'm not leaving 'til we get it. Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here for you. All right, Wolf, here's what I want to do. I want to get the whole scene in one shot. - It's been done. - I know, but let's try it anyway. - Hand-held? - No, dolly. We go from close-up, pull back to a wide shot, back to a close-up. I'll use the 35. It'll minimize the distortion. We can light the whole thing from the ceiling. It actually could be kind of great. It sounds incredible. How long, Wolf? I gotta see a couple run-throughs. Not too many, all right? It's a big scene for the actors. I don't want to wear them out before we get started. We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it takes. How long, Wolf? Forty-five? An hour? I don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick. I gotta dump in the milk. It's the only way I can cut the taste. - Jesus! - Flame on, asshole! All right, kill that one. Okay, picture's up. Quiet! Now hold the work over there. Alright, we're going for picture. Lock it up. Cora, you're doing fine.

Nick, you gotta take a look at this. I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. She's coming right through the lens. That's beautiful, man. That's great. Ready, Nick? - Call it, Wanda. - All right, roll sound. - Speed. - Roll camera. - Rolling. - Scene six, take one. Everybody settle. And... action. Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much, but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. Then he went over and started hitting Danny. Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. You were just standing there looking at me, Mom. Then you... then you pulled me up and said, "you're not hurt." Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again. I was worried about Danny. - You remember. - He was smaller than you. You were so worried about Danny, Mom. What about... (Wolf): Cut. - That's a cut! - Sorry, I had to cut. Les, your boom's all over my frame. Yo, I asked for a frame line. Okay, can we get a frame line, please? - Les, do you have a frame line? - I think so. All right, now lock it up. We're going for picture. That was beautiful, both of you.

No. Um, listen, I was wondering, is there any way to use some of those earlier takes? Not unless I change the shot and do a cutaway of Cora and then find a way to intercut the takes. But I don't want to do that. - No? This is a really nice shot. - What you're doing is incredible. - Really? - Really incredible. - Okay. - All right? - Yeah.

She declares her love, she comes to me, and she steps into this beautiful two-shot... that you and the wolfmeister have set up here. - What do you think, Wolf? - I don't like it. It's Ellen's scene. I don't know...it sort of makes sense. You did it, man. It's in the writing. I'd have to relight. We are ahead of schedule, Nick, if that means anything to you. Let's do it. Get me a tweenie over here, with diffusion. Okay, everyone. Please stand by. We are pausing briefly to set one little light. And then we are going again right away. Stand-in, please, for Mr. Palomino. - Oh, I'll do it. Get the fuckin' light! He's a bit of a prima donna, but Nick is working... That's cool. Okay, Thursday. That's good. I'm going to the ballet next week. - Your hair could use some work, man. - Why don't you finish me on the set? - Sugar? - Just a bit. (Nicole): He doesn't give a shit about me. - You like jazz? - Very much. - We should go hear some tonight. - That'd be nice. [sighins] It's going well, I think. Don't you think? Very well. What time do you think we'll be finished? Early, I HOPE- - I'm going to a jazz club tonight. - Really? So am I. He's wonderful, isn't he? So natural, just like air. Chad? I wonder what his sign is. Do you know, Nicole? No, I don't know his sign, but... I think his moon is in Uranus. - You don't have to be nasty. - Oh, I'm sorry. Yo, Wolf man, is this my new mark? Until you fuckin' change it. Where's my fuckin' eye patch? Hey, Lester! Anybody seen my eye patch? Admired? That sounds rather professional. Hey, Chad. Hey. Hey. I'm Bob. I'm lighting the show. Chad Palomino, actor. - (Wolf):Where's my goddamn eye patch? - Yeah, I know, uh... - Hey, what's your name? - Maurice. - Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any relation? Probably not, huh? - Hey, Chad, I'm... - Smokin' crew, guys. - Thanks. Hey, thanks. I wrote a script, and I thought you might want to take a... Hey, Bill, you see the top of that light there? Uh... yeah. Bring that down about three feet. (WOW): Anybody See“ "W eve pat h c "e? The dailies from last night looked really... You look incredible, Nicole. Hey, do you want to... Nicole, would you care to have a drink with me, you know, tonight? I just wanted to... we could talk about... - Oh...I'm sorry, Nick. - Oh, that's okay, Nicole. I was just splashing a little water on my face. Oh. Uh, listen, I... it's going pretty well, right? Is it? I don't know. Something feels off. - Yeah, you seem a little tense. - Do I? But don't worry about it. Just, uh take the attention off yourself and put it on Chad. Work off him a little more. - Okay, I'll try that. - Good. I know he's no Olivier or anything, but... He's got something though, right? Don't you think he's got like a natural presence? Yeah. He's very natural. Like air. So... is there anything else I could help you with? Uh... actually, there is. Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth? - Sure. - (woman's voice): Nicole? Nicole? (woman's voice): Please get Nicole to wardrobe. [radio] Yeah? My eye's killing me. Put your eye patch on. I lost it. Is that little light set yet? The light was set about ten minutes ago. Uh, get the a-team in here right away: Nick, Nicole and Mr. Palomino. Why didn't you tell me? Hey, you're not worried about the time, I'm not worried about the time. Oh, I am very worried about the time. Oh, I know you are. - What is that supposed to mean? - What do you think it means? - I don't know what it means! - Yes, you do. - No, I don't! - The hell you don't. I haven't clone anything! Wanda, please, you have to understand... Why are you accusing me? You don't understand me! You don't even care! All I do is take care of you constantly! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey! What the fuck, Wanda? Huh? I'm trying to shoot an intimate scene here. I don't need a lot of tension on set, all right? Damian, you on your new mark? Good. All right. Close-up of Damian, Ellen in the back... - Chad, what are you doing? - Hey, that's my fuckin' eye patch! Can I borrow it, Wolf? Nick, it just feels right. I've got this guy now! - No, Chad, it doesn't work. You're wrong, man. I'm gonna fight you on this one. Hey, that's my eye patch, and I don't want anyone else wearing it. It's insanitary! Fine! I'll get my own eye patch! Nick, send someone out, get me an eye patch. I'll pay for it myself. Get an eye patch for Mr. Palomino. Chad, let me talk to you for a second. Look, I didn't want to say this in front of Wolf, but, uh, it makes you look a little... gay. - Really? - A little bit. Jesus. Oh... you're right. - Good call. Thanks, buddy. - Sure. - (Wanda): We're ready, Nick. - Uh, Wolf, you need a rehearsal? Let's just fucking shoot it. El lobo! - Call it, Wanda. - Lock it up. - And roll sound. - Speed. - Roll camera. Rolling. - Scene six, take four. Everybody, keep the energy up. And... action. I've always admired you from afar. Admired? Sounds rather professional. Well, then, loved. How does that sound? Sounds like champagne talking. I've loved you from the moment we met. Why didn't you tell me? We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. God! - Cut. That's a cut. - Sorry, Nick. Sorry. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. Nick, can I talk to you for a second? What? Two seconds, Wanda. Everybody stand by. All right, momentary delay. Everyone stand by. We're gonna go again right away. Uh, excuse me, Ellen. You were a tad low on that. Okay, I'll bring it up. Actually, could I listen to the take before? Sure. Here it is. It's coming up right now. [tape rewinding] I've loved you from the moment we met. Why didn't you tell... Chad, just one second, okay? Talk to me. What's going on? - I cannot act with that woman! - Shh. I know that she's a friend of yours, but she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! Did you see that whole thing I just did with the hair? That was great. I came up with that on my own! I thought it would help her! - Cut. Thanks. - (Chad): She's giving me nothing! - Just a second. - (Chad): I'm outta here! Why the hell did you cast her? She sucked in that Richard Gere movie! - (Nick): You're right. Okay, he's not the best actress in the world. I can see that now. But you've gotta help me out here, Chad. All right? I'm asking you, please. Work with me, all right? (Chad): Let me tell you something, man. Do you know why she took a cab this morning? - (Nick):Something came up. - (Chad):No, she was in my hotel room, and she didn't want you to know about it, okay? Now, I'm sorry it had to come out like this, but I told her this morning, I said, "thanks a lot. "I had a lot of fun last night. "But let's get something straight here, baby. This is a one-time deal. " She didn't want to hear that. She wanted more. You see what I'm saying? It's rejection. Okay. Hey, I'll talk to her, all right? I'm here for you, man. I appreciate that, man, because, you know, you're one of the best actors I've ever worked with. All right? So, let's just... we can do this, all right? Okay, here we go. Director and actor are on set. First positions please. Nicole, listen... Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I-I-I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I just... I'm completely unfocused here. I think what we need to do is to just loosen up the scene somehow. What would you like to do? I was wondering... maybe could we try improvising the scene a little bit? More along the lines of what Chad's been doing. Maybe that will help me find something. That's a fantastic idea. - What do you think, Chad? - That's the only way I can work. Let's take it apart. Let's cut it loose. Good. And, uh, we'll shoot it, all right? Hell, why not? Roll that mother fuckin' camera, Wolfie. - Kiss my ass! - Yeah! All right! Now we're making a fuckin' movie! - Call it, Wanda. - Okay, lock it up. - Going for picture. - Look alive. And roll sound. - Speed. - Roll camera. Rolling! Scene six, take five. Action! I've always admired you from afar. Have you? That's... wow. That's incredible. Admired? Sounds kind of professional though, doesn't it? Admired? You're right. How does, um... despised sound? Great. What does it mean? Well, it's sort of like I think that you are a slimy piece of shit. - That sounds like champagne talking. - Oh, no, no, no, it's not. It's not. I really do think you are a piece of shit. No, you don't. You love me. Oh, no. The fuck I do. I can't stand looking at you. Then I guess I have nothing to say. No, no, no, no. no. I think...you have a lot more to say, Damian. Well, I'm a little surprised that you feel this way, Ellen, because I'd always thought you had admired me. No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I think that you should tell everyone... what you just told Nick behind the set. Hey, wait a second. This isn't part of the scene. (Nicole): No, say it anyway. Say it anyway, Damian. The reason that this scene isn't working... is because you and I slept together last night, right? Did everyone hear that? I fucked Chad last night! See Nick? This is exactly what I was trying to tell you. It's about rejection! Oh, you fucking asshole. You think I give a fuck about you? I was there to get laid. And even that was a joke. (Chad): You're really starting to fuckin' piss me off! Oh, I am? Does that mean you're not gonna wiggle around on the bed anymore... or stroke my hair all soft and concerned... or kiss me like a soap-opera-acting piece of shit? Fuck! - Hey, hey, hey! All right! - Come on! I'll kick the fuckin' shit out of you! - Hey, cut that... cut, cut, cut! - Fucking loser! I think we can hold it right there. Yeah, you bet we can hold it right there! Wanda, call me a cab! - Hold on, Chad. Just try and calm down. Fuck you, man! - Hey, calm down. - Get your fuckin' hands off me! First of all, I'm outta here! This movie's bullshit! Hey, one second there, Chad. No reason for hostility, okay? Why don't you shut up, you fuckin' loser. The only reason I took a part in this movie... is because someone said that you were tight with Quentin Tarantino! - You're nowhere, man! - Do you want to go? Go! All right? I am so sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker. What did you say? - You heard me. - Say it again! You hostess twinkie motherfucker. Ow! [screaming] Goddamn it. Everyone, just stop it! Get off... Nicole, get off! Nicole, get off of him! Come on! Get off of him! Ow! God! Oh! I'm gonna kick your ass, Chad. Wolf! Oh, god! Oh, god. Oh! Oh, god. Wolf. Come here! I'll kick your fuckin' ass! Hey, hey, hey! You wanna pick my brain, huh? This is how I direct twinkie motherfuckers like you! You scumbag! Come on, I'll kick your ass! You wanna pick my brain? - Hold it, tiger! Get off! - Let go! Easy now! Chad. (Nick): Have a nice flight home, buddy! (woman's voice): Fucking killed him! The only reason I cast you is because of your name! Yeah, get him outta here! Take him back to his hotel! (Nicole): Asshole. - Nicole, are you okay? - Don't touch me. Can I help, guys? Oh, shit, my back. I pulled my back, Bob. It's called Tsunami. A Japanese tidal wave hits New York. You're an ex-navy seal frogman. You're working undercover. You save the city. You'd be perfect for the lead. My number's there. You call me, I call you. Either way, it's been great working with you! Nicole...I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. You were great in that Richard Gere movie. Shut up. You are no different than he is. You lie! You're deceitful! I'm not lying! Christ, I tell everybody how great you are. I've got nothing but respect and admiration for you. Christ, Nick, now you're doing your own fucking script. - Why do you think I wrote it? - I have no idea. It's about you. It's how I feel about you. Did you get a bump on your head, Nicky... 'cause you're talking like an idiot! No. Nicole, I've loved you since the clay we met. ♪ [soft music playing] Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want anything to interfere with us working together. Oh, god. And all this time I thought... A' Oh, god. - Don't go out that door! - Why not? Because it's part of the set, goddamn it! Now go around. Next time. This is an emergency! [sighins] Has Ellen arrived yet? - [radio] Check. Well, get her into wardrobe right away! No, scene six. Scene five has been postponed. I'm not gonna tell you again! Mr. Palomino is not working today. - What are you talking about? - Where's my goddamn smoke machine? [farting sound] Oh, god. Oh! What do you want? I gotta use the bathroom, man. It's really an emergency. - Fuckin' knock! You're right. One of these days, I'm going to punch somebody in the balls! Straighten up. You're not gonna believe this, Nicole. Just as we pull up in front of your apartment, Palomino tells me... he is suddenly so sick he can't possibly work today. - God. Was it something he ate? - Straighten up, please. - I don't know. - Well, can he work tomorrow? - Turn to your right. - Don't know that either. But you know what? I'm not going to worry about it. I had this dream last night, I was on set. You were in it, and another woman, somebody older. Anyway, everything was going wrong... and no matter how hard I tried to keep things together... the more they just fell apart. You know what that dream was telling me, Nicole? That I just have to roll with it. That's what I'm going to do today. I am rolling with it. So, we shoot the dream sequence. Hey, Tito, man, you look great! - I feel like shit! No, no, no, you look good, really. Hey, thank you so much for coming in on such short notice. This is, uh, Nicole. She's playing Ellen. Hi. Toto, is it? Tito. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Um, so listen. If there's anything I can do for you to... you just let me know. Put a stool in the bathroom. - Don't move, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Tito, Tito, your costume length... - Did I just offend him? - Why, what'd you say? - “Short notice." Please, that was nothing. I mean, my god, I'm the one who called him “Toto... You know, I am so out of it, I dreamt I was on the set last night too. - Yeah? - Yep. - You were in the dream. - Was I freaking out? Actually, you were. Great. I freak out in your dream. I freak out in my dream. No wonder I'm fucking exhausted. - Nick? - Yeah? Nothing. All right, GUYS- Special effects today. Could be kind of fun. Who knows how to work this baby? It's the old T160. I used it once in '85. - Damn. '85. - What's this? - That's where the gas go. - Nah, that's where the oil go. - Is it? - I'm pretty sure. How do you know? No, he's right. It's coming back now. I'm gonna let you handle this, Bob. This is your baby. Les, if he needs any help, give him a hand. Word. Okay, guys, we're all workin' together today. Yeah, it's comin' back now. It's like ridin' a bike. - T160, 1985. - (Nick): Anybody seen Wanda? - 1985, T160. - Way to go, Bob! - How we doin', Wanda? - Not good. Not bad, but not good. We have to finish this scene today and do scene 31. - Scene 31? Today? - Yeah. I don't even have my notes for Scene 31. I left my notebook at home. - Nobody told me we were doing scene 31. - Nick, Nick, Nick, I'll send someone to your apartment and they'll pick up the notes. Send someone to my apartment to get my red notebook. It's underneath the bed. Oh, fine. All right. Okay. It's taken care of. Thank you. Hey, Bob, get that smoke machine cranked up, buddy. I want a lot of smoke today. We're lit. The smoke machine's under control. - We're ready to go. - Yeah, but what about the dolly? Hey, just need to see a little run-through and we're all set. I'm gonna make your job easy today, Wanda. Hmm. Wandaful, wandaful, wandaful. Mmm. I sure am glad you wore that perfume. Hey, don't worry about Palomino. I'll take you to that jazz club tonight, yes. Oh, I can't tonight. I promised I'd visit Chad. He's extremely ill. Oh. By the way, my eye's much better. - Yeah? - Yeah. Listen, Wolf, come here. I know this may not be the best time to tell you this, but our relationship is going nowhere. What do you mean? Please don't take this personally, because I care for you, Wolf. I really do. But I've been feeling this way for quite awhile, and I really just think that it's best if we just end it. Okay? - Okay. - I think it's better. - So do I. - Well, good. - Yeah. Sure. - So we're still friends? Oh, well, great. Because, you know, I mean, we have to work together, and I don't think that it has to be unpleasant. No, no. Well, give me a hug. You are a real special guy, Wolf. Thanks. (sound man's voice): You're gonna have to put the microphone forward. (sound man): Don't you hear that? (sound man): Can you hear me? Oh. Okay. I'd like to get the A-team in here, please: Um, Ellen and Nick and Mr. Tito. Everyone pay attention. We are rehearsing scene six. I want it absolutely quiet. Director working with actors. Okay, listen up, here's the shot. We start wide with Ellen absolutely still in the middle of the frame. Okay? You with me, Wolf? - Yeah. - What happened to your eye? - Nothing. It's just a little sensitive today. - Can you see? - Of course I can see! Okay. Ellen is standing still and the smoke is flowing in. And your first line? "I am so hungry." Good. That's your cue, Tito. All right, then you come in, and you circle her once. You hold that apple out, just beyond her reach. You're reaching for it. Good, and you're staring at her hard. Harder. Good. Stop right there. All right. Can we get a mark, please? All right, then we dolly in to a medium shot. - What do you think? - It should be hand-held. No, I think it's better on the dolly. - Nick, do I see him? - No. You just see the apple. Tito, after that dolly in, give me a little laugh there at the end. A little laugh? Big, little, whatever you feel like doing. Okay? All right? Good. Let's shoot one. Call it, Wanda. Okay, here we go. The dream sequence is up. Action on the smoke machine. Okay, lock it up. Here we go. Roll sound. Speed. Roll camera. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Bob, could we get a little more smoke? Is that possible? - Oh, sure. - All right, good. Call it, Wanda. (Wanda): And roll sound. Speed. Roll camera. (Nick): Rolling. Scene six, take one. And... action! I am so hungry. Cut! That's a cut. Nick, comments? Yeah, just a couple. Okay, that was, uh... that was good. Tito, that was good, man, really. You didn't feel like laughing? - I laughed. - Oh. Okay, I guess I missed it. You can make it bigger. All right? And, Ellen, uh... maybe a little more tension when you see him. - I thought I didn't see him. - Right. Maybe you see him a little bit. All right, wait, do I see him or not? You see him. Okay. Okay. Then what is the tension? I mean, who is Toto? - It's Tito. - What did I say? - Toto. 0h, my god, I'm sorry. Tito, I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm doing that. Ellen, come on now, let's concentrate. Remember, tomorrow you're marrying Damian. You're a little anxious, and you have this dream. Let's call it an anxiety dream. And Tito represents the anxiety. Okay? - Sounds pretty simple, right? - Let's just try it. And, uh, Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one. All right? - Okay, more smoke. Good! Let's everybody just relax. This is the one right here. I still think it should be hand-held. Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-held. I want it on the dolly. Where's my notebook, Wanda? - It's on its way. - All right. Call it, Wanda. - All right, and roll sound. Speed. Roll camera. Rolling. Scene six, take two. Action! I am so hungry. - Cut! - That's a cut. - Nick, again? - Yes. - All right, we're going again right away. Okay, Ellen, good. I think you're on to something here. Good? I'm sorry, something's not right. This all feels fake to me. It's not fake! It's real! Just remember, you really want that apple, okay? Tito, I still think we could see more of a laugh at the end. What kind of laugh? - Just a laugh. - Show me. Oh. Okay, uh... I'm thinking maybe something like this. [laughing] Something like that. All right? Now remember, Tito, Ellen, this is a dream. It doesn't have to make sense. A laugh right there could heighten our sense of, uh... Anxiety. Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you? I still think it should be hand-held. Goddamn it! It's not going to be! I want it on the dolly! So why don't you just forget about it? And, Bob, what the fuck is with that smoke, man? You got a couple of hamsters in there blowing smoke rings for Christ's sake? The left septic valve wasn't open. I got it now. You're gonna see some smoke now. Okay, good. All right. Call it, Wanda. Uh, and, lock it up. Nick, I need to talk to you for a minute. What? In private. Okay, release the lockup, and everyone stand by. Yo, Bob, you still ain't getting no smoke, man. I really don't like being spoken to like this, Nick. I don't like your attitude. - I don't have an attitude. - The hell you don't! Every time I ask you to do something, it's "no, no, no, hand-held. " I'm sick of it! I hired you to do a job. If you're not going to do it, you better let me know right now. I'm... I'm sorry, Nick. I'm just going through some really heavy shit right now. - What do you mean? - I can't really talk about it, but it's pretty heavy. - Personal? Personal, professional and emotional. It's really doing a number on me, man. Now you're telling me that you're gonna fire me. I can't handle it. I never said that. Wolf, I'm not gonna fire you. You're doing a great job. - Am I? - Yeah, man. I don't know what I'd do without you. You've got a great eye. I just hope it's not the one under that eye patch. Hey, listen, Wolf. Let me tell you something I've learned. All right? Sometimes you just have to roll with things, you know? You're right. Yeah, so just, just, just roll with it, man. It'll be okay. Thanks, bro. - That's where the oil goes. - No, it's where the gas goes. I'm tellin' you, Bob, that's where the oil go. Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes? I don't remember using oil in '85. (woman's voice): That's a hard one. Maybe that's where both the oil and the gas go. - I...I think he's right. - I think he is too. Three parts gas, one part oil. (Nick): All right, we're all set now. Okay, everybody, come on, let's look alive here. Okay. - Is my notebook here yet? - Any minute, Nick. Good. Call it, Wanda. Action on the smoke machine, and roll sound. Speed. - Roll camera. - Rollin'. Scene six, take three. Action. I am so hungry. - Oh... shit. Uh... whoa! - Jesus! All right, cut, cut, cut! [explosion sound] Bob, are you okay? Pull the PH-IQ! - You all right? - I can't find the switch. All right, okay, all right! Clear the set! Ellen, Tito, please step off the set! - What did you do? - I'm off the set. - So am I. Well, who's that? - Nick, Wanda... - Who is that? Get off the set! I'm back with Nick's notebook. Please get us some water in here! ' "I, Nicky, _ Morn? Her name is Cora Reve. R-e-v-e. Blue housecoat, blue slippers. How do I know that? She's sitting 20 feet away from me. Yeah, well, sweetheart, that's gonna be a real fuckin' problem... because I don't have available people to go... She was waiting outside Nick's place when I went to get his notebook. She said she was looking for him, so I figured I should bring her here. You look really pretty in that dress. - How did you get here? - I took a bus here. - Went right to your apartment. - How did you get out of your room? Oh, I just went right through the door. - It was unlocked? - Oh, no, it was locked! I just went right through it. It's something I've learned to do, Nick. I can walk through just about anything, like air. Mom, you've got to stop this. I'm serious, okay? I'm a little upset with you. You could have gotten lost or hurt. But I wanted to see you, Nick. I miss you. Mom, I miss you too, but this is not really a good time. Nick, they're sending a car. It'll be here in a couple of hours. - They didn't even know she was gone. - Jesus, I don't believe this. Oh, I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was gonna be a wedding, I would have worn my fuckin' hat. Ho, ho, ho. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Over here, in this blue chair. All right, you just sit here. Can you see? Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics? Shh! No, Mom! Come on now. You've got to be quiet, all right? Absolutely quiet. Okay. Okay, where the hell are we? What's going on? How's the smoke machine? It's dead. I've got calls to every effects house in the city. I can't locate one here, but in Los Angeles... Okay, forget it, forget it! We'll shoot without it. - But, Nick, it is a dream sequence. I know, Wanda. It's okay. We still have Tito. All right? We'll just gonna have to roll with it. Right, Wolf? Yeah. All right. Good, here we go. - Ellen... all right, listen to me. - Nick, I... okay... You've got to reach for that apple. Keep reaching for it. I don't feel like you really want it. You're looking at it like, oh, it's an apple, yeah, but you gotta want it, all right? I don't know what you have to do, how many times I have to tell you. But you've got to want that apple, all right? Nicole, what... Two seconds, Wanda. Then we shoot, goddamn it! Nicole, what's the matter? You tell me. You're the one with the bug up your ass. Hey, wait just one second! You know, you've been picking on me all day, Nick! I can't do anything right! Well, I'm sorry if I've been short with you, Nicole, but I think you can see I'm under a little pressure here. I'm shooting a dream sequence without a smoke machine, I've got my mother inside thinking she's at a circus wedding... and then you tell me the whole movie seems fake! I never said that. You did too! You said, "everything feels fake"! I meant me! I feel fake! Everything I'm doing feels fake! I can't act! I should just do shower scenes... in Richard Gere movies for the rest of my life! Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a fantastic actress. All you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world. Don't give up. Understand? Okay. - You ready, Nick? - One second. You ready? - Yeah. - Come on. Look out. - Sorry, Nick. - How's your dress? Here we go. Everybody concentrate and focus. Tito, we're still looking for a little laugh, pal. - Heard you the first time. - Call it, Wanda. Okay, picture's up. There will be no smoke, in this scene, all right? No smoke. No smoke in the dream sequence. And lock it up. - Roll sound. Roll camera. - Speed. - Rolling. - Scene six, take four. Action. I am so hungry. Mfifn! (man's voice): That was great. What is the matter? Cut! (Wanda): Please stand by, people. It's only a momentary delay. We're gonna be going again right away. Listen to me, Mom. Do not move from this chair. Do you understand me? Jesus, you sound just like your father. Mom, I'm serious! Okay. Okay, I won't move. Thank you. - I won't move. - Okay, good. Very good. Tito... I think we're having a little communication problem here. - All I want you to do is laugh. Okay? - Why? - I told you why. - Tell me again. Look, Tito, you're overanalyzing this whole thing. All right? (Tito): I wanna be specific. (Nick): Good. Where'd you study? (Tito): That's irrelevant, where I studied. I just want you to know... - I'm just trying to get a feel... (Tito): In order to laugh, you don't need a technique. You just laugh. I want you to show me how to laugh. That's great, I showed you. I don't want you to copy my laugh. You just do whatever laugh. Think of the funniest thing... (Tito): What if I don't think anything's funny? (Tito): Maybe you could give me something funny. (Nick): I don't know your life, so you're gonna have to help me out here. (Tito): Well, it's not a very fun life. (Nick)! Okay? (Tito): Why? Look, Tito, it's not that big of a deal. It's a dream. Strange things happen in a dream. All I want you to do is laugh. Why is that such a problem for you? - Why does it have to be a dwarf? - What? Why does my character have to be a dwarf? - It doesn't have to be a dwarf. - Then why is he? Is that the only way you can make this a dream? Put a dwarf in it? No, Tito, I... Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them. The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Oh, make it weird. Put a dwarf in it. Everyone will go, "whoa, whoa, whoa! It must be a fuckin' dream! There's a fuckin' dwarf in it!" Well, I'm sick of it! You can take this dream sequence and shove it up your ass! ♪ [music playing] Nick, I can get right on the phone. We can try to get another small person here... as soon as possible. No. He's absolutely right. Do you wanna just shoot with Ellen, Nick? She could be in the dream by herself. No. We're not gonna shoot anything. I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, but... it's over. I can't take it anymore. I tried to roll with it... but it's time to face the music. I can't do this. The shoot is over. I give up. Shit. Take the camera off the dolly, start putting it away. (woman's voice): He can't be serious. Give me that apple. (Mom): I'm ready, Nick. (woman): What does that mean? (Nick): [whispering] Roll sound. Roll camera, Wolf. Roll camera. - Give me the camera. - Shh, shh, shh. - (Nick): Action. - I am so hungry. A' I'm so hungry. [laughter] Cut! Whoa, whoa, Wolf, talk to me, man. Did you get that? Got it! Nick, I'm tellin' ya, everything! - The laugh? - Yeah, see? Perfect! Now that's what I meant about goin' hand-held. You're a genius! - What about the focus? - Nailed it! Yes! Okay! All right! - Going again, Nick? - How was the sound? I could use another, but definitely acceptable. Mom, you kook! That was incredible! Did you know we were filming? - Of course I knew you were filming. You're a natural! Nicole, that was beautiful! That was it! Come here. Oh, don't you dare tell me that felt fake. - Going again, Nick? - Uh, all right, let me just think. Can I really use this for the dream sequence? That's the question. Does it work for the dream sequence? - We're gonna go with it, Wanda! - All right, everybody, listen up! That was a wrap on scene six! Put it there, pal! We're gonna roll with it! Hold it, hold it, hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it, hold it! - What? - I still have to record room tone. I'll need 30 seconds of silence. Okay, okay, everybody, 30 seconds of silence. I want to talk to you. - What's room tone? - You just have to be quiet, Mom. - Shut up! - It's for the sound guy. The sooner we do this, the sooner it's finished with. Quiet! Quiet! Now, nobody move! - Roll sound. - Speed. Mic's in position. Scene six, room tone, rolling. (Announcer): We have a new category this year: "Best film ever made by a human being." And the winner is... ♪ [music] None other than my best bud, Nick Reve! [loud applause] Had any experience? Um, well, I was, I was an actress for awhile. Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger? Probably. Oh! I'm sorry, Wolf. Please, please forgive me! I love you, Wolf! I love you! Give me another chance. Oh! Oh! [panting] You know what I love about you... is you're not afraid of my power. Oh, god, Wanda, I love your power. It's like an aphrodisiac to me! (woman): That's my big beef special. I'm gonna take it right over. (woman): Hey, Mo, how's your baby? Mmm. (woman): Dr. Zamansky, Dr. Zamansky, please call extension 2906. Dr. Hubert, Dr. Hubert, please call the administrator's office. In closing, I would... I would like to say to all the people out there... who told me not to make this movie... who, who said no to me when I asked them for money... who, who wouldn't even read the script or return a simple phone call. To my favorite teacher at film school who, whose parting advice to me was to, uh, try and find a job somewhere... teaching Spanish at a women's college. And to, uh... Delores Del Sorto, the girl I loved... I mean, I really loved in high school... who, who left me for... a-a-a junior varsity football player. To all these people and many more, I- I would love to say thank you, but I can't... because what I really feel like saying is... ugo fun. n And... that's a cut on room tone. - Okay, strike the set! - Oh! Sorry, Mom. Props, art department, we're moving on to scene 31. Sit down over there. Okay, let's go, people! Come on! Where's my notebook? Nick? Nick! Has anyone seen Nick? Can Nicole get out of her wardrobe? All right, camera off the dolly! Nick! I want a twenty on Nick.
