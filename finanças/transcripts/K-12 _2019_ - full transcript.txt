Wake up. You're gonna be late. Wait. What was my dream again? I remember feeling trapped in rising heat and there were plastic or cardboard cutouts all around me and my gums roots were pushing out my teeth and the voice of a thousand angels said to me, "It's temporary." Maybe that should be my mantra as I step into what will inevitably be the worst years of my life. Ah yes, off to a world in which girls are to only wear pink dresses and boys blue pants. Well, I dyed my uniform and embroidered flowers on the sleeves. Speaking of, I should probably change into my uniform right now. Nah, that shit's itchy. It can wait. Oh yea, and in my dream, you know when the air below me was sucking my teeth out of their sockets, I noticed that my front two teeth stayed and the gap between them just kept getting larger and larger. How's that even possible? I know right? I wish my Mom wasn't passed out right now and could at least drive me to the bus stop. Phillipe? What are you doing in there? Don't scare me like that. What was that angel's name again? Was it Willy or Layla? No, I think it was Lilith. Feel so sick. I can't believe we have to do this. Do you think we'll make any friends? - I hope so, but at least we have each other. - That's true. Okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Seriously? What does it say? Real mature. Aw, sad wittle baby! Go on! Does the bunny wabbit need some tissues? I bet she has some in her bra. It's okay, just ignore them. Just plastic assholes. Crybaby, wah-wah! Wah-Wah! Crybaby! Wah-wah! Wah-wah, wah-wah!
