It's 12:00. Let's call it a day. Do you hear me, Grover Cleveland Alexander? I'll be right down. - Number please. - Hello, Miss Elsie. - Would you please ring 31J at Elba? - Oh, how are you, Grover? - Fine, Miss Elsie. - I'm ringing Aimee for you. I'll get it, Father. - Hello? - Hello, Aimee? Grover's calling. - Hello, Aimee. - Hello, Grover. - Are you through for the day? - Yep. Well, now, don't forget you're supposed to meet me, and make it the Crandall place instead of in town. The Crandall place? Why there? Now, don't start asking questions, Grover. You just be there. How long will it take you? Well, we're about halfway out the Central City road. I can make it by 2:00, I think. Say, don't forget, Ma's expecting you and your Pa over to our house for supper tonight. Oh, we haven't forgotten. Now, hurry up, dear. - I will, Aimee. - Goodbye, Grover. Goodbye, Miss Elsie. Goodbye, Aimee. Goodbye, Miss Elsie. Bye, Grover. Bye, Aimee. Goodbye, Miss Elsie. Father, won't he be surprised? I only hope I'm doing the right thing. I ought to take all those calls to Aimee out of your pay. Have to test the circuits, don't I? When are you and her gonna get married? Soon as I can save enough for a place of our own. We got a farm all picked out now. You can't play catch and plow at the same time, boy. I got a picture of you being a farmer. Is that so? Well, me and Aimee's gonna make a deposit on the Crandall place. Get the bank to hold it until I can raise the rest of the down payment. You'll see. I'm the best farmer ever worked for the phone company. Hi-yo, baby. - Hey, that fella going to a fire? - Giddyup, there. Whoa, baby! Alex, Central City needs you to pitch for them this afternoon. They got up a game with a barnstorming bunch of professionals. This afternoon? Well, why don't they get Clay to pitch? He got kicked by a horse yesterday. Can't walk. He sure can't pitch sitting down. They need you, Alex. Pay you $1.50 for the game. - Who they playing? - A real team, Alex. Galesburg, from the Three-Eye League. Regular paid ball players? Yeah. They're only playing this one game here. Then they keep on going east to start their regular season. They got uniforms and everything, Alex. Central City needs you bad. There won't be any game without you to pitch for them. - What time's the game start? - 2:00. We gotta step on it to get there in time. - Let's go. - I don't wanna miss this game. I don't wanna miss any game Alex is pitching. I'd sure like to get a bet down if Alex is gonna pitch. Yep, he's sure got his heart set on being a farmer. $186.50 on Central City. It's payday in these parts, Mr. Glasheen. You giving odds? Yes, sir. 2-to-1. You're covered. Like taking candy away from babies. That's their pitcher. Yes, sir, a fella could cut himself a chaw of the bac and work up a good spit before that ball gets to the plate. Play ball! All right, Snyder, get up there and get a hit. We got a ground rule here. If a fielder loses the ball in the grass, you only get one extra base. Well, boys, we're gonna make a real killing today. All right, Dean, get a hold of one. Batter up. Strike one. Strike two. Come on, Dean, get a piece of it. Send this hayseed back to the farm. Come on, Alex, right in to me. The big one, boy, the big one. Right in to me, Alex. Quite a hayseed, ain't he? Come on, Aimee. Father, I'm sure he isn't out playing baseball, because he knew that he was supposed to meet us here. He couldn't have forgotten about it. Aimee, if you want to marry the boy, I'm not gonna stand in your way. But I ain't gonna help you to do it neither. I knew I was wrong when I agreed to put the down payment on this farm for your wedding present. Well, now I'm not gonna do it. Well, I know he has a reason. He must have. Because I know that boy ain't cut out to be any farmer. He ain't cut out to be anything but just what he is, a fella that wants to play. Well, come on, let's go over to his mother's place. Just because he disappointed us is no reason for us to disappoint her. Oh, what a wonderful surprise it would have been for him. If you keep on counting on Alex, you're the one who's gonna get all the surprises. Giddap! Come on, you can do it, now! Get a hold of one! - Come on! - Come on! Come on, you can hit him. That's the way, baby. That's the way. Come on, hit that ball! Work hard, Alex. Work hard, baby. Strike three, you're out! Can't you hit that pusher? Strike one. Come on, Alex, boy. Let's get this man out of here. Make a batter of him, boy. Plow it through here. Come on, Alex, boy. Come on, right in to me, baby. Right in to me. All right, get in there and just don't stand there and let him throw 'em by you this time. Get a hit! Ninth inning, two men out and you're telling me to get a hit? Imagine us getting shut out by a hayseed. Oh, come on, Pinkie. You can do it, now. You can do it. All right, get a hit, now, Pinkie, boy, get a hit. Strike one. Come on, get on. He's taking all our dough. Strike two! That guy never throw anything but strikes? - Right in to me, Alex, boy, right in to me. - Get in there! That's it, Alex! You did it. Bravo! Maybe you could tell Aimee... No, she'd never believe that. I don't know what I was thinking about. Alex, with a woman you gotta let her know right off who's boss. Or after you're married, she'll just make your life miserable. Tell her you were playing baseball. Dare her to do anything about it. Thanks for the lift, Fred. - Hello, all. - Did you win? Yeah. - What team did you beat, Grover? - Galesburg, a real league team. Gee, Mom, I'm sorry about being so late. Aimee's in the kitchen. - Her father went home right after supper. - Oh. What was the score? One to nothing. Aimee's awful mad at you, Grover. Hello, Aimee. Guess I'm kind of late for supper, huh? Well, it was this way, Aimee. You see, right after I talked to you, Fred came along and he said how this professional team was gonna play Central City. Except that there wouldn't be any game at all if I didn't pitch, on account of Clay got kicked by a horse. Well, so there was nothing I could do about it since everybody was counting on me. And of course you couldn't disappoint everybody. Well, no. You see how it was. Yes, I do see. You don't want to get married and settle down. Now, Aimee. And I had the most wonderful surprise all ready for you, too. That's why I asked you to come to the Crandall place. Father was all set to make a down payment as a wedding present so that we could get married and have a place of our own. And what do you do? You go out and play baseball. Well, you spoiled everything. Maybe if I explain to your father. You see, this wasn't just an ordinary ball game. This was a real team I pitched against. These fellows make their living playing baseball. And I beat them. Oh, you'd have been real proud if you could've seen the way I set them back on their heels. I didn't walk a single man. They only got three hits off me. Look, I got $1.50 for pitching that game. And here's my $35 pay from the phone company. We'll get that farm and without any help from your father. He doesn't think that I should ever marry you, Grover. He said it doesn't make any difference what you do for a living, if anybody came and asked you to play baseball, you'd drop everything and go play. Well, he's wrong, and I'll prove he's wrong. I got it all figured out. In three months I'll have enough saved for the down payment. Then we get married. We'll both prove he was wrong. That is, unless you feel about me the way he does. Do you, Aimee? I promise I'll never do it again. Honest. Grover, I don't care if you play baseball once in a while, but it shouldn't be your whole life. It should just be something to sort of relax you, like when Father plays checkers, you know? Or like when Mr. Johnson makes little boats and puts them in bottles? From now on, baseball's a hobby. I'll even let Johnson teach me how to make little boats and put them in bottles. Promise. All right. Now come eat your supper. The chicken got tired of waiting, too. We're all ready to begin. Please be seated. We're now going to be entertained and educated by the famous explorer, traveler and lecturer, Mr. Carlson Carleton. We are indeed fortunate that Mr. Carleton was able to delay his trip east in order to stay over and exhibit his marvelous pictures in this community. I'm sure I speak for all the members of my congregation when I say we are honored by your presence, sir. Both at our church services and now. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please close the doors. Today we are going to visit Norway. This is Norway. Focus, please. And turn the slide around. Of all the countries on our globe, little Norway must, in some respects, rank as the most wonderful. Nearly one-third of its area lies within the Arctic Circle. Very cold, you say? No. Nature's miracle, the Gulf Stream, and its warm breath, transforms an otherwise barren region into a fertile land. Please, close that door. I arrived in Christiana and went directly to the Hotel Victoria. After a hearty breakfast of herrings, I went in search of Bennett. I asked everyone, "Where is Bennett, the living encyclopedia of Norway?" Where's Alexander, the pitcher? I'm looking for Grover Cleveland Alexander. You in here, boy? Who is he? I say, my good man, we are gathered here... Oh, excuse me, buster. Alexander, wherever you are, come on outside. I wanna talk to you. Oh, there you are. Glad to see you, boy, glad to see you. Couldn't find you in the dark. Yes, sir. Drove all the way up from Central City to find you. Wanted to tell you what a fine game you pitched yesterday. Well, thanks, but we're right in the middle of a lecture in there. Well, you remember me, don't you? I'm George Glasheen, manager of the Galesburg team. Sure. - What do you do for a living, Alexander? - Work for the phone company. Did you ever think of playing ball for a living? Used to think about it a lot, till last night. Well, I got a couple of gloves and a ball in the car here. Throw me a few, I wanna see what you've got. Glad to. - How long you been pitching? - Ever since I can remember. When I wasn't throwing a ball, I was throwing a rock. You had pretty good control yesterday. Were you lucky, or do you have it all the time? Just show me where you want it, Mr. Glasheen. Put it high and outside. Now, let's see, here. Where was I? Oh, yes. Anyway, the farmer and his wife were very hospitable and gave me a fine supper. As I was leaving, I turned to the wife and said... Show me a curve! I asked her if Norwegians preferred pork to fish. And she replied... Hot ziggety! Now burn it in! - You got a lot of stuff on that ball, boy. - Oh, just practice. How'd you like to join my team? - Pay you $100 a month. - A hundred? - Aimee. He said he'd pay 100... - I heard what he said. - Your girl? - Yeah, Aimee, this is Mr. Glasheen. - He manages the Galesburg... - You ought to ashamed. Both of you. Yelling and throwing that ball and making a big racket right during the lecture. Why, I never. - Don't you have any manners at all? - What about it, Alexander? He is staying right here and we're going to buy a farm and get married. And you can go to... You can go right back where you came from. But, Aimee, wait a minute. Grover Cleveland Alexander, you made me a promise last night. - Do you remember it? - Oh, sure I do. But, Aimee, $100 a month? And it would only be for the summer, wouldn't it, Mr. Glasheen? - Grover? - Aimee, don't you see? We could have the all the money we need by the end of the summer, if I join the team. You made me a promise. Either you keep it or not. Now make up your mind. She'll get over it. Girls are nuts about baseball players. Not that girl. We're playing Omaha this Wednesday. If you wanna take my offer, be there and be ready to pitch. Make up your mind, boy. Strike three, you're out! You're out! Glasheen, where'd you find this Alexander? I found him in my Christmas stocking. Here, have a drink. Nice going, boy. Here, have a drink. Great game. - No letter for me, huh? - No, Mr. Alexander. Aimee. Trashy song. Thanks. He's broke too many promises, Aimee. Don't believe him anymore. I think he means it this time. Look, more money for the farm. Maybe he really is only playing in order to buy it. That's what he told me. He's told you a lot of things, Aimee. Not a one of them has come true yet. Ball four. Take a walk. Time. That pitcher's really washed up giving you a free ride. Well, you're gonna win your 16th straight today, boy. He ain't won't it yet. Listen, I don't want you to take no slides, you hear? You might hurt your arm. All right now, heads up. Take a good lead now. You're all right. Alex. Aimee? Yes, dear? This is Aimee. - Hello, Aimee. - Hello. Your mother's here, too. - Hello, Mom. - Hello, son. How'd you get here so quick? - It's been almost three days. - Oh. You're not mad at me anymore? Every time we'd get to a new town, I'd hope there'd be a letter waiting for me. Never was. Grover, I put all the money that you sent in the bank. We have enough now for a down payment on the farm, if you still want it. Sure. - You want a drink, son? Here, let me... - No, Mom. Wait a minute. Grover, what's the matter? Nothing. I'm twice as good as I ever was. I see two of everything. Tell me when you see just one. One now? No, still two. Let's try it again. How's that? They just won't come together, Doc. Well, there's no doubt about it. - Diplopia. - What's that mean? Double vision. Caused by injury to the eye muscles. Well, how long will it take to fix him up, Doc? I don't know. There's nothing medicine can do to help him. Sometimes these cases clear up in a few weeks, or it might be for the rest of your life. You mean he can't pitch anymore? I'm kind of wondering how straight a furrow I'll be able to plow on that farm of ours. Best pitcher I ever had. Ever seen. And I was worrying about his arm. That's just my luck for you. Anyway, I can see two of you. Makes you twice as pretty. Come on, you're gonna ride to your new farm in my new automobile. - Oh, look. - Look at it, isn't it wonderful? Your brothers and me will be over tomorrow to help you get started with your planting. I'll send one of the boys over tonight to do the milking for you right after supper. You take good care of my little girl, you hear? I aim to, Mr. Arrants. All right, get in, you two. - Goodbye, Aimee. - Goodbye. - Bye! - Bye! Goodbye. Hey, Johnson, you better get a horse. You'd make better time if you walked, Grover. Wind her up again, Jim. - No fancy new car. - Whoa. Give me a horse anytime. - Them automobiles is just a fad. - Goodbye, Aimee. Goodbye, we're proud to have you, dear. - Bye! - Goodbye! - Take good care of her, son. - Take it easy, now. Bye, Aimee. - Bye! - Bye, Aimee. - Bye! - Goodbye. I'll send the boys over tomorrow to help you out. Giddyup. Come on, boy. - Bye! - Bye! Bye! Thought I only made a down payment on one house. One's for summer, one's for winter. All my wives get carried over the threshold. I could've sworn there was a door there. Me, too. Say, seems like we're all set up. Don't we have wonderful friends? Look how they fixed up our house for us. This was your mother's favorite table. And Mrs. Robbins' chair. - Real nice. - Real comfortable, try it. Come quick. Look. Oh, look! Doesn't it look good? Say, maybe they figured on being invited in. Only two people are gonna be at my honeymoon supper. Me and my husband. I'll go change. Dear. And he does that every day? I think he knows that he can't ever play again, but he keeps on trying. But he's through. Well, if you know that, Mr. Glasheen, how could you do this? Trade him to Indianapolis? That has nothing to do with it. You know, business is business. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Alexander. Don't you want to say hello to him? Oh, I figure it'd be better if I didn't. You know, it might upset him. Remind him of... Just tell him, well, that I said good luck. And, Mrs. Alexander, I know you ain't much of a fan, but leastwise you know you're married to a guy who could've been the greatest pitcher baseball ever had. - Let's quit, Grover. I'm tired. - Oh, just a few more. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, is it cold! - Those are for Christmas. This is for the day before. - Here's your mail, Grover. - Oh, thanks. I'll bet they're Christmas cards. Hurry and open it. Oh, isn't that a beautiful one? "Greetings and best wishes for Christmas and the New Year." Oh, isn't that... It's from Peewee Johnson. He played shortstop for Galesburg. Oh, did he? Look, Mom. - Let's see it. - Isn't this beautiful? - Isn't that lovely? - Look at the birds. It's a barn. Like the one we used to have. Is that another one? It's from the Philadelphia Nationals. The Phillies? That's a big league team. What is it? It's from Charles Dooin, manager. "This is to inform you we have purchased your contract from Indianapolis. "Spring training begins March 4th in Southern Pines, North Carolina. "I'm looking forward to meeting you then. "I know you'll be a big asset to our team." Can't trade me much higher, can they? Why did they do that to him? Keeping up his hopes, breaking his heart. Aimee. Mom, it's so awful for him. He's tried so hard to be a good farmer. To be everything that I wanted him to be. And all the time, he's sick inside because he can't ever pitch again. You know something, Mom? I used to think it'd be a lot better if he liked another girl. Then at least I could compete against her and win or lose. But I couldn't compete against his love for baseball. Anybody would've been second to that. Now, Aimee... Mom, I was glad when he had his accident. - You don't mean that, Aimee. - Yes, I do. Deep down in my heart I was glad because it meant that he could never play again. And that meant that I wouldn't have to share him with the game. Now I realize how wrong I was, and I'd do anything if I could help him. Mom, I love him so much. I want him to be happy. I want him to be able to do all the things that he wants to do. Now I know that I can't help him. I can't give him the things that he wants and needs. Oh, Mom. Aimee! Oh, darling. Oh, darling. If we're going to be in North Carolina in time for spring training, we'll have to leave tomorrow. Aimee. But what about the farm? Oh, we could talk to Ray. He'll take care of everything for us. Sure, he will. Sure. Peanuts! Who'll have the peanuts? Peanuts here. - I will. - Peanuts? - How much are they? - Five cents. Who'll have a bag of peanuts here? Attaboy, Alex! Hit this target, kid. - Hello. - Hello. I think it's plain silly to play a preseason game between the Phillies and the Athletics. Connie Mack has a world champion team and the poor Phillies haven't been out of the second division since I can remember. You mean the Phillies aren't very good? You can't make chicken salad out of chicken feathers, honey. Have they announced the batteries yet? - The what? - The batteries. Who's pitching? My husband is supposed to pitch the first five innings. That's him down there, warming up with William Killefer. His name is Grover Alexander. Well, I'm glad to meet you. Your name's Aimee, isn't it? Bill's told me about you and your husband. I'm Margaret Killefer. I'm pleased to meet you. - I didn't see you at spring training. - Wasn't there. Isn't that Eddie Plank that's gonna pitch for the As? Is he good? In a way. Only won 22 games last year. Is that all? Well, my husband told Mr. Dooin, the manager, that he'd figured on winning at least 25, and maybe more. And he's just a rookie. And what did Mr. Dooin say? Nothing. I can't think of anything either. - Peanut? - Thank you. Batteries for today's game! For the Athletics, Plank pitching, Lapp catching! For the Philadelphia Nationals, Alexander pitching, Killefer catching! Alexander, you're pitching the first five innings, if you can last that long. You'll get murdered, but you'll learn something. Yes, Mr. Dooin. Now, remember something, you've got eight men helping you out there, so don't be trying to strike everybody out. You'd be wasting time, anyway. You might hurt your arm. Just tease them with that curve ball. Play ball! Be smart, save that arm. All right, come on, let's go! Let's get out there, show these world champions they can't have everything their own way today. The first batter up will be Eddie Collins, Alex. He hit.322 last year, .492 in the World Series, but don't let that bother you. Just don't throw him anything waist high. All right, play ball! - How are you, Reindeer? - Fine, Eddie. How's it with you? You guys give up too easy, starting a rookie against us. Everybody's got to begin someplace. All right, gang, let's go! Play ball! I can't call them till you throw them, boy. Yes, sir. All right, Alex. Ball! - That's bad, is it? - That's bad. Ball! Come on, Grover! Ball! Settle down, now, Alex. Pitch to me, boy. This white thing's the plate, boy. You're supposed to come somewhere close to it. Strike! That's good. Strike! That's it. Pour it on, boy, you can do it! Where'd you get this kid, Bill? Indianapolis, why? Well, they can have him back, right after this next pitch. Come on, Grover. Strike! You're out! Same rules as last year, Eddie. Three strikes to a customer. You're out. Next batter up. Hornsby coming to bat. What's this St. Louis rookie's first name? Rogers. Rogers Hornsby. He's too anxious in the field and he can't hit. Alexander's struck him out twice now. Once more and the Cards will send him back to minors. Well, it's now or never. Strike! - Time. - Time. What's the matter, Bill? If this Hornsby kid doesn't get a hit, Huggins is gonna drop him. We've got this one on ice. Tell him I'll put it right down the middle. Play ball! It's coming right down the middle, kid. Strike! I told you it'd be right in there for you. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! That hit was a present, Hornsby. It's the best one I'll ever get. What a great guy. Play ball. How does Alex feel about him and Bill Killefer being sold to Chicago? Well, he's looking forward very much to wearing a Cub uniform and, of course, playing for Mr. Wrigley. In fact, he went to see him this morning at Catalina Island. How does Alex stand in the draft? Is the army taking him? He received his greetings yesterday. When does he have to report, Mrs. Alexander? Tomorrow. - Hi! - Hello, Alex! - How does it feel being with the Cubs? - Hello, Alex, how you doing? When are you gonna start throwing grenades instead of baseballs? I'm sure Aimee answered all your questions and, seeing as how I haven't got much time left, I'd like to spend it with her. - Okay. - Okay, Alex. - Good luck. - Just one picture, please. - Bye. - Good luck. - Smile, please. - Ready. Thanks a lot. - Good luck, Alex. - Bye, now. Bye. And how's Mr. Wrigley? - Oh, he's wonderful. - Is he? He's about the nicest man I ever met. - Is he? - Sit down. I told him I was worried about how you were gonna get along while I was in the army. Well, we don't have to worry anymore. - You know what he's going to do? - What? He's gonna send you a check for $500 every other month as long as I'm gone. We talked it all over while we were playing golf and he asked me if I thought it sounded fair and when I said it did, he told me to stop talking or he'd miss his putt. He's quite a fella. So are you. And if I'm not back inside of three years, he's gonna give you $10,000. Alex, if anything happens to you, I'll never speak to you again. - One degree left! - One degree left! Fire when ready! - Ready! - Clear! Fire when ready! What's the matter, Sarge? I don't know. I just got dizzy all of a sudden. Fall out! - Aimee! - Fall out! Alex! She saw me first. I'm so glad to see you. Are you all right? - I'm all right. Now, how are you? - I'm all right. Hey! What'd you do to your hair? Are you getting bald? No, it's the latest style. Do you like it? I love it! Hey, let's go someplace and get out of this crowd. Start on another honeymoon. It'll have to be on a train because we have to go to Chicago and join the team right away. It can be a slow train. One that'll take us weeks to get there. Batteries for today's game. For New York, Mathewson pitching, Jones catching. For Chicago, Alexander pitching, Killefer catching. Hey, welcome home, Alex. Welcome home! Welcome home, Alex! They remember you, don't they? You've given them something to remember, Alex. This Pittsburgh club is hot, leading the league. They'll be tough to beat here on their home ground. Now, you all remember Foy, he was with us early this season. No arm, no speed. Whenever he gets on second base, we'll change our signals. If there's any chance of that guy getting as far as second, we wouldn't have sold him, would we? All right, let's go. Oh, forgot my glove. Hey, Alex, the coach wants you to warm up right away. Hey, Alex, did you hear me? Come on, Alex. What's going on? You passed out on the mound. Well, if that ain't the silliest thing I ever done. How's the game? It's over for you, Alex. Take your shower. I'm all right, there's only a few innings left. He thinks you got a sunstroke. I'm not sending you back out there for another one. Go on back to the hotel and get to bed early. You need some rest. You know what that temperature is out there? A hundred and four. I wouldn't be surprised if both teams folded up before they finish this one. I used to plow all day when it was 110, never fazed me before. ...and you say the first time before the game began it was like your mind revolving? Well, yes, it was kind of like a bright light inside my head. So bright, it hurt my eyes. It was real strange, everything moving, and I almost didn't make it to a bench. Any of these sensations a second time while you were pitching? No. I started my wind up and nothing. I didn't know anything until I came to in the locker room. When was it you were hit by that baseball? 1911. I had double vision for almost a year after that. Any of these blackouts during that period? No. Oh, during the war I had a few dizzy spells, but never fainted or anything. - Were you wounded? - No. Hard of hearing for a while. Being a gunnery sergeant's not what you'd call a quiet job. What did you do before you played baseball, Alex? Farming, mostly. Worked for the phone company. Aimee, that's my wife, we got a little farm just outside of Elba, Nebraska. - Why? - Farm work'd be good for you. You telling me I gotta quit baseball? If you want to live out your normal life expectancy. Baseball is my life, Doc. Alex, doctors don't know much about your kind of trouble. You'll have periods when you feel just fine, then one of these blackouts will hit you. You'll never know when, never get much of a warning. You can fall down anywhere, anytime. While pitching, at bat, running the bases, sitting at a table in a restaurant. And each time it happens, it'll take strength out of you that will never come back. No fixing it? How are you at keeping a secret, Doc? Well, I'm good at it, but you can't keep this kind of a thing secret very long, Alex. You came to me because you didn't want your team doctor to find out. But when he does, you'll be out of baseball. I don't want my wife to know. Alex, you've set records in baseball that'll never be topped. Why don't you retire, go to your farm? With the price of hogs as high as it is... If I'm going to fall down again, I don't wanna do it in a pigsty. I've got it. - Here, keep the change. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Alexander. - Aren't you Grover Cleveland Alexander? - Yeah. Well, say, come on in. I'd like to buy you a drink. Oh, come on. Hey, Johnny, look who I found. Alex the Great. - Sure glad to know you, Mr. Alexander. - Fix him up, Johnny. It ain't often we get the best pitcher in the National League as a customer. Hey, I was at Forbes Field today. What happened to you? - The heat, too much sun. - Yeah, sure was a broiler, all right. On the house, Mr. Alexander, and it's the real McCoy. None of that bathtub stuff. Chaser? - A little seltzer? - Yeah. Is this what they mean about getting drunk? Makes you feel real light and airy and like your feet aren't really on the ground. You're not drunk. You talk too straight. It's like the world's a real fine place, and there's nothing to worry about, and nothing to ever be afraid of. You're getting there, Alex. This is almost the most wonderful feeling I ever had. It's like I know I'm me and I know what's wrong. You don't know. But I do. Doesn't seem to matter so much anymore. You're getting mighty close, Alex. Soon as you start feeling sorry for yourself, then you're almost there. - Number, please. - Walnut, 8239. - Pittsburgh Tribune. - Sports desk. Just a moment, please. - Hello. - Hello, this is Crosland. Zimmy around? Hold on. - Yes? - Zimmy, got a big story for your column. Grover Alexander passed out on the mound in today's game, didn't he? Yeah. From the heat, my eye. The guy was loaded. Baby, your big dream pitcher's a great, big lush. Margaret, what's happening? Why is he doing this? I've got to go to St. Louis and find out for myself. But the team will be home day after tomorrow. But I can't even get him on the phone. What's done this to him? There must be some reason for this sudden... I mean, there must be some reason. Come on. - Get him, get him, get him! - Safe! Time. Metkovitch. Anybody can slip, Joe. The grass is a little wet. Metkovitch now pitching. Can't you even talk to me anymore, Alex? After all we've been through together? You can tell me. You can tell me anything. - There's nothing to tell. - Darling, what's happened to you? You never drank before. Why now? All of a sudden. Why? Alex, what are you afraid of? Stop badgering me, Aimee. Well, I've looked every place I can think of. He hasn't been even to the speakeasies that he usually goes to. - Hello? - Hello, Mrs. Alexander? - Yes. - This is the Lincoln Park Police Station. We've got your husband down here again. All right, Aimee. I'll go get him. Thanks, Bill. But I won't be here when you get back. I haven't helped him by staying. Maybe I can help by going away. Yes, baseball fans, this was a sad season for one of the greatest pitchers the game has ever known. Grover Cleveland Alexander, who really earned the title, "Alex the Great," drank himself right out of baseball. Seemingly overnight, the genial big farmer from Nebraska turned from baseball to the bottle. Whatever it was that changed Grover Alexander from the greatest control pitcher of all time into a stumbling has-been is a mystery to the men who played with and against him. They are saddened by what has happened to Alex, and so are we. He was once a great man. - Pittsburgh Press. - Hello, Pittsburgh Press? I guess I want your sports department. Just a moment, please. Hello? Hello. My name is Conant, Dr. Johnson Conant. Could you possibly tell me where I could get in touch with the wife of Grover Cleveland Alexander? ...and so when I heard that radio broadcast, I felt it my duty to find out if you knew the facts about your husband, even though I'd promised to keep the information secret - for the sake of his career. - Why didn't he tell me? Now, don't start blaming yourself, Mrs. Alexander. After all, you didn't know. Frankly, I'm amazed he managed to hide his affliction at all. Everybody thought that... Even I thought, Doctor, those times when he... That it was from drinking. Well, I don't wonder. From what I've learned, many of those times probably were from drinking. He shouldn't drink at all in his condition. Yet I can understand why he does. Maybe it makes him less afraid. Maybe he thought it better for you and others to believe it was liquor that made him fall down. - Where is he now, do you know? - No. Take one of these, Mrs. Alexander. It'll relax you. Don't worry about me, Doctor. I'm all right. It's him. - I left him when he needed me. - If there's anything I can do... Thank you very much for writing and explaining. I've got to find him. What do you mean, you're dependable? You on the wagon? I promise you, I'll always be sober on the mound. Well, I don't know. All the stories I've heard about you... I can win you a lot of ball games. I can still pitch. I can only pay you by the game, I can't put you on salary. That's all right with me. I'll give you 20 bucks when you pitch. But you got to stay at least six innings to earn it. And when I win? I'll make it $25. House of David's got itself a pitcher. Get in a uniform and work out with the boys. You guys must be pretty good with that hidden ball trick. Sorry, Mrs. Alexander, I've no idea where he might be. Well, if you should hear where he is, Mr. McGraw, would you please let me know? - I'll do that. - Thank you. Bye. I haven't seen him, Aimee, but I'll ask around and let you know the minute I hear. Down! Down! Slide! You're out. All right, men, let's get out in the field. Alexander, are you drunk again? Not much. Fremont, warm up. Not drunk. Not... All right, drag him to the locker room. This is the last time you'll have to do it. He's through. He pitched one game with an amateur team in Joplin, Missouri. Then he played two weeks with a semi-pro outfit in Marshall, Texas. Then this morning, the investigation agency that we work with in Nashville wired they had a lead that your husband is playing with a team called the House of David. - Do they know where the team is? - No, but we're working on it. Mrs. Alexander, I'll let you know as soon as we find out. Thank you, Mr. Blake. No, Mrs. Alexander, he left my team in Texas more than two weeks ago. I don't know where he is. Sorry. Unless he's under a table in some speakeasy. There is absolutely no waiting for seats. There ain't no seats. Come and see El Diablo, the world's greatest fire-eater. Learn all about baseball from the one and only Grover Cleveland Alexander the Great. If you are interested in baseball, there's the man who will answer all your questions. Do you want me to go inside with you? Alex the Great. The great baseball player. Step up and buy yourself a ticket for the little lady, and give yourself a treat. That had a vanilla flavor. Tasted more like custard. Anybody like to try it just hold your face up here. Have a little drink. Hey, fire! And now, my friends, you can show your appreciation for the talents of El Diablo by purchasing one or more of his photographs. All right, Alexander, get it up here. And now, ladies and gentlemen, before we move on to the center attraction of the museum, and of course by that I mean the one and only flea circus, where you will see the most amazing, the most incredible performances of all time. But right now, I would like to have your attention here. You baseball fans, move in a little closer, because right here on this stage you are going to see, hear and be able to ask questions of the one and only, Alex the Great. Grover Cleveland Alexander broke into big league baseball in 1911. He has set many pitching records which will never be equaled. He is going to tell you some of his secrets. Two minutes, Alexander, and don't start no arguments with no customers, you understand? It's a pleasure to talk to true baseball fans. I broke into big league baseball with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1911. I won 28 games my first season, 13 of those were shutouts. In 15 years of big league competition, I've won 318 games for an average of better than 21 wins per season. How many did you lose? I lost 171. How does it feel to be living off the fleas? Well, it's better than having them live off of me. I have often been asked who's the toughest batter to pitch to. Any pitcher can answer that one. Rogers Hornsby. The only safe way to pitch to him is low and behind him. Now, if any of you'd like to ask me some questions about baseball, I'll do my best to answer them. What right have you got to stand up there talking about baseball? You never did nothing but give baseball a bad name. Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Take it easy! Where is he, Aimee? I'll send him some money so that he can... But it isn't money that he needs. What can I do to help Alex? Believe in him. Give him a chance. Let him play baseball again, Rog. But, Aimee... Don't you understand? It isn't enough that I believe in him. Baseball's got to believe in him, too. Well, I'll have to think it over. Please, Rog, give him back his life. Aimee, I'll do the best I can. I'll let you know one way or the other. Goodbye. She wants me to take him on. How can I, Bill? You're the manager of the Cards. You can hire and fire. I'm responsible for the team. We're going along pretty good. I'm even crazy enough to believe we can win the pennant. How can I risk taking Alexander on? What'll I tell the owners? You know Alex is through. Well, isn't he? That's what everybody says, "Alex is through." Well? Except I don't believe it, Rog. As long as Alex can stand on his two feet, he's still the pitcher I'd wanna have in there if we were in a tough spot, and so would you. Hey, Mr. Alexander. A scout's here from the St. Louis Cardinals to see you. Tell him to wait a minute. Come in. Rogers Hornsby needs you and wants you to report to the team right away. And here's a telegram to prove it. Why didn't you tell me? It is truly amazing what Rogers Hornsby has been able to do with the St. Louis team. Last year, the Cardinals ended the 1925 season at the bottom of the second division. This year, with a roster of nothing but rookies, castoffs and has-beens, Hornsby has turned the Cards into the most formidable baseball club in the National League. Grover Alexander, who practically kicked himself out of baseball, was given another chance by the Cards manager and paid off with the most amazing comeback in sports history. Time after time, Hornsby has literally lifted his weak but scrappy team by its bootstraps and forced them to be better than anybody could believe was possible. Good enough to win the National League Pennant, the first in St. Louis Cardinal history. But now the big question is, what possible chance have these worn-out Cardinals got against the mighty Yankees in the World Series? The Bronx Bombers are unquestionably the most powerful aggregation of baseball players ever assembled on one team. The wise boys are putting it on the line that the Yankees will win four straight. The best that can be predicted is that the St. Louis Cardinals will at least go down fighting. Thank you very much. Maybe we shouldn't even bother to show up at the Yankee Stadium tomorrow. Hey, look at this. What do they mean, "old man"? I don't mind that so much, but I wouldn't wear a beard even when I was playing with the House of David. They should all be so old and so wise. Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Graham McNamee bringing you the first transcontinental sports broadcast in history. Yes, la dies and gentlemen, it's the World Series coast to coast. The Yankee Stadium is packed with the largest crowd to ever attend any baseball game. There are more than 61,000 fans here. Miller Huggins is starting pitcher Herb Pennock against the Cardinals. Pennock won 23 and lost 11 during the season. Catching is Henry Severeid. The starting pitcher for St. Louis will be Wee Willie Sherdel, a 16-game winner for the season. Catching him is Bob O'Farrell. And now, la dies and gentlemen, the first game of the 1926 World Series is about to begin. And here comes the first pitch. Strike! Strike! Stay with it. You got the big one left. Strike three, you're out. You can hit him, Joe. That Pennock's gonna be a tough one to hit. This kid Lazzeri looks tougher to pitch to than Ruth or Gehrig. He really crowds that plate. I'd show him a lot of curve balls. Keep them low and outside. Might be a mistake to feed him a strike on the first pitch, too. Come on! I see what you mean. Five on the Cards will win me how much on tomorrow's game? Two hundred. That's good odds. Yeah, but 1,000-to-1 ain't no good when the Cards can't win. What do you want from me? The question in this second game is who's going to pitch for the Cardinals? Manager Rogers Hornsby hasn't yet ma de his choice. The Yanks'll murder anybody they put on the mound. You're so right. Batteries for St. Louis. Pitching, Grover Alexander. Catching, Bob O'Farrell. Alexander! What are you doing, Hornsby, throwing the series? Brother, we can't help but win. Alex's record for the Cards has been nine wins and seven losses. He's an experienced, smart pitcher, but it's going to take a lot of arm to hold off Ruth, Gehrig and company. "Murderers' row." Look who's gonna pitch. Why, he's a has-been. Why don't you go home? - I got my rights, lady. - Oh, sit down. Play ball! Ball! Look him over, Combs. He'll walk you. You bet he will. What'd I tell you, lady? He's a has-been. Runner safe. Two more, baby. Come on, Babe, send this guy back to the breadline. You said it. - That's a boy, Alex. Come on, Alex. - Attaboy, Alex. Throw a curve ball. You're out. It's a double play. What did I tell you? Come on. Strike! Here comes run number two for the Yankees, and Alexander is in trouble for the second time in this second inning. - Time. - Time. There goes Hornsby to talk to Alexander. It looks like the old warrior is all through. I was just wondering, Alex, why don't you and Walter Johnson and I go to North Dakota for our duck hunting this year? Yeah, if I ever get this ball game over with, Rog. No, no, Hornsby's leaving Alexander in the game. One man, and only one man only, is responsible for this victory. Alexander, the forgotten man of baseball. Alex the Great, cool and calm on the mound, set down the Bronx Bombers with only four hits. Even the mighty Babe Ruth failed to get a hit off the old master. Those who said Grover Cleveland Alexander was through can eat crow tonight. I wonder what crow tastes like? I should have bet that five. I could kill myself. That wouldn't be a bad idea. And so for St. Louis, at the end of the ninth, one run, one hit, no errors, one man left on base. We go into the last half of the ninth inning with St. Louis lea ding New York ten to two. It's the last chance for the Yankees, and a slim one it is. Grover Cleveland Alexander has pitched brilliantly, allowing only eight hits in eight full innings. Making his second appearance in this World Series, the old master has never once been in any real trouble, allowing only one run in the third, another in the sixth. - Attaboy. - Come on, Alex, you can do it. Come on, baby. Come on, boy. All right. Let's go, Alex. - Come on, Alex. - Come on, Al. Come on. And it's another double play, Hornsby to Thevenow to Bottomley. Two out, nobody on and Huggins is sending in a pinch hitter for Urban Shocker. All right, Alex. High one. All right. Get this hitter out, that's the idea. Strike! Attaboy! All right, Alex. Hard, now. Alex! Go ahead, Alex. You're out! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! And he's done it again. For the second time in this series, Grover Alexander has beaten the Yankees, beaten them down into the ground. Alex the Great has tied up the series, made it three and three. "It was a pure case of head and heart." That's you. "And the fans recognized it. "They responded with screams, applause and tears. "There has never been so loud, long and continuous a demonstration "in the history of baseball." I heard it. You don't hear much from the stands when you're out there. But I heard that one. Well, they all say the same thing. You, my dear, are the hero of the series. But from now until spring training next year, you're gonna be the laziest hero anybody's ever seen. Of course, I know that you wanna be out there tomorrow to watch your team win. Well, they wouldn't dare let you down after the way you've kept them in the series, would they? Anyway, I'm going to stay here and I'll get us all packed and check out of the hotel. Then when the game is over, you meet me at the Pennsylvania Station and we're off to Florida on our vacation. And I told Rog and Walter Johnson that if they want you as a partner this fall, they're gonna have to switch from duck hunting to deep sea fishing. - You must be so tired, Aimee. - Why should I be tired? I've pitched a lot of baseball this season. Couple of times there, today, I didn't think you'd be able to finish that game for me. Once in the fourth, again in the ninth, I felt one of those things coming on. I looked over at the box seats and there you were. You gave me the strength to fight it off. I've been stealing strength from you all season. Every game, every pitch. Without you there, I couldn't have done any of it. I know it, Aimee. Without you, I'm just half a man waiting to black out. God sure must think a lot of me to have given me you. Going, going, and it's gone. A towering home run into the right field bleachers. And the Bambino, the mighty Babe Ruth, is trotting around the bases. That gives the Yankees two runs. But St. Louis still leads three to two in the bottom of the sixth inning. Card pitcher, Jess Haines, really looked sick when he heard the Babe's bat connect with that one. If St. Louis can hold their one-run lead to the end, it'll be the biggest upset of any year. Both Jess Haines for the Cardinals and Waite Hoyt for the Yankees, have pitched brilliantly. Order, please. Hello, would you please send a boy to 382 for bags? - Right a way. - Thank you. Here's the pitch to Combs. It's a drive over Hornsby's head into short center field. Combs pulls up at first for the single. One out. Combs on second and the Babe at bat. Haines is walking Ruth. Hornsby's trying to set him up for a double play. Ball four and the Bambino goes to first with a free pass. Bob "Long" Meusel steps up to bat. Haines stretches, throws and Meusel hits to short stop Thevenow. Babe Ruth was forced out at second. But Hornsby's throw to Bottomley at first was too late. So we have Yankee runners on first and third. Two out and Lou Gehrig coming to the plate. Your husband pitched two great games, Mrs. Alexander. He certainly did, and we're out in front on this one. Three to two. Thank you. Come back and see us again. We will, thank you. Bye. And the pitch almost got a way from catcher O'Farrell. Taxi, please. Crowd watching that electric board has got the streets all jammed. You might have to take the subway, Mrs. Alexander. Oh, no. Ball four and the bases are loaded. This is a crucial moment, la dies and gentlemen. It may mean the series. Time. Time. And there goes Hornsby walking over to talk to Haines. - What's the matter? - Seem to be working up a blister. - Can't control the ball, huh? - No, it's making them pretty wild. Wonder who Hornsby's gonna put in to pitch now. Alex. - Rog says he wants you, Alex. - Me? Not again today. I'm not even warmed up. Well, he says he wants you. Tell him I'm on my way. He's coming. You must get me a taxi. I've got to get to the Yankee Stadium. The fans here are going mildly insane as the hero of yesterday's game, Grover Alexander, walks slowly in from the Cardinal bullpen. I'm sure that no pitcher in baseball history has ever walked into a more desperate situation. The Yankees have loaded the bases. Tony "Push-'em-Up" Lazzeri, the hard hitting, brilliant Yankee second baseman is at bat. A single can put the Yankees ahead and win the series for them. Well, Alex. Now, remember what Bill Killefer said. He said, "As long as Alex can stand on his two feet, "he's still the pitcher I'd want to have in there "when we're in a tough spot." Well, you can see how things are. What do you think you can do with Lazzeri? Well, there don't seem to be any room left on the bases for him. Warm up as long as you like. I'll stall for time. - Come on, Alex! - Come on! Can't you go any faster? I'm sorry, Mrs. Alexander, the traffic's pretty heavy. Could be, could be... Foul ball! Ball one! Take it easy. Take your time, boy. - Ball! - Pour it up, Alex, come on. Alexander is wild. He's run the count of three and one on Lazzeri. Another ball and he'll walk in the tying run. Come on, Alex. Stay with him, boy. Come on, Alex! Strike! Can you go faster, please? I sure can, ma'am. - All right, take it away. - Now's the time, Alex. Go, boy. Come on, Alex. - Strike three! - Attaboy! Just listen to that crowd. If baseball fans ever had reason to cheer, Alexander just gave it to them. Striking out Tony Lazzeri in the last of the seventh with the bases loaded. There are two more innings to go. Can Alex hold off this now-desperate New York team that needs only one more run to tie up the ball game? Hey, Officer, what happened in the seventh? Alexander struck out Lazzeri with the bags loaded. Hot diggety! This is Mrs. Alexander in back. - Well, how do you do? - We've got to get to the stadium. Well, get going. Last half of the ninth. If Alexander can hold off the Yankees for three more outs, he'll be the greatest hero in World Series history. That's it! We hold them now, we win the series. Let's go! You all right, Alex? Yeah. - Sure been a pleasure, ma'am. - Thanks. - Is Alex still pitching? - Yes, ma'am. Strike! You're out! Two away, Alex. One more and we can start our vacation. Strike! Strike! Strike three!
