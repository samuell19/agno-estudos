His Excellence, the President Count Taafe is here. I've been waiting five minutes for you. -My apologies, Your Majesty, I was-- -Enough! I'm listening. Everything is in place for the wedding. -The procession, cars, reception, police. -What else? I must bring to your attention the unacceptable protests being carried out by the students. -The protests continue? -They're getting more and more violent. I'd like to highlight in particular the campaign that Mr. Seps has been promoting in his notorious liberal newspaper. He pushes the limits but never oversteps. To take action against him, we'll have to act outside of the law. I have reason to believe he's supported by people in high places. What do you mean? Be more specific! It's just the impression I have but… I believe Mr. Seps frequents the royal palace and has been seen around the Prince's quarters. -Albert! -Your Majesty? These croissants taste different. Did I ask you to change the supplier? My apologies, Your Majesty. The baker is currently unwell. Well his croissants are inedible. My subjects don't suffer from illnesses. You were saying? We were talking about Mr. Seps. About his visits. No, unless my memory fails me, we were talking about the students. What will you do? Your Majesty, I believe we must use force. Force equals respect. Passport, quick! What's your nationality? -Czech. -Croatian. There are no Czechs nor Croatians here! Only loyal subjects of His Majesty. Subjects, yes. Loyal, no. -Perhaps if you'd accept our passports… -Out, out! Come on! Send in the next ten! Next ten! Silence! Take off your hats. -Papers. -H… Here you are, Chief. I went the the court but I had no idea… -All right. Let him go. -Thank you. Next! Seps? Director of Vienna News? How did you get mixed up in this? I was simply out walking. We'll need you to give information to our officers. Sign the form, please. Next! Papers. -I don't have any. -Name? Rodolphe. -What? -Rodolphe. Yes, but Rodolphe what? -Rodolphe of Habsburg. -Pardon? Rodolphe of Habsburg? The Archduke? But Sire… The heir to the Austrian throne and Mr. Seps… arrested in a police raid. So you and that crook are united on the side of the masses. Your friends are destroying the monarchy! They want to ruin the empire. -You, the emperor's son. -Spare me, father, I know what I'm doing. To rule my people, I must know them. I'm learning by listening. That's what your ministers are for! There are secretaries, ministers, police… It's not acceptable for you to spend the night before your wedding with Seps. You should be with your fiancée. Please, father. You're the one who wanted this marriage to happen. For the sake of the crown and for your own happiness! Unfortunately, the two are irreconcilable. My mother has always known this. -Does she complain? -No, and neither do I. I've accepted Stephanie, but don't expect me to play happy family. Rodolphe… Is there already another woman in your life? One? I have ten! One hundred! As many as I want, and some I don't. But let's not speak of that. I'll marry the princess, I'll have an heir, the wishes of the state will be fulfilled. Don't ask any more of me. What a wonderful performance. Nobody can escape their destiny, my son. May God bring you closer together in time. May God ensure I never find true love. I'm soaked to the bone! The more it rains outside, the more fun they have inside. What a dreadful job! But what an honor to serve His Highness. Look! A customer. -It's Count Hoyence. Is he getting out? -Yes, they're always together. Like you and I! And who's that? That's the Colonel of the Fourth Hussars, Baron Grabet. Wait, let me write that down. Next page, it's past midnight. Is it the tenth? -Fancy that! -What? -It's May 10th. -So? They were getting married five years ago. That's right, five years to the day. If I weren't at home for my fifth wedding anniversary, Mimi would have my guts for garters! Is it going to rain all night? It'll stop when they're finished up there. Are you tired, Sire? I'm bored to tears, Joseph. Sire! A toast! -It's your wedding anniversary, Sire. -Thank you, Joseph! Gentlemen! It's my wedding anniversary. Let's have a toast. To the happy couple! Won't you drink to my happiness? To Their Royal Highnesses! To Their Royal Highnesses! Marinka! Won't you sing to celebrate this? Your wish is my command, Sire. Joseph… -Isn't Seps here? -Not yet. Thank you. As always, he's with Hoyence, Prince Philip and the others. -And Marinka? -She's there, too. My agents have informed me. -Seps isn't there? -No. -Is he due to attend? -Certainly. Seps doesn't yet have the documents for the article coming out tomorrow. Our agents haven't left his side. So he hasn't seen the Archduke yet. I need proof of their complicity. I need those papers, whatever the cost. Don't worry, Your Excellence. They may be smart, but I'm good at my job. Why do I love you? I love your eyes I love your smile I love your dulcet tones But not you What do I love you for? For a supper together? For your money? For your mean ways? For the prestige of your name? Well then No Why… Do I love you? You'll never know Do I even know myself? I just do Why do I love you? It's none of your business The beautiful oblivion Is here in my arms Marinka! You must be dreaming… of me, I hope. You'll leave me soon. Who knows? Have faith in destiny. I have faith in you. -She's jealous. -It's her gypsy blood. She's crazy about you. Crazy indeed. -Well? -He's not here yet. The second he arrives, I need to know. -Do I make myself clear? -Are you going to stay? I'll stay as long as it takes. I want to catch Seps myself. -Understood. -I must congratulate you, Marinka. You sing well, especially for the police. You say you're a romantic but you're also very obliging. Gypsy of the Police, that's what your next show should be. With this gentlemen as the conductor. Who sent you? -Your Highness-- -Highness? Am I heir to the throne or a criminal? A thief? A criminal? Who sent you? -Speak. Speak! -Sire… -I beg you… -You're afraid of the council. It's Taafe who sent you, isn't it? Sire… You can't even admit it. You're shaking. You disgust me. Oh, Marinka. Take the money you sold me to them for. Last night's events exhausted my patience. -Forget about that. -I've had enough, I want to leave. I'm tired of being constantly monitored. I'm sure the police are following us. Finally, he's sitting down! We can have a rest. It's no fun walking with all these cars. These kinds of places are the only distraction I have left. -What about women? -They disgust and annoy me. They all want something from me. That's tough. Their husbands even push them into my bed. Cheers, Sire. -What about your daughter, Seps? -My daughter? Why not? She's young, beautiful… Too young! But she's not your type. She wears glasses, she has chubby ankles… I was only joking. Seps, look! She's beautiful! Wait here. -All alone at the party, sweetheart? -No. Don't be scared, I'm a nice guy. Stop bothering that lady. I thought she was alone, that she'd be happy-- This young lady is with me. Of course! I thought… Please excuse me. My apologies, miss. What made you do that? You don't know me. You lied. A little lie is better than gross insolence. Yes, he was horrible. -See? -Thank you. No, you don't have to thank me. You're very young to be walking alone in the crowd. I never go walking alone. I was with my mother, sister and cousin. But I lost them in the crowd. Let's find them together. Together? If you want. It's funny… I feel as if I know you. Yes? Against my father's wishes, I came to you, my Prince. -Oh my darling! -Oh my sweetheart! I'm going to put on my silver armor. What for? I'm going to tell the King about our love. -God bless you. -God bless our love. Oh God! Oh! Who is this dreadful man? I'm the devil! I've come to get you. -What for? -You will burn! Roast! Boil! Devil! Don't take me, I was going to be so happy! The happy are the damned. -Sir, I beg you! -No! That's so sad! She was in love, and she was punished for it. Why? That's not fair. No, it isn't. I can't think who you remind me of. -Aren't they beautiful? -That one looks like you. -If only! -I'm going to give it a try. -Give me the rings. -Oh yes, try! That'll be twenty pence. -You'll never do it! -Just wait! Missed! Missed again! One ring! -Well done! -Marvelous! Sir! You've won a bar of nougat. Oh, thank you! Lucky me. Here. Let's share it equally. -Here you are. -I love nougat. Oh! There's my mother. She mustn't see me with a stranger. Stay a while! She hasn't seen us. No, its not a good idea. Goodbye, and thank you! -I know who you remind me of! -Who? Archduke Rodolphe. -I realized just as you looked away. -Does that bother you? No, not at all. Goodbye! Since when have you liked nougat, Sire? Nougat? Ah! Yes. Sir, you must have gone to bed late again. It's not my fault. I get so bored during the day I find distractions in the evening. I know, Sire. Life isn't all fun and games. Your voice sounds strange. Do you have news for me? I saw Mr. Seps this morning. And you didn't ask him inside? You were sleeping. His paper has been shut down following a police raid. He's been arrested? He was able to escape. He said to tell Your Highness not to worry about him. How dare they? This time they've gone too far. Come in. -What is it? -His Excellence, Count Taafe. -His Highness is not ready. -Tell him to come in. Didn't you hear? Tell him to come in. His Highness is in the bathroom. Good morning, Your Highness. To what do I owe the honor? I wanted to come early because I want to be the first to warn you, in person, about the measures His Majesty has taken against Seps. -His paper-- -I know. You have good informants, Your Highness. It's a shame. I wanted to express my sincere condolences. Don't use words if you don't know their meaning. Your Highness, you are being unfair. I was in fact proposing we come to an agreement in the interests of this country. Is that why you're spying on me, too? I simply want to ensure your protection, Your Highness. Against whom? I only need protection from you. Listen carefully, Taafe. I demand that Seps' paper be reinstated immediately. -And that he be left in peace. -But Sire! -Only His Majesty-- -It's not His Majesty, this is your doing! -May I explain? -Tell me. Are you going to do as I say? -I can't. -My tunic! Will you or not? -You know as well as I do. I can't. -Well see about that. The prince seems nervous. Must be a lack of sleep. His Highness sleeps very well, Your Excellence. Lochek, you know him better than I do. Do you think I should wait for him? I don't think so, Your Excellence. -I must speak to His Majesty immediately. -Yes, Sire. -The Archduke seems anxious today. -He's a nervous type, like his mother. I don't know how such a nervous man can be such a dreamer. -Sire. -I'm in a hurry. The thing is… His Majesty is too busy at the moment. Pardon? His Majesty will see you in 48 hours. You're saying he has no free slots for 48 hours? I can't see my father? He doesn't have time for 48 hours. Not even for me. His son. -Sire… -Lochek, we must put a stop to this. I can't do this anymore, it's killing me. But what does it matter, when this is what my life is like? I can't go where I want, see who I want. Trapped in this uniform since the age of eight. This has to stop, my friend. I ask to see my father, his aide answers for him. It's all just intrigue and duplicity. Enough! Sire… My poor Prince. Don't be upset. -How I wish-- -If only I had someone to turn to. Someone outside all this politics and betrayal who would accept me for who I am. A human being. I need someone. Tell me, Am I not a man like any other? Can't I be happy? Tell me, Lochek. Sorry, I'm going crazy. I know you can't do anything about it. No one can. Not even me. What now? His Majesty requests your presence at an Opera Gala. The whole court will be there. His Majesty is counting on you to be there, too. A gala? The whole court? I've found the answer, Lochek. A party at the Opera! Princess Stephanie is with the Emperor. As usual. And the Archduke. Who are you smiling at, Edwige? The Archduke's cousin. They call him the rattlesnake, the most dangerous of all. Edwige's teeth are as artificial as her pearls. What a wonderful space! Oh! A new girl. Do you see? In the third box on the left? The one in white? That's Baron Vetsera's daughter. She's with her brother, the lieutenant. If that girl doesn't have future plans I'd like to help her make some. Marie, you can sit down now. Georges, see that officer over there? It's Archduke Rodolphe. Hello everyone! I just wanted to say hello before the curtain goes up! What a beautiful dress, as always. Hello Georges, hello Anna. Your little cousin is here! And Marie, you're a grown woman now. You've been hiding her away! It's good to be private. But she's simply adorable! She absolutely must come to my next reception. Don't you think, Marie? -Answer, Marie! -What are you dreaming about? Oh, the curtain's coming up, I must dash! What about me, Countess? What about you? Of course you can come, I never forget anyone. -Thank you! -Goodbye. Was it good? Yes, wonderful. What's her name? Who's that? The dancer. I don't know. -Georges? -Yes mother? Come with me to Princess Emily's box. Wait here. Look, look! Lachratt is with the Emperor! Right there in his box. Who is Lachratt? Let's see, do you remember la Pompadour? Imagine the Emperor is Louis XV. Anna! The Archduke is greeting Mrs. Bishop. Now he's moved on to Mrs. de Langeais. -Apparently he's been seeing both of them! -And a gypsy, too. Like all men. If the Balkans question were not implicated in the Turkish solution, nor connected to the issues in Saint Petersburg… Who knows… Who's the young lady in box six? Isn't she beautiful? This must be her first outing. I've never seen her before. That is the youngest daughter of Baroness Vetsera. I've heard of her. Marie Vetsera. Did you say Vetsera? I'd really like to hear your opinion on the matter. Of course. Your Majesty. Madam, I saw you perform yesterday. You were wonderful. More wonderful than ever. Good evening, Count. All is well I hope? Good evening, dear cousin! Your Excellence. Are you taking care of state affairs? Oh no, not tonight. Are you alone in Vienna? Whatever for? I'm like you, I have a taste for solitude. There you are, cousin! You've become as rare as your father's smiles. It's been forever since I saw you. I feel like you aren't paying attention. Are you even listening to me? I'm here to do you a favor. One that'll make you look generous. Ask whatever you like, cousin. I don't want to insist. I just wanted to talk to you about Vetsera's youngest son. -Vetsera, you say? -Yes, cousin. His only wish is to be part of your regiment. Vetera, Vetsera… Was there an Ambassador Vetsera in Constantinople? Precisely. You have a good memory, Your Highness. And does this Vetsera have a son? A son and a daughter. You're incorrigible. So when can he visit you, Your Highness? Children, there are crowds everywhere! I thought I would never return. Guess what, governess? She was spinning on the tips of her toes! Turning faster and faster! But he wasn't watching her. He was looking at our box. -Listen, governess! -I'm listening! It was so beautiful. The lights, the music, the jewellery! -And it was all for him. -Who? For the Prince, of course. The one who caught a swan for me. I think he recognized me. The theatre has got you all excited. Now it's time to sleep. Sleep? I'll never be able to sleep again. You know… he's so handsome. There's such sadness in his eyes. But he has the sweetest smile. I could think about him for a lifetime. Please listen to me, madam. Don't be afraid, don't move. -It's you. -I know, I shouldn't be here. I had to see you and this was the only way. Please, sir… Marie. I couldn't resist. I've been thinking of you since we met. Sire… I barely know you, yet you can't imagine the joy you bring me. Joy, but also confusion and torment. One moment. I must see you again. I simply must. I beg you. But I'm never alone. -I really must see you. -Me, Sire? You needn't use the title. -But I told you, there's no way. -Anything is possible. There's my governess. Goodbye! Where were you? I was waiting for you. Do you think a prince can be unhappy? Anyone can be unhappy, Marie. Marie, you've been playing the same piece for two days! But it's so beautiful, Mother. -Is the Baroness here? -Yes, Countess. Hello! Hello, dear friend. Please, don't get up. Carry on. I love that music. I don't know how to thank you. My son was deliriously happy. It's a great honor for our family. Don't mention it. -Take a seat. -No, thank you. Walking prevents bloating. May I? Speaking of bloating, have you seen the Marquess? She's getting fatter by the minute! I mustn't eat them all, they're delicious. At the Opera, she looked like a big fat heifer. Sadly, no-one noticed. They were looking at your daughter. What a success she was! Everyone was asking about her. You're going to make her vain! Not Marie. Play loudly and listen to me. Princess Coralie, she's vain. But she'll have to work harder with those genes! My cousin wants to see you. Don't look worried. It's enough that she burdens us with her ancestry! Keep your composure. Don't stop playing. Once, she killed a butterfly just by breathing! Rodolphe spoke to me about you for an hour. He's enamoured. Play louder! Princess Ursula asked me to invite you to hers next Saturday. I'd be delighted. Marie! Don't play so loudly. Your compliments have thrown her off. Even the prettiest can't resist a compliment. Do you like this dress? Isn't it original? It's from a little couturier I found. Elegant like the ones in Paris. Oh, it's six o'clock already! I have to go. I have a fitting to go to. But I must ask you something. -Promise you won't refuse. -Anything you like! I must borrow Marie for an hour. She has such good taste. It'll be good to have a second opinion, and I get so bored being alone! -Would that be okay? -Of course, Countess. Come along Marie, go and get ready! Yes, Countess. She's stunning. -Goodbye! See you soon! -Yes. Don't worry, the coachman is loyal to Rodolphe like a dog. No one will see you at the palace. You'll be meeting in the most secret spot. Look at me. You're not wearing any powder! Or at least not enough. That's better. It brings out your eyes. Lower them occasionally, then when he sees them again, he'll be blown away. Show a little more forehead. There! You don't mind me telling you all this? At your age, you don't know how to make yourself look good. -Thank you. -What have I done? Aren't you happy? I'm so happy. I still don't believe he really… That he really wants to see me. I want to be left alone for one hour. -A new one, Sire? -That's right. An actress? A married woman? No. A virgin. Really? So they say. Don't worry about her virtue, she's a girl of her era. I saw her once, I told her all the same old stories and now she's coming here. -Look! The coach. -A little something for the Prince. -I recognize the Countess, but the girl? -I don't know. She must be new. We have to find out her name. I'll be back in one hour. Please follow me, miss. This way. There you are, Marie. Am I late? No, but up until the last minute, I didn't think you would come. -I thought you'd be afraid. -Afraid of what? Afraid of the palace, this dreary room… Afraid of me. Afraid of you? On the contrary. When I'm with you I'm never afraid. Oh, how awful! Is it always there? What for? To console me about my existence. Console you? But life is so beautiful. I'm talking nonsense. You're right. Will you take off your hat? But where will I put it? There isn't any space. There is next door. Is this where you sleep? I thought a Prince's bed would be-- It's enough for me. I sleep so little. The mirror is here on the left. My hair is a mess. How could you like me like this? I like you too much. I'm so happy. What is it? What's the matter? Come. You can't stay here. I don't know why you're here. No one has ever spoken to me in the way you do. Is there something you want from me? What do you mean? Usually those who come to me want something from me. What about you? Think about it. Is there nothing you want? But I have everything I want. Yes, Lochek. Don't worry, it's just a warning. We must part. Promise me you'll come back? You don't know what you mean to me, how much good you do me. I feel years younger. And what years I've lived through… Now go, quickly! The last meeting was Friday. -In the evening between 6 and 7. -At the palace? -As always. -This time it's serious. It's getting out of hand. The girl is from a good family, it'll create a scandal. We must put an end to this. -Without making any fuss. -I'll take care of it, Your Excellence. -How? -I have experience in these matters. For the attention of Baroness Vetsera. Dear Baroness, "Dear Baroness," A person… "A person…" …who wants the best… "…who wants the best…" …for your honorable family… "…your honorable family…" …feels it necessary to tell you… "…necessary to tell you" that your honorable daughter, Marie, has, for several weeks… Good evening, my love! Did I scare you? -You mustn't have heard me coming. -You're cold. I'm soaked up to my ankles! I had to find an excuse to not go with Mother. A reason not to be imprisoned in that theater when we have two hours to ourselves. It's the longest we've ever had! -What is it? -Look over there. Those are branches, not policemen. They don't know where you are. They've gotten better at hiding. They're always following me. Forget them. I love you. They'll never let it go. -They want to come between us. -But can they, darling? You have so much faith, so much courage. -I love you and we have two hours. -Two hours! Such short, infrequent meetings… Constant separation… I'm in love for the first time. Why must I hide it? Two hours. I want to spend my entire life with you. -Mother… -Where were you? I… I just wanted to-- I want to know where you were! -Mother-- -You should be ashamed. -Now I know why you didn't want to go! -Listen! I didn't want to believe the letter. But I can see from your face it's true. -But listen-- -Don't lie to me! I'm not going to lie to you. So it's true? Can it be true that you have a lover? Who is he? Mother, please don't talk like that. I swear on his life, we haven't done anything wrong. -He respects me. He loves me. -What's his name? I can't tell you. I'm your mother, I need to know. Please… -No, I won't tell you. -Be careful, Marie. -I can make you tell me. -Don't threaten me. Seeing as you won't talk, I'm sending you to Trieste tomorrow. You'll stay there for six weeks with your uncle, until you're cured of this madness. Mother! Mother! Do whatever you like, but please let me stay in Vienna! Mother! Mother… What are you doing here? -What's happened? Is Marie sick? -Let me catch my breath! She's left. An anonymous letter was sent. Marie didn't breathe a word to anyone. Her mother is incensed. She's sending her to stay with her uncle near Trieste. -Trieste? -Trieste. Don't make that face. It's only for a month. A month? A month without her? You don't understand. I have to go back to my old life. Alone again. Alone against all of them. They're good at their jobs, all right. At 00:12 he went to Sakev's. He came back in a rather delicate condition around three o'clock. At 3:15 a.m., he went to Alcazar. Just like yesterday, and the day before. Like every day. For six weeks. He's been driven to despair since the girl went away. -Is he alone? -What do you mean? -Is he with other women? -A new woman each night. But even if it were the same every night, he wouldn't notice. His Highness has been drunk for six weeks. Leave me alone! Faster! Here! Oh no, my dress! Take it off! -I haven't seen him like this for a while. -He's out of practice. He's never here! Another bottle of rum! Set it on fire! Turn off all the lights! Let's drink to His Highness! Drink! What an ugly mug… Who? There. That's you, sweetie. Get out of my sight, do you understand? Out of my sight! You're not going to leave? Let's see about that. Take that! And that! And that! Excuse me. Your Highness. What? -A woman is asking for you downstairs. -Is she pretty? Very. Excellent. I'm going down! I'll use force to bring her back if I have to! What are you doing here? I came back today. I wanted to see you. I managed to escape from my house. I ran all the way here. Kiss me! Don't be crazy! They mustn't see you here. -Rodolphe… -Don't, I've had too much wine. Good God, you're bleeding! -Where? -There. It's Irma's lipstick. She's a prostitute. Yes, a prostitute! And I kissed her. I can if I want to. I'm still free. Of course, darling. Why did you come here? I was having fun. Why did you come here to bother me? Are you spying on me as well? Is Taafe paying you? What do you want? -I just wanted to see you. -So take a look. Take a good look. Aren't I handsome? Are you happy? Have you never seen a drunk man? Leave me in peace! I want to be left in peace. I'll drink all I want. And I'll sleep with every woman in Vienna! And there's nothing you can do about it. Don't look at me like that. Why aren't you saying anything? Don't I deserve an answer? Do I disgust you? Speak, for God's sake! Speak or you'll never see me again. My poor darling. You're suffering. I'm ashamed, Marie. Why, darling? I love you so much. How can you still love me? Please forgive me. I'm hurting so much. I know, I know. You don't. How could you? Marie… My little girl. Save me. I'm afraid I'm going mad. I'm afraid to be without you. What will I do tonight when you leave? I won't leave you. Marie. Don't I belong to you? My love. -Good evening! -Good evening. Tell me… Ah, thank you. If you need me, I'm here! Good. Soon, we won't have to hide anymore. I'll be free and we'll be together for the rest of our lives. Forever? But Rodolphe… -I wrote a letter to Rome. -What about your father? He'll have to accept the annulment. I can get it and I will get it. You'd do that for me? Listen, Rodolphe. Whatever happens, I could never be unhappy again. What's that? An engagement ring? It's beautiful. There's a date! 13 November. The night at Sakev's. There are letters, too. "U, I, L, T, D… D, U, P." "United in love, 'til death do us part." How beautiful. Thank you. -You have to put it on my finger. -Why? So we can make a wish. Thank you. What did you wish for? To die before you. -Guess who's here? -Who? The Archduke! Just over there. -He's here? -I swear! With a woman. -Did you recognize her? -No. -Can't you guess? -It's Vetsera, who else? -Who are you talking about? -You… Don't joke about my sister. I wasn't, my friend! My brother! Calm down, apologize. -You're not worthy to be an officer! -Who are you to judge? -Dishonoring a young woman! -Don't you shout at me! Take her out and come back for me. Yes Sire. Stop making a scene! -What's happening? -They're fighting! They're drunk! -Tomorrow at dawn! -Fine! -The fearless don't brag! -I'll kill you like a dog. Lieutenant Vetsera. I think you've had too much to drink. -Your Highness? -I don't need anyone to defend me. But I won't allow an officer to get involved in my business. Take ten days. Report to your colonel immediately. -Sire. -You're dismissed. Captain Schonberg. You'll come to my office tomorrow. I'm afraid my regiment may not be the right place for you. Let's not let two fools spoil the party! -Pour me a drink. -Look how handsome he is. -To the regiment! -To His Highness! Isn't anyone dancing? Conductor! Strike up a waltz. -A waltz, madam? -Oh, Sire! I won't forget this day for the rest of my life! Rodolphe, you must save Georges. I know him. He won't resign. He loves me, he'll want to know the truth. He'll fight. He'll be injured or killed! Calm down, I'll speak to him. I promise. May I remind Your Highness, everyone is waiting for you. There are some people I have to see. It won't take more than an hour. Keep your coat on, there's a draft. If you catch cold, His Highness will never forgive me. That's kind of you. Me, kind? Don't be so sure. Lochek, where are you? -I was looking for you. -Your Majesty, I was with His Highness. -He has visitors. -Will he be long? Yes, there are four of them. -Tell him I was asking about his health. -He'll be delighted. I'll leave a note on his desk. Sorry to bother you, miss. You should have told me! I came to ask after my son. How is he doing? He seems tired, madam… Your Majesty. Poor Rodolphe. He isn't cut out for this life. I don't believe we've met? But I know he loves you. Take a seat. You're even more beautiful than they say you are. And so young! -How old are you? -Seventeen. Seventeen years old! At seventeen I was already unhappy. But I was young. So I didn't suffer too greatly. It'd be better to die young. Excuse me, I was thinking aloud about those who live in solitude. This is a sad palace we live in. Don't come back. May I kiss you? You are very dear to me. -Your Highness? -I need to speak to you. Do not partake in that duel. I must! He insulted my sister. -He told such lies! -Listen, Vetsera. -What if Schonberg was telling the truth? -What? I don't understand. It's impossible. Sit down, Georges. I'm asking you as a senior colleague, to listen calmly. Do you promise? Yes, Sire. I love Marie. More than anyone ever could. No one, except you. Before her, you couldn't possibly understand. She freed me with her joy, her youth, her love. Should I refuse it all? Think about it. Nothing belongs to me in this world. You must think my life is complete, like everyone else does. Or perhaps you think that because I'm the son of an emperor, I can't have the woman I love. Tell the truth. What do you think I should do? Georges, Marie is to be my wife. Soon everyone will know about it. As soon as I'm free I'm going to marry her. She knows. -Take my word for it. -I believe you, Sire. You're losing your mind! Making a spectacle of yourself. You're dragging our name through the dirt. And all for a girl. -That girl will soon be my wife. -I know. You've asked for permission to annul your marriage. This is what his Holiness replied. -About a personal matter? -The matter concerns me, too. You forgot about him. But he remembered. What did he reply? Negative! Of course it is. This is adultery. -Am I the only one? -No. Do what you want when you're in charge. Until then, end it with her. Impossible. -It's an order. -I won't obey. -How dare you? -I'm abdicating. You know very well that I would never, ever sacrifice her. You can't talk like that. You're not free. You owe it to all those who believe in you. Two nations, Rodolphe. Think of your honor. I love her. If you truly love her, you'll let her go. What do you mean? There are certain convents… -You wouldn't dare. -One way or another this affair will end. Think about it, father, I beg you. -I have. -This is my life. This is just a fling. -This fling is a matter of life or death. -End it, or she will go to a convent. There's another option. Meaning? Nothing of interest to you. Will you obey? If I can see her one more time. You'll see her tonight at the ball. I want to see her alone. Fine. You have 24 hours. After that, it's over. Do I have your word? Yes. Mother, do I look all right? You've asked ten times. You look like a fool, is all. Don't listen to her, Marie. She was just the same at her first ball. What's happening with the lovers? What lovers? I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. The Vetsera family at the ball! The Archduke has gone too far. -They should take their affair elsewhere! -Do you think she's that pretty? Everyone is at seventeen. The court! Where's the Empress? She doesn't come to galas anymore. What is it, Marie? The Archduke looks troubled. He's not happy. His Majesty told him to leave the girl. Would Your Highness do us the honor of opening the ball? -Must it be me? -If you please, Your Highness. If I please… Fine. It's about to start. The Archduke is coming our way! Would you do me the honor of opening the ball with me? -Your Majesty… -Remain calm. You're the Archduchess. Good evening, Sire. My love. Marie, you are so beautiful this evening. I'm just happy, that's all. Wait here. Your Highness, would you care to dance? How did I ever live without you? I didn't know anything, feel anything! I didn't exist. Thank you, Rodolphe. -Please, stop. -Why? Marie… What if I suddenly made you leave? -I would wait for you. -No, far away. Very far. For a very long time. -I would follow you! -What if it were impossible? Impossible? I would follow you anywhere. Even somewhere you could never come back from? With you, yes. See how he looks at her? -They're dancing too close! -How impertinent! Outrageous! You know what those three hags are saying about us? Ageing is an ugly process. Let me introduce you to my father. I want him to see you tonight. He's introducing her to the Emperor! Allow me to introduce Baroness Marie Vetsera. Your Majesty has sealed her fate. You are very beautiful, miss. Your youth will bring you hope. How kind, Your Majesty. You will win, Your Highness. They won't see each other again. The coachman will be waiting in the street as usual. He knows where to take you. Yes, Sire. My little Marie, what an honor! Who would have thought? -You should be proud. -Did the Emperor talk to you? What did he say? I don't know. What do you mean? I saw him talking to you, do you realize how lucky you are? Prioch, call the coachman. I need your help. Your Majesty, may I have your permission to leave? There's going to be a scandal. A scandal? Well it's nothing… to do with me! Curtsey! What's gotten into you? Thankfully she didn't notice. I need to leave Vienna within 24 hours. Arrange a hunt. I only want you and Phillip to attend. You can count on me, Sire. -See you tomorrow. -In Mayerling. In Mayerling. Madam, Miss. Marie! Leaving in the night like this! I should never have agreed to help. Don't worry and please don't scold me, not tonight. it's the best day of my life. It truly is. -Here we are. Good evening, Bradfich. -Good evening! Goodbye, dear governess. Wait! One more thing. Give this letter to mother. But after tomorrow. Marie, you're scaring me. You're not going to do anything bad? Bad? -On the contrary. -Do you promise? Everything I do will be good and just. I promise. Goodbye, governess. Marie! I'm coming! Watch out! Find a good hiding place. You're not hiding very well! -I wasn't ready! -I didn't know! -You cheated. -I would have found you anyway. I know Mayerling like the back of my hand. Mayerling… Mayerling… It sounds like the name of a fairytale. Are you cold, darling? No. -I have to ask you something. -Yes? Will you be the one to decide the moment when we… When we leave? It'll be easy. -A matter of seconds. -You don't need to reassure me. I just don't want to know. Do you promise? You won't know a thing. Don't worry my sweetheart. Let me guide you. Do something, immediately! My daughter disappeared last night! Might I recommend you go and speak to the police? -They'll begin an inquiry. -We've already been to the police. -They didn't do anything. -Your Excellence, now I… I've found out a few things I wasn't aware of yesterday. -I think the Archduke knows where she is. -He does know! Your Excellence, where is the Archduke? I would like to help but unfortunately I don't know exactly. The Prince is so capricious. But I believe he has gone hunting in Laksinbourg. Thank you, Your Excellence. Please excuse me. Hurry! 30 JANUARY 1889 -Are you missing your gypsies? -No, he plays well. -Who was it? -A letter from Vienna. His Majesty reminds you that you must be home by tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? -I replied on Your Highness' behalf. -Good. Don't go, Lochek. Nor you, Bradfich. Have a drink. Rodolphe, I like you tonight. It's the first time I've really liked you. That's comforting, Philip. Cheers, my friends. -To His Highness! -No, wait! I want to make a proper toast. A toast to the most beautiful and true love there ever was. I wish you health, happiness, and a long life together. What are you doing? Nothing, darling. I've finished now. I'm so happy here. But I can't keep my eyes open. Though I'd rather not sleep. Kiss me, Rodolphe. Kiss me all night. Sleep well. No, not yet! I'm afraid of the dark. I prefer the light. I wish I could see the sun coming up already. You will. Rodolphe. Do you remember the puppet show, the first time we met? Yes. Do you remember what the devil said? "The happy are the damned." See you tomorrow, my love. See you tomorrow. Yes, Lochek? Pardon me, I just thought I heard a gunshot. I didn't hear anything. It was probably in the forest. -What time is it? -Just after 7:30 a.m. I'll be down in an hour. Very well, Your Highness. My apologies for disturbing you. THE END Subtitle translation by: Holly James
