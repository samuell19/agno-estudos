(suspenseful music) - [Narrator] August 17th, 1945. Indonesia declares its independence. From a scattered, unallied group of over 300 islands, a single nation is born. For hundreds of years, the Indonesian islands had been occupied by the Dutch, who exploited both their resources and their people. Indonesian men and women fought side by side under a single leader until they finally gained their independence. This film tells the story of a village caught up in the struggle, and the heroes who rallied around the Indonesian battle cry, merdeka, a single word that means freedom. Merdeka! - [Crowd] Merdeka! (gong crashes) (airplane engines buzzing) (explosion booming) (people shouting) (dramatic music) (people chattering) (airplane engine buzzing) (explosion booming) (people shouting) - Move it, move it, move it. - Move it, take through. Hurry up there, come on, let's go, get going. - This way. (suspenseful music) (people chattering) (airplane engine buzzing) (explosion booms) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (explosion booms) (crying) - Mama, get up, Mama. Get up. Get up, Mama. (people chattering) - Don't panic, please. The Dutch are attacking. We must evacuate. Take your belongings and head south. Don't panic, please, do not panic. - Captain, we need you. - Yes. Prepare for battle. I'll come soon. - Yes si.r - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (banging) - Come on, grab 'em. - What should we do? - Go and fight. You'll be happy if you win, heroes if you lose. - We would like to have your blessing, for our safety. - Merdeka! - [Crowd] Merdeka! - Papa. I must go to fight. - All right. - Later. - Bye. - I'm gonna too. - You don't have to go. You stay right here. - Merdeka! - Get the chest-- - You must leave it behind. - No, I can't leave it behind. All of our possessions are in it. (whimpering) - Go with your parents. (gentle music) You must evacuate. Amir. - Captain. - Get the men together and be ready to move out. Do it now. - Captain. - Oh god. (crying) - I'll see you in Kadanjati. Please be very careful of yourself. I couldn't stand it if anything happened to you. (crying) - I'm not afraid. - I am not afraid. - I'm not afraid. - You're full of shit. (panting) - Merdeka. - Merdeka. Be quiet. What has happened? - They're coming. (gun clicks) (engines rumbling) (gun clicking) - Fire! - Fire. (explosion booming) - Blackened shrapnel. Now the shit's really gonna hit the fan. (suspenseful music) - Come on. Let's go. (gunshots banging) Come on. Let's go. (shouting) - Come on, come on! Let's go, let's get them outta here, come on! (suspenseful music) (shouting) (gunshots banging) (shouting) - Woo! (grunting) - Merdeka! Merdeka! Merdeka! (shouts) (shouting) - Shit, let's move! (man grunts) - Let's get him! (shouting) - I surrender. (grunts) (shouting) - Merdeka! - [Man] Retreat! - What the hell? (shouting) (gunshots banging) - Come on! - Wait, just 15 minutes and we'll have those dogs. Whoa woo! - Come on. In five minutes the bomber planes will be here. So shut up and move it, now! - Woo woo! (suspenseful music) (shouting and chattering) - Retreat, hurry. Let's move! - Hurry up, come on. (engine rumbling) (solemn music) - [Child] Mama! (people chattering) Mama! (crying) Mama? (crying) - Where's Captain Bondan? - You know, I told them not to evacuate, but they just wouldn't listen to me. - [Suchi] Papa, hi. - You decided to come back. You look fat in your divorce. - [Suchi] Papa, come on. (laughing) (airplane engine buzzing) (people shouting) (suspenseful music) (gunshots banging) (explosion booms) (gunshots banging) (explosion booming) (people chattering) (moaning) - Oh Papa! (talking drowned out by crowd chattering) - Oh my daughter! (crying) (solemn music) - Pick up the captain! - Anun. Anun. I hate them. Back to town. We're going back and fight! - Captain, you must think about the enemy. - No. No! I'm going to kill them all! - It won't bring your wife back. (dramatic music) - It wasn't so rough, was it? (laughing) - Sir, it's as simple as taking a virgin. - Yes, they have spirit, but what they don't have is experience. - Yeah, but the Japanese have made 'em great. - No, patriotism has done that for them. They're fighting the hard fight for their freedom. I know this, but they have nothing to support them except their courage. We have nothing to fear. I must say, I admire their guts, but the strongest army will win. - Yeah, and it'll be the Dutch. (engine rumbling) - I've looked at the factory and it's suitable for our headquarters. - All right then, we'll go there right away. Let's go now, move. - Over there. (baby crying) (goats bleating) (people chattering) (woman crying) - [Woman] Hush now. It's the will of God. Shh. - [Woman] This is our rice though. We can't possibly sow any more. - It's for the kids and you that I'm giving this rice. With this to help them, freedom fighters will be strong. (woman crying) - Captain. My home and my equipment are yours to use. Please, be my guest. In the back, you can set up a kitchen. - Yeah. Thanks a lot. I'll do that. (birds chirping) - Breek. - Yeah. - Come on, I smell the police. - But I can't get the cabinet unlocked. - [Man] Screw it. - Come on, you guys, let's go! Which way? - Behind the back. (grunts) (gasps) The soldiers! (panting) - [Breek] Oh shit, what now? - Shh. Hold this. Dear God, I promise to be a good boy if you'll just save me from these goddamn farmers. (spitting) Here, okay. (crunches) (grunts) Shh. - [Man] Ah, don't pull it out! - All right, I'm shooting if you don't come out! - You ass! (gunshots banging) All right, okay! You win! (grunts) Come on. - Go on, against the wall. Stop moving, okay. - Hey. - Revolutionaries, huh? Where are your headquarters? - I'm a humble robber. - [Soldier] Liar! Jakob, check 'em out. - [Jakob] Right. - Now you talk, or I'll make you bleed! - Mama was right. I'm a fool. I promise I'll never rob again, don't make me bleed. - [Jakob] Shut up! (soldiers muttering) - Run for it! (panting) (gunshots banging) (shouting) (grunting) (gunshots banging) (gun clicks) (gagging) (solemn music) (groans) - Jabar. Please. Don't go without me. - Breek. - [Breek] Please, carry me. (grunting) - [Jabar] Okay, hold on tight now. I've gotcha. - You know the bombs have destroyed my land. My village has been burnt, our leader captured by the Dutch. You want me to stay on as a guerrilla? All right. God knows I have nothing left to lose. - Yeah, yes, they are always victorious, over our dead bodies. - I'm sorry this is happening, but it gives us the will to fight. - Yeah. And our time can't be wasted. That's why we need a plan. Our only hope is to reoccupy the town. That will give us a local headquarters for the resistance. Any other messages from the colonel? - Only one. Your orders are to take your battalion to the north. The ammunition depot has to be destroyed. You must do everything in your power to drive them out of your town. - Yes, now you must show the world that the republic will never die. (birds chirping) - Who's that? - One of ours? - No way. I know him. Jabar. That guy's a criminal. - Hmm. - Surround him. Hands up, stop! - What's going on here? I came here to join you. - That's what you say. Why you got all those guns, then? - Wouldn't you like to have them? I brought them as a present for you. - Really?! - Yeah! Help me, these rifles are heavy. - [Soldier] Take the guns. (men chattering) - [Soldier] Look at this one. (grunting) - [Soldier] Look at the action on this one. (gun clicks) - Huh? - All right, put your hands up. You, move! (gunshots banging) (shouting) Do you wanna get blown away? - [Soldier] No, no. - Then I want you to put those weapons on the ground. - [Soldier] Yeah. (grunts) (gasps) - All right. Get your leader. Tell him that I'm impatient. Come on! You know that I lost three friends getting you these guns. Huh? Three friends! But that's not the worst part of it. My best friend Jabreek is lying over there bleeding. Here's something to think about. When that happened, I didn't stand around and cry. No, I killed the enemy and stole their guns. What do you say? - Hmm? - Huh? Good work, huh? - [Soldier] Oh yes, real good work. - [Jabar] So you see what a hero I am. - How can I help you? - Commandant? - Yes. - The name is Jabar. You can see I am only a humble thief and robber. I'd like to be able to join your army. I brought presents, plus put away four Dutch. - That's good. But about your gun. I'd put it away. You see, that's how you can prove you're with us. - Ooh, I am, it's true, he'll tell you. (groans) (solemn music) Jabreek? Jabreek? Jabreek. Breek. Jabreek. Jabreek. (crying) Jabreek is gone. Jabreek is gone! - Should we take him? - Yeah. - Jabreek did not deserve to die this way. He wasn't a soldier. And I am only a thief, but I will tell you, or him, or anyone else. Commander, I will fight for you. You must give me the chance to pay them back! (sighs) - Okay. We'll let you join with us. But you better keep yourself outta trouble. Now you listen to me. Before you came to us, you were a lousy criminal. But you answer to me now. And if you get too far out of line, you'll be shot dead and left to rot. (gulps) - Yes Commander. - You can bury your friend now. - Thank you. - Kun. (grunts) Help him out. And if you're hungry, Jabar, the kitchen's in back. - Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. (soldiers muttering) - [Soldiers] Yeah, he'll be okay. Feel sorry for the friend. (soldiers muttering) (chicken clucking) - Hello. (grunts) - Well, hey, look what you've got for me. - For you? Only the best. You know, he begged me to bring him here. (laughing) Paimo, come here. - Yes sir. - Take this, will you? And so. - Yes. (chuckles) - Now, this is a good value. Now look at that, it's too much. Now look at that, that's class. (chickens clucking) (goats bleating) - I'm starving. - [Latifah] I'm Latifah. The food isn't ready yet. - Bondan said such nice things about you. And I'm kinda hungry, huh? - We're too busy cooking. You'll just have to wait. (chuckles) Nobody's gonna wanna help you if you don't have manners. Now just step back and wait. (scoffs) - Maybe I should teach you a lesson. I'm a hungry man, I wanna eat. Hey, Jabar's the name, and I take my orders from the Commandant. I'm a killer, and I dare anyone to take me on. Anyone. - No, if you want food, you're going to have to wait. And I'm not putting up with any more! - God damn. I'll show you. (grunting) - Try it. Go on. Get up and try it, fool. (chuckles) - There. I'm a good boy now. - All right. Now let's settle this problem. Come on. Come on, you stupid two-bit thief. I'm sick of you mouthing off. Come on! (people chattering) (grunting) - This is a good chance to make a bet. I'll go with the lieutenant. How about you? - It's all right, I don't wanna take the risk. (people shouting) - Come on, hit me. Come on. (people gasping) Come on. (grunts) (people groaning) (people chattering) (gun clicks) (gunshot bangs) - [Man] Huh? - Your lunch is ready. (people chattering) - Come on and eat. - Eat? - I'll finish you later. - Here, drink this. (gentle music) - Thanks. - Here it is. If you'd just waited, then this would never have happened to you. (laughs) - I felt a lot better. And I'm sorry about what happened. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you, here, take that. Thank you, thank you very much. - Food please. - Here. - Thanks. - Hey. (goat bleating) - So. I'm sure the Dutch will take our bait and attack us here in the south. If they do attack, Sergeant Gintin will stop them near the hills. Most importantly, we must get all the information we can about Dutch headquarters. Top priority. I need every man's commitment. - Okay. Sergeant, William, Copagani. - Yes sir. - [Lieutenant] All right. Let's go. - [Soldiers] Yes sir. - Good luck, sir. - Lieutenant. - [Lieutenant] Yes sir. - You're fighting for your freedom. - [Lieutenant] Merdeka. (chattering and laughing) - Gimme a drink. - You want some more? - Gimme a kiss. (laughing) - Here. - Come on. (breathing heavily) - This way. - Okay? (murmurs) (chattering and laughing) (shouts) (groaning) (body thuds) - Ludwig. Ludwig! (shouting) (body thuds) (gasping) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (grunting) (gasping) (engine rumbling) (gunshots banging) (groans) (engine rumbling) - Stop! Stop the damn car or I'll shoot! (gunshot bangs) (grunts) (whistling) Come on! (engine rumbling) - Merdeka! (tense music) (whistling like a bird) (imitating bird cawing) - [Soldier] Hurry up. - [Soldier] How's it going? - Fine. Let's go. Yeah, now. Jono, everything's ready. - Yeah. (moans) - [Lieutenant] All right. This is it. (engines rumbling) (engines idling) - Lieutenant, you'd better check the bridge. - Oh, yes Major. Jack, Bob. Go and check the bridge. - Yes sir. - Yes sir. (tense music) (grunts) (gagging) - How is it, Bob? Okay? - It all looks good! - Forward, march! (gunshot bangs) (grunts) (gunshots banging) Attack! (gunshots banging) (explosion booming) (crashing) (gunshots banging) - Woo, woo! (shouting) (screams) (shouts) (gunshots banging) (laughing) - [Suchi] What's wrong? - I'm hit. Hmm? - Fight or I shoot you. - Okay. (grunts) - [Soldier] Lookout! (explosion booming) (gunshots banging) (grunting) (groans) (mumbling) - Please. This belongs to my wife Anna. - All right. Help me. Bastards. (gunshots banging) (grunting) - [Jabar] Latifah! Get down! (gentle music) (guns clicking) (gunshots banging) (shouting) - Let's get the hell outta here. - Order everyone to retreat. - Right, everyone retreat! (shouting and chattering) - Come on! - Help! Don't go! Help! Help me! Don't leave me! Connie. Don't leave me, don't! Help, don't leave me! Oh! - [Soldier] Put your hands up. (gunshots banging) (groans) (gun clicking) (gasps) - Put your gun down. Bring her along. (grunting) - Major, we can ambush them on the river road. There's a cable car by the rubber factory. It'll be easy, I know it. They can find a way. - [Major] Lieutenant, ambush those extremist pigs. - [Lieutenant] Yes Major. - Go on. Move it. - Come on. Come on, you. - Come on, come on. (chattering) Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Not too many or it'll sink. Come on. Hurry up, go! Go! Come on, let's go. (engines idling) - [Soldier] Put your hands up. - Please, don't shoot me, please. - [Major] Bring back the cable car. - All right. - [Man] What's going on with this thing? I hope it's not broken. - [Woman] We're going back. (engines idling) - Come on, come on. - Come on, come on, everybody off. (chattering) All right, get in, get in now. Come on, come on, let's go. All right. (grunts) - Turn it on. - Yes, all right. (cable car creaking) - [Soldier] Come on, come on, let's go. Come on. (chattering) (cable car creaking) (water lapping) - [Soldier] Hey, there they are. (gunshots banging) - Hey, men! (shouting) (screams) (gunshots banging) (groans) - Lieutenant! Help, we're under fire! - Shit, son of a bitch. - Help, bring back the car! - Hurry up, bring it back. (grunts) (explosion booming) (splashing) (solemn music) (chattering) - [Children] Merdeka! - Come on. - [Child] Merdeka! - [Boy] Father. - [Children] Merdeka! - [Boy] Good to see you, Dad. Merdeka. You're okay, Dad. - [Child] Merdeka! - [Boy] Oh, Daddy. - Suchi. You had us so worried. Next time, don't go to war. - Yes, Suchi. (chattering) - Sir, where's my grandson? - Inron is dead. - He's dead? Inron was killed by the Dutch? - I'm very sorry, but when he died, he died a hero and not a coward. (woman crying) (chattering) - [Man] Oh, there you are. Papa's home. Missed you. - Mama, where's my daddy? - He'll come back. He'll come back. (solemn music) (chattering) - Sergeant Gunting left this for you. - We thank you. - Where's my papa? (crying) (gentle flute music) - Coffee, sir? - Latifah and Corporal Gani, what will happen to them? (sighs) - They would've been better off being killed. The goddamn Dutch will torture them. - [Jabar] I'd like to help them escape. It's hard. - What do you mean? - All my life I've been a lousy thief and I shoulda been in jail by now, or hanged. What do I do when I'm faced with danger and there's no money at stake? I'll tell you. I (laughs) will usually run away. But all that's changed now. Because I'm not going to have one more friend die at the hands of those Dutch pigs. (sighs) I've had enough of this war. But I'll keep on fighting as long as I have to. So what is the probability of being able to get them out, alive? - Poor. But since you couldn't manage it alone, I'll help you. We have ears in the Dutch camp. You must be patient till we hear. (fire crackling) (gentle flute music) (grunting) - Enough! (coughing) (groaning) Hmm. Bring me that girl, Latifah. - [Soldier] Yes sir. - Hendrick, drag in that girl right away. - Move. Come on! - Don't you treat me like that! I'm a prisoner of war, not a thief. - Go on. (water splashing) (tense music) - Look. (solemn music) - Put that extremist in the clinic. It's sad. I'd like to kill him. Sit down, won't you? Henrick. - [Henrick] Yes sir. (groans) - You're treating him worse than an animal. What kind of a man does that? - You know, a war can do terrible things to men's minds. Sometimes it makes us worse than the very devil himself. Your friend would not answer a simple question about your headquarters. Now it's your turn. I hope you will be more willing to cooperate with us. - You want me to tell you the location? - Yes. - How about this, if I tell you a lie, and all your men are ambushed. - Don't be silly. I also have spies. And if you have told me a lie, I'll have you shot dead in a minute. (scoffs) - Bastards don't care what they do, and I know you're that, so listen. You think I'll talk if you hurt my body? How little you know about our cause. (chuckles) - Your cause won't matter when you're screaming for mercy. Now, Latifah. There's no way to win. I don't want to hurt you. Give up and no pain will come. - Go to hell. - Lieutenant. - Yes Major. (grunts) (grunts) - Jakob. (grunts) (machine rattling) (grunts) Don't lie to us. Now if you tell us where they are, my wires won't give you any pain. Give up and tell us. Or I'll have to shock your pretty brains. (spits) Bitch! You think I like torturing women like that? I've had about enough of you. Do you think your friends care what's going to happen to you? No, they're sitting around at camp, drinking and laughing. They wrote you off when you were captured. (machine rattling) Now, tell me the location of your headquarters. - I won't! Go to hell! No! - Hmm. (match clicks) (machine rattling) (electricity buzzing) (gasping) (panting) (gasps) (electricity buzzing) - Lieutenant, that's enough for now. (panting) - Here, you. (moans) (sighs) - The Nazis did that to my sister before my very eyes. And like this girl, she didn't say a word. (sighs) (goat bleating) - No, I am sorry, no one is allowed to leave this place. The situation is dangerous, that's the commander's orders. - He's not my commander. He told me to evacuate. But I want to go back of my own free will now. - All right. So tell me what happens to us after you're captured. What will you say when they torture you? It's a big risk. - All I know is this. I want to go home. Like all of us. - No people can go back to the town yet. I bet you'd talk if they tortured you. - I'm not a traitor. (spits) Who's gonna be a traitor? This old merchant or somebody with Dutch blood? (gasps) You will talk. - [Suchi] William! - Yeah, I have Dutch blood. - Pa. - But I have more republic in my soul than you do. (goat bleating) - Oh. - I'm a freedom fighter, old man, and you can't talk to me like that. You do it again, and I'll blow you wide open. (chickens clucking) - [Suchi] Dad, I told you not to go back. - Your father's stubborn. (sighs) - Punk. (sighs) - I know the Dutch commander who has imprisoned you, and I can ask him to reduce your punishment, or even free you if you'll cooperate. Listen, you're not the only ones who want Indonesia to be free. It's not the right time for it yet. Someday we'll be free. But for the time being, the Dutch are just helping us to get on our feet, and when we're ready, independence will come naturally. - A beautiful package, Bandi. Loving tyrants and willing slaves. Do you think that I'm really that simple? Your people are dying, and you love the power of the Dutch, I see. (chuckles) - They're people too. - Yeah, and the problem is that these Dutch really think they're better people than me and you. Be glad we're fighting for you. - All right then. But I wouldn't be surprised if your dad has a different point of view. We'll see. - My father doesn't know anything! If you want answers, I'm the one to hurt! (crying) Bandi, leave my papa alone! Bastard dog! You're a traitor! A pig and a traitor! (crying) (children singing in foreign language) (engines rumbling) - [Child] What's going on? - [Child] I don't know, who are those men? - [Child] They look like soldiers. - Quiet, quiet. Calm down now. What do you want? (chuckles) - We caught your daughter. She's joined with the extremists. - She's old enough to decide for herself. What has this to do with me? - Hmm. Let's just say that we need your help. (children chattering) - Shh. - Oh my god. (solemn music) (engine revving) (gasping) - Don't cry. (boy crying) - Now Amin. Crying won't help it. God will take care of your papa and Latifah. - Amin, I want you to go to Kindong Jadi and give this to Captain Bondan, and be sure to keep yourself well hidden. - How will I get there? - I think your bike's the best way. - All right. - Don't worry, I'll take good care of her. - That's good. Ma, I'm gonna try. - Now we're gonna talk. You decrepit old bag of air. Old bastard, what's the matter with you? Pretending you didn't know about the guerrillas. But I want you to cut this ignorant crap and tell me where your headquarters is located now. - I can't tell you anything about that. I'm a teacher. You know I can't be held responsible for my daughter's actions. - Liar, liar, a damn liar, I'm tired of your shit! And I've got a little surprise for you. Because I know what you've been up to. (grunts) (dramatic music) - Oh, Dad. - Here you go. We brought you your papa. He came all this way to see you. Wake up, pig! (grunts) (shouting) Lieutenant. Get to work. (grunts) (clicking pliers) (shouting) - You beast, you cad! - Quiet down. Don't worry. Your father's not going to die. We'll pull the nails out one by one. Talk to us, or he'll suffer. - Me instead. Don't hurt Papa! He's innocent, please! (panting) He doesn't know anything. Do it to me! Do it to me. (Latifah crying) (grunts) Don't hurt him. Just let him be and I'll talk. - You'll what? - Oh, let him go. - Dear god, did I bring you up to be a traitor? No. No, my child. - Come on, talk to us now. Talk, and then we'll free you both. - Don't say anything. My life is unimportant! (shouts) Latifah. You're not my daughter if you betray our country. Help me with silence. (gunshot bangs) (shouting) - Oh my god. Pa. (Latifah crying) (clatters) (tense music) Papa. (crying) (grunts) - The munitions depot is only guarded on two sides. (goat bleating) Don't worry, Amin. I'll free your father and Latifah. - I hope so. Uncle Marsa said that there are Dutch soldiers and spies all over the place. Do you believe it? - Yes. But for them to bring their army in here would be very difficult. Our guards would see them. - [Suchi] Murderer! Murder! How could you kill him in cold blood?! - Inside. (chickens clucking) - Just because you're a patriot you think you can kill anyone you hate. Murder, murder! I hate you, stinking murderer! (Suchi crying) - What happened? Tell me! - He shot Father! Killed him in cold blood. He killed my father! - William? (Suchi crying) - I didn't mean to kill him, sir. It was an accident. Mr. Jufri was stubborn. He insisted on leaving the village, even though Lieutenant Haryono had forbidden him to go. (cart rattling) - Halt! Get down. Come on, hurry up. - Down. - Nico, go check the wagon. (grunts) Where you going? - We're going home, sir. We evacuated when the Dutch came. (shouting) - Mine! - Uh-huh, I'll bet. I know. You left with the militia. - No, listen to me. Jya, the baby, and I, we're on your side. - Hmm. You're lying, old man. Do you think I'm that stupid? Don't you pull that shit on me. - No. Really. I wouldn't lie about it. - Son of a bitch! - [Mrs. Jufri] Oh my god. - Nico, burn that wagon. Now. - [Nico] Yes sir. - No. It's true, listen to my husband. - Wait! (panting) I'll tell the truth, if you'll please spare us. - We can work something out. Now answer me, how many people in that village? - [Mr. Jufri] About 100. - Where's headquarters? Don't get quiet now, or I'll shoot you in the balls. All right now, tell me about it. - Yes, yes. It's in-- (shouting) (gunshots banging) (shouting) (gunshots banging) (Mrs. Jufri crying) - My god. (cow mooing) (sighs) - I'm sorry he's dead. (goat bleating) (chickens clucking) - Please forgive me, Suchi. - Suchi, we had to shoot them. - Murderers! (gasping) - Suchi! Here. Give it to me. - Murderers! (engines rumbling) (insects chirping) - Hmm. - Sit down, Miss. - Sit down. What is it, Bandi? - I've gone and checked the spot out, Major. Her father was killed by a group of extremist revolutionaries, and, well, she's here to talk. - Yes. But how can we trust you? You've been working with them, haven't you? Have some wine. - Mm-mm. - Lieutenant. - Yes sir. - Bring in Miss Latifah. (lock clicks) (gasps) (clapping) - Come on. Come on, get up. Hurry up, the major wants to see you. You, get her up. Get up. Come on. (grunts) (solemn music) - Latifah. - Now this young lady Suchi has a much better attitude. She has made it easy on herself and told us the few simple things we needed to know. Tonight my best men will move in around the town, and then at sunrise, destroy it. - Be damned, then! You're a traitor! - [Suchi] No, listen. - Take your hands off. I don't wanna me touched by a traitor. - Latifah, you don't understand. I didn't know. I was angry, 'cause they shot my dad. William didn't let him get out. They thought he was a traitor. And wouldn't you want to pay the butchers back? (crying) - How like you to play the stupid fool. What happens now is every mama and papa in the village will be killed because of you. You bitch! Traitor! - How could I know? All I saw was Papa shot dead by our own guns! - [Latifah] You've killed 100 innocent people! - Latifah, you know I asked Papa to join the forces. And it's my fault that now he's dead. I blamed all the others. - Suchi, do you only think of yourself? But one day ago, my papa died in front of my eyes for our secret! (both crying) (grunting) - [Bandi] Suchi. Don't. (gunshot bangs). (gunshot bangs) (gasping) - Merdeka. (dramatic music) (solemn music) - Clean up. Take her away. - [Soldier] Yes Major. - My feeling is she gave us the right information. - Yeah, but what if Suchi was just a decoy? - We attack tomorrow. - Hmm. (birds chirping and squawking) (exhales) - Come on. - God. The Dutch! Dutch soldiers have surrounded us! Help! The Dutch! The Dutch are attacking! The Dutch! The Dutch! (grunting) (chattering) (gunshots banging) (shouting) - Take the men to the village. Turn around, hurry. (solemn music) (explosions booming) (shouting and chattering) - Back the other way!

This is war, and you can't let your emotions run wild. Germans did the same thing to us at Arnem. - This isn't war. These people were innocent. We've been massacring poor villagers, not fighting. - Yes, but the villagers and the soldiers fight against us, together. My whole family, they were killed, and they weren't fighting against the German army. So it's really just the same. - No one left. What do we do now, Major? - Hmm. Go back to headquarters. - All right. Back to headquarters. Move. - Hurry. Come on. (panting) (birds chirping and squawking) Do you hear any more guns? - [Man] No. - They must've taken headquarters. (mumbling and panting) - Sergeant, let's go back. - Yeah, okay, yeah. - Come on. (solemn music) (grunting) - Dammit. Should've stayed and fought. Stayed, never have believed this. Damn those bastards, damn 'em. Damn them. (insects buzzing) - Bastards. - [Man] Captain Bondan. Oh no. - Captain. Captain Bondan. Put him down. Captain Bondan. We'll have vengeance. This will not go unpunished. (crying) - Captain. I promise to avenge your death. - [Lieutenant] Captain Bondan. We will always remember you. - Damn them. - Tonight we will attack them. If you want to make yourself useful, do it now. - Yes. Yes. (insects chirping) (upbeat music) (people singing in foreign language) - All right, we're here, we have to blow up this warehouse. (gasping) We have to be careful. They're on the lookout. - Yeah. (singing in foreign language) (grunts) (gasping) - Come on.

You go free the prisoners. - You bet. - Yeah. - Let's go. Come on. (singing in foreign language) - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. It's almost that time when you should fill your glass full of champagne and celebrate the new year. (cheering and chattering) - [Woman] Okay, let's watch the clock.
