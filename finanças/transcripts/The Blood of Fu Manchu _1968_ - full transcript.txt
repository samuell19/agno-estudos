You have been chosen to take part in a great mission, As the instruments of my destiny. No! when my father gives an order, you will obey, Or die. Centuries ago, an ancient race conquered this continent. now, their secrets are mine, and with this knowledge, I shall master the world. 500 years ago, The priests of a lost civilization lived in this city. They distilled a poison more deadly than any known to man. That poison still exists today. What is your name? Celeste. You are fortunate, Celeste. You shall be our first emissary. Observe your lover. the moon is full, The moon of life. let her taste the kiss Of death! power of ancient poison transmit to this girl, So that she will destroy the enemy in our path. Strike. She shall be the first. The first of ten. The old one. you have suffered torture for many days before you showed us the hidden secrets of this temple, And yet, you are still alive. to show your sisters how powerful is the poison that you carry, you will kiss him On the lips. He will become sightless, and then he will die. I've placed Celeste in your charge. See to it that her next lover receives a prolonged embrace. Nayland Smith. a most persistent man, He must be eliminated. Hold. Why are you in such a hurry, Carl? You are too fast for me. judging by this old map, A hidden city should lie... In that direction. But who knows how accurate it may be. Why don't we make camp and spend the night here? We are not due to meet Ursula in melia for another week. We must push on. At least as far as the river. The city must be near the water. Patience, my friends, that's the first virtue in archaeology... You know I haven't the time to be patient. Haven't you? Tell me, Carl. Why is it so urgent to find the secret city? It's been lost for hundreds of years. Carl, how can a day or so more mean so much? I can't explain to you, Dr. Wagner, yet. But believe me, time is important. Perhaps one day, you will understand. Come on, pinder, only a few miles more. It's very strange, I've never seen it before. What is it? These kind of rocks from the heart of the jungle. Here. Give me your hand. - Senor, por favor! - What's happened? Have a look. Dr. Wagner, Brought a pistol? = yes. Get it. Dr. Wagner! Dr. Wagner... Hold on! Don't let her go! She will not escape. Very well. Each of you has been initiated. Each of you has her destination. Rome, Berlin, New York, Tokyo, To the ends of the earth. each of you has had appointed task With the ten men who are my greatest enemies. You will take them the gifts you bear upon your lips. Death. The first one leaves for London tonight. Please, sir, a telegram for you, sir. Hm. Thank you, lotus. Dr. petrie is late, sir. Shall I make supper? Carl Jansen. Hm? Uh, yes, uh, thank you, lotus. No. - Good evening, lotus. - Good evening, Dr. petrie. Thank you very much. Petrie, you're late. = yes. Well, it's very difficult to get a taxi in this part. I'm sure it must be. Especially when your mind is occupied by blonde. What? Don't be ridiculous! She's a... Very old friend of mine. = I'm sure she is. But she's still a blonde. And a dyed one at that. Well, yes, we've been serious about it. Do you know, I've sworn I saw a dacoit outside when I came in just now. You're quite right, you did. he's been huddled over that brazier since half-past six, Probably feels the cold, poor chap. Well, what does he want? I don't know, yet. But I expect we'll soon find out. I got this cable today from Carl Jansen. - And what's that to us? - He's in south America. And? about six months ago, I began hearing rumors that Fu manchu had turned about there. Fu manchu?! so I sent agents out to investigate, The best of them being Carl Jansen. this is his cable to tell me that He's getting close to Fu Manchu. and judging by our friend outside, Fu manchu is getting close to us. Now, I wonder... I must see nayland Smith. I'm nayland Smith. Good evening, madam. I'm nayland Smith. Can I help you? For heaven's sake, petrie, go after... Come here! Come here, I tell you! Who are you, and what have you done to nayland Smith? Go put in for an ambulance. What do you want? I want to see governor mexical immediately. The governor is very busy now. You wait here a moment. The senor wishes to see governor mexical. I don't know, it's very difficult. Excuse me, sir. There is a man called Carl Jansen who wants to be received by you. Who is he? An archaeologist. Send him in then. You can go. In there, senor. Governor mexical. My dear herr Jansen. And how is the archaeology business, huh? Very bad. Dr. Wagner's dead. Dead? Yes, Completely? Yes, completely. Checkmate in two. Of course. do you know I have been trying to work it out all morning. Coffee? Tequila? No. I have to get to melia. I have to meet Dr. Wagner's niece. She doesn't even know what's happened to her uncle. So I turn to you for help, excellency. Melia, not good country. No? Bandits. I must go to melia! We try to please... Melia. I need horses, good horses. I'm afraid you are not going to melia, herr Jansen. you see, herr Jansen, you are under arrest For the murder of Dr. Wagner. Oh, no. and since you will, you will be remaining here, Perhaps we have a little game of chess, yes? No, no! No, no! No, no! Poor you, you're frightened. You will be more frightened. you have disobeyed the master's orders, And you will be punished. But you will not die yet. Dr. petrie not back yet? It's been over an hour. He went to the morgue. Please come in, sir. - How are you, old chap? - Petrie, that girl! What did you find out about her? Yes, I just got back from the morgue. The morgue? Yes, she was knocked down and killed by a car just outside this house. She was carrying enough poison in her body to... Kill a regiment, and yet, she gets killed by a car! Look, look, I've got my analysis here. Like to see it? Ti can't see. I'm blind. Blind? Blind? Petrie, have you ever heard of the "kiss of death"? No. there's an old inca legend That some... priestesses were immunized To the poison of a black cobra. they let themselves be bitten by the snakes, And then were sent out to kiss certain chosen victims. Somehow, the poison was transmitted. And after a few days, the victim died. but first, he went blind Within a few seconds of receiving the kiss of death. And this is what you think you've got? I'm sure of it. It's the confirmation of my theory. Fu Manchu is in that region of south America, protected on one side by the andes, And on the other by the mato grosso. well, maybe that's so, But how in heaven's hame are we going to get your sight back? I'm convinced that we can only find the answer to that in south America. we must go to Santa cristabel, And find Carl Jansen. yes, but are you sure you're fit to undertake a long journey like that In your present state? I have to. Fu manchu is there, of that, I'm certain. he found the poison, And only he may know the antidote. the news from Paris, Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo. Everywhere, success. What news from London? Good... And bad. Celeste is dead. And nayland Smith? Received the death kiss, yet lives. He has left London with the help of friends and is flying south. Alert all our agents at seaports and landing fields. All new arrivals must be reported at once. What about the mountain road from Santa cristabel? You always said it was a weak link on our defense chain. It's bandit country. That land is covered with the force of experienced men. He will take care of Lopez. Lopez? Sancho Lopez, a bandit chief. Nayland Smith has many spies. Lopez might be one of them. Halt! Vamos! Ride! you can Rob everything there is to take here, But this night, you wine and be merry in melia! Go. They tell me you can dance. Tonight, you will dance for the last time. Take him to the guard house. This is the work of Sancho Lopez. Ketlan recognized him. Yuma. = yes. She has been disobedient. I shall teach her a final lesson tonight. I have better use for a girl of her... talents. Send for matteos the executioner. You mean the snake. For yuma. Tonight, you will find Sancho Lopez at melia. Yuma will kill him. Over here! That's right, yes, over here! The journey to the other side of the road, like the other one! Senor, the doctor woman come! - Ah, buenos dias, senora. - Thank you. - Welcome to melia, doctor... - Nurse Wagner. How many times do I have to tell you, senor? We are very glad you are here. We've been waiting for you for a long time now. Hey, nino, nino! Please, sit down. You know, to us, you are a gift. We have been needing a doctor here for such a long time now. oh, I have to meet my uncle here, Together with a friend, Carl Jansen. They are searching in the jungle for the old, lost city. Good doctor, our people are foolish here. Do not speak of the old city. There are frightening stories. But for hundreds of years, nobody has been talking about the city. What are these stories? Sancho Lopez! Silence! Buenos dias, hermanos. Buenos dias. we mean you no harm, but we need food and drink And a safe place for the night. Ha, melia is a good place to be, to be safe. Senorita. You are a blessing to my eyes. Permit me to introduce myself. I know very well who you are. Then you have the advantage of me. I am Ursula Wagner... = of course! You are the good lady who binds the wounds of my people. Would you bind my wounds, senorita? If need be. You, stupido! Wine for the senorita! I don't want any wine. Nobody refuses to drink with Sancho Lopez. What's this uniform mean? It is of no interest to you. Lovely, lovely. I have heard of you. You have an uncle who travels often in the jungle. That's none of your business. Everything here is my business. This is my country, and I am its king. some weeks ago, he and another man, Carl Jansen, Set off to find the lost city. Where are they now? I don't know. And if I did, I wouldn't tell you. king Sancho Lopez, Killer of women and small children. That's your title. Get on with enjoying yourselves! Terrible affair... When darkness comes, they will be drunk. And then you shall dance for them. Careful, careful. Sit down here. Well, uh... I'll just go outside and get the luggage. Stay here, will you. Petrie? Dr. petrie? Who is that?! Nayland Smith! What on earth? It's a dacoit knife. What's this paper? It's a message from Carl Jansen. The rendezvous is in melia. No pictures, only words. Terrible! Stop this fooling about, or I'll kill you. Music, stupidos! ole?l Get out. Get out! He's drunk! You see, this is the way Sancho Lopez leaves them. Everybody dancing! Come on, everybody, dance! Go on, you, dance! Stop. Kill him, and you will die, too. The master wants him alive. You are honored, Sancho Lopez. you will meet Fu Manchu face-to-face, And you will answer all his questions. Better be ready, bandit. Your move, governor mexical. Wait, my friend, wait. More haste, less speed, as you would say. Alright, Matey. A stitch in time, saves nine. After all, this game has only been going on for... For three days. Up there. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Where are you going? I have to see the governor at once, It is of great importance. I am sister Wagner from the mission service. Alright, so you're sister Wagner from the mission service, huh? Well, I'm sorry, the governor has been in conference now for the last three days. You can't see anyone, I'm afraid not. Stop her! Checkmate. - Excellency. - Go away! But... there is a woman. Give her a peso... No, make it two. She is the doctor's niece, Ursula Wagner. Ursula Wagner? Your excellency, I must see you! Carl. Ursula. Carl, what are you doing here, and where's my uncle? I'm dreadfully sorry. I have bad news for you. Your uncle's dead. What happened? We were attacked in the jungle. This... His excellency has kept me here these past three days. Some stupid charge of murder. Good chess players are hard to find. I can't be too particular. Anyway, I withdraw the charge. The game is over. And what brings you here, Ursula? I've come from melia. They need help, medical supplies, and food. But why? Last night, the village was attacked by bandits. Plundered and sacked. Bandits? Lead by Sancho Lopez. Excellency. the bandits were in turn attacked, And many of them killed. after the fight, at dawn, I returned to the village To give what help I could. One of the bandits is suffering a strange disease. He has been struck blind. Pedro! Pedro! Where is that fool? I must find Sancho Lopez! Call out the guard and the police! Call out the... But Sancho Lopez is prisoner already. Huh? Prisoner? Yes, he was captured and taken away by the others. An oriental woman was their leader. Oriental? Bring him out. He is an iron man. We will melt him. - Iron maiden. - Primitive, but effective. Lopez is not moved by the lash, And he can do without food or water. But doubtless, he is proud of being a man. May your soul rot in hell. I am Sancho Lopez! I would die before I even tell you the name of my dead wife. Interesting. Now, Sancho Lopez. Fu manchu, you want to know where my friends are, eh? And where I get my guns and my ammunition, eh? You work for nayland Smith. - Nayland Smith! - Who's he? for the last time, Where is nayland Smith? I've never heard of him. And I'm in no one's pay. and if you want to know where I get my arms, I buy them from the governor's men. We have an arrangement. Release him. - Father, are you sure? - He was telling the truth. You know this country better than any man? Very well. I will give you back your life. You shall work for me. you will seek out my enemies, And you will destroy them. Care for a cup of tea? = no. Well, if they don't need a decent cup of tea in these backwards places... No like tea. Tell me, which is right road to melia? Melia? = yes. Are you asking me which is the way to melia? I hired you to take me to melia. Why don't you know it? I thought you knew the right road to melia. Whoa! Excuse me, do you speak english? Yes, of course. Can I help you? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, this fool of a driver seems to have lost our way. Where were you going? The jungle is no place to get lost in. Carl Jansen! Nayland Smith? Thank heavens you're here. Now you can lead me to Fu Manchu. The girl. You will accompany Sancho Lopez. Wherever he goes, you go. when he has accomplished his deed, by destroying nayland Smith, You will destroy him with a kiss of death. You understand? Remove her. I'm ready. You know what to do? - I know better than you think, Fu Manchu... - What do you mean? your enemy is not nayland Smith, but, uh, A man named Carl Jansen. - Father. - Let him speak. He passes himself off as an archaeologist. I believe he's a spy. - For nayland Smith? - Who knows? He's clever. I thought, at one time, he was spying on me. You would know this man if you saw him? As I know my own brother. You want that I kill him, too? you will be given guns And an escort of my dacoits. Carmen will be your companion. Now I know that, that you trust me. You fail, and you die! Succeed... How much do you pay me? Freedom is not measured in terms of money. Take him to the grotto. Horses are ready. By tomorrow night's full moon, it will be over. Why the full moon? What's so important about that? The whole world will shortly learn how important it is. This sickness will finish when the moon is at its fullest. Until then, death will stand beside him at all times. Ursula! - Oh. - Back so soon? There was nothing to keep me at melia. the mission sisters have gone taking care of the sick people Oh, good, good. And nayland Smith? Well, he's worse, I'm afraid. I let him talk to Carl, against my better judgement. He's very, very weak. We must save him, Dr. petrie. only an antidote as strong as the poison That struck him down can save him. The answer lies somewhere here. Nayland Smith talked quite clearly. there is a link between his illness And the ghastly plan of Fu Manchu. In Santa cristabel, I heard the news. that all over the world, important people, heads of state, police chiefs, Influential men have been struck down like nine-pins. What?! All have, at some time, have incurred the enmity of Fu Manchu. Look here, doctor. Here's melia. And this is our position now. here, I believe, in the heart of the jungle, Is the hideout of Fu Manchu. Are you sure? If I were, I would've called up a regiment to attack the stronghold. It must be guarded like a fortress. But two might succeed where a hundred men might fail. Well, it... Well, it seems a desperate measure, but we're running out of time. I agree. Do you think nayland Smith will be safe here? Yes, he'll be as safe here as anywhere else. I think the jungle is too thick for horses. I think we can do without your men. We have escorted you further than we were ordered to. Get back to melia. Alright, mount up. Filthy spy, talk! Or would you rather I cut off your tongue? I will tell you anything you ask of me. First, your name. Pinda. And who do you work for? Is it Jansen? Huh? So it is. Now, tell me about Jansen. He is to meet me... Before sundown. Ride deep into the jungle! We'll have to leave the horses. Cup of tea? = huh? Let me. Once we get to the Ridge, we'll be in open country. Beyond that, the grotto. Here. Cold tea, no horses. I wonder why I go abroad. Come on, petrie. Get back under cover. Fu manchu, a present for you! Dr. petrie. This is an unexpected pleasure. Not for me. Who is this girl? = a nurse. I thought she might be useful, too. Lin tang. See that senor Lopez is suitably rewarded. so, Dr. petrie, You have replaced the late, lamented nayland Smith. Nayland Smith is very much alive, Fu Manchu. Indeed. Allow me to show you something, doctor. your friend, nayland Smith, received the kiss of death, As did some of the most important men in the world's capitals. Men known to be my closest enemies. But they are only the prelude to my drama, Dr. petrie. the same poison that has been given to ten, Can be given to millions. And shall be, if the world disobeys me. When the moon is full, Those who have received the kiss will die at once. and then, I shall announce to the world That it lies completely within my power. as a further demonstration of what its fate will be if it continues to defy me I shall, at the same time, Commit an act that will be long remembered. in these containers, Is enough poison to destroy a thousand men. Multiply that ten thousand times, and... already my agents are nearing London, Bearing with them such a gift. And upon my signal, the poisonous cloud will be released. That will be my message to the world. capitulate, Or the same death will be the fate of millions more. I do not doubt that after that, The rest of the world will accept my command. Already men are dying. and in the great cities of the world, My orders have been obeyed. we have travelled many miles To fulfill our master's instructions. Now, we are about to perform our last serving. after we receive a signal from our master, We shall release the contents of this urn. Everlasting death. horrible, inescapable, universal Death. Get them out! if I wasn't an english gentleman, I'd tell you what you were, you pot-bellied bastard! Ketlan. I remember you. We had a fight, eh? Now, I win. Come with me. in a few hours, The moon will be full. Carl must be out there somewhere. My tea is in my thermos on my back, and I can't get at it. He's our only hope. It's getting cold, and I need it! Dr. petrie. Have you lost hope? it's like the grains of sand Dropping through an hourglass. 7... We... We have no time on our side, my dear. do you believe that all of those men, nayland Smith and the rest, Will die when the moon comes up? Yes, and I feel worse than death. the whole of London will be destroyed because of this terrible plan of Fu Manchu, Proving to the world that he has the power of infinite destruction. Father. I see terrible signs in the smoke. Death and destruction for us. The trees are withering. and the rocks are crumbling And screeching. It is almost time. Have the prisoners brought up from their cells. Here. Help. Come here. My good friend, Fu Manchu, agreed to protect me. - Yes, sir. - To help me. - Yes, sir. - Well... help! Open here. Yes, sir. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Let us out, or do you want some more? Sancho, we must. - Go on! - Alright. Come on then, come on! Hurry up. What's the matter with you? Quiet! Come on, you... How are ya? Oh, wait a minute! Below here is the fuel store. - What does he use for fuel? - Oil, many thousands of gallons. There is no way out here. Come on! How's your head, Lopez? My head? Huh? Couldn't be better! Vamos, amigos! This is as far as you come, my friends. You can't get away on your own. With this, I can go to hell and back. Ah! Now, lose yourselves, or I start shooting. - Sancho, you can't! - She's right. Ursula. Watch! Hurry. - Here. - Thank you. if you value your hide, Make no sound. They must have escaped by the old tunnel. Carmen knows the way. They will not go far. But if they should manage to reach the waterfall? They will not escape. From this vantage point, a man could hold up an army. Who wants to hold off anybody? For heaven's sake, man! There's your answer, petrie. Quick, get Ursula down to the Ridge, among the trees. And I, senor? Of course. Hurry, I'll cover you. I need no cover. I'll take my own chances. You'll have to now. Be off, get going. And I shall take you with me. I know this territory. Come. Dr. petrie! Kiss of death. Perhaps she has the antidote in her blood... Get down! Get down! Go fast! I'll cover you! Go! They have gone by the waterfall. There is only one man left on guard. they have got away by the waterfall, And there's only one man holding the rear guard on top of the cliff. One is enough. tell the men to wait until it is dark, And then to circle around to pin him down. in the meantime, Let him wait, like an ant upon an anvil. Never knowing when the hammer blow will strike. But the others will escape. there is no escape from the death That Carmen carries with her. He's still alive. I think we can save you, old friend. Now listen, only the women are immune. they are the carriers of the kiss of death, But they also carry the antidote. now, I have here a girl who's been touched with the poison, and I think that her blood Will counteract the poison in you. A poison to kill a poison. Wish I had some transfusion equipment, but there's no time. Hot water! Be brave. Ahh! Ahh! We have no time for refinements, Mr. Jansen. instead, we shall give you a fond caress From the angel of death itself. when given through the kiss of a woman, The plague takes six weeks to complete its work. but in your case, the serpent shall strike you directly on the mouth, And you die. at the same time, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that all my other enemies, including nayland Smith, Shall also perish. Now. Nayland Smith! Bow to me! Beg! Beg for your lives! There's enough oil to blow the place sky high! There. The end for the lost city. And thank god, the end of Fu Manchu. my dear, old friend, I wish I could be certain of that. The world shall hear from me again.
