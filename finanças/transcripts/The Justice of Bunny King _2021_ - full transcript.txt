Hey. Hey, babe! Give you one on the house, huh? Go on! Oi! Sem! You need to do long strokes. Long strokes. Sorry, man. He's just trying to raise some money to buy a couple of blue pens and a 1B5. Pigs! Run, Jah, run! - Hurry up. Move! - Fuck! - Yeah? - Sweet as. Thanks. Jah? Jah. Hey. Got you one. - Hey! What? - For you. Really? Oh, man. No, sorry, I can't see your name here. I was told that I could just get an appointment today. No, there's nothing left today. I just spent my last 10 bucks trying to get us here. Fill in a form, and I'll pop your name for 10.15 tomorrow. Here. Ask for a review form. Write a complaint. Thank you. I'm just gonna put you on to your knees, all right? There you go. The other hand. Up you go. You got this. There we go. Oh! - Look. - So cool. You're stronger than most people. You know that? Hey, baby. Mumma! Mummy! You're so heavy! Oh! Do some more colouring on the fire. Make the fire fiery. Shannon? Do you want to use another colour? You can use another colour if you want. Why are you talking to her like that? She knows what she wants. I like this colour. We could do a drawing on Reuben's cast, eh? You draw Pegasus, and I will draw... Hey. Why do pens go to prison? Hm? To do long... sentences! You've ruined it. Can you give us some privacy, please? Oh, it's very important that I take notes. I wanna do some yellow! Just... It's getting a bit stuffy in here, isn't it? How about we continue this meeting in the playhouse? Yes, yes! - No, Bunny. - Yes! Bunny, please. Yeah! - Oh, look! - Ow. Look at this beautiful house. Dingle dangle! - Oh, I can't move! - I got the dingle dangle! Yeah! Nice indoor-outdoor flow. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Made it. Phew! Look at this beautiful house. I want Kura to bring me here for my birthday. Is Kura who looks after you? Mum, can you come to my party? I made an invitation. Did you? Did you do this drawing? Yeah. - Oh! - Mum's not allowed to come. It's against the rules. I'm gonna have you both with me by your birthday, though. Don't tell her that. It's bullshit, and you're confusing her. Well, I'm gonna get a house for us all real soon. OK! That's enough, Bunny. Are we really gonna have my birthday at our new house? Yes, baby. And we can go to the hot pools! Bunny. Sorry. I'm going to have to end the visit today. - OK? I'll let you say goodbye. - What? No, because... No, because I've got another 15 minutes. Come on, Shan. We have to go. - No, you don't have to. - No! - Please don't do this. - We've discussed this. OK? You know the rules. Please don't ignore me. Can we really go to the pools on my birthday? - Yes, baby. - Promise? I promise. I promise. Yeah. We can't approve a visit for Shannon's birthday until your case is reviewed, and we can't review your case until you have a house. You were supposed to help me find a place to live. There's a... very long wait list with Housing New Zealand, so you are better off looking yourself. There's no houses in a housing shortage, Ai Ling. Have you been to another Positive Parenting session? - Mm. - OK. Good. I've also booked you in with, um, Dress to Impress next week. It's really important that you don't miss it. OK? They can give you some tidy clothes for any job interviews you might have. Just... get your bond sorted. Just small steps. OK? Yep. Auntie Bunny! Hold my bag for a sec? Yep. - Tag. - Oh! You wait for me up at the corner! I'm gonna beat you! I'm gonna beat you to the top. Hi, Granny. Hi, Cynthia. Hey. You want me to shuffle? Did you hide biscuits, Auntie Bunny? Yep, and you will never find them! Aw! Eat some fruit. I'm doing a terrible shuffle. Should've sent me to the casino. There you go, Cynthia. Hey, Tonyah. How are you? Oh! 'Hi, Auntie. I'm real good, thanks. How are you?' 'Oh, yeah, I'm real good, thanks.' Sorry. I'm sorry! You're just the worst person I know at roundabouts. Oh. Hey, Mum. Ooh! Thank you. - Hombres. - Hey, Dad. Hey. Oh my goodness. Are you grumpy? Are you grumpy? Oh no, no grumpy! Looked at another house today. Hm. Oh, yeah? It was pretty cramped. I really need to find a place that's big enough for me and the kids, you know. Yeah. Well, you can stay here as long as you like. As long as you do the dinners and look after the kids and that. Grace never wants you to leave. Cool. - Thanks. - All right. Hey, do you reckon you could, um, wash my car later? You're just the best person I know at washing cars, so... Sure. No problem. Choice. What are we watching? - Tonyah! - Don't! - It's my turn! - Piss off! It's my turn! - You've had it for ages! - Get off! Get off! - Auntie Bunny? - Tonya won't give me my turn. - Narking little shit. - Give him a go, please, Ton. - But he sucks! - Oh. Go on, then, have it. - Ow! - Ow! - I didn't even touch him! - In the kitchen. - Oh... - Now. - Oh! I didn't even touch him. Give it. Read a book. - Come on! - Go, go, go! Come on! Hey! Hey! Tackle him! Yee-hee-hee! Oh, sorry. - Did you... Did you want some? - No. Ha. You just have to ask. - Mm! - Sorry. You worked late. Yeah, I did a double shift. - Kids OK? - Kids are good. There's some dinner in the microwave. Thanks. - God, it's freezing. - Hop in. I needed a hot-water bottle. Aw. You're working too hard. Just trying to save. You saw the kids today, eh? Yeah. I should go see them. Well, you can see them any time you like. Tell 'em I think about them heaps. 'Hey, Reuben. 'Hey, Shannon. 'Your auntie has thought about you heaps.' Don't start. - You know we can't take them. - I didn't. I just need you to take your shoes off, thanks. Oh. - Is this carpet new? - There are a lot of people - interested, just so you know. - Oh. No, I'm gonna take it. Uh, no. I mean... Look, have you got any references? It's just pointless if you don't leave one. Oh, yeah, my sister's my landlord. I'll give you her number. Uh, and I'll need proof of income. A payslip or letter from your employer. I'm self-employed. How much is your benefit? $230, plus accommodation supplement. Thanks for coming. One sec. I just didn't see the bathroom. It's lovely! Uh, you'll need to go. I have to lock up. - Shit water pressure. - Um, can you please leave now? You didn't take your shoes off. Tag. You're it. No, you are. - I'm gonna get you! - Bet you can't! - Hi. - Hi. - How was work? - I'm glad it's over. - You hungry? - Yeah. Oh. Made you your favourite. I hope it's warm enough. You've gone weird. What do you want? I wanna ask if I can have your garage as a place. Get some beds and some rugs and... have the kids come to stay. It's Shannon's birthday in a couple of weeks. I told you it's not up to me. Well, can you ask Bevan? He's already letting you stay. You gotta stand on your own two feet. I'm not asking you to be their guardian. This is Bevan's house. It's his rules. You talking about me? You know what? It's real cold and shitty down there in the garage, Bunny. I will get blankets. I'll get a heater. I'll still look after the kids. I'll look after Cynthia. I'll do the meals. I'll even clean your car once a week. It'd be nice for the kids to spend time with their cousins. Of course. You could pay some more rent. That'd be cool. Thanks, babe. You didn't have to do that. Family's family, love. I'm off to bed. - Night. - Night. Aw. Shame. Get that off for you. There you go, lady. Oh! Piss off! - Are you sure? - I want to. Oh. Thanks, lady! You're helping me set up my new house! Oh! True, Bunny? Found you a place? Yeah. It's mean! My sister and brother-in-law have given me their garage to live in. Kids'll love it. - I'm gonna do it up hard. - Yeah. Fuck. What's wrong? Aw, fuck! What're you doing? Jesus! Stop it! What are you doing? Aw! Just-We came back from a driving lesson! Fucking pervert! She... Oh, fuck you. You believe that, do you? I let you in my fuckin' house, and you went and fuckin' thought that, did you? You get the fuck outta my house, eh! Get the fuck out of my house! And you don't come back! Eh? You come in here and you accuse me of bullshit! Fuck off! Eh? Get the fuck out! Ton? Ton? Sweetie? I'm just gonna go down the school and get the kids. Oh, f... You don't know what you're talking about. He's basically my dad. That's fucking gross. Just lock it. OK? Grace! Gracie. Gracie. Open the door. I need to speak with you. What is it? - Are you OK? Is it the kids? - No. Nah. She made up some bullshit lie that I've done something to my step-daughter. You'd believe her over me? That's what you think of me, is it? Why-? Why would she-? - Why would she say that? - Why would she say it? Why would she say it? Because she wants what we've got. OK? She wants a house. I don't know why she'd lie. Why would she lie? I wasn't doing anything but giving her a driving lesson. Go and ask Tonyah. - I don't know what to believe. - Why would I lie about that? I don't know. If you don't believe me, you go and ask Ton. No, I do, honey. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get out! Where's my money? Where's my fuckin' money? You know what the problem is? She fucking killed her husband, and she went to prison. That's why she can't get her kids back. We should never have let her stay in the first place. Hi, it's Tonyah. I won't listen to your message, but you can send me a text. I can buy you some togs for your birthday. Are we going to do the slides? Oh, yeah. But Reuben says I'm not big enough for them. Oh, they're pretty fast, but... I'll hold on to you real tight, OK? Hey, baby, is your brother there, real quick? Reuben! You're not supposed to call. They won't let us see you if you don't start doing things properly. I know. I just... It's just taking me a bit longer to get a house, that's all. We can still go to the hot pools, though. You going away, Bunny? I got kicked out of home. You can come and crash at mine's if you want. - Sure? - Serious. Hey, what's up, lady? Every car's got automatic windscreen wipers. - What you're doing is begging. - OK. Chill out, lady. Next you'll be offering to sit on the front of my car, shining a torch when it gets dark. - OK, yeah. - Fuckin' moll! - You stupid bitch! - Oi! Wipe that off! How dare you? Look at my windscreen! - Fuck her. - Look, I'll clean it up- Why don't you get proper jobs instead of begging? Well, what would you like us to do? Would you like us to clean windows or smash them? Don't you threaten me! Stupid bitch. That was mean, Bunny! Did you see her face? Thanks, Semu. - Sefa? - Yeah, Mum? Aumai se nofoa, darling. Uh, Bunny, make sure you get yourself a plate, please. Oh, your chair's coming. Thank you. Is there enough rice? Have a look. - Here you go. Mum. - Yeah? Uh, o lea o su ese mea e moe ai Bunny? Ese a? O fea o le a momoe ai Bunny? Joseph's gonna crash on the couch. - Aw! - Shh! - Se uma. - Is it OK? - Yeah, don't worry. Fa'afetai Iesu foa'i mai mea ai tausi ai matou le fanau. - Amene. - Amene. Make sure Bunny's got some rice. Here. Go for it. There's some beans and beef here as well, Bunny. Please... Yep. Please help yourself. Eat up. - Joseph! - What's this? That one is, um, fly eggs. - I'm just kidding. - I know what that is. - That is rice. - I know. I know it's rice. - I've seen rice before. - I know it's rice. I've even eaten rice before. So, how do you know Semu, Bunny? Oh, just from work. Yeah, she's my boss from Wash and Wax. - Ah. - He's my star employee. - Eh? - Oh. - It's hard work, though. - Yeah. Do you want some of this? Ni-night, baby. Goodnight. Hang in there, Bunny. Things will get better. Goodnight. Tonyah. Tonyah, can you hear me? Tonyah! Shut up! Are you trying to wake Mum up or something? Did you talk to her? She said you must be fuckin' sick to make something like that up. Did I make it up? - I wanna go with you. - Why? What's happened? What is it? What's he done? Bunny, can I live with you? I haven't got a house yet, Ton. Mum's awake. I gotta go. You just keep that door locked. Come to my fuckin' house again and the cops will know about it. Paedophiles don't call the cops. I was actually just on the phone to someone called Ai Ling. Yeah. We were talking about how Grace and I would love to take in Reuben and Shannon. Be nice for them, having a family a real good home, normal fuckin' home. What d'you reckon about that? You... stay the fuck away from them! Fuck off! Fuck you! Fuck. Run, Bunny! Run! Come back here! Don't fuckin' do that to my car! Oi! Fuck, no, man. Come here! Fuck you! You're not gonna fuckin' see your kids again! Aw, shut up! - You're fuckin' mental! - Fuck you, dickhead! She smashed my window! She pissed in my fucking car! Fuck me! I'll come and shit in your car. How's that? - Pissed in his car! - Eh, bro? Let's go. Good girl. Ah! Oh! Go straight for that stuff there. - Yeah! Oh! - Oh! That's all right. Here we go. All right. - Kia ora. - Oh! You all right? Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I'm, uh... They're my kids. I'm Bunny. Hey, I don't actually think you're supposed to be here. - Nah. - I don't think it's allowed. Nah, yep. Oh! It's OK! It's OK. Just... Just give me a minute, OK? Wait here. Yep. Reuben, look! Has Bevan been round? No. Why? Nothing. Is it OK here? Are they nice? Yep. You would tell me, eh? Just promise me you would. - Just promise? - Mum. Reuben's gotta come in for dinner now. - What's for dinner, Mum? - Ooh! I'm not Mum. Look. That's Mum there. - Hi, baby. - Mummy! Hey, baby. Oh, you're big! - Hey. Baby. - Mum. Mummy. My babe. Kura told me how to do butterfly kisses. Did she? - Yeah. - Can I have one? It's time for dinner. Come on. Let's go wash our hands. - You too, Reuben. - Mummy. Gotta wash my hands, Mummy. OK, baby. - I love you. - Come on, buddy, Come and wash your hands too, please, Reuben. This isn't where they should be. We're doing our best, Bunny. Well, how long till you get sick of them? - Mum. - You shouldn't be here, Bunny. - Don't talk to her like that. - They're my kids! Come inside, mate. They're meant to live with me. I need you to leave now, OK? Reuben. Look, Reuben doesn't need to see you like this. - Please. - I'll just say goodbye. - No, no. Mum's going to go. - I need to say goodbye. - Oh... - I need you to leave now. He just wants to say goodbye to me! Hey! We didn't get to say goodbye properly! - Let me say goodbye. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! - She hasn't done anything. I'm just trying to say goodbye to my son! Have you got any kids' swimsuits? I don't, sorry. What would you say your look is? Homeless squeegee bandit, but sexy. You've got beautiful eyes. I think if we add some colour... Yeah, just pants is good, thanks. You know, I'd say you get about five seconds to make an impression on a potential employer. Oh, it's not really a job interview. It's just, uh, I need to get a house before I can get my kids back. Same applies. Would you wear this? I wouldn't normally wear any of this stuff. Just feels like lying. It's beautiful lying. You know, it's not just about passing. It's about being. Yeah. The look sells it. But you need to believe it too. See? You need to believe that you deserve to get a place. For you and for your kids. There. Would you give that lady a place to live? Yep. So would I. In a heartbeat. Have you, uh, been looking long? Yes, actually. Investment property or a little lock-up-and-leave? - Oh, it's for my family. - Oh, nice. How many children do you have? - Oh, two. - Yeah? Oh, three, actually, cos my niece might come and live with us. Sure, sure. Cool. And, um, what kind of budget are we looking at? Well... Oh, 500? - 550? - Oh, OK. Well, yeah, we've got a few two-beddies for sale at that kind of asking price. Would you be open to living in the central city? Oh, well,... yes, I would. - That's me, Neil. - Ah. Well, Neil, - I'm Lizzie. - OK. So, this is us. It's actually a very respectful, professional community here, you'll find, Lizzie, so, re the kids, safe as houses. And the great thing is, keyless entry. - If you lose your card. - Mm. Oh. Wow. And north-facing sun all day long. Mm. The others have already been snapped up. Hm. So it's my last one. It's so close. So close. Would you rent this? Oh, no. I don't do rentals. Hm. You're not buying, are you? No, Neil. I'm not buying. And that's not north. North's that way, Neil. I know which way north is. Can I buy you a drink sometime? Well, I might just take you up on that, Neil. I've got your number, so my PA will be in touch. Bye. You coming to church tomorrow, Bunny? What, you trying to convert me? Nah. Nah. I gotta see someone about a house. Oh, true? Well, I hope you get it. I'll be sure to say talofa to God from Bunny, eh? - Goodnight. - Night. - Hi. - Hello. - Come on in. - Thank you. - I'll show you round. - Sure. Reuben's room's just up here. In there. This is really great for you, Bunny. Pulled it off just in time. Good on you, girl. Here's the bathroom. Bunny! Bunny! Hey, Bunny. Esther forgot the cake. Oh. Hi, there. Hello. This is my landlord. This is Ai Ling from GFS. You have a very lovely home. - Thank you. - It's taken a long time to find a place suitable for your children, hasn't it, Bunny? I think it was worth the wait. Thanks to you, though. Uh, well, it's been... lovely having Bunny here, and, um,... look, there's plenty of room for her kids too. Yeah. Yeah, and cool that it's just in time for Shannon's birthday too. Oh! Actually, um, can I get you to sign this? Just here. Thanks. Great. And I'll arrange access with the foster parents for the day. Look, lovely to meet you, Ai Ling. I'll leave you guys to it. I'm late for church. Thank you. I'll be in touch. Bye. Oh. Ugh. Fuck! Ton! Ton! Ton, it's me. What are you doing in Bevan's car? - He'll smash you. - Had to borrow it for a bit. I've got us a place, but we gotta go now. You wanna come with me? Jump in. - What are you wearing? - This is my new look. Sort of professional corporate entrepreneur, but sexy. Shame. What's that smell? Oh, it smells like piss in here! Yeah. Put your seatbelt on. Shut up. You do not live here! Posh, eh? Pool! Everything looks so small from up here. Nothing can touch us. Can we stay here forever? Yeah. Night, Ton. Ton? Ton? Ton! Ton! Hey! Hey! Ton! Hey! Hey. I was just floating. My baby went blue because she couldn't breathe! Sorry. I didn't know if she was coming back. One night he shook her so hard. And then he just slammed her into a wall. I remember looking at him and thinking,... 'I wanna do to you what you did to her.' I got this animal rage. Mm. It's Shannon's birthday today. Hm. I gotta go and get her prezzies. Just let me sleep a bit longer, but you can go to the shop. Nah, nah. Nup, nup, nup I'm not gonna leave you here. I am taking Shannon to the hot pools. And you're coming. I like it here, though. All right. I'll be back before 9. But you gotta get ready. While I buy the prezzies, you get ready. Ready for 9 sharp. OK. Fuckin' no! Fuckin' no! Hmm. That's $9.99, thanks. D'you want a receipt? Nah, it's all good. Excuse me! Hi. It's, um, my little girl's birthday today, and I'm having a party for her. We can't have the party at my house any more, so we, uh... I'm just wondering... Ai Ling's organised for us to have a visit, and I'm just wondering if I'm going to meet them at the hot pools or if I can pick them up from the foster carer. Um, what... what Ai Ling's organised. If you could just put in your details. Oh, no, Ai Ling knows my details. You can just look it up. She's organised my kids birthday visit for today. If you could just take a seat and fill in the form. What time does Ai Ling start work? 9 o'clock. Hi, Bunny. I'm Lisa. Where's Ai Ling? I'm waiting for Ai Ling. Ai Ling's on training in Hamilton. No. Look, I just need to speak with Ai Ling. She's approved my house, and she's arranged my kid's birthday visit. - It's today. - All right, Bunny. I need to just check the paperwork, OK? Oh. That's a shame. What? You trespassed at the foster home. The carers have appealed against the transfer, but under the circumstances it's extremely unlikely - that they will- - Transfer? What...? What transfer? - All right. Bunny,... - Oh, oh, oh, no. - I need to speak to Ai Ling. - The children's file has gone on to a new office, and they will be appointed a new caseworker. - Where have you sent them? - So the best thing you can do is send an email, and then I can send that on. How shall I send you an email? A fucking email?! - On my smartphone? - All right, sorry. Where the fuck have you sent my kids? I can't tell you where the kids are, Bunny. It's my job to keep them safe. From me? All right. Yep. - Shit! - Sorry! - Oh God! - Sorry! - No, it's fine. - Sorry. - Here, let me help you. - Just don't... It's fine. Don't worry. Don't worry. Just leave it. Just leave it. Sorry. So sorry. Fuck. Thames. Fuck! Ton! We gotta go! ...north-facing all day... - Tonyah? - Uh, sorry. Excuse me, who are you? I'd think about changing that code, if I were you, Neil. 2468 - it's like a child's PIN number. I am so sorry about this. This is, uh, very unusual. - Ton, where are you? - Just, um, one second. Ton, where are you? Ton? We gotta go! What the fuck? - Who's he?! - Who the hell is she? This is my niece, Tonyah. Tonyah, say hello to Neil. Still wanna get that drink, Neil? Nah, didn't think so. Come on. You're a fucking bullshit artist. I've been waiting in that cupboard - for the past fucking hour! - It's lucky they had great built-in storage, then, isn't it? Well, now where are we going? We're going to Shannon's birthday party. - In Thames. You're gonna get caught, and then what's gonna happen? You were supposed to look after me. I am looking after you. I'm doing the best I can. Well, your best is shit. Shit! Can you turn that off? - Just turn the thing off. - It's my phone! Sorry. It's OK, babe. She never even asked me if it was true. Why didn't she ask me? I wish we could just drive away into a new life. And never stop. Me too. ♪ When the neon's pressed up against your flesh ♪ and nobody's sayin' a thing. ♪ Then I wake from night in the broad daylight ♪ sent the whole world into a spin. ♪ I'm runnin' in a field, runnin' in a field, ♪ runnin' in a field of ice. ♪ There are ways... ♪ to keep walkin'. ♪ Don't get in the way. ♪ Just keep walkin'. ♪ Just keep... ♪ I got nothin' but the taste, nothin' but the smell ♪ of piss stains. ♪ A rider only comes when he comes ♪ with the setting sun. ♪ Just keep walkin'. ♪ Just keep...

We've just arrived from up Auckland to deliver some birthday presents for my niece, and I can't find the address. - I had it on a piece of paper. - OK. They're my sister's kids. - Reuben and Shannon. - All right, if you could just fill this in and then take a seat, and someone will be with you shortly. Thank you so much. - Here you go. - Thank you. Mrs Kakariki? Just follow me. Wait here, Ton. I'll be back in a tick. - I'll just take that, thanks. - Excuse me. - It's all right. - Excuse me! - Hi. - Sorry, Trish. Thanks, Alistair. Thanks for seeing me, Trish. I'm on a bit of a tight schedule. Gotta pick up the kids before 6. Grace King. Yep, that's me. Oh, it's your niece's birthday. You've lost the address. Yeah, so stupid. On the back of a supermarket receipt. We've organised the hot pools for 6. Heaps of prezzies and a cake too. Hmm. Grace King, right? Yeah, Grace. Yeah. The... The children are Reuben and Shannon King. Shannon King, 5 years old. - Reuben, 14 years old. - Yeah. Mother, Bunny King. Oh, yeah. What did I say? Sorry. I'm Grace Murray. I was King. Sorry. It's been a very long day. Oh, look. Here she is. Bunny King. Look,... it's my little girl's birthday, and I promised her. If I can just drop off the prezzies and the cake,... no worries. Be gone. You know. No one needs to know. Who's the young girl with you, Bunny? That's my niece, Tonyah. Does her mother, Grace, know she's here? Yes. We're all family. I mean, I... I live with them. Big house? Uh... I see here you have accommodation. Yes. Police? - Been approved? - Yes. Is Tonyah on a day off from school, is she? Yes. Just hold on for a minute, would you? I just need to check something, Bunny. Hello. You must be Tonyah. Hi there. My name's Trish, and this is my colleague Alistair. Now, your Auntie Bunny's just asked if you'd like to join us for afternoon tea in the other room. Would you like to come through? Alistair'll take you. Hey. They're mine. Would that be all right, Tonyah? That would be just lovely. Yeah, we're just gonna go and have afternoon tea down here. Get off! Bunny? Bunny! - Bunny! - Hey! - Get off me! Get off! Bunny! - Let me outta here! - Bunny! - It's OK, Tonyah. - Fucking let me out! - Hey! - Get off me. Get off me! Fucking get your hands off her! Get off! Hey! Bunny! Jesus! You get away from her! Don. You fuckin' get away! Clear everyone out. - Fuck off! - Bunny. Let Tonyah go back to her parents, and I promise I'll get the presents to your children. But I need you to calm down. Oh, don't you tell me to fuckin' calm down! I've done my time. I've done counselling. I've done that parenting course. I've done so much fuckin' stuff. Whatever you've asked me to do, I've done it. You have done nothing for me! Nothing! My children have been taken away to another place. Nobody fuckin' told me! Well, I'm sorry that you feel like that. But think about it. You've trespassed on the carers' property, stolen a vehicle, abducted your niece. My children are expecting me. I promised them. We have a responsibility to them first. Then you're supposed to give them back to their mum, you fuck! OK. Their address. Print it. Hurry up! You OK, Ton? Yep. Hurry up. Hurry up! OK. Now fuck off outside. Go on. Ton, get the presents. Oh, this isn't the way to see your kids. No shit. I've tried all the other ways. I am out of ideas. Leave her, Tonyah. Stay with me! Piss off. No. No, in. In. Go back. Ton, quick! Get a chair, get a chair, get a chair. In! In! Move! Shit, Ton. Sit. You're doing it wrong! What's your plan now, Bunny? Oh, shut the fuck up and let me think. Why don't you let her go, keep me instead? I never said you could leave. In. Suspect is a 40-year-old female, believed to be armed. History of manslaughter. Currently wanted for abduction, assault and auto theft. She's... She's held a knife to her throat and she started screaming. - It's probably meth. - What sort of knife? Can you get me a line in? Hello? Yes. 9 to 4, but we're not open today. Come in tomorrow. To be honest, we're probably just gonna tell you you're a bad mother, because you're poor. - What? - Is that Bunny? Am I speaking with Bunny King? Bunny, this is Detective Goodman. Listen, I'm here so we can work things out together, OK? Why don't you come to the door? This is what's gonna happen. You're gonna bring my children here for my daughter's birthday. Bunny, I just wanna have a little bit of a chat. Shut the fuck up. Just you bring me my kids. You gonna help me celebrate my little girl's birthday, then, Trish? Fine. You're not invited. Is that Bunny? Bunny, what was that? She's got a gun. Bunny, is everyone safe in there? Bunny? Don't call me till my kids are outside. I can hold that if you like. You've done this before, haven't you? For your little sister and brother? How old are they? What's it to you? Just wondering if they miss you. - And your mum and dad. - He's not my fucking dad. You don't know me. OK? You're right. I don't. Tonyah, I know this. Your mum will be really worried about you. And I bet she loves you very much. She doesn't love me. No, all she cares about is him. And I'm-I'm not going back to that house. Ever. He's... He's a fucking creep. Why's he a creep? Ton? Here. I'm sorry. Wasn't meant to be like this. Let's just do the streamers. Oh! Hello? Are they coming? I want a straight answer. Are my children coming? Yeah. Yeah, they're on their way. We'll bring them in, and you can have your party. And after that, we'll have a little chat. But promise me you will not hurt Trish and Tonyah. Bunny? And why should I believe you? You have my word. You have my word, Bunny. Call me when they get here. They coming? They are never gonna bring your kids here. He gave me his word. I can see them! They're here! Told you. Arsehole. Fuckin' arsehole. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit. Oh, he lied. Shit. Shit. Bunny? Tonyah's parents are here. They're very worried. All they want is their little girl home safe. Please, can you give us a sign that Tonyah is safe? I'll go and have a word with them. I'll do it. Ton. It's OK, Bunny. I'll speak to them. Suspect still has one hostage inside. Do not approach the girl. Ton. Baby, we've been so worried about you. Ton? Darling? You never even asked me if it was true. Come and eat something. Come on, Bunny. Bunny? Bunny, I know how important Reuben and Shannon are to you. But it's our job to keep them safe. Now, I want you to listen very carefully. There are only two ways that this can end. Either you come out peacefully, or we are coming in. You have 15 minutes. Oh, kia ora. It's Trish Reihana from GFS. I need to speak to the King children, please. We don't have very long. - Hello? - Reubs. Mum? I found you. They moved us again. Probably me, eh? Fights at school. I'm so stupid. I'm sorry. It's my fault they moved you. I stuffed up. I tried real hard to do the birthday for Shan,... but I kinda fucked up. Shame. Nah. No shame. Maybe next year? Yeah. Next year, eh? Next year, eh, Reubs? Yeah. We had a really nice day. I made Shan a cake. I love you, Mum. Oh, Reubs. Reuben?

Movement at the front door. Three persons, all female. - Positive ID on Trish Reihana. - Affirmative. Stay behind me. I'll go first. I have a partial clear. I'll see you real soon. I wish I could drive into a new life. Suspect reaching for a weapon. Don't move! Don't move! - Show me your fucking hands! - Bunny! - Move! - Bunny! - Coming through! - Bunny! Bunny! Clear! - Clear! Clear! - Stay down, Bunny. Stay down. - Hi, Bunny. - Fuck! I'm not the police. I'm here to help you out. - OK? - Oh... You have a single gunshot wound to your left shoulder. He missed my heart. He did. Oh, fuck. They fucking shot me. Girl, your back window's filthy. Shame. Just going to cut through your clothing to get to this wound. Aw, man, that's my good bra. You're hilarious. I... I... I think I might just have a... a little sleep. O2. See if you can stay awake for me, Bunny. Mm. I need you to keep fighting, hon. OK? Yeah. That's the one. You're a fighter. I can tell you are. Oh, yeah.
