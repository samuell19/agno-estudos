SCHOOLGIRL REPORT 9 MATURE BEFORE GRADUATION I can barely walk in a straight line! I can't believe how much alcohol we drank! Man, I'm drunk as a skunk! I'm glad Karl is driving. Slide over! I want the front seat! Buckle up, guys! Let's go! Put the pedal to the metal! Come on! Step on it! - Go faster! - Faster! Speed up! Go faster! Check it out, man. He's trying to pass us with his old piece of junk. Go faster! He's going to outrun us! Go! Stay on him! Don't let him get away! I'll show you who's faster! Hey! Stay in your lane! You hear me? It's like riding a roller coaster! Hey! Watch what you're doing! I'm trying to pass! Watch out!! Stop! "I was able to pull my car away... ...and drove straight into a tree." Well, Mr. Albert, the passengers in the second car... ...which ended up in the gravel pit... It's a miracle there wasn't more damage. Two passengers seriously injured, but no fatalities? I guess luck was on your side. Well, sometimes fortune favors fools. So, let's continue. "And then, by mere chance... ...a cyclist came by who informed the police." "I hereby agree to take a blood test... ...to determine my blood alcohol content." Is that correct as is, or would you like to add something? - No. - Then sign here. That's it. This is the last statement. We'll have to do the others at the hospital... ...as soon as the injured have recovered enough to be questioned. All right. You're free to go now. - What a bunch of crap! - I could use a drink! They're going to raise hell when I get home! I can already see the headlines. "Drunken youths engage in car race on country road." "Serious auto accident!" And so on and so forth. Thank God it wasn't as bad as it could have been. So it seems, at least. If it were up to me, Eckart... ...they'd get their asses whipped until they were black and blue! It's the only way to keep these delinquents in line! I don't know. You shouldn't jump to conclusions. - Haven't you had enough of this? - No. What good are a few pieces of paper? What do we really know about these youngsters? Well, I've certainly had enough. Look at this, it's unbelievable. Petra Klassmann, age 18. Profession: student. Marital status: divorced. Give me a break, Eckart. Divorced? It must be a typo, right? - It goes in right here. - Hurry up, already! Attention! Here she comes! - Quiet! - Looks pretty, eh? Yes. Children! What's all the noise about? Hey! Are you crazy? Enough, already! Long live the bride! Attention! May I have some discipline, please? And everything was going so well. Can someone explain the meaning of this nonsense here? Wedding-eve party, or wedding morning, to be more precise. And? Are you saying that one of you... ...is about to enter the holy state of matrimony? Yes. I am, sir. Really? How interesting! And when? Today, after fourth period. A civil wedding, sir. I've been excused from physics class. Remarkable. Quite remarkable. May I ask whether the groom is still attending our school as well? - No. He's a professional. - Is that so? Doing what? He's an auto mechanic. How nice. Then you'll be of great help to him with your skill in physics. You've hit the nail on the head, sir. That's exactly what we've planned. Good for you. - My congratulations. - Thank you very much, sir. In this remarkable and heartwarming event... ...I see an interesting topic for a short essay. Please open your notebooks. By the way, Petra... ...tell me... Yes, sir? How old are you? I turned 18 last month. Congratulations! Our subject matter is... "Age of majority at 18: My responsibilities as a mature citizen in a democratic society." - What stupid nonsense! - Silence, please! I suggest you'd do better to save your meager ideas for your essay. You have 45 minutes. One last question, Petra. What do your parents say about all this? Exactly the same thing you're thinking, sir! If I understand you correctly... ...there's absolutely nothing we can do at this point? Okay. Thanks anyway. Goodbye. Well, there's nothing we can do. Petra is of legal age. She can do whatever she wants. We have to get used to the idea. Here she comes. But she's much too young. She's still going to school! She's still a child! That man... You're referring to our future son-in-law. Hello! Well, then... goodbye. As soon as Horst and I are back from our honeymoon... ...I'll pick up the rest of my things. Take care. Do you even have a flat, yet? Yes, it's a little small, but it will do for now. After your wedding... I mean, if you plan on having a small party... ...we would love to stop by. There won't be a party. We'll leave right after the ceremony. You've always had something against Horst. You can't start acting as if nothing has happened... ...especially not by throwing a party. Although we don't approve of your choice or your actions... ...we nevertheless wish you all the best. I know, father. We're not moving to the moon. Just a moment, please. That's it. Thank you. Just one more picture, please. - Here you go, ma'am. - Thank you. Have a good trip. - Ciao! - Bye! A small schnapps to celebrate. Have some, please. - No, thank you. - No, thank you. Take a look at the bed. You'll be very pleased. Neither too soft nor too hard. And very sturdy. And here is the bathtub, and the toilet is over there. Do you like it? Very nice. Thank you. I'm so glad you like it. So, if there's anything else I can do for you... No, I don't think so. Well, I hope you saved a special wish for the wedding night. Yes, but it doesn't include you. That's a good one! I was thinking of my dear Alois... ...God bless him! Yes, yes. I understand, madam innkeeper. You don't understand anything! He was drunk, my Alois! On our wedding night! Drunk as a fish! And he fell right to sleep! Can you imagine? The morning after my wedding night... ...I was still a virgin, just as I had been! But I trust you no longer are. No, I read him the riot act, and he took it to heart. I see. You see nothing! He took it to heart so much... ...that he got drunk again! So on the second morning I was still a virgin! But on the third night... Finally! My words exactly! Oh my... and then he died, my Alois! What? On the third night? No! 30 years later. Cirrhosis of the liver. Well, we'd really like to be alone now. I understand. I understand. I'm already gone. That was enough to ruin one's appetite. Well, I hope not! Do you think I should have tipped her? Nonsense! She's the innkeeper. You only tip employees. I see. At least we got rid of her. What I would give to be young again! Mine were as pretty as hers... ...40 years ago. Oh well, those were the days! You're kidding me! What are those? Pajamas, can't you tell? - I bought them just for tonight! - What for? Well, since we're married now... You must have a screw loose! Come on, little boy! Hurry up and take these off! Here comes the money shot! Now... get to it! She sure has a nice little ass. Mine wasn't bad, either. Damned light! - Leave it on! Come to me! - Where's the switch? Huh? What do they want from me? Do you good people want something? We pushed the buttom by mistake. - We're sorry. - No problem. Don't let me disturb you. You can't even lock the door! So what? We're married! And this is our honeymoon! I completely forgot to bring your towels. I just remembered... Just act as if I weren't here. Oh well... Come, sweetheart. I don't feel like it anymore. The wedding night was a bust. He used to be a lot less uptight... Things got better at home... even without the pajamas! But only when I asked for it. Yes, what is it? - I can't sleep. - You can't sleep? No. Guess why your wife can't sleep! What are you doing now? Are you coming or not? My God! No, I can't! I told you already! You should know by now that tonight is our weekly bowling night. My friends aren't good enough for you, eh? Just drop this shit already! I don't know why you're still going to that stupid school anyway! But I know! And if you don't get it... ...don't start that same bullshit all over again! I do get it! You want to be something better than me! You must worry that I don't earn enough! You're a hopeless fool. Fuck this shit! Should I run after him now? How come things between us aren't the way they used to be? Why am I constantly asking myself whether we're even a good match? Hey, Horst! Hello! What? You're already here? 5:00 on the dot, and you're not done yet. No, and I can't leave, either. I'm sorry. Why can't you leave? This car belongs to an important customer. I have to finish it today. - I promised. - How long will it take? Well... another four or five hours. Are you crazy? We were going to the movies! There's no way. Some other time. You can't expect me to wait five hoursfor you! But waiting for the money I make? That doesn't seem to be a problem! You shouldn't have said that. No, I don't like that. Do you only know one position? Stop it! It's so vulgar like that! I... I don't like it this way! Horst! Hello, Petra! I can't believe you have the nerve to look me in the face! My God! You can get used to anything! Don't tell me you're going to run after her! Let go of me! After all, she is my wife. You stay... You didn't want to come. I had to prepare a presentation for school. Always that fucking school! It's not going to spoil my Sunday! No! You'd rather get drunk with your so-called colleagues! That isn't the kind of man I want. And you're far from the kind of woman I want! Watch out! She's coming! Take your places! So test, therefore, those who've joined forever... ...and maybe they'll find someone better... So, what's this all about? Did Mrs. Klassmann become a mother? Today, at 11:30, our Petra is scheduled to get a divorce. She will be available again, Mr. Teacher! You know, this is your greatest asset... ...you're always good for a surprise. If I wanted to be unkind, I would say that I saw it coming. Exactly what my parents said. Yes, yes. But the youth of today don't accept the advice... ...of parents or other more experienced people. If we didn't make mistakes in our youth... ...what would we look back on in our old age? You know, that must be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. Whatever you say. I was paraphrasing Goethe. Well, my dear Horst, we're divorced now. I guess marriage wasn't as easy as we thought it would be. - What are your parents... - Good thing we realized it in time. - ...saying about the divorce? - Can't you guess? But they're not criticizing me. I think that's very decent of them. Well, Horst, I guess... By the way, a friend invited me to a party this Saturday. He thinks i should celebrate my divorce and bring a fabulous girl. Would you like to go? Me? You've got to be kidding! Why not? It could be fun. A farewell party! Well, okay then. Stop by and pick me up. - So, I'll see you Saturday. - See you Saturday. - Bye. - Bye, take care. You too... The party was at a secluded hunter's cabin in the woods. Very suspicious! You see? Nothing but schoolgirls! I'm telling you, it was an outrageous orgy! Here, for example: Tessy Van Straaten... ...19 years old, student... ...attended with her boyfriend, Paul Bellmann, 21 years old. Profession: painter. It's obvious what happened! Why? What happened? You'll have to ask Tessy in person. Well, since you asked me... ...I'm not short on experience when it comes to orgies. There's a girl in our class called Lilo. Her parents are filthy rich, and seldom home. We always envied Lilo because she could do whatever she wanted. I have no idea how many guys she's slept with. One time she came up with this great idea... So tell me, is this going to be a real sex orgy... ...where everyone will be naked? Do you think I'd host a prayer session? Girls, this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! My parents will be gone on a trip again... ...and our maid will be staying with a niece who's about to give birth. So we have the house to ourselves! So, what do you say? Are you in? - Yes, I'm in! - There's no harm in giving it a try. Group sex? I'm not sure... Come on, Tessy, don't be such a prude! You're one hot chick! Well, okay... No one will force you if you don't like any of the boys. Actually, I didn't really want to go. I'd never had sex before. I was still a virgin. The truth is, I was afraid I'd make a fool of myself. Now, of all times, I ran into Paul. Paul Bellmann, a classmate of mine. He was a bit older... ...because he was held back a couple of years before he joined out class. Therefore we were often mean to him. - Hi, Tessy. - What are you doing here, Pauli? Please don't call me Pauli! I need to talk to you. All right. What's going on? Why are you planning on going to Lilo's party? That's none of your business! Maybe it is. - You must be nuts! - You don't belong there! I don't want them to turn you into a whore! Knock it off, Paul! First, I won't be turned into a whore. Second, this is entirely my business. And third, you don't have the right to be preaching morality! I'm not preaching. I just want to stop you from doing something stupid... ...that you'll regret for the rest of your life! Oh, God help us! For all I care, you can have as much sex as you want in private. But a sex orgy? Yuck! You have no idea what they may do to you! I'm not a little child anymore! - No! But you're a fool! - And you're an idiot! Hi, darling! Do you want to get it on? Maybe later. I don't feel like it right now. - Don't be a drag, girl! - No! - Hey! Come on, let's do it! - Yeah! Suddenly, I couldn't believe my eyes! I brought more alcohol for the punch. - Where's the bar? - That way. You can't miss it. Hello! Don't mind me. I'm just filling the punch bowl. Hey, Lilo, what's Paul doing here? Are you crazy? Why did you invite him? Why not? He came with Stefan. Is there a problem? What a bunch of duds! Who's going to do the first striptease? - How about our hostess, eh? - Yes! Perfect! Okay, okay! But everyone else must follow my lead! - Yes! - Of course! Here goes! Get out of the way! And put on a record that sets the right mood! Hot! - Bravo! - Keep going! - That's it! - Perfect! It's even better than I imagined! First class! - Bravo! - Great! - Bravo! - Yes! - She's fantastic, right? - Absolutley! - Hi, Tessy! - Oh, piss off! Refreshments, ladies and gentlemen! - Cheers! - Fantastic! - Have a drink, please? - Yes! Come... - Now everyone, take off your clothes! - Exactly! - Strip more slowly! - Come on, you too! - Lilo, come with me. - Yes? I see you didn't take my advice, Tessy. So you noticed. Other than that, you can kiss my ass! I'll that a raincheck on that! Cheers! Well, what now? Still feeling a little shy? Is that what you've been waiting for, you pig? Yes, of course! I warned you. Now you'll have to join in! You disgusting pervert... I don't know why... I... feel... so... horny... Just like that I passed out. Lights out. Finito. Paul told me later what actually happened. I have this sinking... feeling... Fuck me. Fuck... When I woke up, I was disoriented. I had no idea where I was. Good morning, Tessy. Did you sleep well, Tessy? How did I get here? Did you undress me? Yes, of course I undressed you. What did you do to me last night? Well, what do you think? I seduced you. You gave in to your all-consuming passion! My son is just messing around with you. Good morning, Miss Tessy. Don't worry, it was I who undressed you. I couldn't allow you to sleep in that tight dress. So? How about a strong cup of coffee now? It'll do you good. Yes. But what happened? Well... it might be better if Paul fills you in. You wouldn't listen to me. So I had to use a bit of force. I knocked everyone out with a massive dose of sleeping pills. By the way, it was my mother's idea. Stop acting silly. I've seen a naked woman before. Why did you do it, Paul? I mean... the sleeping pills. Just think about it, Tessy. Okay! Get dressed now. I'll take you home. Paul? Thank you. I'm sure you'd like to know what went on at the villa... ...after Paul had taken me home. Well, I wasn't actually there, but I heard about it later. You can probably picture it yourself... ...when Lilo's parents came home later that night. Don't be so noisy, Hubert! You'll wake up the child. It's not easy closing the door with two suitcases in my hands! - At least be quiet in the house. - Yes, yes, I'll do my best. Lilo sleeps like a groundhog anyway. Okay, I think I'll have a drink first. - What happened? - Ouch! Goddammit! - What happened? I fell! - Did you hurt yourself? - Turn on the light already! Actually, something softened my fall... Hubert! What's going on here? I wouldn't mind an answer to that myself! I think... we're in the wrong... ...house. This can't be real! Nothing! It looks like they're all dead! The pulse... For God's sake! They've been poisoned! Hubert! A crime has happened here! We have to call the police! Lilo! Where is Lilo? Where is she? - My little Lilo! - No! That's not her! - My dear Lilo! - Over there? My little Lilo! Here she is! - Yes? - My little Lilo! Lilo! What's wrong with you, my child? I'm calling the poli... the poli... the police! Lilo, what's wrong with you? What did they do to you, my poor child? Hello? Hello? Hello, Constable? Linden Boulevard 14. Please come at once! Mass poisoning! Multiple homicides! Please bring all available ambulances! Yes! Please! Please! Hurry! Hubert! She's still alive! Water! Get some water! Yes! Right away! Oh, little Lilo! What have you done to us? You should have kept a closer eye on that child! I still can't believe what I'm... seeing... Hubert! District police station. Constable Eckart. What was that name again? Susanne Strohmeyer? Yes, she's one of the injured. We only have the statement of her friend, a certain... Elke Parsberg. Ah! Elke Parsberg! Ah! You want her to come to the hospital... ...and ask for Dr. Franke. Yes, I will take the appropriate action and send Elke Parsberg. Goodbye. Yes, what is it? Miss Parsberg is here to see you, Doctor. She says you asked her to come here. - Parsberg? - Correct. Show the young lady in. Mr. Strohmeyer, I'll notify you as soon as your daughter regains conciousness. - If you would excuse me now. - One question, Doctor... ...regarding Miss Parsberg. Why do you want to talk to her? Well, she's a friend of your daughter. She was present at the party as well as the accident. Perhaps she can shed some light on your daughter's condition. I can't imagine how... Miss Parsberg. If you please. - Well then, I'll say goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye. Please, Miss Parsberg, have a seat. Mr. Strohmeyer is not Susanne's father. No. Susi's father died about five years ago. Her mother continued to manage the business... ...and married one of her employees, Mr. Stromeyer, two years ago. You don't like Susanne's stepfather. No, I don't. - Is that somehow related to Susanne? - Yes. Can you tell me the reason? Well... okay. There was an incident... I was visiting Susi. It was in the evening. We had talked for a while, and I was just about to leave. What's this all about? Give me that! - But why? I want to see it! - No! Come on! Give it to me! Let me have at look at it! Elke, you're being nasty! What's the big deal? Sometimes I enjoy looking at stuff like this, myself. Where did you get it? I bought it at the newspaper stand. Well, that is something! Elke... ...have you ever seen something like that? I mean, the real thing? Of course! Are you saying you actually... ? ...had sex? Yes, many times! You know Albert, right? - Albert? He... - You bet he did! Tell me, what does it feel like when a man's thing is inside you? Elke! What are you doing? Showing you how Albert did it to me! Oh, that's so good! Well, what a lovely picture you make! Unbelievable! What a shameful scene! Are you so completely depraved... ...as to roll around in here like a couple of pigs? What am I supposed to do with you now? According to the law, you should be locked up. First, I forbid any further contact with each other. You, my dear Elke, are no longer welcome here. I'll let your parents know. Did he actually do that? Thank God, he didn't. Susi's father had forbid any contact... ...but we contined to meet, secretly. And Susi tells me everything. Then... perhaps you can tell me who got your friend pregnant. For God's sake! You must abort the child! The father must not know! Under no circumstances can she have the child! Why? After all, it's simply a natural process. Not in this case! Listen, Elke, if you want me to help your firend... ...you have to talk to me now. So, what happened? Back then, Susi stayed out of her parents' sight all day. She was afraid of being punished. On the following morning... - Good morning, mom. - Good morning, Susi. You're late today! I don't think I have time for breakfast today. Nonsense! You have plenty of time for breakfast. It's only 7:30. Come on, coffee's ready. What's the matter, child? Aren't you feeling well? I'm okay, mom. - Are you worried about something? - Yeah... I think I have a math test today. All the more reason to start the day with a good breakfast. Come on, I've poured your coffee. Susi was surprised that her stepfather... ...had apparently not told her mother what had happened. Good morning, everyone. Well, Susi my child, is everything all right? She's just a little worried about a math test today. Well, let's hope you're well prepared. But you spent plenty of time... May I have the butter, please? You spend a lot of time with Elke... ...studying. And I can see... that Elke is quite valuable to you... ...as a tutor. Later on in the day, Susi went to take a shower. Her stepfather always locked the door... ...when he was in the bathroom. I'm sorry. Well, I guess you got a good look at it, sweetheart! I didn't know you were in there, and the door wasn't locked. My God! I completely forgot! It doesn't matter. After all, you're not a little girl anymore. Your friend Elke must have taught you a few things, eh? Please, father, don't! I'm not your father! You're well aware of that. What do you think I'm going to do with you? I don't know. But if mother were to come in now... Your mother's at work! She's always at work. But you... you are here! - You little fox! - Father... Wolfgang, what are you doing to me? Better you should ask what you're doing to me! Susi! For months, I've been watching you grow ever more beautiful. The way you walk around in these dresses... ...little dresses that show your bare legs. It's impossible for a man to just look. Susi! But I thought... ...you were so mad at me last night! Because you were doing it with a girl... ...with your friend. That's disgusting! - Do you want your mother to find out? - No! Please! He blackmailed her several times this way. And Susi never had the courage to tell her mother about it. Until she found out for herself one day. Please... don't do it! Don't be such a prude! Wolfgang! What... But... This is impossible! Oh well! She's your daughter! I present you with your daughter - the way she really is! Who would have thought? Just look at her! A cheap little whore! Just a few days ago I caught here in bed... ...having sex with Elke! Picture this, both of them completely naked... ...going at it like a pair of rabbits! Say hello to the lesbian! I haven't said anything until now because I wanted to know... ... how far she would go. How much farther she'd push it! All right. Now you've seen it with your own eyes. Girls or guys - it doesn't matter to her! Susi! Please look at me! Is this true? Just ask Elke! My God! What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to go on? Calm down! You know what? We can send her to a boarding school. Or, if you prefer, a reform school. What am I supposed to do? And our marriage, Wolfgang! What does this have to do with our marriage? Just because your daughter is a ... My God! She's still going through puberty. Stop it! So, your friend is pregnant with a child from her stepfather. An intervention is ethically possible. But this is for a committee to decide... ...and then the entire story would come out. I know a crime's been committed. But do you want to see Susi's stepfather in jail... ...a marriage fall apart... ...and the whole case turn into a media spectacle? But this situation must not be allowed to go on! He'll be after her again and again! Susi swears that he never tried again after that day. Please give me a little time, Elke. I need to give this some more thought. I need to square this with my conscience. Neither a theologian nor an attorney would be any help. I'm convinced that the people who went to the party... ...were all couples, anyway. I'm sure you have lots of experience with that, Eckart. Unfortunately not. Cops are never invited to these things. Exactly! The only time we're holding hands involves a pair of handcuffs! My aunt is very cool. She'd never come into my room without knocking. And Nick coming over in the afternoons... ...to help with my homework doesn't bother her at all. Bravo! "Happy." "Happy three times and more... ...are those for whom love holds no unbroken bonds." Even old Horace preferred the practice over the theory. Katja! Telephone! It's your papa. Okay, Auntie, I'll be right there. Parents always interrupt just when the fun starts! Hi, papa! How are you? Are you calling for a particular reason? I see. Well, if you think so, and you're sure you want me to. Yes, of course we want you to come, Katja. It goes without saying that you'd be here... ...for our 20th wedding anniversary! And if you think it'll be too boring with us old-timers... ...then bring your boyfriend along. Yes, we're looking forward to it. - Ciao, my girl! - And... ? She's coming, and she's bringing her stallion with her! Her stallion? Her boyfriend! You still haven't worked through the encyclopedia of teen language? No wonder you don't get along with your daughter! What's gotten into you today? Well, I admit, Selma... ...maybe I've been a little too authoritarian. But that's all about to change. Katja will be in for a surprise tomorrow... ...when she sees what a youthful father she has! If you want to understand your child, you must speak the same language. I don't know. Somehow, I'd feel foolish. That's completely normal. There's no need to be self-conscious. You just need to motivate yourself. - I have to do what? - Well, yes. Here we go! Come on! Look sharp! To the side! Yeah! We've got the right moves! Now zigzag! - But... listen! - Get up! Hey, and 1, and 2, and 3... ...and now over the back! Where did you go? Oh... here! And now, come here, and up... ...and 1, and... Ow... my back! But I... I'm warning you... ...if we act like this tomorrow... ...our daughter will say we have bats in our belfry! Our daughter would never say that. She'd more likely say... Just a second. "My folks must be tripping!" Or, put more elegantly... "They're one beer short of a six-pack!" Listen. Then I'd let the child know... Selma, you have to get used to the fact... ...that our Katja isn't a child anymore. Today, you'd call her a fun-loving chick! What? If you refer to your child, your own flesh and blood... ...in such unflattering terms... ...then you are ... you are... ...The Doctor! And if you don't believe it, I'll give you a good check-up! Well, darling, no matter how difficult it may be... ...we'll get used to speaking the same language as our child. - Yeah... yeah... - Oh, by the way! We'll have to adopt her style of dress as well. Just a moment. After my father's phone call... ...we got right back to work! Back to the love poems of ancient Horace. Slower, Katja! Slower! Otherwise... I'll come too soon! We're finished with the tutoring... The tutoring... Come now... ...I enjoy this kind of tutoring! If old Horace could see this! I love higher education! Oh... I'm coming... I'm coming... ...closer to understanding my homework! - Oh, yes! - Come... Come! Honestly... we enjoyed a fantastic collaboration that afternoon... ..and got a lot of work done! But still... something had spoiled the mood. What's the matter, Katja? I'm a bit queasy, thinking about having to go home tomorrow. It could be worse. You don't know my parents. They're complete squares... ...and they never have the slightest sympathy for me. - And the worst part is ... - The worst part is what? They want me to bring you along! All this to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary! That's it? Then it won't be a problem pleasing them. I always wanted to be part of a real family get-together! Yes? Go, Otto! Turn up the woofer! Here they come! I'll give you woofer, fly girl! Yeah! Here we go! Hey there! Come in, you two! Oh man, what a blast! We're so glad you came! Have you both gone insane? No! Progressive and anti-authoritarian! My Christmas tree is screaming bonanza! Just look at you two! How am I supposed to respect parents like this? Don't act so bitchy, baby! We don't care about respect. We're down with the youth of today... and what have you. We're not uptight. We're modern parents! We've changed with the changing times. The only thing is, you're stuck in the wrong time period. You see... there's been a major change in the trend. Why are you coming down on our progressive attitudes? I'd rather drink four-twenty! Cheers! Cheers! Four-twenty? What's all this nonsense you're saying? What's the point? What's the point? That's hip teen talk, you bitchy chick! Your father even bought a teen encyclopedia! We're modern parents - totally up to date! Sounds like a misprint to me. Nobody actually talks like that! You're one beer short of a six-pack! Teen encyclopedia, page 25! We just wanted prove to you that we're modern parents... ...who are open to just about anything! That's exactly the problem! I want parents who know what they want... ...and not a couple of buffoons! But... that would make us authoritarian! So what? I guess you forgot... ...a little spanking at the right time can be a good thing! Come on, Mick! This is ridiculous! Let's get out of here! But children! You just... Oh man... that idea backfired! Yeah... you and your stupid teen encyclopedia! You heard it yourself - a major change in the trend! Stop barking at me, you uptight bitch! You must be tripping! Oh man, you're... you're one beer short of a six-pack! Uncool! Just put another record on. Calm down, Katja. It wasn't all that bad. I actually thought it was rather funny. You're not the one who's ashamed of your parents. Just a moment, Katja! Let me tell you something. You should never be ashamed of your parents, and... I, for one, thought your parents were very nice. You wouldn't be here if not for them. Hello, Katja! I haven't seen you in ages! Where have you been? We went to a party, but it was a total bust. I'm on my way to a party which hopefully won't be a bust. Would you like to come? Mick, this is Albert. He used to go to our school. And this is Mick! He's a classy guy! That's great! So, are you coming? Sure. Why not? Pardon me. One of them is in critical condition? Just a second, I'm taking notes. Forster, Achim... 18 years old. Student. He was brought to the hospital... Punctured lung, internal bleeding, et cetera, et cetera. Well, these are the results! Well, thank you. Bye. Forster, Achim. The boy is obviously some kind of maverick. He had no one with him. It's all my fault, and only my fault. It wouldn't have happened if I had just given in. He wouldn't be in such bad shape. You have to leave now, Miss Claudia. We have to prepare for surgery now. Please, leave now. Everything will be all right. And it all started out so beautifully... Must be nice to be in love! No need to be jealous! You'll age prematurely. Come on, Claudia. How much time do you have? The whole afternoon. Mom's on a big shopping spree. Fabulous! Let's go! Hey, what's going on? - You'll find out soon enough! - Stop running! - Catch me if you can! - I'm going to get you! My God, I'm thirsty! I'll get something to drink. Why do you need a drink? - Here, I brought you a drink. - Oh, that's great! - But I'd rather to go for a swim. - Swim? There are some swim trunks in there. - Swim trunks? - Yes. Can't we swim naked? No, not with me! Go on, change. Hey, Claudia? I've never seen you naked. I hope your breasts aren't down to your knees! But I don't think so. I bet you have a great figure! Can I help you? Hey, what are you doing? Stop that! Achim, please stop it! No! Let me go! Achim! Please, stop it! You're being rude! I don't want to. Hey! Just wait, I'll get you! You won't get rid of me so easily! Now I have you! - No! - Hey! You're a bastard! A nasty bastard! It's unfair to take advantage of me like that! Claudia! Wait! Silly little bitch! I was even angrier with myself. Whenever Achim went too far... ...and he had already tried it several times... ...something snapped inside me. Every time! Since that terrible incident back then... I was on my way back from my violin lesson. The park was deserted. I only saw a man in the distance... ...who suddenly disappeared into the bushes. I don't know why, but I walked straight towards the spot... ...where the man had disappeared. I was excited, and terribly curious... ...about what the man was doing there. He was an exhibitionist who had strapped on an artifical penis. - Hi, Claudia. - Leave me alone. Come on. Stop being mad at me! I know what I did was unfair. You know nothing. You're all talk. Don't you understand me at all? Sometimes it's easy to get carried away! What's the point of having such a beautiful girlfriend? Do you promise you won't try again to... I promise. I give you my word. All right then. Let's forget about it. Great! You know I love you? You know, when I'm ready to go there, I'll tell you. - Understand? - I understand. "I am unhappy." Past tense? "I am happy." Past tense? Shit! Forget it! I'm done for now. I have to go now! Yes... but why, Claudia? We still have time. No... I have things to do. I have to go home. I have lots to prepare for tomorrow. Then leave, already. I'm staying here. Don't worry, I'll leave... - Bye, Helmut! - Be on time tomorrow, all right? - Okay, bye! - Bye! - Bye, Claudia! - Bye! Can I catch a ride with you? Why? Do you have time for me now? Don't act like a prima donna! You don't have a reason. You must be kidding! Can I ride with you or not? Yeah... if you insist. I don't insist. Only if you want me to. I'm actually pretty mad at you. Yes? You're weird! When are your parents coming back? Later tonight. And if they hit bad traffic, they won't be home before midnight. Do you want something to drink? What do you have? Whatever you want. I'm raiding the bar. Then I'll have a whiskey and Coke. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Let's drink to our reconciliation. - Cheers! That's what you call a reconciliation kiss? You've got to be kidding! You're smothering me! It can't be that bad! Let me put on a record. What do you want to hear? It doesn't matter. Anything. Achim, no! Please don't! Why? I'm just not ready yet. Maybe later... But not right now. Why won't you let me? Maybe I'll get you to the point where you want it, too. - Achim! Please don't! - Please, let me try! I told you I don't want to do it! Leave me alone! No, I don't want to! Don't you understand? No, I really do not! Why should I try to understand your hangups? Have you made any effort to understand me? Achim... I'm done with this bullshit! For good! I've been invited to a party tonight. I didn't want to go because of you. Achim! Please stay! I want to go now more than ever! And I'm sure I'll meet a girl. A real girl. Do you understand? Not some little tease like you! He only went to the party because I rejected him. And he was right. If you're really in love, you don't reject your partner. Why can't I get over this stupid hangup? How stupid! How terribly stupid! I do love him! Why have I realized that only now, when it may well be too late? Dear God, please let him live! I'll make up for everything! Everything! You really have to leave now. If it will put you at ease, I just heard the head surgeon say... ...that it's not too serious. Just a routine procedure. So don't worry unnecessarily. I'm telling you, these accident reports are like a puzzle. The young men are part of a rather mixed group. Whereas all the girls are still going to school! So why is that a big deal? We all went to school once. Some longer than others. You didn't go very long, did you? One of these guys doesn't have any profession at all! There are lots of unemployed youth nowadays. But what is a guy like that doing at a party? Why shouldn't he go? One of the girls probably brought him with her. Yes... here. Maybe it was Monika Schmieding. 18 years old. Student. Yes, of course! Zeller, satisfactory. Liebich. You did very well. Renate. Good plus. Kranzler. You should have tried harder. Schmieding. Insufficient. I really should have given you "unsatisfactory". I didn't turn one, but two blind eyes. How are you doing in your other subjects? Unfortunately, pretty poorly, Dr. Seidel. You don't have a single subject to balance things out? Your graduation is more than at risk. And you've already taken this class twice. - You know what that means? - I'm afraid I do. I'll have to drop out of school. You could certainly continue at a private school. My parents can't afford that. There is another possibility, Monika. If you decide to withdraw from school voluntarily... ...the council would be willing to turn a blind eye... ...and award you a general certificate of secondary education. Why don't you discuss that with your parents, okay? So this guy, I assume he's your boyfriend, right? - Yes he is! - I see! And what does he have? What is he? What are his skills? I'm a reasonable father. I don't have anything against a steady boyfriend at your age. But why this bum? I don't like him at all! Maybe he just can't find a job? Nonsense! It's because he's too stupid and too lazy! You know these impudent brats. They do nothing, but demand everything! And it's the state's responsibility to care of these brats! No! The state just makes sure its officials make enough! You stay put! I decide when someone leaves the table! The world could have been yours... ...if you had finished school. Especially during the numerus clausus. Peter, be quiet when your father is talking! Nothing's a problem when you have good credentials. As an official, I know what I'm talking about. But that's not good enough for Monika, is it? The best thing for you would be to get married. But, befitting your rank, I owe that to myself. What's the matter, Moni? I'm sorry, I don't really know. I'm having problems at school, as well as with my parents. What do you want me to say? I can't sleep at night... ...because I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent on this shack! You still haven't found anything? Nothing. Since my leather business went bust... ...bad luck follows me wherever I go. For a while it was going pretty well. Yeah... for my partner! He stole my money, and I went bankrupt. - Sounds good, huh? - And now? Everyone gives me the runaround... ...and there's always a line out the door at the employment office. Even the academies! I can't even draw unemployment because I was self-employed. Yeah, self-employed. Shit! Listen... I have to quit school now. And if I'm able to find a job, maybe we could make it together. It has to be easier together, don't you think? You're a hopeless idealist. You know I love you, Moni. But marry you? Marry you... now? I'm not that irresponsible! Don't you want to know who's calling? Just someone who wants money from me. Hello? Oh, it's you, Albert! A party? No, honestly, I'm not in the mood. You never do! Thanks for thinking of me. Okay. Bye! Who was it? That was Albert, an old school friend. He also dropped out of school after 10th grade. But he doesn't have any problems! How come? Albert is junior director at his father's company. And he can't do anything for you? Of course he could! But Albert has never done anything in his life... ...without getting something in return. And I don't have anything to offer. Yes, but... but did you at least give it a try? To be turned down with a friendly smile? No way! What if I talked to him? Don't you dare! If Albert saw you now... ...I'd probably have a job at his company tomorrow. You know, Albert is the greatest ladies' man I ever met. Good of him to change his mind and let you come, Monika. Karl is truly a grumpy old man! I only came to this party to talk to you, Albert. But not here, girl. We'll talk where we won't be disturbed. Downstairs. Hello? Can I speak to Monika, please? Who is this? Ah, Mr. Henschel. No, my daughter is not available. And especially not for you! In fact, she's not at home. No, she's at a party at a friend's house. You're welcome. And for her I turned down an invitation to a party. I guess I can still check it out. Come on, Monika. I'll show you my room. What is it, girl? Come in! It's nice here. Well, what did you expect? Here's where I entertain my favorites. Come over here, girl. The bed is more comfortable. Hello, hello! - Can I catch a short ride with you? - Sure, get in! Are you going to Albert Warremeyer's? Yeah! Come here! You were pretty heavy! You want to see something? No! What's up, baby? You didn't come down here to tell fairy tales? No. So, why are you acting like this? How do you know Albert? I don't really know him. His father bought a painting of mine. He said his son was about my age, and so on and so forth. Anyway, we're here now. Just wait! I'll catch you! Go on in, young man. Hey Horst, do you know where Albert is? Albert? I guess he's busy. Busy? What's wrong with you, Monika? Are you frigid, or still a virgin? Well, say something! Have I done something wrong? - No, but... I can't! - Is that right? Just like that! Isn't this a little unfair? It is... I thought it would be easier. Tell me, what kind of an act are you putting on? I wanted... because Karl can't find a job anywhere... And I thought... You thought, "I'm going to hit on Albert." "I'll have sex with him... ...and he'll help Karl out because of it." You women are strange creatures! Oh well, you'd better get dressed. Let's just forget waht happened here, okay? And I promise you, I'll find something for Karl. Have you seen Albert? He was right here just a little while ago. I can't take the air in here! I'm going out to check on the horses. Monika! What are you doing here? I'm glad you were able to make it, Karl! Where were you? We were... We were outside. Getting some fresh air! You'll die in here. Where outside? We... we were talking about you, Karl. How dare you come here... ...without letting me know! It's because Monika is a very sensible girl. Tell me, old friend... ...why didn't you ever come to me to discuss your problems? It takes a nice girl... Of course I'll help you! Give me a call on Monday at the company. And I'm warning you... ...if you give Monika a hard time for coming here... ...I'll kick your ass! Now be good! Moni... How did you pay for that? What do you mean, pay? Don't act stupid! You know exactly what I mean! Nothing happened, Karl. I swear! Moni, I really hope that's that a false oath! If I find out otherwise, I promise I'll break his neck! You'll never have reason to. I can barely walk in a straight line! I can't believe how much alcohol we drank! Man, I'm drunk as a skunk! I'm glad Karl is driving. Slide over! - Let's go! - Stop! Stop! You kids, stop! You kids have to give us a ride. I have a flat and no spare tire. - Yeah, hop in! - Enter our nest! - Okay, get in, doll. - Thank you. Close the door, it's cold! - Faster! - Go! Oh, man! Watch out! They'll pass us! Go faster! Watch out! Oh well. 12 people in two cars! On top of that, a race between two drunk drivers! It wasn't going to end well! I'm telling you, Eckart, it's all the fault of the parents! This is nothing but the result of a completely wrong upbringing! Believe me! While they still had time, the parents failed... ...to give them a good spanking! Nothing works better than police methods! Why are you looking at me like that? If you... If you would look around... Hello, papa! Good evening! Christine! What are you doing here? Mama went to the morning service at church... ...and I went for a morning pint with Egon! You dare to show yourself in public like this? But, papa... I need to go pee! - First door on the left. - What? I've already forgotten... And she's only 17! Come on, let's go! Eckart, can you handle things here by yourself? I have a few things to take care of at home. Come on, already! Do schoolgirls have to behave like this? They act out like this in many different ways. But in most cases, they're much better people than their reputations would suggest. Their parents should learn to understand... ...that it isn't the young people who've changed, but rather the times... ...they live in, grow up in and have to mature in. Are police methods really the best thing?
