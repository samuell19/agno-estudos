PRIVATE TUITION Ketti Preparatory School No one enters the classrooms! Stay in the courtyard! Good morning. He's started. I'm not God... If Easter is in April this year... I can't be blamed. Are we agreed? First trimester, we realize our students don't know anything, in the second, we realize that we don't know anything, and in the third, a freak accident...our children cross the street, and what a shock! Entrance exams. Yet, we saw it coming. Each year, we pick up little corpses. You want figures? 1983: 46% pass rate. 1984: 44% and 1985: 41%. So, you want to know what our goal will be? To not drop under 40%. The bell rang, sir. I'm not done. Keep the pillowcase, I forgot it. Yes, yes. - No kiss? - When it's over. Still coming home Saturday? Of course. In prison... Unfortunately... We get visitors. So? Sartre? R?gis Debray. Nietzsche? Sade. No. Charles De Gaulle. War Memoirs You see how tricky it is, eh? Secondly... Prove that the triangle OAnAn+1" is rectangle... ...rectangle to On+1. Represent the points A0, A1 to A12 and trace segments OA0, OA1 up to OA12. Then, A0, A1... In Algeria, colonization lacks a specific situation. The direct appropriation of lands by the colonists... Which dispossesses Algerian peasantry, makes it an occupation... By the Europeans... Miss Kern, please see me between your classes. Get references for Miss Kern. We took them, they were fine. Ask Miss Kern what she does on weekends and at night. Frankly, she may do what she likes. Do you know what she imagines when looking at her students? You didn't answer. The answer is here. To pleasure them between their thighs with her tongue. That's disgusting. Disgusting? That's not enough my little Jeanne. Why you? Why here in my school? Have you thought about it? No. To pleasure them between their thighs with her tongue. I'll leave that to you, Miss Kern. Duquesne? Distribute the tests. What's this? It's for the new girl. Well, I won't say "See you tomorrow" since I'm not here tomorrow. Goodbye. What's the matter? Nothing, why? You didn't end up leaving at Easter. No. Dominic couldn't go? No, it was me. What's he like exactly? Who? Dominic. Younger than you, and doesn't ask questions. - Staying for dinner? - No. - Dominic? - Yes. Still going OK at Kitty? - It's Ketti, Mom. - Yes, alright. Will you finish out the year this time? He tried it again, is that it? No, but when you look at me like that, it's worse. Exaggerate much? - Oh, you're here. - How are you? Not staying? No. Dominic? Yes. You can bring your boyfriends, we won't eat them, you know. Are you sure about that? No. You don't need anything? No. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Is Dominic here? In his room. How is he today? Very bad mood. You know Dominic. How was he last time? Adorable. As usual. With you... At least. So, what score? Two. Give me. Did your parents see it? Yes. - Are they angry? - Yes. At me? A little, but you're not expensive, so... Your teacher's a bitch. Come on, let's start. Miss Zanon. Mr. Principal? So? Not too disoriented? No. Weren't you at Saint-Mathilde last year? Yes. With Miss Kern. So you're happy to find her here? Yes. That's all. ...imagine them naked, Mr. Principal, as if saying "yes" from all over. Her hips, her breast, her thighs, her lips... Her upper lips... Her... Should I go on? As you like. I don't want to. Well, doesn't this scare you? It's becoming a problem. There, finally. I prefer to get some reaction. Maybe not the best one. Tears are still silence. They don't tell me who, what, how. How should I know?! So she's not hungry, it's her own business! An espresso. Short. I don't know... A jealous lover? Some wife's revenge? Why revenge? You still have a problem, Jeanne. You're attractive. Too attractive. You're right, it's better than ours. So? I have my class. Go ahead. I didn't pay. No, put it away! Attractive people must be very careful. Paris --- Other Including Suburbs Where were you before? Put down the chalk. - Put it down. - At Saint-Mathilde. - You didn't learn this? - I did. So, not your best subject? Guess not. Jeanne? Going for a swim? What's his deal? What's that prick's deal?! - You're not breathing well. - We won't make it. Your swimsuit. Let's go, out of the water. What are you doing here? Swimming. With your students? Yes. Very well, then. Ah... The plot thickens. After words come images... First thing I noticed, they're very young, no? But it's cut out. Ah, you too. I wondered about that myself. A headless woman with this angel's body. Funny thing. The rest is interesting, but we notice only one thing... ...the absence of a face. Mine. Yes, exactly. It'd be better than any other. No, but we agree. It's any other, not yours. Well, now we can move forward. Do you know any of these young people? Look closely. None of them. None are from here, anyway. Yet, this always happens here. I'm feel sorry for you. Jeanne. You never wear a brassiere? No, why? You should. Jeanne? Yeah, they "read with great interest", and "will follow my writing career". Signed, illegibly, the Reading Committee. But they liked it. Yes, that's the 8th time they like and reject me. My wife says my novels are sweet are like cake: Tasty enough, but sticks in their teeth. If I understand correctly, You don't like our cafeteria's chicken? For once, it wasn't too dry. Don't hurry, I can wait for my coffee. I have bad news. The Zanon girl. Agn?s? Yes, Agn?s attempted suicide. How? Well, she left school in the afternoon, went home... She had pills hidden away, not enough, luckily. Semi-coma, ambulance, emergency room... Why do that? Where is she? At Cochin, intensive care. Shall I order coffee? - Well, I'm heading off. - Keep it quiet, alright? That's all we needed. What do you care? It wasn't at school, that's what matters to you, no? Maybe now there won't be more. More what? Letters. Photos. Why are you saying that? Senior Classrooms Here, it's for you. They're all the same, they must be ads. This is no ad. What is it exactly? An orgy. - Skirt. I win! - I quit betting. It looks good. The Duke of Edinburgh's role in the rise of National-Socialism. You have one hour. Can you guess what they were talking about? No. The photo. Didn't you get it? Yes. Does it arouse them? Mind you, it's not even really an orgy, they're not co-mingling. Too bad the photo is so small. Can't identify anyone. So, they all think it's me? Who else would they think? It sure isn't Madame Taxi, even less Madame Chaussin. - And you? - My version? "I don't think it's a teacher." We'll explain it that way. - Did you really try? - Yes. That was kind. - This way's better. - Learning anything? Hand me yours, please. Thank you. Anyway, if you never learned about this, there's no helping you now. Do you agree, Mr. Bonnier? Ladies. I'll grant you it wasn't Zanon. Why focus on me? It could be a student. No. Look closer, it's a fully-developed woman. And I forgot something. - What? - The letters. The photo, the letters... If it was you, you'd tell me? And if you told me, we'd get out of this. Both of us. It's not me and I don't want to be "us". Miss Kern. Yes? You're the history teacher? Yes. Come Christiane, let's go. Yes, I put myself in your shoes. History and geography class, next it'll be your children. I hope it wasn't Ludovic who opened the envelope. In my house, I open the mail. I hear you. Please note that none of the participants in this trash... Attend the Ketti School. That's why I asked you here, we'll go around the classrooms. No. But, the young woman? Difficult to put a name to a body. It's sensitive. No, it's a mistake. The photo has nothing to do with our establishment. Then, why did we receive it? We all got it! Everyone! All the teachers received it. All the parents, even me. Even me. Come with me. Things not going well? Not too well. I would have so liked for things to work out better. You know, I decided something. Nothing will happen to us. You just need... A bit of faith. - In whom? - In me. Ah, yes. Just like that. For my pretty face. I'm know that kind of faith, it never worked for me. There's a slight difference with me. Which one? I love you. Light's green. The rain stopped. That's something, at least. Jeanne! What? I seem to be making you uncomfortable. Yes. You shouldn't be. Hurry home. What would you like for dinner? Let me finish this first. I'm not hungry anyway. You really like that? Reheated with butter, it's not bad. He coughed! Once. Let's wait for a second one before calling the doctor. If that's alright. Yeah? Now? Where? Downstairs? Alright. 5 minutes. That was Kern, a teacher. Looks like there's a problem. I'm going down to the Chinese restaurant. I understood. I'll be back. I hope so. What's happening with you? That photo again, right? No, it's Ketti. He's in love with me. That's not news, everyone knows that. Yes, but now he's told me. What will I do? We'll figure it out. Can I make a phone call? To Ketti? To my wife. - Yes? - What are you doing? Correcting your papers. They're awful. - And you? - It's Kern. She's in big trouble. She? Yes, Kern. So, I'm grabbing a bite with her. Happy you got your appetite back. - Later. - Later. It all started when I was 12. I was happy when they looked at me from car windows. Then when I was 14, the cars would stop. Windows got rolled down. Then, it gets scary. At 16, one needs to be ready to run. Have good legs and plug your ears. By force, by fear, we want to be rid of it. So one day we get in the car. Just to see. See what? Nothing. Because it happens in a parking. In the dark. We can only hear. Dirty words. Filthy. We wait for it to be over. Then leave with a stain on our skirt. That's your hell. Hmm? Not far off. Listen, stop. Look at yourself. Physically you don't look like you hate it. And what's your complaint? How does Dominic manage? He doesn't. He doesn't exist, I made him up. Alright then. And me? Why did you call me? I needed it, probably. Which one's yours? Second floor. With the lights on. - Pink curtains? - Yep. She's waiting for you? Yes. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Miss? Yes? The bell rang. Yes, yes, you may go. Miss? Any news of Charvet? Is he sick? Go ask Ketti if Charvet's sick. I wanted to keep it from you. But since you already know... It happens. As a boy, when there were storms, I'd hide in a corner of my bed, under the comforter. From fear of being struck by thunder. Many times I risked... Suffocating. Sit down, little Jeanne. Now, I don't take chances. Charvet's parents pulled him from school, didn't they? In short... Yes. But... We won't panic for such a small thing. You know you can count on me Jeanne. You know that, right? Yes. There should be no more awkwardness between us. Little Charvet can screw himself. Please take away your hand. You think because of 3 letters and a photo, you can treat me like a slut? And you do it badly. Your hand is no good. Oh, you frightened me. I thought you weren't home. Thank you. I'm early, eh? What's happening? You don't come anymore. No dinners, no anything. Want some coffee? You look tired. No. Something worrying you? No, why? And this? Where did you get that? We got it home. Your mother hasn't seen. "Things happen in private lessons" You want to know if it's me? I'd like to understand. So would I. Let me. The whole school got one. It doesn't seem to bother you. What should I do? Call the police? And why would I do anything? You think she looks like me? I didn't say that. She's built better than I am. Want sugar? Thanks, but I don't drink coffee anymore. Only in the light of these elements... Can we understand the impact of the Reichstag fire. You don't seem interested. I prefer biology, history lacks sex. I don't think so. If there was more, would you know what to do? Get out. Good morning. Another one. I know. Them too. Good luck. Miss Kern? Please. Fresh from this morning. We no longer need a magnifying glass. And it looks less like any other. Take a look. I saw it. Good. We'll save some time? I've listened enough? Let's cut to the chase. - But it's you... - No, Jeanne. No, no... Comes a time, pity no longer pays off. You'll take a leave of absence. 15 days. Time for them to forget. What does that mean? Sick leave? Ah, no. Simpler than that. I suspend you a few weeks. So, I'm suspended?! For nothing? No proof, because I look like that? That, as you say, will start to cost us. Gobert's parents, guess why they're coming? To pull her out. That's 4 already. A haemorrhage. If there's a 5th, I'd rather it be you. Will you? I don't want anything. Just to teach my lessons. Besides, my students are waiting. You no longer have students. Keep picking these up, I'll be back. What's happening? I've been fired. I don't believe you. Then don't. What an asshole! Then go tell him. Not now! Not here! Leave me alone! So is it her or not? That's not the question. Then what is the question? The question is: Who's sending her those photos? Yes, of course, but... The hallway. What about the hallway? You didn't turn off the light. Careful now! You won't forget the cakes for Sunday? Cakes? What cakes? Our Sunday night. Oh! Your obsession with locking all doors! Leave it alone. Miss! I'm telling you, he's not there! But I'm telling you, he's not there! I know you're there Ketti! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Wretched man. But Miss... And it's not the least of the Marshall Plan's ambiguities... In fact, 1947 would be a turning point... Please excuse me. 1947 would be a turning point. General Marshall is named Secretary of State and his influence... Did Miss Zanon change rooms? She left this morning. She went with her Aunt, to recuperate in Villars. I see. Thank you. You're pulling my leg, he can't have fired her. No, he's crazy about her. Little slut who could pass for one of the students. I don't care, he comes home on weekends. Some come home all week, and then Friday night... Goodbye. With us, it's the opposite. Sure, but she's not teaching, he... A lovers' quarrel. What did I tell you? Is that him? Or is it not him? Decidedly. You gave him a drink? You took one too. An early one. Oh damn, roses! I hate roses. Mr. Adam, brought them. That was kind of you. Have another drink. Well, I like roses. Did Jeanne send you? No matter. I have no desire to jump back into that cesspit. What can I do? Have to cover myself like anyone else. I take no pleasure in splitting with Jeanne. At school Jeanne is... My oxygen. Her freshness... Her youth... Can't be replaced. More reason to take her back. Fine words. Do your colleagues agree? - Since I'm asking you. - You... But where are the others? - The others don't care! - There you go. It's a touching gesture. Do you know Jeanne well? A little, yes. In love? No. - Why? - It's better that way. You saw the photo? Thank you, I saw it. It's not her. OK, then. What would you do in my place? I don't know. Then let me deal with this my way. I'm here to ask you to come back. Did something change? Yes. Me. I reflected. I think we made too big a deal out of all this. Really? They'll stop, eventually. Sooner or later. They got what they wanted, no? To frighten you, to worry me, to hurt us. You know all that? So on Monday, there won't be any more photos? Monday. Tuesday. Any day. There won't be any more photos. I want you to come back. There it is. That's all. See you on Monday, Jeanne. What's going on? What are you doing tonight? It's Sunday. So? It's not easy. Tell her it's important. I know who it is. Who what is? The photos. It's Ketti. Ketti? I don't believe you. That's why I'm asking you what you're doing tonight. Wait, I don't understand. To go where? To the school. What is it? 30 papers to correct, problem is, I didn't take them. No big deal. Let's go. - Take all the time you need. - Alright. Well, go in. If it's him, I'll beat him up. What are we looking for exactly? This I've never seen before. It's locked. Open it. No key. Here. Still want to beat him up? I don't get it. Where did it happen? When? Who are they? Students? It happened. Does it shock you? A little, yes. It shouldn't. You know, in photos, it makes no sense. You can't understand. Ketti knows this well. That's why he's persisting. Must be his way of loving. I'll wait for him. Here? Yes. It's his room. He'll be here eventually. Then what? That's between him and me now. That's interesting. And what the hell am I doing here? - Good night sir, thank you. - It's nothing, good night. I had a moment of anger. It's over now. You're hurting me. There's a letter on your desk. I'd like you to read and sign it. Dear Miss Kern, Following our talks, we confirm permission to interrupt your courses at our establishment. We regret your leaving, having nothing but praise for your services and teaching. Do not hesitate to contact us under any circumstance, we'll always be available to vouch for your conduct, efficiency, and the privileged relationship you maintain with your students. Please rest assured of our distinguished consideration, Is that all? No. You sign it. You want to do it standing up? Do you prefer on the floor? You decide. I'm ready. Don't want to anymore? Not like that. Really? How? Touch. Touch! I don't feel you. I don't feel anything. It's not mutual, is that it? Stop it! I'm sorry. I went about it wrong. Wait. Is this what you want? Like in the photo? You're crazy! The others turned you on? Me with the others? That's enough. What is enough?! We haven't even started. You're already sweating. How long has it been since you last made love, Mr. Ketti? - Years? - Stop it! What are you talking about?! You don't know anything! For days and days I made love to you. Each time I printed a photo... Each time I sent an envelope... I made love to you! Then I started to love you. It was no longer possible. I cut out the photo. I wanted the others to see it. To give you away! To sully you. I'm allowed to! But not you! What will I do now? To get you back in the picture. Get dressed! Get dressed! All these love stories and at some point, you tell yourself... Nothing will be like it was before. Even when there was nothing before. Goodbye Bruno. Awful news. Mr. Ketti has died. He committed suicide. Why are the cops here? Jeanne. Jeanne! Ketti committed suicide. I know. What happened last night? Nothing. Why nothing? Nothing, I didn't see him. What do you mean, you didn't see him? He didn't show up. So, I had enough. So I came back home. Nobody was waiting for me. I don't have your luck. What are you doing? Are you leaving? Maybe. Mrs. Ketti is already there, she took charge of everything. That'll be fun for all of you. And you? Without me. I'll start over some place else. Something new. You have two minutes? So you knew it was Jeanne in the photo? Yes. And Ketti? How did he get this photo? By mail. There's something else. I also sent the letters. At first, it was like a game. Then Jeanne didn't want to play anymore. So, I wrote some more. And finally, I sent the photo. I couldn't know what Ketti would do with them. This is where it happened. Just before final exams. Jeanne came to help us study. Jacque and Armelle started it. Jeanne was fascinated. Jeanne's confusion probably encouraged the others. So she wouldn't say anything. Obviously, I didn't have Jeanne all to myself like I had dreamed. But it wasn't bad. It was good. It became obvious. I was under the impression that Jeanne was happy. That's why we took a photograph. And then she never wanted to be happy that way. So, I sent the letters. You see how serious this was? Yes. I even wanted to die because of it. Martin, pass me another piece. When he makes love to you, he thinks about her. What? When he makes love to you, he thinks about her. Is she crazy or what? No, she doesn't know what she's doing anymore. I see. Is it true what she says? It's a cry for help. Be careful. What do you think about Old Lady Ketti? She's doing like him, sleeping here. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. Are you Jeanne Kern? Yes. I'm Laurent's wife. I don't feel like coming in. What do you want with Laurent? In any case, it'll be clearer when you've slept together. Not for you. For him and for me. Why? I don't know. I look at you. I don't really believe it. Go fuck yourself. It's always hot in summer. So, no woollen clothing. Except, if we don't bring any, it won't be hot. Therefore, we need to bring two. In any case, my letter arrived surprisingly fast. It was a stupid letter. I can't fix it. How do others manage? Do they love each other? Do they touch their skin? It's not such a big deal for them. Why doesn't that work for me? Because I don't try? Because I don't really try. Never with the right ones. Do I intimidate them? I'm the one who's frightened. Enough to die. Why don't you say anything? Can I turn the lights on? No, turn it off. That was surely your wife. It's no big deal, you know. It's nothing new, in any case. Not for me. I'll bet you're already dressed. I win. You're leaving? You won't help me make the bed? If you want. No. Don't bother. In any case, I need to change the sheets. I need to bathe as well. I feel dirty! Don't take this the wrong way: Your hands, your smell... I hated them. I hate your desires! Your sighs... Your sweat... Your desires... Your damned pleasure! Look. It's sunny. Go away. Look, it's sunny. You should have slept a little. Laurent. You know the weight of the world isn't on your shoulders. Even less her weight. You just have ours. So we'll make ourselves light. No more than that. be available to vouch for your conduct, efficiency, and the privileged relationship you maintain with your students. Bruno Ketti. What a drama. He'd been very depressed for quite some time. Surely. Are you able to start for September make up exams? Whenever you want. Very pleased to hear it.
