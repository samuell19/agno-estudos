(tense atmospheric music) - [Man] Out here, let me tell you. I’ve got the official news bulletin that they’ve set down to find here, listen to this, okay, here we go. (clearing throat) The investigation of city and police leaders stem from the allegations... - [Thomas Voiceover] The past never dies. It hibernates in the deep caves of our minds waiting to resurface. The sound of an old song or a familiar voice. The sight of a face or a special setting. Sometimes we seek out the past in an attempt to relive the moment. Sometimes not. Sometimes the past comes sliding under the front door, a wake up call. (low thudding) I once killed a man. Or at least that’s how the story goes. - In 1985, 49 year old, Thomas Anderson, was arrested and charged in the killing of small business owner, 51-year-old, Arthur Lovell. When confronted with the possibility of receiving life imprisonment, Anderson entered into an Alford plea, which maintained his claim of innocence. The plea resulted in a 20-year prison sentence. However, he was able to withdraw the plea (typewriter clacking) after discovering the state had withheld vital evidence found while investigating the killing. Years would pass with Anderson behind bars as litigation continued. He was finally released with little to no progress made in clearing his name. Tonight, Mr. Thomas Anderson joins us to discuss his upcoming memoir. (tense atmospheric music) - After an hour-long interview, I needed a drink. So I went to my second home across town. There. Now is it possible to get the coin into the glass without touching anything at all? Can’t hit the bar, can’t try to shake the ground. - I don’t know. - Oh come on. - I give up. Those fucking cops. I know I ain’t gotta tell you. This Sullivan guy’s got some balls though. - They say a truth told with bad intent can beat all the lies you could ever invent. - [Fred] By they you mean William Blake? - By they I mean William Blake. - Oh I got one from the other day. "Whatever satisfies the soul is truth." - Walt Whitman. - Walt Whitman’s a bad motherfucker. - That’s one way of putting it. You love Walt Whitman, you love reading newspapers, you’re a dying breed. How about one more? You can’t spring for a fresh glass? - I can’t keep up with all the dirty ones you produce. - You got any matches? - May I? (blowing) (coin clinking) You a poet? - Poet, no, no. I’m nothing. - [Fred] He’s retired. And a smart ass. - Retired what? - Beer drinker. - I heard there’s good buck in that these days. - If there is I’ve yet to find it. - Put that one on me. Fred, right? - Yeah. - Keep this up you’ll be best man at my wedding. - What are you really retired from? - [Thomas] US steel. - You don’t seem like a steel worker. - I was in safety management. - Do you know Terry Cales? He’s a friend of mine. Worked in the offices. - I was a private investigator. - I read an article about you in the paper. Didn’t I? - I dunno, did you? - [Don] You’re writing that book. - Something like that. - [Don] Thomas, Thomas. - Anderson. - Anderson, Thomas Anderson. I’m Don. - Don? Thanks for the drink. - So is the book finished? - Not quite. But it’s coming one way or another. - [Don] I read that article, I thought it was just amazing. - Just what is it that you do, Don? - I’m in sales. - A salesman? - Yeah. - What do you sale? - Lot of different things over the years. Right now it’s industrial vacuums for heating and cooling systems. - That sounds exciting. - Not really. - I was joking, Don. - Can I get you another one? - No, no. I’m gonna owe you one. - Oh, I’m fine. I really should be getting going, I... - Wet Don’s whistle for me, eh? - Thanks. - You’re welcome. See what we got. - You have any kids? - What’s that? - You have any children? - No children, no. You? - Son. We don’t talk much though. - Must be tough. - Sometimes. You married? - Never got around to it. How about you? - I was, she passed away a few years ago. - I’m sorry. What is it they say? Better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all. What was her name? - Diane. - [Thomas] Here’s to Diane. - Six letter word for Aristotle’s principle of four. - [Thomas] Principle of four? - Yeah, six letters. - I can’t remember, did you say you live close by? - You know what makes a good drinking buddy, Don? - What? - A man who can enjoy the silence of the drink. And the burn. Thursday, poker. I’m bringing someone so we shouldn’t need a fifth. - Okay. - Oh, keep it. - [Thomas] Goodnight Don. - Goodnight. - [Thomas] I don’t think I’m cynical. - You make me not wanna get out of bed. You’re like a hangover on a winter morning. - I seem to have that effect on people. - You did well, you had no reason to be nervous. - [Thomas] Sweetheart, I wasn’t nervous. Those goddamn lights made me sweat like a pig. - I don’t even notice anymore. - When do you think it will air? - [Mira] Monday night. Better get that book finished. - Yeah. - It’s almost bedtime for me. I’m interviewing Daniel Sullivan in the morning. We’re gonna combine your interviews into one big piece. - [Thomas] Gonna fix everything in one night, huh? - What we’re doing here is making a difference. I’ll be in touch, goodnight. - Goodnight. I first met Mira six months ago. She wanted to interview me for a new piece she was doing for the local news channel. At first I said no, but she was persistent. She was ambitious and naive to a fault about the world. But she also inspired me. (sirens wailing in distance) - What do you say, Donny boy? Following me, Don? - I was, but I wanted to speak with you. - [Thomas] That’s what we’re doing right now. - In private. - In private? - [Don] Yeah. - Yeah, all right. Want a drink? - No thank you. - Bullshit. You’re gonna talk to me in private, you’re gonna do it with a drink in your hand. Go get yourself a glass. - I need help. - There are clean glasses in the cupboard. - No, I mean from a professional. - [Thomas] Yeah, what kind of help? - I’d like to hire you. - Hire me to what? - You know, as a private investigator. - I’m 75 years old. - Do private eyes really ever retire? - You mean you don’t see 401K written all over this place? - I just need some answers. - Why don’t you tell me what your problem is? - I’m not really sure there is one. - I don’t follow. - Look, I’d pay you for your time. Money is really not an issue. - You think I need your money? - No, you obviously have your 401K to fall back on. - Just tell me what you want. - I don’t want to alarm you. That’s not my intention. (tense atmospheric music) - What the hell is this? - I was hoping you’d have some answers for me. - Who are you? - My name is Donald Altman. - Why don’t I feel like that answers my question? - That was left in my mailbox last month. No note, no envelope, only the picture. - I’m listening. - That’s it, I’m just as confused as you are. It’s only pure luck that I found you. - How did you find me? - The newspaper article. Interview was conducted at the bar, I figured eventually I’d run into you. - And so you have. - Aren’t you curious? - I’m bursting at the seams. But I’ve done too much digging in my lifetime. My back and legs can’t take it anymore. - So you didn’t leave the photograph? - [Thomas] What exactly is it that you want me to do? - You just did it. I’m sorry to have taken up your time. - Wait a minute! You have no idea who left this? - I don’t. (door opening and closing) - [Editor] How’s your coffee, more sugar? - Oh, no thanks. I’m not much of a coffee drinker to tell you the truth. - Oh well how about something else. Water? - No. Thanks. - Well I have to tell you, Thomas, we really love the sample chapters that you submitted. - I’m glad. - I would however recommend switching over to a computer though. I mean with typewriters I can tell you horror stories of writers who’ve lost original works. - Yeah. It may be time to update. (chuckling) - [Editor] But it’s still very poignant, very intense stuff and we’re hoping for more of the same. - I think you’ll like what’s still to come. (tense atmospheric music) - It airs Monday. Yeah. We’re gonna have dinner together and watch it. There’s Thomas now. So we’ll see you Monday then, around six, okay? Okay, bye. Hello. - Was that your brother? - Yeah, he and Wendy are coming over for dinner on Monday. - Told ya I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. - [Margaret] It’s no big deal, just a couple of friends having dinner. Well? What’d they say? - I think we have a deal. - [Margaret] Congratulations! - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - [Margaret] Are you excited? - Yeah. Well yes, yes, I’m excited! - [Margaret] So what do you wanna do? - I dunno, I dunno. - Here’s more of that stripy... - Ooh, ooh. - And you can’t even, let me see the picture. - Wait a minute now, I’m busy over here. - Watch, watch, watch. - Ooh look at us. - Okay, all right, okay. - One more. - Making it work. Shoving it in there. - Whoops, wrong. - Nope. - Oh well. - Wait a minute. - One can’t be right all the time. - You got the left angle thing there. (sighing) - That’s why one has wine. - What’s this? More wine? - Please. - [Margaret] I wonder what’s on next. - I wanna show you something. - What? Oh my god. So you actually were young once. (laughing) - [Thomas] Yeah, once upon a time. - You look like a lot of fun. - Fun? - Mm-hmm. - You see fun in a portrait? - You see that’s what I’m talking about. - What? - You never let your guard down. It’s always like you’re on duty for some imaginary job somewhere. Don’t you ever just cut loose? - Yeah, sometimes. - You know you really should, you should hang out with Bernard. - Bernard? - Yeah. He’s really a lot of fun. He’d lighten you up. You know you’ve been through a lot. You are allowed to enjoy life once in a while. (light piano music) - What? - I need a partner. ? Would be a gift to you that I once gave? ? That it’s okay? ? Not sure? - Can I ask you something? - [Thomas] Sure. - Can you see this as being part of your life? - What do you mean? - Well I mean we’ve been together now for a couple of months and you’re never really here. I mean your body’s here, but your mind’s always elsewhere. - I’ve been preoccupied with the book and other stuff. - I know you’re a good man, Thomas. I just hope you let me see it. - I will. Listen. Can we maybe talk about this later? - Sure. - I really have to get going. - I wanna give you something. Made it myself. - Peanut butter? - It’s good. - Thank you. - You call me when you get home, okay? You know I worry. - You worry too much. - It’s what I do best. See you Monday then, right? - Yeah. - Goodnight. - [Thomas] Goodnight. (tense atmospheric music) (sirens wailing in distance) (typewriter clacking) - [Man] Sean from Chaswick. All right, you’ve got my ear, buddy, what’ve you got? - [Sean] I don’t think you guys recognize all the good this police force does. Whether or not there are bad apples on the police force, give these guys the credit they deserve for the work that they do. - [Man] Oh he’s going there, all right. Let’s put you back on hold. Hold one second. All right fellas, what do you think of that one? - [Caller] You gonna take the good with the bad, of course, but these days you have to admit the bad is outweighing the good by a large margin. I think this guy’s got the studio surrounded. - [Sean] I think you’re an idiot, sir. - [DJ] There’s no need to disrespect the callers like that. That’s just a man’s opinion. However it may be wrong. I would say it was definitely wrong. You know what, this guy’s mentally challenged, the guy’s stupid. Let’s get him off the line. Let’s get another caller here. - I just ordered a drink. There was a game on, football game I think. Bartender brings over my Seagram’s and soda, whatever I was drinking, I’m not sure. He sets my change down on the bar right in front of me. Now I’d given him a 100 dollar bill and... - [Peg] What color was the bartender’s shirt? (laughing) - You shut up? I’m trying to tell a story. - [Peg] Here, I’ll give you $100 to shut up. - Where did you get $100? Put that away! Now I gather up my change and I happen to notice that somebody had drawn glasses on a $20 bill over Andrew Jackson’s face. Give the bartender a nice tip, he’d been treating me good that night. I’m starting to get shitfaced here. Time goes by, I don’t even know how many drinks I’ve had at this point, plus I’m pissed ’cause my team was losing on the television. I mean I’d been screaming profanities at that screen for three whole hours with this old guy sitting next to me. At some point, I looked down and my money is gone. How can that be? Did I spend all that? Not a chance, no way. I look over at the bar in front of the old man, what do I see? Four-eyed Andrew Jackson. Hmm? Should I confront him about this? Yeah, I mean I got to right, so I do. - [Margaret] What’d you do? - All right so I go now, remember I’m drunk. I go, "Hey old man, did you take my money off the bar?" And he goes, and he’s probably the only guy in the bar more drunk than I am. He goes, "Go fuck your mother, I got me own money." I didn’t know whether to feel threatened or what, but I get up off the stool, right. I get right in his face and I say, "Old man, I know that money belongs to me "because I recognize those glasses on that face." He doesn’t say a thing. He reaches down, he picks up the bill, he shoves it in his mouth, and he starts to chew on it. - [Margaret] Ew. - Yeah! I mean making this disgusting noise like some kind of an animal eating something that’s alive. This noise like, (mimics chomping) And then he swallows it. And he starts to laugh this evil laugh like I’d never heard before. I mean I didn’t know what to do, so I hit him in the back of the head. Yeah, he flies off the stool, he hits the ground, I come around, I jump on him and I’m wailing on him. The old man is bleeding, but he never stops that awful, evil laugh. A few guys come around, they break up the fight, the bartender threatens to call the police and he throws me out, but not before I get my money off the bar. And I put it in my pocket, head outside. Now, there’s about a foot of snow on the ground. Get in the car, listening to the rest of the game, and I’m wondering how much money I have left. So I go into my pocket and I bring out this wad of cash. Like 160 bucks. I only brought the hundred dollar bill to the bar. - Oh my god! - I didn’t even check my own pockets. - You are a despicable human being, you really are. (laughing) - What was I supposed to do, give it back after all that? Hey, I gotta take a pee. - Want more wine? - [Peg] Yes, thank you. - [Margaret] Hey, did I tell you Karen came by the other day? - No, how’s the baby? - [Margaret] Oh he’s doing well. He wasn’t with her though, he’s much better. - [Peg] The baby was sick for a while, right? - Yeah, they had to take him to the hospital middle of the night with an ear infection. - [Peg] Oh. - But he’s much better now. - That’s good. - What time is it? It’s almost eight. It’s gonna be on soon. - [Peg] Oh! - Hey let’s go, let’s just leave everything. - Officer Sullivan, you filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the department early last month. |||||||||||| In the formal complain, you described a number of events |||||||||||| in detail where misconducts have taken place. |||||||||||| These documents have not been made public yet, so I’ll ask you. Could you describe to us briefly what those documents entail? ||||||||||||| - Um, you name it. ||||||||||||| I’ve been in the presence of bribes, kickbacks to dozens |||||||||||| of city officers from a number of well-known establishments |||||||||||| in the city I won’t name now, ||||||||||||| other officers and city detectives willingly perjuring |||||||||||| themselves just to ensure a conviction. (pensive atmospheric music) I mean it’s nothing shocking. I mean it’s as old as the profession itself. I suppose the tipping point was seeing and hearing some of those newer, younger guys. Such blatant abuses of power. - [Thomas] Doesn’t seem as though too much has changed, does it? - Is that why you wrote this book, to try to change things? - No. The truth, in my opinion, is like a compass. Help navigate us through this life. In the end, truth is all we have. That should be known. - [Man On Television] Protected and safe from. You don’t have to fear being a victim of identity theft or identity fraud when you sign up for our identity theft protection plan. When you enroll in identity theft, we protect you. Our experts do regular credit checks. We can assist you with setup today. - [Fred] What the hell is this, peanut butter? - Margaret told me to give it to you, you’ll love it, it’s delicious. I had a feeling he was coming in here tonight. Have you seen this guy before? - Before last week, never. But he’s been here every night since. - What the hell? - I’m the bartender, you’re the private eye. - Watch my back. You didn’t leave either of these and you don’t know who did? - This was left on my doorstep. - What the hell is this? If you know something, you better tell me right now. - I’m receiving telephone calls in the middle of the night. - Saying what? - Nothing! Really. Person asked for someone I never heard of, I tell them they have the wrong number and they start cursing at me. I don’t know if it’s related! - [Thomas] Who else knows? - I’ve told no one. - Are you certain? - Absolutely. What about you, does anyone know about these? - [Thomas] Of course not. - What about that bartender? (tense atmospheric music) - Hey I’ve known Fred for 35 years. I trust that man about as much as you can trust any human being. - [Don] Have you seen this motel? - As a matter of fact. - [Don] You’ve been here before? - You’ve done your research on me. You don’t know the story? - I’d like to hear it from you. (sighing) - I was hired by a woman who had reason to believe she had a cheating husband. Standard investigation. Followed the husband to the car wash, to the grocery store, to the barber shop, and I discovered that he was in fact having many affairs with men. Judging by the number of partners, I assumed he was working as a prostitute of some sort. This was the motel he was working. - That’s it? - No. In addition, I discovered through hidden cameras in the home that the husband was sexually abusing the couple’s seven year old son. I finished my investigation, presented the evidence to the wife to do with as she will. I was arrested for his killing a short time thereafter. - [Don] This is the husband? - Was the husband. Arthur Lovell. - Do you think it’s some sort of threat? - Oh, this is ridiculous. A bunch of photographs. Do you know this man? - [Don] I don’t think so. - Well this was a very productive meeting of the minds. - How long were you in prison? - Long enough. - Sometimes I think about what prison life would be like. Having all your freedom taken away. - There’s not much more freedom out here. - What’d you do when you got out? - Look for work for a few years. Just wasn’t much business left for me. - Did you family help? - I told you I have no family. Fred over there let me use a spare room until I could get a place of my own. I had enough money saved from before, so I made do. - Do you ever get angry? - Sure. But not for the reasons you might think. You’d be surprised, Don, how much freedom there is in being stripped of everything. - [Mira] So what’d you think? - I thought you did great. You should be proud. - All I did was present your stories, you two did all the work. You’re like my Woodward and Bernstein. - Maybe we’ll sell some books after all. - How’s your shopping going? - Actually we got a deal. - [Mira] That’s great news. We should celebrate. How about coffee? - How about whiskey? - [Mira] How about dinner? - [Thomas] Okay. - Tomorrow night, Eamel’s on MacNealy, eight o’clock? - Eight o’clock sounds good. - [Mira] I’ll see you then. - Mira. - [Mira] Yeah? - I wanna thank you for giving me a forum to tell my story. - Well thank you for being brave enough to tell it. (tense atmospheric music) - You’re the brave one. - [Mira] I’ll see you tomorrow night. - Okay. - [Mira] Night. - Goodnight. (car approaching) (letter opening) (low thudding) - Here’s something to keep you warm. - Oh, thank you. - You’re welcome. It’s good to see you again. - Yeah, you too. - Hey. - Joe. You gonna sit down? How are you? - I’m well. - How’s my grandson? - He’s doing very well. - What is he now, five, six? - He just turned eight. - Eight? Where’s the time go, eh? - What brings you by? - Just checking in. - We saw you on TV the other night. - Oh yeah? - Sarah did actually. I took Tommy to the movies. - What’d you see? - The Magic Turtle of Munville. - Oh. Sounds like a winner. Where is Tommy? - He’s at Sarah’s mother’s house. She’s been helping out since Mom died. Sarah’s been working nights. You remember Colleen? - Yeah. I remember Colleen. (tense atmospheric music) Been taking pictures? - That’s Sarah’s. She’s taking classes. (clearing throat) Do you need anything? - Like what? - I wish you had called first. I could have had Sarah go shopping, the cupboards are bare right now. - That’s fine. - So what’s been going on with you? - Uh, not bad. Bar’s doing well. Fred says hello. - How’s the book coming? - I’m in the home stretch. - Good. I know a lot of people wanna read it. - Got your Christmas card. - Sarah sent them out. - How are things with her? - Good. - Everyone’s doing well then, huh? - What are those? - Oh. - Is that you? - Yeah. - [Joe] Jeez. What year is this from? - Oh, early ’80s I think. - You look young. - Yeah. - Who took this? - I don’t remember. - Where’d you get it from? - Someone gave it to me. - What are these? - Oh nothing, just some old pictures, you know. I don’t wanna hold you up. Should get going. - You don’t have to go. - No I shoulda called first. Shouldn’t just show up like this. - It’s okay, you can stay. - No I really have to. Got some running around to do. I’ll come back. - Okay. - I’ll call and set something up for when Tommy’s here. - Don’t forget. - I won’t. - It was good seeing you. - Yeah, you too. (church bells ringing) (choral singing) Bless me father for I have sinned. It’s been quite a while since my last confession. (tense atmospheric music) My sins. I took the lord’s name in vain on several occasions. I drink a lot. I don’t even know if that’s a sin. I just don’t know where to start. I wasn’t a good father. I wasn’t good at much. In fact the only thing I was ever good at was evading people’s secrets and pointing out other people’s flaws. I’m older now and it’s hard trying to wipe the slate clean for yourself. Most of it is just under the surface. Keep looking in the mirror trying to find something worthwhile. It’s not an easy task. - [Waitress] You ready to order? - Still waiting for someone. - [Mira] You’ve reached Mira Malloy. Please leave a message after the tone and I’ll return your call as soon as possible. Thank you and have a nice day. (beeping) - You got a lot of balls standing me up like this. Anyway, I’ve got a card game tonight. Give me a call when you get home. Just wanna make sure you’re all right. This is Thomas. Okay, bye. - [Fred] Where’d you find this guy at? - He’s Margaret’s brother. I promised her. - I’d like to knock his teeth out. - Oh come on, it’s just this once. - He gives me a headache. (chuckling) - Conversation is the most fruitful and natural exercise for our minds. - A conversation’s a dialogue. This guy’s all monologue. Let’s feed him the fuckin’ peanut butter. - Hey can I ask you guys a question? Who’s Michael? - He’s the former owner. We didn’t feel like buying a new sign, so we kept the name. Seems to work, huh? - So you’re part owner then? - Not really. I’m just territorial. - Where are you from, Fred? - He’s from where I’m from, Bernard. - So you guys grew up together then, huh? - Yep, we’re from the same stock. - Were you a private investigator too or were you always tending bar? - No, I don’t have the patience that Thomas has. (chuckling) - I see. I raise 20. - I’m in. (laughing) - Another one bites the dust. So, have you ever done time? - Have I ever done time? Fuck’s up with this guy? - Bernard. - No problem, I’m just curious. So you guys have been friends a long time. - Fred used to assist me with cases in the old days, yes, we’re very good friends. - Well that’s a good thing. I mean not many people have that. God knows I don’t. Figure I’ll warm up a little bit while I’m listening to the rest of the game. I go into my pocket, wanna see how much money I have left. I bring out this wad of cash, it’s about $160. I only brought the hundred dollar bill to the bar. (laughing) (tense atmospheric music) (typewriter clacking) (car pulling up) (screaming) - [DJ] Hey has anyone heard anything new on this whole Sullivan case? - [Man] Yeah did you see the TV interview the other day? He was making all sorts of crazy allegations. - [DJ] Oh, the television, yeah if it’s on TV it’s real, right? - [Man] Yeah he was making some pretty wild accusations. Makes you wonder if the juice is gonna be worth the squeeze on this one. - [DJ] Juice worth the squeeze, very nice, very nice. (typewriter clacking) For those who don’t know, this guy Sullivan was a cop and he’s making all these allegations that there was police involved in doing bad things. Police doing bad things, I can imagine that happening in this city. Here we have our boys in blue that should be out protecting people in the streets, but yet they’re rolling prostitutes, they’re selling drugs. Where did you get your drugs last time you bought drugs? Yeah, I get mine from Uncle Al, he sells them out of his own RV in Keysport. - [Man] Well I usually go down to the 12th precinct, they got the best prices in town. - I’ve seen you like this before. That look in your eyes. And you’re not gonna stop until you find whatever it is you’re looking for. What I’m trying to say is maybe, well sometimes, you’re better off not knowing everything there is to know. For your own sanity. At the risk of torturing an old cliche, you’re too old for this shit. - Maybe I’ll take up golf. - Don’t fuckin’ do that. This ain’t no joke. - What then? - I don’t know what. - I’ve got eyes, I’ve got ears, I’ve got breath in my lungs. That’s about all I’ve got left. No matter how shitty things get, you have to ask yourself what now? What do I do? I’ve gotta do something or else I’ll just curl up and die. If I haven’t done it yet, I doubt I ever will. - Just what is it exactly that you’re looking for? (dramatic orchestral music) - I’m hoping I know it when I see it. I don’t expect you to understand. You’re different. You have a family at home, a mortgage. - I also have a car payment. So don’t fuckin’ wreck it. (car starting) (tense atmospheric music) ? I don’t want you to come back ’round here no more? ? Maybe in the morning I’ll be gone? ? Until then leave? ? Let me have? (tense atmospheric music) - [Man] I don’t think Don’s home. - [Thomas] Yes, I just knocked. - He normally goes out to dinner on Fridays. - [Thomas] I see. - I’ll make sure he gets the letter, though. - What’s that? - The letter. - Oh yes, thank you. - [Man] Uh huh. - You don’t like Bernard, do you? - lt’s not that, I just thought maybe we could be together... - You know I really don’t see what the big deal is. - It’s not a big deal. I just wanted a nice quiet time together, you know, alone. - I’ll tell you Thomas, I’m thinking of taking all that money that I took from you guys last night and opening a bank. (chuckling) - Don’t be a sore winner. - I’m just making a joke. I will say though I don’t think Freddy boy likes me very much. - Oh come on. - I’m just saying. I got a pretty good sense about these things. - Takes him a longer time to warm up to people, that’s all. - Oh, I hope so. Anyway, I had a great time, thank you. - Don’t mention it. - My pockets thank you too. - Eat your pie. (chuckling) - Hey I got an idea. When the weather changes, how about you guys come down to the lake with us, huh? - You know that is a great idea. - What do you say? - I’ll run it past Fred. It’s an odd feeling. That feeling of being watched from a distance, but not quite knowing for certain. In those situations you have only two choices. (tense atmospheric music) Hide in the dark and maybe you’ll meet your watcher face to face. The other choice is to stand in the light and wait. (mellow rock music) (phone ringing) - Yeah, Michael’s. That’s for you. - Yeah. I didn’t leave anything. Listen to me, Don. Oh will you shut up and listen to me for one minute? I admit it, I followed you. But only because I thought you were playing me. I followed you to the bookstore and then I lost you. - What bookstore? - The bookstore, Don, don’t be thick. You were in a pornography shop, okay, I know, I was there. Sit down. Sick of this shit. Followed you to the bookstore and I lost you sometime thereafter. I came here to see if you were home, that’s when I saw the envelope. I looked at it and then put it back where I found it. Don’t you see this guy is screwing with us? This is what he wants us to be doing. Where’s the photo I saw? Well go get it! Do you know this boy? - [Don] No. - Look at the picture, Don. Do you know who this person is? - No. - Are you sure? - I’m sure. Do you know who that is? - This was the son of Arthur and Susan Lovell. Now I’m gonna ask you one last time. I want you to answer me truthfully. Have you ever seen or met William Lovell, this boy, before? - Maybe. - What does that mean, maybe? - I’ve probably seen him on the news. - Oh shut up. - How did they convict you? - He was a kid. People can coach kids into saying anything they want them to. Arthur would often bring the kid to the motel with him. Get a room, leave him to watch television while he... Sometimes he would just leave him in the backseat of the car. He could’ve caught a glimpse of me tailing his father. He was confused. Those prosecutors told him what to say. Never saw me shoot his father, that I know. - Why didn’t you go to the police with your evidence? - My allegiance is to my client. If she wanted to go to the police with the evidence, that was up to her. - [Don] What about the boy? - What about the boy? - [Don] Could’ve saved him. - He was saved, Don, someone clipped his father. - Who do you think did it? - It’s my opinion no one bothered to look at the wife. Wasn’t even that clever when you think about it. She had all the evidence, one shot would eliminate the problem. Protect her family name. My question is why did you get this picture? What does William Lovell mean to you? - I’d like you to leave now. - Come on, Don. You’re a salesman. Convince me why I should believe one word you say. Where do you fall in all this? Arthur, Susan, William, Thomas? What’s your link? - This came sometime last night. (tense atmospheric music) - Which one of my estranged relatives lives here? - I’m not interested. (sirens wailing in distance) (jazz music) - [Woman] Good evening, sir. (ominous percussive music) - [Waitress] Sir? - I didn’t order that. - [Waitress] This is the house special for the evening. - [Man] Gentlemen, please welcome... - Thank you. - [Man] Jean Davis. (applauding) (light piano music) ? I heard some children playing? ? In the house across the way? ? The girls and the boys looked up from their toys? ? When they heard a girly say? ? My pussy belongs to daddy? ? It’s his exclusively? ? My pussy belongs to daddy? ? So let my pussy be? - I’m sorry sir, this is a private party by invitation only. ? You can ride on my kiddy car too? - I got my invitation right here. ? You can play with my dolls and my Polly? - [Man] Excuse me. ? But one thing’s forbidden to you? ? My pussy belongs to daddy? ? He means the world to me? ? So please don’t offend my daddy? ? And let my pussycat be? ? And let my pussycat be? (applauding) - [Man] I didn’t get your name, Mr.... - Altman. Donald Altman. - [Man] Would you follow me this way please, Mr. Altman? (jazz music) (door closing) - Why don’t you come in, have a seat? - Who are you? - [William] Sit down. You want a drink? - What do you want? - I wanna offer you a drink. You’re the last person I ever thought I’d see coming in here. - Just tell me what it is you want from me. - You showed up at my place. - You want money? ’Cause I can promise you I don’t have any. - Who told you about this place? How did you find me? (tense atmospheric music) - From the picture you sent. I want this to stop now, whoever you are. - You don’t recognize me. Guess I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s been a long time. I was a little kid. - Gonna ask you one last time. What is it that you want? - What do you think I could possibly want from you? - Revenge. - I’ve never seen any of this. Except for this place, of course. - If this doesn’t stop now, you’re gonna be sorry. - Do you think that I hate you? - I don’t know what you think. But I can promise you you’re wrong. - A heart is too heavy on its own to hold hate. - I want you out of my life. - Tell you the same thing, but as far as I’m concerned, you’re stuck in mine. - Your father was a sick man! - I loved my father. He wasn’t perfect. He made mistakes like every man, but he was good to me. He was there for me. - You’re a confused young man. (gun clicking) Easy now. - [William] You’re not the only one getting gifts. - I hope someday you get the help that you need. - Don’t forget your photos. (door opening and closing) (tense atmospheric music) (gun thudding) - [Bernard] How you doing, Tom? - Good. - [Bernard] Yeah? Peg says you’re having trouble finishing the book. - Just doing some last-minute tweaks, that’s all. - You don’t look well. - I’m fine. - [Bernard] Peg’s worried about you. Actually that’s why she organized this party tonight. ’Cause she said you haven’t been feeling well. - [Thomas] I’m working. Trying to hammer out the last couple pages. - [Bernard] I imagine it would be difficult for anybody to dredge up the past like that. For you it must be 10 times as hard. - [Thomas] It’s not easy. - Tom, I’ve never asked you this before. If you don’t wanna answer you don’t have to. But I am curious. What’s it like on the inside? You know, prison? - It’s where all the hate and anger in the world comes to cook. - You want my advice? Put this book behind you and get on with the rest of your life! You’ll be better off for it. (tense atmospheric music) (gasping) (crying) - Oh my god. Margaret! - What the hell’s going on? - [Raymond] You don’t seem surprised by two strange men waiting in your dark apartment. - Believe it or not it’s not the first time it’s happened. There’s nothing random about a couple of dicks. So what do you want? - Tom. My name is Detective Raymond Fines. And this is my partner, Detective Clive Reed. - Did they assign those names with your badges? - Afraid not. Oh, we made a few moves while we were waiting, hope you don’t mind. - And stole my booze, too, huh? - Sorry about that. We were waiting a long time. - It’s all right. Checkmate. (pieces clattering) - You understand that a protection from abuse order prohibits you from being within 100 yards of Mr. Lovell and his establishment. - I consider that a favor. - You understand that failure to comply with this order could lead you to being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And you understand with your history what that could mean. I mean at your age. You don’t wanna spend the duration behind bars, do you? - Raymond. Do you mind if I call you Raymond? - [Raymond] I actually prefer that you do, seeing as we’re gonna be talking a lot more now. - Raymond, couldn’t a simple piece of mail have saved you a lot of trouble? I could still read, you know. - Wanted to talk to you about something as well. - [Thomas] Really? - We wanted to show you something. - This sounds important, let me get my glasses. Okay. - My condolences in advance. (tense atmospheric music) (screaming) Now I wanna play something for you. And I want you to just sit there and listen. - [Thomas] Maybe we’ll sell some books after all. - [Mira] How’s the shopping going? - [Thomas] Actually we got a deal. - [Mira] That’s great news, we should celebrate. How ’bout coffee? - [Thomas] How ’bout whiskey? - [Mira] What about dinner? - [Thomas] That’s great. - [Mira] Tomorrow night, Eamel’s on MacNealy, eight o’clock? - [Thomas] Eight o’clock sounds good. - [Mira] I’ll see you then. - [Thomas] Mira? - [Mira] Yeah? - [Thomas] I want to thank you for giving me a forum to tell my story. - [Mira] Well thank you for being brave enough to tell it. - [Thomas] You’re the brave one. - [Raymond] We understand each other? - And Officer Danny Sullivan? - Officer Sullivan is alive and under protective custody. Due to testify next month. Not much can be done about that now. - You monsters. - No, I’m a messenger boy. The real monsters are a lot more scary. - Chief of police, DA, mayor. - The men I’m representing are very powerful lunatics, Tom. They snap their fingers and the creek rises. Now somebody’s gonna go down and they know that, but not the finger snappers. It was an unfortunate circumstance, I mean, wrong place, wrong time. What do you think they’ll do to you? - My story is ancient history. - And you’re trying to rewrite it. Pensions are still being collected for Christ sakes. - I don’t care what they do to me. - Maybe someone you care about then. I’m not throwing out threats here. I’m just trying to think a few moves ahead for you. Anyway, you’re being watched. - And bugged, obviously. They wanted me to let you know that. - The photographs? - [Raymond] Oh I’ll take those with me. - No. The other photographs. (tense atmospheric music) - I don’t know of any other photographs. But I can tell you this is not a game. You want my advice? - Fuck you. - You so desperately wanna be a good guy that you fail to recognize one thing. - What’s that? - They don’t exist. - Mira was good. - [Raymond] Like I said, they don’t exist. - Tell your buddies the past is coming to bite them in the ass. - Forget the past. Go live a life with that girlfriend of yours. Margaret, right? (door slamming) - Mr. Anderson. - Hello. - Thank you for coming at such short notice. - Oh sure. - Take a seat. - I got your message. I’m assuming you wanted to go over some of the final details of the agreement. - Not exactly. - Oh. What is it you wanted to discuss then? - This is a little awkward, but we received an anonymous package. It was a DVD. Some security footage of some place. - I should’ve said something before. The past couple weeks I’ve been harassed. Anonymous envelopes left on my doorstep, usually filled with a random photograph. - What kind of photograph? - lt’s too difficult to explain. Been followed without my knowledge, bugged. It’s been a nightmare. - Have you gone to the police? - I went to the man I thought responsible to try to reason with him. It... Oh anyway. I felt threatened. I was only trying to protect myself. I was hoping it’d come to an end, but I apologize. - [Man] This doesn’t leave us in a good position. - I know. I think that was his goal. - [Man] I understand the man in the video is William Lovell. - Yes. - [Man] I’m sorry Mr. Anderson... - Thomas, please. - Thomas. This doesn’t leave us with much of a choice, but to pass on your book. This video suggests, and I’m not even sure, but if it gets out and I already have a feeling that it’s already begun, it’s gonna destroy whatever credibility that you have before the book’s even released. - Credibility. Now there’s a concept for you. - Sorry to hear about Mira. - What, you heard? - Yeah, it’s all over the news. - What are they saying? - Something about a robbery gone wrong. - Oh! Christ! - [Fred] Can’t make this your problem. - My problem? You know what my problem is? Everyone just wants to be left alone to their own little realities! Nobody really cares what’s going on anymore. They just wanna disguise the truth, control it, so that if anybody looks they’ll feel safe. But if that doesn’t work then they’ll just scare you away from the truth! I am sick of the bullshit! I’m sick of the lies and the scams and the fakes and the phonies and the cover ups. And religion and politics and business. The media. I can’t even watch television anymore without wanting to fucking puke! I am sick of my intelligence being insulted by assholes just trying to influence how I think, what’s right, what’s wrong, who’s good, who’s bad. We have all been burned! We all have our cracks. What the hell is so wrong with that? I’m sick of whiskey, gimme a beer. - So what now? (tense atmospheric music) - [Man] On one thing, managing investments. Any way you work with us you benefit from our active approach to investment management. Which means you can be assured that we are always striving to maximize your return. Whether you have large or separate accounts... (typewriter clacking) - [Man] Welcome back to City Talk, I’m here today with Thomas Anderson. Thomas Anderson is here to discuss a new memoir entitled A Fancy Piece Of Homicide which details the highly publicized 1985 murder case that sense Anderson to prison for 13 years. Mr. Anderson, thank you for joining us. - [Thomas] Thank you. I wanna thank you for giving me a forum to tell my story. - [Mira] Thank you for being brave enough to tell it. (typewriter clacking) - [Man] Mr. Anderson, do you feel that you were set up or targeted in any way? - Well. I discuss that in detail in my book. (typewriter clacking) - [Man] Do you think that it’s possible the real killer could ever be brought to justice? - No, I don’t think so. But hopefully the truth can. - [Man] Mr. Anderson, it was a pleasure speaking with you. Thank you very much for joining us today. - [Thomas] Yes, thank you. (typewriter clacking) (sighing) (mellow rock music) What do you want? - I wanna talk to you. - I don’t think now is a very good time, Bernard. - I got friends downtown. 15 years in the mayor’s office. I want you to know that I know the truth about you. (tense atmospheric music) - [Fred] You better get outta here. - When you gave Lovell’s wife the evidence against him, she wanted him to pay, but she wanted to protect her son, protect her image in society. And if word of all that had gotten out, her family would have been destroyed. So she made you an offer, cash, for every piece of evidence against him, as well as his murder. I mean that would make Arthur a martyr in his family instead of an unfaithful sexual predator. Susan would just be the innocent victim, widow. She’d help her son suppress any memories of what his father had done to him. When you got caught that just made the plan all the more perfect. Every detail tied up in a nice, neat little bow. - You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about! - No? You’re the one who likes the quotes, how ’bout this one? You tell a big enough lie and you tell it often enough, it’ll be believed. - You better get out now while you still can. - I’m not afraid of you. - You should be. - Stay away from my sister. - We been friends now, what, nearly 40 years? And believe me it doesn’t make a bit of difference one way or the other. But did you kill Lovell? - You’re the first person to ask me that question that wasn’t a lawyer or a cop. (phone ringing) - Michael’s. - [Thomas] Hello? - [Don] Thomas? - [Thomas] What is it, Don? - [Don] Thomas, I’m sorry. (tense atmospheric music) I know you’re not responsible for the photos. - No shit. (crying) Have you been drinking? I’m coming over. You hear me? Don? Don? (crying) - I always knew you were around. That you lived in the city. I tried to forget. I hoped that everything would just go away. He was blackmailing me. Arthur Lovell had pictures. He was gonna show them to my wife. (tense atmospheric music) I had to do something. (gun firing) (dog barking) - [Man] Call an ambulance! - I’ve watched everything get taken away from you and did nothing, like a coward. That first night at your place, I went there to kill you. - Why didn’t you kill me? - I don’t know. I froze. - Bullshit. Why didn’t you kill me? - Because I already had! I can’t go on hurting others anymore. - You’d have done me a favor if you had. Don. Don. - You’d have to shoot me if I came at you. - Look Don, no gun. You’ve hurt me enough already, put the razor down. Didn’t you read the newspapers? I killed Arthur Lovell. I killed him and went to jail for it, all right? I served my time and now we have to get on with what we have left. Put the goddamn razor down! (shouting) (tense atmospheric music) - No, I need to die! - You’re not thinking clearly, understand me? - I need to be punished! - Stop struggling. Stop. - Just go! (shouting) Please just go. Please. - [Operator] 911, what is the nature of your call? - [Thomas] Hello, I need an ambulance at 1349 Riverdale Road. A man’s been injured. Bleeding bad. - [Operator] Is the person breathing? Sir, stay on the line with me. Sir, are you there? (sirens wailing) (water running) - [Man] I read this today in the paper. Local talk show host Mira Malloy has been found murdered in her home. According to this they suspect that it was a home invasion or hot burglary. Possibly not murder. But I don’t know what else you would call it. (phone ringing) (tense atmospheric music) - Hello? Hello? Who is this? - [Thomas On Phone] Don’t you read the newspapers? I killed Arthur Lovell. I killed him and went to jail for it, all right? I served my time and now we have to get on with what we got left. (tense atmospheric music) (typewriter dinging) - [Margaret] I know you’re a good man, Thomas. I just hope you let me see it. - [Thomas Voiceover] I will. (dramatic atmospheric music) There are some things you can’t get out on paper. Some things are stuck to man’s soul. Eating away until there’s nothing left. A man would do anything to get it all out. Anything for the truth to be known. A man would cut it out of him with a razor if he could. I know. I’ve seen it in the past. (tense atmospheric music)
