Yusaku I'd been in jail before First time for fighting I was only 22 then, and living a rough life Jail didn't mean much It made me feel real important among the bums I didn't know right from wrong, or even cared which end was up or down I was stuck in that small town till I was 30 Then, I got disgusted My life would be ruined Then I thought, nothing from this world could stop me Then, the mine was shut down So, I came to Hokkaido I wanted a new start in life But when I got to Yubari... The winters were freezing. There were no friends The work was hard... there was nothing to live for If I hadn't met that woman, I'd have given up in 5 years $1,200 please Take the money here May I help you? $980...

Finish I never thought of her feelings I don't want this This bamboo is useful Be careful I forced her into marriage When we have a baby, I'll tie a big carp streamer on that pole Were you really happy with her? The next year she got pregnant I have to see the doctor today Do you have a fever? No Then, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong Why see the doctor if you don't feel bad? You mean... a baby?

Why couldn't she wait for you? Don't ask that That's real personal She should have had more patience, Yusaku really loved her I'd have waited for years Real easy for you to say But reality is different I'm positive I'd have waited I can't see I really mean it I think she's cold You are so rude You're wrong I forced her to divorce me I also forced her to get married I thought it was the only way I won't change my mind... You're still young... If you want... You can find a good man When you do, marry him and raise a family You will be happy Understand? You'll do it? Next to my name, print your name, and sign it Take it to City Hall... And have it recorded Then, we'll mean nothing to each other You really are selfish, aren't you?

She never returned Later, I got a letter It was the divorce We need your verification... And here is a letter Just a piece of paper... Man and wife are now strangers One piece of paper smashes it all Poor woman I understand Yusaku's feelings Don't you know what you did to her? You know... What else could I do for her? That was all What do I have? I was a murderer Why did this happen? Was I born just to live like this? I can't change till I die? It's fate Tomorrow, we'll go to Sapporo Then, I'll say goodbye What'll you do then? Look for work If there's no work in Sapporo, I'll go to Tokyo Good night Finding work, won't be easy for him What's wrong, not saying anything? Don't you feel anything? Are you crying? I'm sorry.
