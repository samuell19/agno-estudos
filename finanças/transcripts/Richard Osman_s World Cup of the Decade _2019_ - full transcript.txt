This programme contains strong language and adult humour. Hello, everybody and welcome along to the World Cup Of The Decade, how lovely to have you here. Over the next 90 minutes we are gonna be revealing the winners of a series of huge Twitter polls to find the best things of the decade. This evening, we are gonna find out the winners of the best TV show, the best song, the best new thing and the best film of the 2010s. But a lot has changed in the decade. At the start of the decade Orange ls The New Black was a television programme, and now orange is the new black is the way of remembering the sequence of US presidents. That's how we remember them. Things change. Things change. At the start of the decade we all ate meat, at the end of the decade, we're all vegans. There was that brief bit in the middle of the decade when we were all eating meat, but all the meat was made out of horse. Do you remember that? But the biggest change of the decade, in 2010 Prince Andrew could not sweat. And now look at the guy, he is... It is rolling off him in buckets, this guy. Er, we're gonna find out all sorts of fun things about the decade. I want you to welcome, please, though, my guests, who are gonna be chatting through all these polls, they're gonna be telling us their favourites, they're gonna be furious about some of the winners, as are you. Enjoy yourself, though. Please welcome Mr Jon Richardson. APPLAUSE Lorraine Kelly. Rhianna Dhillon. And Mr Alex Brooker. Hey, everybody. Hello, there. Jon? Hello. Have you had a good decade? Lots of changes in your life. Yes, well, I'm wearing... This shirt is my decade, because I bought this at the start of the decade. Yeah, I can... You can tell. JON CHUCKLES I wore it for my first DVD buttoned up, and now look. I mean... That's a good decade, innit, that? And the fact that you said DVD, which was something we used to have, wasn't it, in 2010s, as well? Yeah, I just missed the VHS boom. Sadly. Lorraine, how lovely to have you here. Thank you. I didn't like calling you Lorraine Kelly because I think you should be Dame Lorraine Kelly. Oh, no, no. Is that something we can look forward to in the next decade? No absolutely not, no. Who thinks Lorraine Kelly should be a dame? No, don't. AUDIENCE CHEERS Dame. They've offered it to you, though, right? No, they have not. It'll never happen. Never in a million years. If they've offered it to you, wink. No, honestly, they really haven't. She just winked, she winked. Rhianna, how lovely to have you here. You're here to help me out with all sorts of facts and figures because you... Know everything about movies, about TV, you're a film critic, all that kind of malarkey, you also are our youngest person. I wonder if you can tell us, Rhianna, how old were you at the start of the decade? RICHARD SIGHS Just a wee baby. 20 years old. Yeah. That's depressing, isn't it? I tell you what, though, it's a good trick if you wanna find out how old someone is, ask them how old they were ten years ago, because they like the answer, and the maths is really easy. Nice to have you here. Alex Brooker? Hello. Nice to have you here. Now, what a decade for you, what were you doing in 2010? Oh, man. No, it is not, and thank the good Lord for that. Now, we're gonna start this evening with telly, cos we're gonna find the best TV show of the decade. Now, what we did, we put out a whole series of polls on Twitter, everybody voted, over 2.5 million votes we got, we got the 16 highest qualifiers and we split them into four groups, and we're gonna find out who wins each of those groups. OK? Four groups, each winner goes through to the semifinals. Now, TV shows, 16 of 'em, shall we take a look at our first group? What would you like to win out of this group, please? Our first group is... Line Of Duty, Black Mirror, Great British Bake Off, and Ru Paul's Drag Race. Anyone got any particular favourites? Oh, this is too hard. You've got Line Of Duty and Ru Paul. We have. How can I choose? That's like choosing your favourite child. Cannot. Well, no, you do. Line Of Duty, any Line Of Duty fans here? Love Line Of Duty. Love it. When I was watching, one of them started saying Haitch instead of Aitch, like, which is the thing that comes in, but I just think it'd be one of the great grammatical jokes of all time if Aitch and Haitch are two different people. One of my absolutely favourite things about Line Of Duty - I think one of everyone's favourite things - was Ted Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, and certainly as the series went on, as well, he just became a succession of catchphrases, but all of which were brilliant. Shall we take a little look at some of them now? We are only interested in one thing and one thing only, and that is bent coppers. Bent coppers. Bent coppers. Bent coppers. Bent copper. Bent coppers... I didn't float up the Lagan on a bubble. Mother of God. Mother of God. Mother of God. Mother of God. Mother of God. We weren't born yesterday, fella. Fella. Fella. Fella. Fella. Fella. Fella. Fella. I think you should sit down, fella, or I'll handcuff you to that desk. I've never seen the show. Was that one scene? Cos I found that very difficult to follow. Yeah, yeah, that's er... It's essentially just that for four series. Right, OK. Yeah. I'll give it a go. I mean, it's mad, cos they're in a room just talking about procedure, and you think that's gonna be really, really dull, and it's so brilliant, isn't it? It's so, so well done. Beautifully written. Now, Rhianna, Black Mirror? Yes, we did start the decade with someone essentially having sex with a pig in a drama, and we sort of ended it with a prime minister genuinely having sex with a pig. Allegedly. Which is... That's a funny... Oh, come on, he did it. Were you there? Were you there? Did you see? He is not gonna sue. Like he wants anyone to know where he is. We've got... That's very true. ...we've got a good clean ten years of Cameron not showing his face. Erm, anyone here a fan of Great British Bake Off? Yes. Are you? Yes. No, it's too tense. It's supposed to be about scones. It's only one tent and they're all in... But it's too... it's too stressful. Er, see, I think Bake Off, I like Bake Off because I don't think it's stressful at all. I'm gonna show you a clip now. I think that if this is the most stressful thing that's ever happened in your series, it's not a stressful series. Oh, man, that was awful. Oh, it's... Oh, it's going, it's going. BLEEP It's gonna fall. BLEEP Oh, God. No! Oh, BLEEP. Oh, man. Oh, my God. I mean... Too tense. Noel's thinking, "This is the best thing that's happened "since I got this job." Er, what do we think should win this group, everybody? Oh. But Black Mirror was brilliant, but the Star Trek episode... That's a good one. Absolutely. I know, but then Line Of Duty. Yeah, I like... And then Ru Paul, how can you not have Ru Paul? Oh, Lorraine, it's great to have you on the show. I'd say Line Of Duty. You're going Line Of Duty. Rhianna? Lorraine? I'm gonna say Ru Paul. Jon? I think the only show there that is so successful we'd turn the world into a spin-off episode is Black Mirror. Black Mirror. Well, let's find out what was fourth on the list. What came last? Drag Race. Awwww! Just 6% for Drag Race. What came third? Black Mirror, 26%. So who's going through to the semifinal? It's either gonna be Line Of Duty, or it's gonna be Great British Bake Off. Audience, what would you like? AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT ANSWERS I think that was 48/52, so let's... let that go, shall we? Er, our first semifinalist in The World Cup Of The Decade, Best TV Show is... Line Of Duty goes first. Yay. Line Of Duty. It is brilliant. Oh, it's fantastic. It is brilliant. If you haven't seen it, do try and... It's genius. Catch up on it. It's terrific stuff. Line Of Duty is through to the semifinal. What's it gonna face? It's gonna face the winner of these four TV shows. And they are Gogglebox. Yeah! Killing Eve. Brilliant. Planet Earth 2, and Game Of Thrones. There's some big hitters in this, everything's a big hitter though, it's only 16 shows from across the whole decade. What does anyone fancy there? APPLAUSE I have to say, I've never seen a frame of Game Of Thrones. Not one single one. I haven't either, Lorraine. Have you not? I thought I was the only person, I'm so happy. I do know there's a dragon in it and a man called Jon Snow and they tell him he doesn't know anything, but that's about it. I know that, and there's something about winter is coming, I think there are breasts, I think that's correct. Oh, go on, then. Is it something you know? I've never said this before - what do you think at home, how many breasts are there in Game Of Thrones? This is a fun game to play with your kids. Erm... Rhianna, how many breasts are there in Game Of Thrones? 134 breasts?! That's one penis a season. To be fair, though, winter is coming, so it may have been more. So, yeah, they do... I tell you who I'm worried for - the viewer at home who's just answered this and got it right in front of all of their family. Very true. Let's move on, shall we, to Gogglebox. Fans... fans of Gogglebox? Yes. Yes. Of course we love Gogglebox because it's good, firstly, Lorraine, and second, we know they're watching us. So, you've gotta be nice, haven't you? I mean, listen, I love the Siddiquis. If you're watching, guys, lovely to see ya! Because they might feature this. Who are your least favourite Goggleboxers, Jon? I think, at best, you need one posh family, that would be my comment. Giles and Mary. Giles and Mary'll do. And Steph and Dom in their day... Yeah... had a role to play. Nowadays, sometimes there's three or four posh families, and that doesn't do it for me. Does it not? I would, and I'm a huge fan of the show, I think it's one of the best things on telly. There are people now watching they'll be intercutting, there'll be people going, "I hope he's not talking about us, darling." Pass the Cointreau. Er, that is Gogglebox. Now, Planet Earth 2... Oh. ..er, is a wonderful show. Shall we take a little look at Planet Earth 2? Please. So many clips we could've chosen. I know. Er, here's a very, very tense clip, though. You'll all remember this one. It's like a proper Hollywood car chase, except the cars are an iguana and some snakes. Oh, yeah. TENSE MUSIC PLAYS Phew! Thank the Lord! Oh, my God. Oh! Nearly as tense as Bake Off. That was tense. That was tense. The more I watch that clip, the more it's like watching Arsenal defend. There's loads of them around him, how's he got through there? That's not like the Daily Mail... ...to accuse someone of fakery. No? Probably a younger iguana who'd had a bit of Botox. It would've been a bit cruel to let him get to the top and then put him back. Last one in this group, Killing Eve, this is essentially a show about two women who want to kill each other, it's the Coleen Rooney, Rebecca Vardy story, essentially. Er, fans of Killing Eve? Oh, I love it. Isn't it the best? Absolutely fantastic. And Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who I suspect we'll be seeing a little bit more of later. No spoilers, but I wonder if one of her other shows has qualified for our 16. Oh, I would think so. Erm, shall we take a look at what came last in this group? Gogglebox came last. OK, OK. I've gone on record of saying I disagree with that, I would've put it first, Goggleboxers. 13%. Er, in third place? Oh. Planet Earth 2? Oh, that's... that's a shocker. That's crazy, so Killing Eve versus Game Of Thrones. What do we think's gonna win this one? Killing Eve. You think? Yeah. Game Of Thrones. Game Of Thrones? Let's take a look. Erm, going through to the semifinals to play Line Of Duty is... Game Of Thrones goes through. Oh. OK. OK. There is our first semifinal right there, Line Of Duty versus Game Of Thrones. We will get to that in a moment. It's time for a break - see you in a minute. Welcome back to World Cup of the Decade. Now, we were discussing the TV Show of the Decade. Two more groups to go. Here is group C. What is going to win this? What's going through to the semifinal from this? You could have Peaky Blinders, Derry Girls, Downton Abbey, or Love Island, which is a Downton Abbey spin-off. LAUGHTER Some pretty good ones on that, isn't there? I'm not criticising the draw but I think Gogglebox pisses that group, I think. You reckon? Yeah. APPLAUSE Derry Girls is my childhood, Derry Girls. It's just like... I just loved it so much, I laughed so much. Shall we have a little look at a clip of Derry Girls? Oh, it's so good. It's such a wonderful ensemble piece. Here's a clip where you see all the girls together and they've got such amazing chemistry. I love them. Look, whatever happens in there we have to stick together, OK? We have to back each other up. HYSTERICALLY: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, OK, I was there, I admit that. But I didn't do anything! It was Michelle! It was all Michelle! I'm not going down for something I didn't do! If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE The wonderful Derry Girls. Um, Love Island. Any Love Island fans here? Yeah! They asked me to go on Celebrity Love Island, but I said, "Look, if all I want to do is get a tan and sleep with a celebrity, I'll do Strictly." LAUGHTER SCATTERED BOOS Don't boo that - they should stop fucking each other. That's the... LAUGHTER Alex, are you a fan of Love Island? I just love everything about it. I love the drama. I mean, it's got drama. Oh, yeah, for sure. It's got comedy. I love the fact that they've managed to get young British people to go to Majorca and have sex, and who would have thought that was possible? WQW! And if we could just get them off the electoral register. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Is that true, nearly 100 thousand people? That's what I did this evening with the panel. Um, now, Peaky Blinders. I love Peaky Blinders. I love Derry Girls and I love Peaky Blinders, two of my favourite shows in the same group here. Super sweary, Rhianna, right, Peaky Blinders? This sounds like Love Island so far. LAUGHTER Oh. It was originally called Brum Loving Criminals. LAUGHTER I genuinely love Peaky Blinders. Here's a lovely clip from Peaky Blinders. It does have a bit of swearing, but it shows how kind of... It can be very violent, but also funny and also so beautifully acted. Let's take a little look at the clip, just before Tommy Shelby's wedding. But the main thing is, you bunch of fuckers, despite the provocation from the cavalry, no fighting. Oi. No fighting. No fucking fighting. No fighting. No fucking fighting! Good. Get the fuck away. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE That was fantastic. There's something about that swearing in that accent that's just really... Well, especially if Cillian Murphy's doing it. "Satisfying. Yeah. It's managed to make the Birmingham accent sound quite cool. Well, its managed to make about 40 different variations of the Birmingham accent soundcool. The last one on the list - Downton Abbey. Some people don't watch Downton because they think it's a bit too gentle. I have to say, every time I watch it, it seems just to be Maggie Smith tutting because they've installed a landline. Have you ever seen any Downton, Jon? No, I'm afraid not. There's so many other channels, um... LAUGHTER So, listen, time to make a choice. What would we like to win this group? Alex? For me it's between Love Island and Peakys. I probably... Do you know what, I'd probably say - and don't hate me for it - Love Island. Listen, man, someone's got to do it. Rhianna? Lorraine? Derry Girls. Derry Girls as well. Jon? We should get some comedy through. Let's get Derry Girls. Derry Girls as well. So three for Derry Girls, one for Love Island. What do you think at home? Let's find out what came last in this poll. Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry. Oh, well. I'm so sorry. People don't know good telly when they see it. 10%. What was third? Downton with 16%. Interesting! So Peaky Blinders versus Derry Girls. Oh! Still in there with a shout, Derry Girls. Let's take a look. What did the public say on Twitter? Peaky Blinders. That is our third semifinalist. We have three semifinalists, one more to go. There's Line of Duty versus Game of Thrones. Peaky Blinders is going to play the winner of this last group. And it is... ...Fleabag... Oh, genius. ...Stranger Things, The Only Way ls Essex... I know, right? I know. LAUGHTER Come on. ...and Sherlock. That is this group. Let's take a look at Sherlock, shall we? Huge hit, started in 2010, Sherlock. Oh, it's good. It's gone all around the world. It has fans everywhere in the world. We've got a picture here, I think, of Justin Trudeau who went as Sherlock to his last Halloween party... I don't think he did it particularly well. You'll be the judge of that. ...which is good news cos his second choice was Luther, so... LAUGHTER Oh, dear. Fans of Sherlock? Very much so. Sometimes a wee bit too clever for its own good, but very well done. You like a bit of Sherlock, Jon? Do love a bit of Sherlock, yeah. Yeah, it's good. And all the words on the screen and all that. I like that, yeah. I like that, it's great. There's loads of fan fiction for Sherlock. They do fan fiction where Holmes and Watson get up to stuff, right. Oh, they do that with Star Trek. Yeah, well, they do it for Pointless. Right? Do they? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do they really? Tell me everything. Tell me everything. Everybody in this room - and at home - is imagining you having sex with Alexander Armstrong. That's all I'm doing. Because normally, normally it's just me imagining that. It's nice... It's nice to be able to share it. JON IMITATES POINTLESS COUNTDOWN LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Listen, Fleabag is the last on my list. Oh. Yes. Killing Eve already knocked out, but Fleabag has been... I mean, an extraordinary show of the decade. Oh, absolutely fantastic. There's nothing bad to say about it and in the second series we had the hot priest, so that was even better. Ah, the hot priest. So, yeah. Shall we take a little look at the hot priest? But we'll take a look also at Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the genius behind the show. This is where she traditionally breaks the fourth wall. I'd really like to be your friend, though. I'd like to be your friend too. We'll last a week. What was that? What? Where did you... Where did you just go? What? You just... went somewhere. There. There. Where did you just go? SHE CHUCKLES Nowhere. Ah, Fleabag there. And Andrew Scott, to be fair, does look exactly like a cross between Ant and Dec. LAUGHTER I mean, that is definitely true. Let's find out our final semifinalist, shall we? Last in this group, can you believe it? It's The Only Way ls Essex, with 2% of the votes. Third place in this group... Oh, get out of it. Oh, no! That's a shock. Shocker. 28% . British public... No. ...what are they thinking? There are a lot of women who want to see a priest get noshed off in there. LAUGHTER Is that what women want? That happened, didn't it? Did it? Yeah, I think, yeah, something happened, didn't it? She gets down and... I never saw that. No, but that was part of the ritual of the... ...of the religious theme. Was it not? I mean... Quite how you got to your age, Lorraine... LAUGHTER No, it's all part of the ceremony. It's part of the ritual, you know. That was a very milky communion. Oh! GROANS Lorraine literally just made the sign of the cross at you there. Our final semifinalist for the World Cup of the Decade TV Show is... ...Sherlock. APPLAUSE That's fair enough. OK. Here are our semifinals - Line of Duty will play Game of Thrones, Peaky Blinders will play Sherlock. One of those four is the Best TV Show of the Decade, according to our huge Twitter poll. First semifinal, Line of Duty versus Game of Thrones. Who do we think's going to win? Alex? Line of Duty. Rhianna? Line of Duty. Gogglebox. LAUGHTER I'm with Jon. I agree, Gogglebox. I can tell you this one was 49/51. Wow. Those were the numbers. GASPS Our first finalist in the World Cup of the Decade Best TV Show is... Game of Thrones just takes it. No, no, no. APPLAUSE I guess it's understandable. Hm. Second semifinal. What's going to play Game of Thrones in that final - Peaky Blinders or Sherlock? Alex? I'd like to think Peaky Blinders. I'd love Peaky Blinders. Rhianna? Lorraine? I'll... I don't mind. Sherlock. They're both brilliant. Jon? It's flat cap versus deerstalker, isn't it, I guess, so... It kind of is. I'll go flat cap. You go flat for... You're going Peaky. I'd go Peaky as well and we know what that means. It means that Sherlock's almost certainly going to win. Audience, Peaky or Sherlock? AUDIENCE: The audience is going for Sherlock. Let's find out what is playing Game of Thrones in the final. It is... Oh, no. Sherlock. APPLAUSE AND CHEERS Sherlock v Game of Thrones. Listen, we have the small matter of a final to attend to. Yes. It's the World Cup of the Decade, but what is the Best Television Show of the Decade? We know it's Game of Thrones or Sherlock. Anyone got a big favourite here? Game of Thrones, then. Sherlock. Sherlock, but I think Thrones will win. Two each. You think Game of Thrones will win? Yeah. Let's take a look. The Best TV Show of the Decade is... ...Sherlock is our winner. Sherlock is our winner. Congratulations to Sherlock. Let's just show one little clip in celebration of Sherlock. This is Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch in a wonderful scene from the Best TV Show Of The Decade, Sherlock. Well, I'd better be off. So nice to have had a proper chat. What if I was to shoot you now? Right now. Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face... ...cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock. Really, I would. And just a teensy bit... "disappointed. And, of course, you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes. Catch you... "later. IN SING-SONG VOICE: No, you won't. DOOR SLAMS SHUT Oh, it is good, it is good. Ladies and gentlemen, The Best TV Show Of The Decade, Sherlock. Now, I think it's important for all of us, at this point in the show, maybe to pause, maybe to reflect on some of the things that we've lost along the way in this decade. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER AUDIENCE: LAUGHTER AUDIENCE: Who is she?! Who is she?! Who is she? Where did you find her? LAUGHTER Obama out. APPLAUSE AND CHEERS I honestly... I honestly thought I was going to make it through that and then Ceefax turned up. I couldn't deal with it. Those are the things we've lost along the way this decade. Join us after the break, please, where we'll be finding out The Best Song Of The Decade. Hello, there, welcome back to World Cup Of The Decade. Before the break, we discovered the Best TV Show of the Decade was Sherlock, according to our huge Twitter poll. We're about to find out the Best Song of the Decade. Again, 16 finalists, we draw them in to four groups, the winner of each group goes through to our semifinals, shall we have a little listen to the songs in group one? # She's up all night till the sun # I'm up all night to get some # She's up all night for good fun # I'm up all night to get lucky... # # I let my guard down # And then you pulled the rug # I was getting kind of used to being someone you loved... # # Hey, I just met you # And this is crazy # But here's my number # So call me maybe # It's hard to look right at you, baby # But here's my number # So call me maybe... # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Banger after banger, there. All killer, no filler. Any favourites there? I absolutely love Call Me Maybe. It's a good song, right? Genuinely, I had it as my ringtone for a little while when it first came out. I absolutely love it, I mean, it's terrible advice, dishing your number out left, right and centre, but what a great song. Also, great video. Not in a pervy way. LAUGHTER Video Games, that might be one of my favourite songs of the decade. Yeah? She wrote it about sort of just hanging out with her boyfriend who was playing World of Warcraft. Oh, yeah. I thought it was a bit meh. Really? Yeah. Lewis Capaldi just, amazing. Lewis Capaldi? Oh, he's your favourite? Love him, Lewis, he's my favourite, I just think he's so cute and so gorgeous and so funny and he doesn't take himself very seriously. He is brilliantly self-deprecating as well. He's got this little documentary called Becoming Lewis Capaldi, there's a little clip here where he goes through this tough process of writing lyrics. This book right here's just, I just constantly, I write something, I can write something now, "I love you, I love you, why did you leave me? "Please don't leave me, seriously, please don't leave me. "I love you, please don't leave me. "Don't leave me. "I don't want to live with my parents any more." I adore him. He's wonderful. You've gotta like the guy. He's wonderful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He really is. I don't... A couple of years ago, he was nowhere, and now he's one of the biggest stars in the world. I've had gigs like that. LAUGHTER Huge fan of Lewis Capaldi. Now, Get Lucky by Daft Punk was an absolutely huge song, I met one of Daft Punk the other day. I had a Deliveroo. LAUGHTER Um, so, but we know who they are, right? They're a couple of French guys. Darren Anderton and Teddy Sherringham. Yeah. So let's find our fourth placed song first. Video Games. I love that song, anyway, 12% for that. Third place? Oh, Don't Call Me, Carly Rae, 21%, so it's between, Get Lucky by Daft Punk, a classic from the middle of the decade and the new kind of hot kid on the block, Lewis Capaldi with Someone You Loved. Um, let's find out, what's our first semifinalist in the Best Song of the Decade? I mean, it had to be, right? I think it had to be. APPLAUSE So Get Lucky by Daft Punk is our first semifinalist. What is it going to play in its semifinal? One of these four songs. # Cos all of me # Loves all of you # Love your curves and all your edges # All your perfect imperfections... # # Cos the players gonna play, play, play, play, play # And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate # Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake # I shake it off I shake it off... # # Never mind, I'll find someone like you # I wish nothing but the best for you too... # Oh. Four good songs there. APPLAUSE That is a tough group. Now, you won't have seen while that was on, two of the members of our panel, namely me and Lorraine, I think our favourite song is the same one. Which is Despacito, right? It's so good. I love Despacito. So, so good. What a fantastic song. We do Zumba to that. We shake everything. It's so... But it's quite hard to sing along to, right? No-one knows the words, but it doesn't stop you, you know, you just kinda put in, you know... # One day I saw a mosquito # Which had some chilli heatwave Doritos... # You just kind of make your own. I think that is the lyrics to the song. I've never heard that song until now. You've never heard Despacito? It's so good. They don't really play it in Morrison's. Now John Legend, All of Me, best-selling single of 2014, he also got voted the sexiest man in the world, right? All Of Me is like, it's one of those songs that's, like, so many people have had it as their, like, first dance. It was in the mixer for mine. The lyrics didn't really resonate with me, cos as someone who's, like, missing bits... LAUGHTER If the lyrics had been, like, # What remains of me... # LAUGHTER Then I could've got on board. Yeah, come on, Jon, I didn't think All Of Me is John Legend's best song of the decade even. This is a man who can make anything sound amazing, I think this is John Legend's best song of the decade. # Somebody's got a stinky boo... # I may need some backup on this one. Guys? # Somebody Somebody # Got a stinky So stinky # Booty Booty, booty, booty... # APPLAUSE When I change my kids' nappies, I'm too busy retching to sing. And the final one on that group, Taylor Swift's advice to any man standing at a urinal, Shake It Off, big fans of, any fans of that song? You're not gonna shake it off. Shake it a bit, but not till it comes off. LAUGHTER No. Just give it a little wiggle. So what's gonna win this group, do we think? It's a tough one. Adele. I hope Despacito. I would love to think Despacito, I don't think we've got a hope in hell, love, I think it's got to be Adele, don't you? OK, now let's find out what came fourth. Oh, get outa town. Boo. Get outa town. 13%. It'll always be our song. It's our song, it is. And third place. John Legend. Not so cocky now, are you, John? It's between Someone Like You and Shake it Off to be our second semifinalist. The second semifinalist is...? Adele gets through, well done, Adele. APPLAUSE There she is, taking her place in the semifinal against Get Lucky by Daft Punk. Um, shall we look at group three? Best Song of the Decade, what is it? Is it one of these four? # ..hallelujah # Girls hit your hallelujah # Girls hit your hallelujah # Cos uptown funk gon' give it to you # Cos uptown funk gon' give it to you # Cos uptown funk gon' give it to you # Saturday night and we in the spot # Don't believe me just watch... # # Who run this motha, girls # Who run this motha, girls # Who run this motha, girls # Who run this motha, girls # Who run the world? Girls # Who run the world? Girls # Who run the world? Girls # Who run the world? Girls... # APPLAUSE Now, the more numerate amongst you would've spotted there was only three clips there and that's cos the last one, Do I Wanna Know by Arctic Monkeys, we couldn't play it because they're too cool, and so we then found a clip of a guy playing it on the guitar with his dog accompanying him on snare drum, and they said, "No, you can't have that one either." So, what do we think on that one? Uptown Funk, absolutely huge hit, lots of people have claimed to have written it, right? Lots of lawsuits. Oh, I was gonna say about that song, the reason I like it is it sounds like it could've been from sort of any decade. Mm. And it turns out it is from any decade. Shape Of You, Ed Sheeran, an absolutely enormous hit record, Shape Of You, anyone Ed Sheeran fans here? Oh, yeah, you have to be, it's the law. He's like the Lewis Capaldi of the early 2010s, isn't he? The whole decade. Billions. Arctic Monkeys, though, are you a fan? Um, I've never heard the song and now I know I'm not gonna tonight. Am I allowed to whistle it? Yeah. Oh, I'm smiling now, I can't whistle. What's going on? It's hard to, it's hard to whistle when you're smiling. Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jon Richardson. The Northern Monkeys. V00. LAUGHTER I'm really nervous now. I've never whistled on telly before. Right, come on. HE WHISTLES DO I WANNA KNOW? APPLAUSE You'll kick yourself, you remember it now, don't you? Alex Turner is a genius, isn't he? Yeah. Let's take a look, shall we, at what came fourth in this group, gonna find another semifinalist, it is not going to be... Beyonce. Oh! 10%, that's a surprise. In third place was... ...Ed Sheeran. No! In third place, knocked out, 16%. See, maybe people are fed up with it. Arctic Monkeys or Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, what's going through to our semifinal? It's Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, Uptown Funk. That's fair enough again. Come on. What is it gonna play in that semifinal? It's gonna play one of these four songs, or once again one of these three songs because someone else wouldn't let us play their song. I'll tell you what it is after these. # I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, # Dancing through the fire # Cos I am a champion # And you're going to hear me roar... # # I know when that hotline bling # That can only mean one thing # I know when that hotline bling # That can only mean one thing... # APPLAUSE The song we're not allowed to play there, the fourth song is Happy by Pharrell. If you do want to listen to Happy, by the way, just call a mini cab, it'll be playing, you can hear it. I saw a statistic about Happy, it said "If you listen to every single stream of that back-to-back, "it would take you back to the time when they built Stonehenge." That's how far back it would go. Wow. Which, of course, is a room without a roof, so it is apt. Any fans of Sia? Is it really? That's quite strident for a ringtone. They must love you in a quiet carriage. Shall we take a look at what has won this group? Let's see what came fourth. Hotline Bling. Do you think? That was my favourite of those. Really? OK. No, he didn't. No, he didn't. That's like the sort of thing that someone says down the pub, "Came out with Yolo, didn't ya?" Third place. Katy Perry, it's 15%. Oh. So it's either Happy by Pharrell, or it's Chandelier by Sia. What's gonna be our final semifinalist, Best Song of the Decade, it is... Happy by Pharrell. Gotta be. Got to be. APPLAUSE So let's take a look at those semifinalists, so it is three very similar songs there, Get Lucky, Uptown Funk and Happy, and Adele, flying the flag there for the UK. First semifinal, Get Lucky by Daft Punk versus Someone Like You, Adele. Alex, what's winning this one? Get Lucky. Rhianna? Lorraine? I think Adele. You think Adele. Mn? Yeah, I found myself rooting for Adele. I would root for Adele, I think she's great. Um, let's find our first finalist World Cup of the Decade Best Song, is it gonna be Get Lucky or is it gonna be Someone Like You? ALL: Oh! 51/49. Well done, Adele. APPLAUSE We've gotta hand it to her, what is Adele playing in the final? It's gonna be one of these two songs. Uptown Funk versus Happy by Pharrell. What do you think's gonna win this, Alex? Uptown Funk. Rhianna? Oh, really? Lorraine? Uptown Funk for me. Jon? Gogglebox. Really? I'm gonna go Uptown Funk as well. So let's take a look, shall we, what's playing Adele in the final? Uptown Funk, Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. APPLAUSE So our final is Someone Like You by Adele against Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson. We're about to find out the Best Song of the Decade as voted on Twitter. What is it, though, World Cup of the Decade Best Song, it is... Uptown Funk takes it, Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Fair enough, I think. We've had Sherlock, winner of the Best TV Show, we've had Uptown Funk, winner of the Best Song. After the break, we're gonna find the Best New Thing of the Decade. Join us then. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Hello, there. Welcome back to World Cup Of The Decade. We've already discovered the, Best TV Show Of The Decade. That was Sherlock. We've discovered the Best Song Of The Decade. Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. We're now going to look at the Best New Thing Of The Decade. It's something that emerged after 2010. We'll go straight to the semifinals. I'll tell you a few things that got knocked out before the semis. We lost onesies, we lost Greggs vegan sausage rolls, and we lost the Higgs boson. We only just found that. Let's take a look at our semifinals, shall we? The first one is... These are things that are new since 2010. Emojis versus Uber. Emojis versus... Anyone use both? Yeah. The monkey with its hands over its eyes emoji is... Yeah? ...on its own is one of the greatest inventions of all time because it manages to soften bad news perfectly. It's like, you know, if your wide texts you and says, "I've gone into labour. Where are you?" and you reply with, "I'm at the pub," you sound ignorant. If you reply with, "I'm at the pub"... LAUGHTER ..it's like, "I know what I married, "He's a cheeky little scamp, isn't he? And that's how you won Dad Of The Year. Some people... We think we know what all these emojis mean. Can I show you a terrifying clip from American TV that tells us sometimes we don't know the whole truth about emojis? To young people, emojis can mean different things and cyber experts say kids are starting to use some as a secret code that we, as parents, can't necessarily figure out. A skull, arrow and a flame - that can be saying to someone "I hope you die in a fire." LAUGHTER just to give you a couple more examples, we're bringing Casey in to give her a little quiz here because some of these are so simple. Yeah, a flower. A flower. You think that's just a flower, right? It means you want to bring your mother flowers. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah! It can also mean drugs. What do you think? We've got two eyeballs here. I'm watching you. Yes, that's one of them. Oh, but, like, literally? Again, these have a lot of different meanings, so, that can mean "I'm watching you," but we're always worried about sexting and this can also mean "Send me naked pictures of you." Oh, my God! LAUGHTER When he sees the poo with the smiley face... LAUGHTER Who are these 7% of people who are tweeting...? They think, "Oh, I just need to tweet about a peach." Now, emojis are taking on Uber, which is a thing of this decade isn't it? But now, enormously successful, Uber. Uber was spoilt for me when I realised that I was getting rated as well... Yes, yes... and I didn't... How the fuck did I end up a 4.4 out of five just by sitting down? LAUGHTER I don't understand it. It's like... I think that's one of the greatest advan... Uber and Airbnb and things where you are rated as a consumer, there's not enough of that. Oh, really? It's just another way to shine. LAUGHTER I just, you know... I want people to know I'm better at being in a taxi than other people. I screengrab... What's your Uber rating? 4.99. Everybody, Jon Richardson. APPLAUSE What do we think has won this, emojis or Uber? What's in the final? Emojis. Emojis. Oh, God. Let's have a little look. Emojis or Uber? Smiley face. It's emojis. APPLAUSE One additional fact there - emojis and Uber paid the same amount of tax in the UK last year. LAUGHTER The next semifinal is... Two new things. Instagram, I understand. Fitbits got through to the semifinal. Anyone use a Fitbit? I used to. I used to, but then, you know that you're supposed to do 10,000 steps? Yes. But then, I would get really, really close and it would be bedtime, and I'd be walking up and down my bedroom trying to make it burst the 10,000 and I thought, that's really sad, so I put it in a drawer and I forgot all about it. I gave it a proper go. I did it for, like, three clays, and... LAUGHTER But I did start thinking, if you had done your 10,000 steps every day for the decade, I'm going to show you how far you could have gone, if you were just walking. Oh. If we start in London, OK? This is if you'd done 10,000 steps a day, you could have walked all the way - I mean, good luck across the sea - to New York. We don't stop there. We then walk all the way down to Buenos Aires, and we then walk all the way back to London, and we've still got 200 miles leftover, so we can go to Hull. LAUGHTER 10,000 steps a day! APPLAUSE That is amazing. Amazing, right? Instagram fans? I like Instagram cos it's kind. You're good on Instagram. I'm going to compare your Instagram to Jon's Instagram. Go on, then. There's a couple of pictures from Lorraine's. Here's a beautifully shot... I think by a professional photographer, this must be. You as Lady Gaga. Look at that. I mean, look at the composition on that. LAUGHTER Yeah, I mean, come on. And they're real, them ones. LAUGHTER Here's you at a Pride march. Awww. Lovely Lorraine there. They're gorgeous. And, Jon, here is a picture of your... ...cutlery drawer. Yay! LAUGHTER It's very neat. APPLAUSE Very neat. Who's got the most Instagram followers in the world, Rhianna? Like, the Kardashian? Beyonce or... Cristiano Ronaldo. Really?! Wow. What do we think's won this? What's in the final? Instagram or Fitbits? Instagram. Instagram. Must be, surely, Instagram. Let's take a look. What's going through to the final to play emojis? It is... ...Instagram. Look at it there. APPLAUSE Emojis versus Instagram - one of these is the Best New Thing Of The Decade. But which one is it? What do we think? One word, Alex? Emojis. Rhianna? Lorraine? I think Instagram. You think lnsta. This will be a really good bit of footage to show when we don't get to the end of the next decade because the world is on fire. Yes. This, this debate here will be... LAUGHTER ...this is what I'll show to my daughter. Just say, "Look at the fun we were having." I noticed that electric cars didn't make it past emojis and that's why we now live in a boat. LAUGHTER I asked you one question. What's going to win, emojis or Instagram? Oh, emojis. Let's take a look, shall we? The Best New Thing Of The Decade is... ...emojis, by an absolute mile. APPLAUSE So, we have three winners already. We have Sherlock, we have Uptown Funk, and we have emojis. Join us after the break, please, where we'll be finding out the winner of the Best Film Of The Decade. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to The World Cup Of The Decade. We've come to our final category. It is a big one, though. We're going to find the Best Film Of The Decade. We've got 16 finalists here. Everyone voted on Twitter - millions of votes. Here is our first group, here are our first four films. We've got Bohemian Rhapsody. AUDIENCE MEMBERS LAUGH Joker. Wolf Of Wall Street and Frozen. What have we got as favourites in that one, everybody? Nice. Yeah, I haven't seen Frozen. I know that Elsa is a very strong, powerful, feminist hero, I know that because I've seen this clip of Elsa. Let's take a look at it. AUDIENCE LAUGHS BYSTANDERS: Yeah! Whoo! Beautiful. APPLAUSE That is Frozen. So Bohemian Rhapsody, Rhianna, had a very troubled start. I wish it hadn't but, yes, it did have a really... I like Bo Rhap. It did have a really troubled production because obvi... They had different directors coming in and out. Sacha Baron Cohen was supposed to be playing Freddie Mercury before Rami Malek. Can you imagine? He wanted to take it down a really dark, serious tone, and they obviously didn't go quite that way. Erm, and then Rami Malek obviously had to... ...had to keep those teeth in for a whole production. But he won an Oscar for it, so it won a... He did. It made a billion dollars. It's nice to see Frozen up against Wolf Of Wall Street, two very similar... LAUGHTER Let's take a little look at Wolf Of Wall Street. So, there's a clip. Remember the clip of Matthew McConaughey pounding his chest? Yes. And that was improvised, right? Is it something he just...? That's something that he does before every film just to calm himself down, and Leonardo DiCaprio witnessed this one day and was like, "We need to get this in the film." Cos it does look like he's an awful coke-ridden banker when he does it. So, that's actors for you. Let's take a little look. RHYTHMIC BEATING Hey-um. Hey-um-mm. Hey-um. Umm-ha-yeah. Mm-mm-mm-mm-uh. HE WHISTLES THROUGH TEETH Yeah. Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-mm-hm-mm-hm-hm. Mm-hm-hm. Toots ki? APPLAUSE You a fan of Wolf Of Wall Street, Jon? Yes, I liked it when he couldn't get out of the car. Channelled all the great slapstick comedy. It was a very good performance, I have to say. It's a pretty good film, isn't it? Now, Joker is the newest one on the list. Joker up against Frozen in the same group. It's weird, right? Yeah. And we're not allowed to show a clip from Joker cos it's out too recently, which is a shame cos I wanted to show... There's an extraordinary scene where he's coming down the stairs, he's dressed as the Joker for the first time. So, this is someone going downstairs with almost the same amount of dignity, I think, as the Joker, and I think it has the same power and affects us in the same way. Let's take a look. We've now got, oh, hold on a minute, what's going on here? There's two blokes going to go in... LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I mean, you know, that's better than the Joker, isn't it? Yeah. APPLAUSE Erm, so listen, the battle of the big guns here. What do we think's going to win this group? Oof. Frozen. I would like Wolf Of Wall Street to win it. Yeah. Let's take a look. Fourth place is... Oh, come on. Bo Rhap fourth. Look at how happy everyone is apart from me and Lorraine. I know. 18% for that. Third place... Joker. Oh, here we go. Wolf Of Wall Street. How many fucks were there in Wolf Of Wall Street? 506, I think. Right. Over 500. And in Frozen, there's only seven. So it's... LAUGHTER It's a close one. It's a close one. Er, what's going to be our... LAUGHTER Er, what's our first semifinalist? Is it Wolf Of Wall Street? Is it Frozen? Let's find out. Wolf Of Wall Street. Yay! The winner there. First semifinalist. What is Wolf of Wall Street going to play? Let's take a look. It's going to be one of these four films. Oh... Paddington 2. Need we go on? Need we go on after Paddington 2? Deadpool, The Force Awakens. Deadpool. And Get Out. Deadpool, Deadpool is... Yes? ...the best film ever. I loved it so, so much. The best film ever? Well, my favourite film... My favourite film in the world, I suppose, would be Blade Runner. The original, right? The original one. Oh, yeah, oh. But Deadpool... No, the original, yeah. No, the original one. Director's cut, do you know what I mean? You know what? IN COCKNEY ACCENT: I didn't really like the remake. I found it a little bit gauche. All About Eve or that one, but Deadpool is up there. It's absolute... It is a good film. ..perfection. Erm, so, The Force Awakens, that's a Star Wars movie. Not so much kind of with the Marvel cinematic universe, Star Wars less of a big deal this decade. Alex, you a Star Wars fan? I loved Force Awakens. Did you? I absolutely... No! ..loved it. Even though I've come to realise since that it's very much a remake of the original Star Wars. Oh, you spotted that? Yeah. But, it's not often like a sequel's better than the first. Yes. It's not, it's not the Godfather. Godfather. What's... Question is, what's so good about Paddington 2? We've got a little clip of Paddington 2. Shall we see it? Yes, please. It's got an amazing cast of characters in Paddington, a lot of them on screen at one time here when Paddington's family come visit him in prison. We think the thief you saw is part of a criminal gang. Using the pop-up book as a treasure map. Well, it's a theory. Have you found out who they are? Maybe I should take a look. I'm sorry, this is a private conversation. It's all right, Mr Brown. This is my friend, Knuckles. How are you? And this is Fibs. Good day. Spoon. Hello. Jimmy the Snitch. ♪ -Bone. Wotcher. The Professor. Hello. Squeaky Pete. Double Bass Bob. Hello. Farmer Jack. How do? Mad Dog. Johnny Cashpoint. Kerching. Sir Geoffrey Wilcox. I hope I can rely on your vote. And Charlie Russell. Oh! It's so wonderful to meet you all. Such a charming film. A charming film. The other film in this group, Get Out, was an extraordinary film. The only kind of horror we have on our list. Now, let's take a look at what came fourth in that group, shall we? Oh, Alex. Star Wars - The Force Awakens. How's Paddington 2 beaten that? Hugh Grant says it's the best movie he's ever made and to be fair to him, it is. Erm, in third place? Get Out. In third - that's a shame - 20%. So it's between Paddington 2 and DeadpooL DeadpooL Erm, let's find out, shall we? Paddington 2 or Deadpool? What's our next semifinalist? Deadpool. Yay! Woohoo! There we go. APPLAUSE So, Deadpool is up against Wolf of Wall Street in our first semifinal. Oh, that's tough. It's a tough one, isn't it? That's really hard, that's really hard. Er, lot of "fucks" there. Erm, our next semifinal, one of them's going to come from this group. Black Panther, La La Land, Furious... Sorry, it's supposed to say Moonlight, erm... Furious 7, which is also the name of the WhatsApp group of the mothers of Boris Johnson's children... LAUGHTER ...and Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3. Any big favourites there? Black Panther, a huge movie. First Marvel movie to winan Oscar. It was a great story cos sometimes with movies they forget to write a really, really good proper story, and proper characters. That's what I loved about that. Some of the Marvel films are great. My favourite's Thor 3, that's my favourite Marvel film. There can't be a Thor 3? Why are you all saying... I know. Thor 3, Thor 3 should follow on from Frozen 2. LAUGHTER La La Land. Any fans of La La Land? Feel like I'm in La La land. I've not seen La La Land. Oh, it's rubbish. And I don't want to see it. I didn't like it. Rubbish. Whereas Furious 7, if they did that as a musical I would've watched it. Toy Story 3's gotta be a big favourite in this group, shall we take a little look? A lovely film but also very, very funny at times. Here's a clip, it illustrates quite how funny Toy Story can be. Where's the manual? Oh, all right, here we go. There should be a little hole under the switch. Little hole. Got it. "To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert paperclip." Rex, use your finger. What? GRUNTS OK, now what? All right, let's see. "Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds." JINGLE It's not my fault. BEEPS SPEAKS SPANISH Now what did you do? I just did what you told me. Uh. Amigos. We're all amigos. We gotta switch him back. How lovely. Brilliant. I mean, that is a great scene. Erm, what do we think's going to win this group? What would you like to win this group? I've not... Furious 7 has to... There's never been seven good anything. Thing is though, if I've not seen the first six, am I going to be able to pick it up seven in? Do you know what? You will. Yeah. You pretty much will. Shall we take another look, see what came last in this group? Oh, Furious 7. Just 3% for Furious 7. Erm, third place? La La Land, 16%. So it's between Black Panther and Toy Story 3. Both worthy winners. Oh, I think so. I would say. Both of them. Let's find out. Our third semifinalist is? Toy Story 3. APPLAUSE So we have three semifinalists so far. Deadpool and Wolf of Wall Street and then Toy Story. Three very different movies. Oh, it's so hard. Three very different movies. What's going to be our fourth semifinalist? Going to be one of these four films. And they are: Bridesmaids - nice to see a proper good old comedy there. Avengers Assemble, which is the one where they go to Ikea, buy some flat-pack furniture. Erm, The Lego Movie and Inception. Those are the four movies there. Oof, that's a tough choice, isn't it? Avengers Assemble, there's been loads of great Marvel movies, we put that in just because it sort of feels like the beginning of that kind of golden age. Now, quite often we hear things about people who've given away spoilers. I want to show you a clip here where Mark Ruffalo, who's the Hulk, I think he really is giving away a spoiler here and the reason I think he is is he's being interviewed with Don Cheadle, and take a look at Don Cheadle's face when Mark Ruffalo says the things he's saying. I think Mark Ruffalo is not supposed to be saying what he's saying. It's a lot of fun. Did you succeed in saving it? I can't... Can I say it? No. I would imagine you guys... Can I just give 'em a little, a little taste? I wouldn't say too much but you can say as much... I mean, hey, it's your career. Let me just say this - like every other Marvel movie, it doesn't end well for the superheroes. That's true. In Marvel it doesn't end that well, somebody always dies or gets really badly hurt. Wait til you see this next one, everybody dies. Dude! LAUGHTER I may be wrong in that part. Yeah, can you... You'll cut that bit. That's not... LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Jon, have you seen Inception? Yes, I did see it. Did you understand what was going on? I think I did at the time. It's the sort of film I enjoyed and never want to see again. Yeah. It's possible, though, that we're still watching it. No. Don't, don't, don't. Don't, don't. Lego Movie, anyone seen Lego Movie? I have one fact about it - which is that it's the most uncomfortable movie to stand on. That's the only, that's the only fact I have. And Bridesmaids, nice to see a comedy making a lot of money. Proper funny. Is that what you'd go for in this group? Yeah. Comedy, it's really hard to do comedy. Being just really funny about real life and getting married, that's hard. Well, listen, as your career proves. LAUGHTER Wonderful. Erm, shall we find our final semifinalist? What is going up against Toy Story 3? In fourth place it is... The Lego Movie, 17%. OK. In third place? Ah, there goes Bridesmaids. Inception and Avengers Assemble, you would assume Avengers Assemble. Let's take a look. What's our fourth semifinalist? Inception is our fourth semifinalist. APPLAUSE We've got our semifinals for the Best Film of the Decade. Join us after the break, we'll playing those semifinals and then we'll be finding the Best Film of the Decade. See you in a bit. APPLAUSE Hello there, welcome back to World Cup Of The Decade. We left you on a cliffhanger, we left you with the four semifinalists for the Best Film of the Decade. Let's take a look at what they are. We have Wolf Of Wall Street versus Deadpool and we have Toy Story 3 versus Inception. Wolf Of Wall Street or Deadpool, what do we think's going to win that? Deadpool! OK, thank you, Lorraine. Anybody else have an opinion, or? Wolf Of Wall Street. He was the first person to. He invented Wows. Let's find out what our first finalist in the Best Film of the Decade is. Wolf Of Wall Street. Boo! Wolf Of Wall Street. Boo. That's annoyed Lorraine. What is Wolf Of Wall Street going to face in that final? Is it Toy Story 3 or is it Inception? Let's find out. Yes. Toy Story, safely through. APPLAUSE So, we have our final. Lot of films released this decade. We narrowed it down to 16 on Twitter, they narrowed it down to two, we are now down to those final two. And they are Wolf Of Wall Street versus Toy Story 3. Very, very similar films. Erm, what do we think's going to win this, Best Film of the Decade? Toy Story 3. Erm, Toy Story 3, audience? MANY: Yes. Anyone for Wolf Of Wall Street? Yeah. Four people, all of whom, by the way, are doing lines of coke as we speak. Let's find out, shall we? What is the Best Film of the Decade? Is it Wolf Of Wall Street or is it Toy Story 3? It's a landslide. It's a landslide for Toy Story 3. APPLAUSE There we have it. Listen, we've had four categories, we've got four winners. We have one more job to do, though. We know what our winners are. Sherlock won the Best Film, Best Song was Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, Best New Thing was emojis, and Best Film was Toy Story 3. What is the Best Thing of the Decade? If you had to choose, Alex, out of those? Emojis. Emojis, the Best Thing of the entire Decade. It's been a tough ten years. Rhianna, if you had to choose one of these four? As a film critic, I can't not say Toy Story 3, of course. Toy Story 3. Lorraine? If it's not Deadpool, it's gotta be Toy Story 3. Er. Jon? LAUGHTER And audience, we need you to choose The Best Thing of the whole Decade from those four winners, please. I'm gonna give you ten seconds to vote. Your time starts now. Isn't it nice, by the way, to have a vote where you actually want one of them to win? It makes a change, doesn't it? OK, then, what is the Best Thing of the Decade? In fourth place it is? Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson. Isn't it awful to be the Best Song of the Decade and then go, "Oh, I'm last. I came last!" 11%. Not as good as emojis. Erm, in third place? Oh. On 22! Can I say something? If you fuckers have voted emojis, I mean, come on. LAUGHTER Erm, let's find out what is the Greatest Thing of the Decade. Is it emojis, is it Toy Story 3? The Greatest Thing of the Decade is? Oh. Toy Story 3! APPLAUSE Beautiful. Well done. Well done, audience. That's nice. The Greatest Thing of the Decade is officially Toy Story 3. Audience, you did beautifully. Thank you so much, Congratulations to Toy Story 3. Here's a... This is a beautiful little scene. Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind, and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you, ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what. You think you can take care of him for me? OK, then. GIGGLES Ah, beautiful. APPLAUSE Beautiful. Alex, Rhianna, Lorraine, Jon, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much at home, thank you to everybody who voted, as well, on Twitter for all these wonderful World Cups of the Decade. Been an absolute pleasure. And we'll see you all again in ten years' time. APPLAUSE Subtitles by Red Bee Media
