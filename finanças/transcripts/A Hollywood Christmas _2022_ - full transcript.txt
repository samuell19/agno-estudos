Hmm. Hmm! I think I outdid myself with this one. Thank you for agreeing with me. Oh. Hi, there! Welcome to Chloe's Cakes! - What can I get you fellas? - I'm looking for the owner, Ms. Chloe Donner. Well, that is me. - Hello, my name is Jeb. - Hi, Jeb. I'm Chloe. - I work in the city for Landmark Real Estate. - Mmm-hmm. You have 30 days to vacate these premises. No. No. That can't be right. You're evicting me at Christmas? This building is being repurposed to maximize financial positions. Look, it's nothing personal, it's just... - Seriously? - I'm sorry. That's okay, I will just take it back. Yeah. No, that can't be right. You're evicting me at... - I'm Sorry! - Oh, dude! What? Oh, my God. Okay, let's cut! That's a cut. What is this guy, allergic to Christmas? I need a block. Want me to handle it? No, I got it. All right, everybody, take five! Hey, are you all right? I'm sorry. I'm allergic to dogs. Daniel? It is specifically noted in the casting call: no dog allergies. I really needed this job. - All right. Can we get you an allergy pill or something? - I took two already. Okay, take a break. And... Bless you. Get a snack at the craft services table. And we'll use you later. I'm so sorry. Thank you. - Um, Jessica? - Yes. - I have a quick question. - Sure. When Zooey barks, how do I know what she's saying? You don't actually. Okay, so, I don't speak dog language? It's more like Zooey reflects your inner feelings back to you. Mmm. Mmm-hmm. So, she's a psychic dog? Um... Yeah. She is a little bit psychic. - That's wild. - Right? Okay, cool. Okay, let's try this again. Wow. Back to one, everyone! Wait. Jeb needs three lawyers with him. - It'll work with two. - It needs to be three. - Sorry. - Okay. You! Go outside! You! Come fill in here. - Me? - Yes, come on. - Let's go. - You want me to... What? - What's your name? - I'm Christopher. Christopher, are you allergic to dogs? -No. -Great. You're in the scene now. - Come on. - Okay. I'll hold these. Let's get you in there. So, you follow those guys, Christopher. You are one of the lawyers now. - Yeah. - Yeah. I always thought I'd be a good lawyer. Let's put a pin in that, and just... break a leg. Costumes, can we have the jacket flown in for our new lawyer, please. Let's make this happen, people. Thank you. Oh, no, don't do that... Yeah, just blend into the background, yeah. Okay, new guy. Yeah, okay, over here. So, this is how it's gonna work. He's gonna open the door. You're going to file in fourth, and you're going to land back left. - Cool. - You clear? - Yeah. - All right. Let's go. Clear the set. Everyone in first positions. Ready, Jess? Call it, Daniel. Roll sound! Roll camera! Rolling. Scene three. Take two. Mark. Action. Reena? - Right here. - How many singers do we have for the caroling scene? I asked Daniel for 12 like you said, so we got six. Perfect. I sent you my notes on the bakery logo, Cooper. I got them. Uh, making the changes. Excuse me, Jessica? Lawyer guy. Christopher, right? Did you not get your chips back? I grabbed another bag. Great. Well, thanks for jumping in there. The second AD can sign you out. Oh. I'm not an extra. Well, you weren't the lead. No, I just started working with the network. I came by the set today to introduce myself. Oh. I'm sorry, I... Why didn't you tell me sooner? What? And miss out on my big break? Sorry. Uh, it's just, you know, the suit, kind of, threw me. But it's really nice to meet you. You too. Oh, and I'm supposed to tell you we're shutting down the Christmas Movie division. That is a funny joke, Christopher. You do make a good lawyer. I'm afraid it's not a joke. What? Uh... Does Kelly know about this? She's no longer with the company. -What about Steven? -He's moved on, also. Theresa is in charge now. -Who's Theresa? -It's a whole new team. Massive shake-up. Geez. You guys should really think about putting out a newsletter or something. The market is dominated by the two "Christmas channels." It's not a financial win for us to compete, so we're trying a whole new direction for programming. - Which is? - Thrillers, mostly. Women in peril, ripped-from-the-headlines, that kind of thing. So, you want the cupcake girl to be abducted by terrorists? That's actually a really good idea. - I have a contract for three more Christmas movies. - Not with the new team. Everyone loves Christmas movies. Do they? Aren't they all a little predictable? That's a feature, not a bug. That's the whole point of Christmas movies. Tell him, Reena. Big city boy meets small town girl, they have conflict. Small town charm wins out over the cruel unfeeling corporate world. The lovers use Christmas magic to save the day and fall hopelessly in love. Oh, and, if he's secretly a prince, it's a double whammy. Aren't you bored just talking about it? It's not boring, it's comforting. It's curling up with a cup of hot cocoa or snuggling in front of a fire on a snowy night. - Are those things boring to you? - Those things are simple. That's why they're comforting. Our movies need to be complex. They need to have layers. They need to surprise the audience. This is my brand, Christopher. I'm good at this. Do you know how hard it is for a female director to build a reputation in this town? I'm gonna finish this movie on my terms, because apparently after this, I'm out of a job, because some suits don't believe in Christmas magic. Christmas magic is like snow in LA. There's no such thing. Okay. Thank you for the heads up. We can talk more about it tomorrow if you want. - What's tomorrow? - It's day two, right? I'm going to be on set for all of production. That's not necessary. The network wanted me to keep a close eye on the budget spend. I guess some of their recent movies went way over. I'm from finance. Numbers are kinda my thing. Well, making movies is kinda my thing. But you can't make movies without money. - Come on, we can work together. - Super. - Have you worked on a lot of movies? - This is my first. - Lucky me. - Oh, wait. If I had some ideas about the script? Do I talk to you about those, or... Let's just put a pin in that. Where are you headed? Oh, I'm that grey little number out... Uff. Excuse me. You okay? Okay, that my life just got turned upside-down? No. I need a moment. It's gonna work out. Why are you smiling? - This is a Christmas movie. - Yeah, that nobody cares about. Not the movie, this. This whole thing is a Christmas movie. What are you talking about? You're the lead, like Chloe, trying to do this special Christmas thing, and Christopher is Jeb, the big city hotshot, trying to shut you down. - I'm a big city hotshot, too. - Not in this case. You're the small town girl who knows what makes Christmas special. I know how to make Christmas movies special. Same thing. Well, big city hotshots who don't know what they're talking about are not limited to Christmas. - There's me too. - You? Your plucky, young sidekick trying to talk sense into you. Classic Christmas movie character. Can I trade you in for a talking dog? Not according to my contract. You're missing one thing. - What's that? - It's July. You can't always contain Christmas magic to December. Hey. Which way to set? - Up on the left. - Thanks. So, now we have to make sure this movie comes out perfect. So, I can get the network to reconsider Christmas movies. Shouldn't be a problem. Did you say there's a problem? Oh, good. You're here. No. There's no problem. We have a problem. Ashley? - She doesn't wanna come to set. - Of course, she won't. - I'll go talk to her. - Yep. Yeah, we should go talk to her. So, how do you wanna play this? Good cop, bad cop? No, I can handle this. Hey, Ashley, hon? You okay? Did you see what Michael posted on Instagram? I did not. My co-star hates working with me. Do you know how many followers he has? - That's not nice. - No, it's not, and he's a jerk. You know, I think he was probably just trying to be funny and generate some likes. At my expense? I don't think so. -Just give her some time. She'll come around. -There is no time. Every day is precisely planned out from start to finish. Every 15 minutes that goes by is a shot lost from the movie. Can't you just replace her? What are you talking about? Hey, if your portfolio has a dud, you sell it, buy something new, stay on top of the market. We would lose the entire day, and we have to re-shoot everything from yesterday. Besides, I don't think she's a dud. - I think she's quite talented. - Hmm. Okay. Do you mind if I? Thanks. Hey, Ashley. It's Christopher. I'm the network executive on the movie. Yeah? You know it's so great to meet you. I loved your part on Euphoria. - You saw that? - My college roommate actually wrote the episode. - He was lucky to have you. - Really? Look, between you and me, you can act circles around Michael. I can see why he's so jealous. - Do you think he is? - It's kind of obvious, isn't it? Don't let a fragile male ego rob you of another incredible performance. You got this. Oh, my God. You're so right. Wow, it is so good to connect with you. Pleasure's all mine. Okay. Um. I'm pretty good at this, huh? Oh, yeah, flattering an actress. You really cracked the code. Mmm-hmm. He's your antagonist, but he's got a helpful side. - Checks that box. - Not now, Reena. I'll be in the trailer if you need me. Okay, everyone let's get ready to shoot this. Okay, we're second away, people. Just waiting on lighting. Where's the dog? He should be in the scene. He's cute. He's a she. And she's expensive to have around. So, we use her sparingly. Oh, yeah, if she's expensive, we should use her less. Save the money. You know, this was all planned out before you and Theresa came around, right? Right, right. - Okay, stop. That's so hard. - Okay. Ready, Jess. Okay, everyone, let's make some Christmas magic. Quiet on set. - Roll sound. - Speedy. - Roll camera. - Rolling. Is this one for me? Scene 13. Take one. Mark. Okay, action. Coffee's here. Thanks. Will you help me over here? Sure. What can I do? You know, I'm really starting to like this town. Oh, good. You're here. - Is something wrong, Chloe? - Oh, Jeb. They're just not decorating the tree the way that they used to, and... The old way was perfect. - I think it looks very nice. - Well, what do you know? Well, I know the bakery isn't making enough dough. Get it? It's bakery... Dough. You're closing me down and now you're making jokes? - Yeah, I'm sorry, I... - It's not funny, because that place is everything to me. - Yeah, I shouldn't have... - You think you are so much better than me. And that just because you're a man, you can trash my reputation? - Because I'm a man? - I see you. I see you. And I know what you're doing, so just back off! -Yo, Jess. Are there new pages or...? -Cut! That's a cut. Background, back to one... This is so hot. Can you just take this, please? Okay, okay, go, go. - Oh! I was just trying something new. - I saw. Okay, um, are we allowed to improvise or? I'd prefer not. Oh, but I was really feeling that. - I totally saw that. - Yeah. But, you know, I just think it's a little strong for where Chole is at this point in the story. Mmm-mmm. No, no. Chloe needs to stand up to Jeb. - Okay, my question is, are we doing the scene... - We're doing the scene. Yes. - As written. Okay? - Yeah. That would be great. Michael? Can you give us a moment? Female time... Yeah. Sure. I really like what you're doing. Okay. Thank you. Nice! But remember, Chloe doesn't overpower Jeb by arguing with him. - No? - No, no. Chloe just has to stay true to what she believes in. - Mmm. - That's what inspires Jeb to have a change of heart. - I think I get it, yeah. - And, between you and me, Christopher was right. You are acting circles around him. I get it! - Let's try it again, yeah? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Wardrobe. Last looks. - Why don't you just go talk to him? - This is better. Trust me. How long do we give him? As long as it, and he's doing such amazing work. Oh, hey. I was just talking about you. - Can I walk with you? - Sure. So, I really love the tension between your character, Jeb, and Chloe. - I can really feel it. - Yeah, it gets pretty intense sometimes. - So I wonder if I can maybe harness your superpowers here. - Mine? - Yeah, you have such a natural charm and magnetism. - Right? I wonder if you could get a little more friendly with Ashley, off set. Maybe you can, I don't know, bring another aspect to her performance. Just make her feel like you really see her, you know. - I think that will help us in the later scenes. - For you, anything. - Thank you, Michael. - I got it, Jess. Can I give you these? Absolutely. Come in. Hey, there you are. You kinda snuck out on me back there. - Did I? - You know, I have learned so much. I'm so glad. Um... Do you wanna join me for dinner? I would love to pick your brain, get to know you and this movie stuff better. I have a lot to prepare for tomorrow. - But you gotta eat. - Well, I have a bar. - Like, with scotch? - No, a protein bar. Oh, well, that's not dinner. It is, tonight. - It's Reena, right? - I'm not here. Reena, what would you say is Jessica's biggest flaw? I would say she doesn't have any. That's a good answer. But, really. What would bring her to the next level? I think she's doing great work. Yeah, her Christmas movie work, sure. But... What's holding her back? Well, now I'm kinda curious myself. Her perfectionism gets in her way. - Boom. - My what? - I'm sorry. - No, don't be sorry. - I think we're on to something here. I think... - You know... Let's go get that dinner. Great. Awesome. - I will meet you on the soundstage in ten. - And then? And then, I'll take care of the rest. - My perfectionism gets in the way? - That's all I could think of. Why not just tell him I still wet my bed? It would be less embarrassing. You still wet the bed? No, Reena. Right. Now I have to get dinner with him. Right on schedule. I'm sorry? For the Christmas story of all this. You two get to know each other. You see a side of him you hadn't before. He finds a new appreciation for what you do. What if I murder him at dinner? Is that part of your Christmas movie? Then you'd be making one of the network's thrillers. That I could probably live with. Christopher? Yeah. I'm right back here. Honestly, I did have to put out a few fires. It's good I got here. We did lose a shot. No, we'll work it out. Oh, hey, Jessica's here. Yes. Yes, of course. Okay. Oh, say hi to Theresa. - Hi, Theresa. - Did you hear her? Theresa says "hi." - Great. - Okay. Okay, bye. We got the whole place to ourselves. I didn't know this set had a working kitchen. No, one of our other movies was serving dinner, and, wait, no, they... They went into second meal. That's a thing, right? - Yes. - Yes. - So, I grabbed these. - Fancy. Not bad. Thank you. So, Ashley seems to be doing better. She killed it today. Maybe Michael is the problem. Don't worry about Ashley and Michael any more. Why not? It's the formula. Boy meets girl. They have conflict. Christmas magic brings them together, makes them fall hopelessly in love. Trust the formula. Oh. Oh, I got 'em. Thank you. - Hey, I liked your ad lib today. - Yeah. It got kind of hot. - Yeah, it definitely got intense. - Yes. - What are you, like, a Leo? - Aries. I knew it. You're total fire sign. - What are you? - I'm a Libra. -Okay, that makes sense. We're complete opposites. -We're complimentary! - We're polarizing! - We provide balance for each other! - Oh. - Yeah. It's, kind of, cold. - Here you go. Nice and warm. - Thank you. Did you see my Insta post? - Yeah, yeah, I did! - It was so funny, right? Yes, it was so funny. - I know. - Yes. Hey, do you wanna take a selfie with me? Oh, yeah. Yes. What's your good side? - This one. - I was gonna say that one. Really? Oh, thank you. Oh, my gosh, okay. - Let's break the Internet. - Oh, please. - Rawr. - Be a cat. So, when you say you come from finance, what is that exactly? Uh, mergers and acquisitions. Venture capital. And who it is you do that for? Wherever my skills have taken me. Wall Street, a couple of start-ups, a hedge fund out of Kansas City. From hedge funds to Hollywood? - That's a leap. - Not really. Movies are crazy expensive. To be honest, I don't really know where all the money goes. We do have a budget. Yeah, I was looking at that. It is very complex. I mean, there's so many line items, but, I'll figure it out. But what made you choose movies as your next job? Oh, I went to the same prep school as Carl. You know Carl? Lomax? - The CEO of our network? - Yeah, he's a great guy. He thought I'd be a good fit for the new team. - So now you just suddenly work at a major network? - Yeah. What Ivy League school did you go to? - What makes you think I... - Which one? - Princeton. - Couldn't get into Harvard? I did. I chose Princeton. Yeah, okay. You don't live in the same world as us regular folk. The world just rises up and gifts you a place in it. For the rest of us, we have to carve out a place. We have to plant our flag and defend our land. And your land is Cupcake Christmas? My land is... warm, comforting, predictable entertainment. Why did you pick Christmas movies? This lady. We always spent Christmas at my Grandma Pearl's. And every year, she and I would snuggle up on the couch. And binge watch Christmas movies together. I'm sure I've seen at least a hundred of them in my life. It's what made me want to get into filmmaking. Wait. Not The Godfather? Or Citizen Kane? -Oh, no. Too complex. Too many layers. -Ah. I do this because I chose it. Not just because it was my next stop on "wherever my skills will take me." I binged watched all of your six Christmas movies. Starting with the first: Perfectly Christmas. Yep. That movie put me on the Christmas map. Wow. We basically had no money. I made so many mistakes. But people loved it. They did. How are we supposed to be able to quantify that? It's not an equation, Princeton. It's an art form. Ooh. That was deep. For you. Where did you guys eat? In an airplane? And, how did it go? It was good. Fine. So that's all you're going to say? Did you guys hit it off? Well, we're very different people. - How so? - Well, for one thing, he's a Princeton grad. - A what? - A Princeton... - A what? - A Prince... A Prince? - ton grad. - Big city hotshot is secretly a Prince? It's a Christmas movie double whammy! That is a stretch. You can't write this stuff! Eventually, someone will. Reena, can we get back to work, please? Let's go a little lighter. Do you wanna do a 24 or 35? - Thirty-five. - Okay, I'm on it. Let's get the dog in. We have a problem. So, she was in there with you... I put her wardrobe on, you know, like I usually do. She was definitely fussy. I was getting these vibes from her, like, I've never gotten before, you know. - Maybe it was the vegan kibble I gave her... - And then? Well, and then, I went to grab her treats for the next scene, and I turned around, and she was gone. - She was gone! - Okay, well, she can't get off the lot, so... Wait. You think she got off the lot? No, no, no. No one's going to let a dog dressed like an elf off a studio lot. - We need to start shooting, Jessica. - We gotta find Zooey first. - Yes, we have to find Zooey. - Yes. Zooey! Zooey, come to me! It's a dog dressed like an elf, people. Shouldn't be too hard to spot. Everyone, fan out and keep your walkies on Channel one. This shouldn't take too long. I hope not. Let's do it. Let's go check with other productions. Oh, good idea. Yes? No? Okay, thank you. Uh, well... But if you do see her, this is my cell. Okay. Do you think maybe you're a jinx? In what way? Well, everything that can go wrong on this movie is going wrong, and you're always around for it. Hmm. That's interesting. Or, these things are going to go wrong anyway, and it's great that I'm here for it. Think about that. Hey, excuse me. Have you... seen a dog? I'm sorry, no. This isn't gonna work. Wait, wait, wait. Grease meets The Walking Dead? Are you kidding me? Why didn't I think of that? Oh, I've an idea. - Well? - Okay. - This is a dog call my dad used to use on his fox hunts. - Oh, stop. Let me try it. It might work. I guess Zooey isn't a descendent of British royalty. Maybe I didn't do it right. Hold on. Let's try this. We can spread it far and wide. Hit it, Prince Harry. Sorry, your highness. It wasn't a terrible idea. We got the dog! Okay, everyone, back to set. I think a thank you is in order. Why? The walkie was my idea. Yeah, but the whistle was mine. It wouldn't have worked without the whistle. Yeah, well. The whistle wouldn't have worked without the walkie... - I drink away too much coffee. - You look really good. - Oh, my goodness. - Look at your little hat. All right, everyone. Let's get ready to shoot. - Do we look cute together? - You do. You guys all set? - Yo, Jess, can you take a photo of us, please, real quick? - -Please. - You're killing me. - Here. Hey, when my four million followers watch this movie, you're gonna thank me. - You're gonna thank him. - I got it. You go. Hey. Okay. Count to three. One... She's blocking my face. Hang on. She's blocking my face. All right. Okay. One, two, three. - You guys look so beautiful. - Oh, yeah. -Okay. -All right, everyone. Quiet on set. Say, "That's my Mommy and Daddy." How'd you know that dog whistle thing? I didn't. Christopher did. - Mmm-hmm. Team work... - Don't. I will be in the trailer if you need me. - I'm sorry. - Sorry. Wow. - Making movies is exciting. - If you mean stressful, then, yes, I agree. You know, it's really neat the way everyone got on board to help. It's their job. Okay, everyone, quiet on set. It's nothing like the world that I come from. This is cool. Time to work. Let's lock it up. Roll sound! - Roll camera! - Rolling... - Scene 28. - Take one. Mark. And... action. Sprinkles, or no sprinkles? That's what I was thinking. And let's remember to check on the band for the Christmas Celebration scene. On it. Hey, Jess. Can I give you a lift to your trailer? No, it's right over there. Come on. Hop in. Time for a sleigh ride. Check. Where to, milord? Once around ye olde studio lot, my lad. Giddy up! What have you done? I am embracing the Christmas movie. Just had to deck out the transport. This is a lovely golf-cart sleigh, Christopher, but this is not what makes a Christmas movie. - Why not? - Because all the things in Christmas movies, the sleigh rides, the caroling, the tree lighting, it's just the window dressing. If that's all it took, then Die Hard would be a Christmas movie. That is literally the best Christmas movie. Okay, well, the heart of my Christmas movies is the love story. It's finding true love through the magic of the Christmas season. You're saying I spent all this money on holly for nothing? It's not holly. It's mistletoe. Maybe I should have done a little more research. Whoa! I can walk from here. Wait, I have an idea for Chloe's Cupcakes. Okay. Okay, so, right now, the bakery gets saved because love is the main ingredient in the cupcakes. -Did I read that right? -You did. It's part of the magic. Okay, well, I was just thinking, what if, to save the bakery, Chloe does something more active? - Like what? - Like she creates something new, and then it gets more attention for the bakery. It just feels a little outside of the formula. Oh, okay. Uh... Will you think about it? Yeah, I will. And thanks for the sleigh ride. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Yippee-ki-ay! Did you get my script changes? Yep, props will have them ready for this afternoon. Not a problem. Okay, great. - We've got a problem. - What is it? - Someone changed the cupcakes from the bakery scene. - I did that. You shouldn't mess with the Christmas formula. It was a note from the network. Have you seen Christopher? He's not here. Do you want me to get a hold of him? No. I can text him. Let's do it, Daniel. - Picture's up. - Picture's up. Background, to first positions. Okay, everyone, quiet on set. Let's get ready to shoot. Roll sound. Roll camera. Rolling. Scene 31. Take one. Mark. And... action. Yeah, the tree looks great. Um. Yeah, it does. You were right about the ornament. Just because something is different doesn't mean it's bad. And what did you hang there? That's my mom. She started Chloe's Cakes 20 years ago. And now I'm shutting it down. Yeah. What if you create something new to get your bakery more attention? Hadn't really thought about that. Yeah... I wonder if, um, I helped out, we could think of something together. You'd help me save my bakery? I feel like I would... do almost anything to help you out, Ms. Donner. There you are! I've been looking all over this crappy little town for you! Nadia, what are you doing here? What? I can't surprise my fiancé as an early Christmas present? Fiancé? Uh... Yeah. Uh, sorry. Do you want us to cut, or... Are we, like, walking? What are you... Oh, cut. Yeah, cut! That's a cut! Cutting. - You okay? - Yeah. - That was so awkward. - Yeah. You guys can stop hugging now. - Uh... Is everything okay? - Yeah. Hey, yeah, you guys are killing it. Um, it's just a... You know, it's just the lighting issue we're trying to work out. But you keep doing what you're doing. - That's good, right? - Yeah, really good. Jess, Jess, Jess. Uh, so I just have a quick question. When I hang the ornament on the tree, do you want me to cry a little? Do you want to cry a little? I can cry a little. I can do it whenever I want, I can cry on command. -Well, let's try it. It could be nice. -Okay. Okay. - Okay, everyone, let's reset. - Yeah - Let's try it again. - What is she doing? - You okay? - Yeah. All right, back to one, everyone. Roll sound. Roll camera. Rolling. Are you going to lunch or do you want me to grab you something? Still no word from Christopher. Sorry. Hey, Jessica. There's someone here to see you. She's over on the office set. The office set? I'll just take this out of your way. It's gotta be dry by now. - Jessica, hi. - Yes. - I'm Theresa Frost. - I'm the New Network president. - Great to finally meet you. - You too. We're really getting a lot of attention from you guys lately. Yes, we've been in such a twister with this whole Christmas movie thing. Well... This thing? We're going to dial back your budget to completion. In the middle of production? Oh, you have no idea the over-spending that we inherited. We're tightening the belt across the board. Wow. Okay. - Does Christopher know about this? - Um, it was his idea. So, clearly. I'm sure he told you that we're shutting down the whole Christmas Movie division. Oh... He did. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's just... so much better content available out there. Right? I mean, no offense. You know what I mean. Anyway, I will leave you to it. It was so nice to meet you though. - So vibrant. - Thanks. Christopher knew about this? Something's not right. Theresa shouldn't be cutting your budget. She should be the girlfriend that's wrong for Christopher. I'm texting Christopher. This is because you changed the script! It's spilling over into your story line. I don't have a story line, Reena! This is my life, and it's falling apart! I got it. You better have a real good explanation for this. What did he say? I'm not dealing with this right now. Ugh. Is this how he's climbed the corporate ladder? He has a girlfriend. Did you know he had a girlfriend? - No, I just found out she is his wife. - No! He said girlfriend. - Christopher told you he has a girlfriend? - Who is Christopher? - Who are you talking about? - Stupid sexy Michael! - Michael has a girlfriend? - Yes! And that's made you this mad because... You slept together? Yeah. You told me to make her feel like I see her. - By complimenting her. - I did. Well, it worked too well! I feel like it kind of worked just the right amount. She said you have a girlfriend. Yeah, I do, but she's an actor, too. And, she and I have this deal that sho-mances don't count as cheating. So, your girlfriend is fine with it? Yeah, it was her idea! Okay. Well... Did you ever think that Ashley might not be fine with being a sho-mance? I mean, we didn't discuss it. Well, you might have a girl who's falling for you here. Hmm. Oh, boy. Michael, listen to me, uh... You can't play games with people's hearts. And you can't predict when and where someone might find a true love story. Even on a movie set, it happens. Okay, I'll talk to her. Thank you. Daniel. Sorry... It just helps me relax. Have you seen the new budget numbers? I've heard some things. Mmm-hmm. What? We're gonna have to make some cuts... No. I'm not compromising one frame. I need to talk to Christopher. - Okay, but we should start thinking... - I will handle this. - We should start thinking about it now. - I will handle this! What the... Did Zooey come by here? - That way. - Oh! Do you need some help? No, I got her! - Jess. - Yeah. Christopher has been looking for you. - And...? - And he's here. In our trailer. What just happened to me? I'm so sorry. Was this the plan all along? Just pretend you care and then pull the rug out from under us? I do care. Is that why you suggested cutting our budget? - Is that what Theresa said? - Yes. Did she also say that they were gonna stop production all together? Jessica, today I was told to shut you down. Shut us down? It's my fault. I didn't understand some of the finishing cost in the budget, I didn't realize we needed that much money for the completion of the film. You're supposed to be the numbers guy. I know, I know. And I'm so sorry. But when Theresa saw the correct amount, she freaked. I had to convince her we could still finish but... with what we have left. It can't get finished for less, Christopher! Our budget was perfect! Well, now you have a new budget. So... Okay. So what? It's either this or nothing? Okay, everybody, we're back from lunch. I'm gonna finish my damn movie. Excuse me. Hey... Daniel, did we change the cupcakes to keto cupcakes? Loading them up now. It's not too late to change them back to cupcakes made with love. Just get everyone ready to shoot. Pictures up. Whitney, keto cupcakes? Seconds away. Keto cupcakes. I like it. - Was that the surprise you texted me about? - Get out. -What? -Go on. This is now a closed set. Reena? Yes? Can you please escort our network executive off of the set? Me? We are on a very tight budget and I can't afford any distractions. Fine. I'll go. I'm just relieved that this is still happening. Clock's ticking. Good luck. We say "break a leg" in this business. Daniel, is the dog here yet? Flying in. Big gesture. What's that? That's how you get her past this. - I do? - Yes. Big city hotshot screws up, but then makes a big gesture because he has come to appreciate what the small town girl believes in. I tried. What else am I supposed to do? You'll figure it out. We're here! We're here! Zooey's here! I got her! She's fine! She's absolutely fine! She is fine! Zooey flying in. Excuse me. I think that's everyone. Do you want to roll sound on this? Not on this. It's for the montage. Okay, sound stand down. Everyone else, let's do this. Quiet on set. Roll camera. - Rolling. - Stop the MOS. And... action. Okay, cut! All of this and rain? We made it to the last day. What time tomorrow? 1:00 p.m. crew call. How many townspeople do we have? None. What? I told you we're gonna have to make cuts along the way, and you didn't want to, so now we have no money for extras. A town-wide celebration with no townspeople? We have a Santa. - How many kids to meet Santa? - Oh, God, no. - You know how much onset teachers cost. - How about a band? - No. - A singer? No, nothing. Christmas Celebration has to be big and magical. It's where the lovers kiss for the first time! It's Christopher. He says he has an idea for the Christmas Celebration. - Oh, that's a good timing. - Call him. - No, we don't need him. - It wouldn't hurt to talk to him. - He's still around. - What? Where? Oh, boy. - Hi. - What are you doing here? You never said I couldn't be involved, just not on the set, so... Brett's been letting me watch the dailies. About the Christmas Celebration, I have some really... Don't you think you've caused enough problems? Hear me out. Uh, my nephew is in a summer theatre program at his high school. It is 15 kids. They could be in the movie for work-study credits. We don't even have to pay them. Fifteen high school kids? That's not a town-wide celebration, that's a tenth of a senior prom. We can throw big hats and coats on them. We need bodies, that's what matters most. We already had the perfect background actors. Well, now we don't. I also go to First Presbyterian Church, and they have a 25-member choir plus musical accompaniment. I made a deal with the pastor that they could be in the movie as part of a community outreach event, so, we don't have to pay them either. Amateur musicians, great. - What is going on with you? - We're just plugging holes. What other options do we have right now? Christopher, these are great ideas. Do you have time to draw up the paperwork with me? Only if it's okay with Jessica. Everything doesn't have to be perfect. Fine. Okay, good. Let's just spend the final day herding cats. Make it happen. Well, that was it. This is our last day. The bakery is officially closed. The Christmas Celebration? I'm not really in the mood for celebrating. I don't care that Jeb's going to be there. I never want to see his face ever again. Christmas is ruined. Okay, cut! - That was good. - That was great. - Good shot. - Good? We got it. Moving on. All right, that's lunch everyone. Next scene is at the Town Square for the Christmas Celebration. I don't ever wanna see your face again. - Look, I just wanna show you something. - What? - Look. - Oh, God. -What filter is that? Clarendon? -Yeah. - Could you be any more basic? - Hey, look at the likes. Notice anything different? I have 400,000 new followers. I have 400,000 new followers. She's got 400,000 new followers. - Okay, uh... - We broke the Internet. Let's go take photos wearing each other's wardrobe. - It's brilliant. - Let's go. I'm obsessed. Well, thank you for letting us know. We have a problem. The paperwork didn't go through for the church to be able to participate as community outreach. So, now we have... no choir or musical accompaniment. Oh, no. Um... Maybe the theatre kids will be enough. 15 teenagers representing an entire town? Well, we can, we can... We can reuse them. We can stack 'em, shoot 'em, move 'em around. So now we have to lose the musical part of the scene. I think so. This ruins everything. Daniel, I needed this. How can I get the network to reconsider Christmas movies if this one looks like a joke? I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault. It's... mine. I ruined Christmas. We can fix this. How? We need to follow the formula. - What formula? - Is Christopher here today? - He's in editing. - Get him. I'm sorry about the church extras. Forget that. This isn't about the Christmas movie right now. It's about Jessica. - Me? - Yes. You need to confront your character flaw. That's what needs to happen right now. - Wait. Like, in a Christmas movie? - Yes. Do you have a better idea? Then let's get to it. That's what I've been saying this whole time. You know what you need to say. So just say it. Okay. - So, you want me to say my perfectionism gets in my way? - Yep. - That's it. - I'm afraid so, yeah. Okay, then. So, let's unpack that. Where do you think that comes from? I don't know. Jessica, think. Haven't you ever been to therapy? It's always a tether to your childhood. What was it for you? Well... I guess my parents fought a lot. - I'm so sorry. - Shh. And I always just tried so hard to be perfect, you know. Like, just so I wouldn't give them another thing to fight about. But every year when we went to visit my Grandma Pearl at Christmas time, everyone would be on their best behavior. Cuddling up with Grandma Pearl and watching people fall in love at Christmas time. That was, um... That was my safe space. That's the feeling that I always wanted to create with my movies, you know. To give everyone else that feeling. And... if I can't get it perfect, I just... feel like I'm just letting everyone down. So... There it is. You can't make a perfect movie, Jessica. I bet all those movies the two of you watched together weren't perfect either. No, not by a long shot. Um... Neither was my movie, Perfectly Christmas. And people loved it anyway, because... Because it had heart. It's not an equation. It's an art form. It's an art form where all these people get to come together and contribute to make this one special thing. And that is what's on the screen. It's the love. You guys are right. Everything does not have to be perfect. Okay, boom. There it is. We have addressed your character flaw. Now the final resolution to the main conflict can present itself. Can present itself. Santa! Ho, ho, ho! Where are all the children? I heard there was a Christmas Celebration happening here. Yes, I am sorry. I can get you signed in, Santa. Santa doesn't sign in. Santa comes down the chimney! Okay. Were you able to find parking all right? Oh, no trouble at all. I've got the reindeer up on the roof. Of course. Just what we need, a method Santa. Where are my elves? - I can lead you to your trailer. - Okay. Music! There must be music! I can play you music on my guitar, Santa. Oh! - Daniel, wait! - Yeah? Can you play Christmas songs on your guitar? I can play the chords to just about anything. It won't be perfect, though. Doesn't matter. Does anyone else on the crew play an instrument? The editor does. How do you know that? I spent a lot of time with him in there. He's a little weird. Well, maybe we can put together a band after all. Let's ask everyone on the crew if they play an instrument. If they do, they're in the band, if they don't, then we'll use them as townsfolk for the celebration. We'll still need a singer. You got it. Just follow me this way, sir. All hands-on deck, and maybe with the help of a little Christmas magic... Love can save Christmas! Hey, fellas, bring it in. Bring it in. Over here. Let's go. Quick little team meeting. Guys, I need your help. Hey, Brett. Any chance you got your violin? Who wants to be on camera for once? I have an idea for you. Who wants to be in a movie? Look at that. Oh, that's good... - Chloe. - What do you want? I have something to show you. Your bakery doesn't have to close. You two seem good. - Yeah, we're great. - Yeah, we're really good. - We're so good. - So, his girlfriend actually met someone on the movie that she's doing and dumped him. - So, it's like perfect timing. - Perfect timing. I love you. - You're so hot. - You're so... hot. Shut your beautiful lips. Stop. Okay, Christmas miracles everywhere. Daniel. Did you call our Santa to set? I did, 20 minutes ago. He's not in his trailer. But Christopher's out looking for him now. Okay... Well... Hey, Daniel! Coming! The dog pooped on set. Did the dog poop on set? Bob, don't... Bob! - We have a problem. - Yeah, we do. Theresa! Hi! Uh, what brings you to set? Christopher insisted that I come see this... - Christmas Celebration shoot. - Oh. He did? That's, that's... That's great. Okay, but when is it gonna start? 'Cause I haven't got all night. We're just about ready to shoot. Shouldn't be too long. What... What in the world is that supposed to be? We couldn't afford to have any actual children in the scene... for tonight. - It looks ridiculous. - We'll make it work. Will you? It's gonna look great, once the lights come on and... - our lenses. - And Santa? What about Santa? He is on his way. Little reindeer here about this big? Yeah, like this big, and I also wanted you to name it Lima. - What are you doing? - Oh! These wonderful children just needed a little Christmas magic. They're ready to shoot. I have to get you to set. No, no, no, I need a few more minutes with these delightful youngsters. Hi. We don't have a few more minutes! Every 15 minutes that ticks by is another shot lost from the movie. Santa, you're coming with me. We're just waiting for the sun to go down a little bit more... Yeah. - For the shot. - Mmm. -It just needs to be... just right. -Right. I wonder maybe if this is why our movies go over budget. On Dasher! I just read this article. This woman whose husband locked her in the basement for six months. That... would make a great movie. Hello! Careful now. Hey! Well, I think I've seen enough. Have Christopher give me a call. He and I have a lot to discuss. Mmm-hmm. All right, we're here! - I've got Santa! - Ho, ho, ho. - Theresa, hi. - Ho, ho, ho. Now this is a celebration! Oh, hello. Have you been a naughty girl this year? - Daniel! - Yes. -No, no, no. Santa, how are you? -Hey. - It's nice to have you back on set. - Okay. Let me escort you to your throne. Um, I am leaving. No, no, you can't go. You gotta stay for the Christmas Celebration. I think I've seen what I need to see. Come on, everybody on this movie has worked so hard to make this special. Special? There's crew members in the movie. There's sandbags dressed up as children. At least I know now that I made the right decision shutting all of this down. What a Grinch. Grinch. Her heart is two sizes too small. Ms. Frost... Wait! - You can't go. - Why not? By any chance, is there something that happened to you to make you hate Christmas? What? Don't be ridiculous. Nothing from when you were a little girl? Did you enjoy Christmas when you were young? Yeah, I enjoyed it enough. But... there is something. Ugh... Well, I was finally going to be the lead in our Christmas pageant. Yeah? And then, the choir director's daughter transferred into our school and she got to do it. And you... Oh, there weren't any other parts left for me to play, so, I sat in the audience and watched her sing the final song, and, get all the attention. Theresa. You were meant to be our singer. - For what? - For our Christmas Celebration. - Oh... - You were born to play this part. Oh, no. No, I'm not a performer. You were and it was taken away from you. But I can give it back to you. Me? Singing in a Christmas musical? I got you. I believe in you. - Just take some breaths. - Oh... And tonight, you get to share your gifts with the entire world, at last. I would really like that. I mean... - I guess. - Let's do this. Okay. Okay. Call it, Daniel. All right, party people. It's celebration time. Roll sound. Roll camera. Scene 68. Take one. Mark. And... action. Mmm. - Chloe. Hey, Chloe. - What do you want? - I have to show you something. - What? Your bakery doesn't have to close! Why not? Our parent company also owns Landmark Foods. I brought your cupcakes to them and they were a huge hit. - The keto cupcakes? - No, no. You were right all along. It was your original cupcakes. Well, yeah, that makes sense. They're made with love, and nothing is better than that. Look. This is a contract for Chloe's Cupcakes to be sold worldwide. "Chloe's Cupcakes will all be made and shipped from the original Chloe's Cakes kitchen that your mother founded." - Right here? - Right here. I don't want you to have to leave this beautiful town, and, I mean, frankly, I don't wanna leave either. Will you let me stay and help you? Wait. What about Nadia? I broke it off with her. I should have done it a long time ago. Okay, so, you want to stay here and help me sell cupcakes? Nothing would make me happier. Yeah, I think you're right. Oh, we are going to need a bigger kitchen. Welcome, everyone to the Christmas Celebration. This song goes out to all the Christmas lovers out there. The ones who love Christmas, - and the ones who find love at Christmas. - Aw! Oh the weather Outside is frightful But the fire Is so delightful And since we've No place to go Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! It doesn't show Signs of stopping And I've bought Some corn for popping The lights are turned Way down low Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! When we finally Kiss goodnight How I'll hate Going out in the storm! But if you'll really Hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dying And, my dear, We're still goodbying But as long as You love me so... Oh, Jeb. This is the best Christmas ever. - Cut! - That's a cut. Where's the snow? We can't have the kiss without the snow. I'm sorry, Jessica. I don't know what's wrong. Give me a minute. Sorry, guys. That was great. Just chill for a second while we get this situated. - Okay. - Uh... Let's go rehearse the kiss. Ooh. I thought that was going pretty well until the snow. We'll get it. I'm not worried. I wanted to tell you that I tried to convince Theresa that we needed your Christmas movies for our international streaming launch. I thought that going worldwide, like, Chloe's Cakes, would save the day. And did it? It did not. Because that's not how it works. What? Why not? You saw the scene. Logic doesn't save Christmas. Love saves Christmas. It always does. Well, love can save cupcakes, but maybe it can't save a movie deal. Oh, my! That was so exhilarating! - I loved it! - You were amazing! - I was okay? - Amazing. I was amazing? Oh, gosh, I just... I forgot the feeling, you know, that you get from Christmas movies. And that our network needs this. It... does? Nobody wants to watch women-in-peril at Christmas, right? We need these kinds of movies to hold onto our audience. I feel like I said something like that. I completely agree with you. I am going to honor your contract for three more Christmas movies. I am officially reopening the Christmas Movie division! As long as I can be in them. Just kidding. I mean, I might. Guess we'll find out. Wow. Love saved Christmas. Of course, it did. Jessica, do you remember when you were talking about planting your flag? Yeah. This is where I want to plant my flag. Right next to yours, if you'll let me. What about your career in finance? I am done with that. I want to be the guy who helps create this... this warm, comforting, safe place that the world gets to live in at Christmas time. Do you need a producer, maybe? I don't know. I mean... uh, a producer... You probably gonna have to be on set with me every day. Nothing would make me happier. Wait. Stop. What about your wife? My what? Your wife. Theresa. - Theresa? - Yes. Why are you calling her my wife? Because you did. - When? - In your text. Oh, stupid voice-to-text. It's keeps dropping words, not my... Not my real wife. My work wife. There it is. Classic romantic misunderstanding. How did I not figure that out? Right, guys? Miscommunication. That goes way back to, like, Shakespeare, and, He's Just Not That Into You. - Reena? - Yes. Can you give us a moment? In the trailer? No, just like, a step or two off to the side. I mean, okay... So... what do you think? I think... This is the best Christmas ever. I knew it. Well, look at that. Okay, save some snow for the movie. That's not me. Huh. Snow in LA. I guess you just can't contain Christmas magic.
