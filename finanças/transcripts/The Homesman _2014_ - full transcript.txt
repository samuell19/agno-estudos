Come on, girls. Whoa. Come on. Come on. - Hello, Bob. - Afternoon, Ms Cuddy. Come on inside. I got supper ready. The pie is made out of peaches from a can. Mmm-hmm. They had four of those cans. I don't know who got the other three. I don't know who could afford 'em. It's good pie. If it pleases you, we might have a postprandial recital. Do what? A bit of music. I like music. ♪ On the distant prairie, where the heather wild it In its quiet beauty lived and smiled ♪ Stands a little cottage, and a creeping vine it Loves around its porch to twine ♪ In that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child it With her blue eyes beaming soft and mild it And the wavy ringlets of her flaxen hair it Floating in the summer air ♪ Fair as a lily, joyous and free it Light of that prairie home was she ♪ Everyone who knew her felt the gentle power ♪ Of Rosalie, "The Prairie Flower" ♪ That sure was pretty singing, Ms Cuddy. I got some cheese. Cheese? Yes, ma'am. You know I got a few sheep now. I know. Well, I made some cheese out of their milk. I wonder if you'd like to have some. I got some here in my pocket. Well, cheese would be a fine finish to our fried chicken dinner and peach pie this evening. Well, then... Here it is. This is fine cheese, Bob. So why not marry? - Do what? - Why not throw in together? Land, animals, implements, lives. The whole ball of wax. We could use my capital and know-how to improve your claim and mine. And if the union produces children, so much the better. Looked at from any angle, it works. So why not marry? I reckon I'll go back east to find me a wife. Please, Mr Giffen. I won't take no for an answer. Ms Cuddy, I appreciate the offer, and the supper, and the concert and all, but I cannot marry you. Will not. Won't. I ain't perfect, but you are too bossy. And too plumb damn plain. Ain't no medicine for it. This one here's still breathing a little bit, Mama. Oh, my Jesus. To what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend? Springtime, Ms Cuddy! Are Clydene and the kids getting along all right'? Meaner than ever, and growing by the minute. Put your mule up, and come on inside the house. Yam! There's been some trouble amongst the women hereabouts. I've heard about it. It's bad. Guess what I'm ordering? - I couldn't. - A melodeon. - You are not. - Yep. I don't trust shipping a piano. So soon as I get into Loup, I'm gonna order a Mason & Hamlin melodeon. Well, you'll have the only melodeon in the Territory. Back home, I used to play the piano by the hour. I can't live without real music much longer. I could help you with them dishes. I don't want any help with the dishes. So, uh, how you getting along with that Giffen boy? He uses my mules when I don't need them. He helps me with my corn. We planted some potatoes together, and we keep the fences up. How you gettin' along? When my bulls finish their work here, I let him turn them out on his heifers. Well... Seems like you're getting along together all right. - I feed him a meal every now and then. - Like you do me. You're a good citizen, Mary Bee. The bed up on the loft has fresh linen on it. Take the slop out to the hogs before you go to sleep. Hell, no. This here's a goddamn free country, Dowd. Can't nobody make me do it. Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain, Vester. - Especially not in his own house. - I won't go. - I can't. - Why not'? In the name of our Saviour, Vester, I ask you, "Why not?" I can't take no time away from my crops, and I got the girls to look after, and I can't afford to pay for no wagon. - I ain't in on this deal. - Then what are we gonna do about Theoline'? Pitch her down a hole in the outhouse. You are a poor specimen of a man, Vester Belknap! I came here for the drawing. - Me, too. - Let's get it over with. - Oh, what about Vester? - I'll draw for Vester. What do you mean? I said I will draw for him. What did she say? I said I will draw for Vester Belknap. Can we proceed? This is a painful occasion for you and your families, and I grieve for you. Your wives are fine and godly women. But life gave them more than they could bear. Now, we will draw lots. Whoever draws the black bean, will carry the women home to where they come from. Shall we defer to the lady? - I'll draw last. - I'll go first. Keep your hands closed until everybody's drawn. Thor. Ms Cuddy. Put your hands in a circle here. On the count of three. One. - If that bean in my hand is black... - Two. - Hush, boy. - Three. Does that mean Vester has to go? - But he said he wouldn't. - He has to. He's one of us. - I baptized him. - I don't trust Vester. Me, neither. It's true, Reverend. Vester is a brute with no conscience. I'll go. - You can't. - Yes, I will. A woman? Well, I can ride as well as anybody. And handle a team, and shoot. You all know that. And I can cook, and care for those women better than any of you can. Hell, she's right. She's sure as hell right. That's mighty kind of you, Ms Cuddy. You tell us what you need. - We'll... We'll see to it. - When will you leave'? - As soon as I can. - Today's May 5th. She could be back in time to celebrate 4th of July with us. Reverend Dowd, we cannot allow this. It is not a lone woman's place to drive a wagon across this country. Much less when it carries three of the Lord's... least capable children. Then why not go with me, Mrs Linens? We could do it together. You too, Mrs Polhemus. Better still. No. You have husbands and family to care for, as you should. But I do not, because I live uncommonly alone. Enough. Please, be seated. I'm afraid you all are right about Vester Belknap. He's untrustworthy with a task of this gravity. And we need a homesman. We will do everything we can to equip and accommodate you for this journey, Ms Cuddy. If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute. - You come to look after your wagon? - I did. My Lord. What is that? That's a frame wagon, traded for it last year. Since then, it's been sittin' out here in the snow. When Svendsen and Sours come around here wanting a wagon, I gave them a hell of a deal on it. I give it to 'em. I cut the windows a little bigger. Greased it real good. Set some new spokes and felloes. That's just the right thing for them women. I put a sliding bolt on that door. What for? Lock them ladies in. Why would I do that? Stop and think about it. Oh. What's that? You might want to tie something down. Put in 10 of 'em. Oh, my. I'm not sure I'm ready. Are you scared? - A little. - Listen here, Mary Bee. You got a passable rig, mules, and you're as good a man as any man hereabouts. And you're doing a hell of a fine thing. So go ahead on. Get to it. And do it. Does everybody know? - Yep. - What do they say'? Don't say nothin'. People like to talk about death and taxes, but when it comes to crazy, they stay hushed up. Ms Cuddy! Mary Bee! Mary Bee! Whoa. I tried to catch you in town, but you was already gone. - What do you want, Reverend? - To give you these. They're letters to the women's closest of kin around Hebron, Iowa, and on back east. Your journey will be long, difficult, and dangerous. - I expect it will. - God bless you, woman. Bless you and keep you. You know I believe in you, don't you'? - I truly do. - I know it. I'd go in your place if I could. Now, let us pray. Heavenly Father, look down upon thy daughter, and bless her in this undertaking. Grant her thy strength, guide her with thy grace that she may carry home these poor souls. We beg of thee. In the name of Jesus Christ, thy only begotten Son, who gave his life for the sins of man. Amen. Come on out of there, you claim-jumping son of a bitch! Come on down in here, and you'll be a sad bastard as long as you live, and that won't be very long! And you're a son of a bitch, too, you bastard! But this here is Bob Giffen's place! Bob Giffen's done gone and abandoned this place, and I have filed a new claim with lawyers! Get the hell off my roof, or face legal recourse! Goddamn it, I got lawyers! We need to hang that son of a bitch. Come on. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Are you an angel? - You're not dead. - Help me. Would you help me? For God's sake? Suppose I do. What will you do for me? Anything! Anything, as God is my witness. If I cut you down, will you do what I tell you to? Hell, yes, I will! I swear to God! - Swear to it? - I swear. Swear to that Almighty God you been talking about? Uh... "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord," and "Bringing in sheaves," and "Do unto others." And if you cut me down from this goddamn tree, I'll do anything you tell me to. I swear on God's holy name. Please? All right. I'll save you. I got a job of work for you. But if you try and hurt me, or you try and run away... ({GASPS) - I'll kill you. Take off the noose. I'll need to collect my possibles. Whoa, whoa. - This is Bob Giffen's place. - I never met him. - What happened to his sheep? - I ate 'em. And now you've been blasted out by vigilantes and hanged for jumping Bob's claim. Hell, that's abandonment. Look at it. He didn't abandon nothing. He just went back east to find himself a wife. It's abandoned. I am sure is. This is abandonment. Damn. Shit. Whoa. Unhitch and stable the mules. And tend to my mare, Dorothy, and see to it that all the stock on the place is fed and watered. Your horse needs feed, too. Or if you don't care to, I will. And then your supper will be an hour late. Get up that way, son! Get up here now! Come on! Step up! Come on. Get over there! Clean up before you come in here. What's this job of work you have in mind? I'll be grateful if you'd not use my good chair that way. My name is Cuddy. Mary Bee Cuddy. - Where's Mr Cuddy? - I'm unmarried. What's the job? Three women in this country have lost their minds. Their husbands can't care for them properly. You and I are gonna take them back across the river to Iowa. - The Missouri River? - We leave tomorrow. Hell, that's five goddamn weeks from here. I will not sit still for profanity in my house. I can see why you're single. I need someone who can hunt and guide, and spell me at the reins, and help with the animals on the trip. It's why I set you free. It's your job, and you've sworn to do it. Three crazy women for five weeks is a lot more than I bargained for. If you've lied to me, and intend on abandoning your responsibility, then you are a man of low character. More disgusting pig than honourable man. Thank you for the kind words, sister. You're no prize yourself. You're plain as an old tin pail, and you're bossy. But I'll set out with you because I said I would. And I'll help you tend your cuckoo clocks as long as it suits me. However, I will up and leave when, where, and if I please. Now, if you don't mind me asking you, where the hell is my goddamn bed? In the stable, where you belong. The Wind's blown all the corn over. I know it. All we can do is burn the cobs in the stove. There ain't no corn for us to eat. Just cobs, just bare old cobs. I know it. - The wheat and oats are dead. - I know it, Line. What do you know? Are you crazy? Pull up here. - You better lock me in the wagon. - Why? I done cheated in one rope, I don't want to chance another. Them sons of bitches will try to hang me again. Oh. You might be recognised. - You got any money? - Some. Why? I need three boxes of paper cartridges for a Navy Colt .36, and a jug of whisky. Bullets, maybe, but no whisky. Why not? Can't have you getting drunk around poor, defenceless women. No. Well, then I won't go east with you. Goodbye, Cuddy. - What's your name? - That's my business. I'm going to the bank, and I need your name. Oh, well. Um, let's say George. George what? Um, Briggs. George Briggs- That's right. George Briggs. George Briggs! Read this. Here, I'll read it for you. "Mr George Briggs, care of Mrs Altha Carter, "Ladies' Aid Society, Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa." So? I put bank notes worth $300 inside this envelope. It's for you. Well, why not let me have it now? Right this minute I'm going to the post office to put it in the mail. Well, why not carry it along with us? When we get to Hebron, Mrs Carter will have it for you. Her boy's not very old. We'll have to watch him close. I don't know what he'll do when we take Arabella away. Ma'am. Well, there she is. My wife Belle. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Sours. She won't say nothing, Ms Cuddy. She just sets and looks out the window. It's like her body's all stoved up. I have to carry her to the outhouse, undress her nights, dress her in the morning. How long has she been like this? Ever since. I don't even know her no more. How old is your wife? Nineteen. And you? Twenty-one. I see. My, but she was beautiful, Ms Cuddy. She may be once again. Mr Briggs, will you interrupt your leisure long enough to lend a hand? Now? I wish you God's comfort, Garn. Here's this, too. Her grandma's wedding gift. I reckon it should go with her. I'll keep it for her, and see she takes it home. We'll be back in a few weeks. You'll hear from me through Reverend Dowd that she's safe. GEORGE". Step up there. Yaw.! Goodbye! Goodbye! You don't love me. You won't even look at me! You don't give a tinker's damn! Just go on home, and play with that damn doll! Leave me up against it! You don't love me! Goodbye! For all I care, you can just go to hell! Goodbye! You don't love me! Good morning, Mr Svendsen. Come in. - She's ready. - Why is she tied'? "God will strike you down," she says to me. She thinks she's God. Her cousin will pick her up in Iowa and take her to the asylum. How will we get her loaded? Unbolt the wagon door. Open the wagon door! Help me. Push her in. Do not untie her. She'll try to kill you. She'll try to kill her too. Out! Out! - What are you doing with that son of a bitch? - Oh... He's going with us. He's the one who tried to take over Bob Giffen's place. I need help. Surely you understand. He was supposed to hang. - Mr Svendsen. - Get down off that wagon. Get down off that wagon right now, or I will shoot you where you sit. I can't do this alone. I need him. Now you leave us be. Get us moving. You boys didn't have the balls to hang me. You wanted my horse to do it for you, didn't you? Come on. Let's go. Get up, there. Go on. Keep that gun on that son of a bitch. I'll watch over your wife, Mr Svendsen, I promise. She'll be safe with me. You girls go to your room while I talk to your mama. Theoline, this is Mary Bee. - Undo. - Undo your hands? I am. Undo. Undo. Undo. Undo. Undo. - Do you know me, Theoline? - Undo. Undo. Undo. Line, darling. I'm Mary Bee, your friend. Fa! Don't you know me? Da! Da! Da! Now, listen, girls. Your mother's very sick. But she loves you just the same as she always has. And you must love her too and help her as much as you can. Here are some things I want you to do for her. I want you to undress her, heat some water and give her a nice bath. With soap. From face to feet. - Right on the bed? - Right on the bed. Wash and dry her hair too. Then brush and comb it. Then find some clean clothes for her, and underwear. And dress her again. And while you do all this, I want you to smile at her and say kind things. Do you know a little song you can sing? We know Flow Gently, Sweet Afton. That would be fine. And when you've finished all this, I want you to do some chores for your father too. You're now the ladies of the house. I want you to sweep it out. Wash the dirty dishes. Take the bedding outdoors and air it. Show him how grown up you are. Will you do that for him? For me? All right. Now start singing. It Flow gently, sweet Afton - Good. And remember... - ♪ Amang thy green braes - Love your dear mother. - ♪ Flow gently, I'll sing thee Now you get busy as bees.

I doubt it. Not without a good feedin' of corn. The one twitchin' her ears, she knows she's the subject of our discussion. She's the thinker. The other one's the worker. They should have names. What should we name them? Mules don't need names. They need feed, and corn's the best there is. I'll name that one Grace, and that one Redemption. My mare, her name's Dorothy, after my sister. She's married to a doctor up in New York state. That's where we're from. Dorothy has a little 6-year-old boy and a baby on the way. Our mother died when we were little girls. What's your horse's name? Brown. You didn't give me but two damn skinny blankets. It gets cold at night out here. You noticed. We need to head southeast, follow the river bottoms. No. We'll meet more people that way, in case we need help. You're gonna meet three kinds of people out here. You're gonna meet wagon trains that don't wanna see crazy people, you're gonna meet freighters who will surely rape you, and you're gonna meet Indians who'll kill you. And then rape you. After they kill me. No, we're gonna go straight east to the river. We're hauling an odd lot of freight. They are not freight, they are human beings. - They're crazy. - They're precious to the Lord. Precious to me too. Give me that skillet. About $300 worth. Wake up! Time to get movin'! Get up and go pee. Go on there, girl. Go on. Watch your head on that hub there, baby. Come on. Come on. Let's go. All right. There you go. Pee. Goddamn. Squat down. Squat down! NOW pee! God will strike you down. God will strike you down. I love trees. I don't get to see very many trees. I miss them. God will strike you... New York has lots of trees. Whoa! Surely you wouldn't defile and desecrate... You are horrible! And morbid! I don't want to be cold any more when I'm trying to sleep. I need this buffalo hide, and that dead Indian don't. I was in the dragoons. Company C, First US Dragoons. Fort Kearney. Had us a right smart scuffle one time down there in Kansas with them goddamn Kiowas. Tell me. We was headed out to Fort Leavenworth. Supply train. Six-mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses. And we had Kiowas like fleas trailing us! War paint. Sassy. Big as life and twice as natural. Wanted them horses. I see. Well, we camped down on the Arkansas River one night, and them teamsters picketed 36 mules, and they picketed 300 horses in the sand. Sand! Hell, them picket pins wouldn't hold a prairie dog in that sand. Sure enough, that night... Kiowas come through there and stampeded the whole bunch, and away they went. Whoo-ee. Trampled the wagons all to pieces, got the stock all tangled up in the ropes and crippled up with the flying picket pins. And them Kiowas just running through there a-whooping and a-hollering. My, oh, my, wasn't we riled. We blew the bugle, boots and saddles, and away we went after them with the sun rising. We caught Kiowas here and we caught Kiowas there, and we caught 'em in bunches and killed every one of 'em. Rounded up our stock and drove it right through the middle of the goddamn Kiowa camp. Tore it all to hell. Pretty fair job of work. Company C, First US Dragoon. How interesting.

Somewhere along the line they killed themselves a US Cavalry bugler. - What do they want? - Whatever we got. The trouble is, they don't know what that is. They never seen a wagon like this. Could be goods inside. Soldiers. Anything, to them. Hell, they don't know. I count four rifles amongst 'em. If they think we're worth the trouble, we're dead. I'll try to buy 'em off. Whoa! If something happens to me and they come all the way down here, don't you fool with that carbine. You get in the wagon quick as you can. You shoot the women in the head and then shoot yourself. You have four good rounds. Go on. Go on. Get around here. Go on. Giddy up. Get outta here! What will they do with Dorothy? They'll probably eat her. What the hell? She's gone, Mr Briggs. Mr Briggs, she's gone! She's gone. We have to get her back. Cuddy, it was a goddamn horse. Get up, you lout! She hasn't taken a step by herself since we put her on the wagon. Hell's bells. That gal done run off. - Morning! - Morning. Where you from, friend? Freight train camped down south a little ways. - A big 'un? - Thirty wagons, six yoke. Two weeks out of Falls City, headed for Salt Lake. - You a driver? - I am! Out huntin' meat. You seen any? No. Not today. I'm out looking for this young lady here. - She's lost. - She ain't now. Friend, I got a frame wagon back there. I'm carrying three crazy women to a church in Iowa so they can go home, back east. This young girl is one of 'em. She's married. Her name is Sours. She had three little childrens and lost 'em all to the diphtheria in short order, and she lost her mind. She run away from us last night. - I'm her friend. - So am I. No, you wouldn't want her, not the way she is. She can spread her legs, can't she? All right, tell you what. Why don't we leave it to her? See here, sweet thing. Who'd you rather go with, him or me? Well, there you be. She cottons to me already. Friend, I'm taking this girl home. Not likely. She's mine now. Possession is nine points of the law. And it's all of us out here now, ain't it? Sorry, I'll just have to have her. God almighty! Fight you for her. Best man takes the prize. How's that? - I'm agreeable. - All right. When I say pitch, we pitch these guns. How's that? Anytime. Pitch! God almighty! Say it again and act right this time. Pitch! Goodbye. Did you have to take an eternity? She's nearly froze to death. You lost one horse, Cuddy. Here's you another one. - Where'd you get this horse? - Man let us have him. Why would he do that? Because he was dead. Mrs Sours shot him. Whoa. Who would do such a thing? Indians. For the clothes. Wolves. "Cissy Hahn. "Eleven years, two months, nine days. "God loved her and took her home unto him." Let's go, Cuddy. I intend to tidy up this grave. - Gettin' late. - I don't care! Suit yourself. I'm goin' on. Then I'll take a horse and join you later. Not mine, you won't. You'll have to ride that paint horse. I want a shovel too. O, sweet, merciful Father... Prince Jesus... Good Shepherd... Harvester of Righteousness... Take thee this token and bury them deep. Carry and carry, in love let us sleep. Send me summons to wed thee one day. Love us and love me. O, love me, I pray. Amen. Why... Why... Why didn't you light a fire for me? What about supper? I did light a fire for you, Cuddy. Where's that shovel? I lost the goddamn shovel! Who cares about a shovel? You are insane! The hell I am, Cuddy. I'm trying to move a load to the river quick as I can and draw that $300. And that's all there is. There ain't no more. ♪ If thou should prosper it Hear my heart pray ♪ Send me a summons it To wed thee one day it Take thee this token it And love me always it But if I should perish it Thy promises keep it Take thee our two hearts it And bury them deep it Take thee our tokens ♪ In love let us sleep ♪ I couldn't sleep. I could. How long now till we get there? Well, um... A week. Thereabouts. Heck, maybe a month. Hell, I don't know. It's almost over now. Will you stay in Iowa or come back to the Territory? I don't know. You're not much for making plans. No. Not much. Mr Briggs, you're an intelligent man, and if you think on it, I'm sure you'll see the wisdom in it. After we've turned them over to Mrs Carter, why don't we marry and come back together? I'm 31 years old. If I'm ever to marry, it'd better be soon, and... You're not getting any younger. You've seen my house and my stock. I've got two fine claims and money in the bank. I'm in good health and capable of childbearing. I plan to buy shoats next spring and fatten them on corn. And come summer, I'll have 60 acres into wheat. I plan to put in pumpkins too. We'd make a good team, you and I. If we pull together, we're bound to prosper. Don't you agree? - I ain't no farmer. - Well, you could try. You could try. I tried it one time with a widder woman up north of Wamego. Up and down them goddamn rows, daylight till dark. There's prettier things to look at than the ass end of a ox. One morning I just rode off. You deserted her. When I left I was sorry, but I never did look back. I see. So you won't marry me. No. No, I won't. I know. I'm plain as an old tin pail, but would you think about it from here to Hebron and talk with me about it again? Talk's cheap. Mr Briggs, perhaps you don't realise what a grand thing you're doing, taking these poor, helpless women home. If you don't, I assure you the good Lord does, and I do. This might be the finest, most generous act of your life. It might be $300. You won't marry me? No. And I am plain. I wish you'd say one kind word to me. - Like what? - That I'm a good woman. That I've helped you. Fair enough. You're a damn good woman, Cuddy, and you've helped me. I deserted from the dragoons. That's right. Company C, 1st US. Fort Kearney. Stole a horse and away I run. I ain't attached to nothin'. Just me. No. I want to lie with you. No. You must. I saved your life. No. Please? Spare me my dignity, sir. Raise your knees. Take me in your hand. Just you remember, Cuddy. I didn't force you. - I will. - If I hurt you, I can't help it. I know. You asked me. I didn't ask you. I know. Now put me in you. Yes. Cuddy! Cuddy! My God in heaven, Cuddy. We made a deal to carry these women back to Iowa, and I kept my word, and here you done broke yours. See here? You see what you've done? You've killed her. Look at her! You killed her! Too damn crazy to pay attention to anything. Goddamn lunatics. You don't know nothin' about this world. Can't even piss straight. If it hadn't been for you, Mary Bee wouldn't be dead. She wouldn't even be out here! If you hadn't gone crazy, she wouldn't have made this trip. If you'd stayed steady and strong, she'd be alive and at home in her own house. And so would you. But no. You went crazy. And drove her crazy, and it killed her. What you got to say about that? The! Well, I'll be... I'm going on by myself. You're on your own. Far enough along here east where somebody will come along and tend to you. There ain't a damn one of you can understand a word I'm sayin'. Oh, my God. Whoa. Whoa! Phew. How do'? I'm carryin' three women outside. They hadn't had anything to eat for three days. They need supper now, rooms for the night and hot baths. We're full up. With what? People. Mister, I didn't come in here for trouble, but I am tired. And when I'm tired, I'm easy to aggravate. Now, this is a hotel. I've got money. I want supper now. Then I want a room for myself, and I want a room for three women and I want four hot baths or the reason why not. Wait here a minute. - Greetings! - How do? My name is Aloysius Duffy. - And yours is? - Briggs. I understand you're in need of a meal and accommodations, Mr Briggs. That's right. For myself and three passengers. - Women. - Oh. Unusual cargo, I must say. In any case, Mr Briggs, I regret I cannot oblige you. Why not? This is a hotel, ain't it? Have a drink on the house. Grand. Ooh. There she went. Now, then. Mr Briggs, you couldn't have shown up at a more inauspicious time. It so happens a party of 16 potential investors is coming from St Louis by steamboat and coach. I trust you recognise we cannot accommodate anyone else. These are gentlemen of means, and the fate of our entire venture may very well depend on a good... We had a bad winter. Travelled a long way to get here. And they ain't had nothing to eat for three days. I'm sorry. The women are in bad shape. They're... Awful hungry. Let me see them. Lord God! You can't turn us away. I can't. Mr Briggs. Those women are pitiful, I concede, but we can't have them here tonight, the milk of human kindness be damned. Now kindly be out the door, and take that wagon away from here. And Godspeed to you. Shoe's on the other foot now. You put them guns down on the floor real careful and get us our supper on the table right goddamn now. Shoe's back where it belongs, Mr Briggs. Grand. Well done. Be on your way, my friend. And lament you neglected my offering of whisky. All right, but I'll tell you what. You are the worst bunch of lying, thieving, pissant sons of bitches I'll ever run into. You turn you back on these poor women, you'll answer for it for the rest of your lives. You won't sleep. You'll choke on your whisky and on your water. The food you eat will block up your bowels. You'll die of your own shit. Your mothers and your sisters and your wives and your daughters will cuss your broke-dick souls. Get on! Get on! Yah! Yah! Get on! Get on! Get up! Go on! Get on, get on, get on! Yah! Get on down now! - Oh, for God's sake. - Go on! Go on! Go on! Get on now, mules! Come on! Yah! Get on! Get on! I'm gonna go get us something to eat. Now, y'all be good girls and go to sleep. I'll be back directly. You need to get on out of here. Don't look back, darlin'. Son of a bitch! Goddamn! That hurts! Ah, sweet. Step up there, mule. Step up. Come on! She looked ridiculous in that feed sack bonnet. Pardon, ma'am. I'm lookin' for a woman by the name of Altha Carter. Do you know where her house is at? That would be the minister's wife. Yes, ma'am, that's right. It would be. Go on down to the Methodist church. The house across the street. That's the parsonage. All right, ma'am. Thank you. Come, Maisy. Don't look at him. Go! Whoa, mule, whoa. Sir? Afternoon, ma'am. Are you Mrs Altha Carter, the wife of the Methodist minister? - I am. - Well, ma'am, my name is Briggs. I'm from the Territories. Loup. And I've brought you three women. Women? Oh! Oh, for goodness sakes, yes! You have been a long time coming, Mr Briggs. I am relieved you're here. I'm... I'm sorry Reverend Carter isn't. He is out burying a beloved member of our congregation. Just a minute. I thought a woman named Cuddy was bringing them. That's what Reverend Dowd wrote. She was with us up to a week ago, ma'am. I'm sorry to tell you that a fever took her. I buried her, and we moved on. Mary Bee Cuddy was her name. Hmm. Oh, what a terrible loss. She must've been a fine, brave human being. She truly was. They've ridden all this way in that box. Oh, mercy! Well, it's time to meet them. I'm not sure I'm ready. Get over there. You must have had an awful winter. We did, ma'am. Put them on the settee, Mr Briggs. - Do they speak? - No. Do they understand anything? Ma'am, I don't know. I notice their eyes move round the room. What does that mean? It's hard to tell. Perhaps each remembers a parlour from her own past. Poor, poor dears. Have you noticed any improvement in their condition'? They don't scrap with each other or try to run off any more. Tell me their names. - That's Theoline Belknap. She killed her baby. - Oh, no, no. Please, don't tell me, Mr Briggs. I don't care to know. That one there's a Norski woman by the name of Gro Svendsen. - Very well. - And that's Arabella Sours. She's only a girl. Why, she even has a doll. She had three little children and lost them all to the diphtheria in three days. Dear Lord! Please don't say any more. There's letters on all three of 'em in this bag here. About their kinfolks and all. I better move on. They might just jump up and try to follow me. Oh. I think this room will hold them. Oh, I almost forgot. This is for you, Mrs Sours. And it's lovely. Maybe you'll want it... One fine day. Well, goodbye, ladies. God bless you. They'll be all right. I want to say goodbye to you. You can give this wagon and those mules and that paint horse and everything else to the Methodist women. Maybe they can sell everything, use the money to pay for railroad fare and whatever else. Oh! Mr Briggs! I'm delighted. How very generous of you. Tell the reverend to give those mules a good feeding of corn. Will you go back to the Territory? - I don't know. - If you do... Please thank Reverend Dowd for me and wish him well. Yes, ma'am. Well, then. This is our goodbye, Mr Briggs. Give me your hand. God our Father, bless this good man wherever he may go. Keep watch over him. Cause thy face to shine upon him and bring him home to thee one day. In Jesus's name I pray. Amen. I hope we meet again, Mr Briggs. Goodbye. You can go on now. Ah, yes, sir. You look splendid, sir. - How old are you? - Sixteen. You ain't got no shoes on your feet. Well, that's my business, ain't it? - Mmm-hmm. - I'll take them shoes right there. We're playing high stakes, sir. Can you show $50? There's $300 for you. - Mind if I have a look? - Suit yourself. Have a look at this, Mr Carmichael. Bank of Loup. Up near Wamego. How long since you been there, sir? Five, six weeks. The Bank of Loup went bust. Happens all the time to sodbuster banks in the Territory. I've lost more than my fair share of this wildcat paper. - Do you have any greenbacks? - No, uh... I spent it all. I'm sorry, sir. I cannot accept these banknotes. Nobody around here will. Sorry, but you can't sit at the table unless you're playing. I'll have to ask you to leave. Why? Please leave the table, sir. You are not socially acceptable here, you see. You ever know a woman by the name of Mary Bee Cuddy? No, sir. These are for you. You still got to pay your bill. That gravy and them biscuits you made was pretty good. Thank you. I got a good piece of advice for you. When you get grown, don't marry some shit-heel kid headed West to make a claim on a farm he ain't built yet. Don't you do that. You stay here. - Why? - Because I told you to. Who is Mary Bee Cuddy? Mary Bee Cuddy was as fine a woman as ever walked. You'll never know her. - Well, then, so what? - So what? You are the living, breathing reason she will never be lost. That's what, darlin'. - You're a strange man. - I expect I am. Why don't we marry? Maybe. FERRYMAN 13 Pull away! FERRYMAN 2; Shove off!
