Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm going to tell you the story, about how I met someone remarkable. We would like to welcome you to Savanna. The temperature on the ground is 70 degrees, and the local time is... I'd just flown in for a job interview. I had already prepaid for my come-pick car, when the rental place had a water main break. I'm sorry sir, we are going to have to cancel your reservation. The car rental lot had flooded. I didn't have time for this. I was already running a little late, and I was trying to remember my answers to all the pre-interview questions I'd practiced, so I had them drop me off at the closest place. Excuse me, can you pull over? Excuse me. Then suddenly, I was standing in front of her. Thank you for choosing Savanna Car Rentals. How can I help... I can't remember which one of us smiled first. Hi. Hi. I just want to get a car. Okay. That's me, yeah. July 10th? I'm May 10th. What are the chances? Actually, the chances are one in 30, but that didn't matter. We both could feel something happening. Cool. By the end of my first four hours in Savanna, I had a job, and more importantly, I had a date. A little less than a year later, we were married, and to think, it all happened because some guy working for Savanna Water forgot to regulate the pressure. Every time, I think we should remodel. - I speak up and say, "We have to go to Paris." - Great, then let's go to Paris. And then I wake up the next morning, and say, "we have to remodel". We've been trying to decide if we want to put in a new pool in the backyard, or take that trip to Cabo. I'm very glad that we decided that we are going to do the pool. Honey, I thought we decided on Cabo? Yes, right. No, we are going to Cabo. - We are going to Cabo. - Brain fart. Wow. That must be Katie and Chuck. There are the wines. She's white, he's red. Hi. Katie, are you okay? Where's Chuck? That's why all these jobs are moving to Florida and Texas. There's no state income tax. - A part of me has always wanted to live in Texas. - All those tornadoes, - it's so dangerous. - Then, how about Florida? Florida is great. It's right next door. Well, they have a lot of hurricanes... It's... Not to mention the humidity. It's... We were supposed to go to Florida this summer. His sister's getting married. We have the plane tickets already, and the hotel, and my... My... bridesmaid's dress, and he even said, it was going to be like our second honeymoon. But then he screwed a girl he met online. Katie, would you like to lie down or... Guys, I'm fine. I'm going to be a divorce wedding planner. That's great. More Syrah, anyone? - Yes. - Yes. Yes, okay. Jan might have some Xanax. Steve and Sabrina just liked our photo. They just said, where's their invite? - I've always liked them. - Yes, they are nice. We haven't seen them in a while. We should invite them to the next barbecue. Maybe we can have a cookout competition. He's always bragging about his brisket. - It's not that good. - No, it's too dry. - No way. - What? Chuck just changed his status to single. - He did? - Yes. Well, that is disgusting. You should unfriend him. - No, okay. - It's up to you. Only do it if it's what you really want. If we go, I'll buy you the first three rounds. - If he doesn't go, you owe me. - I could take that. - Prove me right, Nate. - No, prove me wrong. We've got an extra ticket for the game tonight. He thinks if we offered to you, you won't go. - He thinks you will. - It's the first three rounds on the winner. - Guys, I can't. - There it is. - Victory. - I would love to, but I can't. Tonight, I've got plans... Susan, steak, chips, game shows waiting at home? That was last night actually. No, tonight's remodeling shows. Susan and I are re-doing the new bathroom. She'd kill me if I missed it, but I'll go with you guys next time. You realize you tell us that every single week, right? Look, it's cool. Just tell us you'd rather go home and hang with your wife. - We'll stop asking. - No, it's just... If I start going out on a guys' night, then she'll start going on girls nights, and then before you know it, I'm only going to see her on the weekends. - And that's wrong because? - Weekends are for projects. - Projects? - Yes, mowing the lawn, painting the trim, building a new deck. Look, Susan and I made a commitment to make our commitment work, - and you know what that takes? - Masochistic guilt? No, it takes commitment. When you guys find the right relationship, you'll love that commitment. No, man, you're right. You're right. I mean, we are just gonna go to the game, we're going to get hammered, we're going to probably embarrass ourselves... - Yes. - ...in front of some coeds. But you, you'd rather go home to your wife. That's amazing. - Yes. - Seriously, man. - You're kind of lucky. - I tell myself that every day. Just to clean down these walls. Free it up from all the... That is a great idea for a backsplash. What do you think? I don't know. What do you think? - Maybe. - Yes, maybe. - Love you. - Love you, too. Well, we want to do the infinity pool because it looks amazing, but... Grab your glasses. He's Riesling, she's champagne. - Hi. - Hello. I can't eat it. I thought you loved cheesecake? I do, but I made a deal with Deborah. She stops using her passive-aggressive manipulation to make me go visit her mother, and I lose ten pounds. Well, eh, commitment takes compromise. No, it takes ignorance. - What's this? - Some event the city's hosting. They're looking for a design for the new concert hall. - Cool, are you going? - Christ. I wish, but I've got Deborah's third annual organic guacamole competition that she hosts every year with her sisters. - That sounds fun. - Yes, if you don't have a dick. You should go to that though. They have free food, free booze, and who knows, you might even get inspired to design something. Right. It's the wife. Time to compromise. - Hey. - Hey, I left some frosting off the list this morning, so can you pick some up? It's in aisle three, next to the flour. Yes, but frosting for what? I told Dan and Jan that we would bring a cake on Friday. - Nate? - Yes, sorry. Do we really want to go to that? I mean, it's just to celebrate the first day of construction on the new pool. - What else would we do? - Well, I was thinking, the city is hosting this event to find architects to design the new concert hall and, I don't know, I thought it sounded like it could be fun. - Susan? - Yes. No, I mean, we could go, but last time we went to one of those things you were bored out of your mind and you made me promise that we would never go again. Besides, we already told Dan and Jan we would be there. You know what? It was unbearable. Intolerable, but it's up to you. I'll only do it if it's what you really want. Hello. Susan? - What's wrong? - It just hit me, okay? This wave of emotion, this feeling and I don't know how to describe it, but every part of me realize that every part of me is just... Unhappy? Miserable. Miserable? Miserable? How is that even possible? One minute I'm on the phone and we're debating what to do Friday night and then the next, you tell me that you're miserable. How the fuck is that even possible? It just is, okay? No, no, listen to me. Let's talk about this. What can we do? What can I do to fix this? I wish I knew. I really think I just needed to put this all in perspective. I mean, what marriage didn't have a little bump in the road? A hill to climb. I figured that when our friends heard about this Friday night, they'd cut the cake and toast to Nate's night out. - Good morning. - Oh my. Nate, what the hell are you doing? I just thought we could talk. I brought us some coffee. Okay, but don't just barge in on me when I'm naked. What are you talking about? I've seen you naked a thousand times. I don't get what the big deal is. Look, we're having some issues and I don't want to complicate things. I don't have any issues. You said you were unhappy. I'm not unhappy. - I love our life, our marriage, getting to sleep in my own bed. - I know. - I feel different, okay? - Different? Better. - What do you mean, better? - What do you think I mean? Do you want me to lie to you? Maybe. But the fourth wife, she was a real looker. We both got our money's worth on that one. So, do you think you, uh, could ever get married again? No. No, no, no, no. I don't think so. I'm... I'm so unlucky. If it were raining pussies, the one that would land on my head would have a dick already in it. All right, moving on. Ed, how about you, any movement with your action items this week? Yes. I finally got rid of that hyphen at the end of my name, so I'm no longer Ed Smith-Myers. I'm just Ed Smith. Congratulations, Ed. You're making real progress. I'm proud of you. Nate, how about you? Would you like to share with the group? Hi, I'm Nate. I just came to check this out because American Voices is finished for this season, so I had a little bit of extra time this week. I don't really know what I'm doing here. I know, I got really lucky, I was able to get an earlier flight. It means we can definitely make it to Peter and Penny's potluck. Yes, yes, I'll pick up a bottle of Syrah. You look like the expert. Are the waffles here any good? Are the waffles here any good? Yes, yes, they're okay. I had better. My wife actually makes really good waffles. Wholegrain, soy milk, egg whites and we only use grade A maple syrup, medium amber in the little maple leaf bottle from Vermont. Susan has this way of pouring the maple syrup into every other square, there's never too much but never too little. She would even take the butter out of the fridge an hour before we ate so it softens, then when it hits the top of the waffle, it just melts in every direction. I bet you can't wait to get home. I placed the Blueridge mountain, the problem is we got to use it. - We go back and forth and I say... - Hey, Nate. - I have to go to Asheville and he says... - How's it going? - I feel like it's been a while. - Yes, it has, hasn't it? We cannot decide. Nate, what a surprise. Yes, it is a surprise, isn't it? You're having a dinner party with all our friends as if nothing even happened. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm really good. Thanks for asking. I'm getting along just swell. I'm really glad that you're making good use of our time apart. The space that you wanted so bad is treating you well. Then hey, - it's just shits and giggles here at my expense, isn't it? - It's not like that, - let's just go upstairs and talk. - Holy shit. Is that the new 65-inch 4K HDTV with crystal clear pixilation, the one that I wanted to get instead of redoing the bathroom? Okay, the rocking ribs are ready to be tasted. Who wants some more pinot? Oh. Hey, how's it going? I'm Nick. Good to meet you. - What's your name? - My name is Nate Brown. - Nate Brown. - It's on the mail that comes here. It's on the cable bill. - Nate, can we please just talk about this... - You know what? It's really not the fact that you're screwing my wife that bothers me, because honestly, that I could get over, but Susan, if you're going to let this guy wear my "kiss the cook" apron, use my dripless basting brush and cook in my 44-inch combo grill, then I'm sorry, but you're nothing but a filthy whore. I'm just having a really hard time adjusting to everything right now. - Hard, how? - Well... I... I just feel like my whole life is turned upside down, right? And I don't know where to start, you know. I'm also dealing with some pretty big issues at the moment like not being allowed back into my own house that I bought and paid for. But then, there's also like the little things that bother me even more than being homeless. Like I passed our Thai food place the other night. We loved Thai food, it was our favorite and every time we'd go, I would get the chicken skewers and she would get the garlic beef and then we'd share. And it's like... What the fuck am I supposed to do now? I mean, I can't get both. Hey. It's just going to take some time. How long have you been coming here? 15 years. I would've gone to Paris. No, she remodels. Nate? Nate Brown. It's Katie, Katie Franco, - used to be Hamilton. - Oh, Katie. Katie, hi! What the hell happened to you? I'll take that as a compliment. And you look like you always did. Really? Because half of me is divorcing the other half. - Aw, you too? - M-hm. So, what are you up to now? You still helping the betrothed march to their emotional death? - God, no. - Really? That... that was your life. You lived for it. No, I had what could be innocently described as a complete fucking meltdown where I lost my cool on a customer to the point where they called off the engagement. Probably good you quit. Are you kidding? It was like the best day of my life. I... suddenly felt empowered and inspired and it allowed me to shed the past and take hold of my own life. I thought from that moment on of my breakup as my wakeup, as the moment in my life when I said, "I am my own person. I'm not just half of Katie and Chuck. I'm Katie Franco." and the fun of the single thing is starting over. Don't commiserate, celebrate. - What is there to celebrate? - You. Your newfound freedom, your independence. - The new life you're about to embark on. - Celebrate being single? My... my marriage was everything to me. Operative word: Was. You got to start living in the now. - Fuck the past. - Fuck the past? - Seize your future. - Carpe diem? Listen, you guys planned a wedding, right? That was just one big party. Why don't you throw another one? I don't know, I guess I could try. I just don't know if I could pull it off. Seems like a lot to celebrate just moi. Who else would you rather celebrate? Well, listen. Call me if you need me. I'm back to being an accountant. Taxes after a divorce can be a bit tricky. Cele... ...brate. 7:00 p.m. This is so out of character. I'm honestly surprised he came up with it himself. Really? You think? If that was my ex-husband, I... I would sabotage the party and make a complete ass out of him in front of all of his loser friends. Hypothetically speaking, you know. Jan loves her little hypotheticals. - You know, I just... Throwing a party is hard. - It's tough. It's not just buying a six-pack and serving some onion dip, it's... it's a lot more, you know. I always planned who's coming and what we would serve and where they would sit, you know? I always made him feel like he was involved. Yeah, he always had those amazing syrupy sweet and spicy ribs. - Seriously? It was seriously not syrupy. - Misspoke. And if I hadn't added white pepper to the rub, it would have been bland. And if I didn't constantly baste the ribs, it would've burned. If I didn't serve merlot, he would've served chardonnay, so. - That would not have gone... - You can't do that. After the term alimony? Permanent alimony. Her pension contribution entitlement, her car insurance. Her healthcare coverage. I see 17% of my salary. One-seven. No wonder I feel 83% like shit. The irony? Before our first date, I dreamed of fucking her and now she's fucking me. Right up the ass. Okay. Uh... Anyone else have anything they'd like to add? I have something. Uhm... I was actually trying to think about this divorce thing in a whole new way. So instead of feeling like shit about it, I decided why not have a party? I'm... I'm sorry, why not have a what? A divorce party. Nate... I... I think that might be misdirecting some of the pain that you're feeling. Yeah, why would you want to do that? I mean, you could think about it any way you want, but you'd still be broadcasting your failure to the world. We come in here to share our lives with each other, but we keep it in this room. You want to share your misery with the world? Fine, but for me, I... I'd rather be safe in here, than deal with what's going on out there. I need to understand how I, a guy that I think is pretty normal, not offensive, only rarely loses his temper in public, only has one guest attending his party. - What party? - The divorce party. The one that you RSVP'd to? Oh, yeah. Here it is. Well, first of all, I RSVP yes to every invite. It doesn't mean I'm going, it means that you think I'm going. So for the next week, if I see you at spin class, you don't think I'm lame for saying no. Then, about an hour before the party starts, I send you an email with something along the lines of, "Oh my God, I'm so sorry I can't make it. But do a shot for me. Love you. Katie." So you weren't coming either? No, of course not. - Okay. - Listen, Nate. I don't know what to tell you. You decided to throw a party and now you're realizing that without your marriage, no one feels obligated to show up just for you. Why not? Because you used to be half of something and now you're all of nothing. - Don't you think that's kind of your fault? - Oh, my fault? Yeah. I mean, you gave me the whole, "Don't commiserate, celebrate" speech. Nate, please. Look at your invite. Chips and dip at the Savannah Inn Express isn't a party, it's pathetic. - I got the Double Deluxe Suite. - Nate, if you want to have a successful divorce party, - you got to treat this as if... - As if what? As if it was as important as your wedding. Okay. Look, if I had 30 grand to spend, I'd throw something cool, - but I don't have that kind of money. - Are you telling me your new life is only worth a bag of tortilla chips and a jar of salsa? Because that's what I'm hearing. Okay, think about it. If you were getting married somehow, you and your over-eager bride would find the money to flaunt your new life together, right? Why don't you throw it for me? What? I mean, you love doing that. You lived for it. No. What I lived for was a feeling, you know? The rush of making a memory that could maybe carry somebody through a lifetime. Like... I was creating a piece of art, and I was the artist, but that was the past. Your specialty was sending people off into the world, with the memory of the best day of their lives. Help me have a new best day of my life. Make me a work of art. Please? Okay. If you can find the money to pay my full fee and allow me to plan something with the bells and whistles that keeps my former reputation intact, then I'll do it. Okay. - Okay, are we good? - Okay. All right. Look at that body. Fuck, yeah. Ooh, yeah. Come on, baby. Oh, Jesus Christ already! Nate! What the hell are you doing here? Oh, my God. I thought you'd be at work. There must be some reason, some urgent need that absolutely could not wait. - Well, I need my tennis shoes. - Your tennis shoes? Yeah, I looked in the closet and on the shoe rack and I just... Yeah, dude, yeah right behind my ab-roller. Yeah. Yes, little guy, huh? He's... Size eight and a half, right? Nine and a half. Yeah, thank you. Okay. There I was standing in front of my soon to be ex and her buck naked boyfriend and it was clear, the ring meant absolutely nothing to her. It was like she was void of that gush of emotion that she had when I proposed. I spent weeks, months even researching the stupid four C's: cut, color, clarity, and carat. I organized a flash mob for the perfect proposal. I even hired dancers to present the ring. I mean, the fucking absurdity of this invented tradition where men have to bust their ass and spend three months salary just to express their undying devotion. I mean, when the hell did that start? When men were stupid enough to fall for it. I don't know, maybe I should just give it back. Well, the courts look at an engagement ring as a promise of a marriage, and that the bride fulfills that promise, and your ex certainly did. It's supposedly hers, free and clear. - You think I should return it? - Hell no, it's a bullshit law. Hock that ring and you get as much money for it as you can, fuck her. This is the Bridal Bible, all my girls used to get one. It's the "how to" for the "I do" even if we're celebrating the death of your marriage. Since you've been lost in the delusional fairy tale of marriage, how about something truly romantic? Maybe even a mask party where we reveal the new Nate Brown. Hm? What do you think? I don't know. How about this, you've got a sweeping view of the water, what's not to love? And we could even do maybe like, a little spiritual cleansing in the river. I don't know. I thought this could be the perfect place to be loud and proud about your new life. What do you think? Maybe. What about something exotic like Indian food? - We don't like Indian. - What do you mean we? I mean me. - That is bitching. - Yeah, and if I serve that, everyone's going to think I'm a huge a bitch. Maybe, it's cushy. It's cringe-worthy. I don't want people to think that I have all of this pent-up emotions, this bitter pill that I'm forcing them to swallow. This looks like a Halloween cake. Besides, no one even likes white icing, do they? I mean, it's just a cake. I set the seating at a 100. We can always adjust up if we need to or down for that matter. I don't understand why we're working on a seating chart when I don't have any guests yet. - That's exactly my point. - And it's valid, but I don't have anyone to invite. All of my so-called friends were just bodies that would come over two by two for bland wine and safe conversation. Trust me, I remember that. Your revolving list of couple friend guests. Listen, it doesn't matter, because I'm pretty sure those people are going to go to Susan's party anyways. Of course, she's having a party. She lives for those things. Exactly, so why don't you let her live her life while you go define yours. Go find some people you actually want to be around. 39 trees, 39. It's got to have greenery. - Hey, guys. - Hey, man. Just wanted to see what you guys were up to this weekend. See If you wanted to have some brewskis or tease some tail or something. I'm sorry, tease some tail? Yeah, you know, go out and just... Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. I'm fine. - Well, better than fine. - You don't have to lie. I'm not, lie about what? A guy's wife who's in my fantasy league, who also take yoga with Jan, who apparently attends your dinner parties, told us that Susan kicked you out. Why weren't we invited to those dinner parties? We're just... We're working through some issues. - She's divorcing you. - That is one of the issues. Look, those dinner parties were boring. I was bored. - You guys would have been bored. - All right, look, we see through your little charade here. Clearly, everything isn't hunky dory in Brown manor and now that there's no Susan, I'd say you're a little desperate to hang out with us. Desperate? I'm not desperate. - What do you think? - We're going to that thing this weekend. - All right, look. Here's the deal, dude, no. - No. - Not in this condition. - What condition? You're like a caged man in the zoo of life, a sad little Panda cub that's been protected behind bars, suckling milk from your mother's tits and now, you don't have a mommy anymore. Trust us, this is for your own safety. If we put you into the wild, you'd be killed. I can survive in the wild, okay? I can be a tiger. I can kill. - Seth. Hey, man. - Good to see you. Heidi, what's up, baby? Looking good. - Hey. - Yo. Alright. Hi, just be cool, right? Mingle. It's good to be out, you know, on my own, solo, kicking it. Not having to worry about what time I get home tonight, so I can make some stupid brunch plans in the morning, do you know what that's like? I mean, dude, I spent so much time worrying about Susan this, Susan that. Trying to keep her happy for her to turn around one day and tell me that she's unhappy. What the fuck is up with that? I mean it's okay. At least I'm not one of those guys that has to talk about it all the time. - You know? - All right, baby. Your turn to drink, let's go, okay. Chug, chug, chug. Chug, chug, chug. Chug. I got you. Chad, badass rad Chad. What's up, motherfucker? Hey dude, all kidding aside, - you're a really awesome guy, man. - Yeah. Yeah. - Cool, man. - I love you, buddy. Hey, we should hang out sometime. What do you put in your hair, too? How do you get it to... - What do you mean hang out? - I don't mean that in a gay way. Like, I'm not trying to pick you up or take you to like a homo bar or something. Right, so if you were, you know, trying to pick me up, would that be a bad thing? No, that's what I'm saying. You're a really good looking guy, but I'm not gay. - You know, I feel bad for the gays, though. - Oh, yeah? Adopting children, and marriage equality, and like... Fuck marriage, man. It's bad enough being married to the opposite sex, why the fuck would you want to be married to the same sex, you know what I mean? Sorry. Hey. Hey, guys. Do you guys want a drink? - Fuck no, I don't want a drink. - Why would you hit on Chad? - Yeah, what were you thinking? - What do you mean? Oh, dude, come on. We're cool. Hey, Chad, Chad, do you want a drink? - Watch, I got this. - Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Yeah? Listen, I don't know who the hell you think you are, but I think I speak for everyone here when I tell you that it's time for you to go home. I think you're in serious need of inspiration. - I think you need a date. - A date? Yes, not a girlfriend, not a wife, not someone to help you plan everything. Just someone who might actually enjoy your company during your divorce party. A date? - At least I have one person coming. - Exactly, maybe a little momentum will help figure everything else out. Where do you want me to find somebody? I don't know if you know, but I'm not the best at socializing. It's strange, really. If the flood hadn't delayed my flight... I would have been bored sitting there at my laptop looking at dating sites. I mean, what are the chances? Tell me more about yourself. Well, I've always wanted to go to Ireland. It just... it looks so pristine online. Which isn't to say that I feel the need to go jet-setting across the world all the time or anything like that. I have this really great couch at home. It's white. Shabby chic. So comfortable for watching TV. - It's just too big. - Too big? Yes. I mean, whether it's on the couch... - Or the beach... - Or even on the moon... It's just not the same unless someone's there by your side watching remodeling shows with you. - Do you like your job? - It's a job. That's all it is, really. I know I shouldn't feel that way about my career, but I don't care. I told them I don't want to go into management. Because I need time to live. To nurture the relationships in my life. To find someone. - I want to bury it at the party. - Want to get some - flowers and a tombstone for it also? - I'm serious, Nick. I want to do this. I need to do this. I think it's going to be really therapeutic, you know? It will help me just get rid of the ring for good. - One final symbolic gesture. - If you say so, baby. - Makes sense, right? - Yeah, it makes sense to you, it makes sense to me. Great. You've got to be kidding me. What are you doing? Reliving the best day of my life. Nate, the whole idea is to make your divorce party your new best day. I don't want a new best day. I just want to lie here until they find my corpse fused to the comforter. What? What do you want? I hate to tell you, but your bridal bible planning guide sucks. Finding a date was meant to help me to get over Susan. Every girl felt like some kind of version of Susan, - except they weren't Susan. Now I can't stop thinking about... - Susan? Jesus Christ. Enough with your whole misery routine. It's tiring. Then why was everyone so much like her? Because of this. - How did you get that? - I hacked into your account. - How do you know my password? - It's Susan and the year you were married. You said, "Willing to adjust your life goals for the right person." You prefer someone adverse to breaking up after a year and are interested in exploring the interest and hobbies of your next partner? So what? What's wrong with that? If someone really likes cycling, there's no problem with me taking time out of my day to do that with them. They want to go on a cruise ship to Mexico, then sure, why not? - Something to do. - Do you even like cycling? Or cruising? That's not the point. It shows that I'm willing to meet them in the middle. Oh. Is that where you want to live your life? In the middle? - Called compromise. - No, it's called sacrifice. Giving up who you are to be someone you're not. Sometimes that's what it takes. That's why Susan and I worked so well for all those years. How's it working for you now? Okay, throw it in. - I don't want to. - Do it. - No. - Nate. - Listen, I know how this feels. - No, you don't. I'm not as strong as you think I am. I thought you got rid of every picture of you and Chuck? Believe me, I know this is hard. I know it better than anyone else because you're not just letting go of the past, but you have to let go of the future too. The future? The memories you've dreamed of that you'll never share and the kids you won't know and the Christmases you won't celebrate and growing old together. You have to say goodbye to all of it. - Even if you know it was probably your fault. - You don't blame Chuck? You know when people say, "It's not you, it's me" and they're completely lying? Well, it actually was me. In trying to make our relationship perfect, I completely suffocated him. Come on, Nate. You can do this. Start over. And your wedding picture. And your honeymoon picture. And the picture you keep in your wallet behind your license next to the spare key that opens the house that used to be yours. - How did you... - You're like an addict. I had to search everything. Now, light it. As the memories of my past burned away, I couldn't help but wonder why they've been so damn important to me. She was right all along. Carpe diem. The future holds the memories of tomorrow and I was ready to experience every single one. Okay, so my whole plan for tonight is that you're no longer Nate. - Who am I? - You're going to choose an alter ego and role play. Trust me, this works. I used it whenever my brides were really nervous about their wedding. It breaks you out of that shell and gives you that confidence that, frankly, you have none of and desperately need. So, who do you think I should be? Whoever you want to be. It doesn't matter, but no matter who you choose to be, you have to, and I mean have to, follow my two rules. - Okay. - You cannot break character and you cannot talk about Susan. Susan who? How are we getting into this thing? Didn't I tell you? I RSVP to everything. Thank you. Fromage. Interesting. What do you think? It's quite clever. I took several classes at the École des Beaux-Arts. Modernism, post-modernism, the avant-garde. How productive. Well, well, you should know the tales of the life I've lived. Excuse me, where in France are you from? We're going to Cannes next year. Really? I thought we'd settled on Copenhagen. I am from Normandy. Normandy? Oui, yes. Have you... this painting here? No, I haven't. You see on the surface Adam and Eve in a disrupted Eden, is a familiar topic. But if you look at it, there is no depth, no soul, no character. It is nothing more than shock art. Wow, very insightful. What do you think of this painting? This one. Right there. This... This is... - I'm... - What? I am speechless. It's brilliant. Well, you should tell the artist. He's right behind you. Excuse me, this lovely Frenchman was just admiring the depth of your work. - Yes, your painting... - Do I know you from somewhere? Uh, no, no. I don't think we've ever met. It is you. You are the guy from the party. - No. - What are you... what are you putting on some kind of accent? No, you're mistaken. I am... My name is Pierre. Pierre Lumiere. No, I remember you, drunken ass. I remember the whole night. So what? You make fun of me in your native tongue, then you thought, hey, I want to track this guy down, put on some phony ass French accent and want to fuck with me again? Because I remember you droning on and on and on about your ex-wife, right? Stacey. How Stacey broke up with you. How Stacey won't return your calls, and how you're worried that Stacey's going to find some other cock, - and she's coming back... - It's Susan, okay? - Her name is Susan. - Susan? Sarah, Steve, who cares, huh? Then you mock me for being gay. What the fuck is that? - Maybe we should go. - What? Are you gonna give me shit about my work now too, - is that it? - No, no. - You're right about me. - Yeah. I am stuck in my head about my relationship and the whole fucking thing and the other night, I was a mess. I barely even remember what happened, but screw all that. Tonight's about you. It's about appreciating your work. It's impressive. I really like this, man. The texture, the weight of it, the simplicity... It's moving. You should be really proud. You are an incredible artist. I'm sorry for bothering you. Come on. Okay, what do you think? Does it look like I'm going to a funeral? Should I add like a pop of color or something more casual? Nick, I need your help, okay? Is this stunning or stupid? I still have time to take it back. It's black, right? It'll go along with the whole thing. Okay. Well, even if that's the case, could you just indulge me, please? Is this costume or couture? - Uh, isn't it bad luck for me to see you in the dress? - Nick, that's a wedding. - This whole thing sort of feels like a wedding. - What? Babe, you're having a ring ceremony, a cake, you're trying on a dress. The next thing I know you're going to be asking me to take you on some post-divorce honeymoon. Well, you know what? After all of this, it would be nice to have a little getaway. I was kind of surprised when you said you wanted to meet for a drink. Yeah, well, it's because I have to do something that I really hate. What do you mean? I got to give someone else credit. The other night, when you walked into my show. You really helped. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. - I thought I ruined everything. - No, not at all. You broke me out of my misery. You know, so here I was bitter because I wasn't in a relationship. And then you spot my work, and it speaks to you. Truly, speaks to you. When you shared that passion, it became infectious. I meant what I said. Yeah, well. Because of that, I sold my first painting. - You did? - Yeah, my first. - Good for you. - Thanks. I don't know, it just made me think, man. And who cares, my ex broke up with me, right? For the first time in a long time, I... felt like something more than his boyfriend. Sorry. Sorry, we're late. Jake didn't know his ass from his hand. Woah, woah, woah. I thought we told you no crashing. - What are you doing here? - No, relax, relax. I invited him. - You did? - Yeah. He's getting the first round. Right, Nate? We play our cards right, we close the bar down. Damn straight. I'm going to let my sorrows drown. Anybody needs to call home to get a hall pass? Uh, no, I'm newly single, so nobody is watching my ass. My wife loves when I go out so she can work on her novel. Really, you don't have to go home and grovel? I haven't had this much fun since... I don't know when. Keep hanging with us, you'll find your zen. Hey, I need one burger, one scotch, and one beer. What about a chardonnay from a stellar year. I know before hanging with you guys, I was a pathetic dude. But thanks to your help, I'm feeling renewed. Well, congratulations and welcome to your new life. Should come and help me get over my ex-wife. That sounds like a party with no remorse. Actually, I'm sending out invites to celebrate my divorce. Hello. Chapter 7 in the bridal bible, squeezing sublimely into the wedding dress. We need you toned and tight. I'd like to register for the beer mug set, the ping pong table and the 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV with crystal clear pure pixilation. If you can also throw in one of the mini fridges for the bedroom, I've kind of gotten used to it. Is this for a wedding? No, it's for a divorce. I have a challenge for you. A challenge for me? Like fixing you hasn't been enough. You have to say yes or no before hearing the question. - That seems a little unfair. - Oh, it's completely unfair. The odds are totally in my favor. What's it going to be? - I'm too tired for this. - Yes or no? Yes. Fine, okay. Now, can you end my misery and tell me what horrible thing I just agreed to? A night on the town with me. We'll consider it a practice date before I find a real date. Assuming you can even find someone willing to hang out with you. Well, I just did, didn't I? Look, I'm ready for something new. I mean look at me. This is Susan's idea of what I should look like. And for example, my hair, she made an appointment for me every fourth Saturday and every fourth Saturday, I would go. I get it, you're a blank canvas. - Exactly. - Yeah. I need your help. Okay, I'll make some calls and put you in touch with the right people, okay? Okay. I had no clue so many guys use lowlights to offset the highlights so that the hair looks darker and thicker. I never even thought to do anything with my face. I didn't exfoliate, I didn't moisturize. I just showered, shaved and maybe threw some chap stick on when my lips cracked. And when Susan and I shopped, we always bought clothes a little bigger so if I put on a few pounds, they'd still fit. What the hell happened to you? I take that as a compliment. Did you think of a name for your signature cocktail yet? I was thinking the Tyrannosaurus-ex. The he-devil. The obituary. You're such a cunning linguist. One dance. As your primary Svengali, I'm telling you this is taking it too far. - I insist. - I resist. I persist. - Nathaniel. - Katarina. Not bad for a first date. I think this poor group of divorcees would be proud. Well, I... I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I... I don't know. It's just so daring. - So you don't like it? - No. Nope. I love it. So what is it? - Don't take this the wrong way. - Okay. But I'm just surprised and shocked that something so smart, sophisticated and unique actually came from you. I'm sorry, did I do something? You guys are staring at me like I did something wrong. I mean, I know I skipped a few sessions, but what's going on here? I don't know about the other guys, but me personally, coming in here with new shoes, hip hair, like you're ready to conquer the world. It makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Are you serious? I'm just supposed to come here when I feel down and struggling and feeling miserable? Maybe. What are you guys saying? We're thinking maybe you don't belong in this group anymore. We think maybe you need to leave. He did look pretty good though. Hi. Uhm, hi, everyone. I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming to my little dress rehearsal. I wanna make sure that this goes off without a hitch. So without further ado, Nick. Excuse me, Nick, could you cue the music, please? Nick! Oh, you want it right now? Hi, guys. Hey. - Hi. - What are you doing here? You mind if we just talk privately? If you have something to say, you can just say it in front of everyone. Okay. I'm also having a divorce party. I miss you guys and I just wanted to extend the invite. I'd also really love to have you there, if you can make it. I mean that. I'm just gonna leave these here. I can't believe that just happened. Not to mention those weird clothes. Your clothes are weird. - No, they're not. - Yes, they are. You said I looked nice. Well, I lied. Hey, Muffin, these are great. I really like the... You can feel the letters. You know, it's got like the raised letters like little goosebumps on the paper. Did you still wanna play the song or... What is this? Did I miss something? Listen, I don't know. I... This started as a business arrangement. I signed on to plan your party and that was it. It didn't even cross my mind that I would actually start to soften or actually start to feel like I was missing who I used to be. But the closer I got to you, the more it reminded me of what Chuck and I used to be. And as much as it ended badly, that life was comforting and enticing. Of course, you're still going to have memories and feelings for who you used to be. But that's my problem, Nate. That life is addictive. It's all-consuming and I... If I'm not careful, I'll end up standing behind double pane windows holding a bun cake and commenting on how I really hope to get to Europe this summer. I understand. I understand what you're saying, but you can't just predetermine where two people are going to end up in a relationship. I mean, isn't it about the journey? And then there will be one night when you come back home and you look at me and you say, "I'm just not happy". And then where do we go? Good luck with the party. Well, I'm not going to sugarcoat bad news. Everybody loved your design for the concert hall, but you came in second. Something about it being too inventive, too creative and simply the best most original idea they ever saw. - Too creative? - What can I say? That's why I do mini-malls. - Hi. - Whoa! Hey. What... what are you doing here? Oh, I told the guy at the front desk I was your wife and he was so excited. He showed me the door and everything. - Have you've been working out? - You just barge in here while I'm naked? I don't get what the big deal is. I've seen you naked a thousand times. Well, the big deal is that we're kind of working through some issues at the moment. I don't know if you've got the right to see my nude body. Ouch. You're right and I have some things that I'd like to talk to you about. So, can I buy you dinner? Why would I let you buy me dinner? I could apologize. I could make excuses. But the truth is, I miss you. I miss us. We had a language, we had a way of communicating that belongs to us and I foolishly tried to recreate that with Nick. We didn't get each other. I wasn't in sync with him like I am with you. I miss that. And I'm willing to bet that you miss it too. There's a lot I miss. Thank you. So, what do you think? I don't know. What do you think? Well... I think we were together for five years. And it would be crazy not to give it another shot. Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you. I was told I could find you here. I know this is going to sound really weird but... I heard you help people with divorce parties. Who did you hear that from? A former member of our group. Yes, we thought he was emotionally unstable at the time but now, it seems like a pretty good idea. I'm sorry, that was just a one-time thing. Oh, that's too bad. He said you're a real artist. Sorry to bother you. Hi. - Shit. - What? I was still trying to figure out what the hell I was going say to you. Do you want me to give you another minute? Do you want me to close the door and come back out again? No, I'm fine. Moving out? What? Does the motel down the street have better rates? No, I'm getting back together with Susan. I'm going home. That's it? You're not going to say anything else? There's nothing more to say, Nate. I got to say, this is one of the things I really missed. I got to say I missed doing it for us. So, I was thinking for the party, maybe I can invite some of my friends. - Would they be new friends or... - Colin and Jake. You mean the Colin and Jake who bragged about sleeping with coeds? You know, it's probably not their kind of party. I'm not sure they'd even have fun. Yes, we should have them over another time. But you know what? It's up to you. Only do it if it's what you really want. Oh, I am getting my hair done tomorrow and I made you an appointment. They asked where you'd been and I told them traveling for work. Tell me it is not fucking true. - Of course, it's true. - How can you tell? His shoulders are slumped, his head is sagging and he's wearing that new cologne Defeated by Lane Jackoff. - What the hell are you guys talking about? - Remember that guy's wife who's in my fantasy league who also takes yoga with Jan? Did I hear that she got invited to a barbecue you and Susan are throwing? Why weren't we invited to that BBQ? - Okay, wait. - Unbelievable. - You got back together with her? - So there's no divorce party. I wanted to take you guys out to lunch and explain everything properly. Explain? What is there to explain? I'm trying to work things out with Susan at the moment. It's really complicated. Look man, divorce Susan, stay with Susan. Honestly, we don't care. It's really not that complicated. Guys. Hey, I am so glad you called because I left some things off the list this morning. I've decided to make potato salad instead of coleslaw. So can you please pick up - a pound of redskin potatoes, a bunch of chives and some mayo. - Yes, actually, you know what? That's perfect because I was thinking of inviting a friend of mine. - Oh, you are? - Yes, Chad. I met him through Colin and Jake. You're going to love him. This barbecue isn't really the environment for guys who chase coeds. No, trust me. He's the last person to be chasing co-eds around. Yes, we could do eight. Of course. Is he bringing a wife or a girlfriend? No, actually, he just broke up with his boyfriend, so we'll just be seven. You know, seven's like just an odd number and I don't want him to feel like a seventh wheel. Trust me, he's going to blend right in. I don't want to tell you you can't invite him, so if it's what you really want to do. I really do. Okay? Okay. Bye. I know what you mean. Nate and I have been trying to decide if we should get pregnant or if we should take one last trip to Paris. Nate, how's work stuff going? You know, honestly, I've been thinking about leaving. - Really? - Yeah, I actually entered this competition to design the new concert hall and it sort of got me thinking about striking out on my own. Well, you know how risky it is to go out on your own. I said to him, let's just make that a goal for the future - when we don't have a mortgage to pay every month. - Not to mention the distance, you know. It's like what happens if you get a job to do a building in - some other city like Omaha? - I hope not. I hate Omaha. Well, if you never take a leap, then things never change. You know there's plenty of room for an in-ground pool back here? Yes, I'm always saying that to these two. It could increase the property value 20% easily. Nate. You ever play the rhyme game? I played this in college and it was kind of lame. Hang on, I don't think our guests are interested in playing some unintelligible drinking game so they can get hammered. I'm drinking water, I wanna play. I think I'm enamored. Maybe it's time for a change of pace. So we don't spend the whole night treading in the same place. Exactly. It doesn't hurt to try something new. Unless you're scared to face yourself and what is true. Okay, play your stupid game, fine. Jane, can I have some more wine? We can sit here and eat chips all night. Feels like we're trying to force something that shouldn't be forced. Feels that way, doesn't it? I think I need to be on my own for a while. Take it from me, it's not gonna be as bad as you think. Okay? - You're resigning? - Yes, I need to. I mean, you believed in me and I thank you for that, but I always wanted my own firm. I know it's going to be tight, but I feel that now's the time to take a shot. Well, funny enough, you're already reaping the rewards. - What do you mean? - The city called. All that imagination and creativity that was way too much for the concert hall is perfect for the new skate park they just commissioned. Why don't you make that your very first official job for your new company? Are you serious? Hey, man. We just wanted to congratulate you. - Yeah, that design kicked ass. - Thanks, guys. Well, whenever you're free, I'm ready to down some Brewskis or tease some tail. Of course, you're both still invited to the party. - We wouldn't miss it. - Yeah, I wanna meet Katie. Yeah, well, unfortunately, she's the only one who hasn't RSVP-ed. I'm going to tell you the story about how I recently met someone remarkable. That person was pretty invisible for a long time. And with the help of someone special this invisible person was finally able to emerge and find his voice. - Looking good. - Ready for the first night of the rest of your life? - Yeah. - Well, let's get this party started. - You guys go in ahead. - You okay? - I just need a sec. - Okay. I forgot to RSVP. I thought you RSVP-ed to everything. I guess I've changed. Shall we, Ms. Franco? Certainly, Mr. Brown. Subtitles by explosiveskull
