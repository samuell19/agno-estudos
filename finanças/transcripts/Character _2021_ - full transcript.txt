You didn’t sleep again? What do you think of these? As always, your drawings are good. Let’s sleep for a while? It seems like the editor is only available to meet me at 5pm today. I see. Oh man... Please don't use the cup as an ashtray. Ah, I'm sorry. This editor Omura-san is an amazing hitmaker. Yup. I have to somehow get his recognition... This time. It'll be good if we can give our parents good news this weekend. Look at this page. I drew for 3 days. It's amazing. It's really amazing. The drawings are good. Are you an assistant of someone? With "Occult Hause"s Honjou-sensei. That's why you draw so well. Moreover, you drew using ink instead of digitally. Even sticking screentones... It's rare these days. Sensei has converted to digital, thus he no longer uses screentones and gave them to me. Have you received any rookie awards? I submitted to several magazines... and received Shortlisted and Excellence awards. Did you debut in any magazine? No... I always say this to those drawing horror or suspense genres. It's obvious that they have never committed murders in reality, and have never seen one, right? - Yes. - That's why it lacks reality. So, to be realistic... readers must at least find that characters appearing in your manga could exist in reality. However for your manga, the drawings are outstanding, but the characters lack personality. They are too common. You can consider adapting from other original works. But if you are unable to create the characters, it will never be a hit. Is it no good at all? Why don't you try harder and aim for more rookie awards? I'll make a move then. Hello. Ah, are you okay? It's fine by the way. For you to continue until you are satisfied. No, i have already decided that this is my last try. Are you really going to give it up? It's time to find a job. Well, I still can’t get you an expensive ring though. I'm sorry. It’s fine with me. So, Keigo... Okay bye, it's about time to head to the studio. If so, you can focus on being my assistant: I will continue to feed you. No... My dream was to become independent, so... I'll wash my hands of drawing manga. That's why, as i have told you previously... Please let me resign today. It is nearing 9.30pm. It is the time for Saturday Night Radio. Even though it is gradually getting colder, how is everyone spending their long autumn nights? It is November soon... Hey, can someone sketch a mansion for me? - A mansion? - You can find one in the vicinity, right? Ah, to draw Miiko's house? That's right. A house that seems to be filled with happiness no matter who looks at it. Eh, to find one now? - Can't it be tomorrow? - No, it has to be now. No no, but everyone has their hands full. Should I go then? Oh, Yama-chan, will you go? Yes, I have caused inconvenience to everyone so I will go. That's good. Counting on you. Yes. - Yamashiro-san, sorry to trouble you. - Don't worry about it. It's such a waste for Yama-chan to give up when his drawings are so good. About Yamashiro... Do you know why he keeps receiving rookie awards yet he can’t debut? Why? That guy... aims to draw a suspense manga but he can't draw a real villian. It is detrimental to his manga. That guy is Mr. Nice Guy, isn’t he? Mr. Nice Guy can't draw villians as he lacks the attribute himself. Excuse me. I'm not a suspicious person. Well... I am a manga assistant tasked to sketch a house... Excuse me, the music is too loud. Well, no, I am not from this household... But you were talking to someone from Funakoshi’s house just now, right? Could you tell them they are bothering us? Or I'll call the police. Please pardon me for entering your gate. Is anyone home? I come bearing complaints from your neighbour. = CHARACTER = - Ask the hospitals in Yokohama for the victims information. - Understood. - Hey, it's fine to enter now. - Got it. Please follow up on the rest. I'm entering now. The murder weapon? It should be a sharp knife but we have yet to locate it. I'll head back to work then. Head Makabe. Could i count on you to question the witness? A guy named Yamashiro Keigo. Understood, Deputy. Seida will join me. Seida? He is someone who is gifted at questioning and interrogation. He is able to narrow interpersonal distance quickly. You know... Is it true that despite being a street racer, that guy smoothly passed the entrance exam to be a prefectural police? No way... He even picked a fight with the Public Safety Commission not too long ago. Well, so be it. Just don’t let Seida go out of control. I am not out of control. My character is to be diligent and exert my utmost efforts, Deputy Okumura. Counting on you. Understood! - What were you guys talking about? - Nothing. It's about me, right? What's there to hide? It doesn’t matter. Let’s go. More importantly, I've told you to stop talking to me in this way in front of others. I'm your superior. I know it is irritating to be questioned so many times. But could you talk to me just one last time? Yes. Firstly, you are a manga artist's assistant... Who is he? It is Occult Hauser's Honjou Hayato-sensei. Occult? - Have you heard of it? - It's extremely popular. So, it was coincidental that you were sketching that house. But as someone who draws manga, why bother to stay there to sketch it? It's night time after all. Isn’t it better to take a photo? Honjou-sensei... Said that a house should also have a character. - What is this? I don't understand. - Hold on. Please continue. That... A house... Its aura is important. Whether it has a character or not...is important. It's so much work just to draw a manga. Even though i understand why you are committed to draw it, why did you enter their house? Their neighbour... said that the music was loud. I was thinking if he called the police, It might inconvenience Honjou-sensei. I called for them at the gate but... Then... I entered the living room... Well... Seeing such a scene will indeed cause you to panic. So, this is your sketch. I'll take a look. This is amazing. That is... Because... Honjou-sensei told me that my manga characters were weak, I habitually draw people who stand out from the crowd. You can draw to this extent from a glance? That's it! Since you are a manga assistant, you can draw the murderer’s composite sketch, right? Yamashiro-san, did you see the murderer’s face? I didn’t see it. Didn’t you say you saw a silhouette or something? I'll leave this here with us. Please excuse me. - Thank you for the hard work. - You too. I met Honjou. Yamashiro didn’t lie. He wasn’t at the scene during the estimated time of murder. I see. What is it? He's extremely suspicious. Are you okay? Did you get injured? That's good. The murderer didn't attack you. What happened to your clothes? I borrowed this. I see, What do you want to drink? Are you able to eat? No. Bow! At ease! I shall begin first. The case is highly abnormal this time. Therefore, the case details, especially on the condition of victim bodies must not be disclosed to the public. Next, Head Makabe. The victims are... Funakoshi Muneyuki, 53 years old. His wife Youko, 50 years old. His oldest son Takayuki, 20 years old. His oldest daughter Anri, 18 years old. Their cause of death was multiple stab wounds from a sharp knife, which took place between 6pm to 10pm on 24 October. The murder weapon has yet to be found. The quartet was tied to the chairs after they died, and positioned to be seated at the dining table. After the murder, it seems like the murderer remained at the scene and sat with them for a while. A psychotic guy... The murderer’s intention is unknown. Therefore, we will conduct investigations following both possibilities of thrill and revenge killings. Stay cautious! Henmi Atsushi, 50 years old. He killed a family of four when he was 16 years old. He was placed in a medical juvenile correctional facility for 12 years. Such a guy lived in the vicinity... I'll take a deep dive into him. Counting on you. - Alright, let's go. - Yes. Henmi Atsushi-san? Can we ask you a few questions? Aren’t you going to chase? You can chase If you want. If this is a drama, an ostentatious chase sequence would have started. Reality is modest. Henmi-san, why did you run away? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I did it. It was all done by me. Henmi-san. You admit to killing the Funakoshi family, right? Admit? Yes... It was me. Did you have an accomplice? Accomplice? No... What's your relationship with the Funakoshi family? I don’t know them. Are you really the one who killed them? Yes. It was me. Why did you do it? I couldn’t quite remember. It was probably because I couldn’t suppress myself. So you are saying that you committed the crime impulsively? Impulsively? Yes. Where is the murder weapon? I couldn’t quite remember as well. Head, looks like the case has been solved quickly. No, not yet. No matter how you see it, it was done by Henmi, right? Settle it quickly. I've already reported it to the 1st Division Chief. What do you think? Even though he admitted to doing so, he could neither remember his intention nor the circumstances that led to it. But the Deputy said the case had been solved and he should be sent over as soon as possible. What? That guy doesn’t even know the statement in detail. I don't want repeat myself. It's decided by our superior. Keigo, the murderer has been caught. The murderer. Kanagawa Prefectural Police has caught the suspect, Henmi Atsushi, 50 years old, who is unemployed and stays in Kanagawa Prefecture. After being questioned by the police, he admitted to the crime. After being questioned by the police, he admitted to the crime. Moreover, Suspect Henmi had killed a family of four in the past... and was placed in a correctional facility. The police said they would investigate him for possible links to other crimes. A breakdown? Are you okay? I'm not okay. Is that car breakdown yours? That's right. It's old. Have you called JAF? Can i hitch a ride? It's just further ahead. - Could you cram a bit at the back? - Hold on are you sure? He said it was just further ahead. Sure, you are welcome to hitch a ride if you don’t mind. Sorry that you have to cram because of me. Where are you planning to go to? It should be around this area. We're going to the guest house ahead though. Is it around there? Oh, it has become a guest house now. Are you planning to camp in the mountain? It's good. A family of four looks happy. Is that so? A family of three or five is also happy when it’s time to be happy. No no, a family of four is the best. A family of three or five isn't good. Could that be... "Rising Sun”? Yes. Do you know about “34" serialising in it? Yes, it is interesting. Doesn't the character Dagger The Serial Killer look like me? Yes, now that you mention it. Slash! Stab! Ahhh! It somehow makes him cool. Sir, I'm good to alight around this area. What? Here? But there's nothing around this area. No worries, this area is good. But... It's fine, isn’t it? He said so himself. That's mean, Madam. Could it be that you hate me? - Looks like more time is needed. - Yes. Are they 2nd Division’s Head Makabe and Seida? Why did they come to see our case? Hello. Why are you here? We are concerned about something. Could you let us take a quick look? I'm asking, why? A family of four was stabbed to death in the car, right? There are similar aspects with our previous case. The case where Henmi killed the Funakoshi family a year ago? - I'd like to take a look at the car interior. - Just a quick one. Could you let him take a quick look? Hey! Don't take photos without permission! Don't be agitated. I'll beat him up later. - How long more is he going to do this? - I'm sorry. I think it'll end soon. This is far from ending soon. Excuse me. This. Have you investigated this car roof interior? Car roof? Is it okay for me to search the interior? Please hold on. I'll take a photo first. Please go ahead. Found it. Wow, you're as instinctive as always. How do you know where the murder weapon was located? A manga? I don’t read mangas. Whatever. Just read it. San-juu-yon? "34" here is read as san-juu-shi, the same name as that popular novel. The protagonist is a detective, who meets two ex-classmates at a reunion gathering. One is a criminologist while the other is a psychic. The three of them chase after Dagger The Serial Killer who hunts families of four. All of them are 34 years old, thus it's called “34" What has this got to do with the case earlier? Just read it for now. All clear on the left. Yes, all clear. Hey... This murder method... There are more. Pass it to me. Here. Seriously. Who drew this? Yamashiro Keigo. The first eyewitness to the Funakoshi family case. And... the first case in this manga Is modelled after the Funakoshi family case. The subsequent case... is just like how the Harai family was murdered along the mountain road. What do you think? One would normally think it is a manga copycat killer or the author himself. There's one more possibility? The same murderer killed the Funakoshi and Harai families. Henmi is innocent, and the real murderer is someone else. That's impossible. You heard Henmi's confession. I heard It. He kept saying he did it without revealing further details. Are you trying to say his confession is fake? If what you said is true, this becomes complicated. I will go and meet Yamashiro Keigo. That's amazing. - But i haven't told the rest so keep it a secret. - A secret. This way. Take care of my stuff. This. I've asked the store to reserve it for me. Is it fine? Yes. It's fine. I was thinking of informing our parents. Well, I've already given them a call. I would like to inform them in-person. We haven’t been going back recently. Sure. Make time for it, okay? Hello. Coming. - I am home. - Please come in. So you are going to be a mother soon. Feel free to let me know if you face any problems. Yes, i will depend on you. They shouldn’t face any problems. This person is now rich. Aya. But... You know, it is challenging to keep it serialising. Is serialisation that challenging? Sort of... Keigo, did you lose weight again? That's right. I am the only one gaining weight. My face is puffy, isn’t it? Not at all. Keigo-kun, please take care of your health. Yes. He gets sick because he draws such a manga. Stop it. It is impolite. Didn’t you also say it was scary? Aya, it is same for me. Very scary. Well, it is hard to imagine a docile person like him is able to draw such a manga. But it is satisfying to be able to feed yourself by doing what you like. Yup. Our father bought up the books available sat the nearby bookstores. Oh yes, this photo. - A baby cot? - Yes, it is very stylish. Work. Excuse me. - Cute... - This is cute, right? Hello. I am Omura. Yamashiro-san, did you do something? What are you talking about? I am Omura. Yes, please come in. Please tell me already. What are you here for? Wel, well. This is amazing. Who is going to sit on sofas placed at such a place? Right, Seida? I understand. Let’s just be quiet. Sure. The security is also impeccable. Just how many times do you have to press the intercom? Three times. Even the residents can only access the floor they stay on. Rich people are highly cautious. He should be able to earn a lot from manga? Well, if it sells. Around how much? If he sells one million copies of a 500yen book, 10% goes to the author. And if he releases three to four books a year... A yearly income of over a hundred million? While there are many good mangas, very few sell well in reality. Yamashiro-san is the chosen one then. - Hello. - Hello. Please come in. Yamashiro has been expecting you. It is a beautiful house. You have good taste with the furniture too. - Thank you. - Do you like furniture? Yes. Well, I used to work at a furniture store. I see. You are no longer working now? Well, ever since Yamashiro started serialisation, he told me to stay home as far as possible. I see, His workplace is upstairs. Please go up from here. - Sorry for intruding. - Not at all. - Sorry for intruding. - Please watch your step. Thank you for the hard work. The two detectives are here. It has been a while, Yamashiro-san. Do you still remember me? Oh, are you the only one at your workplace? Don't you have assistants or something? Yamashiro-san draws digitally, so his assistants will send their work online. So, how can i help you? Are you aware of the murder of four members from the Harai family near Yamanashi and Kanagawa Prefectures? No. The victims were stabbed to death in a car along a mountain road. A car? I beg your pardon. Could you take a look at this photo? Isn’t it similar? And... Excuse me. This car roof interior... The kitchen knife was found here. Doesn’t it resemble what you have drawn in your manga? Hold on, are you saying Yamashiro-san is a suspect? That is not what I am saying. It could be a copycat killer. Do you have any possible persons in mind around you? No, I can’t think of anyone at all. Also, the murder case in the first chapter... It is modelled after the Funakoshi family case, right? You could actually draw it to this extent after that experience. Yamashiro-san is a manga author. Isn't it normal for him to treat the abnormal experience as a muse for his manga? What i am concerned about... is what took place in the next chapter. In this manga... The first eyewitness saw the murderer’s face. - I created that. - Who is the model for Dagger The Serial Killer? He is a character that I have created. An original creation. An original creation... Are you really not hiding anything? Yes. By the way, for the kitchen knife found in the car roof interior, where is the story going with this? Is it the weapon used to kill in the car? I have not decided on it yet. Have not decided? We will decide at a meeting after this. Can I return to work already? Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet us. We will make a move then. Goodbye. That's good. I understand. Thank you. Isn't it better if I stop serialisation? Even though a copycat killer has appeared, It has not reached this stage yet. Chief Editor has also said fer this manga to be our pillar. In the first place, isn't it selling well right now? Se, let’s continue to work hard. But.... Yamashiro-san, you were an assistant for a long time, and now your dream came to fruition. Isn’t it a waste to give it up? More importantly, the knife that was found in the car roof interior earlier, how should we handle it? After settling today's manuscript, i'll think about it when coming up with the next draft. Counting on you then. I will make a move first. Welcome. Oh, it's Sensei. Good evening. You don't look so well. I've been quite busy. It's tough to be a hot-selling manga artist. Is beer okay? Thank you for waiting. Isn’t it Yamashiro-san? Welcome. Are you tailing me? It's coincidental. - I want beer too. - Yes, certainly. I have nothing else to say. No, I have already ended work for today. Our questioning was harsh earlier, but I like “34". I mean it. There are parts that I can’t appreciate as a police, but your drawings are detailed, and I'm drawn to your perspective. - Thank you for waiting. - Thank you. But you are amazing. I'm not amazing. Because, don't you have above average talent and put in extra efforts? It's already tough to become a professional manga artist, yet you can sell this well. I simply adore manga. Adore? In manga, what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong. Isn't it a form of art that speaks the truth? Good will always triumph over evil. But... “34" is quite different. The horrifying depictions are popular. I have yet to give my contact number to you. If you remember anything, please contact me. I really have nothing else to say. Yamashiro-san, there is no end to murder cases. Even if the murderer is caught, those who are left behind are emotionally affected for the rest of their lives. That is why i seek the truth. This is my job. Whatever it is, please let me know if you remember anything. Could you give me a call first? It is troublesome to go through Omura-san to look for you. Yes, okay. I have saved it. Excuse me. Hello. You aren't investigating on your own, right? Of course not. I'm just drinking alone. You being the way you are, I thought that you were tailing Yamashiro. Go home soon. I know, I'm not a kid anymore. So you say, but how many times has it happened... Yes yes i hear you, Head. You are Yamashiro-sensei, right? Yes. I am reading “34" Thank you for your support. Can I shake your hand? Yes. I am Morozumi. I like “34" a lot. Dagger is like me, right? I understand Dagger’s feelings well. In other words, your feelings. It has to be a family of four after all. Which is the symbol of happiness. Well, even though there are families of four who don't get along. Thank you so much for drawing such a realistic and artistic manga for me. I have already actualised what you have drawn. But I am concerned about one thing. To liven up the plot, you left the knife in the car roof interior. You haven’t thought of what to do with it yet, right? I thought of a good story. Yamashiro? I don’t think he is the murderer. Just my instinct. He has an alibi too. But for him to be so guarded, there must be something. Are you okay? You really don't look so well. Is the person who was here a reqular customer? Who? I don't know who he is but your drawing is good as always. Give this to me. Oh, where Is Yamashiro-san? He just left. - He left? - Yes. Can i have the bill then? He already paid for you. - Excuse me. - Yes. I am a civil servant. This is bad. You're still awake? Your body is really going to suffer. Nevermind about that. Go ahead and sleep first. Are you okay? You're not having meals properly too. - What did you talk to the detectives about? - Nothing. I still think you should rest. I don’t have time to rest. No matter what happens, I must continue to draw. You don't know anything so don't lecture me irresponsibly. Head Seida. Forensics has shared the results of the knife in the car roof interior. To determine the DNA profile of the blood on it? Take a look. You'll be surprised. Is it the murder weapon of the Funakoshi family case? How do you know that? This is "Rising Sun" released today. You'll be more surprised. Exactly the same... What do you think of this? Excuse me. Division Chief. Head Makabe. Thank you for the hard work. We have concluded. After reporting to the Prosecutors' Office, we will immediately announce that Henmi is innocent. - Who wants a sausage? - Me! Me! Me! - Mama! - Hold on. Hold on, hold on. It is my fault for admitting to the crime. No one else is to be blamed. He has been saying that he has no memory of the crime, yet he has admitted to it. Our lawyer team will follow up on the possibility of the prefectural police and prosecutors coercing the statement from him. Henmi-san, how about the crime that you committed at 16 years old? I recalled that you also said that you had no memory of the crime, and ended up admitting to it. Was it wrongfully convicted too? 16 years old? I really can’t remember it too. But I should have committed it. Stop reading manga at a crime scene! Hello, Omura-san, I am Prefectural Police Seida. Yamashiro-san is not answering my calls. Are you able to contact him? I do not know either but he has just submitted the latest chapter. He could be drinking in a bar under the railway track. - Thank you for having us. - Thank you for the patronage as always. Was Yamashiro-san here? He previously treated me here. No, he has not been here recently. Is that Dagger? Dagger? A character in Yamashiro-san’s manga. I did not read 34. This was a portrait sketch of a person drawn quickly by Yamashiro-san. Portrait sketch? Of whom? It was someone who was sitting beside him. When was it? Oh? Wasn't it on the same day that you came? Sorry fer bothering you. It was sent later than usual so I brought it directly to you instead. This is the initial print and the latest issue to be released tomorrow. The editors were praising how the knife was foreshadowed in the story and revealed thereafter. Also, could we count on you for the covers and coloured pages for the next three issues? Sure, I don’t know when it will reach its end after all. We already said that it would not end. And regarding the movie... Sorry, I need to go out now. Please don't forget to schedule the next prenatal visit in the following week. Yes. Thank you. I'll make a move then. - Thank you. - Please take care. We haven't talked properly lately. It has been like this even since the serialisation. I said harsh things to you. Even though I understand that you are busy, please also take care of yourself. Yup. How about you? How is it? What are you referring to? Because i didn't accompany you to the hospital lately... so... Going well. - Is that so? - Yup. That's good. Do you really mean it? Of course. Keigo, do you prefer a boy or a girl? You already know the gender? I know. But I want to keep it a secret to surprise you. Aren’t you Yamashiro-sensei? I have read the latest issue. The knife part is so realistic that I find it interesting. Is he someone you know? Are you his wife? Yes, thank you for supporting my husband. I am Morozumi, who co-created “34". Like an adviser? He always uses my ideas. You have someone with such a role? Let's go. No, please... Why did you go to the hospital today? Are you feeling unwell? No. Are you pregnant? Yes, that is right. Kids are a symbol of happiness right? That is right. I see. That is why you bought a baby cot. Natsumi, let’s go. Please excuse us. What is with that person? Sorry, I will stop serialising “34". That guy is a serial killer. What are you talking about? I saw it. That night. The murderer's face. I made him into a character and drew the manga. He is Dagger. It’s okay. The police... I will tell the detective everything. I see... It finally makes sense. I am really sorry. Thank you. Why did you hide it? I don't know if you can understand my cirsumstances but I barely have any talent in drawing manga. I don’t want to admit it though. But when our eyes met, that guy became me, and I became him. An amazing character came into my mind for the first time in my life. But I am a normal person after all. I can take it no more. I have said this before, that I liked "34". I don't find that it is selling well just because that guy appeared in it. The murderer has the same face as Dagger right? Yes. That guy called himself Morozumi. But I don’t know anything else. Understood. We will definitely apprehend him. I am really very sorry. I will redeem myself. We can talk about your consequences later. Do think about your new manga in the meantime. I will make a move then. Sorry... for lying to you. I had an inkling that you were burdened by something. In the past, you would show the drafts to me once you finished them, right? I find your manga amazing. So, please don’t say that you have no talent. Seida-san also said that about you. Once I stop serialisation, we can no longer stay here. It's fine. It’s too spacious here. I have to explain to my father and the rest of the family too. Yup. Isn’t the decision to stop serialisation made too hastily? The murderer read 34 and actualised the murder scenes. This is a manga that should not be drawn anymore. You shouldn’t say it this way. There are so many readers supporting the manga. I beg of you. Please allow me to stop serialisation. How about you take a break instead? A break? It will be painful for our magazine to end such a hot-selling manga. I find that we should be responsible to the readers by ending it properly. So, please take a break, and see how things go. Yamashiro-sensei, don't you also want to end it properly? We are facing murder cases that none of us have dealt with before. To regain public confidence in us, we hope to capture the murderer as soon as possible. The case details should be placed on your desks. Serial murders of the Funakoshi family from a year ago, the Harai family from this year followed by the Sugimura family of four... Why are you stopping serialisation? Explain to me. I'm going to call for help. Go ahead and call. Whoever you call will die. I told the police everything. Including the day we first met. Your name too! Name? I cannot cover for a murderer. Don’t you kill people too? You enjoy killing people in the manga. How is that different from me? I didn't enjoy... Don't lie to me. You enjoy killing families of four. I would have caught up to the serialisation after one more murder. You should at least complete the final murder. Understood. I will check the bookstore’s CCTV system. Yamashiro-san, you should avoid going out if possible. Just think about the manga instead. Goodbye. Head Makabe! A deliveryman? A mansworking in a delivery service company in the west district. I have called to confirm that his name is Morozumi. Their van was near the Funakoshi home on the day of the murder.. He could be the one that we are looking for. Van? Yamashiro caught it in his sketch. Furukawa Express. Thank you for waiting. Here is Morozumi-kun’s resume. Morozumi Shuichi? ltabashi, Tokyo... ltabashi, Tokyo... We are going to take note of his address. Sure. I'm back. You want to stop serialisation, but I will continue. Sorry for dropping by without notice. We are the prefectural police. Is this the home of Morozumi Shuichi-san? Is this the home of Morozumi Shuichi-san? Did Shuichi do something? No no. Is Shuichi-san at home? I have not seen him for close to ten years. Do you know where he is staying or what he is doing now? Who knows? Creditors still look for him every now and then so he should be alive? I see. Why do you think that Shuichi-san has done something? Because he was a problematic kid in the past. What sort of problems? His legs are injured due to an accident. So, he was despondent, kept getting into trouble, and left home. Legs? Do you have a photo of shuichi-san? We would like to take a look. I'm sorry. I'm tired... We lost our lead. The real Morozumi likely used his identity as a mortgage to borrow money. In the first place, can Yamashiro's statement be trusted? How would you explain the murder weapon then? We have no choice but to trust him. It may be possible for you, but he lied to us during the previous interrogatin, so how can we trust him? Those who are lost can't help but take the less-travelled roads. Are you saying that you were like this in the past? The real culprit’s personality... In other words, his character. When we are unable to determine that, we should keep reinvestigating his murder scenes. A human’s actions will definitely reveal his personality. These were wise words from a previous superior whom I respect. Who... are you? [A community that envisions a utopian family of four as happiness exists at the prefectural border.] [Child abuse cases on the rise?!] I'm back. I did pretty well, Sensei. Yamashiro-san, why did you choose this place for the case? Kujyou Village was abandoned after 1989. Before that, there were 20 groups of families of four living there. - Families of four? - Yes. At the time, the community was like a cult that envisioned a family of four as one of the components to happiness. My wife always says this is done in bad taste, but I was interested in its literary murder cases. I went through several documents during serialisation. And I happened to see this. So I selected this mountain road as the place for the story. I changed the name of the signage though. There are countless similar mountain roads. You can't actualise the scene to this extent by just reading the manga. I find that Morozumi is familiar with the place and its surrounding areas. He came from this community then? It could be residual hate due to the dissolution of families of four. You have been a great help. Can I borrow this? Of course. Thank you. That is all for today... - Thank you for the drink. - You are welcome. I will make a move then. Seida-san. I am very sorry for causing so much trouble. Are you still drawing manga? No, I am not up for it yet. I look forward to it. Hello. Head Seida, where are you now? I just left Yamashiro-san’s house. That guy did it again! A family of four in Midori District. Where is the location? At Midori District Shinsugi Street 2-6. I'll head over now. Oh yes, there was a community near the Harai family crime scene who treated a family of four as one of the components to happiness. Community? Somehow... I feel that it's related to these cases. I see... Tell me the details when you're here. Quickly. Got it. What a waste. You have progressed to a good stage. Ouch... The eyewitness accounts are the same. - It is without a doubt committed by Henmi. - Yes. Does this mean that Henmi also killed the Funakoshi family? He may have an accomplice, nevertheless just capture Henmi first! Yes. Yamashiro-san, why are you here? We told you to stay home as it is dangerous outside. I will send you home then. We have determined that Henmi is the one. It is just about capturing him now. His death is a pity, but I also feel relieved for him. Do you really think that Henmi is the main culprit? We will need to capture the one who killed the Harai family, and determine his relationship to Henmi to conclude. Do you think that the other culprit Is the guy called Morozumi who has been bothering you? Yes. The lead special investigation division has decided to capture Henmi first no matter what... But no worries, we will continue to investigate Morozumi. Or, that guy might turn in his grave. Seida-san is... Because of me... It is a secret, but Seida was a street racer. Even though he was never caught, he was a delinquent when he was young. I used to question him many times when i was still in the juvenile division. A lot of things had happened to him, and his grandmother is his only relative left. Doesn't say nice things, but he is a responsible person. He has always been so. Because Seida-san has been so nice, I can’t imagine that he has such an upbringing. You can't judge a book by its cover. That is why the society is scary. Even guys like Henmi and Morozumi can still lead a normal life. Yamashiro-san, you should continue to draw manga. I honestly have no interest in it, but that guy really loved your manga a lot. He was your fan. He was looking forward to your new serialisation. We will do whatever we can. You should also do whatever you can. It is at least what Seida would have hoped for. Draw the last chapter? Yes, he isn't restarting serialisation but he'll draw the last chapter. Our sales are dropping. He's our saviour. But he requested 50 pages. When will it be ready? Well, he wants to draw on paper for the last chapter, so he hopes... we can wait till the end of next month. Then, I'll secure a double page spread in the next issue for the preview. Yes. Natsumi. Could you take a look at this? This... If this happens as it is, you... I've received it. A shocking last chapter. Thank you for the hard work. Whether it can be released or not, we'll leave it to you to decide. Have Yamashiro-san really left the decision to me? He said so, but please make sure it gets released. Well, I'll go through it now. I acknowledge the manga’s connection with the cases. But do you think the murderer will openly appear in front of us according to it? Is possible. This is clearly a trap! Don’t be dumb! I cant assign staff to you based on this. Please at least allow our team to head to Yamashiro's house. Don't you think this is totally unreasonable? I think so too! But... If it is Seida, he will make the same decision. I beg of you. Seida... "Now off the records..." "I am looking forward to it." "Don't push yourself. You're selling well enough. Don't get too absorned in it." "You draw too many murders. What if you become a murderer yourself, Brother?" I see. Didn't see that coming. Yamashiro-san. Isn't it too dangerous to use your real family as bait? If it is not real, he will not come. We are counting on you. I'm really sorry, for troubling you all. But well, this many police came here so we can't help but to trust them. Keigo-kun. Didn’t we say to let us know whenever you are in trouble? Thank you... Mother. In addition, I would like to apologise for my attitude so far. This will end everything. Henmi appeared at Block 13? - Where did Henmi go? - I don't think he entered the shop. The backup staff have been deployed, right? Understood. We are fine here. Counting on you to detail it in the report. Understood. We will contact you once we are done here. Counting on you. Hello? Sensei, could you be at your parents’ house? That's incorrect, right? Because your house doesn’t have a happy family of four. Your parents remarried, right? You and your sister are not related by blood. They have been trying their best but you are the only one who can't accept it, right? That is an ineffectual family of four, right? Don’t you also hate happy families of four? It is the same as me. No! Let's protect the story by only killing happy families of four. So i have chosen the real one. Real one? Morozumi! Hello!? Natsumi. What’s wrong? Is everything fine at your side? Are we a family of four? What? Just answer me! Yup, so you know. Did Aya-chan reveal it to you? That's right. I am pregnant with twins. It could be a boy and a girl. Natsumi, don’t hang up the phone. Makabe-san, Natsumi is in danger! Yamashiro-san! Everyone, please wait at the safe house. - Yes! - This way please. I've reached so I'm hanging up. Will head up now. - Here you go. - Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Long time no see. Sensei, stand up, stand up. Sensei, which room do you draw at? Amazing. So this is Sensei’s room. I'm fine... Sensei, switch this on. Sensei. Quickly. I'm fine. Run away when you find the chance to do so. I heard It. Don’t do it. I beg you! Morozumi! Run away! Natsumi! Natsumi! Sensei, there is no need to overreact. Humans don’t die from just this. Do you know how hard I have worked to-date? I need to use energy from about 2 days rest to kill. It is easy for you. You draw whatever you like without knowing my hard work! Don’t you have a word of gratitude towards me? I was wrong looking down on you. Kill me first. You read the last chapter, right? I should be the first one to die. I'll have you protect the story. This is jointly created by you and I. Understood. It is after all jointly created by us. - Open it! - Yes. - We will lead the way. - It's this way. Natsumi-san. Natsumi-san! Yamashiro-san. It's enough. Don’t do it. Yamashiro-san! No! - Let's lift her up then. - 1, 2, 3. We will send them to the nearest hospital. We will leave the interrogation to you. I understand. Thank you. . Body protector. From the looks of it, he has multiple stab wounds. That's right. Let’s move. The trial begins. Accused, please step forward. Please tell us your name. Please tell us your birthdate. Please tell us your domicile. It’s tough on your neck. Okay, this is better. Is it still painful? Yup. Excuse me. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Yamashiro-san, it's time to take your temperature. - Thank you. The Prosecutor present the following evidence to establish during the trial. Firstly, it is the Accused's personal history. He was born into an unusual community that envisioned families of four as one of the components to happiness. His education and employment history was unclear. He was not registered at birth and had no family register records. Thus, he bought a person’s records and lived as him. Seida. Even though the suspect who killed Head Seida is still at large, this incident was instigated by you, right? Yes. Why didn’t you do it yourself? Because it shouldn't be done by me. To create a manga, you must have assistants. Henmi? Henmi. Please tell us your relationship with Henmi Atsushi. I was his fan. [A family of four murdered Enigmatic 16 year old murderer caught. Admitted to murdering a family of four determined to have sexual sadism disorder.] But he became my fan thereafter. I'm sorry for cancelling such an expensive order. Our new house is not as spacious. Don't worry about it. Did they become bigger? That's right. They grow big so fast. They are adorable. Thank you for coming down today. Oh? Did Natsumi-san head back? Who do you think you should be judged as? I will ask you instead. Who... am I?
