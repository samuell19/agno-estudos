Shinogara can no longer afford to let us butcher each other. We're ready to talk. We'd like to reconcile things. On behalf of the main faction, I invite you to return to our headquarters at Mount Fuji. This ends the message. Has Shiori-chan heard this yet? Yes, sir. She heard it last night, right after she arrived. Ikkaku-sama, it has to be a trap! They just destroyed Nansou! Why would they need to negotiate now? Ikkaku-sama, all of Northern Kantou has followed your orders. We've kept silent, but now it's finally time for action! Ikkaku-sama, we must have a decision! We believe it's finally time to defeat Genbu. The Kantou faction awaits your orders. Just give the word, and we'll rise up in battle! Don't be an idiot! How could Northern Kantou possibly beat all of Shinogara? B-But... The six warriors of Shinogara are responsible for this situation. Shinogara splitting in two has resulted in friends killing friends. If the main faction is truly willing to negotiate, I'll be happy to listen. What? You don't actually believe them, do you?! That's right! Genbu is only luring you to your death! Please reconsider this, Ikkaku-sama! I order you guys to stay out of this, no matter what happens. Ikkaku-sama! Ikkaku-san... Take me with you. I can't. If I brought you with me, you'd have to call upon Hayate's spirit. If you call him again, he may possess your body forever. Stay here and take care of Shuri. If anything happens to me... I'll need you here to protect Shuri and my men. Please, Hayate. Ikkaku-san.

Very well done. With Nansou destroyed, we have nothing to fear from Ikkaku and his Kantou faction. Don't you agree, Genbu? Yes, sir. By the way, I haven't seen Miyabi around here lately. Where is she? I expect that she's resting, following her battle. I see. I wanted to thank her for a job well done, but she deserves her rest. Ah, delicious. You know, I couldn't believe it when our leader was killed by Hayate, his own son. Now I realize that it was my greatest opportunity. This entire country is now mine to control. What are you doing? Genbu! Why are you just sitting there? G-Genbu?! Genbu, what are you going to do with him? Now, don't be hasty. He still has one more job to do for us. One more job? Exactly. Genbu-sama! Date Ikkaku has arrived. Have you prepared the Southern Hall? Yes, sir. Shinogara's forces are gathered there, awaiting your arrival. Very well. Lead Ikkaku-dono to the Southern Hall. I will join you shortly. Meanwhile, show him every courtesy. Yes, sir. You have my word. You are most welcome, Ikkaku-dono. Hm. Long time no see, Genbu. What's behind this change of heart? Shuri-sama! Don't! Shuri-sama, you need to rest! Be quiet. I'll kill him, even if it costs me my life! The assassination of our leader threw Shinogara into civil war. But we have finally solved that crime, and we have a new choice to make. We have finally uncovered the corruption in the ranks! Damn it! Let me go! G-Genbu! Wh-What's the meaning of this? Ranotei was once our leader's chief adviser. However, he learned an interesting fact. If the true successor, Hayate-dono, were removed, he, Ranotei, would be next in line. Ranotei testified that Hayate-dono killed our leader in order to seize the leadership of Shinogara. Why did we fail to realize it back then? The true traitor was never Hayate-dono, but this man! You planned this all along. Perish, you insolent fool! What are you doing? You can't do this. S-Stop it! No! G-Gen... He destroyed Nansou and took the Shadow Council for his own. He nearly controlled this entire nation! This wicked plot has been stopped! It is time to reunite Shinogara! To that end, we must choose a new man to lead us. And I can think of no man more qualified than Date Ikkaku-dono. Why, you ask? Throughout this crisis, only Ikkaku-dono has remained calm. He's the only one who acted for the greater good of Shinogara. That's a good one, Genbu. Me as the leader? Do you think that I, Date Ikkaku, will participate in this farce?! Wait! I see. This explains a lot. Everyone here is under your complete control. Too right. Are you that anxious to waste your men's lives? No, but Ranotei wasn't behind our leader's murder. I'm here tonight to execute the real ringleader of that conspiracy. Genbu! I'll have your head for this! I'll take care of him! Get back to the main building! Wait, Genbu! Get lost, small fry! Why are we here? What have I been doing? What- What's been going on?! Move aside, Miyabi! I'm going to kill him. Ikkaku, I won't let you kill him! You will fight for me now... as you did once before. Genbu, let's settle this. Kanuma Hayate. So you managed to save yourself. Will you agree to join me? Genbu, do you think you can make a fool of me twice? I won't let you get away with this! What a shame. And I spent so much time healing your body. If you return to this body, you and your sister can both live. Don't give me that crap! I don't believe you could hurt your own body. Go ahead. Try it. What's wrong? Dammit! You can't do it, can you? No, you can't, Brother! D-Damn! Brother, I'm sorry! Shiori, calm down. Don't fall for his trap! It's no use. You're not in your right mind. You wanted to control Shinogara, so you took control of my mind. And then, you forced me to kill my own father. Even if it costs me my life, I will destroy you! You still don't understand. Why are you so surprised? You still don't get it. Allow me to explain it for you. This Shadow Armor was made to protect your body, Hayate. It will be far stronger on your original body than the one you've reincarnated into. You've just lost the battle, Hayate. Miyabi! Don't you understand? He's just using you! Shut up! You don't know what it's like! Miyabi, why? If you pull your punches too much, you're going to die here. Miyabi! Wake up! He's using you! He's the only one who knows how I feel! He's the only one who understands my suffering! Our leader didn't kill your father! The problem is the evil within Shinogara itself! You're forcing your followers to make that same sacrifice! I'll kill anyone who opposes him. It pains me, Ikkaku... but that includes you! Having problems, Hayate? Hayate! F-Father... Sacrifice yourself. To preserve this nation, you must abandon the life you've known. I don't want to die. Save me! What good have we done for this country? No! Save me! The leader is killing us! He's a demon! A demon! Kill the Leader. Kill the Leader! Hayate, is that you? I cannot allow you to continue like this. It's you, Genbu. Leader! What's wrong, Leader? S-Someone, come quickly! Hayate-dono has killed his father! Die, Ikkaku! Miyabi! You should be dead! This is the end, Miyabi. I've come to take you to hell. I've lost control of my Shadow Armor's energy. If you fight me, we'll both die. I can't use my Shadow Armor's power in this cave. This area is permeated with magnetic monopoles. The resulting explosion will obliterate all of us. But I won't die alone! Don't, Shuri! Ikkaku, drop your Shadow Armor, or you'll be killed. Miyabi! Drop your Shadow Armor! Genbu... Ikkaku, take care of my people! Miyabi! Now you die! Genbu can control anyone once his armor touches their shadow. To kill him, I have to destroy the body he's controlling. I have to do it now! Hayate used the Infernal Spirits technique. The destructive power turned the cavern into a sea of flames. We've destroyed Shinogara. Our fight is finally over. I will probably never appear again. Farewell... Ikkaku... Shiori.
