I may be smiling but I'm not happy I may be crying but I'm not weak A, HOT GIRL LY COCO IS BACK! Nobody understands women WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I MISS YOU SO MUCH Don't think You'll ever have us figured out Hello, everyone! SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL JUST LIKE HER VOICE! LY, WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN TO SCHOOL RECENTLY? What are you doing, Ly? Sorry, folks. That's my roommate, her name is... I'm Huyen. I'm Ly's manager. If you want to get to Ly, you'll have to go through me first. Somebody is asking... What if I want to introduce a boyfriend? Of course, I'd have to check him out first. If he turns out to be a good catch... I'll keep him for myself! Oh no! I'm late for class. Bye, everyone, we'll livestream again tonight. I'm going to class with you today. Wow. Livestreaming and going to class? So you're done moping over your broken heart? It's been two months already. There's no use sitting around crying. My dad would kill me if he knew I skipped out on school. So have you been able to reach Phuong? Her phone is still off. What are you doing? Water's shut off. You didn't pay the bill did you? Here's the water bill. Don't tell me you didn't pay the electricity bill either. Where's the electricity money? Are you done admiring yourself? It's so sad, I've been trying to find a bad angle but there isn't one. Hey Ly, have you heard? How was Phuong the last time you saw her? Damn, it was just a sex clip. Why kill yourself over that? SINGER LAM PHUONG DIED OF SUICIDE AT AGE 25 Ly, where are you going? The body of singer Lam Phuong was found last night in her home. Preliminary investigations point to suicide, just days after a sexually graphic video of her was leaked on social media, leading to a wave of boycott from fans. The clip going viral also shows three other men with Phuong but none of them have been identified. As the only heir to Alpha Group corporation, Lam Phuong did not follow her father's footsteps, but instead chose the music industry and found her own success. Her educational and family background, as well as a private life free of scandal, had vaulted her into being the princess of the music industry, which was why the leaked video came as a shock to many. Moreover, the discovery of a Kumanthong doll at the scene of her death has spread rumors of voodoo and superstition. Dad! Why are you not at school? I miss you. Oh, please. You should quit drinking. Don't change the subject. Be honest. Some boy break your heart? Good grief, no! Are you pregnant? What are you on about? I'm just worried, that's all. Study well and find a good job, don't be like your good-for-nothing mother. All that singing and fame nonsense got to her head and ruined her life. What's wrong with singing? Everything's wrong with singing! The way those damn singers dress, they might as well be naked. Just a bunch of drug addicts! Yes, Dad. - Hello. - Are you looking for someone? Is this the home of Nguyen Mai Ly? Yes, I'm her father. I'm Detective Manh. We need to ask Ly some questions about Lam Phuong's suicide. Your daughter was a back-up singer for Lam Phuong. Is that true? Yes. Please calm down. I told you a thousand times, there would be none of that singing bullshit in this house! We just need her help in our investigation. You can come with us if you want. Get her out of my sight. The clip seems to have been recorded at a party. What do you know about it? I don't know anything. I was just her back-up singer. But Khanh, her manager, said otherwise. According to one of Phuong's text messages, you went to the party with her. Phuong's suicide note: who's "all of you"? Recognize this? Yuki. Phuong's doll. She loved it. It was her guardian angel. Not a very reliable guardian angel then. Didn't seem to help you either. You have one too. And they look like they were bought from the same place. No, that's not true. I bought mine at the market. Kumanthong dolls, they all look similar. I may be smiling but I'm not happy Cash up front, that's why everyone loves working with this team. Phuong's new album is coming out soon. Try to make rehearsals, okay? Yeah, I know. Khanh, you gave me extra. Phuong asked me to. Time to pay rent, right? I work the same as everyone else, so I shouldn't receive more. I feel awkward. No need to feel bad. You two are like sisters. So? What did you think about my performance? Same as usual. Same as usual? Not ground breaking? Not mesmerizing? No, what I meant is your usual is already the best. Because I have the best manager! And, of course, my little Yuki! I think ever since you got Yuki, you've had non-stop hits. Be careful, someone may get jealous. Sure, Yuki handles all the bookings, right? Yuki schedules the band, Yuki places the ads, Yuki butters up the reporters too. See? I adore Yuki but I love you. Let's go, I'm starving. Go get changed while I get the car. - Hey, Ly! - Yes? Your birthday's coming up, right? - What's this? - Open it. I love it. Thank you. Take care of her, she'll bring you good luck. I will. Ly, if you don't tell us what you know, I'm afraid more people will get hurt. Phuong, let's update story. - Have you applied a filter? - Of course. Now pose! What happened? There's blood... in the bathroom. Are you okay? There's no blood. Rest in peace... Phuong. - Are you Ly? - Yes. I'm Phuong's dad. The police met with me. I know you were there with her at that party. You told them you don't remember anything about that night. We were drugged, I really can't remember anything. Tell me the truth, did they threaten you? It's over, I just want to move on. I think Phuong would want the same too. Don't you want them to get punished? - I said everything I needed to say. - Nothing but lies! Look at Phuong. She was only 25, successful and talented... why would she dabble in drugs and those kind of parties? I don't think you know everything about her. She wasn't as strong as she looked. She kept a Kumanthong doll because she yearned for a mother's love. What did you say? Her mother left when she was very young, right? Shut up! You don't know anything about our family. I'm a victim too. I'm in pain too. I'm sorry, I have to go. You have to help me, you have to help me clear her name. I'm sorry. Hello? You have fun talking to Mr. NgÂºc? Who is this? If you don't want to end up like Phuong, watch your mouth. We're following you. SIX MONTHS LATER ACOUSTIC COMPETITION Look here. You have to show off a little more like this to get an audience. Unlike you. No, thanks. Try it. Who knows, maybe you'll get a million views! Leave her alone. Ly can actually sing, she doesn't need tricks. No need to strip if you got the gifts. Hey that almost rhymes. You should be a rapper. There's that singing contest that's been running ads like crazy. Yeah, I only have a few hundred friends and their ads still pop up on my page. Yeah. Here it is. The finals will livestream on YouTube. Sounds like a big deal. Ly can win this easily. Yeah, you'll be so famous if you win. Give me some of that reward money so I can pay the bills. SING FOR YOU COMPETITION You're so going to win. For sure. And the winner is... Tram Anh! Please come up to the stage, Tram Anh. Will our sponsors please join us on stage. Congratulations to our winner. Hey, did she bribe somebody? Her voice isn't even suitable for busking on the street. Oh, well... that's my life. You did very well. Thank you. If it were up to me, you would have been the winner. Can we change the rules of the game? There should be a second prize or consolation prize. Have some self-respect, would you? Water's been off for three days now. I need to shower real bad. What's her name? Little Ly. Wow. Yeah! - Look at this. - Please, enjoy. Can't remember the last time we got to eat this well! Can I have the cash equivalent of this meal? Shush! Eat and stop talking. Where did you summon Little Ly? What do you mean? I got her as a birthday gift. And did you do the summoning? What summoning? You kids really don't know anything. For Kumanthong dolls, you have to go to the right master. He will decide who's most suitable for you and bless the doll. If you don't do it right, it will backfire on you. I've never really thought about that. You know Lam Phuong the singer? Her voice was just so-so, so why did she become an idol? Because of Kumanthong. But Kumanthong didn't protect her, did it? You have to understand, the doll is just the shell. What's most important is the soul of the baby inside. How you treat it decides how your life turns out. You were the best singer tonight, you lost to the winner by only two votes. I think you have the look, you have the voice. But I've never heard of you before tonight, which means your doll is not working right now. My master, he comes to Vietnam every month. Look. Ask him to summon a doll for you. It'll be the best investment of your life. Just think about it and let me know. I'll show you the real master. There are all kinds of charlatans out there. Okay. Mrs. Tam is right. Little Ly is cute, but she's never been blessed. Ever since I got her, all I've had is bad luck. No job, no boyfriend. You're nuts. I'm this good looking and I still don't have a boyfriend! Mrs. Tam said ever since she got the Kumanthong, everything worked out for her. Don't be stupid! She's always been crazy rich. And you'll be famous in no time. You don't need any guardian angels... you have one right next to you. That's me! This is going to be the best investment of my life. When I'm rich and famous, I will supply you with a lifetime of sushi and boba tea. Nah. I'm just a ramen kind of girl. How about a year supply of Vifon ramen? Cheers. Whoa! Why so many dolls? Looks more like the Nguyen dynasty. They're pretty cute. Oh, please. Barbies are cute. These look more like descendants of Annabelle. Shush. Be serious. I'm being dead serious. Why does she look like Yuki? Who? Yuki, Phuong's doll. The accessories, the aura. Exactly the same. Aura of a doll? I'm going to call you Na. I'm going to be your mommy from now on. I'm going to love you like my own flesh and blood. So cute. Yeah, cute. Hey. That looks like Khanh. Khanh who? Khanh the producer, Phuong's boyfriend. The one you had a crush on? Keep it down. Don't get your panties in a twist. Shit. He saw us. Hey, Khanh! Ly's hiding right behind me! You! Ly. Long time no see. I'm Huyen, her manager. What have you been up to? Me? I'm still going to school. My office just moved to District 1, stop by some time if you want. I have a few projects coming up. We'll definitely be there. Make sure you line up the reporters, we can only spare five minutes. I'll roll out the red carpet for you both. Bye. Goodbye. Why did he give me this? What? He didn't have to. Why did he suddenly invite me to sing for him? Oh, that's just chit chat. You'll audition and he'll say, "Oh you're very good but oh, I'm so sorry." Then he'll make you a back-up singer. He's in need of back-up singers, you know. That's not what I meant. In a city this big, how could we run into each other by chance? It's good luck, don't you see? What the hell? I'm serious. He never paid any attention to me before. It must be for my baby Na. He looked at me differently today. It's two a.m. at the intersection We sit side by side watching the city There is a storm inside me You ask me what you should do When the one you love is gone Stealing your heart without a word Why can't you see? Day by day, the one next to you Can't make you feel the way I do Why are you in such a hurry? I am the one who loves you Your vocal range is impressive. It's hard to believe you didn't have any professional training. I've loved singing since I was a kid. My mom used to be a singer, just a bar singer, but she was very good, and very pretty. Why didn't you go to music school? My mom left my dad when I was young. She was so into singing that she followed the other man. If he knew I was involved with singing, he would be so mad. After Phuong passed away, the company slowed down too. I still can't believe it. She was my idol. You just lost an idol. I lost a fiancÃ©e, a soulmate, a partner, the future of our company. Khanh, you're the best producer in town, you can build it up again. We're drinking in the middle of the day? Just one glass. To celebrate our company's new talent. Are you serious? Very serious. We're going to make you a star in no time. This will be your new home. This is Ms. Nam, she'll take care of things around the house. I hope you like it. Thank you! Baby Na. Thank you for bringing me all these great opportunities. I know you listened to all my prayers. I promise to love you and take care of you forever. I love you too, Mommy. Hello, kids. - Hi. - Hello, auntie! I mean, hello sis! We just got started. Come on in. Okay. Hi, everyone. This is baby Na and her mommy, Mai Ly, our newest members. Baby Na! Say hi to all the aunties and uncles. Hi, Na. Happy birthday to Phuc. This is lovely. Phuc is saying thank you to auntie Ly. Phuc, say hi to Na. Hi Na! Look at that. There. You can now take pictures or videos if you want. Hey, you. You just told me I could take pictures. Just go do your thing. Go. - Hey, sis. - Yes? Can I ask you something? Sure. I'm just curious, when I pray to Na, can you ask for anything? Are there any limits? What do you want to wish for? Career, fame. Yes. Fortune. Love. What's so funny? Someone's in love! Why aren't you eating? You keep staring at me. It's so cozy here. Phuong used to love this place. You don't like the food? No, it's... wonderful. Ly? Are you all right? I'm fine. Thank you. Ly? I'm sorry. It's okay. KHANH Phuong used to love this place. This must be the nicest studio in the city. You know that Khanh built this studio for Phuong, right? She recorded all her songs exactly where you are standing right now. Are you ready? Let's get started. Yeah, okay. Phuong left so suddenly. Recently, she's been appearing to me. I'm scared. I never wanted to hurt her. I loved her. Don't worry, Mommy. She's not upset with you. You're like her little sister. You're really good for someone who's untrained. Thank you. Is it difficult to learn the piano? Sure, but someone like you could probably learn faster than others. Sit down. The white keys are the natural notes of each octave, the black keys are half tones. During the time of Mozart, it was the opposite. I didn't know that. Yes. Some things that are white used to be black and black used to be white. Just like human nature. You can't tell until you watch very closely. Focus. Play that melody again. Phuong used to like this song. Do you know its name? - I... - "Ah, vous dirai-je, maman." Mozart's variation. Then they turned it into a children's song, and the original title meant "Mother, if I could tell you." What would Phuong say to her mother? Khanh. I'm an addict... and a whore? Wow, I love it, thank you. Take good care of her and she'll bring you good luck. I will. Cuong, did you call for me? Hello, Ly Coco! Have a drink! I have class tomorrow. If you can't drink with me, how about with him? Hello, Ly Coco. I've been listening to you on Instagram, finally got a chance to hear you live. Thien, what a surprise to see you here. He's known as the star maker. You get to sing a song of his and you'll be famous overnight. I don't know what to say. Then you don't have to say anything, just have a drink. Here you go. Cheers. Look at you. Your voice still needs some polish but on certain notes, you're even better than Phuong. Come on, I'm just her back-up singer. Mariah Carey, Pink, Cher, Gwen Stefani. What do they all have in common? They all used to be back-up singers before they became stars. All you need is one hit song. I have a few new songs that I haven't sold. They might fit your voice. If you want, come over to Cuong's next week to try out, we're throwing a party. This is a huge opportunity, how could I? Opportunities only come to those who truly deserve them. You can ask Phuong to come with you. Things will be much easier for you if Phuong is there. Drink up. Cuong is throwing a party this weekend, you should come with me. You keep hanging out with those guys, they'll chew you up and spit you out one day. Cuong is a nice guy, and I like Thien's music. Nobody gives you things for free. You have your dad's support, and Khanh to take care of everything. Things are much easier for you. Me, I have nobody. If you're busy, I can go by myself. It's alright, I'll come with you. Really? But you have to do what I say when we're there. Ly? Sorry, I just wanted to drop off a few contracts for you. - Just leave them there. - Okay. I'm going now. Baby Na. Khanh looks normal on the outside but I think he's actually sad and lonely deep down inside. Only I can help him. You have to be there for him, and one day he'll love you. You called me? Come in, Ly. Hey, I just wanted to apologize for hugging you the other day. I think... What do you think? - Well... I'm embarrassed. - What? I couldn't help myself. I was scared. No, I'm talking about the song. How is it? Have a seat. It sounds familiar. Don't make me wait. Stay with me tonight. What? What's a better title? "Don't make me wait" or "Stay with me tonight," which title do you like? Oh... "Don't make me wait" sounds trendier. Okay, the singer has spoken! - Ly! - Yes? Will you sing this song? But you wrote this one for Phuong. I've adjusted it to suit you better. Are you sure? I'm certain that only Mai Ly can replace Lam Phuong. MAI LY DON'T PLAY WITH FIRE Khanh has been so nice to me. He's texting me all the time, and picking me up and dropping me off everywhere. I love you the most. Huyen, you can head home first. Why? I'm going with Khanh for a nightcap. Be careful, don't get caught in scandals before you're even famous. I know, but I love him. His fiancÃ©e passed away like six months ago and he's already all over you. You might just be a rebound, some temporary replacement, but it's certainly not real love. Shut up. You're just jealous. What did you say? Khanh. Babe! What's wrong? I... I'm fine. Ly, did I do anything to upset you last night? It's just that I haven't been with anyone in a while so I'm not completely comfortable. I won't force you into anything if you're not ready. I'm going to protect you. But do you love me? I never thought I could feel this way again. But to be honest, sometimes... I don't think I'm ready to love again. Phuong was my whole world. After the clip came out, Phuong didn't say anything to me. I felt betrayed. I felt like a fool. Maybe it was difficult for Phuong to open up. You two were very close. At the party, did she say anything to you? She just asked me to come with her, I didn't know anything else. Hi, Ly Coco. This is my friend Cuong. It's such an honor to have you here. Ly is the guest tonight, I'm just tagging along. Let me show you in. I heard you had an offer for Ly? Business talk already? Have a little fun. We're recording a new album soon so we can't drink. Otherwise, we'd outdrink all of you! I have a new song, which I think would be perfect for a duet with you and Ly. How's your production schedule? Can I squeeze my song in? I have to check with Khanh first. Do you have a demo? Of course! Wow, it's cool. It's going to be a hit. So, you see how nice we are to Ly Coco? I'm going to wait for Khanh to come back, and if he's okay, we can all have a drink together. Then just one glass for now. Go on. Let's drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm going to stop by the studio, I'll pick you up later. Okay. - Yes? - Flower delivery. Can you come to the lobby to sign for it? I'll be right down. WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY Are you Nguyen Mai Ly? Who's the sender? I have no idea. I was just told to deliver it here for you. This must be some mistake. I'm sorry. How can it be a mistake? It's your face! WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR NUMBER? WANT TO PARTY WITH US AGAIN? OR DO YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE PHUONG? Cuong, I'm telling you one last time, I'm not afraid of you. I'm not that kind of girl. Don't try to threaten me. It won't work! Phuong, they just called me too. The hell with them! But they said this was the last warning. If we don't come, they will... They've been threatening me for two months now. These bastards don't have the guts to do anything. There's an ancient proverb: "Inner beauty outweighs beauty on the outside." But I don't see anything wrong with looking beautiful. Tell you a secret... I've got both! My dear sisters, true beauty comes from within. Your confidence, your take-charge attitude are your best accessories. But don't forget this, pretty girls always get the guys. This is Phuong, it's her. What is it? - Sex clip? - Oh, that's bad. Is that true? Khanh. Phuong, can you explain all of this? Phuong. Phuong. Lam Phuong. A lot of people are questioning your lifestyle! You go to these events often? Who are those men? I don't know. I was drugged. I am a victim. Go! Lam Phuong. SEX CLIP OF SINGER LAM PHUONG ANGRY BACKLASH FOR LAM PHUONG SHE'S HIGH LIKE A DRUG-ADDICT! HER SINGING IS BULLSHIT! WHAT ABUSE? SHE LOVED IT! SERVES HER RIGHT! WHAT AN INNOCENT COVER! HAPPY NOW? GO TO HELL! DIE! These people are dangerous. I'm going to die if I don't do something. What you need, Na can't give to you. It's very difficult. I'm going to die. Please, you have to help me. Fetus... Fetus? You can't find this in Vietnam. Have to bring it in from Thailand. And even over there it's illegal. - Hello, sister. - Hi. Welcome, master. Baby Na needs to be cleansed from within in order to receive a new soul, that of the sacred demon spawn. The dark liquid is made of gold dust and dirt from Napran temple, allowing the new soul to enter. The demon infant is led through the gateway of the soul, at this time baby Na is in her weakest state. The enchanted knife makes sure that only the right person can lead other spirits through the gateway of the soul. Roc-sam-long... this is the tamed demon infant, called upon by the shaman. Sam-sat-yam ritual is to connect you to both Na and Roc-sam-long, to insure these infant souls will do as you command. Baby Na, if you love Mommy... please protect me from these bad people, please don't let them hurt me. You have to save me. I'm so scared. They threatened my life! It's all because I was hungry for fame, and I was a coward. Now I'm just a puppet in the hands of these bastards! Can you save me, baby Na? Nguyen Vinh Cuong, son of a real estate tycoon. He has a history of drug abuse. A staged death. Some sort of gang war? No, this looks more like personal revenge. I have bad news for our superstar! Why does your place feel so morbid? So? What's the bad news? You just got suspended from school for skipping class too much. That's not bad news. You rushed me for this? My hair is still wet. Come wait upstairs. What are you doing? Why do you have a dead man's photo? What do you mean? Didn't you read the news? How do you know him? Why? Why did he die? Who is he? The party. He's the one who invited me and Phuong. He drugged us. He raped us and recorded the whole thing! They wanted Phuong to become their slave. He released the video when Phuong refused to do what he wanted. And now it's my turn. Why didn't you tell me? So all those months, you lied about being depressed from a break up. I was a nobody back then, so they didn't bother me. But it's different now. I'm scared. I don't want to lose everything, like Phuong. And his death had nothing to do with you, right? No, I was just asking for protection, I didn't mean anything! Baby Na killed him to protect me. You're out of your mind. You have to get rid of this thing! Don't touch my baby! She's just protecting me. This is voodoo! It's evil! You get that, right? This doll is messing up your head, you have to tear down this room! Or there'll be consequences. Leave me alone. Go away. Ly, someone just died. This is no joke! Are you done? Just get out! SON OF RICH LAND DEALER FOUND DEAD I thought I would get exactly what I asked for. I asked Kumanthong for protection, not murder. But now he's dead, he can't hurt you anymore. Isn't that what you wanted? I want to return baby Na. You young people are so ungrateful. You're selfish and superficial. You think anything can be bought, used up and returned whenever you feel like it. Ly, you're dealing with a spirit here. Your guardian angel is a baby, it lost its chance to be born. You accepted her into your life, she did your bidding and now you want to abandon her? I'm telling you, an angry spirit can do a lot of damage. This doll is messing up your head, you have to tear down this room! Or there'll be consequences. - These three seem pretty close. - Hold on. There's more. This is what we got from Cuong's laptop, there must be hundreds. Get me information on the other two. What are you doing, Ms. Nam? What's wrong? I came this afternoon... When I was cleaning, I heard something. Heard what? It's hard to describe. But... Like something scratching on the wall. And... It came from the altar room. I thought maybe you got a cat, but the scratching got more and more frantic. What did you see? You should see for yourself. YOU THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF US? THIS PHOTO IS TOO BLURRY, WE'VE GOT BETTER ONES. Mommy's so sorry, I'm never going to leave you again. Can you please help me one more time? Take a close look, these people want to hurt me. I beg you... punish them for me! I THINK MS. TAM AND HER GROUP ARE UP TO NO GOOD. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. Can I go up to the penthouse? Are you interested in renting it? Sure. SHADY KUMANTHONG GROUP BUSTED! Why did Baby Na hurt Huyen? Huyen only meant well when she warned me. She's my best friend. Warned? Warned you about what? She said something about a shady Kumanthong group and police were onto their scams. Is that so? Sis. What if... you and I... we're being played here? Huyen was just imagining stuff! Look here! It's your penthouse! Why did you trick me into joining that group? What are you up to? What's wrong with you? Are you possessed? There's no trick here. You're lying! What about the penthouse? You're so paranoid. I moved, that's all. I needed a bigger place because we have more members now. A few joined after you left, you're not the only one in need of a guardian angel. What the hell are you laughing at? You think it's funny? You wanted to silence Huyen, didn't you? You think I'm scared of you? I'm going to call the police on you. I'm going to reveal all of your deranged schemes. I only see a deranged girl sitting here. You can't deny the power of Kumanthong. Baby Na gave you everything. Fame, love, revenge. The three who hurt you are now dead. You got Khanh. What else do you want? Khanh? I never told you his name was Khanh. Thank you for bringing me all these opportunities. I know you listen to all my prayers. Only I can help Khanh. Na, if you love me... punish them for me! The three who hurt you are now dead. You got Khanh. What else do you want? I never told you his name was Khanh. Khanh, they recorded me! They heard it all, they know everything! You see. Huyen was right. It was all a scam. It's all right. Calm down. I can't breathe. What are you doing? It's over, Ly. What are you saying? If you had just told the police everything you told Baby Na... it wouldn't have turned out like this. What? Phuong loved you like a sister. But... Even after Phuong was shamed in public and died a tragic death you still would not reveal the identities of those men. You were afraid of losing your shot at fame and fortune. This was the only way... and I knew my plan would work. Plan? You helped me get revenge for Phuong. WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY OR DO YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE PHUONG? Phuong was everything to me. We were going to get married. You know... I loved Phuong more than anything. When she died... I had nothing left to live for. I swore I would avenge her at any cost. I would stop at nothing. So it was... all part of a plan? I thought... What did you think? That you deserved all that? Everything you have now, belonged to Phuong. Even your doll. Na... was Yuki. And according to my plan, you have to die. To bury the evidence. All the blame would point towards you. I planned everything that way. Khanh. Khanh. You can do whatever you want to me but please, can you let me do one last thing? One last thing that I need to do. I beg you. This is the truth that I want everyone to know. HUYEN, LY IS CONFESSING. SO SHE'S BEEN LYING TO US ALL ALONG. Phuong warned me about those people but I didn't listen. There were three men in masks who hurt Phuong. And I... WHAT A SHAME I CAN'T HELP YOU WHAT'S THIS NONSENSE. TIRED! I wore a mask every day to protect myself. Uncle Hai, Ly has a new clip. If it wasn't for me, you would still be alive. You would still be a star, admired by millions of people. If it wasn't for me, your father would still have a daughter. I'm so sorry, Phuong. Huyen, now I know there's no such thing as a guardian angel. But I know I have one true friend, that's you. You were always by my side, protecting me. Dad, please don't be disappointed in me. I still remember all you have taught me... but I couldn't help it. I got to live the life I always dreamed of, but perhaps I didn't deserve it. If there's a next life, I still want to be a singer. But not like this. Even if you clear Phuong's name... it's too late. I want you to live, to truly pay for what you did. HUYEN I'm sorry. We found blood from a third person at the last crime scene.
