And a number to call. 0k. Than ks. - Bye. - Bye. Hello, mom... Fine. It was fine. I'm good. Yes, I know. Fine, kisses mom. Bye. It's mom. Hi love. Very well. And what did he say? Fine. Say yes.

Than ks. - Are you with someone? - Eh? - I mean, are you dating someone? - Ah, no no... What are they giving you now? Still with Amictal, and now Rivotril at night. What did mom say? - Right now? - Yes... ...she said something that worried you. One of her coworkers passed away. Who? You don't know her. What happened to her? I don't know, she didn't say. Dad, Dad... Dad! - What's going on? - I'm feeling really bad dad, I got bitten by a spider. Look. - It looks like an insect sting, yes. - Yes, it is. It is a sting. A very ugly spider. - Take me to the Hospital. - It's nothing. Dad, it is a big spider. Please let's go to the hospital. I'm really not feeling well. - Listen to me. - I'm listening dad but please let's go to hospital. It was a huge spider, probably very poisonous, I am not feeling well. My arm is hurting. Really Dad, take me to the hospital, that's all I ask Can you do it? Taking me to the hospital? That's all I am asking, nothing else. Let's go to the hospital. Yes, it was a spider, but it doesn't seem dangerous. - Did you see it? - Yes - Describe it. - Well. Quite big... Brown and hairy... it looked poisonous. The local ecosystem is changing, new animals appear, specially in old houses. But by what you say it is not poisonous, you would have other symptoms. Make a fist. - What are you giving me? - Cortisone. But I feel an itch, a burn, and my arm is feeling numb. Well, forget your arm. Open slowly. Done, hold this, there it is. Do not remove the bandage. And do not scratch. He is on acmital and rivotril. 0k, take half a doses extra of rivotril in the morning. Anyway I'll prescribe something for tonight so he can rest, We are going back tomorrow. Ten or eleven hours, I don't know. No, I will not argue about it. We can talk it over later. Hello? Anybody': home? I'm here. Yes. No, where? Hi. I'm sick. It is there. - What happened with the spider? - I killed it. How are you feeling? Sick, I feel my arm numb... ...and I have a strange sensation, I don't know. Let's see... Calm down. It is hatching. Look kid... ...we call that spider the bad spider. Some call it the vampire spider. The bite is deadly. The only way out is to get another bite from the same spider. You are dying, kid. - What's your name? - Jeronimo. I'm Ruiz. Ruiz? Ruiz! Let's rest a bit. - Ruiz! - Usaj. - Who is he? - He is a cop that takes care of the forests. And can't he help us? This guy does not believe in what you have. Ruiz, why can't he help? Ruiz! Ruiz! Why can't the police help? Ruiz! Ruiz! Ruiz! Ruiz! Listen to me, so you don't break my balls the whole way, It's been a few months since people starting dying of gangrene. We didn't know what it was... but then we realized it were the spiders. They still don't believe it. A few weeks ago a... ...nine year old girl was bitten. ...high fever, sickness, until she have extreme delirium. Then a spider entered through the window... ...and the mother tried to kill it. She can't. The spiderjumped on the girls face and bit her eye. The next morning the girl was cured. So save your energies and walk. This sons of bitches are blowing up the mountain. Son of a bitch...
