Hey, Lion. Hey, Lion. Brother, you up? Yeah, what's wrong? We're gonna be good, Lion. Yeah, I know, man. I mean, I can see it. I can see our future when I close my eyes. We got it all laid out in front of us. I can see our house. We each got a walk-in closet for all our silk shirts and handmade Italian suits. - You know where it is? - In California. Stan, if I don't go to sleep, I'm not gonna win tomorrow. We're not gonna lose. It's fate. With a new day comes new opportunities. A chance to change everything. What we can or cannot do comes down to what we believe is possible. What will you choose, fear or hope? I challenge you to make your life extraordinary. What does it take to live an extraordinary life? Having focus. Up and at 'em. Time to eat. Lion. Yo, Lion. Come on, Ash. Eat this shit. Your wrist bothering you? Just aches. It's fight day, baby. I'll get you some ice and a hot towel. None of that mixie goes to Ash. All right? Come here. Good boy. All right. Oh, fuck! All right, come on. Put your hand on the frame, all right? Right. Let's do it. Let's loosen up. One, two. One, two. One, two. What's going on, Barbara? Looking good. Something wonderful's happening tonight, ladies. I can feel it! Beast from the northeast right there. Lion Kaminsky in the fight of the century. That right, bro? Would you shut up and go back to work? You know, Lion's fighting Lefty Denunzio tonight down at Raoul's. And who the fuck is that? Just some dude who's old as shit. You should come. It's gonna be fun. The odds are stacked up against us. I mean, it's stupid, bro. We can't lose. You can come in right now on the ground floor. You're a bookie for your own team, huh? Kaminsky, you're a fucking weasel, man. Why you gotta be like that, Clem? See, this is your problem. That's why you're going to be here for the rest of your life. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Making tea towels and shit. While me and Lion, we're gonna be over in California. Right, bro? Building the Lion brand. - Ooh. - Making tracksuits, sweatshirts, getting sucked off by movie stars. Who's gonna suck you off with them fucked-up shoes? Oh, sorry. Excuse me, man. - I gotta take this. Yo, Lion. - Fucked-up shoes, talking about getting sucked. Cover me, all right? Fucking nice car, man. I always wanted one of these. You got the money? Yeah, I got it. Pepper couldn't bother showing up himself, huh? Yeah, I guess he's big-time now. That's cool. It's cool. What is this? Pepper said you owe him two grand. It's all I got. Un-fucking-believable, man. Buck... ask Pepper if he'll let it ride on the fight tonight. What? Come on, the kid's looking unbelievable. You never learn, do you, Kaminsky? I'm just excited. Pow, pow. You're gonna get your legs broken, man. I'm telling you, it's a sure thing. - Ah, all right. - We good? He says he'll float you the rest. - All right! - Get out of the car, man. - Close the door. - Buy this car off you tomorrow. How you feeling? - Great. - Yeah? Yeah, I feel great. You know, we cannot afford to lose tonight. Yeah, I know. How much is the cut? Look, you don't need to worry about that, all right? You handle your business in there, and we will get a cut you will not believe. I mean, a win tonight will open up a lot of doors for us. We could change our lives tonight. All right. Come on, give me a little roar. - Let me hear you roar. - No, man. - I'm trying to focus. - Give me a little roar, Lion. What, are you fucking embarrassed - in front of the dishwashers? - No. Use the jab. Use the jab. He can't touch you. This guy's older than dirt! Beautiful! Beautiful. Make him fight another day. Yes! Yes! Come on! That's it! Stay down! It's over. You're too old for this, man. You look awful. Let him up. Let him up. That-a-boy! Work the kidneys! Work the kidneys! Make this motherfucker piss blood! Don't get stuck! That's it! Work the kidneys! That-a-boy! - What is he doing here, Stan? - What are you talking about? What the fuck is he doing here? - That's nothing to do with us! - You made a deal with... No, man! That's nothing to do... Lion! Protect yourself! Protect yourself! Lion! Block! Done. Done. All right, I'm done. You were supposed to win, Lion. You shouldn't have lied to me, Stan. You told me you wasn't gonna deal with that scumbag no more. Yeah, well, we needed the money. Stanley, where the hell are we gonna go, man? You know, for a guy who hates moving as much as you do, you really don't do much to help the cause. You were supposed to fucking win. Okay, Ash, come on. Jesus! Fuck! Where you going? Hey, I was looking for you at the fight, man. I didn't see you. Did you not make it? Fuck! You owe me money you don't have. I could kill you tonight, but I'd never get a return on my investment, so I'm offering you an opportunity. Jungleland. Battle royal for 100K. Wild-ass, no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle event. A week from today. I can get you on the card. - I could do that. - Why? Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth here. This is... No, I'm asking him why. Nothing for nothing with you. Right, Pep? I saw you. I saw the way you moved before you took that dive. That look in your eye. That... That rage. Heard you could've been Golden Gloves out in Hartford before Stan got your ass kicked out the way he always do, right? Now, wait, that was a complicated situation. Now look at you. Fighting like a fucking savage. For what? Peanuts? Plus, you got no choice. Where? San Francisco. There is one thing I need. Are you decent in there? Sky... meet Stan Kaminsky. Him and his brother, Lion, they'll take you out west. Come on, Pepper. I can't be moving girls right now. No, it ain't like that. I don't know... I'd handle it or have one of my guys handle it, but, look, she's a friend of the family. Here's my problem, all right? It's always been the two of us. - This could be a complication. - She's cool. She's cool. She's a bit of a handful, but she's cool. Just keep an eye on her. All right. Just 'cause I gotta ask. This doesn't have anything to do with Yates, does it? - 'Cause I'm just not trying to be... - Stanley. Take her to this address by this time next week, and Lion stays on the card. - "Party Animals"? - Don't fuck it up. Opportunities like this don't knock twice. Hey. You serious? I left some petty cash and a special gift for you in the glove. Told you this was my car. We're in an economic boom, Kaminsky. Go forth, prosper. What the fuck? If you understand the building blocks of key relations, you can have ultimate success. It's the pyramid of achievement. It is only in our darkest moments, our moment... Are you still working on that? Go right ahead. That's quite an appetite you got on you. You ever take a break to talk? What's with the rattail? I had it since, like, forever. I'm thinking of cutting it. No, you're not. You should. You see? You don't know what you're talking about. That's his lion's tail. This gives him power. Look at him. He's like a wild animal. Get off me, man. Fuck off, Stan. Jesus. Hey. I love you. All right. - Tell me you love me. - I love you. Tell us about yourself. I like to know who we're traveling with. What do you want to know? Like, who you are. What do you do? Where are you from? Anything. Look, you seem like really nice guys. I'm just not really in the mood to talk. Gotcha. I do have one other question though. Just... Last question. Are you like a... Am I what? I mean, you know. A pro. - Stan. Come on. - I just meant because of the circumstances. I'm not a hooker. It's nice to know I make a good first impression though. That's all I wanted to know. We don't think that, okay? My brother's an idiot. I'm not an idiot, I just... We've been working towards something. Something... Something very big, all right? I mean, these are spectacular goals we're talking about. And since we gotta spend the next week together, I just... I just need there to be a level of trust between us, that's all. I gotta use the bathroom. Again? I'm sorry. Is that in violation of your spectacular goals? I think she's doing drugs in there. She seems kind of cool. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Hey, look at me. No distractions. - All right? - Come on. Just be nice, Stan. - Come on. It's nice to be nice. - I'm nice. I'm always nice. Got a hundred grand on the line. We good to go, princess? Looks like you're in luck, folks. So, that's one night in the Caesar suite? That's the nicest suite you got? The Caesar is the only suite we offer. We'll take it. Do you have a card to hold the reservation? Sir? I'll pay cash, amigo. Don't trust the banks. Pass the fucking grappa, baby. There's a hot tub. And only one bed. Requesting backup. We got a hot tub situation over at the Venus de Milo. Gonna need 12 Coors Lights and three Mountain Dews, stat. Do you guys mind if I jump in here first? Sure, go ahead. I'd actually... All right. You want to do this? - You want some of this? - Don't knock the fucking ribs, man, don't. Want to fight? Want the toe pop? Want the toe pop? Not the toe! Not the toe. You get the toe. You get the toe. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Got you back. I got you back. - You ain't got nothing. - Oh, shit. Rear naked choke. - You ain't got it. You ain't got shit. - After I put you out. You ain't got it. You ain't got this. - Not that hard to put you out. - All right, all right. Motherfucker. All right. You want to watch something? Want to watch that? A strong showing tonight by Kreski. Obviously, he's in the middle of three of his most exciting performances. First with Nunes, then last month against Pirelli, and now tonight, a career-making caliber fight against the champion, Emmet. A strong, experienced, and very motivated opponent. Well, at 5'7" and 159, this middleweight is just one pound from light heavyweight... I'm going to take Ash for a walk. I'll be back. Thirteen KO victories in 19 professional fights. Get dressed, Rocky. We're going out. Where? Saw a bar around the corner we could go to. Cheers to new friends. What's happening, boss? - Did you see those... - Whoo! Darlene, get your fuckin' ass out here! Never mind. Hi. I came to say congratulations. He's a lucky man. Oh, um... It's my sister Gina. I don't know why I'm wearing that stupid thing. Which one's Gina? Uh... go big or go home. - Savage. - Yeah. I like your pants. - Yeah? Thank you. - Mm-hmm. They're from Italy. I like the way they make my dick look. You're funny. Yeah. So, did, uh... Gina get you your own room? Mm-mmm. I'm sharing with six other girls and my aunt. - I got the Caesar suite, but... - Oh. ...I'm sharing with my brother. He's resting right now. He's a professional athlete, so... - Wow. - You know how that goes. Hmm. Well... There's a pool. You think it's heated? Do you actually care? Thanks. If I went to college, I wouldn't waste my time playing stupid games like these rich pricks. Yeah, me neither. I bet you'd be too busy getting it on with all the girls, huh? No, I mean I'd be taking my classes real seriously 'cause of how expensive it is. I would read a bunch of books where you gotta, like, know shit to understand them, and I would study theater and fashion. Yeah, you like to sew, right? I saw what you did at the hotel with the robe. And your name? It looked good, like, professional. Thank you. Me and Stan wanna get our initials stitched onto some dress shirts. So, if we make a bit of money, hopefully we can afford your talents. My mom taught me how to do that. Yeah? Where? Some boring-ass town. Not that far from here, actually. I'm not really that interesting. What about you? Where are you from? All over. New Bedford, Portsmouth, Hartford, Nashua, everywhere. You got parents, or does Stanley cover that too? Our mom died when I was real young. What about your dad? Well, he didn't want us. So... That must've been lonely, you know, not having any parents. Well, I always had my brother. You got any scars? I got some. All on my hands, though. Not on my face. - Can I touch it? - If you want. Go ahead. Just do it. You don't seem like a boxer to me. What do you mean? I don't know. You haven't got that thing. What thing? This thing? I don't walk around going like this to people? "What the fuck are you looking at, huh? I'm a fucking ogre." Exactly. - Yeah? - Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. It's a compliment. I'll take the compliment. Maybe that's my advantage. People underestimate you. I guess. Me too. Whoo! Lion. Lion. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Fucking assholes. What? What? He said the only way that we can play is if I give him a blow job. He said that? Can we just get the fuck out of here? Shit. Lion, don't. How's it going? All right? How's it going? Doing pretty good. What's up, bro? I just want to know why you think it's okay to speak to my friend like that. Uh, I don't know what you're talking about, man. Yes, you do. She said you said something real impolite to her. I want to know why. No, she came over and asked me about my belt. You are a liar. - What did I say? - I came over here. I asked if we could play. You said the only way I could play - is if I gave you a blow job. - Okay, all right. See, here's the problem. This bitch is fucking insane. You should beat the fucking shit out of him. Isn't there a townie bar you guys can go over to? We're not fucking townies. And fuck you! I'll scratch your fucking eyes out! Look down on me, you piece of shit? - Orphan Annie, you know what? - Sorry. Hey! - My boyfriend is a boxer. - Something will get you. Something will get you. That's all I want you to know. - Something or somebody will get you. - Are you drinking? What are you doing? You fucking drinking? You drunk? - I'm having a couple drinks. Why? - Just everyone, go back to what you were doing. Who are you, the fucking social worker? Why you being an asshole? Why don't you go to the bar. I got a tab open. Name's Clay. Get yourself whatever you want. Oh, I see. We can't afford our own drinks? - Is that what you're implying? - I didn't say that. - That's what you thought though, right? - Maybe a little. - You're not listening to me. - I gotta go sit. Guys like us don't have the luxury of settling things with credit cards. - We gotta go outside, you know? - Mm-hmm. Toe to toe. On the street. But that's not what you do, is it? 'Cause you don't know what it's like to suffer. I mean, do you know what it's like to be in pain? I've been to fucking prison, man. You know? - Check that out. Check that out. - Okay, all right. No, I'm not causing a problem. I'm just saying, you can be nice. Yep, I'm being nice. Your buddy just passed out! - Nice guy. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. What are you doing? - Where the fuck is Sky? Get up. - What? You just hit my fucking car! - Hey, are you okay? - Sky! Should I call somebody? What the hell are you doing? - Hey! Where you going? - Wait there. Sky! Sky! Slow down! Sky! What are you doing? Sky! Get away! Get away from me! - What the fuck is going on? - Get away! Get off me! What the fuck did you do to my brother? Get off! Get off! - Calm down. - Get the fuck away from me. - Get away! - You're gonna get us fucking arrested. Calm down! Calm down! All right, look, I'll take my hand away, but you gotta tell me what the fuck is going on. Help me! I won't fucking go back to him! Go back to who? Yates? She's with fucking Yates? I specifically fucking asked you, man. - You're overreacting. - You didn't want to take any of the heat, so you put it on me, like I'm some kind of chump. You had a debt to pay, Stan! And somebody... You fucking set me up, Pepper! Listen, motherfucker, I don't owe you shit. All right? Of course I set you up. Yates? You know, Yates thinks you found Sky. He thinks you're responsible. You know, uh, you owe me a debt. Why the fuck am I gonna look out for you? Hmm? You look out for your brother. This is how it works. You said you wanted to go to Jungleland. Know what? You're right. You're right. Then do as you're told, Stanley. No, I understand. And take this girl straight to Reno. Yep. Stan, listen to me. This ain't one of Yates's side pieces. This is family business. Don't get cute. You have to let me get away from Yates. I made a deal, and I can't get out of it. I fucked up... really bad. And... And he is bad. He is a bad man in his heart. Pack your shit. We're out of here in five minutes. - Stan, why? - Lion, pack for her. Where we going now? I'm sorry I crashed your car, Stanley. Pack your shit. We're not stopping till we get there. Please! He said he was gonna kill me if I tried to run away! If we don't get you to Reno, he's gonna kill us, so... Lion, you're not moving. We gotta move, now. I have cash! I have loads of it! You can have all of it. - Stan, look at her, man. She's pleading with you. - Please, Stanley, please. Please take it, please. Please take it. Please, just let me go, please! Stan, look at her. She's pleading with you, man. There's nothing we can fucking do! Stan, look at her. - Come on. Are we that low? - Listen to me, Lion. - Stan. - I feel for this girl. I really do. But she fucking drugged you, man. It was just a Xanax. Saturday night, we take what's ours. The fucking alternative is that he kills us. Do you hear what I'm saying? Do you trust me? All right. Let's get the fuck out of here, all right? - How are you? - Like you give a shit. I'm trying to be civil. I wish I could help you. But Stanley makes every decision for you. Well, you lied to me, you drugged me, and you smashed our car, so... Doesn't mean I don't like you. Sorry, Clay, your card was declined. Oh, fuck. I don't have 1,400 on me. Well, you're the one who needs it by tomorrow. Look, if we don't get to San Francisco, we're gonna miss a big business opportunity for my family. There's a lot of money waiting for us there. Okay. So, once we get our hands on it, we can cut you off a check. Call it 1,700 for your trouble? Yeah, that don't work for us. Uh-huh. Hey, Sky, how much cash you say you have? You can't take my money. Actually, I can. Lion, check her purse. All right. Hey, excuse me. You know, I didn't see title or registration in the glove. Why you looking in the glove? Kid, come on. - He's using you. - Hold the dog. All right. What we got here? Short. Maybe you shouldn't have sprung for the Caesar suite, moron. Maybe you should shut the fuck up. Who's "Pam McGinty"? That card is expired. Gary, Indiana. How far is Gary from here? Now there is Morris putting up a spot three. They're not gonna help us. This entire thing is pointless. ...with no one guarding him. Now it's Stockton bringing it down. Boys... how do you know Mary? We met at church. At a, uh, church group. That must have been a recent development. And what church is that? It's called the Church of All Seasons. Yeah. Wonderful church. Led by, uh, Father, um... Denunzio. - Father Denunzio. - Yep. The Lord is our shepherd. What is it you've come here for, Mary? It's Sky. My name is Sky. I don't understand that. Why change such a pretty name like Mary to something so stupid like Sky? Nevertheless, perhaps you could answer, Mary. Your father asked you a question. I need some more money. What about all that money you made from that place where you danced? I didn't come here to cause any trouble. I'm trying really hard to be good. If we gave you money again, what lesson would you have learned? So, is that a "no"? Everybody needs a little help from time to time. - You can just say no. - Exactly. It's brave to ask for help. - She's being reasonable. - Reasonable. I didn't come here to be a burden. - I'll get out of your hair. - Mary! We talked about this. We can't have this. We have to set a hard line. She can't just come here when she needs money. It's not there. I moved it after your last visit. Hey, wait for me. Mary, you'll never outrun your circumstances if you continue down this path of sin. Well, you made it look really easy, Mom, with your new life and your new husband. You poison everything you come into contact with. But I'm not gonna let you poison me. Get out of my house. Okay, that's it. Everyone, get out of my house. Take your shit and get out. I want you out of our home, now. These men are hustlers, and they need to leave our house immediately. - Get out of our home. - Call the police. - Don't call the cops. - Get out. Get out of here! - We'll be going now. Right, Stan? - Get out of my house! Yo. You all right? Yeah. Why? - You sure? - I'm fine. I know a place we can sleep tonight. All right, do it. - No... - Fuck! - Fuck! - Did it go through? Do it again, man. Do it again. It has to go all the way... Fuck. I gotta pee. Yeah, well, you're not doing jack shit without one of us watching you. All right. Lion, you gotta eat something. I'm gonna check out the cafeteria. I'll take Ash. - Hey, don't let her out of your sight. - All right. - Can you just go outside? - No. - Why not? - Because I can't. Make a noise. Cover your ears. How much do you get for winning one of these things? A big fight? Couple hundred. You get your ass beaten for a couple hundred bucks? Well, this fight in San Francisco, we'd make a lot more. Why don't you box with gloves? Well, we got our license revoked. Stan tried to bribe a ref. - You're not his possession. - Yeah, I know. So, why do you do it then? Can't you do anything else? Got a business plan to open up a dry cleaners. - A dry cleaners? - Yeah. Hey, tell me if this makes sense. So, Stan likes his clothes, right? Yeah, right. No, he does. He likes to dress smart. On fight night, he really goes to town. And... it'd be good for him. Something that he can put his mind to, be hyperactive and productive. What would happen is, say people got, like, important events, like, uh, weddings or baptisms. So, they need clothes for it. Instead of getting new clothes, they come to us, and we have them looking real fucking smart, like brand-fucking-new. You see here? Look, the best part. "Kaminsky Kleaners." Two Ks. That'll be the hook. That's how you get them. Kaminsky Kleaners. That's not asking for that much. Well, hopefully, after this next fight. I just gotta tell Stanley. You should stand up to your brother. Do what you want to do. I was in so many stupid plays here. Thought I was really hot shit. So I moved to New York to become a dancer. And then what? Well, I guess I wasn't. How did you come up with "Sky"? I read it in a book... and it sounded pretty. I wanted to be free. I met Yates in a club. Promised me he was gonna fix everything, but he turned out to be a liar, just like everyone else. I'm the stupid one though. Well, I don't think you're stupid. I wanna dance for you. Where? Here. In the living room? - Yeah. - All right. Ooh! Ah, you're killing it, Sky. Lion! That's right. Ooh! Let's clap. Clap. Whoo! Hey, don't stop on account of us. Better than my mom's chicken. That's a fact. All right, I gotta go to bed. 5:30 in the morning, all right? Thanks for the dance. Anytime. Sleep tight. You know, I was worried you might try to bail tonight. I'm not gonna run away again. I'm sorry about your family. It's a fucking rough one. What, do you want to be friends now? I know what you're trying to do, Sky. It's not gonna work. Me and him, we're this close to our dream. I'm not gonna let you or anyone else... - You don't know who I am. - I know Yates. You don't know why I do what I do. Look, Sky... I just can't let that kid wake up at 40 and wonder why he didn't do what he was supposed to do when he had the chance. That kid is better at fighting than I ever been at anything in my life. I'm not trying to be a dick, but probably you too. I mean, he's special. And I'll never know what that's like. The problem with California is the taxes. Fuck it. After this fight, once we get this money, we're gonna keep it. We'll be rolling in silk. Monogrammed, perfect. We're gonna get us a good two-bedroom. With a lease. It's ours. And no one comes in that place but you and me. There'll be steak and wine. Steak every morning. That's it. Let's go. Come on, faster! So, turns out Gary didn't quite work out for us. Well, there's nothing I can do about that, sir. Come on, man. I'm sure there's something we can do. Tell you what... 1,400, you get your truck back. I got a crazy idea. How about we fight for it? What's up? We lose, you keep the car. We win, you do the work for free. My guy against world's strongest man over here. - What you think? - I'm good with that. Dude, no. No. Look, this is a business. You need to get out of here with that. I'm talking business. All right? As a businessman, you should appreciate these odds. I mean, look at the size of this guy. He's yoked. Just talk it over. All right? Here's what's going on. I don't want that... What the fuck, Stan? I need you to step up for the family. I'm recovering, man. Come on, man. You can knock this guy out. You knock him out. Hey, I'm cleaning up your mess here. It's not his mess. It's yours. Actually, it's yours. So you wanna butt out? Look, no deal. You get your truck back when we get the money. Guess we're gonna have to deal with this a different way. Jesus. Stan, don't fucking do that, man. What's wrong with you? You stupid? - What's the matter with you? - Wise up. - What's the matter? - Keep your shit tucked in. I got this. - I'm tucked. - Keep your shit tucked in. I need to know. Oh, well, you were in retirement a second ago. Now you're gonna do something? - ...come into the fucking shop. - I get it. - How about two against one? - What? - Two against one, for the car. - Two what? Him and any one of these guys, apart from him. - In a fight? - Yeah. - Come on, man. - You seem like honest guys. - Clean for the car. Clean fight. No stupid shit. - No way! - No! - Fellas, I got this. - I got this for sure. - Stanley, you can't let him do that! We fight and whoever wins, we settle it, yeah? This is an unfair situation. - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. Come on. All right. This kid's made up his mind. There's nothing you can do. - Come on. Let's go! - Go ahead, let's go. If I win, I'm hanging on to the money. - No problem. - And whatever happens, - keep that thing out of it. - You got this. All right, no scratching the eyes. No balls, no biting. Just clean, all right? Respectable. Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! - You done? - Yeah. - We done? - Oh, yeah. You're done, man. Yes! Yes, that's right! Come on. Pay up. Give me the keys. Come on. Give me the fucking keys. - Could I get a cup of coffee? - Sure. Last supper. Anyone gonna say anything? Dad, look, a whippet! Sorry for that. We've always wanted one of these guys. His favorite book to read before bedtime is Wiley the Whippet. You guys read that one? It's great. Is he friendly? Not really, dude. Jesus. I feel like we're in the fucking Wookiee bar. Am I right? Stan, we can't do this, man. Can't do what? Take her to Yates. Been through this, kid. It's out of the question. Let's take her to San Francisco. He knows where we're going. All right? He will find us. Why don't we just bail and go somewhere else? Fuck the fight. Why do you keep making it like we got options? Like we got all these sweet deals and people looking to hook us up? We don't. We... We got options. We got one option. All right? We fight, that's it. I fight. That's right. You fight, and I'm the business end of this company. Company? What company? We're not a company, man. We don't have a front door. To have a company, you need a front door. All you do is... What? All I do is what? Cling on. And ruin shit. Sky tell you that? Don't make this about her. I can think for myself. Then say that again. I dare you. Look me in the eyes and say that again. 'Cause I know it takes you a minute. You use me and my talents and what I'm good at. Everybody knows it. Oh, really? Everyone knows it, huh? That's something. You're really something. You can't do anything without me. I do everything. You got one talent. One. And that's your fists. I got things happening, all right? I got shit going on. Oh, what you got? You got some things? I got ideas. What, your dry-cleaning business? Yeah. You can't do shit like that, man. 'Cause you're not smart. And what's your plan, man? You think we're gonna get, like, a small business loan? Is that what you think? That we're gonna use our good credit to get a fine deal on some retail space? Get one of those fucking machines that swirl around so you can find your pants? Shh. Shh. I mean, what are we talking about here? I use you? - What the fuck, man? - Keep it down. - People are staring at us. - I use you? Are you crazy? Hey, partner, it's a family restaurant, man. Oh, then why don't you eat your pizza with your fucking family? Stanley, shut up. Unbelievable. I make sure your hair's cut. I teach you about fashion. I sleep on the hard floor so you always got a bed. I skip meals so that you're never hungry. And what do you do? What do you do? Nothing. What do you say? Nothing. Ever. Do you know why? Because it never occurred to you to have any gratitude for the person who's given you everything! I give you everything! I ask for nothing in return! And it's a good job because I don't get it! You're scaring the dog. You think I like living like this? You think I like having no possessions? I mean, I know I look like I got it all covered, but I'm tired, man. Hang on, hang on. How many 25 year olds you know got arthritis, huh? - I got fingers that don't bend. - There's a dog there. I forget shit that happened yesterday because my brain don't fucking work. You think your life's hard, Stan? Shit, I'd be a professional boxer now if it wasn't for you. You are a professional boxer. No, I'm not. I fight guys two-on-one in parking lots so you don't get another felony. I'm supposed to protect my fucking hands, Stan. I'm supposed to protect my hands. You got me a job at a fucking sewing factory. - Can you please quiet your dog? - We're a joke. We're a fucking joke. If you don't get that dog out of here, - I'm gonna call the police. - I'm sorry. Quiet, Ash. - I love you. - Good boy. Come on. She doesn't love you. Good boy. Can't you see that? She's turning you against me, man. - Dolores, call the cops. - He's a service animal with fucking documentation! - Get him out of here. - Totally inappropriate. All right, I'm sorry. Dolores, please, don't call the cops. I'll get his papers from the car. All right? In fact, better, we'll leave. - Thank you! - We'll take that to go. - Good. - All right. Outside, you two, now. Oh, no. No. Fuck me. All right, they're towing the car! - We gotta go! - Walter, sit down. Come on! Get the fuck out of my way. - I said it's a family restaurant! - They're towing my car! Take this, meet me out back. Hey, here. Right. Stolen. It's registered in Massachusetts. Call it in? Yeah, I just called. Fuck! Where's the money? Tell me you didn't leave the money in the car. I'm gonna take Ash for a walk. - I'm proud of you. - For what? For standing up to him. There's a 7:20 to Reno. All right. - They know we're coming. - Where's Ash? What did you do with Ash? Come on, let's go. What did you fucking do? - Lion. - Huh? What did you do? - We needed the money. - Huh? Huh? - Lion... - What? What fucking money? - You sold him? - I loved him. - You sold my fucking dog? - I loved him too. You sold my fucking dog? He was my dog too! - He was my dog too! Lion, stop! - Give me the money. Approaching Carson City Station. - Please remember to grab your belongings. - Sky. - Sky. Sky. Come on, shh. - Second to last stop. - Next and final stop, Reno, Nevada. - Come on. We're getting off. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Reno. Last stop. Where's my brother? I don't know. Passenger assistance to door 127, please. - Passenger assistance. - Kaminsky. Hey, what's happening, fellas? Where's Sky? All passengers on Penn State Line, Bus 506, Chicago, Lake Street Station, should board at door 306. Please remember to bring all your bags with you. If you see a package unattended, please report it to the nearest attendant. The 12:18 bus to Philadelphia has been delayed. Miss Antinoff, please report to Gate 305. Please remember to keep your belongings with... Twenty-three dollars. Where do you want to go? We don't have enough money. Next bus, Tucson, Arizona. Next bus, Tucson, Arizona. I care about you, Sky. I don't think you deserve half this shit you're going through right now. I think you deserve a lot better. The way I feel right now is I want to go to the booth, pick a place, buy a ticket, and go. So, let's go pick a place and go somewhere. We could go anywhere. Where do you want to go? Pick a place. Do you like dry-cleaning? You want to come dry-clean with me? Let's go do that. - What do you wanna do? We could... - Lion. What? Shut up. Oh, shit. - Don't worry. - Huh? Don't worry. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Shh. Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh. Fifteen dollars in cash, an expired driver's license, uh... ...another man's credit card. Oh. Now what do we have here? Is this the big stud who stole my mama? Count to a hundred before you leave so the bartender doesn't get suspicious. He was giving me weird looks. Is it Yates's? It's mine. We didn't touch her. Milos, uh, unmuzzle our friend, please. I swear to God... we didn't touch her. She took my brother, and she fucking ran. That feels like an untruth. I don't know anything. Pepper, he didn't tell us the whole story. A girl told me to give this to you. The 4:25 express to Oakland now in the station. 4:25 express to Oakland. Mr. Feldstein, please return to the information desk. The thing is, Stanley, there's only so much money can do for a man. I mean, look around. I own a successful chain of pet stores. I move women through 19 states. I'm a successful businessman. But I've come to the conclusion that possessions don't matter. A house isn't a home unless you have someone to share it with. And in my heart... I think I might be... a family man. Nobody lives forever. Lord knows I'm trying. I take 37 vitamins a day. Christ. I haven't pissed yellow in ten years. You have any idea how... how difficult it is for a man my age to produce a viable sperm specimen? Oh, Lord, my cock barely even works anymore. I had to use one of those machines like they use to milk cows. But it did the trick. And I finally found my vessel. You mean Sky? Yes, Sky. Fuck! Fuck. Fucking hell! We had an arrangement. We made a deal. No! I'm not sure what Pepper told you. - And guess what. It's a boy. - I don't know anything. - I would never lie to you. - All right, go. Go. You're not important anymore, Stanley. So, tell me where Sky is, or I'm gonna eat your fucking heart. You understand? We're talking about my legacy here. I don't understand what's happening. Sky belongs to me. Shit! Easy now! Easy... Easy, tiger. Now, just take it easy. I think we can negotiate here. All right, give me the knife. Knife. Let me put it to you like this. Sky's gone. She ain't ever coming back. She got her hooks into you too, eh? When you see her, don't forget to tell her that boy she's carrying belongs to me. And I don't give a damn if I have to cut that baby out of her belly myself. Sky will never live to hold my boy in her arms. All aboard, 407 to Emeryville. Last call. You all right? Look, we don't have to do this. We can just fucking bail right now, start fresh. We done it a thousand times before. Let's just get the fuck out of here. Go somewhere where no one knows us. No, we're fighting. We're fighting. Why you not talking? I'm sorry. Just stop, man. Stop it. A-Anything I ever did that hurt you, all right... Stop, stop, stop. Stop, man. Stop. Let me focus. You're special. And you're the greatest fucking thing I ever saw. Nothing bad's ever gonna happen to you again. I'll protect you, no matter what. All right. - How you feeling? - Like shit. Out of shape, unprepared... shit. Kaminsky, one minute. All right. This is it. Showtime. - Here, check this out. - What? Where the fuck did you get that? Huh? - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Jungleland. - Sky made it. - In our second undercard of the night... - It's beautiful. - ...with a purse of $100,000, we have in the red corner... - I mean, that's a work of art. She's got some real talent. - With a record of 23, 2 and 1, Giomo! - You look like a fucking prince. Like a king. In the blue corner, from Fall River, Massachusetts, in his first professional fight on the circuit, Walter "Lion" Kaminsky! Coach. How you doing? Gentlemen, welcome to Jungleland. Are we ready for this today? Good clean fight. This is good here. This is good here. Anything below that is low. Got it? Touch gloves. I want you out on the bell. Red corner ready? Blue corner ready? Fight. Try to get on the inside. Then outwork him, right. You're faster than him. Hey, ref, what the fuck? What the fuck was that? - You all right? - Yeah, back of the head, ref. Ref, you gonna call that? - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. Let's fight. Come on. What, you got fucking money on this guy? Guy's a fucking machine. Stay out of the corner! Get out of the... Okay. You're all right. - Stick to the move. All right? - Two. - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, yeah. No, get out of the... Hey, out of the corner! Don't fucking trade with him! Break. Break. Lion! Lion! Lion, can you hear me? Lion, open your eyes! - Lion! Stay down. - Two. Just stay down, all right? Three. You don't have to do this. You already won! - Four. - You can throw this. - We'll do something else like we always do. - Five. Six. - Just stay down, all right? - Seven. Just let me call it. - Eight. - I love you. Nine. Lion. You all right? If I see something, I'm stopping it. Yeah! Come on! Yes! Beautiful, Lion! Beautiful! Fight. I'm Stan Kaminsky. I believe you're looking for me. You're under arrest. Yeah! Stan? Where's Stan? Where's my brother? Lion! Lion! Yes! Yeah!
