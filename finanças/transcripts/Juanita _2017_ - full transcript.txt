My name is Juanita Lewiston. I work second shift here at Saint Pete's. Well, now they call it Fairdell Medical Center. Whatever. Ain't like nobody talked to me about a name change. I'm still the one cleaning up the messes these bitches won't clean up theyself. - Hey, girl. - Hi. Some of the patients are nice though. Like Ms. Berman here. She's sweet. But it ain't like I love my job or nothin'. It's just work. Five-, six-day weeks. 2:30 in the afternoon, 12:30 at night. Hey, and it ain't like I'm-I'm sleepin' and takin' long bubble baths in between time neither. 'Cause I have a family. - Hey, Ms. Berman. - Hey. This my grandbaby, Teisha. Teisha, how'd I get to be a grandmama? Hmm? That is something you don't know, isn't it? You do not know that. I'll tell you how. Let me introduce you to my daughter, Bertie. My mama told me to wait to have kids, and I did. But I should've kept on waitin'. I did the best I could, but Bertie, she dropped out of school, had this one at 19, and then moved in here with me and Rashawn, her brother by another father. Rashawn just smart enough to where he ain't got no job, but he always got a pocket full of money. He ain't nearly damn smart enough for witness protection, know what I'm sayin'? I'm a fuckin' ghetto cliché. And you are my little ghetto grandbaby doll, ain't you? Look, it's Swee'pea. Mom. Mom. - Mom! - What? You smilin' at the TV again. Ain't nothin' wrong with smilin'. I like Popeye and Swee'pea. Ooh! Teisha, you shit your britches, didn't you? - Ma, I'm going out. Can you keep her? - Uh-uh. - No. This is my only night off. Come on. - But I ain't been out in two days. You ain't goin' out tonight neither. Come get your child. But I'm dressed. - Where the hell Rashawn? - He not here. Look, she gonna go right to sleep, okay? Then you can have this place all to yourself for once. All right? I love you. I got to go. Teisha, your mama's a ho. You know, right? - Juanita. - Look. Blair Underwood. Ever since I met you, it's like I'm... like I'm breathing from a different place. - It's like a drum. - I just want to make you happy, baby. Can I do that? I've been working at this place for nine years. My take-home is still $12.50 an hour. Folks be talkin' about, “Least you got a job.” I understand that. But I ain't even got time to get nothin' from Blair Underwood in my dreams. - Vincent, Jacob, hey. - Hey, Juanita. So fuck me for not countin' my blessings. How's your other son? Um… R... Starts with an “R.” Randy. He fine, Ms. Berman. He in prison, but other than that, he doing real good. - Well, that's nice. That's nice. - Yeah. Oh, sorry, here. Yeah. Okay. So has he made any new friends? - No. - No? But his triflin' brother Rashawn probably be joinin' him soon. So there's that. Well, that's great for both of 'em. Yeah, they can move in together. Yeah, and pick out curtains. Oh! Oh! Ms. Berman used to be a dancer. She been to Europe a bunch of times. Nighty-night. I get in a workout on the yard every day with some brothers that's got my back. I don't get to play ball as much, 'cause that's when I get to the library. That's good, baby. That'll make the time go quicker. Ain't nothin' making time go quick in here, Ma. I know that. But you're using the time in a good way. Yeah. Better than being a knucklehead, I guess. That's what I'm talkin' about. You are a smart brother. I'm proud of you, Randy. I believe in you. Thanks, Ma. Listen. I was thinking that I might... I might take a little trip. I need to go away, Randy. There's somethin' I gotta do. Where you gonna go? I don't know. But sometimes I feel like, if I don't get out of Columbus, I'll lose my mind. Damn sure know that feeling. Do what you gotta do. Okay. Oh... All right. I don't know when I'm gonna go, but when I do, I will let you know. - All right. - Time's up. Wrap it up. Let's go. I gotta hang up now. There's a lot of brothers waiting. But you go on. And don't worry about me. Oh, okay. I love you, man. I love you too, Ma. I gotta get back to work. Hey, how's... What? Where you goin'? I-I got some ideas. - You don't even know? - I ain't decided. Ma, you trippin'. That's just some bullshit. No, it ain't. You need to get yourself a job. You need to look out for her and this baby. Ma, you ain't goin' nowhere. This ain't real. The fuck it ain't. Y'all grown! I ain't gotta be up here waitin' on you. You got to do for yourselves. And I do not have to tell you where I'm going or when I'm comin' back. Matter of fact, I ain't gotta do shit for y'all no more. Oh, man. Get your baby. Oh, shit. I still don't know where I'm going. But after that, I better start packin'. Juanita. Oh, my. So… Florida? Absolutely. But they got hurricanes down there, Blair Underwood. - And half them folks can't speak English. - Yes. But Miami is exciting and very fish. Yes, but Miami is exciting and very sexy. Is that what that mean, baby? Yes, I fell, my darling mama. - Don't call me “mama,” Blair Underwood. - Oh, right. - I ain't your mama. - Right. That's my bad. I'm sorry. - What the fuck's the matter with you? - I don't know. I don't know. All right. Check it. Come on. What? What? Come on. There it is. Ah! Don't hurt yourself. Don't hurt yourself. So… So you really think Florida's a good idea? That I do. And speaking of good ideas… - Mm-hmm? - I'm thinkin' we might, um… might try something a little different tonight. - Oh. - What do you think about that? What do you have in mind, Blair Underwood? Well, I might, uh, do a little of this. Mm-hmm. - Uh-oh. - And then I might move this here. Then I'm gonna work on this little bunion. Ha! I'm gonna work my way right on down the line. - But before I go any further… - Uh-huh? …There's something I need to know from you. - My safe word? - No. - What I need to know is… - Mm-hmm? …Can you front me $50? - What? - No, well, 60. Sixty would be perfect. No, I cannot front you $60, Blair Underwood. It's not for me. No, it's for a project I'm doing with Denzel. Parker, my-my neighbor. So we need some seed money for this muffin truck idea that we're developing. Now, it's a food truck, but just muffins. Oh, no, no, no. I ain't hearin' this. - Come on, baby. You know I'm good for it. - I don't know that. Yes, you do! Look, I'm here. I'm taking care of you. Come on. All I ask is that you, you know, you take care of me some, that's all. - Take care of you? - Yeah. You too? I got three grown kids by two deadbeat daddies, Blair Underwood. All right, I understand. You want some time to think about it. - I don't need to think about it. - It's cool. - I'll be back. - When? When you get your mind right about my proposal. You believe this shit? The only man I got just tried to borrow money from me. And he ain't even real. I know one thing. I ain't goin' to Miami. Matter of fact, let me just see how far in the opposite direction I can get from Miami damn Florida. Excuse me a minute, darlin'. - Where you gonna go? - West. Towards… West. - How you gonna get there? - On the bus. You just gonna get on a bus and don't know where you goin'? I... I just haven't decided yet. Are you sick? Did you catch the cancer from one of them patients of yours? What if you get one of your panic attacks? You can't... You can't catch cancer. Listen, my rent is paid up to the end of next month. And Bertie is going to need a job, so... Bertie been needin' a damn job for a while now. Instead of sittin' there letting you wait on her… Now she gonna have to get one. So if you wanna help her and me, now's your chance. - Okay. All right. - Thank you. You're very welcome. I just came to tell you that I'm gonna take this trip. And I'm gonna miss you, but not that much. Not at least for a while. - You think you funny. - I am funny. No, you're not. For real though. What's the matter with you, Juanita? Rashawn's half a thug. Bertie's trying to be a ho. And Randy's the one in prison. Randy. And I'm not… I'm not doin' any of 'em no good, and I can't. I'm just… I'm just nervous and sad most all the time. Oh, Kay-Rita, there's got to be something more out there for me. So I'm just gonna go. I'll call you. Gonna miss you. Kay-Rita always talk about how I spoil my children and that's why they triflin'. I hate it when that hussy's right. I'd like a ticket to “Butt.” I believe it's pronounced “Butte,” Montana. Oh, okay. Uh, then one-way to Butte. Yes, ma'am. That'll be $197. Is it nice there? In Butte? I don't know. I don't think I've even sold a ticket from here to Butte. - I'm the first? - Mm-hmm. Do you have family there? Oh, no. If I had family there, you still wouldn't have sold your first ticket to Butte. Thank you. Have a good day. A turkey leg and some slaw. Still good. - When you smoke 'em, it stays fresh. - Mm-hmm. I don't need to find Jesus, Mama. Jesus need to find me. 'Cause I didn't do nothin' other than get in the car with one of his friends. He don't usually carry no gun. I wouldn't have got in the car if I knew he carried one. I know. I know, baby. Look. That's why I'm tellin' you, just go about the business of finding Jesus. - Oh, please. - Shh. Now that way you're gonna be with folks that's doing that instead of bad stuff. Time's up. Let's wrap it up now. I'm gonna do my time my way. Y'all need to go. I'm gonna come see you, every month. - Every month I'm coming to see you. - You ain't gotta do that, Mama. - I love you. - I'm gonna be all right. Oh, shit. Louisville. Next stop, Louisville. Lord, is all of Kansas this flat? You must be going crazy from all them lines on the road. Somebody wake the driver! Oh, hell. I'm gonna need elder care before we get off this bus. - Denver, Colorado. - Oh! Who…? What…? Driver. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. I bought the wrong ticket. I-I needed a city, like LA, Dallas, the-the one where all the Waiting to Exhale girls are from. - Oh, yeah. Phoenix. Yeah. - Phoenix! Phoenix! Wait, you read Waiting to Exhale? You know, I live in Phoenix. Used to be people moved there for their health. Not anymore. Oh, hey. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - You're connecting to Butte, right? - Well... I just saw that on a map. But the mountains, they're just too big. I can't go up in them mountains. You just need somebody to talk you through it. Have a good trip, all right? Oh! All right. You're gonna get your butt back on that bus, or you ain't nothin' but a little punk-ass bitch. I'd do what she says. Butte, Montana. Huh. Guess you ain't a punk-ass bitch after all. I guess I ain't. What's your name? - Juanita. What's yours? - Peaches. Hey, Peaches. I'm Juanita Lewiston. - Mind if I sit? - Yeah. I mean, come on. The pot roast is decent here. What are you havin'? - I'll have the pot roast. - And I'll have a... - That girl don't approve of me. - I ain't so sure about you neither. Well, that's all right. Still got a chance with you. Uh, you are mistaken. I'm just playing. Besides, you ain't my type anyway. - Mind if I smoke? - They let you smoke in here? Well, technically, no. But we're in Montana. You know, folks here think they should have the right to drink, smoke, drive, and shoot a gun all at the same time. But God forbid my hand ends up in your pants, or suddenly everybody's in danger. - You want one? - I quit. But I am gonna order a drink. Excuse me. I'd like a cold beer and a shot of bourbon, and whatever Peaches is drinking. Mmm. Well, I gotta drive this big, hard, powerful truck through a long, wet, sleepless night. So I guess I'll have a Cherry Coke. Oh, shit. I got some stories. - What was the charge? - Attempted murder. But you just said Randy didn't know the gun was in the car. It don't matter. The prosecutor said Randy knew the boy was in a gang. So once he got in the car, it amount to the same thing. - What? - Look. We talkin' about my neighborhood, all right? Some of the kids that my kids grew up with is in gangs. Most of 'em ain't. Some of 'em carry guns. Most of 'em don't. But as far as the police is concerned, they're all suspects 'cause they black and they know each other. Hmm. They get the young ones convicted of something, and then they don't have to go sort niggas out at the precinct. You know, you get a rap sheet, you ain't gettin' a job except for with the gang. The police is puttin' more kids in the gangs than the goddamn gangsters. White people don't want to believe that 'cause it ain't happenin' where they live. I believe you. Oh, please, girl, do not get me started about right and wrong. What, you ain't gotten started? My shift is over. Feel free to tip. What, for this crap? Juanita, something tells me Butte was not your final destination. No, but I hadn't planned on going further tonight. I know a place that's a little friendlier. Why don't you let me give you a ride? I'm right behind you. Come on. Bye, darlin'. Whoa. You got a whole world up in here. - Welcome. - A whole world. Do you like my rig? Tonight, I do. Well, if you wanna float off to sleep, you can crawl back to my rack back there, catch a wink or two. Juanita, I gotta ask you something. Why did you get on that bus in the first place? 'Cause if I'd have stayed, I'd end up hating the people I'm supposed to love. And I damn sure wasn't going to Miami. - Miami? - Yeah. It's a long story. I just needed a place to be on my own for a while. Well, I think I've got you covered. Hello, I'm Blair Underwood. And, bam! There it is. Ladies, do you want to put some emotion into your lotion? Motion into your lotion? Then try me. Try “Sexy” by me. Because I'm-I'm sexy. I'm... What? I'm workin' here. - You're in my shot. - Your shot? - I'm talk... Come on! - You triflin'! Fuck! Fuck! Well, good morning. Sorry. I was dreaming. Yeah. Cussing up a storm too. At a man, I presume? He ain't even real. Where is this? Where is this? Welcome to Paper Moon. Oh, Peaches, this is the dead-up sticks. This is the place I was telling you about. Don't let the outside fool you. The cook knows what he's doing. Uh, don't stay at the motel. The manager's a peeper. There's a boardinghouse up yonder. Old gal named Millie owns it. That's where I stay when I come through. Don't worry. She takes all kinds. Uh, here's my card. I get through these parts every couple weeks or so. So call me. Or, you know, don't. It's, you know, whatever. Hey. Good luck, all right? Thanks. And the bear says, “You didn't really come here to hunt, did you?” - Hello. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey. - Coffee? - Oh, yes, please. Let me know if you need help with that. - Wait... - It's French. Oh. Well, I just want fried eggs, crispy bacon, hash browns, and some OJ. The special this morning is croque monsieur with capers and smoked salmon. That don't sound like breakfast. Or eggs Benedict. It's two poached eggs, Canadian bacon on English muffin with Hollandaise sauce. Okay. I don't do poached. Can you just fry 'em up? - We don't do substitutions. - Well, we could, but he… - Can I talk to him? - Can I watch? Mom! - Oh, Jess? - Yeah. - Good morning. How can I help you? - Morning. Could I please have some fried eggs, crispy bacon, and hash browns? Our menu doesn't include that. I can offer you an eggs Benedict. Um, thanks, but I don't do poached. They don't agree with me. Could you just flip 'em over, fry 'em medium, butter the muffins, and hold the sauce? Here it comes. We do have the herb omelet with andouille sausage and a croissant. A croissant sounds good. But what I really would like is some regular whole wheat toast with my fried eggs and bacon. - Ma'am… - Juanita Lewiston. Jess Gardiner. This is my place. Oh, it's really quiet. - I don't do substitutions, so… - I ain't askin' you to substitute. Just rearrange the ingredients so they come out like breakfast. - I'll drink to that. - Dear God, sweet music. Mr. Gardiner, I just rode seven hours in a big truck with a lady named Peaches who speaks very highly of your cookin'. I'm so tired. And I'm hungry. And I would really appreciate you fryin' me some eggs, please. Ma'am, this is my restaurant. I'm not a short-order cook. See, that might be the problem right there. I mean, no offense, but something is wrong up in here. I mean, it's the only place for miles. It's cute as hell. Y'all should have lines out the door. True that. I'm establishing a fine dining experience. It takes time for that. Well, I don't know about fine dining. But it's 7:00 in the morning. This here is a diner. - That's what I'm talkin' about. - Lady's making a point. Yeah, you know what, Jess? You make a really good cup of coffee. There ain't no ifs, ands, and buts about that. And the crescents that you make, those are pretty damn good too. But I think I speak for the little lady and pretty much everyone around here when I say we do not want French cuisine breakfast. Period. Don't want it. And if I have to spend another winter chewing on my wife's frozen waffles, I might as well go ahead and shoot myself in the head and put myself out of misery. Geez, Drew. Come on. - I don't want that on my conscience. - Well, then deal with it. So all of a sudden nobody likes my cooking? Tell the truth, my friend. Well, Juanita. Since you started all this, why don't I lend you an apron? Excuse me? Or are you here on vacation? Not really. - But I don't know how long I'm staying. - Then stay as long as you like. I'll pay you on a trial basis to cook breakfast for one week. Two weeks. Cash. All right. I'll have my niece Mignon and her mother, Mary, show you the layout. Fine. Fine. What can I do to help? You could go ask those guys how they like their eggs. Tell 'em after they've ate to go spread the word. - Black lady cookin' at the diner. - Okay. Bacon, butter, biscuits for everybody. Y'all got biscuits, don't you? - We've got the ingredients. - Well, then. - Go on. - Okay. Okay. I have stepped into some shit. - I gotta say, nice job in there, Juanita. - Mm-hmm. - Want one? - I quit. So did I. You shouldn't stay at that motel. The guy there likes to peep. I'm aware. Millie's boardinghouse is a lot better. Just let her know you're working with me. She'll give you a discount. This is the biggest littlest place that I have ever been. Well, it's a shame that you're scared of the outdoors. I'll be all right. Come on. I'll take you to Millie's. Oh, you don't have to. Just take it off. I'll take you. Thanks. - Thanks for the tasty breakfast. - You're welcome. I wish I knew how to poach an egg properly. Well I'd be happy to be the first to show you. But I'm sure you need to freshen up. Asshole. - I mix water and vinegar. - I don't care for vinegar. The vinegar you don't taste. It's just to keep the egg together. Then I slowly turn it around. I like to plump up the egg to make it look like… White girls' titties. Okay. Well, we'll cover it up. Then we grab the salade. - Salad? - Yes. And then we reach for the… titties. Correct. Yes. Dip them in the ice-cold water, so it stops the cooking process. And then I take it out. Put it there. Take off the excess moisture. You add your garnish, voilà. - Bon appétit. - Same to you. - Hey. - Oh! Be right back with the cash, Mountain. - Hey. - Hey. I'm the deputy sheriff around here. - Deputy sheriff? - Mm-hmm. They call me Mountain. - I'm Juanita. - Hi, Juanita. - Here you go. - I'm off duty. - See you. - See you later. None of my business. No, it's just that I've had problems with credit and… It's a long story. Try the eggs. Okay. It's good. Jess won't be in today. - Why not? - It's “E” day. It's the day my brother reminds everyone he's just another drunk Indian. - He's what you call a binge alcoholic. - He's getting a lot better. - How do you figure? - He talks in whole sentences now. - Not to me. - Well, yeah. Okay, what the fuck's “E” day? Desert Storm, on this day 23 years ago. He won't let it go. And what, everybody in town knows what “E” day is? - Well, it's a small town. - Pretty much. I thought he might've trashed the place like he did last year, but… Well, even he knows he can't afford to do that again. Where does Jess live? Oh, shit. Jess? Jess? Hey. Juanita. Jess, your hand. - I wasn't expecting anyone. - Where's your first aid? Jesus, shut up. I'm not gonna be covering for you every time you lose your mind 'cause of some guy named Eddie or whatever other shit you got goin' on. How do you know about Eddie? Apparently the whole town knows. It's like it's a holiday around here. If I'd have known, I could've slept in. I didn't ask you to come see me. I can take care of myself. Yeah, this is you taking care of yourself? You don't know about anything. Huh? I know enough to know that you ain't right. Look here. I've seen bodies. Boys that I've known since they were in Pampers. Was it your fault? Did you tell them, “It's clear. You can walk through. I checked. There's no live ones”? Then ten feet later… his body parts were everywhere. Eddie had my back. I should've had his. Well, now you can't. So you gotta look after yourself. Yeah? My ride. I have to get back to work. Wait, how did you get here? I walked. I done told you already. I don't know where she is. And I wouldn't tell you if I did. - Hello? - Kay-Rita. I'm gone five minutes and you miss me already? Hey, girl. What's up? What's wrong? What happened? Nothin'. Everything's fine. - Bertie's fine. The baby's fine. - Is that her? Rashawn's still dumb as dirt. - What happened? - Let me talk to her. Mama. Mama. - Hey. - How you doin'? - I'm fine, Rashawn. How are you? - You know how it is. I've been, like, thinking, you know what I'm sayin'? How's that going for you? What you thinking about, man? For real. I'm lookin' to make a change, and like, get out of the game for real, you know? Oh, really? That's good. Yeah. No doubt. For real, right? But I'm gonna need, you know, just like, some dollars, you know, to help me make this transition in my life. The transition from jail to bail. And that transition ain't happenin'. - I'm tryin' to talk to Mama. - You tryin' to go in her pocketbook. - You believe this? - She ain't got time for that. - Let me talk. - Juanita. He gettin' out the game because he got a warrant and he's scared. - No I ain't. - Look, he is still my baby, Kay-Rita. You said yourself your baby's half a thug. Well, he got a choice now. He gonna be a whole thug or he gotta get out for real. You just gotta let this thing play out, girl. The police is here. - Let me talk to him. - Yeah, all right. - Mama? - Rashawn, shut up and listen to me. I know you scared. And when you get inside, you're gonna be even more scared and you're not gonna be thinking right. And when that happens, I want you to stop and think, “What would Randy do?” And you do that. You hear me? Your brother's gonna be fine, and you are gonna be fine. You just… You have to keep your mind right. You understanding me, Rashawn? - Yeah. I hear you. - Okay. I love you. Love you too. I gotta go. Garnish, garnish, garnish. Got it. Got it. Orders are backing up here. - Everybody ready? - Hell yeah. - Juanita, ready? - Wait, wait. What powwow? - I'll tell you on the way. Come on. - Hey. On the way to where? You know what? It's up in the middle of the mountains, ain't it? I know 'cause I looked it up on the Google. - Google. - Right. Maybe you could tweet it to us so we know how to get there. You know what? Fuck all y'all. It's gonna be fun. We're gonna be feeding a bunch of hungry Indians. And don't worry, I got your wheelie bag of bricks. Shut up. - You shut up. - You shut up. Go! Dusty. - How are you, buddy? - I'm good. Right on. Pleasure. Where should we park? Uh, right on up there. - All right. I'll see you in a bit. - See you in a little bit. Keep the wings coming. Jess! Jess! - Yeah? - Jess. Come here. - Yeah? - Give me your arm. Take me over there, please. I need to sit inside. Okay. Well, just have a seat here and… - No. I'm telling you, I need to go inside. - Okay. My heart's racing. I can't breathe. Jess, I can't... I can't breathe. - Just listen to the drums. - Yeah. Yeah. - Feel your heart beat. - Yes. - Better? - Mm-hmm. We're gonna say a short prayer over you and bless you and cleanse you up. And then we'll sing a song for your spirit to heal you. We ask the Creator to help us… …To bless us and watch over you. We ask all the spirits of the earth to come and help you. We ask the old people, our holy people, the ones that passed on, to come and help you. So all your energy that will go inside the smoke will go into the Creator's world, so that you think of all the things that will help you, all your relatives that come and help you. As we sing this song for them, we call on their spirits to come in and give you a hand. We cleanse your body so you can travel in a good way. Your life will be good again. It's up to you to keep it that way. Thank you. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. - Seen Juanita? - No. Wishing she was sleeping with you in your bed there? Thought she was bunking with you last night. Well, she was. But she's not there now. And I didn't know whether you and her had… It's not such a crazy idea, is it? She went that way. All right. Thanks for the coffee. So what's wrong? I wish I hadn't gone this far from my kids. I miss 'em so much. But I wasn't doing any of 'em any good. You gotta do what's right for you. Do you know what you've done for me? Look, you've helped turn my business around. And you patched me up the other day. I... I appreciate you, Juanita. Come on. I'll take you back. Don't want people to think you're crazy. What are you all smiling for? The food that good? - I'm hungry. - You hungry? - I love that hair color. - Thank you. - Oh, man. - What's up with you? It's my shoulder. It's just out of place. It needs something to rest on. All right. You better not get us in a wreck. - I'm the one out of my belt. - We can share my seat belt. - Shut up. - No, you shut up. Ooh! Hey. - Carl! - Oh. All right. Oh, my. Oh, my God. Jess. Jess. Jess. Hey. Jess, hey! Shh! Breathe, breathe, breathe. Okay? Hey. Shh. - You all right? - Oh, Juanita… Yeah? Oh, goddamn. This terrible dream… Yeah, yeah, I got that. God, I could use a drink. Okay. All right. You go ahead and get one, and I will be on my way. What? No. I... I don't want one. It just helps to say it. Well, that's bullshit. See, that's puttin' it on me, so when you drink, then it's my fault. I know the territory. I ain't sticking around for it, Jess. I... Hey. I wouldn't do that to you. You don't know that. That's true. I'm sorry. Look, I do want a drink. But I'm not gonna. I want you to trust me. I don't know if I can. Well, that's fair. Can I make you some breakfast? You know they put us together as a joke. The Blackfoot Montana Indian… and the black kid from Newark. - Thank you. - Welcome. Before we went to the Gulf, we already had plans to work together after the army. I was gonna show him how to cook. I think that's why I like black people. I told Randy not to get in the car with those knuckleheads. I been telling him that since before he was old enough to cross the street by himself. And he'd always say, “Yes, ma'am. I won't.” But he did. He made a mistake. So did Eddie. It's not our fault, Jess. Voilà, breakfast américain. - Bon appétit. - Thank you. I like you. I like you too. - But… - But what? - We ought to take this slow. - I don't know, Juanita. You know me. I enjoy the fast lane. I'm... Jess, I ain't playin'. I mean, I wanna keep moving. Then keep moving. I'll be here when you come back. - Bullshit. - What? - Do you mean that? - Yeah, I think so. - You think so? - Well, yeah, I mean it. - You don't believe me. - Why the fuck should I believe you? I mean, this is all nice, but drunk motherfucker in the kitchen, he ain't so nice. And what about you, always stumbling everywhere? The black woman who always has her guard up. No one's perfect. But no one wants to be alone. I don't mind it. I took this trip to be on my own, and this certainly is not my last stop. I'm going to California to see the ocean. And I want you to see it. But when you come back, you better take that bug out of your ass. Maybe I will, and maybe I won't. Man, I miss you already. - Hey, welcome back. - Hey. - Juanita, you look great. - Doesn't she? - What'd you do, get a makeover? - Wow. No. I think our secret is out. Oh, God. I'm working. I'm working. Stop. No, no, come on. - No. - Yeah. I'm not ready for all this. Ready for what? This. Mama? Randy! What-What are you doing here? - Did you escape? - No, I'm out on parole. You know, they have so many brothers locked up, somethin' had to give. And I've been doing good, staying busy like we talked about. Oh! Oh... - How did you get here? - On the bus, same as you. Mountain just dropped me off from town, so… Morning, Miss Juanita. Oh, my God. - Why didn't you tell me you were coming? - Surprise. - I'll be damned. Oh, my God. - Ma, Ma, Ma. - What? - I'm hungry. Oh, hell. Yeah, let's go. Oh! Oh! - Hey, everybody. This is… - You gotta be Randy. - Hey, how you doing, Mr. Gardiner? - Call me Jess. - How you doing, Jess? - Too late for breakfast. - I can offer you coffee. - Shut up. I got you covered. I got you. Hey. Here. I got… I'll keep five. I'll have the rest to you when I'm able, all right? - That's all right. Long trip? - Long, yeah. All right. This is, uh... - Drew. How was the bus ride? - Long. You had no right to keep it a secret from me, Jess. - It wasn't my decision. - Oh, bullshit. He didn't want you to know. Why not? 'Cause he knew you'd get anxious waiting for him all weekend. No. He knew you was buyin' him a ticket. I loaned him that money. He said he'd buy the ticket himself. And you wanted me to come out and cook for y'all all weekend. - What? Jesus. - Yeah, yeah. You want to be the man, keepin' my black ass in your kitchen. What? Now you're making things up. Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere. - Drag you? - Mmm. Juanita, there is no possible way that I could ever make you do anything. Hey! I wish you'd go ahead and just yell at each other so I can go back to sleep. It's noisier than prison. Shit. All this whispering is what woke me up. Oh, and, Ma, I told him not to tell you I was coming. - Good night. - Night. Now can we go to bed? - Let's try this again. - Okay. The vinegar in the water is to keep the egg together. - Twirl it around like the whirlpool. - Okay. - All right. Just like that. That's good. - Okay. Crack it, keep it close 'cause it's gonna suck it in the middle. - There you go. - Okay. Voilà. So keep at it, and, uh… be better than your last five eggs. - Say hi to your big mama, Tee. - Hey! - Go on, now. Say hi. Well, at least wave. - Tee! I told Bertie I wasn't gonna hire her if she was gonna be late or lazy. Tell your mama what you said, Bertie. I told her, I said, “I don't need no job from you, Kay-Rita, - 'cause I got me a job at the Kroger.” - Ooh-hoo! Go on, girl! And she wasn't lyin', either. Got her a job! And last week they made me assistant manager. Damn. A manager? Oh, girl. - Teisha, quit. Lord, this baby is strong. - Bye, Teisha. Bye, baby. She doin' real good, Juanita. Maybe I oughta leave home more often. I guess so. When you coming back? Not for a while. Oh. You like living in… What is it? Paper Cup? Paper Towel? What is it? - Paper Moon, fool. - Paper Moon. Right. - Girl, I can't even find it on the Google. - That's 'cause it's just little. - See, I couldn't do that. - Why not? It's bigger than your neighborhood. Oh, so now it's my neighborhood? Shit. You was livin' here six weeks ago. And you just gonna what, live in Paper Plate the rest of your life? Look here, when Randy showed up, the black population of Paper Moon doubled. If y'all come, all the white folks just might up and move out. Then it'd just be us and the Indians. We'd have the whole place to ourselves. Speaking of Indians, tell me about Cochise. Jess Gardiner. He's nice and good and all that shit. But… I don't wanna talk about him. Why not? Because my trip ain't over. And if I come back here after I go to California… then we can talk about Jess Gardiner. Oh. All right. Now. No stalling. Where Rashawn at? Well, he out of jail. He on probation 'cause he's a first-time offender. But he's gotta do 100 hours of community service or else he going back to jail. I don't know if he gonna stay off them corners though. I mean, I just don't know. Hey, I believe he will. Hey. Rita, I gotta go. - How I look? - Oh, you look good, girl! - Ooh! - Did you get a makeover or somethin'? Ha, ha! Or somethin'. - Bye-bye, my sister. - Come on, y'all. Come on. Say, “Bye.” - Thank you. - Bye. Say, “Bye.” Bye. Okay, who had the trout amandine? Millsy says he caught this up in Alaska. Huh. Oh, bullshit. - Hey, Peaches. - Hey, sug'. - Hey, fellas. How's it hangin'? - Good. - Lower and lower. - “Springtime fresh.” - Comfy. - Hey, girl. - Mary, what's the specials today? - Trout amandine, medallions with beef on pommes frites, and Mediterranean smothered chicken. All right. I'll have all of them and a Diet Coke. Gimme the chicken. - Glad to see nothing's changed. - Pickup! Hey, Jess. You're looking nice. Two more and a poached egg salad. Salade des œufs. Say it. Salade des “oof.” I say it for the customers. Say it to me. I love when you talk dirty. Oh, Lord. Ordering Mediterranean smothered chicken for Peaches. Chicken. Got it. Poulet étouffé. - Who's the new cook? - Randy, come meet Peaches. This is Juanita's oldest son. Well, hello, Juanita's oldest son. Speaking of dates, how's my new girlfriend? Your girlfriend? I have to go get her. Peaches, make yourself useful. Don't forget the eggs. Eggs! Sh... Come on, woman. I got no time. You also ain't got no manners. Just get in. I don't know why, but I'm gonna miss you. Then don't go. You know, I've been to California. All the people there are shallow. Oh, yeah. I forgot. - You all deep and shit. - Hell yeah. Eyes closed. - Keep 'em closed. - They're closed. All right. There you go. Oh... - I got you. - Oh, God. - There we go. - I'm getting dizzy. We got it. Watch out! That's not funny. - Close your eyes. - I'm getting dizzy. All right. Here we are. Hold it. Open your eyes. Now, I will be here. And this place will be here whenever you wanna come back. Voilà. “Chez J and J.” That's nice. It's nice. And they will too. Surprise! Yeah! - Get a room! - Close your eyes. California, here we come. Come on, girl. Peaches, you got some precious cargo there now. You take care of her. Have a safe trip. I knew it. I knew that if I waited long enough, you'd come back to me, Juanita. - Hey, Blair Underwood. - Hey! - Ain't it a little early for that? - Nah, it's the weekend. It's Tuesday morning. Right. Well, it's Tuesday brunch. It's a Hollywood thing. - You want some? - No. - Here. - No, you go ahead. All right. So look here, Juanita. Uh, so this whole you-and-me thing ain't gonna work out no more, huh? Nope. Not a chance. All right. I'm good with that. Say, Juanita, you remember that cooking show I told you about? Mm-hmm. I remember. “Cooking with Blair Underwood.” Right? Right? So, we've run into a little bit of what I call a cash flow problem. I got to go, Blair Underwood. Oh, okay. Sure. Juanita? You look really nice. - Did you get a makeover or something? - Ha! Somethin' like that.
