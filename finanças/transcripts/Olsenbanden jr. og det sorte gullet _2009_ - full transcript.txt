That's that! This is working like a dream, Egon. Perfect, Benny! -Shall I change your oil? -No. Oil is so expensive. FIN-late oil. Perfect for Kjell's bicycle chain. But where is he? He's so slow! He can't be last in every bike race. lt's embarrassing! Biff is slow too. Problems? -Flat tire. -Not really Zip it! I need a break. I've got a side ache. -You've been sitting the whole time! -I can still get a side ache! There he is! At least he's ahead of Herman. I need a break. I can't take anymore! Quick, get offyourbike, Kjell! Even the girls are faster than us. Ingrid, maybe I should wait for Kjell. He looks exhausted. Wnat good would that do? He's the slow one, Valborg. Not you. A little oil, and you'll catch up to her like...greased lightning! Look at this! That should do it. Hurry up! Herman can't be far behind. Come on! Don't give up! You can still come in next to last! Off you go! Stop! Oh no, not them! We're catching them, Herman! Do something!Anything! But not that! Daddy! No! Egon, l have a chicken bone to pick with you! You'll get house arrest for this! Come on, Kjell! lmagine two months' house arrest! That's a new record. Do you have the ﬂags? There he is! Welcome to freedom! -Good to see you again. -We sure have missed you. -How are you? I've never been better! -Wnere are our bikes? -Times have changed. -Kjell has moved. -Yeah. To Kjelsas. So we have streetcar money, instead of bikes. OK. -The Kjelsas line. -Bravo, Kjell! You've gotten a whole part of town named after you. Wait till you see this place. It's really swell. So what's happening this summer, Egon? -Any fun ideas? -This will be a summer to remember. Look at this. -Wnat does that mean? -Oi|! How? Aguy named Engineer Hallandsen is looking for oil in the North Sea. They've been searching for months. If they ﬁnd any, we'll all be rich! -Are you sure? -V\/e'll be as rich as this guy Sheik El-Altan is a wealthyArab. He wants to sell oil to Norway. But if we ﬁnd oil in the North Sea, he won't sell a drop. And we'll be the rich ones instead! Tiptop, Egon! -80 oil is worth a lot of money? -That's why it's called "black gold". -Everything is brand new! -Yup. -Dad even has a new car. -Ho|y smokes! -Is it fast? -No. Dad can hardly afford any gas. Hi, boys! Nice of you to come visit us up here. -Nice set of wheels. -|sn't it? Too bad you can't afford to use it. Gas is so expensive these days. Let's hope they ﬁnd oil in the North Sea. If that happens, gas will probably be free! Let'sjust keep our ﬁngers crossed. Then we can go for a drive every Sunday. Get up here, Bassefar! We have dishes that need washing. Coming, Gudrun! I've ﬁnished washing the car. -Do you want to come in? -No. We're going up in the woods. -OK. See you later. -Wnat's in the woods? Wait and see! Wnat do you think? We built it while you were doing time. We had to have something to do. -Come on in! -Swe||! My own patent! -Stocks! -Stocks? We're going to buy a share of Viking Oil. -Then we'll own part of it. -|sn't that expensive? Today's price is 50 kroner. But the oil searchers will be back tomorrow. At exactly 9:00 am. Hallandsen will reveal if they have found oil or not. And then? If they have found oil, our share might be worth millions. Millions?! Yank my mustache! A share like that would be swell! You said 50 kroner? Yup. So the first thing we have to do, is raise some capital. -There you go. -4 kroner and 50 ore. Hi there! I wouldn't buy that if! were you. -Give your money to me instead. -To you? -Are you sure about this? -Positive. -Forget about it! -But Valborg. .. I believe in this. We can get rich together. -You and me. -How rich? Why buy one ice cream today when you can buy two tomorrow? -Two? -Of course we want two! So I'd get two full piggy banks instead of one? Or one that's twice as fat! Egon mentioned millions, but he tends to exaggerate. But I'm sure you could afford that electric hairdryer. Electric hairdryer? Yes! 50 kroner and 10 ore. We can even afford some gum. Swell! Right, KjeII? Sure, but what if Hallandsen doesn't ﬁnd any oil? -Then the stock is worthless. -So we should wait, to be sure. Right. But we have to buy our stock before everyone else. Once the news is known, the price will skyrocket. How will we find out before everyone else, Egon? -l have a plan. -TIptop, Egon! Is it dangerous? Wnat was that? -Hi, guys! -Hi, brother. -|s Dynamite Harry involved? -You betcha. Nice explosion! Amere sample. In addition to Harry, we need a mirror and a cloudless sky. The plan is set! Everyone ready? Harry, keep the gunpowder dry Gotcha. And l have an extra short fuse! Kjell. the mirror? -Mom's make-up mirror. -Good. And lend me your bow tie. -There! -Good luck! Good morning! Wny are we here, Holm? Stocks. l've invested all my savings in \ﬁking Oil. Are you insane? How can you gamble with your meager income? Relax, Kjell. You heard Egon. It's a foolproof plan. Wnat about Harry? I don't see him. We can trust Harry. He'll fire it once he gets the signal. See? They're ready to call the stock exchange. Oil or no oil. That's all they need to know. -Hi, Kjell. -Hi, Valborg! Where is Hallandsen? l'm anxious for my money. He'll be here any minute. -Hi, lngrid. -You're planning on getting rich? Isn't that great? My aunt says stocks are for wimps. I'd rather have a paper route. Mirror? The clock has struck nine. The moment has arrived. There he comes! lt's him! Engineer Hallandsen, what can you tell us about oil in the North Sea? We have had great expectations regarding Norwegian oil. Our conclusion is clear. There is not a single drop of oil on Norwegian territory. -So much for that adventure. -|'m broke, boss. I knew it! Stocks! It's all nonsense. Wnat about my electric hair dryer? No! -No, Valborg. don't... -Kje||! No! Oh no! What will Egon say now? Cabbage brains! l'm surrounded by imbeciles! Radishes! -Egon... -Don't give me that! We had the chance to do something huge. And it all went down the drain because of you incompetent amateurs! Amateurs?! I'm no amateur. You'll never hear a better salute than the one | just gave you! My aunt says: If it's too good to be true, it probably is. And she knows what she's talking about! I'm going home to wash my hair. It isn't my fault that gull pooped on me. Wait! Something's going down. Look. That guy wearing the sheet is Araban El-Altan. The oil sheik. Wnat is he doing here? I don't know. But something's afoot here. Look out! -I need a mirror. -ButValborg, l have... Wait! We have to get on board that ship. Hello. My name is Valborg. Whaleborg. Hi, Valborg. l'm Osram. Did a gull poop on your head? -You speak Norwegian? -Yes. | used to live at embassy. -How cool! The embassy? -A||ow me. There. Now you look better. -Come on, Kjell. -No, I can't leave Valborg. Fine, stay here. -Nice car. -Thanks. Want to look inside? I'd love to! -Take good care of it. -Thank you. Perhaps you have something for me? Look at this. They are beautiful! Emeralds! -Let's drinkto this. -| neverdrink. You can. -Wnen does our plane leave? -It is ready now. -I look fonrvard to seeing my palace. -Palace with pool and camels. Cheers! Do you play tennis? I love tennis! -I don't. -Aren't you any good? Yes, but I am always forced to practice. He never give me free. -Your father? -My parents are dead. El-Altan adopted me. Now he insists I win all tournaments. All he cares about is money Wnat a horrible man! Let's see... -Oi|? -Yes, Benny. Black gold! Proof that there is oil in the North Sea! Holy cow! Thank you, my friend. -Sweetcase! -Excuse me? -The sweetcase is missing! -The suitcase? Hassan! Come on! We have to bring this to the Finance Minister. This is huge! -Wnat about Valborg? -She isn't huge. We can'tjust leave her here! You take care of Valborg. we'll take the suitcase. -We have to stop them! -No. Look. We take him. Hi, Kjell! Meet Osram. I don't have time. We have to get out of here! -You aren'tjealous, are you? -No! -Well, yes. But come. -No! I refuse to budge until I can give that sheik a piece of my mind... Regarding what? You were saying? Your friends take my red sweetcase. Give it back at airport within one hour, or you never see her again! -No, Valborg! -Get into car! There. One hour! Drive, Hassan. If you had saved that share, we would have been millionaires! We'll get a reward for finding this. -This is a historic moment. -I feel weak at the knees. lmagine! Norway an oil nation! All thanks to us. No! Stop! Stop, don't do it! Valborg... -She's been kidnapped. -Kidnapped? If we don't return the suitcase, we'll never see her again. We can't simply toss away our nation's future, Kjell. Sorry. Come on, buddy! -The airport is so far away! We” make it, Kjell. Stop! -We want our money back! -Doub|e! And we want it now! -Sorry, we're broke. -Get them! -This way! -He's crazy! No problem! Hurry up! -There they are! -Bye! You wait! Look! -Little Kjell is about to catch hell! -He's stuck now. We've got him! -Look! -After him! Bravo, Kjell! -|'|| catch you yet! -Gosh darn it! Stocks? No, Holm. That you should sink so low. My thoughts go to your hard-working father. Poor man. Please accept this tiny charitable gift. The sharp cheese, Holm. Thank you, boss. -Daddy! -Yes, son? -There! -We made it! But where is Valborg? Wnat are you saying? Piggy bank? Money? Gone? -But how? -Stocks. Stocks? l have nothing to do with this, boss. -It was Egon Olsen. - The Egon Olsen? I'm not the only one who was tricked. I can't tell you how I itch to get my hands on Egon Olsen! Stop! One boy, come here. Bring sweetcase. -Good luck. -Good luck. Stop! Put down sweetcase. Go back. Let me see Valborg ﬁrst. Hassan, get girl! QaKjeII! - lborg! -Everything OK? -Let go of sweetcase! Let go of Valborg! -Now what? -I don't know. Now that you have the suitcase, could I have Valborg back? If you snitch, then Valborg... Get girl inside! Kjell. how did it go? Are you all right? Stay in your seat! -Bu||y! -Sit still! Jalla! We can't just let them leave! -Wnere are you going? -To bathroom. "Greetings from Cairo"? And a blue tower? They can't bring Valborg all the way to Egypt, can they? We have to ﬁx this ourselves. We have to go to Egypt. Do we? -There they are, boss! -Quick! Run! -No! -Stop, in the name of the law! Surround them, Holm! I'll get yoursavings back, Herman! Come on! This way! -Wnere are they, Holm? -Boss... Watch and learn, Holm. This was your last prank! -Holm, do something! -Police! Police! Here. -Thank you. That will be all. -This way... That was close! Now we can get ourjust deserts in the desert! You? -|ngrid? What are you doing here? -This is my paper route. Valborg was supposed to help me, but never showed up. -Do you know where she is? -Yes, she was... -|t's a secret. -Nonsense! Wnere is she, Kjell? We can't tell you. There they are! They've disappeared. Tell me where Valborg is, or I'll scream. Golly! Kidnapped? Valborg? If you want to help her, keep this a secret. -But what... -Promise to keep quiet? -Good luck in Egypt! -Not to worry, Ingrid. We don't even know how to get there! You don't think l have a plan? That was the last one. l have butterflies in my stomach. Next stop Cairo? We're on ourway! Nice with a little music on our trip. -|'m hungry. Let's eat. -Good idea. Kjell? The food. -Don't look at me. -Wnat? Amateurs! Don't we have any provisions? But I thought Kjell... I brought toilet paper. I thought... Toilet paper? You brought toilet paper?! Mom says to always bring toilet paper when traveling down south. Dilettantes! I'm going to starve because of you radish brains! Guys! Look at this! Dried ﬁsh. As much as we want. Dried ﬁsh? Holm. the Olsen Gang is our no. 1 priority. -Find them at any price. -Yes, boss. -But ljust got a new case, boss. -Wnat case is that? Valborg Eriksen's parents called. She has disappeared. -Disappeared? Wnere to? -They don't know that. She can'tjust disappear! Chief Deputy Commissioner Hermansen. Under Deputy Commissioner Holm. -Kjell Jensen has also disappeared. -As has Benny Franzen. Chief Deputy Commissioner Herrnansen Junior. One moment. Egon Olsen is also missing! Thank you. Egypt, Egon? l have no idea what it's like down there. I know what it was like a few thousand years ago. I had to read history while under house arrest. They made me read page after page about ancient Egypt. -The pyramids, Pharaohs, all that. -Tough guys? My favorite was a god they called Osiris. He decided who to let in to the Realm of the Dead. The Realm of the Dead? Kind of like St Peter and the Pearly Gates. And he had his own star. Sirius. I think that's it. The brightest star in the night sky. -Are you serious? -Yeah. Even though no one still believes in Osiris, his star still shines bright. -How do you think Valborg is doing? -|t's probably unfamiliar to her. I hear the food's pretty good down there. But it probably gets crowded in those harems... Harems? Valborg isn't in a harem, is she? -Could be. -They have harems? 'Fraid so. No leads... We're getting close! -I don't understand this. -Don't worry. We'll ﬁnd Kjell. The long arm of the law is often longer than you think. Come in! Yes? I promised to keep quiet, but I'm worried about Valborg. Go on. I know where they are. Cairo, boys! Engineer Hallandsen seems like a decent man. Most well-educated men are. And Sheik El-Altan looks so nice. It's hard to believe... Don't believe everything you hear, Holm! Egon Olsen and his gang are hoodwinking us. Like all charlatans, they run from their debts and hide abroad. And Valborg? She has let herself be philandered. Still, think if... Holm. we'll never make it to Cairo if you just stand there thinking! Listen up, they can probably tell we don't belong here. You're right. We have to do something about that. -Exce||ent! -You too. OK. Let's... -Wnere's Benny? -Kebab! I came across something delicious. He just said, "kebab," and gave me this. Want to taste? -My tongue is on ﬁre! -Don't eat that. After all that dried ﬁsh, l'd eat anything. The only clue we have is the blue tower. We have to find it. -Maybe that card is a false lead. -I have yet to see a blue tower. -Uh-oh, here comes trouble! -Wnat? Stomach trouble. -We told you that was potent! -I need a bathroom. Kjell. toilet paper! -Thank you. -Let's see... Hold this, Holm. We are right here. Orhere. Or... -Thanks. -Feeling better? You betcha. Oh no, here we go again! It's, it's... lt's blue! This tower is blue! Well, I'll be! We found it! Come on! -We are here. -We can be here or there, Holm. Let me orientate myself. -Bad date? -Those are Norwegian police ofﬁcers. What they doing here? -Maybe the boys snitched on us? -We must hide sweetcase and girl. -The sweetcase! - Right, the suitcase. As anticipated, we are right here. Hi! -Finally you come. -We found the postcard. It took a while to get here. -Wnere is Valborg? -|'|| tell you... Osram ! -Wnat did you say? -| asked if everything was OK. -Yes, ﬁne, thank you. -What did he say? He spoke Norwegian! -Kebab? -You?! -Follow me! -After them! Damn! First the police, now this. I wonder who we have to thank for this. Don't worry. Wnere we going, no one find us. Come! My ear! The key is in it! Go! We lost Egon! There he is! -Here we are, Egon! -Jump! If only we had some clue. Asimple strand of hair... -And this case would be solved. -We could look up that sheik. Don't attach too much importance to El-Oldtown. -E|-A|tan, boss. -A|tan, Oldtown... Wnatever. -That's just something Egon made up. -It couldn't hurt to check the sheik. Fine, if you insist, Holm. Perhaps he'll invite us in for tea. Taxi ! -Wnere did they go? -They drove down here. There they are! I recognize their car. The palace of El-Old... El... -O|dtown? -A|tan, boss. Bravo. Just checking if you're keeping your head cold in the heat. Wait here. I don't think anyone's home. Wnere is Benny? I made itjust in time! We'll neverﬁnd Valborg if you keep having to go to the bathroom. Come on! Something's going on over here! Leave thisto me, Holm. There they are! They have someone with them. -Valborg! -No, Kjell. Notnow. We can't let them know that we've seen them. Come on! Let's follow them. I've never driven a came! before. Have you? There's a first time for everything. It isn't dangerous, is it? You're cute! Yank my mustache! She's in love with you! Fine, if you insist, Holm. -Someone screamed. -A damsel in distress? I doubt that. Have you ever heard a damsel in distress? -Not that I know of. -Then save your opinions! I've got butterﬂies in my stomach! Follow me! -Wnat can that be? -A damsel in distress? Come on, Holm! Benny... Benny Franzen?! Boss! -Look, boss! -Aha, the Olsen Gang! Holm! Holm! You can't head into the desert on foot! Aha! -Are you there, Holm? -Yes, boss. -How are you doing? -Fine, thank you, boss. -But... -No buts! Fine isfine. But for how long? This came! must be 100 years old. All the better! We have secured an experienced beast. Come on! Walk! -Sure this is the right way? -We're following their tracks. l'm thirsty. Wno brought water? -Kje||? -Water? Amateurs! If we die of thirst, it's because of you amateurs! Get up! That's an order! -Maybe it has run out of water. -Nonsense! Camels have spare tanks. Fine, we'll just ride shank's pony. -Shank's mare, boss. -Mare, pony, whatever, Holm! -Kje|| fell off! -Wnat? How are you? I'm ﬁne. But I can't go any further. We need to take a break, Egon. It will be too dark soon, anyway. -What are you burning? -Dried ﬁsh. Thanks. If we don't ﬁnd water tomorrow, we're dead meat! -There it is. -Wnat? -Sirius. -Right. Osiris' star. Bright as a ﬂashlight. No wonder the ancient Egyptians called it "the sun behind the sun". The wind is picking up. That's all we needed! Valborg! Valborg... -Valborg! -Kjell, you rescued me! -Wnere are we going, Kjell? -To Kjelsas, dear Valborg! And you'll get your electric hairdryer. Kjell. wake up! You're sleepwalking. Valborg?! Lucky for us that Valborg is a faithful camel. Since the other two ran away. Wnere am |? I can't see anything! Help! I'm sand-blind! Oh, here I am. Butwhere is Holm? Holm! Holm! -Thank goodness! There you are! -Wnat? Strange... "Valborg"! I'm back on the trail, Holm! This isthe end. Even the camel has given up. No, I'm sure Egon has some brilliant plan. Don't you? No. No... Only a miracle can save us now. Listen! Yank my mustache! Hey, boys! -Syvertsen! -And Tutta! Ice cream! Hurry! Lovely ice-cold ice cream! -Come on! -Come and buy something, boys! Come on... Holy cow! Wnere did they go? -It was a fata morgana. -Afata what? Amirage. The pyramids, boys! Come here! All this walking has given me blisters! The Sphinx! -Just get me some water. -And Valborg! Wnat was that? -|sn't that... -Osram! Osram ! -Finally you come. -Water! -De|icious! -So where is Valborg? She held prisoner in pyramid. Wnich one? Careful. You can get lost in labyrinth. -Then let's avoid it. -Not possible. Just remember: Pharaoh is boss. -You relax. Have another date. -Thank you. That ghost, that mummy That's superstition, right? Maybe, maybe not. Have you seen my camel? My best friend. l have for 17years. There pyramid where Valborg trapped. Join us. We need help. No, old Pharaoh haunts pyramid as living mummy. Poor Valborg! Hurry up! We have to ﬁnd her before the mummy does. Darn! lt's closed! This is unacceptable! Goodjob, Kjell! I don't believe in ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts. Relax, Kjell. lt's ancient superstition. I'm not afraid of the dark... This is probably where the labyrinth starts. The lion is pointing to the right. If the Pharaoh is the boss, we should go the way he points. They almost look. ..real. There's only one ﬁgure here. Simple! Wait! -His ﬁngers are crossed. -Holy Pharaoh! He's pointing to the right, which means we should go to the left. Only stupid rumors about Pharaoh's ghost. The ghost of a Pharaoh? I don't like that. I don't want to encounter some furious mummy. -We have nothing to fear. -Are you sure? -What are they saying? -Sma|| boys in pyramid. -Wnat? -Come with me. Osram, you stay here. -Do you need me? -Come! This guy's ﬁngers aren't crossed. Not so fast! His toes are crossed! Wnat a character! It looks like a lock. Kjell! Talcum, gloves, stethoscope. l'm hot, Holm. We can't expect rain with the sparrows flying so high. -Swallows, boss. -No, I can hardly swallow either. -This game soon to be over! -Mummys don't like visitors, do they? -Holm! We're saved! Water! -Water there, boss? They don't build high-rises without running water! Don't worry, Kjell. He's dead as a doomail. -Exce||ent! -Sure, but what about Valborg? Careful, Kjell. Maybe it's the living mummy. I don't care. It could be... Help me! QaKjeII! - lborg! -Kje||... -Valborg... Enough already! -Let's go! -First l have to... -No! -Sorry Egon! Kjell. paper please. Take the whole bag! You have no idea how worried I have been. Yech! Cobwebs! Here, you can borrow mom's make-up mirror. Thanks. -Nice, Valborg. -Finish up! | see we have some visitors! You come long way to no avail. How can anyone be so...so evil? -We aren't evil. This is business. -Business? Exactly Business. lf Norway ﬁnd oil in North Sea, we make much less money. -Money isn't everything! -|'m afraid you're wrong. Enough chit-chat! We go, you stay. Wait. I remember, you three boys. Now you only two. Wnere is third boy? Yes! He must be here somewhere! Hassan! -Did you see where Benny went? -No. Me? Right... OK... The Pharaoh's ghost! We're doomed! -Help! -He|p! Mommy! Wait for us! -We're stuck! -There's no lock on this side. -Wnat do we do now, Egon? -I don't know! -Look! It came from in there. -Come on! A staircase! Maybe it's a way out! Come on! The Pharaoh's mummy! Take this. Wow! Thanks, Valborg. The sun! I never thought I'd see it again. "Osiris"? I think I know where we are. Osiris' throne room. Wasn't Osiris the god of the Realm of the Dead? Does that mean we're dead? This must be his star. Sirius. The star behind the star. Wnen the sun out there shines on the sun in here... Then what? Then he lets people into the Realm of the Dead! We should try to get out at the same time. It'll be hours before that sun hits this sun. Nonsense! I'll take care of that, Egon. Wnat's happening? Look out, Valborg! Wnat's happening? No! Let's get out before the dead start coming in! -Come on! -You ﬁrst, Valborg! -Help! I'm being crushed! Help! -Come on, Kjell! Get out of there! Herrnansen and Holm! We have to get down to them. -Come on! -OK... Take my hand. -Come on, Kjell. -Coming. Let me hurry slowly. This doesn't look like a place with running water. Don't say that. Wnile you stand... sit there complaining, - - l have already found the water pump. There's a ghost in here! -E|-O|dtown? -E|-A|tan. And Engineer Hallandsen. -Let me out! -|'|| give you 50 camels! No! Stop! Don't do it! There you are! Wnere do you have Valborg? I'm here! They're the ones who kidnapped me! And they tried to steal our oil! -Don't believe those rascals. -Of course not. Lies and fabrications! We won't let you out until you tell the truth! Yes, I admit everything! There is oil in the North Sea! And | kidnapped Valborg. Let us out! Kebab ! Holm. surround them! The best part is that my shares will now be worth a fortune. Vlﬁth Araban in jail, I can do what I want. -Can you live here, all alone? -I not alone. l have aunt here in Cairo. Aunt Zebayda! Thanks for all your help, Osram. Look me up in Norway. Yes! You aren't so bad either, Kjell. Wnat are you writing, Holm? Never vacation down south without toilet paper, boss. Let's dance! Flags are raised to pay tribute to our new national heroes. And here they are: Egon, Benny Kjell and Valborg. Thanks to them, Norway has become an oil nation. Gas will be free, no one will have to pay taxes. Soon we'll all be millionaires! It sounds like a fairy tale. The crowds cheer with gratitude. The Prime Minister and government are also here to pay tribute. Here is Prime Minister Gerhardsen. On behalf of the Norwegian Labor Party - - and our government, - - I would like to thank you for your brave efforts. We have discussed the matter and decided to reward you. Here is a stock certificate. Ashare of \ﬂking Oil! Thank you, Prime Minister! Ice cream, boss? I can buy, now that my shares are worth so much. Thank you, Holm. You are too kind. Tiptop, Egon!
