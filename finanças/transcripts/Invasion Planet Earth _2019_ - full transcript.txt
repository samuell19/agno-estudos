And now on Channel 3, are you ready for action? Well, hold onto your seats. It's "Kaleidoscope Man." People of Earth, attention. People of Earth, attention. Your mighty battleship is in flames. You are next. Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Kaleidoscope Man, come in. Come in! It's a trap, it's you they want. So, who will save you now? - Intruder alert. - Kaleidoscope Man, come in! Come in! Come in! Dr. Christopher Jones, astronaut, scientist. A dead man, brought back to life by a strange race of alien beings and given super powers. Now, his mission is to protect the human race from the countless alien species that want our home. To them, he is the defender of the Earth. To us, he is Kaleidoscope Man. - I am Kaleidoscope Man! - Defender of the Earth! Hey, terrorists. Dad, Tom wiped out the alien attack. Good job Freddy, I was getting worried about those aliens. One day dad, I'm going to defend the Earth for real. If that's what you want Tom, you do it. And don't let anybody tell you that you can't. Remember, whatever you do... Be spectacular. That's right, be spectacular. What happened with it now? Sump's leaking oil again. Tell your mum I'll be a few minutes late. Here Tom, take this. I keep on catching it. And don't lose it. - See you, Dad! - Bye, Dad! Secretary of Defense Dee Chilton declared that the United States and her allies would not sit quietly if General Lucian continued to refuse full entry into his country's weapons facilities. The prime minister has chaired a meeting of Cobra to discuss the possible links between the terrorist explosions and the recent expulsion of Chinese and Russian dissidents from their UK embassies. Come on Mandy, I need to get scrubbed up early... before I get gutted. Gutted? What's the matter? Board meeting, nine o'clock. No doubt cause to have the wind ripped from my sails again. Tom, you're the best doctor they have. That's mine! Er, boxes, loft? I haven't forgotten. I just want to go through them first, sort out what to keep and... what to take to the charity shop. Can't Freddy help you? No. Your mother would turn in her grave if she thought you two had fallen out again. Even with the full might of the US and the UN gearing up for war, General Lucian remains defiant. And with only three hours left of this latest deadline, the world is holding its breath. Here we go again. We need some hope. Yeah, buy a lottery ticket and give it lots of hope. See what happens. Come. What's the use anyway? We can't change anything. Is it my lucky tie? I thought you didn't believe in luck, or hope? You all right? I was hoping this might cheer you up. Oh, my God! Finally. Pregnancy. Nappies. Can we really go through all that again? This is our new start, our new hope. I'm going to be a father again. I've got to go. I know, I know. You'll be fine. What would I do without you, eh? Someone's looking happy this morning. Anything to tell me? Walk this way. That's fantastic. Oh, Jenny, I really needed this. I know. Then why the sad face? It's Tom. He's really struggling. I just pray this gets him back on track. Stay close, work through it. All right, that's enough, you lots. Good morning, children. Good morning, Mrs. Dunn. So, God told Noah to build an ark in preparation for a catastrophic flood. He then put two of every animal and led them into the ark with enough food to survive. Once the ark set sail, it rained nonstop for 40 days and 40 nights. The land was flooded for 150 days and every living thing was washed away. God killed the unicorns? Oh, well, I think God just wants to get rid of all the bad things, Sally, so that everyone would be okay. I guess the unicorns just missed the boat, I'm afraid. But I think the story of Noah's Ark is really about getting a second chance, starting afresh. Two years, eh? Time goes so quickly. - Hello, Father Robert. - Hello, Tom. How are you both holding out? Mandy's pregnant again. Congratulations, that's wonderful. I'm sure your little angel's been watching over you. Tom, focus on your hopes, not your fears. You'll soon get used to it. It's great news. Hi, you've reached Mandy Dunn. I'm not here right now but if you leave a message, I will call you straight back, thanks. Mandy, it's me. Let's meet later. Obviously, we've got some serious planning, and some serious celebrating to do. ♪ The animals went in three by three, hurrah, hurrah ♪ ♪ The animals went in three by three, hurrah, hurrah ♪ ♪ The animals went in three by three ♪ ♪ The wasp, the ant, ♪ ♪ And the bumble bee ♪ ♪ And they all went into the ark ♪ Did you see that? See what? Oh, darling it's all right. Okay, can everybody get their drawing books out and draw the animals that Noah took into the Ark? Bombs have gotten a lot bigger since the days of Hiroshima, so it's vital that we keep a level head. You're late. Tie's a nice touch. Don't start. - You okay? - No. They've arrived and you weren't here. - Have they had the tour? - They don't want it. For God's sake! Tom. Harriet, not now, Dr. Tom is very busy this morning. It's all right. What's up, Harriet? You told me you'd fix that door at the end of the corridor. It's not safe. Harriet, it's fine. It doesn't have a lock because it's a fire door. I know, but anyone could get in. It's brand spanking new and can only be opened from the inside. Trust me, you're perfectly safe. - Come on. - You would say that. You're a man. Freeze! Jesus Christ Floyd, do you have to do that? Hey, Dr T, hey, on the news today, they said there's going to be another war. I'm sure there won't be. But I want to go to war, Dr T. I want to call the military. You know, be first in, I'm a trained assassin, Dr T. Floyd, remember, keep your head. Keep calm, right? Keep my head, while blowing others away. Yes, die, you terrorist pig. Jesus, he's hyper this morning. They all are. ♪ Here we are on baby gentle clap ♪ ♪ We start with a song and slap our lap ♪ ♪ We clap our little hands and we all jump up ♪ ♪ Baby come little chin ♪ There's certainly only one Floyd. ♪ Snap this tiny, we play ♪ Oh, for God's sake! Pretty chilling image you're drawing there, Sam. I think they wanted me to see it. Who? The angels. I've told you I'm clean. Sam, you're here to get better but if you keep taking this stuff... What are you, my Dad? No, I'm your doctor. And I want to help you. You can't help me. Nobody can. Do you believe in angels, Sam? I think the threat of war is getting everyone worked up. It's just another loud-mouthed terrorist state that'll end up getting their ass kicked. There won't be another war. Fine, but can you just make sure you win this war, please? Mandy, it's me. Let's meet later. Obviously, we've got some serious planning, and some serious celebrating, to do. Mr. Miller, wait. I still don't understand why you are shutting us down. We've done everything, new fire doors, new bathrooms, hell, we've even fixed the roof. Yes, without consulting me or the board. It was the right decision. Now we have a facility you and the council can be proud of. Oh really? I'm glad you were here to make such grand decisions. Who needs the board? I didn't mean it like that. No one would just make a decision. Gerry, wait. We improve people's lives here, the support, the community, don't shut us down. I'll change things, find ways to save more money. Look, I'm sorry, Tom. Everything has consequences and these are tough times. The transitional phase will need to start immediately, though. Transitional phase? The Grange will be their new home from now on. What about my staff? You'll all be offered a good redundancy package. But the patients! You can't save everyone, son. All right see you tomorrow. Hi hon, I'm going to work on a bit tonight so let's meet at the café in Cornwall Street, say eight o'clock? My wife saw it, my friends saw it, and now people are discussing it all over social media. But what exactly have they seen? Politicians, bus drivers, doctors and even some celebrities have seen what one African diplomat is calling, the vision of the apocalypse. Well, today, I'm here in Central London talking to people about what their experiences were. What did you see? Well, I was just walking across Westminster Bridge when suddenly, boom, fire and destruction, and I could feel the heat of this thing coming towards me. My sister who lives in Australia saw exactly the same thing. Look it wasn't a dream! But I've just spoken to someone who didn't see it. I wonder what it might have been because personally, I didn't see anything either. Maybe some were chosen over others, I don't know. Visions? I thought I imagined it. We all did. There was this fireball, it loomed over the city. Then it erupted into flames. A mushroom cloud clear as daylight. Smoke, fire everywhere. I tell you something bad is coming, really bad. I can feel it with every ounce of my being. This is ridiculous. How can we all have the same, no way. Stupid nonsense, everything's gonna be fine. What? What's wrong? You haven't heard? No what? There's a great big spaceship in the sky! Mandy, it's me. Listen I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but maybe we should get out of the city for a while. what the hell is that? Fire alarm? News has obviously got out that we're being shut down! Oh Christ. Get everyone out from downstairs. I'll clear up here, okay? Okay. Gotta go. Fire escape come on. Let's go. Excuse me. I told you it wasn't safe! What is it with you and locked doors? Floyd give me a hand. Come on hurry. - What's that? - Floyd. What the hell? Russian! It's got to be Russian! Russian? A Russian what? Go! What do you want? Russian... Good morning Mr Ambassador. The head of MI5 is here to see you. Leave my daughter alone! I'm sorry I didn't mean to let him in. The door was not locked. I unlocked it. I didn't mean to let him in. I didn't mean to let him in! Please don't. Don't. Please don't! Floyd? No! Floyd, it's me, Tom. Tom. Floyd what are you doing? My job! Tom. Tom. Get up Where are we? Come on. They're coming! What the hell is going on? I've found it! What are you doing? It's the antidote. - For what? - You don't remember? No. The city's been gassed. And that gas has turned everyone into the undead. She's done nothing wrong. Please, leave my daughter alone. What? Let her go you son of a bitch! Mandy? This is for what you did. Harriet, for God's sake, its me, Tom, your Doctor! He has to pay for what he did! Tom! Tom! Are you okay Tom? I've had better days. How did you escape? I don't remember. We just woke up on that cliff over there. This isn't home, is it? My head's bursting. Mine too. I was an assassin, wasn't I? You shot me and Harriet. We shared the same experiences. Yes of course the ambassador has spoke to MI5 and will be reporting to the Prime Minister shortly. Goodbye. How did you get in? Run. Floyd. What you doing? My job. Floyd, don't get angry. Keep your head calm. Stay calm. Where am I? I don't know, but this is all wrong. Sam, you've killed Sam. What have I done? I'm sorry Tom. I'm sorry. Listen, your ambassador is in so much trouble. You hear me? You wait till MI5 hears about this. I'm a trained assassin. Yeah? I'm a trained assassin. Trained assassin! Floyd? You didn't really want to kill anyone, did you? Of course not. I haven't always been ill you know. I haven't. I wanted to travel the world once. Do something important, like work for the UN or the Red Cross or... How do you feel now? I feel clear. You look different. If we want answers, that's where we're going to find them. Come on. Lets go. We're going on an adventure. Come on! Who are you? Get down! It's coming for us. Tom get down. Tom! Woah, what a shot! Let's just keep moving okay? Come on! Guys, do any of you remember the cinema complex? We all do. I don't believe it! Wow. It's amazing, isn't it? We're never alone, you know. There's always someone looking out for us. It's wonderful. Yeah. Yeah, that's her. Get her out before she causes another scene. Excuse me Miss, can I have a word with you please? Right! We told you not to come back here! Get off me! Gas has turned everyone in the city. Millions are now undead. Agghhh, come on! Tom! Tom! Tom, this is the only way we'll get through this! I told you. You don't need that shit. You're trying to get better, remember? Better? I'm ill. My bag, I haven't got my bag! Stay out of here you bitch or I'll call the police! I wish you were dead! I wish you were all dead! No. I don't need you anymore! We're never alone, you know. There's always someone looking out for us. Come on. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. Don't worry. You're safe now. I can help you. I can help you... I'm cured, fixed, call it what you want Tom, but my addiction is completely gone. They fixed you and Floyd? What kind of aliens are these? I am not climbing up there! Don't you want to get home? Home? I don't have a home! Are you alright Harriet? He has to pay for what he did! I wanted revenge all my life. I've hated every man that I've ever known. Because of him. I'll go. Harriet wait for me. Wait for me Harriet. Harriet? I'm your Daddy. My father, Billy McCoy. It's alright. You can trust me. Now, be a good girl and unlock the chain? It's important business. Harriet wait for me. Wait for me Harriet. Wait for me. I should... I should have listened. Billy. What are you doing here? Oh my god Billy, please. What are you doing? You. You had to tell them, didn't you? I didn't tell them anything. Please, let go of my daughter! - Your daughter? - Please! She's mine too! I told you to stay quiet. It's time to teach mummy a little lesson. Isn't it, mummy? No. Owwww! So Tom, we've all faced our demons, what about you? I'm sure Tom's perfect. No skeletons in your closet, eh? Sorry guys, you might have all seen the light, but I just want to get out of here. You are joking? Look, have faith. I will get us home. Somehow. We do have faith in you, Tom. But what aren't you telling us? Look, I give up with you lot! Listen, Tom. Tom. Something amazing has happened to me. Now I'm free. Here here! That's great guys, really poetic. But Floyd, you're a schizophrenic. Harriet, you have a narcissistic personality disorder. Samantha, you're a manic depressive. Look, now these are conditions that can be calmed or treated over time. But I'm sorry, they don't just disappear overnight. Now are you coming or not? I'm not sure Tom gets it yet. No! We're under attack! Guns? Thank you. I'm sorry Harriet. I forgive you. Just point and shoot. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You alright Sam? I'm fine. From now on, we stay together! There must be a control centre. Yeah? Then what? Home. Watch out! Watch out! Shoot them! Climb down that ridge! Come on Harriet! This way. This way! Tom help! Come on Sam, I'll cover you. Come on! They made it. So do you understand yet? What? Why we're here? It's obvious, isn't it? To get home? Tom! Why have you brought us here? Why have you brought us here, Tom? What? Come on, we're under attack. I am Kaleidoscope Man! Defender of the Earth! Half man, half robot. Dad! Get help, son. To them, he is the defender of the earth. Shall I get Mr. Robinson? No, Freddy, wait. But Dad said! I can do this. To us he is, "Kaleidoscope Man" I am Kaleidoscope Man. I am Kaleidoscope Man. I am Kaleidoscope Man. I am Kaleidoscope Man. Be spectacular. Be spectacular. Can you hear me? Yes. Where are we now? We're in the spaceship. The small ship put us here. Did I just dream all that...? We all did. But, it's true. We've been fixed. Fixed? We've been here less that 20 minutes. 20 minutes! It feels like days. I don't think we were brought here just to clear the skeletons from our closets. Why would they make us look back at our pasts? No, there was a reason. You're listening to Razorlight Radio broadcasting live from the heart of New York City. Well, what a day. US and UN troops have engaged General Lucian's forces and now Russia and China are threatening reprisals and to add to that, this mysterious thing has appeared in the sky. Some are calling it a visual propaganda trick, others a bad omen. Well, we should find out soon enough. NASA has just tweeted that the ISS will have a visual in the next few minutes. Maybe they can enlighten us on what the hell is going on up there. Station this is mission control Huston. Commander Phillburn, you should have a clear visual status any minute now. There's no line of sight yet. You really should be able to see it now. Hold your horses. What are we looking for? I guess that's what we're just about to find out. What is that? Object coming into view now. Report station. What's your visual? Come in Jeff. Jeff? Oh mother of god. And the sheer volume of traffic on the freeways has brought the city to a near standstill. Police are again warning people to stay in their homes. So to pick up: Stay in your homes folks. Was that New York? Jesus Christ. What's going on? It's like bloody "Independence Day," only for real. Just to confirm, New York has been attacked. Early reports say, a massive explosion in the heart of the city. Ok. I'm just hearing that Manhattan has gone. Manhattan has been destroyed. We're under attack! The Chinese Ambassador has tweeted that China is on full military alert. Iran, North Korea and Russia are yet to respond. Mandy it's me. Listen, I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but maybe we should get out of the city for a while. They're like, small independent ships. There's millions of them... Oh God! They're gun-ships. We've got to warn people. Please repeat. So many... Jeff, tell them. Jeff they're invading. Come on guys, what are you seeing? Each ship is fully loaded with heavy weaponry. They're invading. Repeat, they are invading! Roger that station. Standing by. Woe, destruction, ruin and decay. The worst is death. They've seen us. And death will have his day. Are they not following the Pacific Rim fault line? What? The San Andrea Fault! This can't be happening. North and South America are under attack. Massive explosions are being reported in Mexico City, Los Angeles and San Francisco. President Waterman has warned the governments of the world to brace themselves. The Prime Minister has announced that all measures will be taken to protect the towns and cities of our country. Clear the streets. Get these civilians off the streets. Come on! Clear the streets. Clear the streets. Jesus Christ. Fire fire fire Fall back! Take cover! Get back! Fall back! Air support, where the hell's the air support? There must be something we can do? I've got a phone signal! Incoming! Come on Mandy. Pick up, pick up. The United States has launched a defensive strike in response to the attacks. We're under attack. Help, if you're receiving this massage please send help. Mexico City, Los Angeles and Vancouver have been hit by massive explosions. - I'm trapped. - Help us please. We're under attack. I don't know what to do. Somebody tell me this is just another bad dream. Why? Why are they doing this? Many Casualties are being reported. All communication is now lost. Driver reverse reverse. Fall back! Reports are coming in of large explosions in Terran and Central Israel. Politicians on either side are threatening reprisals. Please, somebody answer. Hello. Freddy. It's me. Great timing as ever Tom! You all right? Yeah, apart from fending off an alien invasion. You must be over the moon. Oh shit, they're taking us. The attacks on New York were barbaric acts of terrorism. A retaliatory strike has been ordered - against General Lucian... - Wait a second. A nuclear device was driven into the heart of the city. New York was just the beginning! We will wipe the United States off the face of the planet! General Lucian announced that in response to the attack on his country, a nuclear strike has been ordered against the United States. Why didn't I see it before? Freddy. Let them take you. What? I've made some stupid mistakes. I know that. But you've got to listen to me now. Please, let them take you! But they're abducting everyone! Surely we have to hide. US patriot missiles were deployed but were unable to stop the rockets. They're not abducting us Freddy. Therefore, a strike is imminent. They're saving us. What? From who Tom? Who are they saving us from. General Lucian went on to say that his country had no choice. But to completely destroy North America. Ourselves. You've got to trust me Freddy. They're here to help. You sure? They'll never save everybody. Most people will be hiding by now. I know. It's really nice to hear from you. Hey, Mandy's pregnant. That's, that's really great news Tom. Is she with you? I... I don't know where she is. Tom? Don't be afraid. It's going to be alright. All these years I've been learning about the human condition. We can't be fixed. We have to watch the hard way by losing everything we've ever known. Freddy was right. The people still alive down there will be hiding. To frightened to come out of their homes. Someones got to tell them. Wait, what are you doing? It's alright. The people down there will be scared of you. You've got to tell them why you're taking them. Please! People of Earth, attention. People of Earth, attention. My name is Thomas Dunn. I'm a doctor from London. I was one of the first to be taken. I'm not a leader or a ruler or anything like that, I'm just a normal guy. But I know why the visitors are here. From up here we can see what happened. Terrorists have exploded nuclear bombs along the fault lines that run up through Mexico, America and Canada. This has set off a huge global response. Everyone's bombing everyone else, blaming everyone else. And this set off a massive chain reaction. Half of America has already gone. And it's spreading. We don't have long. I only speak English so please translate. These beings, they're here to help us. If you want to survive, you have to come out of your hiding places and let them take you. I'm afraid it's the end of the world and they're our only hope. What can one say on a night like this? Half of America has been destroyed! Aliens have appeared in our skies. I thought I should read you some text. But no. You deserve better. We, we have lost our way. Power and greed has ruined us. the boundaries that's we've created have made us prisoners in our own little worlds. even the color of our skin has made us enemies. But don't despair. We have been given a second chance. A new beginning. The misery we feel now is but the passing of the old times. But this day, our day of reckoning. It will define us! It's time to end our conflicts and fight for our futures. Fight for our happiness and prosperity. Fight for our love and dignity. Remember who you were and step forward into the new world. It's time. Surrender to the love of God. He will protect you now. He will protect all of us! Tom? Oh, thank God. Are you okay? I don't know. Tom, I saw you. You were incredible. Mandy, you need to let them take you too. The suns coming up. I didn't realize how beautiful the city looked at this time of the day. Mandy. Please. You are outside aren't you? Mandy. Look up at the moon. You're up there? Yes. I can't even get a signal in the flat. We're all on the ship. And I'm left behind. I love you so much. We gave it our all, didn't we? Yes, we did. I tried you know. You were the best. Mandy, please, you've got to let them take you. It's your only chance. It's alright my darling. I'm not alone anymore. I'm with Rebecca. I'll never be alone. I just wanted to say goodbye to her. Tom, I didn't think the ships are coming. Tom. They're angels Tom, they must be. They're keeping us alive until they find us a new home. But why, why save us? Who knows? And we mustn't lose hope, right? Hope.
