Plane number 17649 Calcutta to Dinjan arrive in Dinjan 10:32, request latest Calcutta weather. Hey, Elmer, get this crate unloaded. I got a date back in Calcutta. - Nice trip, Bill? - Yes, but you heard what I said, I'm in a hurry to get back to Calcutta. Hey, what happened to that eye? I, um, had a little accident, bumped into an elephant. Now get that gang of your moving, will yah? I'll bring you two bottle of whiskey next trip. All right, Bill. Hello, David. - Good morning, Mr. Cunningham. - Heard from Neale and Pedro? - They took off at Chongqing at 8:12. - With hangovers? They didn't say, they should be this side of the hump by now. I'll check them. Dinjan calling plane number 17650. Calling plane number 17650. What is your position? We're 20 minutes west of the pass, coming down to 9,000. Hey, where's Cunningham? Aren't you afraid with all them big mountains sticking up roundabouts? Yeah, we're so nervous we're biting each other's fingernails. Look, I'm heading back to Calcutta. Now don't forget my party Tuesday night, it's important. - See you then. - Okay. - Starboard H. - Drop cargo. - Drop the cargo. - Yes, sir. It's your job. Take your time, you'll get down there soon enough, get that stuff out of here. 17650 calling Dinjan. This is Dinjan, go ahead. Our right motor just conked out, dropping cargo. Keep contact. We're dropping, get that stuff out of there. - Where are you? - Over the Naga Hills. Wind up that garbage mill, will you? Doing the best I can, friend. They're awful pretty but I never thought I'd get to see them so close. We'll we made the field, how about sending up a mechanic and a crankshaft? I'll bring you a crankshaft. Steady. Steady! Hold it! Here he comes. Palmo, line him up. All right, slack away gently, boys. All right, Allen, lend a hand. Oh, you're here at last, what kept you? How do you like that for gratitude? I had an important date in Calcutta tonight and here I am bailing you two guys out again. Good evening, gentlemen, we brought some brand new equipment for you fellas to wreck. Why don't you fasten her together with string? The boys are hot an irritable tonight, Mac. - Take care of this for me, will you? - I'll take care of everything, you fellas just relax. Give me a cigarette, huh? Haven't been in any fights lately, huh? Where'd you get they eye? Oh, don't fret yourself, I'll take you into town, we'll cool off with a nice, long drink. Oh, no, you don't, there's a bunch of tea planters inside and they're tough hombres. Yeah and it's too hot to drag you out of any brawl tonight. Oh, no brawls, just peaceful talk. Come on, let's go. What do you say, Neale? All right, I could use a beer. We'll wash up, be right with you. Come on, Wang, let's yank down that motor. Oh, thanks. Well, here's your drink, what's so important? Well, before you get back to Calcutta, I wanted to tell you there's a reason for this party I'm giving. Yeah, who is she, tell us all about her. I'm, um, I'm going to get married. He's gonna get what? - He's gonna get married. - Why? Why? May sound weird to you but I'm in love. Look, we've been getting you out of jams for years but you can't do this to us. No, you're wrong this time. She's a swell girl, got a good family back in the states. - Lovely day. - Oh, yeah, beautiful. Well, she knows what kind of guys we are. She'd never want to bust us up. Wouldn't bust us up, huh? Don't be a fool, Bill. You've combed enough dames out of your hair to know what they want. Stability, to settle down. But if the three of us ever started for the front door you know exactly... Why don't you keep your feet under the table. Sorry, dear. Funny man, huh? You ought to get that smile kicked in. Excuse me a minute, fellas. - Now wait a minute you said... - He said enough all ready. Oh! Ugh! - Hey. - You want it too? Ugh, ugh. Lovely day. - Beautiful. - Where is he? Oh. All right, one punch Tammy, get up. That's a boy, come on. - Let me it him again. - Come on, come on, sit down. Here, cool off with a nice, long drink. See, you don't need a wife, you need a bodyguard. - Think you can fly? - Sure. I'm all right, look, I'm sorry about what happened. Yeah, you ought to be. I've still gotta tell you about Ginny. We're gonna see her, aren't we? I mean about the plans. Tuesday night there's the engagement party at the Chowgani. All right, we'll be there, now beat it, will yah? We've had enough of you for one night. Come on, smile you beautiful children, smile. Scram. I'll be waiting for you, don't forget. We'll, let's get our crate in the air, I could use a little Calcutta myself. - You got an opener? - What for? We forgot to finish our beer, remember? - I'll take care of that right now. - Now wait a minute. - Hello, Mac. - Hello, I'm glad to be back. - Hi, Pedro. - Hello, have you seen any sign of snow? Hello, beautiful, how are you? - Hello, Mary. - Fellas have any more trouble? Come on, do your duty... We never have trouble, do we? Not us. Neale, Chief wants to see you. Can't imagine what he wants with cargo strewn all over the hills. Where's Bill? I don't know. Probably in a high fog. I gotta see the chief, but you can make this out. I can't spell good enough... Lower and faster, baby, that's it. Ah, it's good to be home. Hi, you busy? Well, hello, Neale. Park yourself. Heard you had a nice time in Sadinga. You could lengthen that runway about 500 feet more and nobody would cry about it. I'm glad you got in. Have a cigarette. Yeah, thanks. Say, what's eating you? - Got bad new for you. - Yeah? Bill Cunningham. What about him? He was killed last night. - Crash? - Nope, here in town. He was murdered. - Who did it? - They don't know. They found him in a back alley, in the Bara Bazar. - How'd they get him? - Strangled. It was a posse, one of those thuggee nooses. It was still around his neck. Nothing about that girl he was gonna marry? No, I hadn't hear about that. I'm gonna take a couple of weeks off. The police can handle it, Neale. I'd kind of like to find out for myself and so would Pedro. Well, I'll need one of you to make that passenger flight to Chongqing tomorrow. After that, you're both clear. All right, Pedro will take it. I'll see you later then. - Neale? - Yeah? I know how you feel about this thing but if you find the guy, just work him over and give him over to the police. I'm short of pilots and I can't bail them out on a murder rap. That's his body, third one down. Not a very pleasant way to die, by the noose. No, it isn't. Put this around the neck from behind, huh? Yes, you were very close friends, weren't you? Lived at the same hotel? That's right. How long did you share the apartment with him? Ever since we moved from Chongqing. I see. - Well, is that enough? - Yeah. He said he'd be waiting for us. Come on. That was wonderful, Marina. Thank you, Paul. I see your American friends are arriving. Excuse me. - Lovely little voice. - Lovely. Thank you. No, don't get up. Hello, Marina. - You know about Bill? - Yeah. Your order, sir? Double vodka and two whiskeys please. I watched them take the table down this afternoon. It was all set for the party, flowers and everything. Bill wanted me to sing his favorite song. So I sang it anyway. Got any idea who did it? Who is the dame he's giving the party for? She isn't a dame. She's a beautiful girl, Ginny Moore, an American. They were here together last night planning the party. - Ever seen her before? - No. - Know where she lives? - Your hotel, the Imperial. How did you learn about Bill? When I saw them taking down the table. Who called off the party? I don't know, probably she did, Mr. Lasser gave the order. - Is he here? - Yes, in the gambling room or his office. - I'll be back in a few minutes. - Neale. I'm glad you're back. Marina. I hate to see a swell girl, like you, knock yourself out over Neale. He's the greatest guy in the world but when it comes to woman, he plays the field. - He'll never change. - I wouldn't want him to change. Why don't you forget about him? It's all right with me the way it is. Okay. Look, he's really upset about his, I better stick with him. Do you mind? Don't you tell me I'm wrong. I played roulette from Dinjan to Singapore. I tell you my hundred rupee marker was right here on number 17 and you raked it off. These people will bail me out. It's an outrage, I won't be cheated! Either you pay me or I demand a manager. I'm sorry, sir, there were only three markers, 16, 14 and a split on 15, 18. Well, I demand my money. What's the problem? The old story, Mr. Lasser. He claims to win with a marker made of thin air. How much was your marker? A hundred rupee. 3,500 rupees, I believe. Goodnight. I presume you know your way out. Gordon, Blake. - Like to see you a moment, Lasser. - Certainly. Mr. Gordon, Mr. Malik. - Mr. Blake. - Pleasure. These gentlemen are fliers on the Chongqing route. I was sorry to hear about your friend, I was talking to him last night planning a party. Yes, that's what we wanted to find out about. Who called it off? The lady he was with telephoned this morning, a Ms. Moore. - Do you know anything about her? - No. Ms. Virginia Moore? - Oh, you know her? - To my regret, no. But I thought I would like to when I walked across the lobby of The Imperial. She's a very beautiful woman, quite young. She would be a great adornment to any gentlemen. So I gather. Thanks for the information. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, gentlemen. Hello there. In early I see. Thanks. What's Virginia Moore's room number? You know, you chaps amaze me. You never seem to check in and you know the name of every new female in the place. - New? - She's only been here about three days. I suppose I might as well give it to you, you'd find out anyhow. The number is 312. Thanks. Hey, the crown looks a bit lopsided, where's Cunningham? - He isn't checking in. - Oh? Incidentally out. There's only one condition I take that flight tomorrow. - Yeah, what's that? - If you find out who did it, you lay off until I get back Thursday. Okay. Oh, thanks. Huh, M. Malik, ever seen him before? I've only seen him on one other trip a month ago. Well, he uses his own name anyway. Why are you so interested? Is he supposed to be somebody? No, I just want to marry him and get one of those rings he wears. Take it, I'll be right back. Glad to have you with us, Mr. Malik. Mr. Blake, you're my captain, huh? Yeah, I hope it doesn't worry you. No, nothing worries me in this world or the next. You're all very excellent airmen. Ah, I'll have to give you special service for that. You're going to Chongqing? Uh, you know, the stewardess just took the passenger list forward to you. You don't miss much. Perhaps a characteristic of my race. I sense much more than I see. Looks like I owe you a drink. It would be a pleasure, any time you drop by. My Chongqing office. Export, import minerals, Tandoor. You did want to know. Hm, two drinks. Did you wish to see me? - Are you Virginia Moore? - Yes. I'm Neale Gordon, Bill's friend. Oh, yes, won't you please come in? Thank you, I will. I was hoping you hear from you, Bill said he saw you on his last trip, that you were coming. I was up last night but you were out. I know, I'm terribly sorry. I couldn't stand it here alone thinking about him. I had to get out, I walked for hours, it was almost dawn before I even knew where I was. Cigarette? No, thank you. I'm so glad you're here. Bill always told me how close you two were. Yup. It's all my fault, if only I'd made him stay here with me instead of... Stay with you? After we got back from the Chowgani. We went into the bar for nightcap. Bill left the table and was gone about ten minutes. When he returned, I saw his face was white, he was furious about something. He said he had some business to attend to, that he'd see me in the morning. It was after two then. I tried to persuade him to wait until morning when he was calmer. I was afraid he might get into trouble, he was so angry. He just kissed me goodnight and left. It was the last night I saw him. What was he sore about? He wouldn't explain anything, I tried to get him to. Did you tell that to the police? No. No, I was afraid to talk to them until you or one of Bill's friends came that knew about us so I could talk it over with you and you could help me. If the police didn't know about you, how did you learn of his death so quickly? Why, it was on the morning broadcast. You aren't suspecting me of anything? I suspect anybody that had anything to do with him that I didn't know about. It's the only way I can find out. You wouldn't want to be an exception, would you? You don't think that I killed him? Did you? No, I didn't. I never would've done one thing in the world to cause him even a moment's unhappiness. I don't see how Bill could've ever thought of you as a friend. You have nothing in common, you're cold, sadistic, egotistical. Maybe, but I'm still alive. Will you please leave? Wouldn't want to harm him, huh? Then why'd you want to marry him? Will you leave or will I have to call the desk? You wanna call the desk? You aren't afraid of questioning, are you? I haven't anything to be afraid of, Mr. Gordon, from you or anyone else. Evidently, us getting married didn't appeal to you. That's right. - You don't believe in marriage. - No. You think it would've harmed him? It's like grounding a DC in the rain and letting it rust. You know what kind of a fella Bill was, why were you gonna marry him? Why does any woman want to marry? For several reasons, some of which I told Bill. - What were yours? - Because I thought he was the most wonderful man I've ever known. But you didn't love him, at least you didn't mention it. No, no I didn't mention it. I'm... I'm going to tell you something, Mr. Gordon, in the face of your suspicions, although I don't think you'll understand it. I wasn't exactly in love with him, I was devoted to him because he was so much in love with me. He was like a big, unruly kid but he loved me with all his heart and we would've been happy despite of what you think. Where'd you get this scabbed diamond? Bill gave it to me. Look, you put on a good act up until now. Let's get down to facts. What are you talking about? Bill never saved up enough dough in his life to give you that. As a matter of fact, he and I priced it at the baZar. There were two of them. They were the first carved diamonds we've ever seen and they cost 27,000 rupees each. Eight thousand bucks, what are you lying for? I said, Bill gave it to me. - Give it to me. - I will not. If this is yours, you'll get it back repaired. Savvy English? Savvy diamond like this? No, sorry. Do you savvy English? No, savvy. I'm looking for another diamond like this. Come on, brat. Who are you? Neale Gordon, China International. You're another one of those blessed young hellions. What have you been doing, robbing people? After a fashion, who are you? Mrs. Smith, I own the joint. What were you asking the boys. Trying to find out who bought this. One of your flying chums. - Remember what he looked like? - Big, good looking, brown eyed devil. I could've gone for him if I'd been 20 years younger. - Cunningham? - That's the sweetheart. - 27,000 rupees huh? - That's right. You darlings spend money like sailors ashore. Yeah, I suppose he came in here loaded down with bank notes and just piled it on the counter. No, he gave me a check, I got it out in the back somewhere. Do you mind if I see it? No. Isn't he a darling, my little Sinbad. Ming, give him a drink of beer. Yes, Madame, I have it waiting nice and cold. I don't know what you've got ants about but come along. - Have a slug. - Thanks. Sit down, take the weight off your feet. I'll do that. Here it is. That's his signature all right. But I'm afraid you're stuck, he never got near a bank with this much dough. Look, darling, believe me the money's in his account, I checked. The last time I got cheated was 25 years ago when my squirt of a husband ran out on our act with my bankroll and a blonde tightrope walker. Must've been better than my ballet. You'd never think I did ballet, would you? Mind if I call the bank? Help yourself. May I have the telephone number to the Empire Bank please? You know, you'd be an attractive guy if you didn't act as suspicious as a flee on a stuffed zebra. Yeah, well thanks. - Try ringing 823. - What's the matter with you? Trying to find out who killed Cunningham. Is that big kid dead? - Yeah. - I'd like to find that out myself. Hello, is Jim Wang there? Hello, Jim, it's Neale Gordon. Oh, Mr. Gordon. Cunningham's bank balance? For you, yes, just a moment. 35,600 rupees. No, he deposited a check for 24,000 the day before yesterday. Yes, it was a make out by Eric Lasser. Yeah, I know him. Well, thanks, Jim. Well, looks like you can collect. Sure. Why did you want to find out? What? Who killed him? Because he was a nice kid. Whoever did it ought to have his neck stretched. You know a lot more than you talk, don't you? Not about this. Well, if you find out anything, let me know at the Imperial, will you? - Sonny boy? - Yeah? Maybe I've got a weakness for rugged young guys, especially from New York and points west. I hate to see you poke your nose into trouble in this town. Why? Whatever is going on, it looks like the people play pretty rough. Well, I like it that way. I guess you do. Good luck. Thanks. Sir. I wish to apologize for my rudeness in speaking Chinese, I didn't know you. No savvy. How do you always know when I get here, Kim? Me know. You must have spies in the lobby or something. Man named Lasser call? - Nobody. - I left word for him to, let me know when he does, huh? - Missy here. - Missy who? Ms. Tanev in bathtub, cool off, hot day. Marina? - Neale? - Yeah. I took a swim. So I see. You know you ought to wear Pedro's robe, it wouldn't fit you so tight. Marina, what do you know about Lasser? Not much, how do you mean? Does he have any other business besides gambling? Not that I know of, he seems to be there at the club most of the time. Why? Oh, nothing. - Neale. - Hm? You haven't kissed me yet. It's not fun being in love with you. Kiss me again. I'd like to speak to Mr. Gordon please, I'm Ms. Moore. Yes, missy. Some missy Moore outside. - Missy who? - Missy Moore. Be right out. Missy come in please. Boss see you soon. Well, I didn't expect you to call on me. I assure you it will be very short. Fair enough, won't you sit down? No, thank you. I just thought I'd tell you I've been with the police and told them all I know. That seemed to be one of your main suspicions. It was. Who did you see, Kendricks? I ended up with him, yes, he's in charge of the case. Have he found out anything new? If he had he didn't confide in me. Oh, he just sat there and listened? He's an intelligent man. He's very intelligent and very smart. By the way, I owe you an apology. I had it repaired, if there's anything wrong with it you can get it fixed at the jewelry shop in the lobby. You found out I was telling the truth. Yeah, he bought it for you all right. Did he ever tell you where he got such a landfall? No. He didn't me either and that's not like him. Did he do any gambling after he got back? No, not that I know of. Oh, hello, Ms. Moore. It's nice to see you again. I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. Well, you didn't intrude, did she, Neale? Why, not at all. Marina, did you see Bill do any gambling at the Chowgani when he got back? No, I don't think he did. That settles that. Come on, I'll buy you two a drink. I can't, Neale, I have rehearsal before the show. - I've got to fly. - All right. Some other time. Goodbye. Goodbye, Ms. Moore, I hope you'll come to the club again. Thank you, goodbye. Would you like a drink? I think I would. Sir. Oh, two gin slings with ice please. - That all right with you? - Yes. I know it's very pleasant here, especially when one has returned from a long haul. You know, I never could quite believe it until now. What? That a woman could love a man and thoroughly hate him at the same time. I think it would be entirely possible in your case. Make an interesting life. You don't trust women one bit, do you? Do you? No. You know the Gerkes have the saving they've been kicking around for a number of years, "Man who trusts woman will walk on buckwheat in a pool." - What was she like? - Who? The girl you were in love with that walked off and left you holding that thought. A woman always wants to blame a guy's good judgement on a woman. I understand you telephoned me? That's right. Oh, Ms. Moore, you know Mr. Lasser of course. Yes, how do you do? How are you, Ms. Moore. Won't you sit down and have a drink? Thank you. Brandy and soda. I thought I'd drop in and find out what you had on your mind. I didn't expect such charming company. Neither did we. You finally found the lady. Found me? He was showing a bit of curiosity about you at the club. - You seemed to have solved his problem. - I think I have. Suppose we talk about you. Perhaps I can solve one too. We're wondering about a check you gave Cunningham for 24,000 rupees. 24,000... Oh yes, I remember, he had a run of luck the other night. Remember when? One day last week, whenever the check was dated. Friday. Ms. Moore doesn't remember him doing any gambling. I see. Were you with him last Friday? Well, there was one evening I didn't have dinner with him. It was Thursday. No, no, it was Friday, I'm sorry. Seven thousand dollars is quite a run of luck. It's funny you didn't mention it when I talked to you. Evidentially, you've never run a gambling house. I don't get it. It may seem like a big amount to you but it's a drop in the bucket to what crosses those tables. - You pay no attention to it, huh? - No. You just have someone write those big checks and sign your name. No, I sign them myself. I thought you two were friends of Cunningham's. That's right. You seem to think that I gave it to him for something beside gambling. Something illegal perhaps? Is it your theory that he was killed... My apologies, Ms. Moore, that he was killed over being mixed up with something crooked. Yes, what are yours? I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill, Mr. Gordon. I think you'll find, when the case is solved, that Cunningham was killed for whatever he had in his pockets. Thank you for the drink. Oh, Lass. The police found 312 rupees in his pockets. Then I am apparently wrong, Ms. Moore. You look afraid. I am. Don't be. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening, Blake. - Have a good flight? - Thank you, Neale's upstairs, huh? - You were here when he asked about Ms. Moore? - Yeah. He's dancing with her. Find the guy? No... oh, uh, Ms. Moore, Pedro Blake. - How do you do? - Hello, Pedro. I'm beginning to get it. What? Why Bill said he was keeping you under wraps. Come on you better have a drink. No, I can I only stay a minute. I got a date. What's the matter? Fine bloodhound I turned out to be. - Can I talk to you a minute? - Sure, go ahead. It's alright. I thought you didn't trust me. What happened? Remember that little Hindu we saw with glasses, the one with all the rings? - Yeah. - When I was taking off the next morning, he came tearing aboard... We had to hold the plane for him. I thought there was something funny about that, so I stuck my nose in the cabin and got talking to him. Said he was going to Chongqing, he had an import business there. He gave me his card. It's on the up-and-up, because I checked later. - What's so strange about that? - Nothing, except he didn't go to Chongqing. When I was gassing up at Quon Ming, he disappeared into thin air. It doesn't make sense. I'll say it does... He's been sitting up there all evening. Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute. - Ah, gentlemen. - Oh, Mr. Malik. Thought you were in Quon Ming... What are you doing here? Some Chinese friends happened to be flying down last night. I was sorry not to go on to Chongqing with you. Some unexpected business came up. Yeah. You two seem most interested in me, if I may say so. Well, you're a very interesting fellow. I didn't have a chance to buy you those drinks. - How about having them now? - I am sorry, no. In the future, perhaps. We'd like to talk to you. Gentlemen, you're interests are too many. You should concentrate on your flying. You're excellent flyers. You should live long and happy lives. If you'll excuse me? Good night. There he goes with that double-talk again. Why don't we get him outside and slap him up against a wall? Because we haven't got anything on him. He's in it up to his ears. Well if he is we'll pull him out. I'm going down to the table. Ah, you're busy enough. Besides, I got a date of my own. - Okay. - Neale. You're not falling for that dame are you? Why? Talking in front of her. Good... oh, and that reminds me. Take care of that for me, will ya? They always go through my pockets in my sleep. - What is it? - Star sapphire. A beauty... picked it up out of Dum Dum knocking around the Florida hangar. Somebody's gonna do an awful lot of squawking, but I don't know a thing. I'm gonna have me a ring too... See you later. - Kim, what does this Chinese writing mean? - Let me see. Right side one mean, how you say? Fatness is too much? Weigh? Yes, sir... center part mean how much a price you pay for diamond, sapphire, and rupee in Calcutta. Left side mean, how much big money can get you in China, Chongqing. You savvy, he big plans in everything in China. Get you hundred time profit. Sparkling huh? Yes, sir. Do I look like a pigeon, Kim? Flying aeroplane? Yes, sir. Give me the phone, please. Hello, would you get me the Dum Dum airport, please. Hello, this is Neale Gordon... What plane is leaving for Chongqing tomorrow? 17652, huh? Alright, thanks. Kim, I want you to phone every number in that book until you locate Mr. Blake. - Yes, sir. - Have him meet me at the hangar right away, huh? Yes, sir. Ahh! Francy! Pedro. What's the idea dragging me out of... - What's a matter with you? - Got the same working over Bill got. You mean one of them strangling cords? - The posse noose. - Who did it? I don't know, he got away. Oh fine, you got the guy right in your midst, you let him get away. - Come on, let's go find him. - No, nevermind. Let him pass the word around I was here. Well, it seems we've been smuggling a few million bucks over the hump with somebody and... And they don't want us to stop. - We've been what? - Have a look in that bag. That's something I found under the floorboards of 52 going out tomorrow. Wow! We better get this to the boss right away so he could radio check all the planes. Sure, then the guy will know we're on to his game, and stay undercover. Uh-uh, we're gonna it his way... Give me one of those broaches, I'll use it as bait. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to wrap the rest of the stuff up, and drive around till the bank opens, and put it in our safety deposit box. I'm gonna live with that empty bag until somebody comes out of their hole. That's far enough. It can be rather tiring for the arms. Perhaps you should sit on the bed. Well, you showed up sooner than I expected. - How is your friend at the airport? - Ah, you are a very rough man, Mr. Gordon. - A little rougher than Bill Cunningham, huh? - I'm afraid I do not understand. - Of course not. - Sit down please. You know, you can put that squirt gun away... You're liable to wake the hotel. You made the risk necessary, Mr. Gordon. Ha-ha, you and I are gonna sit down, have a nice long talk. Unfortunately nothing we could say would alter anything. I could not have you tell anyone who came for this bag. Well, it may surprise you, but I don't intend to. - No? - If you want another surprise, why don't you take a look inside? Who did you give them to? The police? If you killed me, I couldn't tell you, could I? That's better. Don't be a fool, Malik. Why do you think I've been risking my neck flying the hump? To get tired so I can sleep better? They pay good dough for it, cash, and I like it. I found a lot of it in that bag tonight. Or what'll pass for a lot of it. About $200,000 in gold, I believe. - That much? - You wouldn't know? I haven't seen this before. Well, that's fine, I'll just keep it and retire. Or give you half and stick with the airline. I'll let you cut me in from here on. You would like to have me believe that you haven't told the airline? And give them the evidence? Uh-uh. Those stones are the prettiest ones I've ever seen. And the people who have been sending those packages will be able to continue? That's right. I would have to wait for proof of that. Naturally. I have no connection to your friend's death, Mr. Gordon. I would have to wait for proof of that. You don't have much faith in people, do you? No. - Oh, Malik. - Yes? Don't let that night clerk spot you with that bag. - He saw me come in with it. - Thank you. Oh! - Ah, who is it? - I don't know. - He's dead. - We should send for the police right away. - Bad announcement. - Revolver and an automatic, sir. - He made no attempt to use them, eh? - No, sir, they were in his pockets. I see, and was rather careless then? Maybe he didn't expect it... somebody he knew. Quite possible... by the way, how did you happen to know his name? Blake had him on his last flight, he introduced me to him. Did either know he carries those guns? Well, I don't know why he would... He was just a merchant and exporter. I see... what a coincidence being found murdered on the same floor as your apartment. - I thought of that too. - Almost outside it, in fact. Yes, coming from the same direction when he was shot. And he hadn't been visiting you? I heard a shot, and ducked out to see what was up. That's true, Superintendent. This gentleman came out of his room just as I opened my door. I see... well, I won't detain you any longer. Thank you very much for your patience. Good night. - Superintendent. - Yes? Is there anything new on Cunningham? I hope we're not working at cross purposes, Mr Gordon. - Oh. - You seem to have been doing quite a bit of investigating yourself. Miss Moore. Her diamond pendant. Called the Empire bank regarding the sudden increase in Cunningham's account. We were interested in that ourselves till we found out he'd run at the tables. - Did he? - Last Friday. Had an operative with the Chowgani for a week. Any evidence to close the gambling... You saw Cunningham's round of luck. - It seems I'm on the wrong track. - Perhaps How'd you get your face scratched? - Shaving. - Without a doubt. Well If you find anything worth acting on perhaps you better let me know. - You'll be in on it. - I plan to be. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. And Gordon. You didn't kill Malik? - No. - No. It's not in the best of taste, but it's very valuable. Where's the rest of it? Pedro should have it stowed away in our safety deposit box by now. - Coffee? - No, thanks. Neale, you can't get away with it. - They'll kill you. - Maybe, maybe not. You're risking Pedro's life too you know. He likes it that way... Now you quit worrying about it. I don't worry about anybody. That's good, because it's beginning to add up, and I wouldn't want you to get gray-headed. Add up how? Well, we found out why Bill got it, and why it happened on that last trip. Because he didn't go to China. He dumped his freight at Dinjan, brought us a crankshaft, and came back here. They had to get the stuff off and put it on the plane that was going through. The only thing that doesn't add up was that he found out about it here in the hotel. Got called away while he and Virginia were having a drink. Somebody told him who. Didn't say anything to her when he left... why? He probably didn't want to get her grey headed. Yeah, maybe. When did it get to be Virginia? Since yesterday... I don't like to be formal. No. But you will be when you get laid out beside that nice little Hindu playmate. You're mad to go on with it, Neale. I suppose you'd rather I forget about Bill and go back to flying? Anyway, I can send pretty flowers. I'll get it. Hello... yeah, this is Neale Gordon. What? Yeah, well she'll be right up. - What's a matter, Neale? - I don't know. It's the night clerk, he want's me to come to Virginia's room... something's wrong. - You wanna come with me? - Yes. Thanks. - Hey, what's happened? - Have a look... someone ransacked the apartment thoroughly and doesn't care who knows it. - Do you know who did it? - No. - Where's Ms. Moore? - Seems to have disappeared. She didn't phone for breakfast. The cleaning boy found it this way. When did you see her last? When I brought her up from the dance. Oh, does she dance well? - Not bad. Has the bed been slept in? - No I'm glad you asked that question. - Certainly didn't miss much. Did she seem troubled too? - Say anything that might explain it? - No. It might be robbery... her diamond pendant. - All right, Arthur, you better call the police. - For the murder last night. They might as well move over here and take rooms. The manager's going to get into an awful flap. - Neale. - Yeah. Are you falling for her? I don't know, why? You have the symptoms. - You think so. - Well, things happen that way. Looks as if we'd better find her. You're really an awfully nice girl. Whoever searched the place, it looks like a woman. - Why? - The neat pile of clothes. A man usually doesn't take so much trouble with dainty silk lace things. Maybe you've got something there. Hello, sonny boy, I'm glad to see you... Come on, sit down. Only you gotta wait till a female gets her war paint on. You get down to cases much faster without it. Aren't you right? You know I love you. - They say you have it. - They don't speak English either, huh? No, they really don't... Now come on, what's on your mind? - You phoned me. - Yes, I got worried that you were getting in too deep. I dropped in The Imperial for a drink last night, and I saw one of Malik's men hanging around. I found out he was waiting for you to come back, so he could put the tail on you. - The idea me wanting to warn you - What do you mean? I should've warned Malik. You said you played rough... you certainly do. - How? - You killed him. - Not me. - No? - So, you were at The Imperial last night? - Yes. Is this what you were looking for? We'll finish later, girls. After you ransacked Virginia Moore's room, what did you do with her? Look, sonny, you better pour yourself a drink... You're spinning like a top. I don't know this Moore dish, and I'm too fat to ransack rooms. And what this is supposed to be I...you tell me. Something I found under the floorboards of one of our planes among some other loot that was going to China. Well tell me you know about that. I began to suspect it when you told me about Cunningham. That It might be the airline. I told Malik so. But you didn't tell me. Now you wouldn't expect me to spoil his little play, as long as he was alive. He was trying to find out who was smuggling this stuff and how. He wanted to move in on it. You can't blame him for that, can you? But what has this Moore dish got to do with it? It's what I'm asking you. You don't think I'd be chump enough to hide the stuff in our room do you? She didn't have anything to do with it. Where is she? I certainly am a hellion. - Did I kill Malik too? - That's something I haven't quite figured out yet. But I will. No soap, sonny. Malik was my partner up until a year ago. We used to run stuff into China over the Burma Road till the Japs cut it. It was too slow after that, so I pulled out. Malik almost gave up himself three months ago. Until he got word there was some hot jewelry in Chongqing that he'd seen here the week before. The idea of anyone else doing it that fast burning into a henna rinse. That means the cops. Some gentlemen from the police department, madam. How do you do, gentlemen? Come right in... My, how handsome you look in your uniforms. What can I do for you today? - Mr. Gordon. - Yeah? - Will you come with us please? - For what? In connection with the murder of Mul Raj Malik. Well, well. I must give you the conventional warning that anything you say may be used in evidence against you. Ready, sir? Sure I socked him. How'd I know they were cops? When I come out a door and two guys jump on me, I take a pop at him first and save the explanations for later. - Mr. Gordon, sir. - Oh, come in please. - Over there. - Oh, it's you. Took the police force to find you, huh? I, uh, had to stow away that big breakfast all by myself. - Did you? - Yeah... where you been? I'll ask the questions, Mr. Blake. - You did fairly well last night, Gordon. - How? Explaining things away. - Well, why the murder charge? - It's a bit different today. I find that you, Blake, and Cunningham have quite a record for getting into trouble here in Calcutta. We're peace-loving guys... we only got into trouble yanking Cunningham out of it. You both took a leave of absence when you heard of his death. Why? To find his murderer? We just didn't feel like flying. Did you think Miss Moore had something to do with it? - With what? - His death. You went out of your way to meet her, took her for cocktails, took her dancing last night. A few hours later her room was found ransacked and she'd disappeared. Believe it or not, I don't know what happened to her. You and Blake joined Malik at his table in the hotel last night. You questioned him and a few hours later he was found murdered outside your room. I told you I didn't kill him. - And this isn't your gun? - No. Would you mind checking these figures with me? Colt .38 automatic. Serial number 444824. Barters and Duff Limited Sporting Goods, Calcutta. Colt 38 automatic, serial number 444824. "Purchased March 6th, 1941 by Neale Gordon." Yeah, I bought a gun. I didn't know this was it. Mine was stolen from my locker several months ago. - And that's how Malik got it? - I don't know how he got it? Then I'm afraid I'll have to detain you till you remember. - No use trying to cover up... - Will you keep out of this, will you? Don't get in a stew, I didn't kill him. You may as well get this straight, Superintendent. Gordon's trying to front for me. He knew that .38 the minute he saw it. Knew I kept it in my room. He gave it to me quite some time ago. And he knew I dated up Malik for a couple of drinks down at the dining room. - Then Malik was coming from your room? - Yes. - Why did he have your gun? - I loaned it to him. Said some hombre was out to get him and I told him his pea-shooter - wouldn't knock over a can of grease. - Who was he afraid of? I don't know, and you can lock me up till I remember. You admit then that you were the last person to see him alive? - Yes. - Are you aware of the seriousness of the charge? I'll let Gordon worry about that. Apparently it's you we have to detain. This officer will show you through the formalities. - Send me some cigarettes, Neale. - Yeah. You're free to go now. It seems that you're not to be the guest of His Majesty. - This time. - Well thanks. - Hello, Singh. - Lady will see you. - Do you wanna see me? - Ms. Moore says, "Please come." - Have you seen her? - Yes. Where is she? I will show you - Where is she now? - Hurry. Wait here, please. - Neale, it's so good to see you. - Well, it's good to see you. Who's place is this? Maria, a friend, I found she'd gone to Delhi. Well I'm glad, some friends. - You know, I thought you had been kidnapped. - I know, I was afraid to stay in the hotel. - Neale, you won't leave me, will ya? - No. Did you know somebody ransacked your room? - Yes, I was there when he came in. - He? Yes, I heard a key rattle in the living room door and I was in the bedroom putting some laundry away. - Oh it was you that put those lace things on the chair. -yes? They gave me a wrong lead. I thought he was trying to hide. A man had been killed downstairs and I-I was afraid he might kill me so I hid on the balcony. He started searching everywhere. I realized he wasn't just trying to get away it was something to do with me. I didn't dare stay there. I got away down the servant's stairs. Do you remember what he looked like? He was an Indian... tall, dark, very thin, hollow-cheeked, he was well dressed. That sounds like the guy that was trying to follow us here. - He didn't see you come in? - No. Why is he after me? Why did he search my room? Why did he shoot that man? I don't understand. Maybe it has something to do with me. You see, I found over a quarter million dollars worth of jewelry being smuggled on one of our planes. Perhaps he thinks I hid it with you. - Well, surely you turned it over to the police. - Uh-uh. Blake and I have it stalled in our safety deposit box where it's gonna stay until the guy running the show asks for it. Well, then it's you and Blake he's really after. Me maybe but not Blake, he's in jail. Neale, please. You can't go on with this - Something will happen to you. - What do you think I ought to do? Well, get the jewelry and give it to the police... Tell them all you know, I'll go with you. Uh-uh. - Neale. - Hm? I was afraid for myself, but I'm afraid for you too. Perhaps more than I should tell you. I tried to hate you but...Neale, please don't take any chances. You know, if I live too long, I might get too crazy about you. And after all those speeches I made. But, you wouldn't trust me. Does a guy have to trust a girl to fall for her? No. Don't leave me. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Neale. - Find any more corpses? Not that anybody's noticed, and I'm off to breakfast before they do. - Oh, where's Blake? - In jail, why? - Mail for him. - I'll take it. Oh, Graham? You asking "where's Blake?" The night he and I checked in you said "Where's Cunningham? Yes, sorry. - I didn't know. - Why not? It was on the morning broadcast. No, no, it wasn't. - Are you sure of that? - Yes, I listen to it every morning. That was Tuesday. Of course he hadn't shown up for a couple of nights but I didn't think anything of it. Couple of nights? He must have been off duty for a while, because he and Ms. Moore were in the bar until late Monday night. I would've seen them. Of course you can ask the bar boys but I'm sure. - Can you get them all together? - Certainly. Come on. - He wasn't in on the 9th. - You know what he looks like? All the boys remember him. He tipped well. Well, thanks. I've got a safety deposit key to his safe. - Neale? - Yeah. I was afraid... you shouldn't have gone to the hotel, it's too dangerous. I can understand. - What's that? - Laundry. You certainly take chances for a clean shirt. Oh my... You wanted it, there it is. I wanted you to give it to the police. You are going to? But not if you can help it Neale, what do you mean? You couldn't get into the safety deposit box. But you could sell me on the idea of getting into it. - And you'd go with me to get it. - Well, of course, I wanted you to be safe. Sure, and we go on from there, and I end up like Malik did. You know, I couldn't quite figure out how he could get killed with two guns in his pockets. He just wasn't expecting a woman. Neale, please don't say that... You can't believe that I had... I don't believe it, I know it. Must've been quite a shock to you when you picked up that bag and it was empty. It meant you had to see me again, didn't it? Neale, what are you trying to say? I didn't do anything. You've got to believe me. I love you, you know that. You're pretty hard to resist. Then you do believe? You really got under my skin. You're beautiful. With that sweet, innocent face, I was beginning to believe all those lies about the morning broadcast. About you and Bill and the bar at the hotel. And he found out about the smuggling. But we were in the bar. Uh-uh. I checked with the bar boys. That's one thing that didn't make sense. Who killed Bill? You and who else? Neale, you're mad. Those arms aren't strong enough to choke the life out of a man. Who did it? I don't know... I don't know anything about it. Come on, talk now will you? I know you think you're too beautiful to hit. Always count on that with guys when you've been shooting 'em down in cold blood. Come on. I've got to know. Who are you working with? Who did it? Want me to beat it out of you? - No, it was Eric. - Lasser? - Yeah. - Come on. I couldn't help Bill's death... You've got to believe me. I tried to break up with Eric long before I met him, but I couldn't get out, it was part of it. To give the pilots pleasant dreams, and have them tell you if anything went wrong. But, I didn't mean to hurt Bill, anyone. That night after the Chowgani, Bill wanted to drive to the airport and pick up his briefcase and some clothes he left. I didn't know Eric was there. We caught him and an Indian putting a shipment in one of the planes. - I had to stop Bill. - How? Hold a gun on him? Yes, I couldn't let him warn anyone. I didn't know what to do... I didn't think Eric would kill him. - You didn't think so? - No, it's the truth. I couldn't go on after that... I broke with Eric. That's why I was afraid when you said someone tried to follow you. Stop your crying... go on talking. I can't, the mascara's hurting my eyes. I have to get a handkerchief. Funny, your mascara didn't bother you before. Give me that gun. - Give me that gun! - He has a temper. Drop that gun. Put up your hands... drop it. She always had a temper. You two shouldn't fight over something that doesn't belong to you. What women will do for jewelry. Virginia, you're an intelligent girl. You shouldn't have tried to run out on me. Not even for all this. Better not leave this around for ya. What are you doing? Give me the police department. You know Kendricks is gonna be awfully disappointed I only have one of you. You wouldn't tell him. You wouldn't let him arrest me. You know how I feel about you. With all those guns lying around in drawers? Someday it might catch up with me, and I don't think I'd get much sleep thinking about it. Superintendent Kendricks please. And there's Malik. You'll have to explain about that last. He's dead, they won't believe me. You said you were crazy about me. Not that much. Hello, Kendricks... Neale Gordon. Well, you can let Blake out of jail. Yeah. Lasser and Miss Moore. 39 Beretta. Yeah, we'll be here. Well, I think you better get dressed. I might get out through the window. Uh-uh. And I must warn you that anything you say may be used as evidence against you. - Do you understand? - Yes. Ms. Moore. And you're going to let him take me? I have to. I would've hated to have killed you. Ms. Moore. Here's the extra shirts you forgot to pack. Give Pedro the tamales. I'm glad to get you back in the air. Still keeping score. But no grey hairs. You're a lot safer tangling with mountains than with women. You're an awfully swell gal.
