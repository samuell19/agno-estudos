(dramatic orchestral music) (birds chirping) (water purling) (gentle orchestral music) - [Victor] Elizabeth and I were deeply in love. We planned to be married shortly. Then, one tragic clay, we were by a lake with my brother, William. - Come on, Victor! - I'm coming, William. William! (splashing) (dramatic music) William! (dramatic music) (splashing) He's drowning! - "I am the resurrection and the life," said the Lord. "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, "yet shall he live." We meet today to commend the soul of young William, brother of Victor Frankenstein. To him and his devoted guardians, the Scriptures offer the eternal message. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. In His will is our peace. We will... We will now join together in prayer. Our Father... (birds chirping) - [Elizabeth] Victor. - Death, peace, God's will. And all of us listening with pious faces. Why God's will? Any fool with a sword or gun can give death. Why can't we give life? - But we can. One day, if God blesses us, when we're man and wife, He... - So can a pair of animals. Life out of life. That's no miracle. Why can't I raise life out of death? Out of my brother's corpse? - That's how Satan tempted our Lord. - If Satan could teach me how to make William alive again, I'd gladly become his pupil. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, forgive me. - Oh, no, please, sir. - You're still hard at it, I see. Elizabeth tells me you want to go back to the hospital and do some more studying. - Have you any objection, sir? - Oh, no, my dear boy, none at all, no. I was just wondering, now that you're a fully fledged doctor, I thought you might like to start a practice. I'd be only too happy to help. - Well, that's very kind of you, sir. But there's something I must try to find out first. I can't even define it, exactly. - Well, don't forget, there's always help available, should you need it. - Oh, don't think I'm ungrateful, sir. You've been better than any genuine father could have been. To both William and me. - That's very kind of you, Victor. Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodbye, Victor. We shall miss you. (birds chirping) - Elizabeth, my clearest girl, I... I know that lately I must've seemed unkind, but it was just because... - There's no need to explain anything. I understand. - I hope you do. Sometimes I don't understand myself. But I love you. Believe that. Always. (dramatic orchestral music) - I don't mean to be presumptuous, sir, but you look extremely depressed. As a stranger, I have no right to say this to you. - I'm more than depressed, sir. My younger brother, William, was drowned just recently. - [Man] Oh. - He was only 16. (man groans) - Oh, looks like an accident. ' [Man] Stop. Stop, please. Can you help us? - What happened? - His arm was caught in the mill. It happened in a blink of an eyelid. - Well, what do you expect us to do about it, my good man? - We're taking him to the hospital. Come on. Make way. - Gently. - [Victor] Drive on! (horse neighing) - Upon my word, sir, you presume upon my good nature. I have an urgent appointment. - This man is in more of a hurry than you are, sir. Besides, the hospital was my destination, anyway. (man groans) Come on. (man groans) - Bring him slowly. (man groans) Gently, gentlY- (man groans) - Oh, Dr. Frankenstein, it's a pleasure to see your face again. We were told that you were coming back to pursue your studies. - Oh, yeah. You look blooming, as usual, Mrs. MacGregor. - Oh, thank you. - Is the surgery occupied? - Oh, yes, the new doctor's in there. Dr. Clerval, yes. He's a strange one. - Easy, easy, lad. You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. - You're all right, right? (man mumbles) (man groans) - Gently. (man groans) - God. - Uh-huh, yeah, yeah. Huh. Easy. That arm is beautiful. (man groans) - Well, surely there's no hope of saving it, is there? Or don't you agree? - Oh, certainly I agree. But you were the first to say that. Remember that. - Well, I suppose you want to begin. Can I help? My name's Dr. Frankenstein. - Yeah, I know who you are. Take care of his pulse. Did you give him anything? - Indeed, we did, Doctor. I doubt if he knows where he is. - Oh, God. - Much less what he's here for. - Well, give him another. - Ah, sure, it's only wasting good liquor. - You bring me that. Be ready to hold him when I tell you. - Yes, ready we are, Doctor. - God, God. - How's his pulse? - Strong enough. - Good. (man groans) I've heard a lot about you, Frankenstein. The nurses find you entirely charming. Quite the opposite of me, in fact. (man groans) Here. All right, hold him tight. - Yeah. (man screams) - I'll match myself for speed against any sawbones in the land. You also have an excellent bedside manner, I'm told. How's our patient? - He'll be all right, I think. - Yeah, within a month he'll be bragging to the girls he lost his arm at Waterloo. Oh, be a good fellow and beg a bed from Mrs. MacGregor, will you? I'm distinctly unpopular in that neighborhood. (man groans) He's coming around, you better give him another. (man groans) - [Victor] He's got his bed. - [Henri] Get pressure on there. Keep it on. - How much do we owe you, Doctor? - What's left in the bottle. - Come on. (man groans) - Tell me, frankly, what did you think when you first saw me just now? Did you not say to yourself, "What can he be doing here "hacking the limbs off plowboys?" And did you not think, "Now, there... "There is someone of a different breed." - Oh, yes, I thought maybe... - Yes, I bet you did. Perhaps you even thought, "Now, there's someone whose life has some "great purpose in it." Why aren't you making your fortune in London, feeling the pulses of rich old ladies? - I'm not interested in that. I want to learn. - Learn? (chuckles) Here? Oh, the professors here, they're afraid to venture beyond what their obsolete books have taught them. A new era in science is beginning. There are signposts everywhere pointing the way. But they daren't go forward. The new science offers power. And power terrifies them. - What kind of power? - Power over death. - Power over death? - Yeah. You won't learn any of that from your esteemed professors. I talk too much. It's seldom I meet a kindred spirit. - I wish you'd go on all night. - Some other time. I feel confoundedly tired. When I work here, they let me sleep upstairs. (groans) IVIY right-hand pocket. (Qroans) Oh. Oh, that's better. - [Victor] Don't move. - It's my own fault, I keep forgetting that I'm not supposed to exert myself. I'm supposed to take life very easily. - [Victor] Come, you should lie down. - No, no, no, I shall be all right in a moment. Where is my bag? Ah, the secret's out. (Henri groans) I've been waiting weeks for a good sturdy limb like that one. And when you agreed to amputate, you gave me a clear conscience. I still have some professional ethics, you see. No doubt, you're... You're wondering what I want it for, aren't you? Suppose I tell you that I need it to... To brush up on my anatomy? - I should still be wondering. - Yeah, well, that's... That's your privilege. Goodnight, Frankenstein. - [Victor] Aren't you going to stay here tonight? - [Henri] No, not tonight or any other night, if I can help it. I shall be working elsewhere. (dramatic orchestral music) (priest speaking in foreign language) (Henri prays in foreign language) ' Finally! Where have you been all these weeks? (Henri shushes) I've looked everywhere for you. - [Henri] Yes, I knew you would. - I couldn't forget our talk. You were right about the professors. They are afraid. I've been near to desperation sometimes. Then I'd come in here and sit for hours, half-wishing I could exchange my knowledge for their faith. (bell rings) Just believe as they do, blindly. (bell rings) - Why shouldn't you believe? - That wine can become blood? That bread can become living flesh? - That life can be brought forth from the lifeless. Why not? (Henri prays in foreign language) - You believe that? - Yes, I believe that. Not blindly, though. I believe because I know. - [Victor] Clerval, what is it you know? - Why should I tell you? Give me one good reason. - Because you're the signpost. If I go back now, I think I shall go mad. No, I suppose there is no good reason why you should tell me. - Come with me. This place stood empty for years until I discovered it. It's supposed to be haunted, so it's cheap. (bird squeaks) - I've never seen anything like that before. - That's hardly surprising, as I invented it. - But how is the power generated? - Watch me every instant. Imagine I'm a shopkeeper you suspect of cheating. Now then. This has been specially prepared with chemicals. I'll explain what they are later. Now, is it dead? - Aren't you sure? - Are you sure? - Certain. - Great. It seems that science must always begin by imitating the tricks we play with children. Except this is not a trick. (electricity buzzing) (Henri groans) Oh, come on. Oh, there's not much one can do with insects, I'm afraid. They only live for a couple of hours. You come with me, I'll show you something really interesting. You recognize it? Look at the flesh. It's as healthy as yours. Touch it. Go on, touch it. - It's warm. - Well, that's hardly surprising. It's been alive for more than a month. It knows you! - Get it off! - So, it has quite a will of its own. - This is a miracle. - Ah, it's a first step. You asked me how the power for my battery was generated. This is merely a toy, of course. Bringing that arm to life is the utmost it could accomplish. Before I go further, I need to finish this. (dramatic orchestral music) Building all this is quite beyond me now, as I've learned to my cost. I've been struggling with it for years. - I don't understand. "Uh? Uh, you know the story of Prometheus? He brought down fire from the heavens. Well, I brought down power. Power from the sun. It's power from the sun that gives life to the earth. To all of us. Now, using that power, I will create a living, breathing man. No, more than a man, the first of a new race. But I need your help, Victor. - No. - You're afraid. I was afraid at first. It's the way we've been brought up. We've been brought up to fear, to fear the punishment of the gods. But Prometheus defied them. - And they punished him. - He scorned their punishment. So has every other hero who's stolen secrets from nature to give to mankind. Victor, you and I are almost strangers, but I can read your heart. I know we can work together. As you've seen, I'm subject to these wretched weaknesses. I'm helpless without your strength. All this must be finished quickly. The spring will soon be here and with it the sunshine. If you refuse me, you will never forgive yourself. - What if I fail you? - Fail? That is a word that I shall teach you to forget. Will you join the brotherhood of Prometheus? Will you defy the gods? - I defy them. (gentle orchestral music) - No, we have to make it smoother. Down, down. (dramatic orchestral music) - What's that you're doing? - Creating my own eclipse. Take a look. The furnace of life. - [Victor] All that power! - [Henri] We can't use too much energy, or we could blow this whole building apart. - It's terrifying. - Not if you know how to make it obey you. (dramatic orchestral music) - Marry him. You know your father and I approve. - He hasn't spoken of it since William died. - Then speak of it yourself. After all, this is no ordinary engagement, he's so much one of the family. - And under such an obligation to you both for his education, how could he dare refuse me? - Elizabeth, please speak to him. - Forgive me, Mama, it would be wrong to speak to him now. Something has come between us. But I have faith that it will pass. Trust me, I shall be bold enough when the time comes. (people murmuring) - Thank you, ma'am. - [Elizabeth] Is Dr. Frankenstein at home? - Yes, he's at home, but... - [Elizabeth] Then, uh, could I see him, please? - Oh, I'm sorry, dearie, that's forbidden. - Do be so kind as to tell Dr. Frankenstein that Miss Fanschawe desires to speak with him. - Uh, Dr. Victor does know you, doesn't he? - I am his fiancee. _ Qh! Oh, I beg your pardon, miss, I'm sure. Won't you step inside? I'll get the doctor. ' [Henri] Yes? - It's a lady. To see Dr. Victor. - [Henri] Tell her to go to hell. - She says she's his fiancee. - Elizabeth! When did you get here? Is your mother with you? Why didn't you let me know you were coming? - Hello. Oh. I arrived an hour ago. I'm staying in London. Oh, Mama isn't with me. But you need not worry about the proprieties, I've brought one of the maids with me. And as for letting you know, if I had, I might've been told I was unwelcome. - Elizabeth, may I present Dr. Henri Clerval. Henri, this is Miss Fanshawe. - I'm afraid I'm interrupting your work. - Of course not. We're delighted to see you. Aren't we, Henri? We've been doing some research here. - What a charming room. Oh, this one is beautiful. - Henri, you're the expert, what's its name? - It's Brassolis astyra. If you'll excuse me, Miss Fanshawe, I have some business to attend to. - You won't stay and have tea with us? - [Henri] No. - When will you be back? - [Henri] I don't know. (gentle instrumental music) - I'm afraid he doesn't like me. - Oh, Henri, he's a... He's a bit of a recluse. - Dearest, you look so pale and tired. Have you been overworking? - Perhaps, I haven't noticed. - At any rate, you were too busy to write me a single letter. - That was thoughtless of me. Oh, Elizabeth, I have been so happy. In the olden days, I was plodding along in the footsteps of others, but now... Now I feel like an explorer. - What exactly are these studies, Victor? - Oh, it's difficult to explain. - Well, can't you at least try? In simple language, of course, suitable to my sex. Or has Dr. Clerval bound you to secrecy with some terrible oath? - Don't! (gentle instrumental music) I'm sorry, dearest, the apparatus is very delicate. - Victor, one day your work will be part of my life. I shall share your hopes and your disappointments. You do still want that, don't you? - Oh, you know I do. And it is right that you shall know and approve of what I'm doing. ' Approve? - Yes. The work, the exploration. It's so novel, so daring. Many people who cling to the old notions would be shocked. - I refuse to be condemned for narrow-mindedness without even a trial. - Very well. But I shan't try to tell you in words. You shall have a demonstration. You shall see what no scientist in the world has yet seen, in this very room at seven o'clock this evening. (clock bell ringing) (fire crackling) - Victor? Victor? Are you there? (clock ticking) (dramatic orchestral music) - I did it for you, Elizabeth. This is just the beginning. - It's unholy. - I wasn't expecting you. - So I see. - I decided that Elizabeth must be... - You decided?! I must speak to you alone. - Henri, listen. Look I can e... - Don't leave me alone with it. - There's nothing to be afraid of, Elizabeth. (dramatic music) - You betrayed me for that ignorant, empty-headed girl. - Henri, I am to blame, I know. I shouldn't have startled her like that. But if she has prejudices, it's just the fault of her education. Henri, I know I can trust her. She'll be a comrade to us. She'll inspire us in our work. (dramatic orchestral music) Henri, come and explain everything to her. You do it so much better than I. - Uh, appears our comrade has deserted us. - [Victor] Elizabeth! - Well, at least someone's found a use for Mrs. Blair's Bible. - [Victor] Wait! - The vengeance of the Almighty. - We must leave this place at once. - Elizabeth... - We'll forget what just happened, we'll never speak of it again. - Dearest, you're still upset. Let's talk this over. - I know when I'm in the presence of evil, deadly evil. - There is nothing evil about it! - That man will destroy you. Victor, you must choose. I'm waiting for your answer. - Why must I choose? - I see he has chosen for you. - Elizabeth. - If I were a man, I think I should kill him. (Henri clears throat) (bell tolling) - Oh, Miss Fanshawe, have you heard the news? Huh. (bell tolling) (panting) Dr. Victor! Dr. Clerval! Are you there? Oh, such terrible news. All of them struck dead in an instant. - An accident? How many? - Seven. Seven of them, there were. - Male or female? - Oh, such fine young lads. One minute they were singing and laughing at their work and the next the side of the quarry falls down and they're buried. - Well, were the... - And not one dug up alive. - Were the bodies much damaged? - [Mrs. Blair] Who knows? - Well, where are they? - They're using the stables as a temporary morgue. - Stables. Stables. (Henri mumbles) - It's enough to shake your faith in Divine Providence. - I'm sorry to hear you doubt the Divine Providence. We may not understand its workings, but we must have faith! Sometimes its blessings are disguised. - Yes, yes, we must have faith. - Yeah, well, it's between Goddard and Burgess for the legs. Goddard, I think. It's a pity his right arm's smashed. - How about Lewis, hmm? - Yeah, well, he's a fine specimen. Lewis for the arms. For the trunk and head, on the whole, I favor Laird. Torso's good. Ah, may need rebuilding. They all got knocked about pretty badly. - The face is beautiful. - Yeah. When we finish with him, his own mother won't know him. We shall do wonders with Laird. (taps body) - Beg your pardon, Doctor, I've got the coffins with me. If you're finished. - Yes, well, uh... I'm afraid there's nothing that we can do for them. Poor fellows. (people murmuring) (woman crying) - Doctor, I'm Colin Lewis's mother. God bless you, I know that you did all that you could. (people murmuring) - I feel like the lowest hypocrite! - Why shouldn't she bless you? We're giving her son a resurrection. - [John] Dr. Clerval. - I thought you were still away on your travels. - Aren't you going to present me to your friend, or should I say colleague? - Dr. Frankenstein, Dr. Polidori. And now if you will excuse us. - I understand perfectly. This terrible disaster, it must be keeping you very busy. Dr. Frankenstein, I'm sure we shall meet again. Henri, I shall continue to watch your career with the keenest interest. (people murmuring) - Was Dr. Polidori your teacher? - Yeah, we were colleagues for a short while. The man's impossible to work with. Vain, obstinate, half crazy, full of obsolete notions. You know, he once tried to hypnotize me? Didn't work. - Do you think he suspects anything of our plans? - On, Polidolly? He's no threat to us. Without me he's as helpless as a baby. (dramatic orchestral music) You're sure I can't help? - I've told you, as your doctor, I forbid it. You're the brains of this partnership. - Yeah, well, we better be quick. - What's the hurry? It's a perfect night for grave robbing. - Don't be so confoundedly cheerful. - Do you know I find I enjoy being a criminal? (dramatic orchestral music) Why don't you use any of Dr. Polidori's ideas? - He's still living in the Middle Ages. He knows something about preparing the materials. You know, he's afraid of electricity. He hides in the cupboard every time there's a thunderstorm. And he ridicules my idea of taking energy from the sun. The old fool. One day, every page of this will be framed in gold. It'll be exhibited in a great temple of science. It'll be the Bible of the new age. My name will be a household word. - I feel as if we were two generals the night before battle. - [Henri] Before victory. - [Victor] You're positive? - Yes. There is the living proof that our process works. Tomorrow morning, that whole body will be as perfect and unblemished as the flesh on that arm. - Those eyes will open. Those limbs will move. That brain will be alive. - Yes, Laird's brain. The brain of an ignorant peasant. - Well, it's a good healthy organ. Surely it can be educated. - Victor, I'd gladly give a year of my life if I could find a brain worthy of that body. - You certainly won't find one before tomorrow morning. I'll be back then. Try to get some rest. - You, too. Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses. Your Excellencies, my lords and ladies, my learned colleagues, I have the honor to present to you this unique scientific phenomenon of which I am the sole creator. Here he is, standing before you, alive and breathing. I present to you the second Adam. (banging on door) (door creaks) (dramatic music) It's impossible. It can't be. (dramatic music) (Qrunts) Must find the reason. (dramatic music) The process is reversing itself. (Pants) (dramatic music) (groans) (dramatic music) (glass crashes) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Henri. Henfi? My God. "The process is R..." R? Ready to begin. (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) Whatever may come of this, forgive me, Henri. No longer will our Adam have the brain of a peasant. (dramatic orchestral music) "My clearest Elizabeth. "Today, I am beginning a new experiment. "It could also be a very dangerous one, "for I am entering into the unknown. (dramatic orchestral music) "Should anything unforeseen happen to me, "perhaps someone may find this letter and give it to you. "Whatever happens, remember I have always loved you." (dramatic orchestral music) (machine whirring) (machine buzzing) (liquid gurgling) (machine sizzling) (machine whirring) (liquid gurgling) (machine whirring) (liquid gurgling) (machine whirring) (liquid gurgling) (machine whirring) (liquid gurgling) (machine whirring) (banging) (machine whirring) (machines exploding) (banging) (creature gasps) (creatures breathes deeply) (suspenseful instrumental music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Victor chuckles) (gentle orchestral music) We've done it, Henri. He's alive. Our perfect man. Our Adam. You are beautiful. (gentle orchestral music) - Beautiful. - Now you must rest. - Rest. - Yes. (dramatic orchestral music) - Rest in peace, Henri Clerval. "For the trumpet shall sound, "and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, "and we shall be changed. "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, "and this mortal must put on immortality. "Oh, death, where is thy sting? "Oh, grave, where is thy victory?" (bell tolling) - My deepest sympathY- At least it hasn't rained. A funeral in the rain is even sadder. I was afraid our beautiful weather wouldn't last. One must always make the most of the sunshine. Mustn't one? (bell tolling) (people murmuring) - [Victor] A friend of mine arrived unexpectedly. He's a stranger here. - Oh? - It's no use me introducing you, I'm afraid he doesn't speak our language. - Oh, poor lad. - I've asked him to stay with me a little while, if you have no objection. - Oh, any friend of yours, Dr. Victor. (chuckles) - Thank you. Just until he finds his feet. - His feet? MY' (suspenseful instrumental music) - I hope this gentleman feels rested after his journey. It was a terrible long one, I suppose. Our ways must seem very strange to him, I'm sure. And no doubt, the climate isn't what he's used to. Well, I hope you'll enjoy your food. I'll be back with the tray. - Watch me. Knife. Fork. Bravo! (both laugh) Window. - [Creature] Window. - [Victor] Bookcase. - Bookcase. - Very good. Bring me two books. (chiming music) Bring me a red book. (fire crackling) (Victor laughs) Appears to need much sleep. This is probably due to its condition of childhood. Also seems to have frequent nightmares. The coldness of the flesh is noticeable at all times, the body temperature being about 25 degrees lower than that of a normal human being. His powers of discrimination and reasoning are rapidly developing. Little or no physical change of any kind is to be expected. (bell tolling) (fire crackling) (door clicks open) (bell tolling) (fire crackling) - [Creature] Victor! (both laugh) - You startled me. Look, here they are. Ready for your debut. Made to your own measurements. Come and look. Look. Now you shall be the greatest dandy in town. - Victor. Beautiful. (operatic singing) (audience applauding) (people murmuring) - They're all wondering who you are. They think you must be some foreign prince. - Oh, Dr. Frankenstein. You do not remember me? I am Francoise DuVal, the bereft widow of the late Count DuVal. He was at least 40 years older than I. And he had so much to live for: 30 million francs. Now, what would a plain young woman like me do with such vulgar wealth? - I'm sure you'll think of something, Countess. - I was one time at the house of Sir Fanshawe and Lady. This must be your brother. Oh. How he has grown. I did not recognize him. - You are mistaken, madam. This is a friend of mine from a distant country. - Oh, will you not present him to me? - I'm afraid he speaks no English. - Beautiful. Only a few words. - That one word alone will get him far. (she speaks in foreign language) He... He knows no European language. (bell rings) (creature speaks in foreign language) - Excuse us. (she speaks in foreign language) (creature speaks in foreign language) - But his French is perfect. (bell rings) - Please excuse us. (people murmuring) - 3O million francs. (bell rings) (people murmuring) - What an evening. I must confess, just as we were about to go in, I came near to panic. But I should never have doubted you. You were magnificent. Your French was excellent. And the woman was delighted. When that woman took you for my brother, it was like an omen. William did not die in vain. You shall be his monument. You, who know nothing of greed or hatred, you shall teach us how to live. Everywhere you go, you shall bring happiness. Like that divine music. - Figaro. - Yes, like Figaro. (gentle instrumental music) - Rest. (gentle orchestral music) - "After this evening's success, "it seems foolish to delay public announcement. "I will show him to all of London "as soon as preparations are made." You do enough sleeping for two people. (dramatic orchestral music) (birds chirping) Ooh. (sighs) (hul115) (door clicks open) (hul115) (door clicks open) (door creaks) (dramatic orchestral music) The process is reversing itself. (liquid sizzling) - [Creature] Victor. - That's amazing. You found your way here. Why have you come? Is something the matter? Let me have a look at you. (Victor chuckles) (birds chirping) (people murmuring) (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Now, stand up there, my pretty, and I'll give you a drink of water. Ah. (knocking on door) Yes? What is it? I'm very busy. Oh! (chuckles) Oh, good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, my dear lady. Could I speak to you in private for a moment? - Uh, well, yes. Please come in. I was just watering my plants. - Of course you were. Madam, your lodgings have been highly recommended to me. I have a friend who's coming shortly from the continent. He's asked me to secure suitable rooms for him. - Oh, sir, I'm so sorry, but I have only one room to let, and it is presently occupied by a very charming gentleman. - My dear lady, if your tenant is out for the moment, perhaps you can show me the room? My friend isn't coming immediately. - Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't do that, sir. Dr. Frankenstein would be very angry if he ever found out. - I quite understand. Some other time, perhaps. (taps on hat) (suspenseful instrumental music) Now. (suspenseful instrumental music) Show me Dr. Frankenstein's room. - Yes, sir. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Hello. - Hello. (dramatic orchestral music) (creature laughs) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hello. - Hello. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh. The fools! Still playing with electricity. Clerval never learned. - I water my plants twice each day. The gardener said to do it only once. But my plants are much prettier than his. You see, I talk to my plants, and he doesn't. That's the trouble. That's the trouble. Oh, as I was saying, when I do have a vacancy, I'll be happy to let you know. Oh, I hope you understand why I can't show you the room now. - I understand perfectly. Some other time, perhaps. - Yes, sir. (bell ringing) What an elegant gentleman. (clock ticking) - "Three weeks have passed, "and I have kept him locked in the bedroom "under constant observation. "There is continuing enlargement "of frontal bone and mandibles, "usually occurring while he is asleep and having nightmares. "I can no longer hope the process will arrest itself." (clock ticking) (door clicks open) (clock ticking) - Victor. (dramatic orchestral music) Victor. Victor. (dramatic orchestral music) - How is he? - There's no improvement. - I wish you'd let me in there. The bed linen ought to be changed. - I've told you, it's infectious. - As if I cared. I've nursed my whole brood through the measles and the chicken pox and the mumps. - I have to remind you, Mrs. Blair, that I am a physician! - Figaro? - [Victor] No. - Figaro. - No. ' No? - Sit down and eat. Sit down, damn you! (clock ticking) - Victor. Sit down. Sit down, damn you! (clock ticking) Victor. Books. (clock ticking) (suspenseful orchestral music) Figaro. (door creaks) Victor. (clock ticking) Figaro! - Ah. - Figaro? - Ah. (she screams) - [Victor] Reverend? May I speak with you? - Is your business urgent? It's late. - [Victor] This concerns a man's life. - Prepare yourself with a small prayer to God. - I am not a believer. - Then you'll find it easier to tell me your problems after a short contemplation. (she pants) - Figaro. - You don't believe me. - If you believe what you've just told me, then I cannot help you. You should consult a doctor at once. - I am a doctor. - May God forgive you. (bell tolling) (dramatic music) - Fi... Fi... Figaro. (She groans) (dramatic orchestral music) (operatic singing) - [Victor] Wait! Come back. (operatic singing) - Figaro? - No. (operatic singing) Mrs. Blair is dead. "Here am I, imprisoned with this creature I have made. "I see no way out." No. (Victor sighs) (creature moans) - Ah. (creature whimpers) Victor! No. No. No. (creature sobs) No. Victor. (creature sobs) (dramatic music) No. (glass crashes) (creature pants) (creature whimpers) (creature grunts) (creature grunts) (dramatic music) - No. (creature grunts) (creature grunts) (dramatic music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Please, StOP! (dramatic orchestral music) (seagulls crying) Stop! (dramatic orchestral music) I... (dramatic orchestral music) (splashing) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (waves lapping) - [Announcer] Now, here are some of the highlights you will be seeing in part two. (gun fires) - [All] Ah! (people murmuring) (cheerful orchestral music) - Why have you come here today? Surely you must realize... - That today is your wedding clay. That's precisely why I chose it. - Why? I don't understand. - Listen... - This is our wedding night! - I promise I'll only be gone for a little while. You go straight to the cottage. I'll join you there as soon as I can. - But where are you going? - I can't explain it to you now. Trust me. - Can't you tell me anything? Is it going to be dangerous? - I can't tell you! Trust me. - I don't understand. (gentle violin music) - Does that please you? - Uh. (dramatic music) (woman screams) (dramatic music) (liquid sizzling) (servants chuckle) (dramatic music) - You're sure he won't feel anything? - Perhaps, just at the last, an instant of, uh, surprise. Uh-huh. (dramatic music) _ wake LIP! ' [John] Fool! (dramatic music) ' Agatha! No! ' Out! Get him out. - Go on, get out of here. (dramatic music) I His coat is so warm J' J' And if I don't hurt him J' J' He'll do me no harm J' Oh, you beautiful cat. (cat meows) - What are you doing? - Just playing a little game. (thunder rumbling) (waves rumbling) - No! (creature grunts) Someone! Help! Help! (intense orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - This awful nightmare began after the death of my brother, William Frankenstein. My fiancee Elizabeth did not fully understand the intensity of my feelings. Why can't I raise life out of death? Out of my brother's corpse? - That's how Satan tempted our Lord. - If Satan could teach me how to make William alive again, I'd gladly become his pupil. I returned to my medical studies in London. By a strange coincidence, I met Dr. Henri Clerval. - The new science offers power. And power terrifies them. - What kind of power? - Power over death. - [Victor] Later, Henri took me to an old, abandoned building. He showed me some astonishing experiments. - This is not a trick. (electricity buzzing) (dramatic music) (Henri groans) Oh, come on. - [Victor] He had created life by taking energy from the sun. - The furnace of life. - [Victor] All that power! Then there was an accident, and Henri and I decided that we could use parts of the corpses to make one complete body. As we were leaving I met Dr. Polidori, who was to play a terrifying part in my future. - I understand perfectly. This terrible disaster, it must be keeping you very busy. Dr. Frankenstein, I'm sure we shall meet again. Henry, I shall continue to watch your career with the keenest interest. - We made preparations to bring to life the body we had assembled. The night before we were to create our perfect human, Henri died, and I made a momentous decision. Whatever may come of this, forgive me, Henry. No longer will our Adam have the brain of a peasant. (dramatic instrumental music) Our great experiment was working, but the energy from the sun became uncontrollable. (machine buzzing) (machines exploding) (creature gasps) Our perfect man was a joy to behold. But soon a ghastly change began. (dramatic music) (creature laughs) I didn't want the creature to see what was happening. (dramatic music) As he became more grotesque, I began to reject it and realized that I was losing control of him. - Victor. Sit down. Sit down, damn you! - Then, one clay, he found out the truth. He decided to destroy himself. (creature grunting) (dramatic music) No! (creature grunts) And I thought it would be better for us both if he did. (dramatic orchestral music) But how was I to know that this would not kill him? (dramatic orchestral music) (splashing) (dramatic orchestral music) (waves lapping) (dramatic orchestral music) (seagulls crying) (dramatic orchestral music) (dog growling) - Quiet. Quiet, Toby. You must excuse him. I've never known him to behave like this. I've been trying to teach him that there's no such thing as a stranger. My name's Lacey. (cow mooing) You've got an unusual hand, sir. Uncommonly cold. Cold hand, warm heart, eh? Uncommonly powerful, too. The hand of a man who can get what he wants. I pride myself on knowing hands, but I can't quite make you out. If you'll permit me... (creature moans) Never mind. I'll respect your privacy. But I'd be grateful for your company. Please go with me. (cows mooing) My house is just beyond the trees. Agatha, my granddaughter, is at the market. (dog barks) There goes Toby. He thinks it's dinnertime. (chuckles) (cows mooing) Yeah. Oh, please come in. You needn't say a single word if you don't want to. (Lacey laughs) I'll talk enough for two. (cows mooing) (birds chirping) - Beautiful. - What? - Beautiful. - Oh, the flowers. Yes. Agatha and I get so much pleasure from them. Please, come in. So, your clothing's wet. Let me get you something dry. (birds chirping) (gentle violin music) (Lacey laughs) - Bravo. Bravo. ' What, again? You'll be the death of me. (laughs) (gentle violin music) (hooves beating the ground) The cart! Yes, that's them, I can hear them. Oh, yes. Yes, you wait till you see Agatha. You'll fall in love with her. They all do. Oh, how lovely, there you are. - [Felix] We sold all our wood and the vegetables and the eggs, and we've spent all the money. (Lacey laughs) - [Agatha] Tonight, Grandfather, I'm going to cook you the best supper you ever had. - [Lacey] We've a guest inside. Felix, I lent him some of your clothes. - There's no one here, Mr. Lacey. - What? How strange. Just when I thought I was gaining his confidence. Never mind, he'll be back. I invited him to dinner. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Agatha] "No man could bind him, no, not with chains." Is that right? - Yes, yes, that's the bit. Please, read on. - "No man could bind him, no, not with chains. "Because that he had often been bound with fetters "and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, "and the fetters broken in pieces, "neither could any man tame him. "But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him. "Jesus said unto him, 'Come out of the man, "'thou unclean spirit.' "And Jesus asked him, 'What is thy name?' "And he answered, saying, 'My name is Legion: "'for we are many."' - Thank you, Agatha. (dog growls) (dog barks) (dog growls) (dog barks) Friend, (dog barks) if you are there, come in. (dog barks) Oh, don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. (bird squeaking) I'm sure he has some great trouble or sickness. Strange. He seems vigorous enough. And yet I sense... (owl hooting) - "My name is Legion: for we are many." (owl hooting) (chuckles) (birds chirping) (cows mooing) (fire crackling) - Toby? Is that you? I'm going to take Felix his dinner. You coming with me? (door clicks open) (door clicks shut) (birds chirping) (dog barks) (birds chirping) (hooves beating the ground) (birds chirping) (dog barks) Hey, is that all you've done? You're lazy. Surely grandfather will hire someone else to do the chores. You're not to touch any of this until you've worked another hour at least. - You come here. (Agatha chuckles) - I've no time to waste with you. - You've got time for a kiss. - All right. (she moans) Have you no shame? Somebody might come by. - [Felix] Have you no shame? Somebody might come by. - That's enough, now. I've got work to do and so have you, you good-for-nothing. Toby, come on. TobY- (dog barks) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - [Felix] Goodbye, Mr. Lacey. Don't expect us back before sunset. ' [Lacey] Bye. Bye. (gentle orchestral music) - I hope our friend was listening. - Well, you did tie Toby up, didn't you? - Aye. - Well, you know what sharp ears Grandfather has. (gentle violin music) I think you're right. Grandfather's friend is in there with him. - When you hear me open the front door, you come in from here. - Oh, it's just like playing hide and seek. (gentle violin music) - Does that please you? - Uh. (dramatic music) (Agatha screams) (dramatic music) - Felix. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - Agatha. (dramatic music) (Agatha screams) (dramatic music) Agatha. (dramatic music) Agatha. Beautiful Agatha. (dramatic music) Rest. (dramatic music) Victor? - Victor isn't here. You've brought a friend with you, I see. - Agatha. - The whole village has heard about your little escapade. Don't worry, you'll be quite safe here. (John speaks in foreign language) I was expecting you to find your way here sooner or later. After all, this is your birthplace, isn't it? I should hate to stain the silk. Put her down there. .1' I remember, I remember the house where I was born J' I The little window where the sun J' I Kept peeping in at morn J' Now, let's take a look at her. - [Creature] Hmm. - I wasn't going to touch your precious Agatha. You may have the pleasure of doing that. Come on, let's see the extent of the damage. Come on I've no use for delicac, I particularly in monsters. Lift it up. (creature gasps) ' [John] Oh. - Victor. - You and I have a lot in common, my friend. You need his help, so do I. (speaks in foreign language) We shall have to try to persuade him. - Hmm. - She's going to rest. To rest in a nice, cool room. Very cool. That's what she likes. You want to rest, too. (clap hands) You're tired. - Victor? - Victor wants you to rest. Sit down. Sit down. That's better. N OW! I will ask you a question and you will answer me. Who made you? - Victor. - Bravo. It's a wise monster that knows its own father. He not only made you, he made a mess of you. Who are you? Who are you? - "My name is Legion: for we are many." - I would guess there are four of you, at least. Or could there be five? Does one of you know Polidori? (creature laughs) - Pollydolly? (creature laughs) Pollydolly? (laughs) - Henri? You know I hate that silly talk. Say something intelligible. - It's impossible. It can't be. Must find the reason. The process is reversing itself. - What poetic justice. You stole my secrets, and now Frankenstein has stolen your brain. You and your solar energy. You were such a clever fool. Fools are always in a hurry, so they take shortcuts. It was those shocks that made the process reverse itself. I could have told you they would. - For God's sake, help me, Polidori. - I can't help you, Henri. And God certainly won't. Why should He? He didn't make this miserable freak. But you're going to help me. We'll talk about that tomorrow. N OW! Wake up. You're hungry. You needn't be embarrassed. To them, we all look alike. (people murmuring) (people applauding) (cheerful orchestral music) (people applauding) (bells ringing) - [Man] May I ask you your name, sir? - Polidori. - Excuse me, sir, I don't find it here. - It would be odd if you did. - Get this monstrosity out of here. (bells ringing) (cheerful orchestral music) (people murmuring) - [Lady Fanschawe] Victor, this is the day I've dreamed of all my life. - That's very sweet of you, Mother. - [Lady Fanschawe] I'm so happy for you. (people murmuring) - Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Elizabeth. Darling, isn't it time you started to get ready? - I hope you're not going to turn into a nagging husband. I prefer to think you're impatient to be alone with me. (people murmuring) (cheerful orchestral music) - Why have you come here today? Surely you must realize... - That today is your wedding clay. That's precisely why I chose it. - Come this way. My answer is no, never! My experiment, as you call it, I shall regret that for as long as I live. I am guilty of that wretched creature's birth and death. - Your only crime, my dear sir, is inexperience. I can show you where you went wrong. Come, now, as a man of science, the prospect must tempt you. I can see that it does. - If you are misguided enough to go on with these researches, you must do so alone. (John sighs) - That is out of the question, alas. Oblige me by taking off my gloves. How gentle your hands are. The hands of a born surgeon. I have my battle scars like every old campaigner. You see. I got these long ago taking stupid risks with an unfamiliar chemical. The other wasn't quite destroyed. Even after all these years, I can hardly bring myself to look at it. Cheer up, Frankenstein, I'm not asking for pity, I'm merely demonstrating my need for an associate. May I trouble you once more? When Henry deserted me, I was helpless. I, who'd once been the greatest surgeon alive. Aren't these disguises ridiculous? Why do we take such pains to hide our ugly little secrets? Genfly. You are eager to rejoin your charming bride. Naturally. But I fear I must detain you for one more minute. There's someone in my carriage who is impatient to see you. Thank you, my dear colleague. (cheerful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) The mask was my servant's idea. An extra precaution. - Victor. - A touching reunion. Sit down. (dramatic music) It was risky bringing him here, especially since the murders. You hadn't heard? I'm not surprised. The victims were of no importance, a couple of rustics. Are you sure you won't change your mind about helping me? - Suppose I refuse? - Suppose I tell our friend to get out of the carriage and then suppose I drive off leaving you to explain him? Suppose we stop supposing and discuss our plans for the immediate future like sensible people? (horse neighs) (birds chirping) - [Man] Here they come. (people cheering) - Why? I don't understand. - Listen... - This is our wedding night! - I promise I'll only be gone for a little while. You go straight to the cottage. I'll join you there as soon as I can. - But where are you going? - I can't explain it to you now. Trust me. - Can't you tell me anything?! Is it going to be dangerous? - I can't tell you! Trust me. - I don't understand. (bell tolling) - Mrs. Frankenstein, I want you to know how very much I admire your courage and your understanding. (bell tolling) (gentle orchestral music) The day after you left so very abruptly, I moved in. As a matter of fact, I'd had my eye on this place for some time. Being a confirmed traveler, I've learned to make myself at home wherever I go. Some of these preparations are exceedingly volatile. They must be used within a few hours. - And you got them ready in advance? You were very sure of me, weren't you? - When our friend walked into my little spider's web, I said to myself, "I think Frankenstein can be persuaded." But when I read the announcement of your forthcoming marriage, I knew I'd got you. I've decided not to imitate the Almighty. Your Adam is hardly an inspiration, if I may say so. This time, we shall start with Eve. Would you be so kind? The head is his contribution. It has sentimental associations. Too bad there isn't more of her. This was all we could use. But your genius with the scalpel will make it the most beautiful head that England has ever seen. Remove that sheet. Violence may be unavoidable, but clumsiness is inexcusable. I had to send my servants to find the rest of the material. It's not a bad batch, but still it won't be easy. Still, if we should make a mess of her, our friend can have her, if she'll have him. Don't stand mooning there. I hate that silly mask. Get rid of it. It's worse than your ugly face. - Agatha. - You're a magnificent surgeon, sir. With a scalpel in your hand, you're an entirely different person. Do you realize that? And this morning you were cutting a wedding cake. - Can we start the process? - Listen to him, after six hours of surgery. - I won't rest until this is finished. - Are you so anxious to be off to your bride? You're much more eager to see this young lady, when she begins her new life. (bird squealing) (dramatic music) You have everything? Just a touch. (dramatic music) (liquid sizzling) (dramatic music) (liquid gurgling) (dramatic music) (John speaks in foreign language) (liquid purling) Now. (dramatic music) This will affect the skin and the hair. You'll see the difference. (dramatic music) Density? - [Victor] 187.3. - Uh-huh. Perfect. (dramatic music) (liquid gurgling) Protect your eyes. (speaks in foreign language) NQVV! (substance bursting) (dramatic music) (liquid gurgling) (dramatic music) Attention! ' Agatha! No! ' Out! Get him out. - Go on, get out of here. (dramatic music) (gentle orchestral music) - Well, what do you think of her? Or needn't I ask? - [Victor] She's an angel. - Angels are as COITII11OI1 3S sparrows, but this young lady is the first of her species. I think I shall call her Prima. - Prima. - Mrs. Frankenstein will accuse me of delaying you. ' 9h, yes, I better go. - Won't you say goodbye to Prima? After all, you are, so to speak, her godfather. Nobody could object to your kissing her. - Goodbye, Prima. What are your plans? - Uncertain, at present. - Excuse me, milady. The carriage is just coming up the drive, milady. - Goodness, the children! Aren't they very early? No, it's after five. When I'm with you, Doctor, I always lose track of the time. Elizabeth wrote me that she's expecting. - Oh. - Well, they've been gone four months. - Hello, Mama. - Oh, my clear children. Welcome home! Elizabeth, how are you feeling? - Never better, Mama. - Hmm. And you? - Well, thank you. - Victor, I have a surprise for you. Since you've been away, we've become acquainted with the most charming and cultured man, and he's a colleague of yours. Victor, you've grown a beard. I never noticed it. Don't you think it looks well on him, Elizabeth? Dr. Polidori, this is my daughter, Elizabeth. - I'm delighted to make your acquaintance at long last. - Bless my soul, you're here. I've just been showing Miss Prima the garden. - May I present my ward? Prima, Mrs. Frankenstein. - How do you do? - She's been longing to meet you. I've told her to make you her ideal, to copy everything you do. - That's a terrible responsibility. I hope I can live up to it. Qh, my earring! It must have come off in the carriage. - Uh. Miss Prima is a very observant young lady. - I needn't introduce you to Dr. Frankenstein. He knows you intimately. Well, he should. I've certainly talked enough about her, haven't I? Although I'm only her guardian, I'm worse than any proud parent. - Mama, how did you meet Dr. Polidori? - Oh, in the usual way. He came to call, explained that he was a friend of Victor's. You know, I had the most dreadful headache that day, and, you know, he made it go away. He just said, "You are feeling better," and then he looked at me. Have you noticed his eyes? - I mean, what do you actually know about him? - Well, after all, he is clear Victor's friend. Surely that's enough. - What's enough? - Mama has invited Prima to stay with us. - Well, you see, Dr. Polidori is giving a ball right here for Prima to introduce her to all the elite society. - But why is he leaving her here? - Dr. Polidori is traveling to London for a week of shopping and to issue personal invitations. - It was outrageous of him involving you in this! I, I mean, the responsibility, her health is so delicate. - All the more reason for her to be near a doctor. Dr. Polidori has such confidence in you, Victor. - Damn him! (people laughing) - Miss Prima's the only one who laughs at my stories. I've always thought youth and age have a lot in common. By the way, since we are family now, may I ask, exactly how old are you? - [Lady Fanschawe] Really, Richard. - Dr. Polidori says I look remarkably old for my age. - Well, if he weren't your guardian, I'd call him an ungallant brute. - If you will excuse me, I'm going to find Elizabeth. - [Prima] Oh. _ Qh! Are you all right, dear? - [Prima] I feel a little faint. - [Lady Fanschawe] Maybe you should take her to her room. - Oh. I'm terribly sorry, I... - Let us know if we can be of any help. - Yes, of course. (dramatic music) You saw that lady faint at the concert last night. An excellent imitation. (Prima laughs) Why did you do it? (dramatic music) (knocking on door) Come in. - How is she? - She's fine, fine. - Isn't she an angel? Why, the poor darling's so cold. (gentle piano music) - You startled me. - May I? - Yes, yes. Please do. (gentle piano music) (Prima laughs) (Prima gasps) (Prima laughs) I The church's one Foundation J" I Is Jesus Christ her Lord J' I She is His new creation J' I By water and the Word J' J' From heaven He came and sought her I I To be His holy bride J' J' With His own blood He bought her J' J' And for her life He died J' J' Elect from every nation J' I Yet one over all the earth I J' Her charter of salvation J' J' One Lord, one faith, one birth J' I One holy name she blesses J" J' Partakes one holy food J' I And to one hope she presses I I With every grace endued J' J' I love little kitty J' I His coat is so warm J' J' And if I don't hurt him J' J' He'll do me no harm J' Oh, you beautiful cat. (cat meows) - What are you doing? - Just playing a little game. - Constantine. (cat meows) - [Prima] Beautiful. - It's my gown for the ball. Yours is ready, too. Mama wants you to come and try it on. (dramatic music) - That petticoat is going to be too long for the gown. And where's that little jeweled neckband? - [Maid] Here, milady. - Thank you. Take that ribbon off, first. - Excuse me, Miss. ' No! - Oh, my dear child, how thoughtless I am. It must be something she treasures. Dr. Polidori gave it to her, no doubt. That hemline should be raised in the front, half an inch, perhaps. - [Maid] Milady is quite right. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Victor shushes) (dramatic music) - Please. Please. Please, make her go away! - Elizabeth, be quiet, you'll wake everybody. - I don't care who she is or what she is. Please, make her leave this house. - [Victor] Elizabeth, listen! - Get her out of this house! (she cries) - [Victor] Polidori! Now, you listen to me, Polidori. - [Henri] This place has served its purpose. What's the matter, dear colleague? You seem upset. - [Victor] You think you've got us all in your power. You have incriminated us. But I warn you, Polidori, I no longer care what happens to me, I am going to stop you! - What a ridiculous misunderstanding this is. Why, my clear fellow, after the ball tomorrow, you and your family need never set eyes on me again. Thanks to all of you, Prima is now a respectable member of society. And I shall be taking her to London at once. You don't believe me? Very well, if you demand proof of my good faith... (dramatic music) You are in my power, as you call it, only so long as I have him. You've kept your part of the bargain admirably. Now I'm ready to keep mine. (dramatic music) Doesn't it look harmless? (John speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) (liquid sizzling) (servants chuckle) (dramatic music) My dear colleague, you do want to be rid of him, don't you? He'd hardly fit in with your future plans, would he? (John speaks in foreign language) He's been rather temperamental ever since Prima left. (dramatic music) Wake up. (dramatic music) - Victor. - Yes, Victor's here. So all your troubles are over. Take Victor's arm. (dramatic music) Now you're going to take a beauty bath. (dramatic music) Prima bathed in one like that, and you remember how beautiful she was when she came out? (dramatic music) One never knows how much he understands. You neglected his speech, I'm disappointed in you. (snapping) You're tired. You want to rest. Lie down. There. Your presence creates a conflict. You must tell him. - He wants you to rest. - No. It must be your order. - Rest. Lie down. (dramatic music) - Tell him to go into a deep sleep. Tell him not to wake. - You are to go into a deep sleep. You are not to wake. (creature sighs) (dramatic music) - Bravo. Perfect. - You're sure he won't feel anything? - Perhaps, just at the last, an instant of surprise. Uh-huh. (dramatic music) _ wake LIP! ' [John] Fool! (dramatic music) (liquid gurgling) (John speaks in foreign language) (creature bangs on door) - What are you doing? - We're gonna burn the misshapen creature. Burn, traitor! Burn, Henri Clerval! (explosive explodes) HEY- You want to get rid of him just as much as I do, you hypocrite. Out of here. (fire crackling) (creature bangs on door) What a model parent you've been. You loved your creature so long as it was pretty, but when it lost its looks, ha, it was another matter. So much for your dainty conscience. (building explodes) (fire crackling) (cheerful orchestral music) (people murmuring) (cheerful orchestral music) Now that the past has gone up in flames, let's drink a toast to the future. (cheerful orchestral music) And what different futures, yours and mine, yet each will have what he desires. Only fools like Henri Clerval want vulgar fame. I shall have the power that works unseen and moves the world. You, alone, Frankenstein, when you read in your newspaper that a monarch has been deposed, or that two nations are at war with each other, will say to yourself, "That's the hand of Polidori. "That's the man who once called me colleague." - Long live Polidori The Invisible. May his plots thicken. (cheerful orchestral music) (people murmuring) You look pale, my girl. All's well, I tell you, our troubles are over. Give me a smile. Give me a smile. - My invitation for tonight never did arrive. It must have been lost by the courier service. I feel so embarrassed. I naturally assumed it was a costume ball. I hope I do not look too out of place. Everyone seems to be staring at me. (chuckles) - You look lovely. - Merci, monsieur. You do not think then that this is too old for me? - No, no, no, not at all. (cheerful orchestral music) (people murmuring) - Look, Prima, your master. Polidori, the puppet master. Shall I take off your collar and show them all that you're his puppet, hmm? - Dr. Frankenstein, you are forgetting yourself. (cheerful orchestral music) - Excuse me, may I have this dance? (cheerful orchestral music) - His father's a baronet and the richest man in the neighborhood. But we shall do better in London. I'm hoping for an aging earl. Our dear girl must get married as soon as is decently possible. An unmarried woman has no freedom of action. (cheerful orchestral music) - How cool your hands are. I love your cool hands. (cheerful orchestral music) - Once she has entered society with a husband, I shall have to find her the right lover. That will be far harder. She must become the mistress of a member of the ruling caste, a great banker, a cabinet minister, maybe even a royal prince. - And then you'll begin pulling the strings. - Then, I shall proceed to make her the most famous woman in Europe, the instrument of my power. (cheerful orchestral music) (people murmuring) - I see you've been taking her to the ballet. (cheerful orchestral music) (guests applauding) (people screaming) (glass crashes) - Agatha. (people murmuring) (Prima hisses) (people murmuring) (Prima screams) (people murmuring) (people screaming) (people murmuring) (women screaming) (people murmuring) (gun fires) (people murmuring) (PEOple gasp) _ Qh! (people murmuring) (people screaming) (John sobs) (dramatic music) - Why? - Beautiful, Victor. Beautiful. (dramatic music) - As a result of last night, sir, three people are dead and 10 more seriously injured. We are still searching for the maniac who was responsible. We've not found him yet, but believe me, wherever he may be hiding, we shall find him. - Dr. Polidori is responsible for the horrors of last night. He, and he alone is to blame. - We have Dr. Polidori in custody, ma'am. He behaves like a madman. Keeps ranting on about the girl who was murdered, mumbling something about having created her out of a corpse. He will probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane. - That man belongs in an institution. Does he not? - Chief Constable, I am responsible for last night, no one else. Dr. Polidori is a pathetic lunatic. As for the creature, whom you call a maniac, he cannot be held accountable for his actions. The fault is mine. I brought him to life from pieces of dead bodies. - This is remarkable. First, Dr. Polidori says that he made the murdered girl out of a corpse, and now you, Dr. Frankenstein, are trying to say that you created the maniac out of pieces of dead bodies? - Can I leave now? - Mr. Turner, may I speak to you privately? - Certainly, Mrs. Frankenstein. - My husband is not well. He suffers from delusions. On the very day of our wedding he had to leave me to consult with his physician. Well, if you do not believe me, my parents will verify it. - You mean, he was away from you on your wedding night? - Yes, and for several clays beyond. All this nonsense about making human beings from corpses and dead bodies. Surely a man of your high intelligence must realize that only someone who is deeply disturbed, like my poor husband, could say such ridiculous things. - But, my dear lady, Dr. Polidori is saying practically the same thing as your own husband. - Ah, but Mr. Turner, there is one great difference. - And what is that? - My father found out only this morning, unfortunately too late to help the poor victims of last night, that Dr. Polidori has a criminal record on the continent. - Indeed? - Oh, yes. In fact, my father now knows that Dr. Polidori has served several prison sentences in the past. Once in Spain, once in France, and twice in Germany. - I should like to speak to your father, if you please. - My father has only now gone to sleep, he's been up all night. Surely you don't want to wake him. - Well, I... - After all, Mr. Turner, I think you should show some consideration for my father. He was responsible for your appointment as Chief Constable of the county. - Oh, of course I would not dream of disturbing Lord Fanshawe's rest. Naturally, I believe everything that you have told me, Mrs. Frankenstein. The sooner you and your husband get away from this nightmare, the better for you both. Or should I say, for all three of you. - Thank you, Mr. Turner, my father will appreciate your help to us. - Goodbye, Mrs. Frankenstein. (birds chirping) And good luck to you, too, Dr. Frankenstein, and your charming wife. (birds chirping) - Victor. Victor, please. I can't have the baby here after all this. Please pull yourself together. The ship leaves in a few hours. - The Ship? What ship? - [Elizabeth] The ship my father's hired to take us to America. I won't have our baby here. (waves lapping) (sailor whistles) - [Sailor] Hold it tall! - You were right, Elizabeth, we must start a new life elsewhere. Forget about the past. - It's forgotten, I shall never speak of it again. - I love you very much. - And I love you. (sailor whistles) - [Sailor] Hoist away! (waves lapping) - Good evening, my children. - What are you doing on this ship? - Along sea voyage will do us all good. America, land of opportunity. You and I have both made mistakes in the past, Victor, but with our creative talent, think of the opportunities we shall have. - You should be in an institution for life. - Mrs. Frankenstein, if you, a mere woman, could make a fool of that Chief Constable, how much the more easily could a man of my experience and powers of persuasion. - How did you get here? This ship was personally engaged for us by Elizabeth's father. - I told the Captain the simple truth, that I am a close friend of the family. I happen to be in a position to know more about our stalwart captain than your father, Mrs. Frankenstein. I know, for example, that he's served several prison sentences. Once in Spain, once in France, and twice in Germany. Poor man, I think we can rely on him. - I was right! I knew it! - [Victor] Right about what? - I've had a feeling someone's been following us ever since we left home. - So, Polidori is onboard. We'll just have to make the best of it. - [Elizabeth] How can you be so calm about it? - Well, what do you want me to do about it?! - It's the worst thing that could have happened. (suspenseful instrumental music) (knocking on door) - Come in. - What do you want? - I have a lot to discuss with Victor. You've made it very cozy in here. You shouldn't drink too much of that. Victor, the Captain has some superb brandy, I'll get him to send you some down. - Polidori, your presence here disturbs my wife and me. We shall expect to see as little of you as possible during this entire voyage. Now, goodnight, sir. - I was only going to say that we shouldn't waste too much time in New York. When we arrive we should proceed directly to Philadelphia, where they've been doing some interesting chemical experimentation which we might be able to use. Bishop. Bishop. (water purling) That's checkmate. - Get out, get out, damn you! - Try to get some rest. Both of you. (dramatic music) - You're drunk, Victor. Perhaps you should go to bed. - I'm not drunk, and I don't want to go to bed. - Victor, I know Polidori's presence on the ship has disturbed you, but we mustn't let him come between us. - Can't you stop talking about him?! (thunder rumbling) - What are you doing with my key? - Your, your door was open, I locked it. - That was unnecessary. My few valuables are in the Captain's safe. - My husband and I have just had an unpleasant scene. It was because of you. - Your husband has been drinking too much. - Dr. Polidori, when we leave this ship, will we be free of you? - You're very unkind. - Will you make any more claims on us? - How could I make claims on you? I, poor, feeble, old man? It's my genius that claims Victor. It claims his mind, it claims his life. Your husband is a totally dedicated man. - He worked for you against his will. He did it only to protect me. - Is that what he tells you? You should have seen the passion in his eyes when my Prima was created. And he'd do the same thing again if I said the word. That passion of his is stronger, far stronger, than his love for you. - Only as long as you are here to corrupt him. - I wasn't the first. Have you forgotten Henri Clerval? (thunder rumbles) Mrs. Frankenstein, please open the door. I want to climb under the covers and avoid the storm which is rapidly becoming worse, and tell my Chinese boy to come down, I shall need him. - Have you nothing else to say to me? - What else could I say? This situation is not nearly so tragic as you make out. Besides, you have no other choice. - Are you sure? - My servant is up on deck. Tell him to hurry. Can you hear me, Mrs. Frankenstein? (thunder rumbles) (thunder rumbles) (thunder rumbles) - Pollydolly. PoHydoHy. - You decided to join us. You're looking for Victor, no doubt. Victor's your friend, you want to see him, huh? I'll take you. Victor! Victor, quick! - What was that? - Your creature's in here with me. He's come onboard with us. - Uh? - No. - [John] Victor. - This is our chance. It's in there. With him. - What?! - No, wait! (creature laughs) - Polidori, Polidori! - [John] Open that door as quickly as you can. Someone's locked it from the outside. - Give me the key. (creature laughs) - [Creature] Victor. (J0hn groans) - Get your friend to come up on deck with us, it's too confining in here. You will come up with Victor, won't you? Once we're up on deck, the sailors will help us to subdue him. (waves rumbling) (thunder rumbles) - Look out! - No, no, no, no, no. Back, back. Come on, go on. Come on out, tell him. - Come on! Qut! (thunder rumbles) - [John] Oh, no, no, lightning, I hate that. - He must have been hiding in the hold! - [John] Victor, lightning, I'm afraid. - Victor! - Help me! I'm afraid. Help me, the lightning, the lightning's coming. (waves rumbling) (creature grunts) - oh! no! no, I10, I10! (John mumbles) (creature laughs) Help, help! Someone! Help! Oh, please, help me, someone. ' No! (creature grunts) Help, help. Help, I'm afraid! Help me, help me! (creature grunts) I'm afraid, help, help! (waves rumbling) Help! Help me! Help! (waves rumbling) (creature laughs) (waves rumbling) - [Captain] Atkins! Williams! (waves rumbling) - If your men go up there, he'll kill them all, one by one, and Dr. Polidori as well. - [John] For God's sake, Victor, help me! - Victor, that man is your worst enemy. Leave him to his fate. (waves rumbling) (wind howling) (thunder rumbles) (creature laughs) - Help me, help me! Help! (thunder rumbles) (creature laughs) (John screams) (thunder rumbles) (creature laughs) - Why, if it isn't the Devil himself! (thunder rumbles) (creature laughs) Old Nick in person! He's in command of this ship now. - Poor Pollydolly! (creature laughs) (waves rumbling) (Elizabeth screams) - Victor. (Elizabeth screams) ' [Victor] Ah! (waves rumbling) - Leave him! (waves rumbling) (wind howling) (dramatic music) My husband's in there. I wanna go to him. - If we all rush in together, how can he possibly stand up to us? - Mm-hmm. - Who'll go in with me? You make me sick! The lot of you. (cocks guns) (gun fires) - [All] Ah! (waves rumbling) - Man the lifeboats! All hands to the boats! (waves rumbling) (creature screams) - Come on, this is your only chance. - I'm not going with you, just leave me! (creature grunts) - [Sailor] Lower the boat! - What the hell! We'll make it back to England. Bligh did it, and so can I. (creature laughs) (man screams) (waves rumbling) (wind howling) - [Elizabeth] What more do you want of him? - Victor made me. - God has forgiven him for that sin. He has a child now. Our child. - Child? - What have you to do with life? You thing of death. - Do you still assume the authority of the Almighty, Miss Fanshawe? (Elizabeth groans) Poor Brassolis astyra. (Elizabeth groans) (waves lapping) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (dramatic music) (waves lapping) (dramatic music) - Elizabeth? (dramatic music) Elizabeth, where are you? (dramatic music) Elizabeth? (dramatic music) Elizabeth? (dramatic music) Elizabeth? (dramatic music) Oh, my God. (wind howling) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (dramatic music) (Victor groans) (dramatic music) Are you satisfied now? Have you punished me enough for giving you life?! (echoing) (ice cracking) I've wronged you, I know. I disowned you, I wanted to destroy you. How can I blame you for anything that you've done? Poor creature, are you as weary of life as I am? If only I could rid mankind of us both. I'm a weak human, I can't stay long in this terrible place, but your iron body will keep you alive against your will. You'll be all alone here. That would be too cruel. (wind howling) Forgive me. Please, forgive me. (wind howling) Forgive me! (echoing) (ice cracking) - Beautiful. Victor. (ice rumbling) (Victor laughs) Victor. Bravo. (Victor laughs) Bravo, Victor. Rest. (ice rumbling) (dramatic orchestral music) (intense orchestral music)
