[music playing] Hello, Mark. Hello. Oh, Mark, you must be tired. Wouldn't you like me to get something for you? We don't have enough time. You're so mean with your time. I'm stuck with the only bits you got left. You ought to be content, Conchita. Why can't you stay just once in awhile when I need you? Why don't you relax? You know I can't when there's a lot of big money at stake. I got responsibilities. They must certainly trust you. God willing. Still have an appetite, huh? Sure, I'm famished-- if you mean what I think you mean. Good. Join me, won't you, Conchita? Come on, come soak my back. Please? You know how I love it. [gunshots] That's it. If you'd just sign? If by chance you remain abroad for any particular reason, don't forget to send us your remittance, and-- and we'll renew your safe deposit for another year. Thank you. Keep this key safely. Thank you so much. You're very kind. Goodbye. The pleasure is ours. [whinnying] It'll be very easy. Right now business is really booming. The main advantage is, of course, the land it's on. You know what you have to do. Sure. And I'm to avoid unnecessary risks. There shouldn't be any this time. Sounds good. Oh, Mr. Casey? You're wanted on the telephone. OK. I'll take it. Yes? VINCE: Any news? No, not yet. Do you want me to take care of it? No, it's something I can handle. But you keep alert. I don't intend to lose my shirt again. Yes, I get you, Vince. I've got identical interests. So don't worry, I'll be careful. Remember one thing, Shawn. It's no easy task to ignore a pot of gold as large as the one in question. SHAWN: I won't forget. That's it. Passport and $100,000. There were 500,000. Well, baubles like these have to go into cover for quite a while, you know? OK, so what else? I'll go to 150. You're not the only one in this place. I want 250 plus passport. You're tough to bargain with. Here. 220. Take it or leave it. Be ready. She's on her way down now. [gunshot] Stop where you are! Police! I want to know what you want from me. I just want to know where you stand. What your intentions are. What side you're on. Can't you see that you make life here worse than it is? This is one of the most revolting prisons in the world, without law and order. That's why you have to decide who you're with, Sandra. It's important. You better ask Terry, then. Does she own you? Does she? Can't you make up your own mind? Terry's the one who makes the rules. I can't say yes or no without her consent. If you'd like, I'll have you transferred to my cell. You'll be safer with me. No. I can't. What is it, Sandra? Anything wrong? Oh, nothing really, Terry. Nothing important. Why don't you tell her? Not afraid, are you? What's she supposed to tell me, huh? That she's sick of you. Like the rest of us are. If you don't shut that filthy trap of yours, I'm gonna knock your teeth in. Just try it! You're finished here! She's taking a beating. She got her good. I wish I played [inaudible]. -Break it up! -That's enough! Out of my way! Stop it! Stop it! That filthy slut started it! Circulate, the rest of you. There's nothing to look at. Come on, get up. Come on, girls. Keep moving. Get your exercise. Come on. Move. Wakey, wakey! Time to get up. 5:30! Come on! Wake up, girls. Shake a leg. You'll get a couple of days' isolation if you don't move. Shit. God, how I'd love to lie in bed all day. You belong in bed, Sandra. Wake up! Come on, move it. Get on your feet. Up, up. Wake up! I would show you what's what if I could. Get out of there. Good morning, madame. How's the weather out there? It's very cold today. You're better off inside. All depends what you mean by inside. Come on, line up for the showers. Go ahead, honey. Go on, get moving. I'll be along in a minute. Hurry up! Get in line. Move it. What's the matter with you? Oh, I forgot my toothpaste. --Where's the other girls? Who knows? Come on. Step on it! Get going. Don't dawdle. Wash. At least I'm corner. WOMAN: Quit playing around. The water's hot today. What are we waiting for this morning? I expect we're waiting for nothing, as usual. Up you get. Begin searching. Nothing there. We'll see about that. Where have you hidden it? Come on. I've hidden nothing. How long am I expected to wait for an answer? I know you've hidden them someplace or other. You might as well talk. You can't beat me. It's silly. You-- you don't mean nothin'. That so? Oh! Oh! Untie her. I bet you'd give your soul to change places with me. I wouldn't be surprised if you'd dream up a few things to do to me. But whatever you thought of could never match what I'm going to do to you now, lady. You're the toughest cookie in here. Even the guards are scared of you. But I'll break you. Bend her over! No! No! And now let's have a peek into your safe, and see what you're hiding in there. [groaning] [screaming] [screaming continues] No, don't! Let her be. You. Come on. But I-- Poor thing. There, there. It's all over now. We'll look after you. But I did put them in there! So they found them? I don't need to bother. You pals will knock you off for this. Oh please, don't! I only did what you asked me to. Don't leave me to their mercy. There's nothing I can do. Leave us. Oh, dear. What a terrible thing. I never expected to see the day when they'd reduce you to this state, dear. Pity's not what I need. Nothing will bring me down. I can stand a little torture. I don't crack easy. Let me tell you, Mr. Casey, that filly of yours gives you the certainty that you'll win at least two or three important races this season. Yes, I'm sure you're right. Excuse me a second. Sure. You know what a bargain you got when you bought that lovely horse? Go call Shawn. Here he comes now. Vince! This is kind of sudden. I thought you were gonna call me. I could have come to you. I just wanted to see how you were doing with your horses. Pretty good, huh? That all you want? I'm sure it upset you to lose all this. You're not kidding. It's been quite a fight. Why not come inside and have a drink? Another time, thanks. You're a good boy, Shawn. Most respectful and obedient. I'm fond of you. I trust you, but not everyone does. There are those who believe you acted a bit carelessly in this last deal. Your behavior was thoughtless. And I lost a lot of face over it. It's pleasant out here. But don't forget, life is worth everything else. More than money, more than power. But I don't have to tell you that. Though a reminder doesn't harm anyone. No need to worry. I'll have you know I never worry. So long, kid. [knocking] Come in. You sent for me, madame? I thought you looked lonely up on the roof on guard, Robert. Well, I-- Pity to waste such good looks. Aren't you engaged or married? No. Not yet. Don't you like the gentle sex? Well, I'm not a-- I don't know what to say. In a prison as depressing as this one, the only thing there is is sex, so. [moaning] Same as usual? What time do you get off? Smart ass. Trevor. Report sick tomorrow. Oh? And who do you think you are? The boss? You better do like I say, and don't fool around-- or you might find you have to stay in the infirmary. I was asking about you. They said you were on kitchen duty. I volunteered. The food's better, and I can avoid that dining room for three or four days. You're not losing weight. God awful place. I hate it. Why were you looking for me? If you have something to say, go ahead and say it while no one's around. Well, it's kind of complicated. Except for her, she's only got two years. The rest of us can only hope to leave this place feet first. Look, I've studied the plan, and let me tell you-- there's no way it can work. The trouble is we're cut off from the world. And the miserable wretches who live around here wouldn't hesitate to shoot us on sight for the pathetic reward they'd get. And if by chance we're taken alive-- If there's only a few of us, we're far more likely to get caught. It's worse than the UN. We'd never agree. Everyone one of us would follow you, Terry, if you'd lead us. You're the only one with balls to do it. We'll need weapons, ammunition, and supplies, and food, and money-- all of which could be ours if we occupy the administration building, don't you think? Who else knows about this? Only our poor cellmate over there, leaning against the wall. No. I wouldn't trust her more than a flea. Think about it. And try to work something out. I don't have much appetite today. It's so hot. I can't wait to take a nap. Do you feel drowsy? No. So I see. You eating anymore? No. You can take it away. -But I haven't finished yet. -Hurry up and eat. All right. Hey, thanks for the horse you gave me. He won, and paid quite handsomely. You've got any news for me, Pete? Well, I investigated quite a lot, but the results are-- You came up with something? That she's now called Laura Trevor, and is serving two years in jail. You've got your facts straight? Yes. It's her, no doubt at well. I've got a picture. You've done well. Thanks. Right, I'll be seeing you. That's real good news. [laughter] How about if the guards wake up? I'll take them something to keep them happy. Good. Now pin your ears back up. You all know that every two weeks, the new supplies come in. And we have to make our move on one of those delivery days. I've been thinking-- there'll be a lot of distractions-- unloading, and so on. We must take advantage of it. You're right. But watch out, because we must grab control of three places-- the warden's office, administration, and the armory. Let me welcome you new girls to our penitentiary, where, I must remind you, you leave the outside world behind, and where the laws of that world no longer exist. And here I am the law. Never forget that you were sent here for punishment, and not to amuse yourselves. So my job is evident. I want to make sure you remember the reason that you were sent here. I don't tolerate mischief of any kind, insolence, or disobedience. So get your ideas straight. There's no fooling in here. Do you know what will happen if ever I catch you cheating, and what I'll do to you? Well, don't try it! What is all this bullshit she's giving us? That's what I want to know-- Ah! No! Give her to me! Ow! No! [beating continues] Everybody understand? That was for insolence. I'm done with them for today. They can go to their cells. Get up, you. Give me your personal effects. That's all I've got. Here you are. I see you graduated from a business school. Yes, that's right. You can send this one up to my room. As you wish. Go on, get in line, you. You'll be assigned to your cells. Move! We're nearly there. Stop where you are. My name's Rose. My name's Conchita. You sleep up there. Not bad. Not bad at all. You can sleep down here, too. Any time you're in the mood. What's the matter? Don't you like it? No, I-- Afraid? Yeah-- no! You'll do what I want you to. At least give her a chance to choose beds. You like the look of her, too? Does it make any difference? Sure. I want her. Is that so? [grunting] I was told to give you this, and to do whatever you order me to do. What do you want? Go outside, and don't let anyone in. All right. Call me when you're finished. I will. Got much pain? No. That'll be fine now. Have we many this morning? Yes, but no special cases. Will you help me not to waste time? There are only two which might hold you up a bit. The others are simple to deal with. Quite routine. -Good. I'll leave them to you. Fine. Well, uh-- you and Wilson go see the doctor. And you come with me. Let's go. No one will disturb you in here, Trevor. You see, we keep this for critical or contagious cases. Which category am I? If you don't know, I don't. Food poisoning is what's written down here. Oh, yeah? Ciao. Hi, there. You infectious? What do you want to catch? Don't get offended. I get out of here in a couple of days, and I don't want to get sick at this point. Oh, sure. You finish your sentence? No. They're letting me out for good conduct. Anything you need outside? What I need is freedom, and you can't give me that. No, I'm afraid not. I finished in the kitchen. Mm. You better change your uniform. I'd return to your cell. Eyes and ears open. I tell you everything, Warden. My plans for the prisoners would bore you. Well, it's a dangerous subject. I only have a few intimate friends, and they don't cheat me, if they know what's good for them. This time I'm going to eliminate all the troublemakers for good, and I'm not kidding you. Where are you going? My turn on duty. But I had your shift changed. I know, and thank you. But it's impossible. I don't want my companions laughing behind my back. You tell me if anyone does that to you, and they'll regret it. I'd prefer to look after myself, if you don't mind. I understand. You're proud, naturally. So I'll see you tonight, instead. The minute I finish my turn on guard, I'll join you. I want that bed nice and hot. You filthy girls! Why don't you crap in your own beds, instead of on the floor? What's biting you, all of a sudden? You clean what we dirty. I'm in no state of health to clean up the latrines for you sluts who were born in jail! Born in jail? Well, you'll die there! How dare you? I dare, I dare! You old cow! Get about your business! -I'll report you for this! -Oh, yeah? Who to, eh? That'd laugh at you, you poor old cow! Hey! What's going on down there? You old bag! Ha! You count yourself lucky you didn't meet me 20 years ago! Oh, yeah? And what would you have done to me, eh? Kiss me to death or nibble my ears off? Don't you talk to me like that! Lay off! That'll do! Pull yourself together! Shut up, the rest of you! Dirty sluts, the lot of 'em! Oh, she's great. She got what we need for the key. I keep you waiting? I don't mind, if it's worth it. That nurse is my buddy. I hear you're pretty close to the warden, too. Don't tell me she scares you? Let's say I'd rather not risk her wrath. Well, some of the other girls would pay for what I'm about to give you. I'll give you a fair exchange. You don't know how fortunate you are. But I'm going to tell you, you'd do well to stick with me and stay away from the others. And why should I stick with you? Well, when they come to take away your companions for plotting to get out of here, I'll see they leave you alone. Is this a trick or something to get what you want? I don't need any tricks to get what I want, so you just watch which sides you pick. I'm not on anybody's side. Who should I be afraid of? Huh? Someone in your cell is organizing a jailbreak. You're joking. No joke. It's serious. So stay away from it. How do you know? I know. [moaning] Out of the way. Go on. Inside. And hurry. -Oh. I thought you were in the infirmary. I want to talk to you. Alone. OK, Margaret. Close your ears, will you? Well? Go on. They found out that you're organizing a break. They did? You sent for me, warden? Yes, one moment. All right, Bertha, I'm counting on you. So see to it. I'll do the best I can. I want to know the results very soon. All right. Anything else? No. You could go, Bertha. Mm. Did I disturb you? No. I'm off duty now. Before I go back on guard. I missed you today. It seems like a century since we were together. But we ate lunch together, didn't we? In a manner of speaking. Why don't you sit down? There's nobody here. Don't you have work to do? Nothing that can't way til later. Wouldn't you like to spend a little time with me? I thought we agreed that I should come tonight after guard duty? But I'm feeling so awfully lonely. Kiss me, Robert. Now you can go. We'll see each other tonight. Go. -Sure thing. Be with you later. The warden in that jail is an old friend of mine, and I trust her. She'll help us in our plan. I'm quite sure of that. That's important. You see, Shawn, it pays to always keep on the alert. The reason I don't make mistakes is that I'm well organized. It should all go as smooth as clockwork. It's up to you now. I realize that. Count on me. I know I can. You must do it. Whatever the reason, I'll come through. That's good to hear. Loyalty-- that's what I like. But I hope you're sincere, my boy. Oh, I'm sincere. Whatever happens, you want to continue to race horses, I imagine. Be a real shame if you were to lose what's taken you so long to build up here. Yes, indeed. Hey Robbie, go get some shut eye. I'll take over. Yeah, I'm falling asleep at the wheel. At least your bed's warm. Make room for me. Be glad to. I got a little cold out there. Don't worry. I'll soon warm you up. Inside. Quick. Wake up, Rebecca. Come on. I found the passage to the offices. And I know there are arms and ammunition in the cupboard. Only I must have your help. I want you to quietly follow me. Understood? Let's go. Come on. Careful you don't fall. These steps are long and steep. Is it much further? No. Not much. Come on! What's the matter with you? I'm scared. We're almost there. Don't give up now. This is it. We're here. But where's the passage? There. We're supposed to go through that opening? Let go! I haven't-- Do it! No! No! I won't! Are you trying to give us away, Rebecca? You're a spy! No! I'm not a spy! I swear! I'm not a spy! Try begging your friend the warden to help you. This is what you get for trying to give us away! Learn your lesson! That's what you get for spying! Come on! No! Down you go! Help! I'm drowning! Drown, damn you! No! I'm not a spy! Come on! She's still alive. No! No! Come on. Let's go. Who's in here? Oh, it's you. Shut the door. She's not here. Rebecca's not here. This is her cell. Ah. Where have you hidden your cellmate? You mean Rebecca Cornwall? Yes, Cornwell. Where is she? Why ask us? How do we know? She said she was on her way to the bathroom, but she could have gone to your office. Why don't you look? No. She's not there. She just isn't any place. I don't think anybody disappears completely. She must turn up in the end. WOMAN: Where's the warden? WOMAN: Call the warden! WOMAN: Find her at once! Drowned in a sewer. Poor bitch. What an awful way to die. No point looking at her. Cover her. Dirty killers. I have to inform you that a very serious incident has occurred here in this prison, which I intend to discuss openly with you. So listen carefully. One of your companions has died, and was discovered today. Rebecca Cornwall was murdered by one or more of you, drowned in excrement. And I intend to catch the culprits. I shall consider you all guilty until I'm satisfied I've caught the killers of this girl. You won't be able to plot because you won't meet in private, not even in the toilets. All privileges are now abolished. Parents, husbands, lovers, children-- nobody can visit you, so you will have no contact with the outside world. No communication at all. You will rot here without hope. Not only will you not be able to receive visitors and letters, but until I decide, forget the luxury of speaking. Unless I get the killers. Put the girls in their cells. Shoot. We'd better be getting a move on, before she separates us. I'll give you the signal. All right. Get back to your cells now. Cut the chatter. Get in line. Hurry up! Sort yourselves out. Move. Come on. Let's go! No bunching up, there. Who does this belong to? Come on, now. Own up. Whose is it? It belongs to me. Take her name. Name? Rose Middleton. Don't let it happen again. Incredible. That was mine. Why'd you claim the money? I owe you so much. It was the least I could do. Hey, you. Trevor. You gotta return to the infirmary. I'm not the least bit tired. Neither am I. I don't know what I'll do when you get out of here. Well, I should be here for more than a year if all goes well. Why do you say that? The warden could find us out. What if she does? Do you think it matters? Oh, no. She'd be real kind. Did you kill that little bitch who did the spying? Oh, Robert, Rebecca and me been together. Well, it's curtains if she gave your name to the warden. Don't worry. Hey, where you going? Got a turn of duty. Pity. Don't get cold again. Hm? This shot's for you. And it's not vitamins. It's the latest discovery-- guaranteed to make you talk. And once it's in your bloodstream, you've had it for good. Murderess. You're a dirty traitor. Just tell me where you've hidden the merchandise. I didn't get orders to kill you. Tell me all you know, then you can go, Conchita. And if I told you a lie? No chance. It would be detected real soon. No point having ideas of seeing me dead. There's always someone else to replace me. We are many-- you were alone. Go to hell! This'll make you talk. It would even work on a deaf mute. I'm not going to talk. Yes you will. You'll do plenty of talking. Lies. The supplies come in tomorrow. We must have everything done before they arrive. We're ready. Where'd you put the diamonds? Tell me. Go on. No. As you wish. Cover for me, will ya? I gotta go take a leak. Yeah, sure I will. But hurry back. Don't worry, I'll just be a minute. Come on, Dora. Hurry! Come on! Here's the key to the armory. I think-- What do you think? I think we should include Conchita. Go on, then. Get her. -OK. Careful. Don't be seen! You'd better talk. You have no choice. You're trapped. Tell me where you hid the diamonds, then you can sleep as long as you like. I-- I-- Go on. You'll be sorry! Hey, what's going on? [gunshot] No! You are about to talk. I'll make you talk. You got here just in time. Now I'm the one who's in debt to you. Come on. Hurry. Now we can see how this affects you. Take the gun. What have you done with the others? They've gone to the armory. Then let's go. Let me just get into some clothes. Go ahead. Hello? Yes, it's me, Conchita. Yes. Tomorrow. Fine. Be OK. All right. -Conchita, is it working? -Not yet. Go on. Well-- are you completely crazy? You realize you'll be severely punished for this? Where'd you get those weapons? Never you mind! For this dirty trick, you're all going to pay with your lives! Listen, stop intimidating us with your threats! I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you're powerless to stop us. Now I'm going to flush you down the toilet. On your feet! No! Not that! Stabbing's a bit too easy. I prefer her to die slowly. She deserves a repellent death to match her life. Get her out of here! You swine! You'll never get away with this! Where's Conchita? I don't know. Come on! [alarm] OK, hold it. The authorities know all about this. If I'm spared, perhaps they'll be lenient with you. Be still, do you hear? And stop your foolishness. Please don't do anything drastic. I promise to forget your names, if you'll give up now. It's not too late, but it will be soon. I'm surprised you think we're naive enough to believe it. Come on, let's go. Guards! Help! [gunshot] [gunshot] [alarm] Let's go. We know for certain that some of you sneaked out of your cells and murdered the warden. Inform me if you know their names. I have to warn you, if you don't tell us, your silence counts as an act of complicity. For this, as well as other acts committed by you in the past few hours, you can be sentenced to a further 10, or even 20 years in this penitentiary. Go on then, Margot. No, I don't want to get into it. Oh, really, stop it. Oh, leave her alone, can't you? If she doesn't feel like taking part, then leave it to Rosie. We know we can trust her. No, I know that. But can she manage it? Why don't you ask her? Pretty sure, yes. Yes, I can. But can I be sure you won't forget me? I always pay my dues, and my debt to you is a pretty big one. Let's go. She's screwed. So's he. Poor bastard. Oh, she's been out of her mind for days. No, I don't know what's wrong. Did you interrogate her? Blood out of a stone. Well, I think I know what's going on. The other girl? All right, she's not moving from there. Don't worry. Everything's perfectly under control. She's got to tell you in the end. It's only a question of patience. Just patience. Yes, all right. Oh, and don't forget that the supply boat goes back early tomorrow morning, and it doesn't return for two weeks. Did you get that? Yes. Yes. Ciao. You mind if I take care of it? Be offended if you didn't. Help yourself. [beeping] I'm exhausted. Will somebody wake me? Don't worry. You sleep. I'll keep guard. Thanks, Conchita. You're a doll. Hey, Terry. Wake up now, will ya? Rosie, screw this up. Here. No, not that way. Look. Well, it works. Help me with this, will ya? Give me a hand here. Pull him out. He's heavy! You oughta know that already. You mean you didn't? Come on, take it easy. Keep thinking of all those big, fat dollars. -Keep pushing. -Over that way. Keep on working. OK. There. No one will ever look down there. I congratulate you. It was a magnificent idea. Running away, we'd never have gotten far. We'd be carried out in a couple of boxes. Come on, let's get the warden out of her coffin. Yeah, you're right. She's in her favorite position. How often I've dreamed of seeing her like this. You filthy, sadistic murderess. What you got there, Terry? Air freshener. That ought to stop them from stinking. Yeah. For a while, anyway. Help me put the wall back. Get the oxygen. Hurry up with it! Give it to me. Ow! [gasping] Let's get the lid on. I guess this is what you planned to do. Why's that? Terry would have been a threat to our safety. I knew you'd kill her. It was obvious. It was a question of when, not if you'd do it. So it was really so obvious? No. Otherwise she'd have realized it. I just felt it. I can't explain why. Two cylinders are safe in the one. They'll keep the coffin filled with oxygen for a couple of hours, then we'll need two more to carry me through. With care they'll last four hours each, so it should be OK. Right. At least, cuts down on the risk. We don't want any surprises, do we? Got to be ready for anything. What makes you so sure you can trust me? You have everything to gain by it. Never a truer word. Put the lid on, and wish me luck. All well? Yes, fine. The key. Samantha [inaudible]. There's something wrong. There's no oxygen. It's empty. Oh, no! There's no air! I'm suffocating! [gasping] [laughter] Open it. Make sure. -No. Yes. Do as I tell you. There's no key on her. Search her. Here? Go on! Where else? If you pay me what you owe me, I'll be going now. All right? -Yes. Of course. There's no key. Pay him. At once. Hey! Shawn! We made it! We made it! Oh, Shawn! Marvelous. It's better than marvelous! You played your part like a veteran performer. A real trooper. We're rich, Shawn! Rich! Come on, let's go spend some of this! [laughter] [music playing]
