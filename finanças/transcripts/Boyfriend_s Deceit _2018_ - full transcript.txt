[tense music] Last chance, Ms. Tatum. No, please. You know it's only a matter of time before ID John Doe. Wait, listen. Maybe that'll point to why you killed him. I didn't do it! There's too much evidence to take your word for it. Please, it, it wasn't me! Watch your head. [groans] It wasn't! Let's go. [engine revving] [eerie tones] What's wrong? I think you've got a tail. [radio beeps] Dispatch, this Transpo 42 requesting police escort on Route 33 heading northbound to county. [radio beeps] [music intensifies] [muffled speaking from radio] [exciting shouting] [music swells] Yeah! Woo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! [men laughing] [driver chuckles] [radio beeps] Dispatch, cancel that last request. You're a bit antsy tonight. Man, I just wanna get home. [tires screeching] Bruce! [glass crashing] [metal crunching] [unsettling music] [glass clinking] [inhaling sharply] [glass clinking] [groaning] [gasping] [pained shouting] [metal rattling] [groaning] [gasping] [frustrated growling] [music turns suspenseful] [keys jangling] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [pained groaning] Where does it hurt? [officer mumbles] Okay, here, just hang on. Hello? Is anyone... Hello? Okay, look, don't, don't move, all right. I'll get some help. [suspenseful music] [groaning] [glass clinking] [radio beeps] Hello? [static crackling] Hello? Hello? There's been an accident. We, we need an ambulance. An officer is hurt. Please. [screams] [tense music] Get up! Come on, get up. Consider this a favor. No, let me go! Let me go! [groaning] [thudding] Go! Run! [heart-pounding music] Annie. Oh, Annie. [Annie gasps] Come back here! [peaceful music] [music swells] Okay. Okay. Good morning. Hey. Did you sleep well? Mm-hmm, yep. I wondered where you went. Oh, I gotta get ready for work. What smells so good? [laughs softly] Breakfast. You're amazing. Well, I mean, it's just breakfast. [cellphone ringing] Oh, can you? It's your assistant. Oh, right. Hey Karen. Hi. Yeah, I know. I know, it's the second time that I have forgotten to meet you at the gym. Okay, how about this? I'll just, we'll do it tomorrow. No, I promise I will meet you tomorrow. Right. Okay, see you soon. Bye. You're horrible, I just made that. Hmm, you haven't kicked me out yet. Hey, aren't you gonna be late? Mm, No. I don't have to be there 'til nine. So there's really no rush today anyway. Okay, well, I made more bacon, and it's on the stove, all right. Mm, great. See you. Bye. [Annie sighs] Oliver, you boxed me in again. Hmm. I'm sorry, Annie, I'll get that. And you know that if you actually just unpack your things, you could park in the garage. Yeah, thank you, I'm workin' on it. Okay. [telephone ringing] Tell me the truth. Did you sleep in? No, I was awake. I've been workin' for a few hours. You should be cuddling up to the cute new boyfriend. I say cute, but who knows. Oh, he's cute. When do I get to meet him? Mornin', ladies. Oh, good morning, Jerry. Okay, the Bergettis their meeting up to tomorrow. Yeah, I'll be ready. Okay, and how are we on the engineering for the Strausberg project? Mr. Stein would like to know. I've been working with engineering, and I will get something soon. Okay. He only calls your dad Mr. Stein to you. Kinda weird. Yeah, well, I like to keep work as work. [gentle music] Oh. Mr. Stein. Would you like to have dinner? No. No, thank you. Have a good night. [cellphone ringing] Hey. Hey, where are you? Are you almost home? Yeah, I'm about 20 minutes away. Why? I'm planning dinner. Really? Yeah. Which restaurant sounds good? [laughs] Mm-hmm. [doorbell rings] Hey, who is that? Hang on. You didn't order takeout, did you? Uh, it's, uh, it's just a colleague. Um, looks like I need to run down to the office. And it can't wait 'til tomorrow? Um, it's urgent, so, I'll be back as quick as I can. Okay, all right. [gentle music] [groans] [uneasy music] [sighs] Hmm. [sighs] Mm, this is good. Yeah, that's close to there. [clunking] [footsteps thudding] [door rattling] Annie? Hey, are you up? [Annie vocalizes irritation] [sighs] Sorry that took so long. I'm in a lot of trouble, aren't I? I should have brought some flowers or... No, it's okay. I'll just heat it up. You know, don't bother. There's a crisis at the Atlanta office. I've gotta get on the next plane outta here. Oh, does that happen often? Thankfully, no. Okay, well, do you need my help with anything? No, really, I've just gotta grab a bag. Okay. [car horn honks] Is that my taxi? You're not gonna take your car? No, you know, I hit something on the way home. Some animal or something. You hit something? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just, I wanna do this to be safe. [groans] Sorry I've gotta leave so soon. You know, we'll have to plan a getaway sometime. Yeah. All right, I'll call you when I land. Okay. Bye. [gentle music] [groans] What? Oh crap. [music turns tense] [sighs] All right, okay. Good morning, Annie. [sighs] I'm so sorry. Were you working again? No, I overslept, seriously. But I was looking forward to it. Spin class? Liar. Okay, well, maybe not. But I was planning on it. Don't worry about it, I slept through my alarm, too. The Bergettis just sat down. Oh, okay, great. And where are we on the Strausberg project? Engineering has just signed off. Okay, good. Where's Jerry? I'm right here. Hey, look, I like to make a late entrance to these things. Yeah, I know, it reminds the clients that you're the big boss. You're throwin' a wrench into my plans and... Well, watch this. I'll make it up to you. I mean, look you. You knocked it outta the park. Thank you. So I hear the Bergettis liked your design. You know, they walked out on two other firms. It was on my mind. Just to think, I almost handed this over to O'Connell. [chuckles] There's a reason you hired me, Jerry. You're one of the best architects in the state. And I deliver results. That you do. It's in your blood. Cheers. Call Oliver. This is Oliver. You know what to do. [voicemail beeps] Hey babe, it's me. Just makin' sure that you got in safely. Haven't heard heard from you yet, so just thought I'd... [siren wails] [groans] Cops. [siren wails] [sighs] I just wanted to check in. Hey, just, just call me. Let me know you got in okay. All right? Bye. [blinker clicks] [sighs] License plate, not a match, possible stolen vehicle. Stand by for more. Oh, great. [knocking] Evening, ma'am. License and registration, please. Was I speeding? No, I pulled you over 'cause one of your headlights is out. It is? Oh, right. Uh. Uh, okay. Here's my license. Your vehicle registration, please. Right. I ran your plates. They don't match the description of the car. They don't? No, ma'am. Are you sure that you entered the plate number in right? The registration also shows a different plate number for the car. Well, I, it's my boyfriend's car, so there must be some mistake. [ominous music] Would you mind stepping out of the vehicle, please? [sighs heavily] Okay. [tense music] You been drinkin' tonight? Oh. [laughs nervously] I had one, one at work, because we closed a deal. But that, yeah, that's all. Just the one drink at work? No open containers? No, none. Okay, do you mind blowing into this for me. Fine, yeah, that's fine. [breathalyzer beeps] You are under the legal limit. Great, good. So can I go now? Ma'am, would you please stand there for me? I'm gonna search your car. Oh, okay. [Annie sighs] [music intensifies] [eerie tones] Can you come over here, please? Yeah. [gasps] Can you explain this? Uh. That, that's not, that's not mine. My boyfriend, he... What's his name? Oliver, Oliver Graham. I'm sure if we, um, if call him, he'd have some kind of an explanation. What happened here? Uh, he hit an animal yesterday. An animal? Yeah, an animal. [radio beeps] Dispatch unit 139 calling for an additional unit. Ma'am, I'd like to take you in, clear this up. What's gonna happen to the car? It'll be taken care of. Please come with me. [scoffs] Unbelievable. [faint chattering] Do you want somethin' to drink? I assume you're offering water. We have coffee too. Hey, how long's this gonna take? There's a detective who will talk with you soon. Perfect. [cellphone ringing] [sighs heavily] Okay. Oliver. Hey, I just got you message. Look, I should have called earlier, but the client's getting cold feet. Hey, I'm at a police station. Why, what, what happened? Are you okay? I... Was it an accident? Are you hurt? No, no. No, I was just, I was driving home, and I got pulled over because your headlight was out on your car. Hello? Hey Oliver, are you there? You were driving my car? Yeah, I was running late, and you parked behind me. You have your own car. Yeah, but you boxed me in again. And I, I didn't have time to rearrange the cars. So what, why does that matter anyway? Why are you at the police station? [ominous music] Your registration and your plates don't match. So I think that they believe that the vehicle's stolen. You had no right to take my car. You know what, they found, they found a knife too, okay. What are you talking about? And it had... It had blood on it. I don't know anything about that, Annie. What about the headlight. Look, I don't have time to deal with this. I'll deal with it when I get back. What? Oliver. Oliver? [cellphone beeps] Ms. Tatum, I'm Detective Reyes. Will you follow me, please. [sighs] Yes. What's your relationship with Garrett Campos? Who? You don't know who he is? He's the owner of the car you were driving. What? Is that him? Yeah. He's not your boyfriend? [laughs] No, no. Uh, my, my boyfriend is Oliver. Oliver Graham. Here you go. Not him. And where's he at? Oh, he's out of, he's on a work trip in Atlanta. Look, I, I haven't done anything wrong. We're just trying to fit the pieces together. We'll get through this quickly. We ran Oliver Graham through the DMV database, and three matches came up. One was 17-year-old kid, the second a 55-year-old construction foreman, and the last was a 35-year-old Korean man who changed his name because of, yeah, it doesn't matter. But none of these men match your boyfriend. Well, there must be some kind of glitch in your system. The VIN number matches the one that Campos reported stolen a couple of months ago. The license plates belong to an old van. So someone switched the plates to hide the fact that the car was stolen. Yeah, I, I don't know anything about all of that. [unsettling music] Tell me about the blood on the broken headlight. Oliver, he hit an animal. Are you sure? You sure you didn't hit anything? You did state that you had a drink. Yeah, I had one drink, and I, I passed the breathalyzer. Yes, Oliver said last night that he hit an animal. Were you with him at the time? No. [sighs] No, I was working from home. How does the knife fit into all this? I, I don't know. Maybe, um, maybe he used it on the animal to put it out of its misery. Most men I know don't carry kitchen knives in their cars. [music grows more tense] [detective whispers] Are we sure? Uh, this is my partner, Detective Scott. He just informed me that the blood on the knife is human. Maybe Oliver cut himself. Then wrapped the knife and just put it under the passenger seat? Look, this is no my car. All right, I have my own car. It's parked at home. You can, you can check. You'll see. We have. Great, then you realize all of this is a mistake, especially where I'm concerned. Look I, I would really like to go. Uh, I don't wanna make you aware that we have impounded your car. It's not my car. Well, the lab is going through it as we speak. I need you to stay in the city until we can clear up a few more of these questions. Fine. Fine. Okay. You're free to go. Right. Thank you. [crestfallen music] [scoffs] [sighs] [phone rings] This is Oliver. You know what to do. [voicemail beeps] Hey. It's me. Look, I, I really don't know what's going on. But just, can you, can you call me back? The police, they're asking me about... Just call me back. Please. [sighs] [phones rings] Hey Annie. Hey. Look, is it, is it too late? No, I'm just doing some work. You all right? Just been a long, long night. Hopefully it's nothing though. You wanna talk about it? Oliver, um... He's just, he's not callin' me back. Did you guys get in a fight? Something like that. Well, it's just, he... Hey. He'll call. Just give him some time. Sure. Yeah, sure. I'll just, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Goodnight. Bye. [sighs heavily] [phone rings] [electronic chiming] [Automated Service] We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check the number but try your call again. [uneasy music] [phone rings] [electronic chiming] [Automated Service] We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error... [phone beeps] [tense music] I'll send those up as soon as they arrive. You're welcome. Good morning, can I help you? Hi, yeah. I'm trying to get a hold of Oliver Graham. I haven't been able to reach him. Does he have another number I could call or... I'm sorry, who? Oliver Graham. G-R-A-H-A-M. Do you know what department he's in? Sales. I'm sorry, I'm not finding that name. Are you sure you're spelling it correctly? It's a Graham, like a cracker. I don't see it. Okay, uh, try again. First name Oliver. He said that he was going to the Atlanta office. Oh, but we don't have an office in Atlanta. And I'm not finding anyone with that name who works at any of our locations. [suspenseful music] Oliver, is that you? [music swells] [ominous tones] [floorboard creeks] [Annie gasps] [music intensifies] [startled gasping] Whoa! Put down the knife. Okay. Put down the knife. There's somebody inside my house. Okay, okay, these officers will do a sweep. Go, go. There's somebody in my home. Okay, okay, come on now. Come On. There's somebody... Okay, come on. I need you to calm down and listen for a second. Okay. What is going on? I have a warrant to search the home and the grounds. And I need to ask you a few more questions. What? Why? Come on. Am I gonna get that back? It looks like it's part of the same set the knife in the car same from. I, I really didn't get a good look at that yesterday. Now, you stated yesterday that your boyfriend's blood might be on the knife. Yeah. We had a John Doe come in yesterday. No, that can't him. Because, um, yeah, I, I talked to him yesterday. It's okay, it's okay. It's all clear, no one's inside. Thanks. I need you to take a look at a photo of the deceased. Yeah, no, that's not Oliver. Mm-mm, that's not him. Okay. Yesterday, you had a photo of your boyfriend. I'd like a copy of that, or whatever you might have on hand. Yeah, sure. Come on. Yeah, my phone's just right here. Okay, uh, so he... What? [scoffs] It's saying I have no photos. It's okay, there's one here. [Annie sighs] The picture's gone. The photo of your boyfriend? And someone erased all of those pictures from my phone. Why would someone do that? Look, I know that it sounds crazy, but someone was in here. Excuse me, detective. Yes? We found this. Blood? What? Is this your shirt? Yeah, but I... What else? Anything that points to her boyfriend? Some male clothes and toiletries, and some prints. Run it through all databases when you get back. Will do. Oh, and compare it to the vic, of course. I told you, that's not him. I know what you said. Oh. Okay. I need to ask you a few more questions down at the station. And the garage door is... Yeah. Okay. [unsettling music] [music swells] You still with me over there? Can I get somethin' to eat? Let's take a few steps back. You go by Annie Tatum. Yeah. But Tatum is your middle name. Your last name is actually Stein. I have my reasons for not going by Stein. So what? I'm just trying to understand the big picture. Tell me your exact whereabouts from two nights ago. I was at home cooking dinner. What time did you get home. 7:30. I came straight home from work. And where was your boyfriend? He called me on my way home. He said he was at home. And you haven't seen him since? I saw him for a little bit that night, but he said he had to go to work for a bit. But his work has no record of an Oliver Graham? Right, yes. And that, I don't understand why that is. Then he flew out to Atlanta? Mm-hmm. Do you know what airlines he flew out on? I don't know. I'd really like to talk to him. His number's been disconnected. Is this his number? Your phone records show you call it frequently. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Is there anyone else that can vouch for your boyfriend? What do you mean? Everyone we've talked to doesn't know Oliver. There's evidence of someone else in your home, but the prints aren't in our system. So they can belong to anyone. They're Oliver's. I already told you that. How long have you known him? Three, maybe, maybe four months. And how'd you meet? We met at the rooftop cafe downtown, off Wylie Street. I was there, he bumped into me. He made me spill my drink, and he felt really bad about it. So we sat down, and we hit it off. Thank you. Tell me somethin', Annie. You're smart, independent. You've got to see this isn't adding up. We have a victim, hit by a car and stabbed to death. Then there's you in a stolen car with a bloody knife and a missing boyfriend as an alibi. How do we know you're not sending us on some wild goose chase? I have to go by the evidence. And it shows that your prints are on the knife. I think I need a lawyer. And a pen and paper, please. Sure. [unsettling music] Do you think she's holding out? I don't know. I've given her every chance the explain, but she's not doin' herself any favors. Did we find anything on the flight records for an Oliver Graham. No. Maybe he's our John Doe. None of the prints at her house match him. Maybe she has a partner. She's either protecting him, or maybe she did it. DA says if anything else comes up, he'll pull the trigger on this. Pull the trigger on what? Who are you? Jacob Lostray. I've been asked to represent Annie Tatum on legal troubles on behalf of her firm. Well, that was fast. So where's my client? Ms. Tatum is being held as a person of interest in a murder investigation of a John Doe that came in a couple days ago. So what is she doing? I have no idea. Okay, well, it seems like everything you have here is circumstantial. The lab is running tests on everything that we have. And until you get the lab results back, are you really gonna hold her? No. We have a murder weapon and a vehicle, both with human blood. But you don't know whose blood that is. And as my client stated to the officer, it's her boyfriend's car, not hers. Assuming there is a boyfriend. You know, the DA's been gettin' slammed because of the numerous mistakes this department continues to make. Hey. So I'm guessing he's gonna wanna make sure that this is pretty solid before he moves on it. So you're not gonna charge her. Fingerprints show that she handled the knife. The knife comes from her home. Yes, there's gonna be fingerprints. How about DNA? Is Annie's DNA anywhere? Under the victim's fingernails? Are their scratches on Ms. Tatum anywhere? No? Okay then. You know we can hold her for 48 hours. Yeah, but you not going to. You're free to go. Who are you? Your attorney. Your firm thought you could use some help. Oh, I didn't know that my firm even knew I... Mr. Stein sent me. Here's my card. If you have any problems, give me a call. Otherwise, I don't want you talking to Detective Reyes, or Detective Scott, or anyone here. All right. Who's this? Oliver. Well, you draw very nicely. Thank you. Maybe start with this before you come after my client. [uneasy music] What do you think, Scott? I don't know if there's a boyfriend. [Automated Service] We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Let's get Johnson on Tatum... If you feel that... [phone beeps] For a couple days. We'll see what comes from it. [crestfallen music] Annie. Why are you here? Why am I here? Annie, I should have been your first call. I can handle it. I only found out when the police showed up and started talking to everybody at the office. Your assistant, Jerry. Okay, I called Mr. Lostray and sent him over when I discovered that the police had taken you in. Don't make it sound like I was arrested, okay. And you didn't have to do anything. If anyone else had sent him over, you'd be grateful. [sighs heavily] Annie, let me help. I wish it were that simple. [affecting music] And I'm tired, so if you could... Okay. I'll go. But are you gonna be okay? I'll figure it out. [poignant music] [Annie sighs] I'm surprised you didn't get rid of him sooner. [Annie screams] Annie, hey. Where have you been? Did you miss me that much? No, don't do that. Ow. What? Where were you? I... No, I called and I called and I called. Okay, shh. Okay, shh, shh, shh. No. I went down to your office. They haven't even heard of you. Your phone... Okay. Your phone is disconnected. The cops, they, they think that I have killed someone. Annie, please. No, and you have no right to be mad at me about your car. Okay. Because you hid something... Okay, hey, hey, hey. In the backseat... Hey, hey, hey, hey. That I didn't even know... Just breathe, okay. Breathe. Breathe, okay. Look, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be all right. Got it? What is going on? What I'm about to tell you is gonna sound crazy. But I need you to be patient and just listen. Fine. You know, if you hadn't driven my car, they wouldn't have figured anything out. We'd be fine. Is this seriously what you're going to tell me? I've been questioned over and over about the murder of a guy that I don't even know, that you obviously have something to do with. So you better start talking fast, or I am gonna call the police. Okay, okay. Look, my name isn't Oliver. I thought you were gonna take this seriously. My name isn't Oliver Graham. It's Ben. Awhile ago I took some things, I stole them. And now the guys that I was working with, they want everything back. So now you're a thief? Okay. [sighs] Geez, look, I didn't want it to go that way. Just, just let me explain. What, that these guys want their stuff back? These guys that you're working for? Yeah, well, I kind of bolted before I gave them their cut. So you've been lying to me this entire time? About what I do, yeah. But I do care about you. I, I love you. And that's why I'm back here. And that's why I came back. What happened the other night? They showed up and rang the doorbell. Yeah, you said it was that colleague of yours that had the crisis in Atlanta. Look, when they showed up, I panicked, okay. I grabbed the first thing that I could think of: the knife. I didn't have a chance to use it, 'cause I opened the door and they threw me against the wall, and they threatened to kill me if I didn't tell them where the paintings were. Paintings? Yeah. Nice ones. I can't believe this. I screwed up. [Annie scoffs] Robins and Palmer, they're not, they're not forgiving guys. You were on your way home, and I didn't want you to be in danger. So I took 'em to a warehouse where I told 'em I had the paintings. And when they realized I didn't have 'em there, they attacked me. Look, I had the knife, and I had to defend myself. Did you, did you kill them? One of them, Palmer. Robins is still alive. I managed to get away, and I came here. You left town, and you let me take the fall for it. I wanted to lay low so Robins couldn't find me. And then I came back. Why? Why did you come back? Because I needed your help. Look, I had nowhere else to go. I, I wanted to make sure that you were safe. Okay. Do you know where we're gonna go? We're gonna go to the police. I can't do that. It was self-defense. Yeah, well, I stole some things too, Annie. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to deal with that. No. I'm clean right now. I don't have a record, and I'm gonna keep it that way. Did you take that picture of us off the fridge. I thought that'd be better. For you. You came in my house. Did you, did you mess with my phone? I can only say sorry so many times. Okay, well, a few more would be helpful. Do you want me to go to the police? You need to. Okay, I'll go. But we have to do something first. I hid the paintings in these tubes, but one's missing. Where are the others? They're safe. Are you gonna return them? Yeah. Maybe I can negotiate for a lesser sentence or protection from Robins when I, one's missing, it's not here. And you're sure that it's in a tube. Yeah, look, I put 'em in the trunk of my car. When one came up missing, I figured it got mixed with these. I took a bunch of tubes to the office when I borrowed your car. Where are those tubes now? They're at the office. Okay, let's go. No, no. Annie, please, this is important. Oh yeah, the paintings, they're important. But not a word to me, hmm? I know it seems that way. Look, when, I was hoping I could leave this part of my life behind, that we could move on and be happy. After the office, you'll go to the police? Straight there. [suspenseful music] Oh no, no, no, no. Go, go, go, go. What, what? Turn right here, right here. That's him. Who? Robins. The guy you didn't kill? Just park where he can't see us. What is doing here? I don't know, I'm, I'm sorry. He must think you have something to do with the paintings. Oh. We've gotta figure out how to get in without him seeing us. [tense music] Here. I got an idea. Meet me out front. [women laughing] [women chattering softly] I told all this to the officer yesterday. And I appreciate that. But I'd like to go over it anyway. Any disputes? Any red flags at all? No, I'm telling you, Annie is solid. And the boyfriend, ever met him? No. But Annie's a private person. The assistant hasn't met him either. So? We're trying to corroborate his identify. Look, this whole thing sounds like a big misunderstanding. That's not how we classify it when someone's a prime suspect in a murder investigation. You're kidding, right? Well, good morning, Ms. Tatum. Hi, Jerry. Sorry, I had no idea they would be bothering you again. [cellphone buzzing] Excuse me, I have to take this. This thing is such a mess. Where is your attorney? I know, I got, I have his number. It's in here. Are we sure? Got it. Thanks. That was my partner. Annie Tatum, you're under arrest for the murder of John Doe. What? This is ridiculous, I just... You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. Okay, call my lawyer, Jerry! Let's go. I'll call him. [unsettling music] Come on. [Annie groans] Take a really good look at him. You know him, don't you? I want my lawyer. I just wanna know why you killed him. I didn't do it. I'll wait for my attorney. Yeah, Lostray, you lucked out with him. No doubt about it. But as luck would have it, he's in court all day today. That's how good he is, always savin' the high-priced clientele. Okay, well, then I guess we're done, right? Thank you. Oh, the lab results came back from the blood in the car and on the knife. Guess whose blood it is? I... Our John Doe. Oh, and before your lawyer claims it was just a coincidence, the blood on the sleeve of your shirt, also his. I was wiping a smudge off my doorway. I didn't know it was blood. [chuckles] Yes, murder can be messy. I didn't do it, all right. Oliver is back and he... He did it? So turn him in. I don't know where he is. See, I think you're just trying to cast suspicion anywhere but on you. But if this boyfriend of yours exists and is involved, you're lookin' like an accessory to murder, if not a full-blown partner in crime. Look, there are some things that I would like to tell you, but I need to consult with my lawyer first. That's fine. But you can talk to your lawyer down at county lock-up. You'll be there until your arraignment. Or you can stay here and confess. No? Then Officer Grady here will show you to your accommodations while you wait for transport to take you to country, or your lawyer shows up. [disheartening music] Yes, I will make sure you get that in time. Hi, Jessie, you have something for me? Oh, yes. Here's a message for you. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, Ms. Tatum isn't available. I'll leave her word. Mr Stein? Yes. How's Annie? What do you mean? Haven't you heard? I've been off-site all day. What are you talking about? The police arrested her. [affecting music] Prison transport's here. What about my attorney? Sorry, he hasn't come yet. [music grows tense] Chance, Ms. Tatum. No, please. You know it's only a matter of time before we ID John Doe. Wait, listen. Maybe that'll point to why you killed him. I didn't do it! There's too much evidence to take your word for it. Please, it, it wasn't me! Watch your head. [groans] It wasn't! Let's go. Hi, excuse me, detective. Mr. Stein. Hi, where's Annie? Your daughter is on her way to booking. What? You can visit her at county. [suspenseful music] [engine revving] What's wrong? [radio beeps] Dispatch, this is Transpo 42 requesting police escort on Route 33 heading northbound to county. [excited shouting] [radio drowned out by shouting] Yeah! Oh yeah! [men laughing] Woo! Yeah! Woo-hoo-hoo! Dispatch, cancel that last request. You're a bit antsy tonight. Man, I just wanna get home and see the... [tires screeching] Bruce! [glass crashing] [metal crunching] [gasping] [pained shouting] [metal crashing] [gasping] [frustrated growling] [keys jangling] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [pained groaning] Hello? Is anyone... Hello? Okay, look, don't, don't move, all right. I'll get some help. [squishing] [groaning] [glass clinking] [grunting] [radio beeps] Hello? [radio static crackles] Hello? Hello? There's been an accident. We, we need an ambulance. An officer is hurt. Please. [screams] [tense music] Get up! Consider this a favor. No, let me go! Let me go! [groaning] [thudding] Go! Run! [heart-pounding music] Annie. Oh, Annie. Come back here! [music swells] [Annie cries out] [Annie groans] Oh, Annie. He swindled us, you know. Probably thinks he deserves it just because he got the blueprints to the vault. You can't trust him. You help me get the paintings back, I'll leave you alone. [suspenseful music] [Annie breathes heavily] [twig snapping] [groaning] [thudding] [blow cracks] [grunting] [Robins coughs] [blow thuds] [Robins groans] [music intensifies] Annie. Annie! [car rushing] [tires screeching] Annie, get in! Stop, Ben! [gun banging] All right, we're okay. We're okay. Are you shot? Uh, it's just a, it's a from, um, cut from the wreck. All right, you'll be okay. All right, we gotta get outta this part of town. The police are gonna be everywhere with your escape. Wait, where are we going? Here, hang onto this in case we split up. All right, for now the painting must be safe in your office. Maybe we can break in tonight. But the police, you said you were gonna... Yeah, I think we can avoid them. You said you would go straight there. After we got the painting. But the police are gonna be coming after me, Oliver. One thing at a time, Annie. Yeah, is that one thing the painting? Don't start. [Annie groans] I need some bandages. We'll get you your bandages! I am bleeding here, Oliver. Just calm down, okay. Trust me. I just saved you. So I think maybe a thank you would be in order. Thank you? You know what, I wouldn't be in any of this mess if I hadn't have met you. I'm the one who's trying to help us, all right. All you're doing is blaming me for everything. Well, you're the only one to blame, all right. You stole a car. You murdered someone. Are you even thinking about us, or is it just about the stupid painting? [tires screech] [Annie gasps] Just shut up. Before you make me do something we're both gonna regret. [music swells] Annie! [suspenseful music] [Annie whimpers] Annie, get back here! [distant sirens wailing] [tires screech] So much for getting home at a decent hour. Do we know where Tatum is? Nothing yet. What about the escort? Driver's dead. Officer Grady's critical. [sighs] Where'd this happen? Route 33, just north of county. Found 'em. All right. [unsettling music] [Annie groans] Okay. Oh, good. Okay. Right. Right. Okay. Good. All right. Okay. [grunts] [breathes heavily] Okay. [suspenseful music] Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. [sighs] [fabric ripping] [groans] Okay. I made it. [groans] Okay. [grunts] Mr. Lostray, I know you're on another case right now, but my daughter is in jail. You haven't returned my calls. You haven't shown up. We need your attention immediately. So please. [intercom buzzes] Call me back. [intercom buzzes] Yes? Police, Mr. Stein. We need to talk to you. [Stein sighs heavily] [intercom beeps] She hasn't called, reached out? No. Are you sure? She wouldn't reach out to me anyway. She would if she had nowhere else to go. She's innocent in this, you know. Mr. Stein, I have met many parents who talk about somebody as being innocent, that she would never do such a thing. But that's only true until she does. Maybe for other people. But I know my daughter, and she has an unwavering sense of right and wrong. That's not proof that will exonerate her. [gentle music] [sighs] I had an affair once, some time ago, with a woman that I met in a small town where I used to do business. And it went on for some time. And then my wife found out about it. And it destroyed her. She got sick. And before we ever had a chance to patch it up, she passed. [soft poignant music] It was easier not to talk to Annie about it. But when she found out, well, there aren't words to describe... She cut me out of her life. She changed her last name. She wouldn't see me, until I finally convinced my company to offer her a job that she couldn't refuse. And so now I see her every day. But it's just another painful reminder of what I did to drive us apart. She still hasn't forgiven me. She once told me that it would be an injustice to her mother. So you think she did it. But your prime suspect is a person with a strong moral compass. Compasses break. [tense music] Annie? Annie? Are you here? [music grows ominous] No more running. Oliver. [music swells] [knocking] Oh my gosh, Annie. [Annie moans] Are you okay? You're all over the news. [groans] Yeah. Here, sit down. What do you need? Uh, can I just get, uh, something to drink? Yeah. You're hurt. We need to get you to the hospital. Your lawyer's been calling. You need help. No, I can't do any of that. I just need, I need bandage or something. [groans] Okay, tell me what's goin' on. My ride was crashed on the way to jail. By who? Um, whoever was coming after Oliver. They're coming after me now. Where's Oliver? I don't know. I just ran away from him. Um. Why? [Annie sighs] I put the rest of the bandages in the medicine cabinet. You sure your leg is all right? For now. [sighs] So what next? I gotta prove I had nothin' to do with that murder. What about Oliver? He stole a painting. His partner, he said something to me about plans for a vault. A vault? Didn't we have a client who had a vault robbed? The Murphy building. Oh my word, that was my project. [Annie scoffs] The vault is not a common known part of the building. It's estimated that paintings worth $75 million were stolen by thieves. 75 million. He knew I had those plans. He sought me out so he could get the blueprints to the Murphy building. I am such an idiot. No, Annie. We don't know that. No, don't defend him, okay. The city didn't even have plan with the vault on it. The Murphys wanted to keep all of that under wraps. He's, he got close to me so he could rob the vault. What now? [uneasy music] He's gonna want that painting. It's at the office, and we gotta get to it first. Otherwise I'll have no way of clearing my name. [knocking] Ma'am, it's the police. Annie. I need you to open up, please. Hurry, go. Go to the office, all right. Find the painting. It's gotta be in a tube that I gave you the other day. But then what? [sighs] Uh. Karen Bowers. Put it in dumpster, all right. I'll be close by. What? I'll be close by, it'll be fine. Can I help you? Is everything all right? Yeah, I was just working out. Got some stills from the dash cam of the prison transport. Oh, what about the video itself? Wreck messed it up. We're workin' on it, but that's what we got so far. All right, thanks. Who are you? And how do you fit into all this? [mischievous music] What? [gasps] [mumbles] Zero, two. [cellphone buzzing] [phone ringing] Come on. Come on. [sighs] Good morning. Hi. How can I help you? Uh, we have an appointment. [tense music] Um, sorry, I don't see your appointment. Ah, well, we're not picky. Can you just see if anybody's available? Uh, let me go check. Would you like try to have a seat? Yeah. I sure hope this works. [sighs] You just remember, I'll distract 'em, you look for the painting. Mm-hmm. Where is is? [suspenseful music] [cellphone buzzing] [sighs] [phone ringing] Hey. It's me. Look, I, I need you to get a message to my assistant, now. [tense music] [music swells] What? I'm pretty sure that's Annie's assistant. [music quickens] Oh, hey, I got a hold of... Uh, yeah, you know, I'm gonna have to reschedule. Okay. [suspenseful music] [music swells] Okay. [gasps] [groans] Okay. Clever, getting your assistant to help out. Hand it over. And then what will you do. Give me the painting, now. [Robins sighs] You know, you seem like a good person. You really wanna be responsible for his death? Please. No. Then stop stalling. Give me the painting. It's okay, Annie. It's gonna be fine. Just give it to him. Do it. Now! Put down the weapon. [groaning] [tense music] You got him? Tatum, stop right there! [Annie grunts] Okay. [music swells] [music intensifies] [door slams] Oh my god. Okay. [music quickens] Stop! [Annie groans in pain] Dispatch, I'm in the Powell parking garage, south of 10th. Folks, folks, I need you to go back inside, please. Go back inside, please. Thank you. [Annie breathes raggedly] [music swells] Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. I wasn't sure you were gonna make it to Karen in time. Well, I barely caught her. [tense music] She decided to go to the dumpster with a decoy just to keep up appearances so those men saw her. All this trouble. Let me help. You already have. I can do more. You're in over your head. I know. I mean, I've got money. You could get away. I've got a place where you can hide. Thanks, but that's not what I want. It's temporary. I'll hire a private investigator. I'll do everything I can to clear your name. Look, I got myself into this mess, and I need to get myself out. [Stein sighs] And what about the police? I could use your help with that. We know it was you who crashed into that prisoner's transport last night. You killed an officer, injured another, and aided a fugitive in an escape, minimum. It's time you started digging yourself out of this hole. I'm giving you a chance the explain what happened. Lawyer. Can I just shoot him? Does his ID check out? [sighs heavily] Tanner Robins. He's got a burglary charge that he served six months for and a couple of assault charges that didn't stick. We know it was him from last night. Why was he at Tatum's work? This is the best angle outside the alley of the architect building. Start where Detective Scott confronts them. That's Robins. Yeah. Do we have a better view of the other guy? No, I can fiddle with it some more, but it'll take some time. Okay. He comes out of the building with Robins. What about when they came in? There. Yeah. Who is that? I don't know. He looks familiar. No, I've seen him before. [uneasy music] [music intensifies] What the hell? The boyfriend. Detectives. Hi, excuse me. Mr. Stein. My daughter asked me to contact you. You've talked with her? I hope you don't have plans for this evening. We don't have a lot of time. [affecting music] [cellphone beeps] Annie, are you all right? Hey, I barely got away. The police got Robins. Call me, please. This changes things in our favor. [Annie sighs] [cellphone buzzing] Annie? I have the painting. Are you all right? Yes. Where are you? Just on the edge of town. Thought I'd lay low. I was waiting for you to call. Let me pick you up. We'll leave the city, go anywhere you want. What about my life, hmm? You said that you would turn yourself in. If that's what you really want. Look, just tell me where you're at. We'll work everything out. I'm at the rooftop cafe. Where we met. Okay, I'm on my way. [trunk slams] [unsettling music] I should've brought flowers. How's the leg? It's been better. You were clever back there, the office. You kept the painting safe. How did Robins find you? [Oliver sighs] I went back to your house thinkin' you'd be there. He was there waiting. But that's behind us now. Not really. I'm still in the thick of it. Yeah. Look, about the police, I can't do it. You want me to go to jail instead? No, of course not. Well, then turn yourself in. Clear my name. There's another way. [emotional music] We leave town tonight, go wherever we want. Start over fresh. Why? Because I love you. [scoffs] No, you don't. The only reason you dated me is because you needed access to the plans for the Murphy building. [sighs] I do love you. I mean, why else do you think I'd still be here? Because I loved you. And I gave you a free place to stay. You, you bumped into me. We met. That, that was your plan, that was on purpose. The job was over three months ago. I could've left. I didn't want to. I didn't want to be away from you. I love you. Then answer me this question. Yeah? Why'd you kill the other guy. The guy, Palmer. The police said that you hit him with your car. But you stabbed him? You had to finish him off? I managed to knock out Robins right away. But Palmer just, just kept coming at me. I was scared, I felt I had to do it. I, I'm not some monster, Annie. You know that, right? [low tense music] Please. Come on. Come with me. I can't. I can't leave my friends, my work, my father. Your father. We both know you can't stand him. He represents everything you hate. All his pathetic attempts to make up for what he did? We've been together a couple months, and I've heard at least a million times how he's unfaithful, a liar, manipulative, scum of the earth. And what are you? What, you think I'm like him? No. He's changed. And you've lied to me the entire time. [Oliver sighs] Okay. You don't wanna go, I won't force you. But I need that painting. Open it. What? You don't trust me? Just wanna be safe. Okay, shouldn't you go up there? No, she's doin' just fine. Careful. [sighs] It's beautiful, isn't it? It better be. Give it to me. Hm-mm. Come on. Now. [Annie gasps] That's what I thought. [music turns ominous] Where did you get a gun? She needs help. Go. Mr. Stein, I need you to stay here. You know, last week, last week I thought I wanted to marry you. But now all I want is a confession. You set me up? [tense music] [blow cracking] [blow thudding] [Oliver groans] [Annie gasps] Come 'ere! [groaning] Let's not fight, sweetie. You've never seen me fight. [Annie shouts] [Oliver cries out] [music intensifies] [Annie shouts] [table crashes] [Oliver grunts] You were the perfect cover. Stay home and play house. You didn't expect a thing. But you weren't worth it. Stuck-up little princess, 'cause daddy didn't meet your expectations. You naive? Or just plain stupid? [music intensifies] [Annie gasps] [groaning] [thudding] [chairs crashing] Stop! [gun bangs] Give me the painting, Annie. Now. [suspenseful music] [Annie grunts in effort] No! [Oliver groans] [chair cracking] [Oliver cries out] Help! Annie! Annie, baby. Please, help me. How naive do you think I am? Baby, I'm sorry. Just help me, please. Ms. Tatum. I don't need the painting. Help me, Annie. Annie, get back. Just lower me something, please, come on. Annie, where are you going? Come back. Give me your hand. What about the painting? Don't worry about it. Come on. [grunting] Oliver Graham, or Ben, or whatever your name is, you are under arrest for the murder of John Doe, a.k.a. Palmer. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. [Annie exhales deeply] [poignant music] You all right? You need a doctor or anything? I'll live. Let's get someone to check you out anyway. Okay. Annie! Thank you. [faint speaking] There are some things that'll need to be cleared up in the next few days, especially with the robbery component. But I suspect Robins will help with that after he has time to think about his situation. So with that, you're free to go, Ms. Tatum. I'm not a murder suspect anymore? I don't think that'll be an issue. [sighs in relief] Okay. You gonna be all right? Yes, yeah, thank you. [soft affecting music] So? Can I give you a ride home? I'd like that. I'll bring the car around. [music grows tense] Dad? [music turns emotional] I'll come with you. [tense music] [music swells]
