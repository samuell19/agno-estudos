There're no other signs of violence on Major Kraikov's body. - When did you arrive? - Today. - When're you going back? - Today. - How's it down in the Crimea? - It's warm. See ya! I called to tell you that... - You have an enemy in the KGB. - Who? I don't know, but your major's death is a signal. You're making a mountain... He couldn't hang himself, in his office, during the day. - He could've shot himself. - You're right. It's obvious. Why did they transfer him? To Moscow? For what good deeds? To try and dig under you. It isn't so easy to dig under me, Kolya. March forward! We need an excuse for you being here. Anything'll do. For example, to change your driver. What about this one? Driver? - Why'd you need him? - Transfer him for me. All right. THE CRIMEA. Cleaning time. My name's Lida. Go ahead, Lida. Finish this. The master's leftovers. - Have you settled down? - Yes, Sir. Send him for Vera. - I've come for Serova. - She's outside already. Take her things. I can't forgive myself for missing you. My rule is: Everything on time. That's why my idol is Gagarin and Exupery. Easy, soldier, don't drive so fast. Will do. Actually I'm a sergeant. Name's Victor. I'll help you around. - Around where? - Well, I don't know... To fulfill your wishes, guard you. Anything. Since you're young and beautiful. - What? - Excuse me? - You looking at me in the mirror? - By accident. You mad? A servant can't hurt my feelings. But only speak when asked. Will do. Closer! - Leave it here. Repair the sconce. - What? The lamp. My daughter's in the hospital! What were you doing there? - Is this an interrogation? - Answer me, I'll find out anyway. No problem - I had an abortion. - What? - An abortion. Only the doctor said it was too late. Nice. Who is it? Who? - Tell me, who? - No one. I don't remember. Just some guy. Then have an abortion, if you don't remember! And don't disgrace me! Tell me, who! Anyone. I'm not in great demand, with my looks and all. Your looks are fine, he'll think he's fortunate. I must know, who is it? It's no joking matter. Major Kraikov, your deputy. Happy now? You said this on purpose? You know he's dead already. Believe it or not. I don't have time. Right now, just go. - Been a driver for long? - Since before I joined the Army. What are your plans for the future? Well, you know... I plan to go to the Army Academy. For top officers. - What about your dad and mom? - He's an orphan. - Are you married? - No, Sir. In good time, as people say. Right. You needn't hurry. My respect. Wait a sec. Call the hospital and summon this doctor. Send him straight to me. Vitya, what music do you prefer? Elvis Presley. - Isn't he old-fashioned. - Well... I like him, twist music and Italian songs. - Plus Soviet songs, of course. - Of course. I couldn't not examine her. I thought you knew. - You could've asked me. - It never crossed my mind. Never mind. What can we do now? At this month, an abortion'll mean she'll never bear a child again. - Are you qualified enough? - You can't be serious? For 20 years I've been gazing... into you know what! I studied in Moscow, at Liberman's. You can enquire about me. - Ok then, write and sign. - What? Why? Why all these formalities? I'll do anything You order me to. - Write what the baby will need. - Who will need? The baby. Diapers, vitamins, whatever. Of course. Are you getting tired? Of course not, Captain. I eat, get gas and steer my wheel to the rhythm of rumba. Good for you. I've some business for you. You'll be an informer: You know, who says what and does what. - About the general too? - About everybody. It's just a formality But it has to be done. You'll write: This did so and so. - Got it? - Yes, Sir. All right. But can I do this orally? - Why? - I make mistakes. Mistakes... You'll get bad grades for mistakes. What about breakfast? - Zina tried her best. - I've no time. Tell this moron driver to drive over here. And make it fast. - Where did I put them? - I'll be with you till 2. If I'm late, they'll have my head. You won't be late. Open the gates! Angela lvanovna! It's Vera Sergeevna. Let me show you how to do this. Do it gracefully, Carefully - Hello. - Hi, Angela. Are you nuts, you know I sleep at this hour. I'm sorry Angela, but I need you urgently. Take a walk, soldier. Is this your driver? Nice, good shoulders. I need a doctor, urgently. What're you, expecting? When? On the ship? During my birthday party? Never mind that. Got it. The place's a shithole, but they don't ask questions. Don't stand in the line, go straight in. Do it right now, 'cause Tomorrow he's leaving. To the right. Kostya, it's me. I'm all right. The fever has gone down, the tests'll be tomorrow. - May I come in? - Reception hours are over. It's very urgent. What're you, shameless? Take your coat off. I didn't find the cloakroom. I'm from Angela, The admiral's daughter, you probably remember. Your sunglasses too. The door. Did you pee? - What? - I said, did you pee? I don't understand. Look, I'm asking you about urine, okay? First about the beach, I didn't get it. Yes, I did. Take off your clothes. What ward is this, dear? It's obstetrics, dear. Your pelvis's bent, 'cause of the leg. Just warning you. It's a late pregnancy. A difficult case. It's up to you. I'm ready. Tomorrow, at 7 a.m. If you're late, I won't receive you. I have a train ticket to vacation. Bring a towel and underwear. And money, of course. That's it. Oh, and this' a state hospital, no anesthesia. Everything clear? Shall I help you? Help me? Let's go. Wait here, soldier. Damn! Sit still, don't move. Jump. Vera, you leave me guessing when you'll come this month. Go over to the gate. Vera, I'm here. My dear girl, what a nice sweater and scarf. You almost walk straight. Did you bring it? Wait, aunt, I need to talk to you. All right. But it's too ugly here. Give me the bottle. Aunt, I have a problem. I don't know what to do. Let me have a drink first! My soul's burning! No! You're out of it after vodka. - I don't have! I forgot it! - You're lying. I'm not lying. Well, your mother'd never forget vodka. Never. - Oh, my 'mother'... - The ring! - Where's your grandma's ring? - I lost it. Go on, shoot me for this! - It's a bad sign, dear. - A bad sign? - I'll tell you something scary. - I don't want you too! - I have to make up my mind today. - I have to go for dinner. Are you serious? I must go. We have pancakes today. My life is being ruined! I'm in trouble. - What do you mean pancakes? - With kissel. Stop here.(in Russian) Stop here. To the suburbs. - What? - I'm thinking about you. About me? And? If someone hurts you, I'll tear his head off. You'll take me to the hospital tomorrow. Mum's the word. You wanted to see me, General? Tell me where did you take Vera. Oh Lord, help me! - It's so beautiful here. - What? I said, it's beautiful. The mountains. The sea. Our orphanage had a picture book: 'The bluest in the world'. - Do you agree with me? - About what? That we have the prettiest sea, And prettiest women. French women aren't even a comparison. Oh, Paris, O love! But their moans are fake. What? I said, they act out their passion. Did you have an affair? I judge them by films. Where are you taking me? Stop the car! What? I'm doing as I was told to. I told you we were going to the hospital. - I was told to bring you here. - Turn around! - Who told you? - Damn, the engine's dead. The radiator is boiling. Who ordered you to come here? My boss is the general. He said you should swim. You swim! Take me to the town, immediately! Why don't you take a swim, the car has to cool down anyway. What's going on, eh. Don't you understand - I'm late! There's no way! Why? Because of the gas? No, because it's just bad for you. Easy. Calm down. Cool it! You're ruined, soldier. It'll be barracks and a prison for you now. Get rid of that bastard. - Who? - That boor! The driver! You're not a grenade-launcher. What happened? What? He... he wanted to rape me! All right, if he's to blame - he'll be punished. But he can be gotten rid of any time. What? Wait! Did you tell me the truth about Kraikov? Tell me! I'll cut off my finger if you don't get rid of that driver! Come on. To hell with them all. Close the door. - How's your service? - Everything's ok, Sir. Still thinking of being a general? I don't know, comrade General. You and Vera have to make up. So screw it, if it's not my fate. Sorry for disturbing you, comrade General. But I'm just doing my duty. You gonna interrogate me, major? Of course not, General! Then you could've come to my place. All right, let's not pettifog. I have a couple of questions concerning the MT-35 warship which sank in the spring of 1957. - What? - How did this incident happen? Read the files of the governmental investigation, of course, if you have the clearance to. I have the clearance. And I have these files right here. As a result of the fire the ship overturned and like a pot, covered the crew. They knocked on the plating from the inside until they suffocated from the smoke. Is this true? Yes, if it's written there. You were a colonel then, chief of the coast guard. Tell me, why didn't the firemen put the fire out? We didn't let them. There was a reason for this. You mean the 'X' cargo? Containers with uranium waste? What do you want, Major? Who ordered you to not let the firemen in? You? Formally yes. But in fact in was Colonel Lavrenko. - KGB General Lavrenko. - He was a colonel then. - Could you dispute his order? - Yes. But he had more authority and he issued an order. - There's no such order in the file. - So? No written order means you are responsible for the death of people, for the wreck, and for the contamination of the water. That written order probably exists. Major Kraikov implied this. Did he really know? - Go and ask him. - It's too late now. What about you? He was your friend, wasn't he. For 5 years no one fucking cared for those men and the ship. What has changed? Times have changed. The country and the Party are renewing themselves. Wow, they even keep chicken here. Living a nice life, eh. Let's go! You washed it, not long ago. Bugs crash in to it. - I like the car to be neat. - Bugs? Where? Lida, take it easy. The car can run you over not screw you. No kidding? So, I aimed for the sky, eh. - Did you have a nice sleep? - A boring one. - Did you drive the master? - Of course. Take a break then. I need a man's help. Glad to help. I'm waiting. Put it on. It fits you well. You think so? So, I'll be a general one day. You'll have to wait a long time. Although... Marry his daughter - and you'll be a major in no time. - Really? - Of course. Happens all the time. That's why they took you. Didn't you know? Or you won't fall for a lame girl? The orchestra plays a march on the harbor. A boat with the Commander of the Black Sea Fleet is heading towards the Admiral Golovko and Mikhail Kutuzov cruiser. On Navy Day the stands are full of Sevastopolites, guests of the city and the best people of our country: The region's and city's governors, chiefs of the Army and Navy, survivors of the Great Patriotic War. Black Sea sportsmen, are here for the 'Star race' those - best prepared for both army and political tactics. The fleet and submarines are the great Soviet state's stronghold and security. Comrades! Congratulations, It's Navy Day! It's Navy Day! I would like to present to each of you a napkin. - Thank you. - Gauze napkins. A lighter for you. Call me when you have a drink. Where are you going? Wait! What kind of boat? The admiral's boat? Like during Angela's birthday? - You should know better. - Why? - I said no. - I've important business there. Don't get in my way! I see. All right. You'll go with Victor. A convoy? So, it was not Kraikov? It's very important for me to know. No. Leave me alone. - Did you tell anyone else? - No. - Try to remember. - No one. It's nonsense. Look, I bought it for my son. At the department store. My wife said: Buy shoes for our oldest and youngest son. But they had only a little size. What do you think? Victor! Put on civilian clothes. You're going with Vera. Harness your horses guys, and recline in your beds. I will walk out into my garden to admire flowers... Shashlyk! Rokhes! Leave Angela alone. Do you have good cigars in Cuba? We've all kinds of things in Cuba. Only you have nothing to eat. Mind your mouth. Never mind these drunken fools. Better you dance with the Readhead. Leave me alone. Come on! - You're a quiet one. - Why? I've never seen you before. Are you an officer? In what corpse? Secret corpse. Shall we kiss? They won't understand us. So, you run away? I'm on duty here. Leave me alone, Rojes. - Come on. - He doesn't dance. Oh, really? Why's that? - Because he's a servant. - What? - A servant. He's my driver. - Oops. Why do you need a driver on the boat? What's he steering, eh? Come on. Shall I call her back? I can arrange your fate. Arrange your own happiness first. Wait. Are you crazy? What am I, your fiance? I don't even remember your name. Stop the car! Pull up! - I was driving carefully. - Leave! Leave! Don't lower your head, so it doesn't go up your nose. And we were expecting you for breakfast. - Easy. - Dinner's cold, have to heat it. Did you not get high enough on celebration? Close the door. You thinking about dating my daughter, sergeant? You know Vera's condition? I see you know. It's all right with me if you like her, but only if you're serious. Or else, I'll smash you. You're a serious guy. With some help you'll rise in the world. Lida! Lay the table for three. I didn't have time to do this in the morning. My congratulations. Oh, Victor, your so quiet. Are all me really like this. And then you call us bitches. Move your feet. And I feel for you. Makin' love with a lame girl, ha. For a general's ration. Wait 'till you'll drop out a window. - Watching a play with servants? - Who's a servant? Have you no sense of humor? I underestimated you. You sure found an approach Vera. Come on Captain. You're no tattle-tale. Only you've complicated things. - What? - You'll know soon. Captain, I wanted to tell you... - Maybe I shouldn't do all this. - What exactly? Well, you know... ...writing all this stuff. It's a bad thing to do. - You wanna get out of it? - No. I just feel like some... Writing this stuff and living in this house. It's not decent. No problem. Of course, if you were a stranger. But now Vera, she... A joke! Go ahead, write, Dostoevsky. Are you cold? You have gooseflesh. What is this? Did you scald yourself? You're too curious for a servant. Let's go, I'm real cold. Pay the check. Good night! The tea there and the teapot's over there. The brew is stale a bit. Who is it? - Where have you been? - And you? Drinking tea in the kitchen. Oh yeah, how come we didn't run into each other? Guys, where the hell are you? - Bring water! - How'd it start burning? - Canisters of gas are in there. - Why're they there? I can't carry them around with me! It's gonna blow, the car too! - Who told you to go in there? - No one did. - What did you need there? - The car of course. Cough it up! You were going to retrieve the folders, right? No. There were canisters full of gasoline there. Answer, damn it. Were you looking for the papers? Yes, I wrote. Did I not have to? - You're being clever. - I'll do everything you order. - Fetch the nails. - Put it crosswise. Is this a joke? You have a new driver? - Not yet - Why, then? It's ridiculous! 'Cause of a crappy shed! You should interfere! There's no reason I should. It's a spit in the face! The man has disappeared! It's been 3 days already. We don't know where he is! Isn't this reason enough? - Don't get agitated. - I will! I'll go to the admiral! I'll show them hell! - Quiet! - I won't shut up! Hush! Don't get involved in this. General, didn't you... There's a wire for you. They want you in Moscow, urgently. Of course. General, we just... while you're gone They install the wiring. Looking for a break. Go on looking. I intruded and retook him. Too much hysteria around. - Well now, hi. - How do you do, Sir. - You ok? - Yes, sir. I booked a flight to Moscow. - When? - From the airbase, at 4. - Am I going with you? - Stay here. I don't know when I'm coming back. Find a nanny. An experienced one. It's time. - Yes, General. - You're responsible here. Keep an eye out, correct things. - Well, you understand. - I'll correct them. Will you eat, before you leave? Coming. Pay Lida and let her go. Today. - Lida? - She shouldn't stay. I see. You want some chicken? They'll feed him in the plane, with some cognac. Cognac too, ha. Lida, you know... As of today you're transferred back to the garrison. - What? - Back to the garrison. You mean I'm being retired? It's the general's order. I see. Great! - Are you crazy? - Go to hell! - You fool. - Leave me alone. - Farewell, Victor. - What'd you mean? They sacked me. Threw me away. Because of you, by the way. Ain't that just fair? Tell me, is it fair? Am I to blame for men liking me? They sleep out of love and marry for status. Open the door! Vera, calm down. Call the guards to break the door down. - Oh, my God. - The key's inside. - Shall we change the flight? - Open. I need to talk to you. Go away, all of you! I don't need anybody, hear me? Break it down. Go away! Go away. Or I'll burn my face, you know I will. Don't, honey. Don't torture yourself. Come. It's all right, honey. We'll do everything as you say. Just... Put the iron down. What do you want? Tell me. Nothing. What about... ...what about mashed potatoes with butter? The way you loved, as a child. How about it? Yes, with seed-oil. The way mama used to make. Mother... Come, come. Come... Oh, god. He is off. - Now I'll get the sack, like Lida? - Think about it. Why'd he want his daughter to marry an adulterer? If you were a colonel, maybe. Help me. I don't need anyone but Vera. I'm in love with her. Don't give me that bull. Why'd you need this family? After the army, you're a civilian. I need the army! It gave me everything! It showed me bedsheets for the first time. - You're overstating it. - Near our orphanage... ...there was a barrack where workers lived: 2 families in a room: Drinking bouts, a shit-bucket. I grew up in this orphanage. And the workers life seemed a fairytale to us. - So what? - Nothing. I'll eat earth, but I won't go back to that shit! So you need either a wedding, or a plane crash... I'm joking! All right. I'll try to pull the wool over Vera's eyes. Come on. Let's go. That Lida, ha! A clever snake, she is. She made it up, everything! You see, I saw myself how she tried to force her way into his room. He won't let that bitch in. My word of honor. - KGB men summoned you? - And they will again. Too bad. Can you tell me why they're badgering me? Now I can. Americans reminded Khrushchev about that shipwreck, the 'radiation' and all. And he's like, ' no, it can't be'. They gave him the facts. So, he looked shitty. Now he needs blood, you and that KGB guy are the scapegoats. If you don't have a paper of the KGB guy's order... - I have his order. - Why didn't you say so? I didn't want problems with them. Vera, I love you. Honestly. Shall I step off the cliff for you to believe me? Shall I shoot myself? - Did you 2 ever? - Of course not. - She was hanging all over you. - So what? Nothing. Swear you're not lying. Swear on your mother. I swear. On your mother? Yes, on my mother. Kiss me. - Do you really love me? - Yes. Sometimes I think you don't. - Wait! Did I hurt your feelings? - No. - I don't believe we'll get married. - Why? I'm a small person. You won't get married to a sergeant, will you. Come on. My father will come back and see to everything. Let's go. - Where's Savelyev? - He's has a toothache. What? Again? How is Vera? She's all right. We go to theatre. We read soulful books. Remarque's 'Three Comrades'. Her belly is getting really big. There was no belly, then All of the sudden it grew. All right, then. How was your trip, Comrade general? It was ok. I'm was so good, someone's head is gonna fall. I also looked into your future. You'll study in Moscow. Not now, of course. What? The brakes! - The brake pedal dropped! - Change gear! I can't! Get out of the car, quickly! It's falling! - Jump! - The door... - Jump! - The door's jammed. Vera! Don't worry, but they're in big trouble. I don't know the details. I'm going to the scene now. Their car dropped off the cliff. It's absurd, General, but she's either in labour or had some fit. We took her to the hospital. She's only in her 7th month. Can't you stop it? Are you kidding? She's in labour. Sit down. Mother, oh god! The brakes? You mean It could be planned. Who's responsible for this? You wan a court marshal! - Bring oxygen bags. - Two? Oh, dear Mother! Mommy, this is your baby. It's alive. It's a girl! You, motherfuckers! I'll pull your ears over your asses! Release my driver, immediately! He's a suspect in the fact of the accident. I'll take of the 'fact' myself! If you don't release him - I'll personally demote you! Yes sir! A toast for Vera and the baby. It's ok that it was born premature. My baby sister was born premature too and she was cool! She even had rosy cheeks. People wondered: How come? There was famine, the war just ended. Did you love your sister? Well, you know... Mother was a telephone operator, working all day. I changed the diapers, fed her, washed her. In winter, I'd freeze standing in line for baby food. I'd run home, and mother would say: Have a gulp of milk. But I would never touch it, just so that my Sveta would get enough. And? When Mother died of TB, they took us to different orphanages. - Why? - What? Why'd they separate you? I don't know. It was the rules. I tried to run away 2 times. First time they caught me. Second time, It was too late already. She died of dysentery, from lack of care. She was only a year and a half. You should stick to me, Victor. They're trying to get at me. But their ass'll stick, from trying to get at me. They'll be tried for that accident. You'll see how many heads roll. Cheers. Here now, to the baby. For her happiness! Love it, brothers, Ain't life so great. No fear, with our ataman. The first bullet... Atta boy, son! The first bullet aimed at my horse. And the second bullet... And the second bullet wounded me. Ain't she dark. Easy, don't let her go. - Did you miss us? - Of course. I missed you so very much! This month seemed as long as a life. - Come on. - Let's welcome them! Meet Valya. Nurse Valya. Let me... - I'll take the child. - I'll do it myself. Come on. Come on in! Hi! Hi! How are you? - And you? - Well... Are you in a hurry? It's a pity. We could have a chat. - Some other time. - You're lying again. I'm sorry! So sorry! The gullies, 11 Novatorov Str! You Parkinsonic, your hands're shaking? - Take me to the army attorney. - Will do. I'm going there about your business. The general can't help you, you know. However, strange as it may seem, I can. Thank you. And you owe it to me, you're going to Moscow. He said in a month, but I arranged you go on Friday. - This Friday? - Yeah. The old man's became so stubborn and absent-minded. He lost this yellow folder. Did you see it by chance? - No. - Maybe it's in his safe? Maybe. Yes, he positively left it in his safe. I guess someone needs to find it, what do you say? - Who? - You and me. See, but the key... Find out where he keeps the key. What if I'm caught? Let him look for his folder himself. No. We need to help him. See now, Sveta, we're in a mess. What'd we do now, Sveta? Why aren't you sleeping? I'll manage myself. Go to bed. I'll be waiting for you. Come when she falls asleep. - All right. - Here. Go, lay down. - There's another room. - Close the windows. Hey, kid, get up. Disinfecting crew. What? - What the hell is this? - Ha? - This is a nursery! - We're not just on vacation here. Hey, we told you: Disinfecting crew. - What the hell do you mean? - Easy, easy. Cool it! Cool it, I said! Who? - Who ordered this? - The region's being disinfected. It's this bug. We wanted to do this before the birth... - No, we're ok. - Sanitary inspection insist. - Not with the child. - We'll send the baby & Vera away. I've seen to everything. It'll only take 24 hours. You and me are also leaving. It's his last day here! I'm not going anywhere. You'll be taken to an apartment in town, and then straight to Moscow. You're a lucky. Moscow! I really envy you. - I'm staying here. - But... It's an order! I want you to have one to remember me by. I'm a toddler here. My leg was still healthy. I was born healthy, you know. This is me and my Mom. After it happened. I must pack my stuff. Yes, just... I'll give you this one, for you to remember me. Please, don't leave! - I'll die without you. - Don't, please. - Go, go on. - Just a sec. - You needn't... - Let me pack my stuff. ...breath these chemicals. I just wanted... All right. I've dismissed them till morning. What are you pottering about? Faster, army-style. Off to study! Come on. I don't know, really. It's the wrong moment for me to leave. Vera's nervous, the baby is too. I see! - Can't I leave in 2 days? - No! Come on. No! I can't leave today. I'm not going. I'm sick of you. No one'll look for you? The general will. You think so? Well, I have some good news. Your general is history! He doesn't know yet, but there's an order. In 3 day's he'll be in the garbage, like a torn condom. Got it!? You probing me, ha? Me? You? Why? We're friends, aren't we. If of course, you didn't fall in love with that Vera... Are you really in love with that weirdo? - No, I'm not. - Great for you. Atta boy! Don't ask for trouble. A word - and you're tried for 'attempted murder'! Got it? Look after the bathhouse. What should I do then? Run. Pack up and move to Moscow. Now, while you have a chance. Before you're deported up north to slice ice with your arse! Dad! See you tomorrow! Crazy! What's there to spray at night. Probably they're mad they didn't do it earlier. - Zina! Where's the baby food? - In the trunk, I guess. Are you sure? Careful. - Stupid me! I forgot! - What? - I forgot to pack the photo. - It's a pity. It's too bad. It's an evil omen. All right. Sit tight. - What about the train? - We'll make it. The basket was in the kitchen. I thought you'd take it. - Why not you? - Hush. Give me the child. - You don't know how with a child. - Me? Yes, you. The gates are locked. Drive to the back one then. Vera, hurry up, all right? Just a sec. The basket. - It's here. - Where? - Damn, I won't make it. - Who put it together? You're the nurse, it's your duty. Dad! Oh my God! - What've you done, bastard? - What? - You, sonofabitch! - Who let her in? - Who let her in? - Shut up! No hysterics! Shoot him. There's no alternative now. Oh my God! - Get away. Both of you! - Seemed there was a shot. There was. Oh... oh no! Vera... killed her father, herself and the child. The child? Vera's a schizo. You know. Come on. Get out of here. And tell Victor to move it! Yes, run! And mum's the word! Stop, you creep! What a fucking idiot! - He's a goner now. - We'll catch him all right. Sveta dear, don't cry. I understand. Hush, hush! We'll make it! Stop the car! Sveta, don't cry. Search the shore in both directions. No ceremonies. A hole in his head. Period. I can understand you killin' him. But why the baby? You're too late with advice, smart-ass! 3 of you that way, 2 - over there. Sveta, don't cry. What is that? Captain? Why're you silent? Zero! What? No one here! Fuck'n life. Yeah, a dog's life! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back!
