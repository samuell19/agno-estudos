Robe, not so much. Robe! I'm carsick. Of course you're carsick. You're playing on your iPad. What are you listening to? Nothing. Music. Plug it in so we can all listen to it. No! Plug it in!! I hate soccer. OK. But don't sing. I promise. Dad... Don't sing! Daddy... Don't sing! Daddy! Don't sing! You know I hate when you sing. Are you all right? Yes. Shall we pull over? You've reached Dr. Bruegel's dental office... Please leave your message after the beep. ALL THAT IS INVISIBLE The exact time is 1:15 PM. Yes? Hey, good morning. What's up, Morris? I'm almost at the institute... for my neverending monthly meeting. Did you just wake up? A while ago. I didn't get any sleep. Again? Yeah, I stayed up reading an amazing book you have to read. It's good you still have a sense of humor. Even if only theoretical. What do you mean “theoretical”? Forget it, it was a joke. But I'm not taking back what I said about the book. You'd love it. Maybe we can find it in... No, Morris... I'm not in the mood for a book about the Italian mafia. It's not about the mafia, but it doesn't matter. My aunties are coming at 2:00 to go with you to pick up the girls. No! There's no need. It's good for them to walk. Besides, they want to go. Tell them thanks, but no. All right... I'll call you later. Kisses. Hi, good afternoon. Hello. Hi, girls! Hi, Dad. Hey, thanks! See you. How did it go? Fine. That's good. Can we go to the swings? No. Not now. Why do we never go anymore? Swings or nothing. Hey, Julia. We'll be back later with Mom. Let's go. Make your choice. Swings or nothing. You'll be leading us home, Robe. OK? OK. Robe? Don't let go of my hand. They're here. Call Amanda. Come on, Juli. Open your mouth... Mr. Bruegel, thank you for holding. As my colleague was saying, rulings are sent via certified mail... in approximately 90 working days. How many working days are there in six months? Surely more than ninety, right? That's right, but there are exceptions. You have to wait for the ruling to be delivered at your home. I need information. I want to know how the case is coming along. At the very least, what the result of the surveyor's inspection was. If you don't put me through to someone who can give me information. I'm going to your office and I won't move until I can talk to someone. You have no idea how far I'm willing to go. Don't test me. How come you never cover up? Julia, it's time to go to sleep. Dad, what did you dream? We'll talk about all this tomorrow. Dad, how come you never wear jackets? We'll talk about it at breakfast. Shut up! I want to sleep! It's time to go to sleep. You shut up! Hey, hey, hey. Julia. Turn it off! Morris? Hi. Did I wake you? I was awake. Everything ok? The doctor's office called... What was his name again? Sotelo Rocha. Yes, him. I'm not seeing him anymore. In that case, we should find someone else. The claims department manager from the car company will see us Friday at 10:00. Did they call you? No. I called them. For the tenth time. Well, that's good. Finally. You're freezing! You taste like yoghurt. Morris... Are you mad because I said you taste like yoghurt? It's fine. Good night. Are you going to sleep without brushing your teeth first? No. Would you spell out your last name, please? B-R-U-E-G-E-L. I have the ruling here. It should've arrived at your house by mail. It says that... the company agrees to take partial responsibility with the client.. And grants full coverage for medical expenses. It's pretty good. What do you mean good? The accident was due to a manufacturing error. You have to take responsibility for much more than the medical expenses. And you know that. Yes, I understand. The issue is that it hasn't been proven that the airbag deployed late. Our experts suggest it might be a matter of perception. I am proof that it deployed late! My advice is to take this settlement. Practically no lawsuits involving air bags get any pay off. Our lawyers are very aggressive... and the second verdict is hardly ever favorable for the client. We'll have to think about it. No we won't. We're going to find a fucking tougher lawyer than yours. Please talk to her. Your support is important so she can understand the consequences of such behavior. What can I do from the institute so that you stay put? Send you paralyzing rays? You have reached Saul Algazi and associates lawyer's office. If you'd like us to reach you on the number you're dialing from... please press zero. The exact time is 9:49 AM. Hello? Son, how are you doing? How are Amanda and the girls? Fine. Thanks, dad. How's Flor? Crazy, you know. She's acting in a new soap opera... filming non-stop. Did you read the article I sent you... about the insertion of digital chips that communicate with the brain? Interesting technology. No, Dad. I'm not reading much lately. There are apps for that. Your iPhone can read to you. Do you have an iPhone? Yeah, but I don't know where it is. You need to ease back into your routine... find out what's going on in the world. Dad, I'd love to hear your tips... but there's someone at the door. We'll talk later, all right? Well, ok. I send you a hug. I'll call you when I come back. Yes, send him up. Thank you. What's up, Saul? It's been years, man. Yes. Thank you for coming. I was just making some coffee. Would you like some? I'd rather have some tea. Thanks. How old are your daughters? Roberta is six and Julia is five. Roberta, like your mother. Yes, she hates the name. Your practice is at your mother's place, isn't it? That was the number I dialed. Yeah, I kept the same number. You know she passed away four years ago? No, we hadn't heard. It was very sudden. A heart attack. I'm very sorry. Yeah... So, I came here because... I didn't want to say this over the phone. It's not that I'm still mad or anything like that... but after all that happened... I'm not sure it's such a good idea for me to take your case. The truth is that maybe... Dude... What? Jonas! What happened? What do you mean “what happened”? You almost burned down the kitchen. Are you high or something? That's rough, man. I had no idea. You really can't see anything? Lights. But we still haven't explored all our options. It's still healing. It's this one right in front. The dent is in the back. Are you ok? Yeah. The person who crashed into you, what was their statement? He never showed. It was this guy that got real frightened. Roberta and Julia gave statements. Amanda says it was a disaster. They cried the whole time and gave contradictory versions. Do you think the accident was caught on a security camera somewhere? I just turned on Copernico and we're now approaching Michelet. We crashed just before crossing the street... and we pulled over right in front of the medical tower. The second buiding after the intersection. I'll go ask. Do they have security cameras? Yes, but they're new. They tore down the building. And had new cameras installed less than three months ago. We need to see if there are more cameras around here. I'll send someone from my office to check. Thank you. How's Amanda? Great, really great. Doing a million things. She's finishing her post-doc and teaching. Does she know we're meeting? Of course. It was her idea. Any distinctive features? He's bald, with a thick beard... And he's blind. He is bald, he has a beard and he's blind. OK. He's here. He's here, officer! Thank you! The missing person has turned up. What happened? Let's talk in the bedroom. Can I get you anything? We're fine. Oh, I made some yummy jell-o. Where were you? Running errands. Were those cops? Did you let some cops in the house because I went out for two hours? You didn't tell me where you were going and you didn't take your cell phone. You don't tell me where you go either, whenever you go out. What? I'll let my aunties out. Are you done with your homework? Did you know cereal is not real food? Says who? The dietician. We can't use the stove. Eat this for now, we'll order some pizza later with Mom. She also says pizza isn't food. Why can't we use the stove? Because... because we're out of gas. No, we're not. Wanna see? No! I said no, Roberta! Come here! Don't call me Roberta! Cereal is what we have, and that's what we're going to eat. You love cereal. No! No. And we don't like it. Girls, come here! Robe, Julia... Don't even think about going out on the balcony. Robe, Julia... what are you doing!? Robe, Julia... Girls, open up! You can't lock yourselves in there. I'm serious! I'm going to count to five. One... Two... Three... Four... Step back! Are they asleep? Yes. But Julia didn't even say good night. It wasn't the way you think. I did it to protect them. Robe told me they were playing and you suddenly kicked the door down. I know we've talked about this a million times, but you should consider... I'm not going to therapy, Morris. I don't believe in it. So, then? They turned off all the lights and I had one of those visions... I saw these twins roughly Roberta's age that kept following me around. First, they appeared at the end of the hallway. Then, they were next to me. I know they're not there, but they're there. What's so funny? It's just like The Shining. Yes. And it's not funny. Your mom had a twin that died as a kid, right? Yes. I read an article about those hallucinations. There are things the neurologist didn't tell us. Oh. All right, enlighten me. No, better not. Are you hungry? Come on. Tell me, Morris. I'm interested. It's a study made by these English researchers. Shall I read it to you? Yes. Please. The human eye sends information to the brain at a speed of approximately 8.75 megabits per second. When a person goes blind and the link fails... the visual cortex fills the void with images stored in the memory. Thus, it creates extremely realistic visions... that can cause trouble in the patients' daily life. Do you know who's coming up? No. Who? Saul Algazi. Really? Do you tell him to come? No... But he's helping me with the compensation deal. Really? You couldn't find another lawyer? Do you know what he does for a living? He beats trans-national companies in court. Besides, he and I have known each other since we were ten. Here, get dressed. Yes, and it's been ten years since we last saw him. For good reasons. You open the door. What's up? Dude... I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but... do you know what I have here? No. What? It's a back-up from the security cameras from the medical offices. How did you manage to get it? We've been tracking the back-up for those cameras for days. We were told the hard drives were in a storage facility, and that the footage from the date of the accident might be there. I sent a kid to make sure and there it was. I don't know how it happened but we scored a goal from the midfield line! That's great! Hello. Hey. It's been years. December 15th should be in here. Here it is! It happened between 8:00 and 8:10 AM. I was dropping off the girls at school. Let's see. What? We found the footage. You're going to be a millionaire, man. We have to do some more research, but I think we can get... a million dollars per eye. Really? No fucking way. Did you hear that, Morris? Yes, it's a lot of money. So? Shall we go for a drink to celebrate we're going to beat those bastards? Right now? Come on, let's go. It's been years since we've gone out. What about the girls? The Medusas sleep during the day. And we have more TV channels here. Stop. Don't call my aunties that. Excuse us... Thanks! I wanted us to get a drink... It's for the three of us. Because finding that footage, which was nearly impossible... is a sign that we should leave all that shit behind. The truth is I was taken aback when you called me. But seeing what a hard time you're going through... I want you to know I'm going to help you take this as far as I can. Thank you so much, man. None for me, thanks. Champagne doesn't work for me, it goes straight to my head. This moment calls for it! One glass, Morris. Let's toast to justice being made. To justice, goddammit! Cheers. Yeah! Good evening. What? You're never in the mood. There've been times when you weren't in the mood. When the girls were born, I wasn't up for it, but I wanted other things. You don't want anything. Are you all right? Careful, there's a step. That's it. Wait for me here. Jonas. Saul. Hey. Hello. There's something I need to give you. Give me your hand. What's this? It's a cane. No, thank you. What do you mean “no, thank you”? You have to use it in front of these guys. I talked to an expert, he said there will be psychologists taking notes. Let's go. We're seeing pictures of the steering wheel with the airbag deployed. There's blood on it. Now the car without the steering wheel. Now the steering wheel with the inside part removed. And now pictures of the inside part. They're analyzing it. That's it. We're going to stop here, counselor... because this picture clearly shows how we found insulating tape around the cables that connect the horn to the vehicle's electrical system. Which means that the seal on the steering wheel was broken at an unauthorized repair center. Therefore, our company is released from any liability concerning the airbag deployment. No, no. That's not my car's steering wheel. I never took it to any non-authorized repair shop. The whole process was documented. We can prove this is your car's steering wheel. Did you take it to another shop? We'll talk about this outside. Counselor. Counselor. I trust you'll send me copies of all the documentation. Of course. What's the name of the company that did the analysis? The company that did the analysis is one of our subsidiaries... Exactly, that's the problem. Conflict of interest. The worst part is that all this time, since the accident... you knew they had fucked the steering wheel and didn't say anything. They didn't fuck the steering wheel, they fixed the car horn. Why didn't you wait until you got back from Tepoz to take it to the dealership? I don't know. I was scared it might go off in the highway, with the girls in the car. It took them less than ten minutes to get it fixed. Right. And what a brilliant job they did. I just don't understand why you didn't say anything. Because I forgot until now! OK? I never thought those two things might be related. Well, now you know. A little late, no? We're in front of the house. Are you going to park here? No. I was thinking about having dinner with my sister. Oh! Ok. I can get upstairs by myself. Ok. Hello? Sol... Can I drop by for a little while? We're about to step into the movies. Did something happen? No, I'll call you tomorrow. Are you sure? Yes. Bye. Bye. Amanda? Amanda went to see Sol. You should go to bed. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thanks, son. Oh, my God! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Don't worry. Are you all right? Yeah, I was just sending some texts. I came because something happened after the meeting that I couldn't tell you over the phone. Careful. Get in. It turns out there's a not-so-kosher way of getting the money. Does not-so-kosher mean illegal? That concept doesn't apply in this country. But our laws can be interpreted from different perspectives. Don't give me that, I'm not as narrow as you think. Nor am I as crooked as you think. But this is the last chance we have of getting something. They propose creating a new file under a different serial number, one without a canceled warranty. That way, we'd get an insurance payoff from a third-party damage scheme. But we need to let them know today if we're in or not. Is Jonas upstairs in the apartment? Yes. But he didn't take it well. He blamed me for everything. No. The defect in the air bag system has nothing to do with the electrical system from the car horn. The bags are deployed through a chemical reaction. The Tepoz repair shop was purely bad luck... But that's life. That's why we have to get the money no matter what. Thank you for helping us. The truth is, I was scared when you showed up with the video. I thought things would be more difficult. No. It was good for me to see you two. Want one? Ok. It's better to face things head on. Besides, he and I know each other since we were children. And I'm the messy-haired ex-girlfriend you should've skipped altogether. No. Not at all. Remember the Montenegro mural in the living room? Sure, the one with the busty flower sellers? Well, I found out there was no way to get it out because it's protected by INAH. I couldn't either sell or rent the house, so I moved there, together with my practice. Yeah, I've actually seen the sign. The institute where I teach is right around the corner. What I didn't know was that your mother passed away. I'm really sorry. It was very sudden. I was going to tell Jonas, but then... The number you've dialed is not available... What was that? I don't know. I think the doors lock automatically. I remember your mom clearly. When she met you, she told me to marry you. Really? Again? Morris? Yes. What are you doing here? Sol wasn't home. Hey... I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I... Jonas. Who are you? I'm Saul, man. Relax. “Relax”!? What the hell were you doing, Amanda? Why were you sitting there, smoking? You don't even smoke anymore. He came here to tell us that there's another way to get the money. But we have to make up our minds today. But why behind my back? It wasn't behind your back. Why didn't you say he was there? I already explained! I already explained! What are you doing? You think that, just because I'm blind, you can lie right to my face? I'm not an idiot. You're the one who asked Saul for help. Your jealousy makes no sense. I'm not jealous. I need to be able to trust you. I'm sure you can imagine why. Can I get a taxi? 55-89-04-11. You can't leave. What can I do, according to you? Life is a gift from God which we're meant to enjoy. Don't you think? I'm blessed with the certainty that Christ is inside me. You're a man of faith. I can tell. If you currently feel that the road is blurry, open your heart to the Lord and you'll see. This one has also been declined, sir. Do you have any other payment method? No. I have an inflatable mattress at home, if you have nowhere else to spend the night... No, no. Thanks. Hey, hey... be careful! How much is it? No, no. Put that away. It was a blessing for me to drive you here, trust me. One day you'll know why. Good night. Blessings. Dad. Hi, son. Give me that. I got it, it's fine. No, I don't want any, Dad. Thanks. Eat. I bought the bread during my layover in Munich. And I got this sake from the Osaka municipality... to thank me for detecting a forest fire during our landing. Amanda called, she's worried. This is not a time to be foolish. You should hold on. I need to go to the bank to pick up a card and I'll stay at a hotel. Can I spend the night here? Mhm... Are you sure you want to stay upstairs? It's full of stuff. The guest room is perfect. Upstairs. Upstairs is fine, Dad. I got it, I got it. I'm almost leaving for the airport. Where are you flying? Beijing. I'll be back Friday morning. But Flor will be here if you need anything. Ok. We'll talk soon. You need a shave. You can't walk around like that. Makes a poor impression. Yes, Dad. Sweeties, wake up. Up, up, Robe. The bus will pick you up in 20 minutes. Help me, get dressed. Come on, Juli. The aunties will pick you up today. You'll stay with them until tomorrow afternoon. I have to go to a conference in Colima. No! I don't want to sleep in the doll room. It scares me. It's just for one night. The Medusas' cooking sucks. Don't call them that. I've told you already. Why isn't Dad picking us up? Because he's not here. He left... to get a special treatment. For his eyes? Yes. When is he coming back? I don't know. One of these days. We'll see. We'll see what? We'll see what happens, okay? Well, I'll get your lunch ready. Hurry up, or you'll miss your bus. Hi. Amanda? Yes. Can I get a taxi? 56-58-77-35 Yes, thanks. How long? There are 42 drivers in the taxi lot. But we're not always in the neighborhood. That's why, when I heard Capulines 18... I immediately knew it was God's will for us to hear each other again. Let me take this. Come. Thanks. It's my account. I know the PIN numbers. We need an ID, sir. Please, I need to withdraw money, I'll tip you. Sorry, sir, we can't do that. Is everything all right? Pity, take pity please. He's with me. Excuse me, thank you. You're very kind. Very kind. Thank you! Good afternoon. Hi, Juanita. Good afternoon, ma'am. Here he is. Thanks. Blessings for you, my friend. Blessings, blessings. Blessings for you as well, ma'am. Hello? Hi, Amanda. It's Saul. How are you? What happened in the end? Not so great. Jonas was furious. He spent the night at his father's. Really? That's too bad. I'm sorry. Yes, I know. Things are getting rough. Were you able to tell him about the deal? No. I couldn't even explain. Can I give you his dad's home number so you can ask him directly? It's embarrassing, but... Yes, of course. I understand. By the way... since you work so close to my house, why don't you drop by sometime... and we can talk over lunch? Hi, love. FloFlo. How are things? Good. Coming home from the shoot. Listen, I heard your voice mail and I think you're over reacting. We agree, right? I can't ask them to adjust my flight schedule to my wife's ovulation periods. That's not what I want. But this is the fourth time in a row you've been away. Ouch! Vic, I'll call you back. Hold on. Hello. Was I playing too loud? I don't even know what time it is. I'm sorry. No, you're fine. It's still early. I'm not staying here forever. I need to get a new card from the bank, and then I'll go to a hotel. Don't even worry about me. I cut myself with a broken kettle, and I haven't stopped bleeding. You saw my pain threshold when you fixed my tooth and had to use... so much anesthetic, I thought I'd had a stroke. All right, wait here. I'll go get it. I found it. I had no idea. Get some gauze and peroxide. You know what? I'll get an Uber to have this checked out. To a hospital? I suck at emergencies. This is not an emergency. Are there any gloves? Give me your hand. Where is it? Right here. Don't move. Wait, wait, wait! I think I'm calling that Uber... There. It's out in one piece. Thank you so much! Ready! Hello? Yes. Yes, one moment. It's for you. Saul. Hello? Dude... Before you say anything... Amanda and I being alone in the car... was a total coincidence. Give me a break. Regardless of whether you believe me or not... we have to decide about the proposal they made after the meeting. Did Amanda explain? What part? Because, apparently you didn't want me to know everything. Perhaps you have some resentment, and I'm sure it's justified... but I don't think this is the right time to get your revenge. Revenge? On the contrary, you prick. I'm trying to get you that money. All you have to do is sign some papers. I'm at a Japanese restaurant with some clients. They'll be totally wasted in an hour. Come, we'll have a drink and you can sign this shit. How am I supposed to get there? I can't leave, or this deal might fall through. I could send you an escort. What? You're out of your mind. I want you to get the money. The air bag was defective. That money is yours. Let me see what I can do. Where are we going? To Montes Urales street. Do you know the way? Of course not, my cell phone will guide me. I have an incapacitated sense of direction, and I hate to ask for directions. I hate it, too. Especially in this country, where the more they explain, the worse you get lost. It could be the battery. Yes. Believe it or not, your dad takes his car keys with him when he flies. But we can take the motorcycle. I'm not getting on the motorcycle. I'm an excellent driver. No! Forget it. Really! Cheers! Campai! One more! I'll be right back. Jonas! Hey! I'm so glad you came, man Yeah. This is Flor, my dad's wife. Saul Algazi, nice to meet you. How do you do? Your stepmother is hot. She's not my stepmother, and she'll hear you, man. She already did. Let me explain. We have to switch the files before their offices open tomorrow at nine. I need you to sign all these papers. Give me your hand. Here, on each page. Please. This is the original file. We need to keep it. They don't want it in their offices. Perfect. Do you want one? No! We got here on the motorcycle. Wow, that's cool. What kind of motorcycle do you ride? It's Victor's. I don't have one here. But I used to have a silver Vespa when I lived in Rome. Selling it was one of the saddest moments of my life. I believe you. I have a BMW 1200, and I'm about to get myself a classic from '82. With double olives. Yes. Capulines 18. Thank you ma'am. Wanna keep me company while I smoke outside? Until the pizza arrives. Ok. Would you like some? No. I haven't smoked pot since I used to sneak out to this garden to do it. What a better place to do it again? It'll help you relax. I am relaxed. One puff. All right... It's good, isn't it? Yeah. I heard you on the keyboard. How come you're so good? I'm not that good. When I was twenty, I had a band I was very serious about. We even played gigs. But Captain Bruegel put a lot of pressure on me to pursue a serious career You know I only gave you a provisional implant, right? You never came back to have it replaced. I know. I had to go to Colombia for work, so I had it fixed there. We had a good time that night, didn't we? We even ate molletes. It wasn't easy to talk you into going out to eat, huh? I was missing a tooth. No one was going to see you. It was three in the morning. Your look is more “rocker” than it was back then. That is a nice way of putting it. Do you remember my face? Did you also think about me after that night I came to your practice? I'm not going to answer that question. That means yes? It means I don't think we should have this conversation. But we're having it. Did you think about me? I thought it was weird you never came back to have the implant replaced. Do you want to know why I didn't come back? For the same reason you didn't say hello to me this morning? It's the pizza. Where are you going? I asked for a cab. I'm going to my practice. It's not that I don't want to... But we know what the situation is. And for me, there couldn't be a worse time than this. On the contrary, don't you think? It's during the tough moments that we should do whatever the hell we want. The only thing I need now is for the blessing taxi driver to pick me up. Who? Take care. Good night. Where to? I don't have any more on me. I'll give you 500 if you walk me up to my medical practice. Come on. Look, sir... Don't take this the wrong way but... But I'm a family man. I don't want someone to get the wrong idea. I'll go get your money. Could you turn on the light? The switch is right there by the door. It seems the power's out. All right, leave it. Don't worry. Give me the 200. Of course not. You came with me for the money, not for pity. Here you go. All right, then. Thank you. Good night. When you wake up Time has gone by And you find out The path has been drawn Who is still with you Who has already left Who takes your hand Who has vanished Who wants to see the moon From the same balcony A kiss Cures the pain Hugs the soul In order to walk And it's that calm that lets you decipher Who takes your hand And who has vanished Who wants to see the moon From the same balcony Hello? Hello? Yes? Hello? Yes? Hi Flor. How are you? It's Amanda. Fine, and you? Fine. Thank you. Hey, is Jonas there? Uh... No. He's not. He left. What do you mean he left? Where did he go? He said he was going to his practice. I think he needed to pick something up. Ok. I'll look for him there. If he calls, please tell him to call me. Sure. Bye. Bye. We're changing the destination. Good afternoon. Jonas! Jonas, it's me! I just want to make sure you're all right. Please, open up! Why are you screaming in the hallway? Everyone can hear you. Come in. I'm sorry I didn't tell you Saul was in the car. I didn't mean to. No? What did you mean, then? I don't know. At the time, I didn't remember that you couldn't see him. Oh, of course not. Not everything is about what happened to you. Sometimes I forget. And it's good that I forget, it would be wrong if... What? If you could put yourself in my situation? I always put myself in your situation. Who is it? The Benitez. Should I open? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Come on in. We heard about what happened and we're very sorry. We know you have a ton of equipment. And if you're interested, we'd like to buy your zirconium printer. Thank you for the offer, but no. Why don't we think about it and get back to them later? I'm not selling my zirconium printer to these guys, they're terrible dentists. What if they're not good? They want the printer. Let's hear their offer. Oh, Amanda! Gentlemen, we already talked about this and we're not interested. I'll walk you out. If you change your minds... I won't be changing my mind. Thank you. Let's go. Morris... You should leave. I'm staying here. I need you to send me my passport so I can replace my credit cards. Are you out of your mind? This place doesn't even have a bathroom. We'll talk about this at home. I don't know if I want to talk about it. Wait... The thing about the Tepoz repair shop was a mistake... and so was the way I handled that business with Saul. But we have to focus on what's important. Easy for you to say. Easy? My life has also changed radically since last year. It hasn't been easy for me either. And that's why you want to sell my printer? So your life can go back to how it was like last year? Is that what you think of me? I don't know... Please, leave. We'll talk later. Yupi, Yupi... come here! Yupi... get the ball! Girls! Dinner! Hello? Amanda, it's Saul. I'm sorry to wake you, but we have a huge problem. Where can I find Jonas? So, we'll see you Monday. And bring samples for the resins. I get it. I'm on my way to see my client to get back the original file. What I don't understand is why you didn't know about the audit. I just got here. I'll call you as soon as I get it. Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Who is it? Don't move, come. What are you doing here, you prick? Come. Go away. Move over here. Seriously, it's dangerous, ok? The idiots from the car company who offered us the deal... just found out there's an audit taking place first thing tomorrow. They can't switch the file. They need to recover the original. Did you keep it? What original? The original file I gave you at the restaurant. I don't know. I have no idea. Maybe Flor kept it. Let's go get it. We're not waking her up for this. We can get in some serious trouble over this. I don't care what happens. It's all the same to me. Well, not to me. Let's go. You can't make me go. I'm trying to help you, asshole. I don't want your help. And don't call me asshole. It's your fault we're in this mess. Figure it out yourself, if you're such a hot shot. What's wrong with you? You broke my nose, dude! Sorry, man. Come on, I'm sorry. Are you all right? You know what I don't understand? Why are you so mad at me and not the other way around? Amanda was my girlfriend when you met her. We gave up everything to be together. We got married and had two daughters. You would've broken up with her in less than 6 months, no after thoughts. But since she fell in love with me, your friend, the bald nerd... that didn't sit right with you. And you decided to freeze me out despite being friends since we were ten. You're so competitive! No, you're the one who's competitive, man. You can't trust me, even after I put myself on the line to help you. It's a terrible thing what happened to you, brother. I'm really sorry, I want to help you. Let's go find that file. We were there Wednesday night. The group that was sitting close to the door. I don't know, three o'clock? Let me find the voucher and I'll tell you exactly what time we left. I'm going to the car to get my wallet. Sure Couldn't it be around here somewhere? Not in my bag. Then I came here to order the pizza. And I asked you if you wanted to smoke with me. Shall we check there? Yes. It's not here. No? No. Did you find it? No. Damn it. It's hard to believe. Why set this in motion when all the trouble was gonna come from the inside? I'm going to tell them we don't have it. We'll see what solution they come up with. They are a bunch of idiots. What about you, bro? You can't go back to your office... Do you want to stay at my place? You could also stay here. Are you sure you don't mind? Of course not. I can get upstairs on my own. I know. But I like walking like this. We're here. Well. Good night. Sleep tight. Flor? I was thinking about what you said yesterday. What, exactly? That there are times when we have to do whatever the hell we want. I don't think we'll find a condom in the Second World War first aid kit. Do you have any? No need. I'm on the pill. Are you sure? Yes. I was so close to missing out on this. Yeah, I know. I had to insist. No. I was about to jump from a tenth floor... but for some reason, I didn't do it. Don't ever do that. I won't. FloFlo. Vic. Come with me. Look. What is this? It's to keep an eye on Dad when he's alone with us. Look, look. There's Mom. Yeah, that's true. What is she up to? Hello? Amanda. Yes, dear. Everything's fine. Your mom would like to talk to you. Put it on speaker. My sweethearts, how are you? Fine, Mom. Where are you? I'm in... Colima. I'll be going straight to the institute. The aunties will pick you up. Be good. Sure. Have a good day. Have a good trip. Thanks. Don't you think this is a radical decision? We could think about it. Do you want a baby? I'm not good at raising children, FloFlo. It's proven. See? It's all a joke to you. I have to go. Vic! A messenger dropped off an envelope for Jonas... but I was heading out so I put it in your motorcycle's trunk. Was it open? Yes. That's strange. Here it is. Jonas? I found the file. Really? Where? It was in the motorcycle's trunk. It slipped my mind. Should I drop it off with Saul? Yes. Thank you. His office is two blocks from Insurgentes avenue, right on... I have the address. He gave me his business card when we said goodbye at the restaurant. Really? I can't believe that guy. Did you bring a suitcase downstairs? Are you leaving? Yeah, I'm staying at a friend's house for a couple of days. That suitcase sounded way too heavy for a couple of days. I guess we'll see what happens. Well... Good bye. Good bye. Bye. Cuties! It's us! Good afternoon. Good afternoon, teacher. How's everything? Hello. Amanda, it's Cata. The meeting was pushed until four, so we're getting lunch at the Yucatecan place. Do you want to meet us there? Thanks, I already ate. So we'll see you at four. Yes. I'll see you at the meeting. All right, bye. Bye. It's great you found it, we were in big trouble. But ideally you guys would still get the money, right? No. We dodged being accused of fraud. But the money won't be coming our way. Hi, Juanita. Hi, Don Victor. Hello? Don Victor!? Mrs. Amanda's aunt is on the phone! She says it's urgent! Victor? Yes? Amanda isn't picking up. We picked up the girls at the bus stop, we stopped to get some bread... And they just went into the supermarket! But we can't find them! What do you mean you can't find them? What do we do? First of all, calm down. What supermarket are you at? The one around the corner from the house. Socorro?! Go find security and the manager of the store. Ines?! Ask them to close the doors... Dad?! Dad?! What do you mean they can't find the girls? Calm down. I'll go find them. You stay here and wait for my call. You've gotta be crazy I'm coming with you. It's going to be more trouble if you come. It's better if you wait. No, Dad. It's not going to be more trouble. They're my daughters. I'm not staying here. Where are we? In front of the parking lot. Officer, officer. I'm the girls' grandfather. Can we go in? Let them through. Oh, they're here! Are you the manager? Yes, sir. Can we please see the videos? Of course. Oh, thank you, Mr. Saavedra. Saravia, Socorro. Saravia, I'm sorry. Good afternoon. This is Captain Victor Bruegel speaking. My granddaughters are lost in the supermarket. We need everyone to be quiet for a moment so that we can find them. They're two girls aged... Five and six. Five and six years old. Socorro? Yes, son? Where were you when they got lost? We were right outside, getting some bread. But you saw them going in, didn't you? No. A boy told us he saw them go in. We have to look for them outside. They went somewhere else. I'm coming. You know what? I'll go with you. Yes, please. Over here. At the corner. There are two girls on the swings. Julia!? Roberta!? Careful here. Come here immediately! What are you doing here? Why did you wander away? You might have been snatched! I'm sorry. Yes, Dad. My little ones! Let's go find Grandpa. Come on. We can have lunch at the Polish place on New York street. No. I think we're going to wait here for Amanda. Thank you anyway. Good. Then I'll have time to run some errands. Dad... do you have ten minutes? Hey, Dad... When Mom died, you weren't at the funeral, were you? I was in Frankfurt. There was a storm and all air traffic was grounded. I think there was a train that could've taken me to a different airport. But I chose to wait. Why? You were with your grandparents and I was a mess. I thought it was for the better. It wasn't. I'll say goodbye to the girls. Yes, Dad. Thanks. You're welcome. When are you going on my plane? Mom won't let us. She says it's dangerous. In that case I'll take you without her permission. She won't let us. Oh! No. I want mashed potatoes! Well, here it is! Are you leaving for work? No. Are you hungry? Yes! What treatment? Mom said you went to get treatment. Did it work? No... Well, maybe a little. Can you see me? No, but I can hear you. I can also hear bubbles. Who was in charge of keeping an eye on the water? My sister. It's boiling! Let's put the pasta in. Am I close? Yes! There you go. What about the sauce? Do you know where it is? Let's go get the flashlight. Turn the light off. How are you? Why did you run away? We didn't run away, we went to the swings. How are you, my darlings? Fine. Morris? My aunts called me to say the girls “beat them”. What happened? Robe and Julia were at the swings, and your aunts thought they'd gone into the supermarket. They closed all the exits and my dad took over the speakers. It was a whole thing. It must've been scary. Yes. I already scolded them about wandering away. Did they eat? We made some pasta. Would you like some? Morris! Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Is there any pasta left?
