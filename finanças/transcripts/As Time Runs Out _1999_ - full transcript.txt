(upbeat music) (girl screaming) Hey, Marcus, look at this. Hey, you wanna take this guy home? He'd look pretty cool in your bathtub. Really, can I dad? I was kidding. See, he's a sea otter he's not a bathtub otter, but if I ever run across a bathtub otter I'll bring him home. I promise. Let's go check out the whales, huh? Look how round her tummy is, I think she's gonna have a baby bracing. And then will the mommy die? No, I mean, no not all mommies die. (water splashing) [Aquarium moderator] (indistinct) be coming back around to do another fantastic jump you gonna get wet this time. Dan Carlin, oh, this is not a good time Hank. What? Where? Yeah, okay. Okay, yes I'll be right there, I'm on my way. Damn it, I'm not mad at you, Marcus. I, I'm afraid we're gonna, we're gonna have to cut our day short. I got a problem that work, I'm really sorry. Flippo bars. [Aquarium moderator] That concludes the show for today folks, check your schedule- Can I have one dad? Sure, sure. How about getting one next time? (sad music) I'm gonna call Roberta. Have her go to the market and get you a whole mess of those, those ice cream things. What are they called? Flippo bars. They don't have them at the market. Well then I'll have her get you something else, whatever you want. It's okay, dad. Hey Marcus, why'd you leave me in the car, you afraid I'll get eaten by the octopus? That's not how Bosco talks. But close. Raised in its own juices. Sounds too healthy. I'll make it the way I know with the butter and sour cream. Mr. Carlin's home early. You're back so soon. Oh yeah. I got a call. One of our freighters fully loaded is taking on water right here in the port. Which translates into english as don't hold dinner. Yeah. Listen, I know I really disappointed him, can you help me make it up to him? Is there some particular toy he's been wanting. He's got enough toys to start a mail order business. Yeah, yeah, well. I don't know something else then. I'll think of something. Thanks. Bye. Hey Marcus, what's up? My dad was supposed to spend the whole day with me. Wait he bailed on you again? Okay, why don't you hang with me and help out. A seat for Bosco right here. There you go. You any good with a brush? Okay, good. Need some help. You need some varnish, get the drips off, go back and forth slow. Put a bit more pressure on that if you want. (timer ringing) Enough work, time for cookies. Irina, you make the best chocolate chip cookies in the whole world. Not the whole world, Seattle maybe. And the milk Marcus. Never let a buddy drink alone. Drink up. Let's get some air. It's getting cold Marcus. You better put your jacket on dear. No, I'm okay. Yeah, It's getting, it's getting kind of nippy out there. Remember your mom's chocolate chip cookies? I don't really remember my mom. Oh yeah, that's right you were kind of little when she. Anyway, she made me cookies once, the other time I worked here, she was a real nice lady, she's real pretty. And she's funny. She loved you so much. How much? As much as any mom ever loved a kid in the history of the entire universe. It's not fair. Yeah. Hey, but you got a lot of stuff to make up for it. And most people live their whole lives, they never even see a place like this unless they're delivering your dry cleaning or sneaking at your pipes. How many kids have a nanny and a cook? Yeah, I know they're paid to be nice to you, but you know, life is full of trade offs. You're paid to be nice to meet Alex? No, Marcus I'm your friend. (cartoon music) Look out. Look out. There we go. Oh, one more. Hey, I'd love it too, but it's getting late. We don't want Roberta to get her panties in a bunch, now do we? You brush your teeth, get your jammies on. I'll tuck you in. That's okay, my dad will tuck me in when he gets home. Cool, yeah. That's what dads are for, right? And that's how you know they love you. Okay go brush your teeth. Hey, what are you looking for? Oscar bear, can't find him. Couldn't find king Kong in this place. He'll turn up, go brush your teeth. See you tomorrow, bud. Bye Alex. It was sweet of you to keep Marcus company. Hey, it's fun for me. I'm sure you have more exciting things to do with your evenings. Not really, you, well, you Marcus and Irina. You've started to feel like to me. We feel the same way, when your job is finished here, please stay a part of our family. It would be good for Marcus. He's become very attached to you. And he's usually such a loner. Yeah, I guess when you're your mother's dead, your father has no time for you, it's good to be a loner. Don't say that about Dan, he adores Marcus. That's why he is never around. It's not easy for Dan to juggle his responsibilities, he does the best can, he really does. He was never around the last time I was here. When Mrs. Carlin, she was already sick. You were always trying to get her to lie down and she's determined to spend every minute she can with Marcus. And he realized how precious those minutes were. Yeah, well, how parents should realize that. Hey, doggy bag. Wow. What's, what's that salmon thing called again? Koulibiaka. Koulibiaka? Koulibiaka, I forget, I can't say it. Don't say it, just eat it. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Drive safe. Good night sachinka. Love it, when she calls me that. I'm ready for a cup of tea. How about you? Hey, you're working awful late. I got fed, watched some videos with Marcus. Oh good. Oh good, I'm glad. And by the way, the entertainment room's looking great. You haven't lost your touch. Oh, thanks Mr. Carlin. It's just lucky Roy knew who I was talking about, 'cause I just said to him, get me the guy who did such a beautiful job with it den and he knew exactly who I meant anyway. Oh, hey Marcus is fast asleep, I wouldn't wake him. Geez. I always tuck him in. And I know, and that means a lot. It's just, he had, it's a hard time falling asleep tonight. I Be ashamed to pull 'em out of it. Yeah, okay. Anyway, good night. Hey everybody. Oh, I saved some for you Koulibiaka for you. Oh, thanks Irina. I, I grabbed a burger on the way home. No. I thought of what you could do for Marcus? The ice show was in town. He loves those big cartoon character skating around. That's great, great. I'll get some tickets and I'll surprise him tomorrow night. Okay. (somber music) (door shutting) (somber music) Morning sunshine? Hey let me, okay. Thank you. Yes, I know. It's mommy. Doesn't that look good? Mommy knows how to do these things. Yes sweetie, she does. How do you do that? Don't forget to wash your face. See you tonight. Hey, got some ironing for you when you're done with that. I know you're kidding, but I really wouldn't mind. Oh, hey, you got your hands full already. Hey speaking, which I gotta, I gotta run around town today. Pick up some supplies. I thought maybe I could take Marcus with me. I get him outta your hair for a couple hours. Marcus. Isn't getting my hair. He's a very self-sufficient six year old. Yeah, he spends too much time alone. Come on, let me take him out for a while. You know, I'll tool around on my pickup truck hit some hardware stores and lumber yards. Take him out to a diner where workers just hang out with you. We could sit at the counter of pancakes with tons of syrup. Come on, you know he'd love it. Your truck does have seat belts. Nice and tight. (engine revving) Be good Marcus. Now I want you to know that I'm with you 'cause I wanna be, not because Roberta begged me to take you off her hands for the day, okay? What? Yeah, yeah it turns out she's more tired of you than we thought, but who cares right? We're gonna have some fun. Hey, what did I burn you out? I'm sorry buddy. Look, I know it's sad. You gotta, you got a nanny sick of a job. You gotta cook that makes you eat weird foreign food. Daddy has no time for you, but you know what it's 'cause they take you for granted. They don't realize how much they're gonna miss you if you're, if you're not around. And you know something, I bet if you suddenly disappeared, they'd get worried, right? And the more worried they got, the more they miss you, the more they missed you, the more they'd realize how much they love you. (somber music) All we gotta do is hide you just overnight. I'll let them know how to find you in the morning. But where am I gonna hide. Someplace really cool. A secret Treehouse. Really. (ominous music) Flippos, can I have one Alex please? Only if I can have one too. My dad wouldn't buy me one yesterday. Why not? Said he didn't have time. I think, all that's gonna change. Morning. Two flippos please. Okay, and what will you have? Here you go doll face and one for big doll face. Oh no, keep it. Oh, thanks. How old's your son? Six. He's a sweet kid. You're lucky. Yeah, I am. It doesn't think much to make you happy, does it? I was like that too. They don't know. Parents don't know How little it takes. Yeah. He brought me here, my dad to go fishing. It was a beautiful day and then we both caught fish and he caught more, which you know, made it okay. Never yelled at me. Not once. Whole day. I was happy, that's all it took. Mookies. Oh what milk cows? Look, there's a chocolate one. Where? Right there, right there by the low fat one. I'm Kidding. (church bell ringing) Don't worry. We're not there yet. Wow. Welcome to your secret treehouse. Cool. Here's your bed, you can, you can jump up and down on this if you want. Got favorite videos, cartoons. Look here, we got milk, juice, soda, sandwiches, carrots, Ice cream, Cookies, potato chips. Don't just eat the junk though, okay. All kinds of fun stuff here. Nothing too educational. It's got nice new jammies. When you get sleepy. Come here, brand new toothbrush. Come here, everything you need, huh? Tomorrow morning, your dad, your nanny are gonna miss you so much. They're gonna come and get you and everything's gonna be fine. How do you know, I'm gonna make sure. You're gonna talk into this. Hello? Oh, hold it. I'm gonna tell you what to say. I want you to say, "hi daddy, if you wanna see me again, please do what Alex tells you to do." Think you can say that. Good. Say it after me. Hi daddy. Hi daddy. If you wanna see me again. If you wanna see me again. Please do what Alex tells you to do. Please do what Alex tells you to do. Good, wanna try it? Hi daddy. (Marcus giggles) mookies. You can't clown around buddy. This has got to be serious, okay? Okay? Let's try again. Hi daddy, if you wanna see me again, please do what Alex tells you to do. Very good, it was very, very good. Well have fun. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I almost forgot. I almost forgot. Look who came to keep you company. Bosco. So I'm gonna lock the door just so you stays safe. Come here, everything's gonna be fine, okay. Your dad's gonna be here tomorrow morning. I promise You be brave until then, okay? See you buddy. Bye, Alex. (door locking) He said a few hours. I should have made him be more specific. You seem worried. You think something has happened? Alex would've called. What if something happened to him? I've sewn identification on Marcus' clothing, we would've heard from someone. (Irina speaking in foreign language) Thank God. See you worry too much. Where's Marcus? Where's where's Marcus? Where's Marcus? So where'd you get the specs for these cargo holes? (indistinct) Yes, Maggie. Brooke's calling you, she says it's important. I put her through, what is it Roberta? I need you at home Dan, right away. What, is it Marcus? Please just come home. (timer ringing) Go ahead. Go. I'm not gonna hurt you. Sit down. Stop it. Stop it. Okay. I have to talk to Mr. Carlin. I know you both care about Marcus, so you're gonna do whatever I ask. All I ask is that you do nothing. No leaving, no calling don't disappoint me. What's happened? Did, did something happen to Marcus? Not yet. Hi daddy, if you wanna see me again. Please do what Alex tell you to do. What have you done to him? Have you hurt him? I love Marcus, I'd never hurt him or even scare him. He thinks we're playing a game. So what is it? You want money I assume. $500,000 cash, today. You can manage that, right? I'll do whatever you want. I'm not gonna jeopardize my son, but what's in your head. How can you even imagine that you'll get away with this. I'll get away I've got the, I've got the perfect plan. Oh, you don't think so. Well you don't, you don't think I'm smart enough. Okay, let's see how smart you are. Quick, I'm flying to Rio, tell me why? Come on quick, quick. Brazil, Brazil doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. That's very good. I have to look that up on the internet. When I get to Rio, I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you where Marcus is. That'll be 7:00 AM. Pacific daylight time. What makes you think that you could even get on the plane? The, cops will shut down the whole airport. Only if you call them, you're not gonna call them. This little guy, he's got a twin. Only difference is that the twin goes boom. It's sewn inside Bosco bear. It's set to go off tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. Last time I saw Bosco, Marcus was holding him real tight. (cartoon music) You like it. No, I know Brad, but just just listen. Okay. Yes, 500,000 cash. But no, not a cashier's cheque, cash. Right away this afternoon. I can't explain it Brad just have the cash ready by the time I get there okay. Thanks. Wow guy like me, I go to the bank to get 50 bucks. I gotta show 12 pieces of identification. So how do we do this? Am I driving or are you driving? Not coming. I know you'll be back, alone with the money. Mr. Carlin, you left me alone in your house hundreds of times, I'm not gonna swipe anything. Dan, call the police. I can't. The police have interrogators, negotiators, they'll reason with him break him down. And if they fail, I've learned to trust my instincts in a business deal. And that's what this is, it's business. I believe that he'll keep his end to the bargain if I keep mine, Roberta, please trust me on this. Tickets for the ice show tonight. Don't do anything please. It's gonna be okay, we'll have Marcus back safe and sound. We will. You did some lovely work in here. I guess someone else will have to finish it now. Yeah. So it was all just an act. You're kindness to Marcus, flatter you to Irina and me. You were just taking advantage of an impressionable boy and a couple of foolish spinsters. No, I meant all of it. And how was it possible for you to do what you're doing? I knew you'd be disappointed in me. So I just kind of had to not think about it. Where is he? Wait, five minutes then bring him some milk and cookies. How can you ask me such a thing? I have a feeling I can get through to him. Help me with this Irina please. How many people know about this? No one else. I got varying amounts from different tellers. Not aware of who it was for. You know, I have to report to the government. Any cash transactions over $10,000. I know, yeah its fine. Nobody needs this kind of cash for something legal. I'll explain okay, just don't ask me about it now. Wherever you're taking it, let me send a guard with you. No, I have to do this or... Marcus, oh Dan, no. Don't do anything Brad. Swear to me. Swear. Okay. Okay. Thanks Good luck. I've never seen you smoke. guess I'm full of surprises. Is it just about money? You could make good money with your skills, you're young, you've got your whole life ahead of you. I'm a working stiff. I come from a long line of working stiffs. Hourly wage types, I mean, I'm a high school dropout who's good with his hands. I can only get you so far. Hit me, when I came back here to work this time. I'm never gonna live like this. No matter how hard I work, guess that thought kind of bummed me out. So you decided to punish Mr. Carlin for it? I'm not punishing him, tomorrow morning he'll have his kid back and believe me he'll have already figured out a way to write the whole thing off. Maybe you'll appreciate Marcus a bit more. Everybody wins. This just happened I guess it's Marcus' milk and cookie time. (car hooting) (siren blaring) I ran the light, I know. I saw how you were driving before you got to the light. How many drinks have you had? None. I've had no drinks. Marcus must be terrified. All tied up in some strange place. He's not tied up. But then who's ever guarding him. Must be intimidating enough to keep him from running away. He's not tied up. Nobody's guarding him, he's having fun. Wish everybody just relax about it. I told you I'm not drunk. I need to see your registration. Okay, yeah. Here. Thanks. If he gets afraid he could cry out for help. Unless of course you've gagged him. Didn't gag him. There's nobody there to hear it, just stop it. He's fine, I didn't hurt him. Marcus is afraid of the dark, is there light where you left him? I forgot to show him how to turn on the lights. He's a smart kid, he'll figure it out. There's a switch by the door, land by the bed. So he's locked up in a house somewhere. You trying to trick me? (glass shuttering) Is that it. You know, once you're safely away with the money, you could change your mind. Why would you, why would you call and risk further contact? If I don't call Marcus will die. Would you think I'd let Marcus die? Look, his life is in your hands, not mine. It's all there. You wanna know how easy it was to get Marcus to go along with this. It was so easy, because he loves me more than he loves you. You couldn't even buy him a lousy ice cream bar. You don't deserve him, just like, just like you didn't deserve Annie. No, stop. Stop. Call 9 1 1. Is he dead? No, but he's the only person who knows where Marcus is. Call 9 1 1, now. What can you tell me about Mr Alex? He was a nice man. He was like one of the family to us. Name and address are the same on his license and registration. Run a check on the truck as well. Okay, thanks. Mr. Carlin. He hurt my pride. My son might die because of my stupid pride. Let's hold off on that crap, okay. We've only got a few hours to find you your little boy. Please get in. (sirens blaring) No, no, no. Charlie, Charlie, I don't, I don't need you here. I'm not being charged with anything. No, look I, no, I need you to find if I'm in good hands, okay. It's detective Janet Wise. Yeah, all right call me back. This Alex Redman guy, how did you pay him? Redman? I didn't even know his last name. The contractor paid him, I paid the contractor. I let a guy into my house every day for weeks, I don't know a thing about him. Well, that's not unusual. You need a plumber, they send someone out. You're not looking to find a new friend. You just want the toilet to flush. So what's the plan when he comes to, who's gonna be there? Who who'll be questioning him? Me. Okay. No offense, but how experienced are you? How many of these have you done? I've done my share. Feel free to check me out. No, that's okay. I'm sure they would've sent someone good. Just we only have 15 hours left. And you can't just wait around for him to wake up. We gotta make every second count. Oh, there's plenty we can do. For starters, you can write down your contractor's name and phone number. I'll add it to the mix and see what he can tell us. (Annie breathing heavily) I can't do it alone. I can't, I just can't do this without you. (phone ringing) What is it? Which crane fell? Anybody hurt? Oh God, okay look, I'll be there. Just tell everyone I'll be there. Alex Redman no longer lives at the address on his license and registration. There's no forwarding information. He has no arrest record, not even a, an unpaid parking ticket. What about the- Your contractor, he couldn't help us out either. He pays Redman in cash and the only number he has for him is a pager. All he knows about Redman is that he's a good, reliable worker. Less than 15 hours left. If assuming he was telling you the truth about the time bomb. Assuming. We'll be acting on that assumption, of course. So, what are we doing? Let's let's let's do something. Let's keep this moving huh? It's moving. I've asked FBI for assistance, three agents are on their way over here. That's it three? We've got the manpower, I just want the additional guidance. I've worked with agent Wayne before and he's bringing a bomb expert. That's him. What's happening? Where are you taking him? He's going into surgery. There's a swelling in his brain and we need to drain the fluid. How long will it take? When will he wake up? Well, there's no assurance that he will wake up. We just have to give it time. Wait, we don't have time look, who's your chief surgeon, I want your chief surgeon on this. Sir, I'm aware of your situation and I can assure you everything that can be done is being done. Now, if you'll excuse me, wait here. Okay. If Alex we're already dead, if there were no chance of questioning him, would you be doing right now? You got a picture of Marcus on you. This, this was a while ago. I'm gonna need something a little more recent. I wanna release photos of him and, and Alex Redman to the local TV stations. I'll have his nanny send one over. Okay, I'll send a car. And I'm gonna offer a reward for information leading to Marcus' safe return. Rewards attract bogus calls that ends up wasting precious time. I need to know I'm doing everything I can do. This is one thing I can do. I'm against it. Well, it's not your son who is kidnapped. If Marcus dies, you still get to go home to your loved ones. If you have any. I'm sorry. Skip it. Let's wait till agent Wayne gets here. If he okays with reward, I'll go along with it. I'm supposed to defer to him? He's the top kidnapping investigator in the state. It's me, Roberta. What's the most recent picture you have of Marcus? Please let, let me do that. Keep going, we gotta get this out. Agent Wayne, I need to know the percentages. Okay, how many kidnapping get solved? How many victims come out alive. Kidnapping for ransom isn't very common in this country believe it or not. It's too hard to get away with. Most kidnappers are eventually apprehended. And the victims. Most kidnapping victims are dead before ransom is even requested. I don't believe Marcus is dead. I believe Alex told me the truth. So do I? He said Marcus is alone. Not tied up that no one would hear if he called for help. He's in a house somewhere. He used the word house, not I think I said that. He asked that that's what set him off. That's when he realized I was grilling him. Without speculation Mrs.(indistinct) All right, I'm sorry. There's a light switch by a door and a lamp by a bed. (cartoon music) Lisa (indistinct) will be here at 10 with all the days' news, plus Andy, with the final scores in Frank. Here's your tuna boots. We have a breaking story. You won't have to do your little seduction number. Various citizens might have seen this child today in the company of this man. Six year old Marcus Carlin was allegedly abducted by 27 year old Alex Redman out of Seattle. Police are asking anyone who knows Alex Redman to contact at this number. A $500,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the safe return of little Marcus. We will have full coverage of this developing story on news 10. When we come back after these messages, we'll check the latest sports. (ominous music) Where is she? Where is she? Basketball league was busy last night, with seven games on the schedule, the cavalier came up with (indistinct) I let Annie die alone. You left her for an hour, you had no way of knowing. She died alone Roberta and I didn't even learn anything from it. I just threw myself into my work and kept Marcus at arms length so I wouldn't have to feel anything. Mr. Carlin. (Alex speaking in gibberish) Alex, can you hear me, Alex? Do you know where you are Alex? Huh? Where's dad. I'm right here. He didn't say Dan, he said dad. Dad. Hey dad, Alex, where's Marcus's? The other boy couldn't catch any fish. Because he didn't have a pole. I should have bought him a pole. I knew you'd be mad if I caught more fish than you. So I stopped bating the. Could we come here and get this? He's crashing, let's go. Give us room, give us room. Wait outside please. I'm sorry I'm late. Sorry, sorry. Hi. Hi. Hi buddy, hi Alex. I was gonna put the leg together. It's okay, yeah hello. Okay. Hold down just tighter. Okay, do you wanna hold this for me? Yeah. Was a massive blood clot or maybe a ruptured aneurysm. Is he's conscious. He's dead. (cartoon music) Don't worry (indistinct) we'll get up at five in the morning and really black that (indistinct) rabbit. Must hate that rabbit now. Remember, boy you'll never catch that rabbit unless you get a good night sleep. A kidnapper is dead and his victims, whereabouts remains a mystery at this hour. Local police and FBI are urgently appealing for public help. A $500,000 reward has been offered for any information leading to the safe return of six year old Marcus Carlin. Really think there could be an accompany out there. Agent Wayne always covers his bases. Now the nanny said Redman and Marcus left the house at 8:15. And Alex got back at 1:20. Five hours. Let's estimate the maximum distance. Presuming no stops along the way and giving him an hour to secure the boy in the hiding place. That's two hours each way in midday traffic. All right, just a second. Okay, your son could be as far north, as Canada, as far south as Oregon or to the east half way to Idaho. He won't be two hours away. Alex said he would call me it's 7:00 AM giving us three hours to reach Marcus. I believe he would've cut it that close. With all respect, Mr. Carlin, this is a pretty twisted guy. We can't know what was in his head. He didn't want Marcus to die. He would've given us time to get there. I didn't mean to kill him. Nobody is doubting that. You won't be charged, the only thing you did wrong, Mr. Carlin was to deal with him. You should have called police first thing. We were on that job three months give or take. We'd hang out some nights, grab a few beers, whatever. Once I drove him to his house. Do you remember where? Yeah, yeah around Clyde hill. Well he moved from there two months ago, you don't know where he's been living recently? Oh, hell I haven't talked to the guy in two years. It's not like we were good buddies or anything. Right, thanks for coming in Luke. Yeah, I do, I've got it. I wasn't much help was I. Well, I don't think you're gonna win the jackpot if that's what you mean. Hey, I didn't come here for a reward. I came to help a little kid missing. Sorry. Rewards make me cynical. Yeah, no kidding. Well, if you can think of anything else, just call my pager number. Thank you. Yes Ma'am. We keep getting calls from people who knew him, but it seems like nobody really knew him. Those two calls from people who saw Redman and the boy, oh one was a crank. The other, an honest mistake. You said those leads were too good to be true. Why do you have to be right? I take no pleasure in being right. If that means anything to you. I don't get it, their faces have been on TV all night. Someone's gotta have seen them. Not necessarily. They could have driven straight from your house to the hiding place. They still would've had to pass by hundreds of people. Thousands of people. How could no one have seen them? You've been all over the city today Dan, just how many strangers did you actually focus on? I saw them together, it was this morning near Bellevue. Miss Daley. You can call me Allison. Okay, Allison, what makes you so sure that it was them? Well, I saw their faces on the 10 o'clock news and I just, I remember their faces. And what was so memorable? Well, I thought the guy was cute. I was just driving along and I saw this cute guy getting out of a truck with a little boy. What kind of a truck? It was a pick up, kind of an old one, but fixed up, you know, it was painted blue. Go on, what else did you see? They just went into a house, that's all I saw. And I just drove on. Do you remember the address? Oh, well, not exactly, but I'm sure I could lead you to it. Let's go. Come on. Agent Wayne. (sirens blaring) You'll always have me. This is definitely the street. The house is up there, the green one on the left. We've located the house, the address is 3 2 5. We're stopping across the street. we see, kill your lights. Police officers, open the door. Go. (door breaking) Check closets, attic, basement. Two Clear, nothing here. Detective wise. Gotten his passport and a one way ticket to Rio. And no sign of the child? Well obviously they stopped here the girl saw them. Bag it. You can come on in. Gather up any scraps of paper with handwriting or scribbled notes with a person's name, address or phone number? Directions of any kind, receipts for gas. Oh Dan, Alex Redman moved here or at least was staying here. Marcus. No sign of him. I'm sorry. But this is, this is progress. We're making progress. We're putting it all together. Allison you've been really helpful. Maybe you can help us out a little bit more. What time exactly did you see Redman and the boy? I don't know exactly. Well, let's work it out. Where were you coming from, where were you headed? I was on my way to visit a friend. Where did your friend live? Near here. What time did you get here? What's this? Agent Wayne It's a, it's a trap door. Marcus. Get back, Mr. Carlin please. Marcus. Mr. Carlin come on. Open it. (rat squeaking) What do you see, do you see anything? Is anybody there? Nothing here, nothing. Agent Wayne. Sir, this was found in the backpack. Raymond's address book. It's pretty lean we could contact of the name in here. You and Murphy get on your mobiles and work your way through the names. All right. Okay. Janet Wise. Well, the doctor said he's gonna be like this till the stitches come out. When did he last have aspirin? Aha mom, why don't you just read to him? Yeah. No, not that one. It's just gonna make him laugh, it will hurt. Why don't you read the (indistinct). Someone cared about him, huh? When was the last time you saw or spoke with Alex Redman? Something's up with her. Datey, Datey, Datey. Allison. Al. (ominous music) Kelly grab her, get her. Hey, hey, hey you stop. We met at the hardware store where I work. He was the most attractive guy I'd ever met. And the nicest. We started going out and I saw something in him. Something's sad and fragile, like a wounded puppy. I just wanted to take care of him. I think that maybe I was the first person that ever loved him. And I did love him I won't deny it. We Moved in here a couple months ago and that's when things started getting weird. He started going on about how we were working stiffs and now he wanted to take me away from it all. A month ago, he came up with the idea to kidnap that little boy. I was against it, but he made me believe that it would be so easy. And that nobody was gonna get hurt. That the little boy wouldn't get scared. He was gonna turn the cellar into some kind of a playroom. And then hide the little boy down there, but then he started building a bomb. That's when I freaked, we had a big fight about it. And I moved out, I never thought he was gonna go through with it, not with me out of his life. He'd said he was doing it for me. And I saw his face on the news, I couldn't believe it. I didn't call it first because I was scared. I was scared I was gonna get in trouble. But the moment they said he'd died I knew I was safe. Safe in helping you find that little boy, And safe in collecting our reward. Where's my son. I thought he'd be here. Where else could Redman have taken him? I don't know. I don't have any idea. Well, you're gonna talk to us until you get an idea. (sky grumbling) (indistinct) don't lose your place. Now that we've made our selections and have our design, we're ready to plant. These are the three tools that I use for planting. I use shovel for planting seeds. Thanks Irina. My pleasure. Yeah, I do, I've got it. We'll wake up a judge. We need to search Allison Daley's apartment. This was Ms. Daley. (police talking in the background) Hey daddy, if you wanna see me again? Please do what Alex tells you to do. I have no other record of his voice. I stopped making home videos when he was two. When my wife. What if this is the only record I'll ever have of his voice? Maybe I should have someone take you home. I'll call you the minute we know anything. My son may only have seven hours left to live. I don't feel much like napping. When'd he draw that? I don't know. I've missed out on him so much. No one's fault, but mine. The other day, My eight year old was clowning around at school and fell through a window. It was a first floor window, he, he had some cuts, a few stitches, he'll be fine, but the message on my pager, didn't say that it said Jake fell out a window and was at children's hospital. On my way there, I remembered Jake kept trying to tell me, tell me this joke that morning. And I was just too busy to listen to him. I kept saying, tell me later, later tell me later. And now I was going crazy thinking. What if he dies and never tells me his joke? It was so important to him at the hospital. My husband, ex-husband was there and Jake was already patched up. And I went over to my kid and gave him a big fat kiss. And I say, okay, now tell me your joke. It's was a really stupid joke, but the best one I ever heard. Oh, I want you to have a second chance with him. I am doing everything I can. Mookies, hi daddy. If You wanna see me again please. Hi daddy, mookies. Oh my God. There's something at the beginning of this tape. It's like a, a false start, listen. Hi daddy, (Marcus giggling) mookies. He's saying mookies. It's his old baby talk nickname for cows. The computer can give us a list of cattle owners within radius and then we'll know how daunting a task this is or isn't. Agent Wayne, I'm telling you you've drawn it too wide. He, didn't take Marcus two hours away. He would've made sure that we could get there in time. You keep saying that Mr. Carlin, why all this blind faith in someone who kidnapped your child? Look, I'm not such a brilliant father, but I know how to make a deal. And what Alex and I had was a deal. Reduce the radius to one hour. I agree, his flight to Rio. The arrival time was exactly as he said, I think that he meant to deliver on his promise. All right, let's do it. Well, we either just increased our chances or we've increased our self delusion. Wake up Jack Marino, give him these coordinates. I wanna know the location of every damn cow within an hour of here, go. There's still time. Want more coffee? Yeah, sure. Papers. Morning. Hi, Ann. Is there any banana cream in there? Two pieces, you want 'em both. Why the hell not? Detective wise. Detective Janet Wise. Dan it's, Alex Redman's mother. It was kind of a falling out you might say, back when Alex was 16, Bill that's Alex's dad. He could be a little rough on the boy. Hell on this one occasion, he was smacking Alex around and Alex hauled off and slugged him back. Nothing like that had ever happened before. Kind of surprised the hell out of all of us. Alex included, Bill kicked him out, said never come back. Alex kind of always held it against me that I didn't intervene. Ms. Redman, when did you last see him or hear from him? Oh, we'd catch up every now and again. Especially after I left Bill. I think the last time we spoke was around the holidays. I mailed him some pumpkin bread and he called to say thanks. Mrs. Redman. I'm sorry your son is dead, but please don't let him take my son with him. What can I do? Just tell me what to do. In the hospital. Alex was on morphine, he was delusional. He thought we were on a fishing trip that I was his dad. And he talked about the other little boy. I think he meant Marcus. I think there was reality in his delusion. Where can we find your ex-husband? (sirens blaring) I always knew he'd come to no good. Mr. Redman, what about the fishing trips? Where did do you used to take Alex fishing? Fishing trips. Hell you make it sound like Andy and Opie. We didn't have any damn fishing trips. We didn't do anything together. Guess you were too busy knocking him around huh? Oh, right. You're one of those. It's all my fault for what he turned into. Well how about I didn't hit him enough. Do you ever think of that? We off the track here, let's back it up. Mr. Redman, your son's final words were directed to you now think hard about what he said. Really think about it and see if it makes any sense to you at all. Well, there, there was this one time hell he was so damn little, but there was this one day, I took him to one of the islands and we went fishing on some little stream was so long ago. I mean, why would he remember that? Which island? I don't know just out in the sound somewhere. That's where he took Marcus. Well, which island? We don't have time to be wrong. I think we can narrow it down. I dunno what you mean. Islands in the sound was one special to him. Okay I'm- Think fast, come on. He used to like taking the ferry to Bainbridge island. Bainbridge. There's still some farms over there. Bainbridge. (helicopters chopping) The Bainbridge police have cars waiting for us. At the first farm I have copies of the computer search farms with cattle. We'll split into four units. Confirmed. They know the bomb is set to go off at 10 o'clock. So let's keep it moving. Roger. (dramatic music) Go, move it, move it, move it. (sirens blaring) (church bell ringing) (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) Is there anything up there? Nothing up here. (dramatic music) Dad's supposed to come and pick us up. ♪ Hush little Marcus don't you cry ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sing you a lullaby ♪ ♪ Hush little Marcus don't you cry ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sing you a lullaby. ♪ ♪ Hush little Marcus don't you cry ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sing you a lullaby. ♪ We're stuck out. Yeah, okay. We're going to regroup. Regroup. We're going to the ferry landing and retracing their steps. He's waiting for me somewhere. He's waiting for me to take him home. (siren blaring) They could only have driven down. One of those two roads was split up. Go store to store. House to house. Yep. Okay guys. Flippo bars. I couldn't even buy him a lousy ice cream bar. You couldn't even buy him a lousy ice cream bar. Did you see them? Have you seen them? Yes, yesterday right here. What's going on? She saw them, they were here. Marcus is here. Do you have any idea where they went? No, just to a truck. They drove off in a truck, a blue truck in this direction. did you see where they were going? Anything either of them? No, I don't think so. No will, somebody please tell me what's going on. Oh my God. (dramatic music) This young man was in here. Where? Quite recently I, I remember him, he was so handsome and polite. What, what was he doing here? He rented a house. Where where's the house? Oh dear, it wasn't my transaction. Let me think, let me think. Try to remember just- With a big rundown old thing. Okay where, where was it? You'd have to ask Phil. Who's Phil? Where's Phil? Phil was the agent, he should be here any minute. The rental agreement. Can you get the rental agreement, get it find it. Yeah, we got a bullseye. Where are you. Phil's very fastidious. You're just gonna have to wait until he gets here with the key. Are you kidding? Would you stop that. Sir, stop that. (Dan banging the office desk) Would you put the scissors down? It's okay. Shoot it, shoot the lock. What? Are you Phil? (siren blaring) Go around that bend. (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) How much farther? How much farther? Just past this farm inside those trees. You can't see the house. It's hidden up a little dirt path. Right up there. You can barely see it. We were here, we were right here. Hold on, what is that? (timer ticking) No, no. Dan. Get off the road. FBI, we need to get through, move it off the road damn it. We got an emergency. (water running) (timer ticking) No. (water running) (sirens blaring) No, Marcus. Bosco, you need a bath. (timer ticking) Marcus. (church bell ringing) (door breaking) Marcus. Daddy, daddy. Marcus can you hear me? Daddy. Marcus. Stay back away from the door. (church bell ringing) (door breaking) Hi daddy. Knew you'd come. Come one move it, lets go. Come on move, move, move. Get away from away from the house. Move away from the house. Daddy, what's going on? Where's Bosco? Having a bath. All clear. Gotta go get him. Oh, he'll come home a little later. The cops just need to ask him a few questions. (cool music)
