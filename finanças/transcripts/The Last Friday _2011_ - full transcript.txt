And we begin our news tour with the A! Jazeera channel which said that an extensive investigation has been conducted by a team of international independent technical experts who confirmed the claim of interference of an Al Jazeera Sports Channel during the broadcast of the FIFA World Cup, and the experts were able to identify the site from which the interference originated which is near the city of Salt, Jordan, and noted that this site is deliberately interfering with the broadcast signal of A! Jazeera Sports resulting in interference of the live broadcast of a number of World Cup matches. "The Guardian" newspaper confirms this hypothesis and further more based on the secret documents that refer to the site of interference being in Jordan and more specifically near the city of Salt. which used in the process advanced equipment that interrupts the origin of the signal transmission and the British newspaper assured, based on the experts' quotes that this has occurred with the knowledge of the Jordanian government in what appears to be linked to anger in Jordan after failing to reach an agreement with Al Jazeera Sports from banks and currencies to the prices that are changing day after day... Well... I need two hours and I'll be back. Could you please turn it down a little bit? Of course I'm by myself! Who would I be with? No! Do not come by unless you give me a call first. Can I be honest with you? I don't want you in my life anymore. In Amman, hundreds of Jordanians protested against the repression and intimidation of journalists which took place when they organized a protest under the name. The Friday for Dignity and Freedom of Expression. The demonstrators burned an American flag to protest what they called the U.S. intervention in the policies of the Jordanian Government, and called for the resignation of the Prime Minister as well as demanding freedom of the press. Last Friday, a violence fight broke out when police tried to break up a demonstration that called for reform. Many journalists were injured. From Amman, the bureau chief, Yasser Abu Hilal, will report on the details. Yasser, what was the extent of the fight and what will happen now? Demonstrations swept a number of Jordanian cities south in Maan, and in the south, in Karak and Tafieleh and Irbid in the north. This Friday called for reform but brutal repression by the police resulted in many of journalists being injured and hospitalized. Prior to the demonstration, a meeting by King Abduflah II and the official representative of the journalist, Tareq Momani took place yesterday, and the message meeting was clear... It will do for couple of days. Can you take me to the airport? What for? I finally got my visa. So what about the money? Be patient with me. I need it now! What's the rush? I have to have surgery. Surgery for what? When was the last time you checked the oil? No need... the engine is the problem. The car keeps shutting off... This isn't working... You want me to keep going on like this? I don't get it... what do you want? Just fix the engine. Fouad, get me the notebook... it's in the drawer. You've got 300 dinars worth of fines since last year. When are you going to pay them? I'm going to be honest with you... In general, I'm unhappy with your performance. If you don't shape up within a week, you give me the cab back and go. What happened? The front part is totally wrecked. So, when will it be done? Half a day. So what are you waiting for? Get back to work. You think you're the only one with dignity in this world. And what if I told you to buzz off? A couple of days ago you called me a jackass! Or do you only use etiquette when... What are you up to? I'm bored out of my mind. Going to work. Mom, are you going out tonight? Then can you leave me your car keys... I'm going out but I won't be late. You're going out every day now? I'm going to a graduation party. Take a cab. You want me to step out of the hair salon into the street and hail a cab? No way! The first time I ever went to a salon was on my wedding day. Did you add your father on Facebook? I don't want to. Why? Because I don't want to. Add him! Mama, can you stop acting like a teenager. Let me know when you add him. What do you really want from all this? Will you give me the keys or not? Didn't your dad say he'd buy you a car? Talk to him... Message? Call him! I don't feel like it. And, anyway, I don't have credit. Your father doesn't answer messages. You'll see... I'll keep sending until he answers. How's your boyfriend, the mechanic? Mom, he's not a "mechanic". Jaber is a mechanical engineer. Darling, men are stupid creatures. Don't comfort him, don't ever let him feel safe. You have to always keep him worried... afraid. Don't you dare tell him that you love him. No! He told me loves me. Don't say it until he loses hope from waiting. Jaber... I've been a taxi driver for a while now... When will you give me my old job back? We still don't have any openings. It's been 5 years. You know more than anyone what I can do for the showroom sales. You're the one who left to go work in the Gulf. Imad, what were you doing on their roof? Do you want us to get in trouble with the neighbors? "After a women has found her way into a man's heart, she will seek to control him, and there are many ways she can keep that control like, for example, if he has a submissive personality, or h' he is poor and she is not. She could also be sadistic and he could be unable to stand up for himself Moreover, the women's family is could be wealthy and have power in society increasing the psychological pressure. AH of these things could cause the husband to surrender and remain silent in the face of abuse. In fact, in the Arab world today in only 7% of cases do men started to admit to the violence they face and they do not fully recognized it until they have reached a severe stage of depression and abuse. And so when we try to know and understand the reason for their depression we uncover the truth of the violence. I've missed you, kid. Pretty soon you'll be as tall as me. I might be taller. So why weren't you two talking? She was upset. Why? I was supposed to wait for her outside. Maybe she was afraid that her mom would see her with you. Is that why you went up? I waited but she didn't come out. No... this goes here. Dad, I need a new wheel for my bike. Don't, don't. And the money? Didn't you say it's ready? Come pick it up? What's wrong with you, man? Do I have to tell you I don't have more than 20 dinars in my account? If you are so in need, why don't you take from Imad's savings? He's still young, and when you have money again you put it back. So, why don't you go back to the Gulf? When my mother was dying and I wanted to come visit. My fucking employer wouldn't give me my passport back. So I went to the police and reported. They threw me in their jeep with criminals and asked him to follow in his car! I stayed there waiting for that motherfucker for half a day. And what was the response? Sort it out yourself". Well, all you can do is play and try your luck again. Luck? What luck? I lost two years of work in one night. Good thing I registered under her name before I... The apartment she didn't like because it didn't have the garden she wanted! By the way, does she still rent it out fully furnished? I still don't get it, Fouad. You've got your family and a good job. You're supposed to be doing well. So why do you want to leave? Man, it's been three months with no salary. And you say I'm doing well. And the last time I asked Jaber to pay me. He acted like a beggar with no money. What's the story with this operation? Today, I felt this strong pain come and go. It turns out I have a twisted testicle. So now I need surgery. The doctor say it's a simple procedure. It's going to take 15 minutes and it's over. But I have a bad feeling about it. Man, the pain will go on its own. The thing is, the doctor says if I don't do it before Friday it will get worse and they might cut it off. So what... if they cut it off, you still have the other one. Do you know which one is yours? Which apartment? Number 7. Do YOU pay the bill? I always pay- Seems some bastard stole your plug. I think I have one at my place somewhere. If you're looking for a meter plug, there's an extra one... Do you know which meter is yours? Which apartment? Number 7. ...did not reveal is identity for Britain's "The Guardian" newspaper, that Jordan was behind the confusion on Al Jazeera television channel during the 2010 World Cup and the source said, that these allegations are false and unacceptable and that the government is ready to cooperate with any neutral expert team to check all facts and the Jordanian government is confident that such an examination will reveal the invalidity of such allegations. The source expressed the government's refusal to the speculation and opinions expressed by Al-Jazeera, to the Guardian newspaper about the reaction of Jordan to the failure of negotiations of buying the rights of broadcasting locally for the world cup, and in this regard the source pointed out that Jordan had spoken officially with Al-Jazeera on the purchase of broadcasting rights four months before the beginning of the World Cup. However, Al-Jazeera began actual negotiations only days before the start of... Yusef, it's Jaber. I tried to call you but haven't heard back yet. There's a deal. If you close it, you'll get 500 dinars and not a penny more. The client will be waiting at the showroom at 8. Don't be late. Yes, Mom. Studying- I don't know. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Hush him up or go somewhere else so I can hear. Yes, much better. I was alone, he wasn't home. He went to see a friend. Fouad, maybe. No, I'm not going to say anything. He should know by himself. Don't say anything, OK? Thank you for making coffee. You still haven't finished the book? I have but I'm just reviewing. Where do they sell bike wheels? ...the Jordanian parliament didn't agree to vote on the investigation committee's decision that accuses Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit of corruption by licensing the casino project in Jordan. The parliament session witnessed a verbal argument followed by scuffles between members of the parliament after clearing the Prime Minister from any accusation that needs the approval of two-thirds of the members. Meanwhile, the parliament did validate the charge of corruption of the former minister of tourism. We've got two brands for this model. A Chinese one for 7 dinars, and an Italian for 25 dinars. Unfortunately, we're out of the Chinese one. Well, bring us the Italian. - Sure. Imad, I'm leaving the country. Dad, the school principle wants to see you. What did you do? - Nothing. So what does he want? I don't know. Tell him I'm busy. He said that if he doesn't see you he won't let me take the exam. Take the first right and then the second street on your left. The electricity at my place got cut off. Can I charge my phone here? Don't look at your watch the client postponed the appointment. And you don't have a cell phone. You should know that we've showed her the car already. But she's still not convinced. Be careful, she's got a dirty mouth especially when it comes to men. Do you know her? She might become my mother-in-law. But don't mention it. She doesn't know yet the showroom is ours. Why? I don't want her to get greedy. So which car does she want to buy. The Toyota Jeep. And which car would you like her to buy? - The Range Rover. So how is this car? It's your call ma'am. But if you want to hear my honest opinion, I recommend the Range Rover. Why's that? It's got more room, it's true that it's two years older... but I guarantee you that in three years you wouldn't have to change a single part. I want the Range. And how's this car when it comes to steep roads. It's a fine. But the options the Range Rover has are better for all roads. Whether you drive around town or outside, off-road, hills, mountains. Slow down ma'am. Slowly. - Okay. By the way, the Range Rover has lights on the outside mirrors. When a car gets too close the lights turn red with an alarm tone. So you drive in full control and vision. Also ma'am, here you'd have buttons to control almost everything in the car. Stereo levels, the dvd player, speed and cruise control. Are you talking about this car or the Range Rover? To be clear with you ma'am, that Range Rover was ordered specifically for a client that couldn't fully pay its price. That's why it has all those special additions that you won't find in any other car. Have you got any grandchildren ma'am. I'm sorry. The reason I asked was to tell you about the special feature the Range Rover has that no other car does. You can separate the front seat from the back seat. With one click, right from the steering over there. A glass barrier would appear here. You won't hear a single thing. And from over here ma'am there's a sound recorder of whatever goes on in the back. Be careful ma'am... give me the phone. If you want to be with me the way I want then fine... If not, stay at home with your father the doctor. By the way ma'am, the mirror. When are you going to understand that all men are the same? You just don't listen, do you? Now he wants you to do things his way. You've always been this stubborn. You deserve it... Now he wants you to do things his way and if you want to stoop to his level, it's your own fault. By the way, ma'am, the Range Rover has a very special advantage. It's got this calm reaction, you would hardly feel these small jumps we're feeling right now. Whose signature is this? When you don't go to school, where do you go? I'm asking you. You were absent for 17 days. Where do you go? Read. What's that? I can't hear you. She... makes the things... I'm sorry the cab broke down and I couldn't give you a ride. Don't worry about it. I was having a bad day anyway. Why, what happened? My fianc?. I've been trying for 3 months to tell him that it's not working out and he's not getting it. Me too, I just got out of a relationship that has been suffocating me for the past 5 years. Now seriously, isn't the engagement period the time when you decide if someone is right for you or not. Of course. I feel like there's something wrong. This isn't the person that I want to spend my life with. Ever since we got engaged, I'm not allowed to go outwith my girlfriends without his permission. I'm not allowed to talk to the neighbours or even open the door if he isn't around. I'm sick of it. The best thing to do is to ignore him. Eventually he'll get it. I don't think so. I've been trying that for the last 3 months. That's him knocking on the door. Who? My fianc?. Who else have I been talking about? What is he doing here? I told him a hundred times not to come without calling first. Where is the extra electrical plug you told me about? No, this is not Youssef. Who's this? Man, how many times did I tell you not to give my number out? It's the accountant from the hospital. Yes p Yes, it's ready. Sorry for being a bit late. So when does the cashier close? Don't worry, I'll be there before that. What do you mean I'll lose my appointment? I said I'll be there in a bit. Wow, you were able to get 500 Dinars that quickly! I sold a jeep for 120 thousand dinars. After it was sitting there getting old for 6 months. I'm sure they'll take me back after this. I feel like things are getting better. I can feel it. That's good. How's Imad? Imad doesn't know how to read. So why don't you go see Dalal and sort it out? Didn't you say a year ago that you wouldn't really care if you see her. Or maybe you're afraid of getting weak like you used to during college days. Enough man! It's been 5 years. After this surgery, you should start a new life. Don't forget that you're still free. Unlike me. I've been married twice already and not once did my heart skip a beat. Where have you been all this time? You don't want to buy a cell phone? Congratulations on the garden. It's really nice. Are you here to congratulate me on the garden? No. I'm not here for that. Imad is... Yes, my love. No, he's still working on it, but I told him. He's playing. Imad's father is here. No, no. Don't worry I'm ready. The minute you get home we'll leave. OK, bye. Imad wants a dog for his birthday this year. Do you want share the cost? How much is it? 500 dinars. What kind of a dog costs 500 dinars? That's the price, do you want to help or not? I don't have the money. Of course, you don't. Dalal, don't talk to me like that. Do you have the time to raise the boy? Are you coming here to place blame? Your son has failed 6 subjects. How many times have I said we should put him in a private school... I've told you a thousand times, a stranger is not paying for my son! Understood? As you like, you are free to decide. But if I ever hear that you took Imad to a single one of your poker games... it will be the last time you see him. Dalal, have you forgotten how I bought you the apartment? And have you forgotten how you lost everything? Dalal, I didn't come here to get upset and fight. And I'm not here to blame anyone. My only concern now is my son's future. Are you okay? - It's nothing. What's this? This is the money I've been saving for his university. Youssef, what's wrong? Sit down. Do you need a doctor? - No I don't No need. Tomorrow, I have a small surgery. Why didn't you say anything? Put him in a private school nearby. With the money left, hire a private teacher. To teach him how to read so he can go to high school. Here is 200 dinars. And these are the 300 dinars of fines from last year. Now we're even. The youth of Egypt, are very precise and the country depends on them to make its future and not accepting to be infiltrated with those who seek to spread chaos looting public and private property, arson and causing destruction of the country. My conviction is unshakable, to continue with the political, social and economical reformation for a better Egyptian society free and democratic society, embracing the best values. I took the side of the poor people in our country convinced that the economy is the largest and most dangerous to be left to economists only and was keen to set into action the government's policies of economic reform. Hi, my son.. how are you? No... it's not my number. It doesn't matter now whose number it is. Did you study? What time is your exam? I'm traveling, my son, as I told you. I need you to take care of yourself. And your mother, of course. Don't make any trouble for her... listen to her - every word she says. Otherwise I'll be upset with you.
