Anything for us today? - No, no, Master Peter. - Oh, there must be something. Here, here you go, young rascal. [ Laughing ] There. This is the last mail I deliver anyhow. - What? - Tomorrow I change uniforms. - You're going in the army? - Yes, I was called. I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know. I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months. - It will, though. - I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer. [ Shouting, Chattering Continue ] ♪ [ Band Playing ] -♪ [ Continues ] - [ Shouting Continues ] [ Speaking, Inaudible ] ...defending our country, our fatherland. Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do: Strike with all our power. Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year. It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again. You are the life of the fatherland, you boys. You are the iron men of Germany. You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so. It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads. I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass. But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride. Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away. Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you? Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth? And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy? Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run? And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of? I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes. That has not been part of my teaching. We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would. But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised. I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses. But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land.: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori." "Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. " Some of you may have ambitions. I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters. And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will. But now our country calls. The fatherland needs leaders. Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country. Here is a glorious beginning to your lives. The field of honour calls you. Why are we here? You, Kropp, what has kept you back? You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed? Ah, I see you look at your leader.

What have we got to go back to? - School? - Why not? You know everything already. A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs. - You can't peel that off easily. - They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed. What can happen to us afterwards? I'll tell ya. Take our class. Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead... Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse. We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it. [ Man Shouting ] Hurry up! Get in there! Hurry up! Himmelstoss! [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing Continues ] - What's up? - What are you, crazy? - It's Himmelstoss! Himmelstoss? There is justice in the army! Well, well. So, we are all here, huh? - A bit longer than you, Himmie. - Since when have we become so familiar? Stand up and click your heels together! All of you! - Take a running jump at yourself! [ Laughs ] - Who's your friend? Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair? - [ Laughing ] - I command you as your superior officer! - Do you want to be court-martialled? - I do! There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it. - [ Laughing ] - Will you obey my orders? Kiss my butt! It isn't customary to ask for salutes here. But I'll tell you what we'll do. We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before. Many killed and many wounded. It was great fun. This time you're going with us. If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly... -"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?" - You'll-- You'll pay for this, you-- [ Distant Explosion ] - There it is. - [ Explosions Continue ] Right on time. Better get ready, boys. [ Explosions Continue ] [ Blows Whistle ] [ Shells Whistling ] [ Whimpering ] I'm wounded! I'm wounded! It's just a scratch, you yellow rat! Up!

[ Indistinct ] Oh, no. You won't die. Oh, no. You won't die. They're only little wounds. You'll get home. You'll be all right. You'll get home long before I will. [ Explosions, Gunfire Continue ] You know I can't run away. That's why you accuse me. I tell you, I didn't want to kill you. I tried to keep you alive. If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it. When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you. But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you. Forgive me, comrade. Say that for me. Say you forgive me. Oh, no. You're dead. You're better off than I am. You're through. They can't do any more to you now. Oh, God, why did they do this to us? We only wanted to live, you and l. Why should they send us out to fight each other? If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert. You'll have to forgive me, comrade. I'll do all I can. I'll write to your parents. I'll write to-- I'll write to your wife. I'll write to her. I promise she'll not want for anything. I'll help her and your parents too. Only forgive me. Forgive me! [ Sobbing ] Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Terrible thing happened yesterday. I stabbed a man. With my own hands, stabbed him. I know how it is. Your first time. Never mind. The stretcher-bearers will find him. - He's dead. I watched him die. - You couldn't do anything about it. We have to kill. We can't help it. That's what we are here for. Uh-- Look there, for instance. - [ Fires ] - Hah! That got him. You should've seen how he leaped in the air. That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits. If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening. Don't you lose any more sleep over this business. Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh? Sure, that's it. After all, war is war. [ Fires ] ♪ [ Soldiers Singing In German ] [ Man #1 ] March! Forward! Forward, march! [ Man #2 ] Quick there! Forward! [ Man #1 ] Company... halt! Dismissed!

No, that'd make her older than us. She's... 17. A girl like that. That'd be good, eh, Albert? We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around. - We could take a bath, wash our clothes-- - All right. and I might even go so far as to get deloused. Wait a minute!

[ Wheezing Laughter ] I'm Hamacher. Yeah, that's my name. I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating... "Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions." And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time. I hope you boys are not too badly wounded. [ Laughing ] The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted. You'll get to know us... very well. Thank you. You too. I'm sorry, my dear. It's time to go now. Yes, sister. Watch. If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him. - See? They're taking him to the dying room. - Dying room? When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed. In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue! [ Laughs ] It's so convenient. It saves a lot of trouble. But suppose he gets well? I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back. [ Quietly ] Sister. Sister. Sister. - [ Albert ] Is that you ringing, Paul? - Yes. - [ Hamacher ] Is something going on? - I think I have a haemorrhage. The bandage is all wet. I've been ringing forever and nobody comes. - I think I'm bleeding. - Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack. - Why didn't someone call me? - [ Albert ] He's been ringing. [ Hamacher ] Nobody can walk, Sister. - [ Albert ] Sister, is it bad? - No. No, we'll be all right. We've got it in time. [ Paul Whimpering ] What's the matter? What are you doing? We must rearrange your bandages. Wh-- Where are you taking me? To the bandaging ward. - No, no! I'm not going! I'm staying here! - [ Albert ] Paul!

I won't die! I'll come back! I won't die! I'm not going to die! I'll come back! [ Hamacher ] Sister Libertine, how is he? Poor boy. They had to amputate his leg. Paul. Paul. Paul. Oh, he is... gone. Gone. Hello. Welcome home, Albert! - How do you feel, kid? - All right. But I've got such an awful pain. My foot hur-- Hamacher. Did they cut my leg off? Of course not! How many did you have? Two? You still got 'em! One, two! [ Laughs ] Don't play the fool, Hamacher. Tell me truthfully. Of course not. And you look fine. Look. See? - [ Gasps ] I won't be a cripple. - Now, now. - I won't live like that! - Be calm. - I'll kill myself the first chance I get! - Albert! - I won't live! I won't live! - Yes, you will. Albert!

Everything will be all right... now. [ Bell Ringing ] Oh! Paul! Paul! Paul. - What's the matter, Paul? - Nothing. Nothing. Paul. Give me your handkerchief. - Mother? - [ Woman ] Here I am, Paul. Here I am. Mother's ill. - Are you wounded? - No, Mother. I got leave. [ Relieved Sigh ] [ Sobbing ] Here I am cryin' instead of being glad. Anna, get down the jar of blackberries. You still like them, don't you? Yes, Mother. I haven't had any for a long time. We might almost have known you were coming. - I'm making potato cakes. - [ Mother ] Don't let them burn. Paul... sit down... beside me. My Paul. My baby. I almost forgot, Mother. I've got some little presents for you. Look, Mother. Bread, sausage and rice. - Paul, you've been starving yourself. - Hmm-mm. Hadn't I better go and tell Father PauI's home? - Paul could watch the things on the stove. - No, I'm getting up. Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you? But somehow, I don't seem to know you. I'll take these off, Mother. I'll get your suit. It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it. Are you really here, Paul? You won't-- You won't disappear, will you? No. I'm here. Your things are ready for you, Paul. - I remember when you caught that one. - Yes. And you took it away from me, didn't you? - [ Giggles ] - Yes, I did. We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death. Gentlemen, my son. - Prosit. - Prosit. I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you. How are things out there? Terrible, eh? Terrible. But we must carry on. After all, you do at least get decent food out there. Naturally, it's worse here. Naturally. But the best for our soldiers all the time. That's our motto. - The best for our soldiers. - [ Murmurs Of Agreement ] But... [ Chuckles ] - you must give the Frenchies a good licking! - [ All Laughing ] And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home. Give us a hand there, men. Now, then, there's the line. Runs so, in a "V". Here is St Quentin. You can see for yourself. You're almost through now. All right? Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare! Smash through the johnnies! And then you will have peace. When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here. Oh! You don't know anything about it. Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole! You can't judge that. Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life. But for that, you receive the highest honour. I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross. First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders. - On to Paris! Push on to Paris! - Right. No, not in Flanders. I'll tell you just where the break should come. - Here. - The enemy has too many reserves there. - I insist upon Flanders! - Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already? Because Flanders is a flat country! - No mountains, no obstructions! - There's too many rivers there! [ Professor ] From the farms they have gone; from the schools, from the factories. They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland. Paul! How are you, Paul? Glad to see you, Professor. You've come at the right moment, Baumer! Just at the right moment. And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go. A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war; one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field. Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed. The kind of soldier every one of you should envy. Oh, lad, you must speak to them. You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland. - No, I can't tell them anything. - You must, Paul. Just a word.Just tell them how much they're needed out there. Tell them why you went and what it meant to you. I can't say anything. You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility. - Tell about it. - [ Enthusiastic Chattering ] I can't tell you anything you don't know. We live in the trenches out there. We fight. We try not to be killed; sometimes we are. That's all. [ Professor ] No. No, Paul. I've been there! I know what it's like. That's not what one dwells on, Paul. I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes. You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you? We used to think you knew. The first bombardment taught us better. It's dirty and painful to die for your country. When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all! There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it? - [ All Chattering ] - [ Professor ] Paul! You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there. He tells you, "Go out and die." Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it. - [ Boy ] Coward! - And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen. - [ Angry Clamouring ] - [ Professor ] No! No! Boys, boys! - I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say-- - It's no use talking like this. You won't know what I mean. Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom. So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time. Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week! I shouldn't have come on leave. Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all! You can't fool anybody about that very long. Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive. Three years we've had of it-- four years. Every day a year and every night a century. Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death. We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you! I shouldn't have come on leave. I'll go back tomorrow. I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here! I'll go back tomorrow! Sorry. Mother, you'll catch cold here. You must go to sleep. There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone. Must you go tomorrow, Paul? Must you? Yes, Mother. Orders were changed. Are you very much afraid, Paul? No, Mother. There's something I want to say to you, Paul. It's-- Just be on your guard against the women out there. They're no good. Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother. Be very careful at the front, Paul. Yes, Mother, I will. I'll pray for you every day. And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous. Yes, Mother. I'll try and get in the cookhouse. - That can easily be done. - You do it then, and if the others say anything-- That won't worry me, Mother. Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back. I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack. They'll keep you nice and warm. [ Choking ] They're all wool. That's sweet of you. Goodnight... my son. Goodnight, Mother. Oh, Mother, Mother. You still think I'm a child. Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry? - Is this the 2nd Company? - Yes, sir. ♪ [ Concertina ] ♪ [ Whistling ] - Is this all of it? - Yes, sir. We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday. But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again. How old are you? Sixteen. No use. I couldn't find anything. - We'll have to eat the sawdust. - [ Discontented Grumbles ] Not me! I'll go hungry first. It makes me sick. Now it's gonna be a real war again. Paul! How's old Paul? Here I am. You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find. Nobody seemed to know where you were. I'm glad you found it. I guess I don't get much of this. There used to be some food in the sawdust. Now it's all sawdust. No joke, either. Eats ya up inside. This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company. The replacements are all like that. Not even old enough to carry a pack. All they know how to do is die. I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet. Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now. Where's Westhus? Messenger dog was wounded. He went out to get it. [ Clucks Tongue ] - Is it true about the armistice? - Doesn't look that way back there. - You mean they want us to go on fighting? - That's what they say. They're crazy! Germany'll be empty pretty soon. Where is-- Where is Detering? He got homesick. You remember about the cherry blossoms? I guess he never got over that. He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm. They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since. He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way. - Where's Kat? Is he-- - [ Chuckles ] Not Kat! If he were out, the war would be over. You remember what he always says: They're savin' him for the last. - Where is he? - He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with. - Which way? - Down the road about two miles that way. I'll see you later. Kat! Paul! Hello, Paul. - How's the side? - Oh, it's all right now. It's fine. - Have any luck? - No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake. [ Chuckles ] Let's sit down there. Tell me, Paul... how was it at home? Have a good leave? - In spots. - What's the matter? Ohh... I'm no good for back there any more, Kat. None of us are. We've been in this too long. The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country. The old men said, "Go on. Push on to Paris." My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him. It's not home back there any more. All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again." You're all I've got left, Kat. I'm not much to have left. I missed you, Paul. At least we know what it's all about out here. There're no lies here. Push on to Paris? You ought to see what they've got on the other side. They eat white bread over there. They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything. What've we got left? Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men. No food, no ammunition, no officers. Push on to Paris! So that's the way they talk back there. [ Chuckles ] I guess we'd better be going. How I lied to my poor mother. I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together. Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth. Down! That's another one that missed us. Come on. Let's go. Wait a minute. Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down. - I guess I don't walk the rest of the way. - Did that get ya, Kat? Aah, I think it broke my shin. That's not so bad. Hold it together. -Just my luck, huh? - Good luck. That means the war is over. Oh, no, sir! This war don't end till they really get me. - [ Chuckles ] - Now this one-- - Aah. - Easy, now. - Hey! - Easy! Easy! Come on. I'll take you in. Give me your hand. Easy. [ Grunts ] All right. Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated. Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over. - Yes, kid. - You give me your address, I'll give you mine. You can't get both of us in one day. Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat. Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory? And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells? And my first bombardment. How I cried. I was a young recruit then. Here we are. Here we are. [ Grunts ] All right now, Kat. You could've spared yourself the trouble. He's dead. Oh, no. He's just fainted. He was hit in the shin. He's dead. Would you like to take his pay book? - You're not related, are you? - No, we're not related. Your deal. Get his name and number? Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
