Father! Come quickly. What is it? A body fell from the sky. It went into the water behind the hill. They have come again to our land. We will not tolerate outsiders! They must all be killed. No exceptions! Stop! We can't be rash. You dare stand against me? You know your place. Death to outsider! No! Stop! Look how many of us have died. You are not fit to lead us. I have kept us alive. I have done what is necessary. Not all appove of your methods. You follow or die! Kill her! Keep quiet. I don't want to hurt you! Father. Come on out. It's all right. You are such a brave strong girl. They killed so many Father. I didn't know how to help. I wanted to. I stayed hidden like you taught me. You are alive. That is what is important. You must be starving. Are you willing to sacrifice your daughter's life for the outsiders? The woman brought me to Nidal. - She saved her life. - You know the code... All outsiders must die. This is the way it has always been. No exceptions. The code is wrong. I will not have you put our tribe in danger. They will die today. It's your choice if you wish to join them. Your foolishness... Will kill us all! Will you lower your weapons of war? Let us go in peace to our homes. The Vessels are returning. There is hope.
