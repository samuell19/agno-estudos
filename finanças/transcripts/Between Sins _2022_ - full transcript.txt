(gentle piano music) (wind howling) - [Coy] My mom had this huge rock bed growing up. Weeds would grow all crazy through the cracks turn everything all ugly, you know? (gunshots firing) - Muck City style baby, huh. (helicopter thrumming) - [Coy] Now, Moms wouldn't let me use the chemicals on the garden weeds. I had to pick those by hand, but on that rock bed, she'll let me have at it with those chemicals. I still remember the first week I sprayed the weeds. Nothing really happened. The weeds popped right back up. The following week, same thing. But after awhile, I noticed, the weeds were barely growing, if at all. At first I was happy. I felt like they went on to somebody else's yard to torture, you know? - [Man] Hah! Oh! Oh! - [Coy] But I think that's when it hit me. It wasn't that they didn't wanna grow, (police sirens wailing) it was that they couldn't grow. I poisoned the ground. And that's what it always felt like in my hood, you know? A whole bunch of poison, dumped on our heads, saturating the ground for generations. And they wonder why we still can't grow. (buzzer buzzes) (cell door rumbles) (airplane engine roaring distantly) - Oh, there go my favorite girl. How you doing, Ma? - Hey, Coy. - You ok? Mwah! Doctors told you it was okay for you to be driving on these meds, Ma? - No, but I'd rather it'd be me picking you up and not that boy. When was the last time you talked to him? - Three, four years maybe. - So, the whole time? - I mean, he looked out for me a couple times. - And you took it? - I was hurting in there, I, Ma, you swervin'. - I know what I'm doin'! - You swervin', Ma! Ma, pull over the car. Pull over the car, Ma. Pull over right here. Right here, you good, you good. - Mm-hmm. - Let me drive ma. - The medicines make my hands stiff. - That's all the more reason why you- (Gloria coughs hard) Ma, you okay? - Mm-hmm. - That's all the more reason you shouldn't be driving. Look what we got over here. Look. - Hey what? - [Coy] Still here. - Barely. - I remember that book. Remember we used to go on those church retreats, me, you, and Pop? And y'all used to make me learn whole scriptures by the time we'd get to the destination. - We had to occupy you somehow. To keep you from driving us crazy. - Why, by making me carsick? Learning all those chapters like that. - It worked. (both laughing) - I hope this is the last time, Coy. I'm getting old. - It is, Mom.

Man, it's crazy. - Look what she get it from. Hell, she eating up everything in the house. - [Coy] So, is it okay for me to get a hug? Stop acting like that, man. - Dang! Coy, put me down! Stop playin'. - I hope you ain't bringing any kinda niggas around our door seeing all your little business like that. - Don't do that. Don't do that, don't do that. 'Cause if you was doing what you supposed to be doing, that wouldn't even be a issue. - So how much time I got with her? - I'll give you a few extra days, Coy, since you just getting home.

(light piano music) - [News Announcer] Former police officer charged in the death of Corey Jones has tried to get those charges dropped by using Florida's stand your ground defense. He was in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm, When he shot Mr. Corey Jones. - Corey Jones' car had broken down on the side of the road in Palm Beach Gardens in October 2015. He was on the phone with roadside assistance when Nouman Raja approached, but Raja was in plain clothes driving an unmarked van and had no badge or radio. - You good? - I'm good. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm good. - Yeah? - Yeah. (bleep) - Gun! (gunshots firing) - [News Announcer] Raja claims he did ID himself and in the end, fired six shots killing the church drummer. - Damn Corey no! - I'm not gonna lie to you, these are difficult days. Difficult days even for me. We do not act in times of fear. Our God is not a God of fear. Our God is not a God of confusion. - [Congregation] Amen. - Our God is a God of righteousness.

And I heard the brothers saying, you know, sometimes men can be macho and, you know, try to hold their feelings in, but it's very important for us to have somebody to talk to. - [Man] Yes, sir. - You know, we're going back to our scripture of topic that we found the iron men on, Proverbs 27:17, that tells us that iron sharpens iron. - [Man] What you say. - So does a man sharpens the countenance of his friend, so that's what, that's how we got iron men. So, it's nice to know that you got a brother that you can talk to. - [Man] What you say. (dog barking distantly) - Coy! - Oh you look magnificent. Look at you.

Come on, come on, come on. I was finishing up anyhow. - All right. - Sit down, sit down, Sit down, have a seat. - I see you reading the good book. What church you go to? - Oh man, I just kinda jump from church to church, you know? Trying to learn all the perspectives and get the views, see if they match the ones that I had when I had my church. - You had a church? - I had a little storefront church. Um, about 10, handful of folk, but boy, we had some church up in there. - So what happened to it? - Eh, Coy. You really wanna know? - Yeah. - Truthfully, I let it go. I guess because I was scared. - Scared of what? - I don't know. It not growing, wouldn't provide enough income for my family. - I understand that. - I could feed them. - Yeah. - Uh, (laughs) afraid that there'd be some pretty young thing sitting up there with a skirt all the way up there to her thighs. (both laughing) You know what I'm talking about. - Yeah. - My name would be dirt. I didn't realize, Coy, I had more excuses than I had faith. - Sound a little bit like Gideon to me. - (laughs) What you know about Gideon? (both laughing) - You know, man, I know a little something, something. - Coy, you know, the boys and I, we usually have a little get together, you know? We discuss some things, we talk and we support each other. You know, iron sharpen iron. As people sharpen people, you know what I'm talking about? - Yeah, I get it. I mean, if that's a invite, I don't mind. I'll... I'll check it out. - You should. - Yeah. - You should and, uh, maybe one day I'll come to your church. - Yeah, yeah, maybe you should. (both laughing) - A killing that is excusable or was committed by the use of justifiable deadly force is lawful. If you find Corey Jones was killed by Nouman Raja, you will then consider the circumstances surrounding the killing in deciding if the killing was manslaughter or whether the killing was excusable, or resulted from justifiable use of deadly force. - Nouman Raja's not guilty and he should be found not guilty, and that doesn't mean that this isn't the saddest thing that could ever have possibly happened. It's horrible but that doesn't make it a crime. - The last three shots are so deliberate, and so methodical. It's as though he's just at the range... practicing, or he's hunting, you know? He's lining up his sight. Boom. (gunshot fires) Boom. (gunshot fires) Boom. (gunshot fires) Now if none of those three hit him, then guess what? Because if he had sustained, if he sustained all three shots in the first set of three, those last three, attempted first degree murder. (somber instrumental music) (wind howling) (car rumbles) - Hey. - Hey. - All right, let's do it, little girl. All right? - Mm-hmm. - Hey, Skylar, what's up? - Hey. - Well, Im'ma a see you later, right? - You ain't gonna see her later, partner. What you talkin' 'bout. - Chores first. - Hey, you keep saying you got a man, but I ain't seen him yet, and I asked Skylar about him, and she don't know nothing about him either. - Maybe I'm just trying to keep him away from you. - Hmm, really? Maybe he don't exist. I seen a football player or something like that do that once or something. - Coy, whether he exists or not, it's none of your business. - Why you gotta act like that? Huh? One dinner, that's all I'm asking you. Just once chance to talk, that's it. - Just relax a little bit. Give me, give me some time. Let me get myself together. Let me go in here, clean up a little bit. Coy?

You gotta, you gotta get out there, man. - That's smart. You need to tell your homeboy the same thing. - My homeboy, who that? - Pudda.

You know, he just stepping in people way out here, you know, trying to get him some money. But you know how that go. Ain't no problem though.

Life, if you just... pay your bills on time... treat people right... (laughs) and learn how to cook for yourself, you'll be all right. (Coy laughs) - I guess so. - Which one of those you think I got right Coy? (Pudda laughs) Take this in the delivery room. - Oh, it's like one of them little mask things. - Yeah, something like that. - Yeah. - Make sure you put it on, man. Don't let 'em get what we got. - Ma, you all right in there? - I'm fine. - Temperature still good? - Perfect. - All right, ma. - I'm ready.

All right, ball in, let's go! What you gonna do? What you gonna do? - I won. (laughs) he really thought he was gonna win. - You got it. - You can't beat me! (both laughing) - You got it, good game. Good game, Jazmine. But you better not be talking about who you gonna meet. Who's that little boy on the bicycle anyway? (laughs) Who is that? Anyway, you tell him he can't be calling you. Ain't none of that, you know I don't play. - Oh. - Yeah, oh. (light piano music) - If you had cooked like when we was together, I'd probably would have still been around. (laughs) - I don't know, Ang. I think it would've took a little bit more than a home cooked meal to keep you around. I had too much shit going on back then, you know? - You said it, not me. - What about now? - You didn't think a little chicken and pasta was gonna woo me did you? - No, but it shows I'm putting forth effort, I guess. - Well, try with some other chick who don't know you like I know you. - Ang what's that suppose to mean. - You don't have a clue as to why I left, do you? - I told you to leave. - You only told me to leave 'cause you knew I had done checked out anyway. Don't try to act like you was doing me a favor now, Coy. (Coy sighs) - All right then, Angela. Why did you leave? - Junebug, Mike Mike. You don't remember that, do you? Hell, after the fourth or fifth one, I was wondering if you was next. And I just was not about to be... the next chick... burying a dude because of the streets. - Wow, I mean, I'm Catholic, but there's no way I'd be able to snooze off in here. - [Church Member] Not that easy. - No it's not. As you may or may not know, I am running for county commissioner. - We heard about you. - Mm-hmm. I set up my offices right down the street, right in this very community because I wanted to be closer to the people who I am vying to serve. Now, I truly believe that this community has been let down by its government. - We're listening. (audience clapping) - Good, I hope you are. You know since, since we are in a church today, let me give you a little biblical example, if you will allow me. - Be careful now. - Okay. (laughs) Now, in the bible during his sermon on the mount, Jesus told his followers that if a soldier was required to carry his equipment for one mile that he should carry it for two. All right, now we call that going the extra mile. Let me tell my brothers and sisters something here today. I will go that extra mile for you. The healing of this country starts in the communities that we live, work and play in every day. - Right. - Mm-hmm. If you give me your vote at the polls, I promise to work for a better future for every citizen in this county. - What about the shootings? - And Corey Jones? Will he be given justice? Or just be another statistic? - [Audience Member] Come on now. (Hip Hop Music Playing) - You got a job for me? - I got something for you in the car. - Yeah? - What's up, y'all boys?

All us gotta coincide. It ain't no use of you hating. Ain't nan' race gonna disappear. - We continue to prove them right because all we do is put up a fight against each other. I see black on black crime each day, a brother fighting a brother. A sister fighting a sister, a brother kills a sister and a sister kills a brother each day. But how 'bout we stop killing each other as a race and stop giving these people what they want to see and kill this reputation. But I just wanted to say that we need to show the world that we all aren't thugs and on the blocks selling rocks, we actually are achieving and leading the way. - Say his name! - [Crowd] Corey Jones! - Say his name! - [Crowd] Corey Jones! - Say his name! - [Crowd] Corey Jones! - [Woman On Megaphone] Say his name! - [Crowd] Corey Jones! - [Woman On Megaphone] Say his name! - [Crowd] Corey Jones! - Aye? - What up? - You remember when we was young, and we stole them bicycles? - You mean bike.

Nigga, beat me home. - Nah, I looked over my shoulder, I seen buddy with the blade. Brought the Usain Bolt out my motherfuckin' ass. I was outta there. - Blade, nigga? - Yeah, it was. - It was the ass whoopin. The ass whoppin' that your people was gonna put on your ass, nigga, if you got caught.

Fuck I got sympathy for them for, huh? - I mean, there's way more other people out there to think about man, like... All we ever did was take from the game, Pudda. (Pudda laughs) What you gave back to the game? Really though, I mean like, come on, think about it. What you ever gave back to the game? - That bible fucking your head up. Get rid of that shit, man. Throw that shit in the Atlantic Ocean or something. - Why is that, Pudda? - Why? - Yeah, why? - Cause them crackers gave that book to us to tame a nigga, That's why. Nigga, we kings and queens out here. Kings and queens. Nigga took the gold from the crown of our head, nigga, and put that shit in our mouth, nigga. Now every time we speak, it's king shit, nigga.

Can I help you with something? - I'm canvassing the neighborhood searching for leads on the homicide that took place last night. - Oh, um, yeah. I heard somebody got killed down there. Ya'll got a name for him or something like that? - We haven't released any names but he goes by the name Black. You know him? - No, ma'am, I, I don't know no Black. - Well, did you hear the shooting last night? - No, ma'am. - You sure about that? - Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty sure. - Over 15 rounds and you didn't hear anything? - Look, ma'am, I, I been living round here so long, it's like, um, it's like elevator music or something like that to me, you know what I mean? Like, like sometimes you hear it, sometimes you don't. - [Detective] Give me a call. - [Pastor] How's the job down there at the docks doing? - It's actually going good, man.

I'll talk to you later. - All right, Pastor. (Coy sighs) What up, P? What you doing here? I thought you was all anti-religious and all that? - I came to tell the pastor that Black got killed. - The pastor know Black? - Pastor Mayes knows everybody. - I'm sorry about what happened to Black though, man. This detective chick came by, like, asking questions, or like, looking for tips or something. - You heard anything? - Nah, I mean, I ain't heard nothing. You? - Nothing. When I find out who killed Black. He gotta go. Him and the next generation. Over 'wit. You with me?

If they killed Black... it ain't gonna be too long before they after me. Stay up, man. - You know, I can remember one time I was traveling, and, uh, it was a bad storm. I mean, it was storming, it was raining. I couldn't hardly see, but my mind said to keep going, because I'm gonna go out of that storm, but if I were to stop in that storm, then it would've, it would've beat me up. - [Man] Exactly. - I mean, sometimes you just got to keep going. You got to go through. - Exactly. - And I kept going, I kept going. About a mile down the road, it was sunny. I was out of that storm, and that's sometime we have to think, when we're going through the storm. We got to hold tight to God's unchanging hand. - Father, we just thank you for your grace. - Thank you. - Thank you, Jesus. - For your mercy. - Thank you. - We thank you, Father, for these brethern that are accountable to each other. - [Group] Oh, yes. - [Man] Father, we just pray that you unify our hearts. - [Group] Yes. - [Man] Unify us, strengthen us God as men, that we'll be who you called us to be oh God. - [Group] Oh, yes. - And to each one, that is here tonight, when you coming back next, for the next meeting, bring someone with you. - [Group] Amen, Amen. (group clapping) (birds chirping) - [Coy] Mom, how much time you got? - The doctor said ain't no point in taking medication no more. He said I might as well just enjoy the time I got left without being sick from medication on top of being sick already. But whose report shall we believe? Hmm? - We shall believe the report of the Lord. - Right. (laughs) The doctor ain't my God. (birds chirping) Coy, you going a little bit too fast. Slow down! Coy, did you hear me? You need to slow down! This is dangerous! Coy, stop this damn chair right now! Boy, you stop it! (Gloria laughing loudly) - Ma, you were scared, Ma! (both laughing) You were scared, weren't you? (both laughing) I just wanted to give you a little bit of life, Ma. (Gloria laughing) I don't want you feeling all sad worrying about this. - [Gloria] Oh! - Oh man, you should've seen the look on your face. (Gloria laughing) - I was holding on too, wasn't I? - I see you. (Gloria laughing) - You gripped that handle so tight. - Oh, yes I did! (both laughing) 25 something years since I be cussin' and now you got me doing that right before I'm about to die! - [Coy] Pops should've seen that, Ma. - [Gloria] Oh, my goodness. He would've laughed so hard. (laughs) (light piano music) (wind howling) (Gloria sighs) - Hey, Ma. - Hey, Coy. - [Coy] You okay? - Yeah, I was about to read some of my scriptures, but my eyes getting so bad. Come on and read it. Read 'em for me. Come on. - Okay. (light piano music) What you want me to read? - Isaiah 40. Somewhere near the bottom. (Coy sighs) - Isaiah 40. - Mm-hmm. Got it? - Yes, ma'am, right here. All right, um, "The Lord is the everlasting God. "The creator of the ends of the earth. "He will not grow tired or weary. "And his understanding, no one can fathom. "He gives strength to the weak. "He gives strength to the weary "and increases the power of the weak. "Even youths grow tired and weary "and young men stumble and fall. "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. "They will soar on wings like eagles. "They will run and not grow weary. "They will walk and not be faint." (Gloria sighs) Goodnight mama. - Goodnight. (light piano music) (Gloria sighs) (dog panting) - [Coy] You got everything you need, right? - Yeah. - They're in my other classes. (student laughs) - [Student] You usually meet people at the orientation. - No, I'm talking about at Duncan. (students chattering) - I heard a lot about him. He plays football. - You going to practice today, ain't you? - [Skylar] Yeah. - All right, I'm gonna make sure. - [Skylar] Mm-hmm. - I love you. Oh, you don't want to be seen with your dad, huh? (students chattering) (car rumbling) (seagulls squawking) - [Randy] Yo, Coy? Coy! - [Coy] Yo, what's up Randy? - I need you to drop everything Right now, man. It's urgent. I need you to come over here. - All right. - [Randy] Coy, I got a phone call. - All right. - It's not good. - What, you firing me or something, man? - No, man, not even. (sighs) Your mom just passed. We just got the news. I'm sorry. (somber instrumental music) (birds chirping) - My son, his last day of his life was something very profound, that when we lose our children, we can remember every second of that last day. - And you could remember what you said to him, where you were, and for me, I was home that morning. - And so, Oscar and his friends got on the BART train, and on the way back, he was shot and killed. - But you know what else we must realize We made plans, and God had has plans. - When Oscar was killed, my first response to God was, God, you said that we would be in ministry together? God, you said that we would minister, we'd go different places together. And I was really crying and having a pity party. And God spoke to me and told me, "Look around, you are in ministry together." - Don't wait until it happens to you. - [Audience Member] Amen. - Come together with your community now. We have to stop the violence and this is why we fight. - I also remember my phone call from Sabrina that day when we lost Corey. I was getting ready to sit and sit and have dinner with a friend of mine, and, um, she called and said that something had happened to Corey. I said, "What do you mean something happened to Corey?" "He's been shot." I said, "Who'd shoot Corey?" Corey? I'm thinking now, another cousin whose name is Corey. I said, "Maybe she's talking about Corey Banks." "Not Corey Jones." "Corey doesn't bother with anyone." And she called back and said, "Sabrina" she said yeah, "He's gone." And I, Immediately left the restaurant. In tears, I couldn't contain myself. Somebody say, "But God." - [Audience] But God. (somber instrumental music) (high heels clicking) (water splashing) - What's up? How you feel? - You know what, Pudda, seeing my mama in that box, man. Made me realize one thing today, man. - Yeah, what's that? - I couldn't live with myself if something happened to you out here in the streets, bro, and I knew something about it. And didn't say nothing about it. That was Varis and them who did that to Black, man. - Varis! I motherfuckin' knew it, nigga. Snake ass nigga. How long you knew, fam? - Same night, man. I ain't get a good look at the driver. But Varis was shooting. - He was shooting, huh? Who side you on, man? You wanna be on them niggas side? That's what you wanna do? Good, I run through all that shit, nigga! This shit chess not checkers, homie. Eat or get ate, nigga! You a clown, man. - I ain't tell you 'cause I knew what it was gonna mean, bro. - [Pudda] Man fuck that! - Pudda! Damn this nigga, man. (weapons clattering) Bro? - Yo, bro, calm down dawg. Calm down. - What's up? - Listen to me, dawg. - What the fuck you want, man? - I can't let you go out there by yourself like that. - I'm good by myself, nigga. - I know you good dawg. [Pudda] What the fuck you mean? - I'm going with you, bro. - I keep tabs on all my enemies, nigga. Know what I'm saying? Look, we're finna' go in there make this shit like the old days, my nigga.

You know what I'm saying? You ready? - Let's do it. Turn off the lights, let's go. - You ready? (dog barking distantly) (car doors slam) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbles) - [Alan Watts] You see, how it was done was this prohibition, not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. That was the one sure way (gunshots firing) of getting it eaten. But, of course, when the Lord God accused Adam and said "You've been eating of that tree I told you not to eat," and uh, he passed the buck to Eve and said, "This woman that thou gavest me, "she tempted me and I did eat." And he looked at Eve, "Now what about it?" She said, "Well, it was the serpent." He looked at the serpent. The serpent didn't say anything (Audience laughing) because he knew too much and he wasn't going to give away the show. (car doors open) (car doors slam) (light instrumental music) - Look on your lap, nigga. It's real money out here. I done told you that time after time. Get money, nigga. What you over there lookin' all sad and shit for? You act like that was your dog or something, man. - Nah, It wasn't my fucking dog, it was his dog, Pudda. - Nigga, fuck that mutt!

Look on your lap, nigga. - P, take this little bullshit ass little money, man. This little bullshit ass money, you think that's money? Take that little money. It make us even, right?

Matter of fact, since you fin' to go home, do me one more favor before you leave. - What's that, P? - And dawg, you can get up out this shit. - What's that, P? - [Pudda] Run this bag in there to one of my workers for me, man.

I'm working for the church. - What you doing? You working for this nigga? Talk about what?! - He's did it for the church, Coy. - I can explain everything. - My father was a founding member in this church. - Yes, I know that that's why I'm trying to do this! - He built this church with his own fucking hands! - That's what I'm trying to do! I'm trying to help the church, that's all I'm trying to do. Okay, Coy? - I want you to see who God is, nigga. - [Coy] It ain't you, nigga. - I ain't your motherfucking God? - You ain't my God, nigga. - Coy, please. - Fuck you think you is? - What the fuck you mean, I ain't your God, nigga?

Get the motherfuckin' money. (dog barking distantly) - [New Announcer] Breaking. Audio of Corey Jones killing just released. Be advised, this may disturb some. - [Maddie] Thank you for calling AT&T Roadside Assistance. This is Maddie.

Put your fuckin' hands up! [Corey] Hold on, hold on! - Get your fuckin' hands up! Gun! (gunshots firing) [Maddie] Oh my god. (somber piano music) (seagulls squawking) (light piano music) (boat engine rumbling) - [Skylar] Why did you steal the boat? - I ain't steal it, I borrowed it. We gonna bring it right back. What's up, you all right out there? Yeah? You don't look like it, smile or something. Hey, look, you see that bunker over there? That was built for President Kennedy. Just in case something happened out here and the whole world went up in flames. - Was it ever used? - Nah, I don't think so. But we still got time though. (laughs) (water splashing) Right over here, it's the rich people. Right across the water is the poor people. Don't nothing separate us but water. Turn right, turn right. All right, you got it? I got your gas, don't worry about that. Just turn right a little bit more. You got it. Based on your profession of faith, in accordance with the Lord's command, I baptize you Skylar McDonald in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, to be buried in the likeness of his death, and to be raised in the likeness of his resurrection. And also, to walk in the newness of life. (water splashing) (both laughing) (water splashing) (light piano music) (car rumbling) (birds chirping) - How you doing, Mama? - [Jury Member] We the jury find as follows. As to count one, we find the defendant guilty of manslaughter while armed with a firearm as charged in the information. As to count two, we find the defendant guilty of attempted first degree murder as charged in the information. - [News Announcer] Palm Beach Gardens police officer Nouman Raja's trial, it was found that he was guilty of manslaughter with a firearm, which is an offense punishable by up to 30 years in prison. Also guilty of attempted first degree murder, which could mean 25 years to life in prison. - Faith will cause us and have us with the ability that we can step out on the water. - [Audience Member] Yes. - Just like old patriarch Peter. He had just enough faith to be able to step out of the boat onto the water and walk. Are there any water walkers in the house tonight? (car rumbling) - Hey Coy! - B, what up? - [BJ] What's happening, Coy? - I'm chillin'. Eh, Skylar? Skylar? I'll see you inside, go in, all right? - Okay. - Boy, I ain't seen you in a minute, man. Since we first started protesting 'round here over the Corey Jones murder. - [Coy] Yeah, them was some crazy times, right? I just remember everybody being so angry, you know? Mad, especially y'all. Y'all was hot, cuzz. Y'all was ready to burn, loot, steal, everything. - It was wild, man, but to be honest with you, to burn down my own city, even if they would've let that cop off the hook, I just, I just couldn't do it, bro. - Why not? - And today, we are rejoicing. We are rejoicing for the victory, and I just want to take this time out to say we want to pray for the victim's family. - [Woman] Yes. - We know that they are hurt too. - I don't know, bro. I guess in the back of my mind, I'm thinking that if I burn it down, what they gonna replace it with? You see, we already ain't got nothing around here as it is now. And then, you know, we don't wanna see no nother liquor store around here, you know what I mean? - Nah, we definitely don't need another liquor store around this motherfucker, B. - You know, I ain't gonna hold you up. Im'ma let you get to church in. - Yeah, I need all the blessings I can get right now, man. - Yeah bro. - It was good to see you though, man. We gotta link up for real, man. - Most definitely, man. - All right. Hey, you hold it down. - One hundred, baby. - [BJ] True, true. (light piano music) - [Alan Watts] Who is it that sits at the left hand of God? We know who sits at the right hand. It's hushed up because that's the side where the district attorney sits, and in the Book of Job, of course, you know, Satan is the district attorney at the court of Heaven. He's the prosecutor. He's a faithful servant of the court, because you see, the whole problem is... it would be very bad indeed if God were the author of evil, and we were his victims. That is to say, if we keep the model of the King of the universe, and the creatures are all subjects of the King, then a God who is responsible for evil is being very unkind to other people. But in this theory, God is not another person. There are no victims of God. He is never anything but his own victim. You are responsible and if you want to stay in the state of illusion, stay in it. But you can always wake up. (light piano music)
