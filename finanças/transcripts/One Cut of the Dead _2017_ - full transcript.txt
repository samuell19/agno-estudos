Ken-Chan. Please. Stop. Ken-Chan. Ken-Chan. Look, it's me. Please. Wake up. I love you. Cut. Is that good? How many so far? This is the 42nd take. You are facing death. Yes. Did you feel it in your heart? Yes, I tried to express... No, to express is to fake. OK. Don't express it. Live it. OK, 'live it' you mean? I want real fear. I must read fear on your face... You know why you can't deliver? Because your whole life is fake. You liiiie your way through it. Take off your fake mask. Please Mr. director... Don't interrupt me, little twit. This is my work... it's my work. You dare nag me on my set? Stop, take a break, half an hour. Mr. Director could we take 30 minutes? I've never seem his that mad. I'll be outside taking a breath of fresh air. Are you okay? -I’m fine. Take care of her. Are you OK? That guy is crazy, he's scary. It's because I'm not up to the part. You were good, he doesn't make sense. I'll do it. You can help, just be more intense... come at me with all you've got. Can I see you tonight? I look forward to take a bath together. -Shhh. There you are. Sit down. Goodness. 42 takes, that's inhumane. I'm sorry. It's not you, this guy is a psycho. And it's a real axe, so dangerous. What? The director asked me to sprinkle blood on the roof. On the roof? What for? I don't know, maybe to make it rain on your heads. What? Is the director usually like that? He took it a notch further this time. This movie is particularly important. He's up to his ears in debt. For this movie? That's tough. I'm going to focus on my part. You need to relax. Sit down. You're dedicated. That's a great location. Perfect for the genre. The director visited hundreds of abandoned places in Japan. The atmosphere is absolutely creepy. That's because some real horror happened here. What? They're just rumors, urban legends, you guys see them on the net. Come, I'll tell you. This place... as a cover it was a water recycling plant. But actually, the Japanese army was conducting experiments. What experiments? -Human experiments. Human experiments? They were researching ways to resurrect the dead. Did they really... Who knows... But it doesn't stop at that. -There's more? Hey, it scared me. Good timing. Was it the wind? Tell me Nao-San... -Uhm? You have hobbies? Why do you ask that? We can have a lighter topic. Well, call that a hobby, I'm studying self-defense. Self-defense. Well, you see... I work a lot with young people like you. I love to teach them. Wow. Can you show us? Suppose I come at you like this. Ouch, ouch. It's great? -Amazing. And from the back. You come and catch me. OK, excuse me. There. Pom. You did it. -It’s amazing. And so you call this one 'Pom'? There are are many techniques. You did it skillfully. -It’s amazing. You scared me, what is this? Your makeup is quite good. You could be an actor. OK, we're done playing. Wait, what is it? Mr. Director... What? Uh? Well. Is that one of our props? So cool. Looks so real. -Right. Creepy. So perfect... what is this? Who asked you to do that? The Director? He's playing dead. I get it, it's supposed to be his arm. Really? OK guys, you really pranked us. Guys you can stop now. OK, good, stand up now. His arm is really bitten off. He is dead, really dead. No, no. Tell me... is he...? No way. It's impossible. I can't believe it. They don't exist. How is that... Don't... Mr. Director. What are you doing? Duh, I'm shooting. Don't you get the situation? Hey. That's a good movie. This isn't a movie, you're crazy. This is my movie and you're in it. You can't fake it anymore, this is the real deal, the real deal. And we keep rolling. The camera can't stop. That's impossible. I made it possible. Now the roof is sprinkled with blood. With blood? You did that. So the rumors are actually true. I don't understand what you are saying. Just a year ago in summer... a day so hot I couldn't breathe... I was at home writing a script. I read a strange account on a blog... Hey, where are you going? Just a... -Just what? Wait a minute, just what exactly? Just a... I'll be right back. These monsters are outside. You can't go out now, it's dangerous. But I... What's with you? You don't even know the way. I just want out. -Mr. Yamakoe. No, no. Let me go, let me go. We're still shooting, don't stop the camera. Don't go. You are not hurt. I am fine. You're not injured? I'm fine, and you? I am fine. Any wounds? No, I just said... Right... And you... OK, I'm fine. We're all good. No one is hurt. That's the most important. Right. Useless, you won't get a signal here. Nao-San. The rumors the Director just mentioned... is that what you spoke about? "Spreading blood is the spell that summons THAT back to life." What? -That's the untold part... "THAT"? Tell you later. Let's go down the mountain first. We'll get to the car. But there are monsters. You have a better way? No one will ever come to our rescue. What is "THAT"? Exactly, what happened here? Exactly, at that time... what did they do here? Hey, open the door. Wait. It's just me, I'm alone. Open the door, quick. Wait... wait. On a count of three... one, two, three. Action. What is it? Stay outside. Let me alone. Hit him. What does he want? Out you go. Push the monster out. He's a real monster. This is a great shot. Die monster, die. Very good, that's the real face of fear. This work will become a masterpiece. Let's run to the car. These monsters I'm gonna chop them all. Come. Run guys. Where is the key? -What? Who took them? -Kasahara. Kasahara-San. Kasahara-San. Kasahara-San. Action. He keeps the key in his black bag. Get it. -Don't open. Chinatsu, get back in the car. Don't hinder the camera. No, no. Don't... Nao-San. Nao-San. No. Don't come. No. No... No. Chinatsu. I sprained my ankle. Nao-San? She's fine, she is inside. Nao-San, it's us, open the door. Nao-San, open the door. Come in. Let's get in the car. Have you been bitten? I'm not sure. It's probably just bruises. Nao-San... It's OK, I just wanna be sure. Nao-San, calm down. I am calm, I am very calm. Nao-San. Don't. Pom. Don't come. Help me. Action. Don't hinder the camera. Go away. Leave alone. Don't, don't. You can run. Stop now. Don't run. I just want to be sure. You'll be fine. Nao-San. -Go away. Ouch, it hurts. You're breaking my hand. Stop the camera, help me. Don't come... No... Stay away from me. Don't come any closer. -What? Hurry, let's escape. Chinatsu. I have an axe too now. That's my luck. Kou-Chan. It hurts... Kou-Chan. What? Kou-Chan. Kou-Chan... No way. What is that? Kou-Chan... Please... don't do that. Excellent. See, you can do it, that's the face of fear. This scene will be the climax of my movie. Kou-Chan... Please... Stop it now. Kou-Chan... Kou-Chan it's me. Please. Wake up. Kou-Chan... Kou-Chan... Please... Don't do that. Please. I love you. Hey. What? Hey don't kill my actors. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, calm down. Yes, cut. A month before. I... feel alive. Good, OK. This take was OK? Yes excellent acting. -I made a mistake. Doesn't matter, we don't record the sound. Ah right. Next the crying scene. Face up, please. What scene is that? Why am I crying? We're on. -Alright, ready. Alright, action. It's been a while. Are you free after that? Mr. Higurashi, is this OK? Great, it's OK. Mr. HiguRashi. -Right. What do you usuaRRy shoot? Mostly pieces are for variety shows. Sometimes I do karaoke videos. I'm quite flexible, really. What was your motto already? Ah, right... Fast, cheap, good quality. This is it. You seem reliabRe. He could be our man. Really? A zombie piece? We're launching a zombie dedicated channel in August. We'll have a special drama for the opening. What is the story? An team shoots a zombie fiction in an abandoned buiRding. But they meet reaR zombies. They panic, they panic and they fight. It's about survivaR. I see. Here, there are two expRosions. ExpRosions? Ah, right. First, it will be broadcast Rive. Broadcast live? At 1:00-1:30 pm we have a live broadcast. Second, the most exciting point... a one-cut. A one-cut, you mean... Only one take... uninterrupted shooting. The camera is on from start to finish. A zombie piece... broadcast live... a one-cut. ExpRosive, right? Goodness, come on... You're not serious... No one does something so lousy. Eh? But I am seRious. Very seRious. Eh? You'll give it a try? Pom. Morioka Ryu, Self-defense for Women. Both arms straight up in the sky. Bend your knees, your body stays vertical. Then shout out loud... You shout 'Pom' loudly... it will distract him... while you run away. Pom. How were you offered that project? The others refused. An awful project. Well, you refused too, right? Ah, uhm... I didn't expect you to have the balls. I'm getting late. Dinner? -No need. Ah, wait... I'm going. -See you later. She'll be OK on that movie set? You're free today? Keep an eye on her. What? We need real tears. Alright? You can't rely on that fake stuff. Did you ever experience a tragedy? At school I was in the basketball team... excuse me, the director said the eye-drops are just fine. Excuse Mom, it's a battlefield. A battlefield? She is a fighter, here. We can't have a mom interfere. But the director... -Enough. We resume. I don't have time for this, let's move on. Don't listen to that broad. You called me 'that broad'? I'm sorry about that, but you see... What is that? -Let's resume. Please, Madame don't go. We're sorry about 'that broad'. Please, come back to the set. I'm sorry... professionally, she's excellent, she was helpful. But her personality... We can't work with her. I am very sorry. Goodbye. -Really sorry. Well, there... that's how you learn. You'll live on your own soon. You won't eat. I understand your quest for perfection. Mao. "On the rooftop of the hospital the poor man was crying loudly." "He had never cried before..." Eye-drop tears, right? Mr. Kusakabe, a lonely entrepreneur... tonight, his future was uncertain. Can I switch? Please, by all means. On a movie set... would you disagree with the director? Well, that is... if it benefits the movie, I would. Mom, you record these for me, right? Sure do. Who is that? Her latest crush. What is your next challenge? My next project... I can't say much about it. Can I say it? "Smeared with blood". You mean, a horror movie? "One Cut of the Dead" project, with Kamiya Akira. You should look forward to it. Thank you for the interview. "One Cut of the Dead" audition. I always wanted to play in a zombie movie. I'm a fan of yours. I'm honored (Actress Matsumoto Aika) That's so kind. Could you do your motto? Sure "Aika's beam". (actor Kamiya Akira) This story is really... it hides a racial theme. You may be right. (Hosoda, camera) I can't drink, or my hands shake. OK. (Yamanouchi, assistant director) Excuse me. Where did you see a racial theme? Sorry, I need to focus. OK, excuse me. Excuse me. This is hard water. Is there a problem? (Yamakoe, sound engineer) I only drink soft water. To avoid diarrhea. I mentioned it by mail. Oh, I’m sorry, you forgot? Give me real emotions. The true face of fear. The face (Kurooka plays the director) the face... Sorry I'm late. Good morning. -Good morning. What? I'm sorry. My husband is away... (Aida Mai, makeup) I can help you. She'll be very quiet, don't worry. Please, sit down. (Higurashi, Director) You are facing death. It's alright. Have you experienced fear? Yes, I tried to express... No, to express it is to fake it. OK. OK. Don't express it, live it. OK, 'live it' you mean? I want real fear. I must read fear on your face... Please Mr. director... Please Mr. director, calm down. Let's take a break. We take a break. OK, we're taking a break. What's wrong? This may be a problem... I'm supposed to vomit? Personally, I'd like to try... but my agent has rules... an idol can't be seen vomiting. But it's not your real vomit. Right, of course. No vomit scene, then. I wish I could vomit for you, but my agent... alright, then. Thanks guys. OK. May I? -OK. In the script you describe zombies using an axe. Yes. -So, zombies use axes? Yes, why? Since zombies have no consciousness... how can they use an axe? There are various zombies, nowadays. Zombies using an axe... I'm asking the director. Right. Let me inquire about it. -Please. Don’t cry, hello, hello. They are supposed to arrive... The first zombie entering is a scout zombie. He barges in, they all scream. Then the second zombie, Mr. Hosoda. They're here to set in the zombie atmosphere. It upsets the situation. Alright, action... Mr. Taniguchi. When the zombies arrive... a close-up of their face would be great, no? That's tacky. Tacky is cool. I don't think so. I won't do it. Are you OK? It won't be easy to operate with that back pain. I don't mind helping you. No, I won't let you. You won't be in that crew. I'll memorize all the moves. -No way. "We showed that move last time..." "but it won't be useful here." Mom. -Uhm? Will you do it again? -What? Acting? Now, I'll be moving away. You'll have time. Don't be silly. You're always with that script. It's entertaining. Entertaining? "Ho, ho." Why are you watching that? Who watches that? It's entertaining, a hobby. Self-defense? A hobby? What's wrong with my hobbies? You take up too many things. You do yoga, then social dance or hula dance... Self-defense? Precisely, the diversity... I take in the best in each to find myself. But you're an actress. No way. when I act I lose myself. Precisely, a good actress must lose herself. Mom, you should get back to it. -You never saw me act. You're an actress. -I'm done with this topic. Your dad will be directing a series. Really? That's not like him. With your idol, Kamiya. He'll have a role. What? Nao-San, calm down. I am calm. I am calm. -Nao-San. The zombie arrives now. Wrestle the axe from her hands... and stick it on her head. You don't like it? Nowadays, zombies even have machine guns. Don't worry. -Let me think. As I say. My part is small, I wish I had more exposure. I'll see about that. Thank you. Excuse me. The scene where I cry... do you mind eye-drops? You mean, you can't cry? It should be OK, I'm just asking. It's just one scene, so... OK then. -Thank you. Is there a toilet in the old building? We'll bring mobile toilets. Don't forget, and tell me where they are. Alright. I mailed you. Sorry. I told you. I'm sorry. You heard me? I'm sorry. Don't apologize, you heard me? I can't... Could you squat here? That's great, wait. Very good, that's it. That's a weird bunch. Look who's talking. Sorry about last time. I got banned. No way. But now I quit the booze. Really? I can't hold saké. Who is she? -My daughter. When I drink too much, I look at it. Works like a charm. You see... saké made me lose her several times. What? Last year too... I was finally granted to see her. I was so nervous that day, I drank from the morning. And then? I fell asleep and stood her up. -Awful. Awful, my whole life is awful. But I like it. I wish she was proud of her dad... that won't happen. Probably. Come on, Mr. Hosoda, don’t... You don't have to cry. Is it that tough? What? I need to ask you something. What? Well... Good morning.-Good morning guys. You guys are really busy here. Let's boil the water. Open it all. Pushing. You're OK? Great, it works. Hold it. I want you to come here for a close-up. With that angle? -Right. Sorry to barge in. I understand she wants to see the set. Right. I heard she wants to become a director. Yes. Like father, like daughter. The children grow with the parents' model. I can't see him. You're right. Don't worry, about the mistakes. Since we don't stop the camera. Unless something big happens... I count on everyone's cooperation. The handsome producer sent this. Thank you. -What origin? It's from Niigata. Later, we'll see that. Keep it out of sight. (private bottle) how about Kurooka and Sawada? Stuck in the traffic I can't reach them. They're coming. Please call again. Mr. Higurashi. An accident? No injuries? Nothing serious it seems. Why did they ride together? They shouldn't have come together. But it's terrible? -Right. Please get everything ready. -Alright. They won't make it. We stop everything? -We can't. Let's move on. -Move on? What time is it? 11, it's in two hours. We change the script? It's a one-cut, we know our course. Let's find actors. We're two hours away from Tokyo. No one will arrive in time. We have to proceed. Mr. Higurashi. Are you serious? In high school I was in the drama club. Wait a minute. -You have someone else? I fit the profile and I know the part. There's just me. Right. Let's do that. Wait, how about the makeup? What? She used to be an actor. Uh? -And... she sneak learned the script. Don’t... You know the lines? Well, I read it a hundred times. A hundred times? But I can't... You got it. Wait. I can't... Impossible. -Why? You never saw your mother act. I'll have to apologize. He's right. You have no one. No way. I can't. No way. I can't do that. Thank you. I'm quitting. This is for the movie that will stay. The TV shows comes before. People are waiting in front of their TV. We owe them to deliver. Please. -If it's for the show... You know all this is for you. You're central to this work. I promise it will be good. I swear. What happened? Well I... I'll be right back. Are you OK? -I won't let you. I'm sorry. I don't mind, but a director playing a director? Right... you're so nice, don't hesitate to instruct me. Alright. -Thank you. Please listen everyone. We're going to start. As you know, no interruptions. Live broadcast, no advertising. Once it starts, we won’t stop the camera. Thank you in advance. Countdown 10 seconds, 9, 8, 7... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2... OK, started, Go guys. Ken-Chan, please. Please wake up, no. I love you. Cut. Is that good? How many so far? This is the 42nd. You are facing death. Yes. Did you really feel fear? That director is a natural. Don't express it. Live it. OK, 'live it' you mean? I want real fear. I must read fear on your face... You know why you can't deliver? Because your whole life is fake. You liiiie your way through it. Take off your fake mask. That wasn't in the script. Don't interrupt me, little twit. This is my work... It's my work. You dare nag me on my set? Stop, take a break, a break. She's really into it. There's nothing fake in this girl. Don't hinder the work. Sorry, got carried away. Don't bother them. Mr. Hosoda has disappeared. He's on in two minutes. What happened? Mr. Hosoda. Mr. Hosoda. Saké on his breath. Get me the script. OK. Mr. Hosoda, come on. Are you OK? Who knows... But it doesn't stop at that. -There's more? "Keep going we are not ready." Hey, it scared me. Good timing. Was it the wind? Tell me Nao-San... You have hobbies? Why do you ask that? We can have a lighter topic. Well, call that a hobby, I'm studying self-defense. Self-defense. Pom. You did it. -It’s amazing. What are they doing? You did it skillfully. -It’s amazing. Director, it's now or never. You scared me. What is this? It's makeup? You could be an actor. OK, we're done playing. Hey, what do you want? Hey. No, let me go... What was that? A towel, quick. It's disgusting, it smells... No towels? -Sorry. He stinks. No. So real. Isn't that a good crew? Mr. Hosoda. Have we started? -We have. Mr. Director, take it. Where are you going? You're on. Good. Just a year ago in summer... a day so hot I couldn't breathe... I was at home writing a script. I read a strange account on a blog... Hey, where are you going? Just a... -Just what? Wait a minute, just what exactly? Be right back. What? What scene is that? No idea. There are monsters outside. You can't go out now, it's dangerous. They are improvising. -Great. No. What's wrong with you? No script. Mr. Yamakoe. It's his real name. -Stop. No. Another one's gonna get bitten, so exciting. We'll send a text-screen. (Please wait a moment) We keep shooting, the camera won't stop. He said that to the camera. Mr. Yamakoe, what's got into you? I have to go, I have to go. What? Shit... we can't stay live. Nao-San, you're not hurt? I am fine, you? They keep asking that. Can't we move on with to Yamakoe? The storyline is incoherent. Let's stop it. Mr. Yamakoe will arrive as a zombie. You can jump back to line 7 on page 14. Hey lady, look here. From page 15 line 15 to page 16 and line 11. We're playing from this line. there's no time. Where? Line 11 is here, quick. Hey sir, hurry, your decision. We do it. OK. Lady, send a text. We're so glad no one is hurt. (Looking for a phone signal, "What happened?" Keep going.) (Yamakoe comes back as a zombie) Useless, you won't get a signal here. Sorry, you have to go here, quickly. It's OK... Do his makeup now. -What? Don't cry, hurry up. Good. Where is the head? Yamakoe's head? Have you seen his head? Lady, lady. Found it, go. Have you seen Mr. Hosoda? Dude, dude. Wake up, come over, take care of him. Now everyone focuses on the second part. Who is she? Action. Very good, that's what I want. Push the monster out. It's awful. Die monster, die. Very good, that's the real face of fear. This work will become a masterpiece. Let's run to the car. These monsters I'm gonna chop them all. Come here. Where is the key? -What? Who took them? -Kasahara. Kasahara-San. Action. The key in his black bag. He is coming. -I am not afraid. Don't hinder the camera. Don't... Idiot. Go away. No. No. Nao-San. What? What shot is that? There. -It's messy. That's awesome. who's holding the camera? What's this mess? I have to go. -You slapped me. Even my dad never dared. I'll teach you brat... can't you obey? Go to your set, now. Are you okay? -Uh? Calm down. -I am calm, very calm. Your mom is amazing. Never saw her like this. She's not an actor? She loses herself into her character. Once during a movie... she broke a guy's arm in an action scene. She was banned from all movie sets. She's such an actor. Is she safe? Nao-San... It's OK, I just wanna be sure. Nao-San. Nao-San, calm down. -I'm very calm. Stop. Pom. She's totally off script, Mr. Director. Let the zombies stop her. What should I do? Calm down. Help me. Action. Don't get in the way. Don't run. Don't run. Don't worry about me, stop her. Don't run. Don't run. Stop. -It's OK. What do you want? Ouch, it hurts. You're breaking my hand. Pom. Pom. I’m scared, I'm scared. Pom. Pom. Sorry. Stop, don't do that. Don't. Don't do that. It's kind of longish. Don't. No script. Don't come any closer. -What? Hurry, let's escape. Chinatsu. Thank god. -Just use me. I can't think anymore. Don't think too hard. We need the axe for the last scene. Leave it there, she'll pick it up. Do as I tell you. (Take the axe in front of the shed) There was an axe here. That's my luck. The camera crane is broken. The crane is broken. Let's change the camera. We need a 4m high shot. -Why? For the ending we shoot the blood on the ground. The ending? That blood summoned up the zombies. Please read the script. Let's scratch that. Wait a minute. -We can't wait. Only 5 min left. -5 min. This scene completes my movie. No one will care. Some will see. Who? I'm sorry. I lost my cool. Mr.Higurashi. The TV show comes before the movie. Give it up, that's the best. I get it. Good. No shot with the crane. We'll end when she pulls his foot. Alright. Write a board for the camera. Yes. Wait. How many people do you need. Kou-Chan. Kou-Chan... No way. What is that? What is that? A crane. Kou-Chan... please... Don’t. -Excellent. See, you can do it, that's the face of fear. This scene will be the climax of my movie. Kou-Chan. Please. Stop. Kou-Chan, it's me, it's me. Please. Wake up. Kou-Chan. Please. Don't. Please. I love you. What? Hey don't kill of my actors. Hey, what are you doing? Calm down. Enough, I can’t stand it. Keep going, you're doing just fine. Now it's the climax. 15s before the end of the show. 10, 9, 8, 7... 6, 5, 4, 3... 6, 5, 4, 3... 2, 1. Yes, cut. The beginning was reaRRy uncertain... but today you made it smoothRy. Thank you aRR. Thank you. I'm counting on you in the futuRe. Thank you. Going for a drink? Let's go. Official opening. Ready... Action.
