The new People's Italy marched to conquer an Empire. ...in the heart of Africa. But in 45 days of intrlgue, of cowardice, of re-emerging filth... ...all was lost! Your attention. His Majesly the King and Emperor. ...has accepled the resignation. ...submitted by His Excellency Cavalier Benito Mussolini. Italy vanished, engulfed by the abyss of betrayal. On the 8th of September, with the enemy advanoing... ...restrained only by Hitler's soldiers... ...the Nation's flag was shamefully lowered. ...in the occupied territories. But one day, since surely there is a God of Italy... ...from the mountain of Gran Sasso a "stork" took flight. ...and the Man of our Destiny was restored to us! Out of so much undoing, the young Republic was reborn. The besl sonsof Italy, wearing again the gray-green of four wars... ...lo the prodigious voice of the One who leads us, readily reply. Against all, we shall win! THE END There are many empty seats... ...those of the profiteers who yesterday applauded the head of Fascism. ...and who now turn their backs. You, the best, remain. Italian Cinema will rise again with you. Rome cannot be defended much longer. That's why we've decided to transfer everything to Venice... where, with our German ally, you will resume yourwork. Cinecitt? will rise again on the lagoon. De Sica, Blasetti, Rossellini, Soldati are missing? So much the better, Italian cinema can do without them. Thank you, you can go. Would you come with me? I have to talk to you. Do you intend to hide too? Me, hide? I know they run to the Vatican as soon as they leave here. Good! I'll finally be offered the good roles. It's the end of the line, it's over. I don't know how or when, but it's over. Now that II Duce regains command of the "men without blemish"? II Duce is the F?hrer's hostage... ...he accepts the role of puppet to salvage what he can. It's not encouraging to hear you talk like this, Cardi. The Director General of Motion Pictures! This is a friend talking to you. A friend? Luisa's, not yours. You can't imagine how I detest you. I'm sorry, I thought you be resigned by now. I keep an eye on you, I know who you are. Agambler! You live far beyond your means. ...you're in the usurers' hands and you've never had a Party card. Maybe because it embarrassed them. But they gave me this. COCAINE ADDICT Always a braggart! You're right, I'm an addict. A squanderer, a gambler, a rake. But above all I'm an actor, maybe that's the worst thing. I incarnate other's fantasies... I represent what everyone would like to do but doesn't dare. That's why I always get the bad-guy parts. Since that's how you all see me, I've become a bad-guy. Forten years I've been shooting a film, "Wild Blood"... ...it's a Sicilian expression. What is it? It's my shit. That's right. Shit, blood, money, sex... What we want to hide, what we don't want to know... what our prudish and conformist little films don't show. There are those who'd like to be a hero, like our Duce... ...others a gentleman, like you who loves Luisa, but spies on her. And some like me, who feel a delightful lust in self-degradation... ...in sinking into and transforming everything into shit. Here I am. And Luisa? How does she fit? It would have been better if she was like you. Women are born to have families... ...to grow old by the fire, to be safe. But unfortunately, she's like me. I'm not coming to Venice, this is my letter of resignation. After that speech? Here I've named you as my successor. You'll make an excellent Director General. Take it to the Minister. But if you say it's all going to pot! Listen to me carefully. The General Director is treated like a Minister. His work obliges him to move around. In other words he can travel... with a diplomatic passport, and no restrictions. I don't see your point. The General Director can plan. ...a visit to Spain. You can get to South America. You're still in time. ...and you can save yourselves, you and Luisa. I'm speechless. You're suggesting I escape? We've said itall. My respects to Madame Ferida. What will you do? I'll watch your star shine ever more brightly in the heavens. "Your Excellency... wilh this letler I communicate. ...my resignation as Director General of Motion Pictures... ...a deoision I am forced to make for reasons of health. At the same time, I desire to indicate in Osvaldo Valenti... ...bearer of this letter, a worthy candidale... who has Ihe necessary prestige... ...determination, personality. ...and expertise to fill the chair which sadly I must vacate. Respectfully, Attilio Cardi. Rome, Oclober 4, 1943... XXI Fascist Year. " Venice, October 1943 Valenti! Excellency! - Whata pleasure to see you. - You appeared like deities. I bow to you. Remember Prince Junio Valerio Borghese? - How are you? - Much better for seeing you. - I see you're busy. - Letthem wait! I was told you were coming, let's have a drink. Don't be offended, the journey was long, I'm going to bed. You're a lucky man. We have to get moving, take back the initiative. We can't act like Mussolini and leave everything in German hands. If today there were no units like the 10th, that fight... ...that keep their word... ...know what the Germans would do? They'd reduce us to a pile of rubble like Poland, Holland and Hungary! I totally agree. If you gentlemen will excuse me... Don't get up, please. My daughter would so like Mr Valenti's autograph. - What's her name? - Valentina, in your honor. "To Valentina, Osvaldo Valenti. " Thank you and forgive the intrusion. The girl was an excuse, she wanted that autograph herself. She drools over an actor and didn't even realize. ...the hero of Alessandria was sitting right here! This shows something, that today's heroes are you. Popularity travels faster than any venture. What did I tell you? An idiot! People need to identify with someone. Don't under estimate popularity, it can be very important... ...if you put itat the service of a just cause. What's the film? It's not a film, it's my uniform. Lt. Valenti, 10th MAS Flotilla, this is for real. You joined? Are you mad? What's the war to you? I'm giving Borghese a hand, he says men will follow me. It's better they join up with the 10th than with the Fascists. What would the difference be? The Fascists just want revenge, they have it in for Italians. For the 10th, the enemy's still the Anglo-Americans. You've always despised politics! Borghese does too, at least we'll get something going with him. What do you need to get going? If you think I enjoy making these stupid little films. ...and playing cards with the Germans... Then it wasn't a great idea to come to Venice. No. Get out. The other way. Because you didn't want to do anything to help me. To change things, to make films that aren't so stupid. Instead, you hang around depressed, turning down scripts. - You call these scripts? - It's work! They're arguing... Yes, first they argue then they screw. But it's been a while now that they just argue. Yes, they're mediocre scripts, poorly written... ...but Alfiero Corazza lets you do what you want. What kind of director is that? I want to do real films. Here we're leads, in real films we had supporting roles. At least they were good roles! I'd say... ...this uniform cuts a damned good figure. Perfect, you look like Borghese's double. - Do at least one favor for me. - Oh Heavens, just say the word! Leave, cease this and torment me no further. Is this the favor you promised to concede me? - I won't prevent you from pursuing. - But with bad grace! You shouldn't tend to my grace, you should just tend to your own. "Satisfy". Not "tend to", "satisfy". The line is: "You shouldn't tend to my grace... ...you should just satisfy your own", it's awful if you repeat "tend". Sorry. Sorry, I got mixed-up. Don't worry, it's nothing. Alfiero, another one. - Would we like to do another? - Yes. "Don't tend to my grace, you should just satisfy your own. " - Certainly, dear. - Good girl. Let's take it from the top. Take your starting positions. Move! - Another one! - Ready to shoot. - Camera! - Rolling! Clapper. 26-4, 39th. Good. Action! Is this the favor you promised to concede me? - I won't prevent you from pursuing. - But with bad grace! You shouldn't tend to my grace, you should just tend to... Satisfy... Sorry. I can't get it today! You should just satisfy your own! As for me, it will be my care to satisfy the wants of the Minister. ...in case he'd like to have a nice blow job! It's the only reason I'm on this set... ...the only reason I'm an actress! Do something, make him be quiet! Corazza! Are you nuts? You can't talk to her like that, she'll stop the film! - What a ghastly tragedy! - Why be such an asshole? - These are the films we can do! - And that's okay with you? You snap to attention for the first cock sucker around? That's your attitude? Great. They probably won't touch you, you scare them... The 10th scares him, let him try to tell me anything! Put it down, it might go off. It might go off... I knew we shouldn't have come here... ...that it was a trap, we should have stayed in Rome. In Rome they've even started filming again. Who knows with what means or film. Rossellini is making a film on Rome. Roberto Rossellini, a former assistant of mine! He's in Rome making his film. with Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi. Magnani and Fabrizi, vaudeville actors, it's a comedy? I don't think so. Magnani and Fabrizi... The was no role for Valenti, they had to take Fabrizi! - What's he playing? - A priest, I think. A priest? I've never played one, no one ever offered it. They don't think Valenti can play a priest. Alfiero dear, please, in the next film will you let me be. ...a priest? Isn't all that stuff bad for you? Be quiet! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Take the uniforms off those bastards, look for two clean ones. So we can get through the road blocks. Go! Go, Luisa. Put her next to Piero. The curly-haired guy. Sergeant? Come here. What's going on? I have orders to check everyone. See these stripes? Do you know who I am? - You're Osvaldo Valenti. - Lieutenant Osvaldo Valenti. At your command. Move the blockade, let us through. Let them through. Stop! Hands up! No tricks, come on! Achilli, don't you know me? It's Vero. Get down. - Vero, I have to talk to you. - What is it? - Are they Valenti and Ferida? - And if they are? - It says here they've been shot. - Right. Maybe it's not true and someone's wasting time. I have orders to deliver them to the CLN. Turn them over to me, it's best. I said I'd deliver them. Hug the wall, there may be snipers. Do as he says. Excuse me, Ma'am, Captain Arrivabene is here... ...or rather, Count Arrivabene, who's asked to see you. Hello, I'm Leonardo Arrivabene, I'm to deliver these. 286 00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,468 - Who from? - There's a note. "Luisa, follow this officer. G." Golfiero? He's my cousin. Stop! Around the corner! Are you alright? - Where's that bastard? - Must be the last house. Stop them! Stop that car! Stop! Grab his legs. Grab his legs, careful. What happened to you? I had no news. They freed me after July 25th. I crossed the lines and joined the Allies. They parachuted me into the North to do undercover work. Do you trust him? If I can't trust my cousin... He's risking, you could report him. - You know I'd never do that. - That's why I'm here. I'm here to take you away. - What? - I want you to come to Milan. You can't have anything more to do with these people. - It's too late. - No! People like you, you haven't disappointed them. - Just imagine... - But you have to leave Venice. Rome has been liberated, you could hide in my home. Would you hide him too? How can I, the way he behaves? He compromises himself, struts around in that uniform! - He takes part in the clean-ups! - That's not true. - The 10th doesn'tdo clean-ups. - Of course they do! Don't you see what's going on? Don't you realize you're with a gang of crooks? Osvaldo would never hurt anyone. He's just irresponsible. I'm not here for him. I'm here for you. How could you think I'd dump him? Walk out on him? Open your eyes. Have you ever been in love with anyone? What do you mean by that? If you'd loved someone, you'd know. Love is for house maids! Ferida, come with me, Taylor wants to see you. No, you stay put. Follow me. They keep saying I'll pull through. Of course you will. The strange thing is... I can't feel anything any more. They must have loaded me with morphine. Vero? You have to give them a regulartrial. - Or you'll answer to me. - Okay, I promise. I won't let you do my next film! I got it. Where've you been? Hurry! - How many did you get? - Four. Now three. What the fuck do I do with three? You should have taken much more! It's not my fault if there's none around. Besides, the bastards want to be paid in gold. There's nothing around anymore! There is one possibility. - What's that? - In Milan, in the hospitals. There's more action, but it's a nasty environment. How do I get inside a hospital? Get admitted? We need to organize a visit to the wounded. - If Madame Luisa came... - Are you crazy? What are you thinking? The wounded need morphine! And me? I don't? Didn't you see how the fuck I was? Leave us a moment. Out! Want to preach me another sermon? Do you realize what you're doing? When will you stop? You're an idiot, petty bourgeoise, justan extra! You disgust me! You make me sick! Then why don't you get the fuck out? Where the fuck do you think you're going? Let go of me! 368 00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,713 Son of a bitch! Don't touch me! Forgive me. Hello. Pietro Koch, Special Police, Italian SS. Ma'am... "These rose petals are like drops of blood on the snow. " Wonderful, the great Valenti, you're my idol. You're both my idols, Ferida-Valenti... ...the best actors in Italian cinema! Since when are you in business for yourself? No Pietro, I took it for you. Look. It's yours. It's yours. Good boy. Mom... - Lovely sweet face. - Did you film Dusnella? Yes. Luisa, doesn't she look like you? Yes, it's true, she does a little. You're her idol, she imitates you. Desy, come here, let the original see you. Come on, don't be shy! A pleasure, Marchi Dusnella. Desy. When Luisa gets a headache, she can be her double. She's good at it! To Dusnella, the woman for a headache! And to Pietro Koch, who's got a real head... For a target! Great! Agiant of life and of the screen. To Luisa Ferida, the most beautiful woman in Italy. The most beautiful in the world! Cheers! - Satisfy a curiosity of mine. - At your command. Where do you keep the prisoners? What prisoners? The ones you torture for the Nazis. Want to see them? Want to film them? Come on, come with me. - Desy, feed them. - With what? What do you mean 'with what'! This. So? It's what we eat too. Move, feed them! Delicacies. Too bad Madame Luisa doesn't want to see them. They'd have loved it. They'll have to settle for her double. Let's see if they fall for it. Know who's feeding you today? The most important actress in Italian cinema, Luisa Ferida! Do you know who's with her? The most important actor in Italian cinema, Osvaldo Valenti! Do you want to film them? Want to film them? Come on, you have that thing... I've nothing to hide. Film. Come on, a big hand for Luisa Ferida and Osvaldo Valenti! A big hand! Why are you with this scum? You're an artist! Get out! Why are you with this scum? - Shut up! - You're an artist! Get out! Shut that violinist bitch up! Shut up! You have to shut up! I wake up at night with nightmares. I feel my body doesn't belong to me. Idon't recognize it. ...I haven't menstruated in two years. Don't worry, dear, things will normalize with the pregnancy. - What? - You're three months pregnant. Are you happy or not? Let's see, how's your homework coming? 6 times 7 isn't 41, it's 42. Audile! Close the doors. Excuse the inconvenience, we're just checking documents. Any dangerous outlaws hiding on this tram? Sister, should I check under your skirts? Just joking... Lady, are you hiding something? Of course not... Excuse me, sir. There was a little shaving cream on your neck. Thank you. Notat all. Do you mind if I sit next to you? Please do. Thank you. Excuse me, Lieutenant. - Speak, divine child. - Are you Osvaldo Valenti? I was Sandokan, Giannettaccio... Henry and Genghis Khan! A cruel Turk, a wicked Baron, a murderer and a seducer... I've never been a priest. Right you are! Valenti is my name. Born in Constantinople and died a thousand times in a thousand places! Can I have your autograph? And ifl were illiterate? - What's your name? - Ginevra. - You? - Itala. What a nice scent of school, of virgin flesh... That's enough, back to your seats. Nothing is more squalid than the vanity of actors. Are you making a film? I'm about to start filming a beautiful movie. I'll be acting along side my wife, Luisa Ferida... ...it's entitled "Wild Blood" ...and it'll be directed by the greatest of all Italian directors: Golfiero Goffredi. What's the story about? It's a love story. Two men love the same woman. ...and so they hate each other. They fight a war one against the other. The woman loves them both. ...and doesn't know how to choose... ...she can't, it wouldn't be right. Each of them is a part ofher. - Good and evil? - No, too easy. Good and evil are merged, both men are good and evil. She too, is good and evil. How does it end? Like all fairy tales: The good guys come, the bad guy dies. Enough, go back, I can't reveal any more. Go sit down. 10th MAS Flotilla! Audile open up, we'll get off here! It's a nice ring, but... let me show you something. Of course, maybe Desy... It might be exciting for her to have one of Luisa Ferida's rings. I'm coming. Hello, Madame Luisa! Hello. Look how nice the lady is, she's giving you this ring. What? Is it really for me? Yes. Thank you! Your face is floury. There. I think Madame Ferida never gives anything for nothing. Who knows what she wants in exchange... Who knows what you want in exchange. How beautiful you are. You're both so beautiful! Clean... Like that. Yes, undress her. Undress her. Beautiful... Luisa and my little Desy. You're so beautiful! - Put that gun away. - What? Can't you see it bothers her? Sure, I will. There, it's gone. I don't want to keep it... What is it you won't keep? Not in this world or in this life... What? Who? The baby, I don't want it anymore. You're expecting a baby? I don't want it. I won't give birth to another like you. The baby? It's safe inside me. My father... ...always wanted me to have a child. A child of yours would be so beautiful. A child... I could have had one only with you. What will you call him? Golfiero... ...like you. When you're healed, we'll run off and have ten more children! You're rich enough. Ten... Milan, April 29, 1945 Bring in the prosecuting witness. Where did you disappear to? The defendant must remain silent. Witness Sturla has earned our trust. Thanks to him, we arrested Minister Buffarini Guidi. If these are the people working for you... Fabulous! The defendant must try to maintain proper behavior. Go ahead. For a long time I associated with big shots. The opium-filled ones! Silence, or I'll clear the courtroom. Go on, Shitmanikov, say what shots you got for the big shots! You have to shut up! So? I did... They made me do... I didn't do anything, I never tortured anyone. You're not being accused, just give the facts. I don't have it in for anyone... We want to know if this man. was a Fascist. Clear question, clear answer. Did you understand the question? It's not that he's a Fascist. He's Sandokan... The Pirate ofMalaysia. Silence, or the trial will resume behind closed doors! I'll clear the courtroom! We're in a court oflaw, not a caf?. I'll ask you again. Was Valenti a Fascist or not? What should I do? What do I do? Tell me! Tell them what they want. - Up, let's go, I'm taking you away. - Where? I'm freeing you. Get moving, before I change my mind. We have to pack, my film... Just one! Vero? You know what doubles are? Imagine we're not Valenti and Ferida... ...that Valenti and Ferida have escaped to Argentina and are safe. We're their doubles... ...two misfortunate doubles, with nothing to do with this. Ever thought of that? We're all doubles. Go, you're free. Go. The sign. We placed the sign. Wantto check? No. That's it... We have carried out justice... EXECUTED OSVALDO VALENTI AND LUISA FERIDA
