[clink] - [Man] Look at you. With your smartphones, your flat whites, your power shakes, your SUVs, stuffing your faces while the world burns. [machines beeping] Do you like what they gave you? You fat enough yet? Do you feel cheated? You cheat yourself. You go on cheating yourselves, accepting their gifts because you're stupid, lazy, downtrodden, fearful. Wake up. They are not in charge. - Without us, they have no money, no labor, no infrastructure. You can't turn back the clock, say here's your wine. Well enough. Stand the fuck up and be counted! Because this is the time! This is the place! And you. You are the person. [rock music] - [Woman] The RFID chip is painless and totally free. - [Man] We'll empty banks, interrupt the web, encrypt satellites, GPS. We're gonna bring down your house and watch it burn. - [Man] This kid hacked into the federal reserve, the world bank, and five multi, he almost bankrupt the city. - [Woman] Nash Jones. Brother of Hardin. Prisoner 4011787. - He can get to anyone. Including him. - [Woman] And even visit panopticon TV. Drama has never been so real. [tense music] [radio chatter] [keys clacking] - Tell me about your brother, Nash. Burned fingerprints, drugged eyeballs. Even super recognizers couldn't pick him up. Don't worry, he's still alive. Very much so in fact. He and his little posse hacked the Federal Reserve. A lot of people are very upset. It's election year, they need a scalp. You give Nash up and all this goes away. Every prior conviction. Clean sheet, start over. I'll see to it Nash gets a fair trial. Possibly just a slap on the wrist, public humiliation, maybe five years in juvie at most. I'm trying to help you, Hardin. They can get to anyone, including him. - You said they needed a scalp, one scalp. You've got it, that's the deal. - Don't make me do this! [knocking] [gate clacking] If you go down for this, Hardin, that's it for you. Life over. [men chattering] [clanking] [helicopter rotor chugging] [somber music and singing] [crowd shouting] [bashing] - [Man] Good job, big boy! [radio chatter] [siren sounding] - Only we taught them to feel, to empathize and we just dumped them. There's no social support for the robot class yet they have mental health issues way beyond our spectrum. - [Woman] Here at Panopticon TV, you can share the most intimate details of Hardin's existence. Read the books Hardin reads, download his playlist and films he likes. [siren sounding] Loyalty customers qualify for felon app which allows you to adopt your very own felon, watch him 24/7 and even visit Panopticon TV. Drama's never been so real. - [Man] We have the censors [mumbling] because people are not proud of themselves but because they don't want to. We'd rather have someone to blame, rather be a victim. Masters or slaves, educated or uneducated, rich have dominated poor, so good. Every now and again someone comes along to challenge this democratic idea. But very few [mumbling] And that's why the system will change. [honking] [jazz music] [crowd chattering] - Welcome to the conference, Mr. Green. - Thank you. - We also know that Panopticon TV is a financial and ratings success. What if Prison TV could be expanded to a whole new town? Where felons live, work, and earn their way back into society? Newtown not only finances itself via subscriptions and advertising, it provides thousands of jobs for the long term unemployed. tHe town is up and running and Hardin Jones will be the first felon to test it. Welcome to Newtown. [crowd applauding] [siren sounding] - [Nash] Why is he being transferred? - He's launching the new show, Panopticon Interactive: Newtown. It's cool, really. You tune in, you can live there and even interact with the felons. - And everybody gets to watch. Like Panopticon TV. - It's more interactive than that. There's subscribers who can choose who passes and who fails. And if you pass, you get to rejoin society. - And that's a prize? - What if you fail? When's he being transferred? - Why not spring him? - Armed guards, soldiers, trucks. This isn't our battle. We hit them where it hurts. Commerce, communication, power grid, the workforce. - Down the system and mute the citizens. They love him, they'll do whatever he tells them. - He's your brother, and you want him out. All right, I get that. But we don't have the firepower or the numbers. - But we have other weapons. Think about it, B. They gotta take him out of the city, desert, straight shot. I say we hit the convoy. - I could access the dashboard functions. Steering, brakes, transmission. You just tell me where you want the convoy and I'll send it. - Two billion subscribers. How long you think it's gonna take to find access like that? When Hardin wears a particular brand of jeans, they sell out in two hours. - Gotta show 'em we mean business. - They'll know we mean business. [sighing] All right. But I want that fit sorted. And I want that fucker Lyndon to know what's coming. Your brother better come through. - He hates those fuckers more than we do. - He better. - Showtime. [tense music] - [Woman] Here at Newtown, we offer a more fulfilled existence. One where you can realize your dreams while getting paid. Newtown is safe, clean and currently accepting residents. [ominous music] [radio chatter] [clanking] [clanging] - Wakey wakey. [men shouting] [chains clinking] - [Woman] You're going to be transferred, Hardin. No more fights. A kind of halfway house. Shops, bars, girls. This is a big opportunity for you. [cars starting] [revving] [chirping] [siren blaring] [radio chatter] - [Man] Going west on six. - [Man] You got another assignment there, Central? - [Woman] We have a redirection order, just confirming. - Redirection confirmed. [siren blaring] - [Woman] Drama's never been so real. [siren sounding] - Go, go, go go! [tense music] - Take off the traffic lights. Take them out. - Jam, goddamit. - Go, go, go, go! - Hardin! Shit. [siren blaring] - [Barca] Why did he run? - [Nash] He wouldn't have known who we are. - What, your own brother doesn't recognize you? Does he even know who he is? We lost three good men today, three. And for what? A fucking brain dead messiah? - [Nash] We need to find him. - No. We stick to the plan, the one we've been preparing for. He's chipped up to the eyeballs. They follow him, they follow us. - He's my brother. - Was. Harvesters, organ buses, crazed fans. He's already gone. From now on, we stick to the fucking plan. - [Charles] 10 prisoners, each with an IQ over 160, all under 25. - [Alexandra] Harden Jones isn't under 25. - Now why would you be transferring your biggest attraction? - Newtown. The prison overflow is a fantastic opportunity for felons. We're talking about a controlled, rehabilitative environment where they learn a new trade, mix with regular citizens and earn their way back into society. - You know a lot of regular citizens who like to hang out with murderers and pedophiles? - I believe you refer to them as the unemployed. - You're not thinking of opening this up to subscribers. - Crime's down, consumerism's up, what's not to like? They're all chipped. We've already found three of them. - Was Jones one of the three? - It's only a matter of time. - And what if he gets online and starts instructing the faithful? - His brain's mush. He's had more drugs pumped into him than Central America. - Has he? And what happens when he finds that out, because you know, if that was me and I suddenly discovered that I was the world's biggest brand, I think I'd be really, really pissed. - [Woman] Here at Panopticon TV, you could share the most intimate details of Hardin's existence. Read the books Hardin reads, download his playlists and the films he likes. Loyalty customers qualify for felon app. - Hardin may be on the loose right now, but in the city where the online betting community never sleeps, it's surely only a matter of time until odds on his recapture become pretty attractive. [thumping] [tense music] - [Machine] Welcome back, Mr. Goodwin. Diagnosis, syphilis. Your medication will be dispensed in three seconds. Have a great day. - [Robot] Parking violation 313. Lethal disruption initiated. - [Woman] Prisoner 4110787. [machine gun firing] - [Announcer] Behavioral alert. Grid H25673, please remain in your rotation. Please remain in your rotation. - And the donut. - I need the donut. - So do I. - [Announcer] Behavioral alert. Grid H25673, please remain in your rotation. Please remain in your rotation. - Hey, you wouldn't be taking my good coat down into that sewer now, would you? - [Announcer] Smoking is not permitted in the street. It is a federal offense. Please extinguish your cigarette in the cans provided or face a minimum fine of 50,000 won. You have 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven. [zapping] - [Man] Facefirst, the only 10 key biometric face recognition solution with revolutionary flexibility in inquisition, identification and alerting. Live hi-definition video enables Facefirst to track, isolate, [siren sounding] - We want an end to mandatory fingerprinting and prison TV. We want an independent corruption trial for all successive governments up to the present day and a reintroduction of the Glass-Steagall act. Should you fail to comply, we will empty two international banks of all currency and distribute the money. We will set up our own courts live and online, interrupt web transmissions, release prisoners, plunge the city into darkness. Our demands are reasonable. We ask only the same of you. Four demands, seven days, no negotiation. [phone ringing] - Is this for real? They sound like kids. - They are kids. - Well, these kids have names? - It's their group. - But they have profiles, right? - Can't arrest every border aspect under 20 who lives at home. - Why not? - You'd look like Herod. - Well infiltrate their chatrooms. Find addresses. I mean they're online 24-7. - We're dealing with a sophisticated hive mind here. You can't just go in and pretend to be a bee. - Can they do it? - Yeah banks have been emptied remotely before. They also sent a 37 plate memorandum to accompany their video and it's pretty inclusive. They've done their research. Taxes reduced from 60 to 20 percent for all citizens living in the suburbs. 28 percent for those in cities. And corporations pay 100 percent as the fine for the first year and then 26.7 percent thereafter. These kids sound pretty organized. - Let's just hope they're bluffing. - I can't access the data warehouses. Nielsen runs too tight a ship. Robotics 916 who makes the chips, they're much less secure. Here's a list of all the RFID serial numbers allocated to each jail. There's currently eight active chips outside the jail with two within the same host. I'm assuming that's Hardin. I'm guessing it's one from the jail and one from the advertisers. He's worth a lot of money to them. - Well, you can hack and check on this? How many other people can access this? - They'd have to be as good as me. - Well but if he knows he's chipped, he'll lose them. - Well so long as they're not second generation. Those'll burn out if you tamper with them. - Where is he now? - He looks around grid six. - Yeah. - Near the old train tracks. [rat squeaking] [grunting] - [Robot] I need to find a home. I can live with children and animals and my battery condition is excellent. - Next. Next. Card. Remove your shades. How long have you been in the penal system? - 10 years. - Kidneys okay? Kidneys and corneas, there's a shortage. - [Hardin] Just need the food stamps. - Can you fight? Mm-mm honey, that's not for you. That's for real people. Ex cons are the entertainment. Next. - [Woman] Here at Newtown, we offer a more fulfilled existence. One where you can realize your dreams while getting paid. [cashier beeping] - According to this, he's in division 14 but his chip is in division 12. - [Alexandra] Try the second chip. - [Woman] He'd have removed that as well, wouldn't he? - If he knew he had it. - That's not very citizenly. - We need an NC unit immediately. Jones is at the corner of Mission and Gate heading west. - Why is he so important to you? - The audience likes him. - Right. - [Woman] Prisoner 4110787 has been located. All reported sightings of Hardin Jones can qualify for community action rewards. [siren sounding] Please remain at your location. - [Man] Central control, we've lost visual. [reporters talking over each other] - [Reporter] Hardin may be on the loose right now but in the city where the online betting community never sleeps, it's surely only a matter of time until odds of his recapture become pretty. - [Woman] Curfew, this is curfew. - [Woman] Intimate details of Hardin's existence.

Watch him 24-7 and even visit Panopticon TV. Drama's never been so real. [chaotic echoing] [intense music] [bell tolling] [pensive music] - The fighting man. You know what you're worth right now? [bell dinging] [bashing] [bashing] [thudding] [zapping] - [Nash] Hardin. [Hardin groaning] - Going blonde? Platinum really. Think this is gonna get you past face recognition, gate recognition, iris scanners, barcodes, tattoos, chips. Nielsen, the woman who runs the jails is planning on rolling the system out to a whole new town. Officially the prison overflow. Unofficially, it's the expansion of Prison TV. Only more interactive. You're her prize draw. People listen to you. If you told them to stop working, they would. If you told them not to tune in to the town, they would. You can't hide, Hardin. You know that much at least. We gotta go, good luck. - [Woman] Curfew, curfew. - [Woman] Download his playlist and the films he likes. Loyalty customers get access to the felon app which allows you to adopt your very own felon. Watch him 24-7. [sighing] - Hey, it's me, it's Nash. Hardin. - Quick, day of birth! - 7/7/2029. - Our day of birth! - 7/7/2019. - Birthmark. - Red line inner thigh. An octopus has three hearts. A man and a dog are always faithful. Then one will come in handy. Jesus Christ, well you know if you let me visit you every once in a while you might fucking recognize me. Parker wanted you up on the screens instructing the masses. I wasn't gonna let that happen. Just went along with it to get you out. You ever wonder why you didn't make parole? Why you did more than your 10 years? These bastards were never gonna let you out. So we cut you out. Right under her nose. But this, bruv. I think these will be more use. They're lenses. They can get you past the sensors. First thing is to lift those fingerprints, lose your tattoo, anything identifiable. Yeah, you should change the way you walk too. But once that's all sorted, you'll finally be free. You know, you can do what you like. You know there was a time when I, I thought you'd never make it out. I didn't know what to do. - They get to me, they get to you. - [Nash] They're not gonna get to you, that's what I'm saying. We can protect you. - I'm on every screen. - You'll be safe with us. We got a lot of catching up to do, you know? - What's beyond this city? - Favela town. You'll never make it past the perimeter. It's where they burn the trash. - I can't stay here. - You got no place else to go. The places with symbols, that means that surveillance has been cut. And follow the hobo code, lead you to food. If you get stuck out there, there's a guy named Perelman. He's the closest thing you'll find to somebody you can trust. He moves around the outskirts of Favela town. Don't fuck up. [tense music] - ID, sir. - Oh dang. - [Woman] The RFID chip is painless and totally free. Imagine an end to those fines for forgetting your card. No more debt and with less to remember, you can spend more time with your. [somber music] [grunting] [grunting] [tense music] [machinery whirring and beeping] [static] [light piano music] [garbled echoing voice in background] - Hi. I'm Mathison. We're not gonna hurt you. We just want you to answer a few questions truthfully. When you're done, you can go. Now if you don't answer these questions truthfully then you can't go. Are you Mallory Burnham, leader of the Central Authority from 2014 to 2019? - Yeah. What, what are you doing? - [Mathison] Just thought I'd do some of the questions from the citizens that you fucked over. Don't bother trying to escape. There's no stairs. - Jesus Christ. - Just an elevator shaft with no elevator. - I'm hungry. - Most people can last five days on just their fatty deposits. I'll say you're good for at least two weeks. - I am swift. You let me go immediately, I can make this a whole lot easier on you. - It's easy now. - How many hits? - Um, it's not about hits so much as conversions. - Just give me a number. - 77 million. - Take it down, can't you just take it down? - It just gets posted again. - Are we any closer to bringing these fuckers in or what? - We've narrowed down the location of the court to Division 17 near district six, and if we-- - Court, this isn't a court. This is a bunch of veggie hackers with a misplaced sense of their own importance. - [Man] They have some influence. - Well, you can call them influences if you want but I'm gonna stick to domestic terrorists. What more do you guys need? We have kidnap, vandalism, robbery, extortion. - We can't get them on robbery. They didn't empty the banks. - No, they only announced which banks were going to be emptied. The customers took their own money out. - Plus they're only collapsing the grid from 1700 to 1800 hours so people get to leave work early which is proving to be pretty popular. - Oh good, well I'm glad that's popular. - At a cost of 11 billion wan a day. - I want every kid on every building and anyone with a mask, a spray can or a tool belt under the age of 30, I want them rounded up and I want them databased. And make up a clause if you have to! And bring their mothers in too. [whooshing] [tense music] [intense music] [siren sounding] [birds chirping] - Hey! Who are you? Go ahead, I'm not greedy. - It's big of you, it's a fucking trash can. - What's your name? Make one up, so I don't have to call you bum. [sighing] - Hardin. - I think I like bum better. Julius. One thing I love about the river, never changes. Doesn't matter who fucks you over, the river stays the same. I used to be a teacher. Now, all the kids learn online. What was your line? - Advertising. - Hmm, Hardin your real name? - Yep. - You from the orphanages? Yeah, sounds like an orphanage name. There are rules, okay? No phones, no chips. Nothing that can pick up GPS. That means no TVs, radios or I-anythings. And no swearing. Beyond that, I don't care what you've done or who you've done it to. You hurt anyone here, I'll hurt you. You got it? - Got it. - Everybody. This is Hardin. I pulled him out from the trash. [light music] [clacking] - No doubt you must have noticed a small flicker of excitement when you turned up. We don't get a lot of entertainment around here, you know. You know, life expectancy on this street is 37. Gotta make the most out of your time on earth, right? What do you think? [somber music] [cheering] - Want me to take a watch? - You? - Yeah. - We're watching for you. It'll get around that you're here and then people will come. So we'll have to move you. And if more come, we'll have to move you again. We'll keep you safe. You're family now. But it's best if you stay out of sight. [sighing] - Okay, assuming our own research is accurate that over a third of this country's most successful businesses pay zero tax, and 98 percent have offshore resources, this figure here is how much tax is owed at any one time. The goal is to find some nut figure at which they won't-- - 96.7 percent? The Laffer curve. - How'd you know about that? - Because when I was your age, you were being born. He has a point. - [Michelle] Okay, don't tell me you're actually thinking of listening to them. That would be political suicide. - [Charles] These kids are 15, 16, 22 tops. We were born in the last century. We don't have a hope of thinking like them. - [Michelle] Are you smoking weed? - [Charles] All I'm saying is they're not idiots. - [Michelle] And neither I hope, are we. - Prisoner Barca, sir. [door shutting] - So you read our manifesto. - My people did. They said the spelling was atrocious. - Well it was about communication, not education. We were communicating. So I'm sure your people report on your ratings. You know what Newtown is? See Nielsen puts a chip that controls your electronical impulses off your brain. Maybe you have one. Maybe that's why you go along with everything she suggests. Or maybe you're just fucking-- - There can't just be anarchy. - And it can't just be social control. I mean where is it gonna stop? You can keep rounding us up but we'll keep coming out of the woodwork. 'Cause we've got nothing to lose. We are the future. [machine beeping] - [Alexandra] Any luck? - No. He'll have changed his appearance by now. The amount of fights he's had, he'd easily have reset his nose, his cheekbones. Face checkers won't find him that easily. And maybe he's been used enough. - Meaning? - Maybe he's entitled to a bit of R and R. - And who do you think is going to tune in to Newtown if Hardin Jones fails to show? What do you think I'm doing this for? Because I like watching felons? - Some felons. - George, we're overrun with criminals. Someone has to take responsibility, I did. I found a way to fund the jails and the voters like that. - I'm just saying, maybe he doesn't want that. - What do you know about what he wants? - I don't. But how do you think he's gonna feel when he finds out what you've done to him? - He killed someone. - Someone who attacked his brother. - Did he get the death penalty, no. He got famous. - Right. So maybe you could do it to someone else. - Now that's a good idea. - [Reporter] Nash, what kind of things can a felon expect here in Newtown? - Give you money. - [Reporter] They give you a house, right? - Play in the casino. - [Reporter] Oh my god, I should commit a crime. - I want a car. - [Reporter] You've become a big star like your brother Hardin. How does that make you feel? - [Reporter] Nash Jones, brother of Hardin. Will he pass or will he fail?

Will he take the money, will he steal the car, will he rape the girl? Will he rape the girl? - [Hardin] No. - Then he'll fail. In order to pass, you have to conform to the will of the group. Conformists are easiest to control. Nash has a chip in his throat. - [Hardin] How are you getting me in there? - If you go into Newtown, the subscribers will follow. Consumerism will go through the roof and Nielsen will get the hit that she needs. - So? - So you have to be sure you care more about Nash than you do your newfound anonymity. - How long you been watching me? - Since I needed you. - Needed me for what? - To bring down Newtown. If Newtown's a success, Nielsen will roll it out even bigger. The whole city maybe. 10 million cameras, 20 million consumers, all trackable. And eventually, controllable.

The town must destroy itself. The attraction that is you need to be seen to be eliminated. Do you want your anonymity back? Come on, that's gotta be worth dying for. Map. Card for the door.

Maybe he'll join his brother Nash in Newtown, play at the casinos, win the cool car. Meet beautiful girls, you can help him decide and one day, the choice will be yours. Panopticon TV, drama's never been so real. [crowd faintly shouting] - Hardin. There's no way I would ever have hurt you or your brother. I was trying to improve things for you. Newtown would have given you a way out, give you back your freedom for good. It was the advertisers that didn't want to let you go. Because you're different. Why do you think everyone tuned in, it was because of you. I'm only trying to make things better for people who have nothing. People like you, me and Nash. What hope have they got? And you, you never have to worry about money. That's freedom. I gave you that. - You gave me that? - I made you a star. Isn't that what everyone wants? We could make a great difference together, you and me. We could make a great team. We're not that dissimilar, are we? - We couldn't be any more different, you and I. Do you know what it is to really love someone, someone you'd kill for, someone to go on living for? - [Alexandra] Yes I do. You can have anything you want. [beeping] [buzzing] - Hmm.

Following the success of Prison TV, Jones became the world's most downloaded felon used to advertise anything from t-shirts to jeans. It's estimated his loss could cost the prison service as much as 15 trillion. - Any chance of putting her in jail? - [Charles] They'd rip her to pieces. - Christmas special. - [Charles] You want a drink? - Ah, rain check. My son's gotten himself into the finals of some video game championship and tonight's my night, so. - [Charles] I hope he wins. - He always wins. See you on Monday?
