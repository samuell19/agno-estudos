Lessons are starting at a home for rescued baby chimps in Liberia, West Africa. Jimmy and Jenny Desmond started with two chimps and now they have 21, all rescued from the illegal pet trade. They, and their team of caregivers, are working round the clock to look after them all. But with new chimps arriving all the time, taking care of them is becoming quite a challenge. Oh, they're pulling your skirt down. LAUGHTER They need to find them a new home in the forest, where they can lead a more natural life. I'm Professor Ben Garrod. A biologist, chimpanzee specialist, and long-time friend of the Desmonds. This is not normal chimp behaviour. We don't do the wheelbarrow like that. Wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow. As these babies have no mothers to learn from, I'm here to teach them how to live like wild chimps. They're going to love it. Yeah? Yeah, I think they're going to be psyched. Over the next 12 months... Go and play, little fella. ..we'll be showing them how to climb... ..how to forage for food... I was going to say, we're going to try and see if they can nut crack, but Lucy's... She's a pro. ..and who to avoid. Max is playing with a deadly snake. So he will be dead. Yeah, and that's as scary as it is. Yeah. With the house full to bursting, the pressure is on to find them all a new home, and get the chimps ready for life in the forest. Ah, geez. Is that really necessary? Bridge of doom! I've come to Liberia in West Africa, on a very unusual mission. I'm here to see a couple of friends of mine, Jimmy and Jenny, who came to Liberia a couple of years ago for something completely different. But once they got here, they found themselves somehow responsible for a couple of chimpanzee babies, and then a few more and a few more. Now they've got 20, 21. Sounds exhausting, so I'm here to help. I'm heading to a small village called Charlesville, roughly 70 kilometres from Liberia's capital, Monrovia. OK, I'm getting more excited now. Here we are. Well, there's dogs, there's people and there's chimps. I think we're in the right place. Jimmy! DOGS BARKING Hello, hello, guys. Hello! Oh, my God. How are you doing? Hiya, man! So awesome to see you. Seriously. Sorry, it's been way too long. This is Gola. Look at the family. Hello. Yeah, we've had 21 children since we saw you. It's so good to see you. She likes to hang upside down. Does she? I miss this so much. It's been like, what? I met the Desmonds a decade ago on another chimp project. Jimmy's a wildlife vet, and when he and Jenny first came here, someone brought them two orphaned chimps to look after, and they couldn't say no. Then they started to get more, and now they're responsible for 21 chimpanzees. Watch out, you're not going to like Gloria, sweetie. Gogo, be nice. Let me just introduce you to everyone. Yeah. So, this is Max. Max, say hi. I've heard so much about you, Max. Yeah, Max is a cuddler. Hello. And he's crazy. So these two are the most scared, because they're the youngest. Are you going to go see him? You can go see him. Beautiful, who's this again? That's Ella. Ella. How about you? You doing OK, baby? There you go. It's like an overload, there's so many people, chimps and dogs. And this is only some of them. It's normal. Yeah. None of this is normal. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally normal. I've always been fascinated by chimpanzees. They're our closest living relatives, sharing around 98.6% of our DNA. Like us, they have complex emotions. And they even laugh when they're tickled. When you work with chimps, or you study chimps or you spend any time with chimps, it's really clear just how similar we are to them. We share culture, we share a very high level of intelligence. They have a sense of humour, they laugh, they mourn, they have a theory in mind, they recognise their own place in the world around them. And physically as well, OK, we look a little bit different, but they've got the same number of fingers and toes and their bones are very similar. And even little things, like their fingerprints, they have unique fingerprints, just like we do. Like human babies, chimpanzees form strong bonds with their mothers. But every chimp here has seen their mum killed in front of them, to be eaten as bushmeat. The babies are then sold as pets. The lucky ones end up here with Jimmy and Jenny. A lot of these guys come with injuries from the hunter. Someone kills the mum and usually they're carrying the baby, so a lot of guys actually have, like, shotgun pellets. Just, every time, it seems sweet, it seems fun, they seem cute. But there's a really sad story behind everyone. No-one here has got a happy story behind them. No, that's the thing. Every guy you see here, it's a tragedy. Like, they've all been through a really traumatic experience. And they shouldn't be here. No. They should be in the forest with their family. You know, that's where they should be. And we're just trying to give them the best life we can, considering the circumstances that they've been put in, you know? It's just, it's just tragic. Yeah. The main goal of the sanctuary is to help the chimps overcome their trauma. To do that, the orphans have a dedicated team of carers, who replace their parents and look after them round the clock. Daniel, this is our friend Ben. Ben, this is Daniel. He's one of our other caregivers. How are you? And this is Eddie, he's also a caregiver. This is Ben. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Well, you have a lot of animals to care for? Yes. Yeah, we love the animals. Yeah, these guys are great. Yeah. I love them. They're family, aren't they? It's the truth! At the moment, Jimmy and Jenny are paying for everything with their own money. As well as the eight babies at the house, there's a further 13 older chimps at another facility a few hundred metres down the road. Come on, crazy face. The whole place feels like it's bursting at the seams. Do you feel his penis? Mm! Penis in face. You got penis in face. You should feel really good. I don't. I don't want his dinkle in my face! I feel like I've been fully accepted. He's laughing. Chimpanzees in the wild have a home range of up to 65 square kilometres. Oh, boy. Raising 21 chimps in a fraction of that space is proving a huge challenge. CAR HORN BEEPS Be good. One thing that sort of struck me earlier is it's great when there's so much going on, but you must be nearly at the point you can't take many more in. We... I mean, we're way over capacity. We were over capacity at three! ROOSTER CROWS It's the end of the first day and it's been... ..there's no other word, it's been crazy. First day back in Africa. First day seeing Jimmy and Jenny. First day being inundated with a whole bunch of chimps again. And seeing the project, and it's amazing. But it's overwhelming, it's massively overwhelming. At the same time as exciting, as fun, as lovely. So much for you guys to do. The Desmonds' dream is to move all the orphans to a new home in the forest. They've found a patch of land that would be perfect for the chimps, if they can secure it, and we're on our way to take a look. So, Ben, if you look... ..if you look, sort of, behind the mangroves there, you can see those big trees. Yeah, just behind. Yeah. That forest is the land where we want to... where we want to put the sanctuary. Oh, really? Yeah. It's perfect. It's really ideal. The proposed site stretches over 100 acres of forest. Surrounded by mangroves and a river, a natural barrier for the chimps. And they'll just be like wild chimps. As close to the wild as they can ever be and it looks... it looks perfect. Yeah. This hundred acre wood could be the solution to all their problems. A promised land for them and the chimps. And for right now, it's... it's going to be fantastic. If we can really secure the land and get the funding we need to have the land. You guys must be so excited, I mean, I am excited, but you must be so excited seeing this right now. I'm so excited. Your new home, your new project. Their new home. I'm so excited. All I can do is just imagine my babies going up... You know, the day we get out there... ..in the trees. ..it's going to be awesome. I'm so, so excited. Those little guys are going to be so psyched. Jimmy and Jenny have given themselves 12 months to build the sanctuary. Before they can move, the chimps must learn how to survive in their new environment. And that's where I come in. She's got teeth now. She's got teeth. Over the next year, I'm going to be returning here every couple of months to help prepare the chimps for their new life in the forest. I think my role in chimp school is a little bit like one of the teachers, I guess. From my background, I've mainly worked with wild chimps and I know exactly what they should and can do in the wild. When some of these little chimps are coming in, they can't even climb. They're...they're absolute babies. We've had to teach them. We've had to teach them the same way their mums would teach them. It's going to sound weird, but I'll be developing lesson plans. So, it'll be termite fishing or nut cracking or building a nest. Identifying venomous animals or harmless animals. Chimp school is going to put them through their paces. But it's going to teach them the skills they'll need to go back into the wild. Time for school, guys. Come on. Come on, time for school. It's time to start our lessons. Our first class is teaching the chimps to recognise danger. Liberia has more than a dozen species of venomous snakes. For a baby chimp, the world is a deadly place. And things like this could be the endgame for them. So, the scary thing is they don't intrinsically or instinctively know that a snake can be deadly. In the wild, they'd have mum and brothers and sisters, and the whole rest of the group would alarm call and scream and throw sticks at them. I'm really interested to see what happens when they come across a deadly snake whilst they're playing. I've got no idea what they'll do. Starting with a baby group, our students this morning are one-year-olds Max and Bui, and Poppy and Ella, who are just a few months old. Max sees it, right? First up is Max, the alpha male of the baby group. Oh, look, look, look. Here they go. Right now, Max, that is perfect. Max is playing with a deadly snake. There you go. He's playing with it, so he would be dead. Yeah. And that's as scary as it is. Yeah. He has no fear that... No. ..he has no idea that that's something that could be dangerous. He's very confident. We need to teach Max that anything shaped like a snake could be dangerous. So, in the wild, Mum would have screamed... Yes. ..by default. The kids learn whatever it is is bad, don't go near it. Yes. They don't have that here, I guess, do they? Like us, chimps have their own language, but as their surrogate parents, we need to teach them how to make the alarm call. JENNY HOWLS LIKE A CHIMP That seemed really intense, but that's exactly what a mum would do in the wild. Instantly, watching his little face there, he didn't care. The moment you made the noise, he responded and came straight to safety. Let's put it here again or point it kind of toward him and see what he does. Yeah, they're all looking right now. They're already talking about it. Yeah, I can hear them. They see the snake. They're now scared of the snake. Bui is catching on quickly. He climbs up the nearest tree to get away from the snake, and keeps a watchful eye on it. He's really like, "I gotta get off the ground." The ground is scary. He's watching everything you're doing very carefully. Bui? Yeah. Good. Bui's already graduated this lesson. Yeah. Are you ready, Max? The next step is to get the snake moving. So, Max is helping me pull right now, which is not ideal. But let's see what happens, Max. THEY HOWL This time, Max and the others stay away. But it all proves a little too much for Bui. BUI SHRIEKS OK, OK. Everybody's safe. Everybody's safe. Everybody's safe. Everybody's safe. Good girl. OK, Max is now wary, Jenny. Max is wary. Finally. I guess this is the thing, not all kids learn at the same rate either. No, he's...he's very brave. He's very confident. He understands it's scary. MAX PANTS He's making little scary sounds. He went from completely playing with a toy and now he won't let it come near him. Yeah, that is really impressive. That's great. I know it looks horrible and it sounds horrible... But that's great. ..but that's saving his life. It's as simple as that. He'll never go near a snake again. No. That's it. Instantly, that was, "Away with it." Good job. Good, that's so good. The lesson will be repeated until they've all learned to recognise a snake and raise the alarm. Right, sweetie. It's OK, come here. The work doesn't stop, even when the day is over. OK, kidaroodoos. Come on, Maxy. Max, come on. Going to bed. Come on, buddy. Come on. Bedtime. Do the bottles. There you go. In the wild, baby chimps sleep attached their mothers for the first year or so of their lives. Maxy, come here. So the Desmonds are trying to do the same. So, do these four sleep in here with you? Yes, they do. How's that? How is that? That's a good question. It can be challenging at times. You shouldn't complain, because they sleep on me. Sure. Come on, Prince. Up, up. Up, up. Come here. BOTH: Good girl. Yeah. That's four baby chimps. Two or three dogs. Yeah. And you two. Yeah. There you go. Normal bedtime routine at the Desmonds'. Yeah. This is it. This isn't ideal for you guys. No, this isn't ideal, and they shouldn't be here. Just like everything that we're doing here, it's a double-edged sword. This is really nice to have this time with them and have this comfort and nurturing, but no, they shouldn't be here. I mean, they should be nurtured and comforted with their real moms. Yeah. In a nest, at the top of a tree in the forest. I mean, you know, like when they're this young, like, they're attached to their mom, like, 24 hours a day. Yeah, of course. So, this is kind of physical contact is super important for their wellbeing and their development. And so... Yeah, they need this touch. Yeah. I mean, the other option would be that they slept on their own, we put them to sleep, and then we just left them. But we don't feel like that's OK, because that's not natural for them and we want them to always feel safe and secure. Yeah. 24 hours a day. Yeah. You know? ROOSTER CROWS For the Desmonds, the day starts around 5am, when the babies wake up. You're getting yours, buddy. Sorry, I don't have three hands. I'm not an octopus. Very normal, every morning, usually one of the first things Max does is he goes up on this windowsill and he goes to the bathroom. Yesterday, he woke me up by peeing on my head. Which wasn't really very pleasant. This morning, we're doing a special lesson for the smallest chimps. Some were taken from the forest when they were so young, they haven't yet developed the motor skills they need. So we're going to help them. All right, ready? Yeah. We've just received a donation from the local UN office. And it's perfect for baby chimps to learn to climb. You know, the UN has been here for a number of years because of the civil war. Yeah. And they're finally shutting down their operations. So, there's a lot of free stuff... Awesome. ..going around. So we're trying to get as much as we can. So, we've got a cargo net. We've got a cargo net. I'm going to climb up. I'm not built for this, Jimmy. I'm not going to lie. They're going to love it. Yeah? Yeah, I think they're going to be psyched. Oh, look, here comes Bui. Go play, little fella. In the wild, chimps spend roughly half their time up in the trees. They forage, hunt and even sleep in them. Climbing may seem like an innate ability, but they actually have to learn it. There you go. Bui, Bui! This whole idea that a wild animal is just born wild is rubbish, really. There's a really interesting, quite poignant example, where a group of sort of small monkeys from South America were reintroduced back into the wild and they were falling out of trees, they were dropping to the floor and nobody knew why. And it turned out that where they'd been bred, all of the branches, all of the flooring was solid. And here they were, back in the wild suddenly, on branches that would bounce and spring and snap and they didn't know how to climb. That just goes to show if we have to teach these little chimps how to walk on branches, then there's a long road ahead. Maxy. What do you think, pal? Max isn't interested in the climbing lesson, and as usual, would rather be making mischief. I'm really surprised by Max. He was my sure favourite to jump around and mess about on the climbing frame. Max. But he's not, he's over there and he's playing with loo roll and making a den nest for himself. Oh, boy. Max? Is that really necessary? Of the four babies, the star pupil in today's lesson is little Ella, the youngest of all the orphans. She's so impressive. She's so little and she... Ohh! But she's...she's really trying, isn't she? Look at this. The biggest surprise to me is little Ella. She's the youngest, she's the least qualified to do this, but she's just going for it. This is a really important time for Ella, because she should still totally be with Mum, but instead, she's really confident. She's really independent, as well. And she's all puffed up, look at her. She's all puffed up, she's doing really brave stuff. And you check back in! Check-checking. Oh, and a smile! A smile. You're so proud of yourself, aren't you? I'm proud of you, too. Very, very cute baby chimpanzee. But the reality is never very far away and she's... ..she's a traumatised little kid. And to get here, her mum was... was shot. And we know she was shot, because... ..unbelievably... ..little Ella's got bullet marks. Shrapnel wounds in her arm. And this one here has gone all the way through from that side to that side, and even the bone is all twisted and broken. It's healed now, isn't it? So, that's the reality of baby chimps in sanctuaries. They've all got a horrible story behind them. And there's so much care and love that needs to go into making sure she's well adjusted now. And that's it. We shouldn't have to be here cuddling and nurturing and playing with these baby chimps, they should be in the wild. Ella's mother is just one of thousands of wild chimpanzees killed by hunters for their meat. In the last 25 years, chimp numbers in this part of Africa have plummeted by 80%. They're now classified as critically endangered. Hunters go into forests and just shoot whole groups of chimps. These little chimps are taken when these adults are shot and rather than eat them, because it's not worth much on the market, they're sold as pets and they can make 100, 200, 300 pounds or dollars. It doesn't sound much, but it's a lot here. It's a terrible thought that... ..one of our closest living relatives might be gone, because of us. Keeping chimpanzees as pets is fairly common in Liberia. Although it's officially illegal, most people are unaware of the law. The great thing is that now Jimmy and Jenny are here and have the sanctuary, for the very first time, they can go out and actually rescue chimps held captive in Liberia. But with that comes, like, a load of different risks and...and... ..a sense of unpredictability. I mean, they're going out there into communities and they don't know how the people will react, they don't know how the chimps will react, how old they are, what stresses there might be. It's...it's dangerous. But, yeah, it's a big step forward. Jenny has been called out to a nearby town to help rescue a pet chimpanzee, after receiving a tip off from a member of the public. Jenny is going to be handling the chimp, backed up by a team of police and officers from the Forestry Development Authority. Let's go. OK. This is the chimp we're going to confiscate. You can see in the picture he has a very, very thick chain tied around his neck. Basically, he's a prisoner and he didn't commit a crime. Every time you confiscate a chimp - total unknown. No idea what trauma he's been through, whether he's even going to like me or not like me, if he's not going to like anybody. So, it's kind of scary going into these situations. CHIMP SHRIEKS IN THE DISTANCE I see the baby. OFFICIALS SPEAK IN OWN LANGUAGE JENNY MAKES CHIMP NOISES You're safe, baby. You're safe, baby. You're getting off this chain. The chimp is a female, roughly three years old, and is owned by a local shopkeeper. The chain is embedded in her neck. It's an extremely heavy chain. How do we take the chain off? I think she knows she's getting out of here. She's definitely not letting go of me. OK, I'm Gola Johnson. I'm from the Forestry Authority. The forestry officials explain to the owner that it's illegal to keep chimpanzees as pets. The authority shall take possession of any wild animal from any person who does not possess a valid permit. Where did you get this chimp? This thing? I got it from Sinoe. From Sinoe. Yeah. So, they killed the mother? Yes. For bushmeat. Yeah, they hunt her. It's all right. It's OK. The owner says she had no idea she was breaking the law. SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE Coming home with me. You're coming home with me. Do you want to come home with me? If the chimp stays here, as she grows, she'll become harder for her owner to control. And get off this chain. We'll get off this chain. Most pet chimps eventually end up being killed. You're coming home. It's just so sad. Who wants more tickling? Who wants more tickling? Who wants more tickling? Feeling really proud of this team for doing this and I'm really relieved that this little girl is going to be off this chain and that she's already laughing, which is a miracle. I'm going to take very good care of her. OK? And you can come and visit her. It's time to hand over the chimp. But the owner can only find the key to one of the padlocks. So the chain has to stay on her neck for now. You want to say bye? Want to say bye? OK. OK. OFFICERS SPEAK OWN LANGUAGE By the time they arrive home to meet the rest of the family, Jenny has given the new chimp a name. Miracle, or Mira for short. Jesus Christ! My God. She came right...right to me. The chain is very heavy. I know. Miracle. Welcome, Miracle. Welcome. See, everybody already loves you. I love you. Everyone already loves you. They do. Yeah, they do. Mira must be kept in her own cage in quarantine for a month, to prevent her from spreading any possible diseases to the other chimps. There you go. What do you think about that chain, right now? She's like, "I'm off the chain. I can do what I want." Are you playing, Peggy? Look at Peggy laughing. She was just looking down for her chain. I know. To pick it up. Yes, she can move around without it. Oh, my gosh. Peggy, I think this is going to be your new friend. Oh, my gosh. She's just laughing. Hi, crazy face. Hi, crazy face. I mean, the chain around her neck obviously caused... She's... I can't... It's hard to assess whether there's a... ..how much of a wound there is, but it's really calloused. Obviously, there's no hair there. And I'm sure it was very uncomfortable. You crazy girl. You silly face. I think her life just improved about 1000%. Soon she's going to integrate with the whole group and... ..she'll be so, so, so much happier. You know? You hate tickles! The stress of how we're going to do this and all that is just so worth it when you do this. I mean, it's like it all goes away. And then you just remember, this is why you're doing it. No matter how scary it is or how nervous you get for the chimps, and you think, we'll just... we'll figure it out, because we have to, and we'll get her to have a good life. Yeah, I think tomorrow I'm going to wake up and be totally stressed out, but for right now, it's pretty cool. Mira will need to be fed and looked after for the rest of her life, which could be up to 70 years. The last thing they need or want are actually more chimps coming in. But the situation that they've created is they are the only place that can take these animals, and they have to keep taking them. The alternative is turning them away and they simply won't do that, and nor should they. These chimps need a home. It's almost an impossible situation. They're just coming in all the time, all the time, all the time. And yeah, they're moving forwards and these incredible plans are just on the horizon now. But they're not there yet and they haven't got the money and they haven't started building, and as close as they are, it seems they're further away than ever right now. Because they need to move more than ever before. Hey, guys, guys, guys. Come on, there's plenty. As the sanctuary fills up, Jimmy and Jimmy are running out of staff to look after the chimps. But the orphans also receive help from a more unexpected source. They share their home with a pack of dogs that have also been rescued and adopted by the Desmonds. What's truly extraordinary is how the dogs bond with the chimps, like a second team of carers. The dogs actually help rehabilitate the traumatised orphans. It is a weird dynamic, Jenny, I'm not going to lie - with you guys, the chimps, the dogs. Yeah, it is. Princess, poor Princess. She's sitting there as the matriarch, right now. She's making sure what's... she's surveying the yard, making sure there's nothing wrong going on, that she needs to check on. Oh, she hears us talking. She knows she's being talked about. Do you hear us? Huh? Queen of the dogs is ten-year-old Princess, who guards the baby chimps and helps them in their healing process. Princess is just such a unique dog. I just... It's truly amazing to me what she came from, being a crazy, unadoptable dog who was going to be euthanized... Really? ..to a treasure. I mean, she's a complete treasure to these chimps, and I mean, honestly, I don't think they would heal the same way, when they came in here, without her. Princess is getting mad at that puppy, because she thinks that puppy is doing something bad to Max. You know, we adopted her years ago and she's travelled, she's lived in nine countries with us, and then we get here and she's like the mother of all the babies. I mean, she protects them, she looks after them, she's super tolerant of them and she'd even, like, do discipline with them, like if they're out of control, chewing each other, if they're biting each other, she'll get in the middle. Yeah. It's really unbelievable. I mean, I never could have predicted it, when we adopted her. Actually, with Princess especially, even if they're scared of the other dogs, they're never scared of her. They totally can sense that she's a safe place and it actually makes it better for them if they're nervous around humans, that she's actually safer to them. And she's so sweet and gentle with them, that it's...it's amazing. I mean, she offers them this whole different thing that we can't offer them, I think. She's like an honorary caregiver. Yeah, she is. She's maybe the top caregiver. I think she's the senior, senior caregiver. My friend, my friend. My good friend. Jack, and you, too. JENNY LAUGHS Don't feel bad, Jack. Nothing personal, Jack. I kiss you. You happy? Hey, guys. Hi. After mixed results with the babies, I've come to teach the snake lesson to some slightly older chimps, along with their caregivers, Annie and Annie. Gola. Gola! She greeting you, OK. Ah, thank you. She greeting you. So, today, I want to do a new lesson for the kids. Yeah, mm-hm. We did it with the babies. It was OK. Not too bad, not too good. We're now going to see if these older chimps were with their parents long enough to know that snakes are dangerous. Now we see what happens. OK. OK, Gola is there. Like little Max in the previous lesson, Gola isn't bothered by the snake and doesn't see it as a threat. So, Gola, you've failed already. We're going to try Gloria. Go ahead. OK. OK, OK. OK. Gloria looks like she may have seen a snake before. This is different. OK. She immediately recognises the danger and raises the alarm. GLORIA HOWLS She's afraid. She knows that danger. We told you. Come on. I'm going to try with RB now. Yeah. RB. Oh. Gloria is warning all the orphans about the imminent threat. Gloria wants to... She's trying to go back to make show. ..Gloria wants to show, yeah. She really... Yeah. It's very dangerous. GLORIA HOWLS She's also trying to prevent the others from going near the snake. I know this looks horrible, but it's good. Yeah, she knows. But it's good. Yeah. It's a good lesson. Here's Leeli again. Go on, Gloria, tell him. She knows that's it now. She will never go near a snake again. Never. They're all afraid to come. Yeah. Did Gloria get ten out of ten? Oh, she 100%. 100%. And the rest? The rest... ..RB, 60. Gola...40. Leeli, 50. Yeah? Yes. But Gloria got 100%. Yeah. 100. Yeah. As with the younger chimps, lessons will be continued until all the orphans are scared of snakes. Mira, who was rescued from her life on a chain, has reached the end of her quarantine period. Today, she's getting her first lesson in how to socialise. But first, Jimmy and Jenny need to get her into the car. Let's just... I'll walk... you'll get her out, we'll walk over. I'll open the door, you get in, then she's in the car. Then I get in the other side. She's not going to run away from you. She might, she'll just get out. Well, then we'll have to chase her in. She's going to meet all her... her new family, basically. Just a couple of them at first. The extended family. She's meeting a couple, you know, distant cousins. You going to come out, little girl? Are you going to come out, little girl? OK. It's very exciting. I know. Yeah, it's exciting, huh? Oh, my gosh. Look how excited she is. OK. You go to the car. OK. Mira, Mira! Told you. Who's that crazy? Come on. Who's that crazy girl? Good girl! Guys, Mira's out. Just so you know. Mira. Oh, boy, stop. Come here, Mira. Come here. Come here, Mira. Come on, Mira. Oh, you. You crazy girl. As they become older, chimps become increasingly hard to control. They don't really do as they're told... Come on, Mir-Mir. ..and there's not much you can do about it. Mira, look! Mira. Come on, you silly girl. OK, all right. Yeah, we're going. Let's go. Chimps are highly social animals. When Mira was held in captivity, she had no contact with other chimps. So, this first step is crucial for her development. They're going to meet such a special girl. That's your new family. That's your new family. They're waiting for you. Thank you, Rosabel. This has to be handled carefully. Chimps can be very territorial, and interactions like this can quickly become violent. Yeah, that's crazy Portia. That's crazy Portia. Portia, Mira's pretty crazy, too. This is your new family. What do you think, Mira? That's Annie. Hi, Lulu! That's Lucy. You're a silly girl. You silly face. You silly face! She's like, "There's new chimps." Like, "This is a real family of chimps." This is a real family of chimps, isn't it? Yeah, guys, isn't she beautiful? Hey, Win-Win. That's your new sister. Hi, Win. I don't know, you think about where she was a few months ago. On a chain, living in a village, attached to a cement block, and now she's...she's with these guys. Yeah, isn't she beautiful? OK, let's get Rudy and Lucy out. The first signs are encouraging, so they decide to introduce her to a couple of the chimps. Three-year-olds Rudy and Lucy are two of the most gentle chimps in the group. Want to go see? Come on, guys. Hi, my babies! Gentle, Mir-Mir. It seems Mira needs to work on her social skills. Yeah, I'll be here at the door for them. Mira, gentle. Whoa, she's rough! She's very rough. She doesn't know how to socialise. That's why they might have to have the escape route. Right. She's going to have to learn not to do that. Yeah. This girl is skipping. Lucy's happy. Lucy's like, "This is great." Rudy's a little nervous. You scared? Poor Rudes. Hi, beautiful boy. Oh, poor thing! THEY LAUGH Rudy's scared. She's a little bit crazy, isn't she, for a guy like you? A quiet guy like you. Mira doesn't understand acceptable chimp behaviour. But Rudy has learned how to comfort like a wild chimp... Rudy, sweetie, Rudy... Aw! He's giving her hugs. He's a good boy. ..by embracing. Aw! Aw! You nice guy, Rudes. Rudy, you're so sweet. So sweet. You know, she hasn't been around chimps this size in a while. And she's big. And she's... And she's strong. So she was... I think she was a little nervous. So she was kind of playing a little rough. But now she's just... They're just playing. There we go. There you go. Oh, you big crazy. Absolutely. This is... It's just great. It's perfect. They're getting along. They're having fun. Mira's laughing. Good man! Who is these people? Huh? What is this big boy doing? What we'll do is we'll, um, over the next few days, we'll introduce different members of the group to her in here, in this sort of controlled environment, and then, I don't think it'll take long, then - fairly shortly after that, we'll be able to put her into the big group. Watch out. Oh, you! Over the next few weeks, Mira is introduced to the rest of the chimps and gradually starts to settle into her new life. What a goofball. Isn't it funny? LAUGHTER Mira! Mira! Oh, hello! Hello! I haven't seen you for a while. Look at you. Oh, you're a hairy, happy little chimp again. Look at you. She's lovely. Lovely. I love her. Yeah? She's so different. Really? So you feel like she's your... Family. Part of your family? Mm-hm. Aw! The scars from the chain around her neck are starting to heal. But it's nearly better. Yeah. The hair's nearly all back. Nearly there. It's so good to see Mira like this. She looks so happy. She's got a fat little tummy, so she's obviously healthy. She's still not quite with all the other chimps yet. She's still with Annie and the other caregivers. She's still a little bit nervous, but that's understandable. She's got a way to go, but she's adjusting so well. Hey. With Mira, there are now 17 orphans in the big enclosure, and it's getting overcrowded. The strain is starting to show. CHIMPS SCREECH There's no escaping the fact that pressure's mounting. Tempers are getting frayed sometimes. I'm seeing... ..seeing these chimps finding it harder to be in a small area. And they just need to move to this forest. They can't have many more chimps coming in. Stop! Stop! Progress on the sanctuary has stalled. It's going to cost around half a million pounds, and finding donors is taking longer than expected. What keeps me up at night, besides the three chimps in my bed, is whether we're going to raise the money in time to get out of here. Getting them to a better place and space is...is just... It's... We're in a dire situation at this point. Every day, you wake up thinking, we've got to raise the money, we've got to stay on the timeline, we've got t get out of here, we've got to get to our forest. Thanks for the help, Bui. Great assistance there. It's not just the move that's under threat. Just keeping this place going now costs around £8,000 a month, and the Desmonds are running out of funds. Some people have been donating, but the bulk of it has been our own money that we're using to care for the chimps, to pay for the staff, to pay for everything. Huh? Like those tomatoes? Crazy face. If we had to, we'd spend everything we have, like, trying to help the chimps. Let's go. Chimpanzees live 50-60 years in captivity. We're going to keep getting more. So that's a little worrying. HE CHUCKLES You know what I mean? Like, it's... We're not wealthy people. So, um, eventually that is an unsustainable model, let's put it that way. Yeah, sometimes, we feel like we're sort of in over our heads, basically. But if we walked away right now, I mean, I don't know what would happen. So we can't, you know, that's the thing. We can't. We can't just walk away. One of the things I love most about Jimmy and Jenny is this never-ending optimism. They really are incredible for that. What they're trying to do is huge. And there is... there is a chance it might not happen. That number in their household is always going to increase, and... ..that can't keep going on, and that's starting to worry me. To us, it's personal. You know, we know these guys. We know... I mean, Max, Bui... They're sort of like our kids in a way. We love them, we care about them. And we want the best for them. It's just a lot of work and it's stressful and it's challenging, but we're up to it and we're not stopping. Next time... ..the orphans learn to use tools. Don't think you've got the idea of this yet, have you? Put it in your mouth, Bui. Your mouth! Ugh! I have been worried about him. CHIMP COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS Oh! A potentially deadly cold breaks out among the babies. We did have one chimp who got it very quickly and he ended up dying. The chimp's really scared. Really, really scared. I think you guys maybe stay back. And with new chimps arriving all the time... CHIMP SCREECHES ..things start to get out of hand. Oh, BLEEP! MAKES GURGLING SOUNDS Lessons are starting at a home for rescued baby chimps in Liberia, West Africa. Whoa! LAUGHTER Come on, Maxy! Bedtime, goofballs! Jimmy and Jenny Desmond and their team of carers now have 24 chimps - all rescued from the illegal pet trade. Now, they're going to wreck everything. Oh, they're pulling your skirt down. But with new chimps arriving all the time, looking after them is becoming a real challenge. HORN TOOTS They want to move them to a new sanctuary in the forest, where they can live a more natural life. I'm Professor Ben Garrod, a chimpanzee specialist, and I'm here to help prepare the orphans for their new home by teaching them how to live like wild chimps. LAUGHTER This is not normal chimp behaviour! Wouldn't do the wheelbarrow like that. Wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow! The one-year-olds have already started to learn how to recognise danger. CHIMP: Whoo! Oh! That's great. That's saving his life. He'll never go near a snake again. Never. Our newest arrival, Mira, who was rescued from a life in captivity... There we go. There we go. ..has been learning to socialise. They're getting along. They're having fun. Mira's laughing. Now the pressure's on to move them to the forest... ..before things get out of hand. CHIMP SCREECHES Oh! BLEEP. Picky's biting me, I've got Max biting me. I've got Bui biting me. Is this bite Ben day? No. No! HE LAUGHS I'm back in Liberia after a three-month break to carry on my lessons with the rescue chimps. No! Smile! It's amazing to see just how much the orphans have grown up. Is this Ella? Yeah. Ella's so big! Good girl. Look at you! You were a baby the last time I saw you. You were a baby. A little baby. One of the things that fascinates me most as a scientist with chimps is that when you look into the eyes of a chimp, there's someone, not something, looking back. Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives - sharing around 98.6% of our DNA. They're astonishingly human. Right, you two, that's enough. That's enough. You're seeing personalities, you're seeing intelligence, you're seeing problem-solving. Good boy! And then, often, you think what a funny sense of humour with some of these guys, as well. Good job, Gloria. It's very clean now. This is... This is... This is very... LAUGHTER Which one's this? This is Max. It's like being back with kids, with old friends, with family. It's like a weird family reunion. Yeah. For example. Yeah. My old friends Jimmy and Jenny Desmond have become parents to a growing family of baby chimpanzees. Good girl. Jimmy is a wildlife vet working on a research project in Liberia. OK, baby. You're all right. Good girl. When he and his wife Jenny came here two years ago, they were given two baby chimps to look after. As chimps here are critically endangered, they felt unable to turn them away. And, ever since then, people have been bringing them more. To take any baby chimpanzee that you see anywhere - in a sanctuary, or someone's house, or someone has a pet - it means that someone killed the mother. Like, they might look cute and they might seem all cuddly, but the fact that we have them is a total tragedy. Like, we shouldn't have them. I would much prefer if I'd never met any of these guys and they all were still in the forest with their parents. That's where they should be. While I've been away, three more chimps have arrived. Is that good? Two of them need 24-hour care. No, you're not having that. You can't share bottles. Sorry. Sorry, silly. Sorry, silly. CHIMP CHEEPS You have a funny burp. You have a funny burp. Six-month-old Chance was discovered living on the floor of a bar in a nearby town. MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH Her head was dangerously swollen. Sometimes, the hunters will hit the babies on the head or chop their fingers to get them to let go of the moms, because they don't let go. We found her. She was sitting in a box. She was doing rocking behaviours. A sign of stress, isn't it? Huge stress. Yep. Total stereotypical, like, stress that you see. Like, just back and forth. She had like a dirty blanket that was all she held on to, and if you even started to move the blanket away from her, she would scream. So her blanket was her mom. Yeah. We could feel an actual fracture in her skull, like a huge fracture, which means she was hit from the front. Got to admit, when I saw the photos you sent me, I didn't know whether I'd get to meet you. I know. But here she is. You're right, I didn't, either. And that's amazing. And, who knows? If we hadn't found her... Yeah, of course. I don't know what her future was. She's really, really a miracle. The other new arrival is also a major cause for concern. Gaia is only eight weeks old. Oh. And this one just came in about a week ago. Little Gaia. Hello. Do you want to meet Ben? In the wild, Gaia would be completely dependent on her mother. Is that good? Still unable to lift her head, she'd be carried 24 hours a day and fed on breast milk. You can see she has no teeth. She really is a baby, isn't she? Yeah. Really, really little baby. I've never seen a chimp this close, this young. I know, and, actually, she's the youngest chimp I've ever cared for. She can't even hold on to me yet, so she's not even, like, to that stage. So... My goodness, that must come with so many extra commitments now. It's scary. It's super-scary. Like humans, chimps are complex, emotional animals. After the trauma of seeing their mothers killed, the road to recovery can take time. I have come to the big enclosure where the older chimps live to catch up with Mira, who was rescued six months ago. Annie, how's Mira getting on in the group? Oh, she's fine. She's great. Yeah? She's making friends? Yeah, she's friendly. Mira was being kept as a pet in a nearby town on the end of a heavy chain. Do you want to come home with me? Ah! Amazing to think, just a few months ago, she looked sick. She had that chain. No, no, no. Yes, that's really good to see. Ah, it's so good to see. You can see her, since we first got her - remember, she barely had any hair at all. Yeah. Especially in her neck. It was scarred. Yeah. Now... Look, it's so good. ..it's like almost completely gone. There's still a couple of sores there, but they'll go away. Mira is still a little nervous and spends much of her time in the comfort of the carers. But she's heading in the right direction. With so many chimps, things are getting dangerously overcrowded. The Desmonds want to move all the orphans to the safety of a purpose-built sanctuary in the forest. After some setbacks, plans are now moving forward. They've finally secured the lease on a patch of land, which will be perfect for them and the chimps. And they're taking me to see it. They'll find fruits and trees and leaves and bark and maybe even termites and ants, and maybe even fish. I mean, it's going to be really cool to see what they eat. Ultimately, we'll have, you know, people come visit. We can do eco-tours and a lot of great stuff. I mean, our thing is the chimps - we want them to benefit. But a lot of people benefit, not just the chimps. So I'm looking forward to seeing it. Yeah. The Desmonds' plans for this 100-acre site are ambitious. So, you know, this is...I mean, this is a dream, obviously. Perfect. They want to build quarantine facilities, a nursery and a veterinary centre. I can just imagine now, like, the vet lab here. Staff quarters. It's going to be amazing when it's all up and running. I mean, without this space, we really can't rescue more chimps. We're over capacity. We're well over capacity where we are now. Here we go - into the forest. We're going in, we're going in. Already you can feel it's cooler. I know. It's lovely. Oh, my gosh, so much better in here, huh? Yeah, this is just gorgeous, isn't it? I mean, can you imagine them on the vines? Look at the vines! You can so easily imagine just one of them next to you now, and one up in the canopy and on the ground. I know! I know. Hitting buttresses and throwing leaves around. Some running along down here and some climbing up there, some going across the trees. Signing the lease on this place is a great first step, but it's just the beginning. So we have a lot of work ahead of us. It feels a bit insurmountable. We have to build a sanctuary from the ground up and that is not an easy task. It involves a lot of planning, a lot of design and, most of all, a lot of money. I think, right now, we're looking at a pretty big number of 500,000 that needs to be raised in the next year. I mean, or we won't accomplish what we need to accomplish. Apart from a few donations, the Desmonds currently pay for the whole project from Jimmy's salary. Jenny spends all her spare time looking for more donors to pay for the move. Go play, little fella. In the meantime, I'm preparing the chimps for their new home by showing them how to live in the wild. Chimp school is progressing really nicely, I think. Animals go through an education. We might not call it that in their lives, but they do, and especially the social species like chimps. They're not just born wild, fully equipped with all the skills they need in order to survive in the wild. They have to learn all these things, bit by bit, month by month, or year by year, in many cases. They'll always have the sanctuary there to support them. But if they can live as wild as possible, that's the dream we all want to achieve here. Come on. Today, I'm going to teach the orphans an extraordinary skill. CHIMP CHIRRUPS Where are we going?! Chimps in the wild have passed down this knowledge through generations. They've discovered how to use tools. The most complicated that we know of, so far, is nut cracking, where they'll take a number of different tools and actually use them together to achieve their goal - to actually crack these incredibly hard nuts they can't even use their teeth for. This is going to be a hard task and I'm interested to see whether anyone is able to do this. It takes years - it can take six, seven, maybe eight years, to really refine this in the wild. So I'm not expecting much. Are you going to crack open some nuts? Huh? Maxy! For this lesson, I'll focus on teaching two of the brightest babies - one-year-old Max and two-year-old Bui. Oh, this is very exciting. It takes between six and eight years, apparently, to learn how to actually crack a nut in the right way. You've got to have the right anvil. The right thing you bash it on. The right rock in your hand. I mean, this is too crumbly, this would be rubbish and too small. You don't want something too small or too big - it's got to be just right. For me, that's fine. What do you guys think? Look at this. Like human children, chimps learn by looking and copying. Feeding them a reward should hopefully encourage them to try it. I would love it even if one of these little guys just picked a rock up. That's all I would care right now. Max is really fascinated with it. Yeah, he's really looking. He's really curious about the whole thing. Look! Even that is just... Ah. It's such a slow process and it's such a complicated skill to master. He's thinking about it, though. Clearly, he's, like, he's knocking it like this. Yeah. And he's knocking the rock and he's picking up the rock a little. And then he's pounding your head, which is, you know, fair enough. Like a nut. Agh, Max! Ready, Maxy, ready? Yeah. Oh, look, look. LAUGHTER It doesn't take long for Bui to lose interest. Ah, boy. Hi, crazy face. Oh, now you have all of them. Wow, that's exciting. Well done, Bui. Learning new skills can be very frustrating. Oh! Boo-boo, that wasn't very nice! Nut cracking will take time, and the babies will practise with their carers over the coming weeks. Over at the big enclosure, lessons have already started with the older chimps. And I'm going to see their carer Annie to check on their progress. Where are we going? Are you guys ready? Ready to crack nuts? Mira, who was rescued from life on a chain, has been integrating so well, she's beginning to take part. Good, OK. That's cool. Cracking nuts, yeah. Are you going to do it? Annie wants to show me how Mira is getting along. Cracks. You saw it was the cracking. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Concentration levels are a challenge today. Rude! Mira. Lucy is up next. She's the cleverest in the group. Lucy! I was going to... You smart girl! You smart girl! I was going to say, we're going to try and see if they can nut crack, but Lucy's... Wow! She's a pro. OK. Good girl. Crack, OK. Lucy is proving the model student. That's great. OK. She does it perfectly. Yeah. Like she gets just the nut out. Good girl. Well, this is a super start. How much skill is going into this? It's hand-eye coordination, it's realising what she should be doing. OK! I like how she does that... That's the right amount of force. Yeah. How long did it take for Lucy to learn how to do this? She took about two, two weeks and a half. Two and a half weeks. Wow. In the wild, this takes eight years for the mother, for the auntie, for the grandmother, to teach. Lulu, you smart girl! In the wild, chimps learn from each other, and Lucy's new skills will encourage the whole group to develop their tool use. CLAP OF THUNDER It's the start of the wet season in Liberia. And with the rains comes a deadly threat. CHIMP SNEEZES That's not good. One of the new arrivals is displaying worrying symptoms. So he's come in with a cold and it's probably from the people who kept him before. But even something as simple as a human cold could be deadly. It really could have a huge, devastating impact on a small population like this. So it's something we really have to watch. Oh, buddy! Despite our physiological similarities, chimpanzees have little resistance to many human viruses and diseases. That's a real threat. I mean, having a chest infection, or even a common cold, to them, could rapidly... Well, could kill them. Yeah, it can kill them. I mean, we did have one chimp who got it very quickly and he was only here a few weeks. He came in very, very weak and he stayed very weak and never really progressed to be healthy. And he ended up dying from a severe chest infection that came on in one night - I mean, within hours. We didn't even have time to treat him. Yeah. So, it's scary. It's scary. Of course. It's a real threat and it's scary. Every effort is being made to contain Survivor's cold. But with so many chimps in such a small area, it's impossible to manage. The youngest are most at risk, particularly the new arrival, baby Gaia. Once the forest sanctuary is up and running, then, yeah, there will be incredible quarantine facilities. There'll be a veterinary area. There'll be all the things we need in place, the infrastructure, to make sure there's no chance of disease spread or infection risk. At the moment, the team are doing the best they can, but the money's not here, the facilities aren't here. So we've just got to make sure it doesn't spread. That would be awful. It really would. Despite the problems of overcrowding, the Desmonds can't turn any new orphans away. Chimps in Liberia are critically endangered - in part due to the illegal pet trade. A police unit has been set up to catch the dealers, and Jenny and I have been called out on a rescue operation. We're basically going into an unknown situation. We've been asked to co-ordinate with the Transnational Crime Unit to go and make some confiscations of illegally held wildlife. But we don't know exactly what we're going to find and, I always say, who we're going to find. We know we're going in with armed police into a situation where there might be people who are quite hostile. They might be smugglers. They might be wildlife traffickers. We really don't know and that's quite scary. Yeah, this is a big step into the unknown. The police believe that someone here is selling chimps. Jenny is going to pose as an international buyer to help catch them. We soon find what we're looking for. CHIMP PANTS RAPIDLY Hi, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. The chimp is a female, roughly three years old. Chimps are often killed for bushmeat - a delicacy in Liberia - and their babies then sold as pets. Hello. Hello. She's confident, isn't she? Yeah. What's the chimp's name? What do you call her? Star. Star? She's been on the chain a long time, because she knows every bit of this rock. It's illegal to keep chimps as pets in Liberia - and to sell them. 900 US? Yes. Wow. You think I'm rich? 850? Wow. You're only worth 850, little one. Take him. HE SWITCHES TO OWN LANGUAGE We need to get out. But then comes some unexpected news. An adult, like a big, big one? We're heading to... There's a report of another big chimp - that could be an adult, it could be a slightly larger kid - in the area. And the fear is that now these guys know this first bloke has been arrested for having a chimp, the worry is they'll move this one, or they'll kill this one, or... The problem is, if it is an adult, I don't know what we'll do. We can't... You can't just take an adult chimp. It's three, four times stronger than us. It's really dangerous. Really, really dangerous. How are you? Good. I am nervous. I'm walking through a community that doesn't necessarily want us here. We're coming into their community and arresting people. We need backup from the police station. We're getting backup? Because we don't know what's to going to happen. Are we all right to go in here? Mm-hm. I can... There he is. Over there, Jenny. Under there. Under a trailer. Oh, yeah. Here? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, over there. Yeah. The chimp's really scared. Really, really scared. I think you guys maybe stay back. This chimp's so scared. The chimp's fear is making him aggressive and extremely dangerous to approach. CHIMP SCREECHES It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. The owner arrives to see what's going on. He doesn't like women? CHIMP SCREECHES THROUGHOUT OK. They are giving the chimpanzee gin. It's OK, it's all right, baby. What is his name? Johnny. Johnny. It's OK, Johnny. It's OK, Johnny. It's OK. It's all right. They're definitely adult teeth, aren't they? Yeah. But his body looks like a 6- or 7-year-old. Which you get through malnutrition. The same as us. Malnutrition and alcohol - drinking alcohol. Yeah. We've seen the area. There's lots of bottles everywhere - of gin, on the floor. They've been giving the chimp gin - alcohol - to keep it relaxed. Whisky, gin. Do you give him alcohol? Yeah, once in a while. These bottles? You give him alcohol? This is his? There's loads of them everywhere. What happens when he does something bad? Do you ever hit him? Mm-hm. And that makes him stop doing something? Yeah. OK. It's all right. I'm feeling really sad for this chimp. He's so scared. And he said he's whipping him with a switch and he's drinking alcohol and he's had him ten years. He's lived like this for ten years. It seems the owner doesn't know it's illegal to keep a chimp as a pet and needs some persuading to let Johnny go. THEY SPEAK IN OWN LANGUAGE Watch out for the chimp. It's time to leave - before things get out of control. It's the start of a new life for three-year-old star. And for Johnny. But it means two more chimps for the Desmonds to care for. Johnny is still showing signs of aggression. His arrival poses a major challenge. He looks small. He's dangerous. He could do serious harm to any of us here, right now. So, because of that, we're going to give him a drink. We're using ketamine to knock him down and he'll just gently fall asleep. It's the only safe way of doing this. CHIMP SCREECHES It's OK, it's OK. Sorry, buddy. Johnny is stressed. He liked what you were doing. But he seems to trust project manager Simeon. Just give him some of that into his mouth, see if he'll take it. Took it. Good boy. OK. While we wait with Johnny for the ketamine to take effect... ..upstairs, Jenny is settling Star into her new home. Off! It's done. What do you think? In a matter of two days, we've gotten four new chimps. So, it's insane. And then, of course, we just got an adult boy, Johnny, who we certainly didn't expect and we really don't have capacity for because it's not like these guys, where we can have them in the house. So it's been a crazy few days. I think we should move away, guys. Just... Johnny's stress levels are so high the ketamine is having little effect. The only option is a more powerful dose via intravenous injection. You never quite know what the impact will be on the animal, but also the human safety here, as well. We don't know how he'll react. He could lash out and he could cause damage. He's a strong boy and he's scared. It's not a good combo. JOHNNY SCREAMS No, I didn't get him. We need to move Johnny closer. Slip off... Which means unlocking his chain. Careful. You see, the danger is that they're so fast and athletic and strong, that if you're not super-quick, you know, then you're going to either miss, you're going to get bit, or something like that. So you just have to be really careful with how we do it. So we'll try and get him a little closer, so I can... JOHNNY SCREECHES THROUGHOUT Oh! BLEEP. Johnny's broken free. Someone could get seriously hurt. Get some... Get some fruit. And the team have to find a way to get him into the cage. They try to lure him with bananas. But Johnny can see what they're trying to do. He's afraid of the cage. Don't give him the whole thing. Don't give him the whole bag. Don't give him the whole bag. Open it and give him one. Next, a packet of sweets. And they prove more difficult to resist. Johnny. Keep going. It's just... Come on, you got to... Eddie, shut the door. Yeah, yeah. Right now, we've managed to get the chimp into the enclosure, but it was... It was lucky. He shouldn't have escaped, but he did. And this just reinforces further just how much more support these guys need. Some oranges? Some cabbage? Whoops. I'm going to go get him some other stuff. So, hopefully, over time, we'll build a relationship with him and it can happen pretty fast. Yeah, right, buddy? HE MAKES CHIMP CALLS No-one got hurt and he's safely inside the cage. So I think that's a good ending. HE CHUCKLES It's a near-disaster. CLAP OF THUNDER The rainy season is in full swing. Despite every effort to contain it, the cold has spread. And the baby group is under severe threat. Oh. That's a big 'un! Sorry, pal. I know. It's not nice. You can see everyone's got a cold, because we don't have a proper quarantine. Yeah, of course. Survivor had a cold when he came in. He shouldn't be with... Neither of these guys should be with everyone. You haven't got the facilities. We don't have the situation. The stress must be getting there that you want to move over sooner now. Yeah. Definitely. We need to get the hell out of Dodge, so to speak. You know what I mean? Like, we're kind of bursting at the seams in terms of chimps and how we can handle them with staff. And, like, I'd rather have everyone here have a cold and we're kind of a little stressed out than not take Survivor. That's what it comes down to. Of course. We have to remind ourselves... You always have to remind yourself - what's the alternative? Yeah. Sorry, pal. I know, it's not fun. They're just like kids. It's a worrying situation. Colds can develop quickly into lethal chest infections in chimps. The stronger that they are, just like humans, the better they can fight it off. But, to me, that's probably the most dangerous thing for them - is getting that chest infection, because... It's rapid, it spreads quickly. Yeah, especially if they've just come in and they don't have the strength. It's so much more dangerous. Like a human baby. You don't want to catch bronchitis or pneumonia if you're a baby. That's a huge fear. So I'm pretty paranoid about... Yeah, of course. ..it happening. Goo-goo-goo-goo. Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga. Rah! And most in danger from the cold is baby Gaia. She's under strict quarantine in the house, with Annie. Well, she's OK. Can you see? OK. Ah, Gaia! She's laughing. See her laughing? Ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga. We're also taking precautions to ensure the cold doesn't reach the big enclosure and infect the older chimps. Here, there's been a breakthrough. Mira's life on a chain is becoming a distant memory. She's now fully integrated and has found her place in the family. Mira is... Well, Mira is a miracle. So Mira is a miracle. I mean, I... She's just... It's like a weight has been removed from her body. I mean, she's just swinging. She's smiling. She's laughing. I mean, this morning I looked down and saw her in her enclosures. There was no-one around except for her, and she was hanging upside down, smiling. Just smiling by herself and giggling. You know, she's just experiencing joy - just pure joy. It's been a week since the two confiscated chimps - Star and Johnny - arrived. And I'm keen to see how they're getting on. Star is pretty mellow. She's like quite quiet. But, like, in the morning, she wakes up and she's so excited. So she starts rolling around in the bed. She's psyched. You can tell. She's like, "Oh, my God, I can't believe this is my..." Here I am. "This is my new life. This is amazing." You know? Hey, buddy. Jimmy and Jenny have been working hard to build a bond with Johnny. How's he doing, do you think? He's doing tons better. Yeah? I mean, his behaviour is so much different. You know, the first day - you saw how scared he was. Getting this close, even for me, now, he's nowhere near as scared or... You know, he was making that fear face. Yeah. Because he was freaked out. I mean, he didn't know what we were going to do him. No. He was leaving the place he'd lived with for so long. Obviously, he's realising that this is, you know, a safe place for him, which is great. You see, he's grooming now. A sign of trust, as well, isn't it? Yeah, of course. You know, when you're actually doing it with a... HE LAUGHS It's really relaxing, I have to say. Johnny's behaviour is a positive sign. Chimps use grooming as a way of forming close personal bonds with each other. Is it good to laugh? When was the last time you laughed, buddy? When was the last time you laughed? After ten years of being mistreated, Johnny's future is bright. I'm going to take good care of you. You got everything you need. But until they can move to their new home in the forest, Johnny will have to spend most of his time in this cage. We care for you. Relocating the chimps to the new sanctuary has moved another step closer. The Desmonds now have an architect on the project. And they've come to the capital, Monrovia, to sign off on the drawings. You found everything good, did you? Yeah, we're psyched. Very good. We can't wait to see the plans. You want to see the plans? OK. Yes. Have a seat, please. OK. You see where the building is? Architect Shalfiq is giving his services for free to help the chimps. I prefer that. That's way better. There it is. You can see it. I've never designed a chimpanzee sanctuary before. I've never had a chimpanzee client before. So I'm treating this as if chimpanzees are my clients. We'll have to know how they live every day. What are the activities they do? How do they use the buildings we're building for them? This is big. Yeah, it's a big area. It's a big area. This is like nine metres by 9.8 metres. But it's not going to be... Closed in. It's not going to be enclosed? No, no. Not even like fenced? They can...if they want to run out. There was a net before... The first phase of the build will include quarters for the older chimps and a new nursery for the babies. You know, make it functional as much as possible. Perfect. Priority has also been given to quarantine. This is for special cases, you know, cases that... Yeah, like if somebody needs to sleep - like Gaia. We have little baby Gaia, who you met, the little baby. She could stay in there. How is she? She's good. She's doing good? You'll be shocked, man. Let me show you a picture. She's good? Yeah. She's doing great. Oh, my God. Look at all her teeth. She's amazing. I know! The next step is to obtain the quotes and raise the finances to start building. Things are finally looking up. The cold outbreak seems to have gone away and the chimps are recovering. Life is getting back to normal. Oh, boy! I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you! You crazy boy! You crazy boy! You crazy boy! Whoa! Oh! JENNY LAUGHS Good jump, Boo-boo! Little Gaia can come outside and hang out with the other orphans. LAUGHTER CHIMP MAKES BABY-LIKE GURGLES There's still so much for the babies to learn before they head to their new forest home. Hey, guys. Hi. It's time for their second lesson in using tools. Prince, Princess, you're in my way. Good girl! For this class, we need to build something to help them practise. What do you think, Pick-pick? It's very exciting? Good girl. You're being very helpful. LAUGHTER Bui, you and a shovel is not a good combination! You're really doing it. Bui, Bui! Our replica termite mound will be perfect for teaching the orphans how to supplement their diet. In the wild, chimps use sticks or grass to dip into the holes of termite mounds. The insects climb on board... ..providing a vital source of protein. I want to see if the little chimps here are able to replicate this and to learn how to termite fish for themselves. What do you think, Picky P? Hm? Hi, little girl. Yeah, you good girl. You coming? OK. This isn't easy. In today's lesson, we've got the babies - Max, Bui and Picky... ..and the new arrival, Survivor - looking much happier, having got over his cold. To replace the insects, we're using the baby's favourite treat - honey. No, no, no. Come on, guys. Who'd have thought chimps would really like honey? If we teach them to start with... Is that in there, do you know? It's working, yeah. Ready? Like the last lesson, I'll demonstrate first and see if they can work it out for themselves. It's that association, isn't it? They've got to learn to associate if they put that straight in their mouth... Ah, there you go. Go on, Bui, put it in your mouth. That's it. Oh, oh! Put it in your mouth, Bui, in your mouth! Ugh. I don't think you've got the idea of this yet, have you? Come on, Picky. It takes wild chimps years to master. Look, look. Survivor's trying. And it turns out that Survivor is something of an expert. Oh, Survivor, what have you got? He's doing it already. That's straight across his mouth. Survivor, good boy! That's it. Ah, he's put it back. Oh, go on, go on, Survivor! Yes! You're a good boy. And we don't know much about his history, so... So if he came from the wild, at this age... He'll learn. ..he would have done this? Yeah. I mean, he's clearly done it before. And he's really excited about it. Look at him, he's like... He's got a big smile on his face. Proper chimp behaviour, heh, mate? Look at his face! LAUGHTER You're going to town on that! Now that Survivor has the skill... ..the others will be able to learn from him. Picky's watching. Watch. Yeah. Picky's really watching. He's straight on that. You want to try? Come here, little girl. Picky's really intent on trying to do this today. I know. Do you want to do it, Pickers? Picky's going... Come on, Pickers, are you going to try? Come on, Pickers. Jimmy, this is exactly what they should be doing in the wild. It's so good to see! Look at Bui! Oh, he just reached inside. LAUGHTER Like, "Why would I go through all the trouble?" "I can just reach in." Now, who's the clever chimp? Oh, jeez. Is that really necessary? Over the last couple of weeks, the Desmonds have taken in four more chimps, bringing the total to 34. The problems of overcrowding are even more acute. In the wild, adolescents reduce conflicts by hanging out in small groups. Without the extra space, tempers are fraying. It's almost on a weekly basis - new chimps are coming in. They've got more chimps now than they ever had before, and the ones they have got are getting bigger. They just can't fit them all into this facility here. The pressure's increasing. They really need to move to this forested area now. They can't stay here much longer. The forest sanctuary project has hit a major setback. The construction quotes have come in and they are three times greater than the Desmonds had expected. They now need to raise $1.5 million. Ah-ah, come here. We're going in. So the worst case scenario, if we can't get the money, I guess, is that we stay here longer, which I'm really... I don't want to think about it, to be honest. The whole thing's scary. What they're trying to do is huge, so there's lots of opportunities for this not to work right now. This time really seems like they've got it stacked against them. The problems with the sanctuary are mounting. And now, back at the house, another cold virus has struck the orphans. John-John. Johnny, the adult chimp, has fallen ill. I am worried about him. How long has he not been well? What is it, a chest infection? Yeah. I mean, the truth is, I don't have the diagnostics to really know, but he definitely has like some sort of chest infection and I'm treating it with some antibiotics and I'm probably going to have to add additional antibiotics. He's been sick for a few days. I mean, I've listened to his chest and it's rattling. And not to put too fine a point on it, that is your biggest worry, isn't it, with any chimp - having a chest infection? It's one of these things that can not only spread quickly, but it can escalate really quickly, as well. You know the worry's here. But this could be very serious for him, couldn't it? Yeah, I hope not, but, yeah. JOHNNY COUGHS Oh, Johnny. John-John. I'm sorry, buddy. But the cold had already reached the large enclosure... ..with disastrous consequences. Mira, who was rescued from her life on a chain... ..has died from a sudden onset of pneumonia. JENNY SOBS So losing Mira was really just awful. Um, I just... You know, we feel really like we rescued her from a horrible situation and we brought her here and we were supposed to give her a long, good, happy life. And she never got to the forest again. You know, we thought we were going to be able to provide her a nice, long life and, um... ..we just feel like we kind of... I feel, as the vet, that I kind of failed her. It's pretty devastating. But the more you know them, it's...it's heartbreaking. It's like losing a friend. It's like losing...losing a member of the family. Next time... What the hell is that noise? ..a fire threatens to burn down the sanctuary. SIREN BLARES It's OK, it's OK, buddy. It's OK. It's dry season and that fire's huge. It's going to spread. Lessons continue with the orphans learning how to make sleeping nests. Jojo's trying now. Oh, we're ready. Oh, I think you're ready for the forest, aren't you? And the chimps have a taste of life in the wild. It's been a really nice day seeing the kids out here in the place they should be. LAUGHTER Look at Picky's face! Look at Picky's smile! Are you laughing? Lessons are starting at a home for rescued baby chimpanzees in Liberia, West Africa. Maxi, what do you think, pal? LAUGHTER It's run by Jimmy and Jenny Desmond, and their team of carers. They've now got 36 chimps. All rescued from the illegal pet trade. But they're running out of space. HORN TOOTS They're pulling your skirt down. LAUGHTER Stop. Get it. Get it. Get it. The Desmonds want to build a new sanctuary in the forest, where the chimps can lead more natural lives. I'm Professor Ben Garett, a chimpanzee specialist. Oh, go on. Go on, Survivor. And I'm helping prepare the orphans for the move by teaching them how to live in the forest. Put it in your mouth... In your mouth. So far, they've been learning how to forage for food... CHIMPS SCREAM ..and what dangers to avoid. Max is playing with a deadly snake. So he would be dead. Yes. And that's as scary as it is. But plans to move have stalled. There isn't enough money. With new chimps being rescued all the time... There you go. ..it's getting dangerously overcrowded. CHIMPS SCREAM I'm worried about them. And a sudden death among the chimps has pushed everyone to breaking point. SHE CRIES Hey, how are you? Yeah. It's nice to see Ben, huh? Oh, Picky, I've got to respond... A little bit. A little bit nice. And then it's also nice to bite Ben. Yeah. I'm back in Liberia with my old friends, the Desmonds, to carry on our lessons with the rescued chimps. IMITATES CHIMP GRUNTS I know, man. It's exciting. You big girl. Since I was last here a few months ago, another four new babies have been brought in. Let me guess, is that Max? This is Catherine. Catherine's really shy. And this is Nnamdi. He's a tough little guy. He's doing really well. Shall we stop? Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. They laugh like we do and have complex personalities. That's Champ. Crazy, but very sweet and actually pretty scared of certain things. And then we've got little Ace. He's super sweet and cuddly, but he's shy. Be nice. Ah-ah. Like all the chimps here, their parents were killed for meat and they were sold as pets. Come on, you crazies. So when they come in like this, it's nice that they have each other. So this little group, they'll be together for... Well, they'll be together forever. I love how you put a positive spin on everything, you guys. It couldn't be more dire right now and more stressful, yet... The silver lining. I think you guys survive on silver linings. I have to or I would go crazy. It's been a difficult six months for the Desmonds. Their move to the new sanctuary has been put on hold due to spiralling costs. Max, leave it. And caring for the chimps in such limited space is getting very difficult. CHIMPS SCREAM I'm worried about the Desmonds, I really am. They seem to be in the middle of this...this perfect storm. When I first came out here, there were 21, and now, just over a year later, there's nearly 40. With more chimps comes more money, more stress, more time, more energy. I just don't see an end in sight for these guys. But, yeah, they're in a pressure cooker. I am worried. Today is an important day. We're moving three of the chimps. Survivor... ..Bui... ..and Jo-Jo, out of the house where the babies are kept to live with the older chimps in a large enclosure down the road. Jo Jo. Of all the chimp characters, Jo Jo is definitely one of my favourites. He's such a beautiful boy. He's very relaxed. He's got this long face. I like Jo Jo. I think you'll be happy with your new family. Jo Jo belonged to a market trader. When he kept eating her produce, she gave him to Jimmy and Jenny. Jo Jo's doing great. He's a real clown. LAUGHTER Physically, he has a little bit of stunted growth, so he wasn't getting the right nutrition because his head is sort of, like, bigger than the rest of his body, so he's h a little comical looking, like a little bit of a caricature. Jo Jo! Jo Jo, the football player. He can jump. That's why I call him the football player. He jump, jump, jump. Did you steal my hat? He's so funny. He's got a great personality, a really happy guy. LAUGHTER So it'll be really interesting to see how he does when he moves to the big group. Look at Jo Jo. He's all excited. Yeah, pal. This is exciting. It's important the move goes well. The house is now full and moving Jo Jo and the others to the large enclosure will make space for new arrivals. But it won't be easy. Moving the three babies in with the older chimps will be a delicate operation. First, we've got to get them there. Is someone on the roof? OK, guys, have a good day. You, too. Bye, everybody. See you. # You are doing something new in your life today # He's doing it... # To help settle them in, Annie and Jenna have come up with a special song. # He's doing it, he's doing it # He's doing it, he's doing it, he's doing it # You are doing something new in your life today... # Moving baby chimps into the big enclosure can be risky. Chimps live in strict hierarchical societies and it's impossible to predict how the older chimps will react to the little newcomers. We're going to have to introduce them very slowly. We'll bring them to the outside of the enclosure every day until we feel the older chimps have got used to them. Where are we going? CHIMP SQUEAKS It's OK. Until then, Jo Jo and his mates will have to watch their step. CHIMPS SCREAM This is Jo Jo's first day with the bigger kids and he's been so adventurous and so excited and in the bus he was all puffed up and he got here and he was all puffed up and now he's seeing the bigger kids and they're quite scary for Jo Jo, I think, and he's starting to realise that he's not quite as big as he thinks he is, maybe. And it's like any school, you move up a class and there are bigger kids there. In the wild, at the age of three, chimps start to venture more than a few metres from their mothers. Jo Jo is on a mission to explore. They're meeting the big kids but they're not staying with them. They're learning new skills, they're in a new environment. This is really important. It's probably quite scary, a bit intimidating and a bit of a rush, but they seem to love it. You really do, don't you? And eventually they'll all be integrated with their bigger mates. Ready for big school? He'll do it when he's ready, but it's only his first day. It's a big step. Big step, isn't it, mate? Yeah? So far, so good. The integration process has started well with no major incidents. Did you have a good day? But it's only the first step. Jo Jo, Survivor and Bui will sleep back at the house for a while before they're ready for their first night away from home. Good boy. Can you remember? In the garden... Good girl, Ellie belly. Well done. ..we continuing our lessons in termite fishing to get the new arrivals up to speed... ..when we hear a strange sound coming from outside the compound. CRACKLING You can still hear it crackling. Yeah. We don't have power now. Oh, really? Well, the light's off. Did we lose power? The electrics have gone and the chimps seem to know something's going on. Yeah, they're nervous. They're scared. Come here. LOUD CRACK What the hell was that noise? Come here, Ellie belly. Come here. It's OK, buddy. It's a fire. It's a huge bushfire that was lit deliberately to clear land, but it's gone out of control and spread over 5km. Project manager Simeon is worried it's become too big to contain. Uh-oh. I'm not sure what we can do. Simeon called the Fire Department, so... ..they're coming. OK, let's go back to the yard. Come on, Maxi. With over 20 older chimps and their carers penned inside the large enclosure, it's difficult to evacuate them all quickly. And Jimmy is worried about their safety. Andy, do you know if... Did you talk to them at the pavilion? Can they hear it? Do they know there's a fire? Are they going to be able to put it out? It is dry season and that fire's huge. It's going to spread. SIREN It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, buddy. It's OK. Oh, there it goes. THEY SHOUT INSTRUCTIONS So it didn't go to the pavilion side? OK. Thank you, Simeon. OK, OK. OK. SIREN So it sounds like it's not over the pavilion, which is good. Thankfully, the fire hasn't made it to the large enclosure. It's not? No. And they turned off the power, so that's good. So hopefully they'll put it out. Do you have a day when you don't have a disaster? There's always some surprising event that happens, you know. You've just got to be prepared. A new chimp or somebody's sick or a fire. You've had all this week. Car break down. Yes. All of those this week, and it's only Wednesday. True. The Fire Department managed to contain the blaze and we're redoubling our efforts to get out of here. Jenny is pushing on with fundraising while Jimmy and I continue with the chimp lessons. Hey, Picks, look at all this. Today's class is about building nests... A couple of piles. ..which will help the chimps sleep safe from predators up in the trees. Chimpanzee nests are skilfully constructed with a frame supporting a mattress of leaves for comfort. What they'll do, they'll grab branches from a surrounding tree, high up usually, and pull them together, they'll interweave them, all the leaves the middle, and sleep inside them. They do this twice a day during the day for a day nest and also overnight as well. We're going to go make nests, huh? I reckon most of these kids today will be awesome at nest building. It's something that you learn really quickly, from day one, mum is building a nest, so it's there, hopefully. We'll see. We'll see. Maxi, come here, big man. We're starting with the baby group, keeping it simple with a few small branches. Come on, Chance. You going to play in the leaves? I'm going to demonstrate by making my own nest... Are you watching? ..and hope they learn by copying me. You're not, are you? You're not watching. I can tell. Trying to teach baby chimps is not easy. If you don't get their full attention, it's simply impossible to keep them under control. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me guess... Don't kiss me after trashing me. Maxi, you want to make a nest? The naughtiest of all is two-year-old Max. Maxi! What's in there? Oh...! Max. You crazy boy. Did you get that? Oh, you. Oh, I don't want him in the nest. I don't want him in the nest. Oh, you crazy boy. Come on. The only baby who shows an inkling in nest building is Picky P, who has found her own supply of materials. Oh, see, Picky's starting to make a nest with the blankets. Maybe she thinks the blankets are a little more comfortable than the leaves. She's not wrong. LAUGHTER You crazy beast. LAUGHTER Clearly, the baby group still has a long way to go before they can build their own nests. Max, come here. I just built a whole nest and you're sitting in it. It doesn't count. It does not count. We decide to go into the bigger enclosure to see if the older chimps can do any better. So who have we got, Jimmy? This is Bu Bu - Bui. Hey, Bu. And I've got Jo Jo on my back. I can see Jo Jo. Jo Jo. We're starting with the chimps who recently came from the baby house. Jo Jo, Survivor and Bui. You going to eat it? You silly man. They seem about as interested in nest building as the babies did. You going to make a nest? Jo Jo would rather play his favourite game. Did Jo Jo just take my hat? Was that Jo? Yes. I swear to God, these people. Oh, that's old Jo. Hat on his head. Nest building is not going amazingly. It's much more fun to fight and play. What's happened is, I've built a nest, you've built a nest, and we're sitting in our own respective nests. Class dismissed. There are a lot of zeros. Yeah. But it turns out that someone was paying attention after all. Just as we're finishing, Jimmy, Jo Jo's trying now. He's starting to go for it? Yeah, he's starting to do it. He's doing the right thing, he's going round and round to make this perfectly even nest all around the edges. He's breaking the branches and he's tamping it down, making it look nice. It kind of reminds me a little bit of when dogs, you know, they want to curl up, they're getting ready to sleep and they've got to do it a few times to get just the right position. It's a little bit the same thing. You know, I'm going to turn around and say that was job well done. The boys did good. It was looking pretty bleak there for a while. I never thought I'd say Jo Jo, you're my star pupil today now. Hopefully the others should now copy Jo Jo and start making their own nests. There's a bit of good news about the new sanctuary the Desmonds are hoping to build. Totally. It's going to be amazing. Except for the part of raising the money to build it. The architect has finished the drawings and the Desmonds have a plan for the first phase of the build. Yeah, we've got a nice veterinary centre, nursery, food prep, so everything's really accessible and easy to get to. This is exciting. I know. To see... They're rectangles and squares on a map, but that means, this is it, this is progress, isn't it? This is it. So in a few months' time! We have a lot to do ahead of us. There's a lot to do. It makes it real. Yeah. Real in...on a lot of different levels. And construction projects always go according to plan. Of course. You know, so I'm looking forward to that part of it. One of the babies is particularly interested in the plan. Exactly. Hello. Look at you. Hello. You want to see, buddy? This is where you going to be. So you can see the... He likes the forest already. And then... What do you think, pal? Oh, boy. Here we go. Ace doesn't seem very impressed. Do you see that? What do you think? Oh, wow. What do you think? That's what... That's what Ace thinks. That's what Ace thinks of this. Thanks, buddy. Why didn't you already build it, he's saying. Good boy. Good boy. That's really... ..pleasant. Oh, my God. All right, pal. Hopefully, you know, we get the cash and then we can do it. Ace seems to have other ideas for the plans. He's literally making a nest out of his new home. Are you making a nest out of your new home already? At least the nest building classes appear to be working. I think we're being told to wait. We're not? Oh. Hello. Oh, careful. Let me give you... Ready? Jimmy and Jenny never expected to be living in Liberia with a family of orphaned chimps. Did you see that little manoeuvre? Thank you. Thanks. Today, they're taking me on a trip to show me why they first came here. They arrived three years ago to look after a completely different group of chimpanzees that had been experimented on by an American research organisation. Back in the 1970s, a group came here and started a research project using chimpanzees. So biomedical research to develop hepatitis vaccines. And they did research on the chimps for like 30 years and then eventually retired them to these islands within this habitat, and so that's who we're going to go see now. The chimps that were used in the research. Hello, baby. Hello, sweetheart. Hello. Here they all come. Hi, sweetheart. That's my girl. I see you. IMITATES CHIMP GRUNTS The white patch, that's Samantha. She's the boss lady. Oh, really. And that's Lo Lo. He's the big alpha male. These chimps were taken from the wild and infected with hepatitis and other diseases over many years. That's Bullet. That's Bullet. He's the poster boy for what happened to these guys. Yeah. You know, mum killed, he was shot, his arm had to be amputated because it was so infected, and then he survived all those years of research, and yet... Look at him. ..here he is, you know, still going strong, Missing all his teeth now, but he's... A big boy. Hello, big boy. So he's a cool guy, you know, and he's stuff so, yeah, he's pretty awesome. Jimmy and Jenny no longer look after the research chimps but the laboratory where the testing took place is on the same site where they now keep the older rescued orphans. CHIMPS SQUEAL For 30 years, the lab chimps were held in conditions like this and subjected to invasive medical experiments. Over 400 chimpanzees died here. Some of the carers, like Annie, who now works with Jimmy and Jenny, used to be employed at the lab looking after the baby chimps. Jenna also worked at the lab. She has a photograph from when she was younger, carrying baby chimps to have their blood taken. After the testing finally stopped, the surviving chimps were abandoned on the islands. They were left starving, until a charity stepped in to help and hired Jimmy and Jenny to look after them. When they arrived in Liberia, they came across an even bigger problem, threatening the very survival of the species here. Liberia's wild chimpanzees are rapidly going extinct. Their forest is being cleared for industries like palm oil. They're being hunted for their meat. And their babies are trafficked as pets. We rescued two orphaned chimps in that first couple of weeks we were here, and so we really thought someone needed to address that problem. And here we are, you know, three years later, after thinking we'd only be here for a month. We have an opportunity to do something really great. And as Liberia rebuilds, we can build this sanctuary. And then the care-givers themselves, the people who used to work with the chimps during the research years and saw them go through this horrible traumatic time, get this, you know, this chance of sort of redemption, that they can help these other chimps that are really in need and help them get to a better place. So it feels like we're part of something, I guess, bigger than just, you know, just building a sanctuary. Are you happy now? I think that's the legacy here. We've turned something around from being horrific into something that's inspiring, that gives us a reason for hope. Jo Jo. OK, guys, want to go? Come on. We're going. Our plans to free up space by moving three of the babies to live at the big enclosure have reached the final stage. After several weeks of gentle acclimatisation, Jo Jo, Bui and Survivor are about to move in permanently. Come on. We're going. It's big sleepover night. This move will also mark a big change in how they are cared for. Bedtime. Bedtime. Bedtime. Up till now, they've slept with their carers and the Desmonds, as they would with their own mothers in the wild. Now they'll be sleeping alone. But to soften the transition, Annie will stay with them for the first few nights. You crazy people. You silly boy Oh, you. Did you do that? They're safe. They're with their main mum, Annie, through the night, so they'll feel very safe and that's important. Jo Jo. You'll be fine. Big boy. OK, Joey. OK, big man. You have a good first night. Night, Survi. You silly face. I'll see you in the morning. OK, night, guys. Thanks, Annie. Thanks, Daniel. Night, boys. In a couple of nights, the boys will be sleeping with the bigger chimps. We'll be keeping a close eye on them to see how they're getting on. Jenny's fundraising drive to raise cash for the new sanctuary is finally starting to bear fruit. We've gotten some really very, very generous donations in the last couple months between family and friends and we've also gotten some funding from the EU, which is fantastic, and so we're basically in a position to start getting some of the foundations laid on our new land. You guys aren't making this easy. We're really only halfway there. We're going to need the rest of the funding. So that's what I'm working on pretty much every day, besides tickling. So far, they've raised over £300,000 and hopes are high that they'll find the rest. I think he can raise all the rest. I think he just pressed donate. Did you just donate 300,000? Done. And there's more good news in the form of an unexpected donation. After two decades of civil war and an Ebola outbreak, Liberia is on the mend and the UN is leaving town. As a parting gift, they've donated four shipping containers for the new sanctuary. That's what I needed to hear. I'll pay you tomorrow morning. No problem. OK. Thanks, man. The containers will save the project thousands of pounds and will be put to good use - for accommodation, workshops and storage. It's exciting, huh? What do you think, man? Pretty cool, huh? Yeah. We're going to make them into something good. Even you can live in... No, big house. Yes. It's a big house, John. LAUGHTER With the move to the new sanctuary looking increasingly positive, I want to recap on the lessons we've had so far. First, I want to see what the babies have learned about dealing with snakes. When we first started, they had no idea what a snake was. Right now, that is perfect. Max is playing with a deadly snake. So he would be dead. Yeah. And that's as scary as it is. Yeah. We've been teaching the chimps to stay away and raise the alarm. I wonder if they've remembered the lesson. CHIMPS CALL Oh, already. THEY ALL SCREAM/HOWL Of all these skills, this is the life or death, and we're moving to a forest where there are snakes and they need to have this fear. Where's Max, out of interest? Right here. of course he is. Oh. I told you. Remember last time? Remember, last time he was rubbing at this. THEY SCREAM/HOWL Max is really impressing me. His hair is up, he's bluffing around, he's doing the fear grin. He's really learned his lesson. Oh, what is it? I know. I know. Good boy, Max. You good, smart boy. I feel very encouraged. Flying colours. Well done. Good job, Ellie. Well done, guys. No more of those horrible snakes. Yeah. We'll get those snakes, we'll get those snakes. Next, I want to see how they're getting on with nut cracking. You going to crack open some nuts? Huh? Of all the skills, this is the hardest and most complicated to grasp. OK! The newest arrivals have now started to learn. He does it perfect. Hey, Simy. And one of them, called Simeon, is already a pro. Good boy. He's so good. He's got a special rock? He has a special rock... That's really interesting because they have special rocks in the wild. ..that he likes here. And he's good at cracking with it. Wow. Good one, Sim. The nice thing is now that he'll be able to pass on that skill to his new family here and in the forest as well. The kids have all really well so far in nearly all the lessons. But, as you'd expect, some are much better than others at different tasks, and that's fine because that reflects exactly what you'd see in the wild. And they've started this really long process of learning. I didn't expect them to be perfect in any of these things, but the fact they're able to do some of these things is really positive. Well done, guys. I think you're ready for the forest, aren't you? It's been a few weeks since Jo Jo, Bui and Survivor were moved from the house to live with the older chimps in the large enclosure. I've come to see how they're getting on. So Jo's down there and he's being... Being Jo. Yeah. He's still a total goofball He's doing well. They're all mixing in well with a group. Jo Jo! Some of the older chimps have become very maternal towards Jo Jo, Survivor and Bui, which is exactly as it should be in the wild. Even though they're all orphans, the chimps have built their own cohesive family group. Hey, Jo Jo. Jo Jo. There we go. You silly boy. He still does those funny spinning moves and stuff like that. Here he comes. It's weird seeing them in here because they were the big boys. Yeah, they were the big guys at the house. They're tiny. They're so much smaller. They're so, so small in here. Hey, Jo Jo. Hey, you silly man. Jo Jo and his friends have successfully made the move from the house and have freed up space. But new chimps keep arriving. They've had a call from the Forestry Authority. They're bringing in another baby chimp they've just rescued. Hi, Steve. How you doing? He's a male, around two years old, and emaciated, rescued by Officer Jimmy Parker. Come on. Come on. Hello. Let's see. Here. Or it's just broken by itself. Oh, it's a broken bone. It's swollen. Really swollen, isn't it? Yeah, it looks swollen. Let me see. Does it hurt you, buddy? Yeah, it's bothering him a little bit. This case is special. The woman selling the chimp was arrested and is now going to be prosecuted. It will be the first case of its kind in Liberia. This is serious stuff. This is really big, right? Actually, it's good, but it's just that we are not very strong yet in the prosecution. I know. I know, but we will push, right. We'll push. We're getting our first prosecution all the way through for a chimp, OK. So it's this guy. The prosecution would be a major part of the awareness. Huge. Talking, talking is good, but when you take action, people will see and then they will carry the message around. It's going to be very important and then the people will be scared. They'll say, "Wait a minute. Wait, you go to jail for this? "OK, maybe I don't want to do it." You guys. Yeah. Hey... It's amazing. I'm very, very happy. I'm not happy to have another chimp... How you doing? You can't come in here. You can't come in here. Who is that? This is a crazy place, huh? There's a lot of chimps A lot of chimps. When Jimmy arrives home, he examines the new chimp's broken arm. It looks like it's a break that's healing but it's probably a... I don't know how bad the fracture is. You know, they're pretty tough little guys so you might have a little misshapen arm, but it probably won't impact his ability to climb and do whatever he needs to do, is my guess. There's another baby in there. You see? That's going to be your friend. See you later. See you later. With the first prosecution for chimp trafficking potentially under way, it feels like attitudes are starting to change. We're also kicking off an education programme at our local primary school. Ultimately, the goal is that we don't get any more chimps and we can never make that happen without truly enforcing the law and changing the mind-sets and working with people here to understand the importance of protecting chimps and keeping them in the wild. That's our... That's our ultimate goal and that's our ultimate mission. We've joined forces with a local theatre group who want to help the chimps by showing the kids it's against the law to hunt them or keep them as pets. HE SCREAMS AND SHOUTS APPLAUSE We're also leaving a permanent reminder of the day. A local artist, Godwin Yoryor, has designed a mural to add some colour to the campaign. DRUMMING Liberia is breeding up a new generation. Here they are. The kids. If these kids are educated that wildlife is important to our country, when they grow up with that notion, their generation will cease to hunt wildlife. So it's really important to engage the kids. Kids are the future and the kids are the only chance we have of protecting and saving Liberia's wildlife. And if we don't really reach the kids, then all the other work we're doing is pointless. Today has been really fun. It's manic, it's crazy. But the kids are enjoying themselves. That's the most important thing. And they've pained a really nice mural with chimps and other animals they find in the forest. So hornbills, hippos, pangolins, duikers, and hopefully this will help get the message across. Just what's on their doorstep and how important it is to try and save these species. DRUMMING APPLAUSE Today is just the beginning. We're planning to roll out these events across the whole country. The Desmonds are part of a wider alliance trying to save Liberia's chimps. The government has started to crack down on illegal hunting and Jimmy and I have been invited to one of their first big media events. The commercial bushmeat trade is a massive problem. This is when people come into a forest like this and just hunt out the animals. That meat, chimpanzees included, goes to the big cities, it goes to Monrovia, and actually, very often, it's worth more than beef. So it's not for poor people. It's a luxury item. It then very often goes international and that luxury food item is needlessly driving the extinction of chimpanzees. The Forestry Development Authority has seized illegal bushmeat at roadside checkpoints and today they're planning to destroy it. The press have been invited to watch. What surprised me, like, really surprised me, is there's so much primate, there's so much monkey here. You can see they're just everywhere. I know. It's great. This is great. Thank you. APPLAUSE This is good news. I agree, man. Liberia's getting serious, eh. This could mark a turning point in the fight to save wild chimpanzees. In West Africa, the numbers have collapsed by 80% in the last 25 years. At this rate, they'll soon be extinct. Liberia is so important of a country for conservation. Yeah. You know, it's the only country in West Africa that still has a lot of forests left, still has a lot of wildlife left, still has a lot of biodiversity. And, you know, with the government taking these kinds of actions, it gives hope that those forests and those animals can be protected and saved, so we're slowly moving forward and making change and we'll just keep going, you know. With some of the funds now raised for the new sanctuary, it feels like the goal is in sight. Ellie belly... Where's Ellie? So we're taking five of the younger chimps to see their future home... HORN TOOTS ..and give them a taste of life in the forest. Yeah, we're going. Let's go. The last time these babies were in a forest, their families were killed and they were taken to be sold as pets. Come on, Ellie belly. SHE CHANTS: Forest, forest, we're going to the forest. Forest, forest, going to the forest. Where are you off to, Max? Where are you off to? Your new... Your new forest. You crazy girls. Since they left the forest, this is going to be the first time they're going back to, like, a real forest, you know? And the first time they're going to be seeing what will be their new home, like, their home for a long time, you know. So it's pretty exciting for them and for us. Here we go, into the forest. We're going in, we're going in. Already you can feel it's cooler. Oh, gosh, it feels so much better. Yay! Yay! We're in the forest, big man. Yay, yay. We're in the forest. What do you think, big girl? We're in a forest. We're in a forest. LAUGHTER Look at Picky's face. Look at Picky's smile. And she's laughing. Is this fun? Is this fun, my beautiful girl? Is this fun? What's up there? Look. What's that? What's that? Look. You've found some termites in there? Good job, guys. What's in there? What's in there? Look at them, they're getting termites and ants out of the log. This totally normal stuff. We don't have to make this for them any more. They're just getting through and exploring and every single thing is a new climbing frame and a new... ..a new game. It's so cool. It's brilliant. Look how high up Picky is. This is just the first step. The Desmonds will need a huge amount of infrastructure to live here with the chimps. We've come a really, really, really long way from the day we set foot in Liberia. We still have a long way to go but this is a pretty hugely important first step, I think, to see these guys playing in the forest and see how happy they are. I know. It's really nice to see... Like, Chance was on this tree going crazy and seeing Picky P's face. You know, it's better, I think, than we had imagined, and now we just have to do a lot of work to get the rest of the guys out here. To be permanently here. You silly girl. It's been so nice today to see the chimps in the forest and to watch them playing up in the trees and crashing around and fighting and playing in the place they should be. Makes it all worthwhile. It's a lot of tough times. You see a lot of sadness. And these babies have gone through so much and so it makes it all worth it to see them like this, and happy and smiling. It makes it all worth it. I think, mostly, I'm... ..I'm grateful for... ..the fact that we, erm... ..have been able to rescue all these guys and get to do the work that we do. Erm... And, erm... ..I'm grateful for all the people that have... ..helped us get to where we are. I think for a lot of people, what you hope is that you find something that you can make a difference, you know. And we've found that. And that's... ..you know, that's really nice. I'm grateful for that, you know. So... ..I hope so. I hope we're making a difference. I mean, you know, I hope so. Slowly, slowly. As they say in Liberia, small, small. So we're getting there. Small, small. It's stimulation, it's enrichment... And so is the camera. THEY LAUGH Oh, my God. Uh-oh. Come on, buddy. Watch out.
