Subtitles by explosiveskull Nowhere to run. Mic was off. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's nice. Check one, two. This is my apartment. Spacious, friendly, clean. Hey buddy! You filming already? Yeah, might as well. Oh, shit. - Hey, hey. - Welcome, welcome. I brought some of the outlines and shot lists. - Cool. - And my iPad. Good. This is our home office during pre-production. We want to shoot, well, technically we want to leave on the 29th and start shooting on the 30th of April. Here is the script. I actually helped you revise this so maybe we could update the cover, and put something like "revisions ..." - We'll talk about it later. - Ok. When Sam and I both want to be in front of the camera at the same time... Tripod. Oh, look... Here's a little blood left over from one of our short films. - Hmm. - Creepy. There will be plenty of blood in the movie. So does this lens zoom? - No. - Ok. So if you want to zoom you have to move the tripod closer. Cool. "This is Louis Melbourne, this is my brother, Will Melbourne." "Say hi, Will." "The camera points to the person driving the truck, Will. Will gives the camera a slight smile." "Hello. Hi." "Will, where are we going?" - "Going to Mom's." - "Why?" "Because she died." I like that. I think that it sets the tone pretty quickly. Every movie has to have some storyboards and we've started storyboarding. We have Will, played by Sam, driving up with his brother, Louis, played by your's truly. They venture up into Frazier Park to their mom's cabin, where they end up being greeted by the groundskeeper, who isn't all that he seems to be. I'm not the greatest storyboarder, Sam's much better than me, But, you know, you get the idea. This is a guy unpacking. Here are the audition sides that we have for the groundskeeper. I imagine it will be a little something like this... "I'm the groundskeeper," "I saw a strange car outside and thought I would check in." I think you should play the groundskeeper and we'll get another guy to play Louis! - I love it. - Yeah! This scene here, I really think it needs to get pushed. - Mhm. - Maybe we can push... - Hold on, sorry. - It's all good. - Give me twenty minutes. - Ok. Hey. Hey! Hey. Hi Jen! Hi! I didn't mean to interrupt. I was hoping we could get some of this for the documentary. Is that cool? We're taping everything behind the scenes. Is that cool? - Yeah. - Sorry! What do you have to say about this movie? I think it's really great. I think you guys are really talented, and I love my boyfriend, and I support him. Aww. I think it's going to turn out really great. I'm excited for you guys. - Thank you. - Thank you! Ok, I'll leave you guys alone. - Bye, Jen! - Thanks for doing that. Hello? Hey Gene, this is Tyler calling about your Airbnb cabin. Oh, yeah. Hey Tyler. What's going on? I just had a couple of questions, wanted to run some stuff by you. Me and a friend are making a movie, and we were wondering if we could shoot at your place? It would be super small, just three people. Yeah, I guess so. There was actually a film shoot out here before. - Yeah go right ahead. - Oh, wow. I actually have a question about the location. This is Sam by the way, friend of Tyler's. How is the cabin? Are there a lot of other cabins, or is it pretty desolate? There's a little village about a half-mile away, but besides that it's just you guys out there. Ok, that's great. We were just curious if there were any neighbors, specifically for script purposes. We'll finish the booking and get this thing settled. No problem, have a great night. I appreciate it. Alright, you too. Take care. - We're making a movie! - Yeah! So this is my apartment. It's doubling as our casting and audition location. - We'll set up the tripod here. - Sure And then we'll use the white wall for the audition? Yeah. They can stand right here and this is their space to do whatever they want. This looks really good. - How's it going? - Hey, good. How are you? These actors that are coming in today are going to be judged on their acting abilities, as well as their willingness to go out into the middle of the woods with Tyler and I for a week. Hello, my name is JR Bourne. I'm Tom Morris. Bob. My name is David Krater and I'm auditioning for the part of the groundskeeper. Unique New York. Rubber baby buggy bumpers. "Hello, is Miss Melbourne home?" "Is Miss Melbourne home?" "Who are you?" "I'm the groundskeeper." "This is uncomfortable, but your mother actually owed me a couple weeks worth of payment." "Didn't you find the picture?" "It would have spelled it out for you perfectly." "I was in love with your mother." "I was in love with your mother!" "Ok?" "You killed our mom?" "That's right!" "And now it's time to get rid of the evidence." Todd Berger. I think Todd was just a little too... "character-y." What do you think about JR? I think that he delivered a really good performance, but my only fear is that he's too good-looking for this role. I liked Tom the best, I think he has the best look of all these guys. - It's him. - Tom. It's Tom. Hey Tom, it's Tyler Schnabel from "Frazier Park." Yeah. Congratulations, you are the groundskeeper! Oh, cool. I know this is a quick turnaround as far as production goes. If you have any questions at all about your character, the script, please don't hesitate to shoot Sam or I an email. I do have one question. Is this the whole cast? Is it just us, are there any other family members? No, it's just Groundskeeper, Will and Louis. Wow, ok. I don't know if you noticed, on my résumé, under skills, that I play guitar. So I'll probably bring that. You know, honestly, I don't think we need it. That's cool. You can leave that at home, we have a lot of equipment in the car. Thanks a lot, Tom, can't wait! - Alright, thanks Tyler. - Yeah, no problem. - Bye bye. - Bye. It would be cool to have something that looks really old and rustic. Can we take that blade off? I don't know, that would be tough. Dude, those are huge. That would be tough to rig. - What's that? - This thing? - You use it to cut roots. - Pruning saw. Wait, go back. Alright, I'm going to dutch-angle. Now just hold it up in the air. Yeah, now come at me. Oh, that's creepy. Ok, alright. - Do you have a bag? - Sure. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot, take care. - Oh, that's nice. Is it sharp? - Yeah, it's really sharp. Check this out. Can these unscrew? Yeah. Ok, so I think what we'll do is make a fake blade out of cardboard or something, and we fit that in for the dummy one. More of like a serial murderer. Nice. Hey what are we going to do for his shoes? - Thank's a lot. - Thank you. Is it hot? No, maybe a little small on me. I think Morris is a little bit shorter than I am. Oh, shit! - Where's the weapon? - It's pretty good? Yeah, grab that knife. Ok! Here are some of my clothes that I'm thinking about packing. Hard to do this myself here. Yeah, something like that. "Hello, my name is Louis." "Hello, my name's Louis." "I am Louis." "Hi, I'm Louis." Yeah. - Hey dude. - Hey. - Just working on my wardrobe. - Nice. - How's it look? - Looks like Louis. We're both doing two or three changes of wardrobe for our characters. Yeah. It's supposed to take place during the weekend. I'm going to bring, just to be safe, probably four or five options. That way we can choose on the day, "Oh, this actually looks better in this lighting." Alright, well, I gotta figure out mine too. I might have to go shopping. We got all our shit packed up. Or, sort of packed up. We got all our shit. How do you feel about tomorrow? I won't lie, I'm pretty nervous. This has been building up for a long time. My hope is that everything goes smoothly, and if not, we went out there and we did it. A lot of people have that initial idea of making a film, writing it down on paper, but to actually go out and execute it like we're trying to do, that doesn't normally happen. I'm just really trying to focus on my acting to be honest with you. I'm not an actor, so you're comparing yourself to me. While you guys will be the anchors of this whole thing, I'll just try my best. Man, this is some good-ass filmmaking. To tomorrow, us driving out to Frazier Park to shoot this thing. To a film that will make us famous! To a film that will make us infamous. Oh yeah! I want to be real for a minute. You are leaving soon. I just want to say, this past month has been one of the best months that I've ever spent in Los Angeles. Thank you for being a great friend, and an awesome person to work with, and I wish you all the best in your future travels with your new woman. - Thanks man. - Hope it works out. Because it's scary, you know? That means a lot, dude. You know it, dude. Hey, great acting! Just bring that to the film, and we've got something! Alright, cool, good, yeah, it's all bullshit. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Woo! Everything that doesn't fit in the cab has to go in this bed. Careful with those two bags. Look at all this shit. Did all the perishables fit in the cooler? Apples, bananas, ok good. So this is all the dry stuff, right? Let's take out these boxes and let's lay them down in the bed of your truck. You mind if I hang up my shirts next to yours? Yeah. Ok, so it says it's around here. Ok. No, this isn't the right street. No, it's... This isn't it? It's saying it's up here on the right. Ok. Ok. - Is that him? - I think that's him. - Why does he have his guitar? - Hey Tom! - What's up? - How's it going? Hey! Just put your stuff back there if you want. - He's bringing his guitar. - He's bringing his guitar! Sorry about that. Alright! You guys still shooting behind-the-scenes stuff? Yeah we'll be rolling the entire time. - That's cool right? - Yeah. Are you staying at a motel? Yeah, my place is getting fumigated for termites. - That sucks! - Yeah. I've actually had a bed bug problem before. - That wasn't very fun. - Yeah. Brought the guitar, huh? Yeah, if you want, I'd love to put some music in the movie. It's found footage so I don't think there's going to be any need for it. And the groundskeeper doesn't really play guitar, I don't think that's his character. But, we can figure something out. Hey, you can always play some nice background music while we're shooting. - Yeah. - Sounds good. Maybe we could start a fire or something and just... - Sing "Kumbaya?" - Yeah. Yeah, get to know each other a little bit. - Great. - Sounds good. Here she is, the Frazier Park cabin! The what? The Frazier Park cabin. Ok! Oh yeah, this is nice! - Nice man! Look at this! - Good call with this place. Look at this! Thirty-five eleven. - Got em'. - Fantastic. Alright, moment of truth. - Woo! - Oh, yeah! How is it? Is it everything you imagined it to be? We'll take a look around once we get everything. Ok, cool. There you go. - Got that? - Yeah. Careful with that. Lights. Bulbs. Good job. You want to give me the camera and you can get some stuff? - Careful now, careful. - I'm good, I'm good. - Pretty nice. - Yeah, this is good. How does that bed work out for you? - Gonna be fine. - Good. Spacious. Oh, cool. Look at that. Can't see anything because it's so over-exposed. Oh yeah! - Nice? - Yeah this is really good. Fish. Ooh! Super cozy! It feels really good too. I was expecting it to be kind of hot in here. Yeah, right. There's no AC but it feels really cool for the afternoon. It's that cool mountain air. How do you do this? - What are you trying to do? - Open it. There you go, nice. So this porch could work too for the final scene. There's been so much wildlife running around. I saw a rabbit and some chipmunks down there. It's isolated. Yeah, very much so. Help yourself to any food. I've got turkey and cheese if you want to make yourself a sandwich. - Oh, thanks. - No problem. Here it is, the special effects blood that you will be covered in. What is it? I think it's safe. You think it's safe? - It's not real blood. - It won't stain your skin. - Oh, that's good. - And there are no chemicals. It's all safe. Movie prop blood. Real blood will stain your skin for a few days. - Oh, does it? - Are you serious? Yeah if you ever cut your knee or whatever. It just dyes your skin. - Oh, wow. - Hmm. We were thinking the groundskeeper could be creepily stalking Will and Louis. I like this garden area. Horseshoes. - Oh, cool. - Do you play? Yeah, I've played a little bit, sure. Are you challenging me? - Yeah, later on, absolutely! - Ok. I suck so you'll probably beat me. Perfect. What is this? - A little bench, I think. - Huh. Oh, look he's actually practicing. Nice. - You see that? - You got one? - I got two! - Oh! Oh, my God. This backdrop is amazing! Come on down. Watch out, these are prickers. You're a pricker. You smell that? It's just so fresh. I love this. This is the tree right here. - This is the tree. - This is it. - So this rock is his gravesite? - Yes. Maybe we can... I don't want to etch anything, but yeah, this works. Down here is where we see the killer with the knife. No, stay there. He's back here. We're thinking back here for you. When you show up with the blade and you start chasing after us. Sam. Heads up! Thanks, Tom! Sorry. What was his name again, the homeowner? Gene. Gene told us to pour water in this thing because it humidifies the cabin. Oh. Apparently when you run the wood stove it can dry the place out. I never would have guessed that. Dry air will give you nosebleeds. Oh, yeah? Sure. Go in for more! - I'm going for the middle. - That's the good piece. Sam got us a nice pie. Already ate half of it. Thank you Sam. No problem. Oh, yeah! Alright! -Cheers, dude. - That's very pretty. - Thanks. Who's he talking to? Oh, his girlfriend. He's actually moving in with her in about a month. She's all the way in Indianapolis and he's in the middle of a big move. Hey. Hey, come on in here! - I'm talking to Jen. - I know you're talking to Jen. Give me five minutes. He's not listening to me. Oh, Jen! I hate to break you guys up but I've got to steal Sam right now. We're having a filmmaker, actor moment. - Classic, I get it. - You heard him. Alright, I'll just talk to you tomorrow then. - Alright. - Have a good night. - Have a good night. - Love you. - Love you too. Bye. - Bye. Kiss the iPad. Yes, yes, yes. What's going on in here? The gang's all here. Dude, we're just drinking some beers! - Tom's playing some music! - Sounds good! Here take this. Take it. Tom, put down the guitar. Grab your beer. There isn't anybody else I'd rather be with this week to make this movie "Frazier Park." We are some talented motherfuckers and we're going to make a great fucking movie. Thank you. - Cheers. - Amen. There you go. Cheers, cheers. Hey, I want to say something too. Yeah, go ahead. I just wanna tell you how happy I am to be on this project. It's a real pleasure, and a challenge. I think it's great to see you guys have passion You have a great rapport, it seems. That goes a long way to making things go easy. You know? During the whole project. Totally. I think if it stays like this, in the end it's going to be something beautiful. So, yeah. Cheers to that! Thanks, Tom. Cheers! Hey man, bring it in. - There we go! - Happy to have you here. Yes. - This is great. - Yeah. We need to go over a lot of those scenes... I think I'm going to call it a night. - Ok, yeah. - Absolutely. Let us know if you need anything. If not we'll see you tomorrow, man. Be camera-ready at 7:30, first shot's up at 8. - You got it. - Ok, awesome. - Night. - Goodnight! You and me. You and me, brother. No one else. Tom? Shit. - Sam. - Yeah? - Do you know where Tom is? - No. I can't find him anywhere. - Is he not in his room? - No. Tom! - I'll give him a call. - Yeah, ok. It is our first day of shooting and our lead actor, Tom, is missing. - He's not answering. - No? It's ringing but no one is picking up. Tom! Tom? Tom! Tom! Yeah, I'm pissed now. Yeah, I can tell. I'm pissed too but we can't let it get in the way of the project, you know? Yeah. We're going to have to shoot the beginning. We didn't plan on doing that until later but we've got to do it now. It's the only... You're right, you're right. - We can't... - Your'e right. That's fine. Ok. - Let's pick it up. - Let's do it. What jacket are you wearing today? - I'm wearing my jean jacket. - Ok. I'll wear my tan. - Tan jacket. - Cool. "Hi, I'm Louis." Testing, testing. Testing, testing. Check. One. Two. Check. Check. Check. - Cool. - Good. - Rolling sound. - "Frazier Park," scene one. Sweet! "Hello, my name is Louis Melbourne." "This is my brother, Will. Say hi, Will." "Hello. Hi." "Where are we going today?" - "We're going to Mom's." - "Why?" "Because she died." "Here we are, home, sweet home." "It's been a long time since we've been here, huh?" Action. What's my line? I say, "Mom, you home?" You go, "Wow that's fucked up." Ok, here we go. Action. "Hey Ma, you home?" "That's really fucked up, dude." "Wow, Mom really kept it the same in here." "Yeah." "She could have made this a guest room." "If she ever had any." Shit. - Hey, don't... - No, I can't. - Hey. - Hey. Where were you? - I went for a walk and... - Did you get my calls? No, I didn't. Did you call my phone? Yeah, I called you a dozen times. You're three hours late. - Production started at 7:30. - I know, you told me last night. - Here it is 10:30... - Ok, alright. I went for a walk and I got lost. Every day that we're in this cabin costs money. We just wasted the whole morning. You can't do that again. Ok, I'm sorry Sam. I'm going to get your wardrobe but we have to pick it up. - We have to shoot. - Ok. We have to do it now. Shit, dude, I'm sorry. I... Yeah, I know. What happened? I just got lost, that's it. I got lost. For three hours? I was yelling some of the time. Could you hear us yelling for you? No! What can we do, what do I... Just, you know, fucking nail it today. - Ok. - Just nail it. He's getting wardrobe, what else can I do? Here's your mic. Run this up through your shirt. Put that in your back pocket. - I'll make it up to you. I'm sorry. - It's ok. - We'll knock everything out. - Ok, great. Thanks. And, action! "Keep or trash?" - "Trash." - "Yeah." "Whoa, what are you doing?" "What, do you want that?" "Yeah, that's my favorite stuffed animal." "Mom gave it to me." "Hey, if you want it you can snuggle up with it tonight." "Cut it out, man." "Love you, Mom." - "Hello." - "Hi." "Mrs. Melbourne here?" "Who are you?" "I'm the groundskeeper." "I saw a strange car out here, I thought I'd check on her." "Yeah, that's mine. We're her sons." "We're packing up the place." "I guess no one told you, she passed away a couple of weeks ago." "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that." "You mind me asking how she died?" "We're not really sure, doctors think she had a heart attack." "Oh." Cut. Hold on, one second. Why is it that the doctors aren't sure? If she was suffocated, I feel like the doctors would be able to tell within two weeks whether or not she had a heart attack, or was murdered. I feel like I've heard of people that... The excuse would be a heart attack... I just think the audience is going to call bullshit on this and it just seems like a plot hole that we didn't really think through. It's not your fault, I was here with you through all this. I think Tyler's right. It makes this scene passé. I don't know how much that's going to affect us shooting later, because we have to work that in somehow. Let's say that the groundskeeper pushed her down the stairs and that everyone thinks that she had a fall. "You mind me asking how she died?" "She had a really bad fall." Ok, things are moving pretty good. Just wrapped our first scene where the groundskeeper shows up. Tom, great work. Killed it. Uh, huh. Now we're going to do a horseshoe scene! Alright. Good job. Alright, so come on out. Right there. Actually, it's a little too far. Perfect. Right there. That's where the sun is hitting your face. Yeah, that's going to be good. Alright, so if you're here... Yeah, creep behind the back just a little bit! You about ready to roll? Yeah, just setting up the shot! Ok, now come on out. - Exactly. Beautiful. - That's great. "Frazier Park," scene nine, take one. "You know, Louis, you were probably too young to remember this." "I think you were a little baby, I was outside in the front yard playing ..." Cut. Don't say Louis. Just say, "you know?" - Ok. - It's just too forced. Cut! This is to be added to that last take. Action! Oh, is that you? Yeah, sorry. Hey, you mind putting that on silent? Alright, we've gotta go again, sorry. We're losing sun here. - Sorry! - I know, I know. We'll do it again, last time I promise! Right now I'm dumping all the footage from the memory card onto hard drives. We don't really have time to sort through it and review it all. We're kind of in this "shoot-and-go" rhythm. That's what we get for giving ourselves barely any time to shoot this movie. Ok, final scene of the day. This is scene eleven, where the brothers find the picture frame. Ok, wait, say that one more time. This is where the two brothers find the picture frame. There's some weird feedback on your mic. There's like a "hum" or something. - How does that sound? - It's... - Hello, testing, testing. - Still hear it. It's the fridge. What? Fridge! He's right, it's the fridge. - Yep. - Ok. Yes! High-five. - Yes. - Nice. You know, common stuff, shooting in a house, you gotta turn off some appliances that make noise. Refrigerator. Air-conditioning. Common sense. Nice catch! Action. - "Hey dude." - "Hey." "Check this out. I found this in Mom's room." "What the hell?" "Do you think Mom did this?" "I don't know." "Why would she scratch out Dad?" "I know they had their differences but, I don't think Mom would do something like this." "So weird." "What?" "There's someone outside!" "What are you talking about?" "I just saw a person standing outside the door!" "There's no one out here." - "I swear I saw someone." - "Did you get it on camera?" - "Yes I did!" - "Play it back." "Hey!" "Yo, what are you doing?" "Just trying to scare whoever the fuck that was." "Let's go back inside, dude." - Alright, good job everyone! - Woo! - Seriously! - Good job, hey... - Right there. - Ok. - Great work. - High-fives! High-fives! That's a wrap on day one! - Wrap on day one. - We killed it. Good stuff. Oh, dude... Make sure we plug that fridge back in. - Yeah, I got it. - Nice. How about that, man? Congrats! - Day one. - Good stuff. Is that who I think it is? Yep, sorry guys. I gotta take this. Ya'll have a good night. Great job! Thanks, buddy! Alright man, so... Little interview here. Anything you want to say? Before we call it a night? - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Does that get distracting at all? What? The girlfriend. - Who, Jen? - Yeah. No, no. It's... Seems like he takes those calls all day. Yeah, well, he's moving to Indianapolis. He's got a lot on his mind. He's kind of getting things in order, you know? It's not distracting as a director is it? Does it bug you? Uh, no. No, it's all good. It's cool. I guess we're on schedule, so... Yeah, we're on schedule. It's all good. There we are. I'm slowly figuring out how to work this thing. Hi, there. Can't sleep. Filmmakers at work. Living the dream, guys. Living the dream. Tyler and Sam have gotten soft. And, we need a spark. Like rocks crashing together. A little "Film-101." All drama arises from conflict. So... Look at this. Hmm. Dude, you forgot to plug the fridge in last night. No I didn't. Yeah you did! I woke up this morning, it was unplugged. Now all the food's bad. No, last night you told me to plug it in, I remember plugging it in right before I went to sleep. Then why is it unplugged? Are you filming this? Hey, Tom. You're not even going to plug it in? No, I wanted you to see. I plugged it in last night. This food is still good. Psh. It's been sitting there for ten hours. I'm not eating it. It sat overnight. It's not going to go bad overnight. - This is fine. - Alright then you can eat it and get sick. What are you afraid of? Getting sick! Tom and I aren't eating that, right Tom? I plugged it in last night. Yeah, well maybe you forgot to plug it in when you took that phone call from Jen, huh? Very possible. Very possible, Sam! He never sees the monkey. He doesn't hear what we're talking about. So how does he know... We had this conversation earlier. - We did? - Yeah, he overheard! He's been stalking us so he's been looking through windows. He's been creeping out on us, he saw the monkey. He knows that it's special. And this is his message to you... Do you really think it's realistic that he heard that conversation through the front door? I don't know, what do you think? I can't, we can't just keep changing the script! We don't keep changing the script. This is... We did it earlier with the heart attack thing at the front door. We nailed down the script... Yeah, but we all agreed on that! Tom agreed on that one too! Look, this is all I'm saying... What if we're out by the grave, the dog's grave, and he sees us out there. He's like, "This is significant, they're grieving over a dog's grave." Then he takes the gravestone and it ends up on our front porch... No! We can't do that, because that scene happens after. When we see him out there, That's when he starts chasing us back, - So the whole gravestone thing... He would have already been terrorizing us, He can't just throw it on the doormat after that. He throws it through the window while we're in the house. Are we going to break a window in here now? I guess we can't break a window, but he does... Sorry, do you mind? We're actually in the middle of a... We're just trying to figure something out right now, sorry. It's not a good time. So here we are on the second day of shooting. As you can tell, these two guys are a prime example of "amateur filmmaking." With an emphasis on "amateur." We'll be lucky to get this done. But, I'm learning a lot. I'm glad to be here. I'm going to help them out as we go. There's a good story to be told here. And they're making the classic mistake of focusing on making their days rather than fleshing out characters. Alright. I'll get them focused. We're going to have a good story by the time we get to the end. "Frazier Park," scene fourteen, take three. "Come on." "How could you possibly know where you're going?" I'm just sort of, you know, figuring it out as I go. "Oh, that one. You see it?" "Yeah." "Alright, Louis, why don't you say a few words?" "Baron..." "You were an amazing dog." "Hope you're keeping Mom company up there." Sorry. It should sell, right? From far away? Yeah, I think so. Ok. Yeah, hold it up in the air. Yeah! Just like in the shop! Oh man. Tom, you're going to love this! Sam's you right now. Yeah, but a little bit more graceful. I don't want him tripping over this path. This should be good though. Cool. Yeah, we've gotta get this really quick. We're losing daylight. Hey man, we may have to run through this The sun's starting to go down. That's cool, right? Are we losing light? - Yeah. - Yeah. Sometimes when you're making a movie, daylight is not always your best friend. Gotta make due with what you got! "Hey man, do you think this is it?" "What do you mean?" "I mean after all this." "Do you think we're going to see each other again?" "Yeah. I want to stay in touch." "We'll make it work, right? I want to." "No, no, I want to too." "It's just that everytime we say we're gonna stay in touch, we end up lost in our own separate worlds again ..." - "Wait, hold on." - "What?" "Who is that?" "What?" "Wait a minute. Is that the groundskeeper?" - "What?" - "Yeah, here, look!" "Yeah, that is him." "Hello?" "Can we help you with something?" "Wait, wait. What's he got?" "Yo, what do you want?" - "Oh, God." - "Run." "Will!" I'm going to to some B.T.S. if that's alright. - Yeah. - Yeah, totally. - I'll get you guys. - Ok, cool. Au revoir. Beautiful day out, if you can see. Kinda blown out, isn't it? Look at that. Fun fact, whenever you're doing a scene like that... We just did the scene where I chase those guys with the blade. Real actors have to really go through that in their mind. Have to really kill somebody, just so they understand what that's like, to be motivated to kill. And, um... How to do it... In your mind. Fun stuff. We are rolling. Mic is on. Action. "Look, I don't know how much longer I want to wait in here for." "I think we're ok." "We haven't heard from him in hours." "He could be out there." "We can't just be in here forever though." "What was that?" "I don't know." "Shut the door!" "How is this happening?" - "Louis." - "What?" "I need to tell you something." "Ok." "I know I've been a bad brother to you." "I know that once Dad died, I just left." "And I left you and Mom here together. Just ..." Hold on. Line? Cut! Look, it's, "And if we make it out of this alive, I promise I'll be a better brother and be in your life more." Dude, you know this. Ok. What, did you not memorize this scene? It's been a long day man. - Ok. - Let's just do it again. - Just roll it, roll it. - Alright, we've been working - on this scene for the past... - I know, I know. hour so I'm just getting a little frustrated here. - Come on, alright. - Alright. - Ready? - Yeah. Rolling. Action. "Louis, I need to tell you something. "I know, I haven't been the best brother... when Dad left ..." Cut. Nope. Here, page seventy-two. Are you really going to throw a fucking script at me? Hey, Sam, if you don't mind, if I can just give you some advice? I think you're going in the right direction, you just need to forget about the words verbatim, and just tell your story. And know what you want, and go for what you want. In this case, it's an older brother, with a difficult past, who wants to protect his little brother. That's what you want in this scene, so just deliver that. No, it's a good note, but Sam, - Make sure you add the beat... - I like Tom's point on this. -No, it's a good note... I'm not going to use the script. I like that. I'm just gonna go from the heart. Not going to use the script. Ok. - Alright. Fine. - Let's get it. We'll get it. Hey, whatever. Let's give it a try. Let's give it a try. Rolling. And, action. "Louis... I need to tell you something." "I know I've been a bad brother to you." "When Dad died, I left you and Mom behind." "Alone. And I feel selfish about that." "I don't know if tonight's our last night together." "But I promise you, I will always be there for you." "I love you." "And I will never leave you again." - And, cut. - That was really good, Sam. - Really good. - That was ok? - Yeah it was. - Yeah. Hey, great note Tom. Seriously, that was good. That was great. Hey, maybe Tom should be the director. Ok, alright, enough of that. Well, he directed me better than you just did. - Uhh. - Alright, well... I think we got it tonight. - Yeah, we did. - Was that good? Yeah it was great. Well, I'm going to call it a night because I'm tired. You going to go take another call from Jen? Tell her I said, "Hi." Ok. Oh, Jesus. Look, it's not about the lines. It's more than that. Ok. You were right. What's that? He's so distracted. Look, that's why we couldn't get through the scene, he couldn't stop thinking about calling Jen. You see that, immediately after the scene he gets up to go talk to her? Yeah, I did. I did. - It's affecting the project. - Yeah. I could talk to him. I'll talk to him. - You're going to talk to him? - Sure. That would be great. I can't get through to him. You clearly have some kind of rapport with the director thing so maybe he'll listen to you. Hey, please. Alright? I need to get him back on track. Ok, I hope he does. You understand this, right? You see where I'm coming from? Yeah. I do. - I'll talk with him. - Great. - See what we can do. - Awesome, thank you. I appreciate it. Hey good work today. - Thanks, brother. - Yeah, no problem. I don't know how we're going to get through this thing. We have a couple of days to shoot. Every scene that we do, Tyler wants to change it up. Every night that we're here, it's like $120. So we're just burning through money right now. Why does he want to change it? Because he doesn't like it or something... Hey. Tyler wants to talk to you for some reason. I'm busy right now, can you give me a sec? He said it was important. It's ok. I'll wait. Alright, I'll be a second. Hold on. Yep. - What does he want? - I don't know. Sorry. Oh. Hi. Hi there, I'm Tom. I don't think we've met officially yet. Yeah, no, I've heard a lot about you from Sam. Is that right? How are things going over there? Well, it's gotten a little tense here recently. I think the boys are just discovering how difficult it is to make a film and it's starting to sink in now. Yeah, I mean, I told Sam it was a lot to take on right before he moves. So... You're a smart girl. That's what I've been told. Smart cookie. You're very pretty too. Oh jeez, stop. It's starting to make sense to me now. What do you mean? Well, he's been really distracted. He's distracted? Yeah there's something I should probably tell you. Hey. What are you doing? Just keeping Jen company that's all. Well, Tyler didn't want to talk, so can you leave? Sure. It was very nice meeting you, Jen. Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Bye. Alright, good night. Night night. What was he talking to you about? Fucking creep. Big dreamers never sleep. Watch! And listen! And react! Big dreamers never sleep. Big dreamers, never sleep. Big dreamers never sleep. No more distractions. You checked under your bed? Yes, I checked under my bed, it's not here. How about these drawers, there's a lot of... I didn't put my iPad in a drawer. Ok. No, there's nothing in these. No. I plugged it in and I left it right here. - I swear I did! - Check under your pillow. It's not under my fucking pillow. Dude. Hey, hey. Calm down. I think you took it. You took it. What? - You took it... - Are you serious right now? - You've been saying how... - Are you serious right now? You've been saying how distracted I am and I think you took it. You have been distracted, but I would never steal something that belongs to you! I have not been distracted. We've been shooting every day, I take these calls at night. I'm not distracting us at all. You have taken a couple during the day, ok? It's not fucking here anyway. We can't keep looking for your iPad. We have a long day ahead of us. We've already spent half an hour searching for this damn thing. Ok? It's in the house, where else would it be? - I don't know. - I didn't take it! You have to believe me! Look... I'm looking upstairs. Can you shut that off, please. Dude, dude. Enough, enough! We're done, alright? The show must go on. We're done. Come on, get in wardrobe. We're done. This is "Frazier Park," scene thirty-two, take seven. "Why are you doing this to us?" "I left the picture for you, thought you would have figured it out." "I was in love with your mother!" "And when she didn't return that love, I couldn't live, with her still alive!" "You killed our mom?" "Yes, now it's time to get rid of the evidence." "Louis, run!" "No!" - "You!" - "Oh, Jesus." "Oh, God! Oh, God!" "Louis!" "Oh, shit." "Nowhere to run." "Stay away from me you freak!" "Oh, no." "It's a long way down ..." "What?" "The only ground you're going to be keeping, "is the dirt in your grave!" "Will!" "It's ok!" "We're going to get you to a hospital, man." "Oh, God." He's running after me... Why would I still be shooting him? It's suspension of disbelief. It was a good scene, you didn't like that scene? No, I didn't. And you know what? A lot of these scenes I don't like. I know you don't like any of it. You've been changing every single thing since we got out here. Yeah, good. If it wasn't for me changing all these little plot holes, you wouldn't have a good movie. Great, well thank you so much. Sorry I couldn't help at all. - Sorry! - Fuck you. Whatever man. Look, you've been way too distracted with Jen, - with this move... - Oh, there it is! You haven't put any focus into this film. That's the point I was bringing up this morning. I knew you thought that way, so you took my iPad. Oh, my God! I didn't take your fucking iPad! - Yes you did. - No I didn't! Yes you did! - I'm so fucking done here. - Seriously? - I'm done at this cabin! - After all we've been through? You're just going to throw it all away? No, we're done. I think it's time to wrap this up. Fuck you, fuck you and your ego. Hey, bro. Hey. I heard you guys fighting outside. I think you guys need to just cool off. Maybe separate for just a minute here. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get you into this. No, it's ok. It's understandable. It's a creative environment, there's a lot of decisions to made. You guys are doing a great job. Why don't... I'll go talk to Sam. I'll get him squared away. Why don't you go for a walk, or why don't you go replace the groceries? Go get some fresh food. Is there a place nearby? Yeah. We just need to... That sounds like a great idea. - Ok. - I'm going. Alright. Sam? Hey Sam. I'm not in the mood right now. Can we not do that? How's it going? I sent Tyler to get some groceries, so that we could cool down, and pull ourselves together. Ok. I know you're stressed out. Moving is really difficult. Moving? You think that's why I'm stressed out? Well. I'm stressed out because this whole thing's a mess. We got this cabin, we've been out here for a couple of days, and it's already gone to shit. No. It's me and Tyler. That's what's stressful. He's changed the script so much since we've been out here. We had an idea nailed down, and he came out here, and he's just changing it every single day. No, it's not because of the move, it's this film. It was supposed to be fun, but it's not anymore. I'm moving, and I'm so ready to. That's not why I'm stressed. Ok, Sam. Sorry. Well, I hope we can pull it together and finish this film. Well, I don't think we're going to. I can't work with Tyler, not after today. I know, I know he took my iPad. Sam listen, I gotta tell you something... Tyler and I took your iPad away from you. - Are you serious? - And we hid it. Are you serious? It was a distraction, Sam. - I knew it. - We talked about this yesterday. Where is my iPad? - It was getting in the way... - Where is my iPad? - And we thought it was time... - Morris! - Where is my iPad? - make a good film... We're going to do that. - Bullshit, stop filming me! - Ok, ok! Where is my iPad?! Out by the firewood! - Sam! - This is bullshit! Sam. Sam. Sam, it's time to finish my film. Sam, Sam, Sam. Where are you, Sam? Oh, God. Stop. And scene. Ok. Let's see. Yeah. Over here. Yes. Ok. Ok. Let's see. No, no, no, no. I've got it! Here we are, ok. Mhm! There's something. Lighting. Let's try this. Ok. Little hot! Let's get a little drama! See if we can add a little drama to the picture! Specifics, guys! Making it real specific! Ok, ok. Clear these boxes out of the way! Good. Very good. Coffee cup. Adds a touch of humanity. What else? P.D. guys. It's these details that make the difference. Labels guys, labels! Legal's gonna be all up our asses if we don't turn these around! Ok. Oh! Refrigerator's plugged in! Get it? Well, I made a couple of changes to the scripts fellas! I wanted to talk them over with you. It's just the last couple of pages, I want to make a real clean cut. I think you're gonna like it. We'll just fix that up, what do you say? Let's put that in here. We'll talk about it later, shall we? Good! Did you hear that? The talent has arrived. This is "Frazier Park." Last scene, take one. Hello? Sam? Tom? Guys? Are you fucking kidding me? Un-fucking believable. Tom? So it's been a few weeks since I left the cabin. And I've been working really hard on this film. And I'm really proud of it. So... I've sort of gone back and forth about this but I feel like there's just one piece that's missing and it's closure on all of this. All the events that led up to meeting Sam and Tyler, and our time at the cabin have led to this moment, and this film. And the fact that I'm a filmmaker. It's a good feeling. I don't care what happens next, because... I got to do what I wanted to do, really, in the only way that I could do it, which was... no boundaries, no rules. And no one there to tell me how it could be done. So... So, there it is. I hope the whole world enjoys this film. I'm a filmmaker. Subtitles by explosiveskull
