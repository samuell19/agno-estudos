You are not stupid. Why are you so nice to me'? Because I'm your brother. Don't be nice to me anymore... I feel so poor and stupid. Misaki. You are always kind and smart... But I'm the one doing stupid stuff and get in trouble all the time. Misaki... We are not blood-related in the first place. I should leave this house and stop being your trouble. Never say such a thing! I need you to be with me! What do you mean'? I mean, I love you, Misaki. Not only as my sister, but as one lady. For a long time.
