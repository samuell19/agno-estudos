Now look come on man I'm really hurting here, please, I really need some. Nah ah ah ah. Four yellows. Four, it used to be two. Yeah well now it's four. That's all I got. Ah fuck! I have those property listings you asked for. Great, thanks. Anything else you'd like? Right well I'm heading home. Well as man once said, man can not live on bread alone. That was very deep for you Rich, who said that? Shakespeare? I think it was Benny Hill. Such a great philosopher. Look mate I'm busy. Jacob, you got a beautiful wife at home. What are you doing here on a Friday night, staring at Lisa's legs? Is everything okay? I'm fine Richard. I just wanna make sure all this is nailed before next week. All right have it your way, I'm going to head off. Are you okay to lock up? Well see ya. Okay. What on earth are you listening to? Hey honey I'm home. Anne, oh no! What did you do, what did you do hmm? What did you do, what did you do? What did you do? What did you do, what did you do now? It's positive. Another good wedding, thank you for your assistance once again. What is the matter, are you troubled? Just got a lot going on. Your mom is in God's hands. Good hands to be in. You have some time saved up. Why don't you take leave. - I don't need it. - Just a holiday Jovan. Some time to recharge. All right, I'll think about it. - Hey Ray? - Hmm? Can I borrow some money? - Again. - I know I know. I'm battling to keep my head above water. You try to help everyone. Atone for your past mistakes. Jesus said it is finished. The price has been paid, you understand? You need to look after yourself. I can't keep giving you money. You're a good friend. - Mr. Ackovic, hello. - Hello Cathy, any change? No still the same, not eating much, not really responsive. I'll be at my desk if you need anything. Okay, thanks. Oh, and this was attached to her file. Okay, thank you. Hello Mom, it's me. Oh, look at these eh? Why don't we get rid of them and put some nice fresh ones in? There we are. I had a great day today Mom, I did a wedding. For Uncle Popovich his boy. He married Bilyana Kovich. You remember them, great kids. was there, and they even got old Randy off his farm, they stuffed him in the soup. I love weddings, best part of being a priest. Except maybe getting to wear a dress on Sundays. Oh Mom. I wish there was more I could do for you. I'm trying hard, I really am. But nothing that I do seems to come to anything. I wish I can go back, to when I was someone. I was wondering where you were. Can't do funerals. Sorry mate, Anne was a great girl. I didn't deserve her, always focused on my bloody career, pushed her away, wasn't there. No one's to blame for this Jacob, it was accidental. She didn't mean to... She was having an affair. What? I wasn't there. I just... I just wasn't there. He gave her the drugs, I know it, I'll find him. Jacob you just can't... Don't give me one of your lectures Jovan, not today. I'm sorry mate. Yeah everyone's sorry. It doesn't really help anything. Hi. Good night, Drago, what are you doing here? Oh, just hoping that we could talk? If that's okay? Mate, I'm just about to go home. Yeah sorry I just, I really need to get this off my chest. Well come in, sit down. So what is it? I just wanna be a good person, but, I mean you know what I do. Yeah I know what you do, what about it? I think I want out. I don't know. I just feel like, I feel like I've got this constant voice in my head that's telling me I'm gonna go to hell if I don't stop selling death. You know my girl, Sarah, she's pregnant. She said that she'll terminate it. I wanted her to, but, I don't want her to. I think maybe, maybe I want a change. That voice in your head is the Holy Spirit convicting you, it's God telling you to stop. Tell Savor you want out. Are you kidding me? He'll kill me before he lets me leave. I'll help you if I have to. Do you think we could do it? Have a kid I mean. I don't know, do you? Maybe we could do it. I don't know. ♫ Nighttime, I'm telling you to not go ♫ I'm telling you not to go ♫ I'm telling you not to go ♫ Nighttime, I'm telling you to not go ♫ I'm telling you not to go ♫ I'm telling you not to go ♫ You know you live in a series ♫ You know you live in a series ♫ You know you live in a series Thank you. Nice work. The new songs are great. Thanks Lenny, I'll just grab a beer. Have faith girl you'll get there. I haven't seen you in forever, and now here you are, third time this week, can't get enough of my music eh? It's good. Can I get you another. Let's leave the past where it belongs. It's just a drink, don't flatter yourself. Another whiskey Lenny. Hey I was really sorry to hear about Anne. Yeah me too. Jay I know you're grieving and all but, trust me, climbing into a bottle isn't the way. My wife died of an overdose after having sex with some guy while I was staring at properties for sale in Leederville, so I think I'm entitled to drown my sorrows a bit, don't you? Fine do what you want? I just want to drink, in peace. Good to see you, Amber. Yeah you too, put it on my tab Lenny. Are you working the club tonight? Yep, maybe if you got some more people in this dive, you could pay me enough so I wouldn't have to. Yeah all right, stay safe love. I know you're hurting mate, but you didn't need to bite her head off. Hit and miss mate, , it's the perfect job. - Really? - We need a new team. Set up and get in... - Thought I'd find you here. - Hey. Hey, Father, what can I get you? I'm not old enough to be your father Lenny, scotch. So uhm, how's your mom going? Not so good. She hasn't got a lot of time left. On the house mate. To your mom. I'm sorry mate. to the funeral. I know you probably don't wanna talk about it. But I do wanna help. I appreciate it, Jovan. But right now I don't need your kind of help. Give my regards to your mom. That went well. He'll find you when he's ready. Yeah maybe. You found your way back to church yet Lenny? Maybe one day, but then I've gotta give up all this eh? Wow, taxi! Hi this is Dermott from DBT Investment Services, I'm sorry you've missed me, if you leave a message I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I don't care how he gets it. Okay, yes. Goodbye. You wanted to see me? I hear rumor that you don't wish to work for me no more. Yeah maybe. You don't like the money I pay you? No, no I do. It's just, I was talking to my priest and... My boy, your priest deals in fantasy, I deal in reality. You are my best dealer, you make me a lot of money. And that is reality. I just can't. You remember Timor Billic? No, should I? He wanted out same as you. So I let him. One piece at a time. I'd hate to see you meet the same fate. So, are you still my best dealer? Yeah. Yeah I'm your best dealer. That's good, I'm glad we had this discussion. You're not listening to me, what am I supposed to do, he's gonna kill me. I'll talk to him. I'm gonna have a kid Jovan, he doesn't need to have a dead drug dealer as a dad. I said I'll talk to him Drago. Yeah, well you better do something. I gotta get out of this. It's all right mate, I'll get it sorted out. No no no wait, wait what, I can get the money. Please, please, please. Too late for that. No no no! Blood pressure's not getting any better Jovan. Can't you give me something? I'll prescribe you some pills, but you need to take it easy, a holiday or something. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - No problem. So you've decided to help? I've just come in to see how close you are to putting him away. We'd be a hell of a lot closer if you decided to talk. So you've got nothing? How can you justify calling yourself a priest knowing you could help save all those lives being lost? We know who you are Jovan. If you testify against Savor you could put him away forever! We could protect you if that's what you're worried about. I'm not who you think I am, and you can't protect me against Savor. Is that so. Well when you've decided who you really are and if you wanna help, give me a call, until then stop wasting my time. All right, tell me again what you need from me, and I'll think about it. What do I look like, a charity? I'm begging you please, please. You know I'm good for it. Only two pills for 100. You're a legend. All right thanks man, I love you, you're really helping me out here all right. I appreciate it man. Yeah well next time come with the full amount. Yeah. I thought you went to work? I called in sick. Maybe I should get rid of it. What? The baby. I don't know if I'm ready for this and if you're still dealing. No I told you I'll get out. I've just gotta be careful that's all. I'll figure everything out. I promise. Still torturing yourself to stay honest? Better than the alternative. We were a great team, a great team. But here you are. Drink? Of course. Shame your memory isn't as good as your taste. What do you want Savor? You don't interfere in the business, that was the deal. I've always kept my mouth shut. You told one of my best dealers to get out. He's gonna be a father, he can't be doing that anymore. You made your decision, it's my business now. Understand? Better keep this locked up. White one sugar, just how you like it. - Thanks. - You okay? Yeah I'm good. Okay uhm, listen Jacob but if you need more time, I can handle your sales as well. Just let us know all right? Actually if you're cool to take care of things, I might head off a bit early. Yeah yeah yeah sure mate yeah. No no no I'm telling you this is a sure thing. You drop 500K on this and I will double it within six months. When have I ever let you down? David, David, David you know me, all right, this is a slam dunk, all you need to do is say yes. That's my boy, yeah, no great. No you go now, I'll call you first thing in the morning, excellent, speak to you soon. - Yes, hmm! - Good news mate? Just closed Houston, 500K. - Houston, that's fantastic. - Damn straight! 50K commission, another 10 in the pipe, yes, earn it! Get your on baby, yep, I just hit the jackpot and we are going out on the town in style! Yep I'll see you soon. Let's see. Okay. No Lenny not buying it, that's crap. Look I don't pretend to know the wine I've got... Hey Lenny can I talk to you for a sec? To be continued mate, yeah? Something's come up, I can't do my set tonight, can you cover? Oh yeah I could keep the house music going and extend happy hour a bit. - Okay. - Big day? Something like that. - Go on then, have fun. - Thanks. So, where were we? Police are stepping up the war on drugs, as two more lives have been tragically cut short by the potent new drug of choice, Blue Ice. This brings the number of deaths attributed to the party drug to 24 in only five months. Senior Detective Stacy Andrews spoke with Blake Arson about the current operation and how police plan to tackle the crisis. Hi-Yo, Silver! A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger. Hi-Yo, Silver away! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains, led the fight for law and order in the early West. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! The Lone Ranger rides again! Ho, ho boy! Wait a minute Cannonball, I'll help you. That's all right, Clem, I can manage! Soft-spoken, hard-driving, sharp-shooting. She had always been respected as the most honest stage driver in all Boone County. Until Clem Jones came to work for her. Hey Jovan, sorry to bother you. Not at all, perfect timing. I've just opened a bottle, I'll grab you a glass. Now you can't tell me, that's not a sensational drop. I think I've found him. Who? The guy Anne was having an affair with. How do you know it's him? His number was the last one in Anne's phone - the night she died. - Don't mean he's the one. I know it's him, you said you wanted to help me, - well now I'm asking. - Well how can I help? You used to know how to handle these situations. Mate I gave that game away years ago. Listen going down that road, it's not gonna bring Anne back. I know that but someone needs to pay. Why, so you can ease your own guilt? Are you gonna help me or not? Did I ever tell you about my brother Gorran? No, but, well what's that got to do with it? My brother Gorran is eight years older than me, and as long as I can remember he was with his girl, Charlotte. He had come one night, frantic. Mom said, where's Charlotte, where's Charlotte. They'd been out to dinner and they were walking home. And they were attacked by these two guys, they took Charlotte, and they slashed Gorran's face. They found her body in the morning. Why are you telling me this? Like you, he blamed himself and wanted someone to pay. He found those two guys, and took 'em down to the old Waterloo Salvage Yard. He got his justice, but it didn't fix anything, Charlotte was still dead and the grief and the anger were still there. Good story Jovan but it doesn't change anything. Mate you're going through a dark time, you might not see it, but the light always shines in the darkness, remember that. Jacob it's not your fault. You need to forgive yourself and grieve, not seek revenge. Maybe the best way to grieve is to get revenge. Thanks for the drink. Hello? Savor, it's me Jovan. Yeah one moment. I was not expecting to see you again so soon, come in. - Could have been all yours. - Not without sacrifice. You think I have sacrificed to get here? Sometimes, the things that hold most value are the things we can't see. How is it being a man of God, you think you are better than me. We both made our choices. And here we are, together again, in my home. Drago, he's a good kid, he wants out. Don't stand in his way, please. Ah Jovan, you were the best, no one could move product like you, we couldn't make it quick enough, you were that good. Worst mistake I made was letting you walk. I could've built this empire in half the time. Empire, is that what you call this? You're destroying people's lives, can't you see that? - I see you. - What? I've always got a chair for you, you want the kid out, - I will take you for him. - I'm not like you. This ain't me! You can lie to yourself all you want, but I see you, you will always be one of us, and that's my offer. You come back and I let him leave. Thanks for the drink. Hello? Ah yes yes hi Cathy. I'm on my way, I'm coming right now. She's very weak and she's been asking for you. Okay. Mom, it's okay, I'm here. Jovan... Milan, in village. Your, your father... Mom it's okay take it easy. You remember. Milan... Go see him. Milan, Dad's old friend? Your father say go see him. Mom, Dad's been gone for 15 years. Your father say you must do this. - Okay. - Your own father. Okay, I'll go and visit him. We're closing up now mate. You all right to get home, all right. You will always be one of us. - You're still here? - Yeah. It was a beautiful service for her. She will be missed. But she is in glory now. What's this? Are you serious? You and I, we're not cut from the same cloth. No one needs to see this yet, take some time to think about it. I've done my thinking, I'll be back in a few days to pick up my things. Do not decide such matters in the light of grief Jovan. Thanks Ray. Is that it? Yeah I know I'm short, I'll have more for you next week. Hey! What do you want? Get him outta here. You're lucky that Good Samaritan found you. A few busted ribs, smashed face. Some friends you have. They're not my friends. We know who you're working for Drago. I don't know what you're talking about. We found this on you. Anything you wanna tell us? Is Jovan here yet? Why do you wanna see the priest? I think that's enough for now. We'll come back later. - Well, well. - Detectives. Haven't reconsidered our offer? I'm just here to see Drago. Protecting your old mates puts others at risk. They're not my mates. So what's stopping you? - I'll give you a few minutes. - Yeah. Savor sent one of his men, said if I talked to you again, I'm dead. - What? - Am I a dead man? I asked for you help, and what have you done? - I'm really sorry Drago. - Yeah so am I. I'll make this right, don't worry. Yeah. I don't want your help, I don't need your help. Listen to me, I can't talk about this right now, come by the church on Thursday afternoon, and we'll talk then, okay? I know how to fix this. Ah! Told you. How is that even possible? Come on mate you're a priest, you're asking me whether God can work miracles? Sometimes you have to stop analyzing everything just listen. Listen to the voice of God, that still, small voice. He is talking to you mate, you just need to receive the message. Thanks Lenny. - Hey Jovan. - Not now Jacob. - Is Amber on tonight? - Seven o'clock. Geez you're late. Sorry Lenny, I just lost track of time. He's been waiting for you. Okay, thanks. Hey, Lenny said you wanted to see me. Hey Amber, this won't take long. Okay good because my set starts in 10. Oh okay, I wanted to ask you about Dermott Jackson. What about him? I saw you with him the other night. Are you following me. No I just happened to see you guys out together. Okay, what about him? I'm pretty sure Dermott was the guy my wife was with the night she died. What are you talking about? It's true, I found his number in her phone, he was the last one to call her. What's this got to do with me? I want you to find out if it was him and then tell me. Forget it, Jay, Dermott was just some guy I met in the club, there's not gonna be another date. Amber please, I have to know. No way, look I'm not getting involved in this. Amber... I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked you that. I just, been a bit of a mess lately. Maybe I'm a bit drunk now, but, I think I might've made a mistake all those years ago. I'll make it up to you, okay? I'll be here Thursday, come and see my set. - We can grab dinner after. - Okay. Order finally came through. Oh about time, the kid's probably got rid of all the evidence by now. We'll see. The cops are onto you, so you just need to keep your mouth shut until it all blows over. And then what happens? We'll talk about that later. Just make sure I can find you, both of you. All done? It's a customer. Blue Ice. We'll take the back way out. What have you done, what have you gotten us into? I'm just checking you're definitely at the church. Okay, I'll head there now. Just pack everything that you need and head to your mom's. I will meet you there. Love you. What are you going to do. Drago? Drago! Can I help you? Is Dermott in, I'm an old friend just in the neighborhood. Sure just wait a moment. Who is it Mommy? It's just someone to see Daddy, sweetheart. What do you want? Admit what you did. Sorry, I've got no idea what you talking about. Don't shut it. You killed her. Shut your, okay, outside and we will talk. But what happened was an accident. You gave Anne the drugs, you killed her. Me, what, no I didn't. You were there the night she died. Yeah but that doesn't mean... You gave her the drugs didn't you? No, no, Anne always got them herself, please I have a little boy, please. Anne got them? Yeah, Anne always got them. Liar! I'm not lying okay please, she is the one that got me hooked, please. Is everything okay out there Dermott? Ah yep everything's fine, be in there in just a moment. That guy you were with in Holland Park. That was the dealer? Yes, yes yes that was the dealer, yes okay, Anne gave me his number. Please you have to believe me, that's the truth, please. Ah thank God, thank God. I've got some things I need to take care of. But I'll be back. Hmm, I am pleased to hear it. What changed your mind? Don't know. Saw the light I guess. Well I'm glad. I need to talk to you. I'll leave you to it, I've got some house calls to make. - You okay mate? - I found them Jovan. - Both of them. - Both of whom? I've been following the guy Anne had an affair with, Dermott, he was there the night she died, and the dealer, I saw them both doing another deal. I thought you were gonna drop all this. I can't, I can't just let it go, every time I think about her, I think about him and it's killing me, I've gotta do something. You don't need to do anything, you don't even know those two guys you've been following are the ones. Look, I've gotta finish up a few things here, go home, I'll come around later. And we'll talk then. I thought it was him Jovan, Dermott, I thought he got Anne hooked on the drugs, but it was the dealer, it's his fault, it's his fault, Anne's dead because of him. I'm gonna kill him you know, I'm gonna kill him! Calm down, you need to calm down Jacob. - That's him. - What? That's the guy, he killed Anne. Wait here, I mean it, wait here. - Go on. - What's going on? I need you to get back into your car, I'll be done in a minute. - What's with this guy? - Get in the car. - I'll be done in a minute. - What's going on? Trust me Drago, get back in your car. No, I'm not going anywhere. What's his deal? He's just a friend, give me a minute. Hey you're not telling me everything. You want my help, stay here. You're friends with him? I'm his priest, I'm just trying to help him. He killed Anne. Calm down Jacob you don't know that. Calm down, aren't you listening to what I'm saying? That guy there, he sold the drugs to Anne, he's responsible. And you knew all the time. I knew he was a dealer, but I didn't know he was selling to Anne, how could I? You knew, you used to be one of them, you all look after your own, you son of a bitch. Don't you dare disrespect my mother. Now stay here and I'll deal with this. Sorry Jovan I need to do this. There's nothing, the house is clean. Let me out! Let me out! Wow. - I have to know. - Know what? How long were you dealing to my wife. - Man I don't even know you. - How long? I don't know what you're talking about. She died of an overdose, because of you. How long was she your client? I told you, I don't know your wife. Jacob come on. Come on Jacob! God help me find Jacob. You all right to go? Yeah, yep. You okay? Just thought he'd be here already. What's your history with him? That's a long story. Well I'm sure he'll be here. Yeah... - Get out, now! - All right all right! You don't need to do this, please. All right all right all right! - On your knees! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry man, I'm sorry all right. Please put down the gun. I'm gonna be a dad, you know my girl she's pregnant. I'm sorry all right I'm sorry. ♫ I'm going down to the river ♫ He won't take me back, I'm a sinner ♫ Soul and with him, but alone ♫ Solid gold, down to the river ♫ He won't take me back, I'm a sinner ♫ Soul and with him, but alone ♫ Solid gold, river Jovan. Jacob, you're at the salvage yard yeah? How did you know? I'll be there in a minute. I couldn't do it, I wanted to. But I couldn't. Something held me back. It held me back from pulling the trigger. I guess you were right, the light always shines in the darkness. I'm sorry Jovan, he... He... It's okay man, I'm almost there. Hang in there mate, you're still alive. You're late. Sorry. I screwed up. Might be a while before I can make it up to you. Blood pressure remaining stable. Keep the pressure on the wound. O2 stands at 97%. All right I'm in. So you want back in eh? That was the deal, me for Drago. Tell me, why do you care so much for this boy. He's only young, he's got his whole life ahead of him. Whereas yours is over, no? Something like that. I've never been good at anything else, except this. Ah at least my has returned to his senses. Come we drink to celebrate. And Drago? I'll spare the boy, for the moment. So you return at an opportune time my friend. I have 300 kilos merchandise to shift, and you are just the man. I'm listening. This phone has all the contacts and details of the drops pre-programmed in. More victims for your drug empire? You wanna shoot me? You'll be dead before your bullet reaches me. That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Police, police, on the floor, drop your weapons! Drop your weapon. - On the ground! - Drop that weapon! Savor Durich, you are under arrest. This'll come in handy before too long. He's okay, let him up. Next time stick to the script. In breaking news, police have raided Decadent Nightclub taking suspected drug lord Savor Durich into custody. The department had been tightlipped on the charges but it is believed new evidence has come to light, linking Durich with the Ice epidemic sweeping the city, along with...
