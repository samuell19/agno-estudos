Stop confusing me. I paid eight lakh rupees in total, right? -Yes. Interest rate of 2.5%, correct? -Correct. Three months later, it amounted to 9,15,350 rupees. Right? Yes, but what about the two and half lakhs I gave you earlier? That's for three months later. Amounts to 7,15,377 rupees. Interest charged at 3%! What? 3% interest for seven lakh rupees? Follow the math or not? You're dressed like a groom, sir! Is it your wedding day? What's the deal, sir? Today, everyone's booze should be on you! And you're asking me? Get going and go get married! You heard him. Get going! You'll be back after the wedding, anyway! Please leave. At first, I gave eight and a half lakhs. Yes, but I paid back two and half lakhs sometime ago! That's at 2%, man! I'm talking about 3%! No, you're wrong. Awesome, sir! You nailed it! Who is this guy? Like a computer that has sprouted limbs! You're no ordinary guy! You're one of a kind! Come along! Hey! Get up! Waste of space! Scoot over to the corner! Have a seat! You solved a huge problem without batting an eye! What's eating you? I'll tell you. But, my ego can't handle it. Order a large round. Hey! Get us a full bottle! Here you go, sir! He's drinking it like it's mother's milk! Balu. That name signified a genius! It was a brand name! Good grief! Hold it right there. "Balu signified a genius. A real brand name!" Go beyond that! First in the state in high school! First in the state in junior college! Ditto in the entrance exams, too! After all that, you expect me to have my feet on the ground? I was just soaring in the clouds! Generally, I don't believe in luck. But, as if to make me believe in it, my bad luck arrived by train! Got a good look at my bad luck? Like algebra clad in a half-sari... Like cute-smiling quantum theory... To increase my irritation by a factor of infinity... ...she came from Coimbatore by train! Here's the kicker. The one who awoke, left for the station... ...reached the station, all within the auspicious hour... ...to receive my goddess of misfortune, was none other than my father! Hello! How are you? -I'm doing great! Shall we go? What about my luggage? What? You expect me to carry that? If so, I'll return back home! I was just kidding, dear! What, dear? -Did you see that? Where? -A picture of Balu! First is in the state is no joke. Looks great! Hi 'mama' (maternal cousin)! 'Mahalakshmi has arrived at my house!' Hello aunty! Is my chicken ready? I've already added masala to it. Just a few minutes and it will be done! Stop! Masala is for the chicken. You might apply it on her! Oh, stop! Come on in! This is your room! Also, no matter what, don't go upstairs. Why? -Because, Balu's room is up there! Why? -He's very strict! He bounces hard! His name even sounds like 'ball'! Don't you know English? Why did you come here? -Who are you kids? I'm Fourth. -Fourth grade? No! That's my name! How so? -This is how it works here! No names! Only ranks! Balu calls us by rank only! He doesn't have a name yet. Because, he hasn't passed an exam yet! He failed in Tamil! What? Failed in Tamil? -Nowadays, that is the in thing! Who are you all? How did you get here? That is a long story! We came here for grandma's birthday. I told them that we'd have cake and leave. But, he suggested that we stay for dinner! Until then, he said we could play cricket! We did play cricket, but he hit the ball hard! Our bad luck, the ball ended up in Balu's room. It landed right there! The ball was in Balu's hand! I asked him to give it to me. He asked what was two multiplied by two. Stop. How much is two multiplied by two, sis? Qualified! That's what I said! And since that day, I've been here! What about your parents? Some parents they are! Until I become like Balu, they made me to stay in Balu's room! He's right. As a matter of fact, my eyes are fine! Because Balu wears spectacles, I'm forced to wear them, too! Regardless of all that, I love this room! This isn't a room! This is a prison! Look at this! We even wear uniforms at home! Uniforms at home? I can't believe this. Sis! Don't touch anything there! -Why? Whatever you touch, he'll find out! He's a walking closed circuit camera! Is that so? So if I took this pen and put a cap on it, would he figure it out? Just take a look at the table. People use pens to give marks on exam papers. This guy marks pen positions! Similar to that, he puts powder on the computer's mouse! He opens up a pen and marks around it! He places books in precise angles! He changes up pieces on a chessboard! These are Balu's tricks! You didn't do anything, right? If you did do anything, he'll really do us in! Hey! You never told us who you are! Who am I? I'm Balu's bride-to-be! Balu has no relatives! Only ranks! When Balu comes by, he won't ask you how you're doing! He'd only ask what rank you are! Balu is nothing like that! I know him very well! Someone was in my room. It's just me, 'mama'! What is your name? Why? Don't you know? I don't keep track of unwanted things. Veeravenkata Satyasai Nagadurgadevi Sitamahalakashmi. A hundred and twenty kilobytes. I can't waste so much space on you. Shorten it! What's your rank? I'm first in the district, 'mama'! When it comes to singing! (sings classical song) I meant in studies! Your score in your first year? Well, that... is... 55 percent. Do you know my percentage? That's why I came here to join in your college! That's my score! Not that of the college! On the way to the house, I saw a huge banner with your picture! It was awesome! The one in the college bus stand is even cooler! Coffee, 'mama'? Look at that timetable. What is this? -Green Peas Masala! I can't waste so much memory on this! Shorten it! Sala! How can you serve chicken in our house, aunty? I made some because Mahalakshmi loves it. Eat, dear! Thanks, aunty! Sis! Why not? That's chicken, sis! Yes, it's chicken! But, today isn't Saturday! Oh, so you don't eat chicken on Saturdays? No, I don't. From now on, every day is Saturday! Why? -Balu hates chicken! If so, I'll go back to my hometown. Get up, sis! You may sit. Chow down! -Okay! The good lady loves meat, does she? What is your percentage? Say it for everyone to hear. 55 percent. Which stands for 'second class'! The brain won't work if you eat meat. She is living proof of that! What happens if you eat meat? -The brain won't work! Mop! Bro? -Get that chicken out of that plate! Started already? Take the leg piece from her hand! So much for your chicken, huh? Oh no! My chicken! What is it? Eat! I'm leaving, mom! Wait! Take Maha with you! No can do! -Why? That girl is new to the city as well as to the college. She was brought here to study with you. Could you please drop her off, sir? Let him go ahead, mom! I'll drop Mahalakshmi off at college! You can drop her off today. Who will do it tomorrow? Let him do it. Sorry, man! Tie it yourself! I'm ready! Let's go! Go and get a glass of water. Here you go, 'mama'! Drink! Go and return the glass. Maha! For dinner, shall I make chicken fry or chicken curry? Both, aunty! Some curry and some fry! Cancel the chicken, aunty! Did I tell you to sit? Now sit. Get down! Why, 'mama'? Call me 'mama' only at home! In college, you must call me 'Balu'! A share auto will come by! It'll take you to college! 'An exam is like an ex-lover!' 'It'll infiltrate your memory and torture you infinitely!' 'At the age where one is meant to spent soaring in the air...' '...who the hell decided that it must be spent poring over books?' 'At the age meant to be spent practically in love...' '...who the hell forced all these theories into our life?' 'Oh God! We wished to soar!' 'Too bad! We don't have a wing!' 'Oh God! This is a colorful age!' 'Too bad you bent it beyond repair!' 'He who does everything right, that's Balu!' 'There is no one quite like him! Understand that well!' 'We sought to get an Oscar!' 'Mr. Rahman beat us to it first!' 'We studied hard so we could get that first rank!' 'There's Balu in our way. No way to get there!' 'Instead of watching films or listening to music in the restroom...' '...read formulae and grow smart!' 'Read the content of your syllabus...' '...with the same interest you have with those colorful magazines!' 'Oh wow! Really hit the nail in the head, Balu did too!' 'Is there anyone here quite like him? Is there? Is there someone at all?' 'He who does everything right, is Balu!' 'There is no one quite like him! You better that, dude!' Buddy! The results are out! Who's the second rank? -Ajay. Give us a treat! Why must I give one? Didn't you come first? Here, the rule states that the second ranker must give a treat! Give out your orders, guys! I didn't bring my wallet! Stop it, guys! Listen to me! Did you see that? My 'mama' is always on top of his class! It is this college's tradition... ...to name newly constructed blocks after first rank holders. I always knew you'd be the one on top! Therefore, I've already named this block after you! You've changed the rule of first rankers being the ones to give parties. I have a small desire. Just once, come second. I'm sorry, sir. You will never get a treat for me! Here you go, sir! -Thank You! What gives, 'mama'? You seem so dull despite being college topper! Had I come first, know what I would've done? What would you have done? -I'd say "That is Mahalakshmi!" Don't dream that big! That will never happen! She calls you 'mama'? Aunt's daughter? You smoke? Only to ensure no one says I'm a topper because I have no vices. Does the smell come across? No. Love letter for you! -From who? Deepa? How did you know? She was the only one who hadn't sent one yet. Read it. "O future Bill Gates..." "You have beautiful eyes!" Underline that. "Your spectacles are really dandy, too!" Underline that, too. "But, they don't suit you." Scratch that. -Which one, 'mama'? The first thing you read. Which? The one about your "beautiful eyes"? That one? -Hey! "You ride the bike very stylishly!" I've underlined it! Underline it again! "But, one more important thing..." "Leaving that pretty cousin of yours behind at the bus stop, isn't cool at all!" Quit using your brain too much and simply read what is written! Didn't you say that your cousin Balu is a good guy and stuff? Now look what happened! He left you behind at the bus stop! I don't even mind that! But, he has told me not to call him 'mama' at college! That is so hard for me! So what? Be irreverent as hell with him! He's my cousin, man! A two year feud, sis! Two years! Just because I honked his bike horn, he slapped me hard in the face! I will not rest until I get my revenge on him, sis! Even that's fine! My name is Arjun. Lovely name to hear, right? But that guy? How dare he refer to me as 'Sixth Ranker'? I will not spare him, sis! Sis! I don't even brush my teeth with these fingers! But, he made me wash his bike with it, every day! Hey! Get the water! Look at this picture, sis. This is what I looked like, before I came to this house. Constantly lugging water in here, made me like this! He wears my clothes now! Look how he pinched my thigh because I touched his computer once! What is this? Such a huge birthmark? Not a birthmark, sis! I marked the spot to ensure I wouldn't forget it! Why so silent, sis? I have project work tomorrow. Need the computer for it! Have you forgotten the rules, sis? That is a topper's computer! You can't use it! Topper, my foot! If he's got the guts, ask him to fail once! Only if one is a topper, can they use the computer? What's wrong if sis uses it? Nothing wrong with it! Nothing at all! So the computer is needed, right? -Yes! Very much so! Come, sis! I'll request the computer be given to you! Silence! Move slowly. Don't push me, fatty! Don't be afraid, sis. Come along! Move aside, all of you! I'll go wake him up, sis! Hey! Stop! It's nothing, 'mama'. Just a small doubt... What? Is it if two plus three equals four or five? No... They've stated the value of 'x' as two and that of 'y' as three. How do I substitute the value of 'x' in this equation? Please teach me, 'mama'. What is that, 'mama'? A hyperbola curve! That's a circle, right? No. It's the centre. What is 'ae'? Asked you what 'ae' is, in math. That which is between length and breadth, right? State board, huh? Didn't study, eh? Don't study! Why must girls study? When a guy studies day and night and acquires a well-paying job... ...you folk casually end up marrying him and through his hard work... ...you'll chill throughout life! Isn't that right? Wait. What happened yesterday while travelling with me? What do you mean, 'mama'? Don't play dumb with me. We came upon a speed breaker. I pulled on the brake. The bike jumped up a bit. Then, you leaned upon me. Your chest collided with my back. Your breath was pretty scorching, too. And you know it, too. But, you didn't move at all. You remained in place. Your heartbeat was pretty fast, too. That means you felt something! As I am mature, thankfully nothing came of it. Had anyone else been in my place, they would've taken undue advantage. Get going. Hold it right there. Did you eat chicken? -No! Give me your hand! Kids shouldn't be watching this! Run along and study! Run along. Here's what I understand from this. What's that? From now, we must never send her to Balu's room alone! Grandma! What is it, dear? What happened? I'll fail in this examination, grandma! I couldn't understand anything! You're crying over this! Stop! Wipe those tears! No, grandma. Send me back home! You lunatic! I'll go home! Aunty! What is it, dear? Why are you crying? Tell me what's wrong. I don't understand anything that is taught here! Everything is taught in English! Would anyone cry over this? I won't be able to pass! -Don't worry! You'll be able to learn it. I'll teach you. Don't cry! What is it, dear? I'll flunk in this examination, uncle! Is that all this fuss is about? I don't understand anything that is taught here! Listen. Do you know how much I fought with your dad to bring you here? You must not cry, okay? No, uncle! I'll fail this exam! Look what I've brought for you! Even so, I'll go back home! O dear chicken! I'll flunk! You really like this, right? -I don't understand any of this! I'm leaving! Please drop me back to my hometown! I don't know how to console you. Because, I can't imagine the pain of those who flunk. Because, I've never flunked an exam yet! You were babbling on and on about going home? Is this a motel for you to come and go as you please? Anyone who does not study, will only fail! Think you'll pass if you cry? Just try studying once! I'll even help you out! If you fail even after that, I'll drop you home myself! How many times have we failed? You can drop us home, right? This is my 'Arjuna' timetable. Since I'm brilliant, studying an hour per day is sufficient. If I study for an hour, you must study for five. Here. These are my books. If you have any doubts, ask me. 'O revered Ganesha...' 'The one with fiery eyes...' 'Poetry and red flowers offered, only to praise thou!' 'Honey and millets, for thou to feast!' 'Gently cast thine eyes upon us!' 'Thou art the mighty Lord, as inscribed in the scriptures!' 'Leave us at ease with your grace!' 'O benevolent one, who gives boons to our extended hands!' 'O omnipotent one, who protects us from within!' 'O caregiver, who releases our burdens and unites us!' 'O protector, who dispels miseries and lights up life!' 'O caretaker, who bestows good and detaches burden!' 'Gently cast thine eyes upon us!' 'Thou art the mighty Lord, as mentioned in the scriptures!' 'A centum score, I do not seek!' 'Please help me just to pass this test!' 'The IQ of a scientist, I do not want!' 'Should thy look to give it, do so quickly!' 'The high marks that puts my face on a banner...' '...I do not want.' 'A last bencher, I am!' 'Help me just a bit to do little better!' 'O revered Ganesha...' 'The one with fiery eyes...' 'Poetry and red flowers offered, only to praise thou!' 'Honey and millets, for thou to feast!' She must have definitely flunked! She would've passed! As she expected, she didn't flunk. As you expected, she didn't pass. Then what happened? I had a dream. A hilarious thing happened yesterday, Maha! What was it? I had a dream where you were the first ranker! Everyone was congratulating you! I couldn't stop laughing! The result is out, Balu! Who's the second ranker? -You! 'Mama' is second rank? -What are you saying? Yes, man! What about the treat, Balu? Why must I give a treat? The second ranker must give a treat, right? That's the rule! Give out your orders, guys! One cold coffee, one Pepsi, a sandwich, an ice cream, a 'lassi', bro! For the longest time, I wished to give a female name to this block. You've fulfilled my wish! It's like the Goddess of wealth herself has come down upon us! For the longest time, I wanted a party from Balu. Today, that wish has been fulfilled, too! I was just kidding about wanting a party! But, you fulfilled it anyway! Do I mean that much to you? Move aside! It's okay. He likes me! A love letter, 'mama'. Did Roja give it? She can't just take a hint, can she? Not for you, 'mama'! It's for me. For you? Who gave it? Over there. Oh no! Thought he wouldn't come, but here he is! How dare you give a love letter to my cousin? Get lost! It wasn't me. He did it! -Beat it! He's hitting you, right? Don't just stand there! Moron! Get on! Damn it! Would you accept a love letter from anyone? Mustn't you slap him right there? Good grief! Taking care of her is a big enough task for me! Am I her watchman? If anything happens to her, who is responsible? Heard that Mahalakshmi came first in class! I'm very happy! I'm making chicken for my sweetheart, tonight! What bloody first in class? Someone gave her a love letter! Ignoring that, you talk about this? Listen up! Anyone can be a topper! But, is that important? One's character is important! Don't you know that? -What are you babbling about? Hey kiddo, Mahalakshmi came first in class, huh? Yes, she did. Who taught her the subject matter? I did, right? How could she not top the class after that? To improve her confidence level, I didn't write the exam properly. What? You didn't write many exams in college well? Grandma? -Yes? Some schmuck gave your granddaughter a love letter. Aren't you ashamed? -Oh stop! No way it can beat the love letters I received by the ton in my youth! Nobody cares about a damn thing! Why should I do so? Do what you wish! Why are you getting so worked up? Is it because I got a love letter or that I came first in class? Seems like something's burning. Have your soda pop. Want some? Who was that guy who said eating chicken is bad for the brain? It was some brainless guy. Never mind him! What? Password required? Dad! -What is it? Who changed my system's password? -Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi? -Yes. Why did she do that? -Hey! Didn't you say that whoever ranks first gets to use the computer? As you were ranked second, the computer would go to her, right? I'll deal with this! -Maha! Yes, uncle? -Please give him his computerâ€™s password. Now it is my computer, uncle! Poor chap. Please tell him the password. Passwords can't be disclosed in public! It won't be secret anymore! I'll eat this chicken piece and open it for him myself. That won't be necessary! Besides 'Chicken 65', what else would you care about? I'll handle it myself! -Okay. He wasn't scolding you, but the 'Chicken 65'. Don't be upset! What are you all doing here? Go and sleep! Hurry up, fatty! Else, he'll rip you to pieces! You mini-eggplant! What did you set as the password? I can't figure it out! Let's try this. Wrong password again? Good grief! My eyelids are getting a tad heavy... Don't fall asleep, Balu! Don't fall asleep! "My goodness! You're really hot!" Mahalakshmi is 'hot'? "With such a beautiful girl by his side, how is Balu able to study?" "Have him clean his glasses first and then take a look at you." "God damn! What a lovely hip!" "I could stare at that hip all semester long!" "Only upon looking at your hip, would they have discovered the circle!" "Or hell, they would've modeled the moon in the sky off of you!" "Also, I think the number zero was invented..." "...only to measure your waist!" "You've made me understand such lovely mysteries!" "Yours truly, your dear lover." Oh no! Aunty! Didn't mean to! I'm sorry! -Aunty! Oh dear! -Aunty! I came to be with two feet. She reduced me to all fours! Oh no! She's knocking! -Open the door, aunty! All because of this damn hand! -Please open the door! Mom! -What happened, dear? It is... Please don't say it! Pretty please! It's... -What happened? Tell me. It is... No... it is... What's wrong? What is 'it'? Please help me, God! My head aches, aunty. Please give me some 'Zandu Balm'. -Is that all it is? Hold on. Because I am mature, it's all good, 'mama'. If not, what would've become of you? This isn't for me. It's for you! 'That is Mahalakshmi!' 'Quite the decisive victory, she has scored indeed!' 'She turned the King of Kings into King Kong!' 'With a single leap, she overtook him!' 'Overnight, she became a wonder woman!' 'If two minuses equal a plus, two pluses equal minus!' 'She changed that equation and went straight to the top!' Stop it, guys! He's bearing his soul with a heavy heart and you're all praising his cousin? Here you go, bro. Hold it and drink up! Once this is in, all else will be out. Shall I give you an idea to become class topper? Imbecile! What he's saying is a flashback! How can you swoop in and give pointers? -That's exactly why I'm doing so! Go ahead, my dear. Go ahead. You start from the beginning, bro. But, do so in a way where you are the topper! Who the hell let you in here? Give me that! Here you go, bro. Pour your heart out after pouring this in. Doesn't Tendulkar himself score zero at times? Don't feel bad. What if he ends with a zero once again? That was my fear, too. In order to be a topper, I went straight to a KFC restaurant. Bought a full bucket of chicken. I ate one leg piece. Two ideas came about. 'Jealous of the cat, turned the giant elephant!' 'Google and Yahoo in a big, big fight!' -I'm going to the playground! 'Rather than relying on courage to win...' '...he resorted to trickery!' 'Became a real trickster, he did!' 'He indulged in fraudulence day and night!' 'He makes the tension meter soar!' 'He tortures like a speed breaker!' 'Without counting, he creates confusion!' 'Without a reprieve, he raises the blood pressure!' 'His acting cannot be endured!' 'His cheating couldn't be tolerated!' 'His fights haven't changed!' 'His strategic planning shows no signs of retreat!' 'He crafted a meticulous timetable!' 'Like a needle in a clock, he runs without a moment's rest!' 'Cheating! The fire nears the cotton!' 'Cheating! The tiger nears the deer!' 'Cheating! The storm nears the flower!' 'Cheating! The sky nears the handkerchief!' You idiot! Why are you pouring rice on the floor? Why are you infuriating me, ma'am? Lot of ghosts roam about at night here! Ghosts normally come in darkness, right? But this one seems to wield a firebrand! It comes with a light! Yes! Now I understand, too! What is that? -My alarm time changes by itself! My books go missing! When I go to the bathroom, the door locks itself! I can't even open this damn ring! Yes, mom. The same thing happens to me! Come closer. Why are your eyes white like that a ghost? If a ghost roams about the house all night, who can sleep peacefully? Am I not scared of ghosts, too? -Absolutely. I'm going, dad. To sleep peacefully! Mop! Pour some rice in my room, too! You got it! All of this is for you. Eat well! Oh no! Aunty, it's Saturday! My goodness! Now what do we do? Saturday has transitioned into Sunday! Therefore, I can eat chicken! It smells like someone is studying in here! So 'mama' is the firebrand wielding spirit? The ghost, huh? Got scared thinking it was Mahalakshmi! So he's been studying every night without your knowledge. In the guise of a ghost, no less! He's playing a major cheating card! Do not forget this as long as you live, sis! Fortunately, that chicken piece saved you. It isn't wrong if you a build a temple for that chicken piece! For memory power, he eats Saraswati holy paste! So it's not by his own brain, eh? I thought he was genius. But, he's nothing but a doofus! Order ten boxes of that stuff for us! You guys have no idea how to study. But, don't you at least have a way to ruin someone's studies? After this, you must not spare him, sis! You must disturb him! You must disturb him in a way that no one can even imagine! Do you get what I'm saying? What are you saying? Balu must be infatuated! Grandma! Look at what she's doing to distract me! She's not letting me study! She's just a kid, man! Her? A kid? She's exposing herself! Stop blabbing! 'A war has broken out between the cat and the rat!' I'm going to play! -Aunty! I'm going for badminton! 'The fights and quarrels shall never cease!' 'The spider has trapped the tiger with ease!' 'She has removed a thorn with a thorn. She has extinguished fire with fire!' 'A mirror effect, she has exuded!' 'A glass of water has turned into a tsunami!' 'She trapped him with his own tricks!' 'Without much ado, she has crushed you-know-who!' 'She enjoyed playing tit for tat!' 'She relished making him slip and fall! What a gal!' Pipe down, guys! I'm confused enough as to who came first! Who was the topper? Tell us, bro! Why are you late? Results are out today, right? So, I went to seek grandma's blessings. Because I got her blessings last time, I came first. A little sentimental touch. Okay, now get on. Maybe grandma's blessings do have a lot of divine power! Why risk it? Let me take a shot. Hey! Hold on to the bike. Hold it quickly. I'll be back in a minute. Hold on. I'll be right back! No one's around. Where are her feet? Dad! Hey sweetheart! Are you well? Get the luggage! Welcome, uncle! How are you? I'm good. How about you, Balu? -I'm fine. Have some coffee. -Sure! Quite the surprise visit, brother. What's the occasion? All good news, dear. I'm looking to get Mahalakshmi married sometime soon. Marriage for Mahalakshmi? What's the rush for that? The thing is, a good alliance has come by. The groom is excellent. He stays here, too! They didn't ask for dowry, either. The father of the groom has seen Maha somewhere. He was very impressed. He wanted to finish the wedding soon... ...and take her with them to America. You're absolutely right, uncle! Do not delay! Keeping an eye on her every day at college is quite the chore! She gets so many love letters! The entire college is head over heels with her! I know she'd go to America after marriage. If not, who knows where she'll go... Stop this needless blubbering! Excuse me, son-in-law... Don't misunderstand me. Poor motherless girl. My son brought her here from afar so that she'll have a good education. At this time, why rush to marry her off? Please wait a while. Let her finish studying. After that, I'll find a good alliance and get her married. She's a girl child, right? What is she going to do after studying beyond this? There is a lot of difference... ...between your desires and my desires for her marriage. What you said right now, is totally and completely accurate! Girls must not be allowed to study a lot! If done so, their husbands would end up hating them! Chances are they might desert them, too! Like how grandpa left grandma! Shut your damn mouth! Your grandpa didn't leave me. I was the one who pushed him away! All these years, without expecting anyone's help... ...I stood on my own two feet and raised all of you... ...and brought you all to a respectable standing! Tell your son to watch his tongue! Can't you be quiet? I'll take your leave. Alright, brother. But anyway, think this over. Dad! That boy wishes to meet you in person. He'll meet you in your college campus on Monday. Take care, dear. Hey Hema! Why bother studying hard? Some guy has already been born, has studied hard, will get a great job... ...earn a lot of money and seek your hand in marriage! Why bother studying hard? -'Mama'! Take Mahalakshmi for example! As I said, without any hassle, she will get married! Her wedding's next month! Rather than wasting time with studying... ...you ladies hit the gym and lose weight! Why are we guys around? To protect folk like you, right? Quit worrying! Listen to me, 'mama'! I don't want to get married! Don't tell anyone about this! This time, I'm coming first! Not just this time, but every time from now! 'Cause, you're getting married! What gives, 'Result' Kumar? Why so glum? The results are out? -Yes. It has? -Mahalakshmi... What's her score? She scored 95%. What about me? You scored 96%. I knew it! Knew I'd come first! Guys! This time, the first ranker will give a treat! Eat whatever you want! It's on me! Sorry, buddy. Ajay's the topper. He scored 97%. To name the block, I was yearning sadly for someone whose name started with 'A'. You've crushed my unhappiness! Our dear Balu, sir! I'll do it! If second rankers always give parties... ...their family fortune won't cover it! Here on in, no more parties. Just studies! The final exams are coming! Whoever comes first in the final exam... ...their name will be set as the permanent name of this block! It could be Balu or Mahalakshmi or even Ajay! Okay? If so, name it after me right away! Listen up. The topper must be either you or me. We mustn't let anyone else get there! Okay? Mission two. We mustn't let Ajay study! Mission one. Stop my wedding! If so, I have a condition. I have a condition, too. Never say "That is Mahalakshmi!" Never ask me for your computer password! I'm weak in embedded systems, 'mama'! I know. I'll help you. You're weak in virtual reality, 'mama'! I know you'll help me with it. What if we start fighting and end up not talking? Who must talk first? Let's flip for it! Heads, you talk first. Tails, I'll talk first. No can do. Heads for you. Tails for me. No way! -Then I can't, either! To decide who is heads and who is tails, let's flip for it now. Alright. If heads, your tails. If tails, I'm heads. Lovely! 'Will she come to rock my world?' He's here, buddy. I'll handle it. Mahalakshmi, huh? She was with me at the pub until 2 AM last night! She drinks hard! She drinks 7-Up? -I'll smash your face! Cocktail, man! -The heady mix of spirits in a bowl, yes? She drank way too much last night. So I had Sandy drop her home. But, I don't know where he dropped her. Sandy? -Sandy of the second floor. Why is the chick alone? Seems no one's fallen for her yet. Hello? -Tell me. Where are you taking me? Hold this. Looks like dried coriander! Like you don't know! -I don't! What is this stuff? Marijuana! Marijuana? What the hell? So you're the guy whom Mahalakshmi sent? She smokes marijuana? I've checked here and that floor. You seem like the nephew of the "Anniyan" character! Do you want Mahalakshmi? I want her in full! And you? Ask me! Ask! Ask me who I am! I just asked you! -Why did you ask me? Ask this garbage bin! Ask these leaves! Ask these bricks! Ask anyone in this campus! Why in blazes did you ask me? You let loose and came before me! I'm Dhoni, man! -What? Dhoni? What's the matter? Can't I be Dhoni? Sure you can! -I'm Anthony, man! Why change your name all of a sudden? I'll switch names but I'll never switch girlfriends! Because, Mahalakshmi is my lover! No... Mahalakshmi is my life! Oh dear! I will not give Mahalakshmi up to anyone! No one can separate me from Mahalakshmi! Let me go, guys! I'll tell you about Mahalakshmi. What is it, dear boy? They said she drinks hard, huh? They said she smokes marijuana? Who said it? -Them! Don't believe any of it! Crap! All is ruined! What are you looking for? My feet? Want my blessings? You can have it after it's done. Do you know something? -Ribbon head! See the model of this block here? We're about to name it after Mahalakshmi! That one? -She has absolutely no vices! Why the hell is he blabbing about? But, three months ago... Three months ago? She, who was the class topper... ...had her heart broken by her lover, Joseph. They said his name was Anthony! Be it Anthony or Joseph! Even if the names are different, the religion is the same, yes? True... what? A young girl, right? She couldn't bear her broken heart... ...couldn't sleep at night... ...smoked a lot of marijuana... ...boozed heavily... ...spent way too much time in the pub and her life transformed for the worse! She seems to have every vice there is! Far as I know, she doesn't have the habit of smoking cigarettes. She's a lovely girl! I have it, guys! 'O rapturous belle!' 'Are you but simmering honey?' 'My heart leaps for you!' 'Anywhere, anytime...' '...is music and joy!' 'When comes about the night...' '...the scriptures take flight!' 'Present is a pretty girl and a catchy song.' 'Wherever it touches knows only joys, no sorrows.' I only told you to tell him "I love you." Why kiss him? With an "I love you", he'll be distracted only for a month. That kiss will distract him for the entire semester! Okay, come! 'An eye on an eye is always a plus!' 'No more will there anything minus!' 'Only the combination of two minus signs, results in an equation!' 'X & Y have been integrated together!' 'And they have been synced together!' 'Such linking and syncing is what is infatuation!' 'Even if your smile is nano-sized...' '...my heart will soar at the speed of a rocket!' 'Until both our data packs get exhausted, let's keep talking!' 'An eye on an eye is always a plus!' 'No more will there anything minus!' What is this? -Infatuation! We're both mature, yes? Keep going! 'Within this diagram of the DNA...' '...only your image, do I see.' 'Neutrons and electrons fill your eyes.' 'Neutralized, is my heart!' 'Centigrade disintegrates in the warmth of our kisses!' 'Fahrenheit meets ruin, through our fiery love!' 'Newton's law, you are!' I got this, aunty! Go on! -'My darling moon, you are!' 'If one falls towards the ground, it is gravitation!' 'If one falls towards a girl, it is infatuation!' 'Unable to understand further!' 'But, the heart does not falter!' 'All of Darwin's theories...' '...transpire one by one!' 'Do the greetings of hormones, arouse feelings within?' 'Does something come to surface, beyond that?' 'The first caress, a mystery!' 'The next, a response!' 'Calculation, adds numbers together!' 'Infatuation, amalgamates hormones together!' 'An eye on an eye is always a plus!' She's just a kid, grandma! -'No more will there anything minus!' 'Only the combination of two minus signs, results in an equation!' 'X & Y have been integrated together!' 'And they have been synced together!' 'Such linking and syncing is what is infatuation!' Why? What happened? Why are you all looking at us like that? If there's a fuse, swap bulbs. Not lips! This is common between guys and girls! How do you know this? Not just us! The whole city knows it! We've heard it so many times! Alright then. I have no time to discuss this! We have exams tomorrow! Come, Maha. Let's study! The bulb will go out again. Use this. Give me that, you bandicoot! What is this, man? This is what they call 'combined studies', mom! What a fine father! Get going! Hello, son-in-law! I've found a great alliance for your daughter. Yes, very much in accordance to your status! Alright. Come over. We'll discuss the rest then. If I'm first in class, I'll tell you something. If I come first, I'll tell you something, too! What did Mahalakshmi want to tell you? What the hell do women usually say? "Sorry, 'mama'! Goodbye, 'mama'!" What else? I'll kick the snot out of you! Who was the topper, bro? First, tell us that! If Balu came first, what did you wish to tell him, sis? Do I look good? What do you want to tell him? First, tell me how I look. Then, I'll tell you. You look amazing, sis! Is that so? Then, I'll tell you later! -Sis! You never give parties when your son tops the class. What has changed? Please wait a while. Groom's on the way. Soon as he's here, I'll tell you. What is this, Mahalakshmi? You didn't come first? 'Mama' certainly did! So Balu coming first is akin to you coming first? Very well... There's some kind of infatuation between them! Oh? Is that so? You came first after you joined forces with Maha to torpedo Ajay. Awesome, buddy. Congrats! What the hell, man? Can't you keep your mouth shut? Let it slide! What did I say wrong? Sis, Balu asked that you take a straw and come to the terrace! A straw, huh? Alright, I'll take one! Why get upset over this? Ups and downs are part of life! Don't get too sad and think of what to do next. Do you get what I'm saying? -Who's on the phone? How about that, 'mama'? Gave quite a shock, didn't I? Yes, he'd be definitely shocked! Said that a treat from me wouldn't be possible even if I sold my family fortune? See what he does now! Whatever the case, Ajay is great! Despite all our planning, he only scored 2% less than you! Good thing we planned well! If not, he may have even topped the class! So, you say our plan worked out well? So, if your words of love hadn't distracted him, he'd have topped the class, yes? Definitely, 'mama'! He's quite the bookworm! He's always reading something! However you look at it, Ajay's great, right? Yes. No doubt about it. He's totally great. What about me? Tell me. If Ajay's great, what am I? You're great too, 'mama'. A question can't have two answers, Mahalakshmi. Is Ajay great or am I great? You're the great one. What was that pause for? Only upon thinking, does it seem to you I'm great? Nothing like that! Did you say that to compel him? -Time to cut the cake, Balu! I'll get him, aunty! Everyone downstairs is happy. Let's go cut the cake! Why fight between ourselves now? Let's go! So you agree with me because I'm picking a fight, yes? So, Ajay is great, huh? So this is what you wanted to tell me if I came first? No, 'mama'! Hold on! Please don't talk to me! I have no joy in being topper! It's as if someone threw alms to me! Where were you all this time? Cut the cake and get this party going! No party or anything! Ask everyone to leave! What do I look like to you? You call Ajay great! How can he ever be great? How could you think such a thing? Listen up! How can a guy who gets disturbed, ever be great? If one loves studying, nothing would ever distract them! Didn't you disturb me in the name of infatuation? Was I distracted? Did I distract you, 'mama'? Yes! Didn't you distract me like you did with Ajay? And, both are the same, is it? Yes, it is! If they're the same, I'll tell you right now! Ajay is greater than you! Get out of here! You eat in our house, but praise him? What? What did you just say? I said that you eat in our house but praise him! What are you saying, Balu? What happened to you? Look at her, dad! After getting her out of some village, letting her stay here, feeding her... ...and helping her study, she calls someone else great! Ajay's great, huh? Who fed whom? If it wasn't for my dad's help, uncle couldn't have set up his business! Understand that! He's just ranting about. Don't join him! What is all of this, man? In such a joyous time, why fight like so? Be quiet, dear boy! Hear what she's saying, mom? They gave us all of this, huh? All we have is alms they gave us, she says! If my dad hadn't pitied you and gotten you out of that dump... ...you'd still be patting dung there! Least I would've just been patting dung! You would've ripped your clothes, stared at the sky... ...and streaked across the streets screaming 'first rank'! Yes! I can't survive without being topper! But, remember this! If not for us, your family can't survive! What the hell, man? -True! You gave me a place to stay, study and eat! If not for your family, we couldn't have survived! Thank you very much for that! But, here's the thing! I'll find a job and settle our debt! With interest, too! Will that suffice? Who the hell will give you a job? Maybe once I start a company, ask me for a job! I'll be kind enough to oblige. -Stop it! Work with it. Now go! That's alright! Let me know if you have problems running your company! I'll come and help! I'll make you say "That is Mahalakshmi"! Get lost! Dad! Talk to him, mom! -What is this, man? Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. I'm here for you. -No need, dad! Welcome, son-in-law. Just arrived? Why stand here? Come in. -No, dad! Let's leave. Brother-in-law! Get me out of here, dad! -Come in! Small tussle between kids. We'll talk! -No, Subbu. We'll talk later. Come, dear. Hold on! Tell me the computer password and go! "Balu Mama." All aunties, please leave! We need to speak to her alone! Hello sis! How are you all studying? Why do you ask Balu-type questions? Close your eyes, sis! Why? I've stopped eating chicken. What? You've stopped eating chicken? Yes, I have. What happened, sis? Did Balu say anything to you? Tell me, sis! Nowadays, I work out at the gym. I'll rip him to shreds! What happened, sis? Tell us! You all know that Balu and I got into a fight, right? After that, we stopped talking. A few days later, I got a phone call. I learnt that grandma was in a critical condition. How is she, doctor? Who are you? -She is my grandmother, too. Ask him. Uncle... How is grandma, uncle? Oh wow! Is this the same Mahalakshmi? What's up? When did you get here? How are you? Tell me how grandma's doing, uncle. Oh, throw that old crow in the trash! You said you'd pay us back with interest! Do you have it with you now? How come you have no suitcase? Intend to pay us by cheque? Please, uncle. How is she? What do I say, dear? I brought you here to study, so you wouldn't struggle in your village. But, you said you'll pay everything back with interest and left. Do you know something, Maha? You were only a baby when your mom died. Your aunt was the one who nursed and raised you. Are you looking to settle that debt, too? Tell me, Mahalakshmi. Please forgive me, uncle! Your grandma is fine. Nothing's wrong with her. With your tears, you've paid up the interest. Okay? Now smile! Now you've paid the principal, too! Come, let's go see grandma. Have change for 2,000 rupees? Have change for 2,000 rupees, sir? Have change for 2,000 bucks, bro? Nephew? When did you come, uncle? Didn't see you. Sure, I believe you. How much change do you want? -A hundred rupees. Here. First go and pay it up. Here you go, uncle. It's alright, dear boy. We'll adjust it when we settle our account. Go on. -I'm sorry, uncle. Don't know how, but she just fainted after the cake cutting. I've gotten the report. -After that, I... What is it, son? Paid the fee? -Yes. Want to me to buy a coffee or something for you? We've already had some. You and Mahalakshmi go have some. Alright? And then... Heads. So you must talk first. But, you already spoke first. You never gave me that chance. How are you? So far, not so good. Recession period, right? I lost my job because of it. Confident about the job, I bought a flat. As I lost my job, couldn't pay the EMI. After that, we had to sell the land we had in the village. Right now, even dad stays with me. Overall, the situation is pretty bad. Why are you looking at me like that? Only if I say such things, you will be glad, right? Now you make me happy. Last year, I started a company. Didn't go well at all! 100 crore rupees lost! Never mind saving money, I have none to even shave my beard! This is the last shirt I have. After this, I need to borrow from Kumar! Grandma's unwell... -That's enough. I became very happy. How childish we were! When I slept, you studied! Know how I jealous I was when you topped the class? I'd tear your books apart! You'd study your books by hiding them in film magazines! I challenged you that you'd be forced to say "That is Mahalakshmi!" I said that I'd get you a job in my company! Thinking about all of these used to make me laugh hard! Okay, Mahalakshmi. Now tell me the truth. What are you doing now? I'm working at Infosys. With a salary of 1.5 lakh rupees. I've bought at flat at East Coast Road. What have you been up to? To tell you the truth, you know that I can't live without being number one. Last year, I started a company. 'Cloud Technologies'. We have a little over hundred employees. Annual turnover is 40 crore rupees. I'm about to open another branch, too. How much did you say your salary was? The lowest pay I give my employees is two lakh rupees. If you ever want a job, call me. I'll set you up with a great job. Don't worry. So I must plead with you if I want a job, right? Only then will you give me. I didn't mean it like that! Why are you talking like this? I'm not the man I was. I've changed a lot! How do I prove it to you? Ajay is great! Is that alright? I agree that Ajay is great. What is this? I admit that Ajay is great and you still won't say that I'm great! When you first started talking, I thought you had matured a bit. But, not even a little bit... I knew that you weren't mature enough to talk to me! That's why I broke the ice! You haven't changed at all! You haven't changed either, Mahalakshmi. Get the luggage from the car! -Yes, sir! Welcome, uncle! Are you well? I am well. Who the hell is this guy? How can he take the luggage without my permission? His name is Appu, uncle. Since his youth, he has stayed with us as domestic help. I'm a member of this family, too! -Family member, eh? Don't say that! If you're a family member, then what am I? Just say 'family employee'! Uncle! You... Your Benz car was black, right? You've come in a white one. -It is a black Benz! The Indian climate mustn't ruin it. So, I painted it white! Could've just bought a white one instead! A black car can be painted white! How do you paint a white car white? No... -My sister didn't raise you well! Thought you forgetfully took another person's car! Me? Forgetful? You're talking like a child, Kumar! Good grief! My name isn't Kumar, uncle! It's Subbu! -Don't I know that? When you were a kid, I used to lovingly call you 'Kumar baby'! Ask your mom about it! Listen up! I'm Robert Ramaiah! 2 GB RAM! 20 GB memory! Even if Google forgets, Robert Ramaiah will not! My strength is my memory! Let's go! Is that so, uncle? Brother-in-law! My uncle from America! He is Jayanthi's... I know! Jayanthi's husband, yes? I handed him the nuptial thread! You didn't come to their wedding! Also, after your child was born, I wanted to call you. As I didn't have your number, I couldn't. Please give it to me. Oh man! Storing Indian phone numbers are a pain! If you don't mind, please save it for me. Dear nephew! -What is it, uncle? Maybe he can't see. My eyes are fine. Please save your phone number. Nephew... -Yes, uncle? Maybe he's illiterate. I know how to read and write! Please store it for me! Nephew? -Yes, uncle? When did you renovate the house? -Six months ago. What's wrong? For six months, it looks very old! In America, we shift houses every month! Have you saved it? Give me that. 'Krishna'. Still those archaic names! Much like your look, you haven't changed your name! Got a taste of my uncle's memory power? Even if Google forgets, I will not! If you have so much memory, you'd remember me! Of course, I'd remember! You are... Tell me! -You are... Krishna's son, right? No, uncle! He's my son! If he's your son, he's Krishna's son-in-law! No one understands that! Think hard, kiddo! In your childhood, you'd keep playing with my beard! While going to school, you'd hold my finger and tag along! When you were just an infant, he went to America! Only now, did he return! I wanted to connect with you on WhatsApp and chat with you. As I didn't have your number, I couldn't. Save it on my phone. My number, right? Sure, I'll save it for you. Oh, man! Please hurry. Change your expression, man! Faster, kiddo! Like a cricket umpire, he keeps staring at me! You save the numbers correctly, but just forget to call! I didn't forget, Surya! I was just busy! Who is Surya, uncle? Oh! Busted, am I? Actor Surya from 'Singam' films! Forgotten your son's name, have you? My name isn't Surya. It's Balu. To test your 2 GB RAM and 20 GB memory, I saved my number in another name. I flew down here after learning that my sister was unwell! Why do the silly kids mess with me like so? Look that way! His glances freak the hell out of me! Heard you have a heart problem, sis! What happened? Why you little... Only if I'm ill and bed-ridden will you remember me? Don't talk to me about memory, sis! I have all numbers stored here! But, I have your number in here! No, in here! I owe my name, frame and life to my parents. But, the one who sent me abroad, made me study, bought me a car... ...and brought me social status was you! Will I ever forget that? Bhavani? -I'm not Bhavani. My name is Aruna. Okay, Aruna. Could you get some coffee with sugar? Please and thanks. -Be right back! In our family, everyone's heart is strong, sis! But, I can't believe that you have heart problems! Whatever you can't share on social media, you can share with me. I must look into it, rectify it and cure you! I must return my gratitude! Hence why I returned from America. Tell me! What has affected my sister is no ordinary heart attack. Even doctors in America or London cannot cure it! Uncle! We normally can't understand you. Now, you're speaking incoherently! Please tell us very clearly what you want to say. What do I say? My sister's wishing for a marriage! -What? It's not what you think! My sister's last wish is to see Balu and Maha get married. What do you say? What do we have to say about this? If the kids are okay with it, so are we! If Balu's okay with it... Sorry, uncle. I already have a girlfriend. I'm going to marry her. What he said might give me a heart attack! -What are you saying? Who knows how my sister would react to this? Mom, this is Swapna. Yeah, go with that! How come you never told me about this? I already told you her name! Then, I don't need your number. Who is she, Balu? I told you I wouldn't introduce one person in this house, right? She is that person. Tsk-ing like a horse is all you can do. He's got a chick that's as pretty as a pony! Balu's got excellent taste, yes? Balu's got excellent taste. But, she has horrible taste! Balu's quite the short tempered guy. How'd you hook up with him? Oh no, uncle! He's nothing like that! As far as I'm concerned, Balu is great! That word would've mesmerized him! Now watch how I extract the truth from her. Alright, Apna... I mean, Swapna... I'll ask you some questions on your personality. You must answer them bravely. Okay? Your height... -5 foot 7 inches. And that means? She's two inches taller than me. And your salary? -Two lakh rupees! How much for you? 50,000 rupees more than me. With regards to personality... Saw how I nailed him? Failed in one subject! Just passed in two! A real dunce! Who is a dunce? Her or you? You've just embarrassed America! Phone number, huh? Still four digits short! It's not a phone number, but the measurements of Miss India. Measurements, huh? He would've exaggerated, anyway. How about yours? Dad! Quickly find a groom for me. Smarter, cuter and more stylish than Balu! Overall, he must be more than the best of Balu! What are you trying to say? That Balu is stylish, cute and intelligent... ...and overall, Balu is the best. Am I right? What a lovely girl. It appears one can live here without a ration card or Aadhar card. But, not without a boyfriend, eh? Uncle, if Balu can have a partner can I not have one, too? Why must we wait so long for a 'pannadhi' (beggar)? "Pannadhi"? Is that his name? Lovely name. "Pannadhi". Is he a Korean? I don't believe that anyone could ever fall in love with Mahalakshmi! Hey, Ajay! What problem would the car have, dear? A Benz car, no less! No, uncle. Just that Ajay's height is 6'1''. His head bumps on to the roof! 6'1''? Are the military looking to enlist him? It means he's two inches taller than you, Balu! Does your head not bump onto your car, dear boy? What are you asking, uncle? For this very problem, he's bought three specially designed Audi cars! Three cars, huh? That means he has two cars more than you! Do you have a call taxi company, Ajay? What's that, uncle? A call taxi company? He owns an IT company! With an annual turnover of 100 crores! 100 crores, huh? That's double that of Balu! So Balu? Why talk about all this now, Mahalakshmi? You know I don't like this, yes? See that, uncle? He doesn't like it when anyone praises him! Because of that, in my opinion, Ajay is great. Always. Are you blind? There was no collision! Why hit me? Thankfully, the car is okay. -Drive carefully! How do you know that the car is okay? Maha, this isn't a car. It's my life. My heart will stop if anything happens to it! Tell me, Balu. Approve that SIM card company project! This year, our turnover must cross 100 crores! That's really hard, buddy. For we need to buy new systems and hire more staff. It's a really big process. The smallest slip can lead to loss! What if it succeeds? That's not it, buddy. Very risky. Why? Despite you knowing nothing, I've kept you on as a partner. Is this a bigger risk than that? Are those two the same, buddy? Very well then. Do what I say, man! Awesome twist, sis! You nailed Ajay's entrance! Balu must have been shocked! During that time, you must have called us! We'd have ridiculed Balu to make him mad further! Yes, sis! Then, how did the engagement happen? 'Like a piece of paper that flutters in the air...' '...why did you move away from me, O dear girl?' 'Mistaking a mirage to be an image of true love...' '...I sought it out, but it was for all naught!' 'Like a piece of paper that flutters in the air...' '...why did you move away from me, O dear girl?' 'Mistaking a mirage to be an image of true love...' '...I sought it out, but it was for all naught!' 'Two eyes are not sufficient!' 'A million eyes, I have not to cry!' 'Eyelids, far from the eyes! Memories, far from the heart!' 'And life? Far from the body!' 'Fall to the ground, did one flower of a pair in a plant!' 'Despite this fall, can they ever unite again?' 'The moments I lived with you...' '...lie shattered like glass!' 'All the memories we made together...' '...flashed before my eyes, one by one!' 'If we get everything we sought...' '...realize this pain, the heart will not!' 'If we enjoy anything we receive...' '...cry not, will a single eye!' 'Is my anger, my love? Is your silence, your love?' 'We go about without realizing that!' 'One word of a mine, should suffice. As will one word of yours, in response.' 'All will turn upside down! Speak, my girl.' 'Like a piece of paper that flutters in the air...' '...why did you move away from me, O dear girl?' 'Mistaking a mirage to be an image of true love...' '...I sought it out, but it was for all naught!' 'Two eyes are not sufficient!' 'A million eyes, I have not to cry!' 'Eyelids, far from the eyes! Memories, far from the heart!' 'And life? Far from the body!' 'Fall to the ground, did one flower of a pair in a plant!' 'Despite this fall, can they ever unite again?' In this invitation... ...I wished for Balu and Maha's names... ...to be together. The fact that it ended up just a dream... ...was something I never expected. Some dreams are like that, mom. They remain just that. Dreams. You wanted to be together with dad, too. That... didn't happen, either. This is just like that, mom. This is the first auspicious event in our family. It must not happen without your grandpa's presence. This first invitation... ...must be given to him. Could you to tell him I want him there? I'm not in a position to do it myself. Tell your grandpa that's why I couldn't come. No matter what... ...don't tell him that I'm in a critical condition! Mop! Put that luggage in my car! Keep it in my car, Mop! Laugh it out, Mop! -Why? The thought of travelling 500 kilometres by auto-rickshaw. That's why! Tell him not to comment about my car! The two of you seem like an angry couple after marriage! What is your problem, now? About which car to use, yes? I have a technique in America. What's it called? The 'RRT'! Robert Ramaiah Technique! Please come and put your key here! Hey, Maha! Come and do the same! Now, I'll shuffle them! And that will solve your problem! Keep it in there! -Sure thing! What's wrong with him? Let's go! You moron! Let's move! -Hey, family employee! Why keep the luggage in my car? Per the Robert Ramaiah technique, your car was selected! The doctor who sought to treat a patient, has become a patient himself! Ask her to drive, Mop! I won't drive! I can't drive either, bro! Why fight over this, you two? He's idling by! Let him drive! -"Idling by?" I'm not a driver! I'm the owner of this Benz car! Owner, right? Then drive! -I don't know how! Then why buy a car? -Was a desire. For status. What? -Thank goodness you didn't get married! I'll skewer you later! I won't agree to that! -Crap! If you fight like this before leaving, won't my car get into an accident? What is the problem, now? All because the two of you know each other, right? Put that aside! From this moment on, the two of you are new flowers from different gardens! Your name isn't Balu. It's Sharukh. Sharukh Khan! Why are you laughing? Don't like my idea? The idea is fine. But the fact that you called him Sharukh made me laugh! From this moment, your name isn't Maha. It's Kajol! Why are you laughing? Just that it's hard to see her as 'Kajol'. Thought you wouldn't fight if I changed your names... ...but you fight when I change them! You drive for the first 3 hours! You drive for the next 3 hours! Please take good care of my car! How is the car, Balu? What about it? It's fine. Had a feeling of an organ being ripped and flung out of my body! Is that so? -Yes. Tell Maha that I said 'hi'! Turn on the radio if you guys get bored. Your journey will be fun! That's what we're listening to. The sound is epic! It's epic? I can't hear anything! It's shivering, here! Since you're pretty far off, that's why you can't hear it. What's in the car isn't an engine, but my heart! The notion of pressing the accelerator too hard might hurt the car... ...was why I never learnt to drive! Take care, kiddo. Be safe. Fine, I'll take care. -Happy journey! To my car! Who do you think you're messing with? Hey, stop the car! -Why? Must I tell you everything? I'll take a leak and be right back. Why did you keep driving? Are you going to stop the car or not? She's increasing the air-conditioning, too! This guy is torturing me, too! It's me, Balu! All smooth? Think it'll flow smoothly, but she just won't let me! Careful. In your squabble, the car might take a hit! The flowing fuel will be useless! Nothing of that sort! But, she's going without letting my stuff flow! Hang up! Am I disturbing him too much? I tossed away the bottle, too! You witch! Want me to pull over? Say "That is Mahalakshmi" and I'll do it. You needn't pull over. I know how to make you do it. Don't! What are you doing? Don't you have any sense? -Go get it! I can't hold it in! Run! Run! Run! No one is around to see this! Hey, Sharukh! -Yes, tell me! You're living the character! Great! How is the journey? -All fine. But, the legs really hurt. The legs hurt? How can that be if you're going by car? Or did you press the accelerator so hard that it hurt your leg? I don't get it, Sharukh. To make it clearer for you, you're must do something right away. Tell me! I'll do it immediately! Quickly take a call taxi and go to a nearby hospital! What happened to Kajol? Tell me, Sharukh! I'm fine! But, you go to the hospital. And hurry! Why? Tell me clearly! -I just told you to go! Hurry! Go to the hospital right away! -Taxi! I've reached the hospital! Now tell me what to do! I'll tell you. Don't get agitated! Locate the emergency ward and go in there! The emergency ward? Where is that thing? Hurry up! Faster! I'm moving faster than an ambulance, Kajol! It's over there! Emergency! This is the room! I've reached the emergency ward! Is there an empty bed over there? -Yes! Sit down on it! Why is he telling me to sit on a patient's bed? Okay, I've sat on it! Quickly call the doctor! I called for a doctor thrice, and three of you show up? Doctors are here! Must I call nurses? There's no need for that. I'm going to tell you two important things. Go ahead. -First is for you. Second is for doctors. Tell me everything, dear boy! And I'll intimate the doctors! Just that if I tell you the first thing, you won't be able to hear the second. Tell me the second, first! Put the phone on speaker. -Speaker? You're on speaker! My uncle's about to have a heart attack! Take good care of him. He is very important to us! He seems fine, sir! -Hey! Don't get started. The kid always jokes around with me! Tell me the first thing quickly, dear boy! Your car... ...has been wrecked! Can you do a small favor for me, Sharukh? Yes, tell me. Pretend to be Balu in grandpa's presence. Can you do it? Is that all? Kajol, I need a favor from you, as well. What? I must pretend to be Mahalakshmi before grandpa, am I right? I built roads for this town! I built schools for this town! I built hospitals, too! Forgetting all that, you claim that some schmuck named Ambani is great? Grandpa! -No, sir. You are the great one! You admit it because I hit you? Why start a fight over this? I admitted it, right? So you admit it because I fought you, right? Same genes! Listen up! I won't pay a single penny for this year's festival! Get your funding from that great Ambani chap! What? -Hold on, sir. Every year, you put out a great festival! How can you drop such a bombshell? You're the oldest person in this town. No, in this district! How can you say this? -What? "Oldest"? Telling me I've aged? 'Cause my moustache is greyed? Nothing like that, sir. Let it go. I've even asked the dancers to come by auto! Why by auto? Could've arranged ten lorries! Now who are you going to call 'great'? Grandkids are here! -Whose grandkids? The son of your son and daughter of your daughter. Let's go! Grandpa! -Why is he leaving angrily? Hold on, grandpa! -He does everything well. This anger... -Grandpa! Open the door, grandpa! Come on out, grandpa! Please! Please listen to what we have to say, for just a minute! Talk to us, grandpa! I have no relatives. I know no one! Please leave! Tell them to leave! My name is Balu Mahendra, grandpa. Same as yours! Yes, grandpa. My name is Mahalakshmi, too! Grandma's name! Be quiet! So? That old lady wants to know if I'm alive or dead, right? Ask them to leave, Muruga! No, grandpa! We're both getting married! She asked us to give you the first invitation! Yes! As it is the first auspicious event of our household... ...grandma sent us over to give you the first invitation! That's why we're here, grandpa! What? The two of you are getting married? -Yes! My darlings! My grandkids are getting married! Come along! What is this, dear girl? Why is your face so glum? It is very good news. Let everyone hear it. Read! "A wedding invite from the home of Mr. Balu and Ms. Mahalakshmi." What is this? Your dad named you after me! Dad didn't name me, grandpa. Grandma did! Terrific. Keep reading. "In the upcoming auspicious year of 'Hevilambi'..." "...on the 10th day of the 'Thai' month, a Friday..." "...from 7:30 AM to 9:00 AM..." "...my son Subramaniam's only son..." "...the honorable groom Mr. Balu Mahendra..." "...and the honorable bride Ms..." "The honorable bride, Ms..." Give me that. "...and the honorable bride Ms. Mahalakshmi..." "...are set to be united by the bounds of holy matrimony." Did you hear what Balu just read, grandpa? I couldn't hear it clearly. Did all of you hear it? Yes, sir. We heard it. Did you hear it? -We heard what you said, sir. But, we didn't hear what the boy said! -I figured! Dear boy, why swallow most of the words? Let the entire town hear this great news. Read it aloud! "...and the honorable bride, Ms. Mahalakshmi..." "...will be united by the bonds of holy matrimony." The donation, sir... Why bother roaming about town for this anymore? Here! Hold on a second! Give this with your hands, Balu. For the temple festival. Thank you, dear boy. Listen up! This year's festival must be more special than anything we had before! 'Strange things are occurring in this town!' 'There is no one here to listen to these tales!' 'Listen to the story of Kamatchi! Lend me your ears!' Hit it! Hit it, I said! 'A gem encrusted nose ring and a two layered necklace...' '...he bought from a moneylender just for me!' 'A five rupee colored dot vase and a ten rupee powder case...' '...he bought lovingly, just for me!' 'Glass bangles and shiny anklets for my feet...' '...shrewdly he bought, only for me!' 'For a mere ten lakh rupees...' '...sold me off to a toothless old man, did my husband!' 'Should you give me your 'mama' just for one night...' '...my thirst will be quenched!' 'Should we engage in such a dainty relationship...' '...my mood will be restored! Will you give him to me?' 'I won't give up my 'mama' to anyone!' 'So shut up and get lost!' 'Men are plenty in this town!' 'Go look for them in every home!' 'As it turns out, the next story...' '...is that of every man who married a pretty woman.' 'A story of one who always suspects his wife of infidelity!' 'Here is Sevvandhi, who is caught in such a tussle!' Come on! Come out and tell them, dear! 'Hearing the mere sound of my anklets...' '...causes him to suspect my movements!' 'Hearing the mere sound of my bangles...' '...makes him ask which other man I'm looking to trap!' 'Should a mosquito come and bite me...' '...he asks which man performed this lecherous act!' 'Even if a man smiles at me on the road...' '...my husband asks if I'm sleeping with him, too!' 'Give me your 'mama!', dear!' 'I'll have my fun with him and return him to you!' 'Get away from here as fast as you can!' 'For I was born for him!' 'The husbands whose wives work abroad...' 'Do you know what they do in town?' What happened, Sharukh? It's Balu's problem. Doesn't concern us. 'For a hefty salary, he sent me over to Dubai!' 'To buy a television and refrigerator, sent over money, I did!' 'Bought him the bed and sofa set that he asked for!' 'Asked for a house in East Coast Road, he did! Bought him that, too!' 'Came down to settle down with my dearest husband!' 'Atop the bed I bought for him, was another woman!' 'Do not give your 'mama' to anyone!' 'Do not end up as a fool, like I did!' 'I will not give my 'mama' to anyone!' 'I will not even let the scent of another woman near him!' What is she doing? What is this? Is this really necessary for her? She's pretty enough as it is! She's putting a sack load of powder on her face! I can't watch this, dear boy! Fast forward! Keep fast-forwarding! Everyone is together. How about that? A birthday party at her age? Cake is a bit much, don't you think? Like a doll in a jewelry store! Mom! -Grandma! What happened, mom? What is this? What happened to her? Did you take her to a hospital? -She's fine. Don't worry. Is she alright? -Yes, she's fine. What button must I press to see her again? This button. How is she... Why all this? Why must I go there? Why must I come there? Tell me why I must come there. I do not have the willpower to see her like this. I can't do it. Must I travel so far to see her in that state? Grandpa... Look. Look, dear. Mahalakshmi. Just like the goddess. But, now? No need. I'll stay back here with these memories to keep me company. I won't come. I'll make do with these memories. That's good enough for me. What? Want to know what button to press to watch this again, right? No... Kumar here. -I'll stay behind with these memories... The call's for you. -Who is it? I won't come. -Tell me. Everyone's waiting for you here, Balu. If you hurry, we can start the meeting. How many times must I tell you? Grandma... -Do you understand me? No need for a meeting! Close everything. I can't come over there right now! How are you? -I'm fine. How many times... -How was your trip? How is your grandfather? He's doing very well. I don't want anything. Just shut it all down and leave. That's why I got a special gift for you. Without even seeing it, you say it's nice? No, dad. I can't stand the pressure. You often say that one thing, right? Say it now. What? -That thing you often say. Say what? -That thing! I'm fine, uncle. Your father. Alright, Maha. Honestly speaking, do you like this? Tell me, dad. -When do we go shopping? What happened to Balu, uncle? Balu had signed a deal with a cell phone company. For that project, he tirelessly worked on developing a software. And that Prakash, you know, his business partner... ...sold it to another cell phone company, without Balu's knowledge. The original cell phone company's considering filing a case against Balu. If an explanation isn't given in fifteen days... ...they said he will have to pay a penalty. Don't know if we can raise the money for the penalty fee... ...even if we sell our entire property. That's why Balu is at a loss for what he can do. What are you all doing? Working on 'regaining' our application work. Who told you to do this? The new programming manager told us to do so. Come on in. We've been waiting for you. We have fifteen days. We can develop an advanced version of the tech that Prakash stole. Guide us. We're all ready to work together. If we work hard, we can develop a new project... ...that'll shock that cell phone company! What are you thinking? There's no time to think! Only if we work day and night, can we finish this project. Who asked you to come here? I just came by to help you... I don't need anyone's help. Get out. Mahalakshmi speaking. You said I could call you anytime I needed a job, right? I need a job right now. If you have no job to give, tell me. I'll leave. What are you thinking about? Do you have a job to spare or not? Alright, come on in. 'You stood all over my heart.' 'You won over all my memories.' 'Leaving me behind, you walked away.' 'Vanishing not, you appeared before my eyes.' 'Within my eyes, you stayed.' 'Like a dream, you faded away.' 'Even if lost, the sky will not be gone.' 'In the same vein, our love will never change!' 'Even if you leave my side, our bond shall never break.' 'Even if I die, our love shall never change.' 'No matter what the heart says, it will not forget you.' 'Wounds may heal, but scars remain forever.' When did you get here, Ajay? You didn't call. More like you didn't answer. I was tied at work. Just wait. I'll go freshen up. Do you know what the time is now? It's 3:30 AM. With our wedding in two days, you coming this late is not nice at all. I can understand this. But, my parents won't take it lying down. So it's better if you don't go to office from tomorrow. When is our wedding, Ajay? Tell me when it is. This Friday at 9:30. Which means that until 9:29 AM on Friday, I belong to this house. After 9:30, you can ask me any question you desire. I'll answer you. My family is in a tough spot right now. At this juncture, I have to support them. It's alright if your parents cannot comprehend this. You must explain it to them. 'Bonds that arise from friendship, end when partners separate.' 'Bonds that come from family, end not even when partners separate.' 'Nothing can change that relationship!' 'Only upon falling into a pit, will you know its depth, my dear!' 'Only when a heart breaks, will you know the depth of its misery!' 'You stood all over my heart.' 'You won over all my memories.' 'Leaving me behind, you walked away.' 'Vanishing not, you appeared before my eyes.' 'Within my eyes, you stayed.' 'Like a dream, you faded away.' 'Even if lost, the sky will not be gone.' 'In the same vein, our love will never change!' 'Even if you leave my side, our bond shall never break.' 'Even if I die, our love shall never change.' 'No matter what the heart says, it will not forget you.' 'Wounds may heal, but scars remain forever.' It's almost done. Dig in. Today is Saturday. Now eat. Remember I told you that if I came first I'd tell you something? If this project is successful, I'll tell you. We got it! Before we booze, I wanted to address you all. Because if I speak after boozing, you'd think I was blubbering! I lost. Yes, I lost. I never wanted to seek Mahalakshmi's help in my life. But, if she has helped me, it means I've lost, right? If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be celebrating this! That's why I'm saying that I lost. For the first time, I'm glad that I lost. As only because I lost, did I win today. In college, I told Mahalakshmi that I'd tell her something if I came first. Until now, I haven't told her that. In this happy occasion, I wish to tell her that before all of you. Awesome, sis! Just as you promised... ...you made Balu say "That is Mahalakshmi!" So, you're the winner! Yes, sis! You're the winner! You're here, huh? You left halfway! Did you hear what I said? That's what you wanted me to say, right? Did it startle you when I said that? I knew it would shock you! You're happy now, right? Yes, I'm happy. I'm really really happy! With this project, my company made a profit of more than 80 crore rupees! What is 80 crores, anyway? In six months, you'll topple Ajay's company. I need to overtake Ajay's company. That means I haven't surpassed Ajay's company, right? Not at all... -Ajay's company is very huge! My company is really small, am I right? In your eyes, Ajay is always great. But I'm not, right? I didn't mean to say that. I'm nothing to you, right? Not even this level of great to you, am I? Remember how you looked at me when you first came from your village? With a look of surprise. I seemed spectacular in your eyes, yes? I was like the sky for you, right? I always wanted to see those feelings in your eyes. I always wanted to appear great to you. You know why I stopped you when you wanted to leave after failing? Because, I didn't want to lose you. To my misfortune, Ajay became the topper. So that only I would seem great to you again. To see that surprised look in your eyes again. But, what did you say? "Ajay is great!" All was lost! Everything was lost! It really hurts. Wonder why it hurts me if you call someone else great? I seem like a jealous oaf to you, right? I seem like a lunatic, right? Because, I wanted the girl who loved me to only think of me as great. Yes, Mahalakshmi. I love you. You are my heart. My life! I like you so very much, Mahalakshmi. My aunt's daughter, right? Thought you wouldn't go anywhere. But... you left. I waited for you for three years. Know what I thought when you came to the hospital that day? Why our grandma didn't have a heart attack earlier! When uncle Rami asked about our wedding... ...fearing that you'd reject me, I lied about having a girlfriend. That's why I brought Swapna home. Do you know who Swapna is? She is my personal assistant! Thought you'd get jealous if I brought Swapna home. But lo and behold, came the one named Ajay! After making you say that I was great... ...I wanted to tell you that I loved you. But every time, I keep losing! I'm not great, Mahalakshmi. I'm just plain Balu. That's all. You are my success and my failure. You are my everything! If not for you, I am not me. Now, you're no longer for me. I love you! No need, Mahalakshmi. Like buying someone's first rank for me, don't give up your love for my sake. There you have it! My great love failure story! What is this? She's been madly in love with you! Yes! Yes, indeed! Is that how you all felt? -Yes! That's how we felt! -It's nothing like that! Mahalakshmi never loved me. As I told the story from my perspective, I embellished certain nuggets. That's all it was! Nothing else! If Mahalakshmi didn't love you, why did she have to tell you that she did? Fair question, bro! At least in the end, you asked the right question. She said it because I told her I loved her! What if I didn't tell her I loved her? That's it! All is lost! If she didn't love you, why would she help out at your company? It is a family company, boss! True. She helped because she didn't want her family's company to suffer. Isn't that right, bro? -Indeed! Now tell me, boss! Would you believe Mahalakshmi when she says that she loves me? Doesn't seem believable... -Seem drunk and confused... I've put my ego aside and told you my entire story! And you won't believe me, huh? I swear, boss! I was the one who sincerely loved her. She didn't love me at all! Believe me! We believe you, bro! I won't believe you! Someone won't believe me! Who's there? Who is that? -Some old man... Grandpa? -Grandpa? Grandpa! Quiet! -Hey, Quiet! Grandpa! Welcome, dad! -Hello, uncle! What is this? -Have a seat. What is going on here? -The wedding of Balu and Mahalakshmi, dad. The wedding is not between them! One wedding for him and another for her! I never wanted to come here! You deceived me by deliberately misreading the wedding invitation! Only upon coming here did I know the truth! They didn't deceive me. They've been deceiving each other! Dad, I... -Hey! Don't you know that Balu and Mahalakshmi love each other? They don't even have time to quarrel, dad! Do you love Mahalakshmi or not? Balu does love her. But, Mahalakshmi doesn't love him. Do you love Balu or not? He's lying! I've told him so many times! He doesn't believe in my love, grandpa! She says she loves you, right? So what's the problem? She'll say that if you ask her before everyone! You don't have to throw alms of love to me. Ajay is great. Go marry him! Who is Ajay? -See how he talks, grandpa? If I call Sachin Tendulkar great, does it mean that I love him? See that? Now she compares Ajay to Tendulkar! That means he plays well and I'm a street player, yes? Stop pissing me off! I'm getting very angry! Yes! All you will ever feel for me is anger! Because you didn't love me, right? Just infatuation! Infatuation, huh? What is this? -Let go, grandpa! What I had for you is just infatuation, eh? How can you claim that my love is that? Do you know the depth of my feelings? Your one caress made my life entire shiver. Even now, I want to hug you tightly! It's so hard to stand so apart from you! What the hell, man! How else can a girl give up her inhibition and admit that she loves you? Can't you even understand that? Fool! Is that so? Then have her answer this! If she loved me, why did she have to love Ajay, too? Have her answer that! Tell me! Think I loved Ajay? -Yes! For three years, Ajay proposed to me! But, I didn't accept it at all. Only after you brought Swapna, did I accept his proposal. Good grief! Don't believe her, grandpa! She's like grandma! Even if you agree to it, I won't agree to our marriage! Is that so? Very well! Get Swapna out here! Swapna, let's get married! What is this, dear? Getting violent before everyone? Not nice. Watching you two reminds me of the mistake made by your grandma and me 30 years ago! This stubbornness. This is what made us to part ways! And now, you two... Please take us as an example, throw away the ego from your hearts... ...and be happy. Alright, grandpa. I'll do as you say. Under one condition. -What is that? Just once, let her say that Ajay isn't great, but I am. No, grandpa. I can't say that. If my love is true only if I say that Balu is great... ...all my years of loving him will be meaningless! Back in my hometown, you said he was great! That was my dear Kajol, grandpa! I meant that my lover Sharukh was great, grandpa. Good grief! Who is this Sharukh and Kajol? I am the great creator of these characters. Robert Ramaiah! Turn this way, my boy. Yes, uncle? What is this? Slapping me as if I were a schoolboy? Why not? As if these characters weren't enough, you create new ones? Why? Are my creations causing any problems? They're not causing any problems. They've given a solution to the problem. Even if my car is gone, my concept worked out! This guy's glaring at me, too! Not letting me bask in joy! Do you like Kajol? I like her a lot, grandpa! Kajol has neither a flashback... ...nor an Ajay! Do you really like Sharukh? I like him very much! He will do anything for me! He'll even give his life for me! What are you waiting for? Change that name board at the entrance! Grandpa! She looks just like Mahalakshmi! Who are you? I'm Sharukh, grandpa! If you're Sharukh, she's Kajol, right? Tie the nuptial thread! What? -I'm not Kajol. I'm Mahalakshmi! Grandpa! -What? She's Mahalakshmi! Deceived me, didn't you? Be well! I'll take two! You're diabetic, right? Don't take it! What a silly guy you are! Take some! -Eat. A walk tomorrow should make it fine. Take some, baby doll! Take some, 'Look-Man'! What is this for? For their wedding? No! I've bought a new white colored Benz car! For your honeymoon! Enjoy! -Thanks! Not again!
