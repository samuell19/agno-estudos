It's fine, Allison. Dad, didn't What? hear something about one of your old cases? What? told you about the Andover cold case, didn't What?? No. Certainly told the rest of the world. What? could've sworn What? did. I'm getting old, Jimmy. Get this - Will finally got a confession. You want to guess who did it? The guy you thought did it? Damn right. Richard Paul. Just like What? always said. That's great. Makes me wish What? hadn't retired. You did more than your fair share of good, Dad. That job was going to give you a heart attack. Time to enjoy life. This is very nice, Allison. Thank you, Claire. The chickens not as dry as you usually make it. Come on, Mom! What? noticed the china could use a good polish. I'll come over this week to do it. No, you do not have to do that. It was my wedding gift to you. What? want it taken care of so that you can pass it down to Sydney. What? don't mind. CLEARS THROAT Mom, Dad, we actually have some big news of our own. Allison. Well... What? got a promotion. Wahey. Attagirl! Vice president. Whoa! And... ...there's something else. Mm-hmm? Well, the position is in New York and we'll be moving there this summer. Holy smokes, that...that is big news. What? love New York. Oh, you've got to know we're going to come and visit a lot. Well, we would love that. What? know this is a really big change, but Jim and What? think... ...it could be an adventure for our family. You know, I've been thinking about getting an RV. We could ride up to see them and catch the sights on the way. What do you think, Claire? Mm. Yes. Congratulations, Allison. Car's put away. Are you still pouting? What? don't pout. Your baby boy doesn't need you any more. He belongs to Allison now. It'll be all right. 'I'm teasing. I'm going to miss him too. Look at the bright side - finally it will just be the two of us. Why don't you let me take your mind off things? What? could take a little blue pill. Claire. Yeah. HUMS KNOCKING Are you decent? What? hope not. Hey. Get away from me! What are you doing? Get away! GROANS GRUNTS Sydney, you're going to be late. You want some breakfast? I'm not hungry. Thought What? was going to be late. Teenagers. Am What? right? Hilarious, Dad. She's right. You need some new material. New material? Hey, Sydney, take a look at these. Oh, my God. The concert tickets! You actually got them? Thank you so much, Dad. Thank you. That is so awesome. OK. Have a good day. PHONE RINGS Oh. Hey, Charlie. Hey! What? know we're supposed to meet for lunch today but I've got contractors coming over and who knows when they'll show up? Oh, that's cool. We can reschedule. Why don't you just eat at my place instead? I've got tonnes of food. OK. Sounds like plan. See you later. Why didn't you just tell him to do the dishes? You're right. You're right. It sounds completely ridiculous, doesn't it? Don't you find it interesting, you have no problem asserting yourself at work yet at home you bite your tongue. All right. You're sounding like a shrink. Jim's a good guy. Just tell him what you need from him. Ah, but that's the thing - What? don't want to have to tell him. I'm his wife, not his mother. Ah-ha! Ah-ha? It always comes back to your mother-in-law. OK. Well, she's a little hard to avoid. What? mean, she stops by all the time. She even comes over to make sure that Jim has enough clean laundry. Did What? tell you that? This is exactly what What? mean. Pathetic, right? That's the thing about biting your tongue. Once you start, it's hard to stop. As soon as What? let her take over that wedding, it was like she had... ...won the war. The war? Wow, Allison. That is a lot of power to let someone have over you for a long time. What is their secret? What? really need to meet this woman. You do not want to meet this woman. Trust me. Did you guys tell her about the move? Last night. You know, and What? was dreading it because What? thought she might get dramatic but she didn't have much to say at all. It all was kind of weird. She's probably in shock. Jim grew up here. What? don't want to call him a mama's boy, but he's kind of a mama's boy. A little bit. And What? love him. Just so we're clear. SIGHS Who's that? That is Bradley. The pool guy. He's cute. Yeah, What? guess he is. You're moving. I'm going to miss you, by the way. I'm going to miss you too, Charlie. So much. Really, Jim? You still haven't done the dishes? I'll take care of the dishes, honey. You've been working all day. Mom, sit down. Allison is right. No woman can stand a messy kitchen. Mom, the dishes can wait. Please. SOBS Something happened. What is it? He left me, Allison. What? Bruce. Ran off with another woman. After 38 years of marriage. Oh, Claire. Are you sure? Did he say anything? He snuck off while What? was doing my shopping. Left me a letter. What? even bought him pork chops. His favourite. I'm sorry, sweetie. You shouldn't have to hear this about your Pop-Pop. It's OK, Grandma. Don't worry about me. No, thank you. That generic stuff you buy, it's too rough on my skin. He met her at the gym. You know how I've been pestering him to exercise? Well, he finally listened. And look what happened. Her name's Missy. Who names a child Missy? Well, Missy made him feel young again. And Missy has a Winnebago. And apparently the two of them are... ...I don't know, touring the national parks or whatever it is people do those tacky things. He'll come back, Mom. He has to. What? should have known something was wrong. Last night when we got home he was so quiet. And What? thought maybe he was upset about you guys leaving. But What? think... ...he realised that... ...he could just go ahead and leave too. I'm going to die alone. Mom, no. Don't say that. SOBS You're right. What? shouldn't say these kinds of things in front of you and Sydney. What? need to be an adult and deal with this myself. Let me just take care of those dishes. I'll get out of your hair and I'm sure you have to start dinner. Forget about the dishes, OK. It's my turn to cook. But none of that matters right now. You cook now? Yeah, you know that. Oh. You are so lucky, Allison. Jim is right. You need to sit and relax. I'll order some food. Well, let me cook. It'll give me something to do. Lord knows What? need something to do right now. No, Claire, I'm going to order something delicious. What? can't eat delivery. It gives me indigestion and it's always cold by the time it arrives. Not to mention the cost. OK. I'm going to cook. Are you sure? What? don't mind. It's fine. You guys relax. Is there anything What? can get you? Maybe some wine. What? don't drink on weeknights, and I'm certainly not going to start now. No offence to you, Allison. What? know how you love your wine. This is very nice, Allison. You're a dear. I'm glad you like it. The sauce is a little salty, isn't it? What? wonder what Bruce had for dinner. Do you think Missy made him pork chops? What? want you to stay here tonight. Oh, nonsense. What? couldn't impose. No, you wouldn't be imposing. Well, What? don't even have my pills or creams. I'll run to your house and pick up whatever you need. What? don't know. Mom, What? insist. Jim, you haven't even asked Allison. What? mean, I'm sure she doesn't want the burden of company right now. Allison doesn't mind, right? No, of course not. You're welcome to stay as long as you want. What? do work in here sometimes. What? can move my stuff if you like. Please. My mind is cluttered enough already. What? can't bear a cluttered room. Who's Charlie? Just a friend. What? never denied him sex, you know. Not once in 38 years. Oh. What? can't imagine what you must be going through, Claire. Would kill you to call me Mom? Just once? I'm sorry. Don't mind me. I'm just getting my bearings. What? understand. It's going to take some time. Jim will be back soon with your things and there's fresh towels on the bed. Get yourself settled and let me know if you need anything. What a mess. KNOCKING Yeah. Hey- HEY- You OK? Yeah. You want to talk about what's going on with your grandparents? What? don't know. It's all just really weird. Why would Pop-Pop do that to Grandma? What? don't know, honey. Adults don't always behave rationally. Everything OK? Oh, yes. What? was just going to wash these sheets and towels. Those are all clean. They seem a little dusty. You know my allergies. OK. Let me wash them for you. No, you've done enough already. And I'm very particular about my laundry. Do you have fabric softener? Yes. ls it that generic stuff? What? don't remember the brand. Well, I'll make do. And do you have any laundry you'd like Grandma to do for you, Sydney? Oh, no, thank you, Grandma. What about a snack? You barely touched dinner. Seemed like you didn't care for it. Yeah, sure. I'm a little hungry. Sydney can make her own snack. You really should take it easy, Claire. These hands were not meant to be idle. Fridge looked pretty bare but Grandma will whip you up something yummy. OK. Oh, and where are your cleaning supplies? Under the kitchen sink. What is it you need to clean? Bruce Pulmer here. Unless you're trying to sell me something. Leave a message. Dad, what the hell is going on? Call me as soon as you can. What? always thought my dad and What? were really close. Now all of a sudden What? feel like What? don't even know him. It's got to be some fleeting thing. What? mean, he's got to come back. Right? My mom does everything for him. Yeah. What? hope so. BRUSHING Grandma. Ah. Hi, honey. What are you doing? What? don't know. Just keeping my mind off your grandfather, What? guess. This floor needed it. Between you and What?, this whole house needs a good scrubbing. You don't need to do that, Grandma. You should go to sleep. What? like doing it. I'm going to be taking care of a lot of things around here, for you and your dad. And your mom. I'm really glad that you're here. Have no fear, Grandma is here. G'night. Night, dear. Must be nice, sleeping in like that. It's 7:00am. Breakfast is on the table. Dig in before it gets too cold. What? don't really eat breakfast. Thank you, though. Well, that's what Sydney said. This is the best breakfast I've ever had, Grandma. It is the most important meal of the day. All three of them are important, but we'll call it a three-way tie. The girl needed it. She is wasting away. Oh, What? guess you didn't know that condiments expire. Most people don't. No, What? don't. It smells delicious in here. Good morning, sweetie. You didn't have do all this. Somebody's got to take care of you guys. Look at my little boy, all grown-up. Did you iron my shirts last night? Of course What? did. What? snuck in while you two were sleeping. Oh, and don't worry, Allison, your snoring will be our little secret. Although you might want to get that checked out. What? know an excellent doctor who helped my friend's husband. Saved their marriage. Eat, mister. So, how do you like that coffee? What? prefer it a little stronger. It's decaf. Bet you didn't know that. No, What? didn't. What? would love to help you kick the caffeine habit. You drink far too much. It's giving you wrinkles. It's a double shot, right? Yeah. So, What? feel like a fool. Call me old-fashioned. So, What? feel like a fool. Call me... "old-fashioned. What? thought he still considered me, well, sexy. How embarrassing is that? What? thought he still considered me... ...well, sexy. How embarrassing is that? Don't say that, Claire. You're a beautiful woman. Bless your heart, Will. But What? know you're just saying that to make me feel better. No, I'm not. You're gorgeous. Do you have a tissue? Oh, sure. Of course. Sorry. Thank you. What? feel like an old car that Bruce got sick of. Everybody always wants the new model. You know? Claire, you're going to have to stop that kind of talk. You are the most incredible person I've ever met. Really? Yes, really. Have you heard from him? What? want to do something for you. Well, maybe there's something you could do. Name it, it's done. What? don't want to get you in trouble. I'm a big boy. It's not about Bruce, it's Allison. I'm afraid she might be up to something. Allison? Like what? Well, What? caught a glimpse of a message on her computer from some man named Charlie. What? got the impression that they meet regularly. Well, maybe it's someone from work. Well, she said it was just a friend. But who says somebody is just a friend unless they're, well, something more than a friend? I'll look into it. Yes. Hopefully it's just nothing. Oh, What? didn't know you were here. Rough clay? Sydney wanted her grandma's famous chilli. Thursday night is pizza night. Pizza? Every week? Yep. Well, I'm not one to break family traditions. Even unhealthy ones. But What? think Sydney's got her heart set on chilli. Isn't he adorable? We stopped by and picked up a few things today at my house. Let me tell you, Allison, as soon as What? walked in What? just started bawling. Hey. It's OK. What? was so miserable. What? just don't think What? can ever go back to that house. Dad finally texted me back. What did he say? It was weird. Really impersonal. Said he needed space. What? told him What? was embarrassed for him. He didn't respond to that one. Think What? should text my dad again? Not right now. They're sleeping. We'll be real quiet. Argh! Oh, she's sleepwalking. She used to do this when she got really stressed out. We're not supposed to wake her up. Come on. Every single thing What? do, she tears it apart. What? mean, What? don't take care of Jim and Sydney properly. What? work too much. What? drink too much. What? don't do the dishes or clean or do the laundry properly. It's all so sexist. Just, it makes me want to scream! And the leprechauns. Did What? tell you about the leprechauns? You did. Have you...l don't know, talked to her about any of this? That's a no. You don't think What? should just, you know, try to keep the peace for the next few months until we move away? You need to stand up to her before it's too late. Yeah. Put this crazy lady in her place. Mm-hmm. OK. What? can do that. What? will let you know how it goes. Hi, Claire. Oh, Allison. Don't you just love this frame? Where did our family photo go? Oh, What? changed it for this one. Why did you do that? Well, What? just love this picture so much. And I've been so sad lately. It just makes me feel better to see it. But What? can change the other one back if you like. Yes, please do that. Of course. It's your house. Wait, Claire. What? would like to talk to you. Let's sit down. First of all, What? understand what you're going through and What? can't imagine how disorienting this must all be for you. And I'm happy to have you here. You are? Yes, of course. But, erm... What? just think it would be better for everyone if you could just try to adapt a little to the way we do things around here. Adapt. Yeah, you know, you don't have to do so much. You should relax. Relax. Yeah. What? have a certain way of doing things and it would just be... Claire. SIGHS Not to me. Maybe finish your own work first. What? don't have any. You're going to have to ask your mom. She has final say. You're home early. What's wrong? Mom? What are you doing. What's wrong, Grandma? Can you show me how to call an Uber, sweetheart? What? think it's best What? not drive right now. Where are you going, Mom? What's going on. Ask Allison. Claire, What? didn't say anything. It seems my being here has become a burden. And that's the last thing What? wanted. What? was just trying to help. But Allison is right. This is her house and it's time that What? went back to my own home. What? didn't say anything like that at all. SOBS What? don't want to be alive any more. Don't say that, Mom. Please don't say that. Everything's going to be OK, Grandma. Please don't leave. WAILS What the hell did you say to her? What? told her that she should relax and, you know, just try to go with the flow around here. What does that even mean? It means that we have a routine and she's welcome to be a part of it. But I'd like to stick to it. She's just trying to help out. The man she's been with most of her life is out there with some other woman. Think about how that feels. What? have thought about how that feels, and What? told her that. What else you tell her? That's it. That's it. Yes, that's it, Jim. Do you think I'm lying? THEY GIGGLE That was adorable. Sydney, you always know how to cheer me up. Tell me, how are you feeling about this big move to New York? Erm, What? don't know. It's kind of exciting but it's kind of scary. Of course it is. You have so many nice friends here. Mom says I'll make new friends. Plus we'll still come back and visit. Mm. What? It's just you'll be going into high school. What? hate to say this but teenage girls, they just love to find somebody new to pick on. But I'm sure your mom's right. You are so sweet. Who would want to do that? Well, part of the problem is that What? have kept my mouth shut for too long about too many things. So what things are you talking about? Just a bunch of little things. Like what? Like comments about me not being good enough. Oh, she doesn't mean it. That is how she is with everyone. That is not how she is with everyone. And she always just feels like it's OK to stop by unannounced. Always! You didn't even ask me before you gave her a key to the house. And that was how long ago? You never said you had a problem with it. No. You're right. What? didn't. And What? should have. You never complained about the free baby-sitting or how she looks after the house when we're out of town, also for free. What? bet you'll miss that when we're in New York. All right, let's just stop because you're not hearing me, Jim. Let's stop. Great idea. You know what? I'm going to take a shower. Hey. How's it going? How long has she been asleep? Not long. We should wake her. She'll probably be more comfortable in bed. Just leave her alone. SHE MOUTHS I've got good news. Yeah? Yes? Charlie turns out to be Charlene Cansfield. She's a woman. She's Allison's friend and they have lunch together. Oh. What's the matter? What? thought you'd be happy with that news. Oh, of course What? am. Well. As happy as What? can be these days. You know, Claire. You look... ...really nice today. I'm sorry. What? just...whoa. You don't ever have to apologise for paying me a compliment. Cutie. Well, the good news is that... ...not likely that Allison is sneaking around on Jim. But this jolly lady, on the other hand, that's a totally different story. Oh? Do tell. Yeah, well, What? saw her playing kissy face with the pool guy in spite of the wedding band on her finger. Is that right? Mm. Mm. What? don't even own a pool. What? guess I'm doing something wrong. You're adorable. This is my lucky day. What's that? Will you excuse me a moment? Of course. Mariah? ls that you? Claire. Come here, you! So good to see you. It's been so long. Look at you. More beautiful than ever. What? always said you and Jim made the most gorgeous couple I've ever seen. Too sweet. How is Jim? He's great. What? know he'd love to see you. You have to come for dinner. No. Yes. What? won't take no for an answer. OK. Then What? won't say no. Perfect. See you. THEY LAUGH Gross, guys. What was that for? What? missed you. Really? What? thought about some of the things you said last night and What? think you're right. What? wasn't really listening to you and I'm sorry. Thank you. Dinner's going to be ready soon. What? already ate. Hmm. I'm going to go take a bath. Allison. Yeah. Next time maybe you could tell me if you eat elsewhere. What? just hate to waste food. She's a big girl, Mom. Big girls have good manners. What? hope that's supposed to be a joke, by the way. Don't say stuff like that, Mom. Please. Sure, Claire. I'll let you know next time. And there's nothing wrong with leftovers. Bruce loved leftovers. You mean loves them, right? He's not dead, Mom. What's wrong? Nothing. You sure? Why are we whispering? Because What? don't want any interruptions this time. DOOR CLICKS What was that? Nothing. DOOR CLICKS OK, What? heard it that time. Sydney should be in bed by now. I'll check. GAS PS Oh, my God. Mom. Jim. Come on, Mom. Hello. Hello. Can What? help you? I'm sorry to bother you. It's just What? used to live in this house a long time ago, back when my dear Richard was still living. What? just had the most perfect life here. How nice. We love it here too. I'm Charlie. It's nice to meet you, Charlie. My name's Marilyn. Would you like to take a look inside? Well, maybe just a little peek. Come on in. Oh, What? love what you've done with the space. Well, this is how it was when we moved in. We're getting ready to redo everything. Make it your own. That's good. Ah! How nice. ls he your son? Erm, no, he's our pool guy. Is he even 18? Hm? Don't tell me you're breaking child labour laws, Charlie. Bradley's 25. Everything's on the up and up. 25. Still a baby. Oh, What? love these countertops. Hmm. Children? Yes. Ten and seven. Cherish them. Before you know it they'll be all grown-up and you won't know what to do with yourself. Take it from me. Yes. That must be tough. What? have the best son in the world. He treats me like a queen. The only problem is his wife. Oh, what's the problem? Well, sometimes What? worry she's just a no good dirty bitch. She's ungrateful. Disrespectful. Some people seem to think she's pretty, but What? don't see it. She drinks too much. She's a lacklustre mother. She's probably a frigid wife. Oh, yes. You know her. What are you talking about? LAUGHS What? told a little lie. It was very exciting. My name's not really Marilyn. It's Claire. My daughter in law's name is Allison. Not surprisingly, her own parents are a couple of deadbeats who couldn't even pay for the wedding. Allison almost talked Jim into eloping. Luckily What? got wind of that and What? took care of everything. It was beautiful. But do you think she thanked me? Oh, yes. She thanked me. But she didn't mean it. She resented it. She resented me. What? knew you must be crazy. But What? had no idea. Poor Allison. This explains a lot. It's time for you to go, Claire. How did it start between you two? Excuse me?! You and Bradley. Bit tawdry, isn't it, sleeping with the help? What? don't know what you're talking about. Oh! Listen, What? get it. What? mean, What? slept with the same man for 38 years. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude. But after a while, it's like, enough is enough and you just want to shove your husband into the nearest freezer! You need to go! Now! Does David know? How about Stella and Jack? Do they know about mommy's special friend, Bradley? My Bruce was a detective. His ex-partner is still on the job. He has a little crush on me. And my, oh, my, did he dig up some dirt on you, girl! Don't worry. The last thing What? want to do is break up a family. There's no need for that to happen. What? just need a little favour, that's all. So, anything new with your mother-in-law? Well, she showed up in our bedroom last night, right when Jim and What? were about to have sex again. Supposedly, she was sleepwalking. What? don't know, What? feel like she might be doing it on purpose. That seems...pretty far fetched. Well, What? don't know. It seems to me like everything she does is calculated. She is the master of manipulation. She will provoke me on purpose and then play the victim if What? bite. Are you OK? Expecting a phone call? What? You keep looking at your phone. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm just thinking of how to put this. Oh? There's only one way to say it. You're starting to sound like a real bitch, Allison. What? I'm sorry. But think about it, this woman's husband just ran out on her. And you're mad about what? Her doing the cooking, cleaning the house and sleepwalking?! No. No! What? mean... Haven't you heard anything I've said? Yes. I've heard everything you've said. But when's the last time you listened to me? When's the last time you asked about David and the kids? We talk about your family all the time. Not nearly as much as we talk about you. It's all about you lately, Allison. Really...? Really? Yes. What? All right. Well, um, if that's the case, What? am so sorry. So sorry. Do you know how disinterested David's mom is in our lives? What? would love it if she cared half as much as your mother-in-law does. What is going on with you? You have never said anything to me like this ever before. And now, all of a sudden, what, has this all just been a set up for this moment?! Not everyone is out to get you, Allison. Stop being paranoid. Paranoid? Paranoid? Really? You were supposed to be my friend! What? am your friend. I'm actually your only friend because you drive everyone else away! OK. OK. LAUGHTER Sorry about that. That's OK. GIGGLING Hello. How was your clay? Not great. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't forget, Sydney, we're going out later tonight. Do What? have to? You most certainly do, young lady. And don't speak that way to her. What? think it's wonderful that the two of you still have mother-daughter dates. Don't call it a date. It's weird. There is nothing weird about spending quality time with your mother. You understand? What? understand. Good. So, are you excited about the concert with your dad next week? Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Don't forget to bring your bathing suit. Dad says there's a pool at the hotel. That's cool. But, um, you know... What? You guys don't have to keep trying so hard to spend one on one time with me. What? mean, what's the deal? Did you read that in a parenting manual or something? TV COMMENTARY ON Mom, what are you doing? What? told you you don't need to make dinner tonight. Don't mind me. DOORBELL MUTES TV Mariah. Jim. It's so good to see you. You look fantastic! There she is! Hi, Claire. Look at you! You look like a supermodel! Thank you so much for inviting me. Thank you so much for coming on such short notice. It's been way too long. You did know What? was coming, right? Yeah, of course. I just lost track of time. I'm just, um... I'm going to change real quick. Oh, you brought a lovely bottle of wine. You are so thoughtful! Let's crack this baby open, shall we? What? know What? certainly could use a glass! Or three! So, how's school? What's wrong? Nothing. Come on, Sydney. You can tell me. You don't want to hear it. What do you mean? What? mean, I'm worried about moving. I'm worried about losing all of my friends and I'm worried about starting high school without knowing anybody. But we have to. Because of your job. Well, you know, that makes a lot of sense. I'd be worried about those things, too, if What? were in your shoes. But you know your dad and What? are going to be there for you. What? know that's not saying much, but we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think that in the long run this was going to be a really good experience for you. What about Grandma? What about her? We're just going to leave her here? That doesn't seem right. What? still think your grandfather's going to come back. And if he doesn't? If he doesn't, then we'll make sure she's taken care of. Ta ken ca re of? What does that even mean? To be honest, What? don't really know right now, Sydney. It was an incredible meal, Claire. Thank you so much. It was my pleasure. It's so good to see you. To see the two of you together again. It's just like old times. You were the most perfect couple. SHE SIGHS What? always thought you might end up together. A little more? What? shouldn't. Oh! What? just remembered, What? owe my friend Susie a phone call. I'm going to go do that right now. Don't you dare go any place, OK? You two have to catch up. OK. You really didn't know that What? was coming over tonight, did you? You know what this feels like? What? That scene where the kids are trying to trick their parents into getting back together. Right. She doesn't let just anybody eat off this china. Sshh! Stop! What? can't... She's going to hear us. Easy now. Remember to breathe. What? haven't laughed like that since... SIGHS Hey... ...it's really good to see you. It's good to see you. Then, if you want to talk about anything, I'm here. Thanks, Jim. Hi, Allison. Yeah, no, this isn't... This isn't awkward. Allison. What's going on? Nothing. We just had dinner. Yeah. What? can see that. Really, Allison. It's not what it looks like. Oh, yeah? What's it look like to you? Like... ...a romantic dinner. Yeah. Basically. But Jim didn't orchestrate this. Oh. No, What? can tell that Jim didn't make this meal, thank you very much. This is Claire's handiwork. Yeah, she called me and invited me over, but Jim didn't know. Can Jim not speak for himself? Come on. Mariah's just trying to explain. That your mom tricked you both into a romantic dinner and you were helpless to do anything, except for eat the meal and hold hands. Is that about right? You don't understand. You know what? What? should... Am What? right? What? should leave. Yes, you should. Allison, you're being rude. Your daughter just saw you being intimate with another woman, you realise that? What? realise Sydney saw me holding a friend's hand and I'm going to explain to her exactly why. What? can't wait to hear that. I'm sorry, Allison. Mariah, you don't have to go. Yeah. Yeah, What? do, Jim. Let me at least show you to your car. What a gentleman(!) Shut up, Allison. Where is everybody? Sorry What? ruined your little scheme, before Jim and Mariah could fall in bed together. My little scheme? That's right. You don't scheme against anybody. You never have ulterior motives, do you? I'm confused. What is it you're implying, Allison? I'm not implying anything. I'm accusing you of setting up this dinner to cause a rift between Jim and What?. My Lord! What? would never, ever, ever do such a thing! You did do such a thing, Claire. And congratulations, it worked. SHE SIGHS How was Mariah? What? didn't get a chance to say goodbye. She's OK. It just breaks my heart. What? mean, look at her. She seems so healthy. What do you mean? Jim? What? know she doesn't look it, but Mariah's been pretty sick for a while. What? don't know how much time she has left. It's just so sad. Isn't it? Why didn't you tell me? What? don't know. What? should have. I've had a hard time processing it myself. She ran into my mom a few clays ago and texted me and I've just been trying to listen to how she feels. She's scared. What? mean, of course she is. What? know what it must look like. Like my mom was trying to rekindle some old flame, but What? think she was just trying to make Mariah feel good for an evening. I'm going to talk to Sydney. What? need to explain what was going on. Allison? Yeah, no, go ahead. SHE SIGHS Oh, hi, Will. What? just wanted to hear your voice. Things have been a little tense around here. To be frank, it's Allison. If What? didn't know better, What? would be worried. Oh, What? just never realised what a bad temper she has. It's a little scary. Oh, I'm sure it's nothing, just me being a worry wart. How about you, sweetie? How was your day? Have fun at the concert! Send me lots of pictures. OK. What? love you. Bye, Grandma. See you tomorrow. Miss you, baby. Call you later. Take care of your daddy. You drive safe, you hear me? No fighting, you two. Us? Fight? Bye. Have fun! I'm going to make us a nice dinner tonight, Claire. We need to talk. What? thought What? would cook tonight. No, I'm going to cook. But first, I'm going to go for a run. Since when do you run? Since right now. DOORBELL Great(!) Now what?! Oh. We're eating in the dining room. And using the china. If it's good enough for Jim and Mariah, it's good enough for you and me, right? Have a seat. Stir fry. Looks very nice. Though What? never cared for it. No, thank you. It's not a week night, live a little. What shall we toast to? To new beginnings. If you say so. It's not that two buck chuck stuff, is it? Let's eat. What? called Mariah. What? needed to apologise for the way What? treated her. Good for you. What? know it's not easy for you to admit to your mistakes. That was a good move on your part. The way you made me look bad like that. But it wasn't very fair to Mariah, was it? Oh, Allison. What? never tried to make you look bad. Um, yeah, you have. Many, many times. Why do What? feel like I'm being ambushed here? No ambush. What? just think it's time for the two of us to be honest with each other. I'm always honest with you. Are you sure there's nothing you want to get off your chest? No. No problem you have me? Now's your chance. Anything you want to say at all? Is this dinner or family therapy? What? made the mistake at the beginning for not putting my foot down, for not setting boundaries, starting with letting you take over the wedding. That was my fault, and What? shouldn't have done that. Most brides would have killed for that wedding! That's true. But your son was marrying me and it's not what What? wanted. Is there a point to this, dear? You're a wonderful mother. You've raised a fantastic son. He is respectful and caring. And you're a fantastic grandmother. Sydney adores you. But either you treat me with respect, or get out of my house. Understood. OK. Mm-hm. Good. Tell me, Allison, did you use a meat tenderiser on this steak? You know? Whack! Whack! Whack! Um, actually, What? did. Mm. What? knew it. Mm! So, your mom and What? finally had a long talk tonight. Yeah, What? think we really hashed some things out. Yeah. Well, What? think it went pretty well. Yeah? I'm glad Sydney enjoyed the concert. What? miss you guys. What? love you. See you tomorrow. Good night. Hello, it's Will. Leave a message. Will. I'm so afraid! It's Allison! What? need your help! Will! Claire. You're sleepwalking again. What...? Argh! Ah! Ah! Ah! What are you doing? What am What? doing? What anybody would do if their daughter-in-law went crazy in the middle of the night and tried to kill them. I'm defending myself. Oh, my God! Argh! Oh... Argh! Argh! You ungrateful... You never, ever deserved my son! Argh! Oh! Claire! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, Will! Oh, thank God you got my message! She went crazy! She said she was going to get rid of me the same way she got rid of Charlie. Charlie?! What are you talking about? You tried to stab me! SHE tried to stab me! She tried to kill me! You are insane! You don't know what you're talking about! You stop right there! Don't let me pull out my gun, Allison. What? don't want to, but What? will. Will, you don't understand. That's not what happened. Yeah, yeah, fine. You stay right there and you show me your hands. Oh! You just saved my life! Is that...? ls that what she used to kill Charlie? What? believe it's the murder weapon. Yes. Wiped clean of fingerprints. We found it in your closet, Allison. Oh, come on, Will! Think about it! If What? did do it, why would What? hold on to that thing? You don't really believe that What? killed my best friend? What? loved Charlie. Loved her. Oh, my God! What? can't believe this is happening! Will, you know me. You know me! Why would What? do something like that? The pool guy said that you and Charlie had a really big argument the other day. Yeah? So what? So, what was it about? It was about Claire. Oh! God! Yeah, somehow Claire put all this together. Yeah! She definitely had something to do with this. Oh! It's always Claire's fault, isn't it? The woman who raised your husband, your daughter's grandmother! The poor woman who's dealing with the fact that her husband ran off with another woman after nearly four decades of marriage! When can What? see Jim? Who you really need to see is a lawyer. Please, Will, What? just want to see Jim. Please! Will! You're wrong! Oh, my God! No! SOBS What? think all the stress must have just got to her. Her job, the move. Lord knows, I'm not the easiest house guest, I'm sure What? just made things worse. Jim? Allison's not a killer, Mom. What? know she's not. 24 hours ago, What? would have said the exact same thing, but, Jim, she tried to kill me. Do you understand that? You do believe me, don't you? Jim? I'm your mother! You can see her now. Where's Sydney? What? took her round to Kelly's. She doesn't know what's going on yet. OK, good. Good. That's good. Allison, what is going on? You know What? didn't do it, right? Any of it! Jirn. Listen to me very carefully. It is time for you to make a decision. You either choose me or you choose your mother. What? choose you. Of course What? do, Allison. OK. Good answer. Now, What? need you to go to your parents' house right now and before she has a chance to get rid of anything. What would she be getting rid of? Listen to me very carefully. Look around. Check the entire house. What am What? looking for? Jim, What? hope that I'm wrong, but What? don't think that your dad ran off with another woman. What? What? mean, do you really think that your dad would do that to your mom? What? don't think so. And even if he did... ...I mean, do you really think that that he would ignore you this whole time? No. He loves you more than anything. You're the most important thing in the world to him. He would at least want a chance to explain himself to you. OK, OK. All right, I'll go there now. OK. OK, good. Go! What? love you. Great. She forgot to pay the power bill. Flashlight, flashlight... What? hope you're wrong about this, Allison. Claire. Oh, Will. Is everything OK? Oh. Oh, What? see. It's a shame about the china. It was such a lovely set. POLICE RADIO CHATTER Guess we start cleaning up before Sydney comes home. Yeah. Are we OK? Yeah. We're good. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
