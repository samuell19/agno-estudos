Monelle - Mrs. Constant, how are you? - Very well, thank you. Lucky charms, get your lucky charms here. - A lucky charm, sir? - Yes... - How much? - Ten francs. Give me seven, for the week. - Go on. - All right. One... two... three... four... five... What an idea to sell them in a little place like this. There's a wedding. Special events are better business. Thank you. 70 francs, please. - Do you sell many? - It depends. - Today? - I've sold seven. I'm waiting until they're drunk... Because then they believe in luck. Thank you. He knew the pampas He knew the caracole And all the little Creoles felt their heart racing For Jimmy, for Jimmy For Jimmy the bandit For Jimmy, for Jimmy For Jimmy, Jimmy the bandit Thank you. - Gerard Fewer. - Excuse me? - My name. - Why are you telling me? You should always know names. Lighter, carafe, CUP, Gérard Favier. Chair, scarf... Sylvia. Thank you. Cover it, cover it. The king, cover him. You lack curiosity. What a pity. He was full of good intentions. You have a bright future ahead. No, not me, your cards. - True, I may be in it. - Won't you leave me be? We have exchanged names, we're even. Good day, sir. I'm expecting someone. - But I'm here. - Leave me be! - Okay. - Finally. Let me finish... You're at the cinema... - The cinema? - Yes, imagine you were there. You're with me. The film begins. A man, rather handsome, enters a little bistro in the Paris area. The setting. A beautiful woman is there playing patience. Her scarf has fallen on the floor and as he picks it up, he sees her face. At that point, you lean over to me and say: "Not the prettiest." I reply, "No, she's worse." The scene continues. The main actor is very attracted to the heroine. He goes to tell her but she imposes silence, so... he insists, she gets angry, he tries again, she shies away. But you turn to me in the cinema and say: "Will this go on much longer? "The two stars always end up falling in love. "Come on, just smile at the man and let the film begin." That's what you'd say if we were at the cinema. Let's not waste any time. Give me a smile, now, won't you? Excuse me, sir, at what time is the coach for Paris? It's 50 metres to your right, sir. Thank you, sir. My pleasure. So, I'm not pretty? May I? One. Two, three... and a half. Seven days of luck. I'd like to share it. If you wish, we can be happy for three and a half days. You oaf! I'm not a passing fancy. Three and a half days' happiness in ten years is an excellent average. And it's three days, the nights aren't included. I can offer you three days and 1001 nights. And if I accept? You only know my name. - Don't you like me? - You fool. Didn't I tell you? I knew he'd come. She was getting fed up, she almost left. You had a meeting? - With whom? - You, darling, look, he's jealous! What can I get you? Care to join me? Two fine brandies. - With all my heart... - And my best wishes. Here you go, for two. - To God's grace. - To the devil's beauty. You were perfect. "Pause in your trek O Time! Pause in your flight, favorable hours." We met at 1.25 pm. - Remember? - It was... - Thirty-five minutes... - And 18 years ago. - Same place. - Same awful drink. Same portrait of Falliéres and out-of-date calendar. And a wedding like this one. You picked up the same scarf just as nonchalantly. And I felt the same butterflies. You see? We can relive fleeting moments. - Relive memories. - And you didn't want to come. - Our love hasn't changed. - It knows us. Is it still as off-key, this heap we call a piano? I always wondered what good it was there. What did I play that day? That's right... - Careful, they're fragile. - Okay. Hey, there's music here! Marcel! - Marcel! - Yes? What's that? I bet you don't remember. Your first concerto! I can't forget something that bad. When I think that you played it for Rubinstein so he'd use it. And use it he did. He said it was admirable and he'd play it himself. It was to be our secret. The audience would never know. You know, all things considered, this is a lovely passage. It's not mine... it's Mozart. Tell me, sir. Forgive me, ma'am, could I have a word with him? I'm the best man. I see, and? We had booked musicians for 12.30 pm but they're not yet here. Wrong wedding, maybe? - They probably missed the coach. - And? We heard you play. The owner said that you were professionals. I would like to ask you if you would replace the orchestra? A wedding without a dance... ls a funeral. Of course, money is no concern. We'll pay you a fee. And should the lady wish, she can pass the hat. - It's clear you're artists. - If there's a hat... Okay, let's go! Let's go! It's very kind. We'll take the piano outside. Please, have a glass of champagne for now. - It'll liven things up. - It will. Auguste, Emile, Pierrot, they've agreed to do it. We need to move the piano. - How nice... - And not at all proud! - What shall I play? - Improvise. - Could I have your name, please? - My name? Yes, my name is... Quatuor Caplet. - Quatuor... - Caplet. Quatuor Caplet. It's finally time to dance. Playing the piano, Mr. Castor Caplet. It's real sparkling wine. To the bride! To the bride. It's good and the right temperature. It is top quality. Which one is the bride? The daughter of the big lady, see? - And the groom? - A childhood friend. - Good job? - Yes, at the post office. He delivers the letters. - He's a postman, as they say? - Yes! It was on the tip of my tongue. - Care to dance? - With pleasure. - Gérard, this isn't the Salle Pleyel! - Of course. Who isn't dancing over there? Grandmother, don't you dance? - I'm too old for that. - Do you know the polka? Gérard, a polka for the grandmother. The best man will dance with you. Off you go. Come on, Grandma. And you, sir, why aren't you dancing? You need to do your moustache proud. - If you ask, I won't say no. - Well, into my arms, Colonel. Look at that! I was staff sergeant. What a pleasure, then. Come on, ma'am! Thank you, ma'am. Don't forget your contribution for the artists. - Be generous. - Quickly, sir, time is money. Thank you. Sir, the good Lord will repay you with honesty. Ma'am, a thought for the artists. Your friend, there, I take my hat off to her, she's the life of the party! - And she knows how to work. - She's quite the business-woman. Well, there you are! What a nice surprise. You took your time. Ladies, gentlemen, keep the money coming. I hope you'll choose us again. Ma'am, gratefully yours. On that note, ma'am, that's all for today, thank you. - Already? - Yes, they came by bicycle. They took the wrong road twice and each earned a speeding ticket. - Are you sure about the fee? - The hat is fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Impeccable. What a wedding, the bride was beautiful. - Good evening. - Good evening. Aren't you staying? - We're off for a stroll. - In the woods. It all went well, thankfully, you were here. - Do you do many weddings? - No, we mainly do circuses. - With the sea lions. - Look at that, you're a somebody. - Yes. See you soon, boss. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Well, a good deed done. - And the sparkling wine? A top vinegar. - And the bride? - She'll make a pretty widow. And this? Lucky charms, lovely lucky charms. Are you still here, you? Come here. Here, we'd like to contribute to your income. - Is all that for me? - Sometimes lucky charms work. - Well I never! - Don't mention it. Mr Bourret, who were those customers? What's it to you? Look, she forgot her scarf. - Say! - What? - I love you. - Great idea. It's an idée fixe. Recognise the trees? We're on a first-name basis, they were our first witnesses. - This old birch. - They haven't aged. Remember? We sauntered in silence and then... Look, the other one. Still here! We sat on this bench. - I can picture us. - It was... Today. And that's how it was. That was the day you promised me a love song just for me. - I often think of that song. - Yet haven't written it. But there are already love songs perfect for you. How did it go? The song you sung to me. You placed your hand on my shoulder so effortlessly - and then... - Like this... I lost my love without deserving it Because of a rosebud I kept from her... I've loved you for so long I will never forget you I've loved you for so long I will never forget you And that's how Gérard met Sylvia, on a beautiful autumn day. End of chapter one. - We returned to Paris by train. - It was still light out... - We dreamt of each other. - At 60 km/h, every man for himself. - Paris! - Everyone off. Terminus... or starting point? - We dawdled in the street. - We didn't want to part ways. Pleasure to meet you, let's do this again. - We strolled... - We weren't pressed... - We stopped and I said: - "Which way are you?" I took you suddenly by the arm. - And we were almost... - Hit by a taxi. - "Watch it, lovebirds!" - I was elated. - We wandered... - For hours. You told lengthy stories. - I pretended not to notice you kiss me. - I did so to justify my presence. - We ended up somewhere. - You said, "I live on lle St Louis.“ "Care to visit?" And we haven't left since. - You loved it instantly. - Yes. I'm terribly tired and hungry! Did you prepare the champagne? We've been 18 since 1.25 pm, it's allowed. - I prepared three bottles. - That hungry? - Isn't that...? - It is! It's my concerto. That isn't bad at all. He is an exceptional pianist. She is. It's a woman. No... a young girl. - Young girl? - Yes, listen. She's a novice. She has imagination and sensibility. She is romantic, secretive yet spontaneous. - She's still dreaming of her life. - Now you're digressing. She's just a child. Let's hear the allegro. I'm very pleased with her. She is too accomplished to be a girl. What would you bet? - Tell us, sir. - A young girl, sir. - See? - You win. She studies all day, I don't even notice it now. She is great. Impossible to say, she plays nothing known. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Let's go. - Is that my sonata? - So it seems. I've taken over. She is beautiful. Bravo, miss, you are both a grand pianist and musician. You didn't choose the easiest piece. Gérard Favier's sonata. He has better. - Perhaps. - Certainly. A brilliant start but weak end. - A weak end? - Yes, listen... I find that awful. Her judgement seems sound. Favier is one of my modern favorites. Give it 100 years. Her taste is also sound. In any case, I'm delighted, I know what he wanted from this music. I know the composer. - You know him? - Of course. - Are you a friend? - Sometimes. - Are you, too, a composer? - Yes, too. I wrote the concerto you played before that weak sonata. Forgive me. - Get back to it. - Please, come in. - Go on. - Wait, the door! Nonsense. There. There, Gérard Favier. Ma'am. Well I never. I would have had stage fright had I known. I had it listening to you. I thought, "it can't last," yet it was wonderful to the end. I love your music. - I know it all. - Impossible. I heard your symphonic poem at the Gaveau hall. - Dear Master Pianist... - No, he hates that. And it ages me. Monelle. Monelle! Excuse me. I say, Monelle... Sorry. My brother, Mr and Mrs Gérard Favier. Sir, ma'am. Remove that pipe! What? It isn't a hat. I didn't hear you come in. Another musician? He's in high school. And let's be honest, about to fail it. My third try: I'm a dunce. - Stop showing off, you're not. - I am! - I only ever tell the truth. - Jules! Don't call me that! It's Douglas. Jules... another of the family's brainwaves. - Jules gives me a complex! - Anyhow, your sister has talent. You see! I told you. Please, have a seat. And she deserves it, having talent in such an atmosphere... fake Louis XVI, chromos, bronze art... and that putrid smell, did you notice? The place strips me of my means. Well get out of this place, It's part of me now. You lack optimism. He has no self-confidence. Nonsense, of course I do! The world scares me. It turns too fast giving me vertigo. And I worry about others' opinions. Especially if they're like mine. I think your pocket is on fire. It's just my pipe, calm down. I mean look at this jacket. Having an honest father: twenty years at the same bank, sergeant in two wars yet he's scared at the black market. What a time... Out with heritage. I'll show you my origins. Father. You came at a bad time. He was amazed to see you. He's a fiery shy boy. Mr Michel Picart. My father. Mrs Favier. Mr Gérard Favier. I am honored sir, ma'am. Forgive my dress, - I was doing DIY. - Having fun with my old mechanic. Monelle, you could have told me that we had guests. Yes, vacuuming would have helped. - Mr... - Picart. Michel Picart. How did you discover her calling? - Well... - By chance? He made her play to annoy the neighbour, he wants to buy them out. Let's not exaggerate. When the radio stops, Monelle does her scales. It'd make anyone mad. Off we go... Who does Monelle work with? She's at the music academy, that's right. - With Marguerite Long? - Yes, a formidable woman. You should come see me. I'd like to hear you more easily and peacefully, study you. - I above all need guidance. - Guidance, of course. But why? You must first learn to be wary of virtuosity. Then it's an affair between you and silence. Musical beauty is in the heart. The rest is technical. As they say, we're here to convey its soul. No, no, my dear, that's not it. The left hand should be more expressive. Listen... Do you see now? That's it, you've got it. Excellent. No, no, no, no, no. That should be lighter, less articulated and more joyful. Play it properly- - ls she joking? - It's been ten minutes. I wouldn't be in a hurry to leave Favier, she's lucky. Now I always work with the window open. But, I'm on the sixth floor. She has until I count to 100! One, two, three, four, five... - Sorry, Favier kept me back. - I can't feel my nose. You're exaggerating, don't get mad, I'll buy you a hot toddy. - What did you work on? - Liszt's rhapsody, and did you know? His method is wonderful to get the notes, with light hands and fingers on... - Off on a trip? - No, shopping. - Why the suitcase? - Suitcase? - Yes. - It's a briefcase. - What's in it? - Stuff. - Like what? - It's private. - Let's see! - No! - I thought you only told the truth. - And aren't I? - I demand to see inside. - I'm allowed my own suitcase. - Not a briefcase? - Leave me be! Off you go, then. I've had enough of your complex, your purity, convictions... You're nothing but a hypocrite! I'm finished with you, I swear. - As mother is my witness. - What a tragedy. Happy? - It's the silverware. - Yes, Captain Obvious. We never use it. It's like Latin. - So? - We never have guests. Even if we do, we hide it from them. - Father is keeping it as capital. - Silver is stagnating. - I need a down payment. - Why? To live. You live here! No, I loiter. I'm fed up. I want to be free, I can't wait. My editor wants 15,000 to do my poems. It's now or never. It's in my horoscope. And is theft, too? I'm no thief, I'm not free enough. - I'll bring it back. - I'm not stupid. Look... On one hand, I have a friend with pre-war tyres on the other, an amateur, and me in the middle. I said I'd pay it back. - If I acted like you... - You have your piano. To each their own. Transparency, obscurity. You don't suffer. A good F and you're happy. But ask your friends if it's enough. - What do they have that I don't? - Contacts. - Contacts? - Yes. Not by going to bars on the Champs Elysées. Bars aren't only for drinking, fool. Heard of parties? No? Stick to the piano, it's more your age. You're not yet pretty. It's the old man, you haven't seen me! Douglas... Jules. Hello, my girl, hello, Monelle. - Father. - Hello, my child. - Did you work hard? - As always. I have something for you. One moment, Monelle, it's a surprise, you'll see. Here, the poster for your recital. Well, for the Festival Favier. Look, your name. We'll be thought highly of. He's very chic. - Who? - Mr Favier. Well, he's only doing his duty. You are his performer, Monelle Picart. Did you see? M, Monelle, like me, Michel. We have the same initials, what luck. M. Picart. If I was told one day I'd have my name on the wall! I'm ready to be famous. Picart! Not many of us are famous. Yet it's a common name. You're not going to cry? My colleagues felt the same way when I showed them it. You know Plantier in cheques? Plantier bought two tickets as did the deputy manager. Wednesday, they'll be there. Make me proud. They're there for me. But I know you will, as they know nothing about music, they can only find you wonderful. It'll be all over Paris, M, Mr Michel, Monelle Picart. My little girl! Come in. - Is it finished? - Yes, I tested it. - Now for your signature. - Here. Thank you. Mr... Mr Picart. It wasn't easy. I made many requests before getting it. We were out of stock. That may be, but I have people to talk to. And for yourself... Here. Thank you. Thank you. - Sir, ma'am. - Goodbye. Are you happy? Now you have your phone. It works. You'll be in the directory. Picart, M, artist. Treasure your first phone as if it were your first doll. - It's to be remembered. - You're ever so sweet. Have you seen my second violin? Second violin... - You're sitting on it. - Thank you. Oh, boy. A cigarette. It's never-ending. - Genius is eternal patience. - Alfred de Vigny. Light? Lighter in your left pocket, matches in your right. You're so suspicious, my poor Ludo. Don't you hear the phone? Hello? Yes. Hello... Really? Wonderful! Let me get him... Monelle. She's delighted. Oh boy! What a surprise. Hello. How kind. So? Nothing? Is that all? So to tell me you have a phone? Right, nothing important? It's a wonderful tool. One moment. Tomorrow, are you lunching with Martine? - Yes. - Perfect. Hello, Monelle? You didn't call for nothing. Remember our rehearsal at 2 pm? Shall we eat together? We'll discuss your phone. Meet me at my house, okay? Work hard until then. Can you hang UP? Can you hang up? No? We'll it's like this... You should cancel with Martine and join us. I've done so twice, she'll soon take offense. Ludo, what on earth? Unbelievable. - What do you need? - The double bass. There, it was under the chair. - Where did you want it? - What an answer. Really, he is incredible. He'll never change. Isn't she charming? She wanted us to be the first on the phone. I hope her recital is a success. Touch wood that it won't go to her head. That's when it gets interesting. Cigarette, Ludo. My cigarettes are in your pocket. With my lighter and matches. Thank you. Thank you. - I wanted to show you my dress. - I trust you. My tailor wanted to make me a lavish one full of things, But the women won't like it. You're like a misanthrope. I'm so nervous. I have a good cure for nerves. An actor shared it with me. Thank you. Monelle, don't worry about the crowd. Focus on one spectator. Play just for him. No, I'll just play for myself, and even then. My music may not be well-received but you will be a success. One, because you play well and two... because you are rather nice to look at, and three, you're new. The audience will discover you. You'll be their creation. They'll adopt you. And you'll become unbearable. Never. I'm humble. Go on, go on... You may mock me but I'm not ungrateful, I know this is thanks to you. You will have compliments, but out of 100 listeners not four will be real critics or able to read a score. Success is a necessarily evil... You'll have many new, fleeting friendships and watch out for men. I'm not interested. - What about a fling? - Oh, no. When I love, it will be forever. I'd like a couple like yours. How wonderful. One day. It's wonderful that somewhere in the world, he's there, unsuspecting, - he doesn't know you exist. - Sorry. He doesn't know and you can't even imagine his face. Fate hides its secrets well. Only it will decide when you meet. You may even have crossed paths already. Let's go. - Jean, the bill, please. - Right away. Papers... Get your papers... Thank you. Paper, sir? - Paper? - Yes, "Entre nous soit dit". - How much? - Fifteen francs. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Papers... May I see? Mr Favier, did you enjoy lunch? Yes, Jean, thank you. - How's the house? - Can't complain! Good. Thank you. Do you read this often? The first time. Its title is funny. It's a vile paper. - Vile? - And moronic. "The maid of the permanent secretary of the Academia Francaise says..." No, I can't. "The novelist loved his niece, so..." Let's not. There we go. It can go down the toilet. What a day we live in... Off to work. - Goodbye, Jean. - Thank you. - Goodbye, sir. - Jean? Yes, sir. Who was that? That's Gérard Favier. - He has a concert soon. - And the girl with him? It's Monelle Picart, his pupil. His pupil, so he says. You don't know the wonderful Mrs Favier. The compositor is playing ingenuity, a fine instrument. A solo of ingenuity is beautiful. Where is this festival? At the... one moment, please, I have a leaflet here. I can't stand modern. - I prefer Bach. - You belong in the 1700s. - Sir, umbrellas are forbidden. - My umbrella? I'm a regular. I always keep my umbrella. Please, don't insist. Good evening. - Evening. - Fool... I was at the Bogolov recital until now. - How was it? - They just played his symphony. I preferred him today to his first audition. - I must have been in a bad seat. - No. First impressions are always right, especially when bad. Victor... Have you heard this new pianist? - They say she's superb. - Say... Well, we'll soon see. I was worried I'd be late. - Have you seen Monelle? - She's very calm, she had soup. There she is. Don't worry, it'll be fine. On you go.- Her dress is beautiful. Yes. After working with Monelle Picart, a young virtuoso aged 17, Gerard Favier has rediscovered his youth and inspiration. Read that. Utterly awful. - It's wonderful. - Wonderful, wonderful. It's terrific. _ I Say. ' Yes? ' Yes? - It's funny. - Why? - Well, do you think Favier... - Favier? Is in love with Monelle? I don't know. Monelle is beautiful and talented. - Put yourself in his place. - He's married. - Who? - Favier? - And? - And what? Divorce wasn't made for single people. _ I Say. ' Yes? - Cuckold. - What? - It says so in the paper. - Fool. Next to Favier, you don't exist. - He'll die before me. - So you say. - She doesn't care about Favier. - You think? She's never mentioned him. All the more reason. - Are you upset? - There are other girls. - I thought you were in love? - Yes, but I'm not stubborn. It's me or nothing. There's no difference. Do you have it? - What? - The paper. - Pass it to me. - Later. No, now. How delicate. - Favier? - No, Monelle. Not sure who she gets it from. Give me my paper back. Such talent. Who, Favier? Yes, too. The composer... I'm here, a little discretion... Composer, composer, composer! Wonderful, Mr Favier. Impressive, you and your protégée! Let's not exaggerate. My dear friend! Feel my hands, they're sweaty with awe. - I almost passed out, such beauty. - Thank you, you are so kind. And you say things so plainly. She is beautiful, a true Picart. When I think I played piano until 14 and not once since, it's disgraceful. - Jules! - Yes? Let me introduce my son, Jules. Mr Poignard, my assistant manager. And my colleague, Plantier, I've mentioned him. I hope you weren't bored. Not at all, it was remarkable. It's not the radio! And there are no technical problems. - Are you coming? - Excuse me. - Where is she? - The foyer. ...even less, it's nothing. Self-taught, a comedian... less than nothing, anteroom music. Chabrier cleaning his nose. I don't like it. Well, I very much do. Love was once blind, now it's deaf. Goodbye. - Won't you stay? - I've heard enough. Your umbrella, my friend. Thank you. There you are! I have to force my way through, let me kiss you. I'm thrilled. You made it your own and defended me admirably. I should kiss you. I'm proud and will never forget what you've done for me. I did nothing, you are talented and I made the most of it. Are you coming to the box? - I'll meet you there. - Box two. - Have you fallen for him? - Congratulations. You'll make history with this love affair. - What on earth? - Does he love you? - Who? - Mozart Favier, Chopin Gérard. You can't say you didn't know. Know what? Here, read this, sound familiar? Go on, go on. Isn't it terrific? See you later. You're so lucky being in love with such a man. I'm not in love with him. Nor he with me. He was right, it's a vile paper. Love at first sight. After working with Monelle Picart, a young virtuoso aged 18, Gérard Favier... ...has rediscovered his youth and inspiration. - It's funny. - Go on. It's all in the title, you can imagine the article. Am I mentioned? Sylvia, his loyal wife, watches on helplessly as this love affair unfolds, it began as a serenade and continues as a trio hopefully it won't end in a divisi. "ln a divisi"... how witty. - You know the papers. - Yes. Thank you for so kindly calling. Hello? What's this? Is someone there? Yes? I've lost you... Goodbye. - Who was it? - No one. - Martine? - Yes. Any news? Nothing interesting. Here... This is what I wanted. A beautiful love song. A foolish and cloying tune. You said that 18 years ago. And I'm still waiting for my very own love song. - You mustn't have loved me enough. - Me? I loved you six-fold. You must have counted wrong. - What is it? - Some interesting stories. Slating me? Read it. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT - The idiot. - And lovely for Sylvia. You fool, we don't listen to these abominations. Sylvia knows how it is. - And Monelle? - What about her? I'm a dinosaur to her, old boy. "...has rediscovered his youth..." How flattering. Sylvia. - What are you doing? - Yes? Martine's phone call... - Hello, Ludo. - Hello. Why not tell me what she said? To see if you'd mention it. To test me? - No, just... - What? Did you believe it? You hadn't seen it, I didn't want to bother you with absurdities. Absurd? Monelle and you, imagine! - Obviously. - Why write such a thing? They write anything, it's common in the US. I have two words for them, in American! I'm young now! Come in. I imagine you've seen this? Amusing, isn't it? It's an abomination, nothing else, a lie. So you do read this vile paper? I thought you scorned it? Yes, and you're about to feel my scorn. Remove your glasses. Please, remove them. If I may. No, listen! My regards, miss. - Nothing for me? - No, why? - The concierge gave you two letters. - Two? - Yes. - No. Hold on, yes. Two useless leaflets. Swear there are no letters? Of course I do, mistress. - Are you quite finished? - Yes, doxy. - Sorry, ladylove. - You twit! I like this Favier, you could be together. He's older but you're younger... What? So you admit it? Go on, vent! You're a madwoman, but I love you anyway. Don't trust me, but I'm giving you advice. So, are you aren't you his mistress? I won't tell. Are you going To CW? You're silly. You can be so horrid. Nobody leave this house! Have you lost something? What's wrong? What's wrong? I'll tell you what. - Have you gone mad? - Thief. You thief! Where is the silverware? - What silverware? - Our only silverware! - Has it been stolen? - Yes. Yes, you know fine well, because you were the one who stole it! " Me? ' Yes- you! I said nothing. Here, did you know? No, I just said so. Well, you should have. I stole it. And it's molten now. Don't worry, I'll pay you back. I have other things to do today! It was a family heirloom. A gift to your great-grandfather - from your great-grandmother. - You didn't even know them! Mr Favier for you, sir. Nobody leaves! Yes, it's Favier. Hello, sir. - What brings you here? - I believe you've seen this article. Of course, I have. I read everything about my girl. - And? - What? - I'm pleased you came to me because... - Because? You know how it is, today my colleagues bombarded me with questions. I was very uneasy. - Uneasy? - Yes, I haven't the full picture. Monelle mentioned nothing of it. But the press isn't as discreet. They tell me what's going on under my roof. I have to say, I didn't realise she was so famous. I hope you don't believe what they're saying about us. You buy money with money. We only share music, Monelle and I. - Only? - Do you doubt me? I take your word. I've just given the paper's editor a hiding. Here's what's left of him. You mustn't bother yourself with it. Well, no matter what, you'll have my support. - Very kind. - Would I have trusted you if you weren't a good man? I'm a father first. I looked into you. Outstanding morality, I'm pleased to say. Thank you. Of course, you're an artist, it can't be denied, but beyond that... Yes, beyond that... that's right. And a man of your age... What do you mean? Well, you are like me, we aren't 20 years old any more. - No more hanky-panky. - Yes... No more of that. But what does that mean? I didn't mean to offend you. Poor wording. We're only as old as we feel. The heart never ages. - Let's not say "fountain". - I won't drink from yours. - There she is. - Hello, Mr Favier. Father, would you be so kind as to leave us? Well... She's all yours. See you later, my child. So, Monelle. I love you. I do. Right, then. "L love you." You don't make such a declaration to a man my age. It's no joke. You, too, believe the papers? It was a false report. It's a tabloid, a joke. - Perhaps. - It put ideas in your head. - You think you love me. - I know so. Think, child. I do, of you, since Wednesday. You see? I told you, it's true. - Do you think it's nice? - In your dreams! The proof? I'm unhappy. Monelle, look at me. It's all I do. Even when you're not here. More proof? You're handsome. Monelle, Monelle... Please. Don't take me for a Don Juan because I came to you at dusk. You're on the ground floor... And I wasn't alone. You love me, too. I like you but love, no. I'll suffer and you'll love me. You need some sense. You didn't love me a week ago. And? Monelle, listen. Listen, stop raving. Look at me. Have you drunk? Yes, I have. But I'm not drunk. I just needed the courage. Now you know. I love you truly. I have the right to do so. I'll love you even if you don't. I love you! It isn't my fault. Forgive me. I'll stop. I love you. Goodbye, Monelle. I know you do but I cannot help you. My love isn't for you. Best to find out sooner than later. Am I so ugly? Let's stop... You're very pretty, I promise you. If you love me, I won't tell. Goodbye, Monelle. No! Don't leave like this, please. I'll never mention it again, ever. I'm not convinced. You have my word. So be it. I believe you. You don't mean it. Will we meet again? When? Listen, I'll prove I trust you. Friday, dinner at mine with Ludo. - You may come. - Yes. But kiss me... kiss me. Good evening, old boy. Good evening, you're early to the saloon. - What weather! - Alabama weather. Better in than out, but you'll soon be used to the sun. The Alabama sun. Barman, a drink for the newbie. Who's the totty, Harrison? The sheriff's daughter. Some totty... - No smoking, sir. - Shame. - Put it out, I'll get caught. - With pleasure. Thank you. ...heat all of Alabama. Wild but easy. Here she comes with her risque perfume. Would you have a light? Thank you. Bye bye, all of you. I belong to Billy the trapper. And there will be hell if you disrespect me. The Alabama sun will no longer rise for you. I've never been spoken to like this before. Don't eye me up like that or you'll be taken care of, you're testing me. Mrs Crocodile, put your claws away. You shouldn't mess with Billy, once a man stepped on his hunting trail, the ravens have his eyes now. Cheers, my friend. Watch out if you want to live to tell your grandchildren your stories. We're all like that in Alabama... We've seen the rest. Yes, let's go. The piano is on the left and the exit, the right. Funny pistol... Alabama will see what an angry ranch owner looks like. It's time to call the grave digger. In short, a dubbed film isn't worth much. - Lost something? - My gloves. - I see. - They'll be on your seat. We'll ask the usher. How haven't you lost me yet? I never lose the essentials. There! So, what's on your mind? Those two... Love suits them. Look at them studying the metro plan. You'd think it was Cartier's window. She desperately wants the Concorde station. But he's not rich enough. Later, maybe later. So she settles for Barbes-Rochechouart. I can hear them, she's saying: "I love you. "And you? "Do you love me?" "I may always love you." "Life is short." "Especially when shared." "I must tell you..." "Quick, you'll miss your bus." "I'm listening." Gérard... Gérard... You're cheating. We were just playing. Forgive me. Aren't they shameless? They're carefree. - The world belongs to lovers. - And love is omnipresent. - You found them? - Yes on a woman's hands. A drink? No? Okay, come on. Monelle looks tired. She'd rather be with her boyfriend. I don't have one! Pardon? Sorry, I thought it was Ludo. You mustn't speak to me like that either. I'm talking nonsense. - Good night. - What's wrong? - Ludo, go with her. - Shall I? On you go.- Good night. - Be a gentleman. - Of course. - Such a funny girl. - A child. Not to be toyed with. Let's go. - Why say that? - Just a thought. - You know, Monelle... - I know. - You don't really think it? - No, my dear fool. I can't imagine you doing that. At her age, I was in love with the ginger postman. He married a tall blonde. My first heartbreak. I can't blame Monelle, I know what it's like to love you. - You're her postman. - Don't be silly! I hurt like her but it didn't last long. - You hurt? - Of course. - I'm not a rock. - And why? You loved me too much. I thought it too good to be true. And look at us now, just like the day we met. It's marvelous. I love you without realizing. Love is a reckless verb, one for women. You should be nice to her. She's fragile. I'm here, so you don't love her. Why say that? If you loved her, truly loved her, - I'd disappear. - Are you mad? I've always lived to make you happy. If you could be happy without me... I'd spirit away. I often think of it. Since we've known Monelle? No, since always. - Aren't you happy? - Worry is part of that. The happier, the more... Perhaps not desperate, but... We need to suffer to appreciate happiness. What do you mean "spirit away"? I live for you. You love me, so I exist. I'll stop seeing Monelle. You fear her. Do you love her? - Nonsense. - Do you long her absence? Not at all, I simply think it's better not to see her for a while. - It's best for her. - Or you? In two months, she'll forget. What's this look? It's intimidating. Isn't life funny? I may not have loved you with a different face. Yet it isn't the best face. I should have chosen a less fancy one. Fancy? My God. Could you be later? - I had a meeting. - With Favier? It's my life. Why try so hard? It's an open secret. - Was the Galerie Charpentier good? - Very. - Does Favier appreciate art? - Of course. - To him music is an ephemeral painting. - Liar! I was at the gallery and you weren't. - I stayed four hours. - You spy. - I'm curious. - I knew it. That's why we changed location. Who are you really courting? No answer? Do you really want to know? Favier is divorcing. Goodbye. _ I Say. ' Yes? Has Gérard spoken to you? No. He doesn't seem worrisome, depressed? He seems in top form. You know he hasn't composed in two months? - If he wants to rest... - No, he's working. It's all very well drinking coffee like an addict. He may be tired. He had a busy year. The concerts, his ballet... his book on Ravel. And he exhausted himself like a fool with conferences. Can you believe it! Conferences. It's good for him. Two sugars? Who? - In your tea? - Just one. Did you see my latest purchase? I think it's a Corot. But, I'm not convinced. Evaluate it. No, then I won't believe it's a Corot. Maybe not, but it's a good pretext for changing the conversation. What conversation? About whom? Monelle. We weren't. It's always about her. Gérard doesn't care about her. Maybe so. He hasn't seen her in two months. So he's missed her. If you see a psychoanalyst, he'll soon get rid of your Monelle complex. Look at me. I'm no luxury item nor a decorative one, I belong to the category of practicalities, you see? Vague“! - I know he needs me, I have this pride, or ridicule, in justifying my presence. But I'm useless to Gérard now. - He only has eyes for you! - No, my dear friend. When he did, he lived joyfully, without this obsession that he cannot yet name. I know it's called Monelle. And she is delightful. He'll be upset to realise he doesn't love me. I've done my time, with no regrets. I made Gérard very happy in that time. But I can still do one thing. I can make him happy without me, thanks to me. He has to see her. Of course. His cold was almost over and you're exposing him to it again. Is that funny? And you'll tell him to do it. He listens to you. Tell him he doesn't need to feel remorse for me as I won't. He's at a point in his career where he needs reinventing. - A change of scenery. - No. Not that and not me. I love both of you, and won't separate you. You're both part of me, like me eyes or hands. I'd be left crippled if one of you left me. Could you see me telling those who asked: "I lost Sylvia in an accident of friendship"? No, no, no and no! It's not a favour I'll do. You'd regret it. Coward. I'm brave enough to refuse for I'm lucid. Gérard is tired, but not of you. He doesn't need Monelle, he needs peace and concern, and your daily smile. I hope that's true. Let him see Monelle and if the sorrow he's seen for two months persists, then I'm wrong and will be assured. Won't you help me? So be it, as you wish. And should he be Monelised, - you, your life? - Mine? Then I, too, shall have a change of scenery. L say, it's lovely, very much so, it may well be a Corot. Why, hello, you. - What time is it? - Midnight, or so. - And Ludo? - Yes. - What was his news? - Nothing. - Did you eat together? - No, my love, I was alone. - And after? - I walked around Paris. - Alone? - Alone. And guess who I came across by chance? - Someone I hadn't seen in... - A long time? - In two months. - Who? Myself. - Good. - I found, recognised, saw myself, yet I'd lost all hope. I can admit it, I thought I was done. I waited for inspiration here as if it was a home-delivery service. I preluded, sniffed around, looked for leads, but nothing. I was in a desert. It was all very well trying but I had nothing. It's an unpleasant feeling. I know. Did you know? - I was also suffering. - Why didn't you say? But now, you feel much better? If you do. I, for the first time, - in... - A long time? Yes, for the first time, I once again felt... not alive, a stupid word, but... illuminated. I'm better, as are you. Now, let me surprise you. - Surprise me? - The song. The one I couldn't write in 19 years, I finally found in the street. Its definitive version. I can hear it without playing... It's of course a waltz. Without lyrics, it's so new. Marvelous, no? Yes, it's... it's marvelous. But your tone? Aren't you happy? I'm moved. A waltz at this time of night? After 19 years... I'm surprised. Listen... Let me find it... I only have the chorus, I'll ask Ludo for the verses. There we go. A true waltz, isn't it? The world belongs to lovers... Your waltz! Yes, you've given me everything. It truly is beautiful. "The world belongs to lovers," did you think of that? No, you did, one day. - Me? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Only we understand this air. Many sleep without dreaming. They don't yet know one day they'll sing this. When they are especially happy. Like me, tonight. Like you... Let me ask you... - All right. - A real sacrifice. Let me have this waltz, just me. I've waited so long for it. Could you? - Just for you? - Yes, our secret. It's yours. No one but you will know of it. - No one. - What is it called? The Waltz of Sylvia. Listen to my lettrist poem. - Lettrist? - I'll explain. In short, reduce to the letter and eliminate semantics. Use letters, define the undefined and out with the dictionary. Calm down... "For a giraffe... "A madrigal "shaped as a water jet. "Klikli, kli klakla, klouf, "Taon, taon, malapecs, "Zouzou zou, klef, klaf, "Vroum, yeu, yeu, yeu, "Plouf, dieu, dieu, dieu, "Z, Z, Z-ll What do you think? I'd like a copy. The radio invited me. - Imagine. - Really? Isn't it radio-material? Well... I'm not a very good judge. - Going somewhere? - Yes. To try my luck. Is that rebus? You're very mysterious since meeting with Favier. Poul la re somme poum net cohet cu kl... Understand? What do you want? The truth. The truth? It may hurt. That's a good answer. Had I known, I wouldn't be here. Do you often see Gérard? Each time he wishes. Yes... May I speak to you like an adult? I am an adult! I'm not your age, but... One day. I'm not your enemy. Now, I'm not here to fight. Do you believe me? Yes, perhaps. If only I were sure Gérard was happy. Look, since we're both here, let's be honest, I'm not angry at you. Thank you. I could be. It's your fault I haven't seen him. Mine? I'm not mad. If I were you... I'd have done so, too. As soon as I met you, I found you kind and friendly. Gérard, I admired him even before we met. And once we had... Go on, please. Even when that article appeared, I loved Gérard. Yet, I was unaware. I was ashamed when I saw it because of you. Yet no one around me seemed surprised or shocked, quite the contrary, I was overwhelmed. And I thought, "Anything is possible". I realised Gérard loved me. He told you? When you met thanks to Ludo, - did you eat together? - Without Ludo. We did nothing wrong. And we went for a walk. We walked and ended up on a bench. We sat in silence before leaving. He placed his hand on my shoulder and he sang to me. He softly sang a waltz. His very own creation. He was overcome with elation. Waltz? Inspired by a phrase I'd once uttered. - The world... - Belongs to lovers. I needed to hear that. - Please, let me. - No, no, today, - it's my treat. - You are kind. Papers, papers... - Papers. - No, thank you. Papers... Papers... The world belongs to lovers Hello? It's you. I just called you, of course, you were on the line. To whom? I'm not jealous, just curious. You don't have to answer, fool. You know all my secrets. What are you doing tonight? Shall we eat together? What a shame. I have big news for you. Guess? You're not even close. It's excellent news. It's money. I was worried about the end of the month. My account is empty. Today, there was a miracle. You don't say. And another thing, I will be leaving Paris for a while. Yes, you're coming. Friday morning, in the snow: Val d'lsére. It'll be wonderful. What do you think? With whom? What a question! With Sylvia! A reminder of our honeymoon. I could never leave without her! I'm glad to hear it. Monelle? Finished? It came without warning, then simply went away. Like a flu. That's what comes from reading bad journalism! It has a terrible influence on the feeble-minded. That's what I told Monelle. Poor Monelle... Very talented but between us, she's a real cow. Let's say she was indiscriminate. It's her age. Well you had a narrow escape. L did? Why? Why? Just a moment, please. From Mrs Favier. - Mrs Favier? - She wanted it delivered at 7pm. Yes, she insisted. No need, her tip was generous. These are my wishes. I have no regrets. Goodbye, dear friend, Sylvia. Hello? Ludo? Ludo? Ludo, what is it? Ludo? Ludo, answer me. What's wrong? Boss? Don't bother, he'll soon show. Anyone there? I'm here! What can I get you, sir? A birlou. Gérard? Anything... the same. Terrific. The wife and I were talking about you this morning. Would you believe it! Are you well? Better, thank you, you? In winter, it's rather quiet. I can't complain. By the way, I have something of yours. And I took care of it. Yes, the clock. I'm puzzled. It stopped the day you came. It gives 1.25 pm and that's all. Do you recognise this? The scarf your wife forgot. We had a real good time that day! Is she well, your wife? Yes, thank you. As cunning as ever? As ever. That's a woman who enjoys life. Send her my best regards. You have my word. And for the music, still together? - Still. - Glad to hear it! Fifty francs, sir. Thank you. - Well, goodbye. Until the next time. - Goodbye, sir. Cigarette. Lighter? In the pocket. Have you seen it? Shall I explain? - The money you gave to the kid. - Yes? That very evening, he got blind drunk and bought a lottery ticket. And he won 200,000. Can you believe it? And he set up shop in the woods. You can be proud of the luck you bring. Yes, I'm an extraordinary man. - You should have told him the truth. - No. Sylvia is still alive in his mind. It's good that she lives on somewhere. Even if it is in a fool's memory.
