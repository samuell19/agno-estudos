We have six men that were found last night, in bed... shot and killed. In 1965, Ronald DeFeo moved his family from Brooklyn into a beautiful three-storey home in Amityville, Long Island. Envisioning a better life for themselves, they even put a sign in front of the house saying: "High Hopes". Then things went terribly wrong. Rumors have been circulating that there is something dark and evil about the house. That the house somehow drove Ronny DeFeo to commit this grisly act. ♪ Ain't it good? ♪ ♪ Ain't it right? ♪ ♪ That you are with me, ♪ ♪ Here tonight? ♪ ♪ The music playing, ♪ ♪ Our bodies swaying in time. ♪ ♪ In time, in time, in time. ♪ ♪ Touching you, ♪ ♪ So warm and tender... ♪ ♪ Lord, I feel such a sweet surrender. ♪ ♪ Beautiful is the dream ♪ ♪ that makes you mine. ♪ ♪ Rock me gently... ♪ ♪ Rock me slowly... ♪ ♪ Take it easy, ♪ ♪ Don't you know? ♪ OK! We're home! Larry, old sicky bastard. How did you even get in here? Juliet? Are you up here? Hello? Joan! Hey! Hi, you guys made it! How was the ride? We're worn out. You know what? We're doing good. I need to go back in town. Thank you so much for helping with all of... What are sisters for? Have you told them... about...? No? I just want us to get settled in first, OK? OK. Well, I have everything set up the way you wanted if you wanna check it out. I set up an emergency back-up battery just in case. You never know with these old houses. And... You know we're only five minutes on the road, so you say the word if you need anything. - We'll be there. - Thank you. We've pretty much gotten to a routine now, so... I'm glad you're here. Everything's gonna be fine. What did doctor Milton say? The same as usual, you know... We're not gonna give up fighting. Of course. All right, everybody! Dig in! Aren't we gonna say grace? You hate saying grace. Never stopped you before. Well, maybe I'm embracing a change. I'll do it! "Dear Lord, thank you for this food". "And for this house". "And for keeping James safe and happy". "Amen". Juls, how do you like your room? Awesome! It's got pink, purple, silver and gold. All my favourite colors. Do you have all your paperwork done for tomorrow? Yup. Things do look good. Yeah, it looks great. Besides the fact that I have to move to a completely new school and start all over again on my senior year... We all have to make sacrifices. Quiet, boy! And what part of sacrifice does this house fit into? It's - It's three times as big as our last one. I told you. We got a deal. Save a few bucks? That's good to know. We moved here to be close to my family, to Candice. St. Alcuin has the best neurological department in New York. I want you to trust me, all right? This house is gonna be good for James. And that's all that matters. Right now, yes, that's all that matters. We all need to rally round and that's the only way he's gonna get through this. Get through what, Mom? I know James, OK? I know him better than you do. He's my twin! I can feel it! He's not there! - And whose fault is that? - James is gone, Mom! That's enough! Belle? Larry, come on! Yeah. You still love me, don't you, Larry? Even if you are stuck with that dumb name. Come on. I miss talking to you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Let's go, people! OK, guys, this is Belle. She just transferred here. Have a seat and take notes. We left off yesterday page 38. 1862. The Civil War. Battlefield medicine. Clara Barton. Check out the lipstick on freaky girl. She ended up starting the American Red Cross. What she did was, she talked mothers and daughters to come out to the battlefield and take care of their sons... brothers. It's not you. It's the house. What house? Yeah, 112 Ocean Avenue. Who are you? Some kind of stalker? What? No! How do you know where I live? - Everyone knows where you... - Please, just... Hey, hey, hey! It's your first day. You might wanna listen. ♪ Where were you when the sun came down? ♪ ♪ Chasing love on the fountain grounds? ♪ ♪ Where were you when the sun came...? ♪ My God! Juliet, you can't just... sneak up on people like that. Sorry. What are you doing up? I just wanted to talk to James. Doesn't James talk to you, Belle? In a way, I guess. Does he use bad words? Why would you say that? OK, party animal. It's sleepy-time. Come here. Tooty-hoi, yes, come on. - Belle? - Yes? How come Mommy doesn't love you anymore? Who told you that? Go to bed. Go back to bed, girls. You heard Mom, let's go back to bed. James? It's his heart. Sweetheart, stay with us, OK? Belle is here, Mom is here... Good. All right, sweetheart. You're doing great. Who's my brave boy? It's gonna be OK. All right baby. Now, OK, sweetie. Baby? I don't understand. What's happening? Come on! It goes too fast. Come on! Come on, don't do this. Come on, baby! Shit! Come on, come on, come on. Come on, honey. Come on! Stay with me, James. James... - Come on! - Mom. - It's over. - That's what you want, isn't it? It's what God would want. Honey. We're never gonna stop fighting for you. I'm so proud of you. Come, sweetie. Do you wanna give him a kiss? I knew you'd come back. Juliet? Who fixed you breakfast? - Shit! - Language, honey. D'you want some Granola? - Take care of yourself. Take it easy - Oh, really? Brenda, Leonie's looking for you! OK? In 1965, Ronald DeFeo moved his family from Brooklyn into a beautiful three-storey home in Amityville, Long Island. Then things went terribly wrong. Are you still questioning Ronald DeFeo? No comment. Where is Mister DeFeo? What kind of a guy is Ron DeFeo? Don't worry, I'm just stalking you. Yeah, erm, sorry about yesterday. He didn't look for trouble. And he was a happy fella. You know, you're not the first girl to mistake my basic human decency for perviness. You really didn't know? No idea. Man, I can't believe no one told you about that! Sick shit, right? Voices told him to do it. Took out the whole family, six people. Wait, where are you going? Well, I already missed the last three periods and I don't really wanna transfer again. Hey, wait, you ever see this? Do you recognize that house? We need to talk. Good to see you, honey. How was school? Why didn't you tell me about the house? I'm just waiting for the right time. And when would that be? You know it's just a ghost story, sweetie. It's an urban legend. Yeah, that everyone at my school seems to know about. You're right. I'm sorry. I should have told you. I just - I've really had a lot on my mind. Well, it would be nice if Juliet and I could be on your mind too. That's it. It's the doctor. Good talk! But it's an improvement, right? I mean, it has to be! I know it may seem that way. But remember, the last time we checked, there was no brain activity at all. But he opened his eyes! I mean, who's to say that he won't start speaking, or... - Even sitting up or something? - Joan. You know there no documented cases of anyone with James' injuries ever recovering. Then James will be the first. Is there any way to be sure if there's any recovery? It's highly unlikely. But I suppose we'll get to another fMRI. Great! How much more shit do you wanna put him through? Just leave him alone! Hasn't he suffered enough? Sorry about that. Didi likes to chase the ducks at the park. - We ended to telling them... - Are you talking to James again? Yeah. What does James have to say this time? He says he misses talking to you too. Hey, guys. Hey, Juls, your Mom's gonna walk Larry. D'you wanna go with her? OK! Come here, one, two, three, oooh, yeah. Huh, Belle, you know I don't want any more tests either. Then why did you suggest it? Because this test is gonna show your Mom what you and I already know. Did you know about the house? Please, just go. Juliet! You can't keep doing this. Scroll over. ♪ Happy Monday! ♪ Belle, this is Marissa. She's my girlfriend. You wish! M, this is my friend Belle. You wish! Wow! All kinds of love for Terrence today. See how it is? See you later, man! These guys... So, yeah... Marissa didn't believe me when I said I knew you so I thought you guys should meet. What's up? God, I would kill my Mom if she does something like that without telling me. Yeah, all talk is early and big at my house, so... Yeah, well, thank God none of this Amityville shit is real. Whoa, whoa! That all depends on your definition of real. You know, when someone's talking a lot about something, your mind starts playing tricks on you, makes you think it's real. According to whom? Science! Well, I'm really over this Amityville stuff anyway. My family's got enough demons to deal with, I don't need fictional ones too. I don't know, maybe that's exactly what you need. Hey, we should watch the movie. No, thanks. Come one, that's what horror movies are about, like escaping reality with your friends for a little while. It's fun. OK, it's fine. Let's watch it at your house. No. Your house. Come on! How often do you get to watch the Amityville Horror at the actual Amityville house? OK, sure. Awesome! We have to watch it at 3.15 AM though. Why? Cos that's when Ronny DeFeo murdered his family. And that's when the house comes alive. Juliet. Shit! Larry. What? What? Come on, you see something? What do you see? What do you see? That was great. Go, Larry. - Man. - Look, I told him not to do that. You should have seen her face. You guys seriously have to be quiet. We don't wanna wake up my Mom. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Wow! This place is amazing. Is that a binding circle in the backyard? A bounding circle? Yeah, like hundreds of years ago, like colonial times, there used to be all this weirdo cult shit going on around here, so... If they found an area was evil, they would do a ring around with like salt or fire, whatever... to try to keep the evil contained. Yeah, or maybe the gardener just got a little carried away with the weed killer. All right! So, I thought we were here to watch a movie. Yes. Yeah, I've seen the movie a dozen times... Shut up! I've never been inside the actual house. OK, I'm going to punch you in the actual mouth if you don't shut up. Yeah? Is that a threat or a promise? What's in there? Nothing. Let's go. OK, so... You got the original 1979 film starring James... Psssst! Starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder, erm... But just in case, I brought Amityville II... which is technically a prequel, so, I don't know if you like that. All right. Erm, then, of course, there's the remake... - No. - Yeah, right. - Remakes totally blow. Agreed! All right! The original it is. So, how would you girls like to be the bread in a Terrence sandwich? In your dreams! This house is built on special ground. Satan worship, demons. You cannot destroy this evil. It will always find a place to dwell. Something or someone to latch on to. What's going on? Have you all gone mad?? George! Come and go through here. Find the well. The passage to hell! What? Holy shit! It's 3.15 on the dot. - No, it's not. - I swear, look. - What did you do? - What? Nothing. I really hope not. I gotta get the lights back on. It's probably just a fuse. Right? No, we need to fix it or else I'm gonna have to wake up my Mom. OK, then, where's the fuse box? I think it's under the stairs. Great. The basement of the Amityville house, that's perfect. Haven't been down there yet. Hold on, I got this. Who wants to go first? God! What's that smell? Just try and find the fuse box. Wow! What? Under the stairs. It's where they discovered the red room. Whatever is in there, gets inside your head. Wouldn't find much in your head. They say this house makes you see things. Infects your dreams until you can't tell what's real and what's nightmare. And then, boom! Blood splatter and brain matter everywhere. Can we please just find the fuse box so we can get out of here? Hey, I think I found it. My phone is dead. What the hell are you doing down here? I could have killed you. We'll - We'll let ourselves out. Very nice meeting you. Since when do you carry a shotgun? Jesus! It was your father's for protection. I really don't think I need protection from my friends but thanks. You're not allowed to have friends over without asking me. You know how easy it is for James to get sick? What are you talking about? They weren't anywhere near him. Someone was in his room. The door was open when I came over but I shut it. Then who took his blanket off? He's not some sideshow attraction. Go to bed. It's possible that he has something called LIS. Locked-in syndrome. - Does that mean he's conscious? - I don't know. That means he may have a sort of consciousness, but it's locked into an inactive body. So, he is getting better. Well, looking at this fMRI scan and... seeing the return of some limited eye mobility, it would appear so. And this thing will tell us for sure? The EEG machine measures brainwaves, the more activity on this monitor, the stronger the emotional response. You're ready to give a try? All right. Step into his line of sight. Hi, Jimmy. Hey. Jimmy. That's a definite response. Candice. Belle, come closer. Mom? Are you OK? Your brother's back. Your brother's back. It's just a fly, James, don't worry about that. What's going on? I'm sorry, I... I can't - I can't really explain it but I... I don't think I can do anymore for you. Doctor Milton? Come on, Jimmy. You're doing great. You're doing so great. I love you so much. Come on, let's try to move that thumb up. Do you want me to rub your feet? You can blink once for "yes". That's OK. That's OK. Once it first happened, Belle said: "Jimmy will never give up". OK. Out, out! Go, now! Hey, hey, hey! Out, Larry! Bad dog! Don't worry, I'll never let him hurt you. I love you more than anything in the world. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** James? Is that you? What do you want? Come here! Where are you? James? Juliet? Juls, where are you? Hey, sis! - Start with "yes" or "no" questions. - OK. - Doctor Milton said that would be easiest for him. - OK. Jimmy? Sweetie? Do you recognize me? Belle? James wants to talk to Didi. Will you help me find him? Belle? Come say hi to your brother. He's talking to us through the computer. It's amazing. Come see! It's called an AAC. He can use his eyes to choose letters so he can communicate. You can talk to your brother again. What do you wanna say to him? I don't know. Just talk to him slowly. Is that really you in there? Wow, it's so cool! I miss you. He misses me too. I just never really told anybody about this. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. No, erm... I should. I really think I need to. I- I was having a lot of problems... with my family and with school... In and out of a lot of different programs. And I just started doing stupid shit. I sent these pictures to some guy... And then when I woke up the next morning, they were all over the internet. They were everywhere, everyone had seen them. Everyone at school and my Mom... And my brother... So, what happened? James wanted to find the guy who did it, and he lived in a three-storey apartment building... There was a really big fight and... He went over the balcony. Look, you didn't do anything wrong. You know that, right? You know, I - I really wanna believe that. And I keep telling myself... it was his choice. He would do it again in a heartbeat. I know he would. Because... That's just who he was. That was who he is. Belle, he's still alive, you've just talked to him. You're reading the wrong book. You know it. Only saying, is it a little weird that your brother is in a comma for two years, and the minute you move into this new house, he miraculously gets better? I don't - I don't know. Unless, of course, it's not really him anymore. What are you talking about? He's talking about a possession. In 1974, the house drives Ronny DeFeo to kill his whole family. A year later, it nearly drives the next family to do the exact same thing. And they blamed it on the red room, that they discovered right there. In the basement. See? It's right under your brother's bed. So, you're saying... this evil thing latched onto my brother? OK, whoa, whoa, whoa, look, I hate to bring everyone back down to Earth, but... Other families have lived in that house, nothing scary has happened there for 40 years. 40 years, that's a very significant number in the Bible. "And the land had peace 40 years". So, maybe the evil only latches on every 40 years. - No, that's stupid. - Dude, seriously? The Bible? Belle, you're not actually buying this shit, are you? Well, you said he can talk now, right? So, why don't you just ask him yourself? Yeah, what's the worst that could happen? I need to ask you a question. Are you OK with that? Is someone else... in there with you? What can I do to stop it? How can I help you? No! No, I can't do that. No! I love you so much. Are you sure you want to do this? I'm gonna take this out. You're the one who's gonna fucking die! Is he all right? Are you OK, honey? What's going on? Jimmy, are you OK? - What did you do? - I... What did you do? You've no right to do this! He's breathing. He's breathing on his own! Jimmy wants to live. He deserves to live. Get out. If you touch him again, I swear... It's bad enough that he's trapped in his own body and now he's... What? He's... There's something in there with him? What am I gonna do? I... I have to help him! Look, Belle, you have to help your entire family, OK? I mean, whatever is in there with James, if it wins, you know, if it takes over completely, it will kill everyone. Belle, you gotta get your family out of there. Or we have to prove it to your Mom somehow. Find a way to show her that your brother is being controlled by whatever is in that house. Belle? Why aren't you at school? I wasn't feeling well. I'm sorry. I'm sure I'll be fine. No, I'm sorry about last night. For what? If you hadn't pulled Jimmy out of the respirator... We wouldn't know that he could breathe on his own. I know you were doing what you thought was right. But now you know how wrong it is. Right? Jimmy was always going to come back. You do want us to be a family again, do you, Belle? Of course. Good. Get some rest, sweetie. I love you. Hey, James, how you doing today? Outside walk. Those are your biggest words yet. You're doing so great! Yes, we can! - Honey! Be careful by the water, OK? - OK! I don't know why it's so hard for everyone to believe he's getting better. Well, he's getting better but don't you wanna know why? Is it...? I think a second opinion would be good too. We can do that. A second opinion is OK. Did you ask doctor Milton about this? I haven't been in contact with him yet. Juliet! What happened? You're OK? Come here, baby, come on! What's wrong? You tell me, what's wrong? It's Larry. Don't look at him. Is that a binding circle out the back? A bounding circle? If they found an area was evil, they would do a ring around with like salt or fire... to try to keep the evil contained. It's gonna be OK. OK. All right. That's great. Thank you. So, the vet can be here first thing tomorrow morning to pick up the body. Thank you for doing this. Thanks for everything. Of course! Joan! - Don't worry about it. - I know. - And Juliet is gonna be OK. - I know. How about I come by and check on everybody after my shift tonight? - Is that all right? - Yeah, it sounds great. OK. It can't leave the house. Hey, Mom, I need to talk to you. Mom! Stop! Are you listening to me? Look, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy, OK? But I... I got a really bad feeling about this house. I think it's doing something to James, it's - it's... It's like possessing him or infecting him, I... I don't know. There's this room in the basement, OK? I've been down there, I've seen it myself. I swear, I think that's what's making him all of a sudden better. Please, say something. I don't think you're crazy, sweetheart. I know about the red room. Come here. Wait... what did you just say? You know I always believed in God. And then your father got sick. We had to watch him rot away from the inside from cancer. Everyday I prayed. And then James got sick. And still I prayed. Two years. The doctors had given up on him, right? They said he'd never come back. I won't accept that. What are you talking about? God gave up on us, sweetheart. So, I gave up on God. And I moved us here. Because if... if there is some power... that can make your brother better... Better? No, Mom, you don't understand. This isn't better. This house is evil, this house is really bad. It's gonna drive James to kill our own family, just like the DeFeo's... You, me, Juliet... Stop, stop, come here. No, no, no... James would never do that, OK? He would never do that. He's getting better. Honey, come here. - Belle? - Get up! - I need you to put this on, OK? I want you to hurry and stay quiet. OK? Where are we going? I'll be right back. Shhh! ♪ Ain't it good? ♪ ♪ Ain't it right? ♪ ♪ That you are with me here tonight? ♪ ♪ The music playing, ♪ Hi, honey! Come, sit down, we're just about to start dinner. Hey, guess what, Belle? Chicken smells great, Mom... Hey, Belle! How did you sleep? I hope you're hungry. Mom made all this great food. Juliet, pass the chicken, please. Hey, this looks great! Where's your bed? In his room. It's about time we had a proper dining-room. Jimmy. Of course. Dad would be so happy to see us all here together. - Don't you think, Mom? - Yes, I do. Fuck! Candice? Candice! Don't come in! No, please! Joan? Joan? Are you awake? Belle? Belle? Belle? Juliet? Belle? Can't get out of my room! Belle! Belle, I can't get out of my room! - Juliet? - Belle! - Pshh! Be quiet! - Tell me what's going on! Belle? What's wrong with Mommy? Belle? Juliet? Hi, Mom. Hi, baby. What are you doing with that? Don't you recognize me, baby? God, no. God has nothing to do with this! Damn you to hell! Too late. - I left Didi standing... - Shhhh...! Where are you going? Is that Larry? No, baby. I want you to go in the next door neighbor's house and wait for me, OK? There you are, sweetie. James? I'm scared. Shhhh! Don't be scared. Didi. We'll play a little game, OK? OK, Juls. I don't want to. Turn over and go to sleep. Do it! Stop! Don't hurt her. - You wouldn't hurt your brother, would you? - You're not my brother. My brother died two years ago and you know it. Because of what you did! Belle! It hurts so bad. I c-can't move. T-t-that wasn't me, Bell. You have to believe me. I swear! Please! Help me. I miss you! Please! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry about everything. I love you. Help me. Take me back inside. It's - It's what Mom would have wanted. You don't wanna disappoint her, do you? Mom is dead, so is Juliet. All we have is each other now. Liar! You're not James. You're a liar! No! You're not James! I don't wanna die! It's me! No! Why? No! No! No! No! No! Please! Hey. Thank you. Belle? - Belle? - Juliet? Belle! Juliet? My God! Baby! Hey, let me see you, are you all right? Are you hurt? What happened to James? He was gonna hurt us, baby. But he's in a - he's in better place now. I promise. OK, now, listen to me, Juliet, the police are gonna be here really soon. I'm gonna tell them exactly what happened. But I need you to do the same, OK? James tried to hurt us and I need you Te tell them that. Right, baby? - Yes. - Yeah? Do you think they'll believe us? Tragedy has struck once again at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island. The infamous house where Ronny DeFeo killed his entire family with a shotgun. More than four decades ago. Police are questioning 17-year old Belle Walker as a person of interest in the brutal murders of her aunt Candice, her mother Joan and the death of her brother James. Miss Walker claims that her brother committed the crimes, and her story is being corroborated by her seven-year old sister, Juliet. A spokesman for the Amityville Police Department said that forensic evidence does point to James as the killer. His fingerprints were found on the murder weapon. But doctor Ken Milton refutes that claim, stating that James Walker was too weak to get out of bed. Let alone stalk his entire family with a shotgun. But two years prior to the murders, James was in a comma, a vegetative state. Is this house a source of evil, as legend suggests? Did it awaken and possess James Walker or his sister Belle? For now the police are left with a horrific unsolved crime. And Amityville, Long Island, is once again, the center of shock and horror.
