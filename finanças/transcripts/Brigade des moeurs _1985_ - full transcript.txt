This film is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to people living or dead is purely coincidence. Wanna come, baby? Do you want me to take you with me? I'll take you! Come on! THE VICE SQUAD Are you here to make love? Oh, yeah? Why don't you fuck off then? Go home, asshole! Oh, it's those fuckers again! Tell me, Robert! Are you a trucker by day? Is that true? Do you take your tits off when you go to sleep? Get out of the way! Is this a war? I don't know if it's a war, but it looks like what's left of one. Well, besides this, is everything alright? Well, besides this it's ok. Pierre Valeron... Gerard Latuada... A veteran of Criminal Investigations, now he's working in Vice. - Hi. - Hi. Do you recognize them? Yes, I recognize Dolores. How did you know she was working for me? Here's the letter you sent her. A year ago. It's been a long time since I talked to her. And the other two? I don't know them. How did this happen? They busted them while they were hiding in the woods. According to a john that escaped the massacre through some miracle. Any signs from the killers? Four guys in black, riding black bikes. Try to do something with that. - Did they use shotguns? - Most likely. Just look at the wounds. And just a few days from your retirement. They screwed you! You mean they screwed us. What do you mean, "us"? It's your snitch, isn't it? Besides you're in Vice, and I have your boss's blessing, of course. - Well, that's a stiff! - You don't say? Come. There's nothing else to be done here. I'm not into guys anyway. The contract was for Dolores. Just her. The Greek never asked you to depopulate the woods. Listen Luigi. Your job is to pay me. Give me the dough and stay out of anything else. At least you could've busted the john as well. I've got a proposition for the Greek. I'm listening. There's two guys blocked in Paris, with a big load of heroin. Their buyer went down last week. I don't see how this has anything to do with the Greek. I need 200 to pick up that load. If the Greek gives me an advance, he'll get a big part of it without getting his hands dirty. We'll take care of everything. Interesting... You're forgetting the Greek won't have anything to do with drugs. Talk to him anyway. Hey! Let's get this done fast. Today's a very busy day for me. Hi, Your Honor. You don't look very well today. Yeah, I'm very tired. Who got you like this? Solange or the Greek? Your sister has nothing to do with it. Let's go. Come on, you'll catch him eventually. He's smarter than you so it's gonna take a little longer, that's all. The Greek is going to be furious. The contract was for Dolores! But this maniac and his band of morons like to shoot anything that moves. Let's not be dramatic about this. It wasn't a bad idea after all. It'll keep the pigs from focusing on Dolores. While you're in Liege, don't forget to mention Costa's proposition. The Greek won't touch any dope. Do you speak for my husband now? I didn't mean that, but... No buts! Tell him about Costa's proposition. He'll decide on his own. Understood? As you wish, madam. Hello. I've come to see Peggy. - He's not here. - I'm not fooling around. Mr. Peggy doesn't want to be dist... You better stay like this until I come back. Got it? Good day, Inspector. How nice to see you! Wouldn't you rather get Aids? Huh, "artist"? What brings you here? Dolores. Oh, yes. She used to pose in your cultural center. Is there anything you can tell me? I wasn't her confidant, you know Inspector? Do you know who was behind this child porn shoot? Minors. That'll get you 2 to 5 years. Well, I heard Dolores ran into trouble with some hookers in a private party. It was in an apartment on the 16th. But I don't know the address. I swear, Inspector! Smile! It's for Vice. The whore that Dolores fucked up works for a guy called Luigi. A very dangerous guy. Luigi? What Luigi? The Greek's right hand man. You can go on now. At ease! You can get a smoke now. Veronica! Gerard! What a surprise! Get in! Monique! Watch my car, I'll be right back! It was necessary for Dolores to die so I could see you again... Life is foolish. Don't you think? Why do you say that? Because I was very much in love with you for a long time... knowing it would end up being nothing. And then, you show up today... and here we are, playing cops and whores. You want me to find out something about the party where Dolores got in trouble. And instead of telling you to fuck off, I say yes. You're the only person who knew Dolores that I can trust. If you refuse, I don't know what to do. Where can I reach you? This number. Apparently, you were pretty sure about my answer. Well, are you gonna give me a ride? And how's your son doing? Adorable. Not much like his father, luckily. Did you have any more problems with him? No. I don't even know if he's still alive. Anyway, he didn't try to take my son from me anymore. I guess you and Robert convinced him. And how's Robert? He's still out there. Yes, I'm listening. No, it's no bother Commissioner. Well, just a little bit... Yes. What? Where? Perfect. No, you did well. I'm coming. It was Mounier, the chief of the Vice Squad. I've got to go right away. It's very important. Mournier's boys found some porn magazines featuring children in a sex shop that belongs to Mother Alice. Besides, they found a prostitute in one of those private clubs. Who is Mother Alice? She's Dimitrios Sthephanopoulos' woman. The Greek. This time I have him! Sometimes I wish I was in that damn Greek's place. You spend more time caring about him than me. I wonder how you found the time to put a child in me. Would you say that again? I was going to tell you this weekend, but I couldn't hold it in. Do you have the stuff? Yeah, you can get high now. Thank you, Jimmy. I'm listening. I saw Samir Abdelkrim, the guy that deals over at Barbes. Yeah, I know him. So what? He was showing off in front of Sonia. I followed them in the train, but I couldn't keep up with them. You wouldn't be bluffing, would you? You pay me to follow your girls, right? Alright. Now piss off. Calm down, calm down. Shit. There's your little rat. Alright, pull over. What's going on, Jimmy? Stop it. You're hurting me! You're fucking for love now? - Wanna come with me, darling? - Fuck off, you cunt. What a scumbag! I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill that slime! Good evening. Wait for me, girls! Sorry, sir. This is a private club. He's coming with us. Thanks. Can I offer the lady a drink? With pleasure. Do you dance? - But... - Come on, it's work. I'm the owner of a packing company. Oh, I work with packages as well. Isn't it fun? It's time. Come on, one more. Work is work. Why don't you sit with us, sir? It'd be stupid to be alone. Let's go get a drink. Right away. Where are you sitting? - Over there. - Ok. We'll be waiting for you. - I'll be right back. - You promise? I promise. I don't think I know you. We'll have the chance to get to know each other in the right time. A pack of News, please. It's 20 francs. For that price, I hope it comes with a dance. How nice of you to come to see me. Police! Police! Don't close that safe! I want to get some air. You'll turn on all the lights when I say so, or I'll stab you with my heels. Police! Now! Come on! Police control! Keep calm. Keep calm. Come on, move. Monique, is everything alright? Yeah, everything's ok. Is she your colleague? Forget about her, she's not right for you. - Wanna come? - No. Come on, let's go. Let me go! Leave her alone. I warned you. She chooses her clients. Come with me. Pig. - Where are we going? - To the "Rock and Roll". I'm so wasted. This is gonna be fun! Hey, isn't that the guy you were looking for? Pull over. What are you gonna do, Jimmy? Shut up. Get off! Get off! Alright. Shit! Don't lose him. Samir... You're late. It was just a hold up. Nothing important, Inspector. Well, I'm listening. Shit! It's a set up! Worse for him. Run him over! Watch out! You got him! I'm gonna fuck you up! Hold it right there! Shit! Get going, for God's sake! Was there any celebrity in the lot? No, boss. Good, go then. Here it is. Sign here. This was a set up. I never had prostitutes in my properties. And the porn pictures with young girls? Maybe one of your friends took them. It wouldn't be the first time. And the 60 grand we found in your safe? My life savings. And the fake documents? Are they just to show off? Gerard, go help the others. As you wish, Jacques. Gerard, come here fast! What happened? Did you receive your pay? Letellier got shot. Shit! Look, it's the chick from last night. Aren't you questioning me, darling? If I hear you disrespecting her or trying to be funny I'm gonna leave your face looking like a parking meter. Let's go, Natalie. I need some fresh air. See that she doesn't talk to anybody. I want to speak with an Inspector. It's not a good time, they're very busy. What do you need? Are you an inspector? I am. Why? I know who shot your partner tonight. The Jimmy saw Samir and he went crazy! They dropped me and my friend off and went after him. That's all I know. Why are you telling this to us? Does this look like a good reason? I don't want to end up disfigured any given day. Ok, Sonia. You can cover up. Where does your guy go when he needs his dope? He deals it himself. - Is Jimmy his real name? - No. His name is Joseph Melinaud. And Rapha? I don't know his name. What kind of car does Rapha drive? Thanks. A grey BMW. But I don't know his plate number. Where can I find them? That might be hard. Perhaps at Baladi's place. A Lebanese that organizes parties. Do you know his address? No. He's into shemales. Did he bring in some of them recently? No, the shemales got banned. They got into trouble with one of Luigi's girls. Do you know Luigi? I never saw him. But Rapha and Jimmy know him. Alright. Could you put all this in writing? Is your partner crazy? Does he want me to get busted? What a surprise! Good evening. Am I interrupting something? Not at all. Wanna grab a bite, Inspector? - Do you want some Gin? - Sure. Are you gonna tell me the reason for your visit? I came to see if there was any news. Dolores got into trouble with one of Luigi's proteges. You know, the Greek's right hand. It was at a certain Baladi's place. Was it bad? Yes. She cut up the girl with a glass. I'd like you to get to know Mr. Baladi. If you get in, try to find a guy named Rapha or another one that goes by Jimmy. Is it related with Dolores? I don't know yet. But take care. They shot down a colleague tonight. - Cheers. - Cheers. Any news from Nadine? She had a bad week. She didn't show up. From the side of the aggressors, it's all foggy. The informer is so happy to be alive that he lost his memory. Shit! Francois, tell Nathalie to call a doctor! You come with me, Gerard. What happened? I was trying to get her to speak, and she suddenly reached for her heart and fell. The doctor's here. I'm gonna tell the boss. Can you leave me alone with her, please? As you wish. So, what happened? I don't know, she passed out. Tell the others! Quick! Stop! You're gonna fall! Shit! I pay you a lot to defend my interests. Bribe anybody you want, but make all the clubs open up. You idiot! You're the lawyer, not me! Fuck this! Alright, I'm listening. Madame Alice... your wife... Come on, talk! She's dead. What are you saying? She fell down trying to get away from the police. Prepare the car. We're going back to Paris. Call Costa. Tell him I'm interested in his proposition. He can reach me in Vesinet. But I thought you didn't want to deal with him. Luigi! Do you wanna argue with me? Ok. You're the boss. Come on. Let's go back. Was the stuff good? Yes, but there's other business to attend. When are you gonna record your album? At the end of the month, if everything goes as planned. Hey, Peeper! We're gonna have to make the house bigger. Did you get a raise? No, the family just got bigger. Is it a boy or a girl? Would somebody be kind enough to tell me who's expecting what? You're gonna be an uncle! So, Bruno, say something. Is it a boy or a girl? I don't know yet. What do you mean, you don't know? - And the compass? - What compass? Our compass. You didn't forget about it, did you? Of course not. Solange keeps it. It's just that it wasn't planned. You know what I mean? What are you guys talking about? If you want a boy, you have to make love heading north. And for a girl, heading south. That hasn't worked out with Sophie. Don't you think the compass is not the only thing that doesn't work right? Good morning, Marcel. Hello, René. A Martini, as always? Bye, Joseph... and I charge by the order. Yes, but the photo... Yes, the photo. But it's all the same anyway. It's very difficult... Do you have the merch? Perfect. If you wanna check... Ok. I'll tell him. Wait! I'll put him on the phone. Lautada, for you. Hello. When? Great! Wait, I'll write it down. So, what's going on? The papers are fake, but the caliber was real. Looks like the guys from the woods are still running around. Same bikes, same butchery. And the same kind of weapon. Alright, bye. Well, we might get out of this fog. Remember Veronica? Veronica? The prostitute from the Madeleine? Exactly. She just called. So? Turn that thing off! Oh, my god! I'm not gonna stay for long. Fix yourself a Martini while you're waiting. I'm almost ready. Almost? Do you like it? What's this? Don't be stupid! Did you get a new job? Where are you going with that outfit? With you. That's out of the question. But Gerard, it's gonna be fun... I said no, and no means no. Robert and his guys are over there. You're a real cheater. - Who's that? - His woman, so to speak. Tell the others. This is Sapphire. The artist is entering the scene. Over Emerald here. We're watching the scene. Over. I'm scared. Smile. You look beautiful. Gerard Latuada... and his lady, Sylvie. They're the friends I've talked you about. Allow me to introduce you to my friends. May I? Of course. Veronica will keep me company. Your girlfriend is always so charming. Yeah, charming and stubborn. She insisted on coming along. Do you still love her? Yes. I was lucky to get away from Baladi. I don't know how could I get you in. He was the one who introduced me to Rapha. Which one is he? He hasn't arrived yet, but he'll come. Don't worry. He really wants to catch me. He won't. We'll intervene before that happens. I'm gonna leave you. I have to play the housewife. I'll greet him when he arrives, so you know which one is him. Alright. We'll let it be for a while. We'll leave the merch and the dough here. We'll wait for things to go quiet, and then we'll see. - Ok, Rapha? - Ok. I gotta go. I have an appointment. Is it a good one? Veronica, do you know her? Monique's partner? - Exactly, so you do know her. - Yes, I do. If you leave me alone once more... I'm gonna go with the first one that comes along. Stop drinking, Sylvie. Hello, Rapha! I want to leave, Gerard. You wanted to come. I warned you. Now wait a little longer. Who's this chick? Leave her alone. She's a lesbian. Rapha came alone. 5'11". Brown hair. Wearing a tuxedo. Do you have his picture? We saw his BMW. Don't let him get away. Good night, little boy. Z2 calling Zenith. Copy Z2. Calling to inform that the D.A. is in the location of the murder of Solange Ricci, the Judge's wife. Received Z2. Dan, could you come here for a moment? Did you keep the contact info of the dealers? Not all of them. Just one or two. Why? Comissioner. My wife's keys were missing from her belongings. They had a chain with a little compass. Nothing of material worth, but emotionally invaluable. I'll take note of this, Your Honor. You never know. You're in great shape. Everything's ok, Robert? Did you come to practice? No, weapons were never a passion of mine. And it surely won't be now, so near my retirement, that I'll start feeling it. I want to talk to you. I'm listening. You know very well that your sister's murderers were involved in the affair with the transsexuals... and the carnage in the bar. You know where I'm going with this. Yes, I understand. I'll take a vacation. It will be good for me. It's for the best, Gerard. You're too involved. I'll keep you up to date. Bye, Robert. Good hunt! You might not be cute, Fat Louis but you're great in bed. You're very nice. Not like your friend. Leave her alone. There are many like her out there. I want to do her. Veronica is involved with a cop. If you screw with her it won't be pretty. I'm warning you. So she's just a stuck up bitch. Don't say that! She just fell in love with him. That's all. But that was a long time ago. A better reason to do her. Here. This is for you. You're so nice, Fat Louis. - Yes? - Rapha! It's Jimmy! What do you want? You shouldn't be calling me. I know, but Sonia disappeared. Have you seen her? No. I have better things to do than looking after your girls. Bye. Bad news? A horse that didn't make it. Do you know anything about Freddy? Yeah, he can't provide me right now. There's no dope in the market. Come to see me in a few days. I'll see what I can do. Thanks anyway. Gerard Yes. It's Dan. Your guy is in Abesses Alley. Where did you say? Abesses Alley, number 4. 4th floor, left. - Bye. - Bye. Gerard. Take care. Bye. Don't stop! I see you got it, Jimmy. What do you want? How many people have you fucked up by selling this shit? Why do you care? I don't. But you... you're gonna get an overdose. You're fucking nuts! Who sent you? The Greek? You're not in a position to make any questions, Jimmy. But you can save your ass if you answer mine. Get fucked! Alright. No! Fuck! Stop! Who sent you to kill Dolores? For the Greek. It was for the Greek! And the others too? Just the judge's wife and the trannies. The dope guys were Costa's idea to screw the Greek. And the girl that was with Samir? It was also the Greek? No, that was an accident. We didn't know she was a cop. Who did it? Who pulled the trigger? Rapha! It was Rapha! You hesitate again and you're dead. The name of the 4th guy... Fat Louis. Where do you keep the dope, the bikes and the rest of the stuff? It's a hangar. On the way out of a town called Sucy. Why the judge's wife? The Greek really felt the loss of his wife. And Costas told us that bitch was married to a judge. You son of a bitch! You're coming with me. Shit! Do you think it was one of the Greek's men? I can't see why would he throw him with his hands tied. A bullet would've been enough. - Who was it then? - Good question. What do we do now? We'll focus on Rapha. I don't want him to break Jimmy's record. He lives in a 6th floor. Do we have to protect that scum? Stop complaining! Here... What's new? Nothing. The same blonde that was here before with supplies. I hope he moves. My stomach is rumbling. Those are a real kick in the gut, huh? Did I do something wrong? Call for back up. No, please! No! Sapphire 12 to all units! There's only one entrance in the whole fucking building! Were you sleeping or what? He must've taken advantage of the garbage truck. That's an explanation, not an excuse! You were lucky after all. Well, say something! Melinaud and Lemoine found out about a certain Louis Lecas, aka Fat Louis. He owns a bar on St. Denis street and he has been seen with the other two killers. Ok, set up a stake out outside his place. If you lose him, you can prepare your solicitation for relocation because I will accept it! I'm gonna go get chewed out by the boss and I'll be right back. At least he didn't jump out his window. What did you say, Valeron? Nothing boss, you were right! A bullet would've been enough. I'm gonna send you to the archives, wise guy! Idiot. After screwing me, Costa is killing his own men. One by one. If he thinks he's gonna keep those 200 grand he can go fuck himself. Should I gather some men? No. I'm gonna take care of his well-being. Personally. It'll make me feel young again. Alright, but what do we do? We find him, we get back what's ours and then I'm gonna bust his balls. Jimmy... now Rapha... You think the Greek is fucking around? I didn't expect him to find us so soon. Where are you going, Louis? To get some. Stay here. You'll fuck some other day. I like strong thrills. I really want to do Monique's friend. If we're gonna fight the Greek and his poets I'd rather do business with Veronica first. Besides, she needs some cock. What did you say? Don't get mad! I'll go some other day. What was the name of the girl? Veronica. Why? It's the name of the girl Rapha was going to meet. Where can we find her? In The Opera. Why? Can't you say anything else? Take me there, Einstein! What is this? Do you wanna take a drink first? What's going on here? You won't say "hello" first? Get out of here! Both of you! You're crazy! Don't talk to me like that, you bitch! Now you're gonna crawl, slut! Pick her up. Now I'm gonna ask you a few questions. For every answer I don't like, I'm going to cut you. Understood? "Yes, sir". I'm still waiting! Yes, sir! See, Louis. She's obedient. You just need to know how to talk to her, that's all. Was it you who gave Rapha up to your policeman, scum? I don't know any cops. Take her skirt off. You don't like it when I touch you? Stop that or I'll strangle you! Who's this? Who's this! My son. Do you still not know any cops? Not that, please. Not that! I'm gonna rip your cunt off, bitch! Not that, I beg you! I know a cop. I beg you, don't do that. Why did you give Rapha to him? He was in charge of Dolores's case. His name. Gerard. Gerard what? Latuada! Where can we find him? He lives on the 15th. Alone? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. He often visits his girlfriend. So he has a girlfriend? Where can we find her? Answer me, or I'll tear your ovaries off! She works in a private clinic. In Lemoine, Paris. - What does she do there? - She's an anaesthetist. What's her name? Sylvie. Sylvie what? I don't know! I swear I don't! She's all fucked up now Kill her. No, I wanna keep her until she's well again. Do you want her to sic her cop on us? She won't do that, otherwise... Close up your bar, hide in the hangar and wait there for news. Alright. - Sir? - I'm one of you. The guys who did this are sick. Why do you say "guys"? I'm just going by the statement of that young girl. - Good evening, Inspector. - Good evening. Do you know them? One is Fat Louis. An animal, obssessed with asses. The other, Costa. I think he's a fag. Do you know where I can find them? Fat Louis at St. Denis bar. I don't know about the other one. I think he goes to a club for faggots "New York Avenue", in the St. Paul neighborhood. Alright. Do you have a light? I'm sure I had a lighter here! Monique, where did you get this? Fat Louis gave it to me. Why? I'm borrowing it. Get ready. We're just following him without further action, boys. Ok, boss. Let's go. CLOSED DUE TO BEREAVEMENT Don't move, Fat Louis! Do I know you? Let's say we have friends in common. Like who? Veronica... Dolores... Solange Ricci. What do you want? I'm here to deliver the bill you have to pay! Get ready! Police! You're surrounded! Hey, there's fire inside! They can't stay in for too long. Call the boys. It's not worth it, he's too far already. Are you crazy? What where you trying to do? Get a bullet in your head? I'm sure I hit him! Yeah, fine. Fine. Good evening, darling. Where did all that come from? Leather turns you on, that's why I'm wearing plenty of it. Did you hit your head or what? Thank you, my love. Can you get me a glass of water, please? But... are you hurt? I tried to leave the store without paying. Don't be stupid. Let me see that, Gerard. Is it bad, doctor? The bullet went in and out, but we're gonna have to take you to the hospital. No way, darling. You're healing me here. But Gerard, what's going on? Why don't you wanna go to the hospital? If I could go to the hospital, I would be there. Please, no questions right now. Don't move. I'll be right back. That smells good! - Are you expecting somebody? - No. Stay here, I'll get it. Good morning, Sylvie. I hope I'm not late. No, Robert. It's been a long time! Gerard is in the kitchen. It's Robert. Robert! What a surprise! How did you know I was here? A hunch, kid. An old cop's best friend. What brings you here? I needed somebody to talk to. I'll leave you two alone. I'm running late. I need to get ready. Thanks. Any problems? My career is ending with a very nasty affair. Besides, there's a guy out there who's taking out all known suspects. Last night he killed one of the last two right in front of our eyes. Well, it's not that bad. You got 3 of the 4 killers. That's not a bad ratio. Well, but I don't have them anymore It's a miracle none of my men died as well. Unless he feels some kind of sympathy for cops. The guys that worked with you were always very lucky. Remember when we were a team? I hope that luck didn't wear off for you. Leave it, I can do it myself. What are you gonna do now? Just wait. The mysterious vigilante knows more than we do. I'll just have to be content with counting the hits. Why do you call him a vigilante? A guy who enjoys killing criminals and avoids the cops and other people. What do you call that? Do you approve of that? Of course not! I can't approve of that! Although... I understand it. I'm a cop, don't forget that! I serve justice, not deliver it. Then you should catch him. We'd have to find him first. Since I'm retiring, it won't be my problem anymore. Well, I have to get going. Oh, I forgot! I found this near the body of a certain "Fat Louis". He was burnt to a crisp in a hangar last night. I don't know where it came from, but perhaps you can report it to Bruno. How can I give it to him without telling him where it comes from? That's your problem, kid. Leaving already, Robert? Yeah, I have a lot of work. I'll go with you, I'm leaving as well. Bye, Gerard. Bye... Robert! Yes? Thank you... for the visit. You're welcome, kid. The coffee was delicious, Sylvie. You should come by more often. When my son was killed while I was on duty, the Minister said "Pity, Mr. Capes, is the menace that looms over every cop". He then put a medal on top of my son's coffin He read a beautiful speech... the same as always... and then he left. Why are you telling me this, Robert? Because I think you're great, Sylvie. So, listen to me. Don't let yourself be ridden with doubt. Get close to everything you love. Don't worry, I know my way out. Bye, Robert. I didn't know he had lost his son. Yes, he was 10 years old. It was during a shootout. But he never talks about it. What did he want from you? He seemed strage when he left. He wanted to make sure I'm still lucky. I come to see the patient. I probably don't look very pretty. Don't be silly, you're beautiful. The doctor promised me you wouldn't get any scars. You can believe him, he's the best. Thank you for getting him. I owed it to you. Did you find those two monsters? Don't think about them. I swear they won't bother you anymore. One's dead. And the other one... What about a little trip with your son? Where would I go? The maniac that was with Fat Louis took everything I had. Here. Open it, it's for you. - For me? - Yes. What is it? A little something, so you can get your car fixed. But Gerard... there's a fortune in here! You deserve it. - Gerard... - Yes? Where did all this money come from? From hell. Get well. If that faggot isn't in here, we're screwed. Don't do anything. If he's not already here, he will arrive soon. Costa comes here almost every day. What are you drinking? I'll have a coke. Hello, Costa. Same as always? Hello, Gerard. Getting your hands dirty? I see they let the fairies out. Are you hurt? It's nothing, just a nasty fall. Hello, Latuada. What's up? What are you doing here? Nothing special, I was in the neighborhood. - Want a drink? - I have to go. Just one! We're about to leave as well. Alright, but only one. Then I leave. There he is! He's running like his ass is on fire! Let's get him! - I'll be right back. - Ok. Fuck! Shit! Good night, doctor. Tomorrow I'll be on duty again. Do exactly as I say or I'll blow your head off! Fuck, they're stopping. What do we do now? Pull over and wait. That faggot is clever enough to pull a trick on us. What do you want from me? I'm sure he's gonna hide somewhere. Come on. Let's go. Take off your shoes and socks. Come on. I don't wanna repeat myself! The sun will be up in an hour. If they don't get out of there, let me know. You're in great shape. Your cop probably has a nice cock. No, you're crazy! Let me go! Stop screaming, slut, or I'll cut your throat. Tell me your guy's number. We need to have a little talk. Yes? Hey, stud. Do you go to fag clubs now? You'd do well to, because soon you won't have a girlfriend anymore. Who's this? A man who wants to bust you like you did with the other three. Costa? In the flesh! I have a surprise for you. I'm listening. Congratulations, Mr. Pig, you have great taste. She's as pretty as your friend Veronica. But before I take care of her... I'm gonna work on your chick, just like I did with your whore. I'm gonna enjoy fucking her. I always dreamed of cutting a slut's throat while busting a nut! Do you want me to tell you what I'm gonna do with her? I have a proposition, Costa. I don't think you have anything to offer. Come on, talk! I have my gun aiming at your girlfriend. If your proposition is stupid, I'll blow her head off. You have my woman, Costa. But I have the dough, and the dope. If you return my woman unharmed I'll give you all of it in exchange for her life. What kind of trick are you trying to pull on me? You have the dough and the dope, huh? You must not love your girl that much. Why would I take the risk to pull off a trick? You want to fuck with everybody but this time you're the one getting fucked. Just say yes or no. Stud, are you still there? I accept the deal. I hope you really love your girl I don't wanna have to bust her face. I wanna hear her voice, Costa. That's ok. I'll be listening, so don't do anything foolish or I'll kill her. He wants to make sure you're still in one piece. Let him know that, doll. Gerard? Just wait, darling. I'll get you out of there. Gerard Yes? I love you Me too Sylvie... Me too. This little scene really touched me. You have half an hour to bring me the cash and the dope. If you don't honor our deal, you'll get a corpse. Got it? You don't intend to keep your word, do you? No. I'm gonna kill you. And after that, I'll straighten out your cop. You're dangerously sick, Costa. My man will do to you the same as he did to your accomplices. I'm happy today. Thanks to you I am in total agreement with the man I love. People like you need to be eliminated! Quick, Marcel! Luigi, over there! You're gonna regret looking down on Costa, slut. My god! I'm gonna start with your tits. And then I'm gonna follow with those beautiful slutty eyes. No! No! Kill me! Shut up! Oh, shit! Open your mouth. Open it! Son of a bitch! Luigi! Marcel! Answer me, goddamn it! You're all alone, Greek! All alone with me. You hear? Alone? You're finished! Come on, keep calling them! Scumbag! It's the end of the trip, Greek. I'm gonna crush you, faggot! When I'm done with you I'm gonna mail your balls to the police, you junkie! You talk too much for a guy that's about to get wrecked. Come on Greek! Come and get me! You slut! Gerard! It's over darling. It's over. Let's get out of here. I'll be right back, darling. I see you're tough, Costa. Unless... A bulletproof vest! Sick but careful. Huh, Costa? Here. A gift from my sister. And this is from me! You're gonna die like you lived, Costa. Like a faggot without balls! What happened, Gerard? I heard an explosion. It was our friend Costa. He got blown one last time. All the evidence tells us that the score settling that went down in the abandoned factory meant the end of the war between the Greek and Costa. Plus, the bike and the compass found on top of the killer's corpse confirm that Solange Ricci's murderers were four: Louis Lecas, Joseph Melinaud, Raphael Lemoine and Costa. Costa wasn't content with getting the Greek out of the way he did the same with his old accomplices. Unfortunately for him, the Greek tracked him down. Exactly, boss. Yes? Excuse me, Boss. The Minister just arrived. We'll be there right away. Let's go drink some champagne, Mr. Capes. My friends are waiting for you. You're ending your career solving a very nasty case. I'm sorry there had to be so many victims. A real shame, Mr. Minister. It's the menace that looms over every criminal. I'm very happy having known you. Without you, the Big House won't be the same. Without us, you mean. - Cheers. - Cheers, kid.
