"Everyone, deep down within, carries a small cemetery of those he has loved." Romain Rolland Hey. Come on. Let me. Let me. Let me. Stop it! No. All right, all right now. Sit up, sit up. Take some, take some. Slowly... Breathe. Breathe. Michi! Michi! Michi! Michi? Michi. Listen. Wait... Stop! That's mine. It was my dad's. OK. Mabel! Are you OK? Mabel! Mabel. Mabel. I'm sorry. Anita, I haven't been able to reach you. Call me when you can. Love you! It's Mum. Hold on, I'll be right with you. Hey. Hey! Let's get started. Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Breathe. Let's see... Look. Let's see There it is. That's it. OK? - Hold on. - Let's see... Very nice, isn't it? Very nice. Yes, it looks good on you. Not this. This one! Put it on. This one's nice. Those are mine. No, they're mine. No. I remember I bought them at a sale. A life of stealing my socks. Here. I'll get it. OK, give it to me. Grab it hard, Jorge. Careful, careful of the wall here. There. Let's see... There, OK, turn it. A bit. Careful. OK, move. Stand aside or I can't... Let's see. That's good. Up just a little. Let's see. That's good. Careful, careful. Wait. Your back OK? Yeah. No, no, it's not like that, Ana. Just a quick call. Come on. It's your mum. Call her. Please. OK. I can understand. Also understand me. Yes, but try to understand the situation. Yes... Yes... Jorge! Keep at it! Ouch! What is it? I... I twisted it. Let me see... Don't make such a fuss. I don't get it, I've always kept it in the same place. I can't believe it, Mabel! It should be in a handier spot. - This can't be. It was here. - If something happened, some emergency, what then? It was here. Mabel... Here it is! Muzak. Hello. Hello. More muzak. That hurts. Take it easy, that hurts. OK, but I have to tighten it a little. OK, but not so much. The finger, the finger you're pressing with! - Wait, wait. Careful. - It hurts there. Stop moving your foot. It hurts because you're moving. No, wrap it around... Keep your foot still. - Wrap it around the sole. - Keep your foot still. - Around the bottom! - I'm going to do that! - But here... - Just let me tighten it here a bit. This is where you hurt it. I tell you that that... No, no, no. It won't make it through. I was right. Yes, it will. No, it won't. Wait. It's really heavy, man. It's not so heavy. Come on. It's really heavy. Maybe not for you there... It's going, it's going, Mabel. It'll make it. Look. OK. Slowly. Lift it a little the bed. Lift it a little. - I can't. Wait, let's see. - Come on! - Come on. Are you pushing? - No, but you're twisting it this way. Let's back up a bit. OK, back up. That's it. Now we've got it. This way. - This way, look. Look. - It'll get hit with the door there. - But look... - Move. Get out of the way. Keep the car. I'm not going to learn to drive. OK. If you need a good electrician, Paulo recommended one. I'll let you know. OK. I don't know what I'm going to do with all the plants. Why? They don't look good. What are you doing? - Come on, move over a little. - No, I'm was in the bathroom first. Well, give me a little room. But stop. Careful. Move over. - Hand me the soap. - The soap, no. - Please. - No, no, no. I got it first. Go get another bar. - What? - Let me. But why do you have to come right now? - Get out. - But I have to take a shower. Whoa, look out. I'm going to fall. No, you're not. This is yours. These are my vitamins. Pridisol... This is mine. Another expired one. This is mine. Hey, look, I used to take this. This is good stuff. I'll take this. This is expired. There's only one of these left. Good for nothing. But one might be enough... Here, this is yours. This too. It's still OK, right? Here. This is mine. What's this one? This is really good, this drug. I'll give you half. - Look, this is excellent. - All right. One's going to be bigger than the other. Oh, well. I'm going to go pick up some food. All right. What happened? I thought something had happened to you. No. Nothing happened. I went to the chicken place... and it was really crowded... Of course. Of course... Want to eat? This house is so big. Why did we buy such a big house? It might seem out of place to you, but I saw this... and I thought you would like it. What? Thanks. Want to watch a movie? Sure. - Which one? - You choose. This one. Hey. Hey! Hey. Don't stay here. Let's go to bed. You'll sleep all twisted up. Mabel... I love you very much. I'm going to miss you. Me too. Don't fall asleep. The moving truck will be here soon.
