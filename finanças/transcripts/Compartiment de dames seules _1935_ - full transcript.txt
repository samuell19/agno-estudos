My dear children, congratulations! I wish you all the best. Thank you. - Happy? - Happy. And you? - I'm happy, but I'm scared, too. - Of what? That it'll all come crashing down. It's too good to last. Come on, let's hurry. Everyone's waiting for us. Come on. Make yourself presentable, my girl! There you are. What about your bowtie? Yes. - It's fine. - I have to do everything! Oh congratulations, Herminie! Your son-in-law is charming. You can say that again! He's an angel! Oh, Thomery! Don't make that face. There we go. Nicole… congratulations. Thank you for coming, Philippe. I'll be at the lunch, too. I suppose you will, yes. To think that nitwit asked you to marry him… - But now I'm yours, Robert. - I always knew! - Oh, Madame Petit-Roncin! - Monsieur Monicourt. How touching! - A marriage for love. - Yes. - Do they realize what happiness awaits? - Oh… Don't talk about things you know nothing about! Of course, they're very happy. - Madame. - Aren't you a friend of the Monicourts? I am. - I haven't seen the groom's family. - He doesn't have any. - Is it true? - What? - The groom is 20 years her senior. - Never! - Oh yes. - Well! Hello. Oh! You're so pale! I can tell you must be ravenous. - It's not for you! - What did I do? To think she chose that stick insect over me! - Excuse me? - Nothing, sorry. You don't have any rum baba? Thank you. Write this down. Once you get to Joigny, stop for half an hour. Joigny, half an hour. - Stop for tea and biscuits. - Tea… - Light. - Light. With biscuits. - Dry. - Dry. - What type? - Whatever you think, Robert. In Saulieu, get out at the Hôtel du Grand Duc. At the Hôtel du Grand Duc. - Anything more to add? - No. Oh, yes! I don't like the look of your servant. That's a pity. I can't get a new one. - I'll give him his notice. - No need. I've already done it. I knew you'd agree. Thank you Herminie, you did the right thing. Oh, Robert, you're the son-in-law I was dreaming of! Herminie, you're the mother-in-law I never dared dream of… - See to it that everyone finds the buffet! - Don't worry about that. Say… I've got a lovely girl at the moment. But she's leaving tomorrow for Nice. So I got the doctor to prescribe my wife sea air! I'd like to speak to Mme Monicourt. - Of course. Are you family of the groom? - Not at all. - I don't know if Madame will… - She will. It's personal. Tell her Isabella des Folies Bergères is here. And where did you meet her? At the Folies Bergères. I can still see her. Completely naked! Completely naked? In the middle of the room? No! On stage. - If you could only meet Bebelle. - Bebelle? Yes, that's what her close acquaintances call her. Her shoulders, her arms… - Her breasts! - Nice ones? She does a sensual musical number. Nudity and music all in one. - Nudity… - She's a real star. And what a repertoire. "Balmy mimosa breeze." "March of the boy scouts." "A frenzy of dragonflies." And her biggest hit: "When the charcoal blooms." How charming! One! Two! One, two, three! What on earth are you doing? Swedish gymnastics? Precisely that. - Yes, he suffers from rheumatism. - That's right. - Show her. - No, you show her! - Does it help you my dear? - Oh! Like this. Now if you don't mind going into the reception area, I have a guest. It's all yours! We'll have a glass of champagne. Certainly not! No champagne for you. I've told the staff to serve you mineral water. Someone needs to keep an eye on your health! How lucky I am to have a wife like you! A very lucky man indeed… Mineral water! What next? Please come in, Madame. Please excuse my dreadful timing. - To whom do I owe the pleasure? - Isabella. Please, take a seat. Isabella, from the Folies Bergeres. I'm a singer and striptease artist. How curious! You don't mind appearing on stage in undergarments? Undergarments? Who do you take me for, Madame? I sing completely naked. Completely naked? You've come to tell me that on my daughter's wedding day? About the wedding… What about it? - I'm here for my money. - What money? The money to rent the villa in Nice. Oh, thank goodness. It's for the honeymoon suite for my daughter! Please excuse me, Madame. I'll get you the 10,000 francs. - Are there any rum babas left? - They've all gone, Monsieur. Never mind. I never was a lucky man. There are some delicious caviar sandwiches. - Oh! Give me four. - Here you are. Excuse me, Madame. Can I show you to the buffet? Thank you! But I'm not here for the party. Ah, my apologies. Isabella, des Folies Bergères. - Oh! I recognize you. - Even with my clothes on? How flattering. - Well… - What are you doing this evening? - This evening? - I'm inviting a few friends to supper. - Impossible, I'm afraid. - Even if I insist? Even if you insist. I'm the groom. - Pity. I retract my invitation. - Thank you all the same. For tonight, at least. You can retract it for tonight and all the other nights! I'll be a faithful husband. I know you men too well. Like the back of my hand. I know. Please excuse me, I'm leaving shortly. - For my place? - Your place? Yes. The villa in Nice is mine, Monsieur. Oh, now I understand! In that case perhaps we will cross paths! Perhaps. Perhaps. An scrupulous property owner if ever I saw one. Nicole! I don't have time, Papa! Just one little minute! You're leaving so soon. Papa, don't think about it. - You'll be joining us in two days. - I know. But you won't be my little girl like you were before. - My ray of sunshine… - Oh, papa. You know, I never was a very happy man. - But Mama loves you! - Pff… The way one might love lamb… on one's plate! In my sadness to see you leave only one thing can console me. Your happiness. - Are you happy, at least? - Yes. There's no black cloud blocking my ray of sunshine? Well there is one thing. What? Tell me. - Oh papa, you'll make fun. - What is it? - I'm jealous. - Jealous? I know Robert has had mistresses. Unforgettable memories. And I'm jealous of those memories. - Oh, silly girl! - Papa, do me a favor. Ask him about it, but be discreet. Hurry, my dearest papa! I need to get ready. - Yes, my darling. - Hurry, papa! "Be discreet." Easier said than done. - Please excuse our indiscretion… - Yes? - Are you going to have children? - What are they teaching you at school? Men aren't the ones who have babies! - How are you, Robert? - Very well. Ladies. - Chatting, were you? - Yes. - Together? - Yes. - What about? - About children. How interesting. Families… Children, homemaking, women… Women. Ah, women! My dear Robert, walk with me. Women… After you! Listen. My first lover… Was a farmer's daughter. - Oh? - Yes. Take a seat. - Her name was, er… Catherine. - I see. Yes, on the farm. We'd collect the hay. She was in a barn. - What, was she a cow? - No! The girl from the farm. - Oh, Catherine? - Yes, Catherine. She was in the barn, I walked past, she said hello. She let me in. Just like that. So in I went… She started laughing, and so did I. Then she gave me a big slap on the thigh. Then I did the same to her. - And so on we went… - Slapping each other? Yes. And that was my first love affair. What a funny story! - Now it's your turn. - My turn? Yes! I told you about my first time, what about yours? Mine? Why are you asking me that? On my wedding day? You're right. Forget about it. I'd rather be honest with you. Nicole told me to ask you discreetly. She read in a novel that the first time leaves an indelible mark in the memory. Childish stuff. - Surely not? - Yes. How amusing. I couldn't pick her out of a crowd! - A brunette? - No. - Blonde? - No. She was wearing a fascinator. - Tall? - No. - Short? - No. She was sitting down. It happened in a train. - A train? - 20 years to this day, in November. I spent the day in Paris, then the night in Versailles. I arrived at Invalides station as the train was leaving. I was able to jump in the first carriage: the ladies-only carriage. There was a woman sitting opposite. I was about to excuse myself. Then suddenly… A big black cloud that had been threatening for hours broke. A torrential storm came so I closed the window. The woman opposite me looked rather perturbed. The sky was dark. Suddenly, there was an almighty clap of thunder! The stranger let out a cry of terror. I moved closer to reassure her. Then there was another thunder clap, even louder than the last. Panic stricken, she fell into my arms. We were alone, completely alone. And the rest is history… Versailles! All change please! Versailles! All change please! She stayed in my arms all the way to Versailles. You're a good man. No, I'm an old fool. I know. But enough about me. No, let's talk about you! Do you think I didn't notice you were a martyr? Madame Monicourt crushes everyone with her authority. She's a tyrant! - A swine! - Exactly. I didn't dare say it. - A swine. - Yes. Please elaborate! But I loved Nicole. To have her mother's blessing, I knew I had to make myself scarce. Very scarce. But now I'm married, that will change! I will be the master of my own house! And I will not take notice of the orders she gives me! - What about me? - You? You're a good husband. You're allowed to be right sometimes. Robert, my son. Come here. Ah, father-in-law. Oh… Those wretched creatures! What fun it'll be! When she sees you stand up for yourself. She'll have to be positively peeled off the floor! Would there be any point? You're right, here wouldn't. She's not worth it. Wretches! Vile creatures! You should be starting your own revolution! If she smashes a plate, smash the entire set! You're right! The whole set! But… that's easier said than done. Anyway… Ah, Robert. - You're quite a man. - Yes, I know. My dear friend, would you go and see if Nicole is ready? Of course my dear friend! How could I say no to you? - Please excuse me, my dear. - No! - She's waiting for me. - Who? My assistant. I'm a lawyer. I know. But I sent your wife away to have a word with you in private. Not like that! Oh… Let me assure you, I didn't mean that. It's legal advice I wanted. I'm listening. I was speaking to an old friend just now, whose daughter just got married. She just found out that her son-in-law is a vile wretch. Good heavens! What's the quickest way to break up a marriage? Is this gentleman a convict? Worse! - A thief? - Worse! - A murderer? - Worse! He… I can't tell you. I've been sworn to secrecy. If it's not prohibited by law, the marriage promise cannot be broken. - The husband has rights. - More rights than a mother? Inalienable rights. A poor mother has no power against a wretch of a son-in-law? No. The scoundrel has the law on his side. So much for justice! The law was clearly written by men! One moment. - Are you drinking champagne? - I certainly am. - Against my orders? - Against your orders. I don't like mineral water. Oh don't you, now? No! I'll even drink the rest of these. - Oh will you, now? - Yes. - You will? - Yes. There you go, then! There you… - There you go! - Oh! - Alfred! - Herminette! - Believe me, I… - Your Nicole is very happy! Not those two again… Everyone is leaving, so we wanted to say goodbye! - Oh! Glass! That's good luck. - Yes. - Yes, good luck indeed. Goodbye! - No, do stay! You're welcome to stay. Join me in celebrating! I have a story to share with you. Would you believe that Nicole was jealous about Roberts first mistress? I asked him about it. - He told you? - He did, yes. You'll never guess what happened. A stranger on a train… It was November, 20 years ago. 20 years! Yes, in the ladies-only carriage. Who is it? - Robert. - One moment! Imagine! Today I'm covering my legs up and tomorrow he'll see me naked! - Come in. - No. - Don't you want to come in? - No. Come on in, Robert. - Ready? - Ready. Cover your eyes, Jeanine. And then, my friends… Another thunderclap! And the woman is so afraid, she jumps into his arms. Goodness gracious! And she stayed there until Versailles! Need I say more? Oh… It was him! I've found him! Isn't that a funny story? - What do you say to that? - Very funny. Good heavens! I'm late. I won't say goodbye. We'll see you in Nice! See you there. Remember, the story's a secret. Eh? I'll see you out. 20 years. In November… November, December, January, February, March… Of course! Thomery! My dear Thomery. My dear Thomery. Do you still love Nicole? - Then all is not lost. - Oh? Go to the Palace Hôtel, in Nice, in two hours. - But whatever for? - That's an order. An order! Is everything there? The suitcases? Yes, we're just waiting for you! Three minutes! Do you have a warm coat? Yes, your mother gave me one. I think it's swine… Robert, my dearest Robert. You're leaving and taking my little Nicole! Any last recommendations? I'm listening. Promise me you'll never repeat what I'm about to tell you. - Oh, of course not. - Thank you. I have a secret I've kept throughout my marriage. - Oh, there's no need to share it. - It's killing me. I feel very close to you. And I know the feeling is mutual. I can't keep quiet any longer. Nicole is not my husband's child. - What are you saying? - Only the truth. Then who is the father? A stranger. - A stranger? - Yes. 20 years ago, my husband went on a business trip. It was one night in November I was taking the train from Invalides to Versailles. When suddenly a man came into the carriage. A handsome man. I myself was at my peak. Suddenly, a storm broke out. One clap of thunder! Then another! Please, spare me the rest. - And then? - What? Nine months later, Nicole was born. How dreadful! Robert, do you hate me? Yes… No… I don't know. Now you know everything. Promise this secret dies with you? I'll take it with me to the grave. - We'll die together. - Oh, thank you Robert. - Thank you. - Robert? Papa? Papa, where are you? Please don't say papa… The suitcases are in the car. I've given Firmin our instructions. Is everything ready to go? Where's Robert? He's coming, papa. Don't sleep without your clothes on you'll catch a death! Goodbye, papa. My daughter… She's my daughter. I just became my wife's father. Goodbye, mama! See you in Nice in two days! - Not long now! - Goodbye. Oh… - Be careful! - Yes… Goodbye. Goodbye. - Well… goodbye… - Goodbye! Yes, goodbye. Straight to Nice. Don't go too fast! Goodbye children. Be careful! I dare you to put your dirty hands on her, you wretch! I feel fine here with you. Me too. Nicole, show some decorum! We're not alone. Firmin. NICE 800 KM NICE 450 KM NICE 125 KM NICE 1 KM My poor head… Oh my… - Good day, Madame. - Hello, Mariette. Did Madame have a good journey? Awful. Mariette, fetch some aspirin. Monsieur has a migraine. Do you think it'll help? I've never felt so bad in my life. Firmin, call for a doctor. No! No doctor. I just need peace and quiet. - Lots of it. - My poor darling! My wife is my daughter, my daughter is my wife. The bloodline ends here. Luckily my mother-in-law is arriving soon. Once she's here… Robert? Robert? - How do you feel today, darling? - A little better, thank you. I must get ready. Your parents are on their way. - But you have all the time in the world! - No, I want to get ready now. - Is that all I get? - It's a little difficult right now. As soon as I'm ready, I'll shout: "Cooey!" - Promise? - Promise. There. If she insists, I sense its not going to end well. - The newspapers, Madame. - Thank you. Firmin, go and see who's there. - It's Madame Petit-Roncin. - Drat! Tell them we've gone out. As you wish. Is there anyone home? Ah, hello Firmin. Are the Mérinvilles awake? - Yes, Madame, but they've gone out. - Already? I've brought them some flowers. Can you do something with them? No! I want to arrange them myself. Off you go! Here resides the man who took advantage of me in the ladies-only carriage. I should run away, perhaps. Yet he's responsible for the greatest joy I've experienced as a married woman. Firmin? - Where are you? - It's him! That's his voice. Firmin? Firmin? Oh… Madame Petit-Roncin. What a lovely surprise. - Pleasant journey? - Excellent. What's the matter, Madame? - Are you unwell? - No, I'm very well. You startled me. Your servant said you'd gone out. Gone out? You told Madame we'd gone out? My apologies, Monsieur, I thought… You thought? Are you not able to find out the facts before answering? Go on… He's so handsome when he's angry. Off you go! - Please excuse me. - I brought you roses. - And now I must dash. - Dash? But the Monicourts are arriving at 11. Won't you stay? I don't want to intrude. Nonsense! I mean… Ah, Nicole! Cooey! Cooey! Cooey, Nicole! Look at the beautiful roses our friend has brought for you. Madame! You shouldn't have. - May I take off my hat? - Of course! Ah, Madame Petit-Roncin would like to meet with your parents. I declined at first but your husband kindly insisted. But Robert, the house isn't ready for guests. We can do that later! My dear friend, I'm terribly sorry. I understand, I'm a homemaker myself. I'll come back later. And thank you once again for the flowers. Excellent. That's that out the window. - Goodbye, Madame. - Goodbye. - Hasn't the house been cleaned by now? - It has. It's an excuse to be able to spend time alone with you. Since Versailles, we haven't had a moment alone. What have you done? It was… I wanted to call for Firmin. - What for? - Breakfast. It's been served! Come along. Hurry! I made biscuits. You must tell me what you think. - Firmin, help me clean this up. - Of course, Monsieur. You must find any excuse to come into the room every two minutes. - Every two minutes? - Yes. Firmin, stick that back together and make sure it's not noticeable. - Robert, are you coming? - Coming! Stick it together… What are you doing? I'm sitting you here so you can be closer to me. There. Now, now… this is highly inappropriate. If anyone saw us… Up you get. "Highly inappropriate!" Don't you remember when we were engaged? - But now we're married. - And`? So we're not engaged anymore. - Are you drinking chamomile? - It goes well with biscuits. - Goodness me, you're still unwell. - No, just a little nervous. It's the sea air that… - Excuse me sir. - What is it? I just noticed how strong the chamomile is. - It certainly is. Off you go. - Off you go. Go on! Interrupting us just for that! What's gotten into him? He could have found a better reason. - A better reason? - I mean… I mean he has the best intentions. - So do you still love me? - Do I love you? Alas, yes. - Alas? - I didn't mean to say that. What do you want now? I came to see whether there's enough sugar. Yes, there's enough sugar. Next time wait for us to call you. Ah, very well. So I can stop coming in every two minutes? - What? Who told you to do that? - Monsieur. - Oh! - Pardon? No, you've misunderstood. That's not what I asked. I said "Don't interrupt us every two minutes." That's what I said. Now off you go! Go on! - Don't you want to be alone with me? - It's not that. Then what's wrong? You've been avoiding me for three days. When I go to kiss you, you kiss my head, like papa does. Like papa… When we were engaged, you used to kiss me. Yes, I remember. Don't you want my lips anymore? - Yes… - So what are you waiting for? Kiss me! Uh… not now! It's five to. Can we only kiss on the hour? No, I have an appointment with thingy… With thingummy… With Dominique. - Who's that? - A man I have to see about a horse. You must understand. Where's my hat? - Take me with you. - No. Business and women don't mix. Goodbye. I'll be back for your parents' arrival. What's the matter with him? Is it me? He had the nerve to tell me that he didn't say what I said he said. Even though he said it. It doesn't make any sense. - No, it doesn't. - You're telling me. Is this sleeping beauty's house? Is there nobody here to greet us? Robert? Nicole? Mama! Papa! - Nicole! My sweetheart! - Hello. I've missed you so much. Oh, dearest mama. Since you were born, All I've wanted is your happiness. - What makes you say that? - I'm a little emotional. Two whole days since I last saw you! - Let me hug you again. - Oh, no. - Let me go! - Oh papa. Hello, papa. - Take all that. - I guess I'll take the suitcases. Everyone hands out orders here! Mariette, tell Firmin to take the suitcases. - Don't you want anything before lunch? - Yes, darling, I do. I'm not hungry. Nor is your father. Alright, fine, I'm not hungry either. Where's your husband? - Yes, where is he? - He's gone out. He had an appointment with a man about a horse. So tell me, before he gets here. - Are you happy? - Happy? Yes? Oh no… What's that face for? - Have you had an argument? - We'd need to see each other for that? - Aren't you seeing each other? - He makes excuses in the day. - What about at night? - He sleeps in his own room. We've been married for three days and I'm not his wife. - Not his wife? - No. Have you noticed something wrong? - He's nervous, feverish… - Feverish? Yes, he says the sea makes him nervous. I see what's happening. - He doesn't love me. - Quite the opposite! - He loves you too much. - Too much to… Yes. It's a common phenomenon in the first days. Remember, Herminette? I went to see a pharmacist. - Not in front of your daughter! - You're right… But don't worry darling. I'll have a word with your husband. - Excuse me? I'll speak to him. - You? Speak to a man about that? - A son-in-law is not a man. - Then what is he? Show me the rooms. Then you can get dressed as well. We all know how it ends when she tries to fix other people's happiness. But I like my son-in-law. - The suitcases, sir. - Ah, Firmin, there you are. Perfect. Don't leave anything. Take it all up to the bedrooms. Firmin, where's the trunk? How could you forget the trunk? - I didn't forget it, I just… - Never mind. Tell me… Does the sea air have any particular effect on you? - Effect? - Yes. Does it do anything to you? - Ah… yes. - Haha! - A flattening effect. - Not at all. - Quite the opposite! - Oh? Very well… Thank you. So it isn't the sea air. - Ah! There you are. - Robert! Apologies, I went horse riding. - Horse riding, in a suit? - Yes, it's more comfortable that way. My dear father-in-law, have you seen Nicole? Yes, about that. Those with a nervous disposition shouldn't have their honeymoon by the sea. - She told you? - It's ridiculous. - She thinks you don't love her. - Poor thing. Don't worry. Great heavens! You're not the first person this has happened to. It's very normal. To think I made him a cuckold without even realizing. - What was that? - Nothing. Monsieur Monicourt, I'm sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. - There is. - Not at all! Take her to the mountains! - Who? - Egad! Your wife of course. - Where is my bag? - My wife! I'm off. Stand up for yourself! - Tell her where to go! - That's it, tell her where to go! - I'm going for a walk on the beach. - Oh, okay. - Robert! There you are. How do you do? - Yes. - Not very well, thanks. - Goodness! What's wrong? Having problems? - You could say that. - Tell me about it. Herminie, I was anxious for you to arrive. As was I. Your confession is nothing compared to what I have to tell you. You're scaring me. - Sit down, you might faint. - Tell me! In the ladies-only carriage. The stranger… - The man whose arms you fell into… - Yes? - That was me. - You? - Me! - That cannot be! - Alas. - Tell me it isn't so! It's the truth. When I think I could have been the father and grandfather of my child. Stop! I can't stand it. If only my paternal instinct would kick in. But alas. Oh… Madame Monicourt, why did you not take another train? From another station? Why did you go into the ladies-only carriage? Like you were supposed to? It would never have happened. This is where progress gets you! What to do now? There is only one end to this dreadful ordeal: divorce. Divorce, you say… - Nicole is young. - Yes. She'll soon forget. - So soon? - You'll need a reason for divorce. We must find a reason. - Let's think. - Let's think. Let's think. I know! Physical impotence. - A weak constitution. - No, think of something else. - Let's think. - Let's think. Let's think. Oh! Abuse? You could hit her in public? No, I'm no brute. If I hit my wife, I'd be hitting my daughter. - Let's keep thinking. - Let's think. Think. - I've got it! - Oh? What about another woman? A mistress? - I don't have one. - You could have. Oh, I don't have the energy. You just have to find someone who's wiling. What is it? Madame, the owner is here to do the inventory. - A brunette with a fringe? - Yes. - Where is she? - She left. Run after her! I need to ask her something. - Have you thought of anything? - No. - Well, I have. - Yes? Leave it to me. Do you suffer from seasickness? - No, why? - Then go on a boat trip for an hour. - What'll that solve? - It'll do you good. Off you go. See you in one hour, OK? - I'll just… - Go on, off you go! My apologies, Madame. Not at all. I wasn't a good host the other day But it was my daughter's wedding. My head was elsewhere! Please take a seat, I'll be with you in a moment. - Firmin! - Madame? Fetch Monsieur Petit-Roncin. Tell him it's urgent. Yes, Madame. Madame, pardon my indiscretion. - Indiscretion? - Yes. You see, I have a collection of autographs from the most famous artistes. Madame… I'd love it if I could have a few words. Aren't you one of our biggest music hall stars? - I've heard you have quite a voice. - And a body, Madame. Of course. You don't realize when I'm fully dressed. Of course. I don't wait for people to beg me to sing. Of course. Madame, what are you doing? I'm so used to singing naked, I can't remember my notes. Please, if anyone comes, I'd like you to… Please just try and keep your clothes on to sing. Alright, but if I play the piano I won't be able to do the splits. No matter. Charming, charming. - But I don't want to force you. - Not at all? Want to hear a real hit? Let me sing you "A frenzy of dragonflies". The dragonflies are in a frenzy They don't know melancholy Only debauchery… Delightful! To be frank, though… Would you like to hear my biggest hit, "When the charcoal blooms"? When the charcoal blooms The good days return Anchovy season Is the season of love When the charcoal blooms The roses do, too How delightful! How spiritual! - Don't forget sensual, Madame! - Of course. Now I've heard you sing, I really do want an autograph. I'd love to, but what should I write? I don't know. Anything. I'm an intelligent woman, yet I can't think… You could put, just as an example: "Darling," "Darling," uh… "The hours I've spent in your arms…" "Your arms." "Have been unforgettable." I mean, just as an example. - "I'll wait for you…" - "I'll wait for you…" Apostrophe there. "Today at the same time…" - "As yesterday." - "As yesterday." There you go! - Isabella des Folies Bergères. - Perfect. But isn't this a love note? The most wonderful of all notes! - No, that's a bank note. - How charming! Now you have my autograph, Madame, let's move onto the inventory. Sadly, Madame, I have a guest. The maid will see to it. - Here. - Don't let me disturb you. That's very kind. Goodbye, Madame. Now for that wretched son-in-law of mine. I'll tell the world what I think of that scoundrel! - How do you do, dear friend? - Hello. You called for me. Is someone unwell? No. But I've made a scandalous discovery. - Pray tell. - In a hurry? - Rather. - Please take a seat. My son-in-law is a wretched, conniving scoundrel! - Surely not! - I assure you. For once, we actually need you. - What is it? - I've made a discovery. Robert may be mute at home, but he's been singing with the choir. - Singing? - He has a mistress. A mistress who's come all the way here. - You must be mistaken. - Mistaken? He's confessed! We're filing for divorce this very evening. Let me show you the letter I found in his coat. Divorce? Oh no… I was counting on Robert to put my wife in her place. You can't let this happen! Don't worry, you can count on me. See for yourselves. There may be mitigating circumstances. Mitigating circumstances? How can you say such things as our friend and lawyer? Madame Monicourt, you can't simply break up a marriage just like that. No court would ever take a simple letter as evidence. A simple letter? Read for yourselves! - But that's… - Yes? - Good heavens. - Isn't that enough? I can assure you it will be. - What about the mitigating circumstances? - There are none! - Ah! - It's impossible. This bastard is neglecting his wife! Cheating on her the day after her marriage! With Isabella, no less. - Isabella des Folies Bergères? No! - Yes! The two-timer! That means you have the same mistress! Once the divorce is final, I'll find another husband for Nicole. I must call Philippe Thomery, I'm expecting him. How could she? She's made you a cuckold. You get used to it soon enough. Well, not me. It's never happened to me. - No? - Never! I'd know about it! Monsieur Thomery's room, please. My poor darling. Your husband is a swine! How could he do this to us? Is that you, Philippe? You're in the middle of eating? No matter, I'll do the talking. Do you hear me? Yes? We're filing for divorce. No, not me, Nicole! Yes, she's getting a divorce. - Your trunk, Monsieur. - Very good. That's the small one. You'll have to bring the large one, too. And the phonograph and the golf clubs. - And the bicycles. - I saw. The cuckold himself. There you are! I was waiting for you. - Ah, my dear father-in law. - Father-in-law? Come here. - So you have a mistress? - That's right. - You're a wretch. - I certainly am. Heavens above, if you have a mistress, don't leave letters lying about! - I did? - I'm not finished! And if you do get caught, you don't confess to your mother-in-law! - Confess? - Honestly! You make up an excuse! Have you no imagination? - Um… - Silence! - Promise you'll never see her again. - No, I can't. You're refusing? That's right. She's under my skin, in my head, I can't live without her! - I'll save you in spite of yourself. - Impossible. Where does she live? I'll find her, speak to her. - She'll slam the door on you. - I'll go through the window. I certainly won't give you her address. As for her name… Don't ask. You may have feelings now, but Nicole loves you, she'll forgive you. - No, this is unforgivable. - Do you want her to die of grief? Stop! I have no excuse to give you. Of course you do! All men cheat on their wives. You were just a little fast. - I'm a swine. - No. - I am. - You're not. I know you. I've known myself much longer. One cannot know oneself. Monsieur, I'm a swine and I'm in love with my mistress. So I'm getting a divorce. You can't divorce her! It's not just about her. What about me? You said you'd put my wife in her place, then the moment she says something, it's all: "I've no excuse, I'm a swine." It doesn't work like that. Oh, Monsieur Monicourt, I feel sorry for you. Robert, look at me, I'm no spring chicken. I'm getting on for fifty. And like all men of my age, I'm past it. Do you want to ruin my final days? - I'm sorry but I'm getting a divorce. - Ah! I've asked you once, I'll ask you again… Please don't insist, you're upsetting me. It's enough enough for you to break a father's heart. You're trampling all over your wife's, too. Let me tell you what I think, Robert. You're a swine! That's what I've been trying to tell you. So you agree? Yes. I mean no! We do not agree. Nicole! I want you to hear what she thinks of you. Nicole! She hates you. Yes, papa? My darling, tell him what you think of his behavior. What for? He's insulted me, bringing me to an apartment That belongs to Isabella des Folies Bergères. It wasn't me who rented it, it was Madame Monicourt. Robert, how long have you known her for? - Who, Isabella des Folies Bergères? - Yes Why, three days. Three days? I've only spoken to her once. - Once? That's all? - That's all. - Swear it! - I swear. He's lying! - Me? - Yes, you're lying. You've never stopped lying the whole time. Let me refresh your memory. Isabelle has been your mistress for five years. - Ah. - Tell them! It's true, I lied. He said it himself. - For five years, I… - Five years? - Oh! - Madame? The owner has finished the inventory. She wants to speak with Madame. - How dare she come here! - It's outrageous. Firmin, tell her to come in. You're going to see her? Why not? At this point… My darling, I don't want you to see this. It's dreadful. A veritable orgy! Oh… how awful. - Hello, Monsieur. - Hello. No need to sit down. Madame, ever since I met you, I can't think of anything else. All day, and especially at night. Your exquisite body fascinates me, intoxicates me… - Really? - Yes. You are mine, and I am yours. Talk about a faithful husband… A faithful husband who leaves his wife and her whole family to give everything he has to you. - Let's go. - Where? Wherever you want. China, Levallois… That sounds wonderful but I'm taken. He's like a father to me. I'll say I'm spending a week with my mother. Tell him that, yes. - I'll pack my suitcase. - I'll do the same. - I'll see you soon, my love. - Goodbye. And just like that, I've become a philanderer. Hello? No, no. This is Robert de Mérinville. Ah! Madame Petit-Roncin. You'd like Nicole and I to come to dinner? I'm afraid not. Because 20 years ago, I got into the ladies-only carriage and now I'm getting a divorce. Oh! He hung up. My sweet angel. He hasn't forgotten me. My dear Robert. No… that's too cold, My love… I haven't forgotten you either… When Madame Monicourt telephoned, I was at lunch. - At 11 o'clock? - Yes, in a hotel. The service is better at that time. Will you at least be a faithful husband? Nicole, my dear Nicole. I'm not good with words, but I'm touched. So very touched. Firmin, my suitcases! What are you doing here, Monsieur Thomery? Kiss me! Tell me that you love me! - May I? - Yes. Can't you answer? Then I'm coming down. - Oh Nicole, I… - Say it. Oh, how I love you! I adore you! - Get out! - This is none of your business! - What? How? - Monsieur is my fiancé. - This cretin? - Precisely. As soon as the papers go through, I'll be Madame Philippe Thomery. - The papers… - The papers! That's right. I'll be all yours my darling. Well… I'll be all hers, darling! I mean, I'll be her darling. Very well. You don't frighten me! - Promise me you'll make her happy. - What? Promise me, Philippe! - Well I never! - Promise him! - Philippe. - I promise, Robert. - But Monsieur… - Goodbye children. I'm all wet! These people are crazy. We get here, now we're leaving, they get married, now they're divorcing. The suitcases go upstairs, then they come down… I'm not a valet anymore, I'm a one-man removal company! Get a move on, I want to leave this place. I leave with a heavy heart, Firmin. Do you understand? I'm no longer trying to understand, Monsieur. - Monsieur, you're packing your suitcases? - Yes, Mariette. My wife has decided we're leaving tonight. My hat, my coat… Alright. My cane, my… Ah! That's our umbrella. - It's Monsieur Robert's. - Monsieur Robert's? He can have his umbrella! You'll see… - Oh no! It's mine. - I'm sorry Monsieur. Great! - Ah, Monsieur Monicourt. - Yes? Am I glad to see you, Monsieur Monicourt! Glad… Well, good for you. May I hug you, Monsieur? Don't you want to eat something instead? I can wait… Mariette, go and see if there are any cold meats. With some gherkins, bread, butter, an omelette, cheese and fruit. - That'll be all. - Of course, Monsieur. I'm filled with happiness, Monsieur Monicourt. So you're going to be my son-in-law. What do you think of your mother-in-law to be? A finer woman there never was. Well, in your household, she'll be making all the decisions. Giving out all the orders. Oh, how wonderful. I hate making decisions. It bothers me, it vexes me, it ruins my appetite. I spend my life raising a daughter to hand her over to this cretin. - What's that? - You disgust me. It's irreparable. Why do I disgust him? To annul the marriage, Petit-Roncin says I should write to the Pope. The earlier the better. See you shortly, my darling. - Where are you going? - To see the Pope. Why do I disgust him? - Oh, my dear Philippe, there you are! - Madame! - Call me mama. - Yes Madame… I mean mama. - I'm going out. I'll be right back. - Yes mama. - Will you always obey me like that? - Blindly, mama. Oh, how I love this boy! Your meal is served. - You haven't forgotten the pickles? - No, Monsieur. Here. It's irreparable. - So he's packing his cases? - Yes. - You're so sad, my darling. - I really am, papa. Me too… Mariette! Where is Monsieur Mérinville? In his room. I'll tell him you're here. No! I'll tell him myself. Come in. Monsieur Mérinville. No, this needn't be done in private. I'll get to the point. Madame Monicourt found in your pocket… A letter that leaves no doubt about my relationship with Isabella. - You admit it. - I admit. And I'm leaving with her in one hour. - You're leaving? - Yes. But what if this woman is taken? She told me about a troublesome man. Nothing important. Some old geezer. - Is that so? - Yes. Who you're talking to now! - You don't look like a geezer. - Well I am. That's me. The old geezer! I say… - He slapped me! - He's a brute, Monsieur. He forgot his hat. His hat? Ah, his hat. Come in! - What is it? - Monsieur… What is it? Speak! - A letter has arrived. - Give it to me. The letter isn't for Monsieur… It's for M. Mérinville. Given the circumstances, I don't know… Well leave it there. - Thank you, Mariette. - Monsieur. A jilted wife has the right to know! Ah… It's a woman's writing. A jilted wife indeed. Does she have the right? Oh of course you have the right. You're right, papa. It's evidence. Let's see. "My darling…" Oh! "My darling…" "I haven't forgotten you over the last 20 years." 20 years! That isn't Isabella. It's signed: "The stranger from the ladies-only carriage." - Read it, papa! - Very well. "Since you told me you still love me, I'm leaving my home." "Meet me at 12 o'clock behind the casino." "The stranger from the ladies-only carriage." And he swore to you he'd never seen that woman again? He still loves her after 20 years? Well I never. She must be older and wiser now. So he has two mistresses! The dancer from Folies Bergères and the stranger from the train. I'm going to have a word with your husband. Just you wait! Two mistresses! The flukey thing… - Sorry to disturb you. - I was packing my suitcases. You've no time to lose. She'll be waiting at 12 o'clock behind the casino. - 12 o'clock? Who? - One of your two mistresses. - I swear I only have one! - How are we supposed to believe you? You're a cynic. What'll you do about the stranger from the train? What do you mean? 20 years ago, on the train from Versailles. Do you deny staying in touch? - Oh, good heavens! - Be happy she still loves you! - She loves me? - She's leaving everything for you! For me? Oh no, she told you. She wrote a letter. It was addressed to you but I read it. Do I know this woman? No, I promise you don't! How did he not recognize her writing? Running away with my mother-in-law? It's a living nightmare! Run away with her? What a crazy old bat. Old geezer… me? - Is my wife here? - No, Monsieur, she's still out. - Very well, leave me be. - Very well, Monsieur. I won't talk to her. I'll write a letter. It's more dignified. I'll be braver this way. "Isabella…" No. "Madame…" It's colder. "You have betrayed me. "with Robert Mérinville. "You can go and live with your mother… "with… your mother… "And stay there until the end of your days." Paul, please forgive me! - What are you saying? - Paul, forgive me! - You heard? - Yes. But let me explain. He was in the ladies-only carriage. Because of the storm. - Because of the storm? - Yes, in the train. Robert Mérinville kissed me until we arrived in Versailles. The bastard! The stranger in the train was you? Didn't you know? - Why were you writing me that letter? - I… I knew everything, Madame! But I wanted to hear it from you. It wasn't my fault, it was the storm. - It was 20 years ago! - And? - 20 years! Let bygones be bygones. - I shall not, Madame! As for your lover, I'll have his guts for garters! - Paul! - Paul nothing! - Oh, Paupaul. - Paupaul nothing. - Get out! - Oh no… - Paul… - Out! Does that wretch have to get his filthy hands on every woman of mine? Oh! Firmin, is everything ready? Take the suitcases down. Mariette, I'm leaving. Before I go, let me give you some advice. If you ever marry, don't marry your father. Here's a letter for Madame Monicourt. Please give it to her when she's alone. Yes, Monsieur. Goodbye, Mariette. I'm going to my mistress. -That's dreadful, Monsieur -Mariette. The older you get, the more you'll see: Life is nothing but a string of dreadful occurrences. - Here. Give me that! - Monsieur, it's for Madame. Oh give it to me, it's not important Go on! "Herminie, your letter was discovered by Nicole and your husband." "Luckily, they didn't recognize your writing. "Forget about me. Let's not make things worse. Forget that fateful night we spent in each other's arms on the train to Versailles. Adieu, Robert." Herminie? But… I must be dreaming. It was my wife all along? The stranger from the ladies-only carriage was my wife? She betrayed me. She betrayed me. She betrayed me! Freedom! This is cause for divorce! It's time for a divorce! Mariette, where is he? - Who? - Robert! Sorry, Monsieur de Mérinville. I must see him. His life is at risk! If my husband finds him, he'll kill him! - Monsieur is no longer here, Madame. - Oh, it's too late. He's gone to be with the one he loves. He's looking for me! - He may still be in the garage… - I'll go. The garage! You should have said. To the garage! Firmin, go and get the rest of the suitcases. - Robert! - Madame? - Oh, it's you! - What? - I'm here! - Oh, Madame Petit-Roncin. - You can call me Cleopatra. - What? Oh! You don't know it was me. Is this a riddle? The stranger from the ladies-only carriage was me! - What? - It was me. - You? Cleopatra? - Yes, Robert. - Swear it's not a lie? - I swear. - Then the letter… - I sent it. - It was you? - Who? Nothing. My husband knows. We must leave immediately! - Oh, now I understand! - You do? - What joy! - Now I understand! Herminie must know what I think of her. And to get revenge, she… Oh! That old cow! May she go to the devil! - What are you saying? - Nothing. My wife is not my daughter and I am not her father. - You're tired, my love. - No! I'm overjoyed. I've been waiting here for an hour. - Good heavens! Isabella… - Excuse me. Alright, let's go. Go? I… I have to go. Help! Someone help! Slap his cheeks! He needs air! I don't think we've met but you came at the right time. A pleasure, Madame. It's probably just indigestion. Good heavens! It's just the joy of leaving with the one he loves. - He told you? - Yes, just now. I'm going to make him very happy. - You're going to make him happy? - Why, yes. We're leaving together. - What are you saying? - He's divorcing his wife for me. Madame, I think there's been a mistake. He's divorcing his wife for me. We're old school friends and I don't remember seeing you at the convent! We certainly weren't in the same year! Oh! People like to take me for a spin, as it were but I won't be taken for a ride. - I don't understand. - I'm Isabella. Pleasure to meet you. - I sing naked. - How awful. Speak for yourself. Not everyone would agree. Just this morning, my Ronron told me so. - Ronron? Who's that? - Paul Petit-Roncin. - Paul Petit-Roncin? Do you know him? - Do I! - Paul? - Do you? He's my husband. And I can't say I'm proud to say it. The monster! Goodbye, Madame. I hope we never cross paths again. What I day. I lost them both! Little Ronron, the old beanpole. Ah well. Are you still here? - I was waiting for you. - Whatever for? I have good news. My paternal instinct has returned. Wonderful! I'm delighted. Are you leaving soon? - Oh no, I won't be leaving. - What? Firmin, take my suitcases back up. I'm telling Nicole I'm her father. What? Oh no! My blood has spoken, and so must I! What about my husband? The poor, dear man! - I've thought it all through. - And? - You can divorce. - Divorce? Herminie, will you marry me? Me? Your wife? You're already the mother of my child. - Robert! - Ninie! We could be happy together, you'll see. - Listen… - Imagine, taking care of our child. - My dear man… - We'll find her a husband. Did she not offer her hand to Thomery, the walking digestive tract? My poor woman, she deserves better than that! Listen to me! My dear Herminie, I'm sure you'll agree. - He won't listen to me! - Monsieur Thomery! - Monsieur Thomery! - Oh! The first time a man's left me speechless… - Come, my dear friend. - My dear friend! Madame Monicourt would like to tell you something. Where is my dear mother-in-law? Madame Monicourt and myself feel for you. But we've decided you won't be marrying my wife after all. That's right, my wife. - But I… I don't understand. - Look at the state of you. I… but… Madame Monicourt? Madame Monicourt agrees with me, don't you? Is that how it is? Well you know what? - You're leaving. - Yes! But… See? It all went so well. Very well. Now go and get Nicole. Alright. But please let me speak to her alone. - I want to break it gently to her. - No, no, no. That's enough of your meddling! Go and get Nicole, that's an order! That's right! Bravo! Where are you going in that outfit? Where? I'm going fishing, Madame. Then I'm having a party. - Fishing? Partying? - Silence! So it was you! And you didn't say a thing! - Oh, you told him! - I didn't say a thing. No he didn't. He wrote a letter. I read a letter he wrote for you. - How dare you! - Yes, I did dare! - And we are going to divorce. - Alfred! Alfred nothing! Alfred, I promise Nicole is your daughter. I'm not the stranger from the ladies-only compartment! - Finally, she's admitted it! - Yes, I admit it! I heard Robert say he wanted to put me in my place. I thought a man who could say that about his mother-in-law would make my daughter unhappy. - So I'm not the cuckold? - You never were, you fool! So I can't go fishing or partying? There's no divorce? - No! - Oh well, never mind. - Alfred, promise me… - No! That's enough! That's enough! - Be quiet! - Be quiet! - From now on, I'm in charge! - He's in charge. - Firmin, get the suitcases. - Firmin, get the suitcases. - Go and explain everything to Nicole. - Explain? - You'll work something out! - Go on! Go! Off you go! And then we're leaving. Good! That's how you have to treat them. Exactly! Now don't let us interrupt your honeymoon! - Goodbye Robert. - Goodbye, my dear father-in-law. He smells like fish. Whatever you do, don't mention your mother! Mama! Mama! THE END
