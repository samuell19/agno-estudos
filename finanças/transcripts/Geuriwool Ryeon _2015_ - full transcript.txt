Natural burial cost Welcome to Chollipo Arboretum No way! Women can live on after the death of their partner. But men don't live long enough after their wives die. Women have shorter life expectancy. That's why men choose younger women. What? Who said that? Women live four years longer than men on average. Then shouldn't men marry older women? Women have shorter life expectancy because they give birth. What does that have to do? Men should die earlier because they drink and smoke more. Then women really live longer? On average. Then it's a losing game for men. A losing game for men? It's a losing game for us because we're left alone. You said women live on well without their partners. Men can't get used to a life where they have to cook and clean. Well, I can cook and clean. Then you'll live on well. Then am I dying earlier than you? No. I'm dying first. But you said women live longer. Still. I want to die earlier than you. You don't want a losing game so have a longer life. Then if I die first... you'll be all alone. Well, I'll carry on somehow. What else can I do? That's nice. What's nice? Your kiss. It is nice. Yes, it's nice. - The kiss or me? - Both you and the kiss. It's nice. It is nice. [Amor] Hanyang University Guri Center Are you up now? You were so deeply asleep, sweetheart. When did you come? Just now. - You didn't wake me up. - You were deep asleep. You just came and you're dozing off? Yeah. Let's see how you're doing. Oh, I think you look better today. Better? Yeah. Did you get rid of everything I told you? Get rid of what? Photos, letters and my stuff. Everything that reminds you of me. I gave you the list. Oh, that? You lost three more kilos. We didn't have many memories to get rid of, you know. And I'm not sure if we should. We didn't? We didn't. We took most of the photos with a digital camera. And you cropped your face from the Polaroid photos. I gathered all we had and burned them in the sink. You burned them in the sink? What about the computer? You threw away the hard drive already. And I had to get a new one. You threw away and erased it all. There's nothing much left now. Oh, the plant is there. I think it's slowly dying... Well, it's already dead. Really? It will revive if you give it water and light. What? It will revive. I got rid of the iron. You could have left it. What? Kiss me. You're leaving? I can't stand it. You won't come anymore? Of course I will. You smell like cigarettes. I don't smoke. Let me smell your hands. Sniffing my hands like a dog? You smell like it. Do I still smell? I miss the nights we used to sleep cheek to cheek. I'm sorry. Where am I getting buried? Did you find a place? It's on a riverside. It's a perfect place to go alone and cry on a rainy day. You feel like crying? Um-hum. Can I get a cigarette? Take the whole pack. I'm quitting. Well, thank you. Gosh! - The seal claps! - Welcome to ZooZoo! Good girl. Okay, now you're a pilot! Give him a big hand. Hey, why are you eating alone? I came earlier. You should have asked me. By the way, are you going home right after work? - You're taking tomorrow off. - Yeah. I see. Gosh, I have a funeral tonight. But I'm on a night shift today. So I was thinking... Can you be on duty tonight until I come back from the funeral? The funeral procession leaves tomorrow. I want to be there earlier. Just for manner's sake. But who died? Well... It's not a close friend. I'm still not sure if I should go. You should go if they asked you to come. You think so? Will you be on duty for me? I will. Or we can switch shifts. I have no more night duties. That's right. - You're quitting, right? - I will. When will you make it here? Right, I'll be back before the last bus. Okay. - Are you sure? - Yep. Thank you so much. Eat. Restroom Restroom checked - 18 Missed calls - So many times? What happened? Hui-yeon I don't believe this. She gives me no time to get bored. Yeah, may I speak to patient Im Hui-yeon? Yes. She's asleep? Well, she called me not long ago. Did you give her my message? Oh, you did. Thank you, but... is she really asleep? Tae-u. Tae-u. Hey! You came. I'm sorry I'm too late. Hey, you're very late. I just had to stay around. By the way, you'll need this. - No, that's fine. - For the cab. Please. I'm sorry I'm late. There you go. 20,000 won? Who's this? Okay, she's breathing. Hello? Hey. Cover yourself. Hey, I... I'll go and ask for help. I'm going to get someone. Hey, are you okay? I'm not going to hurt you. I work here. I don't think there's anyone... I should first call the police and... Are you really okay? Okay, then... Then let's get out of here. Can you get on your feet? Okay, there you go. Carefully. Carefully. This is where I live. It's a little messy right now. It's okay. Come in. Come in. I think you need a bath, right? The bathroom is there. It's okay. You'll find anything you need there, so just take anything you need. I'll go and get some... Who's this? - Hello? - I need some air. Hey, where are you calling from? From the public phone in the hall. Why did you cancel your phone? You don't answer. Why do I need it? I keep getting unwanted loan calls. Can't you think that I might have been busy for a little while? You got me worried. I had a dream. I guess I'm really dying. Mom kept calling me in my dream. It was your dad last week. - And you never met them. - Am I annoying you? - No. - You're getting tired of me. No, I'm not. I'm not there with you anymore. You're still here. I don't have more coins, so it's going to get cut off. I'll see you tomorrow. Every day is like hell. Can we go out to eat, please? Say something. You're scaring me. You should be scared calling at night in a hospital. Actually, I called because I felt like crying. - Okay, I'm all ears. - No, I'm scared now. I should go back to my room. I don't have more coins. Hui-yeon, tomorrow I'll... Why am I sleeping here? Hey, are you okay? You fell off the bed. Drink some water. By the way. Never mind. I put some money for the cab. And that's my number. Call me if you need any help. No, I'm not reporting a missing person. I wanted to check if anyone reported someone missing. Yeah, female. Her name? I didn't ask her. I don't know her age either, so you can't help me, right? Okay, I'm sorry. Thanks. So? I gave her some money for the cab and let her go. What if she's a liar and a binge drinker? Hey, watch your language. You're a girl. - And why did you do that? - What? Why did you cancel your phone? I told you. I got tired of getting loan calls. See? You should have answered. Can't you think I've been busy? It was only 20 or 30 minutes. So you're getting mad at me? No, but you got worried. I'm not going anywhere, am I? - So you want me to get the line? - Yes! Hey, I almost forgot. The doctor promised to give me one day to go on a date with you. When? He has an important surgery today, so I think we can do it today. - Today? - Uh huh. Gosh, I almost forgot about it. I already have a list of things I want to do. But wait. Can you really go out? What? Look, the weather is great. What time is it? It must be around lunch. Really? Then let's get out of here. I'm sick and tired of the food here. You can't. Why can't I? We need the doctor's permission. We can't just leave like this. It's okay. He promised. And he's not coming today. - I'll go and check. - Hey! I'm telling you. Stay here all day long and you'll want to die. It's not mood swings. Now I can see why they have the windows only half open. Wait, I'll go and... It's nice. Please? It's nice. Okay, nice. To downtown, please. [Nangman Salon] How do I look? Good? Pretty. What do we do now? Let's walk. Aren't you hungry? Then let's have spicy rice cakes and sausages. No, let's have fried chicken. Pizza? Pasta? Maybe, some Chinese food? Seafood stew? Crab stew. Sushi and sashimi. You know I love snapper sashimi. - Halibut will be nice too. - You can't eat all that. I want to eat everything. There must be a place we can eat all of that. A buffet. - Where? - What? The buffet. You're going to eat all that? I guess I brought too much. Where do I start? Start with the bland shrimp. Shrimp? Okay. How is it? It's bland. - Eat. - Okay. Take your time. Isn't it beautiful? You want to try it on? No, I'm fine. Let's go. Tada! What took you so long? There was a long queue for the chicken. - Did I take so long? - I almost fell asleep. Here. Are you sure you can drink beer? It's just one can of beer. It's just a beverage. I'll be fine. Okay, cheers! Cheers! - Hey, it's really cold. - It's from the back of the fridge. You are so smart. It's fall. Are you cold? - I need a guitar. - There's no guitar here. You know I got some guitar lessons, right? - Just two weeks. - Fifteen days. What's the difference? Well... What song should I play? Okay. Not a new fangled song. I know. This one. Waving the white hands. - You know this song? - With a beautiful smile. You know it! Then sing with me. One, two. Waving the white hands. With a beautiful smile on your face. On your face. I saw those big black eyes filled with tears. Filled with tears. Leaning weakly on the window and holding my hand. Holding my hand. Turning back you cry without even saying goodbye. Saying goodbye. When will we ever meet again? We can't even promise to meet again. The last words she said. Tae-u, I love you. I really do. Are you okay? I don't think beer was a good idea. I feel dizzy. I want to take some rest. Gosh, you knew this would happen. Let's go somewhere and sleep. You want to go home? No, not home. To the hospital then? No, to a motel. You're crazy, huh? It's been long we did it. I think I'll feel better if I get some sleep. Let's go to the hospital. It's too late. They won't let us in. And I even drank. They might kick me out. I feel so dizzy. I really want to lie down. Please? Rodeo Motel Hui-yeon, we're here. Do we really go? Hui-yeon, are you asleep? Hui-yeon. Hey, what's wrong? Hey, Hui-yeon! How is she? Is she alright? Can I see her? She's asleep right now. She's asleep? It was too much for her for one day. It could have been serious. She's fine then? Where have you been? She said you let her go out during your rounds. I never said that. I'm sorry. Why do you think we keep her here? She can't even be treated at home. That's how serious it is. I'm sorry. I really have nothing and... no one to ask. What should I do? I don't know where to start. I mean her funeral. Hey. You're here? You didn't go home? Why didn't you call? You have my number. Let's get inside. Get up. There's nothing else but bread right now. Do you like bread? I'm glad you do. Have some milk. Okay, that's too polite. Hey... Listen. You know, I... I don't know you. And I'm not alone, actually. So if things go wrong... I might be accused of kidnapping or something like that. So I was thinking... Listen, I... You're not hearing-impaired, are you? This plant? It's was a gift but I didn't look after it so it's drying out. It will revive with some light and water. If we go back to what I was talking about... I was... Milk? No! I mean... Maybe, the calcium will help it revive. I guess it's fine? It's low fat anyway. I guess it's fine. It's fine. It should be fine. Then women really live longer? On average. Then am I dying earlier than you? No. I'm dying first. But you said women live longer. Still. I want to die earlier than you. Hey. I'll help you. I'm sorry. That's okay. You didn't have to. You're always too nice. You have too many tubes on you I can't kiss you or anything. You want to? You wanted to, right? Uh-huh. And you waited all this long? You're so silly. Did it rain at night? No, the weather is nice. I think I heard the sound of rain. It's cool and nice. I was heavy, wasn't I? You're not. I see. Hey, something strange happened. I met a girl the day I was on night duty. I think she's impaired somehow. But she reminds me of things we used to do. Did you get rid of all my stuff? Yes, everything but me. Should I donate? Donate? My body. I'm dying anyway so that might be a better idea. It's your choice. They give you money if you donate, right? You can pay your expenses with that money. Then that would be selling. You're right. I'm so stupid. Then I have no choice. I'll give you my bones. Thanks. I feel so guilty. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm leaving. And I'm annoying. I ask you to get rid of everything. But I'm leaving you with debt. Do we owe a lot of money? How much? You're not coming in the car. - Did you sell it? - Yeah. I'm really sorry. I don't know why I didn't get insurance. I'm a burden until the last moment. Look, Hui-yeon. The doctor said you're okay. You're just weak because of the surgery. You're not leaving yet. I'm sorry. I ask you not to come and to come again. It must have been so frustrating for you. Even I can't tolerate myself changing every minute. I'm scared. I'm so scared and you're the only one I have. I can only vent my feelings to you. I feel so pathetic. Well, we're orphans. I understand. What about you? I'm scared to death. You're all alone. What about you? Letter of resignation Sir, I... I'm sorry. So today is your last day? Yes. When do plan to work again? After six months, maybe. What do you plan to do? I have to find a new house. There's a lot to do. I see. Hey, can I use your car? My car? - What about your car? - I sold it. - Right. - Let me use it, okay? Okay. When do you need it? In a couple of days. Okay, anytime. Hey, if I die, are you going to be in my funeral for all three days? Three days? Come on. I'll stick around 49 days. - No more worries about it. - Come on. Darn it. You think they'll give me three days off? They don't pay us that much. They won't give me one day off. Hey, did you check that restroom? That one? Yes, I did. But no one checks it. It's always locked. No, it's open. Are you sure? Is it clean? Yeah, you didn't check? It's locked. You won't see me around for a while. You don't care, do you? You'll forget about me in a couple of months, huh? What? Is that too fast? Then after how long? I know, five months. Five. Done. Hey, it revived. It's the milk, maybe. That's amazing. It didn't even take that long. Listen, I have to go somewhere tomorrow. It's going to take me two days. You might not want to stay alone. Do you want to come? What are you doing? Should we take this? Okay, we'll take it. Did she use it? Hey! You scared me! Thanks. The insurance is for a week. Thanks. - Let me know if it takes longer. - You'll get it earlier. And it's very sensitive so be very nice on it. Okay, don't worry. Gosh, I got to go back to work. Have a nice trip. - Call me if anything happens. - I will. - See ya. - Thanks! Gosh, I don't want to work. We have individual trees. And trees for couples, families and groups too. The ones for groups are usually for young people. I heard you bury together those who died young alone. They died alone without having the chance to get married. So that might make them feel less lonely after death. Yeah, I guess so. Come this way. Are you looking for a tree in particular? What types of trees are there? Well, there are many types. Japanese white pines and pines are the cheapest. And also betel. We also have special trees. But they're too expensive. It's for rich people not us. Here's the information. - Thanks. - Bye. Chollipo Arboretum Now we'll go to my old town. It's near the beach. Let's have lunch there. What happened here? This is where my orphanage used to be. I had no idea. Then where did they go? I just want to go and check if... On both sides, see? That's it. Okay, that would be 15,800 won. You want that? Do you want this kite? Okay, let me explain this to you. You only have to fix this stick on both ends. It's easy. Everyone can fly it. And it's the most popular too. - Do you want it? - Yep. What? It's the weekend so we only have one room left. Only one room left? There's only one room available. But it's only one room. Can we...? I'll sleep in the sofa, so you sleep in... the bed. Here. This reminds me of something. I used to have the habit to say congratulations when I was a kid. So I said congratulations to anything. When I was hungry, when I tripped over. I don't know why I did that. But it became like a buzzword. So kids I didn't know would come and talk to me. So I'd congratulate them. Now that I think of it, it is a very positive word. And I've been told many times... it's difficult to get to know me because I usually don't open up. I didn't know what that meant. Now I don't know why I didn't. Let's set this off and go inside. Okay. Hello? Can I talk to Im Hui-yeon in room 1203? No, I just wanted to check if everything's alright. I see. Then would you call me back right after? Yes. Okay, bye. Manual for assembly Are you up? Well, it's ready. Let's go out and fly it. Hey! Let it go. Let's get going. Oh, where is it? Excuse me. Do you have a phone charger? - A phone charger? - Yes. Okay, thanks. S Hospital 13 missed calls The number you dialed... This way, please. I think you should see her one last time. - You can cover her. - Okay. Im Hui-yeon Excuse me, are you Tae-u? Yes? Do you have a photo? What photo? I need her photo for the funeral. Oh, that photo. But I didn't throw it out. Hey, what's going on? Did you see a photo I left here? A photo? Yesterday... Right, the cleaning lady cleaned it up yesterday. - When exactly? - That I don't know. What's wrong? The garbage. Oh, no! Hey, why are you outside? Oh, the door must be closed. You've been somewhere? You look healthier. It's still green. I didn't get any sleep at all. I need some sleep. Sorry but... Can you hug me? You know what? I threw out everything she asked me to. I removed everything. But it's useless. I remember everything. I loved her so much. I really loved her. I wanted to make happier memories with her. Now all those memories are only for me. What should I do? I'm scared now. I don't want to remember anymore. List of things to throw away: Shoes, photos, the plant, everything Amor Time takes everything away. We've been a couple for a long time. Whether love or memories, it's sad when it's forgotten... because as time goes by, our memories fade away. - Hui-yeon But some memories become clearer with time. - Tae-u Good memories or memories we want to forget, every one of them is cherishable. And that memory wakes us up every day. And still, a mysterious woman appeared to me. The "kite" flying up in the sky fell. Time grew farther from us, but the memory of love remained clear. Love went away nonchalantly erasing the memory. If only we could turn back time... Time took everything away.
