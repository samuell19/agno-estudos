Woman: Here he comes! Oh, it's turning. Oh, oh, Elvis! Elvis! Mr. P., can I get you some sandwiches? That will be fine, Pauline. I'm gonna check on Lisa Marie, honey. Okay. Sleep tight, darling. Radio announcer: Good morning, everybody. It's WGAN radio in Portland, Maine. It's ?? Degrees and 8:05. Time to get ready for Elvis Presley. Elvis will be coming later today for his concert at the Cumberland county auditorium. Elvis' show is almost sold out, but we have six tickets here at WGAN and we'll be giving them away to you, so stay tuned. You just might be a lucky winner. Colonel Parker is already over at the Sheraton hotel, and Elvis' guys are setting up for his arrival. So don't touch that dial if you want yo know everything. I'll be talking to some of the "Memphis mafia," as they've come to be known, and we'll have the up-to-the-minute word on what's happening with Elvis in Portland. Elvis is still in Graceland, his home in Memphis. ?? But he'll be arriving here later this afternoon in his personal jet, the "Lisa Marie." Now, here's another Elvis record, his latest hit ...

Yeah, Joe. Colonel, I'm at baptist memorial hospital. I'm afraid I've got some terrible news. Elvis is dead. Reporter: Pandemonium has broken out here on Elvis Presley boulevard in Memphis. Thousands of fans from all over the country are converging on Graceland trying to get in to view the body of the 42-year-old king of rock and roll. The world is shocked by Elvis Presley's sudden death after attempts to save his life failed. The apparent cause, according to his personal physician, Dr. George Nichopolous, is a heart attack. The singer's father, Vernon Presley, has requested that an autopsy be performed. Everyone stay back! I was raised on Elvis. We started when I was 10 years old. My mother and daddy loved him, and I just say I was raised on him. There's nobody else like him and there won't ever be anybody else like him. Man: Why go to all this trouble? Because we love Elvis. We still do. You're not going to get in, you know. Doesn't make any difference. I'm friends with a few people in the group, I want them to know I'm here. Maybe they'll see me on the street. We loved him very much. I just can't believe he's dead. It's terrible, but I just thank god that Elvis died here in Graceland instead of on the road like any other rock and roll singer. Whether you're black or white, whether you're country, redneck, or a freak, young or old, from Moscow, London, or Memphis, Elvis Presley will still be the king of rock and roll to me. Please wait up against the curb. Elvis: I was born in a small cotton town in the rolling hills of Mississippi. I guess Tupelo was as good a place as any to grow up in. As far back as I can remember, grandma lived next door. Daddy was a sharecropper, and most of the time we got by alright. But one year, he went to prison after writing a bad check for some food. Mama got us through by taking in washing and sewing. Mama and I were always real close. I had a twin brother, Jesse, but he died at birth, so I was an only child. [ People singing gospel music ] We were a religious family. The first singing I ever did was in church.

This friend of mine used to take me across town to an area called Shakerag, and that was when I first heard the blues. It sure was a lot different than the music we were singing in church.

Elvis sure loved that guitar. There simply wasn't enough work for Vernon in Tupelo. He tried everything he could, but we just couldn't make a steady living down there. We hated to admit it, but we were broke...Flat broke. We packed everything we could into our old Plymouth and moved on. Things just had to get better. Elvis: The years in Memphis weren't much easier for us, but at least daddy had a job at a paint company and mama was working part time. Around other kids, I felt kind of different. Maybe it was the clothes I wore, that I had long hair and sideburns when other guys had crew cuts, but somehow I just didn't fit in. I guess, in a way, I was kind of shy, but I knew something good was going to happen to me someday. I just didn't know what. ♪ Let me introduce my new rocket 88 ♪ ♪ yes, it's straight just won't wait ♪ ♪ everybody likes my rocket 88...♪ I worked different jobs after school so I could afford my favorite R&B records and sharp clothes.

But I liked my hair long, 'cause that's the way truck drivers wore it. I went to Humes High in Memphis, where I got my share of B’s and C’s. I thought I might do better in music, but the teacher gave me a flat F and wouldn't let me in the glee club. [ Accordion music plays ] That was very good, Mandy. Thank you. Alright. Our next "club day" performer is Elvis Presley. Elvis? Come on up. It's your turn. Elvis: I was real nervous when I had to get up there. I thought most of the kids in class were going to laugh at me 'cause they figured I wasn't good at anything.

And after that, I could always count on my music to help me make friends... Especially girls. After graduating high school, I made a record for my mama's birthday. I'd kind of gone there to be heard by the owner, Sam. Later, Sam called me back to work with Scotty Moore and bill black, two fine musicians. At the time, Sam Phillips was recording a lot of black artists, and the word around Memphis was he was looking for a white singer with a black sound. We tried to cut a record for six months with about 50 songs. Nothing sounded right. Alright. Hold it, you guys. Bottom line here is this is just not making it. Now, if we can get something that will, great. If not, let's rack it up. Elvis, you can pull it out of yourself. You can do it. Alright, sir. Do you guys remember that old blues song we used to do?

I want you people to come see us. Remember, Phillips told you, "that's all right, mama." ♪ I'm leavin' town today ♪ Suddenly, it was like my whole world turned upside down. We played local gigs all through the south. Everywhere we went, the crowds got bigger and the girls Wilder. Then one crazy day, we were somewhere on the road, I don't even know where, a man came backstage and introduced himself ... Colonel Tom Parker. Vernon: Our son wasn't even 21 when Gladys and I first met colonel Tom Parker. He was already well-known for having managed Hank snow and eddy Arnold. Right from the start, colonel Parker believed in Elvis. Then in 1956, the country got its first look at Elvis on national television. Ladies and gentlemen ... I'd like to present one of radio's most listened to disc jockeys ... bill Randall. William. [ Applause ] We'd like at this time to introduce you to a young fellow who, like many performers, Johnnie ray among them, come up out of nowhere to be, overnight, very big stars.

It's shocking. I watched him gyrate his legs and swivel his hips, and our parent-teachers group feels he should not be on television. We've set up a 20-man committee to do away with this vulgar, animalistic, nigger, rock and roll bop. Our committee will check with the restaurant owners and the cafes to see what Presley records is on their machines, and then ask them to do away with them. Elvis: People started calling me a sex maniac, saying I was lewd and obscene. It got to be ridiculous when the police filmed my shows. I thought the bad publicity would hurt my career, so I took a shot at telling my side of the story. [ Ringing ] Woman: Hello? Hy Gardner calling. I have Elvis Presley on the phone. Hello, Elvis? Less than two years ago, you were earning $14 a week as a movie Usher, and then $35 a week for driving a truck in Memphis. Today, you're the most controversial name in show business. Has this sudden notoriety affected your sleep, your appetite, or the size of your head? Not the size of my head. It's affecting my sleep. How much sleep do you get? I average about four or five hours a night. Is that enough? No, but I'm used to it and I can't sleep any longer. What do you keep in mind mostly? I mean, some of the songs you're going to do, or some of your plans or what? What goes through your mind? Well, everything has happened to me so fast in the last year and a half till...I'm all mixed up, you know? I can't keep up with everything that's happening. Your style of gyrating while you sing has been bitterly criticized even by usually mild and gentle TV critics. Do you bear any animosity towards these critics? Well, not really. Those people have a job to do and they do it. Do you think you've learned anything from the criticism leveled at you? No, I haven't... Because I don't feel I'm doing anything wrong. ♪ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog ♪ ♪ cryin' all the time ♪ Rock and roll has got to go... And go it does. At KWK, we're all through playing rock and roll records. This week is record-breaking week here at KWK. And after this week, no more rock and roll will be played on the air. The obscenity and vulgarity of the rock and roll music is obviously a means by which the white man and his children can be driven to the level with a nigger. It is obviously nigger music. It is our feeling here in Jersey city that this rock and roll rhythm is filled with dynamite, and we don't want the dynamite to go off in the Roosevelt stadium in Jersey city. After, uh...We, uh... Heard about the incidents throughout the country and the coming of this concert to Jersey city, I asked our commissioner of public safety, Lawrence Whipple, to look into the matter, and he did make a survey of the situation. My department made a very thorough investigation of these so-called programs. We had telephone conversations and correspondence with various municipalities. Included among these being Hartford, Connecticut, orange, New Jersey, Asbury Park, and the city of Hoboken. We find that these programs are not for the good of the community, and that's why I ordered them banned. I don't see that any type of a music would have any bad influence on people when it's only a music. I mean, I can't figure it out. In a lot of the papers, they say rock and roll is a big influence on juvenile delinquency. I don't think that it is. What about the rumor that you once shot your mother? Well, I think that one takes the cake. Where does that one come from? I have no idea. I-I can't imagine. There's another one, you may not have heard before. Several newspaper stories hinted that you smoked marijuana in order to work yourself into a frenzy while singing. Well, I don't know. Elvis: All the attention I'd been getting got the studios interested in me. My first film was going to be called "the Reno brothers," I had a hit song out at the time, so they renamed it "love me tender." [ Cheering ] The colonel put together a huge premiere in New York City, but when the movie opened, some film critics took potshots at my acting. Still, the picture did real well at the box office, thanks to the fans. [ Chanting ] We want Elvis! We want Elvis! [ Cheering ] In the film, Richard Egan played my brother. And because we were both in love with Debra Paget, we ended up in a shootout. There's nothing else between us, I swear it. Well, go on, take him now, or I'll take him myself. [ Woman screams ] Vince? Come on, let's get the money and get out of here. Get away from him. Leave him alone! [ Gunshot ] Don't move. Just lie still. [ Weakly ] Cathy, where's Vince? I got to talk to him. Right here, Clint. Vince, I didn't mean it. I know you didn't, Clint. You don't have to tell me. Everything's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright. Elvis: I saw the film for the first time with my folks in Memphis. After the picture ended, I remember having to calm mama down. At first, I didn't realize what was wrong. She was upset and crying. Finally, she said she just couldn't stand to watch me getting killed up there on the screen. ♪ ...that I love you ♪ ♪ and I always will ♪ Gladys: In 1957, Elvis bought us Graceland, a beautiful house and farm outside Memphis.

Get the police. Quickly. [ Jukebox plays ] Elvis: Not all the fights I got into were staged. Around that time, I got in a scrape with the law and had to appear in a Memphis court. A guy at a gas station took a swing at me, I wasn't about to stand there and take it, so I punched him and got busted. The court finds insufficient evidence to support the charge. It's funny ... Once you start to make it, some people want to hassle you. The judge agreed with me and threw the case out, but everyone was still worried about my effect on young people. Next time I went on television, I was only filmed from the waist up. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big show ... A real big show ... With Elvis Presley headlining tonight. [ Screaming ] Here is Elvis Presley! We'd like to tell you that, to all the people watching, and all you people that are here tonight, that we really are thankful for all the success that you made us have and everything.

Wait a moment. I wanted to say to Elvis Presley and the country that this is a real decent, fine boy. And wherever you go, Elvis... [ Screaming and applause ] ...the guys who accompany you over there, we want to say that we've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you.

I want to tell you something else I have, which is my very greatest prized possession. And that is the red and white western outfit that he wore in the picture "loving you" when he sings "Teddy bear." And I wouldn't take a million dollars for it. In fact, it's insured.

You've been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the crime of manslaughter. Elvis: I didn't know if it was movies following real life or the other way around, but in the film "jailhouse rock," I was standing in front of a judge again. This time, I got sent up the river.

You are now in the army. You are all privates. That's the way you'll be addressed from now on. Private Presley, you'll be in charge of the group. Gladys: As I watched Elvis say goodbye to his friends, I kept thinking about everything we'd been through as a family. And now, Elvis was going away.

It wasn't exactly Graceland, but at least it was off limits to drill sergeants. When my mother's health took a sudden turn for the worse, she returned to Memphis. I took a private plane home as soon as I could get an emergency leave. Daddy was already at the hospital taking care of mama. Man: How long are you going to be in town? Vernon: When Elvis arrived at the hospital, I had the tough job of telling him it was more serious than we thought. When we went into her room, Gladys was real weak, but you could see a sparkle in her eye when she saw Elvis walk in. Elvis: As we left, I had this empty feeling in my gut. When I first saw mama, I couldn't help crying. Then she calmed me down, just the way she always had. I left there praying she'd get better, but she passed away the very next night. My mother's death affected my whole life. I loved her so very much. All of a sudden, I felt like my life had no meaning without her. A month later, we were shipped off to New York, our point of departure for Germany. I was relieved the reporters didn't ask me about my mother. Man: Elvis, did the other soldiers give you a rough time because you're famous? No, sir. I was very surprised. I've never met a better group of boys in my life. They probably would have if it had been like everybody thought. I mean, everybody thought I wouldn't have to work and I would be given special treatment and this and that. But when they looked around and saw I was on KP, I was pulling guard and everything like they were, well, they figured, "well, he's just like us." Elvis, what do you think about going to Germany? Well, sir, I'm kind of looking forward to it. I mean, just before I came in the army, we were planning a tour of Europe, and I got quite a bit of mail from over there and everything, and I'm kind of looking forward to it, really. [ Screaming ] Elvis: Arriving in Germany was something else. I'd never been out of the states before, except for one weekend when I played in Canada. It was some kind of surprise, the welcome the German fans gave me. I just couldn't believe it. It was as wild as anything back home. [ Yelling ] I was stationed with the third armored division about 30 miles from Frankfurt. Colonel and I decided I was in the service to be a solder, not a singer. But a lot of officers pressured me to perform at army bases. I never did. Sometimes we'd go out on tank maneuvers, and it would get so cold at night, we'd have to pop bennies to stay awake. If you fell asleep on watch, you could get frostbite. I rented a home in bad Nauheim, a town near the base, and I sent for my daddy and grandma to come over and live with me. Well, happy birthday, son. I was in Germany a total of 15 months. On my 25th birthday, just before heading home, we had a small party. While over there, I met a young girl, Priscilla Beaulieu, whose father was a colonel in the air force. She was only 14, but she made a strong impression on me. Priscilla: I met Elvis about six weeks before his tour of duty was completed. A friend of mine who knew him asked me if I wanted to meet him. What girl wouldn't? Elvis was real friendly, but it was all over so soon. As I waved goodbye, I wondered if I'd ever see him again. Elvis: After landing on the east coast, we traveled cross country by train. I'd been thinking about this day for almost two years. Now it was finally here. It felt great to be back home in Memphis. [ Screaming ] Colonel Parker organized a homecoming. He was back at work before I could even get out of my uniform. People usually forget you when you're out of the public eye, but the colonel felt we'd be able to rebuild my career. I kept hoping he was right. Coming home to Graceland was kind of strange. It felt great to be home and all, but it was a lot different without my mother there. Being home just didn't feel like it used to, and it was hard not to show it. Before I even had a chance to unwind, I had to give a press conference. Man: Elvis, there have been a lot of rumors about your love life. Did you meet anyone special in Germany? Not any special one, no. There was a little girl that I was seeing quite often over there. Her father was in the air force, and, actually, they only got over there about two months before I left. I was seeing her, and she was at the airport when I left. And there were some pictures made of her. But it was no big romance. I mean, the stories came out, "the girl he left behind," and all that. It wasn't like that. I mean... [ Laughing ] I have to be careful when I answer a question like that. Elvis, did you like the food over there... When you would go out? I never went out. You never ate out at the restaurants? I never ate in a restaurant the entire time I was there. It's funny. I either ate in the mess hall or at home. One of the two. In fact, I never went anywhere while I was in Europe, except to Paris. I went to Paris on a leave, and that was all. Can you give us any details on some of your future plans? Well, the first thing I have to do is to cut some records. And then after that, I have a television show with frank Sinatra. Elvis: Then it was off to Miami to tape the show. It's funny, I was a lot more nervous about performing again than I thought I'd be.

He must have run up some incredible phone bills. When I was 16, Elvis thought it would be great if I came to live at Graceland. He called my parents and assured them that I would attend a good private school as well as study modeling and ballet. My father approved when it was decided that Mr. Presley and his new wife, Dee, would be my guardians. Elvis never lived a normal life. He couldn't even go to the movies like most people. Elvis would have to rent the Memphian theater after midnight when it was closed. Fans would somehow always find out about it and show up. Elvis had a thing about Cadillacs. Over the years, he bought more than 100 cars for friends. I remember, in one day, he bought seven of them. He just loved seeing the expressions on people's faces when he'd give them gifts. Elvis was the most comfortable at home. I'd have to say the best times we had were when we were totally alone. We always had so much fun at Christmas. Elvis would have goldsmith's department store open up after hours, and we'd go crazy buying gifts for all our friends and relatives. Christmas was always so important to Elvis. Those were wonderful times we spent together, but most of the year, Elvis was away making movies, and it would get awfully lonely in Memphis without him. Elvis: For the next few years, I made about three pictures a year. By the end of the '60s, I had racked up 31 films in all. At first, we worked in Hollywood. Then we started going to locations like the Seattle world's fair. I always took my guys along, and most of them had small parts in the pictures. [ Cheering ] Woman: Elvis, smile for me! After a while, the movies I was making became so similar, it was hard to tell one script from the next. We'd always be kidding around on the set, and colonel Parker was up to his old pranks again.

Will you tell me why you're dressed this way? Well, rock and roll, wouldn't it? You know. Elvis first started it. That was the thing. He brought it in. I think Elvis is great. Man: What's so great about him? Oh, he's marvelous. There's nobody that can sing like him. I feel that if more people in the world would follow Elvis Presley's way of life, the world would be a much better place. Announcer: Middle-aged women are here to recall their long-lost days as trendy mums, and Teddy boys of years ago have brought their children to show them what it was like when dad was a teenage bopper. But where is this man they've come to worship? Is he a relic of the '50s? Will we ever see Elvis in person again? Elvis: After a while, I was getting tired of making movies. The scripts were so bad, I'd actually get physically ill. I guess I cared too much. Then we came up with the idea of doing my own TV special. It had been almost 10 years since I'd performed in front of an audience. I started getting excited just going to rehearsals. It was just the challenge I needed. The guys closest to me knew what I was going through, especially Joe Esposito. Esposito: 1968 was a turning point for Elvis. He was 33, and his personal life had changed a lot with the birth of Lisa Marie, but Elvis wasn't creatively satisfied with what he was doing. The special got him all worked up again. Elvis really wanted to show the public he was a lot more of an entertainer than they'd been seeing in his films, but I knew he also had his doubts. [ Playing melody ] That's it, man. Well, see you guys tomorrow. Man: So long, Elvis. Whenever. Announcer: Welcome to NBC and the "Elvis Presley special." [ Cheers and applause ] And here's Elvis Presley.

The best thing happening in my life then was my new girlfriend, Linda Thompson. Thompson: I met Elvis at a time when he really needed someone to be with. Living with him was pretty strange. I used to say it was a nice, abnormal life we were leading. We'd sleep during the day, then stay up all night. Over the 4 1/2 years we were together, I could see Elvis was slowly losing some of his passion for life. One of the only things he enjoyed anymore was practicing karate was his bodyguards.

A sign that Elvis is, in fact, here is the aluminum foil that covers his windows to deflect the sun. A spokesman for baptist memorial says Presley has been admitted for exhaustion. However, private sources tell me the singer is suffering from glaucoma and stomach problems, including an ulcer. These problems have apparently led to Presley's increased dependency on prescribed medication. A few of Elvis' entourage are with him here, including his girlfriend, former miss Tennessee Linda Thompson. Our cameras spotted Linda in the hospital's gift shop today. She was wearing a robe that matched the singing idol's. On the 15th floor, we managed to catch Elvis and Linda strolling together at the end of the hallway near his suite, guarded by an around-the-clock security man. We asked some local Memphians how they feel about our most famous citizen's legal and medical problems. Well, if you don't mind me saying so, I don't think Elvis has really been happy since he and Priscilla divorced. He's been working himself way too hard. All those tours and playing in Vegas so much ... I think it's taken a definite toll on him. We love him and want to get close to him, but we can't because of all of his bodyguards. I think they're the ones that are getting him in trouble with the lawsuits. They're just bad news. Man: Sonny or Dave, could one of you tell us why you decided to write such a sensationalistic book about Elvis? When we wrote this book, it was out of bitterness and hurt, to start with. When we were given three day'' notice by his father and a week's pay after 16 years. We all had families, and he wouldn't talk to us himself. He flew out of town, and he had his father do it. Man: Why did Elvis fire you? It was told to us by his father that there was a cutback on expenses... Elvis: In 1977, I started to feel like things were slowly getting out of control. My health was a constant problem. But what really shook me was a book by three of my bodyguards. It hurt me a lot that they would attack me in public. I never thought friends who once were almost family would turn and try to destroy me. ...that it was because of the lawsuits. Man: Dave, you seemed to be implying before that you were writing the book, in part, to try and get Elvis to change his ways. You bet. We wanted to point out to him what he was doing, not only to himself, but to the people around him. And we didn't want him to be what he was. We wanted him to be what we knew he could be and had been. We were trying to present him with a challenge. If he saw all these things rolled in front of him and know that they were true, I don't know how he might have dismissed them in his mind. Maybe it will do some good for him, for the drug culture, for people to realize no one is out of reach of drugs. Here is a man that had it in the palm of his hand, and the drugs took it away from him. Man: What drugs are we talking about? Uppers and downers, sleeping pills. We're talking about things like Demerol. You actually saw him... Yes. My cousin red charged in to stop it one time. He broke the guy's toe going through the door and told him he was going to break him up if he didn't quit getting the stuff to him. Elvis heard about it, and he called red and Joe in. They discussed it for a while, and then finally he looked at red and said ... I'll never forget it ... He said, "I need 'em, man. I need it." We wanted more than anything else to see him as he was in his prime ... On the stage, just knocking them dead. Man: If you loved him so much, why couldn't you protect him? How do you protect a man from himself? Esposito: I whispered to Elvis to be careful stepping out to the stage. He was obviously way overweight, and despite his age, only 42, we knew he was in bad health. Through all the years I knew him, Elvis had taken great care to always look his best in public. It was tough for him, but now Elvis accepted his appearance and so did his fans. [ Drums beat ] [ Cheers and applause ] In this, one of his last concerts, just six weeks before his death, he still poured his heart out. To the end, Elvis' greatest gift, his incredible voice, never failed him. Thank you very much. Don't let the lights and cameras throw you. And don't throw the lights and cameras, if you can help it.
