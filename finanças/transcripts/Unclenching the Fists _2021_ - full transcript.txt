Ada! Adaza! Ada! Ada! Adaza! Adaza! You can hear me! Ada Adaza Hello? Ada? Are you sleeping? What are you doing here? 15th 00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,230 I am waiting. Are you waiting for me? Let's go for a ride. I have to go to the bus stop. Right near me! Let's go! I'll take you! Let me take you home. Not necessary. Come up, I won't eat you! Get your damn ass out of the street! Why do you always refuse? Not even if I have a chocolate bar? It’s cold, let's go home! The weather’s bad. Let’s go. -Was he bothering you? -No. I will destroy him! Come here! I will crush your jaw! Ada.! Ada. Help me. Come on, help me up off the road. Ada! Stand up! Get up! -Is Dad looking for me? -You're late. I said I'd bring you. Wait. Where are you going? Didn’t you call him? He's not answering the phone. Akim said that he might come. No, it's not that simple. Maybe he will come back in a month. "Vladikavkaz-Misor" Good evening aunty! -Is there another bus? -That’s the last one today. We’re finished. Let's go. Come on, let's go. He’s not coming. Why did you come to meet him? He can’t find it on his own? I need to. Don't you have anything else to do? Stop goofing off! We live here! We live here! -Dako, what are you doing? -Your socks are filthy! Leave me alone! Give me your pants! What? I can’t hear you! The pants! You heard me. Look at him! -Don’t! Stop! -Look at him! Adaza! I'm coming. Press it like this. Okay. Okay. Who’d you put perfume on for? No one. Tyra asked me to try it. Did she like it? Like what? I put it on for myself. I can't accept these smells on you. Don't listen to her! Adaza. Turn off the lights. Dako, really? You know you can't come to me. I'm still having the same nightmare. Can I tell you about it? I'll tell you anyway. Everything was bright white, and then black streaks began to appear, and I was a dot. The lines are wide and narrow. They tightened around me, I felt like I was suffocating. Are you listening? Then there was a white void, but it was even more terrifying. Dako, that's nothing scary. OK? Go back to bed. Can I stay? Go back to bed! You grind your teeth in your sleep. I won’t. -Dako! I want to be alone! -Can I stay? Then I'm leaving. I won't let you go. I told you before! I'll tell my dad you're going to the bus stop! -You can't. -I'll tell him. -Well then, tell him. -I won't tell him anything. Are you dealing with the sink again? Leave it. I'll fix it tomorrow. -Did I hit you? -Yes. God! The water isn’t hot at all! What are you complaining about? -How can I not complain? -You’re like an old lady. Yes! And the clothes haven't dried yet. Take your cup with you. I found this among your things. Nice fragrance! Is it yours? Adaza. Your brother asked you a question. It’s not mine. Well, then pour it out. Dad, it's cracking again. We’ll fix it. My hands are shaking again, son. That doesn't help. Dad, let me drive to work. I’m doing it. Give it to me! Adaza! Give me one! Here’s a piece of candy for you. What do you want? Here you go. Licorice? Be patient. Hey boys and girls! Whoever can carry their box like this, I will give a hundred rubles! What are you doing? Go away! Want a ride? I can’t go. I'm not allowed. -Let's go! -I'm not going. Why? How can I leave the shop? What’s going on here? Everybody get out of here! Get! What happened here? Bless you! Mr. Mars, why are you standing there? Come help me! Ada, let's go! I'm really tired of talking to myself, like a parrot. I'm not going. You're going, you just don't know it yet. You’re blushing! Tyra, should I go with him? So he replaces you with someone else tomorrow night? What a bastard. You look like he’s going to kill you! You’re dead either way, so it makes no difference. Give it back, Tamek! I said, give it back! Tamek, please give it back. Get in the car and I'll give it to you. Let’s go. I told you you'd go with me, but you didn't believe me. What’s in the bag? I'm going to the bus stop! But I'm not going. Then drop me off. I can’t hear you! Speak up! I said drop me off then. -Go back! -Leave it. Tamek, turn off the radio! Stop it, we're going to crash! Get back in your seat! Where are we going? I can't go. Sucker. Can you move please? We’re trying to get through. -I want to take a tour. -We’re going. We’re going. Why are you hiding? They will recognize me. And where are the windows? -Over there. -They won't recognize you from there. Hold on tight! Hi Dako, what's up? I'll be back soon. I'm coming! I'm coming! Wait! -Where did you come from? -The store. I called Dako. Good. You're breathing so fast! Set the table for us. You’re here! -Hurry up. Hurry up. We’re hungry. -How are you, Ada? -Shall we put the table here? -Yes, put it down. I’ll wash my hands Bring the chair with you -Do you want more? -Please. Do you miss home, son? No. Did you get married? Became a father? Akim. Why did you come here? Because he's hungry. I see. I thought you forgot my birthday. Ada reminded me. Thanks. Come on little brother, let's go out for a little walk. Ada, come on. We’re going to a BBQ tomorrow. I want some fresh air. Well, go get some fresh air. You can’t breathe at home apparently. Only Dad has the key. Can you buy me some candy? Can you open the door for us? How long have you been standing here? What kind of procedure is this? So they can’t escape. Here's the gas. Here's the brakes. Just don't drive like crazy. I know how to do that. Morek has a bike, too. Do you hear me? Don't drive like an idiot! -Show me how well you can drive. -Ada, let's go! I will be watching! How did you survive Rostov Road? I'm driving back. I missed you. Enough. I said enough! You’re dying, right? Are you dying? I am asking you, Ada! Are you sick? Answer me. Yes, I’m sick. You forgot, right? Of course, you ran away, and you live like we're not here! I'm running out of time. I can't stay anymore. Ada, I can't be in two places. I'm going to tear myself up. I didn't forget. I remember. Oh really? Where did your long hair go? You like looking like a boy? I like it better this way. Akeem, help me. Ada, let's go for a ride! Ada! Don’t mess around. Go ride over there. I tried to leave. He caught me at the station. He took my passport. He searches everything. I feel like I'm in prison. If this continues, I will break you out. You will be healthy and beautiful. Then we’ll marry you off! -When? -Tomorrow . No kidding. Promise me. I'm not joking. He promised me ‘when I grew up’, and now he reneges on the promise. I'm grown up. Look at me. Aren’t I grown up? Ada, come on! I'll drop you off. Ada! Why doesn't Daku go to school? What will they teach him there? Let him work the land here. You’d never think he was my son! It's time for Ada's surgery. She has scars forming. Your mom had surgery, and then what? Her condition got worse. Isn't that the case for Adaza? If it was, she wouldn't be alive at all. Was it necessary? She survived. She's alive. I don't want them to touch her body. They will reopen the wounds. Wouldn't it be better if that happened now? You’d let her wait another fourteen years? Do you understand anything? As long as she’s sick, no one will marry her. She won’t leave her father's house. Good for you, isn't it? You seem to have become a philosopher. This matter must be resolved. It can't stay like this. Why are you making fun of me like that? This conversation is over. Don't think she will forget. Look who’s here! -Zor! -How are you? Why didn't you tell me about this? Why didn't you tell me he was here? He came back as a gift to his father. A surprise! Hello, Akeem! Get out and let's see you! Here, I’ll see you in a bit. Go on! Hurry! Come. It's been so long! How old are you? Don’t fall asleep on the job! Too slow! It's out of fuel. We need to fill it up. Do you understand? Yes. She’s ten or fifteen years old now. It's like I've known her all my life. I am not a bad father. Right, Dana? But does Zor love his children? How does he support them? There’s an example. To your health! Ada, give me your phone. -Here. -Quietly. ...your children. Ada.The kids have drained your battery. Adaza. Where are you going? Want me to come with? Okay. Akim, what did you do in Rostov? Are things different there? In multiple ways. There are jobs here. I can arrange a job for you at the gas station. I can contact the manager. Mazuk says it’s the right thing. -Or you help with your father and brother, they aren’t doing well! -Yes. Family reunion! Tell Dana how life is in Rostov. It's a beautiful city, Alan. It has a lot. A lot of what? Of choices for how to live. Choices are a good thing. But you always want to go home. ...and whether you like it or not, everyone will come back eventually. -And the way back here is easy. -Simple. -Like Gatsal! -Yes! Gatsal is back! Not from Rostov, though. St. Petersburg, which is more beautiful. And now Akim is back! I did not come back. Don't arrange anything for me. Work, stability, marriage. So leave! -What are you doing here? Get out! -Zor! Don't get upset. We’re just talking! Just talking, Zor. Let's celebrate! I just wanted to say, May God bless you. May God protect everyone! -Get out of here ! -Don't get upset, Zor. Don't overthink it. Zor. Let's drink. Cheers. Come on! Where are you going? What about me? Are you leaving? No. I won't leave until everything is decided. We'll get you some papers and then go. Mazuk works there. I tried, and Dad found out. Let's just run away! Uhoh, guess who? Akeem! Run! Run! Adaza, get in the car. -I said, get in! -She’s with me. Where is her passport? -Don't give up on me. -Don’t be afraid. Stop it, Adaza! Stop it! Get in the car! Get in the car! Don't do that, Ada! There is no need for that! Adaza! Akeem! Akeem! Go get her. -Let's go. -I don’t want to. He doesn't feel well. Akeem, he's pretending. He's pretending. -We'll go to the hospital. -Home. Let's go to the hospital. Take me home. Okay, okay! Let's go home. Leave it,I'll do it myself. Give me your jacket. Get out! Quickly, do you understand? Get your things! They’re in your room. Alright. We'll wait for you here and escort you out. Get out of here! Where is her passport? Come here! I can’t live without you! Call an ambulance! -My phone is dead. -Take my phone. It's in my pocket. Bring some water! What are they saying? When will they get here? Hello? I am asking you. Why don't you say something? Have you called? Sorry. Idiot. -Where are you going? -I'll call from the neighbor's house. Let's just leave now. Maybe that's what we should do. How can you leave Dad like this? Suppose we didn’t see him. -You wish you hadn’t seen him. -Where is the key? Did you find it? Spit out the key! Spit it out! What are you doing? Akeem! Akeem! Look. I piss myself, like I did when I was little. Calm down. Ada, please! Ada, put your pants on. Lift them up. Are you ashamed, Akeem? Do you feel ashamed? You know how ashamed I feel. Maybe someone will help me. I can't stand it anymore. Let's get away. Help me. -Who’s that for? -Dad. Let's wait. What were you doing? Why are you so late? I hardly found my way home. I was walking and kept falling. You smell bad. They left me. Everyone left, so I started drinking. -Let's go home. -No. Not home. Daddy's going to kill me. Dad’s sleeping. We were waiting for you. -Oh really? -Yes really. We wanted to go for a drive. Akeem, why would you steal it from me? What a state you’re in. Let's go. Let's go dance at the hall near the school. Akeem, there are very nice girls there. Yes. Let's go. Let's go. -Dance! -Come on! Hold on. This is your jacket. Let's go. You wanted to go dancing. Dance. I'll wait for you outside. Dance! Dance! Come on! -What are you doing? -♪ The stars are shining in the sky ♪ - ♪ And the moon shines brightly ♪ ♪ And no one will understand ♪ ♪ Why are you alone ♪ ♪ Our destiny can be seen ♪ ♪ You and I met ♪ ♪ Let's have fun together ♪ ♪ And now we're part ♪ ♪ But when I close my eyes ♪ ♪ I only see you ♪ Akeem. ♪ Forgive me ♪ ♪ Because I made fun of your love ♪ ♪ Every day I just think of you ♪ ♪ And I only miss you ♪ ♪ Your pretty eyes ♪ ♪ I'll never forget them ♪ Button your jacket. Akeem, I want to dance. Let me go, please. Akeem, I’ll dance. Ada, give me some light. -Couldn't you have brought the key? -Looks like it's locked. Tomorrow, I will be dead. But at least we’ve gotten inside. -Do I look okay? -Excellent. Now, shut up! What kind of doors are these? I will sleep in your room. You go to my room. -Can I do that? -Who dropped my jacket? Could you, please? Could you? -Shall we listen to some music? -Yes. Are you coming with us? You scared me. Why are you lying here? Come here! Dad, are you feeling sick? Say something! Push! Push! He's obsessed with his mountain climbing. The girls haven't seen him since January. Maybe he died, but I don't know. Lay down next to her in bed. Okay? Understand? Lie down. Lie down. We will put the school building next to you. I’ll wash my hair quickly. The water’s still hot. Go to sleep! Go to sleep. Lie down! Go to sleep! Hey. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Why didn't you wake me up early? Working hard? Did you miss me, sweetie? I felt guilty waking you up. My daughters have magic fingers. I’ve never seen you look so beautiful. I shouldn’t have accepted. They didn't want to get dressed Where is your phone? Call Dako. -Is he looking for me? -Yes, he says they have gone somewhere. He called last night, and he wanted you. Are you going home? I’ll stay. Ada. Have you found a random shoe? I've lost one, and I'm looking for a match. -Are there any white ones? -There aren’t. I’ll close up the store. Good luck. Do you have time? Tamek, we're done. Enough. No more fun. Come with me. I'm going to see the boys. You are a stranger. Don't meddle in my affairs. Please. What do you want? You're with me because you don't have another girl. Is that why you hang around me all the time? -Do you realize that we’re stuck here? -So be it. -You should know that my body has scars. -I love scars. I've been collecting them since I was a kid. -Enough, please. -No, not enough. Sit on this jacket. -Show me who you're hiding. -No. -Come on. -I won't let you see. You are standing on it. Really! It's just a scar. I really do have wounds all over. That’s unfortunate. I have a sore that hurts. Can I show you? Here. I can not walk. It's like a nail. Do you see this? On my earlobe? I was peeping at girls. I got my ears stuck in the fence. And that's not all. When I was little, I rode on a donkey. The saddle was fell off. I bled like crazy. I almost got blown up when I was little. When the school was taken over, do you remember? I didn’t want to do this until the wedding night. I'm still bad at it. Excuse me. Faster. Nothing happened. It’s nothing. I will forget it. Sorry. I didn’t mean to. It's okay, Ada. Nothing happened. This sweater is a hundred years old. Calm down! Everything is fine. Wait. Where are you going? Don't go. Can you hear me? Wait! Wait for me! Nothing happened. Ada, don't worry. Nothing happened. Don’t be shy! Ada! Let me out. I don’t care about what happened. -Don't make a sound. -Ada. I said shut up! Ada! I was going to go alone. Did you really close the store? Ada. Ada. We were at the hospital. Dad can’t speak anymore. What happened? I'm tired. Dad. Where did you put my personal papers? Adaza. -Did you lock them- -Enough! -But I can speak now. -Dako, grab her. Adaza, that's enough. -I'll finally be happy, even after everything. -Dako, grab her. Adaza. -I have a fiancé now. -Adaza. - Stop it! -And I'm still pretty to him. -I'll cut my hair for him. -Get her away, Dako! And he will love it As for you... -As for you... -That’s enough! You will be alone. We're alike now, right? I will recover. Do you hear me? I will survive! What are you doing? Stop being afraid of me! Adaza! You don't need to heal there, but here. What will you do to me? Will you shoot me? Dako. Where are you going? Dako. I will jack the car, and you give it gas. Ada, help me. I can't do it alone. Please, Ada. Help me. Sit in the front. Okay. I thought you wouldn't come back for me. Are you going back? Ada, why don't you get out? You were watching? I'm wearing this backwards. The water is still very cold. It will help my ulcers. Give me your hand. Touch abs. Aren’t they strong? They’re still new. Look. It's the eagle. What? Do you swim with your pants on? Can you take me to your house? To where? Where you live. And I’ll say: "Dad, this is my love. And we're going to get married." Are you serious? You haven’t changed your mind? Tamek! Are you hiding that girl from us? We just got here! Let’s go! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go! Rip this off! I want to eat! How am I going to break his ear? Like the wrestler "Connor" or "Habib"? Calm down! Calm down! Don't scare the girl. -This is Ada. -Thigh or wing? -I'm Islam. Nice to meet you. -I'm Marat. Patrades. Nice to meet you. Aren’t you going in? It will make your hair will grow back again with even more volume! Be nice. This is my fiancée. -What? When’s the wedding? -As soon as I get enough money. Then it will never happen. Come on! Tamic! Tamic! Why are you over there? Tamic! Oh my god, you startled me! Take me home. We can't do this, can we? We'll have to wait, I guess. So you won't marry me? You know what my mom will say? "You are young! You must grow up first." Yes, we need to grow up. Guys! Patek’s drowning! Get him out! I’m back. Dad! Dad! Dad! He just fell with me. Earlier today. Be patient. We will go quickly. -Stay there. -I’ll catch up with you. Now it's going to hurt a little. Then you won't feel a thing. Be patient, it will pass soon. Lie them down together Did anyone excite him until his hands convulsed? I don’t think so. Dako, get some underwear. What is it? Nothing. I’ll be right back. Did I say you could? Let's see. Okay. Get up. Dad, I'll take her to the city. To a good hospital. Ada, get up. Let’s go. I want to get this over with. We are all tired. Change your clothes. Where is your passport? In the bag. We will be home soon. Don’t worry. Are you happy? Did you take these from Akeem? -Where are you going? -Home. Where did he go? Home. Come on. Let's go. Are you still alive back there? I can drive faster than you. We're really close. It’s not much further. You will recover. You will forget everything. You smell like Dad.
