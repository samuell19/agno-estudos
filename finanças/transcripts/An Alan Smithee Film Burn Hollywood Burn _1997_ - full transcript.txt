I WAS TIRED. MY MOM AND I HAD BEEN DOWN TO CHRISTOPHE GETTING HIGHLIGHTS ALL DAY, AND THEN WE'D GONE DOWN TO BULGARI TO CHECK OUT THE DIAMOND CROSSES, SO I WAS TIRED. AND WHEN BOB ASKED ME TO GO IN AND CHECK ON JAMES, I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT. BUT JAMES WAS JUST SITTING THERE IN THE DARK IN WARREN'S CHAIR, AND HE LOOKED SO VULNERABLE, LIKE SUCH A VICTIM. AND I WAS FEELING GUILTY ABOUT SLEEPING WITH ALAN SMITHEE. I MEAN, IT WASN'T LIKE SLEEPING WITH O.J. OR ANYTHING, BUT STILL... ALAN HAD STOLEN A FILM. THAT'S NOT GOOD. THAT'S BAD. I'D BEEN OUT WITH A COUPLE OF GAFFERS. WE HAD A FEW. I GOT BACK TO MY PLACE, AND I GUESS I WAS JUST ABOUT RIGHT HERE. I SAW HIM. HE HIT ME. LIES! BLOODY, FUCKING LIES! WELL, IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT. I HEARD SOMETHING BACK HERE. IT WAS REALLY DARK OUT. ALAN SMITHEE WAS OUT THERE, WAVING A STICK AROUND LIKE A MADMAN, AND I FIRED HIM ON THE SPOT. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SELECTIVE AT TAA. I MEAN, STALLONE BEGGED AND PLEADED WITH US. BALLOCKS! IT'S BALLOCKS! I WAS NEVER THERE. I RANG HIM TO TELL HIM I DIDN'T WANT TO RELEASE ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOVIE. HE ASKED ME IF I'D LOST MY MARBLES. "THE WORLD WILL SEE A MILLION MORE AWFUL MOVIES," HE SAID. "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF ONE OF THEM IS YOURS?" THEN I FIRED HIM. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE FIRED. HE SAID IF I GAVE THE FILM BACK, HE COULD GET REDFORD INTO MY NEXT MOVIE. I WASN'T IMPRESSED. I KNOW TAA. IF THEY REALLY WANT SOMETHING, THEY USE CRUISE AS THEIR BAIT, NOT REDFORD. STILL, REDFORD IS ONE STEP UP FROM HOFFMAN. LET'S GO, LET'S GO! GOT 'EM. COME ON! ALL RIGHT. NOW WE HAD TWO INCIDENTS THAT WERE VERY SCARY. FIRST, HE BEAT UP THE AD. HE GOT OUR ATTENTION. WE TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF HIM. THEN, HE THREATENED HIS OWN AGENT. I MEAN, YOU DON'T THREATEN AGENTS IN THIS TOWN. IT WORKS THE OTHER WAY, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THIS GUY WAS A FEW FRIES SHORT OF A JUMBO MEAL, YOU KNOW? OH, IT'S... THAT'S... WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? A PENALTY... A FOUL. "AMOK." THAT WAS THE WORD THEY USED. THAT WAS THE WORD THE MURDOCH PAPERS USED. THEY ASKED ME, "WHY HAS YOUR HUSBAND RUN AMOK?" AS IF IT WAS MY FAULT, MAKING THEIR TABLOID INFERENCES AND INNUENDOS IN THEIR MURDOCH WAY. I GOT VERY ANGRY WITH ALAN THEN. I THOUGHT, WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SPOIL MY SIMPLE LIFE? IT'S ONLY A BLOODY MOVIE. BAD SHIT! BAD SHIT! IT WAS TOP OF THE NATIONAL NEWS. IT WAS BANNER-FUCKING-HEADLINES. P.T. BARNUM COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ANY BETTER. MERRICK COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ANY BETTER. JON PETERS COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ANY BETTER. I COULDN'T DO IT ANY BETTER. ALL WE NEEDED WAS TO GET THE DAMN FILM BACK. [Alan Laughing Madly] ON THE LINE IS THE DIRECTOR OF TRIO, ALAN SMITHEE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? KISS MY BUM, LARRY! WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE. PUCKER UP. ARE YOU PUCKERED UP? YES. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS, MR. SMITHEE? YOU STUPID FUCKER. WHY? YES, WHY? BURN, HOLLYWOOD, BURN! BURN, HOLLYWOOD, BURN! YOU'RE GONNA BURN TRIO? WHY? I MUST. O.J. DID IT, DIDN'T HE, LARRY? YOU MUST? WHY MUST YOU? ARE YOU DAFT? YOU KNOW HE DID IT. DIDN'T WHOOPI WORK IN THE PART? YES, BUT TED DANSON RUINED HER. WAS IT JACKIE CHAN THEN? NO, NO, NO. HE DOESN'T SPEAK ANY ENGLISH. THEN IT'S STALLONE? NO, HE'S FINALLY OUT OF THE CLOSET. THEN WHAT IS WRONG? MICHAEL OVITZ IS GONE, THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG. YOU MEAN, YOU'RE AFRAID IT WON'T BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. YOU'RE AFRAID OF YOUR CAREER. I'M AT THE TOP, YOU SCHUMCK! YOU KISS EVERYBODY ELSE'S BUTT. WHY AREN'T YOU KISSING MINE? YOU'RE AT THE PINNACLE OF YOUR CAREER, AND YOU'RE GONNA BURN YOUR OWN FILM. [Whining] I SAW YOU KISS MARLON BRANDO. WHY DID YOU KISS MARLON BRANDO? [Jerry] HE WAS CALLING INTO THE TV SHOWS. HE HAD HIS FACE ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES. THIS GUY WAS MORE POPULAR ON THE RUSH LIMBAUGH CIRCUIT... THAN HEIDI FLEISS AND HUGH GRANT HAD BEEN. HE WAS BADMOUTHING THE MOVIE, THOUGH. I MEAN, THAT'S ALWAYS... SCARY. [Screaming] AHH! MOMMY! [Thudding Sound] [Jerry Yelling] MOMMY! MOMMY! ALAN WAS EVERYWHERE. EVERYWHERE. HE DID WHAT BOB TRIED TO DO WHEN HE WROTE HIS BOOK: BE EVERYWHERE. I'D BEEN WITH SOME NAMES, BUT I REALIZE... JACK, WARREN, EVEN HENRY... ALAN WAS EVERYWHERE. HE WAS TURNING INTO THE BIGGEST NAME I'D EVER BEEN WITH EVERYWHERE. I'M NOT A STAR-FUCKER. FROM WHAT WE NOW KNOW, HE WAS LIVING MOSTLY IN HIS CAR AND DRIVING AROUND. HE WAS EATING BOLOGNA SANDWICHES AND DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE 405. I DON'T KNOW WHY NOBODY PULLED HIM OVER. WE HAD HIS LICENSE PLATE NUMBER. IT WAS A BLACK RANGE ROVER, THOUGH. HALF THE WEST SIDE DRIVES THAT CAR. [James] WELL, WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING. L.A.P.D. WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE. RIZZO WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE. IT WAS MY IDEA TO GO OUT AND TRY AND COMMUNICATE WITH SMITHEE. I'M A COMMUNICATOR. I SAID TO JAMES, "YOU GOT A PRESENCE, A SOLIDITY, A PERSONA. GO ON TV. TRY TO TALK TO SMITHEE." YOU KNOW, TIME WAS RUNNING OUT. THE EXHIBITORS WERE GOING CRAZY WONDERING IF THEY WERE EVER GONNA GET THEIR PICTURE... [Moaning] PUSSY. JAMES EDMONDS, THE PRODUCER OF THE MOVIE TRIO, IS WITH US LIVE TONIGHT WITH THIS DRAMATIC APPEAL. JAMES? THANK YOU, MARIO. ALAN, WE KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE, AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN PAIN. WE WERE A FAMILY ALL THROUGH THE SHOOT, AND WE'RE A FAMILY STILL, AND WHEN YOU NEEDED OUR ADVICE DURING THE SHOOT, WE WERE THERE, AND OUR SOLE INTENT WAS TO MAKE A GREAT MOVIE. WELL, YOU DID THAT, ALAN, AND WE'RE PROUD OF YOU FOR IT. PLEASE CALL US. PLEASE. THE WORLD DESERVES TO SEE WHAT YOUR... YOUR GENIUS HAS CREATED. IT'S ONLY HUMAN TO BE DISPLEASED WITH SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE, BUT DON'T... DON'T DO AN INJUSTICE TO YOURSELF, ALAN. [Sighing] WE LOVE YOU, AND WE'RE PRAYING FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LATER TONIGHT ON ACTION 3 NEWS, THE PIT BULL THEY COULDN'T KILL, AND ANOTHER SEVERED PENIS FOUND ON THE SONY LOT IN CULVER CITY. HOW'D IT GO? FUCKING SENSATIONAL. JAMES, IS THIS MOVIE REALLY A PIECE OF SHIT? IT'S FUCKING SENSATIONAL. THANKS FOR COMING. I WORK AT THE BIG SHELL STATION RIGHT OVER THERE IN SOUTH CENTRAL. RANGE ROVER PULLS IN. DUDE GETS OUT, PUMPS SOME GAS. IT WAS THE DUDE, MAN. IT WAS THE DUDE! HEY. YOU GONNA BURN IT? OH, YES. ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE NO CHOICE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA KICK THAT PINK, WHITE, KHAKI ASS OF YOURS, RIGHT? [Laughing] YES, ABSOLUTELY. THEY'LL HAVE NO CHOICE. LET ME ASK YOU. YOU STILL GOT THAT STICK, DUDE? YEAH. IT'S AFRICAN. IT PROTECTS ME. WANNA SEE IT? IT'S IN THE VEHICLE. IT'S LOVELY, ISN'T IT? IT'S COOL. NICE. YEAH. WOULD YOU LIKE IT? HERE, TAKE IT. NO, MAN. IT'S YOUR STICK. YEAH. - I'M NOT REALLY AFRICAN. - AROUND HERE YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS. WELL, I STILL HAVE MY HOLY ROCK. - COME ON, DUDE. MAN, LET'S GO GET SOME RIBS, HUH? - YEAH. SO WHEN HE WAS DONE, I TELL HIM, "YOU THE LUCKIEST WHITE BOY THAT'D EVER DIE." HE SAID, "OH, NO, NOT ME. I FUCKED MYSELF." I SAID, "NAH, MAN. YOU COMIN' WITH ME. WE GONNA HIDE YOU OUT." HE SAID, "YOU NOT GONNA TAKE MY FILM CANS, IS YOU?" I SAID, "NAH, MAN. I CAN DIG. I'M... " "AN ACTOR," HE SAYS. I LOOK AT HIM AND REALIZE, WELL, CERTAINLY HE IS. THIS IS LOS ANGELES. EVERYONE'S AN ACTOR. SO I TELL HIM ABOUT THE FAMILY. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN GUERILLA FILM FAMILY. WE CAN DIG THAT. ART. INTEGRITY VERSUS THE SYSTEM. THE STUDIOS. BABY BACK RIBS WITH HOT SAUCE. MMM. BLACK-EYED PEAS AND COLLARD GREENS. [James] I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS FORMING A TERRORIST ALLIANCE WITH THE SCHVARTZES... UH, AFRICAN AMERICANS. HI. OF COURSE, IT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED ONE WHIT HAD WE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS DOING. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D MENTIONED THIS. HARRY BELAFONTE IS ACTUALLY...

WHAT'S HIS NAME? WHAT'S HIS NAME? WHEN HE... UH, MANDELA. NELSON. NELSON. I'M THE ONE WHO SET UP THE RECEPTION FOR HIM. I USED SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN AND WOLFGANG PUCK. FOR NELSON. IT WAS FABULOUS. PLEASE TELL ME THAT THIS IS CAVIAR HOUSE BELUGA. NOPE. IT'S PETROSSIAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. GO GET HER. HONEY? FINE. YOU DO HAVE THE WIDE-ANGLE LENS FOR THIS? WHEN WE FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS WHERE HE HAD BEEN, I WASN'T THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED. I THINK THAT WHOLE TELLURIDE CROWD IS SUBVERSIVE. RIZZO FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS THAT MANY OF THE AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAD BEEN WITH SMITHEE... HAD ALSO BEEN UP AT TELLURIDE. ONE OF THEM HAD EVEN BEEN TO VENICE. VENICE? JESUS. BUNCH OF COMMUNISTS IN VENICE. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO TELLURIDE. I SKI IN ASPEN. ONE YEAR WE COULDN'T GET IN, AND WE HAD TO GO TO VAIL. DISGUSTING. VAIL? THAT'S WORSE THAN TELLURIDE. I TOLD YOU WE COULDN'T GET IN. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I WENT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU COULDN'T GET IN? YOU? YOU DIDN'T FLUSH. NO, I NEVER FLUSH MYSELF. BULGARI, HERE I COME. MR. EDMONDS. ALAN SMITH. EXCUSE ME? ALAN SMITH. FROM THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER. S-M-I-T-H. AH. AH. AH. YOU'RE THE GUYS WHO DID THAT STORY ON RYAN O'NEAL. WE SURE DID. DID HE SUE YOU? HE SURE DIDN'T. ALAN SMITH. S-M-I-T-H. HE SHOULD HAVE SUED YOU. I THINK I ACTUALLY HIT HIM. SO ANYHOW, I CALLED THE FAMILY TOGETHER. SMITHEE SAT WITH STAGGER LEE WHILE WE WERE WAITING. STAGGER PUT THE THIRD MAN ON. SMITHEE STARTED ANALYZING THE CUTTIN' SCENE BY SCENE, SO STAGGER STARTED TAKING NOTES. SO I ASKED HIM, "YOU LIKE SPIKE?" HE GOES, "OH, YES, INDEED." "DO YOU LIKE JOHN SINGLETON?" "OH, YES, INDEED." "YOU LIKE CARL FRANKLIN?" "OH, YES, INDEED." "YOU LIKE THE BROTHERS BROTHERS?" "YEAH." "THE BROTHERS BROTHERS. THE ULTIMATE STREET FILMMAKERS IN HISTORY? YOU AIN'T NO BROTHER AND WORD UP BITCH?" HE GOES, "I AM IN AWE. IN AWE." I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN FILMMAKERS. THEY ARE THE CUTTING EDGE, THEY ARE THE DRIVING FORCE, OF AMERICAN FILM. I WAS PERSONALLY AND DEEPLY DEVASTATED AND DECIMATED... WHEN CARL FRANKLIN LEFT US LAST YEAR FOR UNIVERSAL, JUST LIKE MOST OF OUR TALENT LEFT US LAST YEAR FOR UNIVERSAL. I LOVE CARL'S MOVIES, THOUGH.
