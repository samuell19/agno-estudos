- Mermaids live all alone in the deep dark water where no one can see. They have magic scales that shimmer and sparkle and light up the ocean. - Mermaids aren't real. - Yes they are. I can tell you about one. - She was lonely in the deep dark water so she swam all through the sea until she stumbled in a little town by the beach where some humans settled. Then she took human form and came up on the land. Can you see? But the people were scared of magic and when they saw her scales, their fears turned to hate. The land became a lonely place. She ripped off her scales until she no longer sparkled. She drew a breath goodbye and swam away down into the deep darkness never to return. - Hurry up, I'm bored. They will go in a minute. Seriously, I mean it right now. Please can we go, please. - You're an annoying whim fucker.
