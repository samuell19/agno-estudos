Please save... Sir, Chameli! What happened to Chameli? -Tiger took Chameli & ran away Where? - That side Did you kill the tiger? - Yes It is lying that side. Go and bring it. Take this. John, keep the revolver and other things in my jeep. Where is Veera? - In your room, boss What are you doing here? - Cleaning, boss Sit down, Ajay... I think that we should start cutting wood from the other... ...side of the forest too -Why? The danger of wild animals won't be there then. Are only the men in danger from wild animals. What about animals? Maybe you are right. -I think that it will be... ...better not to touch that part of the jungle. We also get good income by our hunting at that part. That is also right. - You will be surprised to know that... ...I have made my will today -Will and at this age? There is no guarantee of life amongst these wild animals. You know that I used to live in Africa before coming to lndia. My aunt lives there, Mrs. Seeta Mathur. She will become the... ...owner of Timli Forest Estate after me. You have made an old woman as your heir. She loves me a lot. I have no other relations except her. According to the will, you will always be the Estate Manager. Why are you talking like this today? Ok, Naresh, we will meet tomorrow Boss, am I relieved now. - Yes - I also thought so. What do you mean? -lt is five and I will get the city bus. Are you coming, Neena?- No, I've to get some papers signed I will leave by the 6 O'clock bus. Greetings, Madam, do you need anything - Nothing, do your work No! - Don't be scared, I will just call the doctor. Sir...-Teju, one girl is lying unconscious in my room. Till I come back, you take care of her. A girl in his room and unconscious at midnight. There are one lady's footsteps and a man's footsteps. The lady must be fashionable who wore high-heeled shoes. The marks are going outside, that means they have... ...not come inside this way... -Take the photo... The bullet has struck here and then come out Are you sure the pistol you saw yesterday night was Naresh's? I felt like that only. It was.32 model & Naresh had two like that Sir, I searched the whole house & there is no pistol at all Both the pistols have vanished & bullet is also.32... A rose... Was their statement correct? -Yes sir, the tribals confirmed.. ...that they were in that celebration yesterday evening. They were drinking the whole night - Put bucket full of water Sir, I got this hankie from under the jeep's tyres. Ladies' hankie and fancy ones. Can you recogniZe this? -No I forgot in this commotion, lnspector. Yesterday night... ...when it was raining, a jeep went by very fast this side... ...and overturned near my house. There was a girl in that jeep. Girl! - Yes, that girl fainted after the accident. She is in my house. I was going to fetch the doctor when... ...I saw Naresh's jeep outside and the bridge was broken. When I came inside and saw, I saw fresh blood in Naresh's... ...body. -ls that girl still there? -Yes What happened? -The jeep has vanished - What? The accident occurred here. -Here... The accident must have occurred somewhere else I saw with my own eyes that the jeep crashed here and overturned. It had crashed after midnight and vanished in the morning. Somebody has surely taken the jeep from here at night. It was a jeep and not a doll. If the accident had occurred... ...here, some marks should be here. But the girl who had that accident is in my house. Come, you can meet her. That girl has also vanished. Teju, where has he gone. I am not out of my senses. I had put her on this bed myself. Just at this same place - lt happens, you were awake the... ...whole night. Now take a little rest. And if you bring any other evidence for murder, it should... ...not be imaginative - It will be strong evidence, lnspector. Cigar's ashes... Stop... Where are you running? He stole all the fruits. He should be hit by the trunk he stole... ...Iike the washerman washes clothes. I've worked there too Tej Bahadur, take your milk. Oh God! -What happened to you? -Today I am not well. Then ask me for treatment. I've worked for a compounder too What is the problem? - I don't get sleep the whole night. But why? You get headache, stomach ache...-No aches.. My body is restless and l don't get sleep. This seems like a new disease. I will just think deeply. What is there to think? Just give me some treatment. First tell me how you sleep, on the back or front? -How? Like this... -Lie properly. Is this right?-Yes, but what is the use if you don't get sleep. How is this? -Not correct -Then how should I lie? Turn this side.- I don't understand, you only do it Fool, you roam with such a big pot of milk on your head but... ...can't you turn while lying down. Move a little. See properly with attention. What is this?-I was teaching Mowa how to sleep nicely. I feel like putting you to sleep permanently. How did this girl vanish from the house? Did'nt you see how she went? - Fool, not Mowa. I am asking... ...about the girl last night. -I don't know. Why not? Did'nt I tell you to watch over her. I was watching with both the eyes but her saree was... ...exposing her legs while she turned and I felt... So you came outside and slept off- I made a mistake. I have done lots of work but have never been a watchman. Do I have to fulfil that lacking of yours now? Then you take 31 0 rupees. -Excuse me You come and you go...Will you come tomorrow? - Yes. It is two weeks and till now Naresh's murderer is not found Police always delay arresting. After that he gets hanged fast. Please sit. Today Ranbirsingh and his friends came... First you spit your betel leaf -Ok, Ranbirsingh and his... ...friends want to stay in the jungle for one month to hunt. They will give in cash. I have said yes on your behalf. Was I right? - Very right! Has Naresh left any will with U -Yes, but Court's approval... ...is required, I will get that too. But the Court needs to see... ...the murderer - When you present that will in the Court... ...please inform me. I will just leave-Wait, come with me today Where?- See jungle's colours during the day, tiger's colours at night. The curtain will rise and we will see. Let me remain behind the curtain and don't lift it. If the curtain is lifted, the secret will be open Oh, my God! There are lot of sights in my curtain. How will you meet my eyes? Whenever I lift my veil a little... ...remember that you will burn. When the beauty is exposed... ...that moment is unique. when one loses his senses... ...one who is awake also loses his senses. One who has made me... ...also has not understood me. I have been made beautiful... ...and even the angels have bowed before me. Let me remain behind the curtain and don't lift it. If the curtain is lifted, the secret will be open Oh, my God! Wake up, sir. The dance is over. Do you know this girl? -She is the daughter of retired... ...police commissioner, Mr. Sharma - Mr Sharma's daughter She only dances in the charity shows to help the orphans Please listen! -Yes, whom have you come to meet? You! I have been searching for you for a long time. You were searching me. What do you mean to say? Don't you recogniZe me? That night, you ran away from a house... ...after the jeep accident, That was my house only. Are you mad? What type of accident- I took u in these arms But when I left the house, you were unconscious in my house How can you come to a girl's house and talk nonsense like this Are'nt you scared of the police? -I have no fear but you... ...certainly fear and that is why you want to hide the truth. Maybe you are also involved in Naresh's murder - Me... Yes, when my friend Naresh was killed on 13th October,... ...where were you at that time? -What nonsense? No one has dared to come till today to my house and ask... ...insolent questions to my daughter. Since it is a matter of your friend's murder, I'll answer you. My daughter was very much with me on 13th October. But commissioner, my eyes can't be cheated. That day the girl who had the jeep accident was your daughter. After retirement, I have no other work except taking care of my.. ...daughter. Do you think, I'll allow her to roam in the jungle... ...at midnight. That must be some other girl- What do you mean? Is there any other girl with the same looks? -lt is possible. How is it possible? -Dad, twin sisters can only have same faces... ... but not strangers. He is lying -No, daughter. His friend has... ...been murdered and people don't lie on such serious matters. Do you have to ask anything else? - Nothing else is there to ask. I am sorry, I had to trouble you. Mulshi, has the ballistic report on 302 come. Hello Ajay, come? Naresh's pistol was 0.32 and the bullet taken out from his body... ...was also the same. Maybe, he got killed with his own pistol Could you find that pistol? -Not until now. U got anything I got to know something else. I doubt Police commissioner... ...Sharma's daughter. -What? -I saw her only today. Her face resembles the girl who came to my house on the day... ...of murder.... -Look at this too On the day of murder, Kiran was there in our Police club dance. This photo was taken there. If you had not dreamt in the... ...jungle that day, you saw another girl. Surprising, two girls with the same face. Can I take this photo? -Do you want to frame it... ...and put it near the pillow? -Not such colourful ideas. My intentions are quite decent. Madam, today's letters. Don't be surprised? This is not your photo as the colour... ...of the hair is different. If you want to know who... ...this girl is, meet me at this address, Ajay Singh, Manager... ...Timli Forest Estate. You are here. - But what are you doing here? I am not what you think I am. I am Mr. Sharma's daughter. I know you are Kiran and hence l am surprised to see you here. And this is the same place, where the jeep accident took place. Today also you think I am that Jeep girl. But I've no complaints... ...against you. How could U know that there are two girls with... ...the same face but there are surely two girls -ls that so? Who is the second? - Wait, let Mr. Ajay Singh returns home. He'll tell everything. I'm very anxious to know the 2nd girl Even Mr. Ajay Singh has not found that there is a 2nd one Mr. Ajay has learnt that & he has himself written to me. That was to just learn whether you are the murderer or not. What do you mean? - Yes, if you were involved, you would... ...never have come to this estate during the day. So Mr. Ajay Singh believes now that you are innocent. When did he see me? I have not met him yet. You have met him and you are talking with him now- What? Yes, I am only Ajay Singh. That means, you called me home by fraud. Yes, problem was I saw someone like you then & see you now. My house is not special but allow me to serve you. Never. - Please accept my invitation, madam When I found you innocent I seem to have got lot of things Now I can't bear your anger. Please forgive me now. I don't know what to tell you. -Till now you called me... ...Mr. Ajay Singh. Call me Ajay now. One use for coming here is that U don't consider me a killer now Do you really care about what I think about you? It is a beautiful place and hence l could not wait in your house... ...and came walking here. -This is nothing There are more beautiful places in the jungle. Let me take you for a drive. Please come. The sparrow's children -They're so beautiful Give me one or two children for nurturing them. What? -I meant the sparrow's children- I will just bring them Kiran, you start the jeep and run away Ajay... -Kiran, come towards me. How is my hair twisting on its own? Is there any miracle in rice There is surely some problem. How do I look like? -Like hot spices in style... ...cheeks are like tomato and lips are like carrot All these things are inside this. This is a magical purse. Let me also see. Letter in rose. Is it in my name? -Read and see. Na ra... Naresh tu ma... Tum - Read it fast I've read it. The name of one who writes letters is down. va.. ra.. Veera. This is our office madam's name. Did you steal her purse? -No, this is mine. But her name is written here -Do you doubt me? Did'nt I tell you that it is mine? -But name is different This is a strange puZZle -Then solve it. - Shall l? Veer means bahadur (bravery) and Veera is feminine of that I understood. I am Tejbahadur and you are my brave girl. You have united our names in this puZZle - Manager sir! I came without telling father. It is very late, I'll leave now. This time, your photo became the reason for our meeting. We need some reasons for meeting again- Not necessary She came on her own and went. Is she not unconscious today? Is she the same or another? -I will find out as I have... ...worked under a ClD also. Let me think deeply Leave your hair and heat some water for fermentation as... ...I have too much pain.- I will massage now & you'll be ok. Neena has left and her resignation has come in the post Where has she gone?- Surely not where Naresh has gone. But I don't know why Neena has left. There must be some danger. -You mean from the police.. No! Maybe from you. I heard that girls are found unconscious... ...in your house at midnight. -Do you have any objections? I am jealous. I like to play with danger, give me also a chance Veera, what is wrong with you? U never behaved like this before You also never used to play such dangerous games before Tell me, how was that jeep girl? - I don't know It would have been easy to find You could've looked in her... ...handbag. You might have got her visiting card & found address But why are you interested in her handbag? I'm interested in U. I wanted to know how far you went with her Do I still stand a chance? -Sit here and work. Whom do you want to meet? -The Estate Manager but... ...I could not take away my eyes from her first. Maybe you are the manager. -Yes My full name is Ranbir Singh and half name is Robby. That is why the lawyer took only half your name. Veera, take out the contract papers. He is Ranvir Singh and he will stay with his party in the... ...forest for a month. He has come for hunting. Please sign the papers. Now you can't get rid of me. Got a way to meet you by becoming... ...a stranger. - For your own good, you remain as a stranger Don't worry, I understand everything. Ajay had only signed two papers. How did this 3rd paper come? Are'nt the three signs alike? - Absolutely alike. That is my great talent. There must be some old papers here. Just show me, how Naresh's signature is like. -Why? I will make his will and make you the heir of all his wealth. Then, both of us will enjoy. - In the jail... When did you have the brains to think of Ur good and bad? That is why you were thrown away. Quickly give me a sample of Naresh's signature. You will never get it. - I will get it & you know, you can't stop me That rose can be anybody's but l might get a clue from hankie Ram Lakhan, bring water in a plate. - For what, sir? This hankie is our evidence and we can't tamper with it. We got it with dirt & we have to present it in Court like that. If we don't catch the killer, dirt will be thrown on our face in.... ...the Court. Understood! Let us present the dirt. V- means Veera. All my clothes are being searched. Then will I also... ...be searched, lnspector -No, we are searching for a small cloth Another hankie just like this. -Your search can be completed. Where have you kept hankies? -ln the shop and not here. By earning just 500 rupees, how do you live in this grand house? How? Now I live only alone that too in the nights What are your intentions? -The present intention is... ...that you stay somewhere else, in the jail in the days & also nights No hankies were found -Now also will U fulfil ur intentions Yes, my intentions are strong. This hankie can be killer's... ...and also can be yours. V- means Veera. Come... Bombay High on 5th October, what did the hotel manager... ...say over the phone? -8th October That means five days before the murder. Come, we were just going to call you, Ajay - Why? Do you want to arrest me along with Veera? Relax, come with me. The culprit has surrendered herself. A lone woman who... ...Iived in Africa for 21 yrs and returned to lndia 5 days... ...before the murder. -But what is her enemity with Naresh? Says that Naresh spoiled her niece's life who is dear to... ...her like a daughter and hence she murdered her. That is the problem. She neither reveals her niece's name... ...nor her address. She is that old lady. Do you recogniZe her? -Have you ever seen her... ...near Naresh or near your estate? - I've never seen her Sentry, bring her to my room She does not look from her face that she is a killer. Has Naresh ever mentioned about some Vimala Devi to you? No, but he had mentioned about his Aunt who is in Africa. Ajay, how is the jungle? Is it still green or has dried as... ...soon as I was caught -Since the culprit has confessed... ...can I take Veera with me -No, I still have to investigate. Veera, do you know her -Yes, she is a woman. Do you know this problematic girl, Vimaladevi? - No Again I would ask you about your niece. What is her name? I can't tell you as her repute is under stake. - How is it? If it is known that Naresh had spoiled her life and I have... ...murdered him, then who will marry her. Sir, we have got Vimala devi's luggage from the hotel. We got some slippers also and hankies. The same type of hankies with the same letter. V- for Vimala. I told you before only that the hankie is mine. Please sit down. On the day of the murder, was your niece also with you. I can't tell you as it is a matter of her repute. Did you wear high-heeled slippers when you went to... ...Naresh's house on that night. -Yes - How was that? You have the habit of wearing normal slippers which were... ...only found in your room. - l am wearing that slippers now. Are these slippers yours or have you taken your niece's slippers... ...after the murder to take her blame on your name. One idea. You make her run a lot with these slippers. If she slips... Where is the pistol with which you committed the murder? When you have surrendered, why do you want to hide the pistol? I can't tell you as my niece's repute...-... is at stake She is repeating the same like a parrot. -Will you be quiet? What are you seeing? - You! -What did you see in me? Innocence - Is it? That day l looked like a killer to you. You are still the killer of my heart. - Let us go What happened? -My eyes... -Shall I see? There is nothing...You were acting and made me a fool The hunter has himself become the hunt in your beauty I have become restless in your love. I came to hunt but got hunted instead. When I saw you nearby, I lost my heart. Your style has completely hit me. I am attracted by each style of yours. I came to hunt but got hunted instead. Your eyes are telling about love You are surely searching for someone I have found this secret and became close to you I came to hunt but got hunted instead. I lost my senses and don't know where I am? This is called love, my dear I have been struck by your love I came to hunt but got hunted instead. Greetings, Manager sir -Are you hurt? - No, sir We just came out to roam -Yes, sir - Come, Kiran. I am in a dilemma for a long time. Shall I tell or not? What are you doing here?-Dad.. -I told you never to come... ...this side, come home Inspector Rai here -Rai, I am Sharma - How are you? I heard that a woman has surrendered for Naresh's murder Who is that? - She has come from Africa and does not... ...reveal anything about herself. - Why not? I doubt that she is taking her niece's blame on her head. If we can find her niece, the whole case will be solved. How are you interested in this case suddenly? As I am an old policeman... Very few murderers surrender... ...themselves to the police. This is an interesting case. The signatures are here. Robby, what did you take out from that cabinet? Keys to our dream through which the whole property will be ours. Fool, do you want the police to doubt me again. How is that? -Police are still searching for a reason for... ...Naresh's murder. If you make a will, police will think that... ...I have only killed him for the sake of property. Don't worry, since the old woman has taken the blame on her head... ...she'll have to hang now-When did U become so stone-hearted From the time I hoped to become a millionaire- Give that paper It will go here. -Never, Robby -Don't fight unnecessarily. Robby...-What is wrong with you? Are you more powerful? How is this power? -Less than me No, Ajay, forgive him for my sake Now only you were abusing him. Then why this sympathy? Are you jealous? -Robby, go away from here. - Ok Tell the truth about your relation with him -I'm connected to you. I did not want you to murder because of me. What is this, Ranbir Singh? is this Naresh's signature? - 100% He has written all the property in Veera's name. Read properly. Why are you acting like a chameleon? You call me a Nag as I will protect Naresh's property like... ...a snake. - Then Nagraj, get that property for Veera soon. Why are you hurrying so much? Have you got Veera in Ur hands? I will fill your hands also with money, if you so wish. Shall we go? We will present this will in Court today. Definitely. Immediately I will call the police - Why? Police will take you to the jail with this false will. How can you call this a false will? Do you have eyes or not? Can't you recogniZe Naresh's signature? I recogniZe it, but you don't recogniZe me. Go and see the board outside. Satyamurthy stands for truth. I will present the real will and not the false will. Which true will? -Naresh's real will is locked inside that alimirah If Naresh had made any other will, news would have spread. Where was the time to spread it? He wrote the will in the... ...morning and got killed in the night. - Then this will... This is false and you are a fraud and talked of bribing me. I am sorry to have made that mistake- Don't repeat this. You will fill only my hands. Talk about filling the locker. -That means you're my partner You delayed so long in coming -Why did you call me? Is it necessary to tell? -No, I will go away. Why, have you lost the interest in the murder now? Did you find anything about the murderer? - Yes Who is the murderer? - Present in this same house. I am ready to give my life for such a long time, but... ...the fellow is not coming near at all. Please come near me. Where are your thoughts? Meet my eyes with your eyes. Where are your thoughts? See this side also, my dear love This time won't come often, where are you lost, dear? I am lying on your way. Take as much as you wish. Your troubles are also sweet. Trouble me as much as you wish My innocent heart is yearning. Will be difficult if u don't agree? How much can I explain to you? Become mine, my killer Please come near me. Where are your thoughts? Meet my eyes with your eyes. Where are your thoughts? Naresh Mathur, 12th October. That means this envelope.. ...was sent to Naresh one day before the murder. Where are your thoughts? Life is behind you or in front Why do you worry about the dead? Leave it Leave this acting. You called me here to give this envelope. I got that book from Naresh's library only yesterday. I did'nt know that this envelope was inside that book.-Don't act. Where is the letter inside this envelope? -Not with me You can search if you wish. -My constables do that work. You are fully ice. I will get some hot thing to melt you. The same handwriting, sir. -That means our old commissioner... ...wrote this letter to Naresh. And these shoe marks of a man... No, I want to speak with Mr.Bose, Fingerprint expert. I am Sharma. What happened to your report? It is so long since I sent you the sample of the finger-print. The same finger-prints are there on the pistol. No, don't send it by parcel. I am immediately coming to Delhi Why are you going to Delhi? -Some work has come about. To bring something- Till I come back, you don't go out of house. Why not? -You ask too many questions. Come, Madam. Sir has ordered to release you. Sir, will it be proper to release that woman? Till now, we have not found any other killer. To find the killer, we have to find her niece. The niece and aunt can't enquire about each other in the jail. You feel that the real murderer is her niece. Don't give the passport to Vimaladevi now. Keep a watch over where she goes and whom she meets... ...for all 24 hours. Are you still there? come up. Nobody can see us here. If I come up, who will look after your cows They won't go anywhere You come up. Why is the pistol here?-Again you stopped. come fast.. See the sweet grapes I got for you. Eat it. This is not the time to eat but the time to think. Fruits and flowers are only found on trees. How did this pistol come here? Are there more? Why are you feeding with your hands? Am I a kid? God, which fool have I got stuck with? He neither knows to love nor wants to learn. Till when do I break my head? -Don't break your head I know everything about love. I worked under Majnu also Who is that? - He is the master of love Then you should know everything about love, romance, union etc. I know only about mango juice Have had it also many times? Fool, there is great fun in the union of two. Father... -Rogue, get down. -Why? Get down. -Don't try to order, fatso Why has your dad gone to Delhi? -I don't know. When I asked, he changed the topic. Maybe some secret matter. Great! These old men never reveal their secrets but... ...are always anxious to know the secrets of the youth. That day he came till the jungle. -Yes, he was very angry... ...after reaching home-Why? -He fears that we will... We will... -This is what he fears. He has banned me from meeting you.-But you did'nt listen to him I have listened to him always, but..-The heart does'nt listen. Yes, that is the difficulty - Dad only orders once in a while. But this heart compels me every moment. How long we can avoid? You should not avoid it and should listen to your heart. Kiran, you stay here. I will just come. Where were you till now? -What are you doing here? Waiting for you. -Were you searching for me in the almirah I was searching for the bottle, dear. Came with a romantic... ...mood from the house, but the intoxication was lost in waiting. Where have you hidden the bottles?- In your thoughts... Get up... - So much strength in your arms. Lifted me like a flower which I'm -You look like a snake to me. Tell me truly, what you had come to search for here? Only you, dear. You're such a romantic hunter, who would... ...not wish to like hunted. -Shall I take out the revolver? Take me into my arms. I am in intoxication. Please hold me. Keep on holding each other. I am leaving. Listen to me, Kiran. -When did the hunter get hunted? How many people have you caught in your net? See you! Kiran, listen to me. - Leave my hand. You left me outside... ...so that you can get a chance with her -You are mistaken. Her name is Veera and she works in our office. I have no other relation with her -Then, why was she in Ur arms. Go and pacify your lover - Enough! You are a fool. If she had come to romance with me, she would not have... ...been searching and scattering the things of my house. Oh! The petrol has got over. My queen, have you seen the effect of my call? Yes, I have seen the effect. You had to stop... Did you see the effect of my loyalty? Yes, I have seen the effect. Listen to me, Kiran -Go and tell your lover What relation do you have with me? Go to her. Leave my hand... I am telling you to leave my hand or else... If the love is true, even the time stops! The time may stop, but l will not stop. Even if the sky is very high, it will bow down. Did you see the effect of the blessings of the heart? Yes, I have seen the effect. Have heard that the anger of a beauty can make one lose his... ...senses. Today, the petrol of your jeep evoporated in ur anger Don't go that side. It is very dangerous there. There are many wild animals there Maybe, but not more dangerous than you. The clouds have come down to your feet. Don't try to fool me -lt has become your cover Have you seen the effect of the call of a sad lover? Yes, I have seen the effect. A smile has come in your flower-like face, which... ...brought about happiness in thousand colours You have seen the effect of the path of love. Yes, I have seen the effect. My queen, have you seen the effect of my call? Yes, I have seen the effect. How do I go to the city which is 20 miles from here? Now there is no chance. Whoever goes to the city to get petrol... ...will only get the morning bus. -What? That means the night.. You will spend the whole night in this poor man's house If dad comes to know...- He would'nt come to know. I will leave you in the morning. Come now- No... - Come Why are you sharpening that weapon, brother? Drink this. - I understood, U're giving me water before killing me This is not water but liquor -Then I won't drink. Before taking one into our caste, we make him drink liquor. But I am Kshatriya and can't mix with your caste. Won't you mix...Sharpen the weapon. What is this you are doing, brother? Am I your brother? I am Mowa's father. -Why are you torturing... ...me like this? My young age is not meant to get burnt to ashes. I accept to convert to your caste. Give me that drink. -Ok, drink. So bad! - Drink it... -So bitter... Do you know why we have taken you in our caste? All of you are wild... I did'nt mean to say that noone has brains in your caste. Tejbahadur's brain is famous throughout the world. Is this why, you are taking me in your caste? - Fool... If a girl from our group loves a man from another caste... ...we cut the necks of both of them -Why're you after my neck? Which fool loves your daughter? -What are you saying? I am telling the truth. You are forcibly cutting my neck. Sharpen the weapon more. -Atleast listen to me properly. Tell clearly, did you not love Mowa? Why are you nodding your head from behind? You may not care for your neck, but I care. Tell fast, whether you love Mowa or not? What is that? -Don't you know? You are lying I've never lied. I have worked under King Harishchandra also. Now your brain will be set alright under this sword. Open him... Fast... By leaving me, you have all called your death. I am the strong Bajrangbali... -Cut his neck... No, father. I beg at your feet. -Don't do any drama. I have also worked under a wrestler. Now tell me, did U see the speed, Sasur (Father-in-law)? What did you say now... Sasur? -Yes, I said it. Till I was mild, you were roaring like a lion. Again I'll say Sasura. I wanted to hear this only. Come and embrace me - Sure! No... No... Don't come ahead... Don't come near. Kiran, did you get scared of me? - No... Then, who was there in your heart? - I don't remember Then, you go to sleep. What happened, Kiran? -Be near me -I'm near you only. I am scared. Stay near me. Very much near me. When will we meet again? -Whenever we get a chance.. When will we get that? -Ask the God above. God... Your dad is there -Wait... Come inside. I see that your relationship with Kiran has come to a dangerous... ...situation. Tell me clearly about your intentions. Intentions are correct. But seeing this cigar, I remember that... ...when the girl vanished from my house on that night, a man... ...who smokes cigar had also come to my house.... ...maybe to take that girl back. -I have no relation with that girl I am only talking about my daughter, Kiran. I am also talking about her and you know this very well. I only know that when you came to see Kiran for the first time... ...you were searching for the murderer - I'm still searching. There have been many suspects, but I can't come to a conclusion. But my heart surely says that Kiran is innocent. She might be deceived by you. I won't be deceived. Do you want to entangle her in problems? I want to keep her away from even the shadow of problems. Trust me, I will always trust my heart regarding Kiran. You know that Kiran is my only daughter. If you deceive her... ...I won't leave you alive. - I accept the challenge. The day I deceive her, you can punish me in a way you wish. I sometimes smoke cigar whenever I am upset. Come and eat with us. -I have some important work today I will come some other day. How are you here?-Had to consult with you regarding... ...Naresh's murder. It's a strange coincidence that Ajay is here. Why is it strange? -Ajay had said some days before that... ...Kiran was the girl who was in his house on the day of murder. So, you have come to consult. Go ahead and do it. Sit down. Tell me what you want to ask. The day Naresh was murdered, he had received a letter... ...which was inside this envelope. Only the envelope, where is the letter? If I had got it, I would not have disturbed you, sir I feel that through this hand- writing, we can find who has... ...written the letter first. What do you advise? Stop acting, Rai. You know, this is my writing. I wrote the letter. Do you want to ask anything else? What did you write in that letter? I had invited him to come to the Police Club Dance. It is obvious that you did not have any deep friendship with... ...him, or we would've known. - Just a small acquaintance. Then it is surprising that you invited him. Heard that he was... ...a very romantic man. Did he have any relation with Kiran? I am not interested in answering such insolent questions. I'm sorry, but that day on the phone, you did not even mention... ...that you knew Naresh - I did not say it as you did not ask. I had asked you about your interest in the murder and you... ...said it was due to your old days..- As an old police officer... Or as a brother-in-law or as a father. Ask clearly whatever you want to...-That old woman only... ...repeats continuously that Naresh spoiled her niece's life... ...and so she killed her. This is strange, as the girl who has... ...been effected should have killed but the aunt came here. Don't get distracted. If you think that the old woman is Kiran's... ...aunt, you are wrong - But the shoe marks can't be wrong. At the place of murder, marks of a lady's slipper and also... ...a man's shoes were found. I doubt three women who... ...wear high-heeled shoes. But two of them have no close... ...relations with any man. -And the third girl... She is your daughter. The siZe of shoemarks found is No. 8 I think that you also wear shoes of siZe 8. You had come for my advice. I advise U to go from here now If you want to enter my house again, come with a warrant. I am sorry. I have learnt to be duty bound only from you. I'll feel very sad if I am required to bring a warrant to your house What did you say? Will the property go to Veera? But Naresh's will had not even mentioned Veera's name. What do U know? Naresh wrote the will & died the same night Naresh himself told me before his death that his property... ...will go to his Aunty -What? - I will send you to jail You are all frauds & want to snatch the rights of old woman I am not a fraud. Go and see the board again. Satyamurthy & Satykirthy that is the double Satya (Truth) I will double your face also. Tell the truth. Where is the... ....real will? -I told you that l have given it in the Court. Don't lie. I will break your bones. -Why are you wresting with... ...a man who fights cases. -Tell the truth... Who came to you with the false will? - Ranvir... So Veera and Ranvir Singh are in a combined conspiracy. That day Veera had come to my house. For what! As soon as Veera gets the property, we are rich... Why should it come to me? -My great talents... That will has reached the Court. - I had objected to it, then... ...why did you make that false will. I knew that you will not go against me. You will have to be with me -You scoundrel... You want to misuse my compulsions. Robby, see there. What happened, Teju? -Very bad custom, brother They first told me to elope with the girl and then they are... ...fighting with me.- Till you elope, how can you get married? After eloping with the girl, what is the need for marriage. That is our tradition -But why are you entangling me in that? This bag is very beautiful. Let me see it - No I'm refusing now. Is this any marriage? This is a fight. I won't run now- What happens in marriages in your caste then? In our caste... -Let us show them - It will be helpful. I am a beauty who shows love and takes away the heart. My one glance can make any man flat. Beware of me, one with hearts, as I am a danger. With a smile, I can snatch away anything with my style. I can have anyone in a moment. With one glance, l can make any man flat. I am brighter than the moon... I am like the fire. Play with my heart considering me as a flower... ..but I am a romantic butterfly. This assembly has become colourful due to me. My one glance, can make any man flat So only you people have come. Is Veera ashamed to come in front. Return the purse. -Put the guns down. That letter is not in this bag. Hey girl! - Leave it, that bag is not of any use to us now. Chauhan..-Yes...- All these photographs have been taken... ...from front. Which photographer was called for police club dance? Puri Studio...- Tell him to send all the photos of Kiran tomorrow Particularly the profile and the back poses which can help us... ... to find the truth about her hair-style. Master, I can't bear to see Mowa's admiration for you. What are you blabbering? - That day you killed the tiger. From now on I will hunt it. Just give me some bullets. How will you use the bullets? -I have a pistol. What is this? This is one of Naresh's pistol. Where did you get it? Tell me where you got it? -I got it in a tree Tell the truth fast or I will break your face There is a jungle nearby, and a tree there which has a hole... ...in which I found this pistol. Have'nt I told you fast? Ok, come and show the tree. So the commissioner has taken away all his daughter's photos He gave a big amount and also took the negatives - Is it? Why not? He has been our teacher. Listen, find out about the man who was dancing with Kiran... ...on that night. -Ok. This is wonderful. This proves that Veera only killed Naresh. The whole doubt is on her now. This should go to lnspector Rai. Please send this bag also to lnspector Rai as this... ...Ietter was inside this bag. Do you recogniZe this bag? -No... This bag was found by a tribal girl near my house... ...where the jeep accident took place. That day, Veera must... ...have searched my house for this bag only so that... ...she will get this letter -lt is possible. Veera is very clever. I doubt that she only gave your letter to Rai. Did she give it. Was'nt the envelope found when Naresh's house was.. ...searched.- No, I was present then and no envelope was found Except Veera, noone is there, who could give this to lnspector. I understood. She wanted to divert the doubts towards us. Now there will be more doubts, when Veera will tell the... ...truth about whose purse this is. You are smoking cigars again in your worry. You know very well that this bag belongs to Kiran. Trust me. I've told you before also that I will save Kiran... ...from every difficulty. Tell me the truth about that night. Then listen... Ms. Kiran danced with me only once. I can never forget it in life Was there a red rose in her hair? - That is a minor matter Ask me something else. Ask for her lipstick shade or... ...her perfume which is still lingering in my breath. I can even tell her body temperature...98.4 Was there a red rose in her hair or not? - Yes... This is the matter. If lnspector Rai comes to know of this... ...he will immediately come with a warrant- That is my fear. Rai doubts that Kiran is Vimala's niece. Rai may find some other evidence. We have to find... ...the real killer as soon as possible. Are you sure that Kiran is not guilty? - I am sure. Kiran will give proof of her innocence today only I have told the plan to the tribals. You stopped talking as soon as you saw me. Is this something, I should not know. - Nothing like that, Kiran There is something which is being hidden. I was abusing you. I have to go a long way for reaching my goal and hence... ...there may be a delay in bringing Kiran- That is ok. Go, daughter -Thank you, sir Nagraj, get the wealth fast as there is itching in my hands. Is'nt your neck itching? U won't get wealth but handcuffs soon. Why? Was there any problem? -lt will occur, as a religious... ...man like me also drowns with you. What'll the people say... ...about my name Satyamurthy and Satyakirthy? Say clearly, old man. What happened? - Go away I have also got stuck by giving your forged will in the Court I can't even take it back. Ajay knows that it was a false will He said, he will take care of me in the big Court. Don't fear. We won't lose the game we are winning. Before he takes you on, I will kill him. From the time, I met you... ...there is current in every nerve of mine. Come on, my dear... ...as I can't control my youth. Both my eyes have become like roses... ...and I walk as if I am a drunkard. How do I reveal the secrets of my heart? Read my face like a book. I have mingled in your colours. I have understood the words of love. You also understand, my love Why I have dressed up so well today? The path is new and I am scared Come in front and hold my hands. I should not lose myself in your search. If I get you, my destiny will awaken. What happened? Why did she faint? Get water fast. - I have understood. Take these shoes, Master. -Shall I hit your head with them No, make her smell it. She will immediately come to her senses You just get lost from here. Kiran, what happened? How are you? I fell as if in my brains... -As if... Some things are coming to my mind but stopping somehow. Come with me. You go and change clothes in the hut. You continue your work, after I go. Understood..-Yes What is the work? Where did you bring me? -This is Timli Estate's house You rest for sometime here. I will just bring the jeep - No... I am feeling scared. - But there is no danger here. I will be back in 10-15 minutes. No...Don't come near me, Naresh -lt is me, Kiran Leave me, I won't marry you. -What happened, Kiran? Come to your senses. I had to do this deliberately to bring back your memory. Your father told me only today that you have lapses in memory Sometimes, such dangerous mishaps occur in a man's life... ...that he forgets that mishap & also the people connected to it. Please try to remember what happened before jeep accident... ...that night. Tell me... Just now you took Naresh's name You definitely knew Naresh. Your father thinks that you... ...can live peacefully only if you forget Naresh's mishap. That is why he never mentioned this to you and kept saving you Now your dad also can't save you. Police doubt that you only... ...killed Naresh. - Me... -To prove yourself innocent... ...you have to remember that mishap. Put some pressure on... ...your brain and try to remember it. What happened that night? Naresh has not come yet He would not have got leisure from his pleasures. You should not blame anyone unnecessarily. You have just met him before some weeks. What do you know about him? -He is absolutely characterless. Only today one girl called up and told me-Must've said in jealousy Naresh is a very rich man. Many girls want to marry him When some girl must have come to know that he is becoming... ...my son-in-law...- What? -Yes daughter, yesterday l... ...have promised to him. -Without asking me... I will surely find out the truth about him today & right now. Naresh, you had promised that you will marry me. Now I understand that those promises were for fulfilling... ...your lust. I have read Commissioner Sharma's letter. You are becoming his son-in-law & going to the Police party today I will also come there to take revenge for your cheating. Kiran, you here... ...at such late night. Who was that girl? -I don't know her well myself I met her in the party. She said that she is staying in the... ...nearby estate for some days. I took lift from her. She also gave her hankie to you for wiping her lipstick in Ur face You doubt unnecessarily, Kiran. I love only you. Your dad has also accepted for our marriage. That is why I came here. If he also sees proof of your... ...Ioose character, it will be good. - What proof? The letter in your bedroom. I will take it with me. Tonight, you take a sweet experience with you. Such an experience, which will compel you to marry only me. Don't come ahead -Let me see, how you refuse to marry me... ...after that experience. -No, Naresh... Whichever girl I have desired for till today, I have surely got her. This much anger... I have been searching for a girl like you... ...for ages. Now I will surely marry you. Leave me. I will never marry you... Leave me, I say -I am your lover. Don't come ahead or else I will shoot you. Your hands are shivering and you can't shoot. If you are more stubborn, you will lose your life. I was under compulsion and l shot Naresh & he got killed I never thought that these hands will be filled with blood. What are you saying, Kiran? I thought that when your... ...memory comes back, I will find proof of your innocence. But something else has happened. -I just wish that you should... ...not hate me. God knows what law will decide for me. But if I have your support, I will hang also with a smile. Kiran, I am with you and will save you from every difficulty. Where have these two vanished? Search the whole jungle. What happened? - It is me... I heard gunshots and... ...told Mowa that we will go and investigate. Kiran, write a letter fast. Robby, I think that those two have gone somewhere else. Both of you go to the roads fast. He might go to the city... ...by jeep. He should not escape alive. You two come with me. We will see in his house. Did you understand, Mowa. Nobody should come to know. Or else my whole plan will be spoiled and send a trusted... ...man to call the police. Reach this letter to Veera... ...tonight only. - I can go to the city somehow in a horse But how will I know madam's house. -Teju is there to help you No, she will help me. I will ride the horse as I am the man If all work is left to you, there will be confusions Come and meet me at the 4th block, understand... Yes, the one next to 3rd. -Yes... Come Veera, the letter you wrote to Naresh is with me. From that... ...you can also be a suspect for murder. Police suspect me also We must support each other in such a situation. Meet me in the 4th block at 12:30 today noon near the river The bullets in the pistol are over. Still you want to spend the night in the jungle. Your life is in danger here. Why can't we go to the Police Station? You don't know that they have blocked all roads to the city... ...and also my house. - Then let us go to Mowa's place. I have taken as much help as l could from the Tribals. I don't want the secrets to be spread to many as my plan may... ...not succeed then. -For my sake, you are playing with your life You can't save me. Trust me. I am the killer, Ajay You are innocent. Just think, why was Robby shooting at us. He knows that I got some proof. Either Robby is the killer... ...or he is with the killer. Listen, I have come to take my passport. I can't give it without the lnspector's consent. Can I meet him?- He has gone to Timli forest estate and... ...he will come late. -Why has he gone there? Not for roaming. He is a police man and has gone for arresting. Throw the stone. If you value your life, tell these people to put down their guns Tell them... -Throw the guns Take the revolver with you as it is empty. He has taken my revolver which is also empty-Pounce on him. I am sorry, I have brought warrant to arrest Ms. Kiran Tiger is nearby. How are you here? Kiran had written a letter and called me at this place. Police have arrested her. Let us run away from here Did you have to come at this moment only? Let us go back. Tiger is here only - What should we do now? -There it is I don't even have a revolver with me now. That day I hid the revolver here only - Where? Maybe in that tree... Come... Sir, he has got a pistol. He should not shoot really. Save me. I am a man and not a tiger.-Come my tiger. Inspector, this is Naresh's pistol which was hidden here after... ...the murder. The ones who hid it, have taken it out today. Veera, I have to arrest all three of you for investigation. Why me? Ask both of them. I had no hand in the murder. You had shot me with these hands and made a false will. Put the handcuffs on him. Move away. Ajay, you have spoiled all my plans. I won't leave you alive. Don't kill him. He is my son. -Your son.. And Veera is my niece.-Please take her to the hospital No, let me give my evidence first. Inspector, Veera is the niece whom I have brought up like... ....my daughter from childhood. When Naresh came back to lndia, she also came behind him. I learnt before some months that he was playing with her life. Then what happened? When I called her at her house on the evening of the murder... ...she told me that Naresh was coming to her house and... ...said she will settle matters with him on that night. When I reached her flat, she had already left with Naresh. I went to Naresh's house in a taxi. Nobody was there. I waited for him in a chair in the balcony & doZed off Today not me, but you will lose your life. Aunty, what have you done? -ln the darkness, I thought.. ...that he was playing with your life. Who was that girl? Whoever it was, give the pistol and go out now. We will meet outside after some time. Now you go. Veera, you shot at me. You won't escape now. Kiran has taken your letter in her bag. Police will suspect you. I told you so many times that I only killed him but nobody... ...believed me. Veera lied only to save me. She is innocent. Law might forgive but Lord... - Aunty... If God had to prove me innocent, why did he take her life. Rai, this is the second pistol which I had taken after murder In 35 years service, I have seen for the first time that the... ...murderer surrendered and nobody believed her. I am becoming restless in your love I went to hunt but got hunted instead.
