What exactly are you looking for, Mr. Warren? A pen pal? No, I'm looking to get married, start a family. Well... You came to the right place. I can introduce you to some beautiful Filipinas, there are plenty of them around here. But you're looking at the wrong book. That only has photos of girls from overseas. That's what I want, they make the best wives. Were you married before to a Filipina? No, I was never married. Cause you sound as if you're talking from experience. I spent 20 years in the Merchant Marines. I did a lot of traveling through the Far East. Do you have any other girls I could look at? Why? You didn't see anyone you liked? Some of them look like bar girls to me. Well, I think that's about it. But let me look at my other file. Maybe I can find someone. Or I could leave you my name, and you could contact me. You're in luck! Take your pick. These three look like bar girls too. Wow... She's beautiful. Her name is Dalisay Dimagiba. She's 21 years old. You know, "Dalisay" means "pure" in Tagalog. [speaking Tagalog] So we're gonna tear down this wall over here, right? And then this is gonna be the baby's room. Well, you know, when the time comes... Then once we're settled upstairs, Nick is gonna start on expanding the store. And then once Uncle Ralph moves to Florida, we're going to rent out his place. You're not having second thoughts about selling your parents's place to Nick, are you? No, no, of course not. The place is nothing but bad memories for me. The sooner, the better. Come on, it wasn't all that bad! Uncle Ralph, you lived above them, I lived with them, I should know. It's not going to be the same around here, you're going to California, and you moving down to Florida. Don't remind me! Oh, come on! No more noise, no more pollution, no more subway... [Sound of a subway passing.] Come on, peace and quiet. A great place to die! Oh come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm not being dramatic, it's the truth! You retire down there, you die down there. Now I don't know about you, but if I'm gonna die, I wanna die up here with the family, instead of down there all alone. - He's talking about dying again? - What else? Alma, what did I tell you about touching the blueprints? What? - Are your hands clean? - Yes! I had my arms on it, I wasn't really touching it. You gotta be very careful with these things, they're very expensive. I know, I was just showing it to Jan! Where do you want this furniture? - What furniture? - It's here! - The furniture's here! - The dining room set? - You asked them to deliver it? - Well, they called. They're not supposed to bring it until they finish upstairs, they haven't even started yet! But you're not listening, they called and said if they delivered it today, they wouldn't charge me for the delivery... - Where we supposed to put it? - We could find a place for it. We're saving all that money, and it came from North Carolina. - How big is it? - It's big. It's big. - Put it in back. - You got it. - Where the hell is your brother? - I don't know... Oh shit, it's late! I gotta get out of here. I gotta go pick up my kid. [Sound of subway passing by.] [Subway noise gets louder.] What about your brother? Ain't you gonna wait for him? I can't wait for forever. I got my own life to live. But you promised. You said you were going to talk to him, find out what's going on. Look, I got stuff coming! I'm starting to get worried. So what are you worried about? My brother said he'd sell you the building, didn't he? But I get this funny feeling your brother plans on staying in your parent's apartment. Yeah, well, he better not! Jan, your brother hasn't been around this long in over 15 years. Oh, it's only temporary, where else was he supposed to stay when he got back? "Back" was supposed to be for only a week. He's here a month already! I don't think he's even looking for another place to live! Jan, I gave a down payment to the contractor, I don't even have a start date. What is the matter with you? You couldn't wait until everything was signed? You, of all people, you know my brother! Please, do me a favor, talk to your brother, find out what's going on. Forget about me wanting to expand the store. Do it for Alma. That's all she talks about is moving upstairs. It'll break her heart if this falls through. [Sound of car honking impatiently.] Hey, where were you yesterday? Couldn't make it. That's all you got to say for yourself? I kept that super waiting for an hour! This is the last time! I convinced that guy to hold that place for a week so you could see it, and you don't even bother to show up? Look, it's not the only apartment in New York. Oh yeah? Then you find one yourself. Don't expect anymore help from me. You better find one quick. As soon as these papers are signed, I'm taking my kid, we're going out to California, permanently. You better not fuck up my plans! Hey, Dean! You wanna take a look at these blueprints? Some other time, I'm tired. [speaking Tagalog] You're Filipina? That's right. How did you know? I spent a lot of time traveling to the Far East. Your wife? Soon, I hope. She's beautiful! Trying to get her over, so we can get married. That sounds romantic. Yeah, I know. [Sound of door opening.] The shit's gonna hit the fan when they'll find out. Look at it this way... If I'm staying, so are you. Shit, it's no big deal if I go down to Florida. My life is almost over. You're just starting out. I know what this place means to you. The same as when your parents built it, it meant a lot to them too. And now look at! Sister... So bitter, she can't wait to sell the place off. And you know you who's gonna wind up with everything? The whole kitten kaboodle? Your cousin, Nick. The errand boy! Do they know about the Philippine girl? No, not yet. Any news yet? It's too early. Uncle Ralph... Go to the bathroom. Shit, I gotta take some leak! See you later. [Apartment door closing.] [speaking Tagalog] It's been almost three weeks since I received your last letter. I'm wondering why I haven't heard from you. I spoke to Miss Amador at the agency, and she told me that your visa papers should be processed soon. I hope all is well with you. Take care, and say hello to your family. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. Love... [Sound of door opening.] Hi! Don't bother to knock, just let yourselves in. Take a guess where we just came from? Surprise me. Our lawyer's office. Where else? Finally. Let's get all of this over with. Everything's down on paper, just the way we discussed. You're welcome to look everything over. Our lawyer looked it over, everything's in order. All we need is your signature. I've changed my mind. What are you talking about, "change your mind"? Change your mind about what? I'm not gonna sign. What do you mean you're not gonna sign? Exactly what I said. I'm not signing. I'm staying. I want to keep this place. I knew he was gonna pull shit like this, I knew it! You're signing. I need this goddamn money! Now you sign it! I'm not signing. I'll send you your half when I get it. Yeah, I don't believe you. We all agreed on this after you mother died. I spent a lot of money already. And what about Alma? She's expecting to move in here any day now. I don't know what to tell you. All I know is that I'm staying. You selfish son-of-a-bitch, you got one helluva nerve! You are not gonna fuck up my plans now, you sign these goddamn papers! Where the hell do you think you're going? - We're not through yet. - Well, I am. After everything I did for your family, you treat me this way! - You son-of-a-bitch! - Nick! [Sound of subway passing.] Make sure you close the door when you're through. Go on! Go on! Disappear! That's all you've done your whole life! Run away! Run away, and this time don't come back! Hey Dean! Look what came today! Thanks, Uncle Ralph! What's this shit? [speaking Tagalog] - Hey, Dick, how you doing today? - Not bad, Dean! Hey, Manny and Mo, let's go! Let me get in the street sometime this week! Time is money! Aye, aye, Captain! [Sound of hood slamming shut.] Hey, hey, Dino! You looking for something? That smells exotic! Looking for these, Romeo? Listen, what are you, the Two Stooges? Gimme the picture and the fucking letters, I don't have time to jerk off, alright? That's the best you can do? Come on, where'd you pick her up? Chinatown? Wo Hop's? What happened? Who is she? I gotta get out in the street. Give me the fucking letters! Take it easy. We just wanna know who she is. - Wanna play that game? - Whadya mean...? [Sound of Dean gunning motor.] Oh! Take it easy. We're just trying to have a few laughs. What are you trying to do? Kill us? Come here. No bullshit, does she do your shirts? Give me the fucking pictures and the letter right now. What if we don't want to give them to you? What if you don't? These your tools? Yeah, they're my tools. I'm gonna toss 'em in the East River, that's what. Don't do that, my Allen wrenches are in there. I don't give a fuck if you got your sister in there. Give me the fucking... And the letters. - You want your tools? - Yeah, yeah. Back up. I wanna give them to you. Back up. Have a nice day, assholes! [Screeching tires.] [speaking Tagalog] [Sound of rooster crowing.] [Knocking sound on front door.] Coming! [More knocking.] So, you bought a new lock? I hope you spent your money on a good one. I'm impressed. Remember these? I want you to tell me right now why you won't sign these papers. I'm gonna settle down. I'm going to get married. My brother getting married! I guess that means you want to start a family, too, right? Yeah. Why? Is anything wrong with that? Yeah, I'll tell you what's wrong with that. You don't deserve a family! What do you know about family? What do you know about this family? How sweet? I'm touched! Are you trying to tell me that you care for them now? You're a real fucking hypocrite. You didn't even have the decency to visit them at the cemetery. Look, don't walk away from me! Isn't 20 years enough? Don't you ever get tired of running away? - What are you talking about? - What about him? It wasn't bad enough that he had to drink himself to death, you had to leave me and Mom alone while you were cruising somewhere on the other side of the fucking world! Jesus, you couldn't even come home for his funeral! By the time I found out, it was too late. Oh too late, my ass! You were on some drunken binge with one of your bimbo girlfriends. Why did you leave me here all alone? This place was fucking hell taking care of that sick miserable woman! If it wasn't for Nick, we would've been out on the streets! I tried... I tried so hard to keep this place, but did you care? No, you never even stayed long enough to care! No wonder Nick had to take care of Mom's funeral! Shit, you couldn't even come home for that! I don't want to be part of your family. No, I just want to leave. I'm gonna take my kid, and I'm gonna forget all about this place. [speaking Tagalog] What do you mean you don't know where Miss Amador is? You're her secretary right? Well, I'm gonna talk to you anyway. Look, Amador promised me this girl'd be here 3 months ago, she should be here by now. She... Yeah... You don't understand... Look, I heard about agencies, you take people's money, they never hear from you again... Could you...? Lady, is this the only phone in New York, huh? What? Look, you'd better be telling me, you don't understand. I gave you every fuckin' last penny I have... Yeah, but you don't... Hello? Hello? Hello! Fuck! Go on, knock yourselves out! [Crowded bar noise.] - Fuck you! - Fuck you... Shipmate... Could you get another drink for this girl, this guy, you, me, on me, thank you. Just save your money. Don't waste it on me. Don't worry about money. I got plenty of money, and this one's on me. You could waste it on me? Remember me? No... And I don't want to. You wanna dance? You know, you're a real asshole!

And then, later on... We can have the wedding you want. What do you say? Your family doesn't want me here. Forget about my sister, forget about my cousin, forget about my family. You're gonna be living here with me. Here? Yeah. Where else? But you're not even supposed to be living here. I already explained that to you. Are you trying to tell me something? Can we just be friends? What do you mean "friends"? I just want to be your friend. I have to go. You're really gonna leave me. [Sound of door slamming.] Please, let me go. My cousin, Tess, must be worried by now. Fuck Tess! Sit down! [Sound of a subway passing.] You know I spent the last twenty years of my life, running away, drifting around the world... Being everywhere except where I should have been. And now what you see here is all I have left. It never meant anything to me, but now it means so much. So I decided to stay. And I'm this far away, this fucking far away... from losing my home, my family's gone, my parents are gone, my sister wants nothing to do with me! I'm hanging on to this place by a thread. And now, and now, you tell me that you're gonna leave me? I mean... Was I stupid? Was I stupid to think that I could find my way back home? Don't leave me. Marry me. I can't. What do you mean you can't? What are you talking about? I don't love you. Dalisay, you're all mixed up. What about us? What about our plans? What about our dreams? I brought you from the other side of the world over here... We've been having a little bit of a rough time, but we can work this all out. I can't believe that you could say that. I want you to look in my eyes. I want you to look in my eyes and tell me that you don't love me. I'm sorry. I don't love you. Can I leave now? My cousin, Tess, must be worried by now. [Sound of Dean kicking Dalisay's bag.] You know something? I am beginning to get sick and tired of your cousin, Tess. Would you like me to show you what I think of your fucking cousin, Tess! [Sound of a subway passing.] [Sound of breaking vase.] [Sound of more breaking things.] [Sound of Dalisay sobbing.] [Sound of breaking chair.] [More sounds of chaos.] [Sound of Dalisay sobbing.] [Sound of Dalisay sobbing louder.] [Sound of quiet footsteps on broken glass.] [Sound of cracking glass underfoot.] [Sound of squeaky front door.] [Sound of metal front door closing.] [Sound of iron curtain opening.] [Sound of a dog barking in distance.] ♪ [Theme music comes up.] Ohh... Dalisay? Oh man... Oh, shit... [Sound of cracking glass underfoot.] Dalisay? Dalisay? [Echoes in hallway.] Uncle Ralph? [Sound of the door closing.] Uncle Ralph? Nick! Come give me a hand with these boxes! Nick! What are you staring at? Come help me! [Sound of Dean crying.] [Sound of Dean sobbing.] Com'on Dean, Dean... Hon, what's the matter? [Sound of a subway overhead.] [Sound of subway passing by.] ♪ [Theme music comes up.]
