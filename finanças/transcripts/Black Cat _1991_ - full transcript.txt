SCREENWRITERS: LAM WAI-LUN, CHAN PO-SHUN, LAM DAAN-PING [ENGINE STOPS] ASSISTANT DIRECTORS: LAM WAI-LUN, NG KWAN-YUK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: CHENG SIU-KEUNG [DOOR CLOSES] [CUTLERY CLATTERS] [ENGLISH] Hey, Denny! Coffee! [DENNY] Hey, Peckerhead. Where ya been? Ten days on the road? How come you're in so late? Aren't you usually boppin' some broad about this time? Been hauling a load to a shithole called Rose Mount. Those women there are so goddam ugly. I dumped my load and highballed home. For a horny guy like you, that's some feat. Huh! Ten days without a woman! What're you gonna do now? Go home and beat your meat or pick up some old guy down the road? - Cut the bullshit and feed me. - OK, OK. Get off your ass, you lazy bitch. Jesus, I must have been stupid or horny to hire you. God's sake. Go look after my customer. Hey, sweetie. You must hate your job. You wanna make some fast buck and put some smile on your face? - [WOMAN GRUNTS] - Hey...! You don't like that? How about this? [YELLS] You vicious slut! What the hell's goin' on?

Cut it out or I'm callin' the cops! - Let me in! - All right! [DENNY] What is it?! What have you got? This is mine. Well, blow it in hell, baby. Asshole. [PLAYS TUNE] You can be quite a bitch. After a couple of blows, you still feel like playing harmonica. [CHUCKLES] You wanna play some more? - [PECKERHEAD CHUCKLES] - Thirty bucks to start. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. [BOTH YELL] [GROANS] - [WOMAN] Go fuck yourself! - [GROANS] You bastard! [SCREAMS] Jesus Christ! Police? Liberty Truck Stop. We got a problem here. I need help right away. Right away! We need someone now. Yeah, right now! Right now! You bitch! Wild man, I don't want any killing in the café. Lucky you! I'll let you go this time. Bitch! Oh no! Stop! Stop! - You crazy bitch! - [YELLING] [SCREAMS] [SIREN] Anybody here? Jim, check left. I got one over here, Jim! Go call the ambulance. [YELLING] Morning, Ed. So what happened last night? Why's everyone in such a bad mood? Haven't you heard? John got shot by a crazy bitch last night. What? I can't believe it. Just yesterday we were talkin' about going on a fishing trip. [ED] God. Hey, guess you'll have to find someone else. [OFFICER #1] Did you hear what happened to John last night? [OFFICER #2] Yeah, everyone knows about it. In fact, this girl that you're taking is the one who did it. [OFFICER #1] Where is she? [OFFICER #2] She's right over there. A brown leather wallet. An expired visa card. A social security card: 7-2-2-2-5-7-2-8-4. Cash: two dollars and 40 cents. Marijuana. Perfume. Caffeine pills. Underwear. Take your clothes off. Strip down. Spread your legs. Spread your legs! Hands behind your head. [GASPING] [BOTH YELLING] [BANGING] [YELLING CONTINUES] - What happened? - [EXHALES] It's Wendy. Hell, I hope she doesn't get us into trouble. [PANTING] You fuckin' bitch. [PANTING] [YELLING] - [STIFLED SHOUTS] - [BANGING] Wendy, don't kill the fucking cow. Think of the trouble. Oh, shit. Wendy. Come on, guys. Let's go. [SCREAMING CONTINUES] Wendy, Wendy. [INDISTINCT] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] You murdering bitch! You took my brother's life! I want him back! I want him back! [SOBBING] No! [DOORS SHUT] [REPORTERS CLAMOURING] Excuse me! - Back! Get back! - Catherine, you got a lawyer? As you can see, the suspect for the murder of Officer John Simpson at the truck stop on Highway 15 two days ago, is now being transported to her trial. We will have an update of the trial proceedings later tonight at 11. I wanna go pee. I wanna go pee. I wanna go pee. I wanna go pee. I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee. I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee! [YELLS] I wanna go pee! I wanna go pee! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] Stop! [YELLING] Stop! [YELLING] Jesus Christ! [SCREAMING] - Go after her! - Get her! - [SCREAMING] - [OFFICER] Stand back! Someone stop her! [OFFICER] Get her! [SCREAMING] [SIREN] [CARS BEEPING] [VENTILATOR PUMPING] [HELICOPTER] [BLEEPING] [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] [FOOTSTEPS] [CANTONESE] Who are you? [GASPING] [CRYING IN PAIN] Take this and the pain will stop. [PANTING] Are you a doctor? You could say that I'm a doctor because I saved you. But as of now, you're not a patient, you're a dead person. On 6 March 1990, you killed a police officer. You eluded as you were being taken to court. Due to the fact you are a murderer, you had been shot by the cop chasing after you. We saved you. We're giving you a chance to work for our government. We have implanted a microchip known as the 'Black Cat' into your brain. It will help you reach your highest potential. As of now, you are no longer who you used to be. Your codename shall be 'Black Cat'. [YELLING] [PANTING] [E] Open the door! [CATHERINE] Open the door! Let me out! Let me out! Stop! [C] This is your first lesson. You should never shoot at others' bodies. Aim for the head! [SOBBING] [PANTING] [YELLING] [BLEEPING] - [GROANS] - [SHOUTS] [E] Punch to my face. Ready! [SHOUTS] This is a.38-55 Winchester. Medium velocity, and generally used for hunting. This is.44 Magnum, the most powerful bullet used in handguns today. And this is a 5.56mm. Full metal jacket. It's a standard US military round. These two soft points will flatten out upon impact, causing a great degree of damage. While the full metal jacket has a higher degree of penetration power. Our ballistics laboratory has designed a new cartridge with a slug made of ice. It will dissolve immediately upon impact. It will not leave any identifying marks. It has an effective range of 200 yards and must be stored in -32°C. Once removed from the container, it must be fired within five seconds. Otherwise, it will dissolve. This is an example. [BLEEPS] [DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE] [BLEEP] [TEACHER] [GERMAN] What is your nationality? [CATHERINE] I am Chinese. [TEACHER] Good. Where did you study German? [CATHERINE] I studied in Germany. What is your profession? - I am a student. - Good. [E] Get me outta here! It's cold! Catherine! Bet you like the beach, huh? Your turn to get into the water. I don't want any steak. [C] Why aren't you eating any steak? I don't like the sight of anything that's red. [SIGHS] You want to meet new friends, right? For you. Thanks. When can I go out? How long have you been here? I think it's been a year. Let me make the arrangements. You can go out. [E] I'm gonna get you...! [MAN] [C] Black Cat, prepare to accept your mission. There's a pistol underneath your chair. Be careful not to reveal your identity. Now stand up. Walk towards the tail of the plane. [STEWARDESS] [E] Oh, I'm sorry. [C] Your target is the passenger in the 30th row by the aisle. [BABY GROANING] Open fire and kill her. Open fire and kill her! [E] Hijack! Nobody move! [SCREAMING] - [EXPLOSION] - [CATHERINE SCREAMS] Hey! What are you doing?! The experiment has failed. She must be terminated. I want to give her another chance. The Black Cat device has failed us. It isn't overriding her will. I can implant the other computer chip to control her. You can't do that! B2 hasn't been proven successful! If she won't go through with it, I'll find someone else who will. - [SCREAMING CONTINUES] - [SIGHS] [DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE] [ELECTRONIC NOISES] [MAN] [C] The old woman you met on the plane was actually a male terrorist in disguise. If that aeroplane-hijacking simulation was real, not only would you die but many others too because of you. Most of the time you can hardly distinguish what's real and what's not. We have a massive computer network, the most refined apparatus. And we have the best analysts. What we want from you is absolute obedience and to accomplish the orders. With current technology, it's actually very easy to control a person. We don't want to use such measures on you. What we need is an elite, not a robot. Sorry. You must be careful from now on. [E] Made up your mind? Come voluntarily or do we force you to help? - Make this thing the same goal. - You know what? I have told you. How many times have I told you that I'm not interested in putting something in my brain, OK?! I've explained how safe this B2 chip is and the importance to the CIA and country. - You have to help us. - I don't have to. Who the hell are you?! [MAN] It's not a matter of choice. Only we can control your temperament. [WOMAN] Use your brain! I'm not going to stake mine! Who are you to me? [MAN] We're the only people you've got to turn to now. Brian couldn't do it with the other girl. We need your help now. [SCREAMING] Somebody help in here! What's goin' on?! What... Shit! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Somebody go get an ambulance. [SOBBING] [C] The canteen staff tell me that a thief has been stealing the flowers lately. I haven't done it for a long time. That thief is me! [ENGINE ROARING] [SCREAMING] [LIVELY MUSIC] [CHEERING AND CLAPPING] [MUSIC IN DISTANCE] - Girls are really crazy about flowers. - 'Cause they're beautiful. Take these flowers to the bride for me. This is a Smith 5906. With two magazines. Each magazine contains 15 bullets. Go through the forest once you've completed the mission. A car will be waiting for you there. You have only three minutes. [WALTZ MUSIC] [SCREAMING] - [E] Get outta the way! - Hey! Are you OK? Hey! Why you takin' my bike? [TYRES SCREECHING] Go around! [BRAKES SCREECHING] [WHIMPERING] [SCREAMING] [C] You lied to me! The car wouldn't start! You wanted me dead! You've succeeded! Congratulations! You've overcome the final hurdle! [E] Come in. [MANDARIN] Please have a seat...! Welcome to Hong Kong. - Can you speak Mandarin? - A little bit. [SHARP INHALE AND EXHALE] It's almost 1997. You should polish up on your Mandarin. [E] Your job is to be a photojournalist. If you have no assignment, you can do as you like. Just don't draw attention to yourself. Here's some medicine. You'll be needing that. I know you often get headaches but you can't go to see a doctor because of the microchip in your brain. From now on, we're the only ones who can help you. [MAN] [C] Welcome, everyone, to our bird protection area. Today, the president of the World Wildlife Fund, Mr Erico Ebron, will have an unofficial visit here. He is not prepared to be interviewed. But everyone can take photos as they wish. In just a moment our colleague, Mr Chan, will take you around for a tour. But I'd like to remind everyone not to make too much noise. Otherwise, the birds will be scared away. [WOMAN] Of course he doesn't want any interviews. He's a sensitive man. [MAN] Exactly! The man trades weapons and we still welcome him. Hey, let's ask him his purpose for coming here! - [E] Welcome, Mr Ebron. - Thank you very much. We've prepared two boats for you, and Peter will take you there. [EBRON] Thank you very much. [REPORTER] [C] Hey, I want to ask about his involvement in the weapons trade. Please excuse me... - Can we interview him? - Excuse me...! [E] Mr Ebron, can I ask you some questions? As an ammunition supplier, why are you so interested in wildlife? - Hey, Mr Ebron! Wait! - Can you answer my question, please? [C] I think everyone's forgotten to remain quiet. Maybe Mr Chan can take you out on a tour. Follow me, everyone. This way, please! [MAN] Please come this way. [BIRDS TWEETING] [E] Help! Help! [SHUTTER] [SHUTTER] [C] Mr Yeung, an accident just happened. Hurry over and look! [RADIO] Erico Ebron, the president of the World Wildlife Fund suddenly dropped dead at the nature protection area this morning. No injury was reported after preliminary examination. Foul play isn't suspected... [RADIO STOPS] [DOOR OPENING] [PLAYS] [WATER RUNNING] Uncle Fat, black coffee and an egg sandwich. OK! Black coffee and an egg sandwich, darling! Mr Yeung, you came at the right time. I have something to ask you. That bird of mine never wants to sing! [YEUNG] Of course not. You always keep it in a cage. How can it sing whilst it's bored in a cage? I'll give you a good solution to this: just set it free and let it fly away. By then, it will surely sing sweetly. You must be kidding! Set it free? That bird cost me a lot of money to buy. [WOMAN] Of course you'd say that. You're an officer working at the Wildlife Protection Area. You love nature. Of course you'll encourage people to set all their birds free. I've said enough. I'll make your sandwich right away. - [WOMAN SHRIEKS] - My bird! - My bird...! - Hey...! My bird! How come...? - I said that you didn't hang it properly! - Will you just cut it out?! - This is an embarrassment! - Forget it! [YEUNG] Hey! Hey! Hey! You're pretty naughty, shooting down their birdcage! - You, too! Secretly taking photos of me... - Likewise! Guess we make a great match, then? So what's your name? - I'm Allen! What's yours? - I'm Erica! You must be from abroad. How did you know? Hong Kong girls don't easily give away their names. Hey, do you plan to keep talking like this? Oh, yeah... Hop in! [ENGINE STOPS] Help yourself! - Would you like some coffee? - OK, please. I heard that homes are quite small in Hong Kong. You've got a pretty big home. It's a government-provided dormitory. Oh yeah, where are you from? America? England? Canada? Australia? The Philippines? Ethiopia? I know! It must be Iraq! You've guessed the entire globe. I came back from America. It's not that bad being a journalist, you can travel around a lot. Your job isn't bad either, you can be with the birds every day. [WHISTLING, STOPS] Yeah, living in the New Territories. Not many people around, not many cars either. Even the air is fresher. But not everyone would appreciate my field of work. No way to get rich from it! Thanks. So how many pictures did you take of me? Come upstairs and have a look. Sorry, didn't mean to take photos of you. But I feel something special about you. Besides, I love taking pictures. [GASPING] What's wrong? My head hurts. - I'll call the doctor for you! - No! - Help me get the medicine from my bag! - OK! Is it this bottle? [CATHERINE] Hold me tight! Does it still hurt? Shall I take you to the doctor? [CATHERINE] No, I'll be fine later! Hold me tight! [GASPING DECREASES] Are you OK? Do you often get this kind of pain? I'll get you a glass of water! [E] Thank you. [C] I'll call you tonight. [M] Look who it is. [C] Brian! When did you get here? [CHUCKLES] - [M] Have a nice chat... - [E] Thank you. - [C] Do you like Hong Kong? - I like it! I know you have a very good boyfriend. So try to make the most of the good times from now on! You won't disappoint me, will you? [FILM SOUNDTRACK] [BLEEPING] The magazine house's looking for me. - Let's go. - No. I'll hurry back. Mr Chan, if you please... [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Just a moment. Mr Chan, phone. Hello? Hm. I'll be back right away. [SUSTAINED CAR HORN] Where'd you go midway through the film? Something urgent at the magazine house. - How was the movie? - Not bad! - Tell me how it ends. - Very happily. [E] Happy ending. [C] It's your loss for not seeing it. - So you like happy endings? - Everyone does. Don't you? They don't happen very often in real life. Why are you so pessimistic? But there is one thing I'm sure about. We'll definitely have a happy ending. [WOMAN] Catherine! Catherine! What's the matter? It's nothing. Let's go. [WOMAN] Catherine! Catherine! Catherine, don't you remember me? I'm Jenny! I think you've got the wrong person. I'm Erica. Let's go. [WOMAN] I'm certain that was Catherine! - How could she be Erica? - You got the wrong person. Are you kidding me? I grew up with her! How could I get it wrong? Catherine has been dead for two years. She's probably a lookalike. [NEWS THEME] Tonight, a serious gas explosion incident occurred in Shatin. The blast caused significant damages. - The couple in the apartment died. - Erica! - Police revealed the woman was pregnant. - What's the matter? Look, isn't that the pregnant lady who had mistaken you as Catherine this afternoon? A gas explosion occurred in her home. Her entire family died. A committee was formed by the gas company and fire services to investigate the real cause of the incident. - Our reporter now brings you the story. - Are you all right? I'm fine. Did you know her? It shows that the explosion was extremely powerful. - The aluminium-framed windows all fell. - Erica! Parts of the external wall were blasted to pieces. Are you really OK? It's believed that the couple were cooking at the time, and the explosion took place when they used the gas. I'm OK. I just feel sorry for them. You can tell me if anything happens. I can help you. It's OK. I'm really OK. I don't need your help. - Is your name really Catherine? - I'm not called Catherine, I'm Erica! Erica! According to an eye witness... It's getting late. I'm off. As steel reinforcement was approaching the top, the wire rope on the crane suddenly broke. Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! Allen! [SHRIEKS] - [LAUGHS] - So naughty! You scared me! That's so naughty of you! Pretending to be dead to scare me! Are you so afraid that I'd die? I couldn't care less if you lived or died. You've just hit me with so much strength, any fit person could've been killed. Can you stop saying 'death' all the time? - Why are you so superstitious? - I'm not, I worry about you. - But everyone will... - What have I just said? Why wasn't your heart beating a moment ago? My heart was beating, it's just that my heart is on the right side. That's strange. It really is! How come? I'm Superman! Mocking me?! Molester! - [DOORBELL] - Molester! Shh-shh-shh! You're in trouble. The cops are looking for you. Couldn't get any nice yellow flowers in Hong Kong. Like lilies? Is it OK if I come in? Sure, come in. - Hi, I'm Jack, Erica's cousin. - I'm Allen. Seems I've come too early. - I'll come back later. - You can stay, I need to get up for work. Thanks. Cousin, I've got something to ask you. What is it? Last night's explosion at Jenny's home. Was it your work? - You've been back in Hong Kong too long. - You...! Smile. You're being watched. Don't you forget your identity. Jenny was innocent! I grew up with her since we were little kids. I knew her well. The more she knew you, the more she was put in danger. I'm telling you. Last night's events were an accident. Nothing to do with us. I don't believe it! It's up to you, then. I must remind you. Don't get too sentimental. You'll be going to Japan next week. So have a good time on the side! - Allen, I'll be leaving now. - Leaving? Treat my cousin well. Don't bully her. [ALLEN] Sure! I hurt myself from shaving. Be a little more careful next time! Sometimes accidents can kill. I came here to return your harmonica. Thanks. Cousin! Cousin. What's the matter? I'm worried about Allen. I'm more worried about you. Can you promise me not to hurt him? We've never thought of hurting anyone. I won't feel at ease if he stays in Hong Kong on his own. I want him to come to Japan with me. That's up to you. [LIFT DOOR OPENS] [LIFT DOOR CLOSES] - [TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MUSIC] - HARMONY SEIWAKAI KAMIMACHI LOCAL COUNCIL SANWAKAI TOUMONKAI [MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY] [E] Stop! UNDER INSPECTION [JAPANESE] You need a permit to go through here. Here you go. Where are you going? I'm taking this customer to a bathhouse. Thank you very much. Could I see your passport, please? - Are you newly-weds? - Yes, that's right. Thank you very much. Well then, please go ahead. [MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY] Welcome. I'm very sorry for your coming all the way out here. I'm very sorry. Please. [CATHERINE] Yes. Thank you. [MUSIC CONTINUES] This way. Thank you. Your key. Please relax and feel free to spend as much time as you want. - [CATHERINE] Ya! - [ALLEN CHUCKLES] [C] I'm so tired from doing this all day long. It's even more tiring than going to work. Fine, don't do it, then! Show-off! Don't get so spiteful! I was only kidding! I'm not doing it! You must be dissatisfied with me. You're so bad! Tired? This feels nice. I've never been so happy before. Tell me something about your past. Were you unhappy in the past? It's OK. I won't ask again. [PHONE RINGING] - It's the phone! - Ignore it. Let me answer it. [J] Hello? [MAN] [C] Black Cat, prepare for your mission. The target will appear at the waterfall hot spring behind the inn in five minutes. Water temperature will be extremely high. You've only three minutes to dive through. Who called? - Wrong number. - I told you to ignore the call. No, I don't feel so well. How do you feel? I have a headache. Headache again? Where's your medicine? I'll get it for you. I didn't bring it along. Can you buy some Panadols for me? Hurry up! [DOOR CLOSES] [J] Mr Yamaguchi...! Somebody! Over here! Hey, over here! [MUSIC] [C] How many more secrets have you been hiding from me? You said you wouldn't ask. I can turn a blind eye to what you've done in the past. But I must know what you're doing now. I'm not telling because it's for your own good. I don't want it like this! How can you keep me guessing when we're together? Fine, then. We should break up. Trust me. I'm being true to you. For two people to be together, it's down to the word 'trust'. Don't you trust me? [PHONE RINGS] [MAN] Black Cat, the plans have changed. You must leave immediately. A taxi car awaits you at the backdoor of the hotel. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Get out. Head straight ahead. Someone will come to your aid. [STIFLED GROANS] What's wrong? He wanted to kill you! Take this to defend your life. Won't you get in the car? Sorry for dragging you into this mess. [ALLEN] This is no time to say something like that. You shouldn't return to HK for now. Find yourself a hiding place. We'd better not see each other again. I'll try my best to explain to the CIA. Hopefully they'll let you go. - But how can they kill people like that? - The world's not all reasonable. - But why do you... - Stop asking me questions, OK? It's almost dawn. I must leave. - I'll go with you! - Going with me is asking for trouble. I'm worried about you. I want to help you. How can you help me? You can't even bear putting a bird in a cage. I don't care! I won't leave you! Aren't you afraid of dying? I'm not. OK, then. Get in the car. - [J] All right. Keep going. - INSPECTION. STOP There's an inspection in progress. Follow this direction. This way. Enter. Yes. Go ahead. Please stop. Police. Thanks for stopping. Would you please be able to provide your licence or permit? Yes. I'm a foreign exchange student. - My brother's sick, - Come through. - so I'm finding a doctor for him. - Go through. The car at the rear, come through. - Please. - Come through. - Come through. - Please. - Yes. - This way. Yes. Where do you think you're going? - Where are you going? - Erica! Understood. Please go ahead. - Erica! Erica! - What are you doing...?! - Erica! Erica! - What are you doing here?! - Where are you going? What's your name? - Answer me. - Come down. - Yes. Come this way. This way. I don't know anything. I was just giving him a ride. - Over here! - We'll show you! He's got a pistol! - Pistol! - Don't move! You must have been involved in that murder! Idiot! - Hurry! - This is the inspection unit. We're near Izuhakone. The suspect has escaped in a taxi. Please send reinforcements to intercept the suspect in the taxi. Are you OK? [C] Why aren't you getting out of the car? You'll be dead if they get you! - [SIREN] - [BOTH GASP] Get in the car quickly! [CATHERINE YELLS] [GROANS] Why aren't you leaving? Go! Go! Erica! [CATHERINE] Don't come back! Go! Don't bother about me! [POLICE YELLING] How are you feeling? [CAR APPROACHING] [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] What do we do now? You stay in the car. Let me talk to them. Can you not kill Allen? No, he must die. If he must be killed, let me do it. Allen, come out! It's OK! Why wasn't your heart beating a moment ago? My heart was beating, it's just that my heart is on the right side. That's strange. It really is! How come?
