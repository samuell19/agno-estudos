St. Paul's Cathedral, London. That's right. Happily still standing after so much has taken place in recent years. And for many of us it's a symbol of something that will surely survive any other trials that may yet be in store. This may be the reason why a number of people who banded themselves together to make this picture possible. In the order of their appearance, these are the players who took part. Many others offered their services but did not eventually appear through no fault of their own. The main point was the eagerness of everyone to take part in a job of real teamwork. Of course, it takes more than actors to make a picture. And we were fortunate in being able to make use of many offers of assistance. Amount them, these writers. Also, these director sand producers contributed their time and skill. We have called the picture-- "Forever and a Day" was finally made possible only through the cordial cooperation of all the Hollywood Studio sand the technical branches of the industry. May we hope that this truly cooperative effort may symbolize the common effort of ourselves and our lives and may secure the ideals for which this picture stands. Hold the... governor. We are going to this air raid shelter every night. - It's a nuisance. - Well, I don't know. The floor is all started. I haven't been out with my husband in years. Oh, dearie. Hello, there. Of fly sorry to delay. That's perfectly all right. I'll guess you'll be needing this again. Thanks, Mr. Pomfret. Sorry you are leaving us. Well, so am I in a way. - Well, so long. - Good luck. - Thanks for your staying. - Oh, Mr. Pomfret. I wanted to wish you a pleasant crossing. But you're leaving rather early, aren't you? I have to be at the airport when my plane comes in. You have to be on hand to catch them these days. The early bird and all that kind of thing. I suppose you are looking forward to getting back to New York? Why not? From now on, I can be found anywhere on 52nd Street between 5th and 6th any night after 11. You meet seven days a week, sugar in the coffee. All that and Broadway too. It sounds very nice, sir. Yeah, doesn't it? Well, frankly I never did go much for the shock and shell stuff. If I'm going to collect shrapnel, I'll do it on my own country's time. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Oh, Mr. Pomfret, a cable for you, sir. Oh, not bad news I hope, sir. Oh, not exactly. Where's Pomfret Street? - Pomfret Street? Oh, that's on the other side of the park. - About four miles. - Thanks. Well, so long again. Goodbye, sir. Give me a sugar will you? I mean a pen. - Oh, here. - Yes. We hate to see you go, sir. Thank you, Sven. - See you in the near future, I hope. - I hope so, sir. With these coming over every night, sir, it's a case of maybe you will and maybe you won't, sir. - You know what I mean. - Take it easy. It's a 100 to 1 you'll be cursing out cabbies long after this is over. Hey, cabbie? Oh, the theory that them that was born to be hanged very seldom gets taken off by a bomb, eh, sir. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, Sven. But if it's not asking you too much, sir, when you're writing your story for the newspaper over in America, could you sort of of mention me like, sir. I'll see what I can do about it, Sven. Thank you. And if it isn't asking you too much, sir, the first name is Archibald. And if it isn't asking too much, sir, where too? We have to go to Pomfret Street first. Number Six, and step on it. Did you hear what he said? Number Six, Pomfret Street. A blinking elocutionist, is that what you got your medals for? One of these days I'll clip you. Thanks, I hope so too. Oh. As I was saying, way back in '17, me and Porkie was on our way back from the game when Porkie says to me-- Hello, the Jerry’s a bit late tonight, ain't they? On the contrary, I think they are a little early. You know you can't trust those Germans. No. But as a mater of fact, what did he say? What did who say? Your friend Mr. Porkie. Who's Porkie? Oh, very well. Here they come. Over the East End, they won't be coming this way. How do you know? Did they Oh, do hurry, Mummy. They started the concert already. Here we are, sir, Number Six, Pomfret Street. Better take cover, huh? Yes, thank you. Take the bags and duck into the shelter. I have a call to make. Right oh, sir. Hey. Thank you, my friends. And particularly you Mr. Higgins, who sang that song with much more feeling than I ever heard you sing in church. Now, the next on the program will be-- The next on the program will be Charlie. And now I know you're all in the mood, and we'll all join together in singing that lovely little ballad entitled, "I'd Love to Live in Loveland with a Girl Like You." I'd love to live in loveland with a girl like you where everyday is a holiday and skies are baby blue-- Blue. The color of your eyes. And the heart are always true-- Ha, that's for me. I'd love to live in loveland with a girl like you. Nice voice, it goes with your eyes. How about an encore, something more soothing like a lullaby. - Some other time. - Just a minute. I wanted to say, of course serving tea during an air raid. An idea of yours or Mrs. Trimble's? Oh, mine and Mrs. Trimble's. Well, then that would make her about as nice as you, wouldn't it? Would it? What I mean to say is shall we find some quiet corner and talk about that for awhile? You'll sit in the corner, I have to go upstairs. Then I'll run along with you. No you won't. But I have business with Ms. Trimble. Ms. Trimble doesn't see agents at night. If you have something to sell, drop round in the morning. But, but I started to say. You wouldn't let a little crack on the noggin stop you, would you, governor? Eustace Trimble built this house and wishes well to all who shelter here. Mr. Trimble thinks up a nice sentiment, and then he cracks you over the head with it. - Want me to come with you, governor? - No, you wait here. Got you. And now, my friends, we all have a heavy day ahead of us tomorrow. Sleep is essential. Shall we? Light now dark if we beseech thee, oh Lord. And by thy great mercy for there is more perils and danger of this night. For the love of thy only son, our savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes. I'd like to see Ms. Leslie Trimble. I'm Ms. Trimble. - What is it? - Well, it's about the house. This house. You wrote you'd like to buy it. Oh, yes. - Won't you come in. - Thank you. Just a moment, I have a candle here. Oh, oh, you're not Mr. Augustus Pomfret? No, I'm-- wait a minute. You seem alarmed at the thought that I might be. You've got something against the old boy? Oh, no. It's that-- uh, the matches. I've got a cigarette lighter. Thank you. Sorry, you can't go for old bumper. But I understand, young Gates, his son, is quite a lad, a great personality, and something of a blade. I can imagine. Oh, it's you. Well, hello. So you're Ms. Trimble. You know in the shelter with the apron-- Well, naturally I thought-- Not that it makes any difference. With or without it you're-- Ms. Trimble. You're an American, aren't you? What's your name? Warren Gates Trimble Pomfret. But we don't go much for the double barreled names back home. So it's Gates T. Pomfret. I see. We must be related some way down the line. It sort of brings us closer together, doesn't it? Does it? Do you intend to light the candle? Oh, the candle. Of course, I know you've reason not to like us. In fact you wanted to buy the house for so long, we wouldn't sell. What made you change your mind? This is a good time to sell a house, don't you think? When any minute it is likely to be bombed out of existence. Humm. And if I bought it, I'd be, something of what you Americans call a sap, wouldn't I? Because you don't look the part, I'm wondering why you want to buy? I hardly think you'd understand. - Shall we go into the drawing room? - Sure. Old, something in common with a pile of bones, doesn't it? Is it haunted? Every old house with character has its ghosts. Is that so? - Where do you keep them? - The ghosts? Oh, ghosts. I thought you said goats. Oh, well, just a gag. Americans haven't much feeling for old houses, have they? Oh, we like them, up to 10 years. Well, thank you. After that of course, being a generous people, we turn them over to the termites. Nice. Now that you've agreed to sell, what do you want for the property. Well, I wouldn't want to quote a figure that might embarrass you. Would 2.10 be too much? You may find it something to joke about, Mr. Pomfret. But amazing as it may seem to you, I do want to buy. Would you consider selling for 2,000 pounds? 2,000. Is there oil on the land? There is nothing on the property except an old house and a few memories. Oh, yes, the memories. I forgot about them. Well, let's see now, a good memory in first class shape is worth a little something. The worn out ones you can pick up a car. Well, speaking of memories. So that's the masterpiece. That happens to be a portrait of Admiral Trimble who built this house. What will you take for it? Would 2.10 be too much? Would you take this? Sure. Now, if you don't mind, I prefer to transact any further business through my solicitor. The door in the hallway leads down into the shelter. Goodbye, Mr. Pomfret. Yeah, but about the house? The portrait? Ms. Trimble. Trimble. Trimble, I want to take back all I said and apologize. Please don't. I want to. I barge in here like a half wit trying to be funny without any thought of what I might be doing to your feelings. And I'm sorry. You didn't know. There is no reason why you should feel as I do about things. Merely that I'm rather found of this house and everything in it. Born here, weren't you? My mother and I restored it to what it was originally, as nearly as we could. It was a boarding house when we leased it from your family. Point against us, huh? Well, it could have been kept in repair and lent to some decent family. But what good reason? It's just a house, and a very old one at that. Besides look at the neighborhood, the glue factory, gas works. I'm not referring to the surrounds. To the people who lived here. The people who lived here? You mean the Trimbles and Pomfrets? What did they ever do that was so wonderful? Nothing much. You contribute to the destiny of Britain, others would govern an industry, of course. But somehow, they were all people I'd like to have known. I... The Dutchman was a 74. I knew he was a Dutchmen by the.. Go on anyway. Go on. Whoa. Whoa there. Now there, there's a land, Admiral. The finest sight this side of London. Oh, take a good look at it, Admiral. You can almost feel the spring of the turf under your feet. I'm not buying spring. Five fertile acres, Admiral. Five miles for the city so you’ll never be built over. - How much you want for it? - Twenty pound an acre, sir. 100 pound the lot. It's a steal, a sacrifice. Half the price of any of the property around here. How's the price? - What's wrong with it? - Nothing, sir. Nothing at all. Wait what's this? Oh, that's it. The highwayman. By thunder, I haven't seen a swinging corps since my West Indian days, eh? You don't mind it, sir? Mind it-- Why the Admiral used to have one hanging from the arm every day and a brace on Monday. Oh, Fitz, Fitz, Fitz. Well, every other Monday. Mr. Stubbs, I'll buy your land and the highwayman too. What's that? That sir, now that's a bit of history, a bit of real history. That mound used to be a fortification. A fortification, eh? Hundred of years ago in the year 40 to be exact, a man named Coractocus built a fort there to defend himself against the Roman invasion. Did he began? And picked a fine spot too. Aves strategic, two big fields to fire his catapults, huh? And that's the way the invaders came. Over the downs and up the ladders. That's the way they'll come this time if our Parliament doesn't. Do you think there is any danger of invasion, Admiral? Danger? That little upstart Corsican Bonaparte's been walking up and down there for three years eyeing the Cliffs of Dover. He even has plans for a balloon. Thinks he can fly over. Does the government know about that, sir? Government, bah. Spaniards. I'm not relying on them. I'll build my house in the middle of that fort. And I'll defend it myself. Oh, let them come with their balloons and their barges. And instead of a pinch back highwayman, I'll have a general flying from my masthead, eh? I built this house, not for myself, but for you and for the others that are coming afterward. Here, come here. See that cherry tree? That's a nice place for the young lovers to sit, eh? - Bit public, don't you think? - Oh, no. Much more comfortable here. Ah, but lovers must have a place to sit outside as well as in. Hello, when did you sit for that? Sit be blow. I stood for three weeks. Very dry work. Good idea, young fellow. We'll go down below decks. Well, there's more work with bricks and mortar. Something that no builder can put into it, something that he can't take out of it. It isn't here, it isn't there. You just can't put your fingers on it. Hello. What's this. That's a fine sentiment father. Aye, aye. Built by sweat and squared-- Father the foundations. Look here, Billy. I took this myself from a French privateer. Brandy? Hmm, good stuff too. Lasted the family for years. Used on occasions. And this is one, eh, Billy. Well, here's to our name, Admiral. Ah. Yes. I don't know what's got into our Navy. Where they put men like me and Nelson on half pay. Well, Nelson's been recalled. He's at sea now. God help the French if he ever catches up to them. Well, what about me? Did the Admiral try forget to run the order of my ship, The Zebra, rechristened The Undaunted in honor of her commander. Eustice. Oh, coming my dear. Just another quick one, Billy. Eustice. Quick. Quick. Coming, my dear. Oh. What hit me? Drat that low arch. I've been meaning to get it altered. There is a storm coming up. - Fine house, Admiral. - Fine house. It'll be safer if you’d protect the right flank. Now if you'd allow me to dig a trench through your graveyard-- Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that. And why not, friend? Well, for spiritual reasons. Bak, what will your spiritual reasons get you when the invaders are sitting on your tombstones eating frogs, eh? Don't forget, father, there is a British Navy protecting your right flank, so why not take it easy now the house is completed. Completed? The house hasn't begun yet. When they will be weddings and children playing on the stairs. Now just a moment, father. Who's wedding and children are you speaking about? Ack, you know very well what I mean. Yes, I know very well what you mean. You've probably had my wife already picked out. Someone substantial to go with the house. This house is meant to last. She'll ride out many a gale like this one. Before she comes into her own, she'll see lots of people, good and bad. Aye, and strange happenings too no doubt. When a house begins to live-- - What's that? - What's what? She's soaked from to keel. Aye. Hey, Luchie. Poor thing. Who would she be? Time enough to worry about that when we get her out of these wet things and into bed. Ben, take her upstairs. Yes. And Eustice, get the warming pad immediately. Aye, aye. - What do you make of it, Admiral? - I'd give the lot. Saving your presence, Vicor, a storm that is a a young girl left unconscious on my door step. You stay with her, Bill, why I get some dry clothes and a hot drink. - Who is there? - In the name of the law. Who are you? William Barstowe is called to attention. Are you the house holder? No, I'm William Trimble, his son. We're looking for a Ms. Trenchard. She was observed from the inn running in here. That's quite right. Now if we might trouble you to bring us the young lady, we'll take her back. Back to Mr. Ambrose Pomfret, her guardian. Doubtless she's given you some cock and bull story about being mistreated. But I think I'm the best judge of what's good for her. I happen to be the man that she is going to marry. It's worse than I thought. Now look here, sir, are you going to hand over Ms.Trenchard? No, Mr. Barstowe, I'm not. Look here, sir, we are within our rights. Habeas Corpus, we are never the bother, you know. Goodnight, gentlemen. Stop or I shoot. Oh, Eustice. Right here. You know it was in self defense. It was in the moment. I can hardly wait. Be careful leave Bonaparte to me. It's all right, father. It's all right. It's just a local skirmish. Oh, I didn't know it would go off. I must have been pointing rather low. I wish it had been Bonaparte's backside. And that, and then that. And the last I finished with-- I suppose all this time Master Bill was just looking on twiddling his thumbs, eh? Oh, I must-- Isn't it all romantic? Just like a fairy tale. Yes. She looks a nice little thing in a way. And I really pity her having to go back to that old Barstowe. Oh, guardian or not, he can't force you to marry a man like that. - These are modern times. - It's 1804. Oh, I know Mr. Trimble. Perhaps I am too modern. After all, a woman rebelling against man's authority is a dangerous experiment. Still, what am I to do now? Well, I would suggest that you remain here with us. Mr. Pomfret. Well, now don't you worry. I've been looking forward to this. Will you be careful? Hmm? Careful? Oh, yes. I can be most careful. Mr. Trimble, I believe I owe you an apology for my ward's somewhat dramatic behavior. I think you owe the apology to Ms. Trenchard. And I must congratulate your mother on her marksmanship. Mr. Barstow will not be able to sit his horse for quite some time. Yes, we are all very good shots here, Mr. Pomfret. Come, my dear. We are both grateful to Mr.Trimble for his hospitality. But we must go now. Ms. Trenchard is staying here. As a lawyer, let me call your attention to Mr. Pomfret's rights in this matter. He has complete control over Ms. Trenchard until he relinquishes that guardianship on the day of her marriage. I'm sure Ms. Trenchard is quite well aware of that too. That is why I'm staying here. Mr. Trimble and I are going to be married immediately. Is this true, Mr. Trimble that you are marrying Miriam? Are you in the habit of doubting Miriam's word? My apologies, Mr. Trimble. And may I offer my congratulations. You have an attractive house here. Come, Tripp. - Good day, sir. - Good day. And as you do not appear to know it, your fiance's Christian name is Susan not Miriam. - Irritating family. - Yes. Not the first time they've annoyed me. - No, sir. - Pity. They will have to learn that I can be irritating too. He'll be back. You don't know him. He didn't believe that story of our marriage. Then we shall have to invite him to the wedding. Wedding? Why yes. You proposed to me you know. I, I propos-- Yes. Not five minutes ago on those steps over there you-- Oh, that was just to get rid of Mr. Pomfret. Oh, was it? That don't get rid of me, ma'am. You've compromised me. I've compromised you? You most certainly have. You've announced our marriage before practically the entire county. I insist that you make an honest man of me. Sitting in this garden war seems, seems so far away. Our gardens are worth fighting for. I do wish Eustace would think of his throat. I know he'll have one of my tonight. Eustace. Eustace. All right, my dear. I'll keep it low. I'll keep it low. Do wish we women weren't such cowards. Cowards? We are as brave as men, braver. We don't need drums and uniforms to do our duty thank goodness. I'd rather have a baby than go into battle. You haven't had the baby yet. - Is she still at the house. - Yes, poor dear. But any minute now. Well, I'm glad Master Bill is out of the way chasing them. It does keep his mind off it. Yes, but I wouldn't say the Admiral was exactly laughing his head off. Vicar, why do women have to have babies? Why can't they lay eggs like penguins. I'm afraid it's an ancient, Admiral. You don't have babies, do you, eh? Hello. They are casting up an infernal din with your bells, Vicar. What the devil. What's going on? Bad news. - Oh, my god. - What's wrong, Mitch? Listen to the bells. Bonfires. People shouting. What's it mean? It's a victory, a great victory at Trafalgar. Hold on. What do they say? They say that Lord Nelson has destroyed Bonaparte's entire fleet. Oh, hooray. Wonderful. Wonderful. Mitch, do you know what this means? It means we are free from invasion forever. Ah, but they say Lord Nelson-- They'll put him on the list, eh. Pop off to the cellar and draw me some of that special brandy. - Get some for yourself. - But Admiral-- Don't hug me now. Go and get the brandy. - Aye, aye, sir. - Lucy. Where's Lucy? Lucy? Lucy. Have you no occasion to bellow like an elephant when Susan is lying there-- Eee gad, woman, do you know what's happened? Nelson's done it again. He destroyed the fleet. England is saved. Three cheers for Nelson. God save the king. Hooray. Doctor, did it-- Eustace, a grandson. Yes, Eustace. And he's saying in his own way, God save the king. My grandson. Where is he? Let me see him. In a few minutes, Eustace. Bill's boy, born on the day of one of England's great victories, eh. It would even have been a greater victory, my dear, if you had been there. Oh, bless you. What did I tell you, doctor. There is nothing wrong with our navy. It's a great day for my grandson to be born, doctor. It's a great day, Eustace. Bill's son. Another Trimble. At least he can live in a free country. Admiral Trimble. What is that young fellow says? That young poet they are all talking about, Wordsworth. We must be free or die who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spake. When we are free-- And Bill has helped to make us free. Ha, bless him. What is it, Eustace? Billy. Eustace, you can come up now. I put the box on the.. Thank you. Don't be sad, mother. I'm not sad, darling. It's just that this has been our home for so long. Ever since before I was born. And that's a terribly long time ago. Yes, darling, a terribly long time ago. But now there are only you and I left, it's much too big for us, isn't it? My dearest, Susan, I should have known you at once. Almost as beautiful as ever. Why have you come here? That is a very curious question, Susan. I've come to live here. It was I who bought this house. Oh, naturally, I didn't use my own name. You were never, shall we say, very fond of me. And I thought you might make difficult. Besides I thought it might be more amusing to buy out your creditors without you detecting my fine, Italian hand. It was you who sold us up, I should have known. You and the Trimbles once did me a disservice. Now I think the accounts are clear. Good bye, Susan. Good bye, Master Trimble. Do you think you will be happy in this house? I am certain of it. Do you think you will be happy in a house that loved the people who built it? In a house that will hate your presence every moment you are in it? A house doesn't love or hate. A house is bricks and mortar. No, a house is more than bricks and mortar. It's all the people who have lived in it. It's their lies, their joys, and their sorrows. Love, friendship, decency, all the things you have never known. That's why this house doesn't want you. Spoken like a Trimble, my dear. Not a very likeable old cad, was he? I mean, he wasn't one of those you would have liked to have known, was he? Hardly. Yet, I bet he lived to a ripe old age and died lamented by all. No, Susan Trimble was right. He never spent a happy moment in this house. He always the feeling that it was never his. But still the Admiral-- What's the Matter with you? - Something wrong? - No, sir. It's him again. I was only noticing that you had rearranged the furniture. Well, it's my furniture isn't it? Yes, sir. And it's my house, isn't it? Yes, sir. Very well. Is there a cherry tree in the garden? Yes, sir. Cut it down. I beg your pardon, sir. Cut it down. Take it away. I don't want to see it. Yes, sir. I don't' want to see it. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it or you. Or anything to do with you. Stop staring at me. Stop staring at me, do you hear? It's no good, Pomfret This is not your house. And nothing you can do will make it yours. It is the Trimble's house. And it will always be the Trimble's house. They found him the next morning, quite dead. Quite dead? Oh, no. Now wait a minute. You're not trying to tell me that the old Admiral-- Well, it's as good an explanation as any I guess. No one knows, of course. I prefer to imagine it happened like that. I see. But look, all the Pomfret's couldn't have been bad. There must have been a decent one somewhere along the line. Because well, a Trimble must have married a Pomfret for there to be a Trimble-Pomfret, right? Yes. I think we better go down to the shelter. One never knows. But what about that good Pomfret? Are you interested in butterflies? Butterflies? Who me? I was only wondering if it might have been hereditary. There was an ancestor of yours, a Dexter Pomfret who was rather partial to them. He... It wasn't so. But in the case of Pumperduke versus Gooche, it was so. But then again in the case of Slop versus Stillwater, it wasn't so. You mean no? No. Nevertheless, Mr. Simpson, I have traveled 5,000 miles to get that portrait of the old Admiral. And I didn't intend to return to India without it. I think the present owner will have something to say about that. His name is Dexter Pomfret. Well, what of it? What of if? My dear, Ms. Trimble, he's the son of a Pomfret with whom your gran and grandfather had a blazing row back into 1804. Well, good heavens, surely he can’t have a grudge against me because of a stuffy family squabble nearly half a century ago. That shows you how little you know of the Pomfret family. - Sciatica. - Oh, I'm so sorry. That portrait has been in the possession of the Pomfrets for a great many years now. Gall bladder. Oh, I'm so sorry. And possession is 9 points of the law you know. That's exactly what I was thinking. Good day, Mr. Simpson. Good day. What type of a man is Dexter Pomfret? Oh, quite young. Owns an iron works. The Pomfret reciprocating engine is quite famous. Also collects butterflies and birds, I believe. Birds, butterflies, reciprocating engine, he's quite young. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Please thank Mr. Weatherbyand Mr. O'Donnell too. They're dead. Madame. Is Mr. Dexter Pomfret at home? Maybe he is and maybe he isn't. What name shall I say? Tell him it's a young lady. What is the nature of your visit? Butterflies. Indeed. Reciprocating butterflies. I will inform Mr. Pomfret of your arrival. Salome, I have lost my set of the one with the charming waistline. I left it in my. Pardon me, sir, I took the liberty of putting it among your which is entomologically more akin. Ah, charming little fellow. Exquisite dowling. Ah, look wonderful waistline. Well, what do you want? What are you waiting for? There is a young lady downstairs to see you, sir. A young lady? I don't know any young ladies. She said she wants to see you about reciprocating butterflies. Ah, you've been drinking again, hum? A likely tale indeed. A young lady coming to my house on a night like this. Now get out, Bellamy. You're preposterous. She got the portrait. But it never left the house. Dexter Pomfret had a certain charm. She married him. I cannot agree, Dexter. I really cannot agree. Mildred, I hear on the very best authority that in private matters our young and gracious queen bends to the authority of her husband, setting a wonderful example to the young matrons of today. But surely, Dexter carrying water upstairs for a bath is so old fashioned. No. Careful you idiot. Careful with that trunk. It's not made of iron. Maybe it should be, dear. Now that's an idea, iron trunks. Don't be silly. Isn't that what you are going away for, to look for new business? You know you can't get new business without new ideas. My dear, allow me to know my own business affairs best. Then allow me to know my own household affairs best. And I like the idea of having a bath with taps for the water to come out, hot or cold, whichever you want. You know they say you can actually lie down in them. Disgusting. Besides, you can have a bath as often as you like. My dear, are you suggesting that I don't know when I need a bath? Of course not, dear. You always know. Then let's hear no more about it. And let me tell you a further more that ancient Rome lost its greatness when its citizen were innovated by excessive warm bathing. Oh, darling, do keep still. Sorry, dear. My dear, since this is our first separation, let me assure you that I esteem you very highly in spite of the obstinacy which is characteristic of your-- - Sex, dear? - No, no, gender. - Good bye, dear. - Good bye, darling. Madame. Yes, Bellamy. A Mr. Dabb is in the back of the house. Very well. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Good morning. Now this is our very latest model. We call it The Windsor on account of Her Majesty having installed one in the castle of the same name. And I understand Her Majesty has taken a very great fancy to it. Indeed. Now this model is equipped with every device known to modern science. Works for the recline position all for the vertical position. Well, for myself. I prefer the declining position. But it's a matter of taste, no doubt. Auger. Auger. Oh, medium size. Go out and see the presses. See if the water is coming through. Oh, Bellamy, the master is coming home sooner than I expected. Oh, why I hope the master won’t be very, very angry. I pray he won't. Do you think my prayers will be heard? Not with this noise going on, madam. Ah, there you are ma'am. - Finished. - But it's so big. I never dreamed of a bath this size. Ah, I knew you'd be impressed, ma'am. And that can thing up there, what's that? Oh, that's the very latest thing, ma'am. So late, it's hardly out yet. It's known as a shower. An invention of the firm of Dabb's. Very refreshing, ma'am. Very refreshing. Refreshing? I don't understand. Well, all you have to do is to climb these here steps-- Here, show the lady, Wilks. Climb these here steps, and into the bath, and you fill the reticule with hot water, you step on the lift, and soaps up there brush, which is one of our most interesting and up to date appliances. You stand beneath, and put this here funnel on your head to protect your hair, and pour. But surely, it will wreck my clothes. Oh, lord, bless you, ma'am. You don't wear no clothes. Oh, the whole thing is impossible. And I never ordered it anyway. - You've no right to-- - Oh, don't worry, ma'am. Don't worry. A gift from the house of Dabb. A shower free with every bath. It's our little plan to increase business. Which is pretty hard to find these days. Don't your husband find business, ma'am? My husband-- Oh, you can't please nobody nowadays. Oh, Bellamy, how am I to break it to the master? You have to make up your mind quick, madame. He's just arrived. Mildred. - My dear, Mildred. - Oh, actually. My darling, don't come up. Oh, why not? - I have to change. - Sir. John Bunn is coming to luncheon. And-- How nice, dear. Well, if I play my cards well, it may mean a partnership with him. - Yes, dear. - Tea's waiting. - Tea? Tea at this time of the day? Well, would you like a little light refreshment? No, no, dear. Excuse me, I-- Oh, darling, do please me. Well, you're manner is very odd. What's the matter? - Is that paint I smell? - Paint, no. What's that noise? Oh, that drunken Bellamy. Excuse me. I'll not have that man, my dear. I'm going to settle accounts with him once and for all. Bellamy, you scoundrel. - What's this? - A bath? Take it out. I gave strict orders against this. Thought it would be a pleasant surprise for you. Take it out, I say. And this, and this, and this, and this, and-- One of my wife's little happy experiments in house planning. Oh. If you excuse me, I'll have it stopped. You see, he's upset now. But you wanted the bath taken out. A little more brandy, Sir John? Just to take your mind off your troubles. With three iron found I'm afraid it will take more than a little brandy to do that. Of course, I'm only a woman, you wouldn't be interested. But there must be some new uses for iron. What makes you think so? Oh, no, I can't tell you my idea. It's probably too silly. Oh, come, momma. How figure. Well, if you want more things made of iron what about baths. Baths. Hmm. What for? You may laugh, Sir John. But I am a woman, and I know that in a few years time, every house in this country will own a bath, a million home each with an iron bath. A Sir John Bunn bath. Baths? And you really think there is a future in baths? Indeed I do. You know The Queen has already installed one at Windsor. The Queen? A bath? Since when? Oh, quite a while, Sir John. Hmm, baths, iron baths. Hmm, oh, good ma'am. I think you've hit upon a very good idea. Oh, it's not my idea, Sir John. It's my husband's. He thought of it? Certainly. You know we have one here. All the latest fittings. My husband insists. Even one of those latest devices called showers. You'll laugh, of course, but you know I always thought your husband as a business man was a complete nincompoop. Oh, Sir John. So you've put in a bath and a shower too, eh. Oh, no, no. That was my wife. Oh, darling, don't be so modest. I've told Sir John everything. I don't care whose idea it was. it's grand. - It's what? - Let me see it. Certainly, Sir John. But wouldn't you like to finish your brandy first? Not while I can see a iron bath with a shower too. Come along. Eh, eh, eh. What's going on. - We're taking it out, sir. - Taking it out? What for? Why Mr. Pomfret doesn't like it. Oh, you see it isn't big enough. Not big enough? Why it's big enough for a horse. Oh, well, Sir John, I know I shouldn't talk about such things. But since it's all for the good of the iron trade, well, the bigger the family, the bigger the bath. My boy. For 15 years, the Trimble-Pomfrets were like most any other family with their gallant women. I solemnly pledge myself before god to pass my life in purity, to practice my profession faithfully, and to devote myself wholly to the welfare of those committed to my care. Seeing you at this moment, Elizabeth, brings me the deep conviction that the proudest words an Englishman can say will be my sister is serving with Florence Nightengale. Cornella Trimble Pomfret was not the only bride to grace the hallway stairs. They had their quarrels, bitter ones. You will do as I say. What was good enough for me shall be good enough for my son. I'm sorry, sir. I disagree with you. Times have changed. Silence, sir. You will either do as I say, or get out of this house and stay out. One was even knighted. To our charming host and hostess, Sir Anthony and Lady Trimble-Pomfret, long life and happiness. Here, here. Speech. Speech. I am, of course, grattered and flatified. Oh, dear, dear. Flattered and gratified. Ah, much better. By the very single honor Her Majesty has done us. I mean the title. I can't think why, really. Well, I mean we don't deserve it. Oh, yes, you do. A hundred times over. We shall at least try to keep it clean. That's right, Sir Anthony, give it a bath every Saturday night in the Pomfret tub. Hey, move them big legs of yours. Hmm? Oh, so it's you, eh? No, it's my twin sister. Now go on, move them. Go on. What's happening? Oh, a lot of Germans on horses. They are trying to suck up, they do. - Hey, why don't you come outside? - I can't. The front door is jammed. What's going on now? Oh, a lot of Indian princes and such like. Cool. What do they look like? Well, they look like they’ve been in the sun, they do. Oh, dear, I think I’ll lose my mind in a minute. What came through? So it's over. Right you are, Jenny. Look my children, there's our Jenny. Well, I don't seem to remember giving her permission to come out this morning. She's really quite pretty, you know. She appears to have washed her face for the occasion. Too bad we can't have a jubilee every day of the week. Julia, stop that. She's a particularly pretty girl. Personality, I detest that socialistic kind of beauty. Augustus, really, at times you make me feel a little ill. - Oh, Papa. - Yes. Well, look there's that awful Jim Trimble. Mama, I don't think you should speak like that of Cousin Jim. Edith, he's not our cousin. At least only three times removed, and that hardly counts. Here. How much longer are you going to be staying in the Trimble-Pomfret palace. Now look here, I'll thank you to speak respectful about our employer's residence. Well, seeing as how my great grand uncle both built and lived in the place, I think I've got a right to refer to the old manor as I please. Oh, no you haven't. Not by any means. When your great grand uncle lived here, there was no West Wing was there? Nor no electric lights, nor no gas oven, nor no telephone. Nor no horses carriage. Well, what's the idea of having a motor if you don't know how to run it. And who do the Trimble-Pomfretscall when the old bus falls to pieces every second Tuesday. Why Jim Trimble, of course. Oh, Mr. Trimble, we're having a little trouble with our motor. I wonder if you would mind-- Oh, you're just jealous because you haven't got a horseless carriage yourself. I should think your great grand uncle is spinning like a top in his grave if he could see you driving around in that smart coal cart of yours. Oh, no he wouldn't. Why it would make him only too happy to think there was one member of the family what could use his hands. And I don't mind telling you-- What? Well, never you mind. I've got plans, Miss Jenny Jones. - Big plans. - Oh. Aren't we mysterious. You are going to get quite a surprise one of these days. Might take your breath away, I shouldn't wonder. Well, break it to me gently, won't you. You know my heart's weak. If-- well-- will I see you Sunday? Oh, I don't know? I suppose so. Well, if you've got anything better to do, of course, it's quite all right with me. Now don't get me wrong, Mr. Trimble, I'm quite excited about the idea already. Well, don't get too excited, will you? That weak heart of yours won't stand it. - Jim-- - Eh? Nice seeing you. Nice seeing you, Jenny. I don't like this motor car. Why not, dear? It makes me feel rather foolish. Well, Papa, you wouldn't feel foolish if you bought the model I suggested. Augustus, you must never fear of the motor car dear. Oh, is up and coming. ...no doubt. It's disgraceful to drive a horse at that speed. And I don't like to see Jenny making an exhibition of herself in that way. Was that Jenny? Well, I hope his horse looses all-- If you had bought the more expensive model I'd-- Oh, do be quite please. Now don't get excited. Be calm. Why did you run away? Now careful everybody, careful. Not too near. Not too near. Oh, Papa. Can you mend it? Don't ask me questions. I know all about it. Whoa. Well. Why, it's Tim Trimble. Looks like you've had a bit of trouble, sir. Cool, might have all been blown sky high. Jenny, what on earth are you doing here? Well, your ladyship it was my afternoon off and Jim, I mean Mr. Trimble, suggested we might take a nice little jaunt into the country. I'm afraid she's smashed up pretty bad, sir. Well, I've learned my lesson. You may take this thing away at your earliest convenience, Trimble. Yes, sir. Where should I take it, sir? I don't care where you take it. I just hope never to see the confounded thing again ever. But, Papa. Surely you're not going to throw it away. I'm sure it can be repaired. Augustus, this is the last time that you or any member of my family ever steps into one of these motors again. Even if they could get the confounded things to work, I see no reason why anybody should want to race through the country at 14, 15, 16 miles an hour. Well, I never. - Why, Jim, it's as good as new. - Better. It ran 12 mile an hour between here and the yard. No. Yes, well, the bobby at the corner of Nugly Street spoke quite sharp about it. Well, more haste less waste say. Oh, drat that bell. I'll be back in a minute. Here, wait. I'm going away, Jenny. Going away. Where, where? Soon as I've unloaded them ten stacks of coal, then it's down to the sea and ships for me. What do you mean, Jim? You taking one of them day trips to Market? Oh, a bit further than that, Jenny. I'm off to America. No. Yes. I've been saving for this for years. And now I've got enough. More than enough in fact. Well, what are you going to do when you get there? Make a fortune. That's what I'm going to do. Oh, fancy that. Well, send me back a gold nugget or two for old times' sake, won't you? Oh, don't you fool yourself, Jenny. No man what can work with his hands is going to starve there. I can mend motorcars, maybe even build them. I tell you, Jenny, in three more years, we'll be in the 20th century. Big things will be happening. And America is the place where most of them is going to happen. Oh, but Jim, it's so far away. And all those red Indians live with you. Oh, there's that bell again. Oh, you wouldn't have to answer no more bells if--- What? If you was to come with me. What me, Jim? I've never been further than the Isle of Wright. Oh, what's the Isle of Wright got to do with it? Now come on, Jenny, what's your answer? I have to think rationally, Jim. After all, I don't get asked to America every day of the week, I'm not used to it. It's your big chance, Jenny. Why, most of the girls I know would jump at it. Oh, would they? I suppose you've been trying it out on some of them. Now there's no need to turn nasty. Oh, I'm not turning nasty. I mean I don't want no pistol put at my head. Besides well, don't seem right sometimes. Oh, don't it? All right Ms. hotty totty, you've had your chance and you have missed it. I'll empty those ten sacks, and I'm off. Oh, you can empty 100 sacks for all I care. Yes. And you can answer 100 bells for all I care. You ain't got no ambition. That's what's wrong with you. Well, you can take this and think yourself lucky. Oh, haven't you got a nerve. Jenny. Jenny. How I hate you. Oh, pray don't hurry. There's all the time in the world. Your face-- It wouldn't be my Aunt Mable's would it? Go on, get out of the way. Someone would think they let an elephant out. Oh, you-- Your face. Take a look at yourself, dear. It wouldn't do you any harm. Come into the garden, Maude. For the black light is slow. You did ring, Misses. Oh, no, we were toiling the bell because we thought you were dead. Edith. Witty as well as pretty, that's Ms. Edith. You really should try to be a little more prompt, Jen. Remember, punctuality is the politeness of kin. Yes, Miss. What have you been doing to your face? You look like a hotten tot. Oh. Oh, my goodness. Oh, dear. One. Oh, I beg your pardon, Ms. Edith. I'll go downstairs and clean up. No, Jenny. You can do that later. Will you pour the tea, please? Yes, Ms. Trimble. And try to remember, Jenny, that cleanliness is akin to godliness. Yes, miss. Come into the garden more for the black bass night is slow. Come into the garden more-- Two. No, only one lump please, Jenny. Um. I'm here, the gates alone. And the woodbine spiceses are wafted abroud and the musk of the road is low. Oh, sentimental dribble. You have no soul, Augustus. Jenny, did you take leave of your senses? I asked for a cup of tea not a bowl of syrup. And how many times have you told me not to talk like that to the servants? - Oh, hush. - I'm sorry, Mrs.. - I'll make you another one. - Thank you. I thought you were going for a bicycle ride? And so I am. But I'm most in the mood here. Jenny, will you get me my yellow dress please? Yes, miss. That wretched Jim Trimble doesn't have to make all that noise. And he only does it to annoy us too. Jenny. Oh, gracious. He's got my motor down there. He's put it together again. Oh, what a man. Jenny. Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Julie. I don't feel very well. - Do you mind if I go? - Oh, you poor child. You better lie down for a little while. Jim, wait. Wait, Jim. Oh. Oh no. Will you kindly tell me what’s going on in this house? - Where are you going? - America. For Charles Bravens, in appreciation of his devoted services as butler of this household, 100 pounds. The sum of 20 pounds to each of the other servants. Excuse me, Lady Trimble-Pomfret, but this dust. Shanks, this room has not been touched since my husband's death. I intended to do nothing until I was fully acquainted of his wishes. Please proceed. To conclude, the rest of my property both real and personal I leave to my poor wife. Poor. Poorer by reason of his death, I have no doubt Lady Trimble-Pomfret. Oh, oh. Please proceed Mr.Shanks. Especially this house, which has been our home and refuge for so many happy years, this little nest in which our dear children first saw the light of day-- Dear indeed. While Augustus in America and the two girls in the South of France, they didn't even come home for the funeral. In the unhappy event of my wife's death, I will and bequeath the said property to my dear son Augustus and the long line of Trimble-Pomfret's he will, I trust, beget. Do you understand that it was Sir Anthony's wish that I should continue to live in this house. I don't see that any other interpretation is possible. Hey, governor, what do we do with this nibs? Oh, put it in the attic with the rest of the junk. Aunt Caroline, couldn't we telegraph these menus instead of me packing each one by hand. It would be so much quicker. It might be quicker, but it wouldn't have the class. That's what makes the difference between a hotel and a boarding house, little things like that. And having the menus in French. I don't see that it matters so long as we feed them. Calling them croquettes doesn't make them any better. Oh, my dear-- - Mr. Fletcher? - Oh, Mrs. Ismay. Is there something that you want, Mr. Fletcher? Well, no. - Not exactly, that is-- my wife-- - Yes, your wife, Mr. Fletcher? Yes, my wife asked me to speak to you about one or two little items which seem to her to be amiss. There's the bathwater. It is not quite as hot as she would wish. Oh, and then there is a little question of the soup, it seems, well, my wife thinks it might be a little more plentiful-- - You mean she wants more soup? - Right. Oh, I beg your pardon, it's s, o, a, p, soap. Mr. Fletcher, perhaps Ms.Fletcher doesn't realize there happens to be a war on. I wouldn't mind-- - Major Garrow's bill. - Oh, thank you. Now see that you get it. Eh, bon jour. Good evening, I'm sure. - Good evening, Major. - Good evening, my dear. Major, please. Major, I was going through the accounts today. And I find that yours is a little overdue. Oh, don't you worry your pretty little head about that. This news is far more interesting than the accounts. These Americans are coming over in droves. By the way have you killed the fatted calf? Fatted calf? For the conquering hero. Isn't he coming home tonight? - Oh, Captain Barringer. - Yes, yes. Got his picture in the evening paper. Here he is. Fine one. Now listen to this. In accordance with the new plan of the government through extended leave to our heroes of the air, the first of these will be Captain Archibald Jade Barringer, VC, DSOMC who arrives in London this evening. - Handsome young buck, eh? - Yes, very. He's like his mother, isn't he? Yes. - Like his brother. - VC DSOMC. Has only been up there eight months and has gotten every possible medal he can get. I spent twenty years of my life in India, and all I got was a medal for the Dober. This young fellow is the most talked over young fellow in the whole of England. We've got to give him a rousing welcome. How about a little airplane made of sugar at the dinning room table? Sugar? In wartime? Oh, well, then we could eat it later on. Oh, no, I don't think so. I don't think Mr. And Mrs. Barringer will want any fuss made, nor would he. No, no fuss at all. But after all, everybody is dying to meet him. Aren't you? Of course. All the girls will be after him, all the pretty girls. Not that there are many left, except you. And, of course, Madame Gabby. Gabine. Madame Gabine. Still Gabby to me. Oh, hello there. He's getting. Oh, Captain, here's a letter for you. - Letter? - Oh, good. I know that sent. It's Madame Gabine. - Bonsoir, Captain. - Bonsoir, Madame. - Who's it from? - It's from your mother. Mother? Good evening, my dear. Good evening, Mrs.. You no idea how excited everyone is. Well, we are a little bit excited ourselves, aren't we, Well, it wouldn't be too much to say that we were mildly excited. I'm going to put these on the table. - Oh, let me. - No, no, I'll do it. - Did you see tonight's paper. - You have arraigned well. I hope you haven't been working too hard. Are you head aching? Look, Mr. Barringer. What? Why I say, Edith. Of course, Archie loves it. I know he does. - But how did you know? - Aha, I told her too. Look, they've all got flags. Oh, look Henry, they've all got flags. Oh, look here, burgundy. Yes, it's from the cellar. Very precious. Almost the last. There he is. He's here, Madame. Captain. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. Oh, no, no, no. It's not Barringer. It's not your boy, it's someone else. - Oh, it isn't him, Henry. - Oh, well. he'll be here. Well, if it Barringer, who is it? I don't know. Looks like an American solider. - Is that you, Marjorie? - Yes, it's Marjorie. - I want to meet Barringer. - You shall. Won't he? Of course. Come along, we're in the way here. Oh, yes. So sorry. - Trimble Hall? - Yes, sir. - You are an American, aren't you? - Oh, yes, sir. How do you do? My name's Garrow. Major Garrow. Very, very glad to have you fellows over here. Thank you, sir. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? - How are you? - Fine. Have you got a room with a bath for tonight? Well, we have a room, and we have a bath. But, as a matter of fact we have two bathrooms, but did you want a private bath? Well, it doesn't matter. I just want to stay here for tonight. Oh, excuse me. Let me register you. Thank you. - Trimble? - Yes. I'll show you to your room. Mr. and Mrs. Barringer, Mr. Trimble. - How do you do? - I'm glad to know you. How do you do? Oh, and that is Mr. Fletcher. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Now, how will this do? - Oh, this is fine. Fine. It's just swell. It's great. - Good as that? - Oh, you don't understand. You see, I've heard all about this place, and it's, well, it's a real bit of old England. What? What? I didn't say anything. I just said what. You know like Englishmen always say when they finish saying something, what. Or don't' they? Only when they are asking a question. Oh. How did your name happen to be Trimble? Well it's a long story. You see my mother used to live in this house. Oh, and that's how your name happened to be Trimble? Uh huh. Well, sort of. She was a housemaid here. And dad was the Trimble, see. Oh, a romance, and they eloped? A romance, uh huh. You know, if you don't mind my saying so, I've always heard that English people are awful cold. But you're not. Well, I mean the way you welcome people. Gosh the welcome I got downstairs, I've never seen anything like it. Everybody was standing at the door and singing, and then they cut off suddenly. That wasn't for you, that was for Captain Barringer. Oh, and all the time I thought-- Captain Barringer, you don't mean... Captain Barringer the flyer? - Yes. You met his mother and father downstairs just now. Gosh, and he's coming here. Yes. Fancy you knowing about him. Knowing about him? Why every kid in American knows Archie Barringer. Golly, maybe I can buy him a drink. Maybe. Oh, say, maybe I can buy him a couple of drinks. Golly, I feel wonderful. It must be the English air. - I'm very glad. - Oh, wait a minute. Could you put a bottle of champagne on ice? I rather doubt the ice. You're not going to doubt the champagne are you? Oh, what's time dinner? Could I write a letter home before-- Oh, yes sir. On account of, because of, dinner is being put off half an hour, sir. Captain Barringer hasn't come yet. Captain Barringer hasn't arrived yet. Yes but-- I heard you. I'll see you later. - Can I get anything for you, sir? - What? Could I do anything for you, sir? Betty, please. Since the war, things have been very quiet this time of year. The American solider. Oh. Maely, Maely. Mr. Trimble. - Oh, how do you do? - How do you do. Please come with me. I'm so sorry. All the single tables are gone. Oh, that's all right. Where's the champagne? - Are you alone? - Sure. You're not going to drink all that, are you? We'll have to carry you out. - Say, where's Captain Barringer? - Oh, he hasn't arrived yet, sir. We're expecting him any minute. Oh, what is this croquette d' rosette? Oh, not. - Is that cutless? - Today is meatless. They ought to taste all right, but somehow they don't stay with you. Leave a sort of hollow feeling. And then the fish. Oh, here, here. Sol bon Sam, codfish. Oh. I've got a sister in America. - You have a what? - I've got a sister in America. - You have? - Yes. - Lives in Chicago. - In Chicago-- You haven't ran into her? - Her name's Smith, Lily Smith. - Smith? Red hair, natural. Or at least it used to be. I haven't seen her for a long time, I dare say she touches it up now. Oh, yes, Mr. Barringer. Excuse the intrusion please. Oh, yes. - My name is Barringer, we met upstairs. - Yes, I remember. My wife and I saw that you we're all alone here, we wondered if you wouldn't join us? Why that's very nice of you, sir. You're expecting your son, are you not? I'm sure he would be very happy to meet a brother in arms shall we say. Well, thanks. Can I bring the giggle water? No problem. - You've met my wife. - Oh, yes. How do you do? I'll lay another place, Mr. Barringer. Please. Archie should be here. But traveling in England is so unsettled these days. I guess so. Oh, don't hold up your dinner on account of me, please. Oh, no, no, no. - We're waiting for Archie anyway. - They are keeping his hot. Oh, good. I guess you people don't realize what it means to me to be in London. And the very first night to meet well, the parents of a great guy like Archie Barringer. Seems so funny to think of Archie as a great guy. He isn't really, no more than any of the others. He's only 21, you know. - 21, is that so? - That's all. You see, to us he's, he's just Archie. - Our Archie, isn't he Henry? - Yes. He was only yesterday, he was riding his bicycle and playing with his carpentry sets. He was always very mechanical, you know. He was the sort of boy that could make anything work. I never could make anything work, not even the simplest things. Always on his birthday we used to ask him what he wanted. It was always a mechanical set. He used to make model airplanes. Is it Archie, dear? No, Henry. Of course, then we never thought anything like this war would happen, or that he'd be killing people. It was so unlike Archie. He was always such a gentle boy. Is that Archie? No, dear. You must be very, very proud of him. What's going on out here? Is this for us? Yes. Is he coming? No. Never. Let me call Mr. Barringer. - Please, please let me tell him. - Don't do that. My wife had made a cake put into it a lot of little sharps, couple of bits and a thimble, and a lucky horseshoe. All very silly I expect, but my son got the lucky horseshoe. Bit onto it. Broke his tooth as a matter of fact. - Oh, too bad. - And he always kept it. The horseshoe I mean. I often wonder if he still has it. I felt not quite seriously, of course, but I felt that perhaps it was that that brought him luck and kept him safe all this time. Do you think so, my dear? What's the matter. Can I-- Excuse me. Anne? Oh. Thank you. What are you doing? My head. You're cold. Would you like to lie down for a while? No, Henry. No, I don't' want to lie down. Oh, I'm all right, dear. Would you like a drop of brandy? No, thank you, Henry. I don't want any brandy. How about a cup of tea. Yes, cup of tea would be very nice. And Henry, go back to the young man. You want to be alone, don't you? Where did happen? When did it happen? Of course, there are no particulars yet. It's bad luck. Poor old Barringer. Mrs. Barringer told me he was only 21. Just a baby. Just a baby, I'd say. He shot down 21 planes, didn't he? It was 21 planes he shot down, wasn't it? Hush now. It's Ms. Barringer. Trimble, come on let's finish our dinner. Marjorie, bring him in, will you. I want to speak to Barringer. - I want-- - I'm so sorry. - I want to speak to Barringer. - Yes, dear. Sir, bad luck, sir. Some of us got off too darn well. Shall I go up to Mrs. Barringer? No, she, she would like to be alone, I think. Would you join us at the table, dear? Very good of you to bring this wine. - Shall I open it, sir? - What? Oh, why, of course, yes. How long is your leave? - 24 hours. - Oh, is that all. You must, I mean, I'm afraid this isn't a very cheerful sort of thing. You must arrange a theater or something, Marjorie. 24 hours from when? This afternoon, Winchester. Well, let's see their is a zoo, and then the Tower of London, and what else is there, Marjorie? Westminster Abby. Yes, yes, it's a very beautiful city, I think. Thank you, Maemie. Let me do it for you. Here we go. To America and England. If you don't mind, sir. I'd like to drink to Archie Barringer. You are very kind. - You know. - Yeah, I know. I've already seen the kitchen and their bedroom. And I promised her I'd take a look at the whole house, so if you don't mind? I thought you said it was-- Oh, I've dropped my. Oh, I'll help you. Well, that did it. Oh, I'm awfully sorry to have broken that. - Don't think about it. - Terribly sorry. You have another pair of them, do you? As a matter of fact, I haven't. Well, I say you look much better without them. This is the cellar you wanted to see. Much better. Oh, yes. Oh, look out, you don't bang your head. Everyone does. Well, thanks. Well, I don't see any ghosts down here. It isn't the ghosts that frighten me, it's the black beetle. - The what? - Black beetles. There's one right there. So she's afraid of beetles. More than air raids. It's funny, you are the first English girl I ever ran into. Am I? Would you write to me? Won't you? Because it takes an awful longtime to get a letter from home. Haven't you got a gal at home that writes to you? I've got my mother is all. You got a fella that writes to you, haven't you? I've got my brothers. No one at all? They've all I've got? How long have they been in France now? From the beginning. They are well and safe? I say a prayer for them every night. Gee, that's swell. - Would you say one more? - One more? Well, sort of a prayer for a stranger? I will. Well, you, you've seen the cellar. What's this? Euciste Trimble built this house and wishes well to all who shelter here, AD 1804. Gee, that's swell. It really is swell, you know? So you leave in the morning. In the morning. Bright and early. Well, early anyway. It will be cold. You better put your coat on. I don't want the coat. Englishmen go without the coat. - Don't be silly. - I don't need the coat. - Take the coat. - Why? - You'll be late, you better hurry. - No, I won't. Oh, I'll get it. Don't you know that there is a war on. I heard about it. Come say good bye. - I am saying goodbye. - No, I mean at the train. I work here, remember. In one little hour, you’ll be back here honest. Yes, I'll be back. And I'll have no job. I can fix that. How? Come to the depot, and I'll tell you. I can't. Go on. All right. If that's the way you feel about it, the war can wait. Goodbye sir, and come back. Bye. You sure you don't want to hear what it is we can do if you lose your job? Don't you want to hear? Oye, if you don't stop hanging about, you won't make no Victoria Station. And there will be no.. - Do you hear that? - Yeah, I heard. Please, Marjorie-- get going bud. And has as yet made little progress towards his goals. Here are a list of the German fighting self-sacrifices our troops. Words fail me to express the admiration which I feel for a splendid resistance offered by all ranks of our army under the most trying circumstances. Many amongst us now are tired. To those I would say that victory will belong to the side which holds out the longest. Yes, dear. How long? The Major is right. Good morning, Major. Not such a very good morning, Mrs. Barringer. You've seen the news, of course? - Not good? - Very bad. - What? - What did the Major say? What's bad. What's the news? It's nothing. Good morning, Major. The sun's out. - Oh, really. - Yeah. Morning. Good morning. Morning ladies. Enjoying breakfast, I hope. Good. Here's Captain Markham. - Hello, my boy. - Hello, Skipper. - How are you? - Fine thanks. Just as pretty as ever. - Yes, isn't she? - Yes. Yes. - Hello, sweetheart. - Oh, stop it. Where's your? - He's golfing. - Really? Jolly good day for it. Oh, oh, Mrs. Ismay, look as though you found a marble and broke a window. Oh, it's the news, Captain. Haven't you seen the papers? Of course, I've seen the papers. There is a jolly good article in them too. One here signed by a chap calls himself Non-doubter. Sir, if as Sir Douglas Hague says our backs are to the wall, could it be possible that there is forming in our midst a new light brigade? A light brigade of doubters, defeatist, and armature strategist. A light brigade who at the brave words our backs are to the wall permit themselves the morbid ecstasy of resignation to blackness and defeat. And will that light brigade turn back the pages of their warped memory if they can? To the other light brigade of Balaclava, the brigade that inspired the poet Tennyson to cry out in pride--From America? Yes, it's a letter from his mother. He has written and told her about us. Letters written to me about you. And I'm sending you our greetings and a hug and a kiss for my daughter in law. That is charming. When the war is over, and we can all be together again, I'm coming to England to pay you a visit. I'm so happy. The beautiful Mrs. Ismay, may I have the pleasure? Oh, I quite understand. I'm going to get a drink. And the roses will fade in the summer time. Though a rose may be part of a. A rose is a... Who's that? Who's that? You look much better without them. Much better. A prayer for a stranger. I will. Shortly after that, the hotel failed. Mother never could bring herself to leave her. She took over the lease and restored the house with the money my father left her. You know what's funny? It all seems part of some prearranged play. I mean the way the Trimblesand Pomfrets manage to get together every now and again. Doesn't it? Each generation does seem to find it's way here somehow. They are coming closer. That was a close one. Are you scared. No, I don't think so. That's strange. I should be frightened out of my wits. - Can that help? - How do you mean? Oh, please. Oh, sorry. I just took hold, and it was hard to let go. I see. You will stay-- You wanted to buy the portrait of Admiral Trimble. You understand now why I'd rather not sell it. Oh, that's fine. It should remain where it is in the family. That is if they should be a family. That one didn't have our name on it, did it, sir? No. I'm afraid. Don't be afraid, children. Don't be afraid. Ah, Ms. Trimble, this lovely old house is a shame. Yeah, isn't it? Well, come on sir, we can use you. Sure. - You all right in here? - All hale and hearty, friend. Thank you. There goes the All Clear. It was only Jerry unloading on his way home. Now we can go home, eh? Tough old bird. Even the Jerrys couldn't budge him, could they? No. But I'll have to. Why? Can't very well leave him up there, out in the open. Instead of moving him, why don’t we build up around him? Build again? What for? This? I understand how you feel. You loved an old house. And now it's gone. But the memories you treasured, their not destroyed. So let's build again. He would, wouldn't he? Yes, he would. He built for shelter, happiness, decency, dignity, everything that a home should stand for. So much of earth, so much of heaven. Oh, but he would want to make sure first that this would never happen again. You bet he would. And that's our job, yours and mine. Don't you think he'd like that? Oh, I'm sure he would.
