It's like taking sweets from a kid. Not bad, huh? Hmm? Thanks. Yeah. What do you reckon, was that a good move? Was that a good move? Hey, no conferring. Thought she might know a trick or two. Always distracted by pussy, that's your problem. Yeah. Oh well. Nope, this is mine. Come on, not the last one again. Hmm? No, you know my policy on herpes, mate. Keep it to yourself. It feels so surreal, man. One minute I'm in Boston at a funeral, next I'm here. It's too bad about your old man, mate. You know what, what better way to forget about things and heal than this, huh? Your big brother's old stomping ground, and getting your ass handed to you at chess. What a good one, what do you reckon, that good? Okay, that was good, but this is a checkmate. How the hell did that happen? Yeah, that happened. All right. All right, one more. And this time your derriere will be well and truly kicked. Victory is mine, I can smell it when it's ripe. That's your shorts. Well, it's better than your breath. She's all right, she. Way out of your league. What? What, you don't think I could do it? I know you can't, I've seen your game.

They'll take you to their third cousin's shack, where you'll leave either minus your kidneys or your Ben Franklins. I can handle this. I'm, uh, Ben. Fellow Red Sox fan. Just hanging out? Do you wanna join us for a drink? I'm all right. Okay. Okay. Um, hey, you didn't tell me your name. I know. Great, great. If I don't, okay, well, if you change your mind, I'll be right here. Well, that went well. It's hard to take seriously when she doesn't show up for a week. Hey Charlie, hey I like what you done with the place. Yeah. Oh, oh. You go in shy, there you go. There it is, it's simple. So you got one more fill? - Absolutely. - Yeah why not? Bei. Your Khmer is getting better. The only reason he knows the word for three is he's hoping for a threesome, huh? Oh. Hey Charlie, you let me know where we can find those mysterious hidden temples. You know what I'm talking 'bout, hmm? You know the ones deep in the jungle. Oh yeah, I know what you mean.

Oh look, quirky move. Shit, is she coming this way? Yeah she's coming, follow my lead all right. Dude she's not interested. Watch and learn young miser, watch and learn. Hello you. Well you can stand then. I kind of owe you an apology. For not telling me your name or not leaving me your number. So is this real? Yeah, it was used in human sacrifices. I guess one too many. I'm so sorry 'bout that. Can I buy you a drink? Yeah sure. This is where I come all the time. I like to sit and people watch. Oh right here. This is nice. So what can this piece of ass get you? Oh shit, you heard that? Okay my normal state is geekdom, not sexist dorktham. A big geek, short hair of the earth. Ah it's a common misconception, often perpetrated by geeks. Two wide please. It's a thing, the elk call this a safe haven for the lone female backpacker. I spend my entire days ducking sex tourists. I'm Ben, by the way. Wayward traveler heading north. Amber, heading anywhere south of where I'm from. Thanks. Thank you. To boys who will be... Degenerates. Well it's the last night in town with my brother, we're off on a big fishing trip tomorrow but I would rather stay in town for the rave. Oh, you're here to full moon, shroom, and get laid? So far so typical. Okay, what do you say tomorrow night you can stay at the house and listen to the jungle or you can travel the jungle with me and listen to some House.

Wow, this is nice. Please. He can keep you company. I won't be long. When does your roommate get back? Trust me, she's not your type. Yeah, I don't know about that. They say once a guy has seen a girl naked, her mystery fades, hunter's instinct dampens, and all sexual desire turns to fait accompli. Well speaking for myself, interest is definitely on the rise over here. Let's not rush anything tonight, okay? I had an amazing time. It's just, can we save the vacation fuck for another day? Yeah, yeah sure. Sorry, did I say or do anything wrong? Goodnight. Okay boys, last one back pays for lunch. No screw that, last time I won I still had to pay. I don't remember that happening, do you?

Those guys beat the shit out of me and now he's fucking dead. Oh fuck. He did this to you didn't he? We should go to the cops. No, no. They'll take one look at you and say that you did it. He set you up, making me as an accomplice. We just need to lay low. You can crash here until it blows over. God, we need to get you to a doctor. You're the one who needs a doctor. Those guys, did they? No I told you, I'm fine. You don't look fine Amber. They got Western doctors here. Don't you see? No one did this to me, I have epilepsy. Epilepsy? I just want it to go away. I should have told you before. My family, are pressuring me to have this neurosurgery in Boston. They don't speak Khmer too much. I think you should go. This is your ticket out.

Yes sir, your ointment. - Ointment, great. - Yes. Thank you so much. I'm also gonna need a couple of those. This one? Yes, thank you. How much? 10,000 riel. 10,000, there it is, thank you. He say death follows you. Really? Okay, find another gullible tourist okay. He say the dead man, his spirit, he follows you. Sir, did you hear me? Put the powder in her drink, please. Are you nuts?

Yeah, tea would be great. What? Amber? Oh, tea from tap water? Well if it doesn't kill you right? You wanna go for a sunset walk? Sure. I feel a little... You want to lay down. Fuck, Amber, Amber. Look at me. Oh fuck, fuck, oh please, oh shit. Amber! Oh shit. Hey open up please! Please open up! Who is it? The medicine you gave me for my girlfriend, she's reacted badly. She's not waking up. Amber, Amber can you hear me? Amber, can you hear me? Evil spirit. Bullshit, she's reacted to whatever the fuck you've given her. Now get her back. What she's saying? It's the language of the dead. She's saying, her name is Diona. She's got epilepsy, she has to go to a hospital. Help me. No. No! Help, stop! No, not this way. Must give blood, your blood. Get the hell out! Now! The demon speak.

What is this? Get it away, get it away. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. It's okay. It's okay. Do you remember what happened back there? Not really. I just woke up to all this weird shit all over me. So you don't remember strangling me? I only remember your touch, your smell, your tenderness. What happened here? Operation. I was a conjoined twin. My sister, we were separated, she didn't make it. Sorry, what was her name, your sister? Diona, why? Join us Ben. Join us Ben. How long you been there? Just quietly watching you snore. Very attractive in a man. Ah, like the Chinese proverb. The one who snores the loudest falls asleep first. Well if I had it my way, you wouldn't be sleeping at all. Shine and rise. Where'd you get that? The concierge were very obliging. It'll fry your brain. I wish. What? No, it's nothing. No come on. Your roommate, I mean her clothes are just gone. Yeah, she must have picked them up when we were sleeping. Can't say I'm gonna miss the bitch. Sorry, sometimes I just get confused okay. Okay. How long were you two staying together? I got here a week ago. We had a falling out, that's all. Oh. Aww, you bitch. We had a falling out that's all. I'm sorry, I thought you said you had only been here a couple of days. It's Cambodian time. What, you don't believe me? It was way before you and I hooked up. She's not even worth the headspace okay. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it, hey! Hmm, I saw you throw away her clothes this morning. Fuck me, if it isn't Sigmund Freud. What can't you just be straight with me? She was a friend of the family okay? Things got weird when I found out that she was into me. She flew home. Without her clothes? She traveled with two other cases. It was just this crazy weird situation, I wanted out. No more lies. You think 'cause you fucked me you've got a right to know everything that goes on in my head? You know what? You should go home, get your treatment, do what you got to do. And I'll join my brothers at North. Okay Ben, I fucked her. Is that what you wanted to hear? I fist fucked her all the way downtown and it was way hotter than you and me. Happy? You know what, I'm outta here. Yeah you do that. I'll find me a real companion. One who's not such a limp cock! Fuck. Ben, Ben wait. Hello? Dan. Is this Ben? Hey man it's me. Ben? Yeah and I think the line's bad. Yeah. Hey, I'm coming to join you guys first thing tomorrow. Uh-huh, tomorrow? Tomorrow, I'm coming up, first thing. No dude, we're back. Yeah. Come to the Happy Kep tonight, it's on bro. Hey play easy, you know you're buying the drinks, she likes you, you go to the hotel, and you negotiate then. I don't know man, it feels kind of weird. Bro, you just got dumped by a tourist, who cares. Easy. At least these ladies here are gracious and obliging, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's just the way shit happens around here, you'll get used to it. Look, that guy back there, that's Mr. Bong, he runs the show. He make sure they're checked for disease, they're paid properly, so they can feed their families. Hey look, the point is, if you're rejected, it's kind of an insult, and you don't want to do that. You know what I mean, be nice. You ladies okay with beer? Dan you know how to treat a woman. Did you have fun? Hey Ben. Yeah? This is Lillie. Hi, you have a very beautiful voice. Wait, dude have you noticed every girl here? Hey Lillie, this is my little brother Ben. Do me a favor, take really good care of him okay? He's a little tense. Dan come on man. Hey, hey. Have fun Ben. You look a little tense. You like oil massage? Oh God, Dan! Have fun. Guys, come on. Just go with it, just go with it. You might learn something. Is this your first time with a Cambodian girl? Yeah, look Lillie, you look very, very beautiful okay, but I'm not... Okay look, you should take this, here. If I don't do massage, my boss, he get very angry. He beat me up. Oh shit, fuck, really? No it's a joke, it's fun you don't want to do it. There's plenty more customers. Okay, all right goodnight. Yes. I've got a time bomb in my head. And it fucks with me every day. There's no need to look, 'cause half of the time I'm not even the person you want to see. I don't know who the other person is. They make me do things, hurt you. Maybe I got to go all out. Amber! Amber! Look at me, wake up. No, no, no, no. Come here, what did you take baby? What did you take? Oh shit. Shit, you got to spit that up, you got to spit that up, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Spit it up baby. Oh shit, you've got to get it out, there you go. There you go, come on. Please. Get it out baby. That's good, that's good. I came back for you. Why won't you let me try it? What's he gonna do, blow incense over you? Cut you up like that Chhor Eal freak? We need to get you to a real hospital, not these crazy scammers. Look, De Rais has testimonials from all over the world. This one's from Vancouver, another one from Australia, dozens of them. He's helped people like me. What can he offer you that the rest of the medical profession can't? Hope. I get that, but this could be dangerous. Well I'm not afraid anymore. And I'm out of options. Thank you for saving my life. You shouldn't have. But now I want to get better. For you, for us. Okay. He said to continue north. I haven't seen a road sign in three hours. It's got to be here, somewhere. Well whatever it is, it's in the middle of freaking nowhere. We're getting low on gas. It says it's close to where the road ends, look. What are you doing? Maybe someone will hear us. Okay. Maybe he knows the way to your witch doctor. You got a better idea? Yeah actually, hotel, langoustines followed by food, steam bath, and maybe a little toe sucking. Great, another dead end. De Rais? De Rais. You're just gonna follow this guy? Yeah, you coming? Do I have a choice? Mr. De Rais? Please rest, you must be thirsty. They say you're a great healer. I see things, I understand the nature of what it is that is all. You do your own healing. But you got my email? Can you help? Weighs on your heart and mind. It's very powerful. As I explained to you, will be necessary for... Just so you know, I think you're full of shit. Then why are you here? Because the last couple of days I've seen some shit that I can't explain. And I'm doing this for her. Ben, it's okay. It is an entity, it passed on in mortal form, now lives inside. These lamps, killing fields, this embodied spirits all around. I need a name, I need a name. Her name is Diona, Diona. Diona. Sister spirit is most powerful, was born with you. Each one carries the other. Amber come on, let's get the fuck out of here. No. Can you get rid of it? I will try. Ask my spirit guides to assist me in shifting it's presence. You need to be cleansed. Please do no be afraid. My assistants know what to do. I know you only want to protect her. I don't goddamn trust you. You saw for yourself. This entity, in many ways it is part of her, it feeds off of her. So what is your great plan? Oh the best way to deal with such an entity, disembowel it. This way. Put this on. You will be the most important part of the ceremony. Baby if you want out you tell me, I'll get you out okay? Now you must give vigil over her until daybreak. So you can destroy the evil entity when it appears. Whatever she says and does, do not free her. It is the evil entity, not her, understand? What is this? They're asking her sister spirit to step forward during the ritual. She may come in many forms. When the entity reveals itself, cut here to bleed it well. Evil entity will be driven into the animal, it will die with the animal. Be a man, make the cut. Only when the entity reveals herself. You must get her to speak her name. When she does, kill the goat, understand? It's the only way. Hey De Rais, De Rais! De Rais! Fuck. Ben. Yeah, yeah I'm here. I made a mistake, let me go. It'll soon be over. No. What? Why me? No. Amber, amber. Baby can you hear me? De Rais? De Rais is that you? Oh, oh, keep it together. What do you want? Hmm? Help me, release me. Amber I swear there is some weird shit going on in here. Are you doing this? What have you done? What is this? Hmm? You have to stay, until it's over. No, no please. If you love me, I need my meds. I don't have 'em. I said get my meds! No, no, no, no! Say your name! My name is Amber! Please Ben don't kill him. Amber, is that you? It's me. I feel like myself I think. I think it's over. Oh Ben, you know me. Oh I'm the girl that wants to get the fuck out of here and dive into a nice hot soak with you. Come on baby, please. Oh my god I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Thank you. What are you waiting for? Untie me! Is it just me, are you horny as hell too? When was the last time you fucked a girl up the ass Ben? Come on, they've got me all tied up and ready for you, those little bitches. You stop this. Don't be a pussy, I know, I know you want it. I know everything about you. I know exactly how you like it. Diona, fuck you. No, no don't. Amber, Amber, Amber look at me. Baby, oh no baby, baby. You risked everything for me. You okay? Mm-hmm, it's over. Amber, Amber. Amber. Wait, who are you? No, no. No, no, no! Listen I don't know if this one's gonna work out. Look, I'm not gonna do this anymore, okay? Not this way. Thank you for saving my life. You shouldn't have. The best way to deal with an entity such as this, disembowel it. It was the only way. She won't return? Your sister's spirit now in him. She won't return. She's free. No one can ever know. Thank you.
