I would really feel better if you would at least say goodbye. - That's all, just goodbye. - MAN: Goodbye. LEO: That's all you're gonna say is goodbye? MAN: That's all you asked me to say. When you get this craziness out of your head and move back, I'll say hello. LEO: Dad, I'm not moving back. I'm staying there until I make it. I just feel it's the right thing to do. So, I have to do it. I told you that. MAN: Do you know how much $13,000 is? That's how much they're starting teachers out within Pennsylvania, $13,000. LEO: But I don't wanna be a teacher. I wanna be an actor. MAN: Leo, I've seen you act. And quite frankly, you're not a Victor Mature.

No. - You got a place to stay? - Not really. No. DENNIS: Well, it will take you about 10 minutes to get here. Now, you get back on the Hollywood Freeway.

Love Boat, Barney Miller, Mash, Mash. [LAUGHS] It isn't an acting job, Leo. I work for a public relations firm. Really? Well, things are a little slow now, huh? Yeah, a little. - So, what are you doing here? - What am I doing here? - What are you doing here? - Did you graduate? Yes, yes, I graduated. Thank God. Right away, my father expects me to go into teaching. He can't believe I could be serious about being an actor. To him, acting is playing and sinning. He just doesn't understand. Leo, I hope you thought this out before you left. What's to think out? I move to Hollywood. I'm gonna get my own TV series - and become a star. - Just like that, huh? That's right. Well, what are you gonna live on until you become a star? Did you bring any money? I have enough to get by for a while. What is it? You sound like my father. Well, we will talk more about this - when I get home, young man. - Right, dad. [LAUGHTER] - I'm glad you're here. - Me too.

Hitler isn't dead. - They didn't get him. - DENNIS: What? He's a guard at Universal Studios. That Nazi wouldn't believe I was an extra on The Incredible Hulk. Are you gonna be in there much longer? No. The hot water is gone. I'm finished. [WATER GUSHING] LEO: [HUMMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Well, Dennis, geez. This really takes crust. I move in and you start screwing around with a... you know what. Is there no trust between us, Dennis? Leo, I've got to talk to you. Look. He thinks he is the husband. - I'm the husband. - Leo. All right. You can be the husband. - Will you stop it? - I'm sorry. I didn't know you will bring in a girl in here. - Why didn't you tell me? - This is my apartment. I don't have to tell anybody. Do you mind? Mind? Of course, I don't mind. I'll just watch. All right, all right. I'm going. I'm sorry. I'm going. - Don't you just love his tush? - [LAUGHS] Gotcha. Tush gets him every time.

DENNIS: She left 20 minutes ago. All right. Elvis [INDISTINCT] strikes again. Yeah, right. I remember the time when we were [INDISTINCT] Now, listen. Leo, Leo, I got to get some sleep. I got to go to a party this afternoon. Party? What kind of party? Tony Sholl has this annual thing at his house. Tony Sholl, the guy who directed all the Van Dyke shows? Yeah. That's right. He's a client of the firm. He's having this big, extravagant, eccentric lawn party where everybody has to wear jogging outfits. He's crazy for costumes. I have to go. Dennis, I have to go. I have a jogging outfit. No, absolutely not. LEO: Why not? Because I am not that buddy- buddy with Tony Sholl. He's just a client. Yeah. But there's gonna be a lot of people there who are in the business. I can make a lot of connections. Oh, come on, Dennis. This isn't a lot to ask. No. Nyet. Verboten. All right, all right. I didn't wanna have to do this, Dennis. But you know we want a lot of money in college on my ability to belch anytime, anywhere. I just had three raspberry jelly doughnuts and if you don't let me go they're all coming up in technicolor. All right. I'm starting Dennis. [BELCHING] Come on Dennis you got to let me go.

Punk. # You made my world begin # How can I tell my heart is beating # # You are my everything The early work that he did in New York, it was just unbelievable... wait, just excuse me Arthur. Tony would you come here? - Yeah. - Excuse me. I was just explaining to Arthur here about the, uh, early work you did in New York, you know, live TV drama with George Shafer? Dennis stop will you, you're embarrassing me. Kid's always talking business, it's a party let's enjoy each other. Nice meeting you Mr. [INDISTINCT] - Nice to meet you. - Nice looking girl. You're doing fine, doing just fine, keep it up. Get a little more subtle, huh? You had to wear the same outfit? So, the kid throws himself on the grenade and it blows his guts out. And the sergeant who he hated gives the metal to his mother. It's a good idea. You know, when you get something on paper we'll form a production company, we'll make it a package deal, who do you have in mind to play the kid? Well, I sort of had me in mind. Oh, no, too tall.

WOMAN: Boy, she's a spitting image of her mother. Has the same qualities. WOMAN: Yeah. Including that stud on her arm. WOMAN: Like, mother, like, daughter. Basically all acting coaches are the same. That's not true, I've been studying with Victor Jarvis for a little over a year. I've been to Victor Jarvis, what's so special about him? Well, he teaches you to create a character from within your own natural sphere. None of that extemporaneous pretend you're [INDISTINCT] Thank you, hello. Oh, you were wonderful in that little part you played with me. Oh, Phil so nice to see you. Wonderful to see you. - Hello, hello... - Nice to meet you. Oh, you put on a little weight since I've seen you. - JOHNNY: Hey, Christina. - Ah, Tony how are you? Why aren't you in a jogging outfit?

Oh, come on Loree. I've always wanted to her. Well, I'm going to go over and introduce myself. - Me too. - Come on. Excuse me this Victor Jarvis is pretty good, huh? - Yes. - Think maybe I should call him, I just moved here from back east, you know, and... Oh, he has a long waiting list. Oh, that's okay. Uh, that's enough, that's enough guys, let her mingle, let her mingle with the older crowd, please. It's nice to see you again darling. You too. Loree. Don't you look adorable. Hi, darling. I can't believe it Christina Harper, an Academy Award winner. I've seen Maybe Tomorrow seven times. Thank you. Oh, honey give me a sip of your drink, I'm dying. Uh, I'll go get you one, okay? He's cute, is that your date? No, no, no, no, I'm her date Ms. Harper. Mom, I didn't think you were coming. Oh, I wasn't but Tony called me on the phone and started whining at me and you know I can't resist that nut. - Here you go. - Thank you. That little umbrella is in case a rain cloud forms over your drink. Yeah. Sweetheart let's take a walk, I haven't talked to you in weeks. Tell me what have you been doing? # Oh, la, oh, la, oh, la, la, la # Man she's really something isn't she? Yeah. And her mother's not bad either. Come on, Mr. Sholl, pantomime my favorite song.

Yeah, yeah. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, he's great, isn't he great? Big deal. He does it every year. Yeah. But he does a great Jolson, I love Jolson. It's boring, he's boring. Hey, you shouldn't talk about him like that, he's the host. I'm the hostess, I'm his wife. Believe me he's boring. # California here I come Yeah. # Right back where I started from # # Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring # # Each morning at dawning birdies sing and everything # # A sun kissed miss said don't be late, ah # # That's why I cannot hardly wait # Come on, come on. # Open up, open up, open up, that Golden Gate # # California here I come [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] # California here I come Yeah. # Right back where I started from # # Where bowers for flowers bloom in a spring # # Each morning that dawning birdies sing # # And everything that sun kissed miss said, ah # # Don't be late, ah # That's why I can hardly wait # Come on, come on, # Open up, open up, moving up # # That Golden Gate # California here I come Ba-bop, baba doo-doo ba-doo. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You're pissed aren't you? Dennis, uh, I never planned for that to happen. I know I promised you but sometimes when things happen the way they happen, they just happen. You gotta go with it. Leo just wait a minute. It was really good of you to bring me Dennis. I met a lot of important people there, you know. What about me? The person I bring to my client's party winds up in the shallow end of his pool. What's a pool for? To go swimming in. But not the singing, it is not the singing. - [LAUGHS] - And it's not funny. You embarrassed me and made a jackass out of yourself. And it was a party, everybody was having fun. I definitely do not think I made a jackass out of myself. Why is this bothering you so much? Why is this bother me so much? Lord, give me strength. You begged me to take you to that party, you promised me you wouldn't make a nut out of yourself. I told you I got carried away. Leo, sit down. - Sit down. - All right. I don't think is gonna work out. - What's not? - Will you just listen to me? I appreciate what you're trying to do but you're gonna have to go through a lot of crap. I know. I went through it, and I don't like going through it again with you. I can't handle it. You wanna be an actor, all right, but do it the right way. You're gonna have to work hard, audition, get into a class, audition, get an agent, audition, audition, audition. And maybe, just maybe if you're lucky and for no other reason some jerk who should be pumping gas will give you a break. But don't do it the way you're doing it and you don't storm the walls of Paramount, Leo, because believe or not, they're not just sitting there waiting for you. And you don't do it sleeping on my couch. I think it's a good idea for you to get out on your own. Listen, um, we got to stay in touch right? Yeah. And I appreciate all you've done. And I'm gonna make it. # Nobody stops to listen # Nobody even will take the time # # People go by # Like floating day dreams # In your mind # Wanting to find # An answer # Fools try to just make some sense of it # # After a while # You'll find the pieces # Start to fit # LA is only a movie # Made to someday disappear # One day they'll say # Let the lights dim # Strike all the sets # Bring the players in # Wondering # If it ever was here [BIRDS CHIRPING] Thank God, it didn't rain. [PANTING] LEO: Excuse me ma'am. Ma'am, can you just hold it a minute? Lady could you hold it a second. What are you doing? What's with you? You stay away from me. I've got mace concealed in this wetsuit. Mace? All I wanna know is the time. Degenerate. If you're still here in five minutes. I'm coming back with my Doberman Pincher and I know karate too. [GRUNTS] Karate. Jesus. She doesn't exactly look like a black belt. I can't believe it. People around here are crazy. [CAR ENGINE TURNING OVER] My God. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: No loud music after midnight. No parties weeknights, no more than five people in a room in any one time, - you got it? - Yeah. - Huh? - Yeah. Huh? A hundred twenty-five bucks a month champ. First month in advance. Yeah, well this is nice. Hmm, a lot of rustic charm. What are you kidding? It's a fleabag. But you can't afford anything better so you're taking it, am I right? Huh? [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] You're the first agent I've gotten to see. First of all, you are a member of the screen actors guild, right? No. But I'll join. You can't just join. You have other have a part before they let you in? LEO: How do I get a part? Well, that's what agents are for. Then you'll represent me? I'm sorry kid. I can't touch you unless you're a member of the screen actors guild. Honey, get me you know who for lunch will you please? [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] No, he's a client of yours. He said you'd see me. Well, I'm from back East, I've been doing Broad... awful, oh yeah, yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] I did it for you. I killed her. But it might as well have been you who pulled the trigger. Don't blame your filthy act on me. It was your decision. Don't use me as an excuse. Well, it doesn't matter now. [SIGHS] Nothing matters now. Okay George. Sit down, both of you. Linda, you know what kid, I think after all these months you're finally getting what we're going after here. Good. Oh, George. George, George, George, George, George. George, George, George, George. You're still relying on those cute little tricks we're trying to get rid of. Yeah. VICTOR: Stand up George. Linda, up. Will you look into her eyes for me George? Look into her eyes? You have to turn your head. [CHUCKLES] VICTOR: That's it. Now, what do you see George? - Brown eyes. - [LAUGHTER] Oh George. - Yeah. - VICTOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's take a break. Leo? - Leo? - Yes, sir? Mr. Jarvis, I wanna thank you again for taking me in your class. I think I'm gonna get a lot out of it. Good Leo, you wanna look this scene - over page 15 to page 17. - Sure. Loree. Yeah? Loree, you need a partner, why don't you team up with Leo, - page 15 to page 17. - LOREE: Okay. VICTOR: Do this at the end of the class. It'll give you a good exercise in sight reading. And Leo. We'll see what you got. LEO: Whenever you're ready Loree. Frank. You don't need me. You only need someone to pass the time with. Maybe you're right. [LAUGHTER] LEO: You know your problem. I gave you too much. [LAUGHTER] The best of everything. [LAUGHTER] Ah! Big house, diamonds, beautiful crystal. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHS] All right Leo. Very nice Loree. Thank you, Victor. Leo... - interesting. - Oh, good. VICTOR: I didn't say it was good. I said it was interesting. Interesting that you know absolutely nothing about acting. That'll be enough for now. Marvin, you read... you read the entire play, cover to cover and then do scenes page 34 to page 55, playing all the characters, understand? And do it realistically, allow the thing to happen, all right, and now go ahead. Victor, you don't expect me to work that moron in there? VICTOR: [SIGHS] Loree, you can't always work with the Jack Nicholsons and the Rod Steigers, you have to learn to work with bad actors too. You're gonna run into the Leo Greens your whole life. I doubt it very much. VICTOR: And not everyone has your intensity, Loree. Well, that's very nice of your say Victor, but Bozo the Clown in there doesn't even come close. VICTOR: Well, do you know what the word "Empathy" means? - Hmm. - LOREE: Yeah. VICTOR: You have to learn to empathize with your fellow actors. [LAUGHTER OVER TV] Tony[INDISTINCT]. [LAUGHTER OVER TV] MAN: Who'd you save this for, meanie? - [LAUGHTER OVER TV] - [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello Morris. Under no circumstances let this phone ring. I'll explain it to you later. Just don't let it ring. Oh. I'll just[INDISTINCT] you[INDISTINCT] [TV WHIRRING] WOMAN: [LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER OVER TV] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER OVER TV] LEO: Hello? LOREE: Is this Leo? LEO: Yes, this is Leo. LOREE: Well, this is Loree Harper from acting class. I think we ought to meet and go over the scene a few times, okay? LEO: Yeah. All right. Yeah. Sure. LOREE: Well, can you meet me tomorrow at Brentwood Market? Now, I'm gonna be over that way about 11:00. Do you know where it is? LEO: Yeah, I know where it is. I'll find it. I heard what you told Jarvis after class. Uh... that was a, um... a private conversation. Look, if you want another partner, that's fine with me. I hear that next month after he does Hamlet at old Dick, Laurence Olivier is available. I happen to be serious about my career. Do you think I'm not serious? Moving 3,000 miles away from home is serious. I mean, once you get past El Paso, you stop giggling. Where did you make your big move from? Beverly Hills? You probably go home for Sunday ranch with the gang. Although, it's a little hard to drop in on the folks for the weekend when the folks are in Philadelphia. So don't tell me I'm not serious, all right? - I'm sorry. - Look, maybe I went a little overboard the other night. And I was nervous and when I'm nervous, I laugh, and I have to make other people laugh. But contrary to what you may think, I'm not a moron. All right. I'm sorry. Let's just do the scene, okay? And... next class, I'll, um, ask for another partner. No. I think he wants us to work on this... together. Uh... yeah. Did you, um... learn these lines? Of course I learned my lines. [CHUCKLES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Yes. One, two, three. I got an agent. Will you dance with me, dance with me? [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? LOREE: Leo, hi. It's Loree. I had a message on my service saying you called? Loree, I got an agent. Oh, good. Who'd you get? LEO: Norman Glory. That's good. I've heard of him. Uh, how did you get an agent? You don't have a SAG card. I know, I lied. I told him I did a training film for the Air Force. I'm going crazy. I gotta go out and celebrate. Loree, uh, you know, I haven't been here that long and... I don't know too many people, so... [SIGHS] well what are you doing? Would you like to, uh... would you like to go and have lunch and celebrate with me? Oh, well, I'm... Come on Loree. I'll pick you up in half hour. And, nothing fancy. I'm a mess. LEO: All right. So you're mess. Don't worry about it. Goodbye. Thanks. All right. Here you go. Can you hold this for me for a minute? - Thanks. - [CAR HORN HONKS] - I don't believe you. - What? Burritos, you'll love them. LOREE: Burritos before noon. LEO: All right. Enjoy your burritos but don't ask for seconds. What's the matter? Uh, nothing. Are you sure? Well, you said we're gonna go out to eat. This is out. I got napkins too. Cute, huh? You can pretend you're eating lobster. I'll save it for later. I'll tell you what. When I start on my first TV series, we'll go to Howard Johnson's, sit down, order from a menu and eat like real people. Is that what you wanna be? - TV star? - Oh, yeah. I wanna be Phil Silvers, Bilko. Jackie Gleason, Dick Van Dyke, - my Uncle Herb. - Who's Uncle Herb? Uncle Herb was my dad's brother. He was a bum. The man never had a regular job in his life, but God, did he make people laugh. I never had an Uncle Herb. LEO: Yeah, but you have a mother who happens to be a superstar. So what? It doesn't mean that you're automatically go sailing into a brilliant career. Everybody thinks that superstar mothers are different from regular mothers. I bet my mom is no different from yours. I still had to clean up my room. She got mad at me if I got bad grades. She never got along any of my maids. LEO: Did she tell you to stop biting your lip? What? How'd you know? What? About my lip biting. What about it? My mom was always telling me... oh, never mind. It's just a bad habit that I have. That's a bad habit? Jesus. I thought you're gonna tell me something really good, like you always left the toilet seat up or something. That's what I got yelled at for. Well, I didn't get yelled at for that. - Of course, not. - [LAUGHS] Oh, look at me, I'm laughing at a bad joke. LEO: Wait a minute, it wasn't that bad. Bad joke. [LAUGHS] Loree, you just have to learn to lighten up a little. That's all. You think you got a problem. I can't open up a jar of olives without doing 20 minutes on stuffing pimentos. Oh, wonderful, I can't laugh and you can't stop. I don't wanna stop. I like to laugh and I like to make people laugh. Laughing is a good thing, Loree. It's healthy. It's a good release. Come on, Loree. Make me laugh. [AIRPLANE ZOOMING] I can't. Sure, you can. Make me laugh. Tell me a joke. Stick a French fry in my ear. Do something. Come on. Is that it? Am I supposed to be laughing? Because if that's it, you're gonna have to work on it. Cut it out, Leo. It's bad enough you think I have no sense of humor. You don't have to put me on this spot and make fun of me. I'm sorry Loree. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] All right. You did it. She did it. She did it. Hollywood, California, listen to me. Loree Harper who previous to this day has been known as Glue Face, - has just made a funny. - [LAUGHS] Yes, a funny. Leo, sit down. What a day. I got an agent, you laughed. I don't feel like eating burritos. What do you feel like doing? Running around the base. Running around the base? LEO: And Larry Bowa, up in the bottom of the 9th, there's a shot in the right field corner. This could be trouble folks. He's rounding first, on his way to second. [CHEERING] All right. LEO: He's heading for third. Come on in. [CHEERING] He's gonna go all the way. Here's the throw. LOREE: Run. Way to go. [CHEERS] He's in there inside the park, homerun. And the crowd is going nuts. LOREE: [WHISTLING] Let's hear the crowd. [WHISTLING] - [CHEERS] - Yes. LOREE: Yeah, you did it. All right. - Hey, Leo. - I'm out of... [INDISTINCT] call the paramedics. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] LOREE: Just because you have an agent doesn't mean you're gonna start working right away. It doesn't matter. There are a lot of other things you can work on. Like fencing and... dancing classes. You mean discipline? That's what you're trying to say, right? LOREE: Yeah, discipline. Yeah. Well... that's why I got you for. What makes you think you got me? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] That's nice. Yeah? But you don't got me. Oh. You can keep on trying though. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Okay. I have a big day tomorrow. I have to go to work. I have to study my lines for our scene. My agent wants pictures, so I have to look into that. I'll see you tomorrow night in class, okay? [DOOR CLOSES] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] LOREE: [SCREAMS] Oh, Leo. I couldn't walk out on you like that. Oh, what are you doing? I wanna kiss goodbye. - LOREE: Okay. - BOTH: [CHUCKLE] I got it. 2:15 tomorrow, William Farrell Agency, 7480 Melrose Avenue, see Harry Crosby, you're looking for a funny pirate, right? Norman, this is great. Thank you so much. I won't let you down, babe. Okay. Jean, Jean, can you cover for me tomorrow? I got a commercial interview at 2:00. All right, go on. I'll think of something. Thanks, Jean. [FOOTSTEPS] WOMAN: You know, I've got to get learn this lines. - WOMAN: Yeah. - It's page 62. Got it. So where's Daffy Duck? Hmm, Daffy Duck. You know, that Looney Tune that Victor's had you working with these last few weeks. Leo. He'll be here in a few minutes. Cindy, he's not Looney Tune. Oh, come on. Loree, the guy belongs on Captain Kangaroo. He happens to be very sensitive, very talented actor. Okay. So he's a little over-enthusiastic, but he's not Looney Tune. Loree, hi. I know I'm late, I'm sorry. I got an audition tomorrow for a commercial, - my first one. Hi. - Hi. They're looking for a funny pirate. What do you think they mean by a funny pirate? Do you think I should use an accent? What kind of accent would a funny pirate use? I got to go outside and practice. Maybe I should limp like I've had my leg off in battle. Huh? Huh? [VOCALIZING LOONEY TUNES TUNE] [LAUGHS] CINDY: [INDISTINCT] that's all, folks. [CLEARS THROAT] Aye, hand me my NOEL calculator, matey, so's I can add me booty, four doubloons, three crowns, nine pearl necklaces. NOEL calculators, calculates anything accurately to the nearest doubloon. Seventeen diamonds [GRUNTS] Nine rubies. And cut. That's fine. Thank you, Leo. Is that it? Can I do one more? I just thought of a funny piece of business that might work here. That was fine the first time. Oh. Can we look at it? I'm sure you were fine the first time. We don't have time to look at all the tapes now. There are 75 other actors out there. We've got only two hours to see them. Would you send in the next one please, Karen? Thanks, Leo. You don't have to limp out. Was I limping? Oh, just a little. I forgot. - I'll see you soon. - Bye. I hope. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Loree, I don't understand it, I did it just like a pirate, what do they want? I don't know what they want. They don't know what they want. Yeah. But there's got a way to make an impression, like this guy there today, Loree, there was this guy dressed up just like a pirate, even had a parrot on his shoulder, where do you suppose he got a stuffed parrot, is there a place in town that actors go and get... Oh, Leo. Yeah. But I bet he gets the job because they'll remember him. I mean he had a parrot on his shoulder, that's not fair. CROWD: Shh. Okay. Ms. Ammonia Ferry, I have an audition for a doughnut commercial tomorrow. Now, you show me how you could convince some jerk that you can sell his hot jelly doughnuts. I told you before, there are no rules. You just go in and go for it. No, no, go ahead. I'm the client, do your stuff. Leo, we're gonna get ulcers. LEO: [SIGHS] Look, you go and wear your red shirt and they'll hire you, next time you go in wearing blue shirt and they won't hire you? Well, then you should stick with the red shirt. No. You're missing my point. Look, if there were an answer, we could time our careers. [SIGHS] Loree Harper, we're shooting this commercial on Thursday morning. What is your availability? How's your availability, Leo? [GRUNTS] Will you stop it? I'm serious. So am I. Why don't you come up to my place tonight and I can show you some real hot doughnuts. Loree, stop clowning. Ugh. Look who wants to stop clowning, the man who couldn't stop laughing. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Oh, God, I've turned the girl into a monster. You know what they say about the monster. What did they say about monsters? Come here and I'll show you. LEO: All right. Go easy on the neck. Nice. Nice. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] This is fantastic. I wonder if this is the way you're supposed to feel all the time, only we don't know it or we haven't gotten there yet. Like maybe we... [LAUGHING] What are you laughing at? I was just [INDISTINCT]. What were you gonna say? I wanted to tell you an important concept here. - Okay. - Now what's happening is that I think we're just high on consciousness, right? And when we're done smoking we're gonna fall back and I don't wanna fall back, how do you keep from falling back? [LAUGHING] You stay in love. Oh, yes, I should have known that. [LAUGHS] Thanks to you, I'm turning into a pretty flaky person. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Hey, what? Hey, I got you. Oh, yeah, you got me. Hmm, please stop biting your lip. [GROANS] Oh, Leo. [SHOUTS] [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Yes, I do. Thank you very much. Mr. Green? Yeah, that's me. They're ready to see you now for the mountain climbing commercial. Thanks. Good luck. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Oh, Leo, what are you doing here? Loree, I worked on this new routine. I wanna try it out on you. No, no, I can't let you, you [INDISTINCT] my facial. That was the idea. Oh, hell, I'm in a hurry. What's the rush? LOREE: The rush is my interview this afternoon. Where do you have to go? LOREE: Burbank Studios. What did you say it was for? LOREE: I didn't say. It's a TV pilot. How the hell am I supposed to look like a young Southern belle? Without the facial, you got a chance. [GRUNTS] Maybe you can change it to Pittsburg. The Phils won. LOREE: Phil who got what part? No, the Phillies, it's a baseball team. They won three to two. Big deal, y'all. How's the accent? What accent? I hate you. [PHONE RINGS] LOREE: Will you get that? You want me to get that? LOREE: I just said that, sweetie pie. That was pretty good. [PHONE RINGING] Miss Loree's residence y'all. NORMAN: Leo, don't you ever go home. I've been calling your place all morning. Hey, Norman, what's up? NORMAN: You've got the part, Schmuck. I did? I got the part? Who is it Leo? Loree, I got the part. - I got the part. - Oh. [PANTS] What part did I get? - NORMAN: The doughnut spot. - The doughnut spot. - I got the doughnut spot. - Great. Norman, I got to thank you. NORMAN: Just enjoy yourself, Leo. I'll call you later with the details. - I got to run. - He's got to run. I got the part! I got the part! I was cruddy on that interview. Oh, congratulations. Let's fake the kiss. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] What'd you do, put the make on the director? [GRUNTS] My facial. I got the part! I got the part. I got the part. I got to go to a bakery and study doughnuts. But Mr. Bennet, you don't understand. This is national exposure. You don't understand, this is ice cream, it has to be served to people who wanna buy it. I know, but it's just a day, one day. Every time I come in here, you're out running some place. Yeah. But you see, I'm just starting to click. Click on your own time. This is such a chance for me Mr. Bennet. I need this job. What job, Green? That job or this one? Take your pick. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Okay. We have to black kid and the yellow kid and the white kid. MAN: Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] No, no, no. No. Don't worry about that. It won't be on the shot. I'm not shooting in CinemaScope for Christ's sake. Excuse me? Yeah. I'm Leo Green. So? Well, I'm gonna... I'm supposed to be in this doughnut commercial. I am in the right place. Oh, Leo. - The funny kid. - The funny kid. - How are you? - I'm fine. Thank you. I'm Verne Harris. Right. I remember. I'm directing this little epic. [LAUGHS] Right. - Porky. - Hmm? What in the name of [INDISTINCT] is this? - It's a tablecloth. - Not in my commercial, honey. - Oh, man. - I need colors, sweetheart. This is supposed to be bright and funny. Okay. Now what was your name again? - Leo Green. - Of course, Leo, Leo Green. Leo, why don't you go over to that table, they'll make you up and get you ready. - Make me up? - Uh-hmm. Just a touch. - Oh, makeup, oh, yeah. Right. - Yeah. - Okay. Right over there? - Uh-hmm. - Thanks a lot. - Uh-hmm. Porky. Hi, how are doing? This is so great. It's my first commercial. Leo, hi. Bob Stanley with the Sharp Ad Agency. Oh, yeah, nice to... nice to meet you. You, too. Have you seen the storyboard? Uh, no, I don't think so. I'll run it down with you while you're getting made up. Oh, good, thanks. Here you go. Could you hold up a little higher? - Oh, sure. Sorry. - Oh, yeah, great. [HORN HONKING] Uh-oh, here comes Dragon Lady. What the hell are you doing? That's my spot, you slink, get out of here. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] For Christ's sake that's all I need that somebody going in my parking place, what the [INDISTINCT] somebody get me a cold drink for Christ's sake. All right, down. This is, gang. We can do it right. Everybody's set, beautiful, wonderful good luck. Come on, get in there, will you? For [INDISTINCT] sakes. Roll them. Speed. Action. Quick now, what's your favorite Mommy Odelle Donut? I love the creamy cream. I love the huicy hellies. I love the fluffy glaze. DIRECTOR: Cut! Cut! No, no, no can you say juicy jellies? Yes, huicy hellies. No, no, no. Juicy jellies. Huicy hellies. Right. Can you say uicy... - juicy jellies? - Juicy jellies. Good, good. You take the juicy jelly line and you take the fluffy glazed line. Okay, let's switch the donuts, kids. Come on, we can do it. Great. Okay. Let's go kids, come on. Let's go, you can do it. No, J's. You can't screw that one up. All right. Roll them. Speed. Action. MAN: Quick now, what's your favorite Mommy Odelle Donut? I love the creamy cream. I love the juicy jelly. I love the fluffy glaze. I can't pick, I love them all. Hi, folks. This is Mommy Odelle. - Hi, mommy. - Hi, mommy. Ha, ha. As you all know, I only use the freshest, most natural ingredients in my donuts. But I've got to warn you, if you're thinking of picking a favorite, that's a darn near impossible thing to do. And cut. Oh, jelly, beautiful. All right. Got to do for [INDISTINCT] come on, let's move in for the close-ups. MOMMY ODELLE: Get out of here, you bum, you flake. You're ruining my hair. Don't touch me. Surprise. Loree, what are you doing here? I hope you don't mind. The building manager let me in, and I wanted to fix you dinner. Come here. You hungry? I don't know. - Hey. - Yes, yes, I'm hungry. I can't believe you. You want a donut? No. Lookie, spaghetti. [LAUGHTER] It is good. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] LOREE: This is for you. What are you doing? A laurel for your victory today. All right. I can't believe I did it. Loree, I felt it was in the movies. They had all these people running around me. The guy with the sticks. - Yeah, clap board. - Clap board, right. And then, came up with this little thing where I put chocolate around my mouth, you know, the director loved it. He said, he wanted to work with me again. He loved my red hair, colors, colors, colors. Leo, sit down. Yeah. I'm sorry. I can't wait until it's on the air. In the meantime, maybe you can get your job back at the ice cream place. Nah, the boss has had it with me. He doesn't understand show business. So, as I see it, since you'll probably evicted, you have a few choices. You could move in to the Y, or, um... move in to the Salvation Army, or you could move in with me. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Um... I don't think I want to eat anymore. Me neither. What do you feel like doing? Um... uh, I feel, like, making love to you. Really? Really. Oh, sounds nice. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye. LEO: I can't pick them, I love them all. Loree, Loree. I found out my commercial is going on the air. June 28th, 8:15 on ABC. Coast to coast. I did it, yes! I decided you were right about not taking an ad out in Variety, but I got this idea. I'm getting these post cards made up with my picture on it with a little note to send to all the casting people in town and everyone back home, listen to this, okay? Listen, see Leo Green dominate the screen, funniest guy you've ever seen. Then, Mommy Odelle's Donuts, 8:15, blah, blah, blah. What do you think? Huh? I already ordered it. Leo. I've got the pilot. The TV pilot? Yeah. You mean, you didn't even have to test work? Uh-uh. That's really something. They must've really wanted you. Hold me. Oh. LEO: This could be it for you. I'm stunned. Can we celebrate? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. I mean, this is no rinky-dink donut commercial. This is big time. We're gonna celebrate. Where do you wanna go? You name it. Del Taco. Del Taco. This is great. This is better than Philadelphia. You jog in Atlantic City, all you get is splinters. Mom called this morning. She heard about the TV pilot. She invited herself for dinner, Saturday night. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - That sounds good. - You wanna go? Sure. I think it will be fun for the three of us - to have dinner together. - Okay. As long as you don't talk about business. Well, don't worry. We'll talk about something else. Yeah, yeah, - we can talk about you and me. - Yeah, wait a minute. Just how much are you gonna tell her? The whole thing. Wait a minute. What do you mean the whole thing? Wait a minute. Wait, you can't tell her everything. Yes, I can. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Oh, thank you, Maria. It's just lovely. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] Maria. Mexican help is wonderful. Castilian. Where was I? Oh, yes. I'm sending Helena over Loree. Right, mom. Don't bite your lip, darling. Oh, this little TV series could lead you to bigger things. Features, well, what do you think, Leo? Absolutely. Mom, I didn't come here to talk about business. There's something I wanted to tell you about. It's Leo and me. You mean, that you're living together? [PLATES CLATTER] Jesus, I feel like I'm living in a goddamn fish bowl. What? I'm not spying on you, Loree. If that's what you mean. Oh, it's just every time I call, Leo is there. I just assumed... well, you are living together. Yes, damn it. We are. I saw your Oscar. It's heavier than it looks. Excuse me. Don't go anywhere, okay? Loree. LOREE: Ever since I was two years old, she's been doing it. - LEO: Well, just try one time. - LOREE: You don't know, Leo you don't know what it's like to grow up in this environment. Hold on for another second, okay? LOREE: [INDISTINCT] I can't calm down. LEO: All right. All right. Hold it. Just sit down, thank you. Oh, okay. Now, I don't mean to interfere. Well, yes. I guess, I do mean to interfere. I'm interfering now, okay? I don't know the two of you very long but it just seems to me that there's a lot of distance between you two at this table. I mean, my dad and I used to talk a lot of things out at the dinner table, you know? Not always nice. Sometimes, we'd yell and scream at each other but at least, we were face-to-face and you work things out that way. You know, so, well, I think, maybe, we could try to set something like that up here, okay? Um, just move this out of the way for a second. Here we go. And just down here, trust me. Yeah. Okay. Come on, sit over here, okay? All right. Mrs. Harper, I'll help you. This side of the table is really good, I think you will like it. You look beautiful. Better than your movies even, you know? Oh. Okay. How is that? Loree. Do you think, you could turn around a little? I think, it's a little better if you turn, come on. Here you go. We'll talk later. How's this? Good. This is very good. All right. I'll leave you alone just for a minute, okay? I'm gonna get a bite to eat with Maria in the kitchen. Excuse me, do you think I could take this in the kitchen and eat, its candle light, it would be great. You got one. Maria, we're gonna have burritos? MARIA: Burritos? I don't know how to make burritos. Do you want some paella? We're not having burritos, we're having pie. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] - Mom. - Loree. [CHUCKLES] She's gonna miss it. NARRATOR: We'll be back with our movie of the week, but first, a word from our sponsor. MAN: Quick now, what's your favorite Mommy Odelle Donut? I love the creamy cream. I love the juicy jelly. I love the fluffy glazed. MOMMY ODELLE: Hi, folks. This is Mommy Odelle. ALL: Hi, mommy. MOMMY ODELLE: As you all know, I use only the most natural and the freshest ingredients in my donut. But I've got to warn you, when it comes to picking a favorite, it's darn near impossible. # Try Mommy Odelle's # Buy Mommy Odelle's fresh donuts # LOREE: I am sorry, Leo. I got held up at work. So [INDISTINCT] Oh my God, I missed it. How was it? They cut me out. How can they cut me out? I was right there. I was right in the middle of them, I know those people. I put the chocolate up, remember I, I did the commercial. It happens all the time. Would you do me a favor? Yeah. Can you turn it off? [THUNDER RUMBLES] Hi, Dad. I'm fine. I got your letter today. Why all of a sudden you're sending me a check? Yeah. Yeah. I can use it. But... Dad, I didn't lie to you. I did the commercial. They just cut me out at the last minute. I have no control over something like that. Oh, well, I'm real sorry that you went and told everyone about it. Yeah. I'm sorry. You felt foolish, how do you think I feel? Listen to me, damn it. I didn't lie to you. I'll talk to you any way I want to talk. Yeah. Talking. I'm sorry. I'm talking... I'm talking in a normal voice now, okay? No. No, I'm not moving back. I don't care how much teachers are making. Dad, instead of sending me money, why don't you just tell me that you're behind me for once instead of bringing me down all the time? I'm not gonna cash that stupid check. And I didn't lie to you. [BELL RINGS] LOREE: Honey, I've been waiting in the car 20 minutes. I'm due at my conference now. Uh-oh. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Talk with your dad didn't go too well? [SIGHS] Mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Hey, pretty good. You win a bottle of wine. Thanks. You know, I was reading in Variety the other day about this actor. He walked out on a series because they wouldn't give him his own souped-up mobile dressing room. - Honey, don't... - And another actor who won't do a show unless he gets his own limousine. How the hell can these people ask for stuff like that? They're lucky they're working. LOREE: Drop it. What are you doing tomorrow? LEO: I got a commercial call. GE light bulbs or something. Then I'm going to the travel agent to pick up the tickets for our trip. Aspen will be beautiful. Oh, God. I can't wait. It'll be so great just to get out of town - for a while. - I know. Hmm, you smell nice. - Oh, good. Uh, Leo. - Yes, sir? Why don't you and Loree rehearse your scene? - I'll be back in a few minutes. - Oh, I don't know the lines yet. I didn't have a chance to lock him in. What are you worried about, Loree? You're a big TV star now, right Leo? - That's right. - [CHUCKLES] Leo. Let's head up to the scene. Honey? Honey, honey. We have to go for a meeting. Yeah, I know. I came down to see you. They wouldn't even let me on the set. Oh, wait. I got something to tell you. They sold the series. - What? - Yeah. The network saw the run throug hand they love it. And they want us to go into production three weeks after we finish shooting the pilot. That's great. Three weeks, you're gonna be swamped. Loree, I'm so glad we're going away together. It's perfect timing. We're gonna need this vacation. No, I need it, but I'm... not gonna get it. Aspen's out. Out? What do you mean out? Well, the network is so hot on the show that they want Jeff and me... oh, honey, your nails are dirty. They want Jeff and me to go on a two-week promotional tour. Now? I can't believe this. You and Jeff? Oh, that's great. Honey, look, I have it all figured out. Halfway through the tour, Jeff and I have a couple of days off in Denver, so you can fly in and meet me and I can pay for the ticket and everything. How about that, a trip for me. - Yeah. - All expenses paid... - Yeah. - ...with you and Jeff. Do I bring a date or do we play mixed triples? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. What do you want me to do? Loree, I never see you anymore. I just... I just wanted us to be alone... in Aspen, that's all. Well, me too. But I didn't plan, it's business. All right. Let's just do this. Let's just do this lousy scene before the class comes back, okay? I know the lines. Fine. - Stop it. - Stop what? - Stop acting like this. - How am I acting? - Like a martyr. - Yeah, that's me. You wanna know you, "I'll leave a meal ticket? I'll pay for the tickets. I'll pay for everything." What, is paying gonna make everything okay, Loree? LOREE: I'm sorry. Next time, I won't offer. Honey, you're being irrational. LEO: Yes, I am. And that's how I feel. I'm saying what I feel... okay? You know, Leo, this business has sucked - it right out of you. - LEO: That's right. You're the one that said you never wanted to stop laughing, - well, you stop. - LEO: That's right. And you've picked up the slack, haven't you? - Leo. - I wanna talk about it, okay? Don't avoid the issue. Loree, shut up. You know, ever since I've started this pilot, you've been an unsupportive bastard. Bravo. Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. That's what you call acting. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Rent went up five bucks, kid. Yeah. You better hurry. Couple of people looking yesterday. Sorry, I got my things in the car. [SIGHS] Glad to see you haven't changed the classic antique decor, Mr. Kleinman. You know what else hasn't changed kid? First month in advance. Uh-huh. Yeah. [CARS REVVING] That was pretty good, huh? Great, Dennis. It's really good. - Where are you going? - Come on, Dennis. This is California. They give you a ticket for crossing in the middle of the street, you know. It's all right. It's all right. Excuse me. Thank you. Dennis, I really wish you'd let me pay for my part of the lunch. - Listen, will you forget it? - What? [HORN HONKS] [CHUCKLES] Listen, we're celebrating my promotion, remember? Your promotion. Yeah. [CARS REVVING] All right. So you wouldn't tell me anything at lunch. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good, Dennis. Yeah, I might be doing this play over at the Tower Theater and I did another commercial. This time they didn't cut me out. I unclogged a stuffy drain. And I heard about some replacements. They're gonna be replacing people - on Saturday Night Live and... - Leo. ...I'm gonna get an interview for that. - Leo. - What? You're lying. Dennis. No, no, I'm not lying. I'm doing great. Look, see that? My agent. My agent, how you doing, babe? Why don't you ever call me? I never hear from you anymore. All right. You're a busy guy, I know that. Give me a call when you're free. Doesn't dress too good. But he's a good agent. All right. I'm doing lousy. Yes. My life is over. I have no career. DENNIS: The humor's definitely from desperation. What's your problem? Dennis, you wanna know what the problem is? Yeah. I used to believe in myself. I mean, I used to have a feeling where I just... I just knew, you know. I come out here and I don't know anymore. I don't even know if I ever knew. I mean, maybe I've just been kidding myself all these years. Like, it's been a big dream or something. You know, that's what kills me, it's that self-doubt. I just can't... I can't handle that. It... Talked to anybody about this? Like, Loree? Have you talked to Loree about it? No, I haven't seen her for a while. Well, our firm just signed to do her publicity. Do you want me to mention you to her? No, I don't want you to talk to her about me, okay? You're gonna do a publicity, huh? Yeah. That's great for both of you. She's gonna be a big star. Call classified and tell them we have a nice room for a clean boarder. But mom's a wonderful housekeeper. She can help with the cooking and... She can take care of the dogs. And she can take care of the dogs. Look, if we're gonna do this, let's do it right. Learn your damn lines, man. JEFF: Well, I just got the pages this morning. So did I and I've been in makeup since... I'm sorry, I can't work like this. Sorry. [SIGHS] Okay. All right. All right. Let's take an hour for lunch. [FOOTSTEPS] Well, thanks again for lunch, Dennis. It's nice to see how the other half lives. Your offices are in here? Yes. This is terrific. A movie theater? Why don't you try calling her. A bar. What Loree? - Yes. - No. That's over. Over and out. Well, listen, I didn't bring you all the way over here just to buy you an expensive lunch. Which you'll deduct from your expense account. Which I'll deduct from my expense account. Since they moved me up, my old job is open. - Oh, yeah? - You want it? [CHUCKLES] What me? Are you kidding, Dennis? A job like that takes an organized mind like you. I'm a slob. I think you'd be good on the job, and you need steady. [CHUCKLES] No way. No. If I'm gonna give it up, I'll move back home and teach English to a bunch of bored 10th graders. Not so interesting. Yeah. I'll tell you what you do, don't think of it as permanent, just think of this as a temporary job. Let me ask you something. When you took that job, did you think of it as permanent? No. I didn't. No, I didn't think so. You see, now that's what I'm afraid of. But I'll tell you what I soon found out was permanent. A businessman in a plaid suit and a briefcase, now that's permanent. There are 20,000 members of screen actors' guild and less than one percent, one percent, Leo, earn enough to live on. The rest of the 19,800, huh? They're lucky if they earn a couple of hundred a year if they earn that. Now that's not a pretty picture, Leo. - But that's what's permanent. - Yeah. You're in the business that's gonna eat you alive. [CAR REVVING] Got to go. [FOOTSTEPS] Dennis. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, don't go to work this afternoon. Let's go to the park and play some ball. I got my glove in the trunk. I bet you even brought one for me too, didn't you? Of course. Damn. I'd love to. Let's go. I can't. I've got an appointment and I'm already late. Wait a minute. Dennis, wait. Let's do something normal. I wanna do something normal, like, go to the beach, you know. Let's get a few quarts of beer and chug them down like we used to, remember? I'll belch for you. Now you always loved that. [CHUCKLES] I'd love to. But I've got to go work. [SIGHS] All right. - Stay in touch. - Sure. Listen, if Tony Schule wants to do a revival of California, Here I Come, tell him I'm available. Oh, right. He's coming, don't worry. Only I'm in the union now, I get paid scale. Union? The Belcher's Union? I do the jokes, Dennis.

Good. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Who's it for? Tony Schule's doing a Larry Russo pilot and called my agent. He remembered me from his party. Can you believe that? I acted like a horse's patooty at his party. Yeah. You did. [CHUCKLES] [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah. Sit down. Thanks. What kind of a part is it? Well, it's this guy who's, well, he's sort of a... horse's patooty. I guess he's going for typecasting, huh? I just wanted to go over it with someone and you were the first person I thought of. Well, actually, you were the only person I thought of. Look, if you wanna throw me out right now, I'll understand. No. Would you like some coffee? - Yeah. Okay. - Good. I'll get you some coffee and then we can read through the script. MAN: Hey Larry, this kid I told you about, I hate him. Does jokes better than I do. LEO: [CHUCKLES] Not really. You got the whole stage. And you can begin any time you want, right Larry? - Uh-hmm. - Take your time. Okay. So, this will be my bedroom closet? No, no, no. This is your bedroom. You passed the closet on the way in. - Where? - Well, you see that side of that steam pipe running along the wall? - Yeah. - Well, that's your closet. LEO: What makes you think I'm gonna move in here? TONY: Well, I know your mother. Believe me, you wanna move out. Yeah, you know, you're probably right about that. I'm old enough now. I should demand what's mine, right? - David? - Coming mom. Mr. Mantie, I think I better think about this a little bit... Okay. That's fine right there, Leo. - Good reading. - MANTIE: Very nice, Leo. Um, thank you but we didn't get to the end. - Do you think, um... - We've seen enough. - We'll be in touch. - Excuse me, sir. But you see, we're coming to the ending - and I was working on this real. - Leo, we have a lot of people to see. So why don't you just go ahead. You did very well. Okay? Okay. So I wanna see someone [MUMBLES] Uh, you can go now, Leo. [MUMBLES] Damn it. No. I'm not going. All right. All right. Just listen to me a second. Okay? I got something to say. You guys are having an audition here, right? Actors come in here to... they come in here to try to prove to you that they're the right guy for the part, right? Well, that's all I want, is a chance to prove... I'm, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm really sorry. I just... I believe that I... Leo. No, no. Wait a minute, Tony. Leo wants to finish, let him finish. Go ahead, Leo, finish. No, no. It's all right. You've seen enough. Hi. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Were you over at my place this morning? Yeah. Did we go through some lines? Yeah. I thought so. I felt good all day long. You did? Why are we living at opposite ends of town? I don't know, Loree. I think maybe if we were living at the same end of town together, we'd drive each other crazy. And it doesn't matter anymore because I'm getting out of here. Where are you going? To Philadelphia where the people are made of flesh and blood or a reasonable facsimile. The audition didn't go too well? Oh, no. It went great. If all the other actors who auditioned die I get the part. What happened? I told them off. That's what happened. So just because of that you're quitting? My dad was right. I'm now going to drive 3,000 miles across the country and get myself a normal respectable teaching job. The hell you are. You wanna help me pack? No, I don't wanna help you pack. What are you doing? Will you leave my clothes alone? I can't let you do this, Leo. I can't take this anymore. Don't you know you're the only good thing that's happened to me out here? And I can't take... what are you doing? That's all my... I packed all this. No. Leo, I came over here to see if you'd take me back. When we were together, I was doing my best work and I was a halfway decent person to be with. Now, all I do is nag on the set, and during my free time I keep catching myself looking at that stupid baseball pennant on the wall. Take it down. I did that. I took it down three times and I put it back up three times. I know it was my fault we broke up. Wait a minute. It wasn't your fault. It was my fault. Okay. It was your fault. Wait a minute. It was a little bit your fault. Never mind whose fault it was. Leo, I love you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I love you too. I just can't stay here anymore. Why? Loree, don't you understand? I'm a fraud. I don't belong here. Everyone else knew that I never had it and I never knew it, and now, I know it. Bullshit, Leo Greene. Never mind what anybody else thinks you ought to be doing with your life. You gotta keep listening to what you wanna do. Don't quit on yourself now. [SIGHS] I don't know what to do. I don't know anymore. I just don't know what to do. It's what you have me for? You mean, I still have you? If you want me. Oh, God. Do I want you? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] LOREE: Your phone. LEO: I know. LOREE: Aren't you gonna get it? LEO: No. No. [PHONE RINGING] LOREE: Oh, it's distracting. - Hello. - Hang up. Yes. Wait. No, no, wait a minute. It's your agent. I don't care. Hang up. He sounds excited. Hang up. Don't you wanna talk to him? No. Hang up. [SIGHS] Okay. [SIGHS] Norman, I'm sorry. Leo doesn't want to talk to you. Wait, wait. I'll talk to him. Norman, I know what happened. I... what's up? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, gosh. I got the part. You got the part? - I got the part. - You got the part. [CHUCKLES] I'm here. Norman! Norman! [LAUGHS] All right. All right. Here's what I want. My own mobile dressing room if we go on location, script approval, and if the series goes more than three years I get a picture deal. That's right. Norman, hang on for a second. Tell him "Forget what I've just said." Forget what I just said. Tell him you really want the part. I really want the part. Say, uh, "Make the best deal you can." Make the best deal you can. Call me when you hear something. Call me when you hear something. And say thank you. And say thank you. No. Thank you, Norman. Thank you, Norman. Now hang up. Now hang up. Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Don't be a horse's patooty. Don't bite your lips. [LAUGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] # Don't tell me there's a heaven # # Then deprive me of a star # Don't show me a horizon # And then say I reached too far # # I don't want no hand-me-down # # That somebody's worn # If life's a gambler's paradise # # I'm[INDISTINCT] # # Oh, I only want what's mine # # Nothing more # Nothing less # I only want what's mine # Nothing short or nothing less # # And just because your love can keep you # # Why don't you [INDISTINCT] # # But that don't mean I won't # # Be fighting anymore # And if I will see the world # # Through someone else's eyes # # Just give me your blessing # # You can keep your compromise # # Yesterday was yours tomorrow # # Now belongs to me # I know exactly what I'm going to say # To destiny # Oh, I only want what's mine # # Nothing more # Nothing less # I only want what's mine # Nothing short or nothing
