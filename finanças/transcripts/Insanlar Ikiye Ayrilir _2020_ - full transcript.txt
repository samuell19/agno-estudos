In a land far far away, there was a girl... called Cinderella who has a legendary beauty. One day, she received great news. In his castle, Prince Charming of the country... Prince Charming! Prince Charming was planning to throw a ball... in order to find the girl he was going to marry. However, Cinderella had no clothes to wear... let alone a car to take her to the ball. -Right at that moment... -Kapital Fairy! To cover Cinderella’s needs... Shush you, you didn’t stop gabbing since I don't know when. Darling, you come here now. Now you go and buy whatever you need. Don't wait for fairy godmother for your needs. Just come to Kapital Bank. Take your Kapital Card. Use it safely for all your needs... from education to transportation, holiday to investments... Leave the rest to your bank. Kapital Bank. TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE She's not here yet? Hello? Miss Müge? We are in the room. Please take your time. We are waiting for you. I swear you made me regret it. You bit off more than you could chew and now both you and I are in shit. I treated you well, gave you a job, gave you bread, was that a mistake? Look, don't say anything stupid! Just answer what she has to ask and nothing more. This is your shit, you’ll clean it up. If I have to close down my business because of you... I swear I won't leave it unpunished. Your colleagues said this room was available, so here we are. That's fine. Where shall I sit? Wherever. Are you OK? I am fine. I have a headache. I took a painkiller, it should be fine soon. You are OK to speak? Yes, yes, no problem. It’s not that bad. OK. We’re starting right away? Are we waiting for someone? No. So... Miss Duygu, Mr. Eray must have explained. I am conducting an investigation on behalf of the bank. That's why we asked you to here today. The management is concerned with what happened. Rightfully, they demand to learn what happened. So I’m going to ask you everything about this case from the beginning. I believe you will cooperate. Of course. After everything happened, it makes no sense to hide things, right? Yes. June 3rd, 2019, Maslak, Istanbul. Duygu Tüzel's statement. If you don't deposit by Friday, it will fall into the court of bailiff. I couldn’t get my salary on time. Otherwise, you know I’d never delay the payment. Of course. If you don’t make the payment, legal process may start any moment. If that once happens, even I cannot help you anymore. I understand. Thank you. Yes, mum? No I'm outside, what happened? No, I don’t think that it is important. Don't open it, mum. Put it on my desk I'll take a look tonight. Did you sign anything? OK, mum, OK. Mum, my bus is here. I'll call you later OK? Kisses. I'm sorry. No problem at all. Please follow me. It’s a standard contract. The most important part is on the last page, the payment schedule. We kept it at a minimum already. Could we turn on the AC please, it's too hot in here? Unfortunately the remote is broken. There won't be any problem... if you pay the installments on time, Miss Ceren. But we have to get a down payment from you. On the phone, you said you could give me a discount. Yes, I am already doing that. I'll give you a 12 months extension as well. But a minimum amount... has to be paid. If only I had that amount... Don't you have some friend or older brother who could support you? No? Well, you sign the contract now, and let us discuss this internally. We’ll see if we can postpone the advance payment. Duygu, could you come here for a second? I'll be right back. Don't sign it. Excuse me? Don't sign it. She can't do anything if you don't sign. But if you sign, you'll have to pay all of it. But isn’t this the last day for the discount? There's no discount. She could write off all the interest if she wanted. She could postpone the due date, even reduce the debt but if you sign it now and don't pay, you'll end up in jail. I’m just saying by the way. It’s up to you. -What should I do now? -She's coming! I'm really sorry. They mixed the files going to the bailiff's. Are we done now, did you sign it? Wait a second. Just walk me through again. The interview you had with Miss Ceren on April 15th, was it your first one? First one, face to face. We had spoken on the phone before. Debtor refused the sign the contract. Yes. Does this happen often? It's rare for someone to say yes on the phone... and then refuse to sign after coming here. Did that make you suspicious? Yes, it did. And another thing. The temperature on the AC had dropped. What does the AC have to do with this? During the interviews, we sometimes heat up the rooms... in order to persuade the debtor. Anything else? Anything unusual with Mr. Bahadir's behavior? Everybody was tense to hit their quota before the premiums. But of course, this has nothing to do with the quota. Miss Duygu, you go on please. No, nothing like that. I've been giving you every penny I earn for the last two years. Don’t you have mercy, any decency in you at all? I couldn’t pay for one month only! One month! Could you just calm down Mr. Feridun? Calm down! Why should I calm down? You ruined my reputation to all my relatives! How can I calm down? You didn’t answer our calls, that’s why we had to call them. This is my debt! How on earth, can you call my brother? Who gives you the right to do that? Look, I’m not kidding! If you ever call my mother, father or my relatives again, I’ll burn this place down! What's going on there? What does he say? We couldn't convince him to come for a meeting. He’s threatened us because we called his family, Mr. Eray. -He can't do shit. Just fuck him. -He says he's gonna report us. Well good luck for him. Did he consult me while spending all that money! Let's go to the restroom and splash your face, darling. He keeps saying, why are you calling my brother. As if I enjoy doing that... They tell me to do it, so I do it. I don’t enjoy calling his brother! He keeps swearing Duygu, why would you do that? Don’t mind what he says, why do you care so much? He said, I hope your children will suffer your actions. Isn’t that too vile to say? Nothing will happen to my baby, right? Don’t talk rubbish Tilbe! That’s not up to him. -It won’t happen, right? -No, it won’t love. Don’t worry. I can't stand anymore. I'll quit. What are you talking about, you're gonna be on a maternal leave soon anyway. Nope. When the premiums are calculated, I'll quit. I can't take it anymore. OK, just wash your face now... and calm down. I’ll get you a nice cup of coffee in a moment, ok? Did my eyes get all red? Correct me if I'm wrong. All the employees receive... -training before they start, right? -Yes. So, you have been told that you... cannot have a personal relationship with a debtor, right? Yes. And yet you contacted Miss Ceren. Who called first? You or her? She called first. We talked for two minutes tops. Who offered to meet? I can't remember. Me, I guess. -Thanks. -Thanks. I’ve never felt that helpless before. I’m scared of the phone, scared that she will call. -Yes. Duygu's a go-getter. -I don’t know about that. But she literally haunts my dreams. She's trying to reach her target. Is that why she got angry when I didn't sign? She gets premiums accordingly. But you did the right thing. You can bargain forever as long as you don’t sign. -You say so? -Uh-huh. But she said I could’t get a discount on the interest if I don’t sign. Don’t you buy it! If you don't pay, she'll have to... give you a reduction from the initial debt as well. What happens if I can't pay that too? Nothing. You pay whatever you can. For once, let her, not hit her target. Is that why you help me? No, not because of that. Then why? I know how it’s like to be in dire straits. Not everything's about money. -Thank you. -No problem. No, thank you for real. If it weren’t for you, I would sign it in a heartbeat. No problem. If she calls, don't answer. Which she will. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers, either. OK, I won’t pick up. Can you give me your phone, Tilbe? What are you gonna do? I'm trying to call that girl from other day but she doesn’t pick up. No answer? Nope. Until the day we met, she was answering all my calls... was ready to do whatever I say, but then all of a sudden she disappeared. Miss Ceren! Miss Ceren! Yes? I've been trying to reach you for days now. OK but why do you come here? You don't respond to my calls, my texts... so I had to come all the way up here. I was busy, I had no time to call really. It’s OK. But we have to talk. I know this is weird catching you getting out of work and all... I get it, I'll call you tomorrow or whenever I’m available. Just a second, I know it seemed like I put pressure on you the other day... -I need to take this bus... -but if you let me explain... Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I’ll call you. I'll explain if you listen for a moment. Miss Ceren, Ceren! I'm trying to tell you something, for your own good. Don't sign it. She can't do anything if you don't sign. If you sign, you'll have to pay all of it. But this is the last day for the discount? -What the hell is this? -Just give me five minutes... If you're not convinced, you can take the next bus. I know it sounds ridiculous but everything you see... in that room has been rehearsed they’ve all been planned beforehand. The room temperature... making you wait at the corridor... me leaving the room... all planned. -OK but why? -To persuade you. Look. Interviewers play good cop, bad cop. After I put pressure on you, I was supposed to leave the room... and the good cop was supposed to convince you to pay. But this time, it didn’t happen like that. No it didn’t. And I knew it wouldn't anyways. How did you know? Because whenever a young beautiful woman comes in... these sons of bitches just can’t keep it in. This is the list of debtors we interviewed together... in the last quarter. Have a look. 141 people. We have failed only 12 out of 141. 10 of them are your age. All women, all single. How do you know they are single? We receive all kinds of information from the bank. All your relatives, addresses, debts, receipts, everything... How stupid am I. I thought... You thought he helped you because he liked you. Don't blame yourself. They train us to manipulate you. No, I'm not famous for making good decisions anyway. I'll do whatever I can to help you with the debt. I promise. But you are going to help me as well. What kind of help? -Yes! -Woo! You can't be playing this for the first time! You've set me up. I swear it's my first time. Come on, girl. Cool moves, slides, artistic throws and everything. I get it, you're a wizard of it. I gave you an advance just because you're a newbie. But no more mercy! Come on! Now you're only fooling yourself, it's just a dinner after all. Get over it! Come on! -Don't laugh. -Sorry. You know I'm a poor fella, and now you'll make me pay for dinner. Excuse me, it's me who went bankrupt, and you’re the poor one? You're an entrepreneur. You had money and you managed to go bankrupt. I'm just a poor labourer who works from 9 to 6. Yeah, right. You push people in need, take premiums and then call yourself a poor fella. I don't work there because I enjoy it. I'm joking! You've helped me so much... I can't pay you back. Dinner’s on me! Fairy godmother is the villain in that tale. Why? What did she do to be the villain? If she meant to help, she would help properly. But she says, you need to come back at 12, you'll have a glass shoe and such. Come on, you dress up, you put on makeup, spend money, ask for her help... and the Capital Mother ends up being the guilty one! What's the difference between that and a usurer? One of them shoots you in the ankle when your payment is late... and the other one takes all you’ve got, even your shoes. What is he talking about, Kapital Fairy or something? Chit chat. You know that credit card commercial. Why do you talk about that? I was just trying to make him talk about the bank. It's too noisy, I can't understand anything. Look. Look. The side with mic should face him. Don't put it on anything, there shouldn't be anything between him and the phone. Just put it like this. -Sure but here's noisy as well. -It doesn't matter. There will always be people around. And obviously you won't be going to his place... Does he still text you all the time? Non-stop. Sorry that he’s troubling you. Well, actually he's kinda funny. Is he? Sure but here's noisy as well. It doesn't matter. There will always be people around. And obviously you won't be going to his place... This much is enough. You didn't feel that she was trying to... make you talk, fishing for something? No. We were seeing each other. She was calling, we were dating... I didn't notice anything fishy. And at the office? Something strange on Duygu's side? In our business you don’t get friendly with your colleagues. You do your job and go home. Duygu was like she always was. -Excuse me. -Yes? When will the seminar begin? It starts in half an hour. Brother Sedat, could you turn the lamps down a bit? "EFFICIENT COLLECTING METHODS ON THE PHONE – Eray EGE" You can wait in the lobby if you like. -Shall I take a look? -It got my money. There's no light, I guess the coin did not drop. We had the same machine in our university. It stole so much money from me. -Did you fix it? -I guess so. How did you do that? Let’s say “experience” Thank you very much. You're great. No problem. -Are you here for the training as well? -Yes. I'm Tilbe. Pleasure to meet you. And I am Duygu. Pleasure to meet you as well. Do you know how many people will they hire? I don’t know but it’s crowded. What do philosophy graduates do? They take a pedagogical formation and become a teacher. But of course there are never enough positions to apply. If I had a degree, I guess I would’ve liked to practice what I studied. Yes, but I’ve been waiting for three years. I need to find something steady. I can't pay the rent by being a hostess at the fairs. I did that too. Product promotion, sausage tasting, play-teach stuff. Where did you do that? Admin Agency? Yep, you too? But I couldn't get my last payment. They still owe me 1500 TL as well. -1500 TL? -Yes. He’s been stalling me off for months. Asshole. Don't you think the owner of the place is kind of a pervert? Yeah, for sure, he's a pervert... -Yeah? -You felt it too. We are starting in five. Who has a credit card here? Anyone who at least once paid the credit card installments late? Anyone who had a credit card that was prosecuted? Let's see them. Don't be shy. Nice. You know the drill. That's a good thing. DEBTOR This man here. He took a loan, he started a business, took out a mortgage, went on a holiday or whatever... BANK BANK He rightfully wants his money back. So, where do we stand in that equation? Here. CREDITOR You already know... the man on the left feels, thinks. Here we teach you to be the guy in the middle. MANAGING DEBTOR PSYCHOLOGY We start with two golden rules. Confidentiality and security. So you took the initiative and broke the both rules. It’s funny what measures you can, once you convince yourself. Let's see Miss Tilbe's performance. Tilbe, Tilbe the tenderhearted! Meeting number, OK. Signature target, met. Collection target, let's see? You should thank me! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have reached it once again. What was the name of that guy, the sweary guy? Mr. Feridun. With plate debt. Look, he paid his dues. You said, he was broke, he couldn’t pay. See? Once they are handed the notice, they all turn out to have secret savings. You don't push enough, guys. You have to push. Show real effort. Calling a few times on the phone, inviting them to a meeting, won’t do the trick. If I am the one to push the debtor, what's your use here? Ah, now I feel relieved. This one’s a dozer. You just ravished the target. And you were saying this job is not for you. I could tell from your eyes. Why did you miss your signature target, girl? Did you do it on purpose, just to keep away the evil eye? There was a last minute problem... with a file I thought that would definitely sign. If you're sure they won't pay, just send it to the court of bailiff's, don't bother anymore. No, I think she has money. I just need to push a little harder. OK, good, push them. Definitely push them. What can I do? You sometimes meet the target, sometimes you don't. It's a little bit luck. When you end up with a shitty file, what could you do? Exactly! Exactly! Push it, push it, push it! Asshole. Well, he's extra pushy nowadays. He's getting two new accounts. What? Nothing on earth can satisfy this guy. When he earns more, he invests more. Wouldn't you? What are you going to do with that file? I'll send another notice. You think a second notice will do the trick? It will if I send it to her home address. She's damn afraid of her mum. But you did not send the notice. I had no intention of sending it. I did it to try him. As expected, the news travelled fast. But we couldn't record it because he told her on the phone. Maybe he figured it out and acted warily? I don't think so. Because he told many other work-related things. Like what? Trivial stuff. Who does what, how the premiums are calculated... how we receive the personal information of the debtor from the bank... Let's just not mention the bank. I’m so sorry. Let's say the guy on the right is... owed 100 liras but has given up hope on that. We give that guy 20 liras and... we buy this debt. Now, everything is between the debtor and us. From that moment on, the bank does not care whether we collect... half of this debt or the full amount. Why doesn’t the bank collect the money itself but sells it to us? Good question. They cannot run after debtors like we do, and they cannot push them like us. Because they don't have enough workforce? That too but also they are afraid of being reported or sued. Guys, banks are huge institutions but they are also unreliable cowards. We have budget items spared for fines and compensations. In the last two years, we worked on thousands of files. Anyone want to guess how much compensation we ended up paying? Zero! Banks can't do that. Because we teach you... MANAGING DEBTOR PSYCHOLOGY this here. Let's go back to Miss Ceren. She and Mr Bahadir started seeing each other more often. And the times they didn’t see each other, they kept texting each other. So, everything went according to plan. At first, yes. What happened afterwards? Something must have happened. I don't know. The thing that always happens, I guess. -Should we park somewhere and come back. -No need. I’ll go and get them quickly. -What flavor would you like? -Doesn't matter. You can get me the same as you’re having. -I’ll be right back. -OK. Hi. Could I get two? -How much? -20 Liras. -Your phone rang. Thank you by the way. -Enjoy. -Who was it? -I don't know I didn't look. -My mum. I'll call her later. -OK. What's this, it's exploding! Yeah, it spilt everywhere. -I’m done, enough for me. -Well, me too. Could you do like... No, the other side... I'm sorry. This is my favorite spot in Istanbul. It's really beautiful... Isn’t it these “lokma” stores, popped everywhere all of a sudden. When one makes money, others follow I guess. We all have a tendency to hope. You think, everybody else is doint it, so why can’t we? You think it’s better to own a business rather than work 9 to 6. And then your boyfriend finds a really cheap place to rent. So you say to yourself this is my chance, and boom, you take a loan from the bank. Stupid girl, you don’t even question why the rent is so low? I still wonder how I managed... to find myself in a debt neck-deep from such a small store. Money down the drain. The worst part is, I lost my mother’s money along mine. The whole debt is on you? What about your boyfriend, is he not helping out? My ex-boyfriend... We opened an Escape Game place because it was so popular back then. He escaped, I couldn’t. -Well, what’s done is done. -Exactly. I'm not famous for making good decisions anyway. I can understand how you feel. It must feel like it won't ever go away. Four years ago one night, I came and parked here. I didn't have a penny in my pocket. I didn’t have anyone to call. I was determined, I would drive the car to the sea. I know it sounds crazy... but at that moment, I felt that it was the right thing to do. Why didn't you, then? Because it would pass. One year later I wouldn't be feeling like this. Or 4 years later, whatever... Did everything get all well? No. I'm still paying for my mistakes. But anyways... Right now, right here, I'm happy to be with you in this car. Maybe you don’t share the sentiment right now but believe me, things will get better. I promise you, the next time we come here, you'll be feeling way better. Hey. Do you trust me? Good. Shall we go now? Shall we go to my place? Regardless of the subject, there are always two types of people. Debtor-creditor, rich-poor, employer-employee. You cannot decide which one you’ll be. But you can decide whether you'll be a hunter or a hunt. If you act like a prey, you'll be hunted. If you don't want to be a prey, you need to learn to be a hunter. Bahadir, can you come up here? How long have you been working with us? More than 2 years. Can you please tell us how we met? As a debtor. Bahadir resisted being... a prey so much that... we decided to make him part of our team. We structured his remaining debt, now he works and pays it in installments. We caught him from his tail... and didn’t let him go. Now, I want a volunteer. Shall we? We’ll do a test run. Could you come up here? It's mine. -What time is it? -7 am. Mine will go off shortly. Why are you laughing? I’ve given you my university uniform. -I think it looks good on me. -Yeah you’re right, it does. You can keep it if you like. No, thanks. If you give away a T-shirt to every girl that comes here... Well, not many people come here. -Really? -Yep. How about from work? Haven’t you met anyone like me, before? No, it’s not really a good place to meet people. Doesn't it get your nerves to work in such an atmosphere? Well, of course it does. So, why do you work there? Because I need to. I have to hang on a little bit more. I guess I couldn’t have done it. Well, it won't be long before they fire me anyway. Why? I can't reach my quota for the last three quarters. If it happens for the fourth time... But It's not only you, right? What about Duygu? Duygu? She's so cunning, she'll always find a way to come first. She's gunning for me, she would get me fired... if she had a chance. This time it's yours. What I understand, you had too much self confidence. You tried to control the debtor's mind but you forgot about her heart. They don't teach heart control in the training. -Hi. -Hi. -I’m in a hurry, could we talk here? -OK. -Did you bring the USB? -Yes, it’s in my purse. Could you make him talk about Eray? He doesn't like the guy but doesn’t talk about him either. If only he would talk about him as well. Should I put a gun against his head to make him talk? He did tell me about some other stuff though. -Like what? Like you. How you’re the number one all the time. He knows that you're going after him. He's aware there’s something fishy. Do you have these on record as well? No. But I realized something else. Bahadir doesn’t want anything from me. He doesn’t mean any harm to me. He just helps me. On the other hand, you're always asking for something. You want me to sign stuff, pay stuff, record stuff. And I'm doing whatever you ask me to, like an idiot. Did you sleep with him? Whom I sleep with is none of your business. God, I can’t believe how stupid you are. Give me the USB! From now on, I'm not going to do as you say. And If you call me again, I'll tell Bahadir all about it. By the way, there is nothing in the USB. It's empty! Good. Ceren Köse's file is appointed to Duygu, there is zero collection. Then, God knows what happens, it's appointed to you and money starts to flow. Don't you ever ask how a debtor starts to pay all of a sudden? As long as money comes, nobody here cares about the how’s and the why’s. So you say, if I find some cash, even my debt can be totally written off? Sure. For instance, how much? For a debt of 200K to be written off, how much would you need? It depends on the the interviewer. If you have given up hope on the debt... and you can collect one-third of it in cash you can convince the boss that... it's the best amount we could get. OK, If I had 60.000 liras, and you were the one to interview me, would you write off my debt? -Nope. -Why? Of course I would. I’d also benefit from that. I would have reached my quota. But where would you find 60.000 liras? No bank would give you a loan. -My mum has jewelries. -What? My mum has jewelries. They should easily be worth 60-70K. Will she give you if you were to ask? She keeps them at home. She thinks I don’t know where they are, but I do. What, you're going to steal your mum’s jewelries? Don’t be silly. But I will replace them immediately. As soon as my record is clean, I will get a loan and replace them. Five years. At least for five years, you cannot get a loan from any bank. -What if I get the loan? -What? I’m just thinking out loud now. I'd have 8-10K of premium from the money you’d pay... I have a loan that I will pay the last installment of next month, I can take a new loan after that. We can replace them in two months. Would you do something like that? I mean... Bahadir, I promise I will pay you at least 2.5 each month. You can really trust me. I do already. But if we'll do this, we have to do it now. The premiums will be calculated next week. Thank you very much! Duygu, wasn't that your file? I guess it’s with Bahadir now. Your expenses are all on houseware. Are you moving? No. I'm getting married. Really? Congrats. Thanks. When? -Beginning of summer. -That's soon. Yes, before the wedding, there are many expenses. I have a payment schedule that would relieve you. The down payment is very affordable as well. I would like to think before signing. But if you come back later, you'll have much more trouble with fines and interests. I see, but if I sign... without checking with my fiancée first, that could cause a problem. -Sounds like a short-tempered guy? -Just a little. And he really doesn’t like credit cards, debts, etc. Well, as you wish. I can't push you. But Miss Tilbe, wouldn't it be more problematic like this? What do you mean? If you had signed, you'd clear some of the debt with the gifts that would come with the wedding. It would be much bitter if you'd have notices, bailiffs and all that before the wedding. Will the court of bailiff's get involved that quickly? I can’t guarantee anything about that. If you trust and support each other no matter what... of course you'd get over the bailiff too. But if you don't have such trust... We see many marriages end in situations like this. I'm not saying that yours is that kind of relationship... Don’t get me wrong... For a second I thought I really had a debt. When Mr Bahadir said that marriages end, that knocked me off. I hope you all watched carefully. You don't have to have a plan. Just listen to the debtor. The debtor will tell you where to work on. We’ll have a lunch break now. Sister, something bad happened. Call me. In the afternoon, everybody... will have their first interviews Go ahead please. What was the next time you saw Miss Ceren? When she came for interview. Didn't you call and try to convince her? No. There is a point where you give up. I gave up. You can’t help someone who won’t help themselves. She wouldn't believe anything I'd say... before seeing it for herself. Where's Tilbe? She has a doctor's appointment. She'll be back in the afternoon. This is a new trend. Pregnant people keep getting the babies checked. Cool. Polat, did we send notices for my files? Which file? There is only one, for Ceren Köse, we sent it yesterday. Exactly. OK bro, thanks. I will send notices for today’s files on Monday. Monday, OK. -Hello, Ceren. -I told you not to call me. I haven’t called to chat, honey. The reason I’ve called... I should warn you, let me. I'm hanging up. One second! Your name is on the list, bailiff list. What bailiff? We cleared the debt. Did you receive a signed paper stating you don't have debt? What? Did you or did you not take a signed paper? It's not possible. Can't happen. Call the company and ask for a receipt. Don't call me again. I thought, I wouldn’t feel sorry for her. But it breaks your heart to see... someone’s world shattering down. Phone for you? Tell her I’m not available, I’m in a meeting. She keeps calling on and on. OK, thanks. Hello. What are you trying to do? Why do you keep calling? I see, but I’m not available, I can’t pick up. Could you please calm down. I’ll tell you everything tonight. I told you that we would talk outside. Why do you come all the way here? Are you kidding, Bahadir? They sent a bailiff order to my apartment. I'm asking you what is going on, but you don't get back to me. -OK, just be calm, we’ll talk. -How can I be calm, Bahadir? I'm going crazy. You don't answer my calls. Let’s just get in the car first. -I’m not getting in the car! -Ceren, please! Those notices go to my mum’s. She'll have a heart attack if she finds out. You can pay just 5-10K and delay the bailiff. What do you mean? How can I pay 5-10K? Where will I find that? Didn't you tell me you'll take a loan? I cashed in all my mother's jewelries. Just because you said you're gonna take loan. Won't you? Please get in. Ceren could you please get in the car. I’ll tell you everything. Ceren, please! Don’t start the car! We’re not going anywhere until you tell me everything! They don't even give me credit cards. My situation is worse than you. You’re kidding, right? Are you joking? You said you would... I cashed in my mother's jewelries... Then why did you say that? I've trusted you. Is that why you recorded our conversations? What? You thought I didn't realize that? I invented all these tricks. This is how many days after your call? 2-3 days later I guess. Here you show up. I thought I should intervene because they were arguing loudly. She becomes angrier after you show up. Why did she flare all of a sudden? She asked for my help. What did you say? I said you sleep in the bed you make. God damn you! God damn you! You have no right to play with one’s dignity! What's the difference between you and swindlers? How can you spend that premium! Hope you choke on it! Why are you yelling, miss? What do you mean? You tricked me. You took everything from me... Don't you have a debt? Did we usurp the money? Aren't you human? Aren’t you human beings? -Ceren, calm down. -Don’t! How dare you tell me to calm down? Please show her way out. God damn you all! -God damn you all! Shut up! -Are you OK? Send her to bailiff's immediately. Don't strive. As if she asked me before spending it. Duygu! Duygu! Tilbe? It was by far the worst day of my life. We’re used to debtors getting mad at us... but if something bad had happened to Tilbe or her baby, I would never have forgiven myself! -I think my water just broke. -OK, OK, someone call an ambulance! -Call Firat. Tell him to come! -OK, Polat is calling him right away. Calm down OK. Don’t be scared... Duygu, I can’t have the baby now, it’s too early! Too early! I know, I know... You know eventually shit will hit the fan. No matter how... prepared you are, you still get messed up. You are a human at the end... it’s gets you in the end. But there are two types of people, right? Debtors and creditors. Everyone is responsible for oneself, for the games you play, for the decisions you make. If you are hunting, you should act like a hunter. I only did my job. -Duygu. -Darling... Where is Aunt Nezihe? She’s out to get some tea. Come sit. -Shall I? -Sure sure. Are you well? I have some pain, but I’m much better now. -Did you see her? -Yes, I did. She is small, right? Very small but so cute. Nurse told me she'll bring her to you in a couple of hours. I hope so. When the pains started early, I thought it was debtors' curse. She was born safe and sound, don't worry about debtors. Don't think about work until you come back. I'm not coming back. That’s not a good place. I made up my mind. Of course, you’ll do as you decide darling. I'll work with Firat until Gül grows up. Then, I'll try to find a new job. Maybe by then we'd make so much money. We'd open that breakfast place in Kuzguncuk, the one you dream of... We open it in the morning and close it at noon. Sure why not... Gül would be there with us. We would let her wonder around in the shop... We would make everything ourselves. I could do many types of jams. I would set up the olives. We would buy the best honey, best cheese... We could make it work... If only we had some money... We would darling... I need to go now, I'll visit you again. OK. Thank you Duygu. -See you. -See you. If you're doing this job, you always think about this possibility. I couldn’t overcome you in this life, but I'm not... gonna leave you in peace in the hereafter. The same text she sent to Bahadir. I wasn't surprised when I saw the message. Seeing the way she stormed out of the office. I called. She didn't respond. I texted. Then I checked her address from her file. You’re not answering my calls. Let's talk, we'll find a solution. -Open, please? -I’m coming. Yes? -Does Miss Ceren live here? -Yes? What if I didn't go? What if I was one hour late? Or what if I hadn’t checked my phone? She might have died. But she didn't. You saved her life in a way. What about the others before her? We have no idea whose life we’ve destroyed... who committed suicide, who survived... we have no idea. OK. We'll take it from here. But you'll do as I say. You'll leave the company immediately. You'll even get your compensation. But... you need to sign here. What is this? Nondisclosure agreement. -Is that all? -Yeah, that's all. You can’t ever contact Ceren again. You'll never talk to anyone about this issue and never work in this sector. This wasn’t a job for me anyway. I’m not so sure about that. It seems like you did everything you were supposed to do. I had to. Now we are giving a lunch break. In the afternoon, everyone will do their first phone interview. Tell me what happened. Sister, something came with the mail. I signed and received, it turned out to be a notice. Sezgi, please talk without crying. Who sent the notice? The landlord. Why did you sign a document without knowing what it is. How should I know, they first made me sign it, and then gave it. Sister, nothing will happen, right? No, don’t worry. Don't tell mum I've signed, OK? OK. I can't talk right now, I'll call you. Take a photo of it and send me. Don’t cry. It will be all right. -Who's the debtor? -Doesn't matter, you start. You're the debtor then. -Hi. -Hi. I'm calling from Eray Ege Consultancy. About your prosecuted debt... I'm busy right now, call me later. Mr. Polat. Excuse me, I just called to give you a brief info. It will be for your benefit. I'm listening. We reduce the default interest if you can pay 5000 TL or above... before the end of the month. I'm letting you know just so you don't miss this opportunity. I can’t find that amount until the end of the month. He only opposed to the amount. He didn't say that he can’t pay. OK, OK. How much can you pay, maybe we can show some flexibility. I'm not going to pay bro. I don't have a penny. What do you want, my life? EVACUATION NOTICE Aggressive behavior. Just say: I'm just informing you not to have trouble. On the next page... Should I say: ‘sorry I need the check the next page’ to the guy on the phone? This is nonsense, guys. Did that guy inside have papers at hand? Rules are obvious. Fool the debtor... and if you can't, intimidate them, that's all. What’s up? I can’t do it. Have a good day. You could at least try. No, this job is not for me. Good luck. Why do you insist, bro? Less people, more job guarantee. I don't know, he came all the way here, so he could at least give it a try. He might have felt self-reproach. Calling debtors and all that... Don't we have conscience? They always call me when I don't pay the required minimum. I'll call them too, that's the job. I don't care about the rest. Wouldn’t you? We'll call, let's see. You? I will call, I guess. -I have no other option. -That’s it. Let’s start from the beginning. -Come on. -You be the debtor now... OK. You're aware how cheap you got off? If something have happened to that girl, you'd be spending years in the prison. Is that all? That’s all. Duygu? She signed as well. There really are two types of people. But you never know who is who. Good luck with your first file. Feridun Karakale. A large account. He owes 320K. He paid his child's school tuition every month. Then nothing else. So he receives some money at the beginning of each month. If you can push today, you can have some. If you wait until next week the money will either go to the school... or to another creditor... They all panic when they see an unknown number calling. If you can push him at that moment, they won't have a place to run. If you stumble, you have the text to follow. I guess I got too excited. Can I try later? OK, you can try after the break. Thank you. Who's next? I’m calling for your credit debt. No. I’m calling to help you regarding your credit card debt. Nothing to memorize here. It's for people who don’t know where to start. But that's not your problem as far as I understand. Let me guess. You identified yourself with the person you're going to call, right? How he feels, what he would do, he must have children and all. Because his story hit close to home. I told you in the morning, there are two types of people. When you ask, no one chooses to be a prey. But you are... choosing it right now. Either you go up the stage and call your file... or sooner or later one of those guys will call you. The decision is yours. Miss Gamze, hello. I'm Duygu. I've called you to help about your credit debt to Kapital Bank. We can discuss and schedule your payment plan together. Just got out. Done. Just as I expected. Welcome. -Hello. -Welcome. -Please have a seat. -Thanks. Yes. Things has happened beyond our control, things that we never approve of. We started our internal investigation. Two employees were discharged immediately. I personally will be following the matter. The bank is not directly related... but our institution will be with you to the end, please rest assured. Thanks to Mr. Eray, he showed flexibility. Your remaining debt, will be written off. I think there is a misunderstanding. We’re here because you said you have an offer. This is our offer. We cleared the debt and we apologized. You apologized and...? Let us hear your demands, Miss Belkis. If it is reasonable, maybe we can discuss it? We have prepared something. A very reasonable proposal. No way. You’re demanding for the... whole fine and compensation budget of the last two years? Yes. In my client's file, there is every breach that could cause fines and compensation. OK but why the last two years? We found out that you paid zero compensation for the last two years. Your employees have told everything about how you work. It's not possible. OK, let's go to the court, let's see how much you'll get. Of course we're going to the court but I think you didn’t get it yet. Our intention is to take this beyond the court. In this, there are 19 voice records... belonging to Duygu Tüzel and Bahadir Ertan. We believe this is a public conscience matter. But we are still not sure if should add the bank's name in the hashtags we use. Miss Belkis, the bank is not officially a counterparty in this debt. One second. Ceren: How do you know my mother has money? Bahadir: Not only your mother, we can... get your whole family's info from the bank. It's actually illegal... but Eray runs the system by saying, if there will be a problem... I'll take full responsibility. Bank willingly, turns a blind eye. It goes on like this for pages. A guy tries to get a debtor girl in bed, and lies to do so. Is this what you call evidence? Detailed address, debt, family tree information about 141 people. Your institution, Miss Müge, exploited... Privacy Act of your customers. One second... Do you threaten us? -This is downright opportunism... -Mister Eray! We get you fully. You came well-prepared. If you’ll allow us, let us discuss this between us. Please keep comfortable. Mister Eray, let's talk outside. Miss Müge, this woman knows she can't get 2K if she goes to the court... and asks for 2 million liras. That's right... but we need to solve this issue. It could cause great discomfort to the bank. That's opportunism. The bank should see it as it is. But the bank won't see it that way. -They would see it as risk. -What risk? Loss of clients, loss of prestige. Crisis management, ad campaigns for brand image and etc, things get big. So, what're we doing? This money will be paid. -Who'll pay it? -You will, Mr. Eray. No way. It’s better if I shut down the company then. Listen to me. There are at least fifty infringements on the documents they have. If this gets public, bank will crush you like a bug. Let alone bidding for debts, you won't be able to open this company's door. So, here's what we're going to do: We go in, you apologize again... and sign the paper without causing any scene. One moment, please. Now we can continue. Here you go. Thank you. We thank you. Have a good day. Duygu, what else is there? Let me see, honey. 3 breakfast sets. 1 sausage, 1 cheese toast but both with sauce. -With? -Yes, with. -And two pancakes for number 4. -OK. And Muzo please serve the tea, people are about get crazy. Well, he has only two hands. Table 2 asks for the check, Sister Duygu. OK. Bring the tea and don't spare the horses! -We're waiting for the tea? -Coming up! -Excuse me, could I get the check? -Card or cash? Cash. Cards create problems. I live closeby. Saw this place and thought I would drop by. That’s great. -Could I have some milk as well? -Sure, right away. This is a cute place. It is, yes. We’re also happy with it. I’ve always wanted to open a cafe or a restaurant as well. So, how's work? Fine. I left the bank. I work freelance now. It's more comfortable. I’m happy for you to be honest. Me too. You know about the firm? I’ve heard. Mr Eray shut it down. He had two tenders, relying on the money coming from the bank. Thanks. When the bank annulled his contract and... money flow stopped, he was down. It's not easy for him to recover again. I’m sorry to hear that. Well, I'm not. Still chasing your case but I don't think anybody will work with him again. What do you mean by chasing? He saw Bahadir and Ceren. Together. Holding hands. Stop, stop it here! Bro, bro! The cab fare. Eray thinks they tricked everyone. The bank, himself, me... You... You know what “I” think? I don’t believe those two could manage to conduct a plan like this. You say someone helped them? Yes, an insider. Someone who knows everything, someone who had enough. I have a theory if you care to listen... Why did you say that? I've trusted you. Is that why you recorded our conversations? What? You thought I didn't realize that? I invented all these tricks. Then why did you act like nothing happened? Because I promised you something, and I'll keep my word. But please, let’s just get out of here, I’ll tell you all about it. Ceren, please. Why did we come here? Duygu? Bahadir, what’s going on? Let’s go... You're insane. You're inhuman. You’re not normal. No way! She won’t get it! There is a way out for all of us. If you listen to what we have to say... Since when have you been planning this? From the very beginning, right? I'm gonna report you. For once in your life, use your brains. I'll get you fired, both of you. Sure, do that. What will you gain for getting us fired? Will they write off your debt? Your mum will realize her jewelries... are gone when she sees the bailiff at your door. You've trapped me. You've cornered me. Good morning! That's our job, honey. We are paid to rob people of... the last bits of money they are about to buy bread. They make us eat each other like dogs... for a few hundred liras worth of bonuses. The voice records you have. They are gold to disclose the dark secrets of this firm. There is an amount spared for compensations. A huge amount. And we can take it. It's so simple what you have to do. Really very simple. What kind of shit is this? OK, I get it, look. You take my money to write off the debt... and now you tell me that it’ll go to the bailiff. There’s nothing else I can do. I couldn’t convince the management. This is all I can do. You need to make more noise. What should I do? Throw something to the floor. God damn you! God damn you! You have no right to play with one’s dignity! If everything happens in front of everyone... they won't be able to survive it. Survive what? What do you want me to do? Where are you? At home. Mum just went out. Good. Is the housekeeper in the building? Yes, he’s cleaning the stairs. It will take a couple of hours. OK, I'll be there twenty minutes after you send me the text. I can't do it I guess. What if you are late? I won't, don’t worry. You won’t take all the pills anyways. No one’s gonna count them when they’re out of your stomach. Just take 5-6 of them and throw the rest to the toilet. You'll sleep till morning in the worst case. -OK. -One second. Before sending the text, erase all the other texts. OK. There are two kinds of people Ceren. Those who wait for the fairy godmother... and those who take control of their own destiny. The choice is yours! You play with me like a cat plays with mouse. How can I trust you? How can we trust you? They will give the money to you. Not to us. No more games. Even if there is, you are the only cat now. Not us. Duygu's right. You’re holding all the cards. I don't want to be a mouse from now on. I don't think you want it, either. Don't get me wrong. I'm not asking you whether it happened like this. After all, I might be recording this. Of course not. I'm just taking a guess. Maybe I have missed some details but I'm sure it all went more or less like this. If you wanted to get Bahadir fired, the first record would be more than enough. But that’s not what you were after. You found the right debtor and moved ahead with your plan. I guess the rest of it was not that hard. Don't you think it should have ended by now? Nothing to do. We'll wait. At least reply, girl! I see that you’re reading them. If it was you, would you come? She's here. -How did it go? -Good. We got even with Kapital Mother. Didn’t I tell you, the next time we'd be here, everything would be much better? Miss Müge, I really don’t understand what you’re talking about... Don't worry, nobody can prove anything at this stage anymore. Even if they do, nothing will happen. It’s over... Fresh Start. I think everyone deserves a brand new beginning. It really is a nice place. Wish you have many customers. Thank you. Do you know what I’m dying to learn about? How can one imagine such a thing? How do you plan this? How do you convince people? Right. I wouldn't say it either if I were you. I'll pay for coffee. No, there's no need to. That's on us. OK, thank you. No, I should thank you. TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE Mr Deniz, I'm calling from Eray Ege Consultancy. You have signed a liability to pay, it will have harsh consequences. I understand auntie. When is the hearing? God willing auntie, god willing. I will call you later then. Have a good day. Shall we get going, Tilbe? We’ll check out an apartment with Firat. He found one. I would invite you as well but it might take long. -Would you want to? -No, you go. I'll take the ferry. Where are you going? I can drop you off. No, I’ll take the ferry. Thanks. No worries. I can drop you off, it's on my way. OK then. Shall we go? -Say hi to Firat. -OK. -Good evening. -Good evening. It’s hard for everyone in the beginning. You’ll get used to it in a month or two. I don’t think I can get used to this. Every night I cry myself to sleep and wake up crying. Don’t exaggerate. I’m not. That woman has three kids, Bahadir! She's embezzling to pay the debts. What’s gonna happen to those kids, if she is arrested? You didn't push her into embezzling. I did. Don't we all? We are pushing them all. Could be worse. She'll end up in prison, what's worse? Some debtor from Murat's company. He committed suicide. What? See? They are in a stew. He jumped from the top of the plaza. They are paying a big settlement to the family not to sue them. If you want your voice to be heard, you need to die obviously. Whole company works day and night for two weeks now, bank is auditing all the files one by one. It can happen to us any minute. One bad interview will do. God forbid. We have enough to worry. The suicide would be the cherry on the top. Maybe someone should really commit suicide after all. LEAVE THE REST TO YOUR BANK
