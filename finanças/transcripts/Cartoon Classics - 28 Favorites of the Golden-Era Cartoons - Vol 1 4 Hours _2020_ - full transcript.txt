("The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down") (dramatic music) - [Male] Up in the sky! Look! - [Female] It's a bird! - [Male] It's a plane! It's Superman! ("Superman Theme") (gentle music) - [Narrator] In the endless reaches of the universe, there once existed a planet known as Krypton, a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens. Their civilization was far advanced and had brought forth a race of super men whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection. But, there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son on a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth, just as Krypton exploded. (explosion) The rocket ship sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden, Krypton's sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. The infant of Krypton is now the man of steel. Superman! To best be in a position to use his amazing powers in the never ending battle for true justice, Superman has assumed disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper. (playful music) - [White] Kent, I want to see you. Just received another threatening note. - [Kent] Okay, Mr. White. - [White] Lois, another note from the mad scientist. - [Lois] Coming in, Chief. - Listen to this warning. He plans to strike tonight. Beware, you fools. My electrothanasia-ray strikes tonight at 12. Total destruction will come to those who laughed at me and failed to heed my warnings. Beware, I strike at midnight. This nut may prove dangerous. Kent, you help Lois follow up her lead. She may have an angle on this thing. - Yes, sir. - But Chief, I'd like the chance to crack the story on my own. - Well, now- - Thanks, Chief. - But, Lois. Chief, don't you think that's a dangerous mission? (dramatic music) (clock chiming) - The hour has come. (dramatic music) (plane engine) (dramatic music) (knocking) - I'm a reporter for the... Oh! - So, you want the story. I'll give you the greatest story of destruction the world has ever known. (machine whirring) How is that for a story, Ms. Lane? (evil laughter) - [Male] True to his threat, the mad scientist, whose warnings have held the city in a grip of terror, went on his rampage of destruction on the stroke of midnight. The deadly impact of his mysterious reign smashed the famous Tower Bridge, hurling cars and pedestrians into the river below. The police have warned everyone to remain in their homes. - This looks like a job for Superman. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (machine whirring) (upbeat music continues) - It's Superman! I don't believe it! He isn't human! (explosion) (dramatic music) (explosion) - Congratulations, Lois. That was a great scoop. - Yes, Chief. Thanks to Superman.

Well, I wish I was out of here. Can you show me the entrance to the exit? - Oh, certainly. - Well, let's get out of here. - You said it. - Hey, take it easy. Quit your shoving.

Penetrating deep into the waste of the great arctic plains, an archeological expedition searching for prehistoric fossils makes an amazing discovery. A huge monster. As lifelike in appearance as when it roamed the Earth years ago in the Mesozoic age is found frozen in the ice in a state of perfect preservation. Constantly handicapped by the hazardous subzero elements, the scientists and their band of tireless workers succeed in removing the mammoth creature from the frozen depths. The ice encased monster is loaded into the hold of a huge crater, equipped with a special refrigeration plan and brought to this country. Here, in a specially constructed wing of the Museum of Natural Science, this awe inspiring creature is displayed to the public for the first time. (uptempo string music) - Do you mean to say that if the ice were permitted to thaw, there's a possibility the monster might still be alive? Thank you, professor. - [Lois] Yes, Chief? - [White] Lois, there's a new angle on that frozen monster story. Get over to the museum and see what's doing. They've got him in a special refrigerator. - [Lois] Okay, Chief. - Oh, Lois. Want me to go over there with you? - No, thanks. You'd probably faint if you saw the monster. You scare so easily. - Maybe she's right, but Superman hasn't fainted yet. - And produces the necessary refrigeration. The control board is downstairs. I'll show you.

Here we find the farmer's faithful old watchdog. Though he is no longer very active, he still does a few little odd jobs around the house. One of his chores is to fetch the newspaper. (whistling) Oh, there's the paper now. (barking) (chuckling) - I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy. - [Narrator] Here is a group of cute little piggies, playing in the... Well, what are they up to? They seem fascinated by that clock. Oh, well. Here's a proud mother hen, carefully watching over her eggs, anxiously awaiting the eventful day. What a happy little family this will be. What's this? A weasel. The ruthless thief of the barnyard, watching his chance to sneak in and steal those defenseless little eggs. He draws closer, and closer, and closer. (tense music) - [All] Boo! - Don't ever do that! (panting) (chicks laughing) - [Narrator] In the nearby trees, we find many species of bird life. (birds twittering) The birds always... Oh, look up there. No, no, over to the left. See? A little owl, nestling inside the tree trunk. (hooting) Here's an interesting sight. A young couple laboriously building their nest with a bit of string from here and a piece of straw from there. A little twig. A bit of string. A piece of straw, a little twig, a bit of string, a piece of straw, a little twig, a bit of string, a piece of straw, little twig, string, string, straw, string... âª There's no place like home âª - [Narrator] At the edge of the woods, field mice make their home. Here we see one of the most common types. Say, he seems to be a bit worried. Tell me, little fellow, what seems to be troubling you? - I don't know, doc. I just keep hearing things. - [Narrator] Even the tiniest of insects, such as the ants, have a language all their own. (ants chattering) Emerging from the opening comes a female of the species. If you listen very closely, you can hear her calling to her young. - Harry! - Coming, Mother. - [Narrator] The modern farm is conducted on a business like... Well, here are those little piggies again. Say, piggies, why don't you go off and play? - [All] Mmm-mmm. - [Narrator] Oh, well, suit yourself. Here is one of the strangest friendships that has ever been known. Natural enemies, yet living together as friends, a cat and a mouse. Tell me, is it true that the cat takes good care of you? (squeaks) And keeps you nice and warm? (squeaks) Well, that's truly a friendship. Now, before we leave you, is there anything that you would like to say to your friends in the audience? (squeaks) - Get me out of here! - [Narrator] And so, as the day draws to a close and the sun sinks slowly in the west, we reluctantly take our leave of the farm. Well, the piggies again.
