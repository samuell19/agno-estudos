There. We're going for a nice swim. - Right, Philip? - Yes. There you go. Getting an eyeful? Not really. - Did you manage? - Pissed all over the can. - She's so fucking hot. - Who? Where? Fuck. She looks a bit like that chick I balled in Salou. - Camille, or something. - Tell us again about Salou. The chicks over there are wild. Doesn't matter who or what you are, they just bang you. - You still jerk off thinking of them. - Oh, come on, you filthy virgin. - That's what your dad said last night. - To your mom. That makes no sense. What? - She's tucking her hair behind her ears. - Does she have big boobs? - Your size. - Don't. - It's all muscle tissue. - Stop it. Joost's boob is the only one we ever touch. That's not funny, it's fucking pathetic. Here, man, that could have been us. But it's not, we're fucking disabled. Let's go for a drink in the aqua bar. Hey, maybe there are some hot chicks there. Guys, who knows a song? Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer - Let's go to Salou. - Us? To Salou? - Yes, us to Salou. Are you deaf as well? - No. What will we do there? What do you think? Balling those wild women Lars always talks about. Right. And you'll ask our parents to take us to Spain - to give our dicks some action? - No. Just the three of us. Oh, interesting. Lars, will you pull up my underpants? Then I'll wipe Philip's ass. So what? Should I walk around with an erect virgin willy the rest of my life? Hello. Speak for yourself, okay? How many Camilles have you banged since you ended up in that wheelchair? Take one down, pass it around now I have 98 bottles of beer on the wall - I'm done. - Can I have Lars' dessert? Who says he doesn't want dessert? He didn't finish his plate so he can't have dessert. That rule doesn't apply to him, Jasmijn. - Come and help me with the dishes. - But it's not fair. - I'll help you. - You don't have to help. Jasmijn? - What's the job you worked on today? - A new site for the library. Okay, okay. - Sounds nice. - It's boring. I cant make any decisions. Sweetie, come on. Try to think positively, because this is a great opportunity. Right? I'll add a piece of sausage. She's crying. And now he's leaving the room. I'd be so upset if you left me behind here on my own. So awful. - Shall I get us a snack? - No, you sit. I'll do it. There. - Good night, son. - Yeah. - Do you want... - No, don't feel like it. There. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night. NEW MESSAGE PHOTOS SOCCER WEEKEND Sweetheart... - Sweetheart. - Yeah. Lars is here. Let's go to Spain. - Yes. - Yes, very good. Hola, supermercado, telebancos por aqui - Don't stay too long. Philip's working. - Yeah. Joost. How are you? Vamos a Espanja? Well... I've been thinking about it, but it's a bad idea. - Why, Joost? - Yes, why? Who washed and dressed you this morning? - And how did you get here? - That's a good point. But yo habos thought about it. We'll bring along a carer with a van. - Good plan. - And where will you get such a person? "Tailored to your needs." "For a few hours a week, or 24/7 care." "Has adapted van." Great. Is he licensed? - It doesn't say. - So that's useless. Okay, here: "Licensed and experienced homecare." - Like that better? - That's homecare. So? He can do it on the road. And we'll all pack into his car? "Professional, reliable disabled care. Licensed and owns adapted passenger van. Full-time available for both caring and nursing at home or on the road." - Great. - I'm not so sure. Know what, Joost? If you don't like the idea, just stay home. Lars and I will go and buy you a T-shirt. - Is that nurse a guy? - Yeah, his name is Lub. His name is Lub. How appropriate. With a Lubricator to the Costa. Where would you like to go? - To Spain. - Your timing is off. - With that takeover in Switzerland. - You don't understand. - We want to go with the three of us. - What do you mean? - The three of us in a van. - Van? - For how long? - A week. - About ten days. - Ten days. - Joost, your mom agrees to this? - Well... She thinks it's good for my development. She just doesn't want me to drive. We don't want to go completely by ourselves. - We're going with a carer. - Carer? Geez, do you have to repeat everything? You know, a guy who pulls on your clean underpants and hoists you into bed. Take it easy. We found someone who fits the bill. I kind of like the idea. Can I have a look? Oh, no, from eBay? Have you lost your minds, guys? Okay, a carer from eBay is probably not a good idea. But what if we look for someone? Someone we know and trust. That guy from swimming. He owns a van. - What's his name again? - Ton. We could go and talk to him, just to see what he thinks about it. Folks, this is a hydraulic ramp. So that's great. Inside we have the safest fastening system available on the European market. This is fastened and unfastened again, so that's great. We have a GPS system that allows you to track your sons up to a meter. - That's wonderful. - I like that. Lars, press that button. - So we have a built-in DVD player. - Awesome. There's a fridge with good stuff in it. We have cupboards with colouring pencils. And what's great too... If I may... We have an intercom system. - So, folks, we have an intercom system. - Great sound. - It is wonderful. - What do the parents think? These guys want to go on an adventure. We should let them have that. With this wonderful van, we can only agree. Yo, goodbye and farewellos, wave at your sonnos. - That one's cool. It has a swimming pool. - Yes. It's too expensive, sis. Why does it have to be Salou? For the same reason I won't allow you to go there in a few years. Why don't you go and help Mom with the dishes. No. That's mean. Lars, that's not funny. Mom? Mom. - Hi, Lars, how are you? - Fine. Hello. I'm going on a trip. Lars, I'm afraid I have bad news. On the scan we can see there's a new, large metastasis. It's dangerously close to one of the arteries in your brain. That's not possible. You mistook someone else's scan for mine. I'm so sorry, Lars. Look, I'm doing just fine. Look. I'm doing just fine. You really need the wheelchair, Lars. To be honest, I'm afraid we have to adjust your life expectancy considerably. Lars, I think this is dreadful. And although I find it regrettable, your mom is right. The trip is off. Philip, do you still have the email address of that guy on eBay? Of the Lubricator? Why? To send him an email that he has to come with us. But Lars... you're going... I'm going to Spain. To bang a hot chick. - What about your parents? - Fuck my parents. - Lars, are you sure? - As sure as my balls are blue. - Come here. - I'm going to email him. Mom. Yes. - Hello. Good going. - Sorry. Sorry, my ass. If you'd rather watch TV, just say so. - Shall I put you in bed? - No, just go and watch TV. But you can't sleep in your chair, sweetheart. - Sweetheart? - Leave me alone. Okay, good night. Good night. Mom? I'm here, honey. - How did I deserve this? - Because. SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT I DIDN'T MEAN IT DEAR MOM, I WENT ON A TRIP HAVE TO DO THIS, DON'T WORRY Jasmijn? Jasmijn? I'm going to Salou. - With my bag? - To think of you on the road. But I don't want you to die. I'm not going to die. - But Mom says you're ill and... - How many times? Don't listen to Mom. Don't tell Mom and Dad I've gone on a trip, OK? I'll see you soon. Yo, Larsie. - I see you're going to chase men. - Ha, ha. And you'll spend ten days in the same clothes? - Or naked? - Crap. Loser. We'll buy something. Thank you. - Sorry. - Hey, Joost. - Look at you. - I'm here. - I made it on my own. - Well, made... This is it. The Lubricator can't get here soon enough. I want to get out of here. Is that Lub? I don't hope so. Lars, what the fuck is this? Mom will come back soon. Bye, sweetie. - Philip? - Fuck me. - I'm Lub. - Looks more like a 'flub'. Damn. - We can't go on a spree with a woman. - A woman? - Then the high voice make sense. - Want to cancel the whole thing? - How could you not have noticed? - By email? Crap. - Is she hot? - Joost, please. - Philip, is she hot? - Joost. - Nice to meet you. I'm Joost. - I'm Lub. Were you speaking an Eastern-European language just now? - Where are you from? - Croatia. Where's the advance? It's not quite the professional van your ad promised. Let's first see how far we get with this thing. Okay. No advance, no trip. Lars... Give her 150. Gosh, I wonder where the built-in DVD player is. Mom's calling. Mom's calling... Don't answer it, no? - Crap. Throw it out. - It's an iPhone. So keep it if you want to be traced by GPS before we've even started. - Throw them out, Lars. - Out. Goodbye and farewellos and wave at your sonnos. Amigos, we did it. If she has to top up the coolant every 50 kilometres, it's gonna take a while. - She's something. - Does she look nice? - Joost, be happy you're blind. - She does have a nice voice. But you can't put your dick in someone's voice. Fuck, I have to take a leak. - Ask the Lubricator to help you. - No way. I'd rather not pee for ten days. - Really? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yes. Done. Done. Does it say where you want to spend the night? - We want to keep going. - I'll need to sleep. A fucking makeover, that's what you need. Well... tasteful. At least we travelled a big stretch. - My day's wages. - I'll pay for your room. I just want my day's wages and today's kilometres. 255. Swindler. I guess you don't need help with your luggage? - Good day. - Good evening. - Help me out, Philip. - Good evening, we want a room. - Is that possible? - Yes, of course. All in one room? - Do we want to share a room? - With her? Sure. Lets not act disabled. Tell her we want three rooms. Three rooms, please. - Where's the Lubricator? - Hopefully in hell. - Isn't she staying in the hotel? - Who cares? Want to sleep next to her? I had my own room and an awesome mini-bar. - I'll take you up to bed. - No way, Jose. We got it. Lub... Good night. Good night, Joost. - Joost. - Yes? Can you take some stuff to Philip? I'll be right there, okay? Are you alright? Yeah, fine. - Seriously? Do I have to? - It's clean. - I'll put you in bed. - Let's wait for Lars. I can do it. Need to pee first, or would you rather pee in your pants? One, two... - Joost. - Lars? Help. - Ouch. Jerk. - Sorry. I'll be right back. Don't forget my key card. You locked me in, idiot. Joost, hurry. - I'm going to get Lub. - No. One, two, three. Sorry, sorry. - Joost, get me off. Joost. - Pardon me. Joost, get me off. Get me out of here. This is bad. I look like an idiot in your clothes, Joost. Be happy you're wearing something, seeing as you didn't bring anything. And why is that? I had to arrange this fucking trip. You didn't do anything. I can't help it my mom is a fucking Stasi. That your mom let's herself be screwed by the Stasi. Shut the fuck up, man. I've got a blinding headache. Whoa, with coloured inks. Mail it to me and I'll frame it. - Good morning. Slept well? - Not really. We booked three... Let's just hit the road. I have to go. I love you, you know. Bye, sweetheart. Come on. - Lars first. - Why? Safety. Safety? Good one. Look at this piece of junk of yours. Well, what are you waiting for? Man, what is that racket? Switch it off. What's going on? Jesus. We're going home in a tow truck, I'm afraid. No way, in my wheelchair, if I have to. Maybe that guy can have a look under her hood too. It needs some oil as well. - Do any of you speak German? - Yeah, Heil Hitler. - What's the problem? - We were driving and everything was fine but then suddenly... Why am I speaking German? Germany isn't on the route to Spain. - But we're in Austria. - Austria isn't on the route at all. Lub... We're not really heading for Spain anymore. So where are we heading exactly? - Kroatsco. - What? Croatia. What's the problem? Joost. Joost. Joost, please... Help. Joost. - Help me. - I'm coming. I'm here. I'm here. - I'm here. Come on. - Lub. Easy. Just don't get the idea we're paying you for all these wasted hours. I'm afraid we have more wasted hours coming up. Joost, you need a shower. Come on. I'm so sorry, Joost. My intentions aren't creepy. They aren't. - I thought... - I'll kidnap these guys. No, that's it not it. It really isn't. I wanted to teach you guys a lesson. Especially Philip. My daughter lives with my mother in Split. I haven't seen her for a year. - With Philip's big mouth, I thought... - Oh, Philip... He's just a blunt jerk on wheels. He hasn't accepted himself yet. You can see that, can't you? I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. It's awful. It's stupid of me. I know. Why the hell is it taking so long? She's probably giving him a blow job with that sour face of hers. Shut the hell up for once. Guys, Lub has to tell you something. - Croatia? - I'm sorry. I know it's ridiculous, but I thought... You thought you'd steal from three disabled guys - and then ditch them in the Eastern Bloc. - No, that's not... Fuck this shit. - Philip... - Shut up, psycho bitch. Let me out. Let me out. - Philip, where are you going? - What do you think? To Spain. How the fuck are you going to do it? - Philip? - Lars? - Over here. - Guys, I know this is fucked up. - But Lub isn't a psycho bitch. - Of course not. She feels hurt, by us. I know I sound like Philip's mom but let's see how we can look at it positively. Listen, I wanted us to have a great trip, but you didn't give me a chance. Lub's trying to say she was sick and tired of us. Listen, Lub, I'm paying you a shitload of cash to drive us. - You have no right to be sick and tired. - You have no right to insult me. Not because you pay me, not because you're in a wheelchair. I think this is a good time to admit we're a bunch of juvenile piss pants. I'm sorry, Lub. Yes. - Do you have anything to say? - Are you talking to me? Well... - Maybe I overdid it. - You mean you're a selfish asshole. All right, that's enough. - Apologize. - Didn't I just do that? Sorry. Yes, me too. Sorry. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Well, are we continuing the trip? - How much longer from here to Salou? - I think we should continue to Croatia. Ha ha. That's not funny, Lub. Listen, I understand what you're looking for. But trust me, Croatia is the new Salou. But you can't blame us for being a bit suspicious now, can you? I promise - you'll have the trip of a lifetime. - You just want to go to Croatia. I swear on my shitload of cash. Trust me, I'll make sure you stick to that. - Well, to Croatia. - Okay, to Croatia. - To Croatia? - To Croatia. - Lub. Is that a Croatian name? - Slav. - It means "love". - Love. At first we thought you'd be a guy. No. - Lub, who's that on the picture? - She's my daughter, Valerija. Here, Joost. She's mentally challenged. - Why isn't she living in the Netherlands? - I want her to grow up in her country. I don't earn enough in Croatia to pay for her care. And your husband? My husband didn't feel like taking care of a retard. Douchebag. I spy with my little eye green. - The trees to the left. - No. - Trees to the right. - No. Is it the curtain... Can you find it? We're going to Novalja. - Left below Zagreb. - Oh, right. Yes. - Where are we staying tonight? - Not another dive, please. We don't want to insult you, but maybe somewhere nicer. Well, I know a nice place around here. I used to go there with my parents. - But you'll have to trust me. - Right, and you'll gang rape and kill us. Don't worry, Philip. I'm not attracted to cripples. - Touché. - Makes no sense. - How many stars does this hotel have? - Over five stars. - Does that exist? - We can't afford that. She's seriously going to rape and kill us. It's done. I would like to thank you for saving my life this afternoon. - That ditch came up to your knees. - I'm blind. I would have drowned without you. So, thank you. Leaving with three guys and returning with two isn't good for business. Right. Abducting three guys to Croatia is good for business. It's pathetic. I'm watching by myself and I have to call my mom. "Mom, mom, it's about to happen." "Mom, I'm horny." Thank you. You have big plans for this vacation, don't you? Yes. Finding drunk and willing girls who don't care who they're doing it with. Well... - You get that, don't you? - I get it. Could you describe the scenery around here? The fire illuminates our camping spot. But everything around it is pitch-black. Here and there the outline of a tree. - And the sky... - Hey, Lubby? You were right. There are tons of stars. Those crickets, man. I've never heard anything like it. - Is this your first time camping? - Not mine. - I used to go to soccer camp. - It is mine. A disabled guy in a tent. My mom would die just thinking of it. - Call me when you need anything. - Are you going to lie among us? In your dreams. Good night. I've never been this far away from home. Let alone without my mom. It's a big thing. You can be proud of yourself, Joost. - Good night. - Good night. Lub. Can I use your phone? - Mieke speaking. - Mom? - Where are you? - Somewhere in Austria. Austria? Listen, I have to be brief. I just wanted to say I'm fine. Are you crazy? Come home now. That's why I'm calling. I'm alright. We have a kind carer. Joost, come home. I'm so worried... What's that tree called? - A birch. - Oh, right. And the one next to it? - That's a birch as well. - A birch as well... Wait. My mom's the only one who's ever washed me. - I'm very careful. This is my job. - That's not what I mean. I mean... I've never been touched by another woman. I'm afraid that my body... Philip... It's okay. Lars. Dickhead. You know, I've never swum in open water. Want to try? Hey, dudes. Want to go for a swim? And then this girl came up to me. She whispered in my ear if I wanted to come to the beach. - I thought I'd explode. - Then what? - We went to the beach. - We've heard this a 1000 times. But I can't believe it. - Is it really that easy? - Yes, I swear. Didn't you get sand in your schlong? - Huh? - No. Hello? Yes, that's me. How great is it to open a beer when you feel like it? - Without parents nagging at you. - Don't even get me started. Lars? Are you okay? Yes, fine. Lars. Don't mix medication with alcohol. Come on. Lars. Who cares? We're on vacation. In the van. Now. Now. I was just joking, Lub. But maybe it wasn't that funny. Sorry. We're in Croatia, amigos. Hey, Lubby, are we staying in Hotel Lub again tonight? - I've made reservations. - So what? We can cancel. - Last night under the stars? - I can pitch the tents. - A bit lopsided, but who cares? - I can cook. I told you, I've made arrangements. You go ahead. Go ahead. Lars, you dickhead. You ruined it. Gentlemen, please follow me. - Maybe Lub arranged a surprise. - A private lap dance or something. Enjoy. Oh, I love sushi. - Thank God. - Mom? Where do I even start to explain how irresponsible this is? Do you realize how worried we were, guys? - Taxi to the airport is here. - No, no. - Stop this childish behaviour. - Then don't treat me like a child. We're doing well. What the fuck is the problem? The problem is that you damaged our trust. Trust? I can't even go to the kitchen on my own. I do everything for you, sweetheart. Is that right? I think it's in your interest. If you put us on the airplane, I'll scream I'm carrying a bomb. Don't get the idea that this is up for discussion. Is that so? - Let me go. Let me go. - Lars, you're very ill. - Let me out. - We have so little time... Shut up, bitch. Mom... Well... Okay, guys. Go and get your stuff. - Why did you betray us? - I didn't betray you. Joost' mom gave my number to Lars' dad. - What? - What the fuck is this? - I just made a brief phone call to my mom. - When? - At Hotel Lub. - Splendid. Well fucking done, Joost. - Why didn't you just keep on driving? - I had no choice. No choice? My dick has no choice. I'll be in a lot of trouble when they find out I work off the books. And three guys in my van without permission from their parents. So what? You abducted us to Croatia. Lars. I'm sorry. I really am. Joost... Bye, Lub. Stop. Stop. - Sweetheart... - Let go of me. I don't want to... I don't want to die. You have to let us do this. Please. Please, let the boys come with me. I'll take good care of them. I will. I give you my word of honour. Please. Joost, shouldn't you go to sleep? You need your energy tomorrow. No. Who else is there to make sure you keep your eyes open? Open your window. The sea. - We're on a ferry, Joost. - Nice. Let's go and have a look on deck with your eyes. Yes. Hey, Joost. Hey, Philip, we're here. Wake up. - Of our cottage. - Lub, I want to marry you. Philip, how many times? I'm not attracted to cripples. - Is it nice? - Nice. It's fucking awesome. Watch out, Joost. - A pool? - Yeah. You'd rather be in a filthy ditch. Too bad. I brought swimming trunks. You? - Prick. - I'll buy you one, Philip. Lub, this is great, but there's no way we can afford this. Don't worry. - It's a present from your parents. - What? Yo, Lubby, how do we know where the party is around here? I'll drive you to Zrce beach tonight. It has more party than I can handle. - But first you'll join us in the pool. - Yeah, don't you have a bikini? - I don't have the body for a bikini. - So what? Who cares? Look at us. Two lame guys and one blind guy. - Come on, Lub. Jump in. - Yeah, Lub, jump. Nice, Lub. Sexy. Much better than how my mom does it. Oh, shit. I'm afraid I have to tousle it. Does the colour suit me? You'll be fine, Joost. You will. - Want me to help you get changed? - No. Philip and Joost have one as well. My number's in it. Call me right away when something's up. I'm fine. Look after each other, okay? Sure. I'll pick you up in four hours. Have fun. Aren't you coming? I want to spare the girls the competition. Holland. Ajax. Cruijff, Seedorf, Davids. Goeiemorgen. Neuken in de keuken. Amigos, I don't mind getting you a beer, but I can't see the bar. - I'll go. - How? Like this. - It smells of cheap perfume in here. - Those are pheromones, Joost. It's the smell of success. - Hello. Who is that? - Who? That's Else. She's from Sweden. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Your chair. Lars. - Dammit, that idiot is talking to a chick. - Isn't that what we're here for? But he's not in his chair. Oh, sorry for being friendly, fucking whores. Is Lars done yet? I'd like to get out of here. Good evening. Sorry, yes. Fucking hell. What the fuck? Is that prick at the van? - Premature ejaculation? - Philip, leave him alone. I hope that you at least stuck your greasy fingers in her panties. Or are you going to tell us that we looked everywhere for you for nothing? - I just didn't feel well, okay? - You just didn't feel well. It didn't look like that. You moved like a randy goat on the dance floor. Is this how you imagine the three of us on vacation? Ditch us as soon as you get a chance? It must be tough with two retards in tow. Lars, the king of the cunt, knows what a clit looks like up close. Who of those normalos came by when you fell ill? Where were your soccer pals and classmates? Philip, shut up. I've never done it, okay? Pardon? I've never slept with anyone. Incredible. Incredible. I wish I'd never done this. Joost is a traitor, you're a liar. Stop it with that pathetic bullshit for once. Oh, Philip's in a wheelchair. Everyone has to respect him because it's so tough on him. Oh, life is so unfair. Be glad you don't have a fatal tumour in your head. Fucking frustrated loser. Guys... I'd like to take you somewhere. It's... I really think it will help you. It's a high-class place, specifically aimed at disabled people. No way. I didn't go all the way to Croatia to be jerked off by some housewife with a side job. I have friends here who are gorgeous. All those girls in Zrce suck in comparison. That's a strange remark in this context, Lub. So what do you want? Go home? Right when you're fighting? I thought you were amigos with a mission. - Maybe we should do it. - Lars... Come on. Let's just go and have a look. I don't want this. It's okay. Come on. You can stay. I'm going outside. - Josti, what the fuck? - It's okay. Enjoy. They'll probably be upset that the biggest schlong is pulling out. You wanna stay? The valley is very green. Olive trees up front. Vines behind them. Here and there a white house with an orange roof. And right at the back, way off into the distance is the sea. Blue. What do you see? I see... I see all sorts of soft colours that run and flow over into each other. - Joost... - Yes? Will you come with me to Split after this? To my daughter? I'd love to. I'd love to very much. I'm here. And? Yo, yo, yo, dudes. Oh, I'm so proud of you, guys. Josti. Any other wishes? I'd like to sleep beneath the stars again. - Me too. - Me too. What would you do if you weren't disabled? I'd like to do something in nature. Outside all day long. Forest ranger. With tank tracks underneath your wheelchair it's all systems go. And you? Joost? This, right here. I wouldn't mind this every day with a nice girlfriend by my side. - Your mom? - Your mom. Lars? I always wanted to end up in the Dutch soccer team. But... it's no use thinking about that. Why not? You're still here for a long time, Lars. And next year we'll come here again. - Doctors are stupid. What do they know? - Right. To Lars. - Fuck all the doctors. - Yeah, fuck doctors. And to the best trip of my life. To you, amigos. Hey, Lars, look at this. Lars? Hey, Lars. Lars. Adios, amigo. Adios, amigo.
