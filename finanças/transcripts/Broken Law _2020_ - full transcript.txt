You having a cup? No I just had a cup, kettle's boiled. You look awful. Yeah, it's been a bit of a mental week. You're running yourself into the ground, You're going to make yourself sick, you know that? You still drinking this fake milk shite? It all tastes the same after a while. Any news on the place? No, not yet, still looking. I don't know why you're paying rent across the way. When you can be upstairs in your bedroom, saving money. I'm not moving back in with you. I just need to find myself a rich woman. You need to find yourself a social life, working all the hours that God gave you. It's ridiculous, David. Absolutely ridiculous. I need the overtime "Overtime" Where did I hear that one before. I hear the credit center was robbed yesterday. Look you know I can't say much about that at the moment. I know, I know. You all right? You seem in bit of a weird mood. It's Joseph. What about him? I haven't heard from him since he came out. Have you called him? Can you just- I don't have time to be dealing with his problems. Look, you are his older brother. The least you could do is try and help. I'm done trying to straighten him out. If you want to mollycoddle him all your life then go ahead. Okay. But it's about time. He grew up and started treating people with respect. Jesus. Where is this coming from? Where's it coming from? My father's legacy. Our name has been dragged through the dirt and you don't seem to care. I'm fucking sick of it. Legacy. And what the fuck happened to him? Why did he go off the rails like that? I don't know, David. I don't know! Why does anybody go off the rails? Look, I'm busy, I have things to do. What? I'm the one who has to do all the work, you just sit there... I don't want to talk about it anymore. Fuck it. I'll talk to you at home about this. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm here to make a statement. Do you know who you were supposed to be talking to? Wait, you're the guard that almost got me fucking killed yesterday. What the hell were you thinking? I don't know, I was just- You were just what? Trying to be a big fucking hero? You almost got my head blown off. Hey hey hey folks, folks. Keep it down. What's going on? No, this guy-this guard almost got my head blown off yesterday. Madam, madam, would you just- Trying to save me, big fucking hero. Would you step into my office. I'll be within one second. I'm sorry. You're fucking sorry, are you fucking joking? Madam, madam, office please. So I'll be within one second all right? Dave, the fucks going on here? You look like shit. Thanks. - Where are you going? - I have to go see Byrne. Take a look at that. Tell me what you see. Would it pass? You'd have me. Look's the part doesn't it. Yeah Popping up all over the country. Nobody knows where from. What a fucking headache. Anyway. How are you? You look like you didn't get much sleep. I'll survive. Jesus what we were thinking. You could have got everyone killed. I wasn't really, it just, it all kind of happened so fast. You know? Aye, well, We don't fancy losing you. Like we lost your father. You know what Dave? We're not the most popular profession in the world right now. And for good reason. When I first started here, with your father in fact, Jesus we were so wet behind the ears. we thought we could just stroll up the town in our uniform and everyone would just jump into line. How naive we were. Look, David, I want you to do me a favor, right? Now, Amia, if you want to go up to reception I'll be with you in two minutes, all right. You all right? You're looking a bit pale. Yeah I've had better days. Okay, I have to drop this lady home. Will you stick around I need to ask you a few questions? No chance. I was just chatting to Byrne there. All right, fair enough. How is she anyway? She's grand, I think she's just regretting the outburst earlier you know. Look, I'm heading off home now, I can drop her off along the way. If you want, save you the trip. I don't know if that's a good idea. Look, I kind of want to apologize to her properly anyway. Hi. You okay? Excuse me, there's no need to break the window. Ah, Mrs Connolly, how are you, you're looking well. I'm Wallace, I'm Joe's friend, I was just calling- Joe? Where is he? What do you mean, where is he? Have you seen him? Is he not here? No, he's not here. Don't fucking lie to me, you. I told you, he's not here. Where the fuck-don't you fucking lie to me Where is he? I don't know where he is? You don't know where he is? No I don't. If you're lying to me, I'll come back with a knife, I'll stick it up your throat and I'll cut your head off, do you understand? I'll be the last face you ever see. Understand? Say yes. Yes. Look, I'm really sorry. No, no, no, I'm sorry For what? Going off on you earlier. No, look, what I did yesterday was stupid. I could've got somebody killed. Well, you didn't. Look, it's probably none of my business but that guy at the barracks earlier Oh, that. We were arguing about money. Look, you don't have to explain it. No, no, no. I know I don't. I had a gun to my head and all he's worried about is how much compensation we'd get. It looks like you're pretty well set up here anyway. Look's that way. Look, anyway, if you need anything at all, you know where I am, I'm Dave, by the way. I know. Look, take care. Thanks. Hey ma. Joesph, thank god. Sorry Ma, I've been meaning to call you since I got out. Where are you? I've been worried sick. Just been at a friends, you know to just to clear my head and that, you know, Ma, you there? Joe, somebody called by earlier on, looking for you He wouldn't believe me when I said I didn't know where you were. Don't worry about him, did you let him in the house? Of course I didn't. Who is he? Don't worry about him, he's just some eejit I used to know. I'm really worried Joe. Please, come home. I know, I will, I just need a little bit of time with that, you know? Look Ma, I have to go, all right? I love you and that, all right? Bye. Yeah, what's up? Seen that cunt yet? Right keep your eyes and ears peeled, You hear me, and ring me back straight away. Right, go on. How'd you know she's not lying? She's not. Sure, he was asking me where he was before I got the chance to ask her. The little prick is looking at me texts and all. Most trustworthy person you know? Jesus fucking Christ I need my head examined. He better surface. Yeah, he will. And when he does I'm going to bury him below the surface, now rack them up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a bleeding ball missing you fucking thicky. Don't be giving me them looks. Following a report of an incident in Newtown place on Tuesday. Some CCTV footage of the attempted robbery has been released online and is now going viral on social media. In the video released on the Irish times website.

Don't go killing me fucking buzz now, copper. What's this shite you have on here? Don't touch that man, leave that track on - Leave that tune on - You've had your chance now, though. Let me see here Jesus, typical guard, no taste. Oh, me trousers! I have to wear this to work tomorrow. I hope they can fucking smell it on you in the station. This is fucking... oh, Damo Dempsey.

What are you thinking about? I'm just a horrible person. Why? Because I'm married and I'm in bed with you. Yeah, but you're unhappy. You know you've told him, he knows. Yes, but it doesn't make it right. Look, it's not ideal for me either. It's crazy we've only known each other a week. Yeah I know, it feels like longer. If the robbery hadn't have happened I would have never met you. You okay? Yeah. What's wrong then? Nothings wrong. That's what's wrong. Who are you stalking now? Your Ma.

And we've been told a special commemorative plaque has been made in his honor to mark his anniversary. You must be very proud of him. Oh yeah, of course. Yeah. I was only 13 when it happened, but yeah. All my life growing up, I wanted to be just like him. Well if you don't mind me saying, you have him so proud.

You don't want me to drive then? No, I'm all right. Some people grow up idolizing different people throughout their lives whether it be football or superheroes or musicians or whatever, but I always want it to be like my father. For some reason, I could always admire him but never fully relate to him. I'll be honest. It was only recently that I really got to know him. He's not just a heroic story to me anymore. He was a human being with human needs and human flaws. And I think that's something that we can all identify with. We also have a tendency sometimes to overlook the real heroes, the ones who don't get the headlines but who play just as an important part in our lives. Anyway, I'm not great at these things. So I just want to thank everyone for coming out and remembering my father and, yeah. That's me done. Can the Connelly family join us for a picture please. And Richard, come on, join us. You're a good friend. Gardai believe these criminals are responsible for a large number of counterfeit bills in circulation around the city over the last few weeks.
