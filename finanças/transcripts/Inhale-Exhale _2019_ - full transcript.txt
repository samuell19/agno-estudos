INHALE - EXHALE Smile when you enter, OK? Here we are! My darling! All right, come here! My sweet darling! Come on, sit down. Just a moment. So, my wife has become a Crime Lord today. What? A Mob Boss. Haven't seen you for ages. I feel like crying. I want to propose a toast to this marvellous day! Come on, join me and show me your smiling faces! Oh, come on. Please, don't take that stuff. Oh, I thought you'd say something interesting. I spoke to the doctor and he said it's rubbish. You shouldn't take it. Believe me it's shit. But Omax does not help. It makes me sick. I know better, stop it! Just stop it and leave him alone. Ok, let's stop it. Sorry. - Can I make a toast? - Please do. Please don't drink wine. - I'm not drinking, Mum. - Please don't. I'm not drinking, Mum. It's bad for your liver. Have all of you conspired against me? It's bad for your liver. I'm not a toddler you know! don't make me jump out of the window. I'll smash this table! You know my nerves are fucked up! I'm fed up with all these restrictions. Come on, drink it. But It's bad for his liver too. I don't know how to put it, but let's drink to the unification of the family. Let's drink to this wonderful day! What a fool! I can't stand it any longer. Are you tired? I see that you are. It's OK. I always wondered how you were in jail. Tell me. Is it for women only? Almost. And how did you get along? Have you been to Paris? Yes, I went there two years ago. Alone? Of course, I wouldn't go with this ass-hole. Paris is fantastic. Something miraculous. Sopo has come. Sopo! Mum! Stay in this room if you want. Sit for a moment. Do sit down! You have to talk to me some day. Mum, I'll come and help you tomorrow. Oh, stop it. Call me! Smile, please! See you! It's late already you should sleep now. What's going on in this family? Are you always like that? Sort of. Since you left. What's wrong with you? I'm on methadone treatment. For two years already. Tamuna helped me and Kakha to get in that program. She used her connections. Tamuna was supporting you, wasn't she? Yes, she used to come every other day. Izo is still in good shape. And the children? Were they often ill? Sometimes. Tengo would get some infection at school. Then he would infect Sopo. They had slight fever, nothing serious. When did Sopo's menstrual cycle start? What are you asking? Are you crazy? Ask Tamuna or Izo about it. What about your job? Nothing much. A couple of times Guja took me to work in his club, as a guard. The first time I spent the money to celebrate Tengo's birthday. And the second time I bought medicine for Mum's blood pressure. Reading a fairy-tale: "who is there?" "Please take me to the other side of the river" Sopo, can you tell me where the cake molds are? They are in the basement, as always. You know what the giant did? He got hold of him and... Mum arrived from Greece and I couldn't leave. Was it good? I saw the photos. You got drunk for sure. What an idiot! OK, I have to go now. Call me and I'll come later. Kisses! Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive them that trespass against us. And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen. God bless us! God bless us! Former prisoners often complain that they find it hard to start life anew. Frequently they don't have homes, money, family or friends left. We have gathered here today, my friends, to help anyone who needs our support. If a former prisoner is not ready to reintegrate into the society, There is a risk of repeated crime. And the society is unprotected. Our aim is to improve the social skills of former prisoners. We must teach them how to use these skills in practice. Our training consists of several important topics: Efficient communication, management of anger and aggression, Improvement of qualification, Employment opportunities, Time management, Introduction to State services and so on. I see ladies in the audience. Woman's health is one of our priorities. We do our best to succeed in this direction. We have to take care of potential mothers. A healthy way of life: life without tobacco. Getting up early in the morning. All this should become part of our daily life. Very few of you speak English, Very few of you have computer skills, Which of you knows how to write a CV or a motivational letter? None of you does. Hi. - Does Luka live here? - What do you want? I've got a letter for him. It's from prison. Come in. Sorry for the mess. It's all right. Sit down. I'm a friend of your mother. How is she? She has cancer. - Cancer of what? - Lung. You mean she is dying? She got worse before I left. Will she die soon? She didn't want me to visit her there. She was ashamed because of me. She didn't say anything to me. What's your name? Irina. I think your skin is dry. Come to my beauty salon, and I'll see to it. Will you come? I will. That's nice! Where did you get it? I borrowed it from children's theatre. - Are you nervous? - No. My sweet darling! This goes here! My boy! Shall we revise the text? Start! Glorious King! Glorious King! Treason! The enemy is attacking us! Now the second one. Take this! Death to the traitor! Oh! It started again! I can't feel my leg! Please, bring me hot water. Now repeat it again! Glorious King! Treason! The enemy is attacking us! You say that later. - What time does it start? - Six. Now say: "Death to the traitor" Death to the traitor! My little darling! Great warrior! I can't feel my leg at all! I've touched you last! I've touched you last! Come on, turn to me. Death to the Traitor! Did you get Tengo vaccinated? Yes. He had all the necessary injections. Did he have any side effects? Nothing serious. It's still hot. I'll take it when it gets cooler. When did Sopo have her first periods? Two years ago. She was thirteen then. You have an affair with someone? Yes. Who? He's a water polo player. He works at the City Council too. He's crazy about me. He's really cute. And how about Kakha? Oh, come on. Kakha has nothing to do with it. He is such a nice guy! And how are you? Fine, very well. Granny! Granny! What is it, darling? Do you want anything? Are you scared? Please, don't be. We are here. Don't be afraid Just lie down and sleep. Dad, will you buy me Jack Sparrow's costume? Sure. I sure will. Sleep now. - You are Irina, right? - Yes. This is our temporary space. We are under reorganization, scattered through different locations. I am Tornike Kvashali, your personal social worker. How do former prisoners live and what are their problems? How are they reintegrated into the community? This is what I am researching, based on individual cases. I am preparing biological, social and psychological evaluation, I make conclusions and recommendations. After the evaluation, we make an individual service plan. We evaluate... We evaluate... erm... We provide services to our beneficiaries. Thus, I am your friend, and I'm ready to listen to you. Here is the doctor's prescription. I have no money to buy this. They told me you'd help. This issue must be discussed by a special committee. How old are you, Irina? Sorry. Let's go on then. How old are you? Thirty-seven. Irina, the program for former prisoners consists of three directions. First: helping to solve physical and psychological problems. Second: professional training. Third: support of employment. I need a job badly. Irina, we send the data of former prisoners to various organizations. If they are interested, you get a job. Here are two tickets for synchronic swimming. And this is the invitation card for anti-stress yoga. By the way, Miss Fripp herself gives classes there. Please take it as a small gift from us. Irina, how are you? - I'm fine and you? - I'm fine too. - What are you doing here? - Searching for a job. - So? - Nothing yet. And why are you here? Attending yoga classes. With that foreign woman? Yes, her name is Ana. - Do you know her? - We've just met. Is it interesting? Yes. Very much. Ok, See you. I want to find out who I am. What can you say about Ana? She's cute. She really helps me. She's the only person in this town you can share problems with. If she can't help, she will at least listen. Ana has a friend in Tbilisi, who works at the President's Administration. She says she will talk to him about my mother's amnesty. She hopes to achieve something in this situation, But I don't think she'll make it. Once we had a woman who was severely ill. The family managed to free her. I don't know, maybe it's possible. Ana helps me too. She helped me with the visa documents. We are expecting the answer in three weeks. She promises everything will be fine. If I go there, I'll have a chance to help Mum. At least by sending her money. I can't stay here any longer. Shall we go shooting? One more left. I have won a prize. What prize? The chicken. What chicken? - Don't look at me like that! - Like what? Like that. Give me my chicken. You had to hit all of them. - You said five were enough. - I said six. Give him his prize. - Take the gun away! - I said: give it! Here! Take it! Is Mum very thin now? Yes. Did you go to jail the same year? The same day. Why don't you ask me what I was detained for? And why don't you ask me why I am so beautiful? You are very beautiful too. What did you do before jail? I was a nurse. Your majesty! The Warlord is here! Call the Warlord! Glorious King! Treason! The enemy is attacking us! Tell me who the traitor is! Sopo, why did you say I was in Greece? What does it matter? It does! What should I have said? That my Mum is a drug dealer? That she stole drugs and sold them? Who told you that? - Your Dad? - No, Izo did. And leave Dad alone. Sometimes I can't feel my legs. No sensitivity at all. That shampoo is not for children, take the other one! Leave me alone! Let Granny wash me! Granny, you wash me! I can't. I have a pain in my leg. Sopo! You wash him! I can't. What is it? Can't I eat? If it's forbidden, why does she bring cakes? Tell me why? Mum, tell me why do you keep bringing cakes? If sweet things are forbidden for me, why do you bring them? Pass me that cloth. I want to go to my mother's grave. Some other time, please. I get tired on the road. I feel nauseated. You know I have diarrhea. I hate stopping the car and going to the toilet all the time. OK, I'll go alone. I don't understand what kind of sport this is. I don't understand hockey either. Why didn't you commit suicide? What are you after? You mean I had to go to prison with you? Is that what you wanted? We had talked it over. What was I to do? How could I leave these fools alone? Two children? My mum? That ass-hole Kakha, and my sister? My sister has her own things to do. Someone had to stay outside the jail and take care of the family. What the fuck do you want? And did you solve any of the family problems? What do you mean? You should have told everyone that it was not only my fault. Fuck off and stop getting on my nerves. Or I will strangle you, fucking bitch! Now that she's out, she feels important. Asks me why didn't I kill myself. How do you know? I was thinking about it every night. Just stop speaking that rubbish. And don't sit here with a calm expression on your face. There has been an accident! My God! What's going on? There has been an accident! How awful! The ambulance is here! Is anyone dead? Let's get off, quick! We need help! Come, help us, someone! Get a stretcher! One man here, quick! Now all together! One, two, three! I had a serious problem with constipation. I couldn't shit for weeks. Then the doctor prescribed Guttalax, it's a Dutch medicine. It's very effective. It helped me a lot. It tastes like syrup, like medicine for babies. I took it a couple of times, and it worked wonders. I was shitting perfectly. Then Chiko, Kakha's friend, he's a doctor. He told me about Daffolac, similar drug, produced in Hungary. The second day I took it. And it poisoned me, like a mushroom. Maybe there was a chemical reaction with methadone. I had constipation for two weeks. I couldn't shit at all. Then mother called the ambulance. But I nearly died. What's up? What's going on here? What the hell is going on? Shame on you. Just look at yourself. Careful! - Let me help you! - Leave me alone! What a smell! Do something, or I'll kill myself! Fuck it! What the fuck have you drunk? Never seen anything like it! Stop shouting at her! It's your fault. Look at your granddaughter. You have spoilt her. What's my fault? It's your own fault. Just look at yourself in the mirror. I'll strangle you! You old bitch! Get out! I hate you! Old witch! I say it's your fault! I have a pain in the stomach! Fuck you all! These bastards go to the sixteenth floor, drink and smoke there. They take drugs. As if my problem wasn't enough! Fucking ass-holes! Close your eyes. There is only you and the Universe. We need to breathe to connect. And find our inner selves. Inhale, exhale... Listen to yourself. What do you want? Listen to your inner desires. Follow your inner desires. Don't be ashamed. Don't be afraid. Listen to your desires. Be yourself. And you will be happy. Inhale, exhale... It's so fuckin tasty. My leg! My leg! I can't feel my leg. Stop it, Mum! Bring it here, darling. Irakli, can you add some hot water? Oh, come on. You bring it to her. Pour it. She has burnt me! So she feels her leg! This bitch has burnt me! This ugly rat! Are you nuts? Stop, you ass-hole! Fuck my life and fuck you all! Does it hurt? She has burnt me! This devil! Can I look into the mirror when you are finished? Are you in love with anyone? No, but I have found a boy recently. I contacted him by internet. He is a miner. - Who? - He works in the mine. I can't decide whether to meet him or not. I'm a little scared. I'm giving a party on Saturday. Will you come? If you come, I'll lend you this dress. Do you like it? I decided to meet that guy. Ana said I must meet him for sure. And I will see him. Hi! Is Luka here? Will he come today? Luka has been killed. What?! He was found tortured in the forest. Bring the fourth. Just a moment. Come here, please. Your body is a box. Your spirit is immortal. There is only your spirit and the universe. We have to breathe to connect to the universe. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Sopo, honey, forgive me, please! I love you so much! Mum!
