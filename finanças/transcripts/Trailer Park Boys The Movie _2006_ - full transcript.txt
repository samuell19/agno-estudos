(phone ringing) (Julian's recorded voice): This is Julian. Leave a message. (beep) - Hey, Julian, it's Ricky. I got your message about working tonight. I guess I can probably work, but I'm telling you one thing, I'm need to get drunk as fuck. And I need some good fuckin' dope, Julian, if I'm working for you tonight. Not that shitty fuckin' mall dope you usually show up here with. Let's get high, let's get drunk, and we'll do this fuckin'job. (beep) (birds chirping) (motorcycle rumbles) (Julian): Did I tell him to meet us 15 minutes ago? - Yes. (cellphone rings) - It's Ricky. Where the hell are ya?! - Where is he? - Listen, I told you to be ready 15 minutes ago! - I gotta do some family stuff. Lucy's freakin'... (knocking at door) Hey, Rick. Are you talking on the phone to Julian? (whispering) - Just a second. No, I'm just in here using the bathroom. - Why do have to lie to her? Why can't you just tell her, "I need to make some money to support the family." Huh? - Look, if you're masturbating, it's cool. Just say, "Hey, I'm masturbating." No big deal! - Yeah, I'm masturbating big-time, Lucy. - Should you be on the phone with him if he's masturbating? (loud banging) ...stuff cooked? Stuff... Jesus Christ! I'm trying to talk to Tony here! The only reason Lucy's pissed off is because we don't have a lot of money right now. I'm not growing dope and I spent our grocery money. I was wrong. - I want him close to me. I want him to be Trinity's father. He is a good parent. But until he stops working with Julian, he can forget about being inside. - Lucy says I can't come in the trailer. No big deal. I'm used to living in cars. I've been living in cars most of my life. And people kinda make fun of me, throw bottles at me, say, "How can you live in a car?" But they just don't understand. It's not that bad. (spritz) The way I look at it, my car is kinda like ourfamily's cottage. Trin comes out. She helps me cook and stuff. We have a good time. Lucy comes out to the car once in awhile, we smoke some dope, get drunk. - I'll bang Ricky. I'll go visit him in his car. I don't give a shit, but he is not having sex with me in my bed. - I've got everything I need out here. Enough make my own food and take care of myself. I don't owe anybody anything in this park. I don't pay lot fees, 'cause I live in my car. It's awesome. And basically my attitude is, I don't cause problems in this park. You don't fuck with me, I'm not gonna fuck with you. But don't fuck with me, 'cause I'm gonna start fuckin' with you big-time. (car rumbles loudly) - Oh, fuckin' look who it is. - I don't know what he's doing here. Julian, what's going on? What are you doing here? - We don't have time for this, Ricky. Let's go! (Lucy): Yeah, you're getting drunk tonight, but you're also working. - I'm gonna call into work for a couple of hours. I'm sorry. They couldn't find Cory and Trevor; if I don't work, I'm getting fired. And we need the money, you know that. Lucy, come here. Look, I'll only gonna be working for a couple hours. I'll stop and get a big bucket of chicken, go to the liquor store, get some great hash. We'll get drunk, smoke some dope, and we'll bang tonight, listening to April Wine. - Getting chicken and banging, that's nice. (door squeaks open) - Fine. Be careful. - I will. (door slams) - Here's the clearing stick, Ricky. (everything clatters and smashes on the ground) (heavy rock music) (car quietly rumbles) (Julian): All right, Bubbs, black it out. (spray can rattles) (Ricky): These fuckin' shitty tools. (drill whirs) (Julian): Move it, move it. (Bubbles whispering): All right, it's clear. (Ricky): All right, Jules. (loud banging) (banging continues, snowmobile hums loudly) (Ricky): What the fuck is that?! (Cory): What's up, dudes?! - Where's the bank machine we're gonna rob?! (Ricky): Turn that shit off! (Trevor): Sorry, Ricky. - What are you guys thinking? (rapid tapping, loud music stops) - What are you guys doing? This is the big show. You show up late, you blow our cover? Eh, boys? We are never, ever, working with you idiots again. (tape clatters on ground) And... I'm really considering not hanging out with you guys anymore. (Cory): What? - You don't have to do that, Ricky. - Ricky, you really hurt Cory and Trevor's feelings there. - Bubbles, they're the stupidest fuck giraffes in the dumb-dumb salad. - Fuck giraffes. Look, Ricky, I know, but you made them cry. (Cory, tearful): We're a little sick of messing up, Julian, every time. - That's not right. They're ourfriends. Now apologize. - I didn't mean to make them cry. - Ricky, get over here and apologize to these guys. - Jesus Christ. (Trevor): You don't have to bother apologizing, Ricky. (Julian): Come on. - Cory, Trevor, I'm sorry I made you guys cry, all right? (Trevor): I'm not crying. - Now get the fuck out of here. You gotta go. (drill whirs) (drill rattles) (snowmobile hums) - Fuck! - Ricky, don't electra-cocksuck yourself now. Delicate, Ricky, delicate! (whimpers) - That's blue dye under pressure. That whore blows and we all look like those blue, bald-headed dicks that beat the drums. (Ricky): Got it! (car creaks and squeals) - I'm surprised. This is going really well, boys. (loud crash) (glass shatters, metal clanks) (alarm goes off) - Holy fuck! My car! I don't have fuckin' insurance! - Let's get the hell out of here, now! - Wait, Julian. - Ricky, come on! - Two seconds. - Ricky, I'm leaving without ya! - Julian, I'm taking a couple of cartons of cigarettes. Big deal! (car zooms) - Just a couple of cartons of smokes, eh, Ricky? - Bubbles, they were free. I couldn't leave them there. I think we're okay, boys. (steady beating of helicopter rotors) - Boys, there's something flying behind us right now that looks just like a police hell-a-cocksucker. (hard rock music) There's a fuckin' hell-a-cocksucker behind us! What do we do?! - Get rid of the evidence! - This fucker gonna get to us, Julian? (Pilot over radio): I've got visual contact heading due east Highway 7. - Julian, you gotta pull over, man. I gotta piss! - Ricky, we're being pursued by the cops! No! Not gonna happen! - I can't hold it! I can't! (tires screech) Sorry, Julian, but I am not gonna piss myself, man! - Out of the car, Bubbs. - I'm not going anywhere without you guys! - We're gonna get busted, Bubbles. Come on! (helicopter rotors beat loudly) (helicopter rumbles) (Pilot):This guy's stopped. He's urinating. He just pissed on himself here. (helicopter rumbles) - You better not put this on the fuckin' news! God, that was a good piss! (police siren wails) Fuck. Fuck. (more sirens wail) - I told you not to stop! - No big deal. We can talk our way out of this. - I'm gonna freeze up. I can't do this. - Don't move! Hands where I can see them! Stop right there! - Hey, guys, how you doing? - Where are you coming from? - Just back at the mall. - We're not asking you. We're asking the guy with the mixed drink, driving the car. What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? - Oh, real nice. Making fun of a guy who can't speak. He's mute. He's deaf, too. You got some jokes for that? Maybe you can make him cry. Anyway, guys, I'm Trevor. This is Cory. Just put the guns away, guys. You don't need your guns out. We don't got fuckin' guns. Put the guns down, seriously. We don't need guns. Put 'em away. (flicks lighter open) Talk it out. I know why you're pulling us over. We set the alarms off at the mall again, which is no big deal, because we're the window cleaners. Terry, a guy that works with us, idiot, backs his truck in and slams into the smoke shop, set the alarm off. Friend of mine, so I took the cigarettes. Didn't want anyone to steal them. Anyway, we're gonna go back, fix it up, no problem at all. Guys, you gotta understand here. I could lose my job over this and I've got four kids. - What you doing running a police chopper, Trevor, with four kids? - We wasn't. I knew some shit was obviously fucked up and we saw the big, stupid chopper in the sky and pulled right over. Seriously, we're just gonna get goin'. We got a lot of work to do, fixing that window and everything. - All right, Frank. Listen, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna go back, clean up, get the alarms off, call the security company, so we don't have to deal with it. All right? - No problem. - Once you're done with that, you gotta get this car legal as soon as you can, okay? You got lucky tonight. - You guys are really good cops. You guys did... it was great. The way you had the chopper... - Yeah, yeah... You were right on us. It was good. - Thanks, Officer. - All right, take off. - Appreciate it. - What about you, Cory? You got kids? - No. (disgusted sigh) - Out of the vehicle. - I fuckin' had these dummies, Julian! They're stupid! - Out of the car! - You had to take a piss, didn't you? You fuckhead! - You were supposed to be deaf! That door doesn't work! Take him out this side, please! - Oh, nice sign language, Rick! What the fuck was that? - I'm trying here, Julian! (music) - He's not a bad goalie, but he's dumb. Ya suck, Ricky! Get off the court! I told you guys, your time is up! - Suck it, Donny. - You suck it... more! - What kind of a comeback was that? I said suck it and you just added "more" to it. - Because it's more. You suck it more. - Fuckin' cocky chop, fuck-linker. Let's go, boys. - That didn't make any sense. Watch when you talk to me. You're spittin' all over. (Ricky): You guys fuckin' suck. Donny is a fuckin' prick. He's a senior guard, and he's jealous, 'cause I came up with the ball-hockey-league idea. I'm having a good time. I've got 26 days left. I plan on playing ball hockey every day and beating the guards in the hockey toumament. And Julian, Julian's not having a good time. He just drinks potato vodka and lifts weights. And I've seen a lot of guys go down that road. It's not a good road to go down. He's not happy in here, and he should be playing hockey. If he was playing hockey and smoking dope, Julian would be so much happier than lifting weights and drinking potato vodka. That's what he chooses to do, I guess. - Tell me something, how did you get the name Cadillac, anyway? - Because I'm smooth, I drive straight, and I got power- personal power. Took old Cadillac 29 years to figure it out. Alot of times, the cons get out of jail, right? And they want to do the big dirty, that one big job - you know, make a lot of money, retire. They end up retiring back in here. I did the big dirty. You see where I am? Forget the big dirty when you get out. Don't do that. - Lots of guys here say the big dirty's the way to go. You find one big job, do it right - no witnesses. 'Cause witnesses give up prescriptions to the police; once the police has your prescription, you're fucked. - It's all about change, boy. Change and nothing else. - I'm a criminal, Cadillac. I can't change now, man. - I ain't talking about that kind of change. (whispers quietly) - That's brilliant, man. - So if I do the big dirty, then I can retire from crime, have all the time in the world to spend time with my family; get my family life going again. So that's what I'm doing. Soon as I get out of here, I'm doing the big dirty. It's fuckin' perfect. - All right! (whistle blows) News flash! Line up! Hurry up. (lnmate): Fuck off, Donny, you dick! - Who said that?! (singsongy): Look what I got. You're not gonna like this. Well, ladies, I got some news for ya! - Donny, what are you doing? - I'll tell ya what I'm doing, Ricky. This prison's overcrowded with dicks and muscle dummies! So I put in a word with the warden to let Ricky and Julian out 26 days early! (cheering wildly) - Don't forget change, man, change. - I won't. I won't. - Don't forget my box of shit, all right? My box of shit, baby. (whistle) - What are you doing? - Fuckin' prick. - Do you not see the red line, Cadill-ass? Movie night is done because of Cadill-ass! (prisoners groaning) - Fuckin' asshole! I can see what you're fuckin' doing here, Donny. You're fixing the hockey tournament, 'cause you know you can't win if I'm playing on the nets. - Let it go, Ricky. (mimics Julian) - Let it go, Ricky. You and your pretty hair and your blue eyes shining like the sky, huh? Shut up. - I'm not leaving. I got 30 days left. I'm serving every one of them, then we're gonna fuckin' kick your ass in hockey. - You're in jail and I'm gonna let you out of jail and you want to stay for a stupid ball-hockey tournament? - 'Cause we're gonna win and you know it. - You're not gonna to win Ricky. - And you're attracted to Julian. - I'm not attracted to Julian. I'm attracted... Ahem. I'm not attracted to Julian. - You keep going on about his blue eyes, his nice hair and everything. - 'Cause that's what you do. - Sounds a little weird to me. - No, it's not weird. Shut up. - I'm not fuckin' leaving. - You're leaving. - No, I'm not fuckin' going anywhere. - Wanna prove it? - Sure. - Prove it. Leonard, Duncan... - Aw, you got to be kiddin'. - Get this prick out of my jail. - This is such bullshit, Donny. Gonna throw me out of jail, huh? I've got every right to be in this fuckin' jail, serve my sentence! (struggling grunts) Darren, you gotta play nets! Wayne, don't get drunk before the games! Steve, move up to left wing! Fuck sakes, you fuckers! If I fuckin' see you on the outside, Donny, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass! - Ricky, I'll fight you anyplace, any time, anywhere. (into intercom): - Donny, it's Ricky. Look, man, I'm sorry I freaked out. You gotta please let me back in jail. Please let me play in the hockey toumament. Donny, come on. I'm sorry. (Donny over intercom): - No chance, Ricky. You suck it! - No matter how many times those guys go to jail, it just never gets easier. I mean, me and Ricky and Julian, we grew up together and we're closer than brothers, so... I mean, when they go to jail, everything just stops for me. I just end up, you know, working on dirty old shopping carts. (loud crash) Fixing them up, selling them back to the grocery stores. I only make about 80 bucks a month. You know, just enough for cat food and lot fees. Who's a good boy? (cat purrs) Half the time, all I can do is just mark off days on the calendar, waiting for them to get out. (music plays on the radio) - Dad! Bubbles! (Ray): I'm really proud of my boy, Rick, 'cause as soon as he gets out of jail, he goes right back to work. I, unfortunately, haven't been able to work since the accident, so... stuck in this thing. It sucks. But, you know, at least I get a government disability check every month and, you know, I... keep getting one, you know, as long as I'm careful, so... (music plays on radio) (Julian): Hey, Ray. - Boys. Hey, Ricky. - Hey, Dad. - Aw, man, is it ever good to see you. I missed you, buddy. - I missed you too, bud. (sniffs) - No way. - You got me some dope plants? - Check it out. - Old man came through! - Ah, yeah. - Check it out, boys! Hey, Bubbles. - Ricky! - Dad, let me tell ya, thinked over a lot of stuff in jail. It's just gonna come about my family now. I gotta be a better dad for Trin, and I want Lucy back. (Cory): Yeah, dude, what's up?! All right! Okay, we'll followyou! - What do the fuck do these dicks here think they're doin'? (Julian): Don't start any shit with them, Rick. - Exit the vehicle, please, gentlemen. Heard you boys were getting out today. Welcome back to Sunnyvale, Julian. - Jim. - Ricky. We need to go over some new park laws, boys. - What? You're not a cop anymore, remember? You got fired. You're just a drunk trailer-park supervisor now. Capeek? - Actually, I resigned from the force, Ricky. - Resigned? - Yeah, I make, uh, $16,500 here, at Sunnyvale, as supervisor. Randy makes $4,600. That's pretty good money. First 10 years I ran this park, things were simply perfection. Trailers were well-kept, people respected each other. Then things changed. Things changed with Julian, Bubbles and... mostly Ricky. - Better watch the way you speak to Mr. Lahey, Rick! - You betterwatch the way you go fuck yourself, Randy. - Ricky! Ricky! It's all right! It's all right! Come on, look, we got catching up to do. Let's just go. - I'll tell you right now, leave us alone! Go get drunk, supervise the park. - Mr. Lahey hasn't had a drink in almost two months! Come on, Ricky, let's start things off on the right foot here. - All right, Randy. I've been a bit stressed out lately. Shouldn't be takin' it out on you guys. Sorry, Jim. Didn't realize you quit drinking. - Rick. - We don't want any trouble here, guys. Okay? - Julian. This is great, boys. Listen, we all want the same thing. For Sunnyvale Trailer Park to be a nice place to live, just like it used to be. - No problem, Mr. Lahey. We're just happy to be home. So, we good here? Can we go through the gate now? - Sure, Rick. Keep your nose clean. (car starts up) Randy, open the gate. - Won't be necessary, Randy. You guys can both fuck off. (gate clatters) (loud music thumps from back of snowmobile) - Randy, don't let me start drinking again, bud. (snowmobile rumbles to a stop) - Wazzup?! - Wazzup?! - Wazzup? I told you to stop saying that three years ago. Now get the fuck away from me. Come up with somethin' better. Cory and Trevor are so fuckin' stupid. They run around saying they got their grade six, but nobody remembers them in grade six. I remember them in grade five. But one thing I do know about Cory and Trevor, their brains work on the same level as horses. I mean, they look around like horses. They hear a loud noise they get scared like a horse. They're unpredictable. Just so fuckin' dumb. See you guys later, all right? - Stay for a couple drinks with the boys. Come on, you just got out. - I'm spending the night with Lucy tonight. I'm getting drunk with my family. - What are Bubbles, Julian and the old man, if not yourfamily? - Come to Lucy's. We'll get stoned, get drunk as fuck. It'll be a great night. I gotta go, though. (Bubbles): Ricky? Rick! God, Ray, should we have told him what's going on with Lucy? - No, man, he's... he's gotta figure this one out for himself, buddy. (car screeches to a halt) (car rattles) - You're a month early. - What the fuck are you doing here? - I live here, Ricky. You think Lucy can pay the rent by herself? - I'm out of jail now, so I'll be taking care of the fees, 'cause I'm gonna be making a shitload of money. - I want you to stay the fuck away from Lucy and Trinity. I'm serious. - I want to talk to Lucy and Trinity right now. I'm fuck-offious. - Excuse me! Excuse me! - Lucy's not gay anymore, Sarah. She hasn't done gay shit since high school. - Lucy never graduated from high school, Ricky. - I never graduated either and I'm not gay. - That's not what I heard. - What, were you talking to Julian? I knew Lucy was only an eighth gay. She banged a lot of chicks back in high school, including Sarah. I banged a lot of chicks back in high school, including Sarah, so it kinda cancels out. One night, me and Lucy got drunk, started talking, realized both of us were banging a lot of the same chicks. One thing led to another, kinda got together, and we're just going from there. - Oh, you haven't heard about Lucy's new job yet, have you? - Lucy's working? - She's got an awesome new job. - What new job? She working down at Horton's again? - She doesn't need you anymore for anything. Nice flowers. - What're you talking about, Sarah? (door clatters shut) Where is she, Sarah?! - She's in "fuck-off land," Ricky! - Ricky worries me sometimes. I got a great plan here and I need him. He's my wingman. Don't need him gettin' all screwed up over Lucy. We don't have time for chicks right now. We gotta steal change. - How many hotdogs do you want, Julian? - Four. - Four?! - Well, I guess I don't get any, then. 'Cause Ray's gonna have half o' them! - Give me two, then. - No, no! Oh, yeah, so you... you just get out of jail and now you're telling me you're gonna be robbing change out of parking meters. That's fuckin' just great, Julian. - Bubbs, it's way safer. You can't go to jail. We just got to talk Ricky out of doing the big dirty. It's stupid. Hey. - Hey, Ricky. - Hey, Rick. - Hey, buddy. - Listen, Dad, Bubbs, is there something you guys aren't telling me about Lucy? - Bubbs, why don't you, uh...? - Ray, you... (unintelligible mumbling) - Why do you always stick me with the horseshit?! Lucy got new boobs, Ricky. - Lucy got new boobs? Why? Lucy's body's perfect. - You oughta see it now, buddy. - Dad. You saw Lucy naked? - Down at the Gentleman's Club, Rick. - They're not too big and they're not too small. - Trevor, how the fuck did you see Lucy naked? - At the Gentleman's Club. She works at the Gentleman's Club, Ricky. That's what we're saying. - The strip club? (everyone): Gentleman's Club. (Platinum Blonde's "Doesn't Really Matter" begins) (singing along with song) It's been a hard day In the city And it affects you in the most peculiar way Straights! (song continues) We've said all that there is to say And if you were to ask me questions You don't really want to know Your concern is just for show Just for show-oh-oh-oh Your name's a number Just press a button Your memories lost but they've not forgotten They tried to break our... our lust for passion They tried to tell us that it's not in fashion And if you were to ask me questions What are we fighting for... - Hey. - Hey. - Lucy, I just came here to see you. Can I have a hug? I really missed you, in jail. - Okay, close enough. There you go. Nice big hug. - Oh, that was a nice hug. - Mmm-hmm. - So how's Trinity doing? - Off the rails is how she's doing. She's stealing barbecues again. Yeah, things are really different now, Rick. Really different. - Why, are you bangin' somebody or somethin'? - Hey, Sonny, this is Ricky. - Ricky, good to meet you, buddy! How are ya? I've heard a lot about you. - Rick, this is Sonny, my boss. - I own the joint. What can I tell you? So is everything good? You gettin' everything you need? - Yeah, we're fine. - Great. It's a $10 cover. - Oh, you know what? He's my guest. Here's 10 bucks. - Stop digging in the ashtray, will you, buddy? This is a gentleman's club. - Look, I'm properly gentlemanly. I just came here to talk to Lucy. You got a problem with that? - Can you just give us a minute? Can we talk? - Yeah, hey, no problem. What do you need? You know, it's a two-drink minimum, and no touching the ladies, Ricky, especially her. You got two minutes. (slaps arm) Attaboy. I'm gonna need you in the VIP room. - Okay. - Fuckin' dick! (Bubbles): You know how much it is to get into that room? Twenty bucks! You know how much cat food I'd get for that?! - Good job, boys. Go find some more. - Try to get me a vodka o.j. - I'm drinking gin and Seven, please. - I'm drinking rum and Coke. - Oh. Okay. You're good. You're good. You're good. Okay. - Are you fucked?! - She's just trying to hustle me for lap dances and drinks. It's part of her job. Chill out. - So?! - Listen. We have no time for women right now. We gotta concentrate on the job tomorrow and stay focused, okay? - I'm focused, Julian. (whispers) She's looking over here. - Is she? - Julian, she's on fire! God, this place makes me frisky! - Lucy, it's not just about horny stuff this time. There's love stuff, too. - Listen, we could have a couple drinks, take care of the homy stuff, but that's it. - Any chance I can get a couple of cigarettes off ya? - Look, I gotta go. No matterwhat happens between you and me, you gotta start growing dope, and you gotta get some money. You gotta get your life together. - Look... I didn't mean to be so forward... earlier, you know? I don't know anybody around here. (laughs) Hmm. So I'm just looking for somebody to hang out with. I didn't mean any harm. You just seem like a good guy. How about we go see a movie sometime? - Okay! - Yeah? - Okay. Okay. - Julian, can we please get the fuck out of here?! - You're friends with the ashtray miner? And you're stealing drinks too? - What did you just say to me, huh? You see this drink? It's my drink! I brought it from home. I don't steal fuckin' drinks, bud! (Sonny into walkie talkie): Yeah, Tony, pool room, please. - What kind of accusations? We don't steal drinks, thank you very much. - Bubbles, what the fuck is going on? - I got caught stealing drinks. - Listen, you tell your little door pansies to let go of my friends and we'll leave like gentlemen. - Yeah. Okay, let 'em go. You heard me, let 'em go. - Thanks, Sonny. Good times. (door clanks open) - We need to make some money. - I know. I promised Lucy I can't work for you. - Ricky, if you want Lucy back, you gotta start growing dope again, and you're gonna need lights, tables, fertilizer. - Yup. That's why I'm doing the big dirty. - No, you'll start stealing change with me tomorrow, Rick. (Bubbles): Ricky. Listen, I don't really want to do this either, but, I mean, I gotta get money for cat food! You know, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you were in on that with us, Ricky. You know. - Rick, I don't want to do this without you, okay? We got a great team here. Come on. - Please? Please? - All right, I'll do it. But the cock-muffin twins better be on their game. No fuckups. - We start training them tomorrow. (cats meow) - What the fuck? (cats meow) What the fuck are you guys...? Get the fuck out of my car! (radio): When you're looking for something new We've got a special friend for you (Bubbles sleepily sings along) Gives you more... - Bubbs! Our service... (radio cuts off) Bubbles, what the hell's going on with your cats? I thought they were trained. They're in my car. They pissed on my cigarettes. They're pooping in my dope. - Well, Ricky, did you notice how damp it is in here? - Yeah, this shed is fucked. - They're not digging it in here, right now. They like your car, 'cause it's dry. And, I mean, these are free-range kitties, you know that. They do as they please. - I'm sorry, Bubbs. I'm just grumpy. I mean, the cats kept me up all night, and thinking about Julian wanting to steal change from parking meters. It's embarrassing. - Well, Ricky, it's theft under a thousand, you know, and... it'll keep you from going to jail on me. - I know. You're right. And don't worry about the shed, man. We'll get it fixed up one day. - Smell him! He smells like cigarettes. - He does smell like cigarettes a bit, I guess. - Kitties aren't supposed to smell like cigarettes. They're supposed to smell like kitties. Aren't ya? (sniffs) - Sorry, Bubbs. I'm just grumpy, man. They kept me up all night fuckin' with me. - You should put a new shirt on maybe, Ricky. - Excuse me. Please tell me that's not Trinity's breakfast. That's pathetic. - Trevor made it. It's fine. - Whatever. You're lucky Lucy's still asleep. - Don't start shit with me and Lucy again, please. - I'm not starting shit with you and Lucy. I told you to leave her alone. - That's not gonna happen. - Whatever. Hey, sweetie. - Hey. - Remember you are grounded, okay? So don't leave the park, all right? - So, Trin, does Mom talk about me at all? Do you think I got a chance of getting back with her? - Yeah, if you stop working with Julian. - Are you gonna stop stealing barbecues and selling them at the flea market? - No way! That gets me money! - Okay, Trin, what we're doing here is wrong. The only reason we're doing it is 'cause you're hungry, Dad's got no money and I'm late for work. (man on intercom): Welcome to Danny and Terry's. What's popping? - Yeah, how's it going? I came through here two hours ago. I had a huge orderfor a picnic and it's all messed up. I'm missing, uh, two cheeseburgers and... - Orange pop and onion rings. - Three orfour orange pops, some onion rings. I got kids crying back at this picnic. Mothers are pissed off at me and it's yourfault. I gotta get this food fast. So, please. I don't want to get the manager involved, but I will. - I'm terribly sorry, sir. Please drive through. (car rumbles) - Trin. You gotta quit smoking, I'm serious. I was reading these word papers in jail and it's really bad for ya. Come on, we'll both go on the patch again together. You can do it. - I guess if you'll do it with me again, I guess I could try. - Hey, that's all I'm asking. Hand over the cigarettes. I'm gonna need your lighter from you, too. And a couple of bucks for gas, if you got it. (sighs) Awesome. Thanks, sweetie. You guys really gotta get your shit together in there. - Fuck! (car rumbles) - Hey, Jim. - Barb. - I have a little question for you. You wouldn't know why the lot fees have been dwindling over the last two months, would you? - Barb likes to power trip on me all the time. We were married once. She actually, uh, made me supervisor here at Sunnyvale. She doesn't like when the lot fees don't come in on time. She doesn't like that I have a little problem with alcohol. And she sure doesn't like Randy. - Can you and Randy handle taking care of this park, or should I get somebody who can? - Barb! - I want the lot fees collected, deposited, and if somebody is three months behind and doesn't pay, I want them out! Good? Good! - Look, I'm working on it. Sunnyvale is the most important thing in my life. You know that. - You sure it's not getting drunk and walking around the park with the Hamburglar? For God's sake, Jim, get it together! - What time is it, Bubbs? - He's a couple minutes late, Julian. He'll be here, though. - He'll show up. - All right, Cory and Trevor, do not attract attention. (tires screech loudly) (exasperated sighs) (Ricky): Hey, Julian. (garbage clatters) Well, I can't believe I fuckin' agreed to this, but let's go steal your little bits of change. (Trevor mumbles) - No talking! Get over there! (Bubbles hums deliberately) (Ricky): Julian, you waiting for more people to put money in these things orwhat? Come on! - Let's do it. Let's do it. - Julian! These are the wrong size. You even check the screwdrivers? They don't fit! - Would you stop trying to ruin this for everyone and concentrate, please? - Completely different mechanism than what we trained on. - Fuckin' tools are greasy. Great! Cory, give me you're fuckin' shirt. Let's go. - It's a bit of a fuckup here, Julian. What are we gonna do? (ice cubes clink in glass) - Shut it down. Shut it down. - Shut it down? - Shut it down. - Julian, that's probably a good idea. We should rethink this, get some better tools. - All right, we'll get better tools, come back tomorrow. No big deal. - I'll show you better tools. Hold these, Bubbs. I'm taking over this job. - Ricky. (Bubbles): What's he mean, better tools? (car starts up) - Listen, I said shut it down. - I'm finishing what you started, Julian - stealing change. (tires screech) - Boys, look out! (bang, crash, clank) (loud bang) - Everybody, calm down! Nothing to see here! Just doing some accident testing for the city! Cory, Trevor, meters in the trunk. Come on! (bang trunk) - You got it! (Ricky): Basically, we're just testing to see the strength of the metal against cars, and these two guys are just gonna load them up now. (fabric rips) Everything went great. (pained groans from crowd) (Ricky): Oh-my-fuck! - Cory, cover your package up! People are eating and your bird's out! - If this what you want to do - steal change with fuck-biscuit and the naked dummy - go ahead. I got better things to do. I'm gonna find the big dirty. I'm doing it by myself. - Thanks for the shirt, dude. - Any time, man. (Ricky): Cory, get your ass off my car! (lawnmower rumbles) (engine gears down) - Randy, I want to talk to you in the office for a minute, boy. (over radio): - Mr. Lahey, you're breaking up, over. - Randy, I want to talk to you in the office for a bit, over!! - Mr. Lahey, what's up with the abrupt Randy? - Randy. - Mr. Lahey! - Randy. - Mr. Lahey! - Randy! - Fuck... - Randy! All we need is a new receipt logbook that says Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles's lot fees are unpaid. - What are you talking about, Mr. Lahey? The guys have paid their lot fees. - Randy! - Where'd all the money go? - Where did your George Foreman grill come from, Ran? All I'm saying is if they want to engage in a little shit-war, we're gonna win. This little technicality is our secret shit-weapon. It'll be like a... ...like an intermediate-range surface-to-air nuclear-shit-missile. (car horn honks) (Julian): Hey, Wanda. - Whoa, nice! Can I drive it? - Sure. (door slams shut) (Julian's door bangs) Cory and Trevorwere supposed to fix this for me. (bangs door) - Who's Cory and Trevor? - They're my assistants. - You have assistants? - Yeah. Two for "The Dark Canuck." (cash register beeps, change clatters) - I have bills. - I've gotta get rid of this change anyway. Sorry. (Wanda): Don't be sorry. (ice cubes clink in glass, stall door slams) So I hear you done a little time. - Who told you that? - Lucy told me. - Don't listen to her. (Wanda): I have a little confession to make. (Julian): What? - I've been in jail, too. Usually, guys, I tell them I've been in jail and they get all weird. - No way. - So now I only date guys that have been in jail, 'cause those are only ones who can relate. - Well, I don't wanna brag or anything, but I've been in jail a few times. Jail's a part of life. What's the big deal? - It's not a big deal. - It's kind of fun. - I think it's fun. Want to see the new bra I got yesterday? - That's... Where'd you get that? - I stole it. (Julian): That's nice fabric. - Why are you nervous? - I'm not nervous. - Yeah, you're all boob nervous. - I'm not boob nervous. I'm just... (knock at door) (usher): I know there's a man in there. I'm calling mall security. You better come out now! - All right, you got us. What's up? - You guys can't be doing that in here. - Finish it off, bud. (Wanda): Do you want popcom? I'm gonna get, um, oh, I'm gettin' nachos, with cheese and a hotdog, some chocolate-covered raisins. Do you like raisins? Julian? - Hmm? What? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just thinking about work and stuff. (Bubbles): Ow! (grunts with effort) I almost got it, Ricky! Help me! - Hold it there for a second. I'll get it. - Not like that! Jesus Murphy! (loud banging) Oh, my God! - See? - Ricky! (nervous laugh) Julian, we got one open! (Julian): Guess what, boys? I've got some good news. Ricky, I've been thinking about the big dirty lately. - You've been thinking about the big dirty? - And I think I've found it. I was at the movie theatre, and they've got this kick-ass coin machine filled with twonies and loonies. And check this out: Two hours of the day, there's only one person working. This is perfect, boys! - So you stole my idea. I'm Mr. Big Dirty, Julian, not you. Ricky, it's a combination of both ideas. It's still about change and still untraceable. What do you say, Bubbs? You in? - I don't know, Julian. I mean, would I make enough to fix up my shed and get a bit of cat food going? - You'll have enough cat food for 10 years. This is the big-time, boys. (go-cart putters) (plastic crackles) - Oh, my God! Jesus Murphy! Cocksucker! (car rumbles) (plastic crackles) (car doors slam) - Mr. Lahey, not the liquor! - Chill, Randy, I know what I'm doing. Bubbles, what's the plastic for? - I'm trying to fix my roof. It's leaking. - What's all this, uh, paraphemalia here? - It's for the "Supercats" cat show. I do that every year. You know that. (kitten purrs) - Where's Ricky and Julian? - None of your business, actually. When are you expecting your baby, Randy? (Mr. Lahey): Bubbles, when your little shit-pals get back, here's something you can tell 'em: Tell them you received official notice today that this shit-shack... (crack) ...has been officially condemned... by the power and authority invested in me by the Trailer Park SupervisorsAct. I am officially condemning this shed. - What?! You can't do that, Mr. Lahey! That's all I have for me and my kitties! - Shit-clock's ticking, Bubbs, for you, your shit-rats, and your shit-turd friends! (upset sigh) (to himself) - Crazy drunk bastard. - What? - Nothin'. - What did you say, Bubbles? - I didn't say anything. - Hope they don't shit on you, Bubbles. - Shit on me? Who? - Shit-hawks. Big, dirty shit-hawks. They're coming, Bubbles. They're flying in low. They're swooping down, shitting on people, and dragging them off to the big shit-nest. (liquor sloshes) (bottle clanks and shatters) (door slams) (car putters away) (Bubbles): I'm worried about Lahey, boys. He's threatened me and he's back on the liquor and he's got that crazy look in his eye again. He's gonna do something, I'm telling ya! - Bubbles, Lahey is a drunk trailer-park supervisor and Randy's a drunk cheeseburger eater. Fuck them! Just tell them to fuck off! - Well, I do, Ricky, but it doesn't work like when you do it. I just need you to help me with my shed. Now, come on. - We can't tonight. We're going to the strip club. - Ricky, maybe I'd like to go to a strip club too, you know, and get my drink on and look at fly hos, but I can't. I gotta work on this shit! (Ricky): Bubbles, we're not staying there. We're coming back here. There's a huge party at J-Roc's tonight! - I've known J-Roc and Tyrone since probably grade six or seven; we used to be in the chess club together. Then they got into like, heavy-metal music, grunge music, then they both became MCs. - Check one, two. - Three, four, check. - Check, check, T. J-Roc and T. - And he also makes movies. I don't know if you knew that, but he makes grease movies that he sells at convenience stores and gas stations. Dirty, greasy stuff. Like you can imagine what's going on in them. Dirty stuff. (Tragically Hip's "Scared" plays) I can make you scared If you want me to I'm not prepared But if I have to I said I could make you scared It's kind of what I do If you're prepared Here's what I propose to do... - Lucy... ...may I please have this lap dance? - Phil, honey, can you go get me a drink and I'll owe you half a lap dance? - Sure. - Thanks. Ricky, what are you doing here? I told you not to come visit me at work. Just wait for me outside, I'll be out in a second. I don't want you to see this shit. I'm working. - Lucy, I don't care about lap dancing. It's cool. You're good at it. Remember how it used to be? When I was growing dope, you had your hair salon going. You used to cook for me and Trin all the time. Remember how perfect that was? - Well, yeah, those were the good old days. - I needed to come visit you, 'cause... I want to talk to you about something very important later. - VIP pass right now. This is the fuckin' "Very lmportant Personnel room." It's not the "unemployed, just-got-out-of-jail dumb room." - Very funny. Take it easy. I got lots of money tonight. - Yeah? Well, my girlfriend doesn't give lap dances to dirty trailer-park trash. We clear on that, dick-chops? - Girlfriend? You banged Lucy? - 28 times. - Lucy, you bang this dick? - Well, yeah, but, you know, you were gone for, like, 18 months. What do you want me to do? I mean... - Lucy, I know I was in jail and you have needs, but this idiot? I thought about you nonstop when I was in jail - you and Trin. I can't believe this. I'm sorry. Like, I really fucked us up by going to jail, didn't I? Good luck, I guess. - Get the fuck out of my club! What do you need? - You're lucky I don't want to go back to jail. Ricky's really trying hard here, Lucy. - Yeah, he's clearly trying. - Listen, he was throwing a party tonight! That's what he was going on about, a party? - Yeah. - Oh, man, I gotta go find him. - I can't believe you banged that Sonny guy 28 times! It was 10 or 15 times max! - Pfft! - Don't pfft me. Fuckin' I gotta go. I gotta get a cab. (shoes clank on stairs) - Do you wanna come to a party tonight? - Yes! (excited gasps) I have to go change first. - Okay. - You can drive my car! I just picked it up. (music blaring, people talking) (Cory): Hey, man, what's up, dude? Yeah! Bubbles, what's up, man? (J-Roc rapping to the beat): Yeah how many times have you sat out the deck Gettin' wrecked and when you collect a check Knowin' that's as good as life is ever gonna get Know when you fuck a park It's in your blood your sweat Dat's some doubts and dat's some bouts of insanity... ...Stole a diamond ring to make my girl my wife You're a wife wife... That's trailer park life (muted party music) (car purrs to stop) - So this is where you grew up? - Yeah, this is home. What do you think? - It's gorgeous! - Want a drink? - Yeah. (irate neighbour): Forfuck sakes! Fuck off with the fireworks! (April Wine's "I'm On Fire For You Baby" begins) This empty space I've held so long... (Darren voiceover):"Ricky, you're the best captain we ever had. Can't wait till you get arrested again. Darren. Hard as fuck." And now I see the way it's done I thought we'd led a life before Who we were well I'm not sure But one thing I know is right I loved you then I'm going to love you tonight I'm on fire for you baby Fire for you woman All night I'm on fire for you baby Fire for you woman All night So don't take your time it's getting late We might lose if we hesitate 'Cause being free is lots of fun... - Ricky, I don't love Sonny. - I don't love him either. I think he's a fuckin' dick! - No, I mean... I love you. - Really? - Yeah. - Lucy, I know I fucked us up. I mean, what kind of boyfriend can I be in jail? I'm sorry. I mean, it's cool you're banging Sonny. I mean, it's no big deal. It was my fault. - And it was like five times, right? Max. It doesn't matter. It's totally done. - It's so good to hear you say that. I really thought it was 28 times. I knew the fucker was lying. (dog growls and whines) You want some pizza? I got some cookin'. With all the time spent on trying Then to lose your loving... Smooth. That's Moroccan Blond hash. (soft laugh) It's pretty mild, but it's good. Do you want to get drunk with me tonight? Hang out here for a bit and head over to the party? - Sure. - How many cigarettes you got, Luce? - I got a deck. - Fuck. We're gonna have to get some cigarettes tonight. So come on girl we'll raise the sky We'll break on through we'll get so high And don't worry about tomorrow's world... (heavy pounding rap song plays) - Just a sec. Hold on. - What? - I'm into something serious right now, something real heavy. There's a chance I could be going to jail. Just thought I'd tell ya so you don't fall for me, okay? - Well, what makes you think I wouldn't wait for you if you went back to jail, huh? Jail's no big deal, remember? (music pounds) (party chatter) - Look at that, Ran. Check that out. He's got a broken rearwindow. Probably hot. Get the licence number and we'll call it in, buddy. - Right now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce all y'all to the two stars of "Fire Hoes"! Give it up, y'all, for Galaxy and Dazzle. (cheering wildly) And I'm pleased to announce tonight that we in development on my new film, "Spaghetti Hoes." We also working on "Ida-hoes." Know what I'm saying? And "Cheeri-hoes." So look out for all those. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying, saying, s-saying? (Ricky): Hey. T, can I borrow the microphone for a second? (glass clanks on rail) How's everybody doin'? (cheering) - Whoo! - Things are finally starting to come togetherfor me and it's all because of one woman. Awoman that's been really cool with me being in and out of jail since I was nine years old; cool with me growing dope when I was in grade seven until now. Cool with me smoking dope, getting drunk with my friends, playing video games with my friends. I mean, I live in a car. That's why I want you all here to see me proposal her. Lucy? I want to ask for your hand in about marriage. What do you say, Lucy? Will you marry me? - Well, there's (burps) You know, there's a condition, right? Like... you've gotta promise you don't go back to jail. And if... you promise that, then... all right, then, yeah, fuck it, I'll marry you. (cheering wildly) - I promise that I don't think I'm ever going back to jail. - Cheers to Ricky and Lucy. - Show us your tits!! Show us the tits, Lucy! Come on, feature dancer! You can do it! - You want to see my tits?! (cheering) - Oh, Lucy, what are you doing? - Uh-oh, don't do it, Lucy. - Yeah, fuck it, here you go! (screaming and cheering) - You look great, honey! (man): Woo-hoo! (screaming) - Those are big, Mr. Lahey. - Unbelievable, Ran. - What a greasy whore show. - Hope you're fuckin' happy with yourself. You know, everybody saw Lucy's tits tonight. - A couple of people saw 'em, Sarah, and everybody loves tits. What's the big deal? - That's not the point, Ricky. It's embarrassing. - Lucy, I had a great night, okay? Drink some water. I'm gonna sleep in the car so I don't wake you. - Yeah. - I can't wait to get married. Sarah, you got any rolling papers? - I think your shirt's looking good tonight, Ricky. - Lucy, I'm getting fucked up tonight. I'll see you tomorrow around 12:00, 1:00? (stapler clicks) - All the kitties are out, Mr. Lahey. Boy, they're cute! - Randy. (tires squeak) - Mr. Lahey, you're in reverse! (childish voice) - Gna, gna, gna, gna, gna, gna. (huge crash) (crunching sounds) These shit-buckets will follow my rules, Randy. (cats meow pitifully) (Bubbles): I'd like to order some orange juice, please. Oh, apple juice would be wonderful. (cats meow) (glass shatters) (Bubbles grunts) - What's your friend doing? (Julian): Bubbs, don't you move! (cats meow) - I've lived in that fucking shed since I was six years old and... and it didn't just fall down on it's own! It got smashed down by a fuckin' drunk shit-hustler! Fuckin' shit-twister and that big, dirty, onion-ring bastard, Randy! (wild animal grunts) (Julian): Bubbles! Hand over the numchucks! - No way, Julian! - This is not the way to deal with this! Cory, Trevor, get over here and give me a hand! Grab his legs! - Don't grab my legs. - All right, calm down. Calm down, count to 10. Everything's gonna be cool. - Trevor? Let go of my leg! - Good afternoon, gentleman. It is my pleasure to inform you that you have 30 days to quit the environs of Sunnyvale Trailer Park for just cause of non-payment of lot fees. Adios, amigos. - Give me that. - What the fuck are you talking about? We paid our money. I live in a fuckin' car, Lahey! - Oh, yeah? - We're not goin' anywhere. - Keep your hands to yourself. - No, and the only thing you're evicting is the fuckin' cheeseburgers that are Randy's gut! (Randy): Frig you, Rick. (Ricky): Yeah? Frig me, Randy? - Don't push me! - You want to fuckin' go? 'Cause I've been waitin' to fight you for a long fuckin' time! (grappling sounds) (Randy belches) Aw! Fuck! The smell of cheeseburgers! - Why did you knock my shed down?! - Bubbles, that is a dangerous... dangerous weapon! (Bubbles growls) - You fight dirty, Ricky! - You like that? - I'll fucking unload one on ya! - Fucker. Hey, Lahey! Guess what? (over radio) Randy's leaking cheeseburger! Listen! (loud belch) You fuckin' like that?! - I don't like it at all, Rick! - Bubbles... - Let's go, Lahey! (siren blares) - Boys, cops! (Lahey): It's a dangerous weapon! (Randy belches loudly) (Ricky): Oh, my fuck! (cop): That's enough! Break it up! Jim? - Barb, will you tell Officer Pineapple-Cock and fucky-the-drunk-clown here we're all paid up! - Well, I wish I could, Rick, but according to Randy's neatly kept records, you're all three months over. - We paid our lot fees, Barb! This is bullshit! - No, it's not. (Barb): Look! - You guys are gone. Evicted, all of you. - Well, what about what that drunk bastard did to my shed? - Let's talk about drunk trailer-park supervisors getting drunk as fuck, ruining peoples' lives! - Maybe I should look into how your daughter's stealing barbecues and selling them at the flea market. Eh, Rick? Would you like that? Don't mess with me, Rick. (Julian): Come on, Bubbs. - Thirty days, boys. Thirty sexy days, Julian. Sexy. - You're gonna pay for this. - Hey, Rick, knock-knock. - Who's there? - Aloser, Rick. Guess what losers do, Ricky? They lose. (dish slams on counter) (beer bottles crash) - There's no mustard. - No bologna sandwiches either, Julian. Like, what are we going to do here? I mean, we paid our lot fees. Lahey and Randy told a fib to Barb and... I mean, that's it. We're done here, Julian. There's no hope. - Wait, wait, wait. I've got an idea, Bubbs. Bubbs, look at me. - No. - Bubbles, look at me. - No! - Look at me, please! (growls) - All we've gotta do is the big dirty, today. - Do you think that's a good idea, Julian, doin' another massive robbery? - Bubbs, if we do this, we'll be able to pay the lot fees directly to Barb this time. It's gonna be easy, man! - All right, Julian. Let's do it, then. Let's do the big dirty. - Hey, Bubbs, don't be throwing sandwiches around the trailer again, man. Come on. - Sorry, Julian. (water sloshes) (powder sifts) (water sloshes) - Lahey's right. I'm a loser. - No. - We're gonna deal with this Lahey bullshit later, I promise. But the big dirty's happening now and we need you, Rick. It's a five-man job. Come on, you're my wingman. Alot of planning went into this, Ricky. - I lost my credulence, boys. I don't think I got what it takes. I can't do it. No offence, guys, but... I think I'm as stupid as you guys are. - No way, Ricky. You're the coolest guy in the park, and the smartest. Me and Cory have always looked up to you. And if you lose your... credulence, where does that leave us? 'Cause without you it's like we don't have a dad or a big brother or somethin'. We love you, Ricky! - For real, dude. Sometimes me and Trevor pretend we're you. - Don't go tellin' 'em that. - Boys... you guys pretend you're Ricky? - Yeah, it's the only time we feel cool. - You guys really pretend that you're me? - Yeah. (click) - Come on, Ricky. - Come on, Ricky. (car rumbles by) (doors bang) - Two for "Freak Turbulence." - Come on, Bubbles, keep it together. This is the big dirty! (rock music begins) - Ricky's on line. - Bubble's on line. - Julian on line. - Cory on line. - Trevor on line. - Let's do the big dirty! - All right, you fuckin' idiots! Clear the fuck out! Don't nobody get stupid! - What do you want, man? - No talking! (spritz) - Cory, Trevor, confidence check. - Confidence 100 percent. - At about 70 percent, Julian. - Seventy percent? Trevor, bring it back up to 100! Stop fuckin' around here! - Julian, don't be too hard on 'em. Cory and Trevor, you guys rock. - Thanks a lot, Ricky. I'm at 100 percent. - Still at 100 percent. (wheels clatter) - Bubbles at position two! (nervous exhale) - Go time! (over walkie-talkie): - Cory, Trevor, you're doing good. You're doing a great job. Nice work, boys. (huge crash) (Bubbles): Come on, boys, scoop! Scoop like the wind! Scoop! Scoop! Scoop! Scoop! Scoop! - Ricky, let me help you! - What the fuck is wrong with you?! Fuck! - Come on, Trevor, scoop the fuckin' change! - Get the fuck off me, Trevor! - Aah! (fire alarm rings) - You stupid cock-tractors! (Bubbles): Oh, no, boys. There's people coming out of the theatres! Boys, what are we gonna do? - No big deal. Just a fire drill. There's nothing to see here! (boy): They're real criminals, Dad! They're robbing the change. (Ricky): What the fuck happened in there?! (Trevor): Come on, we kind of messed up here. (Ricky): It's not the first time, fuckin' Cory! What the fuck was...? - Get the popcorn bags! - What the fuck you looking at, fuckies? - Ricky, we're blocked in! - The fuck we are! - Fuck! - Darryl! (Bubbles): Boys, do you guys think that it might be a big deal that 10,000 people just saw us doing that and took pictures of us? Maybe? (trunk squeaks open) That is a lot of change to be in possession of. What about all the witnesses, Ricky? - Bubbles, the only ones they saw are Cory and Trevor. It's no big deal. - I can't believe it. We pulled it off. We pulled off the big dirty! (nervous sigh) - Where are we gonna hide it all, Julian? - We'll just leave it right in the trunk. No one's gonna think to look there. - Yeah, this seems to be the safest place. You know what you should do now, Rick? You should go spend some time with your family, buddy. You deserve it, man. - You should make some time for Trinity, Ricky. People are complaining about her stealing barbecues. She's got a new one every day. That's greasy! - It's not that greasy. Boys, come on, give me a hug here. We did it, guys. We fuckin' did it! - What did I tell ya? You steal change, you don't go to jail, boys. - I can't believe it, Julian, but you were right, man. I'll catch you guys later, okay? - Ricky, tell me you're not drinking liquor out of my cat dish. (car rumbles along) - Betterfuck off, Bobby! You better tell your dad to pay me for my dope! Hey, Trin. - Hey. - You got your patch on? - Yup. - Awesome. I got some good news. - What? - Me and mom, we're getting married. - Wow! - Isn't that awesome? - Yeah. - We gotta have a little talk, though, about you stealing barbecues and selling them at that flea market. It's gotta stop. - No way, Dad. It's my money, my living. It's not gonna happen. - It has to stop. I'm serious. I know it's easy and I'm the one that taught you to do it, but you can't need do it anymore. 'Cause I'm gonna be giving you money from now on. Look! I'll give you this whole thing if you promise me no more stealing barbecues and you'll stay on that patch. - Okay, but can I at least sell these? - Oh, yeah, you can sell these, but don't steal any more. - Okay. - And don't tell Mom I gave you this money, all right? I love you, sweetie. - Bye. - I'm gonna spend my big dirty money on my wedding. I'm gonna get a nice ring, I don't care what it costs. This is gonna be the awesomest wedding this trailer park has ever seen. The awesomest! It's all for Lucy. (Lucy): Aw, Ricky, I don't want this wedding to get all fucked up. I want it to be awesome! I want lots of music, awesome food... (Ricky): I remember the first night me and Lucy made love just like it was yesterday. We were down at Kentucky Fried Chicken, right after those new chicken strips came out, we had a bunch of those, big bucket of chicken. She asked me to come in the bathroom with her, so I did. She had booze in her purse; I had a bunch of good dope 'cause I was growing dope back then. We just sat there, smoking dope, drinking. We made love all night. It was just so beautiful, I'll never forget it. We slept right on the floor, till the cleaners came in the next morning. - And in the moming, when we kinda came to, we just sorta looked at each other and we knew, like... we're gonna be togetherforever. (Ricky):I can't believe we're getting married. Look at that cubic zarcarbium! And Trin, it's because of you that this all happening. I want you to give this to your mom when the guy asks for it at the wedding. - Okay. - Just eat it! Stop complaining! Mom?! - Trin, go get the car, bring it out front. I'll be there in a minute. - What's the matter? - Check the oil. Well, look who it fuckin' is! - Who's that? - Aw, just a jail dummy. - How's the tournament going, Donny? - Actually, Rick, uh, I'm with my family. And I don't really want to talk to you. But if you must know, your friends are gonna lose again next week and you're not gonna be playing. I'll talk to you later. - Talk to me later? What happened to "Fight me any time, anyplace," ya scaredy-cheater? - Rick, I'm having Chinese food with my family, okay? My wife, my kids, my grandmother. Show a little respect, Ricky. Please. Okay? I tell ya what, I'm gonna let you come back to jail. You can play in the tournament, but this has gotta stop. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. - You're gonna let me come back? - I'm getting tired of this. This is embarrassing. You can come back and play. This is dumb. This is getting too much. - Well, all right, Donny. That's pretty good of you. - I know. (groans) You're not playing in the ball-hockey toumament, Ricky. You're not coming back just yet to my jail. I'll tell you when you come back. - Oh, I got you, buddy. Come on. - Come on. - Dad, great sucker punch. - That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, right there. Thanks, kiddo. Come on, let's go before the cops come. Let's go, grab your purse, okay? - Aw, he got you pretty good, man. - Fuck. (horn honks) (car squeaks to stop) - God, you were suckered. Man, he suckered ya! - Did he ever. - Clear! - Thanks, sweetie. - Dad, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just fell off my chair, Trin. - Are you drunk, Dad? - No, I had two drinks today. (car screeches to a stop) (spritz) (George): Change, change, change, change. I'm so goddamn sick of it. Parking meters, vending machines, laundromats, arcades, payphones, pool tables, carwash. People think we give a shit about change? News flash: We don't. - George, calm down. Mr. Lahey, Randy. - Hi, I made some sandwiches here, guys. Got some tuna, egg salad... - Randy. Ted. - Jim, you promised me you'd stop drinking. - Let's cut to the chase here. Either of you sexy officers interested in grand theft auto? - Mr. Lahey, Ted said... - Randy. Two counts, Ted. I got licence plates, serial numbers. They're stolen, guaranteed. - Jim, we really don't care. - George. Leave us alone. - Stop fuckin' calling us! - George! Enough. - George, what do you mean you don't care? - Mr. Lahey, despite the fact that you're drunk right now, here's what I'm gonna do: We'll come over and check out the cars, but if they come back clean, which won't surprise anybody here, you're not to contact us in any way for at least two months. No phone calls, no faxes, nothing! We clear? - Crystal clear, Ted. ("Canon in D" playing) - J-Roc, check, check one, two. J-Roc, check. (Ricky): Hey, guys, get drunk! This is gonna be awesome! Everybody, drink up! (applause and cheering) - God, Julian looks sexy and nice. - What are you doing, Jim? You promised me grand theft auto. - Right here. Run that! (car purrs along) - Bet you that friggin' car's stolen! - Get a picture, Randy. (heavy-metal song starts) - We are gathered here today to witness the holy matrimony of two people, Richard and Lucy, who have chosen to prepare their own vows. - Thank you, Your Honour. Okay, everybody, here we go! I, Richard, am gonna cut back on my drinking to 3 or 4 days a week and smokin' dope to probably 5 or 6. And I'm hopefully promising you this, that I'm not gonna hopefully go back to jail. Never. I'm gonna try to love you as much as I'm capable for to love, forever and ever. And Lucy, I promise you, I'm gonna start growing dope again and get my life back on track. Amen. - Um, can you hold this for a sec? Sweet. Thanks. I, Lucy, promise to stop stripping so I can open up a hair salon, uh, to not get any more plastic surgery or tattoos, to be a good mother and wife, whenever possible, and, uh, to help out with house stuff. And to help keep Ricky happy and healthy and well... taken care of, um... for as long as he stays out of prison, forever. - Do you have the ring? - Trin? (car radio blaring) Can you just hold that for a sec? I love you, Lucy. (gasps) - Oh, my God. - I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (cheering) - We did it, Lucy. We did it! - Lucy! I need to talk to you, sweetheart. - What the hell are you doing here? It's our wedding day! (shocked murmurs) - I'm not talking to you, smart guy. - I got this Lucy, relax. - Let's go home, okay? - Okay. - What are you doin' comin' up here on my wedding day with a big fancy gun? I'll tell you what you're doing: You're showin' off. - I'm not showin' off. - Sure, you're showin' off. Here's showin', here's off, there's you. Look in the word directory - big picture of you showin' off. - I'm... (scared murmurs) - That's showin' off! That's showin' off! (coins clatter on ground) - Gunfire. All right, now we gotta move. Randy and I'll go 'round back. We'll meet you down at the wedding. - Lucy, get the fuck over here! I want my six grand! I want the fuckin' money for the tits, Lucy! - Six grand for tits? Well, I'm not paying six grand for used tits! - Ricky, they're "in-use" tits. They're not "used" tits. - Number one, I found out you only banged herfive times. So you were lying about that, which is showin' off. And since you banged her five times, you've used those tits more than I have. I've only banged her twice since I got out of jail. I'm not paying six grand for tits. I mean, those are nice, but I'm not even a big fan of fake tits. So I'm not paying for used fake tits. I liked Lucy just the way she was, thank you very much. (Lucy): Sonny, can I talk to you for a second? Come here. Just give me a second. - Let me handle this. - Ricky, we need to talk. Now! Come on. - Listen, okay, I'm really sorry that you found out about it like this, okay? We banged a couple of times, now I'm married. - Boys, we should get this car out of here, like now. - I was gonna make you a feature dancer. You could've had it all. - I don't want to be a feature dancer. - Okay. - This is what I want. So... can you live with that? - We're cool. We're good. - We're cool? We're good? We're good. Okay, thanks. - Those are club boots. I need 'em back, Luce. (siren blares) - Cops! Cops! (siren blares) (whimpers) Ricky, the cops are here... I'm starting to lose it maybe. - Everybody stay right where they are. - Jim. - In cooperation with... - Jim. ...local police department- - Mr. Lahey, please! - Ted, Mr. Lahey's just trying to help... - Randy. - We'll handle this. All right, who fired shots? - Nobody, huh? - Cherry Heranjek, right? Wanted in two states? There's a Canada-wide warrant for your arrest? Sound about right? - What? No, I'm Wanda. I'm a feature dancer. - Of course you are. - I am. - You're under arrest. - No, excuse me. - Yes, here's your rights. - No. I'm sorry, Julian. I guess it's overfor a little while. I guess I'll see you around in a couple of years, maybe? Jail's no big deal, right? - Jail's no big deal. - Aw. I love you, Julian! Call me! Oh, um, Officers, before we go, you might want to check this guy's pockets for, I don't know, a handgun! Ha! Ha! Ha! Fucker. - All right, open it up. And that's not yours, right? (laughs nervously) - It's not mine. But we can work this out. I got all my papers. - And these aren't my cuffs. Turn around. You're busted. - Ah, you know what, guys... - Yeah, yeah. - We can talk about it downtown. (coins clatter on ground) - Change? - Oh, he's gonna tell on us! We gotta get this car out of here! - Okay, hurry. Get the car out of here, okay? - George! George, George, George! They're the ones stealing the change, George! They're... We'll take the shortcut and we'll head 'em off. Don't you shit-worms move! (Ricky): Fuck you, Lahey! (Bubbles): Oh, my God! - Drunk bastard. It's okay, boys! (Bubbles): Come on, Ricky! - What the hell is he doing?! (Julian): Just go to the back entrance. (Bubbles): Ricky, get us out of here! - You ready for a little game of shit-chicken, scooter Randy? (car rumbles) - Ricky, the cops are behind us! (tires squeal) What are we gonna do?! (car revs) - Just give me a second to think about this. (Bubbles): Ricky! (tires screech) - Do you want to take it to fucktown, Lahey? 'Cause that's where this is headed - downtown fucktown! - No, Mr. Lahey, please! We don't want to go to fucktown! (whimpers) (cars roar and squeal) - Guess you lose, fuckhead! - Ricky! (screeching, loud crash) (Ricky): Ah, fuck!!! (Julian): Fuck sakes, Rick!! (change clinks) - You okay, Randy? - Mr. Lahey, we're upside down. We flipped the car. - Yeah, that was really something, wasn't it? And so with the able assistance of Officers Green and Johnson, we solved the crime and made the arrest. - Well, thank you, Mr Lahey. You and Randy may step down now. Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown?! - Oh, me? Ahem. Your Honour, we ask for leniency in the court's decision. These boys have no education. They're addicted to drugs and alcohol and they live in a trailer park. - Why the fuck would you say that? What the fuck does that supposed to mean? - I'm warning you, one more outburst and I'll find you in contempt of court. - Your Majesty, I'm sorry, but obviously Miss Brown here is a little bit fucked in the head. I mean, she's looking at these coupons for... "Danny and Terry's Buffalo Heaven" trying to figure out what she wants for lunch. What the hell is that? She doesn't care about us. If this suit-dummy here doesn't mind, I'd like to have two minutes of the court's time to say a couple things. Just two minutes. Please. - Your Honour, we can't waste the court's time with this. - Two minutes, that's it! - Your Honour! - I'm... I'm gonna grant it. I mean, what harm can it do, Mr. Stevenson? You've got this thing sewn up, right? You go ahead, Ricky. - Thanks, bud. The first thing is this - this stupid picture. If I could get Cory and Trevor to rise there for a second. I mean, obviously, well, you can see that that's Cory and this is Trevor. I don't know who that guy is, you can't see him, and you can't see that person either. So there's only two people in the picture. It looks like maybe they are stealing change, which I don't agree with, but I had nothing to do with this. This is not the change they recovered from my car. Totally different. That's the change I was saving for my daughter's education. So the second thing... is this: Really, the only evidence against us is Mr. Lahey's testimony. And if his testimony is so goddamn important, then I want to hook him up to a breathalyser. He should clearly show he's not drunk as fuck, 'cause I think he is. And if he is, shouldn't his testimony mean fuck all? Shouldn't this case be thrown out of court? Shouldn't I be given my change back? I'm in deservement of the change. I want the change back! It's not my fault Officers Cock-Knuckles and Dick-Lock here work with a drunk trailer-park supervisor. He's not a cop, he's a drunk! - They are not Officers Cock-Knuckles and Dick-Lock. They are Officers Green and Johnson. Now I warned you about this kind of thing! - He used to be a cop, actually, and he got fired. Guess what for? Drinking! Who does he work with? Randy, who used to be a male prostitute. You got no problem with being hooked up with a breathalyser, do you, Lahey? I mean, you shouldn't be drunk. You drove here today. - Oh, smart, Ricky, smart. - Bailiff, do we have a breathalyser machine in the building? - Yes. - Well, let's get it in here and find out who's drunk and who's not! (Bubbles whispers to himself): Come on, come on. Come on, liquor! Come on, liquor! (Ricky whispers to himself): Come on, you're drunk. You gotta be drunk. You're always drunk, you drunk. Come on, you're drunk. You've got to be drunk. (loud beeping) - The witness is intoxicated, Your Honour. (wild cheering) - I knew he was wasted! I knew it. (Bubbles): He's loaded! (Judge): Well, in light of this new evidence, I have no choice but to drop the charges against Ricky, Julian and Bubbles. (happy murmurs) Order, please! And because there's no proof that the money came from an illegal source, I order that their change be given back to them. - Thank you. It is my change. Thank you. - Cory and Trevor, please rise. I sentence you to 30 days in jail and 750 hours of community service. - That's not that bad, guys. That's pretty good. Hear that, Lahey? You never stopped fuckin' with me, huh? You couldn't let it go and look what happened? You look like a dick. (Judge): Rick, get it together. Do you want to spend a week in jail effective immediately? - Did you say a week? - Would you rather have two? - No, no, a week's good. Just... Lucy, Trin, can I please go to jail for a week, play in the hockey game? Please? It's only a week. - Have fun. - Yeah. - Really? Cover your ears, sweetie. Fuck this court. Fuck Jim Lahey. Fuck Randy. Fuck those two idiot cops. Fuck suit-dummies. As a matter of fact, fuck legal aid! Fuck Dan and Terry's Buffalo chicken wings! Fuck all the old wood in here, the moon, corn on the cob, squirrels. Fuck me, you, everything! (slapshot) Give it off to Darren! Come on, Darren! It was just so great to come back to play in the final game of the tournament. I missed lots of games, but I played in the big one. If you see 'em, feed 'em, boys. We gotta score the winning goal. Hard as fuck, boys. (Guys): Hard as fuck! (Ricky): Don't take any shit off these dicks. (Trevor): It wasn't looking good for them... And we're huge Ricky fans and he's an incredible goalie, and, you know, he can stop just about anything, but the team wasn't playing as a team. They weren't playing good. The turning point, for me, was when Donny came down on a breakaway and I was sure they were gonna win. And Ricky just threw the glove up and stopped it. And then, somehow, it started going the other way, and Darren, on a breakaway, faked a slapshot, just went around him, deeked it right in, and they won! (cheering wildly) (Cory): It was insane, dude. And in all the hoopla, we were, like, this is our big chance to make something of ourselves. - But the best part was Cory and Trevor. They snuck up behind Donny - he wasn't looking - and they pantsed him in front of the whole prison. Rolling around on the ground in puddles. Oh, my God, it was funny. Those guys finally came out of their shell and they're cool, like everybody in here loves them now. So I get to leave here a married man. And I'm retired, so all I have to do now is spend time with my family and grow dope. My life couldn't be any better.
