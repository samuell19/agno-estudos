Sweetheart, could you get the light, please? Teddy… look what I found. Sweetheart, I'm sorry, but I have to take out a gall bladder first thing in the morning. - Tomorrow night. I promise. - No, I won't be here tomorrow night. - I'll be at the nail expo. - What? The cuticle convention, remember? I'll be gone till Monday. Oh, well, Monday, then. I promise.

Those guys? - Yeah. - A band. - Boy, I'm totally clear. - ZEEBO: What's up, Doc? - You mean like a rock 'n' roll band? What are you doing with a band, Val? I won them on MTV. I won an MTV weekend with a band. Hi. I am, uh, Mac. How is it hanging, Mr. Dude? - Dr. Dude. - Dr. Dude. Oh, no, Val. Wait a minute. Listen, I came home to talk to you alone. I'm sorry, fellas. This is private. - I'm sure you won't mind when I ask you to leave. - Oh, leave? No, no. They can't leave. They're spending the weekend. No, no, Val. They can't spend the weekend. - This is my house. I say they're out of here. - Your house? Wait, wait, wait. I think I threw you out, Dr. Love. Oh, yeah? Well, now I'm gonna throw them out. - So what about that? - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. They're out of… - No… - I won them. I get to… - What? - You're tearing me apart! - Val, these guys are too weird. - You have no business being with people like that. - Listen, I never won a band before and I get them for the whole weekend, so they're staying. I want you to be happy. That's fine, but… - Dr. Dude? - What is it now? - For you is good. - You animal! I oughta give you a tracheotomy. - Do you know who that was? That was Mercedes. - No, Ted, don't! My most expensive fish! Do you know how much Mercedes cost me?! - He cost me 300 bucks! - Hey, what's going on here? All right, all right. Break it up. - Hey, hey! Come on! - Break it up. - What are you doing? - Who's Dr. Gallagher? - I'm Dr. Gallagher. - Uh-huh. I'm Officer Demonte. This is Officer Murphy. You reported a break-in and possible kidnapping? Yes, I did, officer, but, thank God, she's here now and she's fine. However, these degenerates broke into my home and destroyed my property and I want them arrested right now. - They're MTV scum! - All right. Ma'am, you mind telling us what's really going on here? Officer, sir, this man does not live here anymore, and he's strangling my guests. - He was eating my Blue-Gilled Dorky. - Hey, watch your mouth! 10-13. We got a false report. Just a domestic dispute. His girlfriend dumped him for a rock band. - That's bullshit! - Hey, buddy. Maybe you need to go someplace and cool off, huh? Let go of me! I'm a doctor! Good, if we have to bust your arm, you can put on your own cast. You're right, Val. There is a lot I don't know about you, but if you thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with you and your weird friends and that psychotic cat of yours, you're crazy! - The wedding's off, Val! - Come on, buddy. ZEEBO: You wanna dance with a zero? I'm sorry. I think I have to go to my room now. Is Ted coming back? No. Ted doesn't wanna come back. I don't know what Ted wants, but it's not me. What does Valerie want? I don't know. I just wanna be happy. Mac could make Valerie happy. Thanks, but I don't think anybody could make me feel very good right now. Mac could make Valerie feel very, very good. Wait a minute. Are you, like, coming on to me? Is this a pass? Because, I mean, if it is, sex is, like, totally out of the question. What is sex? Sex… you know, making love. A man and a woman like each other, and they take their clothes off, and… - Okay. - Well, no, no, no! We can't. No, because, I mean, me and Ted are, uh… well, I guess we're not, but, I mean, uh… we can't because, I mean, you're an alien, and I'm from the valley. We may not even be, you know, anatomically correct for each other. That could be a real problem. No problem. But, I mean, uh, no, no, no. I mean, it just wouldn't work. You're from out of town. The phone bills would just be hell… Shh. Well, I just don't want you to think - Earth girls are easy. - What is easy? This is easy. - Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - I told you not to have fun. - I wasn't. Help! Ted! Help! Uh-oh. Uh, don't go anywhere. I've been paged. - Oh, sweetheart. - Ted. - Ted, make it stop. - Oh, hey. Ted. What happened to my fish? Ted! Beemer! Your face! What happened? Don't! Stop it, stop it! Hi. Hi. God, I had the weirdest dream last night. - All I remember is… - Shh. You have the strangest heartbeat. Sounds like you have two hearts. Yes. Don't you? No, I just have one. Tell me about Zimbabwe. - Jhazalla? - Jhazalla. Is it like Earth? Yes. It's beautiful. Sounds neat. - Is driving a UFO a good job? - Oh, yes. - Do you own your own home or do you rent? No water. Come look. Hi, guys. Hope instant decaf is okay. Breakfast is on the way. I'm making pancakes from scratch. Yeah. Valerie, uh… we can go home now. Oh. Gee… that's great. Wow. I didn't think it would be so soon. Yeah. That's, uh, that's really good. Yeah. Uh, Valerie… - - Well, I better go get that. WOODY: Pool man! Hey, dudes, what's happening? - Woody. - Woody. What is this? - A spaceship? - Spaceship? - No way, Jose, Woody. - No. - What is it, then? - A car. Oh! That's why she wanted me to drain it. She drove her car into the pool. I'm always doing that. Pretty rad car, though. Where is it made? Finland. - Finland. - Finland. Oh, I heard of that. Ted, bringing that girl here was inexcusable, but now that I've slept on it, I could probably forgive you, but what about calling off the wedding? Sweetheart, I didn't mean that. Marrying you is the most important thing in the world right now. I need you to take care of me. And I promise, I won't so much as look at another woman, so long as I live. Well, unless, of course, I'm giving her a physical examination. Well, I hope not. A relationship is a lot like a porcelain nail, Ted. You can break it and you can glue it back together, but it's not gonna be as strong as it was unless the person is really committed and not bringing home nurses. Whoa, you should've seen me today, man. Nothing but radical rips all the way in. You want some slushy? Yeah, I was barely off my board and the wahines are all over me. Ew! Wahines! Wahines. You know, girls. - Girls? - You know girls? Does the Woodburger know girls? Pinocchio got a wooden butt? I could fix you up with some bodacious chicks just like that. - Don't believe me? - Like that. Come on. Let's hit the beach. Ride the wild bikinis! - We go get Candy? - Yeah. Candy, gum, beer nuts, anything you want. Twizzlers. I got some Milk Duds. You oughta lay off coffee, though, man. It'll kill you in a day. I know where I'm gonna take you. I'm gonna take you to Zuma Beach. I need surprises. I need romance. I mean, how long has it been since you said I love you, I need you, I'm crazy about you? Well, Ted? Get in the car, will you? Wiploc. Zeebo. Zeebo going to Zuma Beach! Zeebo! Wiploc! Hey, dudes. I just remembered something. What was it? Oh, yeah. At the beach today, - they're having a blond-of-the-month contest. - Blond? Yeah, you know, blonde beach bunnies.

TED: You know, I thought a lot about what you said and I've decided to do something impulsive. Let's go to Vegas tonight and get married. Tonight? Well, wait a minute. What about the church and my dress and everything? We can do the big church wedding later. Just like you planned. Well… what do you say? Well, I don't know. I'm just so surprised. Come on. You wanted surprises. Ted. You gotta bring that one-piece night thing, that, uh, corset that looks like underwear. What is it now? Something old… oh! These pantyhose are old. Something new. This veil is new. Dr. Tushman, please. Barbara, Ted here. Listen, uh, I need a really big favor. I want you to cover my shift at the hospital tomorrow. I'm going to Vegas. Well, I'm gonna… lose a little money, take in a show, and… get married. Barbara. Barbara… Look, just because I'm getting married doesn't mean we can't date, all right? What? ZEEBO: Valerie. - Good-bye. - Bye. Nice planet you have here. Give Tonya my number. Take care, Zeebo. Aw, Wiploc. I think I'll miss you least of all. You got lip lock for Wiploc?
