(upbeat music) - Gentlemen, Dr. Arnold has arrived and would like to say a few words before we come to any decision about his proposal. - Thank you. Fellow doctors, I think you all know the great amount of time and money I've spent researching and experimenting with heart transplants. Some of us believe that this is a major breakthrough in medicine. We have at our fingertips, a way to save the lives of chronically ill patients who would've had no hope at all before. My research and knowledge have reached the point where I feel that it's entirely feasible that this operation can be completely successful when the proper precautions are taken. - What are the proper precautions, doctor? - I believe you'll find that information in my research paper that you all have. - But the paper only deals with your research on animals. - Of course. - Research on animals is a far cry from making guinea pigs of human beings. (crowd murmuring) - The facts clearly show that reasonable success is possible. - Order gentlemen, please. - Reasonable success? Do you expect us to stand behind an idea that could brand us all as medical butchers if you fail with the promise of only reasonable... - I don't expect to fail. I know it can be done. I know I'm ready. - Perhaps you think you're ready, doctor, but is the world ready? - What about the moral implications of such a move? - Your research isn't conclusive enough, Jim. - Take a few more months. Perhaps we can reconsider then. (crowd murmuring) (ominous music) - I didn't know anyone was here. - What the hell are you doing here? - I came to get a drink. - This bar is closed. - I told you my brother wasn't very hospitable. - How many times have I told you not to bring your tramps here? You want to roll in the gutter, do it somewhere else. - But I thought this was my gutter. Yours and mine, remember? - Listen, you broken down fighter, you live here because I let you, because I take care of you. - Sure, you take care of me, the big doctor. I could've been somebody once but you didn't want that, oh no. If I couldn't get through medical school, you didn't want me to be nothing. How would it look for the successful doctor to have a pug for a brother? It was better if he'd be a bum. Don't be champ, keep out of sight. (laughs) Everybody takes care of Tammy, don't they baby? Oh, I'm a little bit short of cash. Could you let me have a few? (upbeat music) - Mrs. Woodruff, I don't believe you were scheduled for an appointment today. - Hello, Miss Mills, I've come to see the doctor on a business matter. - I see. The doctor's on the phone, it'll be a few minutes. - I hope this doesn't take too long. I've had a very tiring day. - I know. It's been a long day for all of us. - Ah yes, the doctor's conference. Tell me, Miss Mills, how did the doctors receive Dr. Arnold's ideas on heart transplants, my heart transplant? Not that it's important but I imagine they won't be convinced until there has been a successful operation. And what about you? Do you have the confidence in your Dr. Arnold? - Yes, I do. Jim, Dr. Arnold is a brilliant, dedicated man. He's worked very hard to make an operation like this possible... - And he's a lucky man to have such a dedicated helper, one so young and pretty as you. Tell me Beth, what do you think of an old woman like me clinging to life by supporting research on an idea that might work? - I don't look at it that way, Mrs. Woodruff. Without you, he wouldn't have had the necessary money for the research. - That's very true, Beth. - And without him, you wouldn't have a few extra years for happiness. - Happiness? I'm afraid you don't understand my motives, Beth. I have my memories to give me happiness. No, I'm a wealthy woman Miss Mills, there are a lot of people around waiting for me to die. I am not going to give them that satisfaction just yet. - You'll have your wish, Mrs. Woodruff, very soon. - How soon, Beth? I've waited a long time for this and I expect to see results. Does he have any idea when we can get this taken care of? - It takes time, Mrs. Woodruff. - Time I don't have, I'm afraid. If I can't get something definite from him, I'll just take my money out of the foundation... - But you can't do that. I mean, Jim has all his hope pinned on this operation, we both do. He has to have this in order to get the recognition he deserves. - I didn't mean to upset you so. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Woodruff, but Jim is too important to me to see his work go down the drain. I want to be more to him than a helper. - I understand, Beth. You'll have more time for each other once this business is over. - I think he's off the phone now. I'll tell him you're here. (phone ringing) - Okay, send her in, please. - You can go right in. - Thank you. (gentle music) Good afternoon, Dr. Arnold. - Hello, Mrs. Woodruff, how have you been? Sit down, please. - Thank you. Let's get right to the point, Dr. Arnold. I've just come from my lawyer and the papers are all drawn up. As we agreed, there will be a minimal fee for the operation plus an additional $100,000 to be paid to your research foundation annually for the next 10 years. Now I've completed my part of the bargain, are you ready to fulfill yours? There isn't much time left, as you know. - I know, Mrs. Woodruff, I know. Just a few details that still have to be straightened out. - Details or problems, doctor? - Well, we have to arrange for hospital facilities. Then there's the matter of the heart itself. As I explained to you, it must be healthy. - You assured me all this could be easily taken care of once you had received the support of your colleagues. You've already done this, haven't you? - For the most part, yes. But you must realize there are always a few reactionaries who are against any new medical procedures they don't understand. It seems to take more than a few years of successful research to convince them. - Then perhaps my successful operation will. I'll be expecting to hear from you soon. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Woodruff. - At least we do understand each other, don't we? (knocking on door) - Come in. - She doesn't look well, does she? What did you tell her? - What could I tell her? - You didn't tell her that they... - No, I didn't tell her that they turned me down. God only knows why I didn't. - What good would it have done to upset her? Besides, they didn't really turn you down. They just asked for more time to consider. - Yes, that's what I like to think, time. She's a sick woman, Beth. She's pinning all her hopes for recovery on this operation. - And why not? We all know it's her only hope. - But is it? No one else seems to think so. - You're not beginning to have doubts, are you? You're too good a doctor for that. - It's not my medical capabilities I'm questioning. Beth, what if my reasons aren't as selfless as I'd like to think they are? What if it is money? - Money isn't a dirty word, Jim. You've spent too many years worrying about humanity not to get something in return. Mrs. Woodruff is getting the benefit of your efforts. It's only right that she should pay for it. I'm sorry but it's about time someone started looking out for your interests. It's your discovery and you're going to get everything you deserve for performing that operation. No arguments. Finish your work and we'll get some dinner. (upbeat music) - Hey! (woman yells) (grunting) Hey baby, you okay? Hey Joan, baby are you okay? Hey. Answer me. - Weren't they in the club? - Yeah, yeah, weren't they? I guess that's their thing. (knocking on door) - Open the door, Jim. - What the hell's going on out there? Oh my God, what have you done now? - You've got to help me. It was an accident. I swear it was an accident. - Bring her in here. - Who is it, Jim? - It's all right, Beth, nothing to worry about. (banging) There's been a small accident. - What's the meaning of this? What kind of accident? - I didn't mean to do it. You've got to help me. - Why did you bring her here? - She needs a doctor. She's still alive, isn't she? - Yes, but she's hemorrhaging badly. She's got to get to a hospital. - You can't do that, what if she dies? They saw me with her, they'd never believe that I... - Who saw you with her? - I don't know, I don't know. A girl standing in the alley. - Did she recognize you? - I don't know. She's seen me there before. It was dark in the alley. I don't know, I don't know. - He's right, we can't take any chances. - But Beth! - If this gets out, it could ruin you. (crying) Pull yourself together. We're gonna need your help, for whatever it's worth. - Prepare the patient for surgery, Beth. This is going to be a long night. (tense music) - Jim. (tense music) - We'll have to resort to open heart massage. (tense music) (heart beating) (tense music) (drilling) (heart beating) (tense music) It's too late. - No, it's not too late. It's just the beginning. (dramatic music) - Almost through? - She's all yours, lieutenant. Though I can't say I envy you, a real beaut on your hands. - Yeah. Any identification on her? - Nothing, lieutenant. - Figures. Nothing about this makes any sense. Who found the body? - A couple kids playing on the beach. First she called the radio, then she called us. I sent a man up to the house to get a statement but I don't think it will tell us much. - Boy, we got a real (mumbles) on our hands this time. - Okay to move the body, lieutenant? - Yeah, we've got nothing else. Wait a minute, put it down. I've heard the expression I'll cut her heart out, never thought I would see it done. (dramatic music) - Cold? - Not anymore. - I didn't think you ever are. - No? - No. - I am when you're working. - Not when you're working? - We aren't talking about me. I worry about you. - I'm not working now. - I still worry about you. - Now? - Not now. - Then let's not talk about it now. - You never want to talk about it. - Not now I don't. (phone ringing) - Damn. Hello? Hello lieutenant, how are you? I've had better moments. Paul? Yes, he's here. Certainly. - Hello lieutenant. No, that's okay, I wasn't doing anything special. What? When? Yes, sir, I'll be right down. I'm sorry, honey. - I know, we'll talk about it later. - I'll call you after work. - That's not going to help your work any. You have a patient upstairs who's been asking to see you. - I'll be up in a minute. - For a man who should be happy, you have a funny way of celebrating. - Don't push me, Beth. - I wasn't aware I was pushing you. - I'm sorry. I know you're only trying to help. - That's all I've ever tried to do. - I know. I appreciate that. - I don't want your appreciation. - What do you want? - Just what I've got coming, what both of us have coming after all these years. It doesn't matter what Cal Spencer or any of them think now, the operation was a success. - A success we can't tell anyone about. - There will be other operations. With the money we have now, just think of what we can do. - Just think of what we've done. - Didn't we just leave it down at the other place? - They all look alike to me. - Can't get much worse, man, let's go. ♪ You start to light a cigarette ♪ ♪ And all at once ♪ ♪ You love her ♪ ♪ You've scarcely met ♪ ♪ You've scarcely talked ♪ ♪ But all at once ♪ ♪ You love her ♪ ♪ You like her eyes ♪ ♪ You tell her so ♪ ♪ She thinks you're wise and clever ♪ ♪ You kiss goodnight ♪ ♪ And then you know ♪ ♪ You'll kiss goodnight forever ♪ ♪ You wonder where your heart can go ♪ ♪ And all at once ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ You like her eyes ♪ ♪ You tell her so ♪ ♪ She thinks you wise and clever ♪ ♪ You kiss goodnight ♪ ♪ And then you know ♪ ♪ You'll kiss goodnight forever ♪ ♪ You wonder where ♪ ♪ Your heart can go ♪ ♪ And all at once ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ You wonder where ♪ ♪ Your heart can go ♪ ♪ And all at once ♪ ♪ You know ♪ (clapping) - We're looking for the manager. - If I see him, I'll tell him. - We understood that was you. - I don't think you understood at all. - Well maybe you'll understand better downtown. - Not if I don't want to go, man. - Cool it, fella, we just want to ask you a few questions. - What if I don't have any answers? - Why don't we find out? - What's on your mind? - Her. - So? - When's the last time you saw her around? - Who said I did? - If you did, when was it? - If I did, it hasn't been for a couple weeks. - With anyone special? - I didn't ask. - Who might've asked her? - You might try a girl named Doreen. - Where do we find her? - At a club down the street. - What club? - Jazz Room, any time after three. - Thanks for all your help. - Don't mention it, man.

I'm not asking for much. - How much? - $10,000. - I don't have that kind of money. - Then get it. - It'll take time. - I've got time. - Dr. Arnold. - Have you seen Dr. Arnold? - We're paging him now, Dr. Spencer. - Did someone want me? - Dr. Spencer was asking for you... - If you have a minute, Jim. - I really am hurried. - This won't take long. I'd like to apologize for my hastiness last week. I would have sooner but you haven't been around. - I've been busy. - I'm sure you have. I've done a lot of thinking about this operation of yours. - What operation? - The transplant you wanted to perform so badly. I have a few questions about the actual surgical techniques you used. When you severed the heart, you emphasized the use of a particular method of cutting you developed, is this really important? - Important? - Does it have any bearing on the ability of the organism to adapt once it's been transplanted? There aren't too many doctors around who've mastered that technique, you know? - What are you driving at? - Well, there's a certain little lady I'd like you to see. - Hello, Dr. Spencer. - Hi sweetie, how are you today? - Fine. - Cal, what's the meaning of all this? - I'll get right to the point, Jim, I had her brought down here, I'd like you to take a look at her. I've explored all the possibilities within range of my experience. Without your operation, she hasn't got a chance. - I keep coming up with the same questions. You said the cause of death was actually a massive brain hemorrhage? - That's right, lieutenant, 'caused by a blow to the head. - With what? - Possibly a bottle. We found traces of glass in her hair. - What about the heart? - In my opinion, lieutenant, she was probably dead before the heart was removed. - That's the part that stumps me. - What do you mean? - Why remove it at all? - Whoever did, did a nice professional job. - Professional? - The initial incision and severing of the arteries was neat and clean. - How 'bout the stab wounds? - They're only superficial, just an afterthought. - Anger? - Maybe. - Anger or attempted coverup.

I imagine the publicity had a great deal to do with that. - Publicity? - You have informed the press, haven't you? - Well no, I hadn't even thought of... - No, you hadn't even thought of it. Don't matter, I'll remedy that situation once I'm up and around. - I'm sorry. - Clumsy fool. - Tom, have Beth bring in some sheets. - I think I heard her go out. - Check on it, will ya? We'll have this cleaned up in no time. Don't try to get up. - I feel so helpless just lying here. - Don't rush things. Any exertion could still be very dangerous. - Dr. Arnold, about that publicity... - We'll discuss it later. We've talked enough. - All right, doctor, but sometimes I wonder if your modesty doesn't border on stupidity. - It's anything but stupidity, Mrs. Woodruff. - Is that you? - Yeah, it's me. What are you still doing up? - Waiting for you. Are you hungry? - A little, more tired, I guess. - I'll fix you something. - Don't bother now. - You know it's no bother.

(gasping) - What are you doing up? - I couldn't sleep. - That's a universal problem around here. - Jim, when you gonna get the money? - Tom, I'm not so sure... - Not so sure about what? - I'm not so sure that's the way to handle it. - How would you handle it? - Well, I was talking to Beth yesterday. She seems... - What do you mean you were talking to Beth? What the hell has she got to do with it? - Keep your voice down. You seem to forget she has a great deal to do with it. - She's had too much to do with it. Jim, I've got to have it. - What if she decides it's not enough? What if she wants more? - I don't know. I don't know but it's the only way. - All right, I'll see what I can do. - Hey buddy. - Don't you know there's a law against that, lady? - Against what? - Against accosting strange men on the street and on top of that, you're parked in a no parking zone. - Well, I'll go along with the strange part. - What are you doing here, honey? - This is my normal route. - This is just a little bit off your normal route. - Do you have time to talk? - Okay, lieutenant? - You too go ahead. I'll meet you later, Paul, at the hospital. - Thanks a lot. - What hospital? - We're just working on another lead. - At the hospital? - Can you think of a better place to check on surgical technique? Where would you like to go, honey? - I could use a drink. How 'bout the Continental House? - Sounds good to me. - Can I take your order? - Just coffee for me, I'm on duty. - A martini, make that a double and could you ask Doug to play his new song for us? - I'll ask him. (mysterious music) - Thank you. You said you wanted to talk? - I guess I just wanted to see what it was like to have you to myself for awhile. - Seriously honey, what's on your mind? I don't have much time. - I guess I'm tired of waiting in line. - Waiting in line? - We never have any time alone. - Look honey, it's been a hectic week, it's my job. - Is it always gonna be this way? What about after we're married? - Married? Lisa, I can't marry you now. I'm not making enough money. - I make enough modeling. - Honey, you can't model forever. - I don't have to model forever. Just to help us out after you leave the force. - Leave the force? What ever gave you that idea? - Well, it's too dangerous. I want to be your wife, not your widow. You could find another job. - Lisa, being a cop isn't just a job. It's my life's work. When I think I can support you, then we'll start talking about marriage. - What if I'm not around? - What do you mean? - Just what I said. I won't wait forever, Paul. I don't want... - Please, sir, there's a phone call for you. - Thank you.
