Have you any sense? Reminding a lady of her age? Did they teach you that in France? Change it! No candles! Someone will count them and we'll be in trouble. -My ladies! -Paulie! I'm pleased you've come... Come here! Where is your colleague? Not sure, I haven't seen him for a while either. -Hi! -Hello. -Good afternoon. -Greetings. Hi! What a happy gardener you are! You've still got a blooming flower! Come on, then... The flambé will be ready in a moment. -Irene... -Yes, darling? -Where is Mary? She is doing a French translation. Today? Well, she has an exam in two days. Don't get your hopes up. -Bye-bye, honey, I'll call you. -More... -Good God, what's going on? -Irene, you'll never guess what I just saw. I told him to not even look at Mary. -I'll strangle that good-for-nothing! -Take it easy... Excuse me. -I'll kill him! -Calm down! The forthcoming father of our grandchild? What? Father? That's the flambé. This time, it concerns one of our employees: George Klodwig. Make sure we don't have the same result as last time. It has to look like an accident. You get it? Many thanks in advance. 2GRAPES When you dry them out, only the best will remain. And when the best remains, I'll have you pressed. And when you have been pressed, just wonder-nectar will remain. Hang on, don't step there! There neither! My foot got stuck there yesterday. You could fall through. How do the grapes look? They need a bit more time. They don't seem to want to dry. Ask my dad how a straw wine drying area should look. I know how a drying house for straw wine should look. -Not like this. -I know that. Gentlemen, those that don't fancy wine don't fancy work either. -Greetings, Johnnie. -Good morning! Coffee time? Sure, Johnnie, you know that coffee is good for your blood pressure. -What have you got, Eugene? -Wine, can't you see that? Mustn't break it! You'd contaminate the ground! What did I say? It works! One sort of beetle doesn't like another sort, full stop! I don't hear any compliments! How about getting to work, genius? Granddad used to say wine needs gentle care, no hurried decisions. I'm creating a delicate equilibrium in the vineyard. Come on, my sweet worms. Damn! What are you up to? Damn it! Have you gone crazy? -Hiya! -Yeah, ha ha. You've drowned it all here. I might as well start over. -Are those the goat droppings? -No, the goat wasn't cooperating today. Does it work? Or is it like your straw wine? Dad, we've gone through all that. I haven't said much. No one's clever overnight. -Why start with the hardest one, though? -When it dries, it will be sublime. When, when... When you get some sense. When you stop being a prof when you haven't finished primary school. Leave it be. Come on, we'll finish it tomorrow. Coming with us, Dad? No, I have to finish up. And you come over for a change! Now then, my wee worms, all right? Are you thirsty? Johnnie! Look out. Get out of the way. It's warm anyway. It's better ventilated like this. -Water's off. -It was running yesterday. So yesterday I'll rinse today's brushes. I'll pump some water and look at the pipes. Damn it! -What's wrong? -Nothing. -Found the water that's not running. -Great. This needs a plumber. -We should start renovating. -Should if we had the money. When the straw wine is ready, I'll be the most famous winemaker around. -Then I'll build you a super place. -When the straw wine is ready... That will take ages. And God knows what the result will be. -Dad could give us a hand with it. -Dad, Dad... He makes fun of me and I should take his money?! We'll let it fall down, then. It won't be long now. I see, Johnnie, that you've got your hands full. Hello! I hate getting bored, so I make furniture. -What about the vineyard? All right? -It's going fine, come and have a look. This year, it's all bio-production. It's looking really good. Not sure myself. Looks like a bad year. Lots of rain, little sun... Heck, I have a track besides yours and I fancy expanding. Go ahead and expand, Mr. Kozderka. I talked to your granddad about it. Wanted to sell the track next to it. But Granddad passed away and I don't want to sell any tracks. I'd make you a good offer. For your house repairs. Windows, doors... Clare would be pleased. -How are you doing? -I have no complaints. Last year, I sold loads of young wine to Prague. It matured early. Now I use the remains for some excellent home schnapps. -I can see that. -How's that? Christ Almighty... Fire. Fire! In fact, no, don't shout! Fire! Fire! Fire! -Where are you, Mother? Water! -What a prick. Rather torch the place than have his illegal brew discovered. If one can call it a proper brew. -Eugene! Quick! -Bring more water! Another bucket... -Where are you? Get on with you! -I'm done for. -Eugene, help! It's all spitting. -What?! What are you doing, Johnnie? Granddad... I'm repairing the roof. Hmm, I see it all looks rather askew. But no matter. I've fallen off this roof 17 times. Then one fine day, I realized that I couldn't get up again and I lay there for eternity. But you'll have lots of pleasure waiting for you, you'll see. -Hurry up! -Go on! -Hurry up! Get up, then! Why are you rolling about here? I've already paid the other waiter. Johnnie! At last! Are you all right? If you get on that roof again, I'm leaving. That's the fourth time. -You know who I dreamed of? -Granddad? Him, too, that's per usual. He appears often, but this time, George came, too. -Maybe he's dead, too. -I don't think so. You idiot, you survived! Super! -How you doing? -Hiya! What brings you here? -What's that outfit? -Well... -We have to... -If you please, gentlemen. You're living in paradise! Women, wine, song... -Will you help me? -Certainly. I'll tell you everything. Cheers to meeting again! -Excuse me for interrupting. -Good afternoon. I was told one can stay around here. Your place looks the best. I've come a long way and am tired. I have modest needs. Here? We hardly have space for ourselves. -You must be mistaken. -I'll pay generously. Sit yourself down, maybe we'll think of something. -Thank you. Tichý is my name. -Clare Michalicová. -Johnnie. -George. My pleasure. -Mine, too. -Well, I've had a rest, don't want to keep you, and I have a place to find, too. Hang on, Mr. Tichý, don't go anywhere. You know, our neighbor, Mr. Kozderka, is always keen to make money on the side. Try him. A great idea. You'll love it here. First-class accommodation. -I can smell smoke. -A tiny little accident. -You often have a fire? -When I'm not distilling, no. For the duration of my stay, no distilling, please. Certainly. No worries, as I have stocks. -This is the guest room? -This? Sure, for guests. -Strange decorations. -If you don't like them, I will take them down right now. I don't like them much either. What are you up to? It's still smoldering downstairs! Who is this? What's he doing in our bedroom? -Hold on, I'll explain-- -And with shoes on! -Excuse me. You've gone completely crazy! -A stranger in the house? -Excellent! -He's looking for accommodation. -Why at our place? What's wrong? Like, you must understand... it kind of won't wash. -You will stay-- -Here. And you? On the ground floor... the cellar? Well, on the ground floor, the cellar, wherever one can. I hope I will not be disturbed. -That's just an advance payment. -An advance... I'll handle it. Be careful where you put your foot as there are holes. Follow me. Wine from straw, it'll be a bit dry, won't it? Not from straw. From this. I call it tiny grapes. Just tiny ones. What an idea! And if it fails, you can sell the raisins. You're so dense you can't even listen to me? -I'm all ears, carry on. -These are prepared grapes. When the grapes dry, only a sweet juice will remain. From that, one makes superb wine. At least I hope so. -Irene... -Leave me alone! Such shame! Mary! Fuck it... Irene... I didn't want this. It concerns our daughter! That wretch doesn't even know she's expecting. -We'll find her another groom. -Nonsense. Who would you find? She's our daughter and she's pregnant with this one. How could it happen? We've always been so careful. That didn't help her much. Look what I found in her room. It looks like genuine love, hey? Asshole. -You know what, I'll go there by myself. -Where to? Here, of course. Look. It's his only friend. He doesn't have anybody else, just him and Mary. He told her. -Where is it? -Somewhere in Moravia. -In Moravia? -Yep. -I'm not off to some Moravia. -How do you know where to? -The photo reverse has "VIN." Irene, how do you know "VIN" means "Vines"? From Moravian Helen in the kitchen. Yeah, Moravian Helen from the kitchen is bound to know. Do us a favor-- do you know how many Vines there are in Moravia? -Ten for certain. -So what? -We'll look at all of them? -Why not? Food is ready, you nightingales, or you'll be sick soon. -That's a grand idea. -Hmm. -Who is it? -Johnnie... I'm off, then... No getting out of this one. -What? -What's the hurry? -I told you not to climb there. -Your ladder is busted. It was old anyway. I must say, a weird spot to leave the pitchfork. That's our way of life. Moravia, a way to break your neck. At least we're not bored. Do you fancy a tasting? -I've prepared the very best. -Might as well right away. This is my kingdom. My wines are first-class. Known for it far and wide. If anybody says different, then don't believe them. We'll start with a white. I have a wonderful Müller. White? I'd prefer a red. Have any? Sure. Just give me five minutes. Yep, a red. I've got Blue Portuguese. In oak casks, an archive wine. The French have been asking for it. Maddie, let's sleep in the washroom. It's awfully damp here. There are cockroaches. -If you wish, go ahead. -You saw his fat wallet. When he's had a few, I'll sell him all my stock. Then we can visit Croatia or whatever place you want. 'Cause of that, I'm supposed to sleep in a tent outside my own house? Imagine, then, you're already on holiday. -Where shall I cook? -You mean you cook? Well, if I wanted to, I'd have nowhere to do it! Thank God for that! Oh, hell, we've overslept. Clare! Damn it! If she went on her own to the vineyard, we're in a pickle, But if we rush now, we can say we had a long, drawn-out breakfast. -Look... -Budejovice station twice! You sure didn't save yourselves. We... -Have you been to the vineyard? -Someone has to do it. I don't mind him being here nor your drinking, but you know what? If you're OK about the drinking and him, what's the problem? Wait! It's all different now. We were never best friends, but we kind of stuck together. He has no one else, right? It will never be the same. I'm more sensible and... -And he has also changed. -Yeah? He was abroad, worked, and he's no longer the irresponsible madman. I'm Santa! -Your water isn't running. -No, it isn't. John will pump up some. I've brought you some breakfast. Moravian müesli. -What's Moravian müesli? -Pork dripping. -Dripping, hey? -Clare! No worries, I'll rein him in. An extra pair of hands are useful. If he wants to stay, he has to graft. I'm curious to see the results. Could you please pick up the paint and get the roof tiles as they've been ordered. -Don't take too long, it will rain. -Order, ma'am! Good afternoon! How did you sleep? Was the bed too hard? Could you tell me what kind of wine we drank yesterday? What do you mean? -Only the best. -And is this normal? Hmm... it is! It was Blue Portuguese after all. That's the way it is. Look... We'll drink white this evening, and that will neutralize it. I might not be here then. -That's big enough. -Perfect. Thanks! -I'm off to town, you coming? -Into town? -And Clare is going, too? -No. -That's something else, then! -Hang on, don't plan anything. We celebrated yesterday, and today we'll graft a bit. -Is that clear? -Clear. Damn, you telling me that machine still works?! Depends on the day. Get out and come and push. Enjoy it, boys. -Let's have a glass. -We'll slowly be on our way. Why say you're off slowly when you're going fast? Just look at them. Never seen that before. It's started. -Let's jump out! -No! Just hang on! -Damn, you sure went for it! -Brakes don't work, as per usual. Wow, some journey. -Put the handbrake on. -It's in the boot. -What? Wait! You remember what we agreed on? No... messing around. WINE BAR Blast... Hello! Sure, I know. Went to Moravia to see a friend. I am on their tail. Please don't call me all the time. I need peace for my work. -Fuck it! -Paul, are you all right? Yes, just feel a little bit queasy. -It is a 2002 vintage... -Hi. -Put it into the archive cellar. -Sure. -Careful with the door handle. -Right. Come on. Oops... Wait. Hello! Well, no worries. There's always another exit. -We're up the spout, you get it? -Not really... We're up in paradise. -I hope painting goes well. Bye. -See you. You piss me off. I have to see Clare. You're chortling like an idiot. Is it all that bad here? I'll kill you. You get it, asshole? No, hang on, paints for Clare. See. -Don't touch me. -Relax, I won't harm you. And came along shepherd Les with a flared mustache... Damn it, I forgot how it goes... I don't know what follows. Wait! -What's up? -Something for Clare. -Don't mess with me. I've gotten you into this mess, so I'll get you out of it. -Here! Great, hey? -Perhaps... It's perfect. Clare will be pleased. You'll see. Off we go. -Easy does it, right? -If you say so. Good afternoon. -Who's doing the driving, then, lads? -Me. Well, a little sobering up is in order first, agreed? -Keys! -Can't do. Can't do? You're being uncooperative, is that right? No, it's just that I don't have the keys. I just wire it each time. You're telling me this, a policeman? -I don't want to lie to you. -He doesn't want to lie! Relax. We'll reduce the fine for sincerity's sake... Screw it, we're all human, hey? You can't take to the road drunk like this. Clear? But my roof is leaking straight on my straw wine. -If I don't get there in time-- -Should have thought of that earlier! -Lads, you're making straw wine? -He has tons at home! How do you wire the car to start? You have to really work at it when even the wiring doesn't work! Yeah, and the brakes don't work! Brake using the engine! You're kidding, right? This never happened, understand? You're the boss! Damn it! -See, we're right here. -No. Let's see, I want to look. -See, we're exactly here. -Let's see. But we're not. I'll have a look. You can't be great at everything. -I'm glad that Mary has a man. -Why exactly? Because someone has to take over from you. Heck, in a while, you won't even be able to find the bathroom. You know what? Just put your navigation on. -May I, you sure? -Show me, how do you work it? Hey... that's great! I think that after this, I'll survive anything. Some journey! This will be one hell of a mess. Clare will kill me. -Now, guys, time for a glass, hey? -Shhh! -Surely no woman rules over you. -You bet a woman rules over me. It's important to frame it to appear to the woman that she should be glad that you came to no harm. Main thing is that your beloved stirrer doesn't stir too much. -I don't like it. -I think it'll work fine. We'll enter as if it was nothing, all right? You have to act as if you were totally beaten up, right? We will insist that you were attacked. They kicked you in the knee, but you've recovered, OK? -And they hit me over the head. -Hmm. Hey, catch him! -What's he up to? -Stop messing around, will you?! -Like he's wounded. Isn't he? -Make up your mind! Clare! You'll never guess what happened to us! We were attacked in town... -Policemen... -...attacked. -They saved us. Really? The important thing is you're all right. I may be stupid, but not deaf-- so next time, at least take a look! Hang on a moment, Clare! I'll explain. I was really locked inside a wine cellar. I of course believe you, but I'm fed up here. The power is off again and everything is falling on top of us. I'm leaving! Not now. -Clare... -Let me be! -Allow me to explain at least. -Should have been here hours ago! -Where are the paints? -They're up... Heck, your fuses need to be turned back on! Of course! It'll work now! Paints... Clare! Just wait... Carefully! Lay him down here. I have no more strength! -What happened? -Carefully! -Christ, what was he doing there? -Probably looking for us. -Why is he wet? -I don't know. -Mr. Tichý! -Mr. Tichý! -Did you try to repair the pipes? -Yeah, that's for sure! Most kind! -Clare! Where are you off to? -Leave me in peace! -This is all too much! -Clare, wait. What shall we do with him? I'll call the ambulance, right? -No need, I'm fine. -Are you sure? Sure, miss. -We'll carry him, OK? -Come on, then. Mr. Tichý, beddy-byes? Let's-- we'll dump him there. On two! Ooplah! One, two! -Turn him off. -Thank you. No worries, friends, I'll cure him. This will put you on your feet. Let it go! Clare! It's not all that serious. We were stuck in a wine cellar. Couldn't pick the lock. More like your luck is out. End of story. -Where are you running off to? -I have to chase my woman, too. I'm not surprised in your case. You are approaching your destination on your right-hand side. We are... up the creek. Irene, do me a favor and tell me how many Vines that stupid machine has in it. -What use is my intuition, then? -Screw all use, Paulie. I assumed we'd come here and everything would get sorted out. I've had enough. I can't go on. Irene, now, now... Come over here, you're stressed out. I'll drive, all right? Guys, I see clearly that you have a few problems here, but we'll be back on Friday for that straw wine, clear? And woe to you if it isn't ready! Thanks... many thanks! So what? I'm such a dumbo! Too true! But then again it's nothing too serious. You know, all women are whimsical. Clare loves you. Who else would do all this for you? I know. Maybe I'm incapable of it. I wanted to do something properly, but it's coming apart at the seams. Winemaking isn't for everybody. But you're my grandson and you must have it in your blood. Hmm, but where exactly? Maybe I should listen to Clare's dad. I'll tell you one thing, Johnnie. Better to mess it up your way than according to what someone else tells you to do, right? That was my credo throughout my carnal life. -What are you messing around for? -What do you think? Digging a ditch. -It draws water away from the house. -But it's the roof that's leaking. Do you have water on the roof or below? Where did Tichý get his comeuppance? Look, the damp comes from below. -What are you on about, Mr. Engineer? -Just pick up a shovel and help me. So Clare knows we're actually doing something. -Oh, my God, are you all right? -Yes. -Where are we? -Not sure, but... You've dug through to some gas piping. I'd say not. It's a cellar! -Brake! And we've arrived! -But this isn't the place. Irene, wait! Just please wait! Don't mess around, Irene. I mean it, wait. What's up? We agreed on something, didn't we? Irene, hang on here, please, and I'll look around inside to see if everything is all right. -Good afternoon. -Hello. I've had enough of your paranoia! You'll just scare him! Nothing to be afraid of. I won't harm him. Wait! Hang on. I am doing it for our safety, right, Mr. Tichý? Pick it up, you turd. Go on! What? Damn, I'm rich! I've got my own wine cellar! Only kidding. Ugh, what a hole, like the entrance to hell. -Very nice. One could expect this. -What are you doing? One could break one's neck here. Please, Irene, let's get away from this place! Having finally arrived, I won't budge until George shows up. Or at least that friend of his. I'm going inside to see if by any chance they're in. Look, there's not even a door. What kind of family is this? -Who is it? -Don't know. Never met them. Some people, just strangers. Never met them? They knew your name! -No idea. -All right, then. Hello! Wait, wait, just wait... -I'll tell you, but keep it a secret. -We'll see about that. I must admit I'm disappointed. I expected a higher standard. I very much expected this. You haven't changed your mind? No, no. We'll see what he has to say. Maybe this is just a store. But... Why do you always have to get mixed up in something like this? There are lots of girls, but you have to chat up a daughter of a mafioso. You know what I'll do? Climb up and call them over. No, better if I get out, leave you here, and fill in all of this. Sure, go ahead and snitch on a friend! Or even better, I'll go myself. No, slow down, don't be stupid. -Have a corkscrew? -Not a good idea. You'll sell a few bottles, repair the house as you want, and Clare will sing your praises. She has to when your almost father-in-law throttles the voice out of me. Damn, I have to see her! But how? Damn it! See, God exists. Another cellar. And in a lot better shape. -Freedom! -A fine chance of that for you! If he saw us coming, he won't return. Isn't this his house? Quite pleasant, albeit somewhat rural. I have an idea. I'll go and ask the neighbors whether they know where they are. Give me his photo! Where is justice, man? I'm screwed and you just get richer. Look! Useful. Come on! -Stop! -What's up? -We'll put it back into place. -Have you gone mad? No time for that. If your neighbor finds out, you can say bye-bye to your cellar. A few minutes' risk is worth it, no? Maybe you'll buy a new roof and a ticket to Mexico. -I don't want to go to Mexico. -But I do. Come on. Those are the boys from next door, but I don't know where they are now. -Most likely Mr. Tichý will know. -You know Mr. Tichý? You bet. He is renting our bedroom. -Kindly tell me where he is now. -Probably still in his bed. Wait! In Moravia, we tend to use the gate. Should have known, sending a drunken bum to Moravia! Up we go! I didn't send you here to spend my money boozing! You came here to work! We'll include a substantial discount in a new contract! The man wasn't feeling too well, so I gave him a tranquilizer. -My own. -You'll soon stop winking, I swear! Move and make sure you get this bloke on his feet! Quickly! Move or they'll catch us! -Old man, I am borrowing the bike! -For how long? -Maybe forever. -Get on with it, then! Gentlemen, did you notice? The behavior of a real man! Not like the one who stole your old lady's bike. Christ, hang on. Where are you off to?! We have to disappear or he'll find us! You get lost where you want. I'm off to see Clare. -What happened? Why are you so red? -There's not even any water. No class! -You found him and finished him off. -Irene, you have weird notions! -What's going on, then? -I've put it all together. They've gone off to Prague to-- to some wine seminar. Nobody knows when they are getting back. So we're going home. In that case, we have to leave a message for him and welcome him with open arms and hope he gets back quickly. It has to be sincere so he understands we are serious. Come over here and sit down. You write and I'll dictate. Now then: Dear George. But quickly, please. Dear George... Jesus... Basically it's simple, if you don't take care of the vineyard, it won't look after you. Whoever thinks that winemaking is just gulping wine can pack it in. This is Green Veltliner, anyone can see that. -Good day. -Good one. -I have to talk to you. -Likewise. I kind of expected that. Wait here and don't touch anything. You, too. You're students, right? Grand. I think I have things to pass on. As I am a cellar owner, it is vital to guard the wine... fields with vineries. At this stage, we will split up into group A-- group A being formed by two students and yourself. You will go and consider the quality of the wine over there. Off you go! Who knows how much time each one is allotted in life? As the classic says... Make it shorter. He'll fall asleep and won't even finish it. You're right. Take another piece of paper and we'll start over. -Dear George... -Yes, sure. -I have come because... -I know, I've talked to Clare. She'll come around and reconsider. She's a bit nervous about you. As for myself, do as you please, but if she gets nervous, I get nervous, and I do mind that. -Your straw wine is ample proof. -You know that... I told you, you're starting off at the most difficult end. -Where should I begin? -You have to start at full steam. -I've done that. -And then add gradually. But I want to do something exceptional, something extra. I'll tell you, my friend, what is extra. Good wine, that's something extra. St. Martin's wine for example... I wait for it a whole year. And then on November 11th... -That's something... Here! -I really want a go at straw wine. Not only for Clare but also to dig ourselves out of our debts. Maybe it will work out and everyone will gape open-mouthed. Johnnie, I'd love it if I gaped, but I just hope that I'd do so for the right reasons. Hmm. But at the moment, I have another burden to bear. I need to talk to Clare and it's not safe back home at present. -What? -That will be worked out. Where is she? She's working with Frank. You care to tell me what's up? I'll tell you all one day. Maybe over a glass of straw wine. Will I live to see the day? One has to prune very carefully. It's like a manicure. May I ask for your hand? No worries, it's not binding. Miss, don't give him your hand. He has a skin disease, is unemployed, has five kids, and doesn't pay alimony. Many thanks for that. And I don't have a skin disease. What discount? Is it my fault? I'll kill him for free if necessary. I see you now! Yikes, that was Tichý and he didn't even say hello. He's also splitting. If I had his bike, I'd have been gone a long time ago. Come on, then, little boy. Follow me, I know a shortcut. Moravia will finish me off. Damn! I'll shoot down this hill. Look out, it's bumpy! George, still among the living? Possibly, but I've got two bikes. We are leaving you a small donation, comma, which I hope will fully cover your travel costs. Full stop. Sign it: your second parents. What do you mean by the "small donation"? You'll leave some money, right? He gets our daughter pregnant and we leave him a donation?! What do you think parents' wedding gifts are? It's the same thing. -The difference is one's point of view. -That's awful. Get used to it, dear. It's about life, and one should support life. So get that wallet out! Two hundred? That doesn't even cover the train. What am I supposed to do? I have no more cash on me, only credit cards, so what am I to do? Find a cash machine, then! Irene, this is no Monte Carlo, we're in Vines. You're the man, think of something! -Don't squirm so much! -My butt hurts. This place is somewhat familiar. I must have been here before. -I said you knew Frank. -Frank? My God, you mean that Frank? You've lost your marbles, no way... You forgot I screwed his wife? -He doesn't remember that. -He went for me with a rifle. That was ages ago and I must see Clare. You calmly take me to my funeral and don't even bother to tell me. Stop, now! Stop! Stop! I told you he'd recognize me. You idiot! Hi! How are you? What brings you here? -I'm working! What brings you here? -I've come to ask how you are. Yeah? I thought it would be something more fascinating. Originally, I was going to say I'm sorry and ask you to come home, but now I must tell you that you mustn't come home. -What? -Well, not like this. I of course want you to come home. -But not just yet. -Getting better all the time. Hang on, there's been a calamity at home. An accident. I naturally want to put it right before you return. On top, there is one big surprise waiting for you there. They found me, now they're waiting for me. And threw a knife at me. Good. Apart from that, they are all over John's house and want to destroy his straw wine. You telling me they want to get their hands on Johnnie's straw wine? Off we go! Right now! Personal disagreements later. Johnnie! We seem to be closed today, said the wise man. -Let's fix those personal problems. -I'm scared. I don't wonder. Irene, love! Paulie is home! Oh, bank machine! The bastard is empty! Or not working! Paul! -Kocúrik here... -Where are you? What are those people up to? -They might have done them in. -Why are you carrying an axe? Just to be sure. I thought I was dead and being eaten by worms. What have they got this filth for? Congratulations! Getting rat-assed like this. Pah! What stink! I don't even want to look at you! What if George saw you? Such shame! Irene, Jesus Christ, fuck it! I've left my cell phone somewhere among those worms. -Good morning. -What do you want now? -Don't worry, boys, I'll help you. -Are you demented? Boys! Johnnie! -But the boys aren't here. Although I'd be very eager to find out where they are. What's the axe for? Just that... Johnnie asked me if I'd help him to repair the fence, and I said to myself, "Why ever not, Eugene?" -I like to help others. -Hmm. You are most kind. The fence will wait, but repair the door so we're not on display. -Paul? -What? OK. Here is some cash and get a move on and get it finished. Sure thing. Come on, fragrant one, I've prepared a bath for you. Come on. What are you doing here? We're off to sort something out. Let's go, Johnnie! -The sorting out includes wine? -I have no idea what the plan is. -I see. Fine, then. -Wait here. Get on with it! Clare! I've got something for you to wear. Show me. You're joking. I can't put that on. Not your style, but at least George will see you have a sense of humor. -Looking for someone? -Know John Adámek by any chance? I do indeed. Why? I need to talk to him. Do you know where he is? I may not tell you as I am interested in what business you have with John Adámek. None with him, but with this one. You know him? Yep. Have a glass? Yes, but rather water. I am off alcohol for a bit. I see. Why are you lounging about here? It's lovely outside. How can I go outside in this? Why not? Take it off, then, and get a suntan. Come on. Finished, the door is like new. -Thank you and bye-bye! -You're most kind, thank you. Hey, Irene, any idea where the car keys are? In your jacket, aren't they? They're not there nor in my trousers, as I've looked. Then they are in that manure where you lay all night. If you need anything else, I am still here. -Come on, then, I'll show you. -Fucking worms... -How many months pregnant are you? -In my second month. He doesn't know yet. It's all gotten complicated now as Mom spilt the news to Dad and he's a terrible lunatic. And he never liked George anyway. Dad had all kinds of plans for me such as London, Business Studies, -and similar idiocies. -Right here. Supposedly, it's all for my own good. Now he's decided he'll kill George-- I'll do it for his running away! Frank, easy does it, I can't go in there. I see, Johnnie, they've made themselves comfortable. I'll take a look around and if anything blows up, -I'll give you a sign. -Understood. -What's her name? -Irene. Irene. Sweet. Hello, what fine weather we are having, Mrs. Irene. Too true. -How do you know my name? -George told me. -Really? What else? -Like that you are out to kill him. No, our plan is quite different. We have decided first to marry the boy off, right, Irene? Only if that doesn't succeed, we will... -Paul... -The notion isn't altogether alien to me. -Pardon me, but who might you be? -Frank Mátl is my name, and George sends me with a modest gift as proof of his respect. Excellent, please go in. We must discuss this more thoroughly, am I right? Irene, you stay! Stay! I say you stay! You got totally drunk! The amount consumed was fair, one must admit... -What a gimp! -Ugh! The pig spat in the cellar. -Eugene! Snack time! -I'm coming! Boys, come over here! Great, I'm looking for him all this time and he toddles in by himself. Do you know, George, why we are here? Probably so Mr. Kocúrik can kill me. Now, now, you know it's entirely possible. No, no, no. No killings, Paulie. In this family, only new life will be allowed. -What? -You get it, don't you? Dear George, an exceptional situation has arisen for which you have a large share of responsibility. -Understand? -I fail to understand. You idiot, Mary is pregnant! -How pregnant? -I really will murder the fool! Paulie! No killings allowed! Today we toast the father's health. Bottoms up! Cheers! -Sorry, but where is Mary? -At home. Waiting for us. We'll have a drink and quickly go home. A family must be together. Right? -Who will drive? -Paulie! No, Paulie will not drive as he has been imbibing. You haven't been drinking? I am observing your every step! -Just wanted to get some wine. -Is there not enough here? I wanted to get some vintage wine. To celebrate. All right, go on, then. But don't run off anywhere. -Guard him well. -I better go with him. -And my congratulations. -Thank you. I see, old friend, -that big changes await you. -I fail to comprehend. Hmm, such is life. Could you leave me on my own for a moment? Thank you. Do you have a light, young man? Fiddlesticks... Idiot! Just keep on running, boy, don't stop. But I'll tell you something. Something exciting at last. What are you doing here, you good-for-nothing?! Running away. Paulie! The groom is running away! Come, come, a morsel for me. Hurry up! I'm an older person. I can't run like I'm possessed. -Where are they? -There... there. Just scattered. -I'll try to cut them off up there. -All right. Ugh, I got a fright. Is that you? Relax, now you're really safe. George, stop, you're mad! I know a spot where no one will find you. You can stay a few days and then go anywhere you want. -George, hang on. Stop! -Come along. -In fact, come on, the pair of you. -Can't you see, you dumbo? Responsibility, work, a child, it's like being condemned to death. To the contrary, boy, this is death. I tell you, if they haven't got the straw wine, I'll arrest them for sure. -They won't make a fool of me. -Sure thing, relax. You wait, hang on there! Stop! Wow, some height! Why must you always run somewhere? I'm now paying for your shit, you get it? Will you ever be sensible? Could we not settle this until we are up on top? -No! Pull him up! -You mean you're canceling the order? Yes, I'm canceling the order. What's the other one doing here? -Wholesale catch. -I won't pay any extra. No matter, I thought of it as being on the house. -But if there is no need... -Quite right, Dad, no going soft! Mary, my fairy, could we not argue over this when I am up there? Throw me back again if you must, but I can't hang on anymore. No fairy for you, tell me right now why you scuttled off! -What did I do to you? -My little fairy, nothing. -It's just you're a little bit... -A little bit what? If I remembered, I'd tell you, but pretty please... -Dominant! -That's it, dominant! One has to be dominant with a manic-depressive, self-destructive maniac. Mary, could you leave the psychoanalysis for later and pull us up?! You deserted me and your-- abandoned the two of us! Mary, I didn't know the good news! She's right for you, perfect for you. -I know, thanks! -You deserve her. God Almighty, what's going on here? Pull them up! Mary! You want to be a widow so soon? Dad can arrange it for you later! Stop messing around! Pull them up! Christ! Police! In the name of the law, you are coming with us! -You are under arrest. -Can you tell me what it all means? -Off we go! Now! -Who is it? A certain man I was involved with businesswise. You called him earlier?! We'll work this out later! -Irene, let it go-- -Come on, please! Get a move on! Christ! I was hoping you wouldn't come up. Time is of no consequence. She'll drown me anyway. I'll do it myself. You won't get away with it so easily. I want to see you beg. Tell me... Tell me what now? Nothing. -What do you mean, nothing? -Simply nothing. I was thinking mid-flight, as there was quite a lot of time, and I thought that if you... That I'd be extremely happy if you wanted... I see I'll need to throw you off more often. Now then... I'll need to find someone else. Someone who will love me and doesn't run away each time I tell him I'm pregnant. But I love you. I am a terrible public speaker, so I'll be brief. Taste this wine. But firstly I'll tell you one thing. I'd rather not give away my daughter to anybody. But this young man has done something which even I must respect. Just taste these here... -Tiny grapes. -Yes, tiny grapes. It's worth it! He did it without experience, knew nothing about it, nobody believed in him-- me neither. He doesn't know how he's managed it, but it's here. That's how it goes. And in this way, I hope you two will succeed together. I just hope your roof doesn't leak so damn much. -So, cheers! -Cheers!
