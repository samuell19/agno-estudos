Since this is my wish, you have to grant it. No. I can't grant you such a wish. {\a6}You tell me that I am foolish, Even your last wish, you'll use it on me? That's not it. This wish is for me. {\a6}too weak hearted person, No! How can this wish be for you? {\a6}and helpless when in love. Does that make any sense? Goo Dong Baek, you love me, don't you? And I love you, Goo Dong Baek. {\a6}Because I'm foolish, Then we can't do something like divorcing, {\a6}you're all that I know it's so simple. Ji Soo. Don't tell me there's no other way! {\a6}Because of you, I have become a naive, It isn't because there's no other way. {\a6}and foolish person. I was a fake. Even now, I'm a fake. {\a6}Because I love you too much, Because I love you, a divorce doesn't mean it's the end for us. {\a6}and there are things I couldn't say {\a6}you don't know in my head, It's a new beginning. After we get the divorce, I want to start anew with you. {\a6}there are only thoughts of you. {\a6}I am foolish. I want to be real. So, this wish really is for me. What does 'real' and 'fake' mean? It's all in our minds whether it's real or not. That's just an excuse. It's because you want to place this heavy load all on yourself, don't you think I know that? Ji Soo. How are you going to explain this to Min Ji? And the post office... that post office you love so much, do you think you can keep working there? Everyone will hate you. They'll make an anti-fan of you. That... that's more difficult to endure than you think. Much more. I know this will be a difficult task. I'm sure it'll be hard. But... but, under this square sky, if you will be with me, {\a6}In my heart, there are only thoughts of you.

Ji Soo, give us a statement! Is it true that Dong Baek cheated on you? Who cheated? Did you see it with your own eyes? Ji Soo. Well then, they say Goo Dong Baek and Park Kyung Ae have been lovers for a long time, is that not true? Is there anyone here that witnessed it personally? Did you see it? Did you? Let's go in. Hurry! One more word, please! Please give us one more statement! Han Ji Soo, one more word please! What good is it to fight with the reporters? What do they know? Yes, Ji Soo. You haven't changed your mind? No. Okay, then. I'll tell the reporters too that we're getting a divorce. Since you say it's your wish, I'll go along with it. You're satisfied, right? Since we're getting a divorce, I guess you have to stay there. I need to pack up all this stuff. Should I send them to you through Suk Hyun? It'll probably look more natural to the people that way, right? Right? That'll be better, right? Yes. I think that will be better. Ji Soo, please smile. There's no other way but to just smile. [Actress Han Ji Soo to divorce, husband's affair the reason] Postmaster, we've brought Dong Baek's standing posters. Is that so? Did you bring all of them? Not exactly every one. We had to scrap two of them. What, why? One was outside the building and it was set on fire. What, set on fire? The other one... I don't know if someone threw feces on it, but oh the smell. What, feces? Yes. Well okay, I can understand them. This is now the reality of the image of our post office. I mean... I mean how can something like this happen twice? Park Kyung Ae, this evil that's come into my and Gu Dong Baek's lives, wipes our office with feces and then leave? What brings you here so early? Did you come to beat up on my brother? Then go ahead, and do it for me too. Sang Chul, you haven't eaten breakfast yet, have you? Have some breakfast and try to get Min Ji to eat too. Oppa, Sang Chul didn't come here to have breakfast. He came to beat you up. Right, okay. Sang Chul, eat up to you'll have more strength to hit my brother harder. Maybe then, he'd come to his senses. Don't cry, kid. I'm doing this to make it better for me. You really must have gone insane. To make it better, you're getting a divorce? Does that even make sense? Ahjussi, let's go outside. Min Ji, make sure you eat. I'm going to work. He's crazy. He's really crazy. Ahjussi, do you want to take noona and Min Ji and go to Australia? Should we go and stay there for about 2 years? By then, don't you think people may have forgotten all about this? If you, Ji Soo, Min Ji, and I can all be together, it doesn't matter if it's Australia or Korea. Our courtyard is nice, don't you think? We'll make Bulgogi that you love so much, make crab stew that I love, eat cherry tomatoes that Ji Soo loves, and make stir fried Octopus that Min Ji loves. All together, we'll play games, and just have fun. I can make it through this, Sang Chul. Keep an eye on Min Ji for me, okay? And make sure she eats. If people don't eat, what happens? I'm leaving. Mae Hyung*! {\a6} (*NOTE: Mae Hyung: Brother-in-law) Mae Hyung! Ahjussi is still my Mae Hyung even if you get divorced. Don't forget that! Oh, cherry tomatoes. Wait just a minute! Welcome. Please give me one basket. Yes, I understand. For someone who's getting a divorce, isn't his expression too bright? Let's go. And he ate a lot at lunch today, too. Could it be that he's going to divorce and take up with Kyung Ae? Stop with that kind of talk! Thank you. Yes, thank you. Enjoy them. D..Dong Baek! Behind you...! Sunbae! Goo Sunbae! I don't think Ji Soo wants to see you. She said she won't come out. Oh? That's okay. I just stopped by because I was worried. I should have made Park Kyung Ae be more careful. I can't believe she created such a situation. I thought she was just a naive girl. How did the decision of the divorce come about? Goo Dong Baek is the one that said let's do it. I'm sure things are going to be a bit noisy with the divorce and all. You'll leave the country for a while, aren't you? This might hurt you but Goo Dong Baek and Ji Soo, they're only going through the formality of a divorce. I don't think they have any intentions of breaking up. I had no idea things would turn out this way. Oh, I see. Ji Soo. What's wrong? Goo Dong Baek, by one of my fans... - Oh, it's Han Ji Soo... - She's here, she's here. Just one moment please. Please give us a statement. What do you think about what happened? Is it true? Just one statement please. Han Ji Soo! You came, Ji Soo? Wow, Ji Soo is really loyal. You must have ran out as soon as you heard. Are you okay? Yes. They said there's just slight fracture in the arm. Unni. Let's leave the room. Noona, come on. Wow, for a person visiting a patient in the hospital, how can you not bring even a can of juice and came empty handed? And I really love canned peaches. You sure don't have any manners. You can joke at a time like this? Yes, it seems I can. Seeing you like this makes me happy. Ah Ji Soo, since you're here, would you peel a banana for me? I hurt my arm so I can't peel them. And peeling is your specialty... great at shooting stones, and great at peeling grapefruit... Here. Hmph, won't it be so nice for you to feed it to me? I am a patient, after all. In life, there aren't only bad things in life. Since I hurt my arm, I'm so comfortable. Good for you and your comfort. Yes, it's nice. But Ji Soo, if we're not careful, people may think it strange that you're visiting a husband who cheated on you. And we don't want strange people like Reporter Baek following you around. Since we decided to get a divorce, we shouldn't be meeting like this. You know, right? I know. But today, since you got hurt because of me so just for today, I'm going to stay by your side. Manager unni, in all honesty, I can't understand what's going on. When I was in school, I wasn't a very good student but I understood things. Please explain this situation to me. Why did unni come here? If she wanted a divorce, then she should be very angry. So why did she come here? Don't you agree? Because he got hurt. This is an emergency situation, an emergency. And you. Why have you been guarding me all day? Well that, that's because our relationship has nothing to do with those two people. Are we the ones parting? Don't play with me. I can't figure out a single thing here. I feel so bad for Min Ji. Should we tell her the truth? No. Don't ever tell her. It's not over between the two of them. Kang Mo waited a long time for Ji Soo because she wanted to become an actress. But they'll be getting married soon. When? They were going to get married when Kang Mo's father's election was over. So, they're probably very busy right now, getting ready for the wedding. [Actress Han Ji Soo Divorce] Here. Thank you. They're going to take this off in 4 weeks but I wish I can keep it on longer. If I had to feed you for 4 weeks, I'd probably become annoyed. Oh, is that so? Alright next, seasoned Daikon radish. Okay. Uhm, oppa... if I continue to sit here, I think my head will start to spin. So I'm going to the shop. - Okay. - Okay. This seems to have Min Ji really confused. Do you think she'll be okay? I'm sure she'll be fine. She's a pretty positive person. Okay, again. Seasoned Daikon radish one more time. It's so hard trying to eat with my left hand. Won't you feed it to me? But you're left handed! Oh, you know so much about me. Of course. How much time have we spent together? I just don't like anyone associated with Han Ji Soo. So what if they're a fan? Are they gangsters? Who are they to attack our Dong Baek? If I were there at the scene, I wouldn't have left them alone. Our Dong Baek... With this purple towel on your head, you look like Aladdin. Oh really? You look like him now. Excuse me. Oh? Han Ji Soo? Oh. Park Kyung Ae, what brings you here? I heard you were hurt. Isn't the water too cold? No, it's not cold. Okay, blow. Aigoo, so cute. Oh so refreshing. Ji Soo, thank you. I'll be right out after I change my clothes. Okay. Okay. Han Ji Soo! Why are you here washing Goo Dong Baek's face? Because Goo Dong Baek hurt his arm. What is this nonsense? Don't you know it's because of your fan that he got hurt? Don't you know why my fan was angry? But, you two are getting a divorce. And it's reported all over the newspapers. Isn't it time you two stopped seeing each other? Omo, why did you bring so much? Why are you acting like you're the owner here? I bought this for Goo Dong Baek. I understand. I won't have any. Dong Baek, are you okay in there? Yes, I'm fine. Omo-mo. And what if he's not okay in there. You're going to put his clothes on for him like a real wife? What is that laugh about? By any chance, do you care for Goo Dong Baek? Yes. Really? Why? Does there have to be a reason for why you care for someone? This isn't right. That's not supposed to be. What can't be? Is it for real? Do you really care for Goo Dong Baek? What's going on? What did that man tell me? He told me Han Ji Soo didn't care for Goo Dong Baek. He said if they got divorced, things will work out well for us. What is this mess? Han Ji Soo cares for Goo Dong Baek. What do I do now? If things continue this way, am I going to just end up a duck egg? After the two get divorced, Han Ji Soo will be going to Canada so just trust me. And don't call me needlessly. I'm hanging up now. ...waited a long time... But they'll be getting married soon. When? They were going to get married when Kang Mo's father's election was over... - How? Reporter Baek must have somehow found out where Ji Soo's mom was. I did what I could but there's not much time. Yun Kyung, I know it might be difficult but hurry up finalizing the divorce, and try to convince Ji Soo to go to Canada with you for a while. Canada? If this gets out, the reporters may even start harassing Ji Soo's mother. With her ill health and all, don't you think that'll make it harder on Ji Soo? This is driving me insane! I found a place that you can go with Ji Soo's mother. Hurry up and make the decision then let me know. There really isn't much time. Just sitting here makes me want to walk. Should we do that? Yes. I don't mean here. Outside. We can't go outside. If two people about to get a divorce act like this, how strange will that seem to them? Ji Soo, why don't you go home now. I really am fine. If the reporters gather around, it'll get more complicated. Wow, this is just like being in a prison. How much longer do you think we have to be here like this? I don't know. A few months? A few years? No. This isn't right. If we want to go outside, we will. All day long, I felt strange. As a broken clock, I sit and stare If I happen to run into you I am now going to confess my love to you. {\a6}So many people in the world Don't you think we're a little strange? {\a6}where can my love be? How so? {\a6}Whoa, my heart feels unsettled When we were faking, we went anywhere we wanted. Now that we really care for each other, we have to sneak around. {\a6}I yell out my request We're so strange. {\a6}Que Sera, Que Sera You are like an angel But I'm still happy. How can this make you happy? {\a6}and I will keep you in my heart Because we can have a secret date that only you and I know about. {\a6}Que Sera, Que Sera In my heart is only you {\a6}you just have to take it You really have to go now, Ji Soo. I guess so. I'll walk you down there to grab a taxi. No. No one will recognize me like this. Ta da. I'll be going. I'll walk you. It's okay. Bye. Bye. So, why did you start this in the first place? And why are you being dragged around by Kim Kang Mo? Why? Sang Chul. Good job. A really good job. Reporter Baek went to mom and recorded everything she said about you and Kim Kang Mo getting married when the elections are over. What? It's all over now. You know that? Unni, what is he saying? Huh, I guess reporters have to sleep too. Now that it's night, the body feels a little stiff. Oh. Kitty cat. Wow, it's been a long time. We'll be seeing more of each other. I came back home now. Did you see the newspapers, by any chance? I'm getting a divorce. What foolishness am I uttering to you? It's just that it's a little hard for me. Pretending to not struggle is hard. Being away from her is hard. I guess it is difficult after all. Sang Chul. Sang Chul. Mae Hyung. Mae Hyung. Mae Hyung. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You tell me that, I'm so... I am a foolish, too weak hearted person {\a6}and helpless when in love. Ji Soo, why aren't you saying anything? Is something wrong? Mom. {\a6}Because I'm foolish, Yes? In life there aren't only bad things, I'm told. {\a6}you're all that I know Ji Soo, tell me. I can listen to you. I don't know how long it will take but under the square sky, I'll be waiting for you. So, go and return safely. You can't move from that house, okay? Okay. I will never move. Because of you, I have become a naive and foolish person. I am a fool. [Actress Han Ji Soo divorces Goo Dong Baek] See here, Manager Cha! I went on a vacation in a good mood and when I returned, something absurd has happened while I was gone. Aren't you being too much? Now that you have no use for Goo Dong Baek, so you schemed this up to throw him away? So, Han Ji Soo cares only about her image? The fact that Goo Dong Baek is suffering right now, wasn't that because of you to begin with? To worry about Goo Dong Baek now seems a bit ridiculous. That's why, because that's what I felt bad about, I made sure this didn't affect you people. That's why I only made Congressman Kim back out of the elections! What are you saying? You made him give up the election? Not Kang Mo? Aha, so Kim Kang Mo must be claiming that it was his deed? He's certainly the son of that man. I guess the same blood flows in both of them. Tell me definitely, is that the truth? I'm sorry for secretly recording Han Ji Soo's mother, but I took that to Choi Su Yeon, Kim Kang Mo's fianc?. And that is why she broke off the engagement and Congressman Kim gave up on the election. You're saying she broke it off with him? If you don't believe me, go and ask her yourself. Next time you want to drink, don't drink by yourself but call me out to drink with you. Lately, it's getting harder to make it with an unaffected mind. Wow, this soup is really good. What am I going to do if I crave this when I'm in Australia? You're going to Australia? Of course I should go. I need to go back and finish up my studies. I have to think of my life. Right, you do need to study. So you can become someone great. Do you have a passport? Of course I have one, even though I've never had to use it. Why don't you use it? I have to have a reason to use it. Come to Australia. Is it nice there? Of course it's nice. I have a Kangaroo at our house that I ride. I'll loan him to you. You can sightsee around Australia on him. And I thought you were being sincere. Another joke? Seriously, come. Sometime when Dong Baek ahjussi is wilted like a dried up radish, bring him there with you. Wow, this really is very good. Why did you want to come here? Just be quiet and follow me. Uh... rest well. And the press conference tomorrow may be hard but... I'll be going now. Han Ji Soo! What brings you here? Um, that is... tomorrow... I wish you well for the press conference tomorrow. I see. You came here to tell me that? Yes, and... when you go to Canada, be well. Suk Hyun, let's go. Park Kyung Ae! Yes? That I'm going to Canada, who did you hear that from? Sit, sit. No need to get up. Sit. What did they decide about reprimanding him? Uh, they felt so strongly about this, so I don't think we can avoid suspension. How can they suspend him? A divorce is a personal matter. Just because you're a public servant, you can't ever get a divorce? Should all divorced people be fired? I'm upset too! I talked to them until I was blue in the face. I said Goo Dong Baek and the Swallows can't continue without Goo Dong Baek. I told them a divorce is a personal matter. They feel the integrity of a public servant's position is compromised. Damn it all. Postmaster, with this suspension, I could also be fired, right? So why... with such beautiful Han Ji Soo there, you with Park Kyung Ae... aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo. [Letter of Resignation] Hello, I am Han Ji Soo. Before I make my statement, I think you should listen to this person first. Hello, how are you? I am a former employee of Central Post Office, Park Kyung Ae. It's nice to see you. I am here, before all of you, very remorseful. Goo Dong Baek has never once cheated on Han Ji Soo with me. That is the absolute truth. What is this? It wasn't an affair? What is going on here? What the... I don't know how I can ever make up for getting so very drunk and committing this momentary mistake, and then placing the blame on Goo Dong Baek. You may all spit on me and throw stones at me, {\a6}My goodness, that's the apology statement I wrote for her. but I hope all the misunderstanding about Goo Dong Baek can be cleared. Hah! That's not what's important here. What's important is Goo Dong Baek didn't cheat! Park Kyung Ae said. She's saying oppa didn't do that. Here, let me help you with that. Thank you. Goo Dong Baek! Then what is this? Didn't you call press conference to announce your divorce? Are you saying you're not going to divorce Goo Dong Baek, Han Ji Soo? Goo Dong Baek is a person that says between people, there shouldn't be transactions but rather relationships. He knows how to clear up a mind that's all muddled. And he taught me that to be happy, I have to smile no matter what. He also made me realize that in life, there aren't only bad things. Then are you saying you will divorce Goo Dong Baek? Goo Dong Baek and I had a contract marriage. We agreed to fake a marriage for 6 months, until the Mayoral elections are over. Why did you do that? I was in an illicit relationship with someone. There was a reporter that found out about that, and in trying to flee from him, we got into a car accident. And that's where I met Goo Dong Baek. Goo Dong Baek, at that time, willingly helped me out of a desperate situation. And he also agreed to enter into this contract marriage. How can she...? Why didn't noona come with you? Mom. Oh... Noona asked me to tell you she's sorry. What's been going on with noona is... A contract marriage isn't an option we should have taken. I will gladly accept your criticisms. However, Goo Dong Baek is faultless. All he did was help me out, in a very difficult situation. And in return, he received only 9 autographs from me. Is she joking? Is she playing with us? What? You really expect us to believe that for 9 signatures, he would agree to do this? Would that make sense to you? I know it's hard for you to believe because I reacted just like that myself, at first. But that's just who Goo Dong Baek is. Han Ji Soo, if what you're saying is true, then there's still 1 month left of the contract. What is the reason you're revealing this all of a sudden? The first button was mismatched so the rest of the buttons wouldn't match up right. I want to undo all the buttons and button up correctly from the beginning. The reason is because every day I've spent with Goo Dong Baek was happy. It's because I love... Goo Dong Baek. Before the marriage, we prepared the divorce papers in advance. These, right here, are those papers. But... Are we playing a game here or what? We will not be getting a divorce. Hey! What are you doing? Han Ji Soo, you've lied to an entire nation. So how can you be confessing to that and still sit there and smile? That's because I have to smile... for Goo Dong Baek to smile. I'm very sorry. Even if many people point their fingers at me, I will continue to smile for him. I just now found out how to be happy. If a person like Goo Dong Baek were to stay by my side, I think I can continue to be happy and smile. I'm sorry. To all the people watching this press conference, I want to say I'm sorry. And to all the reporters gathered here, thank you. {\a6}and my feet, full of thorns, hurt with each step I take. {\a6}But I am one step closer to you today than yesterday. Han Ji Soo! {\a6}Yes, it's alright. {\a6}I believe, I believe in you, my love {\a6}You who could put your hand over my aching heart. {\a6}I believe, I believe in you, the breath of my life. Goo Dong Baek, listen to me carefully. {\a6}I believe in you, the only one that can hold me. Okay. We're going to get married. I'm sorry but you have no choice in the matter. {\a6}Fortunately, Even if you don't want to, you still have to. {\a6}All this will pass. Because all this... {\a6}Even though I try and hold you here, is because of you. {\a6}there is no wind that can stop in one place. Why aren't you answering? {\a6}I know that after a long rain, there is a rainbow. Don't you want to? It doesn't matter, since I told all the reporters. {\a6}I am one step closer to you today than yesterday. So, you have to, no matter what. {\a6}Yes, it's alright. {\a6}I believe, I believe in you, my love. I think I've heard this once before. {\a6}You who could put your hand over my aching heart. You remember? Yes. {\a6}I believe, I believe in you, the breath of my life. The content is the same but the feeling is different. {\a6}I believe in you, {\a6}the only one that can hold me. What should we do about your third wish that I couldn't grant? {\a6}I hope, then hope again, though it brings pain Then, I will tell you my third wish again. {\a6}Not one day, not one thing do I regret. Han Ji Soo, please pull on my tie. {\a6}Because I am grateful for everything you gave to me. That is my wish. {\a6}They're all sweet, even the tears. Your third wish is also for me. I believe, I believe in you, my everything. the one that gave me the reason to breath. You relieve, you relieve my deepest pain, because you're the only one that can heal that pain. I believe, I believe in you, my love. Even if you were hurting, you still smiled at me. I believe, I believe in you, the breath of my life. I believe in you, my last love. Now, actress Yoo Jae Hee and Sportsman Ha Min Woo were reported to be caught kissing at A club. Could they really be a couple? No, it's all for show. My antennae lets me know that it's not. For their new movie, they schemed this up for publicity. Trust in my sensitive antennae as I knew right away that Han Ji Soo's marriage was a fake. Ah, speaking of which, today is Han Ji Soo's real wedding. It's a private ceremony but since we're of the same agency, I was invited and will be attending. Are you jealous? Well then, it's been the Antennae girl, Park Kyung Ae. Cut! Good job. Good job. Suk Hyun, aren't we late for the wedding? No. When am I going to get to the "star" land. Noonim. They sent a van for you today. Oh! Really? Really? Bride and Groom, enter! Groom Goo Dong Baek, will you take Han Ji Soo as your bride and love her forever? Yes. Then, Bride Han Ji Soo, will you take Goo Dong Baek as your husband and love him forever? Yes~! She said yes~. I now pronounce you man and wife, REAL man and wife. Next will be the bride and groom's march. Bride and Groom, march. I won't take the pictures while hiding today. Fine. Take all the pictures you want. Congratulations. Hey, how many times is my brother marrying the same woman? Ug, I couldn't go through it 3 times. Noona is very happy right now. I can tell by her voice. Hey Antennae girl, it seems you're becoming teeny bit popular lately. The employees even know about you. It's not just a teeny bit Team Manager. I'm very popular. They sent a van today. Give me a ride in your van. Me too, me too! Me too. No. That's so annoying. Suk Hyun. Really! Mom, Mae Hyung wore the same suit today that he wears everyday. So what? Anything looks good on Dong Baek. Ji Soo too. Anything looks very pretty on you. Ah, is that so? Yes, that is so. How can a political photo journalist be going around taking pictures of celebrity weddings. Don't be too harsh on me. Living up to my political photo journalist duties, I've cast my ballot before coming here. Now, unni. Throw the bouquet in my direction. 7 o'clock spot. 7 o'clock? Okay. I'm going to try and catch it too. Move out of the way. Ladies, get ready. This bouquet will do two and a half turns with a twist. Oh, Ji Soo. When I say, "throw it", then throw it. Okay. Okay then, "Throw it". Things are falling right into place. Ji Soo, it's me. I'm on my way to the airport. I'm feeling relieved, and at peace. I wonder if it's because I plan on only focusing on studies for a while. Thinking back, I see how poor I was. Not because of money but because I wanted too much. Be happy, always. Congratulations on your wedding. Ji Soo. Kang Mo wanted to congratulate us. That was nice of him. Let's listen to the quartet song. They all look so happy. It feels so good. Don't they shine in your eyes? Those people? I remember something my father used to say. Those twinkling lights aren't only stars in the night sky. He said they are also people that live on this earth. He said person by person, each shine as well. Wow, that means we're all stars. Yes and among them, you are the brightest. At least to me. Just for you to keep that in mind. Okay, I'll be sure to keep that in mind. The 6 months that I had wished would pass in the blink of an eye, changed all of us. In that time, it feels like each one of us grew as much as an open palm. And the happiness that we just looked upon...
