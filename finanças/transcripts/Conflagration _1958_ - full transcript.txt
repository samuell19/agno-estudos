Maizuru City... the son of a small temple priest His father died 7 years ago... His mother works Did you do it alone? Protecting someone? You can't even die. Don't be funny You can't fool the police A full-scale investigation is going to begin Our Chief's here, too, so you'd better confess Mizoguchi, silence won't make the sentence lighter You, of all people... should know Shukaku Temple was a national treasure! You knew how important the building was! Confess like a man! What's his mental state? A slight split personality. Nothing serious Why are you silent? You haven't said a word since your arrest You needn't, under postwar law, but how did you know that? SOEN TEMPLE To the Most Reverend Tayama... Street cars stopped... terrible walking - Good morning. Who's he? - He came to see Priest Tayama Kengen Temple... Oh, Priest Mizoguchi's son? You've grown up Came 3 years ago, didn't you? I'm awfully busy Sorry I can't be more accommodating Ouch! The rice-gruel is boiling over! Excuse me Good morning Allow me please Excuse me Sorry to disturb your meal, but... would you read this? Mizoguchi's son brought it Mizoguchi's son? Has he gone? He's outside - Let him in. - Breakfast? It doesn't matter Come on in I'm glad you've come Is your father well? I've neglected writing to him Then, your father did not recover? I didn't know his father died. I'm very sorry to hear it It is a sad thing This has become his last letter to me - Tuberculosis? - Almost a lifelong illness Good people die early A good man. He worshipped Shukaku He said there was nothing more beautiful We should appreciate it more He must've wanted to see Shukaku again before he died I'll offer prayers for him later I'll take care of you. Stay here. - What? But you can't! - He entrusted the boy to me That may be so, but... You may go! What're you doing? Shukaku. You can't really see it from here. Haven't I been put in charge of this temple's business affairs? Then, please tell me before bringing people in! - He's an exception to... - I know that very well and how kind-hearted you are! Then what about my son? I've asked for years that you let him become a novice You haven't married, so you have no son A novice will succeed you. Do you consider my son ineligible? I'm sorry to have shouted I wasn't thinking Namba received his draft notice, yesterday Only the old and very young remain I don't even consider a successor now If I find no suitable successor from among my novices... I shall return this temple to the headquarters If it's a gift, give it to Tenza Idiot! It'srice! It's wasteful! A stutterer? No wonder he's been so quiet. It's pretty bad - Isn't that your classmate? - Yes, his name's Mizoguchi Come with us. An alumnus has come to visit - Say something. Are you dumb? - He stutters A stutterer? Join the navy. I'd correct it in a single day No, my home's a temple. I'm going to be a priest - Forget about him! Let's wrestle! - Okay. I'll coach you These are awfully important. Watch them Let's go. He stammers badly Not when I read the sutra A priest must do more, though... He must lecture and visit homes And act as a guide. Don't be so absent-minded. Help pick up the rice. Namba, are you taking the night train? No, the noon train, if he's to enter the army tomorrow I've packed already Work hard for our country. No rice-gruel in the army. No rice, so we all have to eat it. There used to be more than 10 novices. Now the garden's gone to weed. He's taking Namba's place, but he's still a boy. Is no one here? - And my assistant? - He went to the city office To transfer Namba out and Mizoguchi in. He acted very busy and bumped into a post going out I see. What about Namba? He's bidding his neighbors farewell. Tsurukawa's at school. Here. I'll give you 10 sen Go 'round back next time Working already? Even people living in temples aren't all Buddhas. Understand? Consider this your father's temple and do your best. Your father and I were old friends, so feel free with me. Kyoto's in a terrible state A shame the way they're pulling down good houses. - Your place, too? - No, not in the country. But it's near the Naval Base, so we have air raids. Can't even till the fields. Tokyo's in ruins... soon they'll raid Kyoto, too They wouldn't dare burn down a precious temple like Shukaku I'm sorry I didn't send something for the new year to thank you for taking care of my boy. It's about time he got back from school Schools have been mobilized. Students are working in factories. A waste of school fees I'm grateful that he's well. Someone's here... Visitors? That's unusual. I'll go and see. I'm Mizoguchi's mother. Thank you for being kind to him. What fine beans! Are they from your garden? These are sesame seeds. These are beans. This is dried seaweed. This is dried fish. And this is rice. A bit of everything: a poor offering. - What lovely presents. - It's nothing Sorry to trouble you We're back. Mizoguchi, your mother is here. He's a willful boy. My husband died one and a half yeras ago today. So long, already? If you'd read the sutra for him, my husband would be glad. Gladly. To the main hall, then. Come with me. We owe you very much. But I can only afford a poor offering. Oh, the sirens again. We have air-raids alerts every day, too. I was scared, so I sent the visitors away. One mustn't make fun of alerts. And the assistant? Around. I guess. Timid, but he's absorbed in the temple. His one good point. You ignored your mother because of the others? Happy? No, I'm not. I miss my mother. Our temple's in Tokyo, but father arranged for me to train here I don't like him much. Were you afraid of yours? You were sad, then, when he died, weren't you? You were, that's why you look sad. Everyone laughs when I stutter, but you don't Me? I don't mind. I'll go clean. Shukaku again? No visitors come, and it could burn up. You must have a heart of gold to do it. Goichi, where are you? It's an air raid! What're you doing here? Don't come in! You mustn't! It's awful if there's no place to hide. There is. I'm not afraid at all at home. But it's terrible in a strange place. Going home? Yes, I only came to have the sutra read to father but I can't go to the temple, it's someone else's now. What? Someone else's? Father... Mother... What is it? - Kurai and Mother...! - Don't say anything Goichi, I'll take you to see Shukaku soon. I promise. It nestles in the lap of the Kyoto mountains There's nothing more beautiful than Shukaku. I forget this filthy world just thinking about Shukaku. I know why you sold the temple! You hated father! What're you saying? Your father was sick a long time; it was mortgaged. I'm going to my parents' home. Keep your father's memorial tablet Understand, you have no temple or home. Gain the priest's favor, then you'll succeed him I'm looking forward to it. You never know. I might go to war and die. Idiot! It'll mean the end of us if they take stammerers. Don't come here again! - I'm happy just to be here! - Don't go! Stay here! I'd be glad to burn to death with Shukaku! Isn't it beautiful? The first floor's called Kasuiden. The second, Shuindo. Finally, I'm able to show you 5,000 copies more Thanks. Many visitors... Must be a thriving business. You're wrong. It's expensive to get out guidebooks. Heard Priest Tayama has raised the admission. I've heard you make 200,000 yen a month. People are all wrong. We're just a bit better off. We deserve it after the war years. There's a crowd outside. Yes, on Sundays. A weekend. What's that? It's Saturdays and Sundays. I'll be going... Will Priest Tayama be back? - He's at a bank party. - He's changed. I didn't know he was so worldly. Is Mizoguchi helping, too? I couldn't find him. He hates people more and more - I'll help. - Thanks. We must employ more people. You're a brute! Get away from me! What're you doing? Don't you dare defile Shukaku! Excuse me. Oh, it's you, Mizoguchi What is it? There's something I must tell you. Chesterfields... A present? Thanks. I'm so busy lately I can't even give you lectures This is a good time to tell you. I intend to send you to college. I want you to get good grades. You needn't thank me. Just do you very best. Call Tosen for me Won't you tell me? - Are you still worried? - Tsurukawa! Okay. I'll tell you... Everyone's jealous of you. Because Chief Priest Tayama is sending you to college. That's not all, is it? Priest Tayama avoids me, too. I don't want to worry you Then there is something! I heard... A strange woman came The week before she'd visited Shukaku with a G.I... and a novice knocked her down, so she said to pay up or she'd sue Upon hearing that the novice had stuttered. Chief Priest paid her. and forbade us to discuss it further. - I knocked her down! - You're lying! I can't believe it... What was the reason? - She tried to enter Shukaku. - Then? - Nothing. - Nothing? I couldn't stand it! She laughed at your stutter, didn't she? Tell the truth. You should've apologized right away. Want me to? - I will, myself. - Yes, as soon as possible. Is she alive? I wonder she's like a doll You're late. - Why'd you come? - Why? Because it's been two years. Sit down, will you? I hear they're sending you to college. I cried when I heard it. Could anything be better? At my parent's home, both of my parents died long ago And it's gotten harder to live in the country. The Priest said I could work here and gave me a room. You thank him for me, too. - I said not to come! - I know. You didn't want to see me till you're a full-fledged priest But I have to eat, so try to bear it, dear. You don't understand! Is that everything? My mother's very ill. Hurry back to her. Tenza, go to the station, too. He'll see you safely there. Streetcare fare I hope he's on time. - Did you see your mother? - Yes. I must tell you about the tobacco and about that girl I know! I did my duty as the priest in charge of Shukaku. Shukaku...! Don't make excuses. I am disappointed I didn't think you'd be one to apologize after the harm's done. Are you following me? No! So what do you want? Just to ask you to explain some points in the lecture... points I don't understand Don't stammer so much! You don't want my help I know why you spoke to me You're Mizoguchi? I've been waiting. But I don't want friends. My foot keeps them away, anyway. I wondered when you'd dare We'd only spotlight your fault all the more Go on, stutter till everyone in Kyoto knows Then you'll know peace. So, you think you've found a good companion? Right? You were interested in college at first. You got good grades. You grew lazy in the 2nd year. And now you'll probably flunk. Want to know why I know so much? Not only you Sports are out for me, so I have time. So I sit and watch people - Why not go to school? - No fun at school. Hah! No fun anywhere. What do you do? I visit temples. Why visit other temples? To see if any other temple is lovelier than Shukaku Why? They're merely buildings that escaped bombing They don't change Idiot! People, history, and morals all change. Everything does Your precious Shukaku, too... Ants could eat it or fire burn... I'll teach you... watch the change in a stuck-up girl Follow me! Jump! Leaving me here? It's your fault I've fallen! You're so beautiful, I didn't watch where I jumped! What should I do? Someone here? What are you doing? A new novice is coming tomorrow Tsurukawa... Thinking of Tsurukawa? Sitting here won't bring him back He's gone. Don't waste electricity. Goichi, where are you going? To the Garden! Goichi, come to my room! Why don't you go to school? I was told to give you a good talking to By the Chief Priest? No, he's too nice. The assistant told me What makes you act in such an ungrateful way? Your father would grieve if he knew Put yourself in my place. You're cared for, and I'm working, too. I'm humiliated. Go, then. What're you saying? Don't stutter! Mother, do you make fun of me, too? I didn't intend to I worry a lot, feel small, and work without any fun at all. It's all to see you become Chief Priest here before I die. And you're telling me to leave. I'm unhappy, so I stutter. Yes, when you learn you're alone and live in despair Then words don't come easily. I wasn't born a stutterer. I was raised in a poor, cold temple. Father was consumptive. I'm sure Father felt as I did. That's why he spoke of Shukaku every day. Thinking of it made him forget the long, lonely days. Shukaku was his dream. He wanted me to relive his dream so he sent me here. But... but you had to come. You don't want me to be here because I look miserable? Mother, I know! About Kurai and you A stutterer can't become Chief Priest. I'm satisfied just to be near Shukaku. Go to bed. It's late. Fool! Are you spying on me? Who is it? Oh, it's you. I thought it was Mizoguchi. Where is he, so late? - Thanks. - I counted the admission fees. - 5,800 yen. - Good. Good night. I'll be going now. - Now? - Is something... Please, tell me if something is bothering you. Do you remember... I said if couldn't find a suitable successor... I'd return my temple to the headquarters? But I realize now that I'm not suitable, either. You're wrong. Soenji's success is due to you. That's the problem. I must be worldly to manage a temple like this. I feel I've strayed from the path of Buddhism by being Chief Priest. Meaning? - I should resign. - That's ridiculous. - All priests keep a mistress or two. - Never mind others. I respect you very much. I felt bitter towards you about my son, but he has a shop now. He's a born shopkeeper, so I'm impressed by your foresight. You're too wise for you own good. If you resign from this temple, I will, too. I don't know how I'll live. I don't want to trouble you or others. I'll think it over. What now? You bother me. Haven't you any other friends? Yes, one, but he died two years ago. A truck ran him over. He was kind. I won't die. Those who do are weak in some way. People with guts don't die easily, like your priest. Know him? I come from a temple, too, so I know rich priests. He took a Gion geisha recently for his mistress. A lie! Didn't you know? Hey, the Hibachi! You can buy pictures of her at Gion. I'll show you one. No! Not interested? I won't, then. She's pretty, modern-looking the type old men like. He's changed. Everything has. Men who live by the Precepts easily fall prey to money. You seem to respect him, but the deformed are easily fooled. A little kindness and they're easily taken in. Hypocrites! They aren't deformed, but others feel superior. The Priest was kind to you? - At first. - But not now? See? A real priest wouldn't change. He acted out a lie from the first. I don't believe it. You're so very na?ve. All right, then do the thing he hates the most. If he's all that you think he is, he'll do some soul-searching, and become kind again. Staying longer? About time for the girl to come. - Sorry, I'll go. - No, stay, and have some fun. I'll show you the hypocrisy that passes for kindness. She's that girl... her home is in front of the school. Hello. A guest? I'll come later. You know him Oh, your friend. Why did you leave him and run? You're no friend. It was hard to help him. He was hurt. I'll introduce you... She is Miss Wanibuchi. Be kinder to him after this. Still hurts? I'm sorry. I'll fix it. I was to blame! I'm sorry! Strange, but it gets well when you do that You're a saint. No, I'm not. Mizoguchi, get my furoshiki. A keepsake from my uncle who died... a shakuhachi. This is mine. Then you play it? I don't need two, so you take the keepsake. Nice to play when you're worried. Go on, take it. Friendship between men is nice. I'm envious. Like this. It's simple. Excuse me. I touched on it in my lecture, about the Nanchuan cat. This has always been considered a very difficult catechism. A cat once strayed into a quiet temple the priests fought to catch it. Priest Nanchuan killed it, with a sword And by this merciless deed, he quelled the fighting priests. He explained what had happened to his high disciple, Chao Chou. And asked his opinion. His disciple put his shoes on his head and left. The priest was sad. For the cat would not be dead if Chao Chou had been there. - Excuse me! - Who is it? Mizoguchi! I meant to make you my successor once But I have no such thought now. It's a lie! Not a stutterer like me! Fool! Has it ever bothered me? You've a warped mind! You know all about me. But I believe I know you, too. So? Knowing without understanding means nothing. So? Knowing without understanding means nothing. Lend you 3,000 yen? Whatever for? This is your collateral? I have a dictionary. And the shakuhachi is the one I gave you I may lend you the money, but what's it for? Speak up! Your stuttering's past remedy. Be careful... you're safe as long as you stutter. It gets so you can't express yourself. You become dumb and clam up, till you go crazy, or commit suicide, or kill someone. - I want to travel. - Where? Coming back? I can't, if you're not even sure. I will come back. Very well, put your seal to this I.O.U for 3,000. Thumb print will do. The interest is 10% per month. Cheaper than a moneylender. Next time the priest's away, let me play flute in Shukaku. Can you play it yet? - Just noise. - That's fine. Go ahead. Blow on it! Your music doesn't stutter I gave it to you to hear music stutter Like the last guest... He's been in his room for 5 days. He doesn't eat much and just sits. Excuse me. You registered under your real name? The address, Soen Temple, means you're a priest. You don't look like one. Kotani College... I see, you're a student. It's you all right. Thanks. Do they know you're here? No. School's not out yet. What're you doing here? Don't do anything foolish There may be times when you feel like dying But you don't seem desperate Many people want to study but can't But you have a promising future You thankless, ungrateful boy! Have any money? How could you come back! Who will you apologize to? Acting crazy... out of spite to me? I was so worried about you... You hoped I'd die, didn't you? I'm so ashamed, I can't stay here - Where will you go? - I don't care what happens to you! Die, for all I care! I wish I hadn't borne you. You like tormenting me! The Priest's mistress... she's with child? Who said so? Keep still. He's upset. Why? Your son is back? I'm a cripple, so excuse me. Please look at this It's Mizoguchi's I.O.U. from 5 months ago. I reminded him, but he won't pay. It's comes to 4,500 now. It'll get harder for him to pay, so would you pay? I thought I'd hold the temple responsible. I also need the money. Hello? Hello? Our fire alarm is out of order. Please come right away. The sooner the better. This evening? Thanks. You're back? Know Mr. Togari? He's in with the priest. Did you find your mother? No The Priest is calling you. Is this your thumb print? Yes. - The interest is 1,500... - No interest on student loans. Excuse me If you repeat this behavior, you can't stay here Knock before you come in! Sorry about my behavior earlier. No offense. You forced me into it by not paying me. Your priest is a tightwad. He's rolling in money, but wouldn't pay interest. What's that? Interest. You're odd. Why didn't you pay up, if you had it? He gave me my school fees. Won't you need it? What of the priest who paid your debt, then your fees? He's a hypocrite, or he's testing you. Show his true colors by spending the money You have guts. There's nothing to fear by it. No I saw Shukaku for the first time... It's lovelier than I imagined. Wonderful to own one. A big garden, and the pond is fine. It's a national treasure, so the money rolls in Shukaku's different. You wouldn't understand. I wouldn't? Do you? What's it to you? You're only a novice in the priest's charge. You can't get along elsewhere. I'd understand if that's why you like Shukaku - You're wrong! - Why? Hurry up and tell me! Stutter! Not ashamed to now, are you? Even this knows you stutter! Shukaku belongs to no one. Not the priest's It was there from the beginning, and was always beautiful. They're using it to make money But Shukaku won't change You said all living things change. Shukaku's alive, but it won't! I won't let it! Such confidence. You won't let it change? Hah! No. I came to tell you so What can you do? She's not Miss Wanibuchi The girl from the big house? You've been seeing her, too! I knew it! She's a teacher She teaches me flower arranging, and is very vain You're a monster! I saw you once a long time ago Where? Wanibuchi married. I chased her away from me. She became suffocating. The same is true for you You said I arranged flowers well, didn't you? You can't teach me any more, so I don't need you Brute! What are these flowers, anyway? Want to know what I was laughing at? At two crippled men talking nonsense! Get out! The other girl thought so, too! Pride over kindness! No cripples for me! Don't, or I'll break your neck! Proud to be a cripple? Who'd even notice if you weren't? Get out! First time here? From a temple? - How'd you know? - I could tell by your hair cut Many come You look depressed. Broken heart? Scolded by the priest? By your mother? I'm lonely You shouldn't come here. You seem nice What if Shukaku burned down? Shukaku? I've never been there - Would you be surprised? - It doesn't matter, does it? It'd be terrible if this place burned, I have 3 years to go You stutter... can you read the sutra? Yes, the sutra and English Read this, then You can, can't you? You've a nice voice, too It'd be nice to have you read the sutra - Bye. I'll leave. - Why? Don't waste your money Never mind It really is your first time, isn't it? Come again... I'm Mariko Sorry to have you go like this. Thank you. - Salty. - Is it? - Where do I put his bed? - He won't use it yet. Lay it in the hall Is the fire alarm... repaired? Not yet It's not safe. I asked them to fix it He drinks a lot Priest Zenkai is notorious as a heavy drinker... More sak?! Come in Mizoguchi's son. So he's Mizoguchi's... You take after him. We were friends since training days. He was mischievous. It's a pity he died so young He's attending Kotani College, and is very diligent. That's great - Telephone. - Who is it? Excuse me. Who'd phone now? Yes? It's a boy! A boy was born! I said not to call I'm sorry, but this is different. Mistress is happy to give you an heir. She said to call She's alright. Your father's temple was at Naryu, wasn't it? I went once It's nice place jutting out into the Sea of Japan The waves are breathtaking What do you think of me? You seem like a nice, serious student An ordinary student? Being ordinary is best. No one doubts you that way. Please judge me! I'm not what you think Please see the real me! I don't need to. It's best not to think No one understands me! No one understands I've only one thing left to do No one understands me Who is it? Why were you following me? Why did you have to? It's too late! It won't do you any good to get mad! He's acting crazy What's going on? What is it? Not a fire? It's too late. Buddha's judgement! You won't speak	? Even so, the investigation will proceed. You'll be indicted when we have proof You burned a national treasure What was your reason? Did you just suddenly do it? Have you considered your mother? Your mother comes every day She's praying you'll confess and become a good boy You've committed a hideous crime, so she's ashamed to see you. Doesn't it bother you to do that to her? Think hard on it No amount of money can bring back what you've burned. It probably won't affect the tourist trade, though. How much will it cost to rebuild? - Millions. - It's hard to say We can't waste our time on him Ready to go? He's the one that burned Shukaku. His mother killed herself. Read about it two months ago. - The verdict? - 7 years. The Chief Priest's helping - He requested another trial. - He shouldn't have. They should have left it alone Toilet?
