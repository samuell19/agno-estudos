YOU'LL FEEL IT, SEE IT, HEAR IT AS THOUGH IT IS REAL AND HARD-EDGED. HEH. IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND. YOU KNOW, MR. PIETROV, I WAS A LOT LIKE YOU IN MY YOUNGER DAYS. I WAS CONSUMED WITH ACADEMICS. I HAD NO SOCIAL TRAINING. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MEET WOMEN. AFTER I BECAME A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN I WENT THROUGH A SERIES OF PRICY AND DISASTROUS RELATIONSHIPS, AND THEN I GOT MARRIED AND HAD HALF MY LIFE TAKEN AWAY BY A BITTER DIVORCE. REALLY? W-WHY-- WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL THIS? WELL, MR. PIETROV, OUT OF MY DESPAIR, I CREATED HYPNOTIKA, A MIND-ALTERING TECHNIQUE THAT REMOVES ALL OF THE TROUBLES FROM RELATIONSHIPS. NO MORE EXPENSIVE DATES THAT END WITH JUST A PECK ON THE CHEEK. NO MORE WHINING AND CRYING OVER FORGOTTEN ANNIVERSARIES OR BIRTHDAYS. NO CHEATING, NO PREGNANCIES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NO MORE WONDERING IF YOU'RE GONNA GET TO FIRST BASE, BECAUSE NOW EVERY ENCOUNTER IS GUARANTEED TO BE A HOME RUN. HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT?
