ANIMAL SOUTH POLO Wow, how strange. Tamara Albertis wore the same necklace again. And the same dress, too, I think. “A woman is a fully—ﬂedged active rebel. But there‘s something more. According to the fables, the chronicles, and the stories, she is furious... cruel and bloodthirsty.” Put things in perspective, Alberto. All ofthat was written by men. “The blood that is spilt with every moon is the enemy ofman... a symbol ofthe stain and impurity ofthe female body... which prevents him from entering the desired womb.” |don‘t get it. I should get away from the magazine and devote myself... entirely to painting. You can do both, Natalie, as always. This is a wonderful photo of Yuyo Taylor. Prince Philip looks very cute. What‘s out there? Nothing.Asheep. Alberto. — Alberto! — I‘m sorry. I think I‘m going to bed. Areyou coming? Go ahead. I‘ll be right there. Alberto! FREIGHT — Morning, boss. — Morning, Miranda. Excuse us. Miranda! Put that sheep aside. Excuse me? I said put that sheep aside. What were you doing out ofthe pen last night? Miranda, I want her in the barn. Darling, I‘m the director. |fthey‘re in every issue... it‘s because they‘re the best. And as long as they‘re the best... and as long as the public agrees, they will be in every issue. Okay? Agreed? I cannot believe it. They can‘t do a thing without me. Alberto. Don‘t you know what day it is? Yes, Tuesday. What‘s wrong with you? — Nothing, why? — You‘re acting strange. You didn‘t sleep last night. Nowyou sit here all morning looking at— Is something wrong? Nothing‘s wrong, Natalie. I‘m resting my eyes. Aren‘t you going to paint today? Alberto, today is our anniversary. Oh, dear. It‘s our 29th wedding anniversary. | forgot. Congratulations, dear. Oh, cufflinks. Thankyou, Natalie. Thanks a lot. You‘re welcome, dear. And I‘m sorry. I don‘t know what‘s wrong with me. I‘m distracted. It‘s the ﬁrst time in 29 years that I‘ve forgotten. I thought we could go to town this afternoon. It‘s been a long time. We could have some tea under the sun, go shopping... like when we were young... and full ofdreams. Do you remember our dreams? How people... would tilt their heads when they saw us go by. What do think ofthe plan? I love it. Great. DRAWING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN What‘s that smell? Yes, I loved it. Excuse me? Your painting, it‘s your best, Natalie. Thanks, dear, but I said something else. Did you wash your hands? What have you been handling? You smell funny. Ijust showered. Nevertheless, that smell is coming from you. You wouldn‘t dare— How can you think that, Natalie? I never did. And I wouldn‘t today, on our anniversary. Especially not in bed. Come on, Natalie. So? I don‘t know. Maybe my metabolism is changing. Your metabolism? His metabolism. Good night, darling. Good night. Sleep well, Natalie. What is itwith you? What is itwith you? What did you do to me? My God. What am I saying? My God. Did you have breakfast? —Good morning, dear. — Hello. —You‘re up early. —I slept like a baby. I‘m starving. Shall we eat? It‘s a beautiful, clean, warm day with blue skies. | wish every day ofthe year were like this. | feel wonderful, full ofenergy. I could eat a halfdozen scrambled eggs. No, please. Excuse me. I‘ll do that. Thanks. Wouldn‘t you rather call the maid? | just ﬁred her. Excuse me? Natalie, we‘re not useless. |n Buenos Aires we have an army ofmaids that won‘t even let us pull up a chair. That has to stop. We spend two months a year here at the ranch. I want to do things myself. | feel younger when I make breakfast, water the plants. It‘s like myjoints get oiled. You‘re crazy. And I‘m glad. Does this new situation mean... that I‘ll have to make the beds and wash the dishes? No, nothing like that. |wi|| do everything. |don‘t want you doing anything that you don‘t feel like doing. Let‘s not get carried away. Why would the boss save you? He even laid out a blanket foryou. What‘s going on? Is the boss doing you? What eyes you‘ve got. Well. |fthe boss, a rich man, is doing you... a nobody like me can do you too. Miranda. Sir. What are you doing here? The pitchfork. The pitchfork is outside, and you should be too. Now. At once. — Yes, sir. — Go on. Hi. Did you sleep well? What did thatjerk say to you? Look, I brought you something. Look. Oh, Fanny, ifyou only knew. Don‘t get me wrong, please, I beg you. I‘m not interested in sex. I‘m interested in love, Fanny. I‘m getting used to the idea ofloving you so fast... that I should tell my wife everything and let the chips fall where they may. But, no, that‘s impossible. It would destroy her. Your eyes are more beautiful... than those ofall the species in the world put together, Fanny. No, not now. It‘s impossible. No, Fanny, someone may come in. Look at this fantastic ass! Stumpy, it stinks like balls in here. You ever open the windows? What tookyou guys so long? — Nacho‘s radiator got busted. —We‘rejust in time. Yes. Move over. — Let‘s go! — Go on! — Come on, Stumpy. — Don‘t call me Stumpy. — Let‘s go, you idiot. — Go on. Falling asleep is the last thing I wanted. They could have caught us. It would have been terrible. Well, don‘t worry. Nobody will ever ﬁnd out. Don‘t be surprised ifone day | tell the truth to the whole world. | wish I had the guts. Wait for me. I‘ll have dinner with her, put her to bed... and then I‘ll be back. Wait for me. "Alberto, / looked all over for you. Where were you? Ros/ta Re yna/ cal/ed. Her husband is on .3 mp. 5/7e ’5 alone and in v/z‘ed me to dinner. / thought it was a good idea, so Isa/dyes. Don ’t worry if/ come home late. I’m taking the Mercedes. Natal/e. ” Oh, baby. you‘re so delicious! — Look at the fat one over there. — Where? Where? She has plenty ofcurves. We can try to pick her up. — High—grade merchandise tonight. — Prime. This night is mine. Mine. Hey, Stumpy. Don‘t tell me you like that. — That‘s not right. — Another sheep, man. Listen, one time a cousin ofmine— — With a sheep? —I swear to God. — You sure it wasn‘t you? — No, are you crazy? Have you ever done it with a sheep? They say you have to stick both of its back feet in your rubber boots... so when the critter has both feet in... it moves like this, the critter goes like this... and you fuck her. You should learn. Hello, ladies. Shall we? Well, anyway... my childhood was normal .. but very happy. Well, it‘s time for bed. To think that a couple ofweeks ago, loving you would‘ve seemed impossible. Now, leaving you seems impossible. Rest well. And ifyou can‘t sleep... count “little Albertos.” Don‘t try to fool me. It was a badjoke and I know it. Hey, cut it out. Nice muscles, Miranda. — Good—bye, Stumpy. — Don‘t call me Stumpy. Son ofa bitch! Bastard! Leave her alone! Boss, she called me. —Shut up. —I didn‘t want to. —I got back from the club— — Shut up, youjerk. Shut up. Oh, boss. I lost my head, boss. I told you to shut up. — It‘s a sheep. Doesn‘t feel a thing. — You think she‘s oblivious, you brute? Didn‘t you hear her desperate cries? You pig! Animal! She didn‘t want it, Miranda... and you raped her. — It‘s a sheep. — She‘s my sheep! She‘s mine and I love her! I love her with all my heart. You can‘t compare with one of her curls. You‘re nothing, less than nothing. Yet you raped a creature who cannot defend herself... but for the intervention of my love. You deserve to die. Boss. |thinkyou had more drinks than I did. What did he do to you? Areyou in pain, Fanny? Did he hurtyou? Areyou in pain? You‘ll be okay. You‘ll be okay. You‘ll be okay soon, my love. You‘ll get better. You‘ll be okay, darling. I promise, you‘ll be okay and we‘ll soon forget about this. I have to go. My wife might be back. Sleep well. I‘ll be back tomorrow. Don‘t think about anything. Natalie? Hello? Hello? Ramiro. Yes. Rehearsing. Mom? What happened to her? See how golden they get. They‘rejust right. You know they‘re right by looking at the color. Now, ifCarmencita brings the brush— We will paint... little eyes. Thankyou, Carmencita. And... a little mouth. Like that. You see? I have a dish... with the ﬁnished scones. Carmencita, please. So you can see how fun this recipe is. Look how cute they are. Perfect for the kids. There you go. The scones. — Darling. What a surprise. —I had to come. —I couldn‘t get through on the phone. — What‘s wrong? — Your mom. — What‘s wrong with Mom? Come. I‘ll tell you on the way. Your brother is with her. Let‘s go. What happened? Hi, Rosita? Hi, how are you? It‘s Alberto. Natalie‘s husband. No, it‘s okay. Rosita, I‘m a little worried. Did Natalie stay over last night? No, never mind. I‘ll take care ofit. Okay, thanks, Rosita. My best to the family. Good night. Thankyou. Police. No scandals. They‘re on theirway up. Are you feeling better? What do you mean “better“? Better? No. Stop, stop. She‘s had about ﬁve. Come in. Good morning. Where is the princess? Let‘s go, princess. Who are you? What‘s going on? Don‘t you believe me? What? What? I told you the truth! What are you doing, traitors? Traitors! Poor Mom. Poor Mom. — We did the right thing, didn‘t we? —Yes. It‘s okay. It‘s okay. Hello, dear. Did you sleep well? Look, I brought you something. Doyou like it? And not a word about yesterday. When we ﬁnish breakfast, I‘ll take you for a ride. Today is a glorious day. We can have a picnic. I have a delicious dish foryou. Do you like this music? My children. What are my children doing here? Dad! Dad! He isn‘t home? Hello. What a surprise. How areyou? What‘s wrong? Something terrible has happened, Dad. What? What is it? It‘s Mom. What happened to your mother? She didn‘t come home last night. Was she in an accident? — Is she dead? — She‘s crazy. — What? — We had her committed. — We came to get you. — I‘m okay. — It‘ll be good for her to talk to you. — She‘s delusional about you. She accuses you ofzoophilia and murder. 0ne monkey wags its tail to another. PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC Listen. The duck is now a dog and it‘s barking. North is that way. Excuse me. Mrs. Natalie? Your children are here. You came to get me out of here. Thank God. No. — What‘s wrong? — The devil! — The devil! — What‘s wrong? —What‘s going on? — Nothing. I know how you feel, Mr. Laprida Dugan. But I thinkfor now, itwould be best ifyou did not visityourwife. We were wrong. We thought ifshe saw you and heard you... her delusions would vanish. But it was just the opposite. I‘ll do whatever it takes for my wife, Doctor. The sacriﬁce will be worth it, Alberto. — Can I call you Alberto? — Yes. And don‘t worry. The best staff in the country is here. They are like a river... coming together next to your wife. Thanks a lot, Doctor. We have to do something. He‘s not doing well. No, he‘s sick with worry. Yes, I know. Maybe we should keep him company... — take care ofhim, be by his side. — Stay at the ranch? Yes. Yes, that‘s a good idea. Kids, I don‘t like the idea ofyou neglecting your duties. I‘m ﬁne. Everything is taken care of. I spoke with Ramiro. It‘s done. — Okay, but— — It‘s not open to discussion. We‘re your children, aren‘t we? SPEED LIMIT 50 MPH — You‘re going over 60 mph. — So? Didn‘t you see the sign? Speed limit: 50. I‘m sorry. And? Yes. There‘s a sheep. But it‘s your garden—variety sheep. What do you mean? Nothing. How weird. You never know what image will trigger this kind ofmadness. |f Mom had seen a bull... she‘d say that Dad was having gay sex with a bull. — Gastén, that‘s awful. — But it‘s true. Poor Dad. The scones are ready. I missed you. Oh, I missed you so. |cou|dn‘t get rid of my kids. They‘ll be here for a couple ofdays. They think| need company. They went to town to buy toothbrushes. It‘ll take them a couple of hours because they can‘t make up their minds. And I want to keep my promise to you. Come, Fanny. Come. ECONOMYAND BUSINESS OIL PRICES RISE Nobody will touch you again. Hang him! Hang him! |think| have a better one. Listen. — Let‘s see. — Dad? There are two ﬁeas shooting up on top ofa dog. And one says to the other, while looking at the sky: “Do you believe there‘s life on other dogs?” — I‘ll be right back. — Okay. Man to man, here‘s a riddle. Green on the outside, red on the inside. Green on the outside, red on the inside. — What is it? — What? A parrot‘s pussy. Are you having fun? Sorry. I‘m sorry. It‘s late for me. I‘m going to bed. Did you see how weird he gets every time that sheep bleats? Yes, and shut up. It‘s like talking to the hangman about the rope. My God. It‘s strange that he keeps it tucked away. I don‘t get it. He said it‘s sick. |fhe lets it loose, the other sheep will attack it. It‘s strange. We have to get rid ofit. Clearly, the topic of cloning has been the focal point of th/s argument Do you really think it’s a step forward? — It Is a step forward —A step forward? It’s an aberration. Cloning this monkey opens up the possibility of cloning humans, Doctor. The aberration would be to think that success at cloning a monkey .. could be adapted to a human being And that’s exactly what you ’re thinking That ’s rhetoric, my dear Doctor. Man is a unique and unrepeatab/e being When you manipulate him, you make him vulnerable. — You objectiij/him. — What are you saying? — You’re in ﬁavorofit. — You’re not listening /’m on/ysaying it’s a step forward / ’m not making any moral judgmen ts. — You’re not listening to me, Doctor. — Don’t "doctor” me. Ho w can you say cloning is a step forward without being in favor of it? You say that you ’re neutral But as the church has very well said.. it’s illusory to claim moral neutrality... for scien tiﬁc research and its applications. Gastén. Let‘s donate the sheep to the university. — It has to disappear. — That‘s exactly what I‘m saying. Listen. “There‘s a madman running around the campus with ﬁve guard dogs. They report that the dogs have killed 12 sheep. They are gray dogs, not very tall and with blue eyes. They are Nazis. They acted fast and with perfect timing. While one ofthem immobilized the prey by the tail... another bit itsjugular and shookit until it died.” How awful! I‘m not taking a sheep in the car all the way to the campus. We‘ll leave it tonight on the highway and it‘ll disappear. No worries. Dad, good morning. — Hello. —Good morning. Did you sleep well? Coffee? Have you seen the caretaker? I‘ve been looking all over for him. — Which one? — The new one. That‘s why I‘m asking which one. We‘ve had two lately. —I didn‘t know. — Ofcourse not. You never come. How would you know? Well, from now on, we‘ll visit more often, we promise. The ﬁrst one, Medina, went to work for the Ortiz family. He didn‘t leave, the Ortizes stole him from me. We have problems. The other one, Miranda, was ﬁred byyour mother. What happened? She found him taking a bubble bath... one afternoon that we came unannounced. — That‘s crazy. — Your mother, bless her heart... wanted to eat him alive. Maybe that‘s why, subconsciously... she blames me for what she, in her madness, wanted to do. Kill him. Dad, I‘m going to the city with Gastén. Do you want to come? Please. Let‘s do some shopping. The fridge is empty. — No, kids,you go ahead. — We‘d like you to come with us. Gastén, I said no. You go ahead. And bring some movies, because the ones on TV are terrible. Okay. Don‘t worry. I‘ll take care ofthat. — Bye, Dad. — Did you see Henry/WHeniy V? Great.just great. Okay, don‘t worry. It‘s difﬁcult. We‘ll be back the day after tomorrow. I‘m ﬁne. There‘s no need. It‘s not open to discussion. We‘ll be back. And we won‘t leave you alone until we‘re sure that you‘re ﬁne. I am ﬁne and you have lots ofthings to take care of. Don‘t worry about us. That‘s right. It‘s time you thought a little bit about yourself. Shall we, Paula? Dad, take care. I will go see Mom tomorrow. I‘ll call you with an update. Paula! Fuck! Fill it up. Shut up. Did you ﬁll it up? — Thankyou. — Thankyou. This place is creepy. Yes, isn‘t it? Let‘s leave it here. Yes, leave it here, but hurry up, |don‘t like this place. Come on. Come, come. Fanny, darling. Darling, where were you? Leave that critter there! Grab it! What‘s going on? No, listen, this sheep is mine. — Lady, let her go. — Shut up or we‘ll eat you, too. — Stop. Let her go, boy. —I told you to leave it! Forget that ass. This one is going home. Come on, guys, come on. Push, push. Have you lost your mind? — We have to go back. — Why? Because we made a terrible mistake. What? We left it on this side ofthe fence. So what? What ifit gets hit by a car? — That would be best. — Best? I‘m not thinking ofthe sheep. Think ofthe accident we could cause. We have to go back. We need to leave it on the other side. Yes. — It was around here, right? — Straight. That way. — Paula! — Did you ﬁnd it? We have to leave immediately! — Why? What‘s wrong? — Immediately! What was it? What did you see? What a terrible night. They left you on the road to San Fernando. What were they thinking? |fthey weren‘t my children, |swear| would kill them. Why do they have to meddle in my life? Who told them I needed help? Why do people want to help those who don‘t need it? What good are people anyway? One rapes you. Others kidnap you. Others want to eat you. My God. Do you realize what you‘ve gone through sinceyou fell in love, Fanny? Could it be that love is not foryou? I have to leave you. Yes. No? We have to go back and get my shoe. No, Gastén. It‘s crazy. It‘s not crazy. Or we have to call the police. When they ﬁnd my shoe with the bodies, they‘ll think itwas me, Paula. — Do you know what you‘re saying? — Ofcoursel do. You‘re the one who doesn‘t understand. We aren‘t going back, and we can‘t report it to the police. Nobody ﬁnds a killer with a shoe. — Even ifyou were the killer. — And what ifthey do? And ifthey have dogs trained for snifﬁng? You live far away. Will they send dogs to sniffthe whole capital? I‘m your sister and I know what I‘m talking about. Don‘t worry. People get killed every day. — And you think they‘ll get you? — What are you saying? |didn‘t kill them, Paula. How awful. Think ofthe scandal. A Laprida Dugan accused ofmurder. God help me. God has helped you. Everything is all right. Don‘t worry. We have more important things to think about. Okay? You know what? Talking with you makes me feel great. Good Lord. I was looking for a footprint and I found a shoe. Give me a handkerchief. “Botticelli.“ Brand new. It could belong to one ofthe victims. We‘d have to be idiots not to solve the case with this. Cinderella. This is going to be very easy. There are two shoe stores in town. What ifhe bought the shoes in another town or in the capital? Don‘t worry, we‘ll check all ofthem. This program is really slow. It takes forever. As the Lordsaid in jeremiah 36 and 37: "Why did you write on it that the king of Bab y/on will come... and will destroy this land.. and will cut oﬁ‘ﬂ’om it man and beast?” Well, it wasn ’t so. That ﬁrst divine exception is joined b y this one: the second great exception. Here they are, man and animal.. holding hands as a sign of lo ve. God be with you His kingdom is wide. Listen to this, Fanny. “It is the super—markets— the stock exchanges in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Wall Street— that distribute the money nowadays. And the super—markets do not ﬁnance civil wars. But they deny countries that engage in wars... investment capital for their development.” I completely agree. The stock market is the new Iron Curtain. Well, the |ron Curtain was— During the Cold War, the entire reign ofthe USSR was called... the Iron Curtain. It was a bunch ofcountries that were always red in the maps. Communist countries. Alberto Laprida Dugan? Well, gentlemen. Tell me, what can I do foryou? A week ago, someone killed an entire family... on the road to San Fernando. A shoe was found at the scene ofthe crime. Our extensive detective work... which consisted in checking more than 700 federal shoe stores... allowing us to narrow down to 25... the number ofshoe stores that carry Botticelli... thereby enabled us to investigate each and every one ofthe buyers... and has brought us here. Soyou‘re guessing I bought a pair of Botticelli shoes? We‘re not guessing. You bought a Botticelli. I don‘t remember. But in any case... I suppose that out ofthe 25 people who bought them... I‘m your ﬁrst stop. No, the last one. Let me see ifl‘ve got this right. Somebody kills an entire family on the road to San Fernando. At the scene ofthe crime, you ﬁnd a shoe, a Botticelli. Then you come to see me because it is possible... — that I‘m the killer? — That‘s right. — Oh, my God. — Do you recognize it? It can‘t be. No, it can‘t. It belongs to my son, Gastén. There must be a mistake. — It‘s notyours? — No, it‘s not mine. Now| remember, I gave it to him as a birthday present. How do we know that‘s true? I‘m telling you that this shoe belongs to my son. Would I lie to you about a thing like that, gentlemen? Excuse me for a minute. I think he‘s telling the truth. He has to be really guilty to accuse his son like that. Maybe not. We don‘t know what this family is like. Well, gentlemen. Anything else I can do foryou? |fyou don‘t mind. Would you? It‘s not his. Are you convinced, gentlemen? Hi, Dad. Let me go. Let me go! Dad! Dad! Let me go! Dad! Daddy! Let me go! We got out ofthat one, darling. Were you afraid? Those were really bad guys. Well, everything turned out okay. |was thinking, Fanny. Am I turning into a pervert? Because, actually, |wou|dn‘t like that. Although, with everything that‘s happened lately... with all ofthis danger— Look. I have an erection. Fanny, | canjust reach up and touch heaven. A heaven of horror. A heaven of horror. Sweetheart. Where are you, sweetheart? It‘s okay. You‘ll be back. Good morning, darling. Look, I brought you something. You‘re hungry. See how beautiful you look. Stay here. I‘ll see who it is. I‘ll be right back. Don‘t move. Good morning, I‘m sorry to botheryou. I haven‘t seen Miranda for a while and I came to look for him. Ayoung lady is driving me crazy asking about him. Ass. We never have visitors. Now, all ofa sudden, everybody comes. Dad! Paula. Dad! Paula, baby. — What‘s wrong? — It‘s awful, Dad. It‘s Gastén. He‘s injail. He went in yesterday and they already raped him. But, is he innocent? Yes, obviously. Why did you let them take him? Paulita, I sent him my lawyer, the best lawyer in the country. Just give it time. Everything will be okay, you‘ll see. — Do you want a cup oftea? — You‘re acting strange. What do you mean strange? As ifyou didn‘t care about a thing. Was it true? Mom was telling the truth. You animal. You brute. Degenerate. Son ofa bitch. We‘ll have to leave, Fanny. This country is not for us anymore. I was thinking that Sitges would be a good place to go. It‘s in Spain, by the Mediterranean. We could start a new life there. Or would you prefer Bahia? Sitges would be better. I have ﬁve million pesos just for me. So we wouldn‘t need to sell the ranch. Those shitheads that are always hanging around here can have it. I have to leave you for a moment. I can ask ifyou want. — But I don‘t really think— — Ask. Mr. Agosti. It‘s |rma. I‘m here with a gentleman... who wants to go to Spain... on the 7:00 ﬁight... with a sheep. On the plane, yes. I already told him that, but not in those words. But he insists. He understands, but insists. He‘s offering $10,000. Excuse me? In the cargo hold. No. Not in the cargo hold, sitting next to me, in the cabin. Tell him I‘ll charter the plane. He‘s offering to charter the plane. Okay. Okay. We‘re very sorry. |fyou had come last week... we would have been able to helpyou. But this week we‘re launching an advertising campaign... about the good things offered by our airline. Too bad, isn‘t it? Fanny, look what I got. A cruise with an Art Deco cabin. Fanny. You cheated on me! Motherfucker! I‘ll skin you alive! Do you hear me? I‘ll skin you alive! Motherfucker! You‘re dead! You‘re dead! What the— Alberto, don‘t. I gave the world to you. I gave you a name. And look what you‘ve done! How did it go? Okay? Go to sleep. Is it nice outside? No, it‘s horrible. Thankyou. Life in the country makes me very hungry. |f| keep eating like this, I‘ll look like a tank. What are you thinking about, Paula? Nothing. Don‘t tell me you‘re backing out. About what? I don‘t know. You‘ve been acting strange for some days now. Hey, we said we‘d move here. So don‘t tell me now that you miss the city or I‘ll be furious. |didn‘t say a thing. But do you want to go back? My brother is doing life. My father is dead. My mother is in a straightjacket. And you ask me that? Okay, I‘ll go check on things. Good morning, Silveyra. — Morning, boss. — How are things? We‘re on our way back to the barn. Nice day, isn‘t it? Are you going to the city? I need a new pitchfork. The one I saw has a broken prong. —Yes, I‘ll get it. — Could you bring me some tobacco? I‘ll get you your tobacco ifyou do a small favor for me. Just say it. — The ram. — What about the ram? Put it aside. — Have a good day. — I‘ll seeyou later. I‘ll put it aside foryou. — What brand oftobacco do you like? — Gavilan. Gavilan. No, hear me out. Listen. There are many cultural centers in the Buenos Aires area. “Arte Libre. Alfonsina Storni. Discepolin. Del Sur. Eternauta. Castelnuovo." What is this? It goes on. “Lola Mora. Spilimbergo. Sebastian Piana. Villa Crespo.julian Centeya.” Do you realize that every single one has events? What do you want? A show in a plaza? Free courses ofanything you think of? I don‘t know. Are there enough people to go see all ofthese? Or everyone who goes is involved and there‘s no one left to watch? — Shall we eat? — Yes.
