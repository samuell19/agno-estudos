A LITTLE GROSS, ISN'T IT? YOU'VE GOT 14 SECONDS TO CHANGE. HOUDINI. (Eileen) BURGUNDY IS A REALLY STRANGE COLOR. IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON YOU. DUNCAN WILL BE RIGHT DOWN. (Jake) THAT'S BALONEY.

(Duncan) HOW IS MY DEAR FAMILY THIS MORNING? YOU'RE EARLY. TRUST ME. (Duncan) MOTHER, YOU LOOK RADIANT, AS ALWAYS. SIT DOWN. CAN I HAVE SOME EGGS? (Brian) I WENT OVER LAST MONTH'S ACCOUNTS, DAD. THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT DOWN. WELL, PEOPLE DON'T EAT AS MUCH IN JUNE. WHO DOESN'T EAT IN JUNE? [Duncan whoops] I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE FIGURES WITH ME, BUT THE DROP WAS SIGNIFICANT. IF YOU DON'T EAT IN JUNE, YOU'LL BE DEAD IN JULY. (Kit) MOM. (Brian) ANYWAY, I THINK WE SHOULD GO OVER THEM. KIT, I HATE TO BRING IT UP AT THIS SUMPTUOUS REPAST, BUT IT LOOKS AS IF YOU'RE DRINKING A GLASS OF PUKE. YOU WOULD KNOW. I'M GOING INTO THE CITY TODAY. I'M LEAVING BRIAN IN CHARGE. (Kit) OH, MAN. WHAT ARE YOU GOING FOR? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DAD. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. OH BOY, WE CAN FUCK AROUND ALL DAY, HUH? HEY, DON'T USE THAT WORD IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER. (Brian) WHAT'S THIS TRIP, DAD? JUST A MEETING. WHAT MEETING? NOTHING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT, I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE MEETING IS. JAKE, THE BLUE TIE, HONEY. DAD, CAN YOU DROP OFF MY ENTRY FORM FOR THE RACE? UM, DAD, BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU HAVE $20 I CAN BORROW? DAD, I REALLY WANNA GO OVER THOSE FIGURES WITH YOU. (Jake) IS THAT IT? ARE THERE ANY MORE REQUESTS? BLUE BRINGS OUT THE COLOR IN YOUR EYES. WHO WANTS THE REST OF THE EGGS? OH, DEAR, SHOULD I? OK, WELL, MAYBE THIS ONCE. WHAT'S THIS BIG MEETING, MOM? OH, IF HE WANTED YOU TO KNOW, HE WOULD'VE TOLD YOU, WOULDN'T HE? YEAH, SO WHAT'S THE BIG MYSTERY? OH, THE BIG MYSTERY IS WHERE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER WERE LAST NIGHT. WELL, THIS IS JUST A GUESS, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT BRIAN WAS OVER AT NANCY TRAINER'S PLACE, AND YOU WERE IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION, COVERED IN YOUR OWN VOMIT. WHAT? MORE HASH BROWNS, DUNCAN?
