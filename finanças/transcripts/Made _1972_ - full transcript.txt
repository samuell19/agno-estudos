[CLANGING] [LAUGHTER AND FOOTSTEPS] [LOUD LAUGHTER, CLANGING] Ah, do you want a push, Val? - Joe, you could push faster. - Faster! Faster? [VAL SCREAMS] Oh, I'm getting dizzy! [TITLE MUSIC BEGINS] - Fast enough? - No! [SONG LYRICS] "Who am I?" "Who am I?" "The spirit of those who were not here"... ..."and never knew it" "Who left this prayer to elope" [LAUGHTER AND SCREAMS] "The lovers journey though it."

Oh, don't worry. - But she really is very ill. - No, I'm used to it. It's all in a day's work. Have you got rid of him, Val? [BOTH LAUGH] I'll see you out. Okay. - I wonder if I could have a word? - Oh. Just a quick word. Urn, I just wondered, erm... ...what exactly is wrong with your mother? Well, she's got multiple sclerosis. - She's had if for a long time. - Well, that can't be easy for you. Oh, I've got used to it now. Tell you what, why don't you drop in and see me sometime. Next couple of days. I might be able to arrange a home help. - Do you think you could? - Yes, I don't see why not. Look, erm--- I'm organising a trip to Brighton. Why don't you come, too? - Oh, I don't know. - Bring the baby, do him good. And I could use some adult help. - Well, I'll see. - Fine. Well, think about it and I'll see you next week. - Hello. - He's dishy! - Shush! - You turnin'? - [TUTS] Oh, honestly. - When you gonna go to Sunday school? I was wondering if you'd like to join me for a drink? It's just around the corner here. I'm sorry, I've gotta go straight home. I feel I've got so much to talk to you about. Yeah, but I've really gotta go now. Well, will you have dinner with me one night, then? I don't think I can. - Don't you like me? - Oh, I didn't mean that. Well, why not, then? Well, it's--- it's the baby, I can't leave him at night. Well, do bring him along, just for a while. I mean, every evening, say, er, Monday night? - Well, my mum, she's--- - Well, Tuesday night? It really is a bit difficult. All right, then, Wednesday. Surely that's all right? Say you'll come, Valerie. I'll see. [TELEPHONE RINGS] 7:30, yes, sir. [MOANING] Oooh! Oh, ooh, Arthur. Oh, you know you get better every time, June. [HEAVY SIGHING] Bet you don't get a trunk call like that every day. [JUNE GIGGLES] Here, put your tights on. Don't wanna catch a cold. You've got a bloody nerve. It's been three months. Husband's got his rights, ain't he? Yeah. Don't waste much time, do you? [COUGH] Ah. Did you enjoy that? Yeah, it was very good. Why don't you sit down over here? It's much more comfortable. Oh! I, I feel quite dizzy. I've, er, got the coffee on. In India I read all your best poets. Oh. William Shakespeare, John Betjeman, John Masefield. - A host of others. - Oh. - You're educated, aren't you? - How could you tell? Oh, I think you can always tell. Our teacher at school said you can always tell an educated man. How? Do tell me how. How does it show? I don't know, it's, erm, it's sort of gentle. The man of the Orient is naturally gentle. Yet passionate, too. He is both a tranquil stream, and a raging torrent. That's good. I like that. Hmm. Well, I think I'd better be going now. Oh...? Valerie, um--- We have so much in common, you and I. - We are both in need. - In need? May I tell you, I--- find you beautiful? - Not really. - Don't my eyes speak for me? Aren't they eloquent? Look into my eyes. Go on, look. What do you see? Oh, your pupils, they're, er, they're a bit big. They are dark pools. They reflect your beauty. Ah! [VAL GIGGLES] Please don't laugh. There's something funny? Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. European women don't know how to accept compliments. Oh, I didn't mean to be rude. It's all right. I understand. Oh, I haven't offended you, have l? Oh, go on. You've, er, made it difficult for me. - Oh. - May I... ...hold your hand? I'm so happy we met. I feel I've made a friend at last. - Yeah, well, I think I er--- - May I kiss you? - No! - Please? - No! No! - Please, yes! Why don't you get your bloody hands off me! My friend. [VAL SHRIEKS] My friend! [SHE SCREAMS] Friend?! Well, get off, then. Arrgh! Oh! - Wait--- wait a minute. - GET AWAY! OWW! Oh, my God, Valerie! Look--- Valerie! Valerie, I can explain. I think you've done enough explaining... ...you dirty sod! - Let--- [HE GROANS] Buggeration. [TRAIN HORN] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] - Argh, you sod! - You wanker! Arghh! [BRAYING AND LAUGHING] - Argh! - Get off me! Waaay! Oil! [LAUGHTER] Ah, look, 'e's got 'is bloody scarf! The kids in our area are just being ignored. They're wastage. As for the authorities... ...they just don't give a damn. Do you know how many full-time social workers we have in our area? - No...? - Four. Four full-time social workers. Incredible, isn't it? And they talk about the welfare state. Welfare for whom? It'd be funny if it weren't so tragic. You know, in my parish alone, there are several hundred teenagers. Tough kids, some of them. Kids who think of school as prison and the police as their mortal enemies. Just talk to them about the welfare state, they'd laugh in your face. - Open this bloody door, you sod! - See you in Brighton! Shut the door, quick. Oh, come on you sod. [LAUGHTER] Get out of here. Ah, you sod. You sod! Ah, let go, let go! [LAUGHTER AND SCREAMS] Hey, come on, behave yourselves. Go on, get back in your seat. [MOUTHS "BUGGERS"] What a tosser. Someone's got to get through to them, somehow. Someone who's understanding. [MUSIC BLARING FROM RADIO] Janet, turn that down a bit. No, come on. I'm very keen on pop music, actually. - Are you? - Yes. I think it's the only form of art most people understand nowadays. What d'you mean? Well... it's about them, and their lives. I suppose that's the immediate appeal of it. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] No wankin' in there. Stop wanking, yer dirty bastard. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Shut up! [ZIP NOISE] - Is he all right? Yeah, he's asleep. - Feeding time at the zoo. Buck'? - Sir? Pass these along. [GENERAL CHATTER IN CARRIAGE] ---anagram of u r n. Oh, yes, I see. Could be "Ed." - There we go. - Erm--- "What the bank has to say of your financial affairs"... - ...nine letters beginning with--- - Oi!!! - Listen, you---- Oi! Get yer 'ands off! - It was you outside that door, wasn't it? - Take yer bloody 'ands off, will yer?! Listen, I don't like little yobs screwing me, you understand that? - What's wrong with you? I said I don't like little yobs... ...screwing me, you understand? - Oh, look, get that guard on them--- - Get the guard?! Go on, then! [SHOUTING] - Get out of it! - [GIRL] Smash 'is face in, Barry! - Go and get the bloody guard, then. - Sit down. [YELLING] - Break it up! - Listen... ...are these filthy-minded little buggers with you? - Calm down. - ARE THEY WITH YOU?! - Yes, they are. - Look, would you kindly keep your kids... ...under control? They've got as much right as anybody else--- - Don't tell me about rights! - I'm not telling you anything. I'm asking you to be reasonable. Come on. "Be reasonable"?! I ain't gonna be reasonable with little erks like him! - And this filthy-minded little bugger! - Harry, leave them alone. Don't worry, girl, it's all right. This filthy-minded little bugger ought to be locked up! - Oh? Why? - Well, it's about time they learned a little... - ...consideration for other people. - So let's punish them? Lock them up because they disturb other people's equanimity. Now, don't talk to me about equanimity. I've been a socialist all me life... ...but when I wanna pee, I'll pee in peace! Hear, hear! Fools. You stupid git. - You loud-mouthed 'erbert! - Shh. Shut up. INTERVIEWER - BOB HARRIS: Cause the time we're talking about... ...now, really, is the time when you were basically pretty well unknown. MIKE: Yeah. MIKE: I mean, what, er, I used--- Well, I was into poetry to jazz... - ...before I left school, you know. - Mmm. MIKE: And, er, I sort of--- Well, I was writing... ...poems at night and playing blues stuff in the street. MIKE: You know, Leadbelly and that sort of stuff, you know? MIKE: Now, it wasn't until much later I put the two together, really. MIKE: And, it wasn't until much later that I was, that I was known. BOB: Have your audiences changed during this time? MIKE: Oh, vastly. They're into velvet now - y'know? MIKE: And Rolls Royces. [LAUGHS] BOB: And what were they into before? MIKE: Well, with CND, well, CND was just dying, I s'pose. MIKE: And we were... er, very much like them, you know? MIKE: There was a genuine sort of atmosphere. MIKE: The only difference was that... ...we could sing and--- [SHOUTING] [WHISTLING AND SHOUTING] [SHOUTING AND SCREAMING] Are you enjoying yourself, Scott? Yes, you are! Why did you call him "Scott"? - After the Antarctic? Ha, ha. - No! After Scott Carpenter. After the first spaceman. Trevor was really keen on space. - Who's Trevor? - Oh, that's his father. He used to say that one day we'd all be traveling from planet to planet. Like we use buses today. Do you know, he even built himself a spacesuit? - It's a sort of hobby of his. - Where's Trevor now? - I don't know. - You never hear from him? - No. - I see. Scott - here, look. Ooh! Come and have a look at the fishermen. Ooh, look, he's caught a big fish. What does it feel like when someone does that to you? What? Well, when something that seemed innocent... ...pleasant, perhaps - turns out like that? - Like what? - Well, when you knew for certain... ...that you were pregnant, what did you feel? - I felt very sick. - Sick at the thought of it, you mean? No, just sick. And there it is: a real, live human being. What do you mean? - He's perfectly all right. - I understand how you feel. But don't keep it to yourself. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not ashamed. [BABY STARTS TO CRY] - Ah, come to Mummy, love. - It's a bit hard sometimes when... ...there's no one to turn to, and people just don't seem to care. That's what I'm a priest for, Valerie, that's what the Church is all about. If I thought I couldn't help someone like you I'd chuck this job tomorrow. - Hey, Vic! - What is it? - We're clearin' off. Clearing off? - Yeah, we're pissed off with this. - There ain't nothin' to do 'ere. - We wanna go into the town or somethin'. - Yeah. Well, er, we'll come with you, we'll be along. [BABY CRIES] - Coming? - No, you go - he's tired. Yes, well er, I'd better go and keep an eye on them. - I'll see you at the station. - Mmm. We'll get the five o'clock. [BABY CONTINUES TO CRY] [DRUMS, CYMBALS, SINGING] - Oh, look! Ha ha! - Look at them. - Hey, look! Skinheads! - Ha, ha! What a dopey-looking lot. [SINGING] Hare hare hare rama. Hare Krishna. May I interest you in our magazine? What goin' on, then? What're you sellin'? We're just selling a magazine called Back to Godhead... ...which will tell you more about the Hare Krishna movement. What do you mean "Harry Krishna", you're, you're a Buddhist. No, we're not Buddhists, we're non-sectarian. Well, you're still a Buddhist, though, aren't yer? No, there is a difference from our teaching and the Buddhist teachings. - We're teaching that God is a person. -l see,yeah. - Well, what about Jesus Christ? - Well, this magazine will explain that... - ...Jesus is part of the love of Krishna. - Ah, it's like the Church, then. BOB: Mike, now you're a singer with an increasingly large following. Your ideas are projected through the mass media and therefore... ...get to be heard by an enormous number of people. What is it exactly that you're trying to say? Well, I don't think my ideas carry very far as such. I don't really believe that. I think you'd be overestimating both the audience... ...and me if you thought they did. You know, sometime the audience are much faster than I am to the joke. I mean, neither of us are faster than... ...each other. There's a complete interchange. You know, they feel things, I feel things. And we do it together. It's not a process of--- It's, it's life. So there's a very strong relationship, then? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's better than--- it's a different relationship than it used to be... - ...within music. - Yeah. What practical changes, though, would you like to help to bring about? Well, I'll have to change me underpants sometime this month. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. But apart from that, and the weather... ...I think actually, the way we live with each other... ...could change; can change. Can't change, actually. It can't, no. I'd like to see it change a lot faster than it can. - In what way, though? - Well, we're bogged down by so much. You know, there's so much--- so many restrictions, and... ...customs - you know? - that... ...you see, by the time we've sometimes got to... ...er, you know, there's a million dead before the disaster has really... ...been notified, you know, has really sort of, reached news level. - Hmm. - And there's another four or five million... ...dead before, you know, food can be got through to--- through the red tape. You know, we ought to be able to care more. Mmm. So how, Mike, now do you feel about the role of religion today? Eeeuugh! [LAUGHTER] Well, I don't, actually. I think it's just... ...it's like it presupposes that we're all guilty... ...and very dirty with it. [LAUGHTER] - Dirty with what? - Guilt. There's nothing like... ...a new-born child is a relatively clean thing that gets very quickly dirtied by... ...religion. Can I say that? Will you allow me to say that? - Mmm. - Thank you. You got any more questions? [BOTH LAUGH] Pop singers are generally regarded, aren't they... ...as singing about young love? Now, you sing about love, but in terms of sort of communication between people. That's just how I feel, anyway. Now, do you agree with that? Yeah, I think that, er, love is something that we've managed to rescue. The race, that is. Above and beyond all the disasters we've had, and we're still having. I think love's a great triumph over Christianity. It's a great victory for us. Really, it's something that we've got... ...against all the trash that's--- that we've got as well. What about marriage, now, Mike? Do you feel it's an outdated convention? Yeah, well, I suppose, you know, I've got to... ...I suppose I've probably had about ten wives. And if they've all had, er, ten males. That's a hundred of us joined. - What, you mean ten ladies? - Into the sky. - Ladies? - Yeah, as opposed to--- There's one on the corner. You don't mean that one...? [BOB LAUGHS] But you haven't been married ten times, have you? [MIKE LAUGHS] It's just... ...you've had a relationship with ladies. Oh, yes, yeah. lt just carries on, eternally, doesn't it? - Mmm. - I mean, I think that's the way it's gotta be. Mmm. Can I bring some other people in now Mike? 'Cause--- - Well, there's--- they're in already. - Yeah but I--- - What about God? - What about God? [GULL SHRIEKS] I think, er--- There you go. Huh. I think actually that we've all been... ...believing in that sort of rubbish for too long. And that we've really gotta believe in ourselves for a change. And... ...try and, you know, see things as they really are. So, you--- Instead of trying to whitewash the whole thing... - ...and, you know--- - So you are your own god, then? - Yeah. We're our own worst god. - How you can stand this? Very well - when you face it. [MIKE CONTINUES] You don't need a leaning post. Come on! [YOUTHS SHOUTING] Come on, keep the ball moving. [SHOUTS] Come on! GOAL [CHEERING] [CRUNCHING FOOTSTEPS] [BABY STARTS TO CRY] Hi. How are you? - I'm all right. - Enjoying it? Yeah, I am. I like what you said. Well, some of it, anyway. - You were up there, then? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, they ask you these kind of questions, if you're... ...if you're that public, you know? - You're famous, then? - No, no. Infamous. [SHE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH] You know, I really did like what you said. Except the bit about marriage. - Oh, what did I say? - About people getting married lots of times. Oh, that. Yeah. Very controversial, yeah. - You don't agree then? - No. 'Cause I think if you love someone - I mean, really love them... ...then once is enough, you don't want anybody else. - You might be right. - I'm sure I am. - Hope? - Huh. Huh. Yeah. You're in love, then? - No. - What about his old man? Yeah, well, that's what I said that about marriage for, you know? I think those who can't make it ought to be able to... ...share each other. You know? How can you share each other? How can you love lots of people? - Well, I do, in a way. - Huh, I wish I could. But I don't think you're right. I don't, don't think people are that lovable, really. Well, it seems to work for me. Oi! Hey, Mike. Come on up, they're ready for you now. - Yeah. Peace. - What peace? Yeah! [SHE LAUGHS QUIETLY] I gotta give one of these spontaneous performances now. - Do you wanna come up and see it? - Can I? - Yeah, sure. - I'd like that. - Yeah, let's go. - All right. - Hey, come on, Scott. - The tide's coming in. [SONG] "I once held the lantern of love" "In my hands. She was all I could see" "Kicking the brown leaves, of childhood around us" "We danced the deep sea" "That welled from the spring of the boy that I was" "Held in her flame." "Feeling her learning, Watching her burning" "To see the first man I became." "Little lady" "Who made me" "Was it you or my own unforgiveness" "That I can't forget?" "I was her war child, and she was my wildcat" "We lived in a dream" "Broke up the summer unfolding a secret" "And woke up downstream" "Facing the current, that said that we couldn't go home." "Cutting the seed up with sharp tongues and no doubt" "Before it was born." "Little lady" "Who made me" "Was it you or my own unforgiveness" "That I can't forget?" "That I can't forget?" Cut it. There's a boob in the last verse somewhere. Never mind, we'll do another one tomorrow. Yeah. MIKE: We normally go round that way. Sorry. Down here'll do. - Yeah. - Do you like it? Yeah, it's all right. - No more football! - No more football? No, certainly not. Huh! Cheeky. [GROUP CHATTER] Come on! [WHOOP] Do you like that? Ha, ha! You like that, don't you? Yes, you do, you're splashing Mummy. Come on. Get you out now. Ooh, you're getting so heavy. Huh. There. Give mummy a smile. Come on. Give mummy a smile. Yes. There. Ooh, now a big kiss. Yes. He liked it in that big bath. Didn't you, Scott? - Dirty little mongrel. - Ha. You're always on the move. You must get sick and tired of it, wandering from place to place. I'm well used to it now. It's the same old cell everywhere. You know. It's not bad, this one... - ...just bloody terrible. - Ha. How long do you think you're gonna stay here? 'Til the Drug Squad arrive. [BOTH LAUGH] - No, well, tomorrow, I s'pose. - Here are the strings you wanted, Mike. - Thanks, man. - Anything else you need? - No, nothing. - Anything for the baby? - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. - Are you sure? - Yeah, positive. Still got a hell of a lot to do. - See you in the morning. All right? - Yeah, bye bye. Thanks for letting me use your room. It's very nice of you. It's nice to talk to you. But a lot of guys would. Hmm. Not just to talk to, though. Can you blame them? Male instinct. Mmm. It's a bit of a pity, though. How happy are you? [BABY CHATTERS] I don't know. What about the little old man there, I mean you... ...you're making a bit of the future there, aren't you? - Oh, he's all right. - Huh. He might be, you know. But I think... ...a lot of his happiness depends on yours. [BABY CRIES] I mean, you said that... ...you weren't in love. Have you ever been in love? No. Have you? I thought I was three times, yeah, but... ...two of those were broken up by parents and the other split of her own... ...free will, so I s'pose I'll never really know. - Do you ever think about them? - Sometimes. Not often though, you know, I think I've been so... ...frustrated by the way the world is, I just... ...tend to to make love to the guitar now. Ha. - You're not doing so badly. - Yeah. That's an ageless picture. Click. But do you know what I mean? About it not being easy to find someone? Yeah. Sometimes I've thought straight away, you know, this is the one. And been wrong. And sometimes someone's grown on me over a long period of time. - Maybe eventually someone'll stay. - Do you think so? It's possible. But I never, I never close the door on any of me relationships, you know... ...so that I'll probably always have one going. You know, more than one going at once. I mean, it's not really that easy for a girl. - I wish I could change my life a bit. - Well, you can. You must, I think, if you don't like the way it is. You know? [BABY CRIES] I think if you go around with a... - [BOTH] ...long face--- - It's gonna stay that way. - Anyway, I think you're very attractive. - Anyway what? [BABY CRYING LOUDLY] Have you got a clean nappy? It's getting a bit high in here. He's crafty, he just wants to get in bed with us, that's what it is. Yeah. There, that's better. - There we are. - Hello, mate. [MIKE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH] [BABY CRIES] Sshhh. Do you think a girl should go to bed with a feller if he doesn't love her? - No. Unless it's me. - Oh! [BOTH GIGGLE] - I'll be like that when I'm fifty. - Might be before. [LAUGHS] Yeah, it probably will the rate I'm going on. How d'ya do? I'm afraid you'll have to have him on that side. He likes it in the middle. He like the hairs on your chest. Oh, does he? Don't you? No comment. [VAL GIGGLES] VAL: Mmm. [THEY KISS] MIKE: Do you want some kip? MIKE: Can I whisper you something? [HE WHISPERS] No pissing on me, mate. [VAL LAUGHS] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Mike? Mike? Mike, are you awake? Come on, it's half six. [BABY CRIES] Ah, isn't that a lovely picture? Fuck off. Now, come on, we're due on location at seven. " Get Up! - Urgh! Orders. He's heading for an all-in freakout. [BOTH LAUGH] I'm just not free these days. Just not free. I don't know. I don't know. [TENDER MUSIC] You can see the horizon this morning - look. Yeah, it's lovely isn't it? Yeah. - It was nice to--- - It was, wasn't it? Yeah. I'll write. [TENDER MUSIC] [SOUND OF TRAIN GETS LOUDER] Ooowwha! Oh, I can't stop! [LAUGHING] - Hello. - Hello. - You're looking very happy. - Oh, am I? Yes. How exactly did this happen, Mrs Marshall? Oh, well, I, er... I fell, er, in the kitchen - I fell down. - Fell hard, did you? - Well, I sort of twisted myself. You are looking happy. I can look happy, can't I? I'm just happy, that's all. But you don't want to talk to me about it? Not particularly. She'll have to go to hospital for a few weeks. - Can I go with her? - Certainly you can. - Is it a secret? - No. It's not a secret but you won't tell me? - Why not? - It's personal. I was wondering if it was anything to do with that chap you met at Brighton? All right, all right, it's him. - I thought as much. - Any objections? Certainly not! God forbid I should resent anybody. Valerie, you understand why I'm interested? It's because I care about you. I've told you everything, haven%I? Yes, but why do you resent telling me? Cause you're just like my bloody mum sometimes. [CROWD CHATTER, SOUND OF RATTLES] [FUNKY MUSIC] Want a ?it, damn"? Ha, ha'.! [WOLF WHISTLE] - Oh, there you are! At last. - I came up as soon as I got the message. - Thought you were never coming. - They said you were bad. You look all right. Well, I wouldn't be in here if I was all right, would I? Oh, Mum, I thought you'd got worse. Well, at least you're here. You know I would have come up tonight as usual. Huh. Well, I was feeling so depressed, Val, I had to make sure you'd come. You know what I mean. It's this place, it's getting me down. Been lying here thinking. Do you remember Mrs True, when she was in hospital? Her daughter never left her side. But I come up every night, don't I? Now I can tell you, Valerie... ...there'll come a time when you'll be sorry I'm not here. When you'll wish you could hear my voice. Only I won't be here then. There'll just be silence. You'll be sorry for some of the things you've said when I'm gone. I know when my mum died... ...there was this... awful silence. Nurse! Nurse! You'll be all right, darling. [CROWD ROARS] [CHEERING] City! [CLAP-CLAP-CLAP] City! [CLAP-CLAP-CLAP] - Oh! Hello, Ray. - Hello, June. - Bit late, aren't yer? - What for? - The match, it's almost over. - Nah, I gotta work love, 'aven't I? - Lucky feller. - What's all this caper, then? - Oh. - It's not yours, is it? - How is Val these days? - Fine. - Her mum's in hospital, though. - Oh, that's tough, I didn't know that.

I've some--- about the little kiddie, I'm afraid. What about? [SHE GASPS] What about him? I understand that a lady friend of yours took him for a walk in the pram. They went along by the football ground... ...just as the... [VAL: SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH] ...crowds were coming out, and... [VAL WHIMPERS] ...a fight started and, er... [VAL FIGHTS FOR BREATH] ...the pram was pushed down some steps. No. And the little baby was killed. No! No! [VAL SCREAMS] NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! NO! [PLEADING] I want my baby. What is it, Val'? - What is it? - Oh, Mum. It's Scott. He, he's--- [HER VOICE CONSTRICTED BY SOBS] Dead. Dead. No. No, he--- No. He can't be. Yes. Yes. [SOBBING] No, he can't--- I mean--- He's gone. - No, love, no, love, no. Oh, no. - Oh--- Oh--- Oh, Mum. [VAL SOBS HYSTERICALLY] - All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, love. All right. It's all right, love, all right. All right, my baby, now, that's it, that's it. That's it, that's all right, you cry. [VAL HOWLS] No, no, no, no, no, no. - Come on, come on. - Oh, Mum! That's all right, baby. - You--- There, there, sssh. - What am I gonna do? All right, all right. [SOBBING] [ORGAN INTRODUCTION: "JERUSALEM"] [SEGUES INTO FOLK-ROCK VERSION] [DOOR SHUTS] - Roast beef or cottage pie, dear? - Er, cottage pie, please. - You all right? - Yeah. I'll see you upstairs. Excuse me? Excuse me, I hope I'm not disturbing you. May I sit down? I was hoping to speak with you. I have something for you. Urn... ...you see, I heard about your most unfortunate event from the papers. "When a mother loses her child"... - ..."there is heaviness in her heart." - Well, I said if you want to get a new... ...driver, you go ahead. - Ah-ha. Get a new driver. Nothing to do with me. I'm not gonna lose any sleep. - "Her heart is like stone." - "It's your soddin' loss", I said. Not mine. After all, I'm not gonna lose a wink 0' sleep over it. "Her heart is like stone." I feel it deeply. I was moved, when I read of your tragedy. Nothing can bring him back. But I have done a little something which may be of comfort to you. You may care to look at it now and again. It's a poem. An elegy, to be precise. "Elegy for Scott Marshall". [CLEARS THROAT] "Little Scott, the tiny tot." "Hardly a summer's swallow flew o'er his sleepy head." "He scarcely knew a tulip from a daisy." "But now, he walks the chambers of the dead." "The fools who slew him must have been half crazy." Hey, Val. Mike. Hi, how are you? I've been working up the road. - Oh, Mike! [VAL STARTS SOBBING] - What's the matter? - Oh, Mike. - What's happened? Come on, we'd better go inside. Sometimes I think I would've done myself in if it wasn't for you. All I ever wanted was to be happy. To be in love. Not asking much, is it? And now I've met you. - But nothing goes right. - Oh, come on. It's just not fair, is it? It'll change. It'll change. I've been down a few times. [VAL SIGHS] Friend of mine woke up on the waterfront one day... ...in a hotel. Near San Francisco. And he ordered twenty-four pounds of steak for breakfast. They threw half of it in the water... ...got a fishing rod out, and they were pulling sharks in all day. - Don't believe you. - True, they filled the bath. Yeah. They're having a go at each other in the bath... All morning. - Who was? - The sharks. On! [BOTH LAUGH] And then, then they fill the wardrobe. - What, the sharks did? - Yeah. And then they got thrown out. [LAUGHING] Everyone. [BOTH LAUGH] Even the law-abiding citizens. [VAL LAUGHS] Yeah. Anyway. [SHOUTS AND LAUGHTER] Hey, there's a note here for you. It's from June. Mum's feeling worse again, she wants me to go to the 'ospital. - Bad, is she? - No more than usual, I expect. It's that place, it's getting her down. Well, you go and see her. I'll be all right here. - Have you got a towel? - Yeah. Can you turn the fire on? - Yeah. Oh, Christ! [LAUGHTER] [BOTH START LAUGHING] Can you help me here? - Bloody thing. - What's up, has it shrunk? Fuckin' 'ell! [BOTH LAUGH] Kneel down, kneel down on the floor. [BOTH LAUGH] I think your 'ead's got bigger! - Don't laugh! Agh! - I'm sorry, I am pulling. [LAUGHTER] Hey, wait a minute, fuckin' 'ell! Here, let's get it off. [LAUGHTER] Ha! You should see yourself. [LAUGHTER] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hello. I'm here to see Mrs Marshall. - Oh, yes. Are you Father Dyson? Yes, I am. - I'll take you along to the ward. - Thank you. Did you manage to contact the daughter? No, I'm afraid not, but I left a message with her friend. Oh, good. [LABOURED BREATHING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Yeah? - Do you want this? - Yeah, come in. - Not shy, are yer? - No! Well, come in, then. [SPLASHING WATER] - You got any shampoo? - Yeah. - Here. Arghh! [SHRIEKING] No! No! Argh! [LAUGHS] [SHRIEKING] Stop it! [LAUGHS] ' Ha! " Ch! You rotten thing! [SCREAMS AND LAUGHS] Come here, give us that towel! Agh! [LAUGHING] No! Oh, I'm drowned. [EXHAUSTED LAUGH] [HALTING, IRREGULAR BREATHS] [SILENCE] Hey, look at this. Oh! [VAL LAUGHS] The Kaiser as Butch Cassidy. You look like the dog's dinner. I am. [VAL LAUGHS] I feel like it, anyway. Would you like a cup of tea? Later. Mmm. [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN] Oh. We've been trying to contact you all day. Yeah, well, I've been out. [DOOR SLAMS INSIDE FLAT] - Hello, man. - Hello. Valerie. It's your mother, I'm afraid. She died about twenty minutes ago. - What? - Yes. I'm sorry. - She's been like that for ages. - Not like this. - I can't believe it. - I phoned June. - Didn't you get the message? - Yeah, but, I didn't realise that--- I'm sorry. You must feel terrible. [VAL SIGHS] Urm, just a minute. I wonder if I could have a word. It won't take long. Look, I know it's none of my business but I just want to ask you... ...what your plans are with regard to Valerie. Can you stay with her for the next few weeks? That's impossible, I've got concerts. - Where? - All over the place. America. The world. I see. You know, Val needs help. Right. I've been trying to help her. How? Well I've given her a bit of happiness haven't I? Are you doing anything? At least I have a sense of responsibility towards her. Responsibility? I've heard that before. That's the word you lot use to get people... ...wrapped up and tied in knots. That's just the sort of attitude I'd expect from you. Oh, look. Have you ever laid out under the sky all night... ...and thought about how big you really are? - Yes. - How can you talk about... ...responsibility underneath that? - I see. - Let it do its own work. We have no control over it. All we can really do is live it as it comes. Naturally. You know, just live, and love... - ...and be kind. - What you really mean... ...is come and go and never mind the consequences. That's the sort of idle, selfish attitude that's caused more unhappiness... and poverty than anything el--- - And where would the Church be... ...without unhappiness and poverty? You need unhappiness and poverty to survive. You've been running society like that for the last two thousand years. And whose is the bigger congregation now? - Is it yours or ours? - Perhaps bigger, but is it any better? Drugs and promiscuity, is that better? [MIKE] We'd be a lot better off without your warped ideas... ...about responsibility and guilt. - Look what you've done to her. - I have?! If you think I'm gonna let you get away with that... - ...you're very much mistaken. - Oh, piss off, Your Holiness! That doesn't cut any ice with me. I've met your type before. I only wish I could stay, you know. But I can't. They'll be missing me already. - Yeah. - I'm late, for the session. And after that it's the airport. You'll be back again? [TENDER, WISTFUL MUSIC] - Not soon, but--- - Yeah, sure. I don't know when... ...you know, but I'll see you later. I'll come the airport with you. No, that's not a good idea. You know how plastic that is. Chaos. We'd never get a chance to speak even. Yeah. I'll think of you. That's a promise. Remember what I've been trying to tell you though, you know. Try not to be too idealistic about the "eternal love" bit, you know. I think you are. It's not working out that way too well, nowadays. You know, hang loose a bit and try to take people on their own terms. We've all got to make it together these days. There's too much isolation going on. There's too many people cut off. You know, don't cling to obsolete ideals. It's not gonna work, love.

Oh, yes, thank you. It's not the same when I'm wearing my dog collar. I like it here, do you? Yeah, it's nice. I used to come here a lot. Are you winning? Never mind, just cut it. Hey, look at that dog! Ha, ha. Val, you know, I'm certain things are going to go well for you again. After all, you're a very attractive girl. I don't see why you shouldn't meet someone. Someone like you. With your own ideas. I'm sure you'll meet someone and fall in love. I've already met someone. Oh. Yes, I know. I'm sure he was fun to be with... ...but he wasn't fundamentally your kind of man. He lives a different kind of life. His values can't apply to you. I don't think you should make him the centre of things. I don't see why I can't. You live in different worlds. He's always on the move. I expect he--- He must have met a lot of girls like you. He didn't say I was anything special. He didn't say he loved me. He was sincere. He said it didn't matter what you do as long as you were happy. - And I was happy. - Yes, that's all very well... ...but it doesn't always have happy results, does it? You say you wanna help, but you seem to make things worse. I don't understand you, there must be something wrong with you. Why don't you just go away and leave me alone! - Val, I'm sorry. - Leave me alone! Bloody well go away and leave me alone! You see, I am not your idea of a conventional Christian. I am not a shoulder for you to cry on. I am not here to help you on your way. I am not "Mr Sympathetic". There's no turning the other cheek with me. That is not the kind of Christian I am. Don't come to me for incense and Evensong... ...you won't find me kneeling at the altar all day long. If people won't come to me here, in the church, with their problems... ...then I must go out to them. And that is what we all have got to do. We have to do it together. We have to deal with the problems... ...that concern everybody. We cannot confine ourselves to the Church. We have got to go out and bring about... ...a greater understanding between people. Between generations. We have got to re-establish our community. And fight against this self- obsessed, self-satisfied society. [KNOCKING] - Valerie. - Hello. [DOOR SHUTS] Sweet? Thanks. So nice to see you. Nice to see you. Er, I was feeling lonely, I felt like some company. So easy to be lonely. It's a problem in society. Mass media seems to be the only communication. I think you should love who you can. Make the most of it and hope it works. Oh, yes! You don't have to be afraid 'cause I'm white or anything. Oh, believe me, that doesn't deter me in the slightest. - I merely thought--- - Look, let the past be the the past. Let's forget it, shall we? [URGENT BREATHING] [GROANING] [PANTING AND MOANING] Ah...! [URGENT BREATHING AND CRIES] That was beautiful. The most beautiful moment of my life. [SIGHING AND SHALLOW BREATHING] I feel divine! I could fly! Yeah, well, I'll see you around, I expect. - You're not going! - Yeah, 'course I am. But you can't. I won't let you. - Why not? - We're in love, that's why not! - What? - In love! [VAL LAUGHS] Valerie. Come back one moment, my darling sweetheart. I want you for me wi--- Excuse me. Wait a moment. Valerie. [CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER] - Valerie, look, please, come back inside. - Get off! Valerie, look, please, what have I done? - What do you want? - Well, come back inside! - We'll talk about it. - I don't wanna come back inside. I've got nothing to talk about. Yeah, and you're showing me up. - Would you let me go home? - Valerie, please, come in. Valerie, please. You're hurting me, get off! Stop that! What's up with you?! [SIGH] I don't wanna go inside. - Valerie. - Please let me go home. - I don't care about--- - You'll be cold out here. - I wanna go home. - Valerie, please! - Oh, get off. - Come on, hands off. - Constable, look--- - Shut up. - Did he interfere with you? - No, I did not! - Did he expose himself? - How dare you! - When I want your opinion I'll ask for it. - No, look, he's a friend of mine. Huh, huh, "friend", she calls me "friend"! - Okay, then, buzz off, you. - I demand my rights. - Go home son, go home. - But you don't understand, she's my wife. - You what? - My wife. - Is he your husband. - No! - Valerie! - Oh, shut up, you stupid black bastard! Got somewhere to go? Home, I s'pose. [POLICE RADIO] We'll take you. Okay, Charlie. - Oh, look at me. - Oh, you look all right. I'm a mess. Life's not always good, is it? Oh. If it wasn't for blokes there'd be nothing else. You've got to have relationships. Mmm. That's what your Mike was always on about, wasn't he? - Have you heard from him? - No. Don't expect I will, though. - He's always on the move. - Oh, I wouldn't like that. - Why not? - Oh, it's 'orrible. Well, we had a good time together. We enjoyed it. I think about him. I hope he thinks about me sometimes. I've gotta get off at the next stop. Oh, I thought you were coming back with me? No, love, I can't, I've got a headache. Oh, you should've said. Look, I'll come with you. No, really, I'm all right, honest. - I'll see you later. - You sure? Okay. ' BYE bye. - Bye.
