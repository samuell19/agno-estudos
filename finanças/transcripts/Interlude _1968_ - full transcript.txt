INTERLUDE Now that it's been a long time... so many years... since our only meeting... I want to remind you that day of spring. I want you to relive those 6 hours we lived together. I was always thinking that coincidences are the most important in our lives. That's why our acquaintance left me with something I've never lived before. Of course you know as ? also do that our story didn't become a big love. It didn't become a story like those in books. Nothing thrilling happened in those 6 hours of train's delay. I don't know about you. I don't even know where you are now. I don't even know if you remember that I existed. I have thought many times in my every-day life of what this interlude might have meant to you. I never made it to find an answer... Now that it's been a long time, so many years since our only meeting... I'm coming to remind you that day of spring... We were both returning from a trip. You had gone to a provincial town to deliver some architectural drawings. I was coming back from some distant relatives The train would reach your town soon. I would continue my trip returning to my husband, to another town. We talked. You didn't ask my name neither did I. That's how we met. And we had a light conversation with words like those in every beginning, words that travellers say in trains... Everyone can say those words, when nothing goes on after. And then, they forget them. Now I'm thinking of what can happen in a moment. Sometimes, this moment can bring you to the end of the world. I watched you pause for a while... and you were looking at me. I felt my heart strangely stop. Like then, in my childhood... when a blond boy was waiting for me in the corner. The train was reaching your town. You asked me if you could send me a card. Then right at that moment before I answer in time... It was announced that instead of the normal 10-minute stop, the train would remain in your town for 6 hours. You smiled. 'You can't leave,' you said. Then you suggested we pass together those hours. I knew I didn't have the right to dream... but I took the decision. You were born here. Everyone's childhood was similar. At first, the world is your house. Then, the road you see from the window. Then, the neighbourhood. Something is growing inside you as you go on from one road to the other. The town looks increasingly big to you. But instead of knowing it, you lose it. And when you start to say that you get to know it, you understand it how little it give away to you its secrets. How little you got to know her. Then, you told me that you decided once to learn all of its secrets, its history, so you can say you know everything. You read its history from the books but only a strange colour remained. Chronologies that are not fixed. Buccaneer ships that anchor. An unreal sea battle. All that world that passed tells you again that you tried in vain to learn about it. Only that colour remains. As if you had caressed a cheek and your fingers had stopped on a wrinkle. I understood how much you love this town. You talked so much about it. I didn't ask you why. Every man has a past belonging to him. Let's say, it's been a long time since we met and, let's assume, the hours we passed together were years. In dreams, everything can happen in the same moment. I know that I won't be dreaming of you when I'll be gone... neither you will. So, we're going to live these few hours knowing that they will never come again. We have a deadline. Six hours. We are together. The great, eternal loves that become statues and books, are not like our story. Its passage through the world is trivial. Its story was written for us two, in 6 hours. Every love hiddes its own secret which is unlike any other. If someone saw you, If someone saw me, would he recognise us? Why I was laughing? Why I was happy? Think that neither you nor I had said our names yet. You said that tomorrow we won't both be able to tell anything about all these either to ourselves or to others. A secret will be born from these 6 hours, we are going to cherish. It was a nice day indeed. And when I asked you where we're going, you said 'To the end of the world...' Then, I wanted to tell you a word to take it with you. To have it with you, tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow, too. A word to keep you company at the dawns. Why do you always turn and look into my eyes? We can delude ourselves whenever we want. Yet, might this delusion be the truth? Something you said to me aloud... Something you said to me... You recalled the summer moon and a song of the road in the sunrise. That's how you gave me a slice of your life. You didn't say anything more. You designed our home on the sand. The fence, the entrance gate, the balcony, the road, the rose garden, the sea-view windows You favoured armchairs of faint crimson colour, which makes them look old. You didn't want hidden lighting. The lamps would be laid low on the tables... and big vases would stand in the corners. I'd cut the flowers from the garden by myself. Though we knew this house would never be made for us, we had already enjoyed it. We had seen the moon set... the fireplace smoking in the corner... the garden getting green, and turning pale in the winter wind. From that moment on I kept the dream untouched into my heart. We hesitated at the edge of the forest We already wanted for a long time to look at the watch. The shadow of the quick breakup had fallen on us. Time was going by... The light was getting weaker. You were looking at me. You had understood everything I couldn't tell you... everything I didn't have the time to tell you. Then, I thought that a man cannot ever draw near to the loneliness of a woman. What can a photograph preserve? Only that moment. It was my idea to take photographs together. In a moment I would go away. That was a way to have something yours. Something mine. An unrepeatable moment in the time. We agreed not to show them anywhere To be only for us. On winter evenings I would pick them out of the drawer and gaze at them and the memory of that spring day would flutter inside me. Nothing gets forgotten or changes with the photographs. I wanted to have always with me a little of the 6 hours... to remember you at the moments of loneliness.. When I will be nowhere for you, you will still be close to me. You mustn't feel sad. Don't look at me. In a few moments we will part. Don't be sad. I can see you stand alone here at another day a long time from today I won't be anywhere for you, then. I always wanted to fly above the clouds. They didn't let me. No one allowed me ever. Everyone called happiness this continuity, the everyday life. And now, you... in these 6 hours... you gave me the change. The flight. Thank you. Your home was in this street. You asked me to come up if I wanted. I looked at you... like, then, in my first love for which I didn't want to tell you anything about... Then, you went on and walked up the stairs. No, maybe it was a mistake we got as far as here. Maybe it was a mistake even that we met. But I wasn't neither stronger nor weaker than you. I was like you. I knew that nothing will remain from this meeting but a shadow. No, I wouldn't come up. I knew that tomorrow we wouldn't be together since we would lose one another forever. But if something was moving inside me, this wasn't for that moment, but for tomorrow when you wouldn't be close to me. No, it shouldn't end like this. You understood that... without telling me. When we left your house, I remembered another one, mine. Another time. Another spring. It was a date with someone I loved. I was late and I run to meet him at the large dock. I waited for him. He hadn't showed up yet. The time was going by. And then, I thought that I saw him, and I ran to him. I was waving to him from a distance. When I reached him, I realized it wasn't him, but someone else. My chest felt heavy. The stranger went away, and I stayed there. A light rain began to fall. Then I ran to another place in the forest to find him. But he wasn't there either. Then, you told me about a night a night you spent browsing through books and wandering in the streets of your town. It was a night of loneliness and, the same time, a night of sheer happiness It was a night of looking for the knowledge of others in the books. and of looking for what happiness meant to other people. And the only thing you understood was that real happiness can be found outside ourselves, too, far away and very close to us. Here, at the edge of the sea, the interlude of the 6 hours was ending. If I look into myself, I will hear the same heartbeat of my time of youth. Why do we need to seek confirmation? We've reached something both of us could not imagine before. So, was it a game that wasn't game? What can be measured by time? Who can say this 'something,' given to us by chance, wasn't something great? Now that the dream passed right through us, it became reality. Don't run to catch up with it. Don't say farewell to it. Yes. For me, this interlude was the most important in my life. The time went by. 6 hours went by. The interlude closed. We were over. I said goodbye to you, near to the sea. We agreed you won't walk me to the station. It would be easier that way. I knew I won't see you again. I would return to my home and you would stay in your town. Then you said you wanted to give me something to remember you. You searched... but you didn't find anything. And then, you said one word. One single word. Goodbye. I didn't admit that we are over. No. I didn't admit that. As the train was leaving, I didn't see you. That's what we agreed. I only, little by little, started dreaming of coming back to your town and living our interlude again but now in winter. It's a long time since that day. How is the street? The sea? The forest? The sky? It's like a sudden pain that burns the eyes. No, I didn't find you again. But the interlude that brought us together returned. You are with me again. We speak together again. We went together near to your childhood dreams. I had already thought of asking you this, back then. To write each other a letter, before we part. I had paper and envelopes in my bag. I gave some to you and I myself took some too. 'We're going to write a letter,' I told you, as if the years had passed. Then we exchanged them. What did you write? 'My dear, You will set to go tonight. You will go away. Our breakup will come and there's nothing to go on. You can imagine that you won't exist for me any more... and that for you I won't exist too. I won't know the town where you will go. I won't come. I won't come there looking for you. I won't be able to remember you.' You ask me if I remember your house. No. It wasn't that. The door doesn't look alike. We walked together till I find it. It's so nice to be with you. Everything seems great and important to me. How could a story that lasted a few hours, fill up a whole life? And yet... it left a deep mark on me. A night, years before, I heard them talking about a woman. She had a romance. A love affair. Someone asked her something. A silence followed. A cold silence. He refused to believe it. A love affair? A romance? What about me? He said. And then? No, he didn't learn the details. In these stories, there are no details. A short while ago, it was different. We could speak about breakup. About memories. Now, the distance is getting larger. And right before the end, the separation came first. I want to remember something... something. We were left alone in the snowy forest. And we decided to find something. Something to replace us. That way, separating would be easier. We walked into the snow. Both of us separately though of that. And then... we returned to the same place. For me nothing could take your place. You said the same. Tell me that distances can disappear... that the moment we lived will be back. Now that I'm looking for you, I want to drive away the shadow cast by the coming end. But whatever I do, the dream itself keeps distance. Do you remember what you told me? We can see each other even when we won't be together. When we separately remember each other the story we changed will be already dead. That's what you told me. Did I look sad to you? I wasn't. Happiness flood my heart. You understood that. You speak to me again about favourite places... long trips... bygone joys. You speak to me again about you and me. In the winter cold you speak to me about summer moons... about songs you hear coming from the sea... and you ask me if I can also see these all... if I can hear them as well. I see you on the horizon as if you were shrouded in fog.... watching with the same eyes other days, other joys... You speak to me like you did then. As if you had found me again, too, as if you had been looking for me. I feel that the winter dream comes to an end. These are the last moments and our last noon. But let's assume that this is our start, and let's make the big table. as if we were waiting for guests... as if it was a feast. Don't be sad because I'm going away. Don't be sad because we're left alone. If you hadn't come... If I hadn't met you... everything would have been different. I would have been back in another life... where I belong to. You stopped talking anymore. We are becoming the dream of all those who are watching us. Maybe they laugh because they don't believe. They don't believe that we exist, because they can't imagine it. Maybe, all these things are true... I feel that I'm losing you. You didn't hurt me. You didn't fooled me. You didn't forget me. The moments are playing their last game. The interlude ended. So, was it a lie? Do you believe it? Say that we will continue. That the interlude of the 6 hours will be all our life. And let's separate. What is it? I can't hear you anymore. The time goes by. I'm losing you. Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
