This is kabc radio. I'm geri Nichols. Latest crime statistics, released today, show an alarming rise in violence. In the last five years, homicides in Los Angeles county are up 79%. Robberies are up 68%. Aggravated assault, another violent crime, shows an increase of 599,, rapes have increased 61% and lesser crimes are up, too. Today I spoke to Los Angeles police commissioner, Herman Baldwin. The fear of crime has brought a deterioration of our community. It's almost as if we've been struck by enemy bombs. The number of citizens killed and maimed by criminal violence has produced in me a great and personal resolve. The only way we're going to win, and make no mistake, this is a war. The only way we'll win is by assuming the offensive. Positive policing is the answer. We've got to deploy all our resources or criminal violence will destroy our community. But what are the resources needed to diminish the alarming rise in crimes. There are those who say heavier prison sentences and an increased police facility are enough. Yeah, I'm one of them. There are others who believe that prison never cured anyone. And, judging by the rise in violence, it never deterred anyone either. Here comes the commercial. Dr. Irving Clark... I know it's your radio station, and I sure like miss Nichols, but I can't take this. It's not my radio station, I'm only the architect for the new one. Miss Nichols is late. She's still on the radio. They recorded that earlier. Hey, there she is now. Don't be late for dinner. Your daughter sure ate well last time. - That's 'cause you're a great cook. - For her, nothing is too much. We won't be late. We were supposed to be there at 10:30. We'll make it. The senator's aide would not get off the phone. Oh, and Los Angeles magazine's gone for my idea of a series of articles on criminal rehabilitation. That's great. Hello, baby. You look really good. Hi, Carol, we're not late, are we? Has there been any progress this week, doctor? Nurse tells me she asked for dinner on Thursday night. That's the fifth week running she's said a few words. That's not much after two years. Will she ever come back to me? Will she ever be normal again? You're her father, Mr. kersey. You can only give her your love. And your prayers, too. I remember you liked kites when you were a kid. Do you still like 'em? We haven't bought you your ice cream yet. You mean we haven't bought your ice cream yet. A man has to have some vices. But I'll tell you what. You choose whatever vou want from this table. And I'll go off and buy the ice cream. Look at him. So, what he look like? Let's do it. - Out the way, motherfucker. - Get out the way! Watch out, asshole! Go get your ice cream, man. Asshole. Hey! They got his wallet! It's nice. - Where's my wallet? - I ain't got it. Guess what? I got up to the front of the line and discovered I'd forgotten my wallet. This time you two come with me. But I'm gonna have to borrow some money. I think we can manage that. Carol, where have you been? I haven't seen you for a couple of weeks. I thought you'd deserted me. What happened, Paul? Nothing. Well you didn't forget your wallet. You never forget anything. I'll tell you about it later. I could stay. I could do the interview another time. The senator's only here for a day. If I were you, I wouldn't miss the opportunity. - I'll see you at dinner, okay? - Okay. Hey, Paul. You coming aboard? This is the place. Super fine. - Easy, my man. - We got business. Mike, I thought you weren't coming. You know I wouldn't. Have you told Jenny? =t will. Who is it? I've got a delivery for Mr. kersey. Who from? Who is this delivery from? I can't rub out ten years of a marriage. Like it never happened. I've got to think of the children. Come on! =no! Just her, no one else here. We wanted to give Mr. Kersey his wallet back. Personally. Hey, man, look at that. Isn't that pretty? No! No! No! Lady, you disturb the neighbors and I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and eat you for dinner. Hey jiver, save some for me, man! Ah, oh, oh, yeah. Getting it good jiver, getting it good. My turn now, man. Take her in the bedroom. Jiver, check out the window for the man. Woo, woo, woo! - We can't hang in here forever. - Hey, I want him. Just be cool, man. He'll come. Nirvana, you want a bit? Is there any left? =yes. You wait in here, watch for the man. All right now, lady. Quietly. Do it nice. Are you hungry. Let's see what rosaria has for dinner. Rosaria. Rosarial we're home! Man, you... - Smack the whore. - Get her, man! Let's get the fuck outta here! Use the back! Take her, she's seen us, she can finger us all. Come on, keep moving. Get in there, girl! There is only one truth about the use of the death penalty. To show that killing is wrong. Thank you, senator. That was senator Robert mclean. And this has been newsdesk, brought to you by kabc Los Angeles. I'm geri Nichols. Nirvana, how long we gonna stay here? Ah, it's nice here. Yeah, and we got a nice little lady. What are we gonna do. Waste her? She's seen us, she can finger us all. The man saw me twice, up close. Aw, man. We look all the same to whitey, anyway. He'll never pick you out, jiver. I'm gonna fuck you lady. You're strange. Paul! Paul! Paul, is that you? Ah! Oh! Mr. kersey, I'm inspector mankiewicz. I know it's a terrible time. Any news of my daughter? Not yet, but as soon as we hear anything, we'll let you know. Mr. kersey, the descriptions you gave the officers about your attackers they're very unclear. Is there anything you can add? I came in this front door. There were two men standing there, at least two men back there. One of them hits me on the head and I'm knocked unconscious. Surely you saw one of them before you were attacked. Hey, I told your men everything I know. We understand that the same sort of thing happened in New York City, we ran it down in our computer. Yeah, that's right. Some muggers followed my wife and daughter home from the market. The police there got a very good description of the muggers, too. But it didn't do any good. We do what we can. Oh. One of my men found this on the floor. Honey, if they don't need us anymore, let's go to my place. They're going to be all night. Mr. kersey, we just got some news about your daughter. How is she? Is this your daughter, Mr. kersey? Mr. kersey, is that Carol? Get some sleep, darling. You go on back to bed. I want to stay here a while. I'll be along in a moment. Unto almighty god, we commend the soul of our sister, Carol and we commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of a resurrection unto eternal life through our lord, Jesus Christ. Don't worry about the new building, Paul. It can wait. Oh, I'll be back soon. It's not necessary. It is for me. Thanks for the use of your cabin. This is the new model, Paul. The department of building and safety approved it while you were away. Has Elliott chosen a building type yet. We've drawn up what the building might look like in three different renderings, so we could compare how they'd look. Call him up and make an appointment and I'll run it over. His wife'll probably make the choice, but we'll let him run through the motions anyway. Get me Mr. cass, at the radio station please. Our market is local news. Fires, traffic jams, droughts. I'm not so sure, Elliott. We've got our awards for international reporting. I don't give a damn about awards. Kbex's local news has kept us out of first place too damn long. You're the boss, Elliot. If you want, we'll take them on traffic jam for traffic jam. Oh! See you later. Why didn't somebody tell me you were here? Got some news for ya, your building's been approved. What's it gonna cost me? Well, we could get it in a steel frame and reflective glass, it'll cost you $250 a square foot. Wooden frame $100 a square foot. Concrete, $150 a square foot. All the figures are right here. I can't believe these prices. Welcome back. I see you made a noisy comeback. Hello, yeah, go ahead. I heard you were in the building. I was just gonna drop by and see you. See you tonight. Oh geri, you know, I don't feel like I'm fit company for socializing. Not yet, anyway. Paul. Are you out there? - Come on back! - Okay. Mr. kersey, 1 was at your office, they told me you'd be here. We were hoping you'd come down and look at some mugshots, see if you can pick out some of those people that were in your apartment. You know, it happened so fast. No, I don't think so. The pictures might jog your memory. There really isn't any use. My heart's desire and prayer to god for Israel is that they might be saved. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord "Jesus and shall believe in thine heart "that god hath raised him from the dead, "thou shall be saved. "For with the heart-" - what are you looking for? - Looking for a room. No trouble here, you hear. $50 a month. No TV, no music after 11. And no police, mister? Kimble. No police, you hear? I hear. Shall I join you? Oh, it's you. Who were you expecting? Raquel Welch? What brings you here? I thought I'd come and see you. It doesn't happen too often these days. Half my wardrobe"s here. I'm getting very bored with wearing the other half. Geri, I'm gonna be a while. Why don't you go on with what you're gonna do? I'll see you back at the office. Thank you for calling general lock company. Hello, yes. I have some locks here that need changing. Could you do it for me today, please? That's them, there they are. Let's go. You and you, out. Not you. Do you believe in Jesus? Yes, I do. Well, you're gonna meet him. Mr. kersey, do you wanna join the party? No, thanks. Area of San Francisco killed, three people and wounded over one thousand. Hello. You're in. I've been in all night. I called. I haven't been answering the phone. Those newspaper people keep calling ever since... Well, I just haven't been answering. Can I cook dinner for you tomorrow night? Friday night's better. Friday night, then. Okay, night. Two men were shot dead in the now vacant Hollywood hotel on Hollywood boulevard. Police believe the two deaths are drug-related. Names are withheld pending the notification of the families. Six, yes, six free films to go with for your camera. It's 9 o'clock here in Los Angeles. The temperature is 72 degrees. We'll go over to Jane Saunders for the traffic. There's a hold-up on Hollywood boulevard at western where a traffic accident has tailbacks for half a mile. So drivers, be sure to avoid Hollywood at western. That's it, kiddo, give 'em the local news. Of course, in my case, my car's such a mess anyway, a few more bangs wouldn't make much difference. Now, here's geri Nichols with news of an experiment in Illinois that's taking young people away from crime. In Illinois state prison... J; Over the hill and everywhere j go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born j thou would not be a sinner j; I'll tell you the reason why j' praise the lord j hallelujah No! Stop! Come on. Stop! Stop! Stop, please, no! I will be good. Mary! We're just borrowin' your mama, motherfucker. Don't hurt Mary. Keep back! No, please, please. Hey, watch out, asshole. Goodbye. Hey, over here! Hold it a minute. Let me get this straight. Some guy pops up out of nowhere, he starts shooting, and you and your wife don't know what he looks like. That guy saved our lives, damn it. Where the hell were you guys? Giving out parking tickets? Hold him. All right, lady. What did he look like? He was uh, he was... He was a very good citizen, that's what he was. He was a killer. Now you want to stay here forever, play it that way. You're vital witnesses. Now don't play games with me. You both saw him. Now I want a description. He's 21. Blonde with a club foot. Funny, from where I was, he was a large black man with a red beard. Now, you let these guys get me to the hospital or I'm gonna give the press interviews you won't believe. - Take him. - Close it off upstairs. I said close it off. You know what we've got here, don't you? A goddamn vigilante. My wife goes to mace class, would you believe that? The police commissioner's wife at mace class learning to spray attackers. Now you tell me there's a vigilante out there. My god. The lid"s only just kept down as it is. I can just see all kinds of panicked citizens taking to the streets if this gets out. They'll knock off anyone with long hair or tacky clothes. I think that I can find him. If we even start an investigation, the press will hear of it. I learn half of what goes on in my own force from the newspapers. Tell me... Wasn't there a vigilante in Boston about five years ago? - New York. - New York, right. Get on to them, see how they handled it. It stopped there. Well, what about this report? You've- =t know. The Los Angeles police has asked for advice on the vigilante situation. But there's something else you should know, sir. Paul kersey now lives in Los Angeles. Are you suggesting that kersey's out there killing again? Paul kersey was an interesting man, so I kept a loose tab on him. He worked in Chicago for a while, where he met an old friend of his who ran a radio station in la. And he transferred his business out there. That doesn't mean that he's the Los Angeles vigilante. No, sir. But, Christ, what if he is. Yes, sir. If he is, and if he's caught, the trail leads straight back to us. We had him and we didn't prosecute. For damn good reason. Street crime was down 5090. Never mind that, commissioner. We know we'd have a martyr on our hands if we brought him to trial, but the fact is, we let him go. If he's caught now, he'll tell the world that we let him go. I'd be disbarred. It'd be the end of your career, Mr. commissioner. And you, inspector, would not collect your pension. And I retire this year. It's quite simple. We have to get him before they get him. We? You. Well, I could go to Los Angeles in answer to their request. And I'll try to find out if kersey's up to his old tricks again. If he is, I'll try to stop him. Quietly. Kill him? Hi, frank, over here. Mike, good to see you. Frank, welcome to L.A. Thank you. - Gesundheit. - Thank you. Is this the file? Newspaper clippings and police photographs on Paul kersey. Most of them, of course, are about how his daughter and housekeeper were killed by muggers. We checked out every person who suffered a loss through muggings in the last six months, particularly in death. How many people did it give you? Deaths, 96. Seriously injured, 1,500. Rapes, 579. I can go on. You tie down a lot of men that way. What did you do? We tried that route. But we gave up. I'm going back to the hotel, I want to lie down. I think I caught a cold on the plane. And the smog doesn't help anyway. Hey, babe. You're not holding out on me are you? Hey, one cop to another. Would I do a thing like that? It's all right, miss Nichols. - How did you get in? - It comes with the job. You'd be amazed at the things they teach us. What's a New York cop breaking into my apartment? It's about your friend, Mr. Paul kersey. How do you know him? - It comes... - With the job. He killed nine people in New York City four years ago. You're not serious. I'm very serious. What station are you from? West 75th street. Ah, ah, ah. It won't help calling anybody. They sent you, didn't they. Well, not exactly. Was Mr. kersey charged with killing nine people? He was not. See, the people he killed were muggers. Even though the public never knew who he was, he became a hero. And there were those that felt we should encourage him to stop and leave it at that. But now, you see, he's doing it again. Here, in Los Angeles. There's no one I can call to verify all this? My chief thinks I'm on vacation. You break in and tell me vou think Paul's a murderer. What else are you entitled to tell me? We think it would be better if he stopped. I asked him once, it didn't seem to work. I think maybe he'll listen to you. I hardly ever see him outside of the radio station. Doesn't it make you wonder what he may be doing at night? Hey, mister, got a half hour to spare? What's wrong you, haven't you got one? Fuck you. Paul, where have you been? I was just out. =out where? I was with a friend. =a man. What man? Calm down. Where do you think I've been? Killing muggers. You're crazy. A New York cop broke into my place tonight. Not that... What the hell's his name, frank ochoa? He said he talked to you once. He told me that. Yes, that's true. That you killed muggers? No, that he asked me not to. Why would he ask you not to if you weren't doing it in the first place? Listen, when a policeman finds a killer, what does he do? They arrest him. Well, he did seem a bit odd. Not only odd, the guy is crazy. It's that simple. He had a moment in his life when he was a somebody. He was in charge of the vigilante killings in New York. He was all over the newspapers, the television, asked a lot of questions. The most important question they asked him was, "who is the vigilante?” "Have you found the vigilante?" Of course, he hadn't. And me, I was one on a long list of people who had family killed by the muggers. For all I know, he might have accused every one of them. He became such a damn pest that I left New York. But I'll be damned if I leave Los Angeles. I'm not gonna let him come between you and me. I thought things had. What? Come between us. Hell, no. Stay the night? I thought you'd never ask. Do I get a key again? Oh, yeah. Here, you can have it copied. Now don't lose it, we may not be able to get back in tonight. Oh, I can't see you tonight. - Why not? - It's Judy's birthday. I'm staying over with her and carmella after the party. Now who's keeping us apart? Hello. Frank, hi. Mike. I hate to ask you this after you've been so helpful but could you do something for me tonight? Yeah, go ahead what is it? I want you to take my car and park it outside the front of Paul kersey's house. Police! Follow the bus. Proclaimed by god himself in the holy scripture. He's the prince of the kings of the earth. One of these days he'll be called king of kings. Yes, heir of the heirs, prince of kings is just the beginning of his glory. We must confess in god that if thou shall confess the lord Jesus with thy mouth... You run in there with your automobile. You run outta gas and go to the filling station. You go in there on Sunday morning and fill your car up. Taxi! Come on, will you? Follow that bus. It isn't moving. When it moves, follow it. What do we do now? We wait. Achoo! - Can I see something there? - Stop it! Stop it! Just let me check the color. One second. Damn! I really am a nice guy but vou act like fools around me. Now, that bus there. I hope you got the bread for this. This is police business. I ain't known for my community spirit. Show me some money. Here, start with this. Go ahead, will you! Stop it! Come on, leave me alone. Give me a break, you guys. What's down there? =point fermin. What's that? One of those historical monuments. There's nothing there this time of night. You wait here. You get the other half when I get back. Whatever happens, wait here. If you hear shooting, don't worry. It's just target practice. What's happening, old man? Where you been hiding out? Whoo! All right, this is the shit. Let's see the stuff. Show the man. =this is the best. This stuff is sweet like sugar. Watch out! What the fuck is going on? Over there, man! What the fuck's this? Fuck it, man. I'll be damned! You? You stuck your neck out for me? It was you or them. - Did you get them all? - One of them got away. Get the motherfucker for me. Our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. He's dead. Poor bastard. I knew he was holding out on me. Lieutenant, over here. Listen, I'm at point fermin in San Pedro. We need more photographers down here. Who blew away the cop? I'm bleeding, man. Who did it? No sign of the cab that called in. Cab service said he was just passing by, he didn't see anything. They just want to stay out of trouble. Listen, you're gonna die right here if I don't hear who killed that cop. Nirvana. He got away. Who's that? =nirvana! Nirvana. Charles Wilson. Oh, fuck! Put out a tracer on nirvana, also known as Charles Wilson, for murder. No hurry. How can an entrance door cost 500,000 dollars? Your wife is a very expensive designer. She wants Italian marble, Mexican mosaic, sculpted angels blowing horns on either side of the doorway. It costs a lot of money. But here we've drawn it up in concrete. Even has the angels on either side of the door. It costs a hell of a lot less. Why don't you ask vour wife about it? - She'll hate it. - Ask her anyhow. Let me know one way or the other, will you? Do you know what time they're gonna make their move? Ah-=-ha. Well thanks, sergeant. Will you please keep those calls coming in? All right. Hi Fred. What's happening? There was a big shoot-out last night at point fermin down at San Pedro. Five people killed including a New York cop. Our manner department said that the tac. Squad's been called in. I want you glued to those police monitors. Glued. A man called Wilson got away from the shoot-out last night. The word is they may move to take him this afternoon. If they do, I want someone there. We could use a good exclusive. Say Fred, where do you get these monitors? We adapt them ourselves. Lots of people do. Happen to have a spare one lying around? There was one we were gonna get rid of. Uh... Here, we've got better ones now but this one still works pretty well. A gift from kabc radio. The tac. Squad, they operate on this band and they identify with 3a-90. The truth is, their programs are a lot more interesting than ours. Thanks, Fred. Yankee Charlie available and will handle. 3a-68, subject's residence located as 914 philmore. Units moving into position. 5h-13, this is 3a-90. We could use a definite 10-20. Affirmative, 914 philmore. Stay clear. No units to move until I give the word. Squad three moving into position, over. 5h-13, this is 3a-90. We have eyeballed your 10-30, over. Has he spotted you? Negative. We're across the streert from the 10-20. Can take him now. Hold it, he's mine. Standing by. 3a-90, this is 5c-61. Sir, they just entered 10-20 with two exits. 3a-46, subject lighting object. Appears to be narcotics. Permission to move in. Negative.

Hold him down. == How was the birthday party? We're getting a bit old for birthdays. - Have you seen this? - Oh, yeah. I saw it. Do you know anything about it? No more than you do. I understand your station, kabc, got an exclusive this afternoon when they caught the guy who killed him. I heard it in the car. Have you eaten? No, I drove straight here when I heard the news. Let's go to a nice place tonight. Okay, but I'd like to freshen up first. How long will it take you, about an hour? About that. I'll pick you up in an hour. You know, I rather liked him. He was nutty, just like I told you. At least they caught the man that killed him. See you later. Prosecution has presented only circumstantial evidence that Charles Wilson was the person that shot and killed detective frank ochoa on the night of may 14th. It is proven that the defendant attacked several police officers on may 15th but psychiatric testimony indicates that he was under the influence of pcp, a mind-altering drug. Charles I. Wilson was remanded to the mclarren state hospital until such time as the medical examining board finds him fit to resume his place in society. I suppose this is the Dr. Clark that's gonna turn him into a little angel. Would a normal prison do any better? It would keep him from killing somebody else for a while. Is this all the stuff that's going into your article? When's it come out? I've got a couple more sessions at the hospital. It's due to go in the July issue. Do you really believe all this? Yes, I do. You might, too, if you heard Clark. You think he could swing me over. If you met him, you might learn something. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Dr. Clark, this is Mr. kersey. I'm so glad you wanted to come along. The more people that understand our work, the better. I appreciate your letting me come. Say, doctor. Where is the men's room? Let me show you. You go straight down the hall, around the corner, and second on your left. Thank you. The right. Would Dr. Ferguson report to the intensive care unit? Dr. al Ferguson to intensive care. You're late. Look, they gave me the cover. How about that? "Next month, geri Nichols on crime and punishment in Los Angeles." That's terrific. Do you think Elliott will give me a raise? He might give you a reduction because of all the hours you've spent at the hospital. Well you've spent enough time there. You must know the place nearly as well as I do. Yeah, but I'm still not converted. All those theories are just that, theories. Dom perignon? Enjoy your lunch. Can't be my birthday that was last month. And you forgot. But that's all right. Will you marry me? Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. Jy you're not sick? Might be after I see the check, but I feel fine now. Easy, easy. This stuff costs $3 a drop. That was a $9 kiss. I accept. That'll teach you. This is the way it will go. Next Wednesday, we'll catch the midnight flight to acapulco and get married in Mexico. And I thought you weren't a romantic. After the program you drive to my place, then off we go. Let's get smashed. Then I want it in writing. I know it's ridiculous. Excuse me? I'm looking for a patient, Charles Wilson. I believe he's in c block. Is that right? Yeah, c block, section 6, room 30. - It's that way. - Thank you. I'm Dr. Carter, court-appointed therapist for Charles Wilson. They don't have vour name down here. My appointment"s for 9 o'clock. They usually give me a list with doctors coming through. I was told a Mr. Kay would be on duty. That's me, but I can't let you through unless... Well, Mr. Kay, I'm already late. I'd like to finish up and get home to dinner. Now if you don't mind, would vou please show me to room 30? Hi, Eileen. Cook it all by yourself, did you? That's right. If you don't want to stay for dinner, just punch 3600 to get out. 36007? I've got to take the doctor down here. Enjoy the food, then. Will Dr. dick middlemass please go to ward 16? Dr. middlemass to ward 16. Do you want to use the interview room here or see him in the cell? This will do. What's that back there? That's the electro-shock room. Since you fellas took over, they don't use it much. It's all done with kindness now. Isn't that right, doctor? Therapy. Call it what you like. Okay, Wilson. You got a visitor. Let's go. You know the routine. Do you want me to stay? It's not necessary. If you need me, just pull this. I'll get my dinner. I said to my wife where do vou want to go for your anniversary? She said, "I want to go somewhere I've never been before." I said, "try the kitchen." He raped and killed my daughter. I read about it. I'll give you three minutes 'til I ring the alarm. You're wasting time. To open the door you punch out- - 3600? - That's right. Hey man, what's wrong with you? You got a problem or somethin'? What's your fucking problem, man? Hey, man, watch this car, will you. Paul. That ends our presentation of "music on the sweet side” for now. But I'll be back at midnight with some relaxing, restful sounds for your late-night listening. Kabc news time at 10:30. The murder of Charles Wilson at mclarren hospital has just been revealed by authorities. The murder took place tonight of the man accused of murdering New York policeman, frank ochoa. Charles Wilson was undergoing psychiatric treatment at the hospital. It is not clear at this time whether the killing was by other prisoners but there seems to be evidence that a man entered Wilson's cell disguised as a doctor. Gang warfare downtown Los Angeles tonight turned into looting and violence against the police... Kabc radio news for Tuesday, October the 10th. At a press conference this morning inspector mankiewicz denied that two murders in downtown Los Angeles were the work of a vigilante. But rumors still persist that the spate of street killings, by a person unknown, may be by a citizen turned vigilante. - My wife wants it, we'll have it. - You got it. You don't put up a building every day nowadays. Hey, Paul, we've been pals for a long time. Yup. I know geri's going must have hit you. - Have you been drinking? - Hey, you know better than that. Where in the hell have you been at night? I've called you dozens of times. Well, I don't often answer the phone. It rings, sometimes I answer, sometimes I don't, but I'm fine. Betty's giving a "new building" party next Thursday. We'd like you to join us. I'll be there. Are you sure you're free? What else would I be doing?
