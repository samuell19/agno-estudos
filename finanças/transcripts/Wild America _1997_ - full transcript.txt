Marshall: No matter how fast I ran or how far, I never got away. But I didn't die. I wouldn't give them the pleasure. Sure, there are two sides to every story, but not this one. This is my story. The story of how I made it. How I survived my big brothers. Don't even think about touching that belt till you reach 15. Marshall: They said this experiment would cure my fear of heights. I'm not sure that I ever had a fear of heights. That is, until they started putting me up here. They were most dangerous when they had a camera in their hands. They had a camera in their hands a lot. My big brothers told me these experiments built character. They said it was for my own good. Mark: This is for your own good. - Okay? One, 1000. Get ready to fire. Two, 1000. Marshall: Most of the time, they were fairly normal. Marshall: Six, 1000. - Six, seven... Bombs away! Eight, 1000. Nine, 1000. All right! Marshall: I got used to the firecrackers. I had to. They said every good movie needs an explosion. Marty: Fourteen, 1000! Mark: Yeah! Yeah! Way to go, Marshall. You beat my record by three seconds. Yeah. That's great, Mark. Marshall, you better not be thinking about dripping water through this house. If you boys have been throwing firecrackers in that pool again, I'm gonna beat your butts till your nose bleeds! Marshall: Mom loved wild animals. We had lots of them. Most of them were orphaned or hurt. In fort Smith, we were known as the people you took them to. But of all the animals we took care of, my favorite was Leona. She'd broken her wing. But with my help, I knew she could fly again. Marty's favorite guy was Ernest Hemingway. He liked to think of himself as a great hunter and adventurer like Ernie-Bob. Mark's favorite guy was... Mark he liked to think of himself as a man of action, and a handsome ladies' man. Marshall: Me? I was a dreamer. I'm thinking dinosaur. Rabbit lying down. Could be a hog head. Big old skunk. Or a turtle. Chevy bumper... Marshall: Leon had been in the air force with my dad. They used to patch up fighter planes, then dad would take them up and test them. After the war, he followed my dad home and lived with us ever since. Bushel basket gold spud. Nope, definitely a rabbit laying down. How's her wing coming? I wanna fly with her someday, Leon. You will too, Marshall. I believe you will. I better finish my chores. Your daddy's coming home tomorrow. Marshall: It wasn't a fighter or anything. Just an old army trainer. But me and dad called it the skybolt. Dad was fixing it up so we could fly together someday. He picked her up for 300 bucks and a carburetor for a '52 buick. Man, I loved to sit in her. I'd fly everywhere, see things no one had ever seen before. Dad said my legs weren't short, the pedals were just too far away. Stouffer, this piece of crap is never gonna be ready for Saturday. Be there and find out, D.C. You be there to watch me kick your butt. - Oh, yeah? That I'd like to see. All you're gonna see is my tailpipe. Mark: Marty says now that he's graduating, he's going out to Africa to shoot big game, just like Ernie-Bob Hemingway. - Ain't that right, Marty? - That's right. At least I don't plan on hanging around here dipping carburetors for the rest of my life like Mark. Quit fooling yourself, stouffer. You ain't going nowhere. Julie Anne: Hey, I'll try a sip of that. Hey, Julie Anne. Don't waste your time with that root beer, girl. I got the good stuff right here. Have yourself a taste. Hey, hit the lights. Showtime. Marshall: There were two movie theaters in fort Smith. The starlight on main street and our garage. Marshall: Everyone had their favorite parts they liked to watch over and over. Especially the dangerous stuff. Like when Marty skied through the ring of fire. Yeah! Marshall: Marty loved it when everyone laughed. They always laughed the loudest when Mark blew me up. D.C. supplied the sound effects. D.C. liked anything where people had a good chance of getting hurt. D.C. eight feet in the air! You are so mean. I like it. Marshall: My favorite was when Mark tried to fly. Check this out. Boy 1: Whoo! Boy 2: Whoa! Mark: Man, that hurt so bad. Marshall: Mark liked movie night for reasons all his own. While everyone else was watching the movie, Mark would practice his Romeo routines oh Julie Anne. D.C. Mark, good thing you landed on your head. Marshall: Even though they'd seen it a hundred times, they always laughed and cheered. It made Mark, Marty and me feel kind of good. Check this out. Outdoor life has an Indian story from some old trapper's journal. "And the medicine man said, 'in the land of eagle people, in northern mountains, far into the snow where trees don't grow, there is a cave filled with a thousand sleeping bears." Wow, you'd win every time you pull the trigger. Marty: "Up there, the vapors rise from the center of the earth and the snoring of the bears is like thunder that rumbles through the mountains." Mark: Run. Go. Come on, Marty, let's go! Marty sr.: Where's all our troubles? Agnes: Out back, working. What's for dinner? Agnes: Fried chicken. Fried chicken and what? Lima beans, canned ones you like. Salad, peach pie for dessert. Store-bought? What do you take me for? Go clean up. Go and try to stop those boys of yours from working long enough to get them to eat. Now, go on. You said it was homemade. I said, "what do you take me for?" You know what a white lie is? It's when you say something other than the truth to make somebody feel better so nobody's feelings get hurt. Besides, with all the tobacco your father smokes, he wouldn't know the difference between something he paid for and the real thing. Get rid of that Marshall: When dad came home, things were different. He had his own set of rules, right down to who got what piece of chicken. Give your mother one of those legs. Salad. Mark, thank you. Marshall: The best part about dad being home was we could get down to business on the skybolt. Which meant I better know my stuff. Hand-check the ailerons, check the rudder, charge the Magneto, prime the fuel pump... How about the mixture? Mixture to full rich. Throttle? Fase the throttle forward. Flaps? Flaps to the second notch. Watch your tachometer. - Green is go. - Good. Dad? Tell me about the clouds. You slice through them like butter. Pop out the other side. - All you got's the bluest sky you can think of. - Birds get out of the way, right? They see you coming a mile away. Go to bed now, squirt. It's late. Good night, dad. Marshall: Most nights, we went to sleep to the sound of dad's singing. It wasn't really a lullaby. But it was the closest thing we had to one. J ...Get so dizzy they can't fly & j; Smelling that good ol' mountain dew j j my uncle bill's got a still on the hill and it's filled with that good ol' mountain dew j j the buzzards in the sky get so dizzy they can't fly & js smelling that good ol' mountain dew jj Your mom and me are paying bills today. Keep an eye on the squirt. And stay out of trouble. Go. Go right. All right, guys. All right. That was great. “Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo! Piece of crap, huh? This piece of crap just kicked your ass, D.C. Yeah, well, no wonder you won, stouffer. My truck outweighs this stripped-down crap by an easy 500 pounds. You know what? You are one sore loser, D.C. You wanna race fair, huh? Drag this behind your car. That'll be fair. With zero on it. Don't ever tell me what to do with my little brother, D.C. Marshall, get in the hood. I et's cha-cha. J oh, Suzie qj j oh, Suzie qj j oh, Suzie q baby, I love you j j Suzie qj j I like the way you walk j I like the way you talk jj Marshall: There was something about them. The way they moved, the clothes they wore. They were college girls. Mark: Ooh. Is that the Stewart sisters? Yeah. They're back from school for the summer. Gosh, they've really grown... Up. I saw that Mark: You saw what? I et's do it! - Let's go again! - Like hell you'll go again. Who won? Marty: Yeah! Ha-ha-ha. - Are you all right? - You could have killed him. - Ah, you're fine. - He's fine, huh? - I'm fine, Marty. You guys are great. Yeah? There's no way we'd see guys doing stuff like this at the university. Damn, all boys there ever do is study or throw footballs. It takes an imaginative guy to think of something like this. The kind of guy who'd consider shooting out streetlights quality entertainment. The kind of guy who'd risk his little brother's life for some stupid race. Don't be an asshole, Marty. You're right, Donna Jo. It was stupid. - Ilt was a dumb idea all the way around. - Grow up. And when you do, give us a call. Come on, tanna. You really think you had a dumb idea? Yeah that's cool, Marty. Real cool. I'm afraid to ask what's on this one. Mark. Clerk: I just got her in yesterday. “Wow. That's no home movie camera, boys. - That came from channel two in little rock. - No kidding? Yeah, ain't she a beaut? Yeah (go on, have a look through her. Careful. Yeah it's nice. Marty: Oh, yeah. Hey, bud. Ha, ha. - What? - Nothing. Mark, this could be it. It could be what? Our ticket out of here. With this camera, our stuff would be good enough for TV, easy. It takes more than a fast car to win a race, Marty. Marshall: One look at it and they wanted it more than anything in the whole world. I wanted to blow it up. Thank god we couldn't afford it we don't have that kind of money, Agnes. I'll bet the boys could do a lot with a fine camera like that. See the world. Film all kinds of things. Why give them hope in something that's never gonna happen? That's your own fault, daddy. Since they were little, vou kept banging it into their heads, "be your own boss. Work hard." Maybe nothing will come of it, but at least give them a chance. Chance to do what? - Throw hard-earned money down the drain? - Give them a chance to see what they can do. I give them chances, Agnes. Hell of a lot more chances than I got scraping this business together from nothing. I got inventory, I got contacts. This business is their future. It's what I worked hard to give them. Not a truckload of false hopes. It's not gonna happen, Agnes. Then I'll give them my Hawaii money. You will not give them your money. You've been saving that money for years. You will not give it away in a day. Agnes: I talked to your daddy last night. What did he say? He didn't I'll loan you that money with interest. Right now, I've got a truck that needs unloading. Marty: Wait up. I'll give you a hand. Marshall: It was pretty cool-looking. Real professional and serious. And on account of that, I thought they'd start making movies about new things and forget about me. Shh. Forget it. It's a Doe. So what? You hunt with us, you hunt fair. You're an asshole. Finish her. Do it! Do it, D.C. If you'd let me shoot when I had a shot, none of this would have happened. Mark: Don't worry, Marty. You did the right thing. Marshall: When the film came back, Marty told us it wasn't exposed right. We knew it wasn't true, but none of us said anything. Marty. You ever figure, if he had a camera, he'd have filmed them instead of shot them? What? Ernie-Bob Hemingway. Ever figure that? No I never did. What do you say, Leon? Name one thing uglier than these. I can. Clean hands and empty pockets. Marshall: Hey, dad. Can I blow the air horn? Marty sr.: You can do it twice, squirt. Coast to coast four times without shutting her down. Still good as new. Coast to coast four times without shutting her down. Still good as new. I need that trailer loaded by tomorrow night. Kiss his ass good. Maybe you can go instead of me. Um, dad? - Maybe I could go this time. - I'm taking Marty. - Yeah, but... - Dad, Mark can drive as good as me. When he's older. You're the one that needs to learn these runs. Marty: I gotta get the hell out of here. The whole time I'm dipping carbs, I'm thinking about what you said, Marshall. Can you believe that? About Hemingway killing animals. I wanna shoot them with this instead. Where would you go? First, out there. Then Africa. Well, what about Mark? Mark's gonna do whatever mom and dad want him to. Hey, Mark. Marty says he's leaving town. Mom and dad know? What? Rare wildlife birds and mammals. You name it, huh? Agnes: There are so many places to go. You talked to your father? Dad? I've decided I'm gonna move out. - Go on the road and film animals. Marty sr.: Three quarters. Marty: I figure I'll sell the movies. Make enough money to pay off the camera and travel all over. Well I just thought you ought to know. Marty sr.: You're not going anywhere. Yes, sir, I am. No, you're not. What'd you always tell us, dad? Tell the truth. Work hard. Don't be afraid of anything. Make your own opportunities. What'd you always tell us? You always said, "if you wanna go out and sell something, it sure as hell better be something nobody else has." That's the way you make your killing, dad. - Animals... - Rare animals. Who asked you? I'm going too. That's right. Rare American animals. People wanna see them before they're gone, dad. I mean, all kinds, right? Eagles, snakes, fish, whatever's getting killed off. Marty & Marty sr.: Beat it. Dad, Mark's right. People love animals. And we can get them on film. I mean, that camera is a tool. We need an hour of film good enough to sell to TV. We're not coming back till we get it. Mark's got two years of school left. That gives you the rest of the summer. I eaves me shorthanded (set out of here. Yes, sir. I say we go for the badasses. We film every endangered badass in America before there aren't any left to film. Check it out. There's even a list "top 10 most endangered predators.” alligators, wolves, grizzly bears. Screw the fish, right? Who's gonna pay money to watch a humpback chub or a... a shortnosed sturgeon? We gotta get the shots everybody else is afraid to get. The dangerous ones. Yeah, but mom would kill us before she'd let us film a grizzly, right? She doesn't need to know. If we're gonna film one, we might as well film a bunch, right? I mean, what if we found that cave of a thousand bears? Nobody else has ever found it. And if we do find it, we'll be famous. And this whole town can kiss our royal butts. Yeah. Yeah, one cheek at a time! That's right. Marty, let's do a blood-brothers sort of thing. Mark, we are blood brothers. Well, I mean, something so that, you know, when we're out there and start hating each other, we'll know that we don't actually hate each other as much: Right, huh? Marty: Okay. We're getting as close as we can to every living thing that swims in the water, flies in the air or walks on land. Mark: To the cave. - The cave. Marshall: Only an idiot would wanna have a ball of burning metal rolling down his back. But if they'd asked me, I'd have done it in a second. Where's Marshall? Agnes: Probably down at the creek with Leona. He's sad because he can't go. Dad's not coming out, Mark. Forget it. Mark: Yeah. It's not that he doesn't care. It's just that he's worried about you boys going off on your own. You boys drive safe. Don't wanna wind up in a fiery car wreck in the middle of nowhere. Agnes: Be careful. - Love you. Leon: Don't forget your camera. - All right. Let's hit it. - Oh, mom. God. Marty: Don't worry, mom. Mark: Say goodbye to the squirt, huh? Leon: Already did. Agnes: You boys look after each other. See you, Leon. Leon: See you. Js lookin' for adventure j j in whatever comes our way j j yeah, darlin', gonna make it happen & Agnes: Don't forget to call. Leon: They'll be all right. They're good boys. J fire all of the guns at once and explode into space jj what the...? See you later, suckers! You're gonna be back here in a week, boy, cleaning my carburetor and licking my boots. Do you hear me? Mark: We're freel Mark: "Then the crazed mountain lion dragged my screaming baby out of camp." But when I finally caught up, it had already chewed her little leg off. Blood was squirting everywhere. I threw myself on the beast and started beating it with my fists and then it turned on me. It sunk its teeth into my ear and ripped it away from my skull. I grabbed for my ear but it disappeared in one gulp down its bloody throat. - Then its claw punctured my eyeball..." - Stop it! Marshall: I can't take it anymore! Marty: Whoa! But, mom, I had to go. Without even talking to us? I've been worried sick, Marshall. Put Marty on. Where are you? Uh, we're about 20 miles outside of cotulla. We can put him on a bus. Mom, you'd go if you were me. You know you would, wouldn't you? Let me talk to your brother. I'm letting him stay. Wherever you are in two weeks, put him back on a bus. And, Marty, in one piece. All right, fine. You're gonna pay for this. Mark: "The grizzly toyed with me like a broken, bloody doll and started gnawing my fingers off. I tried to crawl away but its jaws sank into my leg and started dragging me down the hill, tearing my flesh over sharp rocks and bushes. Suddenly the bear's razor-sharp claws began shredding at my back. The bear was on top of me, its teeth crushing down on my shoulder, shattering the bones. I screamed. I could feel the bear's hot breath on my neck as it began licking at the blood gushing from my gaping wounds." Marshall: Cut it out, you guys. Guys. Oh, shit. The camera! It's locked try the window. Mark: Try that window. Hey. Marty. Marty, wait. Wait. Marty: Damn. - I filled up the canteens. Thank you. Here nope. Not thirsty. Marshall: This time, we weren't taking any chances. The sign said "sightings guaranteed.” Y'all lose one piece of my equipment, you lose your deposit. Better watch out for that big old bastard out there. Nighttime's when he likes to feed. Sucker ate my dog. Ate him in one bite. Then he came after me. I pulled my knife... But he only got my leg. Ow. You know what makes them the meanest animal alive? The tail. One solid muscle, bigger than your whole body. One whip of that thing and that gator's out the water and its teeth are sunk in you quicker than you can spit. Ptooey! Mark: What do you say we go down to New Orleans after, huh? Have ourselves some fun? Marty: Trip's not about fun, Mark. Mark: Yeah, but it's not not about fun either, is it? Marty: Just get the bait ready. We gotta get one of these guys eating something, otherwise it'll just look like a log. Okay, kill it. I think I saw something move. Throw the bait out there. Oh, shit. - What? Just throw some more. - There isn't any more. Marty: What? You mean you threw all the meat? - You just told me to throw it. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. Marty: What are you doing? - Give me a hand here. Marty: I don't know about this okay. Marty: Easy, now. Aah! Marty: Mark! Mark: Scared you, didn't I? Heh. Oh, brother. Mark! Marshall: Marty? Marty, I don't see him. Ah come on. Come on! Do you see him”? Mark! Marshall! Toss me the knife, quick! Quick! Guys, swim here! Marshall: I dropped the flashlight. Marty: Where's Marshall? - Oh, my god! - Marshall, come on! Swim faster! Swim! Let's go, Marshall! Come on, buddy! Come on, Marshall, now! Marty: Swim, buddy! Come on! Come on! Well, we got the flashlight back. Thought for sure you fellas would be the big guy's supper tonight. - We almost were. - Well, you're lucky, then. Because all of a sudden, splash, chomp! My buddy Phil could tell you a story all about that. Please, mister, no more stories. Phil and me, we served in Korea, just fell in together. Me telling stories about gator hunting back home, and Phil telling tall tales about bears. What kind of tales about bears? Crazy things. Like about a big cave where a bunch of them all sleep together. Marty. - Did he say where this cave was? - Out west, all's I know. Where can we find this Phil? He's in the house. In the house? Yeah come on. Come on in. Phil! Come on, boys. My buddy Phil came here a couple years back looking for a pair of gator-skin boots. Phil, man! Where you be? He right over here. Phil just didn't get himself a pair of gator-skin boots. What he got was a whole dang gator-skin suit! Mark: Look, the cave's real, Marty. I know it, we can find it. Mark, the guy was crazy. Nothing wrong with being a little crazy. Hell, look at us. Heh. Are you with the circus? Well, actually, we're filmmakers. I hope you film better than you juggle. Sarah had an acting part once. Sarah: Shh. - Really? Miss Devonshire cream, '66, paid her 50 quid. Shh. Go on, show him. Show me. Devonshire cream, the creamiest cream. They paid you for that”? It's not so easy. You try it with a camera in your face and a cow sniffing around your bum. Mark: Show me again. Sarah: I'm a professional. I don't work for free. I'll buy you a milkshake. Get it to go. Are you sure this is a nude beach? It is now. Turn around. J bend me, shape me any way you want me j j long as you love me... j Marshall, stay here, guard the equipment. J bend me, shape me any way you want me j j you got the power to turn on the light & J everybody tells me I'm wrong to want you so badly & j badly ij Marshall: Leaving those girls was pretty hard for Mark. Marty. Marty, we should've gone with them. I mean, there's plenty of animals in New York. No, not the kind we're after. Speak for yourself. I like to dream j Marshall: Just because the alligator man was a nut didn't mean that bear cave wasn't real. And come hell or high water, we were determined to find it j anyplace it goes is right j j goes far, flies near to the stars away from here & j well, you don't know what we can find & js why don't you come with me, little girl on a magic carpet ride? J& j you don't know what we can see j js why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free j& j close your eyes, girl look inside, girl & j let the sound take you away jj Marshall: Home got further and further away. It was like we were three astronauts traveling on another planet. Devil's playground. I ast home of the wild American wolf. Mark: Move over. Come on. Marty: No, you move over. Move over, Marty. You move. How come you always get the shade? Huh? Everything you want, you always get, and I get what's left, right? I mean, whatever I wear, you've already worn. Whatever I do, you've already done. I'm tired of being left behind. Then why'd you come along, Mark? Because I didn't wanna be left behind. And I wanted to have some fun. I'm having fun. Aren't you? I'm having a blast. Guys. Oh, man. Mark: Uh-oh. Marty? Marty. Marty, look. This is great. Wow. Marty, you getting this? Cool. Marty, look. What the hell? Mark: This is great. Marshall: F-4 phantoms. Wow. Uh-oh, guys, I think they're coming back. Mark: Marty. - Get behind that Boulder. - Run for the car! - Run! Go, go, go! - Get in the car. Get in the car! Marshall: I'm getting in. I'm getting in. Marshall: Marty, start it. Marty: Film it. Film it! Mark: I'm filming. I'm filming. Marty: Did you get it? Mark: I got it. - Did you get it all? Ha, hal - I got it all. Got it all Marshall: I eona? Where's Marshall going? Mark: Marshall, what are you doing? - What's he doing, Marty? - I have no idea. Marshall: Guys. Mark: Is that what I think it is, Marty? What have we got to write on? Ma'am, do you know where we could find this bear cave? Um, could you be a little more specific? Woman: In the mountains of shadow. Above the elk, below the white valley, beyond the peak of arapaho, where the winter comes early. Marty: Arapaho peak. All: J get your motor runnin' j j head out on the highway j js lookin' for adventure j j in whatever comes our way j j like a true nature's child we were born, born to be wild j j we can climb so high I never wanna die j j born to be wild jj j born to be wild jj Marshall: Marty said it was a race between us and extinction, and nothing was gonna stop us from getting there first. So, what if a whole bunch come? They're endangered, Mark. It means there aren't a whole bunch. If we even film three of them in a cave, we've scored. - Scored”? We'd be dead. - Yeah, and, what, you're just expecting them to come down and lead us right back to the cave? You've got a better idea? No. The old woman said it was in these mountains someplace. She didn't say where. What's that? “This? This is bacon in a skillet to a bear. It's the sound of a dying rabbit. Bears can't resist it. That's right. You do it. Do what? “Just do it. I'm not doing it. I'l do it... If you give me the book. Give it to him. Marshall: I wasn't stupid. I knew they'd make me do it anyway. At least this way, the stories would stop. It's good! Just keep blowing! Yeah yeah. This is the spot. Okay. Set it up back up here. - Here? - Right there. Mark: Marty, I don't see any bears. They're coming. I can feel it. Yeah? Keep blowing! Hey. - Oh, wow. Marty. - Yeah, I see it, I see it. - Yeah? You getting it? - I'm getting it. Marshall: Hey, get a shot with me and the baby deer. See if you can get closer. Hey, Marty, that's not a deer. That's a moose, right? Yeah Marty, moose are dangerous, right? Shouldn't we get him out of there? Get out of there! Marshall! - Get out of there! - No, you! You're in the shot. Marshall, get out of there! Run! Mark: Run, run! Hey! Yeah, yeah, get out of there! Marshall! Marshall: Marty! J I'm just out of school I'm real, real cool... I et's cha-cha. J I'm a wild one, I'm a wild one ooh, yeah... j Marty, help me! Mark, get out of the way! J! Yeah! J - Mark, Marty, help! - Marshall, jump off! Mark, get out of the way! “What? Help! Help! Help! J ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one jj Marty, forget the camera! Marshall, jump off the moose! Marshall! Marshall: Help! Help! Marshall! Marshall: Mark! Marty! Guys! Help! Bigfoot? Marshall: Help! Guys! You boys ain't from around here, are you? Thanks, mister. Are you okay? Yeah? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. - All right. - Who the hell are you? Marty: I got it! I've got it all on film. It's dynamite. Best yet. Oh, come on, Marty. What's wrong with you”? Our brother almost drowned. I mean, he almost died. You're okay, aren't you, Marshall? Yeah I'm okay. Who are you? Oops. Those bears ain't dumb. - They're all fat and happy and put up by now. - Exactly. That's why it'll make it easy when we find this cave. Yeah sneak up on them. Sure, you will. Gonna walk on in and snap a picture of a sleeping bear. You do that and nobody's ever going to see it, or you either. Yeah, but it's there, up in the mountains. Big cave, a lot of bears sleeping there at once. No such thing. Bears sleep alone. No, it's real. We're gonna find it. Let's say you do. You ever seen a bear up close? Hmm? You never wanna, especially when they get waked up. - We're not scared. - Well, then you're stupid. Out here chasing some wild-eyed dream. Supposing you find that cave... And you looking that bear straight in the eye, and you wanting something... And he looking you straight in the eye because he wants something too. You willing to pay the price? Head on up to willing's peak and talk to old Carrie Stokes. She'll tell you about paying the price. We're gonna find that cave. We're gonna film those bears, and in time, mister, you can see iton TV. I ain't got no TV. You want to keep him two more weeks? Believe me, we'd send him home if we wanted to. - It's just that he comes in real handy sometimes. - "Handy"? What do you mean by "handy"? Put your brother on. Marshall, so you're having a good time, you wanna stay? Yeah are your brothers taking good care of you? Are you being careful? Course we're being careful. "Safety first," mom, that's our motto. Well, all right. Just call me if you need me, okay? I love you. I love you too. Bye. Marshall: We were two days into the high country, and we hadn't seen a living soul. And when we did, we wished we didn't. Marty: Hello? Anyone home? Hello! Mark: There's smoke in the chimney. Guys. Go away. I don't take visitors. We're fiimmakers. We've come to film bears. We heard there was a cave... No caves around here. We were told you could help us. I'm sorry. Mark: Um, ma'am... Look, we've come a real long way. You're letting the little one freeze. Come in and warm him up, and then you head back down the hill. I'll put some water on. - You guys see her face? Mark: Yeah whoever convinced you that this cave full of bears was something real was just playing with you. But you've heard of it? No. Bears sleep alone. That was my... My judd. He never came out of the place I got this. We were to be wed on his birthday, September 3rd. Tomorrow. I celebrate that day alone, every year, by laying flowers on his grave. I'm sorry. Take this. Keep it. - It belonged to my judd. - Thank you. You go home. You boys could get hurt real bad running around these mountains chasing old bear stories. Guys, she knows where that cave is. What makes you think so? Marshall: I just know. - What about the film? - Screw the film, Marty. Someone stole our food, money, sleeping bags, everything. Not everything. Look, we can't eat film, Marty. We can't sleep in it. We are screwed. Let's just call mom. She can send us some money. No, there's no money to send. We gotta rely on ourselves. Now we got dad talking. Hey, dad can send us some money. Yeah, maybe he could. That's right, Marshall. Maybe he could. - Dad's never flown a plane in his life. Mark: Hey, cut it out, Marty. He was only a mechanic, scared to death of heights, just like you. I said leave him alone, Marty. That's a lie. Dad's flown lots of times. Tell him, Mark. Look, Marshall, why don't you just get in the car, all right, buddy? What's this? You're Marshall's protector? From asshole to angel? I must have missed the great transformation. You never wanted to make this film in the first place, Mark. Why don't you go back to the shop where you belong... Grease monkey? My leg, Marty! Marty. Marty. - Oh, Jesus, Mark, I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. It's not your fault. Marty: It's no big deal, mom. He just fell off a mountain. Not a mountain. It was a hill, covered with snow. The doctor said you could send in the money. Yeah. We're leaving for home in the morning. - How's that feel? - Good. You're lucky you only got a hairline fracture. - You ever use crutches before? - Oh, yeah. - Okay, well, take it easy, now. - All right. Thank you. Keep the weight off that foot. Thanks a lot. Sure. Let's go, squirt. Don't ever call me that again. You boys have a place to sleep tonight? Yeah, we sleep in the truck, like always. You'll bunk here. Don't wanna be eaten by a bear. Wait, stop! Stop the car! What's today? “Who cares? No, no, no. It's judd's birthday, Carrie's husband. - So what? - So stop the car, turn around. - He was eaten by bears, right? - Yeah, so? So she said he never came out of the place they got attacked. She's gonna take flowers to his grave today. She's going back to the cave, guys. - Carrie”? - Flowers are gone. Guys, horse tracks. Marty: I et me see let me see. That horse smells those bears. Marshall, come on. Shh. Mark: Oh, man. Who farted? Marshall: The cave. What's that? Don't move. Timber rattlers. They're drawn in by the heat. Well, how do we get over them? I know. Marty: All right. - Here. Mark: Are you sure this is safe, Marty? Marshall: You sure this is gonna work? Marty: Yeah. Yeah? Why don't you go first to try it out? Fine I'll do it Mark: Be careful, Marty. Marty... Shake bites you, you scream, the bears wake up, and we all die. You got it? Mark: Let's go. Watch where you're going. Keep the light out front. Thanks. How do we even know they're back there? - Shh. - They're there. Sleeping like babies. What's that? Shh. It's just a Boulder, Marshall. It's okay. Listen. - What is it? - Marty? Marty, you know what that sound is, huh? Yeah I do. I know what that sound is. It's the sound of hundreds of sleeping bears ready to wake up and tear our faces off. Marty & Mark: Shh! There they are. This is it. They're all here. Marty... - Marty, we found it. - Oh, my god. They're everywhere. Marty: Oh, shit. They're all around us. What do we do? Oh, god. Mark: Marty. Marty! They're all around us. Marshall. Yeah? - Give me the flashlight. - Okay. - Shh. - Okay. Okay. Mark. Shine the flashlight down here, then turn it off. Take that, and that, and take that. I'm gonna count to three. That's when we do it. Ready? Okay. One two. Three. This is great. Jackpot. - Marty, we gotta get the hell out of here. - What, are you crazy? Shh. Shh! Js my uncle bill's got a still on the hill j j good ol' mountain dew j j and the buzzards in the sky get so dizzy they can't fly & j just smelling that good ol' mountain dew j Marty: Don't stop singing. All: J they call it that ol' mountain dew, lord, lord j > and them that refuse it are few ji j I'll hush up my mug if you fill up my jug & j with that good ol' mountain dew jj Marty... Marty, it worked. Way to go, Marshall. Guys... Let's get the hell out of here. Bat shit. They're waking up. Mark: Come on, Marty. Marshall: Guys... Marshall: Guys! - Get back! Hyah! Get back. Hyah! There you go. Go get it. - Oh, shit. - Marty! My camera. You guys go. I got a way out. Mark: Where is the show? - We just left him. - He said he had a way out. Marty, it's Marshall. Look! All right, Marshall! Stay right there. We'll come... You okay? - Huh? - I got the camera. - Screw the camera. - You sure you're okay? - You little shit. - Huh? You all right? Marshall: I rode up front all the way home. At last, the wheel was mine. Green is go. Tachometer, 1000. Air speed, 20 knots. Flaps to the second notch. Marty: Marshall, the brakes! Nice driving, zero. Marshall: One minute I save them from getting torn to shreds by raging bears... Two mailboxes and one sign later, I'm back to "zero." At least it's not raining. Marshall: If there was a way home without passing the dairy grand, I'm sure dad would've taken it. But there wasn't hey, look who's back with his tail between his legs. Hey, stouffer. Just in time for my oil change. You find any dodos? Ha-ha-ha. Ignore them, Marty. They're a bunch of idiots. Marty sr.: I want that truck dropped and in the shed before you go to sleep. - Trouble's back. - Hi, mom. - Is your leg all right? - It's broken. Agnes: Marshall, I missed you so much. Marshall: All right, mom. All right. We'll pay you back. You'll work it off. Now that you got that out of your system. - I got some hot apple pie. - Mom, I'll be right back, I promise. I eonal She got strong enough to fly away. She was a wild bird, honey. She didn't belong here. I eona. I eona. Marshall: If dad was never gonna fly with me, why would he name it...? Ero. I'm hauling a load up to Rochester. You boys got plenty to keep you busy. You ought to take Mark with you. He's the one you'll be leaving this gold mine to. Marty sr.: Since when are you too good for what we do for a living, Marty? Because if you're too good for this business, you're too good for the money it made. Too good for the house you grew up in, the clothes on your back, the food in your belly... And your new busted camera. You too good for all that, son? Dad. What? You ever fly a plane? Did you ever fly a plane? I've done the best I could by you boys. If it wasn't good enough, it's the best I know how. Agnes: Go ahead, open it. It's for all of you. Marshall: What is it? - Just open it. Bud said the film would be ready Thursday night. Mom... Mark: What's this? Keys to the school gym. I rented it for Friday night. We didn't get enough. It's never going to make a real show. Just look at it. If you like what you see, show it. If not, we'll play basketball. Guys? Marty sr.: What about the truck? Totaled. Marty sr.: The load? Destroyed. There was a fire. They were lucky to get you out alive. Thank god nobody else was hurt. Tell Leon you want the connecting rods. They're in the back shed. I saved them for a rainy day. Doctor bills and everything, it'll be raining pretty good. The guy in Pittsburgh will give you six bits a piece for them if they're put together. - Marty... - Agnes, I saved parts, not cash. We're gonna need some money. Come on, boys. You father needs his rest. Bye, dad. Marty, stick around. I'm counting on you, son. This could break us. These are older. Might take a little more elbow grease. Lots of folks coming to the big show tomorrow. Oh, yeah” I'm not gonna be there. What do you mean, you're not gonna be there? What's the point? We don't even have a film. Got a bunch of little pieces. You want to go make a fool out of yourself, be my guest. You know, I'll just... I'd rather stay here in jail, pounding rocks for the rest of my life. This isn't easy for me either. Marshall: You know what the great thing about these rods is? They don't chase you. No, I mean it. I mean, look at them. They just sit there. Maybe we should've made a film about these. Rods and carbs. At least it'd be in focus, not like that wolf you shot. It was in focus. Yeah, well, maybe you got lucky with the wolf, but what about that moose and alligator? Huh, Marty”? What about them? What about them” those are great shots. Maybe we should just stick to what we know, and that's dipping carbs. That's crap. We know film, we know cameras, we know animals. Oh, yeah? Where's that gonna get us in life, Marty? Huh? Where? Nowhere. You know, you're right, Marty. Film's just a big loser, anyway. The film's gonna be great. He'll be there. I hope so. Marshall: To this day, I don't know if it was the wind or I eona. But somehow, I knew what I had to do. Everyone has dreams. But life has a way of making us forget what they are. I wasn't gonna let that happen to us. Not to their dreams. Or mine. All right. Ahem. Mixture full rich contact. Marty! Marty, get up! Get up! Oh, my god. Fase the throttle forward. Flaps to the second notch. Oh, my god. Marshall! Green is go. Is Marshall up? - Not yet. - What's going on? Marshall! Leon: Marshall! Don't take off! It's okay. Leon's got him. Leon: Please, don't take off! Marshall, stop right now. I gotta do this, Leon. (Get in the car! Get in the car! Marshall, what are you doing? Flying, Leon. Well, fly higher! Leon: Not this high. Not this high. Not this high! Your daddy'd sure love to see this. He's gonna. Leon: What's wrong? What's wrong? Leon, fly her. I don't know how. Just keep the stick from moving. Mark, take the wheel. Got it. I don't see him. Oh, my god, he fell out. Oh, god. Marty: You're right. I see Marshall. I think he's laughing. He is, he's laughing. Leon too. No. Leon's screaming. Marshall, get me down! I'm gonna throw up! Tell me when we're home! What the hell is he doing? He's talking to dad. I think he's talking to all of us. Hey, Leon, did you see the look on my dad's face? Hey, Leon, did you...? Marshall: Maybe because I had dreamed it so much, I wasn't afraid. Or maybe because dad was with me. I don't know. But I do know, like dad said, we sliced through the clouds just like butter. Wake up, Leon. We're heading home. Good morning, everybody. Y'all just thought you'd take her out for a spin? Yup. Why? Had to. Agnes: Is that it? Yup. (Set down here. What do you think your father's gonna say? Probably "how's she handle?” I hope. Mom, I wanna go in alone. (Given the choice I'd take the bear cave. Dad. I think you got some explaining to do. It's really quiet. That's because he's dead. Dad killed him. You plan on growing old with us? I doubt this family's gonna stay together if you don't start letting each of us be who we need to be. "Work hard. Tell the truth. "Don't be afraid of anything." Isn't that right, dad? Why'd you let me believe we were gonna fly together? You know what a white lie is, dad? It's when you say something instead of the truth so no one gets hurt. Well, a lie's a lie. They hurt everybody, including you, whether you know it or not. I'm not gonna be in this hospital bed forever, son. What then? My guess, I'll probably go one-on-one with the belt. But that's later. What I'm asking you now is for you to cut Mark and Marty loose. Don't squash their dreams, dad. Let them go make their films. You telling me what to do, son? No, dad. I'm asking you. So, Marshall... How'd she handle? Marshall: Until just now, I never told anybody what happened that day between dad and me. Don't think they would've believed me. Just like they wouldn't believe what happened later that night if they hadn't been there themselves. Audience: Aw. Ohh. Marshall: Some people liked it. Marshall: Some people didn't like it. That's baby crap, man. That isn't scary. Marshall: Some people didn't care much either way. Stouffer. Stouffer. You should've paid us to sit through this piece of crap, man. Boo! Congratulations, son. I'm real proud of you boys. Thanks, dad. Ahem. Stouffer. We want our money back, man. You saw a pretty damn good show for your money, son. But here. Ahem. My treat. Donna Jo: You guys are great. I'm sure you got more important things to do than to watch silly movies about dumb animals. After all, when it comes to dumb animals, nobody knows more about that than you, D.C. Marshall: College girls. Move. We thought it was good. A little short, but damn good. It was brilliant. We're gonna finish the film, maybe sell itto TV. Maybe we'll get someone famous to narrate it. Yeah. Yeah, someone like Robert redford. Yeah - oh, groovy. - Groovy. Girls: Marshall, you were so great. Can we have your autograph? I need a vacation. Marshall: Another wonderful thing happened that night. Dad smiled. No one in that gym could've known it then, but on April 6th, 1977, the predators aired on nbc, narrated by Robert redford.
