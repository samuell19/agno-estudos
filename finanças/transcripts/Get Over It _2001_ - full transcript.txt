We'll... we'll start from the beginning, ok? It's... it's kind of hard to understand, but once you get into it, the story's actually kind of good. So, hermia, this girl here, she's very rich and beautiful and she lives with her overbearing parents in Athens. Now, hermia has everything a girl could ask for, cool clothes, nice complexion and her pick of pretty much any guy she wants. But of all the guys in the greater Athens area, hermia's heart belongs to the handsome young nobleman, lysander. [ Horse whinnies ] This would all be perfect if it weren't for Demetrius. Hermia's father already promised her hand to him, and he's just as charming and handsome as lysander, maybe even more so. Not to mention, Demetrius will stop at nothing to make hermia his bride. This pretty much leaves lysander screwed. All right. Got it. Uh, you make it, uh, very easy. We just started. Kelly, I'm not exactly trying to win an Oscar here. I'm just trying to get my girlfriend back. Thanks. Hi! How are you? Hi, new faces, how are you today? I'm Dr. Desmond forrest oates, fine arts chair and all that hoopla.

Felicitations, miss woods. Thank you so much. It's a lead role. I know. Methinks thou best not botch it. [ Giggles ] I remember what the wonderful Bobby de niro once said to me. Well, not to me, but I read it in an article. And it was considering landing the big roles, and what he said was, "just because god blesses you, does not mean there isn't another sneeze coming." Anyway, see you at Thursday's rehearsal. You, too. Uh, Dr. Forrest oates, that's... That's kinda gonna be a problem. See, next week we got all the, uh, basketball playoffs. Now, let me tell you something, bub. This is your theatrical debut! I want you to take it seriously! I want you to give it half the dedication, just half that I gave my own. To be or not to be. That is the question. [ Audience cheering ] Oh, those were the salad days. Although these are good. [ School bell rings ] Thursday, none of this, jock head. [ Both chuckle ] Let's go!

So in summation, lysander loves hermia, who loves lysander, but is betrothed to Demetrius, who in turn is the object of Helena's affection. [ Laughing ] Now do you see the fun of it? It's just all hell done break loose. Mickey Rourke said a wonderful thing about having fun. He was at some big soiree that Liza minnelli was throwing... Mr. Landers, how nice of you to join us. And thanks for not showering. What a super instinct. The secret to all this, you see, is that our four young lovers are not as in control of their romantic destinies as they think because in the woods, we have what? Fairies. Fairies! Fairies! Spirits! Spirits. [ Giggles ] Specifically, titania, oberon and puck. Little Steve. Steven. Who delight in manipulating their human counterparts... For sport. It really is fun to see a bunch of fairies being played... [ all laughing ] Holy shit, little Steve, you've got wings! Yeah, well, you've got fairy dust coming out of your ass. Come on, guys. Let's stir up some trouble. Oh, fair hermia, thou art so incredibly hot and stuff. Hey, red, follow us. You can't see us, but you'll do what we say. Suckers. [ Laughing ] Yo, dude, somebody's scammin' on your chick. Time to kick some ass. [ Laughing ] [ Horse whinnies ] Demetrius, what say you? Relent, sweet hermia. And you, lysander, yield thy crazed title to my certain right. En garde. What? There's no sword fighting in this play. Well, now there is. [ Both grunting ] [ Groaning ] Off you go. Ohh! [ Horse whinnies ] [ Hermia laughs ] [ Demetrius groans ] [ All laughing ] When it rains, it pours. Mr. Landers! [ Chuckles ] [ Students laughing ] Are we having r.E.M.? Musical Shakespeare? Calling my sister? She's helping me out. My sister? Yeah. She knows what she's doing. Uh, whatever. Berke. This isn't about her, all right? This is about you running after Allison.

I mean, look at that old lady from Titanic. She didn't never get over that. I'm not just talking about anybody. Look, you still take shop with dora Lynn tissdale, right? Yeah. Um, last week, she nearly took out half the class with a nail gun. So she's a bit clumsy. Thanks to good old dora Lynn, Dickie bergwell has to take a crap standing up. Dennis, we're not asking her to build an apartment complex, are we? And what makes you think she's gonna do it? Look, that's your problem, all right? I'll take care of berke. Dennis heard it firsthand. The girl's completely into you. No, that's... that's bullshit. Why would I make this up? I mean, I'm presenting you here with a golden opportunity, the Stanley cup of blind dates, New Zealand's gift to rosner high. I mean, those eyes, that mouth, the rack. [ Berke ] Aren't you forgetting something? Ohh! [ Felix ] Ok, yeah, she's a little accident-prone. [ Berke ] The girl's a walking disaster zone. Wherever she goes, bad shit happens. [ Girl ] Oh. Oh, my god! [ Berke ] I mean, weird bad shit happens. [ Screaming ] She missed six years at the high school. She was in a coma for Christ's sakes. [ Groans ] Berke, she's beautiful. Yeah. She's built. Yeah. And apparently, she's totally willing to lower her standards, so I really don't see anything wrong with this. It's your turn to get the ball. I'm not getting the ball. You get the ball. [ Whines ] Hey, uh, dora Lynn? Dora. Kinda got this favor to a... ask you. [ Yelling ] Favor? What kind of favor? [ Yelling continues ] [ Girl ] Just stop, drop, and roll! Berke, don't be nervous. I'm here because I want to be. Me, too. We never really had a chance to talk. Well, I think that had a lot to do with the fact that I was busy with Allison and you kinda had your hands full with the whole, uh... Coma thing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, berke, it's all about new beginnings. That stuff about me being bad luck? Ancient history. I'm moving on with my life, and you're moving on with yours. [ Chuckles ] Sorry.

So since curtain is, indeed, in three days, I'm now accepting offers from volunteers for the role of lysander. Ooh! Ooh! Put your hand down, little Steve! Ooh. No, not striker, you already have a role. Yes, I know, but I was wanting to nominate someone. [ Chuckling ] Oh, well, that's very flattering, uh, indeed, but I don't think a man of 34 can possibly keep up with you youngsters. Actually, I was referring to... Berke landers. [ Students murmuring ] Oh! Well, th... That's an intriguing thought. Any other ideas? Ooh! One that I might use? Put your hand down, little Steve! Well, he's green, to be sure, but he does demonstrate a certain... enthusiasm. I'm in. [ Students gasp ] You're in? Yeah, I'm in. Jessica, call domino's. We'll be here a while. And keep icing your front bum! Swelling continues when you don't ice, and I need you. Not really. [ Guitar music ] So how many swords do we have? Seven. Eight. I swear, if Allison doesn't appreciate this... then what? Anyway, I've heard you do the dialogue. You're fine. Yeah, but what about the singing? Well, the music sucks. Especially my song. Well, why don't you, why don't you rewrite it? Oh, forrest oates would never go for it. Kelly, you're the best one in the play. You know more about this stuff than he does. Yeah, but he doesn't see it that way. Forrest oates just cast me as a lead. He's an idiot, Allison. My name... Is Kelly. What'd I say? Allison. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. I'm sorry. Prepare to die. Maybe y... you shouldn't be playing with that. Put... com... put it down. Put it... k... Kelly. Aaaah! We have an 18-year-old white male with an anterior puncture wound to his left arm. My god, I'm so sorry, berke. I thought it was a prop. I wanna see it. No, don't look at it. It's pretty bad, isn't it? No, it's... it's fine. Here, listen to me, berke. The doctor's gonna fix your arm and I'm gonna help you rehearse and you're gonna be the best lysander ever, ok? And your arm, it's really not that... oh, my god!

Hi. I know you're busy, but I just wanna talk to you for one second. Oh, miss woods, please come in... ohh. Fun hair clip. Hmm. I wanted to talk to you about my song. Oh, "pocketful of dreams." I originally wrote that tune for miss Diana Ross. ♪ [ Disco ] Miss Ross! Miss Ross! I've written a very groovy song! I think you'd li... oh! That's my hand, buddy! Aah! Miss Ross! Miss Ross! Diana! Unfortunately, the lawyers got involved, and then bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. And then, uh, the next thing you know... phtt! No deal. It's a great song. I love singing it. Oh, it was fun to write. It's just that I was wondering if you... if you wouldn't mind... If I made a few suggestions. You've made s... some suggestions? "O weary night, abate thy hours." Well, i... I just figured, you know, like you said, the song really isn't working. [ Chuckling ] I'd like you to do me a favor, if you will, miss woods. I'd like you to read this poster and tell me what it says at the bottom. "No food or drink allowed in the auditorium at any time." It says, "12 original songs by Dr. Desmond forrest oates." Oh. [ Chuckles ] That part. Yes, that part. I'll tell you what it doesn't say. It doesn't say, "additional lyrics by little miss sassy-pants." You know, some of those lyrics are Shakespeare's. Ah. And what was the last tune you hummed from Macbeth? Bill Shakespeare is a wonderful poet, but Burt Bacharach, he ain't. [ Whispers ] I'll go. Sorry I'm late. That's... that's ok. I was just getting lucky. Oh, Chester! We need... we need... we need... We need to find this dog a date. [ Growls ] So, uh, how was... how was forrest oates? A bigger asshole than I thought.

[ Both chuckling ] Ok, this scene's between you and hermia. So pretend I'm Allison, ok? Sure. As difficult as that might be. No, go ahead. So theseus says, "go, wake them with their horns." And hermia says, "methinks I see things with parted eye, when everything seems double." Ok, I got it. Uh, my lord, I reply amazedly, half asleep, half awake. I came with hermia hither. [ Both chuckle] Our intent is to leave Athens... Mm-hmm. Where we may be married. And then there's the kiss... Which is gonna be with Allison. Right. But in this case... [ Phone rings ] [ Sighs ] Shit. What? Hey, let me take a shot in the dark. Berke's there, right? Felix, where are you? Big party. Hey, listen.

[ Instrumental music ] Hey, you. [ Sighs ] Sorry about this whole party thing. My brother is kind of an asshole. Kind of? I'm seriously considering telling mom where he keeps his porn. That was a joke. Kelly, why do you hang out with me? I mean, you probably have better things to do than to, uh, waste your time with a hapless loser. You're not a loser, berke. Allison thinks so.

We trust you. You're my parents, for god's sakes. Stop trusting me! Poor Judy. I'll go get the skimmer. Well, this is pretty interesting. It was nothing. Kelly, I was there. He kissed you, and I don't know why he did it. I mean, berke's pretty screwed up right now, but... Look, I kissed him, too. And, yes, he is screwed up, and he likes someone else, and it's a problem, but, Felix, it's my problem. Look, you'd know I'd be lying if I said I was happy about this.
