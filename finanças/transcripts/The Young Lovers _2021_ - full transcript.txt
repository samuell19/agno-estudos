LYON, DECEMBER 2006 Sorry. Sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing you for no reason. Breaths heavily. Who, Mathilde? I increased the dose of morphine. I do not feel pain. I'm sorry for the trouble. Are you Shauna? She told me about you. I'm her doctor. I'm friends with her son, Georges. Georges had to rest, so I replaced him... Everything will be fine. Please look me in the eye. Mathilde, you and I breathe the same air. Truth? Let's make the best of them. Small or big? I'll take the soup. I do not recommend. She's terrible. I do not doubt. I warned you. I've always liked the awful soups from the vending machines. Probably because you only eat it when you have to. Your brain associates them with the relief they give. I have to go back there, I can't leave her. The nurse will send me a signal... You know, Mathilde is... She is a very beautiful, cheerful woman. I know. Please wait. Is... like a sister to me. It's from another room. Of course. - Sorry. - Be right back. - How are its parameters? - There is no fever. All right? What are you doing here? I'm on duty. Go home. It's more important. Someone will replace you. It does me good. I need it. LYON, 15 YEARS LATER Damn it! That `s nothing. I will need it. - Why don't you take the ID? - Lost. I have no idea where or when. I took it out... - Today morning? - Yesterday evening. - Before dinner or after? - After. I took it out of... I found my calendar! Yes, George. I am coming. I'm looking for a passport! I lost you too. you're not helping! I am coming. Where was he? Where you left him. Brush wheel. Bye honey! Get dressed or you'll be late. - You don't look well... - Coronavirus! - Go. - Bye! The Dublin team will present the results of 30 patients. I found 12 patients in Paris. - And you? - Seven in Lyon. Let's start with a few. If the results are positive, we will apply for funding. Damn it! This is what you're looking for? He will die without me! You'll see, you can't do it without me. Pierre... - Need to go to dinner with the band? - Not. Then eat with me. I haven't been in this house for 15 years. Gets upset. I have a hotel booked. I am canceling my booking. It's an hour's drive. Tomorrow we will fly back as planned. You are a real buddy! "You can't do without me." Good morning! How do you do? I'm working as you can see. Just like everybody. Nothing has changed here. I can not talk right now. I'll call you back. Good thanks. Sorry. Good day. Do you have a free hand to shake mine? It's you! Sure. I didn't associate... - What? - Lady. We met at the hospital the night before... We shared the soup. I was Mathilde's doctor. I remember the doctor but he was younger than you. No wonder, that was 15 years ago! Even then, he looked much younger. Welcome. You twist the vowels and leave the consonants alone. - Watch your head. - My grandfather used to hang fish on this. And grandchildren! Only once. I wanted to save the mackerel. I accidentally dropped it. This rage! Grandpa, not mackerel. Rather drunkenness. Grandpa, not mackerel. - Would You like to drink something? - Yes thank you. that we have? It was hanging in our office. She hung her doodles on it. Did you grow up here? A great lady architect in a small house... My father was a foreman in a fish processing plant that went bankrupt. We came to France when I was four. Do you take dopamine? It stabilized. We lived in a shack. I decided that when I grew up, I would design decent houses where everyone would have their own room and a bathtub. I feel weird when I see her. I can imagine my mother at her age. I'm in Dublin for a conference. What about oncology? He's great. Hard-working... I can't accept that I'll end up with someone other than I started. Then look for the women you started with. The McMullens' daughter is divorced. She's free. - Do you know what she did to me? - Not. I wasn't 18, I was a virgin. She said I was cute and he will take care of it. She even had me get condoms. I waited for her for hours like a dog behind the processing plant. And what? I'm still waiting. She went to Cork with another sadist! With who? With Shauna's daughter, Cécilia, who showed me her breasts to prove to herself that we were friends. I spend my days at the microscope, waiting for microscopic particles to create something even more microscopic. The cells have exhausted my patience, nothing left for women. All right! Let's go to the pub. - I'll show you everything, Pierre. - Come on, it's raining. It's Ireland. Come on. I'll introduce you to Fiona a barmaid with a dragon tattoo. It's my sweetheart! She has two children and works in Cork. I do not believe! Everything changes. It's far, Georges. you'll catch a cold. Mathilde had a sense of humor too, but she got drunk sadly. The lady has disappeared. In the hospital. Before I came back from Paris she died. I blew it. Maybe she was waiting to die until you went. pierre, I think I remember you. Great! My wallet... Angus! Angus! Help with something? Cholera! I heard you calling. - Everything's all right? - Yes. Does it get lost often? He keeps running away. did i wake you up? I did not work. Damn it! - Have you lost anything? - Yes, keys. - I do not believe. - We'll find them. I lose everything. My son gave me this keychain thing that whistles. Such a gadget. How old? Seven. Daughter - eighteen. 11 years difference? We had a son on the way but died shortly after birth. I'm sorry. December 8, 2006. That's why you remembered me. We met four days later. Mathilde died on the twelfth. That's why you remember me, Pierre. Although he didn't get lost! We should hurry up. - Damn... - This is Ireland! I'll find you something. You designed it? Yes, but it was never built. My daughter wants me to throw it away, but I can't. - He's not coming here anyway. - But you live... ...in Paris. I come here to recharge my batteries. Increasingly. And her father? Dead. He was a great architect. We divorced quickly. hold. Thanks. What were you working on at 3:00 in the morning? Over Martha. She's a patient I love. She has a recurrence of breast cancer. It has already undergone reconstruction twice. She really wants to keep her other breast. I proposed a new treatment, an experimental one. I need to convince the lab and the authorities. is it risky? Perhaps he is wasting valuable time. Is she willing to risk her life for breasts? I am 38 years old. Is it less important for a seventy-year-old? I didn't say that, but I think that's a different case. Seriously? There are different criteria. For the doctor, some are secondary, important for the patient. We adapt. To aesthetic criteria? Sometimes. Especially when it comes to female breasts. Why? Because... breasts are beautiful. I guess I'm tired. I'll go lie down. The day I got married, I knew it was a mistake. He was cheerful, joyful, romantic, it was hard to resist him. He cheated on me every chance he got, but I couldn't throw him out. I was a coward and I hated myself for it. I ordered the men on the construction site, but near it I was weak. he was a bastard who thought I had beautiful breasts. Good night, Pierre. Shauna? Sorry. I forgot my toothbrush. Will you lend me? Yes. Thank you. Please. Do you also need paste? No, I'll take it from Georges. Thanks also for... Good night. Good night. go. Thank you, Shauna. It was really... Really. Will you let me know what's up with Martha? Yeah... What were you expecting? I get a text when he leaves class. Why not me? They probably think that's what a mother should do. They'll throw her out. They can't kick out the entire high school. Not very comforting. We broke up too. But we were not afraid of the future. - Will you call the school? - I'm already late. I'll deliver in three seconds. Hurry up. I will not rush to the cursed cells! - Shall we have lunch? - You won't make it! I took whiskey monkeys from the deck. I would prefer girls! She called me an asshole! Because you are. I am in contact with Dr. Sissoko in Paris. Her research involves 40 patients, like Martha. This will convince Vartilab to continue the first phase of research in France. This will mainly convince the Medicines Agency. Possibly both! You complain about long procedures and the lack of access to FDA-approved therapies. Have you convinced the whole team? Yes, Martha. IN 100%. But I also need to convince the lab to request approval from the Drug Administration for phase two. And that may take time. What do you think about it? I believe it will be a success. But you know what that means. It's your decision, not mine. First, I will help with research, and that gives it meaning. So to hell with the consequences, because it's the future and no one knows what might happen. You wanted me to keep you informed, so I got your number from Georges. This echo... - Am I disturbing you? - Not. I'm in the museum hall. In Cork? No, in Paris. are you back? I just wanted to let you know that I convinced the team and Martha agreed. Excellent. Have you started therapy? No, we still have an appointment in 10 days from the lab in Paris. It'll work for sure. By the way, I found your picture with Mathilde. - What? - You showed them to me at the hospital. I took them by accident. So it's you! I thought I lost them. Sorry. I was looking for you but... No, that's great. - Cool. - It was up there... Among... I miraculously found them. Do you want them? Why not? Since you'll be in Paris soon... I don't know if I'll have time. Excuse me, I have a patient. Okay. See you soon, Shauna. It was nice to hear from you. See you later. Goodbye. Good morning, Mrs. Loszinsky. I'm sorry I kept them for so long. Regards, Pierre. Marcel, stop! "Marcel, stop it!" What an asshole! "What an asshole!" Thanks for the photo. See you later. Hugs. Who is this? "Who is this?" No one. Patient. Looks like a hopeless case. "Looks like a hopeless case." We have been following her for three years, when a tumor was discovered in her right breast. Mastectomy, chemo, rejected implant, another reconstruction. He is 38 years old and has left breast cancer. He doesn't want to go through this again. She opted for experimental therapy. The patients are aged 26-41. They've had several surgeries. They want to avoid mastectomy, they are aware of the risks. Thank you. It's all very convincing but we can't break up. Can we contact you in phase three? They need therapy now. You cannot put profit before science. Georges, I think we can tell them. Have you collected the results? Functional tests have been completed. We can compare the results from France with clinical trials. Isn't this an opportunity for Vartilab to show itself? - When did you collect the results? - Today at eight. I've been drinking coffee all night with a bunch of atypical molecules! Are you coming back to Lyon today? And what do you suggest? This must be celebrated! I have something to do. we will come back here. You may have, but... Well, next time. Hall 2. They haven't put in yet. are you going? I'll buy a newspaper. - You want something? - No thanks. Hello, this is Pierre. Escande. Good evening, Pierre. How are you? Okay. I'm at the station and I wanted to take the opportunity to say hello. - Good evening. - You came to Paris? No, I'm leaving. I only came for one day to meet the lab. how did it go? Okay. Very good. They gave us the green light. For Martha. - Cool. - That's true. Excellent. And you? What are you doing? I'm home, going to dinner. Well, I won't bother. I just wanted to greet you. Well... Have a nice trip. Thank you. Good night. Hugs, Shauna. Good night, Pierre. Train number 6609 to Lyon... What are you doing? The train was cancelled. Got some time before dinner? am I interrupting? A bit like that! Oh no... Well, have a nice evening. I was responding to that visibility! Damn autocorrect! Great, for what? Message, not visibility! Come pick you up? I have a meeting at 9pm. Can we meet somewhere? Yes. Where? In Jarash. Not! In Jaures! Okay, I'll be there in 22 minutes. Not! Not upstairs! I am! Me too. Where? On the even side of the boulevard. I see you. We have 7 minutes left! I am almost 71 years old. Will you invite me to your birthday? Pierre, I haven't made love since... Can you wait a few more days? Because we have four minutes left. I'm not so sure. Did you date a man? No, my granddaughter is celebrating her engagement. Mom? My daughter, Cecilia, Pierre. Good evening. Pierre? Do we know each other? Let me think. Are you the son of... No it is not possible. I can't remember faces well. I don't think we know each other. Pierre is a friend of Georges. He was treating Mathilde. He even visited us in Kinsale. Yes, it's you! I regret, I could not be there. Georges reminds me of my childhood. I haven't seen him since... I left my papers with Shauna in Ireland, and since I'm in Paris... medical history a young woman who undertook therapy to save her breast. Exactly. Of course. Left breast. Everything okay, mom? Yes alright. I'll go now. Goodbye. Will you have dinner with us? - No why? I do not want to impose. You don't impose! Truth? Not. let's go. We'll be a little late. Do you like exotic cuisine? Adele, my daughter... and Kaushik. - They've been together since... -...seventh grade! Before my first period! You were so sweet! Let's go to the table. I am responsible for government emergency communications. I am available three days a week but by Hurricane Irma, covid and terrorists i have a lot of work to do. You're one of those people who sleep three hours a day. Tragedy is not an easy job. It's just like mine. Mine is just a wake-up call. The Lord saves lives. There's no comparison. Did Kaushik mention that I come from Chandigarh? Not. - My grandfather knew Le Corbusier! - Really? He was polishing his shoes. I don't understand why she asked her father for bail. I would help her. You've already helped her a lot, and it's not over. Pierre is great. He's a great doctor. I think so. I ordered you a taxi. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh well... Safe trip. See you soon. Actually... could you drop me off? Of course. Hi. No, wait! If I could be of any help, I know someone at the Ministry of Health. Please don't hesitate! - Thank you, Cecilia. - Bye, mom! Where? Drop you off somewhere? Wanna drop me off? Rue Ramponeau 19, please. I do the same. What? When I'm cleaning. I translate. Sorry for the mess. I did not expect... All right. I know I'm supposed to live in a spotless apartment, but... coffee? - I'll ask the same as you. - If I drink coffee, will be after me. Your daughter is lovely. He's worried. It's because of me. I was not a reliable mother. I spent half of her childhood abroad and the rest at work. sit down. Maybe you passed on your love of work to her. In any case, she became an exemplary mother. She's a wonderful woman. I don't understand why she's lonely. "Joy of life" or "Inner Harmony"? one by one? You want to go? Everything's all right. Whatever you want. I'll save my tea for tomorrow, drink it iced. She will be good. It's bad luck to compare hands. We're a little drunk, aren't we? A bit. Tired... A bit... Let's go to sleep. Yes. Do you have a toothbrush for me? Good night, Pierre. Good night, Shauna. All right? Hi. - You are! - Yes, what? Didn't you stay in Paris for dinner with the band? Not me... I had something to do here. With woman? Not... What is his name? Stop. Okay! I wasn't with my friends. I do not want to know. I can't lie. You can. I already betrayed you. More than you. What? When? - With who? - It's not important. With Georges? Not with him! You are the love of my life. We'll grow old together. Thank you. - You haven't forgotten anything? - We'll be back at the top. hold. At most? Mom... Come on. I'm dying of hunger. Have I missed them? By a hair. What are you doing here? I know you're not completely broken, but... I don't know when these 15 years have passed. Children grow up, a person does not pay attention. I remember how sometimes bedtime stories pissed me off. And now I'd give anything to hear him call out, "Mom! Story!". Her ways to get me back to my room: "I'm hungry, I'm cold, I'm afraid, I feel bad I lost my teddy bear!"... After all, we were both so exhausted that I fell asleep in her bed. And in the morning she asked with an angelic face: "Why did you sleep in my bed, mommy?" "Very early, in front of the house, Hippolene greeted the morning. Today is a big day. The endless tree is still sleeping. There is no beginning or end. At the end of a branch there is always another branch and leaves, lots of leaves. Farther than very far away, the leaves are blue, almost invisible. It's called heaven. Grandma told her so. Grandma knows everything. I don't know what I'm going to do alone in this apartment. - Do you want to move? - Close to work. And practically. Practically? You can go for a walk with your dog. If you have it. You will meet someone. A guy with a Dalmatian. Mom? Yes? have you met someone? No kidding. Did you meet... I met. It's great. - Do you really think so? - Of course. I thought you'd take it worse. Why? On the contrary. long already? Not. Who is this? I know him? - Is that Mr. Goldstein? - Cecilia! - Did you meet him at the gym? - Not! Sorry, I'm curious. A new partner is not just anything. Is he good to you? Will you introduce him to me? Sorry. No rush. Do not rush. Well well... Well well... - Have a nice day, Mr Escande. - "Have a nice day". - Bye honey. - "Bye honey". I love you. I love you too. his backpack. marcel! - Are you okay? - All right? Yes. - For sure? - Yes. Be careful or I'll have to deal with it. hold. I saw her picture. Beautiful woman. Who? Doctor Sissoko. Are you going to the ministry as well? Yes. Will you meet her again? Yes. But it's not her. Not? So who? - You didn't want to know. - I want now. I know her? Shauna. Shauna Loszinsky. Georges friend? She's an old lady. I am 70 years old. No time for jokes. I am not joking. I farted... This is not funny. And yet. Sorry. - Do not apologize. - You're right! What am I apologizing for? How are you? Come on, I'll buy you a coffee. No thanks. Listen... I don't want to listen to you. We can't spend all day like this. I took you to her! - What a fool I am. - It's not your fault. It happens. I really don't know how this can happen. Have you slept with her? I do not believe. Shauna is like a mother to me! Why did you do this to me? Will you meet her again? Today? are you kidding me? And your children? - Please... - And your wife? Jeanne may seem brave, but she's still vulnerable. I spend all day with her. - This is my wife. - It's not about you. - Wait... I introduced you, I was your witness! You also introduced me to my mistress. - What would I do without you? - I'm wondering too! In this knot - you have no family, so you meddle in my affairs! What are you looking for with girls half your age? Great! Now I'm the problem! Go screw up your life, I don't care! Sorry. Good day. Something happened? The meeting at the ministry failed. Cholera... Tell me about it. coffee? Yes please. What happened? Does not matter. Everything's all right? - I'm sorry, buddy. - Do not worry. Yes, Patrick. Mr. Durieux has bone metastases. Can it move? No neurological problems with the legs? I can't come now. Sorry. Do not apologize. Work is important. I used to work too. I was overwhelmed and restless. I didn't sleep before the competitions. I know how it is. Do you know what I did today besides doing crossword puzzles? I cleaned, went to the hairdresser, put on makeup, bought a bouquet of tulips. For half an hour I couldn't choose between freesias and roses because... I didn't know what you like... Because... I thought... Don't ruin your life for a woman with no future. It does not make sense. I have a lot to do. Too late! Look at me. Can't you see that everything has changed? Thanks to you. What do you see in a seventy-year-old? You think you can kill someone with tulips? I want you. Ah, it's you. Mom is sleeping? No, she's not back yet. And Marcel? I gave him food and put him down. Thanks. You're welcome. He asked if you were called in for another lockdown. Really sorry. Do you want a beer? do you have school tomorrow I actually do. All right? - Cool. - As much? I caught something. What? Papillomavirus. Dangerous. Are you not protecting yourself? I use masks, gloves and gums. It's cool if I get cancer, my father is an oncologist. Don't talk nonsense. It can be removed with a laser. I know, I already made an appointment. - Mom knows? - What for? You have a boyfriend? I have two hundred and none at all. Meaning? I do not have a boyfriend. You did not notice? I didn't mean to be nosy. You don't really want to be nosy... It's hard to find a golden mean. Because it doesn't exist! The world sucks and I'll never fall in love. It will happen again. When will I be 70? Jeanne told you? Cholera... you're back. I met a cold Pakistani man and I didn't have change. No vase here? He wouldn't take the bill, though I insisted. He gave me all the roses. I didn't want them. Anyway he would take the refusal as an insult. That doesn't mean he was begging. Leave! It's a real mafia. What will he have left with those 20 euros? Five euros for an all night job? What a shit! - Jeanne... - Don't touch me! - Will you leave us? - Better yes. No, stay. I'll go sleep elsewhere. Mom, stop! You're hurting him! Calm down! Do not touch me! Not! Have a nice day, honey. Leave. You can't pack properly. You'll forget your socks. Let me pack you up. It'll do me good. - Did you lose something? - A cell phone. Wait, I'll call you. Is there. You're lucky I'm alone. I'm sorry, George. Come in. Come on! What do you think? They play well. Really. Shauna likes rugby? Jeanne was right. It's great to be with an older woman and not care what other people think. - I don't have the courage. - Did she say that? It's easier to impress a young beauty with a degree in medicine. And I don't work in the emergency room. The train from Lyon arrives at platform G. "Don't let me stop thinking and began to blindly, timidly agree! I want to celebrate every day, not be afraid to experience pain and not lock yourself in insensitive stupor. I don't want to avoid doubts and criticism in life or take the easy way out. Learn and think, think and live live and learn - always with a new look, new understanding, new love. Beautiful. She killed herself when she was 31. But first she prepared the children breakfast. Mathilde talked about you. Yes? That you're one of those extravagant people who tiptoes through life. I was looking for you at the hospital. I decided to give you a photo. I wanted to, though I don't know why. Maybe I already loved you then. Cholera! Shopping. I'll take care of it. Hunk. Attention. I can handle it. Yes... Cholera! Moron! Sorry. Mr Zhang is in love with you? I made you an omelette on the floor. But I saved one egg. One can do a lot. For example - do you like pancakes? The water is terribly hot. I'll be all wrinkled. When you went to the door, I became a petite old woman. Mrs Parkinson's latency period is over. I will increase the dose of dopamine to avoid further symptoms and limit their effects. What are the symptoms? Weakened motor skills can cause tremors, movement disorders and, paradoxically, difficulty in moving. You may have to think about every activity - walking, about speaking before expressing your thoughts... Tying shoelaces seems impossible. What else? Episodes of being lost... And in the long run - loss of facial expressions and stiffening, something like a mask. You have to take dopamine every three hours. This will require self-discipline. I will also prescribe antidepressants. How did your young agency gain access to public contracts? Thanks to open tenders. Our first project was a kindergarten near Paris. We didn't like forcing the kids to sit in class when a drop of rain fell. We even wanted outdoor activities sometimes. That is why we designed a roof over the playground. Excuse me, did you ladies decide to participate in the tender, because it was kindergarten? Please sit down. What did you ask? Maybe two women had a better chance of winning the tender for the kindergarten. I am an architect, and not just a woman. Can you direct the construction like a kindergarten project? Difficult question. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - Don't apologize. I've become a mean old woman. Thank you. I arrived on an earlier train out of curiosity. The ones on the left. - Left hand? - On the left. Ah, the door. - What will we eat? - I was learning. Vartilab is working on a new Parkinson's therapy. I can't see the menu. - Take your order? - Special of the day. Okay. and you? Tatar. Prepared or not? - As you prefer. - I won't eat. Please prepare. Raw or lightly fried? You know what? I'll have steak and fries. And a carafe of cold tap water. Perfect, thank you. Let's end this, Pierre. Go to the station, you'll catch the train. What happened? You're tired? Do you want to be alone? Not. I want us to stop seeing each other. Why? - I wanted to believe it... - Come on, it's okay. Look, at my age, it doesn't really matter. I get bored easily. me? - Am I boring you? - Yes. Even you. Sometimes. Sorry. - We need to talk! - I'm tired. I know what you feel. That you're afraid. But I'm not afraid. Trust me. I don't need your concern. I love you! It has nothing to do with caring. There's something wrong with your head. You fell in love with a sick old woman. You're not serious. I have to go home. let me through. Do not break it. You don't have to protect me. I was fine without you. I had peace without your hands and this damned love! Leave me alone! Go away! I'm not moving from here. Leave me alone! I do not want to see you again! It's not true. Not true. You will finish me! I love you, Pierre. And if you love me too go away. I beg. Mom? You don't even want... warm milk? Why didn't you say it was him? I was afraid you'd be sorry. Do I look that desperate? Of course not. You underestimate how much I love you. Anyway know that your Pierre is not my type at all! I like older. You should know about it. Mom... I will call you. All right? I've been worse. And better. And you? I'm holding on. I'm sorry, Rosalie. - It's not your fault. - Not for that. For all the rest. For my absence... "Evil enough." According to Winnicott, "a good enough mother" is bad enough to give the child space to develop his adult personality. Have you read Winnicott? By chance. So was I bad enough? What? Miss Escande? Mom, come in with me. Okay. Did you want to talk? I wanted to say... A bathtub with a door should be installed, so she doesn't have to climb. And with a seat inside to make it easier for her to take a shower. She felt fine. Meeting you sped it up. It was worth it? Do you really think it was worth it? Sorry. I have to go. I did not want. 3 MONTHS LATER It's in bad shape. It looks terrible. I do not know... Maybe it's maternal concern. I tell myself that he still needs me. - Nice weather at your place? - Yes. I can take a weekend off. Come? I have a lot of vacation but I miss my daughter, boyfriend, assassinations and viruses. No restrictions. Exactly. I miss this. I miss you. is that you? I'll leave it here in case anyone is looking. Mom? Room 402, Martha Flores. He weighs 41 kilos and is 164 cm tall. She is very weak. The tumor has grown an inch. A recent examination showed three mediastinal tumors ranging in size from one and a half centimeters to two. Have other patients developed the disease at this stage? 5 out of 7 patients had a complete or partial regression. So the results are rather positive. Overall - yes. It was worth a try. I'm sorry to disturb you. I'm trying to call your mother but I can't find her number on my phone. I probably wrote something wrong. Will you give it to me? But... Mom is long gone. Where? Shauna... Mathilde died 15 years ago. Sorry. I'm all wrong. I was a little... Don't worry. Good night. Mom, I did a kickflip! - Making progress. - Yes... He fell 20 times and got back on the board 20 times. Bold. You're beautiful. Thank you. I'll go now. Do you want to stay for dinner? Not... I have a lot of paperwork. Everything's all right? Yes, it's great. Kaushik and I broke up. It was just teenage love. Children's love... Youthful. children's. You haven't even had your period. You said so yourself. Does Parkinson's Lose Memory? Something's wrong with you. Thanks. It's me, thank you. Glad you came. Mom would like me to be here. What about her? It's just a crack. She will be walking again soon. They watch her therapy. You can live with Parkinson's for many years. And your mom is not weak. Don't worry. I would be worried? As a child, you took care of lost cats and birds that fell out of the nest. Someone had to deal with the ones you slingshot at. I did it to make you feel needed. Really? If you need anything... For example, a number? Looks like you still have nice tits. And you may have made progress... I don't think so. In that case... Does Pierre know about Shauna? Not. Say something. - Does Mrs. Loszinsky live here? - Yes. Here she is. Good day. who are you? Jeanne Escande. - I'm sorry... - Please wait. Thank you, Kenzo. What are you doing here? I came out of curiosity. How is he? Badly. He actually quit his job. I'm worried about him. He doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep. I pretty much dropped everything too. Please sit down. Do you feel disgust for me? At your age, I suppose if my husband cheated on me with an old woman, I'd be disgusted. In fact, my husband was cheating on me with younger men, so... Anyway it hurts like hell, doesn't it? Pierre, ma'am, did you say we lost the baby? After he died, I didn't leave my room for a year. I slept on a mattress by the bed, with closed shutters. I didn't think I would survive. Rosalie was four years old. Pierre avoided mourning for her sake. He took care of us despite your sadness. Throughout all these years he was alert. He pushed forward. And then... met you. I came to tell you that he needs you. Goodbye. Good day. So? How are you? As you can see... And you, Shauna? Pierre, listen. You must live on. I can't. - You have to. - But I can not. I'll end up in a wheelchair. I know. I will really die. I know. But we still breathe the same air. So let's make the best of it. Okay.
