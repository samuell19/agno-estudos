Translation: neet21 [these subtitles may contain inaccuracies and grammar mistakes] (Inamura Taxi) Oh, here we are, huh? What is it? It's raining cats and dogs. I'm sick of this. I'm dying of thirst. Fucking hell! Get me some wine! Today is May 23rd, 2004. I'm passing through the lounge from the courtyard. And moving to the office. What? My brother's turning the screws. Is he gonna get stabbed by that screwdriver? What? My sister's cutting the doll's hair. Is she gonna get cut with those scissors? Yuji, don't scare me with that. You can write a novel as you please. But don't write about your family. It's okay to write about our family. It's all just about us getting beaten up. It's okay to use it as a material. I'm back. Welcome back. I made some rice balls. Daiki. Daiki ... Sonoko, too, have some. Everyone, listen up. I want to talk to you guys. What do you want to talk about? Well ... I just ... I just killed your dad. I ran him over with a car. And it killed him. What? But it's actually wrong to do. That's why ... I waited until grandma and grandpa were dead. No one would feel sorry for him. Wait, mom ... Your dad scarred the hell out of you every day. So, I killed him. I'm going to the police right now. You guys keep going to school, live your lives. And this company ... Uncle Marui will take care of it, so don't worry. I don't know how long I'll be in jail. I don't think I would be able to come back. Even if I had released I would have to wait until everyone's forgotten about it. It will be 10 years? No, I think more than that. 15 years. 15 years later ... I'll be back. Koharu ... I should be leaving now. No one will ever lay a finger on you again. So, you guys can live your lives the way you want. Live your lives freely. Be whatever you want to be. So, right now ... I'm so proud of myself. Yuji! Yuji, what are you doing? Go after her. She said she will be back. She lied, she won't come back. Mom never tells a lie. Then, just stand here and wait! ONE NIGHT I ... I quit my job at the hostess club to be a door-to-door girl. How about you? Why did you want to be a journalist? When I was in middle school I stole a porn magazine and felt bad about it. Stole a porn magazine. It's hilarious. So, I thought I'd pay back the publisher as a penance. It's atonement. What do you mean? Okay, let me ask you something. What's your special skill? Power vacuum blowjob. (Sonoko is calling) What about sensitive areas? (Sonoko is calling) Breast. Sonoko. Good morning. - Hi! - Thanks for the ride. Do you want to go shopping with me? Yes. You're still in touch with that guy? I called my brother. I already broke up with that guy. That's good. You're really bad at picking men. But you did say your boyfriend was thoughtful. Then, he shouldn't have ever punched you in the face. But he always does it like this. And then you do it like this. And he punches you in the stomach. He's great. He's really great, even though we're not in touch. He's not very thoughtful, is he? What would you like to buy? (Fukuchan Electric) - It's time to unload. - Okay. Good work, everyone. Good work. I can't reach the new guy. I'll go ... I'll go with you guys tomorrow. Eh? Manager goes to the site? - What is it? - It's okay. It's enough to only have us. Okay. (Inamaru Taxi) (Friendly and Safe Inamaru Taxi) Yes, Inamaru Taxi. Thank you for reaching us. Yes, in front of the Hanamasa? Just a moment, I'll confirm it. - Mr. Hakuta. - Yes. Can you go to Hanamasa? - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay. Okay. - Thanks, I'll leave it to you. - I'm off. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's your registration card. Check it out. Here. Take it. When you go to work, take a roll call first. Like this. Put in the tube and blow for three seconds. - It's the rules. - Understand. - Good job. - Good job. Ah, let me introduce him to you. This is Mr. Doushita Michio, who officially started working today. She's Ushiku, everyone calls her Moo. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Can you go to Mr. Sakurai in Kamiyama-Cho now? - Copy that. I'm leaving in 10 minutes. - Okay. Well, basically there's nothing difficult about this job. The only trouble is picking up the boss's daughter. Boss's daughter? So it's ... No, she is not my daughter, she is the ex-boss's daughter. The ex-boss here was my dad's brother-in-law. I have taken over Inamura Taxi. - You'll be very helpful. - Give me plenty of advice! I can't reach Yuji at all. Yuji ... he's a journalist. He must have been so busy. Why are we the only ones who have to clean this man's grave? (The Inamura Family's Tomb) If you're dead ... It means you're already dead! Someone's looking at you. Forget it. Mom's already served her time anyway. It's exactly 15 years today. What do you mean, “exactly”? I'm hungry. It's enough, isn't it? You're good. You're such a good son, brother! (Inamura Yuji's Thousand Hammers) Inamura. Can you transcribe this? Transcribe? We're short-handed. My previous proposal. How did it go? Proposal? Let me tell you something. If you want to climb up, that's fine with me. But you need to get the job done well first. Is this smart-alecky article for your own pleasure? “The 53 trips to the Red Light District”? You're writing erotic novels, you know. Figure out what people want. Rewrite it. - I want to ask you something. - Yes? Have you ever heard of a girl named Milk at that bar? Ah, I think I have ever heard of her. She's a Filipino girl? Yes. I think I've got a crush on her. Ah, why did I say that? I hate it. Not at all. It was so dark yesterday— Shit! Moo! What's going on? Huh? Wait a minute, what? - You worked hard today. - Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work. - You are welcome. Mr. Doushita. It's been a hard first day. How about have some drink? No, I can't drink. I'm a terrible drinker. He doesn't smoke, drink, or gamble. I just see that he's honest and hardworking. I accepted him on the spot because of that. - I'll drink with you, then. - Sure, let's drink together. - I'm back. - Thanks for your hard work. I'm miserable. What's wrong? I almost hit someone. Something swooshed through the darkness. Huh? A civet? No, it's a hiker. Taking a shortcut down the mountain. Heavily armed. Are you okay? You didn't get injured, did you? I thought I was going to die. At this late? You should wait until dawn to go down. Hello, Inamaru Taxi. Oh, I see. It must be Sonoko, right? - Boss's daughter. - Mama, I'm sorry. She drunk heavily today. I'm not going there. I see. Why don't you let me go to pick her up? I see, your name's Doushita. You're handsome, but your hair ... Let me give you a quick tip. Your hair should look like this. I have cut it out for you! Thank you so much. What is it? You sound upset. You don't like it. Let me tell you something. I've done it for all the drivers. I'm a rising star in the hairdressing world. I'm brilliant. Turn right there. No, no! You can't throw up over there. - Are you okay? - It was a close call. No, you didn't make it. Can you walk? You okay? I'm sorry. - I'm gonna throw up. - More puke? Then hurry. “No one will ever lay a finger on you again.” “So, you guys can live your lives the way you want.” “Live your lives freely.” “Be whatever you want to be.” “So, right now ... I'm so proud of myself.” Those were mom's last words to us. I still remember it. Who? Don't ask me. Excuse me … Who are you? Daiki? I don't know what to say, so ... Sonoko. Daiki. What are you doing? Now what? Sonoko. Let's just ... open the door first. Okay? I gave you my word. I made a promise. That's why I came back. What's with that outfit? You look alike a mountain girl. She looks young, doesn't she? How are you guys doing? Don't do this. Mom. I'm back. I'm back. I'm finally back. (How long will the central government remain incompetent?) (The Japanese are the worst businessmen in the world) (Brother is calling) Hello? Yuji, where are you now? Why are you asking me where I am now? She is back. She is back. Can you come back home tomorrow? It's exactly 15 years today. Mom kept her promise一 (A loving mother was a murderer) Are you really back? I've also worked in a cafeteria in Okinawa. As a dairy farmer and hotel clerk in Hokkaido. I went to a dumpling restaurant in Utsunomiya. Anyway, since I got my life back, I had no place to stay. “I got my life back?” I wish I could say that, too. Don't say a stupid thing. Anyway, Koharu. Allow me to welcome you back once again. Welcome back. Welcome back. Thank you. You're surprised, aren't you? You didn't think Yuji's childhood friend would work here. I was like ... “I want to drive a taxi!” Right? That's what I said. You've all made a name for yourselves. And this dealership is in good hands thanks to you guys. What are you talking about? They're having a good time. - What to do? - What? What should we do? How would I know? Let's wait for Yuji to come back. I still can't believe it. She's really back. She's really back. At that time ... we waited and waited. We have accepted it already. Then, we got used to her being gone. Yeah. Are you angry? Why? Huh? You're married? Yeah, but he is dead. It's been 10 years since he's dead. Right? It's been so long. I didn't know you were married. - You really didn't know? - I didn't know. - You're so ... - She really didn't know? Huh? What's going on? - Yuji? - Yuji? What the hell? What are you doing here, Yuji? Who are you hitching a ride with? Whose car did you take? How come you didn't hitch a ride with us? Just call us and we'll pick you up. Yuji's back, too. You want some meat? Ah, no. No? Auntie's back. The prodigal son is back, too. Who's a prodigal son? You're back. I'm back. Welcome back. I'm back. It feels like you've changed a bit. Huh? Hi. Long time no see. How are you? At least you should have kept in touch with us. Yeah. How long will you stay? I don't know. I fixed up the guest room on the first floor for you. There's my daughter's luggage in there. But only a few stuff. Wow, nothing's changed. - What the fuck are you doing? Hey! - Stop it! - Asshole! you need a beating. - Stop it. Come over here and I'll teach you a lesson. - Come the fuck with me! - Dad, stop it! You asshole. You're not even listening to me! Stop it! How many times do I have to tell you the same thing! Fuck you, asshole! Stop it! Shut the fuck up! Fuck you, son of a bitch! Don't you dare run away from me! Shameful! Wait a minute. Stop it! Yuji! Stop it! Bastard! How dare you order your dad around! Get up, get up, get up, get up! Stop it! Stop it! Can you shut the fuck up? Get out of here! Why don't you understand? Let me give you a lesson. -You deserve a beating. - Stop it. Please stop it! Does it work? Stop it! It takes up too much space. Ah, sorry. Have a seat. Daiki. Let's have breakfast. Yuji, come here, too. Is this a good timing for everyone? Yes. What is it? It took me a long time ... but I finally came back. That time, I thought I shouldn't come back. I didn't want to see you guys anymore. But I was actually一 We're all happy, that's enough, isn't it? Before I came back Susumu helped me keep the dealership in good order. “Ina” of Inamura and “Maru” of Marui are united became “Inamaru Taxi” He said ... we're one family. Please listen. I feel numb. - Here you go. - Thank you, it's Yuji's. I heard it from Uta yesterday that Yuji's article was in a magazine. You're a big journalist now. Thanks to you, because of that case I couldn't stay here any longer. So, I decided to work in Tokyo. I'm starting. I see. I'm going to hang out the quilts. Ah, okay. Don't talk nonsense. Give me the soy sauce. Good morning, dad. Miyo, you're going to kindergarten? Morning. I had been trying to talk to you about it, and you haven't given a response. So, I'd like you to decide here. Decide what? Miyo, who do you want to stay with, mom or dad? It's not a done deal. Don't ask her that. Miyo, you want to stay with mom, don't you? Yes. I'll send the divorce papers to you later. You can leave Miyo's luggage here. Let's go. I'm not getting a divorce. I will never. What the fuck! Oh, shit. (The Inamura Family's Tomb) (Yuichi, 41 years old) Dangerous! I didn't see you. I almost did it again. Why are you driving? Everyone's working so hard, I thought I'd help out. I'm leaving now. Huh? Huh? What was that? What did you just “huh” about? It's nothing. You know, I think ... Mr. Doushita seems like a nice guy. It's pretty rare. You're attracted to a serious guy like him. I might even want him to hug me. No way. He's an honest guy, don't play with him. What should I do? What di you mean, “What should I do?” Look ahead. It's dangerous. What's wrong, Yuji? I haven't seen you like this in a long time. I almost got run over by mom. Huh? But, she was driving as nothing happened. She was trying to kill me, too, right? Don't say “kill” all the time. Mom was doing that to save us. The ramp that stretches under dry skies Your back is fading The tender words are still missing Did you guys make a mistake coming here? It's a date, right? A date? Not really. Not really. - Right? - What? - There she is. - What's up? Go away, it's disgusting. Why don't you two sing a song? I don't sing, leave me alone. What's wrong with you? Does she do that a lot? She's been drunk every day lately. And yesterday she threw up in the taxi. Does she get too much pressure? - Mama! - Coming. Don't give up on your dream My wife is a year older than me. What? I'm married. And I have a daughter. I see. So, that's it. That's reasonable. I'm 31 years old now. I hate it. My time stopped when you were 16. Huh? What about your wife? We're living apart for a while. You guys don't get along? It happens all the time. Anything can happen between a couple. No, it doesn't. It just... just for now. Yuji, it hurts. Hang on a second. What's going on? It's okay now. Yuji. What? Let me borrow this towel. Use as you please. Have you three siblings ever talked? What to talk about? What do you mean, “What to talk about”? You were so scary. I haven't done it for so long. I've turned into a beast. No, it felt like ... you were just taking your anger out on me. - Thank you for the ride. - No problem. I'll be waiting for you. I'm off then. Bye, Sonoko. - Good night! - Bye! Drive safe. I drunk too much. What are you doing? (The murderer who's never reported on TV) Where did you go? Eh? Does this house have a curfew? Who the hell did this? (Murderer! Get lost!) (Witch) (Is it good or evil to kill someone like that?) (Murderer) I think ... it's better not to tell mom about this. I feel sorry for her. She won't be able to stay. Yeah, I think so. It's all old news. What are you guys so serious about? What are you doing? I wanted to film it and show it to her. And tell her, “It's your fault these things keep happening.” Stop it, Yuji. I'm just kidding. Here are 100,000 yen in advance. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Please sign the IOU. Pardon me. Okay, I'll call it a day then. Boss, you want to start drinking now? I'm a man who lives for beer. You work early every day, don't you? 100,000 yen. Are you spending it on women? Oh, no, you're mistaken. Then, I'll make myself at home. Here you go. Thanks for coming. Let the owls return to the forest in Ibaraki. Please help us with a donation. Please help us with a donation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are you Kazuki? I ... I'm your dad. I know. I haven't seen you in a long time. You've grown up. Now you're talking like a man. Dad. Can you drink? I quit. That stuff is bad for you. You've been taking care of your health. How about ordering some food to eat? No, no, it's enough for a man to eat only meat. Dad, your back's not straight. Okay, Kazuki, watch my next shot. If it's a home run, we'll just ... You're too late. Fuck off! Dad, dad, watch this. (Homerun) That's great! Home run, home run. Congratulations on the home run. - Amazing. - Awesome. You go ahead. Say hello to your mom for me. Don't mention it. You and I will always be dad and son. Dad, thank you. See you again. See you again. I was so happy to see you today. Driver, please send him home safely. Okay, no problem. Thank you very much. Yes. Yumi, have a drink with me. Sorry, my mother-in-law's missing again. Does she start having dementia? I've been walking around to find her every night. I wish she was dead. But I'm afraid of being gossiped about. So, I had to rush home to find her at times like this. I keep thinking I wish I had your guts. Guts? I really don't think it's your fault. Because you were trying to protect your kids from your crazy husband. I had no guts at all. I'm sorry. I had no guts at all. So … what was it, then? All right, I'm off. I'll drink with you later. Okay, good work. Good work. (The day I really hated matcha bean ice the most) Mom, are you still awake? Is it you, Sonoko? Come on in. You can't sleep? Can I sleep with you? Sorry, I will disturb you. Sonoko, let me ask you something. There's a photo in the photo album that says ... “The day I really hated matcha bean ice the most” What's that? It was near the prison. The day you were released from prison Yumi and I went to prison. We came to see you. But we didn't know when you're coming out. And it was a hot day. So, we went to a nearby cafe for shaved ice. But I didn't realize you were out around that time. I thought I'd never see you again. Isn't mom back now? Thanks for the ride. I'll open the door. Thank you. Is Daiki here? Hello. Are you ... Daiki's wife? Yes. Nice to meet you. I'm Daiki's mother. What? Daiki, that woman won't come back until you show up your face. This isn't the right timing, I'll talk to her later. Please! Isn't that enough? Just get a divorce already. Listen up, Yuji. It's not so bad if you live here forever. But you're not here much. You mean I'm running away? You are, so you have no say. You two should stop arguing. You're the best at doing justice and have been doing it ever since. What's wrong with you? Is it to show that you are the most objective and cool? But if you look at it from a distance you'd think this family was weird. Are you kidding? You're part of the family, too! Stop it, asshole! I see. So, he didn't mention me to you. Yeah, he said his parents died when he was a kid. He's been lying to me ever since, right? Where is your daughter? She's at my parents' house today. Her name is Miyo, isn't it? I'd love to meet her. I'm a lousy mother, though. But she's my eldest granddaughter. Well, I don't think ... I don't think you'll ever see her again. Why? I came to hear what you want to say. That's enough. I'm tired of you, you have been lying to me all the time. I've done everything for you but you still don't trust me at all! Because ... I didn't know how to tell you. Sign here. I'm going home. Fumiko. Fumiko. - Stop the car! - Fumiko! - Open up! -Wait a minute. - Don't touch me! Get away from me! - Listen up. Fumiko. Open the window. Open the window, so you can hit me like that time again? No, that's ... Go to Fukuchan Electric in Ishioka. We can't talk like this. - Hurry up, drive! - Yes. Listen up. Koharu, what are you doing? It's Daiki's mother. Can you hear me? Fumiko, can you hear me? I would like to ... I would like to talk with you. Over. Is it abnormal for me to be like this? Over. It's not abnormal at all. I'll let Daiki do the talking. Over. Daiki. It's me. You tell me, go ahead. You ... go to the office every day but you don't even come to my place. You have no intention of living with me at all. Don't judge for yourself, okay? I know. You didn't marry me because you love me. You just want my shop and my kids, right? How is that possible? Then why didn't you tell me something so important? Did you think you don't have to discuss it with me? Over. Over. Let's take the boat out to find the turtles - You like fishing and golfing? - Yes. It's time to go to the turtles一 (15 years later) (The Inamura Taxi Murder Case in May 2004 15 years of nothing, the whole family has driven mad by a loving mother) (She came back to her kids. The eldest son who has a chronic disease gave up his dreams to live a rotten life) (And the daughter who gave up her dream as a hairdresser) (Malicious harassment is rampant) (Trying to justify the crime) (The family in name only) (A loving mother was a murderer) You know the Chinese are buying up land in Hokkaido, don't you? I'll take the ferry from there to Tomakomai, then to Ibaraki-Oarai. Taxi drivers seem to call some of them, monsters. You know the ones who travel long trips. Please drive. From now on ... I'll use a courier named Hazuki. And I will call your place and get him a cab. Just assume a monster would appear once a month. From here to Tokyo. You want me to deliver it for you? That's pretty arrogant! It's a business deal. I'll do you a favor just for once. I'm out of this business. Don't let me see you again. What should I do? So, it's all over in one go? What are you hiding? You used to kick me in the back like this. I used to admire you for that. You were the one in the back seat. Ah, Yumi. What? What's going on? (Grandma hasn't come back yet What should we do?) It's from my daughter. She said her grandmother has disappeared again. You're kidding, right? We have to find her. Forget it. Forget it. Come on, let's make it to the climax. Yumi. I want to have some time to myself, too. I'm sick of it. - Yumi! - I hate this. Yumi, let's go find grandma. No, I don't want to. I don't want to! Please, I don't want to. Please. I'm slipping in again. Welcome. Why did you call me here? There are some things we can't talk about at home. The stuff on your computer. I saw it. The article, “A loving mother was a murderer.” You wrote that, didn't you? That's not true, is it? Yuji. When was that article published? I was in junior high at that time. That's true. Sonoko, so it's not him. That story was far from the truth. So, I rewrote for another one. I changed the title, “A loving mother was a murderer.” See? I knew it. Using the family's despised past as fodder. It's suffocating. And it says, “To be continued”! How far are you willing to go? So what? What's wrong with making money off the thing that has been caused me through so much trouble. She is our mother. She is our mother. She is your mother. He doesn't think she's his mother. She's just a woman who committed a murder. It's just fodder for his article. - Hey, they are from Inamaru Taxi. - I know. The one who killed her husband. I heard their mother is back. What the fuck are you talking about? Sonoko! She's our mother after all. But she killed someone. It's none of my business what other people think of her. Don't go too far! She left her kids and went without considering the consequences. You think she has washed her hands of all her sins. Don't be ridiculous. Yuji, no. So, I'm the only bad guy here? That's enough! Go outside and argue! Sorry for the trouble. I'm so sorry. She is still our mother, isn't she? Brother ... you're talking so well when you're drunk. Let's talk about something else. Daiki. Forget it. - I said forget it. - No. She's still our mother. I'm going to write it anyway. And use it as a springboard to become a novelist. What are you doing here so late? What about you? Just hang around. You just grabbed a random magazine, didn't you? That reminds me of something. Reminds you of what? That's it. You stole a porn magazine from the convenience store in front of the station. A porn magazine? But you didn't see me steal it, did you? It was on your birthday and when you were a freshman. Take it out. Gorgeous Beauty, October issue. Theft is ... the retail industry's natural enemy. I have to call the police. We'll have to ask them to give him a lesson. I'll take care of it, so don't call the police. No, no! It will spoil him and he'll keep doing it again. Then, it's not stealing. What? I asked him to buy it, but I forgot to give him the money. I ... I haven't had sex in a long time. I'm going to explode if I don't read that magazine. Stop looking at it. I said stop looking at it. It's embarrassing. You really like reading books and magazines. That's not the same thing as this, is it? Your dad's always talking about making you a taxi driver. But everyone has to live the life they want. What's this? I thought note and pen were better. But everyone says everything's going to be computer-based. Don't ever tell your dad about it, okay? Wow! I would like to have some iced tea, too. Okay. How busy are you as a journalist? Stop talking about me. Why don't you talk about Daiki and Sonoko. That's true, but I always thought ... that Daiki would work at a computer company. How could he ever get a decent job? Why not? “Why not?” you say? But Daiki has a good head on his shoulders. Daiki ... If he hadn't met Fumiko in his workplace I don't know what he'd be like now. He would be treated like a fool everywhere. He can't even cure his stammer. Sonoko, too. She was called “a murderer's kid” and ostracized. And dropped out of hairdressing school. What do you think ... about these things? How does it feel to be called a loving mother? When your kids' lives got messed up what did you do? I ... Guarding us from afar? It was easier while dad's alive as long as we could get through his violence. But after you killed him everything's lost its way. I didn't do anything wrong. There's nothing wrong with what I did. So ... why did you come back? (Inamura Yuji's Thousand Hammers) Good morning. You're early today. Today's issue is Yuji's article. I went to buy it this morning. Is Yuji's article in it? Yeah. Expectation value and cumulative distribution function ... those are difficult to understand. There's no cure for being a parent. Parents will laugh and cry because of their kids. I also have a 17-year-old son by my ex-wife. And he wanted to meet me one day out of the blue. He said he had something to discuss with me. But he just wanted money. He spent it on video games, comics and other boring stuff. So, that's what happened. I was so happy ... that night. We were just ... eating, having some fun, and then went home. But it just feels like something hasn't changed. I don't know if I should say this. But I think you're great. You committed a crime for the sake of your kids. Believe in yourself, without a doubt. I'd like to be as strong as you, too. But it's not like that. Now ... I start to doubt what I've done. But if I apologize my kids will lose their way. I'll pick it up. You have to get ready for work, don't you? Pardon me. Hello, it's Inamaru Taxi. Koharu? Yumi? Koharu ... I let it happen. I killed my mother-in-law. The casket is departing. The mourners please move to the hearse. Is Yumi all right? She always thought she was responsible. She and her daughter had been out on the streets all night looking for her mother-in-law. So, I told her it wasn't her fault. - It's totally different. - I see. It's cheaper? I want to have it. Yes, please. - It'll be stamped first. - Really? - What's your name, please? - Yamada. Excuse me. Manager. Why did you hide it? Even if I told it to you ... it would not change anything. I told you. You're not the only one who makes the decisions. It's so important, and I just found out about it now. What do you think I should do? I'm not the only one in trouble, Miyo will be too. What will people say about her when she gets older? Miyo. What would people say about her? What about you? What would they say about her? “She's the granddaughter of a murderer?” That's right. You didn't tell me anything! You mean you won't marry me if I say so? And you ... And you won't have kids with me? If that's the case, I will spill it. Wait a minute. What? What happened? You're back. What? What? What? What? What's going on here? It looks like the tires are all punctured. Punctured? Here we go again. - I never told you about this. - Don't. We had been harassed since you left. And recently it's happened again. Ah, it hurts. Did I cause this? No, you didn't. You didn't anything wrong, Auntie. It hurts. What's wrong is the trash that's harassing us. It's all Yuji's fault. Yuji wrote this article. What? Yuji. What's wrong? Daiki? Hey, wait a minute. You wait here. What's going on? You guys arguing again? No. I ... I know about that case. I'll sign it now. You wait here. Wait a minute. Hey! Wait a minute. Daiki. Daiki? What did Fumiko do? She said Miyo is the murderer's granddaughter. I didn't say that. I said you had to think about what people might say. Stop bullshitting. I'm not blaming that case on anything. It's about Miyo. I'm just thinking of changing her name. It's something we should sit down and talk about. Daiki! Are you okay? Fumiko ... You'd better go home, first. Daiki! Daiki! Calm down. We can talk about it another time. Fumiko, I'm sorry, you go home first. Sorry. Don't ever set foot in here again! It's Inamura family's problem. If you have any problems it will be mine and Miyo's too. I'm your family, too. So ... please take a good look at us too. Daiki, do you have any idea what you've just done? How could you do such a thing? You're no different ... “You're no different than your dad?” Yeah! So what? If I were just like dad, so you were going ... to kill me? Daiki! Mom, you're so great. You want to kill a useless man like me, don't you? Anyway, you're always doing good. We're all going down the wrong path. Daiki. Mom! Mom ... Ignore her. She's in no position to talk about Daiki's family. Why? Why are you all blaming mom? She saved us from that man. And then what? What have we become? And you ended up hating her, too. You're wrong. You guys, that's enough! Get out of the way! Damn it. Who did all this dirty work? It's useless to think about such things. It didn't work. I'm so unhappy. The tires are coming. Thanks. What's wrong with boss? Why is he crying? I don't know. Boss, why are you crying? Because of the tires? It's not just the tires. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year all I could think about was the taxis. But I actually wanted to be a fisherman. Ah, it's the same old story. Wait up. Thank you. - Why did I have to work so hard? - Just a minute. Hello, it's Inamaru Taxi. I'm really sorry. Yeah, I'll be right there. Look at that. There's no excuse for stealing with such a big thorn in your side what else do you want to say? Gorgeous Beauty. (Reprint edition) There she is. Mom, what have you done? Can't you see with your eyes? I'm really sorry. I hope you don't call the police. Mom. Why? It's nothing. There's no why at all. My son is in the middle of a divorce. I'm causing all the harassment at the dealership. And today is the funeral of Yumi's mother-in-law. But I stole a porn magazine. At such an important moment I stole a porn magazine. I had been away from home for 15 years without caring about my kids' pain. Daiki! Am I a great mother? I'm a great mother, aren't I? Dragging a bunch of people into this. And that's all you're gonna say. You deserve to be dragged. Whether she's wrong or pointless, you deserve to be dragged. It's the only way she could express herself. It's not like you don't know it! Sorry. I would like to have one. That magazine was Gorgeous Beauty. Gorgeous Beauty. I thought of that, too. It's the same one Yuji stole before. - Reprint edition. - Reprint. The timing was just too coincidental. What the hell with that reprint edition shit? We all laughing. But it's not funny at all. Yuji. I don't hate her. She is our mother after all. You're not making any sense. Mom is still our mother she used to be, and we are still so. Nothing's changed. It's been 15 years. Nothing's changed. It's okay if nothing's changed. Mom's back now, so just accept it. It can't stay the same. It can't be helped. We're stuck inside the dream ... we talked about that night. (Sapporo Sunflower: Round trip to Oarai and Tomakomai) Are you Mr. Hazuki? Yes. Kazuki? Dad? What are you doing? Kazuki! What the hell are you doing? They asked me to do it, I don't know. I don't know anything. You ... Don't tell me, you ... Drugs? Hey! Don't touch me. Don't stop! I'll make 200,000 for one haul. Money! I want money! I can get you the money you want. Drugs? When did you start it? Answer me! Shut the fuck up! Just drive me to my destination. Come on, drive me there. You used that money to buy drugs. It's too late to regret it by the time you come to your senses. So what? It's because I was born from a piece of shit like you. It's my fate! I can't refuse it. I can't resist this job, too. You owe money? How much money did you borrow to buy drugs? It's your fault. It's all your fault. Why? Why? Why! (The real face of the family is no longer there) (It's a family that exists in name only, it's a dead family) “No one will ever ... lay a finger on you again.” “So, you guys can live your lives the way you want.” “Live your lives freely.” “Be whatever you want to be.” Oh, here we are, huh? What is it? It's raining cats and dogs. I'm sick of it. I'm dying of thirst. Fucking hell! Get me some wine! “So, right now ... I'm so proud of myself.” Ah, Doushita. Huh? Is he drinking? Auntie? Eh? Daiki! Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! Huh? What? Moo just called. and said Mom is in Mr. Doushita's car. So what? The problem is she said Mr. Doshita was drinking. What to do? Now what? Radio. Call Mr. Doushita. Use the radio! Mr. Doushita? Mr. Doushita, do you hear me? Mr. Doushita, do you hear me? If you can hear me, give me an answer. Yeah, I heard you, asshole! Where are you now? It's none of your business. Where's my mom? Shut up! Sonoko. Mom? Mom, where are you now? Sonoko. What do we do? What to do? Yuji? Yuji? Yuji! Yuji. Wait a second. Yuji! - What are you doing? - Go after her. Let's call the police first. We don't have time to call the police. (Not carrying passengers) Which way did he go? Moo said she saw him on the bypass. What do we do? What if Mom disappears again? That's why we have to do something. We're not the same as we were back then. Yuji, is this okay? Don't worry, I've been forced to drive a million times. Aren't you driving too fast? You can't catch up if you drive too slow. It's raining so hard, you can't see ahead clearly. Be careful. Is that man really dead? Mom ... Mom didn't tell a lie. I think so. Sonoko. You will help her with her hair. What's that about? That's not important, is it? The important thing is we won't get beaten up and we'll be free to live. Damn it, I can't see her. Mom has to stay here and protect us! But that man is dead. So, we don't have to be afraid anymore, do we? Mom said there's nothing to be afraid of. We can be anything we want. I ... I told him I wanted to be a beautician and he beat the shit out of me. You're going to be a novelist, don't you? Even you're not a very good writer though. Shut up. What's wrong with that? I'll have to cut mom's hair when she gets back. How about you? What will you do? I ... I'm going to marry someone like mom. You're going to be just like that damn man! That's our cab, mom is in it! Yuji, go after them! Yuji! Yuji! I know. Hurry up! Faster! Hurry up, it's right there. Honk the horn! Yuji, hurry up! Mr. Doushita. Don't be like this, let's go home. I am to you. You're treated like a thorn in the side of your family. I can't stand it. So, I'll just let you die. No matter how hard the parents try, it's all for nothing. No one can feel it. Being blamed for anything. We're being blamed for anything. Don't give me that shit, asshole! Stop the car! Bastard! Yuji, what do we do now? What's going on with you and your son? No, no, you're wrong. What ... What kind of a son would do drugs like that? Don't be ridiculous. (Restricted area) You're like me, right? Right? It's not easy to make up your mind like that. But the kids ... they just ... don't get it at all. - Yuji! - Yuji. Let's just disappear into the ocean. The unwanted ... will be disappeared. What is he doing? Yuji! Yuji. Hold on tight. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Stop it. Stop it. No, no, no. Stop it. Don't! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Yuji, don't! Are you okay? What the fuck is wrong with you? Yuji! How? Fuck you. What the fuck are you doing? Asshole! Fuck you! Even though I'm a drunk, a drug addict and a former gangster I still working, and I'm a dad. What the fuck, man. I'm fine. Calm down. Mr. Doushita? Mr. Doushita? - Mr. Doushita? - Shut up! Go away! Mom! Hey! What the fuck do you want! Try it again! You son of a bitch! What do you want? How dare you push my mom! Don't go too far! You don't know how hard it is to be a parent! Why did I take your mom for? Blame the parents for the lack of success? You blame your parents for your bad luck? It's my fault anyway. I'll take the blame. Satisfied? Don't fight anymore. Hey! Listen up. He wrote nonsensical articles and putting his mother up for sale. Right? Shut up! You don't know anything. I have to succeed, no matter what the cost. Except for being able to write that. What's left? I taped the conversations that night. And wrote it all down. There were times when I thought I couldn't write it down. But I kept hearing my mom says “So, you guys can live your lives the way you want.” “Live your lives freely.” “Be whatever you want to be.” It's the freedom she gave us by killing our dad. Daiki. Sonoko. Isn't that so? Yuji. Then teach me. Teach me how to start over. Yuji. This man is not our dad. Did you know ... how happy I was that night? Mr. Doushita ... he's not your son either. Tell me. What was that night all about? That night ... It's just an ordinary night. No. Not that night. You're the only one who feels that night was special. To everyone else it's just an ordinary night. But, if you feel it was special that's enough. I will confirm it right now. Just a moment, please. Uta, can you go to Central Hospital right now? Roger. Aoki.

Don't you usually just use scissors and a comb? Shut up, amateur! Where the hell is she? She's not here either. Mom's getting impatient. Hey, what's wrong? Sonoko told Mom to wait there, but her tools ... - Found it. - Look. I'm going to borrow mom's hair today. Is that okay?
