I love his dwarfism. That's something that we say, like, "I liked your ism." - Coffee improves my quality of life. - Yeah. You know, there are certain characteristics involved with every type of dwarfism, and for achondroplasia, it's having bigger hips. And so Joe will walk up to me in a public space and whisper in my ear, "I liked your ism," meaning he likes my ass. [giggling] - I like big butts and I cannot lie. [relaxed music] ♪♪ [Joe] - I think there is this cultural understanding that when you see people like me, the core of the experience is negative.

[Joe's mother] - Are you making presentations? - In Houston, it's gonna be on disability, environmentalism, and gender. [Joe's mother] - Well, that's the newest thing now, right? - I don't think gender is new. It's been around a while. [Joe's father] - That's not what she's talking about, Joseph. [laughter] - Don't they-- Isn't that-- [Joe] - You talking about transgender? - Yeah. - That's--Well-- - That's not the same? [Joe] - Gender is just gender in general, right? Transgender is one variation on that. [Joe's father] - We're very proud of him. I mean, he's got a nice job, a nice wife, and his Phd. - Don't even ask me what he teaches because it's over my head. But oh, what does he teach? - Philosophy of some sort. [laughter] - "Most people seem to take it for granted "that disability is a bad thing, "and it's openly endorsed by many philosophers, "bioethicists, and public intellectuals "who favor the reduction or elimination of disability from human experience." "These differences, if visible or known, "will often play a subtle or not-so-subtle role "in shaping the character of one's interactions with others." - So, um, I understand that you are interested in achieving a pregnancy. - Yes! Sounds good to me. - Okay! - First, I want you to tell me... how old are you? - 34. - 34. - Do you smoke? - No. - Drink? - No. - And how many times have you been pregnant? - Once. - Okay. Tell me about that last pregnancy. - It was a year ago almost exactly. We miscarried at seven weeks. - Okay. So, was there an ultrasound done? - They diagnosed the miscarriage with an ultrasound. Yeah. [Doctor] - Okay. An ultrasound is what you need done between 11 and 14 weeks. That's where we offer every pregnant patient a risk assessment for genetic abnormalities. [Joe] - You know, whether or not the baby will be born with a disability, it is-- yeah, yeah. Of course it's something we've thought about somewhat. - We can arrange for a specific counseling from the genetic standpoint. [Joe] - It's certainly something that the doctors talk about a lot, right. - IVF and PGD, those are certainly some options to test the embryo. [Joe] - You know, I think they see normality as the end goal and just sort of assuming that, uh, normality is what any parent would want for their child. [dog barking] [Leah] - I really want a child. I would say that it's probably like the most basic evolutionary like, thing I've ever felt of I just want a kid! I think that every parent has a desire for their ideal child. You know, like some people think, "I really want a girl." But if they have a boy, it's not the end of the world. So, I have a desire to have a little person, but if we had an average-sized child, I think I will still get it on a level because I understand what it's like to be different than your family. - No leaves on the trees yet. - Not yet. - In a couple of weeks, they'll be there. This is the forest primeval. - [laughs] I'm not sure this is quite the forest primeval. I think there's been a lot of civilization imposed on this. When I was 27, my mother died of ovarian cancer. And my sense of loss about my mother not having lived long enough to come to a real and full acceptance was enormous. My father had seen me go through years of being alone, and through a serious depression. - You can't relive what happened before, the tragedies that you've had. The difficulties you've had in growing up are past, and you're very successful. So feel very blessed. We don't have everything. We don't have your mother, but we have a very good life. [Andrew] - I used to confuse love and acceptance, and through this whole process, I felt unloved by my parents. But as I went along, meeting all of these people and hearing their stories, I found that everyone who has kids has kids with flaws and problems, and nobody goes around saying, "I'd like to turn my kids in for a better model." You love your children. It isn't really up to you. They just have come along and changed you. [turn blinker on] [Trevor's Mom] - Every mother in the world would understand that a mother can't just stop loving a child. We just didn't see this coming. [Derrick] - Hey. Renting the truck. - Derrick Grace. [Trevor's Dad] - Yeah, Derrick Grace. - Are you guys moving into a home or apartment or... - Actually, we moved from here to Texas. But we left a few things back in the shed, so we're going to be clearing all of that out. - Oh God! - What? [crash] - Shh... - Lots and lots of pictures. There's Trevor. Our undefeated U-12 team. - Oh, yeah. He still had his braces. - These are all Trevor. Trevor driving his Jeep. Here's the journal. There you go. Take those pages out, and save it. - Oh, you know, that's all? - What? - There wasn't too much. [laughs] - I think the cops took a lot of the other stuff. I was at work and I got a call from the sheriff, and he said, you know, there's been a crime. He said it was Trevor, and so I'm thinking there's been some teenage thing. He's had a wreck. He's vandalized something. A squad car comes up and the deputy says, "You're Mr. Reese?" and I said, "Yes." He says, "Okay, come on. Let's go." He didn't tell me anything. It was just like, "Come on, we're gonna go." We went in, and that's when they tell me that a child has been killed and that, um, you know, that Trevor did it. And of course, I say, "You've got it all wrong. I want you to take me to see my son." But of course, you know, as soon as you see him that the worst has happened, and it is not going to be okay. Trevor got up that morning. He went out on the trail where we lived, and he waited until 8-year-old Jackson came by, and then he slit his throat. [Trevor's Mom] - Trevor was 16. The first time I saw him after I found out, he was shackled, and in prison stripes. [sobs] And we couldn't touch him. He was like, "I don't know why I did this." - Everybody was trying to figure out, you know, what went wrong and why-- why would a kid, you know, think like this. You know, because we raise our kids better that that up here. - I don't think that there's gonna be an issue of responsibility. I think it's gonna be an issue of what is his competency and his understanding and his mental status. [Trevor's Dad] - There were three psychiatrists, psychologists that we payed for, and there were two psychiatrists from the state. And they did everything. Scans and stuff for schizophrenia. They ran the test for sociopath, psychopath, the serial killer test. You know, all those kinda of issues. I kept thinking that one of those tests was going to say, you know, here's the ah-ha. But there wasn't. All they gave us was, "Yeah, your son is broken." - Some justice tonight for the parents of a murdered St. Francisville boy. Trevor Reese will spend the rest of his life behind bars. [Trevor's Dad] - Trevor pled guilty to murder. - Today is a very special day. It is Trevor's birthday. So, what we're going to do is on the count of three, we're going to sing as loud as we can "Happy Birthday" to Trevor, okay? One, two, and three. [all in unison] - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday Dear Trevor ♪ [Trevor's dad] - What was your favorite part of the day? - Riding Space Mountain. - All right! [woman] - Let's give Trevor a nice round of applause, okay? [clapping] [Trevor's dad] - All right. [girl giggling] [Trevor's Mom] - You literally go back to when they were in the cradle, and you wonder if you let him cry too long when you were trying to teach them to sleep. Should you have breastfed longer? I mean, you ask every question in the world. You ask yourself everything, and you keep coming back to... ...this happened. And we can't fix it. [insects chirping] [panting] [Trevor's dad] - That first month or two, I could have run straight on the street hoping to get run over. [panting] I thought, well, if I died, then that would help atone for the other death. But, uh... there is no reconciling on this issue. These is no magic. There's not a point. You'll just carry the guilt with you forever. [ceiling fan whirring] Whoa, good tackle! [chatter] - You should take the trash out. [Rebecca] - The trash doesn't come today. - But it's Saturday. It comes on Saturdays. It doesn't come on Sundays. - No. It doesn't come Fridays or Saturdays. - It's your turn. [Trevor's Mom] - We moved to Texas. [Tyler] - What kind of world are we living in? [Rebecca] - I don't know-- - Rebecca and Tyler, what are you all doin'? [Trevor's Mom] Sometimes people ask me if I have children, and I will say yes, I have an 18-year-old son in college and a sophomore in high school. And I don't mention Trevor. It's just, you know, a matter of not wanting to get into it, but not wanting to be dishonest. - Welcome, welcome! - Hi. - I'd get up, but I'm trapped! [laughter] [Trevor's Dad] - When you try to tell somebody, it just never goes well. You know, your son killed an 8-year old. There's nothing redeeming about that, and therefore, if that has happened in your family, then there must be something wrong with your family, your parenting, your whatever. [indistinct chatter] [Trevor's Dad] Like, Tyler and Rebecca both said, neither one of them want to have kids. Because they don't want... they're afraid. [Tyler] - I saw it like, tear Mom and Dad apart, and I don't want to have to deal with that myself. I don't think I have that in me. [Rebecca] - Everything with Trevor was like so out of the blue, and I feel like my parents did everything right, and then it just happened. Like, I would be afraid that that would happen to me. You know, I could work as hard as I could and love them as much as I could, and then something would still go wrong. [operator] - This is a call from an offender at a Louisiana Department of Correction facility. - What baby? - It'd be a volunteer thing or like a part time job? - I think it would be a next career, like, somewhere along the way, I'm going to be too old to teach, and maybe I should counsel or... - Are you sure? There are some pretty old ladies that do that. - [laughter] - When does it start? And how long is it? - It starts this summer. [operator] - You have one minute left. - Alright, mom. I'll call tomorrow. Alright? - I'm gonna leave Dad alone. I talked to him yesterday and the day before. - Oh yeah. All right. Just... All right. Love you.

[all] - No. [Trevor's Mom] - Yes, you got tender tummy. [Trevor's Dad] - In these past six years, I'd say we're much tighter and closer... [Trevor's Mom] - All right. I'm here. I'm here. - ...but we're afraid to expect too much. Because... we've lost so much. [Trevor's Mom] - There was a time where I felt like everything was a lie. Every family vacation picture I would look at, I felt like, here I was, thinking we were happy, and you were so miserable. It just felt like every time you and I laughed together was a lie. I was really angry. I took this picture when I went to see him Saturday. Isn't that cute? - That is cute. When did Trevor get glasses? [Trevor's Dad] - Um... - A couple months ago.
