ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAS FALLEN VICTIM TO HIS THEATRICS. FOR THE LATEST ON THIS STORY, WE GO TO CINDY VARGAS IN CERRITOS. THIS IS THE 10TH BANK IN AS MANY MONTHS TO BE ROBBED IN THIS FASHION. FEDERAL AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THIS STRING OF HEISTS TO BE THE WORK OF A SINGLE PERPETRATOR AND HAVE DUBBED HIM "HAMLET" DUE TO THE UNUSUAL WAY IN WHICH HE PERFORMS. IT SEEMS HE HAS A FLAIR FOR SHAKESPEARE, AND APPARENTLY HE'S GETTING SOME RAVE REVIEWS. I AIN'T NO EXPERT ON SHAKESPEARE, BUT HE WAS PRETTY DAMN GOOD. [Vargas] THE F.B.I. HAS TRACED HIS ILL-GOTTEN GAINS TO A NUMBER OF CHARITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE SEARCH FOR HAMLET CONTINUES. FOR K.G.A.B, THIS IS CINDY VARGAS REPORTING LIVE FROM CERRITOS. WHOO!

MAKE NO MISTAKE-- THIS ISN'T MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. I WANT HAMLET. JERRY AND I-- GOD REST HIS SOUL-- USED TO FIGHT JUST LIKE YOU TWO. ONE MORNING WE'RE GOING AT IT... FUNNY, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT, BUT I WASN'T GONNA GIVE IN. NEITHER WAS HE. SO I TOLD HIM... "I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU. "YOU JUST GET ON OUT OF HERE." OH, HOW SAD. DID HE LEAVE YOU? HE STORMED OUT THE DOOR, AND HE WAS SO BUSY CUSSING ME OUT THAT HE WALKED RIGHT IN FRONT OF A GREYHOUND BUS. SPLATTERED HIM ALL OVER MY AZALEAS. DO YOU LOVE HIM, HONEY? MORE THAN ANYTHING. MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. THEN DON'T WASTE TIME. YOU NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH YOU GOT LEFT. [Sirens wailing] [Terry] HONEY? HI. ARE YOU WATCHING? YEAH. NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T-- WHY? I KNOW, BUT WHY-- WHY SHOULD I? BECAUSE YOU SAY SO. OK, UM, ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT A LITTLE NEWS FOR YOU... BABY. THE DAYS OF YOU "SAYING SO" ARE OVER, OK? I'M NOT TURNING MYSELF IN.

[Sighs deeply] HOW'S IT GOING? THE SAME. SO I TAKE IT THEY FOUND OUT, HUH? WHAT? THE ARMY. BE ALL YOU CAN BE, BUT DON'T BE QUEER. [Scoffs] WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR GENDER PREFERENCE. [Laughs] I THINK ONE OF THOSE BULLETS MUST HAVE BOUNCED OFF YOUR HEAD. OH, YEAH? LOOK ME IN THE EYE, AND TELL ME I'M WRONG. [Laughing] YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. AM I? "THIS ABOVE ALL," BUZZ. "TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE, "AND IT MUST FOLLOW, AS THE NIGHT THE DAY, "THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN." I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU JUST SAID. [Crowd singing] ♪ AMAZING GRACE ♪ HOW SWEET THE SOUND ♪ THAT SAVED A WRETCH ♪ LIKE ME DECAF, RIGHT? YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE YOU JUST WANNA MOW DOWN THE WHOLE FUCKING CROWD? NO. YOU'RE YOUNG. GIVE IT TIME. ♪ BUT NOW I SEE WHERE ARE THE SNIPERS I ORDERED? A.T.F. WILL BE HERE WITHIN THE HOUR. CHOPPER? GASSED AND READY. I WANT YOU TO POSITION THE SHOOTERS ON THE ROOF OF THAT BANK AND ON THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. WE'LL BRING THE CHOPPER IN AT DAYBREAK, AND SET IT DOWN OVER THERE. WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR MOVE, THE SUN WILL BE IN THEIR EYES, AND WE'LL HAVE THEM IN A CROSSFIRE. NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO DID THE SHOOTING. WHAT ABOUT THE HOSTAGES? IT'S A TRAGEDY, CARTER. ♪ BUT NOW I SEE OHH, GOD! OH, GOD, I USED TO GET OFF ON IT, MAN. THE ADRENALINE RUSH. MISSION AFTER MISSION, I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH. AND THEN ONE DAY... I DROPPED MY FIRST HIT OF ACID, AND IT ALL CAME CLEAR. I TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT WE WERE DOING. I SAID IT WAS WRONG, SO I GROUNDED MYSELF. AND THE ONLY REASON THAT I AM NOT IN LEAVENWORTH IS BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING FOR THE ARMY TO ADMIT THEIR MOST CELEBRATED COPTER JOCKEY SUDDENLY DEVELOPED A MORAL CONSCIENCE. [Toilet flushes] SO THEY GAVE ME SECTION 8 AND SENT ME HOME. [Water runs] SO WHAT'S YOUR SAD STORY? OH, I, UH... I WASN'T EXACTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD MILITARY PROCEDURES. A REBEL, HUH? [Water stops running] I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT. I WAS DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS MAN'S ARMY. ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS A SOLDIER, TO SERVE MY COUNTRY, TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM. AND THEY TOOK ALL THAT AWAY FROM ME. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, SERGEANT. A UNIFORM DOES NOT MAKE A SOLDIER. A SOLDIER IS SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES IN, BE IT HIS GOD, HIS COUNTRY OR HIS FRIENDS. AND IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE BLACK, WHITE, RED, YELLOW, MALE, FEMALE, STRAIGHT OR GAY, WE ALL BLEED THE SAME. WELL, I WAS SURE THAT I HAD RUN DOWN EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE SCENARIO OF WHAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG TODAY, BUT THIS ONE WINS THE PRIZE. HOPE, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA GO ON WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR. I KNOW THAT. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER, BUT I KNOW. YOU STILL-- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME IN HERE. IT, UH... WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, WAIT AT THE ALTAR? CATCH YOU ON TELEVISION? WAIT TO FIND OUT IF YOU WERE... I LOVE YOU. I HAD TO COME. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE. YOU CAN'T. YOU KNOW, SCREWING UP MY LIFE IS ONE THING, BUT I'M REALLY TIRED OF SCREWING UP YOURS. YOU NEED TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING BETTER-- TO SOMEONE BETTER. HOPE... I'M LETTING YOU GO. [Giggles] OH. REALLY? Y-YEAH. [Laughs] THAT IS SO... THAT'S SO... MALE! HA! "I'M LETTING YOU GO." OH, WELL... IF I COULD'VE LET YOU GO, I WOULD'VE LET YOU GO A LONG TIME AGO. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE "TILL DEATH DO US PART," AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD JUST DROP THE MACHO SHIT. IF THAT'S REALLY THE WAY YOU FEEL, THEN I DON'T THINK THAT YOU LEAVE ME ANY OTHER CHOICE.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE OR ANYTHING BUT MYSELF, RIGHT? UM, ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA ASK YOU IF YOU'D STAND UP WITH JESSE INSTEAD OF STANDING WITH THE HOSTAGES. COME ON, HOPE. HE DIDN'T EVEN INVITE ME. YOU DID. YES, AND YOU DIDN'T STEAL THE RING. HE DID. YOU CAN'T KEEP BLAMING YOURSELF FOR HIS MISTAKES. NO, BUT I CAN FOR MINE. LOOK, I'M THE ONE WHO REFUSED TO PLEA BARGAIN, I'M THE ONE WHO TOOK IT TO TRIAL, I'M THE ONE WHO LOST. WHAT PLEA BARGAIN? THAT'S RIGHT. I DIDN'T TELL HIM. DO YOU GET THE PICTURE? I WANTED TO GO TO TRIAL, I WANTED TO PROVE MYSELF, SO I DIDN'T TELL HIM. [Sighs] I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. JESUS, HOPE, I TOOK HIS LIFE AWAY. I TOOK YOUR LIFE AWAY. SO... HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME NOW?

I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE BRANDISHING WEAPONRY DURING THE CEREMONY. WE'RE IN A BANK. WELL, WE'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD, AND WE'LL BE RECITING THE WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR, AND THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS. [Clears throat] [Priest] IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THESE, I LIKE TO START BY READING FROM THE SCRIPTURES. LET US PRAY. "AS THE APOSTLES GATHERED AROUND HIM, "JESUS LOOKED UPON THEM WITH GREAT SORROW, "FOR HE KNEW THAT ONE OF THEM "WOULD BETRAY HIM. "HE STOOD BEFORE THEM AS BOTH JUDGE AND JURY "AND WITH A HEART FULL OF FORGIVENESS, SAID--" FREEZE! [Gasps] MEDIC! DO IT, I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL KILL YOU.
