I need the gray suit, a shirt and the other shoes. - Want me to wake up your dad? - He wouldn't want to see me... It'd be the best. No... No you can't help me with anything. I'll fix this myself. What happened, Manuel? The Customs people, they wanted to kill me. - Isn't there a clean shirt? - I'll bring it for you. - Why are you tearing off your pictures? - That way they can't identify me. - Do I burn the papers? - Yes. The shoes are stained with blood... and the suit as well! - And the pants! - Burn everything! Out the way, Captain! Where do you plan on sleeping today? I don't know... in a hotel, or wherever possible. Whatever won't burn, and the ashes, throw them in the gorge. Take this money, son... You might need it. - Thanks! - Manuel... - Little Esperanza... - Why don't you stay and sleep, Manuel? I have to go. Goodbye, mom! Goodbye, Little Esperanza! - I had to shoot the guards. - Did you kill them? - I think so. - How many? - Two. - What are you going to do? - Leave this town. - And go where? Anywhere... yes... It's for the best. - Goodbye! - Goodbye. RED CHRONICLE I was the last to leave the building, at around 8 PM. The guards stayed with someone, I don't know who he was. Force open the door! It's 7:50 in the morning, the Judge on duty of the Permanent Central, in association with his secretary, the medical examiner, and the forensic lab experts, moved to the building of Customs Administration of this town, in order to take the bodies of two men violently dead, in that office, according to telephone notice that was given to this court. I left them talking outside. I came early, - because of the amount of work... - At what time? At 7:00. I found the main gates open. I found it strange. I called the guards, but nobody answered. Then I headed to the Administration office until Carmelita arrived. I didn't see anyone come in, either... - Who found the bodies? - Pedro. The building's lifter. The lady asked me to come up and see what was going on. I heard the radio inside and... as the door was closed, I peeked through the opening. Through there I saw the bodies. ... that surely, when they fell, came off his face... and a big blood stain surrounding it. Period. In the following act, the medical examiner proceeded to examine the bodies. The body, which we'll call number one, presented a wound on the right scapula, without a tattoo or an exit hole. As one of the guards made his rounds, the other slept in this room. What were the guards' names? Manuel Antonio Fonseca and Flaminio Villarreal. There are three projectile wounds on the eastern wall, and four in the southernmost wall. However, a firearm hasn't been found. At what time should the guards mark the clock? - Every hour. - Mr. Judge... The last marked hour was at midnight. Here. Possible cause of death: internal hemorrage caused by destruction of the aortic arch. I need to tell Mr. Judge, that the detainee kept under custody of the guards is Manuel Albarrán, accused of contraband by the Customs Captaincy, yesterday afternoon. Go get the rice and the meat. They gave the news at midday on the radio that they'd killed the two guards and that the only detainee was Manuel. The whole neighbourhood knows. How did Manuel tell you events had occurred? That the Customs people were to kill him... And that he had to shoot them. So he shot them with his own revolvers. I know Manuel killed the cops, and that the girls from the school knew and told the teacher. That's why I don't want to return to study. What does the school have to do with it? All day they were telling me that my brother is a killer. He's not a killer! And the ones he killed weren't cops, but some guards who wanted to kill him. He wasn't going to let it happen! Juan Antonio Albarrán? That's me, sir. I have a court order to search your house and detain you. - For what reason? - For the hiding of Manuel Albarrán. - My son isn't here. - That's what we're here to see... Relax... relax... - I don't know. - You don't know? We're not finding any guns. There aren't, and there will never be guns in my home. - And your son's identification? - He'd have it. How much has it been since you saw him last time? Today... on the course of the day? It's been over a week since I saw him. Manuel and I are estranged. Estranged? Yes, because he doesn't work, and he's with bad people. As long as he doesn't turn up, you are detained. In my 55 years of age, I've never been detained, nor had issues with the law, nor known a jail. Now you'll know one. At what time did Manuel come this morning? - He hasn't come today. - And yesterday? It's been over a week since he came. He's out of town. - Where? - That I don't know. - He's just fled home. - No one has fled my home. You can see what we were just eating. - I don't lie. - You can tell it to the Judge. In the meantime, come with us. Hit him! Whoever says, one more time, that my brother is a killer, I swear to God I'll kill him! Who hit him? They kicked me out of school. Where's mom? Inside, talking to a man... the man that makes suitcases. - What the hell happened to your eye? - I had a fight with a boy that was badmouthing Manuel And the principal kicked me from school. That's all I needed. - I'll talk to that bastard tomorrow. - Don't bother talking to him, because I don't think I'm coming back, nor do I want to see anyone. And what will you do if you won't study? Get in trouble all the time, like Manuel? Don't even think of it! I'll see what I'll do. If you want, I'll work. Let's see what your father says once he's released. Go with your mom. Juan Antonio Albarrán! I've brought your food. - Why doesn't your mom come to see me? - She couldn't leave the house alone... - You can look after it. - And the girl? Leave her with you, or bring her here. To a jail? What does anything matter! - At least, did she send a message? - She only sent food. She didn't say anything... that's just how she is. We're just arriving. Up ahead, in the yellow house. here it is! I'll help you bring everything in. Come in. - Did you bring everything? - Almost everything. - Did you bring the closet? - The closet is my dad's. What do you want it for, if he says he'll return to his town once he's let free? He'd want to sell it... besides, it didn't fit in the wagon. If he wants to sell it, let him sell it. And the dining table? Yes, I've brought it. It's under the mattresses. Víctor Manuel Albarrán has been caught, presumed suspect of the double homicide in Customs. The prófugo was trying to head to the border when the police... - What's in the package? - A cake. Undress! - Manuel! - Mario... - How are you, Manuel? - He's my brother. José Luis Hiquera, at your service for everything you need, young man. Master of sleight of hand. He can make any kind of personal objects disappear, owned and not, especially wallets. Don't listen to him, those are little Alberta's exaggerations. Fabio Alberto Ospina for you, who is a decent person. How'd the body search? They're making all the visitors undress. Did they put the seal on you? Careful that it doesn't come off, or else they'll leave you to rot here for two or three years. With these modern systems they have to control visits... I've brought you a cake and some cigarettes. Thanks. I didn't know how to find them. It's because we changed neighbourhoods. - Why's that? - It was his idea. The other was a snitch's neighbourhood. - Dad's idea? - No, he's still in jail. Does he know he was detained after your issue? He says it was concealment... He'll be released soon. Now that you've already been caught... I didn't know. He'll sue them for illegal detainment. That's what I'm saying, but he's depressed. He's very jaded. - Because of me! - Because of everything. Mom won't even visit him. I'm the one that goes to give him his food. Miguel is the one who takes care of the house now. - Who are you talking about? - You know him. He had a workshop to make suitcases under the church. He's living with mom. And dad? He already knows. He barely speaks anymore. He wants to return to his town as soon as he's let free. I'd go with him, but I've found a job. - He left school. - I couldn't handle it anymore. Now I'm working in a lawyer's office. - And what do you do? - I'm a messenger. It's bad that you've stopped your studies. But I'm... saving up. Maybe I'll attend night school one day. - And how is the girl? - Fine. - She's still in school. - And the dog? It's been days since Captain was killed by a car. Anyway, he doesn't like animals. With how much money did you enter the Customs building? With some 11 or 12 pesos. Some dice were found on the guards' bodies. Tell me if between you and them, you didn't start some game with the money you had, and the one they might've had. No, sir. I don't even know how to play dice. - Good to see you're free! - I was released last week. Mario found out that he was being investigated today and so we decided to come say hello. I'm being taken back to jail just now. We'll go visit him on Sunday. - I'm heading home. - I'll walk with you to the bus stop. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Thanks. - Manuel is here with some cops. - What? They got here just now. - And what are they doing? - Drinking beer. They're gonna eat here. Mom's making them food. He's my brother. - Carlos Mario Albarrán. - Pleasure to meet you. So you're Manuel's brother. Good man, this Manuel, regardless of the rumours. We'll finish this beer and we'll leave. Don't even think about leaving the house without eating. - Mom's making you food. - Precisely, it's served. - Come over to the dining room, please. - It's not too much of a bother, madam? Of course not. Manuel's friends are home here. Lets bring the beer to the table. Sorry for the improvised meal, I had no idea you were coming. It's very nice of you to allow my son to visit me here. Mario, head to the store and get more beer. There are glasses in the kitchen. In all sincerity, I hope Manuel goes free. It couldn't be more evident that he acted in legitimate defense. That's what the jury has to understand. Do you think there's any hope in the audience? - Plenty! - You never know, in my opinion. I've seen plenty of innocents sentenced. - Depends on the jury's humor. - Exactly. - But we have to be optimistic. - I don't have a choice. You don't know how much you help me by bringing Manuel here. - For a little while, at least. - I have kids too, madam. Three kids, isn't that right? Two girls and a boy. Look at the pictures. They're precious. - What's the eldest's name? - Little Marta... Marta Luz. Excuse me for a moment, I'm going to the bathroom. I'm leaving. Hide the guns! Quickly, because you leave for the other street there! Manuel has a good heart, deep down. He's a bit crazy, which is why he got involved in this contraband issue. Mom, how many beers do you want me to bring? - A dozen. - Make sure they're nice and cold. No, no. No more beers. We need to leave. At what time must you return to the jail? We have to be there already. We don't know at what time the interrogations end! There's no rush. Manuel asked us to let him see his mom, so now we're here. Once again, thank you so much... But eat, so you get there on time. - I'll go make you some dessert. - That's very nice of you, madam. Where'd your brother go? - To the store, to buy the beer. - No, Manuel! - To the bathroom, right? - Where's the bathroom? Over there, next to the kitchen. He's gone! He's gone! - What do you mean he's gone? - He's escaped! I told you we shouldn't have accepted the beers at the store. Even less, to bring him here! - I'm sure you gave him money! - Don't insult me. Lets get the guns, quickly! There's a boy waiting for you at the office, I don't know why. Second floor. Mario! Your brother needs to see you. Go look for him and get him clothes. Where is he? You can find him at the shoehorn field, at the Manrique neighbourhood. - If you want, I can take the things. - I can't right now. I'm working. Tell him I'll go later. - I've come to bring you your clothes. - Thanks. I got a passport. I'm leaving this shit country, to where there's money. That's wise, friend. Here, being honourable isn't profitable. Only robbery. Not even that, brother. I've brought you shirts, underpants, the blue suit, two drill pants, a tie, and some handkerchiefs. Give me another beer. I'm gonna play some other records. Put your hands up! Move! Come here, you bastard! Once and again, you dog! Come here, you bastard! Son of a bitch! Dog! Mario, don't ruin your life defending what is undefendable. Your brother's luck is decided by the law. And there's nothing else to say. As for you, I'm going to send you to a work school. Not to a correctional facility, as I could, but a better place. And I give you my word, if I receive good conduct reports, I'll let you go in a few months. But... forget about doing anything else for Manuel. - You promise? - Yeah, I promise. Then, I wish you the best of luck. The Judge's Order. Okay. Come with me to rectory. How old are you, Carlos Mario? 15. You studied until your last year of high school... - But I didn't finish the year. - Why? There were only problems for me at school. Well, according to the Judge's opinion, you're a boy with a good heart. Let's see if that's true. We study in the mornings here. Now the boys are eating. Take Carlos Mario to the dining room. "I saw in the sky, another great, admirable sign, 7 angels that brought the 7 last plagues, with which God's ire was consummated". "I also saw as a sea of glass mixed with fire..." The Chief Principal sends him. Sit over here, in the meantime. ... "and those who'd achieved victory, over the beast and his image". - Your brother was on the newspaper. - Today? - Today. - And what did it say? That he had a knife fight with another inmate in jail over gambling issues. And that they took them both to the hospital, wounded. - Where do you have the paper? - I read it passing by. It wasn't mine. Some journalists went to interview them at the hospital. So then it's not that serious. No... He almost killed the poor inmate. The Customs issue was also related to gambling, isn't that true? I went to visit Manuel in jail as soon as he was released from the hospital. - Did he ask for me? - Yes, he did ask... - How's his case? - They're taking it to public audience. - He got assigned a public defender. - Well? That's how it seems. Serves as propaganda for the lawyer... As Manuel's been on the papers so much... Keep these 10 pesos if you need them. Has someone come to visit you? My mom once, to bring me a cake that they stole from me here. The other boys? Yes, but there hasn't been trouble since they found out I'm Manuel's brother. Your brother isn't escaping this time. It'd be best for you to leave. Don't stay here. Notice blood's dripping from your hands. Don't wash your hands, because the water is dirty. Hand me the bill they gave you this morning! - I'm telling you to hand me the bill! - You'll have to kill me! Calm down, man. The problem's not with you. It's under the mattress! It's completely illegal what they did with your brother. That of questioning him without a lawyer present, - violates the Constitution. - He didn't have what to pay one with. He should've been assigned a public one since the very beginning. - He has one now. - It's no use now. Your brother's statement is very well-written. The contradictions will start to be more apparent in the public hearing. Carlos Mario Albarrán... The Principal needs you. I have good news for you, Carlos Mario. According to my reports of your good behaviour, the Judge has revoked his Order, and has set you free. I wish you good luck... and may God be with you. Best of luck! You're saying, Sr. Albarrán, that from the beginning you were under the custody of one of the guards. - The oldest. - So, of Manuel Antonio Fonseca's. - I didn't ask for his name. - That's the name of your victim. If you say so... And around 23:15 or 23:30, Fonseca's partner arrived from the street, half drunk. - That's right. - So you remember the exact hour! At around 23:15 or 23:30. How did you know? - I saw it on my watch. - The one you have on right now? No. A fan gifted this to me. I had to sell the other one to buy sealed paper and stamps. Silence! I warn the assistants in this process, that I will have the room cleared out if you don't behave with the due respect to the solemn act that is being carried out. Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. At around 23:15 or 23:30, Greenwich time, the other guard arrived, and... what happened then? He ordered me to go up to the room where they sleep. He sat me down on the bed in front of him and took off his coat and shirt. Where did he have his gun? - In his pants. - In his pants! He didn't take them off. No. Proceed. He slapped me and said: "You'll have to confess where the contraband ended up". He shook me by the shirt and I took the opportunity to grab his gun. Where did he have it? On his waist. Then, I jumped back and ordered for him to put his hands up. In that moment, the other guard showed up at the room. - And so, you shot him? - No. It was the old guy that shot first. However, you were not wounded. No. Then, I had no other choice but to shoot him. When the old guy fell, he knocked his partner's gun on the ground. The other guy took it from the bed where it fell. I threw myself at him, and with my hand prevented him from shooting me. I couldn't overpower him and so I had to shoot him. Why, by violating the law, didn't you turn in Albarrán to lawful justice... so he could be detained in the common prison establishments that are for all citizens, but, on the contrary, you held him at the Customs offices? It's because, members of the Jury, the 3134th decree gifts all the whistleblowers of contraband goods 25% of the value of those same goods, which is why, the Customs employees had personal interest in finding out, using whatever it took, the whereabouts of the supposed contraband, which Albarrán was accused of. Don't forget, members of the Jury, what could be the mindset of a detainee, who is with hostile people, armed, abusing their position, with the complicity of solitude, and the night. Who takes off their clothes at midnight, to torture a detainee? Villarreal's body was found barely clothed, because he was sleeping. He wasn't sleeping! You say Villarreal took off his coat and his shirt, and remained only with pants. Why's that? Because that's the only way to explain that he had his gun on his belt, where he intends to have removed it. It's obvious that inbetween his underpants and his body, the gun wouldn't have stayed on. This card marks 24:00 hours. The last time that Fonseca left the room, got down to the yard and marked it on his control watch. In an excess of trust, he left you in the room listening to the radio, as his partner slept. But you, taking advantage of the situation, took over Villarreal's gun. You waited for Fonseca to come back in the darkness of the stairs, and safely and securely, you shot him, causing his death. Murderer! Murderer! Murdered, who killed my father! Shut up, you old bitch! - Shut up! - You killed him! Yes, you killed him! Shut up! Get this crazy lady out of here! I will have the police evacuate the room! The Prosecutor speaks as if he's presented the facts, being that there isn't human testimony different from that of the processed. God is a witness. Albarrán knows in the depths of his conscience, that that is how the incident occurred. In the name of Flaminio Villarreal's family, and the family of Manuel Antonio Fonseca, and the name of society, I ask for the sentencing of Manuel Albarrán. Members of the Jury, answer "No" to the questionnaire that'll be handed to you, so you won't burden yourselves for the rest of your existence, with the remorse of having condemned an innocent man. The oral debates are now hereby finished and the jury's deliberation period has begun Clear out the room. Manuel! Best of luck to you! The questionnaire put into consideration for the members of the jury, states the following: "The accused, Víctor Manuel Albarrán is responsible: yes or no, of having deliberately murdered Manuel Antonio Fonseca and Flaminio Villarreal, according to the events which occurred between the 14th and 15th of January, and the facts occurred with the victims being found in conditions of defenselessness and inferiority". Scrutiny now concluded, by unanimous decision, the members of the Jury, reached the following verdict: "Yes, he is responsible". Please! Please! Excuse me! Please! Don't push me! Please! Don't push me! Let me through! Let me through! Me first! Don't push me! One day, early in the morning, when I went to visit Manuel in jail, I saw that the guards' wives were allowed to leave them breakfast. - You never noticed? - No. You don't know what happens in the guards' room when you're outside. Well, for their breakfast to come in, they have to open the metallic door. - I hadn't noticed. - That's right. And through that door, the inmates' deliveries also come in. But by the Judge's order, visit days. - Or special days. - There aren't special days in jail. Yes there are... like when they transfer an inmate to another jail. Then it's not suspicious for family members to send them clothes, or something like that... As he's already leaving... Manuel will be transferred from jail so he serves his sentence. - Is he a good guy? - He's a serious guy. - Why was he in jail? - For armed robbery. They gave him four years, and three were discounted. How did he do it? He played mad and was taken to an asylum. From there he came out as a psychiatrist. And he took a writing machine on his way. Get up! I'm going to get Manuel out of jail. I don't know if you all will be capable of coming with me. And how the hell are you getting him out? By the door where he came in. You're crazy! You were the crazy one. Or aren't the entry doors also exits? But that's in the asylum. That's anywhere. And what do you gain from getting him out? Look at the headings on the papers. Look at their size. And with pictures, to boot. Your brother is already quite famous. In a few days there won't be anyone who remembers. This country is very big, and you can hide whoever. - It'd be a matter of luck. - Life is a matter of luck. That's true. We got to this neighbourhood when we came to the city. From where did you come? From my town, El Carmen. - El Carmen? - Yes. My brother is from there. - I know. - You already knew? We knew each other as kids. I thought you'd met in jail. No. It's been a while since I ate any oranges. - What time is it? - Close to 7:00. You know what I'd like to have? A nice watch. Who's permission do I ask to deliver these clothes to my brother? Ask the Chief Warden. - Who is that? - The officer on that desk. Chief, I came to take these clothes to my brother, - who's being transferred today. - Who's your brother? Manuel Albarrán. Albarrán... Leave them there, they'll be delivered later. Could I talk to him, for at least a little while? I don't get to decide that. The Commanding Officer decides, and he's inside. As he's being transferred, who knows when I can see him again. Tell the Commanding Officer that you want to see Albarrán. - Where is he? - He went in to call an inmate. If you want, you can go in and wait for him. Can I get in to the Directions Office? - Do you have family here? - A brother. Dear God, what terrible weather we're having! I have to leave quickly, because when it rains, my whole street floods and the water gets in my home. In my neighbourhood, when it floods, we've had to cross the streets with planks. - Manuel, we've brought you clothes. - Great! I really needed them. - Is everything okay? - Yes, of course. - Everything's ready. - Already? They say I'm being transferred today. Isn't the guard here? A lady needs him here. Let me open that, madam. He was killed! Follow them! Let's go! Stop and lets kill those motherfuckers! Shoot him down soon before our tire gives out! Attention! Attention! Stop the white Cadillac, model 51 which is heading north! Attention! Attention! North checkpoint! Stop the white Cadillac model 51 which is heading towards you! The one driving was a terrible man, with black sunglasses and a white poncho, and he covered his nose and mouth, so he couldn't be recognized. The other one was a bit older, but he didn't speak a word. The driver was brown-skinned. He had a green, plaid cap. I remember very well. He was around 40 years old. No, he was much younger! And the cap was black and white. How many were in the car? - There were five. - No, there were three. The boys you mention, were they armed? Of course! Armed to the teeth! The youngest had an emblem on his buttonhole with a bull's head. He said his brother was detained here, I mean, Albarrán. - Manuel shot the guard? - Of course! No! Remember, the one who shot was the other one! How many got down from the car? I saw four get down and five leave. Six, counting the little brother. You, as a criminal lawyer, what do you think of Albarrán? Albarrán is qualitatively progressive within what is criminality, because... step by step, sometimes, and dizzily, on other occasions, in his criminal journey, he's been exceeding himself. The danger in him reaches the maximum level, since his intelligence is on an equal level with his material practice of his audacity. You, Dr. Villarreal, as director of the penitentiary, have you ever met Albarrán? What's your opinion of him? Albarrán is an insignificant guy. He doesn't have the traits that the public and the press have given him. He's a mock hero, those tabloids make up, every once in a while. That guy, people worship him, because he's viewed as some "captain of crime". Let him be captured, and you'll see. - Do you recognize him? - Yes, he was the one driving. Antonio Hiquera Refuge. Also known as "the leftie"... or José María Gonzalez, or César Augusto Niño or Julio César Rojas, or Carlos Arturo Hernández. With those names he's known in gambling dens, jails and mental hospitals. He's little Antonio. He lived in the hood, but when he was a boy. Very naughty, by the way. A bad person. On the contrary, very nice, charitative man. He bought me a beer once. I remember very well. Have you known anything of him? Yes, that he's a millionaire and that he's living in the US. How did he become a millionaire? Well, stealing! What other way! Eleven. If you have anything else to bet... I'm going with poncho. - Against 10 pesos. - 20. Alright. Get up, there's room for everybody here! Scoot over a bit, Toña, let's see if we can fit everyone! You're lucky, friends... Lucky you found a bus, at this time. Give the driver your thanks, he stopped for over 3 hours, as soon as we left Camayagua. What happened to that piece of junk, José Antonio? They told you already, Luis, the transmission is bust. I don't know jack about mechanics. What I do know is that if thieves attack, the transmission, they're gonna bust it for us. - Holy Mary forbid! - Do the gentlemen drink spirits? I do accept. - And the boy? - Well, you see. When I travel in these hunks of junk, I always come prepared, because you never know. When one of these bastards gets distracted when driving, you end up on one of those ditches that no one sees, but they're there. And the victims are never shown, not even on the papers. Aren't you Saint Juan de la Sierra? No. - Are you a traveling agent? - Not that, either. I've seen you somewhere. I remember faces very well. I never forget a face. I could've been a detective, had I only never married. I have a romantic soul, that of an adventurer, but in this damn quiet town where nothing every happens, where one doesn't do anything but take signature after signature, and property after property, and death, like those from last week: 20 at a time. A true massacre! When thieves go after a bus that's filled with passengers, right here, up ahead, putting big stones on the road, so they'd stop. And then, everyone was cruelly murdered, without respecting women, not even children. Well, let's not be so pessimistic, as Mr. Jesus says... I'll present you all, and I'll also present Toñita, the director of the nursing home in Camayagua. Pleasure, gentlemen! Well, let's put aside the pessimism, musicians, play something! - Good idea! - Pass the spirits to the gentlemen! Yeah, man! Play something! - Let's play something, partner. - Let's play something. # The people are saying that you're a whore # You try to look decent but bang whoever # When you go out on the street with your little painted face # Just by looking at your waist soon you're easy # Whore, whore # Lost in the immense obscurity # Whore, whore # You look like the pure truth # When it's nighttime now you hang out by the street # As if you had a car, they call you the whore # And even though I'm a player, I messed up with you # If I don't step aside, you'll take my by the tie - We're fucked now! - The thieves! We'll have to shoot the bastards. Wait, brother... let's see what happens. We need to get down to get those rocks off the way. It's best to turn back. They could be waiting for us up ahead. For what? They could also be behind us. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth... This is what I was saying! - What happened? - A rockslide blocked the way. - How long ago? - Over an hour. What happened with the thieves? I don't think they'll take a chance, with this much people. There were some rocks on the way. They could be rocks that they rolled. Could be... There are many rockslides at this time of the year. - What's happening? - Seems like there was a rockslide. Dear Sargeant, that rockslide didn't fall on us, by the grace of the Lord. But the thieves must be wandering somewhere around here. They put rocks on the way, to stop us. I can't explain why they didn't attack. - Maybe it was rockfall. - The true rockfall is over there. Say, I know where I've seen you before! On the papers! You're a cyclist, isn't that right? Yes! Yeah, man. You're very pale. It's just that... after all, I have 5 kids, a wife, and a grandson. I don't worry about myself, but I worry about them... Lets drink some schnapps, it won't hurt. And if you disagree so much with the government, why don't you quit? I'd do it, but with a wife and 5 kids... Tell us, what's your wife like, in short? - She's a beauty. - Then, what are you complaining about? I'm not complaining... It's just that I have a sentimental and romantic soul, like Lord Byron. You know who that is? - No. - What would you know! With these republican governments that don't educate the people! One has to read, to know what one's missing out on! To open up your spirit! To break the fence of these miserable mountains, that don't let a soul grow... - You're right. - ... and let the imagination fly, at least, far away from this monotony, from this land of tedium, where nothing ever happens! Go ahead! - Who's box is this? - It's mine! - What's inside? - Something for my friend. Trying to sneak some hallucinogenic rum to the Uniona, eh? Let's go with the Sargeant. Everyone else, you can pass. I can wait 10 minutes for you! Then, I'll have to leave without you! We're screwed, man... I snuck my gun into the old guy's box. Hey! We better leave, who knows how long they'll detain the old guy! - I'll go to the bathroom. - Let's go! And you, where the hell did you hide the gun? Are we going to wait too much? If the old guy isn't released soon, we'll leave. I'd say... So besides contraband liquor, you're carrying unlicensed firearms? - What did you say your name was? - Filiberto González, at your service. Don't you know it's considered contraband to sneak liquor from a department to the other? That's not something I made up. It's legislation of departmental renting. As for the presence of a gun in your things, you can't explain it... Someone had to put it there... you didn't say who... who was it? Stop the van! Please! Albarrán is in there! That's how I knew him! The guy behind me... Yes, I saw him on the papers! - Are you sure it's Albarrán? - Yes. It can't be, dear Sargeant. Look what it says on the papers... UNDER GUNFIRE AND GRAVELY WOUNDED ALBARRÁN ESCAPED FROM JAIL. Was the guy you say is Albarrán wounded? - No. - Are you sure it's Albarrán? He's the one in the pictures. The pictures! The pictures never look like the person! Another one of the victims of Albarrán escape, dies in the hospital. How many have there been? Yes, I know him. He lives on the other block. Your wife is the one leaving the store. - Want me to call her? - That won't be necessary. Thanks. Goodbye! Score a lot of goals. Hear, hear, beauties! In the course of the month, only pawns and butler, have stolen four cows from me. Last week, the skeleton of one showed up. It was stuck in a gully! Another one was stung by a snake. Another, fell down a defile. And the other one was struck by lightning! Isn't it so strange, that having the entire planet to strike, lightning struck my cow! And the police? What does the police do? Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! The Albarrán are loose on the streets, getting in and getting out of prison like it's nothing. Hey, Mr. Antonio María, don't talk like that about the Albarrán, here present! The Albarrán? Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Call the police! Call the police! I'll call them. Put the gun on the table. You're right, Mr. Antonio María. One can't live in this country anymore. TWO ROOMS FOR RENT The rooms are upstairs. We put the rooms for rent so we can pay the house. My husband's employed but makes very little. He works at the telephone company as an electrical technician. - There, I'm at your service. - Thanks. And what do you do? We came to town on business affairs. - I'd like some more buttered bread. - Me too. Hurry up boy, or you'll be late for school. - Are your rooms all ready? - Yes, mom. He's already studying. The other one, not yet. But I start next year, right dad? Yes, kid. I'd like to wash some clothes. - The laundry is on the roof. - Thanks. - Police! - Where? All over the street! Attention! Attention! The inhabitants of Porto Carrero street, with the numbers 97, 95, 93, 92, 90 and 87, get out with your hands up. Attention! Attention! This is a police order! The inhabitants of Porto Carrero street, get out with your hands up! Acting with the most absolute discretion, the police has tracked down the whereabouts of the fugitives to a house in Porto Carrero street. What's going on? Who are you? How many cops! Are they chasing you all? Please, let us go! They let them go... now we're screwed. Manuel Albarrán and company, you're surrounded! Get out with your hands in the air! As listeners may recall, Víctor Manuel Albarrán came to justice when he was detained for supposed contraband, without a trial and in the most insensible way, he was left a prisoner at night in the offices of Customs, under the custody of its guards. That same night, the detainee killed the guards with a gun... Clear something up for me, brother, and excuse the question... What happened that night with the guards at Customs? What happened that night? The Prosecutor already said... That, only me and God saw. God doesn't meddle in that stuff, and me... Manuel Albarrán and company, come out with your hands in the air! Fire!
