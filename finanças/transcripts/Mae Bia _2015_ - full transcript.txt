IN THE CAGE BANGKOK 9.30 AM Hello. Mekhala's speaking. Good morning, Mae. Don't recognize my voice? How could I not recognize a charming boy like you? Am I right, Pakbhumi? Want to have dinner with me tonight? How about tomorrow night? I am going to Singapore with my boss tomorrow and get back on Saturday night. How about Sunday night? Definitely not on Sunday, Pakbhumi. I'm a guide for a cultural trip in Bang Plama, my hometown. -That's perfect. -How so? My boss, Chanachol, is looking for a traditional Thai house. I've been searching many places but he's still not happy. If he likes your place, you might get about... 30 to 40 million Baht. How about that? Sorry, I will never sell my house to anyone. I'm just kidding. You are the only person I know who can give him some good advice on old houses. Confirm the date with my secretary. I gotta go now. See you then. Okay, fine. I'll take Chanachol on that trip to your place on Sunday. Good morning. Good morning, Pakbhumi. Good morning. Right. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Morning. -Morning. The Oriental Marina project has been approved by the Australians. Mr. Johnson will be joining our meeting. -Good morning, Dad. Hi, Chanachol. -Bhumi. Mr. Johnson will give you his confirmation on the date of his arrival to Phuket. Yes, dad. Have you found an old Thai house for him yet? I think I found it. Where is it? In Bang Plama, Suphan Buri. It's Mae's house. That's good. Well, I gotta go. Yes, Uncle Dirake. The house's owner is gorgeous. A cage. We are all prisoners in an invisible cage. Can we find our freedom? Nobody knows the answer. But for me, being the owner of a traditional, old Thai house might be the answer that I've been looking for. AT THE OLD HOUSE That's the reason... BANG PLAMA, SUPHAN BURI - 3 PM ...why I'm cruising along the Suphan river on the day after my business trip to Singapore, and despite always feeling nervous on boats. Now we're cruising along Ta Chin river. Locals call it Suphan river. People make a living by cultivating fish and shrimp farms in Bang Plama. The tape-grasses over there are edible. This cultural trip might be a new thing for Chanachol. You have such a pretty name. Have you ever been drowned? Please give him a round of applause. He's a new member of our group. Are you thinking of your billion-dollar joint venture? Nice. You still have some free time to join our trip. The traditional Thai house over there is our destination. We keep everything just as it was in the past. This boat is like a time machine that will bring you back in time to a hundred years ago. Please turn off your mobile phones when we get off the boat. Thanks. Just like when the plane is taking off. Do you like it? It's interesting. Mae is the owner of this house. It will be easy. -Welcome, Chanachol. -Thank you. We've prepared some traditional Thai snacks. These fish dumplings are truly exquisite examples of Thai cuisine. My grandmother used to work in the palace. Bengal quince juice for your refreshment served as hot or iced tea for your selection. Have you ever tried it, Chanachol? Never. Then... Mekhala... the gorgeous... goddess... Excuse me. ...seduces Ramasun... the giant god of thunder... by waving a crystal ball The crystal ball... The main hall in the middle is the original and the oldest one. That's my great grandfather in the largest picture frame. These ladies sitting in line are my great grandmothers. This is a photo of my mom and my dad. Men in the past lived privileged lives Right, Chanachol? They did. If you like native plants, we have a lot of them growing at the hill in the backyard. They have been here for ages. Please. Not today, I guess. Why not, Uncle Tim? I saw a snake. You have no luck today, guys. I really don't like snakes. But I'd love to. Boossaba and Ek will take you all to see the rest of our garden. I will take Chanachol to the hill in the backyard. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Do you actually dress like this everyday? Not everyday. Just occasionally. Rumor has it, people say that I'm not in my right mind. I've heard that you love old houses. -Do you like this house? -I do. What's that flower? It's called a peep flower. You probably wouldn't know it. It smells nice but unusual. We have lots of different native plants growing on this hill. Those are nom maew flowers. They're used in making desserts. Those are purple wreath and sarapi flowers. Do you know any of them? I've heard their names in Thai literature. Do you read Thai literature? My mom made me read it every summer when I was in England. Perhaps my mom didn't want her son becoming too westernized. She loved Thai culture. I hope that I can learn about Thai culture from you. Everyone is ready to leave. I say goodbye to you right here. What if I want to contact you? You can do it with Pakbhumi. -I will give you a call. -Right. Nice to meet you, Chanachol. Until we meet again. You. Are you here? Why are you here? Phot How did you know that I'm home? Your voice on the boat was so loud. Anyone could hear you. Mae, I bought this for you from Ayutthaya. Thanks. Let's talk outside, Phot. What are you doing? Sexually assaulting me? Take off your clothes. You want to do it or should I? I love it when you do it for me. The snake! The snake! The snake! The snake! What type of snake, Uncle Tim? A cobra. Why are you so obsessed with that snake, Mae? Phot I'm going to Bangkok. Can you give me a ride? Yeah. CHANACHOL MANSION BANGKOK - 10 PM Back in the cage again. Am I a prisoner in my own house? Do you like Mae's house? Later. -Let's see Kaew. -Okay. Daddy's home with Uncle Bhumi. -Hi, Petch. -How's my little girl? -Hello, Uncle Bhumi. -Why aren't you in bed? -I'm about to. -Good girl. Let me kiss you. -Go to bed. -Good night, Daddy and Uncle Bhumi. -Good night. -Good night, sleep tight. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. Hi, Kaew. -You're back. -What about you? I went to Frank's diamond showcase. Want a drink, Pakbhumi? No, thanks. I just wanted to say hi to you and then call it a day. Do you have plans? I'm going to a party in Thonglor. So I gotta go. Good night, bro. Good night, Kaew. Right. How's the old house in Suphan Buri? Do you like it? I do. But the owner will say no. Did you negotiate with the owner? Not yet. Thanks. What's that flower? It smells so nice. It's called a peep flower. MEKHALA'S HOUSE, BANGKOK 11 PM Mae. What? That stupid snake... Can I send my guys to kill it? I'm so sick of it. Leave her alone. I'm begging you. 12 AM You had a nightmare again? THE MYSTERIOUS LADY 1.30 PM I give up, Pakbhumi. I could hardly sleep last night. I had a blast last night. What are you thinking about the house? Should I invite Mae for dinner? You're free tonight and tomorrow night. John arrives in Phuket the day after tomorrow. We'll have a long meeting on Sunday. Our customers want a cultural trip to England in December. They want to visit museums in London during the day, and go to West End theaters at night. This is what you specialize in. Of course. I will do everything I can to make this the perfect trip. I need a break, guys. Hello. Good morning, Mae. What's up, my lovely boy? Chanachol'd like to invite you to have dinner with him tonight. What if I'm not available? You should be. A millionaire wants to treat you to dinner. Chanachol lets you pick the place you'd like to have dinner at. I should be the one who buys your boss dinner. I don't want anyone's charity. At my place. Just tell your boss Mekhala would like to invite him to have dinner. I'm the chef. If he can bring a couple of bottles of expensive wine, I would be grateful. Is that all right? Okay, see you. Pakbhumi. Is Mekhala married? She probably never will be. Why not? You'll know why when you know her. 7 PM After you. These are for you. Thank you. Please come in, Chanachol. No need to say that to Pakbhumi. He visits this place quite often. I'll put the wine in your pantry. Fine. Make yourself at home, Chanachol. A single girl's place is a mess. Please take a seat. What would you like to drink? Chanachol always prefers whisky on the rocks. A man after my own heart. You like whisky too? Are you surprised? Mae could finish that whole bottle. Really? If you saw how my friends and I used to drink in college, you would be shocked. Pakbhumi, can you get me a glass of wine, please. Yes, ma'am. Were they getting wasted? -Of course they were. -It depends... on your definition of "wasted". If they're still conscious and can see things around them, they're not totally wasted, right? You have a point. Wait. You're not getting a drink, Pakbhumi? I already have plans tonight. I just brought my boss here. Where are you going, Pakbhumi? I have a meeting at 8 PM. Really? Indeed. Please take care of my boss. I'm leaving now. Good night. Good night, bro. Then there were two of us... Does that frighten you? Why would I be frightened? Me, of course. I should be scared of myself. How so? I don't always know what to do when I'm with a stranger. I can now reveal that... CHU THAI PARTY, SUPHAN BURI - 8 PM ...for the upcoming election, my son, Phot, has confirmed his intention to run as candidate for the Chu Thai Party. -Hooray! -Hooray! -Hooray! -Hooray! -Hooray! -Hooray! I would prefer to be by a river than the sea, the mountains or a creek in the woods. Why? I love the repetitive movement of a river. Makes me feel warm and cozy. I think that rivers are alive. They have spirits. That's quite a strange belief to hold. “Strange” like me, right? PHOT Excuse me. Please. Hello. Can I see you tonight? How about tomorrow night? I have a guest tonight. Who's that? A woman or a man? That's a secret. See you tomorrow night, Phot. Right, tomorrow night it is. -Chai. -Yes. You go to Mekhala's house and kill that snake. People says it's a mystical serpent. Nobody dares to go to that house at night, young master. There's no such thing, you idiot. Go. You kill it tonight. Yes, young master. Did you make a reservation in Phuket for John? -I'll be there tonight. -Thanks a lot. 10.15 PM Pan, follow me to the president's office. Yes, Pakbhumi. About buying an old Thai house, have you made up your mind yet? There are some old Thai houses located on the riverside near my place. I can take you to meet the houses' owners. Do you want to try that? You might find one you like. Fine, if it's not too much bother. How about tomorrow? I have no plans. Where's that stupid snake? I think it's here. It's a girl. You're right. I see what you see. Be careful. Is that a girl or a ghost? How could a ghost have such lovely boobs? I can't stand it. I really can't stand it. No need to hide, girl. Pol. You go ahead. Sure. Where is she? Go away! Help me! I'm so clumsy tonight. -Let me help you. -No, don't. Ouch! Can I see it? It's just a small cut. It's all right. Your phone is ringing, Chanachol. Yes, dear. Petch has a fever and she's been throwing up. I called Doctor Krit. -He's here. Hi, Doctor. -Good evening. -This way. -Yes. -What are her symptoms? -She keeps vomiting. I have no idea what's wrong with her, doctor. You should hurry. I'm on my way right now. Mae, I really have to go. What's wrong? My daughter is sick. You should leave. Don't worry. I'm so sorry. We all have duties to carry out. I understand. This is my business card. I'll give you a call then. Yes. -Phot, I'm free tonight. -Okay, I'll be there right away. Hi, my little tiger. You're not going to bed? I wanted to see you, Dad. Good. Now you can stay up late. We'll be able to go clubbing soon. Not a good idea. I'm going back to Bangkok tonight. Where are you staying for the night? We better stay here. I don't want to travel tonight. -Yes, mom. -Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. 11 PM She's sleeping. What have I done? Become an adulterer? That's crazy. I'll stay with her tonight. Me too. THE SERPENT That's a relief. She just had food poisoning. Let her rest for a day and she'll be back to normal by tomorrow. -Thank you, Krit. -That's all right, bro. She's getting better. I'm leaving now. Why do I want to see her so badly? I want her, or do I want her house? 10 AM Oh. How's your daughter, Chanachol? She had food poisoning, but she's getting better. Did you forget about our appointment? How could I forget that? Can I pick you up at your place? Let's meet in Bang Plama. I'll send a boat to pick you up at the pier. You remember the route? I do. Let's meet around 11. See you. See you. Hello. What? Damn it. He was ordained? Right. Okay. Fine. I'll be there. Want some coffee, Phot? No, I'm going to my office and then to Bang Plama. I gotta go. Pakbhumi I won't be in my office today. Petch is sick. You can attend the meeting for me. Call me if you need anything. Okay, boss. About your dinner last night, how was it? Petch was sick so I had to leave. You poor thing. Don't worry about the meeting. I'll take care of it. Hope your daughter gets well soon. All right. Bye. Chanachol isn't coming? He can't make it, dad. -Where is he? -His daughter is sick. I see. Good for you. I know, Dad. Ponthip. Come to the president's office. 11 AM What's going on, Uncle Tim? Phot's men... They were killed by snakebites and fell into the water. They just found their bodies. Hey. You're so afraid of that snake you had to hide away here? It's really a ghost serpent. Ghosts are not real. Are you sure that you're not drunk? I saw you were pretty tipsy at the party. -You're lucky to be alive. -What? I guess I'll have to kill that fucking snake myself. Watch your language, sir. No need to say the "F" word. See? She's coming. Hey! Sir! You You killed them? Why did you kill them? 12 AM What's in your cigarette? It smells wonderful. It's made from dried peep flowers. They can be used as tobacco? Sure. Please take a seat. Thank you. Have we met before? Make yourself at home. Mekhala will be here in a minute. Right. Welcome back, Chanachol. I wish I could be a local here. Why? Like home is where the heart is? It's not like that. I think this place is so peaceful. I've never felt like this. When I'm in Bangkok, the city makes me stressed. It's different for me. I'm lively and active when I'm in Bangkok. This place is indeed peaceful. I love them both, I really do. Lucky you. Chanachol, watch out! The water is not that deep. You can stand up. You're not drowning. Don't be scared. Are you all right? It's okay. We're all right. Do you like wearing a sarong? I like it. It's oddly comfortable. You'll get used to it. Uncle, all my cigarettes are soaked. Can I try one of yours? Sure. Thank you. So you have to use Uncle Tim's cigarettes. Do you want a new packet? I could get someone to pick one up for you. Don't bother. I like these cigarettes. They smell really nice. I can't believe that you can't swim. Your name means "defeating the water". My dad told me that when I was young, I was about two or three years old, I almost drowned. So my parents changed my name from Pinit to Chanachol for good luck. So, we couldn't see any old Thai houses. We can do it in the evening. I don't think so. Why not? Scared of a boat ride? No, I'm not. I just now feel like I don't want to buy any Thai houses. When I came here, you might think that I'm crazy but I've always wanted to be here. I want to sit right here as long as I can. It's so peaceful. You know, I want to lie down right here. -I couldn't sleep last night. -Please do. Make yourself at home. -Get a good sleep. -Yes. I will imagine that this house belongs to me. I want to see daddy! I want to see daddy! I'm going to meet him. It's all right, my baby. Daddy is working. I want to see daddy. I want to see daddy. I believe that we will be able to make profits of more than a billion Baht within this quarter. Excuse me. It's from the president. -Hi. -Pakbhumi? May I speak to Chanachol? What? He's not with... He's in the restroom right now. He said he has an upset stomach. I'll tell him to call you back right away. How's Petch? She's getting much better. She had food poisoning. She wants to talk to her daddy. I'll tell him to call you back as soon as possible. Maybe in the evening because right now we're in the middle of the meeting. Is that all right, Kaew? all right. What's up, my lovely bro? Hi, Boos. Is Mae in your office? She's not in the office. She might be in Bang Plama this afternoon. Do you need anything? That's all right. Fine. I'll give her a call later. Miss you. Okay. Right. Bye. Chanachol called you? No, it's Kaew. He's not with her right now. Where is he? He's probably in Suphan Buri at Mae's place. He has had an awakening, dad. Good. 5.45 PM The river is calling. The river is calling me. How can I go to her? I can't swim. Hello, my lovely Shaba. Oh. Is my boss with Mae? 8.05 PM I miss you so badly. I'm on my way to see you now. Come and pick me up at the pier. See you in an hour. Okay. I'll be there. Right. Hi, Kaew. Pakbhumi, it's me. Now, we're heading to Pattaya. John's arrived early so he has to go to Pattaya right now. Oh. He's in John's car. His phone's battery must be dead. When we arrive Pattaya, I'll tell him to call you back right way. Is that all right, Kaew? I think the party is over. I don't want to leave. I want to stay over then go back in the morning. Is that a good idea? What do you mean? You have a wife. It doesn't matter. It does. Trust me. Please. Just one night. I promise. If it's okay with you, I can stay on the veranda. That's not a good idea. Why not? You're not familiar with the countryside. At nighttime there will be insects and nocturnal animals. You'll be bothered by them. That's nothing to me. When I was in England, I used to go camping in the woods. It was great. 9.20 PM Sorry to make you wait. I can wait for you. Where's my boss? He's staying over for the night. Perfect. A lantern. I'll put it right here so the light won't disturb you. When you go to bed, tuck the net in properly. Well, How can I tuck the net in? Like this. Oh. I see. Daddy's been bitten. A snake bit him. BANG PLAMA RESORT, SUPHAN BURI 10.05 PM MAI KAEW Hello. Hello, Pakbhumi. Is that you, Kaew? He's in the exclusive lounge with John. Can you pack some clothes for him? He has to stay in Phuket for two days. He will get them at your place in the morning. Pakbhumi. 11 PM Who's that child? Who's that guy and those three women? I need to find the answer. You. You're here. Why are you here? Don't worry about me. I promise you I will be a good girl. Go away! Go away! No! Don't! Go away! Get out of here. How can you keep a huge snake? It's dangerous. No, she's not my pet. Not your pet? Then why don't you kill it or let someone catch it? I think you should go back. Go change your clothes. I'll ask Uncle Tim to take you to the pier. I'm not going anywhere until I know about you and that bloody snake. Please go back. I'm begging you. You don't belong here. That's not true. This place belongs to me. I think that you should take that snake somewhere else or... give it to a zoo. She's not gonna hurt me. Snakes are wild animals. It could cost you your life someday. That will never happen. What makes you so confident? Because she's not an animal. If it's not an animal, what is it then? I have no idea what she is. I just know that my mom called her "You". The first time I met You I was around six or seven years old. That night, my dad brought a girl home and had sex with her while my mom was in the house. Kosum! -Kosum! -He kept doing that. Don't be scared, my baby. She'll take care of you for me. Please call her "You". Hello to You. Since then, I've met her quite often in our house or at the hill. Back then I still thought You was my mom's pet snake. When my mom took me to a boarding school in Bangkok, that was the first time that I didn't see You for a long period of time. When my mom and dad died in a mysterious accident, I was in high school. I came back for my parents' funeral. I thought I'd have a chance to see You. But You had gone without a trace. I can remember the day that You came back. It was the summer break of my first year in college. That was the first time I experienced sexual intercourse. That evening, I went home like I always did at every summer break. I was so proud and happy to be a real woman. Even though we hadn't met for ten years, I knew right away that it was You. The way You looked at me is like a guardian who has been waiting for me who misbehaved, so she can condemn and reprove me with her love and kindness. Now you know my secret. You can call me a weirdo like everyone else. Don't you know that I'm a weirdo too. Just like you. Actually, I have no idea who I really am. I was an orphan, adopted by my new parents. They didn't have a kid. I still hold on to the hope that one day I will be able to meet my real parents, my dad and my mom... Just once. Someday you will meet them. I believe that you will. Boo. One more time, okay? No, I can't. You've already had two. Come on. I'll do the work. PONTHIP Hello. The meeting in Phuket is cancelled. Mr. John is sick so he will set it for another date. Okay. LOVE SICK 6.30 AM Good morning, Uncle. If you take a walk in this area, beware of snakes. I met her last night. I'll take it as a good sign for encountering You. You are so lucky. Take this sword. Carry it when you're in this area. You'll be safe. You make it sound like a magic sword in a superhero movie. You could say so. Hold it. I have found my answer. This is it. The place I've always searched for, it's here in Bang Plama with Mekhala. Those are sai yud flowers. Their sweet scent is so strong early in the morning. The scent is fleeting but it still smells nice. Mae... right now I don't really know the way you feel about me. I just want you to know that my feeling for you is real. I love you. No! Don't! No! Don't! You need to get of here right now, Uncle Tim. Please take him to the pier. -Let's go. -She's hurt. -She's gonna make it. -Nonsense, Mae. You have to trust me. If she wanted to kill you, you would be dead by now. You attacked her. She'll be after you. Have you ever heard about a mad cobra's grudge? Never. You can't go back there. I will. Your magic sword saved my life once. Don't underestimate her. Pakbhumi, you came here to pick me up? I have good news. The meeting in Phuket is cancelled. John is sick. How about you? Have fun last night? Your daughter is perfectly well. Thanks a lot, bro. 10 AM How are you, my baby? -Daddy is back. -Are you well? She's getting much better. She can go to school tomorrow. -I had a bad dream last night. -Yeah? Tell me about it. What was your nightmare? You were bitten by a giant snake in my dream. I cried a lot. Really? Don't worry. Don't you know that I have a magic sword to fight off snakes with? Daddy, you're the best. Daddy has to go now or he'll miss his flight. I packed your suitcase. Thanks. Where are you going this time? I have a meeting with some foreign businessmen in Phuket. Do you want anything? I want a magic sword to fight a snake with. Okay, I'll get one for you. Are you all right? You must be exhausted after last night. Even Pakbhumi sounded like he was out of breath. John made me drink a lot so I passed out. Your phone's battery was dead too? Yeah. Are there peep flowers in Pattaya? What is this? Smells so nice. It's called sai yud. What's this stain on your pants? I might have fallen when I was drunk. I told Sman to drive you to the airport. No. I'll drive to the airport so I can get home early after the meeting is done. I'm leaving. You forgot your suitcase. Thanks. Good morning. Where have you been all night? I stayed over in Bang Plama. I've been waiting for you since 1 AM. I missed you so badly. No, Phot. I have to go work. You should do the same thing. Fuck work. You and me, we are both owners of companies. Who would dare to say a word if we were late for work? Get out of my house. You tell me to go away? Get out of my house now. Mae... Are you seeing someone else? Yes, I am. What's the big deal! I have always had someone else since we've been in a relationship. We both know that, Phot. And you already have a wife and a kid. So you have no right to claim me. Please remember that. If you have someone else, -I will kill you. -You can't kill me, Phot. Just like your men can't kill that snake at my place. You'll see that I can kill that stupid snake. If I can do it, you'll be next. 1 PM Hi, Dad. Chanachol is not coming today? Yes, dad. Is he with that girl, Mekhala? Exactly. Mai Kaew needs to know about this. Why? It's time they got divorced. Is that a good idea? It must be. Can you tell me that you love me, Mekhala? Chanachol, you act like a teenage boy. You're not going to Phuket? It's definitely because of me. No, it's not. They cancelled the meeting. That's why I'm here. I want to hang out with you. Make yourself at home. There's no snake to bother you here. 2 PM YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MEKHALA PLABPLA MISS MEKHALA PLABPLA AGE 33 YEARS OLD Pakbhumi, is that you? How's the business in Phuket? Is Chanachol busy right now? It's me, Kaew. Chanachol is not in Phuket. John is sick. He's still in Australia right now. We didn't go to Pattaya yesterday. Chanachol made Pakbhumi tell you that. If he didn't order it, no one would dare to lie to you. Pakbhumi is with me now. Right, See you. Thanks, Dad. You fucking snake! Where are you? Come out! You, let him go. He's dead. Mae, you have a guest. Sorry, I'm quite late. No. I'm so late. I'm Mekhala. Can I help you? I'm Chanachol's wife. You had sex with him, didn't you? I did. You're such a whore. Having an affair with my man. Leave him alone. Gold digger. Mae, Uncle Tim called and told me that Phot has died from snakebites. 3 PM I warned him many times but he never listened to me. You are the only woman that Phot loved. He must be happy that you have come to see him. Thank you very much. Please cleanse his body. Who are you? I'm his friend. Your dad was my best friend. That woman is gorgeous and smart. But she is such a whore, always messing with married men. She has ruined so many couples. I think that you should think it over. I've made my mind up, Uncle. I want a divorce. You should talk to him first. Where can I meet him, Uncle? Pakbhumi do you know where Chanachol is? I think I do. I am a true sinner, Boos. I must be sent to hell when I die. That's not true, Mae. Where's our group tour going tomorrow? To China, Xi'an airport. I'll be in charge of that group. 5 PM Kosum! Kosum! Are you crazy? -Kosum! -Let me go! What's wrong with you? Cherd, let me go. Get out of my house. All of you, go away! Cherd... 6 PM Keep in mind, Pakbhumi, that everything I've done, it's all for you. I know, Dad. Excuse me, -can you take me to Mekhala's? -Sure. You shouldn't be here. She's not home. I'm not here for Mae. I'm here for you. Thirty years ago... 7.30 PM ...at this house was there a little boy who lived here? Why do you ask? I had a dream about that boy. I saw his parents. I saw Mae's parents and I saw you. What was that dream? It's really weird. I saw that boy's mother was having an affair with Mae's father. So that boy's family had to leave this house. But... the boat sank. That boy... drowned. That boy's mom was named Tome. She was my only sister. My nephew's name was Daeng. He was so adorable. He shouldn't have died. Uncle, I believe that boy, Daeng, your nephew, is not dead. How do you know? They haven't found his body yet. That's because I-- Chanachol, you shouldn't be here. Uncle Tim, please take him back to the pier. -Mae, calm down and hear me out. -No. You have to leave. Did Uncle Tim tell you that my friend was bitten to death by You this afternoon. You must leave, trust me. Calm down, Mae. I know what calls me to this house. I know who am I, Mae. I think I'm Daeng, Uncle Tim's nephew who drowned. What are you talking about? I've never hear anything about that. I saw it in my dream. It's just a dream, you can't take it seriously. You saw the pictures of my dad and my mom. You see this house, you see Uncle Tim. You've made up a story in your head. I can't believe it, you're obsessed. Are you calling me crazy? I think you... have an overactive imagination. -Just like you and that snake. -You need to leave. I've made up my mind. About what? No! Don't! You, I'm begging you. Please don't take his life. I love him. Like you love me. If you want to kill him, please kill me as well. You, please forgive me. 10.30 PM TW 4070 BANGKOK I will rent a boat and take you to her house. No need for that. Are you sure? You know what, Pakbhumi? He hasn't had sex with me for six months. That woman, she's really gorgeous. You are gorgeous too. Really? Really. If so, kiss me. Is that a good idea? My life... will never be happy. It will. It definitely will. DISCOVERY 4.30 AM Sweet music. Isn't it sad? Sweet music... always makes you sad. Goodbye. No goodbye. I'm sure we will meet again. Mae, you need to go now. I've got to go. Please keep in mind, you're my first love and my only love. Right. I will. I'm leaving. I feel like my heart has been ripped out. She might not come back to me ever again. I can believe it. 7.30 AM -The kid is safe. -What about his parents? They drowned. Take the kid to a hospital. Oh, he's so cute. There's no way you can make that kid your heir! Sending him to study in England is already more than enough. I've made up my mind, Direk. 9 AM Uncle... I'm pretty sure I'm Daeng, your nephew who drowned in the river. I want to give you my respect as a member of my real family. This house is cursed. It's a house of sinners. You should stay away from this place. Please call me Daeng, Uncle. Sure. Daeng, my boy. My mom and my dad, they were killed by You, weren't they? She held a grudge against anyone who hurt Kosum. What about Kosum? How did she die? Please take care of Mekhala for me, Uncle Tim. Yes, ma'am. I'm ready to go with You. Please take care of Mekhala for me. I can't believe that everything that happened here is true. If you believe that it's true, then it is. If you don't believe that it's true then it's not. I believe that it's true. If you think so, don't come back. Please go. I'll take you to the pier. That's okay, Uncle. I'll take a boat. Can you do that? I'm Daeng, your nephew, aren't I? I feel like I'm finally free from everything. My body feels so light, like it's weightless. The world seems to move slower. I think this is it, the freedom that I've always wanted. You, I'm ready to leave. Please take me away from this crazy world. Right now, I need some peace. 9.30 AM TWO YEARS LATER 3 PM This boat is a time machine that will bring you back in time to a hundred years ago. Please turn off your mobile phone when we get off the boat. Thanks. Just like when the plane is taking off. What's up? Hi, Mae. The president has come a long way to visit my house. Mae, this is Ekkabhop. He's my new business partner. Ekkabhop, this is Mae, the owner of this house. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Please. Subtitle translation by Chutarat Banthakit
