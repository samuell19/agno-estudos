THE SECRET Shit! It will be too late to do it. You say that every time. I'm coming with you. MEDICAL SECTOR Calm down my birds, easy. Heading for Paris? 30 minutes and we're there. You mean we're that close to Paris? - You say, you don't know where you are? - Who is there? - David - Who? - David! It's you! - Are you alone? - Yes. Why? Were you with somebody? - He didn't come upstairs. You can't be spying at 5 in morning? You are really in some condition. Two weeks ago we were to had a dinner together. I waited for hours. Coffee? I feel there is something wrong. Serious? What are those marks? You really are a strange man. I run to you once, you spent a night, and that's it. Two weeks after that... You maybe crazy. But why trust me? Nobody knows that we know each other. I won't put you in danger. Anyway I hope not. Could you lent me little money? - Surely you have more than me. I musn't go home or be seen at the Bank. And if I write you a cheque, you'll be spotted. I won't be able to refund it - That's ok with me. I will think about you when I eat potatoes for the next month. Want to ge some sleep? - Just for a while. And then I must be going. And remember: You never saw me before. Are you afraid of me? I know I am. This things could have happened to anybody. Happened at any time. What things, David? David? David? Tell me about it. You are looking for me? I ask you because I am the only one here. I didn't know about that. Any sheepfold up there? No sheepfold around here. - No? No. All the pens collapsed beginning of winter. Excuse me. I'll start back down It's a strange idea coming here, out of season. I like being alone. Me too. Julia! Julia! My Julia! We have a dinner guest. Who is it? - A man. - What man? - I don't know the man. But he looks sad. Thanks for the stone. It will freeze soon, it's winter. It's safer to stay at our place overnight. My name is Thomas Berthelot. I live here all year. I am sorry for what happened earlier. I always worry that the next person will be a tourist. Do you think I look like a tourist? -Absolutely not. Come in. Good lord, what do you have in that thing? - Canned food. Get comfortable at the fire. My name is Julia. What's yours? Sardines in oil ... Liver Pate ..! You really live dangerously! He was on his way to pen. Want something to drink? A little wine. My wife is very pretty. You have noticed that too. I knew you would. She loves stones. Slate, sandstone, granite. Serpentine especially. That's a green marble. Crazy about them. Must be an owl. You will get used to that. At first I was afraid too. At night, only a little noise, and I'd be terrefied. Is it really necessary? -Just swallow. To hear her is to obey her. Do you live alone on the plateau? Certainly. Nobody ever comes here? Only in the summer. There it goes again. I'll better refuel it. You know, if you want to... You can stay here for a few days. We have a room. No one will bother you. - I think it's better if I go. - No. No! I am preparing a dinner. Glazed Roast Pork in fresh blueberry sauce. How about that? What is it? Don't you feel well? The best thing would be if he was found out after an accident. Victims of car accidents can remain unknown. There's many of them. He's scared. You seen his eyes, haven't you? -Not much. You see badly. I can see a great deal and I mean it. I might even mention, that knowing this man... ...could be an adventure. What do you mean? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, but you're hoping. Does it please you? I think you are geting bored. -You know what this is for? I know. You like to take chances. Why don't you get dressed up more often? You were the one with strange eyes tonight. Hello! -Good Morning, Red. How are you this morning? He'll be going? -He'll be going round the mountain... Did you sleep well? There! - Where? Ridiculous. Do you want milk in your coffee? - No. You're right. Coffee with milk tear you guts out. They didn't see you. - No, they couldn't see anybody. Too much of a hurry. No, let me fix it. I make the best toasts in all Europe. The butter is local, with special nutty taste. Delicious! You're sure, you are the one they hunting? They don't look for a man using a helicopter. If it isn't a case that is... special. Have a little of our jam? -No.-You'll live to regret it. Thanks very much. If you are in any danger ... that why not stay here? A man who wants to hide, feels more safe in a big city, only if he has a cash or... somebody to help him. I must say that I don't. Did you do something awful? - I have done nothing. Then it's alright. Stay here and you could help me. I don't know if I can. -That's very true. -What's your name? My name is David. -David. No. Stay with him. Or he could start suspect us for leaving him alone. Alright. And suppouse I'm attacked? It would ba a case of inviting him. I shall know it and beat you, naturally. I think I might like that. No, stay. Why did you stay? Thomas figured you needed a hostage. So you won't be upset. No. He left you behind to make me talk. You're wrong about that. Thomas does not ask questions. He knows it all. He was born that way. Do you have any friends in a neighborhood? No. We left everything in Paris, ...including them. -But why? Some bad memories, that we forgetting. And you? You live here all year long? Do you always answer question with a question? - Good morning, gentlemen. Everything alright? Excuse me, sir. Yes? When I was watching over my sheep, I've seen this person yesterday. He was heading in your direction. He didn't look too respectable. My wife and I did not see anybody about. How much do I owe you? - You read all this? No. just look at the pictures. It substitues the television. They are more puritanical. Agricultural ants, wrongly called seeders. Do not confuse with neighbor, known as, the Mexican Barbatus. I remember seeing a nest walking in spring, on the outskirts of New Orleans. They were swarming, their purpose clear in that verdant setting. Clearing whole areas of air around them. That's Thomas. He writes them. Stories of animals. Or real ones. Not that nonsense, where animals are ridiculous men. It's scary, isn't it? It's my drawing. - It's like a war machines. He must have bought a roast beef. Red meat always make him feel like a savage. Is it a weapon you are trying to find? Yes. Would you feel safer when you find one? -Yes. It used to be here. Thomas must have taken it with him. Do you do that often? First time. You know, ever since you're here, Thomas is not the same. Why do you say that? Do you want me to go? I didn't say that. Where is he? -At the house. Someone saw him slipping past the village. I was asked if I had seen him. What did you say? - Do you think he's dangerous? - Yes, I do. What are we going to do? - Going to give him a hand. But ... Aren't you afraid? -No, I'm too fat. Did you hear what I said? So, anytime you want to. The egges, thank you. The man who saw me, was he a policeman? No. A sheep herder. Around here, the locals don't talk much to the police. Many of these helicopters pass you? No. -First time. You begining to scare me. I think David would be more relaxed if you gave him your gun. I always smoke beyond my means. - Did you hear what I said? - Yes. Well? He has it already. -Is that right? Give it back. - No Please, I want it. It is of use to me. I will not get caught alive. Are you a spy? - No, absolutely not. By chance, I came across... a secret. It is a thing nobody has the right to know. What thing? I'll be going. If you know where to go, and if it's more secure than here, then you should. They will finish you too. They'll think I told about it. David! You have got no chance alone. Does this mean you don't trust us? If you reach the sheep pens, what then? -I gain time. Thomas! For you there is a chance, but a slim one. You have to kill me. Say you were forced to, when I went mad. You idiot. There are ways to escape. Come on. Let's try the other side! -They are everywhere. I guess you're right. What we are going to do? -How do I know? We'll see. No. You stay here! Yes sir. We got "go ahead". Fire at will! I can't believe it. What is going on here? Are you all crazy or what? Who is in command? The war is over! The war finished! Don't you know that?! Listen to me! You are all mad crazy! Cease fire! Those are only the manouvers! Well, go play somewhere elese! What are you doing here? You raise hell in my land. I live here! This land has been requisitioned for a military use! -It hasn't come to court, nor it was approved. Until it does, it happen to be my place! Understand? Get out of here! Why? Why did you frighten us so much? What do you think of David? Physically, I mean. I'm afraid of him. Yes, very scared of him. PSYCHIATRIC CENTER You are afraid also at night? Not so good. I ran away just three days ago. From where? -I don't know. I don't know the place. It was like a prison in an old fort. Would they publish your photo? - No. In case ever this came to light, they are everywhere, see everything hear everything, know everything, they had quickly hide everything they want. Everything! Shit! But ... ...who's they? Don't make me into a mad fool. They tortured you? They wanted to know exactly what I knew about it. And if I had mentioned it to someone. And then? Nothing. But ... As bad as that? If they get me, I am in it for again. It's not different than the hell you were in. No different. The terrible thing, in their place, I would do the same. You would? Let's say, if you save the whole country. but kill one guy, how would you feel? I don't know. It is a matter of conscience. Don't know. But, why you wanna go abroad? I'll manage to live a few days more. There is always a hope that I can escape. You live for that? I think that there is only a little bit of chance ... Hardly any. Not very much. Hey ... Do you believe what I tell you? Why not? Why not?! Because ... I'm being changed. - Changed, how? I mean, changed as a man. The whole atmosphere is changing! You live in misery, I live in happiness. Maybe we mixed them two, we could really have something! Might work. Might work. I'll be leaving tomorrow.. -No, you will not be going. We'll all be going. Julia ... you ... and me! The three of us! Not drunk and together... we can do anything! It will work out. Come on red hair! If you not asleep, wake up! Here, I am sure you will want some. It's milk, I don't want any. This milk tastes like a grassy meadow. I am drinking pretty daisies and four-leaf clovers. Thomas ... Let him go away. Tomorrow we will take him to Mimizan. We'll be alright there. Then, we will sail him in the boat to Spain. Who is we? It is too dangerous. You like him. -What's the matter? If you go with him, I'll stay here. No. Yes. Alright. Thomas ... ...let him go. -Listen, I think he's telling the truth. It's too late Did you kill anyone? Yes. A guard. Does Thomas know? No. You might as well tell him. What if he's crazy? -What if he's not? We have to trust him. In any case, there is nobody to help us. There is my brother. -A journalist! You must realize if David told us the truth, your brother would also be in danger. I have the feeling that ... I will never come back here. It's not bad, being here, the three of us on a day like this. I shouldn't be living with Julia, she's has got better things to do. You ought to be dead... and me too. Why you? Doctors make errors too. I had some bad luck, but then I met Julia, and it's very much different now. Look out there! Behind us! If they stop us,will you shoot them? If I turn around, they'll spot us. Go out the back, across the bend of the river, circle the road block and we pick you up. It's the best for us. And go quickly, we mustn't stay here. And take your bag. They'll inspect us. I hope he has confidence in us. He may run away and not rejoin us. And so? Say we don't stop for him? Police, sir. Your registration papers please. Do you have the registration? Your driver's license, please. Thank you. Ma'am, what are you carring in the back? -Only our luggage. We're are on vacation. Would you mind opening the back, please? All right. Why have you stopped before the roadblock? It overheats itself out. The fan belt isn't tight enough.. Ok. Thank you. You know your front tyre is worn? -I will get it changed. Can you tell us why the roadblock? -Don't you listen to the radio? We are looking for a lunatic, who escaped from a psychiatric clinic in Toulouse. We'll get him shortly. Don't worry about it. It's not him. Why you crying? There is no way out of this situation. If he is crazy, he'll kill us. If he is not, they kill him. Thomas ... please, I know I'm right. Leave him on the road. You must do it. No. Why? Because he is a friend. But you don't know him. -I don't have to know him, Julia! I'll save you. -What do you mean? It's really nothing. There. I was afraid you were leaving me there. They are looking for an escaped lunatic from an asylum. Ah, well. I am not the one they want. Where have you been? -Look at this. The mentally ill from Toulouse still on the run. You can stay quiet, now. I am going to drive now. -If you want. Is your boat in shape? -Panda? It is a solid boat, but not speedy. it's not bad for its age. Isn't it Julia? It is an old fishing boat. Here. -That's enough. A little bit? -No! Show him the photo of this lunatic. Anything wrong? I know him. He's one of them who questioned me. Questioned you? This picture is the excues for putting the road blocks. It's a classic tric. It's me they looking for. he has the usual paranoia symptoms He hardly shows any confusion, his mentality is ordinary But when he think he is being threatened, like he recently felt, he can easily kill. Thank you, doctor. We can safely say that all forces are after Fran?ois Gui?tou, the escaped psychopath ... Look to the rear! How long has he been following us? A while now, but wanted to make sure. Speed up, speed up! I noticed this car stopped on the shoulder. Slow down. Slower. They not after us. I am stupid. Turn around. - No, not here! They are not following us. They can send a patrol here. They have several cars. They have maps of each sector. -It is not the Normandy landing! At the next crossroads they will setup a roadblock. - You're not just having a nightmare? Tell me what the hell we are doing? We do not know who he really is! We don't know who we are protecting him from? Let me out here. -No! You stay here. There is nothing really to cry about, red head. It's fatigue and we got it too. Who is we? -David and me. David and you, you and David! It's all I hear. Let me out here. It's all my fault. No,it's not about you. What is it about? Nothing! Absoultely nothing. There aren't many people, who would want to live here in winter. As you can see the pines are bound to look the same. And it's just rain, the silence ... Surely there would be a forester living here, or people who collect resin. - When do we go? -As soon as the tide comes in. And when we reach Spain? -That wouldn't be a problem. I know some good men in Spain. Basques. A few years ago I happened to dabble into politics. Well, there she is. Hello Mr. Bertram. Glad to see you. How are you? Alright. Alright. Miss! A Cinzanno, please. I came as fast as I could. Thank you for coming. -You did this morning's editorial? - Your beer, Mr. Bertram. - No, no This is serious. -Go ahead. You have met my sister Julia, she lives with a writer, in the middle of nowhere. I received this letter. Carcassonne. May I read it? Yes. found in his clothing an identity card that wasn't his ... It was in the name of Desir? Lepage, hospital nurse. He calls himself David. He is about 35 years. Brown hair. Quite thin. Thomas seems to be bewitched by him. And I am scared. Make some discreet inquiries. If it's true what he says, we are in danger. But perhaps he is only a mental case. Write to me to post office in Mimizan. What a story! The biggest one I have ever got. There! The line is going to break! Help! Give me a hand! It's enormous! Quick! Hurry up the line is going to break! It's a long time since I feel so good. Tomorrow morning... We will go to see see a guy in Mimizan. A professional smuggler. I have no money to pay. - It doesn't matter. He owes me a large favour. Barbecue sauce and lots of onions! Do you see that? -Yes, I do. It's a real monster. Did you see us bringing in? -I did. He soaked completely, he needs to change. -I see. Fuck! No way! They are all flat. Someone was here and slashed them. Julia! Did you see anybody? Why didn't they kill us? When you pretend... -They wanted us stuck here. They are watching us, I'm sure. They are waiting for their orders. I will hide the car. Hold it! Better not touch that. If they had put a trap, they wouldn't have punctured the tires. Thomas! Thomas... we need walk back. hitchhike to the car agency in Mimizan, rent a car ... and come back here with four tyres. It is the only solution, isn't it? You would be upset red head? Could be back in the morning. Desir? Lepage was a nurse in a psychiatric hospital. He was strangled by a patient who escaped. You'll see it matches the description of your sister. This is his file from Hospital Records.. David Daguerre, 36, height:1.70 cm., 68 kg of weight ... Is he really dangerous? - Dr. Pelletier will explain. The patient in question... is particularly persuasive ... He's intelligent ... and his magination never goes beyond a limit of reasonable thought. His behavior hardly shows any confusion. His mentality is ordinary. Until the day he think he is being threatened, then he can kill easily. This is the reason why the matter was not communicated to the press. Is he really been a journalist? He pretends to be a journalist, or a diplomat or even ... a secret agent force. Always on the run, always prosecuted, always keeping important secrets. What do I do? -Nothing. We will proceed immediately in a discreet matter. To ensure the safety of your sister and her husband. Have you told anyone else about this letter? No. But I would answer it promptly. No, you mustn't. She could get too scared. It is better to keep it silent after all. You will speak to her later about it. After. I heard some noise. It's in your head. You have to sleep. Would you make love to me despite Thomas? Afterall, we may all be dead tomorrow. Shut up. Tell me what you know. You might as well, if we are all going to be dead. What is it that you learnt? You know nothing! You're crazy. You invented everything. What about the flat tire? Did I invent them, too? Julia! Julia! Nothing happened. Do you want some rest? No, I'll be alright. I'll rest when the tyres are repaired. Thomas, don't you think it would be better if I went? Are you sure you wanna go? -It's better if it's not always you. And David can't go at all. I gotta be honest, I couldn't be able to shoot anyone with this thing. It hasn't been fired. It really wouldn't be much good. What's that for? You want to be spotted? They already spotted us. Might be better that way. Bring some bread. And some cigars and wine if you see it. Is that all? Why? Last night, Julia and i slept together. It's normal. It's not unusual. You are a woman that he would've wanted it. Is it all you got to say to me? I can't believe it. You were here alone. And she's unhappy. It's my fault. Yeah, this time, it's your fault. Hold on please. Hello? Claude Vandal, please. Who's calling? -His sister Julia. Good day, It's Lucien. He's not here at the moment. Has he gone out? We haven't seen him since this morning. We gotta press tonight. Ah so. Goodbye, thanks. How much? -1 unit, 7 francs. Are they ready? -Right here. Sick person did it. I'll go speak to him. -No! You want to get killed? David! Don't shoot him! Don't do it! David, there he is! It is for the resin. He is a forester. He really was a forester. A forester? Of course, there is always a forester. Or a mechanic, or a petrol station attendent. After all, nobody forces the Police to look like the Police. It's too easy for us. Do you understand? Alright, look... Am I right? You are in your house, the mailman rings... but i's no mailman at all. A cop. Thomas! I heard shots! Who's shooting? Don't worry. It was me. Nobody could help it. If I had a gun, I would shoot too. Why? It was somebody sent over to watch us. Was he alone? Armed? No? No. It means nothing. Since he spotted us, he could talk. But it can't be possible. Where is he? We must get out. You and I. Why we stuck in with him? You are crazy as much as he is. I am not dumping him. Tomorrow one of us he is going to die. Look at this guy. You think those hands could have spy for the police? Look at his hands, Thomas! And when the tyres were punctured? It was me. Why? To separate you both. To make him run. I meant to save you! You still don't understand anything? I made up the story about car following us. You won't believe it? -You should've told me when you did it. And the forester? Did I invent that too? Listen ... Don't you understand? If they get him, and he's with us, we are accomplices of murder. That's right. I am one, no matter what. You're scared, so the best thing is to leave for Paris. Go to Paris, I'll stay. I'll join you a bit later. Hey red head. Come on. Go, go ahead. Go! Go! Go! She is crazy. Where is she going? She is going to see the smuggler I told you about. Why lie to me? This is 425. She's is leaving the post office. We follow. I'll give you the details of a car to check. Mehari 626-NL40 ...to he day he feels threathend and kills. Be very cautious, both of you. Thomas! Thomas. Where were you? Get in! We are leaving right away. Where is the gun? Why did you have to do that? I haven't done anything. The gun. No. It is only for me. They mustn't take me alive. -Do as he says. Hand it to me Julia. Or shoot it. No. What did you do it for, red head? He was very crazy! He was! He was very sick too. And he was a murder. I've done an investigation to find out. My brother found it out. Then they know where to spot us. There was not a grain of truth in his story. It's all finished now. It's all over now. The nightmare is finished! Yeah, yeah. Calm down, calm down. All over, red hair. You know he would've kill us. He would've kill us some time or another. He already strangled a guard when he escaped. Yes, I understand ... It's alright. But you know that, he wanted to die rather than be taken alive. I understand. BEFORE COMITTING SUICIDE, THE MADMAN KILLED A COUPLE USING THEIR OWN REVOLVER. To protect itself, contemporary society starts machines rolling that it can no longer control. Julia's brother knew nothing really yet he knew too much. And so the trap was closed on him as well. english subs: rollingpeople
