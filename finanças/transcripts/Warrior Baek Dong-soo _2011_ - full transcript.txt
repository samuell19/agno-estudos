-=Episode 9=- All of you are dead meat today. Close the doors! Do you really want to battle it out with me? Wait... Yeo Un, dealing with them one-by-one is too troublesome. Let's do it together! Attack! Stop! Commander! They're new faces that we haven't seen even once within the two months after the Cho Si. (Cho Si - preliminary round of the civil service exam) How can they be allowed to join us when the training has almost ended? -=Jik Bu In: Sons or disciples of scholar-officials who are exempted from Cho Si during Imperial Examination years.=- They are Jik Bu In exempted from the Cho Si. I am a Jik Bu In too, but didn't I attend training with the rest of the Cho Si qualifiers? -=Hong Sa Hae=- This is clearly an unfair decision. Although there were no issues with respect to the procedures, what you have just mentioned makes sense. As for the three of them, I'll discuss the issue with the rest of the commanders and will announce the verdict on the Cho Si Trainees' Board. You are dismissed! Is this the lady? Yes. My greetings. I heard you're a pre-ordained samini. -=Samini: A novice nun before been accepted as a fully ordained female monk=- -=Bang Nyeon: ladies about 20 years old.=- I am still a bang nyeon, you don't have to use my honorific title. Please come in. So that means to say, you're a descendant of Yu Sang Do? Yes. Yu... Yu... Yu Sang Do, Yu Sang Do? -=Hyo Myo - King Hyojong=- Are you referring to the same Yu Sang Do who served with Hyo Myo? How can that kid not know about this. Aish, looks like he's lucky! You don't even know this, how would Dong Su know? Yes, yes. -=Sword Saint Gim Gwang Taek (Joseon's best Swordman)=- If His Royal Highness sent you here, seems like you are in some kind of danger. Are you fine? I have been living in danger all my life. Although I am capable of protecting myself, doing so now will put His Royal Highness in danger. That is why I am here now. I'm truly sorry. Take good care of her. Yes, Hyeongnim. (Hyeongnim - Respected Older Brother) Seriously! What a real pity! Why does she have to enter the temple? One look and I know that she's the better half of our trouble-maker Dong Su. Aish, what a waste! Commander, isn't this too biased? -=Goyukjichaek: a strategy whereby a person cause grievous hurt to his own body in order to bluff the other party.=- This is a goyukjichaek. Moreover, aren't the ones protesting the eldest son and nephew of the Minister Of Military Affairs? It wouldn't do the three of them any good if this matter blows up. Why must the three of you get into trouble the moment you enter the palace? However, isn't hopae technique not included in the course of Jangyongwi? When did you learn that? That... I didn't learn it formally. I only took a few peeks. A few peeks? Yes. I saw Sword Saint uncle practicing before. You took a few peeks and managed to learn the hopae technique. Ah, because I'm someone who learns quickly after being taught the basics, genius among geniuses! Take your leave. - Yes. - Yes. Why do you look at him like that? Dong Su said he learned the hopae technique after taking a few peeks. Only those who are extremely talented in martial arts are capable of doing that. Furthermore, to master that hopae technique, it took me an entire year. What? The deployment of the Cho Si trainees are done according to the rankings of the results. All of you should know this. Those who got the highest grade would be the Crown Prince's bodyguards. The second highest grade would be palace guards. The lower grade would be weaponry blacksmiths and the lowest grade will be deployed as beacon guards. Come to the front. Those deployed as beacon guards suffer the most and are least credited for their efforts. I know this is the training all of you would want to avoid the most. So, the three of you who didn't participate in the training have been given the lowest grade and will be going to the beacon post. Are there any objections? Seriously, does any of this make sense? It's our first day here and we're being deployed as beacon guards, does this make any sense at all? Seems like, we're finally able to take a good rest after so long. Seriously! I feel so wronged. So wronged! Beacon guards? What is that? Beacon guards? Beacon? Yes. It's the Jeilno Bongsudae located along Pyeongando, Hwanghae and Gaeseong. -=Crown Prince Sado=- Jeilno Bongsudae... It is that place. Your Royal Highness, my master has returned. Sword Saint. You're saying that Sword Saint has returned? He is together with Heuk Sa Mo sunbae now. I'm willing to give up an arm in exchange for the life of this child. So, he has already met with Ji Seon. Tell him to come look for me when he has time. Your Excellency, haven't I already told you to trust me and wait a little longer? -=Ji (Heuksa Chorong, Earth Lord)=- Have you forgotten about it so soon? -=Hong Dae Ju=- So, pasting a couple of notices on the streets has caused you to be unhappy? The one who stole the Chikseo is the big traitor, Hwang Jin Gi. How can I continue waiting without taking any actions? If you're really that unhappy, just bring Hwang Jin Gi's head to me immediately. What is that? Hwang Jin Gi's sword. Does this really belong to Hwang Jin Gi, that traitor? It is Hwang Jin Gi's sword indeed. But where is the Chikseo? That Hwang Jin Gi whom I defeated, killed himself by jumping into a sea of flame. So... The Chikseo has turned into ashes with Hwang Jin Gi. So it is no longer existing in this world. Has it really turned into ashes? What do you think of this situation? Can I trust your words? I am willing to stake my life on it. What is this? -=Muyesinbo: A chronicle of martial arts detailing the skills of assassins, compiled under the orders of Crown Prince Sado in Yeongjo 35th year (Year 1759).=- It is the Muyesinbo. Muyesinbo? -=Wolf Brush: bamboo rod with branches at one end and fitted with blades=- Rod, Cane Shield, Wolf Brush, Long Spear, Short Spear... These... how many different types of martial arts are there? 18 types. 18 types. Hyeongnim, can you show me a few tricks? Since I've lost an arm, it is quite impossible to perform them all for you to see. Does it make sense at all that you can't perform the techniques you created yourself? Isn't it said that a monk can't shave his own head? What a load of bullshit. Hey kid, aren't you Jin Ju? How do you do? Who is she? That... how should I explain? Hyeongnim, have you ever heard of Hwang Jin Gi? Hwang Jin Gi? You've been staying in Qing for nearly twenty years, it's only right that you don't know who he is. She's the daughter of the infamous traitor. He's not a traitor. She looks kind. Pardon? Thank you! Hyeongnim, this child has been tagging along with our Dong Su since they were this young. Why? Are you here to see Dong Su today? No, not that. I'm just passing through. So, I'll see you again next time. Fine, then move on. Yes. What? Traitor? If my father is a traitor, then what are you? So, this is the residence of that shoot-whatever-flying-birds, Minister of Defense, Hong Dae Ju. This is from the Western Regions, White Sandalwood. Is it really that good? Well madam, you're from a famous yangban family, how can you not know of this White Sandalwood? If you apply this, your body will exude a faint fragrance. Even men from outside of a ten-mile radius, would be attracted by this fragrance and would lose their sense of judgement. Even the drop-dead gorgeous Hwang Jin Yi has used this White Sandalwood to bathe. I'm not interested in such a frivolous item you're selling. But, can I smell its fragrance for a moment? If you smell it once, you will want to own it. This is White Sandalwood. Father. Where did you... What are these? I just did something good, why are you nagging again? Something good? You're barred unconditionally from going out from today onwards, understand? Hasn't it been always like this? Follow me. Where to? You didn't even tell me where you went. I had been looking for you everywhere. What is her name? Jin Ju. Her name is Hwang Jin Ju. Ah, it's so far. We should be somewhere near, right? Not yet. From what I see, it is far, far, far back there. Hey, since we're already out, why don't we pay Sa Mo a visit before leaving? Hey, we were assigned to guard the beacons the moment we entered the palace. Do you want to be nagged by the captain? We have to get there by noon, let's hurry up. Let's go. Oh, this is so tiring! Who is it? -=Seo Yu Dae=- This I say, the firewood must be changed everyday and kept dry. The wolf dung required to start a fire, just place them into this wooden box. Wolf dung? Yes. Must we change the firewood everyday? This is the only rule for guarding the beacons. If it rains, then there is no need to change. What do we do if we can't find wolf dung? This is a very good question. It's easiest to start a fire with wolf dung. If there isn't any more wolf dung, you can use cow dung or horse dung. What if we can't find any cow dung or horse dung? Hey rascal, are animals the only ones that shit? You can sun dry yours! -=Jang Mi So=- Seductress. She slept in the boys' dormitory last night. But no matter what, it's still a room used by the boys before. -=Jang Mi=- It isn't too convenient for a girl to stay. So I say... I understand. I can't vacate the guest rooms so... I'll let her stay in our room. Why must we do that? Why? This rotten girl. Thank you! What are you thanking me for? It's better for her to stay with us than to stay with you. Of course. You simply look like a fairy... Aigoo. I say old mister, from what I see, you must be over 50 years old. How long have you been here? - Me? - Yes. I... 20... 30 years. Thir... 30 years? I've been deployed here when I was still a Cho si qualifier. I haven't left the beacons since then. So, all of you must at least have some discernment. I say old mister... that... didn't you take the Bok Si? -=Bok Si: second examination for the Cho Si qualifiers.=- Bok Si? - Of course I did. - Then why... What's the point of taking it? No matter how well you perform here, you can never beat those fellows who have the backing of court officials. Those fellows from inside the palace, they passed the examination easily by pulling strings and giving bribes. It's useless hanging around here. In addition, if the beacons are not ignited timely, you'll have to leave and die, given the death penalty immediately! Death... death penalty? Of course. Just because the beacons were not lighted we would be given the death penalty? This is ridiculous! Hey rascal, if the beacons are ignited timely, do you think this country will be invaded by enemies? Of course not. This is the importance of being beacon guards. That's it. Hey, hey. You can make it sound more believable if you want me to believe you. Fine, don't believe me then. Don't believe. Hay rascal, last year there were people like you who didn't believe in what I said. 10... 15 of them, they left. They were given the death penalty immediately. What a bleak future. It stinks! What is this? Here. Wash all of these. What... everything? So... must you leave something unwashed? No. But, old mister... haven't you done your laundry at all? These are 1 year's worth of clothes! Only if you wash it today, then I can make it through this year. The method to pass the Bok Si... you can't say it doesn't exist. But what's the point of knowing? I'm so old already so it's useless to me. Old... old mister, are you sure? What is it? Are you curious? Wash everything. -=Heuksa Chorong=- What are you looking at? Is it funny? What are we going to do with Dae Ung, this fellow? Do as you please. But you... something about you has changed. The aura around you has changed. Did something happen? It's because I've met Gwang Taek, that fellow. Do you wish to see him? If you wish to, just visit him personally. I'll kill everyone! Isn't it obvious where that fellow is hiding now? So? What do you mean? Cut off his hand, hack off his arm and behead him! Does killing the Sword Saint benefit you in some way? Or are there any other reasons that I do not know of? What is it? Not acting on personal matters and being emotional, is the most basic Heuksa Chorong rule, and that's the rule that upholds the spirit of Heuksa Chorong. I'm sure you know that, right? How could you? Do you think the same way too? I've treated all of you sincerely. But if all of you are like this, I'll have my own plans too. What are you doing? Don't tell me you're done? The water here is so clear. As long as the clothes are dipped into the water, they'll be washed once we pull them out. Hey, Un! Un... Un. Seriously. Done. We're done. Collect the laundry. But we've just laid the clothes out to dry. Why are we collecting them now? - Rain, it's raining. - What? What is this? Rascal, didn't I already tell you to collect the laundry? Hurry! Old mister, did you already know it was going to rain? Rascal. Do I look like a fortune teller? How would I possibly know if it'll rain? - This fellow. - What? Seriously! Hey, Baek Dong Su. When are you going to start working? Hey, we are almost out of fire starters, go get some horse dung over. You all do as you deem fit. I'm very busy. This fellow is acting up again. Aigoo, my back. Aigoo! A fellow no better than horse dung. What did you say? True, looks like you're at it again. Forget it, don't bother with him. Are you finished? If you're done, come with me. Now what again? What did you say? Didn't you say you want to pass the Bok Si? That... No, it's not that. Old mister! Old mister! Old mister! Old mister! So what's the secret to pass the Bok Si? I wonder if it's because of the warm weather, - I feel like having some pickled radish today. - Pickled radish? - Do you know about the cave on that mountain over there? - Yes? I know. What about it? If you continue walking down that cave, you will find the kimchi that I prepared three years ago. Go there and get me one head of cabbage. But the weather is so hot and my waist hurts. Oh, well then. If you're like this you can forget about passing the Bok Si. I know... I know... Old mister! Old mister! No, no. There's no need. I'll go, I'll go. Old mister! I'll go get it. Great, then run along. Good, I'll be back soon. Fine, fine. I'll be back soon! Fine. Old mister, wait for me! I'll be back soon! All right, I know. This old man... why does he have to place his kimchi so far away? Dratted kimchi! I'll see how you perform. I found it. I found it. Why does he have to put it so deep inside? So deep. What is this? What? Quite delicious. Aigoo, this is really... It's a little strange. What is this? Don't come over here! Don't come over, don't come over! Come save Baek Dong Su! Really, this old man... Old mister! Old mister! I'm here. You've brought the kimchi. Good job! Looks like you're a real man. Old mister! What is it? You knew it right? About what? That cave! That cave... there were so many snakes! At least 2000! How can there be 2000 snakes? Rotten brat. See, see, you knew! So loud, shut up! Old mister! That cave has snakes? Cho Rip... I, your Hyeongnim, almost went to hell. That is a snake cave. It's very cool inside. It's best for kimchi. Look, look... He knew it... Lucky it was I, Baek Dong Su... who is able to survive after being surrounded by thousands of snakes. You braggart... Right, didn't you get bitten by a snake? How can the great Baek Dong Su be bitten by a snake? You think I'm that kind of fellow? Oh... eat, eat... Seriously, how can I maintain... my steel like body like this? Eating vegetables everyday... Look at these, only eating these... these vegetables! I really... have no energy! My whole body has no strength, you know? Old mister! Rotten brat, if you want to eat meat... go and catch them yourself! I will go and catch, I'll go. And also... that is... old mister will not get any when I caught some. You impolite rascal! Hey, but where did that brat who never talks go to? Yeo Un? Caught it... Un, you're back? We left this for you. Where did this chicken meat come from? You think that is chicken? That is eagle meat. And it's a messenger eagle... Hey, the legs... had this... -=Kill=- Kill. What's wrong? How fortunate, it's not the word for fortune... or the word for poison... Right, who knows? We might have saved a person's life? That's right. Yes. Well done. Really well done. And also, keep this from the old man. But Dong Su... - What? - Your eyes are dark, are you sick? Look, you can't even open your eyes. Are you tired? My head... actually feels a bit dizzy. I'm all right. What do you mean by you're all right? Dong Su, you... Dong Su, you... in the cave just now. Hey... It's nothing, don't make me feel embarrassed. A flower snake... just a small flower snake. I, Baek Dong Su... am not going to lose to some little flower snake. Also... this... keep it from the old man. - Baek Dong Su. - Hey, hey. - Hey, Baek Dong Su. - Dong Su! Hey, Baek Dong Su! If we leave it as it is, it will be bad... You two, close your eyes. Wait! What are you trying to do? Don't tell me that you want to cut off his arm? That's right. What? How can you cut off a martial artist's arm? That is better than death. Old... old mister! Didn't I already say... If we leave it, it's not just the arm, he will even lose his life! Do you mean to say that you can give up your limb for a comrade? I want to save this fellow's life. - Move. - Old mister. Please give me the knife. Although it is small, it is still spacious enough for three women. Thank you so much. So crowded, crowded... Horrible girl. Is anyone here? Jumo! (A jumo - female owner of jumak (a tavern) ) Quickly go and see! Should have come earlier! Only you will accompany me... What's the matter? You, this fellow with no ambition... How can you be so useless? No ambition? Is this what you're suppose to say to someone who lost his left arm? Who am I? I am Dae Ung! Dae Ung. The same Dae Ung who has gone through thick and thin with you for the past 10 years. Hey, Dae Ung. Do you think you got to your position today just by relying on our friendship? Being brothers... is a thing that comes from the heart. But you have not once entered my heart. Then have you ever entered my heart? Remember, I don't want to see you so arrogant again. If you're caught once more... I will not forgive you. Sword Saint! What has happened to you all this time? Your Royal Highness... How are you? The time passed is enough for the change of two dynasty. This is the Muyesinbo. You do still remember. -=Masangmuye: battling skills performed on horseback, includes spear, moonblade, double sword and rod.=- I lost an arm so I'm unable to complete the part on Masangmuye. You have suffered. I don't know if I can repay the debt I owe you in this lifetime. This is so worrying. How could you think of this as needing a debt? I am doing this to enrich Joseon and strengthen its military powers. Sword Saint, you are continuously teaching me. Sword Saint... if you don't mind, I will request Abamama to arrange an official position for you. Compared to me, I think it is better to give my disciple the chance instead. He'll become one of the pillars of strength of Joseon in the future. I wonder if Abamama would agree. Your Royal Highness... there is a rat in the East Palace. Who is it? I can hear you breathing from here. Aren't you the lady from Grand Hall? What is the matter? His Majesty invites Sword Saint over. Since you've already stepped foot into Joseon territories, you should have come looking for me earlier. Why did you come only now? I am sorry. -=Yeongjo=- I'm not blaming you. I heard you rejected the title Crown Prince bestowed upon you. Yes, Your Majesty. Why? Is it because the rank is too low? It's not that, Your Majesty. A position for junior third rank palace general is available. How about that? Your Majesty... Do you still find it too lowly? -=Byeongmajeoljesi: a senior third rank military official in charge of the capital.=- So, how about the position of a senior third rank Byeongmajeoljesi? Your Majesty, it's not about the rank or position. I... just wish to live a normal and carefree life with the woman I love. For the rest of my life, I only wish to live that way. You gave me an answer beyond my expectation. Fine, fine, drink up. Yes, Your Majesty. What did you say? Gim Gwang Taek has met with the Crown Prince? Yes. He is currently at the Gangnyeong Hall meeting with His Majesty. This damn Sword Saint actually made it back alive? Hey, fairy... Fairy, fairy, fairy! Dong Su, are you all right? No. Why is everyone here? Hey, meat, meat! - This outrageous fellow. - My meat. What is it? Aigoo, this silly fellow. -=Flower snake: spotted snake=- The fangs of the flower snake contain poison, don't you know? When I was younger, I read all the books on venomous snakes. But this is the first time I've ever heard of flower snakes being poisonous. Aigoo, this fellow. These are knowledge from the Goryeo dynasty, do you think you can get these from books? Aigoo, useless fellow, useless. Don't I know it now? Why must you be so calculating? So, let me start my brisk day now. Are you rascals ignoring my presence too? Do not ignore my presence. Who am I? Who do you think I am? I'm Dae Ung, one of the Lords of Heuksa Chorong, the In among Cheon, Ji and In. But look at the state I'm in now. All of you should be chasing after Sword Saint to behead him for me, but why are all of you staying in this room and not taking any action? Either you're scared of Sword Saint or you're ignoring my presence. Do you think I'm laughable? What are you doing? Who is this? Isn't this the Sky Lord? The great and famous Sky Lord. Looks like I must follow the etiquette. I've greeted the Sky Lord, but seems like it won't do. What should I do? I must follow etiquette! That's true, that's true! But there's still no improvement! Look at this! Shall I perform a sword dance for you? I can do it! Here it is, sword dance! Over here, over there! This crazy fellow... looks like you're asking for death. Death? Who says I want to die?! How can I do that? Sky Lord, I'm so sorry. I'm wrong, please forgive me. I'm in a bad mood and perhaps drank a little too much, therefore I'm so rude. In front of the Sky Lord, what exactly am I doing? You thought I will be like this, right? Why am I like this again? I apologize, I'm wrong. Please forgive me. I'm just causing some trouble because I'm drunk, how could you end my life like this? Are you such a scary person? I don't think so, right? I've already prepared the ways to capture Sword Saint. Aren't you curious? I'll tell you everything. So please, put down your sword. Dae Ung, Don't blame me. Sky Lord. Clean it up. Yes. I will not die. I definitely will not die. I'll be fine even if I lost a hand. I'll be fine even if I lost a leg. I still have my body. I'll use this body to live till the end. After that, I will kill each and every single one of you. How is Ji Seon? She is living with the other women in the jumak. Really? The methods to remove tattoo, have you checked? There is a gisaeng who has learned the art of removing tattoo from Qing. I've heard she is rather skilled at removing tattoos. Really? Make contact with her discreetly. Yes. Do you think if you forbid me, I won't be able to leave the house? What happened? Aigoo, such a young girl. What is she going to do? Aigoo, this person is really... Isn't this a bit too much? You rotten girl, how dare you... Can't you open your eyes wider when you walk? Look where you're going next time! Lowly commoners! Just can't understand these people. I'm wrong, sorry! I am sorry. How can they treat a child like that? Do you know what this place is? How dare you come begging here! This wretch, seriously! Count yourself lucky that I'm only reporting this matter today! Lowly commoner! Madam, are you all right? I'm fine. Nuna! Nuna! (Nuna - older sister) Get up! Nuna, get up and let me take a look, nuna. Are you all right? That damn fellow! So what if you're a yangban? How can he treat the child like this? Today, Cheomjae Gang Sae Hwang will look for you. Cheomjae Gang Sae Hwang, isn't he a painter? After he has copied the map from your back, the heavy burden that you, Ji Seon, has been bearing will be erased. Although tattoo removal isn't an easy feat, it is not impossible either. Your Royal Highness... Didn't I already say I will protect you? The corpse has disappeared. The corpse disappeared? Yes. Maybe he is still alive, this is really suspicious. There's no need to worry about it. He refused to die and tries his hardest to keep his life. That is also his fate. Isn't it right? Do you wish to see him? If you wish to, just visit him personally. Why? This is my first meeting with you, Your Royal Highness. I asked for Cheomjae, why are you here instead? -=Gim Hong Do=- After a bout of illness, my teacher who found it inconvenient to travel, sent me here instead. You're adept at scenery and folk paintings. Since it's like this, let me ask you a question. Can you keep a secret? The moment I stepped into this place, I have blocked my ears and eyes. The moment I step out of this place, I will shut my mouth. This is what my teacher taught me. Can I trust you? Yes, Your Royal Highness. Just leave it to me. The samini who entered that place, have you ran a background check on her? She has been entering and leaving the temple since 10 years ago. But where she lives and who she is, nobody knows. Wait, did you say 10 years ago? Yes. From what I heard, seems like she also went to Qing before. Qing? How old's the samini this year? A bang nyeon lady. Your Excellency, why do you laugh? Retarded fellow, haven't you thought of it yet? What? If it's a woman meeting with the Crown Prince, it's likely she's the daughter who escaped with Yu So Gang 10 years ago. It's definitely her. What? If it's Yu So Gang's daughter... Fantastic. I can finally see it now, the results of this very long war. How much longer will it take? I am really sorry. Don't be anxious. Don't be careless and draw well. How could there be three maps? Your Royal Highness, the map on that lady's back... there are more than one. It may look like only one map, but there are actually three maps combined into one.
