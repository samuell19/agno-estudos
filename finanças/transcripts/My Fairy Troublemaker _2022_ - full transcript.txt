Tooth ready for pick up. Please proceed to the travel terminal. Tooth ready for pick up. Please proceed... Welcome everybody to our annual Tooth Fairy exams. The gems are on their way, which means we are about to begin. All students who complete today's test will officially become Tooth Fairies. I'm definitely gonna pass this time, Gwen. I know it. And then I can finally show the world that I'm the most special Tooth Fairy ever. Shh. May the Tooth Fairy exam begin. Sneak inside, take the tooth, make the toy and disappear. Oh. Sneak inside, take the tooth, make the toy and disappear. It's about to begin. Incredible. Come on, what's my name? Yolando. What's my name? Yolando, Yolando. I'm Yolando. Huh? Here is your gem. It grants you the power to enter and exit the human world. Congratulations, Yolando. It is an honor, Professor Laurin. Greetings, Yolando. I am your own personal gem. Please say your name so I can attune myself to your voice. I am Yolando. What a dork. "I'm Yolando. I'm a perfect student, and I say my name a lot and I think Violetta eats too many cookies." Yolando doesn't understand. Cookies taste so good. They gotta be good for you. It's science. Hey, give that back, Gwen. Oh, Violetta. Ready for the test? Everyone else passed. It'd to be pretty embarrassing to be the only one to fail, huh? Violetta. Your turn. Looks like I gotta fly. Oh, um, do you have a napkin? Never mind. I'll just use this. Ah, my vest! Oh. - Someone help. - Ready? Mm-hm! Here we go. Oh my gosh, is that a water dragon riding a horde of fire pixies? Sneak inside. - Hm. - Hm. Oops. Take the tooth. Come on. Oh. Make the toy. Ta-da. A dragonfly doll. Uh, Violetta, that toy doesn't match the room. - Look around you. - Huh? I just thought maybe a dragonfly doll would be nicer than a robot sword car, but okay, whatevs. Robot sword car, robot sword car. Robot sword car! What? Oh, perfect. This is definitely exactly what I meant to do. Huh? Ha, I was right. Oh, are we pretending to be surprised? I mean, aww, come on. It's the same every year. I don't wanna go to the city. No grass, no flowers, just Amir and those boys. Yuck. Mm. I'll miss you, Mister Tree. Maxie, time to go, sweetie. Come on. Hm. Oh. "Dear new house owner. My mom and I need to move. Can you please be extra nice to Mister Tree until we're back? Love, Maxie." - Um. - Huh? You know I don't play with this thing anymore, right? Well, we'll just put it in the basement, okay? Oh, a violet. What a nice idea. I bet Amir has a perfect spot for it Amir, Amir, Amir. Time's ticking honey. Come on. I'll let you pick the music. Yay. Lucky me. There's always next time. That's what you said last time. I was right then, wasn't I? Can't you just pass me? I basically finished the whole thing. You have to prove you're ready. Returning home is the most important step and you didn't even get close. The human world is a terribly dangerous place for an unprepared Tooth Fairy. Yeah, yeah. Like I'll ever find out. I know you're eager to see the human world, but there's only one way to prove you're ready and that's here at our school. May I keep this? It's quite lovely. Knock yourself out. Thank you. Goodnight, Violetta. Oh. "You have to prove you're ready." I'm special, I know it. A test can't measure specialness. The only way to show that is just to show it. Quiet, Gwen, something's happening in my brain. An idea. Forget that test. I'll just show them I can handle the human world, with my master plan. This afternoon, heavy rain and strong winds are battering our city. The situation is forecast to improve by tomorrow. Meanwhile, people are asked to protect their houses from those high wind peaks. In other news, more demonstrations outside the former city greenhouse today. They're talking about Amir. Environmentalist Amir Inan is fighting to quote, "Save the very last patch of green in the entire city." However, developer Boris Rick plans to construct a luxury hotel on the same site. Amir wants to turn the greenhouse into a public park. Ooh, maybe we can plant your violet there when he beats that creep, Boris Rick. Hey, get outta here, you green freaks. You really wanna live here? I know it's different, but the job I got at the hospital, it's really good and-- You just wanna be with Amir. It's true, I love Amir, but it will be good for you to have other kids around, too. Just promise me you'll give this whole family thing a chance, huh? - Okay. - That's my girl. Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you. You don't have to share a room. You'll take Sami's and he'll share with Tarek, isn't that great? Yeah, if Tarek doesn't kill me. You made it. Hey, sorry we're late. Traffic was terrible. It's so good to see you. Hey! I hope you're ready for some unpacking. Hey, watch it, kid. Hey ya, Maxie. Welcome home. Hi, Amir. Oh, ha. No biggie. We'll, uh, we'll rain check that hug for later. Uh. Hi, Sami. Hey, Tarek. I have to share my room with this runt because of you. I don't wanna be here at all, okay? Well, make things easy, then, and go away. Tarek! Want some gum? Uh, sure. Thanks, Sami. You fell for it. - You fell for it. - Sorry, Maxie. He's gotten pretty into practical jokes. They're harmless, mostly. Hey sweetie, why don't you go check out your new room? Your new bed won't be here until next week, but I'll have Tarek bring up your other stuff. Nice flower, by the way. Ugh. Awesome. I think you might be the only plant in the whole city. Nice doll house, you big baby. Ugh, this whole family thing stinks. Oh, I just wanna go home. Maxie, boys, dinner's ready. I get the first one. - Ah! - Ah, ah, Sami. I just want to say that I'm very happy to start the next chapter of our family. And to celebrate, pancakes with chocolate syrup. Enjoy. Great speech, Shakespeare. Can we eat now? Ow. Look, a loose tooth! Sami, please. We have two new family members in the house. Let's uh, tone it down, pal. Ow. My tooth! Huh? Tooth ready for pick up. Yay. Please proceed to the travel terminal for subject, Sami Inan. - Your first job. - Good for you. You're going to nail it. Okay guys, catch you later. Duty calls. - Bye. - Good luck! Mm, delicious. Gotta fuel up before I start my master plan. You wanna hear it? Step one, steal a gem, sneak into the human world, then find a tooth, come back and prove I'm the world's most special Tooth Fairy. What do you mean it sounds complicated? It's only one step. Tooth ready for pick up. Please proceed to... This is perfect. I know exactly where I can get my gem. Welcome, Yolando Twinklefart. Yolando's last name is Twinklefart? Please proceed to the Rainbow Gate. Wow. Hey, now's my chance. Wee-hee. My tooth! I need my tooth! - The Tooth Fairy won't come-- - It can't have gone far. Oh, oh, I found it. Yes! I'm gonna get a toy! I hope it's a whoopee cushion! Oh, it's glorious. Nothing can possibly ruin this-- Violetta? How did you get in? You're not allowed to be-- - Huh? - ...here. All lost teeth will be returned to the security deck. Holy Fairy Godmother. You shouldn't be here, Violetta. Try and stop me, Twinklefart. Yolando will stop you himself. Yolando can eat my fairy dust. Huh? Ah, my eyes! Yolando's beautiful eyes. Watch out for flying jerks. Oops. I did try to warn you. Oh no, not Yolando. Don't worry. I'll take care of him. Yolando, please report to Rainbow Gate to subject Sami Inan. Hey sweetie. Ready? Mm-hm. Hey. My best moment today was when the last box was finally in the house. I didn't realize we had so much stuff. My best moment today was.... Your new room, maybe? When I was sitting with Mister Tree. Oh, honey. Mm. Oh. - I have to go to the hospital. - Already? They're short-staffed and my transfer of paperwork already went through. I'm sorry, Max. Amir's downstairs working if you need anything. Huh? Huh? Hey, where is it? Huh, huh? My gem. Oh, why? Violetta! Welcome Marygazy Pebbleswright. You may enter the Rainbow Gate. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Stop! Gem thief! Someone stop her. - She stole Yolando's gem! - Excuse me. Excuse me, special fairy coming through. Ha. Let me in! You dumb computer! Open the gate. She stole my gem. I don't wanna hear it. It'll be fi.... This rainbow tickles. Huh? We made it. See, Gwen? Everything went perfect. Re--recalculating. Okay, we'll give you some time to recalculate, Mister Gem. In the meantime, let's get inside. My master plan is ruined. Huh? Huh? Oh, my master plan is saved. I owe you one, Gwen. Help me out. Ah! Oh, wow. Oh, mm. That is the best thing I have ever tasted. Mm. I know, I know. The tooth. But I can't work on an empty stomach. Oh. Mm-mm. Oh, hm. I knew I'd love the human world. Oh. Come on. Help me with it. Uh oh. Amazing. Okay, I'll only take one. Hm. What? What? Oh. Professor, help. Yolando, what is it? Yolando's gem has been stolen by Violetta. Delayed. Delayed. Delayed. Delayed. - Huh? - Delayed. Ca--calculating the distance to Sami's room. Sa-mi. This must be it. Error, room change. Please wait, Yolando Twinklefa-- Already found it, bro. And I ain't no Yolando. Sneak inside, check. Now, take the tooth. Time to prove myself. Huh? Nothing. What the? Where is it? Calculating... You can lecture me later, Gwen. Right now, we need a tooth. These ones are stuck inside. Let's just make a toy. Race car, race car. Race car? Okay, time to prove my ultimate specialness. Race car, race car, super not a flower race car. Is it a car, Gwen? Buzz once for yes, 298 times for no. I did it? Oh, two, three, four... This is taking too long. I failed. I can't do it. I really thought I was special. Huh? Wait a second. She loves flowers. Cars and flowers. I did it, Gwen. The perfect gift. Oh, right. Sleeping human. Come on, let's get out of here. You're welcome, Sami Inan. Gem, disappear. This thing should get us home no matter what. Huh? Huh? Hey, look, it's okay. Just stay calm, okay? Maxie broke my candy jar. No, I didn't. Look, could everyone just stay back? Go get some shoes on so you don't cut yourselves. - It was Maxie. - It wasn't me. Well someone broke it. Tarek. - What happened? - I don't know. It was Maxie's fault. I don't even know what this is. Looks like chocolate, genius. But I didn't do anything. Honey, if you had some candy-- You don't believe me? Ugh! I hate it here. Ugh, how did that get there? Violet, look at you. Huh? Who's there? Sami? Oh. How did you get here? Huh? Huh? - Is it breakfast time? - What on earth? Huh? Sami! What did you put in my dollhouse? Okay, little lady. Hand over the tooth. What are you? Stay away from me, you talking bug bird thing. I am not a bug or a bird or even a thing. I'm a Tooth Fairy. I'm going crazy. Nuh-uh, you can go crazy after I get that tooth. - What tooth? - Playing dumb, huh? Well, nobody plays dumber than me. Wait, that didn't come out right. You cannot be real. There are no such thing as tooth fairies. Actually, there are, like me, Violetta. We're really not supposed to tell you we exist. But look, I need your tooth to get home. Oh yeah, and this is Gwen. She's cool. - Did you-- - Conjure it up? You bet. That's your prize. Therefore, you, Sami Inan, owe me one tooth. I'm not Sami. My name is Maxie. I lost all my teeth ages ago. Huh? Then who's Sami? He's my step bro... He lives in the next room. I can't believe you're real. Believe it, girlfriend. Now listen, I need your help. Can you get Sami's tooth for me? What? No. No way. Please? This is my first mission and ugh, I'm in this totally new world all alone and I can't blow it. All alone, huh? Fine, I'll get the tooth. I bet it's still under his pillow. One sec. Wow. At least I'm right about one thing. Professor Laurin's exam does not prepare you for this. Mm-mm-mm. Oh. I mean, hi. What were you doing in my room? Um, I uh, felt bad that Sami didn't get a toy for his tooth, so I got him one of these. So cool. Everyone knows how much boys love flowers. That is a stereotype. And flowers are cool, so there. From now on, keep outta my room. Imagine when we get back, Gwen. We'll be heroes who overcame a lost tooth and survived the human world. - Ugh! - What's wrong? It's nothing. Just an annoying jerk. Yuck, I know one of those. You keep doing you, girl. Ignore stupid Yolando, or whatever his name is. Thanks. Here. Oh. Goodbye, Maxie. Oh, you're leaving so soon? Thanks for your help. Hold on, Gwen. Let's disappear. Dang it. Come on. In you go. Disappear. Disappear. Disappear! Disappear, disappear, disappear. Uh oh. Um, is everything okay? Hmm, mm-mm. Mm, I think we can glue it back together. What did you say? Glue? You don't have glue in the Fairy World? It sticks things together. Oh, we use magic for that. Wait, if I help you to get home, will you use your magic to get me home? Hmm. Sure, boom. You're home. No. My real home. Look. If I help you, could you take me back here? So many flowers and you're sitting in a huge green flower. That's called a tree. Well, see, I'd love to help, Maxie, but the thing is, I really need that gem fixed first. Oh, okay. It's fine. I get it. Oh. I'll do it! I will magic you home. Somehow. You will? - Yep. - Deal? It's a deal. Thanks, Violetta. My first job ruined. My gem missing. - Woe is Yolando. - Yolando. We have a bigger problem. Your gem isn't responding to my signals and without it, Violetta is stuck in the human world. Eh, don't worry about her, professor. No fairy has gone full flower in years. That is only because no fairy has been delayed in years. We must go and save Violetta. But none of these gems are mature enough to take us to the human world. Oh dear, oh dear. Ah-ha, there's only one thing for it. Come on, Yolando, this calls for a trip to the library. The library? Professor, wait. Wait, professor. Hey, go easy! There's precious cargo in here. Can somebody pass me the ketchup? I know, it's a crazy combination, but I like it. Maxie, I'm getting nauseous. Shh. Ouch. My kidney. Is there enough for everybody? Okay, wrap that up tight. Yeah, there's plenty. Maxie, is that you? We're leaving soon. Yeah, I'm just going to buy some glue for a project. A project? Well, you can do that later. Amir has organized a last minute demonstration. We're all going. You're gonna love the old greenhouse, Maxie, I promise. Yep, it's rusty and smells weird. Feel the excitement. Can't wait. Ow! My other kidney. We're coming to you live from the former city greenhouse. In a moment, environmentalist, Amir Inan, who, with the permission of City Council, will open the greenhouse doors to the public in order to hold a demonstration. Welcome to our beautiful greenhouse. Yay! Psst, can I have some of your sandwich? Shh, be quiet. Keep your head down. This greenhouse is our... Oh wow. Flowers. Look at this place. Huh? A tree. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry, excuse me. - Hey. Oh. Oh, wow. I knew you'd like it here. That tree is the oldest one in the whole city. It looks just like Mister Tree. Who's Mister Tree? Well, Maxie had this special-- Hey, Amir, Amir. Can I get you quickly for a quote? This is the radio. We want--we want to interview... Your adoring fans. I'd better say something. Amir, Amir. Amir, over here, over here. Thank you for coming, my friends. Time is running short to stop this beautiful place from becoming a hotel. Maxie. It smells like old cheese and dirty socks in here. Wow. Oh. Whoa. Is this one of those trees you were talking about? We don't have these in Fairyland. Maxie, come down. Family photo. Ugh. Come on, in you go. No way. Fine. I'll be back soon. Don't move and don't get spotted. I swear by all that is sweet and chocolatey. But Professor, I don't understand, sir. Why are we at the library? To save Violetta, we must find the old portal. Sir, wait, the what? - Portal, what-- - Shh. There it is. Are you sure? Oh, stop blabbering and get a move on. Halt! That is a secure area. Camelia. Oh, my. Laurin. I didn't recognize you. Please tell your youngling to stay out of the archives. That is where we keep our most intricate, extremely fragile documents. Yolando didn't know. Yolando would never break the rules. Who's Yolando? Camelia, I'm here to return this book. It's quite overdue. I should say so. You have had it for nearly 834 moons. Sorry, my dear. You know how time slips by. Very well, very well. This book happens to belong to the top floor. Don't move until I return. Follow me. She won't be gone long. Really? Oh. Huh? Oh, well, I guess Yolando can break the rules just this once. Big smiles, everybody. Save the plants. Save the plants, save the plants. Shh. Sorry, it's stuck in my head. I bet I'm the first fairy ever to get this close to so many people. Maxie won't care. I'll just get a little closer. At this rate, Professor Laurin will never let me back into the human world, so I'd better get all my gawking in now. Don't worry, Gwen. I won't get spotted. We demand that the city council recognize this greenhouse is our city's biggest treasure. Time is running... Save the plants. Mommy. Oh, sweetheart. Here you go, it's your favorite. Mm. Holy Fairy Godmother. My chocolate! What's the matter? Violetta. Violetta. Our mission is simple. This place belongs to... Chaos has broken out here at the old greenhouse. There appears to be some kind of attack. Uh-oh, that might have been a mistake. Oh, so good. Definitely not a mistake. Everyone, stay calm, please. There's no need to leave. Looks like your little rally's already over, Inan. What are you doing here, Rick? Well, I just came to watch your movement implode. And you didn't disappoint me. If you hurt these people, I'll have you prosecuted. Well, your own kid started the pandemonium, Inan. I saw it all myself. I should pay him. Couldn't have done it better if I tried. Laugh all you want, Rick. The greenhouse is staying. Oh yeah, keep dreaming. Soon this will all be king sized beds, tiny bottles of shampoo as far as the eye can see. What have I told you about these jokes, Sami? It wasn't my fault, Dad. - Maxie pushed me. - Did not. I tripped. And you already had the bottle out. - Maxie, honey, calm down. - But I didn't do anything. It doesn't matter whose fault it is. This story will make us look like idiots. This is the last thing we need right now. I get the blame for everything around here. Huh? What is the old portal, professor? It's how we used to get to the human world, before we built the Rainbow Gate. And it still exists? Impossible. I would've heard of it. The Fairyland that you know, and in particular, this very library, were built right on top of it. Uh-huh, but how? Oh, no. I knew we shouldn't have come here. Laurin, I knew you were up to something, you crusty, old witherbean. I am coming down! - We must hurry. - Laurin! Look for anything old. The dustier, the better. Old? You mean like everything is around here? The entrance is hidden here somewhere. Laurin! Don't move a muscle! Huh? Look, sir, down there. Looks like some kind of words. You're right, Yolando. Fascinating. To find the portal, simply stand right here. Whoa. Success. Yolando has done it. Laurin, I'm right behind you. Welcome to the old world, Yolando. Why wasn't I told about this? A whole new old world. Hmm, let's see. Huh? How's it looking, doctor? I think I can get it back together. But it's so small. Hm? Huh, huh? Ah? Oh, no. What happened to your foot? Nothing. Oh! Ugh. Huh? Oh no. Oh no, oh no. We can still fix it, right? Get more of your human glue? What happened to your foot? Oh, just... Magic. Cool, right? The old world is full of rich magic, lost to time. We must be the first fairies to visit here in ages. Whoa. Are these gem flowers growing here naturally? Indeed. Long before we cultivated gems for magical travel, they grew wild and free. - Oh. - Huh? The old portal. It still exists. Ha ha, my beloved gem. Yolando is coming for you. It won't work, Yolando. The old portals are powered by the magic of moonlight. It can only be opened under the light of a full moon. Did you say portals? Yes, there is a portal in the human world as well. Someone must find it. Someone must wait for the full moon, then someone must unlock it. And by someone you mean Violetta? You are our only chance to deliver this key to Violetta. So your foot is totally normal? Um, yeah, it's good for me, actually. It's part of a green detox I'm doing. Some people eat vegetables. I become one. If you say so. So how do we get you back home without your gem? If I was lost, I'd have Mom come pick me up. Can you call someone? That's a slam bang idea, Maxie. - All we need is another tooth. - Huh? Hm. No way! I'm not playing dentist with you! Oh, come on, Sami. I'm sure you have another loose tooth. Ugh. Hm? Mm-mm. They're my teeth. Why do you even need a tooth? I didn't even get a toy last time. - Take one of mine. - Huh? Hm. This is girl's stuff. Ow, watch it. That doll can talk? I'll take her. - No, wait. - Cool, she's so squishy. Let go of her. Ha, ha, ha! Whoa, whoa. Watch the wings, kid. Ouch! Hello, Sami, I'm Violetta, probably the best Tooth Fairy in history. Maxie, everything okay in there? - Tooth Fai-- - Uh-huh, we're fine. Just playing. Violetta needs our help getting back home. That's why I need your tooth. Okay. Sounds fun. Let's knock out another one of those teeth. Hey, Tarek, could I borrow these sneakers for an art project? No! They're limited edition! Ah. Yeah. Oh. Hey! Yes! - Yes! - We did it! - Yay! - Now we just sit back and wait for my ride. Oh, but professor, how will I ever find Violetta? Huh? - Huh? - Whoa. Oh. Yolando, the magic of the old world will take you wherever you need to go. Take it, Yolando. Careful. Now. Uh... Greetings, Yolando. So cool. Tooth ready for pickup. Subject, Sami Inan. I've got to save Violetta. This has all been too much excitement for one day. I love the stars. My mom says they're the flowers of the sky and when flowers on earth have to rest, they blossom up there. But I bet nothing here compares to Fairy World. Right? I like it better here. I don't really fit in back home. You should stay. Just magic us both back to the countryside and you can live in my treehouse. You'll love it. There are flowers everywhere. Mountains, hummingbirds. I can't wait to go back. It might not be that simple. Look. Huh? Sneak inside. Yolando. Violetta. You're alive. Huh? The transformation has already started. Oh. My gem. No! Ah, the human is awake. Oh, this is all too much to process. Is he always like this? Unfortunately, yes. Pull yourself together, Yolando. The tooth's under the pillow over there. Just go and get it so we can leave. Do you remember nothing from school? Oh, of course. - Every fairy needs exactly-- - Blah, blah, blah. ...one tooth and exactly one gem to return home. Since you have destroyed my gem, you must find another way back. Uh yeah, right. Very funny. No, burps are funny. This is serious. Somewhere around here is an ancient portal to Fairyland. You must find a mysterious being called a tree. A tree, huh? In that tree will be that portal. Tree, moon, unlock portal. Got it. I'm not stupid, you know. No one else failed the exam. Take the tooth. Make a toy. Remember, when the moon is full, Violetta. Don't be late. I'd hate to see you go full flower. And I wanna make sure you're properly punished. Disappear. Huh? Ugh, I hate that nincompoop. What did he mean by full flower? And what exam? Did you steal his gem? Ugh, he's just been a jerk. It's all, um, very complicated. Fairy stuff, you wouldn't understand. Hmm. The important thing is we have to find that portal. An ancient portal in an old tree? Hm, I've only seen one tree in the city. The one in the greenhouse. Huh? Huh? Oh. Don't worry, Gwen. I won't become a flower just yet. Ready to find the door? Oh, yeah. Can't wait. A whoopee cushion! I got a whoopee cushion! - Great. - Yes! Can't wait to see where he puts that. Here we go. Why would anyone want to destroy this? Maybe they hate things that smell good? Come on, let's search the tree. If I was a portal, where would I hide? Check the knot holes. They look a bit like portals. Great, checking knot holes. Whatever those are. Woo. Huh? Oh my gosh, here it is. Well done, Maxie. Try the key. It fits. Now we just have to wait for the full moon. Woo hoo! Uh oh. What's happening, Violetta? Um, if a fairy stays in the human world for too long, it eventually becomes a flower. Forever? Can you make it until the full moon? You betcha. You better. You're my friend. You're my friend, too, Maxie. Huh? Come on, in here. It's the hotel guy. What's he doing here? Let's move it. Come on. This place gives me the creeps. The air is too fresh. I'll take a look. No, wait. Stay outside if you're scared. Hurry up, you big lug, so we can get outta here. I'm on it, boss. Poison? Look at all this. Inan and his stupid plants. If you ask me, this place will be a lot prettier once it's a construction site. Come on, we got a whole 'nother barrel of weed killer to pick up. Violetta? Are you okay? Maxie? Violetta. What was that? I dunno. I probably knocked something loose in there. Well, that's one less thing we gotta trash when we officially own this place. Violetta? Gwen, can you see Violetta? Come on. Think of something. Violetta, do something. Like what? I dunno. Magic. I don't think violets are gonna help in a time like this. Well, can't you cast a different spell, then? Amir? Is that you? Well, well, well, what do we got here? Ain't this a nice surprise? It's okay. You're home now. Huh? Maxie. Thank you, officer. We'll take it from here. You're welcome. Have a good day. Maxie, are you okay? - Yeah. - What happened, sweetie? I'm sorry, Mom. Well, that's what the good people in this city wanna know because it appears your daughter tried to burn down the greenhouse. Is this part of your movement? No comment. Well you better think of one-- ...'cause I'm sure the city council's gonna wanna hear it. See you later, Inan. Is this part of your movement? No comment. Amir Inan can no comment all he wants, but an arson attempt by his own stepdaughter won't help his quest to protect the city's greenhouse. Oh, I don't understand. This isn't like Maxie at all. Why would she even think of doing something like this? Maybe this whole move was unfair on her. What are you saying? I have to think about what's best for Maxie. But, what would that mean for us? For you and me? I don't know. Hey. You all right? No. Why didn't you cast a spell and stop the fire? I, um, I don't... You can't really do magic, can you? Like put out fires or take me home? You lied to me, so I'd help you. I thought we were friends. I--I didn't mean to lie. I just, I was scared and I'm sorry, Maxie. You should leave. It's almost sunset, then the moon will come out and you can go back to where you came from. I... Bye, Maxie. Oh. Oh, fascinating. Hm. Huh? I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared! Ah! - Yolando. - Greetings, professor. I wasn't scared. Never. Did you deliver the key? Is Violetta all right? Yes, she's fine. Same old Violetta, unfortunately. Except her transformation has begun. Oh, dear. Let us hope she finds the portal by full moon, because she might be something quite extraordinary. Violetta? My thoughts exactly. They tell the story of ancient fairies who were alive long before even I was born. I now believe that the reason she is such a terrible Tooth Fairy is that she is a reborn Flower Fairy with the power to heal nature. For the first time in Yolando's life, Yolando is lost for words. Hey, kiddo. Talk to me, Maxie. No, Maxie. I want you to talk to me. What do you wanna know? Well, how you're doing, what you're thinking about. You really wanna know? Mm-hm. I met a Tooth Fairy. A Tooth Fairy? Yes, she told me if I helped her, she would use magic to send us back home. But she lied. All she did was cause trouble. She's the reason I was at the greenhouse. Okay, I guess you're not ready to have a serious discussion. Let's try again tomorrow. But Mom-- What about the key? I thought you had it. Uh-uh. Oh, great. This is the last thing we need. I was wrong. This is the last thing we need. Gwen! Gwen! Gwen? Maxie, pee-ew. Leave me alone, Sami. Uh, wait, are you running away? Where's Violetta? She's going back home to Fairyland. Doesn't she need this? - Huh? - You little brat. Where did you get that? Violetta? - Violetta? - Hm. Violetta? Violetta? Violetta, where are you? I should have helped her. At least she tried to help me. Gwen, help! I think I just swallowed a rotten fish head. Hey, get back here so I can poop on you! Ugh, never mind. It's no use, Gwen. I'm done for. This is crazy. Fairies? She never used to lie. Is she hallucinating? Just relax, Hannah. It's probably an--an imaginary friend or something. But a walking, talking fairy? How could she possibly believe-- - Hey, Sami. - Oh, hi, Sami. Violetta is real. She's my Tooth Fairy and Violetta's Tooth Fairy friend brought me this whoopee cushion. Wow, when did your other tooth fall out? It didn't fall out. Maxie pulled it out so Violetta's Tooth Fairy friend would come so Violetta could ride home with him, only now she needs to find a portal. Right, and who's Violetta? Hey, I think Maxie ran away. She's not here. Oh. Oh, Maxie. - Oh. - Pretty cool move, actually. Tarek. I mean, uh, oh no, where'd she go? I know where she went. Gwen. - Hi, Maxie. - Violetta? I can make it the rest of the way, Gwen. Ah. Ah, ah! Oh, no, Violetta, you're still a fairy. I was afraid you went full flower. Nope, just like 92% vegetable. I'm sorry I got so mad. I should have helped you. No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied. I was just so afraid you'd abandon me. But I wasn't being a good friend, and you are my friend, Maxie. You're my friend too, Violetta. Heck, you're my only friend. Darn it. All I wanted to be was a Tooth Fairy. Now I'm about to be a weed. And we lost the key. Here you go. Sami found it. Oh, that kid's annoying, but he does tend to come in handy. Oh, yeah. That jerk. Do your thing. - Hey, stop it! - Huh? What? Huh? You again. How much trouble can one girl cause? - You better get down, Maxie. - No way. You have to get home. You snotty little brat! Get down right now so I can knock your precious tree to kingdom come. No! Make me! Maxie! Rick, stop! This land is mine, Inan. You and your family can't stop me and my family with our range of luxury hotels, at a friendly price. Don't. Get away from me. Maxie, watch out! Maxie! What are you people doin' here? Hey you, keep away from my brother. Don't you hurt him. Stop! Hi there, I'm a doctor and I'm happy to say that you haven't received any serious injuries. Yet. Ah. Rick, stop! Oh, no. No! - Maxie! - No! - Maxie! - Hold tight, Violetta! Help! Ah! Maxie! Whoa, whoa! Maxie! Ma--Maxie? Maxie, where are you? Maxie, sweetie. - Mom? - Are you okay? Uh, I think so. What are you doing here? Mom, this is my friend Violetta. I need to save her. Oh, I never knew. It's really unbelievable. Told you so. I don't believe it. The portal. We need to open the portal. Oh, okay, honey. But be careful. It won't turn. Evidently, Violetta needs to unlock it from her side first. Fascinating. Not everything is fascinating, professor. Some things are just terrifying and nerve wracking. Calm yourself, Yolando. Sir, the moon. It's almost gone. Tree, portal, moon, unlock. The portal needs the moon. It's too close to the ground. Violetta, can you heal the tree? We've been over this. I'm not really a very good fairy. But you healed my violet. - I did? - Yes. When you first arrived. I think you can heal plants, Violetta. Really? It's worth a try, isn't it? It's okay. Uh huh. Wow. Look. You did it, Violetta. Huh? Oh, no. Please. No. Violetta, no. - Oh. - It'll be okay. Come on. Come on. Maxie. Oh. - Oh, Violetta. - Violetta. Whoa! Whoa! Mm. We're too late. - Oh, Violetta. - Oh, my emotions. They hurt. Huh? - Oh. - Whoa. - Fascinating. - Yes! It actually is. Violetta, you've changed. Holy Fairy Godmother! But you're still you. Hey, Yolando bows to the majestic fairy of old. The majestic fairy of old says to quit suckin' up. We're cool, dude. Thanks for your help saving me. And now professor, perhaps we should discuss Violetta's punishment? There's still the small matter of my stolen gem. - Oh. - Huh? Well, I'm still me, and I guess you're still you, Yolando. Thank you. I'm afraid to tell you that you will never be able to pass the preparedness examination. - What? - Yes! You are not a Tooth Fairy, Violetta. You're a Flower Fairy. The first we've had in quite a long time. A Flower Fairy? You can heal plants and create flowers. I think I can get used to that. I'm the most special Flower Fairy ever! Oh! Hey! No, stop! My beautiful luxury hotel. You're ruining it! Oh, put a flower in it. Yay! A most fascinating evening. But I think it's best we return to Fairyland before anything else unexpected happens. Come along, Violetta. We must start testing your abilities post haste. Well, so long. I'll miss you, Violetta. I'll miss you, too. I bet even Gwen will miss this place. Will I ever see you again? How does every full moon sound? - Great. - See you soon, Maxie! See you, Violetta! Don't forget to bring the chocolate!
