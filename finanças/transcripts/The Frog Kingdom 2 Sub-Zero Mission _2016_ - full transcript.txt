Hm? Huh? - Huh? Ah. - [grunting] Wow, looky, looky here. A full house. There's ladies and gentlemen, tadpoles and... Humans! Watch out! They're dangerous! But they seem so friendly, why dangerous? Hmm? Because Silly's been captured. Huh? Perhaps our new buddies took a liking to him. Humans will eat anything. Be careful or you'll get boiled. Huh? Boiled frog? Luckily, I'm so skinny! You're the prime target if they're hungry for a frog. Hm? What? Me as food? If they knew our clan, they'll love us, not eat us. Well, then, let's introduce them to the Frog Kingdom! Okay! Let's go! [grunting] [water splashing] [cheering] [male narrator] In a world far, far away from human beings, there is a beautiful place, called Frog Kingdom. For thousands of years, the frog clan has lived here. Full of joy and wonder. What a wonderful life they have. However, beneath these happy times, a conspiracy is quietly unfolding. [grunting] [grunting] [woman] Ababwa, stop moving around! You volunteered for my archery practice. No one begged you! I'm good, right? You wanna take it to the next level? [trembling] Let's make it a little more interesting! - [giggling] - [Ababwa yelling] No! Princess! If the king knew about your trips to the barracks, you'd be in big trouble. But I'm just getting started! [woman] Princess, it's time to go home! Here goes nothing! [screaming] Huh? [man] General! [panting] Hm? Have a look at this! - Hm? - Huh? Crystal Frog? [gasps] [Frog Princess] What's a Crystal Frog? I'd better go tell Father. - Bestie, let's go! - Princess, where are we going? [Frog Princess] Back to the palace! [Bestie] Wait for me! What about me? [groans] Your Majesty, flyers of the Crystal Frog have appeared again. Strange. Royal secrets known outside the palace? Set up an emergency team, so we can investigate the leak about the Crystal Frog. Oh, don't worry, your Majesty. I'll take command of the investigation. - [Frog Princess] Father! - Huh? Father! Ah! Huh? [grunting] Hm? You're a princess. You should carry yourself with more dignity. Of course, right. Anyway, these flyers say that there's a Crystal Frog out there! - What does it mean? - You're still young. I'll tell you when you've grown up. [grunts] Noggin, tell me now! Uh... Ask him! I don't know anything. Don't worry about it. I could just go find out myself. - Princess... Wait. - Hm? Come back. Huh? - [Frog King] Fine then. - Go on. Princess, I promise I will tell you one day. This is our family's biggest secret. Only at the end of the Frog King's reign will the secret be revealed to his successor. Ugh, so mysterious! [sighs] Not only is it mysterious, but the whole kingdom depends on it. Then you should tell me now! For the sake of the kingdom, we need to protect the Crystal Frog and its secrets. Well, can you at least tell me where it is? In a mysterious holy land. But I really can't say any more now. So where is this holy land, Father? Enough! So many questions! Uh, we have more state issues to discuss, so go along now. Then I'll just go find it by myself. Stop it! Right this minute! Don't meddle with this anymore and stay in the palace. You cannot stop me! As successor to the throne, why must you be so hot-headed? - Stop acting like a child. - [grunts] Everything in life is like a coin. When you look at one side, you can't see the other side. Don't be concerned with appearances. Only with humility can one find the truth Look, I know I can be impulsive sometimes, but at least when I'm running the kingdom I won't be issuing orders from afar like you! Enough! You had better change your attitude! - No way! - If you keep acting like this, I'll forbid you from leaving the palace. [grunts] I'm not a child anymore. I'll go where I please. Uh, Your Majesty, the princess is impatient, but she loves the kingdom. Please keep calm. Your health is important. She's already grown up, so she has her own ideas. I know. I just wish she could control her temper. Summon the Frog Warriors back to the palace. [Noggin] Yes, Majesty! [buzzing] Game on! [boy] Target is moving at 1.66 meters per second. Your speed, compensated by tailwind is 1.88 meters per second. I'm on alert and poised for action. According to my current analysis, you will lose to me! [buzzing] You're quick. I'd consider that one a tie, so we each won half the match. You're good, Boogie. Even without technology you track pretty well. My teacher says, "Knowledge is power." Yeah. And my teacher says, "The area of a circle is equal to pi r-squared", whatever that's supposed to mean. - Freddy, you're so old school. - It's takes one to know one. - Wow! - Huh? Why does it sound like Freddy? You're right, yeah, it is him! - Hey, Freddy! - Hey, Muscles, Devo! Good to see you guys! What's going on? Devo said Noggin summoned everyone. We don't exactly know why. Something about a Crystal Frog? - What's a Crystal Frog? - Huh? - I've never heard of one. - Hm... Boogie, go do a search online. I did. There's nothing on the net. Wow. So how do we know one even exists? Oh, well, we should go back to the kingdom to find out some more. You're too young for this. Fear can slow the development of becoming a frog. Freddy! I'm a tadpole, what else would I become? And for a tadpole, I happen to be extremely smart. It takes more than a big ego to be a Frog Warrior. It takes skills and bravery. [chuckles] You're such a child. Do you mean, now, it is up to me? Hey, I'm a Frog Warrior, too! [Muscles] A Frog Warrior is never a coward. Huh? Hey! Wait for me! I don't wanna be a coward either! Hey! Well, at least they have a strong sense of duty. That's part of being a warrior, too! I'm a little worried. We should follow them. Thelma, let's go. [panting] Muscles! What kind of flowers do you want on your grave? [Muscles] Uh, white lilies! [merchant] Fresh, ripe fly! Great flying one! Great bug! Yummy! Everything seems to be fine here in the kingdom. I don't see anything wrong. Yeah, everyone seems okay, so I guess nothing happened. But we shouldn't assume that. I mean, you never know what could be going on behind closed doors. Hey, Freddy! Are you gonna go visit the princess? [Freddy] Probably not. I don't think that'd be a good idea. I don't see why not? You like her, don't you? Stop, Boogie! Please. Please don't mention it again. [Boogie] Look at that! The river is just as crystal clear as it always is. [loud rumbling] [all] Huh? What's going on? Earthquake! Run! [screaming] [woman] The tree, it's falling! Let's go! - [gasping] - [muffled yelling] Watch out! [crashing] - Thank you! - Boogie, watch over this kid! [squeaking] Good boy! Now, go destroy the village. Big bro. Okay, take this! [man] Shark missile! [patrons] Huh? Huh? Look! The Crystal Frog again! - Crystal Frog? - I want my mommy! - I'm not married yet... - Everyone, run, now! Or you'll be salted, crispy frogspawn! [screaming] Psst. Come on! [Freddy] The Big Four! Hmm. Well, what do you know, Freddy's back. The best prospect to be the king's son-in-law. - Didn't work out so well, huh? - Get out of my way! Ow! [groans] [Frog Princess] Hold it right there! [everyone gasping] Ah. Huh? Princess? Oh, Princess, why are you here? May I accompany you for a stroll? Eh? Bestie, go make sure all the wounded frogs are all right. Yes, Princess, I'm on it. Soldiers, to action! Princess, please don't trouble yourself. Taking care of those ungrateful frogs is my specialty. - Slime ball. - Disgusting. Uh... [no audible dialogue] Uh... Hello, Princess! You know, I just saw the Big Four. I'm pretty sure they're behind all of this. So, uh... Don't act surprised to see me. This is my kingdom after all. The one you ran away from last time you were here. What were you afraid of? Afraid? [scoffs] I'm not afraid of anything! You look really scary right now... In a good way! Princess, your royal image. You want to see something scary? - [soldier] Your Highness... - What? [whimpering] This is the flyer we've just picked up. [clears throat] [Frog Princess] It's the same flyer that has Father so concerned. They want that Crystal Frog. But I'm going to stop them! Listen to me, everyone! Don't be afraid. I will be sure to get to the bottom of this! Frogizens, don't worry! [cheering and applauding] [snickering] Tie him up and bring him with us. Wait! Princess... [struggling] I know the kingdom is in trouble. - I came back-- - Shut it! Too late to start talking now. Take him away! Your Majesty, I've brought the ancestral map to the holy land. According to the parchment, the route to the holy land is full of danger and one must cross deserts and rivers. According to our historical records, wishful treasure hunters went missing. No one knows where they are. - Hu Hu, are there any results? - Uh, not yet. But I'm concerned the Crystal Frog is under threat. Activate The Frog Warriors' plan at once! [gasps] It's urgent that we move immediately. But we're not ready yet! Are all the Frog Warriors assembled? Yes, they are waiting your command. But there is one frog... Freddy? He's the one I need! He's right here! Such a disaster of a frog, but I brought him back. [nervous laughter] Huh. Everyone is here, Sire. Presenting the Frozen Warriors squad! My faithful Warriors, the time has come to defend your country. I have an important mission for you. Our royal history holds a big secret. Long, long ago, frogs had no need to hibernate in winter. But surviving the chilly winter without food was a major concern. So our ancestors created a magical artifact, the Crystal Frog. It let us hibernate in winter and protected us from freezing cold. It's hidden in the mysterious holy land. The crystal balances our ecology. The gate to the holy land opens once every 100 years to absorb energy from the earth and sky. But that moment is the most dangerous. Should the Crystal Frog be removed from its holy sanctuary, its energy will dissipate, and the entire frog race will face extinction. [gasping] That's why we need to protect it. The one hundred year mark is approaching. There are many odd happenings of late, which suggests our secret has been divulged. If anyone wants to take the Crystal Frog away, we have to stop them! Warriors! You must leave immediately to the holy land to protect the Crystal Frog! [gasps] [grunts] [groans] [Freddy] Your Majesty, it's nice to see you again. Freddy, are you confident that you can lead the Warriors and complete the mission? Uh, before I answer that, just curious if the other Warriors ever returned? The holy land is dangerous. According to our historical records, not a single Frozen Warrior ever came back from the holy land. If you're unfortunate and fail to return, we'll publicly mourn for you, for three seconds. Freddy, I believe in you to lead the Frozen Warriors and rescue our kingdom. How would one get to the holy land? [sighs] [chuckles] Hm? What's this? This is the map that will lead you to the sanctuary in the holy land. I'll do this on one condition. That Ababwa joins us! Me? What? - [Frog King] You may. - Me? Once you enter the holy land, remember these... - Hm. - One frog to protect home. One red heart to stand firm. One chance to take. Humbleness is the only truth. I hope this riddle can lead you to Crystal Frog. Huh? How old-fashioned. Well, then, everyone can leave as soon as Ababwa is ready. Oh, no! [birds chirping] Freddy, will I get promoted to captain after this? I guess. Freddy, do you think you'll marry the princess after this? - It's anyone's guess. - Why guess? I mean, who is prettier than the princess? I guess! What's with all this guessing baloney? Why would the princess fall for some idiot like you? I can barely stand to even look at you! The Princess should be with me! [gasps] Ambush! Get ready! [all grunting] [Frog Princess] You know what I'm here for! [both] Huh? Huh? [Devo] It's the princess! [both sighing] Why such a long face? My Princess, were you looking for me? Hi, fancy meeting you here! [grunts] - [grunts] - [groaning] You sneaky coward, how did you escape the palace? Hm? Well, I didn't have to escape, I'm on an official top-secret mission. You're not only a coward, you're a liar! We really are on a mission. - Assigned by who? - The king. Liar! Hm? A mission to protect the Crystal Frog! I promise I'm not lying, I swear! Oh! [gasps] [Frog Princess] Father really did assign them to this mission. Yes, I'm aware of this top-secret mission. But why would he send you? - You're a proven coward! - Huh? [Frog Princess] What's gonna keep you from running away? Again! That's right. When the king assigned him this mission, he almost wet his pants. - Shut up! - Oh, I'm so sorry! Is this the frog afraid to be the king's son-in-law, who made a fool out of the princess? The news had been going viral for a whole year! [grunts] Yeah, you should be in prison! That seems a little bit harsh wouldn't you say? I mean, the kingdom's in trouble, let us Warriors complete our mission! [sighs] [yelps] [groans] Just to be sure this cowardly frog doesn't run away, I'm going with you! Huh? [chuckling] Hmph. What? The princess is missing? Perhaps it's possible that she's with Freddy. [panting] Your Majesty, no news about the flyer. Noggin, what perfect timing. The princess is missing! Huh? You must investigate her whereabouts and bring her back, bring her back safely. Yes, your Majesty! Smartypants, let's go! [groans] I'm starving. - You want a dried fly? - Trying to fool me again? - [laughing] - Hey! - Hey, give it back! - Gotta come and get me! Give it back, it's a limited edition! So full of energy. Give it back me! - Come on! - Whoa... Hey, it's a resort! Good, I'm ready for a vacation! Huh? [Freddy] Who designed this place? [Devo] Come on Muscles, hurry up! There's a resort ahead. [Freddy] Pretty fancy! - Oh... - [chuckles] Don't eat everything, leave some food for me! [Frog Princess] "Stick to Your Ribbits Resort?" [Devo] Yum, high protein food. Great for your skin! - It has everything! - [all gasping] Awesome! [Frog Princess] Hmm, why would there be a restaurant up here? Ta-da! Welcome to my restaurant where you'll eat until you croak! - [Muscles] It's him! - One-Eye? One-Eye 2.0, at your service! Please, a leopard can't change its spots! Now, let's not dwell on the past! You're looking at someone who's new and improved! I know that I've acted a little bit evil before, but I have metamorphized into a good frog. I'll make up for my previous very unfortunate behavior. Hmm... Something about what you're saying just has a whiff of insincerity. Sorry! That might just be the bean burrito. Hm... Nope. I know what I can do to convince you! I'm a nine-star chef! - Woo-hoo! - Nine? Yes, that's correct! I will conquer you with my cooking and then you will believe me! - Bring out the dishes! - Huh? [One-Eye] Voila! Yeah! [chuckling] Introducing my inspired appetizer, worm sushi. My guests, please enjoy. Bon appetite. Something's not right. I don't trust him. Oh, please, look who's talking. Me? I'm Mr. Sincerity! So, Muscles, there's some commotion at Frog Kingdom? Something about a Crystal Frog, maybe? Yes... [spitting] That's none of your business! And why would a chef ask so many questions? - [Freddy] Thanks, Ababwa. - [both] Huh? They say purple's the new black. [Frog Princess] Gross, you're dripping on me. So anyway, Muscles, where are you going now? We're going to protect the Crystal... That doesn't matter! Go on, serve the next course! [Muscles speaking indistinctly] Of course, you must be starving. - [buzzing] - Oh. [buzzing] Who needs a nap after all this eating? And now the piece de resistance, your Shangri-lodgings! [all] Whoa! A top of the line design, a jacuzzi tub, and a gym! Anything else I can do for you, please let me know! Maybe a personalized massage for you? Disgusting! [One-Eye] Princess, is that a yes? [chuckling] Ugh. [chuckling] [groans] Interesting. Looks like the Crystal Frog legend is real. [crickets chirping] [Frog Princess] Father, I promise to complete this mission. [chuckles] Huh... [sniffing] [gasps] [Noggin] I can smell the princess. Over there! You can't go! Hold back! Wait up! The princess is right here! [chuckles] Found by sheer luck, what I have always been searching for! Ah... - The Big Four? - So it was them! - What is that? - Our map! Our map? How come they have the map to the holy land? I don't know, but we have to steal the map back or the Frog Kingdom is doomed! - What are you doing? - Getting the map back! Let's go set our trap. Come on! Uh-huh. Noggin, there are four of them. It is too dangerous. Let me signal for backup. [Noggin] There's no time for that. So this is the legendary holy land map? Let me see it, boss. Come on, let me see it. Can you comprehend with your low IQ? [chuckles] Well, I just like the pictures. Hey, let me see the picture, too. Do you even know which way is up? Hey, can I have a look? [Bandito] Do you even get it? [Spidey] None of your business - May I take a peek? - I don't get it. [chuckles] Fortunately, the world is full of idiots. Huh? Hm? Hm? Who? Hi, boss. We, uh, we're just passing by. - Indeed! Yes! - It's Noggin! Get them! - [yelling] - Retreat! - Faster! - [Smartypants] I'm scared! I can't go faster! [whimpering] We're doomed if we don't run faster! Climb up! Stand back! I'm not afraid of you! Stop talking and climb! - Come on! - I'm coming! Where do you think you're going? [screaming] Hold on tight! I'm feeling dizzy! Let's sandwich them! Faster! [chuckling] You wanna join me? No, no, no, no, no! Don't do that! We'll climb down ourselves! You're in a hurry? Let me help you! [screaming] And he's out! - [Foofie] There he is! - Huh? Go get him! Where you going? Smartypants, over here! One, two, three, jump! Whoa! Noggin, where did you get the paraglider? You are witnessing my ingenuity. Convinced? Give up! The map is now with me! Laugh at us? Laugh at this! Whoa! - You can't hit me! - Then try this for size! - [Smartypants] Shark Missile! - Evasion tactics! What the...? - Huh? - Not good. [screaming] - [One-Eye] Princess! - [groans] [One-Eye] Princess! Princess! [gasps] [gasps] The map! [gasps] One-Eye must've taken it! [grunts] Freddy, wake up! [yawns] I'm awake. [screaming] The map's been stolen. [gasps] Had to be One-Eye. [Spike] They fell. Find them! [panting] Hey, over there! My goodness! Smartypants, return to the kingdom first with the map. - What about you? - I'll be a decoy. Otherwise both of us will get caught! - Be careful. - Stop talking! Go! [whimpering] Ow! You're in a hurry, huh? - Search him! - All right. One-Eye, don't waste your time. The map's long gone. [chuckles] If you think that dimwit can escape from us... [chuckles] Well, then you can think again! Take him away! Yes, sir! He stole it while I was asleep! I'm so stupid, I should've just stayed awake! That doesn't matter now, getting the map back is what's important! I knew I should've been the one to keep the map. - What a mess. - Seriously, Freddy? That's just wrong. - [buzzing] - [both] Huh? What does it want? That's fly language for, "I think I found something so you should follow me and find out!" Huh! [One-Eye] The entire kingdom will soon be mine, so you may want to stick by my side! You greedy, shameless frog. Stop daydreaming! Two aces! [chuckles] The map is very important to me. Then it's good that you don't have it! Oh, but look, what is this then? - The map? - Huh? Smartypants! What have you done to him? [chuckles] What haven't I done? [Noggin] Huh? Now that I have the map I can find the Crystal Frog and become king of the world! [chuckles] [panting] [buzzing] - Good job, Thelma. - I don't like the looks of that! Here, take care of Thelma, okay? Hold her nice and tight. Hey, over here! Well, I don't see anything unusual. I'll go check it out. - Huh? - Huh? [laughing] Don't play that card! He has a flush. - Trust me! - Hm? Not a chance! Flush! [laughing] [grunts] [gasps] Hm? [grunts] [whip cracking] Freddy, get me down! Ta-da! [groaning] Freddy, look at these drawings here. You see? It's the blueprints of One-Eye's plan. So, he's been working on this for a while, huh? He needed the map to the holy land. So he could steal the Crystal Frog! - What can we do? - [Freddy] Well, luckily the holy land isn't that easy to find. First of all, we have to find One-Eye and retrieve the map. It's right here! [chuckles] Come and get it! [chuckles] [gasps] Ah! Am I still as good-looking? Oh, look at this. An awesome catch! - Boss, the map! - Hmm. This was the missing piece to my perfect plan. And when the gate to the holy land opens in a few days, that Crystal Frog will be all mine. And I'll become the most powerful frog in the kingdom. - [laughing] - [grunting] It's not polite to stick out your tongue. [grunts] Freddy, don't worry, you're still good-looking. [chuckles] [One-Eye] Leave them to enjoy their final moments. - Let's go! - You can't do that, One-Eye! If anyone takes the Crystal Frog, the kingdom is doomed! [all] Huh? That sounds like the princess. - Huh? - Huh! It is her! Princess, what are you doing here? - Muscles! - You got to get us out of here, quick! - [lizard] Boss! - [all] Huh? They've escaped! [laughs] Don't worry, we can easily catch them again. [panting] This scene is like something from a movie. Strange. Mm. What the heck is he doing? - I dunno. - [One-Eye] Ladies and gentlemen! - Haha. - There he goes! Don't let him get away! [mocking] Haha. [panting] [grunting] [Muscles] Why is it so quiet? - [thud] - [all gasping] [all gasping] [gulps] [humming] Hi-ya! Who wants to see my new weapon? [laughs] [all gasping] What? What new weapon? Whatever he's got, we can beat it. Hey, it's shooting time! Okay, let's strike a pose! - Yeah! - All right. Seems like an odd time, but how's this one? Hm. Ugh! Run! [laughing] [explosion] [gunfire] [evil laughter] [gunfire] It's the ammo depot! Grab the weapons and return fire! Aim at the chariot! Huh? Fire! [all] Yeah! Agh! Ha-ha! Ugh! Boogie! Retreat! Ah, the little tadpole! [grunting] [screaming] Bro, here's your special delivery. Huh? - [explosion] - Ah! An exploding pine cone? Come on! [helicopter rumbles] Whoever invented these weapons is a genius. If I do say so myself! [laughs] It makes frog-killing fun. Stop bragging! Let's go! [One-Eye] Where is that unfinished frog? Watch out! [rock music] [laughing] [grunting] One-Eye! Huh? [gasps] [screaming] [panting] [Ababwa] Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark! Oh, no! One-Eye's gotten away! [grunting] Hm? The desert! A great place to trap them! [evil laughter] Boxer! Boogie! Escort them back! We'll go after One-Eye. [both] Yes, sir! No, I will escort them back! These two can't handle that! - Just do as I say! - Ow! Come on! [groans] [all] Huh? A desert? Well, that would explain the empty space on the map! - Look, footprints! - Hm? - One-Eye must have gone that way. - [all] Hm... - Follow me, come on! - Huh? Uh-uh. No, I'm not going! Not without a map! We could die out there! And the whole Frog Kingdom will die if One-Eye finds the Crystal Frog! Princess, look there! There's another trail of footprints. [Freddy] Huh. This way seems right! Princess, I have a really good plan. Noggin and I will follow the tracks. - You should stay here. - Are you kidding me? Do you know how dangerous the desert is? As princess, I can't let you take this risk alone. Besides, I lost the map. So I'm gonna get it back. But you're the princess! You'll be ruling the kingdom someday! How could I face the king if anything happened to you? - I won't let you guys go alone! - All right, let's split up. Noggin and I will follow him into the desert, and then you guys will follow the other footprints. Oh, yeah, good call! I'll be the princess's protector! Muscles, take care of the princess for me. - Okay. - Let's go, Noggin! [Frog Princess] Freddy, promise you'll return to me. - Let's go! - Huh? - Your Majesty. - Any word from the Warriors? Boogie has returned. And the princess? She... teamed up with the Warriors. [sighs] It seems the princess is one of them now. I hope they all return safely after the mission. [panting] All of the footprints are gone! [Noggin] That cunning One-Eye! Which way should we go? We can only trust our intuition. [exhausted panting] I can't go any further... - Noggin, keep moving! - I'm... so thirsty. Hang on a bit longer, there's got to be some water ahead. Come on. You're okay. Wait. - Huh? - I smell water. There's water ahead! Noggin! - Noggin! - Water, water! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? It's empty! Agh! I need water! It's all right, stay strong. Come on, let's go. - Freddy? - [Freddy] Yeah? Will we ever get back to the Frog Kingdom? I hope so. I wonder how the princess is. She really cares about you. Hm? Huh? Freddy. We must try to get back alive. And make sure we tell everyone our story. [Freddy] Princess, I hope you're okay. [Noggin] I'm the Frog Kingdom's greatest detective. I never thought I would end up here. Huh, Water? There's the smell of water coming from that way. This is no illusion. It's real! Hold up! Be real. We're in the desert. There's no water! It's not an illusion. Look over there. - What's that? - Huh? - It's an oasis. We're saved! - I'm the greatest detective! This case, it's a piece of cake! Yeah! [Noggin laughing] - [groaning] - [panting] [groans] I don't believe it. We've walked for days just to end up at the same spot. And now I'm seeing things, too. [Frog Princess] Freddy! [Freddy] Huh? Princess... Princess! Why did you come here? I told you not to. It's dangerous. Why are you here... Another illusion. Huh? Hey! Noggin, I have an idea! [groans] [grunting] And now we have a paraglider! This is my expertise. One, two, three, jump! Whoa! [both] Whoa! [panting] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We're flying now! - [thunder rumbles] - Look there! Seems like there's a storm ahead. Huh? A storm! Noggin, let's turn around! [Noggin] The storm's pulling us in! [thundering] [screaming] [thundering] [both] Whoa! [thundering] [grunting] [screaming] - Bring it up! - Why? [screaming] Sand dune ahead! We're going to crash! [Freddy] Whoa! Keep it balanced! Stop moving around! - [thundering] - Whoa! Freddy, I can't hold on anymore! Huh? [panting] - Huh? - Huh? Now I'm really confused. One-Eye just disappeared after several spins here. He can't just vanish into thin air. Something's up. [laughs] Nobody can save you. Take one step forward. - Huh? - [rumbling] It's a trap! [screaming] Muscles! Are you okay? I'm okay. [chuckling] Give me your hand! Be careful, princess. [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] - Princess! - Muscles, hang on! [yelps] Princess, leave me! Go and find a way to save yourself! Forget that! We're leaving together. [gasps] [grunting] [snarling] Princess, leave! [rumbling] [screaming] [Muscles] Huh? It's so dark! Where am I? Princess, where are you? - Princess? - I'm right over here. [grunting] [gasps] We've been swallowed by a crocodile! Huh? Princess, what is it? [rumbles] [grunts] Punch it! - [Muscles grunts] - [snarling] Bite it! [roaring] [Frog Princess screaming] Princess! Princess! [screaming] [groaning] - Muscles? - I'm okay. [Ababwa] Princess! Princess, I was so worried about you! You were able to escape this time. Dumb luck! Hm? Huh? [yelps] It's One-Eye! Let's get him! One-Eye? [groaning] Huh? Is this for real? [grunts] Noggin, are you okay? Wake up! Where are we now? [sniffing] Huh? [panting] I'm coming! Oh, yeah! The water's so cool! I'd be happy to stay here forever! [Frog Princess] Freddy! - Huh? - Noggin! - Princess! - [Frog Princess] Freddy! You're here. Ah. You're safe. [grunting] Princess, why are you here? Because One-Eye faked us out, he never entered the desert. Those footprints were just to mislead us. We chased him down, but then he disappeared again. We almost died out there in the desert. We almost died, too. Since One-Eye is gone, I think we should go home. Uh, yup, we've run out of clues. If we keep going, we're gonna die. I think we're all in agreement then! We can't leave now. Not while One-Eye is still a threat to Frog Kingdom. That's so easy to say, but how are we supposed to find him? We can't give up now, guys! We have to work together. Uh, I've no idea. Good luck with that. You're a terrible Warrior! And I'm going home. Ababwa, if you wanna go then leave! - I'm tired of all your threats! - Take it easy! Hey, you! I'm not your punching bag! Focus your anger on One-Eye. - It seems you just want to be humiliated. - [Muscles] It's okay. [Ababwa] I'll teach you a lesson today. - Noggin, you judge who's right. - [Noggin] I'm so exhausted! [Freddy] We can't give up! We have to catch One-Eye! [Ababwa] If you want to die alone, go for it. - I'm going home. - [Freddy] Go back on your own! - [Ababwa] Sure, I'll go! - [Freddy] Take it easy. Let it go. Come on, we're on the same side. [Ababwa laughing] - Stop it! - Hm? To save our kingdom we must do it together! We need to remain a team! If we do that, we can overcome any obstacle! Remember, the fate of Frog Kingdom is in our hands. So I ask you: Who's with me? Well, you know, I've always been a team player. Count me in. That's right. Princess, I'm with you. - You go home alone. - Huh? [whimpers] Wait for me! [all] For the Frog Kingdom, let's go! Huh? Look, there's a boat! - [Muscles] Strange. - [Frog Princess] Let's check it out. - Why a boat here? - Hm? Why is there a rope left here? - [Frog Princess] That's strange. - Yeah. I can smell it! [sniffing] One-Eye has gone that way by boat! - Noggin, we figured that out. - That's right! [Devo] Our boat waits for nobody. I checked the map. We're not far from the holy land. Beyond the desert is a river, but after that? I don't know! You're supposed to be the detective, Noggin. Didn't you study the map? The Princess may like you but she's going to choose me! Don't underestimate my pure, innocent heart. [Muscles] Pure? Innocent? Muscles, you've heard that love can make you stupid? Uh, if stupid means innocent, then you're super innocent. [both] Hm? Something's not right. Watch out, everyone! The current is speeding up! Huh? [screaming] Row backwards! A frog isn't afraid of water! You're not even afraid of waterfalls? [yelling indistinct] [all] Whoa! Whoa! [all yelling] Noggin! Noggin! Over here! Faster! Come on! - Noggin, hurry! - Give me your hand! [grunting] [Noggin] A giant whirlpool! [grunting] [Freddy] It's sucking us in! [all] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [yelling] Hold on! [screaming] [gasps] [Freddy] So, this must be the holy land. [gasps] [coughing] Princess, are you okay? - Hm? - Huh? [shivers] I'm freezing! [sneezes] The water here is super cold. Come on, let's get out! [grunting] Well, well, who have we here? [evil laughter] [both] One-Eye! You fools are like gum on my shoe. Too bad for you I'm not wearing shoes. That makes no sense at all! - It's a metaphor, you idiot! - It's a simile. - [One-Eye] A simile is a metaphor! - No way! All similes are metaphors but not vice versa! I'm lunch meat. [One-Eye] Now that's a metaphor! One-Eye, stop! Where am I? Oh, yeah, gotta get One-Eye! [groans] [ripping] Huh? [laughs] Whoa! [laughing] [grunting] [gasps] [Freddy] What is this? [Frog Princess] Noggin! Princess, stay back! [ice cracking] Whoa! My persistent little frogs. [laughing] Too bad, I wish you could join me here. But without the protective cloak... [laughs] ...things could get a bit frosty! You mean, one of these? Heh? Uh, that one's, defective! He's lying, put this on. Noggin? [muffled] Go. - We have to go. - But wait, what about Noggin? [sniffling] We'll save him after we find the Crystal Frog. Noggin would want it that way. [sniffling] [panting] Wow. Wow. Weird, right? A freezer full of monsters. Hm? [groans] [screaming] It's a two-headed thingamasaurus! Shh! How can she stay so cool? Well, it is negative 400 in here. [both] Whoa. Huh? [Ice Monster] The holy sanctuary of Frog Kingdom. Entry is forbidden! Whoa. What's happening? [grunting] [Freddy] We're breaking through! What is this? Huh? Is it one of those ice monsters? I don't like the looks of that! Huh? Princess, stand completely still! [gasps] Freddy! Whoa! Whoa! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - It's just a scratch. - Hey, look up there. - There's a gem on his head! - I know. - I just licked that thing. - How did it feel? Uh, very cold. [screaming] Jump! [Freddy screaming] - Ow. - Freddy! I'm okay, it's just another scratch. Come on! [gasping] I'm thinking that maybe his job is to protect the Crystal Frog. "One frog to protect home." [both] "One red heart to stand firm." Well, it looks like our friend is back. [gasps] [yelps] Wait for me! [screams] Huh? Freddy? Princess! [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [screaming] Huh? Run! [screaming] [screaming] [chuckles] [groans] Freddy, are you in there? [grunting] [gasps] Let go of me! [Freddy] Put her down! Hey, over here, why don't you come and get me! You big bully Ice Monster! I challenge you to fight me! [Frog Princess] Freddy! [gasps] [snarling] Hold on! Freddy! Hey! Listen to me! I'm the princess of Frog Kingdom. My dad, the Frog King, sent us to protect the Crystal Frog from a guy named One-Eye. He's trying to steal the Crystal Frog. Removing it from the holy land will destroy Frog Kingdom! That's why we're here. To protect it, like I know you're trying to do! Be on our side, don't fight us! You're the guardian knight! Beautiful story. Give me the gem! [Frog Princess] He's going after the gem. Stop him! [gasps] We want to help you protect the Crystal Frog but first we have to stop One-Eye! [snarling] Whoa! [chuckles] Hm? [gasps] Whoa! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Freddy! [screaming] [Ice Monster crashing] [grunting] Thanks, wow. I owe you one! [laughing] [grunting] [laughs] This is even better than I hoped for. [laughs] Hello, gorgeous! [laughs] Let's go! Princess, wait up! [screaming] [splashing] [Muscles] Where are we? There's Noggin! Noggin's ice sculpture. Like his cool twin brother. - No, don't! - Huh? Hey, where's Princess and Freddy? I don't know. Maybe they're inside. - Whoa. - Whoa. This place feels kinda creepy. I'm not sure why, but it does. You're right, I agree. Weird. Maybe that could have something to do with it. Yikes. [Frog Princess] So, the holy sanctuary should be in there. Okay, there must be a way to get inside. Maybe we can find a clue on the map. There must be a door. [grunting] [gasps] Hey, come back here! [gasps] - The gem! - Whoa. Huh? [nervous laughter] [both] Whoa. It's opening! [gasps] Looks like we found that door. Yeah, and the gem was the key. Game... ...over! - [laughing] - [choking] [Frog Princess] Freddy! Huh? [gasps] Out of my way! Looks like I'm gonna have the Crystal Frog. And you're gonna have the dead one! - [evil laughter] - [gasps] Freddy, wake up! [groaning] Princess, go on without me. - You go catch One-Eye. - No, I won't leave you. [grunting] Ah... Glorious treasure. [laughing] It's all mine. [laughing] Ooh. [laughing] I'm going to be a gazillionaire! [laughs] Princess, look. [gasps] "One chance to take. Humbleness is the only truth." Yeah, which means we have only one chance to get it right. [laughing] White jade! And oodles of rubies and sapphires. I'm rich! Huh? Oh! And gold, my favorite! Wealth and power is my middle name! Whoo-hoo! Hi, there! Precious babies. Who's your Daddy now? The Frog Kingdom is all mine! Everyone will bow before me! [evil laughter] Ow! [groaning] What's happening? - Huh? - Huh? No! What's going on? [gasps] [gasps] [Freddy] He's frozen solid! [gasps] [Ice Monster] Crystal Frog, life force to Frog Kingdom. Never to be removed from its original place. This is bad! The Crystal Frog must have been moved! Let's go! The door's closing! [grunting] [crashing] We'd better hurry and find the Crystal Frog before we turn into frogcicles too! Right! Princess! Let me! All right? 'Cause I'm a lucky frog. How else would I've met you, right? Freddy! If I was a Crystal Frog, where would I be? Huh? Must be that one! Looks crystal to me. Freddy, are you sure? I'm positive! [gasping] Huh? [grunting] [both screaming] What do I do? What do I do? [Frog King] As successor to the throne, why must you be so hot-headed? Stop acting like a child. Everything in life is like a coin. When you look at one side, you can't see the other side. Don't be concerned with appearances. Only with humility can one find the truth. One chance to take. Humbleness is the only truth. Humbleness, humility, that's the answer! And there it is! [grunting] No, I won't give up! [grunting] [yelps] [screams] [grunting] I've got to put you back where you belong. [gasps] - Huh? - You did it! [gasping] - Whoa! - [sighs] Huh? Muscles, I think we should go. We have no idea how long they will take. Get lost! You can just go cry to your mommy. - Wha...? - Huh? - Huh? - Ah! Noggin, you're alive! You're not frozen. - [Devo] Noggin's alive! - Princess and Freddy? They did it! Oh, yeah! Look at that! The Crystal Frog! We make a good team! So the guardian of our Frog Kingdom is just plain and boring. Huh, I guess I expected more. Well, we'd better put it back. [grunts] [laughing] Oh, no, it's One-Eye! I've logged a lot of miles for this frog. If you think I'm gonna leave it behind, you're mad! Stop him! Huh? Ah! [all] Ah! [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] You'll never get the Crystal Frog away of me! You can't keep it One-Eye, it will end us all! Wrong, it'll end you! [screaming] Help, help me! Just hold tight! [Frog Princess] Freddy, come help me! [grunting] Ah! Ah! [Freddy] I got you! Freddy, we've got it back! [One-Eye laughing] Give me the Crystal Frog or I'll smash you both to smithereens! You could go ahead and try but I'm here for one reason! And that is to save my kingdom, so I'm putting it back where it belongs and no one can stop me, especially you! [Freddy] I suggest you listen to her. Hmp! Huh? But, I... Darn it! Huh? [gasps] [Freddy] Wow. [gasps] Huh? Wealth is overrated. The secret must remain hidden. All who enter shall be forever frozen in the icy walls. One-Eye, run! Or you're gonna die here. Unless being an ice sculpture is your thing. Huh? Huh? [screams] [screams] Oh, no, the bridge is collapsing! Noggin, please, let's go! No! We've got to go get them. You're crazy! [Frog Princess] Noggin! Huh? It's them! It's the princess and Freddy. What? They're with One-Eye? - [yelling indistinct] - [Muscles] The bridge, is collapsing! Move faster! [Noggin] You're almost there, come on! Come on, you're almost there! - [Muscles] Faster! - [Noggin] You can make it! [screaming] [Frog Princess] Ah! [screaming] [screaming] [grunting] - [Freddy] One-Eye... - Huh? - Thank you! - Huh? Muscles, pull us up! [grunting] Are you all right? The Crystal Frog's back where it belongs. Frog Kingdom is going to be safe. [Muscles] When was the last time you took a bath, Ababwa? You stink! No, I'm a frog of high standing. Even without a bath, I don't smell. Oh! One-Eye, you're the stinky one. Muscles, you know I'm always fresh as a daisy! It's all him! Well, forgive me, being evil is hard work. I swear, I'll be a better, less smelly frog, really! Yeah, we've all heard that one before. - You don't mean it. - [chuckles] Really? I'm sorry, I'm trying to sound like I mean it. [Devo] Yeah, I don't believe him. As a frog, you really shouldn't be so greedy. Our stomachs are too small. We can't possibly drink a whole river. Yeah, a frog should be honest. [nervous laughter] Princess? How were you so sure that was the real Crystal Frog? Never judge a book by its cover. And learn to trust your instincts. So I should follow my heart? The best decisions are the ones you feel deep inside. Hmm. I'm feeling it. So, you'll stay with me, forever? [all] Huh? [water splashing] [Devo] Uh, Princess, Freddy he, uh... - Huh? - Huh? Ahh... [growling] [Frog Princess] Freddy, you cowardly frog! I should've locked you up when I had the chance! Freddy!
