This chip is going to change everything. Come in, Two. What is it, Blue One? (man on walkie-talkie) We got everything under control here but I do want to go on the record to say that I never liked it, not one bit. You've got your orders. Do your job and we'll be fine. Yeah, right. (doctor) In 60 seconds his heart rate will be high enough, then we can begin. ??? [explosion] [gunshots firing] Blue One, what's going on? We got company, Blue Team, east side. [gunshots firing] I need more time to implant the chip. (Blue Two) I don't care. Do something! Can't you see we're under attack here? ??? [gunshots firing] ??? (Blue Two) Do it now. If they get the chip it's all over. Blue One. ??? Protect the chip-- [explosion] [gunshots firing] You okay? You okay? (doctor) You're our only hope. ??? ??? (newscaster) Share prices continue to tumble. (newscaster #2) Lehman Brothers was forced to declare itself bankrupt. (newscaster #3) I think what we see in society today is a result of Christians being apathetic and complacent. (newscaster #4) The largest single point drop. (newscaster #5) Many are selling everything, even at a loss just to get out of the market. (newscaster #6) Many put high on their list, but is the Christian faith now losing ground in America? (newscaster #7) Unity is collapsing under the pressure, leading only to chaos and confusion. (newscaster #8) The uncoordinated moves by European leaders has added uncertainty. (newscaster #9) Demonstrators are angry about the government's handling of the country's economic crisis and soaring unemployment. (newscaster #10) The percentage of people who call themselves Christians has dropped by 10% in a generation. (newscaster #11) Stock exchange dropped more than a heart-stopping thousand points in early trading. Its biggest drop ever. (newscaster #12) The prime minister is now facing a motion of censure in the parliament from the opposition, which claims soldiers used excessive force. (newscaster #13) Many Christians believe it's the wake-up call. Hundreds gather to pray for America and the faith. (newscaster #14) These vicious battles were breaking out across the city. (newscaster #15) Around the world, stock markets continue their terrifying plunge. (newscaster #16) More violence remains a distinct possibility. (newscaster #17) With the economic woes of America and the economic woes of many other economies in the world, the great push is going to be toward a global, one-world-- (newscaster #18) --place a microchip under your skin. It's all there. Science fiction 20 years ago, but a biometric reality today. (newscaster #19) The Avanti Corporation announced today it has begun testing its first human implant. (newscaster #20) Just announced this week that he wants to see a new financial condition in the world and he also says, "I want to see a one-world government led by a one-world leader." ??? (male) It wasn't what you thought it was gonna be. Okay, so you're dying. I mean at least you're done with it, you know? Yeah, but that's not what it's about though. Well, what is? I mean, you served your country, and honorably, I might add. I took a bullet and I got a little purple heart. For God and country? (Blue One) Well, I'll tell you one thing, I didn't see a whole lot of God over there. And don't talk to me about the Lord works in mysterious ways. I don't want to hear that. You know everybody has their own purpose in life, Chad, and everything happens for a reason. It's all part of the big picture, man. What big picture? When he reveals it, then we'll know. Little brother, you got your God and you got your religion and I respect that, I really do, but that's not the real world. ??? Welcome back. Name's Cooper. I work for Avanti, the company that hired your team to run security for us. What happened? I'm still a little bit foggy. (Cooper) What happened is you just became a very valuable man. So what am l, Superman now? (Cooper) Sort of. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, Mr. Turner, but it did. Because of that, you're able to earn in one job what might take your entire career. Okay, I'm listening. The G20 Summit happens in Berlin next week. I need that chip to arrive there safely. So you need to get me there safely. You and that chip are connected, forever linked. So what's the plan? Commercial flight in 2 days. We hide in plain sight. ??? ??? (male newscaster) This is the most authoritative accounting to date of Lehman's collapse, and pretty much of any firm that experienced the trauma-- (female) This way Mr. Pike. (male newscaster) What were the biggest surprises to you? ??? I am the way... And the truth and the life. Do you know how many languages are spoken today? No, but I'm sure you're about to enlighten me. There used to be one: grunting and hand signals. Primitive, but it worked. Now there's over a hundred, hundred different ways to say the same thing. Does it make any sense to you? Change is the nature of life. Mankind will always do what it needs to ensure its own survival. But that's just it. It's not working. It's falling apart. Too many nations, too many currencies, too much fighting and too much sickness. Masses are beginning to rally against hunger, unemployment, and poverty. Everything is out of balance. Something has to change. The world is in chaos, or religiously they'll see it as the end of the world and other gibberish like the Rapture. Obviously, the world is in desperate need of a savior and I have the answer. I intend to be that savior. I have no interest in your politics or your opinion. The only thing that concerns me is that I successfully complete the job you pay me to do. So what is it you need from me? A new technology has emerged, a microchip designed by the Avanti Corporation. I offered to buy it. They refused. It's being transported by plane from Bangkok to Berlin. I want you to bring it to me. You know my price. I want 50% upfront. And I'm gonna need 500,000 euros for operating costs. All taken care of. Here's your mark. ??? I'll be in touch. ??? ??? (airport employee) Sir? Sir? We need to scan you. (male on intercom) Flight 11 now boarding at gate 5. ??? (female flight attendant) Thanks, Dao. See you on board. Good evening, nice to see you again, Mr. Turner. (Chad) Oh, hey, Dao. How've you been? It's good to see you, too. Are you gonna see your father? No, actually I'm just here doing some business. ??? (airport employee) Okay, sir, you're clear. So you gonna be first class, right? (female flight attendant) Dao. I think I have to go now, so I'm gonna see you on board. (male on intercom) Flight 11 now boarding at gate 5. (female flight attendant) He's cute, Dao. Who's that? (captain) Welcome aboard Flight 417, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be flying at 30,000 feet and it will take roughly 12 hours to get to Berlin. We hope you'll enjoy the flight. Thank you for flying Transpacific Airways. What would you like to drink? (female passenger) Nothing for me, thanks. And for you, Mr. Turner? Pineapple juice, thank you. (Dao) What can I get you to drink, sir? (male passenger) Oh, yes, coffee please. (Dao) Coffee. ??? [knocking on door] (co-pilot) Hey, where's Jen? Oh wow, nice to see you too, Ted. (captain) You're gonna have to cut him some slack tonight, darling. (Dao) Why? No! Show her, Ted. Here it is. Wow, that is beautiful. Where? When? Details, details. Well, you're not gonna do it during drink service, I hope. No. No, no. Well, I thought I would take her for a moonlight stroll, ending up at that bridge, you know the one that she loves in East Berlin? Sounds perfect. Yeah? I hope so. Why can't I meet someone decent here. (captain) Hey, I introduced you two first. - That is true. - True, lost your chance. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Okay, I'm out of here, boys. Remember, mum's the word. Hey there, Dao, how are you? Hello again, Mr. Turner. Same thing as last time? (Chad) Please. Long flight, huh? Thank you. So, how long ago did he die? It's been years now. Time really doesn't make a difference though, does it? Excuse me. ??? You still serving? Yes, what can I get you? What do you got? Pineapple juice. Ooh, yummy. That sounds good. I'll have what he's having. Sure. (female) So, you and your buddy over there take this route often? My buddy? Yeah. I don't know what you're talking about. Sure you do. Guy over there, sitting right behind you. ??? ??? You like her, don't you? Who? Her, Day-o. It's Dao. (female) Oh. ??? That way. I'm Jodi, by the way. (Chad) Chad. So you guys are with Avanti, aren't you? You and your buddy over there that keeps looking over, the one you're not with? It's my job to know when people are hiding something. I'm guessing you're what, security? What are you, a detective? Journalist. (Chad) Ha, I should have known. There. We're in. Good. You got 5 minutes. (Jodi) So you want to know how I know you're with Avanti, Chad? (Chad) I'm just dying, Jodi. (Jodi) Your buddy's watch. Last year Avanti's top 20 executives were awarded an $80,000 Patek Philippe watch, and your buddy over there, he's wearing one. Hmm, all that really proves is that you need to get yourself a hobby or maybe-- maybe a boyfriend? (Jodi) Both true facts, but far from the point. The point is I know that the G20 Summit is next week in Berlin, and I know that Avanti is supposed to make some kind of big announcement there. So I'm willing to bet that that is where you are going. ??? Radios. ??? Hurry, up, Jiri. ??? So Cap, where did you get engaged? It was after a single's volleyball game and we were in the back of a Volkswagen Bug. - No way. - Yeah. That's not very romantic. No, I'm not very good at that. You know Jen's a Christian. Yeah, of course. How are you gonna handle that? Yeah, I know. I guess we just, you know, we don't really talk about it. You should talk about it. You think so? I do. Hmm. I'm gonna get a coffee. (captain) Give her a kiss for me. - I will. - And get me a ginger ale. Okay. Don't you see what's happening? This Summit is just a smokescreen for what's really going on. All right Jodi, why don't you tell me what's really going on. Our financial system is collapsing into a global power-grab by the wealthy bankers, the politicians, and big business. Think European union, only much bigger. The entire world under a single currency, a single bank, and eventually, a single leader. Are we talking about Satan? ??? Here, go back up. So you have read the Bible. Yeah. Then you know how this lays out. You gotta admit, this looks a lot like the beginning of the end; it looks a lot like the Tribulation. Look, to me, it's just another book. How can you say that? Because I live in reality. Excuse me. ??? ??? Hurry up! Hurry up! Oh, hi Ted. Are you lost? Cockpit's that way. No, I actually I was just-- Dao, do you know where I can get anymore of the-- Oh, hi! Hi. Okay, I'm out of here. ??? (Mr. Pike) Well, hurry up. We're behind schedule. ??? (Jiri) I've reached the avionics. I'm going in. ??? - Your newspaper. - Well, thank you, sir. Excuse me, would you like something to drink? - Coffee, please. - Okay. [screaming] (Cooper voiceover) What happened is you just became a very valuable man. (Jodi voiceover) I know that the G20 Summit is next week in Berlin, and I know that Avanti's supposed to make some kind of big announcement there, so-- ??? (Dao) All right, you two, who's flying the plane and who's tending to the passengers? No, he didn't! Isn't it beautiful? Oh! (Ted) What? I couldn't wait. What do you want from me? It was burning a hole in my pocket. It's absolutely gorgeous. - Thank you. - Congratulations, guys. (Dao) Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. No, no, don't! We are currently cruising at 34,000 feet and flight time is approximately-- ??? ??? ??? Altimeter set. All right. Just wait for my signal. - Oh, excuse me. - No problem. I just got engaged. Yes, congratulations. Thanks, I'd give you a cigar but it's a non-smoking flight. - Isn't that for a baby? - What? A cigar. Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, no, we're not there yet. - Did I hear engagement? - Yeah, it just happened. (male passenger) That's great. Hey, I'm an ordained minister if y'all want to get it out of the way here on the plane. - Excuse me. - Oh, yes, of course. Yeah, you know what? I don't think that she would go for that, like, at all, but thank you. (Chad's brother voiceover) You know everybody has their own purpose in life, Chad. And everything happens for a reason. All life has meaning and purpose. It all does. You know the Bible says, "Blessed are those who read and hear the prophecy and take it to heart because the time is near." Little brother, I seen the horrors of war. I watched a 12-year-old girl take a bullet, died right there on my arms, okay? Why would God let an innocent child die like that? The death of a child is-- it's always a tragic event, man, it always is. But let me guess, you got an answer for me, right? 'Cause you always have an answer for everything. No, not everything. This one, I think I do. - Really? - Yeah. Enlighten me. ??? You know, I believe the child's purpose was to ensure that you survived. She took that bullet that was meant for you in order for you to live out your purpose in life. ??? Oh, I didn't see you there. Can l, help you with something? ??? Ah, ginger ale. ??? ??? - Looking for something, Ted? - Oh, hey Dao. Uh, yeah, ginger ale for the Cap. (Dao) Oh, it's back there. Hang on. Jennifer? Jennifer, you back there? Let me just go get a few, okay? Okay, thanks. ??? Stop that flight attendant. (male) Excuse me. The thing is my seat, it won't go back. (Ted) Hey. Evening. Just got engaged. Hey, that's great. Who's the lucky lady? Stewardess, maybe you've seen her. She's brunette, big smile, beautiful. Can't say I have, but congrats anyway. Thank you. ??? Change of plan. ??? Activate jammer. (captain) Ted, you back there? Hey, Cap. Seem to be having trouble with the ginger ale. (captain) We seem to be having problems with the radio. You better get back up here. (Ted) Aye-aye. You are the air marshal, right? I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. I know you're armed so you're either the air marshal or a real problem. ??? When the cockpit door opens, we'll move. Steady. [knocking on door] Steady. Cap? (man on walkie-talkie) You got trouble. ??? (air marshal) Sir, can I talk to you for a second? [gunshot fires] Stop him. [passengers screaming] Get down! [gunshots fire] Nobody move. Stay in your seat! Everybody, stay in your seats and shut up. ??? ??? (Mr. Pike) Everybody report. Is the plane secure? (hijacker) Coach is secure. Co-pilot just had a little accident, but he's about to help me get into the cockpit. Get 'em out of here. Get up! Let's go! Now, up! [passengers screaming] Now! Now! Let's go! Captain won't open the door. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, that's right. And I know him. But you don't know me, do you? Jiri? You still there? I'm here. What happened? (Mr. Pike) Yeah, there's been a little setback up here. I need some explosive up here ASAP. Hang on, let's see if we can do this the easy way first. [screaming] (Mr. Pike) Quit your whining, you ain't gonna die. Move! Move! [passengers screaming] (hijacker) Don't move! (Mr. Pike) Ted Scott. It is Ted, right? You do realize that with or without your assistance, I am gonna get into this cockpit. From Jiri. Captain, have I got your attention? You see this? This is a high-powered gelatin explosive, strong enough to blow this door off of its hinges. Now, that's the good news. The bad news is it might take out most of us at the same time. So I suggest you open this door if you want to stop anybody else from getting hurt. Now unless you cooperate, people out here are gonna start dying. ??? Anybody inside? (Mr. Pike) Has anyone found the mark? (hijacker) No, sir. We're still looking, but there's no sign of him. That's impossible. ??? Graham, go get one of the flight attendants, now. Is there anywhere else on this plane somebody could be hiding? I said, is there anywhere else on this plane someone could hide? No, no, there's nowhere else. - What is it? - Our package has gone missing. He may have joined you down there. Captain? This is the captain. Who is this? This is the man that's taken over your plane. Listen, I'm the captain and I'm still in control of this plane. For now. You follow a few simple of instructions, it will stay that way. ??? (captain) I don't want anyone getting hurt. ??? No one's getting hurt. I just need you to change altitude. ??? I'm not flying this plane into any building. I'm a businessman, Captain. Not a suicide bomber. Look, this is the easiest choice you're ever gonna have to make in your life. ??? You do it and I won't be forced to kill anybody else. Anyone else? ??? [screaming] Oh, I'll kill you! It was unavoidable. Oh, no! Look, Captain, you're gonna do as I say. ??? ??? He wants to talk to you. Captain, I'm sorry. I found the package. You want me to send it off. (Mr. Pike) Just make sure he's secure. Well, I got what I came for, now it's up to you. The only thing left to do is to shake it up a bit. What? And you know what I mean, shake it up. Now! [passengers screaming] ??? [passengers screaming] ??? Jennifer! (Mr. Pike) And I want the lights on. Captain, can you please level out the plane. (captain) Did it work? Did it work? Yeah, it worked, Captain, but now I'm mad. ??? Get down! Get down in your seats! [passengers screaming] Hook this up so I can talk to the passengers. Hook this thing up so I can talk to the passengers! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry about the turbulence. I can assure you it won't happen again, 'cause if it does, I will kill each and every one without hesitation. Do I make myself clear? Graham, get these two out of here. Jenson, get to work on those explosives. I want this door open now. Jiri, are you there? What's going on? Jiri, talk to me. What's going on? Something's wrong. Get down to the cargo hold, yeah? Find out what's going on. Jiri? Jiri? (Jenson) Jiri is nowhere to be found. I'm sure he's dead. ??? (Mr. Pike) You down there in the cargo hold. ??? You take one of mine, I'll take one of yours. ??? No! No, no, no, no, no! Shoot me. How pathetically noble. All in good time, Mr. Scott. No, no! No! No! No! No! No! [gunshot fires] [passengers screaming] Get her out of here. ??? ??? (Mr. Pike) I'm sending you down company, Chad. Your friend from the bar. ??? ??? Talk to him. I said talk to him. Chad, this is Dao. Can you hear me? Chad? (Mr. Pike) You got something I want. If you don't bring it up here in 5 seconds, I'm gonna put a bullet in this pretty little flight attendant's head. Five... four... three... two... Hold it! (Mr. Pike) So you're the one giving me all these headaches. I believe you have a knife. I'll take that. Give me the knife. ??? (Chad voiceover) Hey, Jeremy. We got company, Blue Team, east side! ??? So what am I, Superman now? (Jeremy voiceover) She took a bullet that was meant for you so that you can live out your purpose. (Jodi voiceover) The entire world under a single currency, a single leader. (Jeremy voiceover) I know you don't understand that, but one day you will. When the time comes, God will reveal his plan for you. (Cooper voiceover) You and that chip are connected, forever linked. (Jeremy voiceover) All you have to do is just accept his love with an open heart. He will... reveal his plan to you. Mr. Turner? Mr. Turner? I can't find what I came here for. (Chad) Yeah. Yeah, well, how's that my problem? (Mr. Pike) Because I have it on good authority that you have in your possession that which I am looking for. I don't know what you're talking about. (Mr. Pike) Sure you do. And if I don't get what I came for, I'm gonna start shooting these passengers, starting with her. (Chad) She's not a passenger. (Mr. Pike) She is now. All right, wait. Just-- You're not gonna find what you're looking for. (Mr. Pike) Why? It's in your checked luggage? It's not in my luggage. It's not on me. It's in me. Come again? It's an implant. (Mr. Pike) It's functioning? Yeah. Well, that's even better. - What are you gonna do? - What am I gonna do? I'm gonna cut it out. Too bad you killed the only one of us with any kind of medical training. (Cooper) I wouldn't do that if I were you. And just who might you be? I work for the company that hired Mr. Turner. He's the first completely successful human implant. It won't do you any good to cut him up. Then I'll just cut off the whole hand. That certainly won't work. (Mr. Pike) What will? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? (Cooper) The chip is biometric. It's fueled by his own blood supply. If you try to remove it in any way, it will release a deadly neurotoxin, killing him instantly. ??? (Mr. Pike) Bollocks. You expect me to believe that? (Cooper) I don't expect anything but if you do kill him, the chip will shut down effectively killing itself. Whoever hired you didn't tell you much, huh? It's back to plan B. You, watch him. You, get him out of here. (Mr. Pike on intercom) Captain, are you there? You said you weren't gonna kill anyone else. (Mr. Pike on intercom) That was a separate matter. You should be more concerned about the other passengers right now. I've got what I came for. You play your cards right, I'll be out of here shortly. What is it you need me to do? I need you to descend to 5,000 feet. (captain on intercom) All right, but I can't guarantee what the turbulence will be at that altitude. Well, then you better start praying. Get the blankets, put them over that passengers' head. Get that flight attendant to help you. It's not quite been your day, has it, mate? (hijacker #2) All right, put it over your head. Cover yourself up. Cover yourself up. Come on. Come on. [whispering] I think they're getting off. ??? Getting off the plane? In midair? (hijacker #2) Hey, shut up! No talking! They're taking this detour and jumping off the plane. Why do you think we're descending? (male passenger) But the stewardess said that we-- (Cooper) I don't care what the stewardess said. For all we know, she's one of them. What gives you the right to decide to put us all in jeopardy? I don't know where you been, buddy, but we're already in jeopardy. Be quiet. Hey. Do you have a plan? Yeah, kill the hijackers, take back the plane. (male passenger) Maybe we should ask other passengers. (Cooper) Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Most of these people don't even speak English. ??? (Chad) You must feel like a pretty big man, killing innocent people. ??? ??? Hey! I said no talking! ??? Captain. What's going on? We're down to 18,000 feet. It's getting bumpy. Explosives ready. The cabin door is now rigged with explosives, so don't try anything stupid. You take me down below 10 and keep it steady. I got a precious cargo back here. Arlo? Arlo? Arlo? (Mr. Pike) Where's Arlo? I don't know. (Mr. Pike) Well, he doesn't just disappear. Go find him. Arlo. Arlo, where are you? Arlo? You gotta distract this guy. I've got blood all over me. ??? Hey, hey, where are you going? I gotta use the bathroom. Sit. Look, if I'm going to die, I don't want to die in a puddle of-- I said get back in your seat. (male passenger) Come on, man, what's the harm? I said sit back down! What's going on? He want to go to-- He has to go where? To the bathroom. (Mr. Pike) He has to go to the bathroom. I'm sorry, nature calls. I'm sorry too. [gunshot fires] ??? ??? [gunshot fires] ??? ??? [explosion] [passengers screaming] ??? [abrupt silence] [alarm blaring] [passengers screaming] [panicking in foreign language] ??? Captain. Captain, it's Dao. You can open up now. It's all clear. You can open up. Why don't you try the intercom? I'm gonna go see what's going on with the passengers. ??? You had that coming. I'll take that for the company. Before that chip, Chad, you are nothin'. You don't know how lucky you are. Lucky. I didn't ask for any of it! Maybe you didn't, but that chip has the power to change the world. It's a symbol of freedom. You are the future of mankind, Mr. Turner. Yeah? It would have been nice if I had the choice. [passengers screaming] What's going on? Okay, everybody, just try to calm down, okay? Calm down. What's going on? What did the captain say? I couldn't reach him on the intercom. Is the intercom broken? I mean what--? No, I checked. It's working. It's just the clothes left behind. It's nothing but piles of clothes where people used to be. (Jeremy voiceover) All life has meaning and purpose. It all does. I know you don't understand, but one day, you will. Let me call you a cab. When the time comes, God will reveal your plan to you. ??? [tires screeching] ??? (Jeremy voiceover) You know the Bible says, "Blessed are those who read and hear the prophecy and take it to heart because the time is near." ??? (minister) They just vanished. There are dozens of passengers missing. How is that possible? I don't know. I don't know! Just try to--try to keep these people calmed down. It's the Rapture. I always thought that I was a good enough person with all that I was doing for the Lord. Now, I realize that just doing good does not secure a place for us in heaven. I never fully accepted that 'til now, even though I preached it for years. God has taken those that believe in him. Where are the missing passengers? (male passenger #2) I want to see the captain. What about my husband? Did he believe in the Bible and its teachings? (hysterical woman) Why are you asking me this? Did he? He did. Everybody listen... All we need to worry about is getting this plane safely on the ground, nothing else. Look, a blast like that can just bring the plane down. We survived the last blast, didn't we? We were lucky. (Ted) Not only that, there's something else you should know. We're headed back to Bangkok. Why is that? (Ted) It's protocol in emergency situations. I could tell the captain turned the plane back to Bangkok when we tried to retake the plane. All right, well, how long 'til we reach Bangkok? (Ted) About 30 minutes. Then we're wasting time. One thing's for sure. We do nothing, this plane goes down. (Ted) You don't know that. Come on, the captain could be passed out. He could still come-to. We can't count on that. Our only option is to blow the door. I got a better suggestion. (Cooper) We have to act right now. Time is everything. What do you think? (Dao) There may be another way. ??? (Chad) All right, I'm in. Okay, look for the door in the forward bulkhead. I don't see anything. Okay, well, maybe it got damaged in the blast. Can you feel around? There should be some cold air coming through. Cold air's coming from over here somewhere. All right, I got it. (Dao) Okay, good. Can you get in? It looks like the explosion jammed it shut. Looks like we're gonna have to blow the door after all, like I said. (Dao) No, wait, wait. Okay, Chad, listen. There are two seams in the bulkhead, one on either side of the plane. Can you just see if either one of them is torn or ruptured? (Chad) Probably gonna need some kind of a crowbar, tool of some kind. I'll see if l can find something down here. (Ted) No, nah, nah, nah, nah, passengers can't bring anything like that on a plane anymore. I don't see anything. Do you have any tools up there? Well, yeah, in the cockpit. Everything we have now is plastic. (Cooper) Yeah, even the plastic explosive. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got all the tools you need right here. If l can get down there with a couple other strong guys, we'll pull that bulkhead right off the wall if that's what it takes. ??? ??? ??? The fire melted the seam of this thing. I just can't-- You wanna give it a shot? ??? ??? Got a little light? Chad? What's going on down there? Shh! Chad? Chad? (Chad) Dao, pry-bar snapped. Maybe the only way to do this is to blow the door. What's he saying? Tell him he's running out of time. He's running out of time when the captain says he's running out of time! Chad? (Chad) I don't know what else to do. I don't have any more options. (helpful male passenger) You've had a rough day. Yeah, sure wasn't what I was expecting when I was shaving this morning. Yeah, me neither. Hey. I just want to say thanks for everything you've done. You've got us this far. (helpful male passenger) You think that's really what happened, all those folks, that it was the Rapture and those that believe in Jesus Christ were taken and the rest of us were left behind? There is no other explanation. It's impossible. And the only one that can do the impossible is God. ??? Hey, I have faith we can do this together. I could use a little faith right now. Dao, we're going in. We're gonna do this. Okay! They can do it! He's got 10 minutes. Alright, let's get these boxes out of the way. I've got an idea. ??? All right, let's ram this. One... two... three! ??? (Chad) I'm in. ??? ??? (Chad) Man, it is freezing in here. They have to keep the avionics cold so it's gonna be a little tight, all right? Okay, you're gonna have to crawl between the instrument racks towards the nose. Almost all the way to the front of the plane should be a hatch to the cockpit; on it should be a handle with a latch. Turn it and press upwards. ??? Has he reached the cockpit yet? Chad? Chad, what's going on down there? Found the hatch, but it's not budging. You think this thing could be locked from the cockpit? Come in, people. Can you hear me? - I'm going back down there. - Wait, wait, wait! Chad? Chad, you're just gonna have to find another way. (Cooper) We have another way. Chad, you're running out of time. (Chad) Give me 5 more minutes, okay? Five more minutes. What for? Five minutes, please? Not a second more. (Dao) Okay. All right, Chad, what do you need? Does anybody up there know what kind of cooling system the avionics runs on? On the newer planes with more advanced electronics, they run liquid cooling systems now. It's possibly liquid nitrogen. Yeah, gotcha. Chad, what are you doing? (Chad) I'm just gonna try a little college experiment. We've got a problem down here. Chad, what's going on? I think I found a radio jamming device. (Ted) Hey, hey, hey, hey, whatever he does, do not disconnect the liquid nitrogen pumps, okay? Those high-powered CPUs will start to overheat and they're gonna overtake the plane's entire navigation and guidance systems. - Chad? - Three minutes. ??? Three thousand feet. What? Wait, what did you say? Ted says whatever you do, don't disconnect the liquid nitrogen pumps. Chad? Lord, give me strength. Did you hear me? Chad? [warning alarm blaring] Chad? [passengers screaming] [warning alarm continues] Is everybody okay? Are you okay? Everybody okay? We're gonna blow that door, now. Wait. Chad? Chad, this is Dao. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, I just want you to know that we all still believe in you and you're gonna walk through that door any minute now. Blow that door now! (Dao) But if you can't, I'm praying that we're gonna make it through this. Okay, I don't know why you're not answering me but I assume there's a really good reason and you're gonna walk through that door any minute now and if you just-- Chad, if you can hear me, I'm gonna blow that door. No! ??? Everybody step back. Step back. Get back behind the partition. ??? Okay, I've got it set for 2 minutes. ??? ??? On the count of three. One... two... three! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's Chad. Okay, it's Chad. (Chad) Hey, Cooper. Have a little faith. Can you just go ahead and remove that bomb so he can get through? ??? Good for you, pal. But I wouldn't be celebrating just yet. You're freezing. (Cooper) We still got a plane to land. Let's do it. The Rapture. All right, how's it looking? Okay, she's okay. (male on radio) Thirty-five people missing from my flight. It's not possible. Entire east end of Bangkok is on fire... Tokyo is burning out of control... Looters swarming through the streets of Singapore. (Dao) So it's true. It's really happening. Well, at least we're safe. No, no, no, we're not. We still got a bomb to take care of. There's a bomb attached to an altimeter, and it looks to me as if we go below 3,000 feet that it's gonna blow. They teach you how to disarm those things in flight attendant school? (Dao) Well, they did actually. I was sick that day. (Cooper) Why can't we just toss it out, I mean toss it out of the plane? Is that-- is that possible-- I mean, what do you think? Well, in theory it could work. If l get the plane below 8,000 feet, depressurize the cabin, you go down below, open the rear cargo door, throw it out. By the time we hit 3,000 feet, the bomb will be triggered, we'll be miles away. Can we fly with the door open? (Ted) Well, technically you can land a plane with the door open so-- Well, I don't think we should let the passengers know though. They've been through a lot of trauma already. (Ted) That's okay, I'll tell them I have to depressurize the plane as a safety precaution before we land because of the explosion. How are we gonna get a bomb down through the passenger cabin without anybody knowing it? I can take care of that. ??? ??? (Ted over intercom) Ladies and gentlemen, as a safety precaution, we'll be depressurizing the plane during our descent, so please fasten your seatbelts. [passengers applauding] Be right back. Cheer up, Mr. Turner. You're a part of something that's on the verge of changing the world. Don't forget that. Hey, hey, hey. Listen, this chip. It's not a good thing for the world like he says. I can feel it. This doesn't feel like God's work. It feels like something else. What do you mean? I know this sounds crazy, but the chip... it's in the Bible. It's the mark of the beast. ??? (Dao) All right, Ted, we're in now. (Chad) We gotta get this thing out of here before we hit 3,000 feet. Okay. I'm gonna open the door. Go ahead and open it up. Hold on! Hold on! ??? You two make a good team. Okay, Ted, the bomb is gone. We're all clear. What are you doing? I'm done. I don't want to be a part of any of this anymore. (Cooper) Doesn't matter what you want. I've got a job to do and that's to deliver you as planned to the G20 Summit. (Chad) I'm afraid I can't do that. You don't have a choice, pal. (Chad) You're not gonna shoot me. You need me and you need the chip. You're right. I do need ya. But I don't need her. You make one false move, I will shoot her. Got it? Throw the chutes out, both of them. That one, too. ??? (Cooper) I don't want you to get any crazy ideas about jumping. ??? Oh! ??? ??? ??? ??? Let him go! Let him go now! ??? ??? ??? ??? It's okay. We're okay. ??? Where do you think you're gonna go? My guys are waiting on the ground at the airport on the ramp. You'll never make it off this plane. I've already delivered you. You're just too dumb to realize it. (Chad) Yeah, you're the one who's all trussed up like a pig on a spit. How you gonna explain to your boss how that happened to a smart guy like you, huh? (Cooper) Go ahead, jump. You're chipped. I'll find you. But if you jump, know this: She goes to prison for the rest of her life. She'll be arrested as soon as we land. Aiding and abetting a fugitive, interfering with a federal officer, theft of government property, conspiracy. She'll spend the rest of her life in prison. But if you stay... we're all heros. We'll be rich. What happened up here, all those people disappearing, if that was the Rapture, then this chip has a whole new meaning and I'm not gonna let it fall into the wrong hands. I'm out of here. ??? I'm going with you! How romantic. You've got one parachute, there's two of ya. You jump out there, you'll both die. Tell the captain we're getting off early. Ted, you're gonna have to land this thing with the door open. We're getting off early. ??? I will find you, Mr. Turner. No matter where you run, I will find you and I will bring you back. You know what? You were right. We do make a good team. Ready? [Dao screaming] ??? ??? (Mr. Pike) You lost him, didn't you? ??? (female newscaster) Global confusion is unfolding at this hour as reports are flooding in from around the world. Tens of thousands of people are missing, many of them are children and without explanation. Adding to the chaos, a rash of extreme natural disasters has blanketed areas around the world. Reports of tsunamis, earthquakes, violent storms struck every continent. Government and scientists have offered no concrete answers, and officials are racing to calm public fears in an attempt to avoid widespread panic. [phone ringing] - Yes? - Tell me about this chip. The Avanti chip is the solution along with finding the leader, someone who understands technology, world economics, as well as social and spiritual ramifications. (male on phone) I've spoken to my advisors. They tell me you know a lot about it. Well, yes, I do. And if you think I can help, please-- (male on phone) We need you in Berlin. - I understand. - Now. I leave immediately. See you soon. ??? "The dragon stood on the shore of the sea." It has begun. ??? Why didn't you kill him? 'Cause of what my brother said to me about having a purpose. That moment when I held his life in my hands, it all made sense to me. Don't worry, it's gonna be okay. Looks like we're right over the city. Look! It's the end of the world! My brother would have said... it's a new beginning. My brother would have said... have faith. ??? ??? ???
