★★ Sub_master HD ★★ Is that true? Does that small temple work? It's just a rumour. Do you understand? Heard from the old folks at your place? - How do you know? - Is that bad? Kia at? LAND FOR SALE This is real. Aren't you sure? You stop. Or here. Did you see? YES. Something white and white. Stop it. - I did. - Nonsense. Don't be such a coward. Civet incense? It can run on those two legs. Don't act like you know it all! Can civet speak? You stop. Be a temporary replacement. Give a teacher maternity leave. The job guarantees a minimum of six months, so I'll take it. I'll be looking for a new job during that time. Yes, but it's better than sitting idle. I cannot pay the renewal fee. Don't remind me. I told you I already knew. No worries. I've decided. Yes. Ok. Rub… Must be tired? Drink some tea. I thank you. Honestly see. Do you want this job? Are you bothering me? Not at all. I am temporarily out of work. I really appreciate this opportunity. By the way , from what year did you work as a trainee teacher? Come on, ma'am. Don't say it. I'm squeezing all my remaining confidence here. She understood. Try your best. Yusuke, clean the dishes for me. This. Thank you. - What do I make? - Mixed rice. Really. I look so bored. Stop being angry. Wakaba, don't say that. You shut up! - Itsuki! - Any! Stop. Don't you have dinner? Why do you say that? Because it looks so dull. I just want to make you happy. You made it worse. There's no fun without Minato. This is a four-player game. Sonny, you didn't count. This is a three-way battle. Stop teasing. HEY! Drill! Are not! He panicked. Itsuki, without Minato you'd be awful. Shut up. I've lost interest. Exit here. The game ends. No fun at all. It's true that he always protects me. Now it's your turn to protect me. But… I'm useless. Not. Not. Nor is it. Not at all. All that nonsense. Master, what about here? What a collection of three powerful wishes. They shine brightly. I think they deserve it. Right. Alright that's it. Are you ready already? Can I activate the Complete Book of Youkai? But to solve this, we need… someone at this level. But Master… It's the ultimate ghost. These wishers are just children. - Children? - Yes. But they can succeed because they are children. No other ghost can make this wish come true. But if they can't pass the test... Come on… Their wish is as sincere as this. They have a chance. Don't talk nonsense like that. - What? - Nothing. Both here and here. Three lines? It's too hard. But you mustn't break the rules to help them. The challenge of the whole letter… Must be overcome by the children themselves. Of course. I'll go tell them. But no matter how you say it, the three lines are… Wake up. Huh? What's up? Keep your voice down. My name is Book Children. Children's book? Do you want your wish to come true? My wish? At the small temple? YES. Want it. I'm willing to do anything! It would be a life-threatening ordeal . Life threatening? Okay. Accept the challenge. I got it. This is a message from the owner. "Get the Youkai Complete Book at the second-hand bookstore near the small temple". What's that? Right in my bedroom a little white ghost asked me if I wanted my wish to come true. Is it this tall? How do you know? A life-threatening challenge? Wow… shivers all over me. How do you know? I dreamed of it too. Huh? Did you see the real thing when you woke up this morning? What do you mean? Maybe that strange ghost really did appear. No way. So scared then. Does it refer to the Complete Book of Youkai? - And that part too? - Seriously? Sonny! I also saw that white ghost. You just want to enter the story. I swear I did. - Lie. - It's real. - Redraw it. - Okay. - Are you sure? - YES. - Good morning. - We salute you, teacher. - Good morning. - We salute you, teacher. The principal looks so cool. Of course. What a horrible coincidence. Same dream. EH! It's unexpected! It's Children's Book, right? Standard. I told you I saw it. My God… This is terrible. - Don't panic. - But that's it. Wait. Does it mention the Little Temple? Our wish! Can we make it real? - Is it true? - Seriously? You guys take your seats. From today, Ms. Yoko Hayama will replace Ms. Henmi in charge of the children's class. The teacher is so cute. Vice-principal, you must be very happy to have such a beautiful new teacher. No more joking. Miss Hayama would like to say a few words. Yes. Good morning. She is Yoko Hayama as the vice principal just said. This is her first time in class but she will try her best. As you all know, Ms. Henmi is on maternity leave. Ms. Hayama will be your substitute teacher during this time. So you're a reserve teacher. Silence for the teacher. Right. We'll call her the Reserve. Behave properly. Oi. At me. Hey, hey. What if there 's a used bookstore there? I will enter. Right? Right. But it said the ordeal would be life-threatening. Sound a bit virtual? What does it mean? We will have to risk our lives. Anything else? Wait. So if we fail, we lose our lives? If you don't go, you won't know. - Come on, Sonny. - Want. Want? Wait for me! OTHER BOOK STORE Unbelievable indeed. This place used to be a small temple. Was it built in the night? Impossible. How could this place be built in one night? I can't believe it. What should we do? Let's go. Wait a moment. Let's look inside first. YES. Here's the chance. Those kids… What do you do? Minato! Do not. Impossible. This. - Did you find it? - YES. - Shall we go get it? - Let's go. Is this what we have to get? Looks expensive. Do they rent out? Or do we steal? You really are an idiot. Shut up. I'm just kidding. Hi guys! Ouch pain! Do not panic. Let me explain the principle. They've disappeared. Kids! Come back here! Who is she? Sorry. I am their teacher. I'll bring them back right away! EH. I haven't explained the rules yet. This bookstore is so big! - God! - It's so weird! So strange. God. What kind of bookstore is that? Guys… Wait. Why is Miss Pre here? Huh? This is… Turns out it extended here. OTHER BOOK STORE Finally escaped. What is this place? - Dammit. - What's up? Look. Are you still holding it? I haven't paid. Probably have to pay it back. I don't want to go back. But… Hey… Guys… What are you guys up to? Well then… Flying object! This… LAND FOR SALE What is this thing? STOP - We cut her tail. - Almost died. How about this one? Just hold on until it's settled. Huh? Hide it somewhere. I will be considered a thief. So give it back. I dare not. He is useless. - What did you say? - What? - Huh? - What? Go home now. Please! I'll call you guys if there's a problem. Let's go, Sonny. Stop calling me useless. STOP I'm back. Mommy? Where is my mother? MAGAZINE Mom upstairs? Huh? What's up? What is this thing? Door bell… Itsuki, are you there? - Huh? - You won't believe it! - Very dangerous! - We're here! Please excuse me. Phone! Give me your phone! - Hurry up! - This. EH! - So is yours. - What does that mean? Our phones are also dead. Huh? What's wrong with my machine? Don't you guys find it strange that everyone's phones are dead? What must we do? Let me go to Google. But it's my phone. - And adults... - How are adults? Children again. We're the only ones left in town. Huh? Have you seen? Yeah… What's the matter? What word do not understand? Yu… ka… pe… kyan? What did you say? Probably the wind... - Do you really think so? - Are not. - Taichi? - EH… Minato? Itsuki and Sonny too! What are you guys doing here? You too, Minato… Why is this? Why? Why? Somehow I got lost in this world. How did you guys get here? Come here? We live here. But clearly something is very odd. Look. I think this is the virtual world. I don't know why I'm here again. Don't worry. We have us now. Do you guys know how to escape? We're still researching here. It's also true. But we'll find a way. I promise. Come here. You again. What's so secret? That boy's story. If you think this is a dream, you are wrong. What about Minato? Virtual person? He wanted to say the same thing. Minato is Minato. He's real. Look, I know right away. If you say so… then sure. You guys… Done talking yet? Minato, did you know that you… First. Try to find a way out of here. First of all, a used bookstore. Any. Let's go. Don't tell Minato what happened. He will be shocked. Alright. It's here, right? What's here? We came to this world from a used bookstore that used to be here. Secondhand bookstore? Where is it? Look over there. Was it like that before? Are not. I think it should be taller. It's virtual. Go try it. - YES. - Let's go. - Minato! - YES… Oh wow! What is this? It's spent. We're stuck in this world. What now? There is an adult. Miss Yoko. She's here with us, isn't she? An adult but a substitute teacher. I don't know if she can help. Who is that? Miss Henmi's replacement. She came to this world with us. So where is she? I know her house. She is the granddaughter of Mrs. Hayama. Who is Mrs. Hayama? A friend. You're really close to the old people. How about this house? Is Miss Pre here? - Kids! - Lucky. There is an adult. What luck? What's up? You're here to chase us, aren't you? Do you guys know anything? We don't even know why this is happening. We thought you would know something. What did I say? How can you rely on adults? What do you mean? Why do you guys rely on her? You're just a Sub, aren't you? OH. Are you angry? Introduce me. AT. This is Ms. Yoko Hayama. This is Minato Tachibana. Hello teacher. I'm Minato Tachibana. We are all in the same class. Same class? Shall we come in? - Thank you. - We come in here. Remember to close it. - I beg your pardon. - I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. Inside was even more messy. If you don't like it, just go home. Not that I want to be here… Stop it. Calm. Rub. This connection. - How far is it? - How do I know? Look this. We're too high. Be careful. - Too high. - Don't fall. What if you fall? Look over there. - Guys! - Watch! Are you guys okay? Are you guys stuck? - Is it okay? - This! What is that sound? We were just over there, right? Real crazy. - What's up? - Who knows! So you guys take that room. You and I take the other room. That's not fair. You want a girl in that weird room? Are not. We understand. Please. It is indeed Minato. Can't go wrong anywhere. Do you think I'm a ghost? Are not. Ma'am, let's go. - Are you sure? - Yes. This used to be her house. - Are you guys sleeping? - Yes. You don't mind do you? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm glad Minato is back. Probably just over a week. Um. Do you know how long the last week has felt? I'm happy for you, Itsuki. Not so. How then? Nothing. Don't push me. - Get it for me. - Huh? Here? - This? - Not that. What? Sonny, you're awesome. DON'T EASE DON'T LIVE Let me try. Ready? Any. Turn off! Oi. Can you guys do it? Why is this all of a sudden? That's what she wanted to ask, too. Thanks for meal. Too full. You two wash the dishes. - Seriously? - Very serious. The three of them cooked dinner. No way. Happy. It's like going camping. You can always be happy. Don't, stop it. What's that? Should I go see it? Looks like it can't get in. Surely this is just a dream, right? We should stay indoors at night. Don't go anywhere. Careful. It's good now. This is it? - Good. - It's fine. What do you guys wish for in such a small shrine? Huh? We're here for a wish. That was the beginning for it all. What did you wish for? Probably like you guys. Think and see. Let's write down a wish and count to three let everyone see it. - Okay. - That sounds good. Thank you. - Thank. - This. Any. One two Three! Just as I thought. Sonny, pencil. - Thank you. - Nothing. Still here. But… Look. Well, there's nothing tomorrow. Go to sleep already. - Again? - Again. How can you sleep like this? But it's like being in the park. Please… The kids are back in bed. It seems so. I'm so happy to meet you guys. Even when taking a hot shower. Why did you come to this world? The memory is so fuzzy. I don't understand why I'm here. Why do you look so serious? Ah… just now… Never mind. Nothing. - Good night. - Goodnight. So in the dream, you were told to take this book. Then when you get it, come here. It must have been because of the book. Huh? Now there are only two lines left on the cover. SEVEN Wasn't that the same yesterday? Are not. Yesterday there were two and a half lines. You really are meticulous. The line becomes shorter? What about this "seven"? Probably book seven. Let's see what's inside. Children's Book? Yesterday's pages were blank. The ghost in my dream. "Book Nhi is very knowledgeable about Youkai Toan Thu. It is always near the person who has the book. It is very agile and scratching is very painful. But don't worry. You can catch it by pressing the Youkai Complete Book on it." Does that mean it's near you? Really? Where? In your house? Calm. It's not here. But the book says so. Then we must have seen it. Did you guys see it? You guys found me. Too slow. Only now did I pay attention. Quickly! Press the book on it! Catched it! Oh man! It looks so cute! I hate being called cute. Catch it! It's running away! Are you okay? Quickly. It escaped. It's gone. That's a commendable effort. Taichi, great job. I have a brain. - Taichi. You are so good! - I know! - Star? - Why what? What now? Ah… Yeah… FINISHED It's changed. It's a white ghost. Should I try summoning it like in the game? Come on out, Book Children! Really ra. You guys tricked me! They're all thieves. So you'd rather stay in the book? Are not. I'm sorry. It's you, isn't it? You made them take the book. I have been approved. Don't complain to me. By the way, who are you? Did you take the challenge too? But her wish has not been granted. Treaty? Which treaty? I got it. She was just pulled in. Pull in? Fine. She can return to the normal world. Is it possible? I can't leave the kids alone. You can if you want. I will stay. Anyway, I'm an adult. An adult is not very helpful. Terrible. Bye bye. Wait. Taichi. If you stay, think of one wish. You must have summoned me for something. What? You summoned me for no reason? If you are familiar with this Youkai Complete Book , please tell us. Can I answer? Okay. Say. You can catch a ghost by pressing it on the correct page in the book. These guys know. It is also written in this. What patience. Next up is this main point. The captured ghost will obey the only command you give. OK? I am done! What about these blank pages? What? I told you, what are these blank pages? Both the stripe on the cover and the number seven… Look this. It's six now. Each ghost only received one command. Huh? What command? You ordered me to answer your question. Is that so? Seriously? You didn't tell us. Did you guys ask me? This. Probably six because we caught it. So we have to catch six more ghosts like it? Why are you in such a hurry? Can't get anything. You can only catch each ghost once and ask it to help you only once. Damned. Good luck passing the challenge of Youkai Toan Thu. Exactly as expected. Isn't that right, lady? You told me you would risk your life. Daredevil? Maybe… Knew it. The next ghost. - Yamahiko? - Are not. It's Yamabiko. "Echo" in that mountain area. "Scream towards the ridges and you'll hear the echo. It's because of Yamabiko. Obscene words will infuriate the ghost and it may attack you. But don't worry. It won't attack if you don't use obscene words." That means… Is it really here? Probably if it resonated in the mountains. Yahoo! Yahoo! It is here. Turns out it was a ghost before. Alright. Let me. Face poop! Face poop! Bedweed! Bedweed! - Boys... - She knew. Silly! Silly! You're so good. Sorry. Rotten mouth! Rotten mouth? Eh… It sounds angry. The thing…! Then done. That's enough! Itsuki! Book! Let me! - You OK? - Are you all right? - Are you hurt? - Are you all right? Can you wake up? You okay? Have pain anywhere? Not as fast as I thought. Let me. Come here, you stupid voice! God… It's life threatening. Bend down! It's not OK! Scamper! It's back. Over here, you idiot! This side! FINISHED Great! Success! Made it! But this ghost hunt sucks. But there is a time limit. Look. I already know what it means. One and a half days left. And have to catch five more. What if we can't? Will this world perish? And what about us? Disappeared? Not good. Must hurry up. What is next? Ittan-momen. This one has many legs. "A ghost looks like a cloth. It can fly. When it's angry, it will wrap you around you to suffocate you. But don't worry. It hates dirty things, so it will avoid dirty people." It can take your breath away. Don't worry. That's too far away. In that case… did you bring these with you? She used to be a designer in Tokyo. - Miss's job in Tokyo Pres... - Stop calling me that. Ink for silkscreen printing. Let's use them. We must capture five more before tomorrow night. - This. - Yes? Any. Let's go. But where do we find Ittan-momen? Should we lure it out? Mr. Suzuki is a master fisherman with live bait. The bait will lure the fish out. Mr. Suzuki? YES. We are fishing buddies. I used to call him Mr. Suz. You're really close to the old people. It's true that you have the right qualities. Look! Ittan-momen! That name! It's come. Who are you? This is my area! From today on this place is mine. Are you going to make fun of me? Variable! Just a piece of cloth! Trap? Cowards! You're angry! Sonny! Sonny! I can't hold it anymore. Lose yet? Drill! Stop! So dirty! If you don't want to get dirty, come down here! Oh this! Already! Know! FINISHED Finally got three of them. Can we catch them all within the time limit? What if we catch all seven? Surely there will be some reward? Back to the normal world? We have to catch four more before tomorrow closes. Where's the Prep? She's doing something in our room. Children… We need to work as a team. So… Ta-da! YEAR TOAN THUUUUUUUUUUUU Uniform T-shirt for the battle on the last day. Who wants any? Raise your hand! A little too cute for me. How about cute? But wearing the same T-shirt… That kind of cheering spirit is a bit… Miss… We have entered a new era. Right. She is so outdated. Any. Try it on. She does it for everyone. This. She must have looked like an overzealous cheerleader. Do not say that. Let's wear this shirt tomorrow and give it a try, shall we? Go ahead! Go forward… FOUR Are you crying because we do n't like your shirt? She is chopping onions. Curry again? Her cooking skills are limited. You don't force me to eat. She accepted. Someone come out here instead. I only know how to use the microwave. My late grandmother used to forbid me to cook. Yesterday I chopped onions. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Like this, how can girls follow. Just let me. I have protection. Very good. Nasal tissue paper… I miss my mom's curry so much. Hey… He suddenly woke up again. But really, what will happen to us? Don't tell us we'll be stuck here forever. Don't worry. We'll get out of here. With 30 years of life experience, she has been through many things. Just stay calm and everything will be fine. That's always been the case with her. Doesn't sound very good. Words of a failed adult. I quit. There are times when you should listen to adults. Okay, now go help her. Yes. I'll take the cup. God! The next monster! - Huh? - What's wrong? Hyakume? That's a monster. It looks dangerous. "It has 100 eyes that can strike you unconscious. But don't worry. Make sure there are 100 victims before you." We need 100 victims to save our lives? It looks unmatched. This. With so many eyes, its weak point must be onions. Maybe just throw balloons full of chopped onions at it? Who knows, it's effective. We have to find it to catch it. Try asking Children's Book. It's very stubborn. It will want something in return… You're eating my curry. What dish is this? Top notch. Spicy curry made by myself. What kind of fun and angry times. I had no idea last night. Tell us where Hyakume is in exchange for dinner. Can you give me more? Of course. You can eat as much as you want. This. Why do you have to take this job? The smell rose up as if we were inside an onion. Thank you for handling. Can I call you Miss Onion from now on? Are not. You forbid it. Guys, don't miss it. Yes… By the way, where's the uniform? Ah… We don't want to ruin our shirt. Huh? We have decided to save the shirt until it is absolutely necessary. When is it? It's not time yet… Right? Guys, this is the last day. According to the clue, this is the place? Changed the subject again. It has 100 eyes so it will like where there are many similar things. The trees look the same but… It only gives me a clue after eating five bowls of curry. Back away. It's there. Look. It's good now. Right here. It looks really scary. It's true that there are other giants. Time to show off my kicking technique . Let me go first. Look. Help this! It's open! My eyes! Who's that? Be revealed! It's my turn! Any! My eyes! Total farce. Alright, Hyakume! I am the Great Hero Sonny. OH. I have come to defeat you! Talking like a samurai? He is very close to the ladies. I don't remember having any grudge against your family but nothing can touch me. Now let's fight fair! Oi. Oh my eyes! What are you going to prove? Right. Hyakume! Help this! Oh no! What kind of weird liquid is this? Poison? Is it poison? I can't believe I was defeated by a fragile virgin. It's shameful! Are you a ninja? Sorry. The monster doesn't seem as strong as we thought. Ah yes. You lose first. I didn't lose. Just a home goal. That's even worse. There. She said everything would be fine. Thanks to her tearful efforts. Really? Are you going to be witty? Stop it. But this ring star is Minato. Yes, that's right. I'm just learning from your blunders . Did it just move? Let go. That's the Mobile Monkey Snake. I can't. My hands are stuck. "Moving Monkey Serpent will take people to the sky". Oh! This! Oh no! Where will it go? "The destination is..." Where is it? I can't say. Tell me! - Kingdom Come. - Huh? What must we do? "But don't worry. Just avoid the weird monkeys." It is too late. I'll bring it down. Let's jump up. - Miss Sub... - Don't call her that. Sonny. It's flying up! Sonny, jump! I will catch it! Can you do that? I can't afford it! We should have done that first! Why is everyone up there? Miss Yoko told us to jump. But… You should have warned everyone in the first place! I just thought of it! Done. I'm done! We are too high. - That's… - The afterlife? No… I don't want to die yet. Don't freak out anymore. We're too young to go there. You just have a new goal in life. She is 30 years old but still… quite young. I am being cheered by a child. Everyone, don't give up. There will be a solution. Truly Minato. Exactly this kind of stuff. Don't give up until the last minute. But… What should we do? HEY! Guys! Hello. Sonny! Here you are! Shall I put the Monkey Snake in the book? YES! Do it! - Play foolishly! - Oh slowly... Slowly already! That's five people. I didn't think I could bear this much weight... I have completed my mission! See you again! - Goodbye. - Thank you. Sorry. I summoned Ittan-momen. Sorry for what. Without you, the entire guild would be in the afterlife now. Thank you. I made the right choice. Well done, Sonny. Thanks for meal. Don't get up. You're the hero. Sonny, today was really cool. I saved everyone. Without you, everyone is gone. Speaking of which, she said she has a new goal in life. What are you? There's nothing specific. She just blurted out. - Virtual reality. - The virtual. It's real. - Virtual. - She swears. She naturally blurted out. Squeeze my shoulder for me to continue. Everyone is helpful. But what about you? Truly a roadblock. Can you help me? Another child. It's Itsuki. Alright. Sit down. You told me to do it for you. Again. Eww. Yes, it appeared. That's my sentence! There are two Itsuki. "Mother Than. If you complain about some hard work a ghost that looks exactly like you will come out of the mirror." That's fine. "But if you're not careful, the ghost will replace you." It's important there. "But don't worry. It won't appear if you keep doing the work." He always finds out too late. You are a ghost. I am the real one. Don't order me anymore. Go back to the mirror. Cannot distinguish. Who is the ghost? It. You are his friends. Does no one notice? I can. Taichi! I know his voice. You are the real Itsuki. I know I can trust you. Don't joke. You are mistaking that person. We've been friends since preschool. Itsuki, come over here. YES. I knew you would recognize me. Right. Any. Hand. Don't resist, fake Itsuki. Drill. Wait. It's me here. Just kidding. You are a fake! That's hurt… Drill. Please clarify again. You think I'm a fake? I'm a bit mistaken. What's wrong? Honestly, I can't tell the difference. It's clearly a ghost. Starfruit tree friendship. So sad. It hurts again. It's about to run away! The other way! - Catch it! - Quick! - Stop! - Catch it! - Stop! - No way! Come here. What is this? You must arrest both of us if you want to complete the mission. They are as clever as Itsuki. Huh? How about this? Surprise? The smaller they are, the more childish they are. Oh Itsuki! Yeah! You guys are so cute. Itsuki likes Minato the most! Huh? I love you! It's their word. I remember you said that. You guys were engaged when you were in kindergarten. Stop it! Hey, stop now. She meant this. Give her the book. - What’s that? - Lend her some. Yes. This. I think they'll do whatever you say. Let's try. - Yes. - You try. Try it out. Would you guys line up and get into this book? Agree! Goodbye! Success. This. But this ghost is probably useless. - Sorry. - It's the ghost, not you. TWO ONE The last ghost. Hurry up. We don't have time. "Jizuri can distort space and time. A brutal demon with countless subordinates in a giant nest." Well… It must be the final boss. The ultimate devil. There's no "Don't worry" part. Is there no way to fight back? Do I have to defeat it myself? Time distortion? Time? Time… I know what that means. I understand it all. Tell us. The challenge of the book. - The reason we're here. - What? We're here to make this Jizuri warp time. To be able to return to the past. And our wish will come true! Right. That's right. I do not understand. She also tolerates it. We came here after a wish. A wish? We finally understood why this happened. Our wish will come true if we defeat Jizuri. I don't understand anything. What did you guys wish for? We… We can't say. It's not fair. I also have a right to know what's going on. It's like you guys want to leave me. So sad… We can't tell you! Alright. You guys can talk without me going. Drill. You guys are just shy… Nevermind. I won't be here anymore. Minato! This… Can't you see she's hurt? Just tell her. We can't. Not this. You guys are so stubborn. She will sympathize with us. Is it serious? This. Maybe we should tell her. You promise not to tell Minato, okay? - It depends… - Then no. She won't tell her. She swears. Is it so easy? I say, I don't trust adults. You heard it. All words are not good. But you helped us on Monkey Serpent. That's right. It's also true. I think we can trust Miss Yoko. Alright. Let her see. PLEASE SAVE MINato What is this thing? She is currently in the hospital. Hospital? On Minato's birthday, we planned to make a surprise. Usually we go home together… But that day we deliberately let her go home alone. I can't believe you guys left me. DANGEROUS AREA - Oh! - Oh my God! Deep coma. She is fighting for her life. That's our fault. We don't want him to know his life is in danger. But if we can go back to the past through Jizuri, maybe we can stop… Really? What are you doing here? Sorry. I'm hiding out there. You must have heard… Right. What are we doing here? You guys risked your lives to come to this dangerous world for me. Why? By… The world without you would be no more fun. We couldn't protect you then. But now we are here. We were given another chance. So we… no regrets. No regrets at all. I'm glad it's all here... Thank you guys. I think so too. Sonny too. Right. She, too. She's glad she's here and helps them with whatever she can. What's up? Are you okay? What's wrong? Again? Don't you feel anything? What do you feel? Try looking at my hand. What's up? She faded once before. So that means…? This line… could be the limit of Minato's life time. Your life in the real world may be in jeopardy. You mean Minato will die when the line disappears? We must do something. Let's go find Jizuri. Jizuri's nest… Where would it be? Book Children, I know you're here. I can't help you guys. I don't wish anymore, so tell everyone where Jizuri is. She came to this world and went through a lot of trouble. But don't you wish? Right. Now I have one more important wish. It was to save Minato. Miss Yoko… You don't need to wish for yourself. Please tell everyone where Jizuri is. I heard her wish clearly. Here is the clue. Did you hear? Jizuri is building a nest. Our school is over there. Let's go. Wait! YEAR TOAN THUUUUUUUUUUUU Is that Jizuri's nest? Let's go guys! Yes. She knew she would have to swing again… Wait. They… - Do something! - Come out, Yamabiko! Let's deflect their attack! Oh! Come out, Hyakume! Please protect us! Let me. Just let me take care of it. Go find Jizuri quickly. - Alright. - Let's go. - Stop them! - Thank you! No thanks. I just follow the rules of the book. Newspapers. Youkai Full Book has infiltrated. Youkai Full Book has infiltrated. Jizuri! Where are you? Please come out here. Who dares to call my name? Are you human? We would like to ask a favor. Can you come in here? What you hold... You are going to lock me up in Youkai Full Book? It is better to be too. We will be very appreciative. Don't you know who I am? Ridiculous! I cannot condone this insolence. What must we do? - The Demon Seal of the Complete Book... - We can't get close to him. Let her. She is an adult. You don't have a physical advantage. Don't be reckless. Taichi! Oh! Taichi! Hyakume! Sorry, I'm late. Will you still help us? Not just us. Everybody… Protect you and your friends. It is the pride and honor of our devil. Hyakume… But… Itsuki? I… wanted Minato back at any cost. Don't run away from me like cowards. Go ahead! Come in! Party... Snake Monkey and Yamabiko. It's interesting. Snake Monkey! Yamabiko! It's interesting indeed. This. Damn army! Hyakume! Now I have enough eyes to look around. Are you guys okay? Minato…Looking at you… We just stop. Huh? After everything you've been through? We risked our lives for you. I never asked you guys. Don't talk about life so easily! Minato! I'd rather die than watch you die for me. Minato… Minato. It's time to say goodbye. Are not! We have no choice! He's too strong! We cannot change fate. Have you understood? Go back to your place. Second hand bookstore. It's that. Just come in. Minato! I'm glad you came! I am very happy to meet you… Last! Minato! Is this the real world? Are you back? I'm back, right? Are not… No, impossible. Will the result be like this? I do not accept this fate! Itsuki! Minato! Why? Why did you come back? I can't leave you here like that. Both of us. You guys… We don't want to return to the world without you. Go back together! Children's Book! Ittan-momen! This bunch of trouble. Take us to Jizuri. If attacking from a blind spot… It's a risky move. Are you sure? Right. I'm sure. I will show you the power of the useless. The power of the useless? Big stupid name! Catch us again! If you are good, come here! That head supreme demon! These guys will butcher you for breakfast. The scoundrels! You attack children? Damn army! Damn army! I'm not useless. We don't have blind spots. Consequences for you. What? Surprise? Don't tell… Stunt Ghost? I'm useless but still useful. I have a brain. Huh? - Itsuki! - Itsuki! Are you okay? You've been successful. Hurry up! Do it! Come out, Jizuri! Take me to the time when Minato got into an accident. I can do it. No problem. But… But why? It will make a little change in the world. You will lose all memories of this world. Guys! We'll bring it down. Help this! Fun. Everything will be all right. I'm so happy to see you one last time! Drill. We will still be friends but Ms. Yoko would be a complete stranger. Thank you guys. But don't worry. We will definitely meet again. She won't forget. Don't forget us. YES. Do it. It's okay if I forget. As long as Minato lives, we will create more memories. Because we're still just a bunch of kids! Minato! Scamper! - Huh? What? - Fast! - EH! - What? Did you just tell me to run? Huh? Me? Are not… Successful yet? Great! Great! I've done my part. Goodbye. Looks like we won't remember anything about this world. Honestly, she was glad she was here. Thanks to you guys Now she knew what she had to do with her life. Miss… want to be a teacher. She is already a teacher. She is a good teacher. It's true. Just a little carefree. You keep breaking the crowd. Even in the real world, she can be a great teacher. Guys stop. Don't make adults cry. Shall we forget what happened here? May I tell you? Say what? Minato. I've always liked you. Huh? What? - Did you hear that? - I'm a lucky girl. Miss Yoko! What do you call her? I like her too! UNMARKETABLE! Wait… I was just joking. Huh? Are not. I'm telling the truth. She is very honored. Time in this world with you guys and Miss Yoko… Very precious indeed. I see that too. I want to remember forever. - Me too. - Me too. Thank you everyone. Nothing. The kids worked very hard. Our part is done. See you again. - Goodbye! - I love you, Minato! Some kind of curry is really awesome. Book Nhi, thank you for everything. By the way, Itsuki, let's talk about it again when we return to our world. Come on. - Say it again! - Hold on. I can't. There is none. Shame. I'm happy for you. Say it again! They've been successful. We finally get to use it. GOOD "But don't worry. Never give up and you will succeed." Light everyone. - Good morning. - We salute you, teacher. - Good morning. - We salute you, teacher. - Good morning. - The headmaster looks so cool. I know. What about the ball game? Ah right. What to do? I will cross. And I stopped. - All right. - All right. - Perfect tactics. - Perfect. Who will replace Miss Henmi? - I want to be a teacher. - I hope so too. I want someone like Miss Henmi. She was so kind. Good morning. Greet! - I hope it's time to play. - Me too. - Take your seats. - Here comes the teacher. From today, Ms. Yoko Hayama will replace Ms. Henmi in charge of the children's class. The teacher is so cute. Vice-principal, you must be very happy to have such a beautiful new teacher. No more joking. - Miss Hayama, could you say a few words. - Yes. Good morning kids. Good morning teacher. She is Yoko Hayama as the vice principal just said. This is her first time in class but she will try her best. As you all know, Ms. Henmi is on maternity leave. Ms. Hayama will be your substitute teacher during this time. So you're a reserve teacher. Are not. She seriously wants to be a good teacher. I still have a lot to learn, so I hope you guys can help me. What's wrong, teacher? I'm sorry. Do not know why. Is everyone crying? Um. Are we forgetting something important? This. Do you know the pain of ghosts? It is pain from a lost hand or limb from an accident or something like that. AT… We children lose a lot of things when we grow up. I don't think they're gone. They are right here. You guys are a know-it-all! Let's go. - Let's go! - Let's go! I run the fastest! OTHER BOOK STORE This challenge of the book is over. Yes! My master. Everything is fine. I told the kids they would succeed. The sincere wish gave strength to the children. We have a new ultimate demon. You helped them, didn't you? I don't know what the owner is saying. But never mind. Let's go on a journey to find the next wish. Alright. So… how many more wishes do we have to fulfill? I do not know. It depends on how strong the demon is. We still have a long way to go. {\move(10,10,190,230,100,400)\fad(0,1000)\fscx25\fscy25\t(0,6000,\fscx125\fscy125)\c&H000000&\3c&H00FFFF&}★★★★★ Sub_master HD ★★★★★
