I am the stranger. I fought with General Lee. And lost. I am Salomy Jane. I like trees better than men. They are straight. I am Jack Marbury. Lucky at cards. Most times, unlucky in love. I am Yuba Bill. Everybody knows me. I drive the stagecoach. I am Rufe Waters. I own the finest pack of bloodhounds in the county. I am called a lot of names. By different men. I am Red Pete. Folks say. I wouldn't stop at nothing. I am Lize. I am married to a man who don't work. But I love him. I am Phineas Baldwin. I stand for law. Order. And decency. A pious man. Of simple tastes. Hello. Salomy. Yuba's coming with the stage. Let's hurry home. He'll be stopping to talk to Pa. Get away. Get away you big, black bear. Pa. Yuba's coach is coming. Can I go to town with him? I guess you can, Salomy, if you make yourself a little more decent. Put something more on. - Sure. I'll get fixed up, Pa. Don't tickle me, Miss Salomy. Give me my boots and I'll be all ready. I thought you'd put on something to make yourself decent like your Pappy said. What for? - What for? When the right man comes along. You'll take off them pants quick enough. And get yourself into a dress and make yourself look all pretty. Come on, Mammy. Tell me another story. Hello there, Madison Clay. - How was the trip up? Mighty fine. Mighty fine, Madison. I got a distinguished passenger on board. The next mayor of Redwood City and head of the Puritan League. Hello Mr Clay. - Hello Baldwin. Back in California again? And happy to return to those I love and respect. Come back afore sundown, Salomy. - Sure, Pa. Hello Yuba Bill. - Hello honey. Miss Salomy Jane. The door is open for you. Alright, Baldwin. Alright, Queenie. We can try in here. Now the trip begins to be enjoyable. Think so? It seems pretty crowded to me. Hello Yuba. - Gosh, darn. If you ain't a wild one. Crawling over the top of a stagecoach when it's a-rolling. Wait. Howdy, Master. Howdy. I heard the singing as I came by. Kinda made me homesick. Yes, sir. Who's place is this? This is Master Clay's place. But Master ain't home. If you want to rest, the hospitality is yours. No thanks, Mammy. I'm on my way to Redwood. You're pretty near there now. Just over the hill yonder. About eight miles. Straight ahead? - Yes, sir. Where is y'all from? I am from Virginia. Virginia? Lord, there is lots of folks here from Virginia. I'm interested in only one of them. A man who calls himself .. Baldwin. My, my. Everybody knows Master Baldwin. You will find him. Thanks. Oh. We fetched up some goobers for the children. Thank you. Your heart is as big as these trees. I don't know about the heart but the belly is a fair size. Hello there, Red Pete. How is the world treating you? Tolerable. What do you know, Yuba? Well, I know a fellow only has three friends in this here world. A silver dollar and an old yellow dog and his moll. Pa. Pa. Will you get me a yellow dog? The first one I ever see. Stonewall, what you swallowing about down there? He wants Salomy Jane to take him swimming. I tell you what we'll do. We'll all ride to town with Yuba and on the way back we'll all go a-swimming. Good. Shake a leg there, young-un. Come on now. You must not cry. You'll never be a big stagecoach driver like Yuba Bill. Put on your hat. Step on old Bill's let now and come right on up. That's the girl. - Yes, dear. Well, my little man. Where do you go swimming? At hat that place where there is a bend in the creek. You know. Give me your wing here. Did you get him there? I'll take care of them. You know that, Lize. Come on, boys. Bye. Pete. I wish you wouldn't creep up on me that way. You'd have heard me alright it you weren't thinking so hard about .. You aren't going to do it, Pete? Now, you take care of the kids. And I'll take care of my business. And you. And the kids. We don't want to be taken care of the way you're planning. Now let me be, I tell you. Ling, get my bag back in there. Miss Salomy, may I assist you? You sure made certain not to drop me, Mr Baldwin. If you feel that way about it .. I'll put you right back again. - No you won't. I never let the same bee sting me twice. Surely, Salomy. You aren't afraid of me? I have known your father for a long time. It sure take anybody a long time to know you, Mr Baldwin. Phineas Baldwin. Redwood City extends the hand of welcome to her next mayor. Thank you, Colonel Starbottle. I am happy indeed to back among my old friends. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Now, would you be good enough to join me in a slight libation? This way. If this town knew him like I do he wouldn't be running for mayor. He'd be running for his life. You're sure speaking gospel, Salomy. Who you looking for, Jess Larabee? I thought that rat Madison Clay might have come to town with you. When it comes to rats, I'd hate to put a piece of cheese under your nose. Just the same, you'd better tell him to keep out of my way. He don't keep out of the way of rattlesnakes. He steps on them. Maybe before he can step .. I'll be a-striking. Larabee. I heard what you said. And I am warning both you and Clay. That if the there's any killing, the one that does it will swing for it. Well, he ought to swing anyway. That's the penalty for cattle-thieving, ain't it? There ain't no sense in arguing with a crazy man. Clay ain't no cattle thief. And everyone knows it but you. You know, he has me hot under the collar. I was just reaching for my gun when he sneaked off. I don't know which is worse. Him or Baldwin. I know there is one mighty nice fellow in this here town. And for some strange reason which I ain't been able to figure out yet. He asked me to fetch him back a big box of chocolates. This trip. Was it Jack Marbury? Now, I ain't meaning nobody previous. Come on, Billy. Was it Marbury? Now Salomy, don't you try to angle this out of me because I've got too far now. Cut them, Waters. What do you say? Alright, Marbury. Push in my IOUs. Against what? - My ranch. Them looks like pretty big stakes. What they're really playing for is a clear road to Salomy Jane. Look here, Marbury. That's six cards you handed yourself. Six cards? - Yes. Count them. One, two, three, four, five, six. I wonder how I ever came to be so careless. The hand is dead. The money is mine. That's the first time I ever dealt myself six cards. And got caught at it. I know you. You're trying to make a big hero of yourself. You think Salomy Jane will hear of it. - Just a minute. Don't mention her name in this place. I don't like it. You don't like it? Everybody here knows I ain't the one to say anything against her. I aim to marry her. You? Yes. And you won't even be here for the wedding. I'm going to run you out of town. Perhaps. But you'll be in front of me all the way, Rufe. You have to get up pretty early in the morning to win out against me. There's an old proverb somewhere that says if you want to really know a man .. Gamble with him or travel with him. I guess I did plenty of that alright. See here, Baldwin. I am stumping for you. When you are mayor. I want you to run these crooked gamblers out of town. Did you get that? You what? Finish it, Rufe. Go on. Finish it. Tell him, Rufe. You haven't got a chance. Now. All aboard. I'm going out now. All aboard. Pardon me, ladies. We're going to pull out now. All aboard. Well, goodbye. Girls, say goodbye to your partners. It was good while it lasted. So, Baldwin. You cleaned up the town, huh? And you at the head of the Purity League. That's rich. Good old vice giving way to the march of progress. Let me tell you something. You can drive me out of town with these girls but you can't escape the truth. What truth? I staked you when you first came to this town. And now you've turned on me. That's the kind of rat you are. There's a special name for men that let women stake them. Shall I tell you what it is? All aboard. The mail is on it. Come on. Let's get these females aboard. Come on. Let's get going, girls. That's what you are and you know it. Get out. You and the Purity League. Ha. Well, girls. We are off. There's nothing like travel to broaden the mind. All aboard. All aboard. Goodbye, girls. Alright. I'll show you another one. My very best one. Take a card. Each of you take a card. Quickly. Now, I want you to take these cards up the trail. As far as you can go to the very end and I want you to bury them. Then come back here to me and I'll show you the very same cards. Now run along. Scoot. The cards never fail you, do they Jack. Perhaps they will this time. I am going to show you a trick. A trick with a story. About a queen. Who once knew a very bad man. A gambler perhaps. A reckless sort of fellow. But this queen was so beautiful. That she could make bad men .. Good. And this knave saw in her. The one woman he'd looked for in many women. If one day, sitting under the trees. The knave should find courage to speak of this to the queen. What do you think she would say? That he is not worthless. I know the knave intimately. And I know that if the queen would gamble with the knave. He would wager everything he has that he could become .. The king of hearts. If she will only say as he says now .. 'I love you'. If she is so wonderful. She would have to be truthful. Wouldn't she? You see. My trick has failed. Perhaps it hasn't. Jack. I am sorry I can't say more. Maybe I do love you but .. Why .. I ain't ever even kissed a man, so .. How can I know? Sometimes I .. I think I love you. Think? No, Salomy. When love comes you will know it. Just as surely as you'd know if you were caught up in a cyclone and carried away. I am sorry. That is alright. I guess the cyclone just isn't due today. We hid them. We hid them. You did? What was your card? - Five of diamonds. The five of diamonds? Here it is, right here. What was yours? The four of clubs. - Four of clubs? I have it right here in my hat. There it is. What was Willy's? - Six of spades. Six of spades? He's got it in his pocket. Right here. You didn't hide those cards at all. - We did so. We did. - I checked. You had another pack of cards. This young man will make a name for himself in this part of the country. Salomy, ain't we never going swimming? Yes. We're going right now. Goodbye, Jack. - Goodbye, Salomy. Am I heading straight for Redwood? Two miles. Two miles, you say? Yes. Two miles. Two? Hey. Someone must have lost these. How long have you been there? Long enough. You're mighty brave when there isn't a man around, ain't you? I thought you might be wanting to apologise. Sorry for the way you treated me today? - No. But I'm sorry I wasn't born a boy. Let go of me. - You're mighty fierce. Listen. I want to tell you something. Put me down. Wait a minute. You misunderstand, Miss Salomy. I'm not that kind of animal. You know what I stand for in this community. That last twenty thousand acres I got was practically thrown in. Yes, Mr Clay. People must get up pretty early in the morning to get ahead of me. That's how I come to own all the land and cattle I've got. That is why I ask you if I can have Salomy Jane for my wife. Rufe. Don't you know womenfolk make up their own minds who they're going to marry? The very ones you tell them to marry, they don't. And the very ones you ask them not to marry they do. That's the way of women, Rufe. Well. Here she comes now. You'd better ask her yourself. What were you and dad talking about? I guess you know alright. You are always asking dad about marrying me. But you sort-of make it sound like business instead of love. That ain't so. I'm crazy to have you. I can't stand when I see another man looking at you, even. What would you do if I was going to marry you .. And one of them insulted me? I would kill him. Alright then. Kill Baldwin. Then I will marry you. Kill Baldwin? Look at that. I can't even tell you what he said. It sort-of spoiled everything for me. I can't ever be the same again while he's around to remind me of it. Those dirty eyes of his. You don't know what you're asking me. Don't think I like asking you. But I can't go to dad because he's got that Larabee on his hands. But you could do it clean .. - Baldwin was likely drunk. I knew you would crawl out of it. - I ain't. But supposing Baldwin denies it? You wouldn't talk about it, would you? I couldn't walk up to him and kill him without explaining why. Couldn't you say: 'You've insulted the girl I'm going to marry'? And let those be the last words he'd ever hear. You would marry me then? If you tried. Well, I'll think about it. Wait. Don't you ever speak to me again while Baldwin is alive. There comes Yuba Bill's coach. Yeah. Something's gone wrong. Boys, grab hold of them leaders, will you. Where is the sheriff? Yuba. How am I going to get down? Jump, sister. You can't miss the ground. Where's the sheriff? Where is the sheriff? - Inside. Sheriff. Sheriff. The stage has been held up. Tell us about it. How did it happen? - I tell you .. We just come down off the hill and rattled down into Dry Gulch. We were swinging along kinda nice and easy. I was telling Millie a little story .. - I don't want to listen to that again. We'll pass that. Go ahead. As I said, we were just swinging along nice and easy and going into the turn. When a masked figure stepped out in front .. And levelled his gun right at my hat and he says .. Stick 'em up! Naturally, that just set them ponies crazy. And the women started screaming and just as I was going for my gun. You didn't have to go any place for it. It was laying in your lap. Pay no attention to her. I was pretty busy for a couple of minutes watching that team. When I turned and looked, here was this bandit a-stripping of these women. What? - Of their jewelry. So. I turned around and about that time these two fillies I got up in front .. Baby and Pansy. They got nervous and they got to milling around and whinnying. They go .. [ Horse noises ] They knowed something was wrong, you know. Just knowing, see. Well, old Baldy .. He kinda turned towards them. He always answered to them mares. So he turned and said .. [ Horse noises ] That started off this young stud horse. You know that young stud horse? That young wheel horse. He heard old Baldy going and he don't want to be outdone. The first thing he does. He turned on high and he says .. [ Horse noises ] Before I know it, he'd gone that far. So I just tied up their reins. Boys, I'm telling you. A nice long drink. Joe. Is that how it happened? - Not a word of truth in it. We were walking along at an easy pace. When all of a sudden a bandit come out and he says timid-like: 'stick 'em up'. Yuba Bill rolled right off his seat and ran into the bushes. After the bandit has relieved us of all our hard-earned jewelry. I picked up the reins and drove the horses back about half a mile. Where we picked up Yuba Bill still running. It was all a joke. Except I lost the only piece of jewelry I had any sentiment about. It was an onyx bracelet. Given to me by my first and only decent husband. The fellow responsible for this hold-up. Is going to hang sure. Jack. Are you trying to run my character down in this here community? I can't run down what you haven't got. I don't blame them for running your kind of women out of here. My kind of women? You don't know nothing about my kind of women. I am going to when I get older. Well, boys. Here is our next mayor. As you know this fellow Baldwin so well, can you tell me where I can find him? Sure. He is upstairs. Rooms 10, 11 and 12. And for your information. He is the leading citizen of this community. And just as honest as the day is long. Thanks. And for your information there's nothing honest or upright about that rat. And I've come three thousand miles to tell him so. Your friends downstairs might come running if I smash in the door, Baldwin. You wouldn't want them to hear what I've got to say. Are you crazy? I've been almost crazy. But I am feeling better now. What's come over you? The last time I saw you, you were friendly enough. That was before my furlough was up. Before I had to go back to fighting. And leave my little sister without any of her menfolk around. You .. You don't think that I .. - Don't waste my time. You have got a gun? What for? I ain't partial to killing even a skunk in cold blood. There is a nice, quiet little spot down the road. I'm not entering any shooting match. Get your gun. I haven't got one. I was sort-of prepared to hear you say that. Just a minute. I'll just keep this until we get there. I'm sorry to have to say this to you but .. But I guess there's no other way out. There is no way out. You think I'll run the risk of killing a fine, upstanding fellow .. Just because he doesn't know anything about women? What are you getting at? There is no one man responsible. For your sister having killed herself. You .. - Wait. If I was not broken-hearted too. Would I have her picture on the wall? Ah, I'll fix you up great. Keep off of me. - We ain't touching you. You're breathing on me. How can I figure when you're breathing on me? We ain't breathing on you. - I tell you. You're always breathing on me. Hello. Look, aunt Salomy. - What you doing? I was just fixing this for Anna May. Why, it's a bracelet. Where did you get it? Pa gave it to Ma and Anna May snitched it. I never. I just borrowed it. It's right pretty. You'd better take it right back to your Ma. I will when I go home. You wear it until then, Salomy. Yes. Wear it. I know where Salomy goes. Salomy. This is no place for you, child. Go on now. Like a good girl. Go on. This holding up the stagecoach is the last straw. We're going to hang the man that done it before sundown. And we're going to vote for Baldwin at the election too. We can depend on him to keep this from happening anymore. I'm afraid we can't. Careful what you say about Baldwin, Marbury. I still say we can't depend on Baldwin for anything. He's just been killed. What? - Killed? Who done it? A stranger. We never saw him before. Did they catch him? - No. They shot his horse from under him. But he made a clean getaway. He's hiding in the brush somewhere. There will be a double hanging today. - Why? What? - I said: 'Why'? About the one that killed Baldwin. Why don't you give him a chance to prove something? I don't doubt he had a reason. We'll ask him when we get the rope around his neck. Baldwin has needed killing for some time. We begin by you men dropping into a hat .. The name of the man you think held up the stage. Alright, men. Salomy. Where did you get that bracelet? One of Red Pete's little girls had it. What is it, Yuba? What about the bracelet? - Sheriff. That bracelet there. Was took off one of the women when the stage was robbed. Red Pete's kid? Never mind about the name in the hat, men. What do you mean, sheriff? I mean it was Red Pete who held you up, Yuba. No. He would not dare. - Why not? Red Pete know that for him to hold me up .. Would be just the same as him committing suicide. Where you going, young lady? - I just found this old bracelet. Anyway, Yuba got me kinda confused. Anna May. You kids come here. That ain't fair. They're just babies. Willy. Do you know where Salomy got this bracelet she was wearing? She got it from Anna May. Where did you get it, Anna May? - Don't tell him, Anna May. Go ahead, Anna May. Where did you get it? Well. Pa gave it to Ma. And I wanted to play with it. - Hush, honey. You kids run along home. You've played long enough. Alright, men. Sheriff. Listen to me. Red Pete never done it. But if he did it's because he's just plumb crazy. Listen. Let's just forget all about it. A nice kid, Yuba. But they picked a bad father. I'll try to warn Red Pete. Thanks, Jack. You better not talk to me, Rufe Waters. Why not? Baldwin is dead. - I knew you'd say that. In a week you'll be telling me you'd have done it if the stranger hadn't. I wish I knew for certain what he looked like. You will. When I've got him hanging from a limb. How about you come with me? While we're getting Red Pete, the rest of you string along with Rufe. You're the one who killed Baldwin. Yes. - Look. It's 14 miles straight west to the county line. That's what I wanted to know. Maybe I have a chance. Keep away from the road. - I will. Why did you kill him? It's something I would rather not talk about. Was it .. On account of a woman? Yes. A girl. I like you, man. - And I like you. I heard you sticking up for me which is why I took a chance on speaking to you. You didn't take no chance. What are you standing there for? You've got to hurry. They'll be after you any minute. Yes. I had better be going. Somehow, I wished I'd met you when things were different. So do I. Pete is out after a deer. When we hear the shot we've got him. What you crying for, Ma? Why don't you tell us, Ma? Where's Pete? - He ain't here. Where is he? The vigilantes want him. If they catch him, they hang him. Is there a way to give him a warning? Maybe I can find Pete before they do. Maybe I can help him get away. - This might help. And it belongs to you. - How? Pete won it the other night. He'd been drinking and he let it ride. It's a hundred-odd. You are lying. Bless you. There ain't no pride when it comes to my man. God, maybe I can catch him. Lize .. Lize. Hurry. And don't worry about the kids. I'll take care of them. The sheriff beat me here but Red Pete's still got a chance. Peter. Pete! Pete. [ Gunshot! ] You can drop that, Pete. You won't be needing it. Chet, get his gun. Come on, Pete. Hello. - Hi, Yuba. I've been talking to Santa Claus about you children. He wants me to bring him up here to see you children on the street. Are we going to see Santa Claus? Lize, maybe it ain't Red Pete. Maybe. It's the one that killed Baldwin. Yes. Maybe it was the stranger. I know it would have took more than one shot to down Red Pete. Lize. Is supper ready? I kinda brought a crowd with me. Pete. Are they going to hang him? Yes. And the one that killed Baldwin too. Did they get him? Not yet. He won't get far. Rufe Waters and his hounds that are tracking him. Hello Pa. Hi, son. When are you going to get me that yellow dog? Well. I was .. I was kinda fixing to. Yuba's getting him now. Will he have a nice long tail? He sure will. You promise? I promise. Run along now. Come out you. That's him. Tie him, men. Bring him down to Red Pete. We got him alright. How do you know you got the right man? It's the soldier who was passing through here. Anyway, the boys seen him do it. What are you doing around here? Nothing. Then you ain't denying that you killed Baldwin. I ain't saying anything. Tell him why you did it. Won't you? Please. They wouldn't believe anything that I said about Baldwin. They're going to believe what I say about him. He's been fooling all of you. Making out like he was a saint. When all the while there was not a woman safe from him. I got reason to know. What are you talking about? This. Maybe this man killed Baldwin for .. For something like the same reason. It seems to me like you're mighty interested in saving this stranger. Come on, boys. We're wasting time. No. Wait. I won't let you do this. I will .. - Please. What's the use? Pete. If you've got anything you want to say to your wife. You had better say it. Yes. And we'll give you just about one minute. What have you got to say about this? I never knew you to take no chance. Pete took a chance to get money for his wife and kids. Lize, hush. I don't you to tell me what to do neither. Do you hear? I always said you couldn't rob no coach and get away with it. I wanted you to go to work but no. Sheriff, I hope you ain't waiting because you think I want you to. Don't be a dog. They're all dogs. All of you. Hounds. Hounds. Stranger. Ain't you got anything to say? Any goodbyes to send to anybody? Nobody. Well, honey. After all the fuss you've been making. Ain't you going to say goodbye to a man .. That ain't got nobody in the whole world? Goodbye, man. I am sorry. Thanks. For everything. Good girl. Come on, Pete. Well. Keep going, stranger. Ain't you coming, Marbury? No. I guess not. Well? I ain't no worse than a murderer, am I? What do you mean? I want you to kiss me like that. Will you? - Yes. When I'm sure you're going to be hung. One of you get under there. It don't matter which. I'll go first. I'm ready. I ain't got nothing I want to keep on thinking about. Seems like you have. Pete. I tried to make them believe that you wasn't the one. It was me alright. Yuba. If you come across a yellow dog. With a long tail. Give it to that boy of mine. Will you? I'd hate to have him think I broke my promise to him. [ Gunshots! ] You seem upset, Salomy. It's just that singing, dad. It keeps making me think about .. About Red Pete. Being dead and everything. You're sure it's Red Pete you're worrying about? Good evening. - Glad to see you, Jack. Don't tell me about it. I don't want to hear it. I didn't go to the hanging, Salomy. I just dropped by to tell you something I overhead, Mr Clay. Larabee threatens there will be a burial here before Red Pete's in the ground. Dad. Thanks, Jack. You'd better stay close to the house tonight. I guess I'll have to. The sheriff told me I couldn't kill him and get away with it. Howdy, Yuba. - Hello folks. Ain't it a dandy? The closest thing I could find to a yellow dog. I got him down at Rick's place. You got it for Willy. Yes. A keen smeller too. You look as if you've run all the way here, Yuba. Yes I did. And I'll tell you why. There was a certain happening, as it was. I feel indebted to this family. Especially the female member of it. What is it? You know that stranger that Salomy kissed? Just as they were about to hang him he made his getaway. He did? He sure did. - Did they catch him? Catch him? I never seen such a rider in my life. Yuba. Mammy Lou. Mammy Lou. That stranger got away. He's alive. He's alive. - Are you sure, Miss Salomy? Yes. Yuba just told me. They had the stranger all ready on the horse underneath the limb, see. With his hands tied behind him. Just about to flip the loop around his neck. And he busted his hands loose and quick as lightning kicked his horse .. And knocked old George down and .. Right out he went. Well, sir. It happened so pretty that before I knew it .. I caught myself cheering for the stranger to get away. I turned and saw the sheriff. He put the fish-eye on me. So I kinda tightened up. It happened so sudden like that everybody kinda froze. The first man to get limbered up was old Jack Pagget. By the time he got his gun working. The stranger and his horse had disappeared plumb out of sight. Now. Look at that. Dog babies are all alike, ain't they. I guess I won't get to see that widow. Did I ever tell you about .. Yuba. You sit right down and tell me all about the stranger. Well, Salomy. Never before in my whole life did I see such downright nerve as I seen today. Excepting one time about ten years ago. When I was chasing a desperate horse thief and I had my hand on my gun .. They won't get him again? Will they, Yuba? - Well, I don't know. They was organised when I left. And Rufe Waters had put his hounds on the trail. I could kill that Rufe. Salomy. I bet you and Jack would not help hang a man. That would depend. Depend on what? If it were anyone who meant unhappiness to a girl like you .. I don't doubt we'd both be glad to hang him. Is that right, Mr Clay? - It sure is. Yuba. Stay here until I get back. I have a sick horse down at the corral. Daddy. You can't go down to the corral again tonight. Larabee is out gunning for him. Madison, don't you take no chances. I'll go down and look after that horse. Thanks, Yuba. Daddy, please go in the house. - To the devil with Larabee. He wouldn't dare come to this house. - He had better not. But if he does. And I have a gun handy .. - Now, Salomy. You keep out of this. Goodnight, Jack. - Goodnight, Mr Clay. I wonder where he is. Who's that? I guess I'll be moving along. You two hear or see anybody? - No. No. Did you see someone? - I was down in the shed with the horse. I thought I heard somebody and said: 'Who's that'? I went for my gun and I heard him go. Right off through the brush. I think I'd better stay around here tonight, Salomy. It's alright, Jack. Dad will keep to the house. Just as you say. Ready, Yuba? Yes. Come on, Trigger. Tell your Pa that old party will pull through alright. Thanks, Yuba. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Night. Then it was you down by the corral? - Yes. I am glad you got away. It was your kiss that put the heart in me to do it. Who was she? The one you killed Baldwin for? My sister. She is dead. Why didn't you tell them? Would you want to tell it? If someone belonged to you. You mustn't waste any more time around here. They will be after you. - They won't get me. Not if you put heart into me again. Like you did before. They might have hung you. If they had I'd have come back to you. From the moonbeams. I like you better this way. Quick. Put these on. Anybody seeing you will think it's dad. Lie down here. Pretend you're asleep. Evening. - Shush. Dad's all tuckered out. What are you doing around here anyway? Looking for a murderer. Why don't you look at yourself? You're trying hard not to be one. You asked me to kill Baldwin. This man likely means you no more good than he did. He don't mean anything to me. No? Well. He was heading this way. Yes? - Yes. A fine thing. Kissing a stranger with a whole crowd looking on. You wouldn't want me to do it with no-one looking, would you? You very likely did. No girl ever kisses a man that way the first time. Hush. I don't want to wake dad up. What are you doing here? Maybe the same thing you are, Rufe. I thought your dad had gone to bed. I thought you had. I got to thinking about Larabee. I figured no matter what you said, your dad rests easier if he knows I'm around. You got no call to worry about Larabee tonight. He's gone to the crossroads first. Just the same, I think I'll stay. Well. Maybe it's a good idea at that, Marbury. In case another caller drops around. Before my hounds pick up his trail again. Why are you so set on staying, Jack? If Larabee's at the crossroads there's no need. I'm here to guard you, Salomy. Not your dad. Why do I need guarding? On account of Baldwin's murderer. You don't think that about him? That he's a murderer. Salomy, you've never seen this man before today. None of us have. He's got you so there isn't any way he couldn't take advantage of you. He wouldn't. I don't know that. There ain't much danger of us trying. Seeing as he's miles away from here by now. No he isn't. He is very close. You are dreaming. I haven't watched men gamble all my life without learning some signs. What do you mean? You're holding a tough hand, Salomy. Am I? There must be a looking-glass behind me. No. But there's a man behind you. In the house somewhere. Think so? Go in and see. I think you're bluffing. I call. Salomy. I left my hat and coat down there. Bring them in when you come, will you? Yes, daddy. Get up. Put that down. Stand back. And don't think you can hide behind her. I'm not hiding behind anyone. Jack. You're not turning him over to the others? I am, Salomy. Jack. Rufe will be back any minute. - I know. Even if they do get him. I won't have any love to give you. I let you know that already, Jack. What if it does turn out all wrong? And he don't love me like he ought to. What if I don't get enough to eat or a place to sleep? Or anything? What if he's like Red Pete was to Lize? I love him like that. Don't that make him right for me? Swap boots with me quick. It will put the hounds off your trail. Hurry. Out that way quick. Avoid the highway. - I will. It would take more time than I have to thank you properly. Hurry. My. It's hard to tell which one is Rufe. - I thought we'd track him here. You helped him get away. Switched boots with him. Let her make a fool out of you. Come outside and say that, Rufe. I'll get him first. Then I'll settle with you. Don't you think I won't. What makes you sure you'll get him? Larabee is watching at the crossroads. We got our men spotted all around. He'll not make another escape. Stop where you are, Madison Clay. [ Gunshot! ] Man. Man. Man! Man. What are you doing out here all by yourself? I heard shots. I thought they'd got you. A man named Larabee mistook me for your dad. I had to shoot before he did. Did you .. get him? Yes. Then what are you hanging around for? I hid in the brush and heard his friends planning to hang your dad for it. Oh. The only way I can save him is to give myself up. No, no. We've got to hurry back, honey. I'd run on for miles before I realized what I was doing. Dad will beat them some way. I won't let you go back to die. I won't let you. Madison. Madison. What's got you here at this hour, Yuba? - Listen. They're coming here to get you for killing Larabee. Sam's saddling your horse and your only chance is to get over the county line. I didn't kill Larabee. I didn't even know he was dead. You don't have to pretend none with me. Besides, just before he died he told them it was you that done it. Then he was lying. I haven't left the house. He is just trying to .. Sam. Did you take my hat and coat off the porch? No, sir. I did not, master Clay. Salomy. Salomy. What did you do with my hat and coat? Miss Salomy's bed ain't been slept in all night. She ain't been here. Alright now. Hurry up, Sam. - Yes, sir. Yuba. I didn't kill Larabee. But I'm afraid I know who did. - Who? Salomy. She said she was going to. It looks like she took my hat and coat and went to get him. It would be just like her. She's likely hiding. Afraid to face me. Yuba. I did kill that rat. Of course you did, Madison. It couldn't be no other way. Suppose we should go away together. And they hung your dad for something I done. Would you love me then? I couldn't help loving you. Yes you could. It's no use. We're going back to the house. To wait for them. - Oh no. I wish they'd hung me yesterday before you got to feeling like this. Don't you wish that. If they hang you before sunset. I'll thank god all my life for knowing you. Salomy. You ready? You are right. We'll go back and face them. Together. Are you coming with us to get Clay or not? Rufe and I have given up man-hunting for a spell. Haven't we, Rufe? I wouldn't go after Clay anyway. No. We know he didn't kill Larabee. I've sworn to you he was at home when the shot was fired. There ain't nothing you wouldn't swear to if that girl of his asked you to. The both of you. Not me. I suppose you didn't stop tracking that stranger because she talked you into it? A fine time for you to be getting so soft-hearted. You can't do better than play cards when the county's overrun with lawlessness. Come on, sheriff. We don't want to give Clay more time to get over the line. I hope Yuba has gotten some word to him. Go on. Soft-hearted. Deal. Salomy. Salomy. - It's Yuba. For chrissakes, I've been looking all over for you. It looks like that kiss of yours kinda took, Salomy. I guess you don't know nothing about it. Your dad had to shoot Larabee in self defense. Mr Clay didn't kill Larabee. I suppose Salomy done told you that she did it? I didn't shoot Larabee. I did it. Maybe I did it. Or Yellow here did it. What are we playing, games? He's telling the truth, Yuba. He's just going back to give himself up. To save dad. Now that's mighty noble of you, young man. But it's plumb silly. Your dad is safe over the line by now. Yuba. Yes. And you two had better follow him as quick as you can. Take Yellow here. He'll take you both. He's used to packing me. I'll see you the next trip you make, Yuba. Thanks. Alright now. Hurry up. Get going. Why, you flat-faced old hellion. You ain't got no business to be a-hooting at them. There ain't no finer girl in the whole world than Salomy Jane. And she's got a mighty brave young man there too. He kinda makes me think of myself in some way or another. He ain't afraid of nothing in the whole .. Here is the county line. Say, man. What is your name? ..f-s..
