The price is still too low. -175! -180! 190! 190 ryo now! 195. 200. 200 ryo! Anyone? Anyone? Congratulations. Here is the next one! Do you want to buy this horse? This is a high quality horse. It is a Norman breed that can pull heavy loads. Can he really pull that heavy a load? Yes, I guarantee. Hey old man! Huh? How about for this much? What do you say? Give me some discount. You got it! It's yours. I'm selling it for less than what it is worth. How about this horse? This is a fine horse. This is the last one to sell. This horse is too good for farm work. Get closer and take a look. It is definitely the best horse. But can you discount 10 more ryo? What? Are you kidding? I am not discounting even a single copper coin.. I, Katayama Yonetaro, never do dishonest business with farmers. So buy it without worrying. Come on, this is the last one! This isn't too bad. Hey Magohachi! I heard you fraudulently sold a lame horse. It is only natural for a horse trader to be fraudulent. If Yone finds out, he will chew you out. Oh, don't tell him about it. Yone-san, you must drink a lot today Your wallet must be full of money I sold 20 horses in less than two hours. All farmers say they can buy horses raised by you without worrying. You are flattering. All right, I will drink all the sake you have here. I was wondering who you were, it is you, Boss Yone! Who are you? I am a 'Geta' (wooden clogs) merchant, Senzo. It was last year, right around... It was at the festival. I came to this area for the first time, and I saw your Sumo match. You are so tough, boss... Have a drink! - Huh? - Come on. Really? Yes, yes. I knew I have seen you before, and I was right. Excuse me for being so blatant, but I became a big fan of yours since I saw your Sumo match. That is true. To prove it, I remember your name as Sumo wrestler. Shall I say that? Are you ready? Are you ready? It is Shima-no-Oto. Boss, you are so tough! Drink more. They serve some Oden too. You go lower then with your right arm, make an overarm throw. That is so refreshing to watch. So you are a wooden clogs‘ merchant. Yes. Show me a few of them. Yes, thank you. Come on! All right. Hey let me in too. We are betting how many clogs he would buy - I say two pairs. - I say three pairs. Idiots, Yone is a generous man. I say five pairs. Hey Magohachi! You look well off. Ah, no! Roku is here. If you are running away you should do it before you are caught. Now at least pay the interest. Roku! This is the horse market for horse traders. A carriage driver shouldn't be here. I am not a carriage driver but I am a moneylender today I need to get paid. -well... Ah... Yone is here too. Hey Yone, if you need some drinking money I will lend you some. What? You bastard. Horse traders would not borrow money from a carriage driver like you. Is that right? Magohachi was not a horse trader? Huh? Hey Mago! Did you borrow money again? I was not going to borrow any but Roku came when I was drinking... Idiot! I warned you many times. Fine, Rokutaro! If you want money so badly I will pay you now! Oh! It is like Yone-san! Everything is settled now. Shut up! Go away now or I will beat you up. I'd rather get paid even if I get hit a few times. -Hey! Roku, - Huh? Drink some horse's piss on the way out. Saké is too good for a carriage driver like you. I don't know why it is, but you and I have always been enemies. You may be better at fighting, but I am smarter than you. What? If you don't agree, come to the Momoya tonight. I will show you the carriage driver's skill. What are you saying? Gambling and horse traders are inseparable. Don't cry afterward. We will have a match! - Even! - Odd! Game! MOMO-YA RESTAURANT Hey how sad! Are we going to be here all night? I heard that it will not be long. They were saying it will end soon. Even! Odd! Game! Yone-san, thank you! So I will take the proceeds for the sale of twenty horses. It is too bad for you, but that's how it is. Be quiet! Come over anytime to get that damn money! Hey Yone, now you know the wisdom of a carriage driver? What? Damn bastard! Yone-san, stop it! Yone-san, stop! You are giving other customers trouble. Shut up, has! Yone, stop! Stop it now! Look, Yuki-san is back now. She will be here soon. Hey I am leaving now. But don't forget about this. If Yone-san gets violent, this place will be demolished. He is coming. You are leaving quietly now. Of course he will. Yuki-san is scary isn't that right? Damn! Who is afraid of that woman? Yone-san, were you going to leave without seeing me? What are you going to do about the bill? I won't let you run away from it. You don't need to yell like that. I will be responsible for all your spending. Shut up! I know... I was going to pay today but that Roku took all my money So you are penniless again? It serves you right, you coward. What? I have been telling you that you would never win against that swindler. What? Swindled? It is too late now. You are an idiot. It is worse being swindled. Hey Yone-san... Take this junk if you are leaving. This would not be used even as security for a loan. Your wife will wear them. Shut up! He came to sell twenty horses and that's all he is bringing back? Yuki, I have been waiting for your return. Let's have drinks together. Swindler! And who has borrowed money from that swindler? The principal and interest would be... I know. I will pay you back. No, it is all right. You don't have to pay me back. But for that... what are you doing? If you want a woman, go to a brothel. Idiot! Bring saké immediately! Hey open. Damn... Hey open! Hey open! Hey open! I am opening. Hey Yone! That's enough. Your wife was resting with asthma. You are an outrageous drunkard. Be quiet. Hey! What's this? This water is awful. No, this is my herbal medicine. Hey you made me drink that awful water so I would stop drinking. What are you saying? I gave up about your drinking a long time ago. I know that it wouldn't change even if I keep complaining about it. What? Damn... You are saying witty things. I will buy you some nice clothes someday That hurts! That hurts, Yone-san! I said that hurts. That hurts, Yone. You are not so bad when I hold you like this. That hurts. Your beard, Yone-san... what are you doing? That's indecent... why? You are my wife. Stop it, Yone-san. I said stop, Yone-san. Daihei is awake now. Daihei is behaving like a spoiled child because I am home. There, there, don't cry I know. I know. You are crying because I can't give you any milk. Please forgive me. I am always sick. There, there... There, there. Daddy will hold you now. There! It is cold. No, Daihei is tough. There! Up in the air! There! Up in the air! Up in the air! Listen Daihei, you are Daddy's precious child. You will become a fine horse trader. I will make you the best horse trader in Japan. There! Yone-san, where is Daihei's milk? That milk I asked you to buy I forgot. You bought this many wooden clogs and forgot about milk? I forgot! Yone-san, where are the proceeds from the horses? Where is the money from the twenty horses? It is gone. Gone? What do you mean? You gambled again? Hey! I bought you clogs. These are fine clogs. There! They are for you. These are for Daihei. Hey try putting them on, Daihei. How are they? What does he need the clogs for? You are... Don't whimper. Hey Daihei! You will wear these when you become three. These... when you are five. These are really huge. You will wear these when you go to school. What are you going to do about Daihei's milk? I am too sick to give milk. Poor Daihei... Be quiet. Don't worry about it. So I will get some milk. All right. Hey old man! Yone-san... Are you asleep? Hey baldheaded Ogasawara! Aren't you home? Damn, he must be deaf. Yone-san, you shouldn't yell so loudly this late at night. Hey! What is it? You sold all your horses and lost it all at gambling again? Huh? When did you tell him? Idiot! I can hear every quarrel at your place. Go get the milk now. Here. You are fussy! He still loves his child. He ran to get it. Sir... Hey it seems that those horse traders are leaving the mountain soon. Is that right? They should have plenty of money after receiving the payments. We should not let them leave the mountain like that. Yes. Then how about tonight? Place your bet! - Even! - Odd! Game! Hey stop that sham! Stop joking now! Yone, you may get hurt. Bastard! Hey Roku! You have been swindling horse trader's money! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Be quiet! Yone-san! Yone-san! It is urgent! Hurry Haruno-san is in critical condition. Listen, Haruno-san is in critical condition. Huh? Bastard! Yone-san! Idiot! What happened to Yone's wife? She is in critical condition. Haruno-san is dying. What do we do? Yone-san! must go there. - Hurry and get the carriage ready - Yes. What do we do? Yone-san's wife is dying... Don't worry this man is incredibly tough. Yone-san! Yone-san! Ichimatsu, is Yone all right? Yes! Yone-san! Yone-san! Hey Roku. wait for us! We are not fighting now! Hey! Hey! Roku, wait! Yone-san!

Pull yourself together! Damn! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! Hey Roku! where is this carriage heading for? We are heading for your home in a hurry Yone-san! Yone-san! Hey Roku, stop! Stop it now! Your wife is. Stop it, bastard! Yone! Yone! Yone! Jump onto this horse. We will take the shortcut. Are you ready? All right, here I go! Yone, go left! Left! Left is the shortcut! Is it Yone? Haruno! Haruno! -Ah!Ah! Don't die! Yone-san, I am glad you came back. Haruno, don't die! Please don't die. Yone-san, take good care of Daihei. I wanted to live a little longer with you and Daihei. But I... must... go now. Haruno! Yone-san, a child always models himself after his parents. So please no more fighting or gambling for Daihei's sake. That is my only wish... Haruno! I understand. I understand. Yone-san, please let me wear those clogs. I am going to wear the clogs you bought me as souvenir. All right. Are these the ones? You want to wear them? Yone-san, you bawled me out many times, but they did not hurt me. I was still happy I was happy.- Haruno! Haruno! Haruno! Ham... Damn it! Haruno! Why are you dying? Yone-san... Yone-san... Yone-san... Be quiet! You quack! You let her... Stop! Stop! Yone-san! Yone-san! Yone-san! That's enough foolishness! What did your wife just say to you? Idiot! Understand? Understand? Haruno, I understand. I will never fight or gamble even if that kills me. Yone... Look what Haruno-san is holding. There... She worried about Daihei so much she saved this money without telling you. She sweated blood to save this money She wanted to use that money for Daihei's school or something. There... "PLEASE TAKE CARE OF DAIHEI." Daihei! You have me. You have me! It is crowded with people here! Hey Hey I will buy you this. Hey Daihei, let's go see monkeys. You don't want those. Only extravagant fools ride those. Let's go see monkeys. Let's go see Sumo next. There! Sumo is fun. Can you see, huh? Yone-san! Yone-san, you don't have to run away from me. I wouldn't remind you of a debt at the festival. Ah, Dai-bo! He grew so much. Why don't you let me hold him? I will watch him so go ahead and get in a Sumo match or something. I can't this year. Ichimatsu hit me with full force and hurt my right arm. This is the first time I've heard you whimper. So you can't use your overarm throw? Yone! Yone! Sadaji! It is too bad but you can't win three matches in a row this year. Besides, Roku brought this former Sumo wrestler from Abashiri who is really tough. It is upsetting. Damn! Sadaji, what is that? That is the prize for winning three matches in a row. A tricycle and a studying desk... It is the special prize for winning three matches in a row. Sadaji, you have a loincloth? Are you going to do it? Is your arm all right? Yes, it is all right. Yuki, would you hold Daihei? Oh, Shima-no-Oto... Are you going to do it? Wait, wait! Start! Go! Get him! Yone-san is up. Yone-san! Oh! Shima-no-Oto! Yone-san! Shima-no-Oto! This side, Toranishiki! Toranishiki! This side, Shima-no-Oto! Shima-no-Oto! Ready... Ready... wait, wait, wait. Too early! Shima-no-Oto! Over-arm throw! Your favorite trick! Toranishiki, calm down. Ready... wait, wait, wait, start! The second match! This side, Kumanobori! Kuma, go get him! Kumanobori versus Shima-no-Oto! Shima-no-Oto! Yone-san! Do your best! Kuma! Yone-san! Wait, wait, wait, start! Good! He got the over-arm hold! Yone, over-arm throw! Are you all right? Shit! The third match! This side, Shima-no-Oto! Shima-no-Oto versus Kitamigawa! Kitamigawa! Hold down his left side. He can't pull with his right arm anymore. Kitamigawa! Shima-no-Oto! Go for it! Ready! Kitamigawa! Shima-no-Oto! Watch out for the arm. Over-arm throw! -wait... Too early! Kitamigawa! Lock up his right arm. Listen, if he tries to pull with his right arm, just lock it up firmly Ready! Kitamigawa! Kitamigawa! Go for it! Wait, wait, wait... Shima-no-Oto! Wait, wait, wait... Start! Yone-san, hang on! Go! Go! Yone-san! Over-arm throw! Over-arm throw! Take that arm! Yone-san, watch out! Daddy! Daddy! On March 20th, the snow finally stopped. The field, the mountain, and the village roads are all covered with silver snow. As I am writing my diary on the veranda, my father is weaving straw boots. Daihei. Father means Daddy huh? That rascal called me Father... But they say "Father" instead of Daddy That's right. I know that. A lit... literate man uses that word. Daddy how do I write the letter "father"? Huh? Idiot! Your teacher will scold you for asking Daddy I will be quiet so keep reading the rest. In the stable, a colt named Fushimi is eating dried grass. My father bought the colt Fushimi for me because I became the class president. And I will cherish Fushimi so that he will grow up to become a fine horse. That's right. You will not become a good horse trader if you don't cherish horses. Daihei, let's eat. I will take you to the singing show tonight. Hello! Ah! It is Auntie... Tell her that I am away But you always tell me not to lie. That's a different matter, idiot! Yone-san, what are you doing? I am inspecting for bugs. Dai-bo I got something you like. - Auntie. - Huh? How do I write the letter for "father"? How to write...? I am a little busy... Yone-san, when are you going to pay? Cut it out! You are nice only when you want to drink. But you're mean when you have to pay? Besides you don't need to embarrass me by making him ask about writing. You don't need to take it out on me. So you are not so good at writing either? We are in the same boat. How annoying! He is playing his radio again! Hey! It's noisy! Turn it off! Hey Yone! We are neighbors. Don't be so selfish. Listen, Yone-san... Let's stop fighting. We have known each other for a long time. Loaned money is not that important. I came all the way to Hokkaido and I have lots of debt, so I can't lecture about it to anyone. But I just want to say to you to be more levelheaded. Yone-san, Kosaka Roku is finally running to be a member of the town assembly Huh? Roku is? Yes. He is going to make a campaign speech at the town hall tonight. So he had the singing show cancelled. That stupid idiot... The loan shark is giving a speech to raise his interest rate? Yes, probably... Hey Roku is not so decent, but still better than you horse traders. What did you say? That's right. You guys always just complain. Try giving a speech once. Everyone! This is why I am running for the town assembly Spending money does not necessarily improve the town. That's right! That's right! The town will grow only when it earns money That's right! I don't mean to brag, but I, Kosaka Rokutaro, never spent my money on something that does not earn any profit. That's great! The reason I insist on money is... Please listen everyone... There are deep reasons for that... Please be quiet! Please be quiet! The reason I insist on money is. You make money so you can afford a mistress! Hey how about me? No, not her. He wants Yuki! Shut up! What? Damn you! Be quiet! Everyone be quiet! It does not matter who would become Roku's mistress. Listen to what he has to say! That's right! Whatever we listen to makes no difference. Farmers are always taken in by horse traders and carriage drivers. Bastard! Shut up! Be quiet! Listen! The reason I insist on money is... Ah! Shut up! What did you say? Be quiet! The reason I insist on money is... "Going to places with friends..." Everyone, read together. "Study hard and play hard." Good. The snow has finally melted. Everyone, study hard. That's all for today Stand up! Bow! Hey Daihei! Don't act so big! You are just the son of a horse trader. You will be a horse! Bastard! Damn! -Stop it! Oh, it's Daihei. What's the matter? Stop crying Are you hurt? You are all right. Hey don't cry All right, you will ride on my bicycle. Come on. Hey don't cry Daihei, I heard you are doing well in school. Yes. That's good. You must always exceed other people. Yes. To exceed other people doesn't mean that you have to fight with them. I always believed that as long as I make a lot of money people would not be disrespectful toward me. So I work very hard to earn money I don't care if people are laughing at me as long as I earn money Daihei, that is exceeding other people. Yes... - Did you understand? - I didn't understand. -You didn't... Your daddy probably doesn't either. - "Young girl is..." Check! Ah! It is sad losing your king. Sometimes you have to lose to win. That is smarter, huh? Daihei! How old are you now? Huh? Wash your own feet! Yone! Don't yell at him. Leave us alone. I am talking to Daihei. Huh? Did you fight? Did you win? You lost? Go back there now! Take this and go. Yone, take it easy Listen Yone, I wanted to talk to you. Would you let me take Daihei? what? He is too extraordinary for you. I will provide him with an education. Don't be silly! I wouldn't give my son to a loan shark. Daihei, I can't talk to a real blockhead. Get lost now! You have a fine father. You are lucky Stop your nonsense! Shithead! Daihei, what are you waiting for? Go avenge yourself now! You coward! Are you afraid? Keep standing there if you are afraid. Stand there all night long! Ah! He came back! Bastard! Bastard! Yone-san, I heard Dai-bo got hurt. No, nothing serious. Daihei, it doesn't hurt, does it? No. That's right. A fine horse trader would not be bothered by something like that. Huh? Are you going to make Dai-bo a horse trader? That's right. A horse trader's son will become a horse trader. But I hear he is doing well in school. what? Are you saying that he should become a loan shark like Roku? Hey Dai-bo, I got you some balloons you wanted. Yes. And your favorite treat. Thank you. Does that hurt? No. That's good. Hey you don't like Kosaka, do you? Yes, he is a merciless loan shark. He is like a leech exploiting farmers. But how different are loan sharks from horse traders? what? You bitch! A farmer was saying that too. Although you don't do any dishonest business, all other horse traders are. Bastard, what did you come here for? I want you to hit me once. what are you saying? Hey strike me in the way I feel refreshed. That's all I want. Creepy woman! I know I am persistent. I am going to stay this way till I die. what do you mean? what? what are you talking about? How dare you say that! Idiot! Blockhead! Women can't answer that. You will live to a ripe old age without knowing anything. Just leave me alone. You have to pay up before the end of the month. You penniless blockhead! what? It flew away? No, I sent a letter to Mommy Huh? You sent a letter to Mommy? Yes. But Mommy died. But she is there above that cloud. She is in the heaven above the clouds. what did you say to Mommy? Huh? What did you write? I want to go to school... That's what I wrote. School? I want to go to the middle school. SHINNYO (Common posthumous Buddhist name for women.) Daihei.. Yes. So you want to go to a higher school? Yes. The middle school in Sapporo? Yes. Sapporo is far away Yes. You want to go although you have to part with me? Huh? All right, Daihei... You are going to the middle school. - Really? - Yes. You will go to school and become a great man. Mommy will be happy too. But it takes money to go to school. I am poor and don't have much money but Fushimi will send you to a higher school. Are you going to sell Fushimi? No, I won't sell. We bought Fushimi with the money left by Mommy we will never sell him. He is a fine horse. If I raise him with the best care, he'll win a race at the Kitami race track before you're ready to go to middle school. Daihei, you will go to the school with that prize money Daddy shall we eat? Huh? Yes... Does it hurt here? Yes. Daihei, you will finally be graduating. Yes. Fushimi became a fine horse. A fine horse. Do you want to eat? I am going to the restroom. MOMO-YA RESTAURANT KOSAKA ROKUTARO'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS Ah, it is Cold! So this place is Kosaka Rokutaro's campaign headquarters now... He will be defeated. Let's go! Go horne and go to bed early we will have a busy day tomorrow. Ah, it is Yone-san! You only visit when you want to drink saké. Everyone else has gone now. ls the campaign headquarters busy? Yes. I was asked to do this last year and I have been very busy would you like a drink? It is not good for your neuralgia. Huh? Yes... Roku-san was saying that if he wins a seat at the prefectural assembly he will aim for a seat in the Diet next. -Oh... ls Roku still trying to seduce you? He is persistent. - Yuki... - Huh? I need to beg you for a favor. How much do you need? No, it is not money To tell you the truth, I am thinking about getting myself a wife. Huh? when I think about Daihei, I think it is better that way Yone-san, come this way You are dressed so grubby Come up... I thought hard about it until now. I could not even sleep at night. Don't be like a stranger. Don't drink alone. Give me some too. Hey Yuki... what? ls there a woman like that? I don't know. A woman with some education, who can read and write... A woman who can be someone to talk to for Daihei when he becomes a middle school student. Idiot! Idiot! What are you talking about? That's enough! Blockhead! what is it? I just came to ask you to find me a wife. Shut up! Leave now! Who would be the wife of a horse trader? That's why I am asking you to find one. Leave! And never come back! Idiot! Blockhead! Ha! Idiot! Damn... Old maid! Yuki-chan, what's the matter? The old maid got moldy Ah, Daddy! Daddy! Fushimi is ill! Fushimi is ill! - What? - Hurry! Hurry Ah, Fushimi! What's the matter? Huh? What's the matter? Open your mouth. This is not good. Daihei, go get the doctor! Hurry! Yes. well, that's all right. I will wait for another month. But you must pay the amount including the principal and interest next time. Yes, I will work hard. Excuse me. So you are asking me to pay for Daihei's education? Yes, if that is possible. No, it is not. You have earned enough money to feed horses with. I have never spent my money without getting a return. Besides, to lend money some collateral is necessary I have that collateral. Oh... what did you bring? Roku-san... It is me. Huh? How about me? Really? Finally... when did you change your mind? Huh? I am like Tokugawa leyasu. I have waited patiently Is that right? what is this? That is for Daihei's education. Now Fushimi is ill, you can't expect to get money for Daihei's education. That loan has no time limit, no interest, and no reminders. I am offering it without any conditions. That's like the man who won the seat at the prefectural assembly You are generous. Daihei.. He is a good boy You must be happy too. I am not happy! I am not happy to borrow money from someone like you! what? Daihei is my son. I will manage to send him to the school. You are an inflexible blockhead. Are you going to be stubborn? Shut up! Go away! Horse traders have pride! He refused the money... Of course he did. Horse traders can't borrow money from carriage drivers. That's true. If Fushimi doesn't recover, we have to give up. Daihei will have to give up going to the school. Horse traders' sons should become horse traders. Is that right? Idiots! Yone is a horse trader, but different from you guys. what do you mean? He is the best horse trader in Japan. He lives for horses. And now he is betting on the horse for his son's education. And that is his pride. Hey Fushimi! Pull yourself together. Please send Daihei to the school. You are my only hope. Please stand up. Fushimi, stand up! Come on, please stand up! Fushimi, stand up! Fushimi! Fushimi, get up! Come on! Come on! Get up! Fushimi, stand up! Fushimi, stand up! Stand up! Ah! watch out! Yone-san! Hold on to me. Does it hurt? You are straining yourself. It's good I came. I was worrying about you. Sit here. Are you all right? How did you get inside in the middle of the night? You have no locks or bolts. I just pushed the door and it opened. Why did you refuse Kosaka's loan? Shut up! Bastard, you must be in cahoots with him. Hey Yuki, you are trying to take Daihei away from me by conspiring with Roku. It is not about taking him away Daihei is doing so well in school. Everyone is worried about him not achieving his goal. None of your business. Daihei is my son. Leave us alone! Just leave us alone. Yone-san! Yone-san, I understand how you feel. You are that kind of man. But if you insist on doing it yourself, that would eventually hurt you and Dai-bo would not be able to go to school. Yone-san, please listen for Dai-bo... Dai-bo is definitely your son. But should a parent's will determine a person's life? If things stay the way they are, Dai-bo will become a horse trader for sure. Are you letting him become a horse trader when he has such a bright future? Please think hard about that. If you don't like receiving money Dai-bo can pay back twice the amount after he makes it. Shut up! Stop it now. I do appreciate people's kindness and I am weeping in my heart. Even that bastard, Roku, whom I have always fought, offered me that large sum of money I said thanks to Roku in my heart. But I am a great horse trader, Yuki... I don't want any help from other people. You are still being stubborn. A horse trader wants to send his son to school in a horse trader's way If I get help from others, horse trader Yonetards name would be disgraced. Idiot! Blockhead! Is that a real great horse trader? You are too proud although, you are not capable. And you will ruin Dai-bo's future. Shut up! Dai-bo is the one who should be pitied. Because his stupid parent is stubborn he can't go to the school he wants. Shut up! Go away! You would never understand my feelings. Woman, I can't stand you! Yone-san! Shut up, bitch! Go away! Get lost! Go now! Daddy! You shouldn't do that to the lady! You shouldn't! She despises me. Daddy why are you so angry? Auntie likes you, Daddy what are you saying? Go to bed. Go to bed now. Daddy... what? I don't want to go to school. I am your son, so I will become a horse trader. what? Daihei, are you serious about that? I will become a great horse trader like you. Shut up! You... Hey Daihei! I am the greatest horse trader in Japan. You will never be a better horse trader, no matter how hard you try Listen Daihei, don't get discouraged by small troubles. Idiot... One generation of horse traders is enough. But Daihei, you will have to give up if Fushimi does not get up tomorrow. Then you will have to give up about the school. Huh? Tomorrow is the day If Fushimi does not get up tomorrow... Ah! Fushimi will stand up! Look! Look! Fushimi will stand up! Fushimi will stand up! Fushimi! Fushimi! Get up! - Get up! - Fushimi! Get up! Get up! - Get up! - Fushimi! Come on, Fushimi! - Come on! - Get up! Get up! Come on, Fushimi! - Get up! Get up! - Come on, Fushimi! Next is the long-awaited 11th race that is the most talked about race in the area. With the guide horse in front, the horses are entering the field.
