This is Report 105 from Xeno Archaeological Expedition, Team Seven. Documentation Officer Kate Carson reporting. The past two months of survey and research have resulted in the discovery of a vast, tomb-like complex. This structure was unmentioned in any report made by the previous and abandoned expedition to this planet. Entry to the tomb has now been made, and examination of the inner chambers may reveal vital information about the extinction of the previous race that inhabited this planet. Despite the planet's two suns, the surface temperature remains a constant 89 degrees below zero. However, life-support systems and electrical installations in the underground headquarters are fully operational. Safety factor: 60 per cent. Conditions: tolerable. Wait a minute. Will you take a look at that? Dean, shine your torch over here for a minute. This is terrific. Looks like there's another section through here. Listen, Dean, don't wander off too far. No, don't worry, I won't. - I wanna be able to hear you at all times. - Yeah, I'll keep in touch. - Hey, this looks interesting. - Dean, what have you found? - Dean? - Some kind of wall carving. Can you read it? Can you make it out? Means nothing to me. Can you recognise anything on it at all? No. We'll have to get Mitch to figure this one out. Well, listen, don't... don't stay there too long. Come back, and we'll have it checked later. Come back now. - There's something here... - Dean! Ricky? Dean, can you hear me? Dean, what have you found? Ricky? Ricky, can you hear me? - Yeah, what's the matter? - Ricky... Move it! - Hang on. - How long have we got? I don't know. Can you hear me, Ricky? Can you hear me, Ricky? - I'll take him. Come on. - Sandy, get his legs up. - Okay, get him up. Come on. - Come on, Sandy, let's go. Easy. Okay, Sharon, come on, move it. What happened? What about Dean? - I don't know. - Is there much damage? One sector's knocked out out there. Okay, you'd better get back there, too, and see what you can do. The voice communicators don't work in there. Gary, this is Holly. Respond. Gary, will you answer me? Yes, what is it? Did you check the communicators in the suits like you were supposed to? I did. Well, we've had a problem with the tomb, and the communicators are all dead. It sounds to me like a frequency block. Damn it, that can't be right. Get your ass up here on the double. I want to know why we have this communications problem. "Get your ass up here on the double." I know what I'd like to do with her arse. 22... - How is he? - 31... 40. Okay, let's get his suit off, please. How is he? - What's that in his hand? - No, don't. - Get me an isolation unit. Come on. - What is it? Holly, give me half an hour, then you can talk to him. Okay. I want to know what kind of crystals these are. - I'll run some tests. - Okay. This is Xeno Sub-satellite Research Team Seven, Archaeology Team Documentation Officer conducting Interview... 273 with Commander Holly McKay. Holly, what can you disclose about this accident? We have no idea what caused the explosion. Our photographer, Ricky Williams, was there, and narrowly escaped serious injury. Dean White has yet to be located. - But does this mean we have to extend? - There's no way we can extend. If we miss the pick-up, there's no telling how long it'll be before Xeno can slot us in again. - That's all I can say for the moment. - Well, thank you. Holly? We've got Dean. Is he dead? Technically, he's still alive. Anything you can do? I've done everything I can. I'll just keep him alive until we get him back. Holly, we must get back into that tomb. That may prove unfeasible. Mitch has a theory that the planet was ruled by twins. That's right. The inscriptions indicate a very interesting belief in mythology. Now, everything seemed to happen in pairs. I've never come across anything like it. The planet has two suns. Maybe that's the reason for the duplication? You know, the creation of the previous race fascinates me. There seems to be a chemical intelligence present. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I want to know what caused that explosion first. Look, we're not gonna change our departure time, but Mitch is right. I mean, this obviously needs to be investigated. Sharon, do you have any more information about those crystals? Well, I've only just started the tests, but there seems to be some sort of... energy force surrounding the crystals. Look, this team isn't prepared for the contingencies we're facing now. If it was up to me, I'd say abandon and get taking off. But it could be years before anybody was sent back here. Perhaps never. All our work would be wasted. Listen, I'm not feeling too hot. I think I'd better get some rest. Take care of yourself, Rick. There's still the question of what caused the explosion. I think we'll leave it for someone else to find out. Unknown energy fields are beyond the range of this team. Barbra, let's tell Xeno to take us off, please. Can't for 72 hours. They're in orbit. Well, as soon as you can, then. In the meantime, I don't want anyone going near that site without my direct permission. - Mm-hmm? - Gail here. Sorry to bother you, Mark, but I'm getting an electrical disturbance coming from the lab. - Right, I'll hurry down there and check it. - Okay. - Gail? - Yes? Would you do me a favour? Er... would you ask Sandy to meet me down there? - Yes, okay. - Okay, thanks a lot. Hello. I love you. Mmm. I love you, too. What's the matter with the lights? I don't know, but I think it's kinda great. Erm... What exactly have you discovered from the inscriptions inside the tomb? I found some very disturbing elements which, at the moment, I don't fully understand. Now, the previous inhabitants were obviously highly intelligent, but there seems to be a form of, er... self-destruction... Mitch, sorry. Er, Kate... Holly wants to have some photographic evidence of the damage caused by the explosion. Well, what's that got to do with me? You and I have been assigned to do it. Yesterday, Holly said she didn't want anyone to go out there. Yep, that's more like it. We should get some evidence. Do you want to take some photographs, honey? Oh, I don't know. I'll be glad when we go home. Yes, I know what you mean. Hey, Ricky. Well, what's wrong? Hey, what are you doing? - I've got to find Dean! - Ricky, come here. - What's up with you? - Get out of my way! Ricky, it's all right. It's all right. Listen, Ricky. Listen to me, Dean's not in there. Let go. Let go! No! Stop it! See to him. Ricky! Ricky! Hey, Ricky. - Are you okay? - No, no, no, let's go. What's down there? - Where does it lead to? - I don't know but I'm gonna find out. - Will you be all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Where does it go? - The track. - I'll check the other route. - We'll get back to the monitors. Get to Operations, Barbra. Oh, no! He's left that outer door open. Well, he can't stay out there for long. Gary, do you see him? Yes, I can. He's just wandering around, as if he's lost his sense of direction. I've lost him, Holly. Ricky? Gail! Get over here, quickly! I... can't. I can't, Holly, my foot's stuck. Gary, any way to override the lock on this door? I'm not sure. I'll get Barbra to check the main computer. If Gary can get that inner door open, you could get out there, right? - That's right. - Okay. Get this off. - How long have we got? - Only two or three minutes, maybe. - Let's do it slow. Come on. That's it. - There must be a way of overriding that lock. Gail, you must get here quickly. We need to close the airlock. My thermal unit's gone. Okay, Gail? Gail. This is Gary. Now, listen to me. You must connect the blue and yellow leads. Repeat, connect the blue and yellow leads. That will bypass the thermostat. We can't get to you, Gail. You have to do it yourself. Come on, Gail. Oh, Gary... I can't do it. You've got to help me. I can't help you, Gail. You've got to help yourself. The blue and yellow leads. Oh, Christ, I'm freezing. Gary, her body temperature's dropped. Connect the leads, Gail! - Bloody gloves! - Down to 36.5. Gary, I can't do it! "Can't" is a word I don't understand. Now do it, Gail! You can't give up now. - 36.2. - Oh, Gary, I'm gonna die out here. - She'll go into hypothermia at this rate. - I can't help you, sweetheart. - It's up to you. - Help me, Gary. 35.6. 35.5. You must do it, Gail. Connect the wires. The blue and the yellow. Gail! Listen to me! She'll go unconscious any minute. Gail! No, Gail. Gail! Reconnect the life-support! Reconnect the life-support! - 34.8. - Gail! This is Gary. Listen to me, Gail. 34.7. Gail. Gail! Bypass the thermostat, woman! Damn you, woman! Kate, come here and shut the door. Oh... Kate, come over here. That's an order! Oh... Ricky, out of my way. Ricky, get out of my way. Ricky! Well, what would you have done? You didn't see him in that tomb. He was... Then I just... I... - I just freaked. - Did you have to kill him? It's very easy for you to talk here in the operations room. He was out of his mind. That outer door was open. What would've happened if he'd opened the inner one? Look, any of you could've found yourself in the same situation. What would you have done? All right, Kate. All right. Calm down. What do you make of Ricky's behaviour? Well, he was obviously exposed to something out there. What it is, I've got no idea. There is a chance it has something to do with the crystals. - Ah, so a contamination problem? - No, not necessarily. You see, the crystals have been in the station about 24 hours, but Ricky was showing symptoms long before that. No, I think whatever it is must break the skin, as in Ricky's case, or at least have some form of close physical contact. My tests don't show any organic matter. What do you think they could contain? Well, we're gonna have to get samples of that stuff, because people are gonna want to look at it. Holly, surely there's no obligation to continue with any of this? I know, Kate, but it's my job. You want to be careful with that, Mitch. Yeah. You know, there's something about these crystals that we just haven't discovered yet. Now... their energy must have something to do with a life source. Do you mean there might be something out there feeding on them? - We'll lose audio here. - Okay. Stay close, huh? Don't worry, I will. Sandy! Sandy! It's okay. It's all right. Come on. Sh-sh-ssh. Sandy, Sandy. Come on. Okay, that's enough. Come on. She's calming down. What happened out there? We shouldn't have brought him in here. - Sharon, I have to examine him. - No! Give her one of your shots, and clear her head. Sandy, do you hear me? - She's in no condition to talk. - I'll put her in condition. She needs to rest. Sandy, we have to know what's out there. Try, Sandy. - Try. - Leave her alone. She can't hear you. Listen, Sandy's in a deep trauma. No... I think she's been literally scared out of her senses. No... How do you feel? - Thirsty. - I'll get you a drink. - You got any pain? - No. Thanks. - I feel sick. - Hang on. Come on. Back we go. Get your legs up. - Sandy, I want you to take these. - Oh, I couldn't. - Does that arm hurt? - Yes. - You gave me an injection, didn't you? - Yes, I did, but in the other arm. - Let's have a look. - Ooh. Come on, Sandy, come on. It's all right. Come on, come on, back you come. There we are, it's all right. It's all right. Now listen, Sandy, we're going to give you a thorough examination, hmm? Holly? Yes, Karl? Problem? - Yes, it's Sandy. - Oh, how is she? Well, she's fine as long as I keep her sedated. But do you remember the marks I found on Ricky's hand? - Yes? - She has one on her arm. - Oh, Christ. - Yeah, and that's not all. As you know, Holly, I perform certain prescribed medical duties... - What are you getting at? - Including quarterly injections to restrict... - Are you trying to tell me she's pregnant? - Two months. That can't be. We had our injection the same time. Please! No! No! No! Jesus. Now we'll never know what happened. That's the end of our project. All right, what's Xeno's position, Barbra? We should be able to make contact in six hours. Well, then all we can do is wait. Mm... Ah... Hi. Feeling better? I tell you, I can't wait to go home. Don't know about you but I've had this mission. Don't know what's going on but whatever it is, it's weird. I agree with Kate completely. We should abandon and go home. Can't wait to go home. Go away. Go away! I said, go away! Holly, go away! Go away! - Hey, there's Sandy. - What are they up to? Sandy? Mmm... Ah! Ow. Ooh. Pay attention, please. Secure all stations. Remain just where you are. Secure all doors. Do not admit anyone. Do not admit any personnel. - Mark? - Yeah, Holly? - Mark? - What's going on? Sandy's killed Barbra. - What are you talking about? - Listen, she's killed Barbra. - I don't understand this. - No time to explain. You gotta reach Sharon right now. - Well, where's Sharon? - In her quarters, I hope. Mark, please be careful. - Who is it? - It's Mark. - What do you want? - Open the door. No. Hey, quit screwing around, Sharon, and open the door. We've all had instructions to keep our doors locked. Sharon, I'm ordering you to open this door. My instructions came from Holly. Well, get Holly on the damn communicator, then! Control? - I've got Mark outside the door, and... - Well, open it! Come on, Sharon. - Are you there? - Yeah. Hello? - Mark, you with Sharon? - Yeah, I'm here, she's here. Bring her up here now. No, no, no... - Go to the mess hall first. - What for? We may need food. Okay. - Be careful. - Yup. - What's going on? - Come on, I'll tell you later. Number three scanner's gone dead. Damn it, four's gone now. At least she's nowhere near those two. What's that? I don't know. Come on. I'll take that. Can't you fix it? I'm trying, Holly, I'm trying. Is there something wrong with the videos, Gary? You've got it. We've lost six. - Did Sandy do that? - Yes, she did. Why would she knock out the videos? I'll take care of this, Gary. That was a smart idea. Switch on emergency. Where's Kate? Kate? - She's very strong! - What weapons have you got? We've got to stop her, not hurt her, Kate. There's only one way to stop her, and that is to kill her. What do you suggest? Do you know anything about that, Kate? Explosives. You wouldn't know where to detonate. With the videos out, she could be anywhere. - Unless you were on the spot. - We could use the touch burner. - What's that? - Used for heat sealing. Burn right through her brain. - What do you suggest? - Keeping her alive! He's the doctor. Ask him how to keep her alive. - I could inject her with a drug. - Shall I hold her arm while you do it? She's pregnant, Kate. That'll look great on the report. "The team were terrorised by an expectant mother." She's blowing up the place. Transmitter's out. She's thinking fast. - What about Xeno? - We're out of contact. - Someone help me. - Sandy? She's in the exercise room. - Holly, I'm going to her. - Don't be a fool, Karl. Holly, I'm a doctor, and she's in pain. - She might have gotten hurt in that... - I'll decide who goes! Well? If I can restrain her with the burner, can you sedate her? I'll get my things. - Where's the touch burner? - Preparation chamber. - Stay here, Gary, please. - Yes, sir. What's happening to me? Help me. Someone, please. Help... please. Come on. It's all right, Sandy, it's all right. Come on. - It's all right. - Now, Sandy... Now come on, take it easy. I'm here, okay? Just relax. Give me your hand. That's it. - Now take it easy, come on. - Ssh. - That's right. Now... - It's okay. - Come on now, just relax. - Don't worry. Take it easy, that's it. - Don't worry. It's all right. - Hold her, Sharon. - Just relax, come on. - It's all right. It's not going to... No! Come here, Sandy. Come on. Come on! - You've got to keep steady, Karl. - Holly! - Out of my way! - Holly! No! No! No! Sharon! Help me! Sharon! Sharon! Sharon! No! No! Help! Watch it, Mark. Okay, come on, Sharon. Watch your leg. Put your arm around me. - Please, help me. - Are you okay? Come on. Come on. Kate? Get her to the chair. Have you seen her? - What is it? - It's her leg. Let me have a look. Where are the others? - Come on, it's all right. - Gary, I don't know. She'll be okay, it's not broken. How are we gonna stop this? Well, if we can get to the space preparation chamber, we've still got picks there. - It's no good. - Look, we've got to try something. - There are chainsaws. - She's too strong. You can't get away from me, you know. It doesn't matter what you do, you'll have to come out sometime. There's no other way. So why don't you... all just come out now? Mark? Mark. I'm waiting for you. This is our chance. For you. You needn't be like the others. What do you think? You keep her occupied, we'll get the equipment. Why don't you just... open the door? It would be so easy. Mark? Mark. I'm waiting for you. Mark? I'm waiting for you. Our best bet's the derelict passages. She won't look for us there. Mark! Mark, I'm waiting for you! Mark! Please, help me! Sandy? Sandy, can you hear me? Sandy? Mark... I need you. Sandy... I promise you, I'll help you. I promise you. Can you hear me? Oh! Kate! What was that? Mark? - No... - Kate! Quiet, woman. Sa... Sandy? - Sandy? - You can't escape me. Is that out? Sandy? - Is that off? - I don't know. Sandy? Quickly, let's get out of here. Oh! Oh! Kate! Move, woman! Ohh... - Mark? - Yeah, Gary. You all right? Where are you? Outside the airlock. What the hell are you doing out there? She chased me out. I'm okay, but I don't know how long I can stay out here. Is your air system functioning? It's fine. You worry about yourself, Harvard. - Oh, no. - Gary, what's the matter? She's... she's breathing the atmosphere. She's... she's what? Oh, no. Gary! Gary! Help me. Help me. Gary! Gary? He's here with me, Mark. Damn it! We're dead! What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? I'm going to kill her. I am going to kill her. No! - Get those lights... get the lights on! - Don't leave us. No! No! No! No! No! Mark! - Kate, what the hell are you...? - Jesus, what have you got in there? - Come on, Kate! - In there. All right, Kate, get her in here. Can you carry...? I'll get the door. Let her go... Over there. - She's gonna come looking for them. - That's right. Lock the door. Lock it, Sharon. No! Ah... Ahhh! Mark! Sharon? Sharon? 75 TX Xeno 2, this is Auxiliary Module 047. Reply, please. I receive you, 047. This is Xeno 2. Please advise your status. I have the location, and am approaching planet surface.
