- I got your car around back. Drive you home. Mr. Saroyan! - Yes? - Why didn't you answer him? - Because he's having regrets about playing the part. I can understand. He will receive angerfrom his people. - But he thinks Turkey was at war with Armenia. Doesn't it botheryou that he doesn't get the history? - No, not really. - I mean, why didn't you explain to him that we were citizens, we were Turkish citizens. We had a right to be protected. - Are you driving him home? - Yeah. - Huh. Take this. Buy him a bottle of champagne. Let him think that he has done something... special? - Something special. - L'm sorry, Mr. Saroyan, I don't think I understand. - Young man, do you know what still causes... so much pain? It's not the people we lost, orthe land. It's to know that we could be so hated. Who are these people, who could hate us so much? How can they still deny their hatred? And so hate us... hate us even more? - That was a good scene. - Thanks. - Must be really weird to get into that... head space. - Yeah. - I mean, I was raised with all these stories, you know. Evil Turks and everything, so... l'm a little hardened to it all. But what you did today, I mean, it, uh... It made me feel all that anger again. - Hey, thanks. So I take it you're, uh... Armenian. - Well, yeah. Yeah, that's what I meant when I said I was, you know, raised to feel out of hatred to... the person you're playing. - Right. Right. - You really pulled it off. - Well, it'd be kind of hard to disappoint you. - What do you mean? - Well, you were kind of prepared to hate my character... you said. - Well, sure. But l'm also kind of suspicious of stuff that's supposed to make me feel anything. You know? When I was watching it, like even though I know you were supposed to make me feel like hating you, l... I resisted it. But, uh... But then, I mean, by the end of the scene, ljust... I... - You felt like killing me. - Yeah. My dad was killed trying to assassinate a Turkish diplomat. It was almost 15 years ago. I could never understand... what would make him want to murder... what he had to imagine that Turkish ambassador represented. But today, you gave me a sense of what was going on in his head. I wanna thank you. - Well... you're welcome. - Shit. - What's this? - It's from Edward. He wanted to give it to you. And thanks. - Now, was this before or after my conversation with him? - After. I guess he wants to show there are no hard feelings. - Ah. Okay. Thanks. - Were you serious about what you told him? - What? - That you don't think it happened? - What, the genocide? - Yeah. - Are you gonna shoot me or something? Look, I never heard about any of this stuff when I was growing up. You know? I did some research forthe part. From what I read, there were deportations and... Lots of people died. Armenians and Turks. It was World War I. - But Turkey wasn't at war with the Armenians. I mean, just like Germany wasn't at war with the Jews. They were citizens. They were expecting to be protected. That scene you just shot was based on an eyewitness account. Your character, Jevdet Bey, the only reason they put him in Van was to carry out the complete elimination of the Armenian population in Van. There were telegrams, there were communiquTs. - Look, l'm not saying that something didn't happen. - Something... - Look, I was born here. So were you. Right? - Yeah. - This is a new country. So let's just drop the fucking history and get on with it. No one's gonna wreck your home. No one's gonna destroy yourfamily. Hmm? So let's go inside and uncork this thing... and celebrate. Hmm? - Do you know what Adolf Hitler told his military commanders to convince them that his plan would work? 'Who remembers the extermination of the Armenians?' - And nobody did. Nobody does. [Announcement]: For security reasons, please do not leave your bags unattended. Veuillez garder avec vous vos bagages ? main en tout temps pour des raisons de s?curit?. - Roll up your sleeves. - Why? - Please, roll up your sleeves. - I don't take drugs. - Can you open that bag, please? The numberyou gave me has been disconnected. - They must've closed the production office. - Then who's paying your bills? - What bills? - The cost of yourtravel. - L'm paying for it myself. - I thought this was forthe film. - It is. - Then why wouldn't they be paying for it? - Because... they don't know I went. They didn't want to shoot there, so I... I went myself. I found myself a cameraman and we went to shoot this material. I thought the director might need some extra shots, stuff that he could cut in later. - And what about the digital effects, the people marching? - Well, that can still be added if that's what they want to do. - Can you play one of these on this? - Yeah. - Could you put it on, please? - Kind of personal. - Then let's go somewhere private. - 'L'm here, Mum. Ani. In a dream world, the three of us would be here together. Dad, you and me. I remember all the stories I used to hear about this place. The glorious capital of our kingdom. Ancient history. Like the story that Dad was a freedom fighter- fighting for the return of this, I guess. And then he died. And now something in me died too. What am I supposed to feel when I look at these ruins? And do I believe that they're ravaged by time, or do I believe that they've been wilfully destroyed? Is this proof of what happened? Am I supposed to feel anger? Can I ever feel the anger that Dad must've felt when-' - When he tried to kill a Turkish diplomat? - How did you know? - You gave me your passport. Files are kept. You have to be the son of a... terrorist. Will you turn that back on, please? - 'He tried to kill that man. Why was he prepared to give us up for that? Mom, what's the legacy he's supposed to have given me? Why can't I take any comfort in his death? When I see these places, I realize how much we've lost. Not just the land and the lives, but the loss of any way to remember it. There is nothing here to prove that anything ever happened. [Turkish] - Excuse me, please don't get too close to the paintings. - I like looking at the details. Do you know anything about this artist? - Not really. I mean, I picked up a little from that lecture the other night. The one you left. - What do you remember from the lecture? - How much he suffered, losing his family. His mother dying of starvation in his arms. - When you look at this painting, can you understand? - Understand what? - That he would kill himself. His home was lost, his family destroyed, neverto be seen again. This painting shows his pain. So much pain. He couldn't stand it. [Armenian music playing] - What do you think? - I haven't finished it. - What you've read so far. - Rouben... l'm not the best judge forthis kind of thing. L've never read a script before. - Did you get to the part where Gorky rushes into the street and grabs the rifle from the wounded Turk? - Yes. - I know Edward's style is a bit overthe top, but... - It's really... It's very... good. Listen... maybe l'II get more excited when I actually see it. It's... it's difficult for me to... imagine these things Go retrieve the rifle! Run! Run! As a boy involved in the heroic defence of van, Gorky was witness to one of the most courageous moments in Armenian history. But the years which were to follow would see him lose a home, his people, and most dramatically, his beloved mother. In his most famous painting, Gorky leaves his mother's hand unfinished. As if the history of its composition, like that of his people, had been violently interrupted. The earthly sensuality of the mother's touch is no more. Only pure, burning spiritual light remains. - Excuse me. You said before that Gorky worked on that painting 10 years. - That's right. - Is it possible to work on something that long and leave it unfinished? - The painting is finished. The unfinished hands of his mother were left purposely that way. - Yeah, but... don't you think he finished his mother's hands and after, decided to erase them? That he needed to destroy what he made? Can we talk about his suicide? - No. - Why not? - Because it was not what I had intended to read today. - L'm just curious about the way you described the suicide in your book. You... you make it sound as if Gorky was obsessed with memories of the genocide, but you don't talk about... ...coming to this event. - Okay, okay. Ljust want to talk about the suicide. What's yourfucking problem? - You... you said something to my father. Like what? - That you were having an affair. Don't get involved in things that don't concern you. Did you intend to destroy his life? What are you talking about? My father left my motherforyou... my father gave up everything foryou. I have nothing to apologize for. My father loved you. My father was suffering, if he knew that you were having an affair... I have no doubt that he would have killed himself. Yourfather died accidentally. He tripped, and fell. I don't have any other way of explaining it. It's a question of time. There's no rush to separate... Listen, I didn't see him fall. You didn't see him fall, oryou don't want to think you saw him fall. I don't remember anything but the fact that he slipped and he fell. I can't remember it the way you want me to. And even if I could remember what you want me to remember... ...I wont. I don't need to. Do you understand? - Hey! Hey, no! Let go. Let go. - She was carrying a knife. - Yes. - So there was a certain degree of premeditation? - It was a pocketknife, something she always carries. - Because she never knew when she might need it. - What do you mean? - L'm talking about her job, what she did for a living! Oh, yes, I know all sorts of things. When she was arrested, the police discovered she'd dealt drugs, as well as various credit frauds on the Net. You were questioned about your involvement; she insisted you had nothing to do with it. It's all on yourfiles. Was that true? - What? - That you had nothing to do with it? - L... I knew about it. - Well, you didn't tell anyone? - No. - So you didn't have a problem with the fact that your sister was dealing in drugs? - Step-sister. - Ah, yes, step-sister. Most people are... obvious about the crimes they commit. By the time I get them to this room, it's just a matter of time before... it all comes out. - What? - Their shit. - I don't understand. - My job becomes pretty simple, really. I sit where you are, I watch them on this toilet, waiting forthe truth, the compressed tablets of heroin. Sometimes they get so nervous, the body acid breaks the package and they overdose. But that can take hours. I sit and wait. It's usually pretty silent. They have time to think. So do I. You know what goes through my mind, Raffi? I wonder if I should feel sorry forthem. They're usually kids around your age; l'm about to destroy their lives. I know they're sorry for what they've done and they'II never go through it again. But the action has been taken. It's too late. - I had to go there. - I have no doubt about that. Aflame was lit in your heart. You thought things would be clarified by... going there. They weren't. You lost meaning. And people are vulnerable when they... Iose meaning. They do stupid things. - I didn't lose meaning. It's more like the meaning of things changed. - What are you doing? - There's something I need to read to you. - Ani, you're being ridiculous. Her attacking the painting had nothing to do with this film. - I won't go on with this. - You need to. We all do. - What does this mean to you? - L'm sickened by it. - Because you feel responsible? - No, of course not. L'm sickened because people shouldn't do those things. - What, attack works of art? - What's your point, Ani? - Rouben, you're sickened because that painting is a repository of our history. It's a sacred code, that explains who we are and how and why we got here. - Excuse me, you can't cross set. We're rolling. We have an intruder on set. - Okay. We'II handle it from here. - Oh, clamp, clamp. - What is she doing? - Oh, look at this. - It took us hours to set this up. - I need to talk to you. - Better be paying me for overtime. - Please, we're shooting a scene. - All right, no. We're cutting. - What is this? Godammit! We're surrounded by Turks. We've run out of supplies. Most of us will die. The crowd needs a miracle. This child is bleeding to death. If I can save his life, it may give us the spirit to continue. This is his brother. His pregnant sister... was raped in front of his eyes, before her stomach was slashed open to stab her unborn child. His father's eyes were gouged out of his head and stuffed into his mouth. And his mother's breasts were ripped off. She was left to bleed to death. Who the fuck are you? '-In a field of cinders, where Armenian life was dying, a German woman, trying not to cry, told me the horrors she'd witnessed. I must tell you what I saw so people will understand the crimes that men do to men.' It was Sunday morning, the first useless Sunday dawning on the corpses. I saw a dark crowd in the courtyard lashing a group of young women. And animal of a man shouted, 'You must dance, dance when the drum beats. With fury, the whips cracked on the flesh of the women. Hand in hand, the brides began their circle dance. Dance, they raved. Dance till you die.' '...dance with bare breasts, without shame...' [cracking whips and shouting] Then, someone brought a jug of kerosene. 'The brides were anointed. 'Dance,' they thundered. There is a fragrance sweeter than any perfume. With a torch, they set the brides on fire. And the charred bodies rolled to their deaths. The German woman looked at me and said: 'How shall I dig out these eyes of mine?' Tell me. How?' [Screaming] This is it, Mom. The Madonna and child, on the island of Aghtamar, where it all began. I was there when they shot that scene. It was the same day she attacked the painting. The painting based on this. I left for Turkey a week later. - Does she know you went to the island? - Who? - Your mother. - No. No, she doesn't. - Have you spoken to her? - No. - People lose touch. - There's something l've been meaning to ask you. - Yeah? - Aren't there dogs used forthis sort of thing? - What sort of thing? - Well, if you think there are drugs in these cans... - Yeah, we have dogs forthat. - So, uh... why don't you use one? - What? - A dog. - A dog would take away what I like most about this job. - What's that? - The opportunity to... better understand how the mind works. A dog would come in and bark. And that bark would mean only one thing: That there were drugs in these cans. Ruff! You're lying. I caught you. You're a liar. That's what a dog does. - Right. - L'm not saying that what a dog does isn't important. But there are... other issues involved. Aren't there? Things a dog doesn't have the capacity to consider. A dog... wouldn't know he's being retired, that this is his last day, his final interrogation. Is someone picking you up? - No. - Good. Might be worried. Even l'm worried. - About what? - About you. What are we gonna do? There's no one I can contact. There's no way of confirming... that a single word that you've told me tonight is true. - Everything l've told you is exactly what happened. - My mother never told me about what happened during the march. Only one story. They had a pomegranate tree in the garden. And when they came to take the family away, she grabbed one of the fruit. She knew the journey would be long. Every day, she would take out one seed and eat it. She would bite it bit by bit, pretending that one seed was a whole meal. Try it. Now, when I eat a pomegranate seed, it gives me two things: Luck and a powerto imagine. [Beeping] - Hello? - Mom. Hi. - Raffi? Raffi, where are you? - Ljust got back to Toronto. They've stopped me here at Customs, with all the footage I got forthe film. They're wondering what's inside the cans. - What cans? What are you talking about? - The stuff I had to shoot around Van. They've stopped me here at Customs and, uh... they want to open the cans, but they can't. Because... Raffi, do you want me to lie? - Yes. I miss you too. I have so much to tell you, Mom. I went to Aghtamar. - Aghtamar? - I found the mother and child on the church. I had some days free, so I went to Aghtamar. Here, l'm gonna hand you overto the inspector. I think he wants to know more about the film this is for. - Hello. Are you Raffi's mother? - Yes, I am. - Are you a professor at the university? - Yes, that's right. - And you're involved in this film? - Yes, I was hired as a historical consultant. A book I wrote was used as a reference. - What was the book about? - It was about the life of Arshile Gorky. - Is he the main character in the film? - No. - What was your son shooting in Turkey? - He had to go to the place where Arshile Gorky was born. - Why? - To shoot some material. - And how is this material to be used? - To help show what happened. - How did he die? - Who? - Gorky. - Why are you asking me these questions? - Did he kill himself? [Cheering and clapping] - Ani, we have to go. - Where are you? - Where am I? - Listen, she's at the premiere of the film, and she'II have to get back to you, okay? - Hello? May I speak to my son, please? - So the film is completely finished. - Please, let me speak to my son. Raffi? - Yeah. Tell me what to do. - Sure. L'II meet you at home. - Marty, how are you responding to the people who say this is all an exaggeration? - It's, you know... it's documented. And really, every word I say is directly quoted from Ussher's own journal. - Marty! - That's where I met them, right on the train. - To Ararat. - Yeah. They were shooting a commercial. - A commercial? - I became friends with the cameraman and I told him that I wanted to get an image with this. This. I wanted to get a shot of Ararat in the picture. - What for? - Forthe film. I thought it was something we could use. - How? The film is finished. - I wasn't thinking about that. He had to bribe a soldier to take us up. That's a military road, okay? You can't just go up there. That's his voice. You can actually hear it on the... We went up about halfway and then... We shot this footage from there. On film. On this film. - Why didn't you tell me this before? - I had to tell you the other story. - Why? - Because it meant something to me. - So this voice on the tape, this crew person, gave you the film, let you use his camera, bribed a soldier... and then drove you up Mount Ararat. - Yes. - Did he ask you to do him a favour in return? - Who? - Raffi... Did he ask you to bring anything into this country? - He asked me to bring those cans. - And what's in them? - He said it's film. - Why did you believe him? - Ani. Ani! [Screaming] - Close the door. - Can we turn out the light? - Why? - So the film won't be ruined. - You're still convinced. - You can feel it in the dark. - All right, Raffi. Turn out the light. Forthe last time, what do you think is in here? - Film. That's what he told me. That's what I need to believe. - And what would happen if you didn't believe it? - L'd be a criminal. - And what would you say if I told you it was heroin? - It isn't. - What makes you so sure? - You'd turn the light on. - Sir? The arrivals? The international arrivals? - You let him go? - Yep. - But what was in the cans? - Would you believe me if I told you? - What do you mean? - Heroin. - No. - Film? - But I don't get it. You did check the cans. - Yeah. One. - What was in it? - Ah, it doesn't matter, for Chrissake. - Dad! - I trusted him. - But he was lying to you all night. He... He changed his story. - The more he told, the closer he came to the truth. Till he finally told it. I couldn't punish him for being honest. - But he was smuggling drugs. - He didn't think he was. - How do you know? - He didn't believe he could do something like that. - Dad... what came overyou? - You did, Philip. I was thinking of you. - How are you responding to the people who say this is all an exaggeration? - This film is the kind of film- - You have a visitor. ...you can do only once in your lifetime. Because it tells a story which is a true story... - Arshile Gorky was born in a small village on the shores of Lake Van. From the shores of this village, the island of Aghtamar was in plain view. Gorky, as a child, would go to this island with his mother, who would show him the detailed carvings on the walls of the church. - Why are you showing this to me? - This is the origin, from the memory of this place, right to the photograph, to the sketch, to the painting. You told me to go there. I had to put something in my heart. If that was gonna happen, it was gonna happen here. That I was prepared to throw my whole life away. And last night, as we were sitting in that... dark room, as I heard him open the can, I felt it. - You felt what? His ghost. The ghost of my father.
