They really pinned it to you this time, didn't they? - This way, please. - [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] [ SIren Continues ] [ Toilet Flushes ] "Doyle,James R." [ Speaking French ] MercI. Uh, "42 years old. Nickname, Popeye." Cute. Spinach. What are you doing with my file in the shit house, huh? This another one ofyour, uh, April Fool jokes? No. I like reading it here. Uh, 60 kilos of heroin. It was a big arrest. Myyoung Miletto, we have an authentic American hero here. [ Chuckles ] Where the fuck did you get that? Mr. Doyle, I was requested to help you. I didn't request that you come here... but naturally, I wanted to know who you were. I found out. After this big arrest, it disappeared. I read in the papers that somebody stole your heroin... right out of police headquarters. Was it your friends? - [ Water Running ] - My friends are still on the force. How many men have you killed? Hey, wait a fucking minute. Wait a minute! Am I being interrogated here? Am I working with you or am I some kind of goddamn suspect or what? Five. Five people killed. It seems quite a lot. I've been a New York cop for14 years. I know that the dope that comes out ofthis city has killed a lot more than I have. Two ofthe dead were policemen. Right? Miletto, show him his office. Mr. Doyle, this is, uh... your office right here. - Yeah. - [ Toilet Flushing ] Right next to the, uh— the shit house, huh? You got a telephone, an extension. It's terrific. Really nice. Hey, Henry, it's beautiful. Really beautiful. Yeah, I'd be better off in New York on welfare. Hey, poor Popeye. You are, how do you say, homesick. I sent for some spinach. Hey, Barthelemy. Why don't you knock off the chicken shit, huh? Look, I'd rather be a lamppost in New York than the president of France... but I came over here for one thing and one thing only- to get Charnier. And that's what I'm gonna do. ¤'m gonna get him and put him where he belongs, even ifyou won't. Hey, bravo. It's D-day in Marseilles. The Americans have landed. - [ Speaking French ] - [ Buzzes ] [ Speaking French ] Hey, this Charnier ofyours, to begin with, this is certainly not his name. Second, there is no record ofsuch a man... here, in Paris or in the streets. But there is more ofa record on you, and it's not very nice. I must remind you it's you that let him escape. Come. Back to work. But you come only with us to observe, huh? You carry no gun, I hope. You know, it's illegal for foreigners, even policemen. No. No gun. I'm strictly by the book. You read my file, right? That's why I asked. [ Shutter Clicks ] [ Chattering ] - [ Speaking French ] - [ Man On Radio ] Oui Henri. Oui. Okay. Doyle. You just stay close to me and observe. You are my guest. You do nothing, say nothing, okay? Who, me? I'm naked, remember? You must think I'm some sort of hero or something. No, no. I'm just here to watch how the pros do it. - Yeah.

No. Ifyou'd done what I told you, he would still be alive. [ Speaking French ] Hey, what did he say? What did he say? Look at all this stuff. Must have been acid, huh? Look at that acid.

That's not part of my plan to sit around beating my meat... while you French narcs grab all the credit. That's what you want, right? You stick me next to the shit house... while you pull down all the medals, right? That's right. - [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Tires Screeching ] [ Siren Fading In Distance ] [ Dog Barks In Distance ] [ Speaking French ] We should decide the matter ofthe rendezvous... a place to meet afteryou have made the delivery. - How's New York? - [ Chuckles ] You know better than that, William. New York is hazardous to your health, at least to my health. But it is an amusing city. [ Speaking French ] How did you do it, if it's not a secret? Oh, it was very simple and very droll. Eighty-three policemen wanted to talk to me. And 52 ofthem chose to talk to my money instead. I love a city where you always know where you stand. [ Whistles ] Hey, Hank.

Well, I have two men on Doyle day and night... but he is, uh, uh, unpredictable. No. I would not do it this way. First, l would tell Doyle myself that he's being used as, uh... how do you say, uh, as bait. Well, he's your man, not mine, Inspector. Oh, yes. He's very evident. Very visible. Yes. Hello? Hello?

I wanted to find out, uh, why Charnier likes this burg so much, you know. - I think I found out. - Found out what? I found out that while Charnier is kind ofwalking around free... the police are inside having two-hour lunches. Can I get you a taxi to the airport? - No, I don't think so. I think I'll just stay here. - As you wish. Yeah, well, listen. I want you to do me a favor. Get your two tails off my back, will you? What, is the tall one your brother-in-law? Is that it? - Listen, Doyle— - No, you listen! I came over to get that fucking Charnier, and I'm gonna get his ass. And I could do a lot better ifSacco and Vanzetti were off my tail, understand? You gotta put them back on the school crossing where they belong. They might get run over by a bicycle. I don't want that on my conscience. Nice to have met you. [ Speaking French ] You want this ball? Huh? Come on. Come on. Come over and get it. God, I wish this Blanc de Blancs would travel. I'd like to take 20 cases with me back to Washington. All you Americans have that misconception. Wine will travel. It is people who have difficulty. [ Both Chuckling ] By the way, they understood about you not traveling with the shipment. Good. I'm pleased you all continue to see the situation as I do. Bill. Has Geneva taken the necessary first step? Exactly as you wanted it... with a good spread against inflation and floating currencies- 100,000 South African rands, 50 in Canadian dollars, another 50 in Yen. 200,000 all together. Ten percent as per the agreement. Okay. Tell them the final shipment is en route. - Once it arrives, we cook for a few days. - Understood. We are expecting you for dinner. A little party.

Sacco and Van— [ Speaking French ] I must say, Mr. Doyle... that you were the one person I did not want to see again. - [ Speaking French ] - [ Speaking French ] My associates here... want to discuss things with you, Doyle, but in their fashion. I told them it would be useless. You would die first. And, ofcourse, then we would never find out... what you have learned about our little business. That was the expensive lesson of New York. You're a good cop. Honest. Quite stupid. But honest. Up your ass, Charnier. I'll tell you what I found out.
