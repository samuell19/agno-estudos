- Megan, is your suitcase packed yet? Put it by the front door. - Daddy's late, he was suppose to be here last night. - Remember I told you all about it. He got delayed in San Francisco, honey. - You said I could do it by myself. - Yes, but you're not doing it. - I'm taking Rosie to show grandma. I promised her I would. - But there's not room, you can carry her. - But I'm carrying Mr.Muggle and Chips, and my arms aren't big enough, see. - Well neither is the suitcase. Tell you what, why don't you take one friend, let the other two stay and keep each other company. Now run, put this by the front door for me. - Daddy's home! Daddy! - Hi sweetie, oh boy did I miss you. - Can we go now daddy, I've been waiting all day. - All right, run and get your suitcase, I just want to take a quick shower. - Well there's not time for you to take a shower, we're suppose to check in at least an hour before the flight leaves. - That's just so you can be early for the two hour delay. - It's a holiday weekend, if we're late they're gonna give our seats away. - The trip was lousy, thanks for asking. A two minute shower isn't too much to ask, is it Kim? - You gotta come with me to the Mardi Gras, I'll show you the things that tourists never see. I'm a hometown boy. - Mm, I hear more Big Apple in your voice, and Big Easy. - So I'm a world traveler. - Oh, here's the captain. You flown with her since she's made left chair? - No. Captain Mitchell. - Hi Ron. - Hi. - Barbara. Guess we're an hour late, huh? - Must be fog in San Fran. So how's your boy? - Ticked off that I'm missing Thanksgiving. - Yeah, mine too. - Look, I got a few calls to make, I'll a, I'll see you aboard, huh? - Yeah. - Seems a little cool in here. - Well he set the thermostat. - Did your promotion split you two up? - Not that we were meant to be, but I don't think it helped Showboat's ego much. - Well, it'll be a little awkward up there between you two. - That's up to him, I have no problem at all being captain. - Good, you sleep tight now, I'll be there when you wake up in the morning. Hm? Uh, okay put her on. Yeah, yeah I told you I'd be there by 2:00 o'clock, Beth. Fine, if I'm not you go to Gary's parents for the day. Why do you always have to break my back every time we talk? You walked out on me remember? Beth? - Oh. - I'm sorry folks, I didn't see you. - If you'd broken that toy my granddaughter would come hunting you. - Oh, he's harmless, I assure you. - Oh! - You all right? Did you take your pills? - Yes, and yes, stop fussin' over me. - You can sit on my lap if you need to. - Oh I'm fine, really. - Glad to hear it. My lap's the only one she's sat on in 40 years. - At least let me help with the packages. Uh, here, here pile 'em on, I'll walk with you. - Well that is a nice thing, yes sir it is. - This is silly, I was just a little dizzy, that's all. - Put that down, this nice fella might decide not to pack mule for me, and I could use the help. - My name's Ben, Ben Horner. - Wade Kale, and my wife, Helen. - Hi. - Where you headed? - Dallas. - Oh, what airline? - TAA, are we on the same flight? - I hope so, you can carry this stuff all the way to the gate. - Wade. - Everywhere you look, somebody's got his hand out. And I always tell 'em I already contributed. I fought in 'Nam, so they could have their beggin' rights. You ready for another one? I require sufficient lubrication before I fly. That's pretty funny, huh? All the combat I've seen and I'm afraid of planes. Nice talking to you, hope you crash. Give me a another one. - What's the weather look like? - Oh it's reporting light turbulence over the foot of the Rockies, nothin' serious. So, here we are, together again. Had to happen sooner or later, huh Ronnie? Or uh, should it be Captain Mitchell? - You call the other pilots by their first names on the flight deck? - Okay captain, loud and clear. - Let's run pre-flight. - It's the fastest laptop on the market. Hundred megahertz, active matrix, 10 1/2 inch screen. Makes desktops obsolete. - This is ridiculous, there's got to be a faster way to do this. - Just got this for new animated show, do you like it? It's a little weird but, it's not for kids, it's not a cartoon it's like an animated drama. - That's fascinating, can we move it along? I got a flight to catch here. - Come on. - Don't the feds have their own planes for this kind of thing? - Not for one prisoner. You know who that is? - No. - Peter Cronin, he kidnapped Russell Teague's daughter. - Oh sure, good lord, they killed that girl in cold blood. - That's why he's doing life in Leavenworth. They never caught the rest of 'em. - We're not gonna make it. - Always looking on the bright side, aren't you, Kim? - My shoe, my shoe's coming off. - Here we go, here we go, put your little dolly up there and give her a ride. - Hurry up, honey. - What, did I do it on purpose? - Sir, is everything all right? - Yes, thank you. - Hey come on, just one quick one. It'll just be our little secret. - Sorry sir, we all have to play by the same rules. - Hey come on, you keep us sitting here on the runway for half an hour and you don't even give us a drink. I'm a nervous flier help me out here. - Sorry, you'll just have to wait. - You might try prayer, some think it's all that keeps these birds aloft. - Yeah, right. - Excuse me miss, do you have any pillows? - Here we are folks. And you're right over here. - I'm not sitting with you? - Uh, honey, you sit here next to mommy, and I'll take that seat. - That's okay, I'll swap with you, that way you can be next to your folks. - Thanks. - Thank you very much, that's very sweet. - No problem. - My name's Megan, and this is my best friend Rosie. - It's nice to meet you, my name's Shayna. - This is going to be fun. I think mom and dad need some alone time together, they're cranky. - Excuse me, could you take one of us together, please? - Sure. - Thanks. - Excuse me, ma'am. Say cheeseburgers. There you go. - Oh, look at. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Mitchell. The crew and I would like to welcome you aboard TAA flight 285 to Dallas, continuing on to New Orleans. We're second up for takeoff, so settle back and enjoy your flight. Attendants, prepare for departure. - That's it, there's a broad flying the plane. Now I really need a drink. - Put your seat back up all the way please, thank you. Sorry sir, you'll have to stow that until we're in the air. - It's no problem. - Well you might actually have to talk to me, for five minutes. - Okay Kim, what did I do wrong now, or do I have to guess? Are you still upset that I stayed over in San Francisco? I told you it couldn't be helped. - That's all right we'll have another anniversary, next year. - I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you, I promise. - What can I get you two? - Well we oughta have champagne don't you think? We just celebrated our 40th anniversary. - Well, that's quite a milestone. - Not too far from a headstone, you better hurry up. - Oh, Wade, he's terrible isn't he? We'll both have soda, something without caffeine. - Darn doctors take all the fun out of gettin' old. - Can I get you ladies something to drink? - A Virgin Mary, please. - I read about her in the Bible. They named a drink after her? - Helen, how you doin'? - Never better. - You go to hell for lyin' same as for stealin' ole girl. She's got problems with her pump. How 'bout you, how'd you end up in that chair? - Honestly, I can't take you anywhere. - Vietnam, I was a medic, did a tour and a half. Thought I got special dispensation for not shooting back, wrong. - Oh, how terrible for you. Do you have a family, Ben? - That's uh, that's Julianne, she's six. - Oh, she's a doll. - Six, huh , so I guess you can still, ah, I wasn't gonna say it. - Her mother and I are divorced. They live in Dallas now, I'm in Phoenix. So uh, it's not always easy. - Would he like anything? - He's handcuffed, not deaf. I suppose a Scotch rocks is out of the question? - Nothing, thanks. - Killjoy, huh? - Quiet. - Excuse me, it's kind of a tight fit. - Too tight, I think you'll have to go around. - Why don't you just unlock these okay, before she kills you, okay. Sh, come on, come on. - Oh Cambridge, don't look so shocked. Why don't you just lean forward, I'll get this real quick, okay? Gotta be another in here somewhere, oh here, okay. - Bastard. - Did you see what he called me, huh? Rich, Rich don't create more trouble than you're worth. Huh, hey. I'm gonna need that too, here you go. - Buckle up. - Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention, okay? Pay attention, please! Now this is a hijacking. Right, right. Quiet down. Quiet! - Shh, sh, sh. Andrew would you please stand up? Stand up, Andrew. - Nice to see you out and about again. - Likewise, my friend, come on up front, okay. Let's show everybody what you got today, come on. Come here, come here. Now my friend's computer here is filled with plastic explosives. Quite enough to reduce all of us, and this plane, to tiny pieces. I hope that won't be necessary. - Altimeter setting 29.95. - Automatic indicators engaged. - They've got these aircraft so automated it's more like playing a video game than flying. - Well I'd hate to have to land this bird on a carrier deck. - Well I got shipped out too soon I never got to fly off the carriers. - Don't know what you missed. - TAA 285, heavy Dallas control I'm pinging a line of weather east of Dallas, heavy turb and precip. You might find it a little smoother up over 30, but it is a deep front, there's no traffic in your area, you are clear to ascend, over. - Okay, thank you. Looks like this video game might get interactive on us. - Um-hm. Captain. - Yes. - It's me. - Okay, Barbara, wanna open up for her. - I'm sorry, but-- - Shut up, sit down, sit down, sit down. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, let's all stay calm. Calm. My name is Peter Cronin, and I'll be your host for the rest of this flight. Wait a minute, our lady of the airways, poster girl for affirmative action. You know I was just being guarded by a female marshal. I hope you're better your job than she is at hers. Shayna up front, please. Ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder. Any would-be hero should know that my friends bomb is rigged with a pressure detonator. It's kind of technical folks but basically it means if uh, something goes wrong and someone tries to jump him, the bomb will go off. Thank you. Keep an eye on our crew for me, okay? I need to call an old friend. Women, they seem to be taking over don't they? She wouldn't hesitate to use that gun. Matter of fact, I think she's looking forward to it. Give me a credit card. I left jail without mine. - You got a lot of innocent people on this plane. - That's a profound observation, I hope the authorities appreciate that. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - I, I'm sorry can you speak up? - Frank Leyton, please. - Yeah, just one second. Dad it's for you. Must be on a car phone or something, I can barely here 'em. - Thanks. - Don't stay on the phone too long 'cause Billy's gonna call. - Give me that. Frank Leyton. - Listen carefully, Frank, is this Frank Leyton? - Yeah uh, speak up will you, this is Frank Leyton, who's this? - Frank, have you forgotten my voice already? Has it been that long, huh? - Cronin. - Very good Frank. - Dad, what's up? - Are you there, Frank? - I'm kind of surprised they let you out of your cell to make personal calls. - I'm not in my cell Frank, I'm calling from the friendly skies. - Look Cronin if this is some kind of a joke-- - Just shut up Frank, okay? I am giving the orders now. I'm in control of this airplane. Did you think it was over between us, Frank, huh? Think again. - You hijacked a plane. - Ah, he gets it, slow but sure. - You trying to get out of the country? - Not yet, I have one stop to make. Dallas, you know, the plum you got for taking me down. Your new hometown, Frank. Listen Frank, I should be on the ground in about two hours, I think that should give you plenty of time to assemble the old team. You know who I mean, don't you? - She's still in Houston. - Well you just make sure she's in Dallas when we get there. Don't forget the last time you played this game, Frank. You cost a girl her life. - Listen to me you disgusting little-- - I'll be in touch. - TAA 285 heavy, we've just got an inquiry from the Dallas FBI regarding a possible hijack of your aircraft can you deny, over? - Go ahead, tell him. - Dallas 285 heavy, affirmative on that 7-5-0-0. - I'll let Peter know it's official. - Hey sweetheart it's gonna be okay. It sure is, mommy and daddy aren't gonna let anything happen to you, okay? That's good. - Come here, you can sit with me. - Hey! Sit down! - My daughter is scared to death and I just wanna hold her. - Do you know what I want, I want you just sit down or I'm gonna kill you okay? And I think that would scare her a lot more. - I just wanna hold my child, what harm can that do? - I'm gonna count to five, okay-- - Honey, honey, sit down, she's gonna be okay. - Here's one. - Aren't you Megan, honey? - Two. - Don't hurt him, don't hurt my daddy! - Three. - Sit down! - Sit down, dude, four. - It's okay, it's okay. She's just a child, she's frightened, why can't she just sit in her dad's lap? - Look, I'm giving the orders here, okay? Do you have a problem with that? - No I just thought that it would be a lot-- - Don't question, don't argue, I don't care what you thought, okay. Did you forget that? Huh? - No. - Good. - Perfect, perfect, Ryan. Up. Okay, okay, Sakra, you need to hold on the landing, and then lift your arms when we do the flip. That was good. Okay, let's keep going, great. Jerry you have to cover for me. - Hello. This is Frank Leyton in Dallas, Deni, I got a situation here. I talked to your SAC, he's got a plane standing by to bring you here. - Don't you have a hostage negotiator in your office, Frank? - We'll talk about it when you get here. - Why would those idiots bring a criminal aboard a commercial plane? If I live through this I'm gonna sue the damn government not just the airline. - You're not helping the situation any so why don't you just shut up. - Hey why don't you just come back here and make me big mouth? - You've got more mouth than you need, mister. Shut it. - All threats to break him out of jail, the car bomb, it was all just smoke. - Come on Mag, nobody's that smart or that lucky. Someone fed him information. Sure he forced the transfer, but somebody gave him the flight information. - We get out of this, I get to find that to somebody and rip his heart out. - Or hers. - There are three of them that I know of. There may be more up at first class. - Sh, what are you doing, they will see you. - Well I can't just sit here. - Honey, don't give 'em a reason to kill you. - Look, the longer we sit here, the more panicked we're gonna get unless we do something. - You heard him, the bomb will go off. - We're gonna be on the ground for a while. If we can get this tape to the authorities it'll give 'em a clearer picture of what's going on in here. - What's the plan, we drop it in the mail? - I don't know, I don't have all the answers, all right. We gotta try. Look, you're good with people, talk to them. See if you can get 'em to communicate with you, loosen up, maybe they'll tell you something. - Come on, this is crazy. - No, crazy is sittin' here feeling weak and helpless and waiting to die. Cronin called the woman Shayna. - Look I appreciate your position captain but you understand me, this is a federal offense, I'm in command here. I want this entire airport locked down tight. - This is a busiest travel day of the year, you'll paralyze air travel, you'll have a-- - I want a media blackout. The last thing we need around here is a feeding frenzy. - All right. - All right. - And if they take us to Cuba I can at least get a good box of cigars. - Read the papers, Showboat, the French have had great results storming hijacked airplanes, so have the Japanese. Once we're down we may not get back up. - And if they do storm the plane, Cronin'll blow us to bits you know, what's he got to lose? - TAA 285 heavy, Dallas control, how you holdin' up? - Still have both wings in the air. - Roger we're getting reports of hail and heavy turb and some wind shear. Be advised, we're grounding all flights and inbound traffic is being diverted. - Not this flight. We're goin' to Dallas. - Roger that, Dallas control. Look, if they wanna divert us we should do it. It's getting nasty out there, we're heading into some nasty weather, it's gonna be dicey. - That's why we got seatbelts. Dallas, give me Frank Leyton. - Roger, flight 285, standby. - Yeah, this is Leyton. When do you tell us what you want? - I don't want to talk to you Frank, just Deni. She there yet? - Any minute. - I trust that you're not lying. If this plane lands and she's not there, the game is over. - Deni, rough flight? - So it's Cronin again? - Yep, your old buddy. Come on in this way. That's the only reason you're here, he demanded you. - Peter. - It's nice to hear your voice again, Deni. I missed you. - I'd be lying if I didn't admit I think about you every so often, Peter. - Yeah, in your dreams I bet, huh? So here we are again, the three of us. Remember last time Frank cost us a hostage. - Just tell us what you want Cronin. - You see that, he's rushing us already. Let's see, last time uh, I had one hostage and I wanted $5 million. This time let's see we got, whup, over 200 hostages that should be worth uh, 20 million in bearer bonds. Don't blow it this time. - How long till we can get the bonds? - I'll need some time, he's due to land in half an hour. You're gonna have to keep him talking. - We are gonna negotiate, aren't we Frank? I saw a lot of SWAT guys out there. - I'll order the bonds, you let him know. - Let's strap in, it's gonna get rough up ahead. - Doesn't look that bad. - You never know. Just do it. - That's mine, hey, hey. - Pull up. Pull it up! To hell with Cronin, you're gonna kill us all. Have you gone crazy? Ronnie will you tell me what the hell you're trying to do? - If Cronin thinks we're in trouble and we have to crash land, he'll let the emergency trucks out on the field. They could get in a lot closer to us with a lot more manpower. You better cinch your belt a little tighter. - Tighter? - Right now. - Hello? - What the hell's she doing? The wings'll tear off that plane. TAA 285 heavy, this is Dallas control, do you have an emergency? Repeat, do you have an emergency, over? - He's gotta be kidding. - We're up to red line Ronnie, pull it up. Pull it up! - Here we go, come on baby, get your nose up. Come on, get it up! - Get the first aid kits. - I was medic can I help? - Yes, we-- - Sit down! Everybody sit down! - What the hell's goin' on here? - This air plane's in trouble. Was anyone hurt? - Look, just do your job, okay? How long till we land in Dallas? - Our hydraulics are hurting, look at the pressure loss I'm reading three ambers, loss of fluid in system A. - I asked how long till we land in Dallas. - We'll be on the ground in 15 minutes. But this bird's wounded, we're talkin' more a controlled crash than a landing. Let's check for flap damage, shall we? - TAA 285 heavy, this is Dallas control. Please confirm your status, do you have an emergency, over? - Hey, does a hijacking qualify, you idiot? Tell Frank Leyton I want a fuel truck standing by, and the bonds better be there! - Go to your seat, right now or I kill you. - Then do it, I'm gonna help these people. - Uh. - Do you mind if I check on my daughter, please. - Be quiet. - Go ahead. - Thank you, you've been so kind to Megan. Do you have any children? - No, I had a sister a couple of years younger, she died when I was 10. - I'm so sorry. - Get away from him! - He's just trying to help her, that's all. Just, so many people are hurt-- - You sit down, right now, don't make me kill you. - What we're looking for is a way into that aircraft that will result in acceptable casualties. I'll have agents in the fuel truck that can access the main hatches. They lob in a couple of flash bangs, we use the diversion for full deployment. - But there'll be nothing left to deploy on. He's not bluffing Frank you of all people should know it. - Listen to me, storming may be the best shot we've got of gettin' anyone off that plane alive. And if Cronin thinks we're jerking him around with negotiations he's likely to blow anyway. - Storm it and he blows it up end of discussion. - We've gotta talk to him. I can get a sense of where his head's at, if there's any room with him. - Let her get him talking, think we're playing along and then my people move in. - No, you rush that plane and we lose them all. Frank, Cronin is no martyr. He wants money, that means he wants to live, don't you get that? - He's facing life without parole, he's got nothin' to lose. - But, if I can keep him talking, show him that we're cooperating. - He's not bluffing right, you said that. Well the longer the plane sits there, the higher the probability that he flips out and blows it up. - A lightning strike is your best option here. - Frank, this can't be about revenge. Are you really willing to risk all those people's lives to make Cronin pay for what went down in Phoenix? - Deni, you are out of line here. - Oh, am I? - Yes you are. - Isn't that what this is about? The same game, the same players, but a different winner. - Yeah but it's his game, not mine. - Is it? - Yeah. I'm not ruling out a raid, but it's premature. We don't know what we're dealing with yet, we don't know how many hijackers there are. - It's your call of course, but I can only reiterate-- - No need, I'm aware of your position. - Help, help please, somebody, please. I can't get the damn vial open. - Here, give it to me. - Sit down. - She needs her pills, ah! - Don't hurt daddy! - Now get back to your seat! - Look at her, she needs her pills. - Look, we're all gonna die okay, some sooner than others. You wanna go first? - There's no reason to punish her. - All right, give her the pills, be a hero. You wanna get cuts in line, go ahead. - Oh nice work, medic. Hey you, help bring this man back to his seat. - This man can't sit in a seat, his leg has to be immobilized. - Well then open the door and throw him out, I'm not gonna have him blockin' the aisle. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with him? - He's sick. - How much longer? - Not much, don't tell me you're afraid of flying, Andrew. - I wasn't, not until now. - Well you better not be afraid of dyin', buddy. You knew that was an option when you signed on. - Go get your men ready, okay. Uh this is Leyton, deploy your men, hold your positions, over. - 10-4 deploying now. - Rock and roll. - Let's go, if you're coming. - I need some time with him. You have to let me feel him out, I know what I'm doing. - You still think that I was wrong in Phoenix don't you? - Kristen Teague died. - She would have died anyway. There was nothing any of us could have done to save her, and Cronin would have gotten away to kidnap somebody else's daughter. - All I'm asking is a chance to do my job. Let me try to negotiate. - All right, saddle up, let's go everyone, showtime. - What's it gonna be, Frank? - Ah, thanks. - These people are lucky you're on board. - Yeah well I doubt anyone on this plane's feeling very lucky. - Hey, that's enough talk, get away from him. - The tough guy forgot his bomb. - That's bull talk for a man with no legs. - Remote detonator. - That's right, so if you're thinking I jumpin' me. You were good back there, you know what you're doing under fire. Vietnam. You must lay awake nights cursing yourself for a fool. Crippled in a senseless war for a cause no one believed in. - I believed in it. - Did you now? I believed in my cause passionately. Then again, I was 15, it's a passionate age. I lost my dad, two uncles and my eldest brother. My mother was always burying someone. - The truce put you out of business. - Oh I got sense long before that. There's little romance in dying broke for a lost cause. - So now you just sell yourself to the highest bidder. - It's a living, and I get to see the world. - Andrew grew up in the IRA. It sounds like he's gone mercenary. - Daddy, I need the bathroom. - Okay, honey. - What? - Megan needs to use the restroom. - Okay. No, you stay. - Go ahead sweetheart. - It'll be okay. - Oh Peter, 20 million dollars worth of bearer bonds takes awhile to gather. We're working on it. Now, cash would be much easier, I'd have that for you by now. - With all the serial numbers recorded, really Deni, that's beneath you. - Okay, okay, okay. It's a risk, then you wouldn't be waiting around for the bonds. - I don't plan on waiting around, I thought I made that clear. Look, don't let Frank box us in here. You remember what happened last time. - Let's stay in the now, Peter. I told you the bonds'll be here, they'll be here. Now you could, you know, defuse the tension here with a little show of good faith. Come on Peter, show Frank he can trust you. How 'bout releasing some hostages, how about the children as a show of good faith. - Look, when we reach our final destination I'll release them all okay. Nobody leaves this plane until that time. Play your game Deni, not Frank's. People die when he wins. - You okay? - Are you going to kill me? - It's all gonna be over soon, okay? Come on. - Psst, I thought you might like this. - Thank you, I want a camera like that for Christmas. - I hope you get it. - Honey, what'd that girl give you? - She took my picture by mistake. - May I keep this for awhile? - Sure, you could put it in your wallet. - Thank you. The woman sitting in the second row to the right of the little girl is one of the hijackers, that's Shayna. And Andrew is in the background. - What's goin' on here, I thought we were gonna be down by now. - Hydraulic pressure's low, we may not be able to get the landing gear down. - Try your best, captain. - Gear down. - Was it good for you too? - The nose gear's not set. This indicator light should be green. - It's down, we felt it. - Well it may be down but if we're not locked the wheels'll fold up on landing, we'll belly flop. Advise Dallas tower of our situation, tell 'em to prepare for possible crash landing. - I've got three men in each firetruck, eight more in the ambulances. Best-case scenario for us is a crash landing. We can take advantage of the panic and confusion to access the plane. - All right, sounds like a good plan but I havn't made up my mind yet so, I want all my options in place. Get everything ready and I'll let you know. - TAA 285 heavy, you're clear to land on runway 23 right. Wind at 240 degrees at 30 knots, altimeter 30 times 15. Caution to possible wind shear on landing. Emergency vehicles are on the runway for you. - No, no, no, no! No emergency vehicles anywhere near this plane. Okay, tell them! - Come on if we crash land, we're gonna need some help. - No if we crash, we're dead! - Fire is a real probability, do you understand that? If the trucks can get to us in time, at least we'll have a chance. - I know Leyton okay, he's just looking for a chance to rush this plane, it's not gonna happen! - Look, this woman is in bad shape. I think she's having a heart attack. - Oh yeah, you got bigger problems. Go talk to your captain. - We have a situation here. It may be real, it may be somethin' the pilot cooked up. We may be crash landing. But, if this plane is stormed, you push the button Andrew. - Right. - Let me have a word with you. If Andrew falters, you kill him. And you detonate. - I love you, Peter. - It was a nice try, Ronnie, gutsy. - Thanks, but don't give up on us yet. Ladies and gentlemen this is Captain Mitchell. We'll be landing in a few moments. I'm afraid we have some minor equipment problems. Please pay close attention to your flight attendants as they demonstrate our emergency landing procedures. We better get 'em ready, Barbara. - This may be the best chance we've got. At least let me keep a couple of fire trucks out there. - You heard him Frank, if he sees any equipment near the runway he's gonna blow up the plane. - The plane may crash, damn it. What are we supposed to just stand by and watch those people burn? How do I justify withholding rescue efforts out of fear of what this freak may do? - All right, let's split the difference. Pull the equipment back, let the plane land. If there's a crash, take the gamble send in the firemen. If there's no crash, Cronin recognizes that we're taking him seriously. - I don't see why we should kowtow to the little-- - All right I'm pullin' everybody out of there now. Wait for my signal, if there's a fire you move in. - Hold on. - Remove all sharp objects from your pockets. If you're wearing glasses take them off. Put your pillows on your laps, lean forward and rest your heads against your knees. - How long? - One minute. Dallas tower we have runway lights in sight, two, three right. You better belt in. - Oh that's sweet, you care about what happens to me. - I don't want you bouncing around up here but maybe we'll get lucky and you'll be killed. - If anyone rushes this plane don't worry you two'll be the first to die, okay. - We're gonna be okay, Megan, we're gonna make it. - Oh! - You just keep your head down no matter what sweetheart, okay? - I'll ask God to save us. - Thank you. - So will we honey, so will we. - Wade, Wade, better help her into position. - Just put your head down on your pillow, old girl, there ain't nothin' to it. Oh my god, god she can't talk. - Just try to get her head down, we can't do anything until we land. Try, Wade. - Don't you leave me now, don't you do it. - Everyone stay in your seats. Anyone stands without permission will be shot. Stay in your seats, everybody close your window shades. - Close them, do it. - Check your side. - Close them! - Life goes on, congratulations. - She's dying. - Sit down, sit down, Wade. Come on, sit down. - Oh! - You need to keep in your seat. - I think she's had a heart attack, let me help. - Stewardess get over here. - They might let that old woman off the plane. - All right we need some help getting her out of this seat. Come on, Wade. - I'll help. - No. - Let him save her. - Please! - Brian oxygen, get the resuscitator. - All right. - Go ahead. - You got her? Watch her head. - Yeah, got it. - I got it, I got it. - Watch her head. She's in arrest, you resuscitate, I'll do compression. And one, two, three, four-- - Resuscitator. - Five. Breathe, one, two, three, four, five, breathe. - I'm very pleased with our progress, Deni. I'm sure Frank musta wanted to rush the plane as soon as we landed, huh? - His finger's still on the trigger you've gotta know that. - Well, so's mine. The next thing I wanna see Deni, is a fuel truck. Yeah, and don't let Frank do something stupid, like put SWAT guys on this plane. Where's the money? - On its way. Peter, we've done the right thing, right? We've shown a good faith. Don't you think we should get a little quid pro quo? Release some hostages. - No. - Look, Frank's got the SWAT leader in his face, pushing hard, now you're gonna give me a little breathing room if you just, release some kids. You know, give us both a little space here, ease things up while we're waiting for the fuel in the money. - No, Deni. Your job is to keep Frank from blowing up the plane, okay? You keep your mind on that. - We've got a pulse. - Here, thought I missed you. - Hey, hey, get back to your seats. - She's dying. - Get back, then let her die, okay. While you're standing here, the FBI could be storming this plane. Get back to your seats. - That was tense. Too real for me. - Yeah well, the flap damage could be real enough. There's no way of telling without taking a look at it. - Well it held find on landing, I mean, we got here didn't we? She'll still fly. - I don't want him to know that. From here on we're convinced this bird is mortally wounded. - And he may panic and blow us all to bits, come on. We play along, that's our best chance. - It's my call. - The fuel truck is on its way. How long does it take to refuel? - This plane is in trouble. That free fall did serious flap damage, I'm reading flatline in two hydraulic systems. We won't get off the ground. - And you said we'd crash land too, didn't you? What do you think, copilot? - Me, well it'd be a real bummer to get that 20 million and then die in a plane crash and not be able to spend it. You do wanna get out of the country, right? - When the time comes I'll let you know. - Well, doesn't matter anyway, we won't make it. - Look, the FBI is dancing to any tune you call. Ask for another plane, we'll crew it for you. That's your only chance. - You're lying. - Come on Cronin, you're the one with the guns and the bomb, you think we're gonna lie to you? - Come here. - Something's up. - The oxygen is almost gone. For the love of God, please let us get her help. - Look, no one is coming aboard this plane! - Then let us take her off. We can take her out and put her on the runway. We'll come back on board, they can send a couple of unarmed people to get her. - Look, you've got nothing to lose here and it's gonna show 'em that you're not heartless. - Okay, hero. - I'll help. - No, you're too emotional pops, okay. Anybody volunteering to help the hero take the old lady off the plane? - Right here. I'm with ya. - He's gonna release a hostage. - What's it gonna cost us? - I don't know yet, but it shows some flexibility, it's a start. - Hm. - Try anything, and people on this plane are gonna die. Go. - Hey! Hey! Hey! What in the hell the's matter with you? - I'm sor, I'm sorry. - You want those people to die? - No. - He's gonna kill my family. - No, no, no, no, just, I'm sorry. - Get up, get up! - Okay. - We're goin' back in, get up, get up! - Nice save, hero. Give 'em the signal. Don't look at me, stand there and watch. Keep it up. - Huh! - Done. - Go sit down, sit down. Get up, get up. - Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Sh, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. - Really, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. Why are you embarrassing yourself? - No, no-- - You're embarrassing yourself. Sh, sh, you're embarrassing yourself. - Okay, okay. - Shut up. - Okay, okay. - Okay, it's okay. - Okay. - It's okay. - It's okay, it's okay. - Okay, okay. - Sh, I just want you to turn around, so Frank can see. - Turn, turn around? - Yeah, just wave your hands. - Wave, wave my hands? - Just wave your hands. - I'm sorry okay, okay, turn around and wave. Wave. Uh! - Oh my god. - I shoulda let him go. I just shoulda let him go. He's dead because of me. No, Cronin killed him, not you. No telling how many people he would have killed if you let him get away. - That was a mistake. Now that he's killed somebody it gives the FBI an excuse to attack. - If that man gets away with disobeying orders then the others will get ideas. - But the threat's out there. There's a bloody army waiting in the dark. - And they will keep waiting. The last thing they want is another Waco or Ruby Ridge. Media'll crucify them if they lose this plane. - The aftermath won't mean a thing to us now will it? - Peter gives the orders, just do as you're told and shut up. - The bonds are here. Killing that man was a mistake, Peter. - Nothing's changed. - You're still in control, we all know that. But now there's a dead guy lying out there. It puts more pressure on Frank and undercuts my position, can you see that? Letting the old lady go was a good thing, everyone relaxed a bit. Now the needle's pegging in the red again. You could relieve the pressure, just release more hostages. - No, no, no, it's your turn, it's your turn, you do for me! I want another airplane fueled and I want it up here. - What about the bonds? - Send the bonds out here. We'll transfer 'em to the other plane when it's ready. - This is a major new wrinkle Peter, it's gonna take time. If I get a new plane for you, there should be some payback. What about more hostages? - Some more hostages, what about some more hostages? You know what, we're all going along for the ride here, including the crew. So you send out the bonds, and you take care of the airplane, and you don't let it take too long. Because bad things come to those that wait. - These start showin' up, I gotta show you this. - No, bring your people back in. - Excuse me, Deni, so where are we? - He wants another airplane, theirs is too badly damaged to take off. - Damaged from what? That plane can practically fly on one wing. I mean the storm couldn't have hurt it that badly. - Well trust me, Cronin's way too smart to risk that kind of exposure unless he thinks it's necessary. - You know Frank, thinks could be the operative word here. What if the pilot's doing a con job on him. That would explain her acrobatics up there. Diving down into the storm, the possible crash landing. She could be trying to force him out into the open. - That's pretty gutsy if that's true. - He's taking everyone with him onto the second plane, crew included, and he wants the bonds now. I think we should send him the money, it'll give me more time with him. - No, no, we'll send part of it now. That'll keep him busy until we can get the other plane ready. Baker, I wanna talk to you about getting your people on that other plane. - He's expecting that, Frank. - Excuse me, sir. - Did you get anything out of the old woman? - She's still unconscious but take a look at these. They found these on her. - Son of a, who's got a recorder? Somebody got a recorder that will fit this size tape? - There's one over here, sir. - Officer, you have a call. - I'll call you back later. - My name is Steven Paulsen. I'm a passenger on flight 285. At approximately 8:45 this evening, November 22nd, this plane was hijacked. There are three of them that I know of. There might be more of them up at first class. - Deni. Deni, I'm bored here, do you think Frank needs to be reminded to take me seriously or are the bonds on their way? - Frank just gave me the thumbs up to send you half the money? - Half, what half, what are you deaf? Are you jerking me around, are you trying to waste my time? You want me to waste some of your time? Open the door. - Oh geez no, no, no. No! - Cronin, if you kill them the FBI'll storm this plane guaranteed. They're not gonna stand by and watch federal agents murdered. - True. I want to make a point, not start a war. They seem willing to tolerate civilian casualties. So I'll kill somebody else. You pick hero. - No. - No, well then, I guess it's you. - No, listen, they will give you the money. They don't wanna lose any more of us. - You got somethin' to say mom? - Nobody has to die here. Play the game with them, the more you give, the more they give back. You're controlling the board. - Oh I'm controlling the board, huh? - Yes. - The more I give, right? So I let a couple people off this plane why, because it's my choice? I bet you'd love your family to be the first ones off the plane, wouldn't you? - I'm sorry Peter, I'm doing the best I can. - Deni, I see Frank's fingerprints all over this stall. Let me anticipate him. If I release more hostages, he'll give me the bonds. - I won't argue with that. - Okay then just send me my money, and I'll release 50 more people. - Half if you give us a hundred. - You first. - I got him, look at this. Andrew Leary, uh, he's former IRA, but now he's freelancing. - Shayna Loring, arrested for criminal vandalism, Teague Data Systems, Phoenix. The summer before the kidnapping, while Cronin was working for the company. - She and Andrew might have been the ones that killed the girl and got away. - He's recreated Phoenix, his team versus ours. - Yeah, except this time he's got two hundred hostages. - We can save half of 'em right now. - Come on. You two, go, move. Go with mom. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The hero and his wife stay. Little kid can go, they stay. - Come on, bring your dolly to keep you company. - I won't, I'm not gonna leave you, and I'm not gonna leave - Sweetheart, we are gonna be fine, please go, go on. - you and daddy. - Meg, Meg, you gotta go, it's okay. - Sweetheart, please go. - It's okay, Megan, Megan, it's okay, Megan go. - You, come on. Faster. - Yes. - It's him, he wants to talk to you. - As soon as they're all on the bus we'll send you the bonds. - Excellent. I want the new plane brought up. We're all gettin' kinda restless here. Oh, and Denny, you bring me my money, personally. See I think Frank might get some really stupid idea to put SWAT guys on the new plane. And I think that by you being there might help him reconsider. If you're not on the runway in five minutes, I'm gonna start thinning out this herd. See you soon. - All right. - No, dammit, no, absolutely not, that is not going to happen. - Just give me some time with them, I think I can talk them out. - I can't go along with it. That's against every policy. - It's a chance. And the last one we could get. If I'm wrong, come rescue me. - I can't believe Frank agreed to this. - He didn't. - Hey, let's just lean against this chair, okay. Spread your legs. I know that sounds so crass for our first date. Where's my money, Deni? - Right behind me. - I can see the baggage tram comin' out. - Why am I here, Peter? You think Frank is gonna change his game plan if it puts me in the line of fire, is that it? - Well the thought did cross my mind. Let's go up front, huh? - You don't know the man. - What, you know him so well, huh? You know him so well, that's why you agreed to come, right? Frank, you still there? - Yeah, I'm here. - Listen Frank, I just wanna tell you, if you try anything, anything at all Deni here'll be the next one that I kill. - That gives you a clear picture, huh? - Sure does. - Well make sure you see up the new plan, Frank. I don't wanna walk too far. - Okay, there are three hijackers, Cronin and these two. - We're ready to move as soon as they board the second plane. We won't have time to wait on you order, Frank. - All right, well consider it a green light once they leave the primary aircraft. - There's the other plane. - $20 million and a full tank, think of the possibilities. - You, come here. Come here. Let's go. Okay, right there. Now Frank has been given fair warning. I will kill you if he tries something. You think he believes me? - Yes. - So then he wouldn't do anything stupid, like put agents on board this plane, now would he? Huh? You're gonna go check it out for us. And then you're come back here and you're gonna tell me if the plane's empty. And if you're lying, I'm gonna kill your little girl, okay. - I know you're frightened, but please believe me when I tell you, we're doing what has to be done to save you and the other passengers. And you have got to tell Cronin the plane is empty. - So? - SWAT's all over the plane. - You mean nothing to him, nothing! - Peter. - And you're dead. And all these people are dead because he has to win! - You've got $20 million and an airplane, Peter. You can still make it. You still have the power, Frank knows that. You've gotta keep it together. You've gotta keep it together. Let me talk to Frank. - I'm through talkin'. She moves, you shoot her, okay. Start the engines, we're taking off. - Nothing's changed, we won't get off the ground. - Start the engines, or I'm gonna put a bullet in his heart, okay? Do it. - What's he doing? - Oh no. - The pilot said the plane was damaged, we couldn't take off. - Right, we're all gonna die. As long as Peter's in charge, we're all dead. There's nothing to lose. He'd rather be dead than go to jail. - Shut up. - You love him don't you, Shayna? - I said shut up. - Andrew, this plane's gonna crash. You don't want to burn to death. - Stay! - You can walk away from this, Andrew, you can live. Look around you. You can save these people, you Andrew. - Dammit. Let's go, move! - Everybody. - Let's go, move out. - Come on, let's go. - I have to request takeoff instruction. - No, just get this plane in the air. - Baker. When the plane starts its take off roll, we kill the runway lights. You gotta figure the crew will abort. I want full deployment the second the runway goes dark. - Very good. - I'll do my best for you, I promise. What you do here will stand in your favor. - I'll be tried for murder, you know that. You can save your lies. I'll not live out my days in a cage. - No Shayna, no! - I know my wife's gonna be waiting for me, I just don't know whether it's going to be on this side or the next. Thanks again, Ben. - Kill the light, we're a go, Baker. - Forget about the runway lights, let's go. - We don't have enough runway left. - Lady, life's a gamble, let's move okay. - Let's go, open this car door. - Take off now, or I'm gonna put one in his head! - Don't do it, Ronnie. - I can't, I won't do it to those people. - Let me show you what's gonna happen to these people. Do it, Andrew! Blow that bomb, let's do it, detonate! - Move, move, move, move. - Ah! Ah-ah! - All right, let's go. - Target's secured, you got an agent down in here Frank. - It's all over, everybody. File on out, please ladies. - Hang on, Deni. You did it, you saved 'em. - How many did we lose? - I don't know, not many. - And Cronin? - He's dead, come on. There you go. - I'm so proud of you. - Captain Mitchell, Frank Leyton, FBI. We got a lot to talk about, you did a hell of a job. - Yeah, well thanks, um, I had some help from my first officer, Ron Showman. - I was uh, just along for the ride. - Well it was a hell of a ride. - I don't need a doctor, I just need an aspirin. - Excuse me, my wife, Helen, Helen Kale. - She's gonna make it. Come on, I'll take you to her. - This is ridiculous, I can walk. - Procedure, Deni, just relax. You got a gang of press waitin' for you. You're gonna be on page one all over the world. - Yeah right, and you're gonna be standing right in front of me, huh partner? - Okay Frank, what do I tell the press? They're gonna want a statement. - Tell 'em it's over, and the good guys won.
