Thank you. How long is she gonna be there? Well, the wife's mother, she's taking longer to die than we thought. You said she never liked you. No. I said she thought I was the wrong guy. Boy, that's good coffee. Maybe not quite as good as a macchiato after carbonara at Adriano's. But that's certainly good coffee for fast food coffee. What's the name of this place again? - Franco's. - Franco's. I didn't think the state homicide commander did stakeouts. - It's not a stakeout. - Feels like a stakeout. No, I just want to see how long this guy's gonna stay in there. Because? Because I didn't think he'd stay in there this long. Franco's had pizza. Should I go back? - I told you we had to make a stop. - You did. - We'll have dinner at Adriano's. - Tonight? Tonight. Okay? We've managed to stabilize him. If he makes it, we'll have to open him up again when he's stronger. That's all we know. You're a member of Mr. Healy's immediate family? It's Captain Healy. And no, I'm not. His wife is in Seattle. Someone has to sign for his valuables. His badge. His gun. - I'll take them. - You're a fellow officer? - Yes. - Could I see your badge? It's in a drawer. You were with him? Yes. That his blood on you? Some of it. I'll get them. Good morning. She's interviewing the candidate, Lou. - I'm Jesse. - I know. If you keep calling me Lou, Suitcase, I'm going to call you Luther. Why would I call you Lou, Jesse? - Sorry I'm late. - Chief Stone! William Butler. Nice to meet you. Rose, I didn't mean to interrupt. Yeah, we were up to the Boston PD which you left in... May, 2002. At which point I moved to Springfield and joined the force there. I was the CJIS liaison to the staties. What is CJIS liaison to the staties? - Criminal Justice Information Services. - Computers? Yes, but I want to get back to hands-on policing. Well, we're hands-on here. I guess that's all, unless you have anything, Jesse. I do. Did you leave your last two jobs or were you let go? - I beg your pardon? - You didn't hear me? I heard you. I left. - Thank you very much, Mr. Butler. - It was a pleasure. We'll let you know. - Where were you? - I got stuck in traffic. From your house? No, from Boston. - What did you think? - Well, he has a very impressive resume. - I don't like him. - Why not? - He's over-qualified. - Well, so were you. Jesse, Carter Hansen wants to see you over at City Hall. - Did he say why? - No. My sense is that it's urgent. - Any comment? - They misspelled Healy. Well, they got your name right. Another shooting incident. What were you doing there? Talking to a friend. Did this stakeout have anything to do with Paradise? It wasn't a stakeout. Did it have anything to do with this town? - No. - You were moonlighting. Actually I was drinking coffee. When the Town Council hired you, we made it clear that the Paradise Chief of Police does not have a 9:00 to 5:00 job. I know that. And with the departure of Officer D'Angelo, it's more important than ever for you to be here. To show the flag, so to speak. So how did the interview go this morning? What interview? The candidate seems highly qualified. I don't think hiring your son-in-law is a good idea. Strike that. For the record, Paradise promotes tourism, not crime. Crime is bad for business. And some of your exploits garner headlines that we don't need and we don't appreciate. I see it as my job not to look the other way. Well, I've called a meeting of the full council for 10:00 tomorrow morning. - Good for you. - We can fire you. You can. But you can't tell me what to do. Mrs. Healy called. She just got back. She said, "Thanks for saving his life." She told me what happened. Why didn't you? Old habit. Who's that? I don't know. No one tells me anything around here. Jesse. Why don't you come in, Suit? - Can I? - You can. Jesse, this is Elizabeth Blue. Her baby was kidnapped a few years ago. She thinks he might be in Paradise. Where was the baby kidnapped? - Albuquerque, New Mexico. - Little Boy Blue. It was all over the news. That was quite a while ago, wasn't it? December 28, 2000. Seven years. Wasn't the body recovered? - You know this case? - Know of. That wasn't my baby. I thought the body was identified. My husband... A baby's body was found in a dry river bed near the Mexican border. It had the hospital wristband on it. But it was... Decomposed. My husband had the remains buried. He didn't think that I was strong enough to see it. And you think your son is alive and here in Paradise. - I know it. - You got a feeling? Why do you think he's here, Elizabeth? I received an anonymous letter. It said, "Your child is loved." And it was postmarked Paradise. Did you get any other letters? - Yes. - From other places? - Yes. - How many? Hundreds. So why Paradise? Because this one haunts me. "Your child is loved." I just want my son back. Mrs. Blue, anybody could have written that letter. You are looking at the entire Paradise Police force. A letter like that... I don't think there's anything we can do to help you. I'm sorry. I have to get back to Boston in the morning. I have to be in Albuquerque for work and I can't miss my bus. If you have to use that, you're going to have problems. - The safety's on the wrong side. - The safety's on the wrong side. You could install an ambidextrous safety. I don't like them. They break too easily. Too much torque. You're doing a lot better, Rose. That one would have definitely ruined someone's evening. When were you planning on telling me you were shot? Clearly, I didn't need to. Why do I get the feeling that's only one shoe? You're not even going to try to look for that woman's baby? This is a small town. How hard can it be? That kidnapping was all over the news, Rose. This is a small town. Exactly. Someone would have noticed a new baby without a pregnancy, Rose. Maybe they didn't move here until later. Just so they could send an incriminating letter? Who's they and how do you find them? I don't know. What do you think, Suit? What do I think or what do I feel, Lou? Either one. I feel the baby's dead. Jesse, where are you? He's been sitting here for half an hour. I guess I'll start the interview without you. You need to get a cell phone. Jesse, it's Jenn. I need you to call me tonight. It's about Elliot. I was hoping to talk to you. I... - Hello. - Hello, Jesse. - Hello, Jenn. - How are you? - Fine. - Are you alone? No. I'm talking with you, Jenn. Are you drinking? I'm having my first of two Scotches. Jesse, why do you drink when you're alone? You sound like your psychiatrist. He's your psychiatrist, Jesse. Okay. Jesse, I still care about you. It's about Elliot. He wants me to move in with him. Okay. How do you feel about that? How do I feel about that? It would be unethical. What are you talking about? A Hollywood weather girl living with her producer. What are you looking at? So you know who the shooter was? Healy couldn't say. Is he gonna make it? I don't know. I'm going in this morning. Did you hit the guy? I would say yes, with my second shot. It's got to have something to do with who he was staking out. Did he tell you who? He got evasive. You know. You were a cop. Which means it has something to do with who he was staking out. - Jenn's moving in with her producer. - Elliot? The guy who had sex with my wife two days after our "let's get acquainted with my new boss" dinner. So how do you feel about that? How do I feel about that? I don't know. Maybe you should ask Suitcase. - He didn't make Jenn do it, did he? - He's on my list. What list is that? Jenn called you before I started here. Yeah, she did. - What did she tell you? - I can't tell you that. What can you tell me? I can tell you that two drinks alone at night is a lousy rule. It's not a rule. Exactly. So did you go in the tank after she called? Almost. - So you called me. - Yeah. Why? Because I really like you. Why don't you kiss my ass? Every time we start to figure something out, you make some wiseass remark or you take a hike on me. - Who kidnaps babies? - What? I want to know who kidnaps babies. It's my time. I pay you 165 bucks an hour. 180 bucks an hour. Is this something we're investigating? No. In the old days, it was people who couldn't have babies or lost a baby, nowadays it's a service industry. People steal babies to sell them. Or their parts. Why so early? - I got a Town Council meeting. - They're on your ass. Small town. Police department down to three. Well, two and one with his hand tied behind his back. Suit's on Light Ad actually, it's one and two people with one hand tied behind their back. You're up to your shorts in an attempted murder or murder of a police officer. Two police officers. You fired your weapon. You're gonna need a good lawyer. - It's just Internal Affairs. - Exactly. You're gonna need a good lawyer. Did you get shot in the arm? - Yes. - Did they give you a sling? Yes. So you're choosing not to help yourself get better. I sense a parable. Come on in, Jesse. - This is great! - Excuse me? This is my first non-fatal bullet wound. You're lucky. No bone. Just soft tissue. Looks like they did a good job. No infection. Stitches have pulled a little bit. They should be okay if you're careful. - Shouldn't you have a sling? - I said I didn't need one. Pediatricians don't deliver babies. We attend the birth. How hard is it to access birth records, Doc? Well, in a big city, you'd need some sort of court order, but here... - Why? - No reason. I see you got new business cards. Peter Perkins. PediatricianlMedical Examiner. I'm proud to be your Medical Examiner. But you keep them in a little plastic hippo. What can I say? You made me a hyphenate. I'm proud of being a pediatrician, too. Sorry. I was fighting crime. Chief Stone, losing Officer D'Angelo was a serious blow to the Paradise Police Department. Yeah, and last month, Officer Gammon wrote 47 tickets, Officer D'Angelo wrote 174 tickets, Officer Simpson was on Light Administrative duties, and you wrote six. I'm the Police Chief. D'Angelo was the Babe Ruth of parking tickets. And you drove him out. - I may have. - Why? I didn't like him. So how's Officer Simpson doing? I'd like to release him from Light Ad. No adverse effects from the coma? - None. - We'll take it under consideration. - Who's manning the entrance to town? - The speed trap? Now, strike that. - No one. - Why not? I don't think it's ethical. It brings in a lot of revenue. - You like movies, Chief Stone? - Good ones. Yeah, well we think you police this town like a cowboy sheriff in a bad movie. We think? I think you're making up your own rules. - Like Little Bill Daggett. - Excuse me? Gene Hackman in Unforgiven. I would prefer that you think of me as a benevolent Gene Hackman. Boy, that was a good movie. Well, cinema commentary aside, Morris. Get this, Chief Stone. We know we can't fire you without notice. But we do have other options. You could be suspended. We could dock your pay. But whatever we choose to do, consider yourself warned. It's hard to move on. I had a few questions. You changed your mind? No, I didn't. You said you got a letter? - This the original envelope? - Yes, Chief Stone. Jesse. Jesse. Why would somebody write you five years later? As you know, the press had a field day with my baby's kidnapping. "Little Boy Blue" was just too good a headline. I think the story finally disappeared when a pop singer went into rehab for the 14th time. A cable station did a fifth anniversary show. And they asked me about my son. And you said you had a feeling your son was still alive. I still do. - And that started the letters? - That inspired that letter. Why'd you wait so long after receiving it? My husband kept it from me. He didn't think I should see it. How did you feel about that? I left him. Because of this letter? Our marriage had deteriorated to such a point that... Basically, yes. Bus number 24, West Bound Service... Knoxville, Little Rock, Albuquerque... I have to go back to work. Now boarding at platform A6. Send me everything you have overnight. You'll find my son? I didn't say that. His name is Adam. Eileen? - I don't know, Eileen. - Captain Healy, everything's okay. - Eileen? - You're going to be feeling some gas. - It's okay to release it. - I'll stay anyway. Press that if anything happens. Eileen? Could I have some ice? How close was I? You were definitely circling the drain. So who do you think shot you? I didn't see the shooter. Did you? I think I shot him. Did you know him? Not in silhouette. I ran everybody in the building. No priors. Who were you staking out? - Don't get into that. - I have to. - Why? - Because he shot me, too. Come here. I was keeping an eye on my nephew. Okay. My sister thinks he's having an affair with his saxophone teacher. Okay. He's 18, she's 35. So was he? So tell me, did you ever have an affair with an older woman? Yes. You? Yes. - Bear any psychological scars? - No. Just fond memories. So who do you think shot you? I haven't a clue. Okay. This is Jim Kennedy, the governor's Chief of Staff. The governor was just visiting the State Homicide Commander who is recovering from his second surgery in two days and we seem to be missing something here. We're missing 24 hour police protection. Do it. Where were you? Out drinking all night. Give me a straight answer, you son of a bitch. Healy's going to live. I'm sorry, Jesse. If he survives the gas. You are a son of a bitch. I want to find Little Boy Blue. If you find him, see if he took a shot at Healy. Somebody wrote that letter. They know where he is. The baby is in his grave. And if he's not, he could be any place. The letter tells us nothing. It said, "Your child is loved." "Is loved." As in, "God loves all children." Or as in, "The writer is crazy." Jesse, she came all this way on hope. Two thousand miles on a bus. Don't you think we owe her? What if he lived here and moved away? What if he never lived here but just stopped by to mail the letter? What if some vacationing tourist decided to send an encouraging note? Jesse, I know I'm not an experienced cop like you. But what are we doing here if we won't look for a little lost boy? You can only do what you can do. But he might be here! She needs to know that somebody did absolutely everything they could to find him. I can't justify opening up a seven-year-old out-of-state kidnapping. - We have to try! - I won't. Paradise is my last stop, Rose. There's nowhere to go from here. Then I'm going to do it. On my own time. - I can't stop you. - Yes, you can. - But I won't. - Good. What are you thinking? I was thinking, if I ever get kidnapped, I hope you're on the case. Could the shooter have been after you? - No. - Because? Why go after me from the driver's side? - Did you discharge your weapon? - I did. - How many discharges? - Two. - Any shooting incidents in L.A. Homicide? - Yes. - How many? - One. - Fatality? - Are you asking me or reading about it? Chief Stone, you have been Police Chief of Paradise for almost three years. That's correct. How many shooting incidents? - Six. - Four. Twice the sentence was carried out for me. "The sentence." That's an interesting take on police work. - Four. - Fatalities? - Four. - Rather conspicuous use of deadly force. Why use deadly force if it isn't deadly? Chief Stone, you are aware that... That as a good guy, I am responsible for every round from the moment it leaves the barrel until it reaches its final resting place. You said you think you may have hit the assailant with one shot? That's correct. Where did the other one go, Chief Stone? Jesse. Where did the other one go, Chief Stone? Into a brick wall. How long have you been in Internal Affairs? Almost three years. Ever been in the field, Officer Greenstreet? Sidney. - You ever been in the field, Sidney? - I have, Jesse. - You ever shot anybody, Sidney? - I have. It's... Disturbing. Are you married, Sidney? Divorced. As are you. Jesse. Jesse. Use your body. Use your body. Hello. And you are? You don't remember me? I remember the hat. PPD. Paradise. I'd like to speak to Mr. Fish. Mr. Fish is not in. - Alan... - You remember me. Alan, he's right over there. Mr. Fish is not in. If Mr. Fish were in, I think I'd know about it. Jesse Stone. Mr. Fish is in. I had nothing to do with shooting Captain Healy. Actually, I was hoping you could help me acquire some methamphetamines. I read about it in the paper. Shooting cops is bad for business? Exactly. You hear things. Well, I hear lots of things. Why would I tell you? - Because you really like me. - I didn't shoot anyone. I know. So why did you come to me? You're the only mobster I know. You knew my friend Leo Finn. And you killed him. Actually his bodyguard killed him. Lovey Norris was trying to shoot you. - How do you know? - Assumption. Good assumption. Suffice it to say, but for your exasperating directness, my friend would still be alive. - He wasn't your friend. - Colleague. - We went to the same church. - You were choir boys together? I didn't say that. - So you won't help me. - No. You could keep your eyes and ears open. I always do. It's nice to see you, Jesse Stone. Come on, come on. Pick it up, pick it up. How's the crime scene at Paradise Donuts? Under constant surveillance. I feel donuts certify one's copness. - No coffee? - My body's a temple. - You want one? - My body's a temple. - You just getting back from Boston? - How do you know I was in Boston? The information's out there. All you have to do is let it in. - So who shot Healy? - I have no idea. My sense is it had something to do with the stakeout. It had nothing to do with the stakeout. - So you think. - So Healy knows. He was monitoring a saxophone lesson. Which leaves me nowhere. Stir the pot. We going after this? I'm going after this. You still seeing Cissy Hathaway? What do you mean? - Well, she's older. - How did you know? The information's out there. All you have to do is let it in. - Do you feel damaged in any way? - No. - Cissy teach you anything? - A lot. Well, there you go. How'd the Town Council meeting go? You pick a fight? No. Maybe we should start manning the speed trap. I don't like the speed trap. I know, "The speed trap isn't ethical." Speeding is speeding, Jesse. It's the law. The speed limit changes. And nobody can see the sign. Exactly. You want to man it, man it. - Getting shot didn't slow you down. - How do you know? Guess we'll have to wait until you're healed and try again. I like the word "again." So, Sidney... - Did your wife remarry, Jesse? - No, Sidney. Now that we've had sex, do you think we could stop with the whole first name ping-pong? Of course, Sidney. I just like saying it. Who was Healy staking out? You're interrogating me in your underwear. - I'm asking you a question. - It wasn't a stakeout. My husband just told me his new wife is having a baby. My wife... Ex-wife just moved in with her boyfriend. So we're both feeling kind of disposable and in desperate need of consolation. And would be inclined to turn a casual something into more than it was. On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with consolation. So you think we should be careful. I think we should carefully do this again. Pals who have sex. I've heard it described as that. I like you, Sidney. You're the first person I've met on the entire East Coast who's more afraid of commitment than I am. Ever had sex with a younger man, Sidney? - Why do you ask? - I'm conducting a survey. Nothing to say to each other afterwards. But the young man had a hell of a ride. I'll let myself out. Don't get up. I prefer to think of you lying there in your afterglow. Overwhelming evidence points in the other direction, but there is no doubt in my mind that that baby was switched for Adam. Do you have any proof? I just know. - You're early. - You're earlier. You have a phone message on your desk. - Who was it? - He wouldn't say. I've been up all night. I couldn't sleep. How do I do it, Jesse? - I use Scotch. - How do I find Adam? - What have you got? - I don't have anything. - We always have something. - We? Figure of speech. Just start at the beginning. December 28th, 2000, Adam Blue is born. The next day, he disappears from his hospital bed in Albuquerque. Remains with his wrist ID end up near the Mexican border six months later. The authorities assumed the kidnappers escaped across the border. Well, they wanted a closed case. The Feds'll do that. You know, that river runs from Albuquerque right down to where the body was found. How do you know that? I played Triple-A ball in Albuquerque. Anyway, it all but dries up in the summer. They find a body snagged on a branch. But it could have been dumped in Mesita or anywhere upstream. Isn't Mesita where the body was found? It's a little town. 923 people. No Medical Examiner. No tests. No ID, except for the father. How do you know this? What's this? - Some stuff. - Where'd you get it? - Mailman. - It's from Albuquerque! When did you talk to the mother? You believe the boy is alive. No, I don't. But I do believe Elizabeth deserves a decent investigation. She sure hasn't gotten one so far. She needs to move on. The only thing that will let her is certainty. - So you're gonna help me? - No. Well, it seems to me we could find a 7-year-old boy a lot quicker - if we were working on this together. - What do you need me for? You've just narrowed it down by age and gender. What else do you know? There are 40,000 7-year-old boys in this state. - And how many in Essex County? - Five thousand. - And how many in Paradise? - About 67. Well, just find out where they were born. You know, you keep this up, you'll make detective some day. We don't have detectives. No, but if we did. Be careful with that. - What is it? - A letter. Thank you for not wearing your stupid hat. The hat, in and of itself is not stupid. - Because? - Because I designed it. Will you excuse us for a moment, Alan? Please. There... There might be somebody who works for somebody. Would this somebody who works for somebody be involved in prostitution? Teenage prostitution. I've heard you have scruples about that. Where on earth would you get such an idea? From Captain Healy, our gravely wounded friend. He's not a friend. This somebody might hold a grudge. Do you have a name? No, you do your job, you'll figure it out. Everybody says that. You a Red Sox fan, Gino? When they're winning. Well, you know, the hardest thing to hit is a triple. With your scruples about prostitution, you give up drugs and gambling, that would be a triple. You can leave now, Jesse Stone. Talk to me. Sister Mary John. Jesse Stone. You're a long way from Paradise. Why would you remember me? You caught the killer of one of my girls. - You're in my good book. - You have a bad book? - Oh, yeah. - I'm looking for someone in there. You want a coffee? I would never turn down such an offer, Sister. In my line of work, I find it best to be totally honest. I remembered you because I saw your name in the paper. I'm hurt. This is about the shooting? It is. Whoever did it was involved in teenage prostitution. - How do you know? - I can't tell you. My girls aren't always prostitutes. I know that. - I think you're a good guesser. - And you need a good guesser? I do. I'm looking for someone capable of conduct without conscience. - And who runs a string of pimps? - That's correct. Bixy Chapelle. Bixy Chapelle is the boss. I'm looking for a guy who works for him. Somebody who likes to get even. Pauly Palmieri. Teddy Leaf. Winston Monroe. - How do you know? - They're on my list. They've all had girls disappear. Thank you. I know you're a nun, but maybe we could have dinner some time. I'd like that. I know you won't give him up, but maybe you could tell me who it isn't. Pauly Palmieri. Teddy Leaf. Winston Monroe. One and three. Hey, brother, you got any spare change? No, do you? How many quarters you got? Six. I'll give you five bucks for them. You're welcome. Jesse, where are you? I paged you. That was you? That was me. Councilman Comden dropped by. - He's okay. - How do you know? He likes movies. Listen, is Suitcase there? No, he's out manning the speed trap. Showing the flag. How's he doing? Well, he called me on his cell phone and said he hasn't written a single ticket. Does he know why? - No. - Well, don't tell him. - Don't tell him what? - Never mind. I took Doc Perkins the names of all the 7-year-old boys in the Paradise school system. And he was at the birth of every one of them. Small town. He said you brought the subject up. Hey, what about the homeschooled kids? Well, how would you find them? I guess I'd have to talk to the school board. Yeah, their parents would need a permit. Carter Hansen's wife is chairman of the school board. Do you want him to know that we're investigating a seven-year-old out-of-state kidnapping? You're investigating a seven-year-old out-of-state kidnapping. You'll find a way, Rose. Eileen thought I was looking a little peaked. So I'm taking some sun. I'm like a character in Little Women. This is my nephew, Michael. Michael. He was on his way to his saxophone lesson. Pleased to meet you, sir. Jesse. You're enjoying your saxophone lessons, Michael? - I'm learning a lot. - I'll bet you are. - And he's getting better and better. - You must have a good teacher. I should get going. It was nice to meet you, sir. You're blocking my light. - The IA lady came by. - Greenstreet. - She question you? - Yeah. She's a babe. - I didn't notice. - You don't think she's attractive? I heard a name, Teddy Leaf. Thinks he's a tough guy. Tries to prove it by beating on his women. He once punched a kid named Linny Dale so many times her heart stopped. Did you nail him for it? No, I didn't have enough. I got him on a lesser. - Couldn't let it go? - Wouldn't let it go. - You think he shot me? - Us. Do you think he shot us? Hell, I have no idea. For a while I thought your nephew shot us. - It was just a guess. - It's a good guess. One problem. He's doing a nickel in Concord. Okay. - Your bust. - My bust. But then the Boston PD would know that. But a hotshot sheriff from Paradise wouldn't. Leaf is a bad guy and you have no authority here. I'm still State Homicide Commander. And I am telling you, do not pursue this. Hey, I'm just a small town cop. Mostly I give out parking tickets. I'm telling you not to pursue this. - I have plans this evening. - This won't take long. - What makes you so sure? - I need you to run a name for me. Is that all you need? No. But it will have to do. - What's the name? - Teddy Leaf. We already brought him in for questioning. - I thought he was in Concord. - He got out on parole a month ago. - You take his shirt off? - No. Just yours. He came in with his attorney. He has an airtight triple-witness alibi. A family function. There's nothing we can do. - You could give me his picture. - That's probably unethical. - That hasn't stopped us so far. - You're a bad boy. I am. There's Teddy. Could you print that for me? - There's haunts and associates. - Print that. That's illegal. It's okay. I'm a doctor. Great coffee. Where do you get it? - You're in my chair. - It's a lot better than my coffee. You want to wear my hat? Where you been? Fighting crime. Where you been? - Working on the shooting? - Yes. - Why are you here? - Did you find the trigger? I've got a name. He's got an airtight alibi. Airtight is where all the fun begins. Guy's got two felony convictions. In L.A., I'd just get him on something else and put him away for good. Why not here? No three strikes. Two-time loser gets pinched for anything more than littering, and a judge can put him away for a long time. I spent a lot of time in an office like this when I was a cop. You miss it? Every day. You could go back. Toxic for me. Me, too. Nothing happens here. You okay? You got plans tonight? That don't involve me and network TV? Yes. No. I'll buy you dinner. I'd like that. I'm taking you off Light Ads, Suit. Do you mean it? - Yes. - The Town Council okay it? They will. How about a donut, Rose? They're coply. Jesse? - My body's a temple. - Clearly you've transcended. - Suit, I need you to do me a favor. - Anything, Jesse. He's not here, Jesse. I talked to the school board. I told Hansen's wife I was thinking of homeschooling my youngest. She gave me all the names. There are no 7-year-old boys. There aren't even six or 8-year-old boys. Well, maybe you need to expand the search. Check 7-year-olds in Swampscott and Beverly. But the letter was mailed from Paradise. You've been looking for someone who's here in the second grade. You need to be looking for someone who was in kindergarten two years ago. Because? The only way I'd write a letter like that would be if I was moving, leaving town for good. If that letter was postmarked two years ago, you need to check enrollment for two years ago. I need to go back to the beginning. You showing the flag? They need to see you in the trenches, Jesse. I wrote four tickets. Four parking tickets. Nothing at the speed trap? You know, there was a tree in front of the sign and somebody cut it down. A vandal? A police chief. Okay. This guy, Teddy Leaf, is a real creature of habit. He eats lunch at 12:00 at the same place every day and whoever drew up his haunts list did a fine job, I added a timeline. - That's good police work, Suit. - I really appreciate this. I feel like I'm all the way back, Lou. Just don't tell the Town Council where you were. Jesse! Eric Morton. Born December 28, 2000. - Same day as Adam Blue. - Parents? Stephanie Morton, mother. No father listed. Is there a work address? I don't want to talk in front of the kid. - It could be just a coincidence. - Cops don't like coincidences. - You think he's alive. - I want him to be. Did you draw me in or did I do it to myself? It's just who you are, Jesse. Excuse me. - Are you Stephanie Morton? - Yeah. I'm Chief Stone. This is Officer Gammon. - Hi. - Is there a problem? - Do you own a green Dodge? - Yeah. - Have you used it today? - No. What about lunch? I make my own. I have a vegetable garden. - Jesse, we don't need to bother this woman. - Excuse me, Rose. A green Dodge was used in a hold-up of a convenience store. We didn't get the license number, so we're just checking everyone that we can. Have you loaned your car to anyone, Stephanie? - No. - Is this your son? - Yeah, that's my Eric. - He's gorgeous. Rose, do you mind? Could your husband have taken the car? I'm not married. I don't know who Eric's father is. I had a lot of issues back then. Drugs. Eric changed all that. From the first time I held him in my arms. Well, listen, I don't think there is anything to be concerned about. There's probably a hundred green Dodges in the county. So, thank you. Nice to meet you, Stephanie. We could have pushed harder. If she thinks we suspect, she could run. Should we talk to the son? What's he gonna tell us? We can't risk it. Jesse, what if this is a coincidence? You take any group of 23 kids, and odds are two of them will have the same birthday. - You made that up. - No, I didn't. - How do you know? - I just know. You know, if we're wrong about this, we damage a couple of lives. So what are we going to do? Knock on doors and accumulate data. But she did it. She's the one. - Last call. - I'm good. You shot me. - Who the hell are you? - State Homicide. Let me see your hands. I believe you know the position. You got a badge? - Yeah? So? - You armed? No, that would be a violation of my parole. You a little sore there, Teddy? - I'm the one who shot you. - I don't know what you're talking about. You tried to kill my friend. I've already been through this with the Boston cops. I saw you. And I have three people that saw me elsewhere. Well, I got a witness. A reluctant witness, but we got him on a drug charge. He'll give you up. Just when things were going so well for you. I'll see you around, Teddy. - I'm here! - Sorry to bother you, ma'am. - It's no problem. - Rose Gammon. Paradise Police. We were told that a green Dodge was parked outside all night long. - Could you verify that? - Well, that's Stephanie's car. Oh, sure. It's always there. - How long have you lived here, Mrs... - Steinberg. I've lived here forever. Well, the green Dodge was involved in the holdup of a convenience store. And we just wanted to be sure that hers hadn't been stolen. Well, I don't sleep well. It was here all night. Okay. Good. Thank you. We already interviewed Mrs. Morton. She seems very nice. Freeze-dried hippie, but she turned her life around. How long has she lived here? Stephanie grew up in that house. Her mother gave it to her when Eric was born. - When was that? - Six, seven years ago now. I remember when she brought the baby home from the hospital. I mean, from the airport. I told her, you don't go flying around at Christmas as big as a house. But she went anyway. Some nonsense about it being her last shot at freedom. And sure enough, in the middle of nowhere, she goes into labor and has the baby. Can you remember where in the middle of nowhere was? Somewhere out west. Colorado, Utah, New Mexico. Such a lovely boy. I know you're married, but maybe we could have an affair. Jesse, it's her. She had a baby boy in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on December 28, 2000. His birth certificate said she named him Eric. His death certificate said he lived less than a day. She put Adam's wristband on her baby's body. What do we do? We've got to be careful. The media gets a hold of this, they'll see to it that the world knows before Elizabeth does. To me, that's backwards. - Jesse! - She's not going anywhere, Rose. I need you to trust me on this. I gotta go. I need some help. A Paradise town councilman called. Some guy named Hansen. He asked for my report. - Did you give it to him? - No. He also wanted to know if you've been using their cruiser on your trips to Boston. I don't have a car anymore. They know that. You're on thin ice, Jesse. They're building a case against you. How do you know? I'm Internal Affairs. It's what I do. - He did it. - Leave him alone. I know how you work. You set people up. You gonna take him in an alley and shoot him? Look, legally we can't touch him. I don't operate under the same constraints. I got a friend in the hospital pissing blood. You cross the line, I'll put you away. State Homicide, I need a car. - Marked or unmarked? - Unmarked. - Did you park in front? - Yes. Can we go some place where it's dry? - No. Talk to me for a while. - Why? I need you not to ask any questions. - Why? - That's a question. - I want you to have plausible deniability. - Why? - I can't tell you. - Why? Because if I tell you, you can't plausibly deny knowing it. - But you know it. - Yes. Don't look around. Do you have the two keys? - Yes. - Give me one. Now shake my hand. - Okay, go to 3A and use the key. - Where'd you get it? - From a saxophone teacher. - Will the saxophone teacher explain? - No, she's not there. - Because? Because I don't want her to be. Turn on the lights and leave. Go out the front door, get in your car and go home. - That's it. - That's it. You don't want me to stay for backup? I want you to give me your word you'll do as I asked, Suitcase. You'll explain to me one day, won't you, Lou? Yes, I will, Luther. Oh, you have any quarters? Thanks. 911 Emergency. There's a guy breaking into my building. He's got a gun. 407 Arthur. - Help me, please. - Please stay on the... Hello, Jesse. I've been expecting you. Rose, did you find that green Dodge? - How long have you known? - Not long. Why didn't you run? Come in, I want to show you something. I don't expect you to understand. I devoted my whole life to Eric. I left it just the way it was the day he died. You don't know, do you? "In front of a hundred helpless locals skating on Lake Webb last weekend, "a 5-year-old vacationing tourist fell through a weak spot in the ice and died. "Eric Morton's mother, Stephanie, "suffered from extreme hypothermia and abrasions "when she jumped in trying to save him. 'lt was a horrible, tragic accident, ' "Fire Chief Ned Williams said in a hastily arranged press conference. "'Any death of a child..."' It was an accident. She sent that letter the day after he died. "Your child is loved." They were here, hiding in plain sight. You can only do what you can do, Jesse. It happened on my watch. You got a registered letter. I signed for it. - It's from the Town Council. - Read it. Read it out loud. "This is to officially inform you "that you are suspended without pay "pending an official review." Could you return these to Captain Healy? What did you get Teddy Leaf on? Probably breaking and entering, concealed carry, parole violations. Enough. They want the keys to your cruiser. I guess you two will have to arrest her. I'd consider it a personal favor if you could wait a while. How long is a while? Until I call you. She's not going anywhere. Subtitles by LeapinLar
