Okay. Yep. That's nice. Wind machine? Give me more. Yes. Yes. That's it. Uh... More dirt on the chest, please. Perfect. Thank you. You ever read any of these romance novels? Honestly, not my thing, Josh. But apparently they sell because the ladies love your hot body. Now, come on! Pump up those pecs. Nice! Now gimme some attitude. I love it. There it is. You know, you should really read this one. It's pretty good. You read romance books? I gotta get into character. Come on. You're a total pro. Honestly, I'm just not the romantic type. Sure you are. You're always hoping romance is around the corner. We live in hope. Now. Come on. Gimme some more of that Viking pillage and plunder. I live to loot! Yes. Okay. Gimme the looting look again. Yes, there it is. Okay. Perfect. Oh. Okay. Get in there. All right. Ready? Big smiles. Perfect. Thank you. What's going on? The covers. They really do sell these books. There is nothing like a good Viking romance for summer reading. I never meet any guys like that. What? Your last two dates had long hair. Well, I don't think long hair necessarily means handsome, Sam. Just means they're not bald. I could never date a bald guy. Wait till you're over 50. He may be good looking. But is he boyfriend material? He's a little two dimensional. But I do love a man in uniform. Found Books. Tammy speaking. Yeah, she's here. Hello? Samantha Hill speaking. Samantha. It's Lauren Lawrence here. Oh, hello. Long time no speak. Yeah. I think the last time I saw you, you still had braces. Well, I'm all grown up now and running my own bookstore. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. My father and I are acting for the estate of the late Robert MacGraw. He had an extensive book collection. We'd like you to go and value it with a view to purchase. Sure. We can do that. We usually buy books by the yard. We sort them into colors and then we resell them. Content is irrelevant. Price depends on condition. And then we recycle the ones that we can't use. He had some great leather-bound books. Oh, those are even harder to sell. Except for people who want an instant antique library. We just want the place cleaned out. Well, we charge a fee for that, which we deduct from the value of the books. Fine. How soon can you get there? We're a little busy right now. But by the end of the week, for sure. When you get there park in the back. The lockbox code on the front door is 1234. Do you think you can remember that? I will try. Okay. Bye now. You never did like her. Did you? Nope. Since high school, we moved in different circles and I haven't had to deal with her, fortunately. But business is business. Well, Mr. MacGraw did buy a lotta books from us over the years. His library could be a real gold mine. Oh, let's hope. It's worth checking out. Just so you know, Mr. MacGraw was a very wealthy man and he was a pillar of our community, but he kept to himself. Beautiful old house. Wow! Wonder who'll inherit all of this. Not sure. I don't really know too much about the family. Hey, there's supposed to be a keypad around here somewhere. Ah. 1234. How original. I could live here. I'd for sure need a new wardrobe. Okay. I'm gonna get started. And I'll get the boxes. Perfect. Just make sure that you hit the home key lock button on your way back in. - Got it. - Thanks. Wow. Oh. Okay. 100 yards at say 30 bucks a yard. 3,000 bucks. What are we looking to offer? 1,000 to start. And if they want more, we'll settle for 1,500. But then we have to deduct our cleaning out rate fee. Perfect. Okay. So let's start sorting these books. Oh wow. There's a lot of old books here. There's some modern novels too. Some really nice coffee table books. Can make a few dollars on those. There's a lot of trashy paper backs. So we're probably just gonna recycle those ones. I like trashy paper backs. Of course you do. Go get 'em. There's dozens of them in good condition. Some are brand new. They might sell. It's summer. People love a hot, sexy, steamy, trashy romance. You're probably right. Okay. Let's start packing those too. Aw! A poesy of dried violets. How romantic! That is cute. Ooh. If we find any valuables, let's just put them on the side here. What's that? It's an old house. They make noises. Or the ghost just woke up. Ooh! I'm just joking. Well, hello, handsome. I think we've met before. He is dangerously good looking. He's not bad. Some of these covers too. This one's a few years old. The Viking must be at the modeling game for a really long time. Not exactly the sort of reading you'd expect for an old guy. Yeah. It is kinda weird, huh? Okay. It's okay. Let's go see what's- what's going on. Call the cops. 911, what's your emergency? Somebody has broken in and is in the house. MacGraw Mansion. Door code is 1234. We're dispatching somebody right now. Okay. Understood. Okay. Follow me. Let's try to find a back way. Okay. Sam! Sam! Come on. Yeah. Right. He saw us! I think he's right behind us. Let's get outta here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stand back. Freeze! Drop your weapon. It's a letter opener. Yeah, well. Drop it. He's a thief. I'm not a thief. Then who are you? And what do you want? Drop the, the, this... The fireplace poker? Yes, Ms. Hill, drop the poker. I was just about to ask Ms. Hill the same thing. Ask me what? I'll ask the questions. Who are you and what are you doing here? I'm here at the request of the estate lawyer to remove the library. Okay? Ms. Lawrence didn't mention that. Well, I thought you were thieves. Obviously we're not. That's why we called the police. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing here? I'll ask the questions! What are you doing here? I'm the owner. I thought the owner was dead. He was my grandfather. Good story. If it's true. Do you have any ID? I inherited the house. You hardly look the type to inherit the MacGraw Mansion. Mr. MacGraw was a wealthy man. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you were crawling through that window. I couldn't remember the code to the lockbox. And I'm looking for something. You forgot 1234? You can't remember 1234? Wait, the code was 1234? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is all confusing. You're confusing him. Look, you had to call the cops? She was right to call me, sir. Even if it is confusing. Please remove the glasses, sir. Okay. You check out. No more confusion. Mr. Joshua MacGraw. Satisfied? I'm sorry, Mr. MacGraw. There's a pill for that. If there's nothing else, folks, I'll be on my way. Okay. Thanks, Billy. Well, that was fun. If you'll excuse me, I have a lot to do. That was intense. Yeah. What a jerk. All right. Well, let's get this library packed up. I wonder what he's looking for. I hope it's a happy pill. Okay, Grandpa, where would you hide something so important? Hey, I was just gonna ask if you wanted to lock up? No, I'm leaving. Should I take a look at these in case I want a book? Well, you'll have to come to my bookstore since I've officially taken over the library. Once the books have been unpacked, racked, and stacked, anyone can buy them so... Right. Need a hand? No, I'm good. Okay. Have a good night, Ms. Hill. Have a good night, Ms. Hill. Thanks, Britt. It was a good day's work. Yeah. Except for Mr. Grumpy. Yeah, he was fun. Did he look familiar to you? Nope. And I hope to never see him again. He really scared me. The cops showed up. It was all okay in the end. It was just a little bit embarrassing. Ah, Billy. He probably really enjoyed it. Any chance to go clubbing. He the man. While you two were out playing cops and robbers, I read five books. Gee, Tammy. That's a lotta coloring. Well ha ha. One of them was on anti-gravity. Couldn't put it down. Found Books, Tammy speaking. Vikings everywhere. You know what? Let's put these on the summer reading display. The Viking dude sells books. He is hot. Sam, telephone. It's Mr. MacGraw. Tell him I'm not here. Okay. Understood. Thanks. Too late. He's on his way over to look at his books. His books? His books. Finders keepers? Not a chance. We have to give this to Mr. Grumpy? Give it to me. I'll put it in the cash register. Coffee money. Are you a fan of the romance? Yeah. You could say that. Yeah. Well, we have a lot of them. They're selling really well. Oh. Anyway. I'm sorry about the bad mood yesterday, ladies. It's fine. I suppose Vikings are allowed to be moody. No, it was just it was a long drive up from the city. And my lawyer mentioned that there was a letter that she couldn't find that was in my grandfather's will. So I thought I'd take a look. - And? - Ah, it was a waste of time. Didn't find a thing. I'm really sorry about calling the cop, Billy. That's fine. Just a little embarrassing. We all could have gotten arrested. - Or worse. - Okay. Just... I have your books in the back if you just wanna follow me. Yes please. Lead the way. That's the thief. You don't say! Yeah. I'm not really seeing much I want here. Well, I just unpacked a bunch of paperbacks with your face on them. Yeah. I can't believe that my grandfather collected these. Yeah. We wondered about that. Well, I guess I'll take 'em. I've never had a complete set myself. - How many are there? - Oh, I don't know. I've done dozens of these shoots. But some are English historical. Some are Western. Some are almost naughty. I know. They're kind of cheesy, but I guess my grandfather approved of my second career after all. What's your first, Mr. MacGraw? Call me Josh. Mr. MacGraw kinda makes me sound like my grandfather. I'm an architect. This whole modeling thing was just something I do on the side. Hm. So you're selling the house then? Yeah. That's the plan. I'm so busy in the city and it's kind of a far commute. Oh, I'll say. Anyway. I guess I better get to the lawyer. Oh, Lauren? Yeah. I haven't met her yet, but she seems nice on the phone. She's nice enough. - What? - Nothing. Do you want any other books? Can I help you with anything else? No, I think I'm good, thanks. I'm actually allergic to dust, so... Must be a problem when you're ransacking. These are all the ones in good condition and I've dusted you off of them. Dusted them off for you. Thank you. Bless you. Maybe he's not as bad as we thought. He's fine. Get back to work. Your grandfather owned quite a few properties around town. I had no idea who was so into real estate. Mm-hm. He owned some of these buildings. Any idea which ones? Not entirely. My father knows. He managed your grandfather's business affairs for years. I love these old main streets. The architectural detail. Oh, look. Like the decorative corners in the crown of this building. I think those are the original windows. That's beautiful. I love how passionate you are. About architecture? Oh yeah. These streets used to be the heart of their communities. It's kinda sad when they get hollowed out by development and big box stores coming in on the periphery. What are you gonna do with all your newly acquired real estate? I haven't not that far ahead. My architectural firm in the city keeps me very busy, but I love what I do. Josh, you're a man who knows what he wants. I like that. Yeah. I actually have a conference call with the office. But I'll see you at 1:00. Can't wait. - Hi. - Hey. Thank you. - Guess what? - What? I just saw the Viking with that lady lawyer. First off, Lauren Lawrence is no lady. And second, ask me if I care. Sam, that's no way to talk about an old school friend. She was no friend. Even if she was the last lawyer on this planet, I still wouldn't hire her. Wow. Harsh. Sam's folks had a run in with Lauren's father, Larry. They took him to court, something about this building. He wriggled out of it and they almost lost the bookstore trying to pay the court costs. Well, I was still in school then, so I don't really remember all the details. Too busy chasing boys? Oh, there was no point. Lauren had them all staring at her legs. Well, I kind of feel sorry for her. What? She's just as slimy me as her father. She had to do whatever Daddy told her. He groomed her. He sent her to the finest law schools and then set her up in his law practice as his partner. He's a control freak. I always thought it was funny that her dad was called Laurence Lawrence. It's a good thing he became a lawyer so that he can call his firm Lawrence Law. But then to call his daughter Lauren. I mean, Lauren Lawrence? Not much imagination. People call him Larry Two-Names. He always repeats himself. He always repeats himself. Well, I'm glad your grandparents didn't lose the store. Yeah, me too. If Tom Hill and Milly Dale hadn't gotten married, I wouldn't have all this today. If it wasn't for your hard work, this bookstore wouldn't have survived after your parents passed. Yeah. And maybe I'd be out there traveling the world and living a real life. Right? Oh, don't be so hard on yourself. This is the family biz and you kept it going with blood, sweat, and tears. Hill and Dale would be proud. Thanks, Tammy. Hey, time heals all wounds. That's such a cliche and it's not true. Time just covers up the scars. Okay. That's enough with this walk down memory lane. Let's get back to work, ladies. Thank you. So what's this Joshua MacGraw like? Well, he's good looking, passionate about his career, and very busy. I think I can keep him in line. Do you now? Do you now? Once he takes ownership of the estate, I'll convince him to leave the property management structure in place. I'm sure he'll be fine with the monthly rental checks and stay in the city. There's nothing here for him. I've been milking this cow for a long time and I am not ready to give up the management of the MacGraw properties. Bob MacGraw. Ah. Didn't care about the business as long as the money kept rolling in. Came in once a year and signed where I told him to. Oh, thank goodness for trusting clients. I wanted to talk to you about the missing letters of codicil. Are they gonna be a problem? No idea. They were mentioned in an amendment he made to the will, but Grandpa MacGraw never produced them. Probably nothing. It's just the ramblings of a senile old man. As long as you finish probating the will before they turn up, then it shouldn't be a problem. Meanwhile... Get him to change his mind about selling the mansion. That's my girl! That's my girl! Tammy, check this out. Oh! Aw, I remember some of those places from when I was a little girl. Not that it was that long ago. Of course, black and white. Just yesterday. Here's an interesting one. That. The MacGraw mansion. Look at all the staff they had. Pretty stiff and starched. Who's that standing in the middle there? That would be your grumpy Viking's great grandparents. He's not my grumpy Viking. And since we're buying his library, I guess that makes him a client. So a little bit more respect there please. Hm. He is cute. I'd say handsome. I didn't say I was interested. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Hmm. What? You need to believe in yourself. You have so many fine attributes, but you insist on living like a bookworm. This business occupies me 24/7. I don't have time for other things. You should make some. Here's Grandpa Tom and Grandma Milly in front of the bookstore. She was very pretty. Yeah, she was. She died the year before I was born so I don't really know too much about her. Back then, you had to be very wealthy to belong to the sailing club. I like their outfits. Beautiful clothes. Even the children are dressed to the hilt. And here they are having a picnic by the lake. Could you imagine an old Mr. MacGraw calling for an ice tea and then some maid hurrying over to do his bidding. That's a good idea. I'm gonna make some ice tea. Want some? No, I'm okay. I'm gonna go for an ice cream by the lake. I need a break. I'll settle for an ice tea. Thanks, Tammy. Ah, sorry about that. Client issue. They always want changes. Oh, yeah. It's the same in my practice. I forgot how nice it was here, down by the lake. My dad and I used to come visit my grandpa when I was a kid. But I haven't been here in a long, long time. I guess not since my dad passed away. Do you remember your grandfather? I had this picture of him and I standing in front of the mansion. I always kept it with me. And then standing at the property yesterday, it just brought back a lotta memories. Yeah. Speaking of the mansion. I think you should reconsider selling the mansion. The way the market is, I'd toss it in with the rest of your rental properties. Dealing with the renters could be a bit of a headache, don't you think? Agreed. I think you should leave it with the property management company. It's worked for your grandfather. Yeah. Yeah. Let me think about it. Oh. Oh dear. I probably should have told her. I heard you bumped into her at the mansion. Didn't go so well. Kinda feel like I should make it up to her. She's an odd duck. I wouldn't worry about it. She's gonna get money from your grandfather's library. I'm sure that's all she cares about anyway. You know, that's a good time to do whatever... Hey! What? I used to read these all the time. So there I am with an ice cream cone melting in my hand and Josh is having a meeting with Lauren. And then they started laughing at me. And now Billy's being all weird outside. I don't know what's going on. What? You look kinda cute with rocky road on your nose. Hm? Oh my God! Ain't that life? Just one rocky road. Yeah. I guess I should tell him about this. Yes. And you should give him the $100 bill too. That's our coffee money! Call him. I'll think about it. Come on. Phone him. Okay. I will. But only to keep you two quiet. Now go away. Hello? It's Sam. From the bookstore. I was just thinking about you. Why? So you could laugh at me some more? Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Well you could have said something. You're right. I should have. Look, hey, now that I got you on the phone, can I ask you something? Are there any good restaurants in town? Why don't you ask Lauren? I don't really like to mix business with personal. Well, there's an Italian place on Front Street. Great. Did you wanna maybe join me for an early dinner? What? I'm business. I mean, this call is business. Well, not really. You know, I'm just asking for a dinner recommendation. I called you. Yeah. Oh yeah. Was it about the books? Yes. Well, you see that's business with the estate. Not with you and me. How's 5:30 sound? Okay, fine. But I need to talk to you about some business. Dinner at 5:30. I'll see you there. Strictly business. What's that? I'm going for business. I mean, I'm going for dinner. - When? - 5:30. Wow. You better get ready. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I better get ready. - Yeah. - Okay. Oh- We'll lock the front door. Okay. Hello. Hi. Hi. So sorry I'm late. I had to go upstairs and change. Upstairs? Nevermind. I'm here. Well, I'm glad 'cause I was gonna drink that whole bottle by myself. I can mix business with pleasure. I'll help you. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mm! Okay. Some ground rules before we start. I'm only gonna stay if we split the check. - Really? - Yes, really. I do have business to discuss. Okay. But could we order first? Sure. Any recommendations? The eggplant Parmesan is really good. You a vegetarian? Trying. I don't eat red meat anymore. I think I'll have the same. Excellent selection. Thank you. - So... - So... Tell me about yourself. How did you get into the book business? I inherited the store from my parents after they passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I really miss them. How about a cheers? To your parents and the good memories. Thank you. - Agua? - Yes, please. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm a little bit nervous. Nervous? A hunk of a Viking like you? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's not me. Modeling is something I did just to pay my way through architectural school. But it's fun. You know, I like it. You get to make faces and get paid to play pretend so... Well, my whole bookstore is full of pretend so I completely understand pretend. You know, I think some people assume that models can just do one thing. But, you know, most of us have other careers and jobs. How did you get into architecture? I always loved drawing and building things. And when the modeling picked up, it took me to places like Italy and Paris, Greece. Man, seeing all that incredible architecture has just gotten me so fired up. That sounds so... Romantic? Yeah. I mean traveling the world, seeing things I've only ever seen in books. All that history, all that culture. Yeah. That sounds a little more interesting than Sylvan Lake. Well, if you could go anywhere, where would you go? I don't know. I've always wanted to go to Italy. Well then, pack your bags. Oh I think the eggplant Parmesan is as close as I'm gonna get. But it's okay. Excuse me. See, it's not where you are. It's who you're with. To our health. That's pretty good. Brava. I like pretend. So do I. Good. Okay. But I'm serious about this being a business dinner. - Okay? - If you insist. Here. There you go. Wines of the world. Well, that's gonna come in handy when we go to Paris. Just open it. A fake book! It was in your grandfather's library. So I just, I thought you should have it. Huh? Now we know the budget for dinner. Okay. $100 dinner it is, on your grandfather. And what is this? I thought it might be the key to something special. Any ideas? No, none. But he had it hidden in his library. Maybe it's a hidden passageway? Hidden treasure? Could be the key to the missing letter. Yeah. I like that. Okay. I'm gonna have to go check the house. More business. More? We bought the library as books by the yard. So it worked out to $1,000, less our service fee. Well, you are the expert. But we found some fabulous first editions, much more valuable. So I estimated their value and I wanted to split that with you. So here... You didn't have to do that. I know, but I want to. The check's made out to the estate so you're not gonna be able to spend it tonight. But I'm pretty sure you're gonna be pleased with the total. Dinner's on me. No arguments on that. Write it off as a business expense. Well, if Lauren will sign off on it. Lauren? You don't seem to like her much. Why? To put it bluntly, she just, she made my life hell when we were teenagers. That's all. And it still bothers you? No, it doesn't. We're certainly not friends. You know, she has been privileged all of her life and just takes what she wants. Well, she's not taking anything from me except for a standard probate. So. And her dad, Larry Lawrence, is even worse. My folks were in a lawsuit with him once. Nearly cost us our bookstore. So I just don't trust them. That's all. Well, thank you for the warning. Yeah. To my grandpa. To your nonno. What was he like? He was the kindest man imaginable. You think about your parents a lot? Every day. They left me the bookstore, which I love. But, you know, it was a lot to take on for a 19 year old. You've obviously done very well. I get by, but it's a lot of hard work. Keeping a good inventory, stocking the right books at the right time. Like the romance novels at this time of the year. The summer visitors just come in and lap them up. Yeah. I can see that. So what kinda books do you like? Oh, all of them. But I haven't read a lot of the romance novels, to be honest. What about you? Yeah. I've read a few. - Really? - Yeah. But it's research, right? You know, I have to get into character. Of course. Yeah. It's better with the wig and the whole thing. My parents made the children's section just for me. So after school, I spent all my time there. I was a real little bookworm. I just, I don't know. I love books. Yeah. I can see that. You know, my grandfather used to take me sailing on the lake. It was magical. It was like flying across the water. That's so nice. It was a nice night. Thanks for agreeing to come to dinner with me. Well, I thought since we got off to such a bad start, you know, give you the benefit of the doubt. And? There's more to you than meets the eye. I'm glad you feel that way. You, Joshua MacGraw, are a very interesting man. Pretty interesting yourself. First time I saw you standing there with the fire poker. You gimme a fire poker and I can take on anyone. I believe it. Well, you can take care of yourself. I like that. Well, I have an early start tomorrow. So I'm gonna go. It's getting late. Will you come over to mansion with me this weekend? Help me find a lock for that key? Of course. Thanks for dinner. And I'll see you Saturday. Arrevederci. A presto. Ah. Good afternoon, Mr. MacGraw! Larry Lawrence. It's an honor to meet you at last. Your grandfather spoke of you often. He did? Oh, yes, he did. Yes, he did. He was quite proud of your architectural exploits and your other enterprises. It's so nice to speak to such an important new client. Well, I don't know how important I am but- Oh, very important. Very important. You're gonna be one of the biggest property owners in town, Mr. MacGraw. Can I ask you a question? Fire away? Are you planning on moving back to Sylvan Lake? We have a property management company looking after your grandfather's interests. Would you like them to continue on? Daddy. Let's not rush things. Mr. MacGraw likes to take things slow. Ah, well then why don't you show Mr. MacGraw the territory? Sure. Come. Follow me. The art collection at Lawrence Law is one of our passions. It's very impressive. And so is our practice. Now, how was court today, Lauren? How was court? Excellent. We won, of course. I didn't think you're coming in today, Daddy. Oh, thought I might. Thought I might. Would be nice to have some new blood in town. I should put Mr. MacGraw for a local business club. Oh, please, call me Josh. Oh, and you call me Larry. Sure, Larry. I don't think Josh would be interested in joining your stuffy old club, Daddy. Well, when Mr. Josh sees just how much of the town he owns, he may wanna be part of the town's senior leadership. Well, there's a lotta decisions to be made before I decide on that. He's got a very good job in the city. In fact, I was just offered a promotion to partner. - Congratulations! - Thanks! Wonderful! Wonderful! You're a very busy man and you've inherited a big responsibility. Take a look. Now I handled the purchases of these properties myself, but in the intervening years, the property management company your grandfather hired has taken care of the details. See, I always thought my grandfather was in the mining business. He sold out years ago. Went into commercial real estate. Now, Lauren tells me you're putting the mansion on the market. Do you think that's a good idea? Well, I do like it. I think there's a lotta potential. It's just a lotta work to update. Perhaps the management company could handle it. - Yeah. I should talk them. - I can do that. Now, Lauren is handling the probate of the will, which I understand is very straightforward. Your grandfather made it very clear that everything goes to his favorite grandson. Clear, except for the mention of the letters of codicil. I asked one of my team to look in the archives, see if they might be there. Or maybe they've been misfiled. Well, that's assuming that your grandfather brought them in or that they even exist. Well, he put it in the will. So it must have been important to him. I remember him coming in and adding the amendment about the letters. I just don't think he ever followed through. I hate to tell you this, Josh, but the last few years, your grandfather, let's just say he was a little off. He had little contact with anyone and he seemed... Are you saying he was incompetent or... Oh, not at all. Not at all. Sharp as ever. Just a bit forgetful at times. Maybe he intended to write the letters and never got around to it. If they show up, we'll deal with it. In the meantime, let's just continue on the process. Not to worry. Not to worry. You're in good hands with Lauren. Oh, you know what? That reminds me. What? What? Lauren, you negotiated the deal for the Found Bookshop to sell all the books in the library. Yeah. The owner gave me this check last night. So. Last night? Samantha. Yeah. Yeah, we went to dinner. Just getting to know the local business leaders. So. Anyway, this turned up and I was wondering, do you guys have any idea what this is? Hmm. No idea. Drink? Drink? No, thank you. I wouldn't show that to anyone or we'll have a treasure hunt on our hands. What? If people think there's a buried treasure, they're gonna be digging up your grandfather's garden. You think there's buried treasure? Of course I don't. Of course I don't. I'm just saying what can happen when a silly rumor gets started, especially in a small town. Best keep it to yourself. Right. I am on a course all weekend. 18 holes a day, if you know what I mean. Fore! Just gimme a moment. I'm just gonna go freshen up. Sure. So Mr. MacGraw. It's Friday. Let's celebrate. What exactly are we celebrating? You came into a very nice inheritance, thanks to your grandfather. I'd rather have him than the inheritance. So. Of course. Yeah. There's a bar just around the corner. - I'll buy. - Oh no. I think I really am gonna have an early night. But thank you. No date with Samantha? It was a business dinner. If you see her again, as Daddy said, just don't mention anything about key. Not until we know what it opens. Well, Sam's the one who found the key. Tomorrow we're heading over to the property and we're gonna see if we can unlock the mystery. So to speak. Sounds like fun. I'll come help. I wouldn't bother. I honestly don't think we're gonna find anything. As your council, I would strongly caution against sharing the hunt with civilians. Well, we'll see. You know, how about we just go somewhere more comfortable to wrap up? I could use a drink. Sure. Why not? So do you miss the city? Not really. Actually, I'm kind of enjoying the break. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh. - Oh, you all right? These heels are awful. Yeah. I don't know how women wear them. They look so uncomfortable. We're slaves to fashion. I wear them 'cause people say I look like a model when I wear high heels. Do you think I could have modeled? I'm sure you could have. Coming from you, that's such a compliment. Seeing your work, you look good in everything. It's good genes, I guess. I bet you look good in jeans too. This us? This is it. - Oh. - Thanks. Thank you. Excuse me. But are you the guy on those Viking novels? No. Yes. Yes. That's him. I knew it was you. I mean, him. She's kidding. I'm an architect. A very handsome architect. Okay. Who's also a Viking. Okay. Now you're just embarrassing me. It's not every day a guy like you walks into my office. Or probably her bar. Okay, Mr. Viking, you've seen how much property you own. What do you think? I might take your dad's advice and just let the whole portfolio ride. As much as I'd love if you moved to Sylvan Lake, I get it. You've got a great career. Plus your modeling work. You know, I did always love it here when I was a kid, though. Hmm. It can wear thin after a while. You don't like it here? Sure. Business is good and summers are nice. But you don't seem happy. I'm fine. You know, I'll tell you what, if I need cheering up, I'll come visit you. Oh? - Cheers. - Yeah. To a successful day. It was a good day, wasn't it? It was. For the both of us. And now that you're a wealthy landowner, hopefully you'll let me continue handling your affairs. My affairs? Business affairs. Business. Yes. Unless... you had something else in mind. How long do you think it's gonna take to wrap up the probate on the estate? Not long. And the missing letters? They'll show up. We'll figure it out. All right. I'm hoping that this is gonna turn into a long and profitable relationship. Yeah. Well, we'll see. Let's let loose. Get to know each other. Okay. What would you like to know? For starters, do you often get recognized? Yeah. Sometimes. You know, I try not to make a big deal of it. What does your partner think? Oh, yeah. No girlfriend, no partner. Hmm. Really? I find that hard to believe. An attractive man like you. Yeah. Well, you know, I'm very busy with work and, you know, traveling for modeling. It's not a lotta time to date. Is there somebody special in your life? There was someone once, but, yeah, it's all over now. What happened? I'd say it was more lust than love. What's wrong with lust? Hello? Morning. Just wanted to see how you're feeling this morning. Oh, I'm fine. I think. To be honest, I don't remember much. What happened? Oh, you were very drunk. And a little too forward. Oh. I did take your keys. Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. Speaking of keys, I just wanted to remind you not to do anything impulsive with that old key. Right? Uh huh. I hope I can see you later. Yeah. I'll have to see how I feel. I'll see you at the office. Promise? Yeah. Promise. Bye. Oh! Oh no! Hello? Good morning. Ah. Yeah. That's debatable. What? What happened? Apparently I painted the town red last night. Oh dear. Good company, I hope. Meeting with my lawyer. Oh. Lauren? Yeah. But it was just a business meeting. With a few too many celebratory drinks. Where are you now? The Anchor Inn. Look, I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to go to the house today. Let's do it another time. Oh, well, I've made a picnic lunch. Well... And I've got some ideas about the key. Really? Amazing. So I've been looking through one of your grandfather's old books about the town. There's pictures of the mansion and some of your ancestors. I'd really love to see that. Do you remember an old ice house? No, but I do remember there was a big fridge in the kitchen. I used to sneak a slice of the chef's apple pie every night before bead. It was so good. Okay. So it might be a wild goose chase, but we could look for the ice house. Or maybe any storage room or maybe the basement. Sounds like you have a plan. Oh, I do. Aren't you excited? Absolutely. Could you maybe gimme an hour? Well, I will pick you up and I will bring coffee and water. Sounds good. Come on. Let's go find that hidden treasure. Just gonna finish my coffee here first. Let's go. Mm-hm. Coming. How do you have so much energy? Come on. Take a seat. Mm. Sitting sounds good. Okay. Why don't you look at these family photos and I'm gonna go find the ice house. Okay? Sounds good. Now we're getting to work. Yes ma'am. He is your iced tea, Mr. MacGraw. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I must have been dreaming. You were in a maid outfit. No maid. Thank you. Oh, did you find any of the hidden treasure? No ice house. There's an old garage, but the door is locked. You know, it's funny. Looking at these photos, it reminds me of when I was here as a kid. People really knew how to enjoy themselves. Man, this is quite the spread. Thank you. Mm. I'm gonna miss this place. It's beautiful. It's got so much potential. As what? I was thinking maybe a boutique hotel. Hmm. The lawyers don't want me to sell. Why? They want me to throw it in with the rest of the rental properties. I don't wanna overstep, but I don't really know if I would trust them. Yeah. Maybe not. Though it probably would take a lot to get it up to code. Yeah, but it'd be worth it. Yeah, if I was here. Well, why wouldn't you? I've been offered a promotion from the firm. - Congratulations! - Thanks. And apparently I own a bunch of buildings downtown too. It's funny, I've been thinking maybe I could start my own business here. But it is a small town. How do you make it work? Well, I have to get pretty creative sometimes. You know, with eBooks and online book sales and all these big box stores. It's tough. You know, people still like to browse and there's nothing like holding a real book in your hands, right? So. It always helps to like have a clever title or an attractive cover, like your latest Viking book. Hey, I didn't write it. I'm just on the cover so... I've actually been thinking about getting outta modeling. I wanna focus on other things in my life. Sorry, we were talking about the bookshop and now we're suddenly talking about me again. It's okay. I'll let it slide just this one time. You know, truth is, I've been finding this a little overwhelming. Losing my grandfather and inheriting the estate. It's not easy. You have a lot of big decisions to make. How did you manage? Well, Tammy worked for my parents, so she helped me learn the ropes. And I just put my head down and kept going. I really admire you. Thank you. Yeah, it hasn't been easy. The rent on the building keeps going up and I had to sell our house and move into the room above the bookstore. Really? It's not all that bad. I actually really love the space. It's all like old post and beam. Nice. You know a good architect could probably turn it into something really special. Yeah, I think I could recommend one. Yeah. You know, our little town has a lot to offer. I'm starting to see that. - Okay. - Thank you. So, next. - Check the storage room? - Sure. Good. There used to be a lotta spiders down there. - Seriously? - Oh yeah. Huge ones. But you're not afraid, are you? No. Of course not. Oh good. All right. Lead the way. - Okay. - All right. What do we got here? I've already checked the cabinets and the drawers. Oh, what about fake walls? Panels? Now you're talking. I'll start on this side. Okay, I'll start here. One more sweep of the kitchen? Yep. Ah, our finest selection. Dessert, ma'am? How lovely. Just a small one, please. Thank you. Oh, no calories. Perfect. Onward? These are all built with locally quarried sandstone. That's cool. Okay. So we're making progress. Uh-huh. They used to host all kinds of soirees and formal events here. Oh, what do we got? Pleased to meet your acquaintance, Mr. MacGraw. The pleasure's all mine, madam. Welcome to the mystery mansion. I heard there's a hidden treasure. This key is... The key to... Untold fortune. Or perhaps... Absolutely nothing. Or maybe... Key to someone's heart. You're such a romantic. Shall we dance? I haven't this much fun in a long time. I bet you say that to all your wenches. I'm gonna get an ice tea. This key has to fit something. We have to keep looking. It's a big mansion. It could be anywhere. Maybe not anywhere. What is it? I have an idea. What is it? One sec. Josh! Okay. We're looking for a key to the shed. Mm-hm. Oh! One of these has to be the key. - I'll take 'em all. - Let's go. - No. - Try these ones. All right. - Yes! - Yes! Lotta memories here. This isn't it. What is it? It's a mystery wrapped in canvas. I think... My grandfather's sailboat. Wow. It's beautiful. He loved this boat. Check this out. Hey, I remember that heart. What do you mean? We pillage the boat. Treasure's gotta be here somewhere. Come on. Okay. You do the honors. Really? Yeah. It fits, but it doesn't turn. Wait, I have an idea. Okay. Try this. Oh. The oil'll take a little time to work. Drink while we wait? - Sure. - Okay. Cheers. We don't even know what's in it yet. We will soon. To sailing and strong winds. Hi, guys. Josh. Samantha. What are you doing? I think we found what we were looking for. We just can't get it open. I knew you wouldn't take my advice about keeping the key a secret. Well, I wouldn't have found it without Sam. So. You know, as executor of the estate, I'll take care of this. I'll get a certified locksmith to open it and then we can review the contents at my office. Okay. Had a lotta fun last night. Here are your car keys. Later, Josh. Yeah, I think I'm just gonna go. Sam! Wait! So Josh and I, we went to the MacGraw mansion and we had a picnic. That's good. Yeah. You know, and we had a lotta fun looking for the mystery key box. And then we found a box in his grandfather's sailboat. The key fit. That's really good. Then Lauren shows up. - Not so good. - She ruined everything. You know, I thought Josh and I had something going. And then she took the box because she's in charge of the estate. And I just, I don't know. I just don't trust her. But Josh seems to think she's okay. I mean, maybe more than okay. Well, hey, there's always another book on the shelf. Tammy. I hope it's not me that gets left on the shelf. I mean, what am I gonna do? I thought I found a good man. Someone I'm actually interested in. Give it time, Sam. I'm sure he'll come round. She's a very shallow person. He'll figure it out. You think so? I have no idea. But I do know that if two people are meant to be together, they will be. The course of true love never did run smooth. Shakespeare. "A Midsummer Night's Dream." You got it. Now it's time to open. We have customers coming and books to sell. Yeah. You're right. Found Books. Samantha Hill speaking. Sam. It's Josh. Look, I'm in the city for business, but I just wanted to call and explain what happened between Lauren and I that night. Okay. So what did happen, Josh? I know what Lauren implied. And, yes, I'd had too much to drink, but nothing happened. I swear. I don't know if I believe you. Sam, I'm telling you the truth. You can do whatever you like with whomever you like. I don't care. You don't care? Look, I have customers right now. I just, I don't have time for this. I'm sorry. I have to go. - Bye. - Sam... Hello, Lauren Lawrence here. Lauren. It's Josh. Josh. Nice to hear your voice. Daddy was relieved you found the mystery box. Oh good. What was inside? You'll have to come here and find out. It's a surprise. Well, I'll be back in a few days and I'd really like to get all this estate business wrapped up ASAP. I like it when you tell me what to do. I just wanna get on with things. I thought we might grab dinner to celebrate. You know, I think it'd be better if we just met at your office and go from there. Oh? And I'd also like it if your father could be there as well. All right. Of course. Oops. Ah! These darn Vikings. I think the publisher is really gonna like these ones. - Great Viking! - Yeah. Well I'm glad it turned out because I think it's my last. What? What's going on, Josh? I think I'm done with modeling. I mean, it can wear on you after a while. Is it about the promotion? Just think it's time for change. A certain someone perhaps? Yeah. Something like that. I'm gonna miss you. You were everyone's favorite Viking. Not to mention cowboy, warrior, hunter. I'm gonna miss you too. And I'm really gonna miss all the cool costumes and makeup, but don't you go telling anyone, okay? Our secret. So what are you gonna do about that certain someone? Last time we spoke, she hung up on me. - So... - Well, that's not good. Have you thought about flowers? It always worked on me. Right. Hey, no regrets. It was great while it lasted. But honestly, Josh, I'm just too into my career. Whoever she is, she must be someone special. Yeah, she is. Why are books so afraid of their sequel? Why? Because they always come after them. These just arrived. Cool. Does it say who they're from? As if we couldn't guess. "For my key friend, something to unlock your heart. The Viking." So romantic. Oh, please. That gives me an idea. I wonder if the Viking would do a promo appearance here. You know, in full Viking stuff. Oh, that is a great idea. I mean, the cutout's good, but Josh himself would really bring the customers in. Hmm. It's worth a try, I guess. I think you just wanna see more of his chest. Nah. This is just business. Here's Josh. You're in trouble, little missy. Trouble with what? Nothing. You know, I was just thinking about you. That's nice. I just got the roses. They're lovely. Thank you. Well, it's the least I could do. Can I ask you something? Would you mind coming to the store and being a Viking? Why? Just to help with publicity. I mean, if you'd prefer, I can liaise through your publisher's PR department. I just, I thought it'd be easier if I called you. Well, as of today, I kinda quit the Viking business altogether. Really? What do you mean? I'll be back in Sylvan tomorrow. I'll explain everything. Okay? Okay. Arrevederci! A presto. What are you two looking at? Hm? How was the drive last night? Long, as usual. Hopefully this won't take long and then we can celebrate. Good morning. Good morning. Has Lauren showed you the big surprise? No, I just arrived. Take a look. What is this? Your grandfather got his start during the local gold rush. I had no idea. What is all this? Oh, some old newspaper clippings about your grandfather winning a local sailing club race. You could have them framed. It would make a nice little memory pic. And that's it, huh? Mystery solved. Mystery solved. What are you doing? The missing letter. Three letters. Three letters. We can count, Daddy. Dear, Joshua. I'm glad you followed the trail and found the box. Larry Lawrence made me a lotta money, but I never really trusted him. Watch your back. Always. Love and respect, your grandfather. What's it say? What's it say? Just a private message from my grandfather. Huh? More mystery. More mystery. That looks like a young Robert MacGraw. I don't know who the young woman is. Huh. Dear, Robert. I very much regret that I cannot marry you. I know this is not the answer you wanted to hear, but I have fallen in love with Tom Hill. I will always hold you in the utmost affection. With loving friendship, Milly Dale. This is about Tom Hill and Milly Dale. The original proprietors of Found Books? Sam's grandparents? "Private. Only to be opened after my death. Robert MacGraw." My beloved Milly would not accept my proposal of marriage, but we remained loving friends our whole lives. As a token of that love, I leave her granddaughter, Samantha Hill... What does it say? A holographic codicil. How unusual! How unusual! Is it legal? Oh, yes. Yes. Unless you, as the sole heir, decide to contest it. No. Oh. What's in the envelope? What a surprise. Josh, this is such a romantic story. I mean, when I said we had a surprise for you, I didn't expect it to be this. I'm so excited for us. Us? All of us. All of us. Now that the missing letter has shown itself, the execution of the will should go quite quickly. You can get back to your architectural work and the rental property checks will start rolling in. Time to celebrate, Mr. MacGraw. You know, actually, speaking of the rental properties, how do I get in contact with the management company? Oh, let me take care of that. Like you did for my grandfather? Worked for him. Worked for him. What's the name of the company, Larry? Josh, let Daddy handle it. Let's get a drink. Yeah. The name of the company is Sylvan Properties LLC. What of it? Well, I did some checking and the owner is Laurence Lawrence. Perfectly legal. Perfectly legal. Well, except when you consider the fact that, over the last 20 years, all the checks you've paid to my grandfather, well, they haven't increased. While rental fees have almost doubled. Your grandfather didn't care. Well, I do. I think you're greedy and I don't trust you. Perfectly legal. - Perfectly. - We'll let the courts decide. I had an accountant look through all of my grandfather's records. I'll be suing Sylvan Properties LLC for fraud. And effective immediately, I'm terminating my relationship with Lawrence Law. Josh, please. There must be something I can do to smooth this over. Like father, like daughter. No, I'm not like him. What? What? You're greedy. My own daughter! You manipulate and dominate to get what you want. You're a bully and I am tired of trying to be like you. Josh, please. Please, please forgive me. I had no idea what he was doing. Liar! You knew I was skimming the profits off old man MacGraw. You sat there and plotted how you'd help me do it to Josh. Please. I can be different. That's not me. Nice try, Lauren. But I think I have everything I need. I'll see you in court. I'll see you in court. In court! In court! Hi. Hi. So I have a lot to tell you. Okay, what's going on? Don't worry. It's good news. Okay. For starters, I've decided I'm gonna move back to Sylvan Lake permanently. What about your promotion? I turned it down. I'm leaving the firm. I mean, that's great news. To have you here in town, it's... Yeah. I actually think your talents would be really good for our community. So it turns out that you were right. Lauren was only interested in me because of the estate. You should have seen her eyes light up when she saw the gold. Yeah, it turns out my grandfather didn't just leave me property. That's amazing. And there's more. There were three letters in the box, hidden under a false bottom. A false bottom? This is sounding like something out of a romance novel. So I did a little sleuthing and I found out that Larry has been skimming money off my grandfather's properties for years. Well, him and Lauren. So I'll be seeing them in court. Good. The second letter is from Milly Dale, your grandmother, to my grandfather. That's my Grandma Milly. And that's my Grandpa Robert. Emily. Milly is short for Emily. Your grandfather named his boat after my grandmother. That's so romantic. And now the best for last. Okay. My beloved Milly would not accept my proposal of marriage. But we remained loving friends our whole lives. As a token of that love, I leave her granddaughter, Samantha Hill, the property where Hill and Dale's Found Books & Shop stands. And the enclosed as a lasting memento of a love that might have been. Robert MacGraw. The bookshop is yours. I can't believe this. Sam, you deserve it. What did that last line mean? That's a surprise. That is all we've got left. Hi. Help yourself. Okay, sure. You're really good at this warrior thing. Viking. Whatever. Pump those pecs. He's amazing. I was wrong. Very wrong. Whatever he's got, we need to bottle it. Oh, I'm trying. Get in it here. I want a picture. Okay. How's my big, bad Viking doing? Just another day of pillaging and plundering. It's for a good cause. Yeah, but if one more little old lady pinches my butt. - Oh my. - I know. Not as innocent as they look. So what do you think? I like it. - Yeah? - Yeah. But I prefer the real you. Good. Smile, you two! Okay. I'm gonna let you get back to your Viking duties. Right. And I'll see you later? Absolutely. Okay, go. Such a beautiful night. Oh, I almost forgot. Are you proposing? It's a bit early for that, don't you think? I'm just showing it to you. This is the engagement ring that my grandfather gave to Milly. It was in the letter about the bookshop. "And the enclosed as a lasting memento of a love that might have been." This is a lot to take in. Don't worry.
