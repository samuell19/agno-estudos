[ALL CHUCKLING] All right. It's now or never. Smile for the generations to come. One, two... Hold on! We're coming. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Anda, Marcus, come on. Hurry up. [CHUCKLING] Three. ZEV: The Europe we have left behind is a cursed and corrupted place. For centuries, our Jewish brothers have been hunted down and butchered like animals. The sound of their cries reaches up to the heavens. But there is no reply. God is dead. We can wait for him no longer. We shall take fate into our own hands and create ourselves anew, in our lost and forgotten homeland. My hand trembles as I write these words, gazing out into our valley. Words that fill the first blank page of our communal diary. Here we shall record our triumphs, our sorrows, out most intimate thoughts. The dream of our commune springs to life, a society of free and equal human beings, who share material and spiritual goods as one. A new kind of society, that words cannot describe. Because nothing like it before has ever been created by man. [HOOVES BEATING] My gaze returns again to the valley below that bears the promise of justice to be served. -[ACCORDION PLAYING] -A people without a land returning to a land without a people. Only, this time, our genesis begins without God. Zev, August 8th, 1919. [WHOOPING] [ALL CHEERING] [WHISTLING] [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [WHISTLING] -Don't you dance? -Uh, no. Come on, I can teach you. No! [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] I'm sorry. [CHEERING] [WHISTLING] [HORSE WHINNYING] [ALL CHEERING] HALPERN: Well, well! You finally got here! You came alone? Where are the other watchmen? In the meantime I'm all you've got. -They giving you trouble? -[ALL CHEERING] [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] They're going down alone to talk to the sheik. Just like that. Easy, Halpern, that's why I'm here. One word of Arabic they don't know, and they're already running to talk. WOMAN: One, two, three, go. [CHEERING] [WHISTLING] [MUSIC STOPS PLAYING] How do you do? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Hello. Amnon. Hello. Hello. Amnon. I was sent out here to join you. Here you don't join. You get accepted. ANDA: Our life in Europe was a false illusion. The illusion of being able to change our despicable yet inevitable fate. Here, on this land, out of our desire for freedom, equality and justice, we are being born anew. Yulek, Marcus... Zev, Daniel. All my beloved friends. Our commune. A dream turning into reality. Anda, August 10th, 1919. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] [LAUGHING] [CONTINUES SPEAKING] [BOTH SPEAKING ARABIC] Ooh. [CONTINUES SPEAKING ARABIC] [MAN LAUGHING] -[GUNSHOTS] -[GUN COCKS] [GUN COCKING] AMNON: Take the bullet out of the chamber. Before you start a bloodbath. [VIOLIN PLAYING] [VIOLIN CONTINUES PLAYING] ANDA: Last time you played Tchaikovsky for me was on my graduation. At medical school in Vienna. I was all dressed up in my gown, and ready for the ceremony. Then I told you I wouldn't go. I wouldn't stand there and be honored by the bourgeois establishment. You smiled. You kissed me. And played for me. Only for me. Anda, August 22, 1919. DANIEL: Avrum, take this one. -Ingale. -Yes? You take the old Gulliver. I was saving it for you. You're the only one here who can lift it. [MAN SINGING] [WOMAN CHUCKLING] It's all right, I took it. -DANIEL: Natan. -Yes? Ugh. Can you handle this one? Yes. Marcus. DANIEL: Marcus, you take the little Mauser. Trigger's stiff, but it fires good. If you want, there's a Parabellum. [WOMAN CHUCKLING] This show of arms seems pointless to me. DANIEL: Well, how do you want to defend the plow? With your violin? There's too much at stake to act rashly! First, we should try to reach an agreement with the Arabs. What agreement? This land is ours. We paid for every inch of it! Yes! But not for the people on it! MARCUS: They're been living there for years, we should talk to them. We went there. We tried speaking to them. AMNON: And you almost got yourselves killed. There's not much you can talk about when you don't talk the same language. We don't need a language for what we came to say. Yeah, because you do all your talking with a gun! DANIEL: Look, you're not gonna make me a monster. Just because I insist on getting what is rightfully mine. Calm down, Daniel. Day and night, we sit here talking about creating a just and equal society. But here's our first real test. And we have failed. We are justifying injustice. [INHALES] Seems to me inhuman, immoral even, to ask a man who has nothing to give up on the little he needs to survive. Yeah, I'm the one who taught Yunija. So what? Can't I use him? You hated him. I changed my mind. Well, now he suits you, huh? It's relevant! Well, if relevance's the test, then what about Pearce? The moral choice is the most efficacious one. There's no room for philosophical debates here. Going down to work our fields is not just a matter of principle. It's a question of survival. Go down there tomorrow, and I promise you, things are going to get a lot worse. MAN: Who asked you? AMNON: You don't have to ask me. -Just going to happen. -But it's our land! We hold the deed. All you've got is a piece of paper. That means nothing to them. Nothing! The Arabs where here when we got here 16 years ago. We were seven families. Twenty-two men, women, and children. I remember, when we would come back from the fields at dusk, and start up the hill. You could hear the shouts of the children playing in the yard. Four years later, I was the only one left! You don't understand! There is no other way but to talk to them. With God's help, if he can do it, let him go to them! ZEV: We don't need outsiders to explain our own problems to us. The situation is very clear. This space belongs to us and to them. Our being here only stirs their hatred. Because on every piece of land where a Jew builds his home no Arab house will ever rise. [MUHAMED SINGING IN ARABIC] [STOPS SINGING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] YULEK: Yee-haw! [CHAINS JINGLING] [YELLING] -Yeah! -Oh. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [BOTH CHUCKLING] Yeah! [BOTH CHEERING] -Yeah! -[ALL CHEERING] -Yeah! -[ALL LAUGHING] Yeah! Yeah! MAN: Whoo! Yulek! MAN: [ECHOING] Yulek! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! [BOTH LAUGHING] MAN: Yulek! [LAUGHING] Whoo-hoo! [LAUGHING] Whoo! Yulek! Whoo-hoo! Yulek! [YELLING] [MAN SHOUTING] [LAUGHING] Whoo! [MEN LAUGHING] We're under attack! Yulek! Yulek, run for it! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] What about Whitey? You want to get yourself killed? [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [GUN COCKING] Come on! [PANTING] Run over to Zev, Daniel. Tell them the stockade is also under attack! Now! Run! [GUNSHOTS] [GROANING] Are you all right? The stockade's under attack. ZEV: Avrum! Avrum will carry you out. [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] ZEV: Daniel! Daniel, we got to get out of here! We've got to go! Now! Do you hear me? We have to retreat. Can you hear me? We have to retreat! Daniel! Daniel. What the hell are you doing? We're the only one left down here. Where is everyone? [GROANS] [GUN COCKS] -[GUNSHOTS] -[GROANING] [GUN COCKS] [GROANING] [QUIVERING] Shh. Almost have it. [EXHALES] [GROANING] [EXHALES] [EXHALES] You're lucky the bullet didn't fracture the bone. [EXHALES SHARPLY] It's all over. I'm lucky I got hit. It's the only chance I'll ever to be alone with you. In our happy little open society. You know that I prefer you healthy and well. Prefer? Or desire? We've been through this already. [EXHALES] We made a decision. -Yes, but we didn't take vows of celibacy. -[BREATHING HEAVILY] That's true. But it does mean reconsidering things. [MEN SINGING] [BLEATING] [CONTINUE SINGING] [HORSE WHINNYING] What's wrong? -[WHINNYING] -Whitey. -Come! -[SNORTS] [MEN SINGING] -Come on. Whitey, please, come on. -[WHINNYING] Amnon. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [HORSE SNORTS] [CONTINUES SPEAKING ARABIC] [MEN SINGING] [GUNSHOT FIRES] He's insane! Insane! I could have killed him! Suddenly, he comes right out of the ground! Are you crazy? I could have killed you. What're you smiling about? He almost killed you. Killed me? First of all, you've got to know how to shoot. Of course, that might not seem really important to a man with dreams as big as yours. But sometimes the little things can be damned important. Oh, uh... You forgot this out there. AMNON: I'm not finished yet. Where the hell are you going? Any chance, any chance I ever had of making peace with them, -you buried up under that plow. -Get your hands off of him. You understand? You understand? Answer me! God damn you! [GROANS] Zev, come on, get up. Come on. I'm sorry. Just trying to help. We don't need your help. [EXHALES] I made a mistake today. But we have to face facts. Without the valley plot, it's going to be very difficult to survive here. -Maybe even impossible. -[EXHALES DEEPLY] Maybe... ZEV: Maybe what? Maybe this. It grows on the south ridge. There's soil there. Beneath the stones. Not good soil, lean soil. But soil. We have to clean it up. Take out the rocks. It should be good enough for vegetables. Or olives. But, not for oranges. It's very hard work. Very hard. [GRUNTS] [CLANKING] [BLEATING] [GROANING] WOMAN: My friends, the food is getting cold. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Anda. [PRAYING] Rosa, Rosa. You must try. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] [ZEV GRUNTING] [WOMEN LAUGHING] -Give me some of those. -Where? Those two lunatics are still at it. [BREATHING HEAVILY] -The food is getting cold. -[BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANS] Open your hands. Show me. -[BREATHING HEAVILY] -AMNON: Shit. ANDA: Sit. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [TEARING CLOTH] [SOFTLY] Here. Let me see. You just can't do it like this. Do what? Change. Not like this. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [BELL TOLLING] -Last call. -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] All possessions must be turned into the communal store. [MAN LAUGHING] WOMAN: Look at this. [LAUGHS] MAN: You two ladies there, come out. -Rosa, over here. -Come on, Rosa. [MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Esther. There you are. All possessions must be turned in... Now why did you drop the guts... [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] MAN: You need some help with the window? That's my sister, Dweyala. She raised us. Me and my two other sisters. My mother died when I was three. Father was chief Rabbi of our town. And I... They said I was a prodigy. A born scholar. Like him. I was expected to take his place one day. Last time I saw them, their bodies were hanging from meat hooks in the town slaughterhouse beneath the sign "Kosher meat". My father's head was cut off. I found it outside in the courtyard. Where some Cossack must have kicked it. [VIOLIN PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What about the tallis? Don't you want to keep it with you? He said everything goes into the communal store. Come on, Sima. It's not a firing squad. Yulek. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BLEATING] [CHATTERING CONTINUES] I'll keep this with me. It's been in our family for generations. But we decided. Everything is to be turned over to the communal store. Sima, you forgot your suitcase. My suitcase? SIMA: I can do without everything. Almost everything. I cannot do without my love for Zev. Sima, -September 2nd, 1919. -[VIOLIN PLAYING] [SINGING IN ARABIC] [MARCUS SIGHS] All right, tell me what the words mean. Oh, dear Leila, come back, my love. -Come back, my love. -Yeah. All right, I'll try. [SINGING IN ARABIC] -What's that? -Huh? -Pizzicato. -Pizzi-what? -Pizzicato. -Oh. [SINGING IN ARABIC] -Right, we try one more time. -Okay. [SINGING IN ARABIC] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [STOPS SINGING] Anda. Listen. [SINGING IN ARABIC] I just came by to take the books. MARCUS: What books? You're the only one who hasn't turned us into the library. MARCUS: What are you doing? Anyone who wants to find my books can find them right here. Do you realize what will happen if everyone insists on keeping his own personal property? No. What? It will destroy the collective spirit. You can say this to heartbreak of yesterday, when some foolish peasant girl... It will be the end of our commune. ...makes curtains out of a priceless heirloom. Sima insisted on giving up the press. Insisted? She never had a choice. MARCUS: Neither do we! Not anymore. We're slaves to guilt. We have to talk about this now. Why, is he bothering you? Huh? His skin a little too dark for you. -That has nothing to do with this. -Yes, it does. I heard you talking about him at the meeting. About his being unsuitable to the communal spirit! Eh, how did Zev put it? Hey. Oh, no, you sit down. You sit down. You're not... You're not going anywhere. ANDA: Fine. I'm not embarrassed to say it. It is important to fit in here. Anda, in Europe we talked about an open society. Remember? About building an egalitarian social order. We got order, all right. The only thing we're building are walls to keep the foreigners out. So why do you stay if the things are so bad? Leaving is impossible. We're building a community that doesn't know how to forgive. Here everyone will be his own judge, jury and executioner. And believe me, they will be least forgiving of themselves. -Anda. -Don't! -You're making a mistake. -It will destroy everything. If you can't love one person, how can you open your heart to the whole community? -You love me. -No! [INHALES] It will tear apart the whole group. -You're preaching. -I am not! You wanted my books, didn't you? Don't you want these for your communal library? Huh? Do as you like. Yeah, as I like. Huh? Won't you take my thoughts as well? Or the music I haven't written yet! You do what you think is right. What I think is right. Here! Take that for your communal orchestra. [EXHALING] No! [GRUNTING] -Leave it! -No! MARCUS: Leave it! Leave it! [CLATTERING] [BELL TOLLING] Everybody's waiting. They won't start without you. You have to get up. What do you think Zev wants to talk about? I made an entry in the diary. I'll try it, anyway. Do you remember, how we spoke about it? We said our commune was going to be more than just a place to ration out clothes and potatoes. Take a look at the diary, Anda. It's a shopping list. Of declarations, minutes, and memoranda. [SIGHS] I understand that I had to give up my dress. But... But some things are impossible to part with. Marcus is right. You have to go to him. Come on. They want to start. -You have to put your clothes on. -[EXHALING] Come on. I lay here at night. With my arms open. [SNIFFLES] Waiting for him to come. [SNIFFLES] He's so closed, so distant. Yulek? Yulek? Yulek is a bear. The big, sweet teddy bear. I know he's your cousin and he's so good to me and I... [CHUCKLES] I'm not at all attracted to him. I... Don't you know, that I... That it's Zev. [SNIFFLING] Oh. [SOFTLY] Anda. You're blind. Don't you see Zev is in love with you? [SNIFFLES] [EXHALES] We mustn't go in there. I have to. They won't start without me. [EXHALES] Now, what is it that Sima wants, huh? Her dress pack? [SIGHS] Don't you see we've skipped ourselves of everything. We left our family, our friends, our possessions, our homes. Everything! But what is left, I ask you? What? We talk about making revolutions. Men and women who do not dare to touch each other! When I was sent here, they told me I was on my way to a temple of free love. You know what I found? MAN 1: We couldn't care less. MAN 2: Not at 2:00 in the morning. AMNON: I found a temple free of love. And a bunch of sour fist monks and some virgins drying up like unmilked cows. MAN: Why do we need to hear all this nonsense for? What do you stick around here for anyway? -Out of my way! -Amnon's right. And you know damn well he is. Otherwise, you wouldn't all be attacking him. We have forgotten what the word love means. Maybe that's just as well. In this community we're trying to reach beyond what you mean by love. Love will be something completely different once we've achieved our dream of collective being. Zev. Zev, tell me more about this collective being. I think maybe your collective being is a cover. A way of hiding your fear that if two people here really love each other. That no love will remain for the rest of us. Are we that unsure of ourselves? Yulek. [EXHALES] [SPLASHING WATER] SIMA: My brothers, we are too hard on ourselves. We are strangling any truth left among us. We have given birth, but in silence. We have made no room for our cries. I hear them, but I have no strength left to carry on. Go in peace. Sima, November 1st, 1919. [PRAYING IN HEBREW] There will be no prayers for the dead. Not here. [QUIVERS] [ZEV BREATHING HEAVILY] [AMNON PRAYING IN HEBREW] [PRAYING STOPS] Come no. We should go. Sima didn't commit suicide. We killed her. There's something else I want to say. Marcus, don't, please. I'm talking to you, Zev. Now, you used to be a fanatic, uncompromising servant of God and the Torah and then you changed all that and you... And you set out to create yourself anew. Now, you're a fanatic, uncompromising servant of what? You lecture us about change. You take a good look at your creation, Rabbi. The only new thing about you are the blisters on your hands. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I want to tell you something else. What you've gone through up till now is nothing compared to what awaits you. All of you. But I'm not staying here another minute. I'll settle for what Vienna can offer. [DOOR CREAKING] What happened? Something good has happened. It's raining. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Marcus! Marcus. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Take care of Anda. [MEN SINGING IN HEBREW] [SINGING STOPS] [HORSE WHINNYING] Do you know what this is? An orange. It's an orange tree. And what did I tell you about oranges? What did I tell you? You said, "Oranges won't grow on the ridge" but... They'll grow. It's a waste. Don't you understand? Oranges will die. They'll strangle there. It's the wrong kind of soil for oranges. They'll grow. We have no other choice. [SIGHS] Here. [HORSE WHINNYING] [ACCORDION PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHEERING AND CLAPPING] -[GRUNTING] -[AIR WHOOSHING] -[THUNDER CRACKING] -[SCREAMS] [SOBBING] [GRUNTING] [THUNDER CRACKLING] Yulek. -ANDA: Leave him alone! -Yulek [BREATHING HEAVILY] Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! -[GRUNTS] -Leave! [SOBBING] Please leave him alone! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! [WAILING] [THUNDER CRACKLING] [WAILING] ZEV: I gave up so very little out there. But you, everything. A woman loved, and in love. A doctor, with her own promising career in the future of Vienna's world. I've already lost one faith in my lifetime. Help me hold on to the one that remains, continue to believe in the path we have chosen, because you are the only guide I have left. I wanted to write more than this. Much more. Zev, December 24, 1919. [UTENSILS CLATTERING] [DOOR CREAKS] Muhamed is here with his daughter. It's an emergency. [CHILD CRYING] Where the hell do you think you're going? People are starving here. -Eating dirt! -[GLASS SHATTERS] Because of them! And you're going to doctor their children? [CHILD CRYING] Stop him! ANDA: Did I not devote myself first to life? Life which should not exist without justice? We cannot flourish without love. Anda, December 26, 1919. I'm afraid she may have to stay the night. AMNON: No. He already risked himself coming here. The girl goes with him. Tell him, please, to give this to her two times a day. [SNIFFLES] [BOTH SPEAKING ARABIC] [SNIFFLING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [WATER BUBBLING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Come on! Come on. Come on! Yeah! [LAUGHS] Boris, hold back! Yulek, not so fast! Wait! Wait a second! -Wait a second. -Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This moment should be immortalized. It's history! ZEV: Like a good and faithful mistress, this plot of land has awaited us. And now, after a long separation, we have been reunited. Zev, February 5th, 1920. Yeah! Yeah! Go! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY] May I? [GASPS] Such tiny, tiny letters. My father's handwriting. He started it when I was 10 years old. So it would be ready for my bar mitzvah in time. He worked on it every night. Are you going to live here now? When Marcus left, why didn't you stop him? I want you to stay here with us. With us? With me. [BLEATING] -[AMNON ULULATING] -[ANDA LAUGHING] -[ANDA ULULATING] -AMNON: Yeah. AMNON: Ho-ho, now, ho-ho. ANDA: Ho-ho, now. AMNON: Now, that's for the sheep to come. -[ANDA LAUGHING] -AMNON: For the goat it's... -[BOTH LAUGHING] [GASPS] [SOBBING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] How could you know he was setting a trap? [BREATHING HEAVILY] What good is revenge? Give me the gun. Give me the gun! It's not going to bring them back! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Anda. I love you. [SOBBING] [HOOVES BEATING] MUHAMED: Open the gate! [HORSE WHINNYING] [MAN SPEAKING ARABIC] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [COUGHING] [MAN ORDERING IN HEBREW] MAN: Daniel! Halpern! MAN: Ingale, damn it! Why don't you hurry up? [GUN COCKS] MAN: Yulia, get back to your position! Hurry! They are searching everywhere for him. Don't you understand? What do you want to do, throw him out of here? He's a wounded man! Anda. There's an army out there. If they find Muhamed inside, we don't stand a chance! It's a blood feud between Muhamed and Salim, don't you understand? We can't afford to interfere in their business. Rosa! Yulia! Follow me to the cave! ANDA: Daniel, I need some hands! Pizzicato. [SINGING ARABIC] [CHUCKLING] [CLICKING GUN] We have no moral obligation to help Muhamed. He's not alone. So let him take his friend with him. He's brought us nothing but trouble since the day he barged in here! He's as much a part of this place as any of us! Something changed your mind? You want a confession? We're lovers! Anda, we have to be rational! I've had it with being rational. We can't afford to be involved! Don't you see? With or without Muhamed, we are involved! Up to our necks! You can't just pack them away in a box with your skull cap and prayer shawl. Zev, you can't go on playing God. Amnon. Amnon, we're completely surrounded. Let him ride out alone and talk to them. It's him they want. It's not your affair. Amnon. Amnon, listen to me. Amnon, please, I beg you! You can't ride out there. It's suicide! Amnon, please! I beg you! Amnon! [ECHOING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GUNSHOTS] ANDA: Our dream was a grand one. Too grand perhaps. The dream of a new life. Of a new world. We went far. Too far. And our hearts forgot the simple things. To touch. To embrace. To accept. But at the price of suffering, we learned to forgive, ourselves as well. We made a compromise with our dream. Anda.
