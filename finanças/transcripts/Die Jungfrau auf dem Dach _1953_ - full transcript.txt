REGULAR PRICE $1.95 REDUCED TO $1.20 Six dozen rubber bands and two pumice stones. Hey! TICKET OFFICE OBSERVATION TOWER Follow that car! Why were you in such a terrible hurry? Excuse me? I just followed you into the ticket office and BANG - you were gone. Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't sure whether you were really... I mean, why didn't you say anything? I did. I even yelled, "Hey!" But you had already vanished like smoke. No, no, I mean before that in the shop. Why were you buying pumice stone? Because I sometimes have ink on my fingers and pumice stone takes it off. And all those rubber bands? What do you need them for? For my business. I didn't know you were watching me that closely. Oh, I think it's fascinating to watch what other people buy. You got razor blades, too. That's because I shave. But you didn't buy anything at all. I fell in love with a divine new shade of lipstick but it's $1.50 and that made me come to my senses. It's simply divine. It's called-- Dusty Dawn. A rather silly name, if you ask me. For me? Yes. I rarely use lipstick. How terribly sweet of you! You must have been watching me in the store! I've been watching you for quite a while. why didn't you smile at me like that in front of the jewelry shop? I never smile at men in front of jewelry shops. Yeah, fine. But then in the ticket office. It wouldn't have hurt you to smile there. You didn't have to scowl so angrily. I was trying to look sultry and provocative. Oh. And then you escaped into the elevator. Of course, because I knew that you were right behind me and... Gosh. Isn't this wonderful? Don't exaggerate. Fog's coming in. Can't see much today. You can see the islands out there! Nonsense. You can't see a thing. I can. You can hardly see the other skyscrapers! - I can! - Well, you're nuts. Fine. I can imagine it, anyway. Didn't you read the sign downstairs? "Visibility limited". Nobody's even up here. Oh, I don't care about that. I'm glad I came up here. Just think, we're over 1,000 feet above the sea! The world's tallest building! Well, I think it's wonderful. Of course, it was a shameful extravagance... But I don't care. It's worth every single penny. I completely forgot. Here's your money. For what? What money? Despite your sultry and provocative scowl, I asked for two tickets and the woman said that you'd already paid for yours, so I confessed that we'd just had a little lover's spat and then she gave me your money back. You mean you're treating me to this? Yes. How incredibly sweet of you. Thanks a lot. Now I can really enjoy it. And you don't even know my name. What's your name? Mine name's Patty. Patty O'Neill. Don Gresham. Don... Yes. That suits you. You look like a Don. Patty, I have to ask you something. See, I don't usually do things like this, - and I have a hunch-- - I wonder how this works. For a dime you can find out. Thanks. You're really nice. Before, when you came out, I was only pretending. That was pretty clear to me. This is terrific Now you can see for miles! Do you want to take a look? I've been up here quite often. My office is in this building. Are you drumming like that because you're bored or nervous? Or do you want to hold my hand? You're definitely a screwball. But you have very lovely hands. What's wrong? - I want to cry. - What for? All those people. What people? - In Brooklyn! - Brooklyn's over there. It doesn't matter. That's why I have to cry. But why? Because it's so sad. What, living in Brooklyn? Don't joke around like that. I was born in Brooklyn. I'm not trying to joke around. I swear. I just have no idea what you're talking about. All those unimposing little people, sweating for their daily bread-- Nobody's sweating on a day like this. Don't worry. Don't be so disgustingly practical. Look, Patty. It's getting all foggy. Shall we go back down? No. I like it here. Aren't you getting cold at all? Only my hands. They always get cold when I get excited. What are you excited about? Coming up here. I've wanted to for years. Then why didn't you come up sooner? Frankly, I couldn't afford it. You can get a pair of first-class nylons for $1.20. I don't know what came over me either. You're very sweet. I swear I had no idea that you would step in like that. To think, $1.20 just to go up to the roof of an old building. It'll never stay on that way. Nonsense. It's as strong as iron. Okay, so it's not as strong as iron. Come on, let's go eat instead, hm? - No. - Why not? You've spent far too much on me already. Don't be silly. You have, too. A ticket to the roof and a lovely lipstick. And don't forget the dime for the gadget. That's right. Here's the button. Do you happen to have a needle and thread with you? Of course! I'll sew it on for you right now. Hold the needle, please No scissors? The button. Oh, for goodness' sake. Now-- Now you've dropped the needle! Oh... We'll never find it. Why don't we go to my office and you can sew it on for me there? Are you sure you've got a needle there? My secretary is full of needles. Okay, fine. We'll try it. What is your job there, anyway? Architect. Oh, that explains the ink and the pumice stone. Are you a draftsman? Believe it or not, I'm a full-fledged architect. I'll build you what you want, from a cathedral to a bomb shelter. What does a cathedral cost these days? A small one, for example? You even have your name on the door. Are you famous? No, not in the slightest. Just a good, modern architect for use straight from the factory. Didn't you say your secretary would be here? Don't be silly. She leaves at 5:00. I merely said she would have needles here. Okay. Let's look. Don't ask me why that animal's biting himself in the foot. I don't know myself. There must be a needle and thread here somewhere. Let's see. There. Paper clips... Kleenex... These are just stamps. There. Getting warmer... Pins. Have you ever really seen her with a needle and thread? I can hardly imagine-- If you saw my secretary, you would know at first sight that she must always have a needle and thread somewhere. Let's take a look in my office. Isn't that fun? Like an umbrella stand. Now I know why you need all those rubber bands. - May I take a look? - Sure. "Freeport City Library". Did you build this? It's being built now. Look for the needle! Okay. In the file under "N". It must be a great feeling for you to look at such a building when it's standing there finished and to say, "It all started in my head." I'll let you in on a secret. The first job I ever did on my own was a huge, hideous red brick warehouse. I used to drive out there at night sometimes when there wasn't a soul left around and sit in my car for hours just starting at it. All alone? Staring at an old brick building is not something you can invite other people to do. Oh, I could imagine it's more fun to have someone to stare with you. Who's that? Her name is Cynthia. She's quite cute. Very cute, even. Why isn't it standing on your desk? It was once. Are you in love with her? Hardly. Maybe I used to be, sort of. Not anymore, anyway. Is she in love with you? How can a person tell? When a girl gives a man her picture, that's generally proof. Were you engaged to her? More or less, so to speak. A little bit or not at all. It's all off now. It's obvious that my secretary has run off with every needle to be had. Where would you like to eat? Nowhere. Oh, don't be a silly goose now. We're eating together and I don't want to hear any more protest. Okay, deal. Where could we go? Wherever you wish. Do you have a lot of money? Make your wish. - Could you take me to the Golden Star? - Done. It's outrageously expensive, though! None of the boys I know can afford it. We usually go 50/50 on a goulash. Mmm, I'm not very partial to goulash. Are you partial to the Golden Star? I haven't been there very often. Like the-- Like the name says, it's more for people in show business and-- I'm in show business! I'm an actress. Oh. With success or without? For now more "without". Are you one of those unbearably showbiz-obsessed creatures who simply can't do anything else? No. Actually not. I'd just as soon get married. Oh, why am I kidding you? I-- I'm just dying to get married, but I'm very choosy so it won't be so easy. The men I like don't grow on trees. I suppose they'd rather prowl the lobby of the Empire State Building picking up girls. Don't worry. You're not the type I'm looking for. - Not at all? - Not in the slightest. You just looked sort of orphaned and helpless as you were there fiddling with your silly button and-- Well... I wanted to get to know you. But you're much too young. - Have you ever been married? - No! Well, when I get married I'd like a nice older man with a giant bank account. preferably one who's already been married and has gruesome memories. For all I care he can have give kids, too. That sounds highly romantic. Oh, nonsense. Romance is for teenage girls. I'm rather have a man who understands and appreciates me than one who's gushing with love. Do I seem like I'm gushing? I think it's sweet. I have a very affectionate disposition myself. Let's see. Is Cynthia affectionate? You ask too many questions. Come on. Why did you tell him East 79th Street between Fifth and Madison? That's not where the Golden Star is at all. That's where my apartment is. Surely you don't want me to go to the Golden Star with a missing button. - Yeah, but-- - There is no "but". We'll have a drink first, then we'll find a needle. Then you'll sew my button on. A bachelor doesn't have any needles. But I'm an unusual bachelor. You aren't afraid to come up with me, are you? I'll have to think it over first. Would you try to seduce me? I don't know. Probably. Why? "Why"? A girl has to know! A girl follows her sixth sense about such things. You can't just go around asking questions like that. I can. I always do. And if someone says yes, he wants to seduce you, what then? I usually believe him. I lose out on a dinner. And if someone says he has honorable intentions? I usually believe him, too. But you get fooled sometimes. I can't stand men like that. After all, there are lots of girls who are perfectly happy to be seduced. Why not stick to them? Fine. I won't make the slightest attempt. You believe me? Yes. You're nice and personable. And if I'm lying? That may be, after all. That's true. Are you lying? Frankly, I don't exactly know. I've never come across someone like you before. How nice. But I won't promise that I'm not going to kiss you. But why not? Kissing is fine. I don't have anything against that. Well, I'll be darned if I know whether you're really so excessively naive or whether you're just putting me on. Well, pay attention. Totally unnaively. When a girl goes into a man's apartment with him, there are always two possibilities. Either she wants to lose her virginity or she doesn't. If she doesn't, then there's a fight. I don't want to lose my virginity and I think that fighting is vulgar. So I always put my cards on the table beforehand. Isn't that completely sensible? White flag. You win. Gentle affection, no wild urges. Word of honor. "Gentle affection, no wild urges." I think that's charming. You could found a new party with that slogan. You're really very sweet even if you are a little crazy. Patty O'Neill. That sounds incredibly Irish. Both my parents were born in Brooklyn, but my father is of Irish descent. When he gets jolly or mad, he still talks like he has a mouth full of mush. - What does he do? - He's with the police. Got change for ten dollars? Yes, sir. Are you completely sure that you really want to come up with me? - Absolutely. - No qualms? Not in the slightest. And I don't have the slightest doubt about your virility, either. Let's leave my virility out of this. Gladly. I just don't want you to feel insulted. Men are so funny about that. They don't find it flattering at all when someone trusts them. Pardon me, lady, but what makes you trust him so implicitly? It may sound corny, but I think he's a man of honor. A woman can tell. I got three daughters. I only hope they can tell, too. Here you go, mister. Oh, thank you kindly. For what I learned on that trip, I'd have to pay my psychiatrist at least 25 bucks. I'm so glad you don't mind. Mind what? Most men are bored to death with a virgin. I'm so glad you're not like that. Have you taken many girls up to your apartment? I can't seem to remember at the moment. Won't the elevator boy make a face? The elevator boy is a button and you press it. That was Cynthia. Didn't you say it was all off? As far as I'm concerned, completely. She didn't look as if it were completely off at all. She looked more as if she were about to go. After you. This way. Excuse me. Hello? Oh, hello, Mike! No, sorry, pal, not today. Today I'm going out. Sure. Later this week? Okay. Good night. - Who is Mike? - A friend of mine. - Are you mad at him? - Not at all. Why? You hung up so quickly. Because there was no more to say. He asked me if I wanted to eat with him and I told him that I can't. Well, fine, but you could have talked to him. Well, I always talk with my friends. For hours. I can imagine. Where are you going with Cynthia's picture? I'm putting her in the drawer with my winter socks. Facedown. Who could have done that? KISS MY ASS!! Oh. No idea. Maybe the cleaning lady who comes here every day. Must have been a very refined cleaning lady. Why would she write that to you on the mirror? I've been forgetting to leave her a tip for weeks. There are needles, as promised. What would you like to drink? A martini? No, thanks. At most a fruit juice or a Coca-Cola. Oh, sorry. I'm fresh out of fruit juice and Coke. Never mind. Then... Maybe an olive or something. Give me your coat. Olive? And where do you have the button? Coat. Button. It's by Picasso. Do you like it? Frankly, I think it's atrocious. I like your apartment a lot, but if it were mine, The first thing I'd throw out would be that thing there. I like it. Then why don't you hang it in your bedroom? I like it where it is. And it's staying there, too. What a totally divine kitchen this is. You should see the stove in our apartment. Vicky swears the first immigrants from Holland must've brought it with them. - Vicky? - Mmm-hmm. My roommate. And an electric garbage disposal that you just throw everything in. Anyway, Vicky says she'd give herself body and soul to the first man who'd offer her a kitchen with a garbage disposal. Don't you like martinis? I used to, but I gave up drinking. Why? I think it's sort of high school to drink and smoke when you're not really keen on it. Do you mind if I take my shoes off? Take off anything you like. You have very lovely feet. Thank you. Do you have a mistress? Mistress? Isn't that a rather old-fashioned term? It may be old-fashioned, but it's factually correct. So, do you have one? You ask the most unbelievable questions. What's so unbelievable about it, though? You're a bachelor and you're well-off, it seems. And most bachelors have one. So it's a perfectly natural question. It isn't a bit natural. You don't go around asking every man if he has a mistress. I always ask. It saves so much time and one finds out sooner or later anyway. So do you have one? A mistress, I mean. No, if it's of interest to you. I don't have one. Oh, good. I'm glad. Yeah, but why don't you have one? Oh, you needn't tell me if you don't want to. Well, maybe I think it's high school to have a mistress when you're not really keen on it. Do you know that that's really very true? - Was Cynthia-- - She was not my mistress. I didn't even ask that, though. You were just going to. I only caught a glimpse of her but she is really... lovely. She has a very pretty chin. Oh, she's very pretty all over. Then she was your mistress! She was nothing of the sort. Yeah, but you just said she was pretty all over. So I have to assume that... Why do you really have nothing other than sex on your mind? - Who, me? - Yes, you. Do I really? Yes, when you're always asking if people want to seduce you or if they're bored with virgins or if they have a mistress. If that isn't being preoccupied with sex, I'd like to know what is. Well, you may be right, but... Isn't it better for a girl to be preoccupied with it than to be occupied with it? Now you have two needles. It has begun to rain. How long have you been split up with Cynthia? Since last night or since this morning, uh... Sometime in between. Is that why she wrote Geothe's Swabian Salute on the mirror? Oh, you didn't believe me at all - that it was the cleaning lady. - Not for a second. Are you miserable? Why should I be miserable? Oh, you stuck her facedown in your winter socks and when I asked you if you are still in love with her, you shilly-shallied. Fine. She left an aching void in my heart. Satisfied? Why did you break it off? Or did she? You definitely ask too much. Oh, I know. I'm sorry, but I'm really not inquisitive. I'm just so interested in other people. - Heavens, what time is it? - Just about 8:30. Why? Oh, that's too late. My show went on at 8:00. You're on television tonight? Yes, we filmed it two weeks ago. Too bad, I would've liked to see it. Never mind. It goes on again at midnight. Fine! Then we'll watch it together. Oh no. I'll already long be home dutifully tucked in bed by then. But you can watch it. Midnight on channel 4. - Okay. Shall we go eat? - Yes, let's go. Wait a minute. Without a raincoat you're gonna get soaked. I know what we'll do. We won't go out at all. We'll eat up here. I'm a sensational cook! Unfortunately I have nothing sensational to cook. You must have something or other. Well, I was sure you'd at least have some leftovers. You know, no one can believe what I concoct out of leftovers. - Do you like kabelutschki? - I beg your pardon? Kabelutschki. You make it out of old cod and leftover potato salad. You really don't have any old cod? For God's sake, no! Don't say "For God's sake, no". There's nothing horrible about it at all. It tastes delicious! Look, Patty, the only halfway edible thing is this small crock of cheese someone gave me last Christmas. Green cheese! I-- - It's going green. Poison green. See? - Don't you ever eat at home? - Never. Oh, it's no wonder that you're so unhappy and in poor shape. I'm not a bit unhappy, and my shape is simply splendid. Well, I think it's sad. Heartbreaking. this darling kitchen all for nothing. The lovely icebox, the divine stove, the garbage disposal that no one uses. It makes me cry. Honestly. It does. You're the strangest girl that I've ever met. Oh, you didn't meet me. You picked me up. You don't have to keep rubbing it in. I do have to. I think both of us should always be clear about that. Why? Because-- I just think we should, that's all. That's all. Why? Just in case we should start feeling something for each other. Would that be so bad? Yes. I let myself be be picked up by you and no matter what happens, you'll always rack your brain about it. What about? About all the others who might have already picked me up before. I've already been racking my brain about that. Do you do it very often? Once is enough to leave doubts forever. My doubts are completely dispersed. Completely. Maybe for the time being, but then they come creeping back. Did you build this? Not yet. I'd like to someday. It's just an idea of mine. Sort of a vacation hideaway. I really like it. Of course, you won't find such magnificent old trees anywhere. The trees are already there. It's a piece of property I own. One day I'll build this shack precisely so that it fits into the trees. Is that the bedroom? Mmm-hmm. Windows on three sides. And there's the fireplace. It's a huge fireplace. You can roast an entire ox in it if you want. That must be fun. Roasting an ox in the bedroom. The limbs of the oak tree here nearly reach the roof. Do you see? Well, if I had an oak tree like that, I'd live in it. You know, when I was a little kid, we always-- Do you like children? Ah, I can't stand them. I suppose you think it would be unfair to bring kids into this mess of a world. And who is supposed to clean up this mess of a world? Unborn kids, perhaps? I never even thought of it that way. Then think about it. When you have time. Now, what about our dinner? Nah. Even I can't do anything with moldy old cheese. There's a store next door. I have a raincoat. I can get everything you need. Yeah? Swell! I simply adore cooking. I just rarely get a chance to cook for a man. I live together with a girl. I'm very relieved to hear it. Now who has sex on their mind? Okay. So what should I bring back? I'll make you a list. Don't bother me. I don't want to forget anything. I'm writing everything down for you but sugar and salt. I'll leave those to your imagination. There. Here. Go on. What are you waiting for? I've decided not to found a new party. At least not with the slogan you suggested to me. "Gentle affection, no wild urges." No, I'd rather-- You don't have any urges at all now, you're hungry. And so am I. Now go get the items. Okay. I'll be back in a flash. Put your rubbers on. It's pouring like crazy. My dear child, I never wear rubbers. You put them on. What... Don't be so bossy. I'm not bossy, I'm maternal. How old are you? 26. Why? Just a second. 26, half of that is 13. Plus 7... Is 20! It works out! It works out exactly! What works out? Haven't you ever heard that the girl is supposed to be half the man's age plus 7? What girl? And what man? Never mind. Beat it. I think I'll also by rolls, butter, and jam. Hmm? Well, calm down, Vicky. He's an architect. And he has a just enchanting apartment on 79th street, two buildings from 5th Avenue. His name is Donald Gresham. And he has soft, blue eyes, like a forget-me-not. And-- Just a second. Stay on the line. There's somebody at the door. Oh, good evening. You're Cynthia, aren't you? I've already heard so much about you. And what a delightful dog. Don went out. He's buying some steaks. Then I'm cooking for us both. Say, why did you write Goethe's Swabian salute on the mirror? What happened? Won't you come in and wait for Don? It won't be long. Well, believe me, Vicky. He couldn't harm a fly. He loves children and he owns a downright marvelous old oak tree. Yes, right. Oak tree. Why? I'll explain it to you later, though. Someone's at the door again already. Yes, yes, sweetie. Yes. Yes, good night and don't worry. - Well, I'll be-- - What will you be? Oh, sorry. I'm completely speechless. I didn't expect to find a girl here. Why not, though? It's a very innocuous hour, after all. Yes, yes. I wasn't trying to say that... I mean... Is Mr. Gresham home? No, he went down just now, but he'll be back again soon. - Won't you come in? - No, I think I'd rather go. You know, I live directly above Don, you see, and... - I wanted to go-- - Maybe you'd like something to drink? Yes, in fact I must drink something. I'm in urgent need of it. Between us, I still have a small hangover from last night. - And in that case a sip-- - I'm familiar with it. I've already cured more hangovers than a dog has fleas. My name is David Slater. May I know yours too? Patty. Patty O'Neill. Oh, pretty name. Hmm-hmm. Have you known Don long? Oh, yes. That is, we haven't known each other very long yet. It just seems like an eternity. He's an angel. I'm totally mad about him. Very interesting. And he is just as mad about you? Oh, it's purely platonic on both sides. Yes, yes, of course. I only took my shoes off because my feet hurt. Never say that your feet hurt. Why not, if they do? "My foot", singular, "hurts" is a stimulating statement. "My feet", plural, "hurt" is a rather sordid admission. Have a seat. The fauteuil whirls around. Yes, most of the fauteuils that I sit on whirl around. Aren't you drinking something, too? No, thanks. I don't drink. Do you know Cynthia? Yes. Why? She was sort of engaged to Don, so to speak. What do you mean by "so to speak"? Seems more or less to have been a sort of a loose relationship. Loose? Did he use the word "loose"? Oh, no. But, anyway, it's all off now. Yes, I know. He just put her facedown with his winter socks. Was she a beast? That's not an entirely uncomplicated question. Why? Either she was one or she wasn't one. It's not as simple as that. Why? Well, if you absolutely must know... She happens to be my daughter. Oh! - I understand. - Mmm. I'm glad. I'm terribly sorry, but... If I'd suspected you were her father, naturally I never would've thought of asking you if she's a beast. You couldn't have come to a better source. She is one. Well, anyway, she's very pretty. Yeah, what... What did you just say there about his winter socks? Oh, nothing. Don went down to buy some steaks just now. I'm a terrific cook, you know? Terrific. - Do you like steaks? - Oh, I'm mad about steaks. Then why don't you stay here and eat with us? Oh, I'd rather not. Thank you very much all the same. I assume it's because of Cynthia. I mean, were you the reason why they split up? Did you disapprove or something? No, no, on the contrary. I intended to love him like a son. More than a son! Do you know I'd been practically chasing after him, ready to give my blessing any moment? Isn't Cynthia all broken up about it? No. She rarely gets broken up. I, though. I am. I was so counting on that boy. Oh. Then you're sore because they split up. You know, I don't have the slightest idea what happened except that Don told me it was off. Are you furious with Don? I mean, has he done something that shouldn't be done? That's what I'd like to find out. That's mainly why I'm here. According to the theory, Don should be horsewhipped. - By me. - Why? Well, that's what Cynthia said this morning, I think. You think? Don't you know? I wasn't feeling so fit yet this morning. You know, she said a lot of things, like-- Like what, for instance? Well, it appears as if he... played a frivolous and base game with my daughter's feelings. That doesn't sound like Don. I wasn't quoting him. Whom else? Your wife, perhaps? Why, no, we've been divorced for years. No, "frivolous and base" were Cynthia's rather unoriginal expressions. I was not cut out to raise a daughter. Yeah, what Cynthia needs is a good influence. - A mother, probably. - Mmm. Either that or a good kick in the pants. Well, couldn't you provide her with one or the other? You still look awfully young. Why don't you marry again? Unfortunately, the woman to whom I am attracted would not be quite the right influence. Then why don't you kick her in the pants sometimes? An attractive thought. Listen, since you seem to know him pretty well, do you consider our friend to be a man of serious principles? I don't know what you're driving at. If you were a father then you would know. You're worried about Cynthia. Is she pregnant? No, of course not... What gives you that idea? Isn't that usually the reason when fathers worry? Indeed it is. Oh, Mr. Slater, you don't have the slightest reason to worry. I don't know Cynthia, but Don would never do something like that. He doesn't believe in it. Just don't think about it anymore. Stay here for a cozy dinner, then you won't take everything so tragically anymore. Between us, I am very tempted, but oughtn't we ask Don first? Why? I'm sure it's okay with him. He may have something in mind. For dessert. Oh, no. That's all been discussed. I only agreed to come up here after he promised not to make a pass. And he hasn't. Couldn't you imagine that after a steak he might become more impassioned? Oh, yes, hopefully! I like being kissed. You know, he hasn't even kissed me since the Empire State Building. You mean since it was built? Oh, don't be so childish. We met there. In an enchanting fog. Mix yourself another bathtub full. With your permission. Shall I turn on the television? Is it in color? You're crazy. It won't be in color for years. Oh, then let's wait until then. It's pouring down. What kind of a car do you drive? A Lincoln. Why? Have you seen the new Cadillac? - Oh, yes. - It has an exciting gadget. Whenever it starts to rain, you press a little button, and then water drizzles over the windshield so that the wiper won't smear it. I always think of it the moment it starts to rain. You drive a Cadillac? My God, wherever--? You're funny. But the boy Vicky goes with has one, and sometimes he lets me-- not drive, just press the button. Vicky says-- - Vicky? - Yeah. She lives with me. Oh, you'd like her. She's so fetching. She's all of two years older but clucks over me like a mother hen. She's a model. Are you also a model? Oh, sometimes, but not really. I'm an actress. That is, I want to be one. It's a hard life. The competition is simply brutal. Poor Vicky. She's having a hard time. No market for models? I don't mean professionally, I mean more concerning the heart. You see, the boy with the Cadillac, he loves her a lot and he is terribly rich and has absolutely everything he wants. You call that having a hard time? Well, yes, it's just because he's married and he wouldn't displease his wife for anything in the world. - He studied in England. - How sad. Where I studied, displeasing wives was a mandatory course. Does Cynthia do anything? I mean, like... acting school or modeling or something like that. - Nothing. - She does nothing at all? Nothing at all. At least nothing that a father could be proud of. Can you do something that she as a daughter could be proud of? What's the matter? Knockout. Serves you right. Parents who constantly complain about their children make me sick. I always say it's the parents' fault. Don't ever say it again. - Why not? - Because it's banal. And true. It's never too late to change. Do you always say that, too? You would actually have the makings of a great father. I like the funny wrinkles in the corners of your eyes. Why are you standing up? It seemed like it would be better. Why? Frankly, my child, I suddenly felt a commanding and equally ignoble desire to kiss you until your lips bleed. Really? Oh, lovely! Today is a lucky day for me! And rather than yield to that ignoble desire-- What's so ignoble about it? I think it's wonderful to be desired. There's just one point I'd like to clear up. Aren't you already in a relationship with Don? I you want to know the exact details, we only met this afternoon. We sort of picked one another up on the roof of the Empire State Building. That will do. Oh, don't get the wrong idea. It was all perfectly proper. Hey! Quick, it's me! Yes, yes, I'm coming. Holy sea cow! I got enough food here to last a month's siege. Greetings, old boy! In view of that cordial welcome, I'd better clear off. You stay here. Don! Come here! What the devil are you doing here? I invited Mr. Slater to have dinner with us. You did what? Don't be so rude! I think you're awful! Mr. Slater came to visit you, and I asked him-- In that case, I must inform you - that Mr. Slater-- - I know everything. He's Cynthia's father, but that doesn't matter. He's not mad at you at all and he's not going to horsewhip you, either. He's not going to what? My dear child, you talk too much. Horsewhipping is a routine that you don't know anything about yet. No? Perhaps you will explain it to me. Uh... Patty, would you leave us alone for a few minutes? Men talk, honey. But of course. I have to start cooking anyway. Meanwhile you two can chat away to your heart's content. If you have wet feet, then change your socks. You look like you need it. I say, that's a charming girl. Yes. Charming thing, hmm? I've known her for years. Good family! Yes, lots of good families live in the Empire State Building. I might have guessed. How long have you been here? Oh, ten, fifteen minutes. She didn't stop talking for one second. Fine, I picked her up. But that's why she's a nice girl. But of course. I agree with you completely. She is... She is enchanting! So go ahead. What is this horsewhipping routine? My daughter came home at 10 this morning. - Right. - She spent the whole night with you. Right again. That is, she spent the night in this apartment. - She claims-- - She lies. I never touched her. Moreover, I don't believe you. Cynthia has many faults, - but she would never claim-- - Yes, but she openly-- She lies! Don't keep yelling "she lies" in that dramatic tone before I can even get a word out. I will now try to recollect exactly what... ...what she really did say. Go ahead. All right, this morning I was about to have breakfast, or more precisely an Aspirin, then Cynthia comes breezing in wearing a black, strapless gown. You could have knocked me over with a your little finger! Fair enough, I... I know she often comes home late. Oh... at 3 o'clock, at 4 o'clock, at 5 o'clock in the morning! But never at 10! Go on? I asked her where... where she had been all night, and she told me she'd slept down here. Openly. In plain language. You could have knocked me over with your little finger! Again? Oh, this time it was an entirely different finger. Imagine, my own daughter tells me she slept down here with you. So in short, I say to her... Yeah, what did I say? "Good God." "Good God," I said. "You should never have done that." Well, or something in that price range. My God, I feel uneasy on a high moral plane. And what did she say? "You're quite right," she said. "I made a grave error." Then she staggered into her room, slammed the door, and hopped into the shower. While you searched for a horsewhip. This is no reason to be making jokes, young man. My daughter says she'd trusted you and you'd shamefully betrayed her trust. Her own words. Is that all she said? No details? No, that was all. "He shamefully betrayed my trust." She repeated it several times. She lies. I never touched her. Never. Believe it or not, I didn't touch her. You didn't touch her? Well, then that's probably precisely what Cynthia meant. But of course! Now I can understand her! An extremely humiliating experience. By all accounts I should beat you up! You don't say. You want to beat me up because I didn't seduce your daughter? Quite a new twist, isn't it? Who is it? Let me in, you coward! Let me in! Cynthia! I suppose that girl is still here. Yeah, don't act so innocent. I saw her. She opened the door for me. In stockings. What is she, a yokel? Please, Cynthia, don't make a scene here now. Let's try to behave like civilized people. I am the most civilized woman - you ever met in your life. - Oh yes, oh yes. That's why you scrawl such civilized words on other people's mirrors, too. I'm telling you, if you treat that poor thing like me, then she will probably also write "kiss my ass" on the mirror. That is, if she can write. The last thing you said when you slipped out this morning - was that you never wanted to darken this door again. - What gives her the idea? - She gets it from her mom! - Let me in, you hypocrite, you! Over my dead body. Your daughter is a girl who can't say no. And she expects the same from everyone else. I don't doubt your word, but I'm trying to envision what really happened between you and Cynthia last night. And why! I can help you envision it. We went out to dinner and then to the theater together. I brought her home about midnight. We took the elevator straight up to your apartment. I said "Good night" to her at the door and went back down. Five minutes later she showed up here. She told me she found you up there completely drunk and with a young lady. "Young" is true. That's the reason why she didn't go back up. Too degrading? Nonsense. She didn't want to be a killjoy. So she slept in my bed and I here on the couch. A lovely night was not had by all of us last night. If everything you are telling me is true, why would a young man like you sleep on the couch? Apart from moral constraints, which are of course foreign to you, the young man might not want to be committed. Uh, pardon my asking, but weren't you more or less engaged to my daughter? Ah, there's a vast difference between an engagement and a commitment. Between you and me, I was unwilling to lose the initiative. I've though long and hard about it. Deep thinker, eh? If you want to shoot a goal, then don't wish that the goalie kicks the ball for you. Nah, I don't have a clue about soccer. But is it a rule that... that the center forward himself plays goalie at the same time? Who blew the whistle? Geez. What are you fighting about now? - Soccer, possibly? - Yes. We were just discussing a missed goal. Mmm. Tastes very good so far. Truly delicious. - No ketchup? - Coming right up. - Uh... I'll get it. - She'll find it. You'll only confuse her. A bit inconsiderate to let the poor kid do all the work alone. No fake consideration. Women enjoy working. Let me do it. I'm a bit stronger. Why are men so helpless? I'll show you. We should have had champagne! Forgive me. I didn't know that you were coming. - Here you are. - Oh! Thank you. Nothing is coming out. Seems to be stuck. Oh! Oh, you and your ketchup! You weren't even aiming it at your plate! Sorry. Oh, I think you'd better do it yourself. I have an idea, Patty. I'll lend you a dressing gown. - Then you can clean your dress better. - Oh, good. I've had enough, Slater. Take your steak and eat it in your apartment. But my dear boy, I can't leave that poor defenseless girl alone with you, after all. Half naked? I could never forgive myself. Well, isn't that a good dinner I've whipped up there? I've never eaten so well. And you? Aren't you going to say anything? Would you like to get married someday and stay married? Mmm-hmm. My wife was born in Austria. A charming little person. And she could make nockerln. Real Salzburger nockerln. Superb. I never ate less than three of them and every time I said, "Delicious nockerln!" "Heavenly nockerln!" Yes, once even "Now those are nockerln!" But then, an hour later, while I was still busy peacefully digesting them, she would always say, "Well? Weren't the nockerln good?" You know what happened? You divorced her. No, she divorced me. Due to inhumanity on my part. I hit her with the nockerl pan. You didn't! A brand-new Starck pan. Still hot from the nockerln. Right on her behind. The welt lasted weeks in-- in all colors. According to her lawyer. I no longer had the privilege of seeing it. The welt, I mean. I don't believe you. Why not? It's just like him. Yes, it's the absolute truth. You struck a woman? Certainly. I only strike women, you see. I'm a peaceable person. Also very cowardly. Don't be so modest. Occasionally you'd even strike a small weak man. If he's completely defenseless, yes. Well, I think you're awful. It's hardly surprising that your wife divorced you. It's just a surprise that he married a woman at all. But don't you find that I have a certain wicked charm? I do. That's the trouble with you. You have far too much charm. And "wicked" is a compliment. I would call it something else. Be sure I love you, too. - My former wife says-- - Shh! I want to listen! Oh, for crying out loud, what do you want now? No. No, I wouldn't think of it. Okay then. If you don't don't want to come up, throw out that little slut! Please stop taking that tone, okay? Fine. Bid farewell to the young lady and I'll come to you. No way. Completely out of the question. Just as well. If you're so brute and callous, then I'll drown myself in the bathtub. Stop that talk. Talk? Do you want to hear the water? Do you hear it? Do you hear the water? Yes, b-b-but see... I... D-d-don't do anything stupid. Listen. I have a proposal. I can be dressed in two minutes. Meet me in the lobby and take me for a drink at Luigi's. A little drink to our good friendship. Done. For all I care. But quick as a flash. I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go out for a few minutes. Oh, w-- Where? Just 10 or 15 minutes. - No, but-- - Oh, let him go. He's not very entertaining tonight anyway. Hardly said a word. Oh, there were a few on the tip of my tongue, but you were lucky. There was a lady present. You've never needed so little time to get dressed. Oh, don't trouble yourself so much with that. The cleaning lady can do that. No, I like to tidy up. Cleanliness is the first step to virtue. May be. But virtue is not up my alley. What is up your alley? Steak, alcohol, and broads. In precisely that order. You're not half as depraved as you act. You just want people to believe that. If that's true, wouldn't you like to marry me, then? To be thrashed with nockerl pans? Quit joking. It was a mistake of me to boast about that act. But you are significantly stronger than my ex-wife. You might hit back. I'd be a lot more careful with you. - Well? - Well what? Get married. Would you like to? How foolish you would feel now if I said yes. Not at all. I'm hoping that you'll say yes. That's why I asked. I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on earth. My dear thing, that's a purely emotional and ill-considered figure of speech. If I were the last man on earth and there were a million women left, you'd be fighting tooth and claw with every single one of them for the privilege of becoming my wife. You'd be panting to repopulate the world. Don't make a fool of yourself. Your love of the human race would overcome your prejudice against me. You're seriously mistaken there. I don't think the human race is so great. And I'm not prejudiced against you. Can't you hear a dog barking, too? Of course I can. It's Cynthia's poodle. Ah, look! That blasted dog! Oh, be reasonable. Such a small dog can't possibly make such a large spot-- Where are you going? Take of your shoes. You're gonna get wet. If you think I'm gonna wade in there, you're profoundly mistaken. The Eskimos are the most civilized people in the world. Why? They have enough sense to sell their daughters at birth. I wish I could exchange Cynthia for a girl of your incomparable neatness. You really don't want to think it over and marry me? Really. Isn't that cute? Sickening. I still need a few rags. Get some towels. There in the cabinet. And as for my marriage proposal, if you adhere to tradition, I'd be happy to go down on my knee as soon as you've mopped up. Do you always propose to girls you don't know? No. But I've occasionally asked a few chance acquaintances to live with me without the blessing of the church. Why didn't you propose that to me? You know, it is often alleged that decent young girls are always led astray by older playboys. The opposite is the case. Only playboys have a natural respect for innocence. You're sweet. And probably a little drunk. No. I'm comparatively sober. Then you must be crazy. Why? It's on record that you want to marry a well-heeled man of mature years. I'm 44. Hard to believe. You act like an adolescent. It must be an irresistible combination. You could mother me. No, thanks. Then you could mother Cynthia. Thanks, yes. She'd be delighted by that. I'm all of two years older. Wonderful! If Cynthia and Don make it together, then you could be his mother-in-law. Doesn't that appeal to you? You shouldn't joke about it. Marriage is a much too serious matter. Plus you don't know anything at all about me. Oh, I know enough. You're intelligent. You're efficient. You have initiative. You're infectiously young and gay. You're an excellent cook and you also have a pretty face, a lovely figure, and... terrific legs. Please go on. That should be enough for you. It's enough for me. You haven't said a word about love. There is far too much said about that in general. Nevertheless, a girl wants to hear them. From a man like Don, maybe? Maybe. You told us both that you would like to find a nice mature man who knows how to appreciate you. Yes, but a girl would also like to be happy, by the way. I have a natural talent for making people happy. With nockerl pans? Well, that was a clear, clean cut. She married a rich Brazilian almost immediately afterwards and is now living happily as a snail in its house. She also got a big settlement. Well. Now we can go downstairs again. I am very happy here! If you decide to leave, then I will probably call up a dame I know and ask her to come up. Don't say, "dame". That sounds too vulgar. At least say, "girl". Well, this girl is vulgar in the sense of natural and uninhibited. By common definition she is by her nature a dame rather than a girl. One can have a delightful time with her. Then why don't you ask her to marry you? Oh, because she'd immediately lose all respect for me if I made such an idiotic suggestion. Are you perhaps about to reconsider my proposal? You know, it's very strange with you. You're really horrible and cynical and shallow and... immoral and a completely worthless person altogether. And I like you! I like you very much, in fact! Enough to get married? Not that. - Are you rich? - Oh, yes. Quite comfortable. Oh, what the hell. Let's be honest. I'm rich. I've never worked a day in my life, and if I never do, I'll always have a large income, despite taxes. Why? I often wonder what it would be like to have a lot of money. Or at least some money. Many girls I know marry just for security. It's a big temptation. Do you have any idea how much money I have in the world at the moment? I suspect you have $7.43 in cash and a bankbook that shows no balance whatsoever. I'm not psychic, but I looked in your purse while you were cooking. That wasn't very ethical. Oh, I never claimed to be ethical. You know, next Tuesday I'll be on a television show. Maybe. And then, if everything goes well, I'll get $62.50. Then with my seven I'll have almost 70 dollars. Once I even had over 200. Over 200 dollars for a whole week. That's a feeling you don't know because you're rich. - What? - Yeah! The exciting fact of knowing that you have more than 200 dollars. It's wonderful! You feel like you could just go out and spit in the face of the first person you see. I won exactly $600 playing cards two nights ago. My God. - Weren't you completely giddy? - Mmm... Don't be so blasé. No one can be that rich. I said to myself, "Now you have 600 bucks more." I ask myself, "For what?" I still have them here. Six brand-new beautiful bills. You must be crazy to carry all that money around with you! I lost a purse once with over $20 in it. I was sick for weeks. Patty, I'd like very much to give you this $600. You must be crazy. Will you accept it? No, of course not. There are no consequences attached to it. But why should you-- I just told you that I got no joy at all from winning the money. Give me that joy and accept it. Oh, but I can't take money from-- How many times does 40 go into 600? 15 times. Why? That's my average. 40 a week. Gosh! 15 carefree weeks! Okay? I don't know what to do. I've never taken money from a man. I won it from an extremely unpleasant capitalist. Who lives off the sweat of the poor. Okay? It's a dreadful temptation. Would you think me a fool if I said no? An egregious fool. But fools who said no have contributed much to the advancement of human dignity. Such as it is. I suppose it'd be crazy if I didn't-- I mean, it's a fortune! I'm just wondering what-- Hey, what will people say? Personally, I don't intend to tell a soul. Think of how many people's faces you could spit in. Okay? Yes. - I'll take it! - Congratulations. Gosh! I've never seen a hundred-dollar boll. I don't know what to say. I-- I'm really completely at a loss for words. That's surely never happened to you before. No. I know I talk a lot, but now-- I can't say anything other than "Thank you". It sounds terribly silly. It sounds very nice to me the way you said it. Oh, no, it's far too little. Just "Thank you". 15 weeks of security and... all for free. I just don't know what to say. I feel abundantly rewarded. By what? By the sparkle in your eyes. You know, for me there are consequences attached. Why? Gratitude. The burning desire to repay you someday. Somehow. Yes, but it's a gift, not a loan. Yes, but that's what I mean by consequences. You forget a loan as soon as you pay it off. For a gift, you're always beholden. I wish to never again hear anything from you neither in person nor by telephone or in writing or by carrier pigeon. Understood? And that little girl you make such nasty remarks about is worth as much as 50 of your kind. Oh my God. When I show this to Vicky and tell her what happened, she's really gonna faint. You don't think she'll misunderstand? 600 dollars? Nobody can misunderstand that much. Besides, Vicky knows full well I would never do such things. And she's a good girl herself. That's why we live together. And the man with the Cadillac who studied in England? Oh, that's all very sad and hopeless. They sometimes go to sensual movies together and hold hands. His wife's blood pressure is much too low. Or who knows. Maybe it's much too high? Well, anyway, she has bad health. He doesn't strike me as very robust himself. Oh, you. If two people don't immediately sleep with each other... I think you're awful! There! I don't like the tone with which you said that. - Why? - It sounded patronizing, condescending, and maternal. You just offered to let me mother you. Don't you like it when I kiss you? Oh yes, very much, in fact. But without "there". Oh, you're too spoiled. Wouldn't you have felt silly if I'd said "there"? Maybe you're right. Shall we try it again? Better? Not especially. It wasn't patronizing or maternal. This time it was daughterly. Wasn't it fatherly of you to give me all that money? You're too logical. That's not becoming to the young. Either way. You're sweet. Well, I am flabbergasted. Oh my God. You've sure gotten wet! What were you doing? Standing around in the rain? You're right. She's worth at least 50 of my kind. Cynthia, go to your room. I think you'll need a referee, Daddy. Cynthia! Go to your room! Anything you say, Daddy. She's really going! I sure as hell shouldn't have left you two alone. We don't want to just throw out the baby with the bath water. Things are very different from how they look. I've got eyes in my head. It was obvious. Well, the obvious is frequently ambiguous. Take our Patty, for example-- No, you take her and keep her. Oh! Thank you. We have his blessing! Oh, Don, stop being so horrible and stuffy already! Okay, fine, I was sitting on his lap and kissing him. Is that a crime? Dear God, I swear, I'll never kiss a man again as long as I live. That wouldn't be such a bad idea for you. Don! Don't you want an explanation of what happened? Why we came up here, why you found me in this situation-- Will that change anything? How or why? I think so. You see, Mr. Slater asked me to marry him. Marry? He asked you to marry him? That's right. I hope, Mr. Slater, you don't mind that I told him that. That's none of his damn business. Forgive me if I interrupted this touching proposal. Oh, he proposed a long time ago already. Yeah, sure. Kneeling in front of the couch, I imagine. As a matter of fact, it was in the bathroom, and he even wanted to go down on his knee, if you want to know every detail. Didn't you, Mr. Slater? - Boy's honor. - See? What did you actually mix into the steak sauce? Yohimbine? I wish you both lots of happiness. Poor Don. What ever is he thinking? Hard to tell with such a clean-minded young man. They conceive of the vilest things. Darn! Now he probably thinks I'm just a little cow. I wouldn't worry about it. But I do. He still doesn't know why I sat on your lap and kissed you. If you have any brains in your head, he'll never know. Do you mind if I borrow this? Not in the slightest. I just wouldn't want him to think I'm that type of girl. Do you believe he thinks that now? I couldn't blame him. He has reason for suspicion. Then follow my advice! Don't dispel it. - What? - The suspicion. Uncertainty. "Did she or didn't she?" "Will she or won't she?" "Does she or doesn't she?" Doubt. Suspicion. The most powerful binding agent. Stronger than any aphrodisiac in the world. Gesundheit. Thank you. Kleenex? Thank you. Why are you such an idiot, standing around in the rain? What were you talking about so long anyway, you and Cynthia? Mostly about you. About me? I told her exactly how we met and why you came up here and offered to cook and-- ...and what a nice girl you are. Were. I mean, seemed to be. - Surely she didn't believe it. - No. She said, "I know the type. Sounds like a professional virgin." How mean to say such a thing! I thought so, too. We had a hefty fight about it. And? Go on? That's all. But I didn't know where I would find you... And in what state. Necking with Mr. Slater. No one used the word "necking"! But you were getting along with him pretty well, weren't you? Yes, I adore him. Too bad you had to come trampling in just at that tender moment! I wish Al Smith would've stuck to politics. Who? Al Smith. Who's that? The builder of the Empire State Building. Oh. Oh, I see. Yeah, but he really couldn't help it. We could've met anywhere. Say, do you always go around and kiss every Fritz, Franz, and Otto? Yes, yes. Always. - Well, you kissed him! - Yes, I did. Yeah, a complete stranger! Rubbish! He had dinner with us. I've known him almost as long as I've known you! I suppose he-- h-h-he was being tender with you. Of course! Like mad! - How could you even doubt it? - I don't. Tender. With the girl you picked up. Who was wearing your robe and had your dinner in her stomach! Oh, Don... Be sensible. Let me explain to you what really happened. What will that change? It's just a shame. I really thought you were a good girl. I seriously thought that. You don't think so anymore? Not anymore now. Mr. Slater still thinks so. That's probably why he asked me to marry him. Don't you believe that either? I don't believe he ever asked you to do that. I didn't believe it when you first told me or when you tried to get him to confirm it and I believe it now even less. Why not? Because I know David Slater. Yeah, if you'd told me he wanted to get you to have an affair with him, that I would've believed. You're horrible! My God, don't start to cry. Cynthia prepared me for this trick. - She said professional virgins-- - I'm going! Okay. - Back upstairs to Slater's? - Yes, yes I am! Some unfinished business, eh? Yes! - Your name's Donald Gresham? - Yes. Where do you think you are? What are you doing here? Who are you? How dare you simply trample into a stranger's apartment? Who are you? Wait a second! Don't come in! Good evening! Is Mr. Gresham available? Not at the moment. He can't talk anymore. So she beat him. With my electric iron! Oh, Pop... Pop, what have you done?! Oh, it was you! Did you have a reason? Only my duty, as any father would have done. Ah, so you just broke his neck. He'll come to. 35 years on the force and you know just how hard to hit a man. Leave him alone already! Are you all right? How did you even know I was here? Did you call him? Me? Heaven forbid... But then how could you-- It was a twist of fate that I called your apartment. Your friend Vicky told me where you could be found. That Vicky! If she could just keep her big mouth shut... Visiting a bachelor in his apartment! Oh, Pop, you don't understand! He wasn't even trying-- I know it must give the completely wrong impression, but can't you conceive that a man like Don would never do a thing. He's an architect! We'll talk later! Come now. We're going! I've told you again and again - that the wages of sin are only despair! - Pop, please not now! Not here! May I ask you something, sir? Wouldn't you have done what I did if you had found your daughter in a man's bedroom? That's an interesting question, Mr. O'Neill... a very interesting question. Thank you, sir. Jolly good night. Come on. We're going. But Pop, we can't just leave the poor man lying there like that. Quiet. Here. But he didn't do anything! He wanted-- Give him the water. Come on. We're going. Mr. Slater, do something! Fear not, pal. The avenging father has gone and taken his little daughter with him. Oh... That eye is looking grisly, though! I've never experienced something so outrageous. Don't come to me if you want sympathy. You deserved that lesson. With interest. What? I'm sorry if you're in pain of course, but let's be honest. O'Neill is perfectly justified! Oh, I-- I wish you'd do something about that horrible eye. I-- I can't look at stuff like that. I'll have him kicked off the police force, that cretin jackboot, that flatfoot. He may be a cretin, he may have flat feet. But he's a father. He would've been justified to kill you. And I would've been, too, as Cynthia's father. There's no free license for hunting seducers here. The unwritten law protects us fathers! The unwritten law?! You've-- I grant you, if it were written, people would know better where they stand. But the principle remains set in stone. Man has the right to protect his daughter. One could almost say the duty. Yes, sir! The good, simple man taught me a lesson. A high moral enlightenment. Get lost. Go away, if you please. Poor little Cynthia. What she must have suffered. What she must have endured. At your brutal hand. You're breaking my heart. Go away. Don't be cynical as well. There's more joy in heaven over one repentant sinner-- Kindly repent in your own apartment!

Well, what should I want? - To talk to you, of course! - What about? I can't tell you in two seconds and-- and surely not as long as I'm standing out here in the hall. Why not? All right, I came back to ask you what Cynthia actually means when she calls me a professional virgin! Shh! You don't call on people at this hour! I know. I'd have come back earlier, but it took me loads of time to get rid of my father. We had an awful row. Blue in the face from anger. You should have seen it. Thanks, I did. I saw the first show. That eye really looks dreadful. My pop says-- The less I have to hear about your father, the better. I've read a lot about police brutality, but it never caught my eye before. It's dribbling all down your robe. Come, I'll-- Don't make a fuss. It's all right. You should put a piece of raw steak on it. Police trick. If you hadn't invited Slater to dinner, there might still be some steak left over. Oh, Don, look, I'm terribly sorry that my father decked you. But he's old-fashioned and merely did his duty. Oh, that bump looks really nasty. It's just an old-fashioned duty bump. Enough of that, it's getting late. What else is on your mind? Don't stare at me so angrily. When you stare at me so angrily I can't possibly discuss things with you. I'm willing to forgo any further discussion. I'm also willing to forget the whole story like a bad dream. The whole story? From beginning to end. Yes, who is it? Darling, have you tried aluminum diacetate on your eye? It's the best thing-- Listen, Cynthia, will you stop calling now, for heaven's sake? But I only wanted to know if-- - Cynthia, you will hang up at once! - But Daddy! If you refuse to obey me, you'll see what happens! You will hang up at once! What did she want? She's overflowing with sympathy for my eye. At this time of night? May I remind you, that you even showed up here in person at this time of night? You're very tired, eh? It was a hard day for me. If Cynthia came down now and chirped around you a little - and fussed over your eye-- - Not another word about Cynthia, please! She called me a professional virgin! And that's bugging me! I only came back to talk to you about that. Not about Cynthia. Don't worry. Only about this phrase of hers. It was just a somewhat poorly chosen phrase and I was angry about it. May I ask you something? What does Cynthia have against virgins? Look, Patty, nobody even halfway in their right mind can seriously take the word "virgin" as an insult. Not "virgin", but "professional". It makes me furious and I want an explanation. Why "professional"? It's not really necessary to advertise it. That's all the phrase means. Why is advertising bad? People who advertise something aim at selling it. Oh, that's what it means. I can understand that. Maybe I really am spouting off about it too much. Ah, stop spouting off about it. Oh well... You're right. Don? Do you believe in fate? Hmm? I mean, what would've happened if it hadn't rained like crazy and-- And you'd just taken me out to dinner as we'd planned. We'd have probably had a more conventional evening. True. We just took the wrong train, it seems to me. Anyway, we wouldn't be sitting here now and-- Oh my God! Th-th-that can't be your father again, can it? I don't know! Hey! Hey! Here! Come in here! No, no, not you again! Are you aware what time it is? I am precisely and that's precisely why I'm here. You're not to be chitchatting with my daughter on the phone at this hour. I came down especially to tell you that. Kindly tell her that. She called me. My dear boy, I have told her that. Until I was blue in the face. But I cant get one step further. She laughs at me. I talked myself hoarse. To no avail. And what's worse, I-- I ran out of material. Say, don't you yourself think it's rather late to act like a huffing father? You know, Cynthia said that to me, too! It shut me up. A direct hit. Listen, I'd like to go to bed. Leave, if you please. Leave. I was just thinking of that myself. Leaving. Going away. Far away. Away from here. Yes, sir! I have decided to take Cynthia down to Brazil. Down to her mother! - A good idea. - A brilliant idea! - It'll do her good to learn Portuguese. - Yeah. - I should have thought of it years ago. - Yeah. I'll book the-- the flight reservations right now. May I use your phone? You've got your own phone upstairs. Yeah. I had one. Yeah. But just now as Cynthia wanted to call you, I ripped the goddamned thing out of the wall. I had to take this girl out of circulation. Yes, sir! If more fathers would rip more phones out of more walls, then more girls would be safeguarded from disgrace. I-it's only a local call. Whatever. But make it quick. Do you happen to know the number for Pan American? - No. - Never mind. I'll find it out. From information. Say, do you have a party line? No. Oh, you completely rotten, lying, conscience-proof, no-good hypocrite, you. Let the devil-- You've got that girl in there. - I-- I recognized her voice. - You don't know what you're saying, you-- - Patty? - Just a sec, I'm on the phone! All right. Wipe that grin off your face. I told her to hide in there. She was just going. I didn't know who was at the door, and I didn't want to cause her embarrassment. You pillar of virtue. I gotta hand it to you. You outdid me. Seems like I'm going downhill. Well, didn't that homicidal father cool your ardor one bit? He would've trampled the last scraps of libido out of me, I can tell you. Slater, you're completely mistaken. Patty just dropped by for a moment - in her quaint fashion-- - Look. Why don't the two of us stop fooling each other? I'm not sitting here in moral judgment, after all. Neither of you nor of her. I'm a little disappointed. Maybe I'm even a little disillusioned. Pity. Seemed like such a nice girl. Tell her for me I'd actually hoped she would've given it at least 15 weeks. Why 15 weeks? She'll underst-- She certainly will. How dare you say a thing like that? You're no better than Don. I think you're awful. I didn't think you would have any doubts. What happened to your respect for innocence now? In all seriousness, against all appearances, I feel it coming back. Oh, Slater, go home now already! You leave him to me. I haven't even started - to tell him what I think yet. - Now, now, now, calm down. Don't say or do anything you would regret later. I think I really jumped to the wrong conclusion. You said there were no consequences attached to it. I thought you meant it seriously. - I did, though. - No. I'm sure you wouldn't've just thought anything wrong of me if I hadn't taken the money. What? What money? I never should have taken it, and now I wish to give it back to you. Could someone kindly explain to me what in the world you're talking about here? I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to Mr. Slater about the money he gave me. What in blazes did he give you money for? I don't know. Ask him. I have no idea. You gave her money? My dear thing, you have an unerring talent for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. You should enter the diplomatic service. That's why I was kissing him. In gratitude. In gratitude for a gift of 600 dollars. 600 dollars? He says he won it in poker. From a bloated capitalist who lives off the sweat of the poor. What's so funny about that? He won it from me. That's my 600 bucks! Okay, then you take it. Nonsense. It's his money. I insist you take it back. Mr. Slater, please. Boy scouts are obligated to do to do a good deed every day. They must have crummy days. I wonder why it is that young men are always cautioned against bad girls. Anyone can handle a bad girl. But a good girl... Men ought to be warned about that. You're so right. I'd like a drink. Your best idea so far. I thought you considered it high school to drink unless you actually craved it. That's right. I crave it now. Soda or tap water? - Straight. - Say when. When. Isn't that a bit too much? No. Haven't we parented the poor girl enough for one night? Don't you start getting fatherly now, too. Bottoms up, my baby. Cigarette? Yes, thanks. I'll take one. Seems you're really going high school. This man seems hard to please. Grumbles when you're immoral, grumbles when you're chaste... Slater. For the last time, go home already! Gladly. Do you want to come with? If you really want to be immoral, I'd be the last to talk you out of it. Really? We'd have to be very discrete, of course. I wouldn't want your father to get any ideas. But I know a cute little apartment. Fine. Can I have a maid? Sure. And a Cadillac. With that button? You don't play the part well, Patty. You'd better stick to your beer commercials. Good night. Why does he deliberately act differently than he is? Just to hurt me. Young men in love are always cruel. In love... We've done nothing but fight! He's suffering, too. Believe me. I'm fed up with always being nothing but a... A... The status to which you are referring seldom lasts forever. There comes a time, my child, when you must follow your feminine instincts. Where the heart is more precious than virtue. I know. But we've only known one another such a short time. Long enough to know what you want. You're a nice kid, Patty. A sweet kid. Don't ruin anything for yourself through false pride. But won't he lose all respect for me if... If I... For a gift, one is always beholden. Good night, Patty. Did you lease this machine? Why were you in such a terrible hurry? What? Last night. You knocked on my door. Yes, I know. I wasn't sure whether you heard it. I heard it. I was shaving at the moment. At 1:00 in the morning? Right. By the time I had wiped off the lather and came to the door, you'd vanished like smoke. I know. Why did you knock? Why were you shaving? How'd you even know I was up here? Oh, I didn't. Not for sure. I was in your office and your secretary told me you ran off without saying a word. Somehow I couldn't quite work. She said you were in an ugly temper. Why did you tell her you ran into a door? Because I don't expect that she's particularly interested in my love life. On the contrary. She was fascinated. I told her everything from A to Z. That's just like you. She's a terribly nice person. And she has needles in that little box under-- Were you able to sleep last night? No. Not particularly. There wasn't much night left anymore. I didn't sleep a wink, and I haven't eaten a thing all day. How dumb of you. Why? You should know why! Because of you! I was thinking about you, imagining what insane thing you'd do next, imagining-- I-I-I-- I nearly lost my mind when you were suddenly gone. I didn't even have your phone number! Don't worry. I have yours. Accepting money from a man like Slater... Listen, Don. I've been thinking, too. About that 600 dollars. Can you even afford to lose that much money? Isn't it a shame to gamble for such a high amount? I would bet that was your whole month's salary. Does an architect even have a salary? One way or another. I think you could do something - more reasonable with it! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Will you kindly keep your lovely mouth shut? We're not married yet. Yeah, but w-- What? What did you say? I said we're not married yet. That's what I heard, too. You want to know what I thought when you smiled at me in front of that jewelry shop yesterday? I did not smile until we were up here. I thought to myself, "That is exactly the smile I'd like to wake up to every morning." Really? When you were fixing dinner and then when you were flirting so outrageously with Mr. Slater, I-- Are you proposing to me, by any chance? What else? What else can I say? You could say, "I love you." In three words. Without all the shilly-shallying. Haven't I done that yet? No. And I'd like to hear it. I-- I want the real thing, with all the trimmings. An proper honest-to-goodness old-fashioned proposal. Do you know how my father proposed to my mother? Probably gave her a black eye. Now I can't tell you, of course. You wouldn't believe me. Anyway, he wasn't embarrassed to come out and say, "I love you." I'd like to at least have given you that hint. Okay, but please don't prompt me now. I love you, Patty. I love you very much, in fact. Even though you are a little bit nuts. And I'll hang the Picasso in the bedroom. - Not in our bedroom! - Okay. Do they let children up here at half price? No idea. Why? I think it would be a nice idea if we always came up here on our anniversaries. But with five kids, it would be too expensive. We can check them downstairs at the cloakroom. No. I'd like them to see it. I'm so glad that Al Smith built this roof. Our roof. There. Did you mind when I said, "there"? What? Oh, nothing. You're very sweet. To think, $1.20 just to ride to the top of an old building. THE END A PREMINGER-HERBERT PRODUCTION A UNITED ARTISTS RELEASE
