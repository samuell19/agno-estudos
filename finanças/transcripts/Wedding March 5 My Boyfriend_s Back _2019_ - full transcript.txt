Since the second grade. Wow, that's a long time. I know. And we wouldn't have known each other if it wasn't for baseball. Baseball? What do you mean? Annalise's dad was a huge fan. First present he ever got her was a ball and a bat. The minute they moved to town, he signed her up for the all-boys team. First girl ever. That's how you met, on the team? We didn't exactly meet. She took me out sliding into home plate. It was pretty impressive. Brad didn't think a girl could slide, so I figured he had it coming. [laughs] Anyway, against all odds, we were inseparable. Why do you say "against all odds?" I've always been focused, all about sticking to the plan, sometimes to a fault. But Brad is charming, fun, all about go with the flow. Yeah, how so? Well, for instance, I knew I wanted to go to college, have a career. All Brad wanted to do is climb, kayak, that kind of thing. [laughs] He always said life was his college. But even though we were different, somehow we always just clicked. Wherever we went, the strangest things happened. Like, the world was there to entertain just the two of us. Even the simplest things were special, as long as we did them together. And no one made me laugh like Brad. [laughs] No one's ever really believed in me like Annalise. And what happened then? She got this great opportunity right after college to work for this high-end event planning company. Brad didn't know what he was going to do in New York, and there's not many mountains to climb in the city. No. But we decided to get our own apartments in New York, and keep dating, and on the day we were supposed to move, he broke up with me. Did he say why? He did, but it didn't really make any sense, and here we are. Do you still have feelings for him? It's over. He made that clear. Yeah, Mick and I broke up in college. Took us 20 years to reconnect. Wow. I... I didn't realize that. Are we interrupting anything? Hi. Absolutely not. Ready to see who sits where? Wow, color-coded and everything. Exciting! Oh, um, this is the schedule that I will be putting in your welcome bags. That's awesome. I will take that as a compliment, especially from a graphic designer.

All right, Mister Milky Milk Moon Bars expert, what is missing? I don't know, they just tasted better. Oh. Well, why didn't you tell me that earlier because I was just down at the market and I got a big bottle of better, so if I sprinkle some of that on there and then that'll make everything better. Give me a break here, will you? This is a big day. If we're gonna do Milky Milk Moon Bars, we gotta do it right. [sighs] I order cut Calla lilies for the table arrangement, and I get dozens of Stephanotis in pots instead. Ooh, brownies. Hey. Uh, well these are... Burnt. And nasty. Yeah. And, uh, don't you have a cake tasting in a while? Uh, two hours from now. Oh, well, I mean, given that these are no good, we, uh, we might as well just throw these out. I'll take care of that for you. [sighs] Don't you think Mick is acting a little weird lately? Well, no more than usual. Brought you some lemonade. Thanks, I already have something. Okay. No, wait. Um, this isn't any old lemonade. Is that so? Yeah, this is my special apology lemonade. Apologade. You must not make that very often. No, no, I really don't. Um, but when I do, one sip and you are guaranteed to forget that you were ever mad at me. Hmm. Must be strong stuff. Very. Very strong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I called you rigid. And stubborn. Yep, that too. A little lemonade never hurt anybody. Good. Just gonna leave this here and return to my cozy little doghouse. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! It’s okay, it's alright.

I mean, with the schedules. Right. Thanks. You know, picking out stationery isn't all it's cracked out to be. You can still back out if you want. Back out? Of stationery picking? I am not dumb, I know a good time when I see one. Okay. You asked for it. Thank you. What is a welcome bag, anyway? Well, it's an important wedding essential given to each and every guest when they arrive. Ergo the name "welcome bag." Exactly. Right. But in keeping with the theme of upscale country, Jen and Lucas's bag will be a small basket. You have my attention, I'm listening. Well, a welcome bag often contains a schedule of the events, small snacks, and in this case, a river rafting coupon. River rafting? What company? Uh, Black River Rafting? We partner with them sometimes. It really is such a small world. Okay, we need to focus please. Yes. Uh, we have schedules to print- Schedules. - And fonts to choose. - Fonts to choose. Fonts are a very important part in setting the tone. Yes, obviously. Wouldn't want to stray from the upscale country theme or people will be wildly confused. I agree completely.

So, here's my plan. I'm thinking we'd have dinner here, then I'd put on maybe his favorite music, a little candlelight, and then we'll give him his album. But don't you think he'll see you setting up? Well, I thought you could keep him occupied. Well, that's a lot of occupying. Um, what do you think about doing this in the barn? The barn? Yeah, because that way he won't see you getting ready, and at the perfect moment, I bring him down there and you give him the photo album. Hmm. I like that. Yeah. You really don't think Mick's been acting weird lately? Like, just now. He's not doing something, is he? I mean there's no way he could remember a first-date anniversary, right?

There's no way she knows. You're sure? I'm positive. So how do you like New York? I love it. Oh, good. Glad it all worked out. Thanks. Can't believe you're starting your own business. Yeah, it's crazy. Can we get two coffees, please? Well, it looks like the wedding's going to be a smashing success. I hope so. Are they all destination weddings like this? Well, actually, that's how I'm trying to position myself, you know, my niche. Yeah, that's a good idea. What about your business? Or, I should say businesses. Oh, well, it's going all right. It's going really well, strangely enough. Tell me more. Well, we got nine full-time guys, and ten part-timers. That's a lot. Yeah. Who's your biggest clientele? We do a lot of excursions with private parties, but our main bread and butter is corporate trips. That's great, Brad. Yeah.

Wonderful, actually. Oh, good. Okay. I gotta try it sometime. Do you remember the guy you introduced me to before you left? The one with the advertising agency? Yeah. He's my first client. Turns out he was really into these motivational events for his employees, and he knew a bunch of other companies that were, too. Really? You knew that. Maybe. I knew it. Well, I guess Buckley Adventures has you to thank for being what it is today. No, that's all you, Brad. Seriously, your success doesn't surprise me. It surprised everybody else. Well, then shame on them. Are you dating? Not really. Can't seem to get past the dreaded third date. Lucky if I make it to the third date. You know what, I'm just gonna come out and I'm gonna say it. I am so sorry for breaking up with you on the day that we were moving to New York. That was horrible. Yeah, it was pretty bad. I know. You never did give me a good explanation why you broke up with me. I don't know. Uh, it was a long time ago. You know? Yeah. It was. I heard that you lost six-months rent at that apartment. Served me right. I'm sorry I didn't talk to you for five years. Yeah, that was pretty bad, too. I know. It's nice hanging out like this. Yeah. I really missed you. I missed you too. You did? Of course. It is so stupid that we let all this time go by. I know. And there's no reason why, you know, we can't... Be friends. Friends, yeah. Yeah. Friends would be a good thing. That's a, that's a good thing. I'm sorry this is so last minute, my cousin's not too up on wedding etiquette. It's fine, it happens.

We love them, but that side of the family isn't the best at RSVP’ing, either. Just count them as a no. Okay. Hey. Getting that seating arrangement figured out? Hey, yeah, it's all set. Good. Listen, how do you think you and Brad would feel about a little fishing tomorrow while the ladies are at their dress fitting? I'm down. I know Brad will be. Thanks, Mick. Okay, they've been gone for three hours. I wouldn't read too much into it. It's a good sign. I don't care what you say. What's a good sign? Jen is convinced that there might be a chance for Brad and Annalise. I know he broke her heart, but now that I've seen her around him, I... Yeah, I don't disagree. See, it's not impossible. Well, I guess love makes anything possible. Well, I can't argue with that. Aww. Let's keep our fingers crossed, then. Hey. Hi, guys. Hi. Did you figure something out for the schedules? Yep. Crisis averted. Are we all set with the seating chart? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all done. Great. I'll let the caterer know that we'll have one more. Okay. I'm going to get some rest. I had a good time. Yeah, me too. [quietly] Night. [loudly] Goodnight. Goodnight. Night, Lise. Goodnight, guys. Goodnight. Night, bud. Night. I thought she said she wanted to be friends. She did, she did, but I'm still confused. Why? I can't tell if she said that because that's what she wants, or because that's what she thinks that I want. You're right, that is confusing. Yeah. What do you want? I'm not sure I get a vote, man. Why not? Because I burned her once, Mick. I'm not sure I get a second chance. Trust me, it happens. Yeah, I don't know, I don't really know where she's at. I figure it best to just leave it alone, see what happens. Yeah. That's what I felt with Olivia, too. So I did leave it alone. And then I blinked and 20 years went by. ♪ [chuckles] [knocks at door] Knock knock. Oh, hi. You ready for the dress fitting? Oh my gosh, I am so sorry, I must've lost track of time. Oh, it's fine. We still have a few minutes. Are those of you and Mick? Yes. Look at this. [laughs] Oh. Look at you guys. I know, so young. It's funny, when I look at him, I still see the same guy I fell in love with. It's amazing that you guys got back together. Yeah, yeah, it was a long road, but oh, it is amazing. There really is nothing like your first love, is there? No, there isn't. Oh! Ah! I love it. Really? It's perfect. You look beautiful. You think Lucas will like it? How could he not? I've been dreaming about this day since I was a little girl. A few more days. I'm so happy for you. Thanks. Okay. I'll be right out, and it's onto the salon. I can't wait. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just thought maybe you were putting on a strong front for Jen. Am I that easy to read? [laughs] Yes. So, is it Brad? We decided to be friends last night. Oh. You don't sound too happy about that. I don't know. I think I still have feelings for him. It's a lot more complicated the second time around, isn't it? How did you two even get back together? It wasn't easy, I'll tell you that. And I was engaged at the time, which made things really difficult. I feel like we're so protected now. It's like we're constantly talking in code or something. Yeah. I remember that, too. But eventually you told him how you felt? Yeah, I did, eventually. Weren't you scared? I was, I was terrified. I mean, why do you think we're not engaged after two years? You're still not sure? Oh no, no, I'm sure now. I mean, I'm just... just saying, it's taken time. I don't know how he feels about me. Ugh. It's a lot to wrap my head around. It is, it is. Maybe you should just take it one step at a time. Yeah, yeah. And the first step is telling him how I feel. Yes. Because if you don't, won't you always wonder? Yeah. Yeah. [sighs] [sports game playing] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no! Yeah, yeah, yes! Yes! No! He called it. No! I told you he was duped. Hey, guys. Hi. I'm no expert, but this sure doesn't look like fishing to me. [laughs] Fishing didn't really work out. Are you saying that because we didn't catch a single fish? [laughs] Or the fact that somebody fell in trying to catch the fish? No. I never thought that lake water could be so cold in the summer. You look nice. Why thank you, husband to be. Sorry we took so long but after the fitting at the dress shop we just figured we just had to stop off for a mani-pedi, too. Ooh, nice. Ooh. Very nice. Thank you. You got a minute? I want to show you something. Uh, yeah? Good. Let's go. [phone beeps] Uh, Lucas? [laughs] Oh no. Yeah. [laughs] Wow. When did you do all this? I got the lion's share done last night. Last night? When? I don't know. Around 3:00 in the morning? Couldn't sleep. Something on your mind? Yeah, actually. I was hoping that we could talk. Really? Me too, actually. Oh. About what? Uh. Well, you go first. Right, um. Well, I was thinking a lot about what you said about us being friends. Yeah. Hey, sorry, but we, uh, we need to talk. Oh, yeah, what's up? I just heard from my cousin. Yeah, the Flannigan cousin who never RSVP'd? They're coming. Wait, they're? All ten of 'em. I'm so, so, sorry. But first Brandon decided to come, and then Colin decided he'd come because Brandon was coming, and then suddenly all the other cousins are coming too. [laughs] Look, I know you've got the menu and the seating all figured out, but... They're really laid back. I mean, we can just tell them to grab a bite to eat before the reception, that way we don't have to mess up the seating chart, or the caterer. They can bring their own drinks, you know, like BYOB. You know, maybe I'll... I'll just tell them they can't come. No, don't worry. We will figure it out. I... I don't want this to stress you out. It's your wedding. You're the one who shouldn't stress, okay? We will make it work. Didn't I tell you? You're the best. Aww. Really, thank you. No problem. Thanks. Okay. [sighs] So, isn't everyone coming tomorrow? Yeah, mm-hmm. What are you going to do? Not BYOB, that's for sure. [sighs] Were you able to find extra rooms for the Flannigans? Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, so we have six at the Overland B&B, and four at the Hansen's Inn down the road. Great. Would you happen to have two more antique tablecloths? Yes, yes. Thanks for the reminder, I think I do. Perfect. I just got off the phone with the rental place. Oh great, what did they say? Well, they have two tables and ten chairs, but the chairs don't match what we have. [sighs] That's not good. I'm gonna call Party Pros, hopefully they're not all reserved. (Olivia) Yeah. (Annalise) Oh, and I have to call the caterer right away. You know, I'll call Party Pros. Yeah, your plate's full enough as it is. Really? Oh. No problem. Thank you. That's nice. That's so great. What is it? I don't think it's going to work. What are you talking about? The generator. It's broken. Broken? Well, it can't be broken. We have to have the lights. Well then, maybe you can fix it. I'll show you. Now? We're a little busy in case you haven't noticed. (Duke) I know, but we're also running out of time. And I've looked into getting a new generator shipped, but if you need it for the anniversary, it's not gonna make it on time. (Mick) Yes, I need it for the anniversary. That's the whole point. Do you have any suggestions? Don't look over there right now. [laughs] I told you... I told you not to look over there. Sorry. All right, I trust you completely. Will you please handle this? Don't give it another thought. Hi, this is Mick Turner over at the Willow Lake Inn. Yeah, I was wondering if you had any extra chairs for this Saturday. Yeah, I know it's a little short notice. Okay. I'm gonna go look for the table cloths. Thanks. You know, I... I just left a bunch of messages for the caterers, but I hate to do it, but I think I'm going to have to call their private number. That's okay, I mean you don't really have much of a choice. Don't worry, we are going to make it work. I hope so. [sighs] Hi, it's Annalise, um, I hate to call you on your private line, but I've got a hiccup. Yeah, we're going to have ten more people. Yeah, ten. Okay, well, if you could call me as soon as you know, I'd really appreciate that. Thank you, bye bye. Everything okay? Well, the caterer doesn't seem too happy, but what's up? Just checking in, seeing if there's anything I can do. Thanks, but not really. You sure? I could run out and get some hot dogs, beach chairs. Change the theme from upscale country to downscale beach. Hmm. I have a feeling that's not going to work. All right. I'm sure it'll work out, things always do. Uh, I know things always work out for you, but I can't just fly by the seat of my pants. I plan things. I know. But it's not going to help things to get stressed out about it, either. It is what it is. Adding ten more people might not seem like a big deal to you, but it puts a wrench in everything. It's chairs, Lisy. And some tables, and some food. It's not that big of a deal if you don't let it be. Sorry, but I'm not like you. I don't see life like one long day at the park, Brad. It's not one long to-do list, either. [sighs] I'm sorry, I didn't want to stress you out more. No, it's fine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some calls to make. Yeah. Mm-hmm. [dialing] I can't... Hi. It's Annalise Collins. I've got a problem. ♪ [laughing] Oh my gosh, it's always great getting to meet the parents of the bride and the groom. Well, Jen's had nothing but great things to say about the Inn, and her wedding planners. All true. Oh, thank you, I appreciate it. We have had so much fun working with Lucas and Jen. We're looking forward to taking advantage of the area over the next couple days. We, uh, we love to hike. Oh, you'll have plenty of time to do that before the rehearsal dinner. Great, well, let's uh, check out the welcome party. Follow me. (Olivia) Nice to meet you guys. Have fun. Hi. The welcome party is on the outside patio, and all the events are in the schedule. And most importantly, have fun. [phone buzzes] Oh, if you'll excuse me. This is Annalise. Really? Nothing? Okay. I understand. Thank you. Is everything okay? We still don't have chairs. I hate how last minute this is. Don't worry, though. We will find a place that has everything we need. Well, I hope we find it before it's too late. Annalise. This is, uh... Cameron. Cameron. He was looking for you. Annalise. Great to finally meet you in the flesh. Yes, Cameron. Oh, sorry, Cameron Clarkson. Clarkson Group? We're interested in your new company. Of course. [forced laugh] That's great, you're here. I thought the best way to evaluate your work would be to see it first-hand. I hope you can find room for me at the Inn. Hi, I'm Olivia. Mick and I own the Inn, and we will find you a room no problem. Yeah, no problem at all. Thank you. It's a great venue. Oh, thank you. I'd love to see more. Get the tour, maybe get caught up on your plans for the weekend. Sure. Why don't you help yourself to a drink at the welcome party, and I'll join you in a minute or two? Looking forward to it. Nice meeting you. I can't believe this is happening. Did you know he was gonna be here? I had no idea. I don't have time for this. What, are you kidding? Go do what you need to do. But I have... No, no, no, we will handle it all. Go, go, go. Okay, so we need to divvy up everything that we need to do. All right, give me a list of what you need me to do. Okay. I think I have an idea. We've been very impressed with the other weddings you've been involved with. Thank you. I really do love my work. Hey, sorry to interrupt. I'm Brad Buckley, I'm the best man. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. This is Cameron, he's interested in my company. Oh, fun. And I was just going to give him a tour of the Inn, so. Great. Did Annalise mention the, um, river rafting coupons she included in all the welcome baskets? Um, no. she hasn't. But I like that idea. Combining a destination wedding with the local events? Thanks, I like the guests to feel like they get a full experience, even beyond the wedding. Exactly. I know I'd love it if I were a guest. Good. Well, uh, how about we go on that tour? The reason I mentioned the, uh, coupon is because I run an expedition company myself. In fact, we partner with Black River Rafting a lot. I'd be happy to take you on a private rafting tour, if you're interested. There's also some really great hiking trails I could show you. River rafting sounds fun, but I hear the hiking is beautiful around here. Oh, it is, Cam. Let me tell you. You know what, we actually have plenty of time today if you want to go for a quick hike. That way we can save the river rafting for tomorrow. If that's okay with you, of course. Absolutely. Good. Why don't you show me around, and we'll talk a little business, and then I'll meet you in an hour? Yeah, sounds good, Cameron. Great. The chairs just got here. Thanks for checking in. Okay, bye-bye. Hey! How was river rafting? Fantastic. Brad was a perfect guide. I can't wait to do it again. I'm so glad. Nicely done. Well, I gotta go get cleaned up. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, it's not a problem. Did you get everything sorted? Yep. Thanks for keeping Cameron occupied. I think you scored me some extra brownie points, too. Good. I'm sorry I was so... Hey, it's okay. I know this whole thing means a lot to you. It's all right. Yeah. It's hard to believe that tonight's the rehearsal dinner already. Feels like it's been such a whirlwind. It has. Okay. I'm going to go get cleaned up, I'll see you tonight. Okay. Uh, Brad? Yeah? Thanks again. I really do appreciate it. Like I said, it's not a problem. I double checked with the caterer. Well, good. What did he say? He said he could cover the ten extra plates, plus one for my investor. Oh, great. Yeah. Looks like everything's working out, believe it or not. Everything? I feel bad. I was just caught up in everything, I didn't give Brad a chance. Don't you think he understands that? I do, but in a way, it just makes it worse. Why? I don't know, Olivia. He said something that really made me think. What's that? Basically that I look at life like a chore, and it just made me realize how different we are. Yeah, but you know what they say. Opposites attract. Yeah, but there's a reason he broke up with me. Maybe it's just not meant to be. Is that what you want? [tearfully] No. But it's like he used to say, you can't force things to happen, no matter how much you want it. Come here. [playing acoustic guitar] ♪ [singing under his breath] ♪ Hey. That's a cool song, did you write it? Olivia and I wrote that. First song we ever wrote together. Might be the most romantic thing I've ever heard in my life, Mick. [laughs] Yeah. Why did you let Olivia go when you were in college? I'm sorry, that's none of my business. No, it's a good question. I was... I was young and stupid. I guess you could say I was so full of myself, I couldn't see her. I regretted letting go of her for a long time, still do. You're lucky, you know. You guys ended up together even after you broke up. Well, I don't know how much luck has to do with it. What do you mean? Well, we worked at it, you know. It's not always a fairy tale, but there are such things as happy endings. So this may be none of my business, but why did you let Annalise go? I didn't want to. What do you mean? Annalise was so full of dreams and plans. She, uh, wanted to go to New York so bad, and start a career. And I thought that if I went along with her, that I would just hold her back. Did she know that? No. No, no, she really doesn't. Well, you might want to consider mentioning it. It may make a difference. Yeah, but that's kind of the point, though, you know. I, uh, I still don't want to do anything that's going to keep her from what she wants. Well, just a thought. You may want to give her the chance to choose. [laughter] Oh, yeah, yeah... [glass chimes] Uh, this is the part of the night when the wedding party's supposed to get up and make speeches, but I, uh, I thought I'd say something. First of all, I'd like to thank Annalise and Olivia. There they are, still working, I see. [applause] I want to thank both of you for rolling with this crazy, crazy wedding. I mean, the whole experience so far has been fun and full of surprises, and just incredibly beautiful. Which brings me to my almost-husband, Lucas. Before we met, if something happened like, I don't know, having ten guests unexpectedly show up? I love you, Flannigan clan. [cheering] Whooo! Yeah. But honestly, if that happened before I met you, it would've completely thrown me. I wouldn't have been able to just be in the moment and enjoy one of the most special days of my life. Lucas, I want you to know I'm a better person with you in my life. You really taught me that if we have each other, all the other stuff is just details. So why get too caught up in them? So, thank you for changing my life. Thank you for being my life. I truly believe that everything that's ever happened to me, the good and the bad, has brought me to you, and you to me. So, to love. (All) To love. To love. To love. That was some speech Jen made. Yes, it was. You know, I've been wanting to thank you. For what? Well, you, you helped me see something. I did? Yeah, you reminded me just how happy I am that Mick and I could put our past away and move forward. So, you're saying we should too. I know it's scary. But... There's no but. Falling in love is always a risk, but in the end, what other choice do you have? ♪ Hey. You look pretty. You look beautiful. ♪ Look at her dress. Precious.

I'm going to send my recommendation on Monday. I think this is going to be the beginning of a long and very profitable relationship. Thank you. Enjoy. Goodnight. [squeals excitedly] Congratulations.

The last five years, all I've done is work. My life has been one big to-do list without you. There's something I need to tell you, too, um... I never wanted to let you go, I... I never wanted to, uh, break up. What? I thought that if you stayed with me, that you wouldn't be able to pursue your dreams the way that you wanted to. That's why you didn't come to New York. We could've talked about that. I didn't want you to look back in 20 years and regret not going after the thing that you cared about most. Brad? All I've ever wanted was to be with you. I can't believe you kept that after all this time. Yeah, love will make you do stupid things. What did you say? I love you. You do? Lisy, I have loved you since the day that you took me out at home plate. I've never stopped loving you. [crying] I'm warming up to the idea of moving to New York. What? Got an office there, you know.
