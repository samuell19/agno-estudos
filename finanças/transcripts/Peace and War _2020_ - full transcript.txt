We want Begin ﻿The election campaign is on. Good morning, happy holiday. ﻿The summer of 1981. ﻿Israel is in the midst of a stormy election campaign. ﻿Is this the nation you want? ﻿Or do you want a civilized nation? ﻿A nation that speaks... Enough with your hatred! ﻿A close political battle between'Shimon Peres, leader of the Israeli Labor Party ﻿and Menachem Begin, the incumbent prime minister ﻿fighting for another term. ﻿Buckle down, strengthen your spirit, ﻿because in the next 7 weeks we are liable to face ﻿provocations as well. ﻿They know how to provoke. ﻿This is what the nation will look like! Begin's nation! ﻿Peres, go home! ﻿Just days away from election day ﻿Prime Minister Menachem Begin ﻿launches a bold military campaign that was planned for many months. ﻿The bombing of the nuclear reactor built by Saddam Hussein in Iraq. ﻿Saddam Hussein, that murderous tyrant, ﻿prepared the radioactive poison for our children ﻿that will come out of atomic bombs. ﻿To understand Begin, his outlook on the world, ﻿the Holocaust played a major role. ﻿Have you ever heard of the one and a half million Jewish children ﻿who were taken to the gas chambers and subjected to the Zyklon B cyanide? ﻿He was a witness. ﻿It's the most horrendous thing that happened to the Jewish people. ﻿And now we can say to our wonderful children, ﻿you will bear children in the Land of Israel! ﻿Begin, King of Israel ﻿"I often asked myself, ﻿"were it permitted to go to Brest, ﻿"would you go to the city where you spent your sun-filled youth? ﻿"No. You will not enter the gates of your hometown, where you studied ﻿"and dreamed and suffered and rejoiced... ﻿"for it is gone. ﻿"Perhaps the small House with its light of love and sorrowful poverty ﻿"is still standing, ﻿"but the home of Mother and Father is gone forever. ﻿"No, I will not follow the shadows. ﻿"These shadows live, they will not die. ﻿"They are in me." ﻿Rare home movies: ﻿Menachem Begin and his wife Aliza in the early 1950s ﻿in South Africa, clebrating with the Beitar youth movement. ﻿In the young Israel of those days, ﻿Begin, leader of the Israeli right, is pushed to the political margins. ﻿Founding father David Ben Gurion deemed him the enemy erf democracy, ﻿calling him "a typical Hitlerist." ﻿Begin surrounds himself with those resentful of the centralized leftist government ﻿and wages a patient, persistent battle. ﻿He ran in eight election campaigns and failed, ﻿over and over again. ﻿The story goes ﻿that someone used to sit outside Metzudat Ze'ev, the party's headquarters, ﻿shouting, "Begin to power, Begin to power!" ﻿"Begin to power," all day long. ﻿So someone asked him, "How much are they paying you?" ﻿He replied: "I get one penny ﻿"for every time I shout 'Begin to power."' ﻿"And shouting is worth one penny to you?" ﻿He replied: "It's not a lot of money, ﻿"but it's a lifelong job." ﻿At 64, after a severe heart attack, ﻿he runs for the ninth time and he knows, ﻿this is his last chance. ﻿Hello. ﻿Who did you vote for? ﻿Polling stations nationwide closed three minutes ago ﻿and the votes that will shape ﻿thhe ninth Knesset are being counted. ﻿That night I was chairman of the ballot committee ﻿where I lived, in Rehavia, Jerusalem. ﻿Most of tihe votes in Rehavia were given to the Labor Party. ﻿The Herut Party got very few votes. ﻿That night I noticed that the slips we were taking out and counting ﻿were all Herut. ﻿I said, something's going on here. ﻿This is the television prediction. ﻿Again, an unauthorized prediction, ﻿a prediction that foresees a distinet victory ﻿to Herat over the Labor Party. ﻿The political correspondent goes to the place ﻿where the next prime minister is elected ﻿and the next prime minister was supposed to be Shimon Peres. ﻿A few minutes later I realized that I should be somewhere else. ﻿I raced over to Metzudat Ze'ev. ﻿It's about time. ﻿Begin is prime minister, tears flowed, ﻿because for us, you can't understand this, ﻿for Herutniks like me, for Begin fo be prime minister... ﻿I saw euphoria bordering on stuper. ﻿There was this sense of, "We, the oppressed, have finally done it." ﻿Meanwhile the journalists felt, "What is going to happen?" We're heading for the unknown. ﻿After 29 years in the opposition, it's happening, ﻿Menachem Begin takes up leadership ﻿and he has a well-arranged action plan ﻿that will completely change Israeli reality ﻿and the Middle East. ﻿Tagar ﻿Through all obstacles and enemies ﻿Whether you go up or down in the flames of revolt ﻿Carry the flame to kindle, never mind. ﻿Hello! ﻿How are we? Look how the TV is filming you. ﻿Don't open your mouth, smile. ﻿Look at the television. ﻿Let's all be filmed together. ﻿Look at the television. That's it. ﻿They got their report cards, practically all A+. ﻿Ravit is a straight As student, ﻿Ayala got an outstanding report card. ﻿Anjd this one is starting school. ﻿This year she'll be going to school. ﻿Three days after the elections, ﻿the newly elected prime minister goes to Samaria ﻿to celebrate with his settler friends. ﻿We stood on the hill of an archaeological dig, ﻿I remember it vividly, ﻿the enthusiasm with which he infected the crowd ﻿and he promised many settlements like Elon Moreh. ﻿I want to say ﻿that in a few weeks or months or the near future ﻿there will be more Elon Morehs. ﻿Did you believe him? ﻿Not only did I believe him, ﻿Rabbi Levinger said he was handing over the Gush Emunim settlement portfolio ﻿to Menachem Begin. ﻿Up to here, as expected, ﻿Begin adheres to the image fixed in his rivals and supporters' minds, ﻿a man of Greater Israel, a warmonger, an inciter, ﻿and then, a few days after the visit to the Territories, ﻿he takes everyone by surprise with a conflicting commitment. ﻿Mr. Dayan, did you and Mr. Begin discuss ﻿a political collaboration? ﻿Our discussion was private, ﻿we discussed public issues, but it was private. ﻿In this private discussion they agreed, Moshe Dayan, former political rival, ﻿revered general whose glory was dulled due to the Yom Kippur War debacle, ﻿would be foreign minister in Begin's government. ﻿They agreed that ﻿though the Israeli government has the authority to apply Israeli sovereignty, ﻿it would not do so during peace talks. ﻿Not "peace negotiations," rather "peace talks." ﻿As we ascended to the heights of joy ﻿whereby the right had risen to power, ﻿thus we plummeted into the depths of despair when we realized ﻿that a rightist rose to power, but not the right-wing ideology. ﻿When Begin rose to power, did you expect him to annex the Territories? ﻿Since he's an ultra democrat, ﻿he will never be willing to apply sovereignty ﻿without granting full citizenship to the Arabs of Judea and Samaria, ﻿therefore, there's nothing to expect from him. ﻿Is it bad that he's an ultra democrat? ﻿When you have a set of values, ﻿national, Jewish, liberal, democratic values, ﻿you must organize them based on your priorities. ﻿Mr. Begin, could you tell us ﻿what kind of prime minister you will be? ﻿A good, Jewish prime minister. ﻿Let her... Let her come. ﻿To the secular, Sabra Israel, ﻿Begin brings loyalty to the Jewish tradition and its symbols. ﻿Begin is a Jewish prime minister, from the Holocaust and Revival generation, ﻿striving to find the balance between supposedly conflicting values, ﻿between a Jewish state and a democracy, ﻿between the national and the liberal, ﻿between pursuing peace and keeping the homeland whole. ﻿July 4th, 1977, American Independence Day, ﻿there's a reception for U.S. Ambassador Lewis, ﻿and he is introduced to the Romanian ambassador, Jon Kovac. ﻿Begin took Kovac by the elbow, ' moved him aside ﻿and said, "Mr. Ambassador, ﻿"if President Ceausescu were to invite me, I would gladly oblige." ﻿The target of pursuit is Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. ﻿The matchmaker is the Romanian tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu. ﻿Begin took advantage of every channel he had ﻿to meet with Sadat ﻿and he sent him messages through Ceausescu ﻿that he is willing to talk. ﻿Today, just before 2 p.m., ﻿the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched an attack against Israel. ﻿In the winter of 1973, Israel was surprised by a joint Arab attack. ﻿The toll was heavy. 2,222 Israelis dead. ﻿15,600 Egyptians. 4,000 Syrians. ﻿The death toll of another round of battles between Israel and the Arab countries. ﻿For the Israelis this was another reminder ﻿as to how fragile Israeli existence is in the Middle East. ﻿On the other hand, Egyptian President Sadat ﻿came out of the war convinced that he'd restered his country's honor. ﻿After Begin, Sadat also visits Ceausescu. ﻿Dan Patir, Begin's spokesperson, ﻿brings firsthand testimony from Sadat himself. ﻿Sadat said to me, ﻿"I asked Ceausescu two questions. ﻿"Is the Begin you saw last month ﻿"prepared to make peace with the Arabs?" ﻿"To that," he said, "I got a positive answer from Ceausescu. ﻿"And the second question, is Begin strong enough after the elections ﻿"to go ahead with this peace process?" ﻿To that Ceausescu also implied that the answer is yes. ﻿Among the attendees, a guest, Yasser Arafat, ﻿the Palestinian leader that Begin called with scorn, ﻿"The one with the hair on his face." ﻿Sadat speaks for two hours. ﻿Just before the end he goes off script ﻿and surprises with an unusual statement. ﻿Israel will be surprised ﻿to hear me say now ﻿that I am prepared to go to their parliament, the Knesset, ﻿and talk to them. ﻿You hear this story ﻿and your journalistic senses light up. ﻿You have to get the prime minister's comment. ﻿I called his home and Mrs. Begin picked up, ﻿I said I want a word with the prime minister ﻿and she said, "He's shaving." ﻿So I said, "Please, it's very urgent." ﻿He comes to the phone and says, "What happened?" ﻿"I read the report about what Sadat said, how do you comment?" ﻿This is my personal written invitation to President Sadat to come to Jerusalem ﻿to visit our country. ﻿This is the letter, and don't show it to the journalists. -Yes, sir. ﻿Thank you. ﻿We, the Israelis, stretch out our hand to you. ﻿It is not, as you know, a weak hand. ﻿No more wars, no more bloodshed. ﻿Peace, real peace, and forever. ﻿on Saturday, before Sadat's arrival, Begin asked to see me. ﻿His office was on the 12th floor of Metzudat Ze'ev. ﻿Begin looked around ﻿at the skyscrapers coming up in Tel Aviv in those years ﻿and said, "Aryeh, we will make peace." ﻿"Do you know how long I've been dreaming of this day?" ﻿I asked, "How long?" ﻿"Since November 29th, 1947, ﻿"that the day may come and we'll talk face to face ﻿"to the Arab leaders about peace." ﻿But he hid it for many years... ﻿He always said it, but no one noticed, ﻿and not without reason, because he said other things as well. ﻿He says he wants peace ﻿but he's talking about keeping the homeland whole as well. ﻿How do these two desires go together? ﻿As early as the spring of '44, from his place of hiding, ﻿Begin publishes a statement to our Arab neighbors. ﻿"Our Arab neighbors," not "our Arab enemies." ﻿"Our Arab neighbors, ﻿"we extend our hand to peace and brotherhood. ﻿"Do not dismiss it. ﻿"The Hebrew government will grant you full equal rights. ﻿"The Hebrew and Arabic languages will be the languages of the land. ﻿"The Hebrew state will be a helme to all of us ﻿"amd peace and neighborly relations will reign between it and the independent Arab countries." ﻿Hello, how are you? -Do you know me? ﻿Of course I remember you, and how. ﻿The sheikh's son, of course. ﻿I visited you in your tent, I drank coffee. ﻿"However, take heed, ﻿"do not attempt to raise a hand on Jewish lives, ﻿"for if you do, we will have to cut it off." ﻿A strong hand is extended in peace, ﻿this is Begin's version of the "Iron Wall" of the spiritual father, ﻿Beitar leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky. ﻿The Iron Wall as a means to realize the utopian vision. ﻿The first time Begin "stumbled upon" Jabotinsky ﻿was when he was 15. ﻿Jabotinsky came to Brest, Begin's hometown, to make a speech. ﻿"The provincial theater is full to capacity. ﻿"For you, the boy, there is no room. ﻿"You barely made your way in to the orchestra pit. ﻿"You're sitting down there listening to the man, ﻿"sensing in all your bones how he lifts you up and up. ﻿"Are you captivated? ﻿"No. Beyond that. ﻿"You have been consecrated. ﻿"Someone whispers in your ear, you are consecrated to my ideology forever ﻿"and you say, yes, am consecrated forever. ﻿It was an extraordinary event. ﻿The atmosphere was... ﻿not merely festive, it was surreal. You couldn't believe it was happening. ﻿The happiest moment in my career was at Ben Gurion Airport, ﻿the door opened and I said the words: ﻿"Now President Sadat is on the air-stair ﻿"waving hello." ﻿A man comes down, dressed tip-top, in a tailored suit, ﻿smiling, standing tall, ﻿this mysterious Arab, dark complexion, tall. ﻿It was like a scene from... it was like a fairy tale. ﻿We were the generation that saw the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War ﻿and the War of Attrition. ﻿Thinking "Anwar Sadat is coming to Israel" was inconceivable. ﻿You always call me "an old lady," Mr. President. ﻿Oh my god, this can't be! ﻿You see? Peace. ﻿Sadat traveled the routine routes in Jerusalem past the cheering crowds, ﻿a speech in the Knesset, Yad Vashem, a meeting with the president and so forth. ﻿The trip to Jerusalem was set 'f@r the day of the Muslim Festival of the Sacrifice, ﻿Eid al-Adha. ﻿Sadat's prayer at Al-Aqsa during the holiday ﻿was geared at the Muslim faithful, ﻿in an attempt to eenvey, ﻿"If we make peace with the Israelis we'll be able to pray at this holy site." ﻿Sadat's message was rejected. ﻿The Arab world united against the peace initiative. ﻿Anwar Sadat was marked as a traitor. ﻿The next morning I broadcast from .the prime minister's office, ﻿Begin came out of a meeting with Sadat ﻿and said to me, "Mr. Kittal, you can tell the listeners ﻿"that the Egyptian president and I agreed... ﻿"no more war." ﻿This was extremely dramatic ﻿After a meeting of a few hours, before the principles were agreed on, ﻿there's an agreement that no matter what, no more war. ﻿A few days after the meeting with President Sadat, ﻿Begin arrives in London. An official visit, historically charged. ﻿The tragic scene is like a serious incident during the Blitz. ﻿Casualties were very heavy. ﻿July 1946, ﻿the Irgun, led by Menachem Begin, ﻿blews up the British administration in Jerusalem's King David Hotel. ﻿65 deaths are reported, nearly 50 others were injured. ﻿Jewish terrorist organization., "Irgun Tzva Leumi," ﻿openly admitted responsibility for the bombing. ﻿Age: 38. Height: 1.75m. Build: Thin. ﻿Peculiarities: Long hooked nose, bad teeth,. ﻿This is how public enemy no. 1 is described, ﻿Irgun leader Menachem Begin. ﻿To our last day on earth we will take pride ﻿in having fought for the liberation of the Jewish people. We weren't terrorists, we were freedom fighters. ﻿Following one meeting with the Egyptian president, ﻿the former public enemy is crowned by the British as a man of peace. ﻿Begin isn't fazed. ﻿He is troubled by a major issue. ﻿How to make peace without renouncing the historic rights ﻿in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. ﻿He declares a health issue, dodges the diplomatic agenda ﻿and shuts himself in his room. ﻿He summoned Yechiel Kadishai, a longtime aide, ﻿and dictated a proposal for an arrangement regarding the Palestinians, ﻿the first draft of the Autonomy Plan. ﻿The Autonomy Plan was Begin's flagship plan. ﻿The plan is based on separation: ﻿Separation between the holy land and the Palestinian citizens ﻿that live their lives on this land. ﻿"We won't be Rhodesia." Meaning, no apartheid. ﻿His words. ﻿In internal discussions he even called it South Africa. ﻿He proposes autonomy for the Arab residents. ﻿They will establish a government, an administrative council ﻿that they will elect in free elections ﻿and it will have authority in all areas of life, ﻿ministries, finance, trade, transportation, police, you name it, ﻿but security and public order will be under Israel's authority. ﻿And what about sovereignty over'the Territories? ﻿Begin suggests leaving this issue open. ﻿Instead of applying sovereignty, preventing foreign sovereignty. I ﻿won't apply sovereignty, me, the Israeli, ﻿and you, the Arab, King Hussein, won't apply sovereignty. ﻿The PLO wasn't part of the discourse. ﻿And that is Begin's greatest sin ﻿against his own ideology. ﻿Any autonomy ultimately leads to an independent state. ﻿But when he wanted a peace treaty with Egypt, ﻿he was willing to pay by granting autonomy to Israel's Arabs, ﻿knowing this is liable to lead to a state ﻿and he hopes he'll be able to drag his feet and the Autonomy Plan ﻿will simply evaporate. ﻿Begin viewed the autonomy as the only alternative to partitioning the country ﻿and the establishment of a Palestinian state, ﻿that's why he wanted it so badly. It was his idea? ﻿We are on our way to Egypt ﻿to negotiate a peace treaty ﻿as equals. Only mutual respect and willingness ﻿will bring peace. ﻿It was terribly hot. ﻿see Sadat going like this, a servant comes ﻿and he says, "Open the window." ﻿Angry. Always somewhat sweaty. ﻿I lean into the prime minister and say, "He's very tense." ﻿He looks at me and says, "So am I." ﻿I said, here we go! ﻿Begin is convinced that the Autonomy Plan ﻿is the perfect solution for the Palestinian issue. ﻿Sadat is not thrilled, to say the least. ﻿The negotiations are stuck. ﻿Is there any possibility this meeting could be a failure? ﻿Maybe, maybe. Why not? ﻿The delegations of Egypt and Israel discussed the Palestinian problem. ﻿The position of Egypt is that in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip ﻿a Palestinian state should be established. ﻿The position of Israel is ﻿that the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district ﻿should enjoy self-rule. ﻿Citizens are requested ﻿to leave the area, ﻿A lethal attack on the Coastal Highway ﻿leading to Tel Aviv. ﻿The number of fatalities: 35. ﻿This was the first time ‘Since the establishment of the state ﻿that Jewish citizens were subject to a curfew. ﻿All citizens were asked to remain at home and not go to work. ﻿The lethal attack was carried out by terrorists from Lebanon ﻿where the Palestinian Liberation Organization is gaining power, ﻿headed by Yasser Arafat. ﻿But this terrorist, Menachem Begin, ﻿and you, the British, know him. ﻿It is his mentality - terrorism. ﻿Facism, Nazism. It's very important. ﻿With terrorist attacks and global political activities, ﻿Arafat reminds Begin and Sadat, ﻿"We, the Palestinians, are here. You can't ignore us." ﻿Internally, attempts to bring peace are met with aggressive resistance. ﻿What happened to you, Mr. Begin? ﻿"The Base," the loyal allies, ﻿cannot accept the price of peace. ﻿You don't have to renounce your ideology for peace. ﻿Peace is not the final objective. ﻿Implementing the ideology is the objective. ﻿The purpose is that the people of Israel live securely in its land ﻿and that's what we must strive for and pay for, if need be, ﻿or others have to pay for it. ﻿Were you afraid of peace? ﻿No, we were afraid of its price. ﻿The price that Begin is required to pay is heavy: ﻿Returning the Sinai to Egypt, ﻿including the uprooting of towns in the Rafiah Plain ﻿and recognition, even partially, of the Palestinian nationalism. ﻿Autonomy, a supposed administration, ﻿wich every moderate Arab knows ﻿is the onset of a Palestinian state. ﻿This is a deception of the Land of Israel. ﻿The opponents, ﻿Gush Emunim members, the settlers, ﻿do their best to fail the treaty in the making. ﻿Begin's relationship with Gush Emunim was complex. ﻿On the one hand, he sensed this emotional affinity. ﻿Begin wanted settlements everywhere ﻿and they're willing to comply, ﻿in true pioneering conditions. ﻿He respected that very much. ﻿On the other hand.. ﻿We will keep settling. ﻿That is our answer to the Israeli government. ﻿Begin said the Gush Emunim members had a Messiah complex. ﻿They saw themselves linked to some historic process ﻿that is divine, ﻿that has a cosmic, Messianic meaning. ﻿There is a great Zionist process ﻿that no power can oppose. ﻿The bulldozer can vacate the rocks, ﻿but these "rocks" can't be evacuated ﻿and ultimately they determine a fact. ﻿They don't have to heed government instructions. ﻿They can present the government with a done deal. ﻿He has an ideology he wants to fulfill ﻿and ultimately he did. ﻿Right after the '77 elections ﻿there were 38 settlements with 1,900 settlers in the West Bank. ﻿In the mid '80s, under Begin's government and his successors, ﻿the number of settlers spiked to 50,000. ﻿As of 2019, 450,000 Jews live in Judea and Samaria, ﻿4% of the Israeli population. ﻿Good week to you, Israeli citizens. ﻿Tonight I want to talk to you ﻿about several political, economic and social issues. ﻿Let's start with the Camp David conference. ﻿A very important meeting. ﻿At Camp David we will protect our people in the Land of Israel ﻿because in this cruel world, from Czechoslovakia to Lebanon, ﻿not only can we say, we must say, ﻿if we are not for ourselves, then who will be for us? ﻿Compromises will be mandatory. ﻿Without them, no progress can be expected. ﻿The points of debate remained the same: ﻿The nature of the Palestinian autonomy ﻿and the fate of the towns in the Yamit district. ﻿The idyllic atmosphere of Camp David culdn't soften the two leaders. ﻿Jimmy Carter took upon himself the role of aggressive mediator. ﻿It's the president of the United States. I was nervous. ﻿The situation was hard for me, ﻿sitting with the U.S. president, drafting texts with him. ﻿Often I had to say, ﻿"No, Mr. President, this is a no, this is a no..." ﻿Abtimes he was very angry and lashed out. ﻿"You don't want peace, this will ruin everything," ﻿statements of that nature. ﻿Weizman thought that Begin is liable to torpedo the whole thing. ﻿He feared that Begin's hesitation ﻿and insistence on a few formal issues ﻿could impede the peace treaty. ﻿Another major party in the Israeli delegation ﻿is Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, ﻿in charge of the creative solutions. ﻿Dayan was ill by then, ﻿he was in severe pain. ﻿He didn't sleep well at night. ﻿He would wake me up, ﻿not to discuss professional matters, rather worldly wisdom, ﻿he quoted Shlonsky and Alterman by heart. ﻿And you listened. ﻿I listened attentively. ﻿I respected the man very much. ﻿He wasn't the Dayan of the Six Day War, ﻿he was the Dayan of the Yom Kippur War, ﻿but he had many ideas, ﻿he was very independent in thought, very creative. ﻿When you read the statements of the people who attended Camp David, ﻿you understand that the wording was paramount, not the meaning. ﻿And the meaning was that Begin paves the way ﻿to a Palestinian state! ﻿The meaning was that Begin uproots towns in the Sinai. ﻿Therefore his leadership was hollow. ﻿The Egyptians, and Carter, ﻿claimed that Begin is stubborn, fecusing on minute details, ﻿but it was those minute details that gave us the detailed peace treaty ﻿that is in place to this day. ﻿Following 13 days of intense discussions, ﻿harsh crises and President Carter's headstrong pressure, ﻿white smoke billows over Camp David. ﻿The architects of peace are welcomed home with love and cries of joy. ﻿The opponents are thrust to the sidelines, ﻿accumulating strength to continue the struggle. ﻿The Knesset is asked to approve the Camp David Accords. ﻿MKs, please be quiet! ﻿The performance was in Camp David, not here! ﻿I will not let the prime minister ﻿say things to the Israeli people that will raise false hope... ﻿MK Geula Cohen, I call you to order for the third time. ﻿Begin clearly presents the options, ﻿a peace treaty or retaining the settlements in the Rafiah Plain. ﻿Those are the options. ﻿Those are the two options. ﻿There is no third. ﻿And I declare that this is the path to peace, ﻿it's the supreme national interest ﻿of my friend the settlers as well. ﻿The result: 84 vote in favor, ﻿17 abstain, 13 MKs oppose. ﻿Over six months after the Camp David conference, ﻿the historic moment arrived. ﻿The peacemakers convened to sign the treaty on the White House lawn. ﻿It is, ladies and gentlemen, ﻿the third greatest day in my life. ﻿The first was May the 14th, 1948 ﻿when our independence in our ancestors' land was proclaimed. ﻿The second day was when Jerusalem became one city. ﻿This is the third day in my life: ﻿I have signed the treaty of peace with our great neighbor, with Egypt. ﻿The heart is full and overflowing. ﻿A few days after the signing, Israel hosts the Eurovision contest... Israel? 12 points. ﻿And believe it or not, it wins. ﻿The Broadcasting Authority gave me two tickets to the Eurovision ﻿where Gali Atari and Milk & Honey won with "Hallelujah." ﻿It was five days after signing the peace treaty ﻿and the next day we went to Cairo. ﻿Begin can now tick off the box. ﻿The peace treaty with Egypt shattered the Arab unity, ﻿eliminated Israel's existential fears. ﻿September 1st, 1939, ﻿the day the Nazis invaded Poland, ﻿Begin and Beitar leaders convened at the site of the movement's newspaper, ﻿"Der Moment." ﻿Uri Zvi Greenberg burst into the room, ﻿looked at them and said, "You're insane, what are you doing here? ﻿"Run, you shouldn't be here." ﻿Begin and wife Aliza flee east, ﻿find refuge with friends, Batya and Israel (Scheib) Eldad, ﻿in a small village outside Vilnius. ﻿Begin and my father were playing chess in that house in the village. ﻿The NKVD arrives, the Russian secret police, ﻿and arrests Menachem Begin. ﻿My mother burst into tears and Begin reassured her, ﻿"Everything will be alright, ﻿"they said I'd be back after the interrogation." ﻿They both knew, they all knew that... ﻿one doesn't get out of Russian prison that easily. ﻿"My wife and I exchanged a few words, ﻿"there was no time for more. ﻿"I told her I think I'll be back, ﻿"anyway she mustn't arouse pity. ﻿"A few minutes later, her waving hand vanished from sight." ﻿Begin was imprisoned in a labor camp inSiberia for nine months, ﻿a bitter memory that he tok with him to the prime minister's office in Jerusalem. ﻿When he becomes prime minister ﻿within a week or two he summons ﻿the director of the Shin Bet, Avraham Ahituv ﻿and said, "I forbid you to use force or violence during interrogations." ﻿This was a novelty. ﻿He asked, "What then?" ﻿"Only the wisdom of the interrogator." ﻿Around two years later President Carter said to Begin ﻿that he's getting complaints about the Shin Bet using force, beating someone. ﻿He summons Ahituv again ﻿and says, "I said no use of force. ﻿"This is not the Inquisition. ﻿"You don't use force or violence, ﻿"no beatings during interrogations." ﻿This is the same Begin who dedicated his book, ﻿"White Nights" to the unknown victim of torture. ﻿36 months after the joyous moment ﻿came payment time, ﻿the uprooting of the towns in Yamit. ﻿The new defense minister Ariel Sharon was appointed the man in charge. ﻿The fear of civil war intensifies. ﻿Menachem Begin accepts Defense Minister Ariel Sharen's plan ﻿to vacate the residents of Yamit by force ﻿and raze the town. ﻿I arrived in Yamit with 150 students. ﻿That day Channel 1, ﻿the only Israeli channel, ﻿was reporting on the arrival of the students in Yamit. ﻿Shut up! No one's filming ﻿You either! ﻿Are you nuts? ﻿And I was asked by the correspondent, ﻿"What will happen if you're driven out by force?" ﻿As a 25-year-old radical at the time, ﻿I replied aggressively, ﻿"We will meet force with force." ﻿The next day there was a Knesset discussion ﻿and Prime Minister Begin argued with my statement. ﻿"Tzechi, Tzechi, my son..." ﻿Whenever he wanted to offend someone he'd distort their name, ﻿I assume he knew my name is Tzachi, ﻿but he called me Tzechi. ﻿"Ask your mother who we applied force against. ﻿"We applied force against the British, not against IDF soldiers." ﻿We are fighting for peace. ﻿We should be thankful. ﻿Yes, peace comes with difficulties. ﻿Yes, peace comes with pain. ﻿Yes, peace comes with victims. ﻿They are all better than the victims of war! ﻿This I declare, ﻿the man who lead a freedom organization. ﻿I will tell the Knesset about a very simple human thought. ﻿Why shouldn't I share it with them? ﻿I broke my leg ﻿and one day or night, I don't know, ﻿a thought came to me... ﻿Oh no, if war breaks out, ﻿dozens, perhaps hundreds of our young men will lie in bed ﻿with a broken leg or with no leg at all, God forbid. ﻿War mflisi be prevented ﻿In retrospect, was this peace a mistake? ﻿No. ﻿I thought this peace could be a trap and Egypt would use it ﻿to build military bases in the Sinai and attack us from there, ﻿that didn't happen. ﻿In retrospect, that peace wasn't a mistake. ﻿All people standing by the windows, please go to the shelters. ﻿A few days after Begin was elected ﻿as prime minister for a second term, ﻿a war of attrition breaks o.ut in the north. ﻿For 12 days, PLO artillery bombards Kiryat Shmona, Nahariya, Metula. ﻿We will protect our children! ﻿If a hand of a bipedal animal is raised against them, that hand will be cut off. ﻿Just a little while more ﻿and not one more Katyusha will land on Kiryat Shmona! ﻿The target was marked: The PLO, ﻿the Palestinian Liberation Organization and its leader, Yasser Arafat. ﻿On the way to the target, tragedy. ﻿Members of the Muslim Brotherhood assassinate the partner to peace, ﻿Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. ﻿After Sadat's funeral, and I was there, ﻿Menachem Begin met with ﻿the American Secretary of State ﻿Alexander Haig ﻿and to his astonishment ﻿Haig said, "Now we must assure ﻿"we establish a Palestinian entity." ﻿As he perceived the peace treaty with Egypt, Begin thought, ﻿"I give the Sinai, I get the West Bank." ﻿Then he finds out, "No, you don't get the West Bank." ﻿Once he realized that the world would insist he talk to the PLO, ﻿the idea was to destroy the Palestinian option. ﻿In November 1981, a health incident suspends the urgent national tasks. ﻿68-year-old Menachem Begin slips in the bathtub. ﻿21 days of painful hospitalization ﻿left much time for thought. ﻿Begin returns home with new insights. ﻿He's convinced. This is the time for momentous moves. ﻿The first trial balloon: ﻿Applying Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, ﻿Syrian territory seized by Israel during the Six Day War. ﻿Immediately. Tonight. ﻿"Gentlemen, ﻿"this is obviously a bold step and we will have problems. ﻿"I am sure the United States will protest. ﻿"What will Egypt do? ﻿"Militarily, I don't think it can wage war against us. ﻿"Syria... ﻿"it knows that if it attacks, it will collapse. ﻿"Russia? It is dealing with a coup in Poland, ﻿"it has Afghanistan, so will it deploy aircrafts against us? ﻿"Will it deploy tanks?" ﻿All in favor, raise your hands. Please count. ﻿In a quick procedure the Knesset agrees with Begin ﻿and authorizes the annexation of the Golan Heights. ﻿The time is 9:30 a.m., ﻿U.S. Ambassador Lewis is summoned by the prime minister ﻿to hear Israel's reaction to the U.S. sanctions ﻿following Knesset confirmation of the Golan Heights law. ﻿Reality complied with the political analysis. ﻿The U.S. was angry, it reproached and that was that. ﻿The time is 10:30 a.m., ﻿the U.S. ambassador ends his discussion with the prime minister. ﻿IDF generals, commanders of the various forces, headed by the chief of staff, arrive. ﻿The other actors, Russia, Egypt, Syria, ﻿evidently didn't respond. ﻿The game can be stepped up. ﻿Begin demands the ministers agree that the IDF enter Lebanon ﻿and cleanse it of terrorist bases. ﻿Defense Minister Arik Sharon presents the big military plan: ﻿attacking the PLO, weakening the Syrians, ﻿reinforcing the Christians before the Lebanese presidential elections. ﻿The defense minister presents the plan ﻿and Begin grants the ministers the floor. ﻿He lets Erlich speak, Burg, ﻿this one and that one and they all have their reservations. ﻿Then Begin says to Sharon, "You see, Arik? ﻿"It's not the time yet." ﻿With that it was off the table ﻿and never reintreduced, ﻿not to the security cabinet, not to the Knesset plenum. ﻿Despite the resistance, Begin and Sharon proceed. ﻿Sharon goes to Lebanon to meet with the Christian leaders, the Gemayel family. ﻿On the way back from Beirut ﻿Sharon called me at home in the middle of the night ﻿and uttered the zinger, ﻿"Tonight I tied their legs, ﻿"I agreed on the order of actions with the Christians. ﻿"They are with us." ﻿Begin is im Washington ﻿preparing the political groundwork, ﻿obtaining American agreement for an Israeli military campaign ﻿if the latter is attacked and distinctly provoked. ﻿And here it comes, the necessary distinct provocation. ﻿Gunfire fatally wounded Israel's ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. ﻿The Israeli government has decided to charge the IDF ﻿with removing all the Galilee towns ﻿from the line of fire of terrorists, their headquarters and bases, ﻿which are in Lebanon. ﻿The name of the operation: Peace for Galilee. ﻿Our armored corps races in. ﻿The guys wave hello and give the thumbs up. ﻿"Leave it to us," they smile, and we are all hopeful. ﻿Operation Peace for Galilee is not a military campaign forced upon us. ﻿The terrorists didn't threaten the existence of the State of Israel. ﻿They just threatened the lives of the citizens of Israel. ﻿Begin and Defense Minister Sharon join the forces raiding Lebanon. ﻿They visit command headquarters and remain overnight in ﻿I wak,e up in the morning in the Rockenstein Hotel in Safed, ﻿I go to the war room with first light ﻿and the war room commander tells me that the Beaufort fell. ﻿I go to Arik ﻿and say, "Arik, the Beaufort has fallen." ﻿We go to Begin, "The Beaufort has fallen." ﻿Then Begin says, "Let's go up to the Beaufort." ﻿We go up. ﻿I am not informed what happened, ﻿who was there, nothing. ﻿We land first, I get out first ﻿and I instantly see, 50-100 meters beyond the landing, ﻿the bodies of dead terrorists. ﻿Still pretty warm. From the night before. ﻿I say to Arik, "There was a battle here last night." ﻿As we're talking, Begin lands. ﻿Six soldiers were killed in the uncalled for battle to seize the Beaufort. ﻿Begin was not apprised. ﻿I feel the mountain air. ﻿It's high. ﻿This place was... -An open wound. ﻿A threat for years and years. ﻿Very high. ﻿These young soldiers took part in... -The occupation? ﻿Where? -This young fellow. ﻿Did you fight all night? -Not all night. ﻿Did they have machine guns? ﻿They had fairly large firearms around the fort ﻿and rifles in the trench ﻿Did many surrender? ﻿No one surrendered. -No one? ﻿They were either killed or fled. -Yes? ﻿Thank you. ﻿Israeli prime ministers like rubbing shoulders with soldiers, ﻿to boast the image of "Mr. Security." ﻿There are no combat images of Begin. ﻿The encounter on the Beaufort was embarrassing and a one off. ﻿Begin deemed himself a path maker, ah ideologist, a statesman. ﻿From that narrow perspective, Begin can chalk up a success. ﻿He warded off international pressure and enabled his warlord, Arik Sharon, ﻿to wage weeks of war. ﻿It is said that Begin reverpd generals. ﻿That's not completely true and not completely untrue. ﻿There were three generals whom Begin revered very, very much. ﻿Moshe Dayan, Ariel Sharon and Rafael Eitan. ﻿Three bold fighters, heroes, in fact, ﻿three farmers, men of the soil, ﻿qualities that Begin greatly respected ﻿and they were the complete opposite of himself. ﻿Two wars were essentially waged in Lebanon. ﻿One against PLO terrorists and one against the Syrian army. ﻿A blitzkrieg ﻿that according to initial statements, Israel didn't want. ﻿If we reach 40 km from our northern border, ﻿our work will have been done and the fighting will stop. ﻿I want the Syrian president to heed my words, ﻿act in this spirit in Lebanon ﻿and your Syrian soldiers will remain unharmed. ﻿Just a few hours after this placatory statement, ﻿war is on. ﻿The IAF set out to apply nine years of planning, training and advanced systems ﻿to destroy the Syrian air defense ﻿that caused great damage to the Israeli air force ﻿during the Yom Kippur War. ﻿I see a MiG! ﻿Okay, I have eye contact. ﻿I'm taking it out. ﻿Victory was swift. ﻿19 missile batteries were destroyed. ﻿During the air combat that day ﻿29 MiGs were shot down. ﻿This is what I think Operation Peace for Galilee did for us - ﻿it cured the nation's trauma from the Yom Kippur War. ﻿In my opinion, completely. We shot down 85 MiGs. ﻿We destroyed 19 batteries. ﻿The people and the world realized ﻿that if you have superior technology developed by the Jewish mind, ﻿then it triumphs. ﻿The military success led to a ceasefire agreement with the Syrians. ﻿Israel is convinced of its power ﻿and sets its sights on destroying PLO headquarters in Beirut. ﻿You see that distant mountain ﻿and the valley in front of it, ﻿in the valley between the distant mountain and the ridge before us, ﻿is the Beirut-Damascus Highway. ﻿To convince government ministers that it's imperative to reach Beirut, ﻿Arik Sharon takes them on a trip to the city outskirts. ﻿I joined the Israeli government ﻿that went to the war zones in Lebanon, ﻿and Sharon explained the maneuvers, ﻿they were very pleased, ﻿got on the two choppers that brought them ﻿and then I heard Defense Minister Sharon ﻿giving orders to open massive fire on Beirut. ﻿Menachem Begin committed to a brief campaign. ﻿48 hours to remove PLO artillery ﻿to a distance of 40 km from the northern towns. ﻿48 hours turned into weeks. ﻿The 40 km guarantee was violated. ﻿IDF soldiers reached the Lebanese capital, Beirut. ﻿The price was heavy. ﻿Dozens of soldiers were killed. Hundreds were wounded. ﻿Come down to us, airplane ﻿Take us to Lebanon ﻿We will fight for Sharon ﻿And return in a coffin ﻿We wanna go home, come on. ﻿You may be aware that parts of the population, ﻿I can't gauge how many, ﻿fear that Defense Minister Sharon caused the government ﻿to deviate from the originally planned operation. . . ﻿Excuse me, Yaakov, I don't say this to you, rather to the journalists ﻿it's a malicious lie. That is not the case. ﻿It‘s idle talk. ﻿Despite the explicit denial, the narrative took root in Israel. ﻿Defense Minister Sharon is the driving force behind the war ﻿and he didn't always tell Begin and the ministers the whole truth. ﻿No one deceived anyone. ﻿You ministers who attended all the government sessions, ﻿you were informed that three divisions were entering Lebanon from various directions. ﻿Didn't you ask yourselves, ﻿if it's 40 km, if it's 24 hours, why three divisions? ﻿The objective was to reach Beirut. ﻿We'll drop a one-ton bomb on any target we decide on, ﻿we'll cut off the power, we won't provide them with fuel. ﻿Let's see who'll last longer. ﻿Was one of the objectives to capture PLO leader Yasser Arafat? ﻿No. ﻿Perhaps prevent him... ﻿from commanding over his armies. ﻿We wanted to bring an end to his command and two other Abus, ﻿Abu Iyad and Abu Zayyad. ﻿As Israeli bombing continues in a futile pursuit ﻿after Yasser Arafat, ﻿U.S. envoy Philip Habib is running back and forth ﻿trying to promote a political solution, ﻿voluntary withdrawal of the terrorists from Lebanon. ﻿Meanwhile, the residents of Beirut are paying the painful price ﻿of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle. ﻿An image was published in the media, ﻿TV, press, ﻿of an Arab girl who lost her hands in the bombings. ﻿Begin was in his office in the Knesset ﻿where he had this niche with a bed ﻿and he went for a nap. ﻿Suddenly his secretary asked me, ﻿"Azriel, what do I do?" ﻿I asked, "What happened?" ﻿"The White House wants the prime minister." I ﻿went in, woke him up ﻿and said, "President Reagan wants you." ﻿It was a harsh conversation. ﻿I think Reagan even mentioned the word "Holocaust." ﻿He said something like, "What you're doing in Beirut is a Holocaust." ﻿"Mr. President, you don't have to teach me what a Holocaust is." ﻿That's the first time I grasped that you can't ignore the media, ﻿not because I'm a bleeding heart, but because war takes place on the screen as well. ﻿If you lose the war on the screen you lose the war. ﻿The American reproach led to a stormy government session. ﻿The defense minister complained, ﻿"It's impossible to explain to every minister what's going on in every house." ﻿The frustrated ministers express their lack of confidence in Sharon ﻿and demand his authorities be restricted: ﻿Begin, though he knows the war is about to end, ﻿raises his hand in favor of the unprecedented decision. ﻿Was this a strategy on Begin's part to assuage the ministers and the U.S. president ﻿or was it a red card to Defense Minister Sharon ﻿who many thought deceived the government and its leader? ﻿I had a longstanding argument, ﻿for many years after I left my office, ﻿with the late Yechiel Kadishai. ﻿He'd listen to my opinions, I never hid them, ﻿that, to put it mildly, ﻿Begin was duped. ﻿He said, "Azriel, you don't understand. ﻿"Begin wanted it, Begin supported it, ﻿"you're all clueless." ﻿We see the first ship sailing ﻿with 400 terrorists on board. ﻿As they leave Beirut, we have completed ﻿the objective for which we set out for this war, ﻿removing the terrorists. ﻿Under the supervisien of an international force, ﻿dozens of ships take the PLO members out of Beirut. ﻿I promised them that this mareh will continue ﻿till we'll be able to establish our independent state, ﻿with its capital, Jerusalem. ﻿Forgive the Sabra expression, ﻿Arafat is a big show-off. ﻿A horrible man, a professional killer, ﻿he merely wanders the world, lives in fancy hotels. ﻿Unlike him, no comparison intended, we too fought in the underground, ﻿none of us left this country, not even for a day, and fought. ﻿Again, no comparison at all. ﻿The last of the exiled is Yasser Arafat. ﻿For Menachem Begin, this is a joyous moment. ﻿Without Arafat in the picture, he is convinced ﻿he can revive the negotiations for the autonomy, ﻿his flagship plan to ensure that Judea, Samaria and Gaza remain whole. And iit doesn't end here. ﻿While PLO members are exiled from Beirut, ﻿in the city's parliament, Lebanon elect's a president, ﻿Bashir Gemayel, commander of the Christian Phalange Party, ﻿our man. ﻿We helped Bashir get elected just by being there. ﻿We brought voters? -Could be. ﻿Perhaps people who couldn't make it, ﻿I'm trying to recall, ﻿couldn't make it without us. ﻿To herald the new era, ﻿Begin and wife Aliza went on vacation in Nahariya. ﻿It is there, n the peaceful north ﻿that the shaky house of cards starts to collapse. ﻿In August '82, Bashir Gemayel ﻿is brought to a Rafael facility outside Nahariya ﻿to meet Menachem Begin ﻿and Begin says, "I expect you ﻿"to sign a peace treaty with us" ﻿and Bashir Gemayel looks at Begin and says, ﻿"I can't sign a peace treaty with you" ﻿and Begin realized it was all built on a lie, ﻿that Israel made good on its deal with the Christians in Lebanon ﻿and will get nothing. ﻿Removal of the bodies from the rubble ﻿of the Phalange headquarters in Achrafieh lasted all night. ﻿The three-story building ﻿collapsed from the force of the 200-kilo bomb ﻿that was presumably activated by remote control. ﻿Two weeks after the meeting with Begin, ﻿Bashir Gemayel, Lebanese president-elect, was murdered. ﻿The terrorist, so it quickly turned out, ﻿was Tanious Shartouni, acting on behalf of the Syrian Intelligence. ﻿Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, whose army was defeated in battle, ﻿succeeded in one act of terrorism ﻿to immerse Israel for many years in the Lebanese mire, ﻿to shatter the illusion that by brute strength ﻿one can shape the Middle East. ﻿This is the Voice of Israel from Jerusalem. ﻿Correspondents in Beirut report on what they call ﻿the slaughter of the Phalangists in the West Beirut refugee camps. ﻿The correspondents indicate hundreds of fatalities. ﻿During the many days that the IDF imposed a siege on Beirut, ﻿the Israelis were not privy to the horrors documented by the foreign media. ﻿Then, with the cruel slaughter carried out by the Phalange fighters, ﻿the Israelis too were exposed to the horrendous toll of the war in Lebanon. ﻿Begin is a murderer! Begin is a murderer! ﻿Heavy public pressure was put on the government that was reluctantly forced ﻿to establish an official inquiry commission, the Kahan Commission. ﻿The prime minister attends the discussions as a subject of interrogation. ﻿Worse, as the saying goes, ﻿comes to worse. ﻿During an official visit to the U.S., ﻿Begin is struck by the most painful news of all. ﻿His wife, Aliza.Begin, has passed away. ﻿"Two weeks before I left, my wife's condition was much improved. ﻿"The doctors were optimistic. ﻿"My son Ze'ev Binyamin was with her Saturday night. ﻿"My wife was in good spirits and he parted with her. ﻿"Aliza, of blessed memory, left us that night ﻿"very suddenly ﻿"and none of her family was with her." ﻿What plans do you have for the future? ﻿Me? ﻿It is really hard to say, because, you see, ﻿all my life I was rather satisfied with what was coming ﻿and was never bored in my life ﻿and sometimes it is really hard to say what you actually want. ﻿Begin met Aliza, nee Arnold, at dinner at her father's home. ﻿"I saw you, you were 17 years old, ﻿"and my heart said, she will be my wife. ﻿"I wrote a letter to the young woman, a one-line letter. ﻿"I saw you, my lady, for the first time, ﻿"yet I felt as if I had known you my entire life." ﻿Women don't cry. ﻿I think that we can't afford it. ﻿It is a luxury. ﻿Perhaps others can do it, ﻿but We can't cry in sorrow because we must be strong ﻿in order to support the men and our children. ﻿After three months of discussions, ﻿the Kahan Commission publishes its conclusions. ﻿A Shin Bet messenger arrived at 7 p.m. ﻿with a brown envelope containing the Kahan report. ﻿I leafed through it ﻿and saw no conclusion about Begin, ﻿but Sharon must go home. ﻿We sat in the prime minister's office and the conclusions were clear. ﻿Everyone said, "You have to send him packing." ﻿"At once." ﻿He sat there, nodded ﻿and said, and I quote, ﻿"Oy, kinderlach, ﻿"it's easy for you to say, I'm the one who has to do it." ﻿Outside the conference room where the cabinet was discussing Sharon's dismissal, ﻿a violent conflict is taking place. ﻿Peace Now protesters against Begin and Sharon supporters. ﻿The windows are closed ﻿otherwise you can't work ﻿with all the yelling and the noise. ﻿Begin is a murderer! ﻿I went over to the northern window, ﻿opened it, looked down, ﻿I couldn't see, I could only hear voices. ﻿Then we heard a boom. ﻿Yona Avrushmi, a right-wing protester, hurls a grenade. ﻿Emil Grunzweig, a Peace Now activist, is killed. ﻿This is a tragedy, I can't do this. ﻿Tell them to be quiet. ﻿What a horrible th ﻿The heart cries for the young man who was murdered. ﻿There is grave dissent among the people, ﻿but we are free citizens in a demecratic state. ﻿We mustn't go down this cursed path of violence. ﻿We mustn't. ﻿The Lebanon mire continues to claim victims. ﻿A protest guard is situated outside the prime minister's residence. ﻿A daily, painful reminder of the tragedy. ﻿One morning he comes t® work, as usual, I entered with him ﻿and he asks me, "Did you read Yoel Marcus today?" ﻿Yoel Marcus, an analyst for Ha'aretz newspaper. ﻿I said, "I did." ﻿And he said, "He's right." ﻿"This government embroiled the ﻿"mortgaged its financial future, ﻿"planted the’seeds of civil war for generations to come ﻿"and it cannot-solve the problems that it created." ﻿August 1983, ﻿one year after euphoria skyrocketed ﻿Begin attends the government session with a decision. ﻿The session was routine. ﻿I'm cabinet secretary, I sit next to him, he runs the session. ﻿Routine government matters... ﻿Towards the end of the session he says, ﻿"I want to make a personal statement." ﻿"I ask for your forgiveness and pardon. ﻿"If these will be granted, I do not know. ﻿"I intend to resign as prime minister. ﻿"I cannot go on any longer." ﻿The curtain came down on dozens of years of public service ﻿for his people, for hi's country. ﻿Then the question followed, where will Menachem Begin go? ﻿He has no home. ﻿The man served his people, his country, for dozens of years ﻿and he has nothing. Where will he go? ﻿So I looked for an apartment for him, ﻿we found one that cost $600 a month, if I remember correctly. ﻿We signed a lease. ﻿Not the state. He did, personally. And he lived out the rest of his days there. ﻿With blood and sweat a new race shall arise ﻿Proud, generous and cruel... ﻿Begin steered the helm of power for six years and three months ﻿that left their mark, for better or for worse, on the current Israeli reality. ﻿Menachem Begin, ﻿Prime Minister of Israel, ﻿I call upon you to come to the rostrum ﻿and receive the gold medal of the Nobel Peace Prize ﻿for 1978.
