?tretat is a small Normandy town. Some people come here for the holidays. Other people live there. I was born there. I found it too small for my taste. Now, I wish I still lived there. I work as a window-dresser. I earn a good living. At this time, almost all my customers are away on holidays. I am in Paris, I have no money problems And I'm free. What are you doing? I'm leaving. When shall I see you again? I don't know. At ?tretat, I would be taken to the Casino to dance. Here, they want my phone number. It's more forthright. I haven't got a phone. But I have a great studio apartment in the garrets near Notre Dame. I'm good-looking. I usually go to bed on the first date when I like a man. Isn't it wonderful? Yet I wish I were in ?tretat. What would I do in ?tretat? Nothing. Here I might do something. I might. His name is Matik. He used to come to ?tretat in summer. He was my first boyfriend. He's my only friend. - Matik! - Yeah! I'm bored. I'd like to escape. Do as I do. Become an actress. Look! I am free. He is an actor. It's the only legal way he found to cheat life. Hello! - You never thought of getting married? - You're crazy! I have lived 22 years in ?tretat. It's worse than marriage. Think of something else. What are you trying to find in Paris? Pleasure, freedom. Ambition. But what did I actually find in Paris? The Select where I meet Matik and the others. My job. Buying and selling unusual objects for shop windows and interior decoration My bed. Unremarkable actually. Lovers. Freedom. A feeling of being alive. But what can I do? So? I seek thrills. There are lots of tourists in Paris and I am all alone. I'd like to be in ?tretat. I don't want to be alone. No, no, I don't want to. No, I won't. No! No! You feel better? I feel sick. Ah, no! I'll take you home. Oh, no! No! Come on! Make an effort! Come lie down. No. Something wrong? I feel sick. I'm feeling better. Thank you. It's nothing. You will be able to go home soon. - No. - You don't want to? No, not right now. Come on! - Careful! The clasp is hard. - There! Married? - Yes. - Children? - No. - Was the bath worth it? I've been married for six years but I'm alone most of the time. - It couldn't go on like this. - Come! It will be o.k. Look! Aren't you pretty? My make-up has run down. What happened to you? It's hard to explain. I love him. Silly to say but I've never known any other man. I will get over it. But tonight I cracked up. If every love story ended in a suicide, no boat could sail on the Seine. Really, you don't have the right to do that in Paris. There are so many men. You're sweet. I'm no trouble? I'm not that easy to trouble. You will sleep here. What about you? On the couch. Trouble is... I left a letter at home. What about? To tell him I was going to kill myself. He would have known it. I don't want him to find it. He's away but he'll be back tomorrow morning. It's all right then. Where do you live? 44, avenue Montaigne What floor? 5th floor, left. The keys are under the doormat. In half an hour, you'll have your letter back. How can I thank you? - Nicole Corradi. - I'm Galia. Really... you've never been unfaithful? There's no morality any more. I find that story entertaining. I feel like a burglar. I'm entering that woman's personal life. I have to know. It can't be true. You don't kill yourself for a man. Well? Anyway, they seem wealthy. Their bedroom. A big love with two single beds. That must be his bed. Seeing what sort of books there is. And that's her bedside table. Medicine for the liver, sleeping pills nouveau roman and other sleeping helps. And on the bed, a see-through nightshirt. and a TV set. It doesn't seem all right. Something doesn't fit in. I'm afraid it's the nightshirt. "My darling, I've loved you as one loves the first time "I don't feel like going away and discovering new horizons. "My road ends in front of the wall you put in my way. "I'd rather die. I kiss you one last time. Nicole." What dumb ass! How irritating! They've got all it takes to be happy: youth, beauty, money. It all goes to waste. He'll think me dead. That'll be his punishment. - What if he finds out the truth? - He won't if you stay here. He'll go to the police. Look, Nicole... You want him to notice you? Let's play games for a few days. Indeed. Go on. Here! You've got relatives? No. No one. When you married him, did he love you? At first, he did. Then he drifted away. Why? You're frigid? I'm not. Does he still fuck you sometimes? I think he's not aroused any more. It may happen. And he sleeps around? In spite of that, you won't divorce? No. You'd rather catch colds? When will he be back? Don't know. Tomorrow or the day after. He is with some girl? That's why you... I'll lie down for a while. Thanks for everything. Sleep well. She slept all day. And tonight, I couldn't wait and we're near her flat. He's home. He'll see you. He's in all right. The lights are on in the living-room and the bedroom. - What shall we do? - Nothing. I'll go tell him. He may be grieving. Unless he's with a girl. I must go up. Thank you, Galia. I'll bring you your clothes back. There's no need. You see, he might be unhappy and... - He is not used to being alone. - Good night, Nicole. Go clean his house. You have a bad opinion... You think it will all change because of a jump in the Seine? Wait and see what he'll do. You'll learn much more that way. You think he'll come back to me? He might. But don't come back to life that fast. It might be him. What will you do? Don't leave me. I need someone to take care of me. Galia? Galia? Oh, Galia, here you are. Yes. You've slept here? It was too hot. The night was wonderful. Shall I make you a cup of tea? Yes. Tea is in a candy box. I wonder how he will react. You don't seem to know men. - No, I don't know them. - Yes, that's right. It's hot already, isn't it? He will worry. He must be crying right now. And you're upset. You want to bring him solace? No, I'm glad. I've decided to stay here and see what happens. I'd like to know he is crying. I wouldn't have died for nothing. Feeling better this morning, aren't you? I like it here. It feels as if I were on holidays. Galia! I want to know what he is like when he thinks me dead. All right! I'm not fully awake yet but I think I got it. His office is not far from the Opera. Place Vend?me. His shop is at number 8. Jewels, diamonds, art gallery. He goes out at 1 but doesn't have lunch at home. According to what his wife said he is six feet tall. He is good-looking. I remember his photograph. Quite ordinary, I hope I'll recognize him. I'm curious to see him. That's him! The suicide is right, he is good-looking. His wife's disappearance doesn't seem to affect him. Has he told the police? He looks serious but not worried. He doesn't seem to have been crying all night. Yet he hasn't slept much. Or he is hungry. He was hungry. Basta! He was expected at the swimming-pool. I'm late, darling. Here, look! He was not expected any more actually. Anyway, the flowers were not for her. Very pretty. - Yes. - That's right. You... - Aren't you going for a swim? - I can't. It's hard to recognize someone. I can't see who it can be. Did he look his normal self? Too much! I can't stand that sort of male. He thinks he can get any girl. "Come this way! Here I am!" He's good-looking, isn't he? If you like the type, yes. I don't. How hot it has been. - You didn't notice anything else? - No. He is not crying. There it is! It was just delivered. Afterwards, there's "Le Monde " at 4. - There will be nothing there either. - Come on! Don't lose hope. He didn't believe my letter. - Why? You often disappear? - Oh no! He'll believe it eventually. "The body of a naked woman has been found in the Bois de Vincennes." No, that's not you. "A young woman attempted... That's not you either. Listen! "Missing people". Little moustache. You won't find it. "She loved him too much, she kills him." That's good. The other must always go first. He won't tell anything. What nerve! He throws you in the water and that's it! Leave me alone! Come on, Nicole! He knew you were down. He is the criminal. And he doesn't care. - He's right. I'm not dead. - That's true. But you almost died. You saw him the next day. It was too soon. I'm sure he's worried sick today. If he's found the letter. There's no one else. The servants are on holidays. Right! So today, I'll meet him... You're very kind. You don't mind, do you? No. I find your disconsolate quite intriguing. Galia, come back quickly. I feel lonely when you're away. You must choose: the private detective or the companion. Or you can come with me. Thank you but I've got things to read. Here we are! She got what she wanted. We carry on with the investigation. She is sad but nice. She hasn't been out for four days. She doesn't talk too much. It's all right. I can do with her. She wears those of my clothes that fit her and she cleans the house. In effect, it's convenient. Excuse me! Excuse me! Can you tell me how to go to Matik Street? - Which street? - Matik. No, I don't know. It's a real problem. I must find it. Can you help me? Go into that shop. They will tell you. They've got a map. It's somewhere around. It can't be far from here. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Nicole! Try to help that young lady. The flowers are for her. We now have the Triumph International bathing suits. Number two is of green cloth. More of the new Triumph International bathing-suits numbers 7. 3, 8 and 13. Musical, Lido, Senorita, Jacky. Triumph International the new rage on all the beaches. Now pretty Ursula is showing you Number 9. And now, still there, Eve. Eve is a new bathing-suit made by Triumph International. A suit made of a net in which she'll take... We're sorry to have to interrupt our show for a while. Oh, sorry! Hey, it's you! - Did you find your street? - Which street? You were place Vend?me looking for a street, weren't you? Yes, it might be. There are so many of them. Why? You're interested? No, but you seemed so worried. It happens to me. Especially in stormy weather. The rain took you by surprise, right? Not you? In a mirror, you can only kiss on the mouth. Try! Aren't you tempted? No. Afraid to get wet? Oh, it's you. Alone? Your girlfriend doesn't like water? No, she's just her hair done. I think she's angry. Because we're going out together tonight? Maybe. You're hesitating? You're afraid? Maybe. Well, never mind. Look at that! She's coming to you in spite of the rain. Where? When? 9 o'clock, in Montparnasse, at the Select. O.K. To think that he is the reason why Nicole wanted to kill herself. You're back? I didn't hear you come in. You can congratulate me. So? So, we got acquainted, as people say. And...? No. We didn't speak about you. We're meeting for dinner tonight. Maybe. Why maybe? Because it's not sure. And I don't really feel like going. Can you shut the window? I'm cold. It's cooler now because of the storm. Something wrong, Galia? I don't know. I must have caught cold. I don't like your husband. He?s too sure of himself. He is tall, handsome, funny when he feels like it. And luck is on his side. He gets everything he wants. He is dangerous. No need to worry. We're incompatible. And I have what I need at hand. A whole network. Strange, I'd give anything for him not to come. Are you all right? Are you all right? Not in your best mood, are you? Tomorrow will be better. I feel quite ill at ease. I feel like leaving. But I have vowed to find out what he was thinking. You've kept those talents hidden from me. Can I see? Imagine his reaction... No, some other time. But didn't he see it? What are you having? Hello, Hello... Doudou is wanted on the phone. Let's go, shall we? Good, I'm starving. Where can we have dinner around here? - Trust me. - Coming! - How much is it? - 1.60 How can I make him confide into me? The wine or the pillow? I can't imagine myself on his pillow. He is all that I hate: the man sure of his attraction and of his tailor. The wine maybe. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Thank you. Excuse me. - Good evening, madam. - Good evening. To me, Paris is the Montparnasse area. I'll never leave it. We probably don't like the same people. It's different for me. I have commitments so I go out quite often. A lot of women? As every self-respecting married man. - What about your wife? - I'd rather not speak of her. What will you regret on your deathbed? I won't regret anything. I will be mad. I'll rage to say to myself: "So long, Galia. I liked you." What about you? I'll feel a huge grief. I love life. What about your friends' death, your wife's? What about my wife? Would her death affect you? You've spoken about her twice. It's an obsession. I mustn't? Hey, Wespyr! Who is he? An important man. Lots of money, knows everyone. His name is Wespyr. I would like to talk to him. There's another room? Downstairs, it's the classy part. Let's go there. I can't, I'm wearing trousers. That would be in bad taste. He is bored and so am I. Who cares? The affair ends before dessert. Look! If you want to join him, go. I won't mind. But on your own. You never wear a dress when you go out for dinner? Congratulations, my dear Corradi. He looks friendlier after he's emptied his bladder. Mr. Wespyr, may I introduce miss Galia? Galia, meet my greater friend. - Isn't it true, Mr. Wespyr? - It's not nice here. Join me at my table. With pleasure. Shall we, Galia? Greg, you know I can't. Why not? I'm wearing trousers. He's ashamed of me. He's wrong. You're really charming. Do come, Miss. Thank you, no. I'm embarrassed. Pity! - Good night, Greg. - Good night. You do that on purpose? I don't like your friend's looks. Hush down! You want him to hear? I'm quite able to. Greg! Come to my place tomorrow. I have some friends coming. I'd be pleased. Bring the young lady. If she's free, of course. I'd be delighted. I have the feeling that if I don't come with you tomorrow, you won't be most welcome. You notice everything, don't you? He's always interested in other men's women? - When they're pretty. - Is your wife pretty? She is. That's Boubi, my dog. He's dead. Here's my wife. Sorry... She's beautiful. Very beautiful. Where is she now? On holidays. She's resting at relatives' in the country. She's living with an uncle, a real comedian. Is she? Can you lend me her picture till tomorrow. I want to draw her portrait. I like it very much. Thank you. My car's over there. Will you come tomorrow? Maybe. Come pick me up here at 9. You'll find out. - Why not at your place? - Because I shall be here. Galia! It's a dressed-up party. Wear a gown. I'll bring you your wife back. The sketch and the picture. See you tomorrow. Not a good day! Galia! Back at last. So? So what? Did you see him? Whom? Please Galia, tell me. All right... I've seen him. And Wespyr likes me a lot. What? Wespyr was there? Greg had brought him along? It was a chance encounter. A chance encounter? Yes, it was. What sort of relationship does your husband have with Wespyr? Greg would like to have him as a partner. Why did you overreact when I said we'd met him? I don't like the man and Greg's deference to him. It's more than deference. There's another name for it. He didn't like Wespyr looking at me. Quite the contrary. He's invited us to come to his house tomorrow. He makes me uneasy. I must have seen too many horror movies. He makes me think of a vampire. Galia! - Did Greg talk about me? - Excuse me, but I had bad feelings. All he said was that you were at the country house of a comedian uncle. If only I had one. I'd have gone to him. He also gave me your picture. I have to make your portrait. - He had a picture of me? - And his dog's too. Yes. That's right. Even if you get him back, Nicole, he'll give you a real hard time. I know that. I love him. And... living alone is difficult, Galia. It may be. I'm going to bed. Nicole! I'm glad that you're here tonight. You know... if you don't want to go to that party... No, it's over. I don't like leaving things half-finished. Nothing ever happens to me. Hello, you! You don't have a phone line yet? - Pity. - Why? What did you have in mind? Nothing. It's going to be a long evening. - How pretty you are! - Who? - You. - Me? Indeed. I'll come on to you. - There are other girls. Try them. - You're crazy. I never do. I never hit on a girl. Afterwards she reproaches me with it. I'm seeing a man of the world. No. You can stay. You're sure? - I'm buying. - As usual? Waiter! A beer grenadine and white wine with blackcurrant. Matik, you're getting fatter. What? - You've got a big head. - You're at it again! - No but you've got a big head. - I've got a big head. - Who is this for? - The lady. There he is. - A scotch whisky. - Matik... this is Greg. I'd give a lot to know if he's told the police. - Leaving us? - I am, yes. Here! Your lighter! Can I be straight, Galia, without upsetting you, I'll take you to Wespyr's but in another dress. It is pretty but not smart enough. I haven't got any other. Let's go elsewhere. Some friend will lend you one. I haven't got any friend. - How tall are you? - 5.6 Good! I've got an idea. Choose. Which is your wife's favorite gown? That one. - I'll let you change. - I don't mind your being here. Can you unhook my dress, please? I'd like to fix my hair. The bathroom is over there. Look! There must be a pair of shoes to go with it. You're some girl! You look totally changed. That gown is my gift to you. Don't be upset! It suits you so perfectly. It belongs to your wife. She won't notice it. Besides... What? Nothing. Good evening, Miss. Your coming to that party is a pleasant surprise. I invited a few intimate friends. My dear Greg, my wife and I are delighted to have you here. I thank you for your kind invitation. He was invited because of me. But he doesn't mind and he is delighted. Better still! He feels at home. Where's the buffet? - You're hungry? - Very. Oh! It's Greg. I'm so happy to see you. In a gown or in trousers, you're as charming. I really like that gown. It really suits you. I'm going to the U.S. for a few days on a business trip. I'd really like to see you again. I'll tell Greg to fix it. Thank you for helping me to escape. I missed you. - It's almost true. - They're not fun. - You wanted to come here. - Business is business, you know... No one asks you about your wife. The important thing is to be seen with a pretty girl. We ended the night at the wholesale market. I was famished. He gave me some flowers. I gave him Nicole's portrait. Extraordinary! It's really her. It's yours. You'll show it to her? Tell me, Galia... Would you like to spend the week-end with me? If you agree, ring me tonight. We'll leave tomorrow afternoon. You're awake? I didn't sleep. I've waited for you all night. You recognize it? It was Greg's gift for my latest birthday. He didn't like my dress so he took me to your place. Galia! - Did Greg... - No, don't worry. He didn't even think about it. He was in too much of a hurry to get to Wespyr's. Say... He never asked you to go to bed with Wespyr? Don't be silly. He is as he is. But he is not scurvy. No but after living five years with him, all you want is jump in the water. What are you doing up there? Come! I've got a window to make this morning. I have just enough time for a shower. Stop playing. He wants us to go away for the week-end. You didn't say yes? Why? I must finish the job. And I can take care of myself. What if I told you not to go? Don't ever say that to me, Nicole. I left ?tretat for much less. I know where he'll take you. If he likes you a little: Fontainebleau. Much: Deauville. And if he likes you very much: Amsterdam. Or maybe Venice to impress you. Isn't it, darling? Already been to Venice? No. You like? Yes. - When shall we go back to Paris? - We've just arrived. The last time I came here, I was with a Danish girl. And she did dine in the bedroom? She didn't have dinner. Sorry but I can't bear sitting such a long time at a table. - But... - No, please, have your coffee. There! Why? - I don't want you to go away from here. - O.K. What time is it? What does it matter? Come! What are you doing? I'm too hot. I want you dressed in white. But I've got nothing under my sweater. So what? Come on, we've got a plane to catch. Couldn't we stay two more days? No, hurry up! I've got important appointments. Today is Sunday and everything's closed. Couldn't we stay two more days? You phone me in the morning, preferably at about 11. See you one of these days! Ciao! I hoped I'd see him tonight. It was Venice. So it was Hotel Gabrieli. Bravo! It's not funny. You don't feel like laughing now? You're to meet or is he to phone? No, I must ring him. There's no phone here. I moved the furniture. Do you like it? Are you ashamed to undress in front of me now? It was only a week-end. Only a week-end. A girl he picked up at the swimming pool. A girl for the week-end. No more! How sad is Venice! There's a bruise on your thigh. I knocked my thigh against a gondola. Gondolas aren't comfortable at all. But there's nothing else there. Nicole! Leave me alone! - It was nothing. - With him, it's always nothing. He always does it again and I have no existence. I have no existence, Galia! - How old are you? - 25. - I'm 10 years older. - So what? It doesn't matter. - It's time I started... - What? - Having an existence. - Don't be silly! Did you take your sleeping pill? Here! Sleep well. Sorrow suits her. Tonight, she's very pretty. Too pretty maybe. - Hi! - An espresso and a phone token. Here you are. The phone booth occupied. - What time is it? - 5 to 11. Oh, sorry. It's busy. You seem in a hurry. I'll let you use it. - No luck. Busy too. - I'm sorry for you. Great! I got an answer! Hello, aunt Marcelle... An espresso and a token, please. All right, Greg. All right. Yes, I was free for dinner tonight. It doesn't matter. Very well. Tomorrow night, 8, at the Select. Ciao! You're sure it'll be ready for tomorrow at 7. Yes, no problem. - Yes, no problem. - 7 tomorrow. 7 tomorrow, yes. We said it'd be ready at 7. Hello? Hello? Claude Repert is asked on the phone. - Hello, Galia. - No phone call for me? No, I already told you. Galia! You scared me. Going to a wedding? You're expecting someone. What time is it? Nine fifteen. Say! You don't come around any more. Are you in love? Maybe. That's your business. It's an experience as good as any other. - Always busy. - I know that. Yet, here it's like home to you. I've known days when, from bar to bar, from busy to "not free", I could drink some twenty glasses of white wine. When I could at last talk to the lady, I was pissed. Why don't you go? It's Viviane. No, it's not her. We had a date today. What day is it? Thursday. I've waited for 2 hours at the Select. I apologize but my memory is not so good these days. Good evening, sweetie. You want a drink? Not here! You're not mad, are you? I'm broad-minded. See you tomorrow. Without fail! See you tomorrow night, 8, at the Select. - I'll explain it all. - There's no need. It's quite clear. Having fun. It's Thursday. Hello! Well... Greg? Viviane! It's great! Come on! Quick! Quick! Good night! Ciao! Back already? Did you have dinner? - I'm not hungry. - Don't you want an omelet? I'm not hungry. Where are the sleeping pills? On the bedside table. Nice dress! Your hair is nicely done. It suits you. Greg was nice? Adorable. He wanted me to stay but I had a splitting headache. Because of the hairdresser. Yes, of course! He may be early. I haven't seen his car. No. He isn't here. Those last two days, I have realized that one minute can be a long time. I have realized how boring other people can be. In this bar, right now, there are a few men with whom I spent a few hours in bed. It seems a long time ago. A coffee. You don't look too well these days. - Ciss?! How is business? - It's fine. - He's not often on time. - Please, leave me alone. Hello? Hello? A phone call for miss Galia. Hello. Hello, Galia. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm O.K. - I'm tired. Would you come to my place? Are you alone? I'm coming. Is that you, Galia? Can you lock the door? Are you coming? That's very kind of you. I really wanted to see you. Come here! Excuse me! - I heard the bell. - Who are you? What are you doing here? I live here. I'm one of Galia's relatives. A relative? What does that mean? She never said anything about you. Things have changed here. "Watch out, lad" - Yes. It's for Galia. - What does it mean? It's a signal we have when one sees that the other is doing something stupid. Galia is doing something stupid? Galia at the hairdresser's. Dresses. High-heel shoes in summer. She is in love, it's obvious. Yes. You know who he is? Yes, my husband. Fancy that! And you're here while... While she is at my place. Obviously. No hard feelings about yesterday. I'd promised I'd spend the evening with Wespyr. And girls. You must understand certain things. He is an important man. I need him. You see, I'm straight with you. What are you doing? I'm undressing. You want me to leave? I've got five minutes. Dear Galia, I'm not 20 any more. Do you understand, Galia? I had a very busy day and yesterday, I went to bed late because of Wespyr. But if you're free tomorrow night... You know where I was? Of course! I expected you for dinner. I cooked a chicken. You're not asking anything from me? I'm not interested any more. So, what does all this mean? I don't want to dine alone, that's all. Do you intend to stay here long? Why? Just to know. At first, I didn't mind but... now... You won't throw me out, will you? - You want to eat? - I'm not hungry. Tell me, Nicole... Did you really want to commit suicide? Yes, Galia. I really wanted to die. And now? Now, I'm hungry. Nicole! You've got to tell him the truth. Me? No way! Now, you're in a much better position than I am to do it. You're doing me a big favor, Galia. Which one? You're the perfect girl. You entertain my husband and you suffer in my place. I've made up my mind. Tonight, I'll tell him the truth. Are you all right? Your watch is fast today? I must apologize. I know, I was really ill-mannered these days. I don't usually act that way. I don't know what's with me. I care for you but I'm cumbersome. So I seem cynical. Can you forgive me? I'm happy to see you. Why are you so formal? I'm not used to you. You'll be, soon.. Here! This is for you. From now on, you can come to my place whenever you want. I feel so happy with you. As you don't want me to come to your place... I don't even know where you live. Take it! No hard feelings? All is forgotten. Yes, but there's more. In three weeks, I'll leave France for three months. New York first, then Miami. With you, if you want to. But what about your wife? Galia, I must confess something. I'll tell you in a while. Let's drink to our trip first. Hello? Hello? Hello? Very annoying! I can hear someone breathing. That's it! They hung up. You fool! I must tell you something, Galia. My wife is not at her parents'. They're dead. She left me. She's vanished. She killed herself? No, I don't think so. She's already left the house leaving a suicide note. I've had at least half a dozen letters of that kind. She was usually back after two days. That letter was written more than one week ago. Her suicide lasts longer. You think she'll come back? Of course! As usual! Killing oneself takes courage. Nicole is weak. I am weak too. I feel so good with him. I'll tell him later. Later. What time is it? - Six. - Can I phone? Of course. What's the problem? You're not free for the week-end? It's awful. I'm not sure I must tell you. Yes, say it. Quickly! So? I had finally decided to tell the police. They phoned me one hour ago. My wife was recovered from the Seine. I must go to the morgue, quai de la Rap?e. Come and join me there. It's impossible! I left her home alone this morning. Something wrong, Miss? I don't know. The fool! I hope she has not tried again. Nicole! Nicole! What's with you, Galia? She's alive, thank God. As I go to that appointment with Greg, as I get nearer to the morgue. a strange idea slips into my head. Hey, doll, falling asleep? Let's not get mad! I fight it away, but it keeps coming back. It settles inside me. Nicole would have been better off at the bottom of the river. She remained in the water for 8 days. She was hit by a barge. Unfortunately, there's no doubt. It's my wife indeed. I've lived with her for six years. I know her by heart. And everything matches. The day. The age. The hair. Nicole! I've got bad news for you. You're dead. Well! Well! Since when? Since you wrote the letter. - How did I die? - As you wished to. In the Seine. Your body was recovered this morning. - My body was identified? - Without any hesitation. It wasn't easy. Your face had been damaged by a propeller. Who identified it? Greg? - Yes. - Bastard. - You're not kidding me? - Not at all. For him, for everybody, now, it is as if you were dead. I suddenly think that, if she vanished for good, no one could accuse no one. Life is not much. Death is nothing at all. Even Nicole's? Hey, what about the bread? It will be closed. Where's the baker's? Let's walk up to the root. Look! Good evening, madam. Good evening. Get it. If it's a woman, talk nonsense. If it's a man... Hello, madam. No, he is not here. He's dining out with his mistress. I am the new maid. Is there a message? All right! I'll tell him you want to go to bed with him. You don't have to be ashamed. It's normal. In that heat! It was some Myl?ne. That's my aunt. She asked about Nicole? I said you went looking for her. - Shall I help you with the cooking? - No, please. Take your bath. What's wrong? I can't help thinking about Nicole. Especially here. Do you still love her? Nicole died the day I met you. - But you feel sad. - Of course. Poor Nicole! She was unable to be happy. - Think of something else. - It's not that easy. I've never been a widower before. There are lots of things to do. The burial, the papers... She was very wealthy, you know... You are her heir? What? If my poor mother knew that. It's a very complicated business. I made her invest her money. And I made her earn... a lot. But, as all inheritances, it's quite complicated. How shall I get out of it? What are you saying? Nothing. How long must Italian noodles cook? Calling them noodles is shame, despair. You must say pasta. La pasta. Sorry, I had forgotten. How long do you cook la pasta? What? You said "Tu". Let's celebrate! - It's funny? - What is? You are! You're sorry? Not at all! It feels like I'm on holidays. It's great! In two weeks, we shall be on the boat. New York, that's for good? Of course! But it will also be a business trip. And you know, I want to forget everything: My office, Paris and the rest. All of it. So do I. I'm hungry. You're looking lovely! I'm sure you'd be embarrassed to wear one of her dresses now. - It's hot. - We must forget it all. As no one knows us in New York, I'll say you're my wife. It won't be far from the truth. It will be true soon after. - Greg! - Yes. What if Nicole were still alive? - You might have made a mistake at the morgue. - Impossible! Why didn't you ask for a divorce? I've tried 50 times. She's always refused. I'm an Italian. There was nothing I could do. Some days, I almost felt like killing her. I'm sure of one thing. If Nicole were alive, we could never be happy. - No one can do anything to us. - She could. She hated to see other people happy. Especially me. If she were here, she'd try to make us split up. Answer it. Hello? Is it aunt Myl?ne? - It's aunt Sophie. - Oh! I'm sorry, he is busy. Yes. No. It will be quite long. - You jumped from here? - Yes. - Only crazy people do that. - He made me get crazy. What now? I'm not so impressive now. Fortunately. - What will you do? - I don't know. I'm legally dead. - Not quite! - Nearly. Nicole, go home as fast as possible. - Galia thought that... - She doesn't think any more. Think in her place. Where are you? At the morgue. You didn't know Nicole. For you, she was only a picture. And think... Think that if she were alive, we'd wish her dead. No! She threatened to kill herself or to kill me a hundred times. Providence made it that she was the one to die. What she does, she does well. Believe me! - Shall I drive you home? - No. I'd rather not. I know, I know, Galia! You're hiding something from me, aren't you? One day, I'll hide and follow you. If you do that... If I do that, what will happen? If you do that, you'll see a studio with a bed, a shower and a kitchen. I won't see anything else, really? Is that you, Galia? I was waiting for you. You were waiting for me? What do you mean? Who else could I wait for? What did you do today? Many things. Don't you want to know what I've been doing? You don't owe me an explanation. Nice of you to bring me one of my dresses back. I spent the evening with Greg at your house. He was nice to you? Of course! Good for you then! Why didn't he ask you to stay the night? It's strange. Even dead, I'm an inconvenience. You wouldn't accept a divorce. Greg hasn't got a cent. I have all the money. He won't split up with my money. Don't believe what he says. I thought you were free and invulnerable. I don't like women, Nicole. Neither do I, Galia. - You've never slept with a girl? - No, never. Not even to please Greg? Never! Nicole! Why did you try to kill yourself? You were used to his indifference and to his unfaithfulness. What made you do it? I feel sleepy. Good night! Don't forget your sleeping pills. I don't need them. You say so... and you wake me up in the middle of the night. Take one. If you want me to. Take one. It replaces many things. No! Leave me alone! Greg! No! No! No. It's not possible. Providence! Providence, Galia! Providence, Galia! It's not possible. Nicole! Watch out! Watch out! No! Nic... Nicole! Nicole? No light! Well, Galia? Will you make up your mind? Come! You'll catch cold. You look calmer this morning. Yes, I feel all right. - What time is it? - You're in a hurry? Yes. I'll tell him the truth. What happens next? He'll make a choice. You or me. And if it's you? You'll divorce him. If you wish so, Galia. He may be sincere. It seems that he loves you. But the only thing he cares about is money. He'd put his ambition before everything else. Possibly. And I'll help him. You're ready for everything? Even intimate parties with Wespyr? I hope he won't ask me to be part of that. Do you think he didn't he ask me? What? Wespyr? One's got to have a good reason to jump in the water. He's not really bad but he has his own way of thinking. Galia, I'd like to protect you. Even I accept a divorce, he will never divorce me. All he wants is my money. Nicole, he told me he wants a divorce. Of course, it's safe for him to say so since I'm dead. When I killed myself, the situation changed. My husband has become my heir. If he identified any corpse at the morgue, it's to get my money sooner. Else, he would have to wait five years if I had vanished. You never thought of that. You live a great romance. I was there with nothing to do, I had time to think. If he knew I was still alive, it would be a real blow for him. Tell him that I am alive and you'll see if he still wants a divorce. Go! And good luck! Luck indeed! - Are you coming? - No, leave me alone. I'd like to go for a walk but on my own, it's no fun. Are you coming? All right. You found your adventure. You know, love seems unremarkable to those who are not in love. Look! It seems to be your lover. What's wrong with you? Don't worry. I know her. I know she's hiding at your place. I've seen them together here several times. If I'd told you, you wouldn't have believed me. You had to see them. Ah, it's you! What a pleasant surprise! You're early. You've been here long? Care for a drink? I've already been drinking. What's wrong? You don't look well. Anything new? Nothing pleasant. I arranged the funeral. It's more difficult to find a burial place than a parking space. Poor Greg! Those are unpleasant moments. In a few days, we'll leave. You still agree? Of course! Wespyr's waiting for us in New York. You will meet Wespyr? Of course! I'm going there for him. Didn't I tell you? No. No? We never have time to talk. We'll live at his house in New Jersey. It will be great! Unless we can't go. I saw you at the Botanical Garden. Well, it's better. I begged her to grant me a divorce. - She won't. - Yes, she wants to. - It's not true. - Yes, it's true. You won't divorce her. You'd lose everything. I see you believe her. The only solution for you is Nicole's death. But she's dead. She drowned. She left a letter. Her body was found. There's no problem now. But... The only problem is that there's a woman too many. And one day she'll come and say who she is. But suppose she was in an accident before she can say it. No one will think it's Nicole since Nicole is dead. She can be any one except Nicole. She'd remain an anonymous body whom no one would identify. Do you understand? You don't want us to live happy together? Yes? Nicole! Nicole! Nicole! - Is Nicole in? - No. - We were to meet... - We must find her. He wants to kill her. Hello, Greg? Greg? Say something. Greg! Hello! Hello, Galia? I loved him too, Galia. It was the only way to save you. - You'd have been living in hell. - No! Don't hold it against me. I tried everything. I saw him without your knowing. I agreed to divorce him. But he wanted me to disappear. He hoped that you'd drive me to suicide or that you'd kill me. Now it's over. I'm almost happy, Galia. I'll live with no anxiety. Free from him. Leave me alone, Greg! Leave me alone! Be nice. Go away! Stop torturing me, Greg. Be a good guy, go away! I feel already so cold on the pebbles of ?tretat beach.
