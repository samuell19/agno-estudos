[hip-hop music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - Oakland, make some noise. [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ Yes. ♪ ♪ Oh, we in here. It's a special. And I had to come to Oakland. Make some noise for the Bay area, man. Make some noise for the Bay area. Yeah! Whee! Oakland, man. Yeah. I like Oakland 'cause y'all smart. But y'all go dumb. Y'all got a good energy. Y'all humble. 'Cause there's crack heads next door. You can't... [laughter] You can't act like you better than me if you saw a crack head today. [laughter] You're not. One side of the block look like "Pleasantville." The other side, "Walking Dead." It's a bunch of crack zombies. Is that Ms. Johnson? I didn't know she turned. Damn. We done lost another one. Look at her. Mrs. John--Hey, Mrs.-- Oh, Mrs. Johnson. Damn. That was so black, it hit me in my soul. Did you have Ms. Johnson? Like, did-- Was she your teacher? I seen Ms. Johnson two weeks ago, brother. I didn't know--I didn't know I was the only one who seen her. [laughter] But y'all hear it. I'm from LA. South Central is in the building. Make some noise if you-- if you've been there, if you've seen it. I mean, that's my first magic trick. Making it out. Just being here today. But I'll be honest. I'm gonna be 100% honest. I'm not from that South Central. But that's why they call me, you know, Mr. Hood Adjacent, 'cause that's who I am. Hood adjacent. Like, here's the hood. Drive-bys, gang banging. Looks like an episode of "The Wire." Then there's a street, then me. Ooh, dodged it. Get out of here, oppression. "Matrix"! Almost got me. Thank you, Mom. It's like, yes, I know the dude who got shot in the drive-by, but no, I wasn't invited to the retaliation meeting. I don't know what our response is to this dude shooting up the street next to the one I care about. But I told him, "Hey, when you find the guy who did this, "do what y'all do. Keep it gangsta. "Take a picture of it, put it on Instagram, "and I'll like that shit. I'll hit it with the double tap." But that's where it stops. Hood adjacent. I make my Kool-Aid with Fiji Water and a touch of Splenda. Just a skosh. Just a dollop. Way more crisper to the palate. You know what it tastes like? Progress. [laughter] An extra five years on your life. ♪ Moving on up ♪ ...in a cup. [laughter] I had a lot of friends. They were, uh, gang members. Uh, Bloods, Crips. I was in a gang as well. All-black Boy Scout troop. Um... Troop 848. Y'all laughing, but don't get it twisted. They ran the streets. We ran the woods. [laughter] Whole lot of gang shit, you know what I mean? [laughter] All-black Boy Scout troop. We looked like a cross between the baby Black Panthers and the Little Rascals. Just a bunch of Buckwheats in the woods just pitching tents, throwing rocks, and terrorizing squirrels. Get out of our tent site, cuz! Get out, cuz, it's ours! 848! Hey, cuz, I'm lost. You lost? North star, north star. We good. [laughter] It's right there, cuz. Right by the little dipper. [laughter] Do you even read your book? [laughter] All-black Boy Scout troop. This is what made me mad. They made us wear kente cloth Boy Scout scarves. Now, for those who don't know, let me be a niggapedia. Kente cloth is like African tribal Burberry. It's like... [laughter] Flannel for the culture. If you've ever been to a college graduation and you noticed a little something extra on the black people's graduation gown, you know what that little extra credit is? Kente cloth. And they made us wear it on our Boy Scout uniform. Now, listen. We already look like junior UPS niggas. Like, now--now we got a piece of Africa on the uniform as well? This is unnecessary. They know we're the black troop. [laughter] We have Jordans on instead of hiking boots. [laughter] Are there any Boy Scouts in here tonight? Straight up. [laughs] [laughter] But enough about me, man. Let's talk about you guys. I appreciate you coming out. You look good. Make some noise for yourselves. You look good. [cheers and applause] I appreciate that. You know, some places, they be coming looking like they--like they did yard work and then me, you know? Like, I'm not something you do in between errands, you know? You don't do laundry and then check out James. I'm a goddamn event, okay? Don't you come seeing me with your toes all out and your braids undone. But that's not--Y'all don't have to worry about that. Y'all look good. You, sir, I see you with the camo. Where'd you go? I can't see you. [laughs] Okay. That's that good camo. I can't--Where's he at? Where's he at? I--Where--Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Got that good camouflage. Okay. Looking like a floating face. My point is, y'all look good, man. Some cities, they be disrespectful. I'm not talking about any place in particular. Chattanooga. But, you know. Yeah, they didn't come to play. But you guys, you look good. You look like a room full of profile pictures. Perfectly cropped. I don't know what filter y'all are wearing. Y'all got a nice hue about you. I appreciate that. 'Cause you know when you say someone looks like their profile picture, that's a compliment. 'Cause a profile picture, that's our best swing in the photography department. That's the best picture you've taken in the last 10 to 15 years. I love the profile picture 'cause you could always tell somebody's problem areas. 'Cause they always crop out their bullshit. Have you noticed that? If they got a messed-up haircut, their picture starts right at the eyebrow and makes its way down. If they ain't been on their crunches, it's getting a little loosey-goosey downstairs, chin, lot of ceiling. Lot of architecture. Is that stained glass back there? That's a beautiful home. Where is that? What area code? And if they're ugly, just the eyes. Have you seen that one? The just the eyes? Did I get a friend request from a ninja? Who are you, eyeballs? [laughter] There's too many old people on Facebook. Can we just say that? Can we just put that out there? Too many. Remember when it was-- Remember when it was just for us? And our college friends? Now it's all-- they just keep on coming. They're like the illegal aliens of the Internet. These old people. We need to put up a wall or some trivia. [laughter] Something. Who's Lil Wayne? You don't know? Then you don't fucking log on, okay? This is young people's town. Which one of these is not a dance? You know, just something. [laughter] I got a friend request from my grandfather. I was like, "No." Like, I'll see you at Grandma's house. I don't wanna see no old people posts like, uh, "Just, uh, finished watching "M.A.S.H." Like, I don't wanna see that. "About to 'Wheel of Fortune' and chill." You know? "With my old lady." "Just woke up from a nap. Praise God." Like... [laughter] "Just woke up from a nap again. I'm on a streak." Like... [laughter] I don't wanna see that. Listen, here's my thing. Old or young, if you're gonna be on social media, you gotta understand the rules. The guidelines. Like, simple stuff. Like, the difference between wall talk and inbox talk. When to slide up in the DMs and when to make it public. It's very simple. Like, wall talk, that's that general stuff. Hey, how you doing? Saw the feed. Happy birthday. Wanna go to James Davis' comedy show? Something all the Internet can see and you can breathe easy. Inbox is that nasty stuff that no one should ever know about. That's why it's in a box. [laughter] Like, this is an inbox message I may have sent the other day. Hey, baby girl. I had a daydream about you. You were butt naked. I put some Lawry's seasoning salt on your ass. Then licked it off for a midday snack. Send. [laughter] That's how I send my DMs. Get out there. Wi-Fi, do your thing. [laughter] Now, listen. Some of y'all are laughing, and others are troubled. [laughter] But guess what? That was between me and the freak I sent it to. And where was it? In a box. For no one else to see. But you can't confuse the two. I remember I went to a house party. Some things went down. It was amazing. The next day, my boy writes on my wall, "Oh, girl from last night. Did you hit that?" all: [oohing] On my wall. [laughter] In my public space. For my aunts and uncles to see. [laughter] Now the whole feed thinks I'm hoeing. And then my grandpa goes, likes this. [laughter] I don't need that. I don't need that drama, yo. No. It's funny, but it's not. I don't need granddaddy issues. I already got daddy issues. Speaking of fathers--father figures in the black community. Make some noise for Barack Obama. I miss him. Right? Where is he at? Right? You have that, "Aww," right? It's sad. I feel like me and him broke up, and, like, he's doing good and he's happy. And he's doing a good job, you know, and whatever. But, like, come home. You know? Like, come on, dawg. Just come on home. You know? It's--It's weird. But I'm happy for him. He's so relaxed. Have you seen him? He's relaxed. Like... You know, like... Like, we over here like-- [groans] And he's like-- [exhales sharply] [laughter] It's like, we got homework, and he don't. Like, we're in finals, and he dropped out three months ago. Like, "Ooh, it looks bad over there. "We playing '2K' over here. She rolling up. Come through." And we're like, "Oh, I can't. I gotta deal with all this life stuff." And it's like, "Oh, that sucks. "You should have been President for eight years. Then you could just chill." [laughter] No, he just--his energy is so amazing right now. Whenever he walks into any event, it looks like he just finished fucking. Right? Like he has the most emptiest nuts in the room. Like, that's-- that's Barack's swag. Empty Nuts Barack. He just looking at you like, "Yeah, you know what I've "been up to. "Flying and fucking. Ain't that right, Michelle?" Slaps her on the ass. For real. He just has that swag about him. And I miss his cool, you know? Politics aside, I just miss his cool. Like, even the way he would introduce his family. "Uh, now listen. "I'd like to recognize my family. "My wife Michelle, our daughters Sasha and Malia. Michelle, Sasha, Malia." Right? He always says it that way. Like, they're some kind of law firm or something. You know, my baby, she just got an internship at Michelle, Sasha, & Malia. Mm-hmm, graduated top of her class. SpelHouse. [laughter] "Michelle, Sasha, and Malia." In that order. He always says it in that order like they're some kind of singing group. "I'd like to recognize my family, "Earth, Wind & Fire. "My daughters, Frankie Beverly & Maze. My nephews, Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike." [laughter] Dude is cool, man. I hate that we don't see him as much. I wanna see him out here. I wanna-- I wanna see him on TMZ. Baller alert. Shade room, you know? I want him out here. I want Barack to have a cool job like--like a night club DJ. Could you imagine that? You in the club just chilling with the homies. All the sudden you just hear, "Single ladies, I can't hear you." [laughter] "Healthy ladies, make noise. "Turn down for what. "If you got a $100 bill, get Obamacare. "Single ladies, I can't hear you. "Healthy ladies, make noise. "Where my birthdays at? I see you, nigga. Oh, shit." [laughter] "Uh, cut--cut the music. "Uh, I just met a young lady, uh, by the bathroom. "Uh, baby said, uh... Uh, baby said, uh, 'DJ Barack, can we turn up?'" [laughter] "And I told her as I once told you, "Yes, we can. It's lit. "Oh, oh. What y'all wanna hear? "I said what y'all wanna hear? "When I say Michelle, you say Sasha and Malia. Michelle." all: Sasha and Malia. "Oh, oh." [laughter] I enjoy, uh, you know, telling my story up here. You know, introducing y'all to the real James Davis. I'll be honest. I'm from South Central. But I play golf. I love golf. It's really fun being a black golfer 'cause it's, uh-- I don't know. How do you say it? Unexpected? Uh, are there any golfers in here tonight? Yeah? You play golf, sir? Okay, non-white golfer. I see you. I get on that first tee. It's usually me and, like, three super old, super rich white dudes, and they are looking at me judging. They're like, "Oh, what is this? Make-A-Wish? What are we doing?" [laughter] "What is this, diversity day? "Is it--Is it-- Is it a holiday? "Are they doing a theme? "They should have put it in the email for the tee time "that they were doing something special. "The minorities. Go ahead, Radio. "Hit the ball. Uh... Cliff. What do you wanna do?" But here's the thing. I play golf. I'm amazing, so the look they give when I hit that tee shot, priceless. It's like we're back in slavery, and they're like-- [gasps] "You can read?" [laughter] [mimics explosion] "Who taught you how to do that? That is illegal. "You get killed for stuff like that. Cliff, look at this. Look at this." [laughter] But listen, after that moment, the wall comes down and the bonding begins. They go from not telling me where they live to inviting me to live with them. They're like, "Have you seen 'Blind Side?' I wanna do that to you." [laughter] "I'm your Sandra Bullock. "I wanna move you into the garage. "Get you better clubs. "You just stay away from my wife, "and we can make this happen. We'll get you on that tour." [laughter] I used to, like, follow Tiger Woods heavy. I used to study his golf swing in slow motion over and over again. I called it dedication. My friends called it super gay. But, uh... [laughter] [laughs] You know, they just didn't get my passion. I actually met Tiger Woods-- [clears throat] Yeah. "Oh!" [laughter] Yes, I actually met Tiger Woods. "Oh, you did? Is he still looking how he looked?" [laughter] I saw him this summer, and I told him to his face, "Hey, man, you're one of my heroes. "I believe in you. I think you still can do this. But I saw that DUI video." [laughter] "Tiger, you looked buff as fuck, bro. "Like, man, only you can turn a DUI video "into a Nike commercial. I literally--I literally bought everything you had on." Nike, let me get the DUI Dry Fit. The one from the-- from the video with Tiger. The one he had on that make you look swole. I need that. In his size. Without the cop. [laughter] Tiger Woods was a huge deal to the black community. I remember watching him win tournaments with my family. You know? Like, he was a shot of self-esteem to the culture. And people don't talk about that. But Tiger meant a lot. Every Sunday he'd win one of those major championships. It was like a baby O.J. verdict. You know? It was a black man winning in an arena you weren't used to seeing him win in. You know? Augusta National was his justice system. [laughter] And he overcame it. That joke is kind of like the O.J. verdict. [laughter] Some people like it. White women don't. But, you know. Tickles me, sir. [laughter] I wanted to be on tour, but I didn't wanna be Tiger Woods. I wanted to be more like the Allen Iverson of the PGA Tour. You know what I'm saying? Good at golf in the confines of what golf was. But still doing hood shit on the side. Just 'cause. Just 'cause it's me. It's me. I wanna be me. I wanna rap and play golf. You know? Like, that's what I wanted to do. The Allen Iverson of the PGA Tour. I'ma be--I got my slacks and my polo and my hat with the endorsements all over me. But it's not gonna be NetJets or some insurance company or a watch company on my wrist. It's gonna be a company like Hennessy. Swisher Sweet on my pocket. [laughter] My golf bag is just gonna be some huge advertisement for my uncle's barbecue sauce company. Will's Sauces. [chuckles] Ten-for-five combo. For sale in the parking lot. All--All on my bag. With a message from my mama. "You gonna do good today, baby." Like, it's just, like, a little Post-it on the bag. Don't touch that! My mama gave me that Post-it. [laughter] 'Cause here's the thing. People think golf is boring. It's actually not. Back in the day, there was this golfer that-- You can-- [blows raspberry] all you want. But that's because you haven't heard of a golfer named Chi-Chi Rodriguez, okay? This dude, he makes a put, picks his putter up, starts sword-fighting nobody. Who wants it, air people? Ghosts? Who wants it? You see that on TV and you're like, "Damn, he's on cocaine." The best--That's the type of fun they're having on tour. You can't-- [blows raspberry] that, huh? You can-- [sniffs] that but you don't-- [blows raspberry] that, okay? I know about fun. And that guy's having some. You be at your job, send an email, and just pick up your keyboard and be like, "What? Who wants it? "Email, out. Sent. I'm out this bitch." [laughter] Don't let me get on tour. I'm killing it. I'm gonna have a cool nickname too. Like Barbecue Davis, you know? Like, it's already on the bag. I might as well just take it further. They have weird nicknames like Tiger Woods. Beef Johnston. These are real people. Fuzzy Zoeller. They have weird names. Barbecue Davis, I'd fit in. I hit a good shot. Boom! [mimics licking sounds] [laughter] Too much sauce. Yeah. Put that in the Styrofoam. That's leftovers, baby. 300 yards down the middle. Is you hungry yet? Barbecue Davis. [laughter] I'm--I'm acting a fool out there. I'm doing all the new dances. I make the put, I'm Milly Rocking. What you want? [cheering] I'm Nae Naeing. He ready. [cheering] I'm Moonwalking, just doing the Moonwalk on the green. With spikes just destroying the grass. Just literally destroying the golf course with dance moves. So that the next group has to show up like, "I--I can't putt through this. "I don't--Who allowed this? It's destroyed. "USGA official, come over here. It's fucking destroyed. Who did this?" "I'm sorry. It was Barbecue Davis. "He... came here about two groups earlier. "Made a 7-footer for double bogey and kind of went crazy. He always acts up on those Trump courses." [cheering] Where the single ladies at? Where the single ladies at? Make some noise. [cheering] Okay. Loud, but not a lot. No silence. What's up? I heard about 15 enthusiastic single people. But a lot of couples here. It's cool. Just celebrated by two month broke up-aversary. I don't know if you guys celebrate the broke up-aversary. Don't aww. It's like your anniversary. But the opposite. You celebrate your emancipation from the asshole. Like, me, I treat it like Independence Day. I take off work. I barbecue her old belongings. [laughing, cheering] I do fireworks in the backyard. This was me the other day, just-- [mimics hissing fireworks] Bitch. [laughter] I hate you. [laughter] She keyed my car. Right? Who's still doing that? Who's still--Who's still keying cars? I thought that went out of style. That's throwback petty. [laughter] People ain't keying cars no more. Nobody just like, "He say who? He say what to me?" Like, nobody's keying cars no more. That's--That's old school. That's throwback petty. She was probably wearing a tie dye shirt and some overalls. Listening to '90s R&B on her Walkman, just angry. Just... ♪ This is how we do it ♪ [laughter] Going in just... ♪ Once upon a time in '94 ♪ [laughter] Just doing "Fruit Ninja" all up on my car. [mimics slicing] Apples, oranges. [laughter] And here's what sucks. My car was parked in a public setting. You know what that tells me? Someone saw her keying my whip. And they allowed it. They were just walking to their car like, "Huh? Get it, girl. "Get up in there. "Here, use my keys. They're heavier. "I can--No, you ain't doing it right. "You gotta see the paint chips falling off. "Get in there, girl. You're not doing it. "Let me sub in. Sub in. "Can I sub? Can I sub? "Can I sub? Get in there. "He deserve it. I don't even know the nigga. He deserve it." [laughter] 'Cause y'all ladies come together for #metoo and #fuckhim. [laughter] What I did, though? Nothing. Not a damn thing. [laughter] No, I didn't--Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, I didn't... 'Cause I'm a respectful person, I'm showing you right now. I didn't deserve it, you know? I didn't deserve it. Brothers who say ma'am don't deserve... [laughter] ...to have their car keyed. Ma'am. Praise God for you. [cheering] That's all I'm saying. I didn't deserve it. Good niggas get keyed too. I'm starting a foundation, 'cause there's other brothers out there going through the same thing as I am. You know? And we don't deserve it. We don't deserve our property keyed. You know? It's an epidemic. It is. Wait a minute. A good nigga just got keyed right now somewhere-- somewhere in America. A good brother is getting his Prius fucked up. [laughter] And it's bad. We don't deserve it. I didn't deserve it. But you know what? I'm petty too. So I didn't fix my car. I'm driving around LA right now. 2005 keyed-up Honda Accord. Keyed up. I'm keyed up. Keyed up. Keyed up. Somebody write that song. Send it to me. [laughter] It's a message to the future ladies in my life. You see my car. It's keyed. What does that tell you? [blows raspberry] At least I'm not boring. [laughter] Well, come ride this roller coaster. Come find out why I got keyed. You know? I'm a challenge. Do you accept? [laughter] I'm serious. Ladies, if you're tired of these respectful, text-you-back-immediately, flower-sending, FaceTiming-ass dudes, come to death row. [cheers and applause] These dudes all in the videos. Dancing. [laughter] Where were we? [laughter] I'm having a good year, y'all. I'm really excited, man. You know what I'm saying? No kids. No fumbles this season. I ain't dropped no seeds. You know? I've been giving these eggs the Heisman. You know what I'm saying? Just juking responsibility. Get out of here. Circle, circle. L2, L2. [laughter] Get--Oh, almost. [laughter] And it's tough, 'cause this safe sex business requires-- [exhales deeply] Uh, responsibility. Maturity. They don't tell--They don't tell you that in high school when they're putting the condom on the banana. They don't. They're like, "Hey, this is safe sex. But that unsafe sex, ooh." They don't tell you that. You gotta experience that euphoria on your own. [laughter] And then after that-- [scoffs] It's a crossroads. [laughter] From that point on, every time you have sex, you gotta make a decision. Am I gonna have it the safe way or the right way? [laughter] The way God intended? Ain't nothing about ultra-thin in the good book. That's all I'm saying. Ain't--Ain't nothing about-- [laughter] All I'm saying is it's tough, man, because sex with a condom is like... [groans] [laughter] It's like eating a Starburst with some of the wrapper on it. [laughter] Like... it's cool. It's all right. But if that wrapper wasn't on it, though? You gonna leave me hanging, though? You know? Thank you, man. Security. Fucking security. Wow. Wow. [laughter] Hey, camera. Hey, camera. There's the asshole right there. Yeah, there it is. There. Camera, there it is. Zoom in on him. Make sure you get him. Make sure you get him. Make sure you get him. Hey, hey. What's up? It's James' special. It's your boy James. I'm just a cool dude trying to tell my jokes, and sometimes I look--I like to give the audience, like, a high five or whatnot. But sometimes they be like, "No." And I think that's messed up. But you know what? It's my hour and, uh, just peep an asshole right here. This is an asshole. This is what he looks like Uh, we'll be back after these commercial breaks. [laughter] Oh, man. [applause] No, we gotta talk about deep stuff too, you know? Let's--there's a lot of things going on in the world right now and I'm here to talk about them. You know, like for example, this #metoo, #timesup moment. I think that's very dope. Let's make some noise for that. [cheers and applause] Yeah. And I'm glad that messed-up people doing messed-up stuff are being held accountable. You can't just abuse your power and do messed-up stuff and think that life just goes on. No. That's some real-life accountability, and that's social progress. And I'm proud of us as a nation for embracing this movement. Now, if that accountability could make its way into a police department, that'd be dope too. But, no, hey, ha, ha. I digress. I digress like a motherfucker. But at the end of the day, the movement's dope, and it's been very educational. Especially for men. 'Cause I'll be honest, 99% of the cases I hear, I'm like, "Wow, that's crazy. That's ridiculous." Like, "That dude is out of control." But there's been a couple cases where I was like, "Ooh, didn't know you couldn't do that." [laughter] All right, we--now we got a hard answer on that one. Mm-hmm. No more gray area. That is now a no, okay? Can't just pull it out, sir. [laughter] You know, and I learned my lesson. You know, 'cause I'll be honest, I come from a different time. Uh... Back in my day, that's how you avoided the friend zone. You know? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I like you. Dick out. Like... [laughter] It's out 'cause I like you. I have feelings for you. So that's why this is happening. [laughter] If I had a friend and they came back from a date and they said they pulled their dick out, I'd be like, [gasps] You like her. Like, this is serious. You should ask her to the formal. [laughter] But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. We just have to own up to the fact that men and women look at the act of pulling one's penis out differently. For women, when a guy pulls out their junk, they're like, "Whoa, crazy. "Whoa, crazy. Why are you doing that? "I don't know if I should run away, if I should stay. Is the dick a weapon?" You know what I'm saying? "Am I a hostage now? What should I do?" But guys, we don't think of it like that way. Like, we're not on some malicious shit. When we pull our dick out, it's like... offering gum, you know? [laughter] It's like, look, I'm not crazy. I know people like this. There's people out there who like this. I happen to have some on me. [laughter] Want some dick? You want some? If you don't, no big deal. I'll put it back in this little pocket. It's not a big deal. I'll keep it to myself. [laughter] But who would I be if you were in the mood for dick, I had some dick on me, and I didn't offer? I was raised better than that. I'm being considerate. [laughter] What is funny to me is, uh, the fact that we never hear the lies that these alleged, uh, you know, sexual predators tell when they're finally confronted with these allegations or the truth of what they did. We only hear the statement. I'm sorry, I did some messed-up stuff. I'm gonna take some lessons, and my bad. You know? I'm gonna take some lessons on how to be a good dude. You know, I signed up for classes and, uh, I'm gonna work on it. That's all we hear, but we never hear that, like, first lie they tried to tell to get out of it. 'Cause men, we lie. We don't--When we're in that corner, we're not like, "You got me. I have cheated." [laughs] We're like, "No, shoot. What--Man, I was-- "We was playing ball and then, you know what I'm saying? The taxi driver came through and pulled my dick out." No. [laughter] We make things up. Like, you know one of these officers was like, "Sir, an actress has come forward and said that you masturbated in front of her." And he was like-- [gasps] "Wow." [laughter] "So that's how she's spinning it? "That's crazy. "You can't trust nobody these days, officer. "That's--That's what she-- "Whoo. "Ooh, she playing with my life, officer. "She playing with my career. "I don't play like--I don't even play like that, officer. "I don't even play like that. "I ain't even that dude. "No, that's--No, I grew up single-parent mom. "Like, no. She, like raised me-- "Single-parent mom. Like, she, like-- "I would never do nothing like that. "Officer thi--this is what happened. "All right? "We was at a festival, right? "And there was a after-party, right? "And we was all dancing outside. "And now I got these stiff pair of jeans on, you know? "The kind that, like, crease even though "you ain't ironed them, you know what I'm saying? "Just, like, really-- "And the fly sometimes comes down on 'em. "Whatever. "So, anyway, we dancing, right? "We doing the electric slide. You know. "And we had got to the part where you--you know-- "you swing it, you know what I'm saying? "Like, when you swing it to get to this part "of the choreography. And so when I swung it, my dick popped out." [laughter] "Now, of course, I'm embarrassed. "My dick's out. You know, I ain't big. "I ain't small. I'm in the middle. I don't want it out like that, you know what I mean?" [laughter] "So what do I do? Shove it back in. "In the process, it felt good, and I came. But... if she gonna sit up here and say..." [laughter] "That I jacked off in front of her, "that's a lie, okay? "Did I come? Yes. "'Cause of her? Absolutely not. "It was an electrical slide malfunction. "Are we not men, officer? "Has it not happened to us before? "Right? "What you mean, I'm still arrested? "That don't make no goddamn sense. "I demand to see a real nigga in this precinct. "Somebody who can dance. "Who can understand what I went through. "You gonna put-- You gonna book me? "You gonna book me? Over electrical sliding?" [laughter] "That's crazy, man. "Where the-- Where the sergeant at? Where Ice-T? Somebody." This, uh--This is not the body that I wanted for my special. I'll be honest. I wanted to look like right-now Chappelle. I look like old-school Chappelle. [laughter] Chappelle before he had time to go to Africa and do arms. [laughs] Chappelle looks like he went to Africa and was like, "Who's the best biceps trainer? "I'm done with comedy. I just wanna do arms, nigga. "Just sock out network. What? "I wish they would give me notes, nigga. You see these arms?" [laughter] Who leaves a show and just goes, "Arms, nigga, that's what we on now. That's my new shit." [laughter] I really just wanna be casually cut. With disrespectful shoulders. [laughter] Shoulder titties, you know? Just... two chocolate shoulder pads. I want girls to be like, "Damn, he got some big old shoulders," like... "Look at his shoulders. Ooh. I just walk through a crowd. Knock somebody over. Oh, I apologize. I knocked over your baby, ma'am. I apologize. Here. Here your baby go. All right. I underestimated my width. You know what I'm saying? I didn't know the results were gonna hit me so fast. #Gains. I'm in there. [laughter] Drinking the Muscle Milk. Does it leave me gassy? Sometimes, but you know. Sacrifice. Just farted right now. [laughter] But it's back here. You good. Y'all good, y'all good. It's back here. It's back here. It's back here. [laughter] You smell it? Oh, okay. Uh... You know what no one talks about when working out, is nutrition. For real, everybody wants to work out, hit the push-ups. But no one's talking about what we eat. Everybody wants to be woke. Nobody wants to be food woke. Right? Like, yes, police are killing niggas. But... [laughter] What about your food? [laughter] Have you seen the documentaries? "What the Health." "Fat, Sick and Dead." Or, whatever it's called. [laughter] I've only seen one. It was enough. I'm afraid. Pretty much here's the breaking news. If it tastes good, it's killing you. [laughter] Every time you go, "Mmm, mmm, mmm," that's the sound of you dying a little bit. [laughter] You were gonna be 85. Now you 82. Every "mmm" was a year off your life. And this meat, this meat has been compromised. They don't tell you that. This meat is all bad. 85% of all meat has fecal matter in it. You know what that is, sir? Boo-boo. Caca, doo-doo, diarrhea. In your meat. In your steak. In your chicken wings. In your Lunchable. Boo-boo. Luncha-Boo-Boo. [laughter] But we don't know and we not tripping because the presentation on fleek. It looks good. But in reality, this meat is like Magic Johnson. Sure, it looks rich and healthy on the outside. But on the inside are some things that you don't want inside of you. [laughter] Mmm. Killed 'em. [laughter] That's some writing right there, sir. I'm sorry. Is it still too soon? Are we still not allowed? When can we get the green light as comedians to talk about this dude? 'Cause let's be honest. [laughs] His HIV is old enough to legally buy alcohol. Like he's--he's had it for a minute. That needs to be the new Netflix documentary. "What the Fuck is Going On with Magic?" Would you not sit down for a "Making a Murderer's" amount of time to get the answers? All I'm saying is if he has a cheat code, he gotta share, okay? That or take a--a live blood test on "Maury." Something. We need to know why his HIV is steroids-like. You know? He's just getting stronger and buying teams. [laughter] I'll be honest, y'all. This is my black-spiracy. I don't think he got it. [laughter] Magic doesn't have HIV. He's just a paid spokesman. The--The good people at HIV, they approached him-- Look at him. Look at him. [mimics explosion sounds] That's crazy. Yo, my dude. Slow it down. Take it back. You trying to tell me... No, no, no. You try-- [exhales loudly] Bro. Shit kinda make sense, though. [laughter] I think the good people at HIV approached him at the end of his career. [laughter] When the assists weren't coming as fast and Michael Jordan was coming up. He was coming down, and they--they said, "Listen, hey. Listen. "Magic. We got an HIV problem, okay? "People are afraid of HIV. "But who do they love? Magic. We're prepared to give you $25 billion." [laughs] "The keys to Starbucks." [laughter] "And the Dodgers and the Lakers. Take them both. You just gotta wear this badge forever." And he took it. Now, listen. Maybe I'm wrong. But it does make sense. All I'm saying is don't be surprised if LeBron James at the end of his career announces that he has ebola. [laughter] Hey, y'all. Is this on? Hey, I'm--Hey, I'm LeBron, and I'd like to announce my retirement from the NBA due to my fact that I have contracted ebola. I don't wanna get into the details. Me and my family, we ask for your prayers. Luckily, little Zhuri, she's safe. She didn't get the ebola. Just me. [laughter] The point is, you got to be food woke. [laughter] That's the point I'm making here, people. You got to be food woke. Now, listen. I'm not a vegan. I'm not a vegetarian. I'm not a veterinarian. I'm just... food woke. I know what's good, you know? I was vegan for, like, two months. And it was good. I felt amazing. Like, I don't even know how to brag about how good I felt. But I will say that my, uh... going to the bathroom game was incredible. Like, when I'm not vegan, it's bad. I sit down there and it's like me and Jesus. Heavenly Father, get it up out. Get it up out my stomach. The Satan, it's stuck. The Devil is in my stomach. Get it out, Lord Jesus. If you could just move it up out my system. What sin must I stop doing tomorrow for you to take the pain out of my stomach right now, Lord? I'll do it all. I'll stop cussing. I'll stop lying. I'll put down the weed. Whatever it takes, take the pain. I'll be sounding like Tyrese. What more do you want from me? Heavenly Father, this has been my whole lunch break. [laughter] Get me out of here. Just holding onto the walls and whatnot. Oh, oh, goodness. I'm having a baby. [laughter] When I was vegan, in and out. Just like-- [grunts] Didn't even have time to get on Instagram. You know? That fast. Boo-boo in and out, like, "Damn, boo-boo. "We used to hang out. We used to talk. "We used to kick it for a little bit. You got places to go?" I'm food woke, though. So, yeah, you know. Some people do cocaine on the weekends. I have bacon. We're both like, "Fuck it." You know what I'm saying? Like, it's Coachella. We're living life. [laughter] But I know what's good. Y'all gotta be food woke, man. For real. But, at the end of the day... I appreciate seeing so many diverse people here, man. This is a very positive image right now. Hope the cameras catch all these different races and people of different backgrounds chilling here. Enjoying comedy. 'Cause we haven't seen that right now. In the media, they wanna show us divided. They wanna show division. That's what's hot right now. You know? They wanna show these Charlottesville White Lives Matter rallies and whatnot. And it's like, we ain't all tripping like that. First of all, that Charlottesville business was crazy. That, like--That is just, like, a bunch of angry people. It looked like all the angry people from the YouTube comments took it offline and said, "Let's go to Charlottesville." [laughter] Like, that's crazy, man. I don't even understand the-- the ideology behind White Lives Matter. Like, they do. Like, y'all survive scary movies. Like, there's--it was two white quarterbacks versus each other in the last Super Bowl. They matter. Statistically, y'all winning. Relax. You're still ahead. If anything, it should-- it shouldn't be so tense. Those rallies should be happy. It should be like a championship parade. Just a bunch of white people yelling, "Scoreboard!" Like... [laughter] But all this tiki torch business, why? Why all the anger? [laughter] Like, honestly, tiki torches? For real? Like, if the power ain't out, or you ain't in a cave... you don't need no tiki torch. Unless literally you're on an island at an airport greeting people as they get off a plane. Doing this. [laughter] That's the only time tiki torches should be allowed, is if you're doing this. If you're holding a tiki torch and you're just standing still, you're racist. You're a racist piece of shit. [laughter] But if you're doing this, I'm gonna be like, "My nigga. "What's up? "All right, is this what we doing? "Is this the new shit? "That's a cool dude. "What's your name, little twisty dude? "What's your name? "That's a cool dude right there, man. You going to the club after this?" Squiggle, squiggle, squiggle. [laughter] I will say this, though. I did enjoy the fact that Charlottesville and these White Lives Matter rallies, they show an alternate image of angry protesters. Because they like to put this whole rioting narrative on the black community. Like that's our thing. And, like, rioting is not a black thing. Resilience is a black thing. Overcoming the odds is a black thing. Fried chicken, barbecuing, do-rags, that's black shit. But riots, that's not our thing, okay? That's not--It's--And it's not like we wanna do it. 'Cause I don't like in the news when they're talking about these cases and these verdicts that are about to come out that are always like, "The verdict will be read "at 4:00 p.m. We'd advise you to stay inside. "Board up your windows. Evacuate the city, if you can." Like it's some kind of hurricane warning. It's like, rioting is not plan A. It's plan C. Plan A is telling America, "Hey. Uh, there's some messed up stuff going on." And we hope they hear it. Plan B is showing footage of the messed up stuff we have been talking about and we hope that's digested. But if plan A don't work and plan B don't work... [groans] [laughter] We gonna have to burn something. [laughter] But just know we not chilling watching the TV like, "Ooh, "let it be guilty. "No, dawg. Take off your Jordans. It might go down." Like, no. That's not the case, man. We're not chilling at the family barbecue like, "Hey, dawg, you know what we ain't done in a while?" "What, Marquese?" "Nigga, riot. "You married. He in college. I'm juggling these mixtapes." [laughter] "We just don't have time to get out there like we used to. "Remember back in the day? "We used to just burn it down. Are we old now? Is this what 30 feels like?" [laughter] Now, I--I'm not a rioter, or one who riots. Too much smoke. I got asthma, you know? It gets in between me and my message. I can't even get the full slogan out, you know? So what I like to do is, uh, let the rioters do their thing and then when they go to sleep, then I hit the streets, go to racist people's cars, and take off their current registration sticker. [laughter] Yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna fuck up your property. I'm gonna fuck up your day. I'm gonna send you to the DMV. 'Cause black lives matter. And then I'm gonna key your shit. [laughter] 'Cause I be mad, but I don't wanna, like, be a riot person, but I do wanna strike back. I don't know. I just wanna be, like, a petty rioter. Like, next time somebody does some messed-up stuff, shoots some unarmed black dude, I'm gonna be mad, but I'm not gonna burn the city down. I'm just find the house of that cop and break in and take their best wine. [laughter] And throw it in the freezer. You know? I'm gonna just mess up their next celebration. Grab the wine, honey. [screams] [laughter] There's our anniversary out the window. I'm just, I'm in the bushes like, "Nigga." [laughter] It's hard out here, man. It is. And I have a lot of friends. I have a lot of friends. They like using the phrase, "Fuck the police." And I get it. I had a uncle who was killed by a police officer. No joke. Real talk. Albert Williams, my dad's brother. Killed by a police officer. That's an uncle I never got to meet. That's a lifetime of birthday, Christmas, and graduation presents I never received. Because of the cops. He could have been the rich uncle. Or, like, the pimp uncle. You know the little pimp uncles? Who just say the wrong thing at the wrong time? Come at you at Thanksgiving. Hey, young blood, when you're going down on a girl... if you can't breathe, you're doing it right. [laughter] Just remember that. I'm nine. I don't know what you're talking about. What? Uncle Albert's so crazy. He told me to hold my breath. I don't--Mom, Uncle Albert's being crazy. I don't--He told me when I go down-- I don't know. I don't know. [laughter] Mom be like, "Albert, get your ass over here." "What? What? "The nigga gonna do it at some point. "The nigga gonna do it at some point, right? "You gotta prepare the nigga. Each one teach one. "Come on, now. You gonna get on me?" [laughter] So I get it. Fuck the police. At least the police who were involved in killing my uncle. Fuck them. Wherever they at. I hope they trip and skin their knee. Right now. Just--Just right now. I hope they in life just like, "Oh, God damn it." [grunts] "Shit. "What the hell? What the hell? "How that--How'd that happen? "Baby, I done skinned my knee. "I did--I was--I was asleep. "I was asleep. "I fell out the bed and skinned my knee. "It felt cosmical. It felt spiritual. "I feel so guilty right now. "Don't--You know what? "Don't even put the first aid on it. I'm gonna just take the pain." [laughter] My point is I get it. I understand the phrase, "Fuck the police. But here's what I tell my homies. When you're getting pulled over, you can't have "fuck the police" energy. You can't. You gotta put it away. You gotta act. You gotta put that in your pocket. Put it in your sock next to the weed. Something. You gotta get it out of there. You gotta get it out of there. Like, me, when I get pulled over, I'm respectful. But sometimes that's not enough. You still might get shot up. So now I'm taking it further. I'm doing like you ladies. Next time I--Next time I get pulled over, I'm flirting aggressively. [laughter] I'm hitting on the cops. I'm touching their face. [laughter] This is me getting pulled over. [mimics emergency siren] Excuse me, Officer Handsome. Was I swerving? Maybe I was lost in those blue-ass eyes of yours. Officer Channing Tatum. Okay. Look at the facial structure. Look at the facial structure. Blue eyes matter. I see you. Okay. Quick question. Is this bulletproof vest or bulletproof chest? Okay. I see you. CrossFit, you signed up. Hey, little body camera. I see you seeing me seeing you seeing me. Looking like a snack. Okay, officer, with your tig-old shoulders. All right. I see you. Got your dents all out, looking all wide. You hear what I'm saying? Hella wide. [laughter] Look here, officer. I don't know what I did, but I'm gonna fight it so I can see you again. [laughter] Now, listen, this-- this is just theory. I've never tried it out. [laughter] But I feel like it's gonna go one of two ways. Either the officer is gonna be, uh, straight or homophobic, in which case he'll be weirded out. Hey, stop staring at my dick like that. Uh, get out of here with a warning. Just stop speeding. Please. Or he's gonna be gay and... we gotta see where it goes. [laughter] We gotta--We gotta date this dude for a couple weeks. You know? [laughter] Yeah, yeah. Now--Now you got a main chick and a side cop. [laughter] You over here telling your homeboys, "Yeah, listen, I would play ball with y'all, "but I--I gotta go hang with Officer Harrison. We're about to Netflix and chill and watch "Bad Boys." [laughter] Now I gotta really fuck the police. [laughter] Y'all come to the after-party. [laughs] Like, let's go somewhere. Let's do something, huh? Let's go to the club and pool all our money together. [laughter] And win. And just win somewhere. Just ball out. Like... [laughter] Four bottles, 100 people. [laughter] Just winning. 'Cause that's the thing. I be--I be wanting to go out. But, like, I don't have the money to win the way I wanna win. I promise you, three straight birthdays, I went to the club with my closest friends. We put our money together. And we would pop a bottle. [laughter] Now, the phrase is popping bottles. Not bottle. You ain't never heard a rapper-- ♪ We in the club popping bottle ♪ [laughter] ♪ We in the club with one bottle ♪ ♪ Just one, moderation ♪ Like... ♪ You spending money, no, no, no ♪ ♪ We saving money ♪ [laughter] ♪ One bottle, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Ten niggas ♪ Like, that ain't a song. No one's in the studio making that. 'Cause it's too much pressure. 'Cause once that bottle runs out, they will usher you back to where? Regular P. The regular section. Where no one cares about you. So now you have to check your homeboy. You might have to get disrespectful. Contrel. That's a lot of gulps, brother. What did we talk about in the car? Sip, song, song, sip. Song, song, sip. Why you deviating from the game plan? 'Cause you tipsy? Grow up. Someone get Contrel out of here. Barack's DJing. We can't even have fun. He's saying, "Yes, we can." And, nigga, we can't. I'm James Davis. That's my time. I appreciate y'all. [cheers and applause] [hip-hop music] ♪ ♪ It's lit.
