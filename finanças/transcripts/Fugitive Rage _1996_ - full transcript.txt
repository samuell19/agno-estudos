We are moments away from the long awaited verdict in the murder trial of Labor Leader, Tommy Stompanato, who the media has labeled the Gucci Goombah for his dapper style of dress. Straw polls give better than three to one odds in favor of his being found guilty of ordering the murder of his former live-in girlfriend, actress/model Rhonda McCormick. I'm being told that the jury is back in the courtroom. We'll bring you the live footage now. All rise. Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Hamilton presiding. Be seated. We better... Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. So as not to prolong an already lengthy case, have the people reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Let the record show that the verdicts have been signed and properly formatted. How say you? In the matter of the people versus Thomas Francis Stompanato, on the charge of conspiring to murder Rhonda Diane McCormick, we the people find the defendant, not guilty. Oh my goodness, no. That's insanity. What, how could that be? You son of a bitch. Oh, better luck next time, kid. So say one, so say you all? Oh, my God. I can't believe it, this is incredible. Yeah, I told ya that was a piece of cake. Hey. Congratulations, Tommy. You always were lucky. Drop the gun. The gun, lady. [James O'Keefe) Hello. Yeah, I just reviewed the tape you sent. No, she's perfect. I'll handle it from here. Miss McCormick, I'm James O'Keefe. Excuse me if I don't shake. You're excused. Have a seat, I don't bite. I might. Guard. That won't be necessary. That'll be all please. Let's see, McCormick, Tara V. For Victoria, very pretty. Five years as an LAPD street cop. Second into SWAT. First female to be team element leader, that's very impressive. Joined DEA in 1993 and terminated after the shooting of a Columbian drug informant, who just happened to be a child molester. You've been reading my diary? Oh no, not me. Let's see, you've got a 15 year stint here to pull for the attempted murder of Tommy Stompanato. Now just between you and me, I think it's a shame that the man survived. Who the hell are you? You don't sound like FBI. Oh, just a overworked, underpaid civil servant, at your service. If you really are a damn spook, why don't you tell me why Stompanato killed my sister? You don't know either? No. Just that he did it. What, your secret decoder ring couldn't figure it out? That's very funny. No, it didn't. Look, I'll cut to the bone. You finish what you started with Stompanato, and we wipe the slate clean. Give you a full pardon and relocate you to any spot on the map you wanna go. And I bet if I'm killed or caught, I'm on my own, right? Naturally. The problem with you spooks is that you're never around when the lights come on. Forget it. Okay, have it your way, Miss McCormick. But if I were you, I'd be more concerned with what goes on around here when the lights go off. I'm sure I'll be seeing you again. Help him out. Now get your hands off me. Whataya think, I'm a cripple, or something? Well, what are you waiting for? Go on, get the bags. Good to be home, huh? It'll work. I think gotta take a little time off before we go back to business. Alright Ryker, let's you and me talk. Ah, I thought we outta wait for a more appropriate time. Ah, no, right now. Well, I thought maybe you'd wanna get settled in before we got back to business. I know what you thought. Wendy, come here. Come here. Ah, look at that face. That's a young lady you're looking at. It means she knows when to keep her eyes and her ears and her mouth shut, right? Tommy, are you crazy? No women knows how to keep their mouth shut, for chrissake. Yeah, but you can learn a lot from a face like that, can't you Frank? Alright, let's talk. - Excuse me, Mr. Stompanato? - What? You're supposed to take your medication the moment you get home. Alright, half an hour, huh. Do you want me to put the bags away now? No, why don't you stand there for a week. Take the bags. It's time for you to strip, McCormick. I said, strip. I say dance, you better dance me an Irish gig. Are we clear on that? This is my favorite part. Now let's see, on the east side, Ramirez delivered a 20% increase in the sale of drugs and weapons. On the south side, Poole showed a 25% profit over and above the usual in prostitution, and 20% on drugs and 15 on guns. Chung, on the west side, stayed pretty much the same. What am I gonna do with this chink? That's what you get for dealing with foreigners. Yeah, well, I tell you what, why don't you send a couple boys over there and explain things to him, alright? I think he'll get the picture. Yeah, I'll have Big Apple and Skinny Louie rework the menu. And as you're aware, today's the first day of Tara McCormick's term in the pen. Hmm, our eyes and ears ready? Just waiting for orders. Ah, I've been dreaming about this since the day I was shot. You know what I'm gonna do to that lady? I'm gonna gouge her eyes out, and I'm gonna tear her arms out of the socket, and I'm gonna tie her tits in a granny knot. And then I'm gonna get mad. I'm gonna strip her clothes off, and I'm gonna make her crawl a mile through broken glass just to kiss my ass, to beg me to kill her. I think that about covers everything. Remember what the doctor said, you shouldn't get upset. I just remembered, you got one week to bust a cap in her ass, capiche? Yeah? Tommy. Yeah. It's time for your massage. Yeah. Well boys, let the lady do her handy work. What do you say, get out of here. Oh, Frank. One week. Capiche. Ready? As I'll ever be. Ah, now, now, careful, you know, I'm still kinda hurt. Private nurses, You gotta love'em. (inmates mumble Hey ladies. Girl, you go girl. Hey, baby. Hey, girl. I brought you girls a new chew toy. Sure hope you make friends easy. Hey, I know you. I saw you on TV. McCormick, right? Yeah. I'm Josie. That's Spider. That's my bunk. That's my bunk, too. Then you must have a very big ass. Smart mouth bitch. Hit her. Yeah. Get her. Now, that's your bunk. What the hell is this? You haven't been in here five minutes. Just making new friends, chief. Who started it? She did. Can it, I'm talking to Williams. Just like she said, boss. Uh-huh, alright. You only get one hot shot and this one's it. Go get her. Come on sister, let's get you looked after. What hit me? Is this okay? Hey, Terminator, you put'em where you want. Thanks for helping me out with Broom-Hilda. No problem. That was some pretty nasty stuff. Was it like judo? A little of this, a little of that. So did you like take a class, or something? My dad was in the service. He taught me a few things. Cool. So will you teach me some of it? Yeah. Sharrisse, you're looking good. Mr. Ryker. Gotten any letters from home lately? Sure, mom's in the hospital, another stroke. She's paralyzed down the left side. Ah damn, that's rough. Who's paying the bills? Government mainly. She's probably gonna have to sell the house to pay the rest of'em off. What about your little girls? Staying with Aunt Ruth. She's not so good with kids, you know? Yeah, neither am I. I'll look in on'em. Make sure they get food on the table and clothes on their back, okay? You don't have to do that. Yeah, I do. You came in here instead of turning state's evidence against us. We never forget a favor. Consider it done. Thanks. You didn't come all the way out here to talk about my family. Get right to point, huh? What's new in your neighborhood? Ah, the shooter bitch. You want her to have a little visit from the welcome wagon? Okay. My pleasure. Thanks, I'll give the kids a kiss for ya. You girls having a good time playing with yourselves? Not as much fun as you'll be having later with Mr. Billy Club, I'll bet. Lights out in three minutes, wise ass. You wanna stop? Nah, let's finish this hand, I feel lucky. Lock it up. - Goodnight. - Shut up. What are you in for? You hurt somebody? Yeah, kinda. I killed a guy. My husband. You? This one night he came home drunk. Just like every other night that week. He had knocked me around a couple of times the night before. But this night he took off his belt. No. There was blood everywhere. Mine. Got me across the head a couple times with the buckle. And then he started to rip my clothes off. He didn't even care that they were all bloody. Before I knew it, we were in the bedroom. He started to take his pants off, and I reached over and grabbed his .357. He looked at me like I was pointing a butter knife at him. Then he called me a stupid bitch. So I shot his dick off. You don't mess around, do you? Hey, when I said until death to us part, I meant his part. That's lights out. Okay. Hey, gin. I think I've been hustled. Night, Tara. Night, Jessie. Thanks for listening. Lot a girls don't like to hear some parts of the story. No problem, kiddo. Night. Night. Hear that? Those birds are really creeping me out. I don't know why the boss keeps them. Yeah, me neither. Jesus. Dammit Tommy, those things are gonna kill ya. Yeah, yeah, so talk to me. We handled the little bitch in prison. Good, good. We wouldn't want anybody out there thinking they could put a bullet in me and get away with it. Be bad for business. Although the papers, they loved it. Alright, I got off the phone with Amele. He wants that shipment of stingers a week early. So make sure you get'em all gift wrapped real pretty, huh? Tommy, Jesus, we can't make, you know, the delivery that soon. I mean we barely got rid of the Army trucks we hijacked them off of, look at that. You think I fell off of one of those trucks myself, Ryker? I mean get this shit outta here. Well, the reason we're doing this is because he's paying us $75 grand for the rush shipment. See time is money, and he respects that. Dammit, I don't know, Tommy. He seems to be in too much of a rush, you know what I mean? Well, why don't you take a couple of boys, bring a few undeclared favors to the party. You see anything that even looks like a badge, you put a rocket in his pocket. Smart bomb, huh? Uh-huh. Now, get outta here. Before I start liking ya. Yeah. Hey, fight. Oh, yeah, woo! Yeah, get her. Everybody, fight. Come on, blondie. See what you're made, huh? You like that, huh? You like that? Come on, bitch. Come on, bitch. Are you okay? Yeah, are you? Yeah, I'll be fine. Either one of you moves, you both get shot. Control, Russell here. We need emergency med team Block D, Cell 106, staff. Is this the way your people watch over us? Nobody on my team is on the take. So shut up. Then how do you explain this. Stuff a cork in it, girlie. Not here even a day and you damn near kill the most popular girls on the cellblock. I guess we better get you measured for a rubber sack while we still got a chance. Let's go. Five minutes, McCormick. And you're damn lucky to get that much. Are you here for a reason or just to play cute? I don't know, maybe both. Um, I'm here to offer you that same deal that you walked out of before. Deal. Well, that was a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be. I want the same deal for cellmate, Josie Williams. Full pardon and relocation for both of us. I'm sorry, I'm not authorized to make that kind of deal. Then find somebody who is. Otherwise it's not going down. Okay, I think I can work it out. Meanwhile, I want you to go back to your cell, get yourself ready to travel, and be discreet, and I'll get the necessary paperwork to get this ah, Josie Williams, put into a protected cell until you get the job done. And I'm just supposed to trust you? Of course, I work for government, why wouldn't you? Look, go back to your cell, get your suitcases packed. Okay? You my dear, just had the shortest sentence on record. McCormick, I'll see you on the outside. Yo, O'Keefe here. I gotta status report on McCormick. Yeah, well, we got her. Oh yeah. No, well, there's just one little glitch. She demanded the same deal for her cellmate, a Josie Williams, and I okayed it. Hey, there didn't seem to be any other way to get her. Yeah, look we need her a whole lot more than she needs us and she knows it. By the way, that con you nearly killed last night is gonna live, not that you care. Nice call. I need to talk to you. What's going on? In a little while, you're going to get moved out of here. My guess is they'll stick you in solitary. Solitary? Shh, keep it down. Look, a guy came to talk to me. It's the second time since my conviction. He offered me a full pardon if I agreed to help him. What, like testify against somebody or something? Yeah, something like that. They're gonna move you to a safe, protected cell. After I've done my part, you come out a free woman. You did that for me? Why? Let's just say you remind me of someone. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Just act cool when the time comes, keep quiet. You got it. So who was this guy with anyways, the government or something? Yeah, your tax dollars hard at work. Be careful, Tara. Yeah. Farino, where the hell's Tommy? He's upstairs. You wanna be back on the east side runnin' numbers? Let's get it together. Alan, get the hell outta here. What's with him? Ah, he's got a bug up his ass. See you later. It is going to be a... What? Ryker. What you want? I need to talk to you. Oh, What, now? No, next week. Of course now. How am supposed to get any work done around here? Alright, alright, come on, come on, come on in. Nap time, why don't you got take one, and I'll only talk to this man for a little bit, alright? This better be good. According to our information, McCormick was transferred out of Diablo around noon today. Where'd she go? Nobody knows. They were moving her to Terminal Island, but the bus never arrived. I wanted that broad whacked, didn't I tell you that? Huh? And you were supposed to take care of her, Ryker. What am I supposed to do, get up, go out and get a gun and get the broad myself, huh? Look, take it easy, Tommy. Okay, my people told me that, uh, she had her friend, here name was, ah, Williams, got moved to solitary right after McCormick got on the bus. She's under heavy guard. I'm getting the picture. Yeah, Feds, I think they made a deal with her, and I think McCormick's little bitch was part of it. What's the bottom line here, Ryker? Don't worry, whatever they're cooking up, McCormick won't be too quick to cooperate if we've got her little bedmate, and the guard's on our payroll. Do it. But meanwhile, you find that broad, you understand? We know every flea-bitten safe house they got in this town. So you get her, you break her in half and you bring me the pieces. Which pieces you want, Tommy? The top or the bottom. Do it! I'll need some of the boys. Fine. Take as many as you want. Oh, and Ryker, don't upset me again. I'm not a well man. I know it's not the Ritz, but it is the most secure and discreet safe house on the West Coast. I can hardly wait. Uh, this is it. What a palace. Miss Prince, you are looking delectable. Can it, O'Keefe. Ladies first. Alright. Okay. My turn. Ooh, careful there. May I? Of course you may. Ouch. Was that as good for you as it was for me? Ah, better for you. You know, a lot of people tell me that. Anyways see, under the house, well we have a workout room, a sparring setup, and a fully soundproof small arms range. Yeah, sure. No really, we do. Alright, let's get you all set up here, okay? Come on, time is our enemy. It doesn't look like much. Farino, you schmuck, it's a damn company safe house. Underneath that Betty Crocker exterior, you can expect to find three inch armor plate, Armalite bullet proof glass, not to mention enough gun ports to give you a good look at that linguine you had for lunch. Hey, DeLuca, don't touch me there. Hey, sorry man, I won't do it again. So, what do we do now? Well, we got people watching all the safe houses. But she might not even be in there, this could be a waste of time. Well, I guess we'll have to wait. See what you got. You know, McCormick, Helen Keller could have seen that one coming. Feel better? No. Come on. Now I'm happy. Okay, playtime is over. Do it again. O'Keefe, time for your briefing. Time to go, thanks, Chief. Okay, this is Tommy Stompanato's California mansion. He maintains two other residences here in the United States, there's one in Miami Beach, Florida, and one in Aspen, Colorado, but this is his primary residence Our intelligence places him here as of yesterday evening, so we know he's still there. Now, he lives in a private, gated community which has it's own private security force. You are under no circumstance to harm anyone within that patrol group, it that understood? I'm not in grade school, O'Keefe. I used to do this for a living, remember? I'm just covering all my bases. May I continue? The perimeter around his house is controlled by a three-man, roving team, alright? Now they have eight hour shifts so that gives us approximately 10 men on site at any one given time. Wow, that's a lot. Now once you're inside that perimeter, you're gonna encounter electronic security measures, ah, such as pressure pads, motion sensors, and electronic I-beams. Now you're gonna wanna find a control box, - so you can reroute... - I'm gonna need to reroute circuits to computer pathways to disable them. Since they're probably on a dual fail safe, meaning they're triggered by an interruption of their power source, I'll need to take a small battery along and hard-wire it in prior to the rerouting process. Very good. Thank you. I knew you were the right person for the job. I just didn't realize how right. What kind of weapons do you have? Oh, we got the usual assortment of rifles, pistols, shot guns, submachine guns, whatever you want. Okay, this looks feasible. Why don't you get me a pencil and paper. For what? I'm gonna make you a shopping list. Hey, Steve, you got a light? So how's it going? Ah, it's real quiet tonight. You know, real quiet. You heard anything yet? No, nothing yet. If I don't hear from them in a couple of hours, I'm gonna check it out personally. Stay awake. Ryker. I trust you have good news for me. Yeah, Tommy, I wanted to bring you up to speed on a couple of things. That armed shipment for, um... Amele. Amele, yeah, it's ready. All we gotta do is wait for confirmation, that he's transferred the money into our Cayman Island account. Alright. Tara McCormick. No sign of her yet, but I got the boys working on it. Shit. Alright, $20 grand to the guy who nails her. I'll pass the word. That is unless, I get a hold of her first. In that case, well, I'm gonna take my own... sweet time about it. Sweet time. I understand you're bringing me a house tonight, huh? I believe I am, Tommy. Now, I'm gonna take care of it personally. Ah, you be sure and wake me, alright? Cause I don't wanna miss this one. Quarter Master is pretty impressed with your shopping list. Gotta bring the right tools for the job, ask any plumber. That's not bad. Lousy, my grouping sucks. If you get hungry, we got some Chinese food coming a little bit later. This is a government safe house and all you can afford is takeout? Can you say the word, budget? Can you say the words, stir crazy? Come on, let me out, just once. No can do, McCormick. The agency would have my ass. Come on, O'Keefe. Between county jail, the pen, and this damn place, I'm going nuts. Just one night. No way, not without an escort. Well then escort me. What if Stompanato's men see us? I'm sure if we stay away from Italian restaurants, we'll be fine. Okay, but we have to smuggle you out. Okay, let's go, I'm starved. Trunk time. Does she have to go with us? Of course she does, she's our driver. What, do we need a chaperone? It's one of the rules. Field agents always have backup. Oh, I feel much safer. Hey, you've never seen Miss Prince in action. Alrighty, watch your head. There ya go. Comfy? Yeah. I'm going to send you guys my dry cleaning bill. Does she ever shut up? I don't think so. Hey, look at that. That her? No, it's just a couple of badges. Well, maybe we should follow them. Hey, maybe we should just do what the boss said. Just lay low and wait 'til she comes out. What do you say, goombah? Damn girlfriend, you can't even win if you cheat. What's up? You scream and you're dead. You understand? Now we're gonna walk out of here nice and easy like. If you do anything to attract attention, I'm gonna put you on death row permanently. Now we're gonna be a nice, little bitch, aren't we? The van's waiting outside. That's good, are you girls ready? Yeah, you got our money. No. It's a jailbreak darling. Those stupid prison guards, they always get killed. So where the hell are you taking me, you bastard? This is what I call the good news, bad news part of the game. The good news is you're out of the joint. The bad news is you're with me. Life's a bitch, ain't it bitch. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Go on, I don't wanna hear it Let me show you how it's done, okay Chief? Go on. Here ya go. Thanks. So how long have you been with the company? Since just before the Berlin Wall came down. Were you there when it happened? No, I missed the big party. I was damn near permanently late. What happened? Well, my team was sent in to extract this Czechoslovakian nuclear scientist, and in the middle of the operation, the bean counters back in Washington decided to pull the plug on the whole thing. So we had to body slam our way back to the border. Yeah, out of a team of 12 men, only two of us survived. Just my C.O. and myself. My dad experience a similar situation in Panama. Yeah, who's your dad? He was the C.O. of Seal Team Seven. McCormick, now your dad wasn't ole Blackjack McCormick, was he? Did you know him? Well, only by reputation. Hell, he was one of the original Peck's bad boys. That's him. Our administration had been using Noriega's resources to fight the communists. After the general had outlived his usefulness, my dad took in a Seal Team Seven to bring him in one way or the other. Nobody's quite sure what happened, but they weren't as lucky as you. They all got wiped out. Pay up. That's gotta sting, Bubba. You're next. Good, I can use the money. Well, getting a little late here, we should get outta here. Okay. That was good, huh? Bitch cost me $20 bucks in my pool game. I think $40 outta cover it. It'll take a whole lot more than $40 to cover you there, junior. Hey, cash machine's this way. Didn't anybody ever teach you people proper table manners? McCormick, O'Keefe, outside. Now don't anybody move. This guy spilled my beer. Alright, show's over. Who wants another drink? It's midnight, all is clear. Just wish my shift was over, I'm getting tired. Hello, pretty face. Bite me. You know, a lady shouldn't spit. I know you. Everybody knows me. Big question is are you gonna tell me what I wanna know? Well, what do you wanna know, dirt bag? Must be tough to get a good education when you grew up in prison, huh? Go to hell, you stupid guinea. Look, I know that you and this Tara chick made a deal with somebody and I wanna know who it was. Tommy, Tommy. No, no, honey, it's alright, it's alright, just come on, come on in. Oh, like hell I am. Ryker. Now you see? That can happen to you just like that. Now I wanna know, what is this bitch Tara planning? Okay, I'll tell you. Good. She said she's gonna hunt you down and stick a red hot poker up your ass, you sick bastard. See that wasn't so hard, was it? Gentlemen, I think I, ah, feel a song coming on. This is fun. I'm telling you man, that stuff's gonna twist up your veins tighter than a nun's BVD's. Hey, lay off, wise ass. I'm just trying to help you. Well, if you wanna help then shut up. I've been up all night, I gotta eat. Well hurry up and eat then, I wanna get some sleep. Now we got something in common. She might not even be in there. If I whacked Tommy Stompanato, I'd get a six change and move to Bolivia. Well, you're already pretty weird. Jesus, Mary, mother of God, would you look at that? No way. Let's get her, man. There she is, man, let's get her. There's one dead chick. Hey, hey. Dammit. Swerve the girl off, man. Ah, shit. She's getting away. What the? I can't believe you, McCormick. What the hell is wrong with you? Are you deliberately trying to get yourself killed? Do you have any idea who those guys were? Yeah, my guess would be Stompanato's men. I thought we were in the most secure safe house in California. Yeah, well you know sometimes there's a few rats in the in the ole cheese cupboard. Well, I'm not staying here. Now don't worry, you won't have to. So what's next? What's next is plan B. Plan B? And what's plan B? Plan B is what comes after plan A. Now go upstairs and get your gear together so we can get the hell out of here. Go. Okay, McCormick, here it is. You jump ship one more time, and I'm gonna send your ass right back to prison, okay? Fine, but I think it's time you told me why the company wants Stompanato's head in a trophy case so badly. Fair enough. Seems that lately, Stompanato's gotten himself into international arms dealing, especially with Syria. The mob is pretty patriotic. Hm-hm. Well, Stompanato's breaking traditions left and right. It seems some of his fellow capos have decided to put a little hit out on him. Be nice if they could take the heat for this little party of ours. Be a minute. Yeah, it's O'Keefe. Yeah, I know. No, two of Stompanato's men made the safe house. Yeah. What? Oh, when? Ah, son, why am I always the last to know? No, no, you take care of it. Yeah, now. Great. Who was that? It's my prison contact. Your cellmate, she got snaked out of her cell last night. Two guards got killed. Josie? Yeah. You can bet Stompanato caught wind of your disappearance, put two and two together and figured out we were behind it. Goddamn it, I hate it when innocent people get involved. I should scrub this goddamn mission right now. I just wish there was some other way to handle it. I'm going after her. Alright. We'll get some rest, and we'll hit'em at daybreak. What's this we crap? I'm your back up. Oh, this is getting better all the time. What, I'm not in grade school there McCormick. Remember, I do this for a living. Wise ass. You better take first sleep. If I don't take a shower soon, the trash collector will be after me. Good idea. Mind if I join you? I thought you were supposed to be sleeping? Well, you know, there's still water conservation in this state. Turn around. O'Keefe. O'Keefe. O'Keefe. O'Keefe! Get your clothes on, let's get the hell out of here. O'Keefe, you really know how to show a girl a good time. What's in the bag? Toys for Tots. Why don't you take a look, see what Santa brought ya. Pretty cool stuff, huh? Yeah, it'll do. Yeah, I got everything on your shopping list, plus I threw in a few extra goodies. I didn't know you had a tattoo. Ouch. Now we got more trouble, Tommy. What is it now? She wasted DeLuca and Big Apple. Did you verify this? I checked it personally. It's that damn broad. I sent the rest of the boys over to the safe house they were watching. It was deserted. What the hell is she up to? My guess is the Feds are gonna keep her moving around until she can turn state's evidence. Nah, nah, nah, not another trial. You've walked on three raps. Even if we don't find her and she ends up turning evidence, our lawyers can beat this case hands down. No, no, no, no, no, the law of averages is against me now. I don't follow. You ever read, Frank? See this book right here? All the great criminal minds of history are right in that book. And every one of them has two things in common, they were the best in their field. Yeah. And they all got caught. It's not gonna happen to me, Frank, you understand? My pictures not gonna be in this book. Cause you're gonna find her. If you have to turn over every rock in this town, and kill every blonde that crawls out, you are going to find this broad, do you understand me? No bitch has ever beaten us yet, Tommy. This one just takes a little more time. Time. Well, time is at a premium. Bobby, you still around back? Yeah, what-a-ya need? Can you come up and relieve me? I gotta get some coffee. You got it. Hey Kenny, you still on the radio? Yep. You've got five minutes left on your shift, then head back inside. Okay, could use some sleep. Man, will you pipe down with that greaseball shit? This is America, speak something I can understand. I said, I gave that chick such a smack to the head she didn't feel anything, she didn't flinch. Excuse me. Is Tommy home? I'll take that as a yes. Congratulations, kid. You made the grade. Shut up. Where's Josie? Josie? Josie. Oh yeah, Josie. Well, that's for me to know and you to find out. I intend to find out. Alright, I'll tell you what, I'll make ya a deal. You let me live, and I will take you to the girl, and you can both walk outta here. Now what ya say? Fine, take me to Josie. Ah, deal? Deal. Help me up, will ya? Jesus, you did a hell of job on me, kid. I can't, I can't make it. Here, give me your hand. Get up, you piece of shit. Ah. Up bitch. That's right. Uh, uh, uh. Get'em up. Nice and high. You know, you always said that I was lucky. And as much as I would like to just stick around and kill you slowly, I gotta go. So, do you have any last words, bitch? Only two. Die, motherfucker. Tara, Tara in here. Oh my God. Hold on. There, I'm so sorry, this never would have happened if it wasn't for me. Hey, at least I'm out of solitary. Tara, look out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's me. Don't point that thing at me. Did you get all the bad guys? Yeah, I think I got everybody. Missed one. Surprise, surprise. All clear, come on up. Oh, you're a nasty lady, McCormick. Too bad you're on the wrong side. What the hell, O'Keefe. They make you a better offer at the last minute? O'Keefe and I are on the same team. Remember that story I told you about Berlin? About my C.O. and I were the only ones to escape? Well, I'd like you to meet Captain Frank Ryker. My friend, mentor, and all around partner in crime. Thanks for the assist. You play a good game, girl but you're too trusting. All of it, everything, a set up? Afraid so. Well, there were a couple of glitches. Like you slippin' out of the safe house and the motel last night. Oh, by the way, thanks for saving my ass on that, but all in all, went off without a hitch. It's funny, how you tried to save her life but only ended up getting her killed. But what the hell, you'll both die together. Why go to so much trouble? Tommy Stompanato, a peacock trapped in his own zoo. He put his brains on hold and tried to rule his kingdom the wrong way. Now it's my turn. Hey, Frank, out of all the coup d'etats that we've arranged with the company, this had to be the easiest, huh? Just like knocking over dominoes. Keep a stiff upper lip, little soldier. Who knows, you two might meet again, in heaven. Okay, both of ya, turn around. Come on, turn around. It was a lot of fun, McCormick. Eeny, meeny, miny, Williams. If he moves, kill him. Well, Williams, Hey, I know we can work something out. You moved. Soldier. You know, McCormick, you should have walked away when you had a chance. Get married, have some kids, spend a little time in the kitchen. Why don't you stick your head up your ass. Now that had to hurt. You don't pass out on me, we're not done. If you kill me, it will be murder. Finally, something we agree on. You alright? Nothing that a case of bourbon and a year in intensive care wouldn't cure. Can we go now? Who's gonna stop us? Hello, is Mr. Stompanato home? Yeah, he's in the house. Who are you? I'm his trial lawyer. I don't think you'll be able to get him off this time. What now? You ever see Thelma and Louise?
