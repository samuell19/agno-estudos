Life is not like you live it but as you told it. The Football World Championship. Holy time, where everything can happen. The whole world seems paralyzed while the fate of somebody... of everybody... in one way or another, depends on one ball. Finish the wait. Thirty days where one risks everything. Lose the track of time. Face your worst enemy, your own team, you people. Your destination depends on a decision. One false move, a look into the void, and it is the end. You hope. Analyze your options. Play with the time, with the nerves of your opponent, and then... in the right moment... After all, living in Mexico is risking the life every day. Sometimes you win and tell your history. Sometimes not. DAYS OF GRACE It will be the starting of World Football Korea-Japan 2002 It starts the match between selections from France... Get out. I said, get out! Come in, bastard. Come in. Take off your clothes. Strip, bastard, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Strip all, the panties too. Let's go, bastards! My boss also abused me.

Tell your cousin that next time if he does not care for his child, I'll smash his face. Why do you always try to be tough and I have to hear the hard calls of the boss, bastard? -Because I scare more. -Scare? With only met you, you scares me. Also, am I who has the look of a feline. Feline? Do not talk to me about felines, bastard. The Black Lions of Senegal won France . What I say you, is that God is against me... Yes? Shit! I'm coming, sweetheart. I'll. Be calm.

Look down! -Any problem? -Do not worry... It's just for tonight. A boy... -Want to enter to see him? -Can I? #My daddy and my mummy want to sell me...# #For chile and tomato that they want to eat# I'll never forsake you, Emiliano. We are going down a staircase. It is very humid. It is a basement. This is a basement. The first match of the night, during the 2006 World Cup in Germany... How many are they? How many are they? Get up. -I have to remember everything. -Head up, motherfucker. I can not stand. Tighten it well, it is for him not to see us. It is almost fainting. Hold. How many are they? How many are they?

I bet top in this match, these bastards will ruin me. I'm talking about your godson and you don't worry. Yes, I'm listening. Don't want to see the football? -I'm messing up? -See Football! When I met Esperanza, I asked what was her team. She told me that not liked football. But whenever America's team lost, she kept silent. She told me that her whole family was of America, but her. When she became pregnant, I discovered among her things a little sweater of the America. I know it, mate. That's why you should be the godfather. -To what she do not influence him. -Do not worry, buddy, I'll save your child's life. Do not worry. "All units..." Do not answer. Not our area. 0-1-18. What is 10 of 23? We should not be here! Come on. It's a 23, let's go. Wait to end the match. Let the damn match, let's go. -Another time? -Put it in my account. It is a 12.

That will see, you bastard! Will have to see! Will have to see, you bastard! Son of a bitch. Where are you going, bastard? Son of a bitch. My head... Where am I? This is a basement. A chain. I'm chained. Is a chain. What's this? -I need to survive. -Good morning, young man. I will explain some things quickly because I do not like spend saliva. Move your head if you understand? Very well. -Who is this guy? -Do you want a cigarette? Yes, please. How is he? There was a man that I saw, when they caught me. A man dressed in black, yes. First, you should know we are professional. -Who is this guy? Will he? -We know what we do, Do not try to mess with us, bastard! The hood, never take off. Your life depends on it. Your freedom, worth two million dollars. Dollars? You're wrong. I do not have that money! Do not play smart. My contact was working for you. We know that is very rich. What contact? -We know that has a company. -Who are you? We know that his brother is a shareholder of a large company. We know all about you, your family, your children. Know when his wife is menstruating. So to hell with me. My family, no... -My family... -Like I was saying, we are professional. How are you, bastard? Within 20 minutes, you will make your last call. Think well whom you want to talk. Take it easy... Hello? It is urgent! Hello? It's nothing. An ointment and already fixed. It hurts! You're hurting me. Be careful, bastard! This World Cup of Korea-Japan 2002 Germany faces Saudi Arabia... Esparza! -Captain. -What happened? We received the 32 that there was a 23 in that area. There were three 25 in 12. And this one? Shoot at us, and we fight back. We have one 28, one 15 and one 53. That big idiot already arranged a vacation. How come so quickly? We were in a tacos kiosk, not far from here. It is the only place where you can see the World Cup matches. I need the report. Explains everything as it should be. What happened and the times. Yes, captain. I'll see if I can get you an award, Esparza. Who is? And to think that at this time you would be in your big home drinking your Chivas and fucking your blonde. Pig. She's delicious. If I was you, I fuck her nightly. Care, don't put my wife at this history. Shut up. Don't tease him. I speak what I want! You here are nothing! You are a shit! Get it? Get it? I got you. It is rather, you rich of shit! Give me your fucking ring, you bastard. What did I see? what was that, a tattoo? A tattoo... yes. Our Lady of Guadalupe. I could see, I could see. They pay me to hold criminals. Why tried you to stop an fucking assault, Lupe! -It's my job! -No. Now your job is to be a father! I do not want anything happen to you, Lupe. Why do not go to my mother's house? In San Mateo, can be get another job. Being a cop keeps me in line. Do not be angry, dear. I will sing for you. #I will bless your name, my dear #I'll be the man #to shout from the rooftops "I love you" #I'll give you roses, beautiful, #I'll confess, lovely #if you kiss me I lose my mind #you crazy, crazy, crazy me, The most important question is to know... what kind of kidnappers are we dealing with. This will take some time. Should continue with their lives as if there was nothing. That your daughter continue going to school, and you, Susana, continue going to your studio. Also say that Mr. Lozano is on holiday, without giving details. Let's take some security measures. The first is freeze all bank accounts. -Why? -Please Susana, lets that this man do his job. It's so how it is done in Mexico. -Do you need anything else? -No, Max. Thank you. Excuse. Know their employees well? Maxedonia works with us since 15 years of age. Lady, I'm here to help her. Sorry, but we will investigate all employees. What a bunch of idiots. A flinty entry from Pauleta -What kick! -This Voice... is a boy. Come on. Came the other. -What are you doing? -I was watching the match! The match? I do not care! He is the violent. You'd be aware, Do you see? Help me to undress him. Come on! Why? -Get up, bastard! Come on. -Don't hurt me! Get up. Get up! Shut up! What's going on? -Take off your clothes. -Why? -Take it off. -Why? If you try anything, I kill you. You stink to shit. Could raise the bed, please? Slowly, it hurts a lot. Thank you very much. I told you not to go, but you like to play the Zapata! We should arrest them, so that they can't cause havoc. -You saw how they killed Edgar? -I do not want to know these bastards! I need you to do me a favor. Get a beige envelope. It's necessary that was delivered at the address I will give you, is very important. It should be tonight. Anyone ought to see you, do not be late. What's inside? I do not know nor want to know. I obey the orders, other case it will fall upon me. What's up? Nothing. Only obey the orders. But if I do not deliver, they will kill someone. The key of my closet. -Congratulations, Esparza. -Thank you, mate. Bastard! Think that if it was dangerous, I asked to deliver? Take my car. And can fill the tank. Comes again this bastard. Don't tease him. -Hello. -It's you? Want a sandwich? That voice... is the boy. So I can not eat. Thank you. Wanna take a toke? To calm down. No. Talk to him. That's why you're in on it? By the drug? Shut up! Understood, bastard? Get it? I got it. Bastard. I've seen this guy on television. Damn, Melquiadez. Do not mess with these, bastard! Where's the fat? He had an accident, I came in his place. Let the envelope on the floor and turn around. Calm. Relax. We're the same team. Here is your commission. Maxedonia, you tell your friends when their bosses going on holiday or when they buy a new car? No, sir. I am very discreet. Discrete? But... typically, people speak about the work. With whom do you live? With my brother, Doroteo. Since when are you living with your brother? Since the death of my mother. What makes Doroteo? He is the "sparring" of a boxer. A boxer? And what is the name of the boxer? Actually, I do not know. He left. Two days ago he was traveling. Was travel... Your brother has criminal history? -No, sir. -Already over? Do not. And the baby's father? -What? -Yeah. How is called the father? Maxi, are not accusing you of anything. We just want to help find Arturo. Has no father. Who have been? Who have been? Why me? Why me? I can not stand it. Look at you! Looks beautiful. A true hero! They even mentioned his name. It's a pity not being in the newspaper. Nobody wants to see the picture of a fat cop like me. It was my grandmother who gave me this. She says that during the revolution, that Zapata himself killed a guy who tried to rape her mother. This bullet came out from his gun. I do not know if it is true, but always liked this story and justice in it. It was a dark time. People had to make everything to impose justice. What have I given? I do not know. Who gave you? Left in my closet. So, my friend, I am. The order came from above. I do not know who sent it. I do not know what was inside. I do not know who the recipient was. I don't worry to achieve your goal. If a bandit attack to earn some money is with you. If I find doing something worse, you will regret. Do not play the fool. Will screw us. Do not want to know what was in the envelope? Do not tell me you opened? Buddy, it was a big mistake. Do not mess it. Otherwise, it will end badly for us. Managed to make me nervous. It's top of the line, here is not. The number of who is calling appears. If was his wife, does not answer. It even has games. Here are not. Know who is calling you, before answering. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Where is your vest? -I'm sorry. -Proceda. Understood. Asshole! Are here. -Yes, captain. -Esparza! Wait for me, I'm with you. Congratulations, Lupe. How does it feel? Well, Captain. Knew the bandits who took already had criminal records. A bank robbery and a armored car. -How long ago? -Less than one year ago. And they were already out? You already know how this fucking country works. The bastards end always out. We can do nothing as it should be. So I need you. See? They are everywhere. They are not afraid of us. They sell drugs two steps of the battalion. Corruption. Theft. Drug. Black market. Until smugglers. Ask us... to do everything according to the rules. Fuck the rules, Esparza! Those fucking bastards will pay for what they do. We have to tighten the siege on those who control everything. If we catch a big fish, we say it in public. These are days of grace. At the Cup, criminals fall custody and the police also. This, Lupe, is an opportunity. What is legal not always is fair. And vice versa. The people are with you if you win. Here the rules are not meant to nothing. Are good for the referees. This is the error that many officers commit. They think we're referees. We are players and we have to win whatever the cost. As the Maradona's "Hand of God". This is not called "soccer" called "Football Soccer Federation". It's a team effort. Accept? Excellent! You're a team player. Tomorrow night, we settle some scores. I will give the details. You can trust me, Esparza. Tomorrow we will score a fucking goal! A good reminder of June 22, 1986, at the Mexico World Cup, where Diego Armando Maradona... used the famous "Hand of God"... -Hello? -Hello, sorry, here is the Maxi. Can you tell me where is my brother? -Long time that I have not seen. -Do not know where Doro is? He told me he was traveling with one of his boxers He did not tell you the boxer's name? It is not serious. Goal of Mexico! The ball is at the bottom of the goal! Mexico is winning France in South Africa! How will be my father? Your father is a smart man. He must have found a way that nothing happens to him. Are you sure will nothing happen to him? It's coming. It's coming, bastard. Calm down, boy! Stop it! Shut up, bastard. Stop! Want to play? Want to play? Germany 2006! Mexico vs. Portugal. Wait, I'll let you go. Started the match! Figo passes to Maniche , but arrives Cartridge... He's playing. Is playing soccer. He likes soccer. He likes to play. Sure. It's a boy. Lying on the floor! Hands up! Let no one move! Facing the wall! Hands over the head! Legs part away! Legs part away! Lying on the ground! Lying on the ground! Don't move, bastards! Very well. Very well. Let's close up the little shop. Where is the little Madrina? -Where is the Madrina? -You don't hear? You do not speak Spanish? This place is under protection. We pay our taxes. Ask your superiors. It is the Lord that they are speaking, captain. Arrest them now! What, bastard? Is yours! He's skilled with the ball. You know, I once saw Hugo S?nchez. My brother-in-law introduced me. He does not drink, but that day, we finished a bottle of tequila. Liked me, because he told me something what few people know. What? He never wanted to be soccer player. Get a cigarette? Hugo had some problems. Nothing serious. But was in a bad phase. There was a coach who insisted for he played for his team. But what caught the attention of Hugo was the daughter of the coach, Rosita Quintana. He told me that even remembered that day. That was very hot. Like here. He did not want to play. But Rosita came to see the match, and thought: "If I score a goal," "Also score with her." His team was losing by two to zero. But thanks to him, they won six to three. That year his team won the championship. And two years later, Hugo was playing in the first division. However, Rosita fell in love with another player. Fucking women... Currently, Hugo is the Mexican best known in the world. Can you do me a favor? Which one? Tell me about the Mexican team The next match is against Portugal? Why do you want to know that? You're a dead man. Shit rich. How are you, detective? You cheer up? Come on, Lupe. I am all yours. -I'll make you a special price. -Where? Come. You almost convinced him. Well can you say it, he is difficult to convince. Maybe one day, get catch me. Room 12. He is waiting. Esparza, thanks for coming. We could not talk about it in the battalion. You are brave. You have courage, you will help me clean up the fucking Police and this whole fucking city. I have information about it. I know who kidnapped the artist. One thing at a time. Our last intervention was hard on those bastards. But you know what they said. There's a rat in the police. We have to hold this bitch Madrina. She is linked to the kidnappings. But the main thing is the drug. That's how we pick it up. Hear what I say, Esparza, otherwise your family is in danger. Betrayal is in the air. Watch her territory in the beef market and keep me informed. You're already one of my "Dorados" Esparza. Let's be clear. I'm who decide, and soon also control your money. Madam, we can negotiate with these people. These people? I do not want know anything from them. I want to know why not mortgaged his house to pay. It isn't that simple. The Arturo bank account is empty -and we do not know why. -Who knows if he suspected something. -Ask her to their employees. -Camila, don't interrupt, please. Let him do his job. Make your work as brother and arranges this money. Why don't sell your home? Still angry about the affair Blanco? -Susana, Calm down, please. -Do not tell me to calm down! Ms. Susana... We are doing everything possible to find those responsible. They do not want to be found, they want money! Takes this bastard. Son of a bitch... Where is my product? Which product? Do not know what you're talking about? But if you missed something, the best is going to Police to complain. It is very funny, Esparza. I'll kill you, motherfucker! I'll kill you, motherfucker! Will learn. Tell your colleagues that pay my taxes. My territory is under protection. Rob me is a declaration of war. And when I say war, I mean the apocalypse. -Understand? -Not me you should say. Not fuck me, Esparza. Listen... Listen carefully. The fury of hell is nothing compared the fury of a criminal who was betrayed. It's done. We pass for the last sixteen. Good. Do you know much about soccer? Do you like other sports? I like boxing. Boxing... It is tackle someone like you. It takes courage. Are you brave? Yeah. The other day, one big challenged me. I accepted. Even scared, I accepted to fight. -He saw me less... -Come here! Come here, shit! I have the impression that is not at the height of it. This bastard is not our friend, is not of our family. It is not even a person. You should see him as a thing, as a table. You do not speak with the tables, is not it? Or yes? Do not. Doroteo? Where are you, guy? In Tijuana, with Rafa. How's Doroteo Jr? How in Tijuana? Had not gone south? No. His baby will be the next Julio Cesar Chavez. I have to ask you something. -Will... -I have to go. -I'll call you back. -Promise? -Yes. -Have care. OK You know what, bastard? The bitch of your wife and the bastard of your son want to catch all your money! It's always the same thing. When it comes to money, love disappears. It's a lot of money. Must be with problems to join it. I can not pay in installments? Installments? Want to pay in installments? We'll show you how paid in installments. Come on. Increases the sound. -Come here. -No. Do not... -Come here. Quiet, bastard. -No, no... How are you, Max? When do we dance? Don'be clown. Susana, we must have calm. We don't know if it is his finger. Get the money immediately, bastard! Arturo will not die because of your cowardice! -I'm doing... -Stop lying and pay! It's not how it is done in Mexico? Tell me who gave you the envelope and where can I find it. Otherwise, godfather or not, I'll kill you. I have only one name. Rulo. I give what I can find in my cabinet, follow the instructions. I never open the envelopes. I swear it. If what you say is true. I'll catch that rat. It's impossible. They are powerful and well informed. They threatened to kill my brother, who works in the Ministry Justice. They are powerful. Powerful or not, they will pay. Who is Rulo? I do not know him, but I know that sells articles of contraband. In Tepito, within the fortress. He has a great shop of pirated DVD. That's all I know. If you're lying, I'll shoot you in your head. -Do not be mad. -Shut up! A policeman. Disappear. -I'm arrested, Mr. policeman? -Rulo? -Depends. -Was Melquiadez who sent me. I got it. Gives it to the fat, Say him it is not out yet. He'll know what I mean. Can you breathe? It is for pain. "Died my friend Bronco..." # he went to see what was in the Furthermore # # He always was the horse bolder # "His elbows become broken..." I know nothing! I'm just a middleman! "It's getting warm. Changes the package. " He's a dead man. Those who are searching will kick your ass. It's too much for you. They will catch you, bastard. You're already dead. Says nothing? You know what? Will loosen the tongue, motherfucker. Or I'll cut it like in the movies, but without special effects. Captain Jose, over. Here Lupe Esparza. Captain Jose, over. Central, here Lupe Esparza. Need to talk to Captain Jose, over. Negative, captain Jose is in an operative. So my general it is only a cat to catch another. Central.

Rafa Marquez is playing like shit. Stop saying nonsense. -You still believe... -Shut up, Bastard! -Damm argentinians. -How much do you bet? It's none of your business! Korea-Japan 2002, the selection... Live in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup... Son of a bitch! -Who will it be? -Go to open! Come on, will open! Give me the gun. Give the gun. Increases the sound. Against the wall, motherfucker. A minute and a half to start the match. How many are they? Are many! My mom! We're fried! Police! Lying on the floor! What do we do? Kill him! Drop the gun! Hands up! Good afternoon. Is your mother home? Hands up! Turn around! Please! Help me! Is over, we rescued you. We'll take you to your family. You're safe. I am Inspector Esparza, from "Los Dorados" special group. Can you walk? You can lean on me. Let's get out of here. Come on. Just hold her neighbor and want to know if you know something. You knew what she was doing? Do not. Begins to pray. If they come, I'll kill you. My mother left. I'm watching the match. You can ask the neighbor 144B. Thank you. Slowly against the wall!

Leave a message after the tone. Hello Doro, it's me again. I need you to call me back. Kidnapped Mr. Lozano. Take care of yourself. Had mounted a deathtrap, when entered you was an easy target . -Besides these bastards were... -Esparza! -Captain. -Come. -Are you okey? -Yes, captain, thanks. News? I talked to a guy who gave me the address. I tried to contact you by radio, but they said he was in an operation. Could not wait. Who gave you the information? A bastard called Rulo. He gave 32 of 60. Your wife will be very proud of you. This bastard of Rulo, is arrested by the Federal Police. He is the link between drugs and kidnappings. I made him talk, Captain. I can do it again. Let me go back there, he'll talk again. I'll see what I can do. Mexico will be eliminated in the last sixteen... What a garbage of selection! I'm already bored! Why are you happy? You bet on the game! Yes, I bet for the other. You must be crazy to bet for Mexico. Traitor! An electric shock to agree on the selection? Calm, my boy. Calm. Save your strengths for Rulo. Let's make a toast. To my "Dorados"! I'm going to the bathroom. There leave I a little shock for you. Little shock! Melquiadez Bello. How have he left? Son of a bitch! I'll kill you, coward. Going somewhere? How much do you receive for my family? Do not know what you're talking about. How could you? Son of a bitch. I protected you! -Who sent the photos? -I do not know. Who sent the photos? Who sent me photographs, motherfucker? Who sent the photos, motherfucker? Who sent me the photos? Who sent me the photographs, bastard? They said don't hurt them. I lost a lot of money because the World Cup. They said they would help me. I did not know, I swear. I did not know they were going to take them. Because of a bet? -A bet of shit? -I beg you... Because of a fucking soccer match? Go fuck yourself. Who is with my child? Who is with my family? Say me who is. Say, you bastard. Do not you dare die! Motherfucker do not you dare die! Motherfucker do not you dare die! Motherfucker do not you dare die! Motherfucker do not you dare die! Do not die. Come on. Move! Come on... Here... On your knees! Lift up your head! We will not kill you still. Your family did not pay. This guy is pissing now. Coward. If we're still here, is because your family did not want to cooperate. Good evening. Tonight vote freely. -Yeah, Ugalde's? -To my mind, it sucks! One more note. -At this election day... -Today is July 2... 2006. 24 days! 24 days in this hell. Think, please. Think. -Max, leave us alone, please. -Yes, ma'am. Sit. I want answers, and now. Lady Susana, with all due respect, I think things would better if everyone does their part. You do not know what is live in fear, is it? I am more afraid of the police than criminals. But I will not stand idly, seeing my family disappearing. My brother-in-law is a good person. But only with good intentions do not come you nowhere. I want you to tell me what you know. The truth. Very well, I'll tell you what we have by now. For now, we have three lines of investigation. I know I should not talk about it, but... as you should know, Do?a Susana, your husband had a second family. We thought that the lover her husband was involved, but it seems she knows nothing. We will continue to investigate her until find a more certain line. Max. Madam, I had not seen you. Before go away, I would to ask you something. Do you know Arturo's lover? Madam. I just saw a young girl. -Thanks, Maxi. -Good night. Excuse. On the second track, we found that Maxi's brother, Doroteo, had a criminal record But after his last arrest in 2006, he remained clean. Effectively, he now is dedicated to boxing, but we do not know where is now. We are waiting for our sources tell us. About the third track, what worries us is that we lost the money trail. And this is very disturbing. The money was transferred to a bank in the Canary Islands, but unfortunately we can not investigate the transaction. Without the money, ma'am. We can not do anything. "I love you." ... the last eight here in Johannesburg... Can not enter ma'am. Got 2 minutes? I need to talk to you. Susana, what a surprise. Leave us alone please. Listen. I know things among us has not ended well. But at the end Arturo did everything you wanted. In what was Arturo involved? -What are you talking about? -I know he had business with you. For once in your life, tell me the truth. My dear, you know well that your husband no longer works for me. Listen, idiot. Do not go to me with stories. I know he had business with you! Susana, I do not want to lose respect for you. Your husband is quite grown to know what does. -You can't come here... -They kidnap him. The family bank account is empty. Do you know where the money is? -Susana... -Where is that Arturo invested? -But... -Has you the money? Listen, Susana, this is a very big bussiness. There are many people involved. Withdraw money can be very dangerous. More than the death of Arturo? I do not know what you was doing. I do not want to know. It'll resolve after. I should pay the ransom. I need that money. I want my family money. I tell you one thing, bastard. Whatever happens with Arturo, the same will happen to you. You take long! Excuse, guy. I'm late because of Cartucho. You and your fucking dog! You're lucky the Teacher have a watchdog. -Can you breathe? -Badly. Thank you very much. -Who won? -The fucking french eliminated Brazil. It was beautiful to see. I mean the polls. Won Obrador? I do not know. Bronco, do you want where is your family? Search a "Spirit" red in the junkyard. Give your gun to Iguana. You was talking to this motherfucker? Motherfucker do not play with me. It's over. Kill him. I said to shoot him! Kill him, or I'll kill your sister. Shall I start with this? Do you want to see, my hand don't tremble. Do not do it. Do not do it. Congratulations, Iguana, you are one of ours. Passed the test, bastard. What did you think, bastard? What he was going to turn around? In this world there is no justice. And do you know why? Because God forgives us all. He forgives all our sins. I have something for you. I know who the culprit is. But he is well protected. I can't do anything. Come to see me. He called Kaliman. He has a long list criminal history. Assaults, blackmail, extortion. But he is well protected. Always gets away. He is the right arm of the Madrina. We have orders don't touch him. He was who kidnapped your son. What will you do? Come on! Come on! Come on! Shit! Goal! Come on boy! Goal! Goal. Yes! Shut up, bastards! Shut up! ... scored a golden goal for Turkey. Turkey won the match! 1-0 against Senegal, with a golden goal of Ilhan Mansiz. It's crazyness here at the stadium... -... Figo goes to... -Passa to Cristiano, idiot. Shit! Passes the ball... Today will play Portugal. If you want, can turn the volume up. I need to speak with the Teacher, in person. I can not do anything. Referee, use the whistle! I have to try my luck. Help me. Did you want to talk to me, little boy? There is a way to get the money without my family knowing. But you must meet with my partner. Her name is Cecilia Jeza. She has money and knows what to do. Son of a bitch! Lost a finger because of your greed with my money, bastard. I'm not a thief, I am a professional. Pulga... I have something important for you, bastard. Tomorrow, get the money. I hate this phone. It is normal that they don't call when they say. I also hate it. Did you see him? He was just a little baby. He was named Emiliano. -I did not kill him. -Little baby... I'm saying I did not kill him! They are using you... They are using you to kill me. They want to take control over my territory. So they wash their hands. Do not you understand? -Who is? -Here no one ever knows who enter and who exit. I do not know. I do not know. -Where is that bastard? -That's simple, stupid! He is already in my territory. The restaurant. You are thinking that all this will end badly and tomorrow they will kill me. I do not want longer continue with this. I want to stop. Do you know that... since they blindfold me I learned to see otherwise. I could make a detailed picture of each of you. How is the aspect of you... How speak... How walk... All except the Teacher. Because I thought I had seen his face when I was kidnapped. He would not expose that. Now I know it could not be him. Iguana, you are different. Do you like boxing. Has strong and hard hands. I know you want to help me. You has to choose, Iguana. Play your cards well. If you want to tell it, then it must be good. Goal of Ronaldo! Should be prohibited Brazil participates in the World Cup, always wins. ... the World Cup 2002 Ronaldo managed his second goal... I'm going to the bathroom. ... the first in minute 66 and now Brazil has just scored the second... and only in few minutes get your fifth World Cup Come here, boy. Do you like this here?

Go away there! Lupe. It's me. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Damn. Don't think that I am who takes all decisions No, Lupe. I obey the orders of someone, which in turn complies the orders of another. In this world, there is always someone higher up. Bring that bastard here! You are going, bastard! I told you could tell it. Your family must have paid, bastard. So, you can see your child and your hot blonde. I mean, your wife. It is almost over, bastard. Iguana! Bring me that bastard here! Hold. Only the last round. Let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. Beware, there are some steps. Low your head. Bring that bastard here! On your knees! This bastard's family fucked us. They killed Rodolfo! -Who? -The Pulga, stupid. They killed the Pulga because this bastard. You left to convince, bastard. I will not fight with you. I'll give you the part of the Pulga. -Go back, stupid! -Son of a bitch, bastard! Low the fucking gun. Low the racket, Doroteo.

Do not mention my sister, motherfucker! You will see what good for cough, bastard! Shoot him, motherfucker. Let's see if you have courage. Do not do it, Lupe. Do not do it. -I want to show you something. -No, Lupe. No! No! No! No! "Emiliano" "Salvation" This here is my jungle. I am a hyena. I decide who lives and who dies. Damn... What did I do? Forgive me, please. Forgive me, man. I just wanted you come out alive. My name is Doroteo. Save you, Doroteo. And tell my story. As I said, the Soccer World Cup. A sacred moment when anything can happen. 30 when you risk everything. From one World Cup to another, lost track of time. It was not for me to tell the story, but maybe someone, for another World Championship, at another time, can tell it better. Goal of Spain! Andres Iniesta... forseeing the goalkeeper output... Stop the ball on chest... and push the ball until the bottom Spain world champion soccer Here, the keys your home. -I'm alive. -Stay there. Wait two minutes that will pass a car to pick you up. Face your worst enemy, your own team, your people. Your fate depends on a decision. One false move, You must fight with what you have. You should know how to play well, to tell a story. Your fate depends on a decision, One false move, a look into the void, and it is the end. Receive, my dear friends... Go forward with everything, champion. In the red corner, the hero of Tlalnepantla, Doroteo "Pu?os de Piedra". As someone said to me, to live in Mexico is risking one's life every day. Sometimes one wins to tell the story. sometimes not.
