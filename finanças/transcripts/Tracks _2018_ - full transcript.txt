Don't do that. I get it. I get it. We are a half hour into a ten day trip around Europe. And you decide now is a good time to bring it up. I'm wearing shorts, yeah? With these legs. I spent about 20 quid on sun cream. That's like... That's ten pound per leg. I spent three weeks growing this beard. This here beard. Cultivating it. Length. And now you decide to tell me you don't like it. Okay, I'm very sorry. I didn't know it meant that much to you. I grew this beard because it's trendy. It makes me trendy. You're not trendy. You're just jealous 'cause you can't grow a beard. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what I can do? I can grow everything else. What do you mean? Well, I mean, I just won't shave anything. For... the rest of the trip? You know, not my, not my legs. Not my armpits. Not my vagina. But what do you hope to achieve by doing that? Nothing. You're just being childish. Fine. I'm not shaving. That'll do. Just a little trim. Hello, Mum. No. Bow chicka wow wow. Oh, stop it. - What are you doing? - What? You're filming me? I thought that's why we bought the camera. No, we did not buy a GoPro to film a sex tape. - Then why did we buy it? - You know why we bought it. To document our trip. Oh, brilliant. - Is that it, then? - What do you think? - But I've got a hard-on. - Good night, Chris. I love you. Now you're putting me off, mate. You're putting me right off. Just me and you now. Welcome to France. Bonjour. Ca va? Shower cap in France. Didn't think to put on pants? I panicked. Here we are in Paris. Bonsoir. - Oh, bonjour! - Bonjour. Bonjour. Well, Nice seems lovely. Don't start, Chris. I'm not in the mood. - For what? - For you being a sarcy twat. Sorry. Do people actually live in Nice? What did I say? It's late. Everyone's in bed, which is where we should be. Should we just start walking or something? Walking where? I don't know, find the nearest hostel. What, just walk in a random direction - and hope to find a hostel? - Yeah. What do you think, left or right? Left? We'll go right, then. - Bonsoir. - Bonsoir. Um, you got a room for the night? Nice eyes. Thanks. There are tours... Is that your boyfriend? Yeah. It's cozy, innit? Brilliant. Lucy? ♪ Lucy Lucy? What? Well... I was thinking, while I'm up here... Chris, you are literally 5 foot off the ground. I know, but... You can drown in an inch of water. What's that got to do with anything? Well I was thinking... What if I do a wizz in the middle of the night, and it trickles down into your mouth and drowns you? Do you ever think about anything you say before you actually say it? Not really. No. Our lives would just be really long, awkward silences, wouldn't they? Trust me, it's just as awkward without them. Lucy? I do love you. I do love you. Night, Lucy. Night, Chris. Should we get a hotel? No, get a hostel. Equality. Okay, now. Okay. I love you. Bye. Bye. Um, thanks. No worries. Do you wanna boom-boom? Excuse me? Um... No. Chris? What? The guy downstairs just asked me if I wanted to boom-boom him. He did what? Fucking boom-boom my girlfriend. Foreign prick. Defending someone's honor in a minute. How rude. How fucking rude. Scuzi. Did you just ask to boom-boom my girlfriend? - Yeah. - Just like that? Not even gonna deny it? Why would I deny it? 'Cause she's my girlfriend. - I want to boom-boom her. - Stop saying that. I'm gonna boom-boom you. - You wanna fuck me? - No. Boom-boom. Boom-boom you up. - Are you gay? - What? No. I don't want to boom-boom you. I want to boom-boom you up. - Smash your face in. Kick your arse. - Kiss? - Kick. - Lick? Not lick, kick. - Are you guy? - No, I'm not gay. It's okay. Does your girlfriend know? Say I'm gay again. Go on, I dare you. I double dare you. Gay. - Get off, - Get up! Don't pull it! Ow! Oh, my God! Lucy, he won't let me go. Chris, what the fuck are you doing? So? They put a finger up my arse. You get into a fight and they put a finger up my arse. How does that work? Oh, my God! - Are you okay? - It's not funny. And they fine me. - Five hundred euro. - Five hundred euros? Well, that's like half our budget. - I know. - It's mental. Shit. What are we gonna do? I think I dislodged my anus. Is that even possible? Chris, come on. This is serious. I'm being serious. Five hundred euros for a finger up me arse. And the French have got big fingers. Look, I'll see if my mom can transfer that money. - You think she will? - Of course she will. All right then. Okay. Hold on. Yeah. Right, brilliant. I love you. Love you. Bye, bye. What's that? It's all they had. Oh, give it here. Well? She wasn't in. I left a message. Oh, great so we just sort of stand here and wait until she ring us back, then, shall we, dickhead? I left a message explaining the situation. Also to transfer 500 euros into our account. Said I'd call back a bit later. I should really get some credit for this thing. Dick brain. You tell her you got arrested? It was a message. I left a message. Yeah, but how did you say that we lost the money? It was a message. But what did you say? It was a message. Do you not understand the concept of a message? You're trying to be funny? Just had a finger up my arse, yeah? Just had to ring my mum to ask for some money. If that's not funny then what is? All right, fine. What do you wanna do until then? - All right, pub? - Pub. You know, I was talking to my mum and she thinks that a trip like this is gonna make us or break us. - Oh, really? - Mmm-hmm. What about you? Do you think same as your mum? I think that we've been together for quite long time, so. I think if we can't last a couple of weeks together, we're up shit creek, really, aren't we? Right, then. Let's say we drink a couple of these bad boys and... have a look around this shit hole. - Orange gina. - Orangina. Orange gina. Listen to me. Orangina. Listen to me. Orange gina. How can you not hear that that's not the same? Allo. Uh, order. Oh. Check this out. We would like to order some lunch, s'il vous plait. Come again? Um... I will let my girlfriend take over from me. All yours. Um... Yeah, oui, mate. Kapti proti pu. D'accord. Merci. What did you order, anyway? Just the four fish, then? Fucking hell, it's beautiful, isn't it? Which I can't believe we just found it. I-I can't believe I'm seeing it with you. Shut up! No, I wouldn't do anything like this without you, would I? 'Cause I'm, like, just a fucking idiot all the time. Poncing around like a bloody dinosaur. Run away, run away. Oh, you make me laugh, you idiot. After you. I can't see any al fresco on this menu. What? What do you mean? Al fresco. A mate wanted to eat al fresco when you go to a foreign land. Yeah, but Chris, you know that's not a dish, right? That's just eating outside. - Oh. - Yeah. - Fucking hell. - Thought it was some sort of salad. Oh, okay we're in. We're in. How do, how we do this? Just, just kiss me. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Fuck me in the toilet. We've never done that. I've got a dress on so it'll be really easy. Just hike it up. You know what I mean? Okay. - Shit. Ah. - Ah, shit. Oh, you look amazing. Ah, shit. - Yeah, shit. - Yeah. - Oh, shit. - Oh, my God. I can't believe we're doing this. Oh, shit. Ah, shit. - Oh shit, oh shit. Oh shit! - Ah shit, yeah. - Oh shit. Oh... - What you mean? What you mean? Oh my God! Shit! - Oh, shit. - Look I love you, but I can't unsee this. - Oh! I need to get out. - No. - I need to get out. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you dare! - I've got to get out. - No! No. - Don't you dare get out! - I've got to get out. - You can't... Chris, stop! - I've got to get out. - Stop, stop... - I've got to get out. Please, I've got it pouring out of me. - Oh! - Oh, God! Ugh, it's so bad. No! Stop it. Stop it. Oh, God! Ah, it's still coming. God, it's still coming. It's like lava. Ugh, oh, God! Oh, my God, I cannot believe that we just got chucked off a train. Fuck! It's not like having a shit's illegal. Well, it should be. I've never smelled anything like that. Oh, thanks for the sympathy. How can I sympathize with that shit? I'm hungry. - Can you pass me your bag? - Why? I want to get a chocolate bar. Ugh, God, can't you just wait for the train? It's like a four hour wait. Ugh, don't wanna get them out of my bag. You ate them all, didn't you? What? You ate all the chocolate bars. No, I did not eat all the fucking chocolate bars! You so did. That's your lying face. I don't have a lying face. Everybody has a lying face, and that's yours. All right, maybe I did eat a few. I was hungry in the night. Fucking hell! There were like ten chocolate bars in there. No wonder you shit yourself. There were not like ten chocolate bars in there. - How many were there, then? - I don't know. Nine? You ate nine whole chocolate bars? Well, two of them were Freddos and we all know that Freddos aren't really proper chocolate bars, are they? You ate the Freddos? You know I love a Freddo. It's my favorite. Did you even think about me while you were doing it? Oh, come on, Chris! I wasn't fucking someone. I was hungry and I had some chocolate. Some chocolate? Some chocolate? A couple of Roses at Christmas is some chocolate. A line of Fruit & Nut is some chocolate. Nine chocolate bars is a whole fucking entire universe of chocolate. Oh, well, thank God you're not being dramatic about it. Dramatic? You always do this, make me out to be dramatic. You'd do the same if the boot was on the other foot. No, I wouldn't. You so would. You so would. Do I have to remind you about nacho-gate? Oh, no, you don't have to remind me, because you know why? We always, always go back to fucking nacho-gate and you throw them right in my face anytime we have this argument. It was an accident and you didn't speak to me for three whole days. Yes, because it was an idiotic thing to do! I sat on some nachos! And not only that, they were cheap nachos. Does it have anything to do with how cheap they were? It's a matter of principles. Do nachos have principles? - Human beings do! - Human beings? Have you actually heard the words that are coming out your mouth right now? Yeah, I have, actually. And do you wanna hear another thing? You are a stupid, imbecilic, lazy, big-toed, hairy lips, slightly stretchy, - one-balled... - Oh! - ...dead-eyed, little buggy... - Oh! ...massive nosed, - fucking... - Mmm. - ...hairy... - Mmm. - ...bollocked dick! - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah?

Well I mean, she was really hot. So? So it literally took him about six months to build up the courage to kiss me. He's known this girl for... six seconds? And he could've stopped it? Um, yes, he could've stopped it. What? It's not that hard, is it? Okay. So, you were supposed to stop me. Okay. Well, cool. Sorry. So, he could be telling the truth. I mean, yeah.

That is what they say. ♪ I'm here in Venice Right, that's it, tonight we're going out. ♪ I'm going to find her ♪ And tell her I'm sorry We're going to go out, we're going to have fun, we're going to go dancing. - I've got nothing to wear. - It's fine. I know the perfect place. Sorry... Okay. I'm going to go. I'll go. Bye. Friendly here, aren't they? Hello, old lady. It's hot, innit? I don't do that well in the heat. Or the cold. That's why I got an ice cream. And a sweater in me bag. Good work with the coat. Good move, smart. You don't have anywhere to stay, do you, around here? It's just, the last place I was at was, um... Well, it wasn't very nice. There was a big shit on the floor. It was like a French stick. I haven't seen anything like it. I've had a pretty shitty couple of days. Found out my girlfriend's pregnant. That's amazing. It's pretty good news. Then she caught me kissing another girl and ran off. Well, I wasn't kissing another girl, she was kissing me, but she doesn't know that. So, I'm pretty much just wandering around Venice like a prick. She's beautiful, my Lucy. She's amazing. Like you... You were probably beautiful when you were younger. You're still all right now, you know. I know I'm not much to look at. But I'm funny. I've got pretty good-sized penis, medium-sized. You'll never know, though. Yeah, so that's me, just wandering around Venice. Let me know if you fancy doing anything later 'cause I'm at a loose end. Probably go out, dinner, dance, you know. All right, well, it's been nice chatting. I love a good chat. So I'll get off now. See you later, old lady. Mia! - I think he fancies you. - Oh, my God, Mia! He doesn't fancy me. - I think he fancies you. - He doesn't. He fancies you. Everyone fucking fancies you. You're kidding me. - Oh, my God! - Oh! Hello. This is Chris and Lucy's trip to Europe. Here's Chris. It's not Lucy, is it? No, it's a big fucking bag, not Lucy. Do you know where she is? Do you know why I don't know where she is? 'Cause she fucked off. Walked off, because... because of me. Because of how I behave. Because I don't think. I don't... I don't think about her enough. But all she does is think about me. So, you stayed here even though he left you? Hell, yeah. This is my home. Not just gonna run away. Fuck that. Yeah, but weren't you scared? Oh, my God. Terrified. But that's how I knew I was doing the right thing. If you're not living on the edge then you're taking up too much space. I mean, I'm not saying that's how everyone should live their lives but it worked for me. I'm a fucking wanker. I don't even see it. I walked around in Venice. I went on a gondolier. Only it's not a gondolier, it's called a gondola. And I know it's called a gondola but I say gondolier 'cause I think it'll make her laugh. And it does. 'Cause I do all the other stuff. I don't say, I don't... Doesn't make her laugh. I don't... think. So I went on it on my own. I sat next to an old lady on a bench on my own. And she was lovely. Couldn't understand a fucking work I was saying. But Lucy does understand... the words I say. That's why I should think what I say before I say it. I couldn't be more terrified right now if I tried. Fuck him, he's a dick... I'm pregnant. So... there's that. Let me ask you a question. Do you love him? Yeah. Fucking hell. Look at the rain. I deserve this, I deserve to be... out in the rain... on my own. And she deserves to be in somewhere... nice, with nice people. But we're meant to be. You know, when canals go in Venice, go to places. We're supposed to go to a place. So I'm gonna go on a canal tomorrow and find her. And also I'll behave, and say sorry. And I'll call it a gondola. Lucy... I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Excuse me. Um, you haven't seen this girl, have you? No. But you're not really looking. - No. - No? - No. - No? No. It's nice, this place, isn't it? Got you there, didn't I? Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. Um... You haven't seen this girl, have you? Is she staying here? No. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I'm sorry, mate. Aw. That's all right, mate. - Have a good day. - You too. - Hi. - Hello. Um, I'd like a room please. I've seen you before. Do we know each other? I'm not sure, but I've seen you before. On a... on a film. I'm not an actress. Um... Can I just get a room, please? Certainly. Helloo! Helloo! Hello. - Hello. - Can I help you? Yes, you can. I'd like a room, please. - Oh, fine... - Tala-ba-da-da. Before you ask... Mmm-hmm This ain't my first rodeo. - There you go. - Thank you. Zom-zom. Can I... can I just say... that you have beautiful eyes. Both of them. Contacts? - No. - Amazing. So, how much is it for the old? So, that'll be 69 euro. Stone the fucking crows, mate. 'Struth! I want a room, not the building. Would you like the room or not? Yeah, I do. - Fine. - I was just being funny. - So... - There you go old girl. Count it out, old bean. There you go, mate. - Thank you very much... - Keep the fucking change. That's um... room 11, 3rd floor. Good evening. Have a good night's sleep. - Good night. - You'll need it. I love you. What's that? Ah! What the fuck? Ah, shit! Whose that? Whose that? I'm on a merry go round and I don't like it. - Oh, good morning. - Morning. - Did you have a good stay? - I did, yeah. There was a very loud guy this morning, though. Oh, I think I know who you mean. I hope he wasn't too much of a nuisance. Just drunk, was he? Yeah. Bit of a flirt too, actually. - Brilliant. - Harmless enough, though. I think he had a rough day. Ah, yeah. I know the feeling. Is there anything I can help you with? Can you tell me the way to the Piazza Della Liberta? Sure. Um, at the door turn left and at the end of the street turn right and it's about four blocks away. - Okay, perfect. Thank you. - Okay. You have a great day. - You too, Ciao. - Bye. Excuse me. Excuse me! - Ah, good morning. - Good morning. How are you this morning? Um, well I feel my head's gonna explode. Other than that, great thanks. But you found your girl, though? - What? - You found her? The girl in the film. You found her? No. I've pretty much checked every hostel in Florence. No luck. - She was here at breakfast. - What? At breakfast I saw her. - At breakfast? - Yes. - Here? - Yes. - Is she still here? - I think so. Uh, I will just check. Emma, could you help this gentleman, please? My girl, you saw my girl? - Um, the pretty one? - Yes, the pretty one. - My Lucy. - She's your girlfriend? Yes, all right, I know I'm punching but where... where is she? She left five minutes ago. Where did she go? Piazza Della Liberta. How do I get there? Walk out, turn left, at the end of the street, turn right and then it's about four blocks from there. - You better hurry, though. - Thank you.

Lucy. Chris? Lucy. How did you find me? We were staying at the same hostel. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, my God! You were the drunk guy from last night. Guilty. You were the drunk guy who flirted with the receptionist, again. That hag? Not my cup of tea. No. She's really not your type, is she? Look, you're my type. Do you want to kneel down or shall I get up? What do you think? I'll get up. Oh! I don't want to let go. You might run off again. You're not gonna run off, are you? I've been thinking. I'm sorry for acting like such a... A twat. What's twat in Italian? Twat. Is it? So, um... I've been everywhere. On my own. But I brought me bag. - How is your bag? - It's fine. Nice. Good.

I want to be a good dad. That's what good dads do. I know you don't believe that now, but... - There's two of... - No. I do. I believe that. - You do? - Yeah. Of course I do. Come here.

Let's just make tracks. What? What does that mean? You know, let's make tracks. I've never heard that before. Of course you have. I've literally never heard anyone say that, ever. Well, it's a saying, isn't it? No. Let's make like sheep and get the flock out of here. - That's a saying. - Okay. Let's mate like a tampon and get out of this bloody hole... - Oh, my God! Chris. - That's a saying. Let's make like a donkey dick and hit the road. Okay. I get it. Let's make like a tree and leave. - Chris? - Let's make tracks?
