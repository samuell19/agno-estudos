Oh. Who’s calling me now? Hello. Assalam-o-Alaikum. Walaikum Assalam. Give me news of Karachi, Atiya. Everything is fine here, Bhai Ji. What are Begum Sahiba’s preoccupations? Begum Sahiba’s preoccupations? Well, for the past three days Begum Sahiba’s mother, father, nieces and nephews have all come over. Do you know? She has been taking them all over town. Our Begum Sahiba really indulges and spends Sahab’s money extravagantly. At the very least she must have spent about 3 to 400 thousand just on her own family. So what? Let her spend the money extravagantly. What is your problem with that? Sure thing. When he marries girls younger in age than himself then he is bound to make them happy with his money to have some control over them, right? Keep your tongue under control and talk in your senses, Atiya! I take out the tongues from the throats of people who speak wrongly or meanly about Sahab! I… That’s not what I meant, Bhai Ji! I have made a mistake. Please forgive me! It slipped out of my mouth in ignorance! Next time, stay within your limits when you speak! Or else it won’t turn out good for you. Yes, Sir? Miss Noor-ul-Ain, work on this Report, and study these drawings of the Pressurized Water Reactor. Complete this Report by 9 o’clock tonight. Sir…. Miss Noor-ul-Ain, this isn’t a lot of work. 50% of the work has already been done on this. You just have to complete this Report. If you still face any problems in it then take some help from Ahmer. Okay… And do remember that this Report will be going to the CEO, so please be very careful. Don’t make any mistakes and work with utter concentration, okay? Okay. Thank you. Okay, girls and boys, guess what? All of our Bosses have gone into their offices and it’s party time! We are going out to dinner. Whoever wants to come can join us! Because tomorrow is my Birthday and who has seen tomorrow? So the party’s on me! Come along, man! Let’s go. Let’s go have something. No, a lot of time will be wasted in coming and going. I’ll order something. Okay, as you wish. Okay, Ahmer. I don’t understand anything about how to do this and what I have to do in it. Can you please help me? Don’t know what kind of work the CEO has gotten Mr. Shoaib into. He assigns all of his work to us and goes to the Plant every day. He has also given me two Efficiency Reports to make. Alright then, we will both order something here. He has given me very little time. How should I get this task done? I am feeling scared about making some error. They given me so much work. "You have 3 hours to do it" As if 3 hours means 10 hours... Did you make this Report? Yes, Sir. Do you know how many mistakes there are in this? Sir, there must be minor mistakes in it, otherwise I…. Minor mistakes? You mean if the mistake is a small one or an ordinary one then it is alright to do it? This is the problem with all of you Interns. I wish you guys would show the enthusiasm in doing your work that you show in getting an Internship. This is not your University. This is an actual office of an actual Oil Refinery. Do you know the meaning of your ‘minor mistake’? Do you know the amount of loss that your single ‘minor mistake’ can do for this Company? Sorry, Sir. I…. Don’t apologize. I have to present this Report in a meeting tomorrow morning at 8 o’clock with no ‘minor mistakes’. Thank you. The mistakes really were quite minor. But what else should I have done? An excuse was required after all for a CEO to call his Intern into his office time and again. Hey, you haven’t gone home as yet? Let me just complete this Report. Just let him take out any more mistakes in it this time! Alright then. I’m going off to home. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hello. So, baby. Baby, it is already time to go home. You have not come out as yet. I have been waiting quite a while for you downstairs in the building I’ll be out in just a little while as soon as I complete my work. Please wait a little while longer, okay? Oh, stoke it in the fire! To hell with such a job! We don’t want to have our child do this job! Buwa Ji, Buwa Ji! I will get even more late talking to you. I’m saying that I ‘m coming in a little while. Okay? Okay, fine. I’m cutting the call but I’m telling you one thing. I don’t get this job of yours. Okay, okay. I’m just coming. I love you. Bye, bye. Mr. CEO, this time, just try and find any mistakes in this! Miss Noor-ul-Ain…. Yes? Are you going home? Yes. Come along then. I’ve called the lift. I’m going. I’ll go from here. It’s here. No, actually… Let’s go. Come along. Come along inside. How is Uncle? He’s fine. Good. Are you okay? Please, quickly open the doors! It’s alright. Nothing’s going to happen. Okay, okay… Hurry! Please! It’s alright. Are you alright? Go and sit in the office. I’ll go get some water for you. No, no. I… I’m fine. You don’t look alright. I’m okay. I’ll be okay. Is your driver downstairs? He is downstairs. He’s waiting for me. Come with me then…. No! What sort of job is this, huh? I don’t get it at all. You neither have any time for eating anything nor drinking anything. You are there from morning till night! Oh! Just what office is open till 8 o’clock at night? My child is so exhausted! She is completely tired out. I will have a talk with Sahab that we don’t want her to work to exhaustion. The child has become very weak. That’s it! Enough of this now! Oh, my dearest, what’s the matter? Say something or have you left your tongue in that office as well? My child, tell me. I’m getting very anxious about you! Buwa, why am I like this? Like what, my dearest? Abnormal… God forbid! Who said that to you? I will smash in his face! By the Grace of Allah you are absolutely healthy, completely normal. I’m not normal. I’m not normal, Buwa Ji I see weird and strange nightmares at night. I cannot sleep for several weeks because of such dreams. I cannot turn off the lights in my room. I cannot sleep. I’m scared of the dark. I am claustrophobic. I feel suffocated in closed alleys and closed spaces. Agha Jaan is getting me treated by a Psychiatrist. Unless I have the medications he gives me, I don’t have any peace, I don’t get tranquil and have no peace of mind. How many girls go through such a state, Buwa Ji? Look, my child…. Why does it happen with me? I hide this fact from my friends and from everyone I meet. I am always fearful that if they find out about this state of mine they might assume I am mad or a psycho and leave me! I am not normal…. There’s no way I’m normal, Buwa Ji! I know that I am not normal! My dear child, my love…. Please, quickly open the doors! It’s alright. Nothing’s going to happen. Okay, okay… Hurry! Please! Hey, Sheroo, man, I saw her very upset today. I saw her cry…. I’m sure she must be upset at home even now too. What should I do? I have her Mobile Number. I can give her a call but since she did not give it to me herself so it would be a bit awkward. I have her landline number too. A call can be made on that. Okay… Hello? Hello. Assalam-o-Alaikum. I am Amaan speaking. Is it possible to talk to Noor-ul-Ain? My dear, she has gone to sleep. Okay then, that’s fine. No, if you have a message for her then just tell me. I’ll let her know. No, no. It’s fine. Thank you. Alright, child. Khuda Hafiz. Khuda Hafiz. Sheroo! Humayun has resigned from our Company. He has gone to Singapore within the night without informing anyone. Really? Has he told anyone what he will do there? He hasn’t told anything to anyone. He kept his intentions hidden till the last moment. This is why I had told you to take action against him. He has harmed the Company with grave losses. He has betrayed us and then in the end he has left the Company and went off to Singapore? Wakeel Sahab, I have one advice for you. Impulsiveness and getting emotional means nothing in business. That is why I never take any action on an impulse or in a fit of emotion. I admit that Humayun has greatly and wrongfully harmed this Company. He will get his due punishment when the time comes. Alright then, go ahead and do Agha Sahab’s bidding. Buwa Ji, I am absolutely fine. Nothing is the matter with me. I just got a little emotional last night. Why do you worry so much about me? My child, who else should I worry about if not you? Just don’t stay over too late tonight. Okay? Alright, I won’t stay on for long. Now cut the call. I have a lot of work to do, Buwa Ji. Okay, fine. Oh, yes! Anna? My dear, someone had called for you over the landline yesterday. I forgot to tell you. Who was it? Well that’s the thing. I’ve forgotten the name. It was some guy. He had a very nice name but whoever he was he seemed to be a very capable and well-mannered child. It must be someone else. If he has anything to do for me he will call me directly. Okay, but do come home on time, alright? Okay… Miss Noor-ul-Ain, Ammar Sahab is asking for you. Come in. Take a seat. Assalam-o-Alaikum. Walaikum Assalam. How are you? I’m fine, Sir. How is Uncle? He’s fine as well. This weekend I had gone to play Golf with Ghauri Uncle but Uncle never showed up. I sort of missed him. Where is he? He was not in Islamabad. Okay. I saw your Report. You have corrected all of your mistakes. It means you’re a fast learner. Thank you, Sir. Sir, it is time for the meeting. Okay, I’m coming. Okay, Sir. So, keep working with such dedication. All the best. Oh, no, not at all. I saw the capabilities in you and that is why I have given you this job. So, how does your thankfulness and my graciousness come into all this? For now, this business between us, has to be kept secret. We will tell everyone when it is the right time. Khuda Hafiz. You know what, Ali Bakhsh? There is a huge advantage in playing chess by yourself. You play against your own self and you think from the perspective of the opponent. What move will you make? What move will he make in return? How will you defeat him? You need great concentration and patience for this task but victory is confirmed in the end when your opponent falls down on his face. Check mate. You haven’t gone to sleep yet? Mama, I love it when you play the piano. May I listen to it for a little while? Just for a little while and then you have to get into bed, okay? Mama, how do you play it? Please teach me as well. Come, I’ll teach you. So, this hand you will keep on the cords, okay? Mama, why do you always play this melody? That is because I love this tune a lot and this song as well. Did you like it? Oh, Amaan child… Amaan, my child, what happened to you? Afzal! Afzal, where are you all? Get up, my child. Get up, be brave. Get up, my child. Atiya! Yes, Begum Sahiba. Take this stuff. Take out the meat and vegetables and… In fact there would be fresh cream in it as well. Put that away in the fridge. I’ll tell you what to do with the rest. Okay. Is someone invited to a party today? Yeah, you may assume it to be a party. Hello, Sweetheart. Hello, Farooque. How are you? How can I be without you? Are you missing me? A whole lot. Then, please come to me tonight. Tonight? Look, today is our Wedding Anniversary as well. Now, please don’t refuse, Farooque. Today it is our 7th Wedding Anniversary. Please come. I’m so sorry. I absolutely forgot that. Yeah, but I didn’t forget. I want to make today a very memorable one. I will prepare dinner for you with my own hands In fact, I will bake the cake myself too. Please come. I want you to spend today with me. Will you have dinner prepared by me today? Please? How can one refuse when you ask them with such love? So, you are coming today? Do one thing. Prepare the dinner. I will be with you at exactly 8 o’clock. Thank you so much! I love you so much, Farooque. And I can’t wait to see you. I love you too, my love. Okay then, I’ll see you. Bye. What’s the matter? Who has come? Assalam-o-Alaikum, my child. Walaikum Assalam. You are awake, child? Yes. How are you feeling now? I’m fine. Were there any calls from the office? There were a couple of calls. I have written out the messages. May I bring them if you want? Yes, show them to me. Alright, child. What should I have prepared for you? Just get me a cup of black coffee. Only coffee? Yes, I’m not in the mood to eat anything. My child, you have not had anything to eat since last night. Imaamdin, I’m really not in the mood. Alright. Get my clothes ready. I have to go to a Conference. A Conference? My child, I say you should have rested today. Imaamdin, I’m fine. I’m alright. Get my suit out. I have to be there by 6 o’clock. Okay. Alright. Well done. Well done. That was great. You have had all the work done according to my commands. Your reward will reach whichever account you mention. You look very happy, Sahab. Yes, Ali Bakhsh. Whoever deceives, cheats and betrays me, will always meet with a fearsome end. I will bring Humayun to such a state that his future generations will remember. There is no forgiveness for treachery with me! Humayun will always remember it. Masha Allah! Masha Allah, Baji. Today you are looking as beautiful and pretty as some bride by the Grace of Allah. Thank you, Atiya. It is our wedding Anniversary today. I really wanted to get dressed up for Farooque with the utmost care and love. You’ll see. When Sahab comes today, he will forget about going back. Alright now. Don’t talk too much. Go and concentrate on your work. Go and look in the kitchen. Farooque must be about to arrive. Oh, Baji, everything is ready in the kitchen. Don’t worry at all about that. Check again one more time, Atiya. I want everything to be according to Farooque’s liking today. Yes, absolutely. It will be exactly like that. Anna, my dear, I have kept the milk in your room. Go and have it. Buwa, just give me 5 more minutes. I’ll go to my room and drink it right now. And just why are you sitting with the computer at night? You know quite well that Agha Jaan has forbidden you to use the computer and the mobile phone at night. Okay, Buwa. Just give me 5 minutes. Okay? Promise. Alright but Anna, tell me something. You look very happy tonight… Why? Don’t I look nice to you when I’m happy? It is evident that I will love happiness. I just want to ask. What is this all about? Buwa, it’s just because I probably spent time with Agha Jaan today after several days; he gave me his time and attention. That’s just why I’m happy. Anna… Buwa! She looks so pretty while asleep. Did you make this cake? Come on, let’s cut the cake. I don’t want to talk to you, Farooque! So, should I go away? Yes, go away. If my love has no value and no importance near you then yes, you should go away. Well, Noor-e-Jaan had asked me to stay back with her, otherwise I would have come to you right on time Come, let’s cut the cake. Noor-ul-Ain? I knew that it would be Noor tonight as well! Was it more important for you to go out to dinner with Noor? It is our Wedding Anniversary tonight. Do I not hold any importance for you, Farooque? Does Saira have no meaning in your life? It’s just that Noor has to come into view, after that you can see nothing else, right, Farooque? That’s enough! Enough! Farooque…. I will not tolerate a single word spoken against Noor in that tone of voice! How could you even dare to speak in this condescending tone! You are going to compete with my daughter? Do you have the status and position to do so? You’re hurting me, Farooque! You are insulting me. I am your wife, Farooque! I have given you this position because you are my wife! If only I say those three words right now, then you will be out of my life and this house. This is what your status and position is! This is what your permanent status is in this house! Got it?! Farooque…. Yes, Maqsood. How come you have called me so early this morning? Sir, I had to inform you about one matter. I have just received this news myself. So, what is the news? Sir, Humayun is no more probably sometime last night. Oh! That is indeed bad news. Sir, I am in shock. He was very healthy. Yes, his age was very young too. What happened to him? Sir, I don’t know the entire details but according to the news I have received so far, he was in Police Custody in Singapore. He was charged with smuggling something. The Police inquiry was still ongoing against him. He got so fearful during interrogation that he probably got so terrified that his failed him. He was quite deeply associated with our Company. If the funeral is not being held in Pakistan then atleast call his widow and offer our condolences. Yes, Sir, absolutely. I’ll find out and let you know. Okay. Nargis Buwa…. Nargis Buwa! Yes, Sahab? Have breakfast served. Yes, breakfast is ready. I’ll have it served right now. And wake Noor-e-Jaan. I’m very hungry. I feel like having a hearty breakfast today.
