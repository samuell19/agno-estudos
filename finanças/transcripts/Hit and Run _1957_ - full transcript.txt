Is it good? Hey, Joey .. come over here. Put some bubble-water on ice. As you wish. Any special kind? French? Imported? The best. Ah, domestic is good enough. Let's invest in dames, huh. Did you see that big guy out there? Fourth man in a row. He should know the whole routine by now. I wonder where she's at. With her last lover, I guess. What do you want? I've got a message for one of you dolls. You must mean me. What's the message, cupid? Uhuh .. I think it's for that cutie over there. Well, what do you want? I don't know why, but my boss wants to have a drink with you. Yeah? Well, you can tell your boss he can jump in a lake. What is it, Frankie? Where is she? She didn't want to come, Gus. Why? Now, listen .. do something. Wait. I'll get it. - Okay. Come, Frankie. What are you going to drink? Oh, I don't know. I'll have a beer. A beer? That's all? Here a beer. Give me another quick drink. Quick. Here .. keep the change. Look, Julie. Mr Hilmer is a good customer. He's a real nice guy. He's lots of fun. He comes here every night just to see you. Oh, don't give me that. Honest. He's nuts about you. He owns a gas station. A lot of property. He's loaded. Who is that guy with him? His mechanic. He takes him with him every night as a bodyguard. You know, just in case the old guy gets stinko. And needs protection. Ah, come on. Drink up. Huh? And don't spill it again. I know it was a trick. You can't fool me. Well is it a promise? I don't like to get sick. I can't take that stuff. I know. You are a nice girl. To your beautiful, big eyes, huh. Frankie, give me more bubble-water. Cone on, Gus. It's late. You've had enough. Hey, what is he? Your watchdog or something? I won't bite him. Why don't you? He sits here all night like a house detective. A house detective. Ha. I like that. He's alright. He's my pal. Okay. Johnny, bring me the bill. Twelve dollars and 78 cents. Let's see. Here .. the rest is for you. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Frankie, give this young lady my card. I didn't bring any with me, Gus. - Ah, stop that. Here .. you can come to see me anytime. If you need new tires, lubrication, change oil, everything is on the house. Alright? You are very generous, Mr Hilmer, but .. I don't have a car. - Oh, you don't have a car? Say Frankie, what happened to that jalopy mister .. uh .. Whatshisname? Bob Barrett. You could fix it. Oh, he can fix everything. He's a great mechanic. Oh. Frankie, give me some more bubble-water. Maybe you shouldn't drink any more, Mr Hilmer. You look tired. Isn't she a doll? How she cares for my health. Huh? Yeah .. smart. Real smart. Maybe not as smart as you are. Ah, leave him alone. You know, I am used to investing in .. dames. But here it's all tradition. Don't kid yourself, Mr Hilmer. I'm no better than the others. Ah, don't say that. You're a wonderful girl. You know, a girl like you I could marry .. anytime. Well, why don't you? What do you say, Frankie? Cut it out, Gus. You're loaded. You don't know what you're doing. Ah, shut up. I know exactly what I'm doing. Hey, you. Come here .. come here. Play me a wedding march. I want to hear how it sounds to a retired widower. It sounds horrible. I'll be right back. Hi, Frankie. Hey. What do you say, beautiful? Where were you last night? At the gym. I go every Thursday. That's my day off. Oh, I forgot. Hey, they're big. Seventeen a pound. What are you doing tonight? Going out with the boss. A stag party. Down at the Roadhouse. Lots of girls, huh? Nah .. just that crazy bunch. You know, the anti-superstition club. You're kidding. What's that? They get together on the 13th of every month. They drink and they make fun of superstitions. They must be nuts. What for? Anti-superstition? Well, you got to be anti-something nowadays. I can't help laughing at it myself. They're like a bunch of kids. Tonight, they'll be extra wild. Friday the 13th. I've never heard of such nonsense. Do you have to go with him? Well, he kind of likes to have me along. Hi. Is Mr Hilmer in? - Busy. Never mind. I want to talk to him. Where is he? In the back. - In the house? Who's she? In a variety show at Barney's. I thought they left town already. Is anybody home? Oh look who is here. Little Trudy. "Julie", if you don't mind. - Ah "Julie". I'm sorry. Sorry, Julie. It is nice that you came. Sit down. You know, I had trouble finding this place. Because everybody tells me how rich you are, so I expected something different. Well, that's why I am rich. Because I am saving my money. This is good enough for me. I came to see you about that car you promised me. Oh yeah, I remember. You need your own car. You see, my show folds the day after tomorrow, and .. Well I want to quit show business anyway, so .. Maybe you didn't mean what you said, but .. If I had a car, maybe I could find another job. Right. Let me see. A car. Wait. Frankie. Yeah? What happened to that car Mr Brubaker brought here? Dumped. At the junk yard. It fell apart, Gus. No chance. Can't we fix something else for her? Not that I know of. You remember Julie? Oh yeah. How could I forget her. Say, can't we look? Maybe there is something we can fix? You go right ahead. I got to stay here so, go on. Come. We'll see what we can find. Come. Gee, it's like walking in a cemetery. Well, that's what it is. It always reminds me of a defeated army. It all looks so sad. - Uhuh. Wait. I think this .. This is Mr Brubaker's car. Now let me see. Oh .. no. Frankie was right. No good. I'd like to help you, little girl. I know. You like to invest in dames. Oh you remember that? Tell me. What kind of a job are you looking for? Oh it doesn't make any difference. Hostess, salesgirl .. Anything is better than this travelling business. You'd be surprised. I know how to do a lot of things. Washing, ironing. I even know how to cook. Hmm. You'd make a good housewife, huh? Say, now I remember. I was so loaded that night I almost proposed to you. Well, sort of. But nobody could take you seriously. Except that Frankie of yours. He was quite upset. Oh, you don't like him? What difference does it make. Tell me. Do you think I could hitchhike to Bloomsville and get a job there? Well, give me time. I've some friends, customers. Maybe we will find something. Say, I have a club meeting tonight. Maybe afterwards I can drop into you place and we can have a drink? Or two? Or three of four and then you could marry me again. Tell me, were you ever married? Uhuh. What happened? - She died. Some idiot said that I killed her. It's a lot of nonsense. Why should I kill her? I didn't love her. Oh .. you only kill a woman when you love her? I see your point. Would you ever get married again? Me .. married again? Never. Never in my life. Gee, I just love it. And how about this here, huh. Gus. You're so good to me .. why? I don't know. Maybe because I'm an old idiot. Every penny invested in dame is lost. Believe me. Well, it depends what you expect from your investment. That's a sly answer. Well, wait and see. What's that? Oh, a scar. A souvenir. Gambling, you know. You're a gambler? - Well, I take my chances. I took my chance with you too. You can say that again. Oh Frank .. what is it? Mr Baxter is here to pay his bill. I'll be right there. Will you let him get away with that? Oh he doesn't mean it. He's a nice boy. He tries to protect me. Then maybe you should have listened to him. Say, what's going on between you two? Oh nothing. Just one of those things. Look, he's a great mechanic. Such a guy, I couldn't find any place. Believe me. Then tell him to shut up and mind his own business. I'm your wife now and he must respect me. Gus .. Mr Baxter hasn't got much time. - Alright. I'll fix it. Now. Smile. Smile. Smile, I said. Gee, she's pretty. - And nicely dressed, too. I wonder why she's married that one. I'll give you three guesses. Aren't you going to help her with her packages? What do I look like? Her butler? Mrs Hilmer. Are you expecting documents? - No, nothing. Well, here is your mail. Put it on top. - Thank you. Goodbye. Wait, honey. Why didn't you honk the horn? I would have helped you. That guy wouldn't move his finger. Oh, he's busy. Yeah. Fooling around with girls. Here's your mail. - Thank you. Gus, how long will that bookkeeping take you? I can do it later. Why? Because there's a sale on at Simons. I'd like to buy a few things for the house. Oh, you don't need to go to sales. Mrs Hilmer's husband makes a lot of dough. Mrs Hilmer prefers saving good money instead of throwing it around. Smart. Saving for the rich widow, huh? You've got a morbid mind. What made you say that? I'm just kidding. Oh. Pardon me. I forgot to knock. See what I mean? - Come here, Frank. I got things to do, Gus. - Come here. Never mind. Come and sit down. Alright, General. Shoot. I'll take the keys and I'll be back in a little while. Wait. I'll go with you. Look, Gus. I know what you're going to say, so I'll make it simple. I quit. You don't mean it? Why not? You can fire me any time. I can quit any time. There's nothing to it. Wait a minute .. you must have a reason. It must make sense. You do a lot of things that don't make sense, so why should you .. I know exactly what's on your mind, so you'd better cut it out. This kind of talk. I don't like it. That's exactly why I want to quit, Gus. Why should we cut each other's throats after all that "my best pal" business? I know what's eating you, Frankie. You sure have changed. So have you, Gus. I'd have worked for you for nothing. You were a lot of fun. But, now I don't care. Because the bubble-water went to your head and you married yourself a .. Shut up! Thanks, Mrs Hilmer. For saving my life. Don't worry, Gus. I won't let you down. For old friendship's sake. I'll give you enough time to get another guy, so don't worry. I'll wait. He's a great guy. You swallow everything. But honey, you are prejudiced. He was always like a friend, like a son to me. He protected me when somebody wanted to make a sucker out of me and .. Is that why he lives up there? So he can watch you day and night? The room was empty. What's wrong with that? Besides, I hate to be alone. You are not alone now. That's true. I'm a lucky dog. You know, darling. I've made up my mind. I .. invest some more in you. I'll buy you that nice stole that we saw the other day up at Cormack's. You mean that cape? Well, the smaller one is nice, too. As a matter of fact it looks much better on you. You will see .. Look in the mail. I'll take my coat inside. National Security Bank. Oh yeah, that's the statements. It's time. Campbell's Television and Radio shop. That's not urgent. Throw it away. And this is from .. San Quentin. Give it to me. Oh. You know, I knew a guy some time ago. And he got into trouble. And probably the parole board asks me now if .. I would be willing to .. you know .. Why don't you look? Open it. Later. I must finish this here. Then we must go to this Cormack's. You know, I promised you that .. stole. I'll take my coat and we go. Ah, that roast was delicious. I'm afraid I ate too much. Then we'll have the rice pudding later. You want to go for a walk? - I just came back. That's not much of a walk. To the incinerator and back. Oh .. spying on me, huh? If you want to have your own secrets, it's alright with me. I told you what it was all about. Don't get excited. I don't care. [ Door knocks ] Who is that? Come in. Oh, look who is here. Our friendly undertaker, Mr Krantz. You know him, Julie? It's nice to see you again, Mr Krantz. We met at our wedding. The pleasure was all yours, Mrs Hilmer. Come in. - Wait. My wife is outside if you don't mind. She's changing a tire. We had a blow-out. That guy kills me. Come in, Sugar. You can do it later. Sure .. have some coffee with us. Fresh made. Come in, Mrs Krantz. How do you do, folks. Nice to meet you, Mrs Hilmer. - Nice to meet you. Come. Sit down. That was a great idea. I'm really happy that you came. Look at all those books. I didn't even know you could read. Sit down. Well, what do you think of her? You lucky dog. So what's new, Melvin. I came to take your measurements. That was not funny, Melvin. She thinks I'm joking. Next Wednesday, we're going to elect Gus our new President. According to our laws, every President gets his brand-new coffin. I don't think that's funny either. Leave them alone. What do they know about real fun? Mr Hilmer, we came to ask you about that property you have for sale. You mean on Magnolia Road? The old house? No, I don't think I'll sell it. Then why do you have that sign: "For Sale"? Well, I changed my mind. Maybe I'll tear it down and build a new house myself. It's a large property. Well, if you change your mind again, we would be interested. For the kids, you know. I hope you like it. Don't worry about me, Mrs Hilmer. After 21 years of married life I eat everything. Even dog food. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please, quiet! So we can proceed with the ceremony. Why don't you get up? Oh, you are up. Excuse me. As I said before, gentlemen. I propose a toast to our newly-elected President. Mister Gus Hilmer. May the domestic ghost chase him to the end of his miserable life. May a black cat cross his path every day. May he wake up every morning under the watchful eye of a giant spider. May be spill salt every day. And have fights and quarrels with his lovely wife. May he break mirrors and get up on the wrong side of the bed every morning. May he .. - That's enough. Too much bad luck isn't good, either. Sit down. Gentlemen, I am very honored. Unfortunately, I can't drink tonight. I promised my lovely wife that I would come home .. Sober. So, let's drink to this promise of mine. [ Dance music: Loud ] [ Dance music: Loud ] Can't you turn it down? [ Dance music: Loud ] Close your window, at least. [ Dance music: Loud ] [ Dance music: Loud ] [ Dance music: Loud ] Are you out of your mind? I can't get you out of my mind. You will see what Gus has to say about this. That old idiot? I'll break his neck. You wouldn't say that. Let me go! - Never. Never. Remember that, never. Julie, I love you. Then prove it. Let me go. Would you like to have some black coffee, darling? No. Nothing, nothing. How about a pillow for your head? No. Please don't touch my head. Don't go away. Stay here. Tell the fish not to stare at me. [ Hammer noises ] Tell that sadist out there to stop hammering. There are customers waiting. Have him arrested for disturbing the peace. Oh. That Frankie, that no-good guy, he wouldn't come to say .. Goodbye to his dying boss. Say Gus, I've .. Got to tell you something. If it's about .. Frankie, I don't want to hear it. You are too sensitive. The boy is leaving in a few days, so .. Let him have his way. Thanks. I can manage. I always did before. So you didn't tell him yet? He's sick. The doctor is with him. I know. I've got to talk to you, Julie. Leave me alone. But you must listen to me. I said, leave me alone. I'm crazy about you Julie from the first time I saw you. I was desperate when you married this guy. It's too late now. No it isn't. Look, I'm not afraid. I'll tell him myself. Why don't you leave me alone. Please. Julie! I'm sorry it took so long but there were so many people. It's alright, Mrs Hilmer. I have only one other call to make and Mr Hilmer here is so much fun. I told the young man all about our marriage. The less you know about the dame you marry .. The better off you are. It's like the stock market. They call it over the counter. It's been sacrilegious how he talks about serious matters. I'm glad he's feeling better. How is he, doctor? Oh, it's really nothing serious. His heart is a little overworked. Now you take it easy for a few days and everything is going to work out fine. No excitement, no quarrels, no drinks, no nothing. I am afraid I have to find another doctor. Good day. - Good day, doctor. Good day he says, with all his prohibitions. Didn't you talk to Frankie a while ago? I think I heard you. Yes. He asked me how you were feeling. Let me tell you. He must be sorry that he gave me notice. Why don't you say something? What do you expect me to say? I'll say it if you want me to. You are a stubborn girl, Julie. Why don't you cooperate? I'll do my best. Mr Hilmer to see you. Oh sure. Come in, Gus. Come in. How are you, Eddie? I just passed by. I thought I would pay you a visit. I would like to talk over some things with you. That's a good idea. I need the business. It's pretty quiet now. Sit down, Gus. It's about my last Will. Oh, you want some changes? Well, I want to ask you a few questions and then I .. I would like to tell you some very confidential matters. Why, you've known me for so many years, Gus. It's part of my business to keep my mouth shut. Wait. I'll tell the girl to hold my calls. Go away. Don't worry. He's gone. I saw him drive off. I've got to talk to you. Why do you upset me? Julie, I got to tell you something. What do you want? I've made up my mind. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow and tell him. You're out of your mind. What do you want to do for heaven's sake? I want to take you away from him. But I don't want to. Of course you do. You're just a little afraid. I'm so confused I don't know what I want. Why don't you pack your things and go. Please. I can't. I'm in love with you. Yeah. You're in love with a lot of girls. Oh, you know better than that. It's just fooling around. How about that little brunette? That waitress. You're jealous. - I'm not! Julie. Alright, send him the dough but .. Now make all the necessary arrangements. That's alright. But please avoid his visit. Try to avoid it. You know I don't like .. I don't like to have him here. Not for the time being, at least. Yes, I know. I know. I know I can depend on you. Thank you. What is it? Something happened? No. What should have happened? I don't understand. Is something the matter? Yes, I'd like to tell you something. I talked to a guy last night. He is available, so .. Whenever it suits you .. Whenever it suits me, I can go, huh? It was your idea to quit. What did you expect me to do? Close my business? Well, you certainly didn't try too hard to talk me out of it. That teaches me. What are you talking about? I was always good to you. Fair, at least. What if .. what if I tell you I want to change my mind, Gus? I want to stay. I'd say .. No. I can't change my mind. Hi Frankie, what will it be? Let me have a double Scotch. Two more of the same. - Alright. Hi, Frankie. Oh, hi. - You didn't call me. I guess I didn't have time. Who is it now? Huh? I asked: who is the lucky one now? You think all I got on my mind is dames? What else? There's much more important things. Yes. I guess there are. Gus? Now listen. And don't be alarmed. He'll be here on the morning of the 7th. I'll pick him up at the station. No, no, no. Nobody will see us. I assure you. You'll give the key to the old house. I'll bring him there. And. Oh yes, that's a great idea, Eddie. But you must try to help me to get him out of town as quick as possible. Ha-ha. I wouldn't have thought of it. Thank you .. thank you, Eddie. Can I help you? - Oh. No. No, thank you. I'm looking for. You know, I have another .. Work jacket like this, and this here is torn a little bit so I am .. Oh, here it is. Where were you? In the back yard. Hey, I notice that you and Frankie are quite friendly now, huh? Didn't you ask me to cooperate? - Oh sure. You are a very clever girl. Clever and obedient, huh? Yup. You know that I was right? Now he asks me if he could stay. What do you say? Don't let him. It will be better when he's gone. Yeah .. I think so too. Julie. Can I have a little more coffee? It's delicious. Thank you, honey. You know, I think I should cut out that sweet stuff. I'm getting so heavy. You don't even listen to me. Of course I'm listening. Alright, I won't serve you anymore if you don't want. Yeah, but it's no good. Well .. Mind you .. you can't have everything. Do you think they like me? Ah, with fish you never know. Julie. Why don't you pack your things and go? Not a chance, baby. I got different plans. Don't worry. The guy has gone. I saw him go with his attorney to the old house. He goes there quite often. He's going to build a new one. The sly old fox. Planning to get you in that lonely spot and have you all to himself, huh? Well, he's going to be surprised. What do you mean? Nothing. I've got a surprise for you too, sweetheart. Yeah .. you have a lot of surprises for everybody. I saw you with that little waitress. She was crying. Ah .. she's crazy. Crazy about you, I guess. I love to see you with that jealous gleam in your eyes. Don't be ridiculous. Who's jealous? Hello? Hello, Eddie. Gus .. he's here. Don't worry. I told you. And listen. Be nice to him. He's afraid to face you. I feel sorry for him. Oh please. Don't be sentimental. No, I don't think so. I'll be there after dark. And please don't .. I need the book. I want to check the light situation, you know .. Julie! - Yes? Come here. I've got something for you. What do you want? - Come here. Look. The surprise I told you about. Remember? - What is this? I put an old car together. Specially for you. But I don't need it now. Well, I thought I'd refuse when Gus asked me to fix it so .. I felt sorry and I wanted to make it up to you. It's yours. Hop in. I'll show you how nice it runs. - But .. But where are you going? We'll be back in time. Don't worry. Where are we going? What is this? Don't worry. I want to show you where he's going to build the new house. But this is insane. He'll see us. Stop worrying. I know what I'm doing. Frankie, this doesn't make sense. You must be drunk. I was never more sober in my life. Why don't you drive back? What are we waiting for? I want to see him walk. No! Let me go! I want to get out of here. - Shut up! Oh no! Go ahead! Get going. What will you do? Give yourself up? You've got to give yourself up. I didn't do anything! Are you out of your mind? Weren't you with me in the car? But I didn't know what you were up to. I had nothing to do with it. You want to tell it to them? Who will believe you? Why did you do it? Oh, calm down. Look. If you'll be a good girl and everything will be alright. Just keep your nerve. Stop this. Hysterics won't help. Remember one thing. You're in this with me. What you do to me, you do to yourself. I don't care. I just want to tell the truth. Look, this is the truth. We both did it. We're both in this together. There is no way out. Whether you like it or not. You were mad. Why did you do it? Why? Julie, I love you. Baby, I'm no good, but everything I do, I do for you. To keep you for myself. Don't let me down. If you do what I tell you, it will all be alright. You'll see. We got to be careful, honey. People will be suspicious. We got to watch our every step. We got to know how to fool them. It won't be easy I know. Look, there are no witnesses. Remember one thing. We're in this together. Whatever you do, we're in this together. Why don't you get a little rest? Tomorrow you'll feel better. Don't feel sorry for him. He was no good, that chiseller. I know. I watched his operation for three years. They say he tortured his first wife to death. Somebody is coming. Julie, keep your nerve. Remember honey, I love you. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Mrs Hilmer? Yes. Who is it? It's me, Wagner, the Sheriff. I've got to talk to you. I'll be right there. I have to put my robe on. What is it, Sheriff? I'm sorry Mrs Hilmer to have to break the bad news but .. Yes? Your husband .. he was hit by a car. Run over. Is he .. dead? Hit and run. I hate to have to bring you such news. Believe me. We've notified all stations, all Highway Patrols. We'll need you .. To identify the body. It's still out there. We're waiting for the Coroner. "Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations." "Thou art our refuge and strength." "A very present help in trouble." "Grant us Thy blessing in this hour." "And enable us to put our trust in Thee." "That our spirits may grow calm and our hearts be comforted." "Lift our eyes beyond the shadows of earth." "And help us to see the light of eternity." "So may we find grace and strength for this .." "Jesus Christ our Lord." "Amen." "Our father who art in heaven." Easy, or I'll call a doctor. It will over soon, Julie. Just keep your nerve. You don't know. - I know it isn't over yet. Frank, I saw him. I saw him standing over there near the trees. Staring at me. Who? Gus. Who is it? Come in. Good day, Mrs Hilmer. Good evening, Sheriff. I hope you feel better. I feel alright. Why don't you sit down. Oh, I just have a few questions to ask you. Do you know by any chance, why Mr Hilmer went up to that old house on that night? No. I don't know. He often talked about tearing down the old house and building a new one. Did you know he went there that night? No. He didn't tell me. I just guessed it. Do you think somebody else besides you knew about it? I really don't know. Maybe .. - Evening, Sheriff. Ah, good evening. Any more news on that hit-and-run? Not a trace. We've notified all stations and all Highway Patrols. Nothing. Strange, because this particular road isn't used very much. The Highway is a better communication. Don't you know by any chance .. What Mr Hilmer was doing up there that night? And on foot? He never took the car on shorter trips. He liked to walk. Exercise. I see. There was a phone call right after it happened. It's changed the whole thing. The car in question just disappeared without a trace. It looks more like murder. Than hit-and-run. What do you mean, Sheriff? How do I know what I mean? I don't know myself what I'm talking about. Well, thanks. Excuse the intrusion. Goodnight, Sheriff. What's the matter, baby? I heard you scream. I saw him again out there. It's a hallucination. The guy is buried. You got to pull yourself together. Hey. Fix your hair. Make yourself pretty again. That will make you feel good. Stop your drinking. Miss Carter, seal up the bank statements, if you please. Yes, Mr Ferguson. I asked you to be present, Frank. Because Mr Hilmer was very fond of you. And after all, you are the closest friend of the family. The statements are complete, Mr Ferguson. The only thing missing is the deed and a copy you gave to Mr Hilmer's brother. He just arrived. Shall I send him in? In a minute. Ask him to wait. I'll call you. Alright, sir. It's a very unfortunate story. Your husband's twin brother David arrived just a few days ago. The day your poor husband was killed. He's been in prison for the last seven years and has just been released. A very nice man. I feel sorry for him. Your husband was much ashamed of the fact and kept the whole thing a secret. Which is understandable. David is here. If you don't mind, I'll call him in. Come in, Mr Hilmer. Meet your sister-in-law: Julia Hilmer. Mrs Hilmer. This is Frank. Your brother's right-hand man. Frank. Sit down, Mr Hilmer. Now we will proceed with the reading of the last Will. It was rewritten .. a short time ago. To be exact, August 17th. Here in my office. Signed by the late Gus Hilmer. And witnessed by my secretary and myself. Now, let me read the Will. "I, Gustav Hilmer, residing in the State Of California .." "Being of lawful age and sound mind and memory and not acting under duress .." "Menace, fraud or undue influence of any person whomsoever .." "Do make, publish and declare this, my last will and testament as follows:" "To wit." "I give, devise, and bequeath all of my estate .." "Both real and personal." "Of whatsoever nature, including my house and real property .." "My business .." "My stocks and bonds, my cash, money .." "And all other assets which I possess .." "To my wife, Julia." "And to my brother, David." "Who is presently incarcerated in San Quentin." "Each an undivided one-half interest." "Share, and share alike." How large is it? From the lamppost there .. To the corner .. that includes the house, of course. Quite a property. The house needs fixing. Tell me something, mister ..? - Dave. May I call you "Julia"? Gus used to call her "Julie". Well, of course that's more intimate. What did you want to ask me? Weren't you here a few nights ago? Yes, I wanted to see the house. I know I scared you. I heard you scream. You can't blame me. Where do you live now? In the old house. My brother insisted. Of course it's a horrible place. Even for somebody who came back from jail. Believe me. Maybe we could find a place for you in the house? What do you say, Mrs Hilmer? What's up there? That's occupied .. Frank lives there. I can get out. I quit anyway. Why should you quit? We won't close the gas station, will we Julie. You are my partner now. You have as much to say about it as I do. Let's run it as before. How about the room where Gus kept his files? It's very suitable if you clean it out. We'll think of something. Don't worry. I have almost nothing to move. Just a little suitcase. - Come. I'll drive you. You are all so nice to me. I'll be right back. If you don't mind. Ain't this something? And you thought I had hallucinations. It's like a nightmare. With him in the house it will be like living with a ghost. I'm afraid I won't be able to take it. [ Car horn ] We're closed today. In a few days you'll calm down. It will be okay. Who are you kidding? It can only be worse. They are so alike it is almost horrifying. They've got the same face. The same eyes .. the same voice. They even have the same hands. The same smile. What a joke. Step up ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. Let me introduce you to the Queen of our exquisite show. Lions, leopards and tigers .. Tremble in the their boots. Let me introduce to you .. The world's greatest lion-tamer. The glamorous .. Miranda! Notice the chair in her left hand. When she gets tired of the lion, she likes to sit down a while. You know there is a circus in town? I know. I saw the parade. What a dame. That lion-tamer. Hmm .. she could tame anything. I wouldn't mind. This is the first time I've been here since poor Gus died. What a shame. He was so much fun. I hear his brother moved in. What kind of a guy is he? The same .. exactly the same. Aren't you the undertaker? I think I saw you at the funeral. Oh you scared me. I didn't hear you come in. I'm sorry. I walk around scaring people. What do you want? Well, I felt so lonesome in my back room, so I .. Wanted to talk to somebody. Why don't you sit down? I'm just writing letters. Thank you. I wanted to ask you something. Of course .. I hate to bring up .. Disagreeable memories, but .. Tell me, how come you married my brother? I mean, where did you meet, and when? There is not much to tell. I was dancing with a travelling vaudeville show and he met me. And I wanted to get out of show business anyway. He was nice to me and kind and .. He married me. That's all. Uhuh. Did he ever mention .. me? No, but. He did behave quite mysteriously about some letters from San Quentin. Uhuh. Tell me. Did he know about .. You and Frank? What do you mean? What do I mean? I'm not blind. After all, everybody .. Must see right away that you two are .. How shall I say .. Emotionally involved. But on the contrary. Gus used to try to make us get along for his sake. Did he succeed? Don't be afraid of me. I have no special reasons to be loyal to my brother. It's true he left me a little fortune. To ease his bad conscience. He was not a good man. Believe me. He let me down when I needed him most. I don't feel sorry for him. And whoever killed him. I am sure. Had his good reasons. You think he was killed deliberately? Don't you? I talked to him that night, you know. Yeah. When he got killed. I even saw the car. And then I saw him fall to the ground. And afterwards when the .. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. You .. You are a little bit upset. Go ahead .. Finish your letter. I just saw that guy snooping around the junk yard. I was looking for you. He talked to me last night. What did he say? He knows .. about you and me. What did you tell him? - I denied it of course. Then he started talking about the car accident. He saw it happen, he said. And he tried to involve me. He said he didn't like Gus and whoever did it was right. Oh that's just a trap. To make you talk. I hope you didn't fall for a cheap trick like that. Don't be silly. I'm scared. I'm scared to death. Maybe you shouldn't be seen around here too much. Maybe you should pack your things and go away. No, that would really make him suspicious. He's smart. Those jailbirds really know their business. Look who's talking. Look, you cut that out. Remember, you're in this with me. That's what you want me to believe. But I can tell the truth and save my neck. Yeah? Well, it's a little too late for that, sweetheart. You waited too long. We're in this together. There's nothing you can do about it. So you might as well stick with me. Ah, come here. Hi, Frankie. You look gloomy. Let me have a beer. - That's a switch. How are things? If you hear about a good job, let me know, huh. You want to quit? Yeah, I heard the other guy was a pest. I can't remember who told me, though. I saw him the other day. He'll sure scare the daylights out of you. He looks like Gus Hilmer's ghost. Where is Anita? - She quit. Went home to her mother. The poor kid was upset about something. When did she leave? Two or three days ago. What will it be, lady? - Give me an Aquavit. I beg your pardon? Make it a beer. Thanks. Cigarette? No. No thanks, I don't smoke. Hey, wait a minute. I'm .. I'm looking for a strong guy. About your size. Are you available by any chance? I've got a job, ma'am. Sorry. You're sorry? Where do you work? Across the street. The gas station. Oh, what a waste. How much do you make? Enough. I'll pay you twice as much. Oh yeah. What for? An act. What kind of an act? A circus act. With me and two lions. I think you'd be .. just the right type. And you'd have a lot of fun, believe me. Well. Think it over. Yeah. And come to see the show. Just ask for the boss. - You're the boss? Yep. Bye, boys. Come to see the show. Frankie, that's your big chance. Grab it. Mr Ferguson left these papers. You both have to sign them. Uhuh. Come here. I think I've found out how my brother was killed. Oh yeah? It's a brilliant idea. You wouldn't believe what people can think of to get rid of a guy. What is it? Imagine that somebody .. Put together and old, broken-down car. He must have been a great mechanic. And then after the slaughter .. He took it apart again. No evidence. Not hit-and-run car. No nothing. Isn't that something? You don't believe me? I can read the question in your eyes. Who would be interested in Gus Hilmer's death? Now let me tell you something. As we are alone? The only person interested in my brother's death. Besides me. Would be .. My sister-in-law. What do you say? I'd say before you go round making accusations like that. You better be sure what you're talking about. Oh no. I wouldn't dare unless I was really sure. Besides that, my sister-in-law is not a mechanic, so .. That leaves me in the cold again. You're a very funny guy. Am I? You know, in jail they called me .. the joker. Ha. If I am in your way, I can eat in my room. No, it's alright. You're at home here as much as I am. Oh that's nice of you to say. Come, join me. No, I can't. This is for Frank. He's been working on that city truck until now. Ah, that was some job. I worked all afternoon on it. We ought to charge him double. Why don't you? It's alright with me. I'm dog tired. Say, have some cheese. Swiss. Imported. Wonderful. Take a piece. No thanks. I don't want to eat at your expense. What's the difference? It's always the same money. Yours. Julie's. Mine. It's my brother's money anyway. If he knew, he'd turn in his grave, the poor sucker. Ha! You certainly get a sadistic joy out of saying things. Oh, did I offend you? I didn't mean it. Look, mister .. - Dave. David. Look. Why don't you lay your cards on the table? What do you want from us? Nothing. Oh yeah? Well, I think I happen to know what you want. So, why do you ask me? You're inventing stories about us. You want to get us out of the way so you can grab the whole deal for yourself. To tell you the truth, I didn't think of it. But it's not a bad idea. Ha. You like to be very funny, yeah? - Hmm. I think I'm a .. frustrated comedian. If you have it all figured out, why not go to the Sheriff? Why don't you go and tell him your story, huh? Oh, I wouldn't do such a thing. I am grateful to whoever did it. My brother would have given me fifty bucks and some good advice. I would be on my way to nowhere. This way, I have a nice home. Some money to spend. All I need is .. Some friends who trust me. Well. I guess I can't have everything. I always overeat. I think I'll go for a walk. I'll be back soon. Hey, what's with you? You look like a ghost. This is not David. I don't get you. This is Gus. Don't you understand? You killed the wrong guy. His brother. What gives you that wild idea? Don't ask me. I know. How do you know? Look, your nerves are playing tricks on you. It don't make sense. I just know. I recognised him. Oh that's ridiculous. You also recognised Gus lying dead on Magnolia Road, didn't you? That's true. And he had his clothes on? You recognised them, didn't you? Yes, but. I remember he took things out of the closet that day and carried them away. Look, if it was the other guy that was killed .. How did he get out on the road? It doesn't make sense. Wait a minute. Gus had a scar here on his chest. I didn't know that. Oh what the heck. This is a crazy idea that .. You got to have some reason. He wiped the breadcrumbs from the table just a minute ago. Just the way Gus did. And fed them to the fish. Look, that could be coincidence. A lot of people do that. I'm sure you're wrong. I hope so. I .. I guess maybe you're right. My nerves are really in a bad shape. That's why you got to be careful. And go easy on your liquor. It's no good for you. Believe me. I know, but .. Don't you understand? Everything he's doing has one purpose. To break us down and make us talk. That's why you've got to watch out. Without evidence, without our confessions, he's got nothing. Any judge will take your word against the word of a criminal with his record. But one slip of the tongue, one false move and we're .. Wait. Excuse me, please. I saw. A little box of bicarbonate somewhere around here. You know .. my stomach is killing me. I shouldn't have eaten so much. I'll get it for you. Thank you. Thanks very much. You know that I spent almost two months in the prison ward. Under observation. They couldn't find a thing. No ulcer. No nothing. It must be a nervous stomach, you know. Oh, thank you. I hate that. Would you like to have some Bourbon? It always helps me. Thank you. I don't .. drink that stuff. How about some of that bubble-water? What's that? You know what I mean. Oh you mean .. soda water? Are you crazy? You want me to explode? That's the worst thing I could do. You know that once .. A nurse gave it to me in the hospital when I had cramps. The doctor almost fired her. It's poison. Say, I meant to ask you many times before but .. Why I was in jail? Forgery. Ah. Let's not talk about it. But my dear brother did much worse things. Only, he was clever about it. He kept the law always on his side. That's why he was so angry when it happened to me. For seven long years he never sent me a package. Not even a letter. That's why I learnt to hate him so much. That's why I came back. To get even with him. To make his life miserable. He thought of you in his Will, didn't he? Well, that's true. I almost couldn't believe it. Something must have snapped in his head. Maybe I should forgive him. But I sure don't feel sorry for him. I hope I'll sleep. Goodnight. I think you were right. I don't know. I really don't know. Hello .. is Mr Hilmer at home? Mr Hilmer .. Mr Ferguson to see you. Yeah, I'll be right there. - I've got some papers for you to sign. Why don't you come in? Hello. - Hi. What can I do for you? - Fill it up. Regular. So, you didn't come. Too busy? Yeah, I guess I've been kinda busy. Well, tonight is your last chance. We're leaving. After the second show. Oh, is business bad? Oh, it's a small town. What can you expect? Where you headed? - Mexico. And check the oil and the tires, please. You driving all the way? - Hmm. Alone. Want to drive with me? The job is still vacant. Or is that blond holding you? Where do you stay? At the circus. In my wagon. I can wait if you want me to. Julie. That's something. I really didn't expect that. Frankie! Come here. Listen, Julie. Imagine that Eddie Ferguson was appointed my parole officer. This call for a celebration. A customer there. [ Car horn ] Some ice cubes and here is fresh bottle. Now let's drink to my guest of honor. Eddie Ferguson. You must forgive me. I can't anymore. This is my fourth. I'm not used to drink. Ah, don't be a sissy. That's nothing. It won't hurt you. Julie, hand me your glass. I like to fill my glass when it's empty, not in between. So why don't you finish? Don't rush her. She's doing okay. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. That's my girl. How about you, Frankie? - No, I like to go slow. See, what a lazy bunch. What kind of a celebration is this? Now come on. Who doesn't drink to your health is a traitor. No, no, I really .. I don't want my children to see me in such a condition. Don't be silly. She will make us fresh coffee and you will feel like a daisy. Come, come, come. Drink up. Say, you're doing alright. I thought you said you couldn't drink that stuff. Yeah, I like to drink on special occasions like this one. Now let's drink .. let me see. To the Warden. That's a good idea. Oh he was so nice to me. He did so much for me. He wrote to my brother. Pleaded with him. I would like to send him a nice present. And his wife, too. Something .. special. What's his name? - Huh? What's his name? Why do you ask? Korfman. Henry Korfman. He is from German parents you know. You think you might know him? Just curious if you knew his name. That's all. Well, what do you mean? You think I would .. Forget the name of a Warden after seven years? Why should I .. Oh .. I understand. You suspect me? That I didn't serve time in San Quentin. You think that I'm just showing off, huh? A stupid idea .. did you ..? Oh no, look. That's a celebration? Eddie. Wake up. Let him sleep. Maybe he should lie down for a while. Maybe you are right. Eddie. Ha .. look at that. That's my parole officer. Too bad I haven't got a camera here. Come. Come and lie down here. It will do you good. You need to rest a little bit, then you get black coffee and we'll fix you up. Then you can go home. Okay? But Julie. You can't let me down. You must drink to the Warden's health. I want to write to him that we drank a toast to him. Okay? Say, would you show me those papers you got today? I've never seen such papers. Oh, I haven't got them. Ferguson took them to his office. Say, what is this? Just a little curious. That's all. First you ask me for the Warden's name, then you want to see the papers. The looks you are giving me. What's on your mind? Don't you know, Julie? Who knows what's on his mind. Hmm. Look at him. He thinks I drink too much. - You sure do. So what? If I get drunk, I can just go to bed. But you've got to be careful. You might have to drive someplace tonight. What are you talking about? You're drunk. Why don't you relax, Frankie? Have fun. It might be our last night together. Who knows? Why should it be your last night? Say, this is more like a wake than a celebration. Cut it out. Let's have fun. What is it, Frankie? Why do you stare at me, huh? I want to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. Go ahead. Ask whatever you want. When was the last time you seen each other, you and Gus? Oh, about twelve years. I lived in Detroit. You know, I had my business there. And you met the first time the evening he got killed, huh? Hmm. After dark .. in this old house. My brother wanted to keep the secret. There we stood. Facing each other after twelve years. At first I felt like forgetting the old grudge and giving him a brotherly hug. But he stood there like a judge. That crook. So we exchanged a few words. And then he started bargaining. He wanted to get me out of town you know. Then we watched ourselves in the mirror. To see it was amazing. Such likeness. You know, when I put on the clothes he brought for me .. And then he put his hair down the way I wear mine. Nobody in the world could tell us apart. We couldn't help laughing. And then he got the crazy idea to send me to a drugstore for a pint of liquor. Just to see if somebody would notice the difference, you know. Wait a minute. I don't get it. Who went for the liquor? He sent me. But then he changed his mind, I don't know why. So he went. And I stood there, watching him go. And then. I heard a noise. A motor noise, you know. But I couldn't see any car. All of a sudden out of the darkness, two headlights glared right into my eyes. I was blinded for a moment. But then, when the car turned around. I could see. A woman behind the wheel. - That's a lie. Can't you see she's drunk? She doesn't know what she's saying. Of course it's a lie. I had to use this little trick to get you out of your stubborn hiding. You don't trust me, huh? Still afraid of me? Oh .. What is it, Eddie? Don't you feel well? Come .. I think it will be good for you to feel a little fresh air. There is an easy chair on the porch. And. We'll get you a little black coffee. You'll be on the mend. You're out of your mind, you drunken fool! I told you to watch out. Now he leads you to it like a little baby. Don't shout at me. What do you care? You're on your way to Mexico. Yeah? We're on our way to the gas chamber! Oh, not me. There's no death penalty for withholding evidence. How about being an accomplice to murder? Shush. Not so loud. Somebody could hear you. The poor guy. He feels horrible. We must fix him up before he goes home. His kids will disinherit him. - Stop joking. What do you intend to do? Don't get excited. I knew it from the beginning and we've got along nicely. I was just hurt that you didn't trust me. What's your price? Hmm .. you want to bargain? Now let me see. You know that I have the same taste as my brother had. Say .. are you Gus? What? What did you say? I didn't get you. You heard me. Are you .. Gus? Oh. Now I can understand all the suspicious looks. It's an interesting idea. I like it. Well, are you? Maybe Gus sent his brother for that liquor after all? What do you think? How will you ever find out, huh? It's simple. Take off your coat. - Oh. You think you can tell by my shoulders? Never mind. Now take off your tie. And unbutton your shirt. Sheesh, it's like a striptease. I don't know what it's all about. As you wish. What now? To unbutton my shirt? Alright? Open your shirt and let me see your chest. Look who's here. Ah .. it's nice to see you, Sheriff. I am terribly sorry. You are almost too late to the party. There is nothing left. Only to clean up. Oh, I will be right with you. I have to finish a game here, with our little girl. What was it you wanted me to do? To show you my chest, huh? Alright. Never mind. The house is surrounded. Well, that's it. Let's go. You were so right, Gus. Every penny invested in a dame is lost. Maybe I should invest some more in you. How about getting you a good lawyer, huh? Goodbye, Gus. Hey, mister. Hey, do you hear me? Hello. What can I do for you? I'm looking for .. I'm sorry. I don't know his name. Your mechanic. He's not here. Oh. When will he be back? Well, I wouldn't wait for him. That's too bad. Can I help you? Yeah. I brought him a ticket to the last show. I'm there with the circus. You know. Oh, you're the lion-tamer. I heard about you. Say, I would like to see the show myself. Well .. be my guest. Thank you. Maybe I could see you afterwards, back stage, huh? Sure. Why not? Maybe we could have a late supper together, huh? That's a good idea. Where we can have a drink or two. 0r three .. or four. Bye .. I'll be seeing you. Well. Everybody has to go sometime. --(tg)--
