Yeeehaw. Aw shit. Billy, do you copy? This is Takashima. I'm under attack, repeat, I'm under attack. Shit! Billy, come in, this is Takashima, do you copy? I need help! I am Lt. Sirius Halud and I am Eujen. I have been selected to represent my people on the starship Nobility. And while I am certain these are not the heroes the Confederate Alliance is looking for, they may just be the ones humanity needs. Hail, brother. Alethes. Hello, it is good to hear from you. Are you on the ship yet, this Nobility? Not yet, I'm on the transport shuttle still. How do you feel about working under this Captain Cern? It will be an honor. I'm to serve with the rest of the crew as well. These people are serving aboard the flagship of the Confederate Alliance. Obviously the best stock humans have to offer, Eujin-like. Almost. We'll see how much like us they really are. Permission to come aboard. Danger, danger. Would you quit that? Quit, stop it, I'm sick of you! Sorry. Is, um, is that the computer? That's for me to know and you to find out. Ugh! What is that thing? Um, well, thank you. Have a nice day. Ma'am, there's a transmission for you. If it's that Eujin ambassador again, I'll... Endearingly say hello. Ambassador. This is the third time you've contacted us. I have told you, your liaison officer is docked and is presently on his way to report for duty. I'm presuming I'm not speaking with the captain because he went to meet our liaison officer in person? Of course. What could be more important than your officer? Wait! Aren't you supposed to be on the bridge? Right. Well. I'll let you carry on. Thank you. Ops, please inform the captain that the Eujin ambassador has contacted us yet again. Oh, and tell him to get his ass up here. I'm headin' to med bay. When I first heard about the arrival of a liaison officer to represent the 'jins, excuse me, the Eujin people, for this documentary I admit I was a little worried. I mean, tensions, as they are in the Confederate Alliance. How would the Captain react to him? Would he get along with the crew? I certainly didn't like the idea of him trying to convert the crew. Alright, you little flaming meteor from hell. I got your number. Thanks, sweetheart. Hm, ust like I like it. Ooh! And you are? (Video game makes (losing sound) I'm sorry, the, uh, lift was broken and I seem to have gotten lost looking for an alternate path to the, uh, the bridge. Oh, Hallud, Sirius Hallud, your new weapons and Eujins officer, sir. I usually only have that effect on the ladies. Welcome aboard, lieutenant. I'm sure everything's going to be fine. It's just a shame you didn't show up a couple of minutes earlier. The Eujin ambassador would have loved to see that grand entrance. Captain, I do apologize... Who cares? I'm sorry? Who cares? You're not the first person to see me from that angle. You're not going to be the last, who cares? I don't understand... Takashimi, get in here. Who is...? You been to medical yet? Um, no, not yet, I was going to... Yes, Captain? Take our new Eujin liaison officer to the medical bay for his routine scan. It's pretty safe to say he needs a guide. Should we not go over the ship's...? Bah, forms and formalities can wait. Right now, I really want you to get acquainted with the ship. Yes, sir, it is just that... Come to my quarters afterwards for dinner. We'll do the whole formal welcome aboard speech then, okay? - That would be wonderful. - Taka? - Come on, mate. - Good. - Right this way. - Dismissed. Yes, sir. Let's go. Oh, boss level. You are one ugly motha, ha! So you're our Eujin, huh? I don't know why it took them so long to send us one of y'all. Ever since you people joined the. Confederate Alliance you've been signing up to the Navy in droves. Well, it has taken some time to... Well, I better show you what's what. So, what this way is astrometrics. Over there is weapons control, that's gonna be your hangout. Over here is medical, straight ahead is computer core, and right around the corner is the crew quarters. If you really want to have some fun, right there is what we like to call the party room. Ah-ha! Party room? Yeah, it's a little nickname for the officers' lounge. Now you gotta be careful, because just last week. Mooney got mad at Johnny for kicking him out, so he rigged the entire thing to give an electroshock to whoever enters. Whooo, that is one man whom you don't want to stand between him and his whiskey, no sir. Who is this Mooney? Speak of the devil, hey, Mooney! How's my chief engineer? Hey, did you ever figure out how to make the sub-engine last on wine? Hydrobolic sacrosanctic. No, I'm good, thank you. You okay, Mooney? Good day so far? Okay, Mooney, I'll see you in the engineering room. It's all a conspiracy. Yeah, he don't talk too much. Come on, right this way. And finally, right over here is the one and only sick bay. Takashima, shut up. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. I'm male, sir. You must be our token Eujin. Yes, ma'am. Oh, I get it. Captain must have thought it would be funny, sticking you with us. Nothing I cannot handle, ma'am. Hm, perhaps having you on board might not be too terrible. Ooh, she likes you, I can tell. Doc, we got company. Bilhah? Hey, Taka. Doc, what in tarnation are you doing? Doctor Bilhah Barnum, at your service. Halud, Sirius. Taka. It's for you. Oh! Yes sir. Ma'am! Yes, ma'am. What happened to your uniform? Just right over, come on, there we go. So you'll be surprised just what an intestinal explosion will do to fabric. Subdermal communicator, you are now linked into the ship's network. The what? Don't worry, I graduated from Harvard at the top of my class. An Earth school, no less. I've never lost a patience. Have you had many? Sir, I've just been told, the captain wants you to meet him at this quarters after you're done here. How long should take take? Should be about an hour while he prods and pokes you. And then you get to go see the captain again! You lucky dog. Excuse me? For what? Oh, this is Dr. Allard. If you want your head examined, he is the shrink to speak. I think what Takashima is trying to say is that I'm the ship's psychiatrist. If you need any help at all. I'd be happy to set up an appointment. You know, I just love greeting new people. It's nice to meet you. Oh, it's nice to meet you too. And this new Eujin? I'm so looking forward to getting to know him. Well, I must be off now. To my meeting with Mr. Mooney. Oh and remember, I love you. So, here's hoping. Come on, come out wherever you are you little camper. Aah, die a bloody death! Captain, incoming message from HQ. Goddammit! What do you want? Admiral, sir. Careful, captain. Yes, sir. What is the status of your recent arrivals? As you can see we've got your cameras up and running. But I have to be honest, sir. I'm not sure about this whole documentary idea. We run the risk of exposing too much. Captain, you know how much we need this. What about your other new arrival? Lt. Halud? Switching to internal com. He's fine, I suppose. It's just going to take a little bit of time for the crew to get used to him. Good, the Eujins would have created a diplomatic incident if we did this and there was no one here to represent them. Agreed. Now I contacted you for a reason. I have a job for you, Captain. We've been receiving strange signals from Tyco sector of the Sol-Ort Cloud. I'm ordering you to investigate. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry? You're going to send the flagship of the fleet, the one that you're trying to show to all of Earthdom that the Confederate Alliance is not just a bunch of pencil-pushing bureaucrats with their heads up their...? On a milk run? Yes. Sir, I... It will be a tremendous opportunity to see how the crew reacts in front of the camera. Plus, you can break in that new weapons officer. Are you alright? I didn't think the Eujins were a compassionate type. The strength of the species depends on the health of the individual. The Captain and I, we've known each other since Academy days. This boss is going down! Ah, no smoke bombs! Captain? Yeah? You didn't call me last night. Oh, crap, I forgot, I was in a staff meeting. I'll get you dinner tonight, honey, promise. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Captain? Yes? HQ is waiting for your weekly report. Ah, yeah, thanks for reminding me, I'll get right on that. Ooh! We have a complex history. Wrong ass. Hm, pasta? Sure. Exercise in behavior modification. This is unacceptable. Are you disobeying a direct order? No, sir. Cern out. Alright, everyone, we're going to make a short supraliminal trip to the Sol-Ort Cloud. Hey, kid, you better watch out for this! Ah-ha! Taka, easy on him. Yes, sir. Taka. Sorry, sir. It's a little too hard to resist. Dammit. Mooney, check the cargo bay. Yep, he did it again. How did you do that? Taka turned down the relativity counter force just enough to give you a little jolt. The rest of us knew it was coming because we know what a cowboy. Taka is. Right. Captain, look! Taka! I'm on it! What the hell is that, Sirius? A sentry of some kind, sir. The hell is an armed sentry doing out here? Alert status. Alert status. Return fire! Yes, captain! Shield status?! Shields at 69%. How many are left?! You do not want to know. Alert status. Captain! Shit. Can we go around it? Looks like we're boxed in. If we stop or reverse course, I cannot guarantee the shields will hold. Mooney, prepare to fire the main cannon. Alert status. Cristination bipolar. Prepare to fire the main canon. Main canon powering up. I'm reading an instability. Will it harm the ship? I, I do not know. What the...?! Fire!
