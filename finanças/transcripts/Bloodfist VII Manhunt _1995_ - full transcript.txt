He was an asshole. - And he took a swing at you? - Yeah I mean the guy was a psycho. I mean I was just there to protect the girl. - Did he harm the girl? - Hell he probably raped her in some lot and them dumped the body somewhere I mean the guy was a real, he was a real? - Wacko. - Wacko. - Wacko. - Jeez you know that's not what the bar tender told us. (whacks) Now you listen to me a seed. If you don't want to spend about a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers.

You know I don't know if I like that son of a bitch more than I did Fletcher. - Aw now come on, Doyle's just in from the 77th he's just trying to be a hard ass and he's just trying to prove himself. - Marvosa. - Ya. - Come with me. - Don't you take any shit from him. - I don't take any shit form anybody Meadows you know that. So what the sisters have to say? - That Shara Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own. - So what, lot of girls left the bars with Ted Bunion that never stopped him from hacking 'em up. - Yeah but what was a Hollywood hair dresser doing some 60 miles away in some dire bar? - She's no hair dresser she's a fucking whore. Come on, she picks him up, takes him home. Fucks him, he kills her dumps her body he steals her car he busts into her house, that's when Wilson finds him. - Something else I don't understand. Why the hell was Wilson up in Hollywood in the first place last night. Find that out for me alright. - Excuse me captain. - What? - There's a guy waiting in the briefing room who wants to speak with you. - Who is it? - I don't know, RT says he's with the FBI. - FBI, what the fuck do the feds want? - Aw let's go cheese cake, checkout time was an hour ago, let's go.

That's the guy. - Can I help you? - Captain Doyle? - [Doyle] Yeah. - Special agent Craig, FBI. - That's detective Marvosa. - Hi. - [Craig] Hi. - What can I do for you? - Well your department called the bureau regarding some information on a Shara Williams. - Ah Shara Williams yeah, I heard nothing came up. - That's right nothing on her. But we did a little digging on Jim Trudell at the request of the sargent Zydowski? - Zydowski. - Zydowski, sorry. Jim Trudell, 31 years old, no priors. He's been working in the military for ten years. - Agent Craig we ran the ID. I could have told you that. - I don't think you understand. I don't mean he was shuffling papers in some office. I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments. Special forces, sabotage mostly until last year. He was brought out by espionage charges. Charges that were later dropped. He left he service and we lost track of him. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are you getting at? Are you telling me this guy has some sort of agenda down here? - I'm telling you the Breuer considers all threats very seriously. And as long as Jim Trudell is on the streets he is a clear threat to the public at large. - But if what you say is true why would he have killed two police officers? - Well that's the point you see, he's slipped up. But I'm sure if our departments work together we can get to the bottom of this. - Cooperate? - Every step of the way. - If you guys want in fine. Just remember this is my jurisdiction. Marvosa. - Captain we got a positive ID of Trudell about 15 minutes ago in Venice. - Okay guys we're back on the road again. Notify all units we're on our way, agent Craig you're my guest. - I'm right behind you. (dramatic music) - Ya it's Marvosa, get down to Venice.

I want everybody to play it cool till the time is right to make a move. Let's not pull any gang buster shit or we might loose this guy again. - Or worse we might have a hostage situation on our hands. - If you can trail him to a remote area, do it. We all want a piece of this guy but let's keep our heads and stay within the law, we've got people everywhere out here. - These crowds are gonna be a bitch sir. - I'm sure you can handle it, right now I wanna do an alley to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends form Mariner to 30th. Foot units you will continue on the board walk. That's it people, move out. - I'm gonna take the south end. - Fine. (dramatic music) - [Craig] Shall we?

(suspenseful music) (ringing) - [Marvosa] DT where are you? DT where are you, can anybody hear me? - [Jim] Is that you Marvosa? - Yeah who's this? - Trudell, I just got your number. - Fuck. (sirens) - Shit, what the hell is this. - It's a car jacking, he took the car. - What car? - Gray Mercedes Bendz, all jazzed up and shit, the guy's crazy. - Son of a bitch. - Did you get a license number? - No but it was a brand new van. - Which way'd he go? - That way. - That way, is he alone? - By himself. (sirens) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - This is 6815, we have a code 37 black Mercedes Benz I need an air unit right away, last seen around Shell court. (upbeat music) (clicking) (knocking) - Holy shit. - Hello Tubbs. Can I come in. - Yeah sure, come on in man, you scared the hell out of me. You know I thought I dreamt that phone call this morning. What the hell you been up to buddy? Dude you look like shit, are you okay? Jimmy you flipping out on me, what going on? - I don't know. - You don't know? - No. - Look Jimmy you know I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up on my door like you're on drugs or something the least you could do is tell me what the fuck going on. - Two cops are dead. - What? - I killed two cops. - Oh shit, shit, shit. Jimmy I don't know about this man, I mean are you sure? - Yeah I'm sure. - Jimmy do you realize what you've done that's like death penalty shit. - It was self defense Tubbs, they were dirty. I stumbled onto some auto theft ring they were involved in. You've gotta help me. - Alright, alright you saved my ass enough times, what do you want me to do? - I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff. - Shit what I have now made our set up look like tinker toys. I've been skipping through internal revenue records all day, I even got video strip poker. So where do you wanna start? - A girl named Shara Williams. - Captain Doyle did you read today's paper? - No Zydowski, I did not read today's paper, it will just irritate the hell out of me. - Well read this. - So? Something I don't know already? - Well it's just kind of a coincidence isn't it, Stan and Wilson both started in 83, both in area six, both in Vice? - Hey they found the Mercedes Trudell used in his getaway, it's in a parking lot in Venice. - Good, good we'll get it to the nearest station, hold it for prints. You coming? - Round trip or one way? (chuckles) - Where the hell is Marvosa? - He said he was searching out some lead. - Get his ass down to the garage. Some lead. (upbeat music) - What's up man, what's going on? What happened to DT? - DT got shit canned so did Droopy, the other two are dead. - Damn. Who's this fucking clown huh? - I don't know, I don't know where she got him I don't know where he comes from. He's very good, he given me a real pain in the ass, I could have hoped enough Mercedes today to make half a million bucks. I gotta get rid of this guy. - We will, we get rid of him like that. But you know what? This time you gotta pay you know what I'm saying? If you want the pros it's gonna cost ya. - It's gonna cost everybody if I get shut down, that's just the price of doing business. - What ever homes, it's gonna cost you 50 Gs. That's it, 50 Gs is it on or what? Hey homes, don't waste my time is it on or what ey? - You're on. - Starting to bug me man. - Not today man. - [Radio] 5813 report to Burtell tow n' pound lot 401 north Magnolia. - Hello, 5813. - [Radio] Please report to Burtell tow n' pound lot 401 north Magnolia right away. - I'm on my way. (engine rumbles) - So how do you know they can't catch ya on this thing. - I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's kind of a long story but I cloned the serial link up with the binary code scrambler, sent it through a network main frame. So if they do try to trace it it'll be to a pick and save on Peeko. - I knew I could count on you Tubbs. - Yeah well I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean. Bagel? - No thanks. - Okay county tax records are showing that a 601 Oxford court is owned by a Atlantic trust corporation with a PO box in Dc. Nothing here about a Shara Williams. - How about Marvosa and the others? - I'm gonna have to access the LAPD mainframe but we gotta be careful, that ones kinda tricky. So what happened to ya Jimmy, I figured you'd be in some far off place somewhere living life on the edge like the good old days. - I gave up all that, got tired of all the lies. They tried to stuff me in Levenworth to cover there asses on a botched assignment. Got so I couldn't tell who to trust. Somethings never change. - Yeah well no ones gonna cover your ass this time either. - So what else is new? - Yup. I got something here. Personal records here on Wilson, Stanton, Marvosa. Addresses, and phone numbers. Bingo, I'll cross reference them to see what we got. (suspenseful music) - Agent Craig, we got a call. (whirring) - So what do we got in there? - What don't we have in here? We have Cd player, radar detector, cell phone. Automatic weapons. - What is this? - Get away car, did you say cell phone Zydowski? - [Zydowski] Yeah. - Well that just may be out ticket. - What do you mean? - Maybe Jim Trudell called someone from the car. - He'd have to be pretty fucking stupid to do that, I mean he knows hat we're gonna find the car right? - Maybe but it would be even stupider not to check it out. - Marvosa why don't you get that information for us, call the phone company find out what calls were made on this extension over the past 48 hours. - You got it. - Well I guess it's safe to assume this guy has some sort of weapon on him. - Well he had quite the election to choose from. The question is who's his next target. - Marvosa. When did you join the force? - What? - When did you join the fore. You know the police force the place you work. - 1984, why what the fuck difference does that make? - Did you start out area six? - Yeah. - So you must have known Wilson and Stanton huh? - They worked Vice I seen 'em around. - Well don't you think that's a little odd? - What? - Well it's kind of a funny coincidence isn't it? - They had to start someplace. - Where did you start Mavosa? - Traffic. - [Man] Doyle. - Yeah? - We got some hacker accessing your personnel files of detectives Wilson and Stanton. Yours to Marvosa. - The fuck are you talking about? - Do we have an address. - Yeah. - Alright this could be or guy Trudell. Get a swat team on that building right away. Come on let's get down there and find out what the hell is going on. Craig you stay with Marvosa. - Hey, hey Jimmy check this out. Look Marvosa makes calls to their fax number over seas and this is Switzerland country code. - A bank? - I don't know maybe he's selling swis army knives, I can't access that but look at this. These are their local account records for Wilson and Marvosa. - Stealing cars is big business. - Yeah well they certainly ain't police salaries.

(gun shots) (engine rumbles) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Hi Jim. - Hands in the air please, FBI. - Understand there's a lot of people looking for you. I know how that feels. - Why did you set me up? - I didn't. I thought maybe you'd be smart enough just to leave everything alone, I left you the keys to the BMW. - Well you thought wrong and now I'm public enemy number one. You got something to say to that? - Yeah it was my life that was in danger not yours! - What the hell are you talking about? - I'm a witness. - A witness to what? - Six months ago a police officer was found dead in a hotel room. Charlie Fletcher. Blew his brains out. He didn't leave a note, maybe you heard about it. - No but I'm listening. - It wasn't a suicide he was killed by professionals. I was in the bathroom when it happened. - Well didn't these professionals figure he had a girl in his room? - Yeah they did. One girl. - Don't go yet. Not yet. - I'll be back. (dramatic music) Charlie Fletcher liked to move around a lot but he was a regular. And he always paid for the kink. I had to call another appointment and cancel, Fletcher wanted to party all night. And he made it worth my while. - Hey Marvosa, what he hell are you doing here man? - [Stephanie] But then I heard the front door open. And I heard voices. (gun fires) And a gun shot. - Listen don't kill me man, I didn't do it. Please don't kill me, listen I didn't do it. (gun fires) - [Marvosa] You been a bad boy, now you're a dead motherfucker. Sleeping with a 14 year old girl you bad boy. - [Stephanie] It seemed like I waited forever before coming out. And when I did. There they were. No struggle no commotion just dead. - [Jim] Then what you'd do? - [Stephanie] I just waned to get out, I grabbed my stuff up and then I found it. - [Jim] Found what? - [Stephanie] I noticed something behind the curtain. It seemed like Charlie liked to watch over and over again. I got it all on tape. That's when I met him. Told him what I had. The FBI set me up in a new place. The cops found me somehow so I ran. That's when I met you. - So what happened to the tape? - It's in a safe place. - So you know about Stanton, Wilson, and Marvosa. - Oh yeah, they were fancy and luxury cars and making sure the thefts weren't followed up on. - You found all this out and you didn't do anything? - Well I didn't go after them if that what you mean. They came to me. Once the detectives found that empty video camera in the motel room. - What? - Hi. Hi. - Sorry about this, I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to get in this deep. But money talks you know what I mean? (dramatic music) - You know you're crippled buddy was a brave man, it's to bad you killed him. - You son of a bitch! - Hey, hey, come on now, we still got work to do.

With time it's looking better and better everyday. - You alright? - I'll live. - Good cause I have several thousand questions that the two of you are gonna answer for me. - Great maybe this time you'll believe me. - Maybe I will.
