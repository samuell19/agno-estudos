Minus ten, nine, eight, seven-- - Ignition. - Main stage. Four, three... two, one, zero. And so Voyager II is now a part of history... rocketing into space from its launch pad here at Cape Kennedy... on this historic date, August 20, 1977. On board the space probe are photographic images of Earth... verbal greetings and a medley of musical compositions. Voyager II is our invitation... to other intelligent species in the universe: Please come and visit our planet Earth. As the Secretary General of the United Nations... an organization of 147 member states... who represent almost all of the human inhabitants of the planet Earth... I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet. Hello from the children of planet Earth. When I want you to hold me tight Whenever I want you All I have to do Is dream I can make you mine Taste your lips of wine Any time Night or day Only trouble is I'm dreaming my life away I want you so That I could die I love you so And that is why Whenever I want you All I have to do Is dream Dream, dream, dream Big ending. How are you doing, sweetie? Don't do this to yourself, Jenny. Go to sleep. - That's very good, General. - Mr.Director. Would you excuse me, please? - Sounds like Soviet space garbage. - The Molink people say no. - What does the Kremlin say? - They don't know from nothing. This is Delta Yankee, two miles and closing, locked on target. - Permission to launch. - Permission granted. Delta Yankee executing launch. Missiles away. Delta Yankee reports a hit, sir. No change in speed, but we've got another alteration of course. New estimated point of impact: Wisconsin, up by Chequamegon Bay. Get Mark Shermin. Tony takes a pass, Murray drives to the left and blows it! He's down. No harm, no foul. Call me back in 20 minutes, will ya? I'm-- Yes, sir. Sorry about that. What? Chequamegon Bay. Yes, sir. No problem. Goddamn. Scott? You're not Scott. Scott. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. As the Secretary General of the United Nations... an organization of 14 7 member states... who represent almost all of the human inhabitants of the planet Earth... I send greetings. Who is that handsome guy? God, what a day. Yeah. Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen. Look at this gorgeous car. And off we go. Don't worry. It's not gonna go off till the hammer's back. What we want to do is we want to squeeze... and squeeze. One more time. Not bad. Actually, you should probably steady with your other hand here. More accuracy probably this way. Yeah, come here. Don't be afraid. I mean you no harm. This is great. Yeah. Oh, boy, what a weird dream. Who are you? What do you want? We go. I can't get the engine started. Where? Which way? Left? Right? Here. You know where that place is? If this is California... and down here's Texas... that must be, like... Arizona, maybe? Want to be driven. Arizona, maybe. Ten minutes. - About that time, Mr.Shermin. - Oh, okay. - Coffee? - Yeah. Sergeant, can you get police bands on that thing? No problem. Why? I'm interested in anything weird. You know, freaky, bizarre. Hi there. I'm Major Bell. Hi. Mark Shermin. - Is it clean? - No radioactivity. No readings on bacteria. Are you attached to National Security? Not very. I just work for them. On loan, sort of like a library book. Actually, I'm with SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. So they're sending you guys out on meteorites now, huh? - Only when they change course. - Change course? Can they do that? This one did, so they tell me. Twice. Either that or some airhead over at NORAD... misread a glitch on his monitor. It also came down slower than suborbital speed... so naturally they decided to fire some missiles at it. What are they doing? - Trying to take a core sample. - Nobody authorized that. - It sounded hollow to me. - There's no such thing as a hollow-- - Jesus Christ! - You were about to say? Up and at 'em. This is station WDLU in Madison, Wisconsin... bringing you the 6:00 a.m. news. No, folks, all of you that saw that flash in the sky last night... it wasn't the end of the world and it wasn't a burning airliner. No, sir. According to the A.P. wire... one of the biggest meteorites to strike the planet Earth in 80 years... hit last night near Ashland, not far from Chequamegon Bay. So you folks who called in to say you saw a flying saucer land-- That's about you? You really are some kind of Martian or something, aren't you? What do you want here? What are you doing? What do you want with me? Where are you taking me? Why do you look so much like Scott? I can't get no Satisfaction That does it. Help! Crazy sons of bitches! What's the matter with you? Help me, please! - I'm being kidnapped! - I send greetings. What's going on here? I'm being kidnapped! Greetings. You better let her go, pal. I'll give you some greetings. How'd you do that? Those little gray jobs? Communications Central, this is Project Visitor, Chequamegon sighting. I have Mr.Shermin for you. The director's on the line. Shermin, what is it? I'll know more in a few hours. We're taking it out of here now, and I'm setting up a lab in Madison. This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting, appears to be hollow? No, not appears to be. It is hollow. I think the balloon has just gone up, sir. Do you have to keep that thing on your lap like that? Those things-- guns-- make me a little bit jumpy. Define "little bit jumpy." That's a little bit. Jumpy's like nervous, afraid. You know that word, "afraid"? Afraid. Yes. How much English do you understand? I understand greetings in 54 planet Earth languages. I understand... English language little bit. Nothing much in there. It's just a lot of junk. That's my wallet. That's my driver's license. That's me. My name, Jenny Hayden. Jenny Hayden. What do you want, anyway? Why did you come here? Oh, my God. I look like Scott. Yeah, you do. I look like Scott... so you do not be little bit jumpy. Listen, about those police calls, you did say "anything weird," right? You got something? Just picked up one from Ashland, happened sometime this morning. A guy named Heinmuller had a collision with an orange and black '77 Mustang. The gal who was driving claimed she was being kidnapped... but when Heinmuller went to help her, the guy she was with, the kidnapper... yelled "Greetings" and melted his lug wrench. Yelled "Greetings" and melted his lug wrench? Weird you want, weird you get. How do you melt a lug wrench? I just copy them down. I don't explain them. - Did anybody get a license number? - Yeah, Wisconsin plates. Papa-X-Ray-Victor-237. We're checking the owner through D.M.V. now. What the hell is that thing? A sort of an invitation, Major. You remember that package we sent up with the Voyager probe? There was a gold, anodized disk... with greetings from Earth in 54 different languages... complete with a nice, little speech from Kurt Waldheim: "To whom it may concern. Come and see us sometime." We're coming to a gas station. We're gonna need some gas, okay? Gas. Gas for the car. Fuel. Energy. I step on the gas, the car goes. I take my foot off, the car stops. - Understand? - No. I do not understand. How can car need energy so soon? I don't know. I'm just telling you this is the gas gauge. When that needle gets to "E," that's empty. No gas. - The car stops, period. - Okay. Get gas. - Here you go. - Take it easy. Take it easy. - Fill her up, unleaded. - Gas. Gotcha. Yeah, I know. I have to go to the bathroom. The ladies' room. The rest room. It's when a person has to-- The hell with it. Figure it out yourself. I'm going. "Women." Me. "Men." You. Understand? You can't get her out, huh? Gas. Well, I know just how she feels. Every goddamn place you go. Take it easy. Up yours. Let's go. Nothing of interest in here. You want to sign that for me, Miss Hayden? Kidnapped. What? What is... kidnapped? You want to know what kidnapped is? It's being dragged out of your house in the middle of the night... by some-- whatever you are... being forced to drive all night with a gun pointed in your side... not knowing where you're going or what's gonna happen to you when you get there. If you're gonna shoot me, go ahead... 'cause I'd rather be shot than go on being scared to death. Go ahead. I mean you no harm, Jenny Hayden. New music plays. Here's Ole Blue Eyes, Francis Albert. Start spreadin' the news I'm leavin' today I want to be a part of it New York, New York I'm sorry. I did awaken you. Do they sing a lot where you live? Yes, we sing. Do you ever get hungry? Empty here. Like a car needs gas. Yes. This body has a terrible emptiness. This is called hungry? Yeah, and when people get hungry, they have to eat food. Eat. Yes, we must do that. We will stop at food station. You have hungry too? I'm starving. I haven't eaten since-- Oh, my God! Look out! What are you doing? Okay? Okay? Are you crazy? You almost got us killed. You said you watched me. You said you knew the rules. I do know the rules. For your information, pal, that was a yellow light back there. I watched you very carefully. Red light stop, green light go... yellow light go very fast. - You better let me drive. - I will drive. Do you seriously expect me to tell the president... that an alien has landed... assumed the identity of a dead house painter... from Madison, Wisconsin... and is presently out tooling around the countryside... in a hopped-up, orange and black... 1977 Mustang? We have the following givens. Look. That man, Scott Hayden, died last April. He's dead and buried. That's verified. He has no brothers, no look-alike cousins. But still this morning at approximately 6:00-- All right, we have been through all of that. I'm gonna ask you now, how could it happen? We think it might be some kind of a cloning deal... replication of an entire organism from a single cell. - We found some of Scott Hayden's hair. - Is that possible? Can you clone a living organism from the hair of a dead man? Well, human hair consists of keratinized cells... although in order to determine whether replication is possible-- I asked you a question. You mean us, in our present state of technology? - Yes. - No. What the hell are we talking about? We're hypothesizing a technology that's 100,000 years ahead of us. We're the ancients, Mr.Fox. Ancients? Technologically, yes. We've just started. But even if you're right, I still have problems. His knowledge of English. Listen to this. I helped put this package together, you know. This was designed so that an intelligent species... could get a working knowledge of English... enough to get by, anyhow. A couple hundred word vocabulary, a rough idea of syntax. Think of what it would mean to talk to a being from a civilization like that. Think of what we could learn. Who represent almost all of the human inhabitants... of the planet Earth, I send greetings. Greetings! There. That's what he said to Heinmuller on the road. It is also what the cannibal said to the missionary... just before he ate him. The question in this case is... who is the missionary and who are the cannibals? When do you have to be there? What? In Arizona. When do you have to be there? Do you see this little star? Star? What star? Where? There. We call that the sun. When this little-- When the sun... appears mid-sky three more times... I must be at Arizona. You mean 12:00 noon three days from now? Yes. And what happens if you don't get there in time? Then they will go. - Without you? - Yes. What will you do then? Then I will die. Die? Understand? You look for food station. What? A deer. A dead deer. Dead deer. Why? People hunt them to eat for food. Do deer eat people? Do people eat people? No, of course not. What do you think we are? I think you are a very primitive species. What are you, softhearted? You cry when you saw Bambi? - Define Bambi. - Huh? He doesn't understand. He's not from around here. You don't speak any English, huh? Steer clear of that bozo. - Define bozo. - Jerk. From Denver here... it's south on Interstate 25. Then you pick up I-40 westbound at Albuquerque. Forget that deer for a second. I'm trying to show you something. Now, where exactly in Arizona... are you supposed to meet your friends? Here. West of Winslow. I see a little speck on the map, but there's... a crater? You're supposed to meet them where that meteor hit? Why do you do this? Better safe than sorry. In case something happens to me. There's one more thing. The credit card for the gas. - You know how that worked. - Why should something happen to you? Who knows? The way you drive, traveling with you could be detrimental to the health. That's... me and Scott on our honeymoon. A honeymoon is... what you call it when... two people first get married, and they... go off together after they've fallen in love. Define love. Love is-- It's when you care... more for someone else than you do for yourself. But it's not just that. It's when someone is... a part of you. And when they-- What? Scott is dead. He was killed in an accident. When someone you love... dies-- Oh, shit. Define shit. Don't say that. That's not a nice word. Don't mind him. He's just learning to speak English. He's got a hell of a start on it. Who's the deviled egg on white toast? - He is. - Right. And a Super Burger... two orders of fries... two choc malts... and two Dutch apple pie with whipped cream. Had a wedge of it myself. It's terrific. Enjoy. Well, dig in. Wait, no. That's your dessert. Eat that with a fork. This thing. Here, like this. But you eat that last. Sandwich first, dessert last. Why? I don't know. That's just how it's done. What's the matter? Dutch apple pie. Good. It's terrific. For a primitive species, we have our points. Anybody for Lincoln, Omaha or Chicago... the bus leaves in five minutes. Look... I got to go to the-- I'll be right back. Excuse me. - Is there a back way out of here? - Sure. Through the kitchen. Why? - That fellow I came in with? - Yeah? Could you give these things to him after the bus leaves? It's just a map, car keys and a credit card. - You sure, honey? - Yeah, I'm positive. Thanks. Hey, honey. I wouldn't go out through the back door right now. That friend of yours is out there in the parking lot. Thanks. Excuse me, miss. You strike me as a meat eater. I can fix you up with a nice haunch of venison... maybe even a shot of pork if you could-- That son of a bitch. Hey, what happened to the goddamn deer? She went there, to the woods. Okay, comedian. Bingo. You leave him alone. - Butt out, girlie. - He doesn't understand. He doesn't speak English. - So what? - Hey. Bingo. I'm gonna tear you loose from your hinges, boy. Pick up your garbage and get going. Oh, Jesus. Are you okay? I thought... guns make you little bit jumpy, Jenny Hayden. You make me a little bit jumpy. I thought I told you to stay away from those bozos. It's okay. I think I understand. It looks better that way. Thank you, Jenny Hayden. All part of our friendly service. - Are you okay, honey? - Yeah, I'm all right. I wanted to tell you that eastbound bus is about to go. Want me to hold it? No, thank you. Never mind. Thanks, but never mind. Good luck. I'm gonna get that bastard, Donnie Bob, right now. Look out! Take it easy! I'm gonna get that son of a bitch. It's their fault, the Mustang. - Son of a bitch hit me and took off. - Anybody get his number? No, but it shouldn't be hard to pick up. '77 Mustang with Wisconsin plates on it. That Mustang them state boys wanted? That was orange and black '77 with Wisconsin plates? Kick her in the ass. I think we got the bastard. Damn it, Sergeant. We've been here since 6:30 this afternoon. When can we leave? As soon as the federals say so and not one damn minute before. Everybody tells it pretty much the same way. She had every chance in the world to get away from him... but they left together with her driving. Does that sound like any kind of kidnapping you ever heard of? They spotted an orange and black Mustang, Wisconsin plates. - Going west near Big Springs. - Right. Scott and I met two winters ago up at Iron Mountain ice-skating. I had on this little tight skating outfit. I was showing off. He kept staring at me. One thing led to another. A few months later we were on our honeymoon. Honeymoon is nice? Oh, yeah, ours was beautiful. Define beautiful. Beautiful is... better than terrific... better than Dutch apple pie. The best. Gotta get a couple of hours sleep. Just a couple, okay? You're not to approach them. Keep them under surveillance till the feds arrive. What if they approach us? If you're in a life-threatening situation, defend yourselves. Otherwise, wait for the feds. They get the 6:00 news, and we get the shit end of the stick. - That's the way it is. - It doesn't have to be that way. I got a hunch this might develop into a life-threatening situation. We'd like a room for the night as far away from this as possible. Oh, boy, am I whipped. My mom always said there wasn't a thing wrong with the world... that a hot bath and a good night's sleep couldn't fix. What am I doing? I must be getting punchy. It's just that in that light you look so much like Scott. I wasn't thinking. - You said, "Your nose is different." - What? You said, "Your nose is different. He broke his twice, and there's something else. I don't know. Something spooky about your eyes." That's word for word. You remember everything you hear word for word? Everything I hear, everything I see. Everything I-- Everything this body feels. The tub. Thirty points apiece is what the questions are worth. Tell us about it. Final category is songwriters. Believe me, General. I know what went wrong. The x factor wasn't red. I never knew it could be like this. Nobody ever kissed me the way you do. - Nobody? - No. Nobody. Not even one? Out of all the men you've been kissed by? Well, that'll take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been? I wouldn't know. Can't you give me a rough estimate? Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you? I forgot to bring it. Then I guess you won't find out, will you? Hey, there, buddy! Are you in there? It's none of my business, but if that's your orange Mustang... there's a couple of cops trying to jiggle the lock. The bastards ran one on us! Papa-Charlie-Three! Suspects in orange Mustang are headed south on Big Spring bypass. We are in pursuit! He's got a gun. Papa-Charlie-Three! Suspects on I-80 proceeding northbound. Still in pursuit. I know it sounds impossible, but I have a couple of people that say... they saw him carrying her out of the burning wreckage. Then they just disappeared in the smoke. I've had the police check the entire area, and there are no bodies. Thanks. Anyway, I can only assume they're still alive, and they're probably headed west. I'm going down to Grand Junction, Colorado. The army is setting up some kind of a roadblock on I-70. I'm goin'. Move it out. You're wanted on the horn. Urgent. Hello? Oh, I've probably been cut off. Hello? Yeah, I was talking to the police. I'm not the police, Mrs.Hayden. My name is Mark Shermin. I'm with National Security. I understand you wanted to talk to somebody about kidnapping. That's why I'm calling. There's been a mistake. There hasn't been a kidnapping. We're worried about you, Mrs.Hayden. I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. I just wanted to clear it up. There hasn't been a kidnapping. Where are you talking from? I don't know. A truck stop somewhere. - Can I pick you up? I have questions. - Miss? Hold on a second. You lookin' for a fellow? About yea tall? Red, plaid shirt? Nice-looking? Have you seen him? He hitched a ride west with our night cook about half an hour ago. Thank you very much. I'm hanging up now. I've got to go. If you want to talk to me, call me in Madison in a few days. - I'm in the phone book. - Wait, Mrs.Hayden! Do you know who or what you were kidnapped by? He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Really, can't you just leave him alone? Hello? Damn it! I need a ride west fast! Hey, I'll take ya. Come on. Let's go. What's your line? - Line? - Work? What do you do when you're not hitchin' rides? Oh, I make maps. Make any money? I make maps. You don't get rich cookin' either. Believe me. I got a girl. She's gettin' ready to go to college this fall. Wife had to go back to nursing just to help me pay for it. Here. You want a smoke? Yep, my little baby. Says she wants to be a doctor. I don't know. Costs an arm and a leg to raise up kids these days. An arm and a leg? Bread, geetus, money and lots of it. You all right? You're not from around here, are ya? What the john? Some kind of roadblock, I guess. Roadblock, I guess. Better keep these people in line. They're starting to slip around the end. Yes, sir. Sergeant, you heard the man. Right away, sir. Get in line! Line up! Move to the right. Stay in line! All you pedestrians, line up! Move to the right and stay in line! Sir, would you put that dog on a leash, please? You gotta help me, okay? - Stop him! - After that car! Thank God. How did you get here? I hitched a ride with a cook. It is good to see you, Jenny Hayden. We got to get out of here. Come on. Wait! I have done something wrong? I wake up alone. You're gone. Not a word. Nothing. You were right. To be with me is not good for your health. You could have at least told me where you were going, said good-bye. Good-bye? Good-bye. You don't know what-- Teach me this. I don't know. It's a custom. It's... how you tell somebody that you miss them... that you wish them well... that you hope-- Her tooth's coming in. Can anyone have babies? Just women. I understand the reproductive process as you know it. As we know it? You have a baby? No babies. Why not? Scott and I wanted to have a baby. It just turned out I couldn't. I'm one of those lucky ladies that... just can't have one. Here's a blanket. It's dry. Better get out of those wet clothes. Better get warm. You know what pneumonia is? No? Well, you're gonna find out unless we get you dry in a hurry. Here. Put this on. Mr.Fox said he's been delayed getting out of Madison. He's gonna be late. What's going on? According to our best estimates, speed, course and trajectory... that object was headed for someplace in Arizona. Now Intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way here to make a rendezvous. Go on inside. Make yourself at home. Welcome to planet Earth. Where are we? I think we are coming to Winslow soon. Why didn't you wake me? I like to watch you sleep. I don't know why. It's strange. I think I am becoming a planet Earth person. You have to go back? Isn't there someway you could stay? I must go back. But there is something I must tell you. I gave you a baby tonight. That's impossible. I can't have a child. I've been to a doctor, a couple of them. Believe what I tell you. A boy baby. He will be human. A baby of your husband, but... also he will be my baby. He will know everything I know... and when he grows to manhood, he will be a teacher. If you do not want this baby, tell me now. I will stop it. Which is your star? Can you see it from here? Why? I want to show him where his father came from. There. Wait. There. Low in the sky. I see it. You'd better get dressed. We are coming to Winslow. I hope to God we're on the right train. I don't know. That looks awful big for Winslow, Arizona. Las Vegas. What? I think we've gone about 300 miles past Winslow. We're still gonna be okay. All we got to do is rent a car. With a little luck, we'll be back there before noon tomorrow. Just try not to be too conspicuous, okay? Come on. Half a million dollars, folks! Who's gonna take it home? Hit the giant jackpot and your troubles are over. Half a million dollars! Define giant jackpot. A giant jackpot is a lot of money. Money? Geetus? Bread? An arm and a leg? Where did you get that? We don't have time to fool around with the slot machines. We got to find a rent-a-car place-- Where's my wallet? - My wallet? - What is wrong? Where the hell is my wallet? - What are we gonna do now? - Is all right. You don't understand. No credit card, no money, no car. No car, we're never gonna get there on time. Is all right. Now. Damn. That's a handy little talent you got there, but you better spread it around. These guys get curious if you hit too many jackpots at once. Choppers from Air Cav will search the area on a quarter-mile grid. - Good. I'm glad you're here. - What the hell is this about? You're a man of some scientific attainment. You don't recognize an emergency autopsy room when you see one? - With leather tie straps? - You behave yourself, Mark. This your latest update? According to NORAD, his original course and rate of descent... would have taken him here, south of Winslow. - I see. Anything else? - The Cobra guys asked about ammunition. Helicopter attack units will carry live ammo at all times. - This is a combat mission. - Right. Listen, Mr.Fox, I'd like to be a team player... but there's something I want to call to your attention. One thing I don't need from you is a lecture on morality. All right. Okay. Screw morality. What the hell ever happened to good manners? We invited him here! - I don't have time for this. - I'm trying to make a point. So am I! Damn it! You make a great show of being a rebel, but the fact is this: You are a GS-11 public servant. Anytime that becomes too much of a burden... you can go back to Cornell or wherever the hell it was that we found you. Let's see you make it through on an instructor's salary. Now shape up or get out. Is that clear? There's been a possible sighting in Las Vegas. - They're probably headed this direction. - Establish a command post in Winslow. You'd better get out there... providing, of course, you still want to be a member of the team. You do, don't you? - Yes, sir. - All right then, get going. Get rid of that damn cigar. We ought to be coming to the crater anytime now. You're gonna make it. You're gonna go home. - You want to, don't you? - Yes, of course. What's it like up there? It is beautiful. Not like this, but it is beautiful. There is only one language, one law, one people. There is no war, no hunger. The strong do not victimize the helpless. We are very civilized, but we have lost something, I think. You are all so much alive, all so different. I will miss the cooks and the singing and the dancing... and the eating... and the other things. Mornin', folks. What'll you have? - Oh, coffee. - Dutch apple pie? - How about some nice cherry cobbler? - That'll be fine. - And whipped cream. - Comin' right up. How long does it take to get to the crater from here? Driving? Not long. Five, six minutes is all. I want you to try this cherry cobbler. And if you don't like it, you don't have to pay for it. - It's delicious. - My wife made it. Is very good. Do you have somebody... a wife, like... up there? I wish-- - I wish-- - What? Mornin', folks. Is that your Cadillac outside? All right, go ahead. Yeah, hold it. Yeah. I'd like to talk to these people alone. I'll be right outside if you need me. George Fox just called in on the radio. Said to say they're on their way over. I'm Mark Shermin. SETI? The Search For Extraterrestrial-- Mrs.Hayden, we talked on the phone. This is just such a-- Mind if I sit down? There's so many questions that I'd like to ask you. I hardly even know where to begin. Is there anything I can do for you? You can let him go. I can't. Really, I can't. I'm sorry. Is it-- - Are you supposed to meet someone here? - Yes. You don't understand. There isn't much time. Please. Why here? Why the crater? Have people from your world been here before? Before, yes. We are interested in your species. You mean, you're some kind of an anthropologist? Is that what you're doing here? Just checking us out? You are a strange species, not like any other. And you would be surprised how many there are. Intelligent but savage. Shall I tell you what I find beautiful about you? You are at your very best when things are worst. Let him go, Mr.Shermin, please. If he stays here, he'll die. Can't you see he's dying now? Thank you. Thank you. Wrong ones, huh? They sure as hell fit the description. No, the guy we're lookin' for is a lot older. Where are they? What have you done with them? Trooper, where are your prisoners? Wrong ones. We had to let 'em go. You what? Shermin, you are finished. I will have you eviscerated for this. Well, as much as I hate to stoop to symbolism-- I hear something. All units, this is Fox. I want warning fire only. When ready, roger that. I copy. Here we go. Mrs.Hayden, you and your companion must stop immediately. Stop where you are or we will open fire. I repeat. Stop where you are. We have orders to open fire. Last warning, Mrs.Hayden. You and your companion must stop immediately. We have orders to open fire. Last warning, Mrs.Hayden. For your own safety, you must stop where you are. What the hell is that? I must go. - Take me with you. - I cannot. - Please. - You will die there. - I don't think I care. - I care. Now... tell me again how to say good-bye. Kiss me... then tell me you love me. I love you. I'm never gonna see you again, am I? I love you. Tell the baby about me. I will. What should I do with this? The baby will know. Good-bye, Jenny Hayden. Good-bye.
