You remember that, don't ya? - I remember that, yeah. - Why'd she throw him out? Why'd she marry him and then throw him out? Why? - I don't know. All I know is, and it takes two people to be in love. It takes the lover and the beloved. But these two, they come from uh, different countries. And sometimes the, the beloved is the cause for all the, all the stored-up love that's layin' in the heart of the lover for such a long time. And every lover knows that deep, deep in his soul. He knows that his love is a lonely and solitary thing. (laughs) And the funny thing is, the object of that love can be anybody, and it just don't matter one whit. That's why, I guess most of us, we'd rather be the lover than the beloved. I mean, because the state of bein' beloved is intolerable. See, and then after awhile the beloved gets to hate the lover, because the lover's always tryin' to strip, strip, strip bare the beloved. See that's because the, the lover, (gentle music) he craves that love, even though he knows that that love can only 'cause him pain.
