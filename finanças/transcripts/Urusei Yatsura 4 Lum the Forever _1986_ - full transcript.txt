Well, then, Miss Lum, we'll leave the minor details for later... ...but please get started with the make-up and costume matching. Gotcha. But, man... ...if it keeps raining like this, we'll never be able to keep to our schedule! Hmh? Is that a short-circuit? Hey, get me a flashlight! What do you want? Megane... Idiot! Don't use the props unless you're told to! Numbskull! I... l'm sorry! I was only kidding around, see! Shut up! Sign: "Taian Securities" It's dark, so do be careful. Well then, I'll see you tomorrow, at school. Good night! Mom, we're home! URUSEl YATSURA 4 LUM THE FOREVER Good morning! Morning! Hey, hey, last night's blackout... ...wasn't that something?! Yeah. They said that Tomobiki was entirely out of power! I was watching a rented video that I had to return today... ...but, just when it was getting REAL good... Don't cry, man! C... C... C... C... ...Camera! C... C... Get the CAMERA, don't you understand me?! All right! Hey, Lum... Whatcha want? What's with them?! They've become my friends. What a loose woman you are! Whenever you go out, do you always get so friendly... ...with everything you see, regardless of whether they're people or animals?! They're adorable. Cut that out! Is... ls it really all right to use the movie film for this? Not to worry! I'll authorize it! Damn right! We must capture this on film right now. A second chance at a layout like this is simply too much to hope for! The soft sunshine... ...the petals of cherry blossom drifting like in a dream... ...the green-haired beauty, who plays with the birds in the wind... M... Miss Lum... Th... That moron! Good morning, Lum! Good morning! Oh, they're adorable! What's with these? They're my friends! Ran, long time no see! Wow! What's with you guys?! What the?! Ow! What did I do? Dammit! Huh? What? Uh-huh... Uh-huh... It's all right. Despite his looks, Darling is not that bad of a person! Ran, you can understand what they're saying?! You could say I understand them, but not in words. Oh, how should I put it... ..."intuition," I guess. It's like a melody without sound. But Lum and I used to be able to "hear" them more clearly... ...when we were little. Seems like we're losing touch, though. After all, Darling... Yes? ...we're seventeen already! The Principal... ...Mr. Kotatsu Neko... ...Mr. Kotatsu Neko... ...and Mr. Onsen... ...have now arrived! ...have now arrived! Please, stay as long as you like. I'm just so impressed by the magnificence of this cherry tree... It's almost scary. Yes. "Tarouzakura" will be three hundred years old this year... ...and, for the Mendou family, it's as if it's a guardian angel... ...the greatest of all the great trees, if you will. But it's withering rapidly inside... ...and I don't think it is likely that it will survive the coming winter. So tonight will probably be the last banquet for Tarouzakura. Then you really are going to cut down this cherry tree for the movie?! Yes. After we chop down the tree, we're thinking of reviving it... ...through grafting, to create a Tarouzakura the Second. Huh... S... S... S... S... Miss Sakura's party has now arrived! Lum, say ahh! Lum, say ahh! Ahh! What did you feed me?! Miss Sakura! Darling, hold it right there! Darling! Miss Sakura! What the?! Mi... Miss Sakura, who are these companions of yours? Oh, they were begging to come along... Apparently, they are on very familiar terms with your cherry tree. Uh, I see... But, at any rate, I apologize for arriving a little late. If we may, please allow us to join the party. P... Please, this way! What are you doing, Lum? I'm listening to a song. A song?! If you listen closely, you can hear it. What?! You can hear a song from a cherry tree?! How unbelievable! Since when... ...did they all start behaving like tame sheep? How could this become such an overly gentle scene... Is this really the same Town of Tomobiki... ...that I've lived in for the last seventeen years of my life?! The personal histories of each one of us... ...countless voiceless memories... ...blanket the city like dead plankton silently falling deep in the ocean. The pitch- black buildings, standing so high, are... ...like gravestones without caretakers. The gently fluttering streetlights are... ...they are... ...they're a flock of spirits, wandering aimlessly. And, just when you realize it... ...we're in midst of space, where all has become shooting stars... ...through which we travel at the speed of 3300 km/sec... ...the passengers of the S.S. Tomobiki. Amidst the infinitely vast galaxy... ...carrying along with us our daily lives that seem to repeat unwarily... ...the place we're now bound for is... It's starting to get windy. Come... I see... So that's why you're here in this town, eh. Oh, there ain't no reason for you to worry! This town is a good town! I tell ya, it's really a good town! Yeah, right! And maybe you can use these TVs here! If you want 'em, why don't ya take 'em? There ain't no reason for ya to worry! There's a ton of them lying around! Maybe these really work... Wh... What the?! Hey! I don't know! I wanna go home! M... Mama! Mama! In the year 1986... ...a group of students who came to camp by a lake... ...were attacked by a mysterious band of killers. The only survivor, a young man... ...wandered among the mountains for three days and nights... ...before reaching a certain isolated village. It was a village with bizarre customs, whose inhabitants lived as raccoons. Without warning, the drama draws us into the world of folktales... Say, are you sure this is OK as a pamphlet copy? It doesn't matter! All the trivial things are just McGuffins. Say what?! It means "Meaningless!" OK, let's get on with the show! That evening, the young man was put up... ...in the village elder's residence for the night. Then, late that night, it happened. Mister Tarouzakura! Mister Tarouzakura! It's been a long time! How is your illness? Very hard to bear, indeed! But I must keep on trying my best, or else... Yes, if you pass away now, who knows what will happen... ...with all the bad spirits that are attached to the villagers! But thanks to you, the elder is bedridden with a chronic illness! Oh, this is a tough problem! By the way, what is Miss Ubasugi of Mt. Hanaage doing? She is late as late can be! How inconsiderate of her! As soon as she gets here, we'll take her to task! My, my! I'm sorry that I'm late! How are you, Mister Tarouzakura? What took you so long, Miss Ubasugi? How terrible of you to arrive this late! Oh, forget it. Ubasugi hasn't shown any compassion for as long as I can remember! How can you say that to someone who came all this way to look in on you?! Want me to tell the world that hitting you... ...with a salted axe makes you un-revivable?! A salted axe? Cut! Well, Ataru, my friend. How should I put this? I must say "hats off" to your foul performance! Surely you're joking, Mister Director! This polished, opinionated, and cheap direction of yours... ...is just too good for the likes of me! No, don't move! It won't take long, so just hold still! Leave it to me! But if I prove that I can chop down this cherry tree... ...I must ask for an appropriate reward! Of course! Whatever you desire... Whatever you desire, we will give you! V... Very well! In that case... H... Hey, Mendou! Is your cherry tree a crab monster or something?! This... can't be happening! T... Timber! Ca... Ca... Camera... You ARE still rolling, right?! Uh, no, well... you see... we've had a power failure. For goodness sake, when will you be leaving? If you don't get it together, the food expenses will become significant! Huh? Blackout? Oh, brother! So long! Oh, hey, wait a second! Wait! Why in the world?! OK, let's get rolling! OK! The spell had been broken. The elder's illness was effectively gone... ...and everything seemed back to normal. But... ...the evil spirits that were attached to the villagers... ...revealed themselves, with vigor. It was a true nightmare, indeed. The villagers gathered at once, and prayed as one. Their prayers brought about a miracle. It was the advent of the Oni Princess. When the Holy Light of the Oni Princess enveloped the village... ...the evil spirits fled away, deep into the earth, never to resurface again. That night... ...there was a great celebration in the village. The villagers praised the powers of the Princess, and held a holy ceremony. CUT! CUT! What the hell?! Oh, give me a break! What the hell was he thinking?! What IS this?! What's going on here?! Ataru! You bastard! You have absolutely no idea how much of our blood, sweat, tears... ...and money have gone into this movie?! Eh?! How dare you destroy the highlight scene! This is unforgivable! Exactly! The reason I added this scenario, based on the Legend of the Oni Princess... ...that has been told for generations in the Mendou Family... ...was because I wanted to portray Lum's beauty in the final scene! And look what you've done! Oh, stop it already! "To err is human!" I wish to be human always! At any rate I NEVER had any interest in this nonsensical movie to start with! Allow me to be blunt with y'all! I quit! "NO... NONSENSICAL?!" For you, there's no such thing as the nostalgia for folklore... ...which should be deeply rooted in the consciousness of all Japanese people! Such sloppiness is what worsens the destruction and decay... ...in today's Japan! Well?! Don't you know that?! I don't even wanna know! Hey! Lum's acting strange! Mi... Miss Lum! Has something happened to you? Has something happened to you? Are you not feeling well? Oh... It... lt's nothing! I was just a little tired, that's all. All is well! All is well! All is well! All is well! What a strong wind! This isn't gonna help me! Still, man, where in the world has Kotatsu Neko gone to?! This is weird! Wow! Neophyte! Yeah, Darling, you're amazing! Come back anytime, once you've completed your training. Now, for the after-lunch workout... Oshiruko: Extremely sweet red-bean soup. ...so, Shinobu, you wanna go out for Oshiruko? Too bad... I'm on a diet! Then I'll rub your shoulders for you! No thanks! In that case, a total body massage! Darling! Darling! Hey, Shinobu! Hey! Hey, you don't mind, do you? POW! POW! POW! POW! POW! POW! POW! Oh, look folks... ...it's the secret technique: "Triangle Jump!" Darling! I... I didn't know he was that much of an idiot! But talk about skill! I can't stand it anymore! Here it comes! ULTRA ULTRA SUPER ULTRA SUPER ELECTRIC ULTRA SUPER ELECTRIC ATTACK! Lum! It looks like my body has built up antibodies against your electricity! The time has finally come for me... ...to put an end to this misery that has lasted for days without end! This... can't... be happening! There! There! Good! That's the way! GO! GO! What's the matter, idiot?! R... Ran... are you free this Sunday? Sunday? I don't know... you know? Uh, Umm... I have concert tickets... W... Would you like to? What should I... do?! Stop it! I'm ticklish! It's... It's no good after all. My electricity must be getting weak. But... why?! All right! All right! All right! All right! All right! Why, you! Where were you looking?! Wha?! W... What the?! Wow! Wait! Wait! Wait a sec! What's with these things?! What the hell's going on?! It's supposed to be April now, right? D... Darling, slow down, will ya? Darling! You know, it's been a while since we've gone shopping by ourselves... ...so there's no reason to rush! Don't you have any sense of shyness?! How many times have I told you not to hang all over me like that in public?! Ha! You're always all over other girls, Darling! That and this are different. Keep that in mind! That's not fair at all! You're selfish! Men are selfish beings! Oh! Darling! Walk more slowly! Darling, wait! What're you doing? Wouldn't it be faster for you to walk? Lately I've been out of condition... ...so I can't get up to speed... Oh! You can't get up to speed, you say? Uh-huh. Darling! South... South... ...heading west... Range, 20... Target in sight! Babe! H... Hey! Darling! Darling, you idiot! Lum! Lum! What're you doing here? Ten! Great timing! Help me find Darling! Did that idiot Ataru do something stupid again?! He's up to his usual tricks again! Hey, Lum... ...I don't know how many times I've told you this, but... ...for goodness sake, why don't you call it quits with that bozo?! Really, he's a completely hopeless loser! You and him are like... ...Moon and Snapper Turtle! ...Goldfish and Minnow! ...Sea Anemone and Worm! What the? Lum! What's wrong?! Did you eat something bad? It's nothing. Shutaro! Shinobu! Where are you going? Shinobu... Shutaro... "Shutaro... where are you going?" Wha! Mi... Miss Lum! What's wrong, Mendou? Uh, It's... lt's nothing! Forgive me, Miss Shinobu! M... Mendou! Wh... Wh... Wh... WHAT THE HELL?! It's freezing! Yeah! What's going on around here?! It's like it's back to winter again! Hey, hey, don't you think it's kinda weird? I mean, it's April now. Just the other day, the cicadas came out... ...and dragonflies started attacking people! Really, I wish they'd put themselves in our shoes! You don't suppose it's HIM again? The guy from Tomobiki High School... Moroboshi? Ataru? Maybe he's done something again! Maybe! Central Tomobiki! Central Tomobiki! Paper: " Strangeness in Tomobiki," " Abnormally Cold Weather," " Be Afraid, Citizens!" Paper: " Strangeness in Tomobiki," " Abnormally Cold Weather," " Be Afraid, Citizens!" I've run into her again. The beautiful Venus whose name I don't even know. The fragrance of her dark hair has wrecked my rationality... ...my love burns for her shimmering eyes... ...she's the true oasis in my barren heart! As the age of the desert now comes to an end... ...I shall become the greatest knight to guard the flower garden! But wait. I'm suddenly feeling irritatingly confused. I've never even exchanged words with her, and... ...I don't even know which high school she attends! But so what! We all meet each other for the first time as strangers! "Knowing is a momentary embarrassment..." "...not knowing is a lifetime embarrass- ment," as the saying goes! No matter how many people may laugh at me... ...l'll risk all I am to gather what little courage I have! THEN I'll seek her, and we'll take the first step toward a new life! Lower Tomobiki. Lower Tomobiki. My stop! This is my stop! So, today I catch a glimpse of her once again. My creampuff, whose name I don't even know. I wonder what things she likes? Does she dislike fermented soybeans or tofu? I've never even spoken to her before, but that doesn't matter at all. I'm burning with passion now! Ouch! Oh, th... this is my stop! This is my stop! Like yesterday, she's bicycling this way. My gentle breeze, whose name I don't even know. Each time, each time, we only pass each other by... ...but, today... today, I will... Good morning! Morning! Good morning! Morning! Numskull! Nincompoop! What do you idiots think you're doing?! We've pledged eternal love to Miss Lum. We're determined to look after only Miss Lum... only Miss Lum! And now this! How disgraceful! How dare you start the morning... ...by chasing after the butts of wenches you don't even know?! Look who's talking, you traitor! But what happened to us anyway? Until now, we've never been interested in any girl besides Lum. Oh? You're out of sorts, you say? That's right. Heh. It's unusual for you, but it can happen. My electric shock has gotten weak. And when I fly I can't go as fast as usual. Hmm... let me take a look. Well, you don't seem to have a fever. I can't pinpoint any abnormalities, but tell me... ...when did these symptoms surface? Maybe you know of something that might've triggered them. Come to think of it... ...while I was making that movie with Darling, Megane, and those guys... ...somehow I began to feel really scared. A movie? What kind of movie? I'm not sure... Stress must be the cause then. I'd suggest that you try to watch yourself for while. Now, this is truly an " Oni's summer sickness!" I just hope we don't have an earthquake or something. What the?! Yikes! Lt... lt's an earthquake! D... Don't you worry, Shinobu. I'm by your side! Ah! Mendou, I'm scared! Ah! Mendou, you're scary! S... S... S... Stop it! What the?! Lum... Huh? Shouldn't we go home pretty soon? Well... I wanna stay like this a little longer. Something's strange... It feels like I've left something somewhere and forgotten it. What?! Welcome! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Wh... What is this?! Lum! Lum! Lum! What's wrong, Lum?! Lum! Are you OK, Lum? I... I didn't know there were so many sounds. Lum... Hello? Why, it's you, Mendou! What do you want at this hour?! I need to talk to you about something very important! Come to my house right now! Understood! I'll be sure to make Ryoko happy! Who said you could have Ryoko?! What else is there for you to talk to me about? You'll find out when you get here! Huh?! We have come for you. Aha! ...and? Ataru, I doubt that you, with all the brains of a toilet slipper, can comprehend this... ...but there is something that rings a bell here, at least for me. Perhaps it is as Mendou says. Right now, we are witnessing some undeniably unusual phenomena. Tomobiki is showing its winter attire, right in the midst of spring... ...and the rocky mountain has demon- strated the gravity of the situation. Mother Nature's playing games. Happens all the time. Exactly... if it were that simple... ...by now I could be enjoying a peaceful sleep, cozied up in my warm bed. But in addition to the abnormal events in our town, there is Lum's loss of power. And there's the fact that our affection for Lum keeps on waning. Of course you get bored, you keep on going "Lum! Lum!" all year long! That's not true! When I first met Lum... ...I swore to the setting sun that my love for her had to be eternal! SOMETHING has begun working against us! Something dark, enormous, and ominous! Ah, what a bunch of rubbish! Mendou, I'm going home. Once home, I'm gonna brush my teeth, and hit the sack. Wait, Moroboshi. You can go home if you want... ...but before you leave, take a look at this! What... they're pictures from our class trip. Look closely! Look real close! It's not like there's anything unusual. Don't you get it?! Lum's disappeared from the pictures, don't you see?! Lt... It can't be! Ah! It's snowing! I'm thinking about keeping a diary, starting today. A pure white page... The scent of paper, when it's been opened for the first time. A new diary... In my heart, I want to search for as many words as there are falling snowflakes... ...and I want to try to keep on writing forever and ever. Darling... Looks like you've begun to understand at least a little! On with our discussion. After giving thought to various things, I realized something. Simply put, all the abnormal phenomena have come about... ...from that independent movie of ours! The independent movie? What relationship is there between this and that? That, I don't know yet. But, before we knew it... ...we might have triggered something that shouldn't have been. What? I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're saying anymore. Mendou... ...that scenario that you wrote... ...you said you based the ending on the "Legend of the Oni Princess," right? Uh-huh. ...so, what's the gist of that original legend? Well... ...as I recall, it was only told to me by my grandfather... ...when I was little, so I can't remember much about it... Your grandfather is still alive?! Follow me. Eh? An enclosed room, 1200 meters below ground?! Uh-huh. As you know, even though he is my grandfather... ...he's a slightly unusual person. One day, out of the blue, he said he was going to seek the Meaning of Life... ...and then he enclosed himself, and he hasn't come out since. Most likely, he's contemplating even as we speak. Talk about a weird old man! I forgot to tell you: Watch your step! What's the point in tellin' us that now?! What's the point in tellin' us that now?! Lum, I'm back! Te... Te... Ten, you're pretty late, aren't you? Yeah. It was getting cold, so I went up to the UFO to get changed. Oh, I see. Well, we've already finished eating... ...so I'll cook some ramen for you later on, OK? Sure... That'd be nice! Huh? Lum, whatcha got? Oh, this? This is nothing! No! No, I say! No! No, I say! Why! Can't you lemme see just a little?! NO! Lum! NO! When I say no, I mean NO! L... Lum! Lum, are you OK? Lum... L... Lum, y... your horns! Your horns! Your horns! L... Lum... Your horns... your horns... Your horns... your horns... Ten... Well, now... ...let us begin the Holy Tree Investigation, as Grandfather has told us to do. Ready, Moroboshi? Mendou... ...I want to go home right away... ...and dream about Ryoko and Miss Sakura in my comfy bed! Let's begin, Megane! Why do we men have to be staring at one another here... ...in the middle of the night?! L U M... Darling... Say, Lum, where are you going at this late hour? Darling? Hey, you! Can't you go any faster?! It's... lt's impossible in this fog, sir! Oh, just shut up and move it, will ya?! Yes sir! LUM! Oh, if it's Lum you want, she just stepped out. She seemed to be calling your name, I think. Our Dearest Shutaro! The opponents are now in the court! The opponents are now in the court! Just listen to that crowd, the uproar that rocks this moment in time! Here in these dark times that lack heroes, suddenly a superstar appears... ...a white, young noble, who rises out of the edge of nothingness... ...THE Mendou Shutaro! With an amazing record of 986 consecutive wins... ...he touches our souls with the energy of a newborn supernova... ...energy beyond even that of Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil!" Challenging him is the evil genius, rising from the most notorious slum... ...in the Tomobiki area, Block 113... ...Onsen Kid, alias " The Abominable Warthog!" The way he fights, using whatever... ...method necessary to win, no matter how low... ...reminds us on one hand of the ancient devil-king, that... ...rare aspirant to the title of Black Hole of Evil, Rasputin the monster monk! Meanwhile, Big Mama, who controls us with an intelligence... ...of 6,000,000,000 Olm... ...drifts serenely over West Fifth Avenue. For these two fighters, who're ready to explode at any moment... ...perhaps enough to cause a thermonuclear reaction... ...the world is holding its breath, eagerly awaiting... ...the belated beginning of this drama! Our Dearest Shutaro! You're wonderful! Wait! Hurry! This way, sir! Is anything wrong, sir? Uh, no... Are you exhausted, sir? It would be no surprise... ...since you're now a national hero, sir! What's my schedule like for today? Let's see... ...at 3 o'clock, there's a photo session for "Battle Magazine..." ...at 4 o'clock, you're doing autographs at the Union Department Store... ...at 5 o'clock, you're attending the Presidential Inauguration Party... Cancel them. Cancel them. What?! What?! I'm exhausted. What?! But that means causing the President a loss of face! It doesn't matter. I don't understand politics. Now, more than anything in the world, I thirst for love. Who is it? If it's insurance policies, stocks, or other door-to-door sales... ...I got enough already. Hmh? Y... You... ...Shutaro, it's you! I missed you! I also, Miss Sakura. I also, Miss Sakura. You're lying. If you aren't, then why haven't you called me even once?! Don't you understand? If I hear your voice at all, the ache in my heart only gets worse! Tonight, I won't let you go, Shutaro. Of a certainty. Today, I am all yours. Say, Shutaro... Just how long is it before my turn comes up? I don't want to keep living like this. I can't wait any longer. Moroboshi! Moroboshi! Yessir! Yes, yes, sir! When is my marriage to Miss Sakura scheduled for? Let's see... ...there seems to be a huge backlog... ...uh, Miss Sakura is number 33, so if all goes well, in about 3 years... Isn't there some way of moving me up? Oh, you've got to be kidding! If I do anything like that, the other women will be outraged! How inhibiting love can be! There's nothing I can do, then. No woman can go on not loving you. What's the matter, Shutaro? What's the matter, Shutaro? No... nothing, really. Come with me, Moroboshi. We've got to re-adjust my schedule! We've got to re-adjust my schedule! Oh, uh, yes, yes, sir. Really, this is more than I can take! Ever since his retirement announcement... ...we've been made to follow him around the clock! Don't complain. Don't complain. "You're the only one, our hero... "...the one who makes it possible for us to eat!" Oh, that's fantastic! The roof is open, so it's purely sunlit! Yoshi-yan, let's go for a shot! All right! Mendou Shutaro... ...will you love these women as your wives... ...and vow to love them 'til the day you die? I do. Sakura, Shinobu, Akina, Kyooko, Momoko, Yuki, Keiko, etc... ...do you vow to love him 'til the day you die? I do! In the name of God, I now name you man and wives... Congratulations! We were amazed that a mass wedding would follow your sudden retirement! Only you would do it this way! I didn't want to keep all the women I love waiting any longer. I understand you're off on your honeymoon, but... ...will you be all right? Your stamina, I mean?! Who do you think my Master is?! He's the Invincible Battle Champion! Moroboshi! Moroboshi! Yessir! Go after the woman with long, green hair... ...who just passed by the entrance. Huh? Even with this many beautiful women, you still aren't satisfied? Moroboshi... ...do you remember what I said to you the other day... ...that lately, my heart aches for reasons unknown to me?! I believe she is the person who can ease my pain. I'm counting on you, Moroboshi! I understand, Sir! Please leave it to me! OK, everyone! Look this way, please! Gate No. 7 in Block 58 will be closing shortly. Hurry up, please! Hurry up, please! Say... You... Lu... m! Our Dearest Shutaro! Please take care! Miss Lum! Please step aside! Excuse me! Please let me through! Miss Lum! Ouch! It was just a dream! Good morning. Oh, Shutaro. Come here for a second. There's something interesting for you to look at. Sure. What the! Th... The dream... The dream is frozen! W... What's going on?! This must be the end of the world! Dammit, nothing good ever happens in this town! Oh My God! Mendou, what's the meaning of all this? What's happened? Well, I don't have any details, but... ...for the time being, I have contacted everyone... ...and told them to head to school at once. As I thought, it seems that the " Legend of the Oni Princess" wasn't just a legend. The spell was broken, and some kind of power was released! Huh? Miss Shinobu? What's wrong, Miss Shinobu?! Are you all right, Miss Shinobu?! Miss Shinobu! How embarrassing of me to sigh that loud! I'm just like some old lady! My name is Miyake Shinobu... I'm on my way to buy some girls'comics... My mother tells me to stop reading fairy tales and grow up... But I'm not going to. I can't stop loving Mr. Yumeji or Mr. Kouji... An atelier in Paris... the hustle and bustle of Mont Parnasse... A fashionable, modern, stylish, coquettish Parisienne in the floral city. I have two people on my mind right now. One person runs around the town 365 days a year, and tries to talk to me. At first I thought he was really cheeky, but... ...isn't it strange... ...now that I'm used to him, I don't think I dislike him so much anymore. But I don't know for sure, even now. Miss! How would you like to go for some Oshiruko? Oh? You're busy, you say? In that case, some other time! You, Miss! Over there! What is he thinking anyway? The other person is someone that I run into once in a while on this street. I wonder if he's a student somewhere around here? He looks to be sleek and very intelligent. And when he smiles, his pure-white teeth shine so brightly! But somehow, I always end up looking away and running... Why? It's because my heart starts to pound, and I feel out of breath... ...as if all the oxygen in my body was evaporating! Maybe I'm... ...in love? Here. Are you all right, Miss Shinobu? Y... Yes... Mendou, look at that! I thought the fog was getting denser again, but THIS is what happened! Someone else's dream... Wh... What's the meaning of this? Oh, I don't know what's what anymore! Mendou, what kinda nonsense are you spouting? Have you gone mad?! Go home, you idiot! W... wait a second, please! Of course, this is nothing more than speculation on my part... ...but given all the strange phenomena that have occurred... ...in Tomobiki this past week or so, Lum's waning powers... ...and the frozen dreams that have appeared right before our eyes... ...I don't think it is wrong to say that these are due to some vast... ...external consciousness which we are incapable of comprehending! If I may throw in a few words to all of you... ...my friend Kota has been missing for the last three days or so... Does anyone know his whereabouts? But, still, Mendou... ...what you're saying is that it's because of Tomobiki... ...that the town itself is starting to have its own consciousness. I can't really buy that... Then, please, look at it this way: If we consider that the whole town of Tomobiki, including ourselves... ...forms a single living organism... ...then Lum is something extraterrestrial. In other words, she's a beautiful, foreign particle. Oh! In that case, so am I! A beautiful, foreign particle! Hmmm... But if we consider strength of consciousness, Lum's would be greater! Ataru! You bastard! What's happened to Lum?! L... Lum's disappeared! WHAT?! What did you summon me to a place like this for, Shuu?! Ton, do you remember... ...those old days when we used to play together? Yeah... those were great days. "The mountain where we chased rabbits..." "The river where we fished for small crucian carp..." Ton, my family, the House of Mendou... ...and yours, the House of Mizonokouji, are relatives. In fact, we're very friendly relatives. So? I don't have any grudge against your family... ...nor do I have any grudge against you personally. What are you trying to say, Shuu? Forgive me, Ton! W... What're you doing, Shuu?! Please don't say anything! Just die, Ton! It's for the good of Tomobiki! Wait a sec! Shutaro here! Don't hesitate! Go all out! Why this, all of a sudden?! Why?! Please stop! Mizonokouji Family No. 1 Control, come in! No. 1 Control, come in! So, it has begun! All roads have been closed. Today's battle zone has been declared to be all of the northern region... ...between Area 4 of Tomobiki Estrade, and Tomobiki Aqueduct. At each block, everyone is ordered to gather at 9:30 sharp... ...and the attack will begin at 10:00! Honey, where's Ataru? He's gone to school already. Oh. Oh, Mr. Moroboshi, good morning! I'm in D-Block, so please don't be too harsh on us! No, no, let's all do our best! Honey? Our next-door neighbor Mr. Hasegawa says he's in D-Block! I guess you can't help it when your parent-company is you-know-who! I guess you can't help it when your parent-company is you-know-who! Oh, shut up! Don't you know that every morning is a battlefield for housewives?! Why don't you stop the nonsense and just head out of here?! Yes, honey... It's about time... Moroboshi! Why aren't you carrying a gun?! I could never bring myself to participate in destructive activities! It's to rescue Lum! What ABOUT Lum? Ha! Besides, even if we start this proxy war and break down all the frozen dreams... ...even if each of us longs, from the bottom of our hearts, for... ...the return of Tomobiki, the way it used to be... ...and even if this town goes back to being the Tomobiki it used to be... ...there's still no guarantee that Lum will come back, is there? Then you want us to do nothing but suck our thumbs and watch?! I'm not saying "do nothing!" I'm going to... run! Who are you?! Who in the world are you?! I I am I am still I am still no I am still no more I am still no more than I am still no more than the I am still no more than the me I am still no more than the memo I am still no more than the memories I am still no more than the memories of I am still no more than the memories of this I am still no more than the memories of this to I am still no more than the memories of this town. "Memories?!" Let's play! Let's play! Let's play! MEN! What do you think this is?! This is my house! De... Dear... Are you all right? Oh, you're home? Dear! Sh... Shuu... What is it, Ton? Is... ls the fight... over? I... I don't know. I wanna go home! E... Enough! I've had enough of this! L... Let's go back to the world where we belong. To Tomobiki. To Tomobiki. To Tomobiki. Oh, look. It's beginning to get foggy. Oh, look. It's beginning to get foggy. So... it is... Fog... L... Lum... Oh, no! I've gotta go back! I've gotta go back, too. I've gotta go back, too. Me too! Me too!

I can keep on living with the memories alone. The The upper The upper world The upper world belongs The upper world belongs to The upper world belongs to all The upper world belongs to all of The upper world belongs to all of you. Wh... Whatchawant... Dammit! Cherry blossoms... Hey, it's Lum! The dreams are... breaking down! Lum... Moroboshi... Ataru, go, why don't you? And don't come back, hear! Ouch! And from now on, the days repeat on and on as usual, right? No, not necessarily. Huh? Even if the days go around, in a path of endlessly nearly concentric circles... ...as a whole, they should ultimately lead us to a new place. That means... Uh-huh. No one knows what lies ahead of us. How naive of me... ...to approve of you and Lum, even for a moment! "Mistakes must be corrected at once." DIE, Ataru! Dreams that the town has, eh... Darling!
