And trying to understand that is one of the great mysteries that we have. ROB MANNING: Over the centuries, Mars has been this enigmatic little red dot in the sky. It invigorated imaginations of millions of people. What could be going on in that distant land? STROUPE: The overall goal of the whole Mars program has been the question of: Did Mars ever actually have life? So, especially early on in the Mars missions, we were following the water. That's because, at least on Earth, everywhere that we find water... ...there's life. (screeching) And so the question is: Was there water on Mars? And what kind of water? And could that have helped sustain life? MANNING: So, in the mid '70s, the two Viking missions were kind of the epitome of exploration at the time. NASA sent two orbiters and two landers, which would give us a whole new perspective on Mars. SQUYRES: Uh-huh. Ah... Wow. Yeah, there's the good one. Wow. (exhales, chuckles) It's funny to have such intense memories associated with a bunch of 40-year-old pixels. (laughs) But I do, man. I remember the very first time I saw it. ♪ ♪ At the time of the Viking mission, I was a bang-it-with-a-hammer geologist. I would go out in the field, and I would do geologic fieldwork. Fascinating science, but what I found disappointing about it was that there weren't new places to discover. But then I started working with the images from the Viking orbiters, and I would look down on Mars using these pictures... ...and I had no idea what I was looking at, but the beauty of it was nobody did. This was seeing stuff nobody had ever seen before. And I knew that I was gonna do space exploration. MANNING: The two Viking orbiters, as they looked down on Mars, they saw... You know, that's strange. There could be signs of past water flowing. Was Mars once a green world with living things and-and blue oceans? SQUYRES: We'd go there ourselves if we could. But we can't. And I just knew from my training as a geologist that if we could get a rover down on the Martian surface and it could move around and travel and actually look close up at the rocks, we might find out the truth about Martian history. And so, starting in the mid '80s, I'd spent ten years writing proposals to NASA, but the proposals all failed. (laughs) And I was facing the unpleasant possibility that I had just wasted an entire decade of my career with nothing to show for it. ♪ ♪ MANNING: But then we pulled a team together at JPL. Could we actually put the rover that Steve Squyres imagined and use this landing system that we already designed? So we produced a proposal and presented that to NASA. SQUYRES: And we finally get the phone call... ...that made our dream come true. Well, I am indeed very, very happy that we're able to announce that we are returning to Mars-- this time in force-- with twins. The Mars twin rovers. SQUYRES: We named 'em Spirit and Opportunity. This was ten years of writing proposals that finally produced the result that I'd been dreaming of. But I think, if I had known at that time what an arduous path it was going to be from that point to actually get onto the surface of Mars, I wouldn't have felt quite as elated as I did. (indistinct chatter) MAN: If we could take our seat, I'd like to get started. TROSPER: Okay, I'm up here as the project engineer in order to make sure that the big picture fits together between the flight system and mission system. I'll briefly go over launch, cruise and EDL. Our whole objective was to build two autonomous solar-powered rovers that could survive 90 sols, three months on Mars. And we were really hoping that at least one of them would work. But we knew that if we don't get it right we're gonna miss our launch date. SQUYRES: Schedule for mission to Mars is literally driven by the alignment of the planets, and if you miss that launch window, the next one comes around... ...26 months later. MANNING: That's no time to design, develop and test two rovers and put them on two rockets. And the pressure on the team is really phenomenal. So we had to come up with an amazing team working around the clock to pull it off. BOYKINS: From a young age, I was into Star Trek. I wanted to be Geordi La Forge. Engineering, this is La Forge. Shut down power to all transporters. I'm on my way. BOYKINS: But I didn't really know what that job was. You know, I knew they were the "engineer," but I didn't know what that was. I just knew that I wanted to be the person that always fixed things. Building Spirit and Opportunity really started on just a whiteboard. Okay, we want to have a 90-day mission, and we want to find evidence of past water. Okay, what do we need to do that? And then this team of different engineers has to bring that rover to life. ASHITEY TREBI-OLLENNU: This was my first mission. And it was very exciting, you know, doing something that no one has done before. I grew up in Ghana, and when I was a kid, I was very fascinated by radio. And I also was curious-- are there people inside the radio? So, one day, I opened a radio, and I was disappointed to find there were no people in the radio. So that's my fascination with engineering. BOYKINS: For the rover design... ...it was a deliberate decision to make the characteristics humanlike. TREBI-OLLENNU: When you're a geologist and you're working in the field, you typically take the rock and then break it up to look inside of it. So the robot needs the robotic arm that has multiple instruments to take measurements and microscopic images. Like a Swiss Army knife. SQUYRES: Now, the resolution of the rovers' cameras is the exact equivalent of human 20/20 vision. So, all of a sudden, they start to look an awful lot like eyeballs. BOYKINS: And then the height of the rover was five foot two. That's the average height of a human being. So it would feel like, as the rover was driving, taking these images, that a human being was walking along the surface. ELLISON: It's just a box of wires, right? But you end up with this cute-ish-looking robot that has a face. TROSPER: So we had these amazing science instruments, but once you put all that stuff on the rover, the mass gets bigger. Then this is gonna be a big problem for landing on Mars. But then what I'm trying to look at is actually literally using six little bungee cords attached here to airbags. And the challenge here is that there's a lot of different ways to do this. A lot of different ways to do this. We don't know which one is the best, and we really only get one shot at it. TROSPER: So our landing system had these big airbags that inflated. And they would bounce it across the surface. MANNING: The biggest problem right off the bat-- we started doing the math for how much the Spirit and Opportunity were going to weigh, and will those airbags be able to handle that weight? So we started doing tests. -What the...? -This is just dandy. -This is not a problem. Yeah. -No, this is a... this is a good rock. -I like this rock. -Yes. TROSPER: And so we were trying out the airbags with the types of rocks we could encounter on Mars. We do the first big drop. (laughing): Huge gaping holes in these airbags get ripped by the rocks, and we're like, "Oh, this is not good. Not good at all." MANNING: The parachutes were another story altogether. MAN (over speaker): Three, two, one. MANNING: But we did those tests with this big rocket-shaped payload and dropped it out of the sky from a helicopter. First one, the parachute tore to shreds. (helicopter blades whirring) The second one... MAN: Oh! MANNING: ...was torn to shreds. And so we realized we didn't have a working parachute. Unfortunately, that chute that just exploded was the chute that we were planning on taking to Mars. Cut to the quick. You're in very, very serious trouble. What part of this gives you gas? Where are you concerned? PETE THEISINGER: There's a list of threats that these guys have come to me with, and I've added all those threats up. They go in the category of everything we can think of that can go wrong. I understand your concern... TROSPER: In the back of your mind, you're like, "This is a billion-dollar national asset. This could be a complete disaster." (machine whirring) MAN (over speaker): Okay, we're ready. Here we go. (vibrating, rattling) SQUYRES: So we built Spirit and Opportunity with the intention of them being identical twins. (laughing): And they kind of started out that way, but things diverged quickly. -(vibrating and rattling stop) -MAN: Okay, we're all clear. ELLISON: All the way through assembly and testing, it was always Spirit hitting some sort of test first and she would fail. (indistinct chatter) -We lost a bushing. -We lost a bushing? Look on… look on the deck. ELLISON: And along comes Opportunity. (laughing): Everybody... Okay. Three, two, one. -(whirring) -MAN: Oh. MAN 2: Ah! -Thank you. -(man whistles) ELLISON: And on every test, Opportunity came through with flying colors. So, even before they left this planet, Spirit was troublesome, Opportunity was Little Miss Perfect. BOYKINS: So, after so much time testing and building our rovers... ...now it's time to put Oppy on the ground. ♪ ♪ This is the very first time we breathe life into the rover. Move. Her first steps.

SQUYRES: But it was hard to say goodbye. I devoted 16 years of my life to these rovers. And then you put 'em on top of a rocket and you shoot 'em into space and you're never going to see 'em again. TROSPER: For Opportunity, I was out with my, uh, family, and we were watching from the same launchpad that my dad had launched his missions from. And he had since passed away. And he was the proudest dad anybody... anybody could ever have. It was just very emotional-- for me, for my mom, for my family-- to just see how he had encouraged and inspired me to do space exploration. (whooshing) BOYKINS: The travel time to Mars for both rovers was six and a half months. Spirit and Opportunity were only three weeks behind each other, so they're not super far apart in celestial terms. So we have a trajectory to Mars, and we want to make sure that we are following that road to Mars as we move along. It's like you're in Los Angeles and you want to hit a golf ball to hit a door handle at Buckingham Palace, and that's what we're trying to do. BOYKINS: We call it the quiescent period. Six and a half months of quiescent time, nothing going on. Well, that's not exactly true. (explosive booming) MANNING: We got hit by the largest series of solar flares that had ever been seen before. And we saw this big ejection of the sun's energies and particles racing toward our spacecraft. ♪ ♪ TREBI-OLLENNU: Throughout solar flares, the sun releases bursts of plasma.

SQUYRES: But at that time, two thirds of missions to Mars had failed. Mars was a spacecraft graveyard... (chuckles) when we flew. (whooshing) A few years before, NASA launched two missions to Mars, Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter. (explosion) Both failed. One burned up in the atmosphere. The other one crashed on the surface. BOYKINS: Mars Climate Orbiter-- it was a communication error. We were converting what was given to us in English-- we thought it was given to us in metric. And that's ridiculously embarrassing. Big news from outer space, ladies and gentlemen. Apparently now, scientists claim there is no intelligent life... -at NASA. Yeah. -(laughter) Couldn't find it.

At this time, we'd like to invite you to sit back and enjoy the landing. BOYKINS: So, entry, descent, landing. It's approximately 86 events where, if one thing goes wrong... (whooshing) ...we will lose the rovers. It's the scariest thing you can ever think of, because the communication time from the rover saying, "Hey, I'm doing this," to Earth is ten minutes. There is nothing you can do other than hope they'd survive. TROSPER: We call it the six minutes of terror... is the time from when the spacecraft enters the top of the Martian atmosphere until it does all the autonomous-- all on its own-- activities it needs to do to get safely landed on the ground. LEE (over radio): Atmospheric entry in... three, two, one. (whooshing) TROSPER: Everything is on the line in the six minutes of terror. LEE: The vehicle is now at the top of the Martian atmosphere. At the time of peak heating, the heat shield will be heated to temperatures upwards of 1600 degrees Celsius. (wind whistling) BOYKINS: Parachute opens. Slows you down more. LEE (over radio): Current velocity is 446 miles per hour. At this time, we expect the vehicle has gone subsonic. BOYKINS: You have this thing called the heat shield that's super hot, and you have to get rid of it. MANNING: But now the hard part begins. The lander has to rappel down on a 20-meter rope. BOYKINS: So now you have a parachute, you have this back shell, you have this lander. The airbags inflate. At 40 feet, the back shell fires retro-rockets, slows the rover down to zero miles per hour and then cuts the last cord. (quiet chatter) LEE (over radio): We won't see a signal at the moment.

But... this is a very acidic environment. Not a place where life could have developed. So, yes, there had been liquid water, but this wasn't water that you or I would want to drink.

And by the time the drive is done, we come back and we get the results of that and start planning again. I grew up in India. And when I was about seven years old, somebody gave me this book which was about space exploration, and I was just blown away. Did you see how close we get to that rock in the beginning? During the mission, I was pregnant with the twins. And so it was a different way for me to relate to the twin rovers. I thought about these two beings that are so connected and so similar and yet are going to have completely independent lives. The rovers have their own personality, and it's hard for me to pick which one of them is my favorite. Can't really pick one, you know. It's sort of like this twin thing.

And we start thinking we have maybe unlimited life on these rovers because the dust devils have really helped us out here. So let's go, let's hit the road, pedal to the metal, and go see Mars. SQUYRES: We got to sol 90 for both rovers, and we had fun. So we were doing rover drag races. I mean, the two rovers were competing with each other to see who could do the most meters on a given sol. With Spirit, we had this disappointment. Like, this landing site is not what we thought it would be. ♪ ♪ FRAEMAN: But Spirit looked off, and there were these hills rising in the distance which were named the Columbia Hills. And so, if there's any potential evidence of drinkable water, maybe we'll find it in them hills. And on the other side of the planet, our lucky rover Opportunity was on a whole nother adventure. NARRATOR: Opportunity rover diary. What we really need is more bedrock deeper down in the ground. The closest thing is that big crater off to the east, named Endurance. SQUYRES: The beautiful thing about a crater is that it's a time-ordered sequence of events with the old rocks at the bottom and younger and younger and younger and younger rocks piled on top. There's scientific gold down there. But we had never intended to drive a rover down such a steep slope. (whirs, beeps) ELLISON: It's very easy to kill a robot on another planet when you're in a place like Endurance. I would plan to drive as far down as we need to drive. FRAEMAN: The tension between scientists and engineers is the scientists are the ones who want to do the crazy thing. You know, "I want to drive at this 35-degree slope because that rock is so interesting," and the engineers are the ones who say, "No, no, that's not safe. You can't do that. This thing you want to do is completely bananas." Frankly, if we can't climb pretty reliably up these rocks, we're not going into this crater. STROUPE: So we built a big test bed with basically a full-scale model of the rover. MAN: Oh, little slippage here. STROUPE: We tried to simulate the geometry. We tried to simulate the soil. (indistinct chatter) TREBI-OLLENNU: You know, the first time you go to test bed and you just drive straight up, it comes straight down. (laughs) (groaning) STROUPE: So we inched our way down. Or I guess, you know, we should use metric. We centimetered our way down. (whirring, beeping) Very carefully planning the drive to keep Opportunity from getting into too much trouble. (quiet chatter) MAN: Did we clear it? STROUPE: So we came back in the next morning and looked at the images, and you could hear the gasp from different parts of the room. The surface around the side of the crater wasn't as grippy as we'd hoped it was, and she apparently started sliding down the hill... (buzzing) ...towards this giant boulder. (alarm beeping) ♪ ♪ STROUPE: But we have something called autonomy built into the rovers. We allow the rover to think for itself. Because the rover knows more about the situation on Mars than we do. STROUPE: So, when Opportunity went down into the crater... ...she noticed that she was sliding too much downhill and stopped just centimeters from the tip of her solar panel. That short of crashing into this giant rock. Which could've been mission-ending for Opportunity. We all had heart attacks, but her autonomy saved us. And we were so proud of our lucky rover. SQUYRES: With Opportunity, we had a big, big, big photo printed. It was a north-to-south strip that was acquired from orbit. And it showed Eagle Crater where we landed, Endurance Crater where Opportunity was, and we rolled it out on a table. Way, way down at the end, there was this big crater, you know, kilometers to the south, that we named Victoria Crater. ELLISON: And I know it's ridiculous to take a mission that was supposed to be three months and go, "So, we've got this crater. We think it'll maybe take two years to get there." But we did it anyway.

But the rover thought it was executing its plan as though it were all the way down here. VERMA: So, the entire day, Opportunity was just spinning its wheels in place and digging itself deeper and deeper and deeper. (beeping, whirring) ELLISON: There's no book that's, you know, "Chapter Four: Extracting Mars Rovers from Sand Dunes." So we built a copy of the sand dune at JPL, stuck her over it. TREBI-OLLENNU: From an engineering perspective, it was exciting... (chuckles) ...because we like... we-we like a challenge. So it's almost like quicksand. And we spent six weeks trying to learn how to extricate Opportunity. STROUPE: But the soil had no friction on it at all. It was almost like trying to drive through cake flour. ELLISON: The engineers decided the only chance is stick it in reverse and gun it. (whirring) But on Mars, it was getting worse. It looked like we were getting even deeper. This could be fatal. NARRATOR: Sol 483. Power has dropped substantially. At the moment, we're just keeping our nose above water. (whirring) ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Sol 484. Long-term drive options are now back. (cheering, applause) MANNING: We said, "Okay, let's be a little bit more conservative about our driving from here on out." (chuckles) And so we carefully drove south, and we finally eventually made it to Victoria Crater. SQUYRES: There was a group of us sitting around a table drinking margaritas at a party. And somebody came up with the idea, "Hey, let's have a bet." Picked up a cocktail napkin, and we all wrote down our names. And everybody had to put in 20 bucks. MANNING: We said, "Okay. Who believes that zero, one or two rovers are alive next year?" SQUYRES: We kept that same cocktail napkin, and we did it year after year after year after year. MANNING: And every year, Steve Squyres, the project's principal scientist, voted that both rovers would be dead in the next year. My logic being that someday I would eventually win, and when I did win, it would cheer me up at a time when I'd be feeling sad. (indistinct chatter) MANNING: I voted just the opposite-- that both rovers would still be alive. So, actually, I did pretty well through the years in these bets. (whirring) SQUYRES: At this point, Spirit, our kind of hardworking blue-collar rover, was exploring the Columbia Hills. But she had been having mechanical problems. And then the right front wheel failed. -The five-wheel, five-wheel drive. -MAN: Okay. STROUPE: Somebody said, "This is a lot like that grocery cart with the stuck wheel that's easier to pull than push." We're like, "Pull! Yes, let's go backwards." ELLISON: So, Spirit slowly drove backwards through Columbia Hills, dragging this broken wheel as it went. And it was awful because winter was coming. ♪ ♪ BOYKINS: So, a Martian winter is twice as long as it is on Earth. (shuddering): So it gets really cold. It gets so cold that you have to use much of your energy to keep all of your hardware above a certain temperature, or it's likely to break. SQUYRES: At the Spirit site, we desperately needed a way to tilt the solar arrays towards the sun. But the only way to do that was to tilt the entire vehicle. ♪ ♪ Spirit would have to climb backwards up this rocky, rugged terrain... ...to stay alive all through the winter. (beeping) And it's not just the seasons. You've also got things like dust storms. SQUYRES: Sometimes dust storms will blow up into a global storm. And this one hit Opportunity the hardest. -NARRATOR: Sol 1,226. -(thunder crashes) Opportunity has been fighting for her life. Mars took off its gloves and pounded the Opportunity site with record high levels of dust in the sky. ♪ ♪ (thunder crashes) STROUPE: So we had to tweak the rover's onboard decision-making process so that when the power started getting too low... ...Opportunity could shut herself down to preserve her batteries. (indistinct radio chatter) STROUPE: Nobody wanted to say out loud that we thought the mission could end at any moment. We could see the dust storm. We could track it from orbit. But it took weeks before it started to clear. The original time that was, uh, predicted for the data to come down was 12... 20:40 UTC, but we are a bit tight. So we actually had a lot of suggestions on morning wake-up songs today, so I thought I would just continue to play them as we get the data.

(song ends) (wind whistling softly) (cheering, applause) Thank you. -Dr. Squyres. -Nice to be here. -Thank you so much for joining us. -Yeah. Now, um, this is a model of one of the rovers that's on Mars right now. -That's right. -Which... Is this... Is this, uh, Spirit or Opportunity? SQUYRES: Uh, they're basically identical twins, -so they look the same. -So you can't tell the difference -between your two children. -Uh... You're a terrible father is what you're saying. -(laughs) -(audience laughing) Um... SQUYRES: So, Spirit and Opportunity's mission had kind of taken on a life of its own with the public. The traffic once again is heavy today on Mars. Rovers Spirit and Opportunity still at it. So far, they have traveled nine and a quarter miles and captured more than 156,000 images. SQUYRES: NASA does a lot of wonderful things in space science. But try to explain gamma-ray spectroscopy to an eight-year-old-- it's hard. But a robot geologist-- anybody could sort of understand what it was about. And now exploration and adventure can become a very large shared human experience. (whirring) MAN: What is he doing? MANNING: The rovers became a phenomenon. They represented exploration and curiosity and interest in the world. Godspeed to the Mars rover, wherever you are tonight. MANNING: And the more these rovers lasted and the more promise of future discovery... Elbow. Has a wrist. MANNING: ...people around the world were becoming really attached to these rovers. STROUPE: But I don't think any of us fully realized the impact that we were having on the public until Spirit got stuck. TROSPER: My alter ego, Spirit, had a problem. She already had a broken wheel, and she had gotten a little bit embedded. And then another wheel broke, and it was getting close to winter. (beeps, whirs) But I figured, knowing Spirit, that she'd figure it out. ♪ ♪ STROUPE: This mound of rocks, this may be what we're hung on right there. And both on Mars and in the test bed, as we drive, it does sink. This first slide here just is an overview of the energy requirements for Spirit. Um, the numbers in red are the ones where we won't have enough energy to survive for an extended period of time. STROUPE: So now it was really a race against the clock. We were making very slow progress, but we had to try and try to beat winter. And we started getting letters and phone calls from the public. This real sense of, you know, we have to do whatever it takes to save Spirit. VERMA: And the public called this campaign "Free Spirit." And it showed us that humans are capable of forming a connection and a bond to a robot. NARRATOR: Sol 2,196. Spirit has been prepared for her winter sleep. She is tucked into bed, and now we all watch carefully for the signal or lack thereof. BOYKINS: As the rover starts to get hypothermia, she can't communicate anymore. And then she either wakes up the next morning or she doesn't wake up at all. When the sun came back up, we'd listen, we try to hear a whisper, a tone. Anything. And we don't. It did feel like we were, you know, watching a friend go, in a lot of ways. I know people think it's weird 'cause I sound like I'm talking about a person, but even though she wasn't a person, it was still a huge part of all of our lives. TROSPER: Spirit was our rugged and adventurous rover, and her environment required more of her. And so maybe it's just because I was Spirit's mission manager and I wanted her to be like me, but... ...I feel like I connected with Spirit in that way. You know, maybe she was just a little tired, too, after all her hard work. ♪ ♪ SQUYRES: At any rate, if we can get something like a hundred meters out of today's drive, just project that line that you see... MANNING: So, by this time, only a handful of people who were on the design originally are still left on the team. So we're in another generation of engineers who are operating Opportunity. ♪ ♪ SIEGFRIEDT: Never in a million years did I think I would be able to work on Opportunity. When I was in eighth grade, I saw this news story of Spirit and Opportunity landing. I was just some small-town girl in the middle of nowhere in Texas. But I knew that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to help find life on other planets. MOOGEGA COOPER: When I was about 17, there was a naming contest for Spirit and Opportunity. (laughs) I ended up submitting the names Romulus and Remus. Their father was Mars, the god of war. I don't know what I was thinking, but... that is when my brain was completely turned on to Mars and space exploration... ...and eventually led me to NASA's Mars program. SIEGFRIEDT: When I first started at JPL, Opportunity was this older rover that was in her extended, extended times a thousand mission. (chuckles) But she is the reason I started aerospace engineering. I knew Opportunity was the place I wanted to start my career. All stations, this is your TDL. We will begin the downlink briefing in about five minutes. (beeping, whirring) SQUYRES: Now that Spirit's gone, there's this-- what do we do next with Opportunity? Do we just kind of noodle around till the wheels fall off? Or do we put our foot on the gas and just go as fast as we can and try to reach that big crater next? STROUPE: Miles and miles away, this huge crater called Endeavour. It would have the oldest rocks that Opportunity would've been able to look at so far. But it was many years away. And we might not make it, but it was where the next good stuff was, so we might as well try. NARRATOR: Sol 1,784. Opportunity has been trekking toward Endeavour Crater, driving as frequently and for as long as possible. This week, she won the reverse galactic lottery -and was struck by lightning. -(thunder cracks) Sort of. She got hit by a cosmic ray that stalled her for a few days. But she is okay and back to driving. Sol 2,042. Opportunity seems to have become a meteorite hunter. She has discovered three meteorites so far on her journey to Endeavour. Sol 2,213. -Oppy is in her fourth winter on Mars -(wind whistling) and the coldest yet. So, in order to save energy, the rover is sleeping more to keep her electronics warm. ELLISON: So we're sprinting and we're sprinting and we're sprinting. Some days getting great distance, some days not going very far at all, but we keep going. NARRATOR: Opportunity is only about two kilometers away from Endeavour Crater. She'll make landfall at Spirit Point, named in honor of Oppy's silent sister. ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the very first Mars Marathon here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (cheering, applause) The Opportunity rover has achieved a marathon's distance on Mars just a week and a half ago. (cheering) ANNOUNCER: Congratulations, everyone! BOYKINS: So, at this point, we have well exceeded our warranty and then the extended warranty and then the phone call on your phone that says, "Hey, we'll give you more warranty." We've run past that, too. ♪ ♪ (beeping) And Oppy started to show signs of age. Her gray hair was the dust accumulation in the crevices between the cables. STROUPE: One of the shoulder joints in Opportunity's arm started getting arthritis. We ended up realizing that if we keep trying to move it, it's gonna quit somewhere that we don't want it to be. VERMA: So we just kept the arm out in front of the rover for the rest of the mission. And with arthritis setting in, Opportunity also started to have problems with the right front wheel. So, when you were driving it, you had to think in terms of it always veering off and how you were gonna correct for that. SIEGFRIEDT: Once she started getting older and older, Oppy started losing her memory. She would go to sleep. (beeping) And she would essentially forget all of the science information and all of what she had done before she'd wake up. And around the same time that Opportunity started losing her memory... ...my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. And to see my own grandmother become not herself anymore... -A… -Bicycle. ...it was one of the hardest things to go through. ♪ ♪ And so when I started seeing Opportunity start slipping away, too... ...we had to figure out a way to operate in this new paradigm of her having amnesia. (whirring) And we did so successfully just by forcing her to stay awake. So she could send us earthlings all the data before she went to sleep and forgot everything she did. I think Opportunity helped me to really better deal with my grandmother's situation. And to... to understand that part of life. But she was still the perfect child. And she kept trying her damnedest to complete her mission, to find neutral water that can support life on Mars. ♪ ♪ FRAEMAN: After several years of travel, we finally started to see the rim of Endeavour Crater rise in the distance. ♪ ♪ ELLISON: And even though this thing is ten-plus miles wide... ...it wasn't till we pulled up right to the edge, and suddenly... ...whack! FRAEMAN: When Oppy reached the rim of Endeavour, everything changed. It almost felt like the start of a whole new mission. It was a whole new environment to explore, stepping back tens or hundreds of millions of years in time. (laughing): So I loved this part of the mission. NARRATOR: Sol 3,300. Opportunity is feverishly working to complete analysis of the rock Esperance, which may hold the clues to an ancient habitable environment. (whirring) (beeps) This is a clay that has been intensely altered by relatively neutral-pH water, representing the most favorable conditions for biology that Opportunity has encountered. This was a huge discovery. Water. Drinkable, neutral water once existed on the surface of Mars. ♪ ♪ And not only was there water, but it could possibly sustain ancient microbial life. So that is just revolutionary. SQUYRES: It showed us that the really ancient Mars was much more suitable for... the origin of life. MANNING: This was the Holy Grail. This is the reason we had gone to Mars. Oppy discovered Mars was a wet world very much like Earth. There were oceans. Water played a huge role in its early history. It completely altered the planet. SIEGFRIEDT: And Opportunity spent years exploring Endeavour Crater, making incredible discoveries that tell that story of water. So we could go back in time to a planet that might actually have had life. ♪ ♪ BOYKINS: A lot of people ask why I think it's important to explore Mars. And I think one of the things that will come out of Spirit and Opportunity's legacy is some of the answers to why. Mars had water. What happened to that water? And can we take the information and understand how that could happen here on Earth? And can we understand our part in that? Are we doing something that can accelerate... ...that change here on Earth? Because that's not something you recover from. ♪ ♪ (whirring) ELLISON: So we're 14 years into the mission, and sol 5,000 only comes along once. Like, it was a big landmark. We've got an aging rover. She's forgetful. She's arthritic. Cameras are still working. What can we do? I jokingly said a few days before sol 5,000, "We need to take a selfie." FRAEMAN: So, we'd been seeing Mars through Oppy's eyes... ...but we hadn't seen all of Oppy herself. Not since she left the planet in 2003. We've got a bit of data mining ahead of us. ELLISON: So, sol 5,000 planning comes along, and the science lead pipes up and says, "So, the engineering team "have this request. They'd like to take a selfie." And you could hear a pin drop, 'cause the entire science team is like, "Come again." We could be using up the remaining life of the robotic arm on this act of pure robotic vanity. STROUPE: We tried to sell this idea to the science team. But it's tricky because her shoulder was broken. So we had to figure out a way to get all of the different views of the rover without moving the shoulder. ELLISON: It wasn't great, but it was the best we could do. And I think it was almost the science team way of saying thank you to the engineering team. "This one's on us. Take the time to take a selfie. You deserve it." Like, "Let's have a look at this robot you've made dance for us." (whirring) (beeps, clicks) And so the engineers are taking pictures from 17 different angles... (beeps, clicks) ...based on the little preview picture of what they thought the microscope would be seeing. And with Opportunity's slow, old computer... ...it takes about a minute just to take a picture. We're like, "Refresh. There's nothing here yet. "Refresh. There's nothing here yet. Refresh." Bang, all the thumbnails showed up. Little, tiny, 64-pixel thumbnails. The images were kind of fuzzy and upside down. But then we run through it... ...and there's a picture of Opportunity. Yes, it was little and black and white and out of focus, but for the first time in, at that point, 14-plus years, we saw our rover. ♪ ♪ (quiet chatter) SIEGFRIEDT: Everybody who worked on Opportunity, we'd get these emails with our Mars weather data for the day.
