BUT I LIKE TO CUT A RUG NOW AND AGAIN. I'VE SORT OF BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. SANTA TOLD ME TO EXPECT SOMEONE SPECIAL TODAY. SORRY. THUMBSUCKING IS A TERRIBLE HABIT. I TRY TO ONLY DO IT WHEN I'VE SMASHED MY THUMB WITH A HAMMER. THIS IS MY WORKBENCH. I SIT HERE YEAR ROUND, MAKING TOYS. THAT'S MY JOB. I LOVE IT. I USED TO WORK OVER THERE... IN THE PAJAMAS DEPARTMENT. BUT IT WASN'T REALLY FOR ME. EVEN THOUGH LOTS OF KIDS GET PAJAMAS FOR CHRISTMAS... I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SNEAKING SUSPICION THEY LIKE TOYS BETTER. AND NOW, I HAVE PROOF. TAKE A LOOK. IF YOU TAKE THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN PAJAMAS, DIVIDED BY THE TIME SPENT PLAYING WITH TOYS... MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF TOYS PER CHILD... THEN TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE HYPOTENUSE OF THE FUN FACTOR... THROW IN NEWTON'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY, DIVIDE BY PI... WAIT A MINUTE... DIVIDE BY THREE? OH, NO, NO... THAT'S NOT RIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE, I DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE YOU... YOU KNOW WHAT BOYS AND GIRLS LIKE. AFTER ALL, YOU ARE BOYS AND GIRLS. SANTA STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE ME. BUT I KNOW. SEE, I'VE SORTA GOT A KNACK FOR GIFTS. YEP, I'VE SEEN EVERY KIND OF CHRISTMAS GIFT THERE IS. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE LEARNED ONE THING FOR SURE. THE BEST GIFTS OF ALL AREN'T ALWAYS THE KIND YOU BUY. IT'S THE KIND THAT COME FROM YOUR HEART. WHAT'S THAT? YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? YOU STILL THINK TOYS ARE BETTER? TELL YOU WHAT... LET ME FINISH THIS TRUCK, AND THEN I TELL YOU A STORY... THAT JUST MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND. OKAY? OH, BOY! LITTLE JOHNNY'S GONNA LOVE THIS ONE... IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. ( whistling "Jingle Bells" ) ( "Jingle Bells" plays ) THERE...THAT'S DONE. NOW, WHERE WAS I? OH, YES... MY STORY. THERE ONCE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FAMILY WHO LIVED IN A LITTLE HOUSE ON A LITTLE FARM... WAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY. LIKE ALL FARM FAMILIES, THESE FOLKS WORKED HARD. BUT THEY HAD A FEW BAD YEARS. NOT ENOUGH RAIN, THEN TOO MUCH. THEY HAD TO BORROW A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE BANK. OH, THEY WERE PAYING IT BACK, SLOWLY BUT SURELY... BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT OVER FOR MORE THAN THE BASICS. NOW CHRISTMAS WAS COMING, AND IT LOOKED LIKE A PRETTY LEAN ONE THIS YEAR. ( sings "Jingle Bells" melody ) WHEW! IT'S A COLD ONE OUT THERE TODAY. GOODNESS, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ALL DAY LONG. OH, IT'S WORTH IT. GOTTA KEEP YOU IN THE LATEST FASHIONS. YOU MUST BE REFERRING TO MY EVENING GLOVES. I'D OFFER YOU CHAMPAGNE, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR COCOA. WHY DON'T YOU WARM UP THERE BY THE FIRE? DON'T MIND IF I DO. WHERE ARE THE KIDS? DON'T TELL ME THEY'RE PLAYING OUTSIDE ON A DAY LIKE TODAY? NO, THEY'RE NOT PLAYING, THEY WENT TO GET THE TREE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GET THE SPIRIT TO GO OUT AND GET A CHRISTMAS TREE. I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH OF A HOLIDAY FOR THEM. WE'LL MANAGE. WE ALWAYS DO. AND YOU KNOW TOMMY AND BETH, THERE'S NO KEEPING THEM DOWN. ( kids laughing ) ( Jingles: ) MOM WAS SURE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. YOU'D HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING TWO HAPPIER KIDS THAN TOMMY AND BETH.

WE DID, BUT SOMEONE'S BEEN EATING IT. IT NEEDS SALT. OKAY, CHEDDAR, JUST FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO STRING IT. LET'S GO. ( Cheddar laughing ) ( moaning ) I GUESS THAT WILL HAVE TO DO. WE COULD STRING THE LAST OF THE CRANBERRIES. ( together ) YEAH! BUT I WAS SAVING THEM TO MAKE CRANBERRY SAUCE FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER. ( together ) CRANBERRY SAUCE, MMM! I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY THAT. COME ON, DAD, HELP US OUT HERE. YOU KIDS ARE DOING JUST FINE WITHOUT ME. HERE! WELL, OKAY. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE EXCITED DECORATING THE CHRISTMAS TREE. AH, YEAH, WHEN I WAS A KID I WAS PRETTY CRAZY ABOUT IT. ( chuckles ) YOUR FATHER USED TO GO OUT IN JULY AND CUT DOWN A TREE... SNEAK IT INTO HIS ROOM AND DECORATE IT JUST FOR HIMSELF. NOW, HONEY. YOU DID SO. YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME. REALLY, DAD? Father: NOTHING WRONG WITH A LITTLE CHRISTMAS IN JULY, IS THERE? Beth: I BET YOU HAD SOME GREAT CHRISTMASES WHEN YOU WERE A KID. MY FOLKS DID KNOW HOW TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. MOST MORNINGS WE GET UP EARLY AND GO FOR A SLEIGH RIDE. WOW! SLEIGH RIDE! OH, YES. AND WE WOULD ALL SING CHRISTMAS SONGS. SING IT NOW, DAD. HOW'D IT GO?

I GUESS WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE WORLD'S GREATEST CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MOM AND DAD. OKAY. LIKE WHAT? PLEASE, ANYTHING BUT A KITTEN. YOU SEE THE KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS ALL WANTED THE SAME THING FOR CHRISTMAS. FOR EACH OTHER TO BE HAPPY. TROUBLE WAS, THEY WERE THINKING WITH THEIR HEADS, NOT THEIR HEARTS. WHILE THINK WITH OUR HEAD IS USUALLY A PRETTY GOOD IDEA, IT CAN GET YOU INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE ON CHRISTMAS DAY. PRETTY NICE, HUH? OUCH! SO, THAT'S WHAT THE KIDS CALL DANCING THESE DAYS? I'LL BE BACK LATER, HONEY. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SO EARLY? I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF WORK HERE AND HEAD INTO TOWN. I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMMY AND BETH.

I WANTED IT SO BADLY, THAT I ALMOST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN I UNWRAPPED IT. AND, OH WELL, THERE IT WAS. IT'S ONE OF MY HAPPIEST MEMORIES. MY POINT EXACTLY. YOU SEE, I'M AFRAID WE WON'T HAVE TOO MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THOSE HAPPY MEMORIES FOR TOMMY AND BETH. Beth: THINK, EVERYBODY. THINK! WHAT KIND OF PRESENT CAN WE GIVE MOM AND DAD THAT WILL REALLY MAKE THEIR CHRISTMAS GREAT? YEAH, AND YOU'D BETTER THINK FAST BECAUSE TOMORROW'S CHRISTMAS EVE. WE KNOW, CHEDDAR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND US. YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH? WHAT? I WISH WE COULD BUY BACK ALL THE ANIMALS THAT DAD HAD TO SELL, WHEN THE BANK CALLED IN HIS LOAN. HEY. WHOA! WHOA! TIME OUT. NOT SO FAST. WHAT'S WRONG? WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S AWFUL PEACEFUL AROUND HERE WITHOUT THEM, IF YOU ASK ME. THAT PIG SNORED. AND THE COW ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE THE LAST WORD IN ANY ARGUMENT. YEAH.

( whiffs ) AIN'T NOBODY ASKING YOU, SHORT STUFF. ANYWAY, BACK TO OUR MAIN PROBLEM, WHAT TO GET MOM AND DAD. HEY, IT'D BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET THEM SOMETHING THEY REALLY NEED. LIKE A NEW CAR, TO REPLACE DAD'S OLD TRUCK. Cheddar: OH, A CONVERTIBLE. A BIG, BRIGHT, RED ONE. WITH A GREAT RADIO. AND SEATS THAT GO BACK. Tommy: WELL, MAYBE NOT TOO FAR BACK. ( sighs ) I KNOW WHAT THEY'D LOVE... A DREAM VACATION. TO PARIS, FRANCE. THEY COULD TAKE A SECOND HONEYMOON. Tommy: YEAH, THEY COULD SEE THE AWFUL TOWER. TOMMY, IT'S THE EIFFEL TOWER, NOT THE AWFUL TOWER. OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED THAT 'CAUSE IT'S AWFUL TALL. WHOA! I KNOW WHAT YOUR DAD REALLY NEEDS. WHAT? A BRAND NEW TRACTOR FOR PLOWING THE FIELDS.

IT WAS CHRISTMAS AFTER ALL AND HE WANTED HIS KIDS TO BE HAPPY. THIS REALLY STINKS. EVERYTHING GOOD COSTS MONEY. YEAH, OR THERE'S A MOUSETRAP IN FRONT OF IT. HEY, GUYS, REMEMBER WHEN DAD WAS TALKING ABOUT THOSE SLEIGH RIDES HE USED TO TAKE WHEN HE WAS A KID? YEAH? REMEMBER HOW HE SMILED? ( coughs ) WHAT DO YOU GOT IN MIND, SWEETPEA? COME HERE, EVERYBODY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA. WE'LL NEED SOME TOOLS AND KRIS'S BLANKET AND SOME PAINT. TOMMY, IN THE SHED IS DAD'S TOOL BOX... CHEDDAR, GRAB MOM'S SEWING KIT. I NEED YOUR HELP PULLING THIS WAGON APART. Jingles: SO BETH AND HER DAD BOTH HAD IDEAS OF HOW TO MAKE THIS CHRISTMAS A GREAT ONE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEIR IDEAS DON'T EXACTLY FIT TOGETHER. LIKE THIS TRICYCLE. LET ME SEE... TAB "A" GOES INTO SLOT "B". I GOT THAT. WHAT? OH, ANYWAY... BETH AND TOMMY GOT BUSY PUTTING THEIR GIFT TOGETHER. WITH KRIS'S AND CHEDDAR'S HELP, OF COURSE. THEY HAMMERED... THEY PAINTED... AND THEY SEWED... SINGING ALL THE WAY. ( "Jingle Bells" ) ( knocking ) SHH! YEAH, MOM. I THOUGHT YOU KIDS WOULD LIKE SOME... THANKS, BYE! ...LUNCH. ( horn toots ) OKAY. ( kids continue singing ) HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE? SOME TOP SECRET PROJECT OF THE KIDS. THEY'VE BEEN AT IT ALL DAY. OH, WE'LL I'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE. I'VE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS CHRISTMAS A GOOD ONE. HOW'S THAT? ( chuckles ) OH, YOU'LL SEE. WOW! LOOK AT THAT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S MIGHTY NICE. WOW! DID WE REALLY DO THAT? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MOM AND DAD'S FACES CHRISTMAS MORNING... WHEN WE COME RIDING OUT OF THE BARN... WITH KRIS HITCHED TO OUR NEW ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH. THIS WILL BE A CHRISTMAS THAT DAD WILL NEVER FORGET. Dad: HELLO! QUICK! COVER THE SLEIGH. HI, KIDS. HI, DAD, WHAT DO YOU WANT? UM... WELL... I NEED KRIS. OH, YEAH? WHAT FOR? I'M SORRY, KIDS. I SOLD HIM. ( gasping ) SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT DAD'S JUDGMENT BEING CLOUDY? HE WAS JUST TRYING TO DO WHAT HE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE TOMMY AND BETH HAPPY. AFTER ALL, HE KNEW KRIS WAS GOING TO A GOOD HOME... AND NOW THERE COULD BE PRESENTS FOR EVERYONE. BUT HE WAS TRYING SO HARD TO MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT... HE SORT OF GOT IT ALL WRONG. THE NEXT DAY... THE TOYMAKER CAME WITH A HORSE TRAILER TO TAKE KRIS AWAY. OKAY, HONEY, IT'S TIME FOR KRIS TO GO. I WON'T LET YOU TAKE HIM. I WON'T! NOW, HONEY, DON'T TAKE ON SO... IF YOUR PA SAYS THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO... THEN IT IS. ( Beth begins to cry ) OH, BETH, I KNOW YOU LOVE KRIS, WE ALL DO... BUT HE'S GOING TO BE FINE. HE'LL BE HAPPY IN HIS NEW HOME. PLEASE, HONEY, DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT ALREADY IS. GOODBYE, KRIS. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. AW, I'LL MISS YOU TOO, SWEETPEA. BYE-BYE, KRIS. SO LONG, JUNIOR. BE GOOD, NOW. WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE LAST ANIMAL ON THE PLACE. I DIDN'T MEAN WHAT I SAID ABOUT THERE BEING ONE TOO MANY. ( sniffles ) I KNOW YOU DIDN'T. I HOPE YOU GET THAT CHEESE FOR CHRISTMAS. IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE. HOLD ON, I ALMOST FORGOT. DAD, DON'T! WAIT! I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING TO REMEMBER US BY. I COULD NEVER FORGET YOU, SWEETPEA. Jingles: IT WAS THE SADDEST CHRISTMAS EVE BETH COULD EVER REMEMBER. AND ALL BECAUSE HER DAD WAS TRYING TO MAKE HIS KIDS HAPPY. SOMETIMES THINGS JUST GET ALL TURNED AROUND, DON'T THEY? BYE, KRIS. BETH! ( sighs ) WELL, THERE GOES THE BEST HORSE ANYONE EVER HAD. YEAH, HE WAS A GOOD SORT, ALL RIGHT. STRONG, LIKE LIMBURGER. BUT HE COULD ALSO BE AS GENTLE AS A SLICE OF MILD JACK. YEAH. WHAT'S THE MATTER, TOMMY, DO YOU HAVE A BELLY ACHE? NO, IT'S NOT THAT... IT'S... MY HEART. IT HURTS WHEN I THINK ABOUT KRIS. I THINK IT MIGHT BE BROKEN. KIDS, LOOK, I'M SORRY... I KNOW THIS IS HARD. WE ALL LOVE KRIS, BUT... AFTER ALL, THIS IS A FARM. SOMETIMES ANIMALS JUST HAVE TO BE SOLD. WE'LL GET ANOTHER HORSE SOMEDAY. I PROMISE. WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER HORSE. Mom: OH, COME ON, KIDS. SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME SUPPER. I'M NOT HUNGRY. I'M GOING TO BED. YEAH, ME TOO. ARE YOU SURE? I'M HUNGRY. WHAT ARE WE HAVING? ( sniffing ) Dad: BETH, TOMMY, KIDS... I JUST WANTED TO BUY YOU SOME NICE PRESENTS FOR CHRISTMAS. I KNOW YOU DID, DAD. THANKS. YEAH. WE UNDERSTAND. THEY'LL FEEL BETTER TOMORROW MORNING. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. ( engine starts ) Jingles: SO WITH A HEAVY HEART... DAD HEADED TO TOWN TO BUY SOME PRESENTS FOR HIS KIDS. BUT THE THINGS THAT SEEMED SO TEMPTING THE DAY BEFORE... DIDN'T SEEM QUITE SO WONDERFUL TONIGHT. BUT, HE HAD ONE GIFT HE THOUGHT HIS KIDS WOULD REALLY LOVE. ( knocking ) WHO IS IT? IT'S YOUR WICKED WITCH OF A MOM. AW, MOM, YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THAT. YEAH, WE JUST MISS KRIS. THAT'S ALL. HE WAS LIKE A PART OF THE FAMILY. TRY TO FORGIVE YOUR FATHER, SWEETIE, HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP. AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE NICE PRESENTS TO OPEN IN THE MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT, MOM. BUT THE ONLY THING WE WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS KRIS BACK. WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW. MAYBE WE COULD GET KRIS BACK SOME DAY. GEE, YOU THINK SO? WHY NOT? NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE. EXCEPT MAYBE GETTING SOME SLEEP ON CHRISTMAS EVE. GOOD NIGHT, TOMMY. GOOD NIGHT, BETH. SEE YOU GUYS IN THE MORNING. GOOD NIGHT, MOM. BETH, DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER GET TO SEE KRIS AGAIN? MAYBE TOMMY, YOU HEARD WHAT MOM SAID. "NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE." I SURE DO MISS HIM. REMEMBER THAT TIME HE GOT INTO MOM'S FLOWER BED... AND ATE ALL HER SNAPDRAGONS? ( chuckles ) YEAH. HE FELT SO BAD HE PLOWED A HALF ACRE BY HIMSELF THE NEXT DAY. OR, HOW ABOUT THE TIME CHEDDAR POURED PEPPER IN HIS FEEDBAG? HE PRACTICALITY SNEEZED HIMSELF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY. BOY, HE WAS MAD.
