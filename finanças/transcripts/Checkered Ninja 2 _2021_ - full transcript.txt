We can sit here like idiots and wait for the clue to fall from the sky. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - The list is in the club? f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - Yes. Probably in this. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - Alex, are we going to have dinner here? f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - Yes. - Thank you for inviting us here. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - I prefer McDonald's. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - You surprised me. - But you took us on vacation. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 It is true. - I wanted to repay you. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - Of course. - You shouldn't have paid. f5850fbc6fee2d714b8bd6523cfdad72 - I care about this.
