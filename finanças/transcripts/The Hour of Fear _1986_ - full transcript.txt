TIME OF FEAR (HOUR OF FEAR) Who's there? Is somebody there? Respond. Answer me. Who is it? Respond... Answer me... What is going on? God help me, why are you doing this to me? Mother...I swear... I didn't want this to happen. Don't worry, my son. We'll take care of her body. I think we should go to our house in the country. There we'll find more women for you. Sound good? The lights are all on. The dog is probably awake still. Don't let him see us. I put an ad in the newspaper, we should have a new driver soon. I don't know. It seems much too risky... What if he discovers our secret? No, son... Just the two of us will stay here. He will only come when we need him. Besides... We'll only hire someone with no close relatives or family. Lourdes? This way, Salvador. What's going on here? Why are you crying, Lourdes? How is Eliana? It's all because of you that this happened... You give me no other choice! Can't you realize that you're wrong? You don't have the courage to face him! - Is that what you think? - We both know it's the truth! I asked my boyfriend, my only love, to help! I need this job! It's just as a maid. Those people are very strange. Maids are usually for people who have a family. I'm just thankful I found a job. Congratulations, little sister. But it'd really be better if you speak to Salvador. No, please... No... I'm going... I just wish he could act human. We'll talk every week. Goodbye... Bye... Sister... I haven't heard from her since... Why? Why? Did you check there? I will go check myself. I'll take care of this. I know Eliana very well. She was deeply in love with you. I just can't understand... Why those people, without a family, need a maid? I went looking for her at Patrola. But the mistress was acting strange. She said... They didn't know my sister... And had never seen her. I was overwhelmed by those words. Without hope... Fearful... I'd never see her again. I can't understand how Eliana could disappear. Why? That woman was very strange. Dressed all in black. Really macabre. Eliana lied to you... And deceived me all this time. Seems like nobody's at home. Hello? Are you at the house? I thought maybe you ran away. Listen here, you whore. I'm stopping by... If you don't have my money I'll smash your face in. What do you want? It's me... You don't follow orders? I said wait at your house, instead you're here. Either way is fine. I'm not whoring for you anymore. Understand? Look here, bitch. - No, please stop... - Come here you whore... No! No, please stop... Who are you? [indistinguishable background talk] This is why I don't trust women. They're all liars. Only thinking about money. It's not that bad, buddy. Yes it is. They're all fake. Eliana ran away, never to return... She'll come back someday. I don't know why she left... We were happy. Salvador, I'd prefer to die... Than live without you... SÃ©o Paulo without you life would be a nightmare. That's true. It was a beautiful moment. ...that disappeared with her... I don't know where... Come in and take a seat. Dear... This place belongs to... Me and my son. And you'll enjoy it with us, too. There's only one thing you must do. Just be nice to him. Thanks for your help. You are very kind. I always wanted a brother. He is more than a brother, my daughter. Mommy... This is my son. He's so handsome. Go on. Have some fun, my daughter. Go... Go... Make yourself comfortable, dear. And have fun. Have fun. Look, how beautiful. - Take it easy, sonny. Calm down. - Get on the bed! Take it easy. Really. Calm down. Don't... Not like this... Please... The binding is too tight... It hurts... Please stop... Please stop... Please... I'm only happy by hurting your little ass. What's going on with you? Tell me. I'll show you what's going on! I can show you instead of telling! You're just like your father, my son. I'm glad he's not still alive... Otherwise, I'd have to kill him. But I still love him, my son. Allow me this moment of grief. Mourning the day he died. Lourdes... - Hey, Lourdes. - Hello, Salvador. Lourdes... Here. Look at this. An ad from the people who hired Eliana. Advertising employment for a private chauffeur. I think it's strange. Another family oriented job. What are you planning to do? I'm going to get that job. And find out what's going on in that house. - The water looks refreshing. - Yes, mother. Catch! Madame, he's her about the ad. Come here. - You can go. - Yes, ma'am. - Good day. - Yes. Are you a good chauffeur? With references? I've been a chauffeur since I was 18. As you probably saw in our ad, my chauffeur can't have any relatives. Can I know why? I don't like any such problems and petty annoyances. Then I'm the man for the job. I'm single. No relatives or friends. I pay double minimum wage. In cash. If you are interested... you can start tomorrow. Alright. I will be here tomorrow. See you later. I must be clear... When will they learn that Alberto belongs to me? Only me! My son was never a blessing. Rather, the embodiment of Lucifer! What's this? Mother and I talked about you. But, Cristandra... You're like the Nymph of the Sacred Bath, created by God himself. Your words arouse my very being... Your presence is a whirlwind of splendour. I am completely fascinated by you. I've never felt this before...never... A slave to your beauty. That's me. AIberto... Don't ever leave me. I can't be a man... Without you... You're my life... I so want to believe you. Believe, Crisandra... You have my assurance. Let's make this world happy together. Believe... And enjoy my warmth, Cassandra. With... The angels... Otherwise... The two of us... Hold me. Caress me. I don't want to lose this moment. Still clinging to the last thread of life? How pathetic... I will do anything... It hurts... Look at yourself... Why aren't you dead. Give it up! You just need to die! Into the ground! Take...me. Don't kill me. How will we remember this moment? - As time stands still in honor of life. - Yes. Yes. To life, my love. Stop breathing. You're getting buried. I want to live... Help! Julia...You are a pathetic disappointment Please... I want to live... You'll soon live in the Cauldrons of Hell. Have mercy and save me... I'm pregnant. You can give birth in the dirt while I help my son. It's over! Have mercy...Have mercy. Don't! Don't! Don't! Demon's have no mercy. I hope you eat dirt and choke on it! Now the farewell... We drink to eternal happiness. Listen... This is sacred... The infinite beauty of rainbows... Fill the room to honor you. You bitch! Mission accomplished. She will no longer threaten our tranquility. I want to live! No! No! Help me... Please help me... No, you are dead! Get away from me! Mommy! You belong in the ground. Please...I'm pregnant. Please don't... Her heart is still beating, mother! Stop breathing, whore. The evil has passed, son. Her place is the Shadow World. Will it be alright? It's alright, son. Your mother is here. The time of evil has passed. It's as good as the last time. - What's the name of the city again? - San Guardina... At least we can get a good beer here. Anything else for you? No, thanks. Waiter...some beans. Beans? Refried beans? I'm hungry and they're cheap/ Wait for me here. Right. Money first, you don't have a tab here. The cash...then the food, young lady Son of a bitch, I always pay my check. You serve me or I'll trash the place. If you break even one glass, you'll be sorry... Come on! Stop! Stop! Stop! No hitting! Stop! What's this? What's with you, lady? I hit you because you hit that girl. - So you'll pay this girl's check, eh? - Yes. Fine. The food, broken glasses, bottles... Look at this mess. The broken bottles. She did all this damage. Give me 300 cruzados. A bit more. Good... Now, please take your bitch away. Sorry for the disturbance, guys. Come with me, child. ??? Where do you live, love? My boyfriend just dumped me. You can stay at my house. Come see my place. I've got money. Comfort. And plenty of room. Yeah. I want to, but... Why are you doing this for me? My mission is to do nice things. Come on, let's get going. A walking bag of money. Girl...You want to know something... If you don't want more trouble, you'll leave now. You're talking shit... You're just jealous. Get ready, son. I'm on my way. See you soon. - This is my son. - Hello. Nice to meet you. You can go now, but in case I need you, stay by the phone. I could wait right here. No. Go now. Alright... Damn. I don't want to leave. Something is very wrong. No more. No. Release me... Let me go... No! You're hurting mother! Stop it! Stop it! Let her go! - No don't shot! Put it down! - Stay back or I'll shot you! - Stay away! - Give me the gun! - Stay away! - Come on son give me the gun! - Leave me alone! - Give me the gun! Don't come or I'll shoot. Stop it now Stop or I'll shoot! Give me the gun... - No... - Give me the gun you son of a bitch! Give it to me or I'll kill you! No stay away or I'll shoot! What's wrong with you? Snap out of it! - What's wrong? - Shut up, shut up! Oh my God! Don't try anything foolish. This ammunition is poisonous. You will soon regret snooping around here. Who is buried in this grave? Is it Eliana? The girl who was working for you when she disappeared. What happened to her? Eliana is buried here with the others. All because of my husband... Why? Murderer! Murderer! Why? Why? My husband passed this curse on to us. His lust was too much for me but I still loved him deeply. And I love my son even though he killed Marcelo. Stop at once! No! Oh my son! What have you done?! My son! Multiple murders... Buried as well. Yes. That's what I said. One moment. Hey, Lady... Girls are buried behind the house. I'm fine. Fine. Madame? Madame? Madame... Madame... Madame... Madame... Madame... My God.
