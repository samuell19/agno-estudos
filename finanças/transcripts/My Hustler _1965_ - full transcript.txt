Colly, What do you do without a uniform? When I took over your task was to serve me. And do you call this service or devotion? It's not really a good idea. You are totally devoid of uniform. The announcement required a servant who was very loyal to discipline. By discipline I meant boots... some knowledge of leather whips... and you present yourself in this way! It's obvious that you don't have any idea at all of the kind of servant I had in mind. Do you know why you were hired? It does nothing. Look down on the beach that blond guy. Look down there. Do you see it? Now, you have been hired not only for service and discipline, but also as a bodyguard. And that means you have to take care of that boy too. Take care of him for any of his requests. It may have very special requests. If you want something, you have to bring it to him immediately. If, on the other hand, it causes us difficulties, You have to help me solve the problems. Do you follow me? Yes, ladies. So, okay. Bring me some ice for my drink. Hire people to be served and do not serve you in any way. I made a mistake in taking on that crazy Colly dl. I was attracted to him because... Its Syrian name means "the goddess of destruction". Of course she is a goddess, not a god. But a great goddess. It has ivory breasts studded with gold fragments. I believe that there are snakes clustered around the breast. Reptiles clinging to the breasts... is a wonderful idea to represent the destruction. Thanks Colly, now you can go. I will call you when I need it. "In the middle of our life's journey...". "Where is Genevi?ve, the beautiful Genevi?ve? "The follies of the sweet life are over". Well, I'm not really sure. I think some of the follies of the sweet life should not end. Where is that magnificent blond god that I brought here? Ah, here it is on the beach to tan. All it does is spread sunscreen. In the long run it will be worth it, it will be worth it! But I don't see it anywhere. Ah, yes, here it is: absolutely wonderful... is like a god, I would say. Oh my God, behold, Genevi?ve. Hello Ed. I'm afraid you'll make Ursula Andress pale. - How are you today? - Well, well, well. - So that's the new purchase? - But have you already seen it? I was spying on the porch, I couldn't wait to arrive. Colly! - The ml bird has told everything. - Do you want to drink something, dear? Yes, one of your usual water cocktails. A cocktail for Madame Genevi?ve. What did the bird tell you? Ml spoke about the new telephone service "calls the Marchetta". It's a new service in New York. Rentals on the phone and they come here to Fire Island. - Yes, I bet... - What do you think of him? I'm sure you made him come to talk about literature. From how you look at him you understand what you think of him. I find this interesting. It's my last weekend, I hope you've organized a party. Dear, the party is not for you, but for me. - Remember that. - I will remind you of that. It looks exactly like Lemnia. On several occasions you have demonstrated not to remember exactly what is your role here: despite you living here next door for several years... I keep reminding myself of my role here. But anyway, we'll see. Now I have nothing to lose as I leave. I no longer have to sit here and loaf. Immediately take off your lascivious gaze from that wonderful body. What do you think about? To the tower of Pisa? - I was just about to say so. - Or the Empire State Building? - How stupid, I had forgotten it. - Or a nice sausage? How do you like them: big and big or beautiful and long? You see, I'm always so bad about it... - It is so wonderful. - What do you think about your hair? It seems to have come out of the "Elizabeth Arden" beauty salon. I told him, "Make some blond reflections, just some reflections. That is how these males always start. Then the hair gets longer and must continue to dye it... and the next step is the miniskirt. You always have to say some perverse things. But I don't think you really are. I've heard that he's still virgin... somewhere. A virgin in person. Freshly fresh from "Call a Marchetta". A nice morsel... Don't you want to pass your toes between those golden locks? No? Maybe you prefer to run with spiked heels on the hairs of his chest. Well, tell me what you want to do with him. Don't you really want to stop with all this nonsense? What would you like to do with him? You are always here to smell their smell. It is very simple. Just take me a little revenge. - That is, lure a marquette? - Perhaps. - What do you do when you're with them? - It's not a revenge.... - Do you want to have sex with him? - You know very well that this is not the case. The only thing I enjoy is going there and distract him enough to make you suffer a little. And what would you not do? Go there and scratch it And thou that sendest the guard of the body, and other nonsense which thou doest. Why don't you like having sex with that guys? That is not the problem. Do not experience erotic enjoyment. Only a sort of perverse pleasure in stealing boys from fennel. Especially steal them from you, but it's not really... You have stolen enough of it from me. What was the name of the last one who... - You are the port in this beach. - Poor Gordon of Cambridge. - We have this beach in common. - Do you remember Achilles, do you? Every morning I wake up and see that guys out there. Achilles, yes . He had to flee your persecution. - Always bring memories to life. - Well, it really happened. It has nothing to do with memories. But it looks very much like Gordon. A bit.... Are you attracted by their appearance or their psychological condition? You did something reprehensible! From their infantilism... and you propose yourself as the queen mother To protect them and steal them from "Queen Ed"! Queen Ed? I do nothing wrong with them. Ml likes to have sex. I do not want to discuss this with you. Keep coming back to the subject and the point is not that at all. I have fed, paid, maintained them. Keep coming back to sex, not to mention your responsibilities. - The game is boring, it's always the same. - Eye to eye, my dear one. - But wait... - Dear, It's you who... You sent it to some marajas in India, what could I do? I am sure he is very happy with his marriagia...wherever it may be. Are you bothered by flies? I will be spraying something so that you can leave. You will see that it works. Oh my God, let him have his eyes off! I'm just having fun watching it and you become all excited and jealous! I'm only afraid that in a while you'll reach it on the beach and you'll put your clutches or something like that on them. I doubt that. My dear, this time I won't allow you to, you can be sure. I have not done it badly with anyone, but it is possible that you want to do it with this here. What do you want to do? He wants it to become all hot and burned and then give it up. I have no intention of exciting and then frustrating him. Lift up their masculinity and want to try their heterosexuality Or as you call it... and then you don't conclude. How satisfied are the revenues? My only satisfaction is to make you suffer a little, to see you jealous. There must be a name for creatures like you! I am sure you will find one. "Frociarola", this is perfect. This is not my occupation, are just your neighbour. There are not many occupations in which I imagine you are busy, at least during the summer months here on Fire Island. Which other things are you interested in? What do you do when you are here? I don't think you realize me with all the hustle and bustle that is here. What do you do when you don't look at this house with your telescopes? Do you sleep or spend time looking at our activities? You know that I didn't care less about your stories. - Only this. - Ah, this intrigues you. Yes, this intrigues me. There's someone there, look. Colly, answer and say that there are none. There is a boy with him. Genevi?ve, see who he is. Hello! Take it up here. Hey you, save! Bring him here, I want to know what he's doing there. Sorry, how do you call yourself? Tell him to come up. Make a mark on it. Hey, come on. Who was Colly on the phone? Did you get rid of it? - Are you coming here? - I do not know. - What is it doing there? - Come here! He will not be a virgin for long if we do not try to do something. Yes, you can come here? What do you think he's doing? Colly, be alert because I don't know what kind this is. I really don't like a lot. Oh, I know him! It's the end of the ballet! Prepare you... The fairy candy in person! Courage, why don't you feel comfortable? Why did you call me? What did you do on the beach with my boyfriend? Your beach? I was just talking.
