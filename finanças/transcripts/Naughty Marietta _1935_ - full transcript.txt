Go on, back to your room. Oh, my first golden lovebird. The rest will die of envy. The only pair in Paris, Your Highness. Yes, I know. And you're practically giving them away for three Louis. Oh, no, Your Highness. Now if Your Highness will accept this as a present from me? Oh, he's such a little darling. And I will order a blue warbler for you in the next shipment. Oh, you're too generous. Here, put him in here. You're so generous. I would order a stork if Your Highness wishes it. Bouger, that's rather an alarming suggestion. [laughs] - Goodbye, Bouger. - Goodbye. Oh, Bouger, look, the old friend. Hello. Oh, dear. [indistinct chatter] Way for the princess. - Oh, how are you, sweetie? - Fine. - Oh, Batite. - Your Highness. Look, I'm taking this little bit of fluff to Herr Schuman. Think he'll like him? He'll like the sight of you more, Your Highness. We haven't seen you down here recently, Your Highness. Oh, no, it's getting more difficult to make excuses at home. For today the sun shines, now I can finish my sonnet. Oh, you'd better save those pretty speeches for your sonnet. You may follow me to Herr Schuman. Oh, but Don Carlos is coming this afternoon. And your uncle told me to be-- But I didn't ask Don Carlos to come. Oh, but walking in this part of town. Oh, well, Prunella, as you've always said "I have my native dignity." [laughs] Herr Schuman. But, Your Highness, you better look to your dignity. [laughs] Madame la princesse. Oh, Pachette, you little monkey, you've grown. Oh, a little puppy. May I please pet him? - I love puppies. - Oh, you do? Bet he has a lot of little brothers and sisters at Bouger's shop, you run along and tell Bouger I said to give you one and I'll pay for it. Ooh wee! Oh, thank you, princess. Wee! - Wonderful, princess. - Hello. You wait here, Prunella, I'll only be a moment. [laughs] [knocks] [knocks] [music note] [music note] - Oh, Marie. - Schuman, darling. [speaking in foreign language] It's so long I don't see you. I know. I thought of you every moment, Schuman. You know me wonderful indeed. Excuse me for a minute, please, excuse me. Oh, no, no, no, don't be silly, Schuman. Oh, look, what's this? Oh, I heard the sweet voice. - Oh. - Frau Schuman. How are you? I have a new pupil for you. - Look. Look. - Pup? Really? Oh, thank a thousand. [speaking in foreign language] And Schuman can teach him to yowl on his high notes as he did me. Well, and, uh, and how goes everything now with my baby. She's happy, yes? Has everything got straightened out at home? - Well, Schuman. - Oh. You don't got to tell me. Still that Don Carlos, huh? Oh, my uncle keeps talking all the time about my marrying him. Uh, if my grandchildren was only free to marry like other girls. Well, I won't marry him. I tell you, I won't marry him. That's right, don't marry a man when you don't love him. But I haven't seen a man I could love, Frau Schuman. Certainly not among those paying powder-puffs of Versailles. But someday I'll see him. I'd like to see him standing tall and strong in the wind and in the sun. And I don't have to crawl up on my hands and knees to make him even notice me. Oh, but that's enough about me. Oh, what was that tune you were playing when I came in, Schuman? Well, you know, every day the bells from the top of St. Ann they-they steal into this room and they seem to always push me push me towards the spinet. Wait, I show you. Oh, thank you. [piano music] What would they be saying in major? Can you tell me? It's like the music of the spheres, isn't it? The melody of the universe. Everything. Yeah. Mysterious, ain't it? Oh, sweetly so. [piano music] Oh, look, Schuman, look, let's give it tempo. So.. [piano music] Ah, yeah, yeah, sure. A-and then, then let's raise it, look. [piano music] - Ah, so. - How is that? - That's beautiful. - Oh. Oh, Marcel, Francois. Ah, that Marcel and that Francois. They beat their instruments like it was horses. Oh, but I must see them.

She came home about an hour ago, Your Highness. That will do. You must understand, Don Carlos, this is one of her little jokes. She probably wants to surprise us. Then we shall see her now? We shall attend her in her apartment immediately. Madame, you will follow. We'll turn the little surprise on her ourselves. Si, we shall surprise the little flower in her garden. Richard, they are your new guests. Now try and be polite to them. [squawks] Oh, quack-quack yourself. [knock on door] Yes? Come in. Don Carlos is so impatient that he storms your apartment in person. I am honored, monsieur. I am impatient for the time when I can come alone. And your three future sisters-in-law. They bring your wedding garments from Madrid. And the clothes. 'The hose.' 'The corsets.' 'The chemise.' Has there been a death in your family? A death? It is only the traditional color of our house. [squawks] [clears throat] You will not have to wear it. You may go. Will you be here long, Don Carlos? Only until I take my lovely nino back to Spain with me. Uh, shall we discuss the wedding plans and the manner in which-- Oh, couldn't we discuss it downstairs? If you'll excuse me, please. I've only just returned from shopping and.. But yes. We shall expect you downstairs for chocolate in not more than five minutes. Oh, but, uncle, one moment, please. I'm not coming down for chocolate in five minutes. You may go. And I'm not going to be nice to your Don Carlos. You're going to marry Don Carlos. Oh, no, I won't. There's nothing you can do about it. The banns have already been published. Published? When did you do that? This morning, by order of the king. You'll be married in Notre Dame, Wednesday week. Oh, I see. - It's all been settled then? - 'Precisely.' 'And you're very fortunate.' The king wants to keep you near him. He's prepared to offer Don Carlos an appointment at Versailles. Well, can't you see what that means? Can't you see what he wants? The king doesn't care whom he forces me to marry just so long as he gets me at Versailles. 'I said you are very fortunate.' Then I won't do it. I tell you I will not enter into that life of degradation and horror and corruption. Perhaps you prefer confiscation of your land. Exile, disgrace, to be confined in a cell and left there and forgotten. No, no, he, he wouldn't do that. He has done it before this. We shall expect you downstairs for chocolate in not more than five minutes. [piano music] - Madame la princesse. - Oh, Marietta, come in. I've come to say goodbye, madame la princesse. Goodbye? I'm leaving your uncle's services, madame. I'm going with the casquette girls. We sail from Hobb day after tomorrow. Sail? Who are the casquette girls? They're sending shiploads of them to Louisiana to New Orleans. They need girls of good character to become wives of the men there and to raise families in the colonies. Oh. Don't you know whom your husband will be? Oh, some trapper or planter or soldier perhaps. We're given a dowry by the king. Oh, I see. But, Marietta, weren't you one day going back to Marseille to marry your Giovanni? Oh, we're both too poor. Forgive me, Your Highness. France is not for poor people these days. Oh, there should be somebody else, madame. A husband, my own home. Much better than staying here washing somebody else's dishes. Maybe I can become a new person there and people will forget that I was ever a scullery maid. Marietta, is that all that keeps you from staying here and marrying Giovanni? - Because you are both too poor? - That is all, madame. When, when are you supposed to leave for Lahav? Tonight, by van with the rest of them. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Marietta. Wait a minute. Marietta, come on, tell me more about these casquette girls. I must know all about them. All hear ye! All hear ye! Five hundred Louis D'or reward! Juni Louisa, character and credentials guaranteed by Monsieur Gabell, chief justice of Soissons.

Now you wait right here. Don't you go away. Oh, we're leaving right away, aren't we? - Yes, almost immediately. - Oh, good. So you think you'll find the princess in that lot? (male #4) 'If she's running away, she could be anywhere.' Haven't you any father or mother? - No. - No one came to see you off? Oh, yes. Yes, I have a brother. He came to see me off. He's over in the docks somewhere. - Show him to me. - Oh, yes. Well, he's over there somewhere. I think he.. Oh, I don't know. He's somewhere around here somewhere. I don't.. There he is, there.. Goodbye, goodbye, brother. Goodbye, goodbye, brother. Take good care of grandfather. 'Don't let him go out in the rain all the time.' Take good care. Goodbye. Don't say goodbye, sister.

I thought you were going with the casquettes to be married in Louisiana? - Why, no, Your-- - Quiet, girl. - Your Highness-- - Weren't you? - Yes, Your Highness. - Then it's true. Madame la princesse went in your place. Yes, Your Highness, but please don't-- Enough. To the minister of marine. [indistinct chatter] - There. Is that better? - Mmm-hmm, that's fine. How do you know it'll fit when you don't know who you're gonna marry? Well, if he's too large, it'll shrink. If it's too small, it'll stretch. That's fine. Sorry to disturb you, miss. You're still busy with that letter? Oh, good evening, captain. It isn't a letter. Well, whatever it is, you'd better get it done. If this South wind holds up we'll be in New Orleans in two days. Two days? Wonderful. - Did you hear that? - It's about time. I may have sight of the mouth of the Mississippi River tomorrow morning. Oh, thank heavens. We'll be able to get off this boat at last. It seems years. Rene, did you hear that? Only two more days. - Is seasick one word or two? - One word. I'm going to be almost sorry to leave the boat. Feel like losing the last touch of home. I'm going to have so many children I won't have time to be homesick. First thing I'm going to do is get a real meal. I', gonna have sweetmeats and pastry and thick chocolate. - 'Oh, don't.' - I've changed my mind, I think I'll marry a soldier. Oh, I wouldn't marry a man who had to get up in the middle of the night and fight Indians. I'm not gonna marry a soldier. I'm gonna marry a farmer. What about you, Marietta? Have you decided what kind of a man you want? I don't want any. Then why in the moon did you come out here? Oh, for the sea voyage. Well, it's in your contract with the king that you do get married, flippy. If you don't, you'll have another nice long sea voyage back to France. - I'm not going back to France. - Hmm, you'll see. I know one thing, I'm not gonna marry a man unless I'm in love with him. Well, listen to who's going to pick and choose. That one. You know, back home, you never had a chance to marry anyone. Oh, you shouldn't torture the poor child like that. Oh, Julie dear, now don't cry, don't. I can't stop being afraid. I wanna go back home. Yes, I know, but everything will turn out alright. To go with a strange man to his house like they keep describing I can't look at it like most of them. No, of course not. Julie dear, you hope to find a fine young man over in this new world, don't you? Oh, yes. Don't you, Marietta? Why, perhaps I do. Perhaps I do. Surely, everything we do must have a meaning. - What's this? - Oh. It's a song written by a sweet old man. The only real friend I had back home. I'm trying to find the words to it.

Uh, and now these young ladies will be escorted to the convent where they will be housed and taken care of until such time as they go to their own homes. So will all of you, young men who have lived in lonely solitude waiting for this great day be there at the convent this afternoon? There you will find for yourselves 'the helpmates for your work' 'the solace for your lonely hours' the future mothers of France. [crowd cheering] Go on over and talk to them. You'll never get a wife standing here. What about you going? Well, I'm waiting for you. Well, John, there's a lovely girl over here I want you to meet.

We had some very important business with Colonel Andre. I assure you, madame, I had a lengthy report on my trip north. The Indian affairs are something to consider. [scoffs] The Redskins again. Yes, exactly. That was it, the Redskins. I suppose that accounts for the large red spot under your ear. Wipe it off. Uh, uh, uh.. Oh, oh, dear. Oh, no. Nobody's going.. Go away. No, no, I-- You don't understand, I can't. I can't, I mean I won't.. I'm not, not going to marry anyone of you.

'You said that you came from Marseille.' - Yes. - Well, that's not a lie. (Gaspard) 'You're 23 years old. Is that a lie?' No, Your Excellency. [laughs] - Yes, you're in good health? - 'Yes.' [laughs] I haven't found a lie so far. You're of excellent character, your conducts and behavior 'have always been above reproach.' That's it, that's it, that's the one. You, uh.. You're, uh, what? I'm sorry, Your Excellency. Yeah, well, I-I know it's really-- Don't stand there stuttering and gaping. Do something. Uh, uh, well, certainly. Of course. Uh, the guard. Uh, get the guard. Uh, yeah. Uh, this is outrageous. What are you doing among all these sweet girls? You have no right here. Oh, but surely, here in New Orleans you have room for a girl who doesn't necessarily wished to become a housewife but who likes to be charming and pleasant? [Gaspard chuckles] 'What? Yeah, uh..' Gaspard, are you going to allow that brazen woman to stand there and insult decent women with that talk? No, of course not! Uh, here, uh, just take her to the, uh.. Take her, uh, find her a home somewhere. Uh, ahem, uh, girls like that coming over here. And you thought you knew her? I, uh, yeah, uh, strange. Very strange. Uh, uh, let's, uh, go over here and just talk to the.. - Oh, Marietta? - Oh, it's alright. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, don't worry. - He's very nice. - But very poor. Does it matter? [chuckles] Here's a little wedding present for both of you. - Oh, Marietta. - Goodbye. You know, you're lucky you were given over into my care you little chicken, and that is-- Don't pay any attention to him, sweetmeat. You talk to me. You know, I think it's wonderful that a girl like-- Sergeant. Alright, I'll take over the custody of the lady. Juts a moment, mercenary. You're not telling me-- Sergeant! It's unfair to take advantage of my rank but then the temptation is too great. Why this sudden interest, Captain Warrington? Oh, I admit I'm a loud kind of a fellow problem when I'm on duty but I'm in town for a rest now. I had a bath and a shave and I'm feeling very kindly to the world. I thought your world didn't include women. Women, oh, as you said back there was to be charming. Oh, I wish it was full of them and they all look like you. Well, fortunately for me, I have the choice of my companion. What's the matter with me now that all the cards are face up? I've always gotten on very well with charming women. Sometimes a little too well. It's difficult to get away. Well, you'll have no difficulty getting away from me, I assure you. In fact, I'm looking forward to your departure with infinite delight. Marietta, you toss words off your tongue like a lady of quality. That doesn't quite go with the story of you life, does it? Oh, oh, little quality and culture and speech has, has never been a drawback to me, I found. Oh, maybe you've been missing a lot of fun. Didn't you have a hanker for informality? You know, I've always found that-- Monsieur, understand here and now. All I ask of you is that you conduct me to, to wherever I'm supposed to live. And then it's au revoir? No, not au revoir, but a lasting goodbye. Well, this is a new school of charm but just be patient, blue eyes. Maybe I'll get the hang of it between here and there. And just a minute, this way. [singing in foreign language] Ah, good evening, Captain Warrington. What can I do? I'm so glad to see you here. Mademoiselle desires a residence. - You have a house vacant? - Oh, but, yes. This way, mademoiselle. People are rather gay in this corner of town. [man laughs] [people laughing] Rather gay. What became of the former occupant? A little brunette, wasn't it? Ah, she was married, captain. Oh, come, come, that's deplorable. A lieutenant from Fort Delaware. They left up river only this morning and in such a hurry. You are welcome to the supplies, mademoiselle. Thank you. And now please, a month's rent in advance. Uh, three Louis. - Here you are. - And for what? I have money. [chuckles] I mean, I had money. I insist upon the pleasure. Well, you should be repaid, monsieur as soon as I find work. - Oh, blue eyes. - Now, mademoiselle. I hope you will be very comfortable-- I shall dedicate myself to that achievement. Thank you for the trouble, monsieur but as you go, you better throw on your hat. Your head is very large. It will be frightful if you caught cold in it. Is the night that chilly, little one? It's chillier. And now will you please unlock the door and leave immediately? I know what's the matter with you. Your stomach's empty. No body can be charming when they're all hollow in their little pork basket. Let's have some supper, huh? Ah, the brunette was generous. Wine, crumpets and eggs. - You shall cook me an omelet. - You leave here immediately. An omelet with red peppers. I never cooked in my life and I'd die before I cook you a radish. You don't cook a radish, you eat it alive. See. It's very simple. Break one yourself. There's your omelet. 'Now is that nice?' Think of all the trouble descampados hands experience to lay those eggs. With one gesture-- For the last time, get out. Here, you're tired. Sit down, relax. Oh, blue eyes, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be that informal. I really am sorry. I'll tell you what to do. You push me down. I'll call the police and push you out. Poor blue eyes because you see, I'm the police. [gasps] Oh, you.. [instrumental music] Hey, Rudolpho. Hi, Captain Dick. Where's that plump daughter of yours? - The one who sings? - Oh, she got married, see. She moved down to Biloxi settlement. But, monsieur, my daughter, Suzette, she sing too. Suzette. [speaking in foreign language] [instrumental music] It's awful everybody getting married. - Must be the time of the year. - I suppose so. ♪ Zing zing zizzy zizzy zing zing mandolinas gay ♪ ♪ Zing zing zizzy zizzy zing zing boom boom aye ♪ Competition, little ice cake.

I do not wish to be included in that. But that was no street singer's wobbling, blue eyes. The quality of those tones were something. I-I used to appear at the opera comique. I see, until a manager wished you to appear as Lady Godiva and you refused. Yes, uh, something like that, yes. So you took to being charming instead? I've already proclaimed that, haven't I? Blue eyes, you're very beautiful but I think you're also a liar. Monsieur, I am what I, what I am. [doorbell rings] Go ahead. Maybe it's somebody to put me out. Robert De Juvenale. Mademoiselle, you are at home? Oh, oh. - Well, gentlemen? - Well, Captain Warrington? Oh, uh, you came to see the young lady? - Yes. - I can't blame you for that. - But all three of you together? - Oh, no. (Robert) 'I didn't come with these, uh, gentlemen. I got here first.' (male #11) 'First or last will not matter to mademoiselle.' 'Let her make the choice.' Such beauty demands the finest setting. He must please mademoiselle. That is the most important. She should have only the best man in New Orleans. I agree with you. You are very flattering. And now, thank you and goodnight. Now you see, blue eyes, I've saved you from a very dull evening. And that's.. Hey, blue eyes! Good morning, Capt. Warrington. I didn't expect you to be-- I have an appointment with the governor. And the ill-feeling between the French troops and the mercenaries are steadily growing in intensity, sir. Captain Warrington, sir. Oh, show him in. Show him in. And now, sir, about the plans for the new barracks-- So bottle that. Some other time. [laughs] Good morning, Richard. - Your Excellency. - Here, here's the, uh.. Here's the month's pay for you and your men. Thanks, I'll be glad to get it. And you'll be happy to hear, you won't have to hang around town any longer. I promised the council this morning that you'd go out 'and round up those cutthroats.' You'll leave immediately, I suppose. I'll arrange to issue 'any supplies and equipment necessary.' No, we won't be able to break camp for several days yet. - 'Why, what's the matter?' - Well. The boys are pretty tired, pretty done in. They've already had a week of rest. I think I'll give them a few days longer. In don't think your boys want those few days as much as you do. - What do you mean? - Uh, uh, yes, what is this? Uh, Captain Warrington made use of his superior rank the other day and took over the duties of my soldiers. I'm so accustomed to taking over the duties of his soldiers it's second nature by now. - Sir! - Uh, oh wait. - What is this? - It's that casquette girl. Warrington insists on taking charge of her himself. Captain Warrington! Why, this is.. You.. Uh, Major Bonnell, uh, would you mind? I'd like to speak to the captain alone. Why, this is a very serious matter, Richard. I mean, you can't, you deliberately disobeyed my order.. My boy! You couldn't have done anything that would have pleased me more. I was wondering how I could get in touch with her. Now tell me, where did you nest our little lost pigeon? - Where is she? - I don't know. Oh, come now, is that the way to treat your great benefactor? Haven't I always been good to you? It isn't like you to be selfish. - You've changed, Richard. - I know I have. Oh, but you wouldn't begrudge me an opportunity to see her again. I mean, in person, to apologize for the way I acted. Besides, you're going away. I'll see that she's comfortable and well taken care of in your absence. Who is she? Uh, who, uh, who is she.. Oh, there you are, my dear. Yes, here I am, but who is she? She? Oh, well, i-it's not.. We were talking about a horse. - A horse? - Uh, yes. Uh, Richard's horse. I didn't want her to be left alone in his absence. I mean, she's a very sensitive creature. A beautiful animal. Yes, a-a long, slender neck and such withers. Withers? Oh, she has, uh, withers, hasn't she, Richard? I didn't know you were so fond of horses. Oh, I've always.. I've never.. I'm a great lover of horses, am I not, my dear? Just trot her around, Richard. do you understand? Yes, do trot her over. I want to see this horse that he's got to apologize to. Oh, apol.. I-I don't.. - I'll be going. - Oh, no. Just stay for a moment and have a glass of Madeira. Better save it for your horse. My horse? Your horse. [chuckles] He-he's always.. Isn't he? I'll, uh, I'll just walk to the gate with Richard, my dear. Gaspard, come back here. - Good day, madame. - Won't you stay, Richard? Your Excellency, I fight only for pay not for my life. Oh, uh, well, that's too bad. - Hey, Jacques. - Uh, hello, Captain Warrington. - Has she returned yet? - No, captain. - Not a sign of her. - Peculiar. Perhaps it's just a lovers' quarrel. She may come back-- Lovers' nothing. She just shouldn't be running around getting people into trouble. If you hear word of her, report to me at the barracks. Certainly, captain. [women chattering] - Why, Captain Warrington. - Good morning. - Oh. - How do you do, captain? Listen, it's going to be gorgeous. It's really going to be lovely. Oh, do make it. Beg your pardon. Maybe I'll be able to go. - Thank you very much. - Oh, please, please come. ♪ Ship ahoy ship ahoy ♪ ♪ Who wants to marry a sailor boy? ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ♪ ♪ Once ashore once ashore ♪ Oh, Captain Warrington. - You like the marionette? - Yes, indeed, marionette. - Thanks. - One?

Bella mia, you are wonderful. Oh, I'll try and do better tomorrow. Oh, how can I ever repay you, Rudolpho? - You've been so good to me. - Ah. I needed it so. Well, you not have to work until tonight's performance. Maybe you go out and get something to eat. Yes. Yes, I'm, I'm starved. [humming] [Richard humming along] [humming] - Well, this is unbelievable. - Here, touch me. - It's true. - Will you get out? No, no, I don't desert my friends without an explanation. Why did you run away, blue eyes? Because you owed me three Louis? You'll get your money back just as soon as possible and with interest. I'm full of interest right now. Your presence here is most unwelcome. Or in other words, my presence would be most welcome somewhere else? - Yes. - Alright. If that's the way you feel about it. Will you get out of here and stay out? - But, uh-- - Oh. Oh, well, I thought-- Oh, you thought I'm Captain Warrington, yes? Well, yes, I did. Bella mia, if you wanna work here, stay here you keep away from Captain Warrington. - Oh, I certainly will. - Oh, that's a good bella mia. They say he make all girls in New Orleans lose their heads and then, then he break their hearts. - Well, not this girl. - That's what all they say. [scoffs] That, t-that's what they say? Uh-huh. - Hmph. - That's a good bella mia. You stay here, work for Rudolpho and keep away from Captain Warrington. Indeed, I will. It's your own fault. Remember, you said in there, my presence would be welcome somewhere else? Well, here I am. Welcome me. Ah, I've waited two days for that smile. - It wasn't a smile. - Pain? Stitch in your side? [both laugh] I thought you were a soldier. Haven't you anything better to do than follow me around town? Not today. Tomorrow I may go out to argue with your admirers from Barataria. - You mean-- - But today.. Yes. You remember the pretty lads who wanted to do a maypole dance with you and we interrupted? Oh, you know I never really thanked you for that. Well, you can. You haven't seen the town, have you? - Well, no, I-- - Come on. No more mention of our unpleasantness. Furthermore, you can trust me because I'll keep you out in the open from now on. - Oh, I-- - I thought you would. You're not mad, you're lonely. There now, why must you continually bring the subject back to love? Besides, I've so many new things to see and hear. Granted, but we can't escape it. It's everywhere, from the lowest to the highest. For example, even this noble shrimp was once capable of a sweet and tender love. Oh, well, it doesn't look very romantic to me. Yet I'm sure shrimps are very sincere. Yes, there's rather overwhelming evidence of it. Oh, look! Oh, there's the widow cottontail. She looks something like the old woman who lived in a shoe. Who had so many children-- Before she turned to stew. A bitter joke, ma'am. [chuckles] Terrible. Even cloven-hoofed Pan turns domestic. Poor Pan. So you put away your pipe to be a pauper, hm? I'll admit it's rather sour, his point of view. That's love. So we're still on the subject of love, are we? - Don't you like it? - No, I don't. Anytime I say anything you don't like you just cross your fingers and hold them up to me. - Like that? - Like that. - And you'll stop? - And I'll stop. Oh, look at the lovely flowers. Pick yourself a corsage or whatever they call it. - May I? - Mm. - Abraham, look. - Ezekiel, I'm looking. Oh, aren't they two of your men over there? - Uh, no, yeah, well.. - And they're eating too. Oh. Oh, come on, sir. How do you do? - Hello. - Howdy. [sniffs] It smells very good. - Right over this way, missy. - Oh, thank you. Why don't we go somewhere else? We'll only get the victuals of the country here. Onion soup, fried shrimp in butter and-- Oh, good. I'll take that. - Two. - 'Yes, sir, captain.' [slurping] See the lovely flowers Captain Warrington bought me? Lovely, aren't they? Squeeze the juice out of them things and it's mighty good when you get a boil on your neck. - Good for swollen feet too. - Uh, boys, uh.. That's wonderful. I haven't had those ailments yet but if I do get them, I'll remember your advice. Thank you both. Well, now that's right friendly, ma'am. May I pour you a drink? See, you take the jug this way crook it over the elbow and.. - There you are. - 'No, thank you, really.' It will put a natural curl in your hair, ma'am. - No. No, please, really. - Go on. This is good. Boys, do you mind plowing that field of corn somewhere else? Alright, captain. Oh, look. here's ours. - Smells good, doesn't it? - Mmm. And with what do we eat our friend, the shrimp? With nothing. I warned you. Oh, but, yes, with the first fork in existence. See? Ah-ha. [laughs] Mmm! Mm, good. [slurping] I always love the sounds of a big city, don't you? You can see, I usually have music at mealtime. Boys, please, wait a minute. I mean, do you mind going a little easier on those bass fiddles? - Oh. - Oh. Pardon me, ma'am. A female may get under a man's hide but when she gets in his food, I quit. Just a minute. Don't be forgetting your posies, Mistress Cramer. - Oh, thank you so much. - You're welcome, ma'am. [bell ringing] Oyez! Oyez! Five hundred Louis D'or reward is offered for the apprehension of Marietta Franini masquerading as a casquette girl from France 'by order of Gaspard d'Annard, governor!' Quickly, get behind the corner of the building. - I'll be right back. - 'I don't know. A ship arrived at the mouth of the river this morning. A courier arrived just ten minutes ago. If you want the 500, go get her. I remember her. They sent her from the convent. - Yes, the redhead. - With blue eyes. Yes, and I saw her this noon up at the marionette theater. - She's working there. - At Rudolpho's? That's it. You better get there fast before she hears about this. [crowd clamoring] (male #8) 'Oyez! Oyez! Proclamation! 500 Louis D'or..' I knew there was something about you. - What's it all about? - I can't explain-- Never mind. Let's get away y and talk it over. Don't you think you can trust me now? You're the only one I can trust. Come on, dear. [indistinct chatter] Now let me see. Why should a ship come hurrying from France? Why should they offer 500 Louis reward? All that for little Marietta Franini just a little, indiscreet girl from Marseilles. Oh, please, let's not talk about that now. All this will end soon enough as it is. Blue eyes, you're in trouble and I wanna help you. Yes, but you said a petticoat for any length of time was smallpox to the nerves. But I've only known you, really, in the last hour and I'm immune to smallpox and I haven't any nerves. Well, then just keep calling me Marietta or blue eyes, if you wish. At least I know you're not what you said you were. What do you think I am? Gardenia, maybe, that's lost in a field of mustard plants or a dove flying in a flock of crows or.. [chuckles] That's pretty clumsy, isn't it? - Oh, no. I like it. - Who are you? - Just someone. - Someone, huh? From somewhere. Well, I have a very strange feeling about someone. - No pain, I hope. - Mm-hmm. A very strange feeling I've never felt before. Dizziness too? And a kind of a grinding depression. - Oh, a sinking spell? - My heart's acting strangely. - It feels rather sore. - Oh, I'm sorry. At least it gives me that impression.

I mean, I, I mean, I knew it and I didn't know it. I mean, a song. I know it's a song, but I didn't know it I, I knew it, I don't know it and it's all very mysterious. It is. I mean, it was, but it isn't anymore. Well, this mixed-up little song of yours is it, is it as nice as mine? Well, it's more serious than yours. Everything. Would it be wrong if you sing it to me? Oh, no, it would be right. I couldn't sing it to anyone else. Oh, oh, w-where, where are you taking me? To our headquarters. Here we go. Watch it now. That's it. - Captain Warrington. - Well, major? This lady is Marietta Franini. That is neither denied nor agreed to. She can't deny it, nor can she deny that she is actually the princess de Namours de la Bonfain a fugitive from France, against His Majesty's wishes. A princess? Madame, I'm-- Oh, I, I'm still Marietta. Or blue eyes. (Bonnell) 'I've been ordered to escort you at once to the governor's' 'palace. His Excellency awaits you there.' I don't think the lady need go anywhere on your command. Captain Warrington, the governor's orders. If you don't wish to go, I have a sword here that will see that you stay. Please I'll go with you. I'll see you again, Captain Warrington. There is only one answer to that, which I believe you know. So the king mandate. Well, I guess that about settles it, doesn't it? Yes, then I should be settled in irons if I didn't carry it out to the letter. Well, I shouldn't want that, monsieur. But, my dear, why did you do it? I mean, the most important marriage of the century and Don Carlos must be a most loving suitor to have come here all the way with your uncle, so that-- When do they arrive? After nightfall, surely. They left by barge from the delta. They must have sailed a day or two after you did. Very well, I'll await them. And of course, there'll, there'll be a ball in your honor here at the palace tonight. Oh, that's quite unnecessary. Very kind of you, monsieur. Yeah, and, uh, madame, another matter and most important. We shall see to it naturally that your uncle and Don Carlos are not informed as to, uh what happened to you after you left the convent. Doesn't matter, really. Well, I, I thought perhaps Don Carlos might be needlessly upset. Why? If I wasn't upset why should it disturb him in the least? Uh, oh, yes, well, of course. But in any case, will you do me the favor of letting them believe that ever since you came here, you, you.. Well, blast it. What could you have been doing? I worked in the marionette theater. Splendid, of course, you worked at the marionette theater. See, then they need never know I went away to live alone. No. See, they'll never know. Or that you drove me to it. Oh, exactly, I.. Oh, uh, no, well, that's not quite the point. I-I-I mean, I-I-I-- (Madame d'Annard) 'Joseph, is the princess still with the governor?' (Joseph) 'Oui, madame.' Ah, madame la princesse, your apartment's ready. I hope you will bear with the humble hospitality here. We try to keep things from being too provincial. Everything seems most proper. Oh, Marietta, I've been expiring some horror about your experiences. Of course, if I'd had my spectacles with me I should have seen at once that you really weren't a casquette girl. Gaspard, of course, he's such a man's man. - You really must forgive him. - Oh, well. And now, my dear, I know presumptuous but I'm older than you are and you must confide in me. Let me mother you as it were. You, uh, spoke of my apartment. Uh, this way. Uh, yes, of course, this way. Gaspard, I hope you're not still considering apologizing in person? Uh, no, I, uh, uh.. Uh, June, John, uh, has the escort left for down the river? Yes, Your Excellency. Yes, well, tell Major Bonnell that I want to consult with him about the, uh, about the reception on the levee. No word from Captain Warrington? No, Your Excellency. Oh, well, he must be found at once, you understand? Wait, uh, when he's found, just give him this dispatch. Get a quill. Here, hurry. Here, let me see. Uh, uh, Captain Warrington, you and your men are herewith ordered to start for Barataria today. This is a command. And, Richard, in the name of heaven and our friendship, please obey it. After all, a woman is only a woman but a princess is-is-is.. Well, what is a princess in this case? - Quickly. Something impressive. - A barrel of gun powder, sir? Uh, splendid. Uh, a princess is, uh, two barrels of gun powder. And, and please, uh, understand that this is.. Does madame desire three or four curls this side of the head? Mmm-hmm. Uh, madame la princesse? Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I.. Would you like three or four curls this side of the head? - Uh, four, please. - 'Is that the fashion now?' We feel so behind the times over here. Not judging by your garment.. It's new from Paris this winter. Lovely. You're all so good to be imposed upon like this. It is an honor to be a lady-in-waiting, madame. To attend you especially. See them, they're arriving like flies to a plate of honey. Well, why not? There's never been such an occasion since the colony was founded. Will, uh, will everybody be there? (female #1) 'Everybody who has an invitation, madame.' (female #2) 'Everybody who is anybody.' And, uh, the officers? (female #3) 'All those of the regular guard, yes.' 'They've been invited to attend.' Of course, I don't know about Captain Warrington for instance. He isn't in duty bound to come. Still, he might. - Although he doesn't usually. - Oh, I see. (female #4) 'No, I tell you, you cannot come in.' Oh, please, madam, she knows me. Can I-- You goose, you are not permitted in this part of the house. (Julie) 'Oh, but please can I..' 'Will you please just tell madame my name?' Julie, where did you come from? Marietta, I mean, madame la princesse. A maid attached to the kitchens, madame. Well, see that she's transferred to my personal service, will you? Yes, madame, anything madame wishes. And, uh, may we be alone, please? - You don't mind, do you? - Not at all, Your Highness. Julie, what's the matter, darling? You're not in trouble? Oh, no, I just wished to see you. Oh, madame, I can hardly believe when I heard-- Marietta, Julie. But tell me, why are you here? Your-your nice young man? Oh, he's in the governor's service here. Well, you're happy, aren't you? Oh, terribly, but, but, Marietta, how about you? Well, I was happy until this happened. I don't know what it's all about. I hear so many stories. What do you hear? - About Captain Warrington. - What? I heard that the governor ordered him to leave town today but he hasn't gone and he's coming here tonight. Oh, Julie, Julie. [knock on door] Yes, come in. Get out. Wait in the bedroom, dear. If I were to treat you as you deserved you should be soundly thrashed. I refuse to descend to your level. Thank you, monsieur. You display the conduct and the behavior of a street cat. If you've no regard for yourself you might have some respect for our name. But I didn't use our name. I've no need to tell you what your conduct has cost me. The humiliation, that ghastly trip at sea. And poor Don Carlos suffered such excruciating misery from seasickness I almost despaired his life. - But he didn't die. - Fortunately not. - Sad. - Marie. Oh, hasn't he any pride? Doesn't he realize I loathe him? Doesn't he know I left France only to avoid having to marry him? He knows nothing of the kind. I persuaded him that your running away was a whim. That you wanted to intrigue him, to become more desirable. And if you're wise, you'll let that impression remain. We go aboard the boat after the reception tonight. - Tonight? - And sail at dawn. Oh, but, uncle-- Until that time, you are forbidden to leave the palace ground. The place is guarded. The men have their instructions not to let you pass. You may as well hear me out. I'm not going back with you. If you have any ideas like that in your mind you better dismiss it. And all about your affair with this, uh, Warrington. If he should try to see you again I shall regard it as an effort to help you to escape. He'd be tried for treason and shot. The king's mandate permits this. I shall see that it's carried out to the letter. Are you ready to go down? Well, I.. I must find my gloves. You heard? You must hurry to the barracks and tell him he mustn't come you understand? He mustn't. ♪ We march together ♪ - It's he, madame. - Oh, I know, I know. - What am I going to do? - Oh, Marietta. ♪ Tramp tramp tramp we march together ♪ ♪ Never minding wind or weather ♪ ♪ Tramp tramp tramp we march together ♪ I'm ready, monsieur.

Well, who's going to take care of your men? Her Highness, the Princess Marie de Namours de la Bonfain. His Highness, the Prince de Namours de la Bonfain. Where's Don Carlos? Well, he's not quite recovered from the motion of the boat. He'll join us later. I'm sorry. Madame la princesse, this is a great day for New Orleans. Thank you, madame. My children tell me that you have such a divine voice, Your Highness. Thank you. They heard you in the little theater. Oh, really? Such a quaint little escapade for our princess. Oh, yes. You are positive these stairs are not moving? Positive, monsieur. His Highness Don Carlos Duquette of Ista Bonita, Grandes de Espana. You see, I have followed you to the end of the Earth. Don Carlos. I think I had better sit down. Uh, uh, permit me, Your Excellency. Would you honor me, madame? Gaspard, the etiquette. Uh, oh, uh, uh, will you honor me with this dance, princess? Certainly. You two boys wait here till I come out. Alright, cap. You know what's the matter with him, don't you? - What? - He's in love. Oh. I thought you were ordered to Barataria. We were. We're camping at the mouth of the river tonight. - Then what are you doing here? - Going in. Weren't you sent to escort me? I was supposed to keep out anyone who hadn't an invitation. Well, I have an invitation, the best in the world. - From the princess herself. - I mean a written invitation. However, I'm going to make an exception in your case. We'll both make it together. I'm sure the prince will be very anxious to meet you. Allow Captain Warrington to go in. [instrumental music] Oh, oh, pardon. Uh, uh, oh.. - Beg your, beg your pardon. - Oh, I, uh.. Well, okay, here. Richard, you shouldn't have.. I told you.. I ordered you to leave town today-- Today doesn't end until midnight, Your Excellency. Well, I know, but you've got to, you.. Oh, uh, Richard, you can't..

You asked to see me again. - Well, I did want to see you-- - Then look at me. Well, it's just that I can't talk with you tonight with all these people here. Soon as they find I'm gone, they'll be out searching for me. Where is the princess? [coughs] Well, uh, oh.. You were dancing with her, weren't you? [coughs] Oh, uh, yeah. - Well, why did you leave her? - Uh, well, I.. [coughs] I'm not a very good dancer. I've got lump.. [coughs] - Wouldn't you like some punch? - Where is she? Uh, where, where is she? Oh. [mumbles] She, w-w-when I was, uh she was standing right here. [coughs] Oh, uh, where the.. [stammering] [coughs] Some, some.. Where? I can't. I.. Where's the song you were going to sing to me? Oh, please, this is a party given in honor of my sailing. I really should be in there-- What have they said about sailing? - Sailing? - Yes. When do they think they're going to try to take you away? Oh. Oh, we're not sailing until tomorrow night. I mean, the day after tomorrow. Uh, uh, I mean, Friday. - Friday, my uncle said. - Good. Then I'll be back right here tomorrow night to hear your song. Tomorrow night? We'll be camped only about 20 miles from here. I'll get back easily. Tomorrow night. Yes, that will be best. - Madame. - Oh, yes, uncle. Oh, oh, were you looking for me? - I-I'm sorry. - Major. - Isn't this the man who-- - Oh, well, of course, uncle. But after all, aren't we magnifying something very silly? Th-this, this officer saved my life and I, I simply asked him to come here and say goodbye to me. [chuckles] But thank you again, Captain Warrington and goodbye. Oh, uncle, don't look so cross. I believe you have come to your senses after all, my dear. Oh, oh, oh, well, I, uh.. Oh, no. Oh. For heaven's sake, why do you.. Go, run away, son. Uh, Richard, my boy, will you do me a favor? I'll be forced to-to-to put you up, uh against the wall and-and b-blow a kni-- You can do anything you like except cut off my ears. I'm saving them to hear something I never believed possible. Yes, well, you can keep your ears. But will you please get your hat and go? We've all vowed that we can't dance another step until we hear you sing, Your Highness. I perish at the thought of being denied. - Oh, please-- - Remember, Your Highness. - You promised. - Have pity on the provincials. Your Highness, we so seldom have an opportunity to hear a thing like that. Please, please, I.. Richard, please, I'm.. Oh, yes. Yes! Yes, I will sing, I will. Rudolpho, Rudolpho, play.

[sobs] Now leave me alone. Do you hear me? Leave me alone! [sobs] Dick. Oh. Oh. - Dick, how did you get here? - By the balcony stairway. - But the palace is guarded. - But I'm here. At least we can have this. I couldn't go away without telling you about the song. Our song, dear. Every step you went away you must have heard my heart calling you back. You wouldn't have sung it down there if you'd ever expected to see me again, would you? - No. - When are you sailing? Tonight. We leave in a few minutes. - Why didn't you tell me? - Oh, I couldn't. If you'd known, you never would have gone away. You'd have stood up against them all and.. ...I'd have only had to see you led away to be.. Well, do I want to live this foolish life if I can't have you? You are all I ever want, too, all there is. Then that's it! Quickly now, get a cloak. Oh, but we can't. The place is surrounded. I got in and I'll get out. Oh, but, my darling, don't you see? No matter where we go, they'd only find us again. Not where we're going, we'll lose ourselves in the west, otherwise. Oh, beyond the mountain. It won't be easy, it means the wilderness but if you're with me, we can make it a paradise. A new country, a new life together. Oh, yes. Yes! [knock on door] Marie, we're leaving for the ship immediately. Answer him. [knock on door] - 'Marie.' - 'Yes.' [knock on door] Marie, do you hear me? Warn the guard immediately. Yeah, use your gun butts. (male #12) 'Hold it!' Captain Warrington, you're under arrest. [pounding on door] - Oh, the guard! - Guard! Seize that officer and the princess. We have them. We have them, Your Highness. Guards, escort them into the governor's office at once. At once, Your Highness. Fall in. We know a longer way to the governor's office, captain. - Hutch! - Yes, through the woods.
