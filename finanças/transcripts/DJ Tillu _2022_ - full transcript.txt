My life has become fast and furious. Faster! -Fast, Tillu! -Hey, Stop! Go fast! It’s not a sports bike to go faster! Radhika! Tillu, go fast! Come on! Go! Where is my money? Where is Radhika? Where is my phone? Why are you crying? Huh? Why are you crying? How can you question me like that? He is lying unconscious on the hospital bed. How can you talk this way? Silly woman! He is safe in the hospital. If people like him roam on the roads they will beat him with slippers. What is this, Sir? How can you talk this way about your son in the hospital? Where can I begin? I named him after my favourite freedom fighter Bala Gangadhar Tilak. He changed it to DJ Tillu. What does your Tillu do by the way, Sir? What can Tillu do? He can talk tall. Hey… stop it, man! What happened? Don’t cry! What are you doing here? Why the hell are you here? This is my event. Have you come of age? Hey, I have come to play music, Dad. Don’t make a scene. Look! Act as if you don’t know me. Come. Hey, Mummy, why are you both here? She’s our Surekha’s daughter. Bloody! After going home I will sync your contacts with mine and avoid overlaps. I don’t like you getting into my professional space. Because work is work and friendship is friendship, Mummy. - Ok! I have to listen that! My day begins with his issues. Hmm. Mummy! One bullet coffee! -Getting it. -I am ready. Have some sambar! What is it? He put ghee in his coffee and is drinking it in the rest room. How can you add ghee to coffee? Are you mad? Oh, Daddy! Do you know what happens when you add ghee or butter to coffee? It burns all the fat here. What about the fat you drank last night? Come on, Dad! You question everything. Mom! Can you remove the yolk from four eggs and make an omelet with egg whites? Are you going to throw the yolk? Listen. Don’t be stingy and eat them. You will get piles. [humming] He goes gallivanting. Before that he bickers with our maid. He banters with the petrol pump attendant because he put two drops less of oil. Hm? He doesn’t even spare the barber. I just don’t get this. How can you expect an American style haircut from a barber in Malkajgiri, Sir? Paying through your nose for a tissue! Are you ready? Ready, brother. Huh? Huh. Check it once. -Shall I open my eyes? -Please open them. How is it, brother? Mahesh Babu’s picture is right here. You look at him every day! Highlights, man! It looks good bro! -Copper brown…Burgundy. Gold. -Hmm. -These are the three colours. -Hmm. You must use them in one layer and leave the other. Hmm? -If you use it for one and two, you must leave the third one. -Ok! If you use it for four and five, you must leave the sixth one. Seven, eight…nine. How can you become Mahesh Babu overnight, brother? So, you are laughing, Uncle? It’s fun, right? Lower your arms. The stink from your armpit is blocking my nose. Already, one nostril doesn’t function. No smell! It looks solid tight, brother. You seem to be hitting the gym. Oh! No, man! I have been on the keto diet. What did you say? Keto diet, man. Huh. -We don’t eat rice. -Hmm. We don’t eat potato. -Hmm. We only eat protein. And fat. No carbohydrate. You eat fat in your diet? Then? It’s the fat that goes in and cuts the excess fat. Come on, brother. Don’t pull my leg. Please. Hey, fool! How do you cut a diamond? Ah? Say it yourself. With a diamond. Huh? Umm. Really? Then with us… Lalaguda, Amberpet, Mallepally, Malakpet, “Everybody will dance at Tillu’s DJ ” “Like Mallesh bro’s party and like Pannu’s news” “People will rock if Tillu enters” “Dj Tillu’s style is another level” “He’s a hero at looks” “And plays folk beats” “Come on, Dj Tillu hit..!” “Hit badly as of like showing hell” “The fear of hearing Dj tillu’s name” “The dance floor will shiver if he step in” “Come on, Dj Tillu hit..!” “It’s a oath on me if you didn’t hit” “96” “09” “333” “222” “Call me any minute in the junction” “The name is Dj Tillu” “With his sparkling shirt and his frizzy hair” Tillu bro, greetings! Tillu bro! “If he smiles with perfume along with the frizzy hair” “Girls hearts will collapse” “You will be publicised by all the markets with competition” Hey, stop creating mess! Bro, it’s me DJ Tillu, some guys are creating ruckus here. “So what?” “Get lost man!” Hey! All set guys! Ok,ok! “Dj Tillu’s style is another level” “He’s a hero at looks” “And plays folk beats” “Come on, Dj Tillu hit..!” “Hit badly as of like showing hell” “The fear of hearing Dj Tillu’s name” “The dance floor will shiver if he step in” “Come on, Dj Tillu hit..!” “It’s a oath on me if you didn’t hit” What is your name? Marcus, Uncle. What do you do? I’m the sound engineer. For whom? For T..T..Tillu brother’s music band. You call this a band? He didn’t make a single rupee from it. Go on! Move! See ya, bro. -Bye! -See ya, bro. -What is your name? -Sriram, Uncle. What do you do? I am Marcus’ younger brother, Uncle. On my’ brother’s recommendation, I joined brother Tillu’s band to learn music. Are you not Christian? -No, Uncle. How does Marcus become your brother then? We gave my sister in marriage to Marcus’ uncle. Move on! Yo, yo. Bye, bro. -Scoot! -See you, bro! Who are all these boys? Do you understand what you are doing, Tillu? After graduation you said you would become a boxer like Muhammad Ali. Before a month passed, someone punched on your face and you came home crying. Fifty thousand lost! You were after business. I helped you set up an internet centre. Ah? Taking a policeman’s daughter there, you did all sorts of things ruining my reputation. On top of that I had to lose three lakhs. Now you it’s all about your yo yo music. Do you know anything? Tsk! What happened? What would he do with all the money? Is he going to take it to the grave? Don’t touch my money then. Use your own money! -I don’t have! -Calm down. -I don’t have single rupee on me. -Calm down. You are my father. So feed me. Otherwise, just throw me into the street. Don’t mess with me every day. I am a bit sensitive. Tillu! -Is that how you speak to your dad? -It’s not that, Mummy! How bad should I feel if he insults me in front of my friends? Actually- For the kind of following I have, Bablu is asking me to contest as youth leader. But I keep it aside and I concentrate on music. That’s the kind of dedication I have. Hey, Thoufiq! Why do you call me so many times like a loan shark? Which songs should I play here! What else do you play at ladies’ events? Open you tube, type Victory Venkatesh’s songs, play them, …they will sit quietly eat and leave. Hang up! Hey, Tillu! Hey, have your breakfast and go. It’s difficult to handle such boys, Sir. Get him married and send him away. Who will give their daughter in marriage to this fellow? Isn’t it? Or ask him to love someone and marry her. Since she falls in love after knowing him, she will be at fault. That episode is already over. Really? Hmm. Out of the blue, he met a fair girl and he instantly fell in love with her. -Ah? -Huh! At least when she sat in his lap within 10 minutes of meeting, he should know, right? Hi, everyone! So, tonight I thought of singing a song that none of you heard before. It’s song that’s been composed by a very good friend of mine. I really hope you guys like it. So, this is how it goes. “I looked into your eyes” “And forgot the world for a while” “You come into my dreams” “You breathe life into my heart” “Knowing you demands love” “Knowing you” “My every word is the sound of your name” “It’s euphoric” “You there” “and the moonlight around” “With your laugh resonating like a string” “Your gaze” “Like a boon” “Eyes filled with love” “You there” “and the moonlight around” “With your laugh resonating like a string” “Your gaze” “Like a boon” “Eyes filled with love” Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Tillu. Great singing! Great! -Thank you. -I am a DJ by the way. Nice. I am Radhika. Nice name. Thank you. Umm. You want to go to my table? We have whisky and chilli chicken. Please come. -I drink vodka but… -Oh, sure. So! Hmm! Mr DJ Tillu! Hmm? Which club do you play for? Ugh! I don’t play for clubs. They are all so stupid. I play for Mankalamma fair, Bonalu and sari functions. It’s full of scratch. Next year, I am going to do a film with Bunny. Hm? Bunny? Hmm. Allu Arjun? Then? Actually we met at a common friend’s birthday party. Recently I have put up a song titled DJ Tillu. Have you seen it? It’s a blockbuster. He listened to it. He went crazy. He said, ‘Hey, Tillu, I need something like this.” I asked him to use it. He said, give me a new one. So I gave him the new one. Interesting. How come I never heard your name? I told you. I maintain a completely low profile. Low profile? Wearing this jacket? Sure. You know they show this in the movies. Some guy falls for a girl and when she leaves him, he gets to the streets like a crazy man? You are a heart-breaking machine, Radhika. What’s running on your mind? There is no one in the club right now. Only we both are here. Hmm. What if I suddenly try to kiss you? I will slap you and ask you, “Do I look available?” That was my doubt number one. Hmm. Doubt number two? What if I think- Why mess it up? Let me sit quietly in a corner? I would think he is such a bore. A loser. That was my doubt number two. Hmm. So? So…. On behalf of all men, I ask you this. What to do by men? Unmindful of what others might think, you must do what you feel like. One…two….three…four… How many moles do you have? Sixteen. Hmm. Sweet sixteen? Where do you have them? You will know. What’s the hurry? What did you have for dinner? Huh? For dinner? Biryani. Crap! Where is my mouth freshener? It’s ok, love. Hey! How can you kiss me without my permission? How is that a problem now? Huh? Do you have a boyfriend? Hey! You are making me go insane hitting me. Do you have a girlfriend? If I do, she would be here by now. Shit, shit, shit! The wine shops must have closed. These guys have come here. Hmm. That was interesting. Umm…I can’t find my phone. Can you give me a call from your phone? Go home and look for it. Bye. If I go to the club asking for a singer for a baby shower at my home, …they will give me your number! Hello! Hi baby! -I will be late today and I had my dinner. -‘Hey Rohit! Come on darling’ I will reach at mid-night. Hey, shh… Have your meal and go to bed, okay? Ok, good night! Love you, bye! “Hey, rocking boy!” “You are a rocking boy” “It’s a beautiful girl!” “She is a crazy beautiful girl” “Shaking your lazy heart” “Is the DJ playing?” “Your mind seems to waver” “Your heart seems to race” “Life slipped into confusion changing your status from Single” “As the fire brand girl caresses you” “The fire brand girl makes your heart dance” “The fire brand girl seems to straight away” “Have found a niche in your heart” You’re suppose to be professional. You ruined, if you trust him. Don’t you dare! He’s a such a wonderful music director but why are you talking like that. Nonsense! One year back i went for singing audition, then he asked me to come to his guest house. Is it? “On the paths that your walk together” “Colours seem to paint the shadows” “Like the dancing tiger at a fair” “Feelings rise looking at her waist” “The heart slips and falls” “Hey, rocking boy!” “You are a rocking boy!” “It’s a beautiful girl!” “She is a crazy beautiful girl” “Shaking your lazy heart” “Life slips into confusion changing your status from Single” “As the fire brand girl caresses you” “As the fire brand girl makes your heart dance” “The fire brand girl seems to straight away” “Have found a niche in your heart” See… sending some more! Who’s this joker? Did you two guys have fun? Did you have fun? Huh? You think I didn’t know, Rohit? I have been waiting for eight months. Waiting for you to tell me. Radhika! I lost interest in you. That is why I am keeping that rich, Purnima.’ I'm done with you, Rohit! I want to spend my life with Tillu. I love him. Oh! Now you love him? Huh? No, you can’t. No! I don’t give a damn! Give a duck damn then, ya. Oh God! Bless him. Hmm. Stop all these vows and adorations. Why? How many times did I tell you not to send him out for food? Why did I throw a party at home today? Is it because he is an Abdul Kalam? Or because I have excess money? Sir, what happened, Sir? Why do you even ask? My son’s every birthday is a big headache for me and a huge problem. Why, sir? You know what happened last time? He came to me with a couple of his friends. -So? He said it’s my birthday today. I want to give my friends a party. So give me money. I refused to give him. His two friends along with him and stole two lambs, Sir. Huh? Then they tried to sell them to a mutton shop. Huh! The mutton shop guy identified them and chased these boys with a knife. -Oh my! -You know what he did this time? -Huh! -He talked of a girl. -Hmm. He said he is in love. He said he wants to marry her. He said she will come home. -And then he himself went to her house. -Hm? Hey, Tillu! Why isn’t she here yet? He wants to go to sleep. What is he going to do sleeping? Dream big? Ask him to stay up. Hey, Tillu! Hey, Tillu! -Mutton is not cooked properly. -Then don’t eat. Go! Hello! Ah, Tillu, tell me! Radhika, how long have I been waiting? Sorry, Tillu. Happy birthday. On the phone? Hey! Come home. My mom and dad are waiting to meet you. It’s difficult today, Tillu. I can’t make it. Oh? Ok. Let me cancel the party then. -Mummy! -Tillu! Tillu! -What is it, Radhika? -Tillu, please. I have some urgent work. I will take care of all that, Radhika. It’s my birthday today! Don’t I count even so much? Ok, Tillu. Come home. Come fast! Please. Hm! Let me go. -Hey! -Hey! Hey baby, let’s go for a date! Hey! Hey, hey! Committed! I am committed. Hello! Sir, sir! Yo, bro! Sign here. Tear it out and keep it. It will become an autograph soon. What’s up, baby? Why are you so late? Because a policeman caught me for over speeding. I was driving at 120. He recited lots of rules and asked for 500. I gave him a thousand. Guess why. Because I would return at the same speed. That’s how it works. I’ll use the washroom. Too much beer ah! Tillu! Tillu! Hey, bro! Flush is not working. Use the bathroom in the bedroom. Ok. What else do I and a boozer do? We piss and we miss. (Humming) ‘DJ Tillu’ (Humming) Hey, Radhika! Who is in these pictures? Is it your younger brother? He looks good. Very smart. Hey, brother-in-law! I never saw you. I didn’t even see him in photographs. Where did you hide him? How come so many photos all over house all of a sudden? Hey! So you are right here? I didn’t notice. Hey, brother-in-law! Are you drunk and passed out? What, Radhika? Have you both partied without telling me? Hey, brother-in-law! Hey…! Get up, get up! Let’s go out. It’s my birthday today. Hey, get up! Oh my! Radhika! Radhika! Hey, boy! Get up! Radhika! Radhika! Radhika! Open the door. There’s someone over there. Hey, boy! Get up! Hey, boy! Open the door, Radhika! What is happening? Open it, bloody! Open the door! Tell me, Tillu. There is a gentleman here. Don’t know whether he is dead or alive. Open the door! Why did you lock me in? Tillu! Because you will scream like this. Hey! What do you expect? Should I clap over the corpse? Tillu! Tillu! Please calm down. Please. Please someone would hear. Please. Ok? Radhika! I mean is this a prank you planned for my birthday? No, Tillu. If you did, please let me know. I can’t handle even a joke on me. I have such a delicate mind. Now this is too much to handle. Please! Open the door. I will open the door. Just calm down. I am calling up the police. Let it be, Radhika. Go to hell. Tillu!Tillu! Hello, control room! Tell me! Hello! Hello! Who is speaking? Hello! What’s the problem? Hello! Hey, hey! Tillu! Wait! Tillu! Wait! Stop! Tillu, Tillu! Just once. Just once…listen to me. Tillu, please! -What can you say? My foot! -Hear me out! Tillu! Please! Tillu! Tillu! That door won’t open. Why not? I have locked it myself, Tillu. Am I stuck here for the night? Am I celebrating my birthday here? Huh? You, me and a dead body? Take a look at this, Tillu. Who shot this? Why do you stand like a statue? He did it. What do you mean by ‘he’? Your servant? Or your village guy? Is he your milkman? Huh? Who is that good looking gentleman? But- Before you answer this crucial question- Radhika! Don’t say he is your boyfriend. Please? [DOOR BELL] Go inside. Go inside. -No, no, please. I can’t go inside, please! No Tillu! Go in quickly, please. You have a dead body here and whom did you call? Whom? You called the police, didn’t you? Oh my! -Hey! -Hi! Since last year, Rohit has been dating another girl. I came to know only the other day. I felt like killing him. That job is already done. The only job now is to bury him. Will you do it? But he doesn’t know that I know. But I am already aware of it. Hey! A big mafia job is going on here. -I can’t help… You don’t know that he knows. I don’t know you were here. You don’t know I am here. I will take care! If there is someone who is aware of everything, it’s our national award winner Radhika sister. If we don’t stop her, all of us will get very close to God. We are already there. It’s a secondary thing. Has he left? Huh? Oh my! I moved round the house as if it were Ocean Park! I don’t know where my finger prints have landed! I must erase them. Tillu! You can’t wipe finger prints with tissue. Why don’t you give me a kerosene tin then? Tillu! -Please listen to me. -What should I listen to? Tell me. What do you want? How unfair! You locked me in like Bigg Boss house refusing to let me go unless I finish the task! Huh? You are a number one cheat. (Sobbing) Ok. Don’t cry. What have I said now? You should understand even I am shocked by murder. I should digest it, right? I am sorry, baby. Ok, don’t cry. Stop, crying. Please. Wipe your face. -Let us go straight to the police station -Huh? Let us go… We say he was about to attack you. In self-defence you had- I have one small doubt. Did all this happen in self-defence? I hope this wasn’t a cold-blooded murder? No, Tillu. I promise. Why don’t we go then? Let’s go and explain. Tillu, don’t keep saying police, Tillu. Please! Why are you scared of the police? Huh? Are there any old cases against you? Hey, tell me if there are. I won’t mind. I can handle only one pressure at a time. I can’t handle multiple pressures like this. After we go to the police station if I find out you are a wanted criminal, I will drop dead on the spot. I have a delicate mind. Yes, Tillu. I committed forty murders. They have been trying to trace me for 5 years. Hey… Hey, don’t say that please. You frighten me. I have been telling you not to call the police. Issue will be blown out of proportion. Both of us will be in soup. Huh? You don’t get it. -You keep repeating police- -One minute… One minute. Let us take one step back. Hm! You just said both of us will be in soup. Right? I mean, why will I be in soup? How am I connected? I didn’t even know he was there. Tillu! We don’t know where he might have stored our photos. And- This building has CC TV cameras. When people die they dance in front of the corpse, right Radhika? I did the dance downstairs and then came up. You have a dead body at home and CC TVs all over the building …and still called me as if for a festival! I came running powdering my face! That’s how it is with me. You have trapped me so good! Tillu’s birthday special is Tillu’s ceremony. Leave, Tillu! Go away! Just four hours back I told my boyfriend that I like Tillu. That I will marry Tillu. I imagined a family with you, Tillu. All this happened because of that. I have never seen such a suitcase before. Hey! -What are you doing? -Don’t worry. Wait. Casually. Ok? Such a small trip! How well you have packed! Ladies! Hello! Sign in the ‘out’ entry. Ok. Ok, Tillu. Tillu baby! Calm down. Calm down. Ok! If we say we committed the murder- Shh! Don’t say ‘murder’ aloud, Radhika! Ok, ok. Ok, baby! Ok, ok. Let me handle this. Ok. Hm? What is this careless behaviour? Savitri! You take this for the cheap material your mom uses? There are all glass items inside. Belgium… These people! Pen! Huh? Do you have tissue paper? Tissue? What for? I sweat under my neck. Oh! Ok. When you planned a murder, you should have also planned a proper costume. You can’t lift a suitcase. But you hit the gym every day. That’s for weight lifting. Not for corpse lifting. Lift. Ok. Lift. Lift it! Bloody! Are you going to lift it holding the tyre? Ok, lift it. He has put on weight like a bandicoot. Push! Tillu! Where are we going now? Definitely! Not to club, Radhika! Why did you stop here? Because there is a process involved in burying a body. We need some elements for it. Like a crow bar, spade etc. We get them here. You call this a hardware store. You must have never stepped into such a store in your life. Shall I tell you where you go? Pubs, malls, Bistro…café, …what else? Ah…lounge S..D Help… You…I beg you. Talk as little as possible, Radhika. I am feeling a typical anxiety when you talk. Hey, there is a boulder. Watch out! I have one suggestion for you. Hmm? Sit in the car, switch on the AC, open the Swiggy app, order water melon and relax. There is no contribution in this nasty job and on top of that you keep making corrections. Huh! Please! Go and relax! I am used…to burying bodies. I do this every day. I will finish this and come. What does he do? Software? Photography. He was a cameraman for two films. It’s very unfortunate this has happened. He is also quite young. He will never see success because of you. Hmm? Hmm? Two. Round two. Get the crowbar. Get what? That long iron rod that you have put in my ass! Please get it. You changed my life overnight. My hands touched nothing but the DJ console. You made me carry a corpse. Tillu! Please! DJ! DJ Tillu! Ok. Don’t come up with all that. They are all lip service. Go! What is it? I love you. Shh! Please be silent. Huh! -Will go,Radhika -Tillu! Hear me out. -Will go,Radhika. -Get down from the car. Who are you, bro? Dectective! Chandrakanth. Who sent you? Don’t you know? Is it Rohit? Rohit. When did you last speak to Rohit? Two minutes ago. One minute. One minute. Who sent you now? Huh? Who sent you? Rohit. You seem to have clarity. Rohit. Sister? Hey! The guy we buried. Huh? -Why do you say that in front of him? -He is trying to scare us with a video. In which you are not there, by the way, only I am there. Point number two- Why should we fear him like going to a red light area and be afraid of red? Tell me. Rohit. Huh? Rohit! You have some clarity. Ok. I have some clarity. The point is- I have buried someone. I don’t know whether his name is Rohit or Lohit or Mohit. Don’t glare at me. I don’t know. What do you want? 25 lakhs. Sister, give it to him. Hm? Please. Give it to him and release me from this scam now. We need to talk for 2 minutes. Wherever we talk it’s the same nonsense. Tell me here. Move. Tillu! Tillu! Tillu! Listen! Look! This guy is taking us for a ride. Don’t trust him. Don’t trust him at all. Okay? Is this your plan? Hmm? You, this Chandrakanth and, …cameraman Rohit Kumar, who we don’t know if dead or not… You are all partners, right? Tillu! Please! Swear on God and tell me is it Rohit’s body that I buried? I don’t even know whose body I buried. That’s how it is with me, Radhika. Tillu! 25 lakhs. Same time tomorrow. Same place! Tillu! Listen to me once, please! Tillu! Ok! Ok! I have a plan. Huh? Where are we off to? Club! Look! The dead guy is your boyfriend. You committed his murder. Why are you making me follow you like Tommy? Tommy? Then what? You made me follow you like a puppy as long as you wanted. Now you got me into a murder case. Someone blackmailed you and you say someone else would pay. He is a rich Tommy. I am a poor Tommy. That’s all. Why are you coming along? Go away then. Remember. You are also in the video. Only I am in the video, dear! You are not even there. The girl in black sari could be you or Katrina Kaif or Bhumika Chawla. But the guy digging there is Tillu! Shh.. The club owner is Shannon. Shannon is into all kinds of deals. Antique idols like in ‘Swami Rara’. He is crazy about them. I have seen it myself. People go into his bedroom with money. Why are you in his bedroom? To use the washroom. Do all the men drinking at this pub get into Shannon’s bathroom, …unzip and piss there? Tell me? Tillu! Everyone knows Shannon is interested in me. He tried three, four times. Oho! I will set it up. Please trust me. Hit me, baby! Will you burn me with a cigarette? It’s a pleasure getting beaten by you. Hit me! Hit me! Hit me, baby. Break my head with that bottle. Hit me hard, baby. Call out my name and hit me. Shannon! Shannon! Shannon! Call my name and hit me. Hit me from the top! Remove…remove…remove. Remove quickly. You said you would set something up and now playing mom and dad with him? Tillu! Why did you come up? I told you I will set things, right? It’s all pressure for me and pleasure for him? Radhika! Huh? Who is this guy? Who is he? Tillu! This is no time to get emotional. There is money in this room. Do you want it or not? I will give you the money. Baby! Come here. Come. Baby! Radhika! I must slap myself with a slipper for being in love with someone like you. Radhika! Duck this cheap guy! -You…crazy! -Hey! Radhika! Who is this guy? What is happening here? Huh? -What are you doing with all the cupboards empty? -Tillu! Sister? Please! Calm down! Don’t calm me down. Stay at the door and make sure no Jacky or Rocky comes in. Hey! -Oh, no! Hey, Radhika! Tillu! Please! Hey! Ah? What are you doing here man? Hey! With all this set up and den- Are you making blue films? -With all this around? -Look! -Tillu! -Sister! Can we do this calmly? Calmly. Please? -You keep calming me down. -Please… Hey, hey, hey! -That’s my favourite gun! -Hey! Hey!!! I… -I don’t even know how to shoot, man. -No! Tillu! Hey! Gun! -Don’t touch it! That’s a limited edition. -I am coming to you. -What are you doing? -Hey! What shall I do with you? Shall I call your name and hit you? What is his name? Shannon. In full? Umm…Shannon Gonzales. Gonzales? Did you go and meet his parents also? Tillu! Shannon! Shannon! Shannon! Oho, Tillu! Why do you beat him with a gun instead of threatening? I am not as big a criminal as you, Radhika. I wouldn’t know. Would I? Stories! Huh? Tell me! Tell me. Money. Money! Mummy! -Huh? -Mummy! Mummy! -Money! What shall I do if you call your mom? Mummy…? -Tillu! -Money! -Mummy! -Where is money? -What? -Egypt Mummy! Huh! Who took you to Egypt? Which Tommy did you go there with? -Who did you go with? -It’s in seventh class history. It’s not history. You seem to be a big mystery. That’s not money! Hey… That’s not money! Hey! I will kill you! Oh god! Radhika! You cheat! You cheat! Cheaters! Radhika…. Tillu! Nothing has happened there as you think. How do you know what I would think? I just wanted to take the keys! Leave it, Radhika. Did I ask you for an explanation? About what is what? I didn’t. I have completely surrendered to you. Leave it. -At least, why don’t you hear me out? -Ok. Tell me. You are getting sadistic pleasure making a fool of me. I get it. Let it be! No problem. Even I want your happiness. Continue. Please! Ok. I went upstairs to ask for money. You did. He promised to help. -But slowly he began approaching me. -Beautiful! No. I wanted to pretend to consent and come away with money. Why did you tie his hands to the bed then? I loved you wholeheartedly, Radhika. I know, Tillu. In spite of knowing, you are making me a fool. So sweet of you! Hello! Tillu? Who is this? Yes, this is Rohit. Ok! Ok! Tillu, Tillu, please! -I am not able to handle, Radhika. -Calm down. Tillu! Please. Tillu! Talk to me, please. Calm down. Rohit! You mean Radhika’s boyfriend? Hey! What happened? He put my call on hold? He is confused. Didn’t you plan this part properly, both of you? These are all beginners’ mistakes. How professional you should be when you cheat someone? You should pull the wool over eyes in a blink. Tillu is an affair. Rohit must be the original boyfriend. He appointed a detective to handle this affair. When they killed the detective and were burying him, I spotted them. Oh my! This is the scheme. ‘Now you see me.’ Sorry. I got another phone call from US. Software. It’s ok, Mr Rohit. How is your company doing? Any update? Why use English? We are coming with money. Keep the video safe. Don’t show it to all like a new film. I beg you. Will get know, shortly! Hm! You know what is the biggest highlight of this whole highlight, Radhika? You make a mess and then you get angry! Shit! Have you ever loved me for real, Radhika? Or are you just using me? You know what your problem is, Tillu? If you stop looking at me like that , you’ll understand. … if I have feelings or not. Don’t talk as you like, Radhika. You are not going anywhere. -Tillu, you are hurting me. How can you call yourself wrong? -Leave. -Ah? -How can you say that? -Tillu! You are hurting me! Hey, Fish! Stop the vehicle. (Humming) DJ Tillu! Who’s this person? Wow! What a beauty! Hey, Fish! Give me a face mist! Wow! Why are you harassing her? No! No harassment, Sir. My name is Tillu, Sir, From a very good family. Actually we had an argument. Detective- Hmm? Detective? What could be the problem between you and a detective? Radhika! It’s not like that. By detective I didn’t mean that way… Hey, Tillu! Why are you threatening her? Hm…no, sir! First of all, do you know him? Radhika, don’t mind what I said earlier. These things happen, please. Radhika! Radhika! This is not the time for revenge. Tell him, Radhika. -Hey! -Say yes! Hey, come. -Hey, come. - Brother, one minute. One minute. -Radhika! Radhika! -Hey, come. Hey, Radhika! Why are you silent? -Hey, pull him! -Radhika, tell them you know me. She is my girl, bro! Don’t act smart! -Radhika! She is my girl. Hey! Radhika! What did I do, Radhika? Why are they taking me? Brother, please! -At least say I am your brother, baby! -Hey, move! -Or say we are neighbours. -Move! Say something, Radhika. -Move! They are taking me! Hey! Wait! What is your tension, man? Hey! How much did Mr Rao take in the murder case? Thirty lakhs. Thirty lakhs. -How much did he give us? -Fifty thousand. Fifty thousand. Tell him, man! If he has some illegal cases, let him handle. Ask him not to bring them to us. Do we look like beggars? Crazy! Sir! Tell me what you want. There is someone over there. Hm? What do you want? I want him. Him? Why do you need this guy? Take him. What do you mean take him? Ajay! When the Head Constable arrests me, it is your responsibility to take me to jail. Are you Kasab? -Waste of space with you in jail. -Please, sir! Take him. What do you mean waste of space? I will go with you to the jail. -Take him. Go on, man! He’s aiming! -Sir, I don’t want to go with them, Sir. -Move! -Sir! Where is my money? Huh? Jack, Radhika has done all this. I have no idea. I didn’t even know you were there. I mean I knew she had friends. But I never expected them to be good looking and charming. You both are friends, right? She is my ex man! I know. I know, Jack. There is something here. I know! I don’t believe only friendship happens with a good looking boy. Where is my money, man? It’s on the Kajaguda main road. You left two crores right on the road? Why do you act like a crack Jack? Did you sniff chick pea flour thinking cocaine? Radhika is there. You trusted Radhika? She is your ex. Isn’t she? She is a big cheat, man! What are you saying, Jack? Are you insane? We are at the location. Stop here. Stop over there.. Hey! It must be here. Where is the car? -Huh? -It must be here. Where is Radhika, man? Where is Radhika, man? She must be here. Is she drowned? Huh? Go and bring her! Bring her! 2 crores! Where is my money, man? Where? Huh? Where is my money, man? Radhika! Brother Jack! How do you know, Radhika? She’s my ex! What do you mean by ex? Ex means girlfriend, man! I liked the girl and flirted with her. We had fun. We had lots of fun! What do you mean by fun, Jack? Fun? Sex, man! (Sobbing) Wait, wait, wait. My car. My car is there. That’s my car. Car is yours. I am the thief. That’s what my life has become. Is it there? I can’t find it! Shit! Are you acting funny? Not at all, bro. Tillu! Huh! Please come here once! Jack! One minute. I need to talk to her for five minutes personally. Why? Because your reasons are financial but mine are emotional. Please. If you want your money, I have to talk to her for five minutes. Where did you disappear, Radhika? You didn’t care when the police was arresting me. I am roaming like a crazy man for you all over the city. Tillu! That policeman came to my house to drop me. Hm! And? Can I use the bathroom? You should have told him. That you have plumbing issues and the flush is not working. I can use a bottle instead. And? Is this ketchup? Blood…has he seen the blood? What did he do after that? This guy in the picture… The one who got arrested… This blood…. Saying he’s a detective! You are used to all these things. Will you go to jail or will you share the bedroom with me twice a month? I acted as if I agreed, …and I tied him to the bed. I got his phone, to be in a better place. One minute. I have one doubt. Have you previously done some work involving dogs? What? Then how did you develop this habit of tying up people, Radhika? What could I do if he was pouncing on me? Do nothing. Don’t tell me anything. Because your romantic fantasies are none of my business. It’s your personal matter. Tell me whether our video is there or not. It is there. Are you sure? Or are you taking me for a ride again? Because you are always doing that. It is definitely there, Tillu. What is this? There is no charging, Tillu. It’s in the same phone. Something is always amiss. Now there is no charging. Hey! Money! Where is his money? He is following me like a Doberman. It is here. What do you mean it is here? Where exactly? How much? How much did you pay him? How much is left? You must account for it, right, Radhika? Are we talking two rupees here? Two crores. Everything is there, Tillu. If everything is here, what did you give to Chandrakanth? I didn’t give him anything? If you didn’t give him anything, why did he give you the video? Why are you playing games with me, Radhika? Why is it so difficult for you to believe me, Tillu? Are you really asking me this question, Radhika? Yes, Tillu. Tell me. Tell me! The way I am offering explanation to you! That is the second highlight of the night. But still I will tell you because I am crazy. You say the policeman noticed the blood at home. I was scared. But I believed you. Then you say you tied him to the bed. I lost my faith. Sorry. Now you say he gave you the video. I am in such a situation, I had to believe you. Then you say you didn’t pay him a single rupee. I am thinking that is not how blackmail works. I lost my trust again. At every junction, it’s a suspicion. Instead of all these, Radhika! The bedroom visual I saw in Shannon’s bedroom. Hit me, baby. Break my head with the bottle. Don’t feel bad but the weight is more on the visual side, Radhika. It has disturbed me a lot mentally. Psychologically. If possible, Radhika, two things. One: Once we are married, let us not discuss this night ever again. Two: Stop wearing black saris. Don't ever wear black again. It’s haunting. Need some alone time. Hey! Where is my money? It’s in a hotel nearby. Let's go! Hotel? What hotel now? Marcus! Tell me. Where are you? Biryani is getting cold, brother. Am I in a mood to eat biryani, Marcus? I am roaming here with bones in my neck. What do you want now? Why are you talking to me like that? Your dad is waiting without eating. -But you… -Ok. Thank you. So sweet of him. I don’t know what you are saying brother. Convey something to my Dad. Huh. We may have differences of opinion on life, but I like him a lot. Please convey to him. Where are you, bro? What are you doing? What should I say, Marcus? There is a piece of land. I thought it was mine Very personal. But now everyone seems entitled to it. What can we do? I am going to a hotel for the settlement. Hotel? Do they serve biryani? Of course. I will eat my fill and come. Don’t ask me questions. I will come up with the truth. That’s how it is with me. -Hang up. -Bro! Tillu! How long? I am coming. Sweet talk and nasty deeds! Move! Don't touch the steering. Move! What happened? My car… Uh oh! So, will you follow us? Ah? Do you trust me? No. Why don’t you get in then? Why are you acting tough? Radhika! Hmm? We have done a song recording, right? Rap song? Is its audio- Video… Is everything in fine form? Our output and all? Oh! Hmm. Umm… -Huh? -Yeah. Hmm. It is in the phone itself. -The output. -It is there right? -Yeah. -Ok. -Hey! -Ah? You both are talking about me in the code language, aren’t you? Are you Pablo Escobar that we talk about you 24/7? You have a chocobar face! Hey! -What? -What, man? -Huh? -You flicked my money and… Yours…of course yours. Do you want the money or not? Yes! Ah? -Hey! -Ah! -Hm! -Huh? What? Radhika! This is a policeman, right? Why is he shooting at us? Move…move. Go! Go! -Go! -Hey! Leave me! He is here! Hey…! Tillu! Quickly! Quickly! -Move it, move it! -Let’s go, fast! -Go, Tillu! Go, go! -Let’s go, fast! Go, go… Stop it, man. Radhika! Give back my phone! She is a big criminal. She is bringing us all the issues in the city. Hey, Shannon! Mind your tongue. Why should I be courteous to her? She is a big criminal. Huh! Shit! -Huh! -Hey! What the heck! Look! Oye! That’s not a toy! Bloody hell! He’s coming. Go, go… Radhika! -Go… -Give me the phone back. Faster! Fast, Tillu. -This vehicle has not been designed for a chase purpose. -Go fast! Tillu! Go fast! Come on! Go. Hey…. [voice overlapping] Hey, hey, hey! Move aside! Move aside! Move, move… Come on! Bomb! Tillu go! He is almost here. I will kill you! Hey! Just get inside! Victory! Victory! Eureka! You crazy! Shannon Gonzalves! You can’t mess with me. Hey…. Hey! If anyone speaks ill of you, I will push them over the fly over! That’s how it is with me. Our video is not in this, Tillu. Who am I, Radhika? Am I the main candidate? Or a side candidate? Who is the policeman? Why is he shooting at us? Why is his phone with you? Shannon calls you his Ex. He is talking about sex. The guy who died by himself, he says he is Rohit Kumar. If he is Rohit Kumar, what about our song recording? Why only my performance is visible there? My life has become fast and furious. Do you realise? If you want to frame someone, find a rich guy. What do you get by framing me? I have nothing except music. Whatever the issue going on here I should know it clearly. Because you escaped the police by tying to bed. Why did Chandrakant return mobile without taking money ? Tell me that first. Video? Money? I told him money was in the car. He said the mobile was at home. Give me my video and take your money. What’s in money, Madam? Great looks. You’re looking gorgeous. -Ice cream.. -Please! Let’s enjoy lots. [Scream] I hit him on his head, took the phone and left. Tillu, why bother about all this now? Tillu, we have two crores hard cash. As long as we have the phone, we are safe. Let us use these two and get our video, Tillu! Please, think smart this one time. We can do anything with such a lot of money. You can produce your own music video. Life gets set, Tillu. Huh? This is like inviting two more problems to solve one, Radhika! And about money- I will play DJ and make it, Radhika. Every great artist’s life has changed with one song, Radhika. Check out anyone. Honey Singh, Sid Sriram, Michael Jackson, DJ Tillu. You are in a fantasy, Tillu. So, basically according to you, I am not going to become a successful person. I have zero talent then. You said it. If we give them the money and phone, what’s the guarantee that they will set us free? Even after handing over, if we stay here, we will have to live in fear, Tillu. Let’s go, Tillu. Please. What do you mean let’s go? Are we returning from a zoo or something? I have a family here, bro. I have my mom, dad and everyone. I have a life here! You don’t seem to get it! You keep harping about leaving. Why don’t you go? Go! Leave the phone and the money. I will take care of the issue. Hello, Shannon! Who the hell are you? It’s Tillu here. Hey! Where are you, man? Hey! Listen to me! Your money and phone are in Hotel Sitara, Room No. 202. Go and collect it! Radhika! Radhika! “I looked into your eyes” “And forgot the world for a while” “You stay in my dreams” “You breathe life into my heart” “Knowing you demands love” “Knowing you” “My every cell carries your name” “It’s euphoric” “You there in the moonlight” “Your laughter resonates like a string” “Your gaze like a boon” “Filling eyes with love” “You there in the moonlight” “Your laughter resonates like a string” “Your gaze like a boon” “Eyes filled with love” His brain is badly injured in the accident. We tried our best. But he slipped into a shock induced coma. Hi, Tillu! This is Bunty. Bunty is your friend. If you feel depressed or lonely, you shouldn’t cry. You must share it only with Bunty. Ok? What is he saying? Hi, Bunty! There is someone behind the door. Oh my! What is this, Tillu? Why are you acting mad? Who is there? How can you see someone none of us can see? Madam! Please don’t talk to the patients in a derogatory way. What is that? I mean… Don’t look down upon them, Sir. Er… That… How is your son? They said they will discharge him in a week. We will take him. How is he? Has he woken up? Yes, he did. He is playing volley ball now. Go and note the score. Nice joke. Do you want me to talk to the boy? What will you talk to him? What can you talk to someone who forgot his past? What happened? He lost his memory. He had a blow to his head. He is coming over. They have come again. Look! See! The mind of a patient who forgot his past is like a blank paper. It becomes red or green based on the pen you use, Sir. What pen shall we use to write now? It’s not like that, Sir. A patient with a traumatic injury is prone to illusions. We got to be stringent with him. Doctor! I want to tell you something in all sincerity. Please! Ever since we came to this hospital, I couldn’t understand a single word you spoke. Really? Shall we do something? Can you go and send a Telugu speaking doctor here? It’s not that, Sir. He is my first patient. You mean? Are you practicing on my son, Doctor? What are you doing? What happened, Uncle? There has been a lot of gap. Are you feeling emotional? Tell me, Uncle. What happened? Who is your uncle? Ever since you came out of coma, you keep calling me uncle! First of all, don’t scream. Second of all, you keep telling me you are my father. I have no clarity in this matter. Who would pay huge bills at the hospital and bring home an amnesiac? Who can say what your motives are, Uncle? Look! I have shown you all the photos of your childhood, Tillu. It could be anyone, Uncle. Second thing, you call me Tillu. what did you write in the hospital file? Bala Gangadhar Tilak! Hundred percent there is some confusion in this matter. Hm? Squeeze! Squeeze more! - Squeeze -Squeeze -Leave! -Squeeze -Go! Hey, Let’s go! Both can leave. Husband! What is he saying? Huh? Huh? Why is he clinging to a doll? -Hey, can’t you see? -Crazy girl! -Can’t you see? -You bumped into me and then blame me? I will teach you a lesson. Ah! Where is he? Oh no! You say you forgot your past and you sit here. She promised to return the money but broke my head and ran away. Like Bunty and Babli do you consider yourselves corn couple? Hey, hey! That’s not corn couple, bro. It’s CON. Con means to cheat. Corn is what you eat. There is a difference. Do you take me for a fool? I don’t know whether you are a fool or what? What do you want now? Who are you? I will remind you of your past. Including hospital expenses, it is 26 lakhs in all. I give you one week’s time. If you fail to pay, scoundrel…. Hey, hey! Who is this guy? Come… Bloody! Hey! -Come! Got him. -Hey, careful. -Hold it! Shh…come! Come! We are coming. You guys be ready Tillu! Tillu! Tillu! Doctor! -What happened? -Someone is taking our Tillu. Hey, take him inside. Shh. Doctor! Hey! What injection is that? Truth serum! Ten minutes. He will spill his guts. Hey, hey! What is this? What are you doing to my son? Huh? What is this, Tillu? What is happening here? There is a cheating case on your son. We are doing a Narco test. What is Narco test? They will put him on sedative and extract the truth. Sedative? Attention! What’s this? What are you doing? I am Iron Man. Hey, Doctor! So you iron clothes? The super hero. Crazy man! But he is dead. Oh, shit! -Where is the doctor? -Come here! Who else is a super hero? He Man. Very strong! Super Man. He flies in the air. Spider Man. Solid power. Hey! Do I look insane to you? All these people wear their underwear over their pants. Whatever it is, our underwear has to be inside our pants. If that is the case, you are Tillu Man. So, it’s T Man! What is your super power? I forgot my past. Tell me. Do you remember us? Why not? Who are we? For two weeks you have been following me in the hospital with your loser faces. You think I don’t know that. But I know everything. Because it’s a T Man. You don’t understand! Tell me. What do you want? We want a phone. Buy it. I want my own phone. When you buy one, it will become yours. Will it be mine? What do you want? Money. Bah! Even I am in great need of money. Uncle is also going crazy about it. How much do you want? Two crores man! Are you crazy? -Even on ATM you get only twenty thousand. -Hey! -Wait, Sir. -It’s a T Man! Please, Sir. It’s a T Man. One minute, please. What I am saying is it’s good that he lost his memory. Listen to the scientist. He doesn’t have a past worth remembering. What did you achieve? Are you Prabhas? Mahishmati is running because of you. Hey! I am an officer in Reliance, man! You only work for Reliance. Company doesn’t belong to you! How do you remember all this? Hey, Doctor! Don’t look lost. Put your talent to use. Patient remembers a few things but doesn’t remember a few others. How come? That’s our choice. We can choose. In the fifty percent that you remember, is there what we need? Definitely not. What do you say, uncle? -Bah! This is the problem. He calls her aunty. And he calls me uncle. Hey, Zimbabwe! Where did you get the sedative from? My heart rate is crossing 100, fool! Hey, T Man! Yeah, man? Your heart condition is chronic- Before I slipper you, go get some cold water. My saliva is drying up. You got me an RMP doctor. He is experimenting on me as if I am a rat. Hey, Kenya! Book a cab. I have to go to hospital. It’s time for TV serial ‘Chinnari Pellikuthuru’. Tillu! Don’t do that, man. Help me out. Will help. Tell me clearly. What happened? Radhika came to my room. I don’t know who Radhika is. But ok. -She asked me for financial help. -Ok. Then, what did you do? Since she asked me for help, I tried to get physical. What do you man physical? Huh? I tried to kiss her. That’s just romantic. How can it be physical? You are not being honest. I rather watch my tv serial. -Hey! She tied me to a bed, man! What for? Why? I asked her to tie me and hit me. What sort of sadism is that? I get a different kind of pleasure. Yuck! Hey, cat eyes! Aunty felt embarrassed and left because you sounded so dirty. What sort of behaviour is this? Have you any shame? Do you eat food or waste? -Money, man! -Uncle! Why don’t you go and console aunty? No. I won’t go. I will stay here. Of course, you will. This conversation sounds interesting to you with all the cots and ropes. It happened in this very room. You remember? Can you let go of the phone? Please? I remember the whole thing, man. Ah! Yes! Tell me! In’ Pokiri’ there is a guy who heads the team opposite Prakash Raj. He also gets tied to the bed and gets beaten. It is the same scheme, right? Hey! Why are you acting like a teddy bear? If you abuse Bunty, you will develop piles. Are you warning me? Hey, what are you doing? Why are you so angry and frustrated? What happened? Did someone tie you up to a bed? Yes! Yes? Bed is trending here. Ah? Have we tied? Have we hit? Have we eaten? Have we slept? Is it morning? What did you do? Nothing? Why didn’t I? Bloody! I should have shot you the day I chased you. Crazy. Did you listen to that? Some silly gentleman commented my past isn’t remarkable. My past has a chase, two crores, shooting, Hey! Get up! Bloody bison! -So many amazing events! There! Aunty is here. -Move! Get out! Yes! -Move! I will break your legs! -Yes! Beat him! Move! -Beat him! Hey! Have you gone crazy? Hey! What a pervert you are! -You want to be tied to the bed and beaten? -Yes. -Broom! I will hit you with a broom! -Aunty! Have you gone crazy? Who is your aunty? You look like an uncle yourself. How come you are here? Move! -Aunty? -How old are you? -Have we given you our daughter’s hand? -Aunty! Do you see, …the photos of nude women in the room? Why? Why did you do this and bring this anger down upon this mother? -That’s true! - Hit him first. What sort of photos are these? -Beat him up. Hey! Yes! “Hello, doctor! My heart has gone missing” When we drink just a beer, we lose control. No one can stop. They would say ‘done with you’. You put me on sedative and saw in return a big picture. You want to get the truth out of me? Rogues! Sir! Greetings. He is roaming all over the hospital, Sir. He says he knows Tillu's secret That's why I brought him here. What do you know? Give me five lakhs and I will tell you. I saw Tillu and Radhika bury a corpse and I blackmailed them for money. They promised to pay but deceived me and ran away. Bloody! Will you testify wherever we ask you to? You have paid me. If you want, I can even testify against you. Do you know where Radhika is now? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ah, ok! Hang on! Sir! They caught Radhika. They are taking her to the court. -Where did they find her? -Goa, sir! -What about my phone? It must be in Radhika Madam’s belongings Sir, If you please don’t mind, one small observation, Sir. There are as many loopholes in this case as there are holes in a Mysorepak. Take him into custody! -Sir, sir… listen to me! -Move! Hello sir! Where are you taking me? I have just been discharged, Sir. -They have even planned a ritual at home. -You are a jinx yourself. -Right, I am a jinx. Let me go, then! -I will kill you. This won’t work, Sir. Reduce the AC and lower the glasses so that my aura is distributed reducing the impact. Move aside! Move, move! Sir…What happened sir? Move aside! -Hey! -Do you see him there? Go, get him. Brother! It’s risky even if you touch him. His name is already in records, just need god’s consent Hey, keep quiet. Quiet! You joke a lot. No joke. I am serious. Chitragupta has already set the clock for you at 1.30. Now set your own alarm. Oho! Return my phone. I will handle your case. Huh? He is asking for his phone. Ok. -It means she won’t give. -Won’t she? Hmm. I will give you both now. The judge is here. Shh! Hey! One black coffee. Cut your hair first. Law shouldn’t have so much hair. What is it, Rao? Is it a murder case? Have you killed someone? Come on, Ma’am. I got a direct witness too, Ma’am. Move! Move! Greetings, Madam. Mr Chandrakant… It’s me! What happened to your head? I slipped and fell while helping a blind old lady cross the road, Madam. Oh! What do you do? I drink at nights in the outskirts of the city at Gandipet, Madam. Oho! What is your salary? Please don’t joke, Madam. Who started it? Tell me. One day I saw these two burying a dead body and blackmailed them for money, Madam. Tell me, Radhika. Madam! Rohit is my boyfriend, Madam. He came to know about my affair and tried to hit me. I pushed him in self-defence. His head hit against the door and died. Everyone with internet becomes a lawyer. They never said you hit him to death. You killed him. That’s it. Your Honour! Not so dramatic. Ok. Aunty! Aunty? Who is this Jonty Rhodes? So you two have an affair or what? Huh? I was hit on my head very hard. I went into coma. I remember nothing. Who hit you? -This uncle. You said you don’t remember? So, did you hit him? Ma’am! During interrogation we- How can you hit him into coma in the name of interrogation? Aunty! Aunty! There is something else. This uncle put me under sedative and conducted an illegal Narco test on me, if you don’t mind. What happened because of that? My brain’s serotonin and cortisol levels have totally lost balance. Hey, hey, hey! Tell me in simple words. As if I know what it means. My doctor told me and I am repeating it to you, Aunty. Why don’t you call me mother-in-law? Madam, he is crazy, Madam. He talks crazy. Hey! Say it. -Tell her what happened. -Ok,ok. Small correction, madam. You may be confused. Tillu and Radhika Madam didn’t do this. -Rao Sir and Radhika Madam did it. -Hey! Why are you lying? Hey! Why are you lying? Madam, he is lying, Madam. The five lakhs Rao Sir gave me. Keep it. The 25 lakhs you promised me- Not able to hold your horses? Chandrakant! In the court, you must say exactly how I tell you. Do you understand? You should change your testimony. I will. But where is the proof? Why do you bother about it, Chandrakant? Here’s the 25 lakhs I promised. I will give you more. You must say exactly what I tell you. Enough of watching. Give me my video back. He is lying, Madam. Rao sir! He is lying, Madam. Order! He is lying, Madam. What do you mean he is lying? He is your witness, isn’t he? I mean… Hey, professional drinker! Tell me what happened exactly. Otherwise I will send you to jail. Madam! Madam! It was Rao Sir and Radhika Madam who committed the murder. But Rao Sir is threatening me to take Tillu’s name instead of his. If I don’t, he is blackmailing me that he will book me in POTA case, Madam. This is the truth. But I don’t even know the girl, Madam. Hey, Fish! Speak up. Go and speak. You don’t know the girl and yet you were dancing in your underwear in her flat? What’s up? Mr Fish? Head Constable? You want to be stuck there life-long? It is you who handles all the illegal dealings of your Rao Sir. You know about it. Yet I know it. The entire department knows it. Will someone do something? No. You have to do all this. What can you do? Your Rao sir’s performance with Radhika has been recorded with good BGM. You must produce it at the right moment in the court. Hm? Let's all meet in the court of law. This is all your sketch, right? It’s 1:30 uncle. Didn’t you check? Three…two…one D J Tillu! Silence! Don’t you know all phones should be in silent mode in the court? What is this ruckus? Madam! Rao Sir’s phone is found in Radhika’s belongings, Madam. The content in the phone is leaked to the media. Hey! Selfie! (Indistinct talking) Come on! Come on enjoy! Rao! Naughty, naughty boy, huh? What’s this man? Ah… It’s an undercover operation, Madam. Undercover? In underwear? Girls, drugs and murder… You seem to be a mini Pablo Escobar, Rao! Huh? Anyway. To take Circle Inspector Rao and Radhika into remand, …and properly investigate the murder of photographer Rohit Kumar, …the court orders the police department. Listen, Jonty Rhodes! Until this investigation is over, you and Chandrakant should not leave the city. Understand? [indistinct talking] Let’s go! Hey! He is here. Hey, what’s up, prisoner? -You… -Sir, wait… Hey! Remove your hand! How dare you! Did you notice? I am going about under Z category police protection. How do you think it would be with me? I trusted you. That’s why you were cheated. How can they cheat unless you trust? Rao! I tell you this as an experienced criminal. There are many homo-sexual people in prison. Gays. You are good looking, Be cautious. Time, man! Hey, cutie! It’s your time, man! Ah? The time is 2:30. And it will be 3:30. After all he is going to jail. Take him away, Sir. Take him! Bye, prisoner! Bye. Bye! Bye! Walk! Enough of staring. Walk. He will get married in jail. He thinks we will be scared. Move! Just ignore him, let’s go! It’s so hot. Isn’t there AC? Jail! Are you seeing my costume menu? Everything is corporate. Hm! I played golf just now. The rich ones play golf. Do you know about golf? What’s more about it? A hole will be here and a ball will be there. People get tense about that for 25 minutes. Even after a lot of scientific analysis looking here, ...and there if they hit, it will not reach the goal. Oh my god! They will be emotional about it in English. The mindset of wealthy people will be this. You don’t know this. You’re a poor kid, right? That’s it. I forgot that you’re here. Little busy! Tell me. I’m sorry Tillu. For what? Hm? I’m really sorry Tillu. That’s what dear. We didn’t do one thing, right? I’m asking for what you’re apologizing for. That day… -Hotel.. -Hey! Even after knowing that they will kill me, you left me. That’s how worldliness is. When they hit me hard like hell, I went into coma. tsk! Leave that now, Radhika! No one needs the truth here. Everyone wants only false statements. You betrayed me, …and I betrayed you now. High betrayal! Cheating me and escaping with 2 crores of money, ...you will not spend your life with any orphan children or like saints , right? Life has to be enjoyed. To the happening places like Delhi, Bombay, Goa like these. We did one thing. We listed the pubs, bars and the places we like. That’s it. Operation catching the girl starts. We covered Bombay on Monday. Is this Riviera club, Mumbai? Did you see the girl singer in the video there? We covered Delhi on Tuesday. A female singer! I’ll give you commission. A saree function is about to happen at our house. Not a saree competition man. It’s a saree function. Send the video of that girl. We leave Wednesday as the time is not good. I worshipped God and requested him for your whereabouts. We got a lot of videos then as if it were an Indian idol competition. After getting tired of searching for the sweet voice I want, ...we opened the Goa list on Saturday to chill. There you’re. Club Nostalgia! I told you, right? They will give your number if I tell them about a function at my home. That’s how it would be with me. Thank you. Thank you! You did whatever you want and now you’re giving food to the needy like Mother Teresa! Huh? God bless you! You please eat. I sent the men who brought you from Goa, ...and also I filed the case in the court. Only we want is Rao’s mobile and we found that in your room after a strong search. We’ve filed the case against ourselves. That’s how it would be with me. Radhika! Please don’t cry. Your tears will fall in the curry. Salt will become more. Where did you get money to do all this? You used me. I used you. All arrangements are done? Did everyone come? -Yes sir! Greetings bro. Hm..tell me, dear. I need a sum of two crores sir. Two crores! Huh? Are you crazy? Once upon a time, a girl called Radhika came to you for singing opportunity. But you took it as an advantage and asked her to come to guest house. I’m thinking about telling it on stage now. Will they believe if you tell them? They might not sir. But a discussion in media will go on for 10 times and for the, ...11th time they will confirm it. I think you don’t know that media will decide everything in our country. That’s the top TRP scheme going on. Err… Do you’ve evidence? Evidence will come sir. Seeing me, the person who already went to guest house will come out. Pleading the judge. To justify her, all the news channels here will beat the music for your 101st film. Who’s that? Hey Mom, It’s dad’s 100th movie. (Indistinct talking) These are your bail papers. Enjoy! I’ll go now. Hm? I’ve a dinner date also. She’s a Spanish girl. I couldn’t pronounce her name. Yeah! Galina Polskova. It means, asking to be at the street. That’s why I’m going. There is no love at all. I can’t understand her Spanish language and she can’t understand my Telangana slang. It took a week for us to Introduce. [Spanish word] Thank you, ma’am. Ok then. See you! Please Tillu! What Radhika? Radhika! I didn’t give you bail because of any love or affection for you. I gave with a benefit of doubt that there would be some truth from your side. Come again, benefit of doubt! And you didn’t love me Radhika. I know it. Let’s suppose you loved me for your need. That’s it! So, from next time don’t think and tell. Feel it and tell. Don’t stop me. Hey Galina! What’s up! -Where have you been? -Hey! I’ve waited for five hours. I’m so angry and hungry. What happened? Ok! Don’t get stressed. It’s a very common emotion. I’m hungry. You want to eat me! Shut up! So, what do you want to eat? I want burgers, milkshake and potato. I want Cola No no! This is the city outskirts. All those are not available here. Umm… -Do you want masala dosa? -What is this dosa? -Masala dosa.. -What did you tell? I’ll tell you. It’s a rice batter. -They will put pan cake. -Okk, I don’t want masala dosa. No! One minute. Like pan cake. -Pan cake! Potato! -They will put potato on it and fold it. We just go crazy with coconut chutney on it. [Spanish language] What? [Spanish language] What are you telling? God! I can’t understand your words and you can’t understand my words. Get on the bike. [Spanish language] First get on. Come on, get on. Ok, thank you. Hey Shannon, do not recall. I will be off to Paris on your work. They took me without listening to me. Do one thing! You come to Paris along with them on new years night. Got the information about your money.
