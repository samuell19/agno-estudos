These two kids are fighting. Are they fighting for real? Kidnapping orphans. Profiting off illegal fights. Do you know how serious those accusations are? Try to remember everything you know, then confess. I don't know who the fuck filmed this, but it was forever ago. My name is Xiang Tenghui. I'm 43 years old. The year I got out of prison, I took up a contract for this sandpit in Longshan. I don't remember the exact date when I took this shortcut. A place packed with rocks. I knew at once there were bandits. Go check in the truck. I found it first. I did. -I did If you dare not hurt people, what are you doing here? Come to think of it now, I got hit on the head. You lost everything. I've told you a thousand times. That was a god-forsaken place. And you had to go. Now you have a concussion. The workers haven't been paid for six months, and they are always on my tail. Just the other day, they nearly crushed my skull. He's my manager at the sandpit. Wang Feng. The sandpit isn't making money anyway. I say we sell it to Li Sancai. How much do we owe the workers? Over sixty thousand. His head injury might not be visible but the sandpit was going bankrupt for sure. I'll go talk to Wang Jingfu. I thought you said you were done with fighting. Brother Hui. Mr. Wang. To what do I owe the honor? Check it out. Would you like to try this cigar? It's Cuban Cohiba. Why wouldn't I? Castro's favorite. Castro. Wang was a business men back home, got rich selling brasen powder. I'm just trying to find customers for the Longshan Brasenia. There weren't any before, but a little marketing can make a world of difference. I even came up with a slogan. Kids, drink your way to future success. China has just won its bid to host the Olympics. The sports industry is bound to thrive. You were a champion. With this club, you'll be training new ones. Wasn't my idea. You asked me to do it. I've showed you how serious I am. This was supposed to be huge yet here you are yanking my chain. This is a lot less than what we agreed. This is just for starting things up. You go and set up the club. In a couple of days, I'll get some government officials to show up at the sponsorship launch for brasen-powder, and it's done. I'll pay you the rest then. Find some fine kids. Strong ones. And this money is... innocent as a virgin. What kind of man do you take me for? Let's get to work. Let's get to work. Hurry up. Come on out. Out of the van, all of you. Stand up straight. I paid for their appearance. Kids are hard to find. Your son looks pretty stout. A little too stout. Binbin. Binbin. Binbin. Say hello. Say it. They are here. Help. Help. It's broken. What is it? It's really broken. You let a bunch of kids break your leg? Let go of my brother. Let go of him. You're shameless grownups who bully kids. My leg is broken. My leg is broken. My leg is broken. My leg is broken. Your leg is broken? You know what this is? It's called robbery, you know that? My leg is broken. I'll hand your sorry asses to the police. And you parents will kneel down to beg for mercy. We don't have parents. Cut the bullshit. Either come with me, or go talk to the cops. Bring them all in. Go. -Leave me alone. Starting tomorrow, you are officially the trainees at my MMA club. Remember who you are. The inauguration is next week. One of you needs to read this. Why the silence? Choking on the buns? You. Read this for me. I'm illiterate. My uncle didn't let me go to school. Hey. Find someone to memorise this. They are not ruining my big day tomorrow. Wang Feng said I was done with fighting. It's true. The kids were just advertisement for the brasen power. And Feng, that bastard still brought all my medals. At least something had to be real, he said. But the kids were like fish in the water. they thought they had found home. Distinguished guests, Honorable Mr. Wang, on behalf of the Longshan... the Longshan Tianfu Brasen Powder MMA Club and all its members, I do solemnly swear that we will, under the leadership of Coach Tenghui, train with all our might, overcoming challenges physical and mental... Dude, you've recited it a hundred times. Shut up, I haven't memorized it yet. We will, under the leadership of Coach Tenghui, train with all our might... This is so fun. It commands wind like the Dragon King. You've been playing with that crappy fan for days now. Turn it off. Brother Ma Hu, I think he's awesome. If he's willing to teach us, I can't imagine... You can't imagine what? We'll kick some serious ass robbing the drivers. The hell we would. If he were really a champion, how come I could knock him out with a brick? Plus, he doesn't even look like a good guy. He looks pretty good to me. This bed is so soft. I wish we could sleep here forever. Yeah, I've never smelt so good. What are you? A girl? What's your name? Su Mu. I'm Su Xiaobu and he's Ma Hu. I didn't ask. Did you have it memorized? Let's hear it. Distinguished guests, Honorable Mr. Wang, on behalf of the Longshanr MMA Club and all its members. Tianfu Brasen Powder. Test. Remember, while the recording is playing, do the lip-syncing thing without making a sound. Stand up straight. Look sharp. Music. Hey, Zhuzi, why didn't your boss answer his phone? What was that? What's going on? Tell me. You saw it, didn't you? Wang Jingfu, you son of a bitch It was them who reported me for selling counterfeit products. I'm a victim, too. Have a heart, will you? I found those kids for you. What would I do with them if you don't pay? You are asking me? How am I supposed to know? Those kids are from the mountain, right? Those little hillbillies... who cares what happens to them? It seems you're right where you belong. Xiang Tenghui. Like you've never been here. You were never serious about the club thing. So, stop pretending. You just wanted to con me for money. Go fuck yourself. Didn't Uncle Feng tell you? What are you still doing here? The dorm is locked. We can't get in. Was it my fault? I can recite it, too. Distinguished guests, Honorable Dragon... Dragon Club... MMA... MMA Club. It's over. All of that was just a show. And now there's no audience. So, no show. Let's go! You were going to train us to be fighters. I want to train with you. We all do. I want to train with you. Do you even know what MMA is? Get out of my sight. Those little hillbillies... who cares what happens to them? Feng was grumpy all day, mumbling non-stop about god know what. Later that day, Li Sancai came to me. He owned the sandpit next to mine. Get the damn kids out. Last night, those little bastards dared to rob my sand truck. Claiming that you're their coach. What, can't handle the competition so you stab me in the back? Let them out of the truck. I want to know who the fuck said I was their coach. You are our coach. No one is your coach. You are our coach. Well? Li Sancai. You're out of your mind. Brother Hui. Load up the trucks and let's go. Li Sancai, what the hell do you think you're doing? Brother Sancai. Brother Sancai. So, you're not paying? Brother Sancai. Stop. Li Sancai. You shameless son of a bitch. Two truckloads of sand, that's 400. Their parents have to pay me back anyway. Soon as I mentioned the word home, the kids started to play dumb. The engine won't start. How did that happen? What should I know? It just did. Son of a bitch, you broke my truck. The truck gave out. It won't start. How much further? I don't have a home to go back to. It's here. What about his home? Dad died, mom took off with some guy. My mom raised him and his sister. Why are you telling him that? What the fuck are you doing here again? Sis, what was he doing here? Delivering potatoes. Who is he? Did you get in trouble again? You kids go wait outside. Shut the door. Look around. Even if they did get into trouble, I won't be able to pay you. Su Mu and Ma Hu, you've been taking care of them? Besides them, I have a kid of my own. They haven't come home for years. I'm disabled from waist down but I can work with my hands. As long as you let them go, I'll find a way to pay you back. They didn't get into trouble. They've been working for me and I'm here to deliver their salary. Go smoke outside. Do you have to do it in here? Just needed some time to get used to it. I just don't understand you. It's not like they are homeless. Why do you keep those kids around? Now that you're staying with me. There are some ground rules. If you go back to doing what you did. You'll end up like lambs in a slaughter house. It's hopeless. Why can't you just hand them to the police? We've caused enough trouble for the authorities. Why bother them again? Put your finger on it. What's that? Insurance. It's for your own sake. I'll be goddamned. When I met you in prison, I didn't expect you to be a Good Samaritan. Is it really for our sake? Tell them, is it? I wasn't trying to be nice. Those kids screwed us up bad. Just tell me you know what you're doing. I'll just improvise. How hard can it be if Wang Jingfu could pull it off? Enough with the preparation, just go. Go now. Mr. Li. Brother Hui. I've been expecting you. With the Beijing Olympics coming, the government is determined to build up the sports industry. I say we roll with the trends. You're not gonna sell us out, are you? Picking the right lane and we're half way to success. Otherwise, it's all for nothing. From tomorrow on, you're officially trainees at the club. Brother Hui. You helped me a lot by getting me this place. I was going to you pay you back but with so little business going on here, I'm losing more money than I make. You thought I was here to ask you for sponsorship? I'm here to offer you an opportunity. You want them to fight for real? Are you stupid? It's just an act. Why do you train them hard then? Given who they are, they have no other choice in life, but this one. Faster, faster. Speed up, come on. He's a good man. I saw him giving sis money the other day. Let me use that. Only girls care about how they smell. Catch. Give me it. Come on now. That looked pretty harsh, right? It's all fake. And that's how you're gonna do it. Make it look real but it's not. You guys, come here. Come on. Put up the posture. Do the routine I taught you. Too fake. What the hell? Why did you hit me instead of him? See? Your pain reflex is important, but the thrill, that's what matters the most. Bro. What is it? It's been a long drive. Are they sending us back? Don't be stupid. If this was the ride home, it'd have been ten times bumpier. Brother Hui. You finally made it. Now that you're here, it's going to be so dope. Don't worry, coming right along. Let's go. Why so intense? It's not a real fight. Brother Hui. This time, you saved the day. Mr. Li. -Thank you. You're welcome. Brother Hui. What's the deal with the cage? Mr. Li found that out on some foreign website. Relax, it'll work. Brother Hui. Those two? Be patient. Round One. Start. What was that? That's obviously fake. So fake it bores me. That's too obvious. Brother Hui. Where's the dopeness you promised? Thrill, give me the goddamn thrill. Did you forget everything I taught you? You wanna go back to moving rocks? give me the goddamn thrill. Come on. Thrill You hit me for real? Brother Hui, Now that was dope. I told you to make it look real. Not real real. I told you to fake it. What the hell did you do? You should talk to him. He hit me first. I was yelling at you as loud as I could. You didn't listen. I guess I lost myself once it got real. Lack of experience. You'll catch on soon. Can't have you guys doing this every time. I'll go bankrupt paying hospital bills. How much are they giving you? What's our share? You guys robbed me and got me into this, eating and living under my roof, plus the training. How much are you paying me? I don't want any money. Why not? You see that? Why can't you be more understanding like him? If we keep fighting like this, will we win gold medals like you did? My sister has wanted to leave the village all her life. but she can't with her situation. So, if I can be a champion, I'll be able to travel far and tell her what's out there. Your sister... What happened to her? Troubled labor. Lost a lot of blood. That son of a bitch. No one can take advantage of her when I grow up. What's taking you so long? How come you finished so soon? I only have one foot. What are you laughing at? New shoes. New shoes. Faster, faster. Asshole. Why so serious? For victory, fire at me. Here's a secret weapon for you. For victory, fire at me. Hit him, hit him. Go back to sleep. The fights went viral. Welcome aboard. Never did I expect visits from business tycoons from the city. It was with our fists... that we fought a way out. We fought our own way out. That's awesome. Cheers. Cheers. I gave you a place to grow your business. Now, you're blowing me off? I'm not blowing you off. They bought my entire operation. There's nothing I can do. Plus, the business being bad had nothing to do with us not fighting. You should see what they have in the city. The decoration. The vibe. KING CLUB Compare it to yours. Twinkling Stars? That sounds like an ice-cream. Tomorrow is my club's anniversary. I can't have no show. Just do me one last favor. I'm begging you. Sorry. Come on, help yourself. There's plenty. OK. Brother Hui, something happened. There are some saboteurs. What? Saboteurs. Attention. Stand still. They... were faking it. Tell them. Were you faking it? Were you? You wouldn't talk? Let him speak. Don't move. Will you tell everyone that they were faking it? Say it. Say it. Were you faking it? Were you? Were you faking it? Were you? Get them. Keep running. Go on. Go on. You think you can get away? What are you doing? What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing? I could never forget the look in Ma Hu's eyes. He was definitely murderous. Brother Hui, take them with you. Run. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Hang by the river too often and you're bound to fall in eventually. Fake fighting got us in trouble. The bastard got it easy. He walked away with some scratches. As for the thugs, they weren't as lucky. You're the man. Got yourself in jail trying to be hero. I'm not an idiot like you. I have only one kid. You have a bunch of them. What would they do without you? I bailed you out. Processing paperwork now. Now that the operation was shut down, what are your plans for the future? If it was up to me, I say you start up a club for real, the kids aren't going anywhere, that's for sure. Who knows? Some of them might actually become champions. Didn't you tell me that Su Mu and Ma Hu are more talented than you were? I'm thinking, if they do become champions, part of the credit would be mine. We've talked about this. I was done fighting long time ago. Then what were you doing this year? It was an act. For money. An act? That's why you replaced the cotton with sand? And trained them as hard as you could? Also, when did you fish out those sports textbooks of yours? It was the real deal to you. Messing around like this... who are we kidding? I've missed my chance. Maybe in another life. But they do have a future. You don't want to see those kids sitting behind this window, do you? When you get out, we'll make things happen at the sandpit It's not like we can't afford to support some kids. Brother Hui. If you need money to hire a professional trainer in the city, you can sell the sandpit. Brother Hui, I'm not gonna lie to you. I had a deal with Li Sancai. Sell him your sandpit and he'll make me the manager. You son of a bitch. Since when did you get to make business decisions? Brother Hui. I've got it all figured out. I should stick to what I'm good at while I'm still young. And so should you. Right? Sis. I'm leaving. So... I came to see mom. Who are you looking for? Ten years ago, I won gold medal at the City Games. My mom was so proud, thinking that I was successful. This had to be a mistake. He would never break the rules. Please, I'm begging you. It wasn't easy for him to get where he is today. Please, recheck it. Just recheck it. We have looked into the situation regarding him. My urine sample tested positive. Got my gold medal revoked and I was removed from the team. We did the best we could to make it easy for him. What happened? You've suffered so much. Just say you didn't do it. Talk to them. You can't go back. What are you gaping at me for? Give the gold medal back. He tricked me into taking the pills. Later, he was fired. I was charged with assault and sentenced to years in prison. After I got out, my mom couldn't recognize me anymore. My son was recruited by the provincial team to be a champion, he ain't coming back. What are you doing? Inventory. Mulberry greenhouse, sold. Land, sold Sold. Sold. I'm not sure if it'd be enough for him. It's hard for kids from around here. My son made it. I just... don't want to be a burden to him. The winner is Ma Hu. Crawl if you have to. Xiaobu, don't run. Don't run. Xiaobu. Like wild grass we thrive. never yield or die. Like wild grass we thrive. never yield or die. Fighters of China. A formidable power. Fighters of China, a formidable power. The poem Dawn in Spring paints a picture of... You two, break it. Cut it out. The winner is Su Mu. The winner is Ma Hu. Do traffic rules mean nothing to you? You can't drive backwards. -I'll leave as soon as they got here. Leave now. Hurry up. -Sir. Sir, we're leaving now. Sorry for the trouble. Why didn't you wait in the parking lot? It's only a few bucks. Still sticking your head out the window like when you were a kid? He has to sit by the window on the plane, too. The sky is the same everywhere, I don't get what he's looking at. Will you snip that cigar already? I can't. It's the only good thing in my life. How did the tournament go? What do you expect from these off-line events. Boring. There's no real competition except for this moron. They aren't that bad. It's because you are good. I trained you boys too well. How is it you? How is it not? I'm the coach, you do as I say. Of course. -Sure. You must be Xiang Tenghui. I am. I heard that you take kids in, providing accommodation and clothes, and teach them for free? It is very kind of you to do that. Do you take girls? Come on, meet your coach. Coach. Xiaobu. Find a place for them. Come out here, he said yes. Hurry up. Coach. See? You can fight. They train hard every day. All kids coming here must be able to endure hardship. That she can do. By combining like terms we have the equation. X plus Y equals Z. You even teach them English? Xiaobu, set things up for them. Mr. Hui. This is the fighting performance contract from Xi'an. Good. He's exploiting us again. What was that? Nothing. What did you say? Go inside. Champion, champion... Hu. Champion, champion... Now we have a champion, too. Why the tears? It's only the qualifying round. Save it for when he wins the champion. This is the qualifying round. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Take a look at your Uncle Feng. Uncle Feng. -Did you miss us? How is it going? -You look good. Talk to your Uncle Feng. I'll go run some errands. What is it? Why aren't you eating? Can't wait to meet your date? I'll eat with you when you're the champion. Don't lie to me. It must be a date. Date, date... What is this? It's from me and Ma Hu. Uncle Feng. You still there? Where's your coach? He went on a date. We learned about your operation. And we... admire what you do. So many kids from the mountains and you gave them a shot at success. After deliberate consideration, we've decided to admit them into our school. No tuition or fees needed. I can't even begin to tell you how this makes me feel. Thank you so much. All these years, no school has ever agreed to take them in without extra charge. Principal Li. You're a good man. You gave them a second chance. Don't thank me just yet. You should know that we're a private school. I talked to the board members and they'd appreciate if you can pay for renovation of the school's playground. It'll cost about two million. That's not too much to ask. I seriously can't begin to tell you how this makes me feel now. Two million. Much cheaper than the tuition. Hiring teachers yourself means no student identity or diploma. I trust that you know how important those are. Uncle Feng, cheers. Here, here. Everyone, drink it up. Then go win a gold medal for our town. Uncle Feng. How about a performance? Please? Alright. Do it! Do it! Wait, wait... Why don't I read you a poem? Do you not see the Yellow River came from the sky, Rushing into the sea, ne’er to return? Do you not see the mirrors bright in chambers high Grieve o’er your snow-white hair though once it was silk-black? "TOTAL 1.6 MIL 380,000 TO GO" When hopes are won, oh! Drink your fill in high delight, And never leave your wine-cup empty in moonlight! Heaven has made us talents, we’re not made in vain Oops. Nice shoes. How's the date? Horrible. Not only is she ugly, she is also mean. You got a girlfriend? Them city girls don't date country boys like us. Why not? Well, certainly not the likes of you who keeps wrestling in the middle of the night. When I make it into the finals, my sister will see me on live TV. Then I'll attend bigger events and win you a golden belt. With this belly of mine, I'll break the belt immediately. You asked me a question when I was a kid. What do I think fighting means? I know the answer now. Fighting is our pass to success in life. Without you or the sport, we are nothing. Then, let me ask you this. If I had been a street food vendor, what would your pass to success be? Times have changed. You boys are lucky. Your trainer told me that you need to improve your ground skills. Here. Let's give it a go. Show me what you got. Come. -I don't think so. Come on. I'm too old. Ma Hu must have a girlfriend. I believe he does. Coach. Coach. Have you booked the flight for Su Mu and Mu Hu? But their names are not on the final list. What? The children look no older then ten. We are Tenghui MMA Club. That's right. Su Mu and Ma Hu. I see, thanks. They said that because of our club, Su Mu and Ma Hu's qualifications were temporarily suspended. I've got everything I need to know. Just give me some time to prepare. Sure, thanks. -I'll get back to you ASAP. Thank you, Director Xie. Let's go. Director Xie, what's going on? When we signed up for the tournament, there seemed to be no problem. Well... Sit, please. We... have no choice. Did you see the video I sent you? With the internet community nowadays, your taking in so many kids outside the school system. You will inevitably get public attention. But Ma Hu and Su Mu have a shot at the championship. You're an important man, please help us. I'll certainly make it worth your while. That's not it. Indeed, your kids are the favored contenders. People adapt to environment. They'll do well in another club. See? Like this one here. That way they get to stay in the competition, so that your hard work and theirs as well will not go to waste. I'll take care of the problem with the club. How about that? That's up to you. Sell my house in the county. I'll sell the car. I figure, that much money should be enough. Alright. Okay. Alright. Principal Li. Principal Li. Principal Li. Principal Li. Stop the car, please. Principal Li. Principal Li. Principal Li, wait. I will make the donation. Principal Li, wait. A few days after I rejected Director Xie, all of a sudden, the video went viral online. Mr. Xiang Tenghui. Will you answer some questions? Is it true that you organized illegal fights? What's your response to the accusation of recruiting child fighters? Is it true that you make money off minors? Will you answer the questions? How could you have done such a shameless thing? Using the children to make money. Aren't you afraid of karma? What if they were your own kids? Would you still have done it? As for the issue of Tenghui MMA Club recruiting and profiting off orphan fighters. The case has stirred quite a fuss among the public. Tenghui. He tried to trick me into sponsoring him. I knew pretty well what kind of man he was. So, I turned him down. He chose the wrong path. As the situation develops, we are receiving tip-offs from more individuals, which brought us one step closer to the truth. This is inhuman. Look how brutal that fight was. So, they came and fought here. I took a look and just couldn't bear to watch any longer. How well do you know Xiang Tenghui? Did you know what he was doing? Of course we did. That's why we rejected all his requests. We refused to let him run his operation here. So, you have no accountability whatsoever? I... Why did you reject him? I can't comment on that. Why is that? He called my products counterfeits. How is that possible? Everyone drank it. Tianfu Brasen-powder. Turn off your camera. You fucking assholes. Fuck off, all of you. Go get a real job. The house behind me was Tenghui's home. He once lived here. And his sister still does. There she is. Miss, Miss. What do you think of what your brother did? Allegedly, some parents have taken their kids away from the club I'm not leaving. I want to keep training. Miss. Did your brother abuse those children? Miss. I'm not leaving. Let go, I'm not leaving. Thanks to the efforts of the Longshan District government, some children have made contact with their parents, others, too, were taken good care of and went back home, where they'd receive compulsory education like other children their age. The authorities have put up a special task force for further investigation on the issue. Anyway, I still think that society should give everyone a second chance. Don't judge him too quick. We need more tolerance. Tolerance. Try it yourself. Go on. Thank you. In any case, your club must be suspended and rectified. As for the punishment, we'll carry out investigation on possible illegal activities. Sign here. Since our report, the story has drawn considerable public attention. Two veggie buns. And through accounts from different angles and of different individuals, we were able to provide our viewers with the full truth. Now, let's once again introduce you to the man of the hour with this video footage. You've seen how well equipped we are. If you want to be champion, we're your best shot. We have the capability and the resources to make that happen. Those kids have trained for years and endured plenty of hardship All they need is an opportunity. Rest assured. Opportunities are all that we offer. Those outsiders don't know what they're talking about. It's all bullshit. Don't listen to them. When they learn the truth, the other kids will come back. Those kids cried their eyes out when taken away. The parents didn't even ask for their opinion. I never allowed you to drink. Go on now. But we have training later. Just for tonight, everyone drink with me. All right. We'll drink. Xiaobu, fill everyone's glass. All right. We don't care what people say. We're not leaving. You gave us a second chance. You're like a dad to us. Here. Let's drink with our dad. Cheers. Drink up, and then we go separate ways. From now on, I'm not your coach anymore. What are you talking about? I've signed the papers transferring you to a new club. You can stay in the tournament and win the golden belt, moving on to international events. I'm not going. It's done. You have to. Who gave you the right to do that? Who do you think you are? Who do I think I am? And what am I to you? You're nothing. I trained you. I can sell you to whomever I want. What? I'm supposed to support you forever? Do I owe you? For years I've been training those kids, and they all left, just because of some newspaper. I'm fucking sick of this, so I quit. Dinner's over. It's the end of the road. Now get the fuck out of here. When did they build this road to the village? A long time ago, we could go anywhere we want now. Life is good nowadays. We'll find a place here to retire. Just look at that view. Everyone drinks mineral water... The air quality is amazing. Definitely, and money can't buy that. and eats free-ranch chicken. Harvesting vegetables in their own yards. Living in country villas. -From the threads a mother’s hands weaves; A gown for parting son is made. Don't mess them up. Those are gifts from good people. Unpack the pencil boxes first. Make the kids happy. You got it. Are you sure you don't wanna go in? The kids miss you so much. A reporter in the city contacted me the other day, asking for an interview with you. They want your side of the story about what really happened. Water under the bridge. The kids are alright. I have that silk factory going on for me and my sister. Drive safe. Sown stitch by stitch before he leaves, For fear his return be delayed Coming all this way to visit. You really shouldn't have. Nonsense. Those two never returned? Nope. They wrote instead. One came just last month. Hi, sis. This is the West Lake in Hangzhou. One of the most fabled places in China. But I think our home is more beautiful. Ma Hu and I are doing great. We have this huge event coming. So we can't go back. Take care of yourself. Su Mu. Sis. Things are great. I'm going to Hong Kong and Macao soon. Wait for me. Ma Hu. The kids are going to Hong Kong and Macao. Let me see those. They all have the same post stamp. Perhaps I was overthinking, but I went to check out the address anyway. Don't move. Do you know how to drive? What's the matter with you? Ma Hu. Stop. Come here. Stop. Stop running. What the hell is going on? What's that look on your face? Can't a guy pick up his old trade? What's taking you so long? I've just finished the postcard to our sister. You got anything to add? How come it's you? What are you doing here? Ma Hu asked me to. He came to me asking for help with regard to your leg. Did something happen to him? No. Don't you lie to me. He wouldn't go to you. What happened really? He got arrested for robbery. How can he be so stupid? Ever played duck and drakes? The rock you hold in your hand, no matter how hard you throw, it'd sink eventually. Such is my fate. After we joined the new club, I was constantly in a bad mood. My physical condition took a downturn as well. Then they kept me on drugs. I resisted and then they wasted me. I'm useless now. It's none of your business. I just worry for Su Mu. I'm the reason why Ma Hu did what he did. There's is no future for me. I found this at the sandpit when I was a kid. I was hoping to give it to you when I become a champion. Now that's not gonna happen. Give me their contract. Give me. Give me. You want the contract? Pay the breach fine first. Did you forget? It's all on the paper. You signed them yourself. Legally speaking, these kids are now my assets. You want to disregard the law? Good. So will I. Can you even afford to pay the fine? So, if I hadn't showed up, you wouldn't even go to the hospital? Brother Hui. Listen, we'll go to the hospital first then I'll find you a lawyer. What the hell? We have the rule of law in this country. Just take it to court. Those scumbags. Can't they see him for who he really is? Move. PD, do we have a go? Okay. Hello, Mr. Tenghui. It has been a year since the controversy over your club. You have never revealed yourself to the press before. Nor did you take any interviews. What made you change your mind now? I figured I should get some screen time while it's still a thing. Have you ever thought about what happened in your club? What do you mean? The orphans from Longshan Mountain trained to be professional fighters. You used them to make money. I didn't see it that way. No one cared about those kids. The actual training was a lot harder than that clip you played. I was pushing them to the edge. But nobody ever raised an eyebrow. I don't get it, why the sudden public attention? Because the press exposed it? So the good citizens in our society came to notice this special group and this very incident itself. A little too late. You mean, what happened happened because we didn't find out soon enough? And it wasn't your fault? I didn't say it's yours, either. Whose fault do you think it is? I don't know. How should I know if you don't? Please play the first video clip. All these years, he's been lying to us. We were too young to know anything back then. He tricked us into signing a slavery contract. Then, when we grew up, he took advantage of our trust and made us sign new contracts before finally, finally, he threw us out like we were garbage. Mr. Tenghui, if you don't mind me asking. What are your takes on these accusations made by Ma Hu, an orphan you raised for years? Mr. Tenghui. I thought we agreed that you weren't gonna mention that. But our audience is eager to know. Play the second one, please. Following this footage we shot, many have spoken out in your defense. You said to me yourself on backstage, that you saw them as your own children. Now that you're being accused by one of them, Aren't you just a little ashamed of what you did? Or, do you feel guilty? Wait, what's that supposed to mean? We only want the truth. What really happened. Did you or did you not lie to them? I did. I told them it was an insurance policy. And they were dumb enough to buy it. Now you're calling me a liar? Then a liar I am. Not only did I lie to Ma Hu and Su Mu but I have lied to everybody. Are you happy now? Liar. Boo. Quiet. You evil bastard. -Please be quiet. What did you say? Fuck you. Come over here, I'll kick your ass. What did you say? What was that? Quiet please. Quiet. Camera is still rolling. Don't stop then. Keep it rolling. I tricked them into leaving that shithole then trained them to be fighters. I tricked them into winning gold medals and gave them a means of livelihood, so? Who were they before me? About ten years ago, they had... No home. No land. No cattle. No job. No money. What were they supposed to do? Tell me, what were they supposed to do? Except for me, no one even bothered to trick them into anything. Did I get anyone killed? Did I let them starve or die out there? I gave them a future. Even if I sold them out. It's none of your business. Ma Hu... what he said was simply heartless, ungrateful. That's what it is. Idiot. The leg's fine now? Thanks to your outburst, the show went viral online. The owner of CJ was charged with using illicit drugs and assault. The club gave in to public outrage and forfeited our contract. We're free. What about him? He wants you to sit this one out. There's nothing he can do. Also, he wanted me to tell you that because he's famous now he can't come down here and kick your ass. So, he'll deal with your relapse when you get out. Make him proud. My sister wants to leave the village all her life. So, if I can be a champion, I'll be able to travel far and tell her what's out there. Everyone here and those who are watching behind TV right now. Good evening. This is the FGP China Night. Thank you for your continuous support. Now let's meet the fighters on both sides. First, a rising star from China, a young tiger striving against fate and made his way through. He will, on behalf of his hometown, challenge the defending champion from Brazil. This is his moment to shine. I believe that no one will doubt his ability. Ladies and gentlemen, please make some noise for a fighter from the great mountains. The Hawk of Longshan, Su Mu. And, defending his title, as the FGP middleweight champion, with a stunning record of 18 wins and 2 losses, including 9 K.Os and 9 submissions. The invincible king of MMA today The Titan Python, Connor. After a two-year rehabilitation training, Su Mu finally fought his way back to the ring. But, could he defeat this strong opponent tonight? Tonight's event is sponsored by Dongpeng Special Drink, Guangliang Wine, Chengdu Airlines, Ogawa, King of Fighters and Strength Sports. Gentlemen, this is a five round fight, in a light weight division. You've received your instructions beforehand in the locker-room. Protect yourself at all times. Listen to my commands at all times. Fight clean. Fight fair. Fight hard. Any question from the red corner? Any question from the blue corner? Touch gloves if you like to do so and back to your corners please. Everyone, thank you for tuning in to this welterweight final. You're watching a mixed martial arts fight under LMA rules. Time Keeper. Fighter, are you ready? Fighter, are you ready? Let's fight. We can see that Su Mu is playing it safe. He knows what a monster he's up against. Alright, Su Mu keeps dodging. Looking for a window to strike. There goes the kick. What a beautiful throw. Now Connor got Su Mu pinned down. The two break away. Facing an opponent as Connor, one little mistake is all that takes to end the game. Su Mu misses. Connor goes for the waist, pushing Su Mu to the edge. No wonder he's the best at this level. Strike back. Kill him. Su Mu took a few punches. Still looking for that window. That was a nice throw. Come on. We can see that Su Mu is seeking to grab Connor's left hand. so he can go into the armbar. Su Ku locks him up. Keep him locked. Lock him. Looks like Connor took back the upper hand. Hang in there, Su Mu. Good, good. Come on. You can do this, Su Mu. Round One pretty much went as everyone expected. Su Mu is eight pounds shy after all. It's hardly a close match. With Connor's life-long jujitsu training, Su Mu couldn't bring the fight to the ground and do what he's best at. Still, he patiently waits for a chance to strike, instead of passively defending. We should give the boy some credit. Good. It is certainly a stalemate. Let's see how Su Mu deals with that. After Round One, Connor is getting more aggressive. A even greater challenge for Su Mu. Fighter, are you ready? Let's Fight. Now's the time. Nice throw. Let's see if Su Mu can keep Connor down this time. He got out of it. The former jiu-jitsu fighter is good at floor techniques. They are in an entanglement. Get up, Get up. Get up, Su Mu. Get up, Su Mu. Cover your head and get up. Get up, Su Mu. Su Mu, get up. Get up, Su Mu. Get up, Su Mu. You asked me a question when I was a kid. What do I think fighting means? I know the answer now. Fighting is our pass to success in life. Without you or the sport, we are nothing. Miraculously, Su Mu got away. Connor was obviously shocked by that sudden strike. Could this be the window Su's waiting for? Good, good. Stop. Stop. Alright, K.O. Su Mu won. It was nothing short of a miracle. He won.
