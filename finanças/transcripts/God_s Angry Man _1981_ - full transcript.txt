GOD'S ANGRY MAN DR. GENE SCOTT TELEVANGELIST A FILM BY WERNER HERZOG I got every kind of audience out there and when I yell, why do I get my mic turned down? I'm gonna blow the speakers if I don't get it loud. Give me some volume. [narrator, in German] This is Dr. Gene Scott live from his TV studio in Glendale near Los Angeles. "When I yell," he says, "I want to be heard." When I yell, I wanna be heard. 'Cause I only yell when there's an occasion for yelling. God's honor is at stake every night. This is not a show. [narrator, in German] "God's honor is at stake every night This is not a show. It's a feast. A feast of a fading religious experience." It's not an accident we have an in culture, I got every kind of watcher out there. [gentle music] ♪ I'm weary and tired ♪ I just want to rest ♪ My labor is yours ♪ I want to rest ♪ My labor's yours ♪ Oh, Lord, I'm going ♪ Someday to that peaceful shore ♪ [narrator] His show, one of ma ny religious broadcasts on American TV, is a veritable one-man show, apart from the occasional musical interlude. The singer is Jake Hess. The younger lad is his son. [music continues] ♪ I know that soon I'll be going ♪ ♪ Going up north Dr. Scott is a controversial figure, constantly at odds with believers, officials and courts. He's usually embroiled in up to 70 lawsuits at once. Charges against him range from embezzlement of funds, to defamation, extortion and tax evasion. Scott runs three television stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hartford, Connecticut. He's live on screen between eight and 10 hours every day. The telephone numbers of his stations are often displayed on screen for his audiences. Four and a half years in front of these cameras, have taught me a lot of lessons, but one of them is that every time we have a great, exciting victory... [narrator] "Four and a half years in front of these cameras have taught me a lot. Every time we have a great, exciting victory at our religious festival, it's tougher at the next festival. That must not happen tonight. I turn to you, and some of you have not missed a single show in four and a half years." Most of the media in United States that people are used to is... I kid 'em and said they worship the great God "Two sides"... "Sometimes I kid that most of the media in the USA say that people worship the great God "Two sides". If they're down on the beach reporting that the sun's rising, they'll always add a little line saying that it didn't. I don't have a bland audience They're either for me or against me. At first they thought I was a madman. But I always take a firm stance no matter what subject is under discussion." ...you cannot avoid coming to a conclusion. So I think I polarize people. I take a stand... "So I polarize people because I take a stand. Some people say they've been waiting to hear exactly what I have to say. Other people want to go through the TV screen and pound me on the nose." ...or wanting to go through the television screen and found me on the nose. And there are some people that, I think, if Scott's for it, they're against it. That's a negative power. If I wanted to misuse it just... if I take a stand, I can guarantee... "If I take a stand, I can guarantee how most people will react to me." -Have you ever been threatened? -"Often." Could you tell us about one of the incidents? They decided in New England they would seize our property and tax us on the ground that we were not... [narrator] "The authorities in New England decided to seize our property and subject it to tax, stating that we were a TV station and not a church I barricaded myself in for 48 hours. It was raining and snowing. The street outside was blocked. Young people lay across the path and the sheriff arrived to seize our property. I had a table set up for Holy Communion and said, 'They'll have to climb over that to get in.' The sheriff couldn't get through. And to save face he took the coward's way out. They drove to a town 10 miles away and occupied our broadcasting offices. They were empty apart from a poor diabetic man. I've had doors kicked in, I've been threatened. I've had to travel with bodyguards." I had to be driving around with a body guard. "Things got really ugly during those tax battles. People didn't properly understand the essence of my message. They thought I was against the unions or the homosexuals I became a target. My shows are broadcast late at night, and some late-night viewers are pretty whacked out. ...make me a target, I--I'm never alone. That's why I'm never alone." We're here today to give our friends an idea of what our son was like when he was... [narrator] "We're here today to give our friends an idea of what our son was like growing up. Firstly I'd like to say that he's been a wonderful son to his father and I. We couldn't have wished for a better son." One of the fellas on the staff he re said to me... "One of the fellas on the staff here said to me, 'We want you to tell us something really nasty he did.' He was about two years old. He was about two years old. I was making icing for a chocolate cake. He was always excited when I made chocolate cake. He reached up to the cake, on his tiptoes, and stuck his finger in the cake." ...around and get the chocolate cake. So I slapped his hand... "So I slapped his hand, he fell to the floor and started to scream. He wanted to hold his breath until his face got blue. ...cold water faucet open... He turned completely blue. I whirled the cold water faucet open. It wasn't long before he started breathing again." While he was getting his PhD, doctor's degree in Stanford University... [narrator] "While he was getting his PhD at Stanford University, he'd come home at weekends to help me with the church work. He was struggling wi th something. He'd somehow lost his faith. And then he was reborn, as I'm sure you've heard when he talks about his faith and the resurrection. I think he's proud of his dad as his dad is proud of his son." I think he's proud of his dad as his dad is proud of his son. May I say one more thing? [narrator] "May I say one more thing?" ...is... the kind of a person that... "Our son is the kind of perso ordinary people can understand. Sometimes people study and then talk right over folk's heads. Our son has his feet on the ground. I remember a time when he was in seventh grade and his teacher sent me a little note with his report card. His report card was all As. And the note said, 'Do you know that you have a genius for a son?' ...with the report card and his report cards was all A's, and she sent me a little note saying, while he was yet in the seventh grade, "Do know--do you know you have a genius for a son?" That's what the teacher wrote me when he was in the seventh grade. So we're very proud of our son. "So we're very proud of our son." So I ask you to give me the dignity the way the Macedonia Ph ilippian Christians did Paul. [narrator] Scott broaches his regular evening theme: money. He asks to be supported as the Philippians supported Paul the Apostle. As long I could walk face-to-face with the Lord... "As long as I can walk face-to-face with the Lord I don't mind putting my faith in you. But I'd keep the government out of this church. But I'd keep the government out of this church." I'm asking again for that vote of confidence tonight. "I'm asking again for that vote of confidence tonight. I think I'm the only pastor in the world who gets his vote in the form of weekly checks. We're under fire. The papers are spreading lies ...you we'll be here till Jesus comes. I've told you we'll be here until Jesus comes, and we will." I'm asking you to hang your body in faith tonight, and you are. 15 minutes went by... "15 minutes went by. I have a message here like many others. 'Darling, because Dr. Scott asked us to, I've been trying to get my call through for five minutes.' We don't have enough telephones tonight. So I'm going to extend it into the next hour." So I'm gonna extend it. We're into the next hour. I'm gonna give you another 10, 15 minutes. "I'll give you another 15 minutes to decide what you'll do for the next year. And there's more coming in. Here's 360. Pledges for a year." There's 2,400... "2,400. 1,200. 240. 140, 180, 2400-- 2,400, and so on. Even up to 12,000 dollars in one go." 480 dollars, 3,600 do-- 600 dollars, 240, 2,820, 600, 600, 3,600, 360, 250, 253,000 dollars, on it goes. 2000, 1,200, 2,100, 12,000, 6,000, 1,200. I haven't got time to read them I want you to keep calling. "I want you to keep calling. The lines may be busy but don't stop calling. Now we're going to hear 'T he Four Statesmen.'"

[narrator] "We're approaching a quarter of a million dollar in 36 minutes. We'll go another 45 minutes and see if we can't get over a quarter of a million." This Saturday night, as we're here live and we reopened the Gideon... "This could be a million dollar night." ...could be a million dollar night, but at least I wanna to see it go over the quarter of a million. Here's 3,600, "3,600 dollars. 1,200." Wait a minute, Joe, bring those back. "Wait a minute, Joe. Bring those back." We've already crossed a quarter of a million. "We've already crossed the quarter of a million. And now we want to try for 300,000. ...less than, or in exactly 45 minutes. In exactly 45 minutes. All it takes is another 50,000. All it takes is another 50,000 dollars." Well, you've--you've seen me on television, that occupies... [narrator] "You've seen me on television That occupies about 30 hours a week live. And like any other pastor I preach to my parish on Sundays. I'm the elected president of a 2,000-strong parish and hold quarterly board meetings. I attend meetings, I'm responsible for the vice presidents. I'm a delegate and pastor at another church. It's located in northern California with 9,400 me mbers." We have 9,400 supporting members in our church. I have to deal with the mail load... "I have to deal with the mail load. I give spiritual guidance. I visit sick people." I am an elected pastor. My big concern is to make sure that when those members are in the hospital sick or have vital needs, they don't feel they're neglected by their pastor... "The people shouldn't feel neglected by their pasto but my father's still active and can help me out." ...feel that if he's at the hospital, I'm represented 'cause I get a quick report. And if they really need the pastor's attention, I try to get there. I run a mausoleum, which is a... "I run a mausoleum in Berkeley. The mausoleum provides this limousine and also my salary. I run a publishing house... The churches run a publishing house which owns a lot of subsidiary businesses. A real estate firm, a travel agency, and other operations." ...by one of the two churches, I don't own anything. The publishing house owns a lot of subsidiary businesses a real estate firm, which is responsible for handling the properties owned with a church. A travel agency that's relatively inactive now but... "The travel agency is relatively inactive now. We used to run teaching tours of Bible lands every year." ♪ If you want joy ♪ Come to Jesus [narrator] "If you want joy, come to Jesus. ♪ If you want peace If you want peace, co me to him.

[narrator] "For the last four and a half years I've stood between three and 10 hours live in front of the camera. During the last year, I've been able to take Wednesday or Thursday off. But that's very recent." But that's very recent. I've, uh... And, for example, the last week I was not able to do that. So I'm anywhere from three hours... "So I work nonstop, anywhere from three to 10 hours, except for Sundays." "On Sundays I hold two live services, each lasting two and a half hours. Plus sometimes a three to five-hour television festival." I'm in the celluloid world, Los Angeles. "I'm in the celluloid world of Los Angeles. I probably have the widest audience of actors and people from the film industry. They can't believe wh at they see. For them, standing in front of the camera means you're acting." I think one of the magazines locally... "One of the magazines locally summarized it like this: Raw anger. 'Scott's raw anger every nigh has something refreshing about it.' They say, 'Here's another poor son-of-a-bitch with the same problems as us, struggling for survival,' and they identify with that. Everything else they see on T creates an artificial environment at home. They see how I fight tooth an nail to save my organization. And how I struggle against the same obstacles they face. Pressure from the government, lack of understanding and ridicule. You go through life and try to fend off the flak. I do it in front of the camera every night." Uh... [narrator] "I'd like to be..." Let me tell you what makes me happy, get me on a jet... "Let me tell you what makes me happy. Get me on a jet heading for a town 8,000 mile away where nobody knows me. I'd like to go somewhere without having this constant life and death struggle." ...life and death struggle. I am... I am too good to be really bad and too bad to be really good. "I'm too good to be really bad and too bad to be really good. Actually I'd like to do some hellish things." ...hellish things. I can't walk by a guy kicking a dog... "I can't walk by a guy kicking a dog without going up to him and kicking him in the ass. This gets me into constant trouble with the authorities, like I am now. I can't let the church down." I look for challenges. I don't look for challenges... "I don't like this struggle. Many people think I look for challenges. But the challenges come looking for me. And I spend my life like a surgeon who is always called out for the most hopeless cases. My dream would be to lie on a beach, read books, and do exactly what I like. I'm always running away from the experience of being a pastor's son. From what people expected of me. I dream of a time when this church is no longer burdened by debt Where I'm voted out in a vote of confidence. So I can go to Australia with a clear conscience, become a professor at Plato University and go outback and hunt rocks." "That's probably exaggerated, But it's what I'd actually like to do. To get away from this mess." Would you like your own house "Yes, very much." Would you like to have children? "Yes, I'd like that very much That'd be the greatest joy in my life. I never talk about it in public. I'm so disgusted by religious organizations who show orphans to collect money. Before I came here I supported three orphanages as part of my church duties. I can't have kids of my own. I'm sterile." I had the mumps when I was 19. "I had mumps when I was 19. I've adjusted to it all my life. I made up for it with the orphan kids. In an orphanage in Brazil I once picked up a sandwich a kid had dropped on the floor. And he looked at me and said in Portuguese, 'He's my Daddy.'" ...pick up his bread and he looked at me and said in Portuguese, you know, "He's my daddy." I really love... "I love kids. Kids and dogs seem to like me And as long as that's the case, I feel safe." [whispering indistinctly] [gentle music] [men singing indistinctly in background] [music continues] [narrator] Dr. Scott has appealed for donations again but his audience is less forthcoming this time And I will not be defeated tonight. "I will not be defeated tonight," he says. "Five telephones are available. And one person has the key. And one person has the key." Not one more word tonight... "Not one more word tonight ...till that 1,000 comes in. until that thousand comes in. Do you understand that God's work hangs on 600 miserable dollars. [narrator] "Do you understand that God's work hangs on 600 miserable dollars? And you sit there glued to your chairs." ...must I teach you the principals of spiritual warfare? "How long must I teach you the principles of spiritual warfare? 30,000 means nothing now." ...held to an open shame while 22,400 pours in. "22,400 dollars pours in. But 600 dollars kills us. It has nothing to do with money! It has nothing to do with money." [exhales sharply] One person, hanging onto a miserable 600 dollars. [narrator] "One person hanging onto a miserable 600 dollars. 30,000, But people who name the cause of Christ... "But people who name the cause of Christ and sing 'I surrender all,' will let God hang over peanuts." What is this but a festival of faith? "What is this but a festival of faith? ...but hanging on the impossible? What is faith but hanging on to the impossible? The network ought to be shut down. [narrator] "The network ought to be shut down." If God can't find for people, what is Christianity? "What is Christianity?" Games, gimmicks, word, massage or life and death? "Games, gimmicks, words, massage, or life and death?" You would have to tie me down with ropes. "Last night I said you'd have to tie me down with rope to calm me down." Carnal Christians. "Carnal Christians, when it gets close to victory you duck out!" God brings it so close that those that couldn't give a thousand could be the ones that bring it over, but you sit there glued to your chair. Husbands and wives, if I we're married to either one of them... "Husbands and wives out there sitting glued to your chairs, I should kick you both in the butt. If one of you has fallen asleep in front of the TV, someone should jump on your stomach. This is war!" We ought never to bog down. "We ought never to bog down. Come on, Joe. I won't hit you." [Dr. Scott] ...to bog down. What 400 to go. "What? Only 400 to go? Why didn't you do it earlier? ...Gene Scott looks like. I don't care what Gene Scott looks like. God's honor is at stake. ...that grab a hymn book... There are people that grab a hymn book and promise to go on a great crusade, saying, 'I'll go wherever you want, as long as it doesn't cost me a few measly dollars.' 100, well over. Now we're well over. But after I yelled at you!" ...'cause you love God? [growls] You say I'll take it back, God will spite you if you do. you know you should have given it. [interviewer] Um, Dr. Scott.. [narrator] Dr. Scott, do you have any private wealth ? "No, nothing. If you can find any property I own in the world then you can keep it. I don't have any real estate, property, stocks or cash. No bank account, no house. I own nothing. Everything's owned by the church. It pays all my expenses. The church can vote me out. It's not some ps eudo-operation. I'm enough of a realist to know they could do that. To appease your curiosity, my possessions consist of this black bag. No one apart from me is allowed to look inside." There's one, two, three, four zippers on it. "There's four zippers on it. When my friends and relatives send me a birthday card someone else looks at it first. I'm never alone. I don't have any privacy. This bag...is mine. This bag is mine." Can we have a look at what's inside? "No. I hope somebody thinks there's 10 million dollars in gold bars in it. It gives me dignity to have at least something I don't have to expose to everybody." Uh, maybe there's dirty socks. "Maybe there's dirty socks. I hope when I die, government bureaucrats get to me and salivate themselves sick getting into this bag. It's a kind of joke. It may be my memoirs." I have no privacy except this black bag. It may be my memoirs, but, uh, my simple dignity of privacy... "This bag is all I possess." I don't own anything. I have no ins-- I have life insurance worth millions. "I have a life insurance worth millions payable to the church. In fact, I'm worth more dead than alive to them right now. In fact, I'm worth more dead than alive to them right now. Um, I came with a unanimous vote... "I came with a unanimous vote to get this church out of debt, but I'm also the guy who goes to jail for it. Last February when I refused to give the authorities a list of our private donors, I was handed a jail sentence. Like a journalist who refuses to name his sources. I'm 50 years old and I'm in good health, but at night I want to quit sometimes." I want to quit sometimes. If you ask me if I'm 100 percent... "If you ask me if I'm 100 percent sure of my faith: no, I'm not. As a philosopher I can't even prove I exist." Do you ever cry? Are you a man who cries? Yeah, I almost cried a minute ago. "Yes, I almost cried a minute ago when you asked me what I dream of." Gee, I-I... Misunderstanding. "This misunderstanding makes me very sad. Everybody thinks I'm a fighter, but I hate fighting. But push me and, uh, tread on a principle... "But if you push me and tread on my principles, I get pretty wild. I don't think anyone should be a boss. People who want to tyrannize are abusing their authority. I don't want to be anyone's boss. I have my own boss in heaven. Yes, I cry a lot of times. About once a week, I cry it all out. Mostly when I'm on my own. I don't think I'm a cry-baby. But it just bursts forth." I don't think I'm a cry-baby, but yeah, it bursts forth and I suppose the thing I cry the most about is misunderstanding. "And I suppose the thing I cry the most about is misunderstanding." I believe I'm the most honest guy on TV. "I believe I'm the most honest guy on TV I don't use Jesus to peddle lies. I don't use lies to win people over. I encourage Christians to be Christians, yet I'm the guy being attacked." [interviewer] You seem to be very lonesome. -You seem to be very lonesome -"Yes, sure. I mean, who can I have as a friend?" Every friend is a potential enemy until... "Every friend is a potential enemy until this work is finished. I guess I'm lonesome sometimes. I'm a loner. I guess I'm lonesome sometime but I think I'm more of a loner than I am lonesome. I have my staff all around me who I like being around, but I don't have any really close friends. Yeah, I'm lonesome. Yes, I'm lonesome." I already got it done. The part that counts. [narrator] Nearly every evening on his program , Dr. Scott ridicules his adversaries, judges or government authorities. Here he's mocking the FCC who want to revoke his broadcasting license. He brands them as apes and demonstrates how to hit a bureaucrat on the head. [Dr. Scott] He can't even hit his cymbals anymore. [whirring] He is wacky. - Hit a bureaucrat on the head. - [screeching] This is all he knows to do. Get the profile, he's good-looking, watch his eyes protrude. [screeching] "Watch his eyes protrude. Look at that." "Then he starts to squawk." [Dr. Scott] We got him on a run folks, he can't even-- We got him on a run folks, he can't even hit the other cymbal. - [clattering] - [laughter] - [applause] - [screeching] [Dr. Scott] I think we ought to give the FCC, and you notice, no matter how they land, the right end is always pointed at the camera. - [laughter] - [cymbals clanging] [narrator] "The right end is always pointing at the camera." I think we ought to give the FCC there dignified monkey salute tonight. Dr. Scott is giving the FCC a monkey salute. He's mocking them now. ...if it's 14 hours, we can still do it and we'll win. "We'll win. Now give the FCC their monkey salute. You should see this at home." [Dr. Scott] Give me some monkey farm, the FCC Monkey Band monkey farm music. I'll fly away. [cymbals clanging] Let 'em go. - Look at 'em. - [bright music] Here's your bureaucrats. Would do you like to grow up and be a bureaucrat if you're a kid watching? FCC monkey band. Get it back there on old Blabby back there. He's already talking to the press. [music continues] "A bureaucrat is already talking to the press. That's our government for you." [Dr. Scott speaking indistinctly] Watch this guy turn here. Mark of the beast six times. One, watch him, one, two, three, four, five, six, over he goes. One, two, three, four, five, six. Over he goes. Get the old clocky one back there, get him going. Hit him on the head, Joe, get him out in front with his red cotton pants and bang him on the floor like you did. Yeah, that's right. Hit that one again. Hit him on the head let him-- turn him, bang his head on the floor. That's right. That's the only way to treat a bureaucrat. [music continues] Hit him again.
