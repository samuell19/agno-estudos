Will I be willing to do it? How many people around him aren't necessarily in the position that he may be now in where there's, you know, there's-there's a few pennies in the bank... I don't really know why it's tolerated. This is a high-risk game for us. I don't think he's that-- he's that prolific at all. It's humorous meets irony. [hideous chuckle] He's very considerate. [hideous chuckles continue] He's very considerate, which is something to be celebrated. All contemporary art is a paradox. I know Banksy. There's always another twist to the Banksy story, isn't there? And-and he, whoever he is, has always got other tricks up his sleeve. He's clearly very clever because, um, I-I think peop-- the fact that he infiltrated Bristol Museum. It was a surprise to everybody. He must be a good man. He must be a good bloke. Coming back to Banksy again, he's got empathy in his-- in his paintings if you look right. I never get requests to-- come and talk to me about Paella and Stevie Wonder, because even though they don't give interviews that often, they do give interviews. The one person that I do get asked about continually is Banksy. And I normally get, um, I would say, two phone calls a week. Is the fact this man has made a lot of money out of doing something that's basically illegal, criminal damage to property, is that gonna encourage more people to do it, or discourage them? Plainly, it's gonna encourage them, 'cause now they see that it can be a valid route to making-- well, in Banksy's case one assumes, quite a lot of money. - Hm. - And that's got to be attractive. - Banksy-- top man-- puts stencil graffiti on the map. More power. But maybe my Banksy is Banksy. Banksy's cool, man. - Yeah? Yeah, I know. He's... - Where...? I want more of Banksy's. Where's all the little Banksy's? Let's go. Let's go straight to the bank. Let's surround the bank. Let's fuck the mortgage bankers while we're at it. You just said it. I mean, it's graffiti's. They belong to the garage. We've tried to do our best, I mean, to keep them, but, I mean, they will live like graffiti lives... in a city. But when you think of a Damian or a Banksy, then you actually think-- if I say "Banksy," you say, Uh, mysterious and he's, he's got sarcasm there... I think Banksy's shit. [laughs] Why don't you like him? 'Cause he's fuckin' overpaid art fag. He cuts stencils out. Banksy personally imported all that fuckin' dope into Bristol. Did he? - He did. I know that for a fuckin' fact. The whole question about "Who is Banksy?" is "Who is Banksy?" You know, and-and, um, and, um, I mean, famously Banksy's people always say there's a bit of Banksy in all of us. You know, if you ask anyone at one of their exhibitions who he is and they say, "Well, maybe it's me, maybe it's you." And I quite like that idea. I've never been that sure how I got to meet Banksy. How did I find him? I think one of the things is you go and interview this person and I wasn't like in awe because I didn't know much about him, but obviously he's standing there and you're waiting for someone and you're thinking, "Who the fuck am I waiting for?" 'Cause you don't know what he looks like, you don't know what he sounds like, and, eventually, you kind of-- this guy-- uh, his manager Steve, turns up and he says, um, I got a phone call, he says "he'll be with you in a second." I turn around and I can tell that the phone call is very close to me. I can hear it, like in stereo, through my phone and through, you know, kind of proximity. And then I turn around and there is Banksy. So, I think. And he seems, you know, he was quite scruffy, uh, not fantastically scruffy, quite scruffy, had, uh-- um... he had a silver earring, I think, a silver tooth, slightly unshaven, you know, kind of bit of morning shadow, a bit more than I've got, and he drank lots of Guinness, and I drank lots of Guinness. And, um, I suppose after about half and hour, the thought playing in my head was, Well, this is all very well, but how do I know that you're Banksy, one, and two, do I really care whether you're Banksy and if I'm being fobbed off? Um, and I suppose what convinced me that he was was that he just talked about himself with kind of such knowledge and such ease and, you know, it-it just didn't seem possible that he couldn't be. It'd seem pointless if he was trying to be-- he was-- well, he was very convincing anyway. But, you know, having said that you read things afterwards where apparently, he's this kind of posh-public schoolboy, um, and, uh... maybe it was him, but he was selling me kind of his public persona of himself which was that he'd been to a camp and he'd got into trouble and that he'd ended up in some kind of, I think he said he ended up in some remote town. He wouldn't go into detail about it, which it made me slightly suspicious. Um, but then again, maybe both versions are true. Maybe he went to public school. Maybe he did get into trouble. He wouldn't be the first person to. You know, Banksy had some little things up on the wall, he was there, um, and we just kind of met and said hello and he was lovely, um, sweet, polite, kind of shy, um, and I didn't-- I loved his work. I mean, I think the image that I fixed on and, you know, this'll give you a sense of, you know, that... "Money won't change you, but time will take you out" as, uh, James Brown would say, um... he had little stenciled images, you know, on Aaron Brother's frames or something, you know, like, um, of his, uh, Molotov cocktail thrower with the, uh, the flowers in the bottle. - Hm. - Um, and I loved that. I think they were 300 bucks or something. To be honest, I looked at that picture there and I think, "Was that Banksy?" I'm not sure. I think it probably is. I was in a pub with him. I got pissed with him. We did a good interview, I wasn't sure if it was him, and in the end I decided it probably was him. I feel I know him. I feel I recognize the signature as if he leaves an aura behind of having been there. And the place, in fact, becomes quite holy, you know, because you don't just-- it's not just the piece of work. You can imagine him having... because-because the piece of work is always located. The-the-- is-- 50 percent or 80 percent is location. So, it's all around a "Keep Out" sign or a "No Filming" sign or a "Don't Dump Rubbish" sign. You know that he's walked past that sign every day and he's noticed it and started to think about it, and then his brain is what-- until you get the sense of standing at a place that he stands and viewing something through his eyes, um, a piece of street furniture or, um... and knowing that that environment is important to him is, is, I think, just as interesting as the work. [siren blaring] What's that piece of art over there? No idea, mate. [mixed chatter] Could you have clearly revealed his identity, I suppose you could've done, but because we were in such a different time that-- or you were in... I think, if-if you had it, it'd be a betrayal of trust. I do think one of the things about journalism is that if someone offers you something on some terms, you've got to respect that. Um, you know, and if you're going to challenge it, you've got to do it in an open way. I mean, what would that do, kind of get my mobile out, go like that, and then run away? I just think there's something dishonest about that. He doesn't-- he sort of breaks rules a bit, but he doesn't break-- he doesn't go over the line of sort of doing it... I love graffiti. It's like not... It's a tagless art. - Yeah. It's more, um-- Yeah, tagging is stupid, but if it's proper art, then it's... - And it actually means something instead of... Like, people just write rude words on doors and stuff and they think it's cool, but he actually just does it for a meaning. I like that. - And a lot of people will offer him things. - Yeah. - I mean, I-- you know, I'm sure he has offers all the time of things that, either from institutions or individuals or offering him opportunities, but, in some ways, you know, how often he would want to do that. I-I don't know. But I can't imagine-- I should imagine he's very choosy about what he does. I mean, rightly so, because, you know, managing his exposure and his associations are clearly a big part of the whole image and personality. - There's something quite juvenile about Banksy's politics. I mean, we know that a nation under CCTV that really gets right to the core of what it feels like to be British, um, but unfortunately, in some respects, if we look deeper, we know that CCTV is probably an unavoidable, um, aspect, and there are times in our lives when we've relied on it ourselves. You know, and I had an apartment once, it was always, always getting people forcing on their front door and having some sort of CCTV camera even though it doesn't do anything, it helps deter-- you know, it's useful. It's not just a clean question of yes and no. Banksy tends to present things as a "No!" You know, it's very clea-- it's very-- quite amateur, um, "studenty" kind of politics, but we can engage in it. We know exactly what he means and exactly what he's feeling, and, um, and instantly kind of warm to it and get the joke. Um, and that's what I like about it. I walk around and you just smile, and you just look at it and you go, "Oh, fucking brilliant, genius." You know, it's so simple. And it's instantly recognizable as Banksy. And for all these people who are in the genre of Banksy, you, um, and you do, I walk around the east end on the Banksy tours. I go and inspect his work all the time and I'm very sad to see another one disappear or some wanker graffiti artist making their crappy nothing name by destroy-- defacing a Banksy as if somehow that elevates them to his status is, is just laughable. - Yeah. - Um, that that's what you need to do. - He's got a good kind of political message. - He seemed to be kind of very much on the button of what's going on in the world, I think, from the time when, you know, he went to-- what was it? The Thunder Bay ride in-in Disneyland and in-in-in that kind of figure of that one Guantanamo Bay detainee from that to going to the, the wall that separates Israel and Palestine it's always, you know, increasingly papist-- being stuff that's very much on the button and, and in the sort of political here and now. So I should think that will continue to be, you know, his next-- whatever it might be, may be something all about identity and unmasking, since that's the kind of-- that's been the latest story on "On The Story." - He could be a secret agent, couldn't he? He could be passing-- he could be passing messages onto his art to people all over the world. It's great, isn't it? - Yeah. - Absolutely. I mean, the thing, the thing-- the beauty about Banksy is he's all things to all men. Somebody turned around and said to me said-said, "Banksy's the nearest thing to Jesus we've got in this world today," I went to him, "Do you reckon?" He says, "Yeah," and funny enough, the person that said it is an atheist. - Who knows what makes him tick? He sounds like a very, very interesting character. - Yeah. - He sounds like an interesting human being, actually, just by-- because if we're to believe that he, which I hope is true, but again, I may be over romanticizing the whole thing, but if we're to believe that he goes and gives most of his, uh, profits to charity, then, wow, you know? - Yeah. - How can you, how can you fault-- It's almost like it's, it's another comeback onto society because you, you know, society begins to, to sort of, you know, want to build somebody up and then when they're pretty much at the top of the flagpole you start chopping away at it. - I mean, to me it was the perfect, as I said, perfect marriage in the-- between the traditional institution and the city and him, and it wouldn't have had the same power if he'd had done it in Tate Modern. I mean, it would be completely different. Uh, but the fact that he wanted to work in, in the museum in the way he did was incredibly unexpected, I think, to most people. So, yes, I think it's showing that he can surprise-- the scale of it was phenomenal. I mean-- and, yes, he invested so much of his energy and resources into that show. It was just incredible. They were-- his team were incredibly hardworking and professional. And, you know... So it was not an amateurish performance. It was a huge machine. And, so, yeah, he-- I-- he's made me realize that he could do whatever he wanted. So, yeah, maybe he'll come out and surprise us again or, maybe he'll go underground for a bit. I mean, the Bristol show was his biggest show he'd done and certainly hadn't show work in the UK for years before so, not-- definitely not on that scale. - Well, I understand Banksy is a, uh, an artist who's known for his street art, and, uh, he does some amazing work. Uh, whether you see it as, um, some form of vandalism, uh, of the environment, I suppose is a personal view. Uh, the quality of his work is outstanding... - Um... but my view is that, uh, he's usually very careful where he, where he performs his art. - The reason he wants to protect his identity is because the commercial value that it gives to his work. And, so, it's very difficult to see that his right to a private life-- his right to a family life would be invaded by an investigative journalist saying, "I've done these researches, and this is who I think this man actually is." And if that happened, then he'd probably just have to bear the consequences. - I imagine Banksy choosing not to allow people to know who he is was slightly accidental to begin with, um, and then very quickly looked like a-- look-- um, it became irresistible or charming and it must be wonderful to be Banksy and to be able to walk amongst us mortals knowing, um, that he-- that he has this kind of, um, massive fame. - There's no legal right to know who somebody is. I mean, Banksy's problem, for example, in some cases, if he wants to enforce the rights to which he's entitled, for example, his copyright, he's gonna have to reveal who he is. Now, it may be that as a-- as a logistical matter, it's possible to do that under conditions of confidence that meant that no one outside of the, the legal action involved, will be able to know who he in fact was, but it would be an obstacle-- a-a-a very difficult obstacle for him to overcome, because generally speaking the rule is that if you come to the law, you aught to be doing so in public. That-that-that law should be-- that justice should be seen to be done in public and therefore the general principle is that you-you don't protect these kinds of-of things. But, a-- as a, as a general rule, um, he doesn't have to tell us who he is and why-- and why should he? We're all private citizens within, uh, the state. This is information that we retain for ourselves. Why should it be revealed? Sometimes we're gonna need to rely upon it for our own reasons, but it's very difficult to see why the law would require-- the civil law at least, would require you to identify who you are. Of course, as a practical matter, often we do need to identify who we are... ...getting a driving license, getting a passport, of course, there's a difference between saying, "This is who I am," and saying, "And I am the person known as Banksy." - Mm-hm. - That's-- You know, he can't have two separate personas from that point of view and it not make a particular difference. I think the people around him, though, are very cynical. Why? - Um, you know, I'm not, you know, I do find that, um... um... I think they're probably more protective of him and his brand and the way he moves forth than he is. And I-I-I-I do have quite a lot of the inside track-- I lived in L.A. for awhile and I kind of know that there was a big bust-up between Banksy and the people who worked with him over the amount of money they took from the L.A., um, L.A.-- L.A. show that made him so popular in America. Copyrighters are purely property rights. It's all about the money. That's the only issue that arises. There are connected rights that sort of lay above it, or perhaps more appropriately, one might say, underlie it-- moral rights, so the right to be identified as the author. I think it says something about Banksy that he wanted to give that interview. It was-- he was doing his first ever, um, exhibition at a gallery, and so he obviously want-- decided he wanted a better publicity at that stage, but I don't think he's ever given an interview since. Lot 270, the Banksy. "You Told That Joke Twice." And I'll start this at, uh, 85-- 90-- 95,000. - And therein lies one of my biggest problems in the urban art movement that you've got a lot of these artists, a lot of whom are very talented, and a lot of whom I have to say are not as talented as people say they are because they're trying to make them into something that they're not, but in both cases they are being cash cow'd, they're being milked, and that's not fair. It's not fair for the artist. It's not fair for the artwork. It's definitely not fair for the buyer. And any person who seems to be benefiting out of it is predominantly the, uh, you know, the-the-the dealer or the agent. Yes, at 95,000 pounds. It's at 95,000 pounds. Automatically people started saying, "That's worth a lot of money." And then it's like, all right. And then you think, uh, like that guy who come on the telly that same sort of week and he covered his one up in plastic. And it kind of didn't look quite right, did it Chris? It was like, "What would you do that for?" You know, you cover it in plastic protecting it, and then you're selling it. It kinda takes away what it is actually there for, doesn't it? I mean, it's there-- I mean, I've found people who spray on top of it. They're only doing what the first person did, and if they--that's kind of a freedom, isn't it in a way? Yeah. - To do that. So it's not-- it's not our business if someone sprays over the top of it, you know? 95,000 pounds. Who said more than 95? Sorry. - 100,000. Thank you very much. Even the same with houses, you know, people allegedly cutting sides of their houses out. There's a reason why he would've selected that environment, and it just seems sad that someone would choose to remove it. 120, I have 130. The interesting thing about art in a way when you think about it is that it's an area-- a uniquely capitalist area, the value of the piece is entirely determined by how many people want it versus how many of them are available, and in a sense you could say, "The more people want it, the more popular it is, the more valuable it is"-- relative term. Of course, that argument must breakdown at some point because otherwise, the best pieces of art or the most valuable pieces of art would be the most popular pieces of art, and it doesn't always follow that way. Some pieces of art are more valuable even though they have a very niche appeal, but, there's-- you know, art is in a way a uniquely capitalist or a particularly capitalist field of endeavor. The value of what you do is precisely determined by the scarcity and demand of, um, your products versus the interest in those products. 140? [bidding continues] - When you buy art, I mean, it's-- I mean, I suppose that's pretty much the the fundamental problem that I've got is that, you know, we're, you know, we're talking about all art as investments, you know? And don't get me wrong, I'm not, you know, I'm not airy-fairy, you know, happy-clappy kind of guy that I'm thinking, you know, well, let's all buy art, you know, for the sake of it because it's, you know, it's beautiful and it's salvation to our spiritual, you know, spirituality. And, not-not-not at all. We live in a world, myself included, where you want value. You want to know that what you've bought and acquired is gonna have some kind of value in addition-- I'm talking economic value now-- hardcore money I mean, not in addition to all the elements which is the reasons why I hope people are buying, but I also appreciate and understand because I did it myself that there also has to be an element of value attached to it that you-- you're not gonna go and buy something for 15,000 and then find that at the end of the year pretty much everyone around you knew it was gonna end up being a hundred quid because it was-- it was just valueless, but with the kind of artists that we represent and work with and sell I mean, I-- that's quite unlikely. But it is a risk, of course it's a risk. Everything's a risk. The world is a risk. I mean, when you buy something and there's no guarantee. You buy property in the middle of Bulgaria today, who's to say it's not gonna be worth half the value in five years? You know, we can't control anything, you know, what happens, feast, famine, plague, war. I mean, you know? At 140,000 pounds for the Banksy. [unintelligible] Selling for 140,000 pounds. [unintelligible] - Thanks so much. - Of course. We're in Clerkenwell Road. What's behind us? It was a Banksy. I believe it's just been taken off the wall. How much was it sold for? I-I don't know. I mean, it's... it's between my landlord and whoever bought it. You haven't heard any amounts of money being mentioned? No, I haven't. No. When did they start removing it? About three weeks ago-- three or four weeks ago. Where is it going to? I believe it's a private collector. So he's gonna... He's bought it off my landlord. He's found some people to take it off the wall, and he's taking it off the wall. What you think about this? I'm quite glad it's going, actually. It saves my fence, 'cause too many people go-go-go-go, uh, go over the fence trying to... trying to have a look at it. Mr. Banksy might pop back and do another piece here. Yeah, if-if-if-if he's there-- if he watches this, could he just put it right on my grill so I can take them off nice and easy? [both chuckling] If he did your grills, that should be what, at least 50- 60K, shouldn't it? Well, I think so, yeah. And then that-- it's good for your business, isn't it? Well, yeah, but we can take 'em down pay for some miniaturized ones which would save me a lot of backache. I was getting a bit upset at people going over the fence. My fence was all smashed out because people were climbing over to take pictures of it. In front of the steel was all-- was all-- was all broken. Art students going over the top. Unofficially off the backdrive, I think it was by the ground. It's in Liverpool, apparently... What is it they were trying to take off the wall? I don't know. I don't know. He asked-- he came in, this customer of mine is paparazzi, actually, and he came in and he said he's got a friend up in Liverpool where Banksy did some work up there and-and-and he's gonna try and take it off the wall, but it's part brick and part render, so he's gonna have more of a trouble than these guys here. He's gonna paint the whole area... Oh right. ...and make good and provide my landlord with-with a-- with a life-size-- I think-- I-I-I think it was, from what he tells me, it's about a grand. That's not a lot. It's not, but he-- he bought it... Really? - Yeah. He just spent a long time in trying to find the right people to take it off the wall. Well, it's just not an easy job, is it? Two main galleries of dealing in his artwork is obviously, uh, Laz Inc.-- Lazarides who...was...is... I still can't work it out, his primary dealer, and, um... seems to be doing very, very well, and, you know, seems to be very well put together, clever guy and getting on with, you know, with supporting Urban arts and artists, and he seems to be very pivotal. He's got a good eye, I'll say that for him. He's got a very good eye for what he does. Um, and ourselves, and of course, there're a lot of other, you know, what I call "Bedroom Dealers," you know, the on-line gallerist and the guys who are sort of private, you know, sitting on their couches with a mobile phone and a Wi-Fi connection to the mobile and dealing in art, but, I mean, then there's one or two very nice guys out there who do that, but the majority of them I question mark because they're kind of hawking his artwork as a-- as a commodity, as an investment. I mean, I had lunch with one two weeks ago who will remain nameless, but it was the most surreal lunch, I think, I've-I've had in a long time. It was-- Lunch lasted an hour-and-a-half. The guy did most of the talking. I sat back and listened, which is quite unlike me as you can, you know, see I'm nice and verbose and... and I got back and I-I-I-- and I said to, you know, to-to-to my colleagues here-- to my staff I just said, "We could've been talking about barrels of oil. "There was no discussion about the artist, Banksy. "There was no discussion about the artworks. "There was no discussion about people buying. It was a commodity-traded discussion." You know, I buy at sixty and I sell it at a hundred. There was that kind of conversation. It was very sad. I mean, I don't want to be... I mean, I'm in it, but I don't want to be, you know, it's not even that we don't want to be blatant about it, it's-it's just not our M.O. - Recently we heard of someone who got their barer-- the kind of-- whatever-- their trading barer graffitied over and-and someone recognized it was a Banksy and gave the guy 15 grand in cash or something for it, and everyone thinks it was terribly clever. They cut out the piece of work and they, um-- and-and apparently it's worth a lot, and I'm sure that it's still a very good investment, but for me the idea of cutting out a piece of work from the environment that it had been painted in defeats-- it shows a fundamental lack of understanding about what Banksy's about, um, at the very least have the good sense to leave the piece intact. - He paid someone to do a caravan and then after it's worth 3 million. Very cool. 96,000 pounds... [laughter] 97,000, 98,000. 98,000 have you. ...99,000? [laughter] 98,000 in the room... Any further interest at 98,000? Are you sure? I'm selling. At 98,000 pounds. [gavel pounds] Thank you very much, sir. Congratulations... [applause] That's 45,000 for it. Okay, and like you said it, that's what it is and I don't-- I'm not gonna... I've narrowed it down to that. That's 45,000. This one is, you know, that's 16 and, you know... But these are opinions. - Yeah, yeah. These are my opinions... - Yes. ...that I think, you know, having done a little bit of homework, I hope, and having had open discussions with, you know, with my team that you kind of build a kind of ballpark figure of where you think the fair market value is. Yeah. But it's not about, you know, saying to people that "Well, I've bought these, I bought them at 700 pounds, and I'm--and-and I reckon I'll let them go when they're a hundred thousand." I mean, it's... you know, that's, that's just commodity speak. We're talking about, "What do we think is the fair price of selling, you know, a Banksy, a deface, a Giorgio, whatever, to our clients?" What's the right price? Where is it a win, win, win? It's not about, you know, it's not about killing off the client and making as much money as you can. Which, unfortunately, a lot of-- especially in the consumerist world that we're living in, in this very bullish, very capitalist world that we live in is very much about that, is what can you get away with? That's most people's mantra now is, you know, is what can we get away with. It's not about, "What can we get away with?" "Hey let's look out for the client, because if we look after the client will then come back to us again and again and again, because they'll feel comfortable." And whilst we could've made a killing for half a million with a client on the first time, and then maybe if you're lucky do another one the second time, it's not gonna, you know-- but you'll never see the client again. Whereas our philosophy is that, "Hey, wouldn't it be great "if we can work with that client for 20- 30 years because we'll make a hell of a lot of money than, you know, than a half a million a pop?" In the long-term. You know, you're actually talking about a feeling rather than a particular thing, aren't you? No, I'm an anarchist. So when you go and buy-- yeah, but when you go and buy a Banksy, you're actually buying a particular feeling. You're buying sarcasm and, you know, and somebody's rebelling against and being clever, so, you're not actually buying a piece anymore, are you? You're actually buying-- it doesn't matter which one you buy, they all got the-- you're saying they all got the-- a lot of people kind of say the same thing about every one. Hm. I don't think he's being sarc-- he's being a bit rebellious, and he's infiltrating into buildings. So you're not actually buying a piece, you're buying someone infiltrating into buildings. You're buying an idea. So it doesn't really matter whether it's a rat or a cat, you-- you're buying, you're buying sarcasm. That's right, yeah. And besides the artist, you're buying something else, right? You're actually buying a bit of their personality really, aren't you? Whereas before, wasn't it more about buying a piece? - The reason I made the film was really, as I said earlier, when someone's famous, what is real anyway? What the fuck is real, um, about their lives? Almost nothing is real. Um, and, um... you could see why alcoholism and drug use and everything is so rife. It's just nothing... there's nothing real in that-- not just in fame but in money, there is nothing nicer about... there's nothing nice about sitting in a boat. - I think what he does is quite creative. Is graffiti art or a crime? Whether is what he's doing right? I mean, kids spray painting on walls is it...? Depends whether they're doing wrong or right. Already we can... you can see that he's changed the way huge numbers of people think about A. Graffiti and B. Art. I think he's made a great deal of people rethink their views on graffiti, people that before just thought it's kind of an eyesore, it's Urban blight. You know, it's associated with bits of cities where it's dangerous or you can't walk around at night or whatever. I think Banksy and others, but perhaps chiefly him, have changed that view and have got so many more people interested and appreciative of graffiti, you know, researching for that book and writing about graffiti for Venue Magazine and Bristol, I've realized that all different groups of society that before probably, why they're unaware of it or took a dim view of it now say, "Yeah, I like it. "I walk around my local bit of Bristol and look out for what's come up next." You know, this is school children, women in their 60s, whoever. I think that's a relatively recent thing and it's part of the Banksy effect that lots of people suddenly think, "Uh, yeah, this art goes up on our streets "and it's really interesting and it's fascinating seeing "what's going up next. And, this bit makes me laugh. This bit makes me think about, you know, the war in Iraq," or whatever it might be. So I think he's massively changed the way we look at graffiti, and I think he's probably-- will be seen to have changed the way we look at art as well. Maybe we'll have a less kind of hierarchical view of art that you don't have to have kind of been to the Royal College of Art and, you know, have an intimate knowledge of art from Giotto to Mono to actually produce something worthwhile and amazingly artistically strong and valuable. So I think he's turned a great many more people onto both graffiti and art than before. Do you know, does the post office control that wall? I swear I, I swear I really don't know, mate. I mean, I was talking to my managers today and they were saying that, um, basically, it's a bit of a hazard with fans that are coming in and out all day, and, of course, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. We went to town around 10 o'clock and I come back in the afternoon. Went upstairs, I come home When I see somebody come back at 4'oclock the scaffold was gone And that was then, I thought to myself, "Wow, that's what I like" Sunday morning, I was going back to church, and then I saw somebody put scaffolding around the corner and I wonder what it is? And they come back later about 12:00, and I-I see-- I-I-I see somebody inside, 'cause it was all-- it was all-- it was all covered in, it was all like, you know, like blacked out, and, uh, you couldn't see what was going on behind it. Then 4:00 come back and we seen what it was. I looked at it this way. Look, they must've... They, they-- I wanted... There as-- there'd be people up there with the lights red as if it'd been attached to the wall. Did the post office check their CCTV, to see whether-- to know whether they actually captured him and his boys doing it? What I heard that happened, it happened over the weekend, and Saturday afternoon-- Saturday night in here is dead. All we've got is security, probably two people. Yeah. And what happened, they come in the front... Mm. ...of scaffolding line with some sort of, um, paperwork saying that they wanted to clean the walls. [chuckles] Right? And so this scaffolding went up and it was covered in tarp. We're alternative funeral directors, Heaven on Earth in Bristol, and it must be five or six years ago we did actually deliver-- uh, it wasn't at the same time, but during the same year we delivered two coffins for Banksy to spray for obviously friends of his who had died. Uh, one was for a pub landlady who had vodka bottles and various other things sprayed on to her coffin, and the other must've been a close friend. All I can remember was on the actual coffin he'd sprayed "No More Lies, Truth Time," and this is what people saw as the coffin was lowered into the crematorium. So we didn't... we didn't know how mourners would take it, but it went down very well because, as I said, that was what he used to say all the time, and Banksy had sprayed that on the coffin. It was older '80s. It wasn't stencils. He'd done like freehand, yes. Um, they didn't look like stencils to me, but, um, yeah, more the '80s style. Are there no photos of these copies? There are no photos, unfortunately, no. I think at the, um, landlady's funeral, Paul McGann actually did the, the speech at the funeral. So... Banksy obviously moves in the right circles. So there were two coffins he did? There were two coffins, yes, that, um, he did. They were just plain. We supply plain coffins without any varnish or anything on them-- called in the white. Uh, and of course, they're easy to spray and, uh, yeah, he did a great job on them. When did it strike you that you knew that this... did you know-- when you delivered the coffins, did you know they were going to him and that was kind of.. We knew that Banksy was going to do them. He had, you know, he obviously had a little bit of a name in Bristol, um, but certainly not the international acclaim that he has now, and, you know, he seems to be on everyone's lips and people paying hundreds and thousands for his works, but, um, we knew of him certainly, and, uh, we knew that we had to deliver the coffins and pick them up without meeting him. So we knew it was a bit hush hush, and, uh, it all added to it, I suppose. Yes, it was, uh... So when did the penny drop for you? When did you sort of think, "Okay, that was Banksy" and that, like we supplied it to him and did, you know, your sort of interest heighten a little bit? Well, obviously when he got more popular-- when he got more famous when he was appearing on the national news and we think, "Oh wow, we actually, uh, you know, "we actually supplied something that he painted on and, uh, I wish we'd have kept them now," but, no, it was, uh-- they were great funerals and the coffins were appreciated by all friends and family. So it was, um, yeah, it was a great thing he did. It may not be, it may not be so obvious when you first look at it, right, but if you, if you look, if you look at the colors and every area where he, where he, where he does his does his graffiti, if you look at the area, when you look at what the social mix is and you look at what the-the density, if it's high density or high rise flats or something like that, he seems to be able to source what the right color scheme is for the particular piece he's going to do, what the subject matter is, right, where he's gonna put it. You know what I mean? And then, you know, and he's obviously gone and checking out the social mix of the area as well. Hm. So that piece looks... on the wall there, his idea for Batten Green. Hm. Maybe if-if he went somewhere else, it might not work. It wouldn't work at Mulholland Park. One of the things that gives me great pleasure is being involved with the Banksy theme. But I don't, um, I don't know whether I work, um, I effect-- I-I'm not as cynical about Banksy as some people seem to be. Um, I-I haven't invested in the emotional... a-a-any-- he's not my guru-- my political guru because as I said, his art is actually quite childish and his messages are quite childish, and there's nothing particularly sophisticated about a Banksy message. It's just a very clear piece of thinking on that, say, CCTV or, um, or the Arms Race. Or...um, It's just nice beautiful pieces of thought, but actually, um... it's not clever and so, um, it's not-- it's clever in the way it's delivered and in a, you know, they're more like jokes, um, environmental jokes, um, and they just give me great hope, you know, I go around and I just feel someone has a really nice independent thought and a really beautiful piece of execution. So I'm very happy to be involved in that. So when people look at a painting or look at something like that, it detracts 'em from all the goings around. They actually stand still. You can't go past that out there no matter how much of a hurry you're in, right, even if you're coming home and you've had a shitty day, you come past there and you get-- secret smile. You just smile to yourself. You know? Yeah, no it's... It's an incredi- it's an incredible thing and I find that children seem to be children and young people, even teenagers, teenagers like it and older people like it as well. And it seems, it seems to cross the age. Are we to blame? Are the auction houses and galleries like Andipa to blame for this phrase "Urban," because we're trying to do the one thing that I don't like doing, but I almost feel compelled to do which is try and give it some boundaries, try and put it in a box. It was done in this purpose to show Switzerland that the kind of open country and open to exchanges between different communities and artists and... Getting up at all hours and going out there and... And what happens when the police turn up? Yeah, definitely, yeah. Yeah, I mean, you speak to the artists and they get false documents and they show people documents and give 'em an extra half an hour and then, you know, I suppose it is quite exciting for them, isn't it, you know? And might the... what did it take to put the, you know... it's quite big, the flower? Yeah, there's scaffolding, yeah, there's scaffolding up there, you know, and it was done really quickly. [mixed chatter] It was through an approach that his people made to us at the museum. So, um, the first we knew about it was that he rang-- well, not him personally, but his people rang up the museum and I think they tried to speak to me, but I wasn't available, but they ended up getting hold of the exhibition's manager at the time and, uh, said that they were interested in working with us, and of course we all thought it was a bit of a joke at first. We thought, "Oh, yeah, who's this ringing us up saying it's Banksy wants to have an exhibition with you?" 'Cause it was just like-- we'd always-- we'd sort of said, "Oh, wouldn't it be great if we could work with Banksy?" But never thinking that he would work with somewhere like us. So, um, so anyway, when the call happened, the first I knew about it was that Phil came into my office and said, uh, "Banksy's people want to take me to New York." [chuckles] And of course, in local government museums, this doesn't happen very often. [chuckles] So anyway, I said to him, um, "Well, they must be serious then if they want to fly you to New York to see his show," 'cause he's got this... pet store on in New York at the time and, um, it was going down. It was only there for days. So, uh, they wanted to get him out there to see it, 'cause the proposal was to bring the pet store to Bristol. There's always this kind of sense of the kind of intruder I think, isn't there, like going into all these prestigious museums and art galleries in New York and putting up his artwork. I thought that was very kind of-- that was a very strong symbol of the kind of thing he does. It's kind of... it's sort of toppling the whole idea of authority, you know? I've got every right, every much right, to put my artwork up in this museum as anyone else. So, it's a very kind of democratic notion, I think. Yeah, I just sent out a general email saying, um, how do we feel about graffiti on the-- 'cause it's quite a nice big wall-- it's quite a nice canvas, if you like, for graffiti artists. And I would... It's just a general inquiry, would we mind having graffiti on the side of the building. And, um, this place is run on committee. So, uh, the committee said, "Well, that's fine." 'Cause they kind of like support him. They realize he's a young influxive young artist in the area and due to that-- I said, "Yeah, well you know. If it's not offending anyone." Uh, they did not mind at all. So, um... and then it just popped up. Obviously, you wouldn't like it on the side of the building if it had been a horrible thing. And like Chris was saying, you know, people are enjoying it in the area. So if it was horrible, we would've been scrubbing it off the wall probably, wouldn't we? Or people would've complained and then made us scrub it off the wall, you know? So someone else has gone over it, and there's nothing there that anyone's wanting scrubbed off, so that's welcome to be there, isn't it, you know? The first one happens to be a Banksy. 'Cause our email was local artists, "Are we okay to do some graffiti on your wall?" And we said, "Yeah, as long as it's-- as long as the neighbors enjoy it." Can you just describe what happened with the Banksy artwork that is on the side of your canvas please? What's happened recently, you mean? Um, it's been defaced. It's been, um, someone's come with a roller and some emulsion paint and, uh, defaced the flag... or the Tesco carrier bag. Why do you feel that's happened? Why? I have no idea at all. To me, I don't know. It seems like pure vandalism to me. How, um... how did the rat appear on the outside of the building? Uh, the rat, I'm pretty sure is a prank, actually, to be honest. I'm not convinced it's by him at all. Yes, we had this party, I think, if I remember where the project was a project called "Regeneration," and the idea was really to pass the new century over to some young artists and the topic was mostly graffitis. And this, uh, this show was followed, I mean, this lounge, it was a rave party actually, uh, where a lot of young people were invited, and, uh, this rave party was followed by a kind of conference on the legality of graffitis. And the project went over and the-- we-we-we kept the graffitis in the garage without really thinking of what was going to happen or whatever. The guardian had mentioned as well that we were due to whitewash the graffiti and that was definitely a plan, but I think the ambassador at the time thought it was rather nice to keep. So they burned whitewash. - We seem to be on the, uh, the Banksy tourist trail here, 'cause we have, uh, one of Banksy's works two doors down from us, and, um, I think Bristol has become a bit of a mecca for Banksy fans. - What's the piece that's just down from you then? - Um, that is the rifleman aiming somewhere with, um, a boy standing behind him just about to pop a, paper bag, which, uh, a bit of controversy when it first came since it's right opposite the children's hospital, but, um... Banksy being Banksy, I think people loved it more than loathed it. Do you like it? I like it, yes. I like him, um, I like his art, yeah. What do you think he adds to the city? Uh... A bit of fun. A bit of, you know, I mean, we have problem with-- problems with ordinary, uh, people who spray things, but this is, um, we call it "art," but it's, it's got a message, it's fun, it makes you think. So, I think it's, uh, a good addition to the city. What would you say to the media who want to reveal it? Party poopers and they're boring. I suppose that graffiti art is-is- is something that kind of empowers a lot of people because they don't wait for galleries to, you know, to allow them exhibit. You just go out and-and-and- and do your thing and so I guess when one person does it, um, encourages other people to do it. - He does direct action as well, doesn't he? 'Cause he walks in to the Tate and stuff and just puts his work up. - Yeah. Yeah, people like that, don't they? 'Cause it makes them feel like they could, they could be doing something like that too, everyone can do that. And he's not even using his name sometimes, is he? He's just doing it and it just happens to be him. And that means that you could-- anyone could do it. You could do it. Chris could do it. I think maybe that's why people like it. It gives them a bit of glimmer of something they could be doing, too. Don't need to be someone who's got a name or got contacts. You can just be clever and do it. A strength has always been the idea... I just remember speaking to one Bristol artist who said, you know, "I thought of similar things-- thought of doing similar things "to the kind of things that Banksy's done, but I haven't had those ideas. Or if I have, I haven't done them." And that's the thing with Banksy. I think it's- it's incredibly crisp, clear, witty, subversive ideas, and then it's just the kind of get up and go and the balls to go do them, around the world, in dangerous places, in foreign unknown places. The public's reaction was just amazing, overwhelming. I mean, it was just... showed amazing warmth to him and appreciation that he'd-he'd chosen to do this amazing event in Bristol. You know, he could've gone anywhere. He could've gone to New York, He could've gone, you know, to anywhere in the world, but he chose to do it in what is his hometown. Yeah. And to give Bristol a massive gift. Hm. And it was a massive gift of time, energy, resources, but also himself, 'cause as I say, I think he revealed, you know, other layers of himself through the exhibition inevitably, um, and added to the whole, um, persona of Banksy and the attachment that Banksy has to Bristol and Bristol to Banksy and started lots of new debates for the city and really put culture at the center stage for those months that he was there. I mean, for the time that the exhibition was on in Bristol, it was the biggest talking event in the city. It was seen as the biggest cultural event of the decade, you know, we had visitors from all over the world. I mean, you know, 350,000 people came to see it. They queued every day. I mean, it was a phenomena. Best of Warhol moves you. I'm not sure why. I don't think you'll ever know really without, uh, and on the whole Best of Banksy makes you smile. And I don't think that's enough to kind of turn you into... a great artist in the end. What do you think Warhol might've had to say about Banksy if-if he... He'd be jealous. He'd be jealous? Yeah. Why, because Banksy's have more success do you think? Or... He'd be...not more, but because... because he had success. I mean, you know like, I think... he thought of something that Andy didn't. You know, like, um... because that's the nature of Warhol's character. You know, is, um, very competitive in a way. I mean, Warhol is not a multidimensional, um, creature. You don't want to know him. That matrix, that cultural matrix was pretty toxic. Right. Um... Yet, I mean, I ran away from it. [chuckles] Right. Um, but I think Banksy, much healthier person. Warhol was for the '60s, but Banksy's is for the- for the-for the- for the two thou-- the, the two thousands. Right. Because what he's doing is he's... What Warhol was doing, he was using materials and, um, new-- new ideas back in the '60s, and there was new products coming onto the market for artists, like new paint color-- different colored paint and different colored pigments and all that, so Warhol cashed in on that. Well, what Banksy's done is, he's done a...he's-he's done- he's gone one step farther than what Warhol's gone. What he's done is, he's taken the society around him, this 24-hour society, and he's created an art form to go onto, to meet that. The question isn't really, how accepted is Banksy going to be by the art movement. It's more, um, how credible will he remain as he becomes more an establishment figure? He's already proved himself as an establishment figure. I don't know whether he sees himself as part of that world or not, because he isn't patronized by a gallery, um, or someone like Saatchi, but he does have people that buy his work. Celebrities buy his work and, you know, work, uh-- works of his are auctioned at very high prices. So he does participate whether he wants it or not in the, um, the art world, in that he makes money from it. And he gets his, um, you know, credibility by being part of it, or being anti it. Whichever way he's playing it really. Um, so he's an interesting addition, I think, to-- to the art-to the-the art world that we live in. And, um, yeah, he's-- his celebrity is part of that. I mean, contemporary visual arts is also concerned with celebrity as we know. Artists are celebrities and he's part of that. He may not be a celebrity that has his picture on the Hello magazine, but he's a celebrity because of the way he milks the media and plays the media means he's a celebrity. He's-he's been able to play the media, I think. He's been able to release as much or as little information that suits him, and-and each time with his kind of stunts it's always been the right place at the right time. So I, you know, to generate interest and intrigue. So I think he will continue to kind of play the media game ingeniously and skillfully, but, you know, I'm-I'm sure-- will it mean he will recoil from the public eye? I don't know. He's already pretty removed from it in a way, isn't he? So, I don't know what impact if any something like that story will have on how he works. It may not have any impact. It was a mystery buyer that bought 50 copies of the film. Really? Uh, yeah, and I am wondering... [laughing] ...um, whether...[chuckles]... whether that was, um, Banksy because, um, we got a huge order from that, um, from that one person up in... um, and I-I've been actually really good. I haven't looked at the name and the address. I decided just to let that, um, let that go, but, um, the, um, um, but I'm guessing that whoever is probably sending-- using those Christmas presents, I would do it if I was Banksy, 'cause it's amusing and it's an amusing piece of work. AK-47 said he wanted me to get in touch with Banksy to act as a hostage negotiator. So I said, "What'd you want?" He said, "Well, I want like 20,000 quid or something." I think it's a shame that people are desperately trying to unmask him is, is all. I think it... I think that in this day and age where everything, it seems, is kind of known. People are, if anything, are too known. You know, people are famous for doing very, very little, aren't they? I think that in this day and age someone being able to retain an element of mystery and anonymity is, is amazingly exciting and unusual. The only thing I have negative about it, if I was Banksy I might be thinking, "Do they like my work or do they like my mystery?" The moment he stopped surprising people would be the beginning of the end of the whole saga, I should think, but I think that's what he's been able to do all the time ever since, you know, he's-he's able to constantly, kind of, play with people's expectations and surprise people, and I-I-I think he'll continue to do that really. It's great what he's doing, 'cause he's given someone, something of people, for people to kind of focus on and, like we said earlier, you know, it makes 'em feel like they can do anything. You know, all you gotta do is think of a little, uh, you know, think out of the box, and, he's kind of opened-- opened things up for individuals which is great, you know? - Of course I will watch with interest to see what he... like what you said yourself, what he does next, because for me, that's part of the whole persona and the brand is like, what does he do next? Where does he go next? How does he top that? How does he-- What narrative does he want to create next? And yeah, he can do what he wants, I think, um, because, you know, the fact of the matter is the show only happened because he approached us and resourced it and our part in that was we said "yes" and we made it happen, and we worked with him in a way to enable him to have as much creative freedom as we could possibly allow him to. There's plenty of people out there who think Banksy is nothing. It's a waste of time. It's, you know, taking energy and resources and-and-and, you know, square centimeter column space away from other artists and there are other people who think exactly the opposite. They think, they herald him as a, as a great hero of the art world. I can't believe that he would slip from history completely because... Yeah. ...of the impact he's had, and obviously, uh, um, an exhibition like, that was held this year is going to be... just because of its popularity, I can't believe it would just disappear as phenomena.
