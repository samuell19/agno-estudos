KULIEV A Mosfilm Studio Production, 1936 Ten Red Armymen went into civvies having put their terms in Central Asia. They headed to the railroad to receive liberty passes in town and repair homeward. [They had three companions: the commander of the neighboring frontier station, his wife, and a geologist who joined them on the way.] How far is the well, Comrade Commander? - A well! - A well! It's filled up. Water is gone. It's recent. What son of a bitch could do it? We have to go back. What do you mean 'back'? I'm not here to entertain, young man. - I'm in a hurry! - Don't worry, Comrade Scientist. - We'll be there in time. - We'll certainly be. - Shall we, Comrade Commander? - Mount! Stand at the left flank please. Maria, join the ranks. Right dress! Attention! Comrade Commander, I can't stand at attention. Who is talking on parade? - Your name? - Gusev. - Yours? - Akchurin. Petrov. Levkoev. Sviridenko. Zhurba. Balandin. Muradov. Ata Kuliev. Timoshkin. Mine? It's Postnikov usually. Comrades, it's a five-hours ride to the next well. We aren't resting here. No time. You'll drink only at my command. We can go home even without drinking. Stop talking! I repeat: you'll only drink at my command. Clear? Any questions? Fall out! Pardon, can I speak now? You're welcome! Sorry for bothering you, Comrade Commander, but I don't understand. As far as I know, the Red Armymen are returnees. Logically speaking, they needn't listen to you. According to your own words, you're having a 3-months vacation. I'm a geologist. The lady is a civilian too. Why are you teaming us into some sort of a troop or a squadron or whatever you call it? I can neither stand at attention, nor fall out. - I refuse to understand it. - Don't worry. No problem. You'll learn to stand at attention, fall out, - And right dress. - But I don't want it! It's not allowed. You can in no way say so, Comrade Scientist. Forget the very word 'I don't want'. Clear? Mount! [From the south, the desert was frequented by the Basmachi and a burning hot wind, the "Afgani".] Follow me! Comrade Commander, follow me! It's here! Comrade Muradov! Let's check on the horses. Does anyone have water? - Just a sip. - Give it to him! There should be a well somewhere. The "Afgani" came suddenly, and as suddenly ceased. Got it! Timoshkin, Levkoev! Water! Plenty of water! The Maxims! They stored lots of cartridges. Comrade Akchurin, take care of the machine-guns. Comrade Sviridenko, explore the well. There's no water. It's gone. It's just mud. Drop a pot! There's some dripping. - How is it? - It's still dripping. Comrade Commander? The machine-guns are brand new. - From abroad? - Sort of. Sviridenko? How is it? It's dripping here! You see, we searched for water and found machine-guns. It's hot. Ivan, how long shall we stay here? Calculate yourself. A pot per person makes thirteen pots. And five pots per horse. - I don't like it all. - What? - Guns in the well. - Why? It's Basmachi. They'll come back to pick them up. Are you afraid? - I think we'd better leave. - Without water? I can't. Haul! Carefully. Seven and a half minutes per pot. Drop another pot! Comrade Commander! Everyone takes three sips. Aleksandr Petrovich, go ahead. Maria Nikolaevna, please. # In our village # there is a river. # A cold stream. Having a bucket in front of you, you don't seem to be so thirsty. Aren't you? You liar! - Thirty seven. - Thirty seven. It's the thirty seventh pot. Comrade Commander, can we water horses by the morning? Six buckets. Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty too. We don't have any water. I'll be so sorry to leave her. - So sorry! - To leave who? My girlfriend. The 375 rifle. It was made in 1891 at the Izhevsk armoury. Number 115 854. Here you are, bro! You should have felt sorry for it earlier. There's a scratch in the bore and some sand at the bullet chamber. I know! I have a better girlfriend. A beauty! Made in 1911. Eyes... like Maria Nikolaevna's. Smile... like Maria Nikolaevna's. Even better! You're lying! Shaitan! [devil] Comrade Commander, 3 horsemen are approaching! Halt! They left. Saddle horses. Hurry! Ivan, what was it? Scouts. The whole party will be here soon. Who is there? Comrade Commander, he's asking for water. Comrade Akchurin! Maria! Who is your leader? I don't know. Who is the leader? [Turkish] Shirmat Khan. Two days without water? Three days. - How many people? - Two hundred. - Did anybody have water? - No. We came here for water. Give us water! When is Shirmat Khan going to be here? In half an hour. Give us water! The Shirmat Khan's gang, 200 men. They didn't have water for 3 days. Let him go. - Comrade Commander. - I said let him go. Let him tell Shirmat Khan that there are the Red here; that they are few, and there is a lot of water. Go! - Are you in a hurry? - I am. - Don't hurry. - Why? Just don't. Belay mounting! Come here. Sit down Comrades. You too, Comrade Timoshkin. You know who Shirmat Khan is. A few days ago, in the village of Taudyr, he massacred 70 people, filled in the wells and left. We tried to capture him for a year, but we didn't succeed. We failed, because we didn't know where his wells are. Where he drinks. It's his well! He drinks here. Our people have searched for him near Nefes-Kula, but he's used this well. He hasn't drunk for three days, and his horses are thirsty too. He plans to drink here and leave. You know where to. Comrades, we can ensure that Shirmat Khan stays here forever. The only thing we need to do is to keep him here, at the well, till our friends come from Nefes-Kula. Clear? Make your decisions, Comrades. There's no water here anyway. How can he water 200 horses? Shirmat Khan doesn't know it! We didn't promise to show him the well, did we? He won't leave until he gets water. We have 10 rifles. Too few! - You forgot two machine-guns. - Good, Comrade Commander. Who volunteers to go to Nefes-Kula and inform them about our keeping Shirmat Khan here? - Me. - Me. Comrade Muradov, they say, you are an excellent rider? They do, Comrade Commander! They say you even won your saddle as a prize? Yes, Comrade Commander! Let him drink as much as he can, give him three flasks for the way and water his horse. Pour the rest of water to machine-guns. Unsaddle the horses! Comrade Zhurba, fill all the knapsacks with sand. If they aren't enough, use shirts and underwear. - You're in charge for the perimeter. - Yes, Comrade Commander. You should drink as much water as you can. Go ahead! It's not for you. Comrade Akchurin, Place the first machine-gun at that corner. Comrade Balandin, place the second machine-gun here, at this corner. Go ahead! It's a five-hour ride to Nefes-Kula. It's 22 hours now. Tell the squadron commander that I expect him at eight in the morning. You can go! Be careful, Comrade Muradov. Shirmat Khan is nearby. Do you know what happens to you and us, - if they capture you? - I do. Go. Comrade Commander, how long shall we stay here? Are you in a hurry? Like every old man, I'm hurrying to live. Aren't you in a hurry? No, I am on vacation! I see. In this case, can I help you? I'm waiting for orders. For example, I can stand at attention. Can you shoot? They are shooting at Muradov. He'll pass clear. He may. He will! We'll have to send another one. How? There's no water to give him. Go on working! Comrade Commander, I see them! Ready all! Attention! The first machine-gun, two strings of bursts! It's okay. Fire! They didn't like it! Comrade Commander, I see two riders! They are negotiators. Let them approach to 100 steps. Maria, do we have a brush? Good? Ivan, unbuckle your holster. Draw a bead at the gentleman. It's okay. Half Colonel Skuratov. Squadron Commander Zhuravlev. I have 600 men. You have 200. It's enough to smash you in half an hour. I don't know. Do you want to know the yielding conditions? Yes. Throw down your arms here and ride in this direction. Or in that direction. But without water. I need it myself. Good conditions. Very good conditions. We can make you a better offer. We are going to stay here and keep our guns with us. Is it clear? But we can give you water. A bucket per horse. Just think, 200 buckets of water. In exchange for the head of... Shirmat Khan! We can also give you a pot of water per person in exchange for your head, Half Colonel Skuratov. Unfortunately, your terms are unacceptable for us. I think it's a fair price. I give you five minutes to reflect, if you want to live. I give you five minutes to reflect, if you want to drink. Tell me, do they learn things like recollection or, let's say, brilliance - in the Red Army? - Certainly. Do they teach it? As a separate subject. Very interesting! They are about to attack us. They shouldn't take us alive. - Do you understand it? - I do. - Maria! - I'm not afraid. Now please do what I say. Try to stay over there. In a shelter. Yes, Comrade Commander! Comrade Commander, water is over! It isn't dripping any longer! - How much do we have? - Over a half of a bucket. Cherish it like an apple of your eye. You're responsible for every drop. Yes, sir. I'll cherish it. - What elevation is there? - Six. How are you, Comrade Balandin? - Fine. - Very good. Attention! They are ready. They're approaching, Comrade Commander. At my command. Shoot on your own. Use cartridges sparingly. I appoint Comrade Akchurin my understudy. Yes, Comrade Commander. Their machine-guns won't shoot for long. They don't have water. - You shouldn't worry. - You shouldn't either. Fire! They turned back! Stop fire! They retreated. What if they don't come back, Comrade Commander? They can't leave without water. We shouldn't face them down, or else they can leave. They may have other wells. No! They don't have any. They did leave. - Do you see them at the right? - Yes. Throw a couple of bursts. Do you think Muradov will make it overnight? Of course he will. It's a five-hours ride to Nefes-Kula or a twelve-hours walk. I'm sorry for the horses. We lost them. They were good horses. By the way, I had an incident with a horse at our station. The commander sent me with a postal packet. Where did he send you? To some place. So I went. And the night was pitchy dark. But I went on and on. Then my horse stopped and wouldn't go further. - Either back or forward. - Why didn't you dismount? I couldn't. It was in the middle of a mire. Then I saw something nearby. - Glittering? - No. Darkening. But I couldn't come closer. The horse wouldn't go. So I got off the horse. In the middle of the mire? Mire! I'd passed it already! You better listen. He's telling fibs again! Why should he lie all the time? Shut up! You'd better listen. We've nothing to do anyway. Okay, go on lying. I can't go on now. My muse is mute. You lied so excitedly. Stand by! They are attacking! Nine. It's an extra one. There are nine people left. Fire! Stop fire! Maria Nikolaevna, could you stitch up the bags? Mitya? Mitya, what is it? Stand by! Fire! Comrade Commander, They're carrying a white flag! Comrade Commander! I'm Comrade Commander! I'm the Commander! Listen to my command! It's for the negotiations. Let them approach to 100 steps. Comrade Timoshkin, go out and speak with them. Speak calmly. I order you to smile at the negotiations. Comrade Petrov! Stand properly before the commander! Where is your balalaika? Take it and play. Play merrily! Comrade Sviridenko, take the water from the well. Yes, Comrade Commander! - Is it all? - It is, Comrade Commander. Okay. We'll spare it as long we can. - Tell Commander I want him. - I substitute him. You see, he's just washed and is having tea. He ordered me to speak for him. Are you authorized to negotiate? I am. Half Colonel Skuratov. Timoshkin. Is it hot, Timoshkin? Not really. We're chilling out. They are washing. Pardon, are you maybe thirsty? Thank you. I am not. Just don't hold back please. By the way, your machine-guns are silent. Are they thirsty too? - You were 13, weren't you? - Yes. Are you now five? Is the commander drinking tea with the others? - He is. - Let's be brief. You water my people and horses and we leave. We won't touch you. You may stay here overwinter. Dear sir, it's too bad! Why didn't you say it yesterday? We'd have agreed. By jingo we'd have. But out prices have changed today. You are slow goods, you know. But we'll give you water. One bucket of water for the head of Shirmat Khan. As for you, we'll break even: Pot for pot. I'm not joking! I'm serious too. Very well. In this case, I don't recommend you to surrender! Interesting! We're going to capture you alive. Enough! I can't stand it! Tell them that there is no water here! Shut up! Hey you, listen! There's no... Leggo! Leggo! Hey you, listen! Quit hold of his head. Water, give water! Don't get nervous, my dear. Calm down please. I beg you. Please! Why are you shouting? Who are you shouting to? To the officer. They will hear you and leave. We tried to catch them for a year. Give it a good thought please. Do it quietly. Very quietly. Stand up! Comrade Timoshkin, give me water! Have a drink, Comrade Petrov. Halt! Back! Akchurin, he'll get away! He won't. Comrade Timoshkin, use the water for machine-guns. If some is left, cherish it like an apple of your eye. Yes, Comrade Commander! It's my turn. How shall I handle it? Correctly. Don't hurry, Comrade Scientist. Don't pull the trigger. Just single an aim and lead the bead from below. Point the bead at the aim, Comrade Scientist. Align the sightline. The bead should overlap the sighting notch. Pull the trigger slowly and don't worry. Is it clear, Comrade Scientist? No, it isn't. Firstly, I can't help worrying. Secondly, it's very sophisticated. I can explain it. First of all, stop worrying. Secondly, the sightline should go from your eye through the sighting notch and the bead to the target aim point. - Is it clear, Comrade Scientist? - Yes, it is. But when looking at the bead, I loose the target. Looking at the target, I loose the bead. I think it's a natural property of the eye, isn't it? No. It has nothing to do with your eye. You should hate the target. Just try and hate the target. Then you'll hit it without fail. But the bead should be aligned with the sighting notch. Stand by! Water... Water... Shirmat Khan. There. Twelve of our people. Follow my trail. You'll find my rifle and saddle. - Please hurry. - Go ahead! He was a good old man. A scientist! A man of letters! He was kind. - He was married. - Was he? Of course he was! It isn't so boring here when you're two. Of course not! Talk to me, Timoshkin. You know, I'm very sorry for Maria Nikolaevna. She was a good woman! A remarkable woman! She felt sorry for the Commander. She carried water. Do we have any? Half a pot. Cherish it as an apple of your eye, Timoshkin. Don't touch it without my command. Yes, Comrade Commander. - Timoshkin! - Yes? - Talk to me more, Timoshkin. What shall I tell you? It's nothing to talk about. - I could tell a fib though. - Please do. Okay. Once I went along the street at night. Suddenly, a window opened at the other side. And I saw... A beautiful girl in the window. Dressed in white. She stood and smiled. Interesting! Timoshkin! Don't joke like that! Timoshkin! Don't joke please. Okay, come here, Come here, bastards! Come here, bastards! You won't get me! Go ahead! Yusuf Akchurin, a returnee Red Armyman. Heading home. Thank you for your service. Ready to be of service to the workers! Our neighbor is here. We did warn you that we would capture you alive. And what did you do? Water... It's something we don't have. There's no water here. I wanted to tell you that you were trying in vain, but I was too busy. It was bad luck. People of our division: Petr Sviridenko, Dmitry Levkoev, Ata Kuliev, Nikolai Gusev, Aleksei Timoshkin, Balandin, Zhurba, Commander Zhuravlev of the frontier station, his wife and comrade-in-arms, and scientist Comrade Postnikov lay in the bed of honor as commendable children of the Socialist Motherland. Remember their names! ??? The end
