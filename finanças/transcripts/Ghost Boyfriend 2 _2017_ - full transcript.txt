Reach the spirit world via my body. Bed fairy, please show yourself. Reach the spirit world via my body. Bed fairy, please show yourself. My name is Shao Tang. I'm a psychic laying low in the city. I can communicate with the spirit world. This is my bar, also a junction of spiritual and human world. Please give me a cup of ice water. Miss, it's very cold out, have some warm water. No, ice water. Thank you. Miss, how are you? I'm fine. If there's anything on your mind, you can tell me. Maybe I can help. You wouldn't believe me anyway. If you don't tell me, how would you know? If I said I saw a ghost, would you believe me? Boss Shao isn't working, but flirting? I'm communicating. I'm bonding with the customers. Cup of orange juice. Miss, ghosts don't exist. All the monsters are pure fiction, thought out by humans. It's getting late, we should close. Please go home. Go home. No, my place is haunted. See, no one'd believe such a thing. Don't worry about him, I believe you. Shao Tang, I'm warning you. Don't get involved. I have my personal freedom. You can't tell me what to do. Why don't you want me involved? I just don't. You owe me 5000 yuan. Then you can't stop me. Try me. I just will. Do it. Do it. Guys… Forget about him. Tell me your story. I'll help you. Really? Who are you? Don't matter. I'll help you. I'm Su Yu, a copywriter for a film company. I met a barber half a year ago. We got along well. Last month we started living together. Yu, your hair's beautiful. What's more beautiful? Me or my hair? You. Zhang Yang, will you comb my hair forever? I will. Yu, I'm back. Zhang Yang, come here. What happened? See for yourself. Whose hair is this? Other than me, what other woman are you hiding? Yu, what are you talking about? Zhang Yang. Do you think you live in the old era, where it's still polygamy? You want another wife? Yu, I don't know what you're talking about. I was cleaning the washroom today, and I found this. This isn't my hair. Whose is this? Are you trying to think of an excuse? I really don't know whose hair this is. Maybe it's the former owner's. You think I'm three? When I moved in, I cleaned the entire place myself. There wouldn't be a trace of dust. Zhang Yang, we've only lived together for weeks and you brought others back already? Yu, I swear. I didn't take anyone home. I only love you. Then where did the hair come from? When I'm at work during the day, who knows what you do. Yu, I get home later than you do. If you don't believe me, check the building's cameras tomorrow. I never came home during the day. Zhang Yang, I'll check tomorrow. What's wrong with you, Yu? I'm fine. Rest early. Yu, Yu, what's wrong? Zhang Yang, you're finally back. Yu, it's okay, it's okay. I'm back. Tell me what happened. Zhang Yang, this place is haunted by ghosts. Look, there are a bunch of women’s long hair. Yu, nothing's there. Zhang Yang, it was just there. And when I was cleaning the room today, I found so much long hair. It's probably yours. No, they're not mine. Yu, are you too stressed? No, Zhang Yang, you have to believe me. This place really is haunted. Yu. It's time for your meds. Take them. You're too stressed recently. Too suspicious. It's not bitter, take them. Hey, tell you something. A friend of mine rented a place a few days ago. She said that when she rented the place, the landlord didn't tell her it was haunted. She encountered strange things those days. For instance, when she woke up the next morning, she found herself on the floor. Seriously? Yeah. What a terrible landlord. What happened after? Then an expert said, fairies also reside at that place. She offended the bed fairy, so she had to ask the bed fairy personally. Followed the fairy's instructions, and burnt incense sticks to calm the fairy. How do you talk to the bed fairy? You need to lie in bed, with only one thought: calling out to it, then it will appear. Sounds iffy, does it work? I heard it works. An expert said, fairies also reside at that place. She offended the bed fairy, so she had to ask the bed fairy personally. Reach the spirit world via my body. Bed fairy, bed fairy, please show up. Reach the spirit world via my body. Bed fairy, bed fairy, please show up. That's it. I ran and ran, for who knows how long. Had no idea where I was. I ran till my mouth was dried out. I saw a bar, and came in. From what you said, you called out the bed fairy, and now it wouldn't leave. Yes, is she a ghost? Bed fairy is a kind of spirit, that's bound to the bed for some special reason. It uses bed or puppet as a medium to communication with humans. To be precise, it's not a ghost. How can you help me? I didn't say I'd help you. It hurts. My boyfriend should be home any minute. I'm worried that accidents will happen to him. Don't worry, I'll go home with you to see. Really? My grandfather and dad were celestial masters. They drive away evil spirits. The kick zombies' ass too. They caught ghosts and killed demons. My family's experts in this area. What are you doing? I have a toothache. Endure it. Thank you, let's go. Stop, if you dare go, interest will be added for this month's debt. Don't be so mean. A great man once told us to treat comrades with warmth. You're gay. You're gay. Let's go. Master, how much does it cost to catch ghosts? For free. But, I want something on you for exchange. What? Your life span. Life span. Don't worry, it'll only cost you one year. It won't affect you much. Shao Tang, hold on. Miss Su, my car's over there. Get in the car and wait. I need to talk to Shao Tang. Ok. Shao Tang, don't mingle in this matter. I won't borrow her life span. Zhou, you don't have much time left. Don't risk it. Zhou, why don't you? Miss Su's soul matches yours perfectly. Why not try it? I'm worried about your safety. How about I go with you? Ok. Don't worry, we're here. Yu, you're back. Zhang Yang, are you okay? I'm fine, they're… Zhang Yang, they're my friends. They know about exorcism. I told them everything. Let them take a look. Yu, I told you, ghosts don't exist. You haven't taken your meds today. Take the meds first. Take them. Guys, it's pretty late, so I won't ask you to stay for tea. Please go home. Zhang Yang, this place really is haunted. I'm not hallucinating. Yu, don't do this, listen to me. First of all, ghosts don't exist. Secondly, ghosts will leave if we’re not afraid of them. I'm here, right? Zhang Yang, I'm afraid the ghost will hurt you. You two saw it, too. Yu has been stressed recently. Please don't scare her anymore. Mr. Zhang, since we’re here anyway, let us go in and have a look. This is my home. If you don't leave I'll call the police. I'll sue you for trespassing. Zhang Yang. Ok, let's go. Zhou Jun Chi. Miss Su, don't worry. I had a look, this place isn't haunted. We probably scared it away. This is my number. If there's anything we could help with, you can contact us anytime. But I always feel unease. Miss Su, don't worry. Tonight will be a peaceful night. Shao Tang, let's go. Zhou. Listen to me, let's go. Zhou, there's something weird with Zhang Yang. There's nothing wrong with him. Zhou, why don't you believe me? Get off. I moved in to your place already. What for? Well, it's not easy to earn money. Are you happy that I moved in? Ha ha. Zhang Yang, why don't you believe me? This place really is haunted. Yu. I believe you. Be good. I'll get the meds, take them first. When I find a place, we'll move together. Really? Then hurry up and find a place. I really don't want to live here any longer. OK, don’t be scared. I’m here. I’ll get the meds. Take the meds first. Done. Ting Ting, where's my blanket? I took it to the laundry. They'll be ready in a few days. Then how would we sleep? Together. Or do you want to sleep with me? Uh no no no no no. Two men sleeping together, what's the problem? Zhao Ting Ting, what are you doing? Shao Tang wouldn't be comfortable sleeping with me. But he wouldn't be comfortable sleeping alone in the living room, either. It's so cold outside. OK, I'm going back to the room. You two go to bed soon. Don't come out. How would we sleep? Like this. Not like it's the first time. Zhou, seriously. We haven't slept together in years. I'm not quite used to it. How about you sleep in the living room? Don’t you know how to properly be a host? No, who'd know? Your dad, or your grandfather. I only know when someone's being disrespectful. Living room, please. Get out. Yu, take the meds. Shao Tang, I beg you. If it's telling me to stay out of this, save it. Shao Tang. Stay out of this. Do you know how dangerous this is? Zhou, you've known me all these years. Have I ever been afraid of danger? Shao Tang, maybe this is destiny. I don't want you to get hurt because of me. Zhou. Your body is too fragile for this. I can't watch you get doomed. There's not much time left. I must help continue your life. We'll think of a way for the rest. Zhou. I just want to be with you forever. Shao Tang. But we've failed so many times. Zhou, if you really care about me. Stay with me. With our revolutionary friendship, nothing stands in our way. I don't believe that I can't beat God's will. Ok. I believe you can feel it too. Su Yu's place has no evil spirits. But a spirit was once there. So you suspect the evilness isn't the spirit. Perhaps the spirit is warning us. Have you noticed. Zhang Yang keeps letting Su Yu take meds? Maybe the meds is the problem. The meds, so it's not evil spirits who want to harm Su Yu, it's Zhang Yang. Shoot, then Su Yu's in danger? Shao Tang, what are you doing? I'm going to Su Yu's. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Ting Ting, what are you doing? Uh. I, I, I'm afraid that Shao'd be cold. I wanted to ask if you needed… No. Shao Tang, wait for me. What are you doing? I'm been sick worried about you. Zhang Yang, I feel dizzy after taking the meds. I wanted to let you live for a few more days. I didn't expect you getting help. Then I have to let you go earlier. Zhang Yang, what have you done? Have you been lying to me? Su Yu, you're just a container. Now it's time to show your value. Uh oh, I don't have the key. Awkard. Cut the shit, just go through the wall. We're in human bodies now. What then? I have an artifact. You practice a lot. The ghost in the house is my girlfriend Mei Lu. She died of a terminal illness. I want to resurrect her through your body. Let's go. Stop. Help. Help. Where's Zhang Yang? I lost him. It's a trap. Let's go. We're too late. Tang, we only have this. Shao Tang, it's been a long night. Eat something. What's the matter, you're unhappy? Zhang Yang is just an ordinary person. Teleportation isn't easy for him. When I was chasing Zhang Yang he couldn't. But Miss Su was already killed. Maybe the mastermind isn't Zhang Yang. Shao Tang, this is now beyond our control. Shao Tang, let's stop here. Your safety is most the important. I don't want you to get into any accidents. Zhou, when did you become like this? This isn't like you. He's only like that to people he likes. Ting Ting, cut the nonsense. Ting Ting, we're pure. We've been friends for over 2000 years. Zhou, this… I can't. This is the only chance. If I miss it, I need to wait for next life. Tang, what's with you guys? I have no idea what you guys are talking about. There is a curse on Zhou’s soul, which has been with him for over 2000 years. The curse is that in Zhou's every life, he will always die when he's 26, and leave me alone. I'll live for a long, long, long time. Till my body perishes. After reincarnation, we carry on last life's memories, and meet again. This loop never ends. This life, you're leaving before me again. Is there any way to resolve it? I've tried many methods and failed. I can only prolong my life by borrowing others' lives, till I find a way to lift the curse. But to meet someone who matches the chances are slim. Su Yu's soul happens to match exactly. Tang, it's okay. I'll find a way to lift the curse with you. Eat. You eat, I don’t feel like eating now. Hello, who is this? Jun Chi? Don't you remember me? You are? I'm Yun Xi. I'm back, can we meet? Morning. Morning. Tang's still sleeping? Yeah, he was pretty tired last night. Let him sleep a little longer. How was it last night? What? You know. You… What's on your mind all day? In the future, stop watching those garbage shows, BL novels and comics ok? By the way, Yun Xi's back. Yun Xi, she called? Ya. Waiting for someone? Who are you waiting for? What about Su Yu? No clue right now. I think you don't want to get involved. Fine, I'll get involved. I'm borrowing Su's life for sure. You can mind your own business. Shao Tang. Welcome. Jun Chi, long time no see. It's been so long. How are you? What have you been up to lately? What would you like to order? Two Chivas. I don’t drink, give me orange juice. Long time no see, your taste has changed. How are you? Did you come back alone? Where's Yun Luo? I came back by myself. Yun Luo's studying over there. Their majors have more work. Oh, right. I heard that after you went abroad, you had some serious illness. Have you recovered? Yes. Thankfully. Cardina's medical service is better than over here, so I've recovered. That's great. Did you have a new girlfriend? Could we get the bill first? We're closing. How much? I'll get it. Mr. Zhou, today's our store anniversary. The price of all drinks has increased to 5000 yuan each. Credit card or cash? Is there some kind of mistake? Shao Tang, what are you doing? I'll give you a 50% discount. Two drinks, 5000, credit card. Jun Chi, this… It's ok. You know each other? Yeah, he's Shao Tang, the owner of this bar. We've known each other for a long time. Oh, oh yeah. You haven't answered my question. Do you have a girlfriend now? I… Mr. Zhou, here, enjoy. Yun Xi, I'll take you home. It's ok, Jun Chi. I'll take a cab. Let Zhou take you. It's not safe for you to go home alone at night. I'm staying at Jiaming Hotel. Come with me, I'll take you. Zhou Jun Chi, thank you. Lend me 10 yuan. I'll take a cab. Let's go together. I won't disturb you two. I want to go home. It's so cold out. Give me the money. Oh my. What a friend. He just left like that. Tisk tisk. Tang, you're back, where's my brother? Your brother went out with his ex. What? Oops. Here comes a strong opponent. She's trying to break up the perfect pair. I will no longer tolerate. What are you talking about? You're so big hearted, I really admire it. Facing such a strong enemy, we should fight side by side. No, I'm calling my brother. Tell him to hurry home. Jun Chi, can't we be like before? Yun Xi, let go of me. No, I'm afraid if I do, you'll disappear. Stay with me. Yun Xi, you drank too much, you should rest. Zhou Jun Chi, you're so mean. Have you forgotten our past? I didn't. Or do you have someone else now? Yes, I do. Are you satisfied? I really have to go. No, I came forward already. Stay with me for one night, okay? Hey, when are you coming back? Tang has prepared everything for you. You better come back tonight. Shao Tang? You two seem close. I'm going back. Jun Chi, Jun Chi. Shao Tang. What are you two looking at? Come here. What? You smell like her perfume. I can't let her break up the couple. I'll be more lenient if you confess. Tell me, what did you do with Yun Xi? Nothing. Zhao Ting Ting, did you fail this semester? And had a relationship with a gangster? And owe me money? You set dad's study on fire, right? Tang… I'm going back to my room to study. Study makes me happy, makes me better. I'll go back to study more. Zhou. Shao Tang, listen to me. Save it, I understand. Men having needs... is normal. Sometime they don't filter. Nothing happened between Yun Xi and I. Doesn't matter if anything happened. That's your business, right? I just took her back to the hotel, then… I don't want the details. I don't need to know what happened. Hey. Miss Yun. My girlfriend has livor mortis, what do I do? I don't know. Don't say that. What should I do now? How would I know? Miss Yun, don't say you don't know. We had an agreement. What agreement? You're just my experimental subjects. You can't negotiate with me. Jun Chi, save me. Yun Xi. Yun Xi. Something happened to her. Jun Chi, I'm scared. It's okay, it's okay, what's wrong? This place is haunted. I was in the shower, the ghost appeared. She opened her bloody mouth and wanted my life. I wanted to open the door and run out. But the door wouldn't open. Okay, let's switch to another hotel. But the ghost now haunts me. I'm so scared. Zhou, you should be a gentleman. Yun Xi. Come home with us. It's not safe here. There's at least us at home. Come, Yun Xi, eat some fruit. Thank you. Jun Chi, do you really believe me? Yes. Honestly, if I didn't personally experience this, I wouldn't believe it. Jun Chi, what should I do? What's haunting you? I don't know. When I was in bed alone, and closed my eyes, I felt like I was being tied up by something, and that thing even talked to me. But when I open my eyes, I saw nothing. Jun Chi, what should I do? I'm scared. I'm scared to sleep alone. Yun Xi, use your mouth to eat, not talk. You're too skinny, eat more. How about I sleep in the living room tonight? Yun Xi and Zhou. Do you two want to catch up? No, Yun Xi should sleep with me. I want to hear about your past with my brother, too. How about I sleep in the living room? It's okay, Yun Xi will sleep with me. What if the monster comes to you at night? Don't worry, I look too scary for them. Is that ok? Of course, you're quite safe with me. OK then. What are you doing? Miss Yun. I hope you can solve the problem with my girlfriend's body. Otherwise. I know a lot about you. Don't bother me anymore. Or I'll have you disappear. From what you say, it seems you have troubles yourself. You… I don't care what method you use, you have to keep her alive. If she doesn't make it, you won’t have it easy, either. Yun Xi, what are you doing? I'm I'm thirsty, want to drink some water. Oh, there's water in my house. I want to go to the bathroom as well. Have you gone? Not yet, Ting Ting, why are you out? I want to go to the bathroom. Have you gone? Ya. Good, then my turn. Shao Tang. Do something for me. Once you're done, I'll put your girlfriend's soul into the next container. How do I believe you? Your call. Deal. Yun Xi. Hey. Ting Ting, good morning. Go tell them breakfast's ready. Come eat. You're so kind. They can sleep for very long. They wake up really late every day. I end up hungry all the time. I'll go get them. Time to eat. Zhou, look how good Yun Xi is. You have no idea how lucky you are. If it were me, I would have married her a long time ago. So much talk in the morning. Zhou. This is your fault. Follow me. What? Ah. Ah. Today, I don't need any food... except for your PDAs. Jun Chi, can you go to the hotel with me again? I forgot some stuff last night. Sure. Thank you. Let's eat breakfast. Yun Xi, let me tell you. Zhou's like that. You were in a relationship with him before. He acts all cold. But deep inside he's a good man. He's a poor second generation. And you used to study abroad. You two are a perfect match. I think. Jun Chi likes someone else now, right? No way. I'm with him every day. I'm telling you, he hasn’t had sex life in years. Shao Tang. I still have an IOU from you. I advise you not to talk too much. See, he won't let me continue. Zhou, stop the car, I saw Zhang Yang. You sure? Are you really sure? He's not too keen on details. He's probably wrong. Let's go. I'm sure of what I saw. You always frustrate me. I do not. You do. I don't have time for this. I'm going after Zhang Yang. You're going after him like that? You take Yun Xi back to the hotel first. I'll drive after Zhang Yang. Yun Xi, what are you taking? Yun Xi. It's late. Why aren't you back yet? Tang, Tang. Tang. Prosperity, democracy, patriotism, peace and friendliness. Patriotic and dedicated. Bless me, bless me. Amitabha, Amitabha. Tang, wake up. Tang, Tang. Bless me, Amitabha. Tang, wake up, Tang. Tang, Tang, wake up. Ting Ting. You're caught, too? You're up. I knew you were up to something. What do you want? Shao Tang, what's so good about you? That deserves Zhou Jun Chi's love? And you, Zhao Ting Ting. You're his half sister. I treat him so well, but he doesn't repay me. Why? I've given so much, but can't get what I want. And you... have it so easily. It's not fair. Just say what you want. Don't beat around the bush. I want your body. I want to be you. Being someone else. You're always a substitute. Even if you have everything, none of it is yours. Besides, you think you have it the worst? Maybe sometimes the person you want to be have more unknown pain. Are you happy to be your sister? Looking at everything she once had, are you more jealous and resentful? You've seen through me long ago, Shao Tang. I'll become you. This way, I can be with Jun Chi every day. Drink it, and it will devour your soul. Then your body will be mine. Don't hurt him, fight me. Picking a fight with some bottom your size? How lame. Come at me instead. Shut up. Tang, Tang, wake up. Tang Tang. Tang, wake up, Tang. Tang, wake up, Tang. Tang. Wake up, Tang. Jun Chi, do you love me? Talk to me, Jun Chi, look at me. Do you remember Yun Xi, who loved you deeply? Jun Chi, let's start over, okay? Yun Luo, stop pretending. Jun Chi, what are you talking about? I don't understand. Miss Yun, it's time to fulfill your promise. What promise? I don't seem to know you. Get out of my sight. Yun Luo, Yun Xi is your sister. Isn't it good to be yourself? Zhou Jun Chi, you're quite smart. See through me so soon. You have too many flaws. Zhou Jun Chi, look at me, look at my face. Exactly the same as my sister's. Why can’t you treat me like the way you treat her? Your biggest flaw is misunderstanding my relationship with her. We're close friends, not lovers. You said you've never read Ting Ting's comic. That kind of comics were recommended by your sister. You think you have become Yun Xi, but you don’t know Yun Xi at all. You killed your sister, right? You know everything. Yes, I killed her. She has always been the little princess at home. The favorite among relatives and friends. We look exactly the same, but no one notices me. I've always been her accessory. I've had it enough. I want everything she has, including you. You're just a walking dead now. Is it worth it? Yun Luo, let Shao Tang and Ting Ting go. Too late, you'll never see Shao Tang again. I fed him the meds. Now his soul is being devoured bit by bit. I will have his body soon. You're not Shao Tang. You'll never get what you want. Zhou Jun Chi, stop talking. Even if I can't get what I want, I won't let Shao Tang get it. You don't deserve all the blessing when I'm miserable, it's not fair. You think Shao Tang is doing well? He's a psychic, he'll live a long, long life. He won't die. He's not happy. Because while he has unlimited life, he doesn't have the most precious thing: time. I don't care, I want Shao Tang dead. Yun Luo, I don't care if you're a man or woman, monster or ghost. If you dare to hurt Shao Tang and Ting Ting. I'll never let you go. Where did you hide Shao Tang? He's trapped in the barrier, dying. Ting Ting, how is it? How is it, Ting Ting? It's too thick to bite off. Zhang Yang, you traitor. You broke the contract first. Su Yu's body has started to rot. You've screwed us over. Without me, Mei Lu would still die. She has terminal illness, she deserves to die. Then you deserve to die, too. You occupy your sister's body. You're just a walking dead. Look at the spots on your face, the body's already rejecting you. What? Tang, what should I do? This should be a barrier, we're trapped in the barrier. Then how do we get out? Don't worry, I can solve it. I'll get you out. Shao Tang. How did you get out of the barrier? Yun Xi, you've underestimate me and Zhou. Do you think we're ordinary people? You're wrong. Do you know what Zhou and I are? We're psychics. Your meds are useless on me. None of you can get away. Zhou. We can't avoid fate. Shao Tang, see you in the next life. How could this be? How could this be? Why is this happening? (One month later) Be sensible will you? I need to clean the floor, get up. It hurts. I kicked very lightly. But my feet felt the vibes, and sent it to my back and heart. You… I'm wounded now. Don't forget who I was injured for. Pour me some water. Fine, have it your way. Please have some water, Master. Work hard and you'll get rewarded. I quit, I'm going to work. You're not allowed. I still need to support my family. Let me go. No. I don't care, I'm quitting. Ah, it hurts, it hurts. Keep pretending. I'm not pretending, I'm not. Zhou. What are you doing? Two men alone in a room. What else can I do? You're playing with fire. Liar. When you have bad thoughts of me, it doesn't hurt, right? I'm going to work now. I should give them a push. Ting Ting. Tang. My brother was taken by a group of strangers. What strangers? I don't know, they said they want to see you. If you don't show, they'll kill him. Go take a look. OK, I'm coming. Zhou. Shao Tang, are you okay? How are you? Are you okay? Are you injured? Zhao Ting Ting. How did it go? Garbage.
