I'M GONNA SHOW 'EM ONE OF UNCLE SAM'S. WAS THAT MOUSE IN THERE? [ SQUEAKING ] [ JOHNNY: ] CHILDREN, THIS IS A MINUTEMAN THREE. THAT CONCRETE SLAB YOU SEE ROLLING OFF WEIGHS 40 TONS. WHEN THE MISSILE IS ACTUALLY LAUNCHED, THEY BLOW IT OFF WITH EXPLOSIVES. THIS PARTICULAR MISSILE, OR BIRD AS IT'S CALLED, IS 66 FEET LONG. IT HAS A RANGE OF 7,000 MILES. AND A 20 MEGATON WARHEAD. WHICH IS MORE THAN ALL THE EXPLOSIVES DROPPED BY BOTH SIDES IN WORLD WAR II. IT USES SOLID ROCKET FUEL. AND CAN BE OUT OF HERE IN 32 SECONDS. [ JOHNNY: ] WE ARE NOW 50 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE. LET THE GENTLEMEN THROUGH. THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO MEN IN THIS ROOM. BEHIND THESE DOORS ARE THE CONTROLS THAT LAUNCH THE MISSILE YOU JUST SAW. [ GIRL: ] WHERE IS IT AIMED? THAT'S CLASSIFIED, HONEY. BUT IT CAN BE ANYWHERE IN RUSSIA IN 20 MINUTES. STAND CLEAR! BACK UP. LET THEM GET IN HERE. SIR? YES, CHUCK? WHY ARE THEY CARRYING GUNS? IT'S THE MILITARY, SON. DOWN HERE NOTHING IS LEFT TO CHANCE. EVEN OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS HAVE BACK-UP SYSTEMS. [ CHUCK: ] WHO COULD GET TO THEM IN THERE? NO ONE. LOOK, THIS IS THE CORNERSTONE OF AMERICA'S DEFENSE. AND IT IS THE MOST CAREFULLY DESIGNED SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. THESE MEN ARE THE LAST LINK IN A HUGE CHAIN THAT STARTS AND CAN ONLY START WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TO SHOOT EACH OTHER? WHO SAID THEY HAD TO SHOOT EACH OTHER? CHILDREN... SIMPLE TRUTH IS... THAT MISSILE WILL NEVER BE USED. THAT'S WHY IT WAS BUILT. AND THOSE GUNS ARE NEVER COMING OUT OF THOSE HOLSTERS. NOW YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT EVERYBODY, AND I MEAN EVERYBODY, DOWN HERE IS VERY, VERY CAREFUL. COLONEL? [ KIDS WHISPERING ] IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE? THE PLANE MY DAD FLIES... IN THE RESERVES. UM-HMM? HE HAS AIR TO GROUND MISSILES. LOTS OF STUFF. MAYBE EVEN NUKES SOMETIMES, RIGHT? SO? WELL... HE'S ALL ALONE UP THERE. WHAT IF HE FREAKS OUT? [ LAUGHING ] WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FREAKING OUT? CHUCK, LISTEN TO ME. IF YOUR DADDY EVER HAS NUKES, WHICH I DOUBT, THEY ARE TACTICAL. HMMM? I MEAN, DAMN FOOT SOLDIERS CAN HAVE TACTICAL NUKES IN THEIR BAZOOKAS. THAT'S A TOY COMPARED TO WHAT YOU SAW TODAY. WHAT? YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO EXPLAIN. LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO JOIN YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS. NO. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW MY DAD'S PLANE IS A TOY. LOOK... FOR A BRIGHT KID, YOU ARE A TAD SLOW. DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAW TODAY? ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE IF I CAN... LET'S SAY...LET'S JUST SAY THAT YOUR MAMA AND YOUR SISTER ARE WASHING DISHES AFTER DINNER. AND CAROLINE DROPS A FORK. NOW IF AN ICBM AIR BURSTS EVEN MILES AWAY... YOUR SISTER'S GONNA BE VAPORIZED BEFORE THAT FORK HITS THE FLOOR. NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH, VAPORIZED. SO IS EVERYBODY ELSE IN A 50 MILE RADIUS. NOW, LET'S JUST... LET'S SAY FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT YOUR DADDY WORKS IN THIS HOLE, RIGHT BEHIND THIS DOOR. AND HE KNOWS ALL THAT AND HE GETS THE ORDER TO LAUNCH. AND HE SAYS, WHOA, NOW! WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE THIS ORDER'S A MISTAKE. BUT IF I TURN THAT KEY... THEY ALL GO. GLOBAL NUCLEAR EXCHANGE. NOW DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRUST HIM... TO TURN THAT KEY? WOULD YOU TRUST HIM? WELL, SON... I'M SORRY, BUT... THAT'S WHAT THE PISTOLS ARE FOR. JOHN GOODE LOVED YOUR LAUNCH TODAY, CHUCK. THOUGHT YOU MADE A GREAT ROCKET. WANTS TO SEE IT NEXT TIME WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THE MOUSE. GOOD FOR JOHN B. SO IMPRESSED HE HAD TO SHOW THEM HIS WAS BIGGER. [ CAROLINE: ] CHUCK LET THE MOUSE GO. IN THE YARD. HE'S GONE. [ MOANING ] LET'S JUST SAY THAT YOUR MAMA AND YOUR SISTER ARE WASHING DISHES AFTER DINNER. AND CAROLINE DROPS A FORK. [ SIRENS ] [ INDISTINCT VOICE ] THEY ALL GO. GLOBAL NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.

I CAN'T PLAY BECAUSE THERE'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH BASEBALL? NOTHING. BUT IT'S MY BEST THING. I HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING. WHO TOLD YOU THAT? NOBODY. [ KIDS: ] LET'S GET MOVIN'! DOES YOUR DAD KNOW ABOUT THIS? MM MM. YOU'RE NOT KIDDIN'. I KNOW YOU ALL YOUR LIFE. NEVER EVEN KNOWN YOU TO TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF. I KNOW. WHAT STUFF? NUCLEAR WEAPONS, RUSS.

AREN'T YOU SCARED JUST KNOWING THEY'RE THERE? WHEN I LET MYSELF THINK ABOUT IT. I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. BEFORE THE GAME, YOU SAID... SOMETHING ABOUT US BEING OLD FARTS TOGETHER SOMEWHERE. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND UNCLE DICK HAD THAT FIGHT ON THE PORCH AT THE CABIN? YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE OLD FARTS, FISHING SOMEPLACE, OR SOMETHING. HE SAID YOU'D LOSE A LOT OF MONEY. AND NOBODY CARED ANYWAY. YOU BOTH NEED THE MONEY. THEN YOU SAID YOU CARED. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU CALLED PRINCIPLES. YOU HEARD ALL THAT? YEAH. IS THAT WHAT I HEARD WITH YOU AND UNCLE DICK? PRINCIPLES? BACK THEN I JUST GAVE UP SOME MONEY, THAT'S ALL. YOU'RE GIVING UP BASEBALL. DAD, WHAT'S YOUR BEST THING? YOU COULDN'T GIVE UP MOM AND CAROLINE. I DON'T KNOW. FLYING A PLANE, I GUESS. CHUCK, WHEN UNCLE DICK AND I WERE FIGHTING, DID YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THE PRINCIPLES WERE ABOUT? NO. COME ON. LET'S WALK. [ INDISTINCT ANNOUNCER ] LOOKING FOR THE PICK. GOT THE PICK... GOIN' TO THE RIGHT. AMAZING GRACE GETS BACK ON DEFENSE, AND LEE JACKSON JUMPS. THEY'RE BACK THE OTHER WAY. THEY'VE PICKED THE BALL UP.

IF HIS KNEES HOLD OUT, I'LL MAKE HIM A MILLIONAIRE. IS THAT THE KID FROM KENTUCKY? INDIANA. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ SIRENS OUTSIDE ] LOOK AT THIS. SOME KID FROM MONTANA... LITTLE LEAGUE PITCHER. I HAVE SOME CHECKS. I WONDER IF A KID REALLY DID THIS. ALL THAT FOR CHARTERING ONE LITTLE JET? ALL THAT FOR ONE JUVENILE WHIM. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU PUT THE LITTLE BALL THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOP, I'LL MANAGE YOUR MONEY. DO THAT AGAIN. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD READ THIS. SOUNDS LIKE AN INTERESTING KID. AMAZING? SOME KIDS EAT GOLDFISH. [ KIDS TALKING ] [ BOY: ] WHAT A WIMP! HEY, CHUCK! THE SKY IS FALLING! [ KIDS LAUGHING ] [ AMAZING: ] YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE BASKET, AND PLAY DEFENSE. [ CAROLINE: ] LIKE THIS? MR. AMAZING, CHUCK'S HERE. HI. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BOUNCE IT! MR. SMITH READ ABOUT YOU IN THE PAPER, CHUCK. HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME. HE HAS A GAME TOMORROW IN SEATTLE. CAROLINE, COME INSIDE NOW. MR. SMITH'S COME A LONG WAY TO SEE YOUR BROTHER. PAPER SAID THAT YOU WERE THE STAR PLAYER. THAT TRUE? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE. THESE GO IN THERE? YEAH. IT'S CLOSE. YOU WANNA SHOW ME HOW THIS IS DONE? I CAN'T. SO YOU WON'T EVEN DO THIS ANYMORE, HUH? THAT'S OKAY. YOU'RE PROBABLY A GUY THAT NEVER MISSES ANYWAY. FRIENDS THINK YOU LET 'EM DOWN? WE WOULD'VE GONE TO STATE FINALS. THEY'RE ANGRY AT ME. THEY THINK I'M SELFISH. ALL OF 'EM? NOT ALL OF 'EM. BUT MOST OF 'EM. YOU KNOW... I WISH I NEVER WOULD HAVE STARTED ANY OF THIS. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. IT'S DUMB. WELL, YOU GOT ME HERE. WHY ARE YOU HERE? I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD OF HIM. YEAH, WE ARE. IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, MR. SMITH. THANK YOU. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO LIVINGSTON? YOUR SON. YOU LOST ME. I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. I'M GONNA DO WHAT CHUCK DID. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M GONNA RESIGN. AND I'D LIKE TO NAME CHUCK WHEN I DO. ARE YOU ASKING ME IF YOU CAN USE HIS NAME? WHY? WELL, IT WAS HIS IDEA. WHAT'S HIS IDEA? WHATEVER THIS TURNS OUT TO BE. THERE'S THIS 12 YEAR OLD KID IN MONTANA. HIS NAME IS CHUCK MURDOCK. HE MADE THE PAPERS A FEW WEEKS BACK, WHEN HE REFUSED TO PLAY BASEBALL BECAUSE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE GAVE UP WHAT HE DID BEST BECAUSE OF THIS IDEA. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. BUT HE'S REAL. I MET HIM. AND I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE ALONE. [ ALL TALKING ] YOU'RE TELLING US YOU'RE LEAVING BASKETBALL AS A PROTEST? I AM GIVING UP BASKETBALL, UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SO YOU JUST LEAVE AND I'M SUPPOSED TO CLEAN IT UP? YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF THE TEAM DOESN'T SUE YOU! AND THE ENDORSEMENTS. THE JUICE, THE SHOES... THOSE GUYS BOUGHT AN IMAGE! SOME IMAGE! YOU WANT ME TO SAY SOMETHING? NO. I'M YOUR MANAGER! YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME. WHO DO YOU THINK CARES ANYWAY? IF SOME GUY WITH A PITUITARY PROBLEM STOPS RUNNING UP AND DOWN IN HIS UNDERWEAR? MAYBE ONLY YOU. YOU WERE MY FIRST CLIENT. RIGHT OUT OF BUSINESS SCHOOL. YOU WERE A PISTOL, EVEN THEN. I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS. IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM. OH. JUST LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN MOURNING OVER THEM FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS TOO? WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK? PROBABLY WHEN IT'S OVER. IN ONE OF THE WEIRDER NUCLEAR PROTESTS THAT I CAN REMEMBER, AMAZING GRACE SMITH RESIGNED FROM THE BOSTON CELTICS THIS AFTERNOON. WITH SMITH HAVING ABANDONED THE TEAM, CELTIC TITLE HOPES SUDDENLY ARE DOWN. MANY OBSERVERS, INCLUDING THIS REPORTER... THE CHINESE TRANSACTION. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THE SOUTH AFRICANS WISH US TO GO PUBLIC? ...CLAIMED TO BE IMITATING THE ACTIONS OF A 12 YEAR OLD MONTANA LITTLE LEAGUE PITCHER. THE BOY, CHUCK MURDOCK, APPARENTLY CITED THE EXISTENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS THE REASON HE'S REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN BASEBALL. UNTIL THIS MOMENT, SMITH, WHO'S BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR NINE YEARS, WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST STABLE AND CONSISTENT PLAYERS IN THE NBA. ONE THING I ADMIRE ABOUT SPORTS IN YOUR COUNTRY... IS THE COLORFUL PERSONALITIES OF YOUR SPORTSMEN. WE LET THEM THINK AS WELL AS PLAY, JOHANNE. YES. PERHAPS OURS ARE AFRAID OF MAKING FOOLS OF THEMSELVES. YOUR MR. SMITH APPEARS TO BE FEARLESS. HAS HE MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF? [ CHUCKLING ] HAS HE REALLY? I'M NOT SO SURE. WE'RE A SENTIMENTAL NATION. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THIS MAN IS DANGEROUS? IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO HEARS HIM. [ MAN: ] MR. SMITH? I'M JOHN POLLOCK FROM THE LOCAL PAPER. APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU. MR. POLLOCK, MEET CHUCK MURDOCK. PROBABLY ALREADY MET HIM. UH, NO. HELLO, SON. UM...MIND IF I SIT? I, UH...WROTE THAT STORY ON YOU. WHEN YOU DIDN'T PITCH. REAL EVENT TO HAVE YOU VISIT US THIS WAY. YOU GOING TO ORGANIZE IT FROM HERE? ORGANIZE WHAT? OH, EXCUSE ME. I ASSUMED THIS WAS A MOVEMENT OF SOME KIND. OR DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONAL ABSENCE WILL CHANGE NUCLEAR POLICY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MEAN UH... YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE SOME KIND OF FIRST STEP? THEN LET THE RUSSIANS FOLLOW SUIT? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT YOU THINK? I THINK MY READERS MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK. REALLY? WHY? KID, THIS IS YOUR SHOW. YOU GOTTA TELL THIS GUY WHAT YOU THINK. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE MISSILES, SIR? WHY DO YOU WANT 'EM? [ HORN BLOWING ] YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR OWN DELIVERIES? SPECIAL CASE. HAVIN' FUN OUT HERE? IS THAT SO AWFUL? YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE ME, BUT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME CALLING YOU "AMAZING." YOU GOT A REAL NAME? MORRIS. CHUCK SAYS YOU'RE A FIGHTER PILOT. WAS. I'M IN THE RESERVES. SAYS YOU LOVE IT. LOVE TO FLY. MILLION A YEAR, HUH? LITTLE BIT MORE. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BUT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THERE WEREN'T? NICE? GIVE ME A HAND WITH THESE. LOOK, IF YOU'RE SO BORED THAT YOU NEED SOME KIND OF CRUSADE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, YOU COULD AT LEAST LEAVE MY KID OUT OF IT. HE'S JUST A BOY. TRUE, BUT HE STARTED IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU'RE THE DAMNED PIED PIPER? LOOK... I HEARD THE MUSIC PLAYING. I THOUGHT IT WAS COMING FROM YOUR PLACE. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THAT PLACE. I'M GLAD IT'S GOING TO BE USED AGAIN. USED? PRETENDING TO LIVE IN A RUINED BARN? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FULL OF IT. WHY, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE GUY'S SINCERE? 'CAUSE I DOUBT HIS STABILITY? HIS STABILITY? BECAUSE HE WALKED AWAY FROM MONEY? A CAREER? YOU DON'T DOUBT HIM. YOU DON'T LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE'S... INCONVENIENT. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT. [ ENGINE AND SIRENS ] [ MEN: ] COME ON, LET'S GO! GET HIM IN HERE! HURRY UP! PUT ME DOWN!

THAT'S MY QUARTERBACK, GEORGE MASTEN. HOW YOU DOIN', KID? THAT'S RIGHT, THE CORE OF THE DOLPHIN AIR ATTACK. [ MEN LAUGHING ] I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WOULD'VE WON THE SUPER BOWL LAST YEAR. WE WOULD'VE IF GEORGE COULD HAVE GOT THE BALLS. GEORGE! GEORGE! IF HOT DOG HERE WOULD'VE BROUGHT HIS PLAYBOOK INSTEAD OF HIS PHONE BOOK... THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT TOO. SO IS THE PRESSURE GETTIN' HEAVY UP HERE? IT'LL GET WORSE. [ GEORGE: ] SO... YOU DON'T PLAY BASEBALL NO MORE, IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. WHY NOT? I READ ABOUT IT BUT... IT WAS REALLY NOT CLEAR TO ME. DID YOU SEE SOME UH... PROPAGANDA MOVIE OR SOMETHING? [ MEN LAUGHING ] NO. FRIEND OF MY DAD'S... SHOWED MY CLASS A MINUTEMAN THREE. UH HUH. HOW GOOD WAS THIS KID? HE WAS THE BEST. WHOLE CAREER NIPPED IN THE BUD, JUST LIKE THAT? HEY, IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE. [ LAUGHING ] YEAH, RIGHT. [ HOT DOG: ] WE THOUGHT YOU FLIPPED OUT.

I FLEW BACK A LO WAYS, JUST TO SEE YOU. IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING I'VE HEARD. I WON'T TELL YOU WHERE AND I WON'T TELL YOU WHO. YOU HAVE A CLIENT NAMED AMAZING GRACE SMITH. THERE ARE PEOPLE, SOME I'M SORRY TO SAY, EVEN FRIENDS OF MINE. THESE PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PREDICTING EVENTS. THEY ENJOY PREDICTABILITY. IN FACT, THEY REQUIRE IT. YOU EVER PLAY POKER? POPULAR MOVEMENTS ARE LIKE WILD CARDS. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHEN ANY OF THESE VERY POWERFUL PLAYERS COULD PROVE DANGEROUS TO YOUR MR. SMITH. BUT THEN, IT WOULD TAKE ONLY ONE. THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU. OF COURSE, THE MORE INFORMATION YOU CAN GIVE ME... THE MORE PERSUASIVE I CAN BE WITH MY CLIENT. I HOPE I HAVEN'T SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY. BY THE TIME I LEFT THE TOUR IN JAPAN, WE WERE UP TO 212 ATHLETES FROM EUROPE AND JAPAN ALONE. THE INTERESTING THING IS THE RECENT ADDITION OF SOVIET BLOCK ATHLETES. PARTICULARLY THE EAST GERMANS, THE CZECHS, THE YUGOSLAVS... BECAUSE UP TO THIS POINT, ONLY FREE WORLD ATHLETES HAD RESPONDED. NONE OF US KNEW IF THIS IDEA COULD CROSS THE IRON CURTAIN. WELL, IT HAS. [ ALL TALKING ] [ HOT DOG: ] IS THIS PARIS? AMAZING, YOU KNOW HOW TO SPEAK FRENCH? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHUCK: ] KISSIN' YOUR SISTER? [ RUSS: ] YEAH, YOU KNOW. LIKE A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN. WHICH'D BE BETTER? KISSIN' CAROLINE OR... STRIKIN' OUT THAT MUTANT MONSTER FROM GREAT FALLS LAST YEAR. EASY. CAROLINE. GOD, YOU'RE A WEIRD KID. SO WHAT? PRETTY SCARED? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WANTED TO TALK TO ME. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? DO WHAT'S RIGHT. THE WAY YOU SEE IT. NO, I MEAN ABOUT YOU. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME TO STOP. YOU CAN SAY IT. IF I WANTED YOU TO STOP, I'D STOP YOU MYSELF. I WISH AMAZING COULD BE THERE WITH ME. YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. HE'S RUNNING A LITTLE LATE. MAYBE AFTER YOU MEET THE PRESIDENT, YOU'D LIKE A RIDE ON A COBRA. OR WE COULD FLY YOU OVER TO ANNAPOLIS, AND YOU COULD GO ON A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE. THIS BOY DOESN'T WANT TO GO ON A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE. HE WANTS TO PLAY BASEBALL. HELLO, CHUCK. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT ON OUR OWN, DOW. WISH I COULD SAY I WAS MORE LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE BUT... I DIDN'T HAVE YOUR GRIT. THANK YOU, SIR. YOU KNOW THIS JOB OF MINE CAN GET A LITTLE BIT LONELY. I FIGURE YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LONELINESS. REFUSING TO PLAY BASEBALL. TO FIGHT FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN, I READ THAT. AND I THOUGHT, THERE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO'S WILLING TO RISK LONELINESS. BEING CUT OFF FROM HIS FRIENDS. ISOLATION. I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT, SIR. BUT YOU FEEL IT, DON'T YOU? SOMETIMES. SIT DOWN, CHUCK. YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT... THERE WAS A RIOT AT A SOCCER GAME. IN GERMANY. SOME PEOPLE BLAME THAT ON YOU. EVEN SOME OF MY AIDES. THIS GUY WHO WAS TRYING TO FEED YOU ICE CREAM. THEY RAN UP A LITTLE DISPLAY BOARD FOR YOU, LOTS OF BLINKING LIGHTS. WHITE LIGHTS FOR THE AMERICAN MISSILES, YOU KNOW, WHITE FOR THE GOOD GUYS. AND THE SOVIET MISSILES, OF COURSE, WERE LITTLE RED LIGHTS. I THINK THEY WANTED YOU TO SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT MORE RED LIGHTS THAN WHITE ONES. THEY WANT ME TO TELL YOU YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING OUR COUNTRY, BY NOT PLAYING LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. NOW THEY'RE HONEST MEN. THEY BELIEVE THAT STUFF. I THINK IT'S NONSENSE. DON'T YOU? YES, SIR. I GUESS I DO. OF COURSE... I'M A SPORTS FAN AND THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, NEXT SEASON LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL WASHOUT. BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO TELL AN HONEST PERSON TO STOP DOING WHAT HE FEELS IN HIS HEART IS RIGHT. THAT'S THE TOUGHEST THING IN THE WORLD TO ASK A MAN TO DO. AND I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU. SIR, WHY? I'M IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET PREMIER ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE, THE OTHER GUY IS ALWAYS JUDGING YOUR STRENGTH. THEY THINK I'M STRONG ONLY IF THEY THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION ARE GONNA BACK ME UP. I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU YOU'RE DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY. BUT I AM TELLING YOU THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT HARDER FOR ME TO GET RID OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. NOW, YOU STOOD UP FOR YOUR BELIEFS. THAT FEELS GOOD. AND IT'S RIGHT. BUT THIS WORK WE'RE DOING, THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THEY'RE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE FEELINGS. SO I AM GONNA ASK YOU... TO GET OUT THERE AND START STRIKING OUT HITTERS AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU SAY? SIR, I CAN'T. I GUESS YOU MEAN YOU WON'T. YES, SIR. I GUESS I DO. WELL, IT'S A TOUGH CALL. WE'RE PRETTY PARTIAL TO THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH IN THIS REPUBLIC. MAY GOD NEVER SEE THAT CHANGE. BUT THERE'S A SAYING, CHUCK, THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOESN'T GIVE ANYBODY THE RIGHT TO RUSH INTO A CROWDED THEATRE AND YELL "FIRE." BUT, SIR... WHAT IF THERE IS A FIRE? [ CHUCK: ] WHO'S RIGHT? [ AMAZING: ] YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT. IT'S EASY BEIN' RIGHT. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? DOIN' RIGHT. THAT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER. YOU SEE, THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS POINT OF VIEW, AND YOU HAVE YOURS. YOU'RE BOTH TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE FROM WHERE YOU'RE STANDING. BUT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE WRONG. BUT THERE'S NO REAL WAY TO KNOW WHO IT IS. HOW DOES ANYBODY EVER KNOW WHAT TO DO? WELL, YOU JUST... FORGET ABOUT WHO'S STANDING WHERE. LOOKING AT WHAT AND JUST DO... WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE. ALREADY DONE? AWHILE AGO, YOU WENT UP TO YOUR COACH AND YOU QUIT BASEBALL. YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT BEING RIGHT, YOU WERE JUST DOING RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE THREE POINT SHOT? YOU MEAN ABOUT YOUR WIFE. NO, ABOUT HOW YOU MAKE ONE. AT THOSE MOMENTS, THERE'S NO NOISE, THERE'S NO CROWD, THERE'S NO OTHER PLAYER ON THE FLOOR. THERE'S JUST A BALL AND A HOOP, A LONG WAY AWAY. THAT ONE PERFECT THING. THAT'S IT, RIGHT. IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE SHOT BUT... I'M NOT THERE EITHER. I JUST DISAPPEAR. AND THAT'S HOW THINGS GET DONE. DISAPPEAR? YEAH. YOU TOO. JUST FORGET YOURSELF. IT WAS NEVER ME. AND IT WAS NEVER YOU. JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THE ACT. THIS REMINDS YOU OF YOUR ROOTS? WHERE WAS IT AGAIN? SOUTH UH...BRONX? PHILLY. CATCH. I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO COME OUT HERE. THIS GUY'S BEEN STALKING YOU. THROUGH ME. SIX WEDNESDAYS, AMAZING. GUYS LIKE THIS MAKE PRESIDENTS DISAPPEAR. HE USED SIX WEDNESDAYS, AMAZING. SO THAT YOU'D KNOW THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? I JUST WANT YOU TO COME BACK. COME BACK TO BOSTON! COME BACK TO THE TEAM. JUST COME BACK. OH, THANK YOU. MY PLEASURE. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN FORMALLY INTRODUCED. MY NAME IS ALEXANDER JEFFRIES. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE IN BOSTON. YOU HERE TO SEE THE CELTICS MANAGEMENT? NO, YOU. OH? WHATEVER ABOUT? GUYS YOU PLAY POKER WITH. [ SIGHING ] OH, YES. WELL... UNDERSTAND, MR. SMITH. THE GENTLEMEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, REGARD THE PUBLIC AS SIMPLY A GREAT BEAST. A BEAST THAT CAN ONLY BE SAFELY LED BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO HOLD THE LEASH. IF HE CAN'T CONTROL THEM, THE LEADER BECOMES MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE BEAST ITSELF. BEAST? YEAH, I'VE SEEN THAT. PLAYERS TRYING TO BREAK YOUR LEG, CROWD SCREAMING FOR BLOOD. A FAN HIT ME WITH A ROCK IN A PARKING LOT ONE NIGHT. JUST BECAUSE HIS TEAM LOST. AND YOUR POINT? I DON'T TRUST ME. I DON'T TRUST YOU. I DON'T TRUST ANYONE WITH HIS FINGER ON THAT TRIGGER. LACK OF CONFIDENCE... INDICATES A WANT OF LEADERSHIP, MR. SMITH. DROP THE LEASH. DON'T START SOMETHING YOU CAN'T FINISH. HERE'S A MESSAGE FROM THE BEAST. YOU MESS WITH MY FRIENDS AND I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! HAVE A GOOD TIME IN BOSTON WITH MISS TAYLOR? NO, SHE WASN'T THERE. SHE'S IN SAN FRANCISCO. GOTTA FLY OUT THERE TOMORROW NIGHT. SPEAK AT SOME LUNCHEON. LYNN'S PET CHARITY. GOT ANY JOKES I COULD TELL? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU HAVING A BAD DAY? YOU TOO SAD TO EAT? MEANS I GET YOUR LUNCH. HEY! THAT'S A BAD MOVE THERE. MAD DOG'S TURN TO COOK. OHHH! [ LAUGHING ] [ JET ENGINE ] [ PHONE RINGING ] HELLO. [ AMAZING: ] DID I WAKE YOU? YES. WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M STILL TRYING TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL. THESE GUYS WANT MORE MONEY OUT OF YOU THAN YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THAT IS, IF YOU'RE WORKING. I GUESS THIS JET CAME OUT OF YOUR POCKET. THANKS. JET? YEAH. YOU ORDERED A CESSNA. I BEGGED FOR A JET. AND YOU SAID I COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SO? SO THANKS FOR CHANGING YOUR MIND. I DIDN'T SEND A JET. YOU'RE ON A PLANE I DIDN'T SEND. OH GOD. LYNN, LISTEN TO ME. IT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU THINK. I'M GONNA HANG UP, AND GO GET THE PILOT TO LAND IMMEDIATELY. AMAZING... SHHHH. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME... YOU GO TO LIVINGSTON. AND NO MATTER WHAT, I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE. [ EXPLOSION ] WHO IS THIS? WHEN? OH, GEEZ. YES. RIGHT. THAT WAS JOHN POLLACK FROM THE ENTERPRISE. HE SAID AMAZING'S PLANE WENT DOWN IN THE ROCKIES. OH, MY GOD. THEY THINK IT HIT A MOUNTAIN. HE SAID THEY WOULD KNOW MORE IN THE MORNING. THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONNA BE OUTSIDE TOMORROW. THEY'RE GONNA CALL ALL NIGHT. I CAN'T TELL HIM TONIGHT. DAD. IT'S A HUMMINGBIRD FEEDER. OKAY. [ YAWNING ] YOUR MOM LOVES HUMMINGBIRDS. ISN'T IT A LITTLE EARLY IN THE MORNING? I DECIDED TO GET YOUR SISTER THAT PONY SHE WANTS. [ CRYING ] I LOVE YOU, CHUCK. AND I'M SORRY. WHAT'S THE MATTER? "VERY WELL," SAID THE LITTLE PIG. "WHAT TIME WILL YOU COME?" [ VOICES OUTSIDE ] "AT SIX O'CLOCK", SAID THE WOLF. THE LITTLE PIG GOT UP AT FIVE, AND HE WENT TO MR. SMITH'S FARM AND GOT THE TURNIPS BEFORE THE WOLF CAME TO HIS HOUSE. "LITTLE PIG, ARE YOU READY?" "READY? I'VE BEEN READY FOR YOU TO COME BACK." THE WOLF WAS VERY ANGRY BUT HE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER WAY... ALL THE PRESS PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE, CHUCK. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA GO TALK TO THEM. [ CAROLINE: ] ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH, CHUCK? [ CAMERAS CLICKING ] I HAD A FRIEND. HIS NAME WAS AMAZING GRACE SMITH. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. I THINK HE WAS THE BEST BASKETBALL PLAYER THAT EVER LIVED. ALL HE WANTED WAS FOR PEOPLE... TO LIVE. NOW HE'S GONE. HE TOLD ME, AND I'VE SEEN IT, THAT THERE'S DEATH BURIED IN THE EARTH. ENOUGH TO KILL US MANY TIMES. AMAZING SAID, IT'D BE A GOOD THING IF EVERYBODY STOPPED PRETENDING DEATH WASN'T THERE. IF WE STOPPED PLAYING, HE SAID WE COULD PLAY WHEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY. AND NOW HE'S GONE. AND THE DEATH IS STILL THERE. ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE UP NOW? I DON'T WANT TO TALK ANYMORE. [ REPORTERS: ] CHUCK? CAN YOU ANSWER... WHAT IS THAT? [ MAN: ] THAT'S AMAZING GRACE'S SIGN. CHUCK, HOW LONG YOU GONNA KEEP THIS UP? MR. MURDOCK, YOU GONNA PUT HIM BACK IN SCHOOL? [ SIGHING ] I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I ASKED YOU A QUESTION! SIT DOWN! NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION, OR YOU'RE GOING TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. [ CRUMPLING PAPER ] YOU DON'T WRITE THE ANSWER ON THE BLACKBOARD, YOU SPEAK WHEN I TELL YOU. ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE! I CHECKED THE EUROPEAN DESK THIS MORNING. THE FRENCH ARE LOOKING AT A WALK-OUT AT AN AUTO PLANT. THE ITALIANS, A WILDCAT STRIKE... GOOD NEWS IS THE EAST GERMANS HAVE PICKED IT UP. THAT IS GOOD NEWS? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT! I FAIL TO SEE HOW THAT IS. COULD BE A GENERAL STRIKE. DON'T BE SO NAIVE. MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE SOVIETS TO KEEP IT OUR PROBLEM. WE'VE SEEN DEMONSTRATIONS COME AND GO ON THE NUCLEAR ISSUE. THEY FLARE UP BUT THEY CAN'T SUSTAIN. THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT, THAT'S BEGINNING TO CONCERN ME, IS THIS SILENT CHILDREN THING. IT'S NEW. IT'S NOT NEW? IT'S NOT NEW. IT'S KIDS. IT'S HERE TODAY AND GONE TOMORROW. THE MEDIA DOESN'T EAT IT UP? NO. IT'S ON THE TABLE EVERY NIGHT AT DINNER. LET'S USE THAT. I SAY WE HAVE A NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING FOR SMITH. MAKE IT A SCHOOL HOLIDAY. BRING THE KIDS INTO IT. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? WE NEED THE PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THE NATION. TRY A HEARTFELT APPEAL. DIRECTLY TO THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD. I THINK WE NEED CHUCK MURDOCK ON THIS. I THINK WE SYMBOLICALLY DISMANTLE THE SILO HE VISITED. I THINK YOU GO THERE. IT'S YOUR SHOW. YOU GET THE KID ON T.V. WITH YOU. YOU TELL THE NATION THIS THING HAS REDOUBLED THE COMMITMENT OF THE ADULTS OF THE WORLD. TELL THE KID THE WORLD IS GRATEFUL. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF ALTERNATIVES, DOW. EVERYTHING BUT THE ONE THAT REALLY INTERESTS ME. [ VOICES AND SIRENS ] [ MAN: ] THIS WAY, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. GENERAL SECRETARY. [ RUSSIAN ] I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME SO QUICKLY, AND SO PRIVATELY. [ RUSSIAN ] I WOULD LIKE TO IMPOSE ONE THING FURTHER, IF I MAY ASK THE FAVOR THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVE US FULLY ALONE. [ RUSSIAN ] WELL, I'VE NEVER TRIED THIS BEFORE. HOW'S YOUR ENGLISH? WE ARE ABOUT TO DISCOVER. THIS IS NICE. WE SHOULD ALWAYS MEET LIKE THIS. BEFORE WE BEGIN... ARE ANY OF YOUR GRANDCHILDREN SPEAKING TO YOU? [ LAUGHING ] NYET, NYET. WELL, I'LL GO FIRST. THIS CHILDREN'S MOVEMENT IN MY COUNTRY, IS BECOMING A PROFOUND PROBLEM. IT'S JUST BEGUN, BUT IT CUTS DEEP. I CAN'T LET IT GO ON. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME MEASURE OF THE PROBLEM ALSO. FOR US, EVEN A SMALL PROBLEM OF THIS NATURE IS DISTURBING. OUR SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO COPE WITH CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE OF THIS KIND. LIKE YOUR PEOPLE, OURS ARE MOST SENTIMENTAL WHERE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED. SO I COME HERE WITH A QUESTION. IN THIS CRISIS... DO YOU AND I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY? HELLO, SIR. MR. MURDOCK. CHUCK. [ MAN: ] MR. PRESIDENT. HELLO AGAIN, CHUCK. MAJOR MURDOCK, I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU. IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, SIR. CHUCK... YOU ARE PRACTICALLY BACK ON THE PITCHER'S MOUND RIGHT NOW. MAJOR, THANK GOD YOUR BOY HAD THE GOOD SENSE NOT TO LISTEN TO ME BACK IN WASHINGTON. TONIGHT... WE'RE GOING ON THE TELEVISION AND READ THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT SAYS THAT THIS YEAR ALONE, OUR COUNTRY AND THE SOVIET UNION WILL EACH DISMANTLE 15 PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL STRATEGIC NUCLEAR CAPACITY. NOW TURN THE PAGE. IT'S A PROGRAM FOR SEVEN YEARS. AT THE END OF WHICH, OUR NUCLEAR ARSENALS WILL NO LONGER EXIST. CHUCK... NONE OF THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU AND MR. SMITH. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY HAVING YOU JOIN ME ON THE AIR. AND SAY A FEW WORDS. OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING. "I'M SORRY, SIR. I CAN'T." CHUCK, YOU CAN'T WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG? UH... SIR? I THINK WHAT CHUCK MIGHT BE FEELING... IS THAT AN AWFUL LOT CAN HAPPEN IN SEVEN YEARS. YOU'LL BE OUT OF OFFICE FOR ONE THING. SOVIET LEADERS CAN CHANGE ANYTIME. PEOPLE ARE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW. I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU GOT SO MUCH DONE. BUT WHEN THEY COOL OFF, THEY TEND TO FORGET. SOMETHING THIS HARD TO DO, SIR... MAYBE YOU HAVE TO STRIKE WHILE THE IRON'S HOT. IT SEEMS PRETTY HOT RIGHT ABOUT NOW. [ KIDS LAUGHING ] [ CRYING ] CHUCK... SINCE THIS WHOLE THING STARTED, THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN MEANING TO SAY TO YOU. I KIDDED MYSELF THAT I TOLD YOU A THOUSAND WAYS. BUT I NEVER SAID THE WORDS. AND NOW I NEED TO SAY THE WORDS. I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU. [ GEORGE: ] I HAD MY LAWYERS TRACE THROUGH THE PAPERWORK ON THAT HOLDING COMPANY. WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LINE, THAT'S THE MAN THAT OWNED THAT CHARTERED JET. I'M GONNA HIRE A GUY. THE GUYS THAT KILL SLOWLY. NO, DARLIN'. THAT'S NOT WHAT AMAZING DIED FOR. [ HOT DOG: ] WELL, LOOK... THIS GUY LIKES TO PLAY IN THE DARK. LET'S TURN ON SOME LIGHTS. [ VOICES TALKING ] [ PHONE RINGING ] PUT A TRADING STOCK LOSS ORDER OF SAY, FIVE PERCENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU COULD GET A HALF, THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS. WHAT ABOUT THE AMBASSADOR? WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS... NOW THE JOINT CHIEFS ARE TELLING US THEY CAN NO LONGER GUARANTEE A LAUNCH. THE GUYS IN THE SILOS MIGHT SHOOT EACH OTHER. STICK FLOWERS IN THEIR GUNS. EVERY SIGN TELLS US THE RUSSIANS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WE HAVE SILENT CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD. THEIR PARENTS ARE GOING ON STRIKE, OUR ALLIES, OUR ENEMIES. ALL BLAMING US. PEOPLE WANT THEIR CHILDREN BACK. [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] SIR, YOU ASKED TO BE INTERRUPTED. THE GENTLEMAN WITH HIS NAME ON ALL THE BLIMPS... HE'S THE MAN. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN? YES, SIR. ALL OF US AT LANGLEY AGREE. FBI TOO, BUT... WE'LL NEVER PROVE IT. CALL HIM. IT'S 1:30 IN THE MORNING. CALL HIM, NOW. [ DIALING PHONE ] IS THIS MR. ALEXANDER JEFFRIES? IT IS. ONE MOMENT PLEASE, FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MR. JEFFRIES... WE HAVE NEVER MET. YOU RECOGNIZE MY VOICE? YES, SIR. GOOD. AS OF TOMORROW MORNING, YOU WILL DIVEST YOURSELF OF ALL FINANCIAL HOLDINGS OF COMPANIES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. THIS WILL INCLUDE YOUR IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION OF ALL DIRECTORSHIPS AND OFFICES. AS WELL AS THE SALE OF ALL STOCKS HELD BY YOU, AT THE MARKET PRICES OF TOMORROW'S OPENING. IS ALL OF THIS CLEAR, SO FAR? YES, SIR. STAY VERY CLEAN, MR. JEFFRIES. THE FBI, THE IRS AND EVERY AGENCY UNDER MY AUTHORITY WILL BE ON YOUR TAIL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU SON OF A BITCH! GOOD NIGHT. CHUCK! THE PRESIDENT'S HERE. I BEEN WATCHIN' YOU OUT THE WINDOW, BASKETBALL'S NOT YOUR GAME. COME ON OVER TO ME. I PLAY A LITTLE GOLF. BROKE 90 ONCE. FAIR TENNIS, C PLUS. PRETTY GOOD SERVE, NO BACKHAND. WELL... LET'S GET TO IT. BASEBALL SEASON BEGINS IN APRIL, RIGHT? NO PROBLEM. [ HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD ] [ PRESIDENT: ] THAT'S IT. DADDY, WHAT ARE ALL THE MEN DOING HERE? [ RUSS: ] IT'S ALL RIGHT. ONE THING I... I NEVER REALLY FIGURED ON... WHEN I STARTED OUT WAS... WHEN MY CAREER WAS OVER AND I'D DONE EVERYTHING I WANTED TO DO, I NEVER REALLY GO BACK. JUST GO BACK. TO THE PEOPLE I LOVED. WITHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHING. NEVER KNEW I WAS BUYING INTO THAT. NOT THAT I'D CHANGE ANYTHING. OH. IT'S JUST A PHONE NUMBER. YOU AND I BELONG TO A PRETTY SMALL CLUB. WE OUGHT TO STAY IN TOUCH.
