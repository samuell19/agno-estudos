Police! Police coming through. Make way. Police! Coming through. Make way. Make way. Come on, make way. Police business. Bugger! Is Dom Peter here? No, he's asleep. But he asked me to wait. I got a special delivery for him. It's a little darkie. No, don't do that, don't do that. He's a bolter! Hey! Get out of there. Little bugger, come out of there. - Come out of there. - Is that what we're doing? - Hey?! - What are you doing, Sister? Is it? Come on! - What are you doing? - Come on, I dare ya! Take the paperwork, will ya? Jesus! - What's his name? - He hasn't got one. I'm Sister Eileen. Hey! - What? - You scared him. Oh. Here. What's your name? Hey. Look here, new kid. Ahh. Mm-mm. You want some? Come on. - He's not a joey. - Hmm. Come here. Come on. Come on over. You like that? That's my marmalade. Here, come here. Do... - Want this, yeah? - Hey! He's from the desert, that kid. Go back to sleep. Hello. What's your name? Come on, out you come. You wanna meet everyone? Come on, come out. He's wearing a dress! Good morning, my son. Alright. Go on. Go and join your brothers. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. - Amen. - Amen. Now, ah... there's a new boy who joined us last night. I'm sure you've all met him, but I hope that you will show him the ways of our little family and welcome him into, into the fold. Thank you, Sister. So, as one lamb arrives, another departs. And we are sad, today, that our Johnny is leaving us to begin a new journey. Come forward. That's right. Yep, you've got to bend over it. That's right. Good boy. Dear Lord, I present this lost boy to you so that he may be baptised and join your flock. May the water from your heart wash away all his sins. In the name of our Lord, I baptise you... John. - Thank you, Sister. - Okay. Now, will you all turn to your hymn books, page 62.

Come and get it, boys. I'm sad to see you leave, Johnny. You're a good boy. You look after yourself. Thank you, Sister Mum. Know when to bite your tongue. Michael. Thank you, Sister Mum. Matthew. Thank you, Sister Mum. Steven. Thank you, Sister Mum. James. Thank you, Sister Mum. Henry. Thank you, Sister Mum. Ah, the little new one. Every kid here calls me Sister Mum, 'cause they don't have a mum. And if you ain't got one, you can call me Sister Mum too, okay? Hmm. Alright, now George is here. John? Would you please bless our meal one last time? Yes, Sister. Dear Lord, We ask you to bless this meal that Sister Mum has prepared for us. For this food, we give you thanks. - Amen. - Amen. Grant us, O Lord, we beseech thee a safe journey, so that under thy guidance and the guidance of the holy angels, we may safely reach our destination. St. Christopher, the patron saint of travellers, pray for us, and protect us from evil. In the name of the Father and the Son... In the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. - Amen. Will you write to us, John? Look forward to hearing of your progress. And these, these are your papers. - Keep them safe, you hear? - Yes, Sister. Ohh! Look, it's a miracle. It's a shilling. Just in case. Thank you, Sister. Be a good boy. Ah... Don't get too excited. There's no knife in it. Bye, Johnny. Just don't worry, children. With Michael here, as our new head boy, you know we're going to be in safe hands. Hey, Sister Mum, might we have a cake tonight? In honour of Michael's big day. What do you reckon, boys? - Rum and raisin? Eh? - Yes, please, Sister. Hurry up. Do your bed. And make sure you do my bed as well. Okay. Ahh. Morning, Dom Peter. It's a lovely day. Anyway, I told a lie to a policeman. Well... picked a fight, actually. And, um... Well, all the children are well. And as you can see, we got a new one last night, so... Ahh... Yeah... Wow! What a difference a year makes, hey? Anyway, um... Yeah, come on, son. There's nothing to see here. Yeah, and I baptised Johnny. I'm not sure if it worked, I know it's a priest thing, not a nun thing. Oi! Careful! It's a year to the day, you know? Since he died. Swearing at us while we wiped his bum. Yeah. Well, we haven't been struck down by lightning, yet. I think the Lord might be alright with our little arrangement. - Hmm? - They'll find out. We will be punished. - And they'll send another one. - It doesn't matter to them. As long as we send the profit from the harvest. The Lord will protect us, Sister. Where's that new boy gone? There he is. Hugging a tree. Oi! Hey, cut it out. Come on. Come on. Now, you'll break your arm, eh? Go on. Go play with the other boys. "To the Chief Protector "of Aborigines, Mr Krank. "The boy John has been sent to work on Dermott Downs Station. "While I appreciate that the war "has left many farms light-handed, "the boy's education will suffer "as a result of this premature induction into the workforce. "After all, John is only a boy of 13. "I trust you will see God's wisdom in this. "Yours sincerely, "Dom Peter." Sit back down. Uh-oh! George will have something to say about that. Oi, darkie! Matthew says he wants to fight you. Yeah, I'm going to give it to you. Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! You got him, Matty. Good morning, my sons! Ohhh. It's hot in here. Michael? What's going on here? Michael? Oh, come on. He's so small, and he's not. Sister, last night, I caught Matthew here stealing food. - And this was his punishment? - No. No? Well... You're head boy, now. So what should his punishment be? - Caning. - Caning? We haven't caned a boy in over a year. Is that what you really want? Michael, being head boy brings with it a certain amount of power. But it will also bring you challenges. It is times like this that the Devil will test you, Michael. - You understand? - Yes, Sister. Alright. I'll leave the decision between you and God. Ow! Cut it out! Come on, that's enough. Now get ready for church. Go on, go wash up. Come on, go wash up. Matthew, come on. Matthew! Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Again. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. ...deliver us from evil. - Amen. - Amen. Hey. Steven, he gets two scoops. - Oh! He gets two scoops. - I know. So what happened this morning? Hmm? Oh. I think it's called 'the pecking order'. Ah, they'll sort it out. Now, as you know... today is the first day of the olive harvest. And George will be here to help. Now, many of you were here last year, so you're expected to teach those children who weren't, how the harvest works. Now, in our little family, everyone contributes. When we take pride in our work, we take pride in ourselves. Good Lord. Mum! One, two, three... Oh, ow! It shouldn't sting for too long. Pssss! Hey, you like that jam? That's my jam. George's jam. Good boy, Bear. Good boy, Bear. Good boy, Bear. Got a few bags, George? - Good start? - Yeah, good workers. How's the new boy doing? Yeah, he's doing alright. Good. Needs a name, though. You going to wet his head, too? We'll just call him New Boy for now. You're the boss. Alright, it's lunch, boys. Alright. Right, who'd like a sandwich? Michael, would you hand out the sandwiches? Alright. Yes. Come on, Bear. "To Dom Peter. That's it. "He has been sent." Okay, men, let's get to that rock wall. Come this way. This way here. Hey. Go find the boys. You've got to pull your weight. "He has been sent. "We pray that this ghastly war will soon end, "but until that day he must remain in your care. "We trust, Dom Peter, that you will guard him wisely, "as you guard the lost souls under your charge." That's it. Come on, keep 'em coming. Rocks there. George, Michael fainted! Snake! - Hey? Where? Move, move! - There! Kill it. Go get help. Go, go, go! Shit! Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Come on! Come on, boy. Before the snake told Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, they were oblivious to evil. They thought not bad thoughts and did not bad things. And they were naked in their innocence. Whoa. Come on. Well, quit your gawking. Sister Eileen will put the radio on for yas. Hmm, good idea, Sister. Come on, boys.

Oh, children, you just heard some words that you haven't heard for quite some time. And I pray you'll never have to hear them again. What is it, Sister? It's a great responsibility, Michael. - Quickly, come on. - Alright. Let's get it into the church. - Alright, grab a side. - Okay. Right, grab a handle. One, two, three! Careful, boys. Watch your fingers. Right. Slide him off. Put him down there. Put him up. Good men. Good. Yeah. Oh, blessed Father. He's travelled a long way.
