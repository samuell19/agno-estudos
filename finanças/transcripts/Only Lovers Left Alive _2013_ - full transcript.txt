ADAM: Ooh! ♪ (GUITAR) (TIRES SCREECH) (SIREN WAILS) What are we gonna do with him? I mean, it's not like in the old days when we could just chuck them in the Thames... ...alongside all the other tubercular floaters. Any other ideas? (HOWLING IN THE DISTANCE) Canis lafrans. How lovely. - I think they're clocking you. - Yeah. They're all over Detroit. Come on, Eve. Don't even ask. - Ready? - Yeah. That certainly was visual. (HOWLING CONTINUES) Hello? Good evening. I would like to book two flights. From Detroit to Tangier, travelling at night. (DOORBELL) EVE: Who is it? ADAM: Some rock 'n' roll zombie kids. They're onto me. Yes, well, be grateful it's not the police. Yes, I'm still here. Thank you, yes. Two tickets, first class, leaving and arriving at night, please. Yes, I'm sorry, I know it's complicated. Connecting through London? No, no, I'm sorry. London's no good. Yeah. Is there another connection? Madrid? Madrid's fine. Yes, two travellers, er... no luggage. What about all my instruments? My darling, the world is full of beautiful instruments. I'm gonna find you a magical instrument in Tangier. Yes, just carry on. Can we carry on blood? Kit has the best stuff, as soon as we arrive. Yes, credit card. Which would you like? Yes, er... the names of Stephen Dedalus and... Daisy Buchanan. Chet Atkins. Dates of birth? ♪ (ARABIC MUSIC) Do you need something? Monsieur, Madame. (CONTINUES IN FRENCH) I have something very special for you. Not far to go now. Come on. (SIGHS) Shit, Marlowe, where are you? Adam! (GROANS) Ow! What was that for? Come on. Where are we? Did you find Marlowe? No, but we've gotta go find him. You've gotta get up. Come on. If I can even fucking walk. I have something very special for you. I have what you need. Not what I need. Oh, fuck! Kit! - Bilal. - Madame Eve. (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Monsieur Adam. - Bilal. Come in, come in, please. Come in. Madame Eve, my teacher is not well. This is a very, very bad situation. Very bad. You... you look not good. Please... please. This way. MARLOWE: Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. You look like shit. My old darling. Oh, yeah. What a piece of work is a man! What is this quintessence of dust? What happened, Kit? This is the very last of the good stuff. No more good French doctor. I got some bad stuff. Contaminated. Avoid the hospital here. You've still been scratching away, though, Kit. Well, you know, here and there over the centuries. Bilal. Bilal... ...is an excellent writer in his own right, you know? Maybe not yet. Humility... gets you nowhere. There's the proof of that. Illiterate zombie philistine! The game paid off, though, Kit. You still got the work out there. Never had much choice. It was all... so political. Anyway, I was supposed to be... dead. And now... at last... I shall be. (GROANS) Oh, Eve. Oh, look at that shit. BOTH: What are we gonna do? Well, I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get you that present. Give me all your money, baby. Come on. Now... you're going to stay here, OK? And I'm gonna go around the corner, just for a minute. And no funny business. OK. (WOMAN SINGS IN ARABIC NEARBY) (CROWD APPLAUDS) (SHE THANKS THEM IN ARABIC) Eve, this bird is fantastic. Yasmine. She's Lebanese. I'm sure she'll be very famous. God, I hope not. She's way too good for that. Come on, baby. Look at the bowl. Dalbergia Retusa. It's beautiful. Thank you. 82 percent of human blood is water. Have the water wars started yet? Or is it still about the oil? Yes, they're just starting now. They only figure it out when it's too late. How much of the human body is water? 55 to 60 percent. And how much of the Earth's surface? Well, 70 percent is ocean and... ...then there are lakes... and the rivers. Oh. Fuck. I'm barely still here. We're finished, aren't we? (FOOTSTEPS NEARBY) Tell me now about entanglement, Einstein's "spooky action at a distance". Is it related to quantum theory? Mm.. No, I mean... ...it's not a theory, it's proven. How does it go again? When you separate an entwined particle... ...and you move both parts away from the other, ...even at opposite ends of the universe... ...if you alter or affect one... ...the other will be identically altered or affected. Spooky. Even at opposite ends of the universe? Yeah. Is that what we're thinking? Adam, really! So fucking 15th century. EVE: They are deliciously beautiful, though, aren't they? ADAM: What choice do we have, really? We're just gonna turn them, though, right? How romantic of you. I get the girl, though. Excusez moi.
