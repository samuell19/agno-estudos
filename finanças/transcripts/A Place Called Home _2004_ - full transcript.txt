TRUTH IS, WE WERE A FINE MATCH. I JUST GAVE UP TOO MUCH, THAT'S ALL. - YOUR DAUGHTER IS SOMETHING SPECIAL. DO YOU KNOW THAT IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS BEFORE TULA LET ME INSIDE HER HOUSE? BEFORE THAT I HAD TO TALK TO HERTHROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW. - YEAH, CALI'S ONE TOUGH COOKIE.

BUT... - BUT WHAT? - WELL, YOU'RE A BIT OF A PLAYER. AND I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN TRUST YOU. - AND YOU THINK I CAN GIVE YOU... - MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. BUT IT'S HARD FOR A SMALL TOWN GAL LIKE MYSELF TO RESIST A DANGEROUS STRANGER. - SO I'M DANGEROUS, TOO. - ANY MAN THAT A WOMAN WOULD LET INTO HER HEART WHO CAN JUST UP AND TAKE OFF ONE DAY IS DANGEROUS. BUT THAT IS THE RISK WE RUN. - I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF ME NOW, CAPTAIN. EIGHT YEARS, AND NOT ONE BIT RICHER OR WISER. A LITTLE MORE BROKEN DOWN. A LITTLE FURTHER FROM OUR DREAM. BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO CHANGE THAT. I'VE GOT A MAN CHASING ME. [sighs] SO DON'T YOU EVEN THINK OF BEING JEALOUS WHEN I GET MY NEW LOOK. I'M TIRED OF LIVING IN THE PAST. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY FOR ME. [kissing sound] - WELL, WELL. - YOU'VE GOT THIS PLACELOOKING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. - HELLO! - HELLO, HANK. - [laughs] JAN? HUH. - WELL, WHEN YOU FINISH WITH YOUR WORK, WHY DON'T WE GO FOR ANOTHER SWIM? HANK JUST LOVES TO GO DOWN TO THAT OLD SWIMMIN' HOLE. SO, TULA REALLY WANTED YOU HERE TODAY? - YES. AND WHEN WE'RE DONE HANK AND I HAVE A DATE. WE'RE PUTTING OUT BIRD FEEDERSFOR TULA BY THE RIVER. YOU KNOW THAT LITTLESECLUDED SPOT WITH THE TREES? - IS THAT RIGHT, HANK, THAT LITTLE SECLUDED SPOT DOWN BY THE RIVER? - [clears throat] THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT. - WELL... YOU TWO HAVE A LOVELY TIME. - THE WATERING HOLE, HUH? [snorts] - TULA SAID TO THANK YOU FOR COMING. SHE HAS NOW AGREED TO SEE YOU. - WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS? THE QUEEN? [laughs] [footsteps] - DOESN'T SHE LOOK LOVELY? - [laughs lightly] - WE EXPERIMENTED WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLES. - LOVELY. - I'VE ASKED YOU BOTH TO COME HERE TODAY TO TALK TURKEY. THERE COMES A POINT IN LIFE WHERE YOU HAVE TO QUIT LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT DR. PHIL SAYS. I'VE CHOSEN TO LIVE PRIVATELYIN MY LIFE FOR A REASON. BUT THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE. I AM NOT SELLING MY HOUSE. I'M NOT LETTING ANYONE FORCE ME OUT OF MY HOUSE WHILE I'M STILL ALIVE. I HAVE MY OWN PLANS FOR MY HOUSE. AND I INTEND TO HAVE MR. FORDAND HIS DAUGHTER HELP ME. SO... YOU CAN TELL YOUR BROTHER, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, THE GOLF COURSE PLANNING COMMITTEE. WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME? AND... I'M NOT WILLING IT TO YOU EITHER. TRY NOT TO HAVE A COW. - [laughs] - [snickers] - [clears throat] THIS NEWFOUND INDEPENDENCE MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS TO ACCEPT. I WOULD SUGGEST WATCHING OPRAH. [whispers] IT HELPS. [birds tweeting] - JUST ABOUT GOT IT. THESE THINGS TEND TO BE TRICKY. [cork pops] - [screams and laughs] YOU WASTED HALF OF IT. [laughs] - TO UM... TO GOING WITH THE FLOW. - [laughs] - I HOPE THIS IS A BEGINNING. - HOW ABOUT A CHOICE. [laughs] [thunder sikes] [rain pattering] - [sighs] I HATE IT WHEN YOU SMOKE. YOU COULD BURN THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN. - THE WHOLE PLACE IS BURNING DOWN. DON'T YOU GET IT, DAVE? ALL OUR DREAMS ARE BURNING DOWN AROUND US. - TULA'S ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT, OKAY. NOTHING'S CHANGED. - OH, PLENTY'S CHANGED. SHE'S GOT A LITTLE SUPPORT GROUPAROUND HER NOW. JUST GET 'EM IN WITH US OR OUT OF HERE. - WHO? - HANK FORD. JUST GET HIM IN OR GET HIM OUT. - LOOK, BILLIE, HE'S NOTHING BUT A DRIFTER, OKAY. EVENTUALLY, HE'LL JUST MOVE ON. - YOU THINK SO? - YEAH. - HAVE YOU SEEN THE HOUSE? IT LOOKS GREAT. HE'S EVEN DATING THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER. THIS GOES ON A FEW MORE WEEKS, AND WE'LL NEVER GET HER OFF THAT LAND. - [laughs] OKAY. [dialing phone] CARLA? DAVE JEETERS HERE. IS THE SHERIFF IN? [pen scratching] - THAT'S IT? - FOR NOW, YES. YOU HAVE PROVEN THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF CARING FOR YOURSELF AND PROVIDING FOR THE UPKEEP OF YOUR HOME. THE COUNTY ISN'T IN A POSITIONTO DEEM YOU OTHERWISE. - I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING SO HARD ON YOU BEFORE. I REALIZE THAT YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW. - I DO THIS JOB, TULA,BECAUSE I LIKE HELPING PEOPLE. SOME JUST MAKE IT HARDER THAN OTHERS. - I'M SO SORRY. - [laughs]I MEANT YOUR NIECE AND NEPHEW. YOU WERE FEISTY ALL RIGHT, BUT I DON'T BLAME YOU. I'D FIGHT FOR WHAT WAS MINE. I'VE GOT TO RUN. [muted conversations] - SHERIFF? - HOW MUCH THAT DRIFTER TAKE YOU FOR ANYWAY? - A COUPLE OF BUCKS. - YOU, UH, INTERESTED IN MAKING IT BACK BY HELPING ME OUT WITH SOMETHING? - I'M LISTENING. [knocking] - HEY! - HELLO. - I'M GLAD YOU TWO CAME BY TODAY. I JUST GOT APPROVAL FROM MY BOSS TO THROW A CHARITY AUCTION FOR THE WOMEN'S CENTER. I PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF DONORS WHO HAVE GIVEN GENEROUSLYTO DRIVES LIKE THIS IN THE PAST. SOMETHING WRONG? - [clears throat] - WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? I JUST TURNED THIS REPORT IN THIS MORNING. WHERE AND HOW IS NOT IMPORTANT, MS. KYLES. - DO YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT US TO SIT BACK WHILE YOU AND YOUR DRIFTER BOYFRIEND GET IN THE WAY OF US TAKING WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY OURS? - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME OR HANK. THIS IS ABOUT TULA, AND I SEE NO REASON WHY SHESHOULD BE MOVED OUT OF HER HOME. - THIS REPORT CAME RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BOSS'S OFFICE. YOU WANT TO PLAY HARDBALL, FINE. IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR ME TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND LET HIM KNOW WHAT A QUOTE "WONDERFUL JOB" YOU'VE BEEN DOING. - LIKE LETTING A MAN AND AN UNDER-AGED GIRL WHO OBVIOUSLY HASN'T BEEN IN AFORMAL EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT HER ENTIRE LIFE SQUAT AT AN ELDERLY WOMAN'S HOME? - FIRST, IT'S SUMMER. SO CALI WOULDN'T BE IN SCHOOL ANYWAY. AND, SECOND, YOU KNOW NOTHINGABOUT HANK OR CALI'S PAST. - [laughs] IS THAT SO? - WHAT'S TO ARGUE? THEY WERE LIVING OUT OF THEIR CAR BEFORE THEY CONNED MY AUNT TULA INTO LETTING THEM STAY IN HER GUESTHOUSE. - THERE WAS NO CONNING GOING ON. TULA INVITED THEM IN. - LOOK AT HIS RECORD. - WE'LL GIVE YOU A FEW DAYS TO THINK IT OVER, MS. KYLES. AFTER THAT, DAVE WILL START MAKING HIS CALLS. [birds tweeting] - SO YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO MOVE UP TO TULA'S HOUSE? - SURE, WHY NOT? - WEREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT SAID YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS PLACE AND WE SHOULD MOVE ON? - IT'S GROWN ON ME. - GROWN ON YOU? - HANK, DON'T POUT. - I'M YOUR FATHER. START TREATING ME AS SUCH! - THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START ACTING LIKE ONE. ♪ - BROUGHT YOU A MESS OF TROUT. - [sighs] [unlatches door] OH, ONLY FOUR. - [laughs] EXCUSE ME. I THOUGHT I'D START SMALL AND SEE WHERE IT GOT ME. - I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. DOUGLAS, YOU'RE A SMART MAN. COULD YOU TELL ME SOMETHING? WHY IS IT THAT FIRST THE CAPTAINAND NOW THIS--THIS HANK... WHAT IS ITWITH THIS--THIS BLASTED BOAT? [tap squeaks off] - OH, I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES I THINK A PERSON CAN GET ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE FEAR OF FAILING. SO THEY PUT ALL THEIR TIME AND EFFORT INTO THINGS THAT JUST DON'T MATTER. LIKE FIXING UP AN OLD BOAT. PUTTERING ON A CAR, FISHING. - IS THAT WHY THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF DREAMERS? - WHY THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF FOLKS WHO ARE JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM HAVING EVERYTHING THEY WANT. - THAT WAS THE CAPTAIN. HE JUST COULDN'T RISK FAILURE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIS DREAM. - WE ALL HAVE OUR DREAMS, TULA. I'VE WATCHED YOU FOR 30 YEARS, AND LATELY YOU'VE JUST BEEN HANGING ON, JUST KEEPING OUT THE WORLD. LOOK, YOU CAN PRETEND AS THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE A DREAM, BUT I KNOW DIFFERENT. INSTEAD OF JUST HANGING ON, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET GO? JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST THIS ONCE... GO FOR IT. - OH, GO WASH UP. [country music plays] - EXCUSE ME, WILL YA? - I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT OR NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, SHERIFF? CAN I DO THAT OR NOT? - I MAKE IT A POINT TO KNOW EVERYONE IN MY TOWN, HENRY CLINTON ALOYSIUS FORD. CLINTON ALOYSIUS. - WELL, MY MOTHER, SHE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR, OKAY. - WELL, I DON'T. FORD, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE EDGEOF TROUBLE FOR TEN YEARS NOW. MANAGED TO CUT A SWATH OF COMPLICATIONS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. - NOTHING TOO SERIOUS. - THIS IS MY TOWN. AND THE FOLKS HERE EXPECT METO KEEP IT NICE AND PEACEFUL. PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU'D BESAVING US A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE IF YOU JUST PICK UP AND GET OUT OF HERE, BUT BILLIE AND DAVE JEETERS HAVE SOMETHING HAVE SOMETHING WANT TO SAY TO YOUR FIRST, AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU HEAR IT. - [sighs] THAT WAS FUN. THIS ROUND'S ON ME. [cracks] [birds tweeting] [traffic passing] - HAVE A SEAT. [laughs] THANK YOU FOR COMING, MR. FORD. - [laughs] I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE. [scrubbing] - TULA SAYS IF YOU SPEND AS MUCH TIME DOING THE WORK SHE GIVES YOU AS YOU DO PLAYING EIGHT BALL OR WORKING ON THIS OLD BOAT THIS PLACE WOULD LOOK LIKE A NATIONAL PARK BY NOW. - WHAT ARE YOU GRIPING ABOUT? THOUGHT YOU LIKED STAYING HERE, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU'RE UP AT THE HOUSE. - I'M NOT GRIPING. JUST PASSING A MESSAGE ALONG. - FIRST YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE. NOW, I SWEAR IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LITTLE TULA NAGGING ME ALL THE TIME. [grunts] I MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. - I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE, HANK. I WANT TO LIVE HERE. - WELL, I GUESS YOU DON'T NEED ME THEN. YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT RIGHT HERE. YOU GOT A PLACE TO STAY. YOU GOT SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. - DON'T SAY THAT. - WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT I SAY OR DO? YOU WANT TO STAY HERE? WE BOTH KNOW YOU'D BE BETTER OFF IF YOU DID. - BUT, HANK, WHAT ABOUT--- YOU CAN'T EVEN CALL ME DAD! [drops wrench] - GOSH DARN IT! WHY CAN'T YOU ALL JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?! [seagulls squawking] - HELLO, UP THERE. I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE. I COULD REALLY USE THE ASSISTANCE OF A KINDLY-HEARTED PERSON. - SHERIFF. - DOC. - SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND? - DOC, THE DRIFTER AND HIS KIDHAVE GOT TO GO. - WHY WOULD THAT BE, SHERIFF? - I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD REASON WITH TULA SOME. - REASON WITH HER? YOU MEAN, TELL HER TO KICK 'EM OUT SO BILLIE AND DAVE CAN SWOOP RIGHT IN? - DOC, DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE. - DON'T TRY TO TALK TO ME LIKE WE'RE FRIENDS. YOU JUST GO ON BACK AND TELL THOSE TWO VULTURES THAT THINGS ARE CHANGINGFOR THE BETTER IN TULA'S LIFE, AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, THAT'S ALL. - ALL RIGHT, HAVE IT YOUR WAY. BUT DON'T SAY I DIDN'T GIVE YOUTHE CHANCE TO MAKE IT EASIER. - IS THAT A THREAT, SHERIFF? - [laughs] NO, DOC, IT'S NOT A THREAT. - GOOD. [sighs] [jazz music playing] - YOU'RE LATE, BUT AT LEAST YOU CAME. NOW, ISN'T THIS NICE? WE CAN FINALLY HAVE SOME TIME TOGETHER. - [laughs] - YOU'VE BEEN SO BUSY. - [sighs] - THINGS COULD BESO MUCH BETTER FOR YOU, HANK. - YOU GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT BETTER? - MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. - YOU KNOW, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, BILLIE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I CAME HERE TONIGHT. - BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS IS THAT YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT? DID YOU HAVE TO SNEAK OUTBEHIND THE SOCIAL WORKER'S BACK? - [sighs] - OH. YOU DID. SO THAT'S WHAT HAS YOU SO TENSE. - THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO LET'S DROP IT. - AWFULLY TOUCHY FOR IT NOT TO BE. BUT, OKAY, IT'S DROPPED. - I JUST CAME TO TELL YOU I CAN'T AND I WON'T BE BOUGHT. I'LL MOVE ON WHEN I'M READY TO. IT MIGHT BE A WEEK. IT MIGHT BE A YEAR. BUT IT WILL BE ON MY TERMS. - [sighs] DON'T BE A FOOL, HANK. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'VE GOT IT MADE AT OLD AUNT TULA'S, BUT YOU BETTER THINK TWICE. SHE'S PROBABLY GOT YOU WORKING LIKE A DOG, DOESN'T TREAT YOU MUCH BETTERTHAN A MANGY ONE. - YOU DON'T KNOW. - OKAY, SHE DIES IN A WEEK OR A YEAR, AND YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK. IT'S JUST MORE TIME SPENT WITHNOTHING TO SHOW FOR YOUR EFFORT. - PROBABLY. BUT AT LEAST I'LL HAVE THAT MEMORY OF ME AND YOU AT THE SWIMMING HOLE TO KEEP ME WARM AT NIGHT. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO HAVE DINNER WITH JAN. - [sighs] - HEY. HOW'S YOUR BOYFRIEND? - HE'S NOT WITH YOU. SO I MUST BE JUST FINE. - HE WAS JUST WITH ME. MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK HIM ABOUT US. - I DON'T REALLY CARE TO KNOW. - [laughs] WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID? - MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF THE SAME QUESTION. BESIDES, HOW IS MY RELATIONSHIPWITH HANK ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS? - [laughs] YOU, I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT. HANK, ON THE OTHER HAND-- - DON'T LIKE LOSING OUT TO LESSER COMPETITION? IS THAT IT? - YOU SAID IT, NOT ME. - YOU KNOW, BILLIE, YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU HAVE LIFEAND MEN ALL FIGURED OUT. BUT UNDERNEATH IT ALL, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE JUST BITTER AND LONELY. AND ALL OF THIS DOESN'T ADD UP TO MUCH. - YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSETHAT'S THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE. ALWAYS SECOND PLACE, SECOND CHOICE, AND A SECOND THOUGHT TO MEN. - AND WHAT ARE YOU? A GOOD TIME AND A STORY WITH THEIR BUDDIES OVER A BEER? OH, YEAH, BILLIE, I'M REALLY JEALOUS OF YOUR POWER OVER MEN. HAVE A FUN NIGHT.

WHEN DOC AND I GET BACK FROM BOULDER, THEN WHY DON'T WE ALL TAKE A RIDE AROUND THE LAKE? MR. FORD, PLEASE DON'T "YES MA'AM" ME. MY NAME IS TULA. LIFE IS SO FULL OF SURPRISES. AFTER THE CAPTAIN DIED, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I COULDFIND LOVE OR HAPPINESS AGAIN. EVERY DAY WAS THE SAME, AND THE NEXT HELDNO MORE PROMISE THAN THE LAST. BUT THEN THESE TWO PEOPLE ENTERED MY LIFE, AND THEY WERE EVEN MORE LOST IN THIS WORLD THAN I WAS. WHERE I THOUGHT THAT I COULDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE AGAIN, MY WORLD WAS SUDDENLY OPENED TO A NEW LOVE, LIFE, AND FAMILY. MY EYE OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS. AND WHAT I NOW SEE IS OPPORTUNITY TO CHASE MY DREAMS. AND ALONG THE WAY I HOPE TO MAKE SURE THAT HANK AND CALI FINALLY HAVE A PLACE THAT THEY CAN CALL HOME.
