You know... we won't be able to pay the employees and meet our date of payments at the end of the month. What? The bank refuses any more overdraft. What are you saying? I didn't want to worry you. As we can't push back the drafts they will be disputed. This time it's foreclosure. How is it possible? I don't understand. We've always worked together. You will help me, right? I'm not your partner. I'm only your commercial manager. But you have money... No I don't. You know it. But then...how did you do for your country house? For your week-ends in Paris every friday? It's a nightmare. I could sell my jewels. -You would not get a quarter of the price. My jeweler was an honest man. -Honest or not you'll see when he buys them from you. You must help me! -I already told you I had nothing. You have nothing... -No. But Julien you...love me... We must prevent the foreclosure at any price. We can mortgage the factory. -Of course that's one solution. My lawyer will probably lend me $5 million over the factory. -You know that you registered the factory to the name of a civil society. But it changes nothing. -You forget that I'm the main shareholder. But the factory belongs to me. You're just a nominee. I'm fed up being your nominee. The factory is mine. -You're crazy. You have signed blank shares. They're not in the safe anymore. I teared them up when I registered my shares. I'm the rich owner of a factory worth 150 millions. This is the offer that was made to me. Mr Garnier you can't let him do such a thing. This perfume factory is in the family for 150 years. -Are you sure that these blank shares have disappeared? Yes. They're not in the safe. He had the key. I trusted him so much. I believed in him. He was also my father's best administrator. -It didn't prevent him to ruin your business. Of course... You're right but it's difficult to admit. Mrs Lombardi, you can always count on me. Mr? -Mrs Lombardi? I'm sorry Mrs. We act to Mr Auchard's request. He sent you a demand for payment that stayed unanswered. Are you able to pay? With what money? Go on. timings : meatisgood translation : aloysius70 Cinemaggedon exclusive - Not for sale And this? Can you let me keep it? I love it so much. Unfortunately we have orders to take everything. The sale will cover only a small part of the sum. Well... go on. Good luck! If you're thirsty the bar is over there. 60.000. Don't you think it's fair? No. It's ridiculous. I paid twice that sum. Don't forget that the resale price is not the buying price. Jewels are assets. Of course. Your concept of capital is not mine. Wait. I make you a last offer. 80.000. It's all I can do. Really? Very well. Pay me in cash. Where are you going Mrs? Place des Ternes. -Impossible. My day is over. I'm going to Montparnasse. Well, to Montparnasse then. I'd like a room with bathroom. There is room 12 with view on the yard. You want to visit? -No, it's fine. Don't bother. I have just one bag. Will you please fill your sheet? -Of course. Thank you. I can't read your name. Lucille Lagrange. You want? Two tubes of Numbothal please. You have the prescription? -It's an old one. -It doesn't matter. Ok. Very well. To what name and what adress? -Diana Stevani. Verona. Thank you. Sir, I'd like some caviar. Big size grain. The biggest you have. -How much? 250 ounce. No it's too small. More. That's it. There. And then... Some Champagne. -Which one? Taitinger '59. 25 th January. My dear Julien... I write you this letter hoping it will hurt you as much as possible. What can I say? I'm still attached to feelings of revenge, love and hate. You're responsible for my death. It's stupid. Stupid. It would make him so happy. How to hurt him? Real bad. If I... If I killed him. What day is today? He's in Paris every friday morning. Every friday. Friday... One week of respite. What kind of car is that? The English car there? -Yes. An Austin Princess. -It's a good car? The Queen's car! Almost entirely handmade. Never out of fashion. It's guaranteed to never break. The more it runs more it gets younger. Catch the driver. Sir! Sorry Sir! Yes. -Your car's for sale? Yes. I'm buying. -You make a good deal. Do you want to take an appointment? -No, I want it now. Like this? -Yes. How much does it cost? -Three millions. Perfect. I got the sum with me. Stop at the next crossroad. Alright. Tires are new. Snubbers have been checked up. Here are the keys. But we must have an appointment for the assurance and the papers. -Ok, I'll come to see you one of these days. Just let me say thanks then... The Queen has good taste! You have a permit Miss? Yes of course. In my bag. Cool... It's not loaded, huh? -Absolutely not. Don't you have it... in a clearer tone? There. If you want to have a look please. Thank you. That's it. It's more clear. Yes but this... It's not very handy. Of course... Here. This one is better. But no... That one. It's great but... Don't you have a very small one? Very small. Yes. Can you wait a minute please? Of course. I'm hungry. But not alone... This one? Above all... no mustache. Mister can I invite you... Where did you buy this mink coat? It's a gift. -Lucky boy. Sir? Mrs? Can I... What time is it please? 20 to one. -Thank you. Sir? Mrs? 20 to one in case you didn't hear. What a jerk! Sir? Yes? I'm inviting you to lunch. Sorry? I'm inviting you to lunch. Just like that? Yes. Just like that. Let's go then. Although I'm a Parisian it's the first time I'm coming here. Me I come from the South. There's nothing like country people to help you visit the capital. You're not impressed by the height? That? Not at all. I'm used to ocean depths. Why? What are you doing in life? -I'm raising up wrecked ships. Wrecked ships? I have a little job for you. It's very good. What did they put inside? Some kummel. But it's a mistake. They should have strenghten it with some mirabelle. Or some plum. -Really? Anyway they were wrong to cook the strawberries. It must be served cold. With an orange juice and half a lemon. You're a cook? Yesterday I was a burgess. Admit it's curious... What? The way all this happened. It's curious. It's the first time it happens to you? -Of course. But don't be so surprised. I guess I'm not the first man to be invited to lunch like this. At first I thought that... Yes? I thought that... Well in my case every man would have thought the same thing... I thought that you... That I was a prostitute? -Yes. You're an easy client anyway! And now? You don't think so? -No. And why? If I have the experience that you lend to me I can recognize a woman from... from... from... Come on, say it! You sure you're never wrong? Not in this domain. Why did you do this? I wanted to talk to someone. Don't you have friends? Yes... but most of them are on the Riviera and... I wanted to change. Why? When you want a change in your life there's a reason? What's yours? Don't you think it's a bit odd to have lunch together 100 meters above the ground without knowing each other? As far as I'm concerned I have a pleasant time. Life is beautiful. You're nice. The cooking is okay. It's a way to see things. Nonetheless even a fortuitous meeting create bonds between people. Don't you think? Let's say it's the case. It's obvious. Otherwise it would have been more simple not kidnapping me in an Austin Princess, not coming to me in the street and not inviting me to lunch. And now you're interrogating me. You put yourself into this position. What do you want to know exactly? My life? Well, I'm born in Italy. I came to Paris, I live in a small hotel in Montparnasse. I lived a great romance not so long ago. I thought I was a business woman but I was wrong. I wanted to fly from my own wings. But they broke. To resume, like people say, I commited the sin of pride. And now I realize who I really am. A country woman from another century. You start a new life from scratch. From scratch. But I don't start a new life. A lot of people found themselves in your situation and managed to overcome it. You hide something from me. Not at all. You're a bad liar. It's not serious anyway. -It's for me to judge. You wouldn't believe me. -You can always try. I'm going to kill myself. You'll have another coffee? Please... Ask the wine waiter to bring us some alcohols. If I remember well you have a wonderful raspberry liquor. You like raspberry? Yes. -Right. You can't do that. Why? You think I was serious? -Yes. I was joking. -Not at all. You were not joking at all. Your behavior is proof enough. Looking at you anyone can see you're indifferent to everything. You're able to do anything. You're becoming melodramatic. Melodrama is real. I'm not very glad to be the witness of its existence. I agree. But there are so many people tired of living. You'd be too busy preventing all of them. It's different with you. You happened in my life. I can't... -You can't do what? I can't let you do that. Until friday... You're not going to lock me in? It's friday that...? I said friday? Well... Starting now I'm not leaving you alone. Not at all? -No. Can I make a phone call at least? This? It's not for me. Head waiter. Sir? -The bill please. It's done Sir. What do you mean? -The lady just paid. Good evening Mrs. I'd like a suite. -Of course. For how long? One week. Almost a week. Please sign here. Yes. What name shall I write on your sheet? Lise Ducreux. Born in Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin. Write the birth name of your choice. Do you have luggage? -No. I'll receive them tomorrow. There's a terrace. Do you want to have a look? No thanks. Please bring me a tootbrush and some toothpaste. You have everything in the bathroom. Thank you. News item. Revenge, love and death. A young woman kills her lover and then kills herself. But... until friday... What am I going to do? I must change. I must have fun. Sorry. Hello. How are you big girl? Thank you for everyone to come here. I think we can start now. First question please? Please. For France 4... For Israeli News. What will happen the day you stop to sing? I mean...What will you do the day you're out-fashioned? Who are they? -The Timothys. 120 broken seats at their concert last wednesday. 24 faintings. 8 bouts of hysteria. They even made the Queen laugh. It's their first stay in France. Melodirama tonight and the Olympia. You seem to be well informed. -I'm the french correspondant in Paris for the New-York News. My name is John Burt. -Yes another question? And him? -It's their manager. Tom Sturges. No he says he's moon sick. What are you doing when you sneeze? I have such a cold... For? -For... For... For Switzerland Today. I have a big news for you ladies and gentlemen. Our friends will all marry together on the 15th february in Liverpool! Are you really Switz Miss? -My mother is sicilian. Bravo! You're wonderful. You have great marketing ideas! -10 percent. Of course. You're coming to see us tonight? -Why not? Hello? Hi Tommy? You're not too mad at me? Good. Tonight? Tonight... Tomorrow? I can't. It's not that I'm out of reach. I'm just busy. Come in! I'm not talking to you. Give me the card. The card for the flowers. Thank you. Alright. Yes... Great! Yeah right! Absolutely. John Burt. French Correspondant... would be happy to invite you... What? Not at all. Absolutely. Impossible. Call me tomorrow. Thank you. Hello? Please tell me. At which time the plane coming from Nice lands in Paris next friday morning? Ok. Thank you. Yes. I was waiting for you... You wear a great tan... Can you come at my place for five minutes? Only five minutes. We were afraid for you. -Me too. Give me a cigarette. Here. What happened? I was blocked by a boiler pate. Prepare some explosives for tomorrow. I will blow everything. You think it will be finished in ten days? -It must be. I don't want to miss the Caraïbes contract and the 100.000 bucks. Miss? I'm sorry. Hello Sir. You recognize me? Of course. -Do you remember the young woman with me at this place yesterday? -The young blonde woman who left suddenly. Exactly. You know her? She's a regular client here? Not at all. It's the first time she came here. You're sure. -Absolutely. I never forget a face. Did she pay you by check? No. She paid in cash. I'm sorry. Me too. Hello Mr Inspector. Mr Inspector please. It's about a missing people. -Who's missing? A woman. -Your wife? No. She's a young woman who... Well. Her name, age and last adress? That's the point. I don't know. All I know is that she comes from Nice. She lives in a Montparnasse hotel. She's blonde, very pretty. And she's around 25 years old. It's not much. Your description fits a lot of women. Yes, I know. By the way why are you so sure she disappeared? Well in fact she didn't exactly disappeared... It's not clear. She's missing or not? -It's more complicated. I met her yesterday for the first time. She came to me in the street. Really? I see you coming too. Not at all. It's really not what you think about. At first I found that story rather funny. She took me to lunch at the Eiffel tower. Strange idea. -You think so? Anyway she confessed she wanted to commit suicide at the end of the lunch. And another one! -I'm sure I'm not wrong. She was completely distressed. There was something in her eyes... Anyway. She told me this only because I was in front of her. She even gave me the date of ... -Of her death? Yes. It's friday. -We're only monday. Four days. -Of course, it's a very urgent case. In your place I wouldn't worry so much. -But she has a gun in her purse. Article 20 of the penal code. -You're going to do something then? Come back wednesday and I'll give you some news. -Wednesday? And it's only because I'm a sentimental man. Hello. -Hello Sir. I'm sorry to ask but would you have among your clients a young blonde woman with a slender silhouette and coming from Nice? -Who are you? It's a friend of mine. I lost her adress but I know she lives in the neigborood. What's her name? -To crown it all I forgot her name. It's on the tip of my tongue but no way to remember it. It's silly. Anyway we don't have slender shaped ladies here. And not a single one comes from Nice. Well then... See you soon. I'm looking for a blonde lady around 25 coming from Nice. No but I have a brunette around 18 coming from Hamburg. Not really, no... Good bye. You're right. This young lady was here three days ago. A certain Lucille Lagrange. -Are you sure. Of course Sir. Lucille Lagrange doesn't exist! I cannot made her up! Get your little cards out. Make a real investigation. This woman is going to kill herself! We know our job. You're a swell guy but please leave me alone. -Only when you will have found her. I'm warning you that if you keep like this you'll spend the night here. -Bravo! It's the best you can do. But why this woman matter so much to you in the end? And what does it matter to you what it matters to me? -Me I don't care. What do you want me to do? Give me a real name, an adress... A telephone number, a plate number... You really think I had the time to think about her plate number. All I know is that she drives an Austin Princess with a registration number 75. And then? You want me to investigate on all the Austin in Paris? Genius! You're a genius! See you soon. Good bye. Thanks. Hello Sir. You confirm I'm at Mrs Chambord's apartment, owner of An Austin Princess registered... -Absolutely. It's here? -Yes Sir. It's, it's... not really necessary. Please follow me. Sorry. I was waiting for you Sir. No Mrs, it's impossible. You see... I'm doing an investigation on... the Austin Princess owners in Paris. Well on the female owners more precisely... Sit down Sir. It's destiny sending you. No, it's not the destiny. It's about your car, I'd like to know if... Sit down now! But Mrs, I guarantee you, you're making a mistake. Your hands Sir. -My hands. I'm investigating. Shut up Sir or he'll escape. Who? -The spirit. Spirit... Are you here? If you're here strike thrice. He's here! Miss... Oh no! I'm investigating on the Austin Princess. At 11 o'clock in the evening? -It's very important. Do you really own an Austin Princess registered... I hate interrogatories. -Darling, who's here? A bloody nuisance. I don't have time to explain. I must absolutely see the woman upstairs. -I'm going to throw you out! What's happening? But you're completely nuts! I become nuts. How much? -Nothing Mrs. All is paid for. What do you mean? -The perfume and the small package. But I only ordered the perfume. Ah Senorita! Senorita since we met in the elevator I... It was not me. It's imposible. I never take the elevator. My suite is at the first floor. I couldn't stop telling myself "My dear Alberto..." Alberto it's me. By the way let me introduce myself. Alberto de Vilalonga, Buenos Aires. Pleased to meet you. -Very pleased, very pleased. So I was telling myself... "My dear Alberto, my old friend, this perfect woman... there's something missing her. -You think so? Yes. -Me I don't. Open it. Why? You want to buy me? With that? What? Me buying you? Never Senorita. It's only in your hommage that I thought... I'm a very honest woman. -Of course you are. Here. Thank you for her. One doesn't meet a woman like you every day. So I would be very happy to know you better. It's starting again... John Burt. How are you? John Bert. Alberto de Vilalonga, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Telefono 00001. Your paper on the Timothys, it's for when? -Friday. What time is it? Four o'clock. -Four o' clock? I'm very late. It's important. -Very important. -Can I go with you? -Yes. -Me too? -Yes, you too. Stupid cunt! Can't you let people die when they want to? Filthy rich! You don't know what it means to want to die! Can't you stay in your golden bogs and leave people alone? Fuck you! You hear me? Get out of my sight! You should be given the Legion of Honour! I'm looking for a friend. Her Austin Princess is the only way for me to find her. A policeman friend gave me the list of the owners and you're the last one. Your list was accurate until last sunday. I had an Austin Princess herited from my aunt but it was not my type of car. So I sold it. To whom? -To someone in the street. It was unexpected and very funny. To whom? -A charming young woman, blonde and slender. -It's her. There's no doubt. What's her name? -You said it was one of your friends? It was a joke but don't be mad at me. It's just that I'm so happy. -Maybe you won't believe me but I don't know her name. -What do you mean? It happened so quickly. She had to come here for the insurance and the papers. But I'm still waiting for her. She won't come. -Come on, it's impossible. This car doesn't belong to her as long as the papers are not in order. She doesn't care. Still two days. You can't imagine how serious is the situation... Please. Three bottles of rose Taittinger '47. Alright. -You like all these men around you? What men? I love them! Don't you find them dreadfully funny? Are you free to diner tonight? -It's difficult. Very. Very difficult. -And apparently it will soon be more difficult yet. Look who's coming... What are you doing tonight? Don't know. Right now I'm having the time of my life. I'm inviting you to diner. -I asked before you. -I'm sorry... but Lise promised me. You can't take her to diner three times. Then it's me inviting you all three! -To the four of us! Alright, let's have a toast! Why did you do that? Are you completely crazy Of course I'm not crazy. I won my bet! You're worth a midnight swim, don't you think? You could at least have taken all your clothes. All naked? -Of course. How horrible! Completely naked! I think we drank too much. -Not me, I pretend to be drunk. But now I'm catching cold and there's no heater in your car. -You earned it! It was worth it, huh? Since we're alone now the two of us. Are you sure? Don't you? Take the wheel. What's wrong? What's the matter? Something bugging you? -No, it's nothing. You sure? You come with me? You don't feel well? Oh it's you... What day we are now? Go change your clothes. -You're right. I'm back in a second. You found out my little treasure... -What is it? This... This and a good strong dring is great to chase out black ideas. Are you ready? Not like this. Give it to me. It didn't work. I feel nothing. Hello. Hello. You're alone? Yes I'm alone. How much? How much for what? How much to stay alone? No. How much to stay with me? 300 francs. Say, I never saw you before. No. -You're new? Yes. Take this. To celebrate my beginnings. Are you crazy? No. Superstitious. Amongst the news items we must mention the failed suicide attempt of an unknown woman. The brand of her clothes make the police think she comes from Nice. She threw herself under a truck last night. She's now in Hospital Bichat in a very critical condition. Mrs... Mrs... -Yes. Who's speaking? -It's me. It's François. The man at the Eiffel tower. You remember? It's nice of you. But who are you? We'll talk about that later. Sleep now. And don't make another foolish thing like that. Hello Yvette. Nothing new? The people from Marseilles were here yesterday to study with you the Suez contract. The south-american man is waiting for you since 20 minutes. -Shit! The Caraïbes contract completely depends of him. I'm sorry. Don't worry. I understand perfectly. I have a lot of troubles these days. I hope Yvette has offered you something to drink. Good god, did you get a look at the clock? I'm sorry. I'm still in yesterday evening's mood. I can understand. I've had a rather busy night myself. You know what the people say about french women... Not really. -Anyway show me the plan. It's there. You know, the deadlines are too shorts, and the funds insufficient. A ship of 8 tons burden can't be raised so easily. Look. Lovely... Thanks. I was talking about that girl. It's too bad. It's too bad that you weren't there. It's that stupid manager who ended the night with her. It's overhanging on the coral where sharks are swarming. I thought about this. Hello? -It's six o' clock Mrs. Six o'clock? In the evening? In the morning. In the morning? Why are you weaking me up so early? -Today is friday Mrs. What? Friday. -Friday? Friday... Julien! What are you doing here? -I was waiting for you. Why? -I want to talk to you. I thought all had been said between us. -Not entirely. Meanwhile and with your permission I'm going to have breakfast. -Good idea. Me too. You look wonderful. Is it a reproach? -Not at all. So much happened since we... I've changed. -Stop acting. Julien. Let's be realistic. I have a proposition for you. Shoot. Last week you said you were ready to sell the factory, well your factory, against 150 millions. It's true. -Well... I'm buying. Is this a joke? -No, I'm serious. I've found a sleeping partner. A handsome young man probably. Handsome... and young. -And I guess you'll nominate him commercial manager. No. This time it's him nominating me commercial manager. And he has 150 millions to spare. -He has much more. Listen. The buying contract is ready. I'm asking you to read it today. I'm sorry but I'm waited in Chantilly. It will take you 5 minutes. I'll drive you after. It's my car. You inherited from someone? -The handsome young man is also very generous. I hope you didn't take too seriously all the things I've said to you in Nice. All these financial issues got me on edge. -You were the same I guess. Don't worry. You know, I'm not only shortsighted. I also have a bad memory. Sit down. And if we talked about this contract? -Of course. I know that you're in a hurry. But you can slow down 5 minutes. You want to drink something? Of course you want. About these millions. Give me details. You have a sleeping partner? When will you introduce him to me? When you want. Tomorrow. Eleven o'clock? Alright. Here? I find you in great shape. It's true. You stay the same. You know... You can't wear a tie these days. It's outdated. Sometimes even a shirt is too much. You see that? It's funny and easy to take off. Look here. And the contract? A moment. And now you'll do everything I want. I'm going with you in Chantilly. I'm sorry for my lateness. -Please, it's nothing. Your project is excellent. I didn't expect less but still I'm very happy. -Thank you. There's just a small detail to sort out. You're not feeling well? I'm OK, don't worry. -It won't take long anyway. You're completely crazy! Slow down! I beg you. You see the pylon there? At the end of the road? -Yes. And then? Look at it carefully. Julien. It's the last thing you'll see. Don't miss it. You disgust me so much that it saves your life. That's it. If you manage to raise the boat in this deadline you won't regret it. You will earn enough money to take holidays for ten years. You look strange... It's the last day. What do you mean? A strange thing happened to me. My bill please. -It's ready Mrs. It doesn't bother you if I leave my stuff in the room? Not at all Mrs. When will you come to take them? Tonight. -At your service. Thank you. Why do you worry? You tried your best. Say... don't tell me that... That? You saw this woman only once. I know. -You can't fall in love with a shadow. Or a dead woman. Do you want me to drive you home? No thanks. I have my car. Let's finish this first. When does it go up? -In three minutes. We can't go up now? No. Three minutes is three minutes. The two elevators rotate.
