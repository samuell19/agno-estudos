But it seems like my life is not headed to any direction. At least you are living up to your age. You can do anything that you want. Unlike me, everything is controlled. Oh! Kristy, I envy you a lot. Because you have a lot of admirers. And not just any admirers, they're all professionals. But me, it ends here. Everything is only a dream. And I'm just making the pictures of my illusions. I want to fall in love. That true love. I want to go crazy in love. Know what, Angie, in these times… if you want to do something, do it! If you want to get something, get it. You've got to fight for it. Do what I want to do? And get what I want to get? You're right, Kristy. Don't worry, I'll take note of that. How about you, Bes? You're the prim and proper one, amongst us three. What are your plans? What I want is just simple. Finish my studies, serve my mom, and to meet Mr. Right. And then, marry and have three children. To have three kids is easy, but to meet Mr. Right, that's impossible. I tell you. There's no Mr. Right nowadays. All of them are Mr. Going Left. There's still some. Look! A guy! Hi, Girls! Hi! Don't you have a name? Let's go for scuba diving. Why not? Just show me the way, Scuba Man. I envy Kristy. Her butt was already held. The modern Filipina is liberal, but not in the sense the she lets herself fall in the pits of immorality. The modern Filipina is a participating member of our society. She's not merely homebound, but is very, competent and active in country's progress. This is the purpose by which Colegio de Sta. Monica was built. Hey, friend! Look at this! Look at this! One is missing. Girls! Girls! What's happening there? What's that? Sister Agatha! Look at Barbara. She's reading Playguy Magazine. Full of nudes. Sister, this is not mine. Barbara, give me that magazine. And please, see me in my office later. You're so annoying. Leave me alone. Look, Angie. I'm only asking you an hour of your time. I'm only asking you to accompany me to the gallery in Makati, okay? I'll just check something there. Some new painting collections. Annoying! What, is it hard for you? But I still have to review. My God. You're obviously going to fail, why would you still review? You're right. But my mom or my dad might see me, they're going to hit me. Come on, Angie, let's accompany her. Let's give a chance on what Kristy likes. Anyway, Mrs. Poblador already left. She's on her maternity leave. Is it true, bes? Mrs. Poblador already left? Yes. You're so annoying. Finally! What? You're happy now? Her replacement might probably be more inconsiderate. You got a point. But the important thing is, I was able to breathe. I hope they won't be able to get a replacement for her. And completely abolish that computer subject. Excuse me. Where is the Dean's Office? Sir, just straight ahead, then turn left. Thank you. Wow! Hey! What? He's handsome. - Crazy! - He's handsome. He might be Sister Agatha's boyfriend. Now, what? Are you going to accompany me or not? Let's go. Just like what is written in the manual. I'm sure, you are not new to these cases. Yes, I know the rules very well. I assure you. I will not ruin the school's name. Most especially my credibility. In that case, I'll see what I can do. Very well, Dean Lucero. Thank you very much. You're so hard to understand. You said we'll go straight home after visiting the gallery. But what are we waiting for here? Angie. You know you might have drunk too much coffee. Keep it cool. Who are you waiting for? Tell us. Is it Rupert? No. It's Gringo. I think he still wanted to wait for another cool here in Makati. Oh, he is here. I'm here! Am I late? Not really. We just arrived. - No! We were waiting for a long time. - Angie! Come on, get in. Hey! What are you going to do if Rupert finds out? Don't worry, sweetheart. He's not even doing anything. Okay! Oh? Bes? Angie? You might want to go back to school. How about your car? I'm going to go back later and get it. Or better yet, do you want it? Bye! Crazy! Stupid. Oh, thank god! Bessie, we just received a big amount of money! Oh, what did your registrar say? I requested them that I'm going to pay my tuition soon. Tell them, tomorrow, you will pay them. Thank you, Mother David. Mother David, I don't know how to thank you. I owe who I am today to you. Bessie, I don't want to hear that. You don't owe me anything. Know what, Bessy, your success is my success. Mother David, I promise, you will not be disappointed. No, Angelica. Women nowadays are not only housewives anymore. And now, you'll tell us, you're going to shift? But Dad, I'm really poor in Accounting. Anything… Anything with numbers, I can't do it. But your Dad and I won't let you be your husband's cook, and your child's maid. You should be a successful career woman. Like me! But mom, I want to become an ideal housewife and a good mother. Mom, I didn't say that. Well, you don't have to stay in the house to prove that you are a better wife or a better mother. If you have the money you can get all these maids to do the work for you. No, Angelica. You are to become what your father and I now. But I'm not like you. Angelica! I don't want to hear anymore from you. What you want is not going to happen. You are going to follow us… your mom and I. We know what's best for you. Is that understood? Yes, Dad. My, my, what a pleasant surprise? Hi Vic. Hi. When did you arrive? Just a while ago. I just dropped by to visit my favorite niece. Well, you're always welcome in this house. You know that. Thank you. How about Marita? As usual, we can't find her. That's why staying in this house is so boring. I'm going out for a drink. If you need anything, just tell the maids. Kristy is in her room. See you later. See you. - Tita Eleanor. - Hello! What a pleasant surprise. - That's what your dad said, too, downstairs. - Come in. Know what, Auntie Eleanor, your beauty is still glowing up to now? Oh, and you, let me look at you. Wow. My niece is so beautiful. I'm speechless. And the body… Oh, of course. Like a model. Auntie, sit down. How are you? No, that's what I'm going to ask you. Oh wait, how old are you? Twenty. Oh, do you have a boyfriend? A lot. What? A lot, but I don't have a steady boyfriend. I can't find true love. So over it. Know what, it will come in an unexpected way. I hope you won't be like me, when I found Mr. Right he ended up with another girl. What do you mean, Auntie? Let's not talk about it. Okay. Oh, how are your collections? Wait, is this another new collection? Yes, Auntie. Who made it? Antonio. Beautiful. I just bought it yesterday, Auntie Eleanor. Will you please define to the class, Societal Marketing Concept? Ms. Asid. Oh no. She deserves it. Societal Marketing Concept? It assu- Sister, wrong. She is just fooling you. Oh well, perhaps you know the answer Ms. Barbara Qui. Oh, now what you got? Well, watch me. Watch her. Excuse me, Sister. But she is wrong. Quiet! Quiet! - She said, "Quiet." - Quite! Stop that! Societal Marketing Concept is the management orientation that holds that And to deliver satisfaction more effectively, and efficiently than its competitors in a way that preserves the consumers and societies well-being. Very good! There. That's the answer. [Bell rings] Okay, class, listen! Prepare for a test next meeting. Thank god, the bell rang. - That's true! - She really think she's good, right? Good morning! I'm Serge Malapas, and in the absence of Mrs. Poblador, I'm taking over this class. So we'll definitely seeing each other from now on. If it's fast, tell me. Pascal Programming is a language based on a theory of structured programming. I'm sure, your previous instructor has taught you this concept already. But as a review, we will be discussing this concept once more. The three fundamental structures of Pascal Programming are as follows; Concatenation or joining, decision-making or branching, iteration or looping. Oh, Sir? In Concatenation, all statements used in a program Hey you! What do you want? Are you intentionally doing it? If you don't want to get hurt, don't play. One more mistake, I'll punch you in the face. Punch her now! Oh, game! Oh come on. Start the game. Game! Oh, she got hit. Sir, sorry. Sister. Ms. Asid. Sir? What happened to your cute mole? Oh? Angie, the ball! [inaudible] Oh, wrong. Sister Mola. Here. Here. Here, get it. Mister Police, what happened? Who are you? I live there. Oh okay, come in. He's laying. I can't see him. Mother David! Mother David! What happened to Mother David? He got stabbed by the two robbers. Oh, bring him to the hospital. Carry him! Carry! I'll come with you. Mother David! Bes. Where? How are you? What happened to Mother David? His chance to live is 50/50. He got two serious stabs in his body. Oh my God. Bessy, have faith. Gather all the strength you can get. Excuse me. Doc, how's my Mother David? Ms. Montalbo, if you're hoping to see the patient now. I will not allow you because at the moment he's under sedation. So I would suggest you to go home, you go home first to rest. Specially you, Ms. Montalbo. We will take care of him here. Right, Bessie. So that you can rest. Thank you, Doc. Okay, so, I'd like to excuse myself ‘cause I have to attend to another patient of mine. I'll see you. So? We're going to drive you home? Okay, Bes? What is this being complaint by Marita? I just told him what you said. I want the answer to come from you that's why I immediately went to Manila. That's what I'm thinking, Dad. Eleanor, is that how easy for you to turn your back at our plantation? I was able to run the plantation well because of your help. Dad, I hope you'll let me face and make things work on my own. If you'll turn your back to the plantation, Almost all my life, I have given to the plantation. And also because of the plantation, I denied myself from my personal life. I have sacrificed a lot of things, I accepted it, even though-- Watch your mouth, Eleanor! Dad, if Eleanor doesn't want to run the, plantation. I'll do it. Let's make it work. Hey! Shut up, Marita. I'm not talking to you. Eleanor! Don't worry, Marita. I erased everything from the past. You might not remember-- - Grandpa! - Dad! Grandpa! Give him water. Get some water. That's what I'm telling you. You keep on shouting and shouting. Relax, Dad. I really admire you. I still need to come to school. How's Mother David? By the way, my Grandpa's also in the hospital. Why? He got a heart attack. I pity grandpa. But anyway, he's okay. It's just a mild stroke. Oh, by the way, Bessie, we know that you need Angie and I's help. So here's our share. Never mind. We shared for that. Thank you, but no. Come on, take this. That's our Bessie. Now what, you're going to go straight to the hospital? Yes, in the hospital. - Come with me. - I'll be fetched. I thought Sir is going to talk to you. Oh, right! But why? I think, he's going to confess his feelings to me. Wait, wait, I'll go to him. Wait, wait, you're going to face Sir, again. Your mole! Oh my, you're right. Where is it place? In my lips? Cheeks? Hey, where? Angie, I don't know. Hello. Oh, Joey? Surprised? What are you doing here? Well, I just thought you wanted to see me so I'm here. Oh, you're so arrogant. What did you say? I said that the clouds are too thick. Shall we go? For a while. Oh, what? Okay. I'll see you tomorrow then. Bye! Joey! - Hi Sister. - Hello Sister. This is my brother. Are you kidding me? Joey. Can you stop? Why? You're so naughty. They might tell this to the Dean. - Go ahead. Come in. - You're really a freak. Oh my. Stop that. Hey, can you accompany me to Sir? Oh, there is Sir! Where? There! Oh! You're right! I think I might pee due to nervous breakdown. Stop that. Ms. Asid, I wanted to talk to you because I don't want you to drop. But Sir, I'm really embarrassed because I'm really not good with computer. You have to pass my subject for you to graduate. But what can I do, Sir? I'm really not good with this. I think you're lacking concentration. Or there's probably something that's disturbing you. You. What? I mean, you're my only hope to pass the computer subject. Okay, do you want me to help you? Sir? I can help you during my free time. Oh, never mind. It's too embarrassing, Sir. Up to you. Sir, when? I'll tell you when. Okay? I'll see you. Wow. Bessy? This is the medicine your Mother David needs urgently. You know here in the hospital, the supplies have a limit. Doc, can you tell me the truth? Is there any, chance my Mother David will go back to normal? Oh, you still have a class tomorrow. Go ahead now so that you won't be home late. Don't worry. I'll check your Mother David every now and then. Bessie, may I invite you out to dinner? This weekend? I know a new place and they serve superb lobsters. Hello. Yes, speaking. Who is on the line, please? Ms. Asid. How did you get my number? I saw it in the record book earlier. Why did you call? Nothing, Sir. Because I'm still worried about our lesson, but I really don't get it. Then I was able to re -remember your offer. What offer? Oh, Sir, you already forgot. Didn't you tell me that you're going to help me on your free time? Oh yeah, that's right. Sorry, okay? It's alright, Sir. I just wanted to ask when is your free time. How about Sunday, Sir? Do you have any plans? Nothing. But I think it'll be better on Monday. 10 o'clock. So that before the class starts, you already know the lesson. Okay, sir. It's up to you. Thank you, Sir! Good night, Sir! Sir? There is someone who wants to give her good night kiss to you. What's that? Sir, that's my pussycat, Sir. Good night, Sir! Don't you have any respect left for your dad? What you want to happen is wrong! Not right! Hey Vicente! If you don't want to lend me fifty thousand to bribe dad's attorney. Let's forget it! But remember this, Vicente, starting today let's not care about each other. My business failed, that's why I want to know what he'll leave me with. You're bullshit, Vicente. Motherfucker! Oh there's Kristy. She has a party later. I allowed her to go. Well, for me, there's no party happening! Well, today it's a no! No dating! You're always like that. Mother! Bessy, how's your Mother David? We still can't talk to her. But you know Ma'am Desta, she's so annoying. Can you please lend me money and add it to our loan? But, what about your loan? Okay, then. Good night, Sir Dado. Oh, this is the last ball, okay? That's five thousand. You were just lucky. Next time, I'll win. Okay, I'll serve first. That's yours. What? [Inaudible] Joey, wait a second. Joey, wait! Joey! What are you doing here? How were you able to get in? I have two thousand here. For your Mother David's medicine. Go easy. Didn't you say that you need money? Here, get it. Aren't you joking, Sir Dado? No. I'm giving this to you. You will lend me money? I'll give this, Bessie. If you're going to agree with what I want. You're an animal, Sir Dado! Animal! Oh my. You know, with your actions and gimmicks, it puzzles me a lot. Can you tell me first who you really are? Like, where do you study, where do you work, where do you live, and where's your province? All that you can see, and will see, is what's going to tell you what am I and who am I. But the thing is, I'm quite weird. I'm like a kid when I'm sweet. And sometimes, I'm like a demon when I get mad. I like girls, beautiful girls like you. I'm a car addict. I'm fashionable. I'm into classy places like this. I'm adventurous. I'm an addict in gambling. Even my life, I gamble. You're not drunk yet, and you're like that already. What more if you're loaded. That's better if I'm loaded. My words become sweeter. You'll see. Hi. Auntie. Dad just fell asleep. It's sad that we weren't able to talk to him. His heartbeat still varies. Here it is. I got it. Sir Karning, faster! Oh, push. Faster! Hello! How did you know my place? Are we going to talk here? Come in, come in. I'm sorry? I'm about to take a shower. I didn't know you're coming. Is this flat yours, Sir? No, I'm just renting. You want anything? Coke? Beer? No, thanks. I just finished. So, what are we going to do? Up to you? Let's go upstairs. Oh, it's your bedroom, Sir. I thought we're going to your study room. This apartment has no study room. The basic operation of every computer is just the same. Here, look at it. If I'm not wrong, you have a mole in the cheeks, right? What's that? Did it fall and go there? By the way, Eleanor, how's your new work? Thank you for your recommendation, Vic. Because of you, I got in an agency easily. Can you and Kristy visit me some time? I'll cook for you. Sure! I know you're good at cooking. And it's delicious. By the way, Auntie Eleanor, how's your new place? Oh, I'd loved it. Why don't you spend a night with me one of these days? - Yeah, why not? - Right? Is it okay, Dad? Yes, sure. One time, Auntie, I'll sleep there okay? I have so many exciting things to tell you. Yeah, sure. You're always welcome in my place. That's it! I told you. It's easy, right? It's really easy. I told you, you can make it. Now, I won't get a failing grade. You're really great, Sir. You're amazing. Sir? I just realized that you're hairy. You got a lot of chest hair. Isn't that ticklish? Not really. Sir, can I touch you? Sure. Oh. It's ticklish, Sir. It's so thick. You're also hairy. Can I? Sure. I'll touch you, okay? Oh! Sir, it's tickling me. I'm just touching your arms, and you're already tickled. But, Sir, I get tickled easily. How about your neck, do you also get tickled there? What more in my neck. Oh? Yes. Really? Yes. Can I check? Okay? I'm not yet there. Oh. Try to control it. - Slowly, Sir, okay? - Okay. Just control it. Sir? Sir, sorry okay? Thank you for the lesson. I'll go home. It's late already. Hi! I knew you were coming, that's why I waited here. And my golly wow. I'm really not used to your look. I almost didn't recognize you? By the way, I brought Mother David's medicine. Is this it? Nice. How is he? Good news. You can talk to your Mother David now. And you know what? He was looking for you first thing. By the way, for you. And I hope he'll allow you to accompany me, in my invitation. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh okay, go inside and he's waiting for you. My god! Alright! How are you, Mother David? Bessie, my daughter. Don't cry anymore. That might affect you. How's your studies? It's okay. I'm not disregarding it. How's your tuition fee? I asked them. They let me pass a promissory note first. We're going to pay a big amount here, Bessy. The medicine that's only mine, Bessy. Don't think about it, Mother David. We'll get by. God has mercy. The doctor is respectful, kind, light aura. It's not inappropriate, my daughter. You'll let me? I hope the both of you will get along. I hope you'll like him too. I like him, Mother David. It's true that first dates are the hardest. I'm sorry, Ronald, if I'm a lousy company. I told you that when we'll have dinner. Well, in your Mother David's condition, I didn't expect you to be lively. Thank you for understanding. Can I be frank with you, Bessy? I know this is too soon, but I'll tell you anway. I like you, Bessy. You know when we were eating earlier, I didn't do anything but to stare at you. Study you. I'm in love with you, Bessy. I like you too, but we need to wait until my problems are resolved. I love you too, Ronald! You're a motherfucker, Monty! What do you think of our game? Just fooling around? No! You owe me thirty thousand. You're always using that style. Bro, don't embarrass me. I'll pay you. You know, Monty, you've been pissing me off for a long time. Okay, I'll make you do something. And if you're able to do it, we're even. Rise and Rollet. We each pull the trigger once. And if it didn't shoot, we're even. Joey, don't be a fool! Don't mind this, Kristy! Go ahead, get it. I can't do it, Joey. Have mercy. Do it. I won't pull it for you. Do it. Look at me. Now, it's your turn. Joey, don't! Don't do it! You're going to be a mermaid there in the Jacuzzi. And you'll dive onto me down there. And I'll dive onto you like a merman. Oh, you're not wearing an underwear? Giggles. Why would I? That's just a disturbance. What you see is what you get. It's showtime. Joey. Joey. Joey, I'll die. Please, Joey, I'll die due to getting tickled. Joey. Hurry up, girls! Hurry up! You still have a class to catch. And Barbara, no bathing in the nude. I know you, no bathing in the nude. They think they're someone. They're all flirts. But their vaginas are small. Then I said, " Sir, can I touch your chest?" He said, "Why not?" So what I did, I touched his chest. Kristy, Bessy? His pubic hair in his chest is so thick. What pubic hair? Just hair! Stupid! It's the same! I said, "Of course, I also get tickled in my neck." What he did is, he kissed my ears. I got wet in my underwear. Then, he kissed my lips. Oh my! I got really wet. Then… slowly he layed me down. Then when I felt him going over me, Then, then… Then what? What happened? I stood up and ran. Bullshit! So nothing happened? But how? I have no plans in giving my virginity. I'm still not ready. You're still not ready? How about you, what's your story? A lot. But of course, I won't tell it. All I can say is, I saw the man equivalent to me. The man who's going to have me. Like a torro, girl! He is one big torro! How about you, Bessie? What's your story? Nothing, Ronald and I had dinner. He's kind. You don't have something? No. Oh, no bathing in the nude, Barbara. Yes, Sister. Look at what Sister is doing. Look at it. I'm annoyed with that Sister. I'll go nude. Why? Is there anyone showering wearing a sando? Barbara! Don't you remember what I told you? Put on your panty! Sister. You're really stubborn? Put on your panty! Let's go. Come on, Kristy. You deserve that. Bye girls! Oh, what? Let's go. Mother David is waiting for you. Visit him, please? How's he? In God's mercy, he's okay. But he needs to be careful to avoid complication. Tell him we're going to visit him. Tell Mother David that we'll-- What? Why are you getting us wet? Why? Did you get wet? Then take a shower again so that it won't smell in the class later. You shit! You think you smell pleasant? If I know, you have bad odour! No one will stop them, okay? Come here! You know, I've just been holding back my temper! What? Are you going to fight back? Fight back! Go! Fight back! No one will interrupt them, okay? You? You! No one will interrupt them, okay? Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Kristy, what's the meaning of this? Sister, she's the one who's always provoking a fight. Why? You're the one who's always starting it? Oh really, you're going to get away from this? Sister? Sister? You stop! You stop! Sir, wait! Yes, Ms. Asid? Why are you ignoring me? I was raising my hand earlier, yet you didn't call me. I studied the lesson well. Are you mad? I'm not mad at you, Angie. Oh okay, if you're not mad, let's have dinner. Okay? No. I know you're mad, because of last night. Yes because of last night. It's wrong! What's wrong? Your answer in the exam is wrong. Don't push it. If you want, I'll recheck your papers. What-- Is that okay? What papers? What recheck? You're so vague! Angie, this is not the place to talk about it. They're all staring at us. Sister. Sister is listening. When? Where? Sir! When? Where is our dinner? Paging Doctor Ronald De Lara, please proceed to the OR immediately. Paging Doctor De Lara, please proceed to the OR immediately. Doctor De Lara, you are needed in the OR right now. Mother David needs to undergo operation within 24 hours. What's the problem? Money? Yes, Kristy. I have money here. I'll give it to you, It's two thousand five hundred. I'm ashamed, Kristy, but I need fifteen thousand. Oh, no. I don't have that. I just bought a painting one day ago. Angie also got nothing, right? I know already. I'll sell one of my paintings. Oh my, that's too much of you Kristy. But I don't have anyone to ask. Oh, that's nothing. Here, I'll call a buyer I know. If I'll be able to sell the painting, you're all good. Wait, okay? Bessy, I'm sorry okay? My prospective buyer has no cash too. You know, if only I have money, that's not a problem. Bessy, how's your Mother David? I heard it will take long for him to get out of the hospital. Yes. That's a big expense, and I heard you're also unable to pay your rent for three months. Wait a second. How did you know all of that? What's your concern? I'm your friend, Bessy. We're neighbors, right? I'll be able to help you. I know where you can get a big amount of money. Oh? Yes. You know, in this work… at first, it's difficult. It's hard deep inside. When you get used to it, nothing, you'll be numb. Think of it. You're enjoying, and you also earn a lot. Not just money. A lot of money that college graduates can't earn. That's five thousand. 18? 19? First time? You smell like a baby. I want to see what you got. Do you mind? Have mercy. I can't do it anymore. Have mercy. That's enough. That's enough! I'll help you. I got you. Light? Hi, Gary! Where did you hide? Why can't I see you? Why? Does my type always stay in one place? I thought an insect is stopping you. Rupert, please? Change the topic. Okay, I'll tell you something. What? It's noisy. I'll just whisper it to you so that you'll hear it. - Oh, what is it? What did you do? Rupert, my head is hot! Oh, come on. What's new? Kristy, oh, why? Have you proven anything? Joey, why are you punching them? They're my friends. But I saw him disrespecting you. Joey. Joey? Joey, what are you doing? That's enough. Stop it. Stop it! Joey! I don't want it anymore! - You're going to fall. Up to you. - Joey, don't touch me. - Let's go. - Joey. - Come with me. Come with me. What are you doing? - Let's go. - Why are you pulling me? - Come here! - Joey, I'm getting hurt! What are you doing? You're hitting me. Joey, let me go. Joey! Put me down, Joey! What are you doing? Put me down! I just went off for a week, then you're already going wild in the disco? Why, are you replacing me with that fool? Forget? Is it that easy to forget me? Yes, why? Who are you to be remembered? Is it that easy to forget about me? You're an animal! What are you doing, Joey? Jo- Joey, what are you doing? What are you doing, Joey? You're an animal, Joey. You're the most of all the animals! Joey. Joey. Joey not here. Not here. Here, Joey? Someone might see us. No one. Leave it to me. I want to talk to you. Angie, go home. You don't know what you're saying. I know, Serge. One hundred percent, I know. Now, the next move is yours. Take it off. Serge, don't-- don't hurt me. Serge, don't -- please. You and I is one. Bye. I love you, Serge. I love you. Who's that? - Who are you? - Where's Angie? Come here! - You shameless woman! - Dad? Sir, Sir. Don't interfere! - Dad? - Come here. Here. Go in. Go in. Dad? Serge? Sir Manlapas was fired. Really. Admit it, Angie is really a flirt. Who's flirt? What do you want? I'll punch you again? Now what, you want? You're nothing. Hi, Serge. It's you. Come in. You're leaving? Yes. Serge, I'll come with you. I won't go back there. I'll come with you. I don't have anywhere to go. Serge, I need you. Angie, I was kicked out of school because of you. I don't want to complicate things more. Who are you? I'm Kristy. I'm the nephew of Auntie Eleanor, is she there? Come in. Okay, thank you. She's upstairs. Wait a second. I'll call her through intercom. No need, I'll surprise her. Oh, Ma'am. Ma'am, wait a second, Ma'am. What is the meaning of this? Kristy, let me explain! Explain? It's as bright as the sun. Shit! I can't trust anyone from you. My Mom. You, Dad! And also you, Auntie Eleanor. You're all crazy. Crazy! Kristy, wait! Let it be. Let her. Grandpa, I'm so confused. I'm really confused. My girl, since you're in the right age, I will tell you something. It's important for you to know this. Your Mom and your Auntie Eleanor are not really sisters. Marita is just adopted. Adopted? Grandpa, how did that happen? But, God has blessed us with Eleanor in our sixth year. They grew up being equally loved. And to avoid being embarrassed, Vicente, my accountant, we forced them. They got together to give you name. It's late when I found out that Vicente loves Eleanor. And Eleanor loves him. If that's the case, I'm not a real Raymundo? Who am I? What's this? Why is this burnt? Serge, I'm sorry. I'm sorry because the iron. Sorry? Don't you know this is my favorite polo? Would you burn all my polos? - Oh, dude, the one looks like you. - That looks like you? Oh, bro. Bro. I saw you sometimes. Tell us the truth, right Tom? No, bro. Look if I'm the guy. Bro, it seems like you. Hey, the doorbell. It's them. Bro? Bro! Hey! What are you doing? You're taking too long. The one we're waiting arrived. Better get ready boys? Cause nobody's going home tonight. You heard it. Lori. Come in! I thought you won't be coming. Okay boys. I'd like you to meet Lori. Hi. And… Shirley. And Shirley. I'd like you to meet this horny guys, they are Johny, Mike, - Hello. - And Rolly. And I'm Butch. I'm the horniest. And they're your sisters in business. Lea, Naneth, and Cathy. Hi. And Ronald. Hi. Oh, bro, you took her first! She's beside you already. You're too slow. Well guys. Ronald, wait. You're two-faced? Is this your other face at night when you're working? How much are you being paid to be a prostitute? Three? Four? Five thousand? Ronald, wait! Is this what you need? How much do you need? Here money! Here… money! It's all yours! Don't fool people again. Don't fool people like me. Why did I court you? Why didn't I just pay you? And fuck you! I'm sorry, Ronald. Sorry? Why? Do prostitutes know how to say sorry? Bessy, this is painful. This is painful, Bessie. Where are you going? I'll go home, Ronald. No! You're already paid. Work for that Five Thousand. Ronald, no! You made me look like a fool. Why are you punishing me this way, Ronald? This is too much! Because you fooled me. Shit! Shit! All of my life, I thought I was sure of myself. Of who I was. Of where I was standing. Of where I was leaning. Raymundo's bloodline. Rich bloodline. Bullshit! I was so boastful. But the truth is, I'm just left by a bad air. Where will I find my true father? Where is he? Where he lives? What's his surname? What's my surname? Don't think of it too much, Kristy. Don't worry, we'll look for a surname. Kristy? Kristy Onasis. That sounds rich? Kristy Laufer. Kristy Taylor. Kristy Piper. Or, Kristy Pata. Angie, this is not the time for your gimmicks, okay? It's not funny. But, that's my only sense in this friendship, right? That's the only thing I'm good at. I'm sorry, okay? I'm just excited to see you girls. And it's been a long time since I made a joke. Only this time again. Kristy, Bessy, Serge does not love me anymore. He's always scolding at me. He's always hot-headed. Specially when his computer was brought to the pawn shop. Because he doesn't have a job. Me, I'm really trying my best. But, he's always seeing wrong things in what I do at home. Because, because… Because you're stupid. That, that's what I always hear from him… Stupid! Fuck it! Your problems are nothing compared to mine. Bessy, why? What's your problem? I've been a prostitute. What did you say? I've been a prostitute! I've been a prostitute, Angie… Kristy. - Hey. - What's that, Serge? Where's my socks? I'm just new to my job, I'm already late. Oh, it's in the closet? Will I look for it if it's there? I was looking for it a long time now. It's not there. Oh, you're holding it. Are you fooling me? Stupid! This is just one. I'm looking for its pair. If you're not so stupid, I already told you all the socks should be paired. All the items that is needed together, to place it together. Crazy! You're burning the one you're cooking! Oh, you're right. Oh, oh, ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Serge, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Stupid! Fuck you! My parents didn't hurt me all my life. You were the first one to hurt me, animal! I did everything to serve you. I even chose you over my future! Because I thought, you were the only one who understands me. I've been a slave for you! All the things you want, I did. But all of it are failed. All are wrong! I haven't done anything you appreciated! But is there a time you heard something from me? None! Because I love you. Because I induced it all. But fuck that love. Stupid you! Now what? Why aren't you talking? Speak! You're still the stupidiest of all! Just tell me if you don't want me. - I don't want you! - I don't want you too! I was wrong with you, animal! What's your car doing there? It's blocking the way. You're an animal! It's you! You're an animal! Why are you showing only now? I've been looking for you everywhere, you didn't even got the ball to show up. - Even just a call, you didn't do. You didn't do anything! - That's enough. Kristy. What? I don't like you anymore! Don't show up again, you're disgusting. What? Come on. What? - No! - Just a sec. I don't want! I don't want! I can pay the money I owe you, Monty. Good. If not, you'll be salvaged. You almost missed your due. Kristy, I'll have this ring first. I'll just use it to pay, Monty. I owe him money. Please, Kristy, this is our agreement. What car? When did this guy got his own car? The cars he is using are only rented. Why? Did he tell you it's his? What? Why? I thought… wait, how much does he owe you? Can this ring pay it? That's not enough. Now, if you're included… you even have a change, Joey boy. - Fuck you, Monty, not her-- - You're washed out. You're already washed out, Bro. If you fooled me before, this time it's you I'm fooling. Okay, Monty. I'll come with you. How's that, Joey boy. Your girlfriend is also mine? What? Just stay there, okay? The first time I saw her, I was already hot about her. It's okay that you leave that uncircumcised man. Bro, wait. Let's go! Kristy? Joey! Stand up. I can't. Stand up. I can't stand up. You can do it. You can-- Joey! Joey, don't leave me! Joey! I'll come back to you. Go back here. Joey! Joey! How are you, Bessy? I'm okay, Mother David. What is happening to your studies? I'm continously studying, Mother David. Even if we're facing problems, I'm assuring that I won't skip school. I actually passed all my exams today. Not only that, Mother David, I'm also part of the top in our class. About my personal life, Mother David. Something happened, Mother David. Mother David, something happened. Mother David, what will happen to me, Mother David? What will? Bessie? How about me? - Bessie? - What will happen to me, Mother David? What will happen to me? Why? Why did you do that? That's the only… that's the only way to save your life. Wrong. That's wrong, my daughter. That's not right. I don't have to live if your future will suffer. No, Mother David. If there's anything lost, if there's anything broken, that's not important. Because you are important to me. You just got me somewhere. Even if we're not related. You gave your life to me. That's why I'll also give my life to you. My daughter, how about your dream? How about your future with Ronald? Ronald is not a loss, if you're the one who is the replacement. I'm begging you, Mother David. Help yourself to live. Give essence to everything I do-- Mother David. Here's your bill. I also included that one you took out. The food here is delicious. It's also affordable. Is this restaurant operating for a long time? It's just turning one month. I'm just lucky there's a lot of people going to the office. Just like-- I'm happy in this small eatery Kristy and I have. She lend me a capital from the money she inherited from her late grandfather… Grandpa Ordemyo. In this eatery, I learned a lot of things. That I didn’t learn at home and at school. Now I can call myself a complete woman. Now I know a lot of things about life. Now, how will you make me go back to the big house? I don't like my life there. I'll stay here. Because it's quiet and I am happy here. The father of your baby, what happened to him? He didn't know I was pregnant. I'll raise this kid well. My baby does not need a father. My baby does not need Serge. Digna, please fix the new paintings, it'll be brought today. - Yes, Ma'am. - The Cheque. Ma'am, someone wants to hand this over to you. Some guy. - What's this? - Here. And who's the guy? He left already. He didn't say who he is. I'll check him outside. Oh sure. I took care of that ring because I know that one day I'll give it back to you. Thank you. For that, to give you back the ring. And also, to ask for forgiveness. I was gone because I went to Japan. I put up a business there. I just hope you can give me another-- Joey, that's enough. Don't continue. I erased all that. And you. I also forgot about you. Ouch. It's a great experience to know you. Because of you, I learned to love and to get hurt. And for the next chapter of my life, I learn to be safe and to make sure of the man I will love. I'm done with you. You're done with me. Right? But I'm not the Joey you used to know, I'm different now. I've also changed, Joey. I'm done with the let-it-be kind of life. I'm done with that life. Good bye, Joey. And good luck. Such a waste. You know, Kristy, I'm always attending the mass every Sunday. I also read the bible every night. I've changed. Good bye, Joey. Okay, bye. Are you asking for my forgiveness? To the both of you, Mother David. Specially to you, Bessie. I've been narrow minded. My understanding. I pretended to be clean. Then I realised, I'm the dirtiest of all the dirtiest. In all I've done, Bessie, I'm sorry. There's already doubts between the two of us, Ronald. A lot of thing has changed, too. It's hard to bring it back. Let us give this to the right moment. If what should really happen. Tomorrow. Merry Mercado. Gina Paredes. Arlene Angeles. Nisa Francisco. Elizabeth Montano. Bessie, congrats! You made it!
