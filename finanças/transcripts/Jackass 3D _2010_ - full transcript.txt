Ging is spelled G-i-n-g. Oh, so Nigg is an anagram! My guess is that when I was a baby, I came here with Ging. He was probably trying to tell me this: If I'm ready to give up everything to find him, I have to get strong enough to clear the game... Well? What will you do once you find Ging? Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua! My best friend in the world! Accompany on! Nigg! Reunion x And x Understanding Is that Gon's... G-Ging... I got a slot machine in my mouth! It goes from 1 to 9. Each number summons a different weapon. This is my Crazy Slots! Crazy Slots: Psychotic Clown Give me something good... 4! Damn, bad roll. Shut up! You should be grateful, you idiot! An ant? Are you hurt? Is that Ging? That isn't Ging... Hey... What was that about? First you push us down, then you fire at us! Enough fooling around! Fooling around? I was being dead serious. If I hadn't opened fire, you would have been attacked. By what?! The ant you shot? Ow! What is this? Idiot! That's no ordinary ant. It's a Chimera Ant. A Chimera Ant? An aggressive, carnivorous insect, currently under class-1 quarantine. From time to time, they even attack humans. You were standing right in front of their nest. Had I not fired, a Chimera Ant army would have consumed you by now. I feel like this has happened before... Don't worry, it's not serious. Apply this. It's an antibiotic. What? That's it? Let's go nuts, man! Shut up... Go away. You should leave, as well. Damn... Because of this interruption, I'll need to start over. But the nest was destroyed. Man, forced to take another life... Ah! Man, forced to take another life... Are you... Are you the one who saved me back then? Back then? On Whale Island, after I stumbled into the territory of a Foxbear with its cub. Whale Island? That time, too, you had to kill, in order to protect me. Oh, yes. I remember now. I never expected to run into you again here. You've grown, Gon. How do you know my name? I heard it from your dad, Ging-san. Old man, you know Ging? Old... Yeah, my name is Kite. Ging-san was my master. Oh, so you're also pro Hunters? Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san? Call me Kite. It's awkward being addressed formally by my master's son. Okay. Then, you're one too, Kite? Yeah, Ging-san was the one who made me a top-class Hunter. He was my teacher and benefactor. If I hadn't met Ging-san, I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum. Wait up! Damned brat! He swiped the bread that I'd managed to find... He isn't escaping today. My bread! Bastard, you won't get away today! Ow! What is this? What are you doing? Stop it... You live with these guys? That sounds fun. That was how you met Ging? Yeah... Ging-san said that good Hunters are well-liked by animals. He said I had potential, so I got interested. And you became his student? I had to force him to teach me. He hated dealing with any kind of hassle... So I was never his student officially. But I was a stubborn one... I kept bugging him. Eventually, I started to develop my Nen, and he began teaching me to hunt. As a result, I was able to pass the Hunter Exam with little difficulty. But before Ging-san was satisfied, I had to clear another hurdle. Can you guess what it was? I think I might know. Oh? No, I definitely know. This is what Ging would have said... "Try to catch me." Exactly. You're right. I knew it! I figured that was it! But as far as I knew, he was the world's greatest Hunter. It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever. There were no clues or leads to begin from. And I didn't hear word of a single sighting. He'd managed to completely erase his existence from this world. Like a super-powered form of Zetsu? So... So what happened in the end? I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue, so I went to his home. To Whale Island. That was when I met you, Gon. But back then, I didn't realize that you were Ging-san's son. I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san and told him about what had happened on Whale Island. That was my kid... His name is Gon. Thanks for hitting him. It's common sense to avoid Foxbear territory when they're raising young. Ging-san wasn't surprised that I went to Whale Island, or that I met you there. It was almost as though he'd expected it. Looking back, it may be that everything's gone according to Ging-san's plans. Are you saying he set all this up? Well, I can't prove it. You might be right. Razor was waiting for me. And Dwun and List. Razor? Dwun? Yeah, in a game called Greed Island... It's a long story. In the game, a guy named Razor was waiting for me, at Ging's request. My son will come here one day. When that happens, give him a good beating. Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him? Don't get too cocky. He is my son. Then, I'm counting on you, Razor. Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends who helped him create Greed Island. Oh, Razor was also one of them... Anyway, those three were waiting for me. When I learned that, I realized something. If Ging planned for me to go to Greed Island and meet his friends, meeting Bisky and the others may have been another part of his plan. In that case, it's possible that Ging also planned that you'd meet Kite here. Huh? Oh, that's right! You must have been to Greed Island before. Me? Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"? Nigg? No, I don't recall that name. Wait... I do remember Ging-san taking me inside a game... I knew it! Greed Island... Yes, I believe that was its title. But I can't remember if I used an alias. That must be it... Ging must have had you use the name Nigg. Damn! He tricked me! You were so sure you'd meet him, huh? Are you sure this was the right decision, Ging? Can you make it so that using Magnetic Force will send Gon to me, while using Accompany will send him to Kite? I can... Why do you want me to do that? If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on his own, I'm willing to meet with him. But I can't meet him if he's so gutless that he has to bring friends. Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless? I don't understand. Never mind... Just do it! You'd probably just be embarrassed if he brought a crowd. Shut up! Just do it! He's so weird... Shy and stubborn. I feel sorry for Gon-kun. I understand. So the game Greed Island was created to train you boys. Only Gon, really. I just tagged along for the ride. That may have been part of Ging's plan, too. Even me? Nah, that's impossible. However, it appears that our meeting here wasn't coincidence. Yeah, I agree. There must be a deeper meaning to this. Meaning? Razor waited inside the game to make you stronger, so one would think Ging must have some role for Kite to play. A role... Your final test was finding Ging, right? Yeah. That sounds like a daunting task. The best Hunters in this world are masters of not only hunting, but concealing themselves as well. Yet you were able to find him. Oh... Yeah, that's true. Once you cleared your final test, Ging must have decided you were worthy of handling this. Handling this? Handling what? Handling what? Basically... Thanks for hitting him. Say, Gon... Want me to tell you Ging-san's current whereabouts? No, I'll find him on my own. A good response. Anyway, tell me about Ging. Tell me everything you know! How to help two-headed wolves breed? Ging is involved in that stuff? Sure, Ging-san is involved with a wide range of Hunter activities. He's never formally applied because he doesn't want to expend the energy, but he's as qualified as a Triple Star Hunter. Triple Star? Stars are awarded to Hunters who perform extraordinary tasks. Those responsible for historical discoveries or global achievements receive three stars. There are fewer than ten of these Hunters in the world. The title "Triple Star Hunter" is reserved for the very best. So Ging is as good as the best! Kite... A Hunter who earned Ging's respect. Ging-san is also famous for discovering the Lurka Ruins and the Kongo gold vein. Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins! Kite, student of Ging... While his meeting with Gon and Killua signaled the beginning of a new adventure... On the Yorbian continent, in the southernmost of the Balsa Islands, a prologue to unparalleled fear was quietly but steadily unfolding. Not enough. These creatures are not enough, no matter how many I eat. But I cannot move... Stay calm. Focus on recovering my energy. I must heal before I can take the next step. I have a duty to fulfill... I must give birth to the King! I am the Queen! Next time: Unease x And x Sighting. Are you uneasy, Killua? D-Don't embarrass me!
