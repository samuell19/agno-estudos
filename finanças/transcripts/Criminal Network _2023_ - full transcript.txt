We've been watching you. Who are you? The police? Would you prefer to speak with them? I'm sure Scotland Yard will be more than willing to accommodate you. Well then, I suppose you are stuck with us. I wanna see him. The emergency services were too late. Ryan is no longer with us. He was too far gone when we arrived. Please take all the time you need, but we do need to know everything that happened from the beginning. Well, I guess it all goes back to two years ago. [clock ticking] [Simmons] This past year has been great, Ryan, huh? Safe to say, you've restored my faith in teaching. You remind me a lot of myself, really. We're the same, you and me. You like to play, and you play to win. That's all there is, you know. That's what business is, really. It's a game. [soft relaxing music playing] Too bad a degree won't help me. [Simmons chuckles] You can't rely on yourself more than a degree, Ryan. I mean, your grades are the best I've seen in a long time. And you've made so much more money, so I hear. Don't believe everything you hear. Well, there's so much more I would like to offer you. I would like to make you an offer. You get your degree, and in two years, I'd like to offer you a special internship in one of my businesses. First, get your degree. And then, we'll see how we get on together. What do you say? No. Last investment I made fell through. I lost everything. Can't afford the tuition fees anymore, so I'm no longer a student here. Goodbye, Professor. Ryan. Ryan! [music fades] So, how did it go then? Oh, man. How did you lose it all overnight? [exhaling loudly] What are you gonna do now? Are you gonna get a loan? "We regret to inform you your loan application has been denied." Have you got any friends that can lend you the money? You are the closest thing I've got to a friend, and I don't even like you. Well, there's gotta be something you can do. What about Professor Simmons? No chance. All available funding has already been taken. No one can help me. [gun clicking] [footsteps crunching] [Cormac] You're late. Doesn't look like I've missed much. Where is he? He won't be coming today. In that case, you can tell him we'll reschedule. And next time, please don't waste my time. [Cormac] You said you wanted out. -He'd like to buy it from you. -Seriously? This isn't another one of his stupid jokes -he likes to play, is it? -No. You held up your end, as you keep saying. So, he is willing to offer a price. How much? Half the current market value. Half. Why would I settle for half when I could get the full amount selling it as a pub? You don't reckon the price would be affected if people knew what this place was used for? Don't even pretend you'll let it slip because you'll be the ones that end up in prison. Still playing the innocent card, are we? You knew what this place was to be used for, and yet you chose to ignore it. I didn't see anything. It's amazing what people don't see -when there's money involved. -Look, I'm not stupid. I know how much he's made here and what he can afford. The vans that keep coming in in the early hours of the morning? I didn't have to keep this place closed, you know. You owe me. You're right. Without you, we wouldn't have all what we have here today. So, you'll tell him I want the full asking price. Otherwise, I'm selling this place to someone else, and you guys can pack your bags. [pensive music playing] [James] You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about how I've changed, especially since graduating. I thought I'd go on to do great things, but... it's been two years since I've seen my brother now. Well, with how I left things, I don't know what sort of trouble he's in. I wish I could take it back. I just didn't care at the time. I wanted to live my life to the fullest. Just wish I could say sorry. But it doesn't look like that's gonna happen, though. Anyway, time's up. Back to work. It's good talking to you. [paper wrapping scuffling] [phone chimes] [train chugging] [pensive music continues] ♪ [indistinct announcement over speakers] [James] Got to admit, I was surprised when you text me. I thought-- You thought what? I was expecting the worst, you know? Well, you're not far wrong. Well, it's nice to know you're not laying in the gutter somewhere, at least. Been there, done that. Ryan, come on. Can't be that bad, surely. So, you said something about needing my help. -What was it? -My job. At the moment, I've been doing it myself, but... things are... different, and... now I'm not too sure. Okay. Doing what? I can't really tell you. I'd have to show you. Whatever you need. Where is it? I don't know yet. Okay. When is it? I don't know. You don't know much about this job, do you? Are you sure you got a job? I have to wait for a text. It's all right. I was, uh, I'm a bit short of money lately. I was thinking maybe I could stay at your place. I-- I could take the sofa, if that's all right with you. -Whatever. -[James] Oh, yeah. And, uh, I didn't forget, I just didn't know where to send it. I got you, uh, a birthday present for last week. Look, I called you here because I need help with my job. That's it. I don't wanna know anything about your personal life. I don't wanna play happy families. And I certainly don't want any piece of crap you managed to afford for a day that you weren't even around for. ♪ Why does he seem to resent you so much? Well, a few years back, me and Ryan came into some inheritance money. University seemed like a good idea for the both of us. I paid for the fees up front. But Ryan... he paid for the fees in installments and invested his money. Seems awfully risky for someone without any experience. Not entirely. I mean, he grew quite close to one of the professors. They'd talk all the time, play games, do puzzles. Ryan made a ton of money with the professor. And so, you fell out over Ryan's success? Not quite. I borrowed some money from Ryan, where he had so much of it. I didn't think he'd noticed, but when his investments fell through, he found out and he's resented me for it ever since. [cars honking] [James] So, what's there to do in London while we wait for this text? There's a natural history museum. Uh, pass on the skeletons if that's all right with you, -while I'm eating my lunch. -I don't know. I quite like looking at the prehistoric human skulls. Hobby? Envy. Well, I wouldn't envy them too much. They're dead. Yeah. But think about how they died. Not hooked up to machinery with the thought of death lingering in their mind. No, they died in the heat of conflict. Adrenaline rushing through their body. I'll take that over a hospital bed any day. Yeah. Don't get too excited. I only rent the top floor, but there is a spare room. [bed creaks] [sentimental piano music] [phone chimes] [James] Are you sure you got the right place? That's the point, I suppose. It's right where no one would think to look. But we can't go in yet. Not until everybody's left. So, how exactly is this earning you money? [Ryan] We'll find out. Look, if you're gonna steal something-- I'm not stealing anything. Unlike you, I don't take things that aren't mine. You're still bringing that up? If I still had that money, I could've carried on. But then you would've lost even more. [Ryan] So, that makes it yours, does it? -Is that what you're saying? -Well, no. I'm not saying that. I wouldn't have dropped out. That money would've kept me going for at least another six months. Look, what do you want me to do? I've said I'm sorry. Like, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I've spent the money. If I had it, I'd give it to you. What do you want me to do? [Ryan] Well, you can start by keeping a lookout while I go in. Ryan, it's been two years. After all this time, I'm the only person you can call? You're still isolating yourself. You got no friends. What are you, a psychiatrist? I had hoped something would've changed, I suppose.

It all started a while back when I was homeless. I stayed in Central for a while. 'Til I was moved on. I ended up stealing a car.

I'm not sure who they were. They took me to this place. I don't know where it was. They gave me a phone. I was told to await instructions, and I'd be paid each time I did a job with some big payout coming out at the end. So, at nighttime, I'd wait for a message and head out. It did involve just taking photos of warehouses, but more recently, drugs and guns. -All packaged. -So, you don't have any names? No. Do you even know who you're working for? All I get is these texts from a man named Mr. Black, which I'm sure is a fake name. So, you don't have any names, you don't know who you are working for or what you're getting yourself into? No. I don't need to know, and I don't want to know. I'm never going back to how it was. Never. Ryan, this is clearly some sort of organized crime. I haven't done anything illegal. That's not gonna stop the repercussions, though, is it? Look, if you are not happy with this, by all means, I'll keep your half of the money. So, decide right now. Do you want to be a part of this? If you agree, there's no turning back. Okay. Where to next? [cars honking] [James] I don't wanna seem ungrateful, but have you ever thought about maybe moving away and trying something else? [Ryan] You think you can just move away from something like this? Well, I don't think you've tried. [James] And what would you have me do? Nine till five job? Three kids and a mortgage? No, thanks.

You're not serious. We can't do that. Ryan, we need to phone the police. The police were already here. If you wanna talk to them, go ahead. We can try a different police. What good will that do? -Will it bring her back? -[James] Whoever done this, they need to be caught and stopped. That's what we're doing. We're stopping them.

I told you before, there's no turning back. This is my job. I earn good money, why should I give it up? Ryan, there's plenty of other ways to earn money. No. That's all part of the lie. That you can have anything you want in life, all you have to do is work hard. Well, I did everything I was supposed to do. Everything. And it all failed. They lied. They lied to us. You tell me.

[sighs] You could have been part of all of this. As I said, we could have gone far together, Ryan. But, no. No, you just left. You took off. I lost everything, remember? Your advice on investing. If you needed money, then you could have come to me. I would've helped you. But, no. No, no, no. You gave up in the world. You-- you-- It was too hard. You just decided to take it and roll over. It was easier to have your dreams taken away rather than to-- to actually try risking yourself. Easier to blame somebody else, am I right Ryan?

But first, I think we'll have one more little game. No, thank you. Ryan, if you end this phone call, I swear you will regret the day you set foot inside of my university. Goodbye, Professor. -It's Simmons. -Simmons? -Simmons, who? -Simmons, Simmons. As in, Professor Simmons. He's the one behind all this. The drugs, the guns, the distribution, it all belongs to him. That sounds like too much of a coincidence. I don't think any of this happened by a coincidence. He killed that girl. A bullet in the head. My guess is she got mixed up with him somehow and that's how she ended up. -We both need to leave. -Okay. I won't stay in the flat in case there's any problems.

Should you divulge any of the information I'm about to share with you; you'll be swiftly taken to the UK's maximum security prison. Now, Professor Simmons is the remnant of a dying breed. People like this we know about. But due to his extensive criminal network, we've experienced difficulty dealing with him. He has judges, police officers, even secret servicemen under his control. Any attempt to bring him down failed until he became involved with a young woman, a woman, unknown to the professor, the daughter of someone of great importance. -So why didn't you do anything? -We did. But we needed to know exactly what we were dealing with in order to avoid the legal ramifications of an official inquiry, which would've given the professor a distinct advantage. You paid Ryan. You sent him the phone. We needed to find someone close to him and Ryan was selected. Of course, Ryan was unaware of any of this. But we did agree to pay over a sum of money on completion, which I have no issues on passing onto you. Very convenient for you, wasn't it?
