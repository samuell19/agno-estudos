Where should we go now? - What else do you want to do? Aren't you tired yet? - You're a louse if you go to bed now! - I insist we go for women! Who paid the bill? - Let go of my arm! - Come with me, I must talk to you. - Why not tell me here? - You wouldn't like it, right in front of everyone! - Don't you think you made enough a fool of yourself? - I do what I please! - Listen, I might even lose my temper! - I can't wait for it to happen! - I advise you not provoke me, you know? Don't provoke me! - Come and play bowls? Malagu', may we use the radio in your car? I must dance or i'll end up crying with these idiots. - Come on, find a bossa nova! - Find anything! I'll try Radio Montecarlo. - Look! Damn, I can't hit one! - Stay calm! - It's him! It's him who's... See, now you must go near the ball, the small one. - Oh, but I can't! - Oh, it's very easy! You throw... - Oh but I can't! I'll help you, i'll help you, i'll help you, on three, eh? One, two, three! Not bad! - Well! - We won! - What could be done, is the first time you play! - No, no! Stop everybody! I must check. - I told you I'd make you lose if.. - you teamed with me! - What are you saying, We're winning! The bowl is out of measure! - Sorry, Major, but the nearest is that one. - Have we won? - Why sure, Liuli! Who else could have won? There! The radio broke. - I told you, Malagu', that this is a piece of scrap! I seize you! I seize you! I want to sink my teeth in your thighs! They all know he's a sex maniac! Nice, nice... Oh, let me play! Our point, it's our point! - So, what have you decided? - That you're bothering me! Liuli! - But what happened? - Nothing, the same old stories! Your sister with Alberto. - I'll bring a whiskey, do you want? - No, thank you. - Believe me Liuli, he's no man for you. He went... - I'm going home Liuli. Take my jacket, you're shivering, you'll get ill. Bye! I'll see you! Are you still up? Unhook me will you. I've never been so bored in my life as I was tonight. Why don't you get an icepack? You know how your face burns up when you've been out all night. It's probably Alberto. He's already phoned you twice tonight. Hello Now what? I told you I was sorry. Now you listen to me, you don't have the right... you don't have the right to treat me like that in front of everyone. I didn't make eyes at... Just a minute. I do not belong to you, get that into your head. T-T-Telephone. T-T-Telephone. Alright, alright. - Who is it? - Your c-c-cousin. At this hour? Once again we come to the end of another edition of 'Wake up with music'. I hope you will be with us again tomorrow. Antonietta, must you have the blinds up so early in the morning? What do you want? What? But Fred... What little jaunt? It was supposed to be this morning. No, i'm afraid not. Some other time. - You're not the only one in the house you know. - I know. I happen to be waiting for a call. Alright, i'm coming with you. Yes I know, at the hill, ciao. Hey, what are you doing, daydreaming? - We've been waiting for her for an hour. - Come on let's go. Come on, faster. Hey, my turn next, alright? Are you kidding? You wouldn't be able to, it's very hard. And if you don't know how you might even break the skis. Well if I don't try how am I supposed to learn? What a dope you are. I bet you bought those skis just for Sergia. You know Sergia's really good, I never would have thought it. Go on Sergia, get a little fancy, hold on. Very good, let's see how fast you can take it. Let me steer a little. Let me steer. Careful. Come on stop it, you'll make her lose her balance. Are you crazy? Slow down. Slow down, slow down! - You haven't seen anything yet. - What do you mean? Hey, rocks! Rocks ahead. Hey. Listen up, get out of the way. Idiots! Sergia. - Where's Sergia? - Who knows, disappeared. - She wasn't with you? - No. Catch anything? - I saw one as big as this... - And you missed it. That's right, don't help Mark, you might work up a sweat. Dumb Sergia, didn't even think of bringing something to eat. I have an idea she's out somewhere getting the sun without any clothes on. Sure Mark, dream on. Didn't you ever notice that Sergia doesn't have any... white areas here and here, she's all tanned. And her sister too. Last summer they used to go sailing together... and when they were out of sight... tick, tock! Two girls without a stitch on, what a pretty picture that makes. - You sure they had nothing on? - I know it. Well come on, you can at least carry the skis, no? What if Sergia wants to go for another ride? I'll leave them here. I went to look at the house. - Anyone there? - No, there was no-one. You think she believed that story about it being my uncle's house? Come on, let's get there before she shows up. If she sees we don't have keys she won't believe it. But how will we get in without keys? Look, i've thought about nothing else but this project for a whole month. You don't think i'm going to give it all up for a lousy key? Alright but what if the owner shows up? What an optimist you are! The odds are he won't show up. Come on. Maybe he won't but... Supposing he does, what then? Look, if it will make you stop worrying, i'll let you go first with Sergia. You'll let me go first?! That is funny, Mark, you don't have a clue about Sergia. I know what i'll do, i'll climb in through the hatch. Charge! I already tried to see me.??? So you must be the first that gives this sentence to he that suffers. Oh it is excellent to have a giant strength. - Do you hear that? Here she comes. - Well get in there and open the door. ...As Job himslef does, Job would ne'er be quiet... So every helping petty officer would... use his heaven for thunder, nothing but thunder. Freddy? Mark? Mark? Come on out. Come on out, I know you're in there, come out. Idiots! Hey Freddy come on. Let me go. Hold her legs. Don't let her go. Are you crazy? You almost bit my arm off. Well she knocked the breath out of me with that kick. Liars, liars, liars... You've got some nerve calling this a villa, it's more like a shack. Yes, but there's enought to eat for a month... and there's a cellar full of wine and upstairs... No no, don't tell me anymore, I want to discover everything for myself. - Nothing. - Go upstairs and see how nice it is. You poor little puppy, i'll bite you again if you don't look out. Where were you all this time? Ask your friend Mark. What a beautiful place. Hey, friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears... Now, listen i've news to tell you. Tonight Sergia's going to stay right here, right up in that room. Sergia adores the shack. Anyway, my sister won't even notice that i'm gone... My father's away on one of his lecture tours... And our maid can stay at home and stutter all by herself. Look, you two don't have to stay if you don't want to... If you have things to do, take off, just come back and get me tomorrow. Look at him. You should see the look on your face. What's the matter with this maniac? It was my idea to spend a weekend in the first place. Oh well, shall we get moving? Where do you want to go? We're fine right here. Be quiet. If we were any quiter sweetheart we'd be dead. Oh Mark, what a bullet you are. Come on you two, let's hoist the anchor. There's enough time for water-skiing, let's go out again. I swear I won't fool around. I'm tired of it already. Guess what? Mark bought them just for you. - No, it's not true. - Sure it's true. He wouldn't even let me try them on for fear i'd break the spell or something. - I bought them for me! - You've never water-skied in your life. Ask him what story he told his aunt in order to get the money to buy them. It's true, it's true, i'm a sinner. I must suffer for my sins. Don't stop me. You can't stop a sinner for paying for his sins. I have sinned! I am foul! I repent myself of my sins! I must suffer for my sins! I am going to redeem myself. - Alright Mark, the show's over. - What are you up to? Death come to me, at last the time to die has come. - A joke's a joke. - Mark! For a minute I was afraid. It must take guts to do that, don't you think? When you does something like that I don't understand him. - Why does he do it anyway? - No reason, just to do it. You're not like that, are you, Fred? But you know, you're a sulker? You never speak your mind. But why do you never speak? Or are you so only with me? And you? You who has a double life? Me? I have a double life? Yes, you come with us, you joke, you have fun.... And with your sister's friends, what are you like? You always go with them! But I don't have any fun. Maybe, sometimes. Listen, tell me the truth... - This winter, you were in love with Angela? - Who, me? Me in love with Angela? I don't like her at all! If only she were good looking! - Well, she can be very pleasant. - Not to me, for sure! Ah, here! Look at what this morning's activities brought! Was it me? It was Max, he was holding you by the legs. Well, either you or Max, in the meantime the scratch is still there. - Sergia? - Yes. Nothing, I just like to say "Sergia". Damn you! Hey, what are you two, statues? Look alive, come on. Fred, this uncle of yours must be a little bit strange... to you have a shack like this. How old is he? I don't know, 40. Oh look, over there, what's that funny light that keeps going on and off Mark? That's the lighthouse on Cape Carbonara. Really? How do you get there. Well you can't walk, you can't drive either so you take a boat. Let's swim over there one of these days, i'd love to. Why, that would take a whole day, that's if you made it at all. Imagine, to swim out to that rock would take a whole day. And a satellite circles the world in an hour. Hey, would you like to go round the world in a satellite Fred? - I would. - So would I. But you know what i'd like? When they gave me the order to return... I just keep going, get lost in the universe, out in the stars. Lost in the universe! Goes, the summer goes, will never return... I will never forget you, because... Blue days I lived with you... And will remain the most beautiful for me. Blue days I lived with you... And will remain the most beautiful for me. Freddy, pass the bottle there. I was really afraid for you Mark when you dived this morning. Oh that. There's one thing I always know when to do for my friends. - Go on. - I always know when it's time to leave them alone. When I get the message that three's a crowd. It's not the lighthouse on Cape Carbonara, it's the other one... The... I forget the name. On a night like this what i'd like to do is sleep on the beach. Not with the storm that's brewing. Well in that case I guess i'll just get myself up to bed. And tomorrow morning I don't want either of you to wake me up. And no jokes either. When I sleep I sleep. - Are you going to her? - I'm just a little thirsty. Afraid of her? Come on, why don't you go up, make up your mind. What are you waiting for, a written invitation? You are afraid. Then what is it? You wouldn't be in love with her? Oh come on! I'm going up, I was just thirsty. - Coming back down after? - How do I know. Let's not forget your best friend eh? After you, I go. - Fred, is that you? - Yes it is. What are you doing upstairs so quiet? Good, you can help me, come in. I lost the flashlight. What happened? It sounded like you fell down the stairs. No... yes. Sit down. - What's Mark doing? - He's asleep. You know what I was just thinking Fred? That you two were going to sneak off in the night... and leave me alone on the island. I just can't get to sleep tonight. I can't wait till tomorrow. Today was perfect wasn't it Freddy? Mark said we'd get a storm tonight, wonderful. Hey, if the storm carries on tomorrow how will we get back? Better, we'll stay here and have a good excuse when we get home. That's right, we could stay here for months. Why go back at all? We could stay here forever. Freddy? Have you ever made love to anyone? No. But, you've really never been with anyone? Yes, a few times with... with... - If I ask you something will you tell me truth? - Yes. - Promise me that. - Oh sure, I promise. You arranged this little trip? In other words, you brought me here to make love to me? I knew that was why. Ah, a hurricane. Close it quick Freddy. - Where are the matches? - There aren't any. - Well then, now what? - I don't know, try to find the flashlight. I can't see it, oh here it is. It was on the floor. That was exciting wasn't it? - This old shack won't fall apart will it? - Oh no. Now that you know the whole story are you angry? You know, it's normal that a man would think of things like that. But now it's... It's better to stay the way we are. - Sergia, may I stay with you? - Yes, stay right here. Freddy? - You don't think that i'm an easy kind of girl? - No, not at all. Mark? Mark? Ah, Mark. Didn't you go off with Freddy? This time we really pulled a good one didn't we? Can you imagine the reaction when we head home? The aunts, the father and what about Liuli? - I waited all night you know. - What for? For Fred to come down. Why? I saw you last night, what do you think? And don't make believe you didn't know. Know what? Didn't know what Mark? That Freddy and I made a deal, that we came here to make love to you... Make love to you, that's right, one after the other. And if Freddy went before me only because I let him go before me. Mark, that's enough! That's enough Mark, go away, you go away! You went with Freddy, yeah sure, not with me, no I... What are you talking about? You're out of your mind. I'll tell all this to Freddy, all of it, you hear? - You won't say a thing. - Yes I will, i'll tell it all. You know what? You're worse than your sister, you're worse than Liuli. Don't say that, don't say it, don't talk like that of Liuli. No... don't... Leave me alone, leave me alone. Mark, Mark, where are you going? - Hey Mark, wait a minute. Is Sergia at the villa? - No. - Where is she? - I don't know, I haven't seen her. - Well let's go look for her. - You go by yourself. I didn't come here to do nothing but look for her. Hey, naked girl on port side. Hey lonely, you want company? Wait, here I come, i'm coming to get you. Come here, we need a nurse on board and we all look like Mastroianni! Except for ???? Come on over, you can pick the one of us you want. Ciao bella, ciao. Sergia? Hey, help, help. Come and help me. Don't do away. Help. Will you come over here and help me. I'm having a little trouble, a woman in distress. I saw you with the binoculars, you're not a woman, you're a girl. - The man's a maniac. - How old are you? 24 years old. - That old huh, what's your name? - Angela. What in hell are you doing here? Don't you understand that I have nothing on? - I need something to cover myself up with. - Alright, all I have is this. It's not too clean and it smells, you want it? - Yes throw it over. - Here. Get away a little and turn your back please, if you don't mind. For a second, that's all. But please don't use your binoculars. Whatever you do, please don't use them. Alright, don't worry. I'm ready, you can come over. Your motorboat's lovely, pretty good. Wait till I tell you what happened to me, a wild story, you won't believe it. - Thank you. - Where to? Well, I should go back to the island oh but we can go for a ride. - You wanna go for a ride eh? - Yes. What are you stopping for? I thought we were going for a ride. I might like one of those cigarettes you know. Go on, let's hear your story. - I lost my head, I was frightened by a shark. - No? It was a terrifying situation, am I glad you came along. You rich? Why, want to kidnap me? It's a good idea, what else could I do with you? I'll send a ransom note to your father, how much do you think you're worth. Exactly who are? I'll bet this boat isn't even yours. And the dog and even the cigarettes aren't even yours. You go around as if you own the place but you're nothing more than a... hired hand or somebody's chauffeur, that's all. What are you waiting for? Take me back to shore. If you want to stay on board... you'd better learn a few manners! - What are you doing now? - Bye bye. - You're out of you're mind! - Have fun! No, come back here. You're terrible. Come back. Well, I think that should be enough of a dip, alright, come on. Here, grab the oar. That's it, come on. Give me your hand. - There, want a little rub down? - Don't touch me. Stretch out there. But you'll never get dry unless you take off those overalls. If you look around back there there's an old raincoat. Don't worry, I won't look. Here boy. Raincoat, looks more like a boat cover to me. You look out eh, you'll get another bath. There you are. Are you angry? - Angry, why? - Because I threw you back in the water. - I'm a dumb idiot, I deserved it. - Good, then I won't say i'm sorry. Let me see, you're name is Angela? - Angela what? - Tocchiani. - I'll take you to the island to get your things. - Thank you. Are those the rocks over there? I think so, but they all look alike, how can I find the right one? You can put on the overalls again, they must be dry by now. I can't wait to see the look on Freddy's face when I come back like this. Who's Freddy? He's here on the island with me. We're staying in his uncle's house... On the other side of the island with nice beaches. His uncle's house? Very good. - Why do you say that? - Because it's my house. - Ah, then you're Freddy's uncle. - What Freddy? You know who he is, the one on the island with me, your nephew. Oh wait a minute, you probably know him as Frederick don't you? Ah Frederick, yeah sure. Oh yes he's quite a boy that Freddy. In the family we call him Frederick the great. No sign of her yet? What's wrong? Why don't you answer me? You sick or something? Have a fever? Well you can answer me at least. Sergia's disappeared, doesn't that mean anything to you. I don't give a damn what's happened to her. Hey, hey! It's me! - That could be Sergia, but it is Sergia! - Hey, Freddy, Mark. Alot of good you're worrying did you. That's why she agreed to stay here with us so readily... She already had a date with one of her friends. She's outdoing us at our own game. Fred, come on let's leave her here and go on home. At least you got what you wanted from her. You shut up before I punch your face in! Why? It's the truth. Yes you had her and so did I if you want to know... Mark! Don't let her get away with anything boy. Good dog. - How many of you came to the island? - Three, me Fred and Mark. No no no, good dog. - Who is this other one? - Mark? Um... Mark is a cousin. He's almost like a cousin, he's a cousin of my poor mama. Ah, so his name isn't Tocchiani like yours. Tocchiani? No no, Mark is... an orphan. What's that got to do with it? You're right, nothing. I mean he has no mother or father. - You're the only girl alone? - If there were another I would've told you. You didn't tell me about Mark until now. Or maybe Mark doesn't count huh? So you are Angela Tocchiani? 28 years old, divorced form your husband and a few other details. Congratulations. Then you know Angela Tocchiani? That's right, I went around with that crowd for a while. - I wonder if you know Liuli? - You mean little Liuli round heels? Who doesn't?! - I'm her sister, my name is Sergia. - Oh dear! I'm Guido. Sometimes I behave like a birdbrain myself. People say the's are the ruins of a monastery, half monks half pirates. I know they speak badly of Liuli. It's not all true but I guess she's partly to blame. Maybe she's just been unlucky, I don't know. It's not easy, when you live in a small town, like ours. At times, a nickname is enough. You know... I wouldn't have guessed you were so wise! A little too much, for me. Ah, but there's not only these old stones, on the island. Even here, the peace is over, by now! Look down there! Until last year, it was a sort of deserted moorland. And now there's that hotel for nabobs incognito. Look, later you can go down that way... there's a stairway. - Here. - Thanks. As you see, here summer continues even when it's over for the calendar. Unfortunately, my vacations don't get along with the calendar, nor with nature. - You're not really Freddy's uncle are you? I don't even know what he looks like this Freddy! That pair of liars! They both cooked the whole thing up. Mark's capable of anything, but Freddy! I'll make him pay for this. What am I going to do about you? Give you to the police, you and your playboys. What would they book you for? Breaking and entering, loitering, disturbing the peace... And maybe even for theft. - I'm glad the house is yours. - Sure! You're a pretty sly one, you! I imagined the owner as a sort of hermit, with a beard. Well, beard apart, I really like solitude. - I don't believe it! - Indeed, yes! Eventually, out of reaction, because I'm always amongst people. Have you ever been on a liner? No and I wouldn't like to. They're too slow. I spend my life on them. I'm a purser. So in short, you're half friar and half pirate?! Only that with the years, I feel less and less a pirate! Then the forecast is easy... You'll come here to age, and you'll grow a beard! Listen, now that we're friends, tell me your age. Will you tell me the truth? I'm...18. I finished high school this year, and I'm not rich. My father...my father is only a high school teacher. Aren't you a little young to... go off alone with whatstheirnames, Fred and Mark? Whether the house is mine or not... it doesn't make any difference in this situation. Yes, you agreed to stay overnight here, to make love to Freddy and Mark? - With Mark no. - With Freddy then? Made love to Fred with Mark in the place. But nothing happened. No we just slept quietly next to each other, peacefully the whole night. Hey hey, what kind of a story are you handing me?! You came here with your boyfriend and a chaperone named Mark... And you slept the whole night long with him, not Mark, the other one. And you sit there and tell me that nothing happened? That you're still a... You mean you really are...? No. Why did you have to show up? We were so happy here the three of us. Come on Guido, Mark and Freddy must be looking for me. - Freddy? Mark? - She finally remembered us. Here I am. Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Will you tell me where you're going and stop acting like children? Why are you looking at me that way? - You've got some grey hairs. - What?! Look at that, and they're all in the same place, up here. - But are there alot? - Just a few small ones. I got grey hairs because I was so scared. A big shark frightened me out of my wits... I didn't know what to do out there, if it hadn't been for Guido... Guido? Why didn't you tell me my hair was turning grey? I want to see for myself. Do you have a mirror on this tub of yours? Hello boys, hello Freddy, how are you? And you must be Mark. Don't you have anything to say to me? Sergia, Freddy's pretending he doesn't know his own uncle. This man's going to teach you two a lesson... He's the owner of the house. - Sorry, we didn't know. - Sure. Hey it's true! I've got a white streak. It's very chic, I like it. It looks good on me, no? Ah look at you great big liars. "Do you like my uncle's house?". I hope Guido has a sense of humour in him. We'll see about that after i've taken inventory of the damages. Well, I bet you didn't introduce yourselves. That's taken care of. Come on, what's going on? - Where are you going? - We're leaving. - No, why? - It's Mark, he doesn't feel well. No, I feel fine! Leaving here without me? You're out of your minds. Oh very good, both of you are cutting out. Your host arrives and you leave, you two are crawling with manners! He's right, we just can't disappear like... Arabs in the night after breaking into his house. Come on Guido, let's go up and eat, i'm so hungry I can't stand it. You know Fred, if Guido hadn't been there to save me... you weren't worried enough to look for me. Guido, that shack of yours, why don't you take a little better care of it? Sorry, i'll try to do better next time. You should with all the money you earn. Don't think a ship's bursar earns much more than a bank clerk. Why should he? Same job, same pay. I thought men went to sea for the love of it. It's a job like any other, first you get on a ship bound for South America... and for two years all you see is South America. Then you sign on to another ship... and for two years you see another part of the world. And after that you probably get sent back to South America. You didn't eat a thing, don't you feel alright? - Are you a doctor too? - No, just wondering what's wrong. Why would you, what do you care? You can't imagine anyone being worried about you? Mark, when you with friends don't forget you've got to know how to... Hey Guido, you know what Fred just told me? Any man who looks at a girl through binoculars is an old lech. Sure, and he's right, only I wonder what he would've done in my place. Well I would've done the same thing but then i'm not you're age! I walked right into that one didn't I?! Go on, keep it up, I can take it. Come on Mark, there must be a thermometer at the house. I'll give you an aspirin and tomorrow you'll be good as new. Alright, nothing for me to do here anyway. I'm taking the invalid to the house. No no, you stay there, you can catch up on lost time. Well what are you waiting for? Here boy, you come too, let's leave them alone. Why did he say that, why Sergia? What did you tell him? Me? Nothing. Besides, I wonder who he is. You heard what he said, he knows everyone in town even Liuli. - Then you met him through Liuli? - I guess so somewhere. - What is it? - Nothing. Listen Mark, the whole world's got it in for you, that's what you think. Oh Mark, the world doesn't give a damn about you or about me or anyone. If you want things to go your way you forget the world. You shouldn't feel so alone, not with a friend like Freddy. - Well isn't he your friend? - Yes, Freddy's the only one. But he has it easy. I don't know why but I always spoil everything. - Like today. - Had an argument with him? That's natural, two of you with one girl, that always means trouble. Last week I stole 50,000 lira from my aunt. And what did you do with it? I needed it for this weekend, I bought the waterskis with it. A friend of mine at school used to steal silverware once in a while. Now he's one of the best doctors in town, there you are. I'm ashamed to return to the house... Because they won't even say anything about it. But I know they need that money. Listen Mark... We're friends now. - Would you accept a loan? - What? There's no hurry for you to return it... As long as you don't steal from your aunts. Oh no, i'm afraid not. I couldn't take it, I... I can't give you the whole 50 but try to manage with this. Splayed summertime, season of dense climates... of grand mornings, of dawns without noise, of identical, astral days, the least painful season, extreme season, you fall prostrate in enormous reposes, season that brings light, to stretch the time, beyond the boundaries of the day. Whose is it Guido? Cardarelli! They don't teach you Cardarelli at school! Alright troops, let's have a little council of war. Tomorrow morning I don't want any arguments, we get up at dawn. Oh Mark, you come with me, I have the faster boat. - Alright? - But... The way you've got me wrapped up in blankets here... I don't think i'll be able to leave for a month. - Go on, you love to play the invalid. - Give it to him. Doesn't everybody? Freddy, come here a minute. Everything's just like last night... except for you. Today you said "We're so happy here, the three of us on the island." Does that mean there's one too many now? No. Look at Freddy go and here I thought he was the rocking chair type! After, I want to see what the admiral can do. Oh, i'm dead. Freddy, you're good, you've got style. I don't know what kind of style but style. Now me. - You're really livening up the place. - It's the only dance I know. - You know Guido, i've discovered what type you are. - Go on. You're the kind that wants to everything about others... without telling anything about himself. If I told you about myself it would sound like a grandfather's tale. Besides a man tells his life story with his face. Maybe then in a young man's face you can see what he's to become? Sure, maybe, except for the knocking about you get on the way. You think to get anywhere the only thing that counts is luck? For some kinds of success you need luck but... for some other kinds that are more profound... I don't think so. Hey, according to you, how do you think Freddy is going to succeed? Freddy will do everything to become a man. That's pretty good and you? Are you a man? It seems to be that I am but... when I look back too long I wonder if I ever really was. - Guido. - What? Let's hear what's going to happen to me. What am I, a fortune teller?! Let's drop it and go to bed, come on. And you, aren't you asleep yet? I wonder what papa & Liuli will say when they see my white streak. A souvenir of the shark, quite a souvenir isn't it? And can't you just hear... Antonietta stuttering over it tomorrow when I get home? Good night Mark, sleep, sweat, keep warm. - You'd better be alright tomorrow. - If not we'll leave you here. Some Robinsoe Crusoe you'd make. Sergia, come here. - What do you want Mark? - Nothing, this morning... - Angry with me? - No Mark, i'm not angry. Then give me a kiss. Good night Mark. - Night. - Goodnight. Want the lamp? - You know how to light it? - Yes, of course. Good night boy. You're still hungry? Here. - Night Mark. - Goodnight Fred. Why did you tell me today that you were... - Why didn't you tell me the truth? - I don't know. Is it so important that I be the way I was? It's a choice. Tge first encounter with life. A girl chooses wrong, makes a mistake... and some way that mistake stays with her. You tell me that? When I came in you could've screamed. It wouldn't have even had to scream, just tell me to go away, that's all. Or even better, you could've told me the truth. Stop Guido. Please my dear don't, don't cry. No, don't cry. Sergia. Sergia. Mark. - Take it back, I don't want it. - Why not? - I'm always in everybody's way. - Come on Mark, that's not true. I know, I know that if I left you'd all be happier. - Did you find him? - No. You're boat is still at the dock but ours has disappeared. He's mad going out alone with a fever. What are you talking about a fever? I know why Mark went away, I know why. I know where you were. Damn you, I know where you spent the night. What's more you have it spelt all over your face, do you know that? Look, what in hell do you want? You want to make me angry or something? You want to fight? Say it, go on. Or maybe you'd better settle for a little boat ride, get back home. Seeing as you don't have a boat anymore. Sit down! Sit down! Look over there, the boat. But it's Mark. That's our boat. Here's the blanket he had on his bed. Come over here. That's all there was on the boat. Is that enough sir? No, take a couple of the stains, here, here... and these two. - Do you have enough of the position of the body? - Yes. I heard him leave but I thought the boy only wanted to be alone. To return to the city. I never thought of something like this. I should have I guess. I only knew him a few hours but it's funny, right from the start... Alright, alright, come this way. - Empty boat to come in. - Bring the boat in. It was instantaneous and caused by a fracture at the base of the cranium. With epistaxis and probably paralysis of the... cardio-circulartory and respitory systems. Oh and make a note of the lacerations, contusions and multiple ecchymosis. Did the get the probable time of death? I estimated it at 6 or 7 hours ago. That about does it. Get everything down? I'll make a complete autopsy later. Yes, that'll do it, you can take him away now. I think i've got just about everything I need, you can take him away now. - You're finished? - For the time being, yes. Right away sir, right away. Over here, this way. Sergia... we have to go. Sergia. No Sergia. Stop it Sergia. Come on, let's go. One moment. One more please. Thank you. Look this way, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. - How long will you be gone major? - As long as the fuel lasts! - Bye Sandra, and thanks for everything. - Bye dad. - A hug for my new daddy! Uh, no tears! Sergia give me a kiss. My little sister-in-law! - Bon voyage! - Bye! - Here is our photographer! - Another one, major? - Alright, one of me too! Thank you! - The major is really nice! - But Elvira... ...you discover Osvaldo the very day of his wedding! A little too late! - Oh, well! - Coming with us? I'll give you a lift home. - No thank you, I'm going with Giulio. - Bye. - Bye. Sergia. Sergia! One moment dad, excuse me. - Hi! How are you? - Fine and you? When did you get here? Last night. I Called home and Antonietta told me... - How long will you stay? - It depends... Are you coming with me? Yes, ok. - Dad, I'm coming back with him. - Alright! Bye! - Aren't you going to the party? - There is no party. - They preferred to leave right away. - A quiet wedding! You know that i've always defended Liuli. After all, even now I don't feel like... Yeah sure, she always went for the money! Finally she succeeded! - What have you decided to do then? - I had an interview for an interpreter. - This means that if you get it you'll leave. - I think so. Why do you do it? Why do you want to leave? You still think about Freddy. No, I never was in love with Freddy. No. Maybe, if in those two days on the island... In short, if things had been different... I'd be his girlfriend, now. Yes, almost certainly i'd be. And sooner or later we'd have ended up being man and wife, Freddy and I. But it didn't happen. Who knows then who failed. If it was me or Freddy. Or you! Would you blame me, now? You mean I shouldn't have... No, I really don't want to blame you for anything. But you didn't give me the time to love you. I want to marry you Sergia. I understand you Guido. You found me different and now... now you'd like to... sort of redress. - Don't you think so? - It is not so. I'm not the type for such feelings and it's not easy to say some things. That I thought I wouldn't speak for the rest of my life. I... I love you. I love you, you must believe me. No, I can't marry you just because... Just for convenience, or for any other reason. When, for me, i'm missing the first, the true, reason. You don't feel anything for me!? No Guido, it's not true. You were the first man in my life. But I can't love you just for that. I'm 18 Guido! - You'll always get along, I know it. - You don't still think i'm crazy? I'm glad you are. I envy your courage you know. - Oh how I envy it. - Liuli, i'm not going to war! And I admire you. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao Antonietta - Ciao and k-k-keep well. - Ciao papa. - Ciao, have a good trip and write once in a while. Have a good trip sir. Miss. You'll have a 50 minute delay over at Rome. Flight 270 for Brussels leaves at 4.45. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. - Please? - Rome. Sergia? You'll never forget me, I know Guido. I know and i'll never forget you. What's more, I have a momento... The streak! I'll have it the rest of my life. Flight 270 destination Rome and Brussels now boarding at gate 2.
