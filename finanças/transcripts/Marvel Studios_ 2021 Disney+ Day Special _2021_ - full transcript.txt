So, what's a single gal like you doing rattling around this big house? Well, I assure you, I'm married. Welcome home. Is this really happening? Is it really you? Yes, my love. And they lived happily ever after. Wanda? Wanda? Can you hear me? This isn't a missing persons case, Captain Rambeau. It's a missing town. Howdy, neighbors! Something's wrong here, Wanda. We are in uncharted waters. - He's dead, right? - But where's Rambeau? - Wanda! - Who are you? Are you here to help us? Maximoff, in her grief, is holding thousands of people hostage. Don't let him make you the villain. Maybe I already am. What is grief, if not love persevering? Don't worry, darling. I have everything under control. You have no idea what you've unleashed. The only way forward... is back. This world will always be broken. Just like you. This is our home. Then let's fight for it. We just don't know what to expect. World's a crazy place right now. Everybody's looking for somebody to fix it. Why didn't you take up the mantle? You know the first words I said to Steve when he told me about the shield? I said it feels like it belongs to someone else. So, Mr. Barnes, are you still having nightmares? You've got to maintain friendships. Why did you give up that shield? Maybe this is something you will never understand. You think you can wake up one day and decide who you wanna be? It doesn't work like that. But the world's different now. They will never let a Black man be Captain America. Stay the hell out of my way. This will not stop. It will escalate. You buy into all of that stars and stripes bull... We built this country. Bled for it. I'm not gonna let anybody tell me I can't fight for it. You don't wanna do this. Yeah, we do. The only power I have is that I believe we can do better. We're going to need all hands on deck for whatever's coming next. Appears to be a standard sequence violation. Variant identified. - I beg your pardon? - You're coming with us. Get out of my way. Welcome to the Time Variance Authority. I'm Miss Minutes, and it's my job to catch you up before you stand trial for your crimes. What is this place? Sometimes, people like you veer off the path the Time-Keepers created. We call those "Variants." Ah! Hello. Love is a dagger. It's beautiful until it makes you bleed. Big metaphor guy. I love it. Makes you sound super smart. - I am smart. - I know. Been a long journey for you, hasn't it? Lot of running... lot of pain. An all-out... Multiversal War. It's best not to question it. I have been waiting for this moment my entire life. We write our own destiny now. Looking for directions, sir? Because you seem to have lost your way. The multiverse, where a single choice can branch out into infinite universes... creating alternate worlds from the ones you know... T'Challa. I told you I wanted to see the world. You showed me the universe. Creating all-new heroes. The name's Captain Carter. More than battles won or lost, it's relationships that truly define us. They can't ask you to go. They're not asking. He's your friend. We'll need all the friends we can get. Heroes... Are people. People willing to give their lives for something greater than themselves. We're in. Even in the darkest of times, humans will give all to save their planet. Nothing is impossible. You taught me that. This mission requires a team... and you have been chosen. One second. Ah, there it is. Woo! Let's do this! What? You've been hiding that the entire time? - One moment... - Go, go, go! Can ripple across space and time... giving birth to... new heroes. I can't go home... till I fix this. Look, I know this may sound weird, but I've dreamed of this for as long as I can remember. When I put that suit on, I thought, "This is it. "This is the moment I become who I'm supposed to be." I remember the day I thought the same thing. You know, this life you wanna live, it comes with a price. Well, there's also things you gain... Like trick arrows and a cool costume. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm not a role model to anyone. Yes, you are. As far as I'm concerned, we're in this together. Do you mind getting that? My mom canceled my credit card. We need a car. Oh, can we take this one? Man, this thing is beautiful. I'm not smashing a '72 Challenger. Come on. Let's go. Hey. Get over here. I need you to drive. - What? I don't know how to drive. - Come over here. No, you... You drive. I shoot. I'm not hearing you. You drive. Okay? Come on. Come on! Let's go, let's go! - How many we got? - Four! Hang on. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're out of regular arrows. What do you mean... Oh, my God, trick arrows? Definitely not this one. You don't have to say "definitely" like that. Not this one. - It's too dangerous. - Is this one fine? I'm using this one. - You have to be careful. - I was born careful. They're not regular arrows. Eenie, meenie, - miney, mo. - Come on, come on. Holy... There are arrows more dangerous than that one? A plunger arrow? What, is the trick that it's completely useless? Hang on, hang on. - That was amazing! - Kate, follow me. So, today... we look to the future. I can't tell the difference between my waking life and dreams. The voice... in your head... it devours you. I'm Jennifer Walters. I'm a normal lawyer. Well, not that normal. These transformations are triggered by anger and fear. Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. Kamala, let's talk about you. It's not really the brown girls from Jersey City who save the world. Maybe now they do. - I got this, right? - Totally. What's next? You are in for one hell of a ride. Let's get to work.
