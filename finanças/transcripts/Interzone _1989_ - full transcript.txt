[ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Hey! [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music ] [ Laughter ] [ Music ] [ Clapping ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Music ] I wouldn't give you shit for it. I understand when this place ran, this whole place was under water. The water was too freaking hot, too. Yeah-- they say they a got fish down there with two heads. Hey, what's this deal about, uh, somebody looking for some hired hands or something? Ripped something off, you know what I'm saying? Well-- refresh on your drinks, gentlemen? No, doing okay, thanks. Yeah, but I think they hire depend on the need. These guys understand that they [ Indistinct ]. Yeah, how are they paying? Who knows... Part of the treasure. Oh, I could use some treasure. We all could use some treasure. Swan: Somebody say something about treasure? What do you want, Sanjay? Why don't you make my friends and I one of those black drinks you're famous for, butt face? You were saying? Anyway, there's this place called Interzone. It's up in this hill. They have no protection, no protection at all. We could go in there and steal from them. It's like takin' candy from babies. So, why didn't you go? Yeah. 'Cause I don't work for no boss, that's why. No woman boss, anyway. [ Music ] So, you're not talking about romanticizing? She's got, like, arms like this, she's about six feet tall with this blonde hair and shit? Mmm-hmm. I don't blame ya. Listen, that game is gonna start pretty soon. You wanna go play? Let's get out of here. [ Music ] What kind of game is this? Well, basically, you drink the wrong drink, and-- [ music ] Ahh! [ Applause ] You're kidding! Wanna do it? No! Yeah! [ Applause ] Rat: [ Indistinct ]. New game! New game! You want adventure? [ Applause ] Come on. [ Applause ] [ Speaking foreign language ] Okay. For you-- for you. For you. Okay. [ Speaking foreign language ] Go! Let's do it! Ready, general? [ Shrieking ] Put in your ante's, please. All right. Okay. Your basic Interzone white. Okay! [ Applause ] We're good! Come on! [ Cheering ] And you? Here with me, this, a golden shaver. That's good! [ Cheering ] A watch. It tells time perfectly. Twice daily. [ Laughing and applause ] You, where's your ante? Hey! [ Music ] What do you think about it? It's great! [ Applause ] Begin! [ Music ] Hey! You. [ Music ] [ Groaning ] [ Applause ] Ha-ha-- you! [ Music ] Hey. Ha-ha-- ah-ah-ah! [ Applause ] [ Speaking foreign language] I told you. Spin again, huh? You. [ Music ] Pick a glass. Hey! Nah-nah-nah-nah. You're cheating. Go on back. Take your glass. Hey! [ Music ] You son of a bitch! [ Applause ] Watch my eye! Ohh! [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Balzakan: Treasure is almost within reach. Soon it will be ours, Mantis. Mantis: You are so right, Balzakan. They don't stand a chance. They look pathetic. I think we shall waste them. You are absolutely right. Unite your mental forces together, brothers. That will protect the treasure which will in turn protect the Interzone. Ready! Fire! Whoa-- whoa-- ho-- ho! Whoa-- whoa-- whoa-- ho! Damn them! All miserable, piss elegant fairies! We're gonna see you dead. [ Music ] I am tired. I feel that my time is almost over. [ Music ] Reverend. Yes, general? You will take my place. Take my hand. My power is yours. You must stop Mantis and Balzakan from finding their way through our shield and stealing our treasure. The treasure holds the secret of life. Without it, the Interzone will collapse and all will die. We cannot stop them, but someone can... A stranger in my dreams. His name is Swan. Panasonic, please come here. Panasonic: I am here, general. You, Panasonic, must find Swan. You also were in the dream. And the woman with gold hair and eyes like the sky, the three of you will save the Interzone. Where do I look, my general? The Interzone is a big place. Panasonic, i-- oh. I-- oh-oh-oh. I'll miss you, my general. [ Music ] [ Music ] Ah! Oh, no-- oh, no. [ Indistinct ] What do I do now? I have failed my mission. Ah, please forgive me, my general. I am so stupid. [ Music ] Oh, I'm sorry, my general. Please forgive me. Please-- help. Please, forgive me. [ Music ] Please forgive me, my general. I've got to leave-- please. [ Music ] [ Music ] Take this. It's just coffee. Get your insides going. You're lucky I came along when I did. So, where are you from? Why are you dressed like that? What's the matter? Can't you speak? I talk. It doesn't matter now. My people have a rule. We never speak. Sounds like a thrilling group of people to be around. We speak with the mind. Okay, man. You see, I am speaking to you now, but my lips do not move. That's simple. Ventriloquism. But I can read your mind. Sure you can. You are thinking about a girl, a beautiful girl. Her hand reaching for you-- okay-- oh-okay. Just hold it right there, mister. All right. What am I thinking of now? A dog-- a pet dog that died. Bingo! That was not his name. I know. Bingo, you're right. I can't believe this. Oh, we could make a lot of money-- with your power and my brains. Yes, maybe. But first, you must do for me a great task. Piece of cake. [ Indistinct chatter ] Yes. [ Indistinct chatter ] This is nuts. Oh, yeah. I take lessons all the time. I'm selling them as one lot. The flow. So, what do we have here? Ha-- good catch, huh? What's that? [ Speaking foreign language ] I'm selling them as one lot! Servant, or moles, huh? I don't understand a word he says. How about this one-- huh? [ Music ] You-- I remember you. You are the game from cantina. I want her. How much you want to pay for this bitch? How about a couple of welts, shithead. What do you mean? Ha-ha. You give me the girl now, you live. You don't, you die. Simple. I think you are a little crazy, my friend. Anyone moves-- okay-- okay. Cupcake here buys it. Okay-- okay-- okay-- okay. Okay. [ Screaming ] Christ! Nice move. Great, let's get out of here! Get up! Ah-- get! What are you doing-- go! Get that bastard! [ Speaking foreign language ] Come on-- come on! Stake him-- get it! Go-- go! [ Music ] Let's get out of here. [ Music ] Tera: Thanks for saving me. [ Music ] [ Indistinct ] [ Music ] Okay-- I'm gonna fire. [ Music ] Take the wheel! Take the wheel! [ Screaming ] [ Music ] Stop it-- stop it. [ Music ] [ Music ] Eat this! Suck on this! [ Music ] Don't let me disturb you now from almost dying. [ Music ] Oh, shit! Keep the car under control. [ Music ] That's rat! [ Music ] Oh-ho! Yah! Watch out-- he's coming! Go-- go! Aah! [ Music ] [ Speaking foreign language ] Look, look-- look in front! [ Music ] So, we meet again. What's your name? Tera. Hi, Tera. What is your name? Swan. Hi, Swan. Oh, no. Oh, my beautiful car, no. I'm going to kill him. Yes, I'm going to kill to him! Yes! So you're saying your people are responsible for the treasure in the Interzone? What exactly is the Interzone? It's this. This 300 square mile area of radio-active free land. It's supposedly a freak of nature. If certain important items are taken from the treasure, the Interzone will collapse and the whole fine distinction will begin. So, what exactly does the treasure consist of? I cannot say. And I'm supposed to risk my life? I'm sorry. You have to trust me. Once we lived in peace with it, in a complete mental and spiritual retreat. Then, they came. Mantis and Balzakan and their ferocious bands of savages. They joined together to try and beat it, and steal the treasure. Mantis is a savage. [ Applause ] Shut up! You really disappointed me in bed. What? [ Laughter ] That really bothers me. But, I love you. [ Laughter ] Don't listen to them. You promised me! Sorry. I changed my mind. I think it's time for the hole. No, no, no, no, no! If you can get out, you can live. Do you like him? [ Roaring ] [ Cheering ] He said he loved me. Not anymore. [ Laughter ] Mantis is a devil who wears a dress. What a slut. And then there was Balzakan. He loves to play with people like a cat. My only brother and his wife happen to be-- Hello! I seem to be out of water, and I'm dying of thirst. I could use a nice, long drink. Oh. Pregnant? Uh-huh. I think it's a boy. I can tell, you know... By the way they kick. Do you want water or not? [ Music ] My brother took his life the same day. I am so sorry. That's when you decided to become a veteran. Yes. And that's why I will do anything to help you defeat them. Just how many warriors are there? Not more than 60 or so. Just child's play for you. Oh, yeah, that'll be no problem. Now, we must sleep. Here-- here are some blankets. Here-- I've got a coat. [ Music ] Get myself killed. Why me? I'm a nice guy. Good-night, girl. It is better, isn't it? So far, so good. You are a brave man, Swan. I was afraid you were gonna say that. Now, let's get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow. I was afraid you were gonna say that. [ Music ] Tell me, how does it feel when you are about to die? Huh? [ Laughter ] All right? I'm gonna blow your brains out, and then I kill you. [ Gunshot fires ] [ Crying ] Thank you. Mary-- oh, god! Ah-ha-ha-- muah-muah-muah. Excuse me. Are you finished? Good-- stand up, and take your clothes off. What? You heard me. [ Speaking foreign language ] Yes! These? No-no-no, leave those. Okay. Hand those to me. Yes! [ Speaking foreign language ] Yeah-- thank you. Thank you. I'm very happy, thank you. Have a nice [ Indistinct ]. I love you. Thank you, god. Thank you-- thank you. [ Music ] Okay-- I'm already in this over my head. We almost got killed getting here. Now, my guess is that there's part of the treasure that the Interzone doesn't depend on. Now, that's the part I want. So there it is. Take it or leave it. I'm sorry. Everyone listen to me. Excuse me, but general electric said nothing before dying about giving away part of the treasure as payment. This man is to protect it, not take it. Swan? You have a deal. Good luck, son. Oh, and by the way, flat top goes with me. [ Music ] [ Music ] So, we've known each other for, how long-- what? 48 hours. I know it. Seems it was just yesterday. I-I-I know that I seem like I'm probably much larger than life, but I'm just a normal guy who gets lucky sometimes. Ha-- that Panasonic, he hates waiting. He's-- it makes him irrational. You know you are my hero. I guess- I guess so. [ Music ] You really handled the flame thrower. Huh, don't forget about the bullwhip. I would never forget your bullwhip. Anyway, I um-- just want you to know that... when you're with me, uh, your life is going to be in total danger. It's around every corner, behind every tree. A fox-- a sheep. I don't care. No-- you like that sort of thing, do you? I don't like it, I love it. [ Gunshots firing ] [ Music ] [ Music ] That's right, Tera. The only way to destroy them is to turn Mantis and Balzakan against each other. How do you plan on doing that? I have absolutely no idea. [ Music ] Thank you. That's good. I like that. What have we got here? Listen, I captured one of the old men with regards to the treasure and I have an idea how to get our hands on it. Wait a minute. I don't like fuzzy faced foreigners, especially ones with ideas. To have ideas, you have to have a brain. Personally, I don't think you have one. And who do you think you are, big boy? All that matters is the treasure. Thanks for the gift. I'd love to make chop suey out of you. Hold it, ass wipe. Who the hell are you calling "ass wipe?" Stop. Stop! All right. Tonight, you're coming to my chambers and if you fulfill my expectations, your life will be spared. Then maybe we can talk treasure. Swan! Who the hell is this? Nobody. It's a slave, that's all. Maybe I'll have her later. And him. Torture him. As you wish. Feeling better? Yeah. [ Music ] Okay, baby. Let's see what you got. Jack: Hi, Fred. Fred: Jack. How you doing? Not bad. You working out? Little bit. Can I have a puff of that cigarette? Sure would like to be manhandled by that Mantis. Just listen to him. Yeah, you know it! Gee, what've you been doing? You look great. Where do you work out? I'd sure like to get in shape like you are. You're in pretty good shape, though. Yeah, yeah. But you know how it is. You always want to get better. [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Panasonic-- Panasonic? Tera. Shh-- I was worried about you. How are you? I am fine. Ah, that Tera. I take these off for you. What are you trying to do? I'm-I'm gonna kill him. That's what I'm going to do. Why would you kill him? Your master will never find the treasure without him. He is not my master. I am not a slave. He betrayed me. You-- you will take his place. What do you mean? Will you take me? Well, that depends on your definition of take. You take me, and we get the treasure. [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Cheering ] Okay, baby. I've done my duty. Now why don't we get down to something more important, like treasure? Like the hole? And if you can get out alive, you can be my lover for life. And if you don't? Well, you're not gonna be good for anyone. Wait a minute, I thought the rule was if I satisfied you-- I have got a new rule. Uh, listen, baby cakes-- I would love to be part of the new rule making-- maybe you'd like to know a little bit about gray. I know, I know, let's just get this over with. Okay-- well, let me show you now something you've got to look forward to. Come on out, honey. I got a little appetizer for you. Come on. Now, Grant, don't be rude. Remember, it's just an appetizer. Maybe he wants a first course. [ Screaming ] [ Laughter ] Now, it's your turn. But be careful in there. I think you're swell. Me, too-- gotta go. [ Music ] [ Music ] Okay-- I killed him. Can I come out now? [ Music ] [ Applause ] My hero. No-no-no, let's just talk about the treasure. But, baby, the barrier. There's a weakness in the barrier. Anybody from the outside breaks through, the barrier is destroyed. You get the treasure. [ Cheering ] You can do better than this. All right, skin head. So there's a weak point in the barrier, is there? I can't believe this. I really don't believe this. You know, it was balls you called him in a way. You're going to pay big for this. I never trusted him. Yeah, well-- let's go. Don't poke. The next one's in your mouth. Balzakan! Mantis. Wanted the treasure for yourself? I was just getting him to tell us how to get it, for both of us. Oh, come on. You don't believe that. He's obviously made a deal with the wench. That slut over there! What? Ah-- ha-ha-ha! Let's dominate 'em! [ Music ] [ Music ] Just a little too confident. You had to call me "a slut?" Well, it worked! [ Music ] Hurry! I can see it-- wait! You're fine. Panasonic, I want you to go back to the veterans. Tera, you go with him. I have to blow up their ammo supply. You never should have told them about the weak point of the barrier. Weak point in the barrier? You're kidding. I made that up. I must help you. No, listen. I'll be all right. You... you nut. I gotta go. I'm going with him. Panasonic, you must keep an eye on Swan and Tera. Yes, but, where are you? [ Music ] What are you doing? I don't want to leave you. [ Music ] Let's go. You ready, babe? Yes-- I love you and that will never change. Let's go. [ Music ] Maybe I should have stayed with Panasonic. "Maybe I should have stayed "with Panasonic." [ Music ] [ Cheering ] Did you really think we would believe those lies, Swan? James! [ Music ] When you fall, she fries. Why don't you tell everybody what you told me in bed last night... About your special touch? He's all yours now, Balzakan. I'm really going to enjoy this. [ Music ] No! [ Music ] Look-- you killed her. No! [ Music ] Oh, my friend... What a terrible thing. I am in debt to you. Panasonic, I killed her. No, my friend, it wasn't you. Please, give me the power to save him. [ Music ] [ Music ] What have you done? I did what needed to be done. You must save the Interzone and the treasure. Remember, one cannot exist without the other. Like you and I, my friend. Now, don't get corny. [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Well, what are you? A bunch of wimps? I want that door down, now. We have to blow it up. No problem-- I got it. Fool. What are you trying to do? Destroy the treasure? [ Music ] Go on! You'll choke to death. Let's get out of here! I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. You have two choices. Run or you can run. Good choice. [ Music ] Hmm-- self-detonating hump. [ Music ] You're supposed to be dead. Not very fair, is it? I suppose that doesn't make any difference to you. [ Music ] [ Music ] Not bad-- not bad. You know how you're gonna die? I'm gonna crush your throat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna hit you so hard, your dog's gonna die. [ Music ] Come on! [ Music ] Ah! [ Music ] I was expecting you. Got the treasure now. You know, we're a lot alike. We're both dominators in this world, aren't we? Why don't you join me? Together, and the treasure. We can rule the Interzone. Oh, baby, you're hurt. [ Music ] [ Music ] Looks like this is the final chapter. Depends on which book you read. [ Music ] [ Music ] This is a message for the future generations of the human race, if there is any. This is the year zero for her. The great madness has destroyed everything and soon, all will be ashes. This testimony to our civilization will remain to show how we once lived. My men and I have gathered what we can to get the most beautiful things that man created. Here, you can read, study, examine and understand them so that you will never-- all you see here is from our past. Without it, there is no future. Swan, you may take what you want from our treasure. I had a treasure... A loyal friend... And a woman I loved. [ Music ] Oh, god-- you're alive! Yeah! You're breathing. You're alive! Panasonic? [ Music ] What do we do now? Hmm-- I have a great idea. [ Music ]
