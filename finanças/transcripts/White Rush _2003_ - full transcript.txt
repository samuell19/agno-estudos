[MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Aw, man, these things are excellent. All right, who wants a margarita light? None for the cop, I guess. No, no, not for me, bro. I'm fine. Right here, sir. Thank you. - Good man. - No, you're the good man. Thank you. - Good man. I enjoy your work. Arlene, El, not drinking? Come on, baby. If I mix this stuff, the least you can do is drink it. You guys have been making this trip for 10 years, and you seem to have a different girl every time. Who's punk redhead with the spiked hair? She doesn't look like the outdoor type. Miss Razor Blade. She had her nipples pierced with this barbed-wirey thing connecting them. Yeah, she was sweet. Thank you for that. Yes, this was-- no, this was in my after-hours club phase, a long time ago. Not like now? No. Mm mm. [LAUGHTER] I'm going to kill you later. Thanks, Arlene. [MUSIC PLAYING] I hate doing business with these guys. They got no concept of time. You gotta have a little bit more faith in people. Hola, amigo. I'm glad you could make it. All right. We've got to test it. Comprende? Hey, I thought we reached a level of trust. My partner's a little bit paranoid. You cholos are always pulling shit. Hey, you know your monkey's got a smart mouth. I know. We're working on it. Did you do these? Yeah. God, you are talented. Thank you. You--you should commission Arlene to do a painting for you office. You know, like a Cayman Island bank account. Yeah, I-- I-- I'll keep you to that smart ass. He really is a great guy. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, right. OK, enough with the kissing, will ya? Enough of that. Get a room. Sex room. You're familiar with that? A couple of hours, you guys will be pissing in your pants, hung over with all the booze you've been drinking, and I'll be casting in this beautiful stream, under the eyes of mother nature. Mm. It looks good. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Fuck, man. They're 10% fucking light. It's the minimum, man. It's stacked to the fucking bottom. What are we? Family, for fuck's sake? 10% is acceptable. Don't worry about it. Yeah, fucking try measuring that by every fucking pound. Considering the size of the buy-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] --it's nothing. OK? How much is a bullet worth? Do we have a deal or not? You're actually going to go through with this? That's why we're here. Now take it down a million. No se? Monkey said it's OK? Everything is fine. OK. All right, this is-- you fucking greasers, man. Fucking greasers. You want to play rough, huh? You wanna fuck with us? We'll see, man. Amigo, that's how you feel? [GUNSHOTS] [GASPS] Did you hear that? Listen, man. Listen. [GUN SHOTS, GASPS, AND SCREAMS] That's gunfire. I'm telling you, that's gunfire. Nah, that's a hunter or something. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Hey, oh, come on. No, I'm serious, Tug. Chick, I'll- I'll come with you. Jay, stay. Stay put. No, relax, man. Relax. Sit down. No, no, no, no. Wait here. - Where are you going? Come on. I'll be back. What is this all about? [GROAN] What is wrong with him? It's cop paranoia. Hey, Jay, you know what? You're coming with me. No, he said stay. Yes, you are. We're going to screw with him. Come on. We'll be back very shortly. We'll be back, ladies. Don't drink all my margaritas. Have fun, children. Oh, they are too much. LAPD, drop your weapon. [GROAN] Now. Drop the weapon. [INAUDIBLE] [GUNSHOT] This is beautiful. Oh, shit. Jesus Christ, I could have killed the both of you. I told you to stay back, didn't I? We stumbled on the middle of a drug war. Oh my god. Call of the battle, brother. A lot of people die for this shit every day. What we've got to do right now is get out of here. We gotta call someone. This is a crime scene. You gotta call the local police. - Forget it, Jay. I'm all the police you're going to need. Let's move. Move! A A cop. This is beautiful. Where were you? Are you all right? Chick, was that really shooting you heard? It wasn't shooting. It was a massacre. He's got a bag full of cocaine, honey. What are you talking about? What is all this? Go on. Take a look. It's cocaine. That's right. It's cocaine. Now listen up. It was a drug buy that turned to shit. But what we've got to worry about is packing this stuff up and getting out of here right now. But why? Because in about 15 minutes this place is going to be swarming with DEA agents, and we don't want to answer any questions until we figure some things out. Like what? Our good fortune and their bad luck. Let's pack this up and move. Jay, help me out now. Come on. What? You're not thinking of keeping that stuff. Somebody just got killed for it. Isn't that what you said? We don't have time for this right now now. Oh my god. I don't believe this. I'm not going to be part of some illegal deal. No. Hey, hey, hey. Nobody said anything about anything illegal. OK? Why don't we talk to the agents if you're not doing anything illegal? You want to be held as a material witness? What we've got to do right now is go somewhere safe and figure this thing out together. This stuff ruined my life once. I know this stuff. I am not going to be part of any of this anymore. Come on, baby. You're going off the deep end here. OK? Now act like an adult for five minutes. OK? - OK. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you want out, that's fine. But what we're going to do from now on is none of your business. Tell me something. Wasn't your brother going to do 10 to 20, cocaine possession and intent? Tug calls me up. He asks me to pull some strings. I tell you this. You say anything to anyone, I will reopen his case so fast, and your baby brother-- I don't believe this. -will be spending the best part of his life behind bars. Are you with me? You make your own decision. I'm not going to say anything to anybody. But I am not going to be part of this. Hey, wait a minute. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look at me. Hey. Ow! Goddamn bitch. Go! Goddamn it. You OK? I saw that. Shit, give me a minute. I gotta go get her. Give me a minute. What am I going to do? Leave her? - Take a look, will ya? Running through the woods like a fucking gazelle. She's going to be there way before we are, for Christ's sake. She'll get to the highway. She'll flag a car. She'll be just fine. OK? We've got to worry about us. We got to get the hell out of here right now. Come on. - Jesus Christ, Chick. What'd you get us into? A helluva lot of money. We gotta go. Let's move. Come on. Tug, we gotta go. Come on. [CRYING] [GASP] Oh, god. Stop. Please don't kill me. I'm not going to hurt you. Sh. Are you with that cop? Yes or no. Are you with the cop? All right. You're going to come with me. I'm injured, so you're going to drive me to a friend's house. I'll show you the way. Listen to me. In about five minutes, the woods are going to be crawling with bad guys. I don't want to die out here. Do you? Do you want to die out here? Mm mm. So let's go. Come with me now, or I will shoot you in the leg and carry you. That's a good girl. Get in. Where you taking me? You'll know when we get there. Let's go. Oh, lord. I knew it. Look, I told you. Take no chances. Now look at you. Look, skip the lecture and let us in, OK? I think I let a gallon of blood out there. Yeah, probably not all yours. Watch your step. On the couch. Thanks. How'd you end up in all of this, miss? An innocent bystander. Yeah, that can be very dangerous. Yeah, you don't have to tell me. Oh, look at this boy. I'll get the first aid. Don't forget the brandy. [LAUGHING] Nothing like finding a million in cash. Jesus. More than that, buddy. More than that. The million must have been the buy money. The coke-- rough guess from what I've seen, street value could be worth up to as much as $6 million. I'm beholden to you. But you can't leave. Don't even try. Is your friend a drug dealer too? It's a lot safer for you [GROAN] if you don't ask any questions. Three things can happen with the coke. We dump it. We turn it over to the authorities, who could turn around and finger us to the runners in return for a motherfucker of a pay day. Or get rid of it ourselves for our own pay day. But you would have to deal the drugs to do it. That's done all the time. But not by people like us. Ah. Yeah. You a doctor, miss? Nurse. Keep drinking. Hold onto his legs. Hey, come on. How about it, Jay? About what? How healthy is your bank account, brother? Chick, look. You don't--you don't get rich teaching high school. I know that. That's for sure. I spend all my time making other people money. OK, and I'm wondering, hey, when's it going to be my shot? OK, well. We are criminals if we do anything with this stuff. This looks pretty deep on your shoulder. Just do it. [GROANING] Got it. We have hit the lottery. This chance, it's staring us in the face. But hey, if none of you can see it, then there's nothing I can do to change your minds. This is real surgical thread. You're prepared, aren't you? Yeah, around this place, you better have everything at hand. Yeah, and everybody has a gun. Everybody in Brian's business. But that's not what I'm about. So what do you do? Provide a safe place for friends in trouble. Well, if they're like Brian, you probably have a lot of guests. Hey, Chick can make this work. We are home free. Or we go to jail forever. Jay, come on. Grow some balls for once, man. Really. All right? This is our big chance. All right? And Chick knows how to pull this off. What, do you think he wants to get caught? He's a cop. He's got more to lose than any one of us. He'll sleep till morning. It's a nice job, miss. Does that mean I'm free to go? Brian says you have to stay. Honey, you gotta tell me. I trust Chick's instincts. If he's all right with this, I think we should go with him. Look. You look like you could use a shower and something to eat. You'll become addicted to my cooking. Another addiction. That's just what I need. And this could be just what we've needed. [DOOR OPENING] Are we doing this or what? (LAUGHING) Yeah. [LAUGHTER] Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Whoa! Londono Garcia. It's Denny. Denny, whenever you call, it's not good news. Brian's here. And he's shot up pretty bad. And I don't see no product. You left my men dead. Do you know that? My men dead. And no money to show for it. What do you want me to do? Play host. I will send somebody to take care of this. And Denny, I appreciate loyalty. Thank you, sir. [HORSE NEIGHING] Oh, mami [SPANISH]. You know that you look more beautiful than the last time I saw you, if that is possible. You sounded so distressed, Londono. What's wrong? Business problems, as usual. A simple exchange that turned into a massacre. The meeting took place, and someone got stupid with a gun. My men were killed and the coca disappeared. Who set the meeting? Brian Nathanson was the buyer. I like Brian. I know him. Really? What can I do? I want my coke. Then teach the piece of shit a lesson about loyalties. Slit his tongue or pull his teeth, but send the message. Nobody fucks me. Don't worry. You'll get everything you desire. The way these gringos behave is disgusting. If you make a deal, then you honor it. Hey, wait, wait, wait. What are we-- what are we supposed do next? You gonna-- you gonna brief us or something? (LAUGHING) Brief us. Yeah, buddy. I'm going to brief you when the time's right. Till then, just sit on your ass until I call. OK, Jay? Hey, you know how this is supposed to work, but if you need anything, man, you know I'm right there for you. OK? OK. So what about the money? Well, it might be marked, so I've got to check it. Now listen up. We don't want to make any mistakes. We can't afford to. Just do what I ask. everything will be OK. All right? That's our cue. Come on, tiger. I'll drive Oh no, I got it. You think Chick is going to ask me to carry a gun? Don't be so melodramatic. I'm sure Chick doesn't expect you to be Mr. Macho. Um, did you get a call about Eva? I told you I'm going to deal with that, didn't I Tug? If he thinks we're not up to it, he can cut us out anytime he wants. You know, you got me a little worried here, buddy. Well, we shouldn't have left her, man. And risk one of us going to the authorities? I doubt it. I need someone with a clear head right now, and I'm counting on you. Don't forget what happened in the woods. All right. It's-- it's forgotten. OK? She'll be just fine. Don't go on a shopping spree with my money. Just pull your shit together. [LAUGHING] [SHOUTING] Jim. What's happening, man? Good to see you. All right. Ho ho, look who it is. Hey, Bob. Tell me what you caught, man. Ooh. A college cheerleader and a sea bass with the head the size of a bowling ball. Played them both, and I'm exhausted. Sit down. All right, gentlemen. Let's get this over with as painlessly as possible. This is last week's report submitted by this fine unit, and it is absolute garbage. According to this, not one of you has made progress in a single case. Now, shit flows downhill, from the chief, to the captain, to me, to you. You gotta start making some meaningful callars around here. Lieutenant. Give me three days, and I will deliver you Santos Chabron. Snake's gone underground. Yeah, but I think I can draw him out. I'm going to have to do it solo, but hey, if it works, we call in the troops, and everyone's a hero. Well, look at this. The man's been on vacation, and he's going to be bringing in the best callar. That is something for the rest of you to think about. Now let's go. Chick. Now our necks are sticking way out on this one. You guaranteed me a callar. You worried I might ruin your spotless PR record downtown? You know, I used to have to take that crap both when we were back in uniform. But now that I'm your superior, I'm going to ask you a direct question. Can you make this arrest? Bob, I can deliver you this guy. I know he's hiding out. You let me do my work my way, and I guarantee you you won't be sorry. Well, Chick, as far as I'm concerned, you're going to have an office on the third floor. All right, look. You make good on this Chabron thing, I'll see to it you get your own squad. Man oh man. You know, I don't know why these guys hate you so much. Says who? Shit house wall. What? You can't sleep either? If you move around too soon, you're going to start bleeding again. And I don't think I can handle another operation. Look, it's time for us to go. I don't mean to frighten you, but the people that I was buying from are going to be here soon. They're going to want their coke, which we don't have. Worst case scenario, they send in a sicario. You know what that is? I don't speak Spanish. It means assassin. But they are much, much more than that. The cartels use them to retrieve drugs or money that's been stolen. And to set an example, so others won't be tempted. Can't you just phone the person you're dealing with and tell him what happened? It's too late. Things like this happen fast. K? So the source sends in a sicario at the first sign of trouble. So where did the coke go? I tell you this. You say anything to anyone, and I will reopen this case so fast, your baby brother will be spending the best part of his life behind bars. Are you with me? Eva, the only chance your friends have is me. I don't want anybody killed. I just want the coke back. You killed all those men. They started shooting. You saved me. I want to pay that back. By helping my friends, right? Right. That's why you want to get to them? They're in way over their heads. Hm? You better let me take a look at that. No, after we contact your friends. No, you first. Last thing I need is for you to get an infection you'll never leave. Make your calls. [PHONE DIALING] WOMAN (ON PHONE): - Century Investments. Tug McCan, please. WOMAN (ON PHONE): He's out of the office. When do you expect him back? WOMAN (ON PHONE): He's gone for the day. Just tell him that Eva called, and it's very important that I talk to him. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yes, ma'am. Thanks. Not in his office. Try somebody else. [PHONE DIALING] JAY (ON PHONE): Hello? Jay, it's Eva. I've got to talk to you. JAY (ON PHONE): Eva, are you OK? I'm fine. I'm home. But you and Arlene are in deep trouble. I've got to see you. JAY (ON PHONE): Listen, I'm glad that you're safe, but my talking to you isn't. I'm so sorry, Eva. [DIAL TONE] Well, well well. Didn't know you were still working for Garcia. We all do. Where's Brian? Gone. He took off without even a goodbye. How bad is he hurt? It's pretty bad. He's got a nurse with him. Where did they go? Listen, I took a hell of a risk letting you know that he was here. No, really? Brian would never figure you to sell him out. [CHUCKLING] Ay, Denny, but Senior Garcia appreciates loyalty. The girl left that note. Did you call? Thought I'd leave that up to you. What's wrong with you? You don't keep Brian here. You didn't follow up on this number. That's not my job. I'm not part of your world, beautiful. I offer this place for people to lie down when they need it. You're not feeling tired, are you? No, but I think you are. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [GUNSHOT] [GROAN] I need the address for Doug McCan in Los Angeles. [GASP] God, Arlene. Jesus Christ. What happened to hello? I couldn't see you. I dropped my keys and I bent over to pick them up. I didn't know this much paranoia was required for the job. Paranoia's just a fringe benefit, Arlene. How's Jay holding up? He finally fell asleep early this morning. It's all just a little overwhelming for him. What about you? I think I can handle it. I know I can handle the end result. So is it going to go easy or not? Well, you hope for easy. You prepare for the worst. What are you going to do with your cut? I'm going to take care of my daughter. You know, my wife, she never really accepted having a mentally handicapped kid. That plus being a cop's wife. [LAUGHING] Ooh! Way too much. Way too much. So, hey, she split. But my Karen? She needs to be looked after for the rest of her life. It's not going to be in some public institution like a jail. No, she's going to have the best doctors. She's going to have the best therapists. And the place is going to be-- it's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. If it takes every nickel, it's going to be worth it. Nothing for yourself? Come on, Arlene. You give me a cold beer and a fishing rod, and I'm a happy, happy man. Besides, it's going to be nice not being a cop anymore. [MOANING] Oh! Oh yeah! [LAUGHING] Oh, god. You make me feel good. It's only been building ten years. You ready to go to the next level? What do you mean by that? I want to hide the coke at the gallery. I think we should keep it separated from the cash. I don't know. Shouldn't you hold it? Those scumbags know where I live. I would hate for someone to accidentally find it. I don't want to let you down. You believe me when I tell you something, right? [LAUGHING] Of course. You know why I trust you, honey? Because if you were to run, I'd find you, even if it took a hundred years. I've got to go to work. My god. What the hell do you think you're doing? [STUTTERING] Well, I thought you left me. I called everywhere, and I fell asleep for a while. And then I wake up, and you're still gone. You were dreaming. I am always right here, the dutiful wife. Remember? Yeah, I know. That's what you always say. God, you don't even want me touching you. Not when you're like this. You're a mess. Because I'm having second thoughts. Look, I'm smart enough to be scared. And I know that if we walk through that door, there's no turning back. Chick explained all the risks, and I'm ready to take them. Oh my god. You going into business for yourself? Look at this. He wants me to hold on to the coke until business is done. He's very professional. Chick and I don't need an amateur blowing this. Oh, good, yeah. Are we pros now? Enough to know that-- that you are not supposed to be here. Chick said that nothing in our lives is supposed to change. If you get fired from work, I won't cover for you. I married you. He didn't. You need a shower. Pull yourself together. I have a showing tonight. Ah, whoopdee-fucking-do. Three things can happen with the coke, K? Three things. One, we dump it. We turn it over to the authorities, who can then turn around and finger us to the runners in return for a motherfucker of a pay day. Or get rid of it ourselves, for our own pay day. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on, Carlos. I know how you think. I know where you're at. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Shitting gold bars, man. This is my motherfucking dream. Carlos, what's up? Oh, shit. No, Carlos. Shit. Carlos. Shit. [GROAN] [GROAN] [INAUDIBLE] I didn't do anything, man. [GROAN] What have I told you, Carlos? When you see me, you don't run. You stand, and you fucking salute. You got that? Why don't you just get this thing over? OK, man? Here. I got stuff to do today. Like being a crackhead loser like yourself, right? Your social calendar must be fucking filled. Fuck is, then. If you ain't going to bust me, then I'm just going to-- [GROAN] Listen to me, motherfucker. You So shit for brains and nothing in your wallet, but if you want that to change, just tell me where Santos is. You can't-- you can't afford that, man. How do you know what I got? I know I can get more [INAUDIBLE] asshole cop [INAUDIBLE] kind of bust his ass. Get the fuck up. Get up. Get up. OK, come on. Listen, Carlos. I got some business with your cousin. Now, if you want to get a nice little piece, just tell me where he is. But don't you fucking lie to me, because I will know. How? You super cop powers are going to tell you? No, my man. Just common sense. [GROAN] What's this? What's this, Carlos? I don't know too many people who can lie while their ear's being burnt, Carlos. Where's Chabron? - No! Ow! Ow! Listen. I swear to god, I don't know where he is. Why not? He don't trust me no more. He don't like druggies. I-- I'll help you find him. I'll tell you. [INAUDIBLE] I'll find out. I'll find out. I said get the fuck up. You've known me a long time, Carlos. You know better than to fucking lie to me. Here. It's for you. Tomorrow. Noon. That too. Enjoy. You motherfucker. What, you think you can get away with this? Remember, 12 o'clock tomorrow. I want to see your cousin, Chabron. Eddie. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] fuck my friend. It is all going my way today, Eddie. God loves me. What can I tell you, man? Champagne, please. Eddie. Eddie. Hello. You're very sure of yourself. I thought that smile was an invitation. Was I wrong? I'm Solange Paramos. I'm Tug McCan. Mm, that's priceless, like a little boy trying to be continental. I've never seen anything so clumsily charming. What do you do, Tug? Uh, I'm a commodities broker for now. Your accent is killing me. Where are you from? [INAUDIBLE] Argentina, but I was raised in Brazil. I also deal with investments. Ooh, so what are you? A front? What's that mean? A front is someone who entices millionaires to pour all their money in whatever's hot at the moment. No, Tug. I'm the one who gets the millionaires their millions. Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. It's all right. It's American thinking. Every client is a sucker. Isn't that so? No. In fact, I've put together some pretty sophisticated deals myself. What, a fast food franchise? [LAUGH] [CLUCKING TONGUE] Be careful. This is how little boys end up in prison. That's not going to happen. I have a friend who's a cop. Would you like to come to a party with me? Say yes. We won't stay long, OK? Oh, wow. So these are your business associates? No, um, these are my friends. We're just in business together. Tug. Ah. It's great that you could make it. I didn't think you liked my work that much. Come on, Arlene. I'm a big fan. This is Solange. Tug tells me you did all this. It's wonderful. I love what you do. It's very striking. Thank you. I think I'd like to browse on my own for a while. OK. Maybe I will buy something. See you, baby. Cheers. You're not wasting much time, are you? Hm. So does Chick know you're throwing this little bash? It's not a bash. It's an opening. So I can sell some pieces. I'm an artist, remember? Forget the semantics, Arlene. You're a fucking broke artist. This is coming out of your share, not mine. I'm not cutting up the shares, am I? Excuse me. Mm hm. Thanks. I know you're furious, but I've been planning the show for two months, and you're not paying for any of it. I saved the money myself. I don't care about your money. We're sitting on millions of dollars worth of coke here. What the fuck are you thinking? I'm sorry. I didn't think. It's OK. I'm here to diffuse another bomb. Where is he? Hey, buddy. Hey. How you doing? All right? - How you doing? Good, listen. Uh I think maybe we should have a little talk. What do you say? OK. How many does that make for you? How much. Chick, it's a party. Your wife's worried about you. I bet she is. What about you? You're afraid I'm going to ruin everything? No. 'Cause I know you have a real strength when you've got to use it. You'll come through. But, hey, I can understand you're having second thoughts. Jay, this deal, it isn't what you think it is. None of that coke is ever going to make it to the streets. How? It's going to be sold to the biggest drug dealer in the state. When he hands over his fucking blood money, I'm going to bust him. Then, I'm going to shoot him for trying to escape. Dealer will be dead, and all the coke be handed over to the narco squad. And all you have to do is let it happen, man. Listen to me, Jay. I mean, hey, man, you can start a brand new life, anywhere you want. Anywhere you want. And instead of being a dealer, you help flush one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. Now, can you live with what I told you? It's strange, but I guess this kind of lifts the curse off it. You're a good man, Jay. You're a good man. I'm a good man. Don't know much about art, do ya? No? Well, don't buy any of this shit. Thank you for introducing me to your friends. They are my kind of people. You only met them for a second. It was enough to put their face with their names. Is your cop friend here too? Excuse me. Uh. Yeah. So now I know he looks like too. Yeah. Come on. You want to talk to him? No. I just want to talk to you. Come on. Let's go. Ah! Oh, man. I'm really sorry. Oh. [CHUCKLING] [GIGGLING] Have you been missing me, baby? Yeah, it's been like fucking five minutes. Well, I'm here now. Mm hm. So, tell me everything about your big deals. Mm. Which ones? There's so many. Any one. I think you're someone I can partner with. Yeah? So tell me how you work. OK, I'll tell you this. The only way you can get ahead in business is to really use your balls. [LAUGHING] Ah, that's intriguing. Yeah? So tell me about your deal with the cop. Nah. No, no, no, no. I can't talk about that. No, Chick wouldn't like that. Mm. OK. All right. I'll tell you this, though. I don't mean to brag, but-- but by Friday, I'm going to be swimming in it. Is that when you're going to sell all of Mr. Garcia's cocaine? What? [KNIFE SLASHING] [GASPING] [PHONE RINGING] TUG (ON RECORDING): You've reached Tug McCan. I'm not in. Please leave a message. EVA (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Tug, it's Eva, and I'm back in town. Listen, you and Chick are making a huge mistake. You're in a great deal of danger. You gotta call me as soon as possible, please. I'm also going to call Jay and Arlene. Maybe you're with them. Now what? Get some sleep. Then we're gonna visit some of your friends. I have to go to work in the morning. I miss one more day, and I'm fired. You can go to work, but I need to know where you are at all times. So I'm still kidnapped. I'm just walking around. It's for your own good. WOMAN (ON RADIO): One Adam five. One Adam five. Lieutenant Grant requests your presence at one one four seven West Arizona. This is one Adam five responding, ETA approximately five minutes. So you requested my presence? Yeah, we got a male Caucasian, late 20s. Been dead since about last night. Bob, I'm not in homicide anymore. I thought you should see this. Open it up. Vic's name is Douglas McCan. He's some kind of financial consultant or something. The Gardener found him. Signature killing, huh? So it is. Must of really pissed somebody off. Hey, if he was dealing, I never heard of him. Well, we found a couple of grams of coke in his bedroom, along with some sex toys and a serious porn collection. You don't get a Colombian necktie from being a pussy hound, Bob. Yeah, that's what I thought. So this guy's been playing around in the snow. Figured there's only one guy who could find that out. I want total access. Give me Mr. Party's personal papers, the works. Yeah, you've got it, especially since this is your case now, which you are welcome to. [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [GROANING] [GROANING] Save yourself the pain. Tell me where you've got the coke. I don't know yet. Why? You want it? [SCREAMING IN PAIN] The girl is friends with the thieves. That's why I'm with her. Did you know there was a cop involved? Well-- Of course, you do. That's how you were planning to move the stuff. How long have you and the bitch been planning this game? She is not in this with me. Her friends stole the dope. I don't have the coke or the money. And you're planning to get them through her? I don't want her hurt. You have no say in this, sweetie. Oh, Garcia didn't waste any time sending you in. How'd you find me? Denny? What's the difference? I'm here, and I've got a job to do. Yeah, and Garcia always likes a stack of corpses. You betrayed him, honey. Hey, his guys tried to pull a scam. We called them on it. Then the shooting started. Then the amateurs rolled in. Garcia doesn't care who did what. He's pissed. He wants restitution. And what is he going to say to you when you go back down to see him with nothing? I know he wants me dead. But he wants his coke more. We'll give him his coke. And then you and I can split the buy money. But you claim you ain't got even one, baby. But I can get it, my way. Look, these are stone amateurs. You go rolling in and scare the shit out of them, they're just going to dump the whole shipment in the ocean. Let me work them. Garcia gave me 24 hours. I guess I can give you half that. Yeah. He's expecting to hear from me, so if you have any nasty thoughts. Yeah, I know. I kill you, they'll send an army after me. That's right. So where's your girlfriend? Working? Nice try. Your life is in her hands. I hope she comes through for you. Now, remember, you've got a deal with me. [GASP] Oh, Jesus. Eva, you've gotta be a little more careful, sweetie pie. What the hell do you want? I've come to share some bad news with you about Tug. What about him? Did you talk to anyone about our little adventure in the woods, Eva? What about Tug? Tug's dead, honey. You come here, and you tell me these horrible things just to hurt me. I don't think Tug's dead at all. His throat was slit. And his tongue was pulled. And if you said anything, you killed him, because you turned your back on him. Get out. Leave me alone. Listen to me. If I find out you're lying, next time, I will snap your neck like a twig. Comprendes? Arlene, it's me. Listen. We have a little problem. OK? I've got to take care of a little business. Can't talk to you over the phone. But I want to see you later. The both of you. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Santos is going to be here in five. Good luck. And fuck you. Carlos. You're sticking with me, pal. Where I go, you go. This wasn't part of the deal. That's right. I kept that to myself. When you take me to see your cousin, I want you to be right there. You know, in case he gets nervous, you bringing him a cop and all. Maybe you can calm him down or take the first bullet. This is fucking bullshit, man. You're taking me to see Santos dead or alive, Carlos. Get in the car. Come on. Get in the car. Come on. Get in the car. [MEN SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: Get him! Get him! Come on. Take it easy, boys. Lower your weapons. MAN: What you driving [INAUDIBLE] Come on. [SHOUTING] [BONES CRUNCHING] MAN: Damn. I can't let you do this. Carlos. Ya dejalo. Cool it. The hell did you bring here with you, man? The swat team? You killed us, man. You killed us. Quit crying, woman. This is my place of business, chicalino. I don't allow no assholes here. Then tell your home boys to chill out, or I'll cap you right now, brother. [SPEAKING SPANISH] home boy. Carlos, you bring cop to me? He gave me no choice. Please, Santos, know it. You see what I have to put up with? Yeah. You want to talk a deal or get buried? Talk a deal, brother. Come on in. OK. I took that away from you far too easy, Carlos. [MEN SPEAKING SPANISH] Oh my god. Chico, over here. My god, they'd make me governor if I shut this place down. Right there's good. Open the jacket. What? Lift the shirt. What, you think you're going to find a wire on me, man? You know, your problem is you've been doing business with the wrong people. Me? I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to make a deal. Like you dealt with Carlos? He don't hear so good now. You are a very hard man to get to. You're goddamn right. And now that you know where I am, let me tell you something. I can close this place down in an hour, move to another one just like it across town. Try to bust that, I got another lair. You can drive a goddamn tank through my front door, and it won't stop me. I'm not here to stop you. I just want to know if you can afford what I got. Take a look. Take a look. Mm. Well, it's not bad. What did you do? Rip off the property room? [LAUGHING] Oh, no, no, no. This stuff's from outside, and it is clean. It's a hell of a lot sweeter than not bad. How big? 100 pounds of the purest cocaine you ever buried a nostril in. How you working this? I pick the location. You bring the cash. And I won't take a penny until you are satisfied. Score like that, a guy could get rich. Oh, yeah. What the price? 25 thou' a ki'. [LAUGH] Now I know who's looking to get rich. You know, ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a bad guy. See, I knew who I was. But you carry a badge, man. That's supposed to make you the good guy. Instead, it makes you the biggest dealer in the room. I'll accept one call. It better be from you. You got two hours. I'm out. If you make it back to your car, you'll know I'm interested in your deal. You need to invite some women to this party, brother. Get off the car, home boy. You're going to shoot? At this point, I don't really care. I'm sorry. I was expecting someone else. Um, my, uh stitches. They got pulled. Could you, uh, fix them? Sure. Why not? What happened to your neck? Bill Chickalino came by my work today to tell me that Tug was dead and to stay out of the coke deal. OK, Eva, you have to stop screwing around. Now tell me where the coke is. My friends got the drugs, and I didn't want any more to do with them. I wanted to do the right thing, and it didn't mean shit. You can't help yourself until you get your friends to turn the drugs over. Now, I know that you had nothing to do with the rip-off. But there's a woman in town now, and she loves guns and knives. And she won't believe you. The only way to satisfy her is to give her the drugs and the money. Bill Chickalino means nothing compared to this woman. I don't want to see you hurt anymore. I'm forgetting who you are. How do I know this isn't more lies to get at the drugs? Would Chickalino choke you for no reason? He is afraid. Make a call. Find out why. [PHONE DIALING] WOMAN (ON PHONE): Century Investments. Tug McCan, please. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I'll give you his voicemail. I don't want his voicemail. Let me speak to the office manager. MAN (ON PHONE): Uh, ma'am, Tug McCan died today. Ma'am? Oh, Jesus. MAN (ON PHONE): Hello? [CRYING] Eva, it's not about the cocaine anymore. It's about all of us staying alive until our next birthday. Do you understand? [KNOCKING] TUG: Arlene? Arlene? [BUZZER] Arlene? Arlene? Where is it? Where is it? - It's safe. Did you talk to anyone? No. Did you talk to anyone? Let go of me. I want to talk to Jay. Jay? Jay! Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What-- OK, motherfucker. Who you've been talking to, Jay? Nobody. He wouldn't even feel it. Enough. - OK. - Jesus, Chick. What's wrong with you? You said you couldn't tell us on the phone. What's wrong? We haven't seen or talked to a soul. Tug's dead. Not just dead, but he was executed, which means someone's coming after us. Oh my god. Did you, um, know Eva's back? We, um-- we had a quiet little chat, yeah. I swear, Chick. We didn't say anything to anyone. You know we are really, really close to pulling this thing off, don't you? You know I'm in. What about your husband? What is it, Jay? What is it? Is there something you want to say to me, man? I mean, come on. Mano a mano. What is it? All I'm worried about is making this deal. And I swear to god, if I find out you've been bullshitting me, Jay. Yeah, I'll remember Tug. I didn't do Tug. Now you're going to have two people after you. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. Hey, I got the cash. Can you deliver at 5:30? I'll pick the spot. Just don't pull any cop crap, chico. Or you'll be the first man shot. We're up. Go get it. OK, at five o'clock, you go to address number one. Pick up the guy on the corner. You proceed to address number two. You drop him off. Don't talk. Just drive. Got it? And Jay? If you're having second thoughts, buddy boy, you tell me now. OK? You tell me right now. I got it under control. All right? OK. The exchange is at the Plessarita Canyon oil refineries at 5:30. I left the buy money in the RV. Here's an extra key. If I'm not back by 7:00, that means the whole thing went to shit. I want you to get to my place, take the cash, and leave. Please don't say things like that. Everything's going to go great from now on. Right? You know your husband can blow this whole thing for us with just one phone call. Your job is to bring Jay down off the ceiling, Arlene. Screw his brains out. Reassure him so he keeps his mouth shut for the next couple hours. You with me? Be safe. I'm counting on you. So you found this on McCan's hard drive, huh? Wait. [INAUDIBLE] According to McCan's phone bill, he called him over 10 times last month. Jesus Christ. Chick stood over that dead guy's body and didn't say a damn thing. Uh, look, could you just flag till Monday? I gotta run this by the captain. He's going to want to start an internal investigation. Good job. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Hey, guys. Hi, Mr. Gelb. Jay. Oh my god, Eva. What are you doing here? Mr. Gelb. It's OK. I'm here to help you. OK? Yeah, well, I don't know what you're talking about. Jay, you need to listen to him. Now, what have you gotten yourself into? I feel like they're going to drop a net on me any minute. You don't have a minute. I need to know what Chick is doing with the coke. I can't. Chick is not going to live long enough to spend a dime of that money, and neither is anyone who's working with him. Tell me where and when, or those people that killed tug, they're going to come after you, unless you help me. I'm supposed to go straight from here to pick up the buyer. And I don't know what his name is. After the deal goes down, Chick is going to bust the guy and then come out like a hero in the process. You're doing fine. Can I help you? Oh, hi. It's Solange, right? You're a friend of Tug's. Yes, I am. Can I speak to you for a moment, Mrs. Gelb? I'm on my way out. Please. It won't take long. I said it the other night, but I really think you're very talented. Talented amateur. Well, you put yourself in that category, because you haven't made a lot of money yet. Tug told me you're going to be very rich, very soon. What are you going to do with all that stolen money? Oh my god. Tell me about your friend, the cop. You already know an awful lot. That you're thieves and liars, yes, but not what you're doing with the coke. Where is it? It's not here. [GLASS SHATTERING] I can play like this all day long. It keeps me in shape. Mrs. Gelb, this is your last chance to make a deal. Do you have a weapon with you? If you don't say anything, I have to assume that you do. That means I have to protect myself. [GUNSHOT] You're not made for this, my dear. Tell me about the deal. (PANTING) Oil refinery. Plessarita Canyon. 5:30. God Am I dying? No. I only shot to wound. It's a talent I have. [GUNSHOT] [GASP] [GROAN] Now that's a kill shot. Hey, Chick. Sit. I-- I know you're not putting in for overtime, because I'm not going to approve that. [LAUGHING] Hey, after I deliver you Chabron, I'll be running this place. Ho, ho, ho, ho. So how's that coming? Good, good. Going to have a break real soon. Yeah? Any idea when that'll be? Not long. I thought you were going to let me run this my own way, Bob. Well, it's always good to sort of, you know, hash this shit out over a couple of beers. You know? I mean, who knows? I might even help you nail him. You need this bust, Chick, now. What the hell are you talking about? The captain is looking into you and this McCan thing, you having a close relationship with a homicide victim and then not saying anything about it. I mean, you know how that looks. You think I had something to do with the killing? Of course not. But you are guilty of withholding evidence, now, aren't you? They could have your badge. You worried about me, Bob? Or the rep of your squad? You know, one cop does not like to see another cop with his nuts in a vice, Chick. So if you can make this Chabron thing work out, I'm sure it'll go down really well with internal affairs when they start poking around. And they will be poking. I'm going to make this bust. Today. Maybe I should stick with you. That way, I can verify your actions, you know, for the record. It's always nice to have another gun around. Isn't it, Chick? Give me a couple hours to call. Then you can bring in swat and the whole fucking army, if you want. That's exactly what I'm going to do. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Buena dia, preciosa. I haven't heard from you. Now, you know how is papi. He gets worried if he doesn't hear from his child. You're not my papi, and I'm not your child anymore. But everything is going well. I've even seen Brian, and he's agreed to turn over the coke, if we let him live. You know that's impossible. Well, I need you to say it. Everything is set up by today, and I'll be in the first plane back to you. I can't wait to see you. You can't wait to see your money and your coca. Ciao, papito. [CHUCKLING] So what happens now? Do you shoot everybody? You know better than that. Am I still your prisoner? No. Now you're just an interested party. Look, Eva, I'm sorry how this all happened to you. But you did the right thing. Now you can go back to your old life, as if none of this has happened. No, I can't. I don't know what I'm going to do, but it's not going to be my old life. [VEHICLE STARTING] [INAUDIBLE] kill him. Where's Chickalino? I'm going to take you to him. Load up. No, no, um. Your friends can't come. Oh, these aren't friends. These are motherfuckers who'd love to blow your motherfucking head off. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Um, we have a problem. Put on Chabron. Is there a problem? CHABRON: Oh, yeah, there's a problem. Yeah, what do you think, I'm a fucking fool? I don't go alone. Let me tell you something. The only reason you're not in county being deloused right now was because of me. OK? Now, if you're not up to this, maybe I should find someone to do business with who has a set of balls on him. And besides, what are you pissing about, Chabron? Does my guy look like a hitter to you or what? I swear, if you fuck me, your whole bloodline is dead. So who the hell are you? Another fucking cop? No, I'm just an innocent bystander. Bullshit, nobody's innocent. Thanks for the ride, tough guy. Leave the keys. This way. Come on, Santos. What's with this homie bullshit, man? Leave him be. Come on. I feel better with a shield. All right. Let's see what you got? Hey, I'm holding up my end, man. No tricks. Just business. Well, I got to check out the merchandise, as agreed. It's a matter of not fucking each other. Couldn't have put it better myself. You can have a fiesta with this shit, if you like. Just make it fast. OK? Move. Right there. I'd like to trust you, my friend, but, like my daddy always said, you can't even trust yourself. You'll poke yourself in the eye and bite your own tongue. How you holding up, buddy? I'm good. This is old shit to him. He's a bad motherfucker, right? Heh? [CHUCKLING] OK, jefe. You've got it. Give it to Jay. Jay, give me a look at that, will you? [GUNSHOTS] Pull it together, brother. Pull it together. Come here. We still got a lot to do. [GUNSHOT] Jay! God. [GUNSHOT] BRIAN: Chickalino! [GUNSHOTS] You listen to me very carefully, whoever the hell you are. This deal has nothing to do with you. So get the hell out. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] Ah! You have no right to this deal. My friends died for this chance. This is ours. You hear me? Your friends died, because you're a greedy asshole. And you call yourself a cop. [GUNSHOT] Who the hell are you? [GUNSHOT AND SCREAM] DEA. Face down on the ground. Face down for the DEA? That ain't never going to happen, brother. I'm not going to ask you again. Then do it! Shoot me. [GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS] I always liked you, Brian. Idiota. Put your hands up. Fuck you, sweetheart. So blow my head off. No. Why? You are the big connection here. You've got the cash and the fucking cocaine. Why don't you kill me and be done with it? 'Cause your bosses wouldn't like it? No, they'd be thrilled with your corpse. But they want Garcia. And you're going to be an excellent prosecution witness. You are under arrest. I first met you five years ago. Is that how long you've been undercover? I don't remember. Cuff yourself. You lost yourself. One day you're an agent. Another you're a killer and a dealer. Funny how that works, isn't it? At least I knew what side I was on. [KNIFE THROW AND GUNSHOT] [GROAN] [SIRENS] Thanks for the call. I'm sorry your man was involved. You turn in the cocaine and the cash. It's your case now. Wait a minute. You can't walk out on a federal investigation. Hey! Hey, Nathanson, come on. You can't leave me holding this. It's going to take us 10 years to sort this out in court. Hey! You're the last person I thought I'd ever see again. Ah, there's a lot I need to explain to you. Things that I couldn't say before. Maybe you can give me the chance. My flight's at 10:00. Take a later one. I'll even pay for it. Come on in. You can tell me the story of your life. The real one. [MUSIC PLAYING]
