[gasps] Whoa, whoa. Uh... Whew. Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Wow! I did it, Honey. I escaped a giant Chelsea-eating flower, and got a ride from a butterfly. And I didn'’t spill a single drop. [Otto]: What do you care if you spilled water for a mangy old dog? Otto! Were you listening to me? It'’s not my fault I live next door. What were you doing on that tree anyway? Practicing my balance. I heard, in first grade, you have to carry lunch trays and lots of books. I'’m gonna spend all summer working on a list of things I can'’t do yet. Huh. Like what? Like not being scared of thunderstorms and sleeping without a light on, and-- Kid stuff. I plan to fly with a real-live jet pack, and toast 1,001 marshmallows. Way more exciting than climbing an old tree. For your information, Otto, this tree is really a boat that takes me to magical places. You still play make-believe, and believe in magic? Ha ha. That'’s funny. What? Don'’t listen to Otto. The question should be: Who doesn'’t believe in magic? I mean, where would the world be if people didn'’t believe in magic or play make-believe? There would be no tablets or rovers on Mars or... chocolate chip cookies. All those were discovered by magic? Not quite, but they were all the unknown ones until a smart, imaginative person went on to invent them. People who thought about the impossible and made it possible or real. Which is why you shouldn'’t worry about Otto, and you should keep on believing in magic. Really, Barbie? Yes! Who knows what you'’ll discover? Besides, I bet Otto wishes he had your imagination, and that'’s why he teases you. And speaking of cookies, I got a text from Stacie asking us to send a box to camp of her fave... [both]: Butterscotch peanut butter chip! I miss Stacie and Skipper already. Me, too. This might help. It'’s a memory box. Ah, Skipper'’s daisy head band. Stacie'’s rainbow swim goggles. A candy necklace? And your pink quartz rock! Aw, thank you, Barbie. You'’re welcome, and you can add your own memories this summer. Ready for our story? What'’s it about tonight? I'’m thinking... [gasps] a unicorn. Ooh! Can it have wings? [gasps] And fly? [laughs] Yes. Of course the unicorn has wings. I mean, it does live in the clouds. [yawns] Don'’t forget a castle. [grunts] Fetch! Good dog. Bring it back. Honey, I said bring it back. -[bell rings] -[horn honks] Chelsea! You know how we'’re going to Fun Days in two days? And how there'’s a bicycle race, but we'’re never old enough to be in it? Well, guess what? Zoie signed us up! All three of us! Jace, I wanted to tell her! We'’re finally old enough! And guess what the prize is? A trampoline! Jace! Why aren'’t you saying anything? Um... it'’s just so... Awesome! Let'’s go practice bike riding right now. Good idea! Chelsea, go get your bike. Um, I can'’t. I have to... give Honey a bath. Arr? [whimpers] Okay. See you at Fun Days. -[bell rings] -[horn honks] Sorry, Honey, but I was too embarrassed to tell my friends that I still can'’t ride a bike without training wheels. [whimpers] You know what? I'’m gonna tell them the truth. [horn honks] That'’s a very terrible idea. Otto! Why are you always everywhere? It'’s not my fault I'’m a man on the go. Now, on the day of the race, pretend you'’re sick. Tell everyone just the thought of riding a bike makes you throw up. I'’m not gonna do that. I love Fun Days. I'’m going to that race. Fine with me, but I bet you'’re never going to ride that bike without training wheels. Never. [Barbie]: I can'’t believe we finally get to be in charge of Fun Days. It'’s a huge responsibility. That'’s why I think we need to keep the traditions like the bike race. [Derek]: Check. I'’ve already mapped out the course in four amazing zones. Since you'’ve won every year since we were six, I'’m not surprised. Okay, what about concession stands? Let'’s go classic. Pink lemonade. Ooh, and those giant swirl lollipops. Love it! And, hmm, what else? Maybe a soap bubble race, a mermaid photo booth? -A glitter rock hunt-- -[laughing] Okay, so I'’ve been coming up with ideas for a while. Ha! Like years. Totally. And you know what the best part is? -We get to wear costumes in the costume parade! -[Chelsea sneezes] -Whoa! -Wait. We'’re doing that? Of course! It'’s tradition for the committee to wear costumes, too. Hey, Chels. Everything okay? Uh, sure. Uh, I'’ll talk to you later. Hey, guys, let'’s pick this up again tomorrow. Two cups of hot chocolate with marshmallows. I'’m also afraid to ride without my training wheels, but I don'’t want anyone to think I'’m a baby. Don'’t worry, Chelsea. We can practice tomorrow. You'’ll be riding on your own in no time. That'’s for the Fun Days parade. Can you guess what I'’m going to be? A unicorn? Pretty obvious, huh? I don'’t know what it is about me and costumes. I just love dressing up. Skipper says it'’s because you'’re still a kid at heart. I hope so. Forever. You are tired. Sounds like it'’s time for a story. And then, the winged unicorn flew over the castle and the clouds, finally free. The end. Try not to worry about the bike race. Night. Sweet dreams. [Otto]: You'’re never going to ride that bike without training wheels. [echoing] Never. [gasps] Wow! [Honey howls] Wow! Whoo-hoo! [gasps] Those are marshmallows. We'’re riding in hot chocolate! Whoa! [laughs] Pink lemonade! Honey, where are we? Barbie? I'’m the Sugar Spun Fairy, and you'’re in Sweetville. Hmm, I'’d say you have about three seconds before your boat goes over Lemonade Falls, so... I have wings? How did you do that? It'’s a fairy thing. Follow me. Cupcake houses. Strawberry chairs? You can lick the grass. It'’s lemon lime. Everything here is made of something sweet. Oh, yes. Like my sculpture. I call it "Fruitacular Mother and Child." Mm-hmm! I see it. Um, I think. [humming] Well hello there, new comer. Would you like an ice cream treat? Sure! Oops. [chuckles] My ice cream treats have melted faster than a snow cone man on a summer'’s day. [chuckles] Well, you could use your melted ice cream to fill the moat at Candy Castle. Great idea, Sugar Spun Fairy. [humming] So, what do you think of Sweetville? I love it, but I don'’t really know why I'’m here. Well I always figure things out on a walk, and I know the perfect place. A lollipop forest! I can'’t wait to tell my sister Barbie about this. She loves magical things, too. Huh. She sounds very wise. Last night, she told me an amazing story about a winged unicorn. Wait. You know about the Winged Unicorn? The famous Winged Unicorn? You mean, it'’s... real? Yes, but I'’ve only heard about it in stories. They say it'’s wild, but whoever rides it will be filled with magic forever. Whoever rides the unicorn. [breathing heavily] Sugar Spun Fairy! Oh, terrible news. Our creations are being destroyed! Stay calm, Chocolate Bunny. Tell me everything you'’ve heard. That'’s the problem. Look at my ear. They must have done it while I slept. -[barking] -Honey, come back! Go tell everyone to stand watch over their creations. Chelsea and I will find out who'’s doing this. Got it. Good plan. I have a feeling whoever ran off is the culprit. Let'’s go. Run all you want, Chelsea, because you'’ll never ride that winged unicorn. Never! [laughs] Hmm. Honey lead us to the Candy Caves where the bears live. -Bears? -Yes. Strawberry Bears. But they sleep during the day, so why was one out in the forest? We better find out. Hmm. I know. [gasps] Bears love gingerbread. [loudly] Whoo! What is this great, big gingerbread house doing in front of this cave? Did you say ginger? [sniffing] Coming through! [all]: Wow! As you can see, we get extra hungry when we hibernate. Is this why some of the sweet creations in the village have gone missing? Well, we might have taken a bite or two. [muffled] Mmm. Just a nibble. -We'’re sorry. -Oh, so sorry. -Sorry about that -We'’re very sorry. [whispering] Um, is anyone gonna eat that jelly bean roof? Now that you know the Strawberry Bears were just really hungry and didn'’t mean any harm, we think we'’ve come up with a solution. Chelsea? We thought you might like to make some creations just for the bears. [all exclaiming] Oh, I have an idea. Let'’s see here. [humming] Like this all marshmallow sculpture called, "Strawberry Bear Thinking". [all agreeing] Or a Luscious Lava Dam. Sticky caramel goodness for the bears. The mind reels with possibilities. So it'’s settled. You'’ll make extra sweet treats, and the Strawberry Bears agree to nibble at night and sleep by day. [all cheering] Sorry to rain on this sweet parade, but if that'’s the case, what'’s that Strawberry Bear doing over there poking around that candy necklace wall in broad daylight? [Honey barking] Ah! That'’s no Strawberry Bear! You are correct. I am a prince from, uh, far away. You are not a prince. Chelsea is also correct. My name is the Notto Prince. You may bow. Welcome to Sweetville, Notto Prince. What brings you hear so far from home? I am on a quest to find the Winged Unicorn, and I just spotted some unicorn tracks. What? Those are real unicorn tracks. I told you so, and I am going to find it first. But why? Because it'’s, uh... on my list. I need to go after him. And you will. Close your eyes. Um, [giggles] just Chelsea. I-I knew that. My fairy wings will get you back to your boat and your next destination if you believe in magic. Thank you, Sugar Spun Fairy. I do believe in magic. Goodbye, Strawberry Bears! Goodbye, everyone! -Bye! -Bye, Chelsea! -See you later! -We'’ll miss you! Huh? Mmm. -[barks] -Honey, you'’re here. We'’re back in our room. [gasps] So Theresa doesn'’t wanna wear a costume in the parade? Why? She says "We'’ll look like kids." We are kids! Hang on, Nikki. I'’m getting another call. Hey, I'’ve been thinking about the whole costume thing, and, uh, [laughs] while I like a superhero costume as much as the next guy, it'’s sort of... kid-like. Hey, Chelsea. No offense. Okay. Call you back. Derrek'’s out, too. Let'’s talk later. Barbie, how can I learn how to ride a bike in the rain? Hopefully it'’ll stop soon. I hope so. You know, I was having a really fun dream, and I think you were in it. Why don'’t you sleep a little bit more and see how that dream ends? I am kinda tired. What were you guys talking about? Fun Days. Some of my friends don'’t wanna wear costumes. [laughs] You know, you got some pretty serious bed head going on here. How does hair get like this when you'’re sleeping? It just does. Sometimes I think hair has a mind of its own. [chuckles] Barbie, you could still be a unicorn at Fun Days... right? Hmm. [gasps] -[Honey whimpers] -[gasps] Whoa! Huh? We'’re on top of a forest! [horse galloping] Horses! Or maybe a unicorn. Honey, we'’ve got to get down there. [grunting] [man]: Ouch! Who said that? The thing your boat'’s scraping on. Leafy, pink, strong. Woops, uh, sorry. Uh, I hope I didn'’t hurt you. Could you help me get down to the bottom of the forest? Sure. Here you go. Whoa! -[giggles] -[giggles] -[gasps] -That tickles [giggles] Excuse me, but where am I? Ooh, a visitor! Do you have a hair clip? Get it? Hair clip? [chuckles] Because I'’m a rabbit, and because I love doing things with my hair! [chuckles] Sorry. I don'’t, but it looks very nice. Thank you! Truth is, anyone could have gorgeous hair here in Wispy Forest. Wispy Forest? Everything'’s made out of hair! Except for the Mountains of Mousse. [Chelsea]: Whoa! You mean those mountains are made entirely out of-- Mousse! Hair mousse! That'’s how I got my hairdo to, you know, do. [giggles] Wow! I know, and look over there! [Chelsea]: Are those made out of giant combs? Ah, yes, but sometimes the job is best done with a smaller comb. Herberto! is that any way to say, "hello" to a new friend? Please, pardon my husband. He can'’t resist showing off. I'’m Hazel. This is Herberto. I'’m Chelsea, and this is Honey. This seems like the kind of place the Winged Unicorn would live. Oh, yeah. Room to roam, endless hairstyles. All kinds of unicorny things to do. Well, we'’ve never seen one with wings before, but that doesn'’t mean it'’s not here. Aw, I heard hoof beats and thought I saw a horse running. [whistles] That was Delia. She'’s a horse, but makes her hair look like a horn. Don'’t say I said anything. It'’s a touchy topic. -[whinnies] -Delia! Chelsea thought you were a Winged Unicorn. Sorry. No wings, all horn. I love unicorns! It'’s just, I'’m looking for this particular one. The famous Winged Unicorn. [gasp] I know who could find it! The Forest Princess! Jonah! I wanted to tell her! She'’s at Shampoo Falls right now with the Princess Tribe. I'’ll take you there. [giggles] Climb on. [laughs] Thank you, Chelsea. You'’ve once again led me one step closer to victory! [gasps] There they are! [Jonah]: They'’re bubble riding! [all giggling] [gasps] Ah. [all]: Princess. Ah, Princess, your hair is as lovely as ever. Barbie? Hi. I'’m the Forest Princess. Oh. Okay, well, hello. I love your hair. Thank you. It'’s how I was feeling when I saw you coming out of the forest. What do you mean? Our hairstyles express our emotions. Like when we'’re bubble riding, we feel adventurous. -And strong. -And fearless. Your hair can show all that? Sure. Watch. If I'’m feeling silly... or creative... or fashionable. Yay! I wish I could try. You can! Just think about what you want to express. Wow! -[all exclaiming] -Ooh, determination. You must have something important on your mind. Oh, she does. -She'’s trying to find-- -The Winged Unicorn. Jonah! Ugh. Princess! There'’s a Mopple heading this way! [all scream] What'’s a Mopple? Someone having a really bad hair day. Goodbye! It'’s okay, everyone. We just need to talk to the Mopple. [all three]: You'’re right. [grunting] [whimpering] It'’s okay, Honey. It'’s just hair. Ha! I'’m mad hair. There is a difference. I'’m messy, choppy, straggly, shaggy, and spiky. And don'’t forget tangled into knots. Hey! Mopple, you need to calm down. I don'’t wanna calm down, because then I might not be mad anymore. And it'’s better to be mad, than-- [cries] Too late. Now I'’m sad. [crying] I was sad, too, when I thought I wouldn'’t be able to ride in the bicycle race with my friends. What'’s a bicycle? I think it'’s a pony with six legs. How did you get over being sad? Well, I decided to find the Winged Unicorn and ride it. Can you help me? -Of course. It lives in-- -[Notto]: Wait. I am the Notto Prince, and I command you to tell me first. In fairness, Chelsea did ask me first. You know my name? Lucky guess. Take Chelsea away. Grrr. You can'’t tell me what to do! I got this, Mopple. Here'’s what I know. The Winged Unicorn lives in another world not far from here, but you need sparkle dust to even get close. Sparkle dust? Don'’t bother, Chelsea, because I'’m going to capture that unicorn and keep it all to myself. Oh! [sniffs] [sighs] Shampoo flowers. [giggles] Oh, my favorite. Get back here! I'’m still mad! Wait! We can help you! We take appointments! I put the unicorn in danger. I need to go after him right away. Then there'’s only one way to go... [all three]: Bubble riding! Get ready to jump! [Forest Princess]: Now! [giggles] Wow! Thank you, Princess! Goodbye, Locksley. Goodbye, Jonah. Goodbye, everyone! -Goodbye, Chelsea! -Bye, Chels! Huh? What? [Barbie]: Good morning, sleepyhead. It'’s still raining, but we can practice bike riding on the porch if you want. Are you sure about this, Barbie? Completely. It'’s a new way to learn how to ride a bike. First, you learn balance by using your feet to scoot along. When you'’re used to that, you'’re ready to pedal. Wanna try? [whimpers] Uh... whoa! [grunts] Are you okay, Chelsea? I'’m okay. What do you think? Oh, it'’s perfect! Thank you. I was hoping it would cheer you up. I think I'’ll just go to Fun Days and not ride in the race. Okay, but things might seem different in the morning. Chels, riding a bike is a little like believing in magic, but the magic is inside of you. You create it. You have to believe that you can do it. Believe that the bike won'’t fall down even though that seems impossible. Hey, let'’s have a sleepover tonight! Right here in the living room. Ah, my pink quartz rock. That somehow always brought me luck. Mmm? Huh? I don'’t know where we are, Honey, but I have a feeling we should be very, very quiet. [loudly] It'’s so sparkly! [gasps] Whoa! [grunting] [gasps] Our boat! Oops. Are you okay? I didn'’t mean to do that. I'’m still working on my magic, but I'’m sure I can get your boat back... pretty sure. [nervous chuckle] Hi. I'’m the Sparkle Mountain Princess. I'’m Chelsea, and this is Honey. You know, you look a lot like my sister. [gasping] You'’re magic! [giggle] Working on it. Right now, I'’m just an apprentice at Sparkle Mountain Academy, magic queens in training. I was just heading back to Crystal Castle. Would you like to come? Sure, but isn'’t it awfully far? Don'’t worry. I know a shortcut. Follow me, and by "follow," I mean, "stay right there." [gasps] Huh, that totally worked! Come on. I'’ll show you around. Go! You know the plan. [Notto cackles] It'’s beautiful! I know, but things aren'’t always what they seem around here. Like this. Something so pretty inside a plan old rock? Crazy, huh? [girls giggling] That'’s Amethyst and Cobalt, my best friends. They'’re picking gem stones for our gowns to wear in the Glitter Parade. [gasps] Where did they go? They must have imagined themselves somewhere else. It'’s one of the first things we learn. -[barks] -[cat screeches] [Chelsea chuckles] She'’s just playing. Honey loves cats. A funny way of showing it. Oh, my apologies, Sparkle Princess. I didn'’t see you there. Hello, Melky. We have guests. This is Chelsea and her dog, Honey. The mutt I'’ve met. Castle cat at your service. What a pretty necklace. Does it contain... sparkle dust? As a matter of fact, it does. [gasps] Really? That'’s why I'’m here, to get some sparkle dust. [sighs] Let me guess. You want to shrink yourself to see what it would be like to live in a doll house. Sparkle dust does that? Sparkle dust can do all kinds of things. It'’s only limited by your imagination. Will it help me get close to the Winged Unicorn? Yes. Will it? They say that it will, but first you have to find the unicorn. [gasps] And I think I know where to look! Follow me. I mean, here we go. Bye, Melky. No one ever thinks to invite the cat. The other day, I saw some silver dust right... here. They say the Winged Unicorn shakes silver dust from its mane when it'’s running. We just have to follow the trail. But a unicorn could never fit through there. But you said things aren'’t always as they seem around here. Could it have walked through the wall? My sister Barbie says unicorns are magical. Smart, but unfortunately, I haven'’t learned how to do that yet. But there'’s always another solution to a problem. [both]: [gasp] Sparkle dust! [barks] We must be underneath the Peaks of Peridot. There'’s more silver dust. And look! Hoof prints. That'’s because the unicorn was here. And I, the Notto Prince, witnessed it. So hand over that necklace, Chelsea. No! You'’ll use the sparkle dust to catch the unicorn! Of course. What else? Melky. What? You'’re helping him? He promised to make me a royal advisor. That'’s way better than castle cat. He'’s not even a real prince. Don'’t listen to her. Pounce! Ha! Got '’em. Hmm. [Sparkle Princess]: We'’re right in front of you! [Chelsea]: [giggles] Try to catch us now! Hmm. The Princess must have imagined them invisible. Impressive. Most impressive. It'’s not impressive! Find them! You do know what "invisible" means, don'’t you? [both]: Bye, Notto Prince. [chuckle] Mmm. Uh, Prince. The girl dropped this. [grunts] Hmm. That'’s the last time I help anyone. Princess, we heard you were looking for the Winged Unicorn. You can use the reflecting pool to find out where it lives. But we haven'’t learned that yet. If anyone can do it, you can. -Huh? -[huffing and puffing] He'’s got my necklace! We have to find the unicorn before he does. We'’ll find it. You two, hold off the Notto Prince. I won'’t know until I try. Whoa. Whoa. Ha. There'’s the unicorn! It'’s flying through clouds and a rainbow! Rainbow Cove! Sorry. He slipped by us. I have to go after him right away. But how do I get to Rainbow Cove Kingdom? I don'’t have any sparkle dust. I'’m not magic. But you have inner strength. Whenever you wanna get to the Kingdom, you just have to focus and believe, and you'’ll get there even if you'’re awake. Whoo-hoo! Yay! Thank you, Princess! Thank you, Amethyst and Cobalt! -Goodbye! -Buh-bye! See you later! You were talking in your sleep. You must have been having a nightmare. No, it was a dream. Wait, what are you doing here? Barbie had to go to Fun Days early, so she called my mom to come over and make you breakfast. [Otto'’s Mom]: Otto, let Chelsea sleep, and come help me with the pancakes. So, uh, you ready for the race? You bet I'’m ready. How '’bout you, Otto? I have to go. Mom'’s making pancakes. [giggles] Chelsea, where have you been? The race is about to start. I had to put my training wheels back on. I haven'’t learned to ride a bike yet without them. I was afraid to tell you. Why? I just took my training wheels off a few months ago. And I can'’t ride very fast. I am so going to win this race. Hi, Chels. Ready to race, everyone? -Ready! -I'’m ready. And... you'’re off! [crowd cheering] Go, Chelsea. Focus and believe. [crowd cheering] [grunting] I'’m not sure we should be here. It'’s okay. Come with me. Yeah! There'’s nothing like a swim in the Rainbow Pools. Well, it does look like fun. Okay. Come on, Honey. Wow! You'’re mermaids! Wait, I'’m a mermaid! It'’s so much easier to swim if you'’re a mermaid. And I can talk under water. Did you hear that, Honey? Honey? [muffled barks] [giggles] I like this place already. ♪♪ We sing all day we sing all night ♪♪ ♪♪ We sing in color not black and white ♪♪ ♪♪ We sing all day we sing all night... ♪♪ So you'’re not mermaids on land?

Hold on, Princesses. Four, five, six. [gasps] Someone'’s missing! [all]: Pink! Sorry, but this time I have a major excuse. I just heard that the Rainbow Princess is on her way. She'’s coming here? Yes, to see us! There she is! [all]: Wow! So it'’s true? You still ride the rainbows? Every chance I get. It'’s always been one of my favorite things to do. Hello, Chelsea. I heard you were coming, and you two, Honey. I have serious news, everyone. The Winged Unicorn has been captured by someone claiming to be a prince. [all]: No! He must have used the sparkle dust! We may not have sparkle dust, but we have the power of unity. Ready to ride the rainbows, everyone? [all]: Ready!

I thought they were just rain drops. They are, but in Cloud Canyons, the rain drops are magic. You can'’t break through them. Nice try, Chelsea, but the Winged Unicorn is not going anywhere. If you'’re inside this cage, you can open it. You need to let the unicorn go free. -No. -[all gasp] You can'’t say, "no" to the Rainbow Princess. Yes I can. I am the Notto Prince. Wait, is he saying he'’s not a prince? That'’s what I thought he said. Ugh. My name is the Notto Prince. And I can say, "no" to the Rainbow Princess because... I can'’t open this cage. I lost the key. I'’m stuck here. There'’s only one thing that might open that cage: teamwork. Princesses, you bring out all your color powers to make a beam of light. Chelsea, you ride with me, and we'’ll direct their light into the keyhole of the lock. Remember, everyone, we have to work together. -Got it! -Let'’s go! [whinnying] [coughing] Wow!

And look, your training wheels weren'’t even touching the ground. I rode without training wheels? Barbie, it feels like magic to ride a bike. Congratulations, Chelsea! Way to go! I can'’t believe I won! You did... this year. Time for everyone to get in their costumes. Awesome bike course, Derek. And everyone loves the new attractions. Success. [chuckles] Makes me want to be a kid again. I don'’t think being a kid ends when we grow up. Why not have that magic all our lives? So, I gotta go. I have a unicorn costume to put on. You mean this unicorn costume? [laughs] -Hey, nice costume. -Thanks, but I like yours best. Well, you inspired me to wear it and our stories, of course. [grunting] Come on, Honey. We'’re almost there. -[barks] -Come on, Chelsea. Just because you won the bike race doesn'’t mean that you can make it all the way to the top of that tree. [Chelsea]: Of course I can, Otto, but it isn'’t a tree. This is the cliff at Shampoo Falls, and I'’m nearly at the top! Come on. Can'’t you see it? Look over there. It'’s the Fair Haired Forest.
