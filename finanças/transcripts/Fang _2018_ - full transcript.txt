Get the fuck up! What's wrong? I said get the fuck up! What's wrong, Joe? We don't have any score left, and I'm out of money. What do you want me to do? We need to find some. Babe, can't we just find some tomorrow? It's late. I talked to Rich. He's got some. And where do you want me to find the money for it? And I already have Rich on an IOU. He's not just gonna sell to us when we already owe him. Then we'll just have to fucking rob someone! Where did you get that? Don't worry about it. Look, listen, listen, listen. You're gonna go lure some dumb fuck, and I'm gonna come at 'em. It's pretty simple. And how do you want me to lure some guy in? Spread your fucking legs. Hey, baby. Wanna party? How much to party? How much you got? What, not interested? Yeah, let's take a ride. So how about we skip the fucking negotiating and you take off your clothes, or I'll kill you right where your pretty little ass is planted! No, stop. Your pants first. Shit, shit, shit. Chloe, this motherfucker's only got 50 bucks. Shit! What the fuck happened to her? It's been a shit day. It's her period, man. Chris, who the hell is at the door this late at night? Listen, Christmas, I need some score. You still haven't paid me back from last time and... How should I have known it was this piece of shit. Look, Chris isn't doing this shit anymore. And besides, you owe him from the last time. Baby, baby, I got this. Chris, don't baby me. You said you were done with this. Joe, you and your friend need to turn around and get the hell up out of my house right now. Chris, say goodbye to your friends. Bye. Chris, I said say goodbye to your friends! Look, I didn't see this scumbag giving us the money that he owed us when we needed it the last time. What makes you think he's gonna give it to us now? Baby, he's only gonna use you. Why can't you get that through your thick skull? I'm fine. Please, can you help us? Alright, I'll help you, Chloe. But I won't help that piece of shit you run with. Here, that's all I got, man. Thanks, Christmas. What's wrong? I'm just, I'm just thinking. Thinking about what? You know, I went to MCC. I graduated with honors. And today, today, I robbed a man and I killed a man so that I could get high. We'll figure it out. Why don't we just leave this place, you know, get outta here and... Where are we gonna go? Where the fuck are we gonna go? I have some family up in Metsburgh we can go visit. It's actually the last bit of my family I have left. I haven't seen them since I was really little, but they lived in a secluded house in the middle of nowhere. I really think you're overthinking it, babe. I mean no one even knows we were there. We got away with it. Why don't we just sleep it off tonight, and tomorrow's a new day. Yeah, maybe you're, maybe we should take a trip. Tell me about your family. To be honest I don't even really know what they're like anymore. I haven't seen them since I was a little girl. But my Aunt Doris, she was my mom's sister. All I can remember is that they were rich but they lived... Rich? Yeah. My mom used to say that they had enough money to buy a village. Interesting. What? That you have family that you've never talked about. You're right, we should go. We should go on a trip. Yeah? I'd love to take you to meet the Crowleys. Hello, friends. What seems to be the problem? Well, friend, there seems to be a blown head gasket. I'm Joe. This is Chloe. We've got a cellphone. You can use it if you like. Already tried that. No cell signal. You guys from around here? No, just outside of Burton. Yeah, like a million miles from here. We saw a road sign back there, but I'm not sure. Metsburgh. Metsburgh? Chris, where the hell is that? Do you guys have a map? GPS. Well, I have a map, and you're welcome to look at it if you'd like. Yeah, I mean what is there to lose? Shelly, what do you say? Alright. Shit! What? I can't find my hair clip. What hair clip? The one my mom gave me when I was younger. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Where are we now? Great. Yeah, I'd say you're about 30 miles out from Charlotte. 30 miles, Chris? No signal. We're stranded. I wouldn't say we're stranded. Relax. I mean these folks are out here, right? So clearly, we're not that stranded. Chloe's got family just up the road. We're headed there now. You guys are welcome to tag along. I'm sure her aunt's got a phone you guys could use. Okay, sure. Uh, Chris, let's not be so hasty. I am sure that Joe and Carrie here... Chloe. Chloe, don't want us interrupting or intruding. No, it's good. We're happy to help. Yeah, you see, perfect. We'll go to her aunt's house, we'll call your father, we'll be at the wedding before sundown. Folks, could you just excuse us for one second. Okay, Shelly, what's the problem? I just don't think that we should put all of our faith into these two people that look like strung out junkies. Daddy wouldn't... Daddy what? This kid's a stick. No, he's more like a twig. If he tried anything, I'd break 'em. I mean seriously, he looks like he wouldn't even hurt a fly. Chris, if anything happens to me, my father... Your father what? Shelly, we've been dating for four or five months. You gotta start trusting me at some point. Come on. Let's not be rude. How much longer already? We've been walking forever. Relax. You know, you're gonna have to try to figure out a way to make this up to Charles. Oh, I know. I mean how often do you miss your best friend's wedding? I told you you should have let me take my car. But no, "My car will make it," you say. Well, look what good your car has done for us now. We're stranded with people that very well may be rapists - or murderers. - Shelly! Jesus, they'll hear you. And don't think for one second I'm not upset about this, okay? I got that freaking car three weeks ago. You think I'm happy it broke down already? Another reason why you shouldn't have bought a car from your best friend. We're here. This is your aunt's house? Ah, it's been a while since I've seen them. Are you sure they're not dead? Shelly! It's alright. Look, if you guys don't wanna go in, we understand. No. Shelly sometimes, well, sometimes Shelly is just Shelly. Miss, you shouldn't be so jumpy. What's going on here? Name's Harold Pinter. I'm the caretaker for the Crowleys. I just happened to see her wandering along out here. You shouldn't be alone in this neck of the woods. A person could disappear out here and never be found. Uh, sir, my name is Chloe Romero. Doris and Roy are my aunt and uncle. Well, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Crowley are out to lunch, but you're more than welcome to come in and wait for them. No, thank you. Sir, do you have a phone we could use? We found these folks a ways back. You see, our car broke down and... Sorry, kid, I can't help you. The Crowley's don't really believe in phones. Great. But you're more than welcome to come in. And when the Crowleys get back, I'll take you into town. Alright. That sounds fine. This way. So how long have you known my aunt and uncle for? Quite many years now. After the last grain silo closed down, many folks were leaving Metsburgh. The Crowleys came into town one day looking for someone to help around the house. What kind of people are they? I haven't seen them since I was a little girl so... They're quiet people. I think that's why Mr. Crowley likes the country so much. It seems the Crowleys like their privacy. Oh, yes, sir. They like to make sure every door in the house is locked before bed. Why is that? I'm not too sure. After 10 o'clock, I don't see or hear them. That's the master, Mr. Crowley, the day he found his riches. Riches? My Uncle Roy, he was once on the cover of Metsburgh Times. He was considered a wealthy man. Yeah, sure looks like it. The master, he believes in a higher purpose. He didn't believe in material items. Years ago, when our town folded up, the mayor sold a lot of the town's property off. Mr. Crowley used his riches to save what was left of our town. In doing so... Uncle Roy was an explorer, so he didn't care much for money. That's very correct. Say, how old were you when you last saw your uncle? Right before my father died. You know that's how my mom and dad met. I didn't know. I don't talk about it much. If you'd like, I've got a set of bedrooms all made up. You're too kind, but me and Joe can just share. Oh, I don't think the Mrs. would be too happy about that. It's just for a few nights. Say, when are the Crowleys getting home? Oh, I reckon sundown. Sundown? Really? This way. I will show you to the rooms. You got a bathroom around here? Yes, sir. To your right. Don't they believe in lights in the house? Ma'am, the only electric is in the living quarters. Mr. Crowley doesn't really believe in electric. The door is locked, sir. Locked? I don't know if I made you all aware. The master doesn't like unlocked doors. Maybe we should just wait outside. What do you say? Ma'am, I've already locked that door too. I suggest you all wait until the master and his wife returns. Now wait a minute. You can't just keep us locked up in here. I would do no such thing, sir. You're more than welcome to leave at any moment. This way. Do you remember that maniac we caught last year? Phil Looney? Yeah, I remember him. When we arrested him, he spoke about a new world, a world where order and justice worked hand in hand. Hmm, too many times our laws protect the guilty. I don't see where you're going with this, sir. You notice anything? This, this is what that same justice looks like. See his hand? Hair? Son, I do believe it is. It's 3:10. Ah, shit. You know her? Yeah, I know her. My oldest used to babysit her. After her mom passed in a car accident, she stayed with me for about a year. Sir, you are not authorized to photograph this scene. I have a right to be here. Murderers, sir, they do come in all shapes and all sizes. Now Chloe has a boyfriend, a fella by the name of Joe Spencer. He's a local junkie scumbag. Well, I ran all her known relatives. The only one local is an aunt and an uncle at Metsburgh. I remember I tried to track them down for something a couple of years back, but they were on some kind of extended vacation. I never could reach 'em. Aunt and uncle up in Metsburgh, you say. Maybe I'll reach out to the state police and the FBI, see if we can find them before they get to, what are you thinking about? Well, shit. I bet he's awake by now. You're not serious. You're not seriously thinking about going to see that retired crazy old bat of a man, are you? Alright, I need everybody to stay behind the tape, please. Metsburgh. Shit. It's almost dusk. When are they gonna get here already? I just wanna go to the wedding, Christopher. Chris, I just want to go to the wedding. Soon, babe. What are you looking for? Nothing, I'm just looking, I guess. Hey, you don't find anything a little weird going on here? Sir, good to see you. Madam, your niece, young persons are in the living quarters. Chloe! This is my boyfriend, Joe. And this is my uncle, Mr. Crowley. Roy. Call me Roy. And who are these young folks? I'm Chris. This is my girlfriend, Shelly. You see, our car broke down just a little ways back, and your niece here was kind enough to solicit your help. Thought you kind folks could drive us into the city. Madam, I did say I would be willing to drop them off once you've returned home. Perfect. Should we be on our way? Nonsense. Excuse me? You must stay for dinner first. It's not everyday my niece and her little friends stop by. It's time for celebration. Wonderful! I'll start the oven now. Let's all get to know each other. What's wrong with you, boy? What is wrong with you? Nothing, babe. I'm just tired. Roy, please. It's not polite to sleep at the table! Well, perhaps he'd prefer to be shown to his room. I'm sorry. Really, it's okay. Harold. Take his plate. What the fuck are you looking at? Sir, if you wouldn't mind, this way. Yeah, sure. Joe, no. No, Chloe. They're right. How rude. I just need to go lay down. Roy, please. I have not seen my niece in many years. I would very much like to catch up. I think we should just get going. Uh-huh. Ma'am, with all due respect, we really are on limited time, and we really do need to get to a wedding. You will sit there and you will eat my wife's home cooked dinner! You can't just keep us... Shelly. You know what, let's not be rude. We can sit here and enjoy the nice dinner. Thank you. Oh, your hands are freezing! Here, take this. Are you so cold? Thanks. So Aunt Doris, what did you make? It's food. Do you like food? Uncle Roy, I was just curious. It smells so, so good. Uncle Roy? What the hell is going on here? Chris? Chris, what's going on? I have no idea. What's the matter, honey? Aren't you hungry? Hey! Hey! You can't lock me in here! Hey! Shit! Help. Is anyone there? Help. Hello? So sorry about that, precious. Where's Uncle Roy? Harold is giving him his nightly bath. Oh, it's 10 to nine. We must be getting ready for bed. What about the ride? I'm sorry, honey. I can't let Harold leave right now. He must finish his chores before the clock strikes 10. In fact, I must find you kids a room to stay in for the night. Oh, no. Listen to me. We're not spending the night! So if you're not gonna help us, then we're just gonna leave. No, no, I don't think that's possible. You see, I have to keep the doors locked tight. No one can leave after 10. Yeah, well, it's not 10 o'clock yet. So respectfully, let us out, or I'll be forced to break down that door! Alright, deary. I will get Harold to unlock the doors. No need for violence. What the hell is wrong with these people? I'm not sure. I mean they're older, from a different time. Listen to me, you do whatever you want, okay? But I suggest you go and get your boyfriend and we all leave here together. I think you might be right. I'm starting to feel a little uneasy about this. You're starting to feel a little uneasy? How the hell do you think we feel? We walked into a crazy house, and now we're being held prisoner. Shelly, shut up. What the hell kind of meal was that? I've never seen meat like that before. Can you calm down for me, please? Chloe, I'm serious. I think we should just leave. Where's Harold? He's tending to your uncle. Now I know it's one of these keys. Where's Joe? Harold says he is in his room. I will show you to yours as soon as I let these pork chops out. I think me and Joe might just go rent a hotel room in town. What the hell are you doing? Step away from the door. It's getting late. I must put you in your rooms. You're so pretty. Shh. No! Oh, no, no! Chris! Shelly, we need to hide. Lucas Dutton, I haven't seen you in years. What can I do for you? Metsburgh is full of myths and urban legends. What's one more, right? Why the devil would you wanna go up there? When I think of all the time I wasted chasing after one man, all that time wasted, shit. I found out a few weeks ago I got cancer. He gave me three months to live. I've been meaning to tell you, I'm real sorry about your loss. But Wendy was a good woman. Well, thank you, William. So you want my help. Well? Just your typical runaway involved in a murder case across county lines. So this is a personal request then. I mean otherwise, we'll be allowing the FBI to do their job. Look, I know you've got a lot going on, and I don't mean to put you on the spot. Last thing you're gonna wanna do is work at this point. Well, I got nothing else to do, I mean other than waiting to die. So what the hell, why don't we go to Metsburgh? What's the worst thing that can happen? Where did she go? I'm not sure. Where the fuck is Chris's body? Fuck the keys! Let's just break the window. What if she hears you? I wouldn't do that if I were you. What the hell was that? What the hell is going on here? A safety net was installed a few years back. Safety net? I thought there was no power running through the house. My boyfriend is dead. Is this some type of game to you? We need to get you to safety. Where is Joe? What did you do with him? Ma'am, I must strongly suggest we return to our rooms for the evening. No! I think you can show us where Joe is. Ma'am, please! I must strongly suggest... Why? What are you so afraid of? It's feeding time. Hello! Mr. Crowley? Mrs. Crowley? Is that you? Oh, fuck it! What did they do to you? Is there anyone here? How did you get down here? What do you want? What's wrong with you? Your stomach, it's so tight. I'm gonna break you free, okay? Yes, hurry. Help me to help you. I got lost in this house. Do you know how to get out of here? You can't get out, not without the keys. I'm gonna break you free. Christ! Why are they making you eat? Who are these people? Monsters. They're monsters! If they find you here, they'll... What's your name? Why are you down here? Hey! Eric. What? My name is Eric. Alright, great. Eric, tell me why you're down here. What are they feeding you? Strangers, friends, people. I'm gonna find something to break you out. Hey, what are these? Where are the rest of them? Silver. Silver. Oh, shit. I'll only be a moment, William. Why don't you go wait in the car? They were here. What? How do you know? They were here. Besides, that address you're looking for, it's right down the way. Find his ass already! We've gotta get out of here! I don't understand. I locked that door. How could anybody... ♪ Hush, little baby ♪ ♪ Don't say a word ♪ ♪ Aunt Doris is gonna buy you ♪ Go away! Leave us alone! As long as we stay in here, we should be safe. ♪ If that mockingbird won't sing ♪ ♪ Aunt Doris is gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪ What do you want? Where did she go? Harold, what is she? Fuck your boyfriend and let's get out of here. What are you doing? We need to go. I can't. I serve the masters. I suggest you run. Harold, what are you doing? Oh, shit! Kill them. Kill them all! What's so funny? I'm gonna have to get a rabies shot now. Stay here. Police. Put your hands where I could see 'em. I'm not kidding. I'll blow you the fuck right out of that chair. Now slowly, carefully. How dare you enter my house without permission! Many years ago, during my travels, I discovered a centuries-old treasure, a treasure that would bring my family unexplained fortune to last a lifetime. I come to find out I also discovered the key to immortality. Ah, a fortune that would last not just one, but unlimited lifetimes. You know, that's a really boring story. I don't remember asking. What the hell are you? In your culture, you would call me a monster. Your blood. Your blood is polluted. Good boy. Ma'am, please. I can't anymore. I'm so full. I give you life and you disrespect me by throwing up my fresh food? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not right, ma'am. I'll do anything. Yes, anything. You will, my love. When you're finished here, I have a surprise for you. Please, it's not right. When you're finished there, there's more! No, please, I can't. She's so tasty. Please, I'll do anything. No. Please. She's alive. It appears she is. Fuck you, you crazy bitch! Please, no. Problem solved. Have you seen another girl running around here? No, ma'am, I have not. When I return, you better have this finished for tomorrow, we celebrate. Celebrate? Yes. Tomorrow is the day of your freedom. Freedom? Yes. Why did you come here? What, what is she? A monster. Shelly? She's dead. You need to leave. How do you kill her? See that silver? She hates silver. This? What have they been doing to you? They're stuffing me for a feast. We need to get you out of here. No, you need to go. I can't just leave you here. No, go. Who are you? Introductions later. Do you have a way to get out of here? Sadly, no. What happened to you? Some crazy old guy bit me. What guy? Some goddamn vampire monster thing. Do you know how to use this? I assume you aim and pull the trigger. Sometimes you gotta cock it. I think I know someone who can help us. Sorry, Lucas. Sorry, Sheriff Dutton. Wait, your crazy ass family are werewolves, attacked you. I know how it sounds. Please! Are you high right now or just having a really bad trip? And then you bring this old man... Hey! Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me. A cop. Retired. Into my house, talking some crazy shit about some werewolves. Is this a way for Joe to get outta paying me my money? Chloe, I like you, but don't fuck with me, okay? If Carol even caught on that I was trying to get you guys high again... You have to believe me. So much for his help. What did you just say, old man? Look, if you're not going to help us, fine. Chloe, we need to get out of here. We're wasting our time. Oh, so that's it? Look, we're hoping you and some of your friends would be willing to come back to the house with us and help us take care of our little problem. Please, Christmas. They killed Joe. I have no one else. Say I believe this bullshit story, okay, what can we do to help you guys? Detective howdy-doody over here says he shot two of those things multiple times. And according to him, those sons of bitches got right back up. How do you plan to kill them? With this. That? Yes, this. Is that real? Look, if you help us, I'll show you were the rest of them are. You can have them all. This is a real dubloon. How do you know that? Let's just say I know. Carol spent three years in Spain studying ancient relics. Chris, if this is real, it could be worth a shitload of money. It's yours along with the rest of them. Please, just help us. How is that going to kill them? we melt it down along with any other silver we can find. You better not use Carol's good kitchen set on that. We should be able to buy a brand new kitchen set. Well, it's your lucky day because Lone Ranger here was a real ranger. Ain't that right, bruh? That's right. Ranger over here knows how to make bullets. You alright in there, Barney? Yeah, I'm fine. Just fine. I did a little digging. It says this coin is nearly 300 years old. It came from a shipwreck of a 1715 Spanish treasure fleet called the Capitana. There were over 110 silver coins, all worth over $1 million. It said the ships sank during a hurricane that hit them on July 30th and 31st, 1715 as they sailed past Florida on their way back to Spain. The ship sank, as one survivor described, from a beast. Three days later, that same survivor went missing, presumably with the treasure. Okay. So what's the plan? We strike at dusk. They seem to leave the house during the day. Why? I don't know. Jason, Ash, you guys can circle around the house. Make sure no one gets out. Chloe, myself and Detective Dewy over here, we're going to approach the front of the house. You all need to understand that these aren't people that we're fighting here. They're monsters. Christmas, what are you gonna do when you find out all this is fake? Yeah, and when he does, I'll be there to crack a laugh myself. Right. Where do you want me? You're our backup. Could you really believe in all that? I do. I don't know who I believe in, but whichever way this does go, someone's got me covered. Chloe, would you come over? I think we need to talk for a minute. Shoot. Well, I think you got a pretty good idea of what we're up against, and I think you know there's very little chance that any of us are coming back alive. We're still going. Yeah, but I'm old, tired. Look, you've got your whole life ahead of you. Chris, you said this was over. Well, what do you rather I do? Would you rather I back out of this? If what she's saying is true, Carol, we could be rich. Then just steal the damn coins from her. All we're gonna do is just go to the house tomorrow and just scare them. That's it. I've got the coins, and then that'll be it. Plus you know know I have the best guys working with me too. No money is worth that. Look, it's a myth, okay? Trust me, everything's gonna be okay. I promise. I promised I'd take care of you. To Dutton? To Dutton. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Me and Ash are gonna walk around back. Take this. Why, what is this? Father, give her strength when strength is needed. Ash, what is this? A blessing. You'll know when it's needed. Thank you. So, what's the plan? Well, I'll lead us in, guns blazing. Just don't stop shooting. Doesn't sound like much of a plan. Have you got a better one? Do you smell that? It smells like death. Whoa! Gentlemen, I believe you are trespassing on private property. Jesus, Lord, help us! Your Jesus can't help you now! It's gonna be dark soon. Let's wait until then. Are they still in there? I didn't see anybody get out. Yeah. You ain't seen nothing yet. Alright, I've had enough of this. Let's do this. I am tired of this. What? What is it now? Hello, friends. Oh, Chloe, really? Oh, you gotta to be kidding me. Alright, Chloe, alright, alright. Ma'am, let me just come out and say this. Are you some kind of wolf? I mean because if you are, can we just get that on the table now so at least I know what the hell's going on here? Christmas, walk back this way. Now wait a minute, Chloe. I mean if you say she's that evil and you say she killed our buddy Joe, I wanna hear it. Or maybe, maybe she's hiding him... Ma'am, you wouldn't be trying to hide Joe, would you? Alright, I've had enough. Is Joe in the house? Yes. There, Joe is in the house. Well, could you please tell him to come out? Tell him his old buddy, Christmas, is here to see him. Joe isn't feeling very well. Perhaps you'd prefer to come inside to see him. No, it's a trick. Trick? Joe is in the house. See for yourself. Joe, are you in there? Hey, Christmas, how did you find me? Really? Why don't you come in? Why don't you come on out there? I, uh, I can't. Are you happy? Why don't you come inside? No, bitch. Damn! What the hell, Chloe? You smell good. - Let's play! - Get off me! Let go of me! Get off me! Okay, okay, so yeah, something definitely is wrong with her. And that wasn't Joe in the house. Okay, that sounds like a big ass animal. Now how did that happen? I don't know. Maybe we should walk away. Yeah, maybe let's run. Sounds good. In here. Come on. Please come out. I promise to kill you quickly. We have to keep this closed. If she gets in... But you promised we'd catch up. What is it? Oh, fuck. Silver. We have lived for many centuries, and we will live centuries more. Do you think you're the first who's tried to stop us? No! Many years ago, your uncle discovered our tomb. He had awoken us. We took on the forms of your Roy and Doris Crowley. You're a worthy adversary, child, but no match for your fate! Oh, shit, shit, it was holy water. You can't. It's my blood. Help me. We gotta cover her with this. I don't understand. It's my blood. When he attacked me, he said my blood was poisoned. Now take that and cut that damn thing's head off. Oh, it's a good night to die. Well, don't let me slow you down. Come in. Hello, Mr. Sanders. How are you today? That's what I'm here to find out. Well, let's take a look. What's wrong, doctor? Nothing. Nothing? Your body, it's cancer free. I'm sorry, doctor. I'll be outta here in a moment. No, I'm sorry to disturb you. Who are you? Why don't you have a seat. So what did happen to you anyway. I heard you had a miraculous cure. Stage three, wasn't it? Is there anything I can help you with? What was it the papers called 'em, Gore? Why are you telling me this? I'm seeking out individuals who have unique abilities, and he seems like someone we would be very... We? Yes. I represent a group, a group of individuals who have unique abilities. And an unstoppable killer seems to fit into that perfectly. Welcome, Mr. Sanders. You're now one of THEM. You sure it's okay? Oh, my god, he's dead! I've been up here like a bunch of times. It's totally fine.
