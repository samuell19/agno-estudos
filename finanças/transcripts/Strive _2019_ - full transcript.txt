I know you had that sister of yours -who got eyes on college. -A thousand for now. I'll handle that a different way, later. One thousand United States legal title. That grand is yours. Aight. I won't even ask what piece your sister's eating. -What? -Look, you're lucky I don't smoke you for a move like that. All right, now it's 10%, you know where to find me. [train wheels screeching] At the restaurant down the block. Bye. -Was that Terrance? -CRYSTAL: Yeah. He's on his way. Look, I just want my friend to be happy, okay? Mm. Excited to see me. I can tell. I got to go check on Bebe. [whispers] Excuse me. Hey, Bebe, you home yet? [sighs] I'll be home in a second. KALANI: I told you to go straight home. You need to rest. I'm going to be a little late. You going to be okay? All right. Love you. Love you, too, bye. [knocking on door] [door clicks] I have something I need to tell you. TERRANCE: Listening. Um, I'm a virgin and I plan on staying that way. You think that's why I want to be with you? Well, Kirk and I used to argue about that all the time. TERRANCE: I'm not Kirk. I like you for who you are. Well, you say that, but we don't even know each other. I mean, we know each other but we don't know each other. Okay, so, what do you want to know? Um, what do you plan on doing after school? Well, I'm definitely going to college. Hoping to get into Howard. -Howard, that's a good school. Yeah. What about you? KALANI: I want to go to college, too. Where? Yale. Yale? [chuckles] Wow. I feel like it's a little out of my league, but it's the same way I felt before I applied to the school I'm at now, so. You're right. I definitely didn't know the girl behind those beautiful braids. [romantic music playing] From now on, only when we are in public, but not like this when we are alone, Tye. What do you mean? Maleek, I've been waiting for you. Tye, I thought I told you not to let her back in here. -I have to talk to you. -About what? I already gave you the bread. -I'm keeping it. -No, you're not. Look, I got a plan. Tye and I will act like we are a couple and people will think it's his, but you and I will-- -You're going to do what I said. -No, I'm keeping the baby. Look, we can figure this out. You think this is a game, shorty? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Maleek. -You think I'm playing too? -BEBE: No, stop. Help, please! No. [screams] Tye! Help me! Stop. Please! [door creaks] Yo, Ma, you here? [Jacob sighs] Hey, K, it's me. You don't have to call back, I'm... just sitting here thinking about Pops. I know you worry about me, but know I love you.

I didn't know, I-- I swear to you, I didn't know this was happening. I have to ask you these questions, Ms. Johnson, -I'm sure you understand. -Kalani, thank God you're here. Where's Bebe? What happened? They got me out here questioning me like I'm a criminal. Bebe is in the other room down the hall. You're from Child Protective Services? We're asking your mother a few questions. It's standard procedure in matters like this. Well, my mom busts her ass every day, you should be ashamed of yourself. You got a problem? He's a friend.

You could give us some privacy, too, Miss. Of course. Um, here is my card. I'll reach out to you if I have more questions. Do you know you could have cost me my child? I trusted you.
