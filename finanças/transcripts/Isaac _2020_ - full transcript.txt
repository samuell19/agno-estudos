How are you? Very well. And you? Fine. I’ve been meaning to call you. Seriously. You shouldn't have bothered. Marta. I am on my way. Your father? Tell him to calm down. I've been to the law firm. Yes, I've got the vermouth. Nothing, I got distracted. I'll tell you in a minute. Kiss. I'll see you now. Bye now. This vermouth is not the same. No. I bought it somewhere else on the way. My risky brother-in-law, I like it. - Of course. What is life without risk? A bore. How are things with Nacho? We have already assumed it is not possible. Has he reacted? He has suggested an adoption. Darling, you know in this family it's not an option. A friend’s daughter has opted for... surrogacy. Yes, don't look at me like that, a surrogate mother. As soon as you have the baby there is nothing to worry about. We cannot give up children. They settle us in this world and give us social strength. I don't know what Nacho will think. You must value all the options, and based on that, come to an agreement with your husband. It is best to tell white lies or half-truths to men... and let them think that they had the right ideas. Imagine. 20 years without knowing anything about him. We lived so many things together. And suddenly, by chance... Those were the days... I remember it like... very magical. Denis was a heartbreaker. He was a free spirit I tried Marihuana with him. We hung out at night. We met girls. He loved indie music. Los Planetas. And that band you don't like... La Buena Vida... and that song...? He has asked to borrow some money. You never told me about him. I lost track of him. You have said yes. I did not say anything. Marta Domenech? We leave the IUD. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. The judge and the prosecutor have them, I think they are open to an agreement. We will have to give in too much. You know I don't like to make any concessions. Nacho. What? We live comfortably. Yes, we do. There are couples without children. We could have a dog. Do you really want to talk about this, now? Come on. I don't want a dog, Marta. I want a family. We will make it better if we can share it. You get it, right? My parents will not tolerate an adoption. They have even suggested a surrogate before that. Who has suggested it? Your mother. Crazy, right? Have you lost my number? Do you have anything to do? Come with me. Come on. Hit it. Yes. Go, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa. Non-stop? - Yes. Warm up, warm up first, no. One-one, one-two. There. One, one, two hit! That’s it. One, two, one, two. Come on, go. Come on, come on, go! One, one, two. One, two, hit! We are lending the money to Denis. I will meet with him tomorrow. He is my friend and he needs it. Does he? Yes. And for us it’s not so much effort. I understand that your parents won't accept the adoption and... your mother's idea doesn't seem so far-fetched. Listen: I think it's an ideal solution for our plans. and also now with the election, we cannot go around... traveling for a subrogated mother, we have no time, Marta. It suits us all. Your parents will have the grandchild they need... and us the child that we want. Good evening. What a surprise. Hey. How are you? Good and you? How nice of you to come. I've been thinking about it and I want to help you. A zero-interest loan? Not quite. And what do you want in return? Well that's the proposal. His wife agrees and they are just waiting for us to confirm. It's a lot of money. But who the hell are they and who do they think they are? Skinny... Yes, your old pal and his wife. It’s the opportunity of our life. Of your life. No, ours, fuck. Aren't you tired of surviving? It’s the lucky strike we need. Ah, so your lucky strike is that I get pregnant? Aren’t you smart. Let me see. You won't convince me. Skinny, we’ve been trying to get out of is rut for years. Look at me, hey. What? Do you trust me? I don' need to tell you over and over of course I trust you. Well, I don't know what to think, people move on and we are still here. No, we are slowly making it. What if I just am frustrated? Luck passed me by and I didn’t see it. I don't believe in that famous lucky strike I believe in fighting, we are doing everything possible to make it. Do it for me. We need that money. No, people like them just look after their interests, we don't even exist for them. It's only a few months and our lives will change. Meet them. We’ll set up a delicious dinner and decide. You know I can't control myself and if I am judged I will aim to the jugular. Don't worry because they are very polite. I'm not. You're... What? You are the best. It turns you on to see me like this, huh!? It turns me on a lot. Yes. A lot. It drives me crazy. I'll take some rice too, to make risotto. Radish. Let's see. We almost went, remember? Of course, I remember, it would have been grand. My father would have never let me go. Mine neither. But we should have escaped, that would have been the right thing to do. The Three Musketeers. Who? Denis, Isaac and Nacho. Inseparable. Isaac? You never mentioned him. Until one day this man disappeared without telling us where he was going, without saying goodbye. About a good friend. How exaggerated. I told you. I had to go with my father to Mexico. Damn... Your mother was truly amazing. She was... she was very sophisticated. Yes, and very crazy. I was very envious. His mother was French and looked like she was taken from... a magazine or something. She liked luxury a lot. Just like me. But everything changed a lot. Your Nacho wasn’t very good at boxing, but he was amazing at drawing. He did some awesome comics; didn't he show you any his works of art? That was a hobby of a lonely teenage geek. Let's see, Denis, what kind of man keeps drawing comics after forty, huh? Well, one that is not like you. You see? She does know me well. I want people to travel through their memories with their taste. My life is full of ingredients, and feelings. And so is my cooking. Yes, I want my restaurant to be full of gourmet cuisine and personality. I remember that time we ate that mussels sandwich. It's from the Jalisco area, tequila, birria and tostas ahogadas. Like two teenagers. It’s Carmen's favorite tequila, from Mexico. I like Mescal better, but this is one of the best tequilas one can find. There is a very nice picture in the bathroom. Thanks, it's mine. I have painted it. Carmen is very good at everything she does. You drink a lot? Tons. And your family, is there any track of cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's...? Alcoholism? Enough, no? Skinny, these are normal questions. Carmen, we have the right to know everything even the most personal stuff. Denis says you're a seamstress, but you're also a singer, right? Do you do a lot of nightlife? Do you have studies? Horoscope? Horoscope? That was a joke. Marta. Well. This is the contract. The agreed amount will be paid in three payments a first payment of three thousand euros when we sign the contract. Second payment of ten percent when the pregnancy is certified and a third and final payment upon delivery of the baby. The undersigned acquire the commitment and obligation of confidentiality. Give it to me, I’ll continue. The undersigned, that’s you, Carmen, will lend ovules and belly while the undersigned, Nacho, will lend to the same purpose, sperm. The advice of a close family doctor who will do a weekly review will be required. Maintenance of the surrogate mother is guaranteed throughout the gestation period as well as childbirth expenses. One more thing: you promise not to have sex from the beginning of the process until at least Carmen is pregnant. What? What do you think of that last thing? We'll manage. Why do two lawyers like you lend themselves to this? Well, here it is not allowed, but in other places a surrogate is completely legal. A woman becomes pregnant with your baby, carries it for nine months, gives birth, gives it to you and then your register it as yours. And why don't you go to other countries? Carmen, this contract is— Don't waste our time, will you sign? Are you not ashamed? Not even a little? No. And you don't mind if another woman gets pregnant with your husband? Look, you have no idea of what my needs or my priorities are. I’ll walk you out. Carmen. Let's talk about it. I think you've talked enough for both of us tonight. It's a matter of trust, it's what we always talk about. Right. I would like to trust you as always, but this is not as always. They are talking about renting my belly as if it were I don't know what. Okay. We can help them. Take that pregnancy as an act of generosity. Marta is desperate to give a son to Nacho. and she is one of those women for whom not having a child is like having a tare, I don't know, a factory defect. Right. Or that she cares too much about what people of her tribe think of her. Exactly. She is a very classic woman, very conventional. She is a poor woman. She doesn’t look like a poor woman to me. But she has a lot of dogmas in her head and she doesn't even know it. Let me go, come on. Come on, you are not going to be able to go to sleep with that anger. Let's relax. Go to hell. What's wrong with our lives, huh? What's wrong with working in a restaurant that isn't yours? I understand that it is a sacrifice, okay? But I will be by your side. We are talking about a lot of money. And then we leave. We can set up a restaurant in San Francisco or wherever you want. And we can set up the restaurant we have always dreamed of. That you have always dreamed of. And don't you like it? It's nine bad months and we get out of here. I think the price is too high. And don't you want to make it happen? Doesn't it sound fucking amazing? Hey. What are you afraid of? Getting pregnant. I'll be by your side. And what about how I feel? What if we are wrong? If I am not able to give the child later? What if this destroys us? We are not going to be wrong. I know. That pregnancy will connect us more. We'll think of something. We should apologize. Of course, the problem are our manners. I didn't say that, Marta. I’m saying that we should all do our part. Our part is to pay. Hi. It's nice. But it must be complicated to work here. I manage. No. You toe the line. And you could have more. You don’t want more and Denis wants it all. I will make sure that half of the money goes to you. Why are you getting into this mess? Children settle us in this world and give us social strength. Besides, we must give meaning to life and marriage. Doesn’t your marriage make enough sense to you? Ah, I'm a Leo. It would fit you very well. Marta. Be quiet when you come in. We will need the updated list from lawyers association. We will ensure that our campaign is official. Do you have any questions? Nacho, the campaign manages itself. You just have to say the right thing and don't make too original proposals. Official accounts are required. Of course, of course. Everything must be in order, with discretion. Not many people vote, and we don't want to wake up those voters, understand? Nacho, do you understand? I thought you were tired of me. You bought it online. "Insemination kit" nine ninety-nine, shipping included. I'm not kidding. I hope he is clean. What clean? Your husband. Of venereal and sexually transmitted diseases. Goodbye. Congratulations. Thank you. A drink? Sure. I’ll give you the money from the second payment later. Let's get away. Let's get away from here for a few days. No mom, we are not staying for many days. Yes, Mom, he said he will be responsible. Ok mom, bye. Do they fit you? Yes. Let's go for a walk. I’ll wait for you here with a beer, while cooking dinner. Right. He's so pretty. And he’s so good... Yes! Next month there is another hearing. I think they will change the judge. It looks good to me. But patience... I'll tell you next week, okay? Glad to see you, take care. How are you? There is a very good place that I can option. I should take a trip as soon as possible because if I see it and I like it I would start with construction and decoration right away. A trip? Yes. Where? Well I’m not going to set the restaurant here. You didn't tell me that. I am telling you now. The guy from the agency told me not to miss this opportunity... Come on, throw yourself. I'm going. Come on. It seemed like a silly idea but I like it. Home for a drink? Do you want? If the grill owner came, it would give him an anxiety crisis. You would make a good mother. You are talking too much. You have to forgive me, I don't usually gauge the effect of my words and sometimes neither of my actions. I’ll shut my mouth. How stupid. What an idiot you are, please. I am starving. Let's go grab something. Look, I'm going to show you a game, okay? Go ahead. But take it seriously, huh? First you have to choose a pair of shoes that catch your attention and then guess who is wearing them by looking over them slowly with your eyes until you reach the face. Don't laugh, I do this to relax, this is very serious, I tried meditation and that didn't help me at all. You have always been good making up stories. See those two? Come up with a love story. Ok. They met in high school. Really? Clearly, look at them. But they ended up separated because she prefers humanities ...and he prefers technology. But she is clearly an architect. No, they were neighbors, but they lost track of each other, and then her cousin... Yes, her cousin brought them together again at the baptism of her son. Wanna bet? Two hundred bucks. Let me think about it. Yeah, not a chance. Hi. Hi, how are you? Can I ask you a question? Yes, of course. Are you from here? Yes, well, I am; he’s from Wales. Oh, oh, great. I was playing with my friend and we made a bet. We're on vacation, well, we just met. Let's see. Nothing! He is from Wales and they just met at a bar. Oh wow. You are so bad at this. Just so bad. Bye! Bye, see you! Sure, ok. Whenever you want, of course. I miss you too. Kiss. I’ll tell him, and another one for Carmen. Goodbye. Marta, she sends a kiss. Kiss received. And then? They aren’t coming back tomorrow. They're becoming good friends. Stop. Come here, come. Let's smoke a little joint and have a laugh. We could never say no to you. You just don’t want to. Why do you say that? Because Marta is not going to find out. I'm not going to tell her and neither are you. And it has only been a couple of innocent fucks. Do you remember the first one we smoked? Isaac, you and me. You protected both of us. But you left without saying anything. Have you ever thought about how we felt? You still haven't told me how you found out about Isaac. We left him alone, both of us. I've been dragging this all my life. No one was to blame. Skinny! We are leaving. We are leaving this country. Come here! I love you! Let's toast. For what? You no longer have to have it. What do you mean? We can stop it. What nonsense is this, Denis? You don't have to go through with that anymore. Here. Here! No, wait, wait, wait. It is not... Ok wait. You are the artist of this family. You can do anything you want, you would be the best. What would you like to do in life? Why would you want to carry on? Because we have committed, because we have signed a contract, ...because we have given our word. So? We can tell them it is a natural abortion. Fuck, that contract is not valid. It is illegal, just paper. We can't take things like that lightly! At least I won't, I have to think. But what's wrong with you? They do not want the child, they only want it to show it off. Well, maybe it doesn't make sense to you, nor to them, but it makes sense to me. But what sense does it make to you? This pregnancy is a business, nothing more. That it doesn't seem right to me. No, no, it's not ethical, it's not a game, Denis, I feel the baby. Come on, don't fuck with me! Now you are anti-abortionist. No, don't you fuck with me! You are thinking only about yourself! No, I am not thinking about myself, I am thinking about you! And I think you don't have to go through all this. Fuck, you have months of suffering left, you can avoid it. Sure, and now we tell your friends "you're not going to be parents!" You do what you want, but I'll open my fucking restaurant and I’m fucking leaving! With or without you! I didn't want this. I didn't want to be pregnant. I am selfish. Cooking is all I want in life. Nothing else. I want my own restaurant, I worked hard and finally got the fucking money. What have you done? You have slept with him. I haven't done anything he wasn’t craving for years. How can you be such a son of a bitch? Carmen! Carmen! Faggot! What the hell are we doing, Marta? I cannot do it anymore. I swear I can't anymore. Why do I always do it wrong? Always. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm not feeling well. My head is reeling and... I don't know if it will go away. I am not well. I can't stop thinking about Denis. When we were together. And I really think that... I am what I am partly thanks to him. Do you think you can fall in love with someone at first sight? I just wanted to get out of there and meet other people. Like you. Nothing else. Mom? Fine. What? Red or yellow roses? For the party? Red ones. Yes, my favorites. No mom. It's still early, you still can't notice. Yes mom. Ok mom. You finally arrived. All good? Great. The campaign is won vote by vote. We must intensify the presence of the candidate, personal calls, visits to law firms... Integrate other sectors, talk to the youngest and the seniors... Excuse me. How absurd. How absurd. Fuck. Nacho! Nacho. I want to go. How are you? My relationship with Marta didn't work. All this just brought it to the light. I'm sorry. I’m sorry that everything ends like this for all four of us. No, no, don't be, I'm fine. I’m scared, but fine. Do you know what I think? That seeing you again is the best thing that could have happened to me. Too much responsability. That’s not true. I've spent years denying it, but... now I see it clearly. The thing is... I don't know how to move. Well, you don't have to do much. In fact, nothing changes. Nothing changes? We haven't told them about us yet. And then the child who... who complicates everything, but it's the only thing I see clear now. Nacho. Don't complicate things more. What? That you're mistaken, we're not sixteen anymore. No, now you are much better. No, now I’m not what you want me to be. So don’t be misled. I’m not. I've spent years... locked. Stranded, caged. I only helped you to start. You entered the shower twenty years later. But now you have to continue with your life. With you. No, not with me. Why not? Because we would be wrong, both of us. I don't know how to love, and it would stop you from growing up. Fuck. I have also learned a lot with all this. I love being loved and wanted, being take care of, to spoil me. But I don't know how to do it. I am just like my mother. My father loved her so much... He could not stand her leaving him. He decided to hurt her. Do you know why I left? Because I felt for a photographer, my mother's friend and when my father found out, he took revenge. To harm her he took me out of the country. It broke her. He destroyed her and led her to suicide. Yes, I am selfish. But I've already done too much damage and I don't want to do it more. I will fuck whoever I want, but I will be alone. Everything is shit. Don't you think it's all shit? It seems real to me. We're not going to see each other again, right? Can you hold me? It won’t do you good. Won’t do bad either. Isaac!
