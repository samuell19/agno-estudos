My rancor... will not cease until your entire line is wiped out. Vengeful ghost! Away with you! Go! Go to your rest! Please, sir! Give me medicine! If I push you down into the river, kites and crows will consume your remains. Then you can be free of your karma and rest in peace! Bravo! Long live Kikugoro V! Bravo, Kikunosuke! What was that? What's gotten into Kikunosuke? His popularity's going to his head. I smelled booze on his breath. You were to keep an eye on his drinking. And what was wrong with you? Beside the bad acting, you closed the curtain too soon. Nothing went right! Wonderful performance, sir. They're all incompetent, every last one of them. Matsu... Kikunosuke's hopeless. If he can't even do that role right - Kikunosuke is still young. Terashima... he can't become as good as you overnight. Don't make excuses. He'll have to do better to become the next Kikugoro. Call him in here. - The young master? - Call Kikunosuke in here! Master... people say that the birth of your own son has turned you against your adopted son. I beseech you not to be so harsh on him. İsn't this the 210th day of the lunar calendar? Yes, the “day of storms.” Kikunosuke's in for another good scolding. This isn't the first time he's been a ham, but today he was a salted ham! Thank you for coming. Father, you wanted to see me? Master, please. HOW did I do? Very well. The master was quite pleased. İsn't that right, Master? Don't worry. You're still young. Apply yourself to your art. Thank you, Father. - Fuku! - What is it, Kiku? How was my acting today? Well... We're friends, aren't we? Tell me the truth. You were splendid. A magnificent performance. - Really? - Of course. I'm not so sure. Let's go to Yanagibashi tonight and have some fun. I have a prior engagement. Maybe next time. Are you going to the Teishin restaurant? - Excuse me. - I saw you there earlier. Kikunosuke's leaving. Good night. Good night. On the scales of karma, your sins and mine have a different weight. This meeting was bound to happen sooner or later. Now one of us will see our sins reflected in the mirrors of hell. l have a dagger hidden close to my chest. Already strong, with a knife I'm even stronger. The time has come... to shed some blood. Thanks, Sachi. Thank you very much. Kikugoro never fails to impress. But what about his son, Kikunosuke? Talented fathers rarely have talented sons. Everyone fusses over him and calls him “young master.” He only hears praise, never criticism. That's just wrong. What difference does it make? He bears the name Kikunosuke Onoe, one of the most respected in Kabuki. No matter how bad his acting, people will still flatter and dote upon him. Indeed. He's riding on his father's coattails. Well, what more does he need? What? The young master's here? Welcome, Young Master. When did you arrive? We had no idea you were here. Your performance tonight was a great success. Our guests were just praising you. Everyone says you're very talented for your age. I'm going home. Why? Eiryu is on her way here. She's longing to see you. Imagine her disappointment. - G000' evening. Here she is now. Eiryu, you're very late. I'm sorry. I was in such a hurry I couldn't even put on my makeup. You've made the young master angry. I can't help you. Pray to the god of courtship to set things right. Forgive me. What's wrong? Are you really angry? Is being late so terrible? Please cheer up. You're annoying me. What kind of greeting is that? I guess it makes sense. After all, I'm not one of the more popular geishas. You don't like me, do you? I know all about it. You're seeing Omei and Ohan these days. Please be quiet. I will not. Listen... I told everybody we'd be getting married. If we don't, the shame of it all will force me to leave, and not just leave Yanagibashi but Tokyo altogether. So I should stay with you just so you can save face? Good evening. Eiryu... I thought you said you'd given him up. You said so earlier. Have you forgotten already? A Yanagibashi geisha lives by her word. Or maybe the heat has made you crack. You know... made you a little crazy. I could say the same about you. You've certainly come a long way to see us. How dare you barge in like this! So terribly sorry. Let me ask you this: Why do I need anybody's permission to see my own sweetheart? The young master and I are quite close. Eiryu... you may be popular around here... but it's shameless of you to go back on your word. If you asked me nicely, I'd gladly let you have him. Really, I would. What do I care? But if you sneak behind my back, you'll make me look bad, and I won't stand for that. Keep that in mind. If you think you can take him, go ahead and try. I'm not some kind of merchandise. Get out. I'm so sorry, Konaka. How terribly unfortunate for you. You're like Daizen Kitamura in the play Koch/yama. Young Master, shall we have another drink elsewhere? Shut up and get out! Serves you right. Welcome home, Young Master. Otoku, why are you out this late? - Kozo's in a fretful mood. - He can't sleep in this heat. Let me off here. You may go. Good night, sir. Kozo's quite temperamental. Nursing him must be difficult. No, he's actually very well-behaved. His stomach's upset. He only fidgets if I don't breastfeed him enough. I see. But he's usually quite healthy. Is Father asleep? He's still awake, practicing his lines. I'll be in trouble if he sees me. What time is it? Nready 2:00 am. He'll go to bed soon. I'll wait out here until then. I'd like a wind chime, please. - Which would you like? - One with a pleasant sound. That one. Thank you very much. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you. Doesn't it sound nice, Kozo? This will make you feel better. Young Master, I saw you perform today. Is that so? I took Kozo to my family's home in lriya earlier today. My aunt was there, and she said disparaging things about your acting. I'm your brother's nurse, so of course I was disturbed to hear such things. But then I realized I'd never seen you perform, so I went to the theater later. What did you think? Young Master... don't let the flattery go to your head. I saw with my own eyes. Was I bad? Yes. Was I really that bad? I had to concede that my aunt was right. I'm just trying to be honest, though it may anger you. That's all right. Speak your mind. You're in line to become the sixth Kikugoro. You're still young, so it's fine once in a while to surround yourself with admirers and enjoy a night out, but your art is all-important, and you shouldn't neglect it. Your father often says, “Art is our life. Art. .. am! Art is the only thing that separates Kikugoro V from some man on the street.” Pardon me for being so frank. Thank you. You're the first person to ever tell me that. No need to thank me. Perhaps I'm being impertinent again... but if you want the fans to cry out your name... you must follow your father's example. I lost track of the time. I must take the baby inside. I got carried away talking. I didn't realize it's almost sunrise. Let's go inside. Don't worry. Just sneak in quietly after me. Young Master... please forgive my presumptuousness. Otoku? Many thanks. Did he fall asleep? Where's Kikunosuke? Hasn't he come home yet? The young master returned early. He's sleeping now. Really? Hurry up and get some sleep. Matsu, was it last year you fell into the river? No, the year before last. You flailed about and then struck a pose in the water. Then you told me to jump in again because you couldn't see well. Auntie, where's Kikunosuke? He said he doesn't like crowds. He went somewhere else. How is he nowadays? It's strange... but he suddenly stopped his carousing. He comes home early now. He used to ridicule me when I'd suggest that! Madam, do you know why the young master isn't here tonight? Why? Otoku's not here either, is she? She's at home with the baby. The fireworks would upset him. So you may think, but you're mistaken. Don't be ridiculous! Kikunosuke and Otoku? That's absurd! Don't say such indiscreet things. Young Master, shouldn't you go see the fireworks? It's a waste of time. I dislike the crowds and the noise. Would you like something cold? We have some watermelon. But we should probably wait for the others to return. - How many watermelons are there? - Five. Let's have one then. You'd like some? Is it cold? Yes, they've been in ice water all day. That's a big one. Must be heavy too. Let me cut it. Really? That would be a great help. You chilled it well. It's really cold. It is, isn't it? Otoku, give me a hand. Hold it steady. Ready? Doesn't it look good? Set this half aside. Hold it for me. I can do the rest. It's a very nice watermelon. Where are you taking it? - To the back room. - Here is fine. - But this is - - We'll eat together, right here. - Really? I'll add some salt. Try some. Don't be shy. Thank you. Let's eat together. It's delicious! Have some. I'll take out the seeds. You know, Otoku... I've never been as happy as I was the other night. People always flatter me to my face, then happily ridicule me behind my back. You're the first to speak to me with real warmth and sincerity. To hear that it pleased you so makes me very happy. Those geisha and other women make a fuss over me only because I'm Kikugoro's son. They couldn't care less about my acting. If I gave up my place as Kikugoro's heir, nobody would give a damn about me. I've been so lonely. When you spoke to me the way you did, for the first time in my life I felt a happiness that touched me deeply. It was like climbing a mountain pass on a hot summer's day and drinking from a cold stream. These days I can barely contain my joy. Every time I step on that stage, I imagine you're watching. I imagine I'm performing for you, and somehow that puts me at ease. You'll see. I'll become a fine actor. I want to show you I can. That's how you've made me feel. What's wrong? To hear that my words brought you such happiness... From now on, I'm going to do my very best. I'll do everything I can to help you make your way to greatness. There's little I can do, but I'll do all I can. Otoku, thank you. Welcome home. - Onaka, come here. - Yes. What were you doing? Changing the lapels on the young master's bedclothes. Otoku, I'd like you to leave tonight. You're dismissed. Go home. But why? You know why. No, I don't. The baby's become quite attached to me. I can't fathom why I should be let go. Is it because of the young master? Please, don't worry about that. I've done nothing wrong. You've gone out of your way to shower him with kindness. What on earth for? Tell me. İsn't it because he's heir to the Kikugoro name and you want to be his wife? İsn't that it? Madam, how can you say such a thing? Kikunosuke is naive, practically a child. I won't let you make a fool of him. How could you suspect such a thing of me? If that's your reason for dismissing me, I refuse to go. Then what exactly is there between you two? I encourage him to perfect his art. That's all. That's why I talk with him and show him kindness. What nerve! That's not a servant's job. He already has his father to worry about that. And he has me, though I may know very little. His father can only speak to him of the finer points of acting. What I offer him... is sympathy and encouragement, like a nursemaid to his art. That's my job. You needn't worry yourself about that. You're Kozo's wet nurse, not Kikunosuke's. Your impudence is outrageous. I've heard enough. And even if they're only rumors, that in itself does harm. Please leave. Here's the hat. Kikunosuke, are you ready? - Yes. The jacket. Listen, there are many distinguished guests and their wives here today. A great many actors as well. Carry yourself like the son of Kikugoro. Don't make careless mistakes. Good morning. Madam, where are the baby's clothes? In the third dresser drawer. I'll be there in a moment. Mother... where's Otoku? I fired her. But why? You know why. Have you seen Kiku? He just rushed off. But... he was - Hurry home. No chatting along the way. - ls Otoku here? - No. - Did she step out? - I don't know. - Where did she go? - She's not home. That's all I know. I see. Just a minute. Wait a minute. Take this. It's all right. Now, won't you tell me where she is? I heard she's with relatives. - Where? - I don't know. I see. Wait. I'll come back tomorrow. Find out and tell me then. Yes, sir. Look after the place for me. Of course. See you soon. STARRING KIKUNOSUKE ONOE Excuse me. Would you happen to be Otoku from lriya? Yes, that's me. I have a tea shop at the Kishimojin shrine. One of my customers is quite intent on arranging a secret meeting with you. Who might that be? Sir... she's over there. - She came? Otoku. How did you find out I was in Soshigaya? It wasn't easy. It took a long time to find your house, but I couldn't go in. I stopped a servant boy leaving your house on an errand. - Was it Kanekichi? - I think so. It seemed he'd been told not to say anything, but yesterday I finally convinced him to tell me. You did all that... for me? Just when I felt I'd found a true friend, you were taken away. I was distraught. Young Master... What? I'm truly happy you think of me that way, but if we keep meeting, your family will surely find out. That will cause you great trouble. It would be better if we didn't meet again. I can't accept that. It's really out of the question. I was mortified when I heard those rumors about us. What will become of me if we keep meeting and they cease to be rumors? Become of you? I want to make you my wife. No, you can't. You have a brilliant future. I'd only hinder your career. Besides... I'm just a poor mapmaker's daughter. That shouldn't come between us. Your father would disown you. Fine. We'll go away together. Welcome home. Kikunosuke, come in here. Kikunosuke! Father, I'm home. Come closer. Kiku... who was that girl you saw today at the Kishimojin shrine? I want you be a fitting successor, both in your artistry and your conduct. I want the public and my friends alike to say how fortunate I am to have such a fine son. But now you've given me cause for worry. Please try to understand how I feel. We dismissed Otoku because she can only bring us trouble. Why do you see her behind our backs? You want to see her so badly that you'd defy your parents? If you don't give me a clear explanation, I intend to take action today. Tell me exactly how you feel. Kikunosuke... you have an obligation to your foster father. People call you “The Young Kiku.” Whom do you have to thank for that? Your foster father. Kiku... you're very trusting and naive, so this doesn't surprise me, but it's foolish to think that others are as trustworthy as yourself. Otoku knows you'll be the next Kikugoro. She may have ulterior motives. She's not that kind of woman. You don't know. That's how women are. You're wrong. You spend all your time with geishas. You don't understand normal women. - They're no different. Otoku isn't calculating like geishas. Her feelings are sincere. Enough of your excuses! We forbid you to see her! Kikunosuke, come here a minute. Come here. Brother... I'm determined to be with Otoku. Father doesn't wish to be publicly humiliated. Otoku was your baby brother's wet nurse, for goodness' sake. She herself had the good sense to give you up. You're the one who's fanning the flames and making this difficult. I don't know what you've imagined, but our relationship has been chaste. Good. Keep it that way. It wasn't fair to dismiss her on false charges. Otoku gave me not only a reason to go on acting but a reason to go on living. Kiku! Do you know what people are saying? They're saying you seduced your own baby brother's wet nurse. They say our household is in an uproar. They say your foster father shows forbearance in not disowning you, even though he has his own son now, but that he's purple with rage. That's the malicious gossip going around. How can he promote you under such circumstances? Imagine the pressure he's feeling. Kikunosuke, an actor needs a public. Popularity is everything. Everything hinges on your reputation. You should be cultivating your popularity now. That kind of popularity makes me sick. I'd be happy if I'd earned it myself, but it's only due to Father's name. That's not what I want! How dare you say that! I don't want to be Kikugoro VI. I don't need the family name. I want to make it on my own! What can you do on your own? I will succeed! I'll show you I will! Eiju! You don't need me or the family name? Then get out! Go apologize, quickly! Go on! Apologize! I beg of you, Father: Let me marry Otoku. Please, Father. I beg of you, Father! Shut up! Kikunosuke! Let him go. Good evening. Good evening. May I help you? Is Otoku here? Who are you? Kikunosuke Terashima. Otoku isn't here. Where did she go? Young Master... your family has given us strict instructions not to let her see you. That's my answer. Close the door! It's dangerous here at night. Granny... please give this to the lady. Yes, sir. And please hurry back with her answer. Young Master! I heard what happened. The way you spoke to your father was out of line. Matsu! Well, we can discuss that later. Please just come home quietly. Let's go back. Leave everything to me. If you go back now and apologize, I think your father will forgive you. I won't apologize, and I won't go home. I understand. Well, then... why don't you come to my place instead? I'd like to hear what's going through your mind. We can talk things through. All right? Young Master, please do that much. Come on. Let's go. If you insist on going, I can't stop you. Please apply yourself to your art. Tamizo's a big-hearted version of Kikugoro, and he's seen his share of hardship. He'll certainly take good care of you. But listen: Don't let his willingness to help make you lazy and overly dependent. It has to come from here. You understand? Let's go. All aboard for Nagoya. Kikunosuke! What's going on? I heard the news and rushed over. Please don't be stubborn. Just come home, I beg you. You don't understand. Be that as it may, you mustn't anger your father. What about your name and career? Enough. Don't say any more. I'll go with you and apologize on your behalf. It's too late. Just you wait and see. I'll make a fresh start. I'm on my own now. I'll show everyone what I can do. Where is she? Why doesn't she come? - Who? Otoku? Matsu... did my parents forbid her to come? I don't know. That must be it. The fool. You sure you won't reconsider? Don't try to stop him. I'm sorry to have worried you. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Take care. Farewell. ONE YEAR LATER - Where are my sandals? - I don't know. What are you doing? Be more careful! I'm sorry. My sandals were there. Your sandals? You think Shoko can't handle the role? Master... you seem to like that actor, but the audience doesn't. Couldn't we use somebody else this time? He's my choice. Stop your complaining. But... No buts. That's final. We're using Shoko. - What now? - No, nothing. Master... how are you feeling? Thank you for asking. I feel like death warmed over. But I don't think I'm at death's door just yet. I'm fine, aren't I, Doctor? Yes, indeed. Master... I'm deeply sorry... that I've been such a failure. Why do you put up with a burden like me? What are you talking about? You shouldn't worry so much. Actors needn't feel embarrassed. If you're praised when you're young, you can't become good. Take me: I was terrible when I was young! I know what I'm talking about. Trust me, and keep working hard. Thank you, sir. I'm behind you all the way. Thank you. It looks like rain today. I brought your rain sandals. Thank you. Shoko... what's wrong? Tami... I'm hopeless as an actor. You've done a lot to help me. And the master did his best to encourage me just now. But I feel I should go elsewhere, maybe travel the countryside. Travel? But where? I'm not good enough for the major houses. Maybe I can improve in a small local theater. Or maybe... I could study under your father, Otsuru... to become a masseur. Tami. When you're young, it's easy to live with no thought for the future. But never stop striving... to improve your skills. Otsuru, I'm leaving. Farewell. Good-bye. Good-bye. Sir, your fans are begging for your makeup brush. Really? Then give it to them. Young Master! How long have you been here? I just arrived from Tokyo. I came by rickshaw directly from the station. I saw your performance. Really? This is a surprise. I thought you'd never come. Looks like you have a fan after all. Good for you. Let's go. Take her somewhere nice. Why didn't you come with me to Osaka? Your family ordered me not to. My parents wouldn't let me leave the house. I thought so. But when I heard you were booed off the stage, I couldn't take it anymore and ran away. None of my roles have been a success. Over the course of this year, I've completely lost faith in myself. If you had been here, it might not have come to this. In fact, before you came, I was about to leave for good. I was the cause of all your troubles. I had a swelled head when I left Tokyo, but now I realize I'm worthless. That's not true. Others may think you're a bad actor, but I see how you've improved. I see the results of your effort and pain. Your acting has a power that other people can't understand. You're almost there. You can't give up now. You were pampered in Tokyo, and you were missing that something, but this year in Osaka has given it to you. Is that true? If so, I'll keep on trying. Yes, it's true, so please don't lose heart. This is it. - I'm home. - Welcome back. Welcome. This is your room? Shaka, tea's ready! Thank you. You can sit there. Is this all you brought? No. I checked a trunk at the station. We can pick it up tomorrow. Is it all right for me to stay here? Do you even need to ask? We'll get married now. I simply came to support your acting career until you return home. And after that? After that... I don't know. Don't act as if we're strangers. Here you go. They're banging the drums already. Those drums signal the end of a performance. Quite different from Tokyo, isn't it? Otoku. .. why don't you rest a bit? You'll get sick if you work too much. But this must be finished and delivered this afternoon. III I don't want you to have to work like this, but I hope you can bear it a bit longer. You can, can't you? Don't be silly. Otoku... Kikugoro is going to play Gonta in Yosh/Tsune and the Thousand Trees. That play is the family's specialty. I think I'd be perfect as Koremori. I really want to perfect that role and wipe away my past disgrace. Yes! That's the spirit! I can do it. This time I can do it. You can. Everything will work out. The furniture's here. Careful, Father! It's okay if you hurt yourself, but don't damage the goods! What's that supposed to mean? I told you to be careful! Sorry for the trouble. Let's take it back down. Honey! Come here a minute. What is it? That's beautiful! Where'd it come from? It's a dressing table for you. A fine actor needs a fine mirror to rehearse with. It's very nice. Thank you. It's a real beauty. Father, I want one too. Don't ask the impossible. Where'd you get the money? Don't worry about that. I sold a few things I didn't need. I'm sorry. Otoku's a resourceful woman. Very admirable. Very admirable indeed. - Hello. - Hello, Tami. Shoko, terrible news! Master just died! - Master did? - Yes. But he was fine yesterday! It happened suddenly. Everyone's in shock. I'm worried about him. The playbill will be posted tomorrow. The casting has changed. I'm terribly sorry, but we're letting you go. I know this is difficult to hear. I'm sorry to spring it on you so suddenly. But as it happens, Mr. Onishi here needs actors for his traveling theater company. How's that sound? Please think it over. What do you say? We're all in shock. Tamizo's death has cast a shadow over the entire theater district. Of course you're grieving as well. Won't you try performing with us just once? I know you have pressing obligations, so I'm willing to pay you an advance. How much will you pay? Well, let's see. Say, 15 yen? That's just to start. Please take it. Don't become an itinerant actor. Can't you stay in Osaka and hone your skills? I don't want to leave, but how will we survive? Besides, Tamizo is gone. There's nothing for me in Osaka now. I have no choice. Working in a traveling troupe can be enjoyable. Right? - Quite right. FOUR YEARS LATER - Give us our pay. - How can I give what I don't have? This wasn't our agreement. We won't work like this. Fine. Then quit. You sure you want that? A couple of hams like you quitting isn't going to stop the show. Go on. Leave. Fine, we will. Give us our pay! - Like hell I will! You're too cruel. Pay us something, even if just a little. More trouble? Fighting like that over a mere pittance. Do they even think about acting? I hate it. I really hate it. I keep thinking we should leave this life of wandering behind. Four years have already slipped away. Well, isn't that a shame? Rotten luck getting stuck with me. If you don't like it, leave. I don't say it for myself but for you. I can't stand seeing you working like this in the provinces. Don't worry about me. I enjoy it. The audiences are easy to please. It's true what they say: One taste of touring and you never forget it. Who cares anyway? Give me some money. Where are you going? It's our last night here. I'm gonna have some fun. There's no money left. Liar. What about that money from before? That's to buy you a new undershirt and socks. Forget about that. Hand it over. You... you've changed so much. Mouthing off again? Cut it out. Why not try being nice to me once in a while? Please don't forget how you felt when you left Tokyo. And just how was that? That's all a dream from the past. Hand it over. Not if you say things like that. Didn't you say you would start from scratch and become a great actor on your own? Well, haven't I become one? I can play a woman, a villain, maybe even a child. You don't listen to me anymore. - Give it here. - No! You're the reason I've become like this! Here. I was wrong. Please forgive me. Go have some fun. It'll make you feel better. Aren't you going out? You'll catch cold if you sleep out here. You should go back inside. Otoku. Keep the money. But... Here. Take it back. Something terrible has happened! What is it? - We have to leave immediately! - How can that be? There are still a few days left on our contract! Attendance was so bad they want to replace us with female sumo. Female sumo? Men are here to take down the tent. Everybody out! What do you think you're doing? How dare you storm in here like this! We're not mosquitoes you can shoo away. We're human beings. Let's talk like human beings. What's there to talk about? You're a bunch of clumsy hams. What? Get out of here! Where's the boss? Go get him! Wait a minute. From what I was told, there's nothing more to discuss. - Who are you? - A sumo wrestler. I don't know what you were told, but we were told nothing! Well, I'll tell you: Your boss said clearly that you would all pack up and leave tonight. Hey, what are you doing? Hurry it up! Wait until the boss gets back! We won't finish in time if we wait. Hurry up! Wait! Listen to me! Where did the boss go? The manager and troupe leader have run off! Where'd they go? See? What did I tell you? - Where'd they go? - They abandoned us. All right, everybody, out of the way. You too, big shot! - What's that? Enough! Out of the way! Get out, all of you! Scram! What should we do? Shoko, what are we to do? Kimigiku, what will you do now? I have no choice but to go back and work for my old boss. You're lucky to have somewhere to go back to. Staying the night? It's five sen for two. Come this way. It's two sen for the futon. Poor thing. You've caught a bad cold. Take care of yourself. - How was business today? - Same as usual. A Kabuki company from Tokyo is in town. Kabuki? They charge two yen for a ticket. I could live for a month on that. Where's the company from Tokyo performing? The Suehiroza Theater in Nagoya. Who's performing? Let me see. Father and son: Shikan and Fukusuke. What luck! Darling, this is a gift from the gods. Why don't you see Fukusuke and ask his advice? I can't let him see how wretched I've become. But what if he can give you a role? Impossible. I couldn't even make it in Osaka, much less in a large Tokyo company. They certainly won't take me now. But your acting isn't bad. In fact, it's gotten quite good. If you succeed in Nagoya, you can return to Tokyo. If the response is positive, it would restore your confidence too. Shouldn't you at least try? Let's go and ask. No. You may think my old friends will help, but they may not be so inclined. You understand how the world works. No, it's easier just to keep traveling. Then what have you been working and suffering for all this time? Let's stop talking about this. We still have enough to survive a few days. We may have a stroke of luck. Are you all right? Are you in pain? This is bad. Wait here. I'll get some medicine. Wait for me. Young Master, there's someone to see you. The name is Terashima, and she has a request. Terashima ? - You said Terashima, right? - Yes. IFS Otoku! It's been so long. You're here in Nagoya? Is Kikunosuke here too? He's the reason I'm here. I have a favor to ask. I see. Come inside. I see. You've both suffered a great deal. But that suffering has enriched his art. Even a lay person like myself can see he's much better. But he still remains stuck in obscurity. I see now that in Kabuki a good family name is essential. İsn't there anything you can do to help him return to Tokyo? If he continues as he is, he'll end in complete ruin. If you don't save him now, it'll be too late. Please save him. I'm begging you. We often speak of Kiku back home. My father here and I have apologized on his behalf without much luck. Kikugoro worries about public opinion and refuses to budge. Father... let's give Kiku a role. If he does well, his father may take him back. Please, Father. Which role would you suggest? Have him play Sumizome in my place. Sumizome? Are you crazy? He may have been Kikugoro's son, but giving a major role to an itinerant actor would be an outrage. The others would never approve, would they, Morita? I know it's reckless, but what others think doesn't matter. If you and Mr. Morita approve, he can play the role. I want to help Kiku regain his manhood. Mr. Morita, please! Fuku! Fine. We'll use him. You'll give him the role? Yes. Thank you! Otoku... assuming that Kikunosuke does a good job and properly apologizes, I want him to return to his family. Are you prepared to accept the consequences? Yes, whatever it takes so that he can go home. If his acting is still poor, he can't return, but if he's really improved, are you truly prepared to give him back to his family? You mean - Otoku... this is difficult for me to say, but - You're saying you want us to separate. I knew that even before I came here. Stop here. This way. Dean Kiku! Fuku! Otoku, why did you - - Kiku. There's so much to say, but please just come with me. How heartless and fickle the ephemeral cherries can be, yet how tender and charming their flowering buds. The courtesan's young apprentices come to the pleasure quarters as though transplanted from afar to blossom at their peak every Spring- When the winds blow in from the mountains, courtesans make lovers' promises to spend the night. Yet their place of rest is uncertain, like fleeting bubbles on a stream. Cherry petals scattered on the water - such is a courtesan's lot. An interesting tale indeed. How strange this woman is, appearing so suddenly at this barrier gate deep in the mountains. Where have you come from? I come from the Shumoku pleasure quarters in the city. Courtesan, what is your name? I am called Sumizome. Sumizome? This cherry tree was also called Sumizome. I know. What a fine name! So tell me of the customs of the pleasure quarters. Of a courtesan's way of love, of the truths... - And the lies... - ...of a courtesan's tricks. And how to enter the brothels. In that case, let us speak of it here and now. Whether coming... or going- - -- in the pleasure quarters, I travel in disguise... my emotions in wild confusion. My husband's torn sleeve as my only keepsake, drawing me here, shimmering in the air. I shall tell you. My true form is this cherry tree. You would strike me with your cruel ax? Now you will know your retribution. She glares at him fiercely, a branch of the cherry tree serving as a whip. Kiku, I'm shocked at how good you were! Splendid, just splendid! Thank you for giving me this chance. Kiku, you were wonderful! I knew you could do it! Uncle Morita! - Kiku, you did a wonderful job! A truly fine performance! Your father will be so proud of you! - Thank you! Fuku, wasn't he wonderful? I'm so proud of him. You made it all possible. Master, thank you for this opportunity. You were magnificent. I've never been more pleased. Fuku, your kindness made this possible. I'll never forget it. Nonsense. Your hard work is what made this possible. Here, take off your makeup. Hurry and take off your wig. Wait till we return to Tokyo and show Kikugoro what we've brought back! “Send your beloved child out to see the world.” Exactly. Thank you. Otoku! We can go back to Tokyo. The two of us, together. Really? Of course. We must go together. I'm in a daze. I never dreamt anything like this would happen. Really? My success here has restored my confidence. When I get back to Tokyo, I'm going to work like mad. I never imagined I'd become this popular. I always knew this day would come. I just knew it would, and I looked forward to seeing the surprise on everyone's faces. You did it! Your suffering has been rewarded. It was a hard life, wasn't it? But you know... even though I knew you could do it, I was so worried that I couldn't even watch. I was under the stage the whole time praying to the fox god lnari. Isn't that silly? You must be... You must be so happy. Now you have the will to go on... and you can return to Tokyo with your head held high. What's wrong? Nothing. I was just so happy I got a little dizzy. What shall we do to celebrate? Excuse me. We'd like to order some food tonight. Bring us shrimp and sea bream sashimi, broiled whole fish, and clam soup. Kiku, this region is famous for its clams. And a few bottles of sake. - Yes, ma'am. Wait a minute. We can't splurge just because we suddenly got some money. - This arrived for you. - Thank you. But it's not every day we have something like this to celebrate. Tonight you must be like a child again and have whatever your heart desires. I had the tailor backstage bring this over. You can't return to Tokyo dressed like that. Come here. What do you think? Isn't it nice? It suits you. It's a nice pattern. You should hurry and make it into a kimono. You have to go see them, don't you? You should start getting ready. You're right. I'll be right back. I have to make an appearance. I'll say a quick thanks and hurry back. Let's celebrate when I get back. I'm off. I'll be back soon. I'll be right back. Take care. Have you seen Otoku? She was just over there. Have you seen Otoku? I don't believe I have. Fuku, Otoku's not here. Kiku. This is a letter from Otoku. You told her to leave me, didn't you? You led me to think we could go back together. Kikunosuke, wait. It was me. You? Why? Please just listen. Otoku herself knew before I even said a word. She and I both wanted to save you and send you back to Tokyo. Fortunately, your performance was a great success. Now you only need to apologize to your father. But if you don't leave her, he won't accept your apology. - Mind your own business. - His own business? Yes. What business is it - You don't know how Otoku really feels. What do you mean? Stop this, please. Kikunosuke is right. But listen - None of you understands what Otoku means to me. Apologize all you want, but I can't be happy in Tokyo without Otoku. Kiku, listen. You've worked very hard. But no matter how hard you work, you can't succeed on your own. Otoku herself said it was impossible to make it without a family name. With Kikugoro Onoe's name behind you, you can return to the major stages of Tokyo. You have to rely on the people who've supported you since childhood. What good is fame without Otoku? I want her by my side, whether I succeed or fail. I'm not going back until I find her. Kikunosuke, stop! Wait a minute. You must consider Otoku's feelings. But what's going to become of her? Those long years of wandering have taken a toll on her health. Thanks to all of you, I'll have a future as an actor, but I also want to free her of her cares. Sit down and listen. If you really care, think of what she wants for you. Return to Tokyo and perfect your art, or Otoku's sacrifice will have been in vain. Seeing you succeed just might be her greatest happiness. Right? Make her happy by becoming a great actor. Don't return to Tokyo for us. Do it for her. You understand? Fuku“. How did Otoku come to feel this way? Those five long, difficult years when I was consumed with bitterness and envy - it was her devotion alone that held me together. I thought we could've endured anything as long as we were together. Otoku... you silly fool. Where are you? Where have you run off to? Otsuru. Genshun. What's this? Who's there? Otoku, it's you! It's you, isn't it? Let me light the lamp. What are you doing here? You never wrote. We were really worried. I'm happy to see you. Where's Shoko? We broke up some time ago. Broke up? Why? I wasn't happy anymore living that life with him. I know it's been a while, but you've completely changed. Have I? Perhaps I have. Perhaps I've changed a bit. Here she goes again! I haven't seen him this happy in over six years. The whole house is full of cheer. It's made my life much easier. I'm happy to hear it. It's always been Kiku's dream to perform in Hen/ism} with Kikugoro as the lion and Kiku and Fuku as the cubs. Fuku, we're all counting on you. - And I'm counting on all of you. Morita, why don't we put on our next play in Osaka? That would be a first. Are you really serious? Let's all go and have a great time. Very well. This should be great fun. Kikunosuke had some hard times out in Osaka. Let's make a grand entrance and show them how far he's come! Great idea! Thank you very much. I'm sure the young master will be delighted. Let's clap our hands to celebrate before the master changes his mind. Everyone altogether. Ready... - Auspicious indeed! - Thank you very much. Let's hurry and decide on a play. You make the preparations. Kozo... you've gotten so big! Who are you? Don't you recognize me? No. I see. I guess that's only natural. - The offering to the gods? - Yes. It's the custom. Young Master, there you are. Everyone's waiting for you. From the summit of Mount Seiryo, I kicked my cubs into the deep valley below as a trial of their strength. Though still immature and unskilled, the power of our prayers allowed us to climb to the top again. Blossoming along the stone bridge are the colorful peonies. Now all that remains is to beg humbly and sincerely... for the audience's continued patronage. The time has come for the lions to dance to ancient court tunes Tufts of peony blossoms rich with fragrance Behold the lion heads, showing great strength Beat the drums! Let music play! The peony's scent! The flowers' golden stamens emerge from within Sporting among the blossoms, tumbling among the branches Truly nothing can surpass the lions' ferocious majesty All those people booed him off the stage when he was “Shoko.” Now they carry lanterns with “Kikunosuke” written on them. Kiku, you know Osaka well. You can show us around between performances. Come here. Osaka is like your second home, so in today's river procession, you'll be presented as the leading player. You'll stand in front and pay your respects to those who used to attend your performances. Excuse me, is Shoko - I mean, is Kikunosuke here? Over there. Where do you think you're going? I'm a good friend of Shoko's. I have something to tell him. - It's Genshun! - Hold on! It's okay. I know him. Genshun! Shoko, just look at you! Congratulations! Thank you for everything you did for us. Actually, Otoku - That's precisely why I'm here. She's staying at my place. - Your place? - Yes. She's been sick since spring, but she's gotten much worse since June. She made me promise not to tell you, but the doctor thinks she may not last long. I just had to come tell you. I know you're extremely busy, but won't you come see her? I beg you. But this is an important day - I realize that, but can't you just see her once, please? Kiku, go see her. Go see your wife. How many times have I told you that being a great actor is not just a matter of skill? You are what you are today because of Otoku's sacrifices, because she made you perfect your art. Tell her that as father of the great Kikunosuke, I am deeply grateful. Father! Go quickly. You can join the procession at Nakanoshima. Thank you. Send a telegram to inform her family. My father's already sent for them. Is that so? If her condition changes, let me know right away. Thank you very much. Let us off at this corner. Father! Otoku, Shoko's come to see you. Genshun... why did you bring him here? I told you not to. Why didn't you listen? How can you say that? We were never supposed to meet again. Dear, please leave. I mean, Young Master, please leave. Otoku, you needn't worry. Father has forgiven us. He has? He told me, “Go see your wife.” He said everything I've become is due to you. He told me to thank you. Really? I'm getting top billing on this trip. I've returned to Osaka bathed in glory. From now on we can be happy... both in art and in life. Your father has forgiven us? We can finally be together for all the world to see. So I can finally call you my husband? That's right. My husband... Now... now I can get better. Right? I'll get better, won't I? Of course. What would I do if you didn't? Your face has already regained its color. But you know, I don't mind if I die. You've become a magnificent actor. Your father has forgiven me. And now I can see your face. I can die without regret. No, you can't just leave me like that. İsn't that right, Genshun? - Yes, it is. Dean" isn't the river procession today? Your boat is waiting. Please go. I don't care about the procession. How can you say that? An actor must think of his fans. It's a grand occasion in your honor. What good is it if you're not there? Please, hurry and go. Go now. But we're finally together again. Once it's over, we can be together all we want. That's true, but... There's no reason why you and I shouldn't be able to meet, is there? None at all. Then please hurry and go. I'll be waiting here, listening to the music coming from the river, imagining you there... at the head of the procession. I've been forgiven and am now really your wife, aren't I? I don't have to hide it from anyone, right? In that case... please listen to your wife. Do what she asks of you. Very well. I'll go. Wait for me. Otoku, you must wait for me. All right? Wait for me. Genshun. - Yes. Genshun... will she be all right until I get back? I couldn't do anything for her while we were together. Now that I can do something... Otoku, don't die. You can't die. Kikunosuke Onoe humbly asks for your patronage. Genshun... would you go out on the canal and take a look? Then come back and tell me what you saw. Please hurry. All right, I Will. Otoku, your medicine. Otoku. THE END
