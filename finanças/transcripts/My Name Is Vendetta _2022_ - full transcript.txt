NETFLIX PRESENTS "To kill or be killed... this is the law." "Showing mercy is just a sign of weakness." JACK LONDON - THE CALL OF THE WILD It's a lesson that I wish I could forget. Are you all right? Come on, don't give up! Mine! Pass it! Go! Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it! Right here! - Go, Sofia! - Get it, get it, get it, get it! Over here! I'm open! Pass it, pass it... How can you be so stupid? Let's go! Let's go! Sofia, stay calm. Don't let it get to you. Stay calm! Eighty-five, 63, you're out! I never got why she does that. If you're attacked, you gotta defend yourself. - All right, Sofi! - You got it! That's it. That's it, you got it! We're gonna make it happen! You guys did awesome! See you later, ladies. Bye, Sofia. See you. Ciao, Sofi. Ciao, danke. Hey! - You guys did it. - Later. Bye, Sof. Hi, babe. Hey. You like Hakim? Good guy, I suppose. But if he hurts her, he's gonna have to deal with me. Santo, please. Come on. What do you say? - I'll call you later? - Yeah, that sounds cool. - Okay. - See ya. Bye-bye. There's the champion. Well done, Sofi. - Thank you! - You were amazing. - Thank you. - Well done. Hop in. Come on, get in. You gonna keep your promise if I do? What promise? I don't recall one. Papa, stop that. - May I know what is this about? - Well, he promised that if I did what it takes and we got into the playoffs... - Hmm? - Are you gonna? Are you gonna? - Okay. - All right! Why did you promise her a thing like that? My love, she's almost 18. She'll get her license soon. Just gonna teach her a few things. Santo, please. You know how dangerous it is. You're always making me worried... Mm. Okay. Ciao, my lover. Relax, she's a great driver. Bye, Mama. You remember, right? Fast! Are you sure? Go, go, go! Push it, Sofi. You got it! Watch that bump on the right. Back it up. That's when you juice it. Go! That is so fucking crazy. I'm sorry. Ah, we'll sort it out later. Go on. All right. Nah. No, thanks. Next week, we should get your mom to come up here with us. Or would that be the end of her? Oh, um... I've been meaning to tell you about next Sunday. Um... Well, this weekend, I have plans with Hakim. A little retreat on a motorcycle. No big deal, you know. Hmm. Our friends will be there too, you know. It won't just be us. Um, yeah. And, do you think you could convince Mama? Okay. Oh, my God. Thank you! Look how beautiful this is. Are the mountains in Calabria like this too? They have the same silence. Papa, why did you move here when you were so young? For love. Mama's a lucky woman. Come on. Let's try and be home before it gets dark. Can we get one quick picture? No. You know I don't like 'em. Why don't you let me? It's just to remember our day. We don't need a photograph to remember it by. Come on Dad, let's go. Yeah, hold on. Okay, that'll hold till we get home. MY NAME IS VENDETTA We've confirmed that all the biometric data's a match. We got him, sir. Stop! Something's off! What's up? It's not cutting straight. It's 0.5 mm at the most! Let's finish the job and fix it tomorrow. I wanna do it now. Would you be able to pick up Sofi for me, at practice? - Of course. - Danke. Hi, Mama. Hi, Sofia. How was practice today? Good. It was good. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20 Can you help me get dinner on the table? Yeah, let me throw my jersey in the wash, and I'll be there. Thank you. Hey, little sister. Hi. What about Santo? I've called him hundreds of times! He's fixing the saw. This late? I tried to tell him, but your husband is stubborn, you know? Here he is. He'll be full of grease. Then tell him to undress outside! Patrick! Help! Help! Patrick! Patrick! Help! Patrick! No! Mama? Now she could be anywhere. - We have to find that bitch. - Let's go. We gotta get out of here now. Fuck! RECENTS DARLING Ingrid. Oh, God. Sofia. Sofia! Papa. - Mama... - We have to get out of here. Papa, call an ambulance! - We have to go now. - No, let go of me! They're dead, we have to leave. You're hurting me. Mama! Mom! Mom! Mom! Why are we running away? And how could we just leave Mama like that? Not right now, Sofi. Tell me! - Not right now. - You have to tell me now! Sofi! I want to know what the hell... I can't tell you right now! You fucking understand? Do you have good news or bad news? Unfortunately, the girl got away. But other than that, the news is good. Oh, I see. Come see me at my place. It'll be late. Don't worry about it. Us old folks don't sleep much. See you later. What is this place? Tell me where we are, I don't want to fucking stay here. It's just for tonight. Tomorrow, we'll find something better. Pa, why haven't we called the police yet? - 'Cause we can't. - Why not? They'd take me. But you haven't done anything wrong. Oh, enough. Wait, wait. Listen to me. We're in danger, or we wouldn't be in here. - We're lucky not to be dead too. - Just leave me alone. Wait, stop! Listen! Now shut up. And follow me. Good evening, Don Angelo. Good evening. Pause it there. Fuck, it's not him. How is that possible? The picture looks just like him. You have to fix this. Don Angelo wants him dead, and that brat too. Jesus, what a goddamn mess. You'd better hurry up, or we're dead. You understand what I'm sayin'? Okay, I get it. I'm on it. And tell Vituzzo. Tell him the bastard is still alive. THE CALL OF THE WILD THE CALL OF THE WILD BY JACK LONDON Papa? Papa, please. I can't take it anymore. Tell me what the fuck are we doing here! Why won't you answer me? That's enough. Okay, okay. It's okay. Before I was introduced to your mother, my whole life was different. I was a different person. Who were you? I wasn't a good person. You know of 'Ndrangheta? It's a Sicilian Mafia. And blood ties are the strongest thing if you come from a family that's part of it. There's no escape. They'd put a gun in your hand and tell you to shoot rival families. Either you die or the other person dies. My name is not Santo Romeo. My real name is Domenico Franzè. That's why you avoided having your picture taken, didn't you? Oh, God. I... I took one of you. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does! Because you made me believe a lie my whole life, and because of you, Mama is dead! What are you going to do? Sofia, I'm gonna need you to have faith in me. You're not to use it or answer it unless I'm the one who's calling. You promise? Wait for me here. I'll be back soon. Look at me. Nothing will happen to us. I swear to you. - Hakim. - Sofia. Come and get me now, please. What happened? The police are looking for you. - Are you all right? - I'm all right, don't worry. I'm coming for you. Tell me where you are. You know, I'm at the abandoned hotel by Speikboden bend. You know it? Yes, I-I got it. Is your dad with you? I don't know where he is, and I don't care. He's no longer my father. I don't want to have anything to do with him again. Please, just come... Don't worry, I'm on my way. Please come fast. I can't wait. What do you mean it wasn't him? They had a photo. They knew his face. And what exactly is a warning supposed to do? Now you have to help me do it. Hello? Who did it? I have nothing to do with this, I swear. They came here yesterday, they only stayed half an hour! I don't know anything. They'll kill me. I'll kill you as well, but first I'll make you suffer like a pig. If you tell me what I want to know, maybe you'll get to the hospital. It was Don Angelo who sent them. I didn't need you to tell me that, dickhead. I want to know who did it! Marino Gallo. Oh Lord, I'm dying. Go on. I know there were two of them. My daughter saw them. Please, Santo, call an ambulance... The name! It's Rudi Crisarà... Rudi Crisarà. Don Angelo's new right-hand man. Oh Lord, I'm dying! You have just one way to be saved. Pray to God. Hakim! Hurry up. Let's go. Sofia? Sofia? Sofia! Sofia! Hang on, Sofi. Head down, Sofia! Hakim! Run, Sofi. Go! - I said run, now! - Hakim... No! Where the fuck do you think you're going? Come here. Stop it. Shut up and I won't have to beat you. Calm down... What the fuck? Get your ass over here. That's it. Come on. Now, let's give Uncle something... Where do you think you're going? Where do you think you're gonna go? Fuck! That's it! Get in there. Fucking brat, little bitch. No, Franzè! - Turn away, Sofia. - No, Franzè. Don't do anything stupid! Don't do anything... Let's get out of here. About this Alto Adige business... I wish I'd been informed earlier. We are building this city. We can say it's our city. Please, sir. Let's avoid scandals. We have to be invisible, even for the banks. Fuck off about the banks. We have some 40 building sites in Northern Italy. We can't put everything at risk for some sort of vendetta, sir. A... - fucking vendetta, asshole? - Sorry... Franzè... he murdered your only brother. You should slit his throat with your own hands. Instead, you sit behind a desk counting money. Every time I look at you, I... What's that, huh? What's on your mind? That Franzè chose the wrong son to be killed. We're gonna have to get help. It's only a flesh wound, and we can't stop moving. Papa! There's some extra clothes there in the back. You can change later. - I'll meet you over there. - Okay. Sofi. - That's 17.30. - Bodies of Ingrid Gruber and her brother Patrick were found beaten to death in this remote homestead where the woman lived with her husband and daughter, who are now missing. Detectives cannot rule out any possibilities, and it is feared that... Papa, it's me. You can't drive. I'll take you. Where are we going? We're going to Milan. When will there be an end to this, Papa? It will be over when I finish something I started more than 20 years ago. He's killed Vituzzo. The guy with the restaurant in Bolzano. He knew he was associated with us. Oh, God. No. This situation gets more and more fucked up. Then he could track us. Will he? He isn't... a person looking to escape. He's an honorable man. Papa, why don't you drop this "honor story"? Papa, do you really want to risk it all for one man? Michele. Forgive me for mistreating you today. But there are some things that you can never understand. Do you trust in me? Yes, I do. Of course I do, Papa. Slow down a bit. Park over there. Before we go to Milan, there's one thing we have to do. Go ahead. Dr. Ferrario. I still haven't thanked you for the work you did with the faces. The facial recognition, yes? Did you happen to find your acquaintance? We found him. But it seems, he's vanished again. It appears he's in Milan, and he's unhappy with us. The facial recognition you did on the Internet... could you do that in real life, using surveillance cameras? Uh, surveillance cameras? Yes. Throughout Milan. With access to the public safety network, we can extend our search to a greater number of people. Is that possible? I worked for the state before opening up on my own. I know the right people. We would appreciate it greatly. And also for her too. I'm on it. More bloodshed in the hunt for Domenico Franzè, the 'Ndrangheta killer on the run since last night. Three more deaths appear to be linked to the criminal... MILAN ...who is now the most wanted man in Northern Italy. His daughter, Sofia, was seen at a service station near Merano. The police consider Franzè to be armed and very dangerous. FOR SALE Pull over. Okay, wait for me here. FOR SALE COME HERE Pa, is it really painful? No, I just need to breathe a little. Papa? Papa? Papa! Papa, answer. Can you hear me? Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. Fuck! PHARMACY Hey, please open the door. Please, I need help. Where can I find the doctor? We can't help you, get out of here. - No, I need a doctor. - Just go away. Let me in. I need to find a doctor. Leave now! Do you want all this? - Easy. Go easy. - Right, that's right. Pa. You're gonna be okay. Come on, move him... Quick, quick, quick! There she is. Well done. Hello, my love. If you're reading this letter, it means I'm dead. But that doesn't matter. Because if I can say that I have lived, it's all thanks to you. You, my love... you saved my life. A life that didn't deserve to be saved. Because it was full of nothing more than cruelty and violence. I didn't know what love was or the joy of what it was like to be loved. I lived to kill and killed to live. I was just waiting for my turn to die because I could no longer see the difference between life and death. I never expected that I would be saved. But I was wrong. Because even I, from the pit of hell, could still be blessed. I knew nothing about life, or about myself... until you came along. Your birth was my blessing. Sofia. My love. Whoops. What's going on? You were right. Your father wants us to keep looking for Franzè. He's so fucking predictable. Yes, he made me set up a much wider, much more extended search than before. It's complex. It's illegal. And it'll cost you. It's incredibly costly. Especially because I'm gonna have to bother a lot of people with the state. I could say he couldn't be found. No, he'd pick up on it. He always figures out what I do. Tell you what, let's do this. Give him whatever he wants but keep me informed at all times. I'm sorry it happened to you too. To have to live this life. Pass me one of those. We have to get out of here, as soon as possible. We have a few positions, all from last night. They're all between Quarto Oggiaro and Bovisa. We've located them. We also located a girl in an industrial area nearby. A warehouse that is a front for illegal abortions. I'll leave this to you. Move those things over before I leave. Move those over. I'm in a rush. Okay. I'm going. Shut the door and let's go. KEYS, BATTERY, CONTROL UNIT Where's the man and the girl? Where are they? I'll kill you just like your hot piece of... Stop. Stop right there! Hands up. Don't move! Now that they've found us, they won't stop until we're both dead. SULFUR That's why we must make the first move, Sofia. We have no choice. Kill to not be killed. This is a lesson I wouldn't have wanted to teach you. I have a precise plan but I can't do it on my own. I need you. Take this. What am I supposed to do now? Let your hand decide. It shouldn't feel foreign to you at all, but like it was meant to be a part of you. If you're using a knife, it means you're close to your opponent, therefore close to danger. To your death. Fear must be put aside to leave room for action. You wouldn't have time for a second shot, so the first one must be lethal. Go on, try a position. No. No. Always point the knife in front of you. You attack with the knife, you block with the knife. Stand diagonally. Never offer your body to your opponent. Always keep moving, use the other arm to keep your balance. If you hit him here on the flank... ...he'll feel excruciating pain, but most likely he'll survive. Hit here, the heart... The loss of consciousness will be immediate. In three seconds, he'll be dead. But if you hit him right in the jugular... your victim will have 30 seconds before suffocating in his own blood. The last face he sees will not be one of someone who loves him, but yours. No revenge is crueler. I found it. Quadra Capital. Here are the blueprints and layout of the building. They're on the website of the architectural firm that did the interior design. Good job. You think it'll be successful? Yes. Then what? Well, I have a friend in South Africa. We can stay there in the beginning. You and I. Mm-hmm. I keep thinking about Mom. Why did I have to take that photo? It's all my fault, Sofia, because of the life I lived. Forgive me. Don't feel guilty about it, Papa. You were just trying to survive. You're like Buck. THE CALL OF THE WILD You've read it? Yeah, we read it in middle school. This book was your favorite? I bought it at a fair. The cover drew me in. I trust you. It'll be okay. You can't be here. What are you doing with your phone? - Excuse me. I got lost. - What? I wanted to head to the city center - but the sat nav wasn't working. - Don't care. Just move it along. You can exit over there. I'm sorry. I'll leave now. Okay, you'll tell me later. Bye-bye. Keep your hands on the wheel and drive to the garage. Take a left turn over there. Park all the way down to the left. Okay. Get out. Come here. Go on. Move. Turn around. The code. Unlock it. Unlock it. - What was that? - What was that? The hell was that? Stop there! Everybody stay calm. Just do what he says. - Stop, let him go. - He's a dead man if you shoot! Put your gun on the ground. Let him go! I have nothing to do with this. Kill me, and your daughter will be next. Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Stop now! Man down! Look out! Stay there! Go, go, go, go, go! You, don't move! Run this way! Go, go, go! Go! Back! Sofi, turn left! Go now! Get out of the way! Focus, straight! It'll all be over soon enough. We got this today from Michele's number. That piece of shit got him. There was a message sent with the photo. You have an hour, you son of a bitch, to turn yourself in and confess to your crimes over the last 30 years. Give the names of all your affiliates, political protectors, with evidence, and most important, all the numbers to current bank accounts in Europe, London and South America, or I'll be forced to kill another one of your sons. I want to hear the news on TV before midnight tomorrow, or Michele is dead. But you do what I ask, and I'll let you know where you can find him alive. Call Ferrario. It's an abandoned rail yard. The cell tower picked up the phone for a second. Just enough time to send the photo before it was turned off. But we have the position. Rudi, you must not fail me again. Get out here. Copy that, boss. There's the van. Let's get out of here. Mino, in the van. Michele. Michele, it's me, Rudi. I came to free you. Behind the van! Where the fuck is he shooting from? You can't hide forever. Run! Get back, get back! That son of a... Where the fuck is he? - Here! I see him. - Where is he? Damn! Fuck. - He's comin' out! - Kill him! Kill that son of a bitch! Fuck. Do you really believe for a second Don Angelo would give up his fucking empire to save his own kid? My family was innocent. People like you and me... We shouldn't have a family. Please. Please. Please. I beg of you, a sip of water. I'm dying of thirst. Thank you. I'm so sorry for what happened to you, it was terrible. You did it, asshole. You did it with your whole family of mafia maniacs. It was all my father. Sofia. Your name is Sofia, isn't it? I swear I only found out afterwards what my father had done. I swear if I had known before... You didn't know that your father was a mafioso? You tell me. Did you even know who your father really was? I know who my dad is. I don't know what he told you, but it's all bullshit. Shut the hell up. Listen to me. You don't know anything. You think your dad's on some kind of righteous crusade, but he isn't. We're the victims, the Lo Biancos. That's bullshit! Your father murdered my brother. He's killed dozens of people, Sofia. He's an inhumane being, a criminal. I don't think you can even fathom... But you are different. Your future is not yet written. It's the future you imagined until three days ago. To have that gone forever... This is not your war, Sofia. You're not a Franzè. Your father had no choice. You did, but it's now or never. Please let me go. A-And you escape, save yourself. Please, just untie me. Sofia? Sofia, please. Please, just let me go, Sofia! Sofia, please! How many more people have to die, Sofia? Oh, please! Hello? Hey, sweetheart. It's me. Is everything all right? You sound strange. Things didn't go well, I'm sorry. Our plan didn't work out. It's Franzè. He's making the call from a cell in Agrate Brianza. He's on the move. What do you mean? What is going on, Papa? Are you hurt? You okay? The voice is feminine. Geolocated in a fixed position. That's his daughter. Let's get moving. Two squads. One for Franzè, and one for his daughter. Talk to me, Pa. I'm fine. But I have no choice now. Please come. Just come back. Do it for me. I can't, Sofi. You knew, didn't you, that it would never work out? But I hoped it would for your sake. Now, what are we gonna do? You don't have to do anything now, my love. I'd hoped there could be another way. But I was wrong. And now, the only way to be safe... ...is to make sure Don Angelo disappears forever from the face of the Earth. I have to do it now. Understand? What are you saying? I don't understand anymore. I had changed, Sofi. I had changed. I love you so much. And now I know you can survive without me. You know what will happen if you kill me, don't you? And how they will deal with your bitch of a daughter? You should never have touched my family. You should've left them in peace. Please, Papa. I beg you. I beg you. We were supposed to go to South Africa. You know you made a promise to me too. We were gonna go, just me and you. Please. Put your hands where I can see 'em! I've had wonderful years. I had a family. I had you. A miracle. Put your hands up! Hands up, I said! But it's only right that we settle the score now. Papa! Papa! Hands up! I said, put your hands up! - Clear. - All clear. Hello, Sofia. Here she is. I found her. Stand up. Don't worry, it's all over. Franzè, come with me. Well, thanks, but I don't like chocolate. How was your stay? What do you want? I spoke with the judge in your case. There are no charges against you at all. In the proceedings, you'll be acquitted. And it makes me really happy. Because you've been at the mercy of a madman, you've been abused. You and I, we have the same destiny. We've been made to pay for the sins of our fathers. Now we're liberated. Is that what you came all the way here for? No. I wanted to say that, as far as I'm concerned, the war between the Lo Bianco and Franzè... it's time to finally end. Now we're patched up. You, before long, will come of age. You'll get out of here and you can have a fresh start. If you ever need any help, why don't you come and visit me? You know, I'd really love to give you a hand. What's the plan this time? I'm not sure about this. I want to obliterate her. I want her to die with a rope squeezed around her neck, just like my father. "And closely akin to the visions was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest." "It filled him with a great unrest and strange desires." THE CALL OF THE WILD "It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what." "He would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him." "It might be, lying thus, that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand." "But he did not know why he did these various things." "He was impelled to do them... and did not reason about them at all." Talk to me. She's not here. What do you mean, she's not there? I said I wanted her dead. Well, she's not here. She must've run away. Okay, I-I'll call you back. Sofia. What's up? Something into you? How did you manage to get in? With your business card and a smile. I bet when it comes to girls in here, I'm not the first. I imagine you've come, uh, looking for the help I promised. Now what? Your truce is a bust, Michele Lo Bianco. And why is that? A brag? For it to work, it takes two of us. And the Franzès' rule hasn't ended. "Kill or be killed, this is the law." "Showing mercy was just a sign of weakness."
