He pointed out that although police training did not include counselling techniques, it has recommended that more advice is needed for officers dealing with such cases, and that a follow-up from social services should be a matter of course. After last night's murder in the Wilmslow area, now believed to be the sixth killing by the Hawk public pressure on the pollice is mounting. With the victim once again a mother of two children, questions are being asked about the direction of the police investigations into the killings in the South Manchester and Derbyshire area. Inspector Daybury, in overall charge of the investigation repeated his appeal to the public. -It says that... -INSPECTOR DAYBURY: He could be a lorry driver, a travelling salesman. Probably leads a normal life, perhaps a married man. And someone, wittingly or unwittingly, is shielding him. And I would like to appeal to the public, to anyone who has the slightest suspicion of a husband, boyfriend, a friend, however small, to come forward and let us know. Thank you.

And she feels part of their romance like, because she's been lending Norma her car. Actually, Mum didn't want to in the first place but she felt sorry for Norma, going on the bus at night with that maniac around, so she lent it her. If I slept with my wife I'd feel unfaithful. -Unfaithful? -To Norma. Absurd, isn't it? -Are you gonna murder your wife? -Stephen! Oh, of course not, I'm much too fond of her for that. Well, if you were you wouldn't be here. Well, are you going to leave her? Have you talked to her about it? I can't talk to her. Well, why not? Well, I... Well, I mean, do you talk to one another? Oh, We're happily married. (LAUGHING) What's so funny about that? (ALL LAUGHING) "We're happily married." Yes, well, we are. (ALL LAUGHING) Are you two gonna be happily married? Eh?

Jeff got it from this guy who works in police records. They know the bugger's car. Know it? How do you mean, know it? The time. The make. -I thought they knew something when they pulled me over. -Bollocks. Well, it were obvious they weren't just farting around checking lights and tyres. So, uh... What car are you riding now? He wants to know what they're looking for. I was in a Cavalier. Jeff told us after, they're checking all Escorts and Cavaliers. STEPHEN: Yeah. You listen to this. "You've been spotted 18 times in Moorside," this prize dick says to me. "Moorside?" I says. "Yeah, the red light district." He says. "Get away." I says. "Is it?" -(LAUGHING) -"How do you account for that?" this dick says. "Account for what?" I says. Shakin' in his fuckin' shoes. "I live on one side and I work on the other. "What do you expect me to do? Fucking drive around?" (LAUGHING) Dozy bastards. Don't you know why they call him the Hawk? He does what the bird does to animals it hunts.

You're cheating. -Look, see the hawk. -Where? -Just up there. See? There. -Oh, yeah. He's looking for something to eat. (CRACKLING OF FIRE) Right... I'll post that tomorrow. (SIGHS) -Oh, the dishes. -I'll do it. (CUTLERY CLINKING) It's been really nice coming back here. Hasn't it? Humongously boring! Don't be so bloody selfish. This holiday was for Mum. You really needed this holiday, didn't you Mum? (SIGHS) Yes. And I couldn't wish to spend it with two more lovely kids. (SIGHS) -Hey, how about a cup of tea? -I'll do it! Oh! -Um... -He'll never make it. No, but you know, we live in hope. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (PANTING) Got ya! Isn't it great Mum? Dad's here. He's found our secret place. -Oh... -MATTHEW: Oh, yeah! Goody bag, yeah! Whoo! Yay! JACKIE: Oh, yeah! Yay! I've got sweeties! Yeah! MATTHEW: Sweeties! I don't know what came over me. I've been worried sick. I didn't know what to do. Call the police or what. Police? I didn't know what you might do to 'em. Me? You don't remember, do you? What you were like in the hospital, after you'd had 'em, both of them? And what's the first thing I see? -I... -You shouldn't let 'em use it, love. It's bloody dangerous. MATTHEW: Is Dad coming back home now? ANNIE: No. He's staying with your Gran for a while. MATTHEW: Can I go and stay with Gran? ANNIE: No JACKIE: Are you separated? Susan says... ANNIE: I don't care what Susan says. "Susan says"! (HONKS) (DUCKS QUACKING) Your dad just needs to be away. He's going to need a lot of help from us. MATTHEW: Jackie! I cleared him. -I didn't mean to but I cleared him. -(MATTHEW PLAYING) I forgot about Jackie's birthday. (MATTHEW AND JACKIE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND) -I lied. -Oh, don't be daft, love. You didn't lie. You just... Look, are you sure about the other dates? Yes. If you want to tell the police you got that date wrong, then fine. But be careful. All Stephen wants is access to those kids. And you got to admit that's reasonable. Reasonable? He tried to kill me, Norma. Well, so did my ex. Doesn't mean he's a mass murderer. (MATTHEW SCREAMING AND PLAYING) Annie... Stephen rang me. He rang you? NORMA: About the kids. About everything. Of course I told him where to get off, but... Oh, don't you realise, love? If you go on behaving like this he's gonna get custody of those kids. What you mustn't do, is go on saying he's the killer. (KIDS PLAYING) I was going out tonight but I'll not bother. I think it's set for the day. Oh, it's not the bloody rain I'm frightened of. Haven't you heard? He's killed again. Just down the road. Prior's Park. A mother with two children, about your age. ANNIE: (ON PHONE) His name is Stephen Marsh. He's staying at number 5, on Lindsey Terrace. MAN ON PHONE: 5, Lindsey Terrace. Do you know the postcode? -He's here! -MAN ON PHONE: Madam... He's here. He's here now! MAN ON PHONE: Can you tell me where you're speaking from, Madam? -Um, I'm at address? Uh. -MAN ON PHONE: Madam? -MAN ON PHONE: Madam? -(THUNDER CRASHES) (PANTING) (SIREN WAILING) -MRS MARSH: The police have been around -ANNIE: Oh... Oh, thank God. (SIGHS) So, where have they taken him? MRS MARSH: Nowhere! MRS MARSH: He's in Stoke! He's been nowhere near Prior's Park! But aren't they arresting him? MRS MARSH: Arresting him! MRS MARSH: If they arrest anyone it should be you. The police know you're mad. You've tried this on with them before, haven't you? Well, we've had just about enough! When he comes back, he's going to a solicitor! Annie? Can you hear me, Annie? Annie? Annie! Everything's gonna be all right. I'll see your father. It'll be all right. -Mum, we're ready! -ANNIE: All right. -Bye, see you Mum. -Bye. Bye! Matthew, have you brushed your teeth? (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Now, it's diet Pepsi or popcorn, not both. -Diet Pepsi or popcorn. -(CHILDREN CHATTERING) -What time's he coming? -Um, half past three. You look great. Your old self. That's the way to play it. Custody? He doesn't stand a prayer! (NERVOUSLY LAUGHS) -Bye. -Ta-ra. (DOORBELL RINGS) STEPHEN: Hello, Annie. Oh, you just ignore me as usual. What did you want to see him about? I wanted to talk. MRS MARSH: Well, I'm not stopping you. To ask you to drop the solicitor. MRS MARSH: I told you. ANNIE: Stephen... I don't need dates or expense bills. Here we go. (SIGHS) I'll stand by you, I promise. I go over and over that night in my mind. You wanted to tell me, but I wouldn't let you. And then, if it hadn't been for Matthew... That night, when you accused me of being him, that hurt, love. And I had a go. Yeah. -Go? You call that a go? -You were driving me up the wall, love. You've been having one of your turns, haven't you, Annie love? You kneed me in the balls, and then you chucked me out. You know, I know from times before, that it doesn't make any difference what I say because you remember what you wanna remember, but you must remember that, love! MRS MARSH: He's been very patient with you, love. Why don't you tell her? Just let me, Mother. Annie, if you go in, they'll have you right as rain in a few week's time. In? I'm not going into hospital! You see, it's not up to you, love. It's too late. You see, in the hospital... It's the kids I'm frightened for. You don't know what you're like when you're like this. Oh, why don't we all have a nice cup of tea? Unless that's a thing of the past in this house? You made me favourite. Could you put the kettle on? STEPHEN: Ah... (FALLS DOWN) ANNIE: Stephen... Stephen... Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! (ANNIE SCREAMING) Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! (ANNIE'S VOICE ECHOES) BOY: Catch him! (CHILDREN CHATTER) -NORMA: You little swines! -MATTHEW: That wasn't going well. NORMA: Oh, God! (CHILD MUTTERING) (NORMA SIGHS) -OFFICER: Can I help you, madam? -NORMA: What's going on? -Sorry, I can't tell you. -Why have you stopped us? These children live here. (AMBULANCE SIREN) Sorry. I can't let you in. What's the ambulance for? This is my friend's house. Can you just tell me please, what's happening? If you'd just like to wait here... (CAMERA CLICKING) ...and she shouted help and I went in and there he was. He was lying on the floor. And he had blood all over him. -And I've never seen... He was such a kind man! -Sergeant, inside! MRS CROWTHER: He was innocent! He couldn't have done it! Look, I've nothing to say. You'll get a statement later. -(REPORTERS CLAMOURING) -Thank you very much. Thank you We will give our co-operation. There'll be a statement later! INSPECTOR DAYBURY: It's as conclusive as a fingerprint. We have a clear distinct tyre print from one of the murders. The one under the arches, by the canal. Which we think was from a G-registration car. Your husband's was a J and the prints are not what we're looking for. I don't know whether this makes it better or worse but it's not... He wasn't The Hawk. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Right, she's yours. This way, Mrs Marsh. (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) ANNIE: Stephen... (CELL DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR CLOSES) DOCTOR: I've not treated her in the intervening period. SOLICITOR 1: But do you believe she has psychotic tendencies? DOCTOR: Not at all. Mrs Marsh's conclusions may have been tragically wrong but they were based on an accumulation of evidence, - not paranoid delusions. -SOLICITOR 2: Inspector Daybury, in the light of the doctor's opinion do you maintain your position? INSPECTOR: It is the police view, that there is no reason to grant bail on this case. JUDGE: Let me ask you, Dr Seymour, would you say that Mrs Marsh is a danger to the public? DOCTOR: Absolutely not. -(CHATTERING IN COURT) -(BANGS GAVEL) JUDGE: I've heard the evidence and notwithstanding police concerns, I'm taking a wholly exceptional course. The court is willing to grant bail, on the following conditions. You will not associate with or attempt to contact members of your husband's family... (CAR HONKING LOUDLY) NORMA: Annie! Annie! Are you okay, love? Yeah. Thanks for coming. Okay. -Let's go for a drink. -Where do you wanna go? -Royal Hotel. -Birchgate? Yeah. That's right. Is this a good idea, Annie? I just want to go back there, where it all began. (STARTS ENGINE) Annie! He killed Stephen as surely as I did! You can't take the law into your own hands. Annie! I killed the wrong man, didn't I? (FIRE CRACKLING) You're always borrowing things from our shed. Like Stephen's hammer. What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own, remember? You killed all those women. Can I use the phone? It's an emergency! Life's a fuckin' emergency love! That G-registration car, the one the police were looking for, that was yours, wasn't it? That was the car you were so anxious to get rid off that night, the night that I was here. The car you used when you killed. -Don't move! -Annie... I might blind you or I might not. It's not knowing, that's the worst, isn't it? You don't understand! She's gone crazy! She's gonna kill him! Eileen! Look, I have to ring you back. See, I don't care what happens to me now. I just want the truth. I'll tell you the truth, Annie. Stephen used to borrow that car. Other cars. Why? Because if your own car is seen too much in the red light district, they pick you up. Police! It's urgent! It was him, I swear it. I thought he was anxious to get rid of it because of the scam. He was always borrowing me car. You're lying! It's the truth! I swear it! The police picked me up that night, the night of the murder! Remember the prize dick? It was on the night of the murder. It was minutes after. I wasn't in that Cavalier! I was in a red one. -Ask the police! -(SPIKE CLATTERS) They picked me up, they tore the car apart, they tore me apart! Ask them, ask the fucking police! Where is it now, that car? We sold it for scrap. It's on the way to the crusher now. No, Annie! No! Annie, stop the car! Let's talk about it. Annie, slow down. You've just got out on bail! -(TYRES SQUEAL) -NORMA: Where're we going? INSPECTOR: Right! We're on our way! We're on our way! Sodding psychiatrists! Come on, Jo. Mickey, move it! Not mad! No risk to the public! (TYRES SCREECHING AND HONKING) Shit! Three, zero, Charlie, one... (SIRENS WAILING) Annie, just slow down, he's behind us. Three, zero. MAN ON RADIO: Charlie, one, O, nine... (SIRENS WAILING) (TYRES SCREECHING) East Lancashire Police. You have a stolen car. Matt, stop the line. (SIRENS WAILING IN THE DISTANCE) (DOOR CLOSING) What are those? They're called tyres, lady. They're round, made of rubber and you fit 'em on wheels. INSPECTOR: Only the Marsh brothers had access to the car. Which is now down to a log book, four tyres and some upholstery. Ken was with us, picked up under suspicion in Moorside. And we have a witness from the pub, who's positive that Stephen drove it that night when this tyre print was picked up from the murder scene. This print on off-side rear was recovered from the scrap plant... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) How could he go back to his kids? How could she go on covering up for him? That's what get's me. I mean. She must have known. Mustn't she? -No you can't say that. -Oh, come on. -MAN: Mickey! Mickey! -She fucking knew it! -WOMAN: How can you say, "of course"? -MAN: She knew it. I've booked a hotel room for you. When the press find out who your husband was... I can handle them. I'm sure you can. Will you take Mrs Marsh home, please. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY) Matthew! Mum! Mum! Mum!
