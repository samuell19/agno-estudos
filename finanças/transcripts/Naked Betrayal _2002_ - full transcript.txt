We couldn't stop. You're not gonna be able to stop. I know what you mean. No, you don't. Steven, Jesus. Anyway, we started gambling on our own. And we were good. We were real good. Man, I can't lose. JACK: We lost our asses thinking that way. And the more we lost, the more money Mack kept giving us. So he was just helping out. JACK: No, he was sucking us in. Steven, pretty soon we owed him so much money we couldn't get out. He owned us. So what happened to Simon? I guess he figured he was a dead man. He just didn't want to give Mack the chance, so he killed himself. So he cracked. Yeah, he cracked. He lost everything. Then he lost his house, his car. Steven, he lost his life. And you could be next. No way, man. No. I'm on it. I'm on the ball. I got it. Smarten up, man. If Mack wants you, he will find a way to reel you in. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mind if I sit down? Free country.

You don't even know if he'll do it. If he's anything like his brother, he'll do it. If he's not? I faith in Claudia. No man can resist her. Well, let's hope she's his type. MACK: She's every man's type. Besides, a gave him a bunch of money. They're gonna have a great time. All right. Well, just keep me informed. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Hello, Mr. Delgado. Come have a seat.

He's got the fever. [MUSIC PLAYING] MACK: Is he ready to meet with me? Yes, he will meet with you this afternoon. Good. Good. In the meantime, I'd like you to get acquainted with Suzanne. She's gonna help us secure our little Mr. Miano problem. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Yeah, hold on. Look, I don't know who you are or where you came from, but let's get one thing straight. Mack is mine. I'm number one here, and don't you forget that. Well, I thought Mack's wife was number one. You're so cute. Actually, Mack's wife is in Aspen, and she's probably shagging the ski instructor right now. Sounds fun. Why don't you and I just stick to business? Well, I'm all about business. And the reason I got this job is because of my impressive resume. Really? I'm just in it for the money, honey. You don't have to worry about me. Since we are going to be working together, maybe we should get better acquainted. So where you been all week, huh? I told you man, I went to visit a friend. Just went out of town for a little while. You're lying. - I am not lying. - You're lying. No, I'm not. Besides, it's none of your business. Dad's worried about you. Hell Steven, you know what? I'm worried about you. - You know what? Tell him not to. I'm fine. Why don't you tell him yourself? I'll bet he'd prefer that. Hey. I've gotten good at this, buddy. All right. Indulge me. Pick a card. - No. - Pick a card, come on. - No, this is stupid. Come on. Just do it. I Need some practice. Look at it. Give it back to me. OK. Normal deck. Shuffle, shuffle. All right. Boom, queen of diamonds. Is that it? Is that your card? Come on. What's up with you, man? Come on. Sal told me he saw you with a girl. You have a problem with that? One of Mack's girls. So? So? That's how he entices you, beautiful women and money. We talked about this. Man, I know what you're thinking. I'm not getting tied up or mixed up. It's-- it was a date with a hot chick. That's it. No strings. Just watch out they don't try to con you in taking a trip to Vegas. - Vegas? - Yeah. No way, buddy. You know me. I'm not going anywhere where you can fry an egg on the sidewalk. I'm a hometown boy, that's it. You know it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello Steve. Glad you decided to meet me after your brother's demise there. Let's, uh, keep him out of this, huh? Yeah, you got it. So, uh, I guess you're aware of the big poker game tomorrow. Yeah. Here's the deal. I go ahead and front the money, you win $250,000. That's 25% of the million. STEVE: And if I lose? Let's just say you'll owe me. OK. One game. That's it, one game. Hey, don't be so hasty. You might enjoy the money and the fringe benefits. You know what? I'm gonna leave you in the hands of these capable women right here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Here we go again! Word's out your brother's playing in the big game tomorrow. What's that? What, there's a game tomorrow? - Yeah. It's really a private affair. I mean, there are gamblers coming in from all over just to-- just to bet on it. How come I haven't heard about it? It's a pretty underground group, you know? As I was saying, it's pretty hush-hush. You say Steve's playing? Word is is that he's Mack's man. [DOORBELL RINGING] I told you, I don't need you. I just came by to see how you were doing. I'm fine, thanks. Now goodbye. You've been drunk every night this week. You're spending money like water. So you're spying on me now?

No, I didn't promise you anything. You're gonna get yourself killed. It's one game. JACK: It's a mistake. One game, that's all I agreed to. And if you lose? If I win? Steven, these guys are high rollers. They're really good. Jesus, man. Have a little faith in me, will you? Come on. If I win, it's a quarter of a million in my pockets. Mine. And you did it. You did it and you won. That was pure luck. No. No. Man, gambling is all I know. JACK: Well, this one game could ruin your life. That's a chance I have to take, all right? I'm tired of being broke!

He can set them up anytime he wants. Look man, I can't-- I can't handle the pressure. It's too much too soon. [MUSIC PLAYING] He's gonna want his money back pretty soon. I'll gold. I can't do it. You won't have to. What do you mean? - I'll play. - No. No. - Yeah, I'm going to. Look, you're not borrowing from Mack. I don't need Mack. Where are you gonna get that kind of money? I've got money. No, no. I can't allow it. JACK: Listen to me. No. I know the only reason that you got into gambling was 'cause of me. I mean, I haven't been a stellar role model big brother for you. But I've been doing this a lot longer than you, and that's why I'm doing it. And when this is over, I want your assurances that you're out. All right. All right. I want your word. STEVE: All right. You got it. [SNICKERING] Your game has improved since the last time we played, William. It's like most games, you know? You've just got to be one step ahead of the competition. That you do. So I hear your bid for re-election is in the bag. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, yeah. In fact, some of the contributions I've been getting are downright inspiring. Bob, remember that trip to Mexico last month? Oh, yes sir. We were on a fact finding mission for the new trade bill. Very good, Bob. They've got a great sport down there, cockfighting. You ever hear of it? Yeah, it's two roosters duel to death. Yeah, yeah. 'Course, everybody's read about cockfighting, but until you've actually seen the game, you haven't really lived. I'm telling you, watching the blood spatter, the money going down in the ring. Fight to the death. Yeah. Unfortunately, cockfighting is outlawed here in the United States. Too bad too, you know? Very exhilarating game. Well, I don't know much about it. What I know about is poker. Well, you know, your game has been a little off lately, Mack. You know, you might consider getting in another line of work. Look, it's just a run of bad luck. It'll change. I promise. [SNICKERING] Yeah, a very long run. Listen, um-- you know, your contributions lately to my campaign, they've been getting lower and lower, haven't they? Just a couple of bad investments. It'll change. You know how badly I need that money for my campaign to keep it running? I know. Oh yeah? Yeah? Well, let me put it this way. I gave you this territory, didn't I? I'm afraid you're not living up to your potential. Look, I got this ringer, the one I told you about. He's gonna get us our money. So you've got this guy who gambled for you last time and lost gambling for us again? That's a fool's play, Mack. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't bullshit me, man. Nothing gets past me, you know that. Hey, he's good. He's got a gift. I've seen it. - Yeah? Well, he better have, because otherwise our relationship is gonna be permanently terminated. OK, he will. If we lose, you know we all take the fall, and I cannot absorb that loss. You got my word. Once a gambler, always a gambler. Come on, Bob. Leaving so soon Senator? As a matter of fact, I do have an office to go to. It's been a pleasure, Alexandria. Oh, the pleasure is all ours. You're a lucky man, Mack. Just hope this luck doesn't run out on you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Alexandria. He's not here. What makes you think I'm looking for my husband? Can't a girl just have a drink? OK, sorry. What will you have? Make mine a Martini. Make it a biting one, would you? Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why would a woman like me stay married to a guy like Mack? He's such an egotistical bastard. Maybe you're just in it for the money. OK. That's fair. So what are you drinking? That's all right. I got it, thanks. Oh, I'll get it. I'm loaded, remember? Hey, one for my new friend. So what'd you say your name was? I didn't. Well, what was your name then? Steven. Aren't you the guy that's gambling for that bullshit of a husband of mine these days? Yeah. [MUSIC - LONESOME KINGS, "JUDGMENT DAY"] Four aces.

I have a proposition for you that would guarantee you could by three of those babies. I'm all ears, lady. Shit. I fold. [HEART BEATING] Come on, deal them up. Thought I'd find you here. Just trying to make a little extra cash. I knew you didn't have it. MAN: You want to cut in, Steve? Yes. Yes, I do. In fact, I want to make the stakes a little higher. Where'd you get that kind of cash? MAN: Mack wants to see you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Gentlemen. Glad you could join us. But we didn't have a choice, did we Mack? Oh. Senator, meet the Miano brothers. Steve, Jack. Just want to make sure you know how important this game is to us. Yeah, we know. No, you don't know. Mack, you said one game, now he owes you. Let it go. Your brother owes me a lot of money, and I intend to get it back at the next poker game. You don't own me, Mack. If he loses, he'll never be able to repay you, and you know that. Mack, is there gonna be a problem? No, there's not gonna be a problem, is there Steven? I'm ought to keep Jack here for a little bit of insurance. Well, let's not get messy with a staff, eh? Good day, gentlemen. Mack, last chance. I knew it. I knew it! What did I tell you about Mack? It's all or nothing. There's no halfway. Don't say a word. Now you've got to go out there and you've got to play, and you've got to win. I'll win. Mack wants you two separated. What? Why? Mack's orders. Hey, take it easy! Hello Senator. Just checking in to make sure everything's under control. Yeah, everything's under control. You've got nothing to worry about. Ah, good. That's what I want to hear. MACK: We're almost ready to go. All right. Call me as soon as the game's over. I want to feel good about my recent investment. What do you mean? I already spent some of my winnings. Shouldn't be so eager to spend till the money is in hand. Yeah, but it will be, won't it? I mean, otherwise it's your life on the line. Besides, you made me a promise. Yeah, but-- Listen, I've given you plenty of opportunities to make money in other areas. I know, but-- No, no. No buts about it. Mack, you've been losing a lot lately. But I know you're not gonna lose this one. Right? Goodbye. I like that kid. Hey, bring me the brothers. [DOOR OPENING] Have a seat, gentlemen. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] leaving it up to you. I thought I'd remind you of the importance of this game. Yeah, we know. Just so you know, Jack will be staying here. What? Just a little incentive for you to win. You know what? If something happens to him, you hurt him-- Well, if you win, of course not. But if you lose-- What? You're going to kill me, Mack? Oh, you're really smart, Jack. Come on, we've got a game to attend to. [MUSIC PLAYING] We'll hang out here till the game's over. He won't have a chance. Good idea. I need a stiff one. You know, I can't believe I thought that sleaze was gonna leave his wife. He was playing me the whole time. If it isn't me, the good old sleaze. CLAUDIA: Mack. What are you doing with my collateral? You know what? I've been doing some research of my own, and the Senator is not gonna be happy when he finds out that you have an offshore account worth $10 million in assets. He won't. You have nothing. Well I've got something. I've got a riddle for you, Mack. What does our relationship and the way you do business have in common? They're both over. You haven't exactly been forthright with me, have you Mack? I've told you everything. [LAUGHTER] Always with the crap even now. I told you nothing gets by me, didn't I tell you that? Nothing. Bob, handcuff him till I figure out what to do with this human piece of garbage. MACK: I don't understand. You don't huh? Well, I, uh, have been informed that you've been taking a lot of my money and filtering it into a foreign account, several million worth. MACK: That's a lie. Oh yeah? Well, I've got faxes of all the transmissions to prove it. In fact, uh, I sent Bob over there. It's all true. You were planning on leaving the country. See, I knew you were cheating on me with Claudia, so I had my own girl Suzanne, who easily turned on me when you seduced her with your money-- well, our money. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: When love beckons to you, follow him. When love beckons to you, follow him. MACK: Listen. Shut up. You think I'm a fool? You were planning on leaving the country and living off your foreign account while you left me here in debt. Mack, a little greed's all right, but you are a glutton. So now two things are gonna happen immediately. One, you're gonna transfer all that money back into my campaign account. And two, you leave the country and hope to God I never see your face again. MACK: Believe me, you won't. And I want a divorce. Good call. Bob, get him out of the car. I want to make sure that transfer happens first thing in the morning. Let's go. All right. Last bit of unfinished business, what to do with you three. ALEXANDRA: Give them a break. I'll make it up to you. Yes, I believe you will. All right, you've got a deal. Alexandra, it's a dangerous neighborhood. What do you say I walk you to your car? Oh, I do have one last demand for you. Don't forget to vote next election day. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WORDLESS SINGING] That was close. Mack could have gotten us into a lot of trouble. Yeah, well he's not gonna be trouble anymore. We sent his bags packing right out of the country. Now what about Alexandria? I think she knows too much. Well you know, she isn't really a threat. She's, um, more of a confidant really. We go way back. I trust your judgment, Senator. No, no, she's a very smart woman. Might actually make an excellent senator's wife someday. You can't be serious. You never know. Well, I guess I'd better be going. I'm going out to dinner with my family tonight. It's my wife's birthday. Well, you be sure and wish a happy to Gigi and kiss the kids for me, will you? Sure thing, Senator. All right. Take care, Bob. Good day. Don't speed. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WORDLESS SINGING] [SINGING] Here we go again! [WORDLESS SINGING] [MUSIC - LONESOME KINGS, "JUDGMENT DAY"] [MUSIC - LONESOME KINGS, "JUDGMENT DAY"] [SINGING] Don't try to save me from the sings I commit or tell me about those things you think I should quit. 'Cause I'm a man living how I choose. Don't give a damn if I'm born to lose. I'll just take what comes my way on Judgment Day. On Judgment Day they're gonna lay my body down. But I'll be living somewhere deep under the ground. And on my tombstone the epitaph will read that they couldn't take the devil out of me. I won't take heed to any man trying to break me of the person I am. Do the things that I want to do. Don't ever want to end up like you. I'll just take what comes my way on Judgment Day. On Judgment Day they're gonna lay my body down. But I'll be living somewhere deep under the ground. And on my tombstone the epitaph will read that they couldn't take the devil out of me. I got regrets for some of my mistakes, parts of my life I wish I could erase. But I can't change the things I've done. I guess you can't please everyone. You just take what comes your way on Judgment Day. On Judgment Day they're gonna lay my body down. But I'll be living somewhere deep under the ground. And on my tombstone the epitaph will read that they couldn't take the devil out of me. I've always been just a little insane. I got sin flowing through my veins. I got the devil talking in my ear. And he's telling me not to fear and just to take what comes my way on Judgment Day. On Judgment Day they're gonna lay my body down. But I'll be living somewhere deep under the ground. And on my tombstone the epitaph will read that they couldn't take the devil out of me. They couldn't take the devil out of me. They couldn't take the devil out of me. When on my tombstone the epitaph will read that they couldn't take the devil out of me. Don't try to save me from the sins I commit. Or tell me about the things you think I should quit. 'Cause I'm a man living how I choose. Don't give a damn if I'm born to lose. I'll just take what comes my way on Judgment Day. On Judgment Day they're gonna lay my body down.
