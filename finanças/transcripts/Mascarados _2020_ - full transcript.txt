MASQUERADES Gotta rest a bit, right? Are you tired already? Yup. A little tired. Where are you from? From São Paulo. I'm Vinícius. I'm Marcos. This is the famous Capybara. What's up, brother? - And this is Ley. What's up, Vinícius. So, you're from São Paulo? I'm from Minas. Hey. Cool. And you, where are you from? We're from right here, Pirenópolis. It's been already six years that I´m here. Who are you working for? For Zé Fernandes. He's our boss too. Yeah... He doesn't have a good reputation, brother. Good Lord... He's all scam and nothing more. Not a good payer... All he does is stall. Maurinei, try that other one up there... It's looser. Cool? Break that one over there... - He's gonna break it... But if you open this one down here… You think so? - Yeah. That was helped, it's dry... He can open this one up. To tag or not the masquerades of the Feast of the Holy Spirit? Bless mother. God bless you, son. The discussion takes over the streets of the historic city. I'm against it. I'm against it. I think it's a matter of talking... ...with the community, and making them understand that it's for the continuity of the festivity. Since 2011 the civil and military police demand the identification of the masquerades during the Feast of the Holy Spirit, when the horse parade happens. According to the Legislation 720/ 2012, penal code rules will be applied to the masked that exceeds his involvement in the festivities. Damn, Marciley, what took you so long? I was at Luquinha's. Hey. I'm going out. Please, watch Luiz Henrique for me. He's fed. Was he nursed? Yes. You go, ma'am. Oh, Big Hook... I ran into Gilmar Capybara, crazy as usual, in front of the City hall. Can you believe it? Ha! He was wasted as hell, the boy. Really? He and a thousand masked guys, or so. Think about it. Things are gonna get ugly, dude. Till the end of the day, wanna bet? It's crowded with the police. The police won't be able to stop them. You should go there and see it. Nope. I'm staying right here. Don't wanna go there. I cannot risk going to jail, are you insane? Nothing will happen to you. Capybara is mad, you can see it, right? It's crowded with the police, as usual. And you´re even crazier, hanging out with them. What can I do? It's like I was telling you. It's a feast tradition. If we don't do it, we'll lose the feast. So, they'll break City Hall down today then. Hmm... I want a new one. For sure. You can come! You can come! Come. You can come! Left, Left. Left, Left, Left! You can come! You can come! Come, come. You can come! Great! Good! Are you done? I'm done. Hey, let's have one with us later. Cool. I'll pay you one at Tonho's bar. Thank you. And if somebody loved me like she do me... She do me, yes, she does... Don't let me down... Don't let me down... Don't let me down... Don't let me down... I'm in love for the first time... It's 7 hours and 13 minutes in Pirenópolis. I'm in love for the first time... Today my hug goes to miss Rosineide and her sons. Hello High Bonfim! Loving embraces also to... ...my friend Divina and my friend Tico. A Kat Sound offering, Bonfim Street, number 45. Stay now with the golden throats of Brazil, Milionário and José Rico. I'm a different kinda man Who thinks about nothing I've never loved in my life I've never had a home I recognize a great mistake I'm all wrong till the end I don´t think of the comments Of what others say about me I have a heart of stone I don't see me as defeated I've never known love So I wouldn't be destroyed Money is worth more Because there are no friends My love is only mother’s Who loves her son so dearly Heart... Do you want me do it for you? I can't... Let me do it for you, then. Play with mine, for now. But don't hit me then, huh. - Ok. Oh, it's transformed, see. Let's go. Let's fight. Go, go. I'm the strongest after all. Stop shooting me! You have to be a good loser. What for? You're so awful, boy. - Did you like it? Watch this, watch it... Watch this, brother. Stay tuned. Ouch, fuck! Go ahead. - Of course. Who taught you? Your daddy? Stop tripping, man. Now you lost it, damn it. - You wish. Your thing is carrying stones! Watch this. Is your family in this too? It's passed on generations, you know? From the little ones to the eldest. My grandpa died working in the quarry. But who owns the quarry? The municipal government. Actually, the municipality leases it to the bosses, you know? And the bosses sell it on the market. We ourselves don´t get any cut. At the end of the day, we earn very little. What's up, Capybara! Yeah, man. I'm here, resting a bit. Yeah... Are you crazy? There's no comparison. I've been there for 13 years. You've there for only six years, man. My small body is a little more worn out indeed. Hmm... Yeah, man. I won't be able to go to the match. I wish I could, but my old lady won't let me go. So, root for us then, man. Go! Go Guarani! With so much pride! With so much love! It's a penalty kick. I believe! I believe! I believe! I'll send you the shipping really early in the morning. Cool, brother? No, no, no. I think the green one is best. The view from the pool will be more pleasant. Exactly. I know you have good taste, sir. But don't you worry. I'll send you the sum. It won't be expensive at all for you, sir. So, are we settled? Right, alrighty! Great, see you, brother. Bye. Hey, excuse me. I came because... We need to settle the days I've worked for you... ...at the quarry. To settle? - Yes. We don't settle, things like that here. It's not like that, get it? Payment is in every two weeks. If there's money. If not, it's in every 30 days. You go back there and work 15 days. Come back here in 15 days. And then we settle things. Hey, Vinícius. How are you feeling about the city and all? Well... I'm... I'm looking for a job that gives me more satisfaction, you know? Hmm... The quarry is a bit complicated. Oh! Yeah... I'm looking for a job that can make me happy. You have so much joy in making these masks. I want something that brings me joy too. Indeed, I have so much joy. So very much. For me it's a great satisfaction... ...and so much pleasure, ...to do this artwork, These masks... Because they guarantee... They give freedom to so many people... For two, three days. The guys in the quarry can't stop talking about the feast. I'd like to see it. Take a mask and go to the feast. You're so young! I'm quite old and so, but... One of these days I... I'll take a mask and go party. Excuse me, let's take a step back. Let people work... It's wet... Take a step back... It's dangerous... In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. It's falling down. Open it up. Wow! Release the masquerades, please. Release the masquerades, gate! Our greetings to all families who offered the traditional feast dinner. Thank you very much! Without you our feast wouldn't have the same spark, for sure! Thank you very much for your kindness and support for the horse parade 2018. People are asking to serve the snacks to the horse men. To use the break, with the masquerades. OK!You can serve the snacks, thank you. To the responsible for serving the horse men's snacks... This is the time, please. Attention please, masquerades, it's time for you to leave the field, So we can continue. Please masquerades, leave the field. People, the kings are asking to focus on evacuating the masquerades. Let's go, let's go, then! Wait, wait. You get here and… You're losing time, men. You're taking too long, man. Let's go, Let's go, Let's go! You're taking too long... Let's go or the party will be over and it's only once a year. You were stalling before, and now you want us to hurry up. On what basis? Where's my cigarette? Today it will be mind-blowing down there. Let’s go, let’s go. - Let me take my last zip. The party is ours to make, man. Let’s go! - Come on! Come on! You take way too long Ley. Hi Zé... Did you come to pay us? How am I going to pay you? There's no money left. With that heavy rain. I came to tell you that I'm closing the quarry. How was your day at the quarry Marcos? Oh, mom... It was not good. The boss laid us off... He dismissed us. He said the pit is full of water. That he wasn't making any money. And now? What are you going to do? The day after tomorrow I'll go to the sawmill to settle the rest of the business I have with him. You see… I've worked there for 13 years, all lost. I'm leaving with nothing at all. They never signed my work permits. And (she) left… Like a child, I screamed in the dark… Frightened, worried and hurt, I cried in vain… But hope has smiled at me again… I'll continue… To search for this myth that Made me know what love is. And most of the time we're caught off guard, So helpless, so in need of passion… And when someone comes into our lives… We surrender our body and soul… Hey, Marciley, the other day when the police came by, they broke in, pointed a gun to my head. Oh, they must be after me, there´s no other reason. Good Lord, it’s insane. But at the Ranch, at the entrance, I saw… A security guard beating so many men up. It's what they do... They take advantage of their uniforms. That’s what I’ve told you about. And the rice? Almost ready. Then I’m going to put the meat on the grill. As you... ...Prepare the rice. I bought an Ice for you, because I know you like it. Start preparing it then and I’ll join you soon. Cool. Was it just Tiago and you? - Yes, just Tiago and me. Let’s see what happens to us, if tomorrow is a better day. If we can sort something out, Then we’ll have a better idea. We're all waiting, right, Mrs. Neide. - That's right, son. It ended with Pirenópolis, with all joy… Can I borrow this little fork? - Yes. Come Curucucu. Curucucu! - Where's the money? Curucucu! Here, take it. Take this little bite of beef. Take it with your hand, love. - It's hot. Let me blow it for you. Take it. Wow, so crazy Zé... Look, there is our Bonfim! This place is so insane, man. I've been here for six years, it's the first time I come here. Are you serious, man? Dead serious. - Really? Yeah, man... All that is good doesn't last, right? Brother, let's make it good in our lives. We too deserve more than carrying rocks. Fuck, son of a bitch. Do you wanna fuck me, mother fucker? You took too long, fuck!
