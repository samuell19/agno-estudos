Hello. I just.. I'm so clumsy. - I-I'm sorry. - Thank you. A-alright. Y-you are gorgeous. Mm-hmm. Oh, God. One day. Celestrial, I came as soon as I could. Oh, girl, you look over. - These are for you, doll. - Oh, thank you, sugar. - Come, sit down. - Okay. (Celestrial) Found a motif. Girl, have I got news for you. So, what's the 411? Girl, you will never believe what I've seen. Put your hand on the ball. [crystal ball buzzes] Your house is in Scorpio. Gorgeous. Your moon is rising perfectly. Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere there is a meteor crossing your asteroid belt. - Is that good? - 'It's all good.' Tonight is your special night, child. Special in what way? Let's consult the tarot daddy, shall we? And your card says love. Tasty. - I knew it. - Ugh! Celestrial, please reshuffle those cards. I see an explosion of love. Or maybe just an explosion. This last year, my love life has been a disaster. - What about Lamar? - Lamar? I can't wear a pager for him. Girl, you are a tad tough on men. Excuze? Girl, you've got to give it up to somebody. Celestrial, I have given it up. I have twirled it and swirled it in many directions. I need someone who's...impulsive, exciting. Who knows your thoughts before you say them. Exactly. That's who I'm seeing right here, darling. Where? Oh, good glamour, girl. He's a Virgo. And he's headed right towards you. Oh! Oh, no. I hope this is not another head-on collision. (Celestrial) 'Girl, just be happy if you get you a man tonight.' [instrumental music] (Frankie) 'Now, look at that girl over there in white. Oh, my God!' (Hop) 'Gosh. Man, that girl got an ass like a smoke tail.' [indistinct chatter] 'Yo, yo, why is it that the fine ones are always' hangin' out with the Frankenstein ones? No competition. Psst. Excuse me, miss. How you doin'? Oh, look at the body on this one. Oh, my goodness. Look at them damn feet though, man. Woman must wear about a 12. Yo, but you know what they say about women with big feet. Wrong gender, Hop. Now, do y'all mind? How come every time we come down here y'all spend the whole time talkin' trash? Oh, come on, man. Half these girls are down here because they're doin' the same thing that we are doin'. Ass watching. - Even your tiny ass. - Hear what I said? Tim, Tim, Tim. I got a question for you, Tim. When was the last time you had a date? I'll take that one for a hundred, Alex. Five months ago. And that was by accident. - Oh. - I'm telling you, man. Yo, ever since Denise left his ass co-sign has been spending so much time home alone we need to start calling him Macaulay Culkin. Oh, look, look, look. [gibberish] I told y'all about that co-sign shit, okay? I don't care how good the lovin' is you can't be co-signin' for no car. - Word. - Word. 'And if she dumped me' I'd sure as hell get that sweet ride back. - Hey, fuck all of y'all. Okay? - Mm-hmm. Whoo, 12 o'clock. - 'Mmm-hmm!' - 'Whoo!' What? She's thick too. Just like a like, thick like a stallion. I'm gonna ride her like a horse. Yeah, Like a h.. Woo! Like a.. Like a.. [imitates neighing] Man, can y'all just chill, man, for once? Come on, man. I mean, get down on the vibe. The music. Tim.. ...your words have been well spoken, my brother. We will leave you to sojourn with the jazzical expressions whilst we venture forth into the land of punani. Peace to you, my sensitive one. I'll drink to that. Excuse me, is this seat taken? No, it's not. If you.. Whoa! - Whoa! - My bad, yo. If you want to sit there, it's not taken. Um, do you come here often? (Woo) But Celestrial might be right. If she's so psychic, how come she don't know whether she's a boy or a girl? - She's everything. - Okay, she.. She's gonna have you just as confused as she is. She's the best. Are you goin' out with me tonight? Baby cousin, I've told you once, twice. Now, this is the third time today. Lenny is coming over tonight. He's planned something special. Oh, special for Lenny is a gallon of Nightyard and a bucket of chicken. Ha ha ha. You are going to Shakim's block party this evening, right? - No. - Woo.. - Ahem! - What is this? What? (Woo) 'Who gave you this?' My Lenny. - That's nasty. - You're just jealous. - It's cute. - Listen.. We can either go to The Venus or to The Mercury. And I wanna borrow a couple of your outfits. - What are you gonna wear? - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute, do you need an Ebonic translation? I ain't wearin' nothin' 'cause I ain't goin' nowhere. Woo, don't stick that key in that door, okay? Don't walk in, don't go in there. We gonna fight. Ask Lenny if we can borrow his car. - Gee.. - Are you kidding? G-give me that. Let me see. - 'Say that shit.' - 'That's right.' 'Whatever I say it's right' I'll ride you like one of them go-go dancers on "Soul Train." (man on TV) 'Get the fuck up off me, man. Why you touchin' me like that?' I like to keep my Evergreens very dark toward the base. Home alone, my ass. [telephone dialing] - 'Hello.' - Hey, Michelle. How you doin'? I was just wonderin', what are you doin' tonight? - 'Who is this?' - Excuse me? You're a trip, "who is this?" You gonna ask me who this is? Girl, you know.. Hello? Hello? I forgot Nene is having a party at the Soul Kitchen. We can go there first. Woo...I told you me and Lenny.. And lower halfway and squeeze up. And one.. ...two, three, four, five.. '...six, seven, eight..' [telephone rings] - Hello. - 'Tim!' Thank God, man. Hey, buddy, it's Lenny. Uh, I need you.. Hey, how you doin', brother? Good. Look, I need you to do me a little favor, man. I-I need you to hang out with Claudette's cousin tonight. What's wrong with her, man? - She look like an anteater? - No, man. Look, Claudette just got off her cycle. You know what I'm sayin'? Ah, don't you think that's a little bit more information than I need right now? Alright. We're trying to get a, a quality time in together. So, why don't you just go on home? Hey, what difference does it make, man? You ain't doin' nothing. Yeah, but I know you though, man. You big dusty dickhead. 'What, you think I needed to call your ass, huh?' I'm tryin' to hook you up, nigga. Look, Lenny, I am studying for the bar, okay? Tim, just talk to her, man! Just get dressed 'cause you're coming with me. [groaning] Yeah. Woo. Hmm. - Got a phone call for you. - Who is it, weenie boy? Well, it's a brother who would love to take you out. Oh, I'm really not for your mess tonight, Lenny. Woo, will you just talk to him, please? Tim, her name is Woo. Who? Hmm. - Hi, this is Woo. - Oh, hi. This is Tim. Uh, Lenny was sayin' that you might wanna hang out tonight. Are you asking me out on a date? Yeah, yeah, I-I'm askin' you. Why? Well, it might be your lucky night. - When's your birthday? - September 18th. Virgo, Virgo. Ooh, Virgo. Look, u.. I'll be there in an hour. - Tim, you are the man. - Very, very interesting. Thank you, thank you, brother. This is good lookin' out. Alright, look, man, I'mma give her your address, alright? - Um, peace. - Lenny.. [instrumental music] [knocking on door] Can I help you?

Hey, Tim, from across the hall. Pop that thing, baby. [imitates cork popping] (Darryl) 'Take off your clothes.' No, I prefer a self-actualized woman. I think the term, "Bitch" is first of all, overused, and is some condescending bullshit. You know, you about as fine as frog's hair. You know, my mother said the same thing. That's how fine you are. My sister said the same thing. Do I wanna fuck? Stop it. [doorbell buzzing] [heart pounding] [buzzing continues] [doorknob rattling] I'm Woo. You Tim?

Well, you'll never catch me doin' that. Well, that's good, it's all about havin' a little fun, right? Oh, yeah. You know, I enjoy having a nice laugh now and again. Life's too short, don't you think? I sure do. I see you got a little somethin' going on here too. I'm flattered. This is funny. This is funny. What's so funny? It just seems to me like a sister like you would have brothers lined up around the corner because-- "A sister like me?" W-what does that supposed to mean? I'm just saying that you got the tools to.. - I mean-- - I have the tools? You see, now, why can't a man and a woman just go out and have a good time? Does it always have to be about sex? Never mind. I should've known better than to expect anything more from one of Lenny's friends. Oh, yeah, what's this? Your little freak kit? That came in the mail. Shopping Network. I-I-- Stop it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Look, I didn't mean it, really. Really. Okay? Come on, I mean, some brothers can look at a beautiful woman and not lose their mind. I mean, I was tellin' the fellas just this afternoon "You do not always have to conduct yourself like dogs." - I told them that. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, as far as I'm concerned, you can be my sister. Really? I could be your sister? Yeah. Yeah, you can be my sister. Okay. Well, in that case you should open that bottle of champagne. That'll work. [chuckling] You are such a gentleman. I'm just trying to make you feel comfy. Whoo! Whoa. Here you go. Little bubbly. Thank you. [chuckling] Do you have a girlfriend? Excuse me? You know, I get so tired of playing all those games, don't you? I mean, it's like.. We never say what we really want. Now, be serious. What was your first thought when I walked in this house? [chuckling] I mean, you had some music playing softly. You had your lights down low. I mean, come on. See, that way.. ...we can stop wasting time. I mean, if this is all you want.. ...here it is. [chuckling] See, now, you don't really need to be drinking 'cause then you'll really start trippin'. Oh, Timmy. Timmy, Timmy, Timmy. Put my fire out. Say what? Put.. ...my.. ...fire.. ...out. - Gotcha! - What? [doorbell buzzing] (Woo) 'Better get that.' Oops! Don't forget the hat. Sister, huh? (Hop) 'You ain't watchin' that porno..'

You know how I hate to miss the beginning of the movie. Home alone, huh? Did you fuck her? Can you watch your mouth, please? Is that all y'all think about? Tim, you know that's too much woman for you, man. You gotta crawl before you walk, brah. (Hop) 'No, Tim, really, for real though, yo..' She a ho, ain't she? (Frankie) 'No doubt.' Oh, shit, Tim done paid for a ho to come up in here and do some wild shit! [laughing] She do parties? (Frankie) 'Eh, does she do bar mitzvahs?' (Hop) 'Does she do ho bar-mitzvahs?' - She's not a ho, okay? - Oh, shit. Tim, she either got to be gettin' paid or crazy to be up in here with your ass, fine as she is. - 'That's right.' - You know what? [Woo screaming] Oh, shit, that's her pimp, Hop. Wha-what? I'mma whoop his ass and take his money. (Frankie) 'Oh, no.' You use Red Velvet? Yeah. My cousin wore Red Velvet. It's a popular fragrance. My cousin was a construction worker, okay? And one day he walked underneath one of those things that drives the-the beams into the ground. - Oh, that's a pile driver. - 'Right. A pile driver.' They struck water trying to get him out of there. Sorry. [whimpering] Take it. (Hop) 'Hey, did you see that?' (Romaine) 'No, see, I gave him the ball' 'because I think a nice 90 mile an hour curveball' 'would cut all that stuff short.' Well, um.. I guess you.. ..probably need a minute to-- Yes, it's very true. I do need a minute. But I want you to get that outta here. - Get it! - I got it. Okay, so she's a little high strung. Hell, no! That ho crazy as a rope. Yeah, man, Woo in Japan must mean nutty bitch with seven years bad luck. Tim, salsa night, Washington Square Park. Yo, yo, yo, that's where we'll be when you finish with Cybil. Yeah, red hot Puerto Rican chicas. [singing in Spanish] Y'all just jealous, that's all. I really don't like being referred to as a "Ho." Look, I'm sorry. Now, I see why there are so many single women in New York. - They were just clownin'. - So was I. I mean, I hope you didn't take me seriously. Look, I'm nothin' like my boys. Come on, I mean, they're my boys and everything but, hey, I'm different. Can we start over? Why don't you just let me take you to dinner? Great. [instrumental music] Well, what are you doing? Changing. In my car? Well, stop the car and I'll change on the corner. [cycle bell ringing] Man, would you get outta here! Get outta here! Go! You are so grouchy. Sorry. Sweetheart, I'm gonna open up another bottle of the old Nightyard. Beautiful, baby. What you want, peach or watermelon? 'They taste the same.' Watermelon it is. Oh, shit. Babe, I got one more hot wing left. - Want it? - 'Got for it, baby.' Hey, babe, I'm thinkin' maybe, me and you should go to Shakim's party early. 'What do you think?'

My house stinks. And that stings! That stings me. Stallone, get it? But you never answered my question. Do you have a girlfriend? Well, as a matter of fact, not at the moment. A lawyer and you're not even spoken for? That's surprising. Well, let's just say I'm a little old-fashioned. - Who's this? - Where did you get that? - Hey, hey. - You just gonna steal somethi.. Give.. You just gonna take something outta my crib? Like 'em chunky, don't ya? [speaking in Italian] [laughing] Very funny. Do you think Mr. Don Corleone can give me some water next time, please?

I'll be inside, Woo. What is up with Bryant Gumbel? He is a little stuffy, isn't he? I'm trying to loosen him up a little bit. What am I doin' here? [instrumental music] Mmm. Hey, I brought you a piece. No, thank you. I don't wanna ruin my appetite. Alright, suit yourself. Mmm. 'Coconut mango.' Look, I'm sorry about Tookie, but she just with the, um.. - What? - Would you like a better view? She looked familiar, okay? Well, that's not surprising. Since they all do from the ass down, Timmy.

Uh, miss, please don't tamper with the fire extinguisher. How am I supposed to eat like this, huh? Why are we sitting at the funky table? As you can see, we're full. Oh, you're full tonight, so you sit the black people at the punt table. 'We didn't work hard enough in the fields' to deserve a decent table? (male #1) 'Senorina, please.' Sir, look, really there's no-- Hey, I am talking to Ricky Ricardo here. We might as well be in the storage room, okay? Look at all of this, huh? And what about this rope? - 'Ow!' - 'Oh, man!'

My conscience looks like Billy Dee? Think of me as the Billy Dee in you. Works for me. So, why aren't you going after her? For a subconscious, you got a mighty short memory. This isn't mahogany. I've got enough problems on my hands than to be worried about some crazy babe. Oh, why don't you spend a little time with the woman? Check her out. Find out what motivates her. It'll take some energy, but, it won't kill you. [scoffs] How do you know that? Well, my little brother if you really like her, you won't let her get away.
