(funky music) (muffled shouting) - Left. Your third left, bitch. No, no, no. Left. Right. No, not right. Your third left. Ah no, no, no, no. It's square. You're a good friend, baby. No, no. Look everything's gonna be square as a rhombus, as long as you bring Hambone some of those new sweet Frat Rags designs. That's right. Now, if Hambone happen to be in town enjoyin' the townspeople. Or if Hambone happen to be out on Hambone Lake enjoyin' Hambone's lake, then you need to be sure to just find that groundskeeper. He let you in you. He'll hook it up right sweet. That's right. Hambone hooked it up. He got you a full order full of all kinds of delicious goodies. You're gonna be hooked up all for the weekend. That's right, baby. We square. We square. That's right, baby. I'll see you soon. Hambone love you. And Hambone love your friends, too. (sighs loudly) Life is good for Hambone. Hambone got this sweet pad out here on Blood Fart Lake. Hambone got a boat. Hambone gonna enjoy life on his sweet dock that Hambone own. I don't think life ever been this good for Hambone. And I don't think life ever gonna be this good for Hambone. Hambone got the ladies. Hambone got the nine foot dick. That's right. (funky rap music) Woohoo. Life is good, people. Hambone gonna remove Hambone shoes. Hambone. That right. Hambone reasonably confident that Hambone gonna live forever. Shit.

(Snake groans) - Well guess what? You're pushing this thing the rest of the way to the cottage. - (groans loudly) No way! (laughing loudly) - You mook. Look at you doin' grunt work on vacation. What a spazz. - Yeah? Well you can help him. - [Zebes] No way. - What? I didn't fuck up. Oh this is bullshit. I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doin' here. (everyone talking) (dramatic springing) (all shouting) - That shit was funny back there. Didja- (girl cries out) D'ya think it was funny? Huh? - No. - Did I look like some cryin' Indian to you? - You don't look half the at all. - You can't throw garbage at people who are just walkin' by mindin' their own business. I'm Leo Dechampa. And I'll blast ass if anyone tries to step on my toes. How 'boutcha? - Sorry guy, but it was these three guys back here. You can do whatever you want to those three stooges. (all gasping) So what is all this? You on some wacky weekend sex adventure before your so-called schoolin' starts up again? One last hoorah before you go back and make somethin' of yourselves? - Well, sort of. Our friend owns a cottage up on Blood Fart Lake and he invited us up there to just hang out and chillax, you know? - Blood Fart Lake? Well, it's up the road just a little bit. Plus, that place is cursed. - Really? - Oh craps, a ghost! Girl, you got more makeup on than Ronald Mcdonald. You sure the dead wants to be seen with someone as ridiculous-lookin' as yourself? - I am the dead. I walk the earth breathing, yet not breathing. In between real and unreal. I am eternal. (inhales deeply) - Wicked ghoulish, right? That's why I always date gothic chicks. 'Cause they have low self-esteem to be taken advantage of my super powerful popularness. (laughs) Yeah, yo way, yo. - I got three dead family members locked in my shanty at home, kids. Takes a lot to scare old Leo. They speak to me. - Well listen, Leo, we're sorry about throwing that garbage at you back in the road but we need to get some gas and get to the cottage before nightfall. - Considering you're all just a bunch of piss ants enjoying one last party weekend before your schoolin' starts, I'm gonna let that one slide. And you know what? Good old Leo's gonna do you one better. I'm gonna fill up your gas tank for ya. For free. Blood Fart Lake's still a good half day drive up that road. - Really Mr. Dechamp? That would be awesome. Is there anything else we can do for you? - Oh I told you not to worry about it. 'Sides you kids are gonna have your hands full up at Blood Fart Lake. You know, it's cursed and all. - You didn't exactly tell us why it's cursed, soldier boy. Spill it toot sweet before you take a powder. - The whole fuckin' place is cursed, to tell you the truth. It all happened about 20 years ago over at the Van Brunt farm. You see, there was a little boy. His name was Jimmy. He was a retard. He liked to play in the cornfield at night. Well one day these punks, well they hated Jimmy. They don't like retards up here. I hate 'em. Well, anyway, they set fire to the cornfield. It burned the whole bitch down. It came down like acid rain. Poor old Jimmy ran right up the scarecrow. Burned alive to a big old crispin' (giggles) Anyways, the town say the scarecrow still walks these lands. Some say they see him by the lake. Many have turned up missin'. Oh. Ghoulish. - Can I just say that that story alone gave me, like, five orgasms? I am so wet right now. We have to get to that cottage, Ben. Like, now. - (sighing) All filled up. Now that's just legend. Legends ain't real. Right, kids? Farts. Yeah. Now get the hell out of my sight. Go get stoned or pwned or boned or whatever it is you kids do these days. So glad I'm sterile. - (all) Thanks, Leo. - Thank you, sir.

Enter me. - I can make a great film here. Mmm. - What the hell is this? - What what what? (whines) - Who the hell are you? - Well who the hell are you dudes comin' in here actin' like you're gonna party and make with the merriment? - But Hambone said- - But but but Hambone says. Does it look like I give a rat's pocket comb what Hambone says? I'm the weekend cleanser of this place. And I could get into serious trouble if you husky nailed whales frigg with this joint. Now get this party out of my domicile. Scoot. - Dude. Fuckin' a. - I'm just joshin' you. (giggles) Get those tight little groins back here. - What? (Caspian giggling) - Yeah. Just pulling your butts. Shitting in your cereal. You know. - So you are expecting us? - Oh sure. Hambone set it all up for you. I'm just the keeper while he's away. I could use the company. As long as you don't mind me stickin' around your persons for a little post-high school debauchery and sextacy? You kids can totally rock this joint for the weekend. - Ah. So you were acting like you were going to throw us out, eh? Huh. Well done, trickster. I could feel the emotions. What's your name squirelly dude-os? - Ah. Allow me to introduce myself. I am (foreboding music) Caspian. (drum crash) And welcome to my nightmare. (high pitched laughing) Oh, fuck, I do have fun don't I, kids? - So you know Hambone then? - Know him? I taught him everything he knows. - Do you know the Dark Arts and listen to Evanescence? (Sally hissing) - Evanescence? Are you kidding me? There is only one dark fantasy-inspired female front metal band. And that is Nightwish. How smooth is that, sister? - Nightwish? - Hey. I think you just found your new fuck friend, eh Meredith? - It's Sally, Zebes. Remember? Sally. - Sally, Suzie. Meredith. Whatever. Fuckin' loopy gash. - Well, let me give you swingers a tour. - You can choose where you want to sleep and make the party room. I'm so glad you hombres are here. - What the fuck are those? (dramatic music) (thighs throbbing) - Oh. You mean my Popeye calves. I like to think of them as Heaven's soldiers. He left me as big as a gumdrop in the scrotal pouch department, but gave me these fuckin' sexual predators right here. You have no idea how much cum I have packed in these bad mammo jamos. - Are you angry? Are they gonna turn green or some shit? 'Cause you's a goddamn mutant. Looks like somebody put a couple of breast implants- - So, gang, you wanna get settled in? - Uh, Caspian you want to show us what's up inside? - Super fresh. Lead the way, gang. And after you're all packed in, we'll have a little powwow together so we can get to know each other. - Yeah. - Sound like a plan? Come here. Is the big girls yours, my man? - Yeah. Meredith- I mean, uh, Sally. Little fuckin'- yeah I guess that thing's mine. Why? - Right on, gringo. She's a cybertronian violation of having excessive bootay. - Yeah. - Make a dead man weep. Make a hobo fuck a trash can, eh? - (laughing) Yeah, you know it, Creepy. You know it. - Gimme some. Oh, bop it. - Fuckin' weird. - [Leo] Shit! Fuckin' technology. (tools clanging) Robots drivin' cars. Robots, that's what they are. They're all robots. This is why I don't work on cars 'cause they don't work. I hate 'em. Too many fuckin' problems. (dramatic music) Problems. Besides, you've given me more problems. (footsteps approaching) Shit. Listen, guy, we gotta talk. Ya ain't workin' for me. (defeated sobbing) (boinging) Holy blowjob. - Hey, scumbag. You wouldn't happen to know where the bus stop is around here, would ya? (Leo growls) - (coughing) Mm, you talkin' to me? - Of course, you dirty shit. I gotta get to Canandaigua, New York as soon as I can. - Well shit, girl. The next bus to Canadaigua ain't 'til seven o'clock tonight. - (sighing) For serious? Shit. What're we gonna do now, turd face? (Leo grunts) - By God, woman. You got me workin' up the blackest sweat. You flirtin' with me? - Duh. Of course I'm flirting with you. I, uh, find you pretty repugnant, actually. - Well if repugnant means what I think it means, you must think I'm fuckin' Brad Pitt or somethin'. Well you know what, little lady, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna take you to Canadaigua myself. - Oh my God, you would do that for me? - Well, Miss Purdy Pussycat, if you keep sweet talkin' me the way you doin' right now- and you do do it good- Well then, I would eat shit and poop out diamonds with brownie mixture all over it all over your midriff. Just for you. - God, I would so be in your debt if you can do this for me... Greasy, filthy, transient. What's your name? - It's Leo. Leo Dechampa. - Well Leo Dechampa, take me with you. - Well step into my chariot, princess. (Leo chuckling) I haven't strangled me a whore in a coon's age. (Leo laughing maliciously) (loud rock music) (car doors slamming) (tires screeching) (fingers snapping) - So. (fingers snapping) Yay, gang. Now that we have all the rooms shanked out, why don't we get to know each other a little bit better? Do a little roll call. Go around the room, say a little somethin' about yourselves, eh? (scoffing) - Lame. - Well why don't you go first then, Mr. Grinch Grouch? Get it out of the way. - Bah. Name's Zebes and I'm from New Jersey. Home of the boss. - Ah, home of the boss. I love Dancing In The Dark. Makes me feel all, woo, squishy. - Wha-? Later for you, man. There's only one boss from the five boroughs and it ain't Springsteen. Tony freakin' Danza's the boss, my friends, and none of you forget about it. Shit. Yeah. - Danza? I was more partial to Mona. That walking skeletoon had a pair of moundly hoots that would make even the youngest child pop a boner. One bag of bones I wouldn't mind bossin', eh fellas? (giggling) (clock ticking) (upbeat music) - Well, you sort of know me. I'm Ben. Lifelong horror fan. I also own my own t-shirt company, Fright Rags. - Ooh. Horror films, eh? Not a big fan of spooks and gore, myself. But a mellow scare, now and then, is good for the heart, I think. Something like "Stepmonster". Now there's a good movie. Gets my juices flowin'. One for the fright books, eh, my man? - Um, yeah. Classic. - Caspian. - Meredith, is it? - It's Sally. I legally changed my name to give homage to my fave character from Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas". I believe that mellow evil is the one and true human emotion. It's pure and untapped. After reading Glenn Danzig's book, "Shecky The Horror Punk Warrior Inside Your Black Heart"- - (all) Whoa. - [Sally] I truly found death in life. Finding that morbid angel within my soul has made me a stronger, more stable person. I hardly even cut my labia anymore. When I break wind, each fart is a message to Robert Smith's brainwaves telling him that his minions care more than he knows. - You think you're dark? I poop from my dick tip. And you, Mr. Vagabond-No-Way-Man. Who might you be? - I'm Snake. Fuckin' a. - And? - Uh. All right. - A real scholar in our midst, I see. - Forget about these chuckleheads. Take a whiff off of my brilliant frame. - Oh. I like you. - Oh and you better remember this face, by golly, for I am... Gwendolyn Bouvier. Screen star. - Oh, so you wanna be in movies? - Wanna be? That's for wannabees, kid. I am in pictures. Why, have you ever seen a little film called "Swamp Sex Robots"? - No. - Eh? It was huge in Canada, I tell you, huge. Why it was bigger than "Freddy Got Fingered" over there. - No. - Loopy as fucks, I tells ya. - As far as I'm concerned the only good thing out of Canada is Toblerone. - Bah. You lowbrows wouldn't know it, I suppose. It was an art house gem directed by my mother. Hmm. Interesting story about that day. My mother raised me in a commune with other actors. Sexed her way to the top. Why, I could tell you stories about three ways twixt her JFK and James Earl Jones. - Those maniacs are going to be on my to-do list, my lady. - Oh ha chachachacha. (both singing out of key) - Whoa. Boobs. (sexy music) - Caspian. Who is that? - Oh. You mean slutty mctrampwhore? That's Ashley Sawyer. She's the girl next door. - Has she always been here? (breathing heavily) Why didn't Hambone tell me about her? Maybe Hambone's gay, did you ever think of that? I mean, she's all right. Not exactly fuck-able by any stretch of the multiverse. She's kinds creepy, if you know what I mean. - I've just gotta meet her. (sniffing deeply) - Oh, Ben. Yet another skirt for me to push my violatin' self onto. This might be a pretty well worth weekend, after all. Know what I'm sayin'? (slapping counter) - Hey, Zebes. (Zebes groans) - I'm the only tramp you're gonna be making moist this weekend. Remember. I own your soul. We're blood mates until Peter Steele calls us home. - Yeah you own my soul, blood mates, uh. So, anyone like dark in ya? (slaps counter) Hey. Yo, back for the attack, yo. (water splashing) (foreboding music) - Can I help you? - Water must be cold, uh? - And why is that? - Oh, um, 'cause your nipples they look like they're, uh, about ready to attack. (apple crunches) - Wow. I just met you and you're already cracking titty jokes. Not a good first impression. - Yeah that was, uh, kind of lame. - My friend, Hambone, invited us up here to the cottage for the weekend. You know. I'm Ben. - Ashley. - I know. Caspian told us. Ashley Sawyer. Beautiful. Bone throbbing. Sexy. - Up here, skeazix. (belching) - Yeah. Sorry about that. So do you live up here at the lake or- ? - No, I'm just here for the summer. Cottage sitting for a friend. Um so, Caspian told you all about me? - Yeah. - Well, that's odd because I haven't had the chance to introduce myself to him yet. - Well, he is a little creepy. - Ya think? - Well, listen, I think we got off on, like, the wrong flipper um... So you know, we're gonna be having an explosive bacchanalia later, if you care to join us. You're not busy or anything. - Maybe, but I'm not quite sure if you can handle how cool I am. - (mumbling) That's a bold statement, 'cause I think I'm pretty cool, you know. - Well maybe I'll stop by then, cool Ben. (loud farting) - [Ben] Are you okay? - Oh yeah, yeah. I just, I shit my swimsuit. So, later. - What a woman. - So my fine Nubian princess. I may call you Nubian, right? - Do I look Nubian to you? - Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know what Nubian means, per se. So Miss pretty, sweet somethin' or other. Why are you going to Canadaigua, anyway? You got some sweet man to come home to? Give him a big blow job? - Actually, I need to get to Blood Fart Lake. Are you familiar with that? - What did you just say? - Are you familiar with- - No! Right before that. - Blood Fart Lake. - That's what I thought my brain thought you said, bitch. (tires crunching) (horn beeps) - What the hell are you doing, Leo? - I can't let you go to that place, miss lady girl. It's doomed. - What? - It's got a death curse on it. You don't understand. I once heard that the reason Def Leppard's drummer's only got one arm is 'cause of that place. Although, sometimes, I doubt the validity of that tale. - Well look, I'm headed for an early grave then 'cause Blood Fart Lake is where I'm goin'. Now turn this car on and kick out the motherfuckin' jams. - What? Didn't you just hear me proclaim my frightened rant? I said no. - Turn on the motherfuckin' car and hit the motherfuckin' pedal to the metal. - I'm sorry but I shain't go no further. - Okay then, Leo. (slapping) (Leo shouting) - Miss Ambrosia. Oh, I fell on my Weird Al tape. Goddammit. - See you later, pussy face. Thanks for the ride. Oh, and here's a pearl of wisdom to take with you on your personal journey. (farts loudly) - Harsh. (car door slams) - Sorry, dude. I don't need no wet vag foggin' up my personal destiny. (engine starting) - But, Thunder. What is your destiny? - Revenge. You shall live and be well. (car peeling out) - Revenge? Oh, what the hell does that even mean? Oh, damn it. Leo, you really are a pussy face. How could you let her go like that? (sighs heavily) Oh, shit on a shingle. I can't let her get all doomed up like that. I'm comin', girl. And I'm bringing Smith. (smacks) And Winston. (smacks) As back up. (grunting shouts) (funky rock music) - This music brings my twice-blackened heart back to a deep, vibrant red. - A skylight. A whirlpool. A half a pound of butter. My God, I'm in heaven. ♪ What's goin' on ♪ ♪ A new girl ♪ ♪ What's goin' on ♪ - Man, now that's an extreme tune right there. Sometimes I think about Kip Winger covering that tune and I actually cry. I'm being dead ass serious here. I openly cry thinking about Winger and Nuke 'em High. - The class of Nuke 'em High would have been way better if there had been some sort of suicide trio of women. Who vowed to have sex with Satan, once they re-entered the gates of Hell. - Say, wasn't Johnny Depp in that? - No, it was Ron Jeremy, right? - No. Ron Jeremy was in part three, but his scene was cut. - I could have swore that was Johnny Depp. - Maybe you're thinking of Richard Grieco. - Who the fuck is Richard Grieco? - He's the poor man's Johnny Depp. - I thought Skeet Ulrich was the poor man's Johnny Depp. - Fuck no. Skeet Ulrich is the poor man's Henry Winkler. - Then who's the poor man's Skeet Ulrich? - Billy Garberina. - No Billy Garberina's the poor man's Jim Carrey. Hey! (drum beat) - Come on in, Ben-o, the water's wonderful. (upbeat music) - Well all right! Woo! (Gwen shrieks) (water splashing) - So, Ben, honey. When are you gonna quit the t-shirt biz and start making your own motion pictures? - Well, I want to, Gwen, I just haven't had the artistic push I've been looking for. Well, like I got this movie I've been workin' on in my head called Brutal Postman. It's about a guy who blames all his problems in life on the size of his small genitalia. So, in order to compensate for his nether region misfortune, he slaughters every ex-girlfriend he's ever had that has lied to him about the size of his meat. - Why, that sounds like a gold picture to me. It could make- Oh, at least, one million smackaroos in the international box office. Why, it could be bigger than Leonard Part 6. - Have you even seen parts one through five? - Have I seen them? My mother directed those pictures but said they were far too cinematic for the cinema. She took them down to the Cosby studio for the Cosby show, put them in the middle of the Huxtable's living room floor, squatted over them and heaped period discharge all over those pictures, ruining them for all time. - What? Bullshit. - Hand to God, I tells ya. I was there on the next sound stage. I was filming a pilot for a show called "Uh Oh Oreo". About two black men that adopt a streetwise orphan girl. A little white girl, you see. Who brings unity into their hearts with her quirky, yet lovable fashion sense and colorful language. - Wha-? - Mmm. Starring Sydney Poitier and LeVar Burton. Huh. Guess who was the streetwise orphan? - You? - You're a bright one, Ben-o. T'was me. But forget everything I just said and watch me act my way out of this paper bag. (bag crinkles) - Hi, Ben. (footsteps thudding) - Ashley what are you doing here? - Oh, water must be cold, huh? - Why do you say that? - Because your dick is as small as Billy Garberina's. Oh. - Yeah, I deserve that. Well, hey, listen this is my friend Gwen. - Aren't you Gwen Bouvier from "Swamp Sex Robots"? - Ah! A fan, I see. Ha. Why yes, lovely. 'Tis I, the one and only. Well, it's always lovely to meet a beautiful young fan as yourself but I gotta go. I gotta have my date with the octopus and tappity dance underwater. Woo! (water splashing) (muffled speaking) (speaking gibberish) (door shutting) - Hey, new girl. I think your tits are ready for me. You like Bon Jovi? (laughs) - Ashley, this is Zebes. - I don't know about you but I'm feelin' a real deep connection between your girly parts and my manly parts. - And I'm Sally. His girlfriend. - So, is this an act or is he always like this? - Sweetheart, isn't he? He's my dark knight and I'm his fallen angel. I know he comes on strong but believe me, "girl next door", you couldn't handle his passion. - I'm pretty sure I couldn't handle him. - All right. - This is Snake. - Why do they call you Snake? - Fuck you. - And this is our host, Caspian. He's Hambone's friend and handyman. - Hi, Caspian. Um, so I got in a few nights ago, but I didn't wanna bother you 'cause you were doin' a lot of work and everything. Um, apparently you already know me? - Yes, Ashley Sawyer. I make it a point to know all the residents around my boss's summer surroundings. Would hate to have no-goodniks upset his tranquility when he gets here. Wouldn't we? - One does hate to upset tranquility. - Yeah, so is it cool if she stays for the eats and the tomfoolery, the night? - Of course, any friend of yours Ben is... A friend of yours. Gwen, honey child, grub's on. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (drum crash) - Yay, gang. I just wanna thank you all for letting me be a part of your good times. - (all together) Aw. - Thank you, Caspian. Why, you could have just kicked us out on our keisters. Buying us a one-way ticket back to ugly town. - Yeah. Thank you, Caspian. You're really cool and it means a lot on a deep, emotional level. And I'm not talking figuratively. I'm talking literally here. Deep pools of emotion right here. - Yes. Thanks, Sally, but it was no problem. Hambone set it all in motion. I was just here to execute him. It- It just gets really lonely here, guys. You feel me, dogs? - Fuckin' a. - So here's what I'm going to do. I just so happen to have a movie projector upstairs that I watch my porno snuff films on from time to time. And, over the years, I have been lucky enough to collect the world's largest 35 millimeter collection of the Ernest P. Worrel films. So, ho ho. - You're not sayin' what I think you're sayin', are you? - Yup. Ernest marathon, anyone? (all cheering) "Ernest Goes To Camp", "Ernest Saves Christmas", "Ernest Scared Stupid", "Ernest Goes To Jail", and my favorite "Ernest T-bags Vern". (Gwen clapping) - Ah, bravo! - [Zebes] I like that one, personally. Yeah, I do. I do. - So, eat up. I gotta go drop some bowel fungus off in the turlet. I'll be back in two shakes of a dead horse dingleberry, y'all. - Oh. Wait. On second scratch. How about Ernest on tomorrow night? (all protesting) - No, no, no, no, no. Tonight, we tell ghost stories. (chuckling) (everyone chattering) - All right. - I know (indistinct) Oh me too. Yo, that creepy dude. He's all right in my book. (laughing loudly) Hey. You know, this chip is pretty salty. Like my dick. (explosive laughter) (everyone carrying on) - [Disembodied Voice] Van Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. - No, no no no. Wait. No, no, wait. It gets even scarier, right? So, this mook comes up to me and asks me for a remote control. You know, one of those ones that control the universe. So, I was like, "Yeah, I'll give you a remote control for five bucks." So I'm thinkin'- - [Gwen] Five dollars? - He's gonna says, "No." Right? Right. But he says, "Yes." So five bucks richer. I give him a remote I stole from my mother's house. And to make a long dick short. There aren't even any batteries in. So fuckin' sweet. All right. I know. What a dick, right? Pretty scary, right? Well, I guess it was more funny than scary. But, uh, any you guys like the band Cinderella? - So Caspian, do you know anything about this Jimmy Van Brunt crap? - That's the retarded scarecrow killer, right? That around here? - [Zebes] Scarecrow? - Oh now you've done it, friends. I know all about the legend of poor old Jimmy Van Brunt. - [Gwen] Wha-? Ah, that wacky redneckian garbage peddler told us a bit about it back on the stretch. Said this place is cursed. I say it'd make a great motion picture. - I believe it is cursed, Gwen. Cursed with the foul stench of burning flesh and straw. Now, I don't know what some crazy redneck told you but this is how it all went down. You see young Jimmy wasn't a very bright boy. He would often spend his days playing in his father's cornfield. He was searching for a wormhole that would teleport him to another dimension, where he could live as a combination of Jason Priestley, Triple H and David Copperfield. - Did he find the wormhole and live his dream? - Um. He wasn't very bright. The local cool kids were always picking on young Jimmy for living in another world. One day, he was out in the field searching for the portal to the other dimensions. Well, those punks entered the fields and started lighting fire crackies to scare the bejesus out of young Jimmy. - Savages. - Ha. Sounds like a freakin' blast. - Sounds like a fuckin' a. - It does. - One of the giant-sized bottle rockets exploded into flames, lighting the field on fire. Young Jimmy, not being so bright, shimmied up a scarecrow pole and hid in the suit, thinking it would protect him from the danger. Little did he know, that it sealed his fate forever. For once inside, the flames engulfed the straw and sent him into a spazzing fit of burning anguish. - [Gwen] Ah. - Shivvies, huh? Well those fucking punk kids just ran away. Leaving poor roasting Jimmy for dead. Fuckers. - So, what happened? - Well, some people say that young Jimmy died that night. And soon after his old daddy died of- Ouch. Heartache. But others say that Jimmy survived the fire and killed his father for being a lazy drunk on the couch and not coming to his rescue. And from there on, went a killing spree of all the punks who taunted and scarred him for life. But, still, around the town people talk about how they see the scarecrow walking the lake at night. In the place that holds his soul forever. And ever. And ever. - Well, what do you believe, Caspian? - Well, I believe it's a big load of bull sperm, if you want my opinion. But it makes for one hell of a story, don't you agree? - Riveting, I tells ya, it was riveting. (snapping fingers) I'm gonna call my agent right now. See if we can't make this a gold picture. Beep, boop, beep. Hello, Mommy? This is superstar number one. I need a movie made pronto. Yeah, listen. It's a slasher flick starring me, Adrienne Barbeau, and Lou Ferrigno as the killer. We'll call it, "Death, Thy Name Is Scarecrow." Yeah. A real art house gem. (yawning loudly) - Well gang I'm pippity pooped. Gotta go jack off and hit the sack. (everyone groaning) Oh you kids flatter me you, really do, but I gotta gets my booty sleep. Tomorrow's another day. But enjoy the night and don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Like what? - It's just an expression, Zebes. - No. Fuck that. I want answers. What wouldn't you do? - Okay. I guess I wouldn't poop in my hands and use it to masturbate with. So don't do that. - Eh. Cripes, man, I wouldn't do that. - Well then, there you go. Anyway, gang. Tata. (screaming shrilly) - So, did you have a good time tonight, Ashley? - (scoffing) No. Not really. - Hey wait. Don't you wanna stick around and watch "The Burning" or "Thrashin'" or somethin'? - Uh, you know, we'll watch "The Burning" next year, okay? But, tomorrow. "Thrashin'"? - Okay. - Okay. Night, guys. - Hey, uh, dude, Ben man, I'm gonna go chill on the hammock and listen to my Bill and Ted's tape. If you wanna, like, sleep with me, you know, it's cool. I, too, know how hard it is not to be gettin' laid. - Are you asking me to fuck you? - Fuck me? Fuck you. (snoring) - Hey, Gwen, do you wanna hang out and watch some horror movies with me? (whining note) Why do I hang out with these people? Ugh. (paranormal music) - Fuckin' a. Yeah, fuckin a' Fuckin' Panzer. Kick your ass. All right. - [Disembodied Voice] Van Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. - What? Who shanked my tunages, man? Zebes, if this is you, man, I'm totally gonna sweat all over you tomorrow. It's not cool to jack man's tunes. Fuckin' a. No. (dramatic music) - Van Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. - What? Dude. You're wearin' my phones, man. Not all right. - Oh. Sorry I can't hear ya. I'm jammin' out to some Diamond Dave's solo stuff. You should check this shit out, man. It's awesome. Yeah. - Dude. You sound fuckin' gay, man. Fuckin' a! - Uh oh. The tape's all done. Well, fiddlesticks. I guess there's only one thing left to do. - Uh, what's that? - Thanks for the rock, my man. Stay gold, Ponyboy. - Oh cranberries! There is something I forgot to do. - What? - This. (heavy drum music) - (screaming) No! (maniacal laughing) (slices fingers) - Oh my God. My digits! Fuckin' lame. Oh my God. Look at the blood. - Time for or d'oeuvres. I prefer finger foods. (crunching) - (spitting) I don't think I like the taste of my fingers, man. - No? Well don't be such a fussy eater. How about a side order of this? (squishing) (Snake screaming) - I don't like corn in my eye. (maniacal laughing) - It's nice to know it fits. (laughing) - Fuckin a. (music fades) - And the world is shy another douche bag. One, two, three into the four. Jimmy Van Brunt hack slashin' at your door. (farting loudly) Corn really is in everything these days. (echoing, maniacal laughter) (soft piano music) (leaves rustling) - I hate you. (sobbing) I hate you. Stretch marks. Stretch marks. Footprints tear on my skin. Oh, God. (knocking on door) Come in. Come in. - Caspian? I- - Pretty brave entering my dominion, aren't you milady? Approach me. (soft piano music) (door creaking) - I... I just wanted to... - You're intrigued, aren't you? You want to taste true passion. - I do. I feel you within me. I wanna see what you see. - I doubt your simpleton mind could handle the sights I see. - But, if you're willing to learn. (chuckles knowingly) - Oh, teach me, Caspian. (Caspian moans) I wanna fuck like the big dipper fucks the galaxy. - (moaning) I sense that about you. I could smell the fuck side dwelling within you. I presume your hole wants to be taught as well? - Mine hole? - Yes. Your trench. If you want to learn how to truly fuck like I, you must be consumed with fuck. Mind, soul and cunt. - But I don't have any money to to pay for this pizza. You want me to give myself to you wholeheartedly and with no remorse? - I can show you pleasures of the likes which you've never dreamed. - Have you ever fucked pure, uncut sex before, Ashley? I mean pure, uncut sex. - No. - Being fucked by sex is like Fleetwood Mac ejaculating all over your insides. Why, it's like being injected with the world's strongest space heroin and living through it. In fact my desolate Jezebel, I inject pure uncut Irish heroin into my penile shroom for maximum pleasure. And you will feel the sex in you when I'm done. Oh yes. - I don't know. The good in me still struggles with that sweet image of Ben. Oh he's such a- - Loser. My plum 'tis engorged with the sweet hot porridge of my forefathers and you dare fucking refuse it? All you have to do is grab onto my tits and hold on. (Caspian moans loudly) ♪ Cream cheese is made of me ♪ ♪ Two parts, cream ♪ ♪ Three parts, me ♪ - Caspian. - Yes? - Fuck me away from all this death. - Wait 'til you see what I do next. (screaming) (droning music) - Ashley. (breathing heavily) (Gwen singing) - Hey, yo. How come you never do that for me? - Coffee kids. - Oh, delicious. I'll have two. - Yeah. Good call. (apples thudding) - Whoa. (Zebe laughing) - Ah, there you are, you whimsically-hung, lady killer. (claps hands) Breakfast is served. - You okay, Ben? Heard you screamin' in there. Bad dreamies? - Yeah. Somethin' like that. - Hey, Ben, I bet it was a sexual conquest with that Ashley broad, am I right? I was dreamin' of her too, ya know. (slapping) - Hey, asshole. - No, girl, it was a three-way. Yeah, you were in it too. You know you're my second best girl. Come on. - Well, in that case. Anyway, I had this dream where you were rubbing Toblerone all over my asshole and then at the last minute Tim Burton pops out of it and steals the chocolate from your hands. And then scurries into my anal cavity. It was so morbidly awesome. Oh yeah. And then out of nowhere, my pussy started puking and Danny Elfman music began to play. It was Beetlejuice, I think. I love that dream, come to think of it. - Fuckin' gross ass twat. I still love you, though. - You wanna take a spooky walk down some mysterious trail? - Fuckin' listen to some Pat Benatar. I might even hold your hand, girl. Isn't he a dark prince? - Let's do this. (Gwen singing) (clearing throat loudly) - So, uh, any of you guys seen Snake yet this morning? - I haven't seen balls nor ass of him. - Well, you know Snake. He probably got bored and hitched a ride back to town to play with his panzer. - Panzer? Is that a slang word for dick? (giggles) - No, honey, it's a tank. He likes to ride it around his backyard screaming, "Fuckin' a!" And, "ALL right!" He's a weird bird, that Snake. But not as weird as the night that I spent on a boat with screen legend Mickey Rooney. - Oh no. - The guy used to rub his nuts all over new starlets in the biz. Had elephantitus, you know. How he hid 'em for screen roles is beyond me. But kid, never let Mickey Rooney rub you with his nuts. ♪ Raping kids all day long. ♪ - Oh, Gwen. (laughing loudly) What the hell is this? It looks like some kind of wild Indian. - That wild Indian picture happens to be stylin'. You don't know what you're talking about. - Okay. So, I think I'm gonna go find Ashley, so she can help me work on some new t-shirt designs. What's on your agenda for the day? - Nothing. (smacking counter) - Oo! Damn them enchiladas. (mysterious music) (car door slams) (bugs chirping) - 'Cause I saw that sign and it opened up thine eyes, I saw that sign. Life's demandin'. Without fuckin' understandin'. (coughing) Where the fuck am I? Christ. Think Leo's lost. - Don't move, sucker. - Industrial stapler. - Leo, what the fuck? - God damn, girl, you almost ended my sensuous life. What the hell you doin' out here? - Fuck you. What are you doing out here? - Trick, I just couldn't let you come out here alone. I already had to warn some punk ass kids about this place and who knows what evil befell them? Now, I wasn't about to let some pussy go get cursed. Uh-uh. Not on my watch. - Kids? You let kids come out here? - Well, I wasn't about ready to stop them. I mean they just wanted to have one last fuck weekend before the school started again. - Shit. I may already be too late. Fuck. - Girl, what the hell you goin' on about there? - You stupid, little turd hat. - Those kids could sit off a chain reaction that could bring their pathetic lives to a brutal and bloody end. - So they are in danger? But from what exactly? The curse? Jimmy Van Brunt? Dragons? Goddammit, woman, tell me. - A demon. (sputtering) - Demons? Demons ain't real, bitch. But there was that sweet Lombardo bible flick that came out in the early 80s. Amazing special effects. (whipping) - Take your clothes off. - Excuse me? - Don't think I haven't been noticing you raping me with your eyes. In this time of great fear and powerful revenge-filled adrenaline, it is time for the warriors to step up to the plate and lay out some God damned pipe. Are you a warrior, Leo? Can you plow my pussy for me to fully recharge my body and get me ready for battle? - Bitch. I'm the greatest warrior that ever lived. Feel. My. Power. (angelic voices singing) - This is my only chance to save those kids, asshole. So tear my shit proper. - Got my stash all comin', girl. You ever do gymnastics? - Well I do fuck-nastics. I'm all nimble and wily inside you. I'm like a mongoose looking for nutrients. I get inside your vag and I find that sweet spot. And sting ya with my dick poison. Oh yeah. - Skeet skeet. Looks like rain. (Leo moans) - Cling tenaciously to my buttocks. - Oh yeah, girl. Oh, you're lickin' made my 'stache- Now, get up. You wanna fuck with me? (Thunder moaning) Oh I'm gonna fuck you, ya whore. Ya whore. Oh. (Leo moans) (Zebes singing badly) (imitating guitar) - You know what this trail needs? Is some sweet Halloween decorations. You know, really spooky it up a bit. Make it look like one of those haunted Halloween attractions. - Are you, uh, talkin', Sally? 'Cause to be perfectly honest, I was thinkin' about doin' you again. - You are such a horn dog, Zebes. - I know - You wanna do me here? - Right here? Are you serious? - Yeah. Let's be kinky. - Oh shit. My balls just churned a little and I got that chill up my spine I get when my dick tip starts a-tinglin'. Sally, you're the best. - You got a rubber? - Rubber? Fuck, no. Let's live life on the dark side. Isn't that what you're all about? - No rubber, no sex. And I don't think poppin' out a Zebes spawn is dark. - What? - Maybe a nightmare, but not dark. - Bitch. - Get a rubber. - You don't know. Um. Can't I just, uh, maybe kill a squirrel and use that as a rubber? - Oh wait. Better yet, how 'bout we frottage? You got a pretty big cunt nub, we can rub our tips together and make some frottage cheese, you know. (chuckling gibberish) - Ew, Zebes. Just get a fuckin' rubber. I'll wait here. Get myself all moist for ya. - All right. Don't start without me, ha. I wanted to frottage, though. (Sally moaning) - A little somethin' to tide me over until he gets back. (lips smacking) (lustful growling) (suspenseful music) (sticks crackling) (Zebe's singing) - Hey. Looks like Snake lost his newly acquired cassette. Finders keepers. Losers suck. (dramatic crash) (gravel scraping) Oh, let me see. Oh Bill and Ted, I love those guys. Coulda had me that cassette- Ah! (squishing) Oh, dude, what the? Ow, my dick is huge. - Gives a new meaning to corn holing, eh? Your digestive tract is amazing. (blubbering) - Jimmy Van Brunt, you stuck me in my asshole. What are you doin', eh? Yo. - Oh my. Your crotch looks like a thick marinara just waiting to be soaked up by a hot Italian pasta. Mmm yummy. - Marinara? That sounds kinda good right about now. - Later for you. You're about to swim with the fishes. - Get- Wait. Van Brunt. There's one thing I gotta know. You like Bon Jovi? - Bon Jovi blows. - Wha-? No. (sobbing loudly) - Now, what about that Goth Topic reject? (Sally laughing) - Oh, burn victims. About time you got back. I'm almost all dry here, so you better pile in. Zebes? (loud gasping) - Zebes? Why, he had a little bit too much of bad medicine. And, as for you, it's time to change trends there, Vampirella. - What? - I mean, really, the big girl goth thing is so passe. The skin and waif bones thing is the way to hit the scene now, girlfriend. Woohoo. - Really? (gravel crunching) I- I was getting bored of this trend, anyway. - Well, you're in luck scenester. Voila. Who ordered the cottage cheese? Suckah, suckah, suckah, suckah, suckah. (vacuum whirring) - No. No. No. (squishing) (Sally screaming) - This job really sucks. (laughing manically) (Sally moaning) (hose slurping) - It's important to baste for about five seconds per pound. Are you ready for a little reverse bulimia? - I'm not even hungry. (sobbing hysterically) (hose slurping) (choking) (spitting) - I loved you. - Oh, I guess she couldn't stomach the thin look. Shoulda tried South Beach. (machine ding) (maniacal laughter) (Leo screaming) - Pancakes on your face. - Do it, Daddy. - [Leo] Oh God. - You greasy hog fucker. Drench me in your- (Leo screaming) (Thunder moaning) - Oh, shit. Now that was battle fuckin'. (Leo moans) - It was good but I reject the taste of your syrup. - [Leo] What? - A warrior woman must be purified with only the finest nut butter before battle. And yours, my intellectually challenged friend, is subpar. - Wait one cotton pickin' minute here. You sayin' my Jesus juice ain't finger lickin' good, bitch? Me? Leo Dechampa. - Well. That is what I'm sayin', Leo Dechampa. You got a big dick like a brotha, but drinking your brew is like Schweppes when I should be drinking Canada Dry. - You're cold-blooded. You got a phone? I gotta call my uncle and tell him about your bullshit. (cork popping) Thank you. Wait a minute. Who is this? - (sighing) It's my brother. - What? Your brother? Now, I didn't see him in that group of kids. Is he in danger too? - He's in a world of danger, Leo. A whole shit pile of danger. (Leo sputtering) (cartoonish singing) - What's a matter, Ben-o? Your pretty peach ain't here? - No. I hope she didn't go home for good. I was really diggin' that girl. And no burning or thrashing. - Mm. Ah, young love. I remember when I was in love. Must have been during The Great Depression because all I remember eatin' was semen from an NYC hobo on the corner of Broadway and Nowheresville. - Gwen, you know you're only 24, right? - 24 in dog years, scooter. 24 in dog years. (bell rings) - Well, I'm working on a new line of t-shirts with the face of racist horror-themed comedian, Henry Couteau, with one of his jokes underneath that says "Dracula was a fag and them's the facts." - Hmm. Funny story about that Henry Couteau. He's Portuguese. (chuckling comically) - Oh, hey, Gwen. Real quick. What do you think about an Ernest shirt that says, "Ernest Fucking Rules Know What I Mean?" Gwen? Gwen? Gwen? Gwen? Gwen? (foreboding music) Gwen? What are you doing? (instruments clatter) - [Van Brunt] Surprise! (baseball bat smacking) - [Disembodied Voice] Van Brunt. Brunt. Brunt. - Ashley. Gwen. What the fuck happened? - I was going to ask you the same thing. You kids okay? - Caspian, we gotta get out of here now. I think all that Jimmy Van Brunt story is true. Caspian, are you hearing me? Untie us now. Wait. Why haven't you untied us yet? Oh. - Is it slowly coming together, Ben-Ben? - Wait a tick. You? (foreboding music) - Bingo for Ben-o. How do you like my sinister smile? Is it much different than my normal happy-go-lucky smile? I learned that from you, Gwen darling. It's called acting. - Well, you- you fooled me, kid, and that's hard to do. I trained with the best of 'em and, let me say, you certainly pulled off an Oscar-winning performance. Bravo, fruitcake. - Qh it was nothing really. Acting was in my blood. I've had to act my whole life to get away with some of the unspeakable things I have done. And I'm about to do. - And what are you about to do? - Watch you get slaughtered for my own erotic enjoyment. - What? Kill us? - But why? - Because I'm fucking psycho. That's why, nukka. - Well, I guess if there ever was a motive to kill, then that would be number one. - Well, what about all our hombres? (childish giggling) - Ah, your friends. About them... (counter squealing) I ate them. And drank the bones. They were delicious. (both groaning disgustedly) - Oh, fuck. Gross. - Heavens to murgatroyd. - And they were just the appetizers. You cocksuckers are the main course. - And introducing your chef for the evening, Mr. Jimmy Van Brunt. (Jimmy singing) - Caspian's got me workin'. - God. Please stop. - Someday Caspian- - Oh, shut up. - sets me free. - Stop it. - Say, who ordered the tramp with the side order of poopy gash? - Ashley. No. - Oh my stars and garters. He's real. It all makes sense now. He's the puppet and you're the puppeteer. - Quick smart, my shoven cunt. (thudding) I haven't done a lick a killing since way back in the day. And using an incantation I found in this weird fictional tome, I was able to bring back Jimmy's ghoulish form. - How does that grab ya, matzoh grip? (book falling) - What in the fuck is a matzoh grip? - I use James as my death machine. Now, although I've never actually killed myself, he did all my dirty work. I just love to watch all the blood and semen spray all over the ooze. Yummy. - You sick, dirty fuck. You're never gonna get away with this. - Oh really? And what, pray tell, is going to stop us? (dramatic music) (door squeaking) (gun whipping) - Me, motherfucker. - Sister? - (Gwen and Ben) Sister? - Would somebody please tell me what the hell's going on here? - Leo. Untie these kids and get them to safety. - Yes, Miss Ambrosia. (Leo grunting) - Remember me again? - What what what? - I don't even know why I'm savin' your asses. (dramatic screaming) Let's go. C'mon! (gun clicks) - And you. (gunshots) Play dead. Thought I would never find you, Caspian? Thought you could just kill Mom and Dad and never suffer the consequences? - Well, I have done a pretty good job so far, don't you think, sis? And look at you lookin' all butch and ready to rumble. - Mom and Dad got what they deserved. And you were just too blind to see it. - They deserved to die because they bought me the Prince record and you the Captain Geech and the Shrimp Shack Shooters cassette? - Yes they deserved to die. I fucking love Prince. And they knew. Cap'n Geech and the Shrimp Shack Shooters? What the fuck is that? - Yeah, but you were into pirates at the time. - The point is, you always got what you wanted. And I always got shafted. Those motherfuckers bought you a brand new pair of Jordache jeans and me a brand new pair of women's capri pants. I had to tell all my friends the makers ran out of material. And that was the style. - So you killed them for it? Hmm? - Finding that spell was the best thing that ever happened to me. And, for once, I was in control of my own life. I used that fleshly bag of straw to take control of my own destiny. I took life by the nuts and pushed the pedal to the metal. (giggles) - Well. Your killing spree ends here, brother. I waited a long time to avenge our family and, tonight, they shall finally rest in peace. - No, sister. Friends to the end, remember? - This is the end. Friend. (crunching) - Oh. (screaming) (intense rock music) (thudding punches) (kicks whipping) (zombie groans) - Cock-a-doodle ra- Oof. Oh shit. (shrill screaming) (smacking Leo) (hitting tree) - That's it, motherfucker. You've unleashed the beast now. I want your asshole on my wall. Haha. - God, I'm never fuckin' hanging out with you again. - This never woulda happened if we had watched "Thrashin'." - I shoulda went to school and made somethin' of myself. - Ah! I should call my mother. This action needs some cameras pointed at it. Look at this: a movie waiting to be made. Waiting for me to star as Thunder, Battle Queen in The Year 2022. (punching thuds) - Where's Benny Hill when you need him? - Gwen, call the fucking police. - The black and blue? Oh they can't act, kid. Have you seen that show "Cops"? Total amateurs. Why what this needs... is a dance number in the middle of all this bay-os. Yes. With a tune by Dr. Reanimator. We could call it "Terror At Blood Fart Lake." (Leo singing) - Come on, Jim, sittin' in the paddy wagon. Gotta get a rider there. - Why, it'll be bigger than Pluto Nash, I tells ya. Bigger than Pluto Nash. (gushing splash) (strangled whimpering) - Gwen. My buddy. (maniacal laughing) - Bitch. Haha. - Oh yeah. Don't go breakin' my heart. (Thunder moaning) - [Jimmy] Don't forget about me! (thudding) - Oh, fuck you. - Get him, Daddy. Get him. - Fuck you. (squishing stab) (projector whirring) (lighthearted music) - And, so it happens. Gwendolyn Bouvier must take a final bow. Don't fret. I have lived a good life. Growing up to the East Side beat of Downtown Skid Row. I picked myself up from my bootstraps and carried these jugs into stardom, almost. (deep inhale) And, you, the fans. You were there for me, weren't you? Watching me screw my way to the top of the Hollywood elite. Thank you. (plastic squeaking) Oh, Ben. Ben, you were always there for me, weren't you? Oh, Ben, you were such a good friend. A friend, that would, from time to time do me from behind when you needed a friend with benefits. Ben, I shall miss you. And you, Ashley. The clodhopper I just met for the very first time. Why, I remember when we used to spin yarns about the size of Tim Conway's flesh prunes. I shall miss you as well. - Right back atcha, weirdo. - Oh and you. Oh, Scarecrow, I will always remember the time you killed all of my friends in a slew of grue and gore. I shall miss you most of all. - You're a saucy dame. Don't ever change. (neck snaps) Ah. (drums kick in) - Kill her, Jimmy. Kill her. (guffawing) - "Fuck Amelia" sucked. Fuck you, asshole. - Oh, come on. You asshole. You ruined my weekend. - You're choking the shit out of me. Jimmy, help your master. (Jimmy chuckling) - I'm sendin' you back to Hell, Jimmy. (thud) Oh, my clavicula. Oh my God. - Your reign of pornography is over. - You? (whipping) (thudding punch) (high-pitched whine) - Oh mine jewels. Oh my achilles balls. Oh what a world. (dramatic horns) Do you smell fish? - Frampton comes alive. (squelching stab) (Jimmy gurgling) - [Leo] Get some brains, Scarecrow. Get some brains. Jimmy Van Brunt and I don't give a fuck. - Ooh. Jimmy, no. (Jimmy gurgling) - I'm popping mad. Orville Reddenbacher's got nothing on the scarecrow of cabin duster. (wild laughter) (whipping kick) (water splashing) - Word. - Huh? (footsteps) - You hold that fucker, Ben. (honking) And you tie his squirelly ass up. - You daughter of a bitch. Once again, you've one-upped me. But I'll bring about another ghoul. And bring a whirlpool of pain upon you and your soul. And then, he'll bite your nipples and they'll bleed and crack. And I'll piss in 'em. And they'll sweat and sting. - Caspian, my brother, you leave me no choice. You shall never kill again, for I am your destruction. I've been training for this moment for years. And my powers are now strong enough to execute the task at hand. - Huh? - And, now, I shall envelope you around my backdoor entryway. - Come again? - The sasquatchian mystics of the Adirondack Mountains gave me this gift. The only way to truly destroy your evil is to ritualistically shove your whole body into my asshole. For once inside my cavity, you shall be eaten alive by a small army of saber-tooth leeches which I have been raising in my bowels for months. Once they have suckled and feasted upon your soft flesh, I shall then poop you back out in a shit storm of nothing but hair and bones. - And you thought I was sick and twisted? - Ben, pick him up. Leo, you help him. - You're on your own with this one, sister. - Oh you big baby. Are you ready, Ben? (Caspian crying shrilly) - I guess so. Wait, are we really gonna shove this dude into your asshole? - No. - Yes. It's the only way. Now, stick that fucker in my ass. - There's a million other ways, bitch. Come on. - Death awaits you, my squirrelly brother. Get in my ass. (upbeat bass music) (Caspian shouting) (squishing) (sharp cracking) (alien slurping) (loud jazzy music) (Thunder moaning) - Oh God. They're eating his flesh. Oh. Leo, Ben. Hold me for support. - I'm here, miss lady girl. Come on. (Thunder straining) - Come on. - What's going on? Tell me. - I'm going to excrete my brother from my ass. - Shit those bones out, woman. Shit like a vikin'. (Thunder groans) - His bones are leaving the fatty tissue of my loins. - Oh my- - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Help me. Help me. - What do you want me to do? What am I doin'? - Help me, you bitch. (skin stretching) (Thunder groaning) - I can see him. I can see him coming. - See you in Hell, brother. (wet flatulence) (bones clattering) (breathing heavily) - Thank you. Thank you, boys. I couldn't have done this without you. - Girl, I'm gonna need a lot more than a thank you for all that bullshit I just witnessed. I should be at home watchin' Bill Cosby and eatin' Jell-O puddin'. Instead I'm at this shitty lake, bustin' up scarecrow ghouls and watchin' fat kids go up in your ass. Hell of a story for the grandkids, though. - I hate my life. - Does anyone have a moist towelette? (upbeat music)
