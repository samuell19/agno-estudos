I thought y'all were leaving town. - Don't mess with me, Dean. - Hey baby. I'm just trying to make your dreams come true. It's what I do. I make people's dreams come true. If it were up to me, you wouldn't have to work a day in your life. Unless you wanted to. - Well, I want to. I'll do whatever I can to get Luke away from you and this town. - No one put a gun to his head. Luke's just an enterprising man. (men laughing) - Pardon me miss, is that your El Camino parked out front with Michigan plates? - Yes. Were you down driving by the river last night? - Now Elias, are you telling me a family of Yankee tourists can't come all the way down to Texas without visiting the Rio Grande without being under your suspicions? I mean, is nobody safe? - I was in the motel with my baby. - Well, that's real strange 'cause there's Rio Grande dirt all over your car. - Now, she didn't say she didn't go down the river, did you hear her say she didn't go down the river. She said she didn't go down to the river last night. Now, honestly Elias, lots of tourists come down here to see the Rio Grande. That's what they come down here for. - Yep. - Hon, you will excuse my ignorance but it's the first time I ever saw a tourist in a waitress uniform. Now, to the best of your recollection, what time did you take your little sightseeing tour down by the river last night. - Listen to what you're saying. I mean, he already runs one guy off the road, now he's gunning for an innocent woman. Elias, this town's gonna file a complaint with the Border Control if you don't back off. - You know, there's a nasty echo in this place. I wanna thank you for your cooperation. And I'm sure if I need your help again, you'll do everything you can, won't ya? - Yes. - That's a good girl. Y'all outta get out and enjoy some of that beautiful Texas sunshine today. Weather man says it's going to be a beaut. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - Where have you been? - Connie gave me a job waitressing at the diner. I was gonna call you but we got busy. - [Luke] I told you that I was gonna take care of us. - I don't want you risking your life for a few lousy bucks. - Nicky, it's more than a few bucks! What are we gonna do? Live off your tips? If we don't go to California, I lose the job. - That cop I told you about, he knows what's going on. He saw the dirt on our car and he was asking me questions. - What did you tell him? - Dean was there. He said that we were tourists sightseeing down at the river. - Yeah. Yeah, Dean's a clever one, huh? It's fortunate how he's always around. - You need to get another job. - Dean, you think we oughta hang low for a while? - What's on your mind, Webb? - Jimmy Neil. Worried about Elias. - Worried about old Elias? Jimmy Neil got careless. He slipped up. Hey. Elias couldn't find his dick if he were playing with it. - Can always go back to Detroit. - No. I've spent my entire life dreaming of working on the stock car circuit. Every day for four years I went to work on that assembly line wondering what the hell I was doing there. And when it closed down, I spent another eight months wishing I had any job at all. I want my son to be proud of me. (gentle music) (tense music) - Hey, look alive, Yankee boy. Got to stay alert. - Where'd you get Yankee boy from? I lived in Detroit, not New England. - Far as I'm concerned, anyone born north of the Mason-Dixon line's still a Yankee. - How long have you lived in Texas? - What do you mean? - I mean, how long have you lived in Texas? - I've never been anywhere in my life but Texas. Never wanted to be. - So, why do you smuggle? I mean, you own your own gas station, you don't need the money. - I do it for the same reason you do it. Because I can. - I'm doing it because my wife and I need the money. You get that? - Okay. How long you been married? - Three years. Known each other since junior high. - You a lucky man. Beautiful wife, nice kid. What the hell you wanna go to LA for? - Nicky and I have always wanted to go to California. I finally got a job there. It makes her happy. - Yeah, I guess I'd do the same thing to hold onto a woman like that. - Yeah. That's why I'm not letting her go. - (whistles) Hey, look alive. They're coming. - Hilario, I'm gonna buy you a damn watch so you show up on time. - I ought to get you a hammock so you can learn to relax, amigo. - Relax? Wait a minute? What's going on?

We got to get on the road first thing. So, if you can just give me my money I'll get going. - Like hell you will. - What? - You heard Hilario. We've got the last group of Mexicans tomorrow night. I'm gonna need you. - You and I agreed to tonight. - No, no, no, see. That's not what we agreed. What we agreed to is that you would help with this last group of mestizos. All right, ain't my fault they late. Job ain't finished yet. - That wasn't the deal. Give me my fucking money. - (laughs) Can you believe this guy? All right, all right. Take it easy. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. On account of our little misunderstanding, I'll give you the $500 I owe you plus a $500 bonus just for being you. Should be enough to take you to Hollywood in grand old style. - Dean, I need that fucking money right now. Do you understand me? - You don't understand. I ain't asking. You understand? Now, if you don't help us with this last group of mestizos tomorrow night then you and that precious little family of yours will never leave this town. (laughs) Don't be so sad. I can't stand it when you're sad. All right, come on now. You with me? Now, you do the job tomorrow and we're outta there. Okay, now have a beer. - Don't make me do this, Dean. - Tomorrow night, the job's finished, all right? Now have a damn beer. Come on, it's party time. (metal clanks) Now that's a waste of a perfectly fine beer. Come on, Luke. (birds chirping) (slow music) Morning, Ms. Nicole. If I known you was working, I'd waited to order. - Nicky take these pies over to table six. - Connie, did you hear what happened? They found a bunch of illegals locked in a box car last night. The box car was filled with pesticides. - What happened to them? - The Border Control took them to the hospital for observation. (glass breaking) What got into her? - Now, Nicole, don't go away mad. Can't stand to see people mad. - This is between me and my husband. - Oh now normally I like to stay out of these marital disputes but this does concern me. Don't judge us too harshly. - It's too late for that. - Luke didn't know, hell I didn't know. Thought we was doin' 'em a favor. - You call that a favor? Locking up families in a box car full of pesticides? - Well, most folks would've just left them out in the desert. - Oh, that's suppose to make me feel better? You almost killed those people and Luke helped. - Nothing happened, nobody got hurt. - Get out of my way. - You're not going anywhere, Miss Nicole. Didn't Luke tell ya? He ain't fulfilled his part of the deal yet. - He won't do it, we're leaving. - Suit yourself. I sure would like to see you tomorrow. - Hey, how's my girl? Did you forget something. - The box car you locked those people in was filled with pesticides. - I don't understand, Dean said they were gonna be fine. Nicky, he swore to me they were on a train to Houston. - Listen to me, you're gonna help me pack the car now and we're gonna get as far away from here as we can. We'll drive all night if we have to. - He didn't pay me, we don't have any money! - I don't care, Luke, we're getting out of here now. - Look out the window. - So what, we're prisoners now? Is this how you're gonna take care of us? I'm going to the police. - And what are you gonna tell them? Huh? What are you gonna tell them, Nicky? My husband's smuggling illegals? Do you want me to go to prison? Is that it? Nicky, all those illegal aliens are trying to do is make a better life for themselves and their families. That's all I'm trying to do for us. - Maybe I can't stop you from hurting yourself, but I can stop you from hurting me and Tyler. We're leaving, it's for the best. - It's for the best? Don't tear my family apart and try and tell me it's for the best. Don't! - Afternoon. Look at those thunder heads. Weather man said it's gonna be a real ass kicker. - Gonna be a hell of a night for a crossing. - Well, at least Elias and his boys won't expect us to try nothin'. - Oh yeah, what do you make of that? - Son, I realize you're not from these parts so I don't expect you to know every little thing that's going on around here. But you have a real nice little family and I sure would hate to seem 'em get hurt. - I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. Is there a problem, officer? - Do you know what the Navajos call a coyote? A trickster. You see, to the Indians, a coyote is a deceiver. Someone who not only steals from you but loves doing it. Just a little something for you to bear in mind. - Why are you telling me this? - Your family needs you. You need them. Think about it. - I don't need you to tell me how to take care of my family. I'm not doing anything wrong, you hear? - Good. I'm glad to hear that. You have a nice day. - This can't be good. - Elias already saw-- - He already suspects us. - Well, so what, you don't think he's gonna turn us in. - Let's hope for Nicky's sake he ain't that stupid. - Guess we're about to find out. - What's up with you, boy, look like you just saw Hank William's ghost. - We need to talk about this. I can't do this tonight. - Come on. Now, Luke, I'm just as heartbroke as you are about those folks in the box car. But we're innocent. How was I suppose to know there was any poison in that box car? - You know what? I don't believe you. If I do this run tonight, my wife is gonna leave me. You hear me? - Yeah but Luke, you got the car. - What? Are you fucking crazy? She'll take the bus, Dean. You don't know her. She sets her mind to something, that's it. I'm not gonna do this run tonight. - I understand, 'course, I don't gotta be a family man to understand the situation you're in. I'll take of your wife. - Leave us the fuck alone! (gun clicks) - You're driving. Webb, follow us in the truck. (intense music) (thunder rumbling) Hey Webb, you wanna do a little babysitting? - Oh yeah. Come on now, Luke! You be back real soon now, Dean. (knocking) Ah ah ah. - How's my hair? - Who is it? - It's Dean. Evening, Miss Nicole. - What do you want? - Luke asked me to stop by. (baby crying) I know you've endured a lot on this trip. - No you don't know. - Let me get right to the point. Luke's coming with us tonight. But I wanna make it up to you. I'll give you solemn promise that this is the absolute last time. - You act like Luke's one of your illegals that you just haggle over for money. - Everything comes with a price, Miss Nicole. Including your trip Hollywood. - How 'bout openin' up, huh? How 'bout openin' up? Come on, Luke. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - You're a very special woman, Miss Nicole. Let's hope Luke knows how lucky he is to have you. - Get out. - Oh, that's nice. You know Nicky, she's a lucky gal. You got a pretty mouth. - Here we go. - Yeah. - Look forward to doing it again. You girls have a good time? - Oh, we're having a big time. Aren't we Luke. We're having a big time. - I want you to go in, say goodbye, keep it short and sweet, or we're coming in. - Be back real soon, yeah. - Nicky, I'm so sorry. You're still leaving? - Unless you wanna drive away right now. Dean's waiting outside. Do you understand? I have no choice. Nicky, this is gonna work out. You have to believe me. We'll leave in the morning. - That's a boy knows how to follow orders. Slow down now, we're not riding in this one, it's too hot. You're driving in one of Webb's old trucks tonight. (car engine starts) (Nicky sniffs) - Hi, Connie. - It's late, is something wrong? - No, I just thought that I'd drop by to have a cup of coffee. - Think I'll join ya. (Nicky crying) I'm worried about that young waitress and her family. She was practically in tears yesterday. - Yeah, that sweet little gal's husband has gotten himself tangled up with Dean. - They're good people, Elias. - We'll see about that. - Why do you always have to be so hard on folks? You always push everyone away. - Like you? - I found out what it's like to make a mistake around you. - Hon, that young boy's not just making a mistake, he's breaking the law. (Nicky cries) ♪ When you run ♪ Out of places to hide ♪ When you run - Unit 208, this is 214 ♪ From what's rolling aside (Elias sighs) ♪ Walk with me, I'll take you to the fire ♪ - Duty calls. ♪ Walk with me, I'll never let you down ♪ (thunder rumbles) - Well now, Luke, saw you talking to Elias today. Thought you might be cutting a deal or something. - Are you guys getting paranoid? - I'm just saying it would be an awful nasty night for Nicky and that little kid of yours if you was to sell us out. - You know what? I've heard enough about my wife from you. Let's just finish the job we came here to do, so I can take my family and get the fuck out of here. - Good, if there's no problem, we won't bring Nicky into this. (lighter clicks) - No smoking. I said, put the goddamn cigarette out. - Come on girls, don't make me pull this truck over. - It is pulled over! - Then shut up. (thunder rumbles) - Think it's Hilario? - If it is, it's the first time in memory, he's ever showed up on time. - Webb, think maybe it's a coyote? I mean, a real one. - Now, if you were a dog, would you be out on a night like this? - Right, yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Be that stupid, you'd have to be human, right? - You gotta get your mind right, Luke. (all laugh) - Hey Luke, why don't you got check it out? - Why don't you go check it out, Dean, hm? - (laughs) 'Cause this ain't a democracy. And even if it was, Webb would vote with me. Go check it out. - What do you think, guys? Maybe I should have a gun? - I don't have a spare. You got a spare? - No. - We don't have a spare. Don't want you shooting yourself in the foot. Don't want you shooting the merchandise either. Now, go check it the fuck out. (tense music) (knocking) - Hi. - Hi. - I wanted to bring you this, didn't know if you'd be here. - Calm down, calm down. Let me have the baby. Come on, come on. (Nicky crying) What's the matter? - I'm leaving. Tyler and I are leaving. Luke, we were desperate, we lost all our money. - And Dean gave him work. (Nicky cries) Shh shh. Elias told me. Hold on. Here. Don't leave your husband. He's a good husband and he loves you. Maybe you'll find your dream in California or maybe you won't. But don't get stuck her on the borderline, you go find out and you take him with you. He needs you. Men aren't strong like us. Strong. (gentle music) It's gonna be okay. Look at him. - Thank you. What about you, Connie? - I take my comfort where I can find it. (thunder rumbles) (coyote howling) - That's him. - About time. - Let's go. - All right, this is it, let's go get 'em. (intense music) (men whispering) - What did I tell you, my friend? Hilario's a man of his word. - Give me the money. - Don't spend it all in one place, amigo. - Come on. (tense music) (shouting in foreign language) - Freeze, this is the Texas Border Control! You are all under arrest! Put your hands in the air where we can see them. Now! (guns firing) (tense rock music) (guns banging) - Where the hell is Luke? - I told you that dog sold us out. Fucking race car. (man screaming) - Let's get out of here. Come on! (guns firing) Come on! (guns firing) Fuck you! (car tires squealing) (guns firing) (tense music) - Damn Elias! - What the hell we gonna do now, huh? That Luke sold us out. I told he was no good, Dean. The hell we gonna do now? - I lived my whole life in this town. Now, I gotta slink away into the night like a mangy coyote. All for Mr. Hollywood. - Told ya! (guns firing) (tires squealing) The hell are you doing? - I'm not leaving till I settle this score. - Dean, we gotta get the hell outta here! - We got the hell out of here when I say we get the hell out of here. (tires squealing) (car tires squealing) What in the heck are you doing? - I'm getting ready. - Getting ready for what? You what, you think she's got an army at the motel? - Gotta be prepared, Dean. - What are you, a fucking boy scout? Give me a .38. - No, no, I hate automatics, they always jam on me, I wanna use the .38. - I'll use the 38, give me the Luger. The Luger! - Actually now that you mentioned it, I believe I could use the automatic. You use the .38. (intense music) (sirens wail) Yeah, yeah, motherfucker. - Dean? - What? - This automatic's creeping me out, I wanna use a .38. - Fine, you use the .38. Just give me a fucking gun! (knocking) - Where's Luke? - Darling, Nicole, we got a little problem, I'm not gonna lie to you. It's real bad. Luke's hurting. He's bleeding, he's bleeding a lot in the head area. I got him over at the garage. He's asking for ya. - Why didn't you take him to the hospital? - Now, you know we can't. You know we can't do that, so let us bring you over there to him. - You know what, Dean. This time she ain't buying your shit. (Nicky screams) Drop it or I'll drop you. Drop it! - Unbelievable. Unbelievable. - Drop it! - Glad you went first? - Put it down! - What did you do with Luke, you said he was hurt! - Ah, shut up! (Nicky screams) I lied, I lied! Listen, Nicky, okay, your husband sold us out. He betrayed us to Elias for money. Now I'm gonna take you down to the river and make you drink. Oh, great! - Get the hell out of here. Grab the kid! - Tyler! Tyler! Tyler! - [Webb] Whores like you always think you're gonna get your own fucking way! - My baby! You animals! My baby! - Bitch! - My baby. Please, leave my baby. (baby screaming) Tyler! - What'd you think was gonna happen, Nicky, huh? Think you were just gonna walk away? (baby crying) - Tyler! Please, just leave my baby. You take me, just leave my baby. Leave my baby. - Don't go getting all motherly on me. Get! (Tyler crying) - I got it on channel three. I got it on channel three. Where's the remote control? - Please! - How come you ain't got a remote control? - [Nicky] Tyler, Tyler! (crying) - There's gotta be civilized people watching, how come you ain't go no remote control? (items crashing) You have a whole place here without a friggin' remote control! God dammit! (Dean shouting) (glass crashing) - Tyler, Tyler! (baby crying) Move away from me or I'll kill you. - [Webb] Fucking whore! - Nicky! (guns firing) (slow, tense music) (Nicky screaming) - What you running from, girl? Just looking for the right moment to propose. Get a farm, have a couple chickens. - What the hell kind of mess you got yourself into now, boy? (Nicky whimpering) - They got a nice little chapel just north of here. Elvis impersonators and everything. (Nicky screams) Oh, you know you want me to catch ya. - [Elias] Come on! - Now if you just keep running, you're gonna get tired, and if you get tired, you're gonna just get all cranky. (tense music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (Dean laughs) (gun fires) (Dean laughs) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Goddamn! - This one's for Webb, you ass-licking' cocksucker. (gun fires) (Elias grunts) Yankee boy. (laughs) (gun fires) (Dean grunts) (Dean groans) (gun fires) (Dean screams) (Dean laughs) - Luke? Shh shh, it's all right. It's all right. (Tyler crying) - It's okay. (soft music) Are you okay? (Elias groans) - Are you gonna be all right? - I want you to take your little family out and put 'em in that car. - Yeah. - Drive north up to I-10 West and just don't look back, you understand? Now go on. Wait a minute. I almost forgot. There's a bounty on coyotes in Texas. Now get out of here.
