One meter and 69. T5 kilos. White skin. Male. Can you be sure? Mer all, when does a man prove he is really a man? The description of the body is essential: dark brown eyes, gFey beaFd, messy haiF... Look at his lungs. Heavy... full of blood. What a pity. _e is also Felevant. It's a crucial information. Here, 38 years in blank. Look at this beautiful liver. A pe_ect colour. Not a drop of alcohol. Afew trips, no love stoy at all, a poor bi_raphy... ln op_ition with the never ending enthusiasm of his paFtneF who still cheers with a healthy liver. Cause of death: The lung cavity was filled with blood due to puncture. A projectile from a fire gun. l want you to sign it. Astrong body, never even caught a cold. But sometimes can succumb to ino#ensive spicy food. So, Artur, are you signing it? His brother is waiting! finally the cause of death: Died foolish due to a heart attack or a severe crisis ofdepression in some lonely place, like a dreay governmental department. You can close the body now. We got the report. l like your shoes, Artur. Unusual. Lara. She is almost a preq woman. l can feel her bl_ irrigating her heart. lt's a pity that some ofher veins are obstructed. Go and give this report that you have signed. -The brother is quite impatient. -Why don't you give it to him? You give it. BODY _y number 2339. lt was shot near his right shoulder by a police investigator duFing a chase of _o dFug dealeFs. A routine operation. What happened? An internal haemorrhage, caused by a bullet. lt's all here in the report. Who shot him? l don't know. He was found like this. Probably killed by his own chaps. He had one milligram of cocaine in his blood. What? That's not right. That can't be right! Calm down, l have no idea what happened. l just know about the body. That's all. Did he feel any pain? No... Take your time. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time. An astFay bullet. He was shot by the policeman at one in the morning. He died _enty four hours later. He bled to his death. lf only he had been rescued in time... What a stupid death. -Lara, l'd like to ask you something. -Do it while l'm in a good mood. Could l have the rest of the day off? Don't even think about it. Today was a such a stressful day, this stoy... Artur, forget it. ln a few moments this place will be hectic. l will need evey one here. But... -l'd swap with my weekend off. -No. -Get out, Artur. -l can't see anything. But you can hear it. Do you have a problem with it? With you? No, not at all. So let me in. That's enough! Get the hell out of here, Artur! Go home! A disturbing breath, slightly acid. On her _enties, a neFvous gastFitis. At thim, the fiFst stages of an ulceF. At fom: stomach canceF. Cause of death: swallowed what she never wanted. Twenty years of alcoholism, a son pFematuFely deceased. Three eternal love a#airs, but neither one good enough to last. fortunately, an acute case of cirrhosis ended a chronic seFies of impaiFments. Her skin contains no marks apart from a small tattoo. Some oriental ide_ram at the pelvis next to the pubic hairs. Her breasts, small but firm, is lightly rosy. An analysis of heF gastFic _uids revealed traces of a poisonous substance. Suicide? It needs moFe investigation. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! -What happened? Did you fall? -You came for dinner, honey? Today, of all days. There's nothing here to eat. It's Dora's day off. Did you get hurt, mom? Do you feel any pain? -Your father and l are going out to eat. -Where's dad? My right leg... lt hurts a lot. What happened to you? Why are you naked? -She fell down in the... -lt was nothing. Would you stop that! You keep rubbing her leg and then she'll be up all night complaining about the pain. lt's always like that! What a creep! Thank you, mom. Don't forget your birthday. Be here on time. No need for that, mom. l'm more than grown up. What you talking about? Evey year we celebrate. All right, we'll see about that later. We better take a look at mom's leg. -When l return l'll recommend someone. -Ok. Bye, mom. -Bye, dad. -Bye. Hello... Lara... l can't hear you... Really? But now? Can't you call Pedro? From the east side. And Heitor? Ok, Lara... Ok... Bye. What is this corpse doing along with the bones? What do you think? Evidence dumping. Are you sure? Come on, you've seen the mess outside. Just do yourjob. l really need your help. So, shall we open the young lady? -Have you finished the autopsy? -Yes. A severe case of a spanked body. Evidence being dumped... Has anyone come looking for her? No, but l'd like you to have a look. lt's a strange case. lf you think it's strange, send to pathology. They'll love it. No, Lara. It was a violent death. Murder. Look, the bones are our priority now. Forget this corpse! -Can l help you? -The bones, they are all in a mess. They are being meticulously catalogued. Now if you pardon me, you cannot stay here. My son is here. Don't wory. We are doing our best to have all the bones identified. -l give you my word for it, Mrs... -Mariangela. Could you give us any statement, doctor? The index finger and the thumb ofthe left hand are broken. Apart from that, the hands are pemect. Long fingers traced by fine blue vessels. lt's too early to confirm that the bones belong to the political victims from the dictatorship time. They have to be examined and confronted with X-Rays and dental records brought by the families. The damage is all over, bruises that go deep into the skin. And now it start to get into a pFocess of quick putFefaction. Why the bones and not the corpse? The time of death is a mystey, Professor. Months, years... lt seems that she will fall apart, disappear. Paulo? l've never seen anything like that. The skin... Take a look, Lara. The smell is still raw and muggy. Saponification maybe? According to Artur, the viscera are still intact. An excessive dose of antibiotics, who knows... -Where did this corpse come from? -lt was found with the bones at the grave. Well, it may need a deeper analysis. -Could you do the procedure? -Ok. Thanks, Paulo. So? Artur? Well, Lara, l can't say for sure yet, but it really seems a saponification. The fact is: she got preserved. l'd say that she belongs to the findings, the same time, somewhere between 1969 and 1974. Paulo? Your theoy is nice, eloquent, but it is not real. This young woman died at its utmost three days ago. The signs are vey clear. The rigidity of the carcass and... Take a look, Lara... the corneas opacity Ieave no room for doubts. lt's recent. That's obvious. Thanks, Paulo. Vey kind of you. My pleasure, Lara. l am not wasting anymore time with this corpse. lt is a standard procedure. Do you get it, Artur? Artur, no one can know about this, hum... -How do l... -Good Afternoon. Good Afternoon. l'd like to do a research in the Police files. You just write the name of the person you are looking for. A name... The thing is, l still don't have a name. l would have to go through the registers. All the registers, you mean? No. Only the ones from 1964 to 1979. You can only research three files per time. Where should we start? To use them you have to wear these gloves. We close at 5 o'clock. The files are collected at 4:30. Good luck. ANY PERSON WHO READS THIS DOCUMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS SECRECY The terrorist belongs to an avant-garde theatre group. She is beautiful, provocative and vey skilful foF FecFuiting nai've _ple. Taken part in subversive events and three armed actions. She was found after a denunciation made by _o suburb kids. You can't sleep here. Look at the mess you've done now! We're collecting the files in 10 minutes. Teresa Prado Noth, 24 years old. Arrested in 19T3. Militancy on an illegal pam organization. Nog... Nos... Nossig... Notario... Notarnicola... fernanda P. Noth... Teresa P. Noth... Dead or alive? Hello. l want to talk to a relative of Teresa Prado Noth. Who am l talking to? Artur. Dr. Artur Teller. You are... But... l am probably mistaken. Forgive me. l thought Teresa was... l... Sory, to whom am l speaking to? Fernanda, could you come down to the morgue to recognize a corpse? Teresa Prado Noth. Fourteen. So... Lara, you won't believe that. l think l've discovered the identity of the corpse. So, somebody came to recognize it. Not yet. But l found... -What's wrong? -My back. l'm dead. Too much pressure, huh? People think that bones come with a name, ID number. They think it's easy. Artur, l don't want to know about your discoveries. That's not our business and l won't have any exceptions. Somebody has to come and claim the corpse. lf by tomorrow, nobody shows up, we're going to buy it. -But l already know... -Tomorrow! lt cannot be buried like that! -The press needs to know about this body. -That's it, Artur. Go ahead, talk to the press. Tell them about your mummy and leave me alone. Tell them you've found Nephertity. They'll love it. Where's my mother? Teresa Prado Noth. She's the wrong age to be my mother. This corpse is not recent. l thought the dead rotted. Wasn't your mother a left-wing militant? A missing person? No way. My mother is always around. Never missed. -Don't you know her? -No. Teresa Prado Noth... The sociologist. ls your mother alive? Sory for disappointing you. But she could be my sister. You want to know who she is? lt's the standard to identify the corpse, hand it over to the relatives for a decent burial. And what would be an indecent burial? Unclaimed corpse, number 2342. Cardboard coffin. Suburb graveyard. Tomorrow. Well, after you're dead, what's the difference? None, l suppose. Look, sory for having brought you down here. This stoy about morgue, body, mother... It's unforgivable. No problem, l enjoy it. Have you got any other corpses to look at? Who knows, l might recognize someone. So, let's go? l need to... My mother probably knows who she is. Your mother? Teresa Prado Noth? l was sure you knew her. No, all l know is that she was arrested during the dictatorship. Arrested, my mother? Never! But l have... You sure? Wasn't she arrested in 1973? l was born in 73. My mother. This picture is not recent. Ch_e one to wear. The secret is the adequacy. The right oumit at the right moment. Otherwise it draws too much attention. lt's di#icult to go unnoticed. he secret is the adequacy. She always comes here. She won't take long. l can't stay long. l need to go back to work. -Excuse me. -After killing my mother, the least you could do is to have lunch with me. What about leak chartreuse with partridge escalope and honey? Pretty expensive here... Eat your partridge and chew your pineapple. Your end is coming, bourgeois! ls it _sible the existence of _o identical bodies, with no genetic relation? No. Two bodies are never identical. Hmm, this is delicious. l think the smell of the morgue opened my appetite. -No, thanks! -Ty it. It's vey good. l don't want it. So? lt needs more salt. You're right. And you... What do you do? l'm an actress. Listen, are you playing around with me? lt's already two o'clock. l've got things to do. l don't want to rush you. This is not enough to cover my part. l don't have any money. My mother was going to pay for me. No problem, l'll pay for you. lt's the least after this mess. No way. This restaurant is too expensive. The food was lousy. The wine was passed. Only someone like my mother could like coming here. He was induced into crime by a common swindler. An im_tor who pretends to be someone else and then another and another... She's already been a militant, a coFpse and a daughteF. What else is she going to be? Give me back my wallet! Listen to me. Doctor Artur Teller. Born on the 11th of July 1968. Son of Estela Teller and Henrique Teller. Give me back my wallet. This has gone too far! l've got to pay for these. Real cheap. You know how it is an artistic career. One day, gloy and fame, the next, failure and misey. l've got to go back to work. l'm not an actress. That's for sure. You don't have the least talent. -Listen, we've got to find my mother. -Forget your mother. The first attack was a failure. The restaurant. Only g_ for refuelling. 8ut now, we can't make any moFe mistakes. That's the one. for more than ten years her body was working based on some sort of dope or hallucin_en. lt was gFadually undeFmining the lung and the nervous system in a vey slow and pFogFessive action. Her movements were becoming confused, dispeFsed. Laughed with no reason, IeR places without p9ing bills, walked aFound always caFeless. And the accident was fatal. Run over in the middle of the mernoon mer leaving a underpants shop. Are you going to say anything or you're just going to watch? Cranial traumatism. Smashed by a lift door while he was doing the maintenance. The company wants blood samples tested to check if the employee was drunk. If alcohol is found, no claims will be paid to the family. Don't be mean, Lara. Fill in as if there was no alcohol. This poor man... Abandoning the work is really bad. l just went for lunch. A rather long lunch, hum... l had to cover for you. Who did you have lunch with? Nephertity? lMAGE NOT AVAILABLE How did you get in here? You can't. Leave the body! This is not a toy. You have to leave. What's that? Edemas caused by a punishment cane. Third degree burns caused by cigarettes. Lesions provoked by electric shock. Teresa Prado Noth. Sociol_ist, 52 years old, 11 thousand links on internet, a file in the Police archives. Dead or alive? 4 p.m., meeting with Dr. Artur Teller. Forensic issues. DEAD OR NEVER BORN? What's your relationship with her? Sister? Friend? Teresa Prado Noth. She was interrogated and then released. That's all we've got. What's your relationship with her? Sister? Friend? Hello... Yes, speaking... A congress. When? Unfortunately, l have another appointment on this date. Perhaps another time... Besides, l disagree with the way Oswaldo approaches this issue. We've already discussed this before... lt's a personal matter... Bye. -Was that phone call for you? -Yes, it was. A personal detail can be crucial in a pFocess of identification: a watch, a tattoo, a scaF, a Fing... -Doctor, please. -Excuse me, but not now. lt's only a quick question. Sory but l really can't help you right now... Georgia! Calm down, doctor. Look at me! Go and talk to Dr. Lara. She is the one in charge here. Georgia, where is the body? The one that came with the bones. Where's the body? Which body? We have dozens of them here. You know which. Oh, your body. Who took it? Relatives. They came and recognized it. Let me see the form. Later. l'll be back at night. l'm off duty now. You know l am extremely strict with my work schedule. Bye, Artur. She wakes up in the middle of the play. Opens the eyes. lt can't be a mere drama scene, Helena. She wakes up. A singulaF sensation. Wake up. The director shouts. It lacks cruelty. Open the eyes. Wake up. l want to see the form for the corpse number 2342. lt's not in the filling cabinet. l don't know, Artur. Go and talk to Dr. Lara. She is the one in charge here. -And so? -Nothing. -But what about her? -She's been kidnapped. By Dr. Lara. Lara is a practical person. She always goes to the same places. The same restaurant for lunch, The same bar at happy-hour. All of them near her work. Lara is a hundred percent connected to the morgue. A disciplined body for sure. Her atrophied muscles show an advanced stage of moral decom_ition. Nothing is leR of the brilliant doctor who's got first place at the police exams. Tests on her viscera disclose high levels of bitterness in her bile. The rigidity of her dental arcade inhibits any smile. All factors point to the cause of death: PFagmatic tFaumatism. C'mon, l think it's empty. Come here. Let's go, quick... Let me do it... Oh, yes... l know you're in there. lf l shoot three times, l can't miss it. Give me your purse. This is for a revolutionay cause. You should cooperate! Give me your purse, bitch! You're dead, Doctor Lara. Tomorrow one of your colleagues will be dissecting you. -What's that? Let's go. -No more playing around! Where's the body you've confiscated? Answer it! Artur, l know it's you. No more playing around! You're a dead man. Your brain and liver should be confiscated and kept foF studies of depFession. Your heart and genitalia foF studies of impotency. ) Mur you'Fe a dead man. A doorslam, a car that passes by. The death is alw9s around. One day I went out in disguise. Wearing these clothes on. Looking like a Lady. l had a fixed spot, Helena, at the door ofa Cinema. l went in. I saw a man having sex with a dead woman. The prostitute was up to any role. A man followed me to the bathroom. We went in. We stayed there for hours. l was up to any role. M9be itwas only forfive minutes. l had a fixed spot. At the door ofa Cinema. l went in. Mom! Mom, where are you? Come in. Sit down. Do you like this song? Why, don't you? Weird... Your shoes are too. They are off now. Ok. l will take the record off. No, leave it... You have _o new messages. fiFst message: Teresa, this is Oswaldo. l think we need to talk. l've been told you got upset with the invitation. But why? Please, call me. Second message: Mom, pick up! Are you there oFyoujust died? Call me. l haven't seeing you around the university. l've stopped for a while... l'm going to travel. -Where are you going? -London. Andrea got me ajob as waiter in a place she works. So, l've got to go now. Think about it, Tiago. We can rent a better place for you. Come on, Teresa, don't take this route. l'm going an_ay.

And when l phoned you It was a mistake Your name l don't know l forgot at the piano the foolish things l would s9 Teresa Teresa lt's not Teresa, it's Ligia. Ligia! He extends the ''igia'' because there are two vowels at the end. -Teresaaa -lt's doesn't sound the same. lt's not as beautiful... Where are my shoes? l don't know. lt's a little too tight. Call my mom. Tell her that l've died. l'll go to real life, Helena. l'm more than grown up. l'll go to real life. l'll be someone. Will be in newspapers. Television. Will have all the men. Women... l don't want my documents, Helena. lt's dangerous to be around with only one identity. Whoever enters to the guerrilla lives an aveFage of... Sometimes it's you against four or five policemen. Someone is going to... Your name? Teresa Prado Noth. Who are you looking for? My daughter. -Name? -Fernanda Prado Noth. lt's not in our registy. When you last saw her? l don't know. l can't remember. Could you describe her? Age, any particular features? 29 years old, one meter and 65, 55 kilos, green eyes. Chee_ul, lively. St9 there. It's silly coming to S?o Paulo. l'm on the move. Can't give you my addFess, Helena. Not now. lt's silly coming. Stay theFe. The city is dim, miserable. Lots of pollution. All is wFong. Stay theFe. l won't be able to call you. Not now. l'm on the move. City is dim, authoFitaFian. No love stoy at all. lt's silly coming. All is wrong. Stay there. Today l thought you had died. So did l. There you are... lt's my face. -My hands. -No. They are vey similar. lt's more than a simple bone formation. He was the one who called me to come here? Did you call her? You know that is irregular. He works here. Teresa Prado Noth. ls that you? Doesn't look like me. There is only one registered Teresa Prado Noth. The same that is in the phone directoy, on the internet, at the libray, at the Police's files. You are Teresa Prado Noth. She is Teresa Prado Noth. ls this only a mere coincidence? -Am l being questioned here? -No, it's not the case... So what is this? What are you accusing me of? l just want to know who she is. She has your name. The same name! Are you really Teresa Prado Noth? You are insane! What a crazy stoy! Of course l am Teresa! Any doubts? Enough, Artur! It's over. The corpse wasn't recognized. lt will be sent to the graveyard tomorrow morning. -But what about the file? -lt doesn't prove anything. This case ends here. Unclaimed corpse. That's it! Let's go, Fernanda. l don't like this place. What else do you want, Artur? Forget all this. lt's ourjob. They are all dead. We can't do anything about that. Life as a holid9. Afree body. l look at her, Helena, and it seems she will fall apart, disappeaF. Not even a name she... Life as a holid9. The freedom ofwalking around anywhere. With no identity. -Afree body. -Afree body.
