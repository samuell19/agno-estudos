Black Rose Is an Emblem of Sorrow Red Rose Is an Emblem of Love PART TWO After the mark those with weak nerves should not look at the screen. Now, kid, we must stand with our legs firm on the ground. We put them in width of our shoulders we breath deeply and we [cannot be pushed] on neither side. How it is said in little Russia: ????? Who were you yesterday? The same who you were the day before yesterday: nobody. Do you think i was somebody? Horseradish in a coat! Me and you were ordinary construction waste of history. Why have you fallen silent? Are you contemplating? I support that. Let's discuss further. Nowadays fate really pushes us to the centre of the field. There in the centre you can't clap with your ears. Uncle Kok, should i put teapot on? Go on. I had consultations. Everything without a twig. As the saying goes: crude file, some filing work and...dry sand paper. Attention here. I'm going deeper into subject. It's impossible to think of better circumstances. We have real, green money but not three ruble bills. Can you imagine it - joint cooperative. Rockfeller, Mitya. And uncle Kok. My feet hurts! And that's the very beginning of grandiose economic experiment. Brainy people are already squeezing out two and three grand. And it's all according to law. Question lies elsewhere - if there was something to squeeze them out of. Here me and you - no problem. Many started from nothing. There, nuclear physicists opened lavatory at the train station. Little things - ten kopeck; if you did big time - fifty. Now you can calculate what assets turnover they have. And that all happens in hygienic conditions just like in Amsterdam or Meeting-house. But let's not throw aside other possibilities just yet. The deal is complicated and isn't 100% safe. With proper development of events we, of course, can get there, spirit of Helsinki, bandore, but the best is approbated way. Hebrew line. Sure, we don't have direct connection with this question. Because of good dough one can become not only hebrew, but even eveneki, if needed. But one has to take caution. Just like on a minefield - you made mistake, i died. But to speak honestly, becoming hebrew in my old age doesn't really fall into my heart. Well, what's there? Five years learning language: size, price, shoes, i want to buy trousers and all that you have. But if you confused with some word, somehow incorrectly understood what they say, put the money in the wrong place: caught a fire and burned down. You're put on [social] benefit. And here i'm in eternal [social] benefit. And i can talk in my mouther-tongue. "Once in ice-cold winter time i came out of the wood..." I think that was in vain: it started to snow and air got colder. Give a light. What snow, Tolik? There hasn't been a old womans' summer yet. Old womans' summer was during old regime. With special order/ It's been long since called off. Come here! What? They, soviet deputies, put with a big...tool on your old womans' summer. I remember in '82 Lolik died. Snow just started to fall. We were then, in the nuthouse, given clean clothes. In head doctor's office a winter garden was arranged. And in that garden - telly. Tolik's lyrical offset. Nr. one. We were all brought together: the restless, the calm, neurasthenics nurses and doctors, also. We sit quietly. No one talked, no one laughed. And no one spat on TV, Although we could do so. What to expect form us? Psychos! When they started to lower the coffin, cannons went off. One first-rate kid from restless, he posed as Calligula stood up, went to telly without saying a word and without saying a word turned the volume down. It became quiet. Eerie. What are you doing, Zhora?, nurse on duty calmly asks. And he answers: There is booming troughout whole country, i want to know how is in our place. We have everybody at home. Bonjeur! Como ca va? Hello. Can i come in? Welcome. Do you still remember me? Of course, i do. How long haven't we seen each other? Two months and six days. Oh, yes, eight, nine weeks. Is there somebody in there? Uncle Kok, tutor, from Luberez. I need to talk to you tete-a-tete. Tet na tet? Perhaps, here. You understand, i can't [live] with my joskins anymore. You see, i've taken my things with me. Can i live here for a short while? Until I rent a room somewhere? Go on. Won't your luber be mad at you? What for? He ???? and that's the end of it. Uncle Kok! Uncle Kok, let's get acquainted. This is Alexandra. My pleasure. Plivakin, Nikolai. And that's my pleasure. She's our relative. What relative? Distant one. In the line of out-marriage relationships. From Kargopol. Whose out-marriage relationships? What out-marriage relationships? What's this nonsense? What do you understand in out-marriage relationship? Where's your report book? What's your mark in algebra? Where's your nature-observation notebook? I bought a cake. We'll drink tea in the evening. Hello, mutton-head! I hear mutton-head speak. What do you want? I need to talk to you. This is not a good time. Mitya's tutor is here. Leave him tutoring, we'll have a talk meanwhile. Stop blowing shit in my direction! Shameless person! Let's go, i'm asking you. I won't go anywhere. Then, excuse me, but i'll come in. Step aside! Hello, kid! How are you? Fine? This is her husband. We have a civil marriage. Does that bewilder you? Everything bewilders me. That's alright. That's normal state of soviet man. That'll pass. Mitya, won't you object if we talk on the roof? Go on. Sashenka, nothing serious has happened. That's just your follies. We'll be more careful. Lovka is my friend, first-rate doctor... He'll do everything fine... anesthetics, syringes, seperate ward. It takes just half a day. Don't you want at all? What? Children? I want everything to be normal, but you...children. While this piggy is in Green Horn, i'm in pocket of his tailcoat. Have you seen him wearing a tailcoat? No, you'd go blind because of exaltation. I'm already gone blind because of exaltation. Look. Well, well, well, well, well... I knew it would end like this. Young man, open, please. That's for you. Why aren't you opening, motherfu... Oh, who is this? One, two, three, four... Hello once more. Take a seat. Sasha... Don't be shy, for Christ's sake. Mitya, pardon me, please, but this is my mom and this is my father. Things won't go like this, kids. It smells like a jail. Either documents on the table, or i'm calling the police. One, two, three... Calm, calm... Let me! Allow me. Tell me how are you planning to act regarding my daughter? And how do you want me to act regarding your daughter? Young man, can you come here for a minute? Am i needed? No, thanks. You're Vladimir? You're engaged in demonstration of clothe models? Take off your glasses, please. Why? I want to see what colour your eyes are. Here you go. Light brown. Yes, indeed. Light brown. Bravo, maestro! And that's for "mutton-head", Vova. Stand up, let's go where there is more light. You're saying - light brown eyes? This is for "tainted eggs". What have you in here? Kitchen? Vova, let's go... You hit like professional. Have you practiced? Eight years, first class. There's an impression you're a master. One can also take him by ears and on the knee. What's there? I think an ambush. Hand here a bucket, please. Here you go. Thanks. Tooth. You'll put new one in. That's very bad that there's no sexual education on our schools. Nobody wants and can use protective means. Blood... Water! END OF PART TWO EMBLEM PART THREE People with weak nerves, plese, don't worry - it's short. TRANSLATION: Whole part is performed with fully pressed sustaining pedal. So, what has come out here? Why [hit] in the face? That's with what i work. Go away, faschist. Do you mind if I smoke? Do you like it? Was this what you wanted? I have to be in London in two days. Madam Thatcher is to come the show. And she will have something to look at. She hasn't seen anything like this yet. Is it alright if I smoke? Tell me, how do you plan to act regarding my daughter? I'm asking you how are you gonna upbring my grandson? Or granddaughter. No, grandson. Girls are less happy. Is it possible to upbring children with such face? Who pulled you by the tongue? I'm asking her. How is she planning to defend honour of my daughters. Did I conceal them from her? Girls, one better than other. Honour pupils. Son of a bitch. Haven't I hit you enough, son of a bitch! I'm asking you to watch your language. There are children present. To watch my language! Yes, i'm asking you. There's children present! Don't hit my face, that's what i work with. Oh, you're working! But in the balls? Meanwhile in the south... All aboard! Ship of degenerates, where is your helm and steel-rope? I'm so afraid to fall in the seawater. Ship of degenerates, what have you in store for me? Death in the sea-waves of freedom? Russians don't give up. Evribadi Bang! What Did it hurt? Ship of degenerates, where is your helm and steel-rope? I'm so afraid to fall in the seawater. Meanwhile in the south.... Ship of degenerates, what have you in store for me? Death in the sea-waves of freedom? Russians don't give up. Faschist, receive a grenade from soviet soldier! Oh, who's this? Why are you shouting? Why did you hit him? What do you need form him? What documents? Why aren't you telling the truth? Afraid? That's my child she's gonna have. Pukerev. "Uneven marriage" Oil on canvas. Beginning of the century. What? What nonsense is he talking? Give her dimedrol, for christ's sake. Open your mouth! What will be with me now? She needs to take as much liquid as possible. Clyster would be very good. Do you have a clyster? I want to see just one normal man. Man...[that's what] i want to see. Explain yourself, Alexandra. I'll explain. She was ashamed. I invented to lay the blame on Vladimir. When i saw his humane drama with my own eyes i realized: my duty is to marry your daughter. Don't make such big eyes. Don't open your mouths. I've thought about [my] age, too. In exceptional cases when it's impossible to terminate pregnancy, such marriage is allowed with special permission. Our pregnancy is impossible to terminate. There was analogic case on seventh grade. Girl had twins. Her husband from ninth grade when they went to registry office said: one of them is not mine, we did it only once. But that's just details. I'll call the doctor now. Boy is undoubtedly out of his senses. You drove him this far. I'm officialy asking her hand. Alexandra, explain what's going on. Does anybody know how to call children's ambulance? Alexandra, perhaps, you are really going to marry the boy? I am. It is needed to call psychiatric ambulance. There exists such. On what resources are you going to build your family? Money. There is much money. I have 1 700 000 $. That's after paying taxes. Well, part of it needs to be converted to cheques, but i think it can be converted to rubles, too. Allow me to ask, where from? Grandfather died in France. Inheritance. He had a factory. Don't listen to him. Boy is, do doubt... There is inheritance. But i'm administering it, i'm [his] tutor. Don't pull wool over my eyes! I'm lawer by my education and i studied very well. The moment marriage is registered, tutelage is terminated. And administration of inheritance devolves to heir apparent. High class! That's dimedrol. Alexandra, help, please. Take mother's legs. After spending half a month in the nuthouse Tolik accidentally met Alexandra's mother. She introduced herself as closet friend of madame Thatcher to whom Elizabeth, queen of England, expressed surprise that Vladimir somewhat long doesn't go to them to England with model show. In general she talked about Vladimir with warm tenderness, she didn't mention her daughter at all. What's that song, Tolik? Russo-abessinian song for goners. It's sung in goner's language. Everybody is waiting for newcomers, but that's not right. Actually, they already were. They came, looked at us and left. Can I ask him for a minute? Let's go. They all have dark glasses, did you see? So what? I have glasses, too. Take them off. Satan! What? Are you baptized? No. That's not good. You need to be baptized. I'll be your godfather. But godmother? Alright, I'll bring her. I know one very good woman. She lives in ??? Nontheless, your algebra worries me. I'll come by later, check your report-book. Alright. And notebook in nature-observing. Don't worry, uncle, go home. I love you. Have a good sleep and don't think of anything bad. I won't offend you. How do you think, will we have a fictive marriage? Or do you really offer me your hand and heart? Trembling young hand and young loving heart? Will we have sex live after registration? Or friendship? Doesn't that bewilder you that you're not taking me as a girl? I'm no virgin, Mitya. I somwhere read such babbling. Yes, Dostoyevski. There Nastasya Filipovna was saved by exactly the same idiot. And there's wild women fidgeting around the plotline. Terrible vapidity. That Dostoyevski was natural scribble. We will have soulful marriage, won't we? And no impudency. And no rock. Just classics, classics. You see, i'll die without classics. Me and you are two halves now. I thought you were my half but you turned out to be cold as ice. You're good, noble kid. Did you turn off blinking so that I wouldn't go crazy? Anyway, if you'll stalk me before registration I'll expel you from pioneers. Mark my words. END OF PART THREE In this place was supposed to be episode "Death of grandfather in France" but because of refusal by general board "Mosfilm" and Goskino USSR to give us some francs - grandfather dies behind the scenes. Viewer! Brace your imagination and picture this bitter scene without our help and without any francs by yourself! God's kingdom to grandfather! Amen! Black rose is the emblem of sorrow, Red rose is the emblem of love. LAST PART Viewer! What's good in home? Sit and watch. Medical conclusion of illness and death of Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin. On night to march 2 Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin had hemorrage in left hemisphere of brain because of hypertension and arteriosclerosis. As a result paralysis of right-side of the body and loss of reason occured. During first day of illness respiratory disturbances as a result of breakdown of nervous' centres were discovered. These disturbances grew graver from day to day. They had character of periodic breathing with long gaps, [Chain-Stox breathing]. In night to march 3 respiratory disturbances began to have threatening character. From the very beginning of illness disturbances of circulatory system were discovered, "Tolik's Terrible dream No. 18 369/024" high blood preasure and pulse rate disorder, arrhythmia and heart dilatation, to be exact. In relation.....circulatory system........ signs of oxygen........ From first day of illness [his body] temperature rose and high leucocytosis set in what could indicate a lung infection. Tolik's Introduction. Day three. Friends, let us all die why should we need life's trembling? grave's rattle is better and death's black swimming-pool. Friends, let us live and crush slimy butterfies... Let's hit all the rest in the mug because life and death - that's all the same. Marchober 15, 1985. Look, dumb-head, your telly picks up ten channels now but ??? is on the seventeenth. Discrepancy! What will be now? Will he start ploughin? Ah, hell knows! He should start ploughing like Papa Carlo. Oh, suit - wonderful, just like sewn specially for you. That's like exactly for going to grave and not to psychiatrist. Maltese, 320 cheques. That is, hundred dollars. Buck, they say, goes one for twenty. And so your suit, Tolik, comes close to two hundred. Isn't that too expensive for grave? That's nuthouse arithmetics. "Izvestie" writes that one dollar is sixty kopeck. They have such exchange rate in editorial office: dollar for sixty kopeck. Or they print that for nuthouse, but I'm telling you the price for life. Price for life in USSR. So, we'll stick this hose here but what next? Then we'll stick this hose there. How is it tured on, anyway? Water comes into drum. He, drabadan! Oh, turbine! Checkup of apparatus. Not a shit comes in here. Stand up, dear, stand up. Open your mouth. And one, and two, and three, and four. Deep breath. I'm thankful, Mitya, for everything. I'm thankful to you as a man. You saved me, you saved her and you saved the little one. You saved us all. Does this lid open? Oh, Vova, me and Mitya, too, are thankful to you. If it weren't for you, maybe me and him would never have gotten acquainted. Why did I crawl in here? To call you. Hello to tainted eggs from fresh ones! Shut up, degenerate! With this all started for us. What started? That what you see today. You'll live with Sasha's grandmother for now. How is she? From hospital to sanatorium, from sanatorium to hospital. But her parents doesn't let us there. You saw them. But you don't even have to ask, climb up the stairs, stay for the night, climb down. Keep on pedaling and you'll be just as strong and beautiful as I am. Vova, are you on wheels or are they taken away because of bad behaviour? Sashenyka, you wanted to go for a ride? I wanted you to get on wheels and go there, you know where. Where? There, Vovochka, there. That's rough, but I forgive you, because you're in so interesting state. I'll stay nevertheless, alright? No, not alright, last time Plevakin told you to bring documents. Did you bring them? What's written there? Who's your wife? Who's your kids? Where are you registered? But he has a document that she is his wife and they are going to have a baby and I myself am a witness and my signature is in this book. And why did you drag yourself here? Are you thrown out of home? Come to me and sleep on the floor. Let's go and get the machine ready. I think you stuck the hose right previous time. Have you really been registered? Yes. And he really has a million? Two. Rings one time, that's for me. Probaby, form nuthouse. Good day. Good day. I don't know whom to adress but i'm looking for Vladimir. Come in. Take off your coat. Where do you tell me to go? Good day. Vovik, have pity on me. And you, please, have pity on me, too. Things went head over heels. I know I am to blame, I don't feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry for girls, wife, daughter, granddaughters. I'm wearing uniform deliberately. Vovik, I'm ceremonially asking you come back, have respect for my foolish bald head, have respect for, though funny, but orders. Comrade, don't worry, better drink some juice. But I'm ceremonially answering you. For how many years you, beast, had your hand on my throat? I kissed your daughter? Marry her! Married - get kids! Got one - get another! So that grip was stronger. But ??? What? I say: but feelings? What feelings? These feelings got blown out throuh my ears long ago. He has connections in KGB he's pulling me by the strings. Says: dance! And i dance, i dance. Says: I'm tired, and i lay to sleep. If he wants, he can get you to Sheremetyevo-2 through diplomatic channels without inspection If he doesn't want - he'll put you in construction works in Mukhosransk. Is he too weak for Mukhosransk? After baobabs? There's nobody to work in Mukhosransk, there's five men on each palm-tree. Why don't you say something? That's my husband - eaten too much pears. Tell him to get lost. Why are you keeping silent? Is it alright if I smoke? Bad, very bad, that's bad for me. I'd say that you yourself don't want me to get lost. With child's mouth speaks she knows what. By god, I'll call daddy. That's right, old pal, it's time to become a man. Leave us for a moment. Should I leave? Why are you asking me? You have to decide yourself to leave us or not. You have to raise your voice at me so that I felt cold. Understand, fool, I ought to be afraid of you. I don't want. What are you mumbling, what don't you want? That somebody was because of something afraid of somebody. I'm working man, what has Mukhosransk to do with this? I'm from such mukhosransk myself, no matter what he imagines. All my life...with my hump... I'm brought forward... Stop it, daddy, stop shouting. We know your Vovik well, he's a bitch. You're brought forward, i'm brought backward, what's the difference? I'm asking you, daddy, stop it. I can't stand men crying. Kolya! Sasha, my girl, you do love me? You will always love me, you told me so, right? We'll have the baby, we will be three, you, me and him. No, Volodya, you're mistaken. It's too late. What are you saying? He's just a kid. No, it just seems so. Go away, Volodya. I won't go anywhere. You're lying, lying to yourself, lying to me. No. No. Don't. I can't stand men crying. My heart freezes from that, daddy. I can't. I have invalidity. Stop it. Kolya, let's get him to my room. Come on, dear. Move your legs, one, two, one. More validol? Perhaps you'll have a glass? I have. Look, how much. I myself don't drink. I'm making is as a protest. Out of what? Out of protest. Perhaps, you'll drink out of protest? I will. Come on. Spit on all this deal, daddy. Put on, so to say, with a tool. Don't let this thought get to your mind. Good. I'd put on with a tool but indifference, you understand, and loneloness is killing me. Drink it up, daddy. Understand, everybody has gone away, there's no one here. Earlier phone couldn't stop ringing, people stood in crowds, everybody needed me. This for one, that for other, but now everybody is like a rat. Don't you have any friends at all? Hell knows, looks like no friends. No, wait, there is. There is one but he's a negro. That's not it, daddy. No, he was leader of progressive movement. Though, his movement was found out by some interesting place. Where is he now? In Moscow. We were both thrown out of there. Let's call him. I have a phone. Smolniy or Kermlin? What language? Goner's. OK, goner's. Give a drink! Come on, come on! Not from heaven falls into mouth, by damn mother! ...throat suffocating...imperialissmus! ????? It's impossible to be in two county-fairs with one ass! General crysis, no money! Burning heat and people are waking up. Perestroika, road needs to be cleared! He died for life progressivus. One envoy is no big deal, to hell with hundred envoys! Mitya! What? Come down! Why? Come down, Tolik... What? Understand, there's something wrong with Tolik. Suddenly lied on his back. Nevertheless, he's some idiot. Found a time for jokes. Wassup, guys? Tolik! What's with you, Tolik? Enough, time to leave. Silence. There's completely obscure situation in our state. Do you understand russian? Very badly. It's time to leave! And you, too, get slowly away from here. This one is deceased's, this one's mine. Wash the rest and put away. You, too, should go, uncle. I'll manage myself. Anatoliy Feoktistovich Gnilyuga, born on March 5, 1953, in villiage Bolshye Obsery of Krasnogvardeyskiy district, Lenin province was mourned in temple of Orthodox Church in Vaganykov cemetary and buried in tomb of grand duchess Elizaveta Andreevna Lobanova-Rtishceva by agreement of her son Dmitriy. Sweet sleep, Tolik, let native land be like feather bed to you!... EPILOGUE I tought him. But why in the home? I never thought you can do such thing at home. He's afraid to be denounced.

Here we see folk which is taught by John about penance so that they would step into waters of Jordan to be baptized. And they step into water and John baptizes them. In the time when John was baptizing people in Jordan Jesus came to the river. Sasha, help me, please. Take the kettle, You'll have to undress, leaving your underwear on. Is this enough water? Enough.
