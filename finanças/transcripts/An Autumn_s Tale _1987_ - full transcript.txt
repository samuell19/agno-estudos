Jennifer. Why bring so many of Vincent's pictures? You'll be with him everyday over there in school. Mammy, put Vincent's mitt in my luggage too. Thank you! Fatty! Should I bring him this one... Or this one? Neither! He won't even pick you up at the airport. He has to play a match in Boston! Always thinking of Vincent! Now don't forget your cousin's picture. It took me a while to persuade him to pick you up. He even found you an apartment. What a jerk! Jerk? He's a community leader in Chinatown. Owns a house and car, and lives like a king. He worked on ships. People called him Sampan. What a weird name. He must be quite somebody to be called that. Here, that this barbecued duck with you. Nobody carries a duck onto the plane! Take it! It's a 20-hour flight. Ladies and gentlemen this is Captain Nelson speaking. We'll soon be landed in New York Kennedy Airport. We would like to thank you for flying with us. And hope that your staying in New York will be a pleasant one. The temperature in New York City is 75. The local time is 4:30 p.m. Thank you for flying with us. Thanks a lot. You guys are so nice. Jennifer! Who's this Jennifer? Who cares? Just pick her up. Jennifer... Damn it. Sorry. Jennifer... Jennifer... I'm Jennifer! - You are Jennifer? - Quiet. Right, you're Sampan? You are my 4th aunt's 13th niece? O.K. Go get the luggage. Get on the car. Hot water! Hot water! Sayonara! Aligato! Sayonara! Hurry! - Give it to me. - Thank you...They're your friends? He is called Saucer Plate. He always asks people to do him a favour He is called Bull. He doesn't admit his own fault. So your name is the most interesting. Of course. Why are you called Sampan? A sampan drifts around. And will sink any minute. Get your ass in! The door ain't working. Just keep your hand on it. Is it safe? You bet! With me at the wheel, it's smooth and safe. You son of the bitch. You're gonna study here, Sis 1 3? Excuse me? How much you got out of Atlantic City just now? About $3,000. - Touch me $1,000. - Again? - What do you study? - Acting. - Goddamn Mexicans! - What you rushing to hell for!? Let me show you something. Chase them. If I am not able to follow you, I will not be called Sampan. Damn it... Chase them. - Damn... - Come on. If you want to die, just do it. Who are you? Don't be too boastful. Chase them. Excellent. They don't understand a word you said? They don't have to, as long as I'm happy. Yeah, who cares? Little bastards! How dare they tease me! Yeah. Go away. I don't have money. Go... What's the matter with you. Go. No sweat! You take care of them. Quick! Move your ass! Ok, goodbye. We'll try our luck again tonight at the gambling den. - Good. - Goodbye. See ya tonight! Get in! This is it? Right on! Nice, huh? Come in. - Hi - Back from work? Yes. $300 a month, all inclusive. Maintenance, security, everything. There's the pay-phone at the stairwell. Gas and electricity on your own. Here, this fridge is run by gas. Run by gas? You'd better watch out and keep it properly shut all times. I live downstairs. If you have problems, just hit the floor. You wanna pull down the house!? - Morning. - What's the matter? I'm sorry... Get to the point! My boyfriend is returning from Boston today. I want to meet him at the station. How can I get to the train station? New York subway is a labyrinth. People ain't no angels. It's dangerous for a girl like you. Yeah, very dangerous. Right, very dangerous. O.K. I'll go get changed. Be right back. Women are chable! What'd you say? Chable? Nuisance! Trouble! Don't you understand English? No one ever came to meet me in my 10 years. Vincent doesn't expect me here either. How long it's gonna take? 15 minutes. If you say 15, it's 30. I ain't wrong to take it for 60, eh? How do I look? Give me a grade. A plus. Hey, wait for me. Come on. What do you think of the game? Well, I think the first round is the best. - What about me? - Well... Jennifer... Jennifer! Stop it! This is embarrassing in front of people. I don't care! Nobody knows me here! Here are the clay dolls you asked me to make! Now don't act like a child. It took me 2 months to put them together Don't you want them? Now that you're here, have you got a place to stay? None of your business! What do you care... When I came or when I'll go! Calm down! Over here girls are liberal-minded! It's just like saying "Hi"! Saying "Hi"!? That simple? What a party! Who is she? Go ahead, tell her! Peggy, this is Jennifer from Hong Kong. Hi! I won't say "Hi" to her! Jennifer! Let's go! Move it! Hello! Hang on! Call for you. Leave me alone! Might as well give him a good scolding! No! No! She won't answer your call. We'll talk in the afternoon. Bye. He dates you to talk about you too. No! Lost again yesterday, dammit. Excuse me! So? Well, now that you're here, you should widen your horizon, and experience different lifestyles. You mean get to know more girls? Don't be childish. You should open up yourself. It took me 2 years to save up enough money to come study with you. I've always encouraged you to get more study. But, not necessarily with me. What's more, I'm planning to transfer to Boston, I'm leaving tomorrow. With that girl? Mind your feet! I'll see. Tell me now. Do you prefer her to me? You shouldn't tag along all the time. It won't help you grow. Don't talk like you're doing this for me Just say you want to leave. Don't be like that. Remember what Woody Allen said? A relationship is like a shark. It has to move constantly. Or it dies. Did Allen Tam the singer say that? He only said, "What a trap! And why me! Why me!" Bullshit! Sis 13! - Gas leakage - What's the matter? Call the Fire Department! Call the Fire Department! Quick! Sis 13, you alright? You alright? Sis 13? Sis 13! Don't push it, stand behind the line. - Where's the leak? - There... Goddammit! Go! Go! Are you alright? I don't know. He hung up. - The phone didn't even ring. - Well. Wanna go for a walk? Pan, how about taking me to Boston. No, you ain't going, dammit! You're here to study. Make good use of your time to learn! Forget about that jerk! He don't care for you! Who says he doesn't care for me!? It's obvious, come on! Look at yourself! You're a mess! Crying your eyes out, tearing yourself apart. You only make yourself cheap! Pan...I'm already 23. Fantastic! The prime of your life! I'm 33 already. A 23-year-old woman is older than a 33-year-old man. You're going crazy! Let's get back home. Mammy, I've been here for a week now. Sampan has found me a nice apartment. Cosy and spacious. New York is beautiful. Vincent and I will go see a musical next week. Don't worry about money. I've enough. Don't send me anymore. Save it for yourself. What do you want? Egg sandwich. How many eggs? How much are they? 60 cents for 2 eggs; 50 cents for 1. 1 egg. Sandwich! Single egg! Hey, Pan! Hello, animals! Have you won last night? A little bit. Sis 13!

Winter melon. Get me 2. Extra melon! No charge! OK? - O.K. Anything you say. - Quick! Didn't see you a couple of days? School just started. Good! Washington said, "A good start is half way to success!" Did Washington say that? If not Washington, then must be Confucius. Either one! Here, Pap, special for you. Dig in! Can't study with an empty stomach! Delicious. Eating is important for all people. Just relax. Relax is very important. You should enjoy eating. You ain't got too many lives to live! Say, Pan, where can I buy a bookshelf? Buy? I'll build one for you. Good! Someday when you're free... A real man doesn't say someday. He says today. Let's go after this! Bath-tub! Desk! Too bad that window is blocked off, or we can see Brooklyn Bridge. It took me 3 days to paint this window. You dig? - I dig! Soda? - Good. Study hard from now on. Don't let people look down on you. What else can I do now that I'm here. - Nice watch! - My grandpa gave it to me. Only the watch band is too worn-out. What a pity! Get another one. I don't even have money for my tuition! I found a part-time job. Babysitter. How much? Enough for rent. I need another job for the rest. Then I can rest assured and really study. Smart girl! Some ambition! There might even be money left for a Broadway show. Yankee opera!? They're disgusting! Shall we dance...? Excuse me. Sir, there's the line. You are such bad. Sis 13! Here come your Broadway tickets! What'd you say? Something for you. Doing your own cooking, eh? This is for you. Why such a hurry? Running out of time. I start babysitting tonight. All the way out to Long lsland. Right. Nice area. Girls like you should be with good family. Ain't no good to be with scums like me. Going tonight? Yeah, right now. What'd you say just now about Broadway tickets? You got tickets for me? Hell! Yankee opera is disgusting. lt'll taste better if you think of it as fried cookies. Close the door for me, please. Bye. I am not "yellow cow". What are you talking about? I am waiting for my girlfriend. You can talk, but I can't talk. I don't know what you are talking about? You are right and I am wrong! - Pan! - Right on! Sis 13, this dumb cop don't even understand English! I am not "yellow cow". I don't understand you either. I am not "yellow cow". - Are you his friend? - Yeah... These tickets...one for me, and one for him...l mean it's ours. Alright...just take off. - Understand? I am not "yellow cow". - Go. Damn it. Stupid cop! I ain't no scalper! I ain't got nothing on me, but I got my dignity. You bought those tickets for me? Of course not. They're Bull's. Ain't you gonna babysit? Oh no, I'm late. Where to? Let me drive you there. That junk? I'm too tired today to hold on to the door. It's a new one! So this is your new car! You can hear every part except the horn. I had a rough night. Stripped down to the last penny! But this is a good car. and a convertible, too. Look at this hole. I'd better watch my feet! Why don't you quit gambling? I need it to balance my mind! Come on, we're gonna be late. We"ll wait for another five minutes, ok? I am late. I got to go. Ok, I'll wait for you. Sorry, Mrs. Sherwood. Didn't we say 6:30? Next time, I'll be... You'd better. Time is important to me. Well, I'll wait for you in the car. My daughter's in there. Go in and introduce yourself. I am in a hurry. Don't have time to introduce. Bye bye. Why don't you go in? Well? Get in... Hi... Pan, come in and stay with me for a while. It's just a little girl. Please. Women are "chable". - Hi, Anna have you eaten? - Yup! Let me introduce this big fellow here-Uncle Pan. Hi. - He is called Uncle Pam? - Yes. I want some grapes. O.K. Aren't you going to peel them for me? Nobody peels grapes. You just spit it out afterwards. All my babysitters peeled them for me. Shame on you! You're a big girl now, you know. Watch me. See how I eat melon seeds. How's that? You had the melon seeds in there first. Open your mouth. You have bad breath. Your mouth is smelly. You can't tease her anymore. If you don't behave, I'll beat you up! Understand? Stretch...open eyes, mouth, everything tighten hard...let go...that's it Lost again! Let's split! - Where's my dishes? - Wait a minute. I got to quit gambling! Touch me $100! Get to quit! Got a cigarette? I want to start saving and open a restaurant. Nuts! Money is to use, not to save! I'll spend my last penny the day I croak Hi, Pan! Snack for you. Do you remember that mother? Thanks Sure, the one with 200 boyfriends. One of her boyfriends, a dirty old man... will hire me as a receptionist in his restaurant. Oh, yeah? You'd better be careful. I'll be fine. You want me to check him out? No need, really. But come and see me at the restaurant. Ain't got no time. Here, for you. How ugly. Who's this? Guess. Such an ugly face. Must be me. You're not so ugly. If you shave, you chin looks like Richard Gere's. Really? Yeah, it looks like his knee! I was a student once. Went through a lot! Be a good girl and I'll raise your pay. O.K.? But you said you got no time. I happened to pass by. This is Tony, our Manager. This is Pan. - This way. - Ok. That's the dirty old man. I can see that. Make yourself comfortable. What do you suggest? How about fried rice? That sounds wonderful. I'll have that. Sir, from our boss with honor. What is this? Fin de Siecle! Thanks. - Sir, would you like to order now? - Sure. - I'll leave it up to you. Simple. - Sure. Sir, how do you like these dishes. Good! Simple and good! Getting late, huh? Thank you.

Mum's still at the beauty salon. Can't I come in and wait? Jennifer. Can't I say hello to Jennifer? Don't kiss me. Your beard hurts me! - Let's go out to the garden. - O.K. Make yourself at home.

Have you been to Lincoln Center! Here comes mammy! Anna, have you been a good girl today? Yeah! I've been very good today. Peter did a good job on your hair today. Jennifer, come here for a second. What is it? Well, Anna's big now. I'm thinking of sending her to boarding school. After she's gone, there's nothing much to do here. I understand. Then we'll start tomorrow, O.K.? Still, I'll pay you for this week. It's not necessary. I'm leaving now. Jenny, where are you going? Mammy, where is she going? Jenny said you were a bad girl. She won't look after you. You're lying. I was very good. Jenny was bad, then. Jenny was good too. Jenny... What's going on? Who's bad? You. What'd you say? Forget it. Where're we going tonight? Thank you. Please come again. Thanks...bye. That's the dirty old man who blew Sis 13's job! Son of bitch! Take this! And this! And this! Stop it... Take this! And this! You are just like rubbish. Stop it... Stop it! Pan, stop it! Now what have I done? It was no big deal. Don't get smart now! Are you alright? Pick up the board! Don't bother! Please go! What do you mean? Well, you need not come back to work. Say it again. Pan! - O.K. Where's my pay? - What? Give it to her, dammit! OK, you win. Let's split. I'm O.K. Let's go. It's me, Jennifer. Anna, why haven't you gone to bed? I can't sleep. There's ghost in the house. Nonsense! Where's mammy? She had a big fight with Uncle Tony, and she went out. Jenny, I'm scared. Silly girl. Go to bed now. Jenny, please sing me a song. Alright. "ln the forest and meadow far far away." "My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?" "While birds are chirping and dancing happily." "My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?" "ln the forest and meadow far far away." "My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?" "While birds are chirping and dancing happily." "My dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?" We won't die easily. See, your clay dolls can keep you alive. All yours. - Let's go eat pizza. - OK. It's from foreign country, how good is that? Wait. Wait, let me take a look. Hello - Please! - May I help you? - May I have a look at this? - Sure Take this for me, please. Quite good looking. Matches my watch perfectly. Right. Go ahead and buy it. How much? No, thanks. That's alright. Bye! How can a watchband be so goddamn expensive? Goddamn expensive! I heard that from Temple Street. Sometimes heard that from funeral parlour. Let's go, Pan. Why should we? I don't want to see him. Let's go! Come on! Pan, how do I look today? What grade? D minus. Be serious. How do I compare with her? Who's her? You know, her. The one with Vincent. Which one of us looks better? How should I know? Go ask Vincent. Why are you so touchy? I know I'm not as pretty. Always worrying about looks. It's ain't everything. You bet it is to Vincent. He prefers her because she a pretty. What do you care? You dumped him! You dumped the past! Look at your cross face. You're the ugliest on this street! You don't have to be so mean when I'm sad. Sad!? Because you ain't pretty? How about me then? Kill myself? Your mum really spoiled you rotten! What about you? Gambling 24 hours. Pot calling kettle black? Who the hell are you anyway? OK! I ain't nobody. I will ignore you from now on. You ain't "chable" me no more. I ain't got nothing on me, but I got my dignity. The one who lose paid for that. Pan. Here, for luck! Pan, spare me $2,000. What for? Just give it to me. Add $100... What you need it for? Forget it. - That restaurant again? - Yes. What's going on? That assholes, they get four hundred dollars each week. Still not enough. Last week I was tight... and they smashed my front window yesterday. Fuck it! Go get them! Or I'm not called Pan! Wait! Where you gonna find those assholes at this hour? Forget it, Pan. If I can help it... I ain't want to fight to hurt my business. They'd better not stop on us again! If they do, you let me know and I'll smash them! Get ya! One and four. Three's the winner! That's it for today. Let's split. "Want to eat?" Come in. Dinner's ready. Try my cooking. Have some fish soup. - It's awful! - Really? To make fish soup, you must add in orange peel! Also, you should use ripe potatoes and you shouldn't put salt in too early. Or the fish wouldn't be tender. - Did you use refined salt? - Yes. Big mistake! You must use natural salt, and you mustn't stand too far or too close. You must be 2 feet away from the pot. - 2 feet? - Yes. Right? You don't understand? O.K. Let's me tell you. Sit down and listen. If you're too far, it's too bland; too close, it's too salty. I see. Good. Go ahead. It will be a fine day tomorrow. How do you know? Your rheumatism doesn't hurt? In Oct. If the evening wind is southerly... the following day will be a fine day. Really? No bullshit? Always trust a sailor. Likewise, when lightning takes place, notice its direction. North means gust; east means rain. South means wind; west means sunshine. That's what you learned during sailing. What else was there? All you saw everyday was the sea and several seagulls. I heard that every seagull is a dead sailor's soul returning to visit its former friends and homeland. See those fishing over there! They're your sailing friends. Shut your dirty mouth! Even if I were dead, I wouldn't want to be a seagull. Flying all day long is tiring. When I'm dead, I want to just lie there. Flying is great. I want to see more places. Once I was afraid to travel, but no anymore. I want to see the world. Don't you? I've been everywhere in this world. I don't want to go anywhere. What do you want? I hope that one day I can open a restaurant. Right here facing the Atlantic Ocean. Every night after work, I can sit by the door, enjoy the breeze drink some beer... And play polka? No. No need to balance my mind if I'm my own boss. - Not even if your friends ask you to? - No more gambles. And by then my friends will all be gone. Maybe...you'll be gone too. Maybe I'll still be here. Then we can...watch the sea together. What will you call your restaurant? You got suggestions? Let me think. Didn't your teacher give you an English name? Yeah. Samuel Pang! Call it Sampan, then. Sampan? The boat? Right you are. Sounds good. Welcome to Sampan, table for two? Just a minute please. The ride was real fun. I'll paid for a ride when I have the money, okay? Let's drink, Let me sing you a song. "ln the forest and meadow far far away." "my dear friend, what oh what is on your mind?" "Sampan is singing, Sampan is dancing" My dear "Chable"...is that how it goes? You know this song, too? l...overheard you. I'm going downstairs. If you need me for anything... Step on the floor. OK? I'm going. Step on the floor. 3 Commandments: Out gambling, drinking and smoking! 5 Goals: Diligence is the key to success. Get the Green Card, then the Gold Card! Wear shoes, wear socks; speak grammatical English. You want it, go for it! Sampan wants "Chable", Sampan goes for "Chable"? Someone love"Chable"? Fatty: Since coming to America, everything has changed. Do you remember that Sampan? I think he's in love with me. I feel free when I'm with him. Yet somehow there's a kind of man. whom you'll love to be with, but to marry him is another thing. We belong to 2 different worlds. If we should part someday. I don't think either of us can take it. He's over 30, and this looks like his first love. I had a hard time getting over Vincent. You know that a relationship is exhausting. Red is good, goddammit. You know shit about color! White is pure! Now what should I choose: red or white? OK. Quick! Nothing. Just cleaning up the yard. Oh, we'll have a party here next week. You'll be free? Party? Of course. lnvite your friends too. All of them. Great! I'll do it now... What's the occasion? Do you need a reason to have fun? Yes. Clean the floor. Why ain't you tell her it's your birthday? Why tell her. Well, it's your birthday. You "um luen" her? What's that? You jerk! He says that you have a crush on her. I know I'm right. You " um leun" her. You're crazy! Now move your ass and work! You have to come that night. Don't ask me come and dance. I invite you. - Don't... - I will not come. Better go to the casino. That means you don't respect me. Don't touch. Hot water... Hi, please come in. Jenny, hi! Welcome. Let me... Please get the stick for me. Almost done? Thanks. Please get one chicken wing for me. Wait a second. Sorry. Pan, let's dance. Dance with your classmates. Come on. Some other day. A real man doesn't say someday. Yes. Jennifer, may l? Come on. The next one. Come on. The next one! Promise! The next one. - Do you like the food? - This is a good party. Can I have another ribs? Thanks. - What? - I understand. I heard you're throwing a party so I came to see you. Help yourself to the food. I made them. Try the fish soup. So you learned how to cook. Well, mom is not around. You remember that Portuguese restaurant? The one that makes very good seafood soup... And has a chunky Philipino singing. Three Coins in a Fountain... I remember, just like singing a love song. Right...Each one seeking happiness... How've you been? I broke up with Peggy. How're you doing? You...have a new boyfriend? I don't know. I know who he is. $600! All of it! Didn't you say you were having a party? It's over! Nineteen! Takes all! Game over. All cleaned out! No money, no worries. - Pan! - What's up? Pan, spare me another $2,000. What? Those assholes again? Bull, don't be afraid! It's the second time already! Assholes! Fuck it! Let's go get those bastards! Let's go! Smash them! Let's go get my car! Forget it, Pan. Forget it. Open the door! Wait... Quick! Open up! Bye! Good party. See you. Pan, where've you been? I was bored! I was unhappy! It's you who wanted to have the party? I've asked you to dance but you refused. Dance...? I dance like a crab! I sing like a crow! Where're you going? Nowhere! Whoever steps on us will get it! Get on the car. Sampan, you have a fight again? - You think it strange? - Yes. We're all experienced fighters. You fight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, then to New York. - We've seen it all! - Right! Pan, you've been drinking. Why, is there a law against drinking? Can I let my buddies down if they get me drinks? Dumb broad! Let's go! Don't go, Pan! Don't go! Sampan, where did you go? Jenny... Are you crazy? Damn it. See? You two don't get along? lgnore me. My name is Sampan, I'm 34 years old. I was born on 9th November,1952. 9th November? 9th November. Those assholes usually hang around here. Where the hell are they? Dammit! Where are they? It's them! - Really? - Yes Let' s go. - It's them -Yes. Fucking assholes! You suppress our compatriot Fight! Go to hell! Come on! Come on! How dare you! Go to hell, jerk! Good... fight!

Stay if you like, but don't say it's because of me. You decide the place that fits you the best. I thought about it clearly. New York fits me best. Today you say New York, tomorrow you'll say Boston. Anyway it doesn't matter. Your family is rich. I won't depend on my family anymore. Could you get me a job? You, work? You won't even get enough for your car. Besides, I won't be able to help you. I'm moving to Long lsland to stay with the family I babysit. You still mad at me? You know when I first got here, alone... I was confused and loose. Now I want to settle down. But I don't. I didn't sleep last night, thinking about you. Three people didn't sleep last night. Let me go and finish packing. Well, let me drive you to Long lsland. Alright, I'll go get the rest. Such a coincidence. I go there first. You don't live here, don't you? Yes, I live in long lsland. Long lsland, the view is very good. I give you the address, you can visit me anytime. Good, one day I'll visit you, Good, one day I'll visit you, Sis 13, for you. Thanks Why don't you tell me yesterday is your birthday? I can celebrate with you. As long as I'm happy, there is no need to tell anybody. Best wishes. I have a gift for you. Happy birthday. Thanks. Goodbye, best wishes. Anna, you like here or not? Yeah, let's spend our summer vacation here. OK? Sure, we could sit on the beach at night, I used to have a friend whose dream is just open a restaurant here, facing the Atlantic Ocean. And call the restaurant Sampan. Sampan? Yes, Sampan, Samuel Pan. Is it like the one over there? - I hope you enjoy the food - Thank you. You are welcome. Bye... Bye... Welcome to Sampan, table for two?
