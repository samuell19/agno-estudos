[Barack Obama speaking...] Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But its not. It takes commitment. And you experience plenty of failure along the way. So the real test is not whether you avoid this failure.. Because you won't. Its whether you let it harden you or shame you into inaction. Or whether instead you learn from it and choose to persevere. Well, I had just moved to Chicago. At the time Chicago was really divided. Harold Washington, a black mayor, had just been elected. The city, at least the city council, was divided along racial lines. And a lot of people felt as if this was the city that no longer worked. It'd been called the city that worked, but now things seemed full of gridlock and division and argument. Our entire sports experience in Chicago was, they were terrible. It was one failure after another. As a sports fan it was really forbidden because your season would end very prematurely. Our sports experience in Chicago was defined by The Cubs losing in 1969. If you were a cubs fan you would be mathematically eliminated from the pennant race. Sometimes AS early as late July. In 1967 the White Sox had to just be alive to cross the finish line, and they couldn't do it and lost to cinders and by the Blackhawks blowing a 2-nothing lead in game 7 at the Chicago stadium against Montreal... By the White Sox in '83 losing to the Orioles when they were in the playoffs. To be a Chicago fan was... you really had to struggle, you know? The White Sox won once in '59, The Blackhawks in '61, The Bears in '63 and then that was pretty much it. One embarrassing collapse after another of Chicago sports. The early 80s, even a little before that, the Bears just weren't relevant. Not nationally and I don't really even think locally. Even the diehards looked the other way. And those Bears... those Chicago football teams were often a bunch of jokes. They were a team in kind of a disarray. The late 60s weren't good, the 70s were kind of bad and they were coming into the 80s starting to build things. Well I mean, being a Cubs fan I'm very used to disappointment. [laughs] You felt like you wanted to deck somebody just because we got eliminated already. So you know, you follow 'em, you see who the new squad was, who the new coach was, and who the players were and you just hope for the best. When I came to town in '81 the bears were just coming out of another season that wasn't very good. You know, I came to Chicago in 1980. They were actually booing us. I said "Walter, aren't we the whole team?" And Walter said "Well, you know, this is what happens in Chicago when you don't win." They weren't winning. So everybody literally outside of Payton was not on an equal footing. The fans were booing and our coach got fired, and everybody hated us. Everybody had to earn their strides. And Ditka had only gotten here in '82 as the new head coach, so winning wasn't really happening in Chicago at that point. Well I got here in '82 we weren't very good. Thank God that was only a strike year that year... I only had to play 9 games. Our own fans would dump beers on your head. They were brutal. I mean, they would pour beer on us as we were going to the locker room. My first couple of years there they were brutal in the papers. You'd go to the restaurant, they were brutal. Well sure, the fans were unbelievable. There were as angry as The Bears football team. It's because we were bad. So we'd leave our helmets on. So then they built a canvas cover over the tunnel. And I remember walking from a game we lost... the fans lit the canvas tarp on fire, so that they then could throw things at our heads. You know, burn a hole. And so they then put a steel one up, and then you just hear stuff bouncing off of it. I couldn't look myself in the mirror and walk around, and be alright with being mediocre. That's who you're letting down. The old man you're gonna see in the mirror when its all said and done. What did you do? Guys that would say 'Oh I'd love to go back and play one more game, ' those were the guys that look in the mirror knowing they didn't do it right the first time. You'd come out of church in the state of grace, you'd had communion and The Bears were already down 13, 14 points, and you're like daamn! They lost in such dramatic fashion. Like, they were terrible! They were the worst team you've ever seen. God? Whats the deal. And it was '84, I think we lost to the 49ers in the championship game. On the plane trip back Dan Hampton walked up and down saying "this ain't gonna happen again." "We're not gonna lose like this again." How many years of failure? From 1963 to 1985. 22 years of failure in sports and this team exorcised all the demons. The fans, I think, for The Bears have always been the same - so passionate. Everybody in the city loves The Bears so the fans are very passionate but they were also starting to get a little jaded perhaps, thinking okay were tired of seeing all these other teams win. There were some good talent. Walter Payton was there. This guy was in place since the mid 70s and he was just a phenomenal player and people were recognizing that. And you thought, okay you got him, you got some other good draft picks, Jim Covert, Willie Gault... this seems like elite athletes. When I got here it was almost like The Bears were a second class citizen. Jim Finks who was the general manager at that time was putting up a plan together. Hampton came in, I came in in '80 and Mike Singletary, Keith Van Horne, Jim McMahon... they started putting this thing together. A lot of the guys that were coming in... we were winners. And we like winning, and we didn't wanna accept losing. [narrator] Neil Armstrong had taken on head coaching duties in 1978. Posting a win/loss tally of 30 and 34 after four seasons. After Armstrong led Chicago to a disappointing 6 and 10 record in 1981, Bears, Brass and fans alike hoped change at the top would be a catalyst for much needed progress. In the early days it was tough. I mean, getting up to come to work, there wasn't really nothing to come to. I mean, some guys literally had their truck or car packed at the last game in Soldier Stadium. [Bryan McKaskey] Coach Ditka was a special teams coach with the Dallas Cowboys at the time, and he wrote a handwritten letter to my grandfather and said, "I'd like to be the next head coach of the Chicago Bears." I thought really that I left here under not the best circumstances and kinna unfinished business... and thats what I told them in the letter. I said I wanna come back and I said I wanna coach The Bears. You'd be proud of what I do. You put Mike Ditka at the head of it. And its like oh boy if somebody can chorale all this energy and these different kinds of personalities, man you might have something just unbelievable. [narrator] In January of 1982, Mike Ditka became only the 10th head coach in Chicago Bears history. There was so much talent on the team, but sometimes talent collides unless it's coached with discipline. Mike Ditka was the 12th man on that team. I noticed an immediate change when coach Ditka came. [Steve McMichael] The practice... he came out as the head coach. You know what he told us after the practice was over? 'Boys I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is, give me 3 years, we're going to be in the Super Bowl. The only thing is... Half of you guys won't be there when we get there. Some of you guys in this room are not gonna be here. The bad news is half of you ain't gonna be here to see it.' They'd never heard that. They were playing football and my job was to win the Super Bowl. A lot of guys started looking around and... wow, that was a powerful day. And I remember that because I checked that roster, and boy, there were a lot of guys who heard that first speech and they weren't in the locker room down in New Orleans. I felt very good because I felt that okay there is a guy that sort of gets whats best about The Bears. I though to myself, 'I don't know coach Ditka, but I like him.' And I was very confident that he was going to make a difference. You only have one goal when you coach or you play, and that's to be the champion. To be the best you can be. And you can do that as a team. Its really a rewarding feeling. And when you can be the architect of that team that is even more significant than when I played. And you could just feel the vibe from 1982 on that we were gonna get going in the right direction. Guys started going in and out of that door real fast. He'd probably like nothing more than smashing you in the face and getting 4 yards. Thats who he was, thats how he coached, and it fit the personality of their talent all around the team so well. He was all pro and he came in as a rookie, so you thought okay here we go. Now we got a guy that's really that good but he was unusual and he had that single bar, you know, his first year as a Bear he broke some kind of record as it tied in. When you see the footage, you know, the famous footage of him just not getting knocked down - thats pretty much who he was. If you sit around and laugh and you worry about the people who resent what you're doing, you're not gonna do very much. Ditka was tough and you could tell that that toughness was what they needed. I say this all the time...'apologies to everybody I've offended. But hell thats too many people.' And we started acquiring the guys that really made a difference. The guys that wanted to win, wanted to do the extra work, wanted to be there, and wanted to be a part of something very special. And I think the '83 draft... if you look at the amount of guys that played and made an impact on the team, I think it was pretty good. Overall I think it was the '83 draft that kinda brought in the nuclear 17. Ditka was exactly what the doctor ordered. When Ditka showed up I was like okay he's sort of in the same through-line of talent and integrity and bareness as George Allen was, you know? He was like that. So it felt really good with Ditka right away. And he came and from day one he just said, 'guys, its gonna be blood, sweat and tears. Your blood, my tears, and its gonna be one way. Its gonna be my way.' [ominous music in background] [narrator] Buddy Ryan had long since won the respect and loyalty of his players. And While Ditka's arrival in Chicago brought new hope to Bears fans, with it came concern from the Bears defensive unit over their leader's future and the fate of what they had built together. When a coach comes in he brings in his own staff - offensively and defensively. So we got a petition together on the defensive end to keep Buddy Ryan in place. Back when Mike first got with us the defense had written a letter to coach Halas asking that they retain Buddy Ryan. He was their coach at the time. [narrator] George Papa Bear Halas, or 'Mr. Everything' as he was also known, was a player, coach, and the iconic owner of the Chicago Bears. He was a respected cofounder of the National Football League, and was swayed in 1982 to make a key decision for the Bears. So that was certainly an endorsement and I know my grandfather came out to address the team - which was very unusual. Everybody was going woooh... and we looked at the door and there's George Halas. Little George Halas in his overcoat. He came in and he went to the front of the room and Neil armstrong got out of the way and he said, 'can I have all the coaches leave the room.' And we were all like 'Holy shit. What's going on here?' And so the doors closed and he basically started talking and he pulled the letter out and said, 'you know, when I started this league 70 years ago I dreamed that it would be filled with men of integrity and vision... and I never thought that my team would be so worried and caught up with the goodness of the team to write a letter to demand that their coach be retained.' I mean, it was fantastic. And Halas came to Halas Hall and said yes, we'll keep him. So Mike had to accept Buddy Ryan. And he said I'm gonna sign Buddy to a new 3 year contract with all the assistants, and I want you to know that I'm proud of you as a team for what you've done. [Otis Wilson] I don't want to make it seem like it was two teams going on, but the offense was the offense. Buddy Ryan set the tone for everybody. Defensively we go on into the field and we stay there till Buddy is like 'hey, this is our game plan, and if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to be standing here on the sideline next to me.' Buddy was in the army in the Korean war... so you had to earn the respect of Buddy Ryan. "And if you're standing here too long, that little grocery bags job back there in Lake Forest grocery store... you're gonna have that job." After that, when you were part of the team - part of the defense - then he was very protective of his players. [coaches howling] [narrator] While Buddy Ryan fathered his players as if they were family, he also worked them relentlessly as any drill sergeant would their troops. [Dennis McKinnon] But there was fighting every single day. Offensive line, defensive line. Offensive period, you're supposed to let the offense do what they do and not really respond. The defense didn't go for that. They were bringing it in every play. So it was intense. Thats all we did was hit and do our practice. The first couple years, until he got the right people in place, a lot of hitting, a lot of sorting things out. [narrator] Chicago Bears practices meant running further and hitting harder than other NFL clubs of the time. There was no lollygagging around there was no ass-kissing, there was no brother-in-law as I used to call it in practice. When its my period you make me look good so when its your period i'll make you look good. That don't happen on Sunday during the game. So you better practice how the game is gonna be. And thats how you learned how the game is gonna go. I think there was a lot of animosity between Buddy and Mike because I think Buddy thought he was gonna get the head job. No, I never saw them go after each other although the sort of understanding was that they were two separate teams. It was like having two head coaches. Buddy was in charge of the defense and Ditka was in charge of the offense and sometimes they would cross on the field and wave each other. The Buddy Ryan - Mike Ditka conflict was a real one and a huge one. Its the best... Its the best story. Its almost Shakespearean. We don't agree on everything but hell I don't agree on everything with my wife either. Your offense and defense have to match. He don't have to listen but I tell him. You know what it is? It really is Jagger and Keith Richards... And they had the perfect head coach. He run the offense to fit defense and Mike Ditka was the guy that run that offense also. Ditka is Jagger. He's kind of the more vocal, the more famous, the more moody... [both laughing] - [Ike] Right? During practice he'd be yelling back and forth. I get along with everybody. As long as they do things my way. [laughter in background] We would sit there during the games and kind of laugh - because they'd be nose-to-nose yelling at each other. 'And we were like 'these are our two leaders?' and we're still winning. Buddy Ryan is Keith Richards. Hes the more nitty-gritty nuts and bolts designer of the group. Buddy Ryan had been grandfathered in. He came along with the team and he was a great defensive coordinator.' - [Bill Murray] They were both supremely confident in their own skin, you know. And they didn't need one more friend. They needed someone to run the defense and the offense and to run the show. You know, Buddy had certain privileges that most coaches wouldn't have. I don't think any of us would ever really know how Mike Ditka felt about Buddy or how Buddy felt about Mike Ditka. I think underneath it all they really respected each other and thats about all you could ask. Mike Ditka was the offensive guy and there were times where Buddy's team was so separate from Ditka's team that you might have as well had different uniforms for these guys. They might have as well been in different cities. If we didn't do something right or if somebody did something wrong, Ditka would come down there and say something to Buddy and Buddy was like "hell, well go score some points and leave me alone." "I'm in the heat of the battle right now" Buddy Ryan had 46 defense - something new, something creative, hard to understand, and then you put great talent with it...? Thats when you get total unbelievable production. [crowd cheering] The defense was even greater than anybody anticipated. I mean, maybe Buddy? Maybe they knew. But there's no way you could think that a team is going to literally make opposing players afraid. I guarantee you yo cant argue this fact... We were the defense that struck the most fear into the opposing team before the game had even started. And then we learnt really what the spark was among them. They were competing with one another - not the other team. It was Richard Dent competing with Otis Wilson They wanted to get there first and to get the cheers. Dean and Michaels normally got it started up... 'I got a 100 on the first one to get to the quarterback. [referee whistles] [groans on impact] 'That's all you got? That's all you got? Hey, I got 200' We wanted to take the quarterback out. I'm not supposed to say that, but that was our mission. I got 500! That's Ham... 'I have 500. What if I get two - thousand baby. Thousand!' You know, I'd sit at the meetings and they'd be talking about all this stuff but I just kept hearing this name - Richard Dent. All the time. And that was the main focus of our offensive line. And I said oh, I hear this Dent a lot... let's make sure to take care of Dent. [groans on impact] It got to the point where you could see quarterbacks that were terrified and you understood why they were terrified. They should've been. Dave Duerson used to come up from the safety position, get close to the center and bark like a dog at me as I was calling signals. They've always been like a defensive specialist team because when its cold weather you gotta smash the other guys, you know? Smashing the other guys keeps your blood flowing. And when you're outdoors it keeps your feet warm. Shame on the offensive coaches for telling them to make this little... pat the ball, drop back. You're gonna get annihilated. I mean he'd really go hur-hur-hur-hurh! That barking... [barking] The head-butting... It was insane. They were just crazy. They were so athletic - Wilber Marshal and Otis and Singletary... It was terrifying to another team. I wouldn't warm up with the team before the game, but when the teams go against each other run plays, I would go stand at the 50 yard line and stand there and just stare at the other team. That kinda explains all the things about their personalities. They got to a point where they were invincible. They were invincible. There wasn't any... We were dominant than anybody in NFL history. They were just about as good a defense than I'd ever played against - and maybe that ever played the game. I think every body knew and nobody even argued the fact that it was a unique scheme but the physical abilities of the players was unbelievable too. It was hard to focus on one particular guy because there were truly so many outstanding athletic people. The Bears have the best athletic defense of all time. No one could touch them. Every one on that team was an absolute beast. We had 3 all pros rushing and passing, we had 3 all pros line backers, and then we had a couple of all pros at safety. And then we had two very good corners. So what are you gonna do as an offense? Where are you gonna go? It's gonna be harder for the other team to beat you if they don't have the ball. So we had the ball a lot because our defense gave it to us... and then we kept it when we got it. I don't think they were cocky at all. I mean, they just get after the quarterback and put pressure on the quarterback, knock him down, take the ball away and that was their style of play. My guess is that we could probably control the football 35 minutes to 36/37 minutes a game. No one knew that Ron Rivera was a line backer back then because you had guys like Mike Singletary, and Otis Wilson, Richard Dent and Dan Hampton picking guys up and just tossing them aside. They were the best defense which made them a hard hitting team and our politics at that time as you remember - because of the city council wars, as we were known then if you go back to our politics - we were the Beirut-on-the-lake. And so here they are, hard hitting, just like our politics which were also capturing the nations attention at that time. You know when you have that many leaders on a football team sometimes its going to be fragmented. But it kinda unified the whole thing on the defensive side of the ball. When I came here the cabaret wasn't bare. Don't think the cabaret was bare at all. There were a lot of good football players on this team, and there were a lot of guys who didn't belong on this football team. And my job was to figure out who was who. So the one thing we didn't have after I found out after my first year of going 2, 3 or 4 quarterbacks - we needed a quarterback. [triumphant music] [narrator] Jim McMahon was not considered a prototypical NFL quarterback, free from BYU's restrictive culture Jim McMahon would immediately challenge the Bear bras and stretch the boundaries of player decorum. [Jim McMahon] I just remember sitting outside Halas' office waiting for hours... just sitting there. And I'd just flown for 3 hours and now I'm sitting in this guy's office for a couple of hours doing nothing and I finally ask the secretary what's going on. She said 'oh Mr. Halas is taking a nap'. So I said 'well wake him up.' I've got shit to do.' You know? With the NFL and rules he was kinda one of those anti-establishment type of guys. That first meeting with him wasn't all that fun. I just got drafted 3-4 hrs before that. He'd already had a contract for me saying this is the most we've offered a rookie, and this and that. He told me I was too short, I had a bad arm, couldn't see very well... that I should go to Canada. That was his words to me. I looked at it and just kinda watered up and I said 'I'm not signing this.' So I said 'why the hell did you even draft me then?' And I got up and walked out. You know a head band and advertising something... I think he was toying with the NFL and rules. And then I ended up signing that same little piece of paper that I wrinkled up and threw back at him so... Love him. He's crazy! Certainly he's crazy but I had a great relationship with him and he was very loyal to his teammates. McMahon, you know, a quarterback who looks like he came out of some teen movie. Like he's Sean Penn in Fast times at Ridgemont High. [laughs] Jim McMahon was almost like some kind of movie star that was the quarterback. Everybody wanted to be with the cool guy and that was Jimmy. He was dizzy with confidence. What quarterback has acted and played like Jim McMahon. There's not many of 'em, you know. Man, he was different. No team in the NFL had a quarterback like Jim McMahon. If I called a running play to Payne, there was a reason I called it. I wasn't trying to throw a touchdown pass. We were notorious, you know. We're gonna run Walter to death and every team in the league knew it so they'd crowd the box. So I said "why run into a brick wall when you don't have to?" People don't realize now most quarterbacks' helmets have microphones - so they're talking upstairs. In our day we had runners that run into the game with the play. But by the time the 3rd got to the huddle, the defense might've changed their front. So Jim Mac would normally go to the line with the either or... Two plays - not the play he was called from the sideline. He thought I was doing things just to piss him off. I told him... I said "look I'm trying to win the ball game." Sometimes he'd aggravate me when you called play and then he'd change it all the time. ...stuff you said it ain't right sometimes. 8, 9 times out of 10 Ditka has sent the plan and he's change the play. And so a lot of times I wouldn't call it. And he's be right. Sometimes he changed it right, sometimes he changed it wrong. He changed it wrong up in Minnesota, went for touchdown the other way. And he'd get pissed off and you know... play would work though. He changed a lot of them right that went for touchdowns our way... so I didn't profess every call I made was perfect, but we did it for a reason. He got frustrated with Mike a little bit because he wanted him to be like Roger Staubach. You know he'd watch 20 hours of film a week and Jim wouldn't like that. So we'd be in film sessions and then he would say you see that news and Jim would say 'I got it, I got it' He tried to give you this idea that he wasn't studying film but he knew what.... he knew he excited a lot - he knew it was going on. He had no fear in his eyes and I think the other team didn't know what to do with him. The highlight of the season for me was the game where McMahon came in and threw three touchdown passes one after another I can still see it now and it was as if the message went out... these guys have it. Something big is going to happen. He was like no other One of the smartest guys I ever played with. I've seen some quarterbacks who could throw the spiral thinking around like a halfback. I think he was the last of a dying breed. ...but they were not in their heart of hearts winners. You could tell McMahon wobble down in the field but he was a winner and the guys were magnets to McMahon's leadership. I know that feeling of kind of being vulnerable and like you just can't possibly get in trouble. It's like you can't get arrested at your uncle the sheriff's wedding... you know that kind of feeling it's like we can do anything we want here. He has an innate ability to lead men know he's a leader. Well he's all I wanted in a quarterback maybe he wasn't Johnny Unitas but he was our guy. Jim was a great quarterback, here... He didn't have all the physical skills. He didn't have the build that you want but he knew football and he was a competitor. I just loved it man... - ...anybody got headbutts at the offensive line like he did. - [Mantegna]It's the team play... - [Wendt] Yeah. - [Mantegna]that's what made them - [Wendt] Yeah. [Joe] so great Somehow he was the right fit for that for that Bears team. He was a quirky personality. He was she was very very different and for a guy who you think plays the quarterback in lead position maybe that's why it worked with a head coach like Ditka and a defense like the Bears. [narrator] For the first time in years football fans in Chicago had realistic Superbowl hopes. To this day I think he's you know, barefoot on the golf course somewhere... in like overalls, cackling. Cut to a picture of him doing that please... [Applause and cheers] [Drumbeat Music] The Bears have always been about tough defense well okay you can beat up the other team and still lose. This was starting to look like a team that maybe could beat up the other team and also win. We were learning how good we could be that year. The Bears hadn't won a division in a long time but I didn't realize it and almost every guy rededicated themselves at offseason to be ready. Like in the five minutes left in the fourth quarter I'm cutting my tape off my hands, I'm excited - can't wait to get on the plane have a beer celebrate and I look over and Jim Osbourne a guy that was in his fourteenth year was over there. And he had tears in his eyes and I'm thinking hey Ozzy are you hurt? I think finding the right guys who could make this offense run make this defense now become intimidating. And I said 'what are you crying for?' He goes 'man I'm happy.' He goes, 'this is the first time we ever won the division. We were very young. We didn't expect to be in a conference championship in '84. So not expecting and then believing that you belong... there's a transition that took place that year. And I thought to myself holy shit... he's played here 14 years and they've never won the division? And I look and there's the Gatorade thing. And I said 'hey here's what we're gonna do...' And he goes 'okay you get it and I'll run up and I'll hold Ditka so you can come up behind him and dump it on him. And the reason we did it the first ever Gatorade dump was because we wanted to commemorate something that hadn't happened in a long time. I'm gonna go getting the story how that started with us I'm not sure Harry started it with us... it could have been another player and Harry took it over. The year after we won the Super Bowl when the Giants won it, well at the end of the game they did it to Parcells and so the whole world thinks they started it. So it doesn't matter if the Bears did start it... we're getting credit for doing it there's no question. But we have documented proof that we did it two years prior up in Minnesota and you know what, I think our deal was probably just as big as the Giants' win in the Super Bowl. [narrator] Chicago capped off a hope-filled season with an embarrassing loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion 49ers. After the 23-0 shutout, safety Ronnie Lott remarked 'next time bring an offense' as the Bears exited the playing fields. That sardonic advice would not soon be forgotten by Ditka or his players. I took that personally I really did. I thought when we went out to play San Francisco that we could beat him with our defense. I really did. And I was wrong. It's a real blemish for that team and... it's not the score, it's just... losing. You can make an excuse and say Jim McMahon was hurt but we needed to have way more production than what we did so I know a lot of the offensive players especially the offensive line took that as personal insult. On the plane back from San Francisco I went up to everybody look them in the eye... come July make your mind up right now. And we can't wait till then to say okay we're going to do it we got to start them right now and and everybody to a man looked me in the eye and said 'yeah, let's do it.' He was fired up. And he got the rest of them fired up. So the off-season after that game was terrific. Our whole goal in that training camp was to get to the Super Bowl. And I told them in the locker room. After that game I said 'this one's on me'. I said 'this was my fault.' That was our focus. An entire training camp our entire focus going into the preseason games and then into the season is that we're going to the Super Bowl and we're gonna win it. I said 'the next time we played these guys, we will be ready. And coach Ditka made sure that we knew that. ...in '85 everybody had to have that goal, and when we came up one game short of the Super Bowl we decided that we're gonna get there this year. ♪♪ [Mike Singletary] When I first got to Chicago I really didn't know running backs at all. Everybody told me "man wait till you meet this guy Sweetness." I wasn't enamored, I wasn't excited because I only wanted to hear about some of the guys on the defense. We had the greatest player in the game. The greatest running back of all time. There will never ever ever ever be a better running back than Walter Payton. Every little kid who want to play the game that's what they wanted to be was Walter Payton. Guys at a certain point were kind of shying away from hitting him. He was a barker, he's lower his head and hit you so hard... he was a great receiver, a great teammate one of the toughest guys that I ever played with. I've never seen anybody like. The guy doesn't quit. Everybody should realize like the Greeks did about Hercules that Walter Payton was a demigod. One time I come in and Walter was doing repetition deadlifts at 525 pounds... and I said 'Walter!' He had a little hamstring problem and I said you got a hamstring problem. That muscle is involved in that exercise. He said 'ah its okay I don't feel nothing'. Born here on earth to do exactly what he did. They listed him at five ten and a half he was probably five nine 205 he had the vertical of Michael Jordan. When it was time to score they gave him the ball he shot up through the roof and landed on his head. No one has ever done that since. He's got a motor that never stops. I mean not only is he talented but you know, he's got a heart. Walter Payton one of the great gentlemen of the game. And so sweet and soft-spoken but unbelievably tough and just a beautiful running back. My rookie year watching him in a game and I was blown away by how fantastic he was. How tough he was. I think it was my rookie year - might have been my first start - I had called a play that wasn't in the game plan that week. And I gave it to Suhey and it was I think it was third and seven... he got nine yards and Walter pulled me aside and he says 'keep doing what you're doing. You're making us better. That's really the only thing he ever said to me on the field. He had a resolve that he wasn't gonna be beaten, he wasn't gonna be tackled, and you know, that's impossible - you are gonna be. But he felt like he couldn't be. I remember he was in a contest with OJ Simpson to win the title running. And OJ won that Sunday in Chicago and Walter Payton cried. He was that into his art. Anytime I meet a running back whether it's Tony Dorsett, Eric Dickerson, who was the best? They all say Walter Payton. Just a legend among the players even while he played. There's not many guys that are legends while they play... he was one of them. You know, he missed one game in 13 years so that's a football player. He either spanked you on the ass, which is good, or he'd give you a look which was not good. So you didn't want the look. Walter with the calming force on that team. Period. People in Chicago in love Walter. Walter was the heart and soul of the Bears for 10-15 years. He worked really hard. He exemplified what Chicago was all about. Blue-collar hard worker. And I think the end of the day it was really about highlighting who 34 was. Sweetness was so well liked and appreciated for all his skill and effort when the Bears weren't winning, that there was a sense of hey this is great, he's got a team around him. The total package of the great athlete the great [crowd cheering] mentality and a great brother. And if you weren't rooting for your own team you were rooting for him so you took notice of the things on a winner now... and he might get that Super Bowl he might get to the big game. [narrator] Walter Payton was a respected community activist, a team leader and one of the most prolific running backs the NFL had ever seen. He obtained legendary status even prior to his retirement from the sport in 1987. [ominous drumline music] Here comes refrigerator. Just the name carried an impression. ...blocking out the sky as the defenders tried to stop him as he dove into the line. The fridge was this brilliant athlete. We had fun watch him use his weight in the way we played good defense calls and run the ball every now and then. There are very few guys at that time that were, you know, as they said a biscuit over 300 pounds and yet had a vertical and they could move anywhere on the field. - [Barinholt] So to see a big - [Stassen] Yeah. [Barinholt] young guy out there just throwing guys around and laughing and smiling. A guy who looks like he shouldn't be able to move but has these feet that allow him not just to be a great defensive player but also start to run stuff into the goal line. I always related to him because I always had a - big gap in my tooth. - Big gap? yeah. I was watching him run sprints. And man, the first five yards he came out and that dirt will fly out behind his feet and he'd boooom... Jeez what if I put him in the back field in front of Walter? He was a bulldozer. I said well if he can block, why can't he run? So then I say okay we'll give him the ball. Same thing, bulldozer. So what I said is if he can block and if he can run, I said maybe he can catch. So we threw him a touchdown pass... we did all of that. Then finally I said well if he can run, he can block and he can catch, maybe he can throw! He couldn't throw. [laughs] The first time he ran that touchdown in, I lost my mind. He really was a refrigerator and he would just... it would take two or three guys to stop him just pushing forwards. They put him in the backfield and that was kind of unheard of at that time. It was so pervasive I remember my parents they went to England for a vacation and they had a cab driver and he was like 'where are you from?' And they're like Chicago. He goes 'oh, The Fridge.' Did you realize American football is popular in England now? Oh yes we've heard you talk about the Fridge, right sir? [all laugh] Like not Reagan or Al Capone or Babe Ruth but the one person he knew was the fridge. In the beginning it was very simple... I'm putting this guy in. I mean, I had a great fullback in Matt Suhey are you kidding me? he'll block anybody. This guy weighed 300 pounds - with that kind of force it didn't matter... he can move three people out of there. Just put Walter behind him, it was good. Maybe it was just another way to use a talent that we had. [narrator] William 'The Refrigerator' Perry was lampooned by the press and used as a pawn in his own coach's battles. At the end of the day he was just another capable athlete who would make his impact felt throughout the '85 season. Get out of here...! They took a fun orthodox approach with a very hard-nosed old-school coach. Mike Ditka was... he was he was the most interesting man in the world before there was the most interesting man in the world. On a national scale he was Chuck Norris, Walker Texas Ranger and he was broth and he was grouchy and he was mean but he was lovable that embodied all of the other personalities. You can take this to the bank my friends... "Live from New York, its Saturday night." [Wendt] This Bears team has given us so many memories, 310 sports bars, 289 DUIs. - [Mantegna] That's right... - [Wendt] and the night is young. - [Mantegna] Yeah that's right and I'm only on my eleventh beer. Like my third day in Chicago I went to Wrigley Field by myself and I think I'm having a great time Those SNL guys that George Wendt and Smigel and Michael Myers did... they exist in the parking lot outside Soldier Field. So I would go to other Chicago games... I started noticing a look. A lot of the intense fans they've all got the aviator shades and then they have these really thick walrus mustache. Mike Ditka is responsible for so many mustaches in the Chicagoland area. You know from a comedic perspective it's fun to look at them as crazy and sports obsessed but it was all a part of what makes Chicago great. Conan O'Brien and Bob Odenkirk and Robert Smigel kept trying to pitch it and it just laid there and never really worked. Joe was interested and so Lauren goes okay if he wants to do it. Bob said what if we did something sort of parodied the sports writers on TV. I figured well I'm from Chicago, maybe people in Chicago will get a kick out of it... Hello, welcome to another edition of Bill Swerski's super-fans. I'm Bob Swerski sitting in for my brother Phil... ...and we did it and it was great but what I found out the next day was, you know, people were calling from Chicago said you can't believe it - on the radio it got cut, they're re-running the skit constantly. [Stassen] The superfans sketch felt like the first time Saturday Night Live did something like provincial outside of the New York area. - [Barinholt] Yeah... [Stassen] You know, and it was cool it was Chicago and... [Barinholt] It was cool they were showing us as were are. Kielbasa, inhaling... having a hard time. You okay Ted? Hey hey he's just having a heart attack.. If the Greeks had tailgating this is what it would have sounded like... 'Oh golly we're gonna have some lamb here today.' That sort of temperate kind of casual voice and the love and respect they have for their meats and their sausages... We thank Ditka and God... - alright, is that okay? I mean - All that sausage... [studio audience laughs] - it's a family thing i think... - Ditka So when the explosion of the game occurs, [crowd cheering] the ribs rip open, you see the real warrior inside that person that it's only domesticated bison, fine sausage bison, fine grill, you know? There was this arrogance to the fans they like to drink they like to strut around cocky even though their teams really sucked. Listen if they're your team they're your team, you know, when they suck and then when they're great and I feel like, you know, the Chicago fans are very loyal. There was this one guy in particular he not only had the shades and the stache but he was wearing a hula skirt and a coconut bra everybody else is going Bears Bears...! Whatever - they're just you know yelling at the camera the way all sports fans do this guy's not saying a word she's just completely focused, just... it's like a mission he's on. He's got a hula. I'm just writing dialogue in my head the only thing I could imagine him doing is bears, bears, bears, bears... There were so many characters on the team and I think Chicago is one of these towns where you have hard-working people they look you in the eyes and they aren't afraid to be exactly who they are and I think the Bears took on that identity. I can't think of it came they had more disparate personalities than that group. Guys who did things that were unusual in that you couldn't understand how they all got along, how they all were together, guys who were half-crazy, bookish guys who were conmen, guys who were... everything in the world and its like whoa! This is crazy. The Bears all contributed to a kind of theatrical production where everybody has a solo part. A cast of characters who, first things first is football but then they turn the joy of football into a kind of... they spread the joy around. It could have been a reality show just following this team around the arguments, the personalities that came out. I can't imagine the reality show based on the Chicago Bears it would have been incredible. It would have been x-rated, it would have been attended and watched by everybody. When were we going to see something like that? They worked hard they played hard and they just truly weren't afraid to be who they were. They were crazy I was crazy when I was a player off the field too. They were crazy, but that's okay. That's a team that to pull one guy out is probably one of the most difficult thing to do. It made for interesting route because everyone was on their toes and we wanted to win in spite of each other sometimes. We wanted to win in spite of the coaches sometimes. They let their hair down but that's fine... there's no problem. But when they came back to work they were ready to go to work. And they knew it because we practiced hard. We probably practiced harder than anybody in football probably in the last 20 years. They were so original in their own way and yet they blended together to have such great success. It was not only great players on the field but great personalities off the field and that's what made 'em kind of Chicago's team and they became America's team. We all felt better because it was the one thing... In church on Sunday, locker room on Monday morning... It was the best. Now do you and Mike Ditka have that agreement whereby if you choose to, you can override his? We have a lot of agreements. [audience laughs] Is Jim McMahon nuts? [audience laughs] We had people coming from all over the world to watch us practice from China, from Russia, from Japan, from Germany, all over the United States, everyone wanted to see us practice and I think it became like a huge circus. We were truly a carnival act on the road. We'd go in to Indianapolis, we'd go in to Miami and there'd be 2,000 people in the hotel lobby. Couldn't walk around town it was like you were chum in the water and the Sharks were friends of you. We were rock stars, really. I mean we were the biggest rock stars. You're gonna put us on the stage with U2 or fucking dellux or whoever you wanted to. And as a family we couldn't even really go out to eat. We couldn't do a lot in the public because the people would run up to my dad it would become like this big huge scene. When I first came to town you were anonymous. There was internet back then - none of these social media platforms. Now your Instagram baby. They went somewhere and they would shut the place down. They call them fanatics that's where fan comes from. They were in full flourish and I loved every minute of it. Reasoning went through the roof everytime we were on TV We were so loud anywhere we went even on the road and majority people in the stance weren't home team fans - they were visiting fans from Chicago cheering the Bears on. I made a lot of money on merchandise and sold. We were the number one in every sport. Understand the impact. Well I don't think anybody minds getting endorsements. [all singing] 'come on in... its playoff time- We are here to win.' Walter Payton obviously had a lot of different endorsements including those Roos shoes. Fridge was doing Cadillac commercials. I like the headroom. I got a Nike poster on a billboard and then it was right at O'Hare and so anytime I came back from my parents at Barrington I'd see myself. People were ecstatic... bring on this party. We've got something the world has never seen. At least the world of the NFL and it's Chicago with the miserable winners and all... it was just there was this joyous feeling... Hey look at me I look good out there... - What about this... - Oh wait a minute. My mom's gonna be proud. ...Crain's Chicago business had this cartoon where I was driving the Cadillac, Walter's throwing out chicken bones because he was doing Kentucky Fried Chicken and in The Fridge was just down in this position. So it's kind of like hey these guys are a little out of control... Is it getting to their head? [dramatic music] [Ditka] You know, there's no question we were the better football team. You can analyze it any way you want to. We are the better football team and we created the things that happened for all of you... Our defense created turnovers, our special teams created turnovers. We don't have to apologize to anybody for that. We were 12 and 0, already clinched the division and home field advantage throughout the playoffs... you know, and our goal was to go undefeated. [commentator] It's off to the Orange Bowl where the Dolphins were desperately trying to protect Miami's perfect record of 17 and O set back in 1972. Coach Shula didn't talk all week about the fact that they were the '72 team and we needed to beat the Bears to preserve that record so it really didn't come up much but we knew it as players. Give Miami credit, you know... they were certainly fired up because they didn't want to lose the title of the undefeated team. I knew going into that game that they could be a tough one. [narrator] Although the '85 Bears enjoyed more than their fair share of success and limelight the season wasn't always fun and games. [crowd cheering] [thumps and groans from impact] Into every life a little rain must fall, and for the '85 Bears at downpour landed on the turf Miami's historic Orange Bowl. [Singletary] Miami was a wake-up call. It was a wake up call that we had the privilege of receiving. We really did not play well that game. They said no matter who you are, no matter how great do you think you are, blink and you're done. I was sobbing like a grandmother on my hands and knees in a bar. It was a tragic moment. It was a long ride back to Chicago. I think that that kind of reset some egos. There's a lot of things that went their way. Dan Marino is a great player, quick release, the whole works and all... Going into that game I knew they were they were going to come after us and I felt like we matched up really well. Jim Covert and Dan Marino were roommates in Pittsburgh I remember Jim talking to Buddy saying 'Dan Morino when he lets the ball go on three steps, five steps, your linebackers are gonna have trouble covering his receivers and you're gonna need to maybe change some things up -but Buddy wasn't gonna do that. Now I'm not trying to to be humble or anything... I'm just telling you, we were out-coached that day and they spread our defense out, which was what you had to do if you're gonna try to be successful against it. I give the Dolphins all the credit they just were prepared, they played a great game. Marino was awesome. My take on Miami was... It was a gift. All of us were a little bit cocky because we were pretty good and that kind of brought us back to earth. I think if we win in Miami we lose in New Orleans. Every team of destiny that has won the big game will tell you there is a point during the season that refocused them. They're authentic champions and they had that special something even when they were down they got up again... because on the ground, there's no place for a champion. ♪ Groovy music "we are the best, shuffling crew. Shuffle on down, do it for you." The Super Bowl shuffle. Well it's pretty it's pretty great groove. I thought they were crazy. You know, and if you get in your head you're in trouble. The reason I thought they were crazy because it was pretty you know, egotistical to say that you were going to the Super Bowl and we hadn't gotten to the Super Bowl yet. They had scheduled to film the Super Bowl freaking shuffle the day after we got back from Monday night. Now we get in at 3 o'clock in the morning on Tuesday and they start filming that thing at 7:00. After we got our tail whipped. They're gonna be bragging about 'we're going to the Super Bowl...' Oh I was mad at 'em. Willie Gault was the spearhead guy behind that. I worked with Dick Meyers to come up with lyrics of each guy, told 'em what each guy's nickname was and everything else and got the lyrics turned in and then went to Mr. Myers' house which he had a studio in his house. He was trying to do something to raise money in Chicago the proceeds of the rap video go to the charity. And then I had to do this job of trying to convince these guys to do a video. On the plane, tried to talk to everyone in the video and tried to make sure they got there on Tuesday because if we didn't do it we had the facility already paid for, all the crew already there, and you know, we had to do it then. If we didn't do it then it'd never take place. We had no idea that we even had a commitment to do a video. Ten of us were in, a lot of them said let's put in the car the Florida whores - they wanted no part of that. They asked me to be in it and I said I can't be in it. When he approached me about it, you know, being in it in some way shape or form I don't think in a rapping part but I just didn't believe in it. I was not really invited to do that, it wasn't really my style. I wasn't asked to participate, if I had been I would have said no. Who didn't go? McMichael didn't do it? Because he's like... [squeaky impression] "yes I'm not gonna do it - because its stupid!" Mad at them, they went ahead and did it. Some of the guys did it at the Park West and then McMahon and Payton did it at that household. They didn't think that they should do it because we had lost and they thought maybe its bad luck if we do it. You know they later got mad again... So in the afternoon Walter could see the rest of the guys what they did the morning. He called me up on the phone, he goes 'are you in this' I said 'no i'm not in that' He goes 'good'. We were embarrassed, we were frustrated, we were searching for answers and sometimes in life there are no answers. Sometimes you just got to go out there and start swinging again. The dance and the Super Bowl video was a statement. When we shot on Sunday we didn't go home as victors on Monday morning. I mean winning is what we do. It wasn't even arrogant. It was just cool. It was so cool. My school had multiple assemblies during this season where just every grade got up and formed a - [Stassen] Super Bowl shuffle... - [Barinholt] yeah i did it... [Stassen] this wasn't decided to be more important than education. [Stassen] It was like, "now first grade go!" - [Barinholt] Yeah yeah yeah. [Stassen] second grade... More of you, Fred. [Barinholt] We won't be learning geography today. Do Otis Wilson's verse, go! Jeremy, go! I think it shows their clarity of intent I think they knew what they needed to do when they were ready to do it. Anybody with the audacity had to either be knocked out and slapped down or win it all. It's just, everything about it was unique because yes at the root of it was an incredible amount of arrogance that's what they had. You almost saw it in their faces. You saw it in their arrogance that we're not gonna, you know, we're not gonna walk away embarrassed like we made this video and then couldn't back it out we are going to back it up. If confidence is there and you're not the best it's really just foolishness, but the Bears knew they were better than anybody. They knew that and they weren't wrong. And they backed that up. They believed that they were going to the Super Bowl if you don't believe you're going super you aren't going to the Super Bowl. It's not complicated. Other teams didn't even react really poorly to it. They didn't even go like 'these guys a bunch of jerks.' There was a calm about it. A confidence about it where you went oh my jeez... they really are going to kill us. They knew they had the right players the right chemistry and the right coaching. People say oh that was egotistical I don't give a damn what people think. It was the ultimate intimidation I thought We were nominated for Grammy. We gave money to charity, we helped a lot of people and we became rockstars in a sense. So... we came back that very next day and did the Super Bowl shuffle that was a gift. You see guys are actually trying their dance steps. I didn't know what we had to do. First off I can't dance anyway and it was obvious that neither could Gary Fencik or Steve fuller. We're listening to guys singing that can't sing, guys trying to dance that couldn't dance we're laughing we're having a ball... Fencik had a little bit of an American Bandstand move to it but he was vicious in it too. [crowd cheers and whistles] [players rumbling] We weren't searching for answers we just got back to doing what we do. And we let things go we didn't try to over analyze or emphasize anything and then let it go guys we still got each other let's go get. ♪ Music What it created was a lot more resolve on our football team that we weren't gonna let it happen again. It allowed us to kind of take a step back and say guys if we don't go to the Super Bowl and we've created this thing here in a tenth game of the season we gotta make this thing now become a reality. After the loss to Miami our football team really... the confidence grew and grew and grew. So week in week out you know, we were on it. And then boom boom boom. [crowd cheers and whistles] [players rustling against each other] I noticed through the grindstone.. [crowd cheering] We were chopping it... we were rocking! [crowd cheering] There was purpose... [crowd cheering] They just picked the town up and... I never really thought anyone would ever put a Bears helmet on those lions and in front of the Art Institute, you know? I never thought that would happen in my lifetime. Both personally and I think for the city as a whole, suddenly we start seeing this team that not only is great, not only has this defense that can shut everybody down but is full of these personalities. That was pretty special for the city of Chicago and the Bears and football. Everyone had a sort of, 'you know we're getting ready for war here, you know, this is it. Here they come.' It was almost like we were fighting like Sparta against you know, Athens or something like that it was us against the giant. The pregame warmups were over the field and here in time for the opening kickoff. The weather was trying to get really nasty and it was starting to become Bear weather... [players groan and grunt from impact] [crowd cheers] woooooooo...! I think what stands out was that they thought the Bears might stumble on offense... would Jim McMahon be enough.. [crowd cheering] And then LA... how great was it to be LA in the playoffs...? Many people thought that the Rams and then the running game of the Rams with Eric Dickerson could break through anything. And we prided ourselves on the run game. The heart of the defense... in the middle - Steve McMichael, Dan Hampton and myself - we're facing a team that could come to our home and they're saying, we're hearing, that they're going to run up and down the field. It ain't happening. They had Dickerson and they didn't just stop them - they stunned them stone cold and then it was as if they turned a superstar Hall of Fame running back into an average back. It was like an animal kill it really was like actual bears mauling smaller beings like a ram. Like a bear mauling a ram. To this day no team has shut out division and conference championship in the same year. I mean it was ridiculous. It just really was the law of the jungle you know... when the ball was stamped. I mean those were like an ode to everything that the Bears had come to stand for in their time. We're not gonna be stopped we're gonna win the Super Bowl. That's how the Bears should win - the way they won those two playoff games. Late in the game it starts snowing and it's just like a storybook ending to the season. That sent an impressive message and then you just figured nobody could stop the Bears. [players rumbling over each other] As a Bear fan we expected it... [laughs] of course they should uphold us. They're the best defense ever. For four years I've been waiting to go and it was finally a reality. So we knew were headed to the Super Bowl. Those games, those shutouts against Los Angeles and New York to Giants and Rams... they were basically... those were art. They were football art! These were good teams, quality teams. The defense had given up no points. People were ecstatic. To be in LA and New York back-to-back in the playoffs and shut 'em out... shut 'em out and beat 'em up you know, that was... that was livid. It was bring on the Super Bowl, bring on New Orleans bring on this party we've got something the world has never seen. [crowd cheering] John, tonight Bourbon Street is being renamed Bear Street... There was one story. The Bears were going to the Super Bowl. It was going to be in New Orleans and we were gonna marshal an army. - The next five days is Bear country. And when Sunday comes and we win, we'll give back the city of New Orleans and we'll go back to Chicago to party... yeaaah....! [cheers] People were excited but they couldn't get enough of the Bears. I'm from Chicagoooooo! [indistinct yelling in background] Home of the Bears! Bozooo! There's probably no team in history that had as much fun as those guys playing football, winning and interacting with the fans. I mean they were great. I think Chicago fans are greatest fans in the world. So far Ditka's playing it right. The last 10 pages of the sports section was all Bears. It was just, you know, they couldn't get enough of it. So it was just like a big circus leading up to the fireworks at the end of the week. How do you feel about being out here with all these Chicago fans? - Good party crowd... - Okay. We love it. Yeaaaahhh... [cheers] You'd have 12 storylines. Every one of those personalities - where they're going, how they like Bourbon Street oh look at the crazy people. We'd just, you know, tell all the fans to come to our spot so they all come up to the bar at the hotel and it was like, you know, free for all. You you you you. Let's go. New Orleans is perfect because that's a 24 hour party scene on Bourbon Street to French Square, they like firstly insist you take a cup of liquor on your way out of the bar. You're supposed to carry them around, nothing ever closes... you're putting the Bears, the Chicago Bears down there? I think in New Orleans there might have been 20,000 fans who didn't have a ticket. They just wanted to be with the team. These meatballs, homemade potato salad... down here, roast beef, I'm telling you the Fridge would love the place... I could just see like McMichael on Bourbon Street on his 15th hurricane saying "all right let's take it over to the blues bar." We'd go all the way to the end of the street and start... and have a drink at every bar before the week is over. I would've hated the New England Patriots to be in New Orleans and feel like you know they're like step kids at a wedding or something. Patriot and former University of Illinois quarterback Tony Eason was eating Italian with some of his teammates here at Tony's pizza within earshot of the Bears hoopla. I've never seen so many people on Bourbon Street. I've never seen so many people in Chicago on Bourbon Street. Nobody wanted them there, nobody cared about 'em, every bar had Bears stuff up. Every bar had the Super Bowl shuffle play. Well the first night my mother's waiting... I'd say we're going all the way down to the end of the street there's a bar on the left, we're going in. I didn't know it was a transvestite bar... [laughs] We walked in and she saw what was going on she said "you gotta get me out of here I'm a school teacher" - so we went to the next one. It was like Friday night before the game and it's like midnight, one o'clock in one of those bars you know on Bourbon Street and I'm in there with a bunch of like esteemed NFL players from around the league and they were all in there asking 'what about this McMahon he seems like he's insane and this and that.' I was having fun... we got to thinking got in on Monday afternoon and Monday Tuesday Wednesday we didn't have any curfews - It was quite fun down on Bourbon Street. And he would ricochet through, and then he'd ricochet back through and he would bounced off different people and you would see other people that he had crashed into or bounced off of. And I said no no no no he's okay. He's really kind of sly like a cat you know? And as I'm telling this group of guys, this story, unbeknownst to me McMahon is walking in the bar at one o'clock with these eyeballs on springs that are going in and out like this and he's got two beers in each hand and I look around behind me and I see him and I go, 'okay forget it he is insane... [laughs] Nothing I can do to change your opinion about that.' They're all having a fantastic fantastic time and they knew what they were going to do. Most of us for the most part stayed out of trouble. We have an update on what Mr. McMahon said in an interview today. I understand he said most of the ladies he ran into were sluts, he said most of the people he ran into were stupid. And the punk EQB who's outspoken, who's brash is rumored to have dissed the women of New Orleans Thursday morning I got woken up by some irate fans screaming yelling they're gonna kill me. And the local sportscaster Buddy Diliberto was the one who broke the story. I didn't know who it was. I slammed the phone down. It rang two minutes later and my roommate Kurt Backer saying who keeps calling? I said well there's a bunch of fans and they're pissed off of me for something. So in the restaurant Buddy Diliberto said it was overheard that Jim McMahon made comments about you know how the city was not very clean how the people weren't very smart and how the women were were loose. And Dick finally came up to me said did you really call all the women sluts? I said what are you talking about, Mike? And he said well supposedly you were on a radio station this morning calling all the women of New Orleans sluts and this and that. You're here for the biggest game of your life... let's just stay focused on what our goal is and win the Super Bowl and that's what I told him. And I said what time was this? And he said 6 o'clock. I said dude I didn't get back to my room till 5. I said I was not waking up at 6 to talk to no reporter. He came and told me... I thought it was a decent answer. But if they want to believe it let 'em... I don't care... If it's not true... but suddenly the rumors spread. So the rest of the week I was getting death threats and our practice field was the old Saints facility which there was a big apartment complex that overlooked the field... so I couldn't wear my own Jersey, the guys didn't want to stand by because they thought I was gonna get shot. So that was my whole focus the rest of the week was to not get killed... It wasn't what, you know, the Super Bowl should have been like the Super Bowl week... it was for the first three days but after that it sucked. Management of WDSU TV has reviewed the facts surrounding comments made by our sports director and certain comments attributed to Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon last night. We have no basis to believe the statements about New Orleans attributed to Mr. McMahon were ever made. The night before the game we have a team meeting and Buddy would always say a few words and then he would leave and then we would have to watch one reel of film... we always did it. Buddy Ryan that night... something was different in his speech, there were tears in his eyes and he said no matter what happens tommorrow you guys will always being my heroes. That's when I knew but he was leaving. I was like oh gosh and I started crying a little bit and next to Singletary I go, 'I can't believe he's leaving .' And Singletary's eyes got like this and he looked at me and goes 'oh my god he doesn't know.' I tell people that it enraged me so bad he was leaving that I got up and threw the chair into the blackboard and like a movie special effect that stuck in it... booow! I mean it was unbelievable. Well that fired up Dan Hampton he got up and clubbed the projector... the old millimeter projector just broke and shattered. The jig is up all these years... you know why I threw that chair? Why it pissed me off and I threw that chair in that blackboard? I turned around and the meanest guys you're ever gonna see on a football field... there wasn't a dry eye in the house... they were all squalid. You know it's cathartic in a way I was sad because I knew in less than 24 hours it was gonna be the most important game of my life and I knew that you know, we were gonna have a different defensive coordinator the following year. So I remember being with Dan Hampton and Steve McMichael the night before the game and the whole event with the projector had just happened and they said they were they saying 'well here's what just happened - they told me was happening...' I thought, 'well that's focus.' Monsters of the Midway had tears in their eyes. I stood up and I look back at him and this is how the jig is up... I said 'we got the biggest game of my life tomorrow you bunch of crybabies...' ...and threw the chair into the blackboard in that rage. [cheers] [marching band music] Before the circus leaves town you're gonna see the three-ring thing that's right in front of everybody and sure enough that's what it was. ...the singing in New Orleans, it was electric. [crowd cheering] [players rumbling against each other] [screams and cheers] It's funny the game to me is an actual blur. It was as if it was over before it started. Mutilation. [crowd cheering] We weren't gonna be denied. It didn't matter who we played, we weren't gonna lose that game. We felt that from the newspapers to the sports casters to the politicians, we were all one... from battle ground to common ground. New England, tough luck, better luck next year... That's the way it is. The Patriots had no chance. I mean the Bears was an avalanche of Chicago doing whatever they wanted to do. We were the better football team. If they kept playing this forward it would've been about 200 to 10. Well usually when that happens the better football team wins. I think the greatest thing about the Super Bowl, every guy on that squad got a chance to play. Everybody. They were good, don't get me wrong... but our defense took all the starch out of their offense. Coach took out all the starters in the third quarter, you know, because we don't get there without each other and that's what it's really all about. Like I said it's been a long time coming and we're gonna celebrate. It's over, we've finally done it, we're at the top of the hill and congratulations Chicago you deserve it. [Cheers in background] [speaking indistinctly] You're always the second fiddle... [fans roaring] So now he's got a weird little frontpage story around the world and that was by a tremendous amount of hard work and dedication and an organization that deserves some credit. Who's left? London? You know, whatever, we'll take on anybody. You looked up and they were celebrating and carrying off on the shoulder. Buddy was just a great coach that did a great job and he did a great job for us then. He really did. Greatness to me is when you are able to bring desire to play for one another. That kind of pride and love it's a very difficult thing to find and so it really comes unfair because there's so much in sync and there's so much chemistry when they get together it's an explosion and I think when you look at the '85 Bears that's what you see... that's what was in the huddle. ...that's what took us from one game to the other... that's what took us to the Super Bowl. Look I think we're one of the best teams to have ever played in this game before. We gotta admit. [Reporter] How does it feel in your hands? Notice how I sort of... I keep hefting it? That's a beautiful trophy and it feels just good... When champions win... the people put the champions on their shoulders - he is the champion - but you're just a champion until the next ball game... but heroes put the people on their shoulders... we were on the shoulders of the Bears It's a great time in America. The Bears won the Super Bowl. [crowd cheers and whistles] As a fan watching the game and as somebody who watches football for a living, I remember thinking as the score crept up... Walter hasn't scored. At that time I don't think anybody even thought about it. You know, I mean it wasn't like if we would have thought about it all the offensive line would have said give me the ball thirty times in a row. That still stings We realized very quickly afterwards it was a huge deal to him, a huge deal. Walter had a child's pride and a child's ego and a child's drive in a good way. Not childish, but a childlike... and it really hurt him and I know that might be Mike Ditka's biggest regret. It was kind of my fault in a sense. I didn't think it was that important. I mean when you put 46 points on the board, to a lot of people... I didn't think it was that important and I found out it was to Walter and that bothered me afterward. You know I was at the game it didn't seem like a big deal at all to me as an observer. We all know who Walter Payton was we all knew he was an instant hall-of-famer... ...and the best running back in NFL history never scored in a Super Bowl. I mean, to me that was a tragedy. I don't think... at the time we're just doing our job and we're just trying to get the job done and bought for whatever, but I think there were so many opportunities for him to score touchdowns. I don't know who masterminded that but you know, that should have never happened. Later on in life it was one of the things I had to say to him that you're the greatest running back in the NFL but I just caught a touchdown in the Super Bowl and you didn't. And his response wasn't very nice. I just hated that that attached itself to Walter. If you look at it on film when we watched the film afterwards, it's interesting because you know when when Walter would... when we'd fake it to Walter on a play action, half the defense would go over there and their number one game plan was to stop Walter Payton. And we all knew he was a decoy too. You know if Matt Suhey was going to take the ball because there's five guys watching Payton so be it. You know, appreciate just your role there Walter. There's nothing I could have done about it, I really couldn't. I guess yeah there's something I could have done about it - I could have called the the running play to him four or five times once we got down there... I just wish I could think what I'm feel now but I can't I just want the fans to know that I really appreciate them standing by me and all the love that they've given me and showed me through getting here. He was sad, you know he wanted that for himself and I wish he would have told us that, that he wanted that but he was such a private person that he never would have said anything. I'm so glad and proud of him that he came out and he talked even though he was upset because things aren't always gonna go your way and he taught me that. Walter Payton had done so much to get the Bears there and he'd done so much to condition players to win. He conditioned players to play and his point was when you get knocked down you're measured up by how fast you run, by how fast get up and even though you're down sometimes, the ground is no place for a champion. Still some people aren't over the touchdown in the Super Bowl. To me that's not, you know, that big a deal I mean he is great a player as he was, he finally got the ultimate team prize in winning the Super Bowl and and he has his teammates and Ditka and the '85 Bears to thank for it. I wish I could have been a little better and understood it a little better because of course I would've handed it to him. It didn't matter to me. And you could just sort of see his face and it just... I sort of never got over it. By me being a perfectionist, didn't take away from the game, something else takes away from it. But like I said, I don't wanna talk about it right now because we won. I wanna be happy. ..and my son here got the chance to see me play in my first Super Bowl and we won it. That's all that matters. [interviewer] Did you and him discuss it afterwards? - Yeah we talked about it. [interviewer] What was that discussion? - Well he was hurt by it, because I think it means something to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl. I mean it does and you know, I scored one when I was a player so I gave it to Walter so he had his. ♪ Music fades out [cheers] [marching band] There was 45,000 people lined up in the streets at a parade in a sub-zero weather. It showed you how dedicated those people were.. how our fans were and how excited they were and they'd do the same thing this year. If the Bears won the Super Bowl and it were 20-30 below zero, they would be there. Because that's who they are. This is a big deal for Chicago and it was really big. I was one of the guys doing the pro ball and we didn't go back for the parade and that's one of my biggest regrets. [loud cheers] It's been a great day! We're number one! We're number one! We're number oooone! And I just wish we would have said we're going back for the parade and we'll get there when we gotta get there. [Applause] Hey you just make your plans for Pasadena 'cos that's where we're stopping next year. On more time... [loud cheers and screams] would just like to say thank you for your support, its a whole team at city effort. [Applause and cheers] We brought the championship home to Chicago. Thank you. [narrator] The Bears had won the Super Bowl, a proud city had paraded their victors and two decades of sports failure was replaced in an instant with newfound pride and swagger. [news reporter 1] This is a live picture... let me repeat because this story is a breaking story. This is launch control at t-minus 2 hours 28 minutes and counting, here comes the 51 all flight crew boarding the elevator. [news reporter 2] You can finally hear the excitement here at the Kennedy Space center... [narrator] On January 28 1986 just two days after Chicago's heralded victory -[radio] 3,2,1 and liftoff! Liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission... [narrator] ...NASA launched its space shuttle Challenger. [indistinct radio announcement] [indistinct radio announcement] Challenger, go at throttle up. [blowout] [crowd screaming] [President Ronald Reagan] Today is a day for mourning and remembrance. Nancy and I are in pain to the core about the tragedy of the shuttle Challenge. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery - taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted. [newscaster 1] There are two separate fumes of smoke in the shuttle uh... we can't tell which one the shuttle is now. They've separated... [radio broadcaster] ...flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction... [radio broadcaster 2] Flight's auto. Our SO reports vehicle exploded. [radio broadcaster 3] There's absolutely no sign of the Challenger. [President Reagan] ..their dedication was complete. The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us for the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye, and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God. [narrator] Chicago's Super Bowl celebration was understandably cut short as Bears fans joined fellow Americans in mourning the tragedy that fell upon our seven brave astronauts. ♪ Music fades out The Bears somewhat epitomized our sense of coming together and just the city coming together around ultimately, where black, white, brown found common ground. The Bears is the common ground and that's the thing about athletics that's so magnetic. They all came from different backgrounds perfect example of what a team should be. Different backgrounds, different schools, love of the game that had to join together in one purpose, one focus and when theball was snapped... they were all one and they were bigger than life. The team has been back to Super Bowl one time but it hasn't won so that triumphant, defiant team coming back to the city after winning something like that... we haven't seen with the Bears. I don't think there is a member of that team that that people don't celebrate. Their memory is going to be exalted until something else comes along to take its place and nothing really has come close. We weren't just football players - we were entertainers too. We were all over this town, radio, TV, gaffing and making jokes... And it was one of the first times that you saw people off the field. You know, we didn't have our helmets on and you saw these characters and they were real and they were interesting and they were fun. Hail the damn Super Bowl shuffle. I still have people to this day come up to tell me I loved you in the Super Bowl shuffle... and I wasn't in the damn thing. They obviously liked what they did and we had a very dynamic head coach. I mean today I know that most Bear fans know the offensive line for the '85 team and they don't know the team today. You know, everybody was just their own individual person and you know we were lucky enough Mike let us, for the most part he let us be ourselves. And so slowly what you saw with these bears was not only championship caliber football but you also saw them bring the city together in a way that I really think had enormous impact on the Renaissance of Chicago. You know the myth... it's the myth that gets larger than life. ♪ Music fades out [narrator] All teams, all families, no matter how great must eventually suffer some loss. While a defeat on the playing field can be difficult to accept, nothing is harder to absorb than the loss of a brother, a teammate, a friend. The football world has been rocked this week by the sad death of a former star. The Super Bowl-winning safety Dave Duerson took his own life convinced that the despair he faced was caused in part by the damage he suffered on the football field... and as Sharon Alfonze reports he wanted other football players to think hard about the dangers they face. I think when people look back on this Bears team with all the personalities and players who gave their heart and soul and their bodies to the success of this team that the tragedy is Dave Duerson and how his life later ended. Dave was a very bright player. Dave was from Indiana - a rural town in Indiana. Notre Dame, all-american, all-pro defensive back... and a series of forces began to collide on him. [commentator] ...the first four. This one's for Giles... intercepted by Duerson. [reporter] Teammates say Dave Duerson was also exceptionally smart and kind which is why they were shocked when last week the 50 year old killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. And I think at the time when you think of the 80s we didn't have the advances in medicine and science that that we have now for players. I think when a member of this greatest team ever, arguably, all the sudden decides to kill himself and you know doctors say this is what he had I think it just crystallizes the problem even more. Mr. Duerson committed suicide on February 17th 2011 he left a note and text message asking for his brain to be studied reading, "please see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain Bank." He had expressed concerns about his mental health and he shot himself in the chest presumably to preserve his brain for studies. So yet another '85 Bear making a contribution beyond the playing field to science and to longevity and Dave Duerson would be a big factor in changing the nature of the game. No more bell ringing, no more playing this and no more playing out of your head... all of this kind of goes back to how Dave Duerson's situation has been handled. Buddy Ryan was laid to rest today in Lawrenceburg Kentucky. The man who invented the 46 defense and helped the Chicago Bears win the 1985 Super Bowl. You know there were so many great parts of that team you know... sure the defense, Walter Payton, Mike Ditka, the Fridge... but I said you cannot tell the story that they're the greatest team of all time without starting at Buddy Ryan. Buddy was a big 'ol team wall. He knew that no matter how much of a genius he was, he knew that no matter how strong Hampton was, he knew that no matter how smart Fencik was, it really did not matter if we did not come together and played as a team. If you ask each and every one of these players they'll all echo the same sentiment that no matter what success they were able to have, not only in football but in the walk of life, so much of it was drawn from their experiences with Buddy Ryan. [narrator] James David Buddy Ryan changed the defensive end of the game forever. He will be missed by many on and off the field. There's a moment where we were sitting at his office and we're sitting there and we're opening up these bags of a mail from all over the world. And I turned and looked at him and he was just... had this look on his face like, 'I had no clue...' I go 'what do you mean you had no clue?' He goes, 'I had no clue that I impacted all these people.' You know, Walter meant so much to me throughout my life. I always remember the picture he took of my grandmother. Payton's just got this big genuine smile and I was like I always look at that thing... that's probably the 50,000th picture that man has taken and he just it couldn't have been happier to be with my bubby and be... so when I recently had my second daughter we named her after him and just because he really does represent hard work and you know kindness and he just reminds me of one of the happiest times in my life which is watching him play when I was a kid. So yeah we named my daughter Walter, Payton. We named her Payton. The kind of blue collar mentality of Walter Payton that was so Chicago. Even before they got the great team he was the guy bucking the Oz and I knew he was a real winner. I knew what getting to the Hall-of-Fame meant to him and for him to have his son induct him into the Hall-of-Fame and that moment that we shared on the stage after I got done and he hugged me... it was a different type of hard. Our top story is the health of Walter Payton. His friends, his teammates, fans all call him 'Sweetness' but there is no sugarcoating the fact that Payton is now facing the challenge of his life. At a news conference today Walter and his doctor explained that the Bear great has been placed on the waiting list for a liver transplant. To people that really care about me, just continue to pray. And for those who're gonna say what they wanna say, may God be with you also. [Jarret Payton] He was an unbelievable dad and I actually get really upset because I only got 19 years. That's why life is so sweet that you have to kind of cherish every single moment that you have with people that you love. In some ways that team was like a comet across the sky. It's a sports tragedy that the Bears didn't repeat when you think about how long the city of Chicago and fans had to wait for them to finally get a Super Bowl title, they do that seems like they have all the pieces in place to repeat or at least be back for more and it doesn't happen. Even today if Buddy was here I would say 'Buddy, why don't you just sacrifice being a head coach for like two more years.' We were just hoping that team could have stayed together a couple more years because they had all the right stuff. I think it's one of the great disappointments in the history of Chicago sports after one of the greatest successes. I guarantee you we would have had three championships in a row. But in my opinion yeah if Buddy Ryan had hung around I think the Bears would have been back. We didn't look long-term as an organization on an investment on some great group of guys that you would never see together again and because of that our reign was short. You never followed a guy for trying to go to a head coaching position from an assistant position. I'm very disappointed that there was no dynasty in '85, '86 when we won... because at the time we won the Super Bowl we were the youngest team ever to win a Super Bowl. We averaged 24.5 years of age which had never been done before. Why didn't we win more Super Bowls? you know I... I scratch my head and wonder that myself. The first thing we did wrong was we dismantled a lot of our football team. When we won that first one you figured we were going to win two or three or four more. When you start taking key pieces of the puzzle that we put in the win and you start getting rid of them... We'd end up being like the Steelers or the Patriots in the sense of putting together just a series of great teams. I wasn't for that, I've said that and I'll say it again. I think it's simple we didn't have Jim McMahon And we played three or four games a week and our practices were not easy.. [thumps on the ground] We had pads on all the time we were doing live drills, live hitting drills I mean it was... it was just like a game. If Jim McMahon would have stayed healthy and answered the bow every game we would've definitely won a couple more Super Bowls. It wears you out... I think that's why we didn't win anymore ball games. You know a bunch of stuff happened that you know happens in sports sometimes, a little bit of bad luck. I think the reality is everybody wants a little more, a little bigger piece of the pie, a little more money and you have to try to control it - the guys are out writing books or doing shows and not focusing on what got him there in the first place. We built that team around those people and all of a sudden they're not there there...? There was nothing like salary caps so there was a group of teams that could dominate... so to me that's the number one reason. There's no other single-season team that you're like... that you think of as a dynasty but the '85 Bears you're like, to the casual observer I'm like 'they won a couple Super Bowls right?' well no we just won the one but we were really good. It was unfortunate that it went away so quickly and there were injuries and Buddy left and you know stuff kind of... it just kind of went away but that thing glowed for years it still glows well what are we talking about. Sometimes things are like a magnesium flare. In other words they ignite and it burns red-hot for a brief period and then like a flare it just kind of tends to then disappear. Just as David did with Goliath and Samson did with the Philistines they had that special almost a spiritual quality. It's a shame that team didn't win more. It's inexplicable that team didn't win more, didn't win a playoff game. What we could do was still out there and I don't think we ever accomplished it. It's inexplicable, but the way they just laid waste to people - it's a source of pride, it's a source of pride for anybody who grew up here during the lean years. We really thought we had the dynasty in the making. They traded off some players and the next year that did not sit well for us but it's a great team. I think it makes you appreciate when a team does come together how they have the kind of success that that '85 Bears team had. If the Bears couldn't... that's part of their tragic and beautiful flaw that they... it was like this flower just boom boom and that was it. It wasn't coming back to next year but for that moment it was the most amazing flower, the most amazing display, most amazing NFL team that I've ever seen and the best. [narrator] The Bears had fallen short in their quest for a dynasty. While some of the '85 team moved on, the pride of their historic accomplishments had earned a permanent home in the second city. It was a great experience to play here in Chicago and finally win the Super Bowl and how we did it was pretty unique. I think they're the greatest team of all time because of the way they dominated. Well the 1985 Bears were a unique team for a lot of different reasons. I would say that the Bears of '85 '86 are number 1, 2, 3... 1 through 8 all-time best teams. The team was so good. It was so good - 91 to 10 was the score in the playoffs. ...because you have to consider the Bears of December, you have to consider the Super Bowl shuffle Bears... It was like fighting Mike Tyson back in his heyday. The fight was over before it even started. In the month of November they outscored their opponents 120 to 13. Gotta consider the preseason Bears... They just beat 'em to a pole... and we went through offenses like that. They all gotta be included. These guys stand there alone like kind of monuments to a great past that literally has not been duplicated. Who says who's the greatest? I mean you can't say it but to be one of the great teams that played in NFL history yeah I could agree with that. I would say that. On the biggest stage in the world there's been no other team that has won by that many points - no one even comes close to them. They have arguably the best defense and the best running back of all time. When I look at the Bears I look at greatness from a whole 'nother level. They were like the worst team you've ever seen and then they became the best team of all time. Not the greatest team. I'm not gonna say the greatest team... all the years I've been associated with the NFL just that '85 Bears defense was the best unit on the defensive side without question in my eyes - without question. I know there's numbers that support other ones, no no no no. The Bears. When you went out there you could get embarrassed. They could win the game by themselves for real. Whether or not we were the best or the greatest, who knows? That's for everybody else to decide. When I see John Madden he always said... gives a little smile and says 'you guys are the greatest team we ever saw.' And so if he says we're the greatest, who am I to argue with him? I'll do it like the president... [Obama impression] 'It is a bid deal.' [laughter in background] 'I love that team...' 'I was growing up in Hopper Arkansas.' 'We used to watch them all the time.' 'I love the Chicago Bears.' I absolutely do I agree with President Obama. Single best team to play football. The Bears won games in a dominant fashion I mean they didn't just squeak by... they trashed, they beat you up, they stomped on you, they walked away, we're the Chicago Bears, we're that good. That's how they won games. So whether they would beat the '72 dolphins or not... on head-to-head I don't know but I think the Bears defense would shine above everything else in that matchup and you would say that's the best thing in this football game. I can say without equivocation that the 1985 Bears, the Super Bowl champs, the one in January of '86 were the best single-season team that I think has ever been in the NFL. President Obama welcomed the Chicago Bears Super Bowl 20 championship team to the White House today. They won the title 25 years ago but weren't able to visit the White House because the space shuttle Challenger exploded just days after their victory. [President Obama] Ladies and gentlemen the greatest team in NFL history, the 1985 Chicago Bears. [audience applause and cheers] [barking in background] Richard dent told me hey you know I've been talking to Barack Obama you know we're gonna get to the White House and I was like 'what?' This is as much fun as I will have as president the United States right here. This is one of the perks of the job right here. After this team won the Super Bowl, it never had a chance to celebrate here in the White House. The moment for the Bears to visit the White House was postponed and the years went by but shortly after I took office someone at the NFL realized hey there's a Bears fan living in the White House. And so today I'm proud to say to the players, to the coaches, to the staff of the 1985 Bears, welcome to the White House for this well-deserved and long overdue recognition. [applause] The fact that Walter Payton wasn't there, Dave Duerson wasn't there, I think made it a little melancholy but I think everybody who was there was reminded of what a cultural force they had been. To be able to hear President of the United States talk passionately about your team and then looking out over, you know, towards the Washington Monument - it was a gorgeous day - it was just a great experience. To work in the White House, you know you'll run into world leaders, four-star generals, whoever, just on your way to the restroom so you try to act like you've been through it before, you act professional - but you know when the '85 Bears came to town I just kind of dropped all that and I ran across to the White House gift shop, bought this ball grabbed this sharpie for my assistant I went outside and just started asking all the guys they would sign this. We were excited because he really welcomed us with open arms he told us the entire house was ours, we could do what we want to - just don't tear things up. With zero pretense of being professional whatsoever and they were all super nice and they did. And he's talking about aw I know Richard, I know Otis... and he looked at me and he goes... and I thought he forgot my name. Oh gosh. And we were just taking pictures of everything and pictures near this painting and pictures in this library and pictures... I mean it was a lot of fun - and he goes I know Fencik and I go alright! If the white house goes up in flames this will be the one thing that I save out of my office. Some of you may remember that back in 2004 when I was running for the Senate some people were trying to draft Ditka to run against me. I will admit I was a little worried. He was very comical, had a good time meeting him and he knew who I was he said 'Willie Gault man you lucky you still could run and you were one of the fastest men ever...' so it was great. We had a great time it was great just to see all the people there and get together with the guys again. You know by the time we visited I think one of the moving things was the fact that you know Buddy Ryan came... Coach Ryan's 46 defense changed football forever. Nobody had ever seen anything like it, nobody knew what to do with it, and with the talent he had on the defensive side of the ball there wasn't anything other teams could do about it. Buddy Ryan was in pretty bad shape at that point but he had really been the engineer of that defense and you could tell how moved he was to be able to participate. This was the defense that set the standard and it is still the standard. This team changed everything for every team that came on after, on and off the field. They changed the laws of football. They were gritty, they were gutsy, they were hard-working, they were fun-loving, sort of how Chicagoans like to think of themselves. I think everybody who was there was reminded of what what a cultural force they had been not just for Chicago but ultimately for the country as a whole. And Chicago has always been a die-hard football town but this team did something to our city that we've never gotten over. We love the Bears. At the end of that trip wow we really appreciated the moment a lot more than we would have if we had done that six months after the original Super Bowl. Knowing that my grandparents were farmers and their parents were slaves, to be able to get to a white house and meet that first African-American president I was proud beyond belief and even though you know how busy the man is and within a very tight window... just proud to be at the white house Congratulations to all of you, thank you for helping to bring our city together. Stick around guys and enjoy yourselves but as I mentioned back there don't break anything and keep your eyes on McMahon. [laughter] Better teams come along that had better talent, but none had had the heart of the '85 Bears. It had been great for football and I think it'd been great for the city of Chicago. It was good for the country and for, you know, a young kid who was just starting off in a career of public service it was a great diversion and a way to keep me going and so I sure expressed how much I appreciated them. I think it just made the city, you know, the whole second city thing I don't think he ever heard of it anymore after that. I think people used to believe that that was true and I think that that was such a dominant event that I've never thought of Chicago as a second city ever again. I don't think a lot of people ever did again. I think what they did said, 'be careful, because we can do anything. Anything.'
