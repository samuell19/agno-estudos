(adventurous music) (men fighting) - Hey, listen buddy, can't you go somewhere else to fight? I don't want the police here. - Go on, give it to him. - Ole. - Hey, cut it out. - Hold this for me. (dramatic music) Later. - He comes here every night. We tried to throw him out yesterday. He lives on whiskey. - I bet he wants to take a trip. - Huh uh, not on LSD. - Then I don't understand what he wants, do you? - Well, that's the reason we brought you down here, to find out. - Hey, you. - Don't come crying on my shoulder. - You boys better be careful of tourists like him. - He's not a tourist. (men fighting) - Put her there. (woman screams) - Oh! - Sorry. - Listen, will you please take your coat back, put the whiskey away, and beat it? - Come here, hurry. ("Jo Walker" by Angelina Monti) - Bring it with him? - He's carrying a black bag. - I hope that's it. - Welcome to Istanbul, Captain Rowland. I'm Allan Hood. I'm NATO's military advisor. I work with the U.S. Armed Forces in Turkey. This is Miss Joyce Sellers, the secretary to the Consul General. - How do you do? - Is that it? - Yes, that's it. If you could help me get rid of this thing, I'd be grateful to you. - We can relieve you of it upstairs, this way. I hope you have a pleasant trip. - Oh yes, thank you. - Well, Captain Rowland, how do you like Istanbul? - The little I've seen coming in from the airport makes me want to see more of it. - Of course we can arrange that. It's no trouble at all. In fact, my brother George runs a tourist service. Joyce, would you phone him and ask if he would please set one of his prettiest girls aside for Captain Rowland? - Isn't the Consul General here? - He's to come back tomorrow. - Yes, he's attending a conference on next month's maneuvers. Could I interest you in a drink, Captain Rowland? - With pleasure, as soon as I'm rid of this case. - Well, why don't we have some of the Counsel General's whiskey. And we'll see what we can do about releasing you from your precious cargo, Captain Rowland. - I'm not in the habit of wearing jewelry. - I hope it wasn't too annoying. I'll open the safe for you. - Mr. Hood, does anyone know the combination besides yourself? - Only the Consul General. Okay Captain, I opened it. - Well, here you are, sir. Best wishes from the Pentagon. - But is it really true that it's worth over a million dollars? - Yes. If you'd mix this flask of LSD with drinking water of a major metropolis, you could have the whole population of a city completely paralyzed for as long as 24 hours. - What's the Army going to do with so much LSD? - Every important nation keeps a supply of it on hand. Joyce, put this in the safe. Thank you. We live in an age of such unconventional warfare it's terrifying. If another war should break out, the enemy could demoralize our people with LSD. - [Rowland] I see. And how long will you keep the flask here? - I believe that at the embassy's next reception the LSD will be handed over to the American commander in Turkey. - I see. - I'm sorry, sir, but unless you want to try some of your drinks, you should lock the safe. (traditional dance music) - Cheers. - Give me a glass of water. - And done for me, too. - Miss Jenny Carter? - [Bartender] Water? - Yes. Who are you? - I'm Jo Walker. - What do you want? - Oh, I thought I might just go home with you, that's all. - Police again? - Do I look like a cop to you? - Okay, just a minute. - I'd like a scotch, please. - You're a friend of Jenny's? - Well, I'm her friend as far as I know. - After the LSD? - Oh, I think I'd better stick to scotch, thank you. Here's to you. - Listen pal, you're making a mistake. LSD's tremendous for the intellect. You see things with sensitivity. Life takes on meanings you never knew it had. - Why is it so peculiar that he asked for me? I know what he wants. They all want the same thing. What's so special about one more guy? - Did he ask any questions about the Green Hounds? - Uh, I think he wanted some information about our supply of LSD. - He's from the narcotics squad. - Then it's obvious what has to be done. I may have to do it myself. You can help me, Jenny. Get him for us. - Why, what are you going to do with him? - That's none of your business. Khemal will send him on a trip, and after a while he'll forget you, and he'll forget where he met you. Oh yes, there is one thing you can do for us. You can see to it that he orders another whiskey. And as for Mr. Shapiro, he'll figure out a way to load it with LSD. - Okay kid, let's go. - Listen, Joyce, you're not-- - Oh, I know Khemal, you're supposed to replace the boss when he's not here, aren't you. You're absolutely right to use LSD. What a clever idea to put it in his whiskey. - But that isn't-- - Shh. Last week a tourist who was on top of a minaret took LSD and jumped to his death. Let's hope our man does the same. - Well? - You know, Mr. Walker, I think I'm beginning to like it. It's not a bad substitute. - There's nothing funny about it, Jenny. You're better off drinking whiskey than drugging yourself with LSD. It's much cheaper, anyway. - You do have a point there. - I hope my advice has some effect. Come on. - Just a minute, pal. I'm sorry to interrupt your little date, but you're coming with us. - What do you want? - I'm asking the questions, buddy, and I'm not in any mood to play around. First I want you to tell us how much you know. - But listen, Khemal didn't say you should-- - Leave it to me. - Look, don't you realize you've got the Green Hounds on his neck? - But all night long that jerk has been bothering me. He's a pest. - We'll have to get the poor guy out of here. It's dangerous. - Why? They want to send him on a trip for a while, that's all. - It's not a round trip they have in mind. You know they took my brother on one of those trips, don't you? And my brother was killed by those men. He knew too much for his own good. - Well I told you, we were just going to have a drink somewhere else, that's all. - You expect us to believe that? Come on now. I still haven't forgotten your playful caper last night. - Hold it. - What do you want us to do with him? - When I get to the bar, pull that switch. It puts the lights out. - Now put away the gun, mister. When a person's under the influence of LSD, he has no control. Your whiskey was loaded with LSD. - Don't move or I'll kill you. You take another step, and I'll kill you. - You've made a mistake, Mr. Walker. You've underestimated the Green Hounds. (men laughing) - Come with me. - She'll pay for that. - Look, forget it. There are more important things to do. - Shapiro, go after them. - Khemal, will you stop worrying about a little scratch and get going? - I can't go, I can't. - They're opening the bridge. If we can get to the other side, we'll be safe. Come on. (tense music) - [Joyce] Someone's coming. - [Man] Who is it? - It's George's car in the driveway. - [Man] What's he doing here in the middle of the night? - He drops in whenever he likes. He probably stopped because of my car. He's with that girl who's showing Istanbul to Captain Rowland. - [Man] We mustn't be seen here. Hurry up. - George just came in with a girl. They're in the hall. - My brother has his office here, and the Consul's secretary is a very good friend of mine. That was her car in the driveway, so I suppose she's here. - Mr. Hood, I think I'd better wait outside. - No, you stay right here. I'll be back in a minute, it's okay. Joyce? It's George. Joyce? Why doesn't she answer? (grunts) - I knew it. That fool Khemal let her go. - George will tell us where we can find her. - Right at our feet lies Istanbul, with its graceful minarets rising into the sky, and those classic cupolas you see were once the delight of sultans and pashas. And over there, rising above the city, are the turrets of the citadel Roumeli Hissar, which have withstood centuries of attacks. - Huh, well. - Are you happy with what you see, Captain Rowland? - Oh, yes. Quite a lovely sight. What you said about the citadel, you said it's often been under attack. - Sure, hordes of men have attacked the citadel, but they couldn't take it. Oh, I hope you don't mind, these shoes are killing me. I'm going to take them off. - Hold it, will you. Right there. - Weren't you hoping that you'd find an old friend? - Oh, I'd much rather be alone with you. Besides, he hasn't shown up at his hotel for three days. - I hope nothing's happened to him. - He drinks like a fish, so he's probably just getting over a hangover somewhere. And I ought to get in the panorama. - Did you lose a shoe, miss? - Oh, thank you. (gasps) - I won't be long, just another minute. - Hello. - Howdy, Jo. Jo? Leyla! - You think I frightened the poor girl? - Oh, of course not. It's natural to see people rising up from the dead. It happens all the time. - What do you know about LSD? - What's wrong, Jo, you don't look well. - You ever take a trip with LSD? - Yeah, course I have. I came here with over a million dollars worth. - No, I mean take the stuff. - I know, I know what a trip is. - It was the worst thing I've ever gone through. I've been drugged. Ever since, I've been dodging the Green Hounds. - Green Hounds? - Yeah. Got a cigarette? - Listen, aren't you exaggerating a little? Maybe you'd better go over to the faucet and wash up. Come back, and we'll hear the rest of this Green Hound story. - I would be kind of a (moans). - Mr. Rowland. - Yes, what is it? - A minute ago I was eavesdropping on you. Jo wasn't making it up, about the Green Hounds. It's true, the Green Hounds exist. - Thanks for backing me up, miss. Of course, you'd prefer to think that I was drunk again, wouldn't you? - Well, it's happened before. - We better get out of here. You're about to find out what a Green Hound looks like. Hurry! Oh, my head. - Well, you ought to go back to the hotel and clean up. - Yeah, sure. - When you're feeling better, I'd get to a doctor. He'll know how to put you back on your feet again. You know a doctor, Leyla? - Yes, I do, a personal friend. He'll take good care of him, I'm sure. - I've got to get to the airport. The Consul's coming and I'm supposed to meet his plane. I'll see you after that at Leyla's. - Okay. - Sure, uh, well where do you live? - You won't have any difficulty getting there. You just cross the Galata Bridge up to where the house boats are and jump onto the one that's called Leyla, okay? - Leyla. (dramatic music) Jenny, Jenny, what's wrong? Jenny, listen. - Okay, copper, leave her alone. She's off on a trip. Only this time it's final. You'll read about her in the headlines tomorrow. - A man with your talents should join a sideshow, mister uh ... - Eddie Shapiro. San Francisco, USA. Of course, to my pals it's Little Sharpie. - Jo Walker, New York, USA. At home I'm known as Commissar X. - Now isn't that funny. Only the joke is on you, Commissar X. - I guess we must have misunderstood each other. I wanted to make a date with her, that's all there was too it. - Don't pull that stuff on me. I'm here to find out who you're working for. - The Boy Scouts. Every day we're supposed to someone a good deed. - Your humor leaves me completely cold. We're not playing games. - Listen, uh, I think you're overestimating me. I'm not as important as you think. - You won't find your pistol in that drawer. I took it out. I think you'd better spill it. Otherwise, you'll end up on a trip like the girl. - What have you done to her? - The Green Hounds don't appreciate stupid questions. Let me show you something. Trying to make it look as if I drugged her, huh, Shapiro? - You catch on quick. You attacked her, she murdered you, and committed suicide with LSD. How to get rid of two birds with one stone. - Well, there's no point in murdering two of us. Leave Jenny out of this. - I'll make all the decision, cop. Hey, what are you doing? - I think I'll shave now, if you don't mind. - What good'll that do? - I'll be honest with you, Shapiro. I've been paid a lot to get Jenny, and if you help me out I'll split the money with you. You'll make just as much as I do, and you won't have to keep bothering everybody. - You want to know something? The Chief has arranged a really big deal. LSD worth over a million dollars. Anyone who know as much will end up in a coffin. And you know too much for your own good. - Tell me, how much you going to get out of it? 5,000? - 3,000, why? - What? I'm surprised you'd work for so little. I'd give you 5,000 if you'll do it. - Sure, let me see the money first. - You agree to it? - If you have the money, where is it? - It's right there, in the aquarium. - Then get it. - I should? - Yeah, you. Hurry up, stop stalling. - For a West Coast gangster, you're pretty stupid. A friend of mine kept a revolver in his aquarium, and he had-- - Okay, hold it, hold it. You finish your shave. I'll get it myself. So where is it. Uh, it's buried in the sand, on the other side. Under those rocks there. (yelling) Hey, I didn't know you were an expert. I don't dance. I'd join you but, my heart, you know. - What about her? - Let's kill her before somebody calls Inspector Rebat. (footsteps approaching) - [Woman] Your suit, Mr. Walker. - Come on, let's get out of here. - But we're terribly-- (overlapping talking) - But you'll have to be patient til we find him. - We're just going to have lunch on the deck. - A safety precautions not to let anyone out of this hotel. - There is his. - There he goes! (adventurous music) This way. (tires squealing) - There he is! He'd have to use those steps down there, come on. - Come on. - Do you know that fellow? - He looked a lot like someone I know. - I thought you told me a while ago that the man was an American citizen. - Why yes, but I could be mistaken. - You keep out of this. We don't need assistance, do you understand? - Who is this guy, the local garbage collector? - I'd like you to meet Inspector Rebat. Captain Rowland, attached to the New York Police Department. - And the Consul General might have heard it, sir, that the Chief of the Police Department of Istanbul cannot be addressed in that way. This is our business. Captain Rowland is welcome as a private citizen only. You have no official authority in Turkey. - I knew all along you weren't a garbage collector. - What did you want that man for, Inspector? - We arrived just as he was about to commit a murder, Mr. Hood. - Hmm. - I was told he is an American citizen. - Well, the man's a private detective. His name is Jo Walker, and he's from New York. However, there's very little chance of his escaping. My men will soon place him under arrest. - I hope so. (slow jazz music) - Your first bath, how do you like it? Looks like a visitor on the Leyla, huh? - I thought you told me if I jumped off the Galata Bridge I'd land right on your house boat. - That was just a manner of speaking. And by the way, I'm not used to visitors at this hour. - Well, that's not important. Can I help you with anything there? (footsteps) - The police are outside, Leyla. - The police are here, searching the boats? Are they after you? - Me? No, why do you say that? - You ought to hide your friend there. - Where can I hide you? There's no place to go. - Is this boat yours? - No, it's not, but the owner's inside. In her bathtub. - The police don't care. - What are you doing here? Look the other way. Now what do you want? - Did a man just come in here? - What do you mean? Visitors while I'm in my bath? I assure you, gentlemen, I'm not the kind of girl that allows such intimacies. - The man we're after attacked one girl already. He could be a killer. Don't take chances, the fellow is dangerous. - Will you please get out of here? - But I didn't touch her. Ah, oo, stop it, I'm going, just a second. A gun. - A nice girl isn't safe with you. - Believe it or not, I'm innocent. - Let's hear it, then. - Well, it won't make sense, but the girl was nude on the bed when I arrived. What was I supposed to do? - You were right, it doesn't make sense. - It was the same situation you're in now. - No wonder you've got the police chasing you. - I don't get it. I suppose you mean you're afraid of me. - It's natural for a girl not to trust a stranger. - A stranger? Oh now, you can't call me a stranger, especially since we took a bath together. - Mr. Walker, I'd appreciate your turning the other way until I'm dressed. - Lunch time, Bruno. Take it easy. - Tell me, who's the man on the deck of that houseboat next to yours? - Oh, that's Almann. He's the one who's going to take care of you. - I'm afraid she can't be questioned for at least 24 hours. In fact, we'll be lucky if she lives that long. She's in critical condition. It's a result of an overdose of drugs, I'd say. - LSD? - Very likely. - Ah, we're having a lot of trouble controlling LSD, almost as much as they've had in the States. We're doing all we can to keep it out of Turkey, but we're up against an international syndicate. You said she was American, didn't you? - Yes. Her name is Jenny Carter. We'll see if she knows anything that might help us stop this traffic. - If any problems arise, you know my office, I'll be happy to help. What was her relationship to that detective, was there anything between them? - I don't know yet. We'll find out as soon as we get our hands on him. - One good shot of this stuff is the best cure there is for an acid hangover. You ready? - How many of these injections have you given? - Just bend over, will you? I used to work for a vet in the mountains of Tennessee, and in all those years I never had a single complaint. Never had an animal die, either. (grunts) Perfect. Did you feel anything? You know, experience counts in that game. Every day, I did 200 of those poor little animals. I'm mighty proud of that. - I take it you never studied medicine. - Why, no, but I vaccinated plenty of cows. (Tom chuckles) You'll feel a whole lot better half an hour from now. And if you don't, you come around for another one. - [Jo] Oh, I'll feel better, don't you worry. - All of us in the harbor use Dr. Almann. Whenever there's a sick pet, he comes around with his needle. - I always like a man who's got a way with animals. - George give you much trouble? - He got very talkative when he saw the rats. What do we do with Leyla? She knows too much, too. - Yeah, she'll have to be put away. - We've had those weasels in our neighborhood for over an hour. If you can keep quiet, we'll find out what they're up to. - We can't touch her while she's on her own boat. She's too well protected by fishermen. - You're right, it wouldn't pay to mess with them. How 'bout getting her somewhere in town? - [Eddie] The boss has it all figured out. We'll get her tomorrow. - [Thug] Yeah, how? - [Eddie] Every morning she guides tourists around Istanbul. Tomorrow morning, she'll walk right into our little trap. - I'm on the trail of an organization that's smuggling LSD in from the States. It's dangerous not only for the people in Turkey, but it also might be employed against our armed forces. - So that's it, someone wants to break up NATO's defense network. - It's no laughing matter, Jo. They stole enough LSD to gain complete control over our installation here for a long time. - Well there's only one thing I don't understand. You've made no effort to get it back from the men who took it. - But there wasn't any LSD in the bottle they stole. I made sure of that. Up until now they haven't found out about it. But when they do, they'll be out looking for me. You see, they'll know right away I've got the bottle, because they have too many well-paid informers. - Now I'm beginning to see what Shapiro was so excited about. He told me they had a fortune. - If you want to see your friend leaving, look out the window. Shapiro's out there. The Green Hounds found out where you are. They want to kill you. - Kill me? How did they find out that I'm here? - It might have been from George Hood. - No doubt about that. - Where did you get that? - Straight from Shapiro. Whole conversation. Listen to it. I'll leave it with you. - [Eddie On Tape] The boss has it all figured out. We'll get her tomorrow. - [Thug On Tape] Yeah, how? - [Eddie On Tape] Every morning, she guides tourists around Istanbul. Tomorrow morning, she'll walk right into our little trap. - The doctor is lowering a briefcase into the water. - Now listen Bruno, I don't want you to untie that knot. Don't touch it, do you hear me? - I'll have a look. Ah! - Almann's right, Leyla. You better clear out. I don't want you guiding tourists tomorrow. - My advice is to make your rounds as usual. - Are you out of your mind? - We'll have a chance to find out who the Green Hounds are. We can surround Leyla so she won't get hurt. I think it's the best way of handling it. - It's too risky. - I think he's right. As long as you protect me, it's a lot better than being holed up here. I think it's a good idea. - I don't like it. What about asking if Inspector Rebat'd help us? - I'll speak to the inspector about that. Also about Jenny. They'd like to get her out of the way, too. - The Consul's secretary, don't forget about her. - Okay, but how are we going to get rid of those jerks outside? They're sure to see us leaving here together. - Get your things, Leyla. You're coming to my place. (Turkish folk music) (crowd applauding) - Inspector Rebat hasn't talked to Jenny yet. They want to take her to a clinic. Up until now, she's still in a coma. But tomorrow she'll be able to talk. - What does she know? - Enough to put the Green Hounds out of business for good. The Inspector will enjoy pouncing on us. - She won't say a thing. (dramatic music) (gasps) - What are you doing here? (muffled struggling) (gun firing) (tense music) (yells wordlessly in pain) (nurse gasps) - Come on, let's go. - What about the girl? (police whistle blowing) - Let them go. Come on, give me a hand. (traditional dance music) - She's very pretty. - Uh huh, very. - Watch this. You look just like some oriental pasha, Captain. - You might add her to your harem. - Miss Sellers, there's a phone call for you. - Will you excuse me, please. But how did it happen, then? Sure, I believe you, but this thing has got to be done now. There's no more time. You stay where you are. It shouldn't take me a minute. - Captain, will you excuse me? - Sure. - Joyce, what's the matter? Anything wrong? Where are you going? - It's urgent that I go now. I'll explain tomorrow. (dramatic music) Bumblers. How could you? Just when everything was beginning to fall into place. If that girl so much as opens her mouth, it's the end of everything. If we don't deliver the LSD to the Valley of a Thousand Hills tomorrow, a million dollars are gone. - For the Chief, not for us, though. - For all of us. Look, we have to see that someone keeps Jenny Carter from talking, and you can do that better than anyone else. - Yeah, we'll I'm not doing it alone. I need Shapiro's help. - Oh yeah? That clinic will be swarming with policemen. It's too big a risk. - But they won't even know you're there. - Good trick, if you're invisible. You know it won't work. You can count me out. - Don't give me that. (beeping) Did anybody follow you? - I suppose it's Captain Rowland. Welcome to the secret headquarters of the Green Hounds, Captain Rowland. We didn't expect you so soon. That's enough for a start. - As Consul General, I know you are covered by diplomatic immunity, but I wish you would tell me the truth. - I'm not sure I follow you. - Our agents have discovered certain peculiarities, dare I say indiscretions, regarding the movements of your secretary, Miss Sellers. Can you tell me what they mean? - In any questions regarding my personal life, I'd be more than happy to oblige you, but where my position in the foreign service is concerned, I'm bound to secrecy. - I understand. - You mentioned my secretary, however. It wouldn't surprise me to find she's guilty of certain indiscretions, such as spending time with various unsavory characters. Surely that must sound very strange coming from a career diplomat. - Well, I have heard that intelligence agents often seek out strange bedfellows, at least in all the novels. Is there any truth in what I have heard, or am I to consider the girl innocent? - [Consul] I have reason to believe it's quite true. - What? And in spite of it you still keep her on as your secretary? - She is my step-daughter. - Well, I assure you, I didn't expect to hear that, sir. - Are you Rebat? - Inspector Rebat. And just who are you? - Jo Walker, and I object to the way that I have been treated in your country. And I'm warning you, if this gorilla doesn't let go of me immediately, he's going to be sorry. - Eh. - I told them to arrest you, Mr. Walker. - My God, Inspector, how dare you sit there quietly talking and let the real criminals walk into Jenny's room where they tried to murder her! - Is that true? - I meant to tell you-- - Listen, Inspector, I want you to see to it that she's moved out of there right away. - I'll take care of it as soon as I've talked to your Consul. - Oh, I wouldn't bother the Consul if I were you, because if that idiot had done his job when he should, nobody would have gotten anywhere near the girl. In fact, your own men aren't much when it comes to intelligence. He dismissed the guards which were stationed outside the door of Jenny's room. - Well, I was going to-- - Get going. - Distracted with all those nurses, and, uh ... - Who are you? - The idiot. - Well, then make yourself useful for once. I want you to call the hospital as soon as you can and tell them not to permit anyone near the room of Jenny Carter, if that's not too much to ask of a Consul General. - Whatever you say, sir. Mr. Walker, it certainly has been a pleasure meeting you. - [Khemal] Bring it down. Slowly, slowly. Easy. That's it. Hold it. Let's go. Come on, up with it. More on the left. - [Eddie] Don't forget, it's the sixth floor, 12th window from the right, got it? - As soon as you drop me off, take it up and bring it back 30 seconds later. (siren wailing) I got inside. Take it up, a little more. A little more. Yeah, fine. (tense music) - I bet they don't stay sick long with you around. - Go on. (screams) (men fighting) - [Eddie] Hey, we've got to beat it. The cops are here. - You'll have a beautiful view of the dome of St. Sophia from here, and there's the Hippodrome. St. Sophia's usually thought of as the first major Christian church, since it was constructed a thousand years before the Church of St. Peter in Rome. Later on, you'll have a chance to tour the inside of the mosque. - Lemonade, ice cold lemonade. Thank you. - Hello? Can you hear me? What's going on there, lemonade? - Any more customers? Ice cold lemonade here. - Inspector? They didn't show up yet. How long will it take them to get here? - They'll be there any minute now. They left the mosque. Listen, Walker, stay right where you are until they arrive. - We'll be ready for them when they get here, Inspector. - Shoe shine? - No. Hey. Listen, I said no. - Be done in a second. - I tell your fortune by your height. Let me see how tall you are. - A man just arrived. He's approaching her, but I can't tell who. He's walking straight for the tourist group. - [Leyla] On the right is the Mosque of Ahmed, also called the Blue Mosque. - It's Allan Hood. Bring him here, and hurry. - Be glad to. - This is the main entrance. If you will just follow the path, you'll get the best view of the gardens. - Miss Kessler. I'm Allan Hood. You know, George's brother. - Oh, yes. George mentioned you the other day. - Well, he asked me to get in touch with you. Since the police are behind the whole investigation, I-- - Not only behind, all around. - Oh, really? - Inspector Rebat wants to speak to you. - What do you mean? What is this? - Nothing new there? Good. You will continue with Operation Tourist as planned, right. That's all. Well, Mr. Hood, I advise you to leave your brother to the authorities. We'll get in touch with you when we've located him. - The way I see it, we're both looking for my brother, but for different reasons, Inspector. You think of George as a criminal. You're mistaken to believe that. If he's got something to do with it, it's only because he's fallen into a trap. - I'm sorry, but we were obliged to keep you away from Miss Kessler. You see, she's already given the police all the information she could. - I found out where Miss Kessler was without your help. I'd be surprised if I couldn't find out a lot more without you. I wish you luck. - But listen ... - No use talking to him, Mr. Walker. At 10:32, we have to alert Operation Tourist to go into action. - The Bosphorus is the link between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. That tower is where (indistinct) according to the famous legend. - He tricked us. Nothing but common sugar in this bottle. - No, don't do that. It's hard on the rug. And besides, you're wasting it. There's lots of energy in sugar. - You think I need energy, eh? (grunting) Shapiro, tell the boys I want to see them for a minute. - I have an urgent message for Sgt. Ozkan. - This is Sgt. Ozkan, what do you want? - There's been a change of plans. Operation Tourist has been called off. We've been instructed to take you back to headquarters. That's all. - All right, pull up alongside. - Something's wrong, or I'm sure the Inspector's plans wouldn't have changed. - That's peculiar. What do you think it is? - Well, it sounds like he's found Rowland. - It might be another trap. - No one could possibly know the Inspector's codeword, tourist. Come on, Leyla. - May I come along with you? - Of course. - Thanks. - They're all onboard the patrol boat. - What was Inspector Rebat's reason for calling this whole thing off? - I don't know about him, but the boss is anxious to talk to you, Commissar X. - They tricked us! - She's going to pay for it if you don't stop. - I'm coming back to shore. - In the old days, they used to turn the lions loose on Christians here, but today we're using rats (chuckles). (gate squeaking open) (Leyla gasps) - Where's my brother, George? - You'll find all that remains of your brother if you look around, next to the pretty cigarette girl. - There's a boat approaching the tower. I think it's Almann. - We have to get them to talk. - Listen Captain, if you want to save your friends from an unpleasant death, then tell us what you've done with the LSD. Let's go. - So you see it depends on you, Captain. Where's the LSD? - You probably were followed. - I wish you'd let me take care of him. We have an old score to settle. - Okay, as long as you take him downstairs when you're done. - Right, let's go. (Leyla screams) (jug shatters) - My God, it's Gisela. - Rats. - You're all right. - Rats. - Take it easy. Easy does it. - Hold it, get your hands up. Watch it. You could have a bad fall from here. - If anybody falls, it'll be you. - You're mistaken. Can't say I didn't warn you. Ow! (man screams) (man screams) - The best thing to do is to give in. You might save the girls if you tell them where the LSD is. - Maybe you're right. But only if I tell it to their boss. - [Allan] What if it's just another trick? What if they don't intend to let us go once they have this stuff? We'll all end up like my brother. - [Rowland] I better not try it. - Hey, it's the fishermen. We'd better get out of here, those guys are dangerous. Cat-ma-ler-tak customers, there's too many of them for us. - Put the prisoners on the boat. - Yeah. - Abdul, try to keep the fishermen here for as long as you can, then meet me in the Valley of a Thousand Hills. (man screams) Captain, you're in luck. We're taking you to the camp of the Green Hounds, now get to it. You two, get the other prisoners up here right away. I don't have room for you all. Leave the two cops with the rats. Open the glass door. - Come on, try the elevator cage. (man laughs) (gun clicks) Of all times. (gun fires) (man screams) Well done. Almann, you're a pretty good shot. - Ah, I worked in a vaudeville act called William Tell Jr. Where's Leyla? - They took her with them. Listen, I'm all for getting out of here. How about you? - Shapiro, do you think they can catch us? - We'll outmaneuver those tugs any day. - After having examined the reports, the General took the following decision regarding the LSD. It's essential that the drug not be allowed to fall into the hands of this criminal organization, whatever the cost involved. In other words, the LSD must be returned to us, even if it means the loss of human lives. - We're all under an obligation to assist NATO in recovering this dangerous drug, and will follow the General's instructions to the letter. - Colonel, we don't have to worry about either Mr. Hood or Captain Rowland. They're quite used to this sort of thing. But there are two other prisoners that are concerned. One is a girl whose brother they killed. And the other, the girl who was present when the criminals were looting the safe here. Your Excellency, you can't expect us to cooperate if these two lives are in danger. - In this case, the military authorities have the last word. I have to cooperate. - Perhaps the military authorities underestimate the danger the two girls are in. - Did you know that your own secretary belongs to this organization? - You've no proof, have you? - No sir, not yet. But I will have when I discover their headquarters. - And that's impossible, I'm afraid. - Excuse me for interrupting you gentlemen, but I'm the kind who enjoys poking around. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I knew where the camp was located. - Well? - Of course, I could be wrong. - That's not important. Right or wrong, we've got to try every angle. So? - I'll tell you what I know. At the beginning of the 13th century, Murad, the eldest son of the Sultan Osman was envious of his father's throne. In order to get it, he hired a gang of barbarians called the Green Hounds. However, the Sultan found out. Murad was banished with the savages to the desert. Even now, the descendants of Murad as well as the Green Hounds live there, like their barbarian ancestors in holes in the ground. - Yes. - I learned of it while working for Miss Kessler's father, who was a professor of mine. At that time I was studying archaeology at the university. - Could you show us where this region is? - Sure. You see, it isn't far from here at all. The Valley of the Thousand Hills is what they call it. (adventurous music) - Hungry? Sure. - Hey, Almann, you know that old Sultan must have really meant business to put his son in a place like this. - Yeah. - In that disguise I'd never know you. - I wonder. Let's hope the natives don't recognize us, either. Watch it, she has a tendency to rear up when anything's behind her. - The way you explained it, we can't have much farther to go, huh? - We'll be on top of their camp in half an hour, the way I-- (men groaning) - Okay, Captain, where is our LSD? Where? - You won't know (spits) til you set the others free. - I instructed the Green Hounds to get the LSD to me by midnight tonight. - Did you hear that? Rattan leaves in a few hours. You're going to talk, and if you don't, you'll see the girls put to death. - I bet he'll never talk anyhow. - Oh no? Listen, the boss has a great idea. - You don't think it will work, though? - You shouldn't have to ask. The boss always succeeds. But right now, I've got to hold Mr. Rattan's hand for an hour or so. You take care of those two until I'm through. - Can we get out that way? - Yes, but I'll have to knock off the guards first. - Should we follow you? - No, we can't go til midnight. - Why don't we try to get out of here before midnight? - Maybe, but it's still pretty light outside. We'd better wait til it's dark. - I'll help you with the guards. - No, I'd feel better if you'd stay with the girls. - Okay. - If you don't come back, what'll happen to us, Tom? - Don't worry, I'll be back. And if I don't make it, the LSD is hidden right in my hotel room. (men fighting) So you're the boss, eh? (Allan chuckles) - It took you a long time to learn the game. - You put on a pretty good act. - A few scratches are a small enough price to pay when you know you're going to win. - You even gambled with your brother's life. - Captain, perhaps if he hadn't barged into the room as I took the LSD from the safe, he'd still be alive. I had no choice. - Looks as if our friend Hood tricked Tom into telling him where to find the LSD. - What do we do about the girls? - Well, first of all we better find out where Hood keeps his prisoners. It must be near here. - How can we help the captain? - We must get a little closer. Let's have a look. - I'll be back with the LSD in less than half an hour. Joyce, you come along with me. Shapiro, you follow us with the other car. I don't think the captain would lie to me, however we'll soon see. - Well, I'm not going to wait any more than two hours. - All right, take him to the car. - Okay, come on. - You start a fight, they'll murder him. - Without this knife, he's going to be in a lot worse predicament than that. At last I've found you, you son of a snake! Where's Leyla? - A hundred yards south of here. - What's wrong with you? - He's the one who killed my sister and her husband. He will die for that. I must have my revenge! - Get in, hurry up. They can't be too far ahead of us. Go on. - [Khemal] Of all the luck. - Can't you even-- - Oh, there's Shapiro. Hold it! Come on, get out. We'll switch cars. Change the tire first. And catch up to us as fast as you can. Joyce, come on. - Go on, get in. Get the spare out of the trunk. - Here. Hold this, huh? - [Shapiro] Hey, can't you hurry it up? We haven't got all day. - Check the brakes, will ya? Throw it into gear. (horn honks) You idiot! - Hey, ain't you finished yet? - One more nut to be screwed on, that's all. - Here's the wrench. - Thanks. - So long. - Salaam. I'll give you 40 piasters for your instrument, son. No, I'll even make it 50. Huh? - Hey, what do you want that for? - Leyla once taught me her father's favorite folk song. If she hears it, she'll know I'm looking for her. - That's worth a try. - It's one way of finding out where she is. (Almann singing folk song) - Get back in there, go on. - We must try to signal him. - Let's see, how about something ... Unfasten this. - Hey, why don't you come talk to me, I'm bored. Oh, you look silly with that gun. Leave it here and come in where it's cool, huh? (Almann singing folk song) - Ah, it wasn't such a good idea after all. - Hey, didn't you see her waving her brassiere up there on the hillside? - Her what? - Pretty clever idea. That Leyla's not so dumb, huh? Listen, you get hold of Inspector Rebat and tell him what's going on here. I'll see if I can get up to the girls and tell them not to worry. - Okay. - They were headed that way when they disappeared. One of them was the American that got away from us in the citadel. Come on, after them. (electronic humming) - Inspector Rebat, Almann here. Inspector Rebat. This is Almann calling from the Valley of the Thousand Hills. Inspector, can you hear me? - You're wasting your breath. So it was you, Almann. Give me that. Hand it over. (men fighting) (gun firing) (horse whinnying) (gun firing) (folk music) - Mr. Rattan. I'm sorry I had to keep you. Now all that remains is the matter of the money. - It's a good thing you got here. I wasn't prepared to wait for you any longer. - You've earned a celebration. There's lots to eat and drink for everyone! (men cheering) - What are you doing there? - It is the safest way to get the drug over the border. - I'm sure they didn't see it. - Oh Gisela, they'll find us. I'd like to know what's happening. Since I signaled Almann, those two guards have gone. - Shapiro's coming. - Shapiro! We'll fix him. - Get ready. (women laughing) Here comes another one. Let's leave him here. Hurry, Leyla. - Okay. - Leyla. - It's Commissar X. Oh, we're sorry, we didn't know who you were. We're sorry. - Oh, I found this drying outdoors, I thought you might have some use for it. - Oh, your head hurts, doesn't it? - It sure does. - You can't play sheik with only two girls, it takes more than that to start a harem. - Oh, pardon me, I thought that's how it's done in the desert. - Uh oh, let's get out of here. The drunks are coming after the girls now. - That cave looks like a good place. Almann's dead. I don't know if he got in touch with the Inspector, or if they got to him first. - That means we'll have to escape by ourselves, huh? - I guess so, but we'll have a rough time of it, especially with the girls. (men shouting in distance) - They must have discovered the girls are missing. - This was Almann's rifle. He'd have been glad to see you use it. - I'd like to know who counted the thousand hills here. There must be at least 10,000. 10,000 hiding places until the Inspector arrives. - If he does. I doubt it. - We expect to hear from them very soon, Colonel. - I'd like to help the Inspector out, but you've been expecting your news all morning. The order you made requesting assistance has been on my desk for hours. It's only a matter of signing it. But I need men for a NATO maneuver, too. Not many are left. I'm sorry I can't help you. It's just too late. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (men yelling) - Those are Rebat's men. - But look, Allan's trying to escape with Joyce. - Here comes Khemal. He's bringing a pack of Green Hounds. - Maybe it's about time I took care of my friend Hood. - You're not safe here, go back inside. (grenades exploding) (men coughing) (men grunting) (man screaming) (man screaming) - Where is he? - Here I am. - That's all, Rowland, your number's up. (Tom chuckles) - You see? You should always look where you, oop! (men fighting) (Khemal laughs) - It's over with, Captain. All right, Captain. I'll kill you. (dramatic music) - Come on, Allan, let's go. - Get in. - Hurry. (men fighting) (hoof beats approaching) - Come on. - Hey, come back here. - Come back. There's another one, get him. - Thanks, Apache. (gun firing) - Hey Jo, wait for me. - Hurry it up. - We're out of ammunition. - Doesn't matter, they're too far away. - Come on, Jo. - We're almost out of the valley. (horn honking) What's that? - Well, whoever thought up the idea of using melons deserves a gold medal. Was it your idea, young lady? - The melon idea? No sir, he thought of it. - Then he gets the medal, the champion bowler. - I bet he'd rather have a carrot. (both laughing) - [Mule Voiceover] Not a bad idea, Captain Rowland. Make that a 24 "carrot" gold medal. ("Jo Walker" by Angelina Monti)
