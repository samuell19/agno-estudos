A film by The Alchemised Dollars starring You should know when it's enough. written and directed by There's peace here, order and tranquility. What did you say? Yeah, public safety is just perfect. I said the public safety was perfect here. "No entry" "Danger! High voltage!" This is the 27th time I'm calling you. And it's either busy or gets forwarded to your mom. To your mom! And she can't hear it. She can't hear it. On duty. What were you thinking? Cs?pi is not here. He got banned, we haven't talked since. We haven't talked. Now we're trying, but you can't hear me. Of course. He smashed the Kicsali Inn to pieces. It was self defense. Kicsali! I can't shout any louder, it's confidential. No one is hearing. Nor are you, that's the problem. He's a jackass. I could also smash it, but I don't. Depends on one's intelligence. I'm alright, apart from my hernia. No, it just hurts. Okay then, kisses. "All kisses hurt still" Start it up! Come on! Are the police after you? Don't think so. Had no issues? I got spotted. What?! I got spotted! Buzz off then! Don't ditch me! Is that you, B?la? I was thinking if I should be after carps or basses. - So you're doing fine? - Yeah. I have one problem. Cs?pi. Come on, leave me alone. You know his blood pressure is high. You know it as well as I do: He's healthy as a horse. Tell you what: He's not my type. I dislike working with gangsters. So long. What was the point in that? Attention! Magpie calling everyone. Maj. Kardos's service vehicle has been stolen. The culprit must still be in the vicinity of Balatonf?red. - Any word on this? - Yes. You should've returned ...the radio upon discharge. - The radio was rolled out along with me. - Look at that! - I won't. - Go catch them! - I've got hypertension. Cs?pi! Someone's after us. He's still here! Sir! Slapping melons or women is against the rules. I'll get you some sample. Next time, buddy! Hi Johann! I want to buy a camcorder, can you help? - Sure, we'll talk later. - Cheers! Seatbelt not fastened. HUF 300. You're not from around here, right? Right, we came from Szombathely to help out. HUF 300 or prosecution. Seatbelts must be fastened at all times. Disregarding the road safety regulations is a criminal offense. Either fine me or reprove me, doing both is not okay. ?tv?s, you gone crazy? Flying around like some mental griffin, what were you thinking? - Kardos's car... - I know! Look at me when I'm talking to you. Listen, ?tv?s. I've always been telling the truth. We don't need lads like you, you hear me? I'll make every effort so that the corps would get rid of you. You may leave. Oh my God! Comrade Colonel! 120 melons are destroyed. Indicator lights okay. Bumper okay. Comrade General! We have 170 melons destroyed. Rear left mudguard is gone. Rear door finished. Thank you, thank you. Comrade Chief Field Marshal! What will befall the melons? Get me a sample of that dark green one. Attention, rascals! Everyone set sail, OP's and cadets too. The IBUSZ cup is starting the day after tomorrow. Today we'll still strain at it. If all goes right, you may go to Lunapark with Mr Kapa later today. Topolino! Go get this filled by Mr Kapa. Come on, Taliga! Go Topolino, and turn back at the buoy! No cheating, Attila! Where are you going even? Go around the buoy! Topolino, no pumping! This is it, move on! Mogyor? has an inner position. And now heads up! The whole team will get banned on the race if you crash this much. Taliga, don't fool around, change seats! We're gybing! Gybing! Put it down, and then turn! Everybody, come to the buoy, we're gybing there! The whole team to the shore, now! The whole team out! All of you rascals, go to the shore! Dock your boats! When you're turning down the wind, in other words gybing, you've got to lie down straight away to avoid the sail, which would otherwise punch you right in the face. Let's try it, gybe! That's perfect! Now all you rascals stand up! Whenever I say "gybe", everyone lies down. Gybe! Now stand up! Gybe! That's it. One more time, stand up! Gybe! Stand up! Cs?pi, we have a problem. That bloke who bounced from among the watermelons, left there a plastic bag full of $100 bills. How's that bad? The state budget is poor anyway. Gybe! It's bad because all those bills are counterfeits. Well, that really is a problem. Stand up! Just finished talking to our expert. They somehow managed to wash off the print of $1 bills, and used the blank paper for printing the image of $100 instead. The paper is essentially legit, but now it's worth $99 more. Nicely done! Stand up! I have to find those people! Those two you chased, but most importantly the third one chased by them. - The plastic bag was his. - Go for it, Doc, good luck! Gybe! Stand up now! These kids saw that man this morning at V?g Moln?r's. What did he have? Big head and beard? - Pointy nose. - Moustache. Kids, one at a time! This is not the way! His nose was pointy? Pointy nose. Topolino's guardian was here, he'll be back in 30 minutes. - He's the manager of O?zis Casino. - I know. - You know him? - Not him, just his case. He drove the car into the tree Topolino's parents didn't come off from, right? - What was his name again? - Ferenc Tacs?nyi. Look at this buffoon! This is driving me nuts. Doc, we're having a race in 2 days. You know exactly what it means if we can depart straight away. And it's only these kids who can help. Seriously? They've gotten to the Grimms' fairy tales already. So you're not leaving? As long as there's no photofit all kids agree upon, I'm staying. You know very well that my profession requires a great deal of patience. Along with a tiny little bit of brain. Damn you! Gybe! Stand up now! Gybe! Why aren't you back there with the others? 'Cause they're speaking nonsense. You seen the bloke they're looking for? You bet I did. Hopped in to a car and bounced right away. - Was he alone? - No, there was someone else too in the car. - What make of car? - Lada 1200. When he jumped in, he dropped a bill. - What bill? - This one here. - What colour was the car? - White. Any chance you know its license plate number? - Yes I do. - Well? Letter Letter Number Number Dash Number Number. You realise every car's license plate number is Letter Letter Number Number Dash Number Number, right? That's quite dumb actually. Which grade are you in? I'm starting first grade in September unless I find a way out. You startled me, Mr Cs?pi. What brings you here if I may ask? - What are you doing here, Mr Purci? - Taking photographs. - That's my new hobby. - What are you taking pictures of? Whatever shows up. Love life of toads for example. And cars passing by, right? - Cars? - Yes, cars. - Why would I do that? - Because that earns you a small fortune. This time you're wrong, dear Mr ?tv?s. Should I tell you the name of that cleaning lady from the HQ? The one you've been fooling around with for years now, also the one who looks up the car owners in our registry based on the license plates on your photos? Let's not involve her into this, please! Right. Let's just talk about the thug who visits the addresses provided by her and sells the fake speed camera photos for HUF 1000 each, claiming he works for the police and stole them from the lab. Harsh words, Mr ?tv?s. Harsh indeed. And I can snitch on you in this very minute. Unless... We're here. Vink?! My adjutant. He might've already finished upscaling the morning shots. This way. Follow me. Watch out, mind the steps! Okay, this is the place. Here you go. These are the shots I took in the morning. Seven white Ladas. I'm taking these with me. In 30 minutes I want their 4x upscaled copies at the club. Why do all of them say 128 km/h? Due to our technical shortcomings. Any chance you took a shot of a police car this morning? What are you taking me for? I'm not that dense. Raw material costs me money. I'm no thief as such. Vink?! Speaking of which. Would you have a shot of pomace p?linka with me? It's home made. I can give it a try. Here you go. Milk, chesee, sour cream, Right into the bloodstream When this wasted, you know, I'd rather stay unseen. Chicks' buttocks I do cherish If it's 'bout a few pints, I'm ready to perish Drink up! Don't drink it for God's sake! It's fixer liquid again. - Are you nuts, old man? - It's not dangerous, happened before. - Come, I'll take you to the hospital. - I'd rather you took me to a pub instead. I'll have a nice warm pint of Kanizsai beer. Topolino, what are you up to? Get in! What did you scatter on the road? - Caltrops. - Shame on you! Wasting your time on such nonsense. When I was your age, I already had my own income. I was selling newspapers. My throat got sore by the evening from all the shouting I had to do. But still, I had my own salary. And you, you're just fooling around here. - Stop here for a sec. - What for? I'll go pick up my salary. B?la, I'm finished. - Here you go. - Thanks! "Tyre Repair Service" - How's your throat? - It's sore. Aren't you related to a man called Purci? I have no relatives. Mr ?tv?s! - Don't stop! - Why? Because. Did something naughty again? - Good morning! - Good morning! - Ferenc Tacs?nyi. - ?tv?s. I'm the guardian of this girl. You know, I'm having a race this weekend. I'm too busy to spend time with the kid right now. Take good care of her, dear sir. - You're confusing me with someone. - Take it. You can spend it on fuel. Wink at me again and I'll punch you! This one was it! Wink at me again and I'll explode. It's not me who says that. It's Freud. Of course this might sound unfamiliar to you. This and Sigmund Freud himself as well. Okay, let's start from the beginning. In the post-World War Europe, mainly due to its psychoanalytical respect, a method has gradually become a de facto standard, sexuality and so on, that was even approved by Thomas Mann himself. - And there's more to that... - Listen to me. I'll show you 8 pictures. On one of them, you can see the same bloke you spotted earlier today at the inn. I know which photo is the right one. I'm buying orange juice and ice cream to whomever manages to pick it. Attention, let's go through the pictures. This is it! You sure? The whole team is my guest, see you at the car. Here you go, Doc, this is the man we're after. - Let's go! - Listen Cs?pi! I'd need the negative. You'll find it with a gent called Purci. Cs?pi! Wink at me again and you'll regret it! Stay inside, a cop is here. God damn you, Cs?pi. Boss, get an ice cream and an Olympos for everyone. - How're you doing, Gyula? - Good. We miss you Cs?pi, damn it. Likewise, you old hoodlum. Cs?pi! Where does this Purci live at? 11 Babbleflower St. Up on the Magic Mountain. What do you mean? Let me quote you, Thomas Mann approved of it. Among others. You mocking me? No, Doc. But I see through you, like Hans Castorp did through Madame Chauchat's body. What do you mean? Doc Kardos. You've never read The Magic Mountain. Not that one. But all the rest I did. It's on my list though. - Can I borrow your car? - Take it, Doc. But take care of it. It's unique. Buddenbrook. I thought it was a 126p. - Mr Purci? - Yes? I'm here for the negative. What's a negative? I'd need the negative of this photo. ?tv?s said you had it. Our company doesn't provide negatives. However, the upscalings requested by Mr ?tv?s are here, pick whatever you like. Then I'm taking this picture. - Only if you take the whole set. - I don't need the rest. No problem, then they're staying. But you'll pay for the whole set. This is what we agreed upon with Mr ?tv?s. How much? - Pardon? - How much? HUF 1000. - Can you get me a receipt? - A what? A receipt. No. But I can give you my word as a gentleman. Want some fixer liquid? No thanks. I never drink on duty. Too bad, it'd be my pleasure. Can't decide? I'll have two please. The ride is starting now. - Mister, put me on the counter. - Up you go. - Topolino? - Two for me, two for Taliga. Thanks! - Where's your bloke? - You can't come in. Shut up! - You still don't know? - I don't. Don't play games with us. - Where's he? - In the caravan. Come. The door. Hi, police? Listen to me. You can recognise the person you're looking for by the fact that he's unable to sit down. That's because I've placed a BB upon his arse. Cs?pi, watch out! I'm coming. - Is something weird about your car? - None. Everyone's blinking their lights at me and drawing circles with their hands. That means those bastards warn each other about our speed cameras. Attention, Magpie calling everyone. One of the individuals we look for has been shot with an airgun. - Where? - In the back. That's not what I mean. Where was he located when they shot him? No idea. Over and out. - I'm going in. - Hey, what about my wheels? Come with me. You'll get it at the police station. I know, thanks. Tell me Doc, you want to wait until we roll on the axle? Or do you want to do something about the flat tyre? - Do you have a jack? - I do. Have you found the lad with the white Lada? The one that gave our bloke a lift. I've filed a warrant while we were at the sailing club. You're aware that repairmen get sacked if they can't change all 4 tyres on Niki Lauda's car in 20 seconds? Your point being? That standing here holding my car in my hands for 30 mins seems a tad bit too long. He was shot with a BB gun. He might need to see a doctor. We need to reach out to all GP's in the vicinity, so that they could give us a heads-up if this person shows up. The individual we're searching after is described as someone who is unable to sit down. By the way, the chap who drove the white Lada was brought in, talk to him. - One more thing... Sit down already! - No thanks, I don't feel like it. - Your name? - Mine? - I'm doing the asking. - Teodor Kopcs?nyi. So you had an agreement that that man would bring a pile of $100 notes and you'd buy them. - So what if we did? - Don't ask. Who's that man? - Which one? It's me who's asking questions here. The man who'd brought the money that had been taken away from him even before you picked him up. - Don't know. - How come? - I know him from the beach. - Got a name? - My name? - I'm asking the questions. That man from the beach. - Did he say his name? - No, he didn't. - Did others call him something? - Others called him Sparrow. Sparrow? Is that a real name? Or a nickname? - "Micknay"? - Forget it, that was in English. - I took Latin classes in school. - I didn't ask that. - Who is this Sparrow character? - Don't know. Would you still not know if I dangled you out of the balcony? What are you doing here? As you can see, Doc Kardos is busy working. You're on sick leave, don't disturb him. I wouldn't like to see you here again. Told you the rest earlier today. Goodbye. - A bit sour. - Sour? This? - Kapa, I'm off for some angling. - Mr ?tv?s! I apologise if I offended you this morning. If you refuse to take money, I brought you some taste sample of my wine. Thank you, now I don't feel like it. - You're mad at me? - No way! Cs?pi, some bloke was looking for you, he said it was very important. He was asking you to meet him at 8 at Bandi Oml?s's presshouse. That's closed for reconstruction. I don't know, I'm just telling you what he said. He was upset. He said you didn't know him but he knows you. He's called Sparrow or something. - What? - Sparrow. - 8 o'clock? - Yes. Alright. Cs?pi! Well then, cheers! Topolino, come here for a sec. Why don't you say hi? Now really, say something to the manager. The weather's gloomy, the manager's moody, his sorry ass is free to sue me. I can't handle this kid. I'm putting her in a boarding school. Once the race is over, have her taken to Budapest. So long! Help! Pull me out! - What's up missy? - I can't get out. Then why go in? - Wanted to give it a go. - Grab this. Hold it strong! That's it! Give your hand! Turn that way! Do you have any drinks? Wine, beer, p?linka? I'm Ilona Barka. I've got to be ashore by 8. Where should I take you? It's 10 o'clock. I'm two hours late. I can wait for you. You can make the call now. Hi, police? Want a drink? - In case you have tea. - Moron. What's up? Major trouble. This chap called Sparrow's been murdered. Give me some prosecco. The boss wants to know if you have an alibi. If I have? He's asking what you'd been doing around 8pm. That's when the murder happened. Give me a bit more. You were seen leaving the presshouse at 10pm. You're expected to be interrogated at 2pm tomorrow. The victim was found gripping a torn piece of a blue silk scarf. You do have a blue silk scarf. Dark blue. Listen to me, Doc. Tomorrow morning's ours. All threads are connected to the dollar forgery. A traitor's been snuffed. - I've got an idea. - Yeah? You need to find out which currency exchange bureau near Balatonf?red doesn't pay out $1 notes. I don't get it. Whichever bureau doesn't pay out $1 bills quite obviously places them elsewhere. Because those bills do exist. - And if we find such a bureau? - Then you'll scrutinise it thoroughly. I have my ways. Doc Kardos. Are you also curious about my alibi? Not me, only my boss. You bozo. I'm walking down the road, no one's inviting me in, except for my li'l wife: "Come on in, you moron!" Morning! What's up, Doc? All four heads of yours are killing you, right? We've found 3 exchange bureaus that haven't paid out $1 bills in the past 4 months. - 4 months? - Yes. One in the fashion boutique in Upper Tihany, one in Konzumex in Lower Tihany, and O?zis Casino in Balatonf?red. Splendid! Keep an eye on these shops. Once someone shows up to pick up the $1 notes, follow that person. If you're doing it right, you can track them down to their HQ. I haven't got enough people. We have sufficient equipment for one shop only. I won't have anything left for O?zis Casino but a cop on probation. So send the probationary one to O?zis then. Have your squad on the upper fashion boutique, and entrust the Konzumex shop on me. Boss, will you get me a couple of people? - See you in two hours. - Alright. Cs?pi! If all $1 bills that were exchanged in these shops in the past months are redrawn to $100, then it's an awful lot of money. Indeed Doc, a whole stash of fake dough is waiting for you somewhere. They likely wanted to smuggle it abroad. - How? - That's the question. - Anything else? - We have another issue. - What? - Urinary tract related. Not an actual hernia, but something like that. When standing it hurts here, and here when I'm seated. So not a hernia, but I'm afraid that in any minute... So boss, get us my men plus a urologist if it fits their schedule. - You have time, Buci? - Sorry, not now. Why's that? Are you a utility man now? For them? Any time. Watch this! Now! Gents, the refreshments are ready. Here you go. - Hi Fl?ri! - Hiya! Hi lads! - You know each other? - ?csi Pusk?s. - I heard you got banned at work. - Is that already news in Madrid too? Not there. I follow the rumours in Kispest though. Cheers! Does any of you know where Johann F?tty?s is staying? I do. Right next to my place in Bungalow #09. Thanks a lot! Take care, see you! Hi Johann! Do you still need that camcorder? - Of course. - Then grab a few hundred bucks and come along. That register is almost empty. Is the management aware? We have 400 pieces of $1 bills in total. No worries, that'll do. - Here you go, 400. - Thank you! Bye. Here you go Johann. So I'll see you by the Konzum shop at 12noon. I'll be there, see you! - So, boss? - There they are. - Coming along? - Not to these. If I did, that'd result in a 50-year sentence to them retrospectively. Cold-hearted fella. Mr Purci, Mr C?vek, Mr Ecet. K?p?l?, T?d?. Happy to see none of you is in the bin. - What about old Matuska? - He's excused. Died already. Can't be. The old chap is not that type. Whoever sees him, tell him everything is forgiven. I'd like to meet him. Listen gents. The Konzum shop in Tihany is ours. No matter what I say, you guys are babbling 24/7... Look at that, what a hot babe! So then I was like: "Don't walk on that plank, you hear me?" Now! Jesus Christ! What have you done? Calm down, sweetie. Our enterprise's glazier will be here in 5 minutes. He'll fix everything. The police are monitoring someone again. The police are monitoring someone again. The spring breeze is blowing, All the ropes are breaking, No issue if all ropes break, We still have a spare rope. Gybe! This is how it's done, you ruffians! And now, throw the rope! Onto my arm, come on! Your turn, Tibor! Andr?s! Next one! Yes! Throw it! Perfect! Now pick up all of them! Pull it out, twist it, take it. And now for the bowline knot. All of you rascals must remember this. A good rope with a good knot can save lives. Is that clear? Auf wiedersehen! - Hurry up, people! - Still waiting for the glass. 3 cans of beer would speed things up though. Okay, just make things quick. Why aren't you working? - It's fairly difficult with no glass. - We'll get it sorted! Apologies for the $1 notes. My boy's collected them. - No worries! - Thanks! - Kl?ri, get us two cups of coffee! - On it. Hello? O?zis Casino? - Mr Cs?pi! - What's up? - I have news! - What? - News! - Well? It's confidential. Keep it up, no fooling around! Keep right of way in mind and yield! What's up Mr Purci? A bloke from O?zis came in. He took all the $1 notes. - Where to? - I don't know. No worries however. Our lads are on his tail. - Mr Purci. - Yes? Find out where Sparrow stole that bike from. The one he left by the pub. - We'll meet at O?zis Casino at 4pm. - Yes sir. So who saw you? Her name's Ilona Barka. Address: 11 Alkotm?ny St, Balatonf?red. Phone: 53-551. I was with her until 10pm. The murder happened at 8pm. Hello? I'd like to speak with Ilona Barka. Pardon me? I understand. Thank you. This number belongs to Veszpr?m Zoo. They don't know Ilona Barka. At what time did Tibor ?tv?s leave the club? No idea. I was in the cinema with the kids. But he was supposed to meet some fella called Sparrow at 8pm in Bandi Oml?s's presshouse. He should be able to confim his alibi. - Is this the person you saw up there? - Yes. I saw Mr ?tv?s step out the presshouse window when the police cars stopped in front of the house. Thank you. Tibor ?tv?s. You are under arrest on suspicion of murder. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Cheers, mate! See you! Faites vos jeux, mesdames et messieurs! Twenty-five. Rien ne va plus. Rien ne va plus. Vingt trois. Whose bet was it? Black, schwarz, chornyy. Faites vos jeux, mesdames et messieurs! - I'm Goldie. - I'm ?tv?s. Cheers! Hello, police? This is Galagonya. A bloke called ?tv?s came in to O?zis, he's gonna start a fight. I need reinforcements. Understood. I'll keep him busy. Tokens for $50, and the change in $1 notes please. We have no $1 bills. Buy tokens for $100 instead. Let me settle my debt, mate. Please go ahead. Hallo, Casino Baden? Bitte Hungarian. Hun-ga-rian. Guess what mate. No matter how far one goes, he'll still find Hungarians. - Pista! - Sofort! - Pista, Telefon! - Ich komm schon! Casino Velden, Casino Kitzb?hel, Casino Seefeld, Casino Linz, Casino Wien and of course Casino Baden will all fly their own hot air balloons. Yes, in two days. They'll depart from here in Baden. Yes, there will be Hungarians too. Will O?zis Casino participate too? One moment please, I'll check. Yes, there is such an entry. Funny thing, we don't even know a casino with this name. Come again? Cut it out mate, I can't hear myself think! - What were you saying? - This O?zis Casino doesn't belong to our company. Regardless, they're welcome. I see. Thank you very much. Come in, Prince Charming. Faites vos jeux. Place your bets. Good afternoon. Were the gentlemen waiting for me? We were. And now we'll beat the shit out of you. I'd rather visit the bathroom then. I'll come help you wash your back. No more bets. Thank you on the staff's behalf. Don't disturb the game please. Pay attention to the bets please. No more bets. Calling Cuckoo. Cuckoo you there? Over. This is Cuckoo, over. ?tv?s is having a party in O?zis casino. You go there with a unit and arrest him. Apologies, but no cop from Balaton- f?red would agree to arrest him. Then take the Szombat- hely academy cadets. I don't have time for this. But we'll discuss it later. Understood. I'll alert them. - Topolino, the caltrops! - Take them. We can go now. Attention Hamster! Don't depart, I have an important message. Listen up! This might be off-topic, but it's still important. Call my wife and tell her to send Naprosyn. That's a medication. A pack or two. Also tell her it's possibly no hernia, but epididymitis. No need to freak out, this is only self-diagnosis. So call Budapest, you know, dial 01 or 06, and then 365514, okay? Yes. Epididymitis. And another thing. Okay, this is enough. Hands in the air! I had no time to play all this. $100. Counterfeit. After you, gents. Who are you, mate? Probationary cop. No fit. Amazed yet, sweetie? I keep sending you all these fine clients. Here you go, boss. Thank you. - Cigarette? - Nah. - What's up? - We're finished. Two stashfuls of dollars are in the basket already. The machine is spitting out the rest right now. - Only now? - We had a 2-hour blackout. - Damn it! Other than that? - All good. How about here? Not much. That ex-rozzer smashed the casino downstairs. - What happens to the money? - I'll stop by to pick it up. He's right here. Smoke him. Get to the rope. - Hey rascals! - Gybe! Get up! You got all sweaty, mate! There, there. You got your pretty scarf ripped. You better bounce, Cs?pi! The cops are coming. Beat it, you little thugs! You're having a race tomorrow. Cs?pi! The fella took the $1 bills from the Konzum shop to the mansion. To the mansion? Cheers, K?p?l?. - Mr Cs?pi! - Mr Purci! Have you robbed a scarecrow? Following the dress code. After all this is a casino, right? - The bike's been stolen from the mansion. - The mansion? Yes, the owner had leaned it against the mansion wall in the evening. And by the next morning the bike got boosted. - So from the mansion. Thanks! - Eine Momento. This will get handy when you want to sell your car. - Thanks, how much do I owe you? - Nothing, been all sorted long ago. Mr Cs?pi, you ditching me? Hey! Please! Mr Cs?pi, where are you spazieren to? Tell that police chief that his car is in the mansion. - Hello. - Hey kids. "Mrs Tacs?nyi" "principal" So this is how things are. You witch. Indeed my dear. Meaning you're married to casino manager Ferenc Tacs?nyi, the renowned hot air balloon racer. Indeed my dear. He's about to take off right now. He's participating in the Baden-Budapest Race. - What can I help you with, darling? - I'd like to look around in the mansion, sweetheart. Permission denied, dear. Too bad. "I'll be right back." "Danger" "High voltage" So this is how things are, buddy. I was about to leave, but I wanted to wait for the climax. Maybe it's better this way. One bad-tempered self-proclaimed cop less to sniff after me. God damn me if it's not your balloon you want to smuggle all this abroad with. You're such a smart boy! Two stashes full of dough are already in the balloon. I've got time to wait till these last few $100 notes get finished too. Then I'll have a little break. Fantastic. If that goddamn Sparrow... If that goddamn Sparrow hadn't stolen a pile of cash from here, the last couple hours wouldn't have been so exciting. But even this way everything's fine, right? Turn around. Start up, Kov?cs! Step on it! Put your hands in the air! No better time to run into you. You maggot! Let go of me! Push it, Kov?cs! Get Owl No. 1, Owl No. 2 and Owl No. 3 to sector 9. Cut it out, you hear me? Cut it out! Kov?cs, step on it! There's no use shooting at the balloon! You hear me? Stop it! It's useless! Cut it out! Someone should let Cs?pi know that we no longer want to arrest him.
