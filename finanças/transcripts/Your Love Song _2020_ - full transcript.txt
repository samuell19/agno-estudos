October, 2007. 4 people." I would like to introduce you to our new head of activities. I would like to introduce you to our new head of activities. This teacher is amazing. He is very talented. He came from Taipei. Please help me welcome Mr. Xing. Please help me welcome Mr. Xing. Hello everyone, My name is Xing Zhi Yuan. I'm very happy to be here at Zheng Yang High School. The fresh air here in HuaLien is really nice. The weather is lovely, and the environment is great... When I received the offer letter... There was this joke. One day, the teacher asked the students in his class, what do you like about me? All the students answered at the same time, we like you most when you are far away from us. Funny? Well, that joke is my life. I am far far away from the education system. This is my sixth year as a temporary teacher, and my theme this year is... Wandering to HuaLien. It was not a bold act, it's merely because all the teaching positions were filled in Taipei. They don't want me there. Dear students, I just want to know whether your opportunity can become my opportunity. "Your Love Song" There was this joke, There was once a couple on a train. There was once a couple on a train. The train passed through a long tunnel. And the boy blushed while he said: If I knew that the tunnel would be so long beforehand, I would have kissed you. The girl gasped and said: what, the one who gave me a kiss just now wasn't you? Well, that joke is my life. I'm stuck in this dark tunnel, not knowing who kissed who. Yu Jing, Yu Jing... Don't come any closer! Stop right there! "Hualien Zheng Yang High School" Due to the continuous decline of the birth rate in Taiwan, temporary teachers face another hardship. The education professors at the National Normal University advise temporary teachers to set a 5-7 years stop loss point before considering a switch in profession. Hey, what did you think of the new teacher? Hey, what did you think of the new teacher? A moron, full of crap. Only people from Taipei talk like that. Hi teacher, my talent is my perfect body, you wanna check it out? You wanna check it out? You wanna check it out? Man, you're on fire today. Awesome Yo, where're you going? What is wrong, man? I ain't got one hit today. Maybe next time, I'm going home for dinner. - Bye - Bye Who are you looking for? Hi! I saw an Internet ad that says this place is for rent? Yes. Feel free to walk around. My cousin's child gave up on the piano and they were about to throw it away. I picked it up and put it here. You don't mind right? It's okay, just leave it here. Love is endurance and kindness. Love is not jealousy. By the looks of your outfit, you're from Taipei aren't you? How much would you charge for rent? How about eight thousand a month? Eight thousand! That cheap? Expensive? How about six thousand then? It's okay, you're safe here... you're safe here... The floor must be mopped, clothes must be clean, even the cleaning supplies need to be clean. That's who I am. This is pre-marriage therapy, so I advise you two to open your hearts and speak what you think about each other. That's why I want to know all the details, all those dirty details. I said I'm sorry, what more do you want? How did you get to know that girl? When did you guys sleep together? Start from the very beginning... Come on, that's in the past now, stop making such a big fuss about it. No! It's not in the past yet! I won't go without you telling me everything. She's a client from work, we only met each other a few weeks ago. Was she the one who took the first step? Not exactly... that time... we took a liking to each other... when we met for the first time. How many times? - What? - You know what I am asking. How many times did you two sleep together? Is this important? It's important to me. Please tell me the truth. Maybe... around twenty times? What's the problem with you? Well what number would you like to hear then? The two of them only met a few weeks ago, but yet this number seems extremely high. What do you think, Mrs. Consultant? I was lonely. Is it my fault? Is it my fault you felt lonely? Can you not be so dirty? You're just like a dog! It's this attitude... I'm trying to forgive you; we are trying to find a way to forgive you. Perhaps we should put our focus back onto the basis of a marriage. The basis of a marriage is mutual trust... You don't have to forgive me. I don't need your forgiveness. I don't want to spend the rest of my life with someone like you. What the, electricity outage again? Who is it? The neighbour, from next door. Ummm... Do... do you... do you want a candle? Did you just move in here? Thank you, good night. What do you want now? Hello... "Private piano lesson" Am omelette please. Okay. Thanks Welcome to the first season of One Million Star... Welcome to the first season of One Million Star... As usual, here is the good news. We are at the countryside, and there aren't a lot of students here. We lack the resources as well. It really puts all the teachers in a tough spot. You're being too kind. Mr.Xing is young and very potential. Thank you. What year did you graduate from the normal training college, are you by chance the principal's junior? I graduated from the National Taiwan Normal University, and then I got my teacher certification... in Taipei, and I taught at various locations. To be honest, I studied education about forty years ago. I studied education about forty years ago. Times are different now. If you have any new ideas, feel free to mention them. Our school will definitely cooperate. Sure. Principle, I have a wild idea that I would like to ask for your opinions about it. Over the past few years, the internet has grown to become one of the greatest tools. I propose that we showcase talented people It may very well be a great chance for small town schools like us to get attention. Romeo, O, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Dear Julia. What's in a name? That which we call a rose. By any other name would smell as sweet. Stop, can we stop, please? Thank you for your performance... it was very... special. If I was to ask you who is the most popular person in school. Who would you say? You want to ask about Dong? Speaking of Li Dong-Shuo, I think he is more of a lonely prince type. And me? I am more of a wild and unruly kind, always giving others the feeling of... Mr. Xing, Dong is a third-year student in class one. His solo during his freshman year, wow... Hi It's you again! This bracelet... is my grandma's, I'm going to get it back one day... I'm just... having you keep it for a while. If you still want it then don't take it to a pawnshop. This place is not a locker you know. Grandma, it's time to eat! I heard you're really good at singing. Do you like it? - I don't want to be famous... - What do you want then? Do you know Jolin Tsai? She entered the singing competition hosted by MTV, She entered the singing competition hosted by MTV, and she took the champion. It's no doubt she had the talent and she worked hard for it, but what makes her special? She sees a chance to get on the stage and she grabs it. Fine, I'll talk to you tomorrow. What difference would it make? If I tell your Grandma that you stole something from her, you might change your mind, right? It's hard to succeed in a small town like this. If you don't want to do it right now, by the time you want to do it, you may not get the chance to do so. Deal... Come to the faculty room tomorrow. Let's see what kind of training is right for you. Bye bye. Ah? Did you make up your mind? Yeah. But... I will accept under one condition. - One condition? - Yeah. A band... I feel like a band would be better. These guys? Yup, these guys are my friends, and they have guts. They know how to play musical instruments. I... I know how to play Cello. I met you before. You were the one who can kill chicken. I know how to dance. Moving around doesn't count as dancing. I know how to hit. You know how to hit a baseball. Mr. Xing, I know how to play piano. Sir, they are the best performers in our school. Without them, I don't think I can perform well... Dear, we are "the only choice" for you! Three. Two. One. Hello everyone! We are the Mayday from Hua Lian. We are the Mayday from Hua Lian. Are you sure you want to copy the name of a band that already debuted? What should we call ourselves then? You guys... You guys are more like a bunch of ghosts in the ghost month. Just to make it clear with you, I don't want classical music. I want the modern kind. The kind of music that will go viral. Are you sure I can take these lessons for free? My Grandma told me that everyone from Taipei are liars. Man, you live in such a big apartment all by yourself? Do we practice here from now on? You cooked noodles? Why don't we eat a little before we start our lesson. Stop! You have one minute to explain what you guys are doing here before I call the police. I thought you talked to her about it? I thought you said you were gonna call her? You live right next to her! Can you show some initiative? I'm busy okay, unlike a certain someone. It's been one minute already. And put down my noodles. You have to trust that we are good people. We're here because we saw your poster, and we want to learn music. I'm the activities coordinator at Zheng Yang high school and he is my student. Hey you, sing something to show us your vocal talents. Wash the dishes after dining. Do you accept groups of students? "In my heart I feel how much seriousness there is in life," "I don't dare touch it." "I'm not a good person, but I'm also not a bad person," "I'm just someone who loves to dream." "I'm not willing to float with the tide," "like a drifting boat that cannot find a harbour." "I don't want to be a devious opportunist," "I'd rather be a fool." One for each. "It's not that my head is empty," "it's not that I'm useless," "People, oh! A lifetime is so long," "how can we happily pass the years." "I have my road," "I have my dreams." "Is it possible the world of my" "dreams is just an illusion?" "On the road that I've travelled, I only have hope." "Hope that all we've talked about is in our hearts," "believing one day it will all come true." "It's not that my head is empty," "it's not that I'm useless," "People, oh! A lifetime is so long," "how can we happily pass the years." "On the road that I've travelled, I only have hope." "Is it possible the world of my" "dreams is just an illusion?" "On the road that I've travelled, I only have hope." "Hope that all we've talked about is in our hearts," "Hope that all we've talked about is in our hearts," "believing one day it will all come true." It had been just two months, the weather was still warm in autumn. Due to the intensive training, those kids who were not highly regarded started to change... So did I. Who would have thought of this? The Elimination in Taipei, became a resurrection in Hualien. Became a resurrection in Hualien. Became a resurrection in Hualien. Where are you headed? I just wanted to go on a walk outside. You know, it may be safe here. But it's dangerous for you since you're from Taipei. But... am I a bit heavy? It's okay. My grandma's heavier than I am, yet I'm still able to carry her on my bike. Just think of it as your lucky day, let me take you somewhere. Let's go! Ms.Yu, why did you come to Hua Lien? I don't know. Why don't you have a boyfriend? Then why don't you have a girlfriend? I'll have one eventually. There is this girl that I like, and I just need to find time to tell her about it. Congratulations. How about you? Do you have someone you like? Do you plan on telling him? I don't know. Maybe you like a certain teacher with big dreams? Like who? You know who I am talking about. I don't know. How can you teach others if you say you don't know to anything? I don't know. Ms. Yu, You tell me your secrets, and I'll tell you mine. To be honest, it's no surprise he left me. Who? My boyfriend, you wanted to know about my boyfriend, right? Why? Maybe... it's because she's much prettier than I am. Her personality must be better too. On top of that, dating me is like the mandatory education you have to take Boring. What's so funny? No... it's just that I can't imagine a girl prettier than you. Hey, maybe it's because you're too young, and you haven't seen that many pretty girls. Listen to this. Hey! It's me. Come back to Taipei. Your mom told me to talk to you... How long do you plan on hiding away at the country side. Can we talk? Even though we can't be lovers anymore, we can still be friends... You tell this guy, you got new friends now. You don't need any new "friends". The rain stopped... Take a look at this. Happened to come across them behind the school. They were hurt then. I took care of them for a while, but let's see if we can make them fly today. Hey, thanks for being for my new friend. We Hualien people are really friendly, please do promote this when you are back to Taipei. The most important battle will start now. Everyone, the Black Spider team will have their leader King of black spider, Jam Haiso, for this run. Who do you want to challenge today? Hi, Miss Yu. Hi. Hi. How come I haven't seen you in a while? By the way, the Chopin CD that you asked for, that one with the little dog... Chopin's Waltz series. Yes. I managed to get one for you. Give me a second, let me find it... Thank you. It's weird, please give me a second, I definitely have it with me. Um... Even though I can't find the CD, but I have two tickets to the Ocean Park. Will you be willing to go with me? Ever since you moved here, I can't take my eyes off you. I... What a coincidence, you have tickets to Ocean Park? I want to go, I'll buy it from you. Thanks! Let's go. Thank you. What if we get caught staying here? What if we get caught staying here? This is how you're supposed to make the most of the Ocean Park. This is the first time I've done something bad like this. This is the first time I've had a girl tell me that I'm already doing something bad, even though I haven't done anything bad yet. Hey... why did you become a teacher? They asked me the same thing during the interview. Did you answer it well? I memorized the textbook answers, like I want to develop the most talented student, want to learn and grow with them... blah blah blah. And that got me here, lying with the fishes. I want to be a teacher to make the kids in the world to grow up freely. Unlike me, growing up under people's expectation, afraid to ask questions that I didn't know, and afraid to imagine things without confirmation. One day, I will be seen not just by these fishes. I will leave because I know this is not the end. You seem to always know what you want to do. You have a dream, and have a direction. I want to be you... You can't be me. Why? No particular reason. We're happy here. Let's not think about the things in the past. "I can't tell why I become very proactive" "If you love someone everything" "becomes worthwhile doing" "I want to announce I can't leave without you" "Even my neighbours can guess what I am thinking now" Hey! Wait... Dong sings faster and faster, and the drums get slower and slower. That's not okay! One more time. Ugh, my hands are so tired. We practice it again and again, I am dying. Let me show you how dying feels like... Sir, stop... She said no! Hurry it up! Lets run this once more. You have to have sportsmanship for everything you do. Why would you need sportsmanship to be a musician? In What universe are you musician? Go on! Hello, everyone, we are N-O-O-V-Y, Noovy The competition is reaching its climax. Have you voted your favourite team yet? Yes, I want to know how participate in the competition. Ok, wait a moment. Ok, please, ok, I see Thank you, bye. Yes! They said that we should upload a video introducing ourselves, and we have a month to prepare. Are we too rushing into this... Do we have enough time to prepare? Let's start practicing! Why is there one missing? No idea... Late again... Hurry it up prince charming How many times do you plan on being late? Can you be quiet down? My grandma is sleeping! Stop sleeping grandma! Your grandson's about to be famous! Wait, where's your guitar? Umm... I forgot. You know what, you can skip practice today, go back to sleep with your grandma. Who's that? Our new vocalist, and you are? Hi, my name is Wang Shi-zhe, I am the vocalist from the live band of Xiu-feng High School. I asked the program producers on the phone yesterday. Turns out, you don't all need to be from the same school to enter the competition as a group. Everyone, what do you think this means? A better choice means a better chance at succeeding. We don't have to ask too much from each other right now. Why don't we have both of them try, and then we decide. What do we need to decide? Some decide to be the audience forever, someone like him will never be able to go on stage. Sir, I can take the challenge anytime. Great! I'll do my best. At least give him a chance. If it's not for Ms. Yu, I wouldn't give you a second chance. If you can get the biggest applause on the stage of the Christmas Festival, I'll think about putting you back on the team. But if it doesn't go as planned, then that will be the last stage you perform on! Now you don't owe me anything, and I owe you nothing. Ms. Yu, do you think... I can succeed? What do you mean when you say succeed? Mr. Xing told me that if I perform well, than he'll give me a second chance. If I manage to grasp this chance, I guess that means I succeed. As what Mr. Xing said: we have to participate in the competition, and we have to win. We have to grab the attention of the audience on the internet. And you call this "succeed"? I don't want you to work hard for a goal that someone else set for you. You're great at singing, but you also can say no to it. I don't want you to pay too much of a price to understand this idea. People should reserve some time for themselves in their life. Hey, didn't we promise each other last time that you'll tell me your secret, and I'll tell you mine? You have a secret you can't tell? Hey, are... you... are you seeing someone? Are you seeing someone then? I'm not. I'm not seeing anyone right now. Then neither am I. "I can't tell why I become very proactive." "If you love someone, everything" "becomes worthwhile doing." Here, take this. You could be a good actor. Sir, if you need me to work with you again, I'm happy to oblige. "I want to take you to my grandma's house." "Look at the sunset together until we fall asleep." "I want to be like this," "holding your hand and never letting you go." "Could love be forever innocent and without grief?" "You resting on my shoulder," "and you falling asleep on my chest." "Just living like this with I loving you loving me." "Just living like this with I loving you loving me." "Just want to love easily..." "Just want to love easily..." Just want to love easily! When did they practice this song? "Mist is coming through the sky." "The river is as quiet as an oil painting." "Doves of peace strolling around lazily." "My heart secretly lights up." "Praying you are like a brave warrior," "watching and protecting our love." "The footprints you leave in my memory" "is the scenery I love the most." "I want to think about you day and night." "Send you a letter representing my love." "I want to think about you day and night." "Heart to heart, we will travel the whole world." "You are my festival, your are my sunny day," "my love will never sleep." "My thoughts will continue to fly around you," "and my love will my never set." I borrowed it from someone. Where's Mr. Xing? He said he's going back home to upload the video of your performance. He walked away with the camera in a hurry. Well... to express my gratitude, why don't we take a spin with my car? Where did you get a car? I borrowed it from someone too. Ms. Yu, thank you. For what? Thank you for being so nice to me, not a lot, not a lot of people are nice to me. The first time I saw you, standing at the door, I knew you were... very special. Hi, what would you like to order? Ummm... I would like a chicken burger, 4 pieces of Chicken Nuggets, a custard tart, and a French fries. Since way back then, I think... I think I have a crush on you. Would you like any drinks? What do you want to drink? I just wanted to say, we should find a time and talk about this. Sorry. Would you like any drinks? What? Oh, coke. Thanks. Umm, half ice please. You don't have to give me the answer. But I want you to know... Would you like to upgrade your fries? I want you to know that all those love songs that I sing. I only want to sing them to you. Sorry, would you like to upgrade your fries? No thank you. You know, confessing your feelings seemed easy on the television shows. But... But I don't want to get rejected. Sorry, can I get a cream corn soup as well? Let me repeat the order: a French fries, a Chicken burger, a Coke with less ice, 4 piece of Chicken Nuggets, a corn soup, a custard tart. Is there anything else? We're not right for each other... You know... you're too young... I can't... I can't... Would you like an extra custard tart with special price? That's OK, the custard tart is too sweet for me. Is there anything else I can get you? That's it, thank you. That's it, thank you. "Wedding Invitations, Johnny and Annie, Jan 3, 2008" Hey you, you moron, where have you been all these years? Yeah... You were gone to the countryside, and no one knows what you are up to. Nothing at all. Do you have a girlfriend now? No, I am too busy for that. Come on! You are a teacher that is a babe-magnet! It's true, I'm too busy... Please help me welcome our Best-man and the maid of honour. Our Best-man is the groom, Zhang Feng Qun's younger brother, and the maid of honour is Yu Jing, the bride's best friend back in school. She purposefully came back here from Hua Lian to attend this wedding ceremony... Now, ladies and gentleman, please help me welcome the groom and the bride! Everyone, let me introduce you to my best friend. He is a teacher. He's also a golden bachelor. Everyone looked up to him back then. There were about fifty thousand high school girls whose birthday wish was to marry this guy. So handsome... - Marry me... - Let's count, One, Two, Three... Congratulations. Together! There are two medical doctors and four engineers at our table. I think our classmates are living the life. Honestly, I feel a little sorry for Xing Zhi Yuan. Who would've thought that he would end up like this just because he followed his dreams. So I heard that it is in the countryside of Hualien. Last time, I got a bank investor. Really? I want to exchange mine with yours. Didn't you said you only want handsome guy? No way, what good can "handsome" do? I want to exchange mine with yours! - Hi. - Let's go. Dreams are just dreams, when it comes to reality... Xing Zhi Yuan's journey has been more than 10 years already... At a certain point and time, even the most idealistic ones tend to give up because they lack the money... Be careful. Take a break, phew, You, have him lie here for a while I'll go hail a taxi. Dude, you're super drunk. - You sure you can stop a taxi? - Sure. Is... he okay? He's a stubborn man... I've known him for twenty years, and he's always been like this... Hey... Be careful! Do you know that in the university entrance exam, he got the highest score in Taipei Top Senior High School? And then, this guy said he wanted to be a teacher, so the school immediately dropped 1 student entering National Taiwan University. After he graduated, he wasn't settled to be just a substitute teacher, so he worked on part-time job during weekend as well, and dreaming on having his own business about "Kid's potential development". Is that why he moved to Hua Lian? Do you think he has other choice? Xing, taxi is coming, let's go. - Be careful. - Hey, the taxi driver told me that his house is in the opposite direction. I'll get him back home. You guys can give me the address. Ok... Are you parents at home? Our little Zhi Yuan is very smart. He is destined for greatness. I must ask all of you to stop playing with him, you're just wasting his time... What? - Hi, Mister. - Hi, come on in. Be careful. You don't have to feel sorry for him. This is not the first time he felt defeat, he was defeated ten years ago. He talks about his dreams all day. That kind of garbage is worthless and foul. The bank calls me... about his debt everyday... A brand new special class to discover your talents. Think about it, please think about it! Thank you. "When he went blundering back to God" "His songs half written, his work half done," "Who knows what paths his bruised feet trod," "What hills of peace or pain he won?" Sorry. I didn't even study at that cram school... Back then... Everyone wanted to know me... They all wanted to say that they were in my circle of friends. "Congratulations to 1982 graduates" That day when my mom passed away, the teacher came to my house. She came to me and... said, Zhi Yuan, you have to study hard, and become a successful person. Don't let your mother down. I thought to myself, not even the death of my mother can stop them from pestering me to study hard. That... That's why I decided I wanted to become a teacher. My dream is to have all kinds of different kids know that there is more than one definition of success. There is more than one definition of success. And now... today... tonight... all, all those people! They think I'm nothing... but at least, at least I know how to do this... Hey, are you ok? Be careful... you are bleeding... Hey, you want to check it out, right? At least... I'm good at doing wedding dances... I don't need your help! Please don't help me... Please, don't sympathize with me, don't look down on me. Please... Please help me welcome, The main characters of tonight, the groom and the bride! They will perform for us a short dance. His song half written, His work half done. Who knows what path his bruised feet trod, What hills of peace or pain he won? So how have you been? Are you seeing anyone new? There are... too many people... I guess my luck's getting better. But they may not be the right one. Go on. I think, that going right into a relationship is not the most rational decision for me. After all that, I try to force myself to make a decision, but then... I feel uneasy about my decision again. Post-traumatic syndrome, it makes you want to forget, but then you always sink back into your memories. They want to take back what they lost... You have to keep in mind, you would be stuck if you have a leg on the brake and the other on the pedal. When being in a dilemma, people tend to be hesitant about whether they want to stay or leave and forget the cost of not making decisions. You know why prince charming and snow white lived happily ever after? Because neither of them... thought too much. Hi! This is Network Idol Show, our faculty has received the formal application for Zheng Yang high school. There is a great chance that you might be able to get into the top ten. Now we would like to invite the family members from each team to video a short clip of them cheering the teams on... Open the door, Dong. Good news! I just a received a call from the show that we have a chance of getting into the top ten. We can go on TV! What do you want? To say hi to your Grandma. I promised the show I would get a short clip of... She needs some rest. Now's not a good time? She's not feeling well. She went to the doctors today. Dong, open the door. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Dong! - What are you doing? - Dong! Don't sleep now. How dare you call yourself a teacher when you bust into someone's house like that... What are you guys doing here? She's your grandma, right? Why did you lie to us? I didn't lie to you guys... Your grandma passed away didn't she? You told us that she was still alive. Is that not a lie? She's my grandma... If I tell you guys she's still alive, then she is alive... Anyway, it's none of your business. At this rate, I would've been much faster if I just got a fake grandma to film. - Eh - What are you doing? Dong - All you want to do is use me... - Stop it! - Enough! - What are you two doing? Stop! Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? You have no right over me! Enough... Dong! Seriously? Are you saying he was attacked by the thief? At a countryside like this, we rarely have this kind of case. If you notice anyone suspicious, or if you remember anything, please give us a call. What should I do from now on? What should I do? Dong, wash your hands now, let's go eat... let's go eat now... Grandma, let's eat. The dishes are getting cold. Did you do good? I was the second place in the whole class. Really? Then let me go ask when the first place is going to transfer... Good Job. I'll sign here, don't forget to hand this back to the teacher tomorrow. Hey Grandma, do you think it hurt when my parents were in that car accident? Stop thinking so much, close your eyes... If you imagine that they're still here, then they will always be... There are a lot of tear wounds, you have to be careful so that it doesn't get inflamed. What's more concerning however, is the slight concussion he received... "Good health, get well soon" Hi, did doctor say anything about his condition today? Not wake up yet? Ouch! Sorry... The Central Weather Bureau has reported that there will be a massive rainstorm tonight. Yi Ian, Hua Lian, and Tai Tung will have a torrential rain coming their way. Experts advise citizens to not leave the house... Hey! Hey! I was about to buy some instant ramen and some snacks, but then I found out I didn't have any money on me. Great! Now I get to find out how much money you have in your account. Come on... A Power outage? It cannot be opened. What should we do? Will we be trapped here forever? At least it's pretty safe here. Banks protect their money with heavy security, so they may send people here right away. That day... it was raining just like this. He put a ring on my finger, and then we took a trip around Taiwan. We got so tanned, and my finger got a mark remained after that trip. Hey, why don't you talk a little bit about yourself. I don't have anything to say... Everyone has something they can talk about, you just don't want to tell me that's all. That day... I was in the hospital... it's dark just like this. Big rain. A girl sat by my bed and she trimmed my nails for me. See, like this, pretty... isn't it? I... The main characters in movies are always unconscious for years. That's why I trimmed your nails. Who knew you would wake up in a few days. I wasn't fully unconscious those few days... What do you mean? I was there every day. You weren't awake then. Wow, you are a terrible person... Miss Yu, My head still hurts... You know, if you endure it for a little longer, everything will be over. I don't have many strong points, and endurance is about the only one I have... You know what... when I was unconscious, I dreamt a lot about you... Thank you, you're a great person. Hi Mr. Xing! Congratulations to the July Boys for getting into the top ten. We would like to invite you and your band to come up North and join the competition for the top five! Hey, open the door. Right now? Or what, have me wait until you're twenty and you become a rightful citizen? Hurry up! Do you remember what happened when your Grandma got sick? What happened after that? She... She got sick last year for a while. It was pretty serious. But her condition got better. Everyone says that she's all good now, it doesn't hurt anymore. You know what? Sometimes the seeds grow, and you start to anticipate. But... sometimes the leaves keep on falling. What you have to do then is to check the soil and figure out what the problem is. Then you add the fertilizers. As long as the roots don't rot, there will always be another chance. I don't know what else to do. When the person you're talking to is not listening to your explanation, the best option is not to explain at all. Dong, you might not understand what I'm saying right now. However, I am a very forgiving person. Tomorrow morning, we start practices at eight o'clock. Same place, we'll wait for you. I don't think I should continue... Who in this world doesn't have a past they're ashamed of? What did they do? Pretend nothing ever happened? A eighteen-year-old boy may have no care about success, but at least he has care for love, right? Eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Miss Yu will be there as well. "We should learn from infants," "to be more forgiving." "Forget everything after you cry." "Stop dwelling on yesterday's pain," "Stop dwelling on yesterday's pain," "baby don't cry" "Happiness is an ocean and I am the wings of flight." "Happiness is an ocean and I am the wings of flight." "I want to find freedom!" "A group of shiny islands line up to make a smile." "They're called the happiness islands." "They're called the happiness islands." Well, what are you waiting for? Mr. Xing, what are you doing? Practicing courage. Hi everyone! We are the July Boys! Get up! Get up! Get up! "Love exists, in this new genesis." "I enjoy the feeling of confidence." "I can see, that you smile like an angel." How dare you... "I am willing, to stay by your side" "and grant all your wishes" Don't watch them. Don't worry about the other contestants... We came prepared. Fully prepared... Where are my drumsticks? Did you guys see it? I remember I brought it. Thank you very much! Now the next is The July Boys from Hua Lian! Please start now. "The clear river" "flows quietly in your eyes." "Your smile causes it to ripple" "on the calm lake." "The Green mountains" "rise between your eyes." "You silence brings the night wind" "as it blows past my ears." "You're a lily in the mountains" "blooming silently." "The swaying mountain wind softly caresses" "as the stars fill the sky." When I was a temporary teacher, I would often see the same kind of people in the education circle. Standing on the podium, talking nonstop. All I want to do is to help kids. To help them become who they want to be. "The title contenders, The July Boys" I am grateful for two things, one was leaving Taipei, and the other is coming back here again. Mr. Xing, This is a draft of your appointment letter. Inside it you will find a draft of your pay, and teaching propositions. Please do consider. I think you understand, for someone like you, Li Dong Shuo is just a beginning. We have the resources here, and we can do much more together. Thank you. Sorry, but, when's the latest I can give you an answer? Are... you not happy with the salary? Money is not my prime objective. Mr. Xing, what we can offer here at this school is to provide you with a stable environment to teach the brightest kids of the next generation. Is that not what you always wanted? Mr. Xing, I thought you were the type of person who would do anything for your ambitions. The so-called ideals, people think that they are all gains, but they are sacrifices. The one who understands these, can go further. Yes, I'm that kind of person. It's cool to take a official leave to join a show in Taipei. Look, It's Miss Yu! Where is she going? Maybe a DATE? Hey, I'm going out for a bit. Please follow that taxi. Your total is a hundred and seventy. "Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic" Could you confirm it and sign here, and here? After the artificial abortion procedure, please stay here in the clinic for about an hour. Did your family members come with you today? My... My... my house is just next door. "We are experts on painless abortion" Miss Yu! What are you doing here? I don't get to come to Taipei a lot, so I decided to take a tour. Are you here to sightsee as well? I... I came... to get a new pair of glasses. "Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic" Can you please... please not ask me what happened. No.36, Hot Ginger Tea? Let me get it for you. Thanks. Your eyes are really beautiful. So, it doesn't matter, if, you wear glasses or not... Hey, we finally get in to the final run of the contest. Have you ever thought what you want to do after all of this is over? You? You have a plan in mind? Back then, none of the schools wanted to hire me, and now, all of them are offering me jobs. Asking me to think... You had plans to leave here early on? So Soon? If you were me, you would need to think everything through every day. Did you ever think about the people close to you when you made those decisions? I focus forward, and I don't think about others. That's is how I got my achievements today. Because that is who I am. We are different... You're right, I can't be you. Do you watch basketball? You see that guy, he didn't make a move at the right moment, and he decided to pass the ball. Then he ran out of time, and the match ends badly. I'm not to trying go against you, but I made my decision to leave this place. But it doesn't mean I haven't considered staying here. I hope you can understand my decisions. If you want, I can help you contact that school. Why the heck aren't you in bed? We have the finals tomorrow. Do you want to go to the hot spring? What? Mr. Xing you're... a good person. You can't tell me this without getting naked? Miss Yu, she's also a good person. She, she probably a hundred times better than I will ever be. I always thought that people who came from Taipei were mean and terrible people. There are all kinds of people in Taipei. You can't really tell who's good and who's bad. Take Miss Yu for example, she's the kind of person who would wait for the light to get green before crossing the street. Me, I'm the type of person who rushes through even though the light is turning yellow. Okay, we should get going. We have to wake up early tomorrow. - Let's go. - Mr. Xing... If I see the yellow light, I'm the type of person who rushes in to. "Monday" Now the next is The July Boys Now the next is The July Boys Hey, if we lose today, count it on me. But, I thank you guys for your help, I appreciate it. 1, 2, 3... Let's go! You left this in my house yesterday. What are you looking at me for? You're supposed to look at the stage. Sorry, but we are not going to sing the song we had planned. We wrote an original that we would like to perform at the finals. I would like to give this song to someone I really care about. I want to tell her, that you're a really good person. Everyone around you, wants to be better because of you. "How to forget" "an unforgettable end?" "How to forgive" "a rational absurdity?" "When you walks into my dark side," "it feels like you have opened a skylight," your smile bright as moonlight "and it rips off my disguise." "Because of you, I have become a better man." "Because of you, I want to fly hight, to laugh loud." "Because it is you that I want to hug." "Because of you, I am no longer a loner." "All better now" "my heart knows that now." "How to put on a disguise" "when tears swallow my hardiness?" "How to hide" "the untold past?" "When your so called beautiful world" "starts falling apart" "Your wound can be healed" "because I will sing for you." "Because of you, I have become a better man." "Because of you, I cry, I laugh." "Because it is you, I want to run away with you." "Because of you," "I want to be your man." "All better now" "your tears know now." "Because of you, I have become a better man." "Because of you, I cry, I laugh." "Because it is you, I want to run away with you." "Because of you," "I want to be your man." "All better now" "All better now, your tears know now." "How nice you are, my heartbeat know now." Miss, we're heading to our seats. They're about to reveal the rankings. But, Miss, didn't you say... I know what I said. And the winner of this years Network Idol is Noovy Hi, long time no see, ummm, I will be in Hua Dong, this, weekend. Do... you still stay there? It's beautiful there. If you have time, you two should stay a little longer. Eh Can I sit here? No! Did you not take your meds today or something? Did you not take your meds today or something? Your smiling like a maniac. You know I've heard people say that when someone is at the bottom of the pit, they start giggling like that. Who does Noovy think they are? Is Noovy really better than us? - Right? - Hey... What? Idiot! Didn't you see Dong's face? He is so in loved that he even compose a love song for her. He is so in loved that he even compose a love song for her. Oh my god. I really want to... Then you must... The night when we got eliminated, we were still trying... Speaking of life, You think you are an independent existence, and yet, you are always connect to someone else without knowing it. Open the door for me. Right now? Or what, have me wait until your old enough for a wheel chair? Are you leaving? Uhm Is Miss Yu leaving with you? That's a matter between us. I want to compete with you, man to man. I don't think you know what it means to be a man. Just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you can teach me everything. Then... before you go, can you teach me how to upload videos? All those video equipment as well. How much are they? I'm willing to buy them from you. I may not have won today, but I can still sing. As long as I can keep on singing, I will always have another chance. Sit down. Let me tell you, a grown man will not allow their love rival to sit next to them. There are many kinds of possibilities, and the worst of all, is to miss someone you love. That night after Dong left, I have learned something. Hello mister CEO, I'm Xing Zhi Yuan. I've thought about it and I plan on returning to Taipei in about a week. It is my pleasure to teach at your school... I was wondering when you might see this letter. But, Xing Zhi Yuan, did you know? I've been following your shadow all these years, but you've just never known. Year 1995, Jimmy Lin came out with his first album. That year, you were already the idol for high school girls. Did you know I've known you for that long? You probably didn't know, I didn't just know you. Back then... I had a crush on you as well. One of the craziest thing I've done in my entire life is you. When my marriage ended that day, I decided that it was another chance for me to find you. By the way... I also know my way around the internet. Thank you. Back then, I just wanted to see you again. I knew, that I needed someone like you in my life. It's not just because you're tall and handsome. Mostly because it always seemed, that there is... there is hope in the future whenever I'm with you. You were born for great things, It was never your goal to drive nice cars or make lots of money. Back at the aquarium when you told me that you wanted to become a teacher to help set all the kids free and define their own success, I thought to myself, wouldn't it be nice to have all these small fishes return to the sea? Therefore, Xing Zhi Yuan. No matter what happens, please don't let this little girl down. "There is a kind of melody called "reluctant"" "There is a kind letting go that hurts like a knife." "Hiding, sealing, still can't make it go away." "Please make wound vanish in this song," "leave only the genuine beauty like poem." "There is a kind of melody called "missing"." "The more you miss, the more you hurt." "No matter how long it has been, the memories still carved deep." "I thank you with a smile," "and letting you go." "Leave only this heart breaking love song dedicate to you." "Dong: Hey, I wrote a new song." "Would you like me to sing it for you?" "Xing: Where are you? "Or I need to "google" you as well?" - Hello - Hello Hey, it's me... tomorrow is a new day, a new beginning. Do you want to go with me... Yu Jing's accident changed all of us. Are you guys Yu Jing's family members? Do you guys know that the patient has been pregnant for sixteen weeks? I'm the type of person who always leaves his favourite dishes to enjoy at the end. But in the end, the dishes turn cold, and all the people you used to eat with leave. I found out, loving cannot occur when there is a time difference in between. The only thing we can do then is to say goodbye properly. Take care. Go! What? You want more cash? Who would have thought that he went back to Taipei before I did. He went to the city, and he sang all the love songs he knew. He eventually made a name for himself as a singer. I turned all the regrets in my heart into fuel to help motivate me. I stayed. I started my own little schools in rural areas. I built my dream school. If one's not enough, than I will create multiple schools. And Yu Jing. She was lucky. Although she didn't keep the baby, but she started a new life at the Forest School. She comforted me. She said thank god her hands were okay and she could still play the piano. She always told me, her body may be a little broken, but her mind hasn't. If I have learned something from these years, it's the realization that the success I've been searching for, comes from... heart. It's not easy to leave a name for yourself in the course of history. But, when you close your eyes, the songs that move you and the people you care about will always be there for you... "Little school" "2019 Spring" Mommy, Is the wind strong enough here? Of course... Do you want to try the kite out? Hey mom, I have decided... What have you decided, dear? When I grow up... I want to become a singer! When I become a singer, I'll bring mommy on stage! Really? If mommy's going on stage, than I should wear a nice dress for that, right? You can play the piano for me! We can practice the same song! Right, we have to practice. That is my dream, my dreams! What I liked most in my life, were my dreams and ambitions.
