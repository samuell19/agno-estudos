Enjoy. Thanks. -Anything to drink? Bring us... -Soda water and grapefruit juice. One soda, one grapefruit, two cups. Wait, why are you deciding for me? Fine, order whatever you want. I'd like a soda. -Just soda? And some grapefruit juice. Two sodas, two grapefruit. No, just one of each. So, one soda, one grapefruit. And two cups. Why don't you trust me, Halperin? You wouldn't believe who I saw today. Why so much cumin? He knows it gives me heartbum. A film by Omri Yavin Halperin! "A Movie with Catherine Deneuve Now we'll show you how to make juice. You place the orange here, and you squeeze the hell out of it... Halperim! And you get a glass of juice. Just like with women. What do you mean? -You go to sleep with a young, pretty, perky girl, and wake up the next morning with a wrinkly, rotting 90-year-old. What?! -Who needs that? -Halperin! Just some silence. What is it, Yehezkel? I told you to say the ad isn't relevant, that I sold it. t’s not about the sofa. What is it then? -Your friend. What does he want this time? How should I know? Ask him! What do you want? To talk to you! -About what? Come down, Halperin, I have customers. Why don't you fix your phone? 'Cause I love you! It's been three weeks already! Did you hear me? -Yeah, I heard. I love you too. Well? -You ready? For what? A trip to the Baba Zee. -The Baba Zee? Let's go south. We'll leave on Wednesday so we won’t miss the French girl. Know what? We'll stop in Kiryat Gat, visit your aunt. She nags me to get married. "Get married already". Like I'm not good enough the way I am. It's ever since you visited her with Rafi Bukai. You got pissed off that she treated him like a king and you like a doormat. Why would it piss me off? Rafi really was a king. So let's go to Kiryat Gat, show me where he livec... No way, I could never go there without visiting Aunt Pnina. So let's drop by Aunt Pnina's. I'd rather be dropped off a cliff.

You just peed. -I'll pee as much as I want, what’s it to you? -I'm concerned about you. Better have it checked out. At your age it could be a prostate problem. At my age? Why, how old are you? go for check-ups. -Good for you. My urologist, she's amazing. Blonde? She just switched to brunette, but she has a friend. Pull over There is a gas station over there. I hate gas stations. Just pull over. Hello? The ad? No, it's not relevant anymore. "Natalie's Place"? No, it's the middle of the road, out in the fields. Hello? Yes, this is "Natalie's Place". Who'd you like to make an appointment with? With Natalie from "Natalie's Place"? It's just that Natalie isn't here, so... If you want to make an appointment... What is it? -They want Natalie. Who's Natalie? -Beats me. Hello? Finally. What's your name, son? You called me, who are you? I'm Igor. Nice to meet you, I'm Mano. Very well, Mano. Now, listen carefully. That's my phone you're talking through, and I want you to return it to me. Sorry, but we didn't take it from you. I know, but you've got it now, and I want you to return it to me. He wants us to return the phone to him. Let's just leave. If you return it, you won't be sorry. s that a threat? -A threat? Just the opposite, I'm offering you a reward. What reward? -A very nice one. Let's just drive off. But the guy lost his phone. Then leave it here! Where are you? Are you familiar with Yavneh? Yavneh? Yes. Drive to the industrial area, and keep driving all the way to... How can I help you? It's about the phone. Great. Where is it? You promised a reward! Where's the phone? Have a seat. There's your reward. We thought it'd be money. This is a $1,200 girl. You want money instead? No, we'll take it! It's our opportunity. -Just one of you. What? -Only one of you. But there’s two of us. One of you, as a reward for the phone. The other one pays. It's her livelihood, not her hobby. Excuse me, I'm not paying for this. Never did, never will. You so did. Flip a coin. Who's it gonna be? I found the phone. -You found it?! If it wasn't for me, your phone would still be by the road. I spoke with Mano. Which one of you is Mano? -I am! So you go. Why not? Go for it. You know what? You can have her! That'll show you what a great friend I am! Now it’s my gift to him. Go on. Get on with it already. t’s been a while since he... She's not a social worker. I have clients lined up till four in the morning. When does she sleep? Hello? Yes, this is "Natalie's Place". "Ha'poel Rishon Le'Zion”? Basketball or soccer? Yes, I know them. Impossible, I have just one girl here. I know she's good at it, but... you can't bring your entire team here. Forget it, look for a bordello in Rishon Le'Zion or something. said no! Israeli chutzpa. I see you treat her.. you treat her nicely, that is. "The end of time," 11 letters, First letter E, fourth letter H? That's a good way to learn Hebrew. "The end of time," 11 letters, First letter E, fourth letter F? -H. Come here. Don't waste your chance. He won't let you stand there all day. Look, you... You seem like an intelligent girl, you're great, you're pretty, sexy too. But I hardly know you, I can't do this. No need to apologize. -I'm not, I just don't want to offend you. I don't get offended so easily. -Is that so? Say... why don't we ask your manager for a cash reward? You know, for coming here special to return his phone, 200-300 shekels. -200-300? Why don't you switch off with your friend? Why would I? It's my gift. Then take it. Tell me.. Don’t you have a kitchenette here? Maybe a fridge or something? Why? Are you hungry? I thought maybe... Maybe I could make you a sandwich. With what? -I don't know. What do you like? Tuna. Me too! It's gotta be "Apocalypse", there's no other term. What about the D?! Maybe you made a mistake, try again. I bet it's a misprint. Tzipori. What's up? Kroshka’s coming with his goons. He just doesn't get it, huh? Relax, I'll be there in 5 minutes with Damul and his cousin. Great. -And remember what I told you. Never trust Russians, especially if they're family. I know, I know. What's going on?! Get in there. -Where? But they're... -Get in there! Before you paint the wall, you gotta fill the holes with... can't believe this. Halperin, have you no...? -No what? Values? -What values? Forget values. Don't you respect your friends? What's it got to do with it? Your friend gives you a gift worth $1,000... -$1,200. What? Oh, sorry. Hope I didn't offend you. She doesn't get offended so easily. Typical Halperin. He'll do anything to stay bitter, frustrated... Really? I thought I just wasn't his type. I don't know about him, but you sure are my type. Am I? -What are you doing? You can't appreciate a gift from a friend, so... -What?! I just need some time, you know that. I don't know a thing. You say I don't respect my friends? Alright, go ahead. What's going on?! If only you did what you came here to do instead of chatting with her... I like sitting and chatting for hours, what's it to you?! But why throw away $1,000? -$1,200! A shrink would cost you less. So now I should see a shrink? I have somebody, she's perfect for you. Come on! Those two will drive me nuts. Who? Who? Let's just say you guys are not the only ones fighting over me. -Who? Kroshka? -For example. Who's Kroshka? -Igor's brother. e had a fling once, he fell in love with me, and proposed with a plane dragging a banner saying "Nati, marry me!" Quite the romantic. But when he realized I wasn't into him, he got offended, and then the whole mess between him and Igor started. So they're also fighting over you? Yes, but they're crazier than you guys. We're crazy? We might be having a crisis, but we're not... -Midlife crisis.. With Halperin it's a midlife crisis mixed with the trauma of birth. And a touch of concentration camp. What about you? -Mano's is PTSD. A mixture of Yom Kippur, Lebanon and the Six Day War. He's been on every battle field! You also have any special touches? Maybe touching one particular girl... A girl who happens to be his in-law's partner's daughter. Your in-law's... partner's... daughter? See? It's complicated. So you guys are friends? Sure we are. Aren't we, Halperin? -Cut it out, Mano! I hate it when you do that! What’s the matter? -It hurts, okay?! Pull over Again you have to pee?! There’s a gas station nearby. We'll have some coffee. -No, no, no. Halperin doesn't pee at gas stations. I'll pee wherever I feel like it! You guys work together? We're on vacation. -Together? Yes. Aren't you married? Don't you have kids? Mano does. -What about Mano? What do I have? I'm divorced. Do you have kids? Three, in the US, with their mother. And you? Halperin? He's an orphan. What's so funny? You two. So tell me... How is it that... A nice, intelligent girl like yourself ends up... -What do you mean?! What's wrong with it? -It's idiotic. I just wanted to ask... You know how expensive college tuition is these days? You're a student?! Second-year, social work. Really?! -Shit! Sonofabitch! Who? -Kroshka. -Which one is it? It's not him, it's his bodyguards. Are they following us? Maybe they just stopped here to pee. Together?! What's wrong with that?- Kiss! Quick! Did you have to stick your tongue in?! It had to look convincing. You think I enjoyed it?! Where do you need to go? -I don't know. I guess going home wouldn't be wise. Come with us. -Where are you headed? We're going to... Remember Izzy Guttmann? zzy Guttmann? Used to be your neighbor. I haven't seen him in a while. He's been out of town for years. He only drops by to visit his parents. Oh, does he live abroad? No, at some kind of ranch in the Negev. They say he's got several women living there with him. -Izzy Guttmann? And you believe that crap? You'd believe it too if you saw him. I asked him to join us, but he didn't think he'd find time. I remember him. He wasn't very lucky with girls. He played the flute. He wouldn't leave the house before finishing at least six pieces. It was unbelievable. Halperin. Halperin. Hello... Halperin. What's up... bro? You've got something here. Well, what do you say? -About what? Look at him, he hasn't changed a bit. You haven't either. Still stuck to each other. A nature reserve. e've got a guest. -Does he want a menu? A menu? Enjoy. Bon appetite. Hello? Yes. Catherine... How have you been? Great, wonderful. When? Next week already? No problem. 'll send someone to pick you up at the airport. You'll come directly to my place. Yes. Excellent. .Till we meet again, Cathy Kisses. You speak French too? Remember Catherine Deneuve? The actress. She's visiting next week. -Get real. Who is she visiting? -Me, at the ranch. Mano said you've got several women living with you... -Did not! Really? Did he mention how many? I just told him what I heard. Women come to me for treatment. I don't live with them, I treat them. How do you treat them? It's complicated... I reinforce their.. I'm a therapist, a tantric sex therapist. I don't do it for my own pleasure, I've just been given a gift and I pass it on to others. So you... What are you actually? I'm a guide. What kind of guide? A guide of fucking. According to Tantra, the sexual act connects us to our inner divinity. That's why we must treat sex as a type of ritual. So you pray before...? No, we don't pray. Through Tantra we intensify our energy of life. We breathe life into our body. So women come to you and you...? I teach them how to express themselves through their body. How to reach... An orgasm. -Sure, why not? That's part of the idea. You'll be surprised how many women can't reach an orgasm. I get women from all around the world. Doesn't it depend on the man? It begins with the woman. First, the woman has to know her own body, to connect to her divine essence. Only then does the man come in. Catherine Deneuve. Okay, guys, gotta go. Sorry. How much do I owe you? -It's our treat. You sure? -Yes. Thanks a lot, guys, and if you're ever in the south, you're welcome to stop in. -Where? At the ranch. "Wind Trail" ranch. Any road signs to there? Ask for Baba Zee. What do you say? -About what? Should we drive there? -To Baba Zee? Let's check out the outside world. Trust me, nothing's happening. Let's paint the world red. Paint the world red? What are you, 16?! You know what? Let's make a movie. What movie? A Movie with Catherine Deneuve. Catherine Deneuve... •Like she's got nothing better to do than drive to some hole in the Negev. Your Baba Zee lives in a Hollywood movie. A movie without Catherine Deneuve! Some hole in the Negev. Nobody will find you there. You don't know Kroshka. He's a psycho. He once caught his girlfriend, a Romanian girl with fake boobs, just talking to some guy. He cut the guy's balls off and made her eat them. I don't believe it. I know someone who saw it with his own eyes. I'm convinced. Where should we let you off? We're not letting her off anywhere. She stays with us. What about Aunt Pnina? -What about her? e said we'd come for lunch. -So...? Well... -We'll say she's your fiance. You know how happy she'll be to hear you’re getting married. He loves his aunt, she's like a mother to him, even closer. When will it be your turn? It is my turn. We're engaged to be married. What would you guys like to drink? I've got soda, grapefruit juice, and water fresh from the National Water System! Got any malt beer? -Malt beer.. 'll take care of this. I'll come help you, Danny. Post-partum depression is very common among middle-aged men who lash out at their mother for bringing them into this world... -What? Even though she was here before and knew how idiotic it is. The only way to shake post-partum depression is to kill your own goddamn mother! But you love her! -She's your mother! God damn it! t’s an old movie. "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg". Bravo! Where did you find this girl? Cute, isn't she? He didn't find her, she's my girlfriend. He knows it hurts me, so he jokes about it. It's no joke. Look what a classy woman she is. Yes, she's amazing. Who is she? can't believe it! t's Catherine Deneuve! We're going to meet her! Right, as if Catherine Deneuve is waiting just for you. Did you know that Aunt Pnina studied fashion design in Paris? Really? -Yeah. Her diploma got her a job at a women's lingerie factory and she spent her life sewing bras for Kiryat Gat's beauty queens. Why don't you get married already? Look how you are killing Mom! You're such a sweetheart. Would you mind trying something on? Of yours? -I sewed it. t's a dress. Where's the girl? She'd better not take off. You think you'll get something from her? "Get something"? I'm worried about her. Yeah, right. You're worried about yourself. Most of all, I’m worried about you. -Me? Look what a wonderful gift I gave you. Look how pretty you are! It really is a beautiful dress. I have two children, two wonderful children, they've both been living abroad for many years now, while I remain stuck here with my late sister-in-law's schlimazel of a son. All I want is for him to get married and give me some peace! But I guess I'll only get any peace... When I'm dead. -When I'm dead Bon appetite. The problem is that no woman wants to marry him. He once brought home a policewoman. She had an ass from here to kingdom come! How does the police force allow this? She needed a custom-made uniform, so I said, okay, I'll help, I'll sew it. And she ended up dumping him! She didn't dump me, she wanted kids. You know.. He can't... Oh yeah? How do you know that? That's my phone, excuse me. Igor! Finally... What's the matter? Don't be ashamed. Maybe I should be! With my aunt shoving her big nose in everybody's business. Such a huge nose, even Uncle Shimon asked to be buried near his brother in Ramatayim, to be far away from her! Listen, Igor, I can't go on like this. I've thought it over. Yes, it's good money, but I feel I... Who? Ha Ping? ?What, he's in Israel Where? At the King David Hotel? There. Eat up, Mrs. Halperin. The chicken is delicious. Mom! Oh, dear! Mom! .Igor, I'll call you later. Bye Mom! Mom! We have to call an ambulance! Who's going with her? -We'll all go. Only one. But we're.. Never mind, Halperin, you go with her. We'll come by car later. -When? go with her. If I wanted her for myself, I'd never let you have her. Get it through your thick head that I'm always on your side. Always? So what happened with Shira Rabinovich? Shira Davidovich? -Rabinovich! That was 40 years ago! -I'll never forget how you sent me out at ten at night to get model airplane glue! Come, we can't take any chance^. What chance? She's in an ambulance. Maybe they're waiting at the hospital? Who? -We can't let them come near her! Why not? They're doctors! Come on! Who would believe it. Years of wasting his money on dates that go nowhere, and suddenly a gem like you, a gift from me. Never mine. There's always tomorrow. Tomorrow I need to be in Jerusalem. You mean, you're not coming with us? Stop it, you're as healthy as an ox! e have a guest coming. What guest? From the Foreign Ministry. From abroad? From China. -Someone Chinese?! A government official. Their Prime Minister? No, their Minister of Trade. He's a regular. I need to escort him for three days. Three days? If only you knew how well they pay... How'd you find him? Igor has connections with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The minister himself? Yes, they once worked together. He arranges girls for him...? -Girls? No, the Chinese gentleman wants only me. Why you in particular? Because I'm the best.. Scrabble player. What about our reward? Halperin didn't... And given the time pressure it's no wonder he... If only we could find an empty bed. Do you want to...? -What? Come on. -Where to? But it’s a hospital! Then finding a bed won't be a problem. But how will we...? I know where to find one. What's up? -Same thing. Maybe you should go talk to them, make sure they haven’t forgotten us. Why would they? -Go figure, this place is like a factory. But the nurse said... -Relax, we’ll look after her. t's been... -We don't have much time. You sure? Igor keeps his promises. But Halperin might be back... t'll take him hours to find a doctor. It's a hospital. But how...? -Is there a problem? No, but Aunt Pnina might be watching! Is that better? -What if she hears us? What's going on here? e were just... They were "playing doctor." Out! All of you What's going on, Mano? You were busy. I wanted her to have a good time before she goes with the Chinese. What Chinese? -I'm sorry, Halperin, but I can't watch you throw away my gift. So it's my fault?! This dating thing is going to kill me. You know what? Here's something for you. What is that? Take it, it'll be much cheaper than... How much cheaper? Forget it, it's a gift. Meet Suzy, made in China. Suzy isn't a Chinese name. What difference does that make? Think of all that you can do with her. What can I do with her? Anything you like! Does she have oars? Why do you need oars? So I can use her to row in the water. If that's what you want... What if I don't? You don't want Suzy? I gather you're her son. -Nephew. Look, Mr. Halperin, your aunt has had a stroke, she's in a coma. It's serious, but she is breathing on her own and her heart is fine so there's room for hope. Is there anything I can do? You can encourage her. Encourage her? You can talk to her, play music for her, stimulate her with familiar sounds. But don't go overboard, this is a hospital. Does she like classical music? Bach? Chopin? She likes radio programs for housewives. Maybe the movie with Catherine Deneuve? How could she watch a movie? She can hear it. -Hold on. Why a movie? Why not the real deal? What real deal? -Catherine Deneuve! She's here! -Where? t’s not here. Trust me. It's after the bridge, I'm telling you! "The Flying Balloon" Look; There's the bridge, and there's the turn. She's your aunt. You drive. You know what, let's ask forvdirections. Why not? Go ahead. That's a police car! So what? They'll help us. e stole this van, you moron! That's Betty, his policewoman! "The wheels on the bus go "round and round..." -Start the van! Drive! "till you drive it into the ground." -Go! "The driver of the bus goes "ouch, ouch, ouch, "All through the town." We'll get stuck. -Don't worry. t's a dead end. Do you want to get back on the road? Turn left here. "Left, left"... Told you we'd get stuck! -You jinxed us. If you hadn't said so, we'd be fine. Let's get to work! Hey! It won't work. We should call for help. Let's call your cop friends and tell them we stole a van from some clowns who came to cheer up children with cancer, and got it stuck in the desert. The Bedouin village is nearby, let's go there for help. Great idea, Halperin. You have a map, go find your Bedouins. Igor. How do you expect me to be in Jerusalem tomorrow? I just told you, I'm stuck, I need you to come pick me up. Somewhere in the south, past Be'er Sheva. Okay, I have the phone right here. Who's "we"? Who's coming with you? Kroshka?! Listen, Igor Igor, you're a real... -Sonofabitch! After a meal like this you wake up with a sugar hangover. When we were kids, they used to have salty crackers, pretzels... I don't get it. Why can't I get it up? can't get it up! Can I ask you something? We're on our way to meet our friend, he's a therapist... He says many women don't... Do you reach...? Do you come? What kind of question is that? Just asking. What should we talk about, trust funds? Talk about whatever you like. She has a lot of sex, it's her job. Yes, I come. Sometimes. Not at work, of course. Okay? Hear that? I think I'll go to sleep. Was it something I said? No, I just need some rest. Here, come here. I'll sleep in the van. -With my aunt? Do you want to sleep with her? -No, no. We'll sleep over here. Good night. -Good night. Good night, sweetie. Go get some sleep. What about you? I'll stay here and guard. Why? Want to pee? What if I do? Be my guest. Do you really think she'll be there? Catherine Deneuve? Catherine Deneuve. It's great that you're in the area, but it's a big area, you'll never find me here. And you can tell your partner he's welcome to cut his own balls off along with the tiny worm he has there! We'll be right back. -We'll be fine. Off you go. Where to, Mano? -Come, lead the way. According to the map, it's over there. There's Shtahash. Bedouin territory. You drank them all! Here you go. Well? Where are your Bedouins? t's been almost two hours. It should be here. -What should be here? Shtahash, the Bedouin village. Halperin? -What? Let's go back towards the road. We lost the planet earth, we are lost. Houston, Houston! We're drifting! Houstoooooon... Why do you need Houston? Just use your personal life cord. The umbilical cord will always return you to the mother ship. Pull! Pull! Houston? -Mom? A man gets lost in space and meets another lost man. "Hey, man he says. "Hey, man" says the other man and now they're not lost anymore. So where's the road? If you hadn't drunk all the juice packets... You always blame me for something. I finished all the juice, I took back your gift... How about some self-awareness? -What? Halperin, do you know what integrity means? Enough, leave me alone, go! We're almost there. Halperin, we can't stay here. I can. -What? Go look for the road, do whatever you want. And you? -I want to stay here, alone. Without you. But it's a desert, with snakes and scorpions, they'll attack you. I'll manage, don't worry. We're being bombed! -By who? Get down! -I want to stand up. Mano! Are you hurt? -Yes. Where? -Where you finished the juice. Come on. You know, Halperin, I don't think I could live without you. I could. Just kidding. Mano, I think it's dangerous here. Why? We're safe here. -No, come on. Mano, come on! Shtahash, huh? (Spelled like Firing Range) A Bedouin village? You can't even read! God damn it. Where are you headed? May there always be skies... "Eschatology". What? "The end of time" is "eschatology". How'd you find us? -Thanks to Google. Bravo. Where's Natalie? Oh, Natalie... -How should we know? They don't know. How about that, Kroshka? Kroshka? May there always be skies May the sun always shine... Well, Igor, should we cut off the balls of the guy with the hat and feed them to the little guy? was thinking the opposite, we cut the little one's balls off and feed them to the hat. But you know what? We’re liberal. Who is? We are, don't worry. You too. We'll let them decide. Guys, you decide. Who gets cut and who eats? It's your call. You have 30 seconds. If you can't decide, we'll do... What's the Hebrew word for "castling"? A castling move. We'll cut both your balls and have you eat each other's. What do you say? -Makes sense. May I be forever. Let's take them there. How bad can it be? They'll never harm her, they need her. It would be silly to risk our manhood over this. What about integrity? Integrity means being a whole person. With all his parts, including his balls. Okay, okay, we'll take you there. May there always be skies May there always be... It was right here. This is where we slept. "’his is where we had a bonfire. That's where we got stuck with the van! What's this? Natalie wore it to keep warm, it was in the van! -What van? "Nissan Largo", 2000, maybe 2001. They just left. How does he know that? -Google. Where are they? I can't hear the engine. They either drove off real fast, or they stopped somewhere close by. Where? There. Let's go, Google! What did they say? -"There". Where? -I don't know. Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Open the door! Hey! Hey, stop! Many girls who work in Tel Aviv came through the Sinai. e never did it the other way around, but it shouldn't be a problem. My father has many cousins, you can trust them completely. Abu Mussa, Abed Abu Seif, Ghassan Mashrawi... See? He knows everybody. e get it. But what will happen to the girl? Don't worry. Fahd the Emir is well respected. She will live like a queen. e won't throw her out in the street. It's not so bad, Halperin. Just you and me. What about Aunt Pnina and Natalie? Forget it, Halperin. Where there are women, there's trouble. What about Catherine Deneuve? Catherine Deneuve? Another blonde. Nothing but sex on her mind. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Madame Catherine Deneuve! Miss Deneuve, in one sentence, how would you sum up your lustrous film career? Sex. -Just sex? Don't you suffer from osteoporosis? Incontinence? -You got to work with the best directors,with Bunuel. Sex. With Truffaut! -Sex. With Jacques Demy! -Sex, sex, sex! Sex, sex, sex... Sex. Marriage is forever. She won't go for it. I hope you're not planning on asking her. Maybe she’s not even their girl. Don't worry, she's theirs! If she's your girl, she'll do as you tell her. I won't tell her anything. What? I'm not going to force her! Hold on. Nobody's forcing anyone. We're cutting a deal here. The Saudi guy is offering $600,000 for this girl. And we've offered him many girls, models. We e-mailed him their photos, but they didn't excite him. When he saw your girl, he lit up. Love, go figure. But if you aren't interested... -Wait. Come here! The best thing is for me to marry Suhila and you to njarry Samiha. Why do you always decide for both of us? Are you the father? I will marry Suhila! Fine, you marry Suhila. Better yet, marry them both! Both? $600,000. Right here, right now. Minus expenses and mediation. What mediation? Offer them another $20,000 for the old lady. My father is offering another $20,000 for the old lady. Old lady? -What are they talking about? Love, go figure. But she's not... -Even better.
