[MUSIC PLAYING] This way, gentlemen. Sorry to keep both of you waiting. You guys are from Vextro Labs, right? -Yeah. -Mm-hm. Well, here we are. What a mess. Now, you're gonna be transporting Clamol, C83. It's a highly toxic chemical. Word of advice-- don't speed through the streets, avoid the main highways, and above all, please, please be discreet. That's standard procedure, man. Here are your papers. Now, as you can see, your instructions and the directions to the chemical waste facility are printed on the invoice. Any questions? Naw. You know, there's been a lot of talk about these chemicals-- mostly rumors, and so forth. You guys heard anything about them? Naw. No, not that I'd want to worry you two, because there's absolutely nothing to be concerned about. But, for the record, this lab you see here? It was owned by a brilliant scientist by the name of Dr. Carl Craig. At the time he was working on a very important research experiment. Dr. Carl Craig? Yes? Hello. Janice Young. Your new assistant. Oh, hello. I was expecting-- I mean, I wasn't expecting you until Wednesday. Oh, well, if you don't need me, then I-- No, no, nonsense. Welcome to my humble lab. It's not much, but it's mine. You know, you're just in time to help me with a critical experiment. How much do you know about my work? Well, I read your paper on genetic engineering back in '86. Wonderful work. Thank you. But tell me, did you ever manage to recode the DNA strand to produce an intellectually superior animal? No, actually I had it all backwards. I didn't realize it at the time, but two years after publishing that paper, I came across the answer. Really? Come. This is what I've been working on since. I call it Clamol C83. Careful. Don't get any of it on you. It's lethal. What you have there is Clamol in its raw form, from which I've produced a serum. A serum? When injected into any animal, it will increase their intelligence level. Now, see, before, I had it all wrong. Before, I was attempting to increase the intelligence of animals by reconstructing their DNA ladder. May I? Yeah. But what I realized was that the body is a miraculous machine. Clamol, when administered in small dosages over a period of time, reconfigures, or mutates the DNA. After a period of months, the body adapts to the new form and the longer requires the injections of Clamol. The result is a more efficient, highly intelligent animal. And because the DNA structure is changed, each offspring that animal produces will be genetically superior, all because the strand encoded the message to each new generation. I see. So it's like sculpting a piece of clay. When the artist is done, it holds the impression. Exactly. Take a look over here. Janice Young, I'd like you to meet Edgar. Egar, this is our new assistant, Janice. Edgar is a fourth generation lab rat. I originally started injecting his great great grandfather with Clamol. Since then, each generation proceeding the next has shown increased levels of intellect. Edgar here is on a steady diet of 22 units. He's been making remarkable progress. I anticipate that two or three generations down the line will not require injections of Clamol at all. Their bodies will naturally conform. That's amazing. But what tests are you conducting to measure his intelligence? Well, a variety of sorts, but I started out with your basic mouse maze, which proved too simple for Edgar. Over here. Here are the individual test results taken from over 30 experiments. I assume you'll want to know as much as possible about my work over the past five years. Here's the chemical make up of Clamol, broken down along with variations on the formula. Here's Dr. Housman's six year research on DNA reconstruction. I used much of it in my work. If you want the remaining five years of his study, it's downstairs on microfilm in the library. Here's some statistical data you need to know. You'll need this, too. It's a comprehensive outline of my complete findings. And you should be able to go over all of that tonight. That should bring you up to speed. Tomorrow we'll get started at 6:00 AM sharp. Any questions? No. No. All right, then. Oh, and, oh, Janice? Try and get a good night's sleep. You're going to need it. Now, if you'll all turn to page 23, you'll see a comprehensive chart detailing all test analysis conducted on the various primates. The chart indicates an increase in brain activity. In each case the animal's response was similar, and this further demonstrates Clamol's overall stability and predictability. It is our belief that with the approval of the FDA to begin human testing, Clamol C83 will not only show positive results, as you have clearly seen in the data, but will surpass all previous test results, without any harmful side effects. [WHISPERING] Dr. Young, Dr. Craig, one thing you neglected to address in your report is the ever-occurring cellular mutation factor. It is a reoccurring theme in just about every result. We see in comparative tests, each time the end result is unpredictable. How can you explain this? Well, as I stated earlier, when administered in the proper dosage there are virtually no side effects, and in fact, our studies show that the mutation factor only occurs within animals, and will not affect humans. This is due to the secretion of certain glands, which I've detailed on-- on page 40. Dr. Craig, we seem to be going around in circles. Given the information we have, I am afraid we cannot approve Clamol for human testing at this point in time. Perhaps after another year of testing, we would be willing to look at your results. It was after the FDA denied Dr. Craig's request that he made a dramatic decision. He and Dr. Young decided to continue research for another year, but unbeknownst to Dr. Young, Dr. Craig had already taken an important step in the direction of progress. In the weeks that followed, Dr. Young would see some strange events. Carl, when you have the time, can you calculate these equations for me, please? Sure. You're done? There were over 30 problems here. You did them without the help of a computer? Yeah, math was always my best subject. Right. Carl, are you all right? Of course, dear. Never felt better. Why do you ask? I don't know. You just seem kind of wired today, is all. Could you hand me my notebook, please? Carl, you might want to lay off the coffee. Now, Dr. Craig was very close to perfecting his formula. In the following months he worked day and night. He knew he had to prove to the scientific community that he was right all along. But something happened that changed all that. One night, Janice received an urgent phone call from Dr. Craig. He told her to come directly to the lab. Something terrible had happened. She had no idea what she would find. Carl? Carl, are you in here? Ah! [SCREECHING] [GUNSHOT] Are you all right, Janice? Is that you? Yes. What was that? It was Edgar. Edgar? What do you mean? Edgar? What's wrong? Stay back. Carl, what's wrong? I didn't want you to see me-- see me like this, but I don't have this time. You have to know. Know what? Janice, I had no choice. They wouldn't let me test the formula on people. What was I to do? I couldn't sacrifice anybody other than myself. Oh, god, Carl. No! I was wrong. They were right. The formula changed Edgar. It took some time, but it changed him. I thought the mutation factor wouldn't occur within humans, but I was wrong. For a whiel, I was doing so very well. The complex of tasks were child's play to me. I required very little sleep. I was stronger-- healthier. I was a new man. Reborn. But-- but then I started to change. What have I become? Some sort of-- of monster? [GASP] Oh, Carl. Carl, it's going to be all right. I know we can find a way to reverse the process. There's no turning back for me. I've tried everything to save myself. There is no anti-serum. The process cannot be reversed. There's only one thing left to do. No, Carl. No. But I need your help, Janice. No. No! Listen to me! No! It's not going to get any better for me. I won't live much longer, anyhow. Save me the suffering. Carl, no! Please. You can do it, doctor. Do it now. -I can't. -Do it! I can't! Do it! [GUNSHOT] Over to the-- over to the left, dear. [GUNSHOT] So, that was the end of the famous Dr. Carl Craig. After that incident, all research on Clamol was discontinued, remaining existing containers locked away here in storage. Poor Dr. Craig never had a chance to finish his research. It's too bad. Think what it could have done for humanity. So, anyway, what do you guys think? It's all a true story. Yeah, right, man. Anyway. Good luck, guys. What the hell was that? Slow down, man! Go pick 'em up. I'll get 'em. You see that game last night? Yeah, man, did you see when Stark dunked it on Grant and Jordan? Yeah, man. I mean, he's got a hell of a game, don't he? You know, it's possible [INAUDIBLE]. No, no, don't say that. But Stark is not an entire team. No, but he's an important part of the team, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, but he's not the team. You're right. You're right. He's an essential part of the team, along with everyone else. Hey, what's wrong with that guy? He's headed straight towards us. Turn it! Turn, turn, turn! Damn! I don't believe this! Damn! Just look at this. Oh, no. No! You know, if any of these are damaged, it's our ass. Yeah, yeah. Pick them up and put 'em back in the van. What the hell's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Can't you drive? Hey! Hey, you all right in there? You all right in there? [GROANING] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] ANSWERING MACHINE: Three new messages. Hello, Divine. This is Monica. We're still waiting for those six poems, doll. I don't mean to rush you because I know you can't rush creativity, but the deadline has long since passed, and we're ready to go to press. If you've got the pages, just go ahead and fax them to me, and I'll look them over. You can reach me at the office until about 5:30 today. Talk to you later. [BEEP] Uh, yeah, Divine, what's up? This is Rosco. I ran into Robert the other day. Uh, sorry to hear about y'all's demise, you know, being a-- being a couple, and all that. So, uh, anyway, like I said, you know, you should give me that call, all right? Give me the call. You know, we need to talk. [BEEP] Divine! Why haven't you called your mother this week? You know she just worries about you. You should be ashamed of yourself. By the way, thanks for those socks you sent me. We love you, pookins. Now, you just call us soon. This is Daddy. Peace out. [BEEPING] DIVINE (VOICEOVER): I see you there standing in the midnight, too. So lovely, and so very true. This is our time, and this is our place. One on one, and face to face. The mist will cover our eyes, hiding our sins, deep and from far within. For when we make love, no one shall see how truly wonderful it can be. Although we may have fallen from grace, you know, making love in this mystical place, but maybe someday we will be free to one day make love under an open tree. [KETTLE WHISTLING] Ew! Mother, I'm fine. WOMAN ON PHONE: Well, I just don't see how you stay cooped up in that house all week. Mother, I'm a writer. I've got a deadline to meet. You know how it is. But before you used to go out, at least. Now you're home every night. Before I was with Robert, and now I'm by myself. I'm just going to have to get used to it, that's all. Honey, if you need company, I can fly out there for a week or two. No, no, really, that's not necessary. Has he called you? No, he hasn't called me. Honey, I know that you're still in love with him, but in time you'll forget him. I've already forgotten him. He's out of my mind. Good. There was no reason for him to leave you like that. The girl he's with now is nothing but a cheap tramp. It's his loss. You were the best thing that came into his life. Mother, really, I'd rather not talk about it right now, OK? Yes, you're right. Listen, why don't you take a long vacation? Someplace nice, like the Bahamas? I know a lot of single women that go there. It's a great place to meet men. Would you like that? Hello? Hello? Are you there? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I was just killing this bug. Bug? I thought you called the exterminators last week. Well, I've been too busy to. You have to take care of that. You know how those creatures multiply. Before you know it, they'll be all over the place. Tell you what, I'll call them for you. No. I can do it, really. In fact, I'll call them as soon as I get off the phone with you. Good enough? Now, don't forget. I won't. I promise. OK. All right, I've really gotta get back to work now, so, uh, give Daddy my love, and I'll talk to you tomorrow, all right? All right, honey, Bye now. Bye bye. Gotta call the exterminators. [PHONE RINGING] Dead and Buried Exterminators. Can I help you? OK. And how did you hear about us? All right. Now, you say you have a bug problem? Now, Brian's winter storm wonder, though highly decorative, and-- and creative, his bug, Clarence, only measured 1 inch. It's good, but not quite there. And Steve, would you get your ass up off the table? All right. Now, while Tina's undersea adventure was a little more effective-- you know, like a-- a Jacques Cousteau of the bug world-- and her bug, Oswald, measured 1 inch and a quarter. Not bad, Tina. Not bad. But overall, now, um, Lance's setting, the summer fling, presented the best look and design out of the three. And his bug, Melvin, measured 1 inch and three quarters, which qualifies him for the Raid State competition for the world's largest bug. Let's give him a hand. Speech! Speech! Well, uh, thanks, guys. Uh, as you know, I've trekked the city's sewers to find a really big bug for my summer fling project. Uh-- Should have looked in his kitchen. It's really helped me battle my fear of bugs. And if I saw a bug as big as my mother, I wouldn't be afraid one bit. I would. You ever see his mother? Thanks, guys. Yeah! Hopefully, with a little luck, guys, we'll win this year, and we'll bring home that trophy! Yeah! [BUZZING] You wanna get that for me, please, Dave? Sure. Sorry you didn't win. Hey. Hi. I have your batch of bug chemicals. Just sign right here. OK. How's it going? Good. Good. Good. You guys all right? What? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um-- All right. It's just been one of those days. We'll, we'll be seeing you. Goodbye. All right. Hey, Gunther, the batch of chemicals is here. What do you want me to do with them? Oh, good. Here. Put it over here. Steve, I want you and Dave to load this new mix into your guns, because you guys just about on empty now. The rest of you, I want you to use up your old stuff until it's all used up, all right? All right, now move this stuff out of the way. Move this. Put those right over here on the table. Take a look at this. Whoa, look at that. Hey, hey, be careful with that stuff. They say this stuff dissolves the bugs on contact. No mess to clean up afterwards. Hey, if this stuff works out, then we'll discontinue the old spray mix. Gunther, we've got another job in. She said she needs her place sprayed right away. Ah, Fairfield. Hey, this is a rich neighborhood. Yeah. All right, Steve, you and Dave here can take it. This will be your last round for the day, all right? Great. What? No problem. We'll get right on it. Wow, this is nice. Yeah. Just our luck, a big house. Man, we're going to be here all night. You watch, she's going to be old, ugly, and very, very crabby. I got a bad feeling about this. Come on, man, it's not gonna be that bad. Mark my words. Hey, Steve, look. There's a little kitty cat. Hey, kitty. Great. Old ladies love cats. Man, she's probably got more inside. I'm not even going to bother with this one. You knock on the door. I'll stand over here. [KNOCKING] Hi. Hi, I'm Stephen Reed with Dead and Buried Extermination Service. Hello. [CLEARING THROAT] Uh, this is my partner, Dave Williams. -Hi. -Hi. You must be Miss Divine Hill. Yes, I am. Come on in. I really want to thank you guys for fitting me in today. I know it was a last minute thing. Naw, think nothing of it. We know how much of a problem these bugs can be. Well, I've pretty much prepared everything for you. I've moved the furniture out of the way. Is there anything else you might need? No, that should do it. OK. How about some iced tea, or something? Naw, no thank you. Yes, thank you. I'll have some. Thanks. OK. I'll get it for you. Hey Steve, do you know who that is? No. Who? I knew her name was familiar. That's Miss Divine Hill, the famous poet. I've read all of her work. Really? I can't believe this. This is wonderful. You've never read any of her books? No. Oh, the way she puts her words, it's-- it's really moving. Well, let's not try and bother her with a lot of silly questions. Let's get right to work. -Oh, I gotta get her autograph. -OK. Wait till after we finish the house, then there'll be time to sit around and chat. OK. I will start on the rooms. OK. Do that. Where's your partner going? Oh, he's just going to start spraying. Um, is that OK? That's fine. Wait a minute. Excuse me, aren't you Miss Divine Hill, the famous poet? Yes, I am. I knew it. I knew that was you. You know, I'm a big fan of yours. I was just telling my partner, I think that's Miss Divine Hill. Wow. Well, you can sit down, if you like. Thank you. You know, I never dreamed I'd be here in your house one day. Life is funny that way. So, this is how a famous poet lives. Well, actually, I just moved in here, so-- You know, every night before I go to sleep, I read one of your poems. The way you put your words, it's moving. I've read all your work. Really? So which one's your favorite? Um, you know, I can't really single out one that stands above the rest. Mm. When I think about it, I love them all equally. Yeah. So, um, how do you do it? I mean, what's your secret? I don't know. It's just what I feel at the moment. I put it all down on paper. It comes from inside of me. If you know my poems, then you know me. That's so interesting. Your husband must be a pretty lucky man to have someone so passionate. I'm not married. No? Why? I guess I just haven't found that special someone yet. Now, I find it hard to believe that a woman so beautiful and talented as you obviously are hasn't settled down yet. Well, actually, there was this one guy, Robert, but, uh, he left me for another woman. Get out of here. How could he? I don't know. It just happened. That's terrible. You dating now? No, I'm not dating now. I've been too busy with my new book. I'm sorry, asking all these personal questions. Forgive me, but it's just such a treat meeting you, and all. It's all right. Don't worry about it. No, I should go and get down to business. OK, now, can you describe the insect or insects in question? Yes. It was big and hairy, and had lots of legs. Hm. Sounds like your paraplaneta americana species. Your what? Common house roach. It's a good thing you called us before the situation got worse. See, your paraplaneta americana species, though harmless, tend to reproduce at an incredible rate. Why, a single female paraplaneta can give birth to as many as 12 baby roaches. Really? Now, on the other hand, your blabberish gigantia species mates on a less frequent basis and don't produce as many offspring, but they're vicious creatures by nature. Of course, you wouldn't find that in most households. They're basically cave dwellers. See, the key with any roach is to reduce its numbers, you must cut off its food supply. Food supply? Yeah. You know those tiny little drops of crumbs that you leave after having supper? Mm-hm. See, they feed on that. It's a vital supply of food for them. Without it, they couldn't possibly survive. Well, I-- I do try to clean up after myself. And I use bug spray. Does that help? Well, a little. But see, it can't reach behind and in those cracks, where roaches do most of their breeding. See, that's where they sleep. That's where they roam. It truly is their domain. See, it's there where they create their own world, a totalitarian society with one purpose in mind-- survival. Survival at all costs. Now, they're fast and cunning creatures whose strength lies in their numbers. And each day they wage a war-- a war against their most dangerous and powerful adversary, humankind. A battle that rages on. Well, that's fascinating. That's-- that's almost poetic. Yes, it is, isn't it? Well, have you ever tried writing? No, but I bet I'd be good at it. But you know, there's always room for some improvement. Um, maybe you could help me, um, develop my talent? I don't think so. OK, um, why don't we go and see how Dave is progressing? That way you can, um, get a better idea of how we work. [COUGHING] As per standard procedure, our first order of business is to locate any nesting places. Mm-hm. Now, once this is done, we begin eradication by thoroughly spraying the infected areas, as you see Dave doing now. See, we're using Corrida D38, a powerful new bug spraying mix which literally dissolves the bugs on contact. Yeah, but, uh, is that stuff safe? Of course. It's perfectly safe. Around children, plants, pets, you name it. And the best part of it is that it's odorless, and it won't harm your walls or your furniture. Great. So how long before I see any results? Immediately. You should wake up tomorrow to a bug free house. Just leave everything to us. You know, I'm-- I'm really a little embarrassed. I didn't think the bug problem would get this bad. I really should have called you guys sooner. Don't be embarrassed. Look, everybody has bugs. You just don't see them. It's a common problem. Excuse me, but I need to get some air. Yeah, sure. Nice work, kid. Am I in your way here? Oh, no, no. So, how's it going? Fine. I'm almost done here. Um, I don't suppose you'll have anymore bug problems after this. Wonderful. Hey, you haven't had anythign to drink yet. You must be thirsty. Let me get you something. Sure. So, you like like you're a hard worker. Well, I like my job. Your partner Steve was just telling me a little about the different types of roaches. Well, Steve does know a lot about roaches, but you have a small cricket problem. Really? Sounds like you know a lot about bugs, too. Miss Hill, I just went to say that I'm a avid reader of your work. Would it be too much to ask if I could have your autograph? Well, no. I-- I'd be flattered. I find your poems to be a true expression of one's inner self. Take, for example, A Tranquil Light, The white leopard symbolizing the sexual duality that exists within us. When confronted he is forced to take on a mate, not by instinct, but by superficial desires. That's incredible. Not very many people understand the meaning behind the white leopard. Oh, it was clearly a commentary on modern day romances, stemming from sociological issues and racial upbringing. I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, here. I have never met anyone who knew so much about what I was trying to say as you do. I'm-- I'm flattered. Well, I'm a close follower of you work. I especially like what you said in A Tranquil Light, that we are motivated not by passion, but by love. I'm looking forward to reading more of your work. I'm telling you, I'm struggling with some right now. As a matter of fact, I'd like to show them to you sometime. I-- I could really use the feedback. Oh, I would be honored, Miss Hill. Divine. Please, call me Divine. OK, Divine. Wasn't she terrific? Yeah, she sure was. Not at all what I expected, though. Now, this is one run I'm glad we made. You know what? What's that? I think she likes me. -Really? -Yep. You know what I think? What's that? I think it's all your mind. You're just jealous. Put your stuff in the van, and let's go. Hey, wait a second. Didn't Gunther say this dissolves the bugs? Yeah. Why? It doesn't seem to be working too well. Some of them were still moving. I guess it just takes a while before the bugs dissolve. See, my guess is they have just enough time to crawl into the cracks of the wall. Yeah, see, it's better that way, because then their contaminated bodies can, um, take the poison into the lair and spread it to the others. I guess that's OK. All right, let's get out of here. TV: We now return to S. Torriano Berry's Deathly Realities on the Black Beyond Showcase. WOMAN ON TV: Chipper! Merle, I've got you. You cut it out. [SCREAMING] TV: Also in the news, tragedy struck this morning in a bizarre accident involving a Vextro Laboratories delivery van. The badly deformed and mutated bodies of the two drivers were discovered after a container of chemicals they were transporting apparently exploded. Not much has been revealed about the Clamol C38, the top secret chemical agent developed by Vextro Laboratories. Company officials say the leakage was contained within the transport vehicle, and there is no danger of further contamination. [RUSTLING] [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] [PHONE RINGING] Dead and Buried Exterminators. Can I help you? Yes. Yes. OK, let me take this down. And your name is, again? I understand. Don't worry. Look, we'll look into it. In fact, can you hold on? OK, thanks. Hold on. Hey, Gunther! Gunther? The problem with you is that you're too aggressive. It's just I know how to deal with women. Hey guys, guess what? That woman whose house you guys went to yesterday, Miss Divine Hill? She just called, and she said that the problem has gotten worse. Did you guys spray her place? Yes. Didn't you? Of course. Well, she says she's got these big bugs running around. Big bugs, the size of puppies. Look, I want you two guys to get out there right away. We'll see what's up. Hey, it's not my fault. Look, I don't care whose fault it is. Just get out there and take care of the situation. Got it? We got it. And make sure your containers are full before you leave. See, this is where I was. I was laying down right here, this morning, and when I woke up, this bug was directly on top of me, looking right down at me. And it was big. I mean, really big. Nice bedroom. I like it. Did you kill it? No, I didn't kill it. I mean, it ran off way too quickly, and I wasn't about to chase it down. I see. Now, it's a bit warm in here. Bugs tend to seek out a warmer climate. You may want to turn up your Central Air. Tell you what, I'll conduct a thorough search of the area and spray for the bug personally. How's that? Fine. Just as long as we get rid of him. Dave, why don't you down to the basement and spray again while Divine and I take care of things up here? Hey, wait a second. Why do I always end up off on my own? Yeah. Isn't it better if he stays and helps you? It's better if we split up. That way we get more worked done. Isn't that right, Dave? Yeah. Now, from the looks of things, you seem to keep a pretty clean room, so I don't suppose there's much in the way of food around here for them? But there's got to be some way they're getting in. Let's see. [BEEPING] No. Ah-ha. There it is. Take a look at this. That's a hole in my wall. Yes, but see, that's how they're able to get around, by crawling through these cracks, which undoubtedly connect from room to room. No. The bug was much bigger than that hole. No, it couldn't be. Yes, it was. Look, you were mostly upset at the time, and obviously misjudged the size. You made a mistake. Women often panic under pressure. It's nothing new. What? But I have something here that should help. Oh, and what's that? It's a special device used to lure the bug out and trap him. This way we can see exactly what type of insect we're dealing with, here. Now, if we keep our eyes on the trap for a while, we should see it come out and go for the bait. They're not too smart, so it shouldn't take too long. Um, so, what are you doing, um, this evening? I thought maybe since we both had this love for poetry, I might be able to take you out to dinner, and we can work on some new poems? You know, I know this nice little restaurant down-- You know, actually, I-- I usually work alone. You know, it's the only way I can become inspired. You know, total isolation. Hey, I understand. Oh, how about I order some takeout and bring it over after you're done? That way it will be just the two of us. No outside disturbances. No, you know, you really don't have to go through all that trouble. And besides, I'm on a diet. [BEEPING] Hey. Where'd it go? The bait's gone. You got some pretty fast guys here. We'd better stay alert next time. Steve. Steve. I think you'd better take a look at this. -What you got, there? -It's a big bug. And I mean really big. Let's look at it. Uh, excuse me, Divine. You'd better stand back. This is a man's job. It could get ugly. Shit, man, what the hell is that? -Wow. -Man, close that thing up. That is a big one. Where'd you find it? It was downstairs, by your heater. Well, is it dead? I think so. I hit it pretty hard. God, what kind of bug is that? I really don't know. I've never seen one like this before. You've never seen one like this before? No. Uh, excuse me, Divine. I think I need to speak to Dave for a moment, please? What the hell is going on, here? Man, I don't know. You tell me. I tell you one thing, if this woman has bugs this big running around this house, I'm getting the fuck out of here. Wait, wait, wait. We can't do that. Why not? That's not right. All right, let's take this one back down to the office and show Gunther. He'll know how to deal with it. Then we'll come back with reinforcements. Oh, that's a good idea. And let's just spray a little bit around here to make it look good, OK? -Yeah, all right. Excuse me, guys. Is there a problem here, or something? No, no. I just need to take a trip back down to the office to pick up some additional supplies. Standard material. Shouldn't take long at all. Is that OK? Fine. I'll be here. OK. Man, let's get the hell out of here. Gunther! Sam, where's Gunther? Where's Gunther? He's gone home for the day. Shit. Look, we've got a problem. I need to call him at home. What's his number? -Why? What's up? Hey Sam, take a look at this. Hey Lance, come here. What is it? Holy Toledo, that's a big baby! What the hell is that? Where did you find it? It's from my last run. That woman has got a really big bug problem. Yeah, you can say that again. What species is it? I don't know. I can't really tell. Seems to be of a totally new generation. It's a magnificent specimen. Are there anymore? I think so. They're all over her place. What a find. You know what this could mean, don't you? The discovery of a totally new generation of bug. I have to see more. A live one, at least. Lance, can I speak with you for a minute? Sure. Looks like you've got some trouble there, buddy. What's up? Can't you see? Dave just caught himself a big bug. Bigger than yours. Now he's the one qualified to go on to the Raid State competition. You're bumped out. Yeah, I guess you're right. I didn't think about that. Now, what you could do is go with them back out to that house, and if there are anymore bugs like he says, like that, you should have no trouble finding one on your own. Hey, if you cut me in for 50% of the prize money, I'll even help you out. Sounds good. Deal? Deal. 50-50. 50-50. Shit. He's not home yet. Hey Steve, we're going to have to go back to her place and finish spraying. We can't leave her alone like that. I'll go, too. You're obviously going to need some help. Uh, yeah. Me too. I'll go. All right. Well, get as much stuff as you can. Dave, let's get ready and go. All right, just give me a couple of minutes to get ready. OK. [SCREECHING] Whoa! Hey! Shit! What-- Hey, what's going on? What happened? -The damn thing was alive! It tried to kill me. Good. Uh, good thing it didn't hurt you. Oh, man, look at this mess. You better clean it up before Gunther gets back. Don't worry about cleaning it up. Look, guys, this is serious. You'd better break out the heavy gear. This is gros. [SCREECHING] Wait till they get a load of me. What are you doing? Nothing. Um, Gunther, I need to talk to you about that Divine Hill job? What about it? Well-- DIVINE: Just a minute. You're back. -Yeah. Sorry it took so long. We had to make sure we got everything. Divine, is one of our fellow pest-- pest control operators, Sam. Hello. Hi, Dave. Hi. Now, Lance is outside parking the van, and this is Gunther, our boss. Miss Hill. So nice to meet you. I must say, I don't get the opportunity to read much of your work, but I've heard a lot of good things. On behalf of the Dead and Buried Extermination Service, let me apologize for the way my boys handled the job earlier. I wanted to show you that things will be done right this time, because I am here to personally oversee things. Well, thank you. You guys sure have a lot of stuff here. Oh, yes. We're working with the most advanced equipment to date. Sam, you take the bathroom, Lance will take the basement. Steve, I want you and Dave to take the living room and closet spaces. And Miss Hill, you go about your daily routine. Just pretend that we're not even here. Is everything OK? I mean, it's nothing serious, is it? Of course not. We just want to make sure that we get each and every last bug. Don't worry, we're highly skilled professionals. Everything's all right. I wouldn't worry. I won't. Not with you here. Maybe we could get a chance to talk later? Oh, I'd like that. All right, everyone set? Set. Lock and load. Move out. What the hell are you doing? Man, what's wrong with you? Look, I'm sorry. This whole situation's got me pissed off. I mean, it's bad enough we had to bring Sam and Lance with us. Now Gunther's here, too. Well, you know why he's here, don't you? Sam told him we didn't spray this house the first time. He did what? Yeah, now he's down here to check up on us. And Sam will use every opportunity to kiss up to Gunther while he's here. That's right. Man, Gunther doesn't need to be here. His lazy ass is probably sitting downstairs, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper. Well, you know what? We'd better watch our ass while he's here. All right, well, I'm going to go back downstairs. All right. Would you stop looking at the paintings? All right. I think you'd better go around. Here you are. I thought you might be hungry. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Ah. You're welcome. You shouldn't have. Well, take as many as you like. No, no. Just one is enough. One is enough. OK. Thank you. [BEEPING] Hey, Lance, you done yet? Lance? Lance? Damn. [SCREAMING] What's going on? There's this big bug downstairs, and it got Lance! What? I went down there to check on him, and there's big just chewing away on his body. Oh my god. All right, calm down. Let's check it out. Wait a minute. How big did you say that bug was? About the size of a football! All right. We're going downstairs. -Hell no. Are you crazy? I'm not going back down there! Sam, get a grip. Now, we'll all go together. Well, what should I do? You just stay here. We'll take care of it. Everybody, get your spray guns ready. Let's go. Wait a minute. What? What's wrong? Dave, you take point. Take point? Why should I take point? Just do it, Dave! Move slowly, now. Lance? Lance, can you hear me? I don't like this. There's something over there! -There's a bug! -Back! Everybody back! That thing is big! I told you. Everybody, on the count of three, zap that sucker. Ready? 1, 2, 3! -What the hell is going on? -Don't worry. -What's going on down there? -Don't worry. We got it under control. Oh my god. You wouldn't have a-- a gun in the house, would you? Yeah, but why? Could you get it for me, please? Oh, god. Hey listen, over here. What are we gonna do, man? Lance is still down there. What are we gonna do about that? Man, forget about Lance. He's dead. Besides, something strange is going on here, and I think it may have something to do with this woman's house. Man, don't be crazy. Naw, naw, naw. He may have a point there. Them bugs might be coming from underneath the house. There might be some type of underground cave, or even this house might been built on some kind of toxic waste dump. I guess it could be possible. Wait, wait, wait. I have a theory. Our spray didn't work on that bug downstairs. Maybe it's the spray itself that's causing the bugs to transform and mutate into some hideous creatures? Naw. No way, that's too far out. No, you're right. That was a stupid idea. So what are we going to do now? I'm gonna call regional headquarters on this. Here's the gun. My ex-boyfriend gave it to me for protection. Smart guy. Look, I gotta make a phone call. Could I use your phone? Yeah, it's right over there. OK, thanks. Thank you. Your phone is dead. What? I can't get a dialtone. It was working earlier. I don't know. Let me see it. [KNOCKING] Now, who's that? I don't know. I'm not expecting anybody. I'll-- I'll get it. No, let me. I'll get it. OK. Who is it? I said, who is it? This is your fault. What do you mean, it's my fault? -It's your fault. -How is it my fault? This is just your fault, you know? There's no one there. Strange. [SCREAMING] Oh my god! [SCREAMING] Oh my god! Look, there's even more of them out here! Where the hell are they coming from? They've surrounded the house. Man, this is crazy! Damn! They've got us trapped in here! Man, this would have never happened in the projects. Oh, shit! Do you guys want to tell me how these bugs got here? Well, we've considered several possible, but to speak frankly, we're stumped. Look, have you ever seen those bugs here before? No. If I would have, I would have been out of here a long time ago. You know, these bugs started showing up right after you guys sprayed the first time. Why is that? I mean, don't you think there's some kind of connection there? I mean, your spray doesn't seem to be working at all. Is it? Well, you may have a point there. Look, we cannot worry about this right now. We have got to focus our attention on getting out of here in one piece. Well, what do you suggest? Look, first we gotta keep cool. Now, if one of us can just get out to that van, then they cna go and get help. How? With those things out there? Steve, I don't think that's a good idea. We'd be playing right into their hands. Well, how do you mean? They're smarter than we're led to believe. They know that the van is our only means of escape. That's why they've statio themselves around the house. Son of a bitch. Yeah, but you guys, if we stay in here, then that one downstairs is going to get out and get us. We're screwed either way. Not necessarily. We may be able to use this to our advantage. How? Well, we can see that our osprey had no effect on them whatever. Now, if we could get them to ingest some poisonous substance, something that'll kill them instantaneously, then we could probably just stroll right out to the van, without any problem. Great. But we don't have anything. Well, look, I could probably mix up something from what's in the kitchen. Hey, you know, I got some rat poison. Perfect. Uh, look, we're going to need something to flavor the ingredients to make it more appetizing for 'em. You got any rice, or-- or oatmeal? Oatmeal. I've got some oatmeal. Perfect. Perfect. Get as much of it as you can. -OK. -I'll help her. -OK. Look, you guys-- you guys, look around. See if you can find some-- some old clothes, and some-- some sheets. All right. Oh, we'll need some rope. -Is that it? -That should do it. All right. Let's go. We're on it. Great. God. I bet you guys don't have many days like this one. No, you're right there. Listen, I'm sorry about all of this. I want to assure you that the guys and myself are gonna do all we can to try and kill them. I know you will. I just wish we could've gotten a chance to get more acquainted. Well, perhaps when we get out of this mess. I know. Oh, that's an interesting piece there. Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's a piece of papyrus from the papyrus plant. And that particular piece is over 4,000 years old. You know, there's this great story about the Egyptian goddess Aset and the god Asar. They were husband and wife, brother and sister, mother and son. Well, you should know this stuff. It's part of our history. I should. You know, that's where I get most of my inspiration from. You see, the god Asar was killed by his evil brother Set. His body was then dismembered and thrown into the Nile river. Aset loved him so that she sought after him, recovering his body from the river. She then put him back together. Hence, because of this, she made justice stronger than silver or gold. It's kind of the way I feel when I love someone. I love them with all of my heart. A love more precious than material items. Wow. That must be wonderful, to love someone that much. Yeah, it is. Especially when they don't even know it. Hey, how's that poison coming? Uh, great. Great. It's coming along great. Yeah. Yummy. Look, we're pretty much done out there, so if you need any help, let me know. Sure. OK. You know, this stuff is turning out great, if I must say so myself. Yeah, I'm sure they'll love your cooking. Excuse me. So, um, how's your book coming along? You made any progress? Yeah, actually. It's coming along OK. I'm on the last chapter now. Hey, you know, your partner really amazes me. I mean, he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would be into my work. Who, Steve? Yeah. He says he's read a lot of my books. Psh. Steve has never read any of your books. He hates poetry. He didn't even know who you were until I told him. Really? Uh, well, maybe I shouldn't have said anything. No. No. You always seem to say the right thing. Hey, guys, what's going on? Uh, nothing. Nothing at all. You know, Divine, when this is all over, I'd love to sit down and go over some of your latest poetry. Excuse me. Man, this whole bug thing must be getting to her. You know, women are like that. Strange creatures. You never really understand them. She likes me, though. I can tell. If you say so. Hey, so what were you guys in here doing, anyway? I'll let you figure it out. Yeah, that's enough. That's enough. OK. Sam, take them off. They're not going to eat this crap. -They'll eat it. -Just do it. OK. Steve, fasten the rope around its neck. What we're going to do is we're going to throw it outside. Now, hopefully the bugs will go-- And when they don't? We'll just pull it back in. OK? -All right. -All right. -I've got it. -All right. Dave, help me with this. Sam, you get the gun. All right, now, when I open the door, you guys throw it out as far as you can. And make sure, Gunther, you close the door as soon as we're done. -OK. Divine, you take cover. DIVINE: OK. -All right, you ready? -Yes. OK. Here we go. -Man, it's not gonna work. -Here we go. Now. Now! All right, let's take a look. It's not gonna work. Would you stop it? It's not gonna work, I'm telling you. Would you shut up? Look, look. There it is. Wait a minute, I don't see anything. I think they're gone. -No, no. They're still out there. They're just hiding. Nothing's happening. Give it a few minutes. Wait, wait, I see something in the trees. I see it, too. -Wait a minute. -What? What are they doing? What? Something's going on. You gotta be freakin' kiddin' me. Well, it looks like we've underestimated our bug friends. They're obviously intelligent-- probably more so than we. So what do you think they're doing now? Well, my guess is that they're out there working on a plan on how to get in here now, as we speak. Well what are our options here? All right, look, the phone line is down, so we obviously can't call out for help. Now, we could wait until morning and try and make a break for the van. Naw, but we're not gonna last that long. I agree. Look, somehow we've gotta get out to that van tonight. Well, what do we have? All right, now, we have these three pipe bombs that Gunther and I made. Now, they may or may not work. They'll work. This gun-- if you ask me, this is the best possible defense we have against them. And if all else fails, this bat'll knock the hell out of a couple of 'em. But we're not even sure any of these weapons are going to work against them. You guys! [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] Ah! Oh, god. What was it doing under the table? Stealing our stuff, no doubt. Oh, god. Well, it's dead now. You guys gotta clean this mess up. You got a mop, or something? In the bathroom. I'll get it. The rest of you guys, pick up the rest of these bug pieces, and get rid of it! Well, you-- you go ahead. Don't look at me. I ain't doing it. I suppose you want me to clean it up? Damn. [SCREAMING] What's wrong, man? Whoa, whoa, whoa. They're inside! They're inside! Shit! Christ, man, you all right? Get the pipe bomb. Get the pipe bomb. All right. Yeah. Here. Here. Come on, man, hurry up! -I am! I am! -Come on. Fire in the hole! Go! Is it gonna light? Any second, now. Oh, shit! Here! Hey! No, you! Here! Take the damn thing! Hey! What? Aw, shit! -Did you hear that? -What was that? Just stay here. Gunther, they need your help! Go help them! It'll be all right. Don't worry. Gunther, go help them! Something's wrong! Gunther, what's wrong with you? Go and help them! They need you! Something is wrong! Gunther, go! What's wrong with you? Go and help them! [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] Oh my god! How does it feel? It looks infected. It's fine. Don't worry. Dave, do you think that we're going to get out of here alive? Of course we will. I'm scared, Dave. I'm really scared. Listen, you don't have to be frightened. I'm here, and I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. It's not only that. I'm afraid for the both of us. I'm afraid to lose you. If I can't be with you, I'd rather not be at all. Damn, did you all see Sam splattered up against the wall like that? Oh, it was gross. [GROWLING] They're trying to get out! I'm going to bolt that door. I'll be back. I see you two have been spending a lot of time together. You like him, don't you? Yeah, I can tell by the way you look at each other. I don't know. Do you think it'll work? I don't know. Right now none of us have very much time, so I think you and Dave should try and spend as much time as you can together. It's just not fair. No, it's not. But hey, look, life's not fair, right? I mean, Dave's a good kid, and-- well, now that I think about it, I guess you guys do make a pretty good couple. Everything's cool. I've secured the door. They won't be coming out. Well, it looks like it's just the three of us, guys. We'd better stay close. No telling what's going to-- shit. They cut the lights. The lights. They got the lights. All right, look, let's stay together. Don't separate. Divine, you must have some candles or a flashlight, right? I do. OK, get it. Good. Good. All right, now look, they must have gotten to the fuse box. We can't let it stay dark like this. It's too much to their advantage. We're gonna have to go downstairs and fix it. What? I don't believe this. We gotta go back in the basement? There's a bug down there, man. There's no other way. We gotta do it. Divine, you stay here. Here, take this. OK. You do know that that bug is going to be down there waiting for us? That's right. And this time, we'll be ready. Here we go again. Be careful. That bug's not down here. I don't see it anywhere. Yes it is, man. I know it is. It's just hiding. -OK, there's the box. -Look out. I got this. Hey, listen, you'd better let me do that, OK? Man, would you just cool and watch out for the bug? I'll have the lights on in a minute. Come on, man. You don't know what you're doing. Let me do it. What do you mean, I don't know what I'm doing? Hell, I change a fuse in my apartment every day, man. It's not a fuse box, it's a circuit breaker, stupid. Well, whatever the hell. A circuit breaker or a fuse, it don't matter. All I gotta do is hit one more of these little things, and-- What happened? Where-- where's Steve? He's dead. Come on. What? We're getting the hell out of here. [SCREAMING] Oh my god! What are you gonna do with that? I'm gonna blow the house up. What? Oh my god! No! [EXPLOSION] Well, we've got a lot of stuff here, and that should last us a while. Where-- where are we headed? I don't know. Some place far. You know we'd never be able to explain what happened back there. I know. Sorry about your house. It's OK. You know, one good thing did come out of this. Yeah? What's that? We found each other. I guess we did. You know, the only thing I regret is not winning that contest for the world's biggest bug. There'll be other contests. It won't matter. Even thought I didn't win, I know I walked away with the prize. [MUSIC PLAYING]
