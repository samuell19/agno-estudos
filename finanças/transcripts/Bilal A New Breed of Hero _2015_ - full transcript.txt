Tell your father I'll deliver his order today! - (WHIMPERS) - Ghufaira. Did they hurt you? Oh. I should have been here to protect you. I will never let anyone hurt you ever again. (WIND WHISTLES) Step forward. Be generous. Make your offer, and this prize specimen shall be yours. Do I hear a second on that? Third? Sold. Sold. Get this wretch out of here. Bring up the next one. (MAN GROANS) This is the finest slave... in my possession. He's clever. He reads and writes. He speaks 20 languages. 20, I say! Ooh-ooh-ooh! He even speaks to animals! Oh, great Umayya, you can't ask for a better servant on your trading missions. Oh, no. (GASPS) Uh, that one is not quite as clever... but he is as strong as an ox. - I'll take him. - You will? I mean... excellent choice! (CHUCKLES) He's a bit expensive, but I know the gods have been generous to you, my dearest Umayya. (CHUCKLES) Okba, one of these days, I'm going to dip your tongue in a bowl of dry sand. Have him delivered. Ah! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Ah, thank you! (CHUCKLES) Ah, blessed Umayya. Oh, gracious, magnificent... (CACKLES) Your Honour, I have the idols you ordered. Should I bring them to your home, or to the shop in the market? What do you think? - Uh... - The market, you idiot. And the next time you're late, I won't pay. A thousand pardons. It won't happen again. I was delayed; I had to come to the aid of your son, Safwan. - Hmm? What about Safwan? - He was being assaulted by a slave boy. - Which slave? - They called him Bilal. He had your son on the ground. But I, I pulled him off. Ha! Saved him from a thrashing. Enough. Take these idols to my stall at once, or forget the deal. Yes, sir. Of course. Right away. Bilal! Pick it up. I said... pick it up. (LOW MUSIC) (SNARLS) - (SHOUTS) - (OBJECTS CLATTER) - Aargh!

(GROANS) Father, I hope you are going to teach him a lesson he'll never- How could you let a slave beat you? Bilal's lying, Father! The slave, he's lying! He did not beat- - (GRUNTS) - You made me look like a fool. (WHIMPERS) Stop it. Stop it, I say! - Listen. - (SOLDIER GRUNTS) (WHIP CRACKS, SOLDIER GRUNTS) - (BILAL GRUNTS) - He isn't crying.

Your father was a great man. What do you want to be when you grow up, Bilal? - Hmm. - A farmer? Or maybe a merchant that makes a lot of money? Huh. I want to be a great warrior! (CHUCKLES) And that's what you will be... a great warrior... with a beautiful voice. And I want to ride on a big horse. - And I will fight enemies and protect you and Ghufaira. - That's very honourable, Bilal. But remember, a sword and a horse cannot make you a great man. - They can't? - No. Being a great man means living without chains. Huh. Chains? No, no. The ones you can't see. The ones... in here. - Inside me? - Mm-hm. Being a warrior... won't make you a great man... if you are chained to anger and vengeance. Superstition and fear are chains too, and there are others. To be a great man... you have to break free of them all. But how do I do that? I can't see inside me. I can. And I see the heart of a great man, Bilal. You'll find the way. Guidance will come. You'll see. No chains will hold you. No chains. (SOFT MUSIC) You were wrong, Mother. I am a slave. And I will always be in chains. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (GASPS) Why did they have to whip you? You didn't do anything! It does not matter. Master Umayya can do whatever he wants with us. Bilal... look at what I found. I know you didn't mean to lose this. You can still use it to make an offering. I heard the priest say big blessings can come from small gifts. I don't need it. I'm never gonna hope for anything again. I am a slave, and no god in the market has the power to change that! All right. I'll keep it. And I won't spend it either. It's yours. I'll keep it safe for you until you ask for it back.

You need more than money to be the best at what you do. - You need a great deal of determination. - Ha. Right. So your determination is to hunt fruit? I have to get back. Believe me, you do not want to upset Master Umayya. (SOFT MUSIC) Tell me something, Bilal... why don't you just start riding and keep on going? - Across those dunes to wherever they may lead. - And find my palace? More likely I'd find it only to end up working in it. See you later, apple hunter. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. - (COINS JINGLE) - (GASPS) - Here. For your troubles. Till next time, my friend.

(DELICATE MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRP) (HUMS TUNE) You would rather pay from your own pocket than to see this god lose its wealth? I wanted to spare the boy a beating. Ah. Then you care more for a beggar boy than an idol? Don't you believe the promises of the priests? My apologies, sir. I am just a slave and know no better. Don't you? Or do you? You're no priest. You're... the lord of merchants... - Al-Siddiq. - Indeed. Are you kneeling because you thought I was a priest? Or was it my question that frightened you? Get up, son. Do not be afraid. (CHUCKLES) No, sir. I am not frightened. - You seem amused. - Your Honour, what do you know about fear? I have seen enough of it in the eyes of the people. Enough to understand what makes slaves of the many. A woman is afraid she will bear a girl. She pays an offering and begs the idols to fix it. A rich man fears poverty. He shares a little of his money with the gods and promises more if they help him stay wealthy. An old man fears death, so he pays a priest for deliverance. (GROANS) This fear compels them to seek refuge in these gods... gods of greed, of injustice... with hope that all of their problems will go away. Surely this sacred structure was not built to house all of this corruption. It was built so that all mankind could stand together as equals... and follow the one creator. - Except for slaves. - Son, no one is born a slave. You were free once, were you not? I was. Once. A long time ago. Devils raided my village... destroyed my home. They took me and Ghufaira... - my sister. - What about your...? She still talks to me. Sir, all this talk of equality... is wishful thinking. It holds no meaning to me, so save your speech for a man who can afford this... thing you are selling. Young man, life is more generous than you may think. - I am not here to sell anything. - It may be, sir, but not for slaves. My master is expecting these. - I must return. - Whom do you serve? Master Umayya, the greatest man in the city. - And what is your name, son? - Bilal. Bilal. I saw greatness in the hand that saved that boy today. And remember, great men are those who have the will to choose their own destiny. (POIGNANT MUSIC) - Yalla! - (WHIP CRACKS) Hurry up! Move it! Right now.

(TENDER MUSIC) SOFTLY: Where is he? (DOOR OPENS) - You are late. - (CHUCKLES) You remember my sister, Ghufaira? My lady. I am Soheib, - first-rate slave and blacksmith extraordinaire. - (CHUCKLES) Yes, a funny man. Where were you? It's almost time for the feast. They will whip you if you are late. Nowhere. The master told me to fetch Safwan. Did he harm you? Hmm. I would have turned this Safwan into a sack of potatoes if I'd only gotten there sooner. That princess. He and that little goon who follows him. You must remain strong, Bilal. They are only as strong as the fear they put inside of us. We must never give in. - All right. Back to work. - Behold... special delivery to your master from my master. (GASPS) That's very shiny. - Mm. Nice work, Soheib. - (LAUGHS) Yes. It's my finest one yet. (INTRIGUING MUSIC) (MEN LAUGH, SHOUT INDISTINCTLY) This Al Siddiq... I cannot believe. This man goes about the city speaking against the gods. Every day. Every day! How many following, I do not know. (MUSIC CONTINUES) You leave too much exposed. You rely too much on luck. (DICE RATTLE) Luck favours the bold. Perhaps. But are you willing to risk it in the real world? - You ask as if you don't know me. - I ask... because I see a threat looming. You are truly obsessed with this nonsense. This 'nonsense' can strike you where you stand, Umayya! Let's make an example out of them, a reminder to those who dare stand against us! After all, we have a business to take care of. Abu Al-Hakam, as always, you have managed to ruin my evening with your concerns. Bilal! Come, sing for us. - Let's lighten the mood. - Ah, yes! I have heard my slaves speaking of this one's voice. Let's hear it! (GROANS) BILAL SINGS: ♪ Distant shadows, ♪ mountains and trees. ♪ Here I stand ♪ as she shelters me. ♪ Distant shadows, ♪ as dark as night. ♪ The sky cries to us all ♪ as it sends down its tears. ♪ Here I stand ♪ as she shelters me. ♪ Distant shadows. ♪ Mother, please hide. ♪ They draw so near. ♪ All these shadows. ♪ Why are they so close? ♪ As the sky sends down... ♪ its... tears.

Look at these dogs, these sinners! They must be disciplined, and so does- - (SLAP!) - Aargh! Argh! - (GRUNTS) - Argh! - And so does who, coward? You call yourselves men? You're a disgrace to Makkah and to your forefathers. Since when were these waters not free for all? And know this... I only see God through the actions of men. (POIGNANT MUSIC) Your savagery today uncovered the true colour of your belief. - So fight me! - (SOLDIERS STAMMER) - Or get out of my sight. - Hamza. - MAN: Bless you, mighty Hamza. - WOMAN: Bless you! Thank you. (ARMOUR CLATTERS LIGHTLY) You arrived just in time, old friend. Al Siddiq. It has been too long. Come. We have much to talk about. Come on, Bilal. Help me get him up. MAN: My people, take as much as you need from the Zamzam well. No soldier will stop you. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRP) (SIGHS) Do you believe change will come, even for us? Maybe. Mother believed so. Why are you asking? Bilal? Hmm. This morning... I went to see him again. (WIND WHISTLES) (GENTLE MUSIC) And who could this be? There are no young thieves to save out here. Sir, what did you mean before? That we choose? Are you offering to buy me? (CHUCKLES) - Would you like me to? - Well, you seem like a better master than the one I serve now. Believe it or not, Bilal, your master is a slave himself. (SCOFFS) Really? - And who is his master? - (CHUCKLES) Greed... the worst of them all. Are you saying that no one is ever free? - I am not. - Then how will I... ever be free? Only you can enslave yourself, Bilal. I... I apologise. I've never been treated with such kindness before, and I still... I don't understand why a noble like you would want... to help someone like me. Is there something you expect me to do in return? You see, Bilal, this man once guided me when I was truly lost, a great and noble man who spreads the message of equality. I have chosen to do the same, so here we stand. And who knows, Bilal? Perhaps one day, you will inspire the hearts of many as well. Me? How can I do that? Come. Sit. You sought me out to talk to me, didn't you? Let's talk. (SOFT MUSIC) So... our mother was right. Yes. She was. It always seemed that way. She was always so very wise. (INSECTS CHIRP) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INSTRUMENTS PLAY SOFTLY) A toast to my son, Safwan. He had the business sense to make a killing on those little idols. Now he can afford to host his first feast. MEN: To his health! Are you still sulking because you passed up a good deal? I told you these portable idols would sell. It may be the last money any of us ever make. What are you talking about? There's a fortune in these little idols. You should have heard the priests hawking them today in the market. You were not there later. - There was a dispute, and the people listened. - A dispute? (GROWLS QUIETLY) Who created this dispute? Wolves from the new movement. Their reputation is spreading like wildfire across the city. Oh, not this business again. If you tell me there's an army coming, I'll worry. What about their talk of freedom? Do you worry about that? - What are you talking about? - They say we are preying on the people's desperation. They say that a real god would never ask for a man's fortune. What happens to our business if this message takes hold? And how long do you think the other merchants will tolerate such a message? They will soon be laughed out of town, or someone will strike a deal with them. You'll see. Look around. There is only one god, and it is money. That is the true faith of this city. Well, these days, not all our merchants are worshipping the idols. Where is that lazy one who used to sell idols in sacks? He joined the movement the other day. And what about the lord of merchants? Where is he? Oh, joined them too, a long time ago. (GROWLS QUIETLY) (TENSE MUSIC) SLURS: Abu Al-Hakam is right. (CHUCKLES) People still buy my date idols, but I think they're eating them for dessert! (CHUCKLES) (SNARLS) Are there any other traitors in my house?! Well?! Stand and reveal yourselves! (TENSE MUSIC) Maybe you should ask your slave. What? What are you talking about? Slave. Why don't you tell my father about your new-found friend? Impossible. You must be mistaken. There are no traitors in my household. Right, Bilal? Speak up. Safwan has accused you of something. What do you have to say for yourself? I said speak up, slave! You have my permission to talk! (CLANG! INDISTINCT CHATTER) We are... all... born... equals. We breathe the same air. We bleed the same colour. And we'll die... and be buried... beneath the same ground. (POIGNANT MUSIC) I believe... I am as free a man... as you are. Free? Equal? I hate these words. Umayya, this one woke up on the wrong side of the ground today. (CHUCKLES) Free?! Equals, huh?! Oh, everyone! Look here! We are both equals! (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) You once slapped my face because I let a slave make a fool of you. What are you going to do now, Father? (WHISPERING) (OMINOUS DRUM MUSIC) Guards!

HAMAMA: I see the heart of a great man, Bilal. - GUARD: Renounce your claim! - (GRUNTS) No one is to touch this slave. Umayya's orders. Renounce your claim, slave! - I will... not. - (WHACK!) - (SCREAMS) GHUFAIRA: Bilal, are you all right? SOHEIB: You must remain strong, Bilal. SAFWAN: A master breeds a master and a slave breeds a slave. BILAL: A great warrior! AL SIDDIQ: All humanity is a single nation. GHUFAIRA: Bilal, are you all right? For those who look outside... only dream. HAMAMA: Guidance will come. You'll see. (POIGNANT MUSIC) UMAYYA: And what is the difference between you... - GUARD: Renounce your claims. - ...and this apple? - ECHOES: Renounce! SAFWAN: Kneel when you come before me, slave.

You're braver than I thought. I take credit for that. It comes from watching me all these years, I'm sure. GHOSTLY WHISPER: Why don't you just die? It took guts to reveal yourself like that. But sadly, you still think like a slave. I'll get you back on track with a little secret. See, I never believed in these gods. No, no, no, no, I'm not a fool. The truth is we are both slaves, Bilal. The difference between us is I worship whatever empowers me. You... - worship something that will destroy you. - (WHACK! EERIE HISSING, RATTLING) A free man would have sought out the profit in this situation. For example, a free man might offer to spy on his master's enemies. He might realise the advantage in that. Do you understand what I'm saying, Bilal? Get him some water. (SLURPS) Should I take off these chains? - What do you say, Bilal? - My chains... are already off. That's funny, because I see them. - Or does your invisible god make other things invisible too? - I'm talking about the chains... - in here. - Stop talking in riddles. Do you know how much trouble you're in? I could have you killed right now. It doesn't matter what you do to me. And there's nothing you can give me. I am... already free. And what about your sister? Is she free too? So, are you going to consider my proposition or not? You wanted a horse. I will give you two, and I will provide both you and your sister a home. GHOSTLY WHISPER: Accept his offer. - (DISTANT SHOUTING) - MAN: Where is the slave? - MAN: Bring him out here! - MAN: Bring him! - MAN: Bring him out! This is why you are a slave while I am rich; you don't recognise when you have been given an opportunity. Too bad. Then... kill me. - I'm not going to kill you. - (CROWD CLAMOUR, CHEER) - Yet you might still die. (GRUNTS) (DRAMATIC, OMINOUS MUSIC) (CROWD YELL, CHEER) (GRUNTING) Your time has come.

Is he stronger than my gods? For with their power and mine, I can have you killed - or set free. - Release him! - This... - is my god. - You can't do this! Do you want it to come to your aid? Accept, and I will ask it to absolve you of your sins. - I've already offered a fair price for him. - Very fair. Then what is the reason for bringing him out here? (EERIE MUSIC) (GROANS) WOMAN: Crush him! (SINISTER MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) If you injure him, then he is of no value to me and the deal is off. - We'll see. - This slave has been charged with the most heinous of crimes. He stands against his masters. For this offence, he will be punished. - (CLICKING) - GHUFAIRA: Have mercy! Please! Please! (GRUNTS) (HEAVES, STRAINS) No! You will kill him! (GROANS) Argh! (MOURNFUL MUSIC) He will die, Safwan! Please, no! Feel that... slave? Give up, Bilal. You can end this. Cry for forgiveness and accept us as your real masters... - and these as your true gods. - (GROANS, STRAINS) How many gods are there? Can you count, slave? (GROANS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) One. Only... one. (GRUNTS) (STRAINS, PANTS) (MOMENTOUS MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (GASPS) It can't be. (WIND WHISTLES) - You are a fool! - WEAKLY: I... am... free. (GROANS) Aaargh! No, no. Bilal! Please! Stop! He will die! I will double the offer. I think you've lost your head for business. Sold! Remove the stone. - (GRUNTS) - (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS, GASPS) Ugh! SAAD: Bilal! I would have given all I own for him. - For a slave? - No. For a brother. Don't tell me that this new movement makes slaves and nobles brothers. (LAUGHS) Can you believe it? (LAUGHS) It does. (FLAGS FLAP) - Easy. Easy. - (GRUNTS) GHUFAIRA: Bilal, talk to me. His sister. - I'll pay the same for her. - UMAYYA: You're asking the wrong person. I gave her to Safwan as a gift. - (PANTS) - I won't sell her... not even for your whole business. - Take her. - GHUFAIRA: No! - What is the meaning of this? - Unhand her! - Stop. - Bilal! - WEAKLY: Ghufaira. (GASPS) (GENTLE MUSIC) I will forever be grateful, for you have saved my life. AL SIDDIQ: To save one life, my brother, is like saving all humanity. - (GRUNTS) - So, how does it feel to walk the streets of Makkah - as a free man? - (SIGHS) It feels good just to be walking. - (CHUCKLES) - Where's Soheib? With Hamza and the lord of merchants. They wait for us at the gate. (INTRIGUING MUSIC) AL SIDDIQ: Word of your defiance makes its way through all the city. Umayya and his slave masters will come for you, Bilal. We must leave. - BILAL: Where will we go? - To a great city, one that welcomes us with open arms. (HISSES) (DESOLATE MUSIC) (TAIL RATTLES) (SNAKE HISSES, FALCON SHRIEKS) (SHRIEKS) (CALLS) (CAMEL GRUNTS) (GENTLE MUSIC) Attractive, isn't it? Man crafted the blade to hunt and provide food for his family. These days, men use it to break each other. Hmm. Its true purpose and value... - has been lost. - Will you teach me how to fight? Why? You think if you had wielded a weapon, the outcome might have been in your favour? Or do you seek to take what you desire with a sword? Remember, I can only show you how to use it. But you alone must decide where... and when. Violence does not always solve disputes. Do not allow yourself to be lured into a battle you can avoid. (BLADE SWOOSHES) - When do we start? - As soon as you put back the sword and pick up that stick. (CURIOUS MUSIC) (SIGHS) Hmm. (ACTION MUSIC) Hmm. (GRUNTS) Argh! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (PANTS) (GROWLS) (GRUNTS) - (PANTS) - (CHUCKLES) Saad! (CURIOUS MUSIC) All right. Let's try some sparring. - Show me what you've got, rookie. - Ha. After you, apple hunter. - (CHUCKLES) - (BOTH GRUNT) Turn, Bilal. Duck. Now parry. As we practised, Bilal. As we practised. (MEN GRUNT, GROWL) (INTRIGUING MUSIC) (MUSIC ENDS) (INSECTS CHIRP) - Ghufaira? - (DISTANT HOWL) (GASPS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (HORSES GRUNT, WHINNY) (HORSE NEIGHS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC CONTINUES) (HORSE NEIGHS) (BLADE RINGS) (WHIMPERS) (PANTS) Argh! (SIGHS) (CRICKETS CHIRP) (SIGHS) (BOTH GRUNT, BLADES CLANG) Argh! Ugh! - (PANTS) - Ha. Beat you again. (CHUCKLES) Come. - Get up. - (GRUNTS) Let's spar when you cool down, Bilal. AL SIDDIQ: Never strike in anger. We will free her, Bilal. Do not lose hope. (BOTH GRUNT) He who conquers his anger is strong. He who forgives when having the power to seek revenge will witness glory. I promise... I will try harder. Promise me to train this. True strength is in the mind, Bilal, not in the weapon. And that is Hamza's secret. One day, you will discover your own secret. (INTRIGUING VOCAL MUSIC) (MEN URGE HORSES, HORSES WHINNY) (DISTANT CHEERING) Hyah! (VOCAL MUSIC CONTINUES) (SIGHS) Bilal! It's Bilal! (CHILDREN GIGGLE) (GASPS) - Come with me! - Hey. - We will take you to your home! - (CHILDREN LAUGH) - CHUCKLES: Wait. Let go. (LAUGHTER) Where are you taking me? (GENTLE MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) (SERENE MUSIC) BILAL: Mother, watch me build a home. (MEN GRUNT) (CHILDREN GIGGLE) Watch us build a house where we can gather to spread hope... hope to inspire the hearts of men. (UPLIFTING MUSIC) He asks that you call out to them... Master Bilal. (SOFT STRING MUSIC) From here, I will call them. Show me. Show me how your voice will inspire... how it will be raised to speak for justice... and equality. (UPLIFTING MUSIC) What I feared is happening, Umayya. They're growing in strength and numbers. - Are we to stand here and do nothing? - He is right, Father. When a slave defies his master, the world turns upside down. GHOSTLY WHISPER: Kill them. Kill them all. Kill them. (TENSE MUSIC) We will begin here. Tonight. Assemble a great army to crush each and every place that shelters them. Let it start with our own households. Root them all out... and kill them. GHOSTLY WHISPER: Kill them all. - WOMAN: Towards the gate! - MAN: Hamza is back with more refugees. (CAMELS BELLOW) - (WHINNIES) - (LAUGHS) Magnificent horse, Bilal. It followed us on our way back. Do you know him? I do. We are old friends. (CLICKS TONGUE) He was once owned by Umayya. Hmm. Seems he has escaped his oppression as well. Take good care of him. MAN: The old man brings news from Makkah! MAN: The persecution... grows worse every day. We have lost so much. But we were lucky. We have escaped. The ones who remain, I fear, may soon lose their lives. A message for you, from the son of Umayya. (TENSE MUSIC) (GASPS, WHISPERS) Ghufaira. - Where is Bilal? - He's over there, by that... - (HORSE NEIGHS) Hyah! - (GRUNTS) Hyah! - (NEIGHS) (DRAMATIC DRUM MUSIC) (HORSE PANTS) (ARMOUR CLANKS) (GROWLS) (GRUNTING, SCREAMING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) (SCREAMS) (SOLDIER YELLS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) (FIRE ROARS) (HORSES WHINNY) (HORSES WHINNY) (ALARMING MUSIC) (DISTANT SCREAMING) Hmm. (BABY CRIES) My child. - Where are the rest of you? - We are the only ones left. (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) - BILAL: Yah! - (HORSE WHINNIES) Hyah! (HORSE PANTS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) - (NEIGHS) - Ghufaira! Ghufaira! GUARD: Take 'em outside. Follow me. Please! Have mercy! - (GRUNTS) - A slave! Get him! (GRUNTING) - Ugh! - (NEIGHS) (WHACK! GRUNTS) Grab him! You've made a grave mistake coming back here, boy. - Get him up! - (GRUNTS) Where is your god now? (GROANS) Wait! - (PANTS) - (CHUCKLES) (COIN RINGS) (CLINK! CLINK! CLINK!) (DRAMATIC, SORROWFUL MUSIC) - WHISPERS: Ghufaira. - Proceed. Time to meet your god. - (SPEAR WHOOSHES) - Aargh! (INTENSE MUSIC) (WHINNIES) (MEN GRUNT, BLADES CLASH) Come! (MOURNFUL VOCAL MUSIC) I'm not leaving without you. Hurry. (GRUNTS) (SOLDIERS YELL IN DISTANCE) (BLADE CLASHES, SOLDIERS GRUNT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOLDIERS SHOUT INDISTINCTLY) (DISTANT THUNDER) (HORSE PANTS) (FALCON SHRIEKS) (SQUAWKS) - (SQUAWKS) - (GRUNTS) - (SHRIEKS) - (GRUNTS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) I knew I would find you here. I have no words that can make you feel better. I can only ask that you keep your mind clear and your heart true. And rest assured, God will always be there for you, Bilal. I have made this for you. (BLADE RINGS SOFTLY) When you decide to use it, remember not to allow the blade to dictate your choices. AL SIDDIQ: O Lord, all praise and glory belong to you. Upon you we rely... in both hardship and ease. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) These fools band together to overthrow us. I will lead the attack at the front. You must watch over the city. They threaten our control, our power. Do not disappoint me. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC INTENSIFIES) AL SIDDIQ: Protect us from all evil. For there is no might, nor power, - except with you. Amen. - ARMY IN UNISON: Ameen! (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SOLDIERS SHOUT) (MUSIC RISES) You must be joking. (CACKLES) - (YAWNS) - (SIGHS) Most unfortunate. - SOLDIER: Look at their strength. - SOLDIER: They are too many. Stand strong, men. Have faith. Send three of our best in. First, we destroy their morale, then we finish them... one by one. Whatever happens, don't come for us. Stand your ground. (TENSE PERCUSSIVE MUSIC) - Hmm. - SOLDIER: Make way for Ali. - SOLDIER: Make way for Ali. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MUSIC FADES) I'm going to enjoy this.
