Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Amit! Hey, Amit! Get up or you'll be late for school. Brother, have you forgotten that it's Sunday today? You also go back to sleep. - Is it Sunday today? - Yes. I'm sorry. I unnecessarily woke you up. Go to sleep. Where are these kids? They'll come. You didn't bring your younger brother. Where is he? Aunty, have you also forgotten that it is Sunday? Sunday. He's sleeping. Does Sunday come two days in advance now? - What? - He fooled you. He made a fool of me? He's very naughty. Wake him quickly, or he'll be late for school. There's just one advantage of being retired. It makes no difference whether it's a Friday or a Sunday! Amit! You fooled me! You say it's a Sunday on a Friday! You lie! Brother, a small lie is fine, isn't it? It's too early in the morning! - Shall I say something? - Yes. Anybody can fool you! Why? Is it apparent on my face? Because you are too innocent and simple as well. Why insult me in installments? Can't you say it in one go? I enjoy teasing you. Really? You enjoy teasing me? Shall I say something? When you tease me even I enjoy it a lot! Come. Please sit. What an aroma! I think aunty has prepared omelet today. - See? - Brother, aunty is very great. With the omelet, she butters and puts jam on the bread, too! Hey, Amit! Stop buttering me. There's no jam today. No problem. Brother will buy me a chocolate on the way. Aunty, did you see that? After you, I'm his next target! Indeed! He is very smart! He knows how to get his work done! Shall I say something? If you have to survive in this world, you've got to be smart! And to be smart, it's very important to eat chicken. Oh! I understand! I'll surely prepare chicken for you in the evening. Uncle, what does the newspaper say today? How many people... Forget that. Rohit, there's a good news for you. Your boss, the owner of that five star hotel wants to hire a singer for the night. Look, he's advertised for it. Hey! How many jobs will this child do? You remain idle, but employ others! As it is, he works in the day. Will he work in the night, too? - Lady! - What? For once in your life, just listen to what your man says! The job that he does in the day is his livelihood. But, he'll do this job in order to fulfill his dream. What will you understand, you domesticated woman? Music brings happiness to life! He stepped into my motor shop, it's the grace of God. Sometimes, I'd see him, and he... What is the word? Forget it! It's great that you have come here, Sirjee. You have changed all your habits, but you still call me Sirjee! Oh, I forget! Tell me, what brings you here? I want a car. Forget a car. I can even give you my life! Rohit, come here. He's my star salesman! One look at him, and the girls buy the car! And he is my best friend! My companion, my buddy, Saxena! He is a millionaire. Show him a splendid car. Yes, sir. Please come. You are fortunate that various new models have started coming to India. Look at this-a Lexus GS-300. It's the latest model. Please take it, sir. - It's nice but... - Then, please come here, sir. The Mercedes, C-180. It's automatic, and it's color suits your personality, one hundred percent! Take it, sir. What kind of a car would you like to buy? An auto rickshaw, sir. Not you. I know that you will buy only an auto rickshaw! You? Sir, if I had the money, I would like to buy that car. Look, sir. It's small and zooms too! - That's more like it! - Then buy it, sir. I have. It's mine! Rohit, you've spoken to your boss about the singing job, haven't you? Yes, but his son, Atul, handles the hotel business. We'll have to speak to him. Come in. Dad called me. Both of you are here for a singer's job, right? - Yes, sir. - Please listen to us. All right. Get your band, and I'll take the audition. - Band? - Yes, your band. We have no band. I sing, and Tony plays the flute. Please hear us, sir. Look here, friends. This is a five star hotel. All the musical shows here have a band. Electronic gadgets, synthesizers. That's what works in today's world! Please hear us, sir. No way, buddy. This is a hotel business. It's the question of our reputation. It is not a joke. I am sorry. I advise you to go and try a restaurant. Anything for you. What's your program for this evening? Atul is giving a party in my honor at his outhouse. That's fine. But where is my birthday present? It awaits you at the door, my child! - Really? - Go and enjoy your gift! How's the gift, Sonia? Extremely beautiful! How's the color? Clean and immaculate, Dad! Why don't you take a ride? Do you function with a key? That depends on your temperament. What? I don't understand such difficult words! I know. Will you please take a look at your present now? I already am. Wow! What a beauty? - What do you think? - It's very beautiful. But, please don't ruin it with fake embellishments. Because true beauty lies in simplicity. Rohit. Sonia. - What happened to the flute? - It was fine a while ago. Come on, play it. Who is it? Should I give you one? Hey, Rohit! Isn't he our boss' son? Oh, yes! He didn't want to hear us sing, but he will have no choice now! How? - Got it? - But... I have never seen you dressed this way before. Yes, even I realized today that beauty lies in simplicity. - Really? - Yes. Hey! What's the matter with the sound? - Excuse me, Sonia, I'll go and check. - Yes.

Why did you call me here? Because we are in trouble. I think, you have not read the newspapers. The stuff that the police were to burn tonight got burnt last night. - Got burnt? - Yes. But I've taken an advance from the party already! Don't worry. We've managed to salvage stuff worth Rs.100 million. We are worried that somebody may find out. So, have those drugs taken away today. And give us our share. Share! Share! Share! Like always, you will get your share even this time! Lily, hear this! The stuff worth millions which the police had seized, was burnt last night by them. Disgusting! I know it all! They print this only to deceive us! You're worried about the whole world, but not about what we are going to cook at home! Will I boil the newspaper and prepare noodles from it? Rohit hasn't paid this month's rent or the money for food! How am I supposed to manage? What are you saying? If he hasn't yet paid, he will pay later! He must not have got his pay. The expenses are very high now! That's exactly what I'm saying! The prices have skyrocketed! Everybody comes to eat, but how am I supposed to manage? - What's this? - My piggy bank. Take all the money, but don't speak ill about brother! What did you say? What did you say? A small boy like you flaunts money to me! What do you think I am? Come on, eat your breakfast! No! I don't want to eat! I don't want to eat. - Hey, Amit! Listen! - Hey Amit. - Come back! - Amit, listen to me! What's the matter, aunty? Amit is angry with me. He didn't even have breakfast, he's left without eating. I'll go and see. Amit, why did you leave without having your breakfast? Aunty is so upset. What's the matter? Then why does she talk ill about you? What did she say? That you haven't paid her. - She isn't wrong. - Yet, I don't approve of that. Amit, there's something called helplessness. I'm helpless because I'm unable to pay aunty. And she is helpless because she doesn't have money to run the house. You have seen her temper, not her tears. She is like our mother. Like our mother, but she's not our mother. But she is no less than a mother. Brother, why did our mother leave us? What do I say? The truth is that even I don't know. Perhaps it was our destiny. Perhaps it was God's will. But, I promise you one thing. I will never ever let you feel their absence. Whom are you doing this for? How did you know? The way both of you were looking at each other last night. Sending messages with the eyes! Am I right? A little. But, I don't want to come. What? But, I'm not in the mood! Fine! Don't come! Neither will Rohit! What? Rohit? Yes! Rohit will also be coming with us on the cruise. I've engaged him as a singer. I have already paid him Rs.10,000 as advance money. You're coming now, aren't you? When did I ever refuse? Rohit has still not come! Now what, Atul? It's time for the ship to leave. - Suppose he doesn't come, then? - Stop talking rubbish! He must be on his way. There's no chance of him coming now. I've lost my Rs. 10,000, too! Stupid! You're more concerned about your money! Stupid. Fool. He missed the ship! All my planning has gone down the drain! Now, what will I do alone on this stupid ship? Why did he do this! Why did he do this! Rohit is here! Rohit is here! Rohit is here! Rohit!

I was so afraid. Why were you late? Why were you late? Late? I had reached here three hours earlier. What? Actually, I was unable to sleep the whole night. Me, too. - It's the first time, isn't it? - What happens the first time? There's restlessness and a feeling of joy as well. You are voicing my feelings. - You, too? - I just cannot tell you. Sometimes I feel that... all the stars in the sky have fallen on my lap. And sometimes I feel that... What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Leave him alone. Enough now. Go from here. Go! Am I looking fine? There's nobody here. So where were we? I think, you were talking about the stars. Forget about me, tell me what you were thinking about. What do I say? I never thought my dream would be realized. What? Has your dream been realized? Not fully, but at least, it has begun. Even I feel a little... But, you must have gone on a cruise many times. - And seen many ships, too. - Ship? Were you talking about the cruise and ship until now? Yes. What did you think? I thought... well, you... you... me... What's this? You've got me totally smitten! You are present in every breath I take! Write your name on my heart. - What? - I mean here. I knew this scene was inevitable but, not so soon! Just look at the way he's writing his name on her heart! Not her heart, he's writing it on her hand! Yes! The matter begins with the hand only! Excuse me. Hey, Sonia! Listen to me! Let's go. My parents are waiting for you over tea. - What? - Let's go. Please! My young, pudgy brother, I am in the land of dreams here. Let alone the ship, the entire city seems to be running over water! I miss you terribly. If I ever become successful, I'll surely take aunty, uncle and you on a cruise. Hey, guess what! Do you remember the girl at the signal? She's also on this ship. Her name is Sonia, but all her friends here call her Miss J! She is so irritable and gets angry at the drop of a hat! Who does he think he is? He isn't the only boy in this world! He flirts in front of me! I'll show him what flirting is! He doesn't know me! It must be him! He must have come to apologize! - You! - Why? Were you expecting somebody else? When you're around, can I expect anybody else? You have made my evening by coming here! You are sounding quite different! Just watch! I will drive you crazy. Aren't you ready yet? Will you wear this and go to the party? Hey, get up! Hurry! Will you wear this coat to the party? Why not? This is my best Sunday coat. I bought it from the flea market. I wear this even to the church. - It won't do here. - Then, what will do? Read this. The dress code is a DJ. DJ? A dinner jacket. Which means a bow and a suit. Do we have that? We don't. Does that mean, we cannot go to the Christmas party? Sit. Both of us will celebrate Christmas. Idea! Free pressing. You keep watching it. I wish you a merry Christmas. Laundry, brother. Wow! Look who's here! Me, too. This rose is for you on my behalf. This rose is for you on my behalf. One does not give someone a gift presented by somebody else. Exactly! One does not give someone a gift presented by somebody else! But Sonia, what will I do with this rose? It looks so beautiful in your hand. But you know... you know that I am... allergic to roses! - This is for you. - Me? This rose has travelled the hall and come here! It's befitting only on you. Please take it. Thank you. But, how did you find out my name? This is called the magic of love! Fire brigade! Take this. What's happening! Where did you get these clothes from? I think it belongs to the magicians. They were to perform. Mr. Atul, Merry Christmas. What happened? Won't you wish me a Merry Christmas? Your face has become a poster! There's no space left to wish! Sonia! Sonia! He tries to act too smart! His face is fully covered with lipstick marks! And he wants me to wish him! - Who does he think he is? - Sonia! - What are you doing there? - Why are you shouting from there? If you're a man, come here and talk! What are you doing? Can't you see at night? I'm drinking! What's the occasion? Why are you bothered if I drink in joy or in sorrow? Go and flirt with those stupid girls! But what can I do if girls run after me? - Indeed! Girls are after you! - Yes. Have you seen your face? You look like a baboon! What did you say! One minute! And what were you doing? Openly flirting with Atul! Why? Were you offended? Why should I feel offended? Do as you please! What are you doing? Can't you see at night? I'm drinking! Hey! If you finish my bottle, then I will finish you off! Finished! What's wrong? Ship? Where's the ship? Can't you see in the day either? It's gone! - Gone? It left us behind! - Yes. - It left us behind! - Yes. You are responsible for all this! If you had not drunk at night, you wouldn't have been tipsy, nor would you have sat on this boat! Mister! You're forgetting one thing! If you had not flirted, I wouldn't have drank! Neither would I have been tipsy nor would I have come here on this boat! I think, you're still high! You talk nonsense! You don't know the trouble we are in! Trouble? Where is the trouble? Blue, blue skies above, gusty breeze! Water on all sides! Indeed! When you feel thirsty, drink this saline water! When you feel hungry, eat the gusty breeze! And when you feel cold at night, wrap the blue, blue skies! Why are you shouting? If people hear you, what will they say? That you are crazy! And anyway, who will hear us? There's nobody here! You speak, and I'll listen. Just shut up and let me. Think what to do! Shall I tell you what to do? Let's play hide-and-seek. Be quiet! - Did you find out anything? - No. For how long will I keep rowing? I don't see any shore! Island! Look, there's an island over there! Bravo! Go on! Bravo! Go on! - Bravo! Go on! - Hey ma'am, don't scream! One swat, and you'll stop doing that! Swat? My, my! What a romantic word! I've heard it for the first time. Where did you learn that word from? Darn! Romance in everything! What are you looking at? Get down and push! She keeps rattling like a parrot! Come on, push! She's gone crazy! Is somebody here? Hey, wait! This is so lovely! Right, Rohit? Just like Adam and Eve, both of us are together in this Eden, much before the world came into existence. Remove your skirt. What! Skirt? Have you taken me so seriously? We are not the actual Adam and Eve! Listen to me, and remove your skirt! What! Are you crazy? You are trying to take advantage of a beautiful girl in a desolate place? Heartless, shameless! - That's it! I don't know any more words! - You won't listen! No! Don't touch me! Rohit! Leave me! Rohit, what are you doing? Leave me! What have you done? What are you doing? Can't you see I'm hoisting a flag? A flag? But why? If they come to search for us, they may see this flag. And they'll know that we are somewhere nearby. Maybe, we'll be saved. Understood? But, I don't want them to come and disturb us. - I don't want to go back. - Meaning? I'm happy here extremely happy! Look there! Our tree house will be built atop that hill! We'll stay there! You will leave for work in the morning and I will wait for you. And at dusk, when you return tired after cutting the logs, I will look at you and smile. You will light the firewood, and I'll keep watching you. Yes. Then I will sing you a lullaby and put you to sleep. I'll wake you at dawn by singing 'Raag Bhairavi'. And when you still won't wake up then I'll give you two slaps! Slaps? How mean! Why will you slap me? A person needs to be slapped to snap him out of his dreams! Hey! Where are you going? To fetch a hamburger from McDonalds! Will you eat one? Yes. But get me a vegetarian one. Hey, helicopter! Oh, no! It was over here? Where's the flag? Hey, Sonia! What are you doing? Catching fish for dinner. - With that flag? - Yes. I had put up the flag as a signal! The search party came and left! - Foolish girl! - You called me foolish? Yes, I did! You are a foolish, crazy, haughty girl! You push me! Huh? - Push you? I'll kill you! - You'll kill me? Here! Help! He's actually drowning! Rohit! Rohit. Rohit. Rohit. Oh my God! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit. Rohit. Rohit! You're all right, aren't you? Thank God. Stupid. Fool! When you can't swim, why did you dive into the water? I was just kidding! Why did you risk your life for me? Why? Answer me. Because I love you. What? What did you say? Say it again! Why? Did I say something wrong? Repeat what you said! I love you. - Say it again. - What? - Say you love me. - I said I love you. That's it!

I'm looking for a face in them. Whose? My mother's. I don't understand. Mom used to say that... when someone close dies... then he turns into a star. Even I lost my mother in childhood. - Will she also... - She must have also become a star. And today, these stars have brought light into our lives. Then, make me a promise. That this light will burn bright in our hearts forever. I promise. Like these stars, forever! What are you doing? - Hoisting a flag. - Why? So that I can return to the city and tell the whole world that I love you. What's wrong? - Today, I don't want to go back. - What are you saying! Yes, Sonia. Because in that city and world, there are many barriers between us. Where are the barriers? I don't see any. Tell me now, is there any barrier? Malik, sack Rohit right away! Don't worry, Saxena. I have already decided to do that. And I will also try and see that he doesn't get a job anywhere else. Let him roam in the streets! Dad, I have never seen this side of you. Dad, I cannot tell you how nice Rohit is! You don't know him. Your hatred for him prevents you from knowing him better! There is no need for me to know him! I know you, and I know myself! I have decided that you will go to New Zealand, to my brother. To complete your studies. I have made all the arrangements. Okay? Sonia, here's your passport and ticket. I have spoken to brother. They'll come to receive you at the airport. I know that you are feeling miserable now. But try and understand that we are poles apart. Rohit! Do you see the difference? You are in a luxurious car, and he rides a godforsaken cycle! Look! He is on land, and you are... There's no difference now, right daddy? Great! He took away Sonia right before your eyes, and you just kept watching! You didn't even try and stop him! Malik, I had no time to think! I thought my daughter... Anyway, it's still not too late. Inform the police immediately. Or they'll get married and come here to seek your blessing. You are wrong, sir. We sure have come back. But, we didn't get married. Eloping and marrying would be belittling our love, sir. I love Sonia, and I respect my love. I will marry her, only when I start earning. And I guess you need my help for that? No, sir. I don't need your help. I have confidence and faith in myself. Rohit, I am very impressed with your talks and feelings. I am really, really impressed. I promise, if you succeed in your purpose, then I'll willingly give my daughter's hand in marriage to you. Before leaving, I would like to tell you something. Do not consider me coming here, a weakness. I entrust Sonia to you as a possession. I will be honest, and so will you. I promise that I will definitely be honest. Anyway, honesty is my profession. Am I right, Malik? Indeed! Rohit, what you did was absolutely correct! - And I'll help you. - But how? He has his voice, and we'll take it to the people. Will he stand at Churchgate station and sing? No. But, he can at least stand on the stage and sing. Idea. We'll record his voice on a cassette and distribute it in all the colleges! - And discos too! - And near traffic signals as well! When his voice gets popular, we'll have a stage show. Fantastic! And I'll organize the show! This is called a stroke! Well, Rohit is the one hitting strokes! Go anywhere in the town, and it's Rohit! I think, he will succeed in achieving his goal! And you will be forced to fulfill your promise! Malik, I made the promise, after giving it much thought. We will decide his success and goal. And his goal is still very distant. This is Shinde speaking. I just met Commissioner Verma. He's been enquiring a lot about you. I fear, he may take some action against you. Don't worry. Before he can do that, fix a meeting between us. Sonia. Rohit. Sonia, why have you come here? I'm meeting you after so many days. Please don't ask questions. Just let me feel the experience of being with you. Rohit, I cannot live without you for even a moment now. When you are not with me, nothing seems good. And, do you think I can live without you? I don't know why I am feeling scared today. Aren't you feeling the same? I used to feel scared. Whenever I'd wonder whether I'd be able to sing before people or not... I used to feel really scared. But you've filled my heart with so much love today, that there's no place for fear. I am not at all scared today. Sonia, we will be victorious. There is no need for us to feel scared. Because you are with me. And I'm with you. And with us, are the stars. And us as well! Luck is also with us! All the tickets for the show are sold! Oh, I forgot something! What's the time? Five o'clock. I had to pick up Amit. Do you have your motorbike? - Yes. - May I borrow it? - Here. - Thanks. - I'll be back in a jiffy. - Come back soon. I will wait for you. Welcome, Mr. Commissioner. I'm grateful to you for making time to meet me. Even I wanted to meet you, but not at such an unsuitable place. This is indeed quite an unsuitable place. But, secrets are let out only at such places. Your secrets are no more a secret. Because I very well know that most of the stuff disposed of from my department to be set ablaze, reached you instead! So why don't you arrest me? I have come here to do that, Mr. Malik. But if you become the State witness and reveal the names of the men from my department who supply drugs to you, then I can have your sentence reduced. You are indeed talking about my well-being. But if I reveal the names before these officers, will it be safe? Of course! Both of them are reliable! Rohit! Sirjee, Rohit has witnessed it all! Kill him. Drive faster, faster! Hit it! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Everybody is here, but there's no sign of Rohit! - Sonia! - Rohit! Rohit! - Sonia! Rohit is... - Yes? - What's wrong? - Rohit has met with an accident! No! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! - Please wait! You can't go ahead. - Where's Rohit? Where is my Rohit? What happened to him? He fell in the water? But, Rohit cannot swim! Atul, Rohit cannot swim! Please save him! - Sonia. Sonia. - Save Rohit! He cannot swim! Sir, we didn't find the body. Rohit! Amit! My child! Doctor, why doesn't he say anything? What does he blankly stare at? Rodriquez. What has happened to our children? Why did God do this? Why? Why did God do this? ♪ My heart says ♪ ♪ Our union ♪ ♪ Is memorable forever ♪ ♪ Say I love you ♪ ♪ Say I love you ♪ Saxena, I have some very good news for you. Kadam and Shinde have had closed the commissioner's case, saying that he was killed in an encounter. There! We've won this case, too! Malik, this victory... has devastated a father. It's been a month now. Sonia has become lifeless, grieving for Rohit. As if life has severed ties with her. My friend! Time heals all wounds! Change her surroundings. Send her somewhere far away. You may be right. I'll send her to my brother. - Sonia! - Why are you shouting? - Sonia! Sonia! Dad, where is Sonia? - She must be in her room. - She isn't! That's why I'm asking you! - Careful! Don't worry, Dad. I'm destined to keep falling! Sonia, why are you standing here? We have to go out! Come on! We'll be late. I'm not in the mood, Nita. You carry on. Oh God! What do you mean by you're not in the mood? Do you know, Sonia, you've been here for two weeks, and you've not stepped out of the house even once? I don't care. We are going out. And for God's sake, please get out of that 'Salwar'. Hey! By the time this signal turns to green, I'll call mother and inform her that we'll be late. Okay? Rohit? I told mother that we'll return by two o'clock. What's wrong, Sonia? I'm not feeling too well. If you want to go, please carry on. You're too much! This is New Zealand's best disco!

She will be staying with us for some days. If seems as if the Taj Mahal itself has come here! India must have become prosperous. Idiot! Not prosperous but empty! I mean, it must've become desolate. Sonia, don't mind what he says. He's got a passion for speaking in Urdu! You won't believe it, he's been trying to learn Urdu since a child. But, he has still not succeeded! - Hello, aunty! - Hello. I am Sonia, Nita's cousin. I have come from India. I wanted to meet Raj. He has just left to go skiing. Please come in, my dear. Why are you standing there? For how long have you been staying here? We left India around 25-26 years ago. We came here after marriage, and settled here. Didn't any of you ever go back to India? We never got a chance. Raj was born a year after we got married. Raising him, his school and college, my husband's business. Time just went by. And Raj? Did he ever go to India? No, my dear. Raj has never been to India. And anyway, whom will he go to? Hi! How are you? When I was born, the priest had said 'Nita is, where injury is!' But, why is she absent in your presence? Who? Oh. Sonia! She disappeared in the morning, that's why I'm quiet. But, why are you so pensive? - Because of your cousin Sonia. - Why? What has she done? Wherever I look, I see her! That's funny. But you've only seen her. I'm unable to fathom a thing. One look from her has worked wonders! Nita, I just can't tell you the way she was looking at me! I just cannot forget those eyes that held so many questions. There were so many things apparent on her face. And then, the way she just walked away. If you were to say the same to Sonia, she'd have fallen unconscious! Nita. You've got to help me. I want to meet her, get to know her, I want to tell her something, I want to hear something! If this is the case, then I will have to help you. At the waterfront this evening. All right? What? A girl from India had come to meet Raj? And her questions seemed like she wanted to decide something about Raj. Amazing! Raj has never mentioned her! There he comes. Welcome, gentleman! What are you hiding from us? Who is that girl? Girl? Which girl? Stop pretending! Sonia had come to meet you. - Sonia! - Yes. Yes. - The one who's come from India? - Yes! - She was here! - Yes, she was! It appears that the flame burns bright on both sides! There's no flame! All right. It seemed so from her talks. What do you think? Of course. What did it seem like, from her talk? You're caught! Dad... Do you think she must be also feeling the same way that I do? Yes. This is what love is. - Is this love? - Yes. - I don't believe it. Mom, is this love? - Hmm. Yes. Hey!

I say you have to face things bravely. You'll have to live for at least the ones who love you, if not for yourself. Then, see how amazing life is! And who knows, when and how a miracle takes place? A miracle has already taken place, Nita. That's why I'm scared. You don't know the game that fate is playing with me. I hadn't even got over grieving for Rohit. And in front of me was... - What are you doing here? - This is called coincidence. Coincidence number three. This is our third meeting. Right? Hey! What's the matter with her? - Does my face appear fine? - Let me take a look. Yes, it's perfectly fine. - Then why does she run on seeing me? - I'll go and see. Sonia! Sonia! Why did you run away like a fool? Sonia, Raj is a very nice boy. He also hails from a good family. Girls covet him, but you're the one he's crazy about. Please, Nita. Don't say such things. I don't like it. Why don't you like it? What's the matter with you, and what are you doing to yourself? You will have to forget the past and live in the present. But, the same Raj does not let me forget my past! Whenever I see him, my past stares right into me! Raj! What does Raj have to do with your past? He does! He has a lot to do with my past! Because Raj looks just like Rohit! And whenever I see Raj... I think about my Rohit! What did you say? Rohit looks like me! Really? So even he has two eyes, one nose, one mouth and two ears, right? There is nothing to laugh about. That's why, she runs away when she sees you. She says that your face tortures her. She doesn't want to meet me. These are only excuses. They are not excuses, Raj. I have seen Rohit's pictures for myself. The same eyes, the same nose, the same face. I'd like to see those pictures. Where's Sonia? I am here! Hey! Where's he gone? Stop laughing! You scared me! You got scared! Suppose I were to look this way, then? Then I'd have looked at you in the same manner! And suppose I looked this way? Then I'd have looked at you in the same fashion! And suppose this is how I were to look, then? Then this is how I'd have looked at you! You can barely see your nose! How would you have looked at me? I don't need eyes to see you. I can see you even with my eyes shut. Do you love me so much? I love you so much that you are all I can see everywhere. And how much do you love me? I love you so much, that whenever you'll open your eyes, you'll find me before you. You'll see me. I would like to see Rohit's pictures. That's enough, Sonia! I want to see how my face tortures you! How it reminds you of Rohit! Look at this! And this too! My face! Even I had thought, how could this be possible? When I saw you for the first time, I felt that my Rohit had come back. That he got saved from drowning. My happiness knew no bounds thinking that my Rohit had returned! But when I realized that you were not my Rohit... then... then I lost it again. I had heard that two faces look alike. But such an uncanny resemblance! That life has played on me. I fell in love for the first time, Dad. And I lost her, even before I could win her. Because my face reminds her of Rohit! She doesn't want to meet me. She runs away from me, Dad! No lover in this world must have ever faced such a dilemma! Where his own face has let him down! You tell me Dad... what's my fault? What do I do, Dad? What do I do? As far as I know you, you have never conceded defeat in life. You have always got, what you've wanted. You love her, don't you? Nita! Nita! Hi, aunty. Is Nita at home? No. She has gone to see off Sonia at the airport. Airport! You. You have followed me even here? And what's this? Well, some people see my face and flee. Therefore, I had to take the hint from this moustache. I mean, I had to take the help of this moustache. However, if this isn't enough, then I have brought a beard, too. Stop all this nonsense, Raj. Remove all this! Okay. Okay. If you are offended, then I'll remove it. But I was only trying to make you laugh. Raj, I totally disapprove of jokes. Sonia, I know that you have endured a lot of trauma. I may not even be able to gauge what you must have gone through. But you forget one thing, Sonia. You forget that life is still with you! You are alive. And there surely is a reason and purpose behind it! Which will certainly bring back the smile on your lips. I want to lend you a hand in finding that purpose. The choice is eventually yours. Raj, I wanted to tell you something. It's okay, Sonia. I know what your answer is. Perhaps we were destined to be together only until here. I'll spend the night at some hotel and return on tomorrow's flight. Sonia! These are some of your pictures which I had taken. Perhaps I have no right to them now. But yes! The memories are mine. You take these pictures, I'll take the memories. Driver, stop the taxi! Raj! Come on! Police. Police. Come on! Get up! Inspector Kadam. Kadam, this is weird! I saw Rohit! What? Have they found his body? Not a dead body but a moving one! He's alive! What rubbish? Are you out of your mind? I know that unless I catch him and bring him before you, none of you are going to believe me! Kadam, just do me a favor. Deploy our forces outside Rohit and Sonia's homes. And yes! Tap their telephone lines, too. Where are you calling from? You didn't even inform me about the flight! I have reached Mumbai, and I am fine. I'm on my way. Dad, someone is trying to kill my friend Raj! But where are you now? Near Globe shopping center, is a telephone booth. That's where we are. Don't worry, I'll be there soon. Let me tie that. Yours is a strange city! Anybody gets shot here! I had barely landed in India, and this... If it hadn't missed my heart, I'd have taken off again straight up! There's nobody here. Did you hear it right? At your behest, I had the phones tapped. She had given this address. Kadam, they are somewhere around. What's happening? I don't understand a thing. Some people are trying to kill you. The telephones at my place are tapped! Even I cannot exactly fathom what's happening. Who are they, and why do they want to kill me? I've come to India for the first time, and somebody is firing at me! Neither do I know anybody here. Why would anybody fire at an unknown person? They know this face! What do you mean? Just the way you had wrongly believed that I was Rohit... even they could be misled. They are not trying to kill me, but Rohit! What! Kill Rohit? - Was he involved in any shady issue? - Not at all. He was a very simple boy. - How did he die? - In an accident. He may not have died in an accident, but got killed instead. Got killed? What are you saying! I cannot be certain. However, the present situation indicates so. Or else, why would somebody fire at a stranger? And then, they have tapped the phone at your house. There's certainly something fishy. You saw Rohit and Sonia together at the airport? You then fired at them? And then, you dared to tap the telephones at my house? You pursued them again! Yes, sir. But Kadam was also with me! Kadam, did you see Rohit? No. I did not see Rohit. Because they had disappeared again. Hey! Tell me something. Explain to me how one can see a dead man alive! This is the effect of your drinking! Sir, that is irrelevant! Have I become blind? - I saw him myself! - Shut up, you fool! Had Rohit been alive, we'd have been behind bars now! Because of your stupidity, Sonia has still not come home! Sir? Now go and seek the help of the police force and bring her back! Don't get worked up. We'll find her. They are the same people who were following us last night. Yes. But what are they doing outside my house? Perhaps they are waiting for you to return home. I think he's deploying his men outside. I hope dad is not in danger. - I think we should inform the cops. - Yes. Let's go. What is this? What were you doing inside for the past two hours? What had you eaten? Sleeping pills or food? Did you attend somebody's wedding? You were in for two hours. Does this belong to your father? This is for the officers, not for constables! Hello! Hey! Who's this impertinent fellow? It's all right. Inspector, we are here to lodge a complaint. Really? While coming from the airport last night, a man... Airport. And this is a police station! There are so many facilities at the airport for people, right? They can stand or sit as they wish! There's enjoyment! But here! Hey! - Inspector, we have a problem. - Prob... We've been wanting to tell you something for so long. Can you hear or not? I don't have the strength to hear or understand. I have never controlled before, this is the first time. What is it? We came out of the International Airport - last night, and someone... - Parab. Someone... Yes, Parab. She is Sonia Saxena. She has run away with this boy named Rohit. Make copies of these photos and send it to all the police stations. Remember! Wherever you see them, arrest them immediately! I think, I have seen them somewhere. - Where? - That's what I'm thinking, sir. Think fast! Please don't scream. I'm in such a position that anything can happen. Sir, they are right here! They are right here with me! Come! - Where are they? - They're gone. - Parab! - Yes? - Are you sure it was them? - Yes. Look at it intently! Turn right! Why are the police following us? I can't understand a thing! The police are pursuing us, and so are the hoodlums. Let's go! Hey, Rohit! Hey, Rohit! You're alive, Rohit? Where were you? What happened to you? Answer me! We wept uncontrollably for you! Why did you harass us so much? Answer me! Your younger brother, Amit. He has become mute, hearing about your death. He doesn't speak a word. If he sees you, he'll be thrilled. Come on, let's go. Look, what I've got for you! An airplane! Remember you'd tell Rohit, you can't be a pilot without a plane? So I've brought you one. Look at the way it flies! Amit! Look at this airplane! I've cooked chicken for you. You're very fond of chicken, right? Yes? Inspector Shinde. We are pursuing a hardcore criminal. He's hiding in this area. The police force is looking for him. Come on, go and search! But nobody has come here, sir. That's for me to see. Who is it? - What's wrong? - Is this Rohit's house? Stop joking! Don't you recognize your own house? Sir, we searched the whole house. There's nobody here. What are they doing at your house? Let's go from here. I'll tell you everything. Yes, Tony. And this is the truth. I just can't believe it! This is God's miracle! He looks exactly like Rohit! I feel, the more I think about it, the crazier I'll become! I'll go and arrange for some food. - This is... - Rohit's tune. Right? - But how do you... - The notes are written in his book. And music is my hobby. This was the song which he was going to sing at the show. Do you remember the lyrics of this song? Somewhat ♪ The heart ♪ ♪ Has sent a message ♪ ♪ My destination ♪ ♪ Destination ♪ ♪ Is your love ♪ ♪ You're my anchor! ♪ Tony! Darn! What do I eat? There's nothing to eat here! An egg. How does one prepare it? Is this how you shake an egg in your country? What? I mean break. Is this how you break an egg here? Why? How do they break it in your country? And how do they beat it? And how do they cut onions? Add some green chili, too. Okay? Will you do anything or not? I will! I will eat from your hand! At your fate! Am I wrong? I mean, feet, at your feet! So, what type of an omelet would you prefer? Spanish, Japanese, cheese, bacon, ham? God, help me. ♪The policeman. ♪ Hey! Where are you going? Can't you see that I'm the milkman? I've been here for four days, but I've never seen you before. That must have been my pop my father must have come here. Father? But, a lady was here yesterday. A lady? That must have been my mother. Does your entire family sell milk? Make me a constable, sir. There's no extra income in selling milk! Go inside! - Milk! - Yes? Whom do you want? I'm the milkman! Tony! Tony! Stop saying Toned milk! And I drink only buffalo milk! Go! - Don't go in! I'll call the police! - Uncle! Hey! Tony, you! What's the matter? I was wondering if Amit... - Sir, there! - Police! She is there. - Get aside. - This way. Get aside. Watch it. Be careful. Get away! Get aside! Get aside. Get aside. Someone get him! Raj! Strange man! Sonia? Oh my God! Sonia, where have you been? Your dad is worried sick about you. All of us are worried about you. - We've been looking for you. - There's an important announcement. This is Sonia Saxena's photo who has been missing from home. The one who provides information about her will be duly rewarded. - She's fair, five feet three inches tall, - Mommy, mommy! - Has black eyes and brown hair. - Let's go! Anyone who sees this girl may contact this number. - 0056789. Thank you. - Manager! She is the one! Stop! Take your positions! Somebody from here reported about a girl. Where is she? - She... - She escaped, sir. - What? - Escaped? And was there a boy with her? Yes, there was. It was this boy? No, he wasn't the one. With whose permission did you flash Sonia's picture on TV? Sir, I felt it was the best option to catch Sonia and Rohit. Rohit, Rohit, Rohit. Are you nuts? Didn't that lady clearly tell you it was some other boy with Sonia? Hey, Kadam! What is the matter with this fool? Looking at your stupidity, I feel like shooting you! Sonia, where are you? I can't tell you, Dad! Your phone has been tapped. And there's a ring of policemen outside the house. I'm perfectly fine. I'll call you again. What's wrong? Have you deployed your force outside my house? Why? - You know that Sonia's life is in danger! - Yes. Then why don't you want her to return home? There are no restrictions on her coming home. It's for Rohit... Rohit again! If you don't stop mentioning Rohit, I'll have you sacked from the Force! Rohit is dead! Sonia! Amit? How have you come here? Brother, I have come to take you home. Come on. No, Amit. It's not advisable for me to come home now. I know. You're afraid that the cops will fire at you again. How do you know that? I had witnessed everything. What? I was waiting for you on the day of your show. You were supposed to take me for it. I wanted to give you a present. So I went to a shop to buy it. When I returned, I saw... Sirjee, Rohit has witnessed everything. Who is Sirjee? Amit, can you identify those three men? Have you seen them before? No. But if I see them, I will be able to identify them. But where will we get to see all three of them together? There is a way to get the three of them together. I will have to come to the forefront. They will think that I'm Rohit and try to attack me again. And then, Amit will identify them. But the question is, how do I come to the forefront? Hey! I have an idea. Why don't we announce the show which Rohit had left incomplete? We'll put posters all over the city saying, Rohit is back! That's a fantastic idea! When they hear about the show, they will have to come here! We'll place TV cameras everywhere - and those what's it called? - Close circuit television. Yes! Amit will identify them on it! But nobody else, other than us, should learn about it. - Atul, let's make the arrangements. - Let's go. Sonia! What's the matter, Sonia? Why are you standing alone? - You are going back. - Going back? - And what about the show? - There will be no show! - I will not let any show take place! - Why not? Don't you want Rohit's killers to be found? Yes, I do! But not at the cost of putting your life in danger! Anything can happen in the show! I'm not bothered about my life. At least, you'll find out the truth. But why do you want to risk your life for me? Why? Because I love you. Look at this! Rohit is back. He's holding a show. All of you slapped me! You thought I was insane! - You threatened to have me sacked! - Shinde... Leave me! I've destroyed my mind by drinking! Right? Now look! See the messenger of your death for yourself! Shinde is so confident. Let's go and take a look. Fine! Let's go! Hats off to your common sense! If he is indeed Rohit and sees all of you together he will identify you. And we'll be in a tight spot then! I am the only one he hasn't seen. I'll go and see him. Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! - Everyone knows what they have to do? - Yes. - Atul! - Yes. And Tony... What's the matter, Amit? Why are you looking at me like that? Aren't you my brother? Who says so? Everybody says that you are not my brother Rohit. What does your heart say? That you are my brother. Even my heart says the same. Amit! Come on. Come fast. We have to go to the monitory room. That's a good boy. Let's go! Raj! And take care. Hey, Sonia! Your dad is here to meet you. My child! What's all this? You've come here long back but have been missing? Where were you all along and with whom? And what's all this about Rohit being back and his show? Daddy, he's not Rohit but Raj Chopra. - Raj Chopra? - Yes. He looks just like Rohit. I met him in New Zealand. He's helping us find Rohit's murderers. Rohit's murderers? Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Two policemen shot Rohit? What proof do you have? There is proof. Rohit's younger brother, Amit, has witnessed it. Sonia, the show is about to begin. - Come on. - Carry on. I'll join you. Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! - Malik, where are you? - In the stadium. Are you mad? I asked you not to come here! Don't worry. Even you will not be able to recognize me! Sonia has told me everything, but don't do anything foolish. He is not Rohit, but his look-alike Raj. Raj Chopra! Rohit! Rohit!

Thank you. It's only your love that has saved me from the jaws of death. This is a kind of miracle, an incredible incident. A dead man stands before you today. A man who was said to have died in an accident. But, friends, he did not die in an accident. He was murdered. Perhaps God kept me alive so that I could tell you the truth. So that I could show you those killers. And reveal their identities to you. So that they could get punished... both by God and the law. Their... Excuse me, sir, would you please switch off your mobile phone? And now... I'm going to reveal their names. There were three of them. Two of them were police inspectors. And their names are... Their names are... Hey, what happened? - Brother! - Raj! Malik, I'd told you not to do anything! Don't shout! You conspire with your daughter to have us trapped! Rohit hasn't seen you. It will be the three of us who will get trapped! Now, you watch my maneuver! Give the phone to Rohit! Raj! There's a call for Rohit! You've been very smart! Before revealing our names, hear this voice! Leave me! - Leave me! - Sonia! You heard her voice? Now, listen to me! There's a white car waiting outside. Its number is MH-O2-M-3818. Memorize the number. She is waiting. Come alone. Understood? What's the matter? They have kidnapped Sonia. - They've asked me to come alone. - Listen. What's wrong? Start the car, and do as I tell you. Turn right. Now enter the gate ahead of you. I'm here! Release Sonia! - No, Raj! Go away or... - Hey! Come here and take her away! Sir! He's not here! Rohit! If you don't show up before I count to three... you will see another dead body! One! Two! He won't heed this way! - Call him! - I won't! Call Rohit! You won't call him. Call him! Scream! Rohit, come out! Kadam, he won't come. Her death will beckon him here! Hit them, Raj. Hit them. Uncle? You! Yes, me. Misfortune and circumstances compelled me to do this. And you're seeing this facet of me. But, why do you want to kill us? Because, Rohit had seen us murder the commissioner. You'll be shocked now, when I tell you... the name of my fourth accomplice. Would you like to hear his name? Daddy! Brother! He is the same man who had called Sirjee. What's all this? So, you are Sirjee? Daddy, you! You also... Yes. I have committed a crime. And I hid it from you... and the world, as well. However, I could not hide it from Him! Nobody knows when He'll punish... in which form, and how. Please forgive me, dear. Raj! Where are you going, Raj? I'm taking Amit with me... and going back to my house. What about me? Won't you take me along? I have lost my love once. I don't want to lose it again. Say it.
