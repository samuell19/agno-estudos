What the hell, Bianca? You trashed my room. You lied to me. What are you talking about? You promised me we'd go away next weekend, and now you're going with Chad? He's my boyfriend, Bianca. You know what? I'm out of here. You're a complete psycho. Get outta my way. Sophie, I'm sorry. Please don't go. I, I, I'll, I'll replace the stuff in your room and it's fine if you wanna go away with Chad and, and we can, we can go away some other time. I am never, ever going anywhere with you ever again. Please, I'm sorry. I just get upset sometimes- - Stop! Stop using your dead sister as an excuse. It's old and tired, and frankly, if I had you as a sister, I'd slit my wrist, too. It's beyond me how you even function in the real world, let alone run a company. You should be locked up and in the- I told you. Don't ever talk about my sister. What are you doing with that? I'm taking it with me. Couples fight. Why are you turning this into such a big deal? It's all we do anymore. All right, Angelina, you already made your point. Let's just cut the drama. This isn't a joke. I'm done. I can't keep doing this. I can't keep living here. You can't be serious. I am. Where are you gonna go? Hm. That's none of your business. Shut up, Gaby! You're gonna let your friends run your life? Is that really what you want- if she let me run her life, then she would've left you a long time ago. Leave her alone. - Don't tell me what to do. - All right, all right. You can't stop her from leaving. Who the hell's this? I'm just here for their safety. You hired some meathead to come in here to protect you from your own boyfriend, huh? Are you sleeping with this loser? Step back, man. You think I'm gonna let you come into my house and tell me how to handle my business, huh? - Mm. - Get out! Let me make this clear. You're gonna let Angelina and Gaby finish what they're doing and then you're never going to contact Angelina again, you understand? Baby, come on. Just stop! I, it's you and me. It's always been you and me. Is that last one ready, Ange? Hey! I meant it when I said you were my angel, Angelina. Hey, let's go. Hey, no, come here. She deserves way better than you. She's mine, bro. Not yours. Don't think you could touch her. Okay? Bye. Hey. Thanks for all your help, and you know, for being 6'3". Not a problem. Hey, Gaby, is she gonna be okay? Yeah. I'll make sure of it. Good. Well, I will see you Monday at work. You girls needed anything at all, please call me. - Thanks. - Okay. It's done. It's done. It's gonna be hard for a while. I just, I don't wanna be weak again. Won't go back like I did last time. You're not weak. He's gonna try to convince you that you need him, but you don't. Don't even respond to his text. Thank you for always being there when I need you. It's a two-way street. Remember in high school when you let me copy your calculus homework for an entire semester? You saved me from having to take summer school. All right, it's been a rough day. Why don't you go take a bath and order a pizza. Extra pepperoni, right? Oh, that's right. You hate pepperoni. What was that? I think it's him. Better not be. There's no one there. He's insane. Out with the old and in with the new, right, Delilah? Okay. Go. You should take my bed tonight. You need a good night's sleep. I feel terrible about dragging into this. What if that brick came through the window? Then we would've filed a police report and there'd be someone here replacing the window right now. Okay, don't make light of it. This isn't fair to you. You always have a place here. I should get going. See you tonight? Yep. Do you ever think about hurting yourself? I just don't think that anyone would miss me. I would miss you. Dylan, look at me. I would miss you and I don't want you to die. Things change. Feelings change. The way you feel today won't be the way you feel next week or next month, so when you get those thoughts about hurting yourself, you have to remember that those thoughts and that situation, it's only temporary. I know it's hard to see it when you're in that dark place, but you have to trust that things will get better. That's actually really good advice. Thanks. I'm gonna write it down in my phone so I don't forget it. Hey, Gaby. Hey. Get out of here before I call the police, Marco. I just came to apologize, okay? Yesterday caught me off guard and I, I didn't react the way I normally would have. I found an anger management center and I'm gonna start taking classes. If you think I'm gonna convince her to take you back, you're crazy. Angelina's done. Move on. Stop throwing bricks at my door. No one understands what Ange and I have been through, okay? Not even you. Let me make this crystal clear. You show up here again, I'll file a restraining order. Watch the way you talk to me, hear me? You're not as untouchable as you think you are. Neither is she. Los Angeles native, graduated from L.A. Palms University, allergic to cats, and works as a suicide prevention counselor for disadvantaged youth, hmm. Best city Seattle, hmm. Hello? Hi, uh, Angelina? This is Bianca Hernandez. You emailed me about the room I posted. Oh yeah, hi. Thank you for calling me back so quickly. Well, it's been empty for a while now and I'd like to get it rented. Do you wanna come in and see it? Sure, um, I get off at 4:30. Does that work for you? That's perfect. I'll text you the address. Thanks. Uh, I'll see you this afternoon. Bye. You don't live here anymore, Delilah. Hello. Angelina, right? Yes. Hi, nice to meet you. Come on in. Wow. This is beautiful. Thank you. I have to admit it's not always quite this neat. No, I mean you have great style. I love the artwork. Thanks. My old roommate actually bought a lot of these pieces, but I don't think she's coming back for them or any of her stuff, it looks like. Really? Yeah. It's a long, boring story. Oh my gosh, I love Seattle. I was actually up there like a few months ago. It's my favorite city. I go all the time. Do you wanna see the pool? Yeah. I know it's not much, but you get used to it. Yeah, I bet I can probably adjust somehow. Let me show your room. It's obviously already pretty filled, but we can take out anything you don't wanna keep. No, no, this is amazing. I can't believe someone would just leave this place and all these beautiful things. I know. She was sweet, but she had her problems and she caused me a lot of grief. I hope she's happy, though. Come check out the rooftop. And this is where I do yoga and, I don't know, just clear my mind. It's great. Come on. Then I left San Francisco, wow, five years ago before I landed here. You still have family up there? Not anymore. Our grandmother raised us, but she passed a while back. Us? Me and my little sister. Oh my gosh, you're so lucky. I'm an only child. I always wanted a brother or sister. It's a bond like no other. Yeah, especially when your parents are constantly moving around like mine did. Oh my gosh. Are these yours? Uh, just some concepts I'm flushing out for a new line. You're a designer. Nothing crazy. I'm contracted with a few small retailers and mostly sell to boutiques. Your email said you are a suicide prevention counselor. Yeah. I work at the youth center in Lennox. That must be really rewarding. It is. It's also kind of hard. I don't only work with suicidal kids, but also all kinds of traumas. Like the death of a parent. Yeah, actually I just started working with this girl and she witnessed her father kill her mother. Really? Why'd he kill her? What'd she do? The mother? Nothing. I mean, she filed for a divorce and was leaving him is all. Well, at least the drive's not too far for you. Has anyone else applied for their room yet? I have a couple people scheduled to come see it later, but you're the first. But look, if you're ready to commit, I guess I could cancel and tell them I found somebody. Um, yeah. Great. As soon as you can get me the first month and deposit, I would be glad to give you the key. Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, I'll be here all day. I found a room to rent, but this has nothing to do with me not wanting to room with you. It's just that Marco knows where you live, and I just think it would be better if he didn't know where I was. I wasn't gonna say anything, but he stopped by this morning after you left. I'm so sorry. It's fine, I... Promise me you won't go back to him. I promise. I'm 100% done with psychos forever. Here. Hey! Let me help you. Thanks. I gave her those. They're so cute. Wow, this place is gorgeous. Thank you. Ange told me you were a fashion designer. Maybe I should have gone into fashion design. It's not for everyone, but to be honest, I don't really make enough to afford a place like this. I just inherited a bunch of money when my parents died. Mm, I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Well, that's it. Come here. Why do I feel like I'm dropping off my kid at camp or something? I'm gonna miss you so much. Let's go out for drinks next week. Yeah. Want me to help you unpack? Oh, you might wanna move your car first. They ticket a lot around here. It's fine. Just go. I'll text you later. Take care of my bestie, okay? Don't worry, I will. Okay, so where do you wanna go? I don't know, I was thinking that bar in. Need any help? Almost done. By the way, thank you for the bracelet. It's really pretty. Just a little welcome gift. I got one for me, too. You could have just borrowed mine. Oh, here you go. That's the key to the front door, mailbox, Wi-Fi, and the code for the security system. Oh, yeah, the security system. It's a really safe neighborhood, but I try to keep it on even when I'm here. Definitely, um, about that, I probably should have told you this yesterday, but the reason I need a new place is because I just moved from my boyfriend's house. Oh, I took it you were living with Gaby. Just for a few days. Um, the breakup was a little messy and he kept showing up at Gaby's place, so. I see. I just didn't want you to think that I was gonna bring a bunch of drama or anything. Not everyone handles it well when things end. What's this guy's name? Marco. Well, Marco's history. This is a new beginning for you and to celebrate, I think we should- - I'm sorry. This is my mom. Go ahead. Hey, Mom, no, it's not really a great time to talk. Because I wanted to let you know that I moved. I found this incredible place near the beach with an amazing roommate. No, uh, Marco and I are done for goo. What? You can't be serious. So what are you gonna do? I have to get it back. I have no choice. I just can't believe that he told my mom he wanted to propose. What was he thinking? And I can't believe that she would just give him my grandmother's ring. That's even crazier. Well, what's done is done. But now that you're broken up, I'm sure he'll give the ring back, right? You don't know Marco. That's the guy that threw a brick at Gaby's door at two in the morning. I can go get it if you want. No, this is my problem, not yours. Hey, we're roommates now. Your problems are my problems. That sounded weird. You know what I mean. Let me think about the best way to handle this, okay? Of course. Goodnight. Oh hey, come here a sec. What do you think? It's for my latest line. That's a beautiful jacket. You're really talented. Try it on. That looks so good on you. I'll say, I've never leather this soft. Well, how do you feel in it? I don't know, um, I feel stylish, confident, and definitely wealthy. I mean, how much does this sell for anyway? Oh, for you, gratis. Are you kidding? No, I have like 500 more I need to unload. So trust me, keep it, but let's mark the moment. Okay. Yes. Okay. Look how cute we are. Oh, and your hair is gorgeous. You think so? I was thinking about going back to my natural collar. No, you definitely don't wanna do that. You should wear it up more. Marco used to say that my hair looked better down. Mm, well, Marco's a loser. I love this pic. Okay, I'll tag us real quick. Oh, maybe you shouldn't just because I wouldn't want Marco to, you know. Of course. Right. Well, I'm gonna go take a shower and go to bed, but thank you so much for the jacket. I really love it. You're welcome, Angelina. Angelina. He sent me an angel. ♪ You are not forgotten ♪ ♪ Know I will always be here ♪ ♪ I will always be here ♪ Marco! Polo! Polo! Polo! Marco! Polo! Angelina. Hi. What's going on? You have my grandmother's ring and I, I need it back. Okay, yeah, yeah, um, how about we, uh, meet up for dinner and, uh, I can give it to you then. That's not a good idea. Can I just come and get it? Sure, yeah, whatever makes Angelina happy. Can you be here in an hour? Okay. I'll, I'll see then. Bye, gorgeous. What's wrong? I called Marco and he said I can come get the ring. Oh, well, that's great, right? Yeah, I still have his house keys so I can give that to him, he gives me the ring, and I never have to see him ever again. Great. It's just that even the thought of seeing him turns my stomach into knots. I'll go with you. No, I don't want you to do that. I don't mind. Besides, after everything you told me about him, I don't think you should be alone with him. Are you sure? 100%. Besides that's what sisters do, friends, I mean, that's what friends do. Thank you. That really means a lot. Baby, right on time. You look great, by the way. This is my friend, Nina. Nice to meet you, Nina. You're much prettier than the gun that she bought the last time. Please come in. Um, excuse the mess. I've been picking up a lot of night shifts lately, so I haven't had time to really clean, but loving the overtime, though. Just, um, I work is an ambulance driver for one of the biggest ambulatory services on the west coast, so. I'm sure you're pretty busy, so if you could just get the ring, we'll be out of your way. Okay, okay, would you like to sit down? The ring. You can have the ring if you say yes. You're my heart and soul, Angelina, my angel. Will you marry me? I, I, this isn't the way I envisioned it, but before you say anything, I want you to know it took you leaving me to understand what it was you were trying to tell me all along, that I didn't appreciate you the way you deserve to be treated, and I wanna spend the rest of my life making sure you know what a queen you are. Marco, no, just, I don't wanna marry you. So you don't love me. You, you said the kind of love that you have for me could never die. I know I said that, but, I just... I know, I know, I get it. I, I get it, I do. You're confused right now, but let me prove to you that I'm still all those things that you fell in love with. She said she doesn't wanna marry you. Just give her the ring. Whoa, mind your business, bitch. Marco. What, are you sleeping with that guy? You are, aren't you? What guy? The loser you brought over last time. I knew it. Okay, you're just acting a little crazy right now. Oh, oh, this is, no, no, this is what happens to guys when you smash their hearts to pieces. I never should have trusted you, Angelina! Last chance. Give her the ring or I'm calling the cops. Call 'em. Do it. The two of you will be dead by the time they get here. - We're going. - Yeah. Yeah, you think you can come into my house, huh, and threaten me. - My mistake. - You think you can? Did you know he had a gun? No! Go, go, go, go! What am I gonna do about the ring? It was the ring my grandpa gave my grandma at their wedding. Like, everyone in my family wanted it. Don't worry about that right now. All that matters is that you're away from him. I can't imagine what it was like living there. He wasn't like that in the beginning. He was actually really sweet and vulnerable. It's just, he grew up in such a toxic family, you know? I was the first person to show him what it was like to be loved. But if he never knew love, how was he going to know how to love you back? I came from a similar situation. My parents were awful to each other and to me and Amelia. Your sister. They abused her worse than me. To this day, I don't know why, but I knew I had to get us out of there. I convinced my grandmother to let us move in with her. Unfortunately, Amelia was never really able to put everything that had happened in the past behind her. What do you mean? She missed our mom and dad so much, these people who had hurt her, and I tried to take care of her and I tried so hard to make her feel loved. I thought that if we just stuck together, it would be enough, but, but she just went in and out of depression. It's okay. And then we got the call that my parents had been killed in a car accident, and when I heard that, I felt like, I felt like a burden had been lifted. I felt like we were finally free. And then that night I went with my grandmother to the store, and when we came back, Amelia had cut her wrists, and she had been waiting for us to leave so we wouldn't be there to stop her. Bianca, I'm so sorry. I just miss her so much. I tried to make her feel loved. It must have been so hard for you not understanding why you couldn't prevent it. I mean, if only I'd just done more. No, Bianca, it was nothing that you did or didn't do. I wish Amelia was still here. I wish I had my little sister. It honestly doesn't surprise me. He's gotten progressively psycho since you met him. You're right. I shouldn't have gone there. It was a bad idea. I'm just glad that Bianca was with me. I mean, who knows what could have happened if I'd gone alone. You should have taken Diego. I guess he told Marco that you deserved better. Oh my gosh, that's why Marco accused me of sleeping with him. You're kidding. No, Marco is so jealous of Diego. Diego? For good reason. Diego's smart, articulate, more attractive, and people actually enjoy his company. But I still need to get that ring back. My whole family's gonna hate me if I'm the reason it's gone. You? Your mom's the one that gave it to him. No, I always told her things were great, so it's not her fault. Contact a lawyer. There's gotta be a legal way to make him give you the ring back. Yeah maybe. You wanna go out for drinks tomorrow night. Yes. Drinks tomorrow night would be perfect. Not so fast, bitch! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't shoot that pretty little face. She just wants the ring pick. It belongs to her. Well, we don't always get what we want, huh? I want her to come back, but I don't think that's happening. I'll buy it from you. I have money. The ring is an heirloom, mm? It's not for sale. What if, um, what if I could convince Angelina to give you another chance? Who are you, anyway? I'm her therapist. I know everything about you and your relationship. I know you're not a bad person, Marco. It's not your fault that you had the childhood you did. Children that come from toxic homes are never taught how to express love, but I know you love her. Yeah. And you can learn to do that. And Angelina's great, but she's not perfect, either. I'd love to hear your side of the story. Maybe we can sit down, talk. Okay. And that's whenever I left my second foster home and moved back with my dad and his third wife. Yeah, that's the part Angelina can never understand. You know, she has great parents, and her mom adores me. Well, it sounds like her mother knows more about what's best for Angelina than Angelina does. Exactly. Tell me about Diego. Is she sleeping with him? No. Good. She never mentioned him in our sessions. She just said that he came with her and Gaby when they moved her things out. I guess he works with Gaby. You know, she's another one that tries to get an Angelina's head and break us up. Yeah, well, Gaby definitely has an unhealthy hold on Angelina. I know! - Mm. - I know. You're good. You know, I used to put much stock in therapists, but I feel you see what it's really like. Thanks. Yeah. Do you mind if I grab one of those? Yeah. Yeah, I'll get it. Uh, think I might be out of those, but I have, uh, water, um, orange juice, uh, some kombucha Angelina left. No! Oh, god. I'm sick of hearing about your childhood. Now tell me where the ring is, and I'll call you an ambulance. Hopefully they have somebody to drive it. Skull fractures can be serious, Marco. Please call. What's the passcode. 2008. Where's the ring? In my pocket. Give it to me. Oh god. Okay. Don't worry. Oh god. Your legacy will live on. No. No! Good morning. Hey, how'd you sleep? I dreamt about him. That's funny. I dreamt about him, too. Except in my dream, I'm the one that pulled a gun on him. No, no, no, it's great, actually, because I woke up this morning and I realized exactly what we need to do. You did? I'm sure you have photos of your grandma wearing that ring, right? My mom does, yeah. Well then, legally it doesn't belong to him, and under the state's replevin laws, he has to return it. You just have to file a court order. Really? How do you know all this? I spoke with an attorney friend of mine this morning and she's willing to do it pro bono. That is amazing. It could take a few weeks. It's fine, I mean, as long as I get it back. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. This is such a weight lifted. No problem. It's funny 'cause Gaby also told me to take the legal route. I guess I was the only one who didn't think of it. Well, we should go out tonight and celebrate. That would be terrific. Oh no, wait. I already have plans with Gaby. Break 'em. Or maybe we could go out the three of us. Are you down for that? Yeah, sure. Ms. Harrison. Hey, Dylan. How's it going? Come on in. Oh, it's cool. I'm actually headed to play some ball, but, um, I just wanted to let you know that I got accepted. To the school on the east coast? Yeah. Oh Dylan, that's amazing! I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Um, it's really like you said it. Strange how quickly things can change. Anyway, I'll catch you later. Sounds good. Hey, how was your day? Really great. Well, it's about to get a whole lot better. I have a little gift for you. I made it just for you. What do you think? You made this for me? I thought that maybe you could wear it when we go out tonight. Wow, I, I don't even know what to say. You like it, though, right? Of course. I mean, it's gorgeous. Well, I've been working on it all day, so I have to go shower and get ready. Okay, perfect. I'll see you later. What the? Hola, chica! Hey. Hi, it's so good to see you again. You, too. Bianca made this dress for me. Isn't it cute? Yeah. Did you make that one too? Yep. Oh, uh, excuse me, can I get a bottle of champagne and two glasses, please? Actually I'll have some, too. Okay, make that three. And then we had to walk three miles back to the hotel because you left her purse inside and they already locked the door. I don't know how we didn't get mugged or something. That trip was crazy. Oh, and do you remember the next day when we took the bus downtown? That was so stupid. Can y'all excuse me for a sec? I just need to use the restroom. Sure. Angelina? I'll say here. Okay, what's up with the matching dress? I think we're twinnies. Maybe she only knows how to design one thing. So aside from wanting to dress you from head to toe, how's it been? Pretty good. Convincing. Sometimes I feel like she's a bit too preoccupied with me. She stares a lot. Like at the wall? Yeah. Or at me. I don't know where her mind's at, but it's clearly somewhere else. It's like she wants to be my best friend even though we hardly know each other. That's weird. I'm probably overstating it. I mean, she's really great in many ways. She's having her friend file a court order for me against Marco. Speaking of Marco. What? "I poured my heart out and you stomped all over it. Girls like you deserve what they get." That's a threat. You need to show that to the cops. You're a bad boy, Marco. Yeah, but if the cops go talk to Marco, it's only gonna make him angrier. Well, what do you think a court order is gonna do? Hey. Diego's here? Uh, I, uh, invited him as a surprise. - Gaby! - What? He keeps asking about you. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I'll go get us another round. - Yeah, yeah. - Scotch neat, right? Yes, sure. Thanks. It's nice seeing you again. So how are you doing? Okay. I'm definitely in a better place than the last time you saw me. That's great to hear. Has he been leaving you alone? No, but he'll get the picture eventually. Yeah. Bianca, Bianca. ♪ Still all night till it's time to go ♪ What'd I miss? Oh, that's just my friend Diego from work. They have little thing for each other, so I'm giving them some space. What do you wanna drink? ♪ I don't care whatever people say ♪ Oh, hi. This is my new roommate, Bianca. Nice to meet you. Diego. Uh, so how are things at the community center going? Really great. Yeah? This kid I consult just got accepted into college. Oh boy, that's amazing. Yeah. It must feel good to know you're really making a difference. So what do you do, Diego? Oh, um, I work with Gaby at the ad agency. I'm a junior partner there. Oh, that's so cute, Junior. Thanks, Gaby. So Diego, tell Ange the good news. What is it? I just landed the biggest client our company has ever had. Congratulations! I wanna hear all about it. Um, so basically this has been a long time coming and, uh, yeah, Gaby knows all about it. She can tell you a little bit more. Maybe next time. No, but it's definitely, it's been about five, six months and today we finalized the deal and it looks like it's gonna be about seven figures, so. - Thank you. - Cheers. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank. This is me. Thank you so much for taking me out tonight. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Anytime, love. I'll see ya. Gaby, holy crap. I think someone keyed your car. What? It was him. It had to be. Marco? No, I mean, how would he even know we were here? I forgot to tell you, but he texted me tonight while you were in the bathroom. He might have followed Gaby. And I don't see any security cameras around here so there's like no proof that he was here. Look, I'm gonna go have a chat with this guy. No, I don't think that's a good idea. Me either. I'll just pay for the damage. No, he should do it. Okay, I think we should all go home, get some rest, and tomorrow, we'll be more clear-minded, okay? I can try to bring some rubbing compound over the weekend and see what I can do. Okay. Hey, drive safe. We'll figure it out. Okay. Bye. Bye. - You okay? - Yeah. Thank you. All right, well, it was great meeting you, Diego. Um, Ange, let's go. Can you just give me a second? Sure. So? Dinner next week. Yeah. I'll call you. Don't you need my number? You actually gave it to me already inside, remember? I believe it was right after your fifth glass of champagne. Yeah, I usually don't drink this much. It's all good. Well, goodnight, Angelina. Goodnight. Let me get this for you. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. Bye, Bianca. Drive safe. Nice meeting you. That was so much fun. Did you have fun? That was so fun. Yeah, it was a blast. What did you think about Diego? He's kind of amazing, isn't he? Uh, I don't know. There's something about him that doesn't feel genuine. Really? Yeah, I got a bad vibe from him. I didn't get that at all. Eh, well, after meeting Marco, maybe you're not so great at sensing that kind of thing. Well, Gaby likes him, so. Oh, well he'd be great for Gaby. She's got what guys like that go for. And what is that exactly? Don't get me wrong. I love Gaby. She's just kind of fake. Gaby is the most caring and honest person I know. We've been best friends since high school. No, she's super sweet and, and she's super fun to hang out with. It's just my impression of her. You obviously know her better than I do. Yeah I do. Think I'm gonna go to bed. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. That's fine. Goodnight. No, I, Gaby's really cool. I can see why you two get along so well. Amelia, don't go to bed angry, okay? Did you just call me Amelia? No, I called you Angelina. I'm not even gonna fight with you. You're drunk. Bianca?

I know her sister had some baby stuff and she could have- - Yeah, that's probably what happened. I don't believe her story about her roommate leaving the baby monitor. Especially if there was one in her room, too. This is just getting too weird. You can come back here. You're so sweet, but I just think maybe I should get my own place. Or maybe we can get a place together. My lease here is up next month. Oh, it's Diego. Pretend I'm not two feet away eavesdropping. Hello? You answered. Did you think I wouldn't? Well, you can be a little hard to read, especially when you're sober. So how does tonight sound? New place that open up in Playa del Rey that everyone is talking about. Do you like sushi? Love it. Perfect. May I pick you up at seven? Seven it is. I'll text you the address. Great. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. Me too. You're welcome. Okay. I'll get that. It's Diego. Oh, big date. I hope he's taking you someplace nice. Some new sushi place by the beach. Aw, got the roll? I heard it's really good. Enjoy your night. Have fun. What is Yuzu anyway? I think it's a cross between an orange and a lemon. Wow. Are you sure about that? No. Not at all. Hey, so if you and Gaby end up moving together, where do you think you'll go? I'd like to look somewhere in Santa Monica maybe. I've got an addicted to running at the beach after being at Bianca's. Yeah, Bianca's... Here. I'm so sorry to interrupt. I just, I couldn't wait to give you this. Are you serious? Did you get this back from him? Well, not me, my lawyer friend. I guess she went over to his house and he ended up giving it to her. That is incredible. Thank you so much. Of course. I know how much it meant to you to get it back. So do you think that we should call your mom to give her the good news? Oh, I can do that later. Oh, I just thought it would put her mind at ease to do it now. I'm pretty sure that she and my dad are out with their friends anyway, so. Oh! Oh, the sushi looks good. Yeah. Oh, is that yellowtail? Yeah, it is. It's my favorite. Mm. Well, I'm so sorry to bother you two. It's okay. I guess I'll just grab a burger on my way home. Thank you for bringing me this. Mm. Is it just me, or did she really want us to ask her to sit down? Maybe we should have. I mean, she did come all this way just to give me the ring. I'm sure she's gonna find a delicious burger somewhere else. That was really weird. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. To a great night. There you go, madame. Thank you. I had a really nice time tonight. So did I. Can I take you out again? Yes, but what if I take you out this time? Ooh. How about this? You can plan the date as long as you allow me to still pay. Careful. You don't know what I have in mind. Whatever it is, I can't wait. Goodnight, Angelina. Goodnight. Oh, hey. How'd it go? He's incredible. Thank you again for getting this back to me. I really appreciate it. So we're good now? Yeah, we're good. You guys should go salsa dancing. He said he used to teach it. Really? That's actually not a bad idea. Oh, by the way, I found a really nice two-bedroom in Malibu. It's small, but they've completely redone it. Malibu is kind of hard for my work, though. Why are you whispering? Who knows what else she planted in my room. I don't want her to know I'm leaving until it's time to leave. The sooner the better. It's fine if it's small, I just think we should find a place with two parking spots. Just send me the pics and I'll take a look. I will. Later, love. Bye. So are you a good dancer or am I gonna totally show you up? I'll have you know that I took eight years of ballet. You can actually do a spinny thing? Are you talking about a pirouette? Possibly. The one on the very tip of your toes. Those are called pointe shoes, and yes, it is as hard as it looks. Ouch. What's wrong. This is getting out of control. Your, your roommate. Hello, Bianca? Angelina. What's going on? He's here. Marco's here. What? He was banging on the door and I don't know where he went, but I think he might be trying to get in around back. Bianca, call the police. I did. They're on their way. Marco is at Bianca's house. What? Oh my god. I think I hear him downstairs. Get out of there. Bianca- Bianca. Bianca! He's inside. Let's go. But she already called the cops. All right, then. Marco better hope they get there before I do. Let's go. Marco's at Bianca's house. He's trying to break in. What? Where are you? I'm with Diego. We, we're going in right now. Why? No! Someone's gotta finish this crap with Marco for good. I have to go. We're here. Where are the cops? What's the alarm code? 22771. All right, stay here, okay? Okay. Bianca. Right behind you, sport. First Marco, and now you? She's my sister. You'll never compete with that. Bianca? Angelina? He's downstairs. Come on. Where is Diego? He's by the pool. Marco stabbed him. What? No, he'll kill us, too. God, where the hell are the cops? Give me your phone. Yeah, this is Bianca Hernandez. Where are the police? There's an intruder in my house, and he just stabbed a man. No, that's the wrong address. It's 829 Reese street, Reese. Hurry! It's okay. It's okay. I'll protect you. We're both gonna be okay. Okay. Oh my God. And when this is all over, we're gonna go far away from here. We're gonna start our lives over where no one can find us, okay. What? It's okay. It'll just be us together forever. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. I'll protect you. You never have to be scared ever again. We need to help Di- - No! Let him die. What? You don't need him. He doesn't love you. I'm the one who loves you. We're blood! What are you talking about? I can't Let you leave again. I can't let you leave me behind. I miss you too much! Get away from me. I'm not your sister, Bianca. I'm not Amelia. Well, we gotta get you out of here. It wasn't Marco. It was Bianca. Call the cops and go wait with Angelina. Where's Angelina? She's in my car. No, she's not. Why did you leave? We hated mom and dad, and yet you left to be with them instead of me? Get away from me. Don't you love me after everything I've done for you. Let me get out of here. No! Is that Marco's phone? Where did you? How did? He's gone, Angelina. He's at the bottom of the bay. He'll never bother you ever again. You mean? You! I didn't want to kill him, but it was the only way I could get the ring back. Oh my god. No! No! Go, go, go, go. Here. If we're gonna leave this world, we're gonna leave it together. You're my Angelina. Angelina! Stop! She doesn't like you, Gaby. I'm the one she wants to be with. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Go help Diego. I'll be fine. Go! Diego! Hello. Ma'am, police are almost there, and an ambulance has been dispatched to your location. Thank god. I've got you. Another one for the kitchen. You know, we should have done this a long time ago. Yeah. What are you doing here? I thought you had meetings today. I rescheduled. It's so good seeing you. Plus, you know I wanted to see your new neighborhood since I might be spending some extra time here. You just might be? Yeah. So can I help you? Yeah. You lead and I follow. How about that? Okay.
