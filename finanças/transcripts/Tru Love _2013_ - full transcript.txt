What was I supposed to do? You were supposed to meet with me! I was alone and upset. I mean this isn't the first time. Tru. We've been dating for months. We exchanged keys. We were falling in love. Yeah I thought I was. L. I don't know. I'm just. I'm not... You're not what? I'm not... ready... for a relationship. Yeah. And you never will be. And you know why? Because you don't give a damn about anyone or anything other then yourself. You should really come with a warning label. Tru. Y'know and if... if you didn't want to be with me. You could have at least had the courtesy to say it to my face instead of just hoping that I'd go away. Don't get up. I can kick myself out the door. Well it's just... it's beautiful. You're very quiet today. Am I? A little mysterious. No. I'm not. What's on your mind? There's nothing much to tell. Tell me something. Anything. I don't know much about you really. Well.

Who raised you? My Aunt and Uncle. Until I was fifteen. And what happened at fifteen? Well then l... Do you really wanna talk about this? Because... you know. Shitjust happens. Yes I do. I usually don't talk about it. Why? What happened at fifteen? Umm I got caught with a girl. And so what did they do? Umm... they locked me in my room for weeks. I broke the window with my hand and... I ran away. Where to? The streets. Shelters. A few nice people. I survived. You more than survived. You ever smoked pot. Alice? Once. A long time ago. It gets me in the mood. For what? Cooking. Cooking! So... So what is this? A double helix. A snake shedding it's skin. I was twenty-one. Wine? OK. You sure that you should be using a knife in your condition? I could do this in my sleep. Onions. I umm. I rub them in my eyes sometimes. Why? They help me cry. It's my therapy. I umm... I wasn't allowed to cry after the funeral. They gave me a few days and then... told me to "stop_'" To give my sumering over to Jesus. No. Yeah. And then... and then I just forgot how. Y'know people have always accuse me of not caring. That is not true. I care deeply... about onions. Tru. That's sad. That is so sad. Look. Look. Look at that cloud. Where? Look. Do you see it? No. It looks like a snake.

We went to Tru's house on the island. And we dined. And we played outside. We watched clouds... and we danced. It's almost midnight. Kinda late. I forgot about the time. Obviously. You missed dinner. We had plans. We did? I completely forgot. I'm so sorry. Darling. Will you forgive me? Are you drunk? No! No... no. I am intoxicated with life. I should go. I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. Suzanne. I didn't know you had dinner plans. Of course you didn't know. You have your father's temperament. Especially under stress and it is not an attractive quality. See you tomorrow? If Suzanne doesn't mind. Suzanne is not my mother. Tomorrow. Did you have to be so diMcult? Playing outside? Really Mother? And dancing? If I didn't know better I'd say you were attracted to her. If I didn't know better I'd say you're jealous. Ofwhat? I'm not sure. You tell me. Stubborn. Sarcastic. Impossible. You taught her well. That's right. Alice. It's all my fault. I've never had anything that wasn't mine. Anything that wasn't ruined. Ruined? You didn't need any of my help with that. God. You were such a heartless bastard. I thought that's what you wanted. I could have saved you a lot of trouble if I'd just dumped you at the door. God forbid that Alice should have any fun. That would be too embarrassing. God damn it Alice! You don't know when to stop. Now that wasn't necessary. Suzanne? You're home. Yeah. Um. Alice. ?s sick. I have to stay home and take care of her. Will she be alright? Yup. Hopefully. But she's too old to be playing outside. She caught a cold. You're mad at me. Is Alice really sick or is there something else going on here? I don't know what you mean. My Mother is sick. I have to go. Why are you being like this? Is it about the other thing because I thought we talked about that. OK. I can't talk right now I have to go. OK. I am leaving. Please just tell her that I came because she's expecting me. Thanks. Mother? Hello dear. Did you go out? No. Are you going out? I was expecting I was expecting Tru. But... I didn't... she didn't show up. so. Um. Well. We could go out. We could get dinner. I think um... I think maybe I'll just um... retire early. Goodnight darling. Goodnight. Hi. My mother still isn't well. I know. That's why I made her soup. What are you playing at? I don't know what you mean. My mother is easily influenced. She has been very fragile since my dad died. Someone's fragile. I saw you kiss her! In my hallway! That's what this is about? She kissed me... for your information. On the cheek. I know what you're like. What am I like? You know what will happen! No! I don't know! She can't see you. Did she tell you that? Give her this. Please. Mother fucker! DOORBELL KNOCKING Mother? Mom? Where have you been? Mother? I don't know... just... walking. I was worried about you. Sorry. I lost track of the time. OK. Well.

I was thinking that I could. Come home and help you. After this case is done. Well. That'd be nice. Where could it go? Well you could play house here. I Or better still house husband in North Bay. Brrr Y'know. I don't understand... why Tru hasn't come by. Tried to contact me. It just doesn't... It just doesn't make any sense. Have you heard from her? Y'know. L. um. I like Tru. But she is not that reliable. Really? And I found her quite the opposite. Well she has a reputation for it. For what? Tojust... to vanish? To disappear without saying a word? Yeah. But um don't. Don't take it personally. I just come to accept it about her. She called me a "mother fucker_'" Stop it! Well. She does have a point. I am not doing anything. Given your history with Suzanne. I'd say you're playing with fire and you are going to get burned. Burned! New shooters. On the house. Trying new flavors. That's exactly what you need. You're such a fool. That's love's job. Honey... to make idiots of us. Richard. This what it was like for you? Y'know I tried. I tried to love you. I did. I know you did. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. Alice! Alice? Alice! Wait. Alice. Alice? What's wrong? What's wrong? Everything's wrong. I waited two days for you. Two. Days. How could you do that to me? I did show up. l... The Pussy Whisperer. Alice? He-he-hey. Wai-wait. Stop! I feel so... stupid. I did come to see you. I tried! Look I'm freezing. Can we go inside? You have company. That's nothing. I just didn't. Didn't want to be alone last night. OK.

Alice. Wait. Wait, stop. Where are you going? Why didn't you come? I did come. I went to see you. Suzanne told me you were sick. I wasn't sick. Did you get my note? Why would she do that? I mean lie. To me! And to you. Alice... What? I thought that we had worked it out but I guess she's still upset with me. Upset. Upset about what? I think it would be better if she told you. Told me! What?! Y'know I'm so damn tired of being kept in the dark. It's highly overrated. It's complicated. Yeah well. Why don't you j ust uncom plicate it? Remember when I told you that "confused women like to sleep with me" too? Yes. One time... One time? When I stayed over at her place... Suzanne and you? We both had too much to drink... and... You and Suzanne... We woke up in bed together... and... that was... awkward. She couldn't talk about it and... that was the last time I stayed with her. How long ago? June. So shortly after Richard died. We bumped into each other awhile ago. She said she missed me. Wanted to reconnect. She seemed really happy about that. We had comee. And talked. Not about that. I thought we were OK. But... I'm sorry. L...I'm... I don't know what to say. We can still be friends though. Can't we. Alice? Friends? Yes. Of course. Friends. That's what we are. Sorry I doubted you. I thought you were tired of me. I could never tire of you. Really? Really. So was this our... our first fight? Our first misunderstanding. I stepped on it. The poor thing. It? Or me? Both. Darling. Hi Mother. Hi. Tru's cooking up a storm. Yeah. I see that. Cordon bleu. Will you join us? L have so much work to do. Y'know workwill always be here. I however. Will not.

That's better. Well I'm glad. This has been quite a trial for you. A trial? Yes. Funny. Mother. So are you. Are you seeing anyone? Wha-um... no. No secret lovers? Um more? Yeah Suzanne. Would you like... seconds? No. Well wasn't that lovely? She's so thoughtful and so kind. So you keep saying? Is um... ls there something that you want to tell me? Nope. Nothing? Nothing at all? OK. I don't know what she said to you. Suzanne come back here. Come back here and sit down. Sit. I went to her place. When she failed to show up here for two days straight without calling to cancel I knew something was wrong. I was worried. You saw that. You knew that she'd been here twice. Twice! She made me soup. She left a note. So... why would you lie to me? To protect you. To protect me? >From her. >From Tru? And why would rhar be? Am I on trial here? Yes in fact you are. Well- Why! You were sick. ?s that the real reason? You were vulnerable. Is that the real reason? What are you suggesting?! I'm suggesting that there might be another reason for your blatant display of insecurity. You slept together. Something transpired. I have no idea what. You have feelings. Unresolved feelings. Good or bad which is it? WHICH IS IT? Mother. Wow. SOFT KNOCK ON THE DOOR Suzanne? Are you OK? I'm sorry I upset you. I know we seem to be doing a lot of that to each other lately. Can we talk tomorrow? Of course. Yes of course. Tomorrow. Now that this is all. You know. Out in the open. Goodnight darling. Goodnight. Hi. Hi. You told my mother we slept together. We did sleep together. Yes. I know that. But why did you tell her? She wanted to know what was going on. It's none of her business. Well you made it her business by lying to her. It's my privacy. My decision. It's mine too. I can see where this is going. Where? You're trying to control this conversation just like you do everything. That's why you came here. No. I came here because I wanted to meet you as far away from my mother as possible. She is vulnerable just like I was. You crawled into bed with me Suzanne. Stay the fuck away from my mother. DOORBELL Ye-? Tru? Why. I'm not quite made up. I wasn't expecting you for hours. I'm sorry. No. No. No need. I'm happy to see you. Come on in. You can relax. She's not here. So. Why don't you have a seat and I'll finish getting ready. I won't be a moment. Alice. l... I need to talk to you. OK? Sounds serious? It's about Suzanne. Well. What about her? Mother. Suzanne. You alright? You look um... I look umm. What? What have you Been up to today? I've had a very interesting day. So far. I had a visitor. How dare you banish her from seeing me. Who do you thinkyou are? Your daughter. Or have you forgotten? It is none of your business. It is my business. You are my mother. Start acting like it. It is my life and I will do as I damn well please. And I'll do what's necessary. Well maybe I should leave. Maybe you should. Why are you so stuck on seeing her? I like her. I like spending time with her and that should be enough. Yeah. I know you do. More than you like spending time with me. You are being childish. Why should you care? You don't have any time for me. You've never had any time for me. Who are you reallyjealous of?! I'm not gay. ?f that's what you're suggesting. Me thinks the lady doth protest too m uch. It was once and nothing came of it. That does not make me gay. No. But it does make you frightened. Y'know... maybe Tru's right. Maybe you are simply confused. Tru? Tru. ?s that all you can talk about? It's sick. You're obsessed. Leave me be. At your age it's pathetic. Get out! What about dad? Have you forgotten about him already? Maybe Claire and Suzanne are right about me. About what? I'm a hazard. Should come with a warning label. You should. A big ass caution sign. Seriously Gray. You've known me longer than anybody else. What is wrong with me? Nothing but hurt. Old hurt. You're running. Baby girl. We both are. Run. Run. Run. I'm tired of running. She's as much you as she is me. Alice. Your beauty. Your temper. Your passion. My bloody arrogance. I'm sorry if l... put you in a box. Maybe I was afraid if I opened it. Even a little. You would leave me. Can I come in? Yes. I'm sorry I said those things. I'm sorry too. I said some terrible things to you. I didn't mean them. Y'know it's true. You should be apologizing to me. You were very cruel to me. Whatever went on between the two of you Suzanne... or not, let it go. It's over. Wait until you're my age to start torturing yourself. Please. Sort. Sort this thing out with her. This mess. This confusion. For your sake and for no other reason. I don't understand any of it. I know. But maybe one day you will. Suzanne. If only you could see. Life slips away so quickly. It's over in the blink of an eye. And most people are too asleep to even notice. Hey. Sorry. Um. I mean... I'm sorry. Is that it? No. Um. You were right. I was avoiding you. I was... waiting for you tojust... 90 aWay. Because I'm a... I'm a coward. I mean. I fucked up Claire and I am fucked up. Just want you to know that I know that now. Good for you. Hey look. I don't expect you to forgive me... because I don't... forgive me. I just...

She was fine. No. She wasn't. She had an aneurysm. It was sudden. She died on the train. She never even made it home. She was so sick. How did I not know that? Did you know. Tru? Did she say anything to you? No. I don't. I don't know what to do. I um... the The funeral is on Saturday. Can you come. Tru? Can you um. Can you come? Tru wait! Stop. I'm glad you came. I was such a bitch to her in the end. I feel really terrible about that. You have to try and forgive yourself. She would want that. Besides you were just being yourself. You should go. Take care ofyourself. OK? I mean that. You too. Hello Tru-licious. It's j ust me calling to L love you. And I miss you and I'm j ust a ferry trip away. Honey. You're gonna be OK. Call me when you come up for air. Big kiss. Bye. Hey Tru! Hi Scott. Hey! You look like you had a nice vacation. Yah. Shoulda gone to the Arctic then coming back to this would have been easy. So we found this letter in our mailbox and Mary-Anne figured it must be yours. Gertrude? Don't tell anyone. No no. Your secret is safe with me. Say hi to Mary-Anne for me. Dearest Tru. You have stolen my heart. Paris in the spring? Ready? Yeah.
