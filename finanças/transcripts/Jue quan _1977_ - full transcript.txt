ZHENG YI MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL PRODUCER: SUSANNA KUO JUE QUAN (THE 7 GRANDMASTERS) PLANNING: JIANG NAN, MANAGER: LAM MAN-WO Congratulations. This way, please. ASSISTANT DIRECTORS: TU PO-HANG, WA SIU-KONG MANAGEMENT: CHEN MINGQUAN CINEMATOGRAPHER: JAMES WU KUO-REN Thank you very much for coming. Congratulations. Yong Zhang, raise the banner from His Majesty. Yes! YI ZHU QING TIAN (HE WHO HOLDS UP THE HEAVENS) Our thanks to His Majesty. Yong Zhang, hang the banner. Yes, sir. Second brother! Come. What's going on? Master. Master. Here, Master. Easier to secure a title than prove yourself to be the greatest fighter. There is doubt to who the Champion of Jiangnan really is. Stop the ceremony! Why? Father, what's the matter? - What's happening? - I don't understand. I've been established in these lands for over 30 years. Ancl I've always been highly respected by my peers. I've successfully driven out local bandits and Japanese invaders. As this honour was bestowed by His Majesty, it gives me both excitement and fear. You are a righteous warrior and the most skilled fighter. Everyone praises you, even His Majesty. You truly deserve the honour. 30 years in this practise has made me tired. I had planned to retire after today's ceremony. But I didn't expect... You have so much fame. How can you give it up? You flatter me, sir. Either way, I must reverse my decision. I have changed my mind, not because I wish for more fame or fortune. But just now, I've received a warning by carrier pigeon by those who disapprove that I am the Champion of Jiangnan. Ancl that this banner is nothing but pure exaggeration. To protect my reputation, I must change my decision. In order not to deviate from His Majesty's wishes for me, this ceremony and my retirement will be postponed. After I've met the provincial champions Tiger, Panther, Dragon, Snake and Eagle, I shall retire. You're out to prove that you're the Champion of Jiangnan? There are those who disapprove of my claim. You suspect that includes me? I only ask the provincial champions to prove this matter. Fame can hurt a man. Fame can also bring a lot to a man's life. Mr Sha, I must do this to keep my title safe from insults. Then I'll fulfill your wish! You have my thanks. ZHEN TIAN MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL Father. This was something you had to see to believe. The Bai Mei (White Eyebrow) fist is very fierce. Even with the Invincible Armour technique, you'd still be dead. You! So Shangguan Zheng is the killer. FUJIAN PROVINCE: SHA ZHENTIAN Father, what are you thinking about? Nothing. We're in Zhejiang province now. The duel with Yang Jun will be tomorrow. Are you Yang Jun, the Zhejiang champion? Yes, I am. Do you know why I made an appointment with you? Are you confident enough to beat me? First strike! Second strike! Perching Swallow! Third strike! Bai Mei fist is incredible. My admirations. Mr Yang, your exceptional skills are worthy of your name. Thank you. Let's go. Sir, were you watching the whole time? Just like you, I was watching to widen my horizons. Is he really the Champion of Jiangnan? The seven provinicial champions could never beat him. Shangguan Zheng will do very well. An old fart like you wants to be champion? I'd like to see how good you really are. What? You doubt me? Just watch and I'll give you a good show. This technique is called "Monkey Climbing a Tree". Don't play your monkey games with me. Iron Monkey Head. Monkey Liu, is there anything else you'd like to show me? No more. His experience makes all the difference in a fight. How did he win? That strange strike he used. It makes him the best kung fu fighter? It may be the strongest strike of the Bai Mei style. How do you know he used the Bai Mei strike? Everyone knows Shangguan Zheng is a master of Bai Mei style. Shangguan Zheng's kung fu is unmatched in the world. If you desire to learn kung fu, he's the best master. Am I worthy? You should have more confidence. Who are you? Me? I'm just a man who knows many things. Young man, you should try and see. If he refuses you, come and find me at Han Shan Temple. I'll introduce you to another top fighter. Another top fighter? Hey, good sir! You want to cross the river? Yes! Can your boat really support the five of us? You're right, it'd be a dangerous trip with you. You better swim across yourself. What? Me swim across? Xiao Qi. Master. You're causing trouble again. Yes, I... I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry. I was just joking, come on. Thank you! Wait! Excuse me, sir! I'm Shao Niu. Who? I'm Shao Niu. What's the meaning of this? Your kung fu is incredible. I'd like to become your student and serve you for the rest of my life. You ask me to be your master. But I'm not accepting students. I'll be loyal to you, as long as you take me. I'm ready to face any hardship. Please let me be your student. I cannot. - Get on board! - Yes. Sir, please listen to me! Sir! Go away! Kid, a man shouldn't easily kneel before another man. Don't you know? Sir! Shao Ying! Shao Ying, you can't go! Shao Ying, don't go! Get on board! Yes! Don't hold me back! Shao Ying! I don't care! I want to be a great man. If you can't wait for me, go marry someone else! I beg you, Shao Ying. Shao Ying! - Sir! - Shao Ying! Master, look. He's swimming towards us. Shao Ying, you can't go! Father. Wait for me, sir! Please wait for me, sir! The sun is really burning. Father, have some water. You... It's nothing, really. Please don't mind me. But... I'm just drying my clothes. Sir, you've said the sun was burning you. I wouldn't want to lose my master. Sir! Pal, don't you find your behaviour disgusting? Disgusting? I'm just fulfilling a student's obligation. Shut up! He isn't your master! Master! Wait for me! Master! You're just like a worm! Master, have this chicken leg. Father, are we going to stay here tonight? Eat up and then get some sleep. The fourth duel will be tomorrow. It smells good but you have no wine to enjoy it with. Master, it's still warm. Please have some wine. No, thank you. Evening, miss. How do you do, brothers? I think you all must be feeling cold. Have a drink to warm up. Have some chicken. Here, sister. You want the head? Thanks. Chicken head is good for the brain. You want a drink? Leave me alone! Here How does it taste? It's chicken butt, isn't it? A tasteful chicken butt. I'd be a fool not to try it. YOu! You don't know anything! Go away! Brother? I'm not your brother! Go away, go awaY! I know Master will surely win! Of course! Look, even master's stance looks superior. Shut up! He's not your master! Mr Xuan, let us fight but without excessive force. Alright? Yes, a display of skills. May the best person win. Yes, please do! And you! Mr Xuan, please forgive me. I lost honorably. Thank you for showing mercy. That's not necessary, go away! Wait for me! Wait! Excuse me, clerk. Sir. Sir, would you like to stay for the night? Do you have any first-class rooms? Yes, we do, upstairs, a clean and big room. Then show us this room. Yes, of course. Waiter. Waiter. Waiter, bring me some wine. Wine? Yes, sir! Here you go, sir. Please. Any herbal remedies that we can try? Not yet. The journey has exhausted father. Now he's sick with a terrible cold. We'll take turns taking care of master. I'll find him a doctor tomorrow morning. Coming! The doctor is here! The doctor is here! The doctor is here! Doctor, wake up. Doctor, wake up! Wake up! Cure the master and you'll be rewarded handsomely. I'll go open the door. Doctor. What's going on? I've brought a doctor to see master. He's not your master. Who asked you to get a doctor? This is none of your business. Go away and take him with you. He's the one who forced me to come. Brother, the doctor's already here. Why not... just let him... Please take your time and cure our master. Yes. Is this medicine for master? Yes, the doctor said to boil three bowls down to one bowl. Let me have a look. Give it to me, now! Alright but just a look. This is not your business. What are you doing? I boiled this medicine. Fine, since you boiled it, take it back if you can. Do you want to try again? Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! You want it? Alright, come and get it! Right, I'll take it! My medicine! Come on, why don't you take it? Alright, I give up! You take it to master. You give up? Then I'm taking it to master. What are you doing? Nothing, just be careful with the medicine. Please. Father. Master! Father. Master! There's no bridge or boat, how will we cross over? We must think of something. I have an idea. Let's carry master over on our backs. No more nonsense! But... Go away! We can't risk getting the master wet. I know! Sister, you stay here with master. You two, come with me. Yes! Father, have a rest. Sister, master is still sick. He mustn't get wet. Yes. You should let master rest longer. Hurry! Let me help you! Go away! Sister, bring master over there. Let's go, move. Father, let's go. Bring master here, sister! Alright Sister, wait... Sister, wait... Sister, I'm stronger. Let me carry master. Alright. Be careful. Yes. Father! Father! Master! Master! Father! Father! Master! Father! Brother, hurry! Master! Master. Father! Master! Father. Master! Father! Father! Master! Father, are you alright? Are you alright? Father! Master! Master, I didn't mean it. Brother, it was a mistake! Brother. You've really clone it now! You've really clone it now! You fool, are you just going to stand here all night? You're a fool but you have guts. Thank you for forgiving me, master! QING LONG (GREEN DRAGON) TOWN What is the situation? Master, Sun Hong is expecting you at noon tomorrow. Good, well clone. Sit down and let's eat. Yes. So your father still won't accept me as his student? I've mentioned it to him today. But he still refused. I think you should just give it up. No, I must persist. He has three students. What's one more? That's different. Father understands them very well. He knows their backgrounds also. That's easy. He'll learn more about me in time. I believe your father will change his mind. Father. He's right, I do have three students. Will one more hurt? Father, have you changed your mind? Ming Zhu, I'm afraid of making a mistake of taking in a bad student. It's a lesson I'll never forget from my master 30 years ago. Shangguan Zheng! Come with me. Yes, sir. Master! BOOK: 12 STRIKES OF BAI MEI Shangguan Zheng, you must keep it safe. If there be no suitable student to pass it on to, you may simply destroy it. So that... So that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Master, your illness. It's hopeless now. I was poisoned by a wicked person and this is the end for me. Master, who did this to you? - You mustn't blame him. - I must avenge you, master! It's my fault. Remember. The 12 Strikes of Bai Mei are all connected. Master! Master! Master! Master, rest assured. I'll keep the manual safe. So my master was killed by his own dishonorable student. Father, so who is this murderer? Who has taken the last three strikes of Bai Mei? If I'm right, it was he who did it. Father, who are you talking about? Your junior martial uncle, Gu Yifeng. Oh? For more than 30 years, I've been investigating this matter. Ancl I've been searching for those three strikes of Bai Mei. Therefore, I cannot accept any more students. I understand why you're so worried now, father. But Shao Niu is very sincere. Father, could you... That's enough for now. Let's talk no more about this. It's late now. You should go to sleep. Father. Go to bed. Who is it? Your tea. Come in! Yes. Your tea. Master, are you alright? Father, are you alright? Who told you to come here? Talk! It... it was Sun Hong! Stop! They had nothing to do with this. Let them go. Let's Master! Master, are you alright? Sun Hong, you dare send men to kill me? That was too despicable! I just wanted to protect my title as Hubei Champion. To save your title, you risked your good name. Farewell. Shao Niu. Thank you. Thank you, senior brother. Thank you, senior brother. Next is Hunan and then Guangxi. I will fight them, win or lose. Sir... No, master, you'll surely win! We'll rest and stay here for the night. Xiao Qi, let me ask you a question. Why was Sun Hong defeated? Because you were superior. Speak more in detail. We are reviewing a lesson. What was his vital weakness? I know! Oh? You know? Well, I have a guess, anyway. If you're correct, I shall accept you as my student. Sun Hong is diverse in all types of kung fu. But he doesn't specialize in one specific style. Yes, weapons have their advantages and disadvantages. A wise man will choose the one most suitable for him. And then specialize in that weapon. One is unable to digest all of them in one lifetime. Thank you for your lesson. Come here. You really wish to learn from me? I'm committed and ready with all my heart. Now tell me your full name. I'm Sha Shaoying. Sha Shaoying? Who gave you that silly name? I, well... How old are you? Where are you from? What other relatives do you have? I'm 21, my home is Nan yang. My parents cited when I was young. I'm... all alone now. After seeing your performance lately, I shall accept you as my student. Thank you, master! Wait. You can be my student, but I have three conditions. Say 30 and I'll still agree to all of them. First, you shall not easily fight with others. Yes. Second, always keep courtesy and righteousness foremost in your mind. Yes. Third, unless it's unavoidable, you shall not kill. You refuse to follow the third condition? Yes, I promise you. Please stand. Greet your brothers and your sister. Sister. Brothers, please teach me well. Take this, you're the youngest. You carry everything! Hurry UP! You thought it was going to be so easy. Get a hold of yourself! Yes. Go! Our next destination is Hunan. We've got 10 more clays before we get there. Master wants us to practise hard. To welcome our new brother, I'll teach him a new strike today. Brother, you'll teach me? That's right. You attack me first. Remember, this is called "Rolling the Lazy Mule". Senior brother, no need to be so harsh. Let me teach him, alright? Sure, please. Get up now. Don't you want to learn kung fu? Come on, hit me! Again? Remember, this is called "Four Legs Facing the Sky". Little brother, they're just playing with you. Better that I teach you. That technique is called "The Laying Body". I won't give you a lesson. All I'll tell you is to always stand up when you fall. Did you hear that? Always get up when you're down! Practise hard. Follow! Yes! Brother, my foot! Your footwork is terrible, try again! Again! Your fists lack strength! Your hands and feet are no good! THE CHAMPION OF HUNAN PROVINCE Shi Jun, you are truly a Seven Star Praying Mantis Fist Master. So, this is all that Shangguan Zheng can do? Don't get too confident yet. How was that? The way of kung fu, no one is invincible. A fighter shouldn't be arrogant and bully others. After meeting Zhao Long, I'll finally end this life of wandering. Master. I shall retire soon. Master, where is Zhao Long? In the Dragon and Tiger House of Guangxi. Father, we still have 450 miles to go. The roads are rough and you're not feeling well. I think we should cancel the journey. The last step is often the hardest to take. I'm not a person who'll abandon the job halfway. Father, is this challenge so important? Yes, it's extremely important. Zhao Long is a martial artist like no other. Ancl he's champion of all the southern provinces. If I don't challenge him, then this journey has been wasted. Father! Speak no more of this. You each practise sparring with Shao Ying. See what he has learnt. Yes. That's enough. Third brother, why don't you spar with Shao Ying? Teach me well, third brother. Yes, watch out now. Third brother, are you alright? Let me try! Sister, you should have a try. Sister, I can't. Come on! Get up! Forget that she's a girl Use everything you got! Idiot, what are you afraid of? What happens if your opponent is really a girl? But she's not a... Sister! Sister, if he's not willing to fight you, then let me! I'll surely beat you within half a year! Execute the Turning Wheel. Antelope Leaving the Cave. Cicada Shedding its Skin. Dragon's Tail. Tiger Capturing the Dragon. Buddha Standing on His Hands. The Perching Swallow. The Downstream Current. He's sleeping. Let's go have some fun. Good, let's go. Hey kid, you can fight back a little now. A mouse can sometimes beat the cat. Alright, now I'm going to put the mouse back in his place. My leg powerful enough? How about my fists now? This is "Lying Body" technique. Well, your fist really is powerful! Let me tell you, this is "Four Legs Facing the Sky". Senior brother, be careful now! Senior brother, this is the "Rolling the Lazy Mule" technique. This... Your fists lack strength, hands and feet are no good! How could you be good material for learning kung fu? I've heard you defeated the champions from all the provinces. Congratulations to you. It's too early to say. I haven't dueled with you yet, Mr Zhao. I won't fight you. Why not? Your face looks pale and you lack strength. It's obvious that you are sick. But I must challenge you! If you insist, I do have an idea. What is it? Let's use an alternate method. We'll each appoint three students as our representatives. Three fights to determine the winner. Good, we'll do it your way. I'll send out my student first. Nan Fei. Sir! Tang Min! Yes! Mr Shangguan, seems you've lost this round. Yong Zhang, you're up! Yes! Let me try! Nan Lin, go! Sir! Well, you want to try to kill me? Small head, what's wrong? Don't like it? Once we fight, it'll be your turn to lose. Small head, don't embarrass your master now. Take a hike! Don't look down on me. Hey, how about this? All three of you attack me together. Maybe that'|| be more fair. You're a crazy kid! I'm going to have fun beating you myself! Good, try it then! I thought you said you could do this yourself? Get him! What, you can't wait? Well, you better all attack at once! You should have clone this in the first place! Get him! [)0 you give up? Yes! And you? [)0 you give up? Yes, I give UP! Stop now! Great students stem from great masters. Mr Shangguan, you're truly the champion now. My admirations. You flatter me, Mr Zhao, my student was lucky. Father, we won! Yes, it's all because of Shao Ying. It's been a hard journey of two long years. Ancl after seven successive victories, my wish has been realised. Ming Zhu, what are you thinking about? Nothing really. Father, I just want to go home. Go home? Yes, let's go home. GUANGZHOU CITY I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - Watch where you're going! ZHENG YI MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL In my 30 years in the martial arts world, I've been a man of righteousness and benevolence. I never used force to oppress the weak. That is why His Majesty has bestowed me this honour. YI ZHU QING TIAN (HE WHO HOLDS UP THE HEAVENS) I now invite you to be my witnesses. For the next fortnight, I'm ready to accept any challenge. After, should there be no change, I will retire with the title of Champion of Jiangnan. Retire? Who'll be in charge then? Please keep quiet. I, Shangguan Zheng, may be retired, but Zheng Yi School will carry on. Let me introduce you to a brilliant student who joined us during our great journey. He is Sha Shaoying. Go! Go, go! Go! I... Uncle Liu! Uncle Liu! Uncle Liu! Please tell me, who killed my father? Who? I can't tell you. Why not? The clay when you've achieved great kung fu skills. I shall tell you then! Who killed my father?! Uncle Liu! Uncle Liu. I, Shaohu, have returned. And I've achieved great kung fu. Good, that's marvelous! I want to know the man who killed my father. Please tell me! I fear that you won't be able to defeat him. I'm not afraid of death! Who is he? The master of Zheng Yi School, Shangguan Zheng! Shangguan Zheng? Yes, it was him! I saw your father die at his hands! I didn't expect you to remember and find me. You told me to find you if I wanted to be the most invincible. Me? But I have no kung fu to teach you. I must defeat a man. And bring justice to my father! What did you say? My father had a duel with Shangguan Zheng. It was supposed to be a friendly match. But he killed my father. If you want to defeat Shangguan Zheng, it won't be easy. Only one man could possibly defeat him. Please tell me, sir Alright, I will introduce you to him. Thank you, sir! SHAO YING IS A STUDENT OF MANY TALENTS AND A MARTIAL ARTS PRODIGY PLEASE ACCEPT HIM FOR TRAINING What have you learnt from Shangguan Zheng? The Nine Strikes of Bai Mei The Nine Strikes of Bai Mei? Shangguan Zheng is champion clue to those nine strikes. Alright, you shall show them to me. Although the Nine Strikes of Bai Mei are all very powerful. But they can't defeat my Three Strikes of Bai Mei. Three Strikes of Bai Mei? That's right. No one else can teach you them but me. Please teach me, sir! Master. Master. Congratulations! "He Who Holds Up the Heavens". The Champion of Jiangnan. Tomorrow. No, today after the ceremony, I shall announce my retirement. That means the title of Champion of Jiangnan will no longer exist. Master! Master! Master, something's happened. What is it? Shao Ying is coming here under the flag of Zheng Tian School. Master. Shao Ying, you worked so hard to be my student and learnt kung fu from me, just for this clay? Please forgive me, master. I heard you want to fight me in the name of justice. Explain yourself! My name is Sha Shaohu. My father, Sha Zhentian, had a friendly duel with you. You said you only wished to compare your kung fu with his. However, you killed him instead! I didn't kill him! Young Master, he did, I'm sure of it. I saw it with my own eyes! I've sworn to avenge my father's death and bring justice! Have you forgotten?! Who taught you kung fu?! I didn't know you're the one who killed my father. I'm sorry. You fool, I just told you. I didn't kill your father! Why don't you believe me? When I left your father after our duel on that clay, I heard him cry out. There was a masked man who killed your father. I struck his ribs instantly. However, he ran off. That's all that happened. I don't believe you! Shao Ying, you ungrateful traitor! You don't deserve to be a student of Zheng Yi School! We'll take care of that later! I must take revenge for my father right now! But you've got the wrong man. I've also been looking for that assassin. Shangguan Zheng, don't deny it. Master Sha died in front of you, with his face covered in blood. I saw it myself! I must take revenge for my father. Ancl I can't let the one who murdered him go. Shao Ying, do you really want to fight me? I have no other choice. Fine, I'll do as you wish. Master, let me take care of him. Yong Zhang, stand back. Master, prepare yourself. Eagle Captures the Chicken! Who taught you that strike?! Mantis Turns its Body! Father! Father. Master. Don't come any closer! Master! Master! Who taught you this? Sir! You useless fool! You're wasting my time! Why don't you kill him?! It's you. Are you Gu Yifeng? The scar across your ribs. You killed Sha Zhentian! That's right! I am Gu Yifeng. I am also Shang Puyun of Han Shan Temple. And the one who killed Sha Zhentian was me! It was you?! 20 years ago, our master entrusted him the 12 Strikes of Bai Mei. I was not chosen to be his successor. I then stole the last three strikes and ran away. I took Shangguan Zheng's retirement as an opportunity. Ancl I killed Sha Zhentian and put the blame on Shangguan. Then, I convinced you to learn under him, so in the end, you'd both end up killing each other. So this was your plot from the very beginning. Of course! But this fool won't kill you. Now, I have to do it myself! Master! Remember, all the Bai Mei strikes are connected. Shao Ying, listen to me. Tiger Capturing the Dragon! Cicada Shedding its Skin! Dragon's Tail! Buddha Standing on His Hands! Walking on Air! Master! Master! Father!
