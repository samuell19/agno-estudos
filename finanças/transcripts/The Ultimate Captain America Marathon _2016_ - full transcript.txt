Time, 6 o'clock, 36 degrees. First light in Boston. I'm Joe Mathieu, WBZ News. Good morning. Just hours away from the starting gun. It was first run in 1897. Today the nation's oldest marathon will be run for the 117th time. Some 27,000 runners from all over the world are expected to run Boston this year. WBZ AccuWeather. Temperatures will climb into the 50's this afternoon. We are only moments away now from the starting gun for the men's race in the 117th Boston Marathon, live at the starting line in Hopkinton. 30 seconds to go. This will be the last announcement before the start. Have a great race, everybody. And already thousands of runners right behind these elite runners. Weather conditions are excellent. Mid 40's right now, just a light breeze. Ideal conditions for some very fast times. We are about to get this race underway. They are lined up at the start. And there they go. A good, clean start. Wesley Korir leading the early pack down the streets of Hopkinton. Thousands of runners coming behind them. And the 117th running of the Boston Marathon is headed to Boston. The Boston Marathon is an annual Patriot's Day tradition. The holiday commemorates the anniversaries of the battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battle of the Revolutionary War. There was a reason why I'd never been to the marathon. I hate crowds. So when my sister first told me that she was going to run, my first thought was, shit, now we've got to go. Alarm goes off. I don't even know what time it was. It was early, early, early. They're blocking off streets. We got to make sure we're in town on time. We didn't really run into a ton of traffic. With just the morning sun, it was beautiful. They'll run the historic 26.2 mile course that begins in rural Hopkinton, Massachusetts and ends in downtown Boston. All streets around Copley Square are shut down already for the marathon. Boylston closed between Exeter and Arlington. Honestly just partying on Boylston Street. Going down, having a fun day. Sometimes I went to the Red Sox game, then I'd go down. First pitch 11:05 this morning. The parking around Kenmore Square will be severely limited due to the marathon. My brother, Paul, was talking about going to the marathon, and we were going to watch one of our best friends run. Boston, we're notoriously provincial, parochial. But marathon day, today when Boston is most welcoming to the outside world. As a kid, that was the event of the year. I grew up in Cambridge and there were some times we couldn't attend the marathon. We'd listen to it on the radio. It's like, what is more boring than listening to a marathon on the radio? The women are coming down the stretch. The leading runner on the women's side. We had both run it in 2005, but Jess had never really been there to spectate and see what a massive party it is. We didn't really have a plan that day. We just, we were going to see where the day took us. Runners have to post a qualifying time for their age and gender to get into the Boston Marathon, but usually around 5,000 participate by pledging to raise money for charity. You pass a sea of humanity. Thousands of people screaming. Strangers, kissing strangers. It just binds people across 26 miles. They will literally bring you across the finish line. And that is the heart of the Boston Marathon. For the men's elite, Lesilsa Desisa of Ethiopia, just 24 years old. Three men finish coming down here. Pretty amazing, given the age, just 24. When we knew that my sister was close, we made our way to Boylston Street. As we left the restaurant, we found ourselves behind the finish line. And I turned to the group and I said, we're 20 feet on the wrong side. Let's go. Let's move. Follow me. This crowd in front of us just suddenly left, so we took advantage of it and moved up. We got even closer. I just asked my brother where he was. He's like, I'll be in front of the Forum. It's been a fantastic marathon Monday here at Forum. Again, we're here till 4 o'clock, but the party will continue. We weren't trying to catch any specific runner or anything. We just decided we would go towards the finish line and kind of cheer for some people. Oh my God. Something blew up. Something blew up. We've had an attack. Oh my god. Oh my god. We've had an explosion on the marathon course, feet from the finish line. Two explosions went off, one after the other. Large explosions. We've had an attack here in the city of Boston. Let's watch for the secondary devices. There was only 12 seconds in between both bombs, but it felt so much longer. When it went off, I didn't hear it. I didn't feel it. I was on the ground and I looked down and I saw that I had no foot. When I turned over, and I could see that my brother had no leg either. First responders I know came right over, but time felt like it was standing still. As you could still hear the sound of the blast going off, we were already starting to drive. There was a large pool of blood. JP, he had a pulse, but his blood pressure was probably 0. A lot of people there were still smoking, their clothes were still on fire. Civilian bystanders were taking off their own clothes, their own belts. They were using everything they could trying to stop the bleeding. It had blown out both my ear drums. I tried to sit up and I couldn't sit up. What remained of her legs were graphically impacted. The blood was being pumped out with every heart beat onto the sidewalk. I kept repeating, no, no, this didn't happen. This can't happen. This couldn't have happened. I looked over at Patrick and what I remember is seeing his foot detached, laying next to me. And I remember trying to use my purse to tie a tourniquet around his leg. And I was trying to lean forward to block him. I didn't want him to see how his leg looked. Someone ran over to me and just said, you're on fire, you're on fire, and started to push me down on the ground. When they lifted me up, he put his hand on the stretcher, and I just remember him saying, we'll figure this out and I love you. I was brought to the first aid tent, and then Patrick never came in. And that's when the panic really set in. I just, um, I know how thoughtful and kind Patrick is and I was worried that he was going to, like, defer help for everyone else before he took it for himself. And I was worried that he didn't realize how bad his injuries were, that he could bleed to death on the street. I got a text from my dad that said, mom's critical. Get to Boston Medical Center. Can't find Syd. All of a sudden, my mom was gone, my dad was gone. It seemed like literally everyone had disappeared. The first one that approached me was a marine. So he knew what to do in these types of situations. He could see that a piece of shrapnel had gone into my thigh and severed my femoral artery. He told his friend to literally put his hands inside my leg and hold my artery. He had to stop me from bleeding out. He was talking in a very low voice and telling me, you're going to be OK. You're going to be OK. Boston on the day of the Boston marathon, there have been two explosions near the finish line. Fox News is reporting that three of the people involved in this explosion have died. They're just loading one ambulance after another. As soon as it's loaded, it is on its way out and they're on their way. They're blocking down certain streets within a one or two mile radius of the explosion. It's just absolutely heartbreaking when you think about the spirit of this day. People in Boston participate in this world class event and enjoy bringing their children, bringing their families. This will never be the same. My name is Ed Davis. I'm the police commissioner for the city of Boston. We are in the process of securing the most complex crime scene that we've dealt with in the history of our department. We are doing that under the direction of the FBI and in partnership with the ATM. - Everybody go, go. We gotta go. Everybody go. Everybody go. It was absolute pandemonium inside that hospital. The smell of burnt hair, burnt skin. My dad just kept saying, mom's legs are gone. They're gone. There's nothing they can do. And he just kept weeping. It might have been two hours until we even knew that Sydney was in the hospital. I was almost gone. I can remember hearing, her lips are going purple and her eyes are going white. Her body temperature is dropping and she's losing too much blood. And I thought, this is it for me. My son Paul called me from the ambulance to tell me that he was hurt real bad. When I finally found out that he had lost his leg and still had no idea where JP was, I firmly believed JP was dead. They said when I got to the hospital, I had one pint of blood left in me. I wanted to try to call my mother and tell them I loved them, because I wasn't sure what was going to happen, if I was going to make it or not. The first memory I have after the bombing was waking up with my parents by my side, crying and telling me that my leg was gone and that Jess was going into surgery. They knew she was going to lose one leg, possibly the second. I just can't even imagine what those-- we were out of it for that time, and they were at the peak of fear with the rest of the city. This will be a worldwide investigation. We will go where the evidence and the leads take us. We will go to the ends of the earth to identify the subject or subjects who are responsible for this despicable crime. Two devices, 200 meters apart. That's a big crime scene. We're trying to document the scene, collect the evidence. Short of a nuclear bomb going off, if you blow something up, chances are we're going to be able to pick up the pieces, kind of reassemble it back together, figure out what the bomb is made of. When we were frantic to try to identify the subjects. They just set off two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. What are these guys going to do next? I want to stress that any information that you have, any videos or photographs that happened, not just at that scene, but anywhere in the immediate vicinity, could be helpful to this investigation. This was a heinous and cowardly act. And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism. Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror. It was a living hell to have two boys be in two different hospitals with those injuries at the same time. Walking from Beth Israel to Brigham's to CJP. I don't-- that part is just like, sorry, it's just a blur. I don't remember. Both of them were in surgery at the same time. And even though they're older, they're still your kids, and you want to be there for both of them. I had to literally pick and choose. One day JP was just getting out of the surgery and was in recovery and then Paul had spiked a fever of 105 and he was turning septic. So really, when I tell you the first two weeks was a nightmare, it really was a nightmare. Growing up, my mom was my dad, my mom, and a friend all in one. In the house, it was my mom and us, the kids. Just picture five kids that want everything, and she would work however many jobs she had to do. I was 17 when I had JP, young and dumb, a senior in high school, and I had Paul not too long after that. It was tough, being a kid and having a child. But we grew up together. My brother and I were 18 months apart. People thought we were twins. Growing up, he was a pain. When you're the older brother trying to do things with your friends and he's trying to tag along and stuff. But now you just can't wait for him to tag along. I was in the roofer's union, he was in the sheet metal union. Everybody else would describe him as this big, rough, tough guy, and I just look at him as my little brother, but big little brother. I would ask every day, can I speak to Paul now? My mother would be like, well, he's in surgery. She didn't want me to worry about him. They put Paul in a medically induced coma for nine days. There wasn't a day that I didn't see him. So not seeing him, it really just sucked. We were in separate hospitals for five weeks. Our wounds were so complex. We were going to the operating room every other day. I stabilized first and my medical team brought me over to see Patrick. I was so grateful he was alive. This was my husband. We agreed we were going to figure life out together, and so we're going to figure this out too. The first time we met, I was at my buddy's house from PC, and we were watching the college football national championship. So I was hanging out with him, drinking beers, eating junk food. And Jess lived in the same apartment building, so she came by to say hi to our friend Tom. I was expecting just to find my friend in there. I didn't know there was going to be a cute guy on the couch. And he barely looked at me. He had his hat pulled down real low. I figured he was really into the football game. I think Tom offered for me to stay. But she stayed at the doorway, because she had just come from working out. I remember kind of trying to smell my armpit. What did you physically notice about me? That you were in incredibly good shape. That's not what you told me. What did I say? My legs. Oh. Among other things. He had told me my legs, which just has stood out for me. We were living off of my salary as an oncology nurse. Patrick was a full time student. And we just couldn't have been happier. I just remember that time as total and complete happiness. And something that it felt earned, because we had worked so hard. The next memory I have is when they put Sydney and I together. All I knew was Sydney almost died on the cold Boston sidewalk. And it was so good to see her. Obviously, she got her pretty looks from you, huh? Great to see you. You look good. You look real good. When I was in the hospital, I had three Marines come into my room. That was a very pivotal moment. I hadn't seen anyone like me, a double amputee. I can't do anything right now. Right now yes, but I'm telling you with all my heart, you are going to be more independent than you ever were. I'm so glad you're here. I can't believe it's the same. It's meant the world to me. There were so many visitors. I had no idea the scope and the impact that this had on not only Boston, but the country, the world. One day some nurses came over to me and said that there was someone that wanted to come and see us, Sydney and I, and he was very nervous. She explained to me that he was a photographer for the Boston Globe. This photograph, it ends up being on the front page of The Globe And on the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. And I didn't know at the time who she was. - I - was in the hospital when I saw the photograph for the first time. It was so overwhelmingly real, because it brings you right back to it. When I first got to the railing, a Boston police officer said, "Please do not exploit the situation." And I knew exactly what he meant. I think I have a huge responsibility. I represent the public who cannot be there. But I felt I took something away from Sydney and Celeste. I showed them so vulnerable, helpless, laying on the ground. Just didn't sit right with me. He just sort of timidly came into the room and he introduced himself. I mean, his voice was shaking. He was very emotional. And he said, I just wanted to apologize. And I said, those pictures are so important, because the world needs to know how horrific this is, and that this can't happen again. I said, I don't know how I can make up to you for doing what I did, but I would like to document your recovery for however long it takes. We let him into our lives and a friendship just developed. It was a little bit of healing for us. With three people killed and more than 170 people injured in the explosions at the Boston Marathon finish line, President Barack Obama will be heading to Boston this morning for an interfaith service. The FBI says it has evidence that indicates one of the bombs was a pressure cooker that contained nails and ball bearings and was hidden in a backpack. The bombs included items almost anybody could buy, and so an initial look at the evidence does little to narrow down. This huge montage of pictures, layer upon layer upon layer. And that's what all the investigators are looking at. Everybody was sending us emails. We had something like 70 terabytes of relevant digital media evidence. That's a huge amount. What's an anomaly in a crowd of 10,000 people? Somebody that's wearing a hat that says, "I'm the terrorist"? That's a very hard thing to look for. We used facial recognition software, and it didn't work. I mean, you have to have bodies in front of computers clicking the mouse going through all of this stuff. And we had probably over 100 analysts clicking through video after video, photograph after photograph, 24 hours a day, trying to see whatever that could be identified that might be of relevance. I had a call from the superintendent of the state police saying, we have some intelligence I want to show you. And he showed me the grainy images. They see a photo of a guy faced away from the finish line, wearing a white hat backwards. He's relatively close proximity to where we think the bomb blasts are. And through the photo, they see also what appears to be some kind of bag at the feet. And you can watch him in the video, about five minutes before the bombs go off, come into the frame with a backpack, tilt his shoulder, and you can see the bag come off. He set the bomb behind a group of children watching the Boston Marathon. Then you fast forward to the moment the first blast went off. He's just slowly walking up the street. And just as he is leaving the viewfinder, that second blast goes off. And now we've visually identified who becomes known to us as White Hat. We expand out that triage and analysis and we find Black Hat, also carrying a backpack. Now we have Black Hat and White Hat. We found out later that they were brothers. There was a robust debate about making the images public. At that point, there had been at least one person misidentified by a newspaper. We didn't know how many people were involved, who were they connected to, was there more? So I supported making the images public, but not before the President leaves. When you got two bombers on the run and you've got to bring the President of the United States and the First Lady in, that's a lot of resources, a lot of manpower. But the city needed the President. Our country needed the President to be here with us. Scripture tells us to run with endurance the race that is set before us. And so we come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss. But we also come together today to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted. As you begin this long journey of recovery, your country is with you. We will all be with you as you learn to stand and walk and yes, run again. Of that I have no doubt. You will run again. They sought to intimidate us, to terrorize us, to shake us from those values that make us who we are as Americans. Well, it should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it. All right, Boston. This is our fucking city. And nobody gonna dictate our city. Stay strong. Thank you. To see all these people and knowing that they were cheering for us was-- I broke down in tears because it was so-- it's just. The whole city was wrapped up in this somehow. It was incredibly humbling to be beneficiary of all that goodwill, despite all the evil that was mustered to hurt us in the first place. Get those hands further in front of you so you can step into them. There you go. My right leg was there and looked reminiscent of what I used to have. But it was very deformed, pieced together. I just really couldn't understand what it meant to salvage your limb. Trust the chair. I was in constant pain whenever I was bearing weight. I just feel like it's all my weight on the very bottom. That's what I feel. It was one surgery after another surgery after another surgery. You try another limb salvage surgery and you put all this hope into this surgery and you get up on it finally and you realize, this isn't going to work. I'm still in pain all the time. - A - little bit more weight than what you've been doing and step through with the other leg. Yeah, there you go. But I said, they are going to have to kill me before they take this other leg. Over my dead body are they taking this other leg from me. How are you feeling? I feel sad. Really sad. How come? It's a long story. When I daydream a lot, I picture our old apartment. Hello. Welcome to our guest room that doubles as our living room when you're not visiting. This room is 16 by 12. 17 by 11. No. 17 by 11. Come on in. Let's do some dishes. It was this 100-year-old building. I think it was like a 600 square foot apartment. I mean, you have to be in love to live in 600 square feet with someone. We don't have a dishwasher, but we do have this giant old fashioned sink. Patrick was doing better and feeling better. So I think it was kind of the beginning of us really being just in very, very different places. - I - was attracted to her and married her because she's such a vibrant person. It's hard to see her not only suffer medically, but also psychologically, because it just sucks the life out of her. This is stripping her of so many different things. Ready? Set? Go. Jump. There you go. Getting Rescue was the first time that it felt like we were adding something back to our life. And even though he was related to my injuries and the bombing, he didn't know that. Rescue, ready? Go! This could be too hard. Are you ready? Fetch phone. I was very focused on what he was going to physically help me with. Good boy! I was really caught off guard by how much he just made us laugh. I do remember the sensation that comes with a really just joyful laugh and being kind of surprised by it, because I hadn't felt it for a while. When Paul told me he was coming home, I'm like, what am I going to do? We live on a second and third floor of a two family house. He was coming home with no leg. That's when reality kicked in, to see them have to crawl up the stairs or go down on their butt. Paul ended up doing pretty well. I had a bunch of stuff going on. My left leg was not mobile. I could only bend it like 39 degrees. 50% of my body was burned, so I was still in so much pain. I was in rehab when Paul went home. Kelly stayed with me the whole time. When he opened his eyes in the hospital, he said, you don't deserve this. That was one of the first things he said. I said, I deserve you, you deserve me. We're not saying that ever again. Let's move on. But things like this change people, no matter what. I didn't know how this was going to change JP. I thought my life was going to be in a wheelchair. I've seen people with prosthetics, but I didn't know anybody. Now with the prosthetics I'm able to go up and down the stairs. I want to be doing all the stuff he talked about. Driving. I really just want to walk again more than anything. Try to crank it once. Slide your butt off the wheelchair. That'll be something. Don't slide. We've already picked you up off the floor. It was still really hard to comprehend what had happened, especially when I looked at my mother and just saw that her legs were gone. And I almost died and my family had to deal with that. I had quite a few procedures. Because my artery was severed, they harvested a vein from the opposite leg. I had a hole blown through my foot. So I'm missing bone and tendon. So I have stents and coils in my leg. I was trying to put on a brave face. I was so eager to be getting out of the hospital, but I was so heartbroken to be leaving my mom. The first set of legs that I was given were basic, basic technology legs. They just feel so unnatural. It feels like you're on stilts. I thought I was never going to be able to walk. She was crying every single day for hours, and it was the hardest thing to watch. Never in my life have I seen Celeste and felt her sob so deeply. I mean, her body shakes and moves. - I - remember when she walked down for the first time. To walk five or six steps took her two or three minutes. And with tears in her eyes she goes, do you think I'm ever going to be able to walk on my own? And by that afternoon, she was walking outside the parallel bars on her own. It feels like my real foot. I feel like I'm coming down on a heel and rolling forward. I had met Stan Patterson, a prosthetist. He invented prosthetics so that you could do more things. You were more stable on your feet. You had it. Just trust me. That trip to Florida was huge, because it gave us hope. There you go. After that, she didn't cry every day. - Yes! - Woohoo! Good afternoon. My name is Richard Deloria. I am the Special Agent in charge of the FBI's Boston division. After a very detailed analysis of photo, video, and other evidence, we are releasing photos of these two suspects. They are identified as Suspect One and Suspect Two. We consider them to be armed and extremely dangerous. No one should approach them. No one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement. We knew when we did that, we had to brace for impact. Because essentially, what we're telling them is, we have your photos, we're coming for you. Our hope was that somebody would see these and quickly enough call us. Our fear was that we give them that head's up and they cause more death and destruction. Officer Sean Collier was on the campus of MIT and he's parked alongside one of the buildings there. The two subjects came from around the side and executed him. The subjects tried to get officer Collier's weapon. But unless you know how to get a gun out of that holster, it's not coming out. Less than an hour after the killing of Officer Collier, the subjects fill pull one a victim, pulled over to the side of the road. He gets carjacked. They force him to give over his ATM card and his PIN. Ending up at this gas station, the one brother walks in to go get snacks. The carjacking victim overheard that they may be going to New York. The other brother is distracted with the GPS and the phone. So the victim of the carjacking makes a break for it and runs across the street to another gas station. He's begging the clerk, please call the police. These guys just carjacked me. They're terrorists. You need to call the police. The one brother that had been in the car runs into the store, grabs the other brother. 911 recorded line. Hello, please help me. 911 OPERATOR : Hello, sir. Please help me, please help me. Someone took my car. Just take a deep breath. OK. Tell me what happened. Somebody took your car? Yes. He's saying that the people that carjacked him were the Boston Marathon bombers and they just killed a police officer. Mercedes, they have some kind of GPS device, and it's in the vicinity of Watertown. This night happened to be a very, very small shift. We had four route cars on the street and myself. We got a call from Cambridge PD. They just pinged the vehicle in question on the carjacking. It's in the area of 61 Dexter Ave. It's a 2013 Mercedes. Myself and the other officer, we both start heading towards it. Office Reynolds calls out right away and says, OK, I see the vehicle. I can see the cruiser. And said, OK Joey, I'm pulling up behind you. Light 'em up. We're thinking couple of kids stole a car. They're gonna start running, we're gonna chase them down, we're gonna lock them up. I see the Mercedes. There's a Honda in front of it. I see the flash of the gun and they had a lot of hardware on their side. Multiple shots fired. Multiple shots fired. The five or six officers from Watertown, none of them had ever shot their gun before on duty. And then ting, ting. And it was metallic. And Joey Reynolds goes Sarge, run. Run. Loud explosion, loud explosion! They have explosives, some type of grenade. Gunshots coming from one side of the vehicle, gunshots coming from the other side of the vehicle. These Watertown officers are in the firefight of their lives. And they strike the older brother with a couple of rounds and they end up tackling him. At the same time as they're wrestling around with him on the ground, the younger brother gets into the car and then heads straight for the officers. Less than a second, he was right here, right at us. Brother runs over his own brother and he gets drug for about 25 yards. The vehicle just keeps going, littered with bullets, up over the hill, and he's gone. The older brother succumbs to his injuries. But the younger brother just disappears into that neighborhood. There's a lot of chaos. But we had those perimeters up real fast. We found the vehicle about 3/4 of a mile down the street with the door open. Boston Marathon bombing one suspect killed, his brother the subject of a massive manhunt in Watertown. Police believe the man is on foot and likely hiding. The first time we learn their names is at the hospital. The older brother is expired and we roll the fingerprints. Within 30 seconds, we have his name. We're able to pull up photos of his brother. At least we know now who they are. And there was a massive, massive response. Looking at that response, you would think we were invading a country. We're about to hit rush hour right on the edge of the city of Boston, where hundreds of thousands of people are coming out. We had terrorists on the run. They had bombs. We're trying to weigh the safety of everybody. And that's where the decision was made to shelter in place all the surrounding cities and towns, including the city of Boston. It is important that folks remain indoors, keep the doors locked, and not open the door unless there is a uniformed, identified law enforcement officer on the other side. We had between 3,000 and 4,000 officers here in Watertown. And we started to methodically search that 20 block area. We were going house to house, door to door. So we complete the searches by 5 o'clock. The decision was made to lift the lock down. And less than 40 minutes later, we received a call from Dave Henneberry down on Franklin Street. 911, what's your emergency? I have a boat in my yard. There's blood all over the inside. There's a person in the boat. 911 OPERATOR : Are you sure? I just looked in the boat. We have a person in the boat, a live party. Return to poke a hole through the boat. We were getting video from the helicopter in the command post. There's definitely movement in the boat. All right, there's definitely movement in the boat. Get the thermal. That's how they're doing it. Everyone hold their fire. Hold their fire. All units hold your fire. Hold your fire. The big concern was that he would have a bomb strapped to his chest. You need to evacuate that area. They're going to try to make their way into the backyard. All units, stand by for the bang. Stand by for the bang. All units, stand by for the bang. Do not return fire. The decision was made to shoot flash bangs. It's a distraction technique. Try to get him out of the boat. There is movement on the boat. Target's sitting up in the boat. Further movement. Target's sitting up. He appears to be covered in blood. Go ahead. Medic, medic. He's in custody. He's in custody. to command. Subject in custody. Subject in custody. Subject in custody. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was taken to Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess hospital in serious condition with multiple gunshot wounds. Federal officials say the bombing suspect was transferred overnight to a prison medical center. The hospital is located at Fort Devens, a former army base. It's about 40 miles west. They can continue to care for him until he's completely well enough to be put into another prison, presumably to wait trial here in the Boston area. The one year anniversary was a very important milestone. Physically, I was not well. My leg that I had was a mass. I was in pain all the time, but trying to put on a dress and a smile. So this is an appreciation soiree. We have a beautiful slide show to really show you the road we've been on and how all of you have been an incredible part of our lives. Try to make me go to rehab. I said no, no, no. I started to play this role of, I'm supposed to be better. It's been a year. And I think our friends and families all wanted that for us. It was easier to play the part than to be really honest with myself about where I was. We were just beginning to realize the complexity of Jess's injury to her right leg. And so we went to experts around the country to ask their opinions. And while they had ideas, once we sat with them for a little while, it didn't seem terribly practical. Because they're seeing blast injuries for the first time. And we need people who have seen this often. Who gets blown up? The military gets blown up. And it became so clear that Walter Reed was the place that we needed to be. They had the expertise, they had the experience with blast injuries. That just crack? It's very, very rare for a civilian to be at Walter Reed. And we had to prove that we had exhausted all of our options with civilian care. I've repeatedly been totally blindsided by how hard it's been, how long it's been. I mean, particularly blast related injuries, complications are more the norm than the exception. Most people think of an amputation as something that you get fit with a prostheses and you move on with your life, and that couldn't be further from the truth. You have to think of it as like a chronic disease. When the team was evaluating me, they gave me this book where I was forced to chart every day all the things that I was able to do or stopped doing or just couldn't even attempt because of pain. I think being a nurse, I wanted proof, I wanted scientific evidence of why I had to lose this leg. So this is December 26th is today. So you got walked Rescue. Just now I said an eight out of 10. I didn't unload the groceries. Patrick did. Is that your energy was low or your pain was high or both? Pain was high. Oh, and I walked to get a coffee. No, that's activities avoided. Oh, I didn't go. She was in this emotionally wrenching decision. And Jess sort of let me in enough to see that as they were going through it. The book just gave me this glaring evidence. How much more per minute can you Get sawing off a leg? There is no turning back. And they're hoping it's going to make things better, but there are no guarantees. We just saw and felt Jess's exhaustion and desperation. She was really getting sucked dry. No matter how much she loved having a leg and loved having toes to do things like stick them in the sand, she was in so much pain, it became hard for her to go about her life. This was certainly the most scary decision I've ever made. I had to believe in it as much as I could and just let go. I have so many scars from the marathon. This is where a piece of shrapnel hit me. Those weren't placed there by my choice. So these tattoos are kind of a cathartic way for me to mark my body the way I want to. My daughter had been through a car accident and almost died. And this coming right on the heels of it. She was suicidal for a while. - I - felt as if the universe didn't want me here. It really made me feel that I had no control over anything. So I tried to control what went into my body. Eating has been a bit of a challenge, to be completely honest. My eating disorder has always manifested whenever something traumatic does happen. But there was something about the bombing. My eating disorder amplified 10 times more. I'm still battling. But for my whole family to be together, I don't know what I would do without them. - Hi, John. - Hey, how you doing? Syd. - Hi. So good to see you. I know. So I got an updated book. - Oh my gosh. - Yep. I don't know. Oh my gosh. There's more photos in there. You know what I mean? Uncle John. John why don't you come on inside and we'll tell you all about it? Oh my god. Every time I see that picture, I remember your tears, because you were crying so much. That was the best hug anybody could ever have. This was right around Christmas time last year. At Carmen's. I had the same shirt on. And look, life goes on. Kevin, you look sad. I know. You look sad, Kevin. What are you thinking? I was thinking about the girls. Will we ever be us again? And I knew we wouldn't. It's taken a huge toll on my dad. He was a head to toe just covered in blood. And there were pieces of skin and hair burned onto his clothing. He held on pretty strong, but he started to unravel. He turned to alcohol. We felt like we lost him. You're powerless. Absolutely helpless. I wish I could have protected them somehow. And my inability to change and give them back what they had is hard. You like to think you have it in check, but there's no way you can erase what you saw. Everybody has post-traumatic stress. We go to therapy. We just try and work through it as best we can. - That better? - Yeah. I think so. It's just hard. It's lots of core and lots of stability on this side. That side is really weak. Not having legs makes everything we do harder. When I am at my most vulnerable, I just kind of shut up and suck it up and try to get through it. That's it. Almost there. - Watch. Watch. That's it,. Being at Walter Reed, most of them, their injuries are far worse than anything that any of the survivors from the bombing have experienced. So when you see that, it snaps you out of your funk pretty quickly. And I think we've both been surprised by the kinds of friendships that we've made there. I don't know if you heard, but I did over 1,000. See it in his face right there. It's like you're Rafiki holding Simba up. You got to just. Keep your arms straight. I have attempted every day to remind myself and ourselves of the fact that we are guests at Walter Reed and to be welcomed by them. It's one of the greatest honors that I've ever been a part of. This is a bomb, an IED, no different than what we've experienced in Afghanistan on US soil. In my line of work, it's an occupational hazard. But they were on home soil in Boston. Should never have happened. Let's get ready to rumble! Let's go. Push up club. Yeah. Up! Ready, exercise. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. This is what you asked for. My girlfriend Kelly and I, we're going to get married. And I was trying to figure out the best way to provide for us. All you get told in the hospital is how expensive prosthetics are. They can range from 10,000 to 150,000 and you need a leg every three to five years. You don't know if you going to work again. What's that pallet up front? That's the tub and all the fixtures. I couldn't do the labor like I was doing before. So I was thinking about starting a company. I was talking to Jim Allen. He was the EMT who saved my life and we've been friends ever since. He was telling me how he was interested in doing an addition on his house. So I'm like, what, did someone mess with you and tell you to say that to me? And he's like, no, why? And I'm like, well, I'm opening my own company. And he showed me plans and he's like, let's do it. That became my first job. I felt really cool to give something back to Jim that he couldn't do for himself. Now I get to rebuild this house. He helped me rebuild my life. All the amputees from the marathon are so very close. Most of them came to JP's wedding. Although we met them a short time ago, they're like family. When someone does have a great moment, I feel like we're all celebrating. And if I was going to try dancing on two high heel prosthetic legs, I was going to be somewhere where there was seven other amputees to help scrape me up off the floor. Paul and JP, their lives have forever changed. But they've accepted it. And they've moved on with their life. I just find it hard. It's been a fantastic marathon Monday here at Forum. Again, we're here till 4 o'clock. Come down and join us. Something happened. Holy shit. I have probably watched that video 3,000 times. The first time I physically threw up, and then the second time I cried, and then I got angry. Just watch it all the time. It consumed my life. It was crazy to see how close they were. And my JP was literally elbow to elbow with him. He's right in the circle with him. My boys wanted me to let go of the marathon. But I wanted to know what happened to them and why. We were trying to put together some sort of profile of what Tomerlin Tsarnaev and his younger brother were all about, why they did what they did. Both of the brothers were athletes. One was a wrestler. One was into boxing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man in the white hat, he is 19 years. He's a quiet student who never talked politics and a pothead. He's a student at UMass Dartmouth who lived in the Pinedale dorms. Older brother left school in order to pursue boxing, was actually a competitive boxer here in the United States. The Tsarnaev family moved from Dagestan, a republic in Russia's north caucuses. Well now wait a minute. How did these guys get here? What were they doing? What was the family trying to do? So we were trying to put together a picture of what had gone wrong. Who are these people? Where did this messed up family come from? Tamerlan Tsarnaev. I was going to become the boxer that my dad never became. And I was going to make money and that was going to set us up. That failed. Now he's looking for greater meaning. Some struggle that's going to matter. And then he found his calling. I want to change the world and blow people up in the name of Islam. Now I'm serving my purpose, this greater purpose. You hear this profile very often in people who join radical destructive causes. Major development in the Boston bombing investigation. We now know that at least two American security organizations were tipped off by the Russians. It came in as foreign government information that said, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was possibly becoming a bad guy. May go back to where he's from to do bad things. If you have any information that can help us, please do so. This is very low level information. But we did everything that we were allowed and able to do, and we saw nothing. It is true that at the beginning of 2012, Tamerlan Tsarnaev shows up in Dagestan possibly saying, put me in touch with the radicals. But he doesn't come anywhere near the radicals, to the jihadists. There wasn't a cell. There isn't a pipeline from Dagestan to the United States that's producing more of these. He is homegrown. It can happen again to anyone who's got a computer. We know that they read Inspire Magazine. What is this magazine Inspire? It was done by the American born jihadists. And what they wanted to do was target English speaking young American Muslim men. It's everything from profiling jihadist heroes to how to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom. He was described like a teenager that was not much different than my son and his friends. And there was this notion that wow, just one day, he becomes this violent jihadist. Before that, he was this wrestling team captain at a Cambridge public high school. People felt that Tamerlan was the mastermind, that he was almost like the bully that ordered Dzhokhar to do this. But Dzhokhar did not exactly obey his brother. Tamerlan was on his case to pray more, party less, for quite a while. And Dzhokhar went ahead and became a fairly significant pot dealer on campus. Dzhokhar in the boat, this is justification for what America does to Muslims in the world. They decided that in the name of their faith, it's OK to be blowing up 8-year-old kids. And that's what makes them monsters. A large segment of the population around here did not want to know anything more about the bombers. And so here I am, a newspaper reporter writing a story. The story comes out. I got hate mail. How dare you write that? You have no idea what it must feel like for the victims. I hope the Muslims blow one of your loved ones up. Then you'll know what it's like. I guess I understand. Ever turn on the TV on September 11? So I've watched that plane fly into that building probably 500 times. And my dad was in it. And I can't avoid it. I can't get away from it. Because everybody wants to know, how did it happen? God, I understand that. Why did we do this story? Because we had to figure out, what's next and how do we prevent this from happening? And the only way to do that is to figure out who these people are. And we failed, because we didn't get the moment when he said, OK, I'm going to blow up the Boston Marathon. Did you bring any other paper that was upstairs? This is cute paper. Sweetie, who's this from for? That's to Jessica from Santa. He came early? We were initially so relieved they were still alive. I struggle more now because I see how permanent it is. Do you want me to help you? Yeah. I get to do more with Jessica, but it reminds me too of what she can't do. OK. Already this is challenging wrapping sitting down. What if you rotated it the other way? No, you've got it. She was the caretaker. She took care of everybody. When I was sick, when grandma was sick, she knew in her head that she was going to be the one to take care of us. And that's hard for her. Rescue, are you ready? You hungry? In August, she got to run for the first time. And then she drove us to these wineries out in Virginia, and then we had a lovely dinner at the end of the day. And I remember thinking that, you know what? The people were right. It does get better. I never thought we would have a magical day like this again, and here it is. And as soon as we left her to go back to California. Days later. She started with all her physical problems. There's something about my anatomy. My bones keep resorbing and forming all these kinds of pokey bones. And it's not allowing me to heal. Every time I went back to the OR, it's about a six week recovery. So I've been in the wheelchair pretty regularly. God, I hate to-- I know how much you love to have surgery, but I mean, if you're working against your anatomy here, I think you've got to do something to correct that. I've reached this point where the care team at Walter Reed can't figure it out either. I guess how I'm feeling today is just-- I'm just really tired. I'm just really tired. I think I just ran out of hope and energy. I don't know. I was looking at kind of killing time on Facebook this morning and the thing pops up that tells you four years ago today, I posted a picture that Patrick and I had just gotten engaged. It's so sad to look at that picture, because we were so happy. I would do anything and go back. It feels like a whole another lifetime ago somehow. All of a sudden, your body's torn apart. Your relationships change. Your idea of the future changes. The way you see the world is so different. Really, it's an identity crisis. Being an amputee is my identity right now. Every single one of our good friends have had a baby since the bombing. For me it's been the most kind of dagger to the heart subject. This is our reality. This is our real life. I miss them a lot. I miss them. I miss them all the time. Some days all I see are feet. Everybody's got legs. You almost feel less of you. I used to maybe sometimes walk with a strut or something, if I felt like I looked good or whatever, and now I feel like I walk like a freak. I believe just two. Two, right? Two bags we're checking. I've always loved, loved the beach. It just killed me that my toes weren't going to be in the sand. So I called my boss just in Florida and I said, is it possible? I've heard that there is such a thing as beach legs. So he said, absolutely. So what we did is we took a high density foam and put it into a triangle and then sprayed it with a seal. So not only does it add float now, exactly, the water displaces away from it. Run Forrest, run. Got to walk before you can run. Thank you. heart attack. Kevin. She wants to run. You signed the waiver, right? Them watching me accomplish things that I hadn't done before kind of heals everybody. Should we break a bottle of champagne over the legs first? - We might get trouble for that. - The maiden voyage. I don't feel as clunky and clumsy, and it gives me a sense of peace. The beach has always been a special, special place for me. With my beach legs, I could walk on the sand. Nobody had to carry me on their back. It was kind of like being the old Celeste. A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was chosen following nearly two months of jury selection. Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the finish line bombings that killed three and injured more than 260 people at the 2013 Boston Marathon. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, he could face the death penalty. Even though we are not a death penalty state, the trial was in federal court, and death penalty is at play if it's a terrorist case. So that was on the line for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. This is not about acquitting Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. This is about avoiding the death penalty. In Judy Clark's opening, to most shocking thing or set the tone for the trial, was when she said he did it. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did put a bomb on Boylston, did cause carnage, did kill three people there. She said there's little we dispute. All we're talking about really is why. The evidence is so overwhelming. - I - was asked to testify. I wish that I had the opportunity to walk into the courtroom. They had just identify and circle me on the teleprompter. But instead she drew a heart. And the entire court just started laughing. I remember the prosecutor saying, Ms. Kensky, that is not a circle. So much was taken from us, but not my sense of humor and not my wit. In a way, I dreaded the trial, because it stirred up so many emotions. But those terrorist, they cannot win. I just wanted to tell my story and make sure that he knows that I'm not afraid of him. And I want him to know that he did not break me. It made me feel like I was in charge for once. What came through is these extraordinary stories of first responders and ordinary people coming and rising above and saving lives. There were 90 people who were transported to the hospital within 30 minutes. 90 people who could have died. That's how serious their injuries were. And everyone that was transported to a hospital survived. I went every day by myself. It was something I had to do, I wanted to know everything I could find out about who and why and how they did it. The defense wanted to establish he was in a crazy household surrounded by irresponsible, crazy people. Parents moving back to Dagestan, Dzhokhar being left here with the older brother as the only older influence in his life. The defense theory was that the big brother made him do it. The prosecutor said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was radicalized on his own. He didn't need his big brother to read stuff that was put out by al-Qaeda. He did it on his own. Dzhokhar paid for the rental of two nine millimeter guns, like the Ruger that was used, and that the both of them engaged in target practice at a gun range. This evidence, so much of this stuff is actually on videotape. Nothing captured the horror of what happened that day than to listen to the sound. I remember at one point hearing Krystle Campbell's death wail. And it sounds like a cliche when you say something cuts through you. But I remember hearing that and it felt like something passed through me. Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old woman from Medford, so loved by her friends that she was a bridesmaid 17 times. The prosecutor asked Bill Campbell, what do you miss most about Krystle? And he said, the hug. She hugged me every day. Sean Collier's family testified. Sean's mother couldn't get out of bed for months. Lingzi Lu, the Chinese graduate student at Boston University, was an only child. Imagine that Lingzi's parents allow her to come to America and are proud of her beyond their dreams, and then she doesn't come home. The government wanted to show that Tsarnaev did not just kill Sean Collier. He did not just kill Lingzi Lu. He killed a part of these families. That there was something missing from these families that would never allow them to be the families that they were before. The entire Richard family experienced that horror on that day. The family who lost their 8-year-old son, Martin. Jane lost her leg. Henry had witnessed it all. Denise lost one of her eyes. Bill, much of his hearing. The Boston Marathon was always a special day for our family. The start of spring. A T ride into the city to cheer on the runners. We didn't miss many, if any over the last 10 years. The Richard family went to the Boston Marathon year after year. It was the family tradition. They were there to cheer for other people. I wasn't really sure how it was going to look kid sized. There was this picture that emerged in the immediate aftermath of this 8-year-old boy holding up a sign that said, "No more hurting people. Peace." And that was the ultimate symbol of what we lost and what was attacked. The prosecutor provided the cut line. She said, this is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant, and unchanged. Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused. And without assistance, he remains the unrepentant killer that he is. I was covering the trial every day, because I thought, you know what? I'm going to learn more. This will help me figure out the psychological mystery of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. But after listening to every word of testimony, I still couldn't really figure out how a kid who had a potentially promising future could commit such a horrendous violent act. What was that tipping point? The prosecutor said there is no explanation for how heinous the acts that this fellow committed, except in his character. That is why the death penalty is appropriate and just. The defense said, even if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev believed in an for an eye, even if he still believes that, she said, that's not who we are. The Richards sent an open letter to the Boston Globe in which they explained why they believe that the death penalty should be taken off the table. Their family suffered horrendously that way. And here they are saying, they do not want this guy to be put to death. I did not want him to ever be able to hurt anybody ever again, and I wanted him to just disappear from our public consciousness as quickly as possible. And we felt the best way to achieve those two goals was for him to be sentenced to prison for the rest of his life. The Boston Marathon bombing jury has returned to the courtroom with a verdict, a decision of whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will live or die. We do not know what that verdict is quite yet, but we expect that we will in just a few minutes. Now we are getting word from the courtroom. This is breaking news. We are getting word from the courtroom now that on at least some counts, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21 years old, 19 at the time of the bombing, has been sentenced to death. Tsarnaev, now 21, and the youngest of 74 people now on federal death row. But the execution though not any time soon. Years of appeals expected in this, the first death penalty conviction of a terrorist in the post-9/11 era. Oh my god. I'm in shock. I'm in fucking shock. I was never in favor of the death penalty. But in this particular instance, I absolutely want him put to death. There's no winners. It doesn't make me happy. People are still dead. But for someone to have done what he did, in my opinion, you don't deserve to live. It was no secret I wanted the death penalty. The trial gave me a sense of justice. When I first started to do it, I started it from the first-- that was the first article. They did so much in such little time. And I just wanted them to have something. But to me, it's a sad book to me. But when they have kids, maybe their son or daughter will want to know what happened to them, and maybe the Boston Marathon will be in history books and it's all right here. Well, it is Saturday, April 9th. And we decided to head back to Boston a little bit earlier than we planned initially, because we have, well, we have a couple of commitments here and there, and then I guess you have something. Yeah. In a week or so. In a week or so. What is that again? It's a race. It's like a little 5k thing, little jaunt. What's it called though? It has that name. Well, it's in Boston. Oh, it's the marathon. Boston Marathon. Oh yeah. You'll be doing the Boston Marathon. That's the 26.2 miles. I thought it was the 5k. Please say a command. Destination home. Destination home. Looks good. Eight hours. 440 miles. Plenty of podcasts. Plenty of podcasts. You're the only one with the right leg, buddy, so it looks like it's just you today. I'm the only one with a leg. Except for Rescue. We got Rescue back there. All right. When I'm out there running, I think about the terrorist acts that have happened since Boston. What can we do to make this not happen again? What do we learn from this? We now have this very strange expertise in being blown up. So when this happens to someone else, I hope that I can contribute to their healing in some way. I don't know that we could be in more different places. I just can't believe that I'm sitting here now three years after the bombing and haven't really achieved walking on a regular basis. I didn't even want to start running before Jess started to walk. But Jess said, you're ready, and it's time for you to keep pushing yourself too. I absolutely want to see Patrick run the Boston Marathon. But I don't want to be seen. I don't feel like seeing people. I don't want to-- he's my husband and I love and I want to be there for him, but it's hard when I'm feeling so different than he is. Monday, Patriot's Day, we thank you for joining us. WBZ News, Time 7:31. It has a population of about 15,000, but nearly twice that many runners are gathering in Hopkinton this morning for the start of the Boston Marathon. WBZ. Through a lot of what's happened over the last three years, I've just kind of put my head down and keep moving, because if we really stop and think about it for too long, it's pretty demoralizing. As a kid, I was able express emotions through sport. And this seems like a way for me to do that again. I can carry the spirit of the four guardian angels who were killed. I can carry the spirit of our families and friends, our city. I can carry Jess's spirit with me. Let's go to Hopkinton now for the start of the mobility impaired runners. I didn't have any intentions on really go back to the marathon, but this year my wife's going to run the marathon. I'd like to be at the finish line to meet her. This is Clark. Clark, this is Celeste. She's another friend from the marathon bombing. Everything's different from April 15th. Their lives are forever changed. All of our lives. But this is my life now. This is our life. That finish line had been such a happy place for so many people. And they took that away. And this year, we claimed that back. 38.7. Patrick 38.7. - You see him? - What's up, boy? - Good job, Patrick. You got it, dude. Awesome.
