Ciao. Where's Mom? I do not know. Hello Mom. We were starting to worry. Hi, Ann. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Ernestine. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Frank. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Martha. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Bill. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Lillian. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Fred. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Dan. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Jack. - Where were you, Mom? - I'm sorry dear... ... but I met someone from the Engineering Department ... ... and insisted that ... - Oh, hello, Mom. - Hi, Bob, dear. - Where's Jane? - Front. Fifth from the left. The small one. The little one is graduating. The last one. I can hardly believe it. - What, Mom? - Ladies and gentlemen. It is with great honor that I present to you ... ... the class representative, Miss Susan Whittaker ... ... who will tell you about: "Our generation and the challenges of the future". Mr. Dickerson, faculty members ... ... guests of honor and fellow students. It is an important day for us. Yes, it is an important day. And sometimes, Frank, I thought this day wouldn't come. But it had to come ... ... because I promised you, in my heart , that the work would be done. I remember we had just sold the Montclair house ... ... the house you bought for us ... ... and we had moved to another, not as spacious ... ... and not quite as full of memories. I was packing my bags, leaving for conferences ... ... because I was determined to continue your work. I had to. Janey, fai un bel lavoro, laggi�. - Ti ho stirato l'abito da sera, mamma. - Abito da sera? Solo perch� sei un ingegnere non vuol dire che non puoi essere elegante. Grazie, Martha. Ernestine, spolvera il passamano mentre scendi, per favore. - Oh, Tom, vuoi lasciarci? - Certo che no. Dove lo trovo un lavoro cos� facile? Quattordici stanze da pulire, 36 pasti da preparare ogni giorno. Se non avessi lasciato la scuola... ...saprei dirti quanti pasti sono alla settimana. Duecentocinquantadue. - C'� di nuovo il pasticcio? - Non � pasticcio. - � rangoon d'agnello. - Cosa mai � il rangoon d'agnello? � una ricetta. L'abbiamo avuta per generazioni, nella mia famiglia. Dall'odore si direbbe proprio. Vado io. Ciao, cugina Leora. Ciao, Martha. E Janey, vero? Lo sono Ann e lei � Ernestine, cugina Leora. Oh, che sciocca. Vi confondo sempre. - Beh, siamo cos� tante. - Gi�. Non � commovente? - Come vanno le cose? - Benissimo. - Dico alla mamma che sei qui. - Grazie, cara. Glielo dico anche io. Sinceramente. Ogni volta che viene, mi fa sentire come un caso da carit�. - Pu� sentirti. - Spero che mi senta. Dovrebbe star lontana e pensare agli affari suoi. - Buon pomeriggio, Tom. - Buon pomeriggio, signora Simmons. - Vecchia ficcanaso. - Hai detto qualcosa? No, ho solo detto che torno dopo. Tom, chiudi la porta, per favore. - Ciao, Leora. - Ciao, Lilly. Ehi, cosa voleva? � molto semplice. Ho parlato con tuo fratello Bill e con la zia Margaret... ...e siamo tutti d'accordo nel prendere due dei bambini pi� piccoli. Non ci penso neanche. � un'offesa. Capito? Guarda. Te l'ho detto che ti saresti infuriata. Bene, ascoltami, Lilly Gilbreth, e cerca d'essere ragionevole. So che hai speso quasi tutti i soldi dell'assicurazione di Frank. - � cos�, no? - S�. Allora, io ho quella grande casa, su a Westchester, ed � vuota. Ora, se sono disposta a prendere due dei tuoi bambini... ...e dargli alcuni dei vantaggi e cure che tu non potresti dargli... ...perch� dovresti pensare che ti stia offendendo? So che � difficile separarsene. � solo naturale. Ma se hai questi sentimenti, non stai pensando ai bambini. Stai pensando solo a te stessa. - Non ho mai pensato di essere egoista. - Oh, non penso che tu voglia esserlo. Ma questo � il risultato, per loro. Supponi che succeda qualcosa ad uno di loro, mentre sei via. Oh, Leora! Non puoi chiudere gli occhi, Lilly. Devi pensare a queste cose. Vedi che ho ragione. Chiamo Bill e Margaret... ...e gli dico che sei d'accordo. - No. No, devo pensarci. Chiamami stasera. Molto bene, Lilly. Oh, Leora, vuoi restare a cena? Grazie molte, ma penso di no. Ci sono abbastanza bocche da sfamare anche senza di me. Beh, salve, bambini. Oh, piccola cara. Ti piacerebbe venire a stare con me? No. - Chiamami pi� tardi, Leora. - Certo, Lilly. Ciao. - Ciao, bambini. - Ciao. Pronto? S�, Leora. S�, ho deciso. Voglio ringraziare te e Bill e la zia Margaret della vostra gentilezza... ...ma abbiamo deciso di restare insieme. No, parto comunque. Far� le ultime conferenze di Frank. Sono sicura che ne nascer� qualcosa. No, Leora. Temo che una volta separata la famiglia... Allora parti... ...lasciando i bambini al caldo e alle zanzare dello Jersey? No, li mando a Nantucket. No, non da soli. Tom andr� con loro. Mi spiace, Leora. Io... Devo fare ci� che penso sia meglio. Grazie ed arrivederci. Oh, mamma, dai! Quando hai deciso per Nantucket? Non lo so. Mi � venuto in mente adesso. Abbiamo quella casa, l�. Non siamo riusciti a venderla. Ci siamo andati ogni anno, perch� quest'anno no? Certo! Allora, starete attenti, vero? Saremo cos� bravi che nessuno ci noter�. - Non preoccuparti di niente, mamma. - Ci prover�. Oh, andr� tutto bene, mamma. Io prender� il tuo posto. Martha si incaricher� dei soldi e dei pasti. Frank si incaricher� dei ragazzi, Ernestine delle ragazze. E tutti ci prenderemo cura di Tom. Andiamo, ragazzi. Abbiamo solo 20 minuti. - Ci vediamo alla stazione, Ann. - Va bene. Ciao. - Non vengono anche loro? - No, no. Troppo pieno. Come pu� dirlo? Otto valige, un cane, un gatto, un canarino, nove persone... Nove persone? Dovremmo essere solo sette. Uno, due, tre... Mickey e Peter Shermerhorn, scendete da questo taxi, voi due. - Jackie ha detto che potevamo venire. - Mi dispiace, ma non potete. Forza. Fuori di l�. Veloci. Sbrigatevi. Abbiamo abbastanza problemi anche senza portarci i bambini dei vicini. Partiamo. Ciao, Mickey. Ciao, Peter. Oh, Janey. Guarda le bellezze al bagno. Non entrate? Dopo, Frank. Dopo. Ah, ho capito. Guarda quel povero scemo l�. Conosce i piani che avete per lui? - Per favore. Vai via. - Oh, povero Morton. - Morton ci ha appena notato. - Davvero? - Che piano hai in mente? - Nessuno. Assolutamente nessuno. � identico all'anno scorso. Mi sembrava che lo trovassi molto attraente, l'anno scorso. S�. Ma sono cresciuta di un anno, e le donne maturano prima degli uomini. � un ragazzino. Veramente. - Non mi pare un ragazzino. - Ti piace? Mi piace? � uno di Amherst. Beh, arriva. Prendi la palla al balzo quando te la lancio. - Ciao, Ann. - Oh, ciao, Morton. - Ricordi mia sorella, Ernestine? - Oh, s�, ciao. Ann, vuoi andare a nuotare? L'acqua � bella. - Oh, non credo. - Dai. - Ti sfido fino al molo. - Non mi va, Morton. - Se vuoi fare a gara, Ernestine pu�... - Ciao a tutti. - Chi vuole fare a gara fino al molo? - Io. Bene, andiamo allora. Mannaggia, non sei l'unica ad essere maturata, quest'anno. - Oh, Martha � solo una bambina. - Non si comporta da bambina. Beh, grazie di avermi lasciato Morton. Credimi, Ernestine, non hai perso niente. Lo so. Come fai a perdere qualcosa che non hai mai avuto? Combattere, combattere, combattere Combattere ancora per Sagawon Fair Play ALIMENTARI E CARNI Combattere, combattere, combattere Combattere ancora per Sagawon Combattere, combattere, combattere... - Salve, questa � la casa dei Gilbreth? - S�, � questa. - Grazie. - Tu sei nuovo di qui, vero? Gi�. Primo giorno sull'isola, primo giorno di lavoro. - Sono Al Lynch. - Io sono Ernestine Gilbreth. "Cocere" di "pianoscerti". - Quella S vuol dire Syracuse? - No. Universit� Agricola e Tecnica Sagawon. - Me l'hanno data per il football. - Ma � meraviglioso. Tom, vorrei presentarti il signor Lynch, il nostro nuovo fattorino. - Salve. - Signor Lynch. Felice di fare la tua conoscenza. Ora, ti dispiace portare dentro la spesa? O ti serve aiuto? Aiuto? Lo? Ho preso questo lavoro per tenermi i muscoli in forma. Lo fa ogni giocatore di football. Sapete, Fred Grange consegna il gelato, quest'estate. - Qui? - No, no. Da qualche altra parte. M'interessa molto, lui. Giochiamo nella stessa posizione. Interessante. - Che confraternita � quella? - Tau Tau Tau. Sono il capo. - Beh, ci vediamo. - Ci vediamo. Ci vediamo in giro. Cara signora Gilbreth, � iniziato tutto in cucina. L'ho visto con i miei occhi. Io ero l� con Ernestine... ...quando un bel giovane gigantesco � arrivato con la spesa. Oh, Tom! It had the body of an oak and the brain of an acorn. It was love at first sight. Beans. Beans? Beans, beans, beans. Hello, kids hello ao ao Sister Martha has made a special shopping for you - Beans. - Beans? Beans. - Beans for breakfast - And beans for lunch Beans for dinner Boiled beans, bean stew bean soup , baked beans Beans, always beans Martha never gives us ham, chicken or lamb Even if it seems strange We admire it, but who doesn't get tired of eating beans Beans, beans Oh, I never get tired of eating beans, beans, beans - Tau Tau Tau. - Greek. You know what that means? "Property of Al Lynch". Oh, Al. Martha, if I'm going out with a girl, I must have some money in my pocket. I have to buy her something. An ice cream, a drink, a hamburger ... No. I will not eat anything. I just look at it. We have no money to spend on unknown girls. - Ernestine comes in with that big ... - Don't say that, Fred. Well, he never takes any of us for a ride in his van. I start deliveries tomorrow morning at 10. Wait for me. It will wait for you. Hi, Al. Ti abbraccer . "Ti abbraccer�". Puah. Hi everyone. Ciao. - What's going on with you? - Did you hurt your back? Watch. Refined, isn't it? Al? - Oh, no. Not Al Lynch. - Oh, you. You're just jealous because your younger sister got engaged before you. - Hey, are you engaged to him? - Yes. - For real? - Yes. So, put in a couple of steaks one night, right? Oh really. In this family you only think about food. Having nothing to eat. Martha, can't you get some burgers off your budget? The budget provides for meat only for the little ones. - We've all grown up. - Well, I'm not. The years of growth await me. All right. You will have the meat tonight. Meat? - Did I hear that right? - I can not believe. I said we're going to eat meat tonight. We will have a barbecue to celebrate Ernestine's engagement. Oh, guys, what a beautiful fire. - And when do we start cooking? - As soon as the meat arrives. - Aren't you mad at you? - Comes soon. Well, what do you have to do? Shoot him? I told you they were clams. We don't have to shoot him and we don't have to dig him up. Let me take care of it. Sono i Putnam. They'll have a barbecue too. Well, luckily we got there first. Martha, is that the meat that was about to arrive? - You can not. - No? Watch. You just can't. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. - Salutations. - Good evening, colonel. - Are you coming to have a barbecue too? - Yes, but ... Oh sorry. We didn't know. Why don't you use this fire. We go home and cook on the stove. - Oh, absolutely not. - We insist, right? After all, you have a party and, well, we're just family. We only have frankfurters. Come on guys, let's get our things together ... ... and we give way to the colonel. You will do no such thing. You will stay here with us. We will join our efforts, this is what we will do. - Oh no. - I insist. We have enough steaks for everyone, don't we? Oh yes, Colonel. Enough for a regiment. Watch. Well, it's not up to me, it's up to Ann. the greatest. If you don't stay, I won't enjoy a bite. We couldn't do this to you, colonel. True? - Certainly not. - Good. Dai, Martha, balla. - S, Martha, dai. - Dai. I didn't think you were capable. - Look, mom is here. - Mom! - Mom. - What a surprise. You are beautiful. Welcome back, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Welcome back. - Thanks, Tom. Hello, Mrs. Gilbreth. I'm Colonel Putnam, a neighbor of yours. - Good evening. - Why doesn't he join us? Certain. Thank you, colonel. Come and get them, guys! - Smell that steak smell. Come on. - You should see ... Something wrong, mom? No. Perch�? We weren't expecting you until mid-August. I know dear. I finished it all very quickly. Isn't this steak delicious? Anyone want more? Yes, thank you. What a beautiful night. It seems like a great shame. What, mom? Well, Ann, I can also tell you. We will all have to go back to Montclair. I went to the real estate agent. Think you can rent this house for the rest of the summer. So the trip didn't go well? No. They canceled two conferences. And I haven't been able to get any renewed from dad's old contracts. But you and dad always worked together. I think, really, it was him they hired. They think I was only accompanying him. - What are you gonna do, mom? - I don't know, Ann. Back in Montclair, I will write letters to all the companies I know ... ... hoping someone will agree to hire a female engineer. Mom, I may not go back to college. I can skip a year. I can stay home, get a job and help. Well, we don't make drastic plans ahead of time. - Mom. Mother. - S , Frank. Say nothing. I'll tell him in the morning. Mom, Ernestine is not good at singing. - Do you want to help her? - I'll try. We returned to Montclair and faced the problem of making ends meet. We saved money and found solutions with one goal in mind: Keep the family together. Here it is. - Thanks, Albert. - Thanks to you, doctor. Come back soon. If you don't mind, I think my noodles are ready. Lunch, now that there are few people. - Go ahead, Albert. Enjoy your meal. - Thank you Doctor. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Where's the other barber? - Ah, he's ... Went to lunch. Can I do something for you? Well, I was hoping I could talk to Albert, because ... Dan, Fred, stop this now. We have been coming here for many years and he knows us well. Well, what Albert does for you, I will be happy to do it. Even more. They are my brothers and sisters. - All? - No, there are four more. Since we are a big family and we need a lot of cuts every month ... ... don't you think we deserve a special price? I think you deserve a medal. I mean that big families are the support of the nation. This is not the point. The point is: Do you think you can get us a special price? Well... There is a lot of hair here. How do I know they are his brothers and sisters? How do I know if he hasn't collected them on the street to get a discount? Well, I never would! Everyone in Montclair knows the Gilbreth family. Gilbreth? How do you spell that? - GlLBRETH. - Stop that! - First name? - I don't have to get my hair cut. Yes, I noticed that. She is fine like this. He should always wear them like this. You don't look like a barber to me. Ah, Miss Gilbreth. Nice to see you again. - Are you still here, Dr. Grayson? - Doctor? - Are you a doctor? - Don't mind it, Miss Gilbreth. They usually take me as a waiter or street cleaner. - Do you think it would be better with a mustache? - No. Me neither. Goodbye, Gilbreth. Ciao! Well... Oh, Dan. - Hey, come on. - Hurry! Hurry up, for God's sake. Why did it take you so long? - Gee, you've got a lot of bottles. - I still have some, but I can't carry them. There are rags, bones or bottles today Hurry up, guys. Hurry up. There are rags, bones or bottles today Here comes the funny old ragman There are rags, bones or bottles today Rags - Overtake him, Ann, overtake him. - Watch. Same old story always the same Rags Rags There are rags, bones or bottles today Here comes the funny old ragman Rags Rags There are rags, bones or bottles today Same old story always the same - Here you are. - Thank you. Forward. Here's another load. Okay, now. Hurry up. Go well. Keep it up. - Here she comes, Bill. - Runway! Let it slip. Pin. Pin... - Accident? - What? Because, if it wasn't ... Eh, look I break your face. - For real? - Yes. Collectors! - What's going on? - We're making roots beer. - To sell it? - Who wants to sell it? We want to drink it. Do you know how much root beer this family drinks in the summer? - No. - Three cases a week. A total expense of $ 3.60 each week. Impressive. - Oh, signora Gilbreth. - S�, Tom? There is a gentleman who wants to see you. Arrived in a luxury car. Wait in the living room. Thank you. Bill, having emptied that one, puts up last week's lot. And remember, don't touch the chalked ones. - I'm from Tom. - Okay. - What did Tom taste like? - I do not know. But I saw him putting yeast, prunes and sugar in it. It must taste awful. - Good morning. - Ah, good morning, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Is it her husband? - Yes. - I know he was a good man. - Yes, he was a good man. I had come to visit Wilson Tools and Bolts. Wilson has a couple of guys running the factory. They're good. Of course I am. My husband made them. I know it. So I'm here. I have a great opportunity for people like them. Do you know someone you would like to do a favor for? I might need some good men. Indeed, half a dozen. - Oh, well, Mr. ... - Harper. Sam Harper. - Harper Electric? - Right. Well, Mr. Harper, my husband has prepared a lot of people ... ... but they are all well employed. And I'm sure they wouldn't want to quit their jobs. I tried to steal those two boys from Wilson, but nothing to do. Well, they just wouldn't be the best for her. No? No, we prepped Evans and Boyd for Wilson Tools and Bolts. They wouldn't be good for Harper Electric. - We? - YES. My husband and I always worked together. - For real? - I'm an engineer too. Women slip everywhere ... - As? - Oh, nothing. Do you think she ... No, it would never work. - Of course it would work. Why not? - Why not, what? What he is thinking. He will prepare men for her. - Where is it? - Here. My husband and I, we prepared everyone else at home. Ah, it would never work. No worthy man would take instructions from a woman. I will not do it. It is a very narrow and bigoted point of view, Mr. Harper. Maybe it is. But it's my opinion, and I keep it. Yes, have it. If you are heartened, I have discovered that that opinion ... ... is shared by many industries in our country. But there is no reason to get upset. - What can I do if ... - Goodbye, Mr. Harper. Does he give lessons here? No. These are my babies. Children, this is Mr. Harper. - Salutations. - Good morning. Good morning. - Oh, I'm sorry. - And she is another. - Ann, Mr. Harper. - Good morning, Mr. Harper. And he thinks he can train some executives here too, huh? It is my opinion, Mr. Harper, and it seems that I will keep it. Yes, well goodbye. Goodbye, Ann. - Dull, arrogant, headstrong, ignorant ... - Mom, what is it? Oh, that would have been perfect. I could have earned enough by working from home. Enough for all of us to send you to college ... ... and I shouldn't have left the kids. It is maddening to have to face this stupid macho presumption. - I do not understand. - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I don't know what to do anymore. Oh, mom. I know you will find something. A few letters you wrote ... I've already received enough responses to imagine what everyone will say. "Sorry. We have nothing for you." It infuriates me. For a moment I thought all my troubles were over. - Good heavens, what was that? - In the basement. It must be the boiler. Ann, we need to get the kids out of the house before it blows up. The house will not explode, ma'am. There is nothing to be afraid of. - What is it? - Only children's roots beer. Oh, thank goodness. Yes. Don't worry about anything. I am already going to clean everything. Children's Roots Beer? Tom. One minute. Roots beer does not explode. - Alcohol. - Alcohol? Do you smell alcohol, Mrs. Gilbreth? Odor? If I strike a match, it skips the whole house. - What were you doing? - The? Not the children, you. Well, it can be said that it is an old family recipe. Put some plums, some yeast and add sugar, for the flavor. It is possible that with this recipe ... ... create something that reacts chemically like alcohol ... ... and smells of alcohol. - And tastes like alcohol. - Yes. No. Get in there, Tom. Tom, this is too much. I know you have been with us for many years, but this is the climax. I have warned you many times, but now, you leave me no alternative. You just have to go away. I had to do it. I had to send him away. - No come on. - We can't do it without Tom. I know you love him ... ... but you'll have to get by without him. Well come on guys ... ... let's go clean up that mess already. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Yes? I think you should let me in, because I've changed my mind. - For real? - Yes. Oh, entry, entry. Thank you. It can teach. He will send you two boys. - Ah, but two are not enough. - As? I don't want to start classes if I don't have at least six students. Besides, it would be inefficient to teach two, being able to teach six together. And you yourself talked about half a dozen. - That would be so inefficient for you ... - Okay. Call me tomorrow, and we'll make a deal. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Harper. It will. - Nothing. What the hell was that? The children have a workshop downstairs ... ... and I think they're playing with chemists. Chemists? It smells of alcohol. Mr. Harper, alcohol is a chemist. Yes, it is. - Good afternoon. - Goodbye, I'll call you tomorrow. I know she is engaged in work science and engineering ... ... so I wrote my references myself. - I would be very grateful if you signed them. - Did you write the references yourself? Well, I've learned something over the years I've been here. I read it to him. "Dear sirs: Thomas George Bracken worked for me for 20 years ... ... as a cook, cleaner, gardener, stoker, and housekeeper. After 20 years of loyalty and dedication, I sadly had to fire him ... ... due to economic problems for which he was not responsible ". I will absolutely not sign it. I know it's a bit biased, but if let's be honest, who's gonna hire me? Fire you when I need it most. - But, Mrs. Gilbreth, you ... - You picked a good time. Just when I'm about to start school, and you know I need you ... ... and you decide to leave. After 20 years. Never heard of anyone so ungrateful. Yes, ma'am. - Pardon miss. Thank you Madam. - That's better. Mrs. Gilbreth, this is the last. For Thanksgiving the school was in full swing. Sam Harper did more than he promised. Not only did he send four of his men ... ... but convinced a department store in New York to send two more ... ... and persuaded Kincade Gomma to send two more. We must remember that among all the factors of industrial management ... ... the most important is the human factor. Since tomorrow is Thanksgiving ... ... today we finish a little earlier. My eldest daughter comes home from college for the holidays ... ... and this is a very important day in our home. I wish you a happy Thanksgiving day. - Thank you, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Thank you very much. - Guys, what a nice car. - Wow, the latest fashion. - That coat costs a minimum of $ 600. - I do not see it. And that spider, who knows how much he will have paid for it. - Don't try to ask him. - Yes, Ernestine. Rest assured that he will act civilly. If you marry him, none of us will ever have to work. Yes, we will all come and live with you. - Who is it? - Al Lynch, the Nantucket heartthrob. Mom, you said I could invite him for Thanksgiving. Yes, dear, I remember it. Now remember, guys, everybody stand up when he comes in. There he is. - Quick, all seated. - Why? How do we get up if we don't sit down first? - Al Lynch, what a nice surprise. - Girl. - Al, my whole family is here. - Child, what brooch are you wearing? Oh no! Al, please. - No, Al. - Okay. Did you take a look at the carriage? It costs 2000 grand. - The answer you were looking for. - Oh, she's great, Al. - How about a quick ride? - Say hello to my family first. There is time for that. I stay all weekend. - I'll tell Mom. - Certain. Let me meet your old woman. Stay away from me. Mom, I'd like to introduce you to Al Lynch. Al, this is my mother. - Your mother? - "I could have sworn it was your sister." Looks like your sister. I could have sworn. Ernestine, won't you be cold with that open collar? Oh, no problem Mrs. G. If she's cold, I'll give her some of my coat. The sleeves. Well, we'll meet again. And to think we're having a party in his honor tonight. He lends her sleeves. I would like to give him a nice kick in the butt. What daddy would have done. If you don't care about Morton Dykes, why did you invite him? - Why didn't you ask someone else? - I don't care about anyone. Yet. - Hello. - Well, bye. We had a fantastic lap with the spider. - For three hours? - We're out of gas. - Oh, Ernestine! - Didn't you fall into that old trick? - Well, are you ... - Trust me, Ernestine, I'm not jealous. - Not a bit. - For real? - Poor child, you're frozen. - Take a hot bath right away. Fight again for Sagawon Fight, fight, fight Now, do as I told you. You go first, Bill. S�. - Fight for the Gilbreths. - Right. - Hello. - Hello. - Hey, I thought I closed the door. - No, the lock never works. Nobody pays any attention to a thing like that in a big family. You mean one of the girls might come in too? Oh, sure, but they probably wouldn't even look at you. - They'd pass you by. - What? How we were brought up. You weren't polite, you were rude. Very funny. - Hey, close the door. - Sure, but it won't prevent them from entering. Fighting for Sagawon again Ciao. - Are you sure it's out there? - Sure. - I threw it up, and it never came down. - Okay, I'll get it back for you. Hey, what are you doing? There's his ball out there, and I want to catch it from him. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? The only dangerous thing out there is a big black roof. Give me that brush. I don't get there. - Certain. - Hey. Gee, you have chest hair. You have more hair than Tom. He lets me throw them at him. - Go away. - I got it. - Good. - Come on, Fred. - Okay. Thanks so much. - Close the window! Close the door! Oh sorry. Oh, I'm very sorry, dear Al. Your name is Al, right? - Mom, a Paul Jones. - Okay, dear. Guys, Paul Jones. Now, as soon as the music stops, they change partners. I don't want to change partners. Just once. I'm trying to liven up the party. - Have you seen Al? - No. - I wonder what happened to him. - To who? Oh, no, don't go. Excuse me, please. No locks on the doors. People who come and go while one takes a bath. Brothers who dress up as sisters. I thought it was a particular family, but not that you were crazy. That's enough! I don't want to hear anything against my family anymore. If you don't like it, go away. - What do you think I'm doing? - Well, then go. Not without my brooch. I don't want it anyway. Believe me, I just forgot. I don't know how I forgot something so flashy and vulgar ... Al Lynch gets it from whoever he comes from. We are sorry to see you leave. We are sorry to see you leave We really hope that you will never come back and we are sorry to see you leave We are sorry to see you leave. We are sorry to see you leave Oh, Mom, I don't know what they did to him ... ... but they did something terrible. - Who? - I do not know. But, mom, I gave him the brooch back. You did just fine, dear. Go try to have fun. I can't, mom. I just can't. You have to. You have other guests. It will go all the way. He will find out exactly what happened. Tom, you know everything that happens in this house. What happened upstairs? - Who was dressed like your sister? - I knew I was forgetting something. Tom, who was it? I'm not a spy, Mrs. Gilbreth. Frank, would you like to go out for a minute? I want talk with you. Oh, sure mom. Do you have anything to do with what happened to Al Lynch? Well, it took a while, but we did it. - Frank, Al was Ernestine's guest. - Sure mom. This was the problem. It wasn't up to you to judge him. The poor thing has a broken heart. He's crying. He took the brooch back. She is desperate. - Ernestine? - S�. Mom, come here. There is something I want to show you. Now, mom, you have to accept it. From now on, there are certain things ... ... that the men of the family will have to do for you. S�, Frank. THE ENGINEERING CLUB OF AMERICA ASKS THE HONOR OF THE PRESENCE OF DOTT. L.M. GILBRETH AT DINNER WHICH WILL BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 16 AT 7.30 PM. CLUB OF ENGINEERS OF AMERICA NEW YORK Oh, I beg your pardon ma'am, are you Dr. Gilbreth? Yes, it's me. Would you mind waiting here just a moment? - Well, no. - Thank you. ENGINEERING CLUB OF AMERICA Dr. Gilbreth, this is Kendall Williams, chair of the panel of speakers. Good evening. Something wrong? I am terribly sorry. This is very embarrassing. But there was a terrible mistake. You see, one of the rules of the Engineers' Club ... ... it is that women are not allowed to enter. - Oh, you're kidding. - Unfortunately not. I tried to call her at home, but she was already gone. I'm very sorry. Would you mind telling me why I was invited? I read an article by LM Gilbreth, and was very impressed. I thought it would be interesting if Gilbreth showed it to us. But ... but she is a woman. I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Williams. After all, engineering is also limited. This is a copy of the presentation I wanted to do. Perhaps your members will find inspiration there if a man reads it. Good night. Soon. Yes, this is Gilbreth house. I'm Martha Gilbreth. Ospedale Montclair? Mother! But it is impossible. in New York to make a presentation. What happened? Oh. What happened to her? Her mother was in a car accident and was brought here. No, he can't talk to her now. You will be able to visit it tomorrow morning, at 10. Tomorrow morning at 10? Not before? ... are you sure he's okay? - Thank you. - What happened? Mom, ... had a car accident. - It's at Montclair hospital. - Is fine? They said so, but ... I'm calling Ann. I think he should be back from college. If he leaves tonight, he should arrive in the morning. Contact center? Switchboard operator, I want to do a long distance. OSPEDALE MONTCLAIR VISITING HOURS FROM 10:00 TO 11:30 AM CHILDREN UNDER 12 YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED - How long do I have to stay, doctor? - Until it heals. But I have to know. I have my children at home, alone. I have a lesson, I have a lecture at Rutgers next Saturday. I think it would be better to erase everything for a while. - But I can't ... - Mrs. Gilbreth. Bumped into a parked truck ... ... and it doesn't take a doctor to tell her she needs to rest. Forward. - Mom. Oh, mom. - Children. Dear. How nice to see you. - Are you okay, Mom? - I'm fine, dear. How are the other children? You couldn't bring them, were you? No. They won't let them in, but they're fine. - Where's Frank? - Are you okay, doctor? Well, yes, but he has to rest. Very. - The barber. - It is true. Do you know each other? I almost cut everyone's hair, but we didn't agree on the price. Oh really? Well, I'm sending the nurse to take care of the flowers. Thank you. RESERVED TO DOCTORS Street. Come back. Via. - Frank, dear. - I brought all the children. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Lillian. - For you, mom. - Oh, thank you, love. - You're hurt. - Just a little, dear. Just a little. - Does it hurt, mom? - Now don't cry. If the doctor hears you, he'll let you all out. So, Mom. None of you went to school today. You will have to go there directly from here. I should write an excuse for your delay. Don't worry, mom. I have them all here. One original and eight carbon copies. Sign the first one only. I definitely don't have to worry that everything is fine at home, do I? Well, Mom. Oh, another bouquet of flowers. He will have to take another vase. By the way, Dr. Grayson saw you enter. He said to get the little ones out where they came in. Yes, ma'am. And when you come back tomorrow, always use the back stairs. Yes, ma'am. Now, that's enough for today. Better say hello. Tomorrow you can stay longer. - Hello sweetheart. - Hello. Hi dear. Hello sweetheart. Caution. Don't shake the bed. Your mother feels a lot of pain. No, not anymore. Hi, Bill. Hi, Fred, dear. - Ernestine. - Hello Mom. - Hello. - Hi, Ann. Ciao. - Hello Mom. - Hi, Frank. - Hi girls. How is your mother? - The doctor says he'll be fine. - Good. I'm happy. Where is it? - Room 309. Thank you. - Miss Gilbreth. - Ah, say, doctor. I wanted to reassure her about her mother's condition. He just needs a lot of attention, and he'll make sure he gets it. - Thank you Doctor. - I hope you visit it every day. I think it would do you a lot of good. I will not be able. I have to go back to college tomorrow. - But I'm back for the Easter holidays. - Good. Good. - Well, goodbye. - Until we meet again. - Does mom stay until Easter? - Of course not. - Then I don't understand. - Okay, Ernestine. Ann gets it. And when that Kendall Williams left me on the sidewalk ... ... in front of the engineering club ... ... all dressed up and without being able to go to dinner, I got so mad ... ... that maybe I didn't look at the road and hit a parked truck. - And here I am. - That's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Everyone in the country should know that Dr. LM Gilbreth is a woman. An exceptional woman. All she needs is good publicity, and she'll make sure it gets it. Come? Remember when I got to her house and told her to call me Sam Harper ... ... and she said, "Harper Electric's?" - Right? - Yes? So, leave it to me. SPECIAL ATTRACTION FOR EASTER SEE A MONTCLAIR FAMILY in the NEWSPAPER If you ask me out again, I promise we will go alone. There is no problem. an experience. Come on, hurry up folks. The newsreel is about to start. Forward. Not the Gilbreths. They lived on our block. God, how happy my mother was when they left. COOLIDGE BECOMES HEAD OF SIOUX Rosebud Robe, descendant of Sitting Bull, wears the war hat. Dr. Lillian Gilbreth, expert in industrial processes and her family If you think it's not very efficient on Dr. Gilbreth's part ... ... we show you what a dinner is, in a family of this size ... ... if mom is an expert in efficiency. Tom, the faithful servant of the Gilbreths. Look mom, there's Ann. Don't eat the dish. - Good heavens, is it finished? - I think so. And now, for REAL efficiency. Oh, no, it's not finished. Do you realize that newsreel will be around the United States? Canada and the British islands. I insist it is great advertisement. Keep saying it, but how can good publicity be? They said his name, they wrote it, they used his image. And believe me, this is the important thing. Children, your mother is now a public figure. And me too. The first day I go back to school ... I will not go. I'll take something that will force me to bed until June. But what's wrong with you? Do you understand that you are on the same newsreel as the president of the United States? Yes. I thought he was funnier, but no one laughed at him. It doesn't matter if they laughed or not. They will remember it. - Isn't that right, doctor? - Well, it would be hard to forget. We are ships that pass in the night. Yes, east east and west west, and so on and so forth. So is life. You meet people of all kinds. I hope your evening wasn't completely wasted. No I do not think so. Well, see you tomorrow night. But, I forgot to ask you. Are you free tomorrow night? - Yes. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. Arrive on time. He'll be here in a moment. - Bob, please, it's a station. - Precisely. People always kiss in train stations. But I'm not leaving, and neither are you. - Someone might hear you. - Stop that. I'm trying to put you in a good mood ... ... so that you look happy when you tell your mother about us. Bob, I'm thinking I should tell him myself. - Don't make it look too solemn. - No. But think if I burst into tears. I don't wish you were there too. - Do you cry every time you're happy? - Sometimes. You should have seen me when I was graduating. You would have thought they were flirting with me. - Are you coming home at 5:00? - Okay, love. Hello sweetheart. Have a good trip, love. - Mama. - Ann, way. - How did the conference go? - Oh, beautifully. I have some wonderful news. Would you like it if your mother was a teacher? - No. - S�. You are facing Professor Lillian Gilbreth of Purdue University. Purdue? - Well, that's great. - Yes. If it were closer to Montclair. I hate leaving children for a long time. Now that you are home and can take my place, I think it will be fine. Porter, that's mine. The roundabout. Look, don't tell Sam Harper. It would give a lot of air ... ... but, you know, I think that newsreel worked. The principal told me he has never laughed so much in his entire life. But he also read an article of mine last month and saw my lecture. - Taxi, lady? - Yes, please. - Taxi? - The car is broken again. - How are things at home? - Oh, great. - Are you sure? - Well, yes, Mom. - Why should anything go wrong? - I do not know. But when I'm away, I'm always afraid that something bad might happen. - Why, Mom. - I don't know, it's silly. But I'm never sure until I come back and see you all. But now that you're home it won't worry me so much. You don't know what great comfort you give me. Thank you Madam. - Thanks, Ben. - Nothing, doctor. - Hi, Ann. - Hi, Bob. How did it go? I didn't tell him. Bob, do you think this is a good idea? Repeat? Well, get married while you're still doing your internship. Don't you think it would be better if we waited a little bit? No I do not think so. Why do you want to wait? - I told you. - No, you didn't tell me. This afternoon you weren't worried about taking on the world together. Obviously there is another reason. - Alright then. It is unfair to them. - For who? For mom and the whole family. Oh, Bob, don't you understand? I have had all the benefits. Now it's Ernestine's turn to go to college ... ... and someone has to help Mom. I think I have to do it. I mean, we can be engaged, but let's not get married, for a while. - For a while, how long? - I do not know. - One year? Two? - I do not know. I had heard of families like that. This is the first time I've met one. - Families how? - They raise children and then use them. They never leave them free. They turn them into deputy mothers and vice dads ... ... who pay wages, take care of younger children ... - My mother is not like that. - Maybe it isn't. But this is the result, for you and me. Unfair, Ann. - It's unfair. Either you tell him or me. - No, Bob. No. Oh, can't you wait? It won't work. We are too in love. We should get married right away. Look, you know this. So, let me tell you. I can not. Okay. Then you can't. - Please, Bob, I love you. - Okay, okay. Never mind. - Please, Bob. - That's how things are. - You don't even want to go in? - No, I better go back to the hospital. - Call me? - Oh, sure, sure. Oh, guys, the strawberry is good. - What do you taste like? - I'll take the cherry. - I want lemon. - Watch. SALE OF CHARITY AND DANCE HIGH SCHOOL OF MONTCLAIR "Help us create the new gym" COME ALL!

Mrs. Fox can't come tonight ... ... so I got promoted to head of the drinks counter. Well, darling, you volunteered. I offered myself because no boy offered to take me dancing. - Hi, Ann. - Hello Mom. - Andy, is that you? - Yes, it's me. Would you lend me your evening bag for tonight? - Sure, take it. - Nice, thanks. - I thought you were going to the prom. - No, I'm not going. Ann, is everything okay with you and Bob? Well, yes, of course. I don't want to be nosy, dear ... ... but it seems to me that you haven't seen each other for a couple of weeks. Well, he did the nights, at the hospital. Two weeks in a row? A little strange, isn't it? Yes, that's true. I'm understaffed, I guess. Ready? Ready? Yes. Call from New York. Ready? Oh, hello, Morton. I'm Ernestine. I'm fine. And you? Do you want to talk to Ann? ... Well, I can also talk to you. Are you and Ann free tonight? - Both? I mean, me and Ann? - Yes. I know it's at the last minute and it's not appropriate ... ... My cousin just arrived from Atlanta. He will only be staying for a few days, and I was wondering if we could go out together. Morton, there's a dance in town tonight, and it's for a good cause. I promised to go help. Maybe we can all go there. Wait a minute, I ask Ann. Andy, Morton is together with his cousin from Georgia ... ... and they want to take us to the prom. What do you say? Oh, Ern, I don't think so. I do not feel like it. Oh, please, Ann. If you don't come, I'm stuck behind the drinks counter all evening. Please, Ann, do it for me. Oh alright. Why not. Morton, says he'd be happy. See you at 8:00. Gee, I have to do a thousand things. - Ann, are you sure you want to go? - Certain. Why not? Ah, you were supposed to go out with Mr. Harper tonight, right? There is no problem. It's Tom's turn to stay home. - Good evening, Sam. - Good evening. For you, professor. Thank you. You make me feel like I'm going to a dance too. - Is everyone going to the prom? - Well, the older girls and Frank. Why don't we go there too. I'm fine today. Like a child. - Lilly, you look wonderful. - Thank you. Come to the room. I want talk with you. Sit down. You know me. When I have something to say, I say it directly. - Yes? - So... - What I wanted to ask you ... - - Excuse me, Sam. It must be someone looking for girls. - Hi, Morton. - Good evening, Mrs. Gilbreth. This is my cousin, Franklin Dykes. - Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. - Please, come in. - Thank you. I warn the girls that you are here. Oh, there they are. - Hi, Morton. - Good evening, Morton. Hi, Ann. Hi, Ernestine. I want to introduce you to my cousin, Franklin Dykes. Good evening, Miss Ann. Well, I never thought I'd catch someone like you. - Morton, I have to thank you. - But, Franklin ... Forget it, Morton. When you come to Atlanta, I hope I can pay off hospitality in kind. But I doubt it. Here we go? Come on, Morton. - Goodnight Mom. - Goodnight dear. Don't worry, Mrs. Gilbreth. I will take good care of your daughter. - Good night lady. - Good night sir. Good evening. I'm Mr. Beasley. I came to get Martha. - Oh, come in, Mr. Beasley. - Thank you. I call her. Oh, Frank. Do you want to tell Martha that Mr. Beasley is here? - Martha, there's Bubber. - Thank you. - Hi, Bubber. - Hi, Frank. - Mom, the tie. I can not make it. - Yes, dear, I'm trying to fix it for you. Lilly, what's going on? It only takes a minute, Sam. Oh, I'd like to introduce Mr. Beasley. Mr. Harper. Good evening, Mr. Beasley. Good evening everyone. Hi, Bubber. Hi, Martha. It was very kind of you to invite me to the prom. There is no problem. Frank brings my little sister there. Come on, let's go. - Goodbye Sir. - Goodbye, Mr. Beasley. - Goodbye, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Goodbye, Mr. Beasley. - Thanks Mom. Goodbye to everyone. - Bye dear. Was that Martha? Yes. She rehearsed to this day so as not to look like an old maid. - Would you like to sit down, please, Lilly? - Yes, Sam. You know, Lilly, I'm pretty well financially, and I have a lot of power ... ... but there is only one thing that motivates me these days. Is there no one else in the house who can open the door? No, Sam. I'm not very well economically. - Good evening, Mrs. Gilbreth. - Good evening, Bob. Could I see Ann, please? I'm sorry. Exit. With Ernestine. - Do you mind if I wait? - Of course, but it will take a while. Aspetter�. - You know Mr. Harper. - Certain. Hello, Mr. Harper. Oh, hello. Stay here? - So why don't we go out? - No I do not think so. Thanks anyway. - Are you worried, Bob? - What? He asked if you are worried. Oh, no. No. Sorry, but I have so many worries. - I understand. - For real? I'm leaving for Detroit. That assignment at Detroit General Hospital? Yes. Went ahead, and I must leave immediately. Tonight. So I wanted to see Ann. Yes, but Ann went dancing. Will not return ... To dance? She said she had gone out with Ernestine. It was a date for four. He only did it to allow Ernestine to have a chaperone. Ah, so now help Ernestine. Well, last time I spoke to her, she had to help her. I suppose in a year's time he'll have to help Martha or Frank or somebody else. - Will she ever do anything for herself? - What are you talking about? Ridiculous. It's just ridiculous. I came to tell her it's okay, she'll wait for you. But I'm going silly. This is not a family. Most families only have two hands to hold you back. This is an octopus, which holds you back with all its tentacles. Maybe Ann wants to waste her life, but I don't. Goodbye, Mrs. Gilbreth. Goodbye, Mr. Harper. What was it about? I don't know, but I have a rough idea. Bakery sweets You know, Miss Ann, my mother always wanted a big family too ... ... but he only had me. - I hope they don't interrupt us anymore. - Me too. When Frank said he was bringing my sister here, if I was bringing you ... ... I thought it was going to be a terrible night. - But it's not. magnificent. - It's great for me too, Bubber. Until tonight I had always wanted to be a kid. - Thank you. - Thanks, Morton. If you don't mind, I'd like to sit down. Oh sure. - Can I get you some punch? - No thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please be careful. Now we will have the first event of our dance competition: The shag. Choose your companions for the shag contest. - Ann, would you like ... - Come on, Ann. I'll teach you how it's done in Georgia. - Do you want to participate in the race? - No, thanks, Morton. I'd make you lose. Are you sure you don't want to? Well, that's fine. The worst that can happen is that they eliminate us. Eliminate us? You know, I think we could win this race. - Really, Morton? - Certain. See how we go. - Frank. - Oh, Mom. What are you doing here? - Where's Ann? - on the dance floor. - I'll go get her, Lilly. - He can't. He's doing the race. A race? But I have to talk to her. Wait, I think one of the judges is about to take her out. - Oh, God. - One minute, Lilly. Thank you. Ann, your mother wants to talk to you. near the drinks counter. Thank you. This is the first dance contest I lose in my life. You were doing the southern version. It is prohibited in New Jersey. - What happen? - Come out, Ann. I have to talk to you. - I have a message from Bob for you. - Called? No, he came and told me to tell you he's leaving for Detroit tonight. He received that assignment. Oh, no. Will you please tell me what happened between you two? What is this story, that you told him you have to wait? Why do you have to wait? And why is the Gilbreth family an octopus? - Did Bob say that? - Yes. Well, Mom, you have a wonderful opportunity to go to Purdue ... ... and I should stay at home to give others the same opportunities as me. And how long do you think it takes? I do not know. A year or two. Why not 15 or even 20? At that time, Jane may have been married. Or maybe he will decide never to get married ... ... you will both be old maids and you will always live with me. Why have we kept this family together? To have spinster daughters around the house? for this? No. - a question or an answer? - I do not know. Well, I tell you. What I worked for, what I hoped for and what I prayed for ... ... is that someone like Bob would love you and marry you. Oh, Mom! Now, go to the hospital and stop him before he leaves. - Bob! - Listen, you two. I don't go to Detroit alone. He won't let Ann sacrifice herself. He'll have to find a way to go on without her. I can not. - You can not? - That's right, I can't. Well what are you waiting for? Here she is. Take it. Everything will be fine, Sam. Well, that's all right. Now, Lilly ... Mrs. Gilbreth, have you seen Ann? I've been looking for it everywhere. I have terrible news for you, boy. Just left for Detroit. Detroit? Ma � in Michigan. Here is someone who knows geography. Lilly, let's find a quiet place. There is something I want to tell you. Ladies and gentlemen, choose your partner for the waltz competition. Oh, Sam, I'd like to dance. We participate. Okay, if you want. - You danced beautifully. - Oh, my feet. And I felt like a kid when I came to see you tonight. Lilly, do you have many days like this? All time. Intense life. You don't have much time for other things, do you? No, Sam, I think not. - Well, we're there. - Yes. - Oh, you don't have to go out, Sam. - Thanks, Lilly. Oh, Lilly. Keep this memory of Sam Harper ... ... the guy you won a dance contest with. Thanks, Sam. Thanks for everything. Mamma mia, are the kids in the chemical lab at this hour? I do not know. I better go and see. - Good night, Sam. - Good night, Lilly, good night. - Home, Mr. Harper? - Yes, please. - Tom. - I followed the recipe this time. Tom, you are just incorrigible. Janey. - Did that noise wake you up? - No. - Well, then why are you crying? - I just want a glass of water. Signorina Jane Gilbreth. - Congratulations, Jane. - Thank you. You are great, I have to say. You work hard all your life to send your kids to college ... ... and when the big final moment comes, you fall asleep. I wasn't sleeping, dear. I was just thinking of someone who loved all of us very much ... ... and I thanked him.
