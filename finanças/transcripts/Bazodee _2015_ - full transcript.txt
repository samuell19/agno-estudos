Oh, God. If this is your airport look, I"d hate to see what you're doing for the engagement party. I don"t want him to forget what he"s been missing. Poorvi, some lip gloss. No. Partiv"s going to be there. That"s nice. They let the non-achieving branch of the Kumar family tree come along for the ride? He"s not like the rest of them. He is his own man. Come on. You look so beautiful. I"m sure you'll knock his socks off. Come along, let"s go. Mr. Panchouri, you need to sign these. Oh, no, Gopal, not now. We"re getting late, and we can"t afford that. Glencoe. Sande Grande. Arima. Toco. No, thank you. Your size good, We ain"t 'fraid to small up. We going off-route, dread. All right, boss, next time? Yes. What did you say to that guy? I told him while we don"t mind squeezing into his vehicle, our stop"s off the beaten path, which means he"d have difficulty getting a return fare. He"ll be mayor in a week, your brother. You just have to do your pre-travel research. They"ve sent a limo. You cannot stop here. Well, if you did your job, officer and moved these cars along, I wouldn"t need to stay here, would I? Listen, don"t get smart, just move the jeep. Right, I"m not afraid to give a nice car ticket, you know. Don"t worry, officer, be happy. Papa, Papa, don"t stress. I"ll go get them. Wow. I love that song. How you know all them words? Played it, like, a million times. Yeah, right. Why"s that funny? "Cause I wrote it. You wrote "Gyal Wuk"? Lee de Leon. Mr. Gyal Wuk at your service. Anita Panchouri. I love your music. Where have you been? I don"t really do music no more. I took a break from that. A break? You make happy music. The world needs that. Believe me. I gotta go. It was nice meeting you. This is not your car! You"re cutting it fine arriving on the day of the party. Well, I did bring a peace offering for staying away so long. So... Beautiful. You"re forgiven. Good, how are you? Hi. Papa, you look great. Lokesh, my old friend. Welcome to Trinidad and Tobago. Such a pleasure to come back and see you, eh? And my humble home is yours. Just a minute, I"ve had an idea. Can I show you what Papa"s been building? I know you"re really tired. Splendid idea. Come along, it"s on the way. Easy. All right, partner, who say I don"t come through for you? I got you the best one. Concrete pourer number one. Nice. You"re starting tomorrow. All right? And a good thing you ain"t playing no more "cause a guy lost his finger in an accident last week. What? Don"t worry. Tell me about London. London. London. Here we are. This is the first of 28 stand-alone structures in my resort of 180 units. Studios, one-bedrooms, luxury suites, a great gym, a pool. Prime beachfront. Seventy-four acres of land, surrounded by sea on all three sides. Means the spa can have fresh fruit and juices from its very own orchard. That, too. How did you secure all this then? I went to the owners one by one, and I cobbled it together. Took him five years. By the end of the year, half these units will be open and so will the Revive Spa. Caribbean Airlines is already asking about their package deals for London flights. It"s the heaviest flight load. Impressive. Location specific. Yeah. It"s beautiful. The photos don"t do it justice. As always, Ram, an eye for an opportunity. Finally, it"s all coming together. Come, let"s go. Hey, what"s her name? Forget her. Tell me about her. Stop playing that, man, tell me the names, stats. Remember, I"m a married man, so tell me everything. Bud, it"s pictures I took, not an inventory. Man, you"ve been living your life in London, playing with all the big pop stars. Backup rhythm guitar on a few acoustic covers. Guesting on all the big tracks. Cut from all the album versions. You"re right, who needs it, uh? You"re gonna love construction anyway. Yeah, but... I been thinking. Dread, it"s Carnival. It would be crazy not to take a shot. Shot? Nah, nah, nah. You said you were done. You said to shoot you if you sing another song. Hey, de Leon, you reach back. You done know. Yes, man. Big brother. Yeah. You know, he and Cynthia, they are... Break up. And getting back together. You leave spies? It"s always the same news. Hey, watch. Invite me up. And what"s your news? Eh, Bud, your boy is back. Who would take you back now? You"ve been away for so long. We could cut a few demos. Demos cost money. I ain"t hear talk about money yet. So book some gigs. Yeah, but nobody hires musicians anymore. There"s only DJ work now. I find this on the board. This? This has been all around town, some guy looking for a set of musicians. Plus, must be skilled in tabla and sitar. Not a problem. Since when you play sitar? Brother, I play life. Just book it. All right, boss. Namaste. Proceed this way. Sita, I haven"t seen you since the ballet in Delhi. Welcome, welcome. Come and join the party. Poru, you look fantastic. So good to see you. Welcome, welcome. Always a pleasure. Hey, Rakshan! Hey. Hey. That"s an awfully small sitar. I play sitar on the ukulele. Yeah? Yeah, I been doing this for some time now in England. Really? Mmm-hmm, I just echo what you play. Yeah... echo. Excuse me. No. I say we pack up and leave! Oh, my gosh, you look gorgeous. Just putting her best foot forward. When young Kumar see her tonight, for sure the hook going all the way in. He will set that date one time. Haha! Looks like we don"t need our passion fruit anymore. We need you downstairs. Oh, my God. Sweeter, hotter. Uncle is stressing about the roti skins or something. Oh, really? God, your father will drive me crazy. I am gonna have a little pow-wow with Poorvi. Child, you need to put some clothes on. Come along. What? No, I have things to do. It"s an engagement party. You have to dress a little better. It won"t take a minute. I"ve got plans for you, Missy. Oh, my God! Anita you look amazing. Jasmine, two minutes, two minutes. Papa, is everything okay? Oh, yes... fine. They"re just bluffing. They want me to make a higher offer. But I won"t. You know why? Business 101. They are here with all their musicians, technicians, in front of the cream of Trinidad society. They"re not just gonna walk away, are they? Papa, I think... Go, go! They will rue the day. Don"t worry, everything is gonna be okay. I"ll play. Oh, uh, you a professional musician? Absolutely, sir. And, uh, your band? Me, and me alone. You and your... Ukulele. Ukulele, right. Sanjay, bring my CD collection, please. Papa, let him play. He"s good. How do you know? I"ve heard him. Come on, I"m not gonna ruin the party. Okay, I trust you, my darling. Sanjay, show our musician friend where he can set up with his, uh, ukulele. Come this way, sir. Ah, Mr. Panchouri. Oh, hey! Hi. Hi. You"re um... Partiv. The other brother. Right and you are... The blogger. Poorvi"s coming. Say something nice. What do I even say? Tell her she looks beautiful. Poorvi, you look... Ridiculous, I know. Anita painted me up like drywall, hmm. Okay. Landa. I"m going to get a drink. It"s a free bar. Still playing matchmaker? And failing miserably. Congrats. I never thought you"d be my sister-in-law. But you made the right choice. I did. Whoo! Thank you. At least the drinks are priceless, even if the jury"s out on the entertainment. Strange Ram sent the musicians home. Is there some sort of local strike? I"d like to strike them with my fist. He"s Ram Panchouri. He"s the reason half of them have houses. Yes, of course. I"m Jasmine. Nikhil Kumar. You"re the other brother. Indeed. It was nice meeting you. Oh, my God, this is ridiculous. Who gets married in a palace? A princess. When all this is over and we"re back in London, it"ll be breakfast in bed, morning jogs, and evening strolls. Just the two of us. Yeah? You"ve got to dump India Steel. I don"t care what they"re telling you. They"re in a slide and their internals aren"t good. However, there is an engineering firm out of Bangalore we"ll want to take a look at. Did you notice he let go the first set of musicians? It"s odd to be changing plans mid-stream, don"t you think? Ram can be eccentric. Chaotic more like it. It"s taken them three hours to set up one buffet table. They just want to make the best impression. Nikhil, they"re doing a great job hosting this. Let"s not spoil it. Do you think we should take our seats? I"m just gonna have a little bit of a stroll around. I"ll see you then. Poorvi, I think you should sit next to Partiv. Anita, stop. Partiv is, like, a very sweet, very lost big brother. I live in the real world, and in the real world, he gets motion sickness from a tire swing. Let"s face it, he"d be the first one voted off the island. Let"s go. He wouldn"t. I hope he doesn"t sing about weed. I hope he does sing about weed. And share some, too. Ooh. That one guy is doing all the music? He better be good. Dad"s a stickler for music now that he"s a season sponsor of the Bristol Philharmonic. Where"s Nikhil? Friends... may I have your attention, please? This celebration tonight is to welcome the Kumars from London with our famous Trinidadian hospitality. And, and with these words of wisdom: Nobody teaches the volcano how to erupt. Nobody teaches the tsunami how to sweep everything before it. No one teaches the hurricane how to wreak havoc. No one teaches a man how to find a wife. Nobody teaches a woman how to find love. Natural disasters just happen. Let the music begin. Here we go! Well, this one is about uniting the nation! Why can"t we all get along? You have to work, even while the big party"s going on. There were a few pressing emails I needed to attend to. Vertical gardens. Tea lounges, steam rooms. The largest hamam in the entire Caribbean. Oh, Mr. Panchouri has thought of everything. It"s amazing that Ram is able to manage his cashflow during the construction phase, before the revenue starts coming in. There will be advances in place. Yes, of course. Anita mentioned that. Mr. Panchouri is a visionary. Very wise man. Well, do come join us. Of course I will. See you in a bit. Enjoy. That was great! Come here, you. Fantastic show, uh? Thank you. Not too bad yourself. Oh, you"re teasing. You were amazing. Good, right? I don"t know how much encouragement I wanna give a stalker. Stalker? You"re the one singing all my songs all the time. How did you find me? Fate and a flyer. I was singing the song in my room. How did you know? Listen, I just followed your lead. Followed my lead? What? Anyway, why"s your dad having this big party? Oh, my God. Hello, we need to talk about your man, okay? So, I was finally able to pry him away from the aunties. And I am sorry, he is amazing. I"m so jealous of you. You have the perfect engagement party, perfect husband, perfect ring. I"ll tell you all about it. Lee, you were fantastic. Thank you. You must meet my friend, Vijay. He"s been organizing some fantastic concerts here lately. Lee, I remember you, another big hit. Went to London, disappear. Bud still managing you? Still with Bud, man. Have a drink, catch up on old times. Tell ya everything would have been perfect. Everybody talking about how it"s the best engagement party they ever went to. They like the food, they like the decorations. And everybody saying you look so nice. Except Nadia. I see her watching you. You know, she want to look like you for her wedding. I"ll tell you a story about her later. And I didn"t know Mr. Lokesh could dance like that. Hey, I saw that my dad hooked you up with Vijay. Amazing. I got a gig Sunday night. He has the perfect venue. You"re gonna be amazing. Whatcha looking at? That is my fiancee"s brother. I"ve been trying to hook him up with my cousin forever. Just get them in a romantic place. Where? Like a island. We"re already on an island. Like a desert island. You know, shipwreck, two of them alone. How am I supposed to do that? Get them to Pigeon Point. I can"t get these people to the cinema. How am I supposed to get them to Pigeon Point? Listen, I have a cousin named Soul Boy who rents boats in Pigeon Point. Okay, but what if I can"t get the two of them both out there together? You got me back into music. This is way easier than that. Congrats, by the way. I didn"t know you's getting married. I am. You make a great couple. So, friends? Friendship. Thank you. I"m turning in. That was some party. Your dad must"ve invested a lot in it. Papa doesn"t think about money when it comes to this kind of thing. My dad doesn"t either. That"s what you and I have in common. We have to protect our fathers. Good night. Good night. So, what"s on the agenda for tomorrow? Let"s go paddleboarding. You want to go paddleboarding? I don"t care what we do. As long as we"re together. You make it hard to respect the house rules. But I don"t want your father thinking I take you for granted because, well, you know. I"m a good girl? You"re a good woman. I love you. Good night. Good night. We had an amazing night tonight, Ma. And don"t worry, I"m looking after Papa. That"s fantastic. Really, really great, yeah. Yeah, so I"ll call you tomorrow. Great, yeah, bless. I just finished dealing with that fella Vijay I set you up with. You set me up with? Also got studio time for you. So, when we finish eat, we"re going over there. Seen. Seen. Wait, wait. Scratch that. It"ll have to be another day. What do you mean, Lee? Carnival ain"t waiting for you, you know. It"s either you're in or you"re out. Yeah, but I promised somebody I"d do something. Well, un-promise it. I can"t. It"s a woman promise. She"s a friend, and I owe her. Look, let me just do this one thing for her and we"ll be even. Be even? Lee? Lee! You didn"t even finish your food. Okay, I"m off. Don"t forget to update the pictures to the website. I"ll do it as soon as I finish this package for young Mr. Kumar. Nikhil? Uh, yes. We had a chat last night. He seems very interested in the spa resort. I"d prefer if you don't talk to him about that. But he"s our guest. I know, but I think he might be involved with other developers and digging for information. I don"t want anyone stealing Papa"s great ideas. Of course, but do you really think... Gopal, please. No more private meetings. We need to keep everything on track. Okay. Come on, we"re gonna miss the boat. Which one you prefer? This one or this one? You already have a bag. Come on, we"re gonna miss the boat. Look at the sea of boats. Gorgeous islands. Yes. We can paddle all the way out there. All right. This is how we"re doing this. You and you. You and you. And you and you. Uh, I"d really prefer not to be paired with someone. Hear now, partner. Science does not care what you prefer. Science is a calculation of weight and distribution. Would you like to drown today, brother? No, sir. Thought not. That leaves you and me. All right, everybody, let"s head out. I have no idea, either. I don"t know. Which side do you want? Oh, no, no, no, not this boat. That boat, all right? But they look the same. He"s still doing the fashion retailing, but he"s just got into bed sheets and high-quality... I don"t wanna bore you folks. Nonsense, we need to know about each other"s work. It might be a good partnership with the spa. Oh, I"m sure there's all kinds of, you know, synergies between our businesses. Now, if only Partiv could get started on something. By the way, where is Partiv anyway? Well, I have a feeling that they"re gonna be back any minute now. Now, this one on the other hand... Tell Ram how in a single visit to Gujarat last March, you were able to get all the textile plants together in one go and double the output of his London product, eh. Actually came from something Anita said. Really? I"m just gonna go for a walk, okay? You okay? Yeah, I"m fine. I can join you. I"ll just be a minute. Okay. Hey. Hey. So, how"s the plan going? Come see for yourself. Amazing. Yeah? Let me see. Let me see, let me see. Oh, my God, now they"re not even talking to each other. What? I didn"t know you were gonna sink their boat. Don"t panic. It"s up to us to add the magic ingredients, stir in a little love. How are supposed to do that? We improvise. Look. That"s sophisticated. There you are. You didn"t happen to see Poorvi or Partiv anywhere, did you? Everyone"s starting to get worried. You okay? Yeah. Should we head back? Mmm-hmmm. What"s up? Here you are, my man. Look, a boat can"t just disappear. Okay. Really starting to think they killed each other. I"m getting quite worried. I think we should look for them. Look at that. Oh, my God. I think I"ve had too much to drink. Or maybe, it"s just an old fashioned sunstroke. You little schemer. You set this up. Have another card? You are a goddess of love, you know that? Uh... must be a mistake. Run it again. Declined. Ran it twice. Um... Here, take this one. Lokesh, I can"t let you. You"re my guest. Hey, Ram, we"re family now. It"s okay. - But... - It"s okay. You"ve been checking your phone all evening. Any update on India Steel? Dad, you respect my advice. Sure. You"re better than my best financial guys. Then listen to me. This is the beginning of them living off what we"ve built. Nikhil, his card didn"t go through, these things happen. It"s a bad investment. They"re a bad investment. Look, you"re not gonna get very far in life only seeing the worst in people. Okay? My old friend is fine. Lee, about what happened... It"s okay. No, it"s just... The music, I get carried away. That song you heard me singing last night, my mom used to sing that. Your mom? She died when I was six. Sorry. But I know what that could feel like. My dad left us and I couldn"t deal with it. Then I found music. Yeah, you can get lost in music. Yeah. The whole world is black and white, and then, boom! You"re singing out loud. And everything"s in color. Yeah. It makes me feel... Bazodee. Like you wake up and you have no idea where you are. That"s how I felt when I heard you singing upstairs in that room. But it"s not real. Yeah. Exactly. I"m sorry. It was wrong. Don"t worry, gone. Forgotten, "kay? You are never gonna believe it. From Rambagh Palace. They"ve had a cancellation. Our full fee"s already in. We can have the entire palace. In three weeks? I can be there. Let"s do it. Guys, this isn"t up to you. It"s up to her. Anita, everyone who needs to be there will be there. It can be just like we always dreamed. What do you say? Yes. Dads, we"re getting married. Fantastic! Let"s book our tickets to magical Jaipur. Come along. Papa, we don"t have the money for this. We can always borrow against the house. It"ll be all right. Let"s go! It looks gorgeous on you. Look as though you"re getting ready for a funeral. Feel like I"m going to a funeral. You don"t write like it. This is the one you been working on, right? You"re performing this tonight? You have three verses of new music that you don"t want to sing? Lee, whoever this woman is, she"s your muse, dread. She"s inspired you to be amazing. You don"t just shut the door on that. I"m looking for Lee. Oh, there you are, hey. Looking sharp. Thank you. How you feeling? Really good. Vijay. Hi. Nikhil. Vijay. This is a very impressive set-up. I"d love to learn more about it. Sure, anytime. Ram has my number. Let"s meet up, have some drinks, talk about it. Excellent. Big crowd out there. Big expectations. You"re gonna rock it. Gonna soak them with some soca. I"m sure you will. - Don"t let me down. - Enjoy. Hey, Vijay. How you doing? Thanks, thanks, man. Ram, see, took your advice. Show time! Show time! Come on, come on! Let"s go! Vijay, Lee, time to leave. Let"s go. Get up, get up, get up! Let"s go, show time! Thank you. Hey, remember what you said at the airport? What? You told me my music make people happy. Well, tonight, I"m gonna do it. I"m gonna make everybody happy. 800,000 women on this island and you had to choose the one with the biggest rock on her finger. Introducing to you, the man to shut it down, the one, the only, Lee de Leon! Ay, you! Come here! Congrats, man. Lee was amazing. We have to go and congratulate him. No, not now. He"s going to be surrounded by fans. Let"s go sit at the bar. Lokesh, come. We have to go. I just knew it! Knew it! He definitely didn"t let us down. Excuse me. Sorry, guys. Anita! Meet me tonight. This is madness. This is Carnival. Go. Go. Come on, Anita. You can get lost in a place like this. You need to do a better job looking after your bride. I will. I"ll never let you go again. Come on. Hi, Lee. Totally lovely show. It was so good. You were amazing. May I have your autograph? What does it say? Sorry, Miss Anita, didn"t mean to wake you. Take me with you. What? Take me with you. Your father would kill me. It have all kind of rough men and vagabonds out. This is my last chance. I hope this don"t have anything to do with that soca boy you know. Come on. Show me how you party. Tonight is about us. Mr. Kumar. You are needing some help, sir? No. Just getting a spot of fresh air. Well, um, I just have to deliver my peppers here now, eh? Of course. Peppers wait for no man. That"s right. Bharat, wake up! Driver, you need to go faster. No worries, man. Hey, Nikki, I appreciate a midnight run as much as the next guy, but this is a ridiculous waste of my time. You"ll see. She"s playing you. Stop worrying about the time. I have to keep track. You have nowhere else to be. No Partiv and Poorvi to fix, no daddy to please. You know everything about me, and I know nothing about you. Well, stay and you can ask me anything. Okay. Where"s your family? You said I could ask you anything. I never knew my dad. And my mom, she"s a nurse Miami. I was raised by my granny in deep south. A country boy. Granny teach us everything, even to play the guitar. She used to play for us every Sunday in Sunday school. You? Sunday school? Haul your ass. I was a choir boy. How does a choir boy wind up singing soca? She used to play all her records every day except Sunday. Kitchener was her boy. Every time he win a crown she would run out in the street and ring this bell she had. Like if she win the crown. I wanna make people feel like doing that. I wanna write the songs that make people feel like doing that. You"re doing it. "Cause of you. You"re obsessed with her. What do you think she"s stealing off to do in the middle of the night? How do you know she"s not at home? Because she"s not in her room. I checked. There are 14 rooms in that house. Trust me, okay? She"s not out buying a wedding sari. Isn"t that Vijay? Young Mr. Kumar, I didn"t know you wanted to come Carnival. You should"ve told me to wait for you. I"m going home. Wait. It"s crazy, really. I mean, can you believe it? Me, dancing and drinking at a soca fete. I don"t do these things. Oh, my God! And Partiv is talking about us moving in together. We can be together in London. You and me in the city of Shakespeare. Will and Kate, Big Ben. It"ll be amazing. We could team up. I could do custom remodeling, you could sell. We"re gonna be unstoppable. Cup of tea, anyone? Looking for something, Mr. Nikhil? Just hoping to find a stapler. Have you got one? There is one on the desk right in front of you. Silly me. Now you have got to leave. I must insist. Whatever competitor you"re working for will have to come up with your own ideas. Mr. Panchouri"s vision is completely confidential. What on earth are you talking about? I suppose it"s that horrible Club Caribe corporation. They have wanted that land forever to build their God-awful timeshares. Club Caribe? So, I"ve guessed correctly? Correctly? No. Perfectly. Absolutely perfectly. Tonight, Ariapita Avenue. I"m taking you. You have to tell him something. He don"t even know you"re going. There"s nothing to tell, it"s over. You can lie, but your face can"t. Go and tell him the truth. The truth is that I made a mistake, and I need to fix it. You don"t have to marry Bharat. You want me to fail Papa? And have everyone say he climbed higher than he should have? Don"t nobody care about that kind of thing. They say they don"t, but they do. When I"m Mrs. Kumar, no one will ever say that about him again. But Lee"s out there thinking... He will get drunk and get back on the music truck. No, he won"t. He"ll come looking for you. He can"t come here. He"ll come and then you"ll have to tell him to his face. What if it never happened? You can"t change that. Yes, I can. All he knows about what I feel is what I tell him. Miss Anita, I don"t think you understand what you"re doing. You"re lying about love and it"s your future you"re talking about. Lalima, don"t you have any other work? Dad. What? I want you to forget everything I said about Ram"s project. Good, because apparently, he needs a little more capitalization to get to the finish line. I think you should do a bit more than capitalization here. You said it was a terrible investment. The property itself is the tangible asset. The rest has some risk associated with it, which is why you need to maintain power of execution. Am I to be the majority investor? Trust me, Dad. I"ll draw up the deal memo, you hand it to Ram. Everyone will be pleased and protected. Don"t make it one of those one-sided, take-no-prisoners agreements. Why would I do that? It"s just a simple deal memo to define the parameters so that there are no misunderstandings down the road. We all trust each other. We"re family now. Hello? Anita. Anita. I think about you all day. Can"t wait to see you. I can"t come. What do you mean you"re not coming? It was a mistake. Babe, stop doubting yourself. In what world can you and I ever be together? Anita. There was a bet. A bet? A bet to hook up with a black man. Stop making this up. Anita! I"m sorry. Ani... Brilliant. Thank you, Vijay. Yeah. Has Anita seen this agreement? The idea for the two families to collaborate on this project was actually hers. Of course. In any case, this is all a formality. If one can"t trust family, who can one trust? Here you go. Thank you. Okay, here we are. Okay, Anita, so we had to travel halfway across the country, because everything"s shut for Carnival, but I went to the distributor, and I managed to get you a caseload of that frangipani soap you love so much so we can take it home with us. Thank you. Time to get ready for a big, fat Indian Wedding. Shall we go? One last piece of business. Are we going to include this photo on the invites? Say this is a lie. This can"t be true. You betrayed us?! What is this? At least we get a great deal of out it to ease the pain. Deal? What deal? What deal? The land, the resort, the spa... I"ve signed it all over to them. Now, because of some stupid fling, we"ve lost everything. You signed over everything? Everything. Even this house and everything in it. I"m finished because of you. Shame on you. This... this is... This is all... this is all wrong. It"s okay. Please. It was just a lapse in judgment. On my part. The ring. I hope you"re happy when he has you dirt poor, run to ruin in some country shack. Let"s go, Nikhil. Um, phone, please. You"ve ruined everything. Technically, you did by being a lying whore. Do you know why I never went out with you? Despite the begging, pleading, weeping phone calls? That was nothing. It was just a stupid little crush. You have been stalking, creeping, digging around. What for? Are you happy now? Yes, actually. That"s interesting "cause you're the only one in your family who can"t build anything. You earn points. You pay people to be your friends and they still hate you. Everyone around you despises you. Why is that, Nikhil? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Give me the strongest thing you"ve got. Make it a double. It"ll work out. Somehow, they"ll work it out. You know your dad always finds a way. Yeah, I guess not. But at least now you can go after the person you really love. That"s the important thing. Right? Yeah. That"s the important thing. Your phone? Blend it. What? Put this phone in that blender and make me a drink. Please. Serious? Partner, you riding with me. I"m not waiting an extra day because of him. We need to check in right now. Come on, we can"t leave him. It"s just not like him. He"s never been late for a flight in his life. Oh, my God. Well, he certainly knows how to make up for lost time. You can"t do this. This is honest black man work. I only said that because we needed to stop and I didn"t know what else to say. I didn"t mean it! So, what parts did you mean? And what parts was bullshit? Nothing was bullshit. You can"t stop your music. Oh, so you want me to smile with white bright teeth? And play happy steel drum for your rich friends? I want the opposite and you know that. And what Anita wants, Anita gets, right? What I want? I only wanted to help my father and ended up making him lose everything. His house, his dreams his money, it"s all gone. That"s what I got. You got nothing? Well, at least one thing turned out right. Mmm-hmmm. Amazon? Yes. Venues by licensed people? Fancy lights he wanted. Hi. Hi. Hi. Just give me one minute. Hey, look, last time you walked in, I lost my job. I lost my artist. I lost my friend. What happened? Why isn"t he performing? You"re asking me why he"s not performing? I mean, you... Hold on. Yeah, Mark. Yes, of course, we still want the lights. Just not the ones that break down after the first set. Yeah, LED lights. Moving heads. Yeah, all right, okay, thanks. LED. Expensive ones. Expensive ones. And up the budget. Higher up the budget. Higher. Higher... no, wait. You know, the ones with the turning heads. But the moving hea... Stop touching things. I don"t want your bad juju. Not you, Mark. Okay. Great, thanks. We have to get him back in the game. We don"t. We have a show to do. You can take your bad lucky self and go home. Look, we"re very busy here. Please. The lights? Budget. What about his grandmother? He"d listen to her. He would... if she were alive. Look, Lee, the body dead. And there"s no one that can change that. Not even me. Okay, thanks. Hmmm, that was sudden. Lee grandmother dying. Share my condolences. I have two words for you. "Night out." Jas, that is not my thing anymore. Come on, it"s been four months. Maybe when Poorvi gets back for Carnival. You haven"t even looked at the invite. You"ve got to be kidding. You"re inviting me to the Club Caribe groundbreaking? They hired me to do their PR. And I need help. And you"re the person that I want. Well, I"m not working for the corporate demons the Kumars sold us out to. Well, forget them. Come to get back in the game. Meet people. Stop wasting all your incredible conversational skills on plants. You know, you should go. Otherwise, they"ll think they"ve won. They did win. Really? What do you really miss? The gardens? The servants? Two big dining tables? Hmmm? What? I know, you miss... the boy. I did this awful thing, Papa, and... it can never be undone. Nothing can be undone making sandwiches for your papa. It doesn"t really matter who"s gonna be there. What do you have to lose? You, too? You guys need to stop. What, you"re gonna sit and suffer? I deserve it. For putting your father first? For putting me and Partiv first? Making us happier than we ever thought we could be? What about Bharat? Bharat got caught up in a storm. It happens. I see him, he"s okay. Are you? After ruining two generations of friendship? Anita, still worrying about everyone else, eh? Look, I"m in London, job of my life, man who loves me, and sometimes I feel like it"s a dream. But it didn"t just happen. You made that happen. You did it. Now go and do something for yourself now. It"s not that simple. Just think about it, okay? Hey. Got your "message." Couldn"t argue with that. Hello. Listen, that was pretty sneaky of you. It"s called "determined." Okay, then. Well, for the second time, thanks for getting me back into music. I just wanted to say that. I would do it a thousand times if I had to. I"ll always do it. I believe in you. Listen, I just... Don"t. Don"t say anything. Yeah, I was never that good with words anyway. If I wanna say something I"ll say it... With a song. Exactly. Okay. Anita. Anita. What are you doing here? I came to a groundbreaking. Nikhil, I feel bad enough. I don"t need this humiliation. Anita, wait. Just, Bharat... Just listen to me for Bharat"s sake. You said things to me that no one has ever said. You asked me if I was happy. I wasn"t. Look, it wasn"t easy, but I persuaded my dad to buy out Club Caribe and just so that we could partner with its rightful owners. So, how"s about this: Your papa"s resort, as run by me and you, but we have to be honest with each other. Fifty-fifty all the way. Why should I trust you? Everyone makes mistakes. Cheer up. At least for the party. All your friends are here. I don"t understand. Haha! What a wonderful happening! Papa, this is amazing! Amazing? It"s terrible! How can we have a party without music? The kind of music that you love! Hey, you! Come here!
