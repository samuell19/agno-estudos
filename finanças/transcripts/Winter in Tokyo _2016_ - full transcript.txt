I don't know how many hundreds of books I have read and how many hundreds of stories are absorbed in my mind. The stories about the characters in the books. Meanwhile, my own story has just begun. No, not here. I'm waiting for Kazuto here. Kazuto who appeared a few pages before this. He showed up one night, when winter had just begun. Keiko! Hurry up! It's very cold! Did you have dinner already? -Yes. What about you? -Yeah. -We have a new neighbor. -Right across from you. Room 201. You met the person? No. He told us about it. After we left for work this morning, the neighbor got to the apartment. He took the key and never left the room until we left for dinner. -A man or woman? -A man. Let's go. You wanted to hurry. It's very cold. Quickly. -See you later. -See you. See you later, Keiko. I am so sorry. Are you all right? I didn't know there was someone at the door. Keiko! I was about to go to buy some food. She got hit by the door and fell. I thought something happened. This is Saito Tomoyuki. And this is his sister, Haruka. And this is your neighbor. Yes. He is our new tenant. Nice meeting you all. Excuse me. Can you put the broom down? I thought there was a burglar. What were you doing, Keiko? Taking a peek? How dare you. I just wanted to make sure he's fine. You said he didn't leave the room all day. I was afraid he fainted inside… -Keiko, you read too many books. -Porn books. I'm sorry. Don't listen to him. No problem. Thank you for your concern. Okay, then. Let's go back downstairs. Kazuto, welcome to our apartment. -Are you sure you're all right? -Yes. Okay. I'm going to buy some food. Excuse me. All right. He is the first page of my story. Nishimura Kazuto. Excuse me. Where is Keiko? Keiko is over there. Thank you. You're welcome. Excuse me. Kazuto? Are you busy? Kazuto was born in Japan and moved to New York when he was in junior high school. He is a street photographer who captures life in the city streets. And to get close to him doesn't take dozens of book pages. Good morning. Kazuto! You've been here for two weeks. What took you so long to see me? Your mom called me every night. And I didn't know what to tell her about you. How are you, Kazuto? -You're doing well, aren't you? -I'm very well, Uncle. -I'm just busy right now. -Busy with what now? Busy adapting to Tokyo once again. You're such a smooth talker. I'm sorry, Uncle. But I have to go now. I have an appointment with a friend. -You're leaving already? -You have my number. You can call me anytime. But please don't tell my mom for now. Let me call her myself. Hold on, Kazuto. Where do you live now? You know I have plenty of apartments in Tokyo. If you want, you can choose one. Thank you very much. But I have rented an apartment. I'm going now. Good afternoon. Excuse me. Are you the famous Naomi? No, I'm not. -Good afternoon. -Hi, good afternoon. -Who was that? -Oh, that. She thought I was Naomi. It happens all the time. -Naomi? -Yes. My twin sister. Now she works and lives in London. So your father is in Kyoto, your mom is in Jakarta, you're in Tokyo and -your twin sister's in London? -Yes. No. My mom is not in Jakarta. She's from Jakarta. She's Indonesian. So, where are we going now? Kazuto. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was going to rain. Don't worry. It's all right. Akira! Keiko, what's the matter? My heart stops every time I hear the name "Akira". Aren't there millions of men named Akira in Japan? -That's right… -So? Which Akira were you talking about? My first love, when I was in sixth grade. Hold on. How old are you now? It happened centuries ago, Keiko. What's with the pout? Okay, I apologize. You don't understand. -About what? -Love. Oh, my God, Keiko! Is there anyone in the world who really understands love? Let's go. I still don't know nor have the courage to ask why he came back to Tokyo, alone, after living for so long in New York. By the way, I can cook, you know? Really? That means tonight you will cook for me, right? We'll see. Your apartment is actually quite big. Unlike my apartment. -I guess you're right. -Yeah. Why don't you like egg? I don't know. I've never liked it since I was a kid. It's delicious. I'm good at cooking, aren't I? Some people are destined to be here today, but feel like they've been here for years. That's what I feel about Kazuto. He's just been here. But I feel like I've known him long before today. Hello. Why are you calling? You forgot your Hello Kitty slippers. I left them on purpose. So next time I go there, I don't have to go back home to get my slippers. As if you live far from here. You're also calling as if you live far away. I'm too lazy to walk there, I'm too full. Thank you for cooking for me, Keiko. Sure. You're welcome. -Good night. -Good night. Good morning! -Morning, Keiko. -Morning. Your boyfriend is not coming today? My boyfriend? Nishimura. You mean Kazuto? He's not my boyfriend. If he's not your boyfriend, then what is he to you? Kazuto! Long time no see. Since when are you in Tokyo? You forgot? It's me. Akira! It's been a long time! How are you? I'm good. -And you? -I'm good. Too bad I have to go. House visit to one of my patients. You're a doctor? Yes. That's cool! We should catch up sometime. Here's my business card. Thank you. -Good evening. -Evening. Kazuto! Silly me. I only brought one umbrella. Go back home then. Get one more umbrella. It's all right. Let's hope it fits us. Although you eat a lot, you're tiny. Okay, then. Let's go home. It's freezing. Come on. So cold. Do you know? In Jakarta, they have what they call "ojek payung". -"Ojek payung"? -Yes. What is that? They let people use their umbrella for money. Oh, so you want me to pay you? Okay, let me hold the umbrella. So you'll pay me instead. -Let's go. -Okay. The light bulb in my living room doesn't work. I don't like the dark and I can't sleep in the dark. What is the relation? The broken bulb is in the living room, not your bedroom. I don't like to see the dark room. Especially if I get thirsty at night and have to go to the kitchen. Like it or not, I have to go through the dark living room. Okay, I will try and change it later. -You can do that? -Of course. Let's say that will be the payment for your "ojek payung" service. Deal? In my story, every sentence mentioning the rain that night is underlined with a bright-colored marker. The bulb looks okay. It's the electrical connection that's broken. It needs to be fixed by an electrician. Call them tomorrow. Where are you going? Going back to my apartment, of course. Do you mind if I wait in your apartment until I get really sleepy? I don't see any of your photos in your apartment. I don't have time. Later, when I have another exhibition. Besides, I prefer to see the photos in my laptop nowadays. How sad. Photos have to be printed to be enjoyed. -That's the art of the photography. -Yeah. Do you know a good place to print photos? Keiko, you keep sneezing. Go see a doctor. This is cold season. I know. But don't bring the disease to the library. You might contaminate the books there with your virus. All right. I will go to the doctor later. I'm sorry. Are you okay? It hurts so much. Let me take a look. I haven't registered yet. I came here because of a cold. We'll take care of that too in my office. Okay. Done. Now I will examine your cold. Your heart beats really fast. Now open your mouth. I will prescribe you an ointment for your ankle. And medicine to take for your cold. The cold is not too bad. What's your name? Me? Ishida Keiko. You are… Kitano Akira. I mean Dr. Kitano Akira. Yes. We went to the same school. -Same school? -You remember, right? My elementary and your junior high school were in the same building. I remember that school. That super big school. But they have thousands of students there. -Sorry. I can't remember every… -I was your junior. Your memory is amazing. Because you helped me once. Sometimes, the main character in a book doesn't show up on the first page. They can show up in the quarter or in the middle of the story. You guys go ahead. What's going on? I'm looking for my necklace, but I can't find it. I'll help you find it. Is your name Keiko? Yes. I've found it. Thank you. It's all right. Stop crying. Don't lose it again. Keiko. Have you found the necklace? The headmaster wants to see us. Wait, Naomi. You see those junior high school boys? What's the matter? Do you know the name of the boy with the blue wool hat? You know the names of all the junior high students. That's Kitano Akira. For Kitano Akira, he existed long before the first word of my story was written. I told you. Who would remember such small things? It's not a small thing. Not a small thing? The only person who can fall in love from those kind of things is you. You even call it "first love". That's hilarious. So be it. But we've exchanged numbers. -Congratulations! -Don't give up! Be careful. Smells like Akira. I totally forgot. What time is the invitation? Let me get ready, okay? Take your time. This is Grandma Ozawa's tradition to invite us for dinner once a month. I'm sorry. I… That girl is Yuri. And the guy's name is Jason. We've been friends since we were kids when I was in New York. I fell in love with Yuri. But unfortunately she didn't love me. She chose Jason over me and they're planning to get married. So that's the reason you moved back to Tokyo? Is there anything more foolish than leaving because of heartbreak? Okay, it's all right. Everybody has their own way to mend their broken heart. -Let's go. -Yeah. What's wrong with your legs? I fell at the hospital. I wanted to get cold medicine but got a sprained ankle as a bonus. Let me help you, okay? Slowly. Heavy. I am not that heavy. It means you are heavy. Are you saying that I'm fat? Don't talk. Did you supervise the electrician who fixed the lamp in my living room? Yes. Everything is fixed now. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, right. Tonight, before you sleep, please turn off the light in your room. Why? I'm afraid of the dark. Keiko, why should you be scared of the dark… when there are many beautiful things that can be only seen in the dark? After you, please. I'm coming. Turns out that he's eight years older than me. I have to go to Kyoto early on the 25th. Haruka and I have to be at our parents' by the 23rd. Right? What about your plan, Kazuto? I don't have any plan yet. No plan? That's too bad, to be alone on Christmas Eve. The Love Doctor is calling. Excuse me, I have to take this call. Hello. Haruka. Love Doctor? Today, at the hospital, Keiko met her first love and he's a doctor now. -Hello. -Hello. Are you getting ready to sleep now? Just about to. What's up? Turn off the light in your room. Turn off the light in my room? You know I can't sleep in the dark. No harm in trying though. Kazuto! What have you done to my ceiling? -You don't like it? -I love it! -Thank you. -Yeah. What's the name of your Love Doctor? Kitano Akira. -We should catch up sometimes. -Okay. Here's my business card. -Good night. -Night. All right, then. Have a good rest. I asked myself that night. Has Kazuto ever done anything this beautiful for Yuri? And will Akira do the same for me? Come on, Keiko! Come on! -The wind is so strong. -Yeah. Where do you want to eat tonight? My favorite restaurant is over there. You want to try it? One minute, please. Hello. Okay. What's going on? I'm sorry, Keiko. I have to go back to the hospital. Is something wrong? There's an emergency. -All right. -Let's go. We've been on several dates, but he always get calls from the hospital. Because he's a doctor. If he's a sumo wrestler, then the hospital calls would be weird. Silly. Kazuto. Why are you so quiet? I am focusing on my coffee. Keiko, look! Swan Lake! Keiko's favorite. I have to check their website. -Come on. -I'm coming. Kazuto? I'll get you for this. Keiko, you're here. Your lips are bleeding. It's okay. -What's going on? -We just got back after dinner. And that guy showed up. He looked drunk and tried to approach me. -I wanted to help, but he was bigger. -Stop with your excuses. Fortunately Kazuto is here. All right. Let's go home. Aren't you supposed to be on a date with Akira? As usual. He got an emergency call from the hospital. What's up? I thought you were sleeping already. For your wound. Thank you. Are you still disappointed with the failed date? Actually, I'm not too disappointed because… Akira has bought two Swan Lake tickets for our date. Okay. Don't forget to treat the wound. -Good night. -Good night. Kazuto. I'm really happy. You finally decided to come with me to Kobe. Good morning. Morning? It's almost noon. Kazuto? I've been messaging and calling you. How could you? My phone was not off. It was broken when I reached Kobe. It's working now. Kobe? Are you in Kobe? Yeah. My uncle asked me to go with him to visit my grandpa's grave here. And to celebrate Christmas, too. Besides, Kobe is not too far from Tokyo. Keiko, why are you quiet? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sure you're busy preparing for your date tonight anyway. Are you still going to watch Swan Lake? Akira suddenly has to cover for a doctor tonight. Our date is canceled… again. Kazuto? Kazuto! You said you were in Kobe! My uncle has plenty of friends in Kobe. So I better be here to cheer up someone who needs a friend. Such a sweet talker. -Do you like it? -Yeah. All right. Go and get ready now. We're spending this Christmas Eve outside. -Yes! -Yes. Please get in. How did you get this table without reservation? With luck. Do you know? In this restaurant, every Valentine, there's always one or more men proposing to their girlfriends. Isn't that romantic? And I really want someday… I can witness that moment. Now, choose what to eat, we have 1.5 hours to finish the food. After that we will catch the show. The show? Cool! -Swan Lake! How did you… -Keiko. Calm down. Let's go. Slowly. Come on, try. -I'm scared. -Don't be. Just do it slowly. Here. Let me hold your hand. -Don't let me go. -Keiko, I will never let you go. Let me know when you get there. Yes. When will you come back? On the 29th. I will pick you up, okay? Okay. -Keiko. -Yes? May I know something? What is it? How can Akira be your first love? You haven't explained it to me in detail. You will consider me silly. You know I've done something silly too by leaving New York. When I was in elementary school, a friend of mine grabbed my necklace and threw it out the window. Then I ran to look for it in the snowy yard while crying. Then he came and helped me look for my necklace. I asked Naomi the name of that boy. She told me that boy is Kitano Akira. I never saw him again after that… until that day, when I met him at the hospital few weeks ago. Oh, right. Hold on. Speaking of necklace, I wear it only when I go back to Kyoto. Do you think you can let Akira go? Why? Later. Your train is here. We'll talk after you're back from Kyoto. See you later. See you. What's going on here? Are you serious? You've forgotten about me? We have unfinished business! And I get to this page. I don't know how many more pages my story will continue for. And I don't know if the previous pages have any value. Or you can just skip those pages without thoroughly reading them. Sorry. It's been two days but he's still in critical condition. We still can't predict when he'll wake up from his coma. -Here you go. -Thank you. Since you left for Kyoto, I haven't seen him again. I called his number but his phone was off. I messaged him but he didn't reply. Maybe he's on vacation alone. You miss him, don't you? I'm just curious. We have an unfinished conversation. Please drink. Kazuto was found unconscious next to a car that he borrowed from me a day before. The police still haven't found the guys who did it. Kazuto! Uncle? When did you arrive in New York? Yuri? Doctor, what's actually happening to Kazuto? He's having partial amnesia due to the beating. He can't remember anything that happened in the past month. But don't worry, he has passed the critical period. I feel bad for my school mate. He's got amnesia because he was hit in the head. I took a picture with him. You want to see? -Yes. -Hold on. Can we go home now? I'm really tired. Okay. Let's go. Come on in. Kazuto, welcome to your new apartment. Yuri and I came here earlier and we tidied up everything. Your wardrobe is upstairs and it's filled already. Thank you very much. I promised your mom. Come on. Let's go upstairs. It's not New Year yet in New York. Happy New Year. May we still be friends this year. What's wrong? I… I miss Naomi. It's okay if you want to cry. Why are you here, really? From the third of January, there will be an international workshop in Tokyo. So your main purpose is not me? When your Mom told me about your condition, I called my agency right away and accepted it. What's the last thing that you remember? New York. And you. This is my hotel. The workshop will be located a couple of blocks from here. -All right then. I'll go ahead. -Yeah. Do you know? In the beginning of the year, like now… the library is usually deserted. The people are either still on holiday or… they're just lazy. Unlike hospitals that are always crowded. But the weird thing is… why are you here with me instead? Or is the hospital deserted, too? There's something I want to ask you. What? I have a junior high reunion this Saturday. My batch. And? Will you come with me? You don't have to answer now. -You can check your schedule and… -Yes. I'm there. -What do you mean? -I meant, yes. I will accompany you to your junior high reunion. Thank you. You're welcome. Would you like to drink? Akira? You're here. Masaki. Long time no see! Guess who else is coming here. Who? That's Taka. Taka! Let's go there. -Keiko, hold on for a second. -Okay. Taka, long time no see. Ryu, it's been a while! -How are you? -I'm good. -You, Kazuto? -I'm good. -I need to go to the toilet. -Okay. Where have you been? You disappeared without a word! Me? What's your excuse now? Why did you disappear? -Me? -Yes! Answer me! Excuse me. -Answer me! -Keiko. He… He's my neighbor in my apartment. Everyone's almost gone crazy looking for him. Is she your girlfriend? Keiko, he's the friend I told you about. The one who got beaten up and has partial amnesia. He can't remember anything that happened in the past month. Do you know him? Do you know me? Kazuto! The toilet is crowded. I was in a very long queue. What's going on here? Meet my friend. I'm Yuri. My name is Akira. He's the doctor who's treating me. And she's his girlfriend. She said she lived in the same apartment with me before the incident. I really feel sorry for Kazuto. So, he will come here tomorrow? Yes. I will make you some more tea. I'll go back to my room now. -Good night. -Good night. So how are your feeling now? I'm really sad to see Kazuto like that. On the other hand, turns out Akira and Kazuto are best friends and… And? He got back together with his old flame. So… I guess I'll never know what you were going to say at the station that day. And my story with Kazuto ended… without never even starting. The main character suddenly got lost somewhere between those lines of words. Please come in. Whose slippers are these? -I don't know. -I'll just use them, okay? I think they look too small for you. This apartment is much smaller than the one Kazuto's living in now. -But it's is much better than… -Tomoyuki. It's my camera. I want to live here again. -Are you sure? -Yes. I'll go to my uncle's apartment now to get my stuff. -Okay. I'll go with you. -Yeah. -Can I wait here? -Yes. Let's go. I'm going now. We have things to do. Let's go. All of your organs are working well. The lab result came out good. Except for my brain. Ever since we met, I'm the one who keeps getting in trouble. You mean I must get health problems too? No. I was talking about your life. My life is fine, Kazuto. And? But my grandfather's birthday is two days away. And the whole family will be there. I want to take Keiko and introduce her to my family. But she said she needed time to think. For her, meeting my family is a big step in our relationship. I feel like I'm going to die waiting for her answer. -Hey. -Keiko. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's okay. I've ordered for you. Thank you. -Let's eat. -Enjoy. I don't like egg. I've never liked it since I was a kid. I'm sorry I didn't know. You want to order something different? It's all right. I can still eat some parts. Do I know that you don't like egg? I think you do. Here. Let me help you separate the egg. What took you so long to get here? I walked slowly. I thought you spent the night at Yuri's place. Yuri and I are only friends. But you love her. So… I told you about Yuri? Yes. I don't share personal things to just anybody unless they're close to me. Were we close? Sort of. Nishimura. Long time no see. I bet you're here for Keiko. How do you know? Kazuto? What if we eat at the usual place? -The usual place? -Yes. You like eating, huh? You, too. What else do you know about me? Keiko, can you come to the bus shelter? I don't have an umbrella. Keiko, why don't you come to my apartment. I'm too lazy to go to your place. And one more thing. I will print the photos later. I can still see them in my laptop. A slacker. I'm not a slacker. -Yes, you are. -No, I am not, Keiko. -You are a slacker. -No. You promised to have lunch with me. I've waited for you at the workshop. Did you forget? Yeah. I wanted to tell and ask you to come to… What's the name of our usual restaurant? I lost my appetite. Kazuto, go after her. Please, go after her. Yuri, I apologize. I'm really sorry. You don't need to cry. Are you that disappointed in me? I am not marrying Jason anymore. -Uncle Shinzo. -Kazuto. Please forgive me, I've just remembered about this place now. What about this restaurant? I own this restaurant. You should remember if you've been to this place. I should. Sit down. That night was Christmas Eve. One day before the incident that happened to you. We were still in Kobe. You asked me a favor to book a table here, the best one. You were going to have dinner with a girl. I hope that girl can help you restore your memory for the past one month you've lived in Tokyo. I'm not sure if it still matters. Kazuto, this girl must have been really special to you. But who is that girl? Do you know her name, Uncle? Unfortunately, none of the waiters here know her name. But they told me this girl looks identical to Naomi. Naomi? The famous photo model in Japan. Now she lives in London. Wait. This is Naomi. Excuse me. I'm sorry, Uncle. I have to go now. Okay. Excuse me. Yuri, what's the matter? I will go back to New York soon. Will you come with me? Gosh, Yuri. I thought it was something important. This is important to me. Your answer is important to me. Kazuto. I can't answer you now. Yuri asked me to go back to New York with her. I'm confused. I should've said yes to her right away. Don't I love her? Go to New York. You do love her. I feel like… we've been in this situation many times before. What situation? Having conversations in front of our doors. You… should stop trying to remember what had happened… and focus on what will happen. Keiko, what do you think will happen? You will be with Yuri. And… you will become the happiest man in the world. Thank you. And you should accept Akira's invitation to introduce you to his family. Akira told me about it. And one more thing. Wait a moment. Please try them on. They fit. These are my slippers. All right, then. Good night. Keiko, I will never let you go. One thing's for sure, I don't have a reason to stay here any longer. What I know is, not everything in this world should have a reason. Thank you for everything. Give my regards to everybody. Goodbye. I think I will wear my casual clothes. No. You will meet Akira's family. Pick the most beautiful clothes. Here. This is good. These are good too. Hold on. Valentine is around the corner. The stores will soon decorate their places with pink color. I don't understand. What's so special about Valentine? It's just like any other day. Do you know? Many men wait for Valentine's Day to confess their love to their women. I think it's ridiculous to wait for a certain day to say "I love you". We'll park the car here and walk to my grandfather's house, okay? You brought your umbrella, right? Let's go. Wait! Keiko, what's the matter? I'm afraid of the dark. What? You don't know that I'm scared of the dark, right? And you don't know that I don't like egg. You never understood me. I'm sorry. I can't go and meet your parents. -You don't understand. -About what? -Love. -Oh, my God, Keiko. Is there anyone in the world who really understands love? -Why don't you like egg? -I've never liked it since I was a kid. -Don't let go. -I will never let you go. Keiko. Kazuto? You're not going? I'm sorry, Yuri. I can't go to New York with you. Kazuto. What is it? This is your reason to stay here. I'm sorry I've been hiding it from you. I'm sorry. Aren't you supposed to be with Akira's family? Why? I'm just doing what you've asked me to. Even though I don't know the reason why you asked me to do that. Because you've never finished your sentence. Which sentence? When you took me to the train station. You asked me to let Akira go. For now, maybe I can't remember everything that has happened between us. But I remember the feeling. The feeling every time I'm with you… every time I think of you… that feeling is the one that makes me stay in Tokyo… and forget about New York. I really don't want to cry in front of others. And you don't like the dark? Keiko. I care about you. Kazuto once asked me, "Is there anyone in this world who really understands love?" From hundreds of books that I've read, I realized… I haven't found any words that make me understand love. Because, love should not be understood, it should be felt. Is your name Keiko? Yes. I've found it. Thank you. It's all right. Stop crying. Don't lose it again. Kazuto, nice hat. Akira, if you like it, you can have it. Just like we understand the snow when it falls on our head… eventually I will know… the first page of my story belongs to dozens of winters ago. IN MEMORIAM SUPRAPTO SUMARIYONO
