Experiments in the extension of life. Street children were the preferred target. You were part of a hormone restriction program which essentially comprised of limiting the production of certain hormones. Hormones responsible for deep emotion. Now your body has adapted to function without these hormones, to the extent that, when they're reintroduced, they become toxic, which is what you are now experiencing.
