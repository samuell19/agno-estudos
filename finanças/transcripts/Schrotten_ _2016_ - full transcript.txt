Whenever I try to get away from my family, they pull me in deeper. It was always like that. It's almost a tradition. That's Karl Talhammer, my great-grandfather. He drove his family across the country and started dealing with scrap. That's Emil Talhammer, my grandpa. As the eldest son, he continued his father's scrap trade. Those were the golden years. That's Fiete Talhammer, my father. Scrap dealer, of course. Everything's done his way. Letscho, my little brother, a scrapper through and through. He'd do anything to please our father. But he never can. On the truck! - The tracks, Letscho! - Fuck, yeah! Fiete always expected me to take over. Everything alright? - Go! Better dead than a slave! Drive, Letscho! Fuck, what happened? Shit! But I wanted something else. Something respectable. There was no way I was going back. Mrs. Taft, good morning. Glad I could reach you so early. Mr. Jordan, hello. Mirko Talhammer here from the E&B Insurance Agency... Mrs. Pfl√ºger, God be with you. Talhammer speaking. I still can't forget your cake last week. Mr. Frick? Good morning. - Mrs. Vogt? - Mr. Sanders? Good morning. Mirko Talhammer, E&B Insurance Agency. I'm calling about the third-party liability. Talhammer here. Mirko, exactly. I've reconsidered. I think we need to insure you. It happened overnight, she was on the streets. With her kids. Yes, terrible. These things happen, Mr. Sanders. My friend built a similar house frame. On the last day a worker fell from the scaffold and was incapacitated. We have to protect you. Good decision! Wait a second. It's me again. This is a win-win situation. I understand. Mr. Rudolf, let me think aloud here: How about we insure you and you pay no premiums? No, you get 50 euros a month from my commission on top. For twelve months. But you can't cancel before it expires or I'd have to repay my commission. A good decision. A... I'm happy too. Goodbye, Mr. Rudolf. Going great. You're off the job for a while. - Excuse me? 100,000 euros. We have to repay 100,000 euros to the insurance company because of you. What have I always told you? Only buy as many customers as you can pay with your commission. It's a pyramid scheme. It has to pay for itself. Shit. - In two weeks, our annual report will be published. Get the money by then. And make sure no more of your customers cancel. I can do that. You can do that. Of course, Mirko. Because if you don't, you'll lose everything here. Holy shit. Is Mirko here? Talhammer. I'll be right back. Nice to see you! - Are you crazy? Leave right now. You have to come home. - It's about Fiete. Are you kidding? If Fiete wants something, he can come himself. And don't talk argot with me. We're here to pick you up. - Go away. Take off! SCRAPPIN' Man, Smitty. That headbutt was uncalled-for. You saw how aggressively he said, "Take off! Yes, I did. A washing machine. - Oh, Dreamy. Smitty, let me out. Stop the truck, man. Stop it! What is this shit? Are you nuts? Hello, Mirko. Luzi. I'm old Heiner's daughter. When you left, I was like this... Luzi. Nice. Tell the old man I have nothing to discuss with him. Talhammer here. I need a taxi to Tannhorstweg 63. Yes, immediately. What? Your father is dead. The funeral is tomorrow morning. You're sleeping in his office. The house is already full with family. Who's that? Hi, Letscho. Dreamy, when will they be ready? - Almost done. What have we got? Sausages. - The gherkins, Dad. Join the others. Are we gonna continue? Exactly, Letscho. Are we gonna continue? Of course: better dead than a slave, right? Mirko has changed quite a bit. He didn't even want to come. Smitty had to convince him first. - He's still got Fiete's stare. He's here to get his share. - He's here because Fiete wanted him here. Fiete hated Mirko. Everyone hates Mirko. He should fuck off. I'll be gone before you can sell off the next rain gutter. Letscho. No worries. Is he a dickhead? I'll hold the fort, Dad. The Kerchers won't get us. You can rely on us. We're the last free yard here. They can't drive us out. A Talhammer doesn't get pushed. A Talhammer does the pushing! E&B INSURANCE Show a little respect for your old man. Hey, you fucking Talhammers! Daddy can run, huh? Rocco? - His uncle bought up all the local junkyards. Fuck you, dude. - Fiete is the only one who didn't sell. Rocco's uncle? Wolfgang Kercher? Still the same stress. Your father wanted you to have this. He told me. Maybe you'll come back. You guys do your thing. I'll do mine. Alright, bye. So I wasn't imagining things. Mirko Talhammer. Jumping back into the family business? I'm jumping on the next train, you'll never see me again. Do that, Mirko. In case you want to sell. These are hard times. What are you doing here? I thought you were doing your own thing. Mr. VIP. I want to talk. What's on the gentleman's mind? Just the two of us. - This is family. What do you have to say? - Fine... We're both Fiete's sons and want the best for his yard. I have reasonable ideas about what to do with his legacy. What does he want? - Here. So I understand you correctly: you want the best for our yard. Come on, go home. Go home. Half of it belongs to me, you can't throw me out. Oh, it now belongs to our educated friend. Should we ask for your permission to be here? Ask him for permission. - What's so funny? Hit him, Letscho! 100 on Mirko, Grandpa. Hit him, hit him. - 20 on Letscho. Come on, come on. What's wrong? I won't fight. I won't fight. You better go, OK? This isn't over. Glad you're here, Mirko. Ages ago, I made your father a good offer for his decrepit yard, a much too high offer. But Fiete refused, though they've been bankrupt for so long. But those illiterates don't understand that. Old Fiete was in denial. It's big business here. The warehouse alone is as big as Fiete's whole yard. Here: zinc, copper and nickel, meticulously separated. Boss, the blue container's going out. Goddammit. That blue container's going nowhere. It's that one. Look at the numbers, not the colors. We only ship what's correctly labeled. Everything has its destination. Those who win at the horse, own the city. Those were wild times back then. How much, Wolle? - Let's say 100,000. 50,000 for each. Right. We both know the land alone is worth more than twice that. 200,000. 100,000 for the others, they won't sell for less, and 100,000 for me. Plus 20,000 commission right now. In cash. That's still a bargain, Wolfgang. Commission, huh? Not bad, Mirko. Not bad. You'll get the rest when your brother has signed. Nowadays, there's no more cash on the spot. 20,000, exactly. Right, so nobody else jumps ship. The rest will come in a few days. I got some inheritance. Of course it'll work. Yeah, good. Shit. Talhammer! Now let's talk about the sale. Men, we have to manage without him, yeah? Over there? - Over there on three. Three. OK, boys, the rails have to line up to the tracks. Fine. Fragile! - Now another tie. It won't hold, forget it. We need another tie. - It'll sink, Letscho. We have to do it right. Come on. Let's go. - Here. What are you doing here? I said I want to talk to you. I don't even want to know what you were doing. - It's none of your business. Letscho, I know what the yard means to you. We grew up there together. I'm still one of you. Let's see it then. - What? Go get us the gold, the children are hungry. Very funny. Very funny, Letscho. You wanna tell me about scrappin', yeah? I just want to help you. - Help us? Man, you're a ghost for 15 years, then you want to help us? Man, we are the junkyard. You want to sell our home? You're in too deep, think about it. You'll be swallowed up sooner or later anyway. Why not get a few bucks out of the yard? I could get 100,000. For each of us. Get out of my car. Man, I said get out! Listen, buddy. We can do this another way. It's my legal share, I don't have to help you. You listen, buddy. Know the difference between you and us? We fight when things get shitty, we don't take off. We had a family meeting last night. We'll buy you out. How will you buy me out? None of your business. In a week you'll have your cash.-A week? We're getting a delivery next week and can buy you out. What kind of delivery? In one week. If you say so. I'll be back in a week. If you can't buy me out, we sell. No discussion. I wasn't mistaken! Man, oh, man! You still drive my baby? You look good. Come here. Rambo. - You still know me, Mirko? You're a big shot in the big city or what? My sincere condolences. Thanks, Rambo. I have to go. - Sure, always on the move. Say, why are you still here? For "that thing?" How are you all gonna do it? I mean without Fiete. One sec. What? Hey. I'm talking over there! No manners, these city slaves. I think it's great you're helping them out. I mean hey, Letscho is a fine guy, but that's a big gig for him. Wait, Rambo. What are we talking about? Right, this is a test. Understood. My lips are sealed. Thanks, take care. - Rock it. Why does Rambo Weiler approach me about something we're going to do? Listen, OK? You take care of your shit, we'll take care of ours. What now? We won't pay for metal chips with sand. - Listen, slut. Give me my money or... That fucking whore just broke my nose. Man! - Get out! Luzi, it's important that this "delivery" works out. I won't leave empty-handed. I'll stay here a bit. Kercher controls everything around here. Except for us. We're a hard nut to crack. What do you want, Dreamy? Here. Your album. Italia '90. I saved it for you. Fiete was always waiting for you to come home. Luzi. What? Is this your delivery next week? There's money here. Suitable for theft. Were you snooping around? - Are you robbing a train? None of your business. Fiete wanted us to pick you up. To help you rob a train? - Not a train. A wagon. What? - 40 tons of copper. I guessed the "delivery" was manhole covers, something you know about, 1000 of them, for fuck's sake! My livelihood depends on this. Your livelihood? We're risking everything. A train? - A wagon. You guys are totally, that's... you're completely... Here. Fucking moronic hillbilly scrappers. Disabled, mongoloid, dim-witted, uneducated motherfuckers. They're nuts. Rob a train! Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit. Right. I'm in. Great. In on what? Fiete gave this to Mirko. Why would Fiete give him the plan? He knew stealing 40 tons of copper is more than stealing a gutter. We don't need your help. - P = F/A. Contact pressure, for example. What? P = F/A. The formula for contact pressure, the reason your tracks sink in. Shut up. Eighth grade physics. That's annoying. Here. Thanks. So here's the plan. On Sunday night, a freight train's taking 230,000 euros worth of the city's copper from Kercher's recycling yard to Rotterdam. - Kercher? You're stealing Kercher's copper? - Kercher, the city, it's all the same now. Listen. After the city, the train takes a long bend in the forest. Here. At the end of the bend, we cut a ground cable, which triggers the red light. The train stops and waits until the marshals come to free up the route again. And you take the wagon. - Right. We unhitch the wagon, and hide it on our self-made tracks in the woods. Fiete planned everything exactly. Nothing can go wrong. Shit! That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. Why not steal it right from Kercher's yard? - Too many Kerchers there. This is the only moment when no one's watching the copper. We need to hide the container before the marshals come. If there's no alarm, the train will continue to Rotterdam without the copper and nobody will notice. In the meantime, we shred it and sell it to customers legally, and we're in the clear. Sure. Tour of the romantic medieval town? I'd love to be rid of the yard myself, Wolfgang, but I need another week. So you've gotten sentimental with the family? Get back to business. I'll contact you. Isn't it annoying to be on top of each other all day long? Every day? Morning. - Morning. What happened? - Nothin'. Kamelle? - Nothin'. Kerchers? Well? What happened yesterday? Stealing rails? Man, oh, man, Letscho. That's way too dangerous. Ask Fiete. Don't talk about my father, jerk-off. You won't get us. You'll see! Kercher shouldn't piss me off. Yesterday, you tell me about your great plan and then you provoke the guy you're robbing? Dude! You even lose in win-win situations. - Calm down, Mirko. What a guy. Fuck you. Fuck yourself. No wonder Fiete didn't trust you. Yes, sir! Get him, Letscho. 100 on Mirko. Go, get him! Sock him! I told you he's aggressive. - Yes, you did. Hit him! - Do it! Keep going! - Stand up! Enough, let go. - You first. On three, OK? - On three. One, two, three. Shit, I don't trust you. - We let go on three. OK, on three. One, two, three. Contact pressure, right? 40 tons of copper. 230,000 euros. 90,000 for you. 100,000. - No. When does the train come? - In two days. Two days. I'm the boss. Well, then... The robbery will take place here? It stops there? How long is the train? - 340 meters. And you're building the switch for your track here? How did Fiete calculate the distance to here? Rule of thumb. - Rule of thumb. How long do the marshals need to get here? 15 minutes. Our container is on the last wagon? - Rambo said so. Working for Kercher should be worth it, right? How long is the wagon? - About twelve meters. Twelve? Hold this. Under the ties and rails, we need steel plates. I'll calculate the strength tonight. Then they won't sink again. How will you get the wagon here? - With trucks. Trucks?- We'll tie up to the wagon with a rope and pull it into the forest. 40 tons of copper. Plus ten tons for the wagon. The trucks will get stuck in this ground pulling 50 tons. I can guarantee that. Now slow down, big guy. You do your calculations and we'll get the switch. Kamelle, come on! - Wait, I'm coming. It's really too hard for me. What now? This is more than unscrewing a church gutter. You don't want to go to jail either. What would happen to Peppa? You worry too much, Dreamy. The two of them have it covered. Stay close. Slow. Here we are. Stop! If I do this, you stop. Continue. We've got everything. Let's jet. Give me a hand. - What? We have to go. - The axle with the gears. Come on. Dude, don't overdo it. Blue Lagoon. Lift-off. And? - They stole rails again. Finish up here. The city can have what's left. Sure thing, Uncle. Hey, what was that thing earlier with the axles? Once a scrapper, always a scrapper. I'd give the guy who invented this a Novel Prize. I've tried to mix it myself 1,000 times. 70/40, 80/30... Doesn't work. Can't do it. Do you have a wife? And Simona? Simona was my counselor. During community service. Nine months later, Patrick was born. For Patrick and the new baby, I'm gonna build a huge playroom. With a loft bed, you know? And from up on the bed, you come down a slide. Hi, Mirko. - Morning. Want some? No, don't worry. Not our thing. Morning. - Morning. Freak. And? Everything go well yesterday? Any new numbers? Here's the number of steel plates we need. I recalculated the track length. Don't forget the rocker switch. Yeah, looks good. - One more thing... Can you get the Unimog motor going, Smitty? Raid! Raid, people! The fucking cops are here! Good morning, sergeant. - Good morning, gentlemen. Federal Police. This is an audit. Please assemble your staff and their identity cards. Where's the stuff from last night? - In the pit. Cut that gibberish, OK? Hey, that's our copper! In compliance with section 35, paragraph 1 of the Circular Economy Law, I need to see all receipts and confirmations of the suppliers of the precious metal. Then we'll have to take the copper. We know the law, gentlemen. We didn't find any rails. - Then look up in the house. May I see your court order? Excuse me? The court order for a warrant before you mess everything up. And you are? - Mirko Talhammer. I own this yard. How you're proceeding here borders on trespassing, Mr...? ...Martens. - Mr. Martens? Court order, please. After all, we know the law, Mr. Martens. We'll be back. To close you down. Do that. Take-off. - Bye! Kercher sent them. Who else? We have to watch out, they're onto us. We have to distract them from the rails. Diversions and all that. Come on, we have crap to do. Better dead than a slave.- Oh, Letscho, cut the "Better dead than a slave" shit. Careful. In the old days, in the East, scrap metal grew on trees. We just had to retrieve it. Grandpa, we're not in the East anymore. So we have to steal a train. Let's go, boys. Follow Letscho. There they are. Diversions and all that, right? Damn Kercher pests. Pizza? Clever guys, eh? Let's see. This is uniquely stupid. Don't look like that, number fairy. It'll work like a hot knife through butter. OK, It'll be awesome. Tomorrow morning! Right. 40 tons of copper to Rotterdam. Shit. What are you doing? - Wait. Shit. I have to close the switch or the train will be derailed. Shit. Train 2-8-33. Hopefully we have a free run to Rotterdam, I have a hot date there. Alright, Peter. With your sister at my mother's place or what? The train's coming! Luzi. - Wait. Damn. What are you doing here? Back to the cable. - Shit. Get off the tracks. - One second. - Hurry. It's coming. - Wait.- Do it. Go! - Shit! Clock's ticking. Shit. Go, Luzi. That's it. 13 minutes, go. So here's 2-8-33. Block signal. 8-3. Warning lights. Please check it. Will do. Go ahead. Do it! Switch it to green. I'll drive on slowly, you can check it later. What?- Get out and check it yourself. It's stuck. Pull it down. Now! Go! Train 2-8-33. Peter here. The grounding cable was severed, of course. Switch back to green. I'll drive slowly. Check it later. Finally. The train's moving. Hurry. Faster, faster. Lift it... Go. Seven minutes. Go, go, drive. The marshals! Shit! 40 tons of copper, as ordered. Train robbers! Not bad, brother. Load everything up. Don't forget a thing. We're off. We have to shred the copper. Our yard was to the right. A truck on rails! Dude, what are you doing? - Taking back our city. Are you nuts? Let me have my fun. You drive like a girl. Dad? Dad? What? I lost my scarf. Shit. Train robbers! If you break her heart, I'll kick your ass. You know that, huh? Letscho. I... Something happened, I... - Let's eat first. Here. A good luck charm. For... real Talhammers. Train robbers. Kercher, the old rat. Whatever anyone says about you, you have a sense of humor. That's for sure. If the cables aren't enough, you steal a whole train, right? Shit, how did he find out? - Unbelievable. Wolfgang, what is this? - I'll be brief. You robbed the city and are all going to jail. Unless, well, you know how it is: we load the copper and the two of you sign this purchase agreement for your yard. Then the whole thing stays between us. You can't do that. Let it go. Take the copper and leave them their yard. Let's let the cat out of the bag: here's your signature. It's right here. Mirko received 20,000 euros in cash for the tip-off concerning the robbery. What? What are you saying? - Mirko? Letscho, it's not true. You have five seconds. - Luzi? Thanks. And, Letscho? What'll it be? Signature or jail? Think of your kids. Thank you. And now your three crosses. Here. One call and the boys from the city will have rich pickings. Thanks. You have two days to pack your things. Then I'll tear all this shit down. Now take this stuff away. You have two seconds. Perpetrators stole a railway car with 40 tons of copper last night. The police are looking for witnesses who saw suspicious persons and vehicles. Please notify the local police if you have relevant information. Dreamy, Peppa. Mirko! - What are you doing here? Get in. Hello, Mirko! - Peppa... Lie down. - OK. Can we stay with you? What about the others? I know you didn't rat on us. Thanks, Dreamy. What... - It was me. What? - They followed me. I had to go back to the track for the scarf. Oh, shit. What could I do? Peppa was with me. Oh, shit. Then they went into the woods. Now it's all gone. Without the yard, we have nothing at all. That damn Kercher! He knew what was up right away. Our copper. He'll sell it himself now. He rips off the city, too. Fuck. Dreamy? What? - Dreamy? That's it. That's it! Shit. Dreamy? You drive. They're gonna kill me. I won't say anything, Dreamy. - Then they'll kill you. I didn't tell him our plan. I'm not stupid. Did you take money from Kercher? Unbelievable. What's he doing here? That train was our last chance to keep our yard. Then you show up and sell it to Kercher? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, Letscho asked. I have debts in Hamburg. Yes, I talked to Kercher about a sale. Take off. No one wants you here. Seriously. It's not over. We have a chance. - We... ...have no chance. The yard belongs to Kercher. What you have, what you're made of, it'll work anywhere. Not just in this yard. Trust me. Psychotic bastard. What are you doing with the horse from the town square? In the hall is a blue container, Kercher's moneybox. This is the code for the gate. Which one will you pick up tomorrow? - The green one. Tomorrow is rubble. 40 tons of copper. But keep it quiet. Uncle? You gotta see this. It was hanging by the gate. They just can't help themselves. No, it won't fit. I won't wear it. Think he understood it? Sure. Square. I'm not a square. I'm so chilled, I could slip off the bench. You ran around in these for 15 years, think about that. Square. Here we go. That one. This blue one. - Yeah. I'm going into Kercher's office. What's wrong with you? I thought we were through with being at each other's throats. But it looks like you only understand this one language. What does this psycho want from us? No idea. He must be confusing us. - My apologies. We were here for a meeting. If Fiete saw you, it'd break his heart. Train is ready. - Take-off. Wolle. One more. It's alright. You can take a Talhammer out of the junkyard but you can't get the junkyard out of a Talhammer, right? This is my city. We're off. On three, we stand up, OK? - Yeah. Morning. - Early this morning. Has to be done. Rubble's in front of the hall like always. - Alright. Off you go. - Yeah! Should I call an ambulance? - No, we're fine. It happened so fast, sir. - What happened? They were aggressive. We were in a meeting. - Who? Wolfgang Kercher. - The Kerchers. They stole the house... the horse. Unbelievable. Right. Are you sure it's that one? - Come on, I don't have all day. We have to ask the boss about the blue one. - Look at the numbers, not the colors. Got it? You bums. They'll leave us alone for a while now. So, one truck of rubble for the fine gentlemen. All legal and with a proper receipt. You look terrible. It's a good eight tons, Letscho. And Kercher? - He has visitors. He shouldn't have done that. First he stole the horse. - I had nothing to do with it. And then the copper. Man, oh, man. Your car, as agreed. And what'll you do now? Scrappin', what else? Some factories down south closed. Scrap grows on trees there. Make sure you get your shit in order at home. Would you look at that. Finally. And all dressed up for the road. A list of my clients. I bought the ones with a circle and line. Pay them or they'll cancel too. It's a pyramid scheme. It has to pay for itself. Funny, Mirko, but it won't work like that. I want my 100,000 or... Or what? I'll lose everything? Correct. You'll lose everything. Oh, well. Better dead than a slave. Well? Three expresso, please. And now? Where to? Where to? Down south. Scrap's growing on trees down there. Just like Rambo said. Scrappin'. Scrappin'. Scrappin'. Scrappin'. SCRAPPIN'
