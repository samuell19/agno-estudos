Mr. Premier... Ms. Saint-Amour, what a pleasure to meet you! The pleasure is all mine. Please. Thank you. I took the liberty of ordering the wine. I love your magazine. You're too kind. Don't miss the next issue, our 5th anniversary special. Mr. Premier... We have here a Château Latour, an elegant wine bursting with freshness, exuberance and powerful tannins. Just like you. Château Latour, a grand cru. Here's to you. To me? I'm intrigued. Custom dictates that we wait till the end of the meal to discuss business, but I'd like to get straight to the point. Arlette Saint-Amour, I need you. I want Culture to emerge from the shadows. And to be frank, I feel my government isn't exactly hip anymore. Am I wrong? You don't really want me to answer that? Please do. We get a vague impression that your government is sitting in a wax museum. Well, with your charm, flair and audacity, you have everything it takes to make us more youthful. You can't be serious. I need a woman like you as head of Culture. Me, a minister? I... I have a seat opening up. And as we say in politics, the stars have aligned, both for me and for you. Bon appétit. Take your time thinking it over, but... But you need an answer as soon as possible. Mr. Premier. I've thought it over. It's a yes. Do you always think so fast? It depends. Often, it's after. Oh my God! What have I done? In a democratic monarchy, all paths lead to court. All courtiers will tell you, with emotion, that they remember their first day at the Palace. The day they leave their life behind for a new form of existence: life at court! Now for Quebec news, Arlette Saint-Amour was sworn in today as our province's 30th minister of culture. Following a surprise entry into politics, Arlette Saint-Amour shared her reasons for accepting the position. It's the best day of my life! Today, I'm putting myself at the service of the grandest lady of all: culture. A seasoned journalist, Arlette Saint-Amour started her career at Elle-Québec. At 30 years old, she created F, a women's magazine that shattered sales records from its first issue. Tackling issues from anorexia to female genital mutilation in Africa, Arlette Saint-Amour is a fighter. Last spring, she was named a Great Montrealer, to honor her impressive career in fashion. I'm sorry to say it, gentlemen, but the 21st century will be led by women! Ambitious, intelligent and passionate women. Women with great minds and formidable brainpower, proud to have tits and an ass! An outspokenness we hope she will bring with her to the National Assembly. The Initiation What does she know about the ministry? About heritage? Ask me how I'm doing. Three ministers in two years: a lunatic, a loser and now a fashion icon. It's unbelievable. I love women, but not as their bodyguard. In an instant, you become their slave. Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? She's on her way. Everyone in the hall, now. Thank you. OK. Now that we've taken the time to complain about our new leader's ignorance, we're going to have to accept it. And show our new captain we can behave. So, repeat after me, please. "Welcome to Culture, Madam Minister." "Welcome to Culture..." OK! You got the snide remarks out of your system. It's done. Get over it. Smile. I can finally put a face to a name. Pierre-Olivier Caron, right? That's right, your chief of staff. Nice to meet you. Francine Beaulieu, Madam Minister, your general secretary. Laurent Deschamps, my press secretary. Hello! Murielle Mérisy, Deputy Minister of Culture. Hello. Paul Papineau, Associate Deputy Minister of Heritage Affairs. Julie Quin, crown corporations. Luc Quintal, archeologist for First Nations Cultural Development. Louis Thibault, Religious Heritage. Carole Gingras, Madam Minister, your bodyguard. Call me Arlette. It'll be easier. Hey, Carole! Can you do me a favor? Could you walk my dog? I left him with the guard at Door 6, but I'm worried. Of course. Thank you. You're too kind. Your office, Madam Minister. It's big. Yes, it's big. It lacks a little punch. It lacks the budget, Madam Minister. Culture is broke. Your briefings. Briefing? Your daily pittance, Madam Minister. So, we have the National archives... Geographical Names Board... French Language Council. Religious Heritage, First Nations Culture. There you have it. Thank you. Mr. Deschamps... Here is the party platform. Your wheelie suitcase. Your cell phone. A second one as backup. And a recorder for the minister's press conferences. This stuff isn't a gift from the Queen. It's so we can reach you 24 hours a day. In the city, in the country, wherever you go, bring it. You go pee-pee, bring it. It follows you to bed too. - Pee-pee? - Pee-pee. Is that clear? Crystal. I want to know everything about your life. Everything. Money, drugs, sex, anything that could end up on social media and get us in shit. What is your financial situation? Call my accountant. He does my taxes. She doesn't know. You lost your mother? Breast cancer. And sex? I have lovers. Lovers? Lovers, as in one-night stands, or as in team sports? As in no strings. Jesus! Are you always like this? Must get depressing at your place. I have a girlfriend in Paris, and I've been up for the delegation for ages, but there's always a new minister I have to teach how the machine works. Or keep on a short leash. I've never been on a leash. Politics isn't fashion. Fashion is cutthroat too. In your world, journalists want to see some skin. In politics, they want to skin you alive. Politics... is a big stage, Madam Minister. If you lose your footing, I have to dive into the cold water to save you. So... let me ask you a question. Your role as minister of culture, how do you envision it? I want artists to remember me as a minister who was willing to turn Quebec upside down to defend them. The ACC is out. Jesus! Already? The ACC? What's that? We've dealt with incompetent ministers for 12 years, but this is the cherry on top. What possessed the premier to put a starlet in Culture? We're sick of seeing selfies of ministers, who just get photographed on the red carpet at premieres. If they put some airhead in Finance, how do you think the business community would react? Artists deserve an intelligent, articulate and visionary minister to defend our interests in the Council, our rights in Ottawa, and to ensure the survival of who we are, the only French-speaking population in North America. Culture... culture isn't an accessory you pin onto a ball gown, Madam Minister, any more than it is the latest fashion. Welcome to Culture, Madam Minister. What is the ACC? The Arts and Culture Coalition. And what do they want? Your head. That was a short honeymoon. We'd be more welcome at the Status of Women. Valmont Faucher is a pretentious little theatre nerd who thinks fashion is bullshit. That your phone? Laurent Deschamps. Where's Sissi? We needed to get some air. Good. I thought she was dead. Shit! It's time. OK. It's all in there. 200 questions covering every topic in Culture. Starting now, you're living in a man's world. You mean the locker room? The questions period is a baptism by fire. Good luck. Why do I feel like I'm being thrown into a lion's den? Ever wonder why they never throw a lioness into the den? Not since this morning. Because a lioness doesn't just roar. She kills. Go, sweetie. Please welcome your new MNA for Anne-Hébert. Welcome. Thank you. Come. Go ahead. On my side. Go on. Jeez. It's good luck! Thank you. It's going to be fine. Hi. Alexandre Ducros, staffer for the finance minister. Laurent Deschamps, press secretary for the minister of culture. Mr. Leader of the Opposition. This time... it's gone too far, Madam President. The government has hit rock bottom. We've all heard the artists' anger. The premier could have surprised us. But no. He chooses incompetence every time. A pom-pom girl in Culture! Silence! Silence! Please. Please. Need I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the word "pom-pom" is not permitted here. Mr. Leader of the Opposition, please withdraw your remarks. I withdraw the "pom-pom." You're terrible. Culture is not inherited, but won. When will Quebec finally get a Malraux in this chamber? Malraux... I'll respond. What the hell is she doing? Pinch me, I'm dreaming! What century is this? Madam Minister! Please be seated. Mr. Premier... The pom-pom girl the Leader of the Opposition is referring to became a stylist, journalist, founded a magazine... And fought against suits like you who still dismiss women as pom-pom girls. It's my turn to ask a question. How many ministers were actually ministers before becoming one? Nobody is born a minister, sir. You become one. Madam President, need I remind the minister of culture my question was addressed to the premier? And my answer was addressed to you. She's crazy, but she's got balls. Madam Minister! Such audacity! Such eloquence! Party allegiances make us exaggerate sometimes. Welcome to our ranks. Madam Minister... Madam Minister! Over here! Pierre-Luc François, News Flash. How did it feel to be in the chamber for the first time? I had butterflies in my stomach, like the first time you enter any room not knowing what to expect. Philippe Bourguignon, 6 o'clock news. What would you say to those who just see you as a starlet? That I hope to make them drop the "let." Christine Petit, Madam Minister, journalist with Quebec News. Yes? Stylist, journalist, director of a fashion magazine, and now minister. Yep! What's life without surprises? What do you bring to the role of minister of culture? A fresh take. That's it? Every minister of culture before you had a fresh take. It's been the same old speech for 25 years. But coming from you, a woman who fought for her space in the fashion world, we expected something more original. It's very disappointing. I'm disappointed. Yes, Madam Minister... Let me rephrase the question, Madam Minister. What will you do differently in Culture? Get artists the $100 million the finance minister promised them in the last election. Fucking hell! Laurent Deschamps. Congratulations! $100 million for Culture! We couldn't have asked for more. If your goal was to make an enemy of the finance minister, mission accomplished. By the way, how did you come up with $100 million? It's clearly written in the party platform. It's written in the Bible that Jesus rose from the dead. This is madness. You have to control her. She's like a chicken with her head cut off. This is politics. It's no laughing matter. Now send me a press release that says you were wrong. And never again will you shovel your shit in Finance's yard. You dump it on the other side of the chamber, not ours. From now on, Laurent, I expect you to put words in her mouth, OK? Master the art of saying the same damn thing 20 times without seeming repetitive. You know? 1-2-3-4. 4-3-2-1. 2-3-4-1. Got it? Today was a complete failure. What sin did I commit in life to deserve this? Listen... No way am I retracting! If I've learned anything in life, it's never to back down. Don't waste your time writing something I won't sign. Fuck the finance minister! Exactly. No, you're right. Politics takes balls. You might be sexy, but you can't have sex with the entire population. You think? Why did they put her in Culture? Not enough gays! They couldn't find sissies! It's true. If the premier tears his shirt on the job, someone will be there to mend it. Forgive him. Well, we got a little preview of what to expect. Arlette, just shut up and look pretty. Shut your mouth, for Christ's sake. You can use it for other things. You're terrible. - It had to be said. - It's true. Now for the weather... Learning the Rules of the Game Beautiful evening. Thank you for the invitation. Let me introduce you to Léopold Morin, MNA for Mauricie, our doyen! Good evening. Germain Taillefer, MNA for Joliette, and Marcel Beaulieu, from Rimouski. Good evening. Quite the racehorse you found us, Romain. Arlette Saint-Amour! Margaret! You look sublime. Thank you. Do you still have your gallery? Yes. But you... Well done. We need more women! Paul! Come. Arlette, let me introduce my husband, Paul Girouard, the finance minister. Surely, you've met before? I haven't had the honor. Nice to meet you. And you. Photo! - Mr. Premier... - Yes. Thank you. It's not good for your blood pressure. Some things are forgivable when you're starting out in politics... like interrupting me in the questions period. But don't push it. Politics is a dangerous game. Best not to make too many enemies at the start. And the hardest thing in politics... is surviving the first hundred days. Tell me... Why Arlette Saint-Amour? Her beauty? Her youth? Her political virginity? She's a goddamn novice. In politics, yes, but not in PR. We'll be on the news every night. Oh, that's what you want! To eclipse the man who dreams of filling your sneakers. He's not dreaming anymore. No way am I letting a fiscal evangelist take my place. Valmont, you know I've always admired your work. Your mises-en-scène in Dublin, Venice, and all your work in experimental theatre, truly. I love people like you, who can navigate between the margins and the establishment. Never call me an airhead on TV again. Our dirty laundry, we air it at home, not in public. Is that clear? Valmont... Do you like opera? I love opera. My mother always listened to opera while sewing her costumes. Your mother was a seamstress? Head seamstress for all the major costume designers. I spent my youth in the tiara from La Tosca, before I even knew the Puccini opera. And Arlette, is that from your mother too? My grandmother. She loved Arletty. "Atmosphere, atmosphere! Do I look like an atmosphere?" "I'm not beautiful! I'm alive! That's all." After the break, we'll be at the National Assembly's Red Hall with our new minister of culture, Arlette Saint-Amour. What's going on with me? I'm nervous. That's good. I'd be worried if you weren't. Listen, sweetie. That miserable woman, she'll try to get you with the silences, long fucking silences. Whatever you do, don't fill them. Smile. Show your teeth. And this time, no $100 million. No cash, nothing. Don't go off-script. Basically, shut your mouth, Arlette. Yes, but more ladylike. So, spirited and passionate to some, bumbling and hot-headed to others, making you a controversial figure. Arlette Saint-Amour, hello. Hello. Happy to be here? I'm happy to see you again. You already seem comfortable with the decorum. Were you born to be a minister? So? Tell us about a day in the life of a minister like you. It's like going to the amusement park. We start Monday with the Slingshot. Tuesday is the Boomerang. Then things really take off: the Splash, the Vampire and... the Monster, for Saturday's grand finale. Mr. Premier. Admit it. Not bad for a novice! Sure. How is your relationship with Finance? Are you suggesting we have a bad relationship? You're avoiding the question. We all know Finance and Culture don't always speak the same language. Yes, but the artists, will they get their $100 million? Yes. A resounding yes. If there's one thing I believe, it's that artists are entitled to that $100 million, Christine. Laurent Deschamps. Drag her here by the ponytail. We have a crisis. Does the crisis have a name? Is it bad? Worse than bad. Should I be contemplating suicide? The finance minister, Madam Minister... is a shark who swallows all the little fish in his way. All of them. Don't look for his soft side. He doesn't have one. He married a rich English-speaking Canadian and became the poster boy for the establishment. They put him in office to cut everything that costs money and doesn't make any. The poor... - Women... - Of course. And your artists. So he decided to teach you a lesson. The lesson of a powerful man provoked by a novice. In his next budget, the finance minister... plans to tax books. Well, he's getting himself in shit. No, he's getting us in shit. It's a disaster. The arts were already on our back. Now we'll have arts and literature right in our faces! Authors, editors, booksellers, libraries, universities... I got it. ...teachers, children, parents! They'll never forgive you. Never! You'll be guillotined in the public square, under the indifferent gaze of the people. Because nobody reads, Madam Minister. Nobody. But the book is untouchable. Ever since Gutenberg, the book has been the very symbol of culture. Culture is under siege. We have to defend ourselves! So now, my question for you is... are you ready to lay your head on the chopping block? Settling Scores We could have met at a restaurant, but with social media these days... You're right. In this town, even the tables have ears. Have you ever leaked information? Yes. What's it like the first time? The first time is always the worst. Like with anything. That's what I thought. I caught wind that the finance minister plans to tax books. That's just like him. You know my hands are tied, but we can agree that... In a society, the book must be defended. It transcends party lines. How are you, Mireille? Mr. Premier... Order, please! Thank you. We will begin. Mr. Leader of the Opposition... Madam President, I'm hearing rumors. And the one circulating now could create an unprecedented crisis in the world of culture. Will the finance minister confirm if, yes or no, he intends to tax books in his next budget? Tell me it isn't true! It is a disastrous proposition, Madam President, and I'm weighing my words. A tax on books is a tax on knowledge. A tax on books is a tax on humanity. It's taxing the masterpieces written before us and making insignificant the only human quality that isn't: imagination! Sadly, Madam President, all too often, the only book a politician holds in his hands is his autobiography! Which an author had to write in his place. Mr. Minister of Finance... Madam President, need I remind the Leader of the Opposition that a budget is never discussed in chambers before it is tabled? I expect you to apologize to the finance minister within the hour. Why is the premier sending me to the slaughterhouse? Well, seeing as you personally delivered a secret to the enemy, and everyone knows you were the leak, your plan was a failure. But not a mistake. To play the game, you have to know the rules. You made a rookie mistake. You told me to put my head on the chopping block. Not serve it to the finance minister on a silver platter! Not her again. The tax is an unfounded rumor, Madam Minister. Got it? An unfounded rumor. Madam Minister... How are you reacting to this rumored tax on books? It's a non-starter. Once again, the opposition needed a story. What can I say? It's hard for them to write a new comedy every day. It's an unfounded rumor. Excuse me. Goddammit! This is bullshit! I try to clean up the finance minister's mess, and now I have to apologize? Apologizing is regretting your actions. Presenting your apologies is regretting you got caught. See the difference? Culture has always been at the mercy of the finance minister. Always. His wish is our command. Why? Because he signs the fucking checks. Fuck! Go on. Come in. Minister... Diane, it's done. To what do I owe the pleasure? You know... the first image that came to mind when I learned you planned to tax books... Usually, people come see me to ask for something. I'm sure. But maybe we'd like to come see you to teach you something. Like, I don't know, that Quebec ranks ninth in Canada for the quality of its libraries. Our population already struggles with literacy. How far will we go down this path of ignorance? I'm not saying being illiterate is a crime. But a minister who... A minister who taxes culture is a minister seriously lacking in culture. What are you thinking? Politically, it's a catastrophe. Do you know what it is to write a book? Or worse, not to have a goddamn cent to buy one? If I ever knew, I forgot. Sorry. I was vaccinated against beggars. Anyway, I'm here... To apologize? To team up. To team up? To team up, sweetie... we'd have to be in the same league. And as far as I know, you're still in the minors. You're nothing to the premier. You know that? Just a pawn on his chessboard. He's just using you for your image. I will admit, you're serving him perfectly. So just be happy to play the part and be what you've always been... a vulgar photo of a starlet on a glossy magazine cover. I knew it! It wasn't a meeting, it was an audience! Girouard, Holy Father! Fuck! I'm sick of being humiliated! In the chamber, by the ACC, by the fucking finance minister! Jesus Christ! Am I just here to fail? That's it. In Culture, you're minister of nothing. The health minister is someone. The education minister too. But the culture minister is minister of fuck all. What the hell am I doing here? I don't go out anymore. I don't sleep, fuck, see my friends. I don't even have friends anymore. Everyone hates me. Get me out of here. I'm suffocating. You know my mother... the great seamstress for all the major costume designers. I embellished. The truth is... she hemmed pants in Hochelaga to send me to good schools. But in exchange, I had to live up to her dreams. And you didn't today? And she's right there, over my head, to remind me. Sweetie, your debts to your mom, you paid them a long time ago. And I'll let you in on a secret too. My mother... was a winter carnival pageant queen. I've never bragged about that either. We're all allowed a few lies. You've always had a weakness for women. It helps boost your image as our nation's father. But with Arlette Saint-Amour, you're like a doddering, proud grandpa. It's a joke. It's rare for Finance to be so bothered by Culture. Indeed, your plan worked. Not like yours, Paul! Taxing books... Are we still in the same government? We tax children's shoes. Why not books? We're all equal in the eyes of the taxman. Is that a fact or an opinion? It's the simple truth. The poor, the unemployed, artists... What are they to you? Start-ups in the making? Do you really think writers write better when they're starving? If we treat human beings like businesses, we'll all end up alone. Society will be replaced by stockholders. A few big, and a billion small. Maybe, but we need to clean house before we hit a wall. And you want to start your purge in my term? You're nearing the end, Mr. Premier. Your reign is over. Oh yeah? I'm not dead yet. Big day? Big day, little week for compliments, as my mother would say. Thank you. Let's not beat around the bush, Mr. Premier. From what I understand, I'm a box in your organizational chart, and I'd like to know what role I'm playing. The lunatic you keep spinning around on your chessboard... or the marionette who takes all the blows. Depends who you're asking: the man or the premier? I'd be happy with a single answer. Unfortunately, there are two. If you ask the man, it's neither. If you ask the premier, it's a little of both. It takes a thick skin to do this job. MNAs have to play the game and get played. Fine for the game, but what do we do now? You let me loose in the traffic, and I run over Girouard? Or can I count on you? You think I can control Girouard? Don't tell me you lack the power to cancel a tax. I could, if this was a dictatorship. But I'm leader of a party that is by definition democratic, where the financial establishment nonetheless retains the privilege of choosing its finance minister. But although Girouard serves his masters well... I admit... we're faced with a new beast. Girouard and his gang have turned the economy into a religion. And like most men of faith, he has no qualms about making cuts in education, health, culture... in the name of his church, austerity. Have you ever been to a bull fight? But... just yesterday, I came face to face with a bull ready to gore me. Politics is like a bull fight. You advance, retreat, strategize. Before you can control the beast, you have to exhaust it by waving your cape to make it charge. The budget is four months away, just enough time to get Girouard to back off and remind him that culture gives our nation meaning. On one condition. If I step into the ring... you're coming with me. Let's welcome our very own prima donna. Good evening. Please sit. Is it true you're seen as a drama queen in parliament? What drama am I causing? I'm indignant that we treat artists as beggars when they bring in more money than the subsidies they're given. If that makes me a drama queen, bring me a crown. Do you like it spicy or plain, Madam Minister? Spicy! What does the minister of culture do? Protects artistic freedom. Your favorite novel? Kamouraska by Anne Hébert for the passionate love story. Your favorite play, Madam Minister? I love and defend all Quebec authors, but I admit I have a soft spot for Michel-Marc Bouchard's Girl King. What do books mean to you? Books allow you to dream of another life. And culture? The freedom to dream. We need dreams. We need artists. We all dream of being an artist, but the truth is we need artists to teach us to dream. "My people are forced to believe what we tell them to believe "and repeat what we have them believe. "We need schools, libraries, scholars, poets. I want to make my country the most sophisticated of all." That text gives me wings. Will the minister finally tell us, yes or no, if she'll get $100 million for culture? Since when does culture give up in the face of the economy? Mr. Premier, you're everywhere. Correction! Culture is everywhere. You follow her everywhere! With me already under your skin... She's everywhere. She's the minister of the hour. Polls show she is the most popular minister in her government. It's simple. I love her. She's so awesome, we listen to the questions period now. Our children have to squat our theatres, libraries and museums. Culture must be at the heart of education. If causing a stir means objecting to raising a generation of accountants conditioned to zero deficit, then yes. Yes, I'm causing a stir. Culture is Quebec's most valuable resource! From time to time, in court, a young star appears in the sky over the palace. Will it shine bright or pass through like a shooting star? The bets are open. Do you like being called Arlette? Art and letters, isn't that the root of Arlette? And if I say culture isn't profitable? I'd say that the pyramids of Egypt, the Gardens of Versailles and La Scala in Milan weren't profitable. Culture is the only means people have to leave a trace of their passage on Earth. Do you believe in the power of the dress, Madam Minister? They say the clothes make the man. But for a woman, the dress is a second skin she chooses according to her moods. And what mood are you in today? Seductive. CULTURE IN POWER MONEY FINANCE - ECONOMY - MARKETS CULTURE IN POWER ARLETTE SAINT-AMOUR, ARTISTS' MINISTER I can't take it anymore. I just can't. She's everywhere. FULL SERVICE Yes? Sorry to bother you, but do you have a minute? Of course. 'Cause my situation is unbelievable. If it's any comfort, mine too. What can I do for you, Mr... Thibodeau. I own this garage, which your people designated a historic site. But... Your garage is that old? Those dimwits zoned too big. The cemetery is historic, not my garage, dammit! I can't even move a car anymore without getting permission. It's hell, Madam Minister. I've had it. You're my last resort. Pardon me. You're right. We'll sort it out with those dimwits, OK? This is Laurent Deschamps, my press secretary. - Hi. - He'll take care of you. Thank you, Madam Minister. Good luck. - Yes, Francine. - Yes, Arlette? I just got an urgent call from the Protocol. You'll never believe it. France is coming! And you'll replace the minister of commerce to escort a French minister to an official dinner. And what do I have to do with Commerce? Honestly, they couldn't find anyone else. You cold? There are no words. I'm so cold, my bones are cold. I was expecting the minister of commerce. What a pleasure to meet his colleague in Culture. Nice to meet you, Madam Minister. Justine d'Arcy. Call me Justine. Arlette Saint-Amour. Call me Arlette. After you. Pretend you like her, like you do with me. You know my colleague is a culture fanatic? Especially opera. It's true that politics are a lot like opera. I'm Mozartian. You? Let me guess. Verdi, I bet. La traviata! And you, Arlette? Between Callas and Tebaldi, who makes you tick? Callas, for her flamboyance. And Tebaldi... for her determination in trying to dislodge her. There's something I should tell you. Paul still intends to tax books. I don't know what he's planning, but he's produced a study proving only the rich buy books. Other than those who write them, who will protest a tax on the rich? You have to admit it's clever. Indeed. He hates losing. He goes for the jugular. Things must be lively at the breakfast table. We're only a couple publicly. He's OK with that? He mostly needs my father, who needs his son-in-law, the finance minister, in his pocket. They even share a mistress. While they obsess over free markets, I devote myself... to freeing my sexuality. Do you have a lover? It's been a while. So you have a choice. You can either be the minister contemplating still lifes, or the minister of performing arts, who needs to make love to recharge. See you at the table. I visited the National Assembly today. Impressive, isn't it? A gallery of great men. You must come see ours, Arlette. We have entire walls of politicians who don't even deserve to be woven into an old rug. Ladies and gentlemen... I'd like to make a toast to our guest of honor, the minister for international trade, Ms. Justine d'Arcy. Thank you for welcoming me to your beautiful country. Quebec and France have always maintained a special relationship. Thank you very much. And cheers! Mr. Minister, may I ask what we're drinking? It's exquisite. A great Quebec wine. Cuvée Natashquan. That's just it. This wine is a perfect example of our culture. Despite our harsh climate, a determined winemaker can transform a bitter wine into a wine bursting with panache. We have to rewrite history, Madam Minister. What an error our kings made. What sacrilege! Trading Louisiana for these acres of snow, where incredible warmth envelops us tonight. Justine... I'll trade you... 400 years of history... for one more orgasm. Open Warfare I can't believe it. Jonathan... Doing well? Look at that miserable woman. Get your machine out. I have a surprise. - No. - Yes. Please no. Madam Minister, may I ask you a few questions? I hope I can answer, Christine. Despite your earnest desire to defend culture, your entire media campaign will have been a waste of time if it's just to improve your own image. That's your opinion. You think so? According to our sources, the finance minister still intends to tax books. Your wishes aren't reality, Christine. Well, his wishes are reality. My question is simple. How would you react to such a tax? Well... I'd turn the bad into good. We could use the tax dollars to restock all the empty shelves in our school libraries. My minister is anything but boring. What does that do for us, empty shelves in our libraries? We were never tied to that! Well, let's tie ourselves. We'll tie our hair, hands, feet, but never my mouth. Let him have his tax! But don't stop me from trying to spend it. I like suffering, but I won't play Joan of Arc burning at the stake on budget night. - OK, listen... - Forget it. I won't change my mind. The ACC is tweeting, Madam Minister. Jesus Christ! Go on! Move it. Your dog, Madam Minister. I never have time for him. No, puppy... Auntie Carole will take care of you. Can you get my dry cleaning? It's on your way. Thanks. You're the best. Thank you. Goddammit. It's not the first time a minister forgets us. But whose bright idea was it not to consult us? If it makes you feel better, I wasn't consulted either. I'm disappointed, Madam Minister. We expected more from you than more feigned powerlessness. The tax will bring in $40 million a year. $40 million to buy Quebec books, to promote our authors. Not French or American authors. Our authors. You can't be against that. Yeah. And who says the tax dollars won't just feed the deficit? Me. Sure. I have the premier's support. We just spoke. He gave me his word. Actually... Where I grew up, we read Bazooka Joe comics to feed our imagination 'cause we were so poor. We have an opportunity. The opportunity to bring beauty, greatness, dreams to our schools. Believe me, when you don't have a penny to your name, but you're holding a book, you're rich. I'm asking you to join my campaign. It's time to get out there and make enough noise to wake the entire province. But I'm not the enemy here. It's the finance minister. You're not the only one worried about the finance minister. Cheers, Arlette. Cheers. My question is simple, very simple. The premier's support, does she have it? Did she dream she had it? Or does she think she could get it? It's more the last two choices. We climbed out of a hole to fall into an abyss. You exasperate me to no fucking end! And I'm being polite. At some point, she's gonna have to rein it in. I guarantee you that won't happen. Look, you can get up on your high horse... or tell me... how to get the premier's support. Certainly, yes. Take notes. First... to get, maybe, the premier's political support, you'll need support from the rural MNAs. Politically, our caucus is split in two, OK? There's Girouard's establishment caucus on one side, and the premier's rural caucus on the other side. That's it. To overturn Girouard's tax, the premier will need support from every rural MNA. Every last one of them. And that's your job. You guys have a spot for me? You know how to play poker? Mostly online poker. Best cure for insomnia. Fortune is already smiling down on you. Get her a chair. Sit. Madam Minister. Kind gentlemen... That's us! Usually, ministers come to our floor when they have something to ask us. No politics tonight, Germain. Only cards! OK. Let's see your chips. I'd take a drink. Of course! Yes! Scotch? Does he always deal such a bad hand? We're off to a good start! Cheers, everyone! Cheers! Where are you from? I'm from Hochelaga. It's not as western as you guys, but it's pretty damn rock and roll. You can say that again! We've been watching you, and you've got class. Yeah. It's true. You're as comfortable with high society as you would be at the county fair. We'd have to stop you from hopping bareback onto a horse. Or joining the rodeo. We like women with balls here. Thank you. OK, who's left? Me. Now we're talking. Is he bluffing? What do I do? Look at her! Léopold! Come on, Léo! What do you have? I knew it! You have a tell. And voilà! Full house, Christ! Nothing like a game of cards to clear your head. You're clearing your head, but filling your purse. OK, let's bring out the vodka. Another one? - Yep. - Jesus! - Madam Minister? - Yeah, two for me. Thank you very much. To the minister of culture! To you! Marcel, you've been talking about it for ages. Did you ever get funding for your slaughterhouse? May I? Since when is a culture minister interested in a slaughterhouse? Not only am I interested, but I'd be ready to clear my schedule to announce it with you. What's this? Let me tell you something, boys. Agriculture is a passion of mine. I'm serious. No, but milking a cow, you know... A teat in one hand, zing zing into the pail. Send a little shot to the cat at your side. Now, that's a feeling! Yeah, yeah. Maurice, I haven't forgotten about you. The money for your drilling hoses, I'll back you on that. Like the Saint-Onézime bridge, which could be designated... historic. That's why I come here. To escape all the monks' squabbles at the monastery, where all low blows are allowed. Usually, the seas are stormier with you. At the speed you're learning, you'll be a seasoned politician in no time. Do you have my caucus's support yet? I spent the evening with your caucus's head office. Oh yeah? And? I got their support. And Girouard? P.O. is in Finance to announce our majority. Turning a tax into books. It's like the wedding at Cana! Well played, Arlette! Well played. Have you gone blind and deaf, Mr. Premier? Enough is enough! Oh yeah? Yes! She's gone too far. We have to take disciplinary measures. I know she's still learning, but there are limits. Rules are rules, and solidarity among ministers is one of them. I want you to intervene and get her in line. Christ! Mr. Minister... Do what you have to do, but find me something, anything. Take her down. There has to be someone in her little world who can get us some dirt. You can count on me. Good evening. Madam Minister. Thank you. You know what? I think I'm about to feel some love. You know how much I admire artists. But I think I'm finally part of their big family. Tonight, I'm the minister of artists. Let's go. Stand by, we're back from the break. Three, two, one... we're on. FRENCH MUSIC GALA And now, Mr. Valmont Faucher, president of the Arts and Culture Coalition will say a few words. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests... Allow me to begin by paying tribute to our minister of culture. Let's give her a big hand for her defense of writers and their rights on the issue of the book tax. I admit, Madam Minister, your inclination toward Quebec artists is more than refreshing. Thank you. But where there is praise... there is also blame. Here we go! It is regrettable that a minister glorified for defending our culture is silent when it comes to defending its very core... our language. Like anyone who cares about defending the French language, I was scandalized to learn that the Ministry of Culture finances French-language music and English-language music in equal measure. Need I remind Madam Minister that Quebec songwriters are being crushed by Internet giants? Stay on the minister's face. One English song on a French record will become two, three, four... until the day we're proud to see a single French song on an English record. Soon, all we'll have left of our language will be a vulgar translation of "Je me souviens." You're in deep shit, sweetie. It's one thing to parade around on TV, bragging about our culture. It's another to live it every day and defend it in your guts! But to understand, you'd have to be an artist. Show your teeth. Smile. Smile. This is awesome. Well played, Mr. Ducros. A language scandal always pays off. And what did her humiliation cost us? You're a real piece of shit. Don't talk to me like that. I'll talk to you... I'll talk to you how I want. You gave us your word. I had no choice. I've waited seven years for funding to build my new theater. That gives you the right to be an asshole? An asshole with a new theater. You're forgetting something. Your theater's operation is financed by Culture. You don't have the power to do that. I don't. But I can make sure your file gets buried under a huge fucking pile, though. And don't go crying to the finance minister. He's done with you. Politicians are human beings. Tonight, it wasn't the politician you publicly humiliated. It was the human being. And the human being and her press secretary will never forgive you. Valmont Faucher... Fucking two-face liar. What was that? You wanted me humiliated in front of a million people? I didn't. But obviously, Girouard did. He ransacked the ministry to find the flaw. It's your job to find out before, not after! I had a deal with the ACC. I was betrayed! Yeah, but it seems the ACC has a deal with everyone, including Finance. They bought him a new theater in exchange for your public humiliation. An artist's noblesse is knowing how to bite the hand that feeds them. Know what your problem is, Laurent? You're always above everything. You always control everything. You're always telling me what to do, what to think, what to say, how to breathe, how to fucking smile! But what you can't say is that you made a mistake, a fucking big one! Fuck your problems! Fuck you, fuck everything! I'm always protecting you, saving your ass, worrying about you. Defending you, fussing over you like a sister and dealing with your shit all day long. "Me, me, me! What does he think of me?" But now, Arlette, it's not you who can't breathe. It's me. I'm suffocating. You're sucking my air, and that's not exactly what I had in mind, Arlette! Sort your own shit out. What? I just thought you could walk your dog while you're at it. Come here, puppy. Come. What do you have against me? It is personal or general? Cold as ice. Zero emotion. Always ready to fight to kill. The perfect pit bull, but in reality... his father-in-law's little puppy. You married the establishment, Minister. But you'll never really be part of it. They'll always keep you in a separate room... like with your wife! To speak your language, you pay all the expenses, and they get all the profits. A nice little doggy who wags his tongue and shakes a paw. Finally, the statue comes to life. Am I getting under your skin? You're not getting under my skin. You're under my skin! I can't stand you. My skin crawls when you show up in chambers. You think you can do anything. You don't give a shit. Fuck the ministers. Fuck business. Fuck our leaders. Let me tell you something. To anyone who knows anything, you're a fucking loser. Have you ever looked in the mirror? You're just a worthless little doll. A fucking empty shell. You're nothing, and you always will be. Idiot! DOWN SOUTH RESTAURANT OPEN 24 HOURS DINER OPEN 24 HOURS Down, sir. You look like hell. Nothing for me, thanks. I didn't think politics would be this hard. You could have eyes on the back of your head, but you can't see everything coming. It fucking hurts. You work so hard, and all you get is a slap on the face. Like I did with you yesterday. I'm sorry. Can I ask you a question? Who am I? Who you are... and who you've always been... Arlette in all her glory. That's it. To you, I'm Arlette. In politics, I'm Madam Minister. It's as if... It's as if I'm playing a part in a play. When the actress leaves the stage and looks in the mirror, she becomes herself again. But me... when I leave the arena and look in the mirror... I become who I am again... Arlette. It's not me they stapled onto posts to get elected. It's the MNA. It's not me they attacked yesterday. It's the minister. I have to get used to it. Let her live her life, and I'll live mine. The Big Leagues The entire chamber is against you. She has charm, Paul. That's why you're so jealous. I'm not a woman. I don't need charm. Charm doesn't have a gender. When you were a kid... did you have books at home? ...do you want to deprive children in Quebec from having them? Now you're the abuser. Like a lot of you who are like me, from humble origins... I grew up in a house without books. Which, believe me, makes the poor even poorer. No one should be punished for being born poor! And whether they come from rich or underprivileged families, every child in Quebec has a right to share in the dividends of our culture. Too many children like me have never known the pleasure of having a book of their very own. That's why today, in this chamber, I am announcing that the book tax will be used to purchase novels, poetry books and graphic novels, which will be handed out for free to all children in all of our schools. Excellent budget, Mr. Minister. Well done. And great performance! I learned a lot, thanks to you. Congratulations, Mr. Minister. It's a beautiful gesture. Don't be naive, Mr. Ducros. In politics, everyone wants the bad guy to be good deep down. Good evening! As you know, the last government left us with crippling debts. But after four years in power... Madam Minister! What you did for our children is amazing. Books are what keep me alive. Or keep me from dying of boredom on the night shift. Thank you, Arlette. My pleasure. I took the liberty of ordering champagne. Wonderful idea! It's a presidential vintage. It's sparkling, dignified... Something sweet for the palate. A sweet-talker. That's you. Is that a flaw? No, it's a strength. Especially for a leader. "Arlette Saint-Amour, I need you. "Your charm, flair and audacity... You have everything it takes to make us more youthful." In the end, Mr. Premier, you used me. You manipulated me like a director manipulates his actress. It's true. The only way around it is to become a director yourself. To you! To the end of my apprenticeship! Which was a resounding success. The art of politics is not giving blows, but knowing how to take them when you need to. That's just it. You know I can no longer be satisfied playing in the minor leagues. You want to leave Culture? But I need something concrete from you. The $100 million. It's my graduation gift. I thought I'd round it up to $125. Better... But I know you well enough to know you have an ulterior motive. I'd like to add the role of deputy premier to your job. Another honorary title. You know women are more than quotas? Arlette, I want you by my side. I probably won't run in the next election. We need to take advantage of the next few years to block the path of someone we don't want in power. Will you be my heir? That's better than a marriage proposal! I'll give you time to reflect, but... But you need an answer as soon as possible? Cheers. I've thought it over. It's a yes. In life at court, the ambitions, stakes, betrayals, the successes and the failures, it's all fleeting. True or false, it doesn't matter. Appearances change in time, but the game endures.
