Hey. You're home early. Yes. I thought you were showing a house today. I canceled it. Um. Is everything okay? It will be. I hope. Did something happen to Anna? No, she's fine. So... what's going on? I know about you and Vivienne. Who? - I can explain. - I don't want to hear your explanation. I want you to listen to me. Sit down. You know, this is not what it looks like. Sure it is. You've been fucking a woman named Vivienne. She's one of your creative writing students. Does she know you're married? I'm so fucking sorry. I'm gonna make this easy on you. I'm not divorcing you. I love our family and I love the life that we've built and I'm not throwing it away. We can get therapy. First, you will never see Vivienne again. Other than to tell her that it's over. - Of course. - Second... neither of us will mention this to Anna. Well, I agree with that. Third, we're going on a vacation. - A what? - A family vacation. You, me and Anna. - Okay. - Our life, our... family, it means more to me than anything in the world. Me too. Now... go pick up Anna from soccer practice, please. I still don't understand why I have to come with you guys. 'Cause you're too young to leave at home. Are we almost there? It's a surprise. You know how I can tell you picked this place - and not Dad? - Hmm? Because it's hot, it's in the middle of nowhere and it's boring. You know what they say, honey. "There are no boring places. - Only boring people." - "Boring people." That's right. You know, if I were her age, I wouldn't really wanna spend a week out here either. Well, thanks for humoring me then. No, I didn't mean it like that. I just... I'm sure you did. Hey. I... I'm trying. Try harder. Whoa. Wait until you see the pool. Holy shit. Language. No, but I mean, get real, Dad. This place is huge. This is really where we're staying? I've been talking about coming here for months. I even showed it to you online and said I wanted to visit. - You don't remember, do you? - Uh. Um. Yeah, well, the owner's selling it and hired my agency to handle the details. It goes on the market in a month. In the meantime, they're letting us stay. They've been using it as a rental. I told you that too, but you don't remember. Who'd own a house like this way out here? Someone very rich and very tired of other people. Get the bags. It's beautiful. Not so boring now, is it? Is the person selling this house really old or something? To be honest, I don't know who owns this house. It's part of a trust. Two hundred acres of land. Everything was done through an intermediary. They specifically asked me to handle the listing. Come on, Tub Tub. Hi, baby. Don't let Tub Tub loose outside. There are coyotes here. Oh, can I pick my own bedroom? Sure. They're upstairs. What now? I need to set up the camera for the virtual tour. Sorry about the floor. Jesus Christ. I could use a drink. There's a store about 20 miles up the road. I saw a sign. We can get groceries and wine. I was thinking of cooking veal cutlets tonight. Or I could grill burgers. Anna and I hate veal. Great. Veal cutlets it is. You know, just 'cause I messed up, don't be spiteful. Oh. I'm being spiteful? I really don't know what the rules are anymore. Well, it was your idea to come here. And you're lucky because the other option's divorce and I don't think that'd work out too well for you. Yeah, you would take Anna and the money. - I've heard the threats before. - Then they must be true. I hate this. Same. You know what? I need a drink too. Go get food and wine. Anna, come on. Mom wants us to run an errand. - Oh, come on, I'm having fun. - Yeah, I know. Yeah, here. Need a little help. Wow. Looks like we're the city slickers around here. We're city slickers everywhere, Dad. - What? you're not gonna help me shop? - Sorry, Dad. Vintage fashion magazines are more interesting. - Oh. - What do you want me to do? Okay. Hey. What you reading? Nothing. Where you from? Houston. Wow. That far? My name's Isaac. I'm Anna. You know what, Anna? You look a lot like my ex-girlfriend. - I do? - Yeah. Way cuter, though. Where are you and your dad staying? I saw you come in with him. My mom's here with us too. They're not getting along. They mean to you? No. They're fine. Um. We're staying at this big, old house on the water in the middle of nowhere. I think I know it. Uh. About 20 miles east? Yeah, I think so. My dad drove. So... How old are you? I'm almost 15. Really? You look a lot older. We should get some ice cream sometime. I'm 18. I'll drive. - Who were you talking to? - Hmm? You making friends over there? Shut up. - Register's broken. - Uh-huh. Hey. You wanna help me bag these things up? Yeah. You know, your mom said you'd like it here. Didn't she also say to get veal? Well, they didn't have any. Oh, look at this. Pop Rocks. Those are nasty. What are you talking about? You used to love these things. Yeah, when I was like ten. - Come on, Dad. - Hey, you know what? Add those. All right. Comes to 58 dollars and six cents. That is 60. Keep the change. Thank you. Oh, here, you got it. Dad, you okay? Um. Did that old guy seem odd to you? No, I don't think so. Why? Maybe there's somewhere closer to the house we can shop. Oh, I don't mind if we have to come back here. - Dad. - Yeah? - I got a weird question. - Shoot. Is everything okay with you and Mom? Okay in what way? Don't do that. - Don't... - Don't deflect. That's what Mom does. Can you just be honest? Marriage is really hard work. And sometimes, it doesn't go in the direction you hoped. - Are you guys getting a divorce? - No. - No. No, no, no. - Don't have to freak out. - It's fine. I don't care. - Who's freaking out? It's just, like, all my friends' parents are divorced. - Listen. - It's not a big deal. - I... - Let's not think like that, okay? Well... ...I love you both. - I just want you to know. - Good. You know, sometimes I think to myself, "How did I get such a wise daughter?" And then I think, "Wow, she probably has a really wise dad." Oh, I don't know about that. Get out. Maybe Toby needs a friend. That'd be awesome. - Mom? - Jess? Mom? Jess? Mom? This... this fucking thing won't open. Language. - Door won't open? - No, a manhole cover in Lower Manhattan. Yes, the door. I have to get inside for the virtual tour. But don't you have a key? Yeah, to the house, the... the pool shed, the mailbox, but not for this door. Jess, let... let me help. Let me give it a shot. Okay. Yeah, that thing's not opening. - Yeah. - Do you want me to kick it down? Hmm. Not yet. Did you get the veal? They didn't have any. So, what did you get instead? Burger meat for grilling. Let me see something. No sunlight gets in. That's weird. This room wasn't on the blueprint. I... I think it's, like, a storage room or maybe a... a panic room. Freaky. I'll get it. Can I help you? Yeah. So you're Anna's mom. Who's asking? Oh, I'm Isaac. I'm... I'm a friend. A friend of Anna's? I met her at my grandpappy's grocery store today. Uh-huh. And? Well, I was just stopping to invite you and your family to dinner. We're your nearest neighbors, just a few miles that way. That's very sweet of you, Isaac. Um. I'm sorry, we have other plans. We're on a family vacation. I'm sure you understand. I do. I do. But if you change your mind, we're having veal cutlets tonight. We got a lot in at the store. Veal cutlets, at your store? Yes, ma'am. W... we got a huge shipment in yesterday. They're on display. No one could miss 'em. Give me your address, Isaac. On second thought, we would love to join you. I'm telling you, I didn't see it. Or maybe he's lying about the stupid cutlets. He's not lying. You are. Why would you trust some stranger over me? I didn't wanna say anything... but the old man at the store... - he wrote this on my receipt. - Hmm. "You're being watched by the devil." - He's probably making a joke or... - I don't wanna have dinner with some creepy locals just so you can prove a point. Well... ...neither do I. Okay, then. Would you knock this stuff off? - Come on. You are beautiful. - What is wrong with you? Why couldn't you buy the veal like I asked? - I am telling you, I didn't see it. - Sure you did. But you hate veal, so you didn't buy it. Because you do exactly what you want and damn the consequences. You're not just talking about veal. Wow, what a genius you are. You know, Anna hates veal too. But you never think about her. She's all I think about. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think she would be very surprised to hear that. So, now, I'm a bad parent? Not you? N... not the cheater. Never you. No, no, no. You're the nice one and I'm the asshole. Isn't that right? Isn't that how you try to manipulate Anna into seeing us? I'm not gonna stay here and get emotionally abused. Then go to your whore. You know, at least she made me feel good about myself. You make me feel like slitting my wrists. Then fucking do it. You... ...broke my heart. Oh, my God. I loved you. I love you. - I'm your wife. - I know. How could you treat me like this? How can you do this to us? You're right. I am sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. Did you end things with that woman? Yes. It's over between me and Vivienne. Do you swear it? On Anna's life. Because this is why... - I brought us here. - I... I didn't want you to sneak off to go see her. I... I wanted you to give us a chance to rebuild. I'm gonna get help. I just... Oh, my God. It's hard to trust you. You just keep hurting me... over and over. I'm so sorry. I want things to be like they used to. Mm-hmm. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Mom! Dad! Wow. - Are you okay, hon? - Yeah. I think it's finally stopping. You know, it happens when she gets stressed. How do I look? Like a supermodel who got punched in the nose. At least we have a reason to stay home tonight. - Yeah, well, that boy didn't give me a number to call and cancel. - His name is Isaac. - Who cares if we don't call and cancel? - His name's Isaac. We can't just stand him... ...and his grandfather up, especially if they're cooking a meal. - Okay, well... - Like, what if they mess with the house when we leave? I'll go to the store in the morning and apologize. I don't want Isaac to see me with a bloody nose, Mom. - I know, honey. - What if it happens again? - Okay. - We can have a nice dinner. Just the three of us. Oh. One minute! Hi there, Anna's Mom and Dad. - What are you doing here? - I'm real sorry. I... I know you were supposed to come to our place, but the strangest thing happened. - What's that? - Our oven died. - Seriously? - Yeah. So, we did the next best thing. We just brought the food over here to cook for you. It's... it's in the truck with my grandpappy. Hmm. Uh. Veal cutlets, onions, carrots, grits. Grandpappy sure can cook. Uh. We even brought a bottle of wine. It... it's just how we do things on the bayou. - Hmm. - So, can we come in? Uh. We'll even do dishes. Ye... yes, uh, of course you can. Hey, Grandpappy, they said it's okay to come in! Great. Come on in. Thanks for cooking. It's no big deal. My name's John. You know, about that note you wrote me, the one on the receipt. I remember. What did you mean by that? Get me a measuring cup. The little one. Sometimes... when a man does bad things, it opens up a door. I don't understand. Are you sure? The devil is watching us all the time. Some of us invite him in. Some don't. I felt you needed to hear those words, but... didn't want to say 'em in front of your daughter. Well, no offense, but I don't believe in the devil. The devil believes in you. Thanks. I appreciate that. His name's Toby. We call him Tub Tub. He likes you. Cats can sense things people can't. Come on, Tub Tub. Yeah, there you go. Is that thing on? No. So, you were saying it's just you and your grandfather out here? Yes, ma'am. My parents died some time ago. He raised me as his own. - How'd your parents die? - Anna. Don't. It's rude. It's fine. I would be curious too. Uh. They died of bone cancer. - Both of them? - Yes, ma'am. Grandpappy says bone cancer's the most painful way to die. But he says a lot of crazy things. He's a wild one. What are the schools like around here? Why? Are you wanting to move here with Anna? No. I wouldn't know much about schools. Grandpappy taught me everything I know. But I'm gonna run the store one day. That's so cool. You really think so? Yeah. I... I like your shirt. It matches your eyes. How old are you, Isaac? Eighteen. I'm trying to grow a beard. Hmm. Who owns this house? Do you know? I don't know much about 'em. They're never really here. Really? But being your closest neighbor, I'd think you'd know. Hey, everybody, dinner is almost ready and it looks delicious. This is great. You are one hell of a cook. There's nothing my grandpappy can't do. I bet your mom's a hell of a cook too. Um. - She's, uh... - No. That's okay, sweetie. Uh. Cooking isn't my forte. It's just, I never got interested in it. Out here, cooking isn't an interest. It's a necessity. We don't have restaurants for miles. You don't cook, you don't eat. I know how to cook, Isaac. It's just, uh, not a passion of mine. Hmm. Everyone's got their passion. Would you mind if I light some candles? No, uh... that would be nice. - Isaac. - Yes, ma'am. How did you know where the candles are? Lucky guess. I'll be. I guess cats aren't the only ones who can sense things. Pretty funny thing to say, huh, Grandpappy? Gosh, you know... ...uh, I don't have any matches. Oh, um... ...I'll find some in the kitchen. John, come help me look. I want these people out of the house. Look. Listen, they're weird, but they haven't done anything wrong exactly. That creepy boy is looking at Anna in a way I don't like. - Right. - And how did he know where the candles are? Okay, listen, we will finish dinner and then we will tell them we're going to bed. Can't we get them out faster? Hey, You're the one that said we shouldn't piss them off. Fine. I... I want them gone the minute we finish eating. I don't want Anna alone with them. Oh, shit, uh, we forgot the matches. Here, come on. I'll tell them we couldn't find 'em. Mom, Dad, Isaac just did something really cool. - What, he found matches? - No, he touched the candles with his finger and they just lit up. Can you do that trick again? Oh, I'll show you a lot more tricks, Anna. Isaac, um, John and I were talking and we're grateful for the meal, but we're really tired after the drive and we're going to bed early, right after dinner. And I... I just wanted you and your grandpa to know. Wow, Grandpappy. You hear that? They're inviting us to stay the night. - No, I... I... I... - We're touched, ma'am. No one's ever invited us to stay in a house like this before. I... I'm not inviting you to stay the night. I'm... I'm saying that you have to leave after dinner, if not sooner. But we brought ice cream for dessert. Well, we'll eat it when you're gone. Oh, come on. What did we do? I know there's enough room in this house for all of us. Six bedrooms, if I'm not mistaken. That's not counting the game room or the bonus room... or even that locked room you can't get into. How do you know about the locked room? How do you think? You've been in this house before. Oh, girl, you got a gusher. Mom, I don't feel good. - Oh! - Oh, my God. - Whoa. Come on. Anna, Anna. - Oh. Get her. Oh, for Christ sakes. I gotta use your pisser. - Anna. - Hey, baby? - Let's get her in the living room, okay? - Okay. Anna. - Wake up. Wake up. - Wake up. Wake up. Hey. Hey. Hey, are you okay? Are you okay? Hey, sweetie. - Can you hear my voice? - Can you hear me? - Your mom's here. I'm here. - You're okay. Mom. What happ... what happened? You fainted. You had another nosebleed. I have to wash my face. Oh, it's fine. I've seen blood before. - Much more than that. - You need to leave. I'm not sure you want that, ma'am. She's very sure. Our daughter isn't feeling well. Dad, I'm fine. - No, hey. Isaac... - No, you're not. ...enough is enough. Come on. It can take Grandpappy a little bit. Sometimes he gets the squirts. - Then go wait in the truck. - Mom. - It's okay. - Wow. I feel like your cat's the only one that likes me here. You cook veal cutlets for strangers and this is the thanks you get? You like me though, don't you, Anna? I can tell. - The way a woman likes a man. - Stop it! You're done here, Isaac. Get out. I knew you'd have problems getting into that locked room. It's the only key. I think my grandpappy's tangling with your cat. Toby? Wait. Wait. Toby. - Toby! Toby! - What the hell is going on in here? - Did you hurt our cat? - No! - Open the door. - I was just looking for the bathroom. - That door was open. - Toby! - The cat ran inside. - Toby. Now, I may have closed it by accident. You're lying. This door has been locked the entire time. Grandpappy never lies. - Toby. Toby. - Wait, you have a key to the room too? Toby, Toby, Toby! Give me the key. Give it to me. - Toby! Toby! - Give me the fucking key! - This key? - Yeah! - Just give it to me. - Jesus. Grandpappy, he's hurting me. See, John? - Told you I'd show you some tricks. - Huh? What's going on? Good thing we have candles. Anna, honey, are you okay? Take your grandson and get out of here. - He's not my grandson. - What? What do you mean, he's not your grandson? I mean, he's not my grandson. All right. All right, you know what? Just give me the key. We're gonna take our cat and I'm gonna call the police. - Something's hurting Toby, Dad! - Okay, calm down. - Something's hurting him! - Calm down. Do something, Dad. Can't just open it up. Toby. Oh, my God. Is Toby dead? Listen, give me the key! Check your back pocket. Jesus Christ. I'll be. - I'm opening it. - No, no, no. Stop, stop! - John, John, John, please. You have to stop. - I'm opening the door. - Please stop. We heard... - I'm opening the door. - There's something in there. - Mom, - Toby's in there! - There is something... I know, but there is something else in there. - We all heard it. Please don't... - Could be a coyote went in there, you know, when the door opened. Oh, coyote. Now, that is bad news for Tub Tub. No, no. Enough's enough! - I'm opening the damn door! - No, please don't! - Don't open the door. - Back off! Are you out of your mind? Please, John, let's... - Come on! - Let us go. - Let's go. - Open the door. Dad, open the door. Damn, I must have brought the wrong key. Can we go, please? - Can we go? Oh, my God. - Mom, we can't go! We can't just leave Toby, Mom! Listen to me. It's a cat. We will buy another cat. We will. Grandpappy, did you find that bathroom? - We have to get out of here. - Yeah. Through there. Of course. I remember now. Uh. Sorry about your cat. Fuck you. Listen, you need to come with me. We need to talk before Isaac gets back. Follow me. Come here. Come here. We have to go. We have to go. So, are you robbing us? Is that what's going on? You ain't got nothing we need or want. Then why are you here? Like I told him... when a man does bad things, it opens up a door. You are nuts and so is that kid. Bad things? Bad things like what? Like lying. Cheating. Murder. - Ain't you read your Bible? - Oh, God. In the store, Isaac was so nice to me. He said I looked like his ex-girlfriend. Now, he's being so mean. Yeah, well... ...that's Isaac in a nutshell. If Isaac isn't your grandson, then who is he? He just sort of appeared one summer. Walked right out of the bayou. Said his parents had died, left him a bunch of money. Never even told me his last name. But he didn't have no place to live. Didn't have no possessions. So I kinda, sorta, took him in. - You took him in? - Stop! I'm not done talking. He ain't got no education... but he's got a good Christian spirit. I... I guess I'm his helpmate, so to speak. Oh, God. How long has he lived with you? It's hard telling. You lose track of time out on the bayou. Few years, maybe. Maybe decades. There's no way. Thing is... he don't never seem to get any older. He's good with those damn magic tricks, though, isn't he? But he always looks the same to me. Maybe 18 or so. - This is bullshit. - Just let him talk. - No, it's bullshit! - Let him talk! I'd like to put some music on. Make sure Isaac can't hear. I got something else to tell you. So, what are you telling me? You telling me that she found out about us? I wasn't careful enough. I was so stupid about it. Yes, she followed me, okay? I just found out about it. - She could be watching us right now. - Well, that ain't the song - I was looking for. - I can't believe she knows. She's dragging me on a trip with Anna. I... - What is this? Wh... what is this? - God, I fucked this up. - It's gonna be okay. - I'm telling you, she is vicious. You have no idea. I have to be more careful from now on. Everything will be different when I get back, Vivienne. I will file the divorce papers, and we can start our new life together. - No, no, no, no! - Yes, yes. - No. - Yes. - Come on. - It's okay. Jessica, please. - I don't know what's going on right now. - I love you so much. I love you more. How did you get that? - I think it's one of Isaac's magic tricks. - Listen. Fuck your magic. Was that real? That was real. That was real. So, you've been seeing Vivienne. Yeah? Yeah? And you... you... you're going to... to... you're going to divorce me? I... No. I said that to her, but I didn't mean it. My God. You've been playing both of us this entire time and you've been lying to me. I can't believe this. No, hey, listen, don't get emotional. I can get however I want. - Not in front of Anna. - Not in front of Anna? You're a piece of shit. Dad, are you leaving me and Mom? I'm gonna kill you. Look. Greatest Hits of Gene Allison. See? No. You're a liar and so is that boy. You're doing this to mess with me. Anna and I are gonna leave right now. - Please don't. - You... you're disgusting. - Please don't. - You see this? Go to hell. Yeah, I'm divorcing you now. We're done. - Listen to me... - I'm out. ...Jessica! - Come on. I want you to get up. Get up. - No, you can't leave Dad. - Jessica! - I'm out. Hey, guys. What'd I miss? Toby? Oh, my God. Wait. I figured it out. Other than Anna... you're all in on this, aren't you? - In on what? - In on this. You're all working together, aren't you? You and the old man, both have keys to the locked room. And you, you already know these people and you paid them. You set me up and taped me somehow and now, you're getting your sick revenge. You don't want to rebuild our marriage. You want revenge. - You're crazy. - You know, I knew you were vicious I knew it, but I didn't know you were a psychopath. How could you do this to Anna? I've never met these people before in my life. I'm calling the police on you. - Call them. Call them right now. - Wait, wait. Who took my phone? - Where is my phone? - Stop, Dad! Stop! Maybe it was Vivienne. Maybe... maybe she's the one that set you up. Did you ever think about that? And you're a lying, cheating asshole and she's probably exactly like you. You're the one who followed me, who stalked me. Exactly. What if she's doing the same thing? Please stop! Before you played that... record... what were you going to say? I was gonna tell you that there's something you need to see in that locked room. - Holy shit! - What? Someone's out there. Where? I saw something by the water. Could be a coyote. Yeah, could be. Or maybe a wolf. Even a wild dog. There! - I don't see it. Where are you looking? - No, I saw it. I saw it too. Probably just a coyote. Or a wolf. Better to be safe though. Good thing this gun's still here. Whoa. Don't worry. If you're righteous, you'll survive. - Just be careful, please. - Wait. How's this camera work? Look, Grandpappy. I'm a movie star. Don't put me on that. Isaac. Isaac, what is it that you want? I want you to take real good care of this camera. I'm gonna be famous one day. Just like Charles Manson. You know, you hear about God's son. Does Satan have a son? Food for thought. Please put that gun down. - Let's go outside, John. - No. - Why not? - Because you're gonna shoot me. Shoot you? - ♪ Tell me the truth... ♪ - I thought we were gonna go hunt coyotes. We can talk about this. Can we talk about this, please? Will you please put that gun down? - Please? - Jessica. Fine. I'll leave the gun with Grandpappy. You can stay here with your wife and your daughter. ♪ If you will only Tell me the truth ♪ Okay, John. No gun. - ♪ Whoa... - Let's go for that walk. - John. - No, Dad. Dad. Just stay here. It'll be all right. - Don't go. - It's okay. - Don't go, Dad. Don't go. - I know. I know. It's okay. ♪ And I just don't understand ♪ ♪ Why don't you tell me The truth ♪ Oh, come on, little girlie. You don't gotta be frightened. I'm not the bogeyman. ♪ That I'm willing To let you go ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Without your love ♪ This wasn't the deal we made. No, listen, all you have to do is rob us and shoot Jessica. What the fuck are you doing in there? What the fuck are you pushing me for? How did you get that recording of me and Vivienne? - Oh, magic. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I have to look squeaky-clean and you have to be believable for Anna's sake. Oh, I'm not believable? They don't know I'm 21, that... that I was in the army. But you keep fucking up my plan. I'm fucking up? I'm not the one trying to murder my wife. Don't say that. - Murder? Murder. - Don't say that. - Don't say that. - You don't like that word. - Murder. Murder. - Don't say that. Don't say that. Don't say that. Don't say that, Isaac. Get off of me. This was the perfect plan. I knew that she would drag me here. She babbled about this stupid house nonstop. I spent so long strategizing and finding you. Yeah. It's not easy finding a killer for hire. You gotta visit some pretty dark places. I'm not gonna pay you if this thing goes sideways. Oh. Yeah, 'cause you'll be in jail. Well, so will you. Along with that crazy, old man you work with. He's never gonna see daylight again. You're gonna see the electric chair, bub. You're the mastermind here. We're just country folk. What happened to our cat in that locked room? Maybe a coyote killed him and I brought him back to life. This is what I'm talking about. You quit scaring people with this voodoo shit and do your job. This is my job. Okay. Keep the train on the tracks and you'll get your 100 grand. Then you can take the car to Mexico, like we planned. I feel like you're trying to control me. You want your wife gone, you want a good story for your kid, for the cops and your shiny, new girlfriend. That takes work. That takes trust. Are you sure you want to go through with this? We can call this whole thing off right now. No, we are doing it, but from now on, play by the rules. - Okay. - Okay. So go in there, rob us, and when we're walking back to the locked room, you shoot Jessica in the head and then you get the fuck out. Okay. They've been gone so long now. I could put some music on again. No. No, it's okay. What... What's... what's your real name? Grandpappy's fine. Grandpappy. Grandpappy. I wanna ask you something. Yeah? I think there's something wrong with Isaac. I think that he is... evil, and he wants to hurt people. Yeah, some days, I think that too. - But you're not like him. - Hmm. Not from what I can tell. So... I'd like to make a proposition. - A proposition? - Yes. Let me and my daughter go. We'll sneak out. Isaac won't see us. We'll get in our car and drive away. What about Dad? Quiet. You'll go to the police. I'll tell them that you're innocent. I'll say that you're a hostage just like us. But I have a gun. Well, I think Isaac is making you do this. I know he is. I can't turn my back on him. If you let us go, I will... I will give you everything I have. Mom, what about Dad? We can't just leave him here to die. Hush. They're almost back. Oh, shit. I can't believe you wanted to leave Dad. Don't tell him I said that. We didn't see any coyotes. But we did some talking. Ma'am, your husband's right. We're robbing you. Me and Grandpappy are gonna lock you in that room. See, we've been sneaking in this house for a few weeks now. Thought you were the new owners. Just bad luck, really. Like bone cancer. You're gonna lock us in the room? Yes, ma'am. After we take your money and your SUV. - That was their plan all along. - But we'll die if you lock us up. How... how will we get out? We'll call the police, leave an anonymous tip. I'll leave some food and water in there for you. Thank you. I trust them. You're a fucking idiot. They are not gonna call the police. My daughter is 14 years old. Please, I'm... I'm asking you, please don't do this. - Ma'am, you have my word. - Your word? - Your word doesn't mean anything. - Calm down, okay? Your word means even less. Why the fuck would I calm down? Jess. It's the room or a bullet. It's okay. Time's wasting. What is this place? Why are you doing this? - Why are you doing this? - I think we just have to put our differences aside... ...and do what they... Don't talk to me! You first, John. Me? - It's okay. - Dad. - Go on. - No. - No. No. - All right. Dad. Come on. Isaac? Isaac, what are you doing? I'm putting you where you belong, John. Isaac, let me out. John... Isaac. - Let me out. - Hey, John? Murder. Let me out, Isaac. Isaac... Isaac... Isaac... I'm gonna kill you! Isaac, open the door! Open the door! I'm gonna fucking tear you apart. See, ma'am, I'm guessing he's cheated on you many a times before with many different women. But you always take him back, don't you? - What is he talking about? - I... I... I don't... I don't know. Anna... Hey, baby. Don't listen to Isaac. Don't listen to him. Isaac! What do you think you're doing? You've been in denial about your husband for a long time now. - Anna! Let me out! - It's time you face the truth. Better go get that. - Don't worry. - Isaac... Me and Grandpappy will stay right here with Anna. No. No. No, Mom, you can't leave me. No, you can't leave, Mom. - Mom. - You dirty motherfucker! Isaac! Open the door. Open the door! Open this fucking door! Anna? Anna. Baby, don't listen to what he says, baby. Listen, he's a liar. If he says anything about me, you know he's lying, okay? Okay? Same with your mother! Same with your fucking mother! You. Oh, my God. You're his wife. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I... I got a text. From my husband? Yes. You knew he was married? You're as bad as he is. I'm really, really sorry. I am. He... he told me that he was here all alone here, that he needed me to come right away. See? I drove as fast as I could. - My husband didn't text you that. - What? This house is being robbed. The men are still inside. They have John locked up. - Are you serious? - Yes. My daughter's inside too. They took John's phone and texted you to lure you here. - Why? - To hurt you. They're crazy. - They have a gun. - Okay, well... well, I'll help however you need, okay? - I'll... I'll call the police. - No, phones don't work. Do you have anything I can use as a weapon? I don't know, a knife? - Mace. Mace. - Give it to me. Give it to me. - Okay. - You need to go to the police. Tell them that we are being held at gunpoint. There's an old man and a teenage boy. Is John okay? Anna? Do not use my daughter's name. You disgust me. - I actually came here to break up with John. - I don't give a shit. - You can have him. - He told me all of this... Shut up. From now on, my family is me and my daughter. If you don't come back here with the police and I survive... I swear, I will find you and I will kill you. I'll get help. I swear. - Go. - Okay. No, don't do this. They're taking too long. Take Anna out and get the gasoline. Anna! Dad! Dad! Anna! Isaac, you betrayed me. - You betrayed me! - You betrayed your own family. I'm gonna bury every cent of that money. You're not gonna see anything. You're not gonna see anything! You really think I was in this for the money? Put the key in, Isaac. Put the key in! Put the key in, Isaac! Let me out! Open the fucking door! Isaac. Isaac! - Open the door! - Check the closet, John. It's your only way out. Open that closet fast, John. Come on. Shit. - Oh, my God. - Try it again. - I'm trying. - Try it again, Vivienne. Okay. - Oh, my God. - Vivienne. The doors won't open. - What is happening? - I'm trapped! Jessica. - Look out. - Mom. Grandpappy's making me do this. Stop. Right there. It's a fine night for a bonfire, don't you think? That's what Isaac says. We called the police on you. - They're on their way. - Now, you know that's not true. Isaac's controlling this, isn't he? But why? Maybe he didn't have nothing better to do. It's so heavy, Mom. I can't hold it anymore. You start pouring that gasoline on the car. - There's a woman inside. - That woman is no good. - You know what? her and your dad... - Hey. Don't say it. Why? You trying to protect his good name? I'm protecting my daughter. Anna... start pouring that gas or I'm gonna shoot your mama. You do it yourself. You don't make my child do it. That's not how this works. Don't. Don't! Don't! - Don't. Stop it, please! - No. Hey. Go back. I'll do it. - No! - Good. No. - Don't! - Anna, shut your eyes. Mom. No, Jessica! No! - Make sure you get some under the hood. - I'm sorry! No, Jessica! Oh, my God! No, Jessica, please! - Jessica, no! - I'm so fucking sorry. No! No! Jessica! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Jessica! Please! Stop! Jessica! Please! Stop! No! - Don't do it! No! - Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. No, Jessica! Oh, my God! Just like cooking veal. Oh, my God. Please, Jessica, no! Help me! No! No! - Anna, run! - Jessica! No! Motherfucker! - Anna! - Mom! Oh, God. Vivienne. Vivienne. Oh, God, Vivienne. Oh, my God! Shit. Vivienne! Fuck! Honey, no, it's okay. Come here, Anna. Anna, look at me. Look at me. Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay. All right. Honey. Oh, God. - No keys. Shit, shit, shit. - Isaac has all the keys. Oh, Dad has the other key. Honey, honey, you have to stay. - Okay, listen to me. - What? If you see Isaac, - you're gonna scream... - No. - ...and then you shoot him. - No, no, no. - Mom, I can't do this. - You can do this. - You can't... I can't do this. - You're gonna do this. Listen to me. You're gonna aim and you're gonna shoot and I'll come running. You're gonna aim at his eyes, okay? - Listen to me. - I can't do this, Mom! Listen to me. If I don't try to save your dad, you will never forgive me. Okay. Okay. Mom, what are you gonna do? Take this. It's Mace. I'm gonna find Isaac. Isaac? Isaac. Grandpappy needs you. He's hurt real bad. John? Hello? John? John? John. Jess... Is Anna okay? She's fine. Isaac said that Vivienne is here... ...and they killed her. No. Vivienne's... Vivienne's alive. She's... she's waiting for you. John, do you have the car keys? Isaac took them. Jessica... tell Vivienne I love her. I will. Hey. Mom! Don't come any closer. - Or what? - Or I'll shoot you. Mom, it's Isaac! Mom! You ever even shot a gun before? Did you hurt my dad? You're so pretty when you cry. You're such a good girl, Anna. So sweet and pure in your nature. Stop it. Stop talking. I know what you're going through. I've been there too. You deserve better than your parents. You deserve love. My parents love me. Treat you like an afterbirth. That's not true. That's not true! You want to go for a ride with me? No. But you don't even know where I'm headed. I can show you things you can't even dream of. Got a little boat tied up out back. Grandpappy didn't even know about it. We can disappear into the bayou. No one will ever see us again. I don't make this offer to many girls. It's a rare gem of an offer. Just like you. A rare gem. Anna! Mom! Let her go! Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Can't do that, ma'am. See, I'm thinking about taking your daughter here as my wife. Hardly seen a prettier girl. You'll go to hell for what you've done. Been there already. Not much to see compared to Earth. Anna, stay strong. You know why this happened, don't you? See, your husband hired me and Grandpappy to kill you. That's not true. Oh, sure it is. See, he thought we were just country folk. Didn't understand the nature of the beast. Truth is John's the one who needed to be killed. Not you. Or your lovely, little Anna. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! No! Don't hurt my mom. Hey, hey. Hey. Hold on. Let's talk about this. If you're righteous, you'll survive. I was just joshing about marrying your daughter. From where I sit, marriage is just a pit of spikes. Who the hell are you? I see myself as a moral compass. People spin in the wrong direction, I set 'em straight. Me and the old man built this house for people just like your husband. Murderers, liars, cheaters and sinners are all alike. They're drawn to it like a magnet. It's my task to kill 'em. You're insane. I've been alive for centuries. Maybe I'm a demon. Or maybe I'm an angel. Or just a really confused kid. Here. Take 'em. Anna. Honey, Isaac's dying. - I'm fucking scared, Mom. - We have to go. Go. Go! We have to go. Everything's gonna be okay. Run. Run! Run. Run. Run. Thank God. Check your phone. Check your phone right now, please. Do you have a signal? I don't have any. Why isn't it working, Mom? It's not working. Did Isaac hurt you? Did he... did he touch you? - No. - No? We left Dad there, Mom. We have to go back. What about Dad, Mom? - What about... what about Dad? - What about Dad? Listen to me. We're safe. That's what matters. That we're safe right now. We're safe. And I keep telling you, there are no houses out there. Not like the one you described. Yeah, something went wrong with my phone and my computer and the pictures aren't there anymore. It's not like I don't believe you. We were inside that house. I was the real estate agent. The house is real and we need to find it and my husband. And we need to find Isaac and... and the old man. - It's easy to get confused on the bayou. - We're not confused. Isaac tried to kill us. And my dad is dead. Like I said, deputies will be dispatched. Listen, I don't know what really went on between you and your husband, but if he's out there, we'll find him. He's probably just disoriented. He may still be alive. You haven't heard a word I said. I heard you, but you're not making any sense. Take me to this address. I wanna to see it myself. There are no homes around here. It's just swamp. I'm ready when you are. And my daughter's gonna stay here in the station. Mom... It's safer if I leave you here. Like you left Dad? Is he safe? I promise, I will be back in a couple hours. I swear, there was a house. It was... it was a big house. Uh. And there was a fire in... in the driveway. Where? It was there. It was... it was... it was right here. Like I said, it's easy to get confused. I... I'm not confused. I'm not. Then you tell me, are we at the wrong place? No. I don't know. Look, I'm happy to take you somewhere else, within reason. It happened here. You're right. There's nothing here. There's no house. I'm sorry, ma'am. Take me back to the station. You know, to be honest, you're not the first person to come to me with a crazy story about a house. Can you drive faster, please? First, I need you to do me a favor. - What? - Open the glove compartment. Oh, my God. But this was in the house. How did you get it? That means we have Isaac on tape. Turn it on. We're right behind you, ma'am. Oh, my God. Turn this off. It's on all the stations. That's not... This can't be happening. ♪ Tell me the truth ♪ ♪ Please stop me from guessing ♪ ♪ Darling, it will be A blessing ♪ ♪ If you will only Tell me the truth ♪ It was... them. Take a breath. It's not real. No, it can't be. Isaac and Grandpappy help us keep order. I don't know what they are. They're not human. You're crazy. We protect Isaac, and he takes care of the evildoers. Like a spider catching flies. He sends them straight to hell. It's an illusion. Tell yourself that. The bayou plays a lot of tricks. I'm gonna tell everyone what happened. Who would believe you? Isaac doesn't hurt the righteous, only the wicked. But I'm not wicked. It's a matter of degrees. Heaven and hell are a choice away. Isaac gave you a second chance. Embrace it. Be kind. And never come back to the house on the bayou. - Anna? - Mom. Anna. Oh, thank God. It's okay. I love you. Oh, honey. I'm never leaving you again.
