Sun-hwa? Sun-hwa! What is it? Dear. I hear your voice from in there. You said not to tell anyone you were bathing here. Dear. Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here. But, Sun-hwa. I said don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here. Dear? Why did you tell? CHAPTER 3: SELLER OF GOODS Halo? You live in Gwang-Lim's mansion, right? What happened to you there? GOODS STAY RIGHT AWAY - What are you doing? - Work. You're not working, sir. You remember the unit you rented last week? The new tenant says different to what you say. Of course. And that grandma, you rented out three bedrooms last month... ...says it has a lien for it. His grandson phone complained many times about the deposit he gave. What housing? What do you think? That's not selling the house, but marketing it. - Ever been on a blind date? - Yes. Have you ever? You know what he was like before you met? No. So what? You're just guessing. You don't know what he likes. Who chooses? The client himself. But our job is to choose the best and show them. What should I do with you? You have to market it that it's the best. Why do people dress well and stuff before going on a blind date? To show his kindness... ... and cover up the ugliness as best you can. It is common. Where are you going? Blind date. You are not my friend. Waterways! It's very nice here, sir. You have to see it. Maybe it will gush at you. Making a living is hard. Honey, I'm home. I am hungry. Isn't it cold today? Very delicious. It turns out that kimchi is delicious. Today's customer is an author. He went around and inspected the place carefully. Then he said, "You're not my friend." What's wrong with calling him a friend? Okay. I almost forgot. Wait a minute. Then! Then! I found it on my way. It took me a long time to pick it up. You look gloomy. I'll put it on you. Dear. I already called headquarters. If they don't fix it this time, I'll sue them. You don't have to come over and over like that time. Already. Do not worry. Unlucky! Do you have female friends? What? No. Maybe that's how it is. Why are you asking that? Look at this. This is women's hair. I have worked in this field for more than 10 years. Sometimes they wash their hair here in winter... ...because the bathroom was cold. It is not easily destroyed. This becomes a stopper. It will be destroyed the right way. What are you talking about? And who washes their hair in the sink these days? I'm the expert here. You must have just moved. If not you, it must be the previous occupant. I'll try to get it out by hand. If that fails, I'll have to go and get a rubber suction cup. Tool with per in it. I had to roll it up and push it a few feet in. I have to keep pushing it. If it still fails? So I had to go to the bottom unit to cut the roof and get into the pipe. So how much does it cost? The cost is a little expensive. Isn't it okay to see other people's personal data? I have to pay 500 dollars in repairs. I wonder who lives there. And after you know? Asking for a refund. But, sir. You live in the Gwang-Lim mansion, right? - I heard rumors about that place. - What? Cancelled. LEE JI-YEUN Could. Hello. I'm from Right Away Realty. Halo? Halo? Halo? Yes. He's wrapped up. I'll send it tomorrow morning. Can you make sure to fix it properly this time? Don't make him go back and forth like that time. He is very valuable. You know that. Thank you. Please take good care of him. Until found. Unlucky. The person and the tool. Why not just pour in some liquid and just dry it? Where's my cell phone? Do you know what a black hole is? Yes, why? Could it be in the house? Just forget it. Where might it be in the house ... Sir, I'm feeling worried. I heard that the high school girl died in Gwang-Lim's big house. It might happen. Not that. Many people died and disappeared in that place. I heard it was built by Gwang-Lim Church. His followers believe his leader died and committed suicide. What are you reporting? You already know, right? It is a place of worship. Do you think I made a mistake? Such a thing does not happen in a perfect home. I'm just doing my job. What? Is that a curse? I'm just marketing the place! Why are you looking at me? What? Sorry for messing up when we first met. I just want to get to know you better. Have a drink. Tos. So you moved and lived here? Gwang-Lim Church. Gwang-Lim Church? I got cursed because of those crazy followers. The curse will spread to the others as well. What else? What's up with Gwang-Lim Church? I'm just marketing it. That's all I did. Sir. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm just marketing it. That's all I did. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm just marketing it. It's not my fault. I'm just marketing it. It's not my fault. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. SCARY HORROR CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS Ji-woo. Yes. You know your last work failed? Because it's not pictured like this. Why didn't you draw like this in the first place? It's better than your last work. - So, we agree? - Yes. But... It's too short. This is not a short story. Make it longer. I'll send you a deposit now. Do not give it to another publisher. Make it a long story. You sure can. I know you can. - So you're going back there? - Yes. Did you forget what day it is? It's your birthday! Really? Take a break today. You've worked too hard. Look, there are dark circles under your eyes. I mean it doesn't look bad. - I'll call you. - Listen first. Please, just rest today. You'll get a web cartoon deal. Can't you appreciate yourself a little? And also... - Cut the cake with me. - Da-hae... Can you go? You need another story? Yes, as much as possible. Okay. There's nothing more I can tell you. Sorry? Sir, I will pay you. Tell me. I'll give you what you want. It happened on the sixth floor. There is a young man. He returned after studying abroad. He failed college and came back again. Jae-seok. He didn't know where to go. Only his little friend asked for help. Jae-seok? Halo! Jae-seok! THEIR PRAYERS BLESS THE SERVANTS OF THIS HOUSE Tae-hoon! Jae-seok. How are you, man? I'm not a guest. Why spend that much? Now that you're back, you should eat kimchi. I also eat kimchi there. Do you clean often? Busy? No. What's your occupation? I? I'm studying for the civil service exam. Civil servant? Very noble. Glorious? I mean, that's great. You look cool after studying abroad. Cool? It's up to you, man. What's that? What? What's that on your face? Do not know. Sometimes I experience this. Is it contagious? If it's contagious, I'll let you know. You haven't changed. Thank you for letting me stay here. Two weeks at most. Others asked me to come, but I miss you. I miss you, man! You can stay longer. My parents allowed it. Your parents? Thanks the Food. I think the food is stale. WHY CAN'T I CALL YOU, BOY! Tae-hoon? You're awake? Not yet. Can I ask you something? Certain. You have lots of friends. Why did you come here? I told you, because I wanted to see you. You never came when we were at school. Is it true? Jae-seok. Doesn't it feel damp here? I saw mold growing in several places. If you're busy with work, I'll clean the house tomorrow. Sorry for the noise. No problem. I think this house is a little dirty. I'll be home at night. Just eat what's in the fridge. Okay. Unlucky! Just forget it. This is disgusting. Okay. - Give me anything. - Hello. You sell mildew remover? - I'm here first. - Forgive me. I don't like this place. Unlucky. You're home? You will fall ill living in a place like this. I clean it all day here. Hey! What is it? What do you think? It's clean now, right? - Because I live here too... - Hey! What are you doing?! How dare you! Why?! How dare you do this to my mother and father! Give them back! You're outrageous! YOUNG-JOON - Hello? - Hey, man! Young-joon! It's me. - Who's this? - It's me, Tae-hoon. Tae-hoon? Long time no see, man! Why didn't you read my message? I am busy. Are you in Korea? Certain! That's why I called. Can I come now? I miss you and want to know how you are. - Now? - Yes, now. But I'm with my lover. Do not lie! You don't have a boyfriend! Okay. Just come. Thanks, dude! I'll be there soon! Please provide your address. Halo? Halo? Tae-hoon. I'm sorry I was angry with you earlier. But my parents are also angry. You went overseas with my parents here. But since we're little friends... ...and you just came back from overseas... ...I explained everything to them. - Jae-seok. - So... Stay here with me. Help! Why do things like this keep happening? Is this place really cursed? Or Gwang-Lim Church ... What does that have to do with worship? I heard from a real estate seller... ...that this building... ...built by those cultists. What exactly? There are places that have been closed for a long time. Maybe you can find out a lot if you go there. Why do these things happen. Why don't you go and find out? You see for yourself.
