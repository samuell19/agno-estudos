(ominous music) (engine chugging) (ominous music) - [Female] Mr. Timmons, Carl Timmons? - Move on, this is a restricted property. - Hi, I'm Amelia Moore Mr. Timmons. - Oh yeah. You're the pest that leaves a dozen voicemails a day. - And since that didn't work I figured I'd drive out here myself. - Like I said, move on. (faint hissing) - You're the supervisor for this district, so this whole thing is your problem Mr. Timmons. And it's your responsibility to make it right. Now you can do that by getting me that report. - Now why would I do that? - Because I want the truth. You give me the truth and I'll protect you. - You got no idea lady. You got no clue what you're getting into. - Here's what I do know for sure Mr. Timmons. You lied. (ominous music) - I didn't think it was any big deal at the time. - Of course you didn't. You were used Carl. I know that. I can keep your identity protected. No one will ever know where I got my information. - Yeah right. They'll hound you lady. They're gonna wanna know... - Trust me Carl, I can protect you. Or it can destroy you. - [Carl] You threatening me? - Mr. Timmons, now why would I do that? - You think I don't know a threat when I hear one? (ominous music) Alright. I just hope you realize what you're getting yourself into here. (ominous music) (loud explosion) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Your inside buzz team has been working hard. We've been burning the midnight oil. We've been staying up way past our bedtime to dig out the truth for you our viewers and when we say dig, we mean really dig. We've been beating the bushes, we've left no rock unturned, we've even been thinking of bringing in the dynamite. Here's what we've got for you today. Sources close to Hollywood's most dazzling couple, you know who we mean kiddies. Those sources gave us the good old spin today. Hoping we'd just go away dizzy. Instead, we hit the usual haunts. And some pretty unusual haunts. Let's just say your Inside Buzz investigation is ongoing. We checked out their friends, their enemies, their nannies. Of course they want us to just give up and go away, but do you think we're gonna give up? Not a chance. We're not gonna stop until we get to the bottom of what's really behind these closed doors. Especially the bedroom doors. This is Laura Peterson and I'll be back tomorrow with more of the Inside Buzz. I think we need more cutaways just to get to give it a bit more weight. How 'bout some footage from the UNICEF fundraiser last month? You know the one where she cried her eyes out? (loud ringing) Oh, that's me. Laura Peterson. (solemn music) No. - Amelia would have been so touched to see you all here. Her family and friends, that was really, that was everything to her. (sobbing) I'm sorry. (slow paced music) - [Laura] Your dress is like the color of the sky too. I'll be right back okay. Professor Backaman. - Oh hello Laura. I didn't wanna interrupt. - It means a lot that you came professor. It's been years. - Oh please, we're both adults now, call me Meredith. My the years have been good to you. You look like you stepped right out of a magazine cover. I guess you have to working in television. - I couldn't have done any of it without you. - You were always headstrong and determined Laura. You wanted so desperately to be successful. - Well Amelia and I were gonna be the next great investigative reporting team. - That expose you two wrote on the Colleges Board of Trustees, you shook that campus to it's foundation. - It was you who inspired us. - It was a great piece of investigation journalism. Had either of you become a reporter you would have truly shaken up the world. - Well I am a reporter. - Oh. Yes, well I, of course. The Inside Buzz with Laura Peterson. I'd better let you get back to Rick and Amelia. How are they holding up? - Oh not well. I mean everyone's devastated. And there's a lot of confusion as to the facts which doesn't help. - You mean that fire wasn't an accident? - I don't know. I mean she'd had that car for years. Maybe the gas tank just got too old and it started to leak. They're still investigating. But why was she out there in the middle of nowhere? It just doesn't make any sense. - Yes, it's all very bizarre. Please give them my condolences. Best of luck with everything Laura. (ominous music) - Gloria finally dropped off. She kept asking me to sing these songs but I didn't know any of the words. - Amelia sings to her every night. - Do you need anything? - Oh you've done more than enough today Laura. Thank you. - Rick, we may not have seen each other that often the last few years, but Amelia was the closest thing I had to a sister. - So, did she tell you anything about what was going on? - What do you mean? - I don't know what I mean, that's the problem. She's been different lately. And there's this. I found it locked in her desk. And the police came through here like locust. I guess the husband is the first suspect. They took her computer and notebooks and stuff but, I hid this and I don't know why exactly. I just... There look, M.B., M.B., M.B., M.B.. Logged six times over the past three weeks. And then there's this one. Dinner, on the night I had to travel out of town for business. Amelia was keeping secrets from me, lying to me. I didn't want the police to see this and assume something. To think that she was... Because she wouldn't. Would she? - It's okay Rick. Amelia wasn't cheating on you, I promise. I know exactly who this M.B. is. - John there's a difference between an adjective and an adverb. Figure it out. Move up paragraph three, that's your opening. Proofread Christie proofread! How many times do I have to tell you people, print out and check. The eye skips right past errors on the screen. Who's going to trust a correspondent who makes grammar and spelling mistakes? - Not much has changed in the last eight years has it? - [Meredith] And to what do we owe this honor? - We had so little time to catch up. I was hoping we could talk. - I'd love to. Of course I can't right now. We've got an edition to put to bed. - I understand. Maybe after you've finished talking to the police you'll have more time. How can you lie to me?! - You never asked me if I'd seen Amelia. - Oh don't give me the run around Meredith. She met with you several times in the last month. M.B, M.B., it's why you went to the funeral! - I went to the funeral to grieve for an old student who also happened to be a friend. - Why were you meeting with her? - I still see many of my old students. At least the ones who haven't gone on to become actresses in Hollywood. - I'm not an actress I'm a reporter. - [Meredith] Oh is that what you call it? - People care for the stories I report. - Mmm, I'm sure the public's just dying to know which celebrity is back from rehab. Or what gown some ditzy starlet is wearing to the Academy Awards. But Laura, it's quite a stretch to call that journalism. - Well at least I'm still working. I didn't get fired from every paper I worked for. - I'd much rather be fired for fighting to uncover the truth than for wasting my talent on being a talking Barbie doll. - Oh you have no idea... You're misdirecting me. You're trying to control the interview. - At least you remember something I taught you. - What was Amelia doing? - She was working a story. - But she wasn't a reporter. She gave up her career when she got pregnant. - Amelia came to me a couple of months ago. She was feeling unfulfilled. - But her family... - Amelia loves her family, we both know that. But she was missing something. The passion, the excitement that comes from the chase. From exposing injustice and forcing the bureaucracy to do something about it. From uncovering the truth. - Is that the same lecture you gave her? - Serious journalism produces serious consequences. - Yeah I remember the mantra. You drilled it into us for four years. - And it'll probably be carved on my tombstone. Amelia wanted to feel that sense of fulfillment again. She wanted to find a story, something she believed in and rip into it. - Is that what she wanted or what you wanted? - Maybe both. - So what was she working on? It wasn't anything that could've gotten her killed was it? - I don't know. - Oh Meredith. - It was early days. She was gonna show me when she had more facts. All I know is that she made several trips down to San Bernardino County to check tax records. - Meredith, San Bernardino County is where Amelia died. - I know. (ominous music) (ominous music) (loud beeps) - She was totally out of it. Dancing with this one freaky looking guy, tattoos up on arm down the other. Dancing real close. - Did you get footage? - Did I get footage? I smuggled my mini DV into the club. - Great, we'll do a trouble in paradise story. - [Male] I love those. - And I'll call around, see if we can find out where he was last night. - We can ride this bit for a week. - At least. I'll finish up today's spot and you get that footage downloaded okay? - [Male] Sweet! - El Rancho Estates really represents the peak of my career as a designer and as a builder. Each custom Rancho Estate home has a beautiful dramatic sweeping view over Summit Park. The first of these homes will be available for occupancy as soon as this spring. But we're not talking about cracker boxes here. My workers are craftsmen, artisans, euro-rancho... - Sorry Kev, I got caught up in a staff meeting. (loud gasp) - You're a hard woman to track down Ms. Peterson. - Who are you? What are you doing in here? - Looking for answers. Detective Roy Moloney, San Bernardino Sheriff's department. - Why were you following me? - Why were you running away? - Call me crazy but I have this irrational fear of strange men in parking garages. - I'm investigating the death of your friend, Amelia Moore. - What kind of detective are you? - Homicide. - So Amelia was murdered? - Maybe I can ask the questions? From what I gather you're Amelia Moore's closest friend. - Used to be. Don't know how close we were recently. - What does that mean? - Nothing really, it's just that we didn't talk very much anymore. - Because in watching you at the funeral it seemed that you and Mr. Moore were very close. - Is that a question detective? - I can frame it as a question if you'd like. Are you and Rick Moore sleeping together? - Are you crazy? - Amelia Moore died into what I consider to be extremely suspicious circumstances. So the first place I look for a motive is sex or money. - You get out of here! - I'm not done yet. And you haven't answered the question. - No, Rick Moore is a friend, that's all. What else would you like to know? - Do you have any idea what this means? (ominous music) - This is gibberish. - It's shorthand. It's some weird kind of shorthand we've never seen. - Why would I know what it is? - Because we found it with your friends things. - I can't help you detective. (solemn music) - You're a very bad liar Ms. Peterson. We'll be talking again. (ominous music) - Alright, let's get these organized according to closing dates and see if we can find a pattern. - Hi. - You're gonna make this a habit? - I got something. A lead on the story Amelia was working. It's a name. Carl Timmons. I think he works with the Department of Water. - Where did you get this? - From a detective working Amelia's case. - What is it? - It was written in her notebook in shorthand. Our shorthand, the system we made up so nobody could ever read our notes. - What a great idea. - Laura this is Christie McDermott, you'll be seeing her byline one day soon. Christie this is Laura Peterson. - Nice to meet you. Seeing you on TV you're great. - Thanks. - I spent the day at the San Bernardino Tax Assessors Office. Amelia had to sign for the records that she pulls. - What are they? - Changes in property ownership. They're all around the same area in a place called Cedar Grove. - Amelia died just outside Cedar Grove. - It was a story. It has to be. Amelia's dead because of something she was investigating. - We should take all this to the police. - We could. It's not much but it's something. - Or... - Yes. - We could work the story. Uncover the truth about what Amelia was investigating and how she died. - It's exactly what Amelia would've wanted. - I'll never crack open her attorney. He's already famous and no way he wants his fat face on TV. Of course you schmooze the secretary. So what if he's a guy? Oh come on Todd, take one for the team. What do you mean he's straight? Nobody's straight in Hollywood. Okay, plan B. No, see and wait and get an interview for tomorrow. Yeah, and make sure she knows we want to talk about the breakup, and don't tell him. Thanks. - Inquiring minds wanna know. - It's a living. - Pea brained inquiring minds. - You're teaching, not working as a reporter somewhere so get off your high horse. - I'm teaching because no one wants serious journalism anymore. All they want is slapped ash, sound bite, get it on the air breaking news. - You're not working as a reporter because you kept on getting your employers asses sued. - I did what I had to do to get the truth. - And the truth led you to getting fired and becoming a teacher instead of a reporter. - I think I liked you better when you were an undergrad and hung on my every word. (inquisitive music) - [Laura] There it is. Cedar Groves. - All these sales are within the last eight months. 35 properties. - Looks like a ghost town now. - Did you ever talk to Carl Timmons? - I left him three voicemails. The last one was pretty firm. It doesn't exactly look like a hot bed of scandal does it? - Alright, one of the sales was for 1602 Outlook Avenue. Left. It's as if the owners are still living there. - [Narrator] Yup that's her, the reporter lady. - Do you mind telling us what you talked to her about? - She just wanted to know why we sold the ranch. She didn't know about the water problem. - There's a water problem? - Well we're not really supposed to talk about it until it's public. But the ground waters polluted. We have to buy all our drinking water at the market. Can you imagine buying water? - But somebody bought the property? - Yeah, nice people. They're letting us stay here rent free until we close on our new place. - Rent free, isn't that nice? - Jack Lycar, he's a realtor. He said they're putting up a storage facility. A great big one. I guess when the waters bad the lands not much good for anything else. (solemn music) It's awful. (ominous music) (slow paced music) - Yeah you got it about right. Far stinking the groundwater. So when they offered to buy this place we jumped at the chance. - Very wise of you Max. Who was the buyer? - A company out of Sacramento. They're gonna use it for them solar powered windmill things. - What was the name of the company? - Sol-Green Technologies. Yeah that was the name. - Did you actually see that water report? - Well I, we weren't supposed to keep it you know? Everything was hush hush. But I sorta stole a copy. Bernice here has been sick. I didn't know whether it was related or not. I wanted some kind of proof in case I needed it for the insurance. - [Laura] Of course. - Do you still have a copy? - The other reporter, your friend, she's the one who died in that car fire? - Yes, her name was Amelia Moore and we think that something she discovered out here may have led to her death. - I thought it was an accident? - That's what we're trying to find out. - I told her I didn't have it. I thought it would just be trouble. - I understand Max, but it could be very important. - You think she'd be alive if, if I'd given it to her? - I don't know. All I know is that it could make a difference now. - I should of known something was screwy. Nobody ever even came to look at the place. Jack Lycar handled everything. Acted like he was doing everybody a big favor! - The toxicity studies. The supervisor of the project was Carl Timmons. (inquisitive music) Is this it? - [Meredith] Yeah, 32220 yeah. (loud knocking) - I don't believe Loretta's at home. - What's that? - Mrs. Oxley. Haven't seen her all morning. Sometimes she walks up to the store, sometimes she goes off for a visit. - Mrs. Oxley's only been here a couple of months since selling her farm isn't that right? - Yeah, she's one of the short-timers. Husband got burned up in a fire. Say, don't I know you? You're the TV lady, The Inside Buzz girl. - [Laura] Guilty. - If that kind of show had been around when I was young I probably would have been on there. I was quite the little starlet. - Oh, yeah. - Producers, directors, writers! I had my pick. - I can see why. I'm wondering if you have... - Of course times were different then. A girl with a reputation had a harder time. - I'm sorry. I'm wondering if you have any idea if Mrs. Oxley will be gone long. - Oh I wish I could help you honey. Say, maybe you could do a show where are they now? - Maybe, maybe. - [Lady In Hat] Look here. You won't believe the people I knew. - [Laura] Oh wow. - [Lady In Hat] And my favorite director, Alfred Hitchcock. - [Laura] Wow. - [Lady In Hat] Yeah. And Janet Lee and Tony Curtis. - Oh you worked with the greats huh? - Oh yeah. And the heavenly Cary Grant. - Bye bye. - [Lady In Hat] And Tyrone Howard. Don't forget, Tyrone Howard. - [Laura] Cedar Grove. Looks like it was once a thriving country town. - [Meredith] Once, not anymore. I guess the bad water story isn't such a big secret after all. (ominous music) - The report's dated January 5th of this year. Yeah that's the one. And it shows nothing wrong with the groundwater? Thanks so much for looking. I guess I'll let my kids know they can drink the water again. The report on file with the Department of Water is perfectly clean. Water's pure as rain. - Surprise surprise. - [Laura] I gotta run down Carl Timmons. - Pretty amazing, the way you get people to open up. - I forgot how exciting this part of it all is. Putting the pieces together. - Admit it Laura, you miss it. And this is what you were trained to do. It's in your blood. - You wanna take point this time? - Of course, it's in my blood too. Hello? - [Narrator] Yeah, I'll be right there, hang on. - It looks like the Cedar Grove real estate bubble has already burst. - Hi. Inside Buzz Girl. Jack Lycar. - [Laura] Laura Peterson. - Come on in. So you looking to buy out this way are ya? - Mr. Lycar, I'd like to get right to the point. - Okay. - I'm Meredith Backaman of the Daily Free Press. I've got a few questions for you. - Sure, fire away. - You've closed on quite a few deals over the last few months. - Well I am the only realtor in these parts. We're a dying breed. - We've interviewed residents on the south side of Cedar Grove. Transactions where you've represented both the buyer and the seller. - Dual agency is legal in the state of California. - On 35 transactions? You don't think that's pushing the ethical boundaries a little? - I believe everybody was satisfied. - Didn't you tell people there were problems with the groundwater? - Look, when stories come up about bad water, even if they're just rumors, I have a duty to be upfront with all parties. Disclosure laws are very clear about that. - But you were being more than upfront weren't you? You showed them a toxicity report from the Department of Water, or should I say on the forged letterhead from the Department of Water? - Wait a minute, what are you saying? Are you saying the water was poisoned? - I think you know it's not Mr. Lycar. - Look, I'll admit I had some pretty good commissions last year, but I saw that report. I mean hell, I even sold my own house outside of town. I thought I was doing everyone a favor. - The buyers you represented didn't have any qualms about purchasing property with water problems? - A big corporation doesn't really care about water. - What big corporation would that be Mr. Lycar? - Alright, I admit I made some money, but I was very upfront with everybody. If they didn't wanna buy and sell then they didn't have to sell. I mean I don't know what the hell you people want from me. I thought I was doing everyone a favor. Now, if you'll excuse me I've got some work to do. - The part I don't understand is why was Amelia even interested in this story? - People cheated out of their homes, maybe you don't find that kind of story compelling in Hollywood... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but they were all paid. I mean yes it was deceptive but a real estate scam story, they're a dime a dozen. - It was my fault. She wanted to drop the story but I told her something smelled fishy. I told her to dig deeper. I got her killed. - No, you can't blame yourself Meredith. - Oh yes I can. My head hurts. Don't you have some boyfriend to go home to or something? - I'm between men at the moment. - Stay that way. I married two and they were both louses. - Well you probably ran them off. Told them what they were doing wasn't good enough. (laughter) - I did actually. - [Laura] I know. - Can you imagine if I'd had children? They wouldn't have stood a chance. What about you? I expected you to be married by now. - Oh I don't know. I think honestly it had a lot to do with Amelia. - You were pretty frustrated when she quit school and married Rick. - No I was angry. But now I understand what a difficult choice it was for Amelia. And she made the right decision. Gloria's an amazing girl. - You lost your partner. - I lost my direction too I guess. I wanted so badly to be successful. - And you are. - We literally came from nothing Amelia and me. - Amelia and I. - We met our freshman year and we swore we'd go to the top together. The day I was her bridesmaid at her wedding was bittersweet. (phone ringing) - Stop the presses! Pop star elopes with bodyguard. Public shocked! - Shh. - [Meredith] Film at 11. - Laura Peterson. Well yeah, I'll be right over. (ominous music) - Do you know who Peter Bergstrom is? - He's a movie producer right? - Yeah maybe he's producing but mostly he's a real estate developer. One of the biggest in the state. - Okay. - So why did Amelia have a box full of information on him? Laura what's going on? - I don't know what all this means but, Amelia was working a story Rick. - For what? - To sell I presume. Write it up and sell it freelance. - We had plenty of money. - It wasn't about the money. It was doing something that made her feel good about herself. - You saying she wasn't happy? - I'm still trying to figure it out myself. Where did you find all this? - In behind the Christmas decorations. - Well she certainly did a lot of research. Why was Amelia interested in Peter Bergstrom? - Beautiful isn't it? - Actually it is. And I'm not normally a fan of big developments. - Well El Rancho Estates will be different. I have to say you look even prettier in person than you do on television Ms. Peterson. - Laura please. It was good of you to see me short notice Mr. Bergstrom. - Peter please. And I have to say you peaked my curiosity. What have I done to deserve the attention of The Inside Buzz? - You're producing a movie I hear. - Well that's L.A., who isn't? - Yeah. - Please, would you like to sit down, have a seat? If I'm gonna get grilled, might as well do this in comfort huh? Can I get you a cup of coffee, some water or anything? - [Laura] No I'm fine thank you. (phone ringing) - Excuse me for one second. Yeah Margo. Ah yeah, put him through, I'll take that one call. Sorry, one second. - Hey professor! I turned up some interesting information in a database. There was an explosion out in Cedar Grove about a year ago. - Another car fire? - A propane accident. A man got burned really badly. He finally died a couple months ago. But it was the name that jumped out at me. - J.R. Oxley. - Yeah, how'd you know? - We've been looking for Loretta. His wife. - Loretta? - Yeah, okay. Ron, David, I'll do business with you guys any time. And hey Ron, I want to fly in that plane. Okay thanks. Bye bye. Thank you. - You climbed Mount Everest? That's impressive. - Actually it's my greatest folly. I broke my ankle on the summit. A 145 pound Sherpa named Laseng Porgay had to carry me down to base camp on his back. Not my finest hour. - I hope you gave him a big tip. - Actually I gave Laseng his own travel agency. Now he has to deal with more crazy Americans than ever. - Is that how you describe yourself? A crazy American? - Yeah I guess so. When I was a kid, a doctor told me that I had an adrenaline problem. Too much. But that's probably not what you came here to discuss. - No, no, that's great. It gives me a feel for you and then we can talk about the movie later. - Okay, too much energy. In high school I played every sport imaginable. That seemed to help. In college I discovered other things and I sort of threw myself into partying 100% and all that bad behavior that that entails. But eventually sewing your wild oats catches up to you and I put that behavior behind me. But you're not really here to discuss my movie are you? (ominous music) - Do you know a woman named Amelia Moore? - No I can't say that I do. Who is she? - A friend of mine, she died. - [Peter] Sorry to hear that. - She was murdered in Cedar Grove. - Cedar Grove, where's that? - I think you know exactly where that is Mr. Bergstrom. - Ms. Peterson I'm afraid that you've come here under false pretenses. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my office now. - But if you could only just tell... - No, out now, thank you. - And we were getting along so well. - Mrs. Oxley, Loretta Oxley. Please I need a moment. I'm a friend of Amelia Moore's. I want to talk to you about the sale of your farm. - [Oxley] I can't talk to you. - We've spoken to a lot of your neighbors. - No, you shouldn't be here, you understand? - Please I'd like to talk about your husband. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) Go on, go. (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (ominous music) - So let's report this to the police. - Oh come on Laura, we dig deeper. The police aren't gonna find this guy. - Detective Maloney might. - Oh that would be the easy way out, let somebody else uncover the truth. - We both know what it was. - No not for certain. - The guy could have killed you! - Guerillas shot at me in Nicaragua Laura, mobsters threatened to break my legs in Chicago. You expect me to be afraid of some hick in a pick up truck in Cedar Grove? Maybe you should go back to reading press releases and calling it news. - You were scared weren't you? - Where were you today, the Polo Lounge? - I tried to chase down Carl Timmons. Apparently he's on sick leave from the Department of Water but he's never at home. - Interesting. - And then I met a man. Amelia was doing research on him. Peter Bergstrom. - Peter Bergstrom? Why? - You know him? - Well of course. Bergstrom's helped build southern California. The piece that got me fired off the Times was an expose of corruption on the Bergstrom empire. - Amelia had a box full of information on him. - I hate that family. Peter's an irresponsible playboy but his father was cold, hard, vicious. He'd stop at nothing to get what he wanted. - So what's the connection to Cedar Grove? - Isn't Bergstrom's new development in Summit Park? (loud ringing) - Laura Peterson. Yes, yes I did. (ominous music) I see. No, no, don't send a squad car, I'll come to you. I know where it is. I'm leaving right now. I just found Carl Timmons. (slow paced music) - Carl Timmons. Kind of fitting for a man in the water business. - He drowned? Tell me it was an accident. - Not judging by the fingermarks on his throat. It looks like Carl was hiding out here. His grandparents old house. Neighbor kid found him. How did you know Carl Timmons? - I didn't. - There are four messages from you on his voicemail. - Well if you listened to them then you know I never met him. - Why don't you quit the games? 'Cause whatever's going on here these people are playing for keeps. This isn't some cute Hollywood divorce story. These people are killers. - I'd be open to an exchange of information. - I'd be open to throwing your ass in jail for obstructing a homicide investigation. How's that sound? - Sounds like you wouldn't get the information you need. (slow paced music) Carl Timmons created this report showing high levels of arsenic in the drinking water at Cedar Grove. - And Cedar Grove was part of this territory right? - It was. The real report from the Department of Water shows that the drinking water is perfectly fine. - So he faked a report. - Which got floated out among the residents at Cedar Grove and they all panicked and everybody sold cheap. - Who'd they sell to? - Three different companies. Storage facility group, a solar power company, and an investment group out of Nevada. - This is what Timmons was killed over? - And Amelia Moore too. This is the trading part. - Well, We found some interesting things in the victims hard drive. - Amelia's. - What? - Her name was Amelia. - I'm sorry, really. There's a whole set of pictures of houses taken in and around Cedar Grove. - I don't recognize some of them. - You can keep those, I've got copies. Also there's a couple things in this notepad we just can't seem to figure out. - Let me see it. This one's a date. October 22nd 1989. You weren't very nice to me the first time we met. This one, this is strange. RCDSGS8, I have no idea what that means. And this one, this says Summit Park kill fee, three million dollars. - Summit Park. That's nowhere near here. Thank you. I know. Oh, careful. And he says, "What do you mean I'm Irish?" (laughter) Listen, I know you're a reporter and all, but please, be careful. - I will I promise. - And if you think of anything else, call me, don't be a hero. These are bad people. (loud beeping) Laura. Sorry if I was rough on you earlier. - I'm a big girl, I can handle it. - Keep this to yourself. Your friend Amelia, it was murder. (solemn music) - Thank you Roy. (slow paced music) (loud flashing) Today we confirmed what everybody's been guessing all along. The storybook romance that had all of America talking is officially Tinseltown history. That's right kids. The lawyers have cited irreconcilable differences. The publicist's are spinning their stories and Hollywood's royal couple is officially going their separate ways. And that's The Inside Buzz for today. (loud flashing) Today we confirmed what everybody. Yeah, October 22nd 1989. That's what she'd written down. Listen Mirna, I gotta go. I'm still finishing tomorrow's piece. Yeah. Alright, let me know what you find. Bye. And Hollywood's royal couple is officially going their separate ways. - Hey, where you been all day? - Oh, working something. - What, what do you got, a hot story? - Pretty hot yeah. - Hey. You've been acting kinda weird since your friend died. You okay? - Todd, do you like what we do? Do you think it's important? - Well I definitely like it. Important? I don't know. But listen, people love our stuff. - I have a friend, an old journalism professor. She says, "Serious journalism produces "serious consequences." Am I a joke? - Alright listen, it's a big world out there. Lots of bad stuff happening. Now I'm not saying we need to know about it all, but all that bad stuff needs a balance. And that's us. We're part of the balance. - But do you feel good about what we do? - Yeah I do. The question is do you? Hey, stole your cookies. Want one? - Sure. Wait, my cookies? - Yeah, I found them on your desk. - [Laura] Who are they from? - I don't know, no note. - Put them down Todd. Carefully. - What, you don't wanna share with me? - Put it down! (slow paced music) - It's an explosive device. Not very sophisticated but powerful enough. - How did it get in here? - Delivery guy dropped it off. We'll see if we can pull anything off the security cameras. - Roy who's doing this? - Whoever they are they mean business. Back off a little while Laura. Give me time to do my job. - They killed Amelia, they went after Meredith, and now they've tried to kill me. You know what that tells me? - I'm afraid to ask. - It tells me we're getting closer to the truth. - Yeah well there's also something called the Freedom of Information Act. Those records are public documents and I'm officially requesting them. Thank you so much for your help. Idiot. Okay, this RCDSGS8 GSA is a government pay scale. RCDS indicates a reserve county deputy sheriff. - But what does that got to do with any of this? - Not a clue. But I've requested county personnel records from the Cedar Grove area in the late 1980's. Right around the date Amelia would have written down. - Well, Bergstrom has something definitely to do with this. Summit Park kill fee three million dollars. That's a hefty penalty. - Kill fee? - When they made the deal they get approval for El Rancho Estates he agreed to pay Summit Park three million dollars. But it didn't go through. - Yeah but the deals going through right? I mean you saw the model. - Yeah yeah he's been on the news all week. The grand slam opening's next week. - This is weird. - I don't know. And I still can't find any mention of that date anywhere either. Although I swear I've seen... - Hey, guess what I, sorry. - Oh no, no, no, it's okay. Did you find something? - Yeah, there's a last minute emergency Zoning Commission meeting tonight in Cedar Grove. I found it up on their website. - It might be interesting. - But everybody up there's gonna know who we are by now. - They don't know me. - You're willing to sit through a Zoning Commission meeting? - Oh my god yes. Can I? - No it's too dangerous. - Of course you can. You're a journalist aren't you Christie? - Absolutely professor. - We shouldn't involve her, she's just a kid. - You and Amelia were both kids when you did your best work. - And therefore my clients Sol-Green technologies request a variance to rezone their land from agricultural to commercial. - Those in favor? Opposed? The chair breaks the tie in favor. - [Lycar] Thank you. - Mr. Lycar, the Cedar Groves Zoning Commission grants your clients discretionary approval A1 to C3. We are adjourned. (loud tap) - Thank you. Thank you very much Floyd. I really appreciate the expedited service. But, you gotta tell me who the girl in the back is. It's not often you get spectators at rezoning meetings. - It's nothing Jack. Some kind of civics class assignment. Gosh, the girls didn't look like that when I went to school. - Don't quit your class assignment huh? Come on, I'll buy you coffee. (slow paced music) (laughter) - Mrs. Sweeney, do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? - Oh I just really wanna get home. - Pretty tough tonight huh? Does Floyd Niven always run his meetings like that? - Lately anyway. - Ah, they're ganging up on you huh? - Well it doesn't help that Jack Lycar has two relatives on the board. - Really? Which ones? - That's his brother-in-law on the left and the other one's his uncle. - Making Floyd Niven the swing vote on these rezonings? - That's the way it's been for the last three meetings. Or at least whenever Lycar shows up. - Tell me this company, Sol-Green Technologies, do they ever give up the names of their principles? - Oh yeah, their Board of Directors is listed right here in the petition to rezone. Listen, good luck with your class. - Why does Sol-Green need all these different plots? - This isn't about some civics class is it? Okay. These are Lycar's recent rezonings. - [Lycar] Someone calls out a number... - Sorry man I gotta go. - All I know is that last year Floyd Niven sure couldn't afford a Rolex. (slow paced music) - All these threads. Peter Bergstrom, Carl Timmons, Cedar Grove, Amelia's notes, nothing fits together. - There's hundreds of names in these Sheriff's employees records. - Two questions we haven't answered yet. What does the October 22nd date mean and why was Amelia interested in this story? - What was she doing at a derelict cemetery? - Three questions. - I got the names for the Board of Director's for Sol-Green Technologies. - Oh goody more names. - I also nabbed these maps from the Zoning Commission. - Nice work. Don't they usually put those windmills in long roads? - How valuable can the land be if... Wait a second, wait a second. Come here. Look at this. Look at this. It's all one contiguous property, look at that. Look at that. (ominous music) - This is where it happened. - I did this. - [Laura] Whoever rigged that gas tank that's who did this not you. There's the cemetery. - I hate ghosts. (ominous music) Hey look at this. It says keep out, I'm going in. - Stottlemeyer. Jeremiah Stottlemeyer. - There's a water pumping plant here. Maybe she was looking for Carl Timmons here. What are you doing? - Meredith. I'd like to introduce the Vice President of Sol-Green Technologies. Jeremiah Stottlemeyer. - You're kidding. - And here's treasurer Mary Anne Jacobson, Richard Goodman, Peter Tippet. He's the president. They're all here. The entire Board of Directors. - If one of those companies is made up of ghost directors, maybe all of them are. - And that makes Jack Lycar the only real person involved. - So then he isn't just representing teams of buyers, he is the buyer. - But how'd he get the money? He'd have to get bank loans, and down payments... - Wait, wait, wait! What if they've done something to this? - How could they? I was right here the whole time. - I know but I... - Meredith they want us to be scared. You know what I say? Let's go get 'em. - [Meredith] Alright. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) - If Lycar's running three different companies, he's gotta be hiding something. - It's an old trick for assembling a large tract of land. Otherwise if people know that you need their land to complete your property they'll hold out for a high price. - So Lycar must have paid off Timmons for the fake water report. - He killed Timmons? Lycar hardly seems the type. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, turn that up. There's something El Rancho Estates. - What? - [Narrator] Peter Bergstrom announced unexpectedly today that he's pulling the multimillion dollar housing project out of Summit Park. City officials in Summit Park are threatening legal action. But Bergstrom insists El Rancho Estates will be built instead on a large tract of land in Cedar Grove in San Bernardino County. Now trading in local stocks was... - On Lycar's land. - It makes no sense. Bergstrom's got millions invested in Summit Park. Survey expenses, environmental impact studies... - Plus the three million dollar kill fee. - Why would Bergstrom allow his original deal to fall apart? - [Laura] Drop it on Jack Lycar's lap? How much money would be on the table for a deal this size? - [Meredith] Hundreds of millions. (engine revving) - People are falling all over themselves to do business with Peter Bergstrom. Why would he end up with Jack Lycar? What's wrong? - Maybe nothing. Do me a favor will you? Pull over, let this guy pass. - Is that the guy who tried to run you off the road? - I think so. - Can you get his plate number? - No plates on the front. (engine revving) Laura the bus! - [Laura] We can make it. - Laura! (loud horn) (tires screeching) - Woo hoo! - Lycar. It's me Reese. No I didn't. They got away. - I mean it Laura, we stop this now. - How can you say that? - Let the detectives handle it. - Meredith this is crazy, this isn't you. What about everything you taught me? - Excuse me for being human. It's been a long time since I've been really killed. Twice in one week. - You can't just quit, this is what we do. - Look at yourself, look at me. A celebrity hack newscaster and a washed up reporter teaching at a second rate school. Who are we kidding? We can delude ourselves most of the time but out there it's about to get us killed. - You're not washed up. - I've been in a downward spiral for a decade. You wanted to know why I'm so nasty, that's your answer. I was unhireable doing the one thing I loved to do so I had settled for this. Laura you're not 20 years old. Why would you ever listen to what I said? You're a successful independent woman with a great career. Go back to your life. Enjoy it while you've got it. Amelia's dead. Nothing we do is ever gonna bring her back. (solemn music) - So cozy. You're gonna get to school. - You can watch this, it's so funny. Geronimo! - Oh, now they're all ready. And so now you make sure they get to school on time. And I'm just gonna check with daddy and see if dinner's ready okay? Be right back sweetie. Bye you guys. How's it coming? - Not a total loss. - Slow is good. - How's Gloria? - Sad. Doing better though I think. - You know, thanks for coming around. It's good for her. - I'll be here whenever she needs me. What's that? - Oh. Amelia stashed this stuff all over the house. That was tucked in behind the furnace I think. (ominous music) - Rick. - [Rick] Okay, I think we're ready! - Deborah Varner. Deputy J.R. Oxley? - What? - This is it. This woman, Deborah Varner, she was driving Peter Bergstrom's sports car in Cedar Grove. The Sheriff, his name was J.R. Oxley. - So? - But how does it connect? Bergstrom wasn't even there. It's got to connect somehow doesn't it? - [Rick] Am I supposed to know what you're talking about? - I'm sorry Rick, rain check on the spaghetti. Oh hey, is Meredith here? - I haven't seen her. Guess who was reserve county deputy sheriff from 1985 to 92? Jack Lycar. - So was J.R. Oxley. Both of them Sheriff's the same time Peter Bergstrom's girlfriend was killed in an accident. 10 years later Oxley dies and his widow is pressured to sell her land to Jack Lycar. - He had already bought out most of the land in Cedar Grove. - Which just happens to be where Peter Bergstrom suddenly decides to build a huge housing development. - What does this all have to do with Amelia's murder? Let me come. - Absolutely not. - Oh come on, I'm in on this, you can't just shut me out. I wanna be you one day. - Believe me, you don't wanna be me. - I don't wanna be you. I wanna be as good as you. Show me how. (slow paced music) - You better follow orders a hell of a lot better than I did at your age. - Yes ma'am. (upbeat music) Looks like Lycar's still at work. - So he is. This could be interesting. - What are you gonna do? - [Laura] Watch Lycar's face when we show him our hand. (ominous music) - Hello. - Sorry we're closed... Oh it's you again. - Yup, me again. - You're still working on that civics class assignment little lady? This is not a good time for me. I'm shutting down the business. - That must have been a big check you got from Bergstrom and Associates. El Rancho Estates is a huge project. - Yeah, it'll certainly be good for Cedar Grove. - Interesting article here. I wonder if you saw it. It's from October 22nd 1989. It tells about the death of Peter Bergstrom's girlfriend. - It's funny. You were Deputy County Sheriff back then. - Yeah well, I wish I could be of more help. If you'll excuse me. - I thought you might remember it. Especially since you were the deputy who filed the accident report. - Is that true? Were you bluffing? - Sometimes it's not what you know it's what they think you know. - So you lie to get the truth? - Something like that. (ominous music) I still can't reach Meredith. - Maybe she's following some lead. She's here. - Mrs. Oxley. Mrs. Oxley we need to talk to you. - Please just go away. - We need to talk to you about your husband. - We know that he was badly burned in a propane explosion. - It was a terrible accident. There's nothing to talk about. - I don't believe it was an accident at all. I think you told Amelia Moore the truth about how J.R. was murdered. About what really went on that night of the car wreck didn't you? - Look what happened to her! Okay. (slow paced music) J.R. was such a handsome man. If you could've seen what that fire done to him. - Mrs. Oxley, when did you learn the truth? - A couple of months ago J.R.'s hospital bills were taking everything we had. And then he told me about this money he put away. $20,000. He told me to pay the doctors with it. - Did he tell you where he got it? - Jack Lycar gave it to him. To keep quiet about that night. - It's okay, just tell us whatever you told Amelia. - J.R. was first on the scene so he called it in. The girl was dead. But she wasn't the one driving, it was a young man. Drunk out of his mind. Before J.R. could call it in, Jack Lycar shows up and pulls rank. He always was a weasel that one. Lycar talks to the young man for a while and then he tells J.R. he'll handle everything. Lycar took the dead girls body and put it in the drivers seat. And then told J.R. to look the other way if he wanted to keep his job. - Well how did that news photo get taken? - Some local guy from the paper just got one shot before Lycar chased him off and then he kicked J.R. out of there too. - And what happened after that? - Well the next day the newspaper comes out saying the girl was driving all alone. Well that ain't right. And J.R.'s pretty upset as you can imagine. And a couple of days later Lycar gives J.R. $20,000 to keep quiet. But they were just helping some young rich kid out of a jam. That's how Lycar put it. Well times were tough. J.R. was only a part-time deputy so he didn't get much of a pension. But he didn't touch a penny. He called it blood money. Until he didn't have a choice. - When Lycar came around buying up property, did he offer you a fair price? - Oh it didn't matter. My J.R. stood out to him. No way we'd sell. He said he was tired of Lycar and all his lies! Well that lasted two weeks later J.R.'s in a burn ward after someone broke the valve off that damn propane tank. J.R. was a good man. - Mrs. Oxley, this is very important. Who was driving the sports car that night? Did your husband tell you? It was Peter Bergstrom wasn't it? - You know, I bet Lycar's been blackmailing Bergstrom for all these years. - Until he was ready for the big payday. Forcing Bergstrom to move the new development to Cedar Grove. - That's Professor Backaman isn't it? - [Laura] Yeah. - [Christie] Who is she with? - [Laura] Peter Bergstrom. - I don't get it. - That makes two of us. - Maybe he has something to do with the university. You know grants, foundations, that kind of thing. - Somehow I don't think so. - You have no idea what you're getting yourself involved with Meredith. - Peter you can't pull off the tough guy act. You're not your father. When I wrote that expose on his business he came after me with everything he had. Brought me down. My career, my marriage, your family owes me. - You're the one that sent that woman after me. The one who got killed. - I sent her to finish what I started. Your family thinks you can buy your way out of any problem, well fine. Time to buy me. (ominous music) (engine revs) (tires screeching) - There has to be some kind of reasonable explanation for this right? - Meredith wrote an expose on the Bergstrom's. She would of known the date Deborah Varner died. - Why would she lie to us? - Because she wanted to know where the money was, what the scam was. She needed us to help figure that out. And Amelia. - But, all she's taught us. - The one thing she taught us more than any other, you don't stop. You do whatever you need to until you uncover the truth. You stay here. (loud screaming) - [Laura] Christie! Let her go! - Help! Help! Please! Help! - Christie! - [Laura] Help! And after we saw Bergstrom and Meredith talking that's when they kidnapped Christie. - You gotta go to the police. - And risk Lycar killing her? You're crazy. Oh god, the poor kid. And I was the one who got her into this. God, and I knew better! It's up to me. - What? - I might have one bargaining chip. - What's that? - The truth. (suspenseful music) - Afraid you missed her dear. - You're kidding?! - She's hard to catch ain't she? - Do you have any idea when she might be back? - Oh she's gone. For good. Yeah. Went to live with her sister. - Well do you have the address? - Somewhere in Santa Fe. I dropped Loretta at the bus station myself. - How long ago? - Last night, about midnight. I'm sorry, did I do something wrong? - No. - Awe. You look so lost sweetie. (fast paced music) - Miss. How'd you like to be on TV? - What the hell is this? - We know how Deborah Varner died. I know about you and I know about Jack Lycar. - [Peter] What are you talking about? - I got the story. I just thought you'd might like to comment before it airs. - This is ridiculous. The gossip columnist is suddenly becoming a hard biting news reporter. Is that what's going on? - That's right. I wouldn't mind moving a rung up the journalistic ladder, and busting your ass is the perfect place to start. - And that's all cute and everything. Turn off your camera and get out of my office before I call my attorney! - You and Jack Lycar conspired to make it look like Deborah Varner died alone. When in fact you were the driver that night. - What do you do? You bust into somebody's office, stick a camera in their face, and start hurling accusations at 'em? Get out... - You killed Deborah Varner and you paid off Jack Lycar to cover it up! Now Lycar's come back to blackmail you. That's the only reason you'd ever build El Rancho Estates on his land. - Alright, what you're saying right now is completely outrageous! - What's outrageous is that three people have died. J.R. Oxley, Carl Timmons, and my friend Amelia Moore. - I'm truly sorry. But I have nothing to do with any of this. - I interviewed Loretta Oxley. The deputy's widow. J.R. Oxley told his wife the truth before he died. - Well look, I don't know what you think you have there in your little hand, but in a court of law, that would be called hearsay. - Oh I'm not taking it to court, I'm a hack remember? I make my living reporting innuendo and speculation, it's the new journalism. Oh and let me promise you this is gonna make great television. - Why don't you tell me what it is that you really want. - A college student named Christie McDermott. She's been kidnapped and I want her released unharmed immediately. - Okay fantastic, so do I. But I have no idea what you're talking about! - I didn't think you did. It's Lycar. Your partner. - You wanna talk? You really wanna talk? Take your camera, turn it off. Turn it off, put it down. Fine. Show me your tape. Play it please, 'cause I'd love to see what's on it. Just pop it in over here. - My husband J.R. Oxley was the first deputy on the scene the night of the accident. Peter Bergstrom was driving drunk when he crashed his car in Cedar Grove. He killed that poor girl in the passenger seat. She died 'cause of him. Jack Lycar and Bergstrom covered up what happened. They made it look like that young girl done it to herself. (solemn music) - You have to understand, I loved Deborah Varner. And that night has haunted me my entire life. (slow paced music) - Tell me Peter, why'd you pick this godforsaken spot?! - This is where the accident happened. This is where it all started and this is where it's all gonna end. - Sounds morbid. Look, I don't know why I need to meet with Lycar. You're paying me not him. - There's too many side deals. I want everything on the table. Here he comes. - Wait a minute, what's he doing with Christie? - This is crazy Peter. This is just crazy! - [Meredith] You idiot, why'd you grab the girl? - Insurance! What the hell is she doing here? - Calm down Jack, we're just finishing a business deal here. You said it yourself, there's plenty for everybody right? - Yeah but why did you get her involved? - She got herself involved, believe me. - I'm cashing in same as you. - Peter I had this all covered. - I want my payoff after 15 wasted years. - Please, my heart bleeds. Frisk her. - Back off. - You know what, this ends now. People are getting killed Jack. Kidnapped! This is not the deal that we made! - She's clean. - Deals change Petey boy. - [Peter] No, no, you let that girl go now. Or this whole deal is off. - [Lycar] You know, your father had a more practical way of dealing with these things. I let the girl go when the deal is done. - Okay, Lycar just gave us plenty on the kidnapping. I'm calling it in. - No wait. I want him for murder. - Let's get rid of her. - No, what are you gonna do with her? - What do you care? All of a sudden you got scruples? - Jack, you can't go whacking every reporter who starts asking questions. - Now you listen to me Peter. I wanna live your life. I wanna chance at the good life, and if someone has to disappear well that's just tough! - You killed Amelia didn't you? - No, I did. - You shut your mouth Reese! He paid me 20 grand and another 15 for the water guy. - We've got 'em, okay move move! (loud sirens) - What is this? - [Narrator] Hold off the perimeter. Lock it down, keep it together. - Reese let's go! Come on! Reese! - I'm done fixing your problems Lycar. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Jack! Forget it man, I'm wired. This is all on tape, you're finished. - Are you out of your mind? You'll lose everything. Everything! - Everything but my self respect. - [Laura] Christie, are you okay?! - I thought... - [Laura] It's alright honey. No one can hurt you. You're safe now. (solemn music) - Jack Lycar. You're under arrest for the murders of Amelia Moore and Carl Timmons. Get him out of here. - All those years you lectured us, did you really mean anything? - I was teaching you to become better journalists. - You're the reason Amelia died. - Yes I directed her towards the Bergstrom's. They've always been ripe for bringing down. I never meant for her to get hurt. - No, You just wanted her to dig up some dirt for you. - She was a journalist! - She was a wife and a mother. She idolized you. - She chose the wrong idol. (solemn music) - Hey there Amelia. I wish you would of told me what you were doing. Maybe we could've done it together. I'm working for The Times now. A second string metro. But it's a start. Right? Maybe once in a while you can look down and give me a hand? Like old times.
