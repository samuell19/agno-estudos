The closer the day of his release from prison came, the more Kulterer was afraid of returning to his wife. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. I know. Normally he never talked, if he wasn't asked. The warden was well-disposed towards Kulterer. In contrast to the other, mostly unruly inmates he was a quiet man who didn't make any demands, followed all rules and orders and who was really content with everything but himself. A parcel and a letter? A letter as well. Yes, yes, I know Mister. All right. Who is on latrine duty? He lived a life sealed away in himself, unnoticed by his fellow inmates. He passed the free time - they had much free time in the prison, as they regularly worked only five or six hours a day on the printing machines - by writing down ideas or as he thought, insignificant thoughts that bothered him almost constantly. Out of boredom or out of despair he read to himself his own short stories and tales. "The Cat", for example. Or "The Dry-dock", "The Hyena" or "The Landowner's Administrator" or "Deathbed" Most of the time, these stories occured to him at night. Arter and Hofer are absent. They reported sick. Instead, Gruber Gerhard and Altendorfer Herbert take their place. And don't forget to inspect cell 62. That's all, thank you. As they thought impulsively, in their deranged unconsciousness, about the destruction of the elements, in their bound to occur defeat ...he felt it, from a distance. In the last days before his release - that weighed painfully on his heart and mind, but without crushing him, making it's humane expression on his face - he seeked contact with his fellow inmates, often touchingly wishing to consolidate it once and for all. The invention of human thought striked him to be the most precious gift. Tell something! This one, this one, this one... Not this one, he goes home... Come. Strange, how he can see it. What? The thing with the beer mug. I don't get it, but it's OK. The idiot, what did he do? He dropped dead from the tree. Dead... dead... He only wrote sad stories. Sometimes funny ones occured to him Ones that he himself had to laugh at. But he couldn't write them down. Thanks! Everything OK? No occurrences, Sir. Wiesmayer... Neumann... Kulterer... on saturday Kulterer leaves as well. Kulterer! Letter and Parcel! Parcel and letter. What do you say? How clear they where here - in the darkness, in the middle of suppressed manhood, not daring to breath because of reprimands - the shapes of all notions. How clear was even the most remote... most reluctant... most arbitrary... most impalpable. Mate! Kulterer! Read carefully. Read carefully! You'll get released now. You have to read the paper thoroughly, do you understand? Read thoroughly... All words had the same meaning to him. But many conveyed him, right from the beginning, deep into a mysterious darkness... into the paradise of a ground color... and into figures and numbers... the precondition for writings. Fill in, you know... fill in! He was afraid that in freedom, out of his convict uniform, he would be unable to write. He was afraid, that, in the fierce exposure of being discharged, he would be nothing. Arrange in pairs! Here! Stop! 4.. 6.. 8. Move it! Forward march! He's got a lucky break, he can go home. New ones are coming. No? New ones are coming, right? What's that? New ones are coming! New ones are always the old ones. Oh well... There are five... three of them have been here before. They are old ones. The other two are not fully new, right? Yes, I think we always get new ones. Oh well... We are bald... ...bald is what we are. I look like Yul Brynner. Nevertheless, the discipline and the immorality of the discipline in prison benefited his thoughts, and indeed everything. You'll get released, right? We have to clean up the room. Yeah, wait a bit longer... New ones are coming, right? There's no difference between a monastery and a jail, he thought. Maybe the only difference is, that the monastery is prison by choice and jail is by force. One is placed upon oneself and can be left whenever you like. In the other you get locked up by force and you can not leave whenever you like. He said farewell to the buildings. How beautiful and perfectly obedient he perceived, all of a sudden, much stronger than all those years, the lines of the walls. He always loved to go to the fields and meadows. He always perceived the warmer seasons as more poignant than fall and winter. It's too cruel under the lash of the warden in the sun. The laughter of the farmer's wives is a terrible abyss. He only worked for a short time in the logger group. He was too weak. The young ones always tried to get into the logger's group... They thought about escape. Hey, Kulterer! Move it! Faster! Come on! Move it! He strikes lightning-fast. They call him "The Rubber Sausage". because he often uses his club to make his voice heard. Rightfulness. Short words in a low voice, that's him. All those parcels from his wife contained the same meat, paper, butter, socks, a letter... He was always afraid of unpacking, as he was of reading the letter. Surprisingly, during the night he wrote a story with the title "Logic". A Meditation. He asked himself, what kind of word is the word "Logic"? The word "Logic"... Read us something. "Logic. Logic would be, not to accept it. To take the pen out of one's hand." He couldn't allow himself being tempted into believing that they where moved. But he was very happy. There is no injustice at all. In his case, no injustice towards him was found. He did something that was not allowed and he was punished for it. "Where is the limit of freedom, and from where is it set?", he asked himself He never thought about escape. Here we are again. In the beginning he trembled, when the door was locked behind him. Even though there was no rebellion in him, he felt beat down every single time. Naturally, back then, in these moments the word "Backtalk" was engrained on his face. But he never uttered it. Anything wrong? In the prison, there was a lot of primitive, barely endurable work It was intransparent, what aspects were considered when grouping you with certain work. If he would have come up with the idea of thinking about it, he would have realized, that he was the only one who survived this amount of time in the print shop. Intelligence knows nothing, my dear friend. Intelligence really knows nothing. Infamy... Uncertainty... my friend. Interesting... Very interesting... Infamy... Uncertainty... Nonsense... Do you understand? Sure, I understand. Ignore... Simply ignore... Do you understand? Yes, I understand. I gave the permission for the organs, not the Monsignore. You? Bring me some dog's grease if you go to Steyr. I need to slather myself! Do you hear? Two big cans. Two big cans. Two. FILE OVERVIEW Without him knowing how it was possible, he was the one who could settle tensions between inmates and wardens, even tensions inbetween those groups. Yes, yes... I know. In two days you go home. Take care. Never in all this time, not one complaint was lodged against him. No one in the prison ever complained about him. Not the wardens... nor the inmates. No one was every angry with him, or even the slightest bit hostile towards him. Despite the rational, it was terrible for him to accept subordinance to the new power, to the fact of being an inmate, a criminal... a criminal existence at disposal for an unforeseeable period of time. He's got the skin of a child. He's afraid that in freedom, out of his convict uniform, he won't be able to write anymore, to think anymore. He is afraid that, in the fierce exposure of being discharged, he will be nothing. Before his discharge, he was called in to the director's office. He has to thank the director for his stay in the prison, said the warden. Yes? Prisoner 135, reporting for his discharge. Well well! Now it's your turn. Where do I have your file? Where do I have your file... Where do I have your file...? There it is! Kulterer, Fabian Hans, born 1912 in Aschach, correct? Yes, yes. Married, no children... Correct? Yes, yes. Your record is clean. You can consume your breakfast outside the cell. Outside! What will you do when you're discharged? Well, you know how you have to behave outside... The formalities are done. But when you're discharged... that doesn't mean... Yes, yes, I know. Thus, the formalities are done. OK, as far as I'm concerned. Tell me, aren't you the man with the writing permission? Small stories, et cetera... Paper, et cetera... Short, small stories, et cetera. Yes, yes. The fact of being modest proved advantageous for him. He had, like every human being, the desire in him to better his existence, to free himself from certain, seemingly constricted situations For the price of even the slightest act of violence, he didn't want to push himself to an achievement, that he, as he felt instinctively, did not deserve. Well, that was a very special privilege. To give a prisoner the permission to write. Many times it was just the wish, that it shall be about a house, that made him rise and sit down. Many times it was not even a thought like that, but only a sheer word. The word "Turnip" for example. The word "Altar". The word "Hoof". All words had the same meaning to him. But many conveyed him, right from the beginning, deep into a mysterious darkness... into the paradise of a ground color... and into figures and numbers... the precondition for writings. What was it that you wrote all this time? Eh... it's not worth talking about. Stories, probably. Yes... Stories. Do you want the money now or sent to you later? Where do you live? Do you go to your wife? Yes, yes. Well... You probably received our address materials. I'm sure there's a position for you somewhere. You could try it in a print shop. You'd have a good chance. It's astonishing, how much some people learn at our place. It really is astonishing. A man like you will be missed in our print shop. When you're discharged, you're not discharged yet, you will get your money. Well... Give this envelope to the police station in charge. The rest will go automatically. You know that you have to report every week at the police station, right? Kulterer says, he is very thankful. Not because it is the rule to say so, but because he honestly feels thankful, he says. He feels ashamed, not to have found better words. He had prepared a better farewell speech for the Director. But in the moment he had to voice it, the words were not to be found. All right. Kulterer has the feeling, the warden is well-disposed towards him. Strangly enough, he was never afraid of the warden. In contrast to the other inmates, who feared to be at his mercy in the darkness of the corridors. Did you give thanks? Yes, yes. How determined was here, what otherwise was strangled by hardship and insensitivity. How timidly he was able to think, in the isolation of the flat darklands, without any unnatural sounds. How to tell something as a truth, which otherwise is only known as a lie. He thought: Here I can state something, that is humane in the outside world! There is a relation between light and darkness in here, only that can claim thruth. If I leave, it is dead. Move it! Be happy that you can get some fresh air and a tan. He would have - hadn't he been the most withdrawn person, the most silent of all the inmates - talked constantly to himself, distinctly enough to hurt him and everything around him I will go away and kill myself. I will go and kill myself. But it's pointless, he said to himself. Tears. are existing, above all. Often they are merely a pink eye. Or sentimentality. Why is a crocodile said to have no tears? Tears are orgasm and christmas at once. Tears are allowed. Tears are thought of as ungracious. So we have to keep them... ...to cry. Kulterer was happy, that they were now interested in his stories, when, up to now, they didn't show any interest at all. Quite the opposite. THE DRY-DOCK THE LANDOWNER'S ADMINISTRATOR DEATHBED SLEEP LONELINESS I was clumsy. What do you mean? Too bad. You never had a bad experience with me. Yes, Yes. I know. Opprobrious beasts! Bastards! It's a fatal misunderstanding! Opprobrious beasts! You get your envelope back before you go home. Your farewell dinner! Come on! Serving foot is not a privilege! Tomorrow, our dear Kulterer will sleep in a nice, clean bed. Yes, yes. I know. He was convinced, that the warden did not try to be vile, but that he is well-disposed to him. He was always correct, always sound, never even a bit cowardice, although it may not seem so. Quite the opposite. Of course, he mustn't speak of himself in high terms like that, but he had the feeling that the warden was pleased with him. I'll give you a rope, so you can tie together your writings. The inmates believed, that this day was a happy day for him. They didn't know nor understand, that this day was the worst day of Kulterer's life. Tell us something before you go home. Stories or something. You tell us nothing... Now, when there are only a few hours left, he would be distancing himself from them? Why? They'd have nothing against him... Never had. Leave us a few of your stories. Leave us a few here. It seemed to him, that what they said was the agreed upon farewell of a person, they basically wanted to get rid of. For his cell mates he wrote aphorisms as well. For every one of them their own aphorism. What are you doing with the stories? Sell them! The papers would go crazy over them. Hold it. If they'd print these stories, that's the question. Yes, yes. They are sorry, that from now on they will have to go without him. Press. No one was able to flee, he thought. The idea of calculating with thoughts, like addition and substraction, came to him in the prison. The invention of human thought striked him to be the most precious gift. From this key moment on, the world was to him - through concentration and definite consciousness clearly predictable - a purifying one. Only now, there was ground beneath his feet, A heaven above earth. A hell. The rotation of an earth's axis ... without precedent. Hey. - Hey. Do you know the joke about the bank clerk who went up to the counter... He thought, anarchy would eliminate itself from left and right. In the last days before his release - that weighed painfully on his heart and mind, but without crushing him, making it's humane expression on his face - he seeked contact to his fellow inmates, often touchingly wishing to consolidate it once and for all. Every one of his actions were compelled by the word "Farewell". Your clothes. You too? Come on, get dressed. Undress! Come on. Come on! Get undressed! Get drunk when you get out. In fact, how did they catch you? Like that? Oh well. Did they hit you? Did you bleed? They hit you on the head... on the head. You know... They don't care. They hit you on the head. Everyone hits you on the head. Suddenly, he felt a horrible lonelines, coming over him, because he was stared at from all sides, unbearable. Your wife? How was she? How is she? What did she say? What did she do? Does she know when you'll get home? Did you write to her? He can get a good train at noon, they said. How much money has he left. If he has any left at all. Yes, yes. It's not easy to go outside. The world does not forgive, you know? Yes, yes. Sankt Sigmund, district Bruneck. I don't know the street. It's now all in italian, you know? Do you have relatives there? Yes. - Yes. OK, you? Vienna, 16. Quickly he wrote down their addresses and asked them to keep him in their thoughts. You? - Alt?tting in Bavaria. Bavaria. Take care! ZDF, ORF and the author would like to thank the Austrian Ministry of Justice for their good will, that made the shooting on location possible.
