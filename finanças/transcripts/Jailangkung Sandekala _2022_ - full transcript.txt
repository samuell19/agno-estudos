It's time. Are you sure about this? Honey, it's our only way to see Rania. We're in this together. We have to stick together for Rania. Let's do as she said. Okay? Okay? We have to find Rania. Yeah. We will find her. Read this out. Come on. Jailangkung... Jailangkung... we're having a party here. We're having a party here. A small party. A small party. Please come uninvitedly, Please come uninvitedly, and leave without being escorted. And leave without being escorted. Go on. Read it out. Jailangkung... Jailangkung... we're having a party here. We're having a party here. A small party. A small party. Please come uninvitedly, Please come uninvitedly, and leave without being escorted. And leave without being escorted. Mom. Dad. Rania? Rania? Mom. Dad. Dad. Rania? I can't see anything here. Dimas, don't. It's okay, honey. Dear? Rania? I can't see anything. Dad, help! Honey... I can't see anything. Dimas... Don't. Dimas! Dimas? Dimas! Dimas, wake up! ONE YEAR LATER Gosh. Have you opened it before? No biggie. Great! You're good? Of course. Do you need a hand? I could use some. Do the back tire please. Stop joking. Dad, let's go here. That's nice. Where is it? Over there. It's a nice place to take pictures. Let's see if we can get there before dark. Why don't you ask your sister to go there with you? She won't say yes. Just leave her here. Why did you say that? Jeez, that kid. That's your kid. What's that? Is that a cat or a dog? Or an otter? This is a civet. A dead civet. Haven't you ever seen a dead civet? Nope. It's been a week and she's still cranky. Just give her more time. Maybe we really should've taken the plane. An hour, tops. You can see that she's still mad at me, right? Four-hour trip and she never said anything to me. Sandra, we're on this road trip so you both can make up. Honey, could you step aside for a sec? I'm moving the car jack. More, please. This could be dangerous. Did I say something wrong to her? No, you didn't. Going to school in the UK is expensive. But she makes it seem like I'm not supportive of her. I guess it was just the wrong time. She called me by my name. I know. I already talked to her about it. What's that for? So noisy. You're getting on my nerves. Why so angry? Is she on her period or something? We can't go yet. Why? You're blocking me. Step aside. I'm almost done. Can I help you? Sure. Step on this. Step on it. We're going to the reservoir, right? Of course. Amazing. So cool. It's nothing special. Wow. This place is picturesque. Slow down. Why did they put a gate here? Careful. Be careful, Dad. Oh, Gosh... Gosh... You're too close to the edge. I know. I'm trying to align it. Watch the left side for me, honey. Are we good? Keep going. Kinan, hey! Kinan, get in. It's dangerous. Get in, sweetie. We're going through a gate. Get in, dear. Keep going. Keep going. Okay. Left side is clear. Okay. Watch your head. Okay. Let's go. Okay. This is actually cool. It's a good place to take pictures. It's a nice place. We can stop just for a while. Where should I park the car? Over there. Here is fine. Kinan, don't wander too far. Kinan, wait. Yay! Stop running, Kinan! I'm going to take pictures. Kinan! You can tell me anything, you know. I told you I didn't want to come. Yet you forced me to. It's a family road trip. You're still family, aren't you? You do have to come. I want to go on a solo trip. Next year we have a new family member. You're going to start college, probably out of town. It'll be hard to go on a trip together. Do you think Sandra will let me study out of town? My life depends on her now. Hey, watch your mouth. She's been your mom for ten years. She loves you dearly, Niki. You have to remember that. How about this? I'll figure out a way to help you study where you want. But please, I'm begging you. I want you to be more attentive and respect your mom. Okay? I'll try. I can't promise you anything. Kinan, stay off the edge. I know. You seem busy. I've talked to Niki. I hope she would listen to me. Niki! Go watch over your brother. Kinan. Don't run! Come on! Kinan! Hurry up! Kinan. Kinan, slow down. I'm tired. Come on. This is fun. Kinan. Let's go. Kinan? Kinan. Kinan? Kinan? Niki! I'm over here! It's amazing here. Jeez. Kinan! Kinan, what are you doing? The water looks deep. Stay off the edge. You don't want to fall in, do you? I can swim. Keep going and I'll tell dad. Go ahead and tell him. Alright, I need to go to the toilet. When I'm back, I want you to be right here. I'm warning you. Just go. Bye. Let's see. I'm at a lake now, and you can see the forest over there. Did I startle you? Totally. I thought nobody was around. Are you by yourself? No. I'm here with my sister. My dad and mom are at the parking lot. They are so far away. Is there fish down there? Fish? There's a lot here. How about crocodiles? There's the crocodile. Croc? I'm serious. Did I startle you? Sorry. It's getting dark, kid. You better go back. I want to shoot the sunset. Please don't. Alright then. Let me take you back. No, I'm okay. Are you sure? Alright. Niki? Where are you, Niki? Niki? Niki. Niki, where are you? Niki? Niki, where are you? Mom! Welcome to voicemail service. Welcome to voicemail service. Please record your voicemail. Please press any button to end your message. Kinan! Kinan! Well, I could. Okay. I will get it done when I get there. Okay. You promised there would be no work. I'm sorry, honey. I need to stop by the branch office. There's a paper to sign. You and the kids can go ahead and rest in the hotel. Dad. But where are they? Dad, have you seen Kinan? You went with him. I went to pee, and when I got back, he was gone. Unbelievable, Niki. Gosh. His phone is turned off. It goes straight to voicemail. I can't believe you left him. He's not in the car. Okay, you stay here. Come with me, Niki. Where were you? I told you to watch over him. It's getting dark. Straight ahead, dad. Kinan! Kinan! Dad, he went this way. Kinan! Be careful, dad. Kinan! Which way? This way. The last time I saw him, he was here. Why did you go this far? Kinan! Kinan! Kinan! Kinan! Kinan. Got any signal, Niki? Nothing. The signal is unstable in this area. Why did they have to search for him on the lake? Did he drown? They should be searching around here first. It's their procedure. What if we can't find him? Why did you leave him alone, Niki? That poor little kid. I needed to pee and it was not that long. You should have held it in. Calm down. How could you leave your brother alone in a place like this? Niki! It's beyond me! - A kid his age shouldn't be left alone. - Calm down, I'll talk to her. Calm down? Are you insane? Niki. Hey. It wasn't that long, dad. I didn't mean to leave him. I know. I'm not stupid. It's not your fault. Excuse me. I'm Majid. I'm with the police in charge of the situation. Adrian, Kinan's dad. And she's... Niki, my firstborn. She's the last person who saw Kinan. They went there, and she left him just to go to the toilet, and he was gone when she got back. Excuse me, but my son went missing over there, why are you searching... Sorry, Sir. It's our procedure. The first step. Can we talk? Just a minute. I'll talk with him. First, I want to say sorry and show deep condolence for your loss. Condolence? Hold on, what do you mean? What I'm trying to say is... No. Condolences are used for dead people. Sir, stop trying to be nice. Where the hell is my son? This place is not that big. So many people are searching. They should be able to cover the whole area. It's been seven hours and my son is nowhere to be found. Sir, we are here to help. I understand... if you really want to help, search the place he was last seen. Just like I said before... Not here. Just like I said before, it's the procedure. That guy before said that too. We've done our best, Sir. It's getting late, the weather is getting worse. What I can offer you now is... a place to stay. I'm not leaving before you find my son. Do you have any place to stay tonight? Look. The best option for you now is to stay at my official residence. It's close to the station and not far from here. Please consider it. Dang it! Ical. Hi, Uncle. POLICE I told you not to use it in full power. Yeah. Sorry. We have guests. Meet my nephew, Ical. Adrian. Ical. Sandra. Ical. Ical. Niki. Have you prepared the rooms? All set. Let me help you, Sir. Please come in. Your room's this way, Niki. I'm sorry for the mess. Okay. Good night. Sir, Ma'am. While we're here, the rest of the team is still searching. They'll call us if they find anything. It'd be good for you two... to get some sleep. So you can recharge yourselves for tomorrow's search. Copy that, return to base. Over. Mom? Mom? Kinan! Kinan. Kinan! You can sit here, Mom. Okay. Can I have some water, Niki? Here you go. Thanks. It's finished. I should have come searching alone. Don't worry, Mom. We will find Kinan. I saw a house over there. - We can ask for some water and rest there. - Yeah. Let's go, Mom. This way. Be careful. That's the house. Are you okay? I'm fine. Is that the house? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes? Hello. Are you looking to see someone? Excuse us, ma'am. Can we ask for some water? This lady here needs a place to rest. Please come in. Come. Please. I'm sorry, Miss. I just heard someone is missing. I thought they already found him. So, you've never seen my son? You've been walking too much. The baby is tired too. How are you feeling, Mom? Does it still hurt? A bit. May I? What should we do? It's going to rain. We should go back first. Let your mom stay here. We'll get the car and come pick her up. You give a good massage, ma'am. She's... This is nothing. Mom, Ical and I are going back to get the car. Just wait for us here because it's going to rain. We'll come to pick you up. Is that okay? Alright, dear. Thank you, Mom. Let's go. Hold on. Ma'am, is there any driveway around here? A driveway... Yes, over there. Just go uphill. You can park there. Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Take care. Yeah. Feeling better? Yeah. Ical, wait up. This way. It seems like it'll pour down. I know, wait for me. Which way? That's a dead end. This way. Are you sure this is the right way? I think so. Still a long way to go? I think we're almost there. You don't know the lady from before, do you? I even wonder why there's a house there. It's my dad. I've got a signal. I'll reply to him first. We're still pretty far away. Wait, I want to try something. I got a signal. I hope Kinan has the signal too. What do you mean? I can find his phone with this app. Why didn't you try this before? I did, but I couldn't get a signal. Niki? He's not too far away. Niki! Niki, are you sure this is the right way? Niki? We're getting close. Niki! The sound is coming from here. We should go. Something's not right. It's weird to see a doll here. Come on. What are you doing? Let's take this to the police. We should go now. This could be the kidnapper's. Niki... lcal, the sound is coming from beneath. No. Something's off, I'm sure of it. Ical, who knows if Kinan's phone fell down here. Ical! Help me! Ical, help me! Help me! What the heck is that? Niki! Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your mom? There's something in the forest. Did you find Kinan? Niki? Mom... Where's your mom? Back there. Let's go there. Wait, we can use the car. Alright. Here. What was that? I'm going right back. My son's been missing for two days. I have no clue how he's holding up out there. Take some rest. We'll be working nonstop to find Kinan. But for now, let's rest and fill up. I'm just scared that he got kidnapped. We don't know that for sure. I've worked with a lot of missing kid cases. Most of them are kidnapping. Clearly, there were witnesses. They demanded ransom money. Or left some traces behind. But not here. It's different. We have no trace. No witness. It's like your son just disappeared. Oh, one more thing. We see two patterns here. First, kids go missing at sunset. Second, when a kid goes missing, the previous missing kid will be found. Even though... we found them dead. I'm sure my son is still alive. Niki. Feeling better? That thing was grabbing onto my hand so tightly. It was also my first time seeing something like that. Hold on. It's my friend. Hey, bro. What's up? Ical. I saw the picture you sent me. It's the Jailangkung. You didn't fool around with it, did you? Nope, I just saw it. Good. If you ever find something like that, never play with it. You got it? It can summon things. And sometimes, they refuse to go back to their realm. What I sent to you is the real thing, right? Well, I think so. I'll call you again later. Careful, bro. Rama. He knows best about such things. He called me earlier today. He said people use the Jailangkung to summon things. It reminds me of when I first came here. The locals told me that the area around the lake is haunted. A lot of kids have gone missing there. Kids gone missing? Here. Look. In this video, I will show you the real deal. A wandering ghost. Let's check it out. Such nice fresh air here. I'm here with my friends. Hello, guys. We are by the lake. It's beautiful. Just look behind the tree. It's so beautiful here. They're supposed to be dating. Look! It's moving! What the...? That thing is tall. Let's rewind it. I'm sure that's not a human. Unbelievable. I bet it's the real deal, guys. And it showed itself before dark. There must be something off in... isn't this the dock where Kinan went missing? Yeah. Kinan... Niki? Mom, I'll be back soon. Niki? Niki, where are you? I'm on my way, but it is still a bit far. I'm with Ical. Are you there alone? Mom! Kinan? Mom! Kinan? Mom! Mom! Kinan! Kinan? Kinan? Kinan? Kinan? Help! Mom! Mom! Sandra? Kinan! Hey. Are you okay? You fell in the bathroom. Are you okay, honey? I saw Kinan in the bathroom. Kinan? I saw him in the corner. Sandra... You don't believe me? I know I saw him. You are too tired. You haven't got enough sleep. It made you hallucinate. No, I saw him! I know it's hard for all of us. But Majid and I have tried our best to find Kinan. We just haven't found him yet. I'm sure he's still out there. I'm not lying. I really saw him. I saw Kinan in the bathroom. You have to believe me. I'm not lying, Adrian. I really saw him. You have to believe me! Do you want some, sir? Ma'am. Hello. It's Saijah. Have you found him? No, we're still looking. So many are people helping. Do you want some gemblong? No thanks, ma'am. How is it over there? Well... They start deploying tracking dogs. I see. Hope we'll get this over soon. Okay, bye. Mr. Adrian. We actually have checked this person before. The person we're about to meet? Yes. We haven't checked his place. We are heading to their house? Yes. We should stop carrying around the Jailangkung. FOUND Rama was right. The forest, your hand being dragged down, then your mom started seeing things, seeing Kinan. I think this is the first case of all. Because the year here is the earliest. In the year 2000. 2000... It was 20 years ago. Hang on. The date she went missing was... It was in May 2015. She was five. Her name was Rania. FOUND Hold on. Check this out. It's very weird. Look at them. All the corpses of these kids... were found in the same condition. Let's have a sip, sir. Okay. POLICE Sir... I have told you everything. I only met him by the dock. I... I only talked to him a little. What did you talk about? You talked and did something naughty? No way. I said to him, "Hey, it's getting dark. Go home," something like that. I'm a good person, sir. This is confusing to me, sir. I'm confused. How so? Every year, people come to me and throw questions at me. Now you are here. Last time were Mr. Uhri, Mr. Karni, everyone... Mr. Sarno... Yeah? Calm down, okay? Calm down, I know. We're just here to ask you. Go ask... Where did you take this gentleman's son? I didn't take him anywhere. No, I didn't. Not anywhere. Nowhere. No, nowhere. I didn't take him anywhere. This is my son's jacket. I knew this is his jacket. It has his name here. Why do you have it here? No... it wasn't me. It's my son's jacket. Please, calm down. What did you do to my kid? No, I didn't do it! Mr. Sarno, stop it! Let me go! I said stop it! Don't move, dang it! Move it. Yeah? Hurry up. Move it, Sarno. Come with us. By the lake? Let's take him. He hit me. Thank you. They found a body. Dad? MORTUARY The body inside is... a girl. That means... It's not Kinan. So, Kinan's still alive, right? He's out there, right? Yes, honey. We're looking into it, okay? That means my son is still out there. We have to find out whether this kid has a connection to our case. There's a possibility that this girl was the missing kid from last year. From the same spot? Is that man involved? I'm not sure. That's why we still have to investigate further. We'll take the suspect to the crime scene. Now? Yes. I'm coming with you. No, Sandra, you stay put, okay? But... You need to rest. Just go back. I'll tell you what happened. This is Rania. The one went missing last year. Niki! Niki! I can't see anything! Kinan? Niki! Kinan... Niki! Kinan! Hey, what's wrong? Ical... I saw Kinan. He's inside. What? Kinan? I don't think that's him. That's not... No... He was right there! It's a girl. It's not Kinan. Why... Why is this thing here? No, Niki. Things are not going right, and this is the culprit. Your mom saw things, and now you. Ical! We don't have much time. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Hello, ma'am. I brought snacks for you. What for? They're Kinan's favorite. Just in case he comes across this place and he's hungry, you'll have something to give him. Please let me know when he does come. I understand. If he comes by, I will tell you right away. I will ask the neighbors to do so as well. Would you like a cup of tea? No, thanks. I'm going straight home. See? You can't keep walking. Gosh... Get some rest here, okay? This one is more active than his brother. Come inside. REGIONAL POLICE SECTOR EVIDENCE All of these belonged to the missing kids. The batik patterns look the same. Ical. It's exactly the same. What's this? A writing? What does it say? It's the Jailangkung spell. Rama told me, you need a spell to summon the Jailangkung. "Jailangkung. We're having a party here. A small party. Come uninvited. And leave without being escorted." Look. It's the exact same writing. This could be the reason those kids went missing. This must have something to do with Kinan's disappearance. Sit here, you dipshit! Ouch. Why are you here, Ical? Majid told me to get him something. This bike robber almost killed someone last night. I'm warning you. Watch him for a sec. I'll be back soon. Get me some water. I'm not done with you. Keep an eye on him. Do you live here by yourself? I live with my child. How many children do you have? Just one. Is it a girl? She's 17 years old. Where is she now? She... She's in her room. Inggi, what's wrong? She's not hungry. What's her name again? Inggi. So she has to walk a long way to school? She doesn't go to school anymore. I felt pity on her at school. Other students kept bullying her. Once, they threw rocks at her. Dang it. Hey, miss. Why so serious? What are you looking at? Your girl is kind of cute. Miss. Come sit on my lap. Watch your mouth. Shut it, you punk! You dare to talk just because I'm being cuffed. Fool. What did you say? What do you want? Say it again. You are brave just because I'm being cuffed. Hey! Turn it off. Go back there and sit down, okay? Hey! Niki? I heard Kinan's voice coming from there. Ical! Dang it! Dang it! What's that? What's going on, Ical? Is that a Jailangkung? What did it do? Is that real? It's real. How is it standing up? What's going on? Stay away from it. Ical! Dang it, scary. What the heck is that? Ical! Ical... Where did that man go? What is that thing? Niki? Niki! I'm scared. Kinan. Niki? Kinan. Niki. Niki! Don't! Niki! Niki? Ical? Ical? Ical? Show us the place. I have no clue, it was dark then. Why did you try to run away? Have mercy. You're such a hassle. Now tell us the truth. Where did you find the jacket? Here? Or there? Tell us. It's too far, he couldn't be stranded here. I'm not the one who took him. It was not me. Then who is it? You kidnapped that kid, right? Not me, sir. I didn't do it. It was a ghost. A ghost? Yes, sir. Unbelievable! Let me do it. Look at me. Where is the kid? Where are we, miss? How did we get out here? Where are we? I don't know! But I heard my brother's voice for sure. Your brother? What if we're dead? We're dead! Niki? Where are you? Kinan? Kinan. Kinan! Niki? I'm scared. I think my child is calling me. Help. Look at me. Where's the kid? I don't know. It's getting dark. I don't know. Where is the kid? It's lurking at night! I'll beat you up! It comes out after sunset! It comes out after sunset. They kidnap kids after sunset? It's not a person, it's a ghost. It's a ghost! Nonsense. Sir! Where is my son? I didn't do it, sir! That thing took your son! Calm down, sir. It took your son! We'll find him together. That ghost... Where is my son? He can't get out until he's dead! Calm down, Mr. Adrian. Mr. Adrian. Let go of the gun. Give me the gun. Niki! Kinan! Niki? It's coming. It's that ghost. Kinan! It's coming. Kinan! Hold him down. It's coming, sir! Where are you, son? Slow down, miss. There's something there. What is it? I don't see anything. It's a house. A house. What house? Kinan! Kinan! Dang it! Kinan? Mommy! Kinan? Kinan. What's that? Where's my Kinan? Your son is playing with my daughter. Since birth, Inggi had this odd condition. She's way taller than other kids. She's beautiful. You understand, do you? I'm only watching over my child. My beautiful child. But she often gets sad. Kids always bullied her. She wanted to make friends, but she got scared because they picked on her. That day, she left me a message. No, Inggi! Saying she couldn't stand it anymore. No, Inggi! Don't do it! Let's go home. She... She wanted to end her life. Hear me out, Inggi! Inggi! Inggi! It's the picture of my missing daughter. Inggi. I fetched her out from the lake. And I keep her here. I saw her crying. I asked a shaman. He said she's in a different realm now. And the shaman gave me this. A Jailangkung. Thanks to this, I'm happy I can be with her again. Right, sweetie? But only for a moment. When it's dark. She keeps asking for company. So, every nightfall, I get her a friend. I can only do that at sunset. She is so happy playing with kids her age. They stay with her. Mommy! Where's my son? What did you do to him? He can't come back anymore. He has to stay and play with my daughter. Hello? Niki! - It's me, Ical. Niki went out just now. - Ical! Come here, quick, Ical! To the house in the middle of the forest! This woman kidnapped Kinan! Come here, quick! Hurry! What the heck this? This woman kidnapped Kinan. Come quick, Ical! This house! What is it? It's the same house. Miss! My Gosh.. What's this all about? Let's get out of here. I have to find my brother. He's here. Niki? Dang it. Kinan? Let's go back. Miss... Dang it! What the heck is this place? Niki? Niki? Is that your brother? Kinan! Where are you, Kinan? Where are you, Niki? I can't see anything here. Is that your brother? Kinan? Niki? Kinan! You found him. Now let's get out of here! Kinan, what happened to your eyes? I want to go home. Cut me loose, Nik. Miss? I can't see anything. Hurry! Where are we? Miss, we must go now! Okay. Come on! Let's go! Let's get out of here. Come here. Stay here. Okay. I can't see anything. Stay calm, Kinan. Jailangkung. We're having a party here. A small party. Come uninvited. And leave without being escorted. Come on. Jailangkung. We're having a party here. A small party. Come uninvited. And leave without being escorted. Kinan? Niki? Mom! Niki! Kinan! Kinan! Mom! I can't see anything, mom. Kinan, what happened to your eyes? Mom! Niki. Mom! Mom! Kinan! Let him go! Let him go! Let go! Inggi! Come here, Kinan. Inggi! Inggi! Inggi. What have you done to her? Watch out! No! Mommy! Kinan! Kinan! Let go! Aunty! Ical, go help Niki. Kinan! Kinan, hang on. Help Kinan, Ical. Hurry and help him. Please. Let's get out of here! Which way? Which way? Quick! Uphill. Where's the car? Come on! Oh Gosh! Kinan. Careful, Ical. Slowly. It hurts, Mom. Stay strong, Kinan. Over there. Careful, Ical! Get inside. Hurry! Oh, God. Just get in the front seat. Quick! Hurry up! Where's the car key? Here. Quick, get the car moving. Hurry! Ical, hurry up! Niki, close the door! She's coming! Ical, hurry up! Come on! Mommy! Let go! Niki! Throw it away! Quick, throw it out! Move the car! Move the car! I'm sorry you have to see this. Because I need to file a report and just to make sure. Anyway, ma'am. According to your statement, you saw her daughter's body inside the house? Yes. I think she mummified the body. All good? Don't push this. You need to pull this out. Are you sure you don't want to give birth here? No, thanks. I'll mail the Jailangkung to your house. Ical... I will never forget you, Niki. Okay, that's enough. Ical and Niki... Kinan! Thank you, uncle. Thank you, Ical. Sure, aunty. Bye, Ical. Take care. Give it to me. I didn't take any picture. Jailangkung, Jailangkung. We're having a party here.
