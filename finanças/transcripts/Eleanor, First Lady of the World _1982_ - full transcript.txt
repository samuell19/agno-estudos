We're a half hour behind schedule. We can send someone round to pick up the rest of the things tomorrow. No. Have them picked up tonight. Mr. Truman said that you could take as much time as you needed. I promised myself I'd be out in a week, and tonight is one week exactly. It's nearly six. The car and the driver are waiting. We don't need a driver. We'll drive ourselves. I'm not First Lady any more. I'm just a private citizen now. Very well then. I'll tell them. -(WOMAN): Carol said that was the President's favorite. -(MAN): Yes ma'am. (KNOCKING) Yes, come in. I thought I might be able to help you carry a few things ma'am. You don't have to do that Mayes. -I wanted to, ma'am. -Thank you. The President did not... I want to thank you for the splendid service you provided us all these years. I hate to see you go ma'am. Yes, well, I'm sure you'll be very happy working for the Trumans. Now, if you will take these letters, and this small case, I'll send someone else up for the rest. Yes ma'am. I'll be down in just a moment. There's a bunch of reporters waiting out front to see you. Tell them the story is over. Yes ma'am. Mother? Oh... Anna. Nonsense,zing out here. it's a lovely autumn day. How was your flight? It was...all right. Are you hungry? What time is it in Seattle? They fed us on the plane. Tommy says you've decided to donate the big house to the government. -Well yes, we talked about that. -We talked about it? I didn't know you'd decided. Well this is what your father would have wanted, and you know I have no use for it. -Drink this, Anna. It will warm you up. -Thank you. So, tell me why the sudden urge to visit? I'm sure you didn't come 3,000 miles for my birthday. No. -Are you and Curtis having troubles again. -Yes, Mother. I didn't come to talk about that. I want to talk to you about your future. That's very kind of you dear. I really haven't made any definite plans. Well I think it's about time you retired from public life. I want you to have some time to yourself, you spent years being Pa's legs. Now you can simply retire, spend the rest of your life... Vegetating? My God, do you have to be useful and saintly every minute? Is that how I seem to you, Anna? Sometimes. What will you do? I don't know, but I'm sure you have a suggestion. I think the easiest thing would be for you to simplify your life. Close up the apartment in Washington Square and just go on living here the way you have been for the last five months. And do nothing? You could run the farm. I've had this conversation before. When? When your father contracted Polio his mother wanted him to give up his career in politics, and become a sort of gentleman farmer. Now I find myself not physically impaired but, emotionally shaky. I hope it's not a permanent condition. I don't feel quite ready to be put out to pasture. Mother, you're 61 years old. And assuming I live to be 62 I hope I have more to show in my final year that a pile of turnips. For the first time in your life you have time. You certainly had no time when we were growing up between your politics and your causes there was precious little of you for any of us. Oh, Anna, it's too late for that now. It's not too late for your grandchildren. Some of them see you more as a national monument than as a grandmother. Well, not having been a very good mother I don't suppose I'd be much better as a grandmother. I thought I could be of some help to you. That I could give you something. I came all the way out here just to get the door slammed in my face again. No. Anna, please. You don't even listen to what I say. You pass off everything as though I was one of your secretaries of something. The great lady Eleanor Roosevelt doesn't need anyone. Even when she's down she's a rock. You didn't even cry when Pa died! Oh yes, I cried. Not with us. Not in front of us. I am your only daughter and I have never seen you cry. I'm sorry I came. It's done no good. It's just upsetting. Excuse me. I have to freshen up before dinner. (SKIPPER):...so we took it to shore. They put it on the scale and it weighed over 14 pounds. (ELEANOR): My goodness, I didn't know salmon got that big. (SKIPPER): Dad said it was worth twelve dollars and fifty cents. I wanted to sell it but we ended up eating it instead. (ELEANOR): I had no idea you'd become such an expert fisherman. (TOMMY): Skipper, help me in the kitchen. -Sure. Thank you. (ANNA): Be careful with those. He's a good boy. You've done a fine job with him, Anna. I wonder if I should make the coffee? I'm sure Tommy is taking care of that. I suppose she has. Excuse me. (SINGING) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear grand mere. Happy birthday to you. What a surprise. You better hurry up. The wax is melting. Are you sure you counted the candles right? It looks like an awful lot to me. Don't forget to make a wish. (APPLAUSE) (SKIPPER): I'll get the presents. All right, Tommy, you cut the cake. There are tons more in the hall, but open the ones from us first. (ELEANOR LAUGHING) Ooh, this one's from Anna. Oh, it's lovely. Thank you dear. You can exchange it if you prefer something else. No, it's fine. Thank you. This one is from Tommy. (LAUGHING): Oh, what on earth... Wonderful! Where did you find it? Harrods. You're always complaining how those little American umbrellas couldn't keep a cat dry. Don't open it in the house, Mother, it's bad luck. This will cover you and me and Fala too. Oh, it's perfect. Thank you. Now mine. (LAUGHS) -It's too heavy for handkerchiefs. -Don't guess. Just open it. Walden , Henry David Thoreau. I'm sure she has a copy. We read it in school. It reminded me of you and your pond. It's the best gift that anyone has ever given me. Thank you dear. We have to get back to the city. I have a doctor's appointment first thing in the morning. Must you go so soon? I haven't even finished my cake yet. Go on. You can start the car and warm up the engine. I can? Great! Goodbye grand-mere . I'll write. I'll write to you too. Don't put it in gear. I'll wrap up some chocolate cake for the drive home. -That's not necessary. -When you're 16 chocolate cake is necessary. Goodbye Mother. I hope we'll be seeing you at Thanksgiving. Anna... If I seem distant to you it's certainly not my intention. What did you used to tell the road to hell was paved with? (CRYING) No.s all right. Just this once. Let it out. No, I can't. Who said, who said you're not allowed to cry? (CRYING) Anna! For God sakes, stop worrying about everyone else and allow yourself a little time for your own feelings. You're entitled. (ELEANOR CRYING) Mrs. Roosevelt? Telephone.? Take a message. I don't want to speak to anyone. But it's... Not anyone. I'm not at home. Very well, I'll tell the President. It's the President? Of the United States. Well, why didn't you say so? I'm terribly sorry to keep you waiting Mrs. Roosevelt the President will be with you in just a moment. I'm perfectly all right, my dear. Thank you. Have things changed much since you were here? Some. I think we used to have the cabbage rose rug in here. I don't remember why we called it cabbage rose. I suppose it's because the roses were the size of cabbages. But things do change, I shouldn't be surprised. Ms. Roosevelt, thank you for coming down. I'm at your service, Mr. President. I hope you had a pleasant drive. Yes, very, thank you. Please take my chair, it's more comfortable. No, this one will do very nicely. You know, I loved your letter about how I should joke with Stalin. Worked brilliantly. The same technique however, gets me nowhere with Churchill. Oh no. You'll find it works much better with Mr. Churchill if you talk to him about books. Let him quote to you from Barbara Frietchie. Or nonsense rhymes or Greek tragedy. The personal element means a great deal to him. I'm even more convinced I was right in choosing you. Choosing me? For what have I been chosen? To be one of my delegates to the United Nations. -Oh. -I think I finally surprised you. My dear Harry, I'm afraid you made a great mistake. I know I've surprised you. You haven't called me Harry since I was sworn into office. I'm sorry Mr. President I have no background in international law. And the Senate would never confirm me. Senator Bilbo says that my stand against discrimination is a little short of treason. Why not leave the Senate to me? No. I could not possibly accept. I considered all the possibilities carefully. I chose you. Why not think it over for a few days before you make a decision? As a personal favor? Very well. I'll think it over. But don't expect me to change my mind. I never take anything for granted from you Ms. Roosevelt. Let me know by Friday, that will soon enough. Oh good.l. Ms. Roosevelt, I want you to meet Durward Sandifer. How do you do Mr. Sandifer? Mrs. Roosevelt. This is truly an honor. If you choose to accept the position, Mr. Sandifer will be you advisor. I would have an advisor? Of course. You'd have the most expert advice in the country on all the issues. Mr. Sandifer would you mind seeing Ms. Roosevelt to her car before our meeting? It would be my pleasure, sir. Goodbye Ms. Roosevelt. -I'll speak with you on Friday. -Yes, thank you. God is on my side in this, you know. This way, Mrs. Roosevelt. I know the way Mr. Sandifer. Of course. I'm sorry. -That was a stupid thing to say. -That's all right. We make so many big mistakes in life it doesn't make sense to waste energy worrying over the little ones. Ms. Roosevelt, good afternoon. Yes, isn't it Mr. Dulles. Lovely hat. Thank you, I had no idea you were interested in fashion. I know it's a bit premature but if I were your advisor I would strongly urge you to accept the appointment at the UN. I'm afraid I don't have the experience for it Mr. Sandifer. Experience hasn't gotten us very far. We have plenty of expert politicians who see the UN as a power base for political leverage. Like Mr. Dulles? Exactly. But what the delegation really needs is some humanity. I think you're just what's called for. This way, Mr. Sandifer. You can't be serious. -I think she's an excellent choice. -She's an amateur. I'd say she's a breath of fresh air. I implore you to reconsider. Your considered may be premature. She hasn't accepted yet. Perhaps we'll be seeing each other in London, Mr. Dulles? Good luck, Mr. Sandifer. The Russians will bury her. Harry Truman only offered me the job the way I would offer a lollipop to a crying child. He feels sorry for me. You're probably right. They only want me because of Franklin. Out of admiration for him. Mmm hmm. I'm sure they'll find someone much better qualified. Probably. -I have no background in international law. -That's true. -Shall I get the President on the phone now. -Yes. There's no reason to put it off. Operator, this is Eleanor Roosevelt calling the White House. The President. Mmm hmm. He'll be right on. Hello, Mr. Truman. Just fine, thank you. And yourself? Fine. Yes. I've given it a great deal of thought and I've decided to accept. Yes. Thank you very much. All right. Goodbye, Mr. President. I sail for London in two weeks. I'll have to get our heavy coats out of storage. You are going to need new galoshes and woolen stockings. -I'll have to have them close up the house again. -Tommy... You'll be able to do your Christmas shopping in Harrods, you'll love that. As a neophyte lady delegate who is bound to be unpopular with certain Republicans I think I'd better travel as simply as possible. All right. We'll just take the black trunk and maybe some hand luggage. You may not even need the fur. I mean I think I should go alone. Well I can't arrive with an entourage. I'm sorry Tommy. How will you get along without me? I'm sure they'll have a pool of secretaries in London. I'm sure they will. But will they understand... "Note to CC, no on RB on the 17th, "Love 2W." Good luck. (REPORTER): Mr. Dulles, what do you think of the UN's vision of one world? I think... the vision of course is the ideal, but I'm afraid it's very unlikely to come about in the near future, or even in our generation. Then what's the purpose of the United Nations convening? An assembly meeting regularly to consider treaty revisions, colonial mandates, labor standards and so on can air problems that often result in war if left to fester in darkness. Dull, duller, Dulles. (TOMMY): Now remember, I packed your heavy underwear in the small suitcase... Uh-oh, I think we took the wrong turn. I hope they won't want a statement. (REPORTER): Mrs. Roosevelt, would you mind answering a few questions? -Well yes. -Wonderful! Step right this way if you would. We've been talking to Mr. Dulles and Senator Vandenburg here. (REPORTER 2): You can squeeze right in here Mrs. Roosevelt. (ELEANOR): Why hello Mr. Dulles. Welcome aboard Mrs. Roosevelt. Thank you Senator Vandenburg. (REPORTER): Do you have a statement for us Mrs. Roosevelt? Well, I believe the United Nations to be our one hope for a peaceful world. My husband placed tremendous importance on it and I consider it a great responsibility and honor to be a delegate. What do you think are your chances for success? We have all been plunged into a new world. If the atomic bomb did nothing more, it scared us into realizing that we must do something about preventing war. Or there might be a morning when we won't wake up. (SANDIFER): This way Mrs. Roosevelt. (GROUP CLAMOR) Allow me to take this. Perfect.I? Well, what did you think of that? It's like competing for coverage with a film star. In my opinion, she's the worst possible appointment to the United Nations. She's more dangerous than the Russians. Not an overstatement. She's so naive. That's the danger. Good.on't last. I don't look forward to having to listen to that school girl voice on a daily basis. I've unpacked things in the same order as in your dresser at home so you should be able to find everything. Except your hankies are in the nightstand. I'll be fine. Go along now. Or you'll be stuck in mid-Atlantic without your comfortable shoes. All right. I'm going. Oh I also packed enough talcum and tooth powder to last a lifetime but if you run out I'll send more. Thank you. The whistle sounded ages ago. If you stow away there will be gossip. I'll show you the way Miss Thompson. If you need me, cable. I'll be on the next boat. Goodbye Tommy. Goodbye Mrs. Roosevelt. Scoot. If you want anything I'm four cabins down to the left. Never any trouble. Yes, yes. Thank you. When we get to the main salon, go through the center doors and to your right. Goodbye. Take good care of her. I'll try. It's just such a great responsibility. -It's overwhelming. -Just be frank with her. She will tell you what she needs. Sometimes she just needs to be left alone. All right. I'll do my best. She's a very big person. She's just about the biggest person in the world. Anything that I can do to help her justifies my existence. Goodbye, Mr. Sandifer. (KNOCKING) Who is it? Durward Sandifer. I'm sorry. I noticed your light was still on. -I thought you might like some cocoa. -Thank you. Please, come in. Can't you sleep. I haven't tried. Do sit down. Our first meeting is in the morning and I've been trying to get through these documents. I'm having a very rough time with some of them. Maybe I can be of some help? I can't make head nor tail of this one. Oh yes. I remember this one. It's all double talk. Double talk? Bureaucracy at its most outrageous. None of us really understands a word of it. Oh I feel much better. I may not know international law, but after 13 years in the White House, I certainly understand bureaucracy. Well there's no way to keep her off a committee. She's a delegate. And not just any delegate. There's this ridiculous aura that surrounds the Roosevelt name. When she speaks some people think she's talking from Mount Olympus. I think maybe I have an idea. Thank you. Wonderful weather, isn't it gentlemen? It's a bit cold for my taste. Mr. Dulles and I were just discussing your place on the delegation. I've decided to ask you to serve on committee three. Well naturally I am anxious to work wherever I can do the most good but I'm ashamed to admit I don't remember reading the duties of committee three. It's the humanitarian committee. Humanitarian. They could all be called that, couldn't they? Perhaps Mr. Sandifer here can explain committee three to Mrs. Roosevelt? You'll excuse us. What exactly is committee three? It's um, well it's new. Oh. Could it by any chance have been created just for me? Well, I wouldn't put it quite that way. It is an area of your expertise. Humanitarian problems. Huh. And that's committee three. It can be. It can be? Are you telling me it has no agenda? Well I... No. It has no agenda. (SIGHS) I can just hear them. ''Where can we put Mrs. Roosevelt? What does the poor woman know?'' ''Ah, but wait. Here's a safe spot for her. Committee three.'' ''She can't do much harm there.'' I know how you feel Mrs. Roosevelt. I doubt it, Mr. Sandifer. I doubt it very much. Good morning Mrs. Roosevelt. Good morning. -We're moving a bit this morning. -More than a bit, I'd say. It is the weather that separates the seamen from the yachtsmen, as they say at Portsmouth. If that's so then my husband was the exception. He was a yachtsman, and he had a stomach that could weather any storm. You husband meant a great deal to us. Thank you. Perhaps the fresh strawberries to start? That would be lovely. And then an omlette? No thank you. Just my usual three minute eggs and toast and tea. Very good Mrs. Roosevelt. Good morning Mrs. Roosevelt. Good morning. Is there something I can do for you? Well my shipmates reckoned I should be the spokesman. We're honored to have you aboard. Why thank you. You probably don't remember, Mrs. Roosevelt, but in 1942 you came up to Liverpool and cheered us up before we shipped out. How nice of you to remember. I'll never forget it. You went every place we did. You know we used to have a joke. Whenever anybody would say ''when are we going to invade France?'' Well then somebody else would say, ''as soon as Eleanor clears a beach head.'' You know I had your picture posted up in my locker. Right next to Betty Grable. Did you really? And I looked at your picture almost as much as I looked at hers. Good morning, sir. Good morning, Mr. Dulles. Purely a figure of speech, Mrs. Roosevelt. Do be sure to try the croissants. They are just oozing butter this morning. (CHEERING) (MAN): Welcome madam. Lovely to see you madam. (WOMAN): Did you see her bag? It didn't even match. I didn't realize she was as tall as that. Your key madam. Will there be anything further? No, thank you. Thank you, madam. -It's as cold in here as it is in my room. -There's a fuel shortage. I know, but the hotel had explicit instructions to have a fire going before you arrived. After all, as our only lady delegate... I need no special treatment, Mr. Sandifer. And incidentally I find the absence of other women delegates an outrage. Right. See you in the morning. (KNOCKING) Stella.! Didn't you get my message? I only just arrived. -Let me get a look at you. It's so good to see a friend. How are you, my dear? I'm fine. You'd say you were fine if you'd been run over by a bus. (LAUGHS) Sit down. I'll have some tea brought up. Never mind about the tea. Tell me, how are you, really? A bit confused. In transition I think between First Lady and this new job. Yes, I remember when I was first widowed, before I took my place in the House of Lords, it's a bit sticky. But you'll get on splendidly. The truth is I feel unwanted, unwelcome. Don't be ridiculous. Everyone adores you. Oh no, not everyone. I feel as if I'm surrounded by enemies. Rubbish. I want you to come home with me. I have a project for you. It will make your enemies sit up and take notice. Get you coat. But I haven't even unpacked. That can wait. Unless of course you're too tired? No, I'm not a bit tired. Good. I saw your press outside. They consider you the queen mother of authorities. Let's take the back stairs. Just like old times. Lead on. What's all this about enemies? The republicans see me a less an American than a democrat. They tucked me away in a humanitarian committee where I'll do the least harm. It hasn't even got an agenda. That's wonderful. You can create your own agenda. Yes. If only I felt the least bit qualified to do so. Don't try to play the sheltered widow with me, my girl. Oh no we've known each other too long for that. When I took my seat in the Lords I discovered I knew every bit as much as my husband did. -Possibly more. -Oh yes, but that's not true for me. I was Franklin's legs at home, not abroad. Somehow I got the impression it was you I saw here in 1942. Visiting with King George. Touring the country. Studying my Woman's volunteer services so you could do the same in the United States. (CHUCKLING) And running poor little Churchill's legs off. (ELEANOR LAUGHS) You've made your point. I've been using these films to elicit funds for my work. They should give you a pretty clear idea of the situation we're dealing with. Millions of people have been displaced by the war. It is the greatest human problem the world has ever known. No one knows what to do with them. Poles, French, Belgians, Russians. There's not enough food for the people who remain in their villages. The refugees are literally starving. 350,000 fled to the United Kingdom. We have over 1,000 children from concentration camps who have lost their parents. And that's only a small part of the problem across all of Europe. 10 million people are virtually homeless. Families have been torn apart. Whole cities no longer exist. Wiped out by bombs and fire. The survivors are wondering aimlessly through Europe. They've no place to go. I've seen these films 50 times. Every time I have the same emotional response. I've read about the situation, of course. -but to see the faces... What's being done? -Oh not enough. Most of their homes were destroyed in the war. Now because they don't want to go back to their own countries they're considered traitors. If we sent them back, there's a danger that they would be ill-treated, if not virtually imprisoned. Or executed. I'll do anything I can to help. (HORN HONKS) Now, careful of your footing. It's all right. Just one more flight. Oh. Now be careful of that step. Oh! They're all over the place. (BABY CRYING) They're jammed in here like sardines. (KNOCKS) Hennie? (KNOCKS) Hennie it's Lady Reading. The lady with the funny hats. You remember. I brought another lady with a funny hat. She's come all the way from the United States just to meet you. May we come in? Frau Reading , Bitte schon. There is no water here any more. What happened? The pipes cracked. And they turned off the water. Show me where the pipes cracked. I'll see what can be done. (MAN SPEAKING GERMAN) You and Hennie get to know each other. I'll be back as quickly as I can. What is your name, dear? Ich heisse Frau Roosevelt. Wie heisst du? (MAKING ANIMAL NOISES) The cold, the hungry and the homeless do not belong to any one nation, they belong to all of us. As the committee addressing the issue of human rights it seems to me that our first duty is to draw up a bill of rights. A Magna Carta if you will, to ensure these basic human rights for all the peoples of the world. Mrs. Roosevelt, do you know what you're proposing? You'd have to get over 50 nations which are politically, socially and philosophically diverse to agree on which rights their people should be given. It would probably take them 10 years just to get them all to agree on a single definition. I grant you that it will be a very difficult task, but not an impossible one. I believe this is clearly what is most needed in the world. And what must be done, can be done. (DOOR KNOCKING) Mr. Sanderford. Dulles and Vandenburg are waiting over. I ran up the stairs so I'd have time to brief you. What happened? Russia has chosen Andrei Vyshinsky to speak against you on the displaced persons issue in the general assembly. Good Lord what an opponent. Yes but more importanly is that this will be the key issue of the whole session. Oh dear! It's wonderful! They thought they were tucking you away in a harmless little humanitarian committee and you turn out to be the key speaker on the primary issue! (DOOR KNOCKING) Here they are. Don't let them bluff you, you have all the aces! -Good afternoon gentlemen. -Good afternoon Mrs. Roosevelt. -Please come in. -Mr. Sandifer. Mrs. Roosevelt. Do sit down! Thank you! Well, what prompts this surprise visit? We've just been informed that Vyshinsky will be debating the displaced persons issue for the Russians. Yes. Well, it is essential that we make a very strong showing on this issue. We recognize you've done a great deal of work in this area Mrs. Roosevelt. -But it isn't... -It isn't that we feel you aren't qualified to speak... We must put our first string quarter back in during a crisis. And who do yo propose for this first string quarter back? Well, Senator Vandenburg or I would be willing to step in and deliver your speech before the General Assembly. Deliver my speech? Oh I'm sorry gentlemen, I don't have one. Well, well surely you must have prepared... Oh yes, I prepared in depth, but I haven't written a speech. I planned to speak extemporaneously. What? Good Lord. You can't be serious! This isn't a ladies' luncheon. It's a plenary session of the United Nations! Believe me gentlemen, nobody knows the human suffering behind this issue better than I do. Mrs. Roosevelt, I must insist that either Senator... Insist? Mr. Sandifer, what is the usual practice in these matters? It's customary for the person who handles the subject in the committee to present it in the plenary session. It's Mrs. Roosevelt's right to do so. And I shall. Now, if you'll excuse me gentlemen, I have a great deal of work to do. Well, Mrs. Roosevelt, I feel that you're making a critical error. Good luck to you. And to us all. You were wonderful! I only hope I'm doing the right thing. If we went to the displaced persons' issue tomorrow, the door will be wide open for the Declaration of Human Rights. What's the point of my having lured you down to dinner if you're not enjoying it? I shouldn't have let you do it. I could have had a sandwich in my room. Nonsense. It takes a clear head and a full stomach to make a brilliant speech. Yes. I suppose I will need stamina the Russians are planning to filibuster, delay the vote on the displaced persons until so late that some of our allies will get tired and leave. Well you'll simply have to be so spellbinding that no one will leave! How will you do it? I don't know, but I have learned a few tricks over the years. If I can just control my voice. Yeah. You do tend to be a bit soprano . Coloratura will be more like it. When I get nervous I sound like a turkey gobbling. (LAUGHS) Uh oh! (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (WHISPERING IN ARABIC) (APPLAUSE) You're on! (SPEAKING SPANISH) -I would like to speak to you tonight... -There's your school girl. I would like to speak to you about Simon Bolivar. Bolivar was a great man. He stood for the liberty of all people. He believed in the dignity of the individual. Were he still alive, were he here with us tonight, he and all the people of the great South American continent would vote for the right of each citizen of the world, to choose his own destiny. People of Peru and Colombia and Brazil know what it is to live under the whip. They know too the sweet taste of freedom. They and I ask that this Assembly accord that privilege to the displaced persons of the world. (VICTORIOUS MUSIC) You know we could open a florist's shop with all these. South American delegation. Oh how nice! John Foster Dulles, that's amazing! Congratulations, you made a friend out of a potential enemy. I wish I could believe that. What does he say? "John Foster Dulles." What, no message? Just "John Foster Dulles"? Perhaps he thinks that's praise enough. (LAUGHS) Now that's chutzpah! Chutzpah? It's a Yiddish word. It means arrogance. No, no that's not quite it... Oh let me give you an example. If a man kills both his parents then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan, that's chutzpah! (LAUGHS) Ah oh I see! Just like you. Taking on the great Vyshinsky and beating him. Or me: a woman, a Jew, a commoner, taking my seat in the house of Lords. Did you see the look on that Vyshinsky's face when the Brazilian delegate decided to sit down again? (LAUGHS) I was too busy praying that you'd stop gobbling and become a bass. (LAUGHING) Thank heavens Mr. Dulles can't hear me now or he'd want his card back! (LAUGHING) There's my all ashore, I'd better go. -I couldn't have done it without you. -Nonsense! You've moved mountains. No I just moved a small pebble now we have to draft the Declaration of Human Rights before the next session. Well, you will do it too! You're in your element my dear. Aww, I'm very proud of you. Thank you, goodbye Stella. Bon voyage! Mother, please. You've been working on the Declaration for the last two years can't you at least take an hour off and come to your own party? Yes dear, I'll be over in a minute. You will make yourself ill. No, nonsense I'm in perfect health. Is the ice cream ready? I don't know, Buzz is working on it. The ice cream is my department I'll tell you when it's ready. I'll be over in just a minute, I promise. Let me show you how that's done. But the last time you made it, it was too sweet. There is no such thing. Scoot. -This is supposed to be a party. -Well, isn't it? No! Emily Post says one is allowed to have any fun until the guest of honor arrives. Besides you're the only one who knows how to burn the hot dogs right. (LAUGHS) I beg your pardon. The work can wait. -Finally! -I hope I haven't missed anything. James has just announced he's considering running for Congress. Hey, it's not official yet. Why James, that's wonderful. If it feels right to you. I think between the family name and my experience in the White House when Pa was alive, I'll have a pretty good chance. Well, you have my blessing, but it won't be easy. The Roosevelt name carries a tremendous built-in burden. They'll expect you to be your father. I know that. Will you support me? Of course, I will do everything I can. Buzz, ready? Mother, will you campaign with me? I have my hands filled right at the moment with my own campaign chairing Committee 3. Do you have any idea what your support will mean to me in terms of votes? Getting votes is easy James. Being a good Congressman is not. Children! Hot dogs are ready! I want to hear about Paris. Are you all ready? When are you sailing? Next week. This time I'm going in style taking Tommy with me. I suppose we're as ready as we'll ever be. The draft, the Declaration is finished. I just pray it passes before the election. Why? Because Mr. Dewey's the overwhelming favorite, and if he wins the presidency, John Foster Dulles will become Secretary of State and I'll be back raising turnips. Ah you'll get it passed, I know you will. I wish I had more staunch supporters like you in Paris. Why don't you come? Are you kidding? I'd love to! He starts college next week in case it slipped your mind. I could start next semester. -Could he possibly come then? -Mother! Why did you suggest anything so irresponsible? What's the harm in one semester off? He's worked very hard at his military academy. Uncles do not get a vote in this. But you know what Hemingway said, "to have lived in Paris as a young man is a movable feast." -This is ridiculous. -Mother I'm eighteen years old, I'm not a child. I promise to have him home for Christmas. Well you'll have to go to Abercrombie's first you don't have any of the right clothes. Mother! You're a peach! I'll have to get Tommy to arrange a passport for you. Here dear, you take over. Tommy! -Will you look at the two of them? -Aren't they a picture? If I weren't a sophisticated mature adult I'd probably be jealous of that kid. Thank heavens we're beyond all that. Would you like a drink? I'd love one. (ELEANOR): You know I envy you. Nothing that happens later ever equals the intensity of the first time. I was a year younger than you are now when I sailed past that statue on my way to Europe for the first time. I remember looking at her and telling myself that tall ungainly girls might become dignified with time. (CHUCKLES). I don't think I ever really believed it, -but I was so frightened I had to try. -Frightened? You? -Of course, I was always frightened. I still am. -Now what's there to be -frightened of? -You sound just like your grandfather. When we danced together for the first time at a party in Hyde Park I was so awkward I stepped on his foot. I began to apologize. He looked at me and smiled and said, "you're frightened, aren't you?" And I said that I was. He said, "fear is an illusion. If you use the same energy to be confident, the most wonderful things happen." And did it work? Yes, I suppose it did. Comment allez-vous? Oh, um... tres bien merci. Merci. Je vous en prie. -Est-ce qu'il fait beau aujourd'hui? -Ah oui! Il fait tres, tres beau! -Ooh, bien! (LAUGHING) -Mais j'ai froid . (CROWD CHEERING) (MAN) Please, Madame . (REPORTER) What is your biggest... excuse me... Ah, here you are. Welcome to Paris. Doctor Malik. May I present my grandson, Curtis. Delighted. And this is my secretary, Miss Thompson. This is Dr. Charles Malik, the representative from Lebanon. Delighted to me. Here is the agenda. We must work quickly. The first session is at nine tomorrow morning. Thank you. Rest well. Madame Roosevelt, soyez la bienvenue. Merci, monsieur Berger. Your rooms are ready, and there are many messages... Oh it's been such a long day. If you'll just give us our key, my grandson will attend to the registration and any other details. I really would appreciate it. Certainement, grand-mere. It is a joy to see Madame again. Unfortunately there are shortages but we do our best. I'm sure you do. We'll manage. What shall I do with your messages? Why, send them up, of course. Oh my! Did somebody die? How lovely. Why didn't you let me handle the registration? Since you dragged me all the way to Europe, you could at least let me do my job. If you want young people to act responsibly you give them responsibilities and trust them to carry them out. That's the Rue Royale. Franklin and I walked along that street. That was springtime and you were young. This is October and it is freezing in here. It was a wonderful time. Of course it was. It was your honeymoon. Well, it was really our second honeymoon. The first we spent in Hyde Park. Can you imagine being 21 and in Paris with the man you love. (KNOCKING AT THE DOOR) Just let me handle this. Oui! Qu'est-ce qu'il faut faire avec les lettres? Donnez los letters ici, see-voo-play. Pardon, madame. Amenez-les ici, s'il vous plait. That! That! No, I thought we left all this behind us. Oh! You better tip him right away before he brings in any more. Ici. Merci madame. Everything's taken care of. Oh! Looks like you've got a lot of work to do. No, no, not today. Today I'm going to show you Paris. Put your feet up, and we'll deal with these when we get back. Ah, fantastique! Uh-hmmm!believe it. A bientot! What an incredible day. Yes, even when I was here with your grandfather, I never climbed so many steps. Ah, well I feel wonderful. How about you? Are you happy? Well I suppose that word means different things to different people. What does it mean to you? Well, I know that you might think this sounds a bit stuffy but I'm happiest when I have a job to do that's worth doing. When I'm accomplishing something. (MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Je ne vous comprend pas, monsieur. Qu'est ce que vous voulez? May I be of help? Madame Roosevelt. Dr. Pavlov. May I introduce my grandson. Curtis, this is Dr. Pavlov of the Russian delegation. How do you, Dr. Pavlov? I'm not very well at the moment, I'm afraid. We seem to have reached an impasse. All I want is something for my stomach. And suddenly it's an international incident. I know exactly what the problem is. What you need is lemon. Lemon! Du jus de citron dans un verre d'eau de Vichy, s'il vous plait. Oui madame. It is the change in the water. Yes, I understand. We'll have you right in no time. Bonjour. Est-ce qu'il y a des lettres pour monsieur Dulles, s'il vous plait? (DR. PAVLOV) I am most grateful. I feel better already. Good afternoon, Dr. Pavlov. Mr. Dulles. Du papier s'il vous plait. Make sure you have another glass just before bedtime. I'll make a note of the French for you. (PHOTOGRAPHER) Would you turn this way for a picture, please. Thank you! Madame Roosevelt, I would consider it an honor if you would join us at the ball at the Russian embassy tonight, in celebration of the October revolution. Bring your grandson. Thank you, that's very kind of you. Good afternoon. Charming man. First impressions can be quite deceptive. I have some unpleasant news, Mrs. Roosevelt. I understand the committee intends to review the Declaration word by word. But that could take months. We may never be able to get each delegate to agree on every word. Perhaps not. By the way... I would suggest you avoid being photographed with the Russians in the future. Don't let them manipulate you. They want the world to think they're anxious to cooperate. And what do the Americans want the world to think, Mr. Dulles? Just take my advice, Mrs. Roosevelt, avoid the Russians. You dance like a ballerina. Thank you. What a shame we cannot just dance and eat and love. Oh! People have such a great capacity for pleasure. How sad we spend most of our time being unpleasant to each other. Of course, some people are more unpleasant than others. Your Mr. Dulles... Perhaps we should just dance. You're right. No politics tonight. Tonight we just enjoy ourselves. Thank you. Charmant, n'est-ce pas? D'accord. A most wonderful extravaganza, Dr. Pavlov. I must congratulate you. Only because it is graced by such eminent personages. Most kind. May I have the next dance, Madame Roosevelt? It would be a pleasure. The Russians really do know how to celebrate. Did you ever see so much caviar? Yes, indeed, but, eh... beware of the scorpion in the cradle. What do you mean? I know you're upset by the committee's decision to review the Declaration word by word but it is merely a delaying tactic. By Pavlov? You see the way the Russians see it, if they can delay till Truman loses the election you will simply disappear. And so would the Declaration. (PAVLOV LAUGHING) (KNOCKING AT THE DOOR) That slimy snake in the grass. Who? He thinks he can twirl me around the dance floor. Like some silly, simpering school girl and walk all over my life's work. Pavlov. That pompous Russian wolfhound. I cannot be distracted by hand kissing and champagne. What are you gonna do? I'm going to do what any good general would do. I'm going to regroup, find a new strategy, and counter attack. See if Dr. Malik is back at his room yet. Monsieur Malik, s'il vous plait. What happened? Why did she leave the party? Shh, the general is planning a counter attack. Dr. Malik, I hope you haven't retired yet. I would like to ask you a personal favor. Tomorrow morning, in committee I would like you to make a motion. In the interest of productivity I move that the discussion of each point of the Declaration be limited to ten minutes for each delegate. I'll second that. Excellent suggestion. All those in favor? Motion carried. Now, we can move on to the discussion of Article 17. Dr. Pavlov? I would like to go back to Article 1. "Whereas all men are cre... "Whereas all men are created..." We feel that the word "created" implies the existence of a deity. The Soviet position on this is well known. And we feel strongly that this phrasing is unacceptable. It favors the western world's philosophy. This should by no means be a religious document. Unless every such reference can be eradicated, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can in no way support such a document. Did you buy your mother's Christmas present? Yes, I thought it should be something very French, so I got her a beret. Oh she'll get you for that. No I really got her this silk scarf. Lovely! It's her favorite color. You have special knack of choosing just the right gifts. Only for the people I love. Do you think the election results are in yet? I don't know. Will Mr. Dulles ask you to resign as soon as he hears that Truman's lost. No, he's too much of a gentleman for that. But he'll expect it. Will you give it to him? I won't have any choice. Here you run along, and take this bag back to the hotel for me. Okay, good luck. Don't peek. I am quite aware of the time difference in New York but we should have received that cable by now. -Good morning, gentlemen. -Good morning, Madame Roosevelt. I see everybody is early this morning. We ought to be able to do a lot of work today. We may even be able to put aside the Declaration and move on to more pressing matters. We have an old saying in my country, Dr. Pavlov, "Don't count your chickens before they hatch." I have heard such a saying. But I believe it was "Do not put all your eggs in one basket." Excuse me. (DULLES) Non, operator, je voulais New York. Whose briefcase is this? JFD Mr. Dulles isn't wasting any time in taking over. The election results aren't even in yet, are they? No, that's the most blatantly pompous thing I've ever seen. (DULLES) Oui, New York. I have New York here, Mr. Dulles. Yes, Dulles here. (DULLES) What? I can't hear you. What? This is a terrible connection. You must speak louder. We've won. (DULLES) Mr. Dewey's been elected. (SECRETARY) Wonderful! Congratulations! I'm so sorry Madame Roosevelt. That's history, Mr. Malik. It has a way of charting its own course. No matter how hard we may try to change it. Congratulations, Mr. Dulles. Thank you Mrs. Roosevelt. Telegram for Mr. Dulles. Mr. Dulles, I have the cable. Ah, now it's official. Excuse me. What is it, Mr. Dulles? Mr. Truman has been re-elected. Well, if everybody isn't too excited perhaps we'd better get down to work. I think we can get through a section of the Declaration before the end of the day. Is this yours, Mr. Dulles? Thank you. You've still got a long way to go Mrs. Roosevelt. You've got to get 56 nations to ratify before the session's end six weeks from now. I'm well aware of that, Mr. Dulles. (GAVEL BANGING) If everybody would please come to order. I believe if we work very hard we can all be home for Christmas. (MAN) Hear, hear. One other thing is troubling to us about this Declaration. What is that, Madam Jahan? The phrasing, "All men are born free and equal." In our countries, women do not have the same rights as men. Well in English, the term "all men" is intended to mean "all people". Yes, that is very clear sitting here with you now. But when we go home, if it says "all men" it will mean just that... "men." I understand your concern. Would it be acceptable if it read "all human beings are born free and equal"? Yes. That would be most acceptable. I believe with this change we will all be able to support this Declaration. Thank you for your contribution, Madam Jahan. It will ensure that women are not overlooked. Quatre cent trente neuf, s'il vous plait. Is the tea party over yet? Okay. -Good night, Madam Roosevelt. -Good night Madam Jahan and thank you. Good night. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I'm exhausted. I'm starving. Well you passed out sandwiches, why didn't you eat? I'm always afraid we'll run out and lose Brazil or Siam. I must have poured 1,000 cups of tea in the last month, but it was worth it. Women are more realistic than men. I think I accomplish more with these teas than I could ever hope to in the meetings. Maybe so but I would trade in this whole pot of tea for one dry martini. Bonjour mes cheres amies. Le voila, comment ca va? Ah, magnifique! I saw the sewers from Les Miserables. And the Pont Neuf where Cyrano singlehandedly killed 100 men. Oh! And for tonight I have a surprise. Good! Tell us. We're all ears. Well, mother wired me some money. Oh she needn't have. I certainly can take care of my grandson. She just wants to feel like she's doing her bit. Anyway, I wanna take us out tonight, all of us, and don't say no. I want to thank you both for the most wonderful month of my life. Well, you have to say yes. It's a dying man's request. You're not dying. I know, but in case you're not around when I'm dying, I'm making my request early. Okay, say you'll come. Enchante'e. Madame, monsieur. Now, what would you like for dessert? They have mousse au chocolat and creme caramel. Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't manage another bite. No, no, no, we have to. This is the last time. Well, at least give me a few minutes to digest that elegant canard. I thought you had duck. Maybe a dance will help you work up an appetite. Shall we? Well, I might try waddling around the floor. Oh good. The waddle's the next best thing to the waltz . Would you care to dance, Miss Thompson? Oh no, I don't even think I could manage a waddle. Oh, thank you. I'm eternally grateful. I'm sending Tommy home with you. I can travel on my own. I know. But the roughest patch is over, here, and we should have pretty smooth sailing until Friday. Then I'll be coming home myself. Well, why don't we wait and come home with you? Because I promised your mother. Besides I want Tommy to open up Val-Kill and have it ready for the holidays. All right. I want you to know that I really meant what I said before. About this being the happiest month of my life. And it's mostly because I've gotten to know you better than I ever have. I'll never forget it. My dear boy, neither will I. Well, that's it. Yes, nothing left but the final vote. Tomorrow morning by half past nine, it'll all be over, one way or another. You know something? Ever since I came here, I've been promising myself that if we win I'm going to take a running slide down this hallway. I can't wait to see you do it. I'll get the minutes. Madam Roosevelt Madam Jahan. There is a matter of grave importance. I have searched my conscience and my soul. And I find that I cannot support a Declaration that does not include the deity. Do you know what you're saying? I do. For that reason I have not yet spoken of this to my delegation. I wanted to tell you first. If you broach this issue now, other nations will be compelled to join you. It'll destroy all our work. Then perhaps our work has not been correct. I ask you to consider, if you were in my place. Wouldn't you listen to your conscience? (KNOCKING AT THE DOOR) Surprise! I've come for your big moment. I'm sorry, Stella. I've been calling you for hours. What's wrong? It's over. What's over? What are you talking about? It's the Declaration. It's not going to be ratified. We were so close. The Russians wouldn't allow the use of the word "God" and I was so worried that the Catholic countries would insist but they didn't. Nobody did, until today. Now it's the Moslems. You've hit rough spots before. You'll get through it. No, not this time. I'm beaten. Now that's ridiculous! You've got chutzpah, remember? This is the only really important thing that I have ever done. I mean that I've done. Eleanor. I wanted to make life better for all those people who can't speak for themselves. Now... You're just worn out. Tomorrow... Tomorrow the lady from Pakistan will pull a thread in the tapestry, and the whole thing will unravel. I can't help them. I can't help any of them. But you have helped them. Not enough, not nearly enough. I was just crossing the Place Alma, all wrapped up in my own disappointment, and I saw this child. It couldn't have been more than four or five, and so dirty I couldn't tell whether it was a girl or a boy. The child sat on a curbstone and ate a potato skin that somebody had thrown out. Just like a little animal. Those are the children I've let down. I've failed them. You're quitting. I know you're entitled to your moment of despair, but your moment is up. You're the one who told me there are only two possibilities. Succeeding or quitting. You said that failure was just a rough spot on the way to success. It's too late, Stella. I thought the vote was tomorrow. Was it today? Did I miss it? I'm told that the Quran is reputed to have the answer to every question, and that you were an expert on it. The Quran indeed has the answers providing the seeker of its truth knows the question. I think I do. Does it matter if God's name is mentioned as long as he is in the room? Only a complex mind can state such a question so simply. I understand the Quran to say "He who can believe shall believe." "He who cannot believe shall disbelieve." The only unforgivable sin is to be a hypocrite. I shall ponder this tonight, and I shall pray. Tomorrow, I will know the way of my conscience. Thank you, Madam Jahan. I leave it God's hands. So you could not sleep either? Oh no, not very well. Would you care to walk? Fine. Oh I might as well give you this now. We may not see each other, later. Ah! Again my thanks. It is unfortunate that we Russians must repay your kindness with harsh practicality. What do you mean? My delegation was up all night. Our decision is that the Declaration is too lofty. Insufficient stress has been laid on social and economic rights. It is all very well to speak of freedom but what good is freedom with an empty stomach? Do you mean the Soviet Union will vote against the Declaration? Please, shall we walk? I take it your silence is to be interpreted as assent? No. My silence is to be interpreted as silence. I haven't seen Madam Jahan, and the voting is about to begin. Eleanor the die is cast. The rumors aren't good. I've just heard that if the Soviets vote against the Declaration the whole Eastern Bloc will follow, South Africa... I don't want to hear any more. The Declaration is right, and it will pass. It's too late for prayer. It's never too late for prayer. I'll see you afterwards. I doubt if she can pull it off, but she's a tough old bird. Lebanon votes in favor of the Declaration. We're almost to Pakistan, but where is Madam Jahan? Luxemburg. Luxemburg votes in favor of the Declaration. Mexico. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Mexico votes in favor of the Declaration. New Zealand. New Zealand votes in favor of the Declaration. Nicaragua. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Nicaragua votes in favor of the Declaration. Netherlands. Netherlands votes in favor of the Declaration. Norway. Norway votes in favor of the Declaration. Peru. Peru votes in favor... Pray for a miracle. Pakistan. Pakistan votes in favor of the Declaration. Thank heavens. So far, so good. Sweden votes in favor of the Declaration. United Kingdom. United Kingdom votes in favor of the Declaration. United States. United States votes in favor of the Declaration. Only one more major problem. Russia. Where's Pavlov? I don't know. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the absence of Dr. Pavlov, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics abstains. Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia abstains. Forty-eight votes for the Declaration. None opposed. Eight abstentions. The Declaration of Human Rights is carried without dissent. The assembly wishes to single out Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt of the United States for her determination and dedication to this Declaration which shall, from this time forward, be a standard for the people of the world. You were splendid. Congratulations my dear. And you were right. Now we all get to go home for Christmas. Mrs. Roosevelt. I must admit I was wrong about you. That was a damn fine piece of work. Thank you Mr. Dulles. Do you think I dare? I think promises to oneself should be kept at all costs. What promise? Hold these for me, Stella. One! Two! Three! In 1982 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights continues to be a viable force in world affairs. To date, no fewer than 64 countries have drawn on the Declaration when drafting their constitutions. My grandmother, Eleanor Roosevelt served as a delegate to the United Nations until 1952 and continued to support and promote the work of the United Nation until her death. She died on November 7, 1962, at the age of 78. Admired by millions as First Lady of the world.
