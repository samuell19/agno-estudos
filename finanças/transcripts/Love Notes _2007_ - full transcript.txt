[music] Nora : And you've just been listening to Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings. And if you love Tchaikovsky as much as I do, please join me tonight as I talk about this most romantic of composers in the opening lecture of this symphony season. Looking forward to seeing you there. This has been Preludes with Nora Flannery on WKRA. [switch clicks off] Reggie : You're off. Nora : And I'm out of here. All right, sweetie. Be good then. All right, see you tomorrow. Hello? No, no. I'm just doing the pre concert talk. I think I can make it. By 8:30? No problem. What? No, I'm excited. It's a good angle... classical music critic goes to a country concert. It'll be fun. And if it gets you to hire me for more reviews, great! Well, that's almost a yes. Okay, thanks for thinking of me. Bye. So Nadezhda von Meck spills her guts to him in long letters, no doubt nurtures untold numbers of fantasies about him, and supports Tchaikovsky by sending him 6000 rubles a year, and yet she insists on having no social interaction with him at all. Why? [click] Well, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all. Nadezhda was his benefactress but she was also a tireless listener with whom Tchaikovsky shared more of himself than anyone. [click] [footsteps] [piano music] Tchaikovsky himself conducted the Pathétique on October 28, 1893, in St. Petersburg. Three days later... [piano music] some say from cholera... [piano music] others say it was suicide... he was dead. [piano music] [music] The Pathétique may be the most melancholy of all the great symphonies. And I believe for Tchaikovsky it captured the sadness of what would never be for him - a full and honest love. [music] So tonight I hope you'll enjoy Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the Pathétique. [applause] [classical music] [rocking country and western] [sings] "Been so long out on the road Put so many miles on this old Prevost You're the best thing I've seen in some time Sweet champagne after months of cheap wine It's been so nice knowin' ya... It's been so nice knowin' ya. You know it hurts to say goodbye But I got a bottle of Jack and my D45 Singing Hank Williams songs as we roll down the road I'm gonna miss you baby But I got to go It's been so nice knowin' ya..." Come on! [music] I love you, Jamie! [music] We love you, Jamie! Hang on for a second, guys. I'm really sorry about that. I've just got to talk to these girls right here. Now, what did I hear you say, ladies? Oh, come on, don't be shy. Did I hear you say you love me? We love you. How do you know I'm the one for you? It doesn't matter! We love you! Come on, ladies, it does matter. [music] [sings] "Don't give your love away-hey." [excited screaming audience] "Just listen to your heart" [excited screaming...] "Find a love that's gonna stay-hey. Don't give your love away-ay. Some folks say that love is like a river The way it flows..." [music fades...] Manager : Come on, boys. Catch some flash bulbs. [excited crowd noise] [camera shutters click] Nora : Mr. Derringer! Jamie : Mister Derringer? Nora : Mr. Derringer, I loved Lonely Star. Did you borrow the structure from Bach's Chacome by any chance? No. [excited crowd voices] Jamie : She's all right to come in, just her. Hey, you, from the Herald, Mr. Derringer would like you to join us. He said to let you, and only you, in. Come on. Crowd voices : What about us? Hey man, thanks for nothing! Manager : Close it up. [background C & W music] [background C & W music] Bach, huh? Yeah. There's a theory. Gets them every time. Look, I was hoping I could ask you some questions. Manager : Hey, it's a done deal! The Japan tour is definitely on. All right! Sushi! Oh, and a lot of it, huh? Hey, look, I'll catch you later, man. I'm going to go upstairs and talk to the merchandizing folks about new receipts. See how we did tonight. All right. Good show, huh? Good show! Ow-ow-ow-eeee... Everyone : Whoooooo....! You know it, man! Yeah, love it, love it. That was interesting. Yeah, Moon Shout Hal. Just be thankful it was a short one. Say, you're not like the usual guy that's hangin' around. Did he get fired? No, it's a cross-cultural sort of thing. I cover this, the pop critic covers Shostakovich. Yeah, I get it... a gimmick. No, I wouldn't say it's a gimmick exactly. I don't read music, incidentally, so there's no way I could have borrowed from that piece you were talking about. Of course not. What I meant was that it was a springboard, a creative inspiration or something. Look, I'm not sure I introduced myself. I'm Nora Flannery, I'm from the Herald. I would really like to interview you. Nora? Flannery. Nora Flannery. Have you got a car? [background music] I'm just so sick of limos and busses and planes and drivers. It sounds like you've got a lot more of that coming up. Asia. You know how big Asia is? It's very big. I'm never going to see the inside of my house again. [beep, beep car lock] That's your car? Shoot, I didn't think you'd have a decent ride. I have to drive. It's my vice. I've got to admit, I like speed. Just being able to get in your own car and drive wherever the hell you want without thousands of people following you... You have no idea. Can you walk a straight line? What are you, a cop? If you can prove to me you're not drunk, you can drive. Lady, believe me, you will know when I'm drunk. [slow measured footsteps] I could do that on the back of a bull. [jingle of keys] Rodeo? Yes, ma'am. [footsteps] Wait, hang on a sec. No, no, no, no. Oh, no, come on. Don't be silly. Mm... scent of suede, it takes me back. Oh, yeah? To what? Your high school boyfriend? Yeah, I've heard it before. What can I say? I guess I'm just a walking cliché. Trust me, it's not a bad thing. That boy was cute. [music] [music] [music] Jamie : Hotel bar's going to be okay with you? It's the quietest place in town. Nora : It's fine. How's that? Okay. Oh, I got that for you. Thank you. Jamie : Howdy. What are you having? Oh, white wine, Pinot Grisio please. I'll have a double JD straight up, thanks. So, I guess we should start. Do you mind if I record this? Wow! I can't believe you're sitting right here! You were awesome tonight! Thank you, I appreciate it. You all have a good night now. Hey, do me a favour. Sign my baby's t-shirt for me, will you? Sign it, or skin, anywhere, just go ahead. I'm really sorry, but I'm off duty for the night. Oh, no way. Oh come on, don't be like that. We paid a lot of money to see you. I hope you had a good time. Have a good night. Look, you're sitting here doing exactly nothing, man. Now don't be a jerk. Sign the shirt. Maybe after we do the interview or something. What? No time for your fans? You know what? You suck big time anyways. The only reason I went is 'cause my cousin gave me the tickets, hot shot. [crash, rattle of glasses] Leave... me... alone. [background music] Congratulations, I guess you got your story. [music] Guy : Did you see that? Someone should call the cops! Girl : Did he hurt you? Did he? Guy : You're lucky I don't sue you. Girl : It's okay. Come on. [music] [elevator ding!] [doors slide open] [distant Hank Williams music] [doors slide closed] [knock, knock] [door squeaks open] [Hank Williams music] Hello. Jamie? [Hank Williams music] [Hank Williams music] Hey. Sorry. I just... I just realized I still had your jacket. [Hank Williams music] Oh, thanks. [music] Listen... I'm not going to write about what happened at the bar. You're not? No, I'm not. I'm interested in your music. Yeah? And I'm interested in you. For an interview, I mean. Um... What happened back there, that wasn't fair. I still feel bad. Well, hey, come on in. Get on in here. You want an interview, I want to give you an interview. Have a seat. Let me get some clothes, all right? Sit. Sit down. [music] What'll you have? Nothing. I'm fine. Oh, come on. You got to have something. I mean I got everything. A professional perk you might say. I'm good. Oh, you got to try this. I mean, this is a nice one. It's a red and it's real dry. Stylish, like you. Thank you. Cheers. [glasses clink] Ahhh... Well, sit down. Hm. You know wine. Well, you could at least try to keep the surprise out of your voice. Sorry. So I guess we should start by talking about your first set tonight. It was, um... What? Um... My tape recorder, I left it in the bar. I'll go get it. That place will be closed by now. I'll take notes then. Whatever blows up your skirt. Is this the way you show me you're not a jerk? I'm sorry. It just happens sometimes when I open my mouth. Hm! Okay, well, here we go. Classical music critic meets a Country bad ass. First question. So you don't know music theory, you don't read a note, and yet you've written some of the most popular country music songs in the past few years. How do you do it? Well... I taught myself guitar. I'd sit in my room for hours on end playing chords. I listened to a lot of music... Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash. You know, the real old story-tellers. Turns out I could just hear it once, and play it right back. That's a real gift. Yeah, or a real curse. Why? Do you think things have to be hard to be worthwhile? Well, what's hard is everything else besides playing guitar. You get into this business to avoid responsibility. Pretty soon it's like every second of every day is scheduled. The music is just an excuse for the business when it's supposed to be the other way around. Hey, what am I whining about? Whenever I want I can pick up a guitar and play this. [classical guitar music] [classical guitar music] The Chacome. You do know it. Yeah, well I heard it once. Here, you play a song. No, I should go. It's getting late. No, I played for you, you gotta play for me. Gotta play our roles. I don't play the guitar. You have no choice. [laughter] Okay. Okay... [hums and strums gently] [hums and strums gently] [hums and strums gently] [hums and strums gently] That was real pretty. That was real nice. Yeah... a couple of lessons in fifth grade. Yeah? You know you got the G7 a little wrong. Oh. That's all right. I'll show you. You ready? Yeah, okay. Lesson One. All right. Got to get your posture right. Which is it? This one? Yeah, you want to get your index finger over the fret like that. Try that. Okay. [discordant strum] What's going on with your finger right there? I don't know. You got to relax it. Okay. Okay. Just relax. [strum] You got to relax your forearm, too. Tuck your shoulder a little forward. Give you a little more length. Like that? [guitar strum] You don't know what relax is. You're not relaxing. [music] [music] [music] I'm not sure this is at all professional. Yeah. [music] Yeah. [music] What does that mean anyway? Professional? [music] [music] [door bangs open] Good morning, love birds! Hey, Jamie, come on, let's go, Let's go buddy, get them up. The bus leaves in ten minutes. Hey! Hey! Up! Are you there? What is going on? Oh, there's my boy. Come on, come on. I'm sorry, darling. He's a notoriously hard sleeper. It's the only way we can get his ass on the bus. Oh, it's you. Well, I am sorry. All the ladies hate it. But truth is, we got a gig in Baltimore tonight and we got to go. Let's go, man, come on. You all right? Yeah. Okay, let's go. I got to go. I had a lovely time. We're late. Come on. "It's been so nice knowing you." Wha-hoo. [slam!] Ahhh...! [laughs] Nora : This is WKRA 97.1 FM where classical music lives. I'm Nora Flannery, your host for Preludes coming to you each day from 6:00 to 11:00 a.m. on your morning drive. Okay? Come on, I could have charged admission for that one. I could have charged admission. I loved it, and, might I add, you are punishing that dress young lady. You've really, uh... You're really filling out. You must have been one major pain in the ass in junior high. Maybe just a little. So, Sylvie from the Paris Quartet called back. She was looking for a phone number for Carl, uh... What's his last name? Tillmans. Tillmans? And she said he's in Milan with the opera. See if someone can track him down because he was supposed to send me his Schoenberg recordings for my lecture on atonal structure. Yeah, remind me to study up for that one. And I'm going to need it soon, so I can put my... God, is it hot in here? Kinda, let's get some air. Come on, I'll spring for the iced lattes. You know you are looking good in that dress. Is it the bra? Padded? Enough about my boobs already, what is the deal? Reggie : Oh, Nora, Nora, your secret's safe with me, I'm not going to tell anybody about that padded bra. I won't tell a soul. Rude, rude man. So how are you feeling after this last invitro? Oh, you'd think out of five one would've took, just one. But no... no such luck. Sorry. Are you going to try again? I want a baby. That's all I think about. Baby, baby, baby. I know. I don't think about my career the way you do anymore. I want to be a mom. I want to be a family. You will be. Yeah. Alrighty, I will have a double espresso, please, and my friend will have... Ugh, that smell. What? Coffee beans? Last week you said you wanted to bottle it and wear it as perfume. I think I'm going to be sick. Oh, oh. Hang on a sec. [swoosh of running water] Are you feeling better? Yeah. I must've eaten something bad. I feel terrible. Oh, you know, if I didn't know better... No, no, no, it can't be. What? Well, I just, uh... Have you ever thought about a pregnancy test? No. I'm just saying... the sensitivity to smell, the nausea, plus the bigger the better. Oh my god. Oh my god, my period. I'm a few days late, but I didn't think that... Holy Hanna. How much longer? Thirty more seconds. [phone rings] Oh, it's just Jeff. You should go. Are you kidding? You'd have to kidnap me to get me out of here. You'd have to send in swat teams. You'd have to beam me out of here, okay? Besides Jeff is chronically early. It's a thing they teach in law school. Nine, eight, seven, uh, uh, uh. Did I ever tell you how controlling you were? How long have you known me? Three, two, one. [music] Ohhh... [music] Positive. Oh, my, oh, my. I'm sorry, so sorry. It just came out. I didn't expect it to happen. [gasping] I'm pregnant. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so selfish. It just came over me. It's just weird. Okay, I'm so sorry, Nora, I am. That's all right. Okay... So, are you going to tell Rene? Rene? No, no... That's been over for almost a year. Wow, the things best friends keep to themselves these days. I'm not obligated to tell you everything that happens in my life. Yes, yes you are. Now's your chance to make it up to me. Remember when I went to see that country group, the Moonshine Dogs? Um-hum. And I interviewed Jamie Derringer? "Country music bad ass," you said in the article. Okay, yeah, okay, you interviewed Jamie Derringer... Oh my god! You slept with Jamie Derringer! You slept with Jamie Derringer? 22 year old Jamie Derringer? Oh, you slept with Jamie Derringer! Oh! He's like on the cover of every gossip magazine everywhere! Oh, you slept with him and you didn't tell me about it? Oh, that is so... that is so... I know. I'm a horrible person. That is so cool. It is? Oh, yes. Yes, it is. Oh, and you know what else? You are going to love being a Mom. A single Mom you mean. No way. No, no, no, no. Don't just dismiss it. No, you can handle this. You're very organized. It's like a sickness with you. I mean a gift. Oh, come on, look at this place. No, I was raised by a single mother. I saw what that was like. I swore that would never be me. Oh, the irony, huh? I go through hell to try and get pregnant and here you are, one pop - boom. I know, I know. I'm so sorry, Claire. No, no, no, no, not your fault. No, I just can't think about it otherwise it'll make me crazy. I mean craizier. So, uh... [phone rings] Will you stop calling. I'm on my way. Will you be okay? I'm fine. You sure? I'm sure. Absolutely sure? Because I don't mind telling Jeff to stuff his client dinner. No, I'm pregnant, I'm not terminal. You should go. Okay, but I want you to call me later. I want to know how you're doing, okay? Okay, I will. Oh, Jamie Derringer! You're totally my hero now, you know, and I want the details very soon. See you. [music] [music] Holy Hanna. Don't you see, I've been thinking about this for hours. It's perfect. It's the perfect solution. Don't joke. Don't do that to me, Nora. I'm not jokiung. I want you and Jeff to have this baby. Really. I have thought of everything. I don't mind carrying the baby for you. In fact I would love to do that for you. To make a baby for you, I would. I don't know what to say. Claire, you have always wanted to be a family. This is your chance. It would be confusing for you. No, it won't. It would be confusing for the kid. No, not if it won't be confusing for me. Come on, Claire. You could finally be a family. We could be a family. We could be a family, Jeff. What are you thinking? What about this Jamie Derringer guy? What if this big star decides that he wants his baby back after all? Nora : Believe me, there is absolutely no chance of that happening. I don't know. Oh, please, honey, think about it. I mean, no more hormone shots. We wouldn't have to take the little bottles to the doctor's office. No more disappointments. And then we'd have a baby that we know would be smart. And cute. And beautiful and smart. Jeff : Okay. But I'd have to insist on a paternity release. We couldn't take the chance without it. But... if it's what you want. It is, it is. And you are absolutely positively sure about this? Yes, are you? Yes, yes! Oh, it's great and I won't have to give birth. You will. [music] This Maler is amazing. [music] You're a little loud. Sorry. [click] You know, I feel fabulous today. Those books are so right. 20 weeks in, I feel great. Great. Except you know what? Can we get these stork vitamins out of here. Uh... hello? Everybody knows. I know, it's just the whole hippo thing I'm not quite ready for. Well, at least they have nice clothes now. Yeah, wanna to go shopping? Yeah. Another one of these came back. Oh, Jamie Derringer? I've contacted his record label, his management company. I spoke to his agent who said he's in China on his way to Japan and then Southeast Asia and god only knows where after that. I've tried everything. You know I don't care about his signature. It's your baby. I know. Jeff doesn't exactly see things that way. Oh, Jeff's a lawyer. Besides, with the hours he's putting in these days, it's impossible for him to act like a normal human being. Now, let's go shopping. Some for me, some for you. [music] Latte. Here you go, non-alcoholic. Where's Claire, the guest of honour? I don't know. I've been calling her. She's not answering her phone. Well, I applaud you, both of you. It really is something. Here's to the unconventional. [glasses clink] [background music] Oh, there she is. Hi. Hey. [sobs] [music] [sniffles] It's Jeff. He's in love with somebody else. His paralegal, um... and he's leaving me. Oh, honey. [music] He wants a divorce, Nora. Oh, god. It's going to be all right. It's not going to happen. We're not going to be a family. [music] [music] [door opens] [music] Oh no, please. Don't get up. Thank you for seeing me so quickly. Not a problem. I think I explained to you my situation on the phone. I need to move very fast. Well, you've come to the right place. Adoptions 'R Us. So, tell me, what are you looking for in the adoptive parents? Just a good family. People who will love this baby. You're making my job easy. If you sign a few papers today and get me the paternity release as soon as possible, I can start setting up some interviews. Paternity release. [sigh] Have we hit our snag? Is it possible to do this without a release? Not if you want to avoid further legal difficulties down the road. Do you know who the father is? Yes, of course. Look there's no judgment here. It was a brief involvement. He's a celebrity, sort of. Well, all the more reason to ensure there's no complications. I guess I'll try calling him again. Listen, Nora, after doing this for more than 20 years, I know you have to see him in person. There's no other way. Well... I hear he's going to be in Atlanta. Maybe I'll take the train since I can't fly anymore. What if I connected you with some couples in that area? Works out quite well, actually. I prefer there be at least three states between the biological mother and the adoptive family. [sigh] I feel like there's about three states between me and the rest of the world. Reggie : All right. [traffic] I got you. Nora : I'm good. I got it. All right, so the car rental office is right by the station. The hotel reservation's been confirmed. And don't forget your package. Oh yeah, I need that. That's the information from my lawyer about the prospective parents I'll be meeting. Hopefully this will help me narrow down my choices. You still trying to get ahold of Claire? Yeah, she's not answering her phone. She's holed up at her parents' house. I just wish she'd call me. Well, I'll try to get hold of her, too. Look, and don't worry. I know you're going to find what you're looking for, okay? I know you will. Thank you. All right, sweetie. Are you good with all this? I'm good. Okay. Don't hook up with anybody on the way. Sh! You shut up. See you later. [music] [music] [excited crowd cheers] Nora : Jamie! Jamie! [music] Jamie. It's Nora. Nora Flannery. I just need you to sign this release. I don't know who you are. Come on, let's go, man! There's a party waiting! Look out! Come on, Atlanta! Wahoo! Look what I got for you. [music] Not tonight, sweetheart. [music] [phone rings] Hi, Claire? No, it's me, Areva. Oh, hi! Did you get that signature? No. I'll get it tomorrow. Your first interview is with the Millers tomorrow in Chattanooga. He's a police officer, she's a homemaker, very stable, good prospects. What about the family in Knoxville, they were my favourites. We'll talk about them when you get those papers signed. I'll get it. I will. I hope so. It's crucial. Have a good evening. Okay, good night. [music] [music] [music] [phone rings...] [music] Claire, it's me again. Look, I know you don't want to talk to anyone right now, but I really wish you'd call me just to let me know how you're doing. I just think we've gotta... You know what? I'm sorry, I gotta go. Claire, call me, please. Call me. Jamie! Jamie! [music] Jamie! [car squeals away] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Jamie! Jamie! [music] [music] [music] Damn. [music] [brakes screech!] [slam!] Are you happy now? What are you? Some kind of stalker? All I want is your damn signature. Why would I sign anything of yours? In case you haven't bothered to notice, I'm pregnant and it's yours. I told you, I don't know you. Oooohhhh! [slam!] [footsteps] [slam!] What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? [car starts] What are you doing? I have an appointment in three hours with a family that wants to adopt this baby. Here, have one of your boys call for another rental. You've got to be kidding! What, so now you're a stalker and a car thief? I'll call your manager when I get to Chattanooga. You can pick your car up there. Listen! Listen! Stop! Stop the car! I'm going to Chattanooga! Wait! Stop! Let me in! [music] All right! Just drop me off at my girlfriend, Lily Jane's place. She'd never steal my car. [opera music] [C & W music] Hey, I was listening to that. [opera] Dead man's dirge. [C & W] It's Madame Butterfly. [opera] My point exactly. [C & W] Please. My man left me again. Bunch of whiners. [click] [music] You know, I don't get your whole attitude. Attitude? What are you talking about attitude? It seems that all you want from a woman is that she's ready and willing. She'll do your laundry maybe. Let you sleep off your drunks, am I right? Are you talking about Lily Jane? She likes my company is all. She likes that you treat her like a maid? You know I bet you didn't even have the decency to call her and ask her if she even wants to see you. Yeah, I bet she really likes that. We don't have that kind of relationship. Well, that's no kind of relationship if you ask me. [music] So why don't you just keep it? I just want to find the baby a good family that's all. All right. By good I suppose you mean rich, big house, fancy college, that whole deal? I just mean good. [music] So why didn't you just, you know, get it taken care of? You know, I don't have to justify my decisions to you or anybody else. All right, all right. Why don't you pull over. I'll drive. You look tired. You shouldn't be driving anyway. You're pregnant. [music] Ohh... my back. Oh, yoo-hoo! You-hoo! You found the place, okay? Oh, you must be Nora. You're so beautiful! Your picture doesn't do you justice. I'm surprised you recognize me at all. Oh, nonsense. And you are? Oh, this is, uh... Joey. He's a friend. Of the father? Yes. No. No. Yeah. Uh... I'm a friend of Nora's but I don't know the father. Oh... What kind of man wouldn't just die to be this baby's daddy? A fool, I'd say. Nora : I'm so happy to meet you both. [music] Hey, Joey, did anyone ever tell you that you look a heck of a lot like that guy on the Moonshine Dogs? Yeah, he gets that all the time, don't you, Joey? Nothing wrong with that. He's a good looking fella. [music] Nora : Thank you so much, This has been so lovely. You are just wonderful. Oh, bye. Oh, bye. Glad to meet you. Take care of our little girl. Bye, now. Safe driving. Bye. All that corn and back pattin'. What the hell was that? If it was something else I'd tell you, Nora. I had to say something. It just came out. Thank you. [music] He said there's a rental car on the other side of town. You can just drop me off there. Can I use your phone now? I really have to call LJ. No, you know the deal. You're acting like a little kid. Yeah, well, I guess we pregnant ladies are hell to deal with. [music] [music] Did you like them? They were very nice. Yeah? I don't see you giving the baby up to 'em. It isn't really your business is it? [car slides on gravel] I guess not, but I just did sit through two hours of stale biscuits and hundred year old jokes. I mean I think I have... Nobody asked you to come, Jamie. No? I did. I'm just saying that I don't think that those people are the right people for this baby, that's all. I mean, there was something about them. It's just like they weren't artistic enough, you know, don't you think? What do you care, one way or the other? Right. I don't care. I don't care what... You can do whatever you want. I don't care. I have to pee. Again? I have to pee. I know, you just went before we left. You ever had 20 pounds sitting on your bladder? It's not comfortable. I really have to pee. Okay. Okay, relax. There's a sign for a diner. Now? I have to go to the bathroom. You can call your girlfriend. [music] Jamie : Hello? Who's this? Derek who? Oh, well I guess congratulations are in order. I just rang her, uh... No, no, I didn't. I'm... I'm an old friend of hers, Jamie. Uh... yeah. Yeah, I'll wait. Hey, baby, how are you? Yeah, I heard. You just got married. I suddenly realized I'm just famished. Waitress : Maybe she's got triplets in there. Starve a fever, but Lord help those who don't feed a pregnant woman. You think she'll save any for me? Looks like you could use another cup of coffee. Lady, you're a mind reader. [music] Thank you. You're welcome. So how far along are you? How long has it been since your concert in Philly? [music] Anyway, it's late, it's way too late to be doing this, but what choice did I have? I'm going to pass on the Millers. I really liked the letter they wrote, but in person, I don't know. All those smiley faces. It's almost like they were hiding something. Exactly. I got three more families that I like. Of them is my favourite. Would you like to see them? Sure. [rustle of papers] Wow, they all took so much care. Yeah, they just put their heart in there. It's touching. [music] Look at this one. [music] Mayzelles. They're Jewish. Yes, they are. Well, that's cool. My grandfather's Jewish. Really? Yeah. [music] This kid's going to be musical, there's no doubt about it. Do you know whether it's a boy or a girl? What do you care? Waitress : Can I get you folks something else? Uh... No, just the check, thanks. Well, that'll be $37.85. Oh, I'll, uh... get you some change. Just keep it. Why, thank you. Well, I guess the next order of business is to find a motel, and a rental car in the morning. Something big so I can squeeze behind the wheel. Yeah. Thank you. You all right? Yeah. I don't understand why they won't meet with me in the meantime. I mean I'll drive down to Knoxville if that's what they want, Areva. This is a legal issue. There are plenty of couples who would be happy to meet you without the paternity release, but the Mayzelles are not one of them. Okay. Well, I'm headed to Kentucky, now. I'll call you tonight. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Rental girl : Okay, will you be taking the insurance? [music] I need you to not have any cars available. Excuse me? I need you to tell him that you don't have any cars for me to rent. But we've got the Fords and the GM. Yes, I know that you have them, but I want you to pretend that you don't. I don't understand. Okay, see him? That's Jamie Derringer. No way. And this is his baby. No way! And I need him to sign a paternity document. And if he puts me in a car and sends me away right now, I'm in big trouble. Don't you worry about a thing, ma'am. [door clatters open] They've got this big old Pontiac with a huge front seat. Should be perfect for you. I'm so sorry but all of our cars have just been reserved. What? What are you talking about? I just got an email from headquarters. The farm equipment convention starts on Friday. And as of this moment all of our vehicles have just been taken out of inventory. Pardon me, miss, I'm sorry, it doesn't make no sense. I just picked it out. The kid's washing it right now. I'm so sorry, sir. Must be some sort of glitch in the computer system. I have an appointment in Kentucky in four hours. How am I supposed to get there? Can I talk to your national office? Because you know a thing like this would never happen in Philadelphia. Nora, Nora! I'm really sorry, miss. What are you doing? How am I going to get there? Who's going to drive me? Come here, would you? Look... I'll drive you. What about Lily Jane? Forget Lily Jane, okay? You shouldn't be driving in this condition anyway. Kentucky is... It's where I'm from. I've got family and friends down there so it shouldn't be a problem, okay? Really? That would be nice. You're from Kentucky? Yeah! I'm from... Nora, do me a favour, okay? Just don't get so upset. It's not good for the baby. All right, you're right. Let's go. Thank you. Yeah. [music] [music] [music] Do you want the radio on? I don't know if we're gonna find classical music out here, but maybe we can find something. It's all right. I'm fine. I got this tune stuck in my head. My grandfather used to sing it to me. Want to try to guess what it is? Okay. [hums a tune] It's nice. You should record it. Yeah, well... you know, Shostakovich, but... No, it's not. It's Rachmaninoff's. No, it isn't. It's Teddy Mossman and Buddy Cate, but nice try. Yeah, but Ted Mossman borrowed it from Rachmaninoff. There's a lot of borrowing going on. A Whiter Shade of Pale? Yeah? Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3. Paul Simon's American Tune? Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings. I could go on and on. You got a PhD in this stuff or something? Or something. I did my thesis on classical music in contemporary culture so it's kind of up my alley. What? What? I was just kidding. I didn't really think you had a PhD in it. That's funny. The thing that I don't get is why do all the country songs have to be about drinking and jail, betrayal and whoring around. That was their reality, Nora. That's what they knew so they sang about it. [music] Nora : Okay, thank you. Bye. So they'll hold the car at the rental place until five. And then I'll be out of your hair. So, in the meantime, I will just leave these here in case you want to go over the fine print. Well, take your time. I'm going to have me a good snooze. Unless you want to come in with me. No. I'll sit right here. Just because you ask good questions and, um... I'm a little worried that I'm not at my most perceptive. All right, I'll come in. I just don't want to get introduced. As what, the father? Guess what, Jamie? You are the father. Hey! Look, Nora, I just don't know what you want from me. [whap!] You know, there are a lot of women who would throw themselves... Nora : Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, Nora. [slam] [whack!] [burble of water fountain] Nora : It was nice meeting you. Goodbye. Thank you. Bye. [footsteps] [music] Get in an accident? She's handicapped. [music] That's too bad. She's a lovely woman. She's very smart. They have a lot of help. He's a CEO. They'd be excellent candidates. Good. Don't give me that attitude. You know, the fact is I'm in no position to be picky without a paternity release. Just drive me to the car rental place. You can... [inhales deeply] Oh, no... Nora, what's going on? I don't know. It feels like, um... maybe it's a contraction. What? I don't know. Oh, man. Is there a hospital around here? You're kidding! Tell me you're kidding, Nora! There isn't a hospital for a hundred miles! Oh, man. Hang on. I know where to take you. [music] [music] Nora : You're taking me to a horse barn? What the hell, Jamie! Oh, god! Oh, there's another one! [music] [music] Wait here. Steve! Steve! You got to get out here right away My friend's in trouble. Jamie, hi. What's happening? Yeah, she's having a baby She's at 36 weeks. 36 weeks? I knew I couldn't get her all the way to county hospital so I came here instead. Okay. Nora, this is Steve. Hi. Are you a doctor? He's a vet. A vet? Jamie, I don't need a vet. I'm also the father of two who delivered them both. Not to mention the almost 500 foals I brought into this world. May I? Sure. There's no distress. Your baby sounds good. Jamie tells me you're at 36 weeks? Yeah. Yeah? Have they lessened since they started? A little, maybe. Okay. You have Braxton Hicks. It's really nothing to worry about. It's just your body getting ready for the big race. But you are going to have to take it easy for the rest of the day. You're sure I'm not in labour? Yeah. After 20 years of doing this, I'm pretty sure. Your baby's heart would be beating a lot faster if you were going into actual labour. But I tell you what. Let's get you inside. We'll hook you up to a monitor and then you'll feel better, all right? Okay, thanks. Woman : Look at you! Hey, man, what's going on? Hey, Gans, what's up? He's a big hero around here. He hasn't shown his face for a long time. You must mean a great deal to him. Oh, no. We're just friends. Well, friend, my wife Maggie is going to bring some lunch by here and then you can be our house guest for the night. No, no, I couldn't. Yeah, you can. We'd love it if you would. Jamie, come on. [music] Go easy now. [music] Steve : Show's over. Back to work. Nora : Maggie, the place is just magnificent. I want to thank you and Steve for taking care of us. Oh, it's our pleasure. It's just great to see Jamie and meet who's in his life. So how do you all know each other? Oh, well, um... Steve's Dad worked for Jamie's father. I mean everybody did around here. Thoroughbreds are our local industry, breeding them, racing them, selling them. All done here at the Keenland Estates. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Jamie is James Keen around these parts. You didn't know? No. So Derringer's a stage name. It's total Nashville, fantasy stuff. And you're saying Jamie's father owns this whole place? He did. He's passed, I'm afraid. But Jamie's brothers run the place now. They're in Dubai as we speak. You know those Arab sheiks are just about our best customers these days. I had no idea Jamie was so... Rich? Yeah, well... It's no bed of roses for him in the big house. Those boys never really took to Jamie. They used to rough him up pretty bad. Why? Well, it's hard to say. Maybe it's because of their mother. The story is, she was donating big bucks to some foster care center, and she just fell in love with him at first sight. I think he was two or three when she brought him home, so she just... Wait. He was adopted? Jamie, Jamie was adopted. Oh, yes, I mean all you have to do is just look at him. The first two are these gigantic red heads and Jamie's dark and skinny, and when his Mom died, Steve's family just kind of took him in. Wow, you know a lot more about him than I do. Yeah, well, I'm kind of the girl next door and it's a pretty small town around here if you know what I mean. [music] [music] Maggie : I couldn't decide which one to marry, but Steve asked me first. Jamie : You did not. Steve : Yeah, I did. I did. You can see how much they've matured. I'm going to ride back with Steve. I'm going to give you two some time on your own. Be sure you bring her back before it gets dark. She needs her rest. Steve : Don't listen to her. [music] I got to admit, I'm a little confused, Jamie, about the whole rodeo riding, hillbilly, don't read music, thing. I mean, you're basically a blueblood. I know, it's show business. Jamie, your being adopted and this whole giving the baby away, I mean... How could you give your baby away? Please don't start that. I mean, really. I can't believe how cavalier you are about it. What are you going to do? Just hand your baby away and never look back? Is that really what you're going to do? Listen to me. I have worked very hard for the life that I have and I'm not giving it up because I... because I made a mistake. But look at you, Jamie. Look at the wonderful life that you were given. Yeah, I know. And I'd give it back in a heartbeat just to know my birth mother. Well, I was raised by a single mother, and she was... she was tired, she was angry, she was... she was stingy, she was resentful. I like my sophisticated grown-up life. It's cost me a lot in every way. Jamie do you honestly think that raising a child with resentment is better than finding a home full of love? Please, I understand why this is so hard, but I need your signature to make things right for this baby. I don't know. I mean I just don't know, Nora. We should get going. [music] [piano music] [applause] All right. That was the best I ever heard! Great job. All right you two, it's bed time. Yeah, time for bed. Ready to go? Yeah. Let's go. I hope it's a girl. Good night, sweetie. Steve : Come on, let's go. Maggie : Now there are pillows and blankets and everything in the cabinet in the spare room. Thank you so much. You have made me feel so welcome. Oh, that's 'cause you are. [knock, knock, knock] Come in. [door squeaks open] [door clunks closed] I thought you might like some tea. I would. Thank you. [silence] Elsie Dobie was the reason I started to play the guitar. I was a pretty messed up kid. When I heard that sound, I just wanted to imitate it. You do remember that night. I do. When you came to the stage door that night in the rain, in my head I was so angry... I mean for months I couldn't get you out of my head. You acted like you didn't know me. I know. It's because I've never been with a woman like you, Nora. You're so smart and beautiful. And I figured for you it was some lapse in judgment we had. No, it wasn't. When you came back, about all you wanted was my autograph, and all I wanted was you. Jamie... I like being Jamie Derringer. He's happy, successful. People worship the ground he walks on. That ain't really me. James Keen was a loser. Yeah, he's got a granddaddy who's rich enough to build a concert hall. And a daddy whose stud horses won derbies, but... in reality he's just a dumb foster kid. Not the kind of man a woman like you would want. Jamie. Why didn't you say something? Nora, tell me we can be together. Tell me I could be this baby's father. [music] [phone rings...] Claire. Hi. No, I'm awake. No, no, I understand. You needed time. Well, things are a bit crazy. Yeah. Well, he actually... He actually proposed last night. Well, at least he says he wants to be a father to the baby. Yeah. Kind of late in the game. I don't know. I mean that's what he says he feels now, but who knows what he'll feel in another day or another week. I don't know. All I know is, I came to get that signature and I'm going to get it. [music] Jamie : So much for thinking things through, huh, Nora? What? I heard you on the phone. I can't believe you, that after everything we've been through all you still want is my damn signature. Why did you spring this all on me now? If you'd have been up front with me from the start, maybe things would have been different. Maybe we would have... [door bangs open] I'm sorry. I'll come back later. Jamie : No, that's all right. I was just leaving. [footsteps] He gets like this sometimes. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I don't know what he's told you. Nothing. I don't know a single thing about what is going on but he's a good man, Nora. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure he is. But, um... Could you just help me call a cab please? Yeah, sure. Sure, I can do that. [music] [music] [music] Janet : That's the red velvet. It's our biggest seller. It's very good. I'm just not hungry. Thank you. Mary : Well, maybe it's a bit rich for your condition. Listen I need to be honest. I'm really sorry, but... I don't have the paternity release. Oh, we don't care. No, no, no, that's okay. You really don't care? No, I mean if the father wants to be part of this baby's life, that is totally okay with us. But, what if he... You know the father right? He's a decent guy? Yeah. Mary : Yeah, well, once he sees how happy the baby is with us, he's not going to want to take it away. We've been wanting a child for a really long time. And clearly we don't live under the same rules as everybody else, so... Mary : So we just be honoured to raise your child and to share that with you. Or the man who brought this baby into our life. Mary : Right. That is really amazing, and I think anybody would be really lucky to have you two as mothers. Thank you. So I think we should... Um... Are you okay? I think my water just broke. Oh...! I'm sorry. We'll go to the hospital. [intermingled excited voices] What do we do? What do we do? Get the keys. Get the keys. They're in the kitchen. This is really embarrassing. [intermingled excited voices] No, no, please don't feel embarrassed. Omigawd... Okay... [intermingled excited voices] [loud C & W music] [loud C & W music] [loud C & W music] Manager : Hey, look, I'm going to have to call you back. Hey, how're you doing, man? I knew you'd come! Come on in. Everybody's here. Hey, everybody! Would you stop. I gotta... Guess who? Hey, aren't you glad to see me? Yeah. Hey, baby, how are you? And, look at this, huh? A bottle of single malt scotch all the way from Inverness, Scotland. You are going to love that. It is smoking. It's smoking? Yeah! Come here, I got something more smoking. Oh, yeah? Hey, Dixie. Hey, come on, let's go. Wake up. Jamie's here. Come on, there you go. Hey, everybody! Woman : Hey, girls, this is Jamie Derringer. Jamie : Hi, boys, how are you? Hi, ladies. And this is my sister, Tiffany. She's been bugging me to meet you. I love you. I have all your CDs. Oh, hey, I wanted to mention... Look, I just got off the phone with Stockholm a couple of hours ago and they met all our demands, right? So, starting next week, we get ready for ten cities in ten days. Huh? What the hell you talking about? You said we had a month off! Hey, well, no rest for the wicked, man, right? Whahoo-hoo! Hey, who's got a tequila for big daddy! You wanna go upstairs? I bet you like to ride bareback. No, I don't. Take that. Manager : Hey, girls, I'm coming in! Yeah! Whahoo! [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Hi. Yeah, it's me. Guess who's having a baby? I think I need you. Can you come? Now? [music] [phone rings] Hola? Jamie : Hello, Nora? I want to speak to Nora. Miss not here, baby coming. Yeah, I'd like to know what hospital you're at. Hospital? St. Vincent. Yeah, uh-huh. Okay, gracias. [music] Nurse : You did a great job. Three pushes, nice and easy. They should all go like that. You feeling okay? I'm fine. Claire... you came. I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call. I'm sorry. I'm just glad I'm here. You okay? They took the baby. They said with possible adoptions it's better than way. Less attachment. Well, I guess I understand that. They almost didn't let me in. Family members only. What did you say? That I was your sister. Come on. [sobs] [footsteps] Excuse me, miss. I'm looking for Nora Flannery. She's in labour. She'll be in Recovery for a few hours. Can I see her? Are you family? No, I've come up from... Then you'll have to be patient. Those ladies over there? They're waiting, too. You can wait with them. [background hospital PA] Janet : I know, I know. She's great. She's a classical music critic from Philadelphia. She's great and she's going to let us have the baby. Can you believe it? Instant mommies. We're excited. What a thought! Yeah, we're happy. [music] [music] Did you see her? Claire : Yeah. [music] Oh, god! I don't know if I can do this. Then don't. Don't do it. You're not a girl, Nora. This isn't going to ruin your life. It isn't a mistake. It's something amazing. Don't you just want to hold that child? Yes. But... But that is all you need to know. [music] Will you... Will you help me? Of course I will. I'm your friend and I'm your sister. [music] All right. All right. I need to talk to Mary and Janet. I need to talk to them right away. I'll go get them. Okay. Excuse me. Could you please bring me... my baby? I'm not so sure that's such a good idea. The social worker's already signing the release forms... Please. I want to see her. I want to see my baby. All right. Oh, I almost forgot. A man dropped this off. He said you'd know what it was about. [music] [music] I'll be sad to see you go, my man. Thank you. I appreciate you saying that. No, everybody... I mean the whole band feels that way. Well, I'm sure the new guy's gonna work out just fine. Oh, yeah, well... Um... Look... What about a solo career? I mean, you got a great voice, you write great lyrics and you got a huge following. I mean if you want, I can make a few phone calls and we could take a few meetings. Thanks. I appreciate you saying that but I'm just going to call it quits for now. Go ahead, break my heart. Break my heart, James. Come here. Come on, give us a hug, eh? Hey, now you stay in touch. I will, take care. Ow, ow, ow, ow ow! Yeah! Love you, man! [footsteps] [sound of approaching car] Mary : It's okay, I got it. Ohhh... Jamie : Here, let me... Mary : Hey, uh... Well, thank you. Jamie : You're welcome. You must be Mary and Janet. Yeah, that's us. I got your names from the hospital. I'm Jamie, the baby's father. Mary : Oh, yeah... Jamie the musician. Yeah, I'm afraid so. Look, I know I signed a release and I really don't have a leg to stand on here but I'd like to see the baby. But we never got the baby. Janet : It was hard for us, but I guess giving birth changed everything for Nora. Anyhow, she changed her mind. Yeah, you didn't know? No, no, I didn't. So you didn't know that she named her Jamie. That's, uh... I'm going to let you two get back to work. Thank you. Sure. Okay. Janet : I know, but I feel sorry for him. Okay, you gotta tell him. Jamie, you know what? I think maybe you should talk to Nora. You hold on. I'll get her address. [music] [C & W music's playing] [baby gurgles] [ding-dong] Oh, no. I've got to get the door, sweetie. [C & W music] Come here. Come here. Get you dry. Got to get the door. [C & W radio music] [door squeaks open] Sorry, we were just having a bath. Well, it sounds like you finally got some taste in music. [C & W music] Hello there, sweetheart. [C & W music] [C & W music]
