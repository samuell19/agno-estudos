Red Eye Double Shot. Aw. - The taste of how much you really care. - Oh, please. I take a three-mile detour to buy a five-dollar cup of coffee to make sure my star DJ is in his chair on time. That's what I care about this morning. Yeah, well, your star DJ has got a car of his own. It's nicer than yours. You blowin' up? Uh, the twins' Christmas list. I got to be out of here by 4:00. You just got here, Aunt Jo. Just letting you know, I have other engagements. Good morning, Josephine. Don't mind him, he's dodging Christmas list demands over there. The twins want tiny horses. These babies will never get tired of stuffed animals. No. These kids are not playing. They want real, hay eating, pooping, miniature horses. Whooooaa. Okay. You could make them lunch. Takes five minutes, shows a whole lot of love. Cash is for me. I make the lunches. Aunt Jo used to pack a bag for me every single day before school. And since Paula passed, she does the same for the kids. I always try to slip something sweet in there. She's worth it. If I didn't share a bathroom with my sisters, and one of them hadn't dropped my phone in the toilet, and if the rice had worked, and if you didn't insist on me learning a lesson about all of that, - I would've texted this list. - Good morning. My "musts" are highlighted in pink. Hold on, Miss Mya. Read the list to me, Rush. Prada bag, Broadway night in NYC. Uh-uh, Mya, we talked about this. Extra is not the goal. It's too early for teachable moments. The richer you get, the greedier those kids get. Grab, grab, grab. Take, take, take. Love you. Mm-mm-mm. Oh, good morning, Jamal. Good morning. Oh, you up for that "early action" day, - ain't that right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh, did you hear yet? No, not yet. But I'm still waiting on the email. You're getting in, you're getting in. And we got the back up schools. - Well, Harvard is the goal, Dad. - Yes. Hush it down, eyes on the prize. - Can I talk to my son? - Yeah, Dad. Oh, my gosh. Listen, you've got this, Jamal. There has only been Harvard. There will only ever be Harvard. - Thanks, Roxy. - That's where it's at. Well, now, you'll have to excuse me. Just got air flowing through these lungs. Now I have to stretch. Got to keep the J-Train on track, you know? - Love it. - All right. That boy's gonna be taller than me in two days. I'm telling you. Where'd he get that wit from, hmm? I don't know. You know, - ...it's got a Rush vibe to it, though. - Mm-hmm. Fame before beauty, get on in. And do not spill that coffee. I just got your last sticky out. - You drive too fast. - Well, you late too much. - Good morning, Rush. Good morning, Roxy. - Morning. We have 95 seconds until air, I still need to do a sound check, go over the Christmas songs list. I gotta get you out as soon as we wrap, you still have Marshall at ten o'clock. And Boris never called me back. It's been three days, I gave that numpty - my candied yams. - Janella, I need you to move the dial down - to, like, a five. Okay? It's early. - Yo! With a face like that, I don't know why you be doing radio, though. Golly. Hey, there's my Adrenaline Rush. Katrina, you need to keep that attitude up all day, you hear me? Those attitudes better stay in their dress, Katrina. Boy, come on. Hey. - You got to let me get my little shine on. - You know what, I need you to focus. I bought you guys coffee, but I got stressed out and drank it. ♪...let it be Christmas everyday... ♪ This is Irv Jackson waking you up. Now, get ready for Rush Williams to get you going. Testing, testing. Yeah, testing me is right. Listen here, Mister Star. - Yes, boss. - Thanksgiving is over. No more turkey. - Yes, boss. - We start playing Christmas music today. Well, let's sleigh away. You like how I did that? "Sleigh." Janella sent you my approved Christmas hits list? - Yes, I did. - Studied, memorized, digitized. - Uh-huh. And so we're gonna stick to that. - Mm-hmm. No hip hop. Live in five, four, three... Good morning, my people. NYC, Queens, Brooklyn, Strong Island. It's your morning shot of Adrenaline Rush on Smile NYC. Floss that turkey out your teeth because Rush Williams is about to put you on a steady diet of tinsel tunes. Whether you're driving to work, driving to the mall, or just letting Christmas drive you crazy. Let's get turnt up with this old school jam dedicated to my firstborn, Jamal. Today's going to be a very special day for him, y'all. "Christmas in Hollis," Run DMC! Oh, here we go! ♪ It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens ♪ ♪ Mom's cookin' chicken And collard greens ♪ ♪ Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese ♪ ♪ And Santa puttin' gifts Under Christmas trees, oh... ♪ Every damn day. ♪ Snow's on the ground, Snow white so bright ♪ - ♪ In the fire place is the yule log ♪ - Stop it. ♪ Beneath the mistletoe As we drink egg nog ♪ ♪ The rhymes that you hear Are the rhymes of Darryl's... ♪ ♪ Jingle, jingle, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ Good morning. Morning, baby. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Gabby, Evie. - Backpacks? - Check! - Homework? - Check! Sugar? Check. All right, make some room. The email has arrived. - From who, you ask? - I usually ask "from whom"? - Why, the one and only Harvard University. - That's right, Harvard. Hold for applause. Jamal. Email? - Yeah. - That's good, right? Ooh, don't know yet. But, I want to wait and open it with Dad. I mean, I'd accept me. One giant step forward for Jamal P. Williams. No matter what that email says, I'm proud of you, baby. Wonder if I can get a prime parking space at Harvard for that new whip with the red bow I bet Santa's dropping off for me Christmas morning, - you know? - Mm-hmm. You're fortunate children, to have all of this. If I was Santa, I'd fly right over this house. When I was coming up, five of us shared one egg. And the only way we got bacon is if the neighbors were cooking it on a windy day. That song gets sadder every time. I mean, one egg? - I know. - I know. Eat your breakfast. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly... ♪ Mmm... - Glaring at me with those business eyes. - Better to remind you that you have got to play the Christmas songs from the approved "hit" list. We need to play this safe, Rush. What happened to "My music, my rules. My music rules"? Not all the time. And this is definitely one of those times. Rush, come on. You want skin in the game, - you gotta play the game. - No. - You know that? - I do. I know. Right? Now the station is in the black, and ratings are up, and ad revenue is solid. We have taken this show to number one. Now we have to make the board see it our way, and then we can be... ...station owners. Wait, I thought you... Well, part station owners, but it's still huge. Focus with me! Do you see it? ♪ Fa la la la la... ♪ - I see it. - Are you sure you see it? I can see it. - Now, we can do this. - We can do this together. - That's right. - Yes. Damn right. So let's close this deal, and then we can start breaking the rules. Counting on it. Looking forward to it. Absolutely. - Yeah. - You know what I'm looking forward to? That big, fat Christmas bonus check. It needs to have like a gang of zeros in it, and a couple commas. 'Cause I done spent like four of them zeros. ♪ There's something about Christmas ♪ ♪ That makes me grin from ear to ear Hm-hmm... ♪ Hey, Daniels! - Miss Williams. - Time for a come-to-Jesus moment. We need Phase One completed by Christmas. That pool needs to be dug before the ground freezes, because you know that thaw won't happen until March, and that puts our Memorial Day timetable in jeopardy. - But, Miss Williams... - If there's OT... - ♪ Ooh, ooh... ♪ - ...my daddy's good for it. You're the boss. ♪ So, baby, come on... ♪ All right. You ready to seal this deal? - Total station domination. - That's it. Yes, I know. It's Christmas. Yes. But everybody's gonna have to take a cut back. Yeah, it's time for me to be Scrooge, I'm not playing. Sorry about that. Hold on. Oh, yeah. Well, it's about to get real "bah-humbug-y" around here, and I'm not playing. I ain't taking no favorites or playing no favorites. Everybody's gon' feel it, and you gonnna feel it too, you hear me? Okay, Ma. All right. Love you, too. Bye. Rush! Roxy! That's us. - Roxy and Rush! - It's still us. - What's up? - All right, Marshall, you know what time it is. It's time to talk ownership. This might be the worst day for that. WMLE just got bought. Walk with me. Bought by who, fam? Hmm. Slow down, fam. Slow down. Hold up. We were for sale? Everything and every thang is for sale, Rush. You ever hear of Camfort Communications? Of course, CamCom. It's a massive network. Satellite. Broadcast. They're sharks, though. Yeah, they are. Hey, girl. I heard she wears her clothes with the tags still in 'em. Well, anyway, WMLE just got chomped on. Like, chomp-chomped. To the bone. And now, we are part of CamCom. Wait. Hold on, give me a minute here, Marshall. 'Cause being a part of that network, it's the big time. Slam dunk. - Hmm. - Like, I'm feeling very LeBron right now, am I readin' this right? Well, it is game time, LeBron. CamCom suits wanna meet you all. All right? - What? - Yo. This could be big for us. Trust me. It's all good. Oh... Right. Hey, what up? - What up? - All right, don't get up. Rush Williams, Roxy Richardson, meet Joss Hawkins, executive vice president, acquisitions and development at CamCom, or what I like to call her, my spanking new boss. Spanky there. - I could get used to that. - I could get used to it, too. Very impressive group. Very impressive. Quiet group. Let's get right to it. I have more people to see. Our plan is to launch a new national morning drive-time show in time for Christmas. National? I like that. You know what? I always thought of myself as national, you know, and I knew that you would see it. I knew you would, and you. I never met none of y'all, but I knew deep down inside, I knew that y'all knew. Oh. What the... what the...? DJ Stacy K. I love her. I like her. She... Why she in my... convertible, though? Wait, we doing a co-host thing, now? Is that... Oh, you gonna add me in later? Rush, Roxy. We appreciate everything you've done here at WMLE, but we are heading in a different direction. But we drove you here. Yes, and now we are taking the wheel. Just like that? After we built up the numbers? After we got the audience reach? - We're done. - Mm... Just so you know, this is not taking the wheel. This is called a carjacking. This is called a carjacking. - Guys. - This is... - Let's talk outside. - Yeah. So, what I'm supposed... - Open the door. - Let's talk outside. That was fun, right? Go get me some water. I am Rush Williams! You don't do that to Rush Williams! Look at me! Look at me. Number one! And here, look! What does that say? Number one! And guess what? Highest rated! Fan favorite! I'm the star man! You don't do this to the star man! And you are huge! In R&B, though. Stacy K is number one in Pop. In New York, and Los Angeles, and soon to be the entire nation! This is out of nowhere, Marshall. Is that it? We're off the air? The devil is a lie! Why would you think that I would possess that kind of energy to do that to you? - Come on! No, you have not. - You know what? - Oh. Thank God. - I got a little emotional. You did. I'm going to give you a grand finale show tomorrow. Oh, come on, man! I got kids, man. - It's Christmas! - And I feel you! Black man on black man. Look... The holidays is coming up, I get that, and it's hard on everybody. I mean, not me. 'Cause I'm cashing in. Big time. You really gonna look us in our eye and say that? You gonna fix your mouth to say that after we met today? You know why we met, Marshall! You see this right here? This is a plan. Know what's in it? - What... - Graphs! Pie charts! A proposal to own part of this station, Marshall! And I understand that, but you... This... These... Are these the numbers? Oh, my God. I'm so mad y'all didn't become part owners before the deal went through. - I mean, look at this. These numbers... - Okay, okay. At least we got our bonuses to look forward to. Got your what? Our bonuses. - WMLE does the bonuses. - Oh! Oh, your bonuses. Oh... Yeah... about that... I don't believe this. How they gon' do this to us? Exactly. This is ridiculous. H-how did she even get the position? I should've seen this coming. Hey, I guarantee you, they gon' regret it. I guarantee you they gon'... they gon' be callin' me back. - Oh, this is painful, Roxy. - I know, but... No, no, this changes too much. This changes too much. When I walk into that booth, and I settle into my chair, and I lean in... I smell the metal of that microphone... and it gets me going. The second that mic is hot, we are live, and that is my moment to connect with my people. And you might think that I'm freestyling, but no, my message is clear, and it is from my heart. Every... single show, I try to nail that. Every single day, for all these years and to just... To just have it yanked away from you like... It just feels like I'm losing a body part. And I... I'm not ready to say goodbye. I'm not. Listen... we've been knocked down before. We just got to find a way to get off the pavement, that's all. What am I going to tell the kids, though? Okay, Christmas is around the corner! Man, those little faces. They just want so much. I mean expect so much. Not so much expect, as demand. They threaten me, even. I tell you, the twins pulled a knife. Hey, this is going to work out. It is. 'Tis the season, right? Just got to have a little faith. Do you really believe that? Isn't that what people are supposed to say during Christmas? Come on. I'll drop you home. Come on. ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ Ooh. Okay, girls. Okay. - Let me help you, Daddy. - Oh, thank you, baby girl. Here you go. That one, there. Don't forget that one. Good looking out. What kind of snack are you making for us? I want pizza. Thanks for... Oh, no. What am I going to do about the pool? No worries, Mya had a "come-to-Jesus" with Daniels. Straight up, she lit a fire under him. But there's going to be something called OT. Really? Lacrosse? - Yes, Daddy. - It builds team work. Yeah, but these things cost a lot of money. Yeah, we're really bad at it, too. Well, you should give it up! Only rich people play lacrosse. - I know. - Right? We're home! Oh, Pops, you're home. I've been waiting. I got the email. - Oh, you got the email. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, you got the email. - Open it! I want to see it! Hey. Oh, my goodness! Gabby, take my phone. We need to memorialize my triumph. Dad, get behind me for the reaction shot. Huh. Yes. All right. I waited to open this together. One for the Jamal Williams future archives. Definitely wanna film both our faces when we find out. Son, will you open the email? You're killing me, just open the email. Okay, I love that you're as excited as I am. - Hey, Jamal. - Yeah. It is okay if you don't get in. Okay? I didn't go away to college, and I don't want you to think of it as a failure. I want you to think of it as carrying on that family tradition, right? - 'Cause that tradition... - I got in! I'm in! - Who's going to Harvard? Me! That's right. - Yeah. - Man, you must be so pumped for me. - Oh, I am, of course, I mean... It's great if you're into that Ivy League-y sort of vibe, you know? - Yay! - You know what you should do? You should check out my Alma Mater. For safety. The Queensborough Community College? Instead of Harvard? - Oh, you are hilarious. - I got you. Oh, man. And look, no worries. I checked and paying a little extra, a freshman can park a car on campus. - There's no car. There's no car. - Yeah, yeah. It's not December 25th yet. Blah-blah-blah. We're taking the Jamal Williams experience to Ivy League! Yay! You're too young to be referring to yourself as a brand. - You know that? - You do it all the time. - Uh-huh. - So... Harvard! Harvard! Harvard! Why did I have to have smart kids? Dumb kids are way cheaper. Why aren't you sharing in that child's joy? 'Cause it's over. It's all over. We are ruined. Ruined! It's a dark day, Aunt Jo. It's dark. It's a dark day. I don't know what happened. I ain't even see it coming. Are you done? For whatever that was? The radio station sold. Job gone. No more radio. It's done. - You've saved. I know you've saved. - How, Aunt Jo? The bills, they get higher every month. We got fresh bills! Jamal had to go to Costa Rica to volunteer to dig wells, so that they could have "clean water." And they all go to private school. Not to mention, it's Christmas. Rashon James Williams! You spoil those kids. They snap their fingers, and you open your wallet. I've been trying to be both parents. Give them everything they wanted because I can't be everything, and yeah, okay, maybe I gave a little too much. You think? That life's about to change. - Straight up. - Oh, yeah. We're about to make some changes around here. Snap the whip. Things about to get tight. They about to get lean. These kids gonna be giving up a whole lot. How do I tell them that? I don't wanna tell them that. Aunt Jo, please. You tell them and bake 'em a pie, okay? I'mma go lay down. This is not a pie situation, son. Remember what your granddaddy said. It's not what you got, it's what you got around you. What about Christmas for the kids? It's going to be all right. Have a little faith. Everybody keeps telling me that. That was the Everly Brothers, "Christmas Eve Can Kill You." Stay tuned for a word from our sponsors. Merry Christmas. Rush out. Forever. Should I call 911? Rush's mental state doesn't seem stable. That's not the note we should have gone out on for your last show. You want fans to follow you wherever you go. Not follow you off a cliff. You got to rise above this nonsense. Be Rush. Be my star. Well, if I'm going down in flames... I'm glad you're the one burning with me. We're poor? - Did I say we were poor? - But you don't have a job. And you pretty much broadcasted that to everyone. Brilliant! - So, no horse? - It's mini-sized. None of that is happening, okay? In fact, there's a whole lot of not happening that's about to start happening. - Wait, is Harvard not happening? - I want it to. - So, what's the plan? - I don't know yet, son. - Great. - Great. Hey, give me some time. - Unbelievable. - So bad. This is worse than bad! Y'all sitting all off in the bleachers like y'all can't hear the conversation? Looks like you have plans for a holly jolly Christmas. Rush, we need to talk. - Did it come through yet? - It's getting close. - Did you tell him yet? - I don't have all the details. You know, I kinda like and dislike the fact that y'all are so close. - Mostly dislike. - Okay. Rush, what if I told you that Krush BQL is for sale? Well, great, more people losing their jobs. No, it closed down a couple months ago. The building is for sale. The station is up for grabs. So, WBQL is for sale. What's for dinner? I figured you'd make it after you finish all your decoration. Hey! Listen to me. We should buy that station. With what, Roxy? My megawatt smile? With money! I built up a pretty hefty 401k. You'd put that up for me? For us. I'm touched, Roxy, for real. But it'd take a much bigger Christmas miracle than that. Is this big enough? Aw. That's sweet, Aunt Jo. But I don't think your little coffee can stash is going to help much. There's $45,000 in there. You wouldn't happen to have more of these stashed under the house, huh? Oh, no, honey, that's my mad money. My investment manager takes care of all the big stuff. Wait, does everyone else have money stashed away but me? 'Cause my money just seems to fly away before I can grab it. - Rush. - Yes? You got your first break at that station, right? Let's get back to where we started. Isn't that what we always dreamed of? That station is way down the dial, Roxy. Yeah, but I miss the time when we ruled the airwaves. We just got kicked off the airwaves last week. We could be a part of the community again, right? Remember block parties, and pop-up concerts? Charity drives? We could sponsor Christmas dinner at First Community Church. - Yeah. - Come on, we used to live for that. And the WMLE suits shut all of that down, and we can bring it all back. Can't you see it? We get to play the music we want. We get to play the music we want. It's like the universe is screaming at us right now. Let's build Krush BQL back up. - We'd be taking a huge risk huge. - Huge, yeah. Risk? Eh... Why don't you let me handle that? Yeah? Is that a yes? Yeah? - Start counting. - Yes! Oh, it's about to be real merry up in here. - Wow. Okay. All right. - Whoo! - Rush and Roxy! - Hey! - That's it. - Oh! All right. Old school. Never mind. Listen, hey, I'm seeing a bright star on our horizon. An opportunity for all of us. My old station, the one that got the Rush engine on the track to begin with, is for sale. And Roxy and I are buying it. Sounds like somebody's spending money we don't have. Will you hear me out? I'm going to need all of you. Even Aunt Jo kicked in a little cash. - And I know that it's Christmas... - Oh. I figured Christmas was already off the table. Not necessarily, but there will be some sacrifices. Now, in order for me to come up with my share of the money to buy the station, - I'm going to need to... - What? - What was that? - I'm sorry, what? I said, I'm going to need to put the house... - Hmm? - You have to speak louder. I'm going to need to sell our house. - Wait, our house? - Oh, snap! I didn't see homeless on the menu. I am always going to provide for you kids, okay? But let's face it. We've gotten a little... What's the word? Bougie. Will you finish eating your pizza, please? Now, stay with me. Just stay with me, here. I want you to think big picture, right? This is a better future for all of us. This is our way out of this mess. Are you ready? We're moving back into our old house. - What old house? - The house that you were raised in, son. - What? - But Auntie Jo lives there now. There are five of us. That is a whole mess of people in that tiny house. There can't possibly be enough space. Listen, as long as we're together, we'll figure it out. One bathroom, six people. I rest my case. You... Mya, you should be lucky we have this option. I can't believe this. I am not going back there. The decision's already been made. And I bet your big picture has me waving goodbye to my future. You think this is easy? I remember you painting daisies all over that mailbox. Trying to make it look all cheery. Like we were getting something other than bills. I wish bills were my only problem right now. Oliver Street. Still holding it down. Ah, man. Oh, Paula, we had it all. This little house. You and me. One bathroom. A leaky roof. Where we got our start. Moving the kids back in, that's... that's going to be tough. They'll be okay. They just need time to adjust. I thought I made it. Thought I'd built them a life. You did. And you gotta keep chasing those big dreams of yours. And not just the station. She's a good woman, Rush. You're ready. I don't know what I'm ready for. Cherish the times that we had, but... turn the page. You've still got a lot of life ahead of you. You remember the time when Jamal was, like, three years old, he opened up all the Christmas presents? He would not take off that sapphire necklace I bought you. Was it you or me who let him wear it to church? Paula, is that you? Are you giving me a sign? You better get off my porch. I got a bat and a bad attitude. Aunt Jo? Oh, baby, it's you! You know, I can see you on my phone. The things they come up with! I'm telling you about this violence. You gotta stop threatening people, Aunt Jo. Seriously. A few weeks before Christmas? Now we gotta leave this house. Not a creature was stirring, not even this angry little mouse.

I didn't say anything. What's that? Your arm fell asleep? You got folded bad, and you need to get out. Ha-ha-ha-ha. I will be living out of that suitcase until you come to your senses. You need to unpack. You need to make this room your own. It's not my room. Are you coming inside? - No. - Okay. But that's where the food is. And the warmth. If you put your little Mya flavor on it, and invited some friends over... Yeah. We'll stop on that one. I'm not bringing anyone... here. Why not? Jamal, your father is doing - everything he can. - To stop me from getting my goals. I've worked hard to be where I am. Dedicated every shred of my life to stay on track, and now that's trash.

This community has been part of your family's life for generations. I was raised in this house. You were raised in this house. Your mother got c... I can't with you right now. Look, you just can't understand. What I understand is that you need to appreciate the life that your father has provided you. But we lost all that! I'm not talking about things. I'm talking about family. Usually the Lord keeps me tuned into a lot, but this is the first time I'm hearing about this. We heard about it this morning. And if you didn't hear your former DJ bought another radio station, well, then, you're a beat behind. This will not affect our Christmas launch. I mean, all due respect, but I'm not sure if there's anything - that we really can do... - Stations need advertising. I mean, we just can't stop advertisers from... We can, and you will, Marshall. We hold the cards in this market. You need to flex some money muscle. Advertisers must not buy any time on that station. Oh, that's hardcore. Listen, the only thing I care about is winning the market. My priority is this station beating any and all competition. Somebody has to win... and that better be me. - Yeah. - We're done. Come on, Tinker Bell. I don't like that dude's suits. You can't do this. You heard the lady. I mean, I have no choice! It's Rush and Roxy. - It's just business, that's what... - You gonna Grinch their Christmas? - Nah, it's just business. - Wow. This is a new low. But it's business. Marshall... You don't understand business. This house ain't so bad. You have food like this on the table. Yeah, I guess it beats outside. Okay, we're done. Yeah. Don't take one more step. Santa's elves are not coming up in here, cleaning up this mess. Gabby, Evie, your plates need to find a new home in the kitchen. Jamal, clear off this table. Mya, you're scrubbing skillets. You're in my house now. I'm scared of you. Good! 'Cause I got eyes everywhere, my children. Back of my head, one on each elbow. You never know. Children were nestled, um... way too snug in their beds, while visions of sugarplums... Are you...? ...better keep dancing in their heads. You know what? You get to have that one. I ain't... Saint Nick, if you don't show up... you ain't got to worry about that clatter, 'cause I'm bringing it to you. I'm not the one. I'm really not the one. You can try me if you want. But I'm not that dude. Rush gon' give it to you. Back where we started... WBQL. Hasn't changed one bit. You say it like it's a good thing. Okay, okay. I spoke to Pastor Abernathy at First Community. We are on for sponsoring the Christmas meal. That feels good. Mm-hmm. And how does that feel? - Squeaky. - Listen. That chair, that squeaky chair, and everything in here, in this fabulous old dump, is all ours. - We're business owners. - Mm-hmm That's got a nice ring to it. That's my Roxy! One, two. Well, staff starts tomorrow, and we got a week to get up and running. It's the Holiday Rush - with Rush Williams on Krush BQL. - Mm. Roxy Richardson. Oh, hey, Chuck. What? We were counting on you. Yeah, but how far back do we go? Yes, we helped you launch that first donut shop. What? Huh. Okay, I understand. It just got cold outside. Marshall and CamCom have threatened our advertisers. Marshall? We can't broadcast without advertisers, Rush. We can't... We can't? It's actually kinda dope that they're seeing us as a threat. We ain't played one song yet, and they're already trying to shut us down. But it's not going to happen. It's not. Roxy. Rush? Do me a favor. Come here. I just want you to step into my office for a second, please. Just have a seat. Now, I know I get a little sidetracked, but check this out. Let's take it one step further. Commercial-free Christmas. Can you see it? You know what? I can see it. And, I mean, we don't have a choice, but we can market it like we do. - Fake it till you make it. - Okay? - Yes. - WBQL... Oh. "Nothing but Christmas." It's like a gift to your listeners, billboards with your face. That's gonna get their chestnuts roasting, ain't it? I... Okay, let me run these numbers, but with the money coming in from your house, we should be able to operate without new revenue for a little while. Until the ratings come in, and the listeners come in, and then advertisers will be running to buy airtime. - Yes. - This is a short-term loss - for long-term gain. - Yes, it is. Yes. This is... You know what I got to do? - What you got to do? - I got to go and start getting these kids into this kinda holiday feeling. I got to... - Okay. - I don't know, man. I want them to feel that Christmas spirit, you know what I mean? Can you feel it? I can feel it. I'm saying, Roxy, can you really feel it? Make you want to, uh! Hey, thank you. All right, I'll call you later. - Okay. - Trying to shut us down. And I'ma whoop Marshall's butt when I see him. I'm thinking, if it was up to me, we would get a little table top tree - like this. - Uh, no! No, I like that one. No, you got to meet me in the middle somewhere. - come on! - That one. - I... - Really? - Wait... - Yeah, of course that one! - No. - Wait a minute. Hold on. - Totally that one. - You're in charge. - Don't let them get in trouble. - All right, keep looking. Principal Peters calls me and tells me that you've been cutting classes. You know, Harvard doesn't like that. You see, it's funny you think Harvard's still happening. What, you don't? Yeah, well, I just figured it's one of the big sacrifices. Jamal, don't give up on yourself, son. Why not? You did. We are extremely poor. You're looking at disadvantaged youth. My father has no money, no prospects, none! - Isn't that Rush Williams? - Was. Now, about this tree... See, you have a little wiggle room? Through these scrawny branches. Oh, whoa. Hey, now, look, I hate to crisp your Kringle, my darling daughter, but we agreed on a smaller tree this year. Sorry. Excuse me. Dad, I got this chump on the hook. I am sure you do, Mya... Listen, buddy, what about that six-footer right over there? - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sure. - Oh, joy! Yeah. Hey, Jamal. It's Christmas, man. This is our thing, it's what we do. We pick out a tree for our house. It's not my house. Don't be like that, man. My house is in Whitestone. With a big tree, and big potential, and a big future. And you made damn sure that's over. You go sit your ass in the car, okay? And I'ma go make some Christmas memories. Whatever. It ain't all got to be merry. - Hey. - Hey. - Whoo, that girl got to be cold. God... - Come on. You know it's cute. Bailey's mom got her this sweet Dolce top for Christmas Mass. Me? I'll be stuck picking through the bins at Bargain Mart for some holiday sparkler. How's that supposed to make me feel? Like you don't have a stupid parent who wasted all that money on a piece of a shirt that makes his preteen daughter look like... - Dad! - What came out of my mouth? You don't want me to be happy. That's not it at all! I'm just saying, hmm? Over my dead body. Dad! This is hard. On December 25th, all my friends are going to blow up on Insta with everybody showing off their swag. Kira is going to Hawaii! Ugh! I can't with her. - Can you just be happy for her? - Without being sad for myself. I know, Dad. That's easy for you to say. Can you give it some time? We have got some joy coming our way. I just need you to believe that. I get what you're saying, but... I'll be honest. I don't have my heart wrapped around this yet. Gotta bounce. My bathroom time slot. I do have hope, and I know you're trying your best. It's gotta be hard. I mean, we're not exactly low-maintenance. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Can you say that again, please? We're not low-maintenance. Oh, my God, my heart can't take how much I love you right now. Come here. - Promise me something. - Mm? That Santa will bring me at least one Insta-worthy moment. Hmm... Go, before you miss your time slot. Possible hoarder situation here. This woman needs to purge. - What is she doing with a Thigh Master? - I don't know. Don't you touch my precious things. How can she even hear us? - You better stop messing with her stuff. - I'm... Paula. Oh. I forgot about this. Just left it when we moved away. Well, we gotta take it downstairs. Hang up the ornaments on the tree. Ha! - Look at Aunt Jo. - Mm-hmm. - Who he look like? - Oh, right. Yo! She packed these away. Oh, I wish I had sweet memories like that. You know, I remember this one Christmas. I was seven, and it was the year my folks divorced, and they couldn't afford separate houses. So they drew a line and split the house. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mom upstairs, Daddy downstairs. It was like a war zone in there. And then, on Christmas Eve, um, Daddy had the house, and we were celebrating, and he snuck into my mom's room to get his Santa costume out the back of her closet, and my brother got so freaked out that he was trespassing that he called Mom and she called the cops. And there was Daddy, tiptoeing in in his Santa costume to the front of the house, and the cops tackled him before he got to the front door. Yeah. Oh, Roxy. My sweet, sweet Roxy. I mean, I'm okay, you know what I mean? I'm okay. You know what? You well-adjusted. You really well-adjusted.

Christmas tradition. That thing stays outside for three days. The only reason that tradition started is because you and your mother couldn't figure out who was going to bring the tree in. Well, thank the Lord you have these ornaments. I... I expected a little more Christmas going on in here. I like a simple Christmas. All I need is my Nativity, and my lights on the tree, my baby Jesus, and a star to light the way. And it's gonna be a little bigger this year, for my babies. Mm. Well, they're lucky to have you, Josephine. I keep telling them that. I love her. All right. I'm headed out. I will see you at dinner. - I am looking forward to that dinner. - Mm-hmm, 7:00 p.m., okay? Enjoy your memories. All right. - Bye. - Be careful. - Shh! Is it turned on? - See if I can get it louder.

Two adorable twinkles. - Perfect. - Ah, she was always beautiful. She was the most beautiful mommy ever. She loved y'all so much. - How long you gonna keep this up, huh? - Marshall, your insecurity is not my problem. Okay, so, yes. Yes, you're still in the doghouse, but I need your help right now. - Okay. - Boris says he wants to "jingle my bells"? Hmm. - Do I want that done? - Well, what does your spirit tell you? It could be... - Update me. - Oh! Good news! Well, for us, anyway. Check it out. We got the situation on lock, all advertisers have complied. There is not a snowball's chance in hell that any of them will be buying time on Rush's station. I'm only concerned with our launch, and this will do. This will do very nicely. Yes. So, I couldn't get a "good job", or... "Marshall, you so blessed and highly favored", or none of that? - If that's what you need, good job. - Thank you. Man! What the hell?! Oh, crap! The situation just got unlocked. Handle it, or I'll... Or I'm done, I get it. Welcome to Santa's naughty list. I'm just doing what's on her heart right now. You know what? No, no, no.

Oh, go. Go. - I'll call you from the car. - Okay. I think I'm having heart palpitations. Yeah, I understand. It's gonna be all right. Jamal, where are you? I texted all his friends. Even my contacts in his class. No one's seen him. Hey, everybody. - Josephine, we hear anything? - Baby, not a word. And it's Aunt Jo from now on. I'm going to pop a 'gram about bedazzling his Jordans. That should get Jamal texting me back, - or running home to kick my... - Mya... please! I can't think. I know. Let's go sit down. Come on. Come on. Listen. We will find him, okay? And you know he loves you. - He's just hurting. - No, this is on me. I've been way too selfish, going after this dream.

Well, I'm never mad at a little old school. Mister, you need to cool it down. We're looking for my brother, Jamal. I haven't seen him. But, I wouldn't know it if I did. But, I'll keep an eye out for him, if you like. He looks like this, except angrier. Think you can look for him better, now? All right, we want to thank you for your help and we hope you have - a very merry Christmas. - You be sure to tell Josephine that Reginald Miller said "merry Christmas." And she can always call me if she needs help getting her lights put up. If you "know her" know her, all Aunt Jo needs is her star on a tree, and her baby Jesus. All right, let's go. Merry Christmas.

Don't you think I know that, Jimmy? Je... Merry Christmas! Merry... Merry Christmas to you too! - Has he ever done this before? - No. Jamal's never done anything like this. - At the old house, maybe? - Maybe. Oh, here. Let me help you. I can... Thanks. I am so late for work. Okay. Aw. Look, how cute. You're so good with her. You have a little one? Oh, me? No. No, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought she was one of yours. - Oh, no.
