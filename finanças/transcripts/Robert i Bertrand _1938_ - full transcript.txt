4 copies of "Robert and Bertrand" exist in the National Cinematheque. First one is a pre-war copy gifted by PWSF from Łódź. Second and third ones are dupe-negatives of lost copies. Forth one comes from the USA. The version showing so far was based on third copy. Between 2010-2014 all copies were scanned and conserved, and put together to create a complete version. In reference to the previous copy, movie has been upgraded by 15 minutes. Now it lasts 53:44, yet it is still not complete. The reconstructed cover comes from American distribution of the movie. The song "Robert and Bertrand" recorded in 1938 by Dancing Orchestra "Syrena-Record" under Henryk Wars' baton, was used in the movie. Works were completed under the project: "Conservation and digitalization... of pre-war feature films from the National Cinematheque" Project was financed by the UE.

"Weekly Romance" announces the great competition for the best criminal novel. Who will win our competition? Huge prices and huge fame. Where are the [slang word]... - Black Mańka responded: [It's some slang of thieves] [She continues using the slang] Such ugly words in mouth of yours, milady. Jan doesn't understand it. It's larcenous jargon. That's how thieves talk. "[slang]" means a boy. "[slang]" means they ran away. And "[slang]" means prison. You see, Janek, I have to study this larcenous jargon so that my novel will resemble life. But let us go further, Jan should listen: (Meanwhile, banker's corpse was lying in the office) Milady, please, I really can't listen right now. - His Lordship calls for young lady. - I have no time for the daddy now. One moment, where did we stop? (Meanwhile, banker's corpse was lying in the office) Jan should listen, what a peculiar criminal mystery this is. Everything must be explained. Let us assume that Jan is the banker's corpse. Who killed Jan? No one knows. At least for now. Because the room was closed. And in the other room... One moment. We will make a plan. Here is our mansion "Witowo". This road here leads to Kosciklapki. Here is the office. Dates are also important. Let's assume, it is Thursday. Here [slang word] (break-in) should take place. So a theft. And here is Jan. Jan should lie down. Jan is banker's corpse. Jan should lie down. - But... - But milady. - Silence. A corpse doesn't speak. Corpse only listens. Suddenly a vicious bandit creeps into the room. He stands in the doors. His eyes so wild and crazy. He opens his arms and shouts: Irena! No papa! He shouts: scandal! Irena! What does it mean, Jan? It's not Jan. It's banker's corpse. And papa is a burglar who was about to come with the pick. Irena! Irena! I am fed up with all this. Jan! Get up, immediately! Jan doesn't hear someone arriving? Faster! Move! Go, now! What is this. Papa destroys everything. I don't want any of this. You understand me? You won't make a bandit out of me. Shame. Dishonor. An adult, marriageable lady. And what would Count Dobkiewicz think. I've had enough of your writing. Enough of your larcenous talk. - Papa knows nothing about literature. - And I don't want to. Irena! It must come to an end. It must come to an end. Otherwise I'll [slang] (scold) you, I'll make you such [slang (break-in)]. Even I got infected by that pest. Hello my friend. I'm sorry. I pay my respect. You come from Warsaw, Sir? I brought something for the Chinese collection. Well, I am really thankful. - Porcelain, right? - Indeed. Wonderful. 14th century. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - For what? For this surprise. What surprise? - Well, this vase, this vase. - Ah yes, really, that's it. I've already forgotten that I've managed to remember. My memory fails me sometimes. Don't you worry. Don't you worry. Distraction is a sign of a great intelligence. It's wonderful, wonderful. - What's that? - To remember this beautiful sentence. Don't make me cry, sir. Jan! Jan, please announce to the lady that he's come. His Lordship is calling. Count Dobkiewicz has arrived. I have no time. Jan! Please, tell me. Has Jan ever been to the prison? Me? God forbids. Never. - It's a shame. - I don't regret it. Unfortunately, Jan isn't thuggish at all. I hope so. Maybe Jan knows someone who has been in the prison? I must speak to someone. I need it for my novel. Isn't there any prison around here? There is only an arrest. - Excuse me. - No. - I have some ties to sell. - I see. - So I'd like for you, Sir... - Well? Very nice, they'd suit your face. Or rather my collar. [word play here] Ah, yes, of course. Your collar. Please, take a look. I am really sorry. Don't be sorry. But them so beautiful, just take a look. Stripped ones. Dotted. - With flowers as well? - With flowers as well. - Spotty? - Spotty as well. - With circles? - With circles as well. - With teeth? - With teeth... - I'm sorry. - Don't worry, I'm not angry. You idiot dealing with men's wardrobe. You'll wander around the world selling no ties at all. That's how you sell. Only the best ties, in cash and in installments. [sound is cut; in this segment rhymes are used] Only ties, in cash and in installments. Silky, neat and slender. Good product from a cow. Once tied and it's worn in day and night. [cut sound] Once tied, one won't want to take it off. Holiday or Friday, maybe for an Easter to wash a pig. Silky, slick, cheap and wonderful. [incomprehensible] Please, please, take it. That's how you sell. Not like... Excuse me, name's Pomorski, excuse me, excuse me. No. Bravo, bravo. I'm amazed. Now I see, I am not gifted when it comes to selling. You are professional, Sir, [cut sound]. Educated professional. Professional. And I can't sell a stupid tie. - I studied, graduated. - That's your mistake. Were you not to graduate, you'd know how to sell. And you sold a lot today, sir? Same as you, sir. - You see, sir. - Shabby area... who would buy a tie here? Well, then... Sir, sir, please, come here. Is it that bad? You have an appetite for a dinner and dinner has none for appetite? Don't be nervous, my friend. Sit down, sir. We'll think of something. - Maybe a partnership? - You, sir, with me? Me with you, you with me. - Well, would I know? - Come on, Robert. - Bertrand. - Private limited company. Don't be nervous, sir, so you'd know, that richness doesn't bring any happiness, only cash. Well, smile a bit, sir! Well, I make gonna teach you a trick, trick of face-fighting. - But why? - It's just a joke. Hit your knees, sir. One. And two - hands. - Well, just like children... - But wait a moment, sir. It looks as if we're fighting whilst we don't. One, you hit me in the face. And then I clap. One, you clap and I hit you. And now faster. One - you hit me. One, two. One, two. It looks as if we're fighting. Every man is very grumpy, when he is very lonely. When he has no one to worry with and no one to laugh with. Then he searches and he chooses a colleague, a partner. And if he's sad or if he's jolly he shares everything with him. Together up and down. Everything, my brother, fifty-fifty. We make a partnership today, Robert and Bertrand. Two heads share one thought, Robert and Bertrand. Will the fate be good or bad, Robert and Bertrand. I for you and you for me, Robert and Bertrand. Either frost or May, give me your hand my friend. Either laugh or cry where you go then here go I. With or against the current, my friend, Robert and Bertrand. They create the common front, Robert and Bertrand. Money is no real fun, they'll steal or take it away. Money flows and disappears even if you had full pockets. It is really something different, [cut sound] Friendship like this is a model. [cut sound], Robert and Bertrand. Robert and Bertrand. Robert and Bertrand. Look here, they're fighting! I used to be. I used to be a steward in a real, big prison. Those were the times. Around 50 people. I was conducting and they were singing. [cut sound] To leave your homelands. That was the choir. Those were the thieves, miss. Those kids know nothing about music. Well, nice wedding you got here! What? Can't you talk, sir? Then play for us at least. Hi, hey, hello! All the best to you, health, happiness and a long life! - What do you want here? - We've got beautiful ties, cheap, silky and slender. - We've got a wedding today! - Then let us go, hey! - Then maybe some tie? - No need for that. Out, you scoundrels! Don't you worry, my friend. You will eat soon. Let's go. Here they come! Here they come! So that the kids grow strong, tall and wonderful! All the best! [he uses Polish Gorals's dialect] We come from bride's family. Give me a kiss. - And who are you? - We come from groom's family. Money for the bride! God bless you. [cut sound] Newlyweds alone now. Now new hands! They stole the money. Two got inside here. [cut sound] [cut sound] - What are those noises? - Yes, I asked for 3 rooms. What is this? None proper thief would stay here. Sir, you must take care of the business. Well, well, well. - Here we had some notable thieves. - Yes? You guarantee they liked it? [cut sound], nice head of this idiot. And me? All alone, I am all alone. - That's the thief's life. - It's interesting. But very hard. You shouldn't bother with this craft. You, miss, so young. Why are you looking like that at me? - Are you afraid, miss? - No, why would I? I'll call for steward to put me into a different cell. He doesn't hear you. - Or he left. - And what would happen now? We'll wait for him. And in the meantime, I am gonna tell you a story. One you would like. About a thief. About a big, peculiar thief. A thief in love. This thief in love he stole the sky from stars. He robbed the sun, [cut sound] to steal her heart. He couldn't cope alone. He couldn't cope alone. Because a friend was an idiot. To steal a lady's heart. You must be an idiot. [cut sound]. Who thinks any different, will be alone like me. Pardon, [cut sound]. And lady of heart. It's worse to steal than to love. A weak becomes out of the hard. And stupid. As they said. He is a thief, he stole the sunshine rays. And he wasn't afraid of anything. And he boldly wandered around. And he heard of curse called love. And he had to fall over. Because he wanted to steal away a heart. [cut sound], it's a fact. - You sing very nicely. - Really? We will make a choir. Coffee, tea and all of this. - Now, dear gentlemen, we have... - What? - ...[cut sound] this choir. - All right. Attention, please. Three, four. Goral, aren't you sad? To leave your homelands. Those spruce forests.... - She ran away. - What? She ran away. I'll show her... Excuse me, gentleman. You'll excuse me, gentlemen. I will leave you alone for a while. This is what a paragraph says. Excuse me, please. [cut sound] Well, she had such a beautiful... Well what, I've seen through the hole, a typical beauty of a thief. [cut sound], my dear. It's a pity. Listen. She lost some paper. - Wait, it's here. - Where? Give me your hand for a while. Wait a moment because I can't... Wait, it's not here. And not here either. - He speaks now... - O, here it is. - Look, she lost this. - Read it. - I don't understand it. - Wait, [larcenous slang] (break-in). - Yes, it's what she's been saying. [he repeats larcenous jargon] (break-in). - [Some slang word] - No? [larcenous word] means breaking in with a theft. - It's impossible. - How come, look. Thursday, everything matches, it's today. - So what? - She had a job today and she is gone. It's impossible. Listen, we have to get out of here. Sit down, it's bad here? Listen, we have to get out of here. I won't let her steal things. I don't want her to steal things. Romance based on [cut sound] - Just a random thief. - [cut sound], I say. - Are you my partner? - Of course. Then you must help me. Enough for today. To the cell, now. How, only now I can speak. Goral, are you not sorry? - Silence. - What? - I have no time today. I have to look for her. - Go, to your cell. - Then let us go. - What to do? - Go to sleep. Sleep, sleep. Listen, I need to get out of here. Calm down. Listen, I will tear off the crates, I will demolish the whole cell. Stop it, my colleague. You'll see, they'll throw us off here. What an idiot, what, is it bad? It won't get better. He wants to escape... I haven't lost my mind yet. You, calm down! What is going on here? - Here he comes, run. - I don't care, I haven't lost my mind. Thieves! The ran away! I'll teach you! I'll show you! I'll teach you! Bandits, thieves! They want to play blind man's buff with me. Bandits, thieves! You thieves! You wanna play blind man's buff with me? Hold them! Hold the thief! Catch them! Yes, we'll have to. [cut sound] Wait for me and I'll... [cut sound] to the office, to get the ticket. 32 trip-tickets to Warsaw. - Here you go. - Thank you. Please. 32 trip-tickets. To the train, to the train. Well, you'll be late. Train will soon [cut sound] Now, to the train. [cut sound] Well, everyone's here? Praise be to the Lord. Mr. Professor, can I leave? - Chinese? [mocking his look] - Why are you laughing? Wait, wait, wait. - She gave him [cut sound]. - So what? What? She opiates on the trains. He's asleep. It's very good. Look. Her partner. Don't be nervous, my friend. First we need to check with the old one. I need to get back to the compartment. Wait for me in restaurant car, sir, - I will be down there in a minute. - Of course. Can you smell it? Smoke. And something else? Nothing. Exactly, this nothing, it's [cut sound] So that no one would see it through. What do you wish to find here, gentlemen? Us? We wish ourselves all the best. - We interrupted, right? - Please, go away. So that you, Miss, could stay alone, with this sleeping prince? We have a business to him as well. Sit down, Robert. We'll talk. Silence, or he will wake up. Come, out of here, come out. [cut sound] to steal. Jealousy of the competition? Maybe you would prefer to take it by yourself? I would. Do you like it, sir? I do. So you can take one cigarette from it. - Please. - Thank you. A cigarette, not the case. There you go. And the cigarette case... will remain with me. I wouldn't be so sure. Please. For a loser, not for an idiot. [sound is too cut to make it understandable] Now you have something different [cut sound] And it's time to think about some holidays. - What for? - What for? To ponder whether is it enough [cut sound] - Tickets, please. - There you go. And your tickets, gentlemen? We have our tickets in the other compartment. ...other compartment. - Then I'll go with you, gentlemen. - Please. - Please. Now a cigarette. Where is my case? - Where is miss Irena? - Well, she has left. - With whom? - With you, sir. - Where? - To the restaurant car. - Who? - Well, but Irena... - Miss Irena. - What is Papa looking for? - For my case, I must have put... Wait wait, I have it with me, don't look for it, Papa. - He stole. - What are you saying? The case has been stolen. Sir! Where are those two that you've just restrained? They ran away from me. They jumped off the train. They didn't have their tickets. I didn't expect that from him. One moment. A man has just come to Warsaw and he has no peace. It's a deaf aunt. She missed Jan. Man got some rest from her in the village. One moment! Please, miss Marysia, finish this. - I hear her Ladyship. - Finally. [cut sound] he came for breakfast? His Lordship sits with his porcelain. What? He cleans his rooms? [word play on rhyming words in this segment] I am not asking for Jan but for his Lordship. Well, Jan must be losing his hearing. His Lordship is with his porcelain. Yes, exactly, for the breakfast. Jan has finally heard. Jan should go see the doctor. It's not good to not hear anything. Oh, it's a real pity. Everything so dusted. Everything so neglected. While I'm gone, your auntie wouldn't even move her finger. She's afraid to destroy her lacing. Irena, my dear, pass me the vase that is standing there, in a corner. I need to clean by myself. Give it, give it, my beloved daughter. Irena, why are you so sad? Such a sad face. My child, is this the stolen cigarette case? Yes. I was let down. I thought there are decent people among thieves as well. No, it happens only in novels. Especially in yours. But in a real life, thieves tend to steal. I won't be writing this novel. I lost the fervor for it. And for the thieves as well. Bravo, bravo Irena, finally you've come to your senses. - Let me kiss you. - My dear respects. - Let me... Dear Count! - I'm so happy. - And me as well. Dear Count, I am so happy... I have to hug you. Dear Count. Surprise for miss Irena. Ticket to the theater for today. - I hope you won't refuse the Count. - With a great pleasure. ...your cigarette case in my pocket... - It's very interesting. - Your coat was hanging next to Papa's? [cut sound] I changed my mind, Count. I not going to the theater. I go back to my novel. [sound is too cut] Don't be angry, my dear Papa. Won't you be proud of your daughter, a famous criminal novelist? No! I won't be! I won't be! Wait Papa, I'll teach you. One. Two. Two. Three. Four. Two. Two.

[cut sound] When I do this, then Jan does that; When I do this then... Inversely! When I do this then Jan does... Once again. When I do this then Jan does that and I... And it doesn't work. How did she show me to do it? Ah, dear Count. Dear Count! Dear Count! I have an amazing trick, a really amazing trick. I am gonna teach you now, just wait a bit... Dear Count. You do that and Jan does that. And when Jan does this, you'll do that. And then straight to the face. Yes, try it, please. Well, good. Two. Well, one. One. Two And to the face. Pardon. Does it hurt?

What are you doing here? We came for a [larcenous jargon] [break-in with theft] Same as you, miss. Here, there you go. - Your plan was ready, right? - My plan. - So you are judging... - We don't judge... We're not a court, to the best of your luck. Ha, what a laugh! And you've come to be my competition, right? Thieves don't do this. It's dishonest. - We run away! - On foot? - What should we wait for? - We have a car. Miss, are you crazy? You want to steal a car? You'll be put into jail again. I'll manage somehow, don't worry. - So, do you hop in? - Then let's go! Here you are safe. You can now walk freely. And you, miss? Miss wants to get rid of us and sell this car. And even if, then what? Well, a car isn't a jewelry. You won't put it into a pocket. Don't be afraid. It will be what will be. I've sold many stolen machines before. To Bald Jakub? He buys all the illegal stuff? - This, where? - Please my friend, don't make fun of us. Bald Jakub. Zielona 6. As if you didn't know this sleazy place. Yes, naturally. All the bunch gathers there so you must be joining them too. Of course, I'm coming. Right, but you won't steal this car. - Ah yes, you want to steal it? - No. No one would be stealing. We go back and put the car back to the garage. - Yes, but... - Enough with "buts", now, go.

Is this your friend? - One moment, Robert, let me handle this. - There you go. Can I ask you, my friend, for a couple of words there? Follow me. - I am scared for him. - Don't be nervous, my friend. Well, what do you want, loser? I really wanted to ask you, sir, in advance, were you to be so kind... [cut sound makes it incomprehensible] Leave it be! The dance was very nice. I've never had so much fun. You are very [cut sound] [cut sound] Jan won't let in? Jan can go sleep. - Goodnight. - All right. I go to sleep.

Well, Mandarin sends his dearest greetings. From Mandarin Wu-Wu. Mandarin Wu-Wu. - Yes. My dearest friend. Mandarin here wants to underline that he is a feeble worm. That he is not worthy of kissing your feet. Why do you make a worm out of me? Ordering me to kiss his foots? Shut your gob. Gob? Well, Mandarin speaks Polish?

Unfortunately, she couldn't tie her life with a life of a thief. Irena! You're writing again? The guests are waiting. I will only finish this chapter, Papa.
