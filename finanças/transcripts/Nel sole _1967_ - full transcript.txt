I hope that there is Someone in this world Who one day will tell me Why we are alone in the middle of so many people Why do we want what we don't have? I only have things that are worth nothing But they are the most important At my age I am looking for some love among people But people won't understand you They won't understand you They won't understand you And when I will cry My first Tears There will be only the wind To dry them Friends with cardboard faces And the girl who is right for me The day I will have Nothing more than a button You'll see them without their mask Without their mask Without their mask There will only be the wind To dry them I only have things that are worth nothing But they are the most important At my age I look for some love among people I know that people won't understand me I know that people won't understand me They won't understand me The works of Antonio Canova are divided into three groups. The mythological group, the portrait group and the funeral monuments group. Horns! I'm superstitious. Canova, lucky him, was enthusiastic about classical beauty and life. If, instead of being a sculptor, he had been a professor, he wouldn't have been so enthusiastic. He'd have had a bitter life every month, with a miserable salary like that of every public employee. Besides that, he'd have fought every day with 30 shrewd and lying devils like you who pretend to listen to the lessons but think about their own affairs. Right? Anyway, if someone wants to kindly close the curtains, I'll show you the main works of mythological and portrait groups. Since Canova was enthusiastic about beauty, obviously there are many nude figures. Boys, I want to be clear, one comment and I'll leave the mythological group and go on to the group of funeral monuments. Again with the horns. This marble group, representing Cupid and Psyche, was defined as "the most beautiful Arcadian idyll of the 18th century." I should add that it expresses all the sensuality of the century, but I won't add it, because it can be seen. There. Now… The Three Graces. How graceful! Since you are so good, tell me how many versions of it exist. Let's see if this is dumb proof. You, Alessandroni? No pun intended. Pun intended, actually. I understand. Of this marble group there exists… There exists… Six, seven, two hundred? - Two hundred versions. - That is not so. Works of art aren't done on the conveyer belt like your father's washing machines. Let's hear Carrera. Two versions exist. They are preserved in Woburn Abbey in England and at the Leningrad Hermitage. - You made a mistake. - Excuse me, but I must insist. The answer is exact, but you made a mistake in sitting down. Your place isn't among the students, but at the teacher's desk. - You are very kind. - You almost know more than I do. I don't understand you billionaires. Now you even have the hobby of being good in school. In going on to the portrait group, I think it is right to look at Canova's real masterpiece. Paolina Borghese. - I knew it! - Madam, excuse me. I would like… I would like… Speak. Are you perturbed? It is said the Paolina Borghese only offered her face and that Canova took the rest from the Venus Victrix. That is what they say, but I think Paolina offered her body and soul because, besides being Napoleon's sister and princess, she was a shameful woman! So… - In this work… - Carlo! When is the lesson ending? In ten minutes. Thank heavens! Can someone tell me what it deals with? Answer one at a time, or else I'll get confused. Let's hear the usual Carrera. It's "Venus of the Bath", preserved in Palazzo Pitti. As opposed to the Medici Venus, realism predominates over the pure inebriation of the Greek form. You scare me. You speak about it as if you were talking about cycling or soccer. I have studied history of art for 20 years. You began as a little girl. Very funny! I've taught for 15 years, published an essay and two monographs, but it is the first time that I've heard such a precise expression. "The pure inebriation of the Greek form." - Carrera, you are a monster. - How lovely! - Who is it? - Giacomo! I wanted to tell you something, but I forgot. You'll remember now. Finished! Goodbye, kids. I'll see you on Monday. A good Sunday to all of you. The Physics professor invited me to lunch. He is very finicky. Where is the funny guy? There is nothing between the Physics professor and me. Not yet! Of course, I very much hope so. I forgot my purse. Goodbye, kids. Have a good Sunday. - What will we do on Saturday night? - We'll be together? Sure, if your girlfriend or boyfriend aren't far away. It's difficult. Today everyone goes by car and fast. To meet a girl you have to hit her car! And she'll insult you! - They're waiting for me at home. - You eat together? Old fashioned. - That's what we do. - The nobles have a motto. Lorena's is "Eat with your family and drink with someone else." - My father's is better. - Is he noble? No, a state employee. "Eat when you can and drink when it's offered." - Let's decide about tonight. - Let's go to the Piper. - No, there are too many kids. - And it's out of style. Belle de Jour, an 18-rated film? - It should be a 50-rated film. - You went to see it! I've been told about it. Let's go to a sinful nightclub. I can't. My father's an employee. He gives me 5,000 Lire a week. I have to pay for everything with it. No nightclub. Carlo, instead of dreaming, speak. Say something. - I'm fine with anything. - Then we'll go to your house. - It's about time! - Great idea! Just fine. Sorry, we're renovating. There are painters and interior decorators. Plumbers, iron and steel workers. - Why renovate if you're never there? - We never find you on the phone. - I don't call you anymore. - Where do you go? It's his business. I work with my father and Uncle Ernando. Ernando, three coffees. Ole'! - You earn lots of money with coffee! - I must go. See you at my place? Yes, alright. Lorena, may I accompany you with my new convertible? - No, thanks, I'm going with Carlo. - His car hasn't arrived yet. - It will. - Here it is! Where are you going? We haven't agreed on the cars yet. - Alright, I'll pick you up at 6:00. - Will you come with me? - Every Saturday the same story. - Yes. Lots of plans, lots of ideas, and we always end up dancing at home. What matters is seeing each other. I was hoping to see you last night at the theater opening. Unfortunately, with my work… Do you speak with Rio de Janeiro every night? Yes, and the calls arrive at impossible hours. Luckily, I see you at school. Otherwise… They always answer on the phone. "Good morning, Miss Lorena. Mr. Carlo went out." "When he returns, he will call you. Don't doubt it, Miss Lorena." When I can, I call. I wish school lasted 24 hours a day to always have you close to me. School is ending soon. Good! So we'll have more time for ourselves. - What if we drift apart? - Never! Get your head off my shoulder and stop. This is it. Watch out! - Apologize. - Why? They should thank me. You have no tact. - See you tonight. - Yes, tonight. If I wasn't who I am, would you love me anyway? - In what sense? - If I were poor. Try becoming poor and you'll find out. Bye. If I were you, Mr. Carlo, I'd try to become poor. Yes, but what if after that… Wait until you are in a hole in the ground, then! Like I just said! - I'll straighten up. - No. You must study and become important. That is why we've decided to help you. And to take you under our high protection. - Mine is high, yours is low. - This is something serious! We wanted to be your Pyg and Malion. - "Pygmalion" is one word. - As he says. You are our pupil and things were going marvelously. - We gave you a roof, a bed. - A desk. The lady went, returned, left, and left again, and she never noticed anything. Now you've almost got your diploma… And you are in love with a noble and rich girl. And you have gotten an inferiority complex. So, to please you and help you study, we helped you become an Italo-Brazilian billionaire. We got your clothes, a Rolls-Royce, a driver, a butler. Did you know that love is the tomb of marriage? That the tomb is the marriage of love? That love is the tomb of the tomb… Look who is here. How are you? Have you finished? - Love is life. - Sentence. That was my sentence. - Life sentence! - Love is a life sentence? - I've finished. - Are you happy? - Why? - You disheartened him. Me? You started it. I did general preaching. You stuck the scalpel in the injury. Ciccio, what are you talking about? What is a "scalpin"? You shouldn't have talked about love. It's true. You're right. Sorry, Carlo, if I disheartened you. Hearten yourself up. Love is a wonderful thing. You are right. I made a mistake because of my stupid pride. I'll tell Lorena everything, even if I can't go to school anymore. No. You must not tell Lorena and you must go to school. You'll tell her later, when you become an architect, a doctor, or a municipal employee. You can't take away the satisfaction of having been your Pygmalion. Thanks, but I don't deserve what you do for me. You deserve it! To avoid revealing ourselves in public, let's keep a distance even in private. Do you have anything to order, sir? May we withdraw? Thank you. You can go. Ciccio, he knows how to be a billionaire better than a real one. - Let's go. - Just a moment. What suit do you want to wear this evening? I'll take care of the suit because I am the butler. Do you want a particular breakfast? I'll take care of the breakfast. Enough! You want to boycott my role as… - Pygmalion! - Yes. I carry out my duties like a soldier. Assignments must be shared. What do you know about being a soldier? You were rejected because you're too tall. Come on, please… Don't argue like always. - You're right. - I won't argue anymore. But I'll take action. I'll prepare a suit for this evening. Don't worry, I won't let him. He would have you go out dressed like Harlequin. Chauffeur, do you know the difference between butler and driver? Yes. A driver goes in a car, a butler goes on foot. - You want some? - Yes, Lorena. Some Coca-Cola. - You want some? - No, thank you. You don't drink, you don't dance. There are only couples here. Find me a free woman. Here she is. Your ray of sunlight is coming. Francesco, will you dance with me? - Sure. Hurray for America! - What's that mean? The women take the initiative. You don't seem very happy about dancing with me. - You're wrong. - Don't lie. I know you don't like me. Without glasses and a different hairstyle, you would be cute. Especially if another girl was in your dress! You hillbilly! Did you ever look at yourself in the mirror? Every morning. I find myself masculine and virile. Women like ugly men. What is Carlo doing? Neglecting you? Why? Do you want to take care of me? - I am here. - Good. Stay where you are. Carlo called me. He may not be able to come this evening. He'll come. He's probably waiting for the usual call from Rio de Janeiro. Hi, Lorena. Excuse me for being late. I was waiting for a call from Rio de Janeiro which just arrived. - We knew it. - It's an old story. You are too important, Carlo. You told me that last Saturday. Last Saturday you were waiting for a call. You are so monotonous! Shall we dance? Giorgio is still in love with you. For five years now. We were in eighth grade and he was wearing short pants. At times, I understand him. - And I even feel a bit guilty. - Why? Because I think of how I'd feel if I lost you. And it's only been six months. You won't lose me. I won't leave you. Stop dancing. - No, I just arrived. - Late. - As punishment, you'll sing. - Punishment for him or us? - For you, maybe! - He's right. Let's put on a record. - Carlo! - Don't make us beg you. - Come on! - Come on! One day You wake up and find out That the world is in your hand You are someone now It's enough for you To raise a finger and then You have everything you want Everything is easy Dreams have come true But I wouldn't want All the gold in the world In exchange for you Who stay there waiting For me To remember you What is all the gold in the world Compared to you You who love me? Me For a billionaire, he knows how to do too many things. Forgive me If I left you here Crying for me I was flying high, you know I was far away from you But I wouldn't want All the gold in the world In exchange for you Who stay there Waiting For me to remember you What is all the gold in the world Compared to you You who love me? Me Bravo! Bravo! - You could sing on television. - Another one! Mom, can you tell Caterina to bring us something to drink? Yes, but don't forget that it's past midnight. That's right! Let's hurry or the shop will be closed. - Where are you going now? - To the sea to eat a pizza. - We'd already planned it. - My husband's playing poker tonight. Alright. Goodbye, good evening. Drive slowly. - Dear, don't be late. - Don't worry. Be careful, Carrera. The battle is over. - For me, it's just starting. - I'll help you. No, thank you, madam. Youngsters today are all crazy. They always have the best excuse. They are young. - Will you make 20 pizzas? - The oven is off. - We came here specifically. - The cook left. - We are hungry. - Make some sandwiches. - How many? - 20 with cheese and 20 with ham. - I want "lonza". - And lots of wine! - Let's eat on the beach. - In the moonlight. - Let's go drink! - Right! Guys, I'll join you right away with the orchestra. - It's cold. - It's freezing! Let's turn on the heaters. Let's go collect wood. - Yes, come on! - Wood! Wood! There are streams without water And the sky at times has no blue There are beaches without sun And those who no longer have love But I have you I have you If the world should fall I have you There is no doubt That I will never stay Without you It's sad to have to live just for living And talk to who never listens It's sad to have lots of people around And feel more lonely than ever But I have you I have you If the world should fall I have you There is no doubt That I will never stay Without you But I have you I have you If the world should fall I have you Whether I'll be important or not What do I care? Because I have you If the world should fall I have you There is no doubt That I will never stay Without you He's a pleasant guy. You'll see. You are right on time. - This is my son, Giorgio. - My pleasure. - What will you drink? - Martini. - Me too. - Three dry Martinis. Next year you will handle supplies with him, because when he finishes studying, he will become vice president of my company. Very good! Congratulations! I agree, because young people see a lot farther than we do. To the future vice president. Cheers. As you know, my washing machines fear no competition on the foreign market. This year they ordered twice as many as last year from Berlin. Your washing machines fear no competition in the American market. This year they ordered twice as many as last year from Canada. Giorgio! Giorgio! What are you doing there? I am talking to you, Giorgio! - Come here. - Yes, Dad, I'm coming. Once that absolute void is created, you'll see that piece of wood in the bell jar lose specific weight and weight of gravitation. Astronauts stroll in space and he's playing with bell jars. Now the small wooden object will begin to float in the void. Your attention. Your attention… Well? What is happening? Careless. What happened? Despite the absolute void, the piece of wood settled on the bottom of the bell jar. Darn! Darn! That's never happened before. What happened? Darn! - Professor… - What do you want? The object doesn't float anymore because… Go on, say it. I was expecting that one of you would intervene. Come on, tell me the cause that hinders the object from floating in the absolute void. Let's hear it. Come here. The object doesn't move because an absolute void wasn't created. By adhering to the bottom of the bell jar, the piece of wood created an interspace of air. While the pumps were sucking in, the bell jar should've been moved to move the wood and prevent its adherence to the surface. You think I should have shaken the rotors? Yes. Young man, you should know that there are rotors to do this. No. Unfortunately, they've been faulty since the start of the year. A note was presented in the secretary's office, but… That's true! That's very true! Bravo! My compliments. You are an attentive student, intelligent and astute. Thick-headed people should take example from the astute person I will repeat the exercise with. Can you be so kind to move the bell jar? I won't tell you anything because you know what to do. The pumps work perfectly. We are creating an absolute void. Absolute! The object begins to float. To float. You see? It isn't moving yet, but it will. It's a matter of seconds. It has to move! There. It's moving! It's moving! It's moving! It's moving! Nothing is moving here! Carrera! Will you explain why nothing is moving? Yes. - The pump didn't suck in. - Did that break too? No, but your foot is on the tube. It's awesome! Nothing escapes you. Not even the foot on the tube. Young man, there are too many of us here. So, either you leave or I will. Recreation! Alright, then we'll both leave! Goodbye. A good day to everyone. - Are you sure it was him? - I could bet on it. - You could or you will? - I was with my dad. I was far away. But the waiter was surely Carlo. How do you explain the Rolls-Royce, the clothes, the villa? That's it! The villa will give us confirmation. Carlo, have the architects and workers finished their job? - Where? - At your villa. - Yes, they've finished. - So we'll come to your home tonight. OK. Everyone at my house tonight. May I send out an official invitation? - Unless something comes up. - Don't look for excuses. Finally we'll see a real villa! - With waiters and a butler. - Are there greyhounds in the park? And Pekingese dogs in the living room. Let's tell the others. Come on. I am very happy. I can't wait. Why? Are you so interested in my villa? It's not about the villa. I want to see where you live, where you study, where you think of me. Give me a token. Hello? Hi, Ciccio. It's me. Tonight my friends are coming to the villa. I didn't invite them. They invited themselves. Why isn't it possible? The lady left and is returning on Monday. I can't make up another excuse. Ciccio, please, listen to me. The villa exists. Yes, but it's not all clear. He tried to postpone the party. I don't understand how it's possible. You forgot that look-alikes exist. - It's my turn. - Help! - I knew it! - A nice game, huh? The game is nice but she's ugly! It's your turn, Giulio. - It's my turn. - It's more on my side. Aren't your glasses good enough? Maybe I should use binoculars. You're right. - Go. - With your permission, I'd like to substitute that bottle. It has a broken neck. Then give us another bottle. I am the other bottle. I assure you that my neck aims well. - You'll have a lot of fun. - Catch, boy. Attention! The neck aims, the neck wins, the neck kisses. Here I am. Does the gentleman want to protest against my head? - Shall we dance? - Yes. Excuse me. - Good evening. - Welcome back. Good to see you. What is this waste of electricity? - It's a long circuit. - Short circuit! It's short when the electricity goes off. When everything is turned on, it's long. Did the long circuit turn on the radio? It's the neighbors' radio. - What neighbors? We are isolated. - It's the radio of faraway people. There is a rough sea and very big waves are arriving. Enough! What is going on in my villa? What is going on in her villa? The moment of truth has come. - An orphan, poor and alone. - Who? - A friend of ours. - A sort of… - He is very much in love. - With his classmate. - She's rich and from high society. - He pretended to be a billionaire. - Where could he invite his friends? - To my villa! See? You feel the same way we do. You shouldn't have dared without my permission. We couldn't tell you. - You shouldn't have asked me! - In fact! This is too much. You are fired! I'll take care of the billionaire! - No, please. - Don't ruin the boy. - Don't humiliate him. - He couldn't go back to school. - Who is singing? - Our friend. - It's him. - He has a beautiful voice. He is singing. Me too I exist too In this world made up of people… - Ciccio! Madam has… - Madam! People who have a mountain of money In their hands And don't realize that The world of the poor Was wanted by God The world of the poor Was wanted by God And while I live It will always be like this It will be The same life Because God wanted it God wanted it God wanted it You're not introducing your sister to your friends? My sister. Hello, kids. Consider me one of you. I'll steal my brother for this dance. We haven't seen each other for a while and have a lot to talk about. - Attilia, will you dance? - Who? Me? Excuse me, madam, I am very humiliated. Don't worry. It's something different for me. I like acting this role. I'll explain everything tomorrow. Don't worry. What is your name? - Carlo. - I am Ivana. - She isn't Carlo's sister. - Who is she? - I don't know, but it's strange. - You're ruthless because of Lorena. What is it? I am now sure that Carlo is a waiter. - You insist? - After what we saw? - It's not possible. - I'll prove it tomorrow evening. Who is she? Her? She is cute. My compliments! Kids, I'm going. I drove 2,000 kilometers. I am very tired. You go on. No, thanks, we're leaving. That is, I'm staying. - Goodbye. - Good night. I'll accompany you. Come. - Are you glad? - Happy. Your sister is very nice. I'm already fond of her. One day I'll leave this villa. Why? It's so beautiful! I will like living here. - And give up "two hearts and a hut"? - We'll have more room. - Come on. - You'll sweet talk tomorrow. - Come on. - Bye. Come here. You were leaving without saying goodbye? I'm sorry. I'd have done so tomorrow morning. - You'll laugh about me. - No. I behaved like an idiot. A poor idiot. Now I must find the courage to tell Lorena the truth. Why? When you aim high and want to reach something, all means are legitimate. I have suffered too. Like you. And I arrived where I wanted. You must defend your position. Whatever the price may be. You are so young. You need to be helped. If you want to stay with me, there is a guest room. No! I can't accept. Think about it. I am alone here. - Goodbye. - Good night. - So I was wrong. - It was the present participle. - He told me to do that. - I thought it was right. - Why did you do it? - It's not a serious mistake. See you. I assure you it's relaxing. Lorena, come. You came to save me. They wanted to take me to a museum! - I need to tell you something. - What? I… Dad is here. You'll tell me tomorrow. - Sure. I'll tell you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye, Carrera. - Good morning, Mr. Vivaldi. Well? The evidence that you promised? I'll show you tonight, and it will be sensational. We'll see. Good morning, sir. Your sister needed the Rolls-Royce. The Jaguar is being repaired and the Seicento got sick. So we'll walk with the dog, in search of trees. The farce is over. Tomorrow I'll tell Lorena everything. Bravo! Besides your studies, you're also maturing in life. What is it? Hold still! Don't move! Stop! Stop! That isn't a tree, it's a gentleman. Please, could you move? My dog mistook you for a tree. - What? - Move! Move! My dog mixed you up with a tree. What do you want? I don't know you. There will be consequences… Look! Do you see? Now you'll get rheumatism. Do you realize what you did? - Now you're moving? Not before? - Go away! Why am I to blame if you didn't move? - Take your dog elsewhere. - The dog did right. The dog did right. You are a tree! A solitary tree. Not bad! - I reserved that table for you. - Thank you. - This is our table. - Not bad! - I am sitting near Franco. - I was sure of that! - Let me sit there. - Sit next to me. - Lorena, come close. - Where are you going? Are we all here? Why have you brought us to this specific place? - You don't like it? - I think it's a bit cold. You think? It's an unpredictable place. It always has some sort of surprise. Did you tell Carlo? I tried calling him but I couldn't get hold of him. I took care of that. He'll be here soon. Here's Carlo! How is it possible? Did you see? You knew! You brought us here to humiliate him. You should thank me. I did it to make your love more romantic. You descend from Prince Vivaldi. "The princess and the waiter." Take me home, please. Let's leave. It's fun, huh? Do you feel ill? Sergio, take care of table four and five. - Alright. - You can go home. Thank you. - Did they all leave? - Can't you see? And Lorena? Carlo, Lorena is a sensitive girl. She couldn't stand the idea of being served by you. She preferred to leave. But you stayed. I like that you serve me. - Waiter! A steak, rare, and a salad. - Yes, sir. Please… a match. My fork fell. - I'll get you another one right away. - No. Pick this one up. Excuse us. Help me get him up. Are you hurt? I am here at night And still think of you And, to me, it seems that You're close to me I am here at night Without asking myself why I am thinking of my life That is so much tied to you I am a man like those Who don't know how to forget And therefore I still hope That you'll come back To me I am here at night And still think of you And, to me, it seems that You're close to me Close to me - I've had… - A disappointment? We women aim high, my boy. We are always ready to share the riches of the man we love. Never his poverty. - Did you tell her? - She saw me working as a waiter. So now you no longer have a girlfriend or a job. I can find a job. And love. Come. I'll show you the guest room. Nobody was ever able to deny to Tintoretto the title of head of a school. Right, Miss Vivaldi? Excuse me, I was distracted. You're looking at empty desks? I could understand if at that desk there was a handsome boy! I… Look at me. I may not be handsome, but I'm not an empty desk. I was saying, most of his works… Are we at it again? Alessandroni, please, fill up that place. That's it. Good thing you're sort of ugly. Miss Lorena Vivaldi won't look over there anymore. - Many thanks. - Excuse me. May I go out a minute? A moment of relaxation? Sure, go. I'll come outside too. Kids, I'm going out for a moment. Try to make a bearable commotion, please. Thank you. What is going on, girl? Nothing. You're shedding tears for nothing? Maybe I understand. You were looking at Carrera's seat. Is he sick? The sky has gotten cloudy, but it will clear up after the rain. Let's take our time and smoke a cigarette. Anyway, they don't give a darn about history of art. You want one? You don't smoke? Good girl. Good for you. Besides, there's only one. Go, Diorissimo! Go! Go, Diorissimo! Go! There. He's third now. Go, Diorissimo! Go! Go! We won! My horse won. Vivaldi, you're distracted and listless. If you don't want to follow the gym lesson, you can go. - You want a ride? - Not from you, thanks. - Good morning, Miss Vivaldi. - Good morning, Professor. - Good morning, colleague. - Waiting for the bus? - You want a ride? - Thank you. It's a pleasure. Let's go. Bye, beautiful. - You have a vehicle too. - I do what I can! I should get a car too. - Maybe a Vespa is better. - Sure! Get on, Professor. - Where? - Behind me. On the seat! - Get on. - I'm getting on. - Get on! - Two teachers on a Vespa… It's normal. Students ride in cars and teachers ride on Vespas. - "C'est la vie", the French say. - Hold on to me. - I will. - Hold on tightly. - I am holding tightly. - Ready? I am ready. Oh, Saint Nicholas! - Slowly. I don't have a helmet. - Hold on tightly. You're zig-zagging! Where are you going? Hello? Good morning, Miss Lorena. - Is Carlo there? - No. Carlo has never been here. You found out… Yes, I know everything. I wanted to know how he is. I thought he was sick. Why should he be sick? He didn't come back to school? He left. Yes, sure, he'll come back. He'll come back to school too. You're welcome, Miss. Excuse us. What happened is our fault too. Sir, may we? - What do you want? - Miss Lorena called. - I don't care. - She asked about you. -I don't care. She wanted to know why you haven't been to school. And we care about that. - No, it's my business! - One moment. Let's have a man-to-man talk. No, a man-to-bad-boy talk. You can't answer us like that. We've always loved you like a son. We went along with the act to please you and help you study. And when you came in here, we thought, "Good. It'll help him forget. This will pass too." But you must go to school and get a diploma. - Then you can do what you want. - I already do what I want! Alright, but don't count on our help anymore. Go on! If you want, you can have us fired. It's crazy! - Why did you have me stop? - Carlo went by, Dad. Wait. - Wasn't it Carlo? - No, I made a mistake. - Vivaldi Lorena. - Ten. - Seven. - In Latin, six. - In Greek, six. - In History, six. - Four. - Four? Yes. One, two, three and four. She had seven in the first quarter. Mr. Principal, I'm sorry, but in these last few days, Vivaldi's work has gone down terribly. The girl is in a crisis. What can I do? Physics is a subject that doesn't allow ups and downs. Professor, raise, raise! - What should I raise? - Her grade. I can't, I'm sorry. - Raise it to six. - At the most I can reach five. - Six! - Well, five or six? - Six. - Professor? - Didn't you hear her? - Physics, six. - Seven. - Are we starting again? No. It's my grade. - History of Art, seven. - She's approachable. - Chemistry, six. - Seven. Absences, none. Excuse me. Before we leave, shouldn't we discuss the Carrera case? - Shall we evaluate him or not? - No. - We'd create a precedent. - He's been absent for almost a month. The boy could be ill. He's not ill, Reverend. I saw him the other evening, in a nightclub, dancing. Do you go dancing in nightclubs? No. I don't go dancing in nightclubs. Some friends who came from Bari took me. It's better to come on a scooter! I don't see the connection. Nothing… It's an inside reference. I would like to examine this case in the afternoon, more calmly. What is it? Did I say something wrong? - What you said is not nice. - What? That Physics can't stand Vivaldi's ups and downs. - It's the truth. - But the girl is in love! In love? With whom? You men have love in front of you and don't even notice. Vivaldi is in love with me? Aside from Physics, you don't understand a thing! How could a girl fall in love with you? She loves Carrera. A woman like myself could fall in love with you. So, you don't think I am a man to be thrown away? To be thrown away? No, Professor. You are to be picked up! Miss Vallone, I seem to understand that… - Come on. - There… You don't dislike me. It took you long enough to understand! - You know what? - What? - If this is how things stand… - What? - You and I… - What? - Could… - Hurry! Or I'll remain a spinster! This is my hand. I give it to you and say yes. - Thank you! - Be discreet, Filippo. You don't want to do the ups and downs of Physics here! Be discreet. Filippo… - He is the Physics professor. - Thank you. Excuse us, Professor, if we dare bother you in the street. With your lovely wife. - I am not his wife. - That's what I thought! What are you insinuating? One doesn't walk hand in hand with his wife. - You two have something going. - How dare you? Excuse him, my friend was only kidding. Who gave him the right? He doesn't even know us! You're right. I'll introduce myself. Franco Sparapaoli. - Sparapaoli… - You kiss her hand? - Are you jealous? - No, he isn't. No, but don't kiss my friend's hand. She's your girlfriend! - Listen, Sparapaoli… - Franco, to my friends. - Let's forget it. - I won't forget it. - She won't. - I want to clarify that. She must clarify. I am not "his" friend, which is specific. But I am "a" friend, which generalizes. - Understand? - Yes. My compliments, Professor! At your age you have more than one girlfriend! What are you insinuating? My age? More than one? You want to disgrace me? Don't worry, your wife will never know. I am not married. I am a bachelor. So much the better! Without family complications, you can have fun with all the girlfriends you want. Sparapaoli, I forbid you to continue! Calm down. My friend doesn't know what he's saying. We're not here to investigate your private life. The lady here could even be a respectable person. What does that mean? What does "could even be" mean? She may not be what she looks like. - What does she look like? - No, Filippo. He must tell me. Go on, tell me what I look like. I don't know… I just said it… No. Now you must say it. - I swear I don't know. - What do I look like? - What does she look like to you? - To me… A pro… A professor. - In fact, I am. - She is. For me you're an angel come down from heaven. Professors, help us. Carlo Carrera is like a son to us. He's lost his head, but soon he'll come around. I know. I know everything. We know. Unfortunately, that boy risks not being evaluated. - You must "valuate" him. - Evaluate! As he says. I don't know how to talk. I've always spoken badly. But you understood me. Today young people make mistakes. We who are no longer young must reach out a hand and pull them up. Not to give them a push. - Anyway, thanks and I'm sorry. - Please. It's the first time that he's spoken well. And we'll do the impossible for Carrera. - Right, Filippo? - We'll promise you. Now that we know one other, may I ask an indiscreet question? - If it's not too indiscreet. - He had better not, then. - Forget I said it. - Ask. - Ask. - The truth. Is there something going on between you two? - There is. - There is. - She's a bachelor, he's a spinster. - It's the opposite. Alright, but what are you waiting for to get married? - We'll do so soon. - Very soon! - Cheers for the newlyweds! - Thank you. - Have a good day. - Goodbye. - They're pleasant! - Very pleasant! Professor! - The hand! - What do you want? - The hand… - Let's take care of the papers now. - What papers? - The wedding publications, my dear. Hello? Hello? Dear! Where are you? Where are you calling from? You're arriving Sunday? I'm glad. I can't wait to embrace you. I was beginning to feel alone and abandoned. Sure, love, I'll come to the airport. Yes, yes… See you soon. - Want to go to Cortina? - Of course! - Anywhere in the world with you. - Without me. - I can't. - Why? - He is coming. - Who? The clothes you are wearing must belong to someone, huh? - What? You have… - What did you think? That I was a heiress? Come on. You'll be able to return in eight days. I'm not leaving or coming back. I am not going! Don't shout! You want everyone to know about us? Everyone knows very well, even if I sleep in the guest room. - And they despise me. - Enough! - When he comes, I'll tell him. - Are you crazy? You want to ruin me? You want to take me with you on the streets? I don't care about the money. I want you. I don't want to give you up. Did you ring, madam? Where did that imbecile go? He's in the kitchen, helping the cook make pasta. - Carlo makes pasta? - No, Ciccio. You said "imbecile"… - Carlo went out. - Good! When he returns, have him get his things and disappear. - I see. It's all over. - Nothing ever began! - Understand? - Yes. Never anything. He dared to threaten me. I welcomed him into my home and I helped him. - He was like a brother to me. - Of course! You have such a big heart! There's room for everyone. Where is there room for everyone? In the villa. You keep on doing charity. - The engineer is coming Sunday. - I knew it. How? From the phone call. I passed it to you right away. Get the car ready. I'm going out right now. And be discreet if you want to remain in my service. Don't worry. Ciccio and I are like monkeys in mystery stories. We are blind, deaf and mute. I fear you talk too much. Maybe it was just a fling But it left a mark inside of me Your love only lasted One hour And for this reason I'm crying I'm crying for you I still see you white from the moon Running in the wind, close to me But in your green eyes There is no fortune For who looks for a future close to you It will be useless to wait for you Because I know that you won't come In your eyes there will be Another moon and another love I know it I know it It will be useless to wait for you Because I know that you won't come In your eyes there will be Another moon and another love I know it I know it All I have left is a fling The only memory I have of you Your love only lasted one hour That is why I am crying I'm crying for you - Good morning. - Is the madman back? - Yes. - But he didn't take his things away. - What is he waiting for? - For the engineer to return. - He says he wants to talk to him. - He is really crazy! - I hope he does nothing foolish. - I wish! No! We care for him. It's your fault if I'm in trouble. You brought him home. We brought him here, but you brought him inside. Like a son. That should be clear. - A son who is grown up. - Enough! - Where are you going? - You said "enough". - Who will prepare my bath? - Oh, yes! My ring! My ring! - What is going on? - My ring! - My ring's disappeared. - Maybe you put it somewhere else. - I put it here. Franco saw it. - It's true, I saw it. - But I don't know if you took it. - I didn't. And you must be a witness because someone stole it. - Who, excuse me? - Carlo. Carlo stole it. That's nonsense. Carlo isn't capable of stealing. - Then you stole it. - No, madam. - We steal groceries. - Gas. - But we don't touch diamonds. - There's prison for that. Right! With diamonds, you go to prison. And someone will go! - Madam, what do you plan on doing? - I'll report him to the police. No, please, I beg you… If Carlo took it, we'll have him return it, but don't ruin him. - He is our pupil. - Go away. Whoever goes against me pays for it. Always! - Please… - The Chief, please. - It is something serious and urgent. - Think it over, madam… Good evening. I am Mrs. Vannucci and I live in Via Appia Antica. At Villa Letizia. A young man, Carlo Carrera, who I generously hosted in my home, has run away with my ring worth five million. Yes, Chief, I'll give you all the information. "Arrested in the villa of his benefactor." "Young waiter steals a diamond worth five million." "Carlo Carrera denies the charge, but the evidence against him is damning." - It's incredible! - Why did he do it? - He must have gone mad. - He was first in his class! At times, the first in class are the last in life. - There's Lorena! - Don't say anything. What is it? Nothing… It's nothing to her. I hope it's nothing to you too. Carlo isn't a thief! He's not a thief! He's not a thief! - Good morning, miss. How are you? - Fine. - Please sit down. - Thank you. For my grandmother's golden anniversary, my mother would like to give her a ring like this. - Lovely! - Can you make an identical one? Yes, I have the diamond and the setting is simple. I can make a perfect copy. My mother gave me this check for five million. Is that enough? Yes, more or less. I'll settle the bill with your mother. Can you make it right away? Alright, I'll do what I can. Please, is it possible for this evening? Alright. Try coming by around 5:00. I'm counting on it! Goodbye. Give my respects to the prince and to your mother. We clashed! It's not here. Ciccio, I found it. Here it is! Here it is! - Don't shout. - I will shout! - You found it? - It was shining… Moron! Ciccio, look. - Miss Lorena. - What does she want? She will tell us. - Come. - Let's go. Miss, what are you doing here? - The ring that Carlo took. - How did you get it? Don't ask me questions. Tell the lady you found it on the floor or in the garden. - Please, I want to save him. - So Carlo stole it? No! Please, do as I say. - How much does she care for him? - Five million. A feeling worth five million. - Let's go see madam. - I found it! Madam! We found it. - Where? - In the living room, under the sofa. It's not true! I know where you found it. What is she saying? How is it possible? - Understand? - You are a scoundrel. - A cheat! Come. - Let me go! - Come with us to the bathroom. - You are dirty inside and out. Let me go! Let's put her big feet in here. - Ciccio, turn on the water. - Help! Hot water and cold water. You'll learn how to behave. It's hot! You'll see what treatment you get! You are a big scoundrel. You wanted to send our pupil to prison. - He stole your ring, huh? - Speak up! - Yes, I'll speak. - Will you tell the whole truth? I'll tell the whole truth, I swear. Yes, I'll tell the truth. I swear. The doll didn't resist our questioning and she told the truth. I'm going to make a phone call. I'll go call and come back. You want perfume? I'll give it to you right away. Here! The perfume. - I'm going to call. - Enough! The phone… Where is the phone? The phone… the phone… It must be upstairs. The phone… It must be over there. The phone… Where is the phone? It must be over here. Maybe it's over there. Where is the phone? Orlando Furioso! It was here. Not here either. Here it is! The number… Hello? Police station? But I saw it! Police station. Hello? Who isn't speaking? We'll come in person. Thank you, Franco. Thank you, Ciccio. That boy cares for us. I am sure he'll go back to study without an inferiority complex. He will give us much satisfaction. - We did a good job! - But we don't have a job. Don't worry, jobs are like women. - You lose one and find 100. - You're a philosopher. - Listen to the music! - What? Come. Silence! Listen. Mr. Diplomatic Corps, do you have engine problems? I don't understand why it won't start. May I take a look? I'm a driver and a mechanic. - Thanks. Very kind of you. - Open the hood. Ciccio, assist me. The distributor cap is missing. It's there! Did you remove it? Start the engine. Great! How did you do it so quickly? - I have a good hand. - A quick hand! Very good! Do you want to be my driver? - Ciccio, shall we accept? - Yes. - What about him? - He's the butler. - I already have a butler. - Fire him. We work as a couple. Take it or leave it. Take it. Don't lose this occasion. - Alright, I'll take it. - Ciccio, get in. We have a pupil who's getting a diploma who lives with us. - The pupil, no. - Then forget it. Get out, Ciccio. Just a moment! I'll take the pupil too. - Then move. I'll drive. - After the pupil, enough. Which is the clutch? - The handbrake. - Oh, right! Why? Why does tonight Have longer hours That never pass? Why does each minute Last an eternity? When the sun will return And in the sun I will come to you Another man You will find in me Who can no longer Live without you When the sun will return And in the sun I will come to you Love, love Run to me And the night will never come again Why? Why are my thoughts Always the same And never change? Why is the silence Also talking about you? When the sun will return And in the sun I will come To you Love, love Run to me And the night will never Come again THE END
