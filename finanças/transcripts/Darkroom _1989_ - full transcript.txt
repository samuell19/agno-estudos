I just think they shouldn't have to do women's work. - Women's work. Yes, I know. Some things never change, I guess. - So are you gonna tell us what happened to this boyfriend of yours? - They had a fight. - No, we didn't have a fight. - I thought you said he was going to join us. It is time I met him. - He was but I think he had to work. He's been busy, really busy. - Yeah, they had a fight. - Cindy, go and tell the boys dinner's ready. - Mark, Perry, dinner! - Cindy, go and tell them. - Yes, Mom. - You two must be getting serious. - What makes you think so? - Well you haven't been home in so long, I just figured it was because of this young man. - It hasn't been that long. I was here for Christmas. - That was two Christmas' ago. - You're right. - So, you wanna tell me about your little tift? - Nothing to tell, it's the same old thing. He wants to get married. - Oh, horrors. What a fiend. - Very funny, Mom. I'm just not ready. - [Mark] God, you act like I ruined it. - It's not the point, I don't take your things and leave them all over the place. - You got it back, didn't ya? - Look, I don't care if you borrow my things, just put 'em back where you found 'em. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Okay, what's for supper? - Nothing unless you two settle down. Ah, where's Gramps? - I'm here, let's eat. - Cindy, is Paula back yet? - Not yet. - Well, we're not gonna wait for her. - Great. (crickets chirping) - Here you go, Mark. - Thanks. (doorbell ringing) - Who can that be? - I'll get it. (crickets chirping) - [Steve] Hi. - Steve, what are you doing here? - I thought I was invited? Mm. - You said you weren't coming. I didn't hear you drive up. Where's your car? - Oh, it died. I had to leave it in town. Some guy gave me a lift part of the way. I had a hell of time finding this place. Jesus, I mean, talk about the boonies. - I'm glad you made it. Come on in, I want you to meet the family. Everybody, this is Steve. This is my sister Cindy. - Hi. - Hi. - Mark and Perry, my cousins. - Nice to meet ya. - Same here. - And this my grandfather, Forrest Hodge. - How do you do, sir? - Pretty damn good. So you're the young fella Janet's been telling us about. - Well, I certainly hope so. (Forrest chuckling) - [Janet] And this is my mom. - I'm so glad you were able to come down. - Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Templeton. - Janet has told us so much about you. - Don't worry, I lied. - Perry, don't just sit there. Get Steve a chair. I'll get another setting. (door clacking open) - You're a lot cuter than your picture. - Thank you. - Janet tells me you're a photographer. - Yes, in fact, that's how she and I first met. She gave me my first big break. She was the prettiest advertising exec I'd ever seen. - That must be a pretty glamorous job. - Well, it's a lot of work but it has it moments. - Do you ever get to work with models? - Sometimes. - Too many times. - Steve, since you're the guest here, why don't you go ahead and say grace. - Okay. (ominous music) (swing creaking) That's the F-stop. (dice clattering) - What's the F stand for? - And, ah, this is the focus. - Ah, another F word. - You know, there are some Indians who believe that if you take their picture, you'll capture their soul. (swing creaking) - Well it's getting late. I better do the dishes. - Can I help? - Oh, no, you're the guest. - Besides, that's women's work. - I'll do 'em, Mom. - Oh, well thanks, honey. - Do you want me to fix a plate for Paula? - She can get it herself later. - She out's with George. She won't be back till real late. - Shut up, Mark. - So, Steve, you can't get Janet here to tie the knot, huh? - Pardon me? - [Forrest] You wanna marry her, don't ya? - Gramps. - So why don't you marry the boy? - Dad, shush. - Time someone made an honest woman out of her. - Gramps, let's drop it now, okay? - Okay. - Steve, you must be tired. Mark, would you show Steve to his room? I know you two are living together, but I'm old fashioned. - That's okay, Mrs. Templeton, I understand, and deep down inside, I'm old fashioned, too. (dice clattering) - I'll show him. Come on, Steve. Gramps, behave yourself. - Behave myself? Behave? - Dad. - Goodnight, everybody. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (dice clattering) You're just down the hall. Second door on the right. (atmospheric music) - Where are you? - I'm right there. The room with the locked door. Goodnight, Steve. I'm really glad you decided to come after all. - Yeah, me too. I can't resist home cooking. (Janet scoffing) (blowing kiss) (ominous music) (door creaking) (door creaking) (lock clacking) (curtain clacking) (water spraying) (ominous music) (Janet humming) (ominous music) (Janet humming) (Janet humming) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (ominous music) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (hairdryer whirring) (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (door creaking) (door creaking) (door creaking) (Steve breathing heavily) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (Janet gasping) - Jerk! What are you doing here? - You didn't think I was gonna spend the night alone, did ya? - As long as we're in my mother's house. - Get out of here, you're not serious. - You bet I am. Besides, if she wanted us to sleep together, she would have offered. - Oh. (groaning) - Go away. - [Steve] Come on, I just wanna talk. - Sure, you wanna talk. - Don't you believe me? - No. If you wanna talk, then talk, otherwise, hit the road. - Okay. What do you wanna talk about? - (sighing) I don't. I wanna go to sleep. - Can't we just cuddle for a minute? - Alright. - I like your family, they seem really nice. - I'm glad. - Your mom seems a little uptight about Paula. What happened to her tonight? - I don't know. Last time I saw her, she was going to break up with her boyfriend for the 20th time. - Who is he? - George Campbell. He worked in the groves a couple of summers ago and just charmed the pants off her. He's real strange. He ran away from home when he was 15, and he lives in trailer somewhere near the river. - Sounds charming. How could she go for a guy like that? - Paula was always a little on the wild side. - Seems to, ah, run in the family. - Yeah, I noticed the way Cindy was looking at you tonight. - Yeah, me too. Don't worry, I'm a one sister kinda guy. (atmospheric music) - Steve. - I know, I know, I gotta go. - No, not yet. (door creaking) (ominous music) (bin thudding) (solution sloshing) (solution trickling) (solution trickling) (birds chirping) (footsteps shuffling) - [Janet] Mom, is everything alright? - I'm so mad at Paula. - Why? - She didn't come home last night. I thought she had come to her senses. I thought she was gonna put an end to it. - Don't worry, Mom, she'll come around. - It's not the first time she's done this but I swear, it'll be the last. - I'll tell you what, Steve and I will bring her back. Did you get any sleep at all? - Not really. - Why don't you go upstairs, get some rest. We'll take care of Paula. - Thanks, honey. I'll just lie down for a few minutes. (wrench clattering) - Gramps, coming in for breakfast? - Ah, no pal, I ate already. - What's wrong with the car? - I don't know. It was fine yesterday and now the damn thing won't start. You're up early. - Ah, yes sir. I got a lot to do. - I wish you'd get some work done around here instead of spending so much time tromping around all over the place. - Me? - Yes, you. You've been acting real funny lately. You wander off all the time, disappear for hours on end. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Nevermind. Now just try to remember, a lot of things around here that need to get done. - Yes, sir. - Oh, man, that was terrific. That was really terrific. - What do you sound so surprised for? You've always liked my cooking. - Yeah, but this is the first time I've had anything you've cooked by hand. - How does she usually cook it? - She nukes it. (Cindy laughing) - [Janet] I think he's referring to our microwave. - Oh, we've been trying to talk Aunt Nora into buying one. - Trust me, if this is any indication, you don't want one. - Ah, I promised Mom we'd go get Paula. You wanna play guide and show us the way to George's? - Sure. - Where's George's? - It's down by the Ritter house near the river. - Really? I don't suppose there'd be any fish in this river of yours, would there? - Yeah, it should be pretty good this time of year. - I hate fishing. It's so slimy. - You got any poles? - Oh, I don't know, I haven't fished in a long time. - You wanna come? - I can't, I got chores. - Mark? - No, I'm gonna work on my bike. - Come on. - Where? - To find your fishing pole. - [Cindy] I'd love to help Steve find his fishing pole. - Cindy, please. After you. Now if I could only find those stupid poles. - Hey, what's behind this door? - That was my father's darkroom. He was a real photography nut. - No kidding, I didn't know that. You never talk about your father much. - What do you wanna know? - All you ever told me is that he died about 10 years ago. I don't even know how. - Well, there was a fire at my uncle's house. (atmospheric music) No one knows how it started. My father, my aunt and uncle were trapped. - That was Mark and Perry's parents? - Mom took them in. They've been with us ever since. - I'm sorry. (Janet screaming) What's wrong? - Uh, spider webs. Ah, dammit. God, I hate spiders. - Oh, come on, they don't eat much. - Thanks a lot. (Steve chuckling) - [Steve] Hey, what's this? Maybe they're in here. - No, that's a crawlspace. It's probably full of rats. Come on. - Okay. - Uh-huh. Success. - Wow, they haven't used these things in years. Hmm, they look okay, though. Now all we need is a little luck. - Let's get out of here. - Look out, here come the rats eating. (shrieking) (Janet yelping) - You belong in a home. - You're crazy about me. - I am? - Trust me. (Steve shrieking) (Janet yelping) (Steve and Janet laughing) - Cindy? - God, will you smell that air. - [Janet] I don't trust air that I can't see. - Oh, you know, you have to admit it's very beautiful here. - [Janet] Yeah, it's a great place for families and dead people. - You know all kidding aside, this would be a great place to raise some kids. (Janet sighing) What's the matter? - You promised, no pressure. - What the hell do you want me to do? - I told you, I'm not ready. - Will you ever be ready? What's it going to take, huh? - I just need time. - Jesus, how much time? One of these mornings you're gonna wake up and I'm not gonna be there. - I'm all set, let's go. - Which way are you guys headed? - Straight down the river that way. - You guys go ahead. I'll catch up. - Steve? - I guess my timing's not so great, huh? Uh, that bad? - Let's go. (birds chirping) (ominous music) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (flash bulb clacking) (dramatic music) (flash bulb clacking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) - [Cindy] Do you wanna talk about it? - What? - The fight. - What makes you think we had a fight? - (chuckling) Well, I don't know. I guess the way you two stopped talking the minute I showed up. - (chuckling) Well, it was just a tiny fight. - Hmm. Well he sure seems like a nice guy. - He is. - Then why don't you two just go ahead-- - You mention one word about marriage, and I'll rip your head off. - Well, if you're not gonna do that thing you just told me not to say, can I have him? (Janet chuckling) (Cindy laughing) - I really missed your delicate sense of humor, Cindy. Of course you can, over my dead and lifeless body. (Janet and Cindy chuckling) Come on, let's get Paula. The first time I met Steve, he was surrounded by all of these gorgeous models at this party, but he called me the next day and said he really enjoyed talking to me and he wanted to see me. - That's nice. (dramatic music) (Cindy and Janet screaming) (Steve laughing) - Steve, you schmuck, you scared the shit out of us. (Steve laughing) It's not funny. - [Steve] Okay, I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. - Why'd you go back to the house? - My camera. Smile, girls. (camera clicking) For posterity. - Come on, you jerk. (Cindy laughing) - Jerk? (birds chirping) (truck engine whirring) - Don't cheat. - [Travis] Morning, Nora, Forrest. - Travis, what brings you all the way out here? - Well, I got some unpleasant news. I think Norm Ritter didn't show up for work, and his phone's out. - Is that so? - I just came from his place. He and his wife seem to be missing, and it looked like there might have been some foul play. - My Lord. - I just wanted to know if you'd seen or heard anything out of the ordinary? Anybody hanging around that shouldn't be? - No, not at all. - How 'bout you, Forrest? - No, no, nothing. Excuse me. (ominous music) - Kids around, I'd like to talk to 'em. - They're all out right now. - They be back soon? - I really don't know. - I'll drop back by later then, alright? Hey, I heard Janet's in town for a spell. How's she doing? - Doing fine, Travis. She's doing just fine. - Mm-hmm, that's great. How 'bout yourself? - Paula ran off with that damn George Campbell again. I'm worried about her, Travis. - Don't worry, Nora. She'll come home, she always comes home, and if she doesn't, I'll personally drag her butt back here. - [Nora] Thanks, Travis. (truck engine whirring) - Mark's not in the house. Do you know where he might be? - I haven't the vaguest. - I'm going after Denton. - What for? - Something I should have told him. - Well, what, for heaven's sakes? - It's probably nothing. Just something bothering me. - How are you gonna get there? You said your car's not running. - [Forrest] I'm taking Janet's. - You shouldn't do that. Not without asking her. - She won't mind. She's family. (ominous music) - This is it? Let's go fishing. - No, let's get Paula first. Besides, there are probably a million mosquitoes who call that place home. - Alright, alright. - You know, I think George lives around here somewhere. - Somewhere? Somewhere? I thought you knew where he lived? - (sighing) Give me a break. I've only been there once. (suspenseful music) (flesh squelching) (Forrest groaning) (Forrest groaning) (camera clicking) (Forrest gasping) (birds chirping) - That's it? - [Cindy] Yeah. - Lovely. I've gotta have a talk with Paula. (ominous music) (George grunting) (fists whacking against face) Stop it! Stop it! (Steve groaning) Stop, stop it! Stop it! (dramatic music) (Janet gasping) Are you alright? - Christ, who was that? - I don't know. - It was George. It was George Campbell. - That was George? What is he crazy? - Oh, I'd say he's got a 50-50 shot. (flies buzzing) - Paula? Paula? (dramatic music) Oh, my God! - Paula! (crying) - No, that bastard. That bastard! - Don't, don't touch anything till we call the police. - I can't just leave her here like this. I can't. - We have to, now come on. (Cindy sobbing) (flies buzzing) (Cindy sobbing) (ominous music) (killer breathing heavily) (suitcase latches clicking) (phone clattering) - The phone's dead. - What do you mean it's dead? (phone clattering) Oh, she's right. - Oh, the Ritters. Well you went there, right? - It's not good. The place was wide open. There was nobody there. - Did you try their phone? - The line has been cut. - Why did Mom let Gramps take the car? - Let's not lose control here. He'll be back soon. There's nothing we can do till then. - If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna find George Campbell and rip his goddamn throat out. - I just don't understand why he would go and do something like that. - Look, look, you said she was gonna end it with him, right? That must have just pushed him right over the edge. He always was a nutcase. - What's happened? (dramatic music) Where's Paula? - There's been an accident. - But she's not hurt. - Mom, Paula's, she's dead. - No, oh, my God! No! - Mom? - Let's get her upstairs, come on. - Mom? - Come on. (ominous music) - It's like she's not even breathing. - She's probably just in shock. You okay? - No, I'm not okay. Goddammit. - [Steve] We've gotta get some help. - How? - I'll got to town. - On foot? It's 20 miles. - Well what about a neighbor then? - The Ritters were the closest. There's not another house for at least 12 miles. - Your moped. Can you get that going? - Well yeah, but it's still in pieces. It'd take me a while. - Do it. Just do it, okay? - Okay. - I wish she would just say something. Or cry even. Anything. - Do you think she's gonna be alright? - She'll be fine. - Wait, where are you going? - I'm going back out to Paula. - What, are you crazy? You can't go back out there. - I can't leave her like that. I won't touch anything, I just, I just wanna cover her body. - Listen to me, what's happened to Paula is horrible, but you cannot go wandering around out there with that maniac on the loose. - I can take care of myself. - You're not making any sense. - I'm not gonna leave her like that! - Okay. We'll be right back. - I'm going with you. - No, I don't think that's a good idea. - She's my sister too. I'm going. - Okay. Perry, you stay with mom. - I will. (atmospheric music) - Okay now, let's keep our eyes open. (screwdriver clacttering) (object clacking) (screwdriver clattering) (atmospheric music) (truck engine whirring) - Chief! Chief! Chief! - Hold on, hold on, Perry, calm down. What's this all about? - It's George Campbell, he killed Paula. He killed her, Chief! Janet and Cindy just went down to take care of the body. - Christ. Look, can you show me where? Just show me where. - I can't, Nora's in awful shape. I can't leave her. - Just tell me then. - It's down at his place, down near the river. - Look, you just stay put. (truck engine whirring) (truck engine revving) (ominous music) (flies buzzing) - Look at this. - Come on, don't, don't, don't. There's not time to play detective. - Sam, Sam, come in! Goddamn it, where the hell are ya when I need ya? (branches rustling) (board thudding against head) (Travis groaning) (board clacking) (dramatic music) (Travis groaning) You son of a bitch. What the fuck? No, hey, come on, man! Don't! No! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - This way. (dramatic music) - (gasping) Oh, my God! (screaming) Oh, God. (crying) - Great, now the bastard's got a gun. (dramatic music) Shit. Shit! It's empty. - There are bullets in his belt. - I'll get them. - God, are you insane? Don't go back there. (crying) - Come on. - There were three bullets. - Maybe Gramps is back and we can get help now. - I'm sure he is. Let's go. - Did he find you? Chief Denton, I sent him to look for you. - (crying) He's dead, Perry. George killed him. - What? - Let's get inside. (door creaking) Is Gramps back yet? - No. - Where's Mark? - Last I saw him, he was down in the basement working on his bike. (ominous music) - Mark? Mark? He's not there. - Hey. - Where have you been? - I was fixing my bike. - Where? - What, I was just testing it, why? - Because somebody just killed Chief Denton, that's why. - What do you mean, somebody? It was George. - We don't know that. - What is the matter with you? - No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go sit with mom. - I'm going for help. Give me the keys to your bike. - No, I'll go. - Mark. - It's my bike, I'll go. I'm not a kid. I'll be back. - Mark? - What? - I think something must have happened to Gramps. He's been gone too long. It's too dangerous, I don't want you to go. - Well it's our only chance. (moped engine whirring) (moped engine revving) (birds chirping) (door creaking) - um, I'll be in my room if you need me. (moped engine revving) (dramatic music) (George grunting) (Mark gasping) (dramatic music) (atmospheric music) (George whimpering) - God, I can't stand this waiting. - Don't worry, Mark will be okay. - There's somebody out there! - What? - Out there, there's somebody watching us! It must be George. - Come on, let's get him. (dramatic music) You take this. - I'm going with you. - You stay here, we'll be fine. - Come on. (ominous music) - Perry? Better kill the light, he'll see us. - Right. Over here. (Steve gasping) (ominous music) - Shit. Perry? Perry? - [Perry] I'm right here. (groaning) Steve, ah, help me! Steve! (groaning) Steve, (groaning) Steve, help! (dramatic music) (ominous music) - Oh, Jesus, Perry. Hey, stop, stop! (dramatic music) Hey! (ominous music) (suspenseful music) Oh, my God. (object thudding against head) (crickets chirping) - It's been too long. I'm going after them. - Are you out of your mind? What about us? - You'll be safe. Keep the door locked behind me and don't open it for anyone. Anyone. (Cindy crying) (lock clacking) (suspenseful music) (water spraying) (dramatic music) (knocking on window) (glass shattering) - It's okay, it's me. Open the door. (knocking on door) (Cindy crying) - Oh, God, you got hurt. - No, I'm okay. George jumped me, but I nailed him with the flashlight real good and he got away. Where's Steve? - He's still out there. Janet went to look for both of you. Oh, Perry, why did this have to happen? (crying) - It's okay, it's gonna be alright, Cindy. - [Cindy] Oh, God. (crickets chirping) Perry, what are we gonna do? (atmospheric music) - Don't worry. Janet will be back soon, and I'll be with you. - I'm just so scared. - What are you doing? - Kiss me. (hand whacking against cheek) - Stop it! What's gotten into you? (ominous music) - Smile for me, Cindy. (camera clicking) (Cindy crying) (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) (ominous music) (camera clicking) I want you to smile the way he made her smile. - Perry, are you crazy? - I said, smile! - Stop it, you're scaring me. - Dumb women. (Cindy gasping) He got to her just like Paula. - What? - I followed her and that George Campbell creep back to her shack. She let him do it. (flash bulb clacking) Just like Mama let your father, (flash bulb clacking) so I had to stop it. - You killed her? - Killer her? Did I? I saw her with George. I wanted to kill him. The bastard got scared and ran away. I did. (Cindy crying) I had to care of Paula. Smile. Smile, don't be shy. (flash bulb clacking) - Okay, I'll smile. Just tell me what you want me to do. (ominous music) - I want you to die. - No, fuck you! You go to hell, Perry. - I'm sorry, Mom, (flash bulb clacking) but I saw you with uncle Jack. (flash bulb clacking) I had to do it. (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) It had to stop. (flash bulb clacking) I didn't know Daddy'd come back. (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) I didn't want to hurt him. (ominous music) - I'm not your mother, Perry. No! (gasping) - Look at these pictures. A lot of these are just like the ones your dad used to take. See. (Cindy crying) There's Paula. Oh, this one, I'm particularly proud of this one. (camera clicking) She saw me coming back from George's, and she'd tell everybody and then no more Perry. Oh, see, before and after. - No, no. I can't. - Oh, and here's her husband. (camera clicking) Oh, and here's Gramps. (camera clicking) Look at them, goddammit. - No! (dramatic music) Leave me alone! No, Mama, please help, please, Mama! God! Mama, please wake up. Mama, help! (screaming) No, Perry! (phone whacking against head) (Perry grunting) (phone whacking against head) (Perry grunting) (dial tone beeping) - [Operator On Recording] If you wish to place a call, please hang up and try your phone again. If you need help, dial your operator. This is a recording. (dial tone beeping) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (Janet screaming) (gun firing) (rope cricking) (ominous music) (door creaking) - Cindy? (stairs creaking) (Nora gasping) Mom? You feel any better? - I'm so dizzy. What am I doing here? Did I faint? - You just kinda blacked out. - Paula. I remember now. (ominous music) (flash bulb clacking) (woman moaning) (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) (dramatic music) (flash bulb clacking) (flash bulb clacking) (Janet moaning) I feel so weak. - Just take it easy. - I'll be fine. (ominous music) Where's Cindy? - I'm not sure. I don't know. Resting, maybe. - I had the worst dream. It scared me so much. Cindy was there, and George Campbell kept hitting her with something. (phone whacking against head) He just kept hitting her again and again. And she was screaming. And asking for help. - It was just a bad dream. - There was blood all over her. And she grabbed me. Look, it really happened. - No, you must have scratched yourself. - No, find Cindy, please. (door creaking) - Cindy? (door creaking) (knocking on door) (door creaking) Cindy? (ominous music) (gasoline splashing) Oh, shit. (gasoline splashing) (Janet gasping) (dramatic music) (ax banging against nail) Mom, listen to me. We've gotta be quiet and get out of here. He killed them all and I think we're next. - I told you George Campbell was here. I saw him. I told you. - Not George, Mom, it's Perry. - Ah, but, but Perry? What are you talking about? - Shh. Come on. (door creaking) - He-- - Shh. (footsteps shuffling) Goddamn. (dramatic music) - [Perry] Janet? Janet? (door banging) - What was that? - He's looking for us. (dramatic music) - Gas all over. - He's gonna burn the house down. (suspenseful music) - [Perry] Aunt Nora? Where are you guys? I wanna talk to you. Janet?
