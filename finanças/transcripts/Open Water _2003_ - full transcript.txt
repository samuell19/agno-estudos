Hey, Don, it's Daniel. Listen, don't put the boiler in until I get back. The framing inspection isn't for a couple of weeks, so we got plenty of time. And I'll check in with you guys in a couple of days, ok? Take care. Bye. First thing I would do is try to find another producer. There has got to be somebody else in town who can help us out, just for the pre-game. Oh, hold on just a second, Cal. Hey, just one second. I got to go. Call me back if you need me. Good luck. Ok, bye. Hey, I'm so sorry. What's up? I got stuck on the phone with Cal. Yeah, the crew hasn't even made it to the arena yet. It's not good. I don't know what they're going to do. Are all the lights out? Nope, they're all on. Just checking. Are you sure you want to lug that thing with you? I don't even think we can get online there. Oh, we can, I checked. All set? Let's just try to remember... It's Cal. Hey, just... just a second. This is supposed to be a vacation. I know. And, boy, do we need one. Hey, what's up? Well, that could work. I'm going to get wet. All right. Hey! Hey. We're all set for the morning. We have to be at the dock at 8:30. Did you have a nice shower? Yes. Great. I'm so glad I made you bring this. Scattered thunder showers tomorrow night, late. Looks like it's going to be crowded on the boat tomorrow. I hope it's not a cattle boat. Well, we'll just do our own thing. Did you ask? No, but they seem pretty relaxed. Why is it so hot in here? Air conditioner's busted. That figures. We didn't come for the room. That's for sure. Considering how much time we had to put this whole thing together, I'm amazed we got anything. I'm not complaining. Yes, you are. All right, I'm done. You want to check your e-mail? Nope. I'm on vacation. Remember? Right. All right. Aww. Bet that tasted good. Nice face... You, too. Yeah. It's different. I'm a girl. Yeah? Yeah. So how are you? Fine. I'm a little stressed still, I guess. This about work? Yeah, work. Life... Maybe I can get you to think of something else. You ok? I might not be in the mood. Seemed like you might be a second ago. I can go either way, I guess. Maybe I can give you a little nudge. Yeah, I'm not in the mood. That wasn't the direction I was trying to nudge you in. Sorry. I'm just tired. It's been a long day. We can talk. Nah, you're right. We should get some sleep. I am wiped! Very funny. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard the world-famous reef explorer. My name is Davis. I'm going to be one of the guides on board the vessel today. Also, driving the boat, we have Linda and junior. Junior's going to be the next guide on board our vessel. We're going to be heading out to a dive site called magic kingdom. Now, things you'll want to look for down there on this dive... Moray eels, spotted morays. We look for stingrays in the sand. There's angel fish, parrot fish, trumpet fish, dark beauties... Are there any big fish, like sharks, or anything? Yeah, we're going out into the open ocean, so chances are you probably might see a shark or 3. But, you know, like I tell everybody, if you see a shark and you don't want to see it, close your eyes. No problem. Sharks over here are not very aggressive towards human beings, so therefore you don't have to really worry about sharks. Ok? All right, other than that, guys, enjoy the ride out. Ok, guys, if I can just have your attention just for a few minutes, we're going to be entering the water in a minute. Once we assist everybody into their gear, what we want you to do is, have a buddy system, enter the water first. Once the buddy systems are in the water, we're going to have the guided divers, and myself. Linda and junior's going to help you guys get into the water. Linda's our surface support, so if you surface a distance away from the boat, you'll want to let her know that you are ok. This is how you let her know you're ok, by giving her a big "o" over your head. If you're not ok, you do the international distress signal. International distress signal is simple, very easy to do. It's like this. Help! Ok? All right? Very easy, very simple. Once everybody's in the water, um... You want to make your way over to the white bump ball. The white bump ball will be at the stern of the boat. We want you to... That mask over there. Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is that your mask? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm screwing up here. You didn't bring your mask? I brought it. I don't know what happened to it. It's supposed to be here. Sorry. Sorry, everybody. I'm just... You now... Anxious to dive. I don't wanna... do you have extra masks on the... Linda, did you bring extra masks? Got an extra mask, Linda? No, I don't have an extra mask. - Junior? - Anyone? Does anyone have an extra mask? Can't dive without a mask. Yeah, I understand that. Thank you, Travis. Davis. Davis... I'm sorry. Go on. All right, guys, the dive is going to be at a maximum depth of 60 feet, so therefore, we're only going to be down there for about 35 minutes. I'll put my stuff on in the water. Ok. Sorry. You ready? Yep. Are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. I can't equalize my ears. Ok, are you going to abort the dive or are you going to try again to equalize? You ok? I don't think I can go down. All right, do me a favor and flex your b.C., put the regulator in your mouth, and swim back towards the platform. Ok. Up. Stand up. Stretch your knees up. How was it down there? We didn't get down. You didn't? Why not? What happened? Didn't get a chance. Couldn't clear it. Yeah, I couldn't get my ears to unclog. It's rough sometimes, I know. It's happened to me a couple of times. You all right? You feel all right? Yeah. I'm good. Thanks. You mind if I borrow this? Is that ok? I'll bring it right back, safe and sound. Yeah? Sure. Go ahead. Thank you. God bless you. You're wonderful. I love you. Are you going down now? Yeah, yeah. Linda, I'm going down. Hallelujah. The only problem I have is you don't have a buddy right now. I don't need a buddy. I've been diving all my life. Unfortunately, you do from our boat, sir. Your boat... Give me a break. Find a buddy for me, someone down there coming back up. Can you dive with me? I'm going to dive this afternoon. If I don't find a buddy, I can't let you go, sir. Hell or high water, I'm diving, Linda. Find someone. Will you dive for me? Come on, dive. Dive. Yeah. What's your name? I'll go. I'll go. Brian. Brian? All right. Thanks. I'll go. You just earned yourself a cigar, buddy. Let's get this puppy on. All set? Sir, your regulator. Regulator. Yes, sir. Got to have one of those. Ok, let me help you. Have a good dive. Thank you. There's a place in heaven for you. I love you. Thank you! Let go of the regulator in the water. Yee-hah! That was great, my man! Ha ha ha. You all right, Seth? Yeah, I'm good. You good? Thanks, buddy, I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. You're an angel. I needed that. Turn around for me, please. You see that shark down there? Yeah. Everybody enjoy their dive? Yeah! All right, good. We got everybody. Daniel, where's the boat? That's a good question. I guess it's one of those. You've got to be kidding me. It better be one of those. Well, which one do you think? I don't know. Did you get us lost? No. So we're in the right spot? Yes. I'm 90% sure. 90%? Why only 90%? 'Cause the boat's not here. There's a coral head exactly 42 feet below us. I marked it on the way down. Yeah, I can still see the stalks. The stalks? Yeah. There's a 3-prong, like, fork thing right below us. You're unbelievable. You can find some obscure little coral formation in the middle of the ocean, but you get lost going to my mother's. I need an incentive. You love my mother. They obviously cannot see us. Think it's time to swim? Swim where? I don't know, I think that one's the closest. Honey, it's a bad idea. Why? Because we're not sure if that's our boat. And if it's not our boat, then that means we could be swimming farther from our boat. And besides, you know how far away that is? It's really far. It's further than that. And if it's not our boat, they could pull away at any time. And then our fucking boat, wherever the hell it is, will have a hell of a time trying to find us. You going somewhere? Just my face. I hate to tell you this, but I didn't see anything that looked like any kind of a coral formation. Could you just show me? I'd just feel better. Sure. See it? I still didn't see anything. Shit! What? You don't see it because it's not there. So does that mean... Since we surfaced, we're drifting. Well, shit. What does that mean? Should we swim? God damn it, we've wasted all this time. Honey, I hate to tell you this, but swim or not, we're going where this current decides. Are they moving? Hey! Yes! Oh, god. Please let this be them! Oh, finally. It's got to be, right? Yes. They're coming right this way. Yep. You realize that's the distress signal. We're in distress. Thank you. Daniel, did you just pee? Yep. You're so disgusting. You said you were a little cold. Daniel, was that a shark? Maybe. Or a dolphin. If it was a dolphin, you'd be on your way over there to play with it. You obviously think it was a shark. That's all we need right now. It's ok. You were petting a shark less than an hour ago. Please, that was nothing but a big ol' catfish. That was more than 2 hours ago. You know, now I'm starting to really get cold. Oh, god. Mmm. It's ok. Oh, Jesus Christ! I thought he said they never come that close. They also said the boat would be here. It's gone. It was probably just curious. A couple of bodies floating out in the middle of nowhere. I'm sure that's not something it sees everyday. Oh, Daniel, where the hell are they? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It makes me feel better. But what do we do if it comes back? I don't know. Do we splash? Do we stay still? You're the one that watched shark week. First off, we should be in a cage. No, we should be on land. Argh! Sharks are... Sharks are attracted to wounded fish. Ok. So I guess we should just not splash around too much. Just sort of... Stay still? Try to stay still. Oh, god... Ok. I can't stand not knowing what's under me. I'm just going to look, ok? Ok. Ok... Katherine hepburn and Nick nolte in grace quigley. And... Nick nolte... And John malkovich in Mulholland falls. How's that for quick? That was quick. All right, it's your turn. You know... I really just don't feel like playing. Ok. You hungry? Of course. I'm starving. Oh, shit! What? Daniel, something just bit me or... What? Where? It stung me or something... I don't know, it's right down by my ankle. Oh, god, it kills! God damn it! It burns! I don't see anything. Ow! Shit! Did it get you? Yes! What is it? I don't know! But that fucker really stung me! It hurt. What do you think I was trying to tell you? Let's get the hell out of here. Ok. Ok, wait. I think we're away from them. Is that far enough? Anything? You get anything? No. Damn those fuckers stung! I know... Where'd they get you? On my hand and on my leg. Through your wetsuit? I don't know, I guess so. God... Are you ok? No, I'm not ok. Are you ok? I mean, how could we possibly be ok? Come on, honey. I know, I know, I know. I'm sorry. This really sucks, but we're going to get through this. Ok? Ok. Ok. I know, I know. Oh, god. Ok. Ok. I've just never heard of anything so fucked up in my entire life. I mean, who has ever heard of two people getting left in the middle of the ocean before? I have, actually. You have? Yeah. Where? Dive magazines. It's a lot more common than you think. Well, thanks for telling me when we got certified. Over there. Oh, my god! Oh, Daniel... Oh, god please, please, please, let this be them. Oh, god, I don't even care if it is them. Just let them see us and pick us up! Come on. Oh, god. I don't think they can see us. Damn it. Wish we had more sun. They can't see us. I know. Shit. They're leaving. Yeah. Stay close to me. What if they don't know we're missing? There's no way. They took a head count on the boat. I saw it. Our stuff is on board. We have their tanks. And we know we've drifted. It may take them a while, but they will find us. I hate to tell you but... I think my dramamine's wearing off. You're getting nauseous? Yeah. Honey, I could kill those fuckers! I know, it's just all this going up and down on the waves, I think. You're probably getting dehydrated. Yeah? Well, we can't drink the water, right? No. I should have told you that before. You didn't, did you? A little. Oh, honey, stop. It'll give you diarrhea. It'll make you even more dehydrated. Great. Shark week? Disasters at sea. History channel. I guess this means I'm going to have to stop complaining about you watching so much television, huh? Glad to know I'm going to get something out of this. I'm really... Really not feeling well. Oh, honey. You think maybe if I take my weights out, then they wouldn't pull on me so much? Just keep the belt, drop the weights. Let's see them try to charge us for those. Oh, hey, we should put our gloves on. How are your stings? They're there. That's actually the one thing... I think the saltwater is actually helping. This glove isn't helping them. Oh, god. Your stomach's bad? I don't feel very good. All right, honey, why don't you lay back for a little bit? Yeah? Yeah. Just lay back. I'm sorry. It's ok. I got you. Just relax. Ok. There you go. Ok. Just for a few minutes. Just relax, close your eyes. Daniel... I have to pee. Ok. At least we'll be warm for a minute. Thanks. Daniel? Daniel! Oh, god! Daniel! Daniel! Oh, god. Daniel! Susan! Daniel, over here! Susan! Susan! Daniel! Oh, thank god! Oh, yeah. It's ok. It's ok. I got you. I got you. Oh, my god, what happened? I don't know. I don't know. Are you all right? I'm fine. You ok? What happened, where did you go? I must've fallen asleep, and we drifted apart. Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. You scared the hell out of me. I am so sorry. Oh, it's ok, it's ok. I'm just so glad you're here. Oh, my god. It's ok. How long were we sleeping? God, I'm so out of it. Jesus. We've been in the water... Stay over here. We've been in the water for 7 hours. God, Daniel, I feel something on my leg. What? I don't know, it hurts. Your sting? The wrong leg. Oh, my god, it really hurts. Let me just try to get it up so you can take a look. I don't see anything. I can't... Is it on the back? All right. Let me take a look. It hurts all over the whole thing. Just leave it alone, ok? Don't tap on it. I don't want you touching it. I'm not touching it. Well, something's touching it. It's not me, hon. I'm here. My hands are right here. Something is tapping on it! I will take a look. I will take a look. Jesus! Oh, god! Oh, I feel sick! Look, I'm sorry, honey. I threw up. It's ok. Fish gotta eat, too. Speaking of which, that thing pecking at your leg, it's just a little cleaner fish. So what about my leg? It's just a little... A little cut. Well, how did I get cut? I don't know, maybe you rubbed up against my knife while we were sleeping or something. Oh, come on! It wasn't a shark, was it? Oh, my god. God, no, honey. Are you sure? No, if it was a shark, your leg would be gone. Great. At most it was a tiny little barracuda, just checking to see if you tasted good. Oh, god. Is it deep? No. It's not deep. Let's swim out of this puke. Ok. Come on. Is that far enough, do you think? Oh, yeah. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know how much you hate to throw up. You want to rinse your mouth out a little bit? Yeah. Just don't swallow any, ok? Just swal... spit it back out. Oh, god. I can still feel that tapping. What, the fish? Yeah. Try not to focus on it. Just relax. Ok. There you go. Ok. Unh! What is it, honey? Are you ok? What is it, honey? It's a leg cramp. It's a leg cramp. Can I help you? Is there anything I can do? I got it. Ouch. We are really falling apart, aren't we? Oh, my god! Oh, honey. Oh, god! Ohh! They're gone! They're gone! Jesus, Daniel! What kind are they? Big ones. No, I'm serious. Are they the bad kind? I have no idea. Oh, my god. Oh, Daniel! No, no, no. Be still. Don't splash around! Oh, my god! This can't be normal. Oh, god. Honey. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. Are they gone? Oh, god, I don't know what's worse, seeing them or not seeing them. Seeing them. Unbelievable! This is truly UN-fucking-believable! And the best part is that we paid to do this! We paid to be out here! We paid those incompetent fuckers to drop us out in the middle of the fucking ocean! We wanted an ocean view. Boy, did we get it! Those fuckers! You feel better? I wouldn't exactly call it better. You finished yelling? I could be. Well, good. You're not the only one stuck out here, you know. What, are you mad at me? No. Why? Because I was yelling? No. Fine, you be mad. This is a great vacation, honey, isn't it? So now we've entered no-talking phase, huh? Could you maybe answer one last question? Has this somehow, over the hours, become my fault? Let's just drop it. Of course. You believe what you want to believe. But I know for certain that we were in the right spot. It's not just a matter of being in the right spot, it's being there on time! We were on time! We were early! He said 10:30! Do you always have to cut it so close? For god's sake, could it kill us once to stay with the group? Do we always have to do everything differently than everybody else? God, we shouldn't have spent so much time with that goddamn eel! Well, that was a nice touch, adding "we," especially since you wanted to have nothing to do with that fucking eel! Do you honestly... Seriously, honey... Do you honestly think that we got left behind because we were late? I'm serious. Do you have any idea how idiotic that sounds? Oh, so now I'm an idiot? Well, we are where we are, aren't we? Yeah, fine. Yes. Because of me. You refused to swim! Argh! My god, there were boats all around us, and you refused! And now look! Look around us! We are stuck in the middle of the ocean where there's nobody! Even if we had been swimming for the last 5 hours, we would not be any closer to a boat than we are now! The only reason we are even out here in the first place is because of your fucking job! What? If it were not for your job, we would not have thrown our plans out the window, rushed around at the last minute, and settled on this fucking trip! We would be at home, in the middle of our hectic lives, which right now sounds like heaven to me! And in a month's time, as we planned 7... 7 months ago! We would be where we were supposed to be, in the first place! And paying less than we are now to be shark bait! God damn it. I can't even believe you'd bring all that up right now. You were the one that picked the dates. Oh, yeah, of my whopping 2 choices, this was the better date. I wanted to go skiing. Oh, god. I can't believe how far we've drifted. You think the current will take us over there? Hopefully. How's your leg? It's ok. You know, relatively, but it's ok. All right then, let's go for it. I love you. We're going to be fine. Other people go on vacations and spend their days... Just laying around... Eating and drinking. That sounds pretty great right now. Actually, yeah, it does. We have a story we're going to be telling for the rest of our lives. Daniel... What? Look. Wait. Oh, my god! Ha ha ha! Oh, wait. Oh, there are 5 of them. Look. Where did those come from? Oh, you know how dry my mouth gets when I'm diving. I wanted to put them in the dive bag, but you had them, so I stuffed them in here at the last minute. Oh! I never thought anything could taste so good. Just hold me for a second, ok? I got to make sure we don't lose these ones. I got you. Ok. You got it? Yeah. Ooh! Oh, my god! What is it? Are you all right? Yeah. Oh, my god! I don't see anything. Are you ok? I don't know! Oh, my god! Oh, Daniel! Oh, my god! I'm bit! Honey. Oh, my god. I'm bit. The fucker bit me! Ok, ok, hold on! Hold on! Come on. I'm gonna go look. I'm gonna go look. No! Let's see if I can... No, no, no. Let me go look. Stay where you are! Oh, my god! Oh, my god, it fucking hurts! Just breathe, ok? Just stay right there. I'm gonna go look. It hurts. Aah! Ok. I see... I got to see. I'm gonna go look. You keep breathing! Daniel, listen to me! I'm gonna go look, you breathe! I'm breathing! Ok. Just stay where you are. Aah! I can't see. My leg is still there, right? I can feel it. It's ok. It's ok. It's all right, honey. It's ok. Aah! It's not that bad. Ok? You've got... you've got to put something on it. Ok. It is bleeding, so... ok. It's bad, isn't it? No. It's bad, isn't it? It's not that bad. It's not that bad. Ok? It's not that bad. Put something on it. All right. I'm gonna tie something around it. Just keep breathing for me, ok? I'm breathing. All right. God, it fucking hurts! I'm going to tie my weight belt around it. I can't... I can't get a grip. Ow! My god! Oh, god! Oh, fuck! This can't be happening! It's ok. How can this be happening? I think I'm bitten by a shark! We could actually be eaten alive by sharks out here! It's ok. We don't know anybody... We don't know anybody who's ever been bitten by a shark! Listen, it's all right. It's always the same 3 or 4 guys, and they're on the shark shows. They always starve first! My god! Hey, it's all right. It's not that bad! You're going to be fine. Ok? You're going to have a nice scar to show your friends and that's it! Ok? Ok, look at me. Look at me, baby. That's right. That's right. You're fine. It's not that bad. It just hurts right now, the salt water's gonna make it better. It's all right. Oh, my god! It's ok. Oh, baby. It's ok. Oh, god, please. Thy kingdom come... Thy will be done... ahh! Aah! It's ok. You're ok. It's ok. Just hold on. Just breathe. It's ok. It hurts. It's ok. It's ok that it hurts. It's ok that it hurts. It's ok. Oh, god. Something's rubbing against my foot! Oh, my god! What? What? It's big! It's big! It's a big one, isn't it? It's big! I feel it! Oh, Jesus! Oh, god! Ahh, shit! They're behind you! Behind you. I love you. Are you all right? Daniel, stay still. All right? Just stay where you are. Oh, god! It's going to be ok! You hold on! You hold on, Daniel! You don't leave me out here by myself! You promise me, you hold on! Aah! My leg! Daniel! Oh, god! Oh, god! Hello? It's the manager. Hello? So what was the final weight on it? 213. Hey, Lou, give me a nice close-up jaw shot here. The thing works. How's that? Good? Let's see what he ate. Check it out. What's the yellow thing? Wonder if it works.
