The war in Syria forces millions of women, men and children to flee from their country. Hundreds of thousands of refugees reach Germany and Austria via the Balkans. In the spring of 2016, Europe builds border fences to close the Balkan route. Austria expects a shift of the refugee routes to Italy … and announces 'construction measures' at Brenner Pass. What's new in our country? We will soon find out. Welcome to our show. Border fences arriving. First details about Brenner Pass. Protests against mass accommodations for refugees. Therapy possibilities for rheumatism. Clouds in the north, rain and snow in east and south. Preparations for border controls at Brenner Pass intensify. Austria wants to prevent an increased influx of refugees through Brenner Pass … by stopping refugees right at the Austrian border. The Austrian Interior Minister announced that … the controls at the motorway at Brenner Pass will be back. We have to prepare for a shift of the migration route. So the government agreed on preparations. We decided to prepare 12 additional border checkpoints. The so-called border management at the border to Hungary, where thousands of refugees are registered every day, serves as a role model for the border checkpoints in Tyrol. The situation at Karawanken Tunnel differs from that at Brenner Pass. Are there any plans for border fences? I can't confirm that at the moment. For now the traffic at Brenner Pass is running smoothly. It remains unclear when the controls will start or if there will be a fence. The Border Fence - Ladies and gentlemen… - Stop. One moment please, we have a technical problem. If that gentleman there… Well, these are cramped conditions. That's the downside of this historic meeting point. Could I please ask for your understanding and cooperation. The valley bottom at Brenner Pass is approximately … 300 metres wide. It's an urban area. The yellow area on this map is the Austrian-Italian border. The red areas show the notorious border fence, which does not go from one summit to the other. It consists of fence elements. Overall, it measures less than 400 m. 370 m to be precise. It starts in the west, goes east and covers some areas. It's a wire mesh fence, not a barbed wire fence. And all fence elements with a length of 370 metres serve only … to prevent an evasion of the registration office … and to guide persons who try to avoid it to the control point. This is my statement. Apparently, I was not clear enough: Wire mesh fence, not barbed wire fence. A mesh, with 6 corners. No barbed wire. The fence on the terrain is 2.5 m high, in the core area it's 4 m high. When will the construction start? Construction works were supposed to start today. A crucial element in the next phase … would be to construct the fence posts. Austrian Federal Minister Sobotka and … Italian Minister Alfano in the end … agreed to postpone that. To show positive intentions. But I want to say that we will have to … construct the fence posts in any case. As a precautionary measure. It's getting cold now. Yes, I see a few snowflakes. We are a group of citizens, European citizens and citizens of the world. Together as a group of volunteers and grass root activists … we have developed an alternative to the refugee reception of the EU … which consists of walls and borders. We're here today to say that our idea of the European Union … is not built on walls, borders, deportations or unjust laws. If freedom of movement within Europe ceases to exist, Europe itself will cease to exist. We are here to cross the border as a symbolic act of freedom. Let's not forget that more than 40 percent of those … who are trapped in the camps along the borders on the Balkan route … are women and children. And they are being denied access to proper healthcare. We are here today to raise our voices … for all those men, women and children, who suffer the violence of this European Union. The same Europe who has signed a shameful agreement … with Erdogan, the president of Turkey. Let's approach the road block installed by the Austrian police … with courage and determination. Let's raise our voices so our message can be heard. Our Europe has no borders! We're all citizens! - Sit. - You too, sit. What exactly is 'home'? Well, home. This is my home. Tyrol means very much to the two of us. Whenever we travel, we just want to go back home. We are comfortable here, for us it is the best country. Yes, home is everything. Forests, mountains, earth, air. Having nature right at your doorstep, moving freely. Not having to fear anything. I think we don't have to say more, we feel happy here. There is work. We are well off. We can live. That's all a person can wish for in life. - You have to be content. - It's nice here. Especially if you're healthy, and have a hunting ground like this. That's all anyone could ask for. This sign says clearly 'state border'. But as you see, they built a nice stair over there. So that everyone can pass the fence. And the sign over there says 'biking is not allowed'. This is an obvious sign of the state border. There is a sign like that every 200 metres. But everyone can pass here. It's not much of a national border. Everyone can pass. There are no controls. The main topic these days are the refugees. Many refugees pass the 'green' border. I feel sorry for them. A weather like today, wintry, cold, foggy, and they are dressed lightly. I have to say … passing a border in the mountains in such a harsh weather, that's troublesome. That they make it at all. We are dressed in winter gear. They come in summer clothes, have no proper shoes and cross the pass. - That's madness, isn't it? - Yes. Even more when there are families with children. I feel empathy for them. But we have to seize them and send them back. It's difficult. Politics should do something, provide remedy, help these people. - But how? I have no answers for that. - Others must decide that. We haven't seen any over the last 14 days. But you met some before. What is it like? Well, if we meet them, it's our duty to report them to the police. And we do that. They take them away. Once, 15 persons were sitting in Andi's field. I reported it immediately, the police got there quickly. They put them into a bus and drove them away. What are we supposed to do? We can't help them. We have to report it. The police will act properly and decide where they will go. We have no influence on that. And we wouldn't try. Well, you can't transport them all to Italy. If the border is closed, is South Tyrol supposed to take them all? They should do something down there. Italy and the other countries need help protecting the external borders. This would be the starting point. I think, within the EU, it works well without borders. We can drive anywhere, to Germany, to Italy. But as Andi said, if they can't protect it … then I would also support closing the border. So that we are protected. That's nothing against refugees… It's purely about protection. Protection against the infiltration of criminals, as we saw it in Germany. It's not the refugees' fault that they tag along. But we have to protect ourselves. By filtering out the criminals. Letting in the real refugees and sending the others back. Exactly. As of today, police are ready to go. The so-called border management is complete, results are presented. The historically charged border, with new annexes for border controls added. Brenner Pass is prepared for flows of refugees. But as of yet, they fail to appear. Police say they will come anyway. One million people are waiting in Libya, North Africa, to come here. And looking at the situation in Hungary, it will be more and more difficult for migrants to come this way. All these factors do not paint a calm picture. The so-called border control management consists of a few facilities. Construction works took 5 months. Costs: 1.6 million euros. The registration centre is the most important facility. A place where decisions about staying or going are made. The much-discussed and criticised border fence with a length of 370 m … This is where everyone arrives. We carry out the first interview. We collect data. Who is this person? Nationality? What do they want? Many want to go north. This won't be possible and will result in a rejection. Only rejections and asylum requests in Austria will be possible. This is what is decided here, in this office. If the migrants should have a passport, we check it here against national records. That means, only records in Austria, not from the Schengen area. Identification is performed, finger prints and a photo are taken. Then the registration at the border control is complete … and the migrants wait until they are sent back to Italy. They are sent out of the door, and they are in Italy. How exactly should that work? Even the people who decide don't really know how. Well, they might, we in the field can't imagine how. The plan is to wait until a busload is full. Or until 4 or 5 persons are there, depending on our processing procedure. Then we will guide them by foot to the border and send them off to Italy. - Won't they just come back? - I guess so. They will try. If border controls are operational, the border will be guarded by the military. A border fence will be constructed here. And at the main road and the station, police will be stationed … to prevent entry after an official rejection. Here is the head of operations. One officer is sitting here. His task is the administrative control … of the border police here at Brenner Pass. He controls the missions, sends police, manages pickups, transports. Who needs picking up in Innsbruck? Who takes the train at Brenner? It's all controlled here. There is a radio message, and he reacts to it. We picked up one person, male, probably from Afghanistan. He was walking along the main road. Understood. - Was that the AGM? - Yes. The police patrol has picked up an illegal immigrant on the main road. He was picked up and will be brought here for registration. If anything goes wrong, the head steps in and controls the mission. We have no influence. We only hand over facts. The decision comes afterwards. Do you see a sort of emotional detachment in your colleagues? I wouldn't call it detachment. It gets tougher, it gets… I don't want to say burnout… Work has gotten more difficult. From shift to shift. And you are challenged to withstand that psychic pressure. Every day, again and again. Do you have trainings or counselling? There is psychological counselling, but… Everyone can make use of it. For some, it's useful. Others talk with their colleagues … to process these things, everyone must find their own way. But of course, the police offer support. How do most people handle it? They do their work. Do you take much of it home? You do take it home with you, yes. Looking at your family at home … I often tell my children, 'There was a family from Syria here, the children had the same age.' I tell my kids, 'they have no perspective, while you can have everything but are never satisfied.' So I say, 'Look at that, they have two plastic bags. Nothing, they don't know the language. No education. What will they do?' I tell them, 'You have opportunities. Use them.' That's what you take home, of course. What will happen to them? And you think, I wouldn't want to be in their place. Having to move through foreign countries. Not knowing what will happen, where you will end up. Will you even survive? Foreign secretary Kurz wants deterrence in the Mediterranean, holding refugees on islands like Australia does it. To stop a refugee boat on the high seas and send it back … would only be legal if they want to return voluntarily. The right to request asylum must be granted, says European law expert Walter Obwexer. Possibly in a reception centre on an island. Another idea that Europe could copy from Australia, says Kurz. It will be easier to convince people to return voluntarily … if they can be housed and provisioned for example on Lesbos, rather than when they already moved into a flat in Austria or Germany. Kurz is criticised by the Green party and the SPÖ, the FPÖ calls the suggestions hypocrisy. Flight and migration is today's topic of 'Im Zentrum', the expert round hosted by Ingrid Thurnher. I only wish that politicians would understand … that a closed border is never a good thing. The transit traffic that connects the European countries must remain unaffected. I'd be outraged if I couldn't move freely from A to B anymore. More controls are needed, so that our chances of surviving are better. But really, there are no problems at Brenner Pass. The only problem is the human traffickers, nothing else. It can't be that people have to pay them in order to survive. It shouldn't be that way. They go to the police station to register. Then they come back and come here. Some policemen come here and ask us to give them food … and something to drink, and they pay. There are policemen like that. Then those people come here, very polite, close to shy. They are afraid of you. They enter, we welcome them, and ask them what they want. We serve them, and they sit down and wait. For whatever the day brings. They know nothing. Some have a chance to go on, if they have friends who can pick them up. But most travel on by train. The people that come here are quiet, pleasant. Young men, sometimes a group of 6 to 8. They are educated, polite. We have no problems. We never have to call the police. We never had problems with them. They pay what they have to pay. They don't take things they can't afford. Some only have 5 euros. Or only 2 or 3 euros. Then they get as much as they can afford. Maybe we give them a bread or something, if they are hungry. So in general, we have no problems here. No trips implemented from Steinach. Good. Bye. No trips. I want to ask you to especially watch out for … illegal migrants under the low-floor wagons or the semitrailers. Then we will go from wagon to wagon. We'll control all the seals for manipulation … and that the wagons and doors are closed. Or rather that the seals are not ruptured … and that the tarps are closed. And if a tarp is damaged, please report that. We'll then discuss with the Austrian Railways whether to open the train or not. If there are certain suspicions that illegal migrants … are inside a vehicle, or on a wagon, we also have to report that to the Austrian Railways … so that they can switch off the overhead power lines. Only then we can climb up the wagon … and control the wagons from up there. We still do not get any information about a possible border fence at Brenner Pass. Please understand that information regarding this topic … will be communicated by the Interior Ministry and not by us. Congestion and delays are to be expected. A glance at the German border clearly shows this. Does the border mean anything today? Yes, I think it is going to be of greater significance again. Not only because of the border controls but also because of the heavy traffic. This summer there was a lot of congestion. Like never before, just until last week. On weekends, I lose one or two hours in congestion every day. That's pretty annoying sometimes. But the milk has to be delivered regardless. I cross the border once every day and twice every other day. Two and a half years ago here in North Tyrol … a dairy-cooperative was founded. And now they deliver the milk to Sterzing in Italy instead of North Tyrol. The dairy factory we deliver to now … offers a much higher price than the one we worked with before. The farmers are happy, since they get a fair compensation for their hard work. Instead of bringing me the milk frowning … now they have a smile on their faces. Bye! Do you personally know of any problems with migrants here? Well, real problems here… In the town we were before, there are many immigrants … I can't say how many, but some are even in the town council. They have been here for a long time, but their mentality won't ever fully adapt to ours. Some of them may be fully integrated and accept our values … but I firmly believe that the majority of them is not. What are you afraid of? I mean, you can see it everywhere… So many of them are already here, but now, more and more of them are coming here. I think that … given the religious aspects alone … I don't know. There will be problems in the future. I don't have anything against immigrants … but when there's too many … I mean, you can see it here, if they live here, that's fine, but they have their own habits … that they keep up. Like what for example? Well … I guess it boils down to the fact that they know where they come from. I mean, even if they integrate themselves now, when it's getting tough, they know where they belong. Let's be frank on that. If that is going to increase, the next generation will face trouble. They put up some containers right ahead of us on the left. That's a shelter for refugees. - We are still in Austria, aren't we? - Yes, we are, but not for long. The border between Italy and Austria runs through this roundabout. Do you think that our society will change? I think it must change again. For the future. Because … I mean, we all live in prosperity right now. But I think in the future things won't be as good. - Why do you think that? - Well, generally speaking, human beings are never satisfied, we always want more. That's human nature. We always want more. But at some point, there must be a limit. At least that's what I think. Venntal valley is about two kilometres from the highway. It's very picturesque, a little lonely sometimes, and yet close to the city. We have a chapel close to our house. And we have this inn next to the house, which we are running. It's a five-minute ride to the freeway or to Brenner Pass. And it just takes 30 minutes to get to Innsbruck. How do you see yourself? As European, or Austrian … - We are Tyrolean. - Yes. - Absolutely. - We're Tyrolean. We're not even Grieser, we are Tyrolean. - We're Venner. - Yes. And what defines a Tyrolean or a Venner? The beautiful valley. That's not a character trait. I don't know… Loving our country is a character trait. And we do. We want that many of our traditions … shall be maintained. Which won't be possible if we become a mixed nation, as we're about to be. We want to have Christmas, we want to have a traditions club. We want to celebrate our holidays, religious or else. And I guess that's what defines a Tyrolean. The fact that we have a tradition, that we cherish it and care about it. For me, religion is important. My kids don't care so much right now, but that's normal at their age. - Are you one of them? - She is. Well, I have my faith and right now … the faith I have works for me. I admit, I don't go to mass every Sunday, but I have my faith, I pray to God, and that works for me. And well… But you'd never kill for your faith, would you? No, of course not. Yes, we were not raised like that. Well, a few centuries ago the Catholic Church did exactly that. Yes, a few centuries ago, the Catholic Church was on the wrong path. But I think that the Catholic Church has come a long way since then. There are always black sheep. Even in the Catholic Church, still today. But if every member of the Catholic Church … tried to be a better person, the world can only become better, right? And if every Islamist tried to be better, then … the world must become a better place. And I think that holds true for religion as well as for the whole world. If every single one of us … tried to make the world a better and more peaceful place, we wouldn't need any wars. Okay, go. Again. - Enough? - Yes, enough! Yes, this is a drilling unit, made in Italy. A beautiful piece of machinery, very compact. It can reach a depth of 1500 m. We already drilled up to a depth of 1400 m. We're doing test drillings for the BBT, the Brenner Base Tunnel. These drillings are needed to collect all relevant information … for the construction of the tunnel, like water pressure or water level. So that once they start building the tunnel, they'll know how to proceed. All these problems we see in the world today… That's not good for us. Terrorism, racism, and all the unrest in the world today. We must make an effort to live together. We have to be respectful in order to be respected. It is just like with religion. All religions are based on God. You must respect them, Christians should not convert others. And Muslims should not convert others. I am a Muslim, but I am not bothered by Christians. I respect their religion. And they should respect mine. That's how we should live together. War and violence are useless. They serve no purpose. Conflicts must be resolved peacefully. We should know each other. I agreed to this interview only to tell you this. We are all from Senegal. Some might think we're not able to do this kind of work. Once a project manager came to the construction site … and asked one of my Italian co-workers when we'd start building. My colleague replied: You have to ask Abdul, he's in charge. But he didn't want to talk to me. Why? The colour of my skin has nothing to do with my qualifications. It doesn't matter if your skin is white or black because you work with your brain. Of course we have education and experience as well. We have schools and universities too. Why shouldn't we be able to do the same things Italians do? I often hear on TV, 'We must help them in their home countries.' Yes, they must help us in our home countries, but they are the ones exploiting us to begin with. In Senegal, they are going to build new oil rigs. Okay, they want to extract oil. The French or the Brits, I don't know exactly who. But for the most part, that money won't benefit Senegal. Because we can't process the crude oil. If a foreign company does this work, they make the biggest profit. So what's the benefit, if only 20 percent of the money stays in Senegal? I used to think that British people were always friendly… Hello! But this year I met Brits… Thank you, bye. I met Brits who were very cranky. It really alternates. Hello! Thank you. Bye, thank you. I must say that the worst ones are … our German and Italian neighbours. Hello, 9 euros, please. Thank you. Goodbye, thank you. The most laid-back guests are the Swiss. When they have to pay, they just pay. Of course, you get insulted, but… Hello, thank you. You can't let that get to you… Thank you, bye. These people are just passing through. And you can't always be friendly. Because if they… Hello! Of course, we're told we have to be friendly and… Thank you, bye. And we have to be polite and accommodating. But if a customer is rude to me, I sometimes tell him off as well. Hello, 9 euros, please. Road charge, yes. I think that I have the right to be rude if someone behaves disrespectfully. I really don't have to put up with everything. And in the worst case you just have to… Pardon? Yes. And in the worst case, you just have to close the booth. And let them wait until they have calmed down. That would be 44.50, please. Thank you, bye. Yes, that happens sometimes. We're on the southbound lane. Hello, thank you. But… Thank you, bye. But on the northbound lane you see … I mean I can even see it from here. That… Hello, thank you. That a lot of busses and … Bye. … vans get stopped at the checkpoint over there. The police control them. The police station is pretty close, it's in our building. They pull them over … Hello. ... and inspect them. Thank you. I have seen it myself. All of a sudden … a lot of people were standing on the highway. Hello. That's fine, thank you. A lot of people were standing on the highway … because the police caught them. Refugees of course. Poorly dressed, some well-dressed, wearing backpacks. Some were only wearing sandals or flipflops. Some looked very filthy… Yes, well, you see stuff like that. Actually not this year, but last year, I saw it a couple of times. Frankly, and I'm not afraid to say this, there is so much scum here. Bye. They are just unpleasant and do unpleasant stuff. I mean, sure … let me put it like this. I mean… Hello! We're constantly being told that refugees… We must help them. And so we give them 2,000 euros, and a house, and a car, and a cell phone. Because they need it. Well, okay. But… Bye, thank you. But what a lot of people forget is how they were able to… Let's say how they got here. Because many… Hello, 9 euros, please. Because many who would really need help… Bye, thank you. Can't afford to come here. They are still down there, where there is that war. There, they would really need help. But nobody helps them there. Thank you. Because the ones who come over here … Bye. Because the ones who come here are those who … can afford to come here, who had a good job, who could have survived down there too. Hello! Thank you. But due to reasons linked to the war, or because of economic reasons, who knows, Thank you, bye. they did not want to stay there and so they thought, 'Alright, let's emigrate, but in a cheap way.' Hello, thank you. 'Let's pay smugglers to get us there.' Thank you, bye. That's my opinion. Hallelujah. …on the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, in the Holy Catholic Church, in the community of saints. In baptism for the forgiveness of sins. In the resurrection of the dead and eternal life. Amen. Another note before I say something about today's gospel. Please do not serve drinks during Holy Mass. This is very important to me. As I already said: I am not here to entertain you. Jesus did not come to cause division. He came to bring peace. He did prophesy … that those who stand up for truth and fairness … they actually cause division and unrest. Therefore let us act the way Jesus would act. Let's promote truth. Let's promote fairness. I do not mean an abstract truth. No, the truth that we encounter every single day. We should put this truth into practice. Let's not start with discussions about what truth is. No, the truth, that we experience every day. To say nice words about our fellow men and women. Do not spread rumours that are not true. So, I mean the truth of everyday life. Everyone of us knows this truth. - What is 'Schopf'? - Pork, but it is good. Okay, I'll take that and … goulash, fried sausages, and krapfen. - How many? - One krapfen. - 29 euros, please. - Is that one… - Yes. - Okay, then I'll take another one. That's 31.50 euros. No, 30, sorry. - Do you maybe have 50 cents? - I'll check. 20, 30, 40, 50, I've got it. Here, everyone knows everyone. There is a special connection. The community here is very strong. It's strengthened by local clubs, the voluntary fire brigade, the music chapel, customs and tradition clubs. It is something natural. It's not only tradition. Although there are beautiful traditions, but people really want to cooperate, they want to help together. I want to say that these people … do have this sensitivity, they do feel empathy for the refugees. But their empathy or goodwill … is always connected with their fears. And this is where first rejections stem from. When they say, 'We don't want any refugees.' But I believe, if you really inform the people … and teach them that refugees are people just like we are, only that they don't have a home anymore … then, I think, the people would want to help. I would not say that the people have right-wing beliefs. But as I said, in-depth explanations might be needed. Because if you turn on the TV, the news conveys a certain image. And I think that those people… We don't only think locally, we think globally. And if you look at the state of the world today, then we say, we don't want these kinds of refugees. These free-range geese are a niche product. They are organic free-range geese. They weigh around 5 kilos. They are approximately five months old. And will be sold for the feast on St. Martin's day. We will send them to Bressanone for butchering. There is a special slaughterhouse. It adheres to the EU regulations for organic products. Organic means it must adhere to the regulations … and it must provide the according equipment. Stress-free slaughter is the watchword. That's what they do. In Tyrol, we do not have such a slaughterhouse. Why not? Why do the Italians have it? Italians are clever. Does Austria have many profitable business relations to Italy? There are increasingly more, yes. In my opinion, still not enough. But there is development. Private and personal initiative is needed. I would not recommend relying on politics. Politics loves to march with the local tradition clubs. And that's that. Except for that, nothing much happens. Thank God we were able to prevent them from … building border walls and fences at Brenner Pass. - So that definitely won't happen? - I think so, yes. Even Interior Minister Sobotka had to accept that. That things are different here, if you want to build walls between European countries. And it is even more different if they want to build walls in Tyrol. He learnt that pretty quickly, though. He seems capable of learning. But they are still working on that project. That wouldn't surprise me. Politicians must appear as if they do something for the people. Because the people are so afraid. Their fear is so pervasive. They fear the people that had to flee and leave their homes. They do provoke fear. This is a schizophrenic, a truly tragic situation. To fear those who had to flee from war. Who had to flee from violence. Who had to leave their homes. Usually, you do not have to fear people like that. No one likes to leave their home. But what are the people afraid of? Well. That is a question for psychologists. They should rack their brains. There is no reason for this fear. But fear must be fuelled, because it is good for politics. To stir up fear. And it is fuelled by those who call themselves 'the movers'. The 'future generation'. But they actually live in the past. So everything is ready for the border controls now? Allegedly, everything is ready. Well, that's true. But to set up border fences, that's something else. We will see about that. My guess is, they can't get away with that. I really cannot imagine that … a democratically elected government in Austria can take this liberty. I really can't imagine that. They took the liberty in Spielfeld and other borders… But those are other borders. They do not have the same history … like the border on Brenner Pass. The border at Brenner Pass is special. The people here want this fence, don't they? I do believe so, yes. I do believe that. But would they still want that, if they knew the whole story? If the important parties, the so-called leading parties, if they would finally be willing to discuss … what a border fence really means. What are the economic and socio-political consequences? What does it mean for European cooperation, for the Accordino? What does it mean for the European Region Tyrol? What are the consequences? These facts need to be discussed. And politicians should agree to discussions. Not only some activists like Mr. Gurgiser or Mr. Hörtnagl. They don't matter. It should be discussed on a broad basis. And all the facts should be put on the table. Then even the people would agree, because they are not that stupid. The population can be educated. I am sure about that. But the leading parties must see that … populism alone on a long-term basis is not good for politics. Populism is good for elections. They can be won with populism. Sure. But populism is not a basis for serious politics, for the future and the development of this country, for peaceful coexistence and for a modern society. Populism can't do that. Look at the Brexit populists. As soon as they had to act on their promises, they threw in the towel. They are only here until they destroyed something. To build or develop things, serious politics is needed. …and today, Austria's government announced … preparations for border controls at Brenner Pass. The situation is currently being evaluated, 750 soldiers are ready. Border security measures could be activated any time, much to Italy's annoyance. Brenner Pass today, peaceful and calm. No special incidents on the Austrian-Italian border. Still, in Innsbruck … This can't be true. Pandur tanks are being moved to the military site. These tanks are equipped with special gear … for the installation of roadblocks. The Armed Forces are preparing for an increased number of refugees … who want to move from Italy to northern Europe. We will provide 750 soldiers. And we are currently delivering the appropriate equipment to Tyrol. Tyrolean head of police finds these measures exaggerated … as the number of refugees at Brenner is currently low. That's right. Pretty tragical. A chief officer is needed to correct politicians. What a disaster. Minister Doskozil gets more approval from other politicians. Tyrolean governor Platter appreciates these worst case provisions. And Sebastian Kurz needs no convincing about closing refugee routes anyway. It's important to apply pressure and send a clear message to Brussels… Here you can see the road course to the Pfitscherjoch. Wow, so that's… The mountain hut is located right at the border. Actually the border runs straight through the house. We'll hike along the southern ridge … to Pfitscherjoch Pass, which is also right at the border. We'll see the border stone there. And we will continue further down to Pfitschtal Valley. That's in South Tyrol, in Italy. As Georg said, the Landshuter hut is partially on the Austrian side. - It reaches across the border. - Exactly. Does the border still have a meaning for you today? Yes. Because we grew up here right at the Brenner. We… It's probably the same for Georg, I did not have my own passport until I was 14. It wasn't a problem, we daily went there and back. On foot. And… For me, it is still weird, going from Italy to Austria without a border control, that's still weird for me. Of course, it would also be weird, if the controls were here again. I think, the suspense got lost. I remember going to church on Sunday, and buying a shirt at Brenner Pass. I put it on, underneath my jacket, and I crossed the border very nervously, though they never stopped me, but there was a kick to it. It was action for us as teenagers. As children. Because it made you feel like a real smuggler. That atmosphere is lost today. Yes, on one hand back then … you couldn't even take a shirt across the border, or a snack, because of epidemics. If you had a snack, they took it from you. While today, everything is allowed across the border. That's the other extreme. But no controls at all, if problems amass that can't be right either. Is it true that after the war, humans were smuggled? Yes. I've heard stories that before the war, Jews were smuggled across the border. It was organised, they needed local guides who knew the terrain. They took the people and lead them across the border. And after the war, Nazis were smuggled across the border. That's what they told us, and I guess it's true. - Hello. - Hello. And that's really… That's really… The white blinds are from Club Alpino, that's Italy. The wooden blinds are in Austria. And you can see the ledge on the roof. In front, you can see the white mark, it's accurately measured. They are pedantic. When they come here they document everything. I don't know why, but they are pedantic. They control if someone took something. - So the border is an attraction? - Yes. It's also interesting for us, they have questions… It's good for our business that the border runs through our hut. Of course, you can't see it. But the guests ask where the border is. So we put up a sign in the centre of the hut. Now they know where it is and I don't have to explain it. - And one apple strudel. - Yes, please. Are the dumplings ready? Will it take long? - No, no, a little patience. - Yes. We have to rest anyway. Last time I had to wait for 45 minutes. Well, at least you could rest in the meantime. - Thank you. - Thanks. Maybe people have heard about this hut: South Tyroleans who migrated to Austria … were officially not allowed to come back. So, families and friends wrote to each other. This hut was a perfect meeting place for those … who had not seen each other for years. Because they were not allowed to cross the border. Many people crossed illegally. Across the 'green' border. No matter how many … customs officers there were. The border was still not closed. Maybe officially, on paper. But those who wanted to cross could do so. That was the time of the smugglers. They always found a way across the border. So, the smuggle route was here? Probably, yes. They would not cross the border close to the hut. The customs officers were here in summer. But they were gone as soon as it got cold. The customs officers were no serious obstacle. In Rome, they might have thought the border was closed. But it never was. I would not say that refugees are very welcome here. I never hear that. That's my feeling. The people that I talk to, they never say they are welcome. No. Rather the opposite. What do you think? - Me? - Yes. Well. I don't know, I think… I'd say I feel sorry for them. They don't have jobs anymore, nothing. But what will happen? I don't know. How could we solve the problem? That's difficult. If you ask me, we do not have a remedy for that. Josefine would give them all our food, I know her. She is like Mother Theresa, you know… But… My God, what are we supposed to say? We understand, if there is a war somewhere, and the people have no perspective. But what we don't understand is politics. That they all come at once and that it brings problems. We don't understand that. Although, no one ever did me wrong or stole my food. I have to say that. We have these jokes now, to laugh a little about it. 'The refugees are coming, let them work in the fields.' These are jokes, but no one really means it. People say, things won't come to that, and I agree. That's my opinion. Ö3 news with Inka Pieh. Italy is annoyed by preparations for border controls. Falter magazine claims a study about Islamic nurseries … was redacted by the Ministry. Ö3 news. Weather and traffic. Arrangements for border controls at Brenner alarm Italy. South Tyrol's governor Kompatscher sees Austria's … election campaign responsible for these measures. According to him, calls for border controls are old news. We noticed that there is nothing new in terms of content. The tone became a bit rougher. This might be because of Austrian elections in autumn … How did you perceive the news that Austria considers … to set up a fence or border controls here? Oh. Perceive. At first, information was covert. Or mediated in a way to keep people in the dark. That was before the Austrian election. In my opinion, it was all big words. So stupid, how can they even think of building a fence? The idea itself is so bizarre … that I thought it was never going to happen. Although I'd already heard from construction companies … that many cubic metres concrete were needed. They sensed business opportunities. But they never got it across as something serious. I thought, this is all nonsense. A stupid idea. Without any motivation to put it into practice. Building a fence does not take that long. But they don't get on with it. It's a good media campaign to incite the people. That's my opinion. Who is the one doing the inciting? If only I knew that. Looking at Europe now, it seems we moved far away … from the idea of cooperation. And inciting… I am not a politician, but I think … the right wing is strong at it. Back to your question about fear. They thrive on fear. And they will cause problems, if we don't realise in which direction we're headed. I don't like the current political landscape in Europe. Do you think the fence will ever be built? Well, no. I think, in the end, courage is lacking. And I think, politics as it is today is history. I think, the future looks different. And I have the feeling … this fence or many fences in Europe … are the last signs of life … of antiquated politics in today's Europe. That's my own personal opinion. The last splinters before it really breaks. In my opinion. Last week, a friend said to me, 'As soon as you see that you have to share, you will have success. Everything else will not work. It has always been this way.' St. Martin shared his cloak. With a poor man. It could have been a refugee. We don't know. But sharing will always be what brings us forward. I don't know, what do you think? Yes, we also had to share. When we were young, we didn't have much. For that time. It was beautiful, but we knew how we could … make something from nothing. We had to share. And this could be fun. This means: Give me something, and I'll give you something. Sharing has always been a survival strategy. This is how we can shape the future now. Sharing with them does not mean … to have less or that we have to forgo something. But we can share opportunities with the others. The opportunities we have. That's sharing. And I think we finally have to stop … to blame those who come for something that is not their fault. Because if we go back in history, we are guilty. We. We, the generation that lavishly consumes resources. Destroying things that don't belong to us. Invading other countries, and taking everything from them, livelihood, opportunities and future. Of course they flee. I would do that too. Our people also fled from here … because they had no opportunity to survive. It's always the same. I think. That's my opinion. No offence. Does our society have a moral responsibility? Every person has a moral responsibility. Not only society, every single person, every company, every club, politics, everyone. No matter when and where. We have it, and we have to take it. Also towards the refugees? Could we please avoid the word 'refugee'? They are persons who left their homes … because they can't live there anymore. When they keep throwing bombs, where should the people go? Okay, some smart ones are 'economic refugees'. I don't like the distinction, war refugee, economic refugee. Maybe also psycho refugee or terror refugee. They are people who migrate because they cannot survive. Or because they want a better future. If every single person understands that, respectfully, and the same rules apply for everyone, then it could work. It could, but it does not have to. - What are you cooking? - Pumpkin soup. I'll serve it with couscous. - Who are you cooking that for? - Well, for… For the workers at the drilling site. We communicate with a lot of gestures. We manage. They are nice people. They respect us, we respect them. The way it should be. You've been cooking for them for the past two years? Yes, in summer. They wanted to finish the work last year. That did not quite work out, they had to continue this year. The work will probably be finished this year. And yes, we will take some memory photographs. I think they had a good time here. - Will you miss them? - Yes and no. How can I put this? I'll be happy that the mess will finally be gone. Because a drilling site is always messy, and it's right at our doorstep, there is so much dirt. Well, people are coming and going. We will always remember them. We never had problems. Even though their culture is quite different. …to decide on all measures directly at Brenner. Should it really come to that, what are your specific demands from the government? Simple border controls, or do you want the border closed? We never talked about closing the border. And it is painful for a governor of Tyrol … to address a topic like that. But the security situation in Tyrol has priority. We have to protect our country. In the course of a few weeks, we would not recognise this country anymore. This is why we have to prepare, so that we… Yesterday evening was quite an experience. Actually, it was brutal, disastrous and inhumane, but also very interesting. A truck driver from Ukraine … wanted to dodge a traffic jam. His navigator led him to a nice bypass, the municipal road Nößlach. This road is of course very narrow. And it was snowing. The snow was pretty wet and slippery. And he got stuck right in front of our house. So he stood there. No English, no German, but a little Italian. So we were able to communicate. And he told us that his monthly wage was 400 euros. And … that he could not afford to eat at a restaurant. His wife cooks his food for the entire trip. And he heats it up with a gas cooker. This is the exploitation of human beings … in the twenty-first century as bondsmen. It is outrageous. But the man was happy that we gave him a meal. He was thankful for something that is normal for us. He was very happy about a simple dinner. And how did it go on? Then the police came. We had to call the police, because there is no other towing possibility. Only the police can arrange that they tow away the truck. And they came. Then, something happened that keeps happening nowadays. That police are rude to foreigners who do not understand them, and he could not understand them. I do not like this rudeness at all. Whether they are from here or foreign, white or black … or brown, this is not important. They are human beings. And they have a right to be treated as such. That is rule of law and democracy. During the conversation, we realised that the people … do not believe in the work they are doing. They don't like to do their job. It's their duty. These policemen had to come here. They were from Upper Austria. They had to come here and do a job they did not want to do. Who is good at doing a job they don't want to do? At a place where they don't want to be? A job that demands too much of a person. They were actually here … to prevent so-called illegal border crossings. That's a job that puts emotional strain on people and overwhelms them. That was pretty clear. In the end, they became more and more friendly. They also offered … to guide the man back to the motorway. And he made it back. A tow car came and they brought him back. So in the end they acted decently. But it was necessary to tell them how they should act … compliant to societal, legal and democratic rules. - Everything's here. - Good. - So this is the famous border fence? - Exactly. It's been lying here for two years. Right at the area of the Brenner border. We regularly inspect its condition. We did that just now, it's all good. And we hope that it will continue to lie here. Good. Let's close it. In 2016, Tyrolean Police caught … 11,812 'foreigners who came to Tyrol illegally'. In 2017, they caught 7,406 persons. The big rush onto Brenner Pass never happened. The construction measures have not been implemented yet.
