Really Dick. I don't know why you couldn't make an effort to get home on time for once. With the maid's day off and Philips gone down to the village for the mutton. It makes it very difficult. Mutton? What's he getting mutton for? We're going out to dinner. We're having mutton tomorrow. I don't like mutton. I don't know why you say such a silly thing. You've ate it a thousand times. A thousand times I've said I don't like it. Nonsense. What an imagination. You'll eat anything if you put your mind to it. I don't eat with my mind. I eat with my stomach. Was that supposed to be funny? - It is not. For Pete's sake what you looking for? - That bunch of green roses for my hair. It was here only yesterday. - I didn't take it. I didn't say you did. Oh, there it is. How do you like it? Not much. It's too big. That's all you know. It's very fashionable. Really Dick, you might put your things away. Just look at that bed. If I've told you once I've told you .. - A thousand times. Yet you insist on doing it. Listen, Kathryn. I don't insist on anything. What's up with you lately? You find fault with everything I do and everything I say. What's the matter with you? Don't stand there and play innocent with me. You know exactly what the matter is. What are you talking about? Your ridiculous infatuation for Evelyn. Oh. You thought I didn't know, didn't you. You must think I'm blind. The way you look at her and hang on her every word is positively nauseating. I suppose you're going to deny it? Why don't you answer me? You're in love with her, aren't you. I thought so. Well, what are you going to do about it? I'm not going to do anything about it. I haven't said anything to her and I don't intend to. When I married you your sister was just a kid. Now she's grown up, and I happen to find myself in love with her. Just one of those things that can't be helped. I suppose you'd like me to step out of the picture? Well, I'll never do that. I know that. And it's no use you trying to leave me because she'd never marry you anyway. She's too loyal. I know that too. You know Dick, it's really rather funny. This sudden burst of youthful romance. And in you of all people. I wouldn't tell Evelyn if I were you. I'm afraid she'd laugh at you too. I wish you hadn't said that. I'm not going to the party. Yes you are. It's our fifth anniversary. You wouldn't miss it for anything. You'll go and I'll go like thousands of others go. And laugh at the rest of them. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Evelyn. Come in. Are you ready yet? Are we, Kathryn? Certainly. If you two don't hurry .. You're going to be late for your silver wedding anniversary. Just a moment, Kathryn. I've got something for you. - What are you up to now? Can't you guess? Don't be impatient, my dear. All in good time. - Pick a good one, Mark. Here you are. What a beautiful rose. Isn't it, darling? - Yes, it is. Is it one you developed? - Yes. It did turn out well, didn't it. What do you call it? - I call it the "Jenny Bell". That's suspiciously romantic, doctor. Just who is Jenny Bell? The subject of the greatest mistake I ever made. That sounds serious, doctor. Come clean. Don't jump to conclusions. The mistake was mine. In not asking a very beautiful young lady to marry me. Why, doctor. I was a much younger man. I had just received my Masters. About to start teaching my first class at university. Picture me at the same age and position as young Professor Holsworth here. Like all young psychologists with brand new Masters degrees. I knew everything there was to know. But I didn't know enough to get married. And now ladies and gentlemen to the business of the evening. A toast to the happiest of couples. On their fifth anniversary. Kathryn and Richard. To the sweetest sister a girl ever had. Thank you, Evelyn. And Rick, I only hope that someday I'll find a husband as good as you. Congratulations old man. You're one of the lucky ones. - Thank you very much. I can't believe it's been five years. I assure you it doesn't seem that long. - Listen. Our favorite tune. Isn't it sweet of Dr Hamilton to have arranged all this for us. It certainly is. - I can't thank you enough, doctor. Never married myself, I have a warm spot in my heart for those that achieve it. Achieve it? - Certainly. As a psychologist, I assure you a happy marriage is indeed a rare achievement. Isn't that rather cynical? Well, perhaps it is. But you see, marriage is a very tricky business. People have impulses, compulsions. Drives, let us say. Towards escape. Escape from loneliness. They seek that escape. In the companionship of someone else. Though, just when they think they've achieved it .. They find they've put on their own handcuffs. In spite of what you say doctor, you're a very kind-hearted man. What do you say to that, Professor Holsworth? Oh, now you've got me on the spot, doctor. Professor Holsworth says .. That the thing that he admires about me is that in the pursuit of pure science. I've learned to put my heart in a cage. And is your heart in a cage, Professor Holsworth? I give it a little birdseed every now and again. That's very strong-minded of you but I'm not quite convinced. Neither am I. I regret to say Miss Turner, that pure science. Is not the only thing that the younger professors pursue. Just what kind of a doctor are you anyway? I know you mess around with the brain, but how? Well I don't do trepanning or any such vulgar hammering or sawing of the skull. I deal with thoughts and dreams which no amount of surgery can handle. You see, sometimes a thought can be like a malignant disease .. That starts to eat away at the will power. When that happens, it's my business to remove the thought. Before it can cause destruction. That's a very pretty theory doctor but I .. I don't quite see how you can take a thought out of a man's head. It seems to me if it's there it's there, and there's nothing to be done about it. Good old practical Dick. Life is so simple for engineers. All problems solved with a slide-rule and a T-square. Well, what do you eminent psychoanalysts think causes these thoughts, doctor? Any number of things. But I should say love and its frustrations is the worst offender. You see Dr Hamilton belongs to the Freudian school of psychology. It believes that love rather than money is the root of all evil. Why, it's nothing of the kind. I beg your pardon, Dr Hamilton. But love doesn't always cause unhappiness and trouble. It's man's inspiration for centuries. Why, it's been the basis of some of the greatest stories ever written. Look at Romeo and Juliet. Anthony and Cleopatra. Abelard and H?loise. Yes, but look what happened to them. Dick, that's not fair. You know what I mean. It doesn't matter what happens to people as long as they .. Have something to live for. But they didn't live for it. They died for it. Evelyn, darling. Perhaps you'd better leave the entire subject alone until you're married. Dear, I wish I could express myself better. I think you expressed yourself remarkably well. Be careful, Kathy. It's slippery. Thank you again for a wonderful evening, doctor. That's perfectly alright now. Goodbye. Do drive carefully, Dick. I am driving carefully. I think that young Professor Holsworth is awfully nice, don't you dear? I guess he'll be alright when he grows up. To hear you talk, you'd think you were a hundred and 80. As a matter of fact he's just about your own age. After all, he has a good steady job at the college. Now listen here, don't start marrying me off before I've made up my mind. When I marry, I want it to be something solid like you and Dick. Are your ears burning, Dick? Positively. By the way Evelyn, I got a letter from mother today. I gathered she was lonely and felt it was time you came home. She didn't say so in exactly so many words mind you but .. But you felt she wanted Evelyn to come home. Yes. That's funny. She didn't write me about it. She probably knew you were having a good time and didn't want to spoil your fun. I suppose I should go back, much as I hate to. Perhaps I could make plane reservations sometime next week. Look out! "Sometimes a thought can be like a malignant disease." "And start to eat away the willpower." "I suppose you would like me to step out of the picture?" "Well, I'll never do that." "Never!" "Never." "Never." "Never." "Love has been man's inspiration for centuries." "You know Dick, it's really rather funny." "I hope Evelyn never finds out." "She'd laugh at you, too." "Marriage is a very tricky business." He's alright now, doctor. Well old man, you had quite a jolt, didn't you. How do you feel? Great. It's only a broken leg. We'll have you up around again in no time. How is Evelyn? She's alright. Just a few scratches. And Kathryn? She escaped without a mark. Come in, doctor. - Thank you. Well, well. How is the patient today? - How are you, doctor? I'm fine, thanks. Doctors can't afford to be sick you know. Only rich people. Well. Now then. Let's see how we're coming along. Feel that? No. I can't feel a thing. Well, try your weight on it. Careful now. Take it easy. It's just out of use. How does it feel? Well I .. I can't feel anything. It's just like it belongs to somebody else. Well, don't worry Dick. The X-Rays show the fracture to be completely healed. If you just keep on religiously with those exercises I showed you. You'll be walking again sooner than you think. That's what I keep telling him, doctor. But for the past five weeks he's rumbled around the house like an old bear. Can you give me any idea just how long that will be? No. The trouble is mental now. Not physical. Then .. Neither you nor any other doctor can tell from that X-Ray .. Just when I'll be able to walk again, huh? Unfortunately, we can't photograph the nervous system. Your present condition is entirely neurasthenic. Neural Aphasia we call it, and that doesn't show on plates. Well, there must be something I can do. Just sitting around the house all day in a wheelchair can drive a man crazy. Well, you might try swimming in warm water. That's worked miracles in similar cases. It relaxes the muscles. Why didn't you say that, Doc? That's a great idea. Kathy, why don't we put this contraption in the car .. And go to Mountain Springs for week? Well .. - That's a splendid idea. So long as you don't over-exert yourself. Fat chance. I'll give you a letter to the house physician and ask him to look after you. Right. By the way, what do we hear from Evelyn? Yes. What do we hear from Evelyn, Kathy? As a matter of fact I got a telegram from her this morning. She says she's very happy and glad to be home. I never could quite understand why she went away so suddenly. I had an idea she was rather smitten with young professor Holsworth. I was hoping .. Goodbye. - Goodbye, doctor. Oh, Kathy. - Yes? You never said anything about .. About what? About out quarrel about Evelyn. Do you think I'm a fool? I'd rather die than tell anyone. I'm afraid I've hurt you very much, Kathy and I'm sorry. It's funny how virtuous a man can be when he's helpless. Phillips. - Yes, sir? Car ready? Putting the last two bags in now. Are you ready sir? What's the matter with you, Phillips? You seem in a bit of a hurry. Cook and I prefer to get the morning train, if it's all the same to you, sir. Oh sure, by all means. You can go along now if you want to. But what about you, Mr Mason? Mrs Mason and I will manage nicely thank you. You two run along, I know you're anxious to get started. Thank you, sir. Have a nice vacation. Thank you very much, sir. Get me Orchid 3872. Richard. Richard. - Yes? Are you nearly ready? 494. Yes. I will be right with you. Do hurry or we'll never get there. Can't you ever be on time? We were supposed to be ready an hour ago. Say Freston, I've just been looking at the core samples. But I'm not satisfied. Well, suppose you get down there and find you're tying into a fall cleavage? I can't afford to gamble on a job that far away. No, you'll have to come out to the house tonight. Yeah and take that nine o'clock train. I'm afraid there is no other way out of it. Okay, I'll see you then. Who was that? Freston. Kathy, I'm afraid we'll have to change our plans. I've got to see him tonight. Oh, drat. It can't be helped. Work is work and it's just got to be done. This sort of thing always happens when we're going away. Phillips. Phillips! Have they gone? Yes, I told them to. I wish you'd let me know before. Well, I only found it out myself just this minute. Kathy, I mustn't spoil your fun. Why not go ahead and I'll meet you up there? I'll phone Phillips .. And have him drive me out tomorrow or the day after at the very latest. But I can't drive up there alone. Certainly you can. You're an excellent driver. Have you got your key to the safe? No. I'm afraid I left mine in the bedroom. Oh, never mind. Here's mine. You're not going to take all that junk with you are you? I only want a couple of things. We're not going to the Ritz. This is just a simple mountain resort. I only wanted this cameo. It goes with the suit. You do look nice at that. That's the first compliment you've paid me in a long time. I'm not such a bad guy when you get to know me. Richard. Yes? Never mind. Oh, Kathy. - Yes? Be sure and drive slowly. Some of those mountain roads are pretty dangerous. Hello doctor. - Well, hello Kathryn. Well, how do you like the results of fertilizer on plumbago? It's lovely. Give me five minutes and I'll cut you enough for a vase full. Not now, doctor. I'm on my way to Mountain Springs. Without Richard? Something came up at the very last minute. He insisted that I go on alone. I only stopped by to ask you to look in on him and make sure he's alright. I'll be glad to. I'll clean up and go over right away. There's no need to do that. He'll be working all afternoon. Tonight too, for that matter. But if you can pop by in the morning. I will, I promise. You see. You and Evelyn are my very favorite people. Thank you, doctor. At the university I spend little time teaching classes .. And a great deal in giving advice to individuals. Distracted husbands. Unhappy wives. Sometimes I almost lose my belief. In the existence of the happy marriage. Then I think .. of yours. We've been fortunate. More than anyone expected five years ago my dear. I guess it's quite safe to tell you now I wouldn't have bet an old umbrella .. On your marriage lasting as much as a year. It's really a great tribute to you to have proved me so utterly wrong. Have a wonderful time at Mountain Springs, my dear. Don't worry about Richard. I'll look after him. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor. Goodbye. - Goodbye. [ Car's horn ] Would you mind moving your car? Kathryn. Richard? Richard. I was so afraid, I thought .. Why, you're walking, Richard. You're walking without help. How did you get here? Why are you here, Richard? Why are you here? No. Richard. Don't. Thank you. Doesn't seem to by anybody home. Is that you Freston? Yes. Where are you? In the study. Come on in. Hello Bob. - Hi, Mason. I meant to leave the porch light on for you. Hello. Mountain Springs hotel? I'll wait. Too bad I had to break into your vacation this way, Philips. But I'll make it up to you later on. That's alright, sir. I quite understand. Just a minute. Hello. Mountain Springs hotel? I want to speak with Mrs Richard Mason. I'm sorry I had to drag you down here on a night like this. That's okay. - Make yourself comfortable. Thanks. Hello? Yes. She hasn't? Are you sure? Well .. have her call me the minute she comes in, will you. Thank you very much. She should have been there by now. Phillips, do you suppose you can get us some food? Yes, sir. I think there is some nice cold mutton in the icebox. Mutton, but I .. Yes. That would be alright. Let's get to work. This is plate 47. Are you absolutely certain she hasn't arrived yet? Are you the chap I talked to before? Uhuh. Be sure to have her call me the minute she gets in. It's important. Bob, I'm really getting worried. - Now don't get yourself all worked up. She may have had engine trouble or a flat tire or something. If she'd had any difficulty she'd certainly have let me know. She may have had trouble getting to a phone. After all, the mountain roads .. What did I tell you? There she is now. - Hello? Hello Dick. This is Hamilton. Kathryn stopped by on her way up to the Springs and asked me to look after you. I'm keeping my word. How are you? Frankly doctor, I'm a little worried. She hasn't arrived and it's getting late. I say, that is something to worry about. She came by here shortly before noon. "If you don't hear from her soon Dick I should inform the Highway Patrol." Yes. I guess I'd better do that right away. Thanks for calling, doctor. Bob, I don't think I can do any more work tonight. This thing is really getting on my nerves. Have we about finished? There is just the design for the causeway center. Hello? Hello. Get me Police Headquarters. Where did you get this idea? Howard recommends the pentacle pattern for loose shale. Yeah. Yes. That ought to do very well. Hello? Police Headquarters? I want to report a missing woman. Yes. Thank you. Now, Dr Hamilton. You say Mrs Mason stopped by your house for a moment on her way out of town. How long did she stay? Only for a few minutes. She didn't come into the house. She said that you Richard were all alone. She asked me to look in on you. I offered to do so at once but she said you had work to do. And this morning would be soon enough. Did she seem to be any different from usual? Was she .. Excited or morose or anything like that? - No. I would say she was in normally good spirits. Thank you, doctor. Mr Mason. You say she was wearing a green cameo ring? That's right. Did she have any other jewellery with her? Yes. She had one of those costume pieces on her coat. And .. a wedding ring. An engagement ring. Oh yes. A heart-shaped gold locket engraved "Richard to Kathryn". She kept my picture in it. Do you remember anything else? Yes. A monogrammed handkerchief in her pocket. A white handkerchief? - Yes. With a green border. And, let's see. I'm trying to visualise as I last saw her. She was wearing a rose. She looked very smart. I remember and commented on it. You've done excellently, Mr Mason. If you knew what we usually have to work on. Highway Patrol, sir. - Come in, Roberts. Find anything? - No, sir. No sign of a crack-up or skid marks of any kind. Of course, last night's rain didn't help any. Mr Mason. Are you sure which road Mrs Mason took to Mountain Springs? Pretty sure. Martinez Canyon. We usually go up that way. Couldn't she have via Allison Highway and then cut over to Martinez canyon? No, I hardly think so. It's several miles longer that way. We've combed both roads all the way to Mountain Springs and back. Alright, Roberts. You may go. - Thank you. I don't understand this, Workman. There are only two roads. A woman and a car can't vanish into thin air. Mr Mason, I'm going to say something that may offend you. I hope you realize my position. There can be only two explanations of what happened. Either your wife's car skidded off into a canyon that we've yet to search. Or she didn't go where she said she was going. Exactly what do you mean? Well, if you'd had a quarrel, say. She might have gotten mad and gone off to visit a friend without telling you. No, I hardly think there's any chance of that. My wife and I got on very well together. Nevertheless, women are sometimes very unpredictable. She might have been nursing some secret sorrow or grudge. Of which you were unaware. Isn't there some intimate friend or relative of hers we could question? Richard, I hope you won't mind my making a suggestion. Don't you think we should send for Evelyn? I already have. Dick. I believe you're playing on my sympathy. You can do better than that. I thought I was doing pretty well .. For a guy who has only been out of his perambulator a couple of days. Of course you are. Dr Grant will be very pleased. Not half as pleased as I will be to see the last of Dr Grant and this. I've admired you so much this past week. I know what a terrific strain you've been under, yet you've been wonderful. It's such a help to me. You've been a great help to me just by being here. Dick, I .. I am going to ask you a question I've wanted to ask for some time. Go ahead. Shoot. Did you notice anything unusual about Kathryn before she disappeared? What do you mean? Before I left, I .. I felt there was something worrying her. Something she was trying to hide. Yes, well. Now that you mention it I may as well tell you I felt the same thing. I guess I should have told you before. Perhaps if I had this wouldn't have happened. She had been acting strangely for some time. She even started imagining things. - What sort of things? I don't think there is any reason to go into them. Just the results of an overwrought condition. No, Dick. I think I have a right to know. Well .. for one thing. She imagined I'd fallen in love with you. With me? Yes. Where on earth did you get that idea? I don't know. May I come in? Of course, doctor. We've been expecting you. I was just admiring your roses. Go around to the front door or maybe put a beard on and come down the chimney. I guess I'm too old for that sort of thing. Funny things happen inside people's heads, don't they? Dick. Please don't say anything about this to anyone. For Kathryn's sake. I won't. Good evening, Dr Hamilton. - Good evening, Phillips. I didn't hear you drive up, sir. - Oh, I left the car at home. It was such a beautiful evening I thought the walk would do me good. Hello doctor. How are you? Fine, Dick. It's good to see you up and around again. Hello Evelyn. - Good evening, doctor. I hope I'm not late. - Not at all. How about a cocktail? - Excellent idea. [ Telephone ] Yes? Yes, this is Mr Mason. What? Alright. I'll be right over. Sorry, doctor. I'm afraid we'll have to postpone dinner for a while. That was Police Headquarters. They've found a clue. It may be the end of our waiting. Well, this is what we found on him, Mr Mason. Recognise it? Yes. It is Kathryn's or an exact duplicate. What do you say, Miss Turner? It is Kathryn's ring. You're sure? - Positive. Hey, you. Take your hat off. Where did you get that ring? Out of a lady's pocketbook. You snatched the pocketbook? No. Just stuck in my hand and come out with it. Come on, make it clearer. What happened? Well, we was waiting to cross the street, see. A big crowd, see. A red light was holding us up. - This was in downtown traffic? Yeah. That's right. - When? A couple of days ago. - Go ahead. Well, this lady is standing right next to me, see. I guess the people next to her must have been pushing or something. Because she changes the pocketbook to her hand right along the side of me. Well, I .. unlatched the bag. Stick my hand in and come out with the ring. Remember what the lady looked like? Nah. That's all. Just a minute. Mind if I ask him a question? - No. Go ahead. Was this lady wearing a hat? Yes, sir. What color was it? Was it green? - I think so. Just a plain hat. Nothing on it? Nothing. Yeah. Yeah, there was one thing on it. What? - A feather. Kind of a big feather. You're lying. You either kidnapped her or killed her. Don't just stand there staring at me! Do something! Make him say where she is. Beat it out of him. Take him out. - Come on, let's go. Sorry I blew up. It's the strain of waiting. Not knowing what's happened to her. Come on, Evelyn. I think that man knows a lot more than he's admitting. If he does, you may be sure they'll get it out of him. Just a matter of time. Meanwhile Richard, I would like to offer a suggestion. Go ahead. Get away from all this for a while. Get out of the house. Too many associations. Too hard on the nerves. - My nerves are alright. Are they? How do you expect me to feel? I say that you do and it is time to do something about it. I'm leaving tomorrow for Rainbow Lake to spend my spring vacation. Why not come up there with me? Strong service at the lodge. Lakes, mountains and good fishing. It will do you good. I think you should go, Dick. It is exactly what you need. How about you? You've been under just as much strain as I have. Why don't you come along too? I'd like to if Dr Hamilton doesn't mind. Mind? I'd be delighted. Let's consider the matter settled then, huh. Goodnight, Dick. I'm glad you decided to come with me. So am I. I think it will do us both good. I'm afraid I'm depending a good deal on you. I like to be depended on. Goodnight. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Yes, sir? Has anyone been in this room tonight? No-one except myself, sir. Someone else has. Someone wearing Mrs Mason's perfume. Can't you smell it? Yes. I think I can, sir. But I don't understand it, unless Miss Evelyn ..? No, it couldn't have been Miss Evelyn. She's been out with me all evening. That will be all. Can I assist you, sir? No. I'll manage alright. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight. Get me Police Headquarters. I want to talk to Lieutenant Egan. This is Richard Mason. Hello, Egan? This is Mason. Somebody has been in my house tonight. No. Nothing has been taken. Something has been added. The wedding ring my wife wore when she went away. You know Dick, it's like a different world up here. It makes everything that happened back home seem like a bad dream. Yeah, I know. Ship ahoy! Hiya, Doc. - Hello. - Any luck? Well, if you call this luck. I could use that for bait. I caught one bigger but didn't like the way he looked at me so I threw him back. I don't really fish for fish anyway. I just like it as an excuse to do nothing. Same time in the morning, doctor? - Same time, Bill. Say, you two should come out where there really are fish. Hey, you did alright. I know what we're having for dinner. Did you have a good day, doctor? - Fine. Look. No Evelyn, go this way. The boatman says it's shorter. It must be a little dull for you, my dear. To be up here with two old fogeys like Dick and me. Speak for yourself, doctor. I'm neither old nor a fogey, whatever that is. Nevertheless I thought Evelyn needed the companionship of someone her own age. So when we get back to the hotel I'm hoping she finds an agreeable surprise. Who? Professor Holsworth. Really doctor, you shouldn't have done that. What will they think? Put your mind at ease, my dear. Professor Holsworth is under the impression .. That I wish to consult him with regard to our work for the next semester. You're quite a matchmaker, doctor. Why not let the girl make up her own mind? Don't worry, Dick. I will. Well, there you are. I try to play cupid and that's all the thanks I get. What's that? Oh, that woodpile? - Yeah. That's for the outdoor bonfire. They make a nice looking couple, don't they? What? I said: "they make a nice looking couple, don't they". Yes, I suppose they do. I hadn't really thought about it. Young Holsworth has a brilliant career ahead of him if he watches his step. And I think Evelyn is the girl to see that he does just that. A long distance call for you, sir. - I'll be right there. It's probably Egan. Maybe he's got something out of that hobo? Yes, I've been waiting for him to crack. What would you say to a walk on the terrace? I'd prefer that if you're sure you don't mind. No. Come along. One moment please. You can take it in the second booth. Hello? Hello. Hello, hello? What is the matter with the call, operator? - I don't know sir. Hello? Hello? The line must be disconnected now. The party didn't even answer. Give me the city, Main 2020. Yes, sir. Main. 2-0-2-0 One moment please. Hello. Police Headquarters? The Homicide Bureau. Homicide. Workman speaking. Just a minute. Hey, Egan. Egan. Yeah? Richard Mason for you. Egan speaking. Hello, Mr Mason. No. No, I didn't call you. "We've got nothing to report right now." I'll let you know if anything happens. Okay. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Goodbye. Did the party who called give his name? - It was a lady, sir. A lady? - Yes, sir. Did the lady give her name? No. No, I thought that .. No, I'm sure she didn't give her name, sir. Just what did she say? If you'll excuse me, sir. I've read about you and your wife in the papers. Uhuh. This lady said: "I'd like to speak to Mr Mason". And I said, who's calling please? And I thought she said "Mrs Mason". She probably just repeated "Mr Mason". The connection wasn't a clear one. Is there any way to have the call traced? I'm afraid not, sir. I'm certain I heard her incorrectly. Yes, I guess it must have been a mistake. Rainbow Lodge. One moment please. More news, Dick? I don't know. By the time I got there the phone was disconnected. Well, if it's important they'll call back. I guess so. Doctor, you're a pretty smart man. You've had a lot of experience along these lines. What do you think about that hobo? Do you think he told us all he knows? - Yes, I think he was telling the truth. He is just a common or garden variety of pickpocket. You see Dick, it takes a man of violent mind .. To commit a major crime like robbery or killing. Then you believe that all killers are one particular pattern, eh? All those who commit premeditated murder are egotists to the point of egomania. A pretty broad statement. But based on an obvious premise I'm afraid. Only a supreme egotist who holds his desires over the life of another person. Would feel capable of achieving the perfect crime. That's open to argument, doctor. Since there have been unsolved murders there could have been perfect crimes. The laws of chance are overwhelmingly against it. And so are the laws of human nature. You see, a murderer's whole safety depends on a complication of lies. That he had not motive, no access. That his alibi is perfect. Even if he feels no remorse. Think of the strain he endures knowing that one error would be his undoing. That if he is forgetful enough to contradict one of his statements. If his act of innocence is unconvincing in any detail. If he so much as talks in his sleep. I wonder what's become of Evelyn. You know, that's probably the same moon they have back home. It looks better here somehow. - It is beautiful. Evelyn. Ever since you came back there's something I've wanted to ask you. It's been on my mind ever since you went away. In fact I didn't realise how much I wanted you here. Until you did go away. If you know what I mean. Yes Norman, I believe I know what you mean. I've been thinking. Although I'm pretty well set with my teaching at college. I have no background. No home life, if you know what I mean. I know this is all very sudden. No, Norman. I've had the feeling that you liked me for quite some time but I .. Don't you like me? - Yes. Yes, I do. What's the matter? Is there some other man? - No, of course not. Who would there be? I don't know. You say you like me, but .. Norman, please don't ask me to give you an answer right now. I'm so confused. I'd like to give you a reason but I can't. I can't explain it. Aren't you cold out here? Maybe I'd better get you a wrap? I'm alright, Dick. Nevertheless, I think you should have a wrap. I'll get it. He seems to be very fond of you. Yes. In fact he just asked me to marry him. Oh. What did you say? I told him I couldn't make up my mind just now. Why did you say that? Because it's true. Why is it true? Why couldn't you make up your mind? I don't know, Dick. I just couldn't give him an answer. That's all. I'll tell you why. Because you feel about me just as I feel about you. That's not true. - It is true. It's always been true. How do you feel about me? What do you mean, Dick? - Here is your wrap, Evelyn. How about us all walking down to the camp fire by the lake? No. Count me out. What's the matter with him? I don't know. I have to find out. Will you excuse me please, Norman? Sure. Dick? Dick? I want to talk to you a minute. Alright. Go ahead. What is it? What did you mean just now when you said: "I feel the same way about you as you do about me." You know perfectly well what I meant. I love you. You shouldn't have said that. Even if it is true. Why shouldn't I have said it? I am past pretending either to myself or to anybody else. Kathryn was right then. Yes. Kathryn was right. Did you tell her you were in love with me? No, but she seemed to sense it in some way. I sensed it too. It made me very uncomfortable at times. The situation became impossible. That's really why I went away. And now? It's still impossible, Dick. Why? Why is it impossible? Because we don't know what's happened to her. Don't know if she's dead or alive. I'm not talking about her. I'm talking about us. How do you feel about us? But it could never be, Dick. She'd always be there between us. Then you do love me? - I didn't say that. It's what you meant, isn't it? You love me but haven't the courage to face it. No Dick, I don't love you. - So why did you come back? What do you mean? - What I said. Why did you return when you heard Kathryn was gone? Because I worry for her. I had to come in case I could do anything. You came as you wanted to be with me. - Yes, but .. Kathryn was gone so you could be alone with me. You sent for me. Why did you come tonight? Why are you here now? I had to know what you meant downstairs. You know well what I meant downstairs. There was nothing very subtle about it. If you'd not wanted to hear more you'd have gone with Holsworth. But I wanted to have it out in the open. I had to discuss it with you. Alright. We are discussing it. What would you do if Kathryn came back now? I don't know. - See. You'd prattle on about Romeo and Juliet .. And all those romantic story characters who died for the love you run away from. But I don't feel that way about you. - But you do. - No. That's why you came back. That's why you couldn't answer that professor of yours. That's why you sit here now. You just haven't the courage to say it. Dick, stop it! Better dry your eyes. It is Kathryn's. That's what I meant when I said .. She would always be here. Between us. Are you sure that this is the identical handkerchief she wore when she went off? Of course I'm sure. Otherwise I wouldn't have brought it to you. I even asked her maid at the house. She said she distinctly remembers she put it in the pocket of my wife's suit. If fact, it was made for the suit. There was no other like it. Mr Mason. I've come across a lot of screwy things in this business. But this beats them all. Now look, Egan. The ring, the key and the handkerchief can mean one of two things. Either she was murdered and her body has been found, or she was kidnapped. If it's a ransom they want, I'll pay it. Have you received any anonymous letters? Not so far. I bet that to start any minute. What about that tramp you caught? What have you done with him? - We're still holding him. On a pickpocket charge. I'd like to get my hands on him for five minutes. I'd make him talk. Sorry, Mr Mason but .. That's absolutely against regulations. Regulations? I imagine it's also against regulations .. For you to sit on your fine, upholstered plush-bottom swivel-backed chair. Taking the taxpayers money without delivering the goods. I warn you, Egan. Unless I get some decisive action out of this office. I'm going to hire my own detectives. Good morning, Mr Mason. - How are you, Miss Crowley. Tell Mr Harris I'd like to see him. - Yes, sir. Welcome back, Mr Mason. We didn't expect you so soon. Oh yes. Well, I just happened to be in town for a few hours. I thought I'd drop in and see if everything in alright. Any news? - No, sir. Mr Clayborne and I opened the business mail as you directed. We've attended to everything. Those that seemed personal, we were going to forward them to you, but .. That's alright. Yes, I knew Freston was going to run into trouble. Were you able to send him the parts? - Yes. Went out on yesterday's clipper. Mr Mason. Several. All of us. Have been wondering whether you have had any news of Mrs Mason. No. Not yet. We are very sorry, sir. If there is anything at all that we can do .. Thanks. Yes, sir. [ Music. Loud. ] Wait for me. - Yes, sir. Is this your ticket? Yep. You want to redeem it? - Yes. 2-2-7-8-7. 2-2-7-8-7. 2-2-7-8-7. 2-2-7-8-7. Who pawned this locket? - Didn't you? No. Who did? A lady. Mrs Richard Mason. Let me see that book. When was this? How long ago? - Right. The day before yesterday. Remember her? What did she look like? Yeah, I remember. Kind of a nice looking lady. Sort of tall .. Wore a green outfit. One of them suits. You know. Everything green. Her handbag, her suit, her hat. All but a feather sticking up, sort of. The day before yesterday? - Yep. How to redeem it? How much? Nothing doing. Come back in 90 days and you can buy it. What do you mean? A new state law. Only the party that pawned the stuff can redeem it. Yeah, but I have the pawn ticket. - That's only half of it. You got to duplicate the signature or get a letter off the lady who pawned it. I'm her husband, Richard Mason. I've all sorts of identification in my wallet. It's no good, mister. Not unless you got a letter from her to me. Of course, if she don't show up for 90 days, it goes on sale. 90 days? Thank you. Hey. Hey .. sweetheart. Remember me? Yeah. How much do I owe you? - A dollar .75. A dollar .75. Well, drive me to Police Headquarters. Are you sure the book was signed Mrs Richard Mason? I'm positive. - It doesn't seem possible. It's impossible that her wedding ring would turn up in my safe but it did. What's the address? - 17 Bay Street. 17 Bay Street. Thank you very much. Yes, gentlemen? We want to see the gold locket Mrs Mason pawned. Gold locket? I think there must be some mistake, mister. I have no gold lockets. Nobody buys them anymore. The few I had left I sold just for the gold. Don't give me that. It was right here in this tray half an hour ago. You must have seen it in another pawnshop, sir. No, it was right here in this pawnshop. - Let's see that locket. Honestly, gentlemen. I haven't had any gold lockets in here for over a year. Where is your partner? - I have no partner. How about your clerk, your helper? The big fellow? He is making a mistake, mister detective. I have no partner. Or help of any kind. This is my shop. I run it myself. You sure this is the place? - Absolutely positive. I remember those clocks, the guitar, the whole place. It was right here in this case. Number 22787. Have you got the ticket? - Yes. No. He kept it. The big fellow. Believe me, Mr Detective .. - Hand me that ledger. Yes, sir. Anything you say. I'll show it to you right there in the book in her own handwriting. Let's see. 22787. 22787 - 22 .. You've switched books! You've hidden the locket. Where is it? Get a hold of yourself. That won't do any good. Come on. Let's get out of here. Of course, it's possible you're mistaken about the pawnshop. They're all similar. I tell you I'm not mistaken. It was that pawnshop at that address. 17 Bay Street. I walked into the shop. I gave the ticket to the man behind the counter. He handed me the locket. I kept it and held it in my hand. I saw my wife's signature in the book alongside the number. The same number that was on the pawn ticket: 22787. If we only had the ticket. - I said he kept it. The big fellow. No reason to get excited, Mr Mason. - No reason? How would you feel if all this had happened to you? Well, I .. guess I'd feel as if I'd gone soft in the head. No look here, Workman. We've had half a dozen clues and nobody seems able to do anything about them. I warned Egan that unless something was done and quickly .. I must take matters into my own hands. That's exactly what I am going to do. Well Professor, what do you think? Are they written by the same person? Apparently, yes. But it's possible that some similarities that appear now may be the result .. Of some family characteristics occurring in the writings of brothers and sisters. Are such cases common? No. But you do run across them now and then. But for a positively accurate comparison. I shall have to enlarge both specimens. Analyse the individual letters. And study the basic angles and group couples. I am sorry to have to put you to all that trouble professor. Not at all. I'm only too delighted to do all I can for a friend of Dr Hamilton's. And he'll enjoy every minute of it. Give Professor Berens a comparison microscope .. And he's as happy as a little boy playing Sherlock Holmes. Well I only hope I can be of some help to you. Thank you. Oh, Richard. Are you going to leave Evelyn up at the lodge? Yes. I don't see any need in dragging her down here for all this. Good. As long as she is with professor Holsworth. You can be sure she's in good hands. Mr Mason, I didn't hear you come in. That's alright, Philips. I thought you were still up at Rainbow Lodge. Well I had some unexpected business here in town. Say. Mrs Mason used to keep her stationary here in this desk. Yes, sir. Whatever became of it? Do you know? Miss Evelyn took it, sir. Oh. Miss Evelyn. Yes, sir. When she went up to the lodge. Sisters have a way of borrowing each other's things, sir. I should know. My wife has two of them. And that reminds me, sir. Do you remember the night we smelt the perfume? I found that Miss Evelyn had a bottle, just like her sister's. Well goodnight, Phillips. Shall I turn your bed down, sir? No. I'm driving back to the lodge. Who is it? Dick. May I come in? - Yes. The clerk downstairs tells me you're leaving. Yes. Where are you going? Back to town. - Why? I've decided I can't stay up here any longer after last night. You were going without telling me? I've written you a note. It's there on the desk. What's the matter, Dick? I'm just thinking how much your stationary looks like Kathryn's. Oh. It is Kathryn's. I didn't bring any with me when I left home so I borrowed hers. I didn't think you'd mind. Strange. - What? How closely your handwriting resembles hers. Oh? I hadn't noticed that. Yes. It would only take a few strokes of the pen to make them totally identical. What's wrong, Dick? Is there something wrong? - Yes, you seem to be .. Why are you looking at me like that? Odd. I was just about to ask you the same thing. Why do you look at me as you do? You're imagining things. - Am I? [ Telephone ] I'll answer that. Hello? What? Miss Turner's car? Oh, well cancel it. Yes. I'll drive Miss Turner to the station. Send a boy for the rest of the luggage. - You shouldn't have done that, Dick. Why not? I might as well drive you down as long as I'm here. But you must be tired. It's a hard drive, especially at night. I like driving at night. Come on, we'd better hurry. Just put it in the back. - Yes, sir. Here you are. - Thank you, sir. Do drive carefully, Dick. These mountain roads are so dangerous. Yes. I've heard that before. Mr Mason. Mr Mason! You're wanted on the telephone. You're wanted on the telephone. Wait for me. Hello? Hello, Dick. I tried to get you at home. Phillips told me you'd gone to the lodge. Yes, well I changed my plans. What is the verdict? What did Berens find out? "It's the same handwriting, Richard." "It is Kathryn's writing." It couldn't be. There is no doubt about it. Professor Berens says he'd stake his reputation on it. What does that mean? "I don't know. I think it means that Kathryn is still alive." "Dick?" "Dick?" Are you still there, Dick? "Are you still there, Dick?" Well. Thanks for calling. Holsworth. Holsworth! Hello, Mr Mason. Sorry I didn't see you. I don't know whether I'm coming or going. Did you ever tell a girl that you loved her and were given your walking papers? I don't know. I guess so, I can't remember. Probably not. From what I've seen of you, you'd be good with women. What did Evelyn say to you? She was very nice. She wanted me to be her friend. Evelyn is the only girl I've had for a friend. It's amazing how much I love her. I love her so much it's unbelievable that she doesn't love me. I think I know what you mean. I said goodbye to her. I'm going back tomorrow. I wouldn't do that. If I were you I'd have another try. I think you'll find she's changed her mind. Where is she? Outside in my car. Oh, Holsworth. You are a nice fellow. It works both ways, Mr Mason. Good luck. - Thanks. I'm sure you'll appreciate the splendid construction of this, sir. It's twice as strong as the average wardrobe case. But only a fraction of the weight. Yes, I'll take it. How about a smaller one? - Yes, sir. I believe I've an excellent one in the same matched set. It needn't match. Anything will do. But I'm sure you'll like this one sir if I can only lay my hands on it. I saw it here somewhere. Oh, here it is. Right here. - Yes, that will do. Yes, sir. I knew you'd like it. You know, I always think it is much better to have luggage that matches. Anything wrong, sir? Hey you! Kathryn. Are you looking for someone, mister? Yes. I want to see the lady who lives here. You got the wrong flat. No-one lives in there. It's for rent. Are you the manager of this building? No, I'm the owner. Oh. Well. May I see this flat? Why, yes. You'll find it a real nice flat, mister. I just had it all done over with new wallpaper. The floor is all redone. It's a nice light flat and real handy to the market and shopping center. This is a studio if you paint. That's practically a new stove I got there. I put it in for the last tenant. Double drain-board sink and plenty of cupboard space. That's a closet. Where does that door lead to? - The fire-escape. Is it always kept locked? Yes. - Where's the key? I have it. I never leave keys in locks. There is a trick some people have of pushing them out. And then fishing them through the crack under the door. Where is she? - Who? The woman who just came in here. There was no woman came in here. I saw my wife come in here just now. Unless you tell me where she is I'll call the police. Please mister, this is a respectable apartment. She's supposed to be dead. Understand? She's supposed to be murdered. Murdered? - Yes, murdered. You know what that means? You don't like that do you. - No, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Cats come back sometimes but women don't. Put cats in a bag, throw 'em in a river. Sometimes they get out and come back. Even if they do come back you're not supposed to harbor them. It's against the law. It's against the housing law. Yes, sir. Especially a person who has been murdered. Help! The doctor will be with you in a few moments, Mr Mason. Thank you. Well, Richard. I didn't expect you back so soon. Busy? Oh no. I'm not expecting my first patient for half an hour. What can I do for you? Well, I hardly know how to begin. Just a moment, Richard. Are you about to consult me professionally or as a friend? Both, I guess. I'm sorry, but that's impossible. You see the proper application of pure science .. Admits of no such human frailties as friendship. One cannot continue to treat human suffering efficiently. One must also be forced to share it. Alright. Then consider this visit any way you please but .. I need help. Really, Richard? That's an unusual admission coming from you. You've always seemed so efficient, so self-reliant. So, shall we say, clever. What do you mean by that? Just making a simple statement of fact. If you're beginning to doubt yourself it must be a thing of a serious nature. Doctor. I don't believe in ghosts and I don't believe in the supernatural. I don't believe that people live on in life after they've left it. But I saw Kathryn today or someone who looked like her. Where? Downtown. She passed me in the street. I followed her but couldn't catch her on account of this leg. She disappeared into an empty house. How do you know it wasn't Kathryn? But it couldn't be. - Why couldn't it? Well if it was, why didn't she stop when I called her? Why didn't she speak to me? She may be a victim of amnesia. I've thought of that possibility for some time. I've been hoping she might be picked up .. And identified. Some card or letter in her purse perhaps. Whereby she could be returned to us. Then if that was true she couldn't have left the key and the ring at the house. In a sleepwalking state she may have returned them. A subconscious state to renounce her marriage, perhaps? Yes, but the phone call? It could have been a mistake on the part of the operator. What about the handkerchief? - An accident. Laundry often gets mixed. The pawn ticket. The locket? She would need money, Richard. It would be the natural thing to do. Doctor, these things may seem natural to you but they seem unnatural to me. You sit there complacently droning on, trying to give logical explanations. Trying to make me think I'm crazy. I'm not trying to make you think you're crazy, Richard. Then what are you doing? I'm just trying to understand you. Is something else troubling you, Richard? Something you ought to tell me? I haven't anything to say I haven't already said. Then why don't you accept my explanation? Why do you go on torturing yourself with these doubts? I don't know what you mean by doubts. What is there to doubt? I don't know. That's what I'm asking. What are you getting at? Nothing apparently. I want to recall to you Richard something I said at the party. Evelyn asked me exactly what I did as a doctor. I replied that sometimes a thought can be like a malignant disease. And it was my business to remove these thoughts before they cause destruction. You have refused to give me your confidence. Therefore, I am helpless. Nobody can help you now Richard except yourself. Whatever is troubling you must be faced by you. Whatever doubts may haunt you. Can be laid to rest by you and you alone. Then. You can't help me. No, I'm afraid I can't. Doctor. You've a lot of experience with mental cases, assuming that I am a mental case. Ever run across anything like this before? Only once. Many years ago when I was a student in Vienna. What was that? - A man who murdered his wife. Oh, Richard. You've forgotten your hat. She's not there, Dick. Come on out, Mason. Don't try to get away. It's no use. You had better go. Where is Kathryn? Where is she? We took her body away the day after you killed her. But I saw her today. That was a policewoman impersonating your wife. Then she really was dead all the time. Yes. What are you doing here? What have you got to do with all this? I caught the one slip you made. The rose. You said Kathryn was wearing it the last time you saw her. She was. It was pinned to her coat. I gave her that rose when stopped at my house. A rose you couldn't have seen when you were meant to be helpless sat at home. Come on. Then I haven't been imagining things all these weeks? You staged them? Yes, Dick. The police had no evidence that would convince any jury. We had to drive you back here. We had help, of course. The handwriting expert. The hobo. The man in the pawnshop. But most of all, your consc?ence. Evelyn. Was she helping you? - No, she knew noth?ng about it. I hoped she didn't. Well, it's all over. This is the end, doctor. * steve d *
