You must realise, baroness Lehzen as her governess, that the Princess must be made to consider the impropriety of criticising one of her instructors. Did you hear, Victoria? Yes, mama. Should the duchess of Northumberland again have occasion to tell you that there is no royal road to learning, you will not answer as you did that that is the only road you will take. - No, mama. - No. Tomorrow morning, baroness Lehzen will awaken you at seven. At eight she will breakfast with you, at nine she will take you a brief walk in the gardens, and with no unseemly romping. No, mama. Oh, and Victoria, I do not wish you to walk down the main stairway alone again, not ever, under any circumstances. Did you hear? Victoria, are you asleep? Yes, mama. Victoria! What an outcome, Canterbury. What an outcome. Europe upon the verge of war, england on the verge of revolution, and a girl on the throne. An unknown girl of 18. With no will of her own. Why do you say that? How can she have? Under the thumb of Leopold of Belgium - and stockmar of Germany. - Yes. And all the character knocked out of her by that German mother of hers. Poor aldington. Where are we? Kensington village. The dawn's beautiful here after what a night. It promises a glorious day. And tomorrow the proclamation. One the 2ist of June, the longest day in the year. Perhaps an omen. An omen? The dawn of a glorious reign and the longest. Dreamer. - William? - We wish to see the Princess Victoria. Marie, Princess Victoria. Draw the blinds. You may go. The Princess is in such a sweet sleep, I couldn't disturb her. Baroness Lehzen would be angry. Then be good enough to tell the baroness Lehzen that the lord Chamberlain wishes to see her immediately. The Princess is asleep. She sending for Lehzen. My lords, you sent for me? Baroness Lehzen, will you have the Princess Victoria informed that we desire an audience on a business of urgent importance? Leopold of Belgium, stockmar of Germany, Lehzen of Germany. Victoria. Lehzen! What is it? The archbishop of Canterbury and lord conyngham asked for the Princess. I will go. Get my shawl. We must see her alone, conyngham. That will mean a scene with the mother. Nevertheless, we must face it. My daughter is asleep. We come on business of state and even her sleep must give way to that. My lords, your coming at such an hour tells me what that business is. There is nothing that you have to say to her that you cannot say better to me. Ma'am, that is not so. No so? You forget that I am the queen mother? Not so, again, ma'am. You are the mother of the queen. There is a difference. And it is to the queen alone that we have messages. Alone. I will have her sent for. Lehzen, inform my daughter. I shall remain in the adjoining room, ready immediately I am wanted. Your majesty. Your majesty. We have been sent to bring you the sad news that your uncle, the king, is dead. By the death of our late sovereign of happy memory, become our only lawful and rightful liege, lady Victoria. By the grace of god, queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, defender of the faith, saving as aforesaid. To whom, saving as aforesaid, we do acknowledge all faith and constant obedience with all happy and humble affection, beseeching god by whom kings and queens do reign, to bless the royal Princess Victoria with long and happy years to reign over us. God save the queen! Lehzen. Baron of sockmar. And now, Victoria, the next thing is a privy council. At any moment, the prime minister will be here. Before he comes, baron stockmar has a word to say to you. You will give him your dutiful attention. Remember, anything he has to say is as from your uncle Leopold. His majesty, the kind of the Belgians, has charged me with the task of helping and advising you. When the prime minister lord Melbourne comes to you, you should tell him that it is your intention to retain him and the rest of the ministry at the head of affairs. Say no more than that. Your majesty, the prime minister. Let him come to me. I shall see him alone. Alone? Quite alone, as I shall always all my ministers. - My dear child. - If the queen so wishes, I see no harm. Well, for this once. When the privy council is ready, have me informed. Remember, you retain him and his ministry at the head of affairs. M'lord, it is my intention to retain you and the rest of the ministry at the head of affairs. I thank you, majesty. I hope I may do well. I have no doubt, ma'am. That gives me courage. We must make certain that neither Melbourne or any of his ministers outweigh the influence of Leopold. Have no fear. By your leave, my men will return to the council. If you will join us in a few moments? Lord Melbourne, I shall value your help and advice in all things, always. It will be my endeavour, with remains to me of life, to be worthy of such trust. Lo. Baron stockmar, have you any further instructions to give my daughter before we go into the council chamber? None. Mama, I think lord Melbourne intended that I should go into the council alone. Alone? What has come over you, Victoria? And mama, am I really and truly queen? Yes, my dear, it is so. You have just seen. The Lehzen, pray give instructions to have my bed removed from mama's room. From my room? To take yourself from me? Yes, mama. From tonight I wish to sleep in my own room. As I here present to you, queen Victoria, the undoubted queen of this realm, wherefore all you who have come this day to do your homage, are you willing to do the same? Long reign queen Victoria. As I here present unto you, queen Victoria, the undoubted queen of this realm, wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage, are you willing to do the same? Long reign queen Victoria. And will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the respective laws and customs of the same? I solemnly promise so to do. The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep, so help me god. Encourage thy matron to serve us in mercy and loving kindness. Look down upon this, thy servant Victoria, our queen, who now in lo humility boweth her head to thy divine majesty. Amen. Victoria! Victoria! Vivat Victoria Regina! > The queen shall live long > the queen > shall live long Your majesty, are you still resting? No, miss, but I am very indecent. The people are still calling for you and will not go home. Lord Melbourne says, will you please go out on the balcony once more? Madam Lehzen, I cannot let them see me like this, I cannot. It will never do. Victoria! On your coronation day? My coronation day, Lehzen, but dash's bath night. The Duke of Wellington reminded me. Regarding the horse, Wellington, you will be firm? Firm, is it? My dear boy, if it's anything to do with the troops, I'll not be dictated by a chit of a girl, - queen or no queen. - Ah. Now I understand why she calls you the old rebel. She calls me what? The old rebel. Rebel, me? Rebel, is it? Old rebel. Old! Why, I'll teach her. Going, charge. Ma'am, the Duke has a little matter he wishes to discuss with you. Well? I hear, ma'am, you have the idea of reviewing the troops on a horse. And why not? Why not? Well it would be impossible. And why? Well, I guess, ma'am, it would be indelicate. Indelicate? I am as good a judge of indelicacy as you are, my lord Duke. What next? I haven't got a quiet horse. I do not want a quiet horse. Remember, my lord Duke, no horse, no review. Lord Wellington? Eh? She said her little say, she set her little jaw, and she rode her little horse. Ah! She's a good 'UN. Aye. But it's time she was looking about, huh? What for? A husband. Don't you worry about her. When she wants a husband, she'll get a husband, and not a minute before. Perhaps she don't want a husband. What we want is an heir to the throne. That's what we want. Don't you worry yourself. There's plenty thinks the same as you, and they're all up on us. Ministers come and go, you can't have me always beside you. I am growing old and a little weary. But you do need someone else beside you, close and all the time, with your own youth and zeal. Lord Melbourne, if you are speaking of marriage again, it's not to be thought of. Not for three or four years, at least. Oh, but ma'am, the country is looking for an heir. Lord Melbourne, do you consider that a proper observation to make to a young, unmarried girl? When the young, unmarried girl is the queen of england, I do, your highness. But I could not marry a subject and there's no foreigner suitable. Your uncle knows one he considers very suitable. Oh, uncle Leopold. Uncle Leopold is always trying to rule the roost. Who is it? Your cousin Albert. Albert? That young man? Straight laced, bookish, self-willed. Goes to bed immediately after dinner every night and never dances. He won't do. May I remind your highness that English only is to be spoken between the hours from nine to 11? The mirasole beetle has 24 legs and is found mainly in eastern regions. The female usually devours her mate immediately after the wedding night. The tin mines of cornwall are of immeasurable value, and in south wales there's a huge... What's all this about? England. Important for you. Oh, nonsense. Gentlemen, I had an invitation for you this morning to visit england. Who, for Ernest or myself? - For both. - Are you going to London? Yes, and so are you. Only you don't know it yet. I, why should I? I suppose it's you she's going to marry. You are the elder. It's not settled yet. Ah, based on which, the female usually devours her mate immediately after the wedding night. I shall not marry. And suppose you like her all of a sudden? How could I? Dances all night and never in bed 'til dark. Self-willed, frivolous, and light. No, she won't do. Oh, lord Melbourne. What are you doing? Sitting. But you look so funny. Yes, ma'am. You see my portrait has to be finished and I get so little time. I wasn't expecting your majesty. Oh let me help you. So indignant already. Thank you, ma'am. I have never enjoyed a laugh so much. Nor I. Now, lord Melbourne, I'm regretting my hasty invitation to my cousins, I feel so perplexed and troubled. I've written this letter, postponing their visit for some months. I must have time to reconsider the whole matter. Yes, ma'am. I think maybe it's as well. This morning I heard from them. They, too, require a postponing, especially prince Albert. - Albert? - Yes, ma'am. Albert suggested postponing? Yes, ma'am. Well, why does he do that? Well presumably for the same reason, ma'am. He doesn't want to come. Lord Melbourne, please let him know that I wish him here immediately. Also, my cousin Ernest. Yes, ma'am. - Well? - Huh? How can one live happily in a country that's so difficult to get to? Jolly good day, m'lord. Oh, good morning, harbour master. They are very late, are they not? Yes, two hours late getting into the harbour. Oh dear. Well I hope he's a good sailor. Most people on board seem to be sick. Seem what? Seem to be seasick. Oh. But you feel alright, don't you? Why, of course. Don't you? Yes, but I don't know how long it'll last. All ready, m'lord. Lord Melbourne has just come aboard to welcome you. Tell him I'm more than ever determined to withdraw from the whole affair. Brother, we'll go back to our own dear Germany on the first occasion. No, we won't. We'll wait for the first calm day. Lord Melbourne. I fear your highnesses had a miserable crossing. It could have been worse, lord Melbourne. We might have sunk. What I have been praying for all the time. And the hold is gone. Half of the luggage is ruined and the other half overboard. Oh dear, dear, dear. Then we have to meet our cousin like this? Your highness? Your highness? Who is there? May I inform her majesty that you are ready to be presented? Oh yes. Yes, we are ready. Just a minute, please. Lehzen, inform lord Melbourne I will receive my cousins. Ernest. - Yeah? - Wake up. Are we sinking? No, we are late. Hours late. I'm not accustomed to waiting one hour for anyone. But 'drina, they may be here at any moment. I have no great wish to meet my cousin Albert. The whole subject is an odious one, a most disagreeable thing. I shall go for my customary drive. Pray tell brown to make ready the pony chaise. Round and round and up and down. Victoria is waiting. One expects it on a boat, but the room might keep quiet. Ah, hurry up, Ernest. It'll soon be over. Now we are here, we must see her and pay our respects, and then home. Home, at once. Home, cross that ocean again. Lord Melbourne, her majesty has gone out for a drive. She has gone out? She says she is not accustomed to waiting over one hour for anyone. Well, but you see baroness, unfortunately they had nothing to wear. - Nothing to wear? - No! But lord Melbourne. Where are my trousers? I've got no boots. Oh dear. Lehez, are they not arrived yet? They have arrived with us, but without clothes. Without clothes? Suitable clothes. Your highnesses, may I please ask you, will you make all haste you can? Your majesty, their royal highnesses prince Ernest - and prince Albert. - Lehzen. Under no circumstances do you leave me alone with them. Welcome, dear cousin Ernest. You, too, Albert. I'm sorry you had so bad a journey and that you lost your luggage. The welcome we found makes up for all we lost. You are still fond of music, Ernest? Especially Albert, he's a most excellent musician. Charming. Well, you still catch butterflies and beetles? Especially Albert. He's just discovered a beetle with 24 legs. Perhaps her majesty would permit us to withdraw, lord Melbourne? You kindly promised to show me the picture gallery. With your majesty's permission? I will show his royal highness the pictures in the gallery? Ernest, do you, too, like pictures? - Indeed, yes. - Yes? Oh, lord Melbourne. Our dear cousin Ernest is also interested in art. You will show him the paintings first. But if Albert wishes to see them first? I desire that you shall see them first. And, lord Melbourne, above all your portrait. Most interesting, on a horse. In a hat. Lehzen, go after them. Tell my cousin to observe above everything the extraordinary likeness of the hat. Sit down, Albert. Well, courage, cousin. I'm not going to eat you. Can't you look more pleasant? I don't feel pleasant. What is the matter? Do you know who we have to thank for this? Uncle Leopold. Albert, they say she dances beautifully. Does she? You haven't danced with her yet. I haven't been asked. Her majesty will dance with you. With prince Ernest, your highness. Ernest, you like dancing? Yes, indeed. We will dance. You enjoy dancing, Ernest? Yes, indeed. Especially Albert. You have always been together, you and Albert. I envy you. I have always been alone. It is entirely in your majesty's hands to alter this state of affairs. Could you leave your brother, Ernest? I don't understand? I mean, would such a parting be very painful to you? Such a parting would become unimportant, your majesty, if it is a question of higher sentiments. I trust your highness is enjoying himself? Immensely. What time does the steamboat leave for rosenau tomorrow? You mean to leave us? I'm afraid I have to. It is impossible for me to stay away from rosenau longer. Well? She dances beautifully. Did she say anything? Yes, next dance will be waltz by Mr. Strauss. We return to coburg tomorrow. Tomorrow? Your highness, her majesty will dance with you. - With me? - Yes, your highness. Tomorrow. You, too, like dancing, Albert? I prefer reading. But, you like this dancing music played so beautifully by Mr. Strauss? I prefer Beethoven. Albert, we will dance. Albert, you dance beautifully! Thank you. Oh but you really do not like this piece by Mr. Strauss? Oh, this one? Oh yes, I do like it, very much. But you dance beautifully. Oh, I adore it above everything. Indeed, Mr. Strauss does play the Walt-zeh... Walt... zeh? Waltz dance better than anyone else. I think it's rather a shocking dance. But very pleasant. Oh, very pleasant. I don't know when I've enjoyed a dance as much. I know I never have. A wonderful bouquet. - Isn't it? - Yes, isn't it? It keeps as fresh and lovely as, it's mistress. Albert. Your majesty, this dance I claim. Be seated. Lord Melbourne, I'm happy. Such a dear young man, so frank, so really young and gay. You know, I have seldom had young people around me. I must sometimes. Nothing more natural. Lord Melbourne, I have quite made up my mind. I'm more than glad. My only wish is for your happiness. Well? She dances beautifully. Home tomorrow? I must tell prince Albert of my decision. Yes, you should. But how? Such things are usually the other way around. Yet, he could not propose to the sovereign. He would never take such a Liberty. Of course not, of course not. I must make the proposal myself. As soon as prince Albert arrives, I will receive him. Her majesty will see you immediately, your highness, - in the library. - Yes. Your hat, your highness. - Huh? - Your hat. Oh, yes. You sent for me? Oh yes, please sit down, Albert. Over there. Oh, Albert. Have you seen this new invention? They call them photographs. It's a kind of machine. They point it at you and you have to stand still in front of it for a very long time, but then, oh well, there you are forever. Really? One doesn't know what they'll invent next. No. There is mama. Oh. And uncle Leopold. Down there in the corner. And she is said to be the most handsome of my ladies. And that's me. Yes. A landscape. A very typical view of england. Do you think there is a great difference between england and Germany? Oh, yes, there is. You are very fond of your country, Albert? Of course, I am. You like england, too? Very much. Do you think you could ever feel at home here? I hope I will. Then why should you ever leave? Oh, Albert. You have gained my whole heart. It would make me very happy if you would consent to share your life with me. If you could make that sacrifice? Sacrifice? Yes, well, I feel myself so unworthy. How can you say that? If it quite bewilders me that you should love me? I'll do everything in my power to make you happy. Albert. Nothing could have gone better. My deepest wishes for your long happiness, both of you. Thank you, lord Melbourne. A wish that's shared in by everyone else. You hear? The sight of you will be very welcome. Indeed, lord Melbourne. Albert, your arm. There! Are you the engine driver? Yes, sir. My lord, if you please. Yes, m'lord. I am the Earl of albermarle and master of the queen's horse. It is my duty to inspect her majesty's travelling equipment, horse or no horse. Is this contraption of yours in working order? Well I suppose it's alright, but I wish they were going in some other manner. Why? I detest these steam carriages, wretched things, and you know quite disastrous to the country. Oh, you think so? Why, of course. Giving rise to a shocking set of people without respect for anything or anybody. I am her majesty's coachman in chief. If she were travelling in a proper, Christian manner, I should be driving her. But however she travels, I'm going to drive her. Eh? At least accompany the driver. You know the first sensation is that of nervousness before being run away with. But a sense of security soon supervenes and a velocity of 15 miles an hour. Oh, it's delightful. Yeah, well you'll never get me into one. I can't allow nobody up here. Oh, not in that thing? On the box. On the what? Yes, on the box! He'll be better off in a box. I hope your majesty has noticed the new policeman, for which you are indebted to sir Robert. Yes, a fine body of men. - Known as peelers. - And bobbies. Bobbies? Bobbies? Oh, I like that, bobbies. My clear, we mustn't keep it waiting. Goodbye my dear lord Melbourne. Goodbye, ma'am. My work is done and this is goodbye indeed. How can I ever thank you? Your thanks are my reward and more than I deserve, my dear majesty. Be happy, Albert. But don't fight with regards to your happiness. Oh, I am so glad it's all over. But Albert, it was very beautiful. Yes. But it's much more beautiful now, because we are alone. How do you call this in English? This going away after a wedding? - Honeymoon. - Honeymoon? Nice. - And in German? - Flittennochen. Flitter vogen. No, not flitter vogen. Flitterwochen. - Flittennochen. - Yes. Oh, I like that. Do you have steam trains in Germany, Albert? Yes, of course we have. But not as fast as this. Look, there are the boys from eton school, and they can hardly keep up with us. That shows how fast we are travelling. Honeymoon. Flittennochen. Oh, darling. Your accent is so charming. You know, Albert, I used only to speak German, until I was nine years old. Uncle Leopold liked it. Oh, uncle Leopold. He's a good man and a good king. You know we owe all this to him. I have written him this morning. And what did you say? I told him that I am the happiest being alive. Anyhow, you must go down into history as the queen who spent the longest flittennochen. Oh, my dear. After all you forget, I am the queen. Business cannot stop and wait for anything. Parliament is sitting and everyday I am needed for something. Even two days is a long time to be away. Two days? Oh must we go back so soon? Yes, I have to return specially to discuss with sir Robert peel a new tax. He calls it the income tax. Oh I fear it is not going to be very popular. Oh yes, that's a very interesting experiment. We have in coburg a professor of this new political economy who has written a long work on the subject. I read it with great interest and myself wrote him a long commentary on it. This evening I'll explain it to you. Oh no, my dearest. This evening, music. No, Victoria, first work and then play. Music, dearest. No, Victoria. But Albert, I wish never to discuss with you anything so dull as politics. Oh. Your highness. Stockmar, yes, I know. I am the husband to the queen. But what might that be? No one here seems to know or care. Peel can't stand my intel, Wellington refuses me my rank, and the royal family cry out against the foreign interloper. You have my sympathy, your highness. But lord Melbourne has gone. She has not the same confidence in peel. Oh yes, and this ma'am for your perusal. Mr. Roland hill's memorandum on postal office reform. Oh yes. In the future, let us article for a one penny stamp. That is so, ma'am. Well surely an excellent measure. Let's hope so, ma'am. Let's hope so. But from now, people in their thousands will be spreading gossip and scandal, writing things they wish they hadn't, and for one penny, obtruding their garrulous selves into our very homes. It's a leap in the dark, ma'am, a leap in the dark. She will inevitably turn to you. You must be patient. Patient. I'll leave these documents, ma'am, for your perusal. Dear oh dear, sir Robert. I get mussed reading them all. Well if I might suggest, ma'am, you husband would gladly share the burden, a man of so great ability and judgement. The English are very jealous and suspicious of any foreigner interfering in their government, sir Robert. I know, ma'am. - But surely... - No. He's everything in the world to me as a husband. In matters of state, he must stand aside. Good day, ma'am. Good day, sir Robert. I play the piano, read philosophy, and walk our pets. After all my high hopes, useless. Except you, stockmar, I have no friends, no one to talk to. I cannot even say to anyone here how I miss the white flowers in the woods at coburg. They wouldn't understand. Sentiment is a plant that will not grow in england. If an englishman finds himself growing sentimental, he goes out and shoots himself. > Come oh my love, prepare thee > through dreamland to wander with me > a garden I know of roses > by moonlight silver o'er > upon the lake reposes > a balmy lotus flower > upon the lake reposes > a balmy lotus flower oh Albert, how beautiful you play. Plenty of time to practise. How I envy you your music and your books. You know I am only quite happy when I'm with you. What a morning I have had. 28,000 documents go through the foreign office alone in one year. - ...28,000. - Mm-hmm. I should have thought I might have helped with at least one of them. - How cold it is in here. - Mm-hmm. I ordered a fire. Yes, I know you did. But you had no right to order a fire. No right? No right. You have to acquaint the lord high steward if you want a fire, and he gives the orders. Well, where is he? At the moment in Staffordshire. Now if he were here, you wouldn't get a fire. No, his province is to get it lit. Your lord Chamberlain has to order the lighting of it, and he is busy at St. James'. But the ordering of the coal, that comes under the office of woods and forests and needs a special government order, if not an act of parliament. Why, Albert, how clever of you to have found all this out. In future, whilst I am attending to my important matters of state, you shall look after all the domestic details of the household. Albert, I think this new piece will be very popular. Ladies, we will talk. Is smoking still forbidden in the palace? Absolutely, m'lord. Everywhere? Everywhere. But in my room, I have a chimney and smokes. Shocking! I'm just gonna see to it. - Sir Robert? - Ma'am? A word with you, about this new tax of yours. - The income tax. - Oh yes, we have a professor - in coburg... - Albert? Oh but I should be interested to hear his highness' views. But sir Robert, our guests need entertaining. Albert, if you please? Now, do you anticipate the public will have to make a very large contribution? I fear, ma'am, it may be considerable. Miss pitt, will you sing? If you will play, your highness. Seven pennies on the pound. Seven pennies! Such a song will be unendurable. Let me see, some 40 years ago, William pick introduced some such Levy upon income. The country was at war, and war costs money, and the money had to be found. > On wings of song I'll bear thee > enchanted realms to see after the war, the tax was found to be so odious that it was immediately removed, as it was introduced as purely a temporary measure. > In dreamland to wander with me > a garden I know of roses I must again, however, in my opinion, ma'am, the country is faced with evils that have to be fought just as vigorously and urgently. > Upon the lake reposes > the balmy lotus flower > upon the lake reposes social reforms cost money. But I assure your majesty as I shall assure the whole country, that the introduction of this tax upon income > a balmy lotus flower shall be made purely as an emergency and temporary measure. > Will never fade A thousand thanks. I never heard it more sweetly sang. We shall retire. It's his highness that I feel sorry for. At present with the Fender under my fifth rib, I've no sympathy to spare for anyone. A German without a pipe. I wonder how he endures it? How do you know he does? Oh, m'lord, his highness is the perfect husband. That must be her majesty. She must have smelt it from here! Really? Lehzen, tell the gentlemen in waiting I wish to see the prince. Yes, your majesty. Her majesty wishes... Do I smell nicotine smoke? Oh, yes, baroness. There is a slight odour of smoke. Yes, there is. Her majesty wishes to see his highness immediately. Yes, baroness. Your highness, her majesty wishes to see you. Thank you. Albert, I sent for you. I received your message. Then why did you not come? I hadn't finished my pipe. Albert! And smoking. Mm-hmm. Albert, you know that smoking is forbidden. I didn't forbid it. But I did. That's the trouble. I'm the husband of the mistress of the house, but not it's master. Albert, it is ill mannered of you to smoke when you know that I dislike it. Victoria, it is ill mannered to behave as you did this evening to our guests. The manners of a queen should be beyond reproach. Albert! Albert, how dare you. Goodnight, ma'am. Albert! Who is there? Your queen. The queen must wait. Who is there? Victoria. Who is there? Your wife, Albert. I've been through this, Victoria. The changes I recommended have been made. It's ready for your signature. Albert, how should I manage without your help? Shall they who call the earth their own take all away and give us stone? And why do they call the earth their own? Because they took it! By force! And now the few are living on the fat of the land their father's stole! Call themselves england! While we starve on filth, chalk and plaster and alum for bread. Our baby children die in the factories! Our women slave in the mines! Within a few miles of this very palace, there are homeless and starving. That's england! Traitors! To the tower with you! Lehzen. Lehzen. Albert. There's nothing to be afraid of nor cry about. I'm not afraid. You risked your life for me, Albert. That makes me so happy. Ah, they're as pleased as we are. Yes, we must go to them. Your highness, her majesty herself amended the bulletin. My statement was that both the queen and the prince are perfectly well. She insists on the queen and the infant prince, her thought being that her subjects might suppose that you, too, have been confined, your highness. Your highness? The prince of wales, Albert. The first in nearly a hundred years. What do you think of him? He's very, red. Mr. Grimwig, what a strange name. What are you reading, dearest? The last instalment of a new story by Mr. Dickens, Oliver twist. Such accounts of poverty and squalor and vice set among work houses and pick pockets and coffin makers. Surely such degradation and starvation cannot exist. What is that? Desperate to cure them. How hungry. Indeed, ma'am, I am in entire agreement, but it places me in a very painful position. The party that I lead, the learned aristocracy, the country gentlemen, the farmers, all believe that the repeal of the corn laws would spell their ruin. Sir Robert, I hope that no opposition, even of your friends, will prevent your doing what we all feel to be right. With the support of your majesty and of the prince, I will do everything in my power. We both appreciate your courage and true loyalty. And sir Robert? Such a good cause as ours must succeed. With such faith and such determination, ma'am, it shall succeed. But it will be a fight. Elected as a protectionist, I go down to the house to propose free trade, to oppose the very principles and people that gave me power. Ha, what a young chance for young disraeli. I remember the right honourable gentleman making his protection speeches. They were he finest speeches I ever heard. It was a great thing, a grand thing to hear him say, "I would rather be the leader of the gentlemen of england "than possess the confidence of sovereigns." The confidence of sovereigns, he has told us here today that he now possess it. He might have gone further. He might have added that he now holds a sovereign in his hand. I, for one, would have agreed with him. I would have gone further still. I would have said that he now has a sovereign under his thumb. And what of the gentlemen of england? We don't hear much of them now. No, they were his first love. It's the old, old story. Love and passionate vows and protestations, and then protestations. And then unfaithfulness, and the betrayal! Mr. Speaker, I can assure the last speaker as I can assure the house, that I have not a sovereign in my hand, nor under my thumb, nor at my Beck, but at my side. The last speaker made very merry at my expense because I have changed my opinion. Well he is very young. He has yet to learn that to change one's opinion in the face of a threatened calamity to the nation does not imply a loss of honour, but rather that one places honour before everything. Before personal friendship, before position, before power! For I am under no delusions, gentlemen, it is those things which I have forfeited by my change in opinion. Nevertheless, I hope I may leave a name sometimes remembered in the abodes of those whose lot it is to labour and earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, when they shall recruit their exhausted strength with abundant and untaxed food. You know, Lehzen, he has even gone down to the house himself to hear the debate. His own idea. Oh, he has such an understanding about English politics, so wise, so helpful. The prince is an illustrious and royal personage, but he must be made aware that his presence in this house is most objectionable. Here here. If he has been persuaded here by peel to give a semblance of royal support to this most controversial measure, then he must be informed that such blatant partisanship cannot be tolerated by the country that has adopted him. Here here! Her majesty is in her apartments? Yes, your highness. His highness has just returned. Thank you, Lehzen. Well, what happened? I have heard peel abused like a most disgraceful criminal, but he won. He won? Oh, I am so grateful to him. And Albert, you who have done so much, you were there to hear it. Yes, my first visit to parliament, and my last. My dear? I have been told that my presence there was indiscrete, ill advised, dragging you into party politics. Who dared? Nobody could understand that I went there only because I wanted to listen and to learn. My dearest. But in future, I should keep away. Chancellor here to check in, my lord. Yeah, gladstone, come in. How are ya? Sit down. Had to send for ya, momentous news. May put an end to our non-intervention in this civil war in america. What happened? An outrage by the Americans on the British flag. Well the south tried to get two men through to Europe to plead their cause. They got through the blockade of the northerners, boarded a British ship, the Trent, when northern man of war ploughed across her boughs, boarded her, and arrested the two southerners. Violation of international law. I drafted a note I'm sending to the Washington governor. Rather strong. Meant to be, teach 'em a lesson. Queen and prince Albert won't appreciate this. Can't be helped. That couple seem to think our part in policies and particular preserve of their own. Besides, they're at balmoral. Charming spot, balmoral. So far away. I'm to tell ya they'd be very honoured if you'd join them in eightsome reel? Well, I should enjoy that, brown. What do you think, eh? The mother of nine. Aye. And a fine. Ah, she's a fine one, isn't she? Yeah, but she's not scotch. Who is not scotch? - She is not scotch. - The queen? - Yeah. - No scotch, and the Stuart and boleyn is running through her veins. - The Stuart and boleyn? - Aye, Stuart and boleyn for 300 years. - How many? - 400 years. A dispatch from London, your highness. Listen here, she's our queen, isn't she? She's your queen. Aye, well we're gonna drink to her. Very well. To the queen. Queen. We must return to London at once. At once. We will receive lord palmerston immediately. Your majesty, the prime minister. We meet, my lord, under the dreadful threat of war. A time for plain speaking. You are sending to america a most hasty, ill-considered document without thought of its consequences. This country, your highness, is able to brave consequences. But it's not you, m'lord, who bear the consequences. It is my people who have to wipe out your blunders with their lives. Blunders? A strong word, your majesty. But I agree with his highness, a moment for plain speaking. The honour of this country is being threatened. Our people are almost frantic with indignation, and they know that next to the throne is a man brought up in a foreign court, full of foreign ideas, with many ties both of blood and sympathy with foreign government. And the throne itself will be naturally under his influence. Lord palmerston, how dare you! While I have any influence, lord palmerston, I will use it against plunging this country into unnecessary war, and against the people of your own blood. Perhaps because I'm a foreigner, I can see more clearly the sheer madness of it. That I have ever worked against the true interests of england is a lie. A wicked and foolish lie. And you know it. Your majesty, I do not speak for myself, I do but repeat what I feel it my duty to let you know things that are being shouted in public, whispered in private, filling the newspapers, harked about on broadsheets. Indeed we must face the fact that the prince is the best hated man in the country. And you the best loved. That would at least give your highness and myself something in common, to be opposite ends of the same stick. Lord palmerston, we are not amused. My lord, I give you a positive command, your dispatch to america must not go in its present form. It must be submitted to myself and to the prince. Disobedience in a servant of the crown will not be tolerated, on that I insist. If I am denied, to the point of abdication. The dispatch shall be in your hands this evening. The wing sealed up? Oh yes, my lord, hours ago. Order should be back by midnight. Might as well wait up. Yes, my lord. My dear, it is far into the night. You must have some rest. I had to redraft the whole dispatch. Well can it not wait until the morning? No rest 'til this is fin, finished. My dearest, you are shivering. Would you like some hot tea? Servants are all in bed. Oh, no matter, I will make it for you myself. What time is it? My lord, it's nearly three o'clock in the morning. No news from the palace? Not yet, my lord. Well then, I have got an appointment first thing in the morning with the commander in chief of the army. We are sending an expeditionary force of 10,000 men. Immediately afterwards with the first sea load, we are doubling the naval forces in the Atlantic, as likely as not they'll invade Canada, when en route. This may mean the final dissolution of the United States of America. Here you are. As we agreed, I have so worded it that the incident can be closed without loss of national honour to either country. And there, dear, finished. Now dearest, drink your tea. I can't. Albert, what is it? I am so tired. Gentlemen, I have received the note from england. It is with deep thankfulness I am able to tell you it is not hostile and menacing, as we'd feared. It is temperate and conciliatory, courteous and friendly. It is now certain that this calamity, hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in a prepared missive of the British minister, which the queen and prince Albert, promptly and positively cancelled. Do you really think, sir James, are other expert medical opinions desired? No, no, no, not in the least. I am seriously alarmed. What? If things went wrong, it would be calamitous for the queen. Oh, he's been overworking, overtaxing his strength with worrying. If we alter all that, there's no need for anxiety. And the queen? I persuaded her out for a breath of air, up and down one of the terraces, but she's seldom away from the hall for a minute. There she is. Your majesty, I am intensely relieved to hear good news of the prince. His illness makes us all realise how invaluable his life is. Which is ironic, m'lord, that it should take an illness to do that. I bring messages to you both from all of your ministers, our sympathy and affection. Please convey to them our sincere thanks. He is better, sir James? Without a doubt. I have known many worse cases and he is definitely past the crisis. What infinite relief. I have been worried. It is strange not to have him with me all the time. You know, I turn to him in everything. 21 years we have been married, and our marriage is not only full of friendship and kindness, but there is the same love as in the first few days. Lately he has been so low, so sad. He's been in poor health. It is more then that. Popularity he has never sought, nor desired, but he's been so misrepresented, so misunderstood, and had to suffer everything in silence. But ma'am, those of us who are close to him know there's not a single aspect of the national life he's not made himself acquainted with and better, art, science, music, the army, and the great exhibition. Yes, that great palace of crystal glass. Oh, sir James, I feel sure now the country will appreciate what he is doing, what he plans to do. May I go in to him? Of course. Good evening, mama. How does he seem tonight? Still quiet, so very quiet. Now, Alice, there is no need to worry. He is much better. Sir James has just told me he has definitely past the worst. Oh, I am so glad. Ernest, ask Ernest to come. And mama, perhaps it would be better if I did not play the evening hymn tonight? Oh no, my dear. Play as usual. He would be disappointed if you did not. Yes, mama. God bless you, dear. - Goodnight, mama. - Goodnight, Alice. Ernest? Ask Ernest to come. But Albert, Ernest is far away in coburg. How it rains. How can one live happily in a country that's so difficult to get to? Where the birds always sing the same, next year, and the next, and the next. Yes, dearest, and we will listen to them together. No, stockmar. No, I'll not. I'll not forget. I'll not spare myself. No war. Stockmar, no war. Albert, stockmar has gone. Do you not know me? Albert, do you not know me? Why are you so far away? I am not far away. I am here, close to you, your wife, Victoria. Ernest was right. You dance beautifully. - Albert. - Don't look so frightened. You frighten me. Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. If only I knew those I loved were well cared for, I should be ready to die tomorrow. But you are not going to die, you are going to get well. Sir James has just told me he is very pleased with you. Don't leave me. They're waiting for me at the tower. I've done my best. Albert? Albert? Albert! And so I ask you, why should royal hands help themselves to the pockets of the people and take from them vast sums to spend on the splendour of a crown they never see? A crown that the widow has wrapped in crepe and put in the windsor pawn shop? I do not feel any great horror at the idea of the possible establishment of a republic in his country. I am quite certain that sooner or later it will come. I think there has been by many persons a great injustice done to the queen in reference to her desolate and widowed position. And I venture to say this, that a woman, be she queen of a great realm or be she the wife of one of your labouring men, who can keep alive in her heart a great sorrow for the lost object of her life and affection is not at all likely to be wanting in a great and generous sympathy with you. Good morning, brown. Morning to you. You taking a wee walk on the terrace this morning? Something has been changed here. Nothing has been changed. Do not fuss yourself. His diary has been picked up and replaced, but not in the same position. You are right, I did it myself. It was covered with dust, so I picked it up, gave a wee blow at it, and put it back. This, brown, is the 10th anniversary of the day he visited aldershot to inspect the troops for the last time. Tonight you will set out his uniform as a field marshal of the British army. Aye, he looked fine in that one, fine. He looked the man he was. Your majesty, the prime minister desires an audience. I will see him here, brown. Her majesty'll see him here. They want to force me back into the ceremonials, brown, into the public appearances that I shared with him. You'll not let them? I will not. Shall I stay with ye? I can deal with Mr. Gladstone. You can, that. The prime minister. Your majesty. I fear this visit is most unwelcome. I fear so, too, Mr. Gladstone. I find what I have to say very difficult. Proceed. Ma'am, The public appearance of the sovereign from time to time is among the substantial and even indispensable means of maintaining the full influence of the monarchy. Surely the occupant of the throne should be prepared to make such sacrifices as that August position demands. Mr. Gladstone, do not address me as if I were a public meeting. What you suggest, that I should display in public my private grief, is too much to ask. But ma'am, the living have their claims as well as the dead. And what claims could be more imperative than those of a great nation? I feel sure, Mr. Gladstone, that the nation do not desire the spectacle of a poor, broken hearted widow, dragged out alone in state for a show. But as you have come to me, I will say this for your guidance, it is my firm resolve, my irrevocable decision, that his wishes and his plans in everything shall be my law. But this retirement, this complete withdrawal from all public service, would that have been his wish? Good day, ma'am. Would that have been his wish? I'll do everything in my power to make you happy. Albert, how should I manage without your help? And you, Albert. You have done so much. You were there to hear. That I have ever worked against the trust interests of england is a lie. I've done my best. I, too, will do my best, Albert. Your majesty, for many years now, with untiring energy, with the widest sympathy, and with an indomitable sense of duty, you have applied yourself to the work of government with greater ardour and greater industry than any of your predecessors. You have watched england grow from an agricultural country to a land of railways, telegraphs, canals, factories, and ports. And whence her shipping sails out over the seven seas and the four corners of the earth. You have seen the worst horrors of poverty disappear. Children no longer slave in the mills, nor women in the mines. Under your own kindliness have been born a greater kindliness between rich and poor. As the fortunate spokesman whose proud duty it is to tell you that today you have nearly 200 million more subjects and a new empire, I add with absolute sincerity that this gift, great though it is, can never be more than you yourself deserve at the hands of your most grateful people. So in presenting these princes of your new empire of India, may I be the first to salute you, Victoria Regina et imperatrix, queen and empress. I'll thank you, lord beaconsfield. And to all of you who have come so far to bring your royal greetings, my thanks. And I would take this first opportunity of assuring you that all the bitterness of the dreadful civil war between our races has been utterly forgotten. There is no hatred of a brown skin, none. It is my greatest wish to see my new subjects on an equality with the other British subjects of the crown. Happy, contented, and flourishing. And, as I rejoice, do have with me here so many friends from all my dominions overseas. From Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. I cannot but feel it, not so much as a queen or an empress, but rather as a mother. Though, perhaps I should say as the grandmother of a great family. And that, to me, is the proudest title of them all. For it is one of the great families of mankind, which if it is true to it's own principles of democracy, tolerance, and freedom, may well mould the destinies of the whole world. Your majesty, in the name of this great concourse of your subjects who are gathered together solely to do honour to their beloved queen, may I congratulate you, not only because you have reigned over us for 60 glorious years, but because you are today more secure on your throne than any ruler in the world, being enthroned forever in the hearts of your people. > Praise god from whom all blessings flow > praise him all creatures here below > praise him above ye heavenly host > praise father, son, and holy ghost > amen carry on, girl! Mother's come home! How kind they are to me. How very kind. Three cheers for her majesty. Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! May god bless all my people. > God save our gracious queen > Long live our noble queen > God save the queen > Send her victorious > Happy and glorious > Long to reign over us Albert, we have done our best. > Land of hope and glory > Mother of the free > How shall we extol thee > Who are born of the free > God who made thee mighty > Make thee mightier yet
