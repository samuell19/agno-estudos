WOMAN: There's an isolation to the woods, isn't there? A sense of unease in a dark wilderness. Because things disappear there. Things die there. But she wasn't afraid. Not at first. Even though she was alone, she knew she could survive the night. But as she got deeper into the forest, she smelled it. The rot. The smell of death. CONTINUES ON RADIO: She finally found them in the clearing. By now, the long, hot summer had caused the bodies to putrefy. The flies and maggots were crawl... No fucking way. (CRASHING) (EXHALES) (PHONE BEEPS) (BREATHING RAPIDLY) - (GASPS) - (TWIG SNAPS) (RUSTLING) (GASPS) (RUSTLING) (GASPS) (RUSTLING) (EXHALES) (SCREECHING SOUND) (GASPS) Oh! - (ENGINE STALLS) - (GROANS) - (AXE THUDS) - (SCREAMS) - (SCREAMING CONTINUES) - (REPEATED AXE BLOWS) I can't make you straight. I don't wanna make you straight. Gay people are A-OK with me. If you're happy the way you are, then more power to you. And I know what you're thinking. You hear the words "gay conversion camp," and you start to imagine all kinds of homophobic bullshit. Well, that is not what we're about here. And let me tell you another thing. God... God doesn't hate you either. And any son of a bitch that tells you otherwise is a bigoted asshole. And that is officially the last time that you're gonna hear about the man upstairs. I promise you. But I'm guessing that some of you are here because in some way you're not happy. Maybe you don't fit in. People make fun of you. Maybe you wanna find some new kind of peace, a new way of thinking about yourself. Well, you give us this week, and we might be able to help. And if not, just enjoy the sunshine, and work on your tan. OK. Let me introduce you to my colleagues. They do all the real work. I just cash the checks. This is Dr. Cora Whistler. She is our licensed therapist, and as you might have guessed from the name, my wife. She who must be obeyed. Next to her is Nurse Molly who takes care of any little mishaps that may occur. Molly's new here, so take it easy on her. And that's Zane, our athletics director and a former student here. So, he knows all the ropes. And, boys, he's taken, so hands off. And that beautiful woman right there is Sarah, Zane's fiancé. She's our activities director, and she is going to keep you busy. Believe you me. (WHEELBARROW CREAKS) And over here we have Balthazar. That's our handyman, all-around Mr. Fix it. Say hello, Balthazar! And that, finally, is old Duke. Duke is one old hound dog. So please treat him kindly. OK. I'm gonna need you to hand over all your cell phones and computers. (ALL GASP) As well as any medicines, narcotics, or cigarettes that you may have. Cell phones don't work out here anyway, and I'm glad to say that we don't have any Wi-Fi. So we are off the grid which will be a nice change, I'm sure. Molly, if you would. Thank you. OK. Let me tell you how the next week is gonna work. We have a number of planned activities and therapy sessions that we would like you to be part of. But other than that, you're on your own. We do have one hard-and-fast rule here. And it's about respect. We deal with some sensitive issues, and we expect you to treat your fellow students with care. And allow them their dignity. This is a safe space. For everyone. And this is the most important thing that I want to say to you. I know that many of you are here only because your parents made you. And while their intentions may be honorable, only you can know what's best for you. Because the idea of this place is not to come out more straight or less gay. Of course we hope that through your time here you will discover a gender normative lifestyle that is authentic for you but... you must find your own truth. Let us help you do that. Please. OK. So, uh, why don't you head to your cabins? Settle in. Unpack. We'll meet in the lodge in say, uh, a half hour and get started. Boys' cabin over there. Girls' cabin over there. Yes. - So this is a thing. - OK. I'm trans and non binary. I use they/them pronouns. As in, they can't believe they're at this fucking camp. I'm assuming you don't have an all-gender cabin. No. Not currently. Obviously we need one. Maybe so. This place is all about inclusion. About being with other kids and finding a sense of community. So it's important that nobody be isolated. I acknowledge and respect your transition. So head over to the boys' cabin, and if you don't feel comfortable there, we can talk about other options. How's that? Sounds great. Great. Thanks. And thanks for understanding. - (SCOFFS) They? - Yes, ma'am. (LAUGHS) I want to start with a simple question. Why are you here? Toby? I'm here because I don't want to be a big flaming fruit anymore. I wanna play hockey and drink non-light beer like all the normal guys. I made a deal with my parents. If I spent the week here, I could go to New York and see Moulin Rouge! (ALL CHUCKLE) You look more like a Sondheim man. - Queen! - Well, you're looking at a guy that saw the original production of Merrilytwice. - Bitch! - (LAUGHS) Veronica. What about you? Why are you here? Um... - No. - MAN: Please. There's no judgments in this room, OK? Why are you here? Cause I'm bisexual. So, I'm a freak and I hate it. All right? Are you happy? I'm a swimmer. I know I can get a scholarship, but not like this. Not like I am. I mean, in the locker room I don't know where to look. I get so tense I have to, like, throw up. No one knows in school. I'd die if they found out. It's like I'm pretending to be this thing and... I don't wanna pretend anymore. My parents made me come. I just wanna fit in. It was come here or you're out on the street, honey. When I go to college, I'm gonna pledge my dad's fraternity, which I kind of have to, or he's gonna, like, disown me. I mean, house seats. I'm not that complicated, honestly. I just wanna be like everybody else. Fifth row, center. I wanna give my parents grandkids. Like my sister did. I'm only here to shut my parents up and get some fucking peace. I have zero interest in not being gay. I love me some lady. I hear it all the time. "Fag." "There goes the fag." "Blow me, fag." And the laughter. I don't wanna waste my soul fighting this thing. I just wanna make it go away. Sometimes I wish I was invisible. I wanna be entertained. I wanna live my life. I wanna fit in. I wanna be loved. Jordan, you're awfully quiet. Uh, I don't have anything to add. Is he gonna get away with that? - They. - Whatever the fuck. We all talked. Jordan, this is a circle of trust. We all shared. Why are you here? I come from a religious family. They don't understand me. We made a deal. If I come here for a week... they'll let me legally emancipate myself. Emancipate yourself to do what? Be myself. All right. I wanna thank you all for your trust and for your honesty. I've been through therapy, so I know how difficult this can be. Being at peace with yourself, with your true self, that's the hardest thing to do, isn't it? OK. That's it for today. So, dinner is in an hour, and we'll start up again in the morning. Enjoy the night. Wrong team, fuckwad. (GROANS) (BIRDS SING) (CLOCK TICKS) (FOOTSTEPS) (GASPS) Gentlemen, you have a new roommate. All I ask from you people is honesty. Honesty in how you treat each other. And honesty in how you present yourselves. Lying is not going to get us anywhere. I wasn't lying. This is who I am. Jordan treated me with respect by being truthful about their transition. You did not. Simple as that. OK, everyone out front. Ten minutes for roll call. And, please, dress appropriately. The fuck is this? What does it fucking look like, boyfriend? Freak show is what it looks like. How am I supposed to dress appropriately? I'm a woman. I don't have any goddamn boy clothes. JORDAN: Hey. Hey. Don't worry about it. OK? We'll get you some clothes. - Can anybody spare some clothes? - Not my vintage stuff, but sure. I'm not sure that entirely suits you, Jordan. Not my color? OK. I'd like you all to say hello to Alexander, who is obviously dealing with some complicated issues. We welcome him gladly and with love. OK, let's have some fun. (♪ "AIN'T NO MAN" BY THE AVETT BROTHERS) (BLOWS WHISTLE) - Go! - Pull! Pull it. Pull it. Come on. (SONG PLAYS OVER DIALOGUE) WOMAN: Can I help you? I need my pills. The ones you took. - I'm sorry, I can't. - No, honey, I need them. Sit down. Please. I don't make the rules here. If you wanna talk to Owen... I need them. It's the, uh, the Zoloft. This is a pretty powerful antidepressant. I don't think I can give it to you without checking with... Without checking with one of those fuckers who runs the place? Come on. As misguided as they may be about some things, I can't just ignore protocol. It's not Zoloft, all right? - Estradiol. - It's an estrogen hormone. - I made a deal with my parents. - I know. You come here, or they throw you out. ALEXANDRA: It's... It's not that. At all. When I turned 18, I thought there was nothing they could do to stop me. But I was wrong. I have a younger brother, and he means the world to me. And I mean the world to him. And they said that if I did not come to this place, that they would never let me see him again. Anyway, I need my pills. Our secret. This camp, do you even believe in any of this? I believe in healing. That's all. Maybe you should believe in dignity. (DOOR CLOSES) (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)?? Up and at 'em, gents! Get dressed! It's time to play. OK, let's hold up here. Everyone, please remove your blindfolds and gather round. Come on. Step up. Let me tell you something that I've learned. Self-reliance is a cornerstone of self-confidence and self-love. But trust in your community is vital. You're not alone. There is always help if you are brave enough to ask for it. Look at your partners. Go on. Look. Trust them. Accept them. Love them. OK. Each pair head off in a different direction, walk around for ten minutes and stop. And we will see you in the morning. What? Do you have a problem with that? No, sir. I'm sure the Geneva Convention has some protocol about this. Well, the next time I'm in Switzerland, I'll ask them. Now, start walking. Go on. Move. Go! - This should be cozy. - Fuck me. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) I don't know that I'm ready for all this. Yeah, you don't really give off camper vibes. No. I mean... Well, Alexander... Alexandra, whatever, I don't really know any trans people. He really surprised me. - It's "she", actually. - I can't even get that right. I just don't think like you guys do. I live in this super-straight suburb. Everyone's the same. Except me. - I know what you mean. - Do you? (LAUGHS) Look at you. You're so chill. Try that haircut in my school. No one would talk to you. - I'd talk to me. - I'd be scared to talk to you. You're not scared now. Just a little. (BOTH LAUGH) (OWL HOOTS) Alexandra. This doesn't feel right. This whole place. It's a gay conversion camp. Nothing about it's right. I know, but I would understand it a whole lot more if there was a lot more Bible- thumping and queer-bashing. But there's not. - That's what scares me. - (TWIG SNAPS) Who is that? (SIGHS) "A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man go out in a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God." - (AIR HORN BLARES) - (GASPS) Too late. I'm pregnant. (AIR HORN BLARES) (BANGING SOUND) You OK? Come in, please. It can't have been easy choosing to live this way. - It wasn't a choice. - I understand. Believe me, I've been there. I was a navy brat. I moved every few years. Base to base. It was all navy, all the time. All my brothers went into the navy. I was the only one who didn't. I was just so... different. After a while, I stopped trying to fit in. I was never gonna get my parents' love like my brothers. I suppose if I'd been of your generation... I might have chosen to become a boy too. So they wouldn't be so disappointed in me. Do you think your parents are disappointed in you? Sometimes. CORA: That must make you sad. Or angry. - Both. - CORA: Sure. I know. 'Cause no matter what you do, you'll never be good enough. Or straight enough. Or man enough. Or woman enough. It's like you're nothing... to them. You're not even a freak. You're nothing. So what do you do? You try to make yourself special. So they'll see you. So they'll notice you. So they'll love you. You become... they. Honey, that's not gonna work. This thing you invented, it's a fake. They're never gonna love you. No one is. Not unless you drop this nonsense and admit what you are. A scared, lonely, ugly little dyke. Our time's up for today, Jordan. Have a good night. (DOOR CLOSES) This one yesterday. And this one. Look how cute he is. Yeah. - This one. - KIM: It's so sweet. It is, right? You OK? Hm-hmm. Lady Macbitch give you a hard time? Hm-hmm. You sure you're all right? Do you ever wonder... you know... how we are? How we present ourselves? How true that all is? All these masks? We need the masks to protect ourselves. But, I mean, are we... are we choosing all this? Do you think we are? No. Sometimes. All my life... (SIGHS) ...I've been different. Not this, not that. Just this other thing. Me. You're still you. I've been fighting to be me for so long. I'm tired of fighting. I just wanna be. Listen... I understand, but... what choice do we have? This is us. I wish you could be kinder to yourself, Jordan. You're so mean when you talk about yourself. Change the voices in your head.

(MAN COUGHS VIOLENTLY) - (SIGHS) - (NEARBY BANG) (GIRLS LAUGH) (GASPS) (SMASHING CONTINUES) Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today we're gonna shake it up a little bit. Boys, you come with me and Zane. Girls, you go with Sarah. Enjoy this beautiful morning. It's a great day to be alive, isn't it? Come on, Duke. Come on. Let's go, boy. - Let's get out of here. - See ya. Come on, ladies. This way. - He's sick. - What? When our dog got sick, he walked like that. So sad. I hate to see animals in pain. I have a new dog now. He's a dachshund. - Miniature, of course. - Of course. Now, don't laugh. I know, I know. I look like homemaker Barbie. Barbie was never that hot. Today we're gonna be exploring traditional gender roles. By behaving in a certain way, by learning to recognize and accept modes of societal behaviors, perhaps we'll come to appreciate the emotional value in reinforcing these behaviors. Even finding comfort and a sense of community within them. So, ladies. Let's make a pie. (CHUCKLES) OWEN: OK. Listen up. Two things control this world. Biology and history. I know this is not a popular thing to say nowadays, but men have naturally evolved to be larger and stronger than women. There's a reason for that. Our forefathers were hunters. They had to chase down game and subdue it. They hunted or they starved. It's in our DNA, gentlemen. We're meant to be killers. This is our biological imperative. And no amount of civilization, no amount of progress, no amount of liberal humanism can alter that genetic truth. You can't argue with science. And science tells us that we are meant to pass that necessary DNA down through the bloodline, through women, through impregnating women and having children. That is science. And that is history. So... Who's got the killer instinct? - Oh, amazing. Good job. - Thank you. Oh, that's beautiful, Kim. Really exceptional work. - Good for you, honey. - I bake with my mom. That's great. You know, I did that too. Oh, you've got a bit of flour on your chin. There. That's better. What is that lipstick? It is so pretty. - Um, uh, it's, like, coral. - Oh. From the mall. Will you let me borrow it sometime? Hey. What do we do with all these pies when they're done? Why, we serve them to the boys, of course. Serve them as in wait on them? Oh, a little domesticity won't kill you, dear. CORA: Molly! What are you doing here? I'm sorry. I was just... just wandering. Well, this place isn't up to code. It's not safe. OK. Sorry. You are with the program, right? Yes, of course. I knew you were family. (CHUCKLES) Come along then, dear. (GUNS FIRING) Alexandra. Girl vs wild. - You've done this before. - Oh, yeah. Once or twice. Between drag shows, you know. How about we make it more challenging? How about a little contest, you and me? - You bet. - Hold your fire! Move those two back ten feet. Give us clean targets. JORDAN: I'm guessing you're pretty good with firearms. Oh, yeah. Well, me and my dad used to hunt a lot. I wonder what that's like. Being hunted. Knowing no matter what you do, you're gonna die. 'Cause your opponent's bigger, stronger, and smarter than you are. Oh, and better looking. - Best out of four? - Sure. Well, come on, baby boy. Show me what you got. No, no, please. Ladies first. (QUIET CHUCKLING) Girlfriend, you better! (ALL LAUGH) - TOBY: I'll be damned! - ALEXANDRA: It's hit! It's hit! - (CHEERING) - Good shot! Come on! (EXHALES) Junior marksman three years running. Or marks person, I should say. Well done, Jordan. You are constantly surprising me. Get over it, Zane. He beat you fair and square. They. That's right. My mistake. OK. Gather round. Now, shooting paper targets is one thing, but it's not the biological imperative, is it? Shooting flesh, ripping flesh, eating flesh, that's our genetic programming, gentlemen. So, who is gonna live up to our great ancestors? Where's my killer? I'm not really sure you did your best. I'm sure. I didn't. OK, ladies. Nice work today. And now, you actually have a bit of unscheduled free time before dinner. Enjoy yourselves. (CHUCKLES) Kim, can you stay for a minute? Go ahead, Veronica. I think we owe ourselves a taste, don't we? Just one little slice. We'll share to save on calories. (CHUCKLES) Oh. It is just so lovely. I hate to cut it. You're lovely too. Just like your pie. Perfectly formed. Nice and warm. Curvy outside. Juicy inside, I'll bet. Taste? Go on. I'm... not really hungry. I am. Mmm. It's just like I dreamed about. I dream a lot. What do you dream about, Kim? (GASPS) Oh, what's the matter, dear? (CHUCKLES) Where's my killer? Who's a man here? Who's gonna step up and be worthy of his sex? Who's got some fucking balls? Toby? Step forward. - Shit. - Oh, come on, Mr. Sondheim. Nothing to be scared of. You trust me, don't you? You see old Duke over there? Shoot him. Look. He's got cancer. He's in a lot of pain. Put him out of his misery. - No way. - You're doing him a favor. Look at him. He can barely walk anymore. No. OK. This is how this is gonna go down, boyfriend. You're gonna shoot old Duke, or Zane is gonna take that sledgehammer, and he's gonna break one of his legs. Then he's gonna break the other leg. He's gonna torture that poor old dog, and you're gonna watch. And old Duke is gonna bleed out all over the fucking place and howl like the devil because he doesn't know what the fuck's going on and he can't move because both of his legs are broken. Are you gonna let that happen? Are you gonna let him suffer like that? Raise your riffle! Raise it! - Don't miss, though. - (TOBY SNIFFS) Don't make him suffer. One shot. Head or heart. Head or heart. Head or heart. Pull the trigger, you fucking queen! (WAILS) Be a man for the first time in your fucking life! - Do it! Be a fucking man! - (YELLS) (GUNSHOT) (CRIES OUT) (TOBY SOBS) There's my killer. (SIGHS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Ooh, I'm gonna tell. You were supposed to turn in all your narcotics. (SIGHS) That bitch... had her hands all over me two seconds after you left. While she was complimenting my pie. Oh, fuck. - You OK? - Yeah. Kim, we've gotta do something. - Like what? - We have to tell someone. Like they don't already know. She's nothing but a fake. Just like I am. (SNIFFLES) I am trying so hard to be straight. I want this to work so bad. (SOBS) - But it isn't. - Kim... Kim, it's all right. Look at me. Look at me. A strong, smart girl like you shouldn't be trying to make other people happy with some... pretend life. You're more than what people want you to be. So you're gay. Big fucking deal. Kim, I don't wanna be cured. Thing is, I'm writing a piece for my college paper about how fucked up gay conversion is. I'm so sorry I lied to you. I keep expecting Jason Voorhees to come out of these woods. Who? ALEXANDRA: Toby, you're not listening. TOBY: I hear you, but... What are we supposed to do? We're fucking trapped. ALEXANDRA: No! I'm not gonna sit here another hour. I'm gonna walk my ass into town and get the fuck out. TOBY: It's a long way through the forest, and it's almost night. JORDAN: She's right, Toby. We have to get out of here. This is only gonna get worse. We're gonna take their bus tomorrow morning, early, before everyone else is awake. What about Stu and Gabriel? Stu? You wanna bring frat boy Stu? Honey, he's practically my fiancé by now. OK. We'll wake the boys up just before we go. Same with the girls. They wanna come, they can. Their choice. But for tonight, don't do anything that'll get you noticed. Just keep your head down and... and no matter what happens, before dawn, we go. (EXHALES) - Is it cold? - STU: No, it's good. You wanna be alone? STU: No. - You look like a girl. - No, I don't. Wait. Not here. (♪ "DREAMING OF YOU" BY CIGARETTES AFTER SEX) (MOANS) (MOANS) (SONG END ABRUPTLY) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) So... Fuck. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I know I should feel guilty, but... Do you? Fuck, no. I'll feel guilty tomorrow. Maybe. (CHUCKLES) What about you? Do you feel bad? - Not at all. - But... you don't wanna be gay, do you? I wanna be exactly what I am. In this life of ours, you have to know what you are. There's so many labels now. Gay, bi, queer, trans. But there's only two that really matter. Predator and prey. I know what I am. What are you? Time to find out. I'm very disappointed in you, Stuart. I had such high hopes. Thought he was gonna be the one. No, I knew. What is this? Gabriel is our little forbidden fruit, if you'll pardon the expression. Someone always wants to take a bite. - You did this on purpose? - So did you, honey. No, you know what? Fuck this. Seriously? With some students, a more advanced therapy is needed. Zane went through it and look at him. Straight as the day is long. No, he's a fucking sadist and so are you. Oh, not at all. Come on. I wanna show you something. Come on, come on. Do you know what aversion therapy is? Have a seat. Come on. Sit down. It's OK, it's OK. Relax, relax, relax. Aversion therapy is a kind of medical procedure that teaches people to not like the things that they think they like, things that they know are bad for them, like smoking, or overeating, or... fucking boys. Jesus Christ! - Shh. Quiet, quiet. Easy, easy. - (GRUNTS) - Let me go! - Won't do any good, bro. Trust me. I've been there. Now, it's true that this procedure requires a little discomfort. But, in the end, you will be the frat boy that your father expects you to be, and you will be the man that you want to be. That's what you wanted, right? To be normal? Hey, look at the bright side, Stuart. In my grandfather's day, you'd be on a lobotomy table. That's how we used to treat people with your condition. I don't have a condition. I'm just fucking gay. Well, we'll soon see about that. (MUFFLED GASPS) Big picture, Stuart. Look at the big picture. You have a chance right now... to change your entire life. (WHIMPERS) No more feeling like a freak. No more shame. No more guilt. Just happiness. Just being like everybody else. Isn't that what you wanted? Isn't that why you're here? Trust me. It's easy. Stuart. Stuart. Are you listening to me? All you have to do is look at the screen, and we take care of everything else. And please, just remember... this is for your own good. - (CRACKLING NOISE) - (MUFFLED GASP) (WHIMPERS) - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) - (MUFFLED SCREAM) (CRACKLING STOPS) (WHIMPERS) You need to look at the picture, son. Come on. Come on, Stu. It's OK. Good boy, good boy. Come on. Take a look. Take a look. - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) - (MUFFLED SCREAM) (CRACKLING STOPS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) (DOOR SLAMS OPEN) - What the hell is this? - We got a situation. Jesus, what happened to him? He'll be fine. He just needs to rest. Looks like he needs to be in a hospital. Take it easy. Jesus. This is bullshit! This whole place is crazy! Close your mouth, woman! You are an employee here! And you will do what I tell you, or you will get the fuck out! Don't you dare threaten me. And you don't need to fire me. I quit. I am taking this boy to the hospital and then going straight to the police. - Easy, honey. - I am not your fucking honey. And if you think the police are gonna let you torture kids, you are sadly mistaken. Do you think folks around here give a hoot about a bunch of pervert kids? I am a man of respect here! I'm on the goddamn chamber of commerce. Now, you get this kid stabilized. And tomorrow, you're gone. (DOOR OPENS) - Hey, Cora. - Hey. How did it go? - Like always. - Oh. Did he resist you at all? Hell, no. He was super horny. He got a little hurt in the chair, but he'll be fine. - Just one. - Come on. Gabriel! - Please. - You are such a bad boy. Just don't let Owen see or I'll never hear the end of it. (DOOR CLOSES) (LAUGHTER) - ZANE: Your laugh. - SARAH: Look at that. Oh, God. - ZANE: What is that? - SARAH: Why?

I need you to stay together. - Go back to your cabins. - Fuck that. We need to get out of here. Don't you have a sat phone? It's gone. The sat phone is gone. - Give us the guns. - You have the rifles. I'm not giving firearms to children. And you need to be quiet! - And do what I tell you to do. - No. No more. You're not telling us what to do anymore. Stop it! All of you. Owen, get the bus. I need to stay with Stu, but we can get the others out. - Where is he? - He's in the infirmary. He was hurt. Toby, wait! Two rifles. One for me, one for you. Everyone, go get some warm clothes on and meet back here. Fast as you can. Stay together. Go! (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) Don't turn your back on them. You think one of the kids did this? All the counselors are dead. Open your fucking eyes. They're not the angels you think they are. (SCREAMS) (SOBBING) ALEXANDRA: I am not waiting around for that psychopath to show up with the bus. No, ma'am. I'm getting out of here. I will fucking walk. - You really gonna walk? - Hell, yes. Can you take them with you? It's gonna be safer if you're together. We need to get them out of here. I'm gonna stay here with Toby and Stu. Alexandra, are you up for this? They're scared, and it's a long way to town. Honey, please. I'm a Black transgender woman. - I could do it in heels. - My password is 0131. As soon as you get in cell range, call the police. All right, kids, time to go. Come on. Right now. Step up your pussies. Stay close to Mamma. Come on. All right, stay close to me. You guys go to the infirmary. Stay there. Don't leave. I'm gonna get that damn generator working, and I don't trust Owen and Cora. You go ahead. I'm gonna go get the rifles. - No! - This isn't over. You know that, right? You go on ahead. I'll be right behind you. Do either of you know how to shoot? BOTH: Yes. Of course you do. OWEN: Cora! Where are the goddamn rifles? Cora! (OWEN GRUNTS) You don't remember me, do you? So many kids have been through here, how can you be expected to remember them all? - Molly, I... - Oh, no. I'm not Molly. Molly's dead in her car on the way here, so I could take her place. My name's Angie. Angie Phelps. Do you remember her? Stay down! No? Angie Phelps. Nothing? She was only 14... when you first met her. She was a good girl... then. Before all this, before you put her in that chair and burned all the good out of her. - You must understand... - No, I mustn't. No more words, Owen. No more speeches! When Angie left here, it was the suicide attempts, and the loneliness, and the self-hatred, and pills, and the doctors, and, oh, the anger, so much anger. I woke up one morning and realized... my soul was just hollow. But you know all about that. That's what you do to people. To children. You hollow them out. And when all of this comes out, in the news, on TV, all of the bodies, all the horror of it, no one will ever send their kids to a place like this again. And you, and everyone like you, will be burning in hell right next to me. (STRAINS) Stop. Get off her. (CHOKING) Easy now, buddy. You know what to do, Jordan. Do it! Shooting a sick, old dog is one thing, Jordan. But shooting a man... No, sir. I mean, that takes a certain kind of heart. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. Oh, I know everything about you. I know you're scared. I know you want this to end. But not like this, son. Not like this. Jordan, you saw the pictures. All those kids. All that torture. You know what he does here. End this now! You're strong enough to do this, Jordan. No. I'm strong enough to not do this. (YELLS) (GROANS) All I did was make those kids into who they wanted to be. You made me too. And this is my truth. Respect. Renew. Rejoice. Revenge! It gets easier. You'll see. There are so many camps like this. We can cleanse them all. (DISTANT POLICE SIREN) OK. So, what are we gonna tell them? We can say he... did it. - He killed them and we... - Enough. No more lies. Where does it end? When every camp like this is closed. When we've killed them all. We could do that, Jordan. You and me. You can try to stop me, but I'm going to go to my friends now. We're gonna leave this place and never look back. And no one is ever going to tell us who we are ever again. Not him. Not you. No one. I'm trying to save you. No one needs to save me. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - Can I go? - Are you family? Yeah. He is. So, back to the real world now, I guess. What are you gonna tell your parents? We'll tell them together. What about you? Get emancipated. Live my life. You live your best life. Always.
