Do you have any interoffice envelopes? Sure. Oh, thanks. Ronnie says you guys are going to Henry's tonight. Well, they are, but I'm not. Why not? A whole bunch of us are gonna go. It'll be fun. I've got a term paper due Monday. You have to work on Friday night? I don't know. We'll see. Oh. Amanda. He is so cute. -Kenny? -Yes? [SCOFFS] Kenny.

Talk to you later. PAMELA: Yeah. You're right. This afternoon. What? [SCOFFS] John, I told... DONNA: I'm not happy, Hayden. Why not? You know what day it is Tuesday? Hmm, let me guess. It's your birthday. I'm gonna be 30 years old, and this is not where I wanna be. How about Rome? Paris? Hey, you know I'm nuts about you. You know what's even better? You're crazy about me. I'm crazy. And we have a great relationship. We have fun together, we respect each other, we admire each other. Hayden, if we have such a great relationship, why aren't we ever together? Why are you out every night? I'm not out every night. Donna, what do you want? I mean, what do you need? I need a future. No, you need to get married. I would like to get married, yeah. That's what people do who are in love. You make it sound like a crime. I would like to believe that you're not gonna take off if things get a little tough. Right now, I can't even get mad at you because that would give you the excuse you need to bail out. Oh, so you want me to make a commitment so what we could fight? You know what I'm talking about. Hayden, I don't like myself right now. You mean a lot to me. But we can't go on like this. How do you wanna die, Henry? -Uh... -You ever think about it? In a hotel room in Las Vegas with mirrors on the ceiling. -Singing with the Temptations. -Yeah? How about, uh, hitting a 30-footer... [GRUNTING] At the buzzer! I'm not gonna die. Yes, you are. No, not till I have a kid. Yeah. So, what's bothering you? Nothing. Oh, come on. It's Donna, right? She's on my case again about getting married. So why don't you marry her? I don't know. I guess I love her, but I just can't see myself married to her. Well, who can you see yourself married to? I wish I knew. Oh, no, you just like running around too much. Henry, if Donna was right for me, I wouldn't touch another woman. Okay, so end it. Well, I'm just not sure that she's not right for me. I know she's not perfect. Listen, I think Donna's great. Yeah, well she is. She's wonderful. She's bright, she's ambitious, she's got a great body. But she's a little short. [HENRY SNICKERS] And, you know, she's getting a little too chummy with that French vanilla. Oh, man, you've driven her to ice cream. She has absolutely no interest in sports. Hey, she'd make a great mother. [SIGHS] You know what would be great? If I could take the best parts of Donna, her brains, her warmth, and then mix them together with Karen's sense of humor. -You remember Karen? -[CHUCKLES] Yeah, that would be great. And she should look like Lisa. [LAUGHS] Lisa was a tramp. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just keeping my options open, just in case I do find her. Yeah, but while you're keeping your options open, what happens to Donna? Please, Henry, your marriage lasted seven weeks. Hey, I made a mistake. I ended it. I didn't lie to her. So Kim said that she and her friends were coming to the bar tonight, right? Yes, Ronnie. For the third time, yes, that's what she said. And she also said that Amanda was gonna be there, right? Yes. Ronnie? What happened? What do you mean? What happened where? Here. Notice anything different? No. No, thanks, I'm not hungry. You know, I spent half the night cleaning this place up. I mean, what happened? I guess Tom got home early. Hi, guys. Yeah. What is it? What are you doing? I'm working. What's it look like? Feel like taking a break? [EXHALES] No, not particularly. Kenny, I think you need to take some time off. I mean, you work too hard on that thing. You really do. Get to the point, will you, guys? [CHUCKLES] We're going out tonight, and we just thought you might like to come along with us, -have some laughs. -And some sodas. You guys just want me to go so I can drive and you can get blitzed. Forget it. I know you. We thought you might say something like that, so what we did is we came up with a little incentive program for you. If you do this for us, we're gonna keep this house clean for a week. I mean, we're talking spotless here. A week? You guys can't even keep it clean for a day. How are you gonna do it for a week?

Hi. -Hi. -I'm Barbara. I'm Pete. -Can I buy you a drink? -Yeah. Thanks, Pete. Bartender? [LAUGHING] What's so funny? The Band-Aid over your wedding ring. Do you actually think you're gonna fool anybody? No. No, I thought it was a dumb idea, but this guy insisted. Nice talking to you, Barbara. I thought you were gonna buy me a drink. It doesn't bother you that I'm married? No. [CHUCKLING] What's the matter? What's wrong? Pete? Oh, Barbara, it's been very nice talking to you. I've got to go. Henry, this could be the one. -Yeah? -Yeah. This girl is beautiful, she's smart, she knows sports, she's successful. She's everything. She's everything that I'm looking for. How does she feel about you? I'll let you know in the morning. Hi, Pamela. I'd like you to meet my brother, Henry. Henry, this is Pamela Ahlberg. -Hi. -Hi. Nice to meet you. -Yeah, you've got a nice club here. -Ah, thank you. So, Henry, can I trust this guy? Yeah. Good answer. -You ready? -Yeah. Nice to meet you. Heartbreaker. -Excuse me. -Julie. Peter. What a surprise. What are you doing here? I just stopped by for a drink. Oh, yeah. Me too. I had no idea it was this kind of place. No, me neither. Is Jack here? No, he's out of town this week. Had to go to Boston. Oh, right. Yeah. -Is Laura still in Denver? -Uh-huh. You know, she had that reunion. Oh, yeah, she mentioned that. [CHUCKLES] Well, uh, I'm heading for home. Yeah, yeah, me too. -Say hi to Jack. -Say hi to Laura. -Bye-bye. -Bye. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] -Are you all right? -What? I asked if you were okay. Are you? No. Anything I can do to help? Not really. I just had a big fight. With your boyfriend? With my father. Here? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] It's pretty weird, huh? Slightly. Uh, would you rather be alone? No. I need somebody to talk to. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Do you get along with your parents? No. Not really. What would you do if you really needed to communicate and they just couldn't be straight with you? Nothing. Did you ever try? Yeah, once. With my father. What happened? Whacked me right across the room. What did you do? I left. Seems like you turned out okay. I could find you 20 people that think I'm totally weird. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So what do you think I should do about my dad? Show him you don't need him. I can't. I love him. I really love him a lot. And I want him to love me, too. I just wish he would be honest with me. I mean, I wish he'd be honest with himself. You must think I'm pretty grotesque sitting out here feeling sorry for myself. No. Not at all Well, I feel grotesque. Um, look, my friend's inside. She's got the car keys, and I really wanna get out of here. Are you going back in? Yeah, I guess so. You don't sound too thrilled. Well, I have these roommates, and they got hold of this video camera, and they're making rock videos in the living room. [BOTH CHUCKLE] How about I buy you a drink? That'd be nice. Okay. Oh, yes. [SIGHS] [SCREAMING] No! Hi, Chris. Hi. Sam, was it? You mind if I share your viewing spot? No. I'd just like to apologize for the way I acted down there. I shouldn't have interrupted you guys. So, you're a travel agent. What agency do you work for? I have my own agency. I'm in the travel biz myself, sort of. I'm a pilot. I fly 747s to the Orient. Oh, I used to fly those routes all the time before I had my son. I probably flew with you. You've got a kid, huh? Yeah, he's six. A real good one, too. You? I got a daughter. She's here tonight. She's not the one I saw running away from you, is she? Looked pretty silly, huh? Pretty intense. Is that the way you guys always talk to each other? No, not really. It's tough, you know, a guy and a daughter. I mean, since she hit her teens, it's just been, "Clean up your room," "Turn down the stereo," "Get better grades," "Get a job." Not the stuff of a close relationship. You look worried about her. Yeah, I'm worried. She's always been a good kid. She never caused us any real trouble. But? Oh, her grades are slipping, and she's been running around a lot. We haven't seen much of each other since her mother and I split up. When was that? Six months ago. Real angry at me. I think I just gotta leave her alone. -I don't think so. -You don't? I think she's trying to get your attention. I remember when I was a kid trying to get my father to pay attention to me. I did some really bad things. Like what? Like I bleached my hair blonde because he loved Marilyn Monroe so much. Pretty silly, huh? Yeah. You're the most important man in the world to her. Chris, would I be being rude again if I left you here and went down to talk to her? No. I hope it works out. Thanks a lot. Chris, I'd like to ask you something. What? I can't do it. What? Do you have a business card? Why? Planning a vacation? No, I... I would like to call you. I would like to take you out. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm gonna make a fire. This place is terrific. Yeah, I like it. Excuse me. No! Don't turn on the water, please. Why? What is it? Uh, I dropped my wedding ring down the drain. If you turn the water on, it'll wash it right into the river. It's probably stuck in the trap here. It's probably already in the river. See? I bet it's right in there. She's gonna kill me. All we gotta do is take the trap off. I'll go see if we can round up a pipe wrench. You think you can get it out? No problem. -Stop worrying. -Uh-huh. -Stay calm. -Uh-huh. -Guard the sink. -Uh-huh. -I'll be right back. -Uh-huh. Oh, excuse me. What's going on? Hi. I left my car back in the parking lot. You'll have to drive me over and pick it up. You know, we can do that in the morning. I like to wake up alone. You know, I really want to stay with you tonight. Not tonight, Hayden. When? I don't know. I'll call you. You'll call me? What does that mean? It means it was great. That's all. So, that's it? One night? Well, you make it sound crummy. I'd rather say we met... ...and we had fun. Fun. You know, I've met a lot of women in my time, but I've never met anybody like you. You're it for me. You met me tonight, Hayden. I don't care. I knew. I knew the moment I saw you that you were... you were the one. You have every quality that I'm looking for in a woman. It wouldn't work, Hayden. Well, why not? Because we're not right for each other. Well, how could you say that? I mean, you're perfect for me. I couldn't design a better woman. Hayden, you've dreamed this up out of thin air. You can't possibly mean what you're saying. But I do. I mean, I think we'd be great together. Don't do this. Why don't you just come back to bed, and we can talk about this tomorrow? Don't make me say this. Have you been to Wong's? Hey, it's this great Szechuan restaurant. We... Hayden, I don't want to get involved with you. Why? Just tell me why. Because you're not what I'm looking for. [SIGHS] -But... -Don't take it personally, Hayden. You're a very nice guy. You really are. I'm just very, very picky. But what's wrong with me? I mean... Hayden, just take me to my car, please. Okay? I'd better get dressed, then. I think you'd better. You know, this is kind of funny. In a sick way. Let me get the... Hey, you want to go out and have a drink? And I'll be out in a few minutes. No, no. I want to help you find the ring. Actually, you're getting more in the way than you're helping. Oh. Oh, uh... Okay. I'll, uh... I'll be out at the bar. Okay. Okay. -My name's Peter. -Oh, Kenny. -Kenny. -Nice to know you. Thank you. Kenny, you'll... you'll let me know as soon as you find that ring. You'll be the first to know, I promise. I'll let you know. Okay. JAMIE: Steffi!

Well, I think you're right. You do? You got all the details right. But those aren't the real reasons that your mom and I split up. I think it's important that you know that. Our love affair ended a long time ago. It did. It just took us a while to figure it out. See, when we got married, we were just kids. We were your age. And we had our little apartment over next to the Air Force base. And before we knew it, we were parents. I didn't know how to be an adult, let alone be a father. Then when I got out of the service, I went to work for the airline, and I was gone half the time. We just woke up one day and we were married to strangers. The surprise wasn't that we split up, honey, but that we stayed together as long as we did. -Dad, I... -Honey. I got one more thing I want to say to you. Okay. Even though your mom and I will never be together again, she's the best friend that I ever had. I really miss her. It gets lonely in that big house, you know. Without you guys. Which is why I come to places like this and make a fool out of myself. Dad, I didn't mean that. I just said it because I was mad at you. Are you still mad at me? A little. I love you. I love you, too. Well, I have ten days off before I have to leave again. Let's do something. Let's go someplace, just you and me. Yeah? All right. I'm sorry I missed your birthday. Happy birthday.

It's 1:00 a.m. I'm going home or some place. I got it. Oh. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Thank you. Can I buy you a drink? Yeah, sure. Bartender. I'll have a beer, please. That was really close. How long have you been married? Forever. That's a long time. How old are you, anyway? 30. Got married right out of high school. Kind of missed a lot of stuff, you know. I haven't had a lot of experience with women. Lately, I've been... Lately, I've been having these fantasies. I haven't had a lot of experience with women either. I know what you mean about those fantasies. You do? I think about my boss all the time. She kills me. She's really great. She likes you? I don't know. I'm a peon to her. I mean, I become the village idiot in her presence. I can't believe that. It's true. That woman is way out of my league. I don't know why I even came back. I don't know why I came here either. Except that my wife went out of town, which she never does. I ended up here. Spending half the night in the head. [LAUGHING] You know, I am glad that it happened. I love my wife. It's not worth risking our marriage for. You know. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ["THE TRACKS OF MY TEARS" PLAYING] I gotta go. Yeah, I guess I'm out of here as soon as I finish this drink. Good night, Kenny.

You all right? Yeah, fine. I thought you left with that sportscaster guy. Yeah, I did. I came back to get my car. Where are your friends? I took them home. How are you gonna get home? Driving. In your condition? No, you're not driving. Come on, I'll buy you a coffee. Am I drunk? Yeah, you're drunk. You know, I've never been drunk before. Well, you're drunk now. Get in the car. Hey, is this like a date? Yeah, it's a date. Come on, get in the car. Hey, Donna. Oh. It's getting late, child. It's getting late. It's time to boogie. For all you good folks that have got somebody to go home with, and for all you folks that are going home alone. But remember, it may not be a bad idea to go home by yourself. [CHUCKLING] [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Back so soon? Donna left me. What do you mean she left you? She left me. She moved out of the house. She packed up all her stuff. She left me a note. She took off. How do you feel? How do you think I feel? I'm destroyed. That's how I feel. It seems to me Donna took you off the hook. I mean, you met the woman of your dreams tonight, right? Well, she dumped me, too. I'm hurting, Henry. I mean, what am I supposed to do? I don't know. What do you want? What do you really want? I want Donna. Well, that's not what you told me this morning. No, I really want her. All this time I been looking for the perfect woman, and I was living with her. And I didn't realize it until she left. I think your ego's bruised. You want her back, you can be in control again. No, I really love her. You don't want to listen, so fine. Go and talk to her. Uh, maybe you can get what you want. I don't think so. I think Donna's got too much class. What are you being so negative for? Because I'm tired of your act. It's boring. You think I'm acting? I think you feel guilty because you're relieved she's gone. I just came here for a little help. I'm sorry if I bore you. Do you want some help? Grow up. -KENNY: Can I tell you something, Ms. Ahlberg? -PAMELA: Sure. I really think you're great. Some of the other people at work, they call you "iron butterfly." "Iron butterfly"? Mm-hm. But I think you're the best in the company. Well, thanks, Kenny. That's high praise, coming from you. How old are you? 22. Is this your first job since you got out of school? Yeah. What do you have planned for yourself in the company, Kenny? Hm? Vice president? President. I like that. Do you live alone? I have thousands of roommates. You have a girlfriend? No. No? I saw you talking to Kim at the bar. I spoke with her. I think she's nice. She's okay. I'm gonna get some more coffee. You want some? Yeah. I'll have some more coffee. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Kenny? Kenny? -Are you all right? -Yeah. All right, come on, let's go inside. Wait. Wait, Mom. Wait. Dad wants to talk to you. I have nothing to say to him. -Yeah, I do want to you talk, Jackie. -About what? Just take a minute. Just listen to him, okay? I love you. -Jamie, this is ridiculous. -Just talk to him. Well, what is it you have to say to me? [SIGHS] Well, I had, uh... quite a talk with Jamie tonight. She's very wise. She, uh... [CLEARS THROAT] She made me think about... ...myself... ...and our marriage. I'm sorry, Jackie. I realize that it's too late to make any difference, but I just have to tell you... ...that I'm sorry. Oh, Sam. Do you want to go upstairs and, um, have a cup of coffee? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to do that. She is not here. Have you talked to her tonight? I talked to her. Did she tell you she was moving out? I've been telling her to do that for months, but I didn't think she had the guts. Look, I saw her car out there. -I just want to talk to her for a second... -Get out of here! -I want to talk to her for a second. -It's all right, Betsy. I'll talk to him. I've thought about this for months. My mind's made up. I want you to come back. No. Please go. Will you just listen to me for a second? I couldn't believe you left like that. I've been warning you. You don't listen. I know I have been a jerk, and I'm sorry. And I understand why you left. I didn't realize it till tonight. I really love you. I don't wanna hear this. I want to make a commitment. Before I would have given anything to hear you say that. But you've lied to me so many times. -I don't trust you. -I'm not lying now. I swear. I don't think you're capable of an adult relationship. You want me because you don't want to be alone. But you also want to come and go freely. You can't have everything. I'll do anything you want. It will be the same story all over again. Hayden, I deserve better than that. Just give me one more chance. It's too late.
