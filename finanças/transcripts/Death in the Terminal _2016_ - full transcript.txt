Radio Darom you can hear you're home "Red Hot Mediterranean Music" with Nir Vaknin! It's the first day of the week, and time for another "Red Hot Mediterranean Musis" program. I'm here with you, at the mierephone, for the next two hour^. Two hours of Mediterranean miSsic that'll get you up and daijeimg. So now's the time, my friends, to turn the volume up on your receivers, in your car, at work, or wherever you might Ise. I got to the central bus terminal at 7:15 pm and met a friend from the army base. He had just arrived from Pardes Hanna, from home, and we went to catch the last bus to the base at 8:25 pm. So we get to the central bus station and we're waiting there and I needed to go to the bathroom. I told him, "Let's go to the bathroom" and he said, "Sure, I've got to go, too." We're walking towards the bathrooms. And then... We come out of the stalls, adjust our pants, adjust our belts, in order to go out you have to tuck your shirt in, so we're making ourselves presentable to leave the bathroom. Right then we hear a number of shots fired. I immediately understand it's gunshots because I can also smell the gunpowder and... The boom is so loud that it... It was really close to the bathroom. The bathrooms are in a closed area, and there's this boom that doesn't stop ringing in your ears. Boom! Boom! Very frightening. There were a lot in the beginning. Those were the first shots that hit the soldier. I knew it was a terror attack, I went into the bathroom, I locked myself in with him, inside the bathroom. And I told him: "Be q,uiet, don't say a ward. "Put yeur phene eh vibrate and den't say a word. "Letts wait it out and see what happens." And he went into a sort of shock, he was... Sort of... like, you know, shook... Not paralyzed, he's answering and everything, he understands me, he switched off the phone, but not... The look on his face was like, "Wow." I mean, I'm also like, "Wow," I wasn't expecting gunshots. And... I told him: "Be quiet." A few minutes pass and it's quiet outside, no gunshots. I say to myself if it was a terrorist, he would've struck already, he would've made noise. There was no sound in the bathroom. I go outside... The moment I step out I see a soldier, I don't leave the bathroom, I step out the stall door, and head towards the turnstile at the exit to the bathroom. And at the turnstile itself, if this is the turnstile then here is the soldier's head. Right at the entrance, you can't even get out. If you tried to get out, you'd have to step over him. -On the floor? -His head is here, on the floor. A bullet here... His whole baek is full of bullets. His whole back was full of bullets. And I see half his body because there's a wall blocking his legs. see just half his body, and a pool of blood. And I have to do something. Then I hear gunshots again. So I run back inside. I don't see a terrorist, -f didn't see one throughout the whole incident. I go back inside again. Ben is asking me: "What happened? What'd you see?" I told him: "Ben, there's a soldier there, he's full of bullet holes... You wouldn't believe it!" Just as I'm saying it to you, that's how I told him. "You wouldn't believe what I saw there!" He tells me: "Why are you lying? Where?" I told him: "Come with me, come." e quietly make our way closer... The second he saw him, he froze. That, right then, is where he froze. Then I hear more gunshots, and I pull him back into the bathroom with me. e get in, and we're protected, behind a wall. Nothing ean happen to us. Now, Ben is frozen and I tell him: "Ben, I have to do something to help the soldier. "We'll resuscitate him, we'll do something, We have to, even just to pull him towards us. "Who knows what's out there." The police still hadn't arrived, n® one had. You got it? There's just screams, screams, and gunshots. You're in the bathroom, you don't see what's happening outside. The third time I went out, there's a cop standing right in front me. He's kneeling in front of me, this cop, on one knee, and I see him there. There's a wall across from me, and he's here, and here there's a water fountain in the ©entral station and an ATM and... Ihat's what I saw. At that moment I... I yell: "I'm a soldier! I'm a soldier!" because I see a gun pointed at me, And at the same time that I'm yelling, my arm suddenly dislocates. This arm. What do I mean by dislocated? You know, there are those dolls on strings, where the arm moves like this? Well, my arm was just like that. He just shattered the elbow. This disconnected from here. The whole arm was dangling, like this. Right after getting shot in the arm I feel this intense heat in my stomach, My stomach... it doesn't hurt right away. But heat, heat, heat, heat. saw so much blood coming out of me that I said: Where is all this blood coming from? You know, if you cut your finger, if something happens to you, you bleed and then it stops, but this blood, it doesn't stop and you feel your shirt sticking and clinging and... Thick blood, the blood is thick so... I don't know if it's thick, but you feel this certain dampness, of it sticking and just pouring out... It's, you have to experience it, God forbid... You've got to experience it to understand what you're going through just then. You just see blood and more blood, and you manage to get up and you look at where you were lying and you see what's poured out of you, you can't believe it, you think to yourself: Look at all that blood. I'll probably die. There's no way I'll survive this. No way. It vitas very clear, at least to rjie, what was happening. With the first shots I knew what it was, The dtber employee couldn't understand why I was pulling her into the changing room. Do you remember what you .did at that-exact moment? -Yes. Yes. There were gunshots,, I knew they were gunshots. I.t-s funny, because I didn't feel any stress. I mean, as I'm sitting here talkingjo you... I feel stressed, but it’s like I began to move on autopilot. I didn't feel stress and I pulled^her into the changing noom, and she said: "What happened?", , sb I told her: "It's gunfire." •And she was shocked. I'asked her... To duck down, t® hide in-the changing room, and then she sees me going to leave, and she says to me: "Why are you leaving?", so I told her: "We talked about this already, Fm studying-first aid, I'm a nurse. 'Tm'sure-they need help." I came across the first victim lying on the ground, a gunshot to the thigh. I start to treat him, I try to calm him down because the biggest fear is that when a soldier is panicked he could go into shock. Into shock. It's bad enough that he's bleeding, he's shot. The fear is that he'll go into shock and make the situation much worse. T:hen the gunshots started up again. As I'm yelling for everyon'e to cover the soldier, the first thing running through m^head is... Oh no, there'll be more people injured. Be'caus'e when I went up to~him anti started'to treat him, I said to nrayself... There's one victim, like... Good! I mean, he's lightly injured. What luck... He'll get through it. Maybe acetal rod in his leg and that's it. So after the second round of gunshots, of course, there were more victims. Just as I'm putting on’the gloves, I see, from a distance, that they're bringing ever Omri. Six peeple carried him on their shoulders, they laid him d@wn next to me. I ijnipved over to him. I started... to cheek his pulse over the carotid artery. I'm chicking his pulse over th§»earotid, and I see that there's no pulse. I eheck his brachial arte'py, rand Lsee there's no pulse. And that's the moment I started to panic and I wept like: No, no, no, no, no... It's just, I started to say: "No." This one's alive, that one's alkve. ©kay, at least everyone's ali^e. There is no pulse. The veteran paramedic arrives. I told him: "Start running the show, I'm with you." "Get an Airway tube, get an Ambu bag." "Let's start' resuscitating, count the gujj!slii®ts t® the ehest, start opening up the elethes." And as I'm removing the clothes and counting the gunshot wounds, there were four, one, two, three... four, the fourth rib. I tcgld him: "Four gunshot wounds." He^doesn't have a pulse. I said: "Otan I start chest compressions?" I told him: "I know it's not allowed", because of the bullets, more blood will come out. I told him: "Something? A Defibrillator? "Anything? Can I start to do something? To stop the bleeding? Bandages?" "No. Don't do anything." And I get angry at him and start yelling at him: "But there's no pulse!" And I yell: "Why are you resuscitating'1?! "Everyone knows, there's no pulse, so obviously there's no breathing. What... "VMhat are you resuscitating for?" And he's a veteran, he already knows that. At the same time, Omri starts bleeding from the mouth, and... someone passed by, of course there's panic, the soldiers started yelling: "He's bleeding! He's bleeding!" They're stressed out and I'm screaming at theism: "Get away from the injured! Get away from the injured!" I get a sieve out for the paranngglic. And he tells me: "It's fine, you can go." Something like that. From here, honestly, from here on out I already... I mean, the whole incident... I remember what happened and then from here, when he tells me: "It's fine, you can go," it's like... like, "Give up"... I just remember standing up, and suddenly... ambulances and policemen arrived. I saw that they loaded up... that they'd taken away all the injured people I'd treated, and at the same time, I see that they're taking Omri away. And because you don't give up on a soldier, someone keeps pumping his chest, attempting to resuscitate him, and I hear the paramedic say, "Guys, cojrie on... "Time of death, time of death." Wow, wow, what's going ®n here? We left the prison, Hananya isn't a resident of the city, I am. I know the shortcuts. I told him: "Take a short cut through the central bus station. "This way we'll miss the traffic lights". e headed towards the station and heard a gunshot. A single gunshot. We stopped. I told him: "Stop the car." We stopped there. People are running around hysterically, there's a terror attack inside the central bus station. I didn't think twice, today I can say, regretfully, I didn't think twice, I told him: "Park your car somewhere out the way, "I'm running inside." I started to run inside as people are running out. I run inside, and see the terrorist lying there the security guards and police officers have their guns out, pointed at him. Civilians are kicking him and what n'ot, and I didn't touch him. And after about three, four minutes, there was massive gunfire from the south side, from the direction of the bathrooms, coming in our direction. Everyene started to run. Some ran outside, some ram with their weapons towards the bathrooms, and the tenrerist lay there alone, n® ®ne watching him, no one aiming their weapon at him, nothing. On the one hand, you want to... You're suppose to run, because you've got no weapon, you're unprotected, you've got nothing, you bend down, and behind you is the central station window, which is full of bullet holes. I mean, if you stand up, it's a bullet to the head. You start praying to God, not to get shot. And on the other hand, you want to neutralize the terrorist because now he's moving and maybe he's go something on him, I don't know. From my perspective, he's a terrorist so maybe he's got an explosive belt, maybe he's got a weapon and he's waiting on the other terrorist to shoot before taking it out and firing from behind. You don't know. You think about all sorts of situations, and you've got one second. One second to decide. He started-t® m®ve with his b®dy. The mement I saw him mewing, we took a bench, we put’ it' down oh him. we didn't hurl it at him like they said. We placed it on him, and we jumped bask away from him, to see his reaction, to see if maybe he had something on him; And Pm seared of the gunfire, too which is coming in my direction, and also of him. I don't know, like, who's fighting whom. Then he made a motion like this, with his hands. I came over, I kicked him right here. I kicked him and I sat next to him. I sat down and I told him: "Don't get up." There's still gunfire from the south side, and yelling and screaming that... It doesn't matter what I tell you, whatever I tell you, you won't... you won't be able to understand any of it. -What? Describe it to us. Describe the scene to us. -How can I describe it to you? Imagine I've placed you in a room where there's just screams, blood, gunshots, terrible yelling from all over, and you, the first thing that comes to mind, is to look over at Hananya and to say: "God, just not a bullet to the head. I'll take a bullet anywhere, just not to the head." And at the same time, you... You stand up, you direct police officers here, help civilians there. All of this while risking my own life, without thinking at all about my family, without thinking about anyone, because I came in with the goal of helping however I could. If anyone's severely wounded, I've got a car, I can rescue them. Maybe there's something else I can help with. My duty, as an Israeli citizen, is to go in and help. Set aside the fact that I'm an officer in the Israel Prison Service. My duty is to go in and help, which is all the more true when I'm in uniform, when the Israeli flag's on my shirt. So what, I'm going to run away? I'm going to stay in my car? Drive to the emergency room? I couldn't have lived with myself. Today I can live with myself, although it's hard because of the situation, but if I hadn't gone in, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself. That's even worse. It doesn't matter what happens to me in the future, it's better than having never gone in. I went out to platform 9, I looked around, it was my first time going to Samar via Beersheba. Usually I go via Jerusalem by bus and... I didn't know which platform exactly, they told me number 9, I went outside, I saw some guys waiting around and the bus wasn't there. I asked them how much longer until the bus comes. They told me: "Within ten minutes." Approximately, something like that. I said to them: "Can I leave my bag here? I'm going to go inside "To buy some falafel," I was really hungry. I finished eating and... I had a strawberry banana shake, a glass bottle, I saved it for desert. I started to drink, I drank half. I put the bottle down. In an instant I understood it was a shooting attack. It was as clear as day to me. I immediately get up like this, turn around, stand up, enter through this'opening... And then I see a man on the floor, the terrorist, and around him, a group of people who are... trying to hit him, to... to beat this... this lifeless body. A body... He was still alive, but not really. And even if he was, in my opinion, he must have lost any sense of pain or... or ability to cry out or move because... He moved a bit, he moved like this, he moved this a bit, but a man who's been shot some seven times... he screams, something... Nothing. He lies like this on the floor, eyes open. Dead eyes almost, but he's alive, because from time to time he moves his hand. It's not reflex. He's alive, moving a bit. People hit him, so he puts his hand over himself like this. And... And I even, I mean... I don't even think: "Wait, maybe there's another terrorist. "Forget about him, maybe there's another terrorist." I'm drawn into it, I'm sucked into... into this situation and I... And I'm just... I'm stunned by what's happening there. I don't... I don't believe what's happening there. And I say to people, yell to them, because you can't hear in all the commotion, so I yell to people... I wasn't interested in the terrorist, with all good intentions. He's a terrorist and he needs to die. And... What interested me, what truly interested me... I couldn't... I couldn't move from there. I had to save these people. What do I mean by saving? People... are corrupting, in this very moment, their soul. Corrupting it, completely. I'm saying this and I can't believe they don't get what I'm saying. It's the simplest thing there is. -They didn't hear you or...? Of course they heard me! I was screaming. -Can you repeat what...? I'm screaming at people: "You're animals!" No, how did I say it? I need to hear it again somehow, but... What was it... Savages. "You're savages." A moment before I leave, I look at the... I bend over like this, I bend over the... over him, and I sit like this, looking. I wasn't afraid of him. I bend over him, looking at him like this. And I don't know why, I'm looking and I... Maybe these are just feelings I've constructed in retrospect, after the incident, but I remember the feeling and of telling myself this story. "How can you be a terrorist? You don't look like one!" "You don't look like one!" -You understood that? I didn't understand a thing. That's what I remember that I felt. I said: "He doesn't look like a terrorist! "You son of a bitch." And I left. I know that it's him, right? Because it's him, because they shot him. But it's like.. I felt that something there...I don't know. Something didn't feel right. It didn't feel right, but there are facts. This is the terrorist. But beyond that, not a thing. Nothing. I don't know, something said to me, this doesn't... it doesn't make sense that this is what a terrorist looks like. Then you tell yourself, okay, alright. So what? A terrorist doesn't "look like," a terrorist is a terrorist. And I go outside with this feeling: Wow, crazy... He doesn't look like a terrorist. Crazy. He doesn't feel, to me, like a terrorist. On the same day, I arrived at the station. I arrived at the station, and I look around... it's bursting with soldiers. Full of soldiers. Then this thought passes: Man, if something were to happen here, it would be a catastrophe. Really, it'll be a catastrophe. We go back, and we're talking about the situation in the country, me and two of my employees. We're saying, man, if someone were to come in here... He would do it. If someone manages to get in here... And he could get in, honestly. He could get in so easily. And that's what happened. He got in so easily. I'm working, working normally, working, working... Suddenly, it was around seven-thirty, I hear gunfire. Not a lot, just a few shots. I said, "That's it, it's a terror attack." i come out the store, pull out my phone, and as I get there, see him lying on the floor. As I'm filming, I look... He doesn't really look like a terrorist to me. I'll tell you why. Because I looked around, there's no knife. I look at his feet and he's wearing slippers. A terrorist in slippers? Even in Gaza there aren't terrorists in slippers. I'd never seen a terrorist in slippers. He looked Eritrean, too. Eritreans are Christians, they're not Muslims. I said to myself, maybe he went crazy? It can't be. Now, I'm filming, and right next to him is lying a wounded soldier. Now, when I got there he was already on the floor. I thought, maybe he stabbed this soldier? Meanwhile the attack is happening over there. But this soldier, who injured him? Maybe the police. Maybe the police, maybe the security officer, I don't how he was injured. But it wasn't the terrorist, for sure. I was a 100 percent sure. Because the terrorist shot a soldier and went into the bathroom. And the place the wounded soldier was lying was nowhere near that place. It's like he's sitting in the living room and I'm in the bedroom. He can't hurt me. Okay... -And you're filming? -I'm filming, filming, then stop, and start filming a second video. Don't move! don't move! They threw a chair at him, I saw something that I'll never ferget for the rest of my life. One of the soldiers kicked him, kicked him in the head. I'm telling you, that kick, it just sent him flying to hell... I'm sorry for the language, he just... Kicking 50 kilos and managing t® the body takes a lot of strength. Besides that, he was already down. He's no longer dangerous, no threat at all. And then a female soldier comes in and shoots him? What are you doing? The mam has... 200,000 bullets in him, yeah? They threw... chairs on him, they threw benches on him. That soldier's kick... I said to myself, if all these bullets didn't kill him, then he'll die from that kick. He was shot and he was still talking. Look, he was talking, he was moving, he called for help... I don't know what he did. He wanted to say something. But no one listened to him. They spit on him, threw him around, kicked him. It was a catastrophe. I couldn't shout that he was... That he wasn't a terrorist. I couldn't shout it. I wanted to shout it, I wanted to say it, to come out and shout: This isn't a terrorist! This isn't a terrorist!" But... I couldn't, I said, if you shout that, then you'll get it too. If I was Jewish, I would've shouted it. If I was Jewish, yes, I would've shouted it. But I was afraid because I'm an Arab, so I didn't shout it. But if I had shouted it, I don't know if they would have listened, but at some point people would have... done some soul searching. "You know what... "That guy, he told us he wasn't a terrorist." And he wasn't a terrorist, he wasn't! I knew it from... from the first seconds I knew that he wasn't a terrorist. we heard gunshots. e heard the gunshots, people were running and screaming, and I ran inside. I asked someone what happened, and he told me: "Run, there's a terrorist. Run over there". I had a ton of stuff on me, and I immediately dropped everything and ran towards... into the station. The moment I got there something didn't feel night. The person's appearance didn't look like that of an Arab terrorist, We' look someone suspicious And when I asked thi.e security guard, if he had semething suspieious on him, he said yes, and I leaked around the... areund the Eritrean, and saw that he didn't have anything on him, so I didn't do much, because I had doubts right there and then. In that moment I already understood that it might not be him. That this wasn't really a terrorist. I remember, I asked him a few times: "Are you sure there's something on him? "Are you sure this is the terrorist? He answered me: "Yes. Yes, it's him, it's him." And then I look him over, to check and see if he's got anything, anything suspicious, he didn't have anything on him. Then I asked the security guard again, and I tell him: "I don't see that he has anything on him. Are you sure it's him? "That this is the terrorist?" And he tells me: "Yes." Then we hear a burst of gunshots coming from the direction of the bathrooms. Everyone ran straightaway. Me and a few others, we stayed and ran towards the bathrooms. As we're running towards the bathreems, he shoots. The real terrorist shoots at us. we hide behind the benches so that he won't hit us, and when he stops shooting we run towards him again). We advance, me and a few guys, a few other soldiers. They shout at us: "The terrorist escaped, he's outside." we went outside the station and.. they told us that he's hiding behind the big green garbage bin. we also heard shouts, people saying that he'd run out of bullets. So right there we decided to circle him, a sort of flank, so that he wouldn't have a way to escape. And after a few seconds he came out, and we didn't have a choice so we shot him, because he had.. he had a knife, he was holding a knife, that he was probably going to stab one of us with, so we shot him immediately. You shot him? -Me and others... the police, too, yes. And when did you realize that the Eritrean man wasn't a terrorist? When I came out of the central bus station, the police officer told me: "Go outside, we don't want a massive crowd." I went outside with the driver and... we were in... We were still in Beersheba. we went to calm down a bit, to sit down, to think about what really happened. We went to a store that had a TV, and the Channel 2 news and Channel 10 were already starting to arrive and then I realized it was an Eritrean, that the security guard had shot an Eritrean and the guy I shot, that was the terrorist. At first we thought it was two terrorists, before the news updates started to come in, we thought there were two. Then when they reported on the news that he was an Eritrean, then I realized he was an Eritrean, that it wasn't... That it's just a poor guy who... They ruined his life, they ruined... You could say that... It was insane, what they did to him there. Haiftom (the Britrean) had a really great connectien with peeple. He always smiled, Was happy, nettling bad ever came out of him. He was focused on his work, he thought about his family more than he thought of himself. He didn't like to go to the market and to go out like everyone else. He didn't like to go out. He liked to work and to look after his family. He didn't want to live in the city. So that he wouldn't drink, wouldn't stray from the straight path. He looked out for himself so that he wouldn't go astray. He only worked for his family's sake, not for himself. He wasn't even dressed well. He didn't dress well. He was young, he didn't have a chance to see the world. He left us at age 26-27. The next morning I went back to the central bus station to catch the bus to Samar. And... I get there, platform 9, and I pass through the people and I see newspapers, I pick up a paper and I see my picture on the front-page. And I put down the paper. I walk, I look around and I see bullet holes. And then I notice that there's one hole... there are five holes, or a few, I can't remember how many, holes at the entrance to the station, it's clear to me that these are the bullets the guy shot, and I see a single exit hole. And that's right where I was standing. so... You say a blessing for being delivered from danger... A second or so, you pause... I went back outside and waited for the bus. I've still got the crash-pad and the bag and the same clothes and with the same... the same pants, the same shoes, and I sit down in the same exact spot. And then I... I said to myself: Something has to stop here, I'm not taking what happened here with me. Not anywhere, I'm not carrying it with me. I need to stop it somehow. I said, okay, I have to stop from where it started. I go over and sit by the side, on the right-hand side of the door, where I'd left my bag and crash-pad at the beginning, I sit down... I go like this, open up the zipper, take out a half-empty glass bottle of strawberry banana put it down beside me, sit like this. I open it, finish drinking, pause for a second. I close it. And then in a moment there's noise again, and I put the bottle back again, and that's it. I'm done. I mean, completely. Completely.
