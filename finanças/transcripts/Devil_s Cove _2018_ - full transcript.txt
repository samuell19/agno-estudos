(SOFT FUNKY MUSIC) Once in the apartment, McGann fired shots at McCormick, murdering him and attempting to murder his cousin, Ian Dawson. Dawson fortunately escaped and is now in police custody for questioning. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Jackie. NEWS REPORTER: No more rain, Devil's Cove. I need a drink. (DOOR CLOSES) (INSECTS BUZZING) I got us some booze. Wonderful. That solves everything. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh I don't know. Maybe it's because my husband, who I loved, is now dead. Maybe it's because you killed him and two other guys who did nothing to us. Maybe it's because if I'm lucky, I'm looking to spend the rest of my life in a jail cell all because I helped you. Okay, first of all, nobody's gonna catch us, okay? Is that our plan? JACKIE: Yes. Flee to Mexico? They'll catch us at the border. I got a friend, okay? A man called Patterson. Expert in fake IDs. Check it out. We lose the car, we go up to San Francisco, get some fake IDs, start our lives over. And how are we gonna get to San Francisco if we lose the car? I got friends. Someone will give us theirs. Jackie, are you even aware of how noticeable we are? Even in San Francisco, we're going to stick out like sore thumbs. We're murderers. They won't stop until they catch us. Okay. First of all, nobody's gonna give a shit about those two losers, okay? And second, Rick Duval wasn't exactly a saint. The cops wanted to get him for ages, okay? We did them a favor. If anything, they're gonna thank us. We killed a criminal. It's not like we killed some poor, innocent little person. A what, a what, a what? A baby? What happened to your baby? Jackie! I can't believe you listened to that shit, Toni. The least you could do is tell me the truth. He died, okay? He just died. Just died? Don't you fucking judge me. (SOBBING) Oh what? What is wrong with you? You just killed my husband. JACKIE: He had it comin' How can you say that? Keep your fucking voice down, okay? I can still smell the blood. Yeah? Get over it. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey. It's okay. It's okay, just, don't think about it. Don't think about how you put a gun to his head and you blew his brains out and they splattered all over the floor and there's Rick with a giant hole in his head. You did that, not me. You keep telling yourself that, kid. Don't you play me. I stood by you, I cared for you. I didn't want him dead. Yeah you did. I'm going to the cops. No, what the fuck? No, you're not going to the goddamn cops. No, no. And don't think that you can go to the cops behind my back either, honey. You think the cops are gonna take the word of a little black girl with a criminal record? Your fingerprints were all over the fucking gun. You're in it as much as I am, honey, so quit playing the fucking grieving widow, okay? You're not going to the fucking cops.

(CAR STARTS UP) (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'm Rebecca Lawson with Channel Six News, and I am here with Detective Myers of the Devil's Cove PD. Can you tell us what happened with the murder of Mr. Duval? Well it's certainly the most brutal murder that I've ever seen. Rick Duval's body was completely covered in gruesome stab wounds. Are there any suspects in custody? Right now we're gonna reserve that information to ourselves. As soon as we have something we can share with you, we will. We'll never make it to San Francisco. They'll get us. They'll have the road blocks up. So, uh... What the fuck? You had your phone on you this whole time? - Just quit whining. - They can track us. It's Stan's, I've never used it, we're fine. And what about a motive, detective? Again, this is an open investigation. (PHONE RINGS) I hope you'll respect that. As soon as we can share something with you, you'll be the first that we call. Hello? Brads, it's Jackie. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) What the fuck? He just fuckin' hung up on me. (PHONE RINGS) What the fuck? Asshole. Try Al. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Al. It's Jackie. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Fuckin' assholes. Great fuckin' friends we've got. Shit. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay. I know someone who can help. We're gonna have to go that way. Turn left when we get to the stop sign. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where are we? You'll see. What is this? One of your drug dealer friend's house? - Maybe. - Maybe? Do you not realize we're wanted by the law? Quit whining. Police are chasing us and you're saying maybe? Shut the fuck up, all right? I got this figured out, all right? TONI: Okay well can you at least tell me where we're going? (KNOCKING) What the hell are you doin' here? Hey mom. Great to see ya. Been a long time, huh? Meet my girlfriend Toni. Are you fucking kidding me? The whole goddamn country's looking for you. You're wanted for three murders. I thought it was four. Which one got away? Cops were around here yesterday. Just a matter of time before they're back. Hell, they're probably even watchin' the house. Yeah, yeah, yeah, look. Just give me five grand, give me your car, and I'll piss off out of here, you'll never have to see me again, I promise. You expect me to help you out like I did last time? Spend thousands of dollars on lawyers. Something like that, yeah. (DOG BARKING) What is wrong with you, girl? You killed that Duval guy, didn't you? Yeah. And the other two? Mhm. Thank god your father died before you ever fell pregnant. Shut the fuck up and give me the goddamn money. There is no money Jackie. What, what about the money dad left me? That was used to pay your legal fees. What the fuck? You stole my money? It was never your money, Jackie! You know what you put me through. Please, this cry, cry, cry. And you took my grandson. He was my only grandson. And, and I lied for you, Jackie. I lied. I stood up in court and said what a great mom you were. How you were always there for your kid. And he was always with me, while you were out partyin'. Always you, you, you. And I never told them about all the times you screamed that the baby was ruining your life. Oh god, how he disappeared and you never reported it. I never told 'em how you disappeared and said that you were with the baby and you kept coming back for stuff. But you never came for anything of his. Not his clothes, or his toys. Nothin'. And how you still said you were together and you were gonna start this new life without me. Then his little body was found in the river. (SOBS) I still lied, I said you were innocent. And I mortgaged my beautiful house with every dollar to prove your innocence. (SOBBING) I don't need to hear this shit. Jackie. Is it true that you killed your baby? I need to know. Tell me! I deserve to know the truth. Tell me! Get your fuckin' hands off me. Oh, what, what? You fucking people just cry and cry and cry. I'm trying to get us out of this and you're going on about the death of some kid that happened years ago. Your own son. Did you kill him? Of course I killed him. Why? Because he was irritating me, okay? Now you know, so shut the fuck up. You're a fucking sociopath. Don't call me that. You're a murderer. You're evil! You killed my husband! (SLAPS) (LAUGHING) Oh please, you wanted him dead. You don't fool me, honey. You hated that guy's guts. (GRUNTING) Get your hands off me. Get off of her. JACKIE: Bitch. Goddamn bitch. Get out of here. Just get out of my house. You think you can just come here with your black trash little girlfriend and demand money? Well you can't anymore, Jackie. I am done with you. You are dead to me. (SIRENS BLARING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KNOCKING) DETECTIVE MYERS: Police. Police, open up. Mrs. McGann, open it. We're not letting them in. Toni, get the car and meet me out back, now. DETECTIVE MYERS: Police, open this door! Toni, do it. (BANGING) What the fuck is wrong with you? OFFICER: We're coming in. Get the gun, get the gun. DETECTIVE MYERS: We're gonna break it down and come in. JACKIE: Get the fuck outside. No. DETECTIVE MYERS: Police. What are you doing? I mean, you don't even know how to use that thing. Stop it, Jackie. DETECTIVE MYERS: We're gonna break it down. This has to stop now. Police, freeze! Put your hands up in the air, turn around, bitch. Get your fucking hands off me. Yeah, this isn't your baby you're dealing with now, bitch. Hey mom, guess you don't have to worry about that five grand anymore, huh? Will you get me a good lawyer again, please? Please? I hope you burn in hell. Fucking bitch. There's loyalty for you. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) Miss McGann, do you have any remorse? What is your relationship with Jackie McGann? Was the money worth it? That isn't what we said. Can you tell me what you're doing here at her mother's house? Did you kill three men? Yeah, yeah, of course. Did your husband beat you? Thanks for coming guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get your fucking hands off me you pervert. Shut up, you murdering slut. Get in there. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) Get her the hell out of here. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOBBING) Wait. Help me, Toni. Wait. (COUGHS) Here, take the knife. (TONI SOBBING) Toni, help me. Help me. DETECTIVE MYERS: Okay, so far, I'm not hearing any satisfactory answers. I felt like I had to fight for Jackie because she had fought for me. I need to know exactly who did what. Who was the one who finally killed him? I can't remember. You know what? Now you're really, really pissing me off. And that's too bad because I genuinely wanted to help you. So I'm gonna ask you again. Maybe this time, the message will penetrate your brain, and you will be able to remember. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where's Rick? He pissed me off so I killed him. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Toni? (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Police? I'd like to report a murder. Devil's Cove. Jackie. So Jackie was the one who instigated it. But you were the one who called the cops. This can work in your favor, Toni. I can get you off, but I need you to help me. But what about the others? You can say that Jackie forced you to go with her. You had no choice but to go along. But I need to know who did what. Rick, not now. RICK: Yeah, come on. Please, just, stop. Stop. Stop! You gotta fuckin' realize Jackie's trouble. You don't own me! (SLAPS) You're my fuckin' wife! Well maybe I don't wanna be your wife. (SLAPS) Rick, no. Yes, fuckin' yeah. TONI: Rick, stop. You fuckin' want it. Rick no get off of me, stop. Stop, get off of me! Get off of me, no! No, stop, no! No! You'll never get away from me. Never get away from. (SCREAMING) JACKIE: Oh please, you wanted him dead. You don't fool me honey. You hated that guy's guts. (GUNSHOT) He wasn't a bad person. He just didn't know when to stop. He loved me. But I'm not sorry he's dead. So you killed him? But Jackie started it. But, I, I fired the... Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy. Take it easy. It's okay. Here, have some water. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Look, kid. I know you're not a bad person. And I know you haven't had the easiest start in life. But that's no reason to throw everything away now. If they find you guilty of murder, you can kiss the rest of your life good bye. Even if you're found guilty of just being an accomplice, you're lookin' at a minimum of 25 years. I don't think you deserve that. Now I'm familiar with your late husband, Mr. Duval. He's a bad person. I'm not saying that he deserved to die, I'm just saying that sometimes God just kind of takes things into his own hands. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And Jackie McGann, everybody knows she was trouble. Always has been. I never, for a second, bought that insanity plea of hers. She murdered her little boy because her little boy was in her way, that's the only reason. The whole town knew it. Yeah. (SLOW, MELANCHOLY MUSIC) And we also knew that she's the one that took care of the other two guys. You just happened to be with her. (SLOW, MELANCHOLY MUSIC) Sign it. What is it? It's your statement. I wrote it for you myself. It says that you weren't even in the room when the murder took place, and it says that Jackie held a gun up to your head and forced you to go with her. My hands were all over it, my fingerprints. That's explained in the statement. You were trying to get the gun away from Jackie 'cause you were trying to save your husband's life. Sign it, and you get away, and you get off, scot free. Jackie'll be the one that pays for the murder. Come on, what do you say? Sign it. You took my grandson. My only grandson. Of course I killed him. Of course I killed him. Because he was irritating me, okay? Because he was irritating me, okay? SUZANNE: You took my grandson, my only grandson. (SLOW, MELANCHOLY MUSIC) DETECTIVE MYERS: So I take it you know why you're here, Miss McGann? You got any marijuana? What? Is she serious? I need a fucking joint, Myers. Fine, you got a cigarette? Jackie, there's not gonna be any smoking in here, do you understand? Now are you gonna tell us what the fuck happened in that room? What the fuck do you think happened? The black girl did it, okay? Jesus Christ, I need a fucking joint. I'm gonna make sure that you spend the rest of your fucked up life in prison. You understand me? Oh baby, keep talking dirty, I like it. I like it, I like it, I like it. Patterson, get this trash out of my office. I'm done wasting my time with her, get her out of here. Myers. (KISSING) DETECTIVE MYERS: Get out! (SIGHS) And former convict Jackie McGann was sentenced to life imprisonment today for the murders of Rick Duval, Robert McCormick, and Danny Jones. The verdict was handed down after jury deliberated for just one hour. (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Former convict Jackie McGann has been sentenced to life in prison for the murders of Rick Duval, Robert McCormick, and Daniel Jones. The verdict was handed down after the jury deliberated for only an hour. Killer pool, everyone. Okay, I got 50 bucks that says I can kick your collective butts. I got another 50 to make it 100.
