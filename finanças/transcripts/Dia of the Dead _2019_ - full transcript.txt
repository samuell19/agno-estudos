Sleep tight, my little calabazito... mamá will return... and I will bring with me a better life until we're together again, mijo... dream grande! Thank you so much for the awesome birthday party, papa! You needn't thank me, Chiqui - just as long as you had a good time! Tell me - how's my little calabazito doing on his eighth birthday? Eight feels a lot like seven, papa! Hahaha! I trust that is a good thing! But, listen to me, mijo... I have something important to discuss with you. You do? Sí, I do. Ocho is a monumental age for you. It is? Sí. How so? Now that you are eight, my little hombre, you are old enough to make your first journey into The Beyond! I am? Yes! You are! Oh, papá! Does that mean...? Yes, it does, mijo! You can find your mamá, and help bring her back home to us... where she belongs! No way! I can't wait! Do you think we can find her?! It has never been a question of if, mijo... it has always been a question of when. And, now that you are growing into a fine young man, it is time. But, I still don't understand, papá... if mamá loved us so much... why did she go away? I knew the day would come when you would ask these questions, Chiqui. Sometimes, we do things that aren't easily understood by others. This is part of life. Part of growing up. Your mamá loved you very, very much still does of that, I am certain. But, while she cherished her familia more than life itself, she had a dream! My sweet Julieta held a talent so strong, so insistent, that its bright glow threatened to burn her to ash, from the inside out! Ow! That sounds like some painful talent! Sí, Chiqui. But, what was far more painful than watching the love of my life's light go dim, was knowing that your mamá bonita would let her passion go unfulfilled, and her dream go unrealized.. Because of us! Because of US? But, I loved mamá! What did we do wrong? We did nothing wrong, Chiqui. But, us staying by her side was only serving to drag her down. So, to truly love her... I had to make the difficult decision to let her go. You mean... you KNEW mamá was leaving us? And you were okay with it? Sí, I knew. I encouraged her, even. But, I was not okay with it, because I knew it would leave me lonely, and you, my sweet chico, without a mother. But I knew it was something she had to do, for herself. To be content. To be whole. To know she did everything she could do to honor the tremendous talent she held inside her for all her life. And, whether or not she becomes the legend we know she can be, she will be able to carry on, without regret, and most important without remorse. I'm so confused! Hahaha! That's quite alright, mijo! You're only eight, after all! There will be plenty of time for you to understand the world's great mysteries! If we find her... do you think mamá will be happy to see us, papá? Chiqui... I KNOW she will be! I'm going to tell you something now, but I don't want you get too excited, okay? Uh... okay? Your mother, Julieta, came to me in my dreams last night. She did? Sí. And she asked for you. She did?! She did. She wants you to meet her in The Beyond... and she asks that you perform alongside her, in the Greatest Singer Beyond The Beyond competition, of the Festivale De Los Muertos! The Festivale De Los Muertos?! But... I'm not a singer, like mamá! I can barely hold pitch! She doesn't want you to sing, Chiqui... no, she wants you to DANCE! Oh! THAT, I can do! Hahaha! Entertaining as ever, mi hijo! Papa, what will The Beyond be like? Is it safe? All things will be answered in time, Chiqui. But, for now, you must go to sleep. When your slumber grows restful enough, you will open your eyes in The Beyond. There, I will meet you. And all things will be explained. Wow! Like, an adventure? The biggest adventure of our lives! Now, there's no time to waste - off to bed, little one! Yes, papá! And Chiqui! See you on the other side, mijo. See ya there, papá! I'm coming, mamá... I can't wait to see you! There you are, Chiqui! I KNEW you could do it! Papa! Where are we?! Welcome to The Beyond, mijo! Whoooa! This is it?! Where's mamá?! Let's find her! When the time is right, we will. But, for now, we must find the town of Los Muertos - the legendary capital of The Beyond! Come, mijo! Wow! Look at them, papá! Who are they?! What are they doing?! Where are they going?! They are the residents of this place, Chiqui! They give life to The Beyond - whereas to us, they are the DEAD! The dead?! But... they're moving all around! Sí, mi hijo! The Beyond does not operate by the rules that bind our world! It is the opposite of all we know! The mirror's flip side! So, does that mean... that mamá is... dead? No, Chiqui! Of course not! Your mamá is very much alive and well, I can assure you! But, if everyone here is dead... They may still touch the living! It's one of the very special and magical things about our Day of the Dead celebrations! On this ONE day a year, mijo, the portal between the two worlds opens for all to pass through! The dead may mingle with the living, and the living may mingle with the dead! Is that what mama's doing here? Mingling with the dead? Sort of. Two years ago, our sweet Julieta journeyed to the other side in the hopes of proving she is the very best singer, not only in all the world, but in all The Beyond! How can she do it, papá? By entering the biggest talent competition of her life and emerging victorious! Don't worry! We'll still be able to call mamá by her name! But, first... we must find her! I knew I should've had a cup of Poleo tea before exercising my vocal chords today, Lola! Balderdash, Erasma! You needn't take an elixir to manifest the songs that emanate naturally from your golden pipes! You flatter me, bat - but, flattery doesn't win contests! Especially not one as timeless and epic as the Greatest Singer Beyond The Beyond competition! Forgive me if I seem to trivialize your words, Erasma, but your eventual victory is all but a forgone conclusion, is it not? Well... yes, of course it is! There's no soul amongst the living OR the dead whose talents can compare to mine! And that is why you've been crowned Queen of the Day of the Dead every year, for the past TEN THOUSAND YEARS! Hahaha! Well, since you put it like that, Lola. I do seem rather unbeatable, don't I? Shall I begin celebration preparations for your next win now? Or would you have me wait? Oh, I don't know, Lola. When you've had ten thousand victory celebrations, as I have, they all start to blur together, you know? But, surely you recall last year's party! Ten thousand skeleton mariachis marching down the streets from all points, until finally converging in the town square for a rollicking recital of Deadtown Funk?! Hmm, yes! I DO remember that one! But, I thought it was five years ago? Nope. It was last year. Hm! So, when was the grand Fear medley, as performed by the Death Valley Choir? Then it was ten years ago, Erasma. Ten years?! My, how time flies! It sure does! Ah... well! I'm dead anyway! Let's run through my closing number once more, then we'll stop by the saloon for a nice cup of tea! From the top! Yes, ma'am! And a-one, and a-two, and a-one, two, three, four! Whew! I haven't practiced this hard in ANY world, Fredo! And I thought my old music teacher, Ms. Moody, was tough! If you wanna be the best, you got to beat the best! This competition's no game, girl! It's literally life n' death, y'hear?! Don't you think you're being just a bit melodramatic, Fredo? Melody's just part of it! Ya got to have pitch! Ya got to stay on key! Ya got to project! I'm talkin' bout singin' to the back row, girl! No, I meant... forget it. Exactly! Forget them ghouls down front! Half of 'em won their tickets in a radio contest anyway! They're not the fans! They're not YOUR fans, y'hear?! They're rootin' for ya to fail! They're up close n' personal-like, 'cause they wanna see if you'll fall flat on yer face! But, you ain't gonna give 'em the chance to get no laughs at yer expense! I understand, Fredo. But, with all due respect, I don't think of competing like fighting a war. I see it as interesting, invigorating, and fun! Dios mio! What's They Beyond comin' to?! How do ya expect to become a champion, if ya ain't willin' to pay the price of victory?! The price of victory? Let me tell you about the price of victory, Fredo. Two years ago, I left behind a beautiful little boy and a loving, supportive husband to chase a dream I've had since I was born! I didn't come to The Beyond because I passed away - I picked my spot, and I came of my own free will! I came to compete in the Festivale De Los Muertos' Greatest Singer Beyond The Beyond competition! And I didn't come to be a runner-up I came to win it all! The festival begins tomorrow, the contest is on Friday night, and I am NOT leaving without that title! I'm here to win it all, Fredo! And that's exactly what I'm gonna do! Well, I'll be! What're we waitin' fer?! Let's win this thing! First things first, Fredo - I have to be ready to sing the song of my life on this stage! If I lose... then everything I've done here will have been for nothing... especially the time I've spent away from mi familia! I understand, Julieta! That's why I'm doin' everything in my power to whip ya into fightin' shape, y'hear?! And yer almost there! I mean, ALMOST! What do I need to do to make sure I'm as ready as can be for the contest, Fredo? I've come this far... I don't want to leave any tombstone unturned! That's the spirit, girl! Hold it right there. Can we stop with the girl thing? I'm a woman, Fredo. A strong, independent, talented, professional woman! And while singing has been my one true passion and calling all my life, I'm no stranger to hard work and competition! Let me remind you, where I'm from, I'm the undisputed luchadora champion of the universe! Okay, okay! I gotcha! 'Member, I'm two thousand years old, girl... er, young lady! Much better! And, not only that, but my husband, Diego, and I are the reigning mixed tag team champions of the world! Whoa! This is good news! You got the spirit of a fighter! The heart of a competitor! The pedigree of a champion! I can take you to the top, girl... er... lo siento. Está bien. Entiendo. Say, if I may ask, what's your luchadora name? La Trituradora! La Trituradora! What's that mean? It means The Crusher! The Crusher! Nice! It don't work for our purposes, but I like the idea of it. Whattaya say we come up with a stage name for you, before we enter that competition? A stage name? I hadn't considered it, but okay, sure. Any ideas? Hmm... how 'bout Pulmones de Terciopelo? Velvet Lungs? Are you serious? You're right, it's pretentious. I'll think about it. It'll come to me. I'll think about it, too. Can we run a few more numbers, before we call it a night? Spoken like a champ! Let's try Skull Rain, from the top! Hit it, girl... I mean, miss. Sheriff Tato! I'm glad I caught you! I have news! What sort of news, Pins? BAD news! A couple of living intruders have breached The Beyond! And they're on their way to Los Muertos, as we speak! But, today's the Dia of the Dead, Pins. Anyone can come and go as they please. What have they done wrong? It's not what they've done wrong, Sheriff it's who they are! Alright, then. Who are they? Julieta's family! Julieta? You mean, the luchadora who's been training for two years for the Greatest Singer Beyond The Beyond competition? That's her! Well, they must be here to see her perform! To cheer her on! To provide moral support! Or, to lend an unfair advantage! That's why the rulebook clearly states, on page 313, that no blood relatives of living contestants shall be admitted, unless they've A, died! Or, B, been granted permanent citizenship in Los Muertos! I see... why is that, exactly? Duh! The living draw strength from their loved ones! Always have! Plus, it's the vacation destination rule! The living are like lemmings! If we let ONE human in, they'll ALL want to come! Yes, that'd be a real mess... but, today's the busiest time of the whole year, Pins! My men are all assigned! Our resources are spread thin! I have no available officers to track down and eject interlopers! What about the newbies? You mean Spiff and Henderson? You must be joking! No, I'm not! What better way to get some on-the-job training and prove their worth, than by wrangling a couple of living trespassers? Spiff and Henderson are exactly who you should use! But, those two don't even fully realize they're dead! They're in a fantasyland half the time! You'll never know their worth, if you never put them to the test, Sheriff. Hmm... maybe you're right. What a joint this here saloon is, Henderson! It's always jumpin' off in here, day or night! Sho 'nuff, Spiff! No matter what time it is, we can always bust some moves an' drop some science in here! Keeps the reflexes sharp, uh-huh! Y'know, soon as I volunteered with the sheriff, I knew I'd made the right life decision! Bein' a deputy's for me, I'm tellin' ya! Well, ya ain't no deputy yet, Spiff! Neither of us are! But, we play our cards right an' nab us a baddie or two, we'll get there! Sho 'nuff, we'll get there! Is this the town you told me about, papá? Is this Los Muertos? Sí, Chiqui, it is! Now, remember - you must stay close! No matter what, you cannot become lost! It is frowned upon for us to be here, while tu mamá is competing! Will mamá get in trouble, if they find out we're here? I don't know, mijo. But, WE surely will! So, we mustn't allow ourselves to be revealed! Let's get costumes! Let's go in disguise! That would be a wonderful idea, mi hijo - only, I'm already in disguise! I wear a luchador mask 24/7! I'm known for my costume! Then, why not take it off, papá? Your true face can be your disguise! Ah, but the mask of the lucha is sacred, Chiqui! When we put on the mask, we are transformed! The mask gives us strength! The mask gives us fame! The mask is magical! If we remove the mask, we are regular human beings who can be captured, injured... or worse! Oh, no! Keep it on, papá! Keep it on! There is but ONE way I know to gain access to the Los Muertos festivities and attend your mother's competition, Chiqui! We must find the great EL MONSTRUO! Only his favorable word can grant us the entry we seek! Where is this El Monstruo? How can we find him? El Monstruo exist all around us, mijo! He could be vending from that fruit cart! He could be working at that taco stand! He could offer us a shoe shine, and we would never know it was him! He could be that falling leaf! Or that gust of wind blowing through the tombstones! To see El Monstruo, one must prove that they are good souls, worthy of the cause. And this means we must do two good deeds for the citizens of the town of Los Muertos! Two good deeds?! But, how will we know what sort of deeds will be good enough? How do we choose? Spiff. Henderson. Sheriff Tato! We was just patrollin' this here saloon for any signs o' wrong-doin', sir! That's right, Sheriff! We got our eye on all o' these ne'er-do-wells! Actin' up, they are! Bustin' glasses, hootin', hollerin', an' whatnot! But, don't worry, sir! We'll haul in the proper offenders, lickety-split! I'm sure you men'll do just fine. But, that's not why I'm here. It's not? No. I knew it! We're bein' fired! Gettin' the ax! Receivin' our walkin' papers! Oh, Sheriff! Give us one more chance! We won't letcha down, I swear! That's right! We'll drag half this saloon into the pokey, if'n we got to! Pfft! We'll arrest every last patron here - includin' the piano player! I appreciate your due diligence, men! But, we've got another kinda problem to deal with. Point it out, sir! We'll take care of it! I was hoping you'd say that, Spiff. Seems our town's about to get a visit from a couple of outsiders. Outsiders?! We'll hang 'em high! And bury 'em shallow! Now, men. Let's not overreact. I've heard through the grapevine that the relatives of one of the living contestants in our Greatest Singer Beyond The Beyond are, in fact, here in Los Muertos! Bald-faced criminals, Sheriff! Their days are numbered, sir! Mark our words! As you men know, our law-keeping resources are stretched to the breaking point tonight. So, I'm entrusting this matter to you two. Don't let me down... and, uh, don't overreact, yeah? We're the men for the job, Sheriff! That's right! Ain't no truant relatives gonna evade the long arm o' the law Beyond! Oorah! Spread 'em, grandpa! The two you're looking for are a father and son duo. A team! Are they armed an' dangerous, sir?! Probably not. Dang! If you find 'em, just identify yourselves and explain the situation. Living relatives are expressly prohibited in contests of the dead. I'm sure they'll understand. They better! 'Cause if they don't... it'll be curtains for 'em! Best of luck, men. May the wind be at your backs. Whoa! Can ya believe it, Spiff? We got us a coupla real, honest-to-goodness fugitives! They prob'ly won't go down without a fight, neither! We oughta go outside an' test our reflexes! Good idea! We got to be ready to nab those two on sight! C'mon! Buenas, kind strangers! I'm Tia Pepa! I-I seem to be all turned around! And I can't find my way home! Sometimes, Chiqui, we need only stay the course, and the deeds choose us! We'll help you get home, miss! Come! Describe as much as you can about where you live! O-Okay! There's a great, big clock! That much I remember! A great, big clock?! That should be easy to find! Papa, you walk Tia Pepa, while I keep an eye out! C'mon! This will get us a step closer to seeing mamá! What's wrong, gir... I mean, kid? You been sittin' there, poutin' behind yer mask since we walked in here! Practice was good! Ya sounded great! What's the problem? I just can't shake the thought, Fredo. Listen, you. Everybody loses sometime, ya feel me? It's the ones that never taste defeat that're the real losers! The eternal losers! Oh, it's not that, Fredo. I'm troubled by the thought that, if I don't win that competition on Friday night, all of this will have been for nothing. The hard work... the sacrifice... the precious time away from my baby... Julieta, take this from a two thousand year old mummy - bein' a champion exacts a heavy toll. Lotta folks ain't willin' to pay it, and that's why they never become great. But, you... you already committed to the hard part! You removed yerself! You crossed over! You been livin' it 'round the clock for two years! I'm tellin'ya, gir... Julieta you're as ready as anybody I ever did see! Thanks for the pep talk, Fredo. I just miss my little man so much! It's been so long now, my precious baby Chiqui's gonna be a little man soon! Soon? I got news for ya, Julieta, Chiqui's growing up fast! Soon, he'll be bigger than his papá! No me lo creo! I miss my big man, too! My handsome, strong Diego! Two years... I wonder if they'll even remember my face when they see me again? I betcha you've got a pretty face under that mask, kid! Oh, you're making me blush, Fredo! Ya can't tell. Lemme give ya some helpful advice, kid. I get that you miss your family. Use that! Keep 'em in the front o' your mind! And when you take the stage, that emotion will drive you to achieve all your dreams! I appreciate the advice, Fredo - but, I couldn't get mi familia off my mind if I tried! Look at them over there, Lola! That decrepit mummy actually thinks he has a shot at grooming a new singing champion, while I'M still competing?! He'll be sorely disappointed! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces, Erasma! Tia Pepa, are you sure we're going the right way? I'm not sure at all! Everything looks so new to me, I... I fear my mind is slipping! You may not believe me, but I'm quite a bit older than both of you! No! I don't believe it! Oh, it's true! I'm two hundred and forty three next week! Get out! How do you do it? For my youthful vigor? Spices! And for my timeless glow? Face cream! Huh. I'll have to remember that. What is it, Tia Pepa? Are you okay? Oh, dear! I fear I've gotten us all lost! It's gonna be alright, señora! These conditions aren't great for walking around! This fog's as thick as guisante soup! But, do not worry! As long as we're still in Los Muertos, we'll find your house! Hello, weary travelers. Mi nombre es Momo. Might I interest you in a moment of reflection, to collect your thoughts before moving on? Whoa! Who's he, papá?! Stay calm, mijo. Papa's got this. We're just passing through, Momo! We'll be on our way now! So soon? Most people choose to pause and savor their lives flashing before them, before taking my hand. What's that? Hand cream? Yes, I'll try some! No, Tia Pepa! We don't want any of what this segador is peddling! Wanting has no bearing on our engagement, wanderer. Oh, papá! I'm scared! Stay strong, mi hijo! We're moving on! Yes... you are. And I shall be your guide. Pfft! You'll be nothing! I've seen your kind, young man! Charlatáns! Whipper snappers! We're not falling for it! Now, out of our way! You heard the lady, muerto! Scram! Alas, it is not so easy, mascarado. You have encountered me, therefore I must lead you to your destination. Oh! Well, I'm going home! Do you know which way it is? Of course. Follow me. No, Tia Pepa, don't go with him! Ha! Don't worry about me, mijo! There's nothing this reaper can do to me! It's you that must worry. You must protect yourself and your baby from this creature! Shoo! Go away, creep! Go away! You cannot wish me away, luchador. You can only delay the inevitable. And then, only for so long. Well, consider it delayed! Run, Chiqui! In a straight line, so we are not separated! Look around, Pins! What a Dia of the Dead we're having! Why, I'd go so far as to say Los Muertos is the most alive town of the dead ever! I agree, Sheriff! Have we heard any news from Spiff and Henderson? Have they found the two I warned about? No, I've gotten no word from them yet. Does that concern you? Not at all! It probably just means they've got those interlopers cornered somewhere. Why, I'd venture to say they've probably been banished from our town as we speak! Alright, pardner! Ten paces, then turn and draw! On yer mark! Bang! Yer dead! Me?! Am not! Are too! Am not! Are too! Okay, let's do it again! No do-overs, Henderson! In the real Beyond, ya get one shot, then yer dead-dead! We're just runnin' drills here, Spiff! Lemme limber up, then we'll practice lassoin'! I'm the best lassoer in this town, Henderson! Don'tcha know I won the dead steer wrestlin' tournament thirteen years in a row? I 'member that! But, didja know I'm a former All-Beyond mat wrasslin' gold medalist? No! I didn't know tha... Boom! There is it! This is it! This is my casa! Oh, how can I ever thank you chicos enough? No need to thank us, Tia Pepa! The pleasure was all ours! And the displeasure! That skeleton back there in the fog was one scary guy, papá! Ah, but fear exists only in the mind, Chiqui! Refuse to let it use you, and it will vanish! Then, can we all go home, papá? Together? Sí, mijo! The THREE of us! Pardon me for interrupting, but did I hear you say you're seeking entry to the Festivale De Los Muertos? Sí! Mi mamá is performing in the... uh... what's the competition called again, papá? The Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond! Wherein Chiqui's mother - my wife, Julieta - is going to win the title of greatest singer! That's right! It's her death city! You mean destiny, mijo. It's her destiny! Yeah, that! You boys sound very sure of Julieta's talents! We are, Tia Pepa! My Julieta possesses the silkiest, smoothest, most harmonic, melodic, angelic voice of all time! She is truly a singer for the ages! Well, she'll have to be... for her sake! For her sake? What do you mean? I mean your Julieta will be competing against none other than the legendary Erasma Bones! Erasma Bones? You mean, you mean the Erasma Bones? But, I thought she was dead! Oh, but she is! That's why she performs in residency, here in The Beyond! Hoohoo, what a show! Who's Erasma Bones? Erasma Bones is the oldest, most successful singer of all time, little one! She has received every award there ever was! Shined in every performance ever given! And won every competition ever held, for the past ten thousand years! Including the Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond - which she has never, ever lost! She's never lost?! But, papá... how can mamá beat her? We simply have to have faith, Chiqui. Faith that she can. All right now, look alive, kid. Look alive, he says? I AM alive. In the town of Los Muertos ..that's the problem. No, the problem is you can't stop longin' fer yer familia! And? And, it's ruinin' yer focus! So, I brought ya out here to run some exercises and get yer mind, instincts, and vocal chords back in tip-top fightin' shape! Whatever you think is best, Fredo. That's right! Just listen to ol' Fredo, kid! Now, this is a little unconventional, but yer nothin' if not an unconventional pupil! I'm gonna throw out a line to a well-known song, and I want you to finish it, in key, pitch, and melody! Got it?! Got it. I'm ready! Alright, then! Let's begin! First song... ♪ When you walk along the cemetery's edge, ♪ ♪ Don't you feel alone and blue... ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'll be right there, walking beside you! ♪ Boom! Okay, next song... ♪ Undertaker, don't ya take too long... ♪ ♪ I only have until the end of this song! ♪ Wooo! Look at that! I ain't seen musical instincts like yours, since Pablo McGrande! You got it, Julieta, you got it! Now, 'bout your name. My name? Yeah, yer stage name! We need somethin' snappy! Somethin' fresh! Somethin' that screams fame! Hmm... I got it! You do? Tell me! Kiss Julieta goodbye! And kiss La Trituradora goodbye! Say hello to BEYONDÉ! Beyondé? Beyondé! Like... From the BEYOND, get it? THAT'S the name of a champion and a superstar! Wow... it does have a ring to it! Raw talent's an understatement! First time I laid eyes on ya, I knew I was lookin' at a diamond in the rough! Ugh! Gracia divina! I'm going to fall ill if you two keep up this self-congratulatory drivel! Erasma! Oh, don't act so surprised, Fredo! You have to know by now that I'm always watching your every move, come competition time... especially when you're galavanting around town with a new pupil, like you own the place! But, I'm only preparing Jul... I mean, Beyondé here, for Friday's competition! Ha! You're grooming her to overthrow me, is what you're doing! I see right through you, mummy - and not just because your bandages are loose! My bandages?! Whaa...? How long have they been loose? Beyondé, why didn't ya say somethin'?! I didn't think they were loose! Well, with that kind of attention to detail, I'd quit while you're ahead, little girl! Little girl?! Who're you calling a little girl, bone face?! Mind your tongue when you speak to the champ, newbie! Shut up, or I'll fly-swat you, fly! Well! Buh! Got yourself a spitfire, eh, Fredo? I like that! What say we have a little competition of our own, hmm? Right here, right now! No deal! We ain't that stupid, Erasma! No, you're just scared! Scared?! I've never been scared of anyone in my life! And I'm not about to start now! Shh! Let it go, kid! They're playin' to yer ego! It's the oldest trick in the book! Fine! I have nothing to hide - or to fear! What do you propose, bone bag? I thought you'd never ask! We'll hold our own private singing competition, much like you were just doing with Fredo... however, by our rules, the winner competes on Friday night, while the loser is banished to the Wasteland, for all eternity! Hahaha! What do you say, newbie? If you're as good as the mummy thinks you are, step up and prove it! I'm tellin' ya, Henderson, when I see them two rabble-rousers, there's no tellin' what I'm liable to do to 'em! Me too, Spiff! I might draw on 'em, right then n' there, send 'em back to their mamas in a pine box! Or, I might... Wait! Sheriff Tato said they was a father/son team, not brothers! So, they ain't got the same mamá! Oh. Right. It'd be like, I'll send 'em back to mamá an' grandma in a pine box! Whatever! They can ship 'em to the islands, for all I care! One thing's for sure... they meet us, they meet pine! Yes to that! It sure felt good helping Tia Pepa find her way back home, papá! That, it did, mijo! Uno good deed down, uno to go! This place is loco! Are you sure it's okay for me to be in here? Chiqui... with papá, you go anywhere your little heart desires! Understand? Sí, papá... what I'd really like is to go see mamá. In due time, mijo, in due time. But first, how about a tall cold leche, before we continue on our way, hmm? Milk sounds great, papá! Gracias! De nada! And I could use an ice cold agave juice! Keep an eye out for the server, yeah? Okay! Henderson! Ya hear that? It's them! It's who? It's them! The two we's lookin' for! Oh! Be quiet! We don't want 'em hearin' us! Right! Wanna take 'em down right here? That sounds like a right good idea! Follow my lead! On three! Ready? One... two... THREE! Hold it right there! You two's under arrest, by order o' the Los Muertos Sheriff Depart... Papa! Let's get outta here! That sounds like a great idea, mijo! If you two even think of following us, you'll get more of the same! S'all good! See ya 'round! Come, mijo. The service here stinks anyway! If you're so good, luchadora, why not show us what you've got? Unless, of course, you're POLLO! No! Did you just call me... POLLO?! Sí! Cluck... cluck... cluck! Nobody calls La Trituradora a chicken! Nobody! You're on! Oh, Dios mio! Beyondé! Can't you see it's a trick? Erasma Bones isn't undefeated these last ten thousand years 'cause she plays fair! She's the dirtiest player in the game! What's the matter, Beyondé? Cold feet? Afraid a little impromptu challenge will expose your glorious talents as nothing more than a ruse? A cry for attention? A waste of our time? A waste of time?! I'll show you a waste of time, you old witch! Hit it! Oh, is the great Beyondé ready to show us what she's made of? I don't like this, kid! I don't like it at all! Stick some gauze in it, mummy! This is between us girls! Who you calling a girl, you crone? Buh! Give her a line, Lola! Yes, ma'am! Sing the rest of this one, luchadora! On pitch, in key, with proper melody! ♪ Never before has my jaw hit the floor... ♪ ♪ Like the time I saw you walking out my door! ♪ Wow! Just wow! Pfft! She got lucky, Erasma! Okay, it's OUR turn! Let me guess - you have a RAP! Hahaha! Don't let her get under your, uh... skin, Fredo! Hit her with a tough one! Oh, I'm gonna! Lemme think... it's been a while since I heard pop music! A vocal coach who doesn't know pop?! What a joke! He probably dusts off his 8-track cassettes! Hahaha! Alright, wiseacres! Here's one for ya! ♪ In these shadows, it's always the same, ♪ ♪ You can't see my face, you don't know my name... ♪ ♪ And I'll emerge from the darkness, into the light, ♪ ♪ And bury you deep, in the coldest night! ♪ Wow! How fitting! It's 1-1, Beyondé! Can you muster the guts for a tiebreaker? I don't have to muster anything, bruja! Guts is my middle name! Don't you mean Gutsé? I was hoping you'd say that! Hehehe! What a couple of idiotas back at the saloon, papá! I wonder what their problem was? They sounded like they knew what they were doing, mijo... and who they were after! We must be careful! If the Los Muertos law is out to get us, finding mamá may not be as easy as doing one more good deed! Ayuda! Ayuda! Por favor! Please, help me! Whoa! Are you okay, miss? What is going on? Do you need help? If so, we're your men! We're looking to do a good deed! It's Paco! He's lost his cabeza! He's out of his mind! He destroyed mi casa, and took off! Slow down, miss! Explain! Who is Paco? Paco es mi esposo! Who, papá? He's her husband! Like you and mamá? No, Chiqui. Something tells me these two are NOTHING like me and your mamá! Where is Paco now, miss? Probably the saloon! Where he always goes after he acts up! The saloon?! No way! We can't go back there, papá! I agree, Chiqui! That would be a bad idea! But, we can care for this nice lady, to ensure that she remains safe tonight! Paco, he will cause trouble at the saloon, until they throw him out! Then he'll return, angrier than before! You don't want to meet Paco like that, trust me! Miss, with all due respect... if it's a fight your husband wants, then it's me he doesn't want to meet! Come, Chiqui! Let's take this nice lady home and heat some soup for her. We can rest our feet a while... and wait for Paco! So then, my mamá - who is the most beautiful woman in all the land under her mask, and a total superhero when her mask is on - executed la perfecta sunset-flip off the top rope! And she pinned La Gargantua one, two, three! Right in the center of the ring! And became the NEW luchadora champion of the universe! A title she holds to this very day! Guau, Chiqui! Your mamá sounds like quite the woman! That, she is, Mamá Lucia! My wonderful Julieta is the most amazing marvel of a woman who ever was! It was only because she shined so vibrantly, that I agreed to let her travel here, into the darkness, to shed more light for all! That was a risky move, Papa Diego! Many a soul has lost their way, here in The Beyond! I am sad to say... that I am one of them. You?! But, you seem like a perfectly nice lady, Mamá Lucia! With a nice home! And a nice attitude! Appearances can deceive, little one! I was bright-eyed and full of life when I arrived in Los Muertes - even though I had passed on! An accident took me from my old world YOUR world to this one! But, like so many who came before me, I had yet to realize it! I simply believed I had woken up in this strange place from a deep, deep slumber! You mean, no one told you that you were... dead? No, Chiqui. They let you find that out for yourself. How you deal with the news is up to you, and decides where you fall in the social structure of The Beyond! I'm afraid I didn't handle it well - I missed my own mamá terribly - and so, I met one who also wasn't adjusting well! Paco. Sí, Paco. He only recently accepted his new life here. And still harbors much resentment, at that! He wishes he were still among the living. And I'm often made the brunt of his anger. His anger? Yes, he can be quite angry sometimes! He just... Hasn't adjusted well to the Great Beyond, you see... That is no excuse, Mamá Lucia. Sí, I know... but, without me, I fear Paco would be completely lost! He would wander the Wasteland, and probably end up taking Momo's hand and being led away! Momo?! Oh, no, no, no! Aye... many a good man - and woman too - has been led astray by Momo's promises! Never to be seen again! Mamá Lucia, if you'll let me, I'd like to have a word with Paco, when he returns. Yes you may. But, realize that, depending on his temperament this evening, he may not be receptive to words. I know. But, I have a way of making things clear to angry men. Ha! I'll say, papá! Shh! He's back! Ehh? ¿Quiénes son estos invitados, mamá? These are my new friends, Paco! This is Papa Diego! And his little chico, Chiqui! Mmm... Hi, Paco! What do you strangers want? A word. Say your peace, amigos. I'm listening. I have all the time in the... Underworld! Mamá Lucia is a good woman, doing her best in The Beyond. She deserves one who also strives to be the best he can be. If it is not you, then you need to let her be. Mamá? What say you? I want to give you every chance to share this new life with me, Paco... but I'm not sure you want it. Oh, mamá! Lo siento! I never meant to hurt you! Forgive me, mamá! Take me back! Oh, Paco! I never threw you away! I have seen the error of my ways. You make death worth living. May I have another chance? Of course, you may! Oh, Paco! You silly fool, you! Well, mijo. Our work is done here! Is this another good deed, papá?! Will this grant us entry to the festivale?! I believe, so, mi hijo. I do believe so. Come! Let's see if El Monstruo feels the same way! Farewell, Mamá Lucia! Paco! Be happy! You too, Papa Diego! And you, Chiqui! It was nice meeting you both! Buena suerte finding tu mamá! Gracias, Mamá Lucia! Buenas noches! Buenas noches! Buenas noches! I told ya we shouldn'ta gotten into a sing-off with Erasma, kid! We played right into her trap! Oh, don't you see, Fredo? She would've gotten us one way, or another! We were targeted! She'd set out to eliminate us from the start! But, why?! Competition's the spice o' victory! What good's winnin', if ya don't beat the best o' the best?! Maybe after ten thousand years of winning, Erasma doesn't ever want to risk losing! Ah, phooey! Sounds like a lotta hogwash - and sounds like one crummy title reign to me! Me, too! I came here two years ago to earn my place in the pantheon of greats... now, my dream is destroyed! I've brought nothing but shame upon mi casa... and mi familia is lost forever. Hey! Don't talk like that, Beyondé! My name's Julieta, Fredo. No more Beyondé. Just Julieta, bad mother, disappointing wife, wanna-be singer, total failure! Don't say them things, kid! It ain't over 'til it's over! We can make a comeback! We can still win this thing! Oh, yeah? How? Look around us, Fredo. We're in the Wasteland! NOBODY comes back from the Wasteland! Hola, lost souls. AHH! What's that?! I am Momo - your guide, if you will allow it. Dios mío, es el temido Momo! Stay calm, Fredo! I'll handle this! How? Momo took away my Uncle Giuseppe! Well, I'm not afraid! Ah, your Uncle Giuseppe... I remember him well. Led him to the River Styx, I did. I knew it! Momo, we're just passing through! Everyone's just passing through. Thank you for watching over our journey, espectro! Your eternal vigilance es muy appreciada! I can do much more than watch over you, voyagers... if you only take my hand. Mi Grandpapa Ernesto used to tell me stories 'bout Momo comin' to get us, when we was little! Now, here he is! It's ike a prophecy fulfilled! Boy, oh, boy! Please, don't let Momo take me! Fear not my friends... Just take my hand and follow me into the fog... Okay, look! I dunno what kind of racket you've got going on around here, but neither of us are taking your hand, and you're not taking either of us away! Got it?! We have a very important engagement to make, and I'm not gonna miss it for the world! OR The Beyond! So, move on, wraith! Or face my wrath! So forceful. You ain't seen nothing yet, ghost boy! Oh, please, oh please! You need only take my hand, old mummy. And your fear will cease. That's it! I warned you! Ow... that hurts... my skull can't take high pitches... Ow... ow... ow! Hey! Ya did it! Momo split! And ya made him flee using nothin' but your voice! Yeah, well... hopefully, it doesn't have the same effect on judges! Gracias, Beyondé! I am forever in your debt! But, I'm already in yours, Fredo. Just paying it back. And call me Julieta, okay? Let's leave Beyondé on the stage. Sure thing, Bey... er, Julieta! C'mon! Let's find our way back to town! I have no intention of letting that old crone, Erasma, run us off! Her little scheme's gonna backfire! And I'm gonna be crowned the Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond... even if it kills me! Uhh, hehe... be careful whatcha say here, kid. Things're listenin'! I can't believe what happened back there in the saloon, Henderson! Why, if I was half the man I used to be... We'll find 'em, Spiff! Don't you worry! And when I get my bony fingers 'round that big fella's neck, why, I'ma gonna... Where we gonna find 'em's the problem? They're for sure layin' low now! Ain't nobody dumb enough to make a scene like that an' just stroll off, with their spurs a-jinglin'! Well, that's purdy much exactly what they did, Spiff! That big, ugly goon defeated up in front of the whole dang saloon! Now, it's only a matter o' time before word gets back to Sheriff Tato! Yeah... unless we find them two first, haul 'em in, an' hang 'em up by their boot heels, before that there gossip mill gets goin'! I like that plan, Spiff! I like it lots! We just got to figure out where they're hidin'! Right... Hey, if you was a lowdown, dirty pollo like the both o' them, and you knew a coupla straight-shootin' lawmen like us was gunnin' for ya, where would YOU hide? Hmm... there's only one place to hide in 'at situation - THE WASTELAND! Ya think?! I do! Lookit - it's foggy, it's far, an' that creeper Momo's there to run interference, if'n the law comes a-lookin'! Hot dang! Yer right! Let's go get 'em right now! We'll drag 'em kickin' an' screamin' to the town jail! Then, Sheriff Tato'll name us heroes 'fore this Dia of the Dead's over! Deal! Wait... which way's the Wasteland? Uhh... This way, I think... no, this way... no, it's... It's 'round here some place, I know that! Forget it! We'll find it! An' we'll find THEM! Yeah! Stay close, Chiqui. This area is treacherous, and El Monstruo may be in hiding! But, Papa... what if El Monstruo doesn't know we're here looking for mamá? Disparates! The all-seeing, all-knowing El Monstruo will feel our desires, and know that we performed the two good deeds tradicional required to be granted our wish! He will not leave us without an answer, Chiqui, that much I know! ¿Quien va alla? Papa! Was that you?! No, mijo. It was not I! It sounded like... EL MONSTRUO! Sí! Tell me, intrusos... why do you seek entry into the Festivale De Los Muertos? It's mi mamá, Senor Monstruo! Tu madre? Sí! Allow me to introduce us! Mi nombre es Papa Diego, y this is mi hijo, Chiqui! Mi mamá, Julieta, came to The Beyond to compete in the... what is it again, papá? The Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond competition! Sí, that! We're here to cheer her onstage... and, well, she asked me to come be part of her performance! We know it's frowned upon for the living to mingle with the dead any other time of year, El Monstruo! But, we also know that today es muy especiale! Sí, muy! Little Chiqui hasn't seen his mamá in two years now. And likewise, I haven't seen mi esposa. We miss her terribly. And, if she wins this evening... She'll finally be able to come back home! Sí, that es la tradicion... but, there is another part of it, that I am not sure you're aware of! Eh? There is? Sí. While it is true, a victory would enable your wife and mother to return home with you... a defeat would mean that she cannot leave The Beyond... ever! Ever? Never. Oh, no! Papa! We could lose mamá forever?! I-I did not know this. Many do not. It's in the fine print of the crossover manual, on page 46. There's a manual?! Sí, there is. Nobody told us! Don't feel bad, you're not the only one. I have this conversation often. If you do review the manual, I also suggest you see page 47, which details a hack to WINNING the Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond competition! A hack?! I love hacking! And I love winning! Can you tell us about this hack, El Monstruo? I will! It says that any singer who is accompanied by a partner who dances hard enough, dances like their life depends on it - which, of course, it does - shall summon the power of the ancient Gods of the Beyond! Gods of the Beyond? And, with the power of the ancients possessing their limbs and vocal chords, these contestants will be unstoppable in the eyes of the judges, dead and undead! Victory, it is written, shall be theirs! Whoaaa... so, if I dance with mamá, like she asked papá in his dream... she'll win! El Monstruo, may we please enter the festivale and find mi mamá? Please?! There are many reasons by which the living pursue The Beyond, as I am sure there is a reason your mamá parted ways with her loving family. Trust me, I hear them all. But, my favorite, far and away, es amor! Amor? Love, Chiqui. The reason behind every step we've made, since the moment we left our casa! Sí, amor. I see it in your eyes. Hear it in your voices. Ohh! Love is the noblest of reasons one would seek to pass into The Beyond, while still drawing warm breath here! Love drives us! Inspires us! Enables us to climb heights undreamt of! Cross the deepest seas! Brave the most raging fires! It is the sole reason we stand before you, El Monstruo. I love my wife. And her little one here loves her even more, if that's possible. In love, luchador, ALL things are made possible such as, your entry into Los Muertos! Papa! I think he means... I think he does too, mijo! I mean, not to be presumptuous, Senor Monstruo. Mucho respeto. Gracias, senor. This woman you pursue is very brave to stand and face Erasma Bones in her own realm. She will need all that bravery, and then some. Best wishes, to all three of you. You may enter Los Muertos. Really?! Papa! We can go in! We can go in! Sí, mijo! Sí! Muchísimas gracias, Senor Monstruo! There is no time to waste, caballeros! Go now! And find your love! Bueno! Come, papá! Hurry! Wait for me, Chiqui! Senor Monstruo, we cannot thank you enough! Thank me by finding that woman, returning her to your realm, and living happily ever after! The clock is ticking, luchador! Right! Adios, amigo! I'm coming, Chiqui! Easy, niño, easy! On behalf of my beloved llama, Tomás, I'd like to welcome you all to another Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond competition! Where the best of the best vie for the coveted title of Greatest Singer Ever! As you're all aware, for the past ten thousand years, we have had ONE dominant champion - Erasma Bones! Sí, sí, she's amazing, isn't she? Truly amazing! And, well, it looks like there won't be an upset this year, either - since NOBODY else has entered the contest! Therefore, before we present the title of Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond to Erasma yet again, she's going to grace us all with a solo performance for the ages! Everybody hang tight, while our diva originale gets ready! And in a very short while, prepare to put those bones together for the legend herself Erasma Bones! This is it, kid! Everything we been workin' toward for the past two years! Two years! And you're ready! I ain't never seen a singer more ready! We got to getcha signed up, then I wantcha to go up there, an' show the Beyond what you're made of! Let it rip, Beyondé! Okay! But, you know, Fredo... I'm not so sure about this Beyondé thing, after all. Eh, you're right! It tries too hard! Julieta, it is! C'mon, we're almost there! I don't like this, Henderson! I don't like it so much neither, Spiff! This Wasteland's one creepy zona! Pfft! What are ya, scared? Huh? Me? Hmph! I ain't no pollo! Sounds like yer 'bout to wet yer pantalones, hombre! Me?! You're the one shakin' like a leaf over there! I'm shakin' 'cause I'm brimmin' with righteous rage, hombre! Not 'cause I'm scared! Uh-huh. We'll see 'bout that. ¡Bienvenidos, hombres muertos! It's him! It's Momo! Don't look at 'im! Don't talk to 'im! Maybe he'll go away! Go away? But, only if we can go together, dears. Don't fear the reaper. Come... take my hand. We'll be able to fly. I'm your friend. Run! Go, go, go! Mwahahahaha! Alright, everybody! This is it! The moment we've all been waiting for! The Madame of Stardom! The Queen of Mean! The Best Dame in the Game! Lemme hear those bones rattle for the one, the only... ERASMAAAA BOOOONES! Well, I wish I could say it's nice to be back here on this stage! Alas, the pleasure's all yours! Lola! Hit my music! She's great. You're better. You think so? Wouldn't be here if I didn't. You're like the padre I never had. If ya need me to say it out loud, kid, you're like the daughter I never had. Oh, Fredo! You old mummy! Yeah, yeah, hang on a sec... Yo, Leo! Got one more contestant here for the show! Can she go on after Erasma's done? Her name's JULIETA! Okay, Julieta! You're up next! Break a leg! What's wrong, kid? My baby Chiqui's not here to dance with me, Fredo. Part of my dream was to have him by my side. I get it. But, we can't always have everything we want, y'know? I know... I was really just hoping to see mi familia tonight... I'll be alright, don't worry. Worried, I ain't! One more thing, kid. Yes? KNOCK 'EM DEAD! I think I see the stage from here, papá! I hope we didn't miss mama's performance! We haven't missed her! She won't go on without you, mijo! Come! She's here somewhere! Let us find her! Okay! The one and only Erasma Bones, everybody. The ten thousand year champ. Let's hear it for her. Woooo! Ok, now! Ok, now. If I may have your attention. Attention, please! I know I said there were no contestants this year, but as fate would have it, I was approached backstage by a young lady who asked to sing! So, without further ado, here she is! Put 'em together for lovely JULIETA! What?! What is she doing here, Lola?! I thought I told you to make them disappear! I did, Erasma! I chased them out into the Wasteland! NOBODY comes back from the Wasteland! Well obviously, we're dealing with a special case... but, no matter! This is MY crowd! They'll boo her offstage in no time, and victory will once again be mine, all mine! That's right... I hope! It's her, papá! It's mamá! Sí, Chiqui... she's even more beautiful than when I last laid eyes on her. She's breathtaking! Let her know we're here, papá! MAMA! Wait, mijo! She wants to speak. Let her. Hi... before I sing for you tonight... I have a story to tell. It's a quick story, don't worry... I came to The Beyond from the other side two years ago...I didn't die... I crossed over of my own free will. I left behind the most beautiful baby boy, and a loving husband... they deserved better. But, all my life, I've been blessed... sometimes, it feels like cursed... with a skill I didn't choose and cannot control. And with a dream that refused to remain still in my heart. I came to The Beyond to show that skill, and to fulfill that dream. And now, here I am. And there you are. And here goes nothing! Fredo! Music, please! I just wish my boy Chiqui were here... Now, mijo! Go to her! Mamá! I'm here! Chiqui! Mi hijo! You came! Papa's here, too! He saw you in his dream! We came as fast as we could, mamá! Oh, mi familia, mi amor, Chiqui! I love you, mamá! Need a dancer, while you sing? I thought you'd never ask! Follow my lead, baby! Go get 'em, mamá! You can do it! She's got a dance partner? But, that's a duet! This isn't a couples show, it's a solo performance! Solo! Oh, for crying out loud, will you stop making excuses and shut up already? Ingrata! We did it, mamá! We did it! Woohoo! How'd you like THAT? Me too, hahaha! Alright! Well, it seems we had ourselves a close race this year, after all! On behalf of Tomás, I'd like to thank BOTH our talented singers for showing us what they're made of! Huh! I don't have to show anyone what I'M made of! My legend precedes me! Talk about a nail-biter! The judging was close, but the tallies are in! And the winner is... Hola, papá. Hola, mijo. How did you sleep? Fine. Whatcha doin'? I'm just organizing some of our old familia memories in our photo album. Oh... are you looking at fotos of mamá? Sí... sí, I couldn't help myself, mijo. She's radiant, my Julieta. Even on the page, I can't stop staring... but, enough dilly-dallying! I've got to make room for all of her Greatest Singer Beyond the Beyond fotos! Are you muchachos STILL looking at my fotos?! Sí, sí! It's not every casa that has a grand champion within its walls! I must chronicle your career in the finest detail! Oh, puh-lease! That was TWO years ago! And I haven't toured in over a year! I'm just a housewife now - and a happy one, at that! We're happy to have you back, mamá! Two years felt like forever, when you were gone! And since you've been back with us, it feels like yesterday when you won that competition in The Beyond! Time flies, mijo! But, know this... Mamá got that craziness out of her system. And she won't ever leave you again, bueno? Either of you. But, mamá! If you ever DID wanna compete again, I could dance beside you, and we'd be victorious in every contest we entered, no?! No! In fact, I'd be perfectly happy if I NEVER visited The Beyond again in mi vida! Only AFTER su vida, right, Julieta? Very funny, Diego. Look, mamá! I've been working on some new dance moves! Go, Chiqui, go Chiqui, go! Hahaha! Oh, mi vida loca! And I LOVE IT!
