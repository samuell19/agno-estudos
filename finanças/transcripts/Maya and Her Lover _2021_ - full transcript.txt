I left my- - Your phone. Thanks sweetness. I had fun tonight, you? Well, maybe dinner next week? Talk soon. You've got to come with me next time. I know. Whatever, you always say that. No, for real this time. Okay, tell me about the men. Girl. I tell you they never left me alone. They loved my blackness, my afro, my lips. Yeah? I don't know if we're exotic to them or what, but they seem to love my naturalness. You know I think natural comes off as sexiness outside the US. Men seem to be attracted to that. Whatever it is they sure love giving head. Wait. What does one thing have to do with the other? Okay. Oh, damn. Is there more? Nope. Well, I'ma light up. Is that cool? Yeah. Wanna hit it? I can't believe in 2018 you're still a weed virgin. The little old lady next door smokes. Nope, not once. You wear that "Taylor Swift" like a badge of honor. Huh? You know, "Pollyanna." I'm so sweet and pure. There are a lot of things I've never tried but I'm no Pollyanna. I mean I've done my dirt. You forget I've known your ass since high school. I know all your dirt. It's more like dust. It does smell good though. Here. Nah. What are you afraid of? Nothing, it's just not my thing. But the Naked Project is? The Nu Project, and I didn't say I was gonna do it. I just said that those women were very courageous. Scars and cellulite and all. That does take courage. To be that comfortable with your body. I love my body, but yeah, I'm not sure I could do it. I mean the thought of anybody anywhere all over the world being able to look at my flaws. I just can't imagine. Young girls do it just for fun on the Gram. I know right? Where's the modesty? Oh, we sound like two old ass women. 'Cause we are. Speak for yourself. Oh! Who is this? Oh, that's Gerard. He's a travel contact from the site that sent me. He's cute. Mm-hm, and pretty good in bed. You slept with this young boy? He looks like a kid. I know, but he's no kid. He's 30. Really? Have you noticed that since hitting 35 all the young men, with their pants hanging off their asses, wanna push up on you? Girl, you couldn't pay me to date a younger guy. I mean, what can they do for me? And I especially hate the term "cougar." Young men can be pretty fun though. Great for sex. Yeah but, I'm too old for, "Just for fun". I want the real deal. Marriage? Yeah, why not? Marriage is dead. No, I don't believe that. That's just what people say. 2018 is about living without labels. He. She. - Dead. - No. It's "They" now. I just think that marriage is the next step. If that's what you want, then why are you hibernating in this house and dressing like an old lady? And wasting time on old man booty call. I do not dress like an old lady. Okay, maybe sometimes. But I'm kicking booty call to the curb, he just doesn't satisfy me. What a surprise. You know I even tried getting drunk, and that didn't even help. Ain't that the worst. These crackers are stale. Yeah, I meant to throw them out. Then why'd you let me eat them? You seem to be enjoying them. All right dad, it's your turn. Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. No! I hope these clues are better than the last time. Yeah, well, just guess it right this time please. Yeah aunt Juanita 'cause we're beating you guys. Time is running out. Hello. Hey, sis. Philip, baby brother. Really? Still? Like how old do I have to be before you stop calling me baby brother? Uh, you'll always be younger than me. How crazy you called I was just thinking about you. See, and I was thinking about you. How much do you need? Ha, ha, ha, very funny. You know today is the anniversary right? Yeah. I was just looking at pictures. Depressed or nostalgic? Not depressed. Happy memories. I was just laughing, thinking about one of those stories that he used to tell us. Oh don't get me started on those stories. You talking about the neighbors, or when he took down a gang of five all by himself right? Any of them, they were all hilarious. The old man was crazy. He wouldn't like you calling him old. I guess not, right? I don't know I've just been thinking a lot about him lately. Yeah. That time of the year. Yeah, maybe, I don't know. I miss him. Me too. I miss you too, big sis. When you gonna come down and visit? To Texas? No way you're not getting me to Texas. It's too damn hot. And too Republican. And you're actually right about both, yeah. But you know, I gotta go where the government sends me, which reminds me, I'm actually running. I just wanted to say hello. - Hey, Maya. - Yeah? Love you, sis. You too. I'm coming! I'm coming! Yo I was just calling you, man. I rang the buzzer like eight times. Yeah man, I said "I'm coming" like eight times. Oh. My bad, I had these headphones on. Okay cool. Exact change. Tip? Ah, it's cool Mama, next time. Get that fixed too I wanted to take real women of any shape and size, treat them like models photographing their real bodies, without the sexual under or overtones. Shit. Hi, how are you? Hi. Um, can I please have a large soy caramel latte and a- - Blueberry scone. You know me so well. Hey, how are you? What's going on? Oh, you know. I haven't seen you in a while. So, is this to stay or to go? Oh I can't stay today. I got some things that I'm working on back at the house. Okay, wait a minute. Did you change your hair? No, it's the same. You sure you can't stay? What'chu been working on these days? Oh, you know I've been- - Hold on, wait, you lost weight. Definitely not. All right look, what about tomorrow? I wanna sit down with you and catch up. Oh, oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh shit! What's wrong? I left my wallet at home. You don't have apple pay or cash app? No. It's okay, I can just... I can run home and grab it. No, no, no. It's on the house. No, no, you don't have to do that. Hey look, it's my way of getting you back here tomorrow. Sure, tomorrow. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. Hey, there, Maya. Hey, Mr. Ross. How you doing today? I can't do everything like I use to do, but I still can do it. That one again. Fred? Was there mail? All right, see you later. Honey could you help me with that. Sure. You know, if I weren't married, I could give you a run for your money. Fred! Fred! Isn't that your wife Mr. Ross? Don't let this cane fool you. Goodbye, Mr. Ross I gotta go. Mr. Ross! Welcome to the I'm your host Trevite Willis One day when I was picking up a bottle of wine family has been able to survive Harlem changes. Hey Mr. Sorry for the delay. Sorry, we haven't had much time. It's crazy busy today. That's a good thing. I'm not complaining. Anyway, where were we? Oh you know what, you ever finish that photo book, exhibit? No, I'm still working on it. What's that, design workshop? More school? Not sure, just checking it out. You and school. You got more education than anybody I know. You can never have too much education. True. But at some point you gotta do something with it. Yeah, I'm also thinking about. Babatunde! Oh, hell naw, my brother. Man you look good. Thanks man, you too. So you back in Brooklyn now? Yeah, you know I can't stay away too long. Right, right. Hey, have a seat. Oh shit, number two lady. Excuse me. You always order the number 2. I don't cook much. Oh Kaseem, this is... I'm Kaseem, nice to meet you. I'm Maya. Have a sit, let's talk. Babatunde man, I wish I could but I got things to do, places to be man. As long as you promise to come back through. Oh no doubt. You seem excited to see him. That's my man right there. More like a boy. I mean he may be young, but up here, he's twice as smart as most men his age. Hello, Sweetness, this is Henry. Call me, I have tickets for Hamilton, thought you might wanna go. Hello, Mrs. Trudeau, this is Jim from the IRS, first I just want to say you are not in trouble but it does seem there was a mistake on your taxes all we need is your credit card and its urgent that you call us back... Sure. Seriously. It's raining outside, no shit Sherlock. Who is this? Ah, the young delivery fella, I know he aint flirting with me. Girl, that key is for emergencies, not for you to let yourself in whenever What if I was in here butt naked with a man? Girl, scones. Blueberry? Of course. You will never believe what happened to me last night. Wait, let me get coffee for this. Okay. SO, a deaf man asked me out. Wait, what? I shit you not. I'm organizing. Again? Seriously, okay, a deaf guy. So, I was waiting for the train, and this gorgeous man kept staring at me. At first I was flattered, but he kept staring and kept staring, and I got annoyed, so I gave him the "don't even" look. Like, keep it moving buddy. Exactly, then he gave me a thumbs up. A thumbs up? Cheezy, yes. But then he smiles, a really sexy smile. Oh, yeah. A sexy smile will do it every time. He comes over, still smiling and holds up his cell phone. He had typed out, "I think you're beautiful, I'm David, I'm deaf and I'd like to take you out. Can I call you?" But how's he gonna... I said, "How?" And then realized he couldn't hear me. So, of course I said it again, only louder. So... Oh you need help. But, he reads lips so he understood. But, of course. So he typed back, "I have a machine that..." and then the train pulls into the station. So what did you do? I gave him my number. I don't want to discriminate. Plus I was curious. You meet the most random, outlandish and interesting men I swear. I do. Maybe it's the hair. What? But, wait, it gets better. Okay wait, coffee is not gonna cut it, I gonna get wine for the rest of this story. So, I'm home last night giving myself a pedicure, Oh nice. And I get a call, a woman's voice. She's like, "We met the other day, this is David. You mean like a robot, like Siri? No, it was a real live person. I said, "OK, hello." He/she said, "Is it weird hearing me like this?" Duh! He said, "I type into a machine and the operator repeats what I type, then types to me what you say." Kinky. So, in this woman's voice, he starts telling me how hot I am and asks if he can come over my house. And he wasn't taking no for an answer. He called three times. I had to tell him to stop calling. He was way too aggressive. It was creepy. It's him. Let me tell this mutha something. Hello! Hola. Yeah, hey, what's up? Hey, who is this? We back to that again? It's Kaseem. Hi Kaseem, I wasn't expecting you to call me. You Dominican? What? You answered the phone "hola." Just being silly. I really don't wanna have to call the cops, but I will. Is this a bad time? No, what's up? Just wanted some advice. And you thought to call me? You're funny. I know you can't hear me, but you DO understand. Babatunde told me you was a college girl. Aha, what about it? Look tryna' soak up all the knowledge I can from someone such as yourself.. I'm sure Babatunde can put you in touch with somebody who can help you. Who's that? I just need a couple minutes of your time. Come on, help a brother out. Okay sure, okay. How about later on at Nola's? Ok, fine. Bye. Damn, he's making you nervous like that? He doesn't make me nervous. What did he say? He said he wants to get together and talk about business, but I think he was mostly flirting. Clearly. But he's just a baby, I think he is 22. You remember How Stella Got Her Groove Back? You remember how it ended. You don't have to marry him, just have some fun. Oh, I hate that term cougar. I'm not taking somebody's baby. You are the only one who keeps using that word. Besides, you can do what you want - he's not your child plus he's legal. Yeah, barely... I bet you glad we came here 'stead of Nola's - they don't serve wine. I'm not completely sure you didn't plan it that way. Naw, seriously, they just closed early. Why don't you just fill up the glass, that way you don't have to refill it so many times? It's part of the experience, you need room in the glass for the wine to, breathe. Whatever, man. You can keep that alcohol. I told you I'm a Muslim, I don't smoke or drink. So you have no vices? Vices? Addictions? Cigarettes, weed, molly? Hold up so what you like a pill head or a junkie? Excuse me. I don't do drugs. Occasionally, I..drink wine. Alright, you threw me off for a second. Talking all that molly shit. Kids your age are into all kind of drugs. Kids, huh. Well, I'm not like most men my age or any age. Really, how are you different? Any dessert? You want dessert? None for me. Come on man, you girls kill me. You know you want dessert - why don't you just get it. Don't tell me you're on a diet? No. But I do like to watch what I eat. So you buy into that hype? A sister like you? Like me? Sexy, successful. You're thick too but black men like that, we like a woman that look like a woman. You should know that at your age. My age? Oh what you thought I was gonna let that, kids your age thing slide? Touche. No but seriously, why do you feel the need to look like Europeans? I'm not interested in looking like Europeans. You straighten your hair, you're trying to be skinny. This is just a hairstyle. I could stand to lose a few pounds, but I love my curves and I not interested in looking skinny, just healthy. See, that's the problem with us black people, we don't have any self-respect, we aspire to be like them when we need to aspire to be the best version of us that we can be. Natural hair, pure temples. You certainly do sound like the Nation of Islam. This is serious we have to help our people. Look, like no other race we are self destructing, and it's up to my generation, yeah I said it, my generation to do something about it. Would you like anything else? Nothing for me. Kaseem? Naw, I'm good. Oh, don't worry. I got it. Dinner was on me today. Naw, I got mine. Really, don't worry, my treat. Oh, OK. My pocket is a little tight this week, too. You know, you really didn't have to walk me all the way home, it's just a couple blocks. No it's cool, I wanted you to see my chivalry - show off my grown man, you feel me. Look, I'm really flattered that somebody your age... A man. A man your age would be interested in me, but really I'm old enough to be your... aunt. I've dated older women before, you're not the first. We're not dating. You wouldn't be the first. - Besides girls my age... - Women? No, girls. They play too many games. I don't have time for that shit, I'm looking for somebody I can build something with. Maya! Are you okay? I'm OK, Mr. Ross, thanks. Just checking. Yeah I'm okay too Mr. Ross. - Keep your voice down - what? My neighbors. Like I said... What are you doing? Damn, you thick. You know you're sexy right? What? I said you're thick as hell. Please stop using the word thick. You know you're sexy right? Yes, I heard you. Yes, oh yes. Don't stop don't stop, don't stop. Thick. Come on down for dinner. Okay. Turn around. Huh? Turn around. Oh so that's what we're doing now? Since when? Dad I'm 14 every girl my age wears makeup. Listen girls wear makeup to enhance their looks. Most of the time because they're not very pretty. You are beautiful just the way you are you don't need to wear makeup. Clean your face and come down for dinner. Only fast girls wear red lipstick. Hey. Yeah, hey, what's up? You want something to drink? Nah. So, show me what you got. My business plan and LLC papers. Were you expecting something a little more grand? No, not at all, it's nice. You really need a lawyer. I know. And your business plan needs a lot of work. I know. Then... I mean I was hoping that maybe you can help me with that? You read this? Of course. I've read all those books. Naw but this one is great. Oh! You've... Oh! You've read it? Don't sound so surprised, I can read. It's just that people don't read as much as they used to, except for maybe college students. I read all the time. You don't have to be in college to read. Damn, you got a lot of books though. But do you have Baratunde Thurston's "How to be Black" or Kevin Powell-"The Black Male Handbook?" You've read all those? I've read all of them. What you don't believe me? "My Soul on Ice", "Manchild in the Promised Land", "By Any Means Necessary." Quiz me. I'm not gonna quiz you, I can tell that you know more than hip hop. Don't sleep on hip hop, Tupac was one of the greatest writers/lyricists period. I'll give you that - that's my generation. You saying that your generation wasn't Eldridge Cleaver? old lady? And don't forget about Kendrick Lamar, pulitzer Prize winner. Hip Hop has come a long way from 2-Live Crew. You are so sexy. What? I'm saying sex was good the other night. Let's just deal with the business plan. You can't take a compliment? Is it 'cause you think that you're fat? I don't think I'm fat, and, yes, I can take a compliment. I forgot your generation is kind of sensitive. My generation? You said it first. Why are you still single? And how old are you? You all up in my business. Seriously. And what do you do? I was a photographer, an interior designer. I've done a lot things. I had a real estate company but I sold that, and now I'm just trying to figure out what to do next. How old are you? And why are you single? I'm 39 and I guess I haven't met the right man yet. Thirty-nine, you look good for your age. Really good. Thanks. And the pussy still good too. Have you tried online dating? I'm sure you could find a man on there. What the hell is that? "King of Kings you have a call." My phone, hold on. Hello, yeah, hey what's up? Alright, I'll be over in a little while, alright, peace. Sorry, I gotta bounce. Okay. I wasn't trying to fix you up with anybody, I just wanted to see where your head was at. You are young. Besides, this isn't happening. I am too old to date you. I mean, can I get a hug then? Since I'm about to leave. I thought you said that you had to go? Don't be scared. I've already seen what you got. You checking out my six pack? No, I was just straightening the covers. Good morning? You just woke up? Yeah. What time is it? Almost eleven. Damn, you put it on me last night. I'm starving. I could make you something to eat. You got any cereal? Like Captain Crunch Frosted Flakes? No, but I can make you an omelet. You know how to make those? I do. Do you eat Omelets? I'm from the ghetto, I'll eat anything. Hello? Who's that? My girlfriend. Your girlfriend, you're gay? No, my best friend. She has keys... - Oops. - that I'll be taking away. Sorry, girl, you weren't answering your phone and I was worried. Hello. The ringer is off. You remember Kaseem? You brought breakfast? Scones. I'm not a cougar. I don't know what happened. How was it? Good. Not great? Better than the first time. First time? Shhh. And his... Nice and big. Big? Oh, yeah, all the steroids in those happy meals went to the right place. Six pack? No fat. Alright, I gotta go, I'll call you later. Have fun. See, this is how it is in the ghetto. Sleeping on the floor. Yeah, but I have a bed. What? Stop. You are so rough. I'm a girl. What the... - Shit. - That's crazy. He is dead? No he is a... He's dead. He just killed him. He is gonna take his... You wanna do something? Like what? I thought you didn't smoke? I'm a work in progress. You never smoked before? I told you I didn't. Not even in college? I was always so afraid of getting caught. Ain't that what you college girls do, smoke and lesbianism? Well, live a little, yo. All you gotta do is Inhale, hold it for a few, And then, Blow it out All right try alright take it easy, hold on, slow hold on. Alright you good, you good. What made you get this one? I got it when my brother died. And this one? It feels bumpy. That's where I was stabbed. Stabbed? How did that happen? This dude my mother used to mess with, used to beat her up all the time. One day I got tired of it. I told him to get the fuck out. He stabbed me. How old were you? Ten, eleven. That's terrible. There was so much blood everywhere. They thought I was gonna die 'cause of the blood I lost. What was going through your mind? Honestly, I was mad cause I knew I'd miss school. Back then I used to love going to school, I got all A's and I played ball. Basketball? Yeah, we had a game against PS-88 the next day. After that, we moved in with my grandmother, switched schools, and I started skipping. At ten. Yeah, I was a muthafucka. You got anymore pizza though? What's with the cat food? Awww, my poor cat. She got out through the fire escape, and I'm hoping she comes back. So I leave the bowl of just in case. Old women and their cats. This is the video I was talking about. Wait, hold up, isn't that the dude from "Think Like A Man." He used to be a rapper? I think he just that one hit. ♪ Oh, it doesn't seem that I'll be going nowhere ♪ ♪ I'm just a victim of the ghetto, oooh, ♪ ♪ it doesn't seem that I'll be getting too far ♪ ♪ too far too far ♪ I love this song. What you know about the ghetto, college girl? You do know that people from the ghetto can go to college, right? Victim of the ghetto. So many black people are victims. It's a shame. I refuse to be a victim. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I just get so upset every time I think about what's happening to our people. All this police brutality. Every other race seem to work past their history, not us. You know there's more to it than that. Tell me something personal about you? Come on man, I don't like answering questions. Come on, I answer all of your questions. Is Kaseem your real name? I heard Tunde call you something else. Yes. That was just a nickname. What year did you graduate high school? Or did you? I got a GED. And where were you? What'cha mean? When I first met you, Tunde said you're back. Wow, you don't forget nothing do you? I was out in New Jersey trying to stay out of trouble. You been in trouble a lot? You been to prison? No. Any children? Nope. Not one? I just said no. What about you? You get in trouble a lot? You have any kids? You wanna pass by the cafe? No, the little fella is coming this way now, I don't wanna run into him on the street. Why? How would that look? Like two adults talking. If he kissed me, I'd be mortified. It's been months - no one has seen you two together yet? We don't leave the apartment. What kind of relationship is that? It's not, he's 22, I can't even bring myself to call him daddy in bed. Then why are you with him? He's full of ideas and passionate about his future, I like that. And the sex is good? We've come a long way. And really sometimes he can be distant, almost cold sometimes. That's a good thing? And all the young girls on his Facebook page. Facebook? First, never be Instagram or Facebook friends with a lover, at any age, it'll drive you insane, and, second, is that why you're dressed like somebody out of "Love and Hip Hop?" What's wrong with my outfit? It is a little young don't you think? You're always talking about my clothes, I jazzed it up. Hold up, I wanna run in here and grab something for dinner. Damn, look at shorty. She got an ass. Man, I'm telling you she's a grown woman. But is she fine, you gotta admit that, she is fine. You know what I am saying Hey, what's your name? Maya. You in college? I'm 39. Really? Damn son, she mad old. I'm too old for you, but I'm not mad old. Sorry, ma'am. Shut up. You ain't that much younger than me. They said nothing to me. Hey. What took you so long? I had to get meat for dinner. I have been out here for like an hour, mosquitoes biting me up and shit. Well let me get up here and cook this food. But that's not the point though, mosquitoes are messing me outside, it's inconsiderate. Matter of fact, what are you wearing? You're too old for that shit man. What's your problem? And why don't you answer the phone? Some girl blowing my phone up. Who is she? I don't know, some chick that I don't fuck with no more. You don't know? Or some chick you don't fuck with no more? Yeah, girls your age are like that. Hold up, what that mean? You're young, they're young, you play games like that at that age. You and this age thing. I don't see nobody your age trying to get up in here. Let me tell you something, you're more than welcome to leave, because I was just fine before your young ass came up in here. Cool. I'm out. Peace. So you just gonna let me leave like that? I don't play games. You didn't know? I'm mad old. hey yo, I got a lot on my mind right now. My hustle ain't really going the way I want it to go. But I really don't wanna leave. Then you need to work on your attitude. I'm sorry. You forgive me baby? Whatever. Cool. Hey, Grandma, what's up? Uncle Jimmy said that? Forget him. Look I don't never have to come back again. Period. End of story. Peace. Is everything all right? I'm good man com'on, you know I don't like that touchy feely shit. Who was that on the phone? Your grandmother? Yeah. I thought you said she was dead. No, that was my other grandmother. I don't wanna talk about that. Watch out. Okay. You talking to me? Hello, what did you say? I said I gotta stay focused... you gotta stay focused. And this is you focused? You can't get defensive with everything I say. Just let that sink in. That's why you're holed up in this brownstone instead of balling out of control. Everything isn't about money. That's exactly what a poor person would say. That's exactly how the white man wants you think. That's why they keep getting richer, and we keep getting poorer. I'm not poor. All right, you've got a lil money, but it's not Mark Zuckerberg money. You know your rhetoric is skewed and capricious. What is capricious? And you say that you're for your people, but really everything you say is a put down. It sounds more like self-hatred than self-esteem. Look, you don't know what you're talking about all right. I love me. I believe in me and my abilities. I don't need you to believe in me, but if you're ride or die... Oh here we go. What about you and your lack of follow-through? School, your business plan... Fuck school. Mark Zuckerberg didn't go to school. Mark Zuckerberg was a Harvard dropout whose million dollar business was about to take off. Not a high school drop out. So you're saying that Mark Zuckerberg is better than me? You saying that I'm worthless because I got a GED? you think Mark Zuckerberg is better than me? Where are you going? I'm going to the mosque, everything is stressing me out my family, bitches, and your bullshit. I need to pray. Shit, not in a million years did I expect I was pregnant. Honestly, I thought I was going through the change early, like early, early. At least you're in a good position financially. It takes more than finances to be a mother, and I'm sure I don't want to be one. Then why are you taking this so hard? 'Cause who wants to be in this position? I'm not a teenager. I can't believe this happened. Maybe it's a blessing. Seriously? OK, maybe it's not. I like my life just the way it is. What? Don't you ever feel lonely? I'm used to being alone. The result of being an only child. Which I swore I'd never do to a kid. Besides, is loneliness reason enough to have a baby? I like my freedom. I like traveling. I like being able to pick up and go whenever I choose want. And I shouldn't have to apologize for that. Okay, I feel you. But don't you think its kinda of selfish women our age choosing career over family? And? Isn't that our right. Isn't that what feminism is about - our right to choose? What percentage of men our age are childless? You don't know right? Cause no one ever talks about that. This might be your last chance to have a baby. I am okay with that. Ice cold water Ice cold water how you doing miss, would you like ice cold water? No? I got the small ones too for the baby. How much? It's just a dollar. Ice cold water. Hello Aye, yeah, hey, what's up? What's up? What's wrong? Nothing. Why you so quiet? What, I am supposed to be excited cause you called. Come on, man. That was three weeks ago. I needed time to clear my head. What're you up to? Making my dinner. Can I come by later? For what? Just to check you out. Not a good idea. Come on, man, I miss you. I know I was being capricious, I've been working on myself. I'm in a better place right now. I just need a chance to explain. Please just hear me out. So check it Maya Angelou is your favorite author, right? Yeah. Why? What do you mean why? What is about her writing over anybody else? It's truthful, poetic. And it makes me feel... happy, melancholy. For me, Manchild in the Promised Land. In the book the writer goes to visit his boy and his boys sisters are there arguing over an egg. It was the only food they had to eat. They started fighting and shit and the egg drops and breaks and the sisters started crying. And how fucked up and hopeless they felt, I get it. I'm really glad I took the time to clear my mind and get focused. That's good. I wasn't focusing on my goals before. I was letting petty bullshit distract me. From now on everything I do, every person I deal with it will be goal oriented. And what's the goal? Success. Success at what? You know now I can actually answer that question I'm a start like a artist management company. But I gotta learn to manage myself first. Good. That's why I decided to be celibate. Excuse me. We just had sex. I know, but I wanted this to be the last time. You're very special, and Allah brought us together for a reason, and I want to build something with you. Look, you're 22 and I'm flattered you think that you love me. Wait, hold up, I never said that I loved you, and please quit bringing up my age. That blinds you from what I have to offer you. Okay, what did you mean by build? I like you, and I like spending time with you. I think we can help each other out. Your experience can help me get started, my energy can help you get out of your slump. Slump? Don't take offense to what I am saying, I am just telling it like it is because we as black people need to... Not another speech. Just hear me out. When I say build something, it doesn't necessarily mean romance. I think sex complicates things, right now, I need to focus on conquer the world without any distractions. I think we can really work with each other, help each other out I build you up, you build me up, really get to know each other. Sure. If you want to be celibate, I can respect that. What about the rest? I said more than just celibate. I appreciate that you're on this journey, you're at that age, and, I'm sorry, but it's true, you're on a self-realization journey, - I'm not on that journey - been there done that. So, this is where you wanna be? And this is all you want? No, but I'm working on it. Okay so, let's work on it together. I know that I'm young, and I can't teach you anything, but let's try, old lady. But Dad. I won the competition. Yeah, third place. First place, dummy. They announce the winners third to first Yes, you won this time, but just barely made the deadline, you're such a procrastinator... But isn't the fact that I won enough? No. I'm not raising lazy kids who are satisfied with being average. You have to go after what you want in this life, and then you can have anything. Dad, I'm not lazy. Yes, you are. Procrastination is just another way of saying lazy, it's gonna stifle your dreams. But I'm gonna make you a success in spite of yourself. Shut up, dummy. You shut up, you shut up. No.. Hey, hey, hey, Maya! you're gonna sit here and argue right in front of me? She's a girl, you're a man. I expect more from you. I thought you were gonna bring me the computer? You've were on the phone for like two hours. Yeah, that's 'cause you were on the computer, That's why I need my own. Yeah you do. I've got an old one back there you can use if you want. Naw, man that's too slow. Would you be willing to invest in me in buying my own laptop? Nope. That's cold. Uh, no. Alright, hear me out. Look I talked to J.T., he said that he got one on sale, and it's cheap, you can afford it. I'm not your mother or your benefactor. I know, that you're not my mother. I got a mother, I don't need another one. Alright? So now you want me to start giving you money. Is that what you meant by build something? You know, I'm not some lonely old cougar looking for a young stud to take care of - a celibate one at that. No, I didn't say that. You're funny. What I'm saying is that, if you really care about me, then you should do that for me, help me out. So are you saying what I do now isn't help? No, I am not saying that, I appreciate what you do, I really do. I'm just asking for one more favor. You have to sign a promissory note. Thank you, baby. Hold up, hold up, not so fast. I'm still celibate. What's that? It's just something I am looking at. Tell me about it. There's nothing to tell. You realize you always do that. Every time I ask you about something or offer to help you shut me down, like some young kid who has nothing to offer. I'm genius with it. Like I got mad skills. It's this website that I'm obsessed with called the Nu project. Photos of just regular women. It tells so much about these women's struggles and triumphs, even failures. I'm sure I'm making way too much out of it, but I'm so intrigued. Oh, OK. Sounds intriguing. I need to pray. What are you doing? My dick is hard, that's means that's the devil trying to enter my body, I gotta pray. Thanks so much. You got here so fast. Yeah, my friend wasn't home, so I took an uber. Aww. It's so good to see you. You, too, Auntie. Look at you. You're all grown up. Hey Auntie, can we go inside? I really have to pee. You want something to eat? I got lots of leftovers. No thanks Auntie, I'm good, I already ate. What are you looking at? I am looking at our family. Oh my God, That was your father's 12th birthday. There is your grandma. Oh my God she is beautiful. And your grandfather, and that's me in the stroller. So cute, chubby cheeks. Yeah. My goodness. I'm gonna show you all these pictures, but for now, I wanna know what's been going on, I wanna here everything, how's school? School is okay. Just okay? Yeah, I had to drop a class to keep from flunking it. Still haven't told my mom yet. Why were you flunking? I don't know. I feel like, I just like couldn't focus. FOCUS, focus is overrated. I had to take the time, just got wrapped up in other artistic classes like painting and writing... And partying? And partying of course, just a little bit of that, but I love the artistic stuff and I hate math. I know it's so cliche, but I do. Ah yes, you got your grandfather's creative gene. Yeah, but I actually don't think I'm going to major in the arts. No? Yeah, I don't know, I think I'm gonna go into political science, I don't really know yet though. Like Mama. What are you talking about, Grandma was a bookkeeper. Yeah, but when she was in college, she was a political science major. And her mother was an activist in the 60s. She organized protests and rallies. I think she even got arrested a few times. How come I didn't know any of this? I don't know, I guess it's just one of those things we don't talk about. I guess, what about you Auntie? Me? No I didn't inherit that gene. The closest that I ever came to politics was when I dated a republican. What about your social life? Is there a boyfriend? Well, Auntie, I'm actually a lesbian. What, are you sure? When did that happen? I don't know, it just kind of, happened. OK, I feel you. No judgment. Thanks, it's good to have someone in the family on my side. Your father is not taking it too good? No, it's not him, it's my mom. My dad just kind of brushed it over. He's more upset about the tattoos. What tattoos? This one, this one. Zoe! Isn't it cute though? These are the years of finding yourself, so don't spend all your time trying to please everybody else, okay? Okay. So, tell me about this man friend you have? Man friend? Yeah, I saw men's deodorant in the bathroom and men's shoes in the bedroom. Oh. Well, He's not really, I guess he is a friend. I don't know if I should be telling you this. I'm almost twenty-one, you can tell me. Yeah he's kind of young too. Oh, Auntie are you a cougar? No, no. I hate that, uh I hate that. We're just friends, I'm helping him get into college. Like a tutor. Oh my God Auntie, is he in high school?! No. He's in his twenties. Twenties. Nice. So when I am gonna get to meet him. No, definitely not. What, why? He's, a little uncouth. If you weren't a lesbian now, I would not let you date him. Auntie that is so wrong. Okay so what's his name? Kaseem. But I call him little fella. Not to his face. yeah I know, I'm staying at my Auntie's right now. Yeah, I haven't seen her in a really long time, it's nice to see her. Yeah, shut up. Zoe, it's ready. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Yeah I don't know, she has this like um 22-year-old friend with benefits. Yeah, Nah, uh, she's not that old. She's like almost 40. No honestly I ain't even mad at her. Okay Okay, I will talk to you later. This smells really good Auntie, I thought you couldn't cook. Who says I can't cook? My dad, my mom and everyone else in the family. Wow okay, well you tell them I've been practicing. Okay? Let me know what you think. Auntie this is so good. It must be hard in college, there must be no good food. Oh my God, it is awful. Are you gonna get that or do you want me to get it? Um. No, I got it. Yeah, hey, what's up? I been calling you. I know. My niece came into town unexpectedly, and I spent the day with her. Oh, cool your niece, so let me meet her. No, you can't. Why not? She's just really young and she wouldn't understand. Understand what? I'm not good enough to meet your family? Just watch your language. I don't curse around my niece. Come on man, you so old fashioned. She probably curses more than you do. I really can't with you. But listen, swiping left and swiping right, is another way to minimize black women, 'cause they never get chose on those apps. I can agree to that. The simple fact that she's on a predominantly white site is just another knock against the black man 'cause she's now she must choose a white man. See that's a perspective. You know I'm right. I can't tell if you're crazy or if you're just full of crap You can say, shit. Go ahead, your aunt doesn't mind Not okay. She probably does all types of stuff when you're not around? I know she does. Yeah an she knows me pretty well. But you don't tell her everything. Because it's a sign of respect. Okay I've got a question for you, serious question, you got a boyfriend, right? I'm a lesbian. Not another one. Another lesbian? Another young woman that is blind. You just following a trend down a dark path. I'm telling you, if poverty doesn't kill our people, this homosexual activity will. OK, that's enough philosophical conversation for tonight. And I agreed with that. I'm going to bed, I have to leave early in the morning. I'm right behind you. Kaseem, it was really interesting getting to meet you. You, too, stay up and finish your education. If you gonna stay, you'll have to sleep on the couch. Word, no problem. I'd feel more comfortable if you didn't stay the night. Then why did you say I could take the couch? I don't know. Well my boy dropped me off, and there is no more train running back my way tonight. Okay but you gotta use the hall bathroom. What you think I'ma do something to your niece No, it's just a sign of respect like I said Yeah, okay, whatever. Good night. I take a blanket too, please? Oh my God, you scared me. Have a safe trip, okay? And seriously, stay at school - education is important. We need more of our brothers and sisters to graduate. Okay, I will. Hey, Tunde. Hey Maya, it's funny, I was just talking about you. Why? Well, I heard about the work you've doing with Marshall, Kaseem. Tutoring him or something like that? He needs that kind of support. He's a smart kid, he just needs some guidance. Especially with a family like his. I'm not, we're not, I don't know his family. Not surprised he didn't mention them. His Mom moved out of state running - from child protective services. - Why? He was breaking up a fight between her and her boyfriend and she cut him. She cut him? Intentionally? Yes - that's the kind of worthless woman she is. Then he gets bounced around between his grandmother and degenerate uncles then ends up in a shelter. That's horrible. Yeah, but you know what he, he has a really good heart. I hooked him up with my boy, Rashaad, down the block at the mosque to help him get his GED, you know that's part of his parole requirements. Four years in prison. It must be tough to away as a kid and come home an adult. Especially when you have no family to speak of. I hear now he has a baby on the way, something like that. You know what, I think I left something at home, it was good to see you though. Yo what's up, bae. Where my keys? It's on my key ring, why? I'm taking them. How, will I get in later? You won't. What's the problem? You just gave those to me, come on man, you too emotional for me. Is that what they taught you in prison? What? Yeah, I know you spent four years in prison. Who told you that? Does it matter, you saying you didn't? Marshall. I told you I changed my name to Kaseem. No, you told me it was your birth name. Why didn't you tell me you went to prison? I asked you and you lied. Because I knew this is how you would react. You hear a brother was incarcerated for drugs... No, not drugs I checked. Hold up, so you spying on me now? See that's the problem, black women don't know how to support a black man when it's absolutely necessary. Oh, don't give me that cliche bullshit, 'Cause this it the same black woman who bought you a computer, who feeds your ass and lets you stay in her house. But you're kicking me out now. Because you're a liar, and I realize I don't know anything about you. You don't wanna know, you're just like my family, you kicking a me when I'm down. So you can fuck me, but you can't support me Fuck you, we haven't fucked in forever because you want to be "celibate" and wanna build something. And I was the fool who agreed to it. What are those quotes for? Forget this, I'm not arguing with you, you have got to go. You know, I thought you were good for me, energizing. But now I realize, it was just a ball of confusion and frustration and lies. No, it's you, you're a loser, all you wanna do is be shacked up in this brownstone living off your savings, you keep living in the past man. You don't know shit about me. Look I didn't expect this to work out 'cause I'm Muslim so we have no future, but also, I was afraid that you'd hold me back. I know I lied about the jail thing... And your name, and school and the GED and the baby... I told you I don't have a baby. I don't believe you. I don't have a job, I don't have money, and sometimes not even a place to stay. But you know what, I'm out here everyday pushing and planning, towards my dreams and my goals. I don't live in my past and my time in prison don't matter. I don't want to be 39 and look back and all I have is memories. Enjoy your life man, 'cause I will. I hope you get your shit together. Yeah, hope you get your shit together. So, you weren't fucking anyway, what good was he? I swear I would have been told his ass to get lost. I don't know, there was something about his earnestness. He was hopeful, desperate. Something about him that made me feel almost maternal, like he needed my encouragement and support. OK, but what were you getting out of it? I don't know. I liked his company. So we're back to lonely. No, it was more than that we had great conversations, he was fun. Well, at least you had fun. Parts of it. On second thought, really, it was a lot of work. You love him? Not at all. I would tell you it if I did. It's like I was just reliving my twenties or maybe he was just something to do. I couldn't deal with his mood swings and his age. I don't know how other women deal with it. Then why does it look like you've been crying? Some of the things that he said. Breakups. Have I changed? What do you mean? Than when we were younger... then before my father died? Am I different? I don't know. Really you can tell me. You won't hurt my feelings. I think your father dying caused you to retreat a little. You were always a daddy's girl. You wouldn't do anything without worrying about what he would think. But get it, wanting to please your parents. Besides how could his death not affect you? Yeah My appointment is tomorrow. You want me to go with you? Hell yeah. Okay. I'm 200% percent sure. Okay. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday. Hello. Hey, baby bro. Hey, Maya. What's up? You know Zoe came to visit me. Wait, hold on, I can hardly hear you. I said, Zoe came to see me. I know she told me. She's such a beautiful young girl. You guys really raised her right, even though you aren't still together. Thanks. You alright? You sound like you've been drinking. Yeah, a little bit. She told me about your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. He's young. What's that about? Listen, that's not why I'm calling. I know you're giving Zoe a hard time about being a lesbian, but I think you should give her break. She needs time to figure out what her life is going to be. You hearing me? I'm here. She don't need anyone telling her what to do... Don't do that, Maya. Do what? I'm talking about Zoe. I don't know what's going on with you, but you seem to be drunk... And... And? A 22-year-old boy toy. You really know how to kill a buzz. You shouldn't be so high and mighty, which one of us had a baby while still in high school? Dad would've never let me get away with that. Our father, your father would be so ashamed of you right now. Wait, hello, hello. What happened? Mr. Ross' wife passed away. What? Yeah, she died in her sleep. We all gotta die sometime. Going in your sleep is as good as any. BOO! What the hell? Oh, sorry, excuse me. I thought you were someone else. I didn't, I... I'm.. Oh my god, you scared me. I'm so, so sorry. It's alright, I'm fine. Hey guys heeey, Lola, Lola Oh, I'm sorry I'm sorry, oh my God. She a girl, you are man, I expect more from you. It's something Maya is not gonna have because of her career Children? Yeah. You are beautiful just the way you are. See how that works? I knock, you answer, then I come in That's 'cause you don't have a key. I got pastries. Ohhh... Sock it to me cake. Oh, I wanted to try this. Looking good in here. So, this is what Harlem looks like. The new Harlem, yeah. So how you doing today? You mean am I still glad I did it? That too? 250 percent. Doesn't mean it was easy, but I'm sure it was the right thing for me. This shit is getting harder. What? Life. When you were young, you unnecessarily worried about making life-altering decisions, but at this age... It can all be life-altering. Right, it's now or never. You can't say I'll worry about that when I'm older. You are older. But 40 is still very young. I just keep thinking about Mrs. Ross, she lived to be 90 years old. Can you imagine seeing 90? Yes I can. I want to live to be 105. That gives me another 60 plus years. You're not asking for much. I am asking for much. And so should you. Do you want mediocre food? Pastries? Wine? Why accept a short mediocre life? Good point. But it can't just be longit has to be fulfilling. What's that Bob Marley quote? "It's not the length of life, but the depth of life." That's Emerson. Sounds like something Marley would've said. This is a heart attack waiting to happen. But it's sooo good. Yeah, hey, what's up? Yeah, hey, what's up? Long time. Yeah, long time. Spring cleaning? Something like that. I got something for you. Thanks, but I'm off scones. OK, trying new things. I like that. No, really, here. What's this? It's the money for the laptop. Really, I'm impressed. I said I would pay you back, and I'm a man of my word. It took me a minute. Plus, I wanted to apologize for not telling you the whole truth. You don't need to apologize. I'm trying to find my way. I don't have it all figured out, but I didn't lie about the baby, that was a rumor, I'd never deny a seed of mine. Like I said, you don't have to apologize. Besides, it wasn't all bad. It helps with the celibacy. You still doing that. I hit a few bumps but like I said, I'm a work in progress. And you're still the nicest old lady I know. Yeah, I better getting back to work. Right, spring cleaning. Oh by the way, looking good. Still thick as hell and that's a good thing. Yeah, I know and thank you. Thick.
