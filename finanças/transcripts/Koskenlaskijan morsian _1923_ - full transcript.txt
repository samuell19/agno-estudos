THE RAFTER?S BRIDE Based on the novel by V?in? Kataja Direction Photography Sets Produced by That Heikki of Paloniemi was the helmsman when the raft crashed into the rock face, drowning all men in the back, my only son Niilo Iisakki amongst them. "How are you managing here? Have you not heard from Paloniemi? "I am doing all right. They were going to send in some help from Paloniemi but I sent word that there?s no need. Mother Anna The famous preacher of North Bothnia, Kero-Pieti. Juhani of Paloniemi who, it was rumoured, would soon be proposing to Hanna of Nuottaniemi. "My young sister ? has the Lord a place in your heart?" "Your bygone mother was a true child of God." "Iisakki, my brother, how is your faith? Have you had the strength to resist temptation?" "You have hardened your heart. The Lord has given you a heavy burden ? your only son drowned ? drowned as a disbeliever. "Your neighbour has forgiven you everything, and wants to make better your friendship that has grown cold." "May the great mercy and boundless love of our Creator prevail over all of us." Heikki of Paloniemi, who was a known true Christian got elated, and started preaching too. "And most of all, we must live in mutual love and harmony, and not in hate and jealousy." "The master of Paloniemi surely has a clear conscience. In vain did I and father blame him for the drowning of Niilo Iisakki." "Hanna, do you have something particular against me as you are often so curt towards me?" It was midnight. Everyone was in bed except Iisakki and the preacher who were engaged in conversation." "So, let me know why it is that you hold a grudge towards your brother, Heikki of Paloniemi?" "I am not in a mood now to discuss my relationship with him." Hanna too was sleepless. "Kero-Pieti may be explaining to father that Heikki is without blame. Tomorrow would be a great day of reconciliation ?Juhani may come ?" Hanna felt pity towards Juhani, but not love ? no, for deep in her heart another image lingered ? for a long time already. It was Antti of Koskenalusta. "I am on my way to Lapland to fell trees." "Do remember me there." "I will remember you ? Always." "I will be back on the first rafts, and then it will be springtime." "He is quite the skier that Antti of Koskenalusta." She was badly waiting for spring to arrive. "We?ll soon be in late winter." "Hanna, for how long still will you keep me waiting?" "I did ask you to give me time till autumn to consider." There was no word from Antti all winter, and Juhani kept pressing. But then, one morning? "You are daughter Hanna of this Nuottaniemi house? I have some news from the timber forest, and a letter for you." "There are a couple of boys from this village working there too." "Right. Antti of Koskenalusta sends greetings. He is doing well, he is one of the top men." Many, many a time had she read Antti?s letter, but whenever she felt a longing in her mind she would read it again. I am writing this in a dark shelter, and the men are telling stories around me. I am thinking about you and the marvellous summer. ? ? Then, last summer, my happiest moment was to feel the gentle touch of your hand ? ? ? If only we could spend more happy summer evening moments together ? "Reconciliation might happen soon. Heikki has a young handsome son Juhani, a true Christian who loves your daughter Hanna." "He may be in love. But that is something for the young ones to decide." "Has Heikki asked you to be his spokesman and to thank Juhani with this?" "Evil is your heart, iisakki." "Peace of the Lord ?" ? I heard your father and Heikki be reconciliating, but I shall believe till the end of my days that had Heikki not delayed his rowing command, your brother would still be alive ? ? I wonder if you will remember me as you vowed, and will you wait till the summer when we will be at the shores of Nuottaniemi with the rafts? After the sermons at Paloniemi. "My sermons have thus far given me credibility." "Merciful Lord be praised if the ties of friendship between these neighbours I may strengthen. Speak your heart." "Iisakki, my brother, I know that your feelings have gone cold since your son Niilo was drowned on the raft I was helmsman of." "I hereby swear, in the presence of a preacher, that I am innocent." "I talked with my father about the drowning of Niilo Iisakki, and he swears that he himself does not know how the accident happened." "Why have you not offered an explanation earlier so I wouldn?t have hated you without cause ? I am sincerely sorry for my demeanour." "I for one believe my father innocent, and suggest that already at Midsummer, we will be wed." "It seems we hated the people of Paloniemi unjustly." "What if Heikki?s explanation is only accepted by the preacher and you?" "Heikki is a true Christian, he could not speak an untruth." "Did Heikki make any mention of Juhani?" "He said: my son is in love with your daughter, we both would overjoyed to see the Lord unite them." "But that surely is up to us two." "I am, too, of the same opinion." When Kero-Pieti had left, normal life at Nuottaniemi resumed. The rafts were being eagerly awaited, and Hanna would often stroll through the pine woods to the lake bank. Villagers from Paloniemi came to stay at Nuottaniemi for the duration of the rafting. "Listen Juhani, just in these vast forests of Nuottaniemi lies an immense fortune." Suddenly, the first cry was heard: Here come the first rafts! Even from afar Hanna could see that there was no man resembling Antti on the raft. As soon as they had attached the rafts, the men started towards Nuottaniemi "There will be more rafts arriving tonight already." "Yes, I was waiting him ? for several reasons." All day long, more rafts kept arriving. "Greetings again from North Bothnia. Antti too is on his way down from there on the next raft." "Your beds have been moved to the outbuilding." As the others were having a rest, Hanna was restlessly waiting for Antti. Hanna recognised Antti. Her heart started throbbing with joy. "Greetings from the Higher lands!" "I am glad that the Lord has guarded you on your way, and you return in good health." "Come, invite Antti in for something to eat. I am sure he would appreciate a bit of rest inside." "Going down the Korpikoski rapids is up to me and Juhani then, as you Iisakki intend to forgo helmsmanship." "I consider Antti of Koskenalusta brave and observant. He will become a fine helmsman." "We?ll give him a try this summer but I am of the opinion that he will fail." "Did you take for real what was said about me and Juhani of Paloniemi?" "Hearing about it I thought: Hanna will not deceive, nor lie, would not have held my hand asking to remember her, if she had thought about another." "I shall not deceive you, I shall not lie, and I have never thought about anyone else." "You must talk to father about Niilo Iisakki. He will best believe you because you too were on that raft." "Heikki is claiming his innocence, and your father believes it?" "I?ll talk to him as soon as we can do that in private." "And Iisakki too treated Antti like he were his best own son." "Antti shall share the destiny of Niilo Iisakki. I will get rid of him." "I must be clever. Juhani is to be on the same raft. Then nobody will suspect ? will have no reason to suspect. ?I?ll go straight into to the gorge of hell. The rapids hold their tongue. "And now off to the rapids boys!" "Let?s make an additional helmsman from Antti so the responsibility would not lie solely on Juhani and myself." "That?s true. Antti is very observant in the rapids. He?s been shooting down them from a very tender age." "You?ll start by coming along with myself and Juhani, first as a rower. We need more helmsmen now. "We?ll finish lunch first." "I am not afraid, I could have done this last summer, and even earlier." At the speed of an arrow, guided by Iisakki?s steady hand, the raft sped past dangerous rocks to aid those at foaming peril. "Row hard men, row hard!" Hanna knew that father and the men were doing their best but the rapids mockingly took a swirling hold of the raft. "Father, help!" "And my son too!" "A new effort must be made. We must steer the raft straight at the rock face." "Are there any of you rowing men?" "Cowards and scoundrels, that?s what you are!" The men had to fight all the night amidst the foaming rapids. But Hanna did not take a moment?s rest. At her suggestion, the raft was divided into two parts so it could be steered directly at the rock face. "Do you intend to join us?" "I do. My life has no more value than anyone else?s." "Will the rapids that I so love, be the doom of my both children." "Take course at the rock face!" The raft skidded the rock, and in an instant were the men safe. Safe! "Steer towards the right waterway!" As the raft was floating down the calmer waters, the men and Hanna relaxed and bursted with an overwhelming joy of life. Antti?s home. "Hanna is s veritable daughter of his father, just as brave as he was in his days. "Who?s counting! One rapids takes so many, another more. Who knows which ones of us will be taken, and we won?t be missed for long. To the waters, men!" "Are you saying that Heikki intended to wipe out Antti the same way he did your dead son?" "Everything Heikki does is premeditated, that?s what I believe, so help me God!" "I am also sure of that. He was helmsman when Niilo Iisakki drowned." "And I always believed Heikki to be a true Christian. The Lord works in mysterious ways." "It is her the men have to thank for saving their lives." Iisakki felt a deeper love for his child than ever before. "And one jumped in the rapids while the others were shouting we?re doomed!" Time passed ?. Antti was now a helmsman at Korpikoski and lived at Nuottaniemi. "I?ve been thinking, Antti. You should stay on with us for the summer." "I am not afraid of him, I have never wished him ill. But I cannot help loving you and always wanting to love you." "Do you know what your father told me?" "He said he needed more men for the fields and that I should stay for the summer ? if I can agree on that with you." "Antti!" "One jumped in the rapids while the others were shouting we?re doomed!" "I cannot hate him, I pity him, having lost everything, his father, home, you, and finally his mind." On a Sunday, Kero-Pieti arranged a revival meeting at Nuottaniemi. "Was it his father drowning, or losing Hanna that drove Juhani to insanity? Antti thinks it is due to the perils at Varsankallio. "Although we do not know what the Lord means by these terrible accidents, our faith tells us that Heikki of Paloniemi ? ?" "You are saying ?earth to earth? even though in the rapids you drowned ? ?" "Did you see where he went? Ran into the rapids, did he?" "Hanna!" "One jumped in the rapids while the others were shouting ? ?" "? we?re doomed!" "We come too late." Kero-Pieti categorically stopped arranging revival meetings any more. "I cannot grasp the meaning of the Lord. Mysterious are the ways of the Lord. It feels like all the misfortune in Paloniemi is my fault." "May God?s peace be with you!" Translation by Mikko Kuutti / KAVI, 2020
