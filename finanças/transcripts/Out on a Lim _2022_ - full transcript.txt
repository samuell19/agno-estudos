Because if you cared about him, you would've left the drugs and the women alone, long enough to show up in his life and be a father to him. - Come on, now. 'Causing a scene out here for these people. Now, you know I wanted to be there for my son. - No, I brought him his first football. I had brought him his first pair of cleats. All my son ever wanted was to look out in those stands and see his father cheering him on. - We used to be good together. - My son may have gotten his talent from you, but that's all he's ever gotten from you. And do me a favor, the next time you think that you wanna try and help me with something, don't. Goodbye, Teddy. - Pearl, why you wanna be like that?

Maybe you didn't look at the plan. It's all there. Repayment, timeline, required, details. What's the problem? - It's an impressive plan. One of the more thorough plans I've seen, but I'm afraid without collateral, the banks unwilling willing to take the loan. - If I had collateral, I wouldn't need a loan. Come on, man. I'm here 'cause I ain't got shit. Look, look, sir. I got a plan. I got a vision. I'm willing to do the work. I just need a little push please.

Do you think you mean more to my son than I do? I'm the only family he has. I've been a mama and a daddy to him. - Okay, so I'm his girlfriend, the mother of his child. - So what you think you're special? You ain't nothing but another one of them, gold diggers running after these boys that play ball, trying to catch 'em. If Limmie was not a football player, you would've not given my son the time of day. - Limmie ain't got shit to chase after. I'm with him because I love him and believe in him. Limmie knows that. And whether you like it or not, he loves me too. You know what this room is for family only. And right now, I'm the only family he has. So get out. - Limmie is a man now with his own family.

Hey. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's perfect now. - Sir, can we ask you a few questions private, please? - Sir, we have a few questions to ask you about a robbery that took place the night that you were shot. - What kind of questions do you have? I already told the staff here, I don't remember anything. - Well, we interviewed a robbery victim, whose home was robbed the same night you were checked in. She stated that her security shot one of her assailants, but he got away. It's a helluva coincidence that you just happened to get shot the same night. - I don't know anything about a robbery. I was on the way home and some guys jumped me. The next I know, I woke up here. I don't remember shit else. - Sir, I know you're under a lot of stress. We don't mean to upset you. Listen, I already told my partner that I don't think it was you. Still remember what you did for me in middle school at Mount Zion. You've got a good heart. - Huh? - You don't remember me, do you? We went to school together, man. It's me, Danny. Dirty Danny. Kids used to tease the hell outta me, how I was just some poor white trash, that didn't never bother anybody. I used to come to school with these beat up shoes, soles coming apart, could see my socks through the cracks. And even they had holes in them. The other kids, they, you know how kids can be, man, they're cruel. This guy, one day he just comes in with a brand new pair of shoes. Told me he didn't wear 'em anyways. Couldn't believe this guy. - I mean, it was nothing dir- I mean, Dan, I had a bunch of shoes anyway and I never really wore 'em. I just didn't like how the kids was treating you. - I don't know. He does fit the body type. And was shot around the time the victim says a guard shot her assailant. I know y'all have history, but procedure- - I'm telling you, he's a good guy. He always has been, listen, get some rest, take care of yourself. Take care of that baby. Hold her tight. Show her all the love you have. Guys like us, we never had that. It's major being a dad. - So we done here? - I think that 'bout wraps it up. Get some rest brother. - Found your guy. Scumbag's just got out of a coma and get this, He just had a kid. His girlfriend was there with the baby. I suggest you and your people get outta here and finish this piece of shit. - Hey, dipshit. No personal calls at work. - Tell your wife to stop calling me during work hours, bro. - I'll catch up to you later, man. - All right.

But you wanna know what's more dangerous than both? I tell you, it's a woman who's been scorned. So let me make this clear. Hell have no fury like what I plan to do to your family, if I don't get my motherfucking money. - Lady, please just- - [Shirley] I'll call you in 12 hours. - I guess this is why they said money's a root of all evil. - Nah, the love of money is the root of all evil. - Well that evil bitch killed my girl?

I mean, we have it right here. - We have the communication between the two, but to establish her as the boss, it's going to be a little tricky, we're gonna need his cooperation. - That makes sense.
