- Tennessee Williams, 'The Catastrophe of Success'. In the public, somebody you are when you have a name is a fiction created with mirrors. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENING] [FOOTSTEPS] - Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow. A poor player, struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. - Are you death? - It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. You really are just a blip on the map. A flash of light extinguished by the coal blackness of reality. - Am I dead? - If you were, I wouldn't be here. Nothing would. I exist for you. - Why won't you let me die? - [LAUGHS] Because you are not finished yet. - I have nothing left. - I am your muse. [MUSIC] [PHONE RINGING] - Cheryl will be right with you, Mr. Sait. - Alright. - Can I get you anything while you're waiting? Water, coffee? - Coffee'd be great. - Right away. It's great to see you again. You probably don't remember me. The last time you were here, I'd just started working. - Right. - I love your books and your movies. I love everything you do. Till Death is my favorite. - Somebody liked it? - Who cares what the critics think? I'm not just... - Kennedy, look at you! - Cheryl. How are you? - Fabulous. - Let me get your coffee. Cream and sugar? - Just black fine. Gotta stay healthy. - I've got to say, it's nice to see you sober. - Had my share of demons. - I hope you're here to tell me that you've buried them in this new book. - No, demons are personal. I've tried to make my art personal. I won't make that mistake again. - Here you go guys. - Thanks. - Leave the business to me. You're the artist, I'm the agent. People like personal and relatable. - Come on Cheryl. People don't want personal. They want the illusion of personal because the reality, it's just too real. They want the public persona, not the reality. And that truth is already stacked on a lie. No. This is me in my most misanthropic. What the hell is wrong with me? PATRICIA: You're insane. - Patricia. [DOG BARKING] - Get back in the car. We should talk about this. [DOG BARKING] - You don't own me, Doug. You never have. - Get off your high horse, you spoiled bitch. And how far you gonna get in that car? Huh? My car. Just like this is my house, my clothes, my jewelry. You got nothing, Trish. - I've got my pride you piece of shit. - Your pride is worthless sweetheart. - I'm gonna clean you out. - And that there, that right there is exactly why you signed a prenup baby. You get nothing because you are nothing. - You can't treat me like this. - I can treat you however I want and no one will question. [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] - Kennedy, can I help you? - Can I help you? [CHUCKLES] - Sorry if we disturbed you. I can be a bit of a bitch sometimes. - Listen. If you ever feel unsafe for any reason, just come to my place. I always keep the back door unlocked. - It's really not as bad as it sounds. Every couple fights. - Come to my place. Nobody deserves that. - Who's there, hon? Kennedy? - Douglas? - What can we do you for? - It's nothing. - We're talking, honey. Well? - Well, Douglas, why don't you try treating your wife like a lady? - I do treat her like a lady. I buy her things. All the things in the world. I shower her with gifts, everything. - Doug, please, Ken was just coming... - Goddamn it, Trish, we're having a conversation here. - See, now Douglas, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Don't treat her like that. - Why don't you mind your own business? - Maybe I'm making it my business. - Oh, mister high and mighty. - At least I don't hit women. - Neither do I. What the fuck have you been telling people? - Well, no, I never said anything like that. Why would you say that? Doug has never hit me. - It's only a matter of time. - Get off my property before it hit you. You son of a bitch. - Look, I heard you arguing up front and I just wanted to see if everything was OK. - We're fine. Why don't you go check on dinner, will you? Don't make a thing out of something that's nothing. - I'm just, I'm a concerned citizen. - We've been neighbors a long time, huh? - About 10 years? - Wow, 10 years. You know, I remember when you and your family first moved in. in case I never said anything, I'm sorry about your loss. And believe me, I know it's been hard on you. I see all the shit going on at your place. - Excuse me? - All the derelicts and degenerates coming and going at all hours of the night. - Listen, if you think... - Hey, it's none of my business. Just like anything you think you see or hear here is none your business. Got it, neighbor? Freak. - There is no drug more addictive or satisfying than that of creation. Embrace the emotion. Don't fight it. Pain is your guide. [MUSIC] - Hey you. - Melanie. - In all my glory. You like it? - Huh? - Are you kidding me, Kennedy? You asked me to dress like this. - Yeah, I got caught up in some work. - Fine. These shoes are killing me anyways. Is it about that girl? - What girl? - The neighbor that you're obsessed with. - Sort of. - Sort of? - Same girl, different angle. - Let's say it's about time for a union break. - Gotta strike while the iron is hot. - It's not 'H', it's coke. It'll actually help with an all-nighter. - I've got to keep my mind clean. That's the problem, I need to focus. - Sure? Yeah, no, yeah. You're just gonna quit, just like that? - I need to focus. - I already bought your party favours for next month. OK, and cheers to you if you're on the wagon, but you're still paying me. - Fine. - When do you want it? - No, sell it to someone else. Double your profits. - Really? - Yeah. - So, I guess this means we're done with our monthly visits? - Mm-hmm. - Unless of course you come to the club visit me, get a dance. - Yeah. - Or what do you say we have some fun first, for old times' sake? I'll let you call me Patricia, if it helps. Are you getting in? - No, I have work to do. - Say again? - It's time for you to leave. - OK, let me cut you off right there. You know what I need to hear. So, don't call back until you can say it. Puta. [PHONE RINGING] [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] - Lindsey, I've been putting out fires all day. So, this better be good. - You have a call, Kennedy Sait. - Is he high? - No, he sounds happy and sober. [PHONE RINGING] - This is quite a surprise. Last time we talked, you wanted out of your contract because of you quit writing - And I meant it. Tried channeling all that pain into my work and the world tore me apart. Put myself in a vulnerable position and what do I get? Worse sales, worse reviews. I was done. - So, you've got something? Great, swing by the office. - No, not yet. Maybe in a couple of weeks. I just wanted to call and let you know that I'm not dead. And in fact I'm back. - Well, the world needs your voice. - I'll swing by at the end of the month, see if we can make work. - Oh, we'll make it work and we'll get that movie deal back too. - Baby-step, Cheryl. - Alright then. Get back to work. - Yeah, I'll see you soon. Patricia. Oh my God. Come in. Come in, please. Are you OK? [SOBBING] - Did Doug do that to you? [SOBBING] Son of a bitch. - I just had to get out of there. I didn't know where else to go. - So, he's still over there? - No. [SOBBING] He left after he hit me. [SOBS] I'm scared. [SOBBING] - Come here. - What am I gonna do? - Here, sit down. Can I get you an ice pack or something? You feel sick or nauseous? - No. Do you have peas? - Huh? - Frozen peas. They're better for a black eye. - Oh, you're an expert in black eyes? - Well, if you grew up with my father then yeah you'd know a thing or two about covering shit up. - Is this the first time that Doug's hurt you like this? - I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry. - Wait. No, wait. Please, don't go. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just cannot let you go back to that. Remember you saved me once too. How about I get you those peas? Alright, have a seat over here. - I was supposed to meet my friend Carla for drinks at... Oh shit. She's going to wonder why it didn't show up. I have to use your phone. I left mine at home. - What are you doing? I can explain. It's not what it looks like. - It looks fucked up. Don't come near me. - Patricia, I would never hurt you. Never. - You're stalking me? - You saved me. - What? - When I try to kill myself, you're always there. You always brought me back because you knew I wasn't finished. - What the fuck are you talking about? - You, you're my muse. - Look, we can forget about this, OK? I'll just leave. And I never saw the photos and it's all good. - No. No, I can't let you go back to that. He'll hurt you. - No, he won't. It's OK. I'll be fine. - Patricia, this is for your own good. I can't let you get hurt. - Get off me. - Trish. [SOBBING] - I'm so sorry. This is no way to treat you. [SOBBING] It's OK. It's OK. - It's not OK. - You don't understand. - You fucking kidnapped me. - Trish, I told you that was for your own good. - Please. [SOBS] I know you didn't mean any of this. You can let me go. It was just a joke. I get it. - No, you don't get it. This is bigger than both you or I. Years from now, when we're both dead and buried, the written word, that'll live on. Books, movies, music, art. It's the only thing that really lasts. - What are you talking about? - I can't lose you. I need you. - You need help, - Patricia, you did help me. You are my muse and I cannot finish this story without you. [SOBBING] I'm sorry I didn't, I didn't plan it this way. I'm just in the middle of something really big right now all thanks to you. - Wait [SOBS] Kennedy, I can give you money. I'll pay anything. You know I have it. - Money isn't worth what you can give me. - No, no, no! [SOBS] - Think about it. [SOBBING] - What is that? - This is going to be uncomfortable. I don't wanna hurt you. - People are gonna be looking for me. - But they won't find you. [SOBBING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] - Is this seat taken? - Hello, Melanie? - Around here my name is Persephone. - Cute. - I don't do cute. I do goddess. - Hey, can I get you guys anything? - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - Oh, new friend, we need drinks. Have a vodka tonic. - And for you? - Diet Cola. - Alright. - Kennedy, if you wanna meet me on my turf, you got to play the role. - Alright, girl. And what role is that? - That you're a stranger. That you're here for a drink. That you're here for a dance. You're here for a party. - Welcome Melanie, I mean Persephone. The reason why I'm here is because I need something. - I got all you need, baby. You know, I could have just come to your house after work to see you. - You know the reason why I started coming here years ago? - Why? - It's because it's some place that I could run away and hide in where no eyes are on me. Nobody cares that I'm here. I'm invisible. Just hiding in the crowd. - You can be alone without being alone, Kennedy. Listen, I get off in a couple hours if you want... - Melanie, you can't come by my house anymore. - Now you got a new girl. She'll be jealous. - Yeah, something like that. - [SIGHS] You still need me, huh? - I just need some... - No, Ken, I get it. OK, I get it. You just need to use me. - No, Melanie, it's nothing like that. Seriously. WAITRESS: Your drinks. - Why don't you pay the nice lady and we'll go have some fun? WAITRESS: Thank you so much. MELANIE: Keep the change. [SIGHS] Come on. - Do you have any sleeping pills? - Sleeping pills? - Yeah, I can't sleep well lately. - Well, maybe you got to see a doctor about that. - No, it can't be on the record. My agent can't find out. And it needs to be strong. - OK, well, I mean I can try to get some Triazolam for you. - Good. - It's not here. Let's go. - Hello Ken. - Doug. - I was wondering, have you seen my wife around? - Sure, the last time I saw her, she was over there in your front porch, and you were yelling at her. - Is that some kind of joke, son? - Do I look like I'm laughing? - Look, my wife is missing. - Maybe she came to her senses. - Goddamn it, Ken. This is serious. - I am serious, Doug. I see you arguing and yelling and treating her like your fucking possessions over there. Now, how can you be surprised that she might have left your pompous ass? - Maybe I'm not the greatest husband in the world. If I was, I wouldn't have had three wives. I bury myself in my work because every time I try to be a family man, I find some way to fuck it up. - Right. Well, I'm not your therapist, but here's a hint. Regret, it's pointless. So, you need to live your life without her, OK? Now I'm sure wherever she is, she's better off. DOUG: I don't wanna trade punches. None of her family has heard from her, and all of her clothes, her cell phone, everything is still at home. If she took off, she would have at least packed a suitcase. - Sure. - Well, look, if you think of anything, can you please let me know? And by the way, I'm sure the police will be in touch at some point. - Good morning? - What did you inject me with? - Hmm, you should eat. You need to keep your strength up. - Fuck you. - How many times are we going to go through this? Look, I know this is difficult for you. It's difficult for me too. - [SCREAMS] - There are two ways that we can deal with this. You'll get this back when you calm down. - What? Are you punishing me? I'll piss all over your floor. - What, did you forget your...? - Surprise! - Shit. - You still like it with lots of cream, lots of sugar? - You know it. Are you OK? - Well, now that you mention it, I am a little bit worried. See, my niece, she just shows up out of nowhere. Don't get me wrong. I love seeing her. But I can't help but be a little worried when she just shows up unannounced like this. - Perhaps your niece remembers her uncle telling her that if ever she needed to, she could come stay here. - What's up Jade? - I tried calling you a couple of times. I finally came out to my mom. You know what? You were wrong. She has no fucking idea. You know, I don't even think it's me liking girls that bothers her. I think what's worse for her is the idea that I won't be bringing a boy home for her to meet and then marry and pump out grandkids. It's like it's the end of the fucking world 'cause I'm not gonna be a carbon copy of her. Whatever. She kicked me out 'cause she thought the way I naturally express love is sick and wrong. And so, since this shithole is a little better than the streets, I'm here to take you up on that offer. - You, you can't stay here, Jade. I'm sorry. You just can't. - Wait, what? But you said. - I said that a year ago. - I didn't realize there was an expiry date on that offer. Yeah. It was a year ago, wasn't it? It's when I first came out. And it was to you. Because I thought you were the one fucking person in this family who'd actually understand. - I remember. - You hugged me and told me that when I was ready to come out to my mom, you had my back. - It's just this work thing that I have right now, Jade. It's really big and it's... - Seriously? I mean, look at the fucking size of this place. You wouldn't even see me. You know what? Fine, whatever. If that's what you want. - What about a friend's place? Wouldn't you rather stay there? - You think I haven't already thought of that? Trust me. If I did, I wouldn't be here. Uncle Kennedy, I need your help. You know when Aunt Sarah died, I remember bringing you food because you got so thin. You looked really fucking rough. I wasn't sure if when I showed up today, you'd be alive or not. Please, Uncle Kennedy. - Aaah. Alright. Alright, fine, fine, you can stay. - Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. - OK, OK, ground rules. - [SIGHS] - Like I said, I'm working on something really big important right now. So, you can't just be running all over the place, alright? You can have the guest room on the second floor. And this is temporary. I don't want you and your mom drifting apart over this. - So, you wanna go to the attic and jam? - No, no. The studio is not even up there anymore. That's it's my new workplace. So, attic's out of bounds. How about I show you your new bedroom? - Geez, better than a hotel. - Mi casa su casa. Well, I'll let you get settled. I got something to take care of. - Hey, thank you. Seriously. - You're welcome. KENNEDY: [SIGHS] This is good. This is really coming together, like really coming together. - Then what? - Huh? - You keep writing and I keep inspiring. Then what? You finish the book, unlock me and I go home? Or is it by that point that I fall in love with you when we ride off into the sunset? - Damn it, Trish, one thing at a time, OK? This is important. - I escaped one monster just to fall into the trap of another. - I am nothing like your husband. - You are worse. [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] - Can I help you? - May I come in? - Have a seat. - I will. Thank you. - Is everything OK? - No, Mr. Sait, everything is not OK. I'm not in the habit of showing up when things are OK. - Right. No, I just meant, do you need something? Can I get you anything? - Coffee. - No coffee in the house. Sorry, staying away from caffeine. - Decaf? - No. - Tea? - Nope. - Do you have any pie? - Look, no offense detective, but I'm really busy here. So, if you could just... - Of course, yeah, we'll dispense with the pleasantries. I'm sure you're aware either through your local newscast or your neighbor Doug Bailey that his wife Patricia has gone missing. - Yeah. Doug came by earlier asking if I saw anything. DETECTIVE: Did you? - No. No, I keep to myself. Hide out in here and work on my art. - Right. I've read all your books, Mr. Sait. I'm a fan. KENNEDY: Really? Would you like an autograph? - No. When was the last time you spoke with Patricia? - I don't know. Only met her a few times. Doug's had a couple of wives since we've been neighbors. And they just keep getting younger. KENNEDY: Patricia has been around for maybe a year or two. Actually, now that I think of it, they were arguing outside maybe a week ago. - And what was that regarding? - I don't remember. Like I said, I keep to myself. DETECTIVE: But you're certain that they were fighting? - Yeah, I was married, I know what an argument sounds like. - Where's your wife now? - She died. A drunk driver took her and our little girl. - I'm sorry for your loss. What kind of guy is Doug Bailey? - I don't know. He's alright. A bit of a hard ass. He would... - Would what? KENNEDY: No, it's nothing. - Mr. Sait, a woman's missing. Nothing is nothing. - Well, one time they were arguing outside and I heard her threaten to leave him and he said that she'd never get a dime of his. Not a penny. He'd see to it. And then he said, he'd rather spend his money on making her disappear than to lose it in court. - That's a very deliberate thing to say. It's odd. Make her disappear. KENNEDY: Maybe, I guess. - Well, think of it this way. If someone said, "I will kill you." Well, that can get put down to just a figure of speech, right? But if someone says, "I'm going to stab you three times in the chest." It's odd. KENNEDY: Sure. - And now she's missing. When did this happen? - Look, I've known Doug for quite a while. It's probably nothing. - Like I said, Mr. Sait, nothing is nothing. [MUSIC] - They wouldn't understand. [MUSIC] You're always there for me. WOMAN 1: So, what do you have for us? MAN: Oh, I read that latest novel from Kennedy Sait. WOMAN 1: Oh, that doesn't bode well. MAN: Listen, I don't enjoy trashing people's work, but I have to call it like I see it. And this is a big flaming car wreck. The quality of this new book is sadly on the same pompous and whiny level as that driveling film career that he tried to have. Even his loyal fans are probably crossing the street to avoid him right now. WOMAN 1: Oh, wow, you're never going to mince words. OK, we'll look at your... - Fuck. Why do I get punished for wanting to make fucking entertainment? Fuck them all. [SOBS] You want a car wreck? Show you a fucking car wreck. My God. I almost hit you. - Well, someone was watching over me, I guess. - No, you don't understand. I almost hit you. I'm sorry. - Here sit down. - What's wrong with me? - Maybe someone's watching over you too. - Why? - If you actually got out on the road, it could have been way worse. - I could have killed you. - But you didn't. - But it could have. - And everything happens for a reason. So, I'd like to think that I just saved someone else just then. I got some of your mail by mistake. I'm Patricia, Doug Bailey's wife, Helluva way to meet, huh? - You just saved me. Are you an angel? - Well, I've been called worse. So, I'll take it. Now give me your keys. - They're in the car. - OK, well, this is what we're gonna do. You're gonna go inside and get some sleep and I'm gonna grab your keys and you can get them back tomorrow. Deal? - Thank you, Patricia. - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - It's a beautiful neighborhood that you live in. KENNEDY: Planning on moving in? - No. These houses, too much upkeep for one guy. How do you do it? - I guess I just have a lot of time on my hands. - Speaking of that, my partner and I have been canvassing the area. And I tried to stop by your house. - I come here a lot. It's relaxing. My wife Sarah, she used to bring our little girl here. They'd spend hours. So peaceful. - I'm sorry to interrupt your moment of Zen. However, I'd like to speak to you again about Patricia Bailey. - You got any leads? - Oh yeah. And I'm investigating every one of them. One in particular though. - I don't know what you're talking about. - See, one of your neighbors had suggested that they'd seen you being friendly with Patricia, chatting, flirtatious even. - Maybe, I guess. - She was a beautiful woman. - Sure. - And you said that you didn't know her well. - And I don't. It doesn't mean I'm not friendly with my neighbors. - Flirtatiously friendly? - She's attractive. I'm a guy. So, what? - Just following up on all the leads, no matter how crazy they might seem. - And can I ask you? Who told you this? - It doesn't matter, Mr. Sait. We just wanna find Patricia. - Do you wanna know what I think? - I'd love to. - I think that she left him. Simple as that. - Occam's razor? - Exactly. - I hope so, Mr. Sait. I really hope so. JADE: Yeah, he was being a total prick at first. I actually thought I might be sleeping behind a dumpster tonight, but I worked my magic and now I'm in a mansion. [LAUGHS] You know, it's really too bad though. I mean one guy in this huge house. It just seems like a waste. You know, I have made good use of it and I snag some of the things I know he's not gonna use. WOMAN 2: Wow. - It's all so fancy. But I was thinking I would make him a little thank you breakfast considering. WOMAN 2: So, your payment's morning after breakfast? - You know it baby. Jade's classic huevo ranchero. Who could resist? I know you can't. WOMAN 2: I don't believe it. - OK, well, I'll see you tomorrow, right? WOMAN 2: Got it. - OK. Bye. WOMAN 2: Bye. - Oh, God, Kennedy. - This is your body reacting to coming off the morphine. - Kennedy, please, I can't do this. - No, I can't do this. Do you think that this is easy? Patricia, this is a lot and a lot of work and concentration. OK. Oh, OK, I know, I know I'm just still having these mood swings. I'm getting sober. So, I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy for you either. So, I do apologize. But we cannot turn back time. So, you and I have to make the best of this situation. - I am chained to a wall covered in vomit. You tell me how to see the glass half full. [MUSIC] - I'm not trying to make you suffer. This was my wife's dress. I think it'll look great on you. - Can I take a shower? - For now, I'll get you cleaned up and out of those dirty clothse. - I have been trapped up here for God knows how long in the same clothes. I'm a mess. I just want a shower. - Earn one then. For now, I'm doing the best that I can. So, how about you appreciate that? [MUSIC] - Well. - What? - You need to take the chain off so I can take these tights off. [MUSIC] Do you have a change of underwear? [MUSIC] - Mmm. - Ssh. - The conflict of an artist's struggle is akin to that of a Shakespearean tragedy for an audience absent to the misery. KENNEDY: I didn't ask for this. - They never do. - I got nothing left except you. I can't even get that right. - Do the work. The muse works for you. Not the other way around. [MUSIC] - Oh, surprise! I made you breakfast. - Huh. Looks pretty damn good. Jade, when did you learn to be such a good cook? - You should try my chicken and waffles. I make it with side collards and then gravy from scratch. - Seriously, you should go to school for this. - Hmm, no. I like to cook for friends and family, but not for a living. - Yeah, you wanna be a rock star? - Maybe I'll follow in your footsteps. I always loved storytelling. - It's a lonely life. - Only if you want it to be. - Hmm. Success is an illusion, Jade. Take any other job out there. You're a cook. Make a steak, medium rare. It's either right or wrong. You have a desk job, clicking numbers into a spreadsheet. It's either right or wrong. But the arts... - What? - We create without knowledge and the answer is opinion, not fact. - Well, I would rather create art that is up for debate and sparks conversation rather than living chained to a desk suffering the monotony of black and white reality. - Don't let it fame fool you kiddo. It's hyper reality at best. - What does that mean? - There's the 'reality me'. The man I look at in the mirror every morning and there's the other version, the famous writer, the artist. Sometimes it's hard to differentiate between the two. And that blurred line is the hyper reality. And sometimes when you can't tell the difference between them, it can be a dangerous world. Sorry, I'm rambling. I was up late working last night. - Yeah, you're rambling. But don't apologize. I get it. You know, I used to pretend that I was exactly what my mom wanted me to be. And that wasn't a life worth living. And then I finally made the decision to put myself first and get what I want or at least that's what I'm trying to do. So, do you have any other words of wisdom on how to get that done? - Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. [FOOTSTEPS] - Oh, hi? - You're off then? - Yeah. But I was wondering, a woman went missing in the neighborhood? - Really? How'd you find that out? - Local news. - Oh, that thing. - Yeah. Futures a scary. - Leschi detectives are investigating the disappearance of Patricia Bailey. Leschi woman who has been missing for two weeks. - Do you know her? - Yeah, I've seen her around. She probably just left her husband. He's not the greatest of people. - Oh. I work after school, so I probably am not gonna be home till late. - That's fine. Just give me a heads up when you're on your way. - Bye Ken. - It's fine, Jade. Have a good day. - Hi kid. - Is she a little young for you? - She's my niece. What are you doing here? - I got fired from the club. They caught me dealing so I'm gone. I just need some cash, Kennedy. I wanna sell you what I got. KENNEDY: Not interested. - Don't do this to me. I know that you're off the wagon. - What part of not interested did you miss? - Fine. - What if I let you fuck me? - We are done, Melanie. Got it? - [SOBS] You can't just use me whenever it's convenient for you. You piece of shit. - Get the fuck out of here. - You think you can just throw me out with the trash? You're trash too pal. Quit pretending that you are something that you are not. Deep down, you are just like me. - No, this is me at my most misanthropic. This is who they want me to be, so this is what they get. I've embraced this hideous bitch goddess. - Well, you may have quit drinking, but you sure as hell sound drunk. - None of this matters to you. I get it. All you need to know is that is that I've captured my muse and she's giving me all the inspiration in the world. - A man who dares to waste one hour of time, has not discovered the value of life. - Anything you say can and will be held against you in the court of law. - This is bullshit, you hear me? - You have the right to an attorney. - I didn't do anything. How do you even know if she's dead? - If you can't afford one, one will be appointed for you. - I want my lawyer. Call my lawyer, damn it. - Well, you can call your own lawyer. [PANTS] - Having a bad day? - Don't. Don't pretend to care. - I'm not pretending. I also don't care. How long have I been up here? Two weeks, three, a month? Christ, I'm waiting to get my period just so I can start keeping track of time. I need to keep my sanity because I won't let you break me. And if that means meaningless chitchat about your problems, then so be it. - My problems? Have you ever worked a day in your life? Because I followed you around a lot and you cannot relate. - I can relate to pain. I can relate to regret. - Really? - Do you think as a little girl, I grew up wanting to be taken care of? I put myself through school because I wanted to make something of myself I had dreams too. I never went around looking for this life. I didn't ask to be spoiled. Everyone thought I was so lucky too. Fairy tale life. That's how I can relate to you. You're famous. Everyone assumes that your life is perfect. Champagne and parties, you get everything you want. But the moment you fuck up, everyone is on you like a vulture. Believe me, I get that. I know exactly what it's like to be you. - See, you ever read the story about the hunter who lost his arms in an accident? Every night, he would go to sleep and he would dream that he still had them. He could play catch, drive a car, hug. But then in the morning, he would wake up and for a few moments, he would forget that he lost them, his arms. And he had to realize over and over again just what he lost. Sure, maybe I used drugs and booze to deal with the stress of fame. It wasn't until I lost my family that I went over the edge. I hated sleeping, I hated being awake, I hated everything in between. And time, it doesn't do a fucking thing. You saved my life, and now my salvation is your suffering. That's not fair. - If I'm your muse, start treating me like one. - OK. I'll bring you a bowl of water and a sponge. Maybe a toothbrush? - Really? No, Kennedy, I wanna take a bath. I wanna soak in a tub and I want to wash my hair. Please? - OK, I guess we have time. - What are you doing? - I love you Trish. You're going to get your bath, But come on, I can't trust you. - No, Kennedy, please. You can't keep drugging me like this. - But it's the only way. Now let's get that bath started for you. Jade? Jade? Jade, did you come home? Jade? Jade? - Don't fucking move. - Melanie? - Yeah, baby. - The door was locked. - Oh, yeah. You remember three years ago when you went to rehab and you gave me a key? Yeah, I made a copy. Never trust a junkie. - What do you want? - Money, Kenny, money. Lots of it. What can I say? I'm kind of in between jobs at the moment. - You can take as much money as you can carry out of here. I don't care about the money. - You're such a hypocrite. Kenny. You create so many characters for yourself, so many personalities. Do you even know what the real Kennedy Sait is? Where's the money? Where is it? - I keep a safe in the attic upstairs. - Which way? - Ah! [GUNSHOT] [PHONE RINGING] - Not now, Jade. [MUSIC] - Uncle Kennedy. [MUSIC] - Patricia? [MUSIC] [YELLING] - I can explain. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [MUSIC] [SOBBING] - You're woman from the photographs. - You killed him. - You killed my uncle. - Your uncle was a very sick man. - He was a good man. - You don't know the truth. - He was a good man. - He was once. - And what do you want? - I wanna disappear. Start over. JADE: Then leave. Go. [MUSIC] - Well, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. - I always wanted to follow in my uncle's footsteps. - You certainly write like he does. - He was a great inspiration of mine. I wanted to share his suffering, his triumphs, and ultimately his tragedy. - The story is captivating. I mean, I can't even tell what parts are true events and what parts are fictionalized. - Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. [MUSIC]
