Don't know the word for that. Alienation? Estrangement? Incompatibility? Nah, those ain't right. But there's gotta be a word for it. 'cause it's how I feel all the time. My name's Akeelah Anderson and I'm 11 years old, and this all starts at Crenshaw Middle School in South Los Angeles. ♫ You're all in the seventh grade now, and I know you can do better than this. So when I give you a list of words, study them. Akeelah! How long did you study for this spelling test? I didn't. See me after class. Okay, you two need to turn around. Enough! You know, you could be one of my very best students. But you don't turn in half your homework. Sometimes you don't even show up for class. - What's going on? - I don't know. Have you heard of… Have you heard of next week's spelling bee? No. Well, I think you should sign up for it. Does he really think I'm gonna be walking around with somebody in little shorts like that? He crazy. Oh! Is Devon coming back today? Yeah, he got a 2-week leave. Your brother is fine. I got it all figured out, look. He's gonna be the pilot on a big commercial jet, and I'm gonna be the flight attendant. Hey! Spare some change for an old man, girls? I ain't got no change myself. Damn! Derrick-T's new ride is tight! He been trying to get Terrence in trouble. Girl, your brother can get his own self in trouble. - So what did Ms. Cross want? - Nothing. Just talking about some stupid ass spelling bee. You gonna do it? You probably be good. And get up in front of everybody? I'd probably pee in my pants. So, tell me about the boy in your class with the shorts. I think he is cute. ♫ Yes! Yes! Keelie, Mama says go eat. I'm about to get a high score. One minute. I don't care. Mama says go eat. Oh, yeah! I've been dreaming about your cooking for the past five months. Here, let me take that. At least I got one baby appreciate what I do around here. We all appreciate you. Hey! Give me some sugar. Where is Terrence? I don't know. Maybe he's still at practice. Practice was over an hour ago. I know one thing, he better not be hanging out with no Derrick-T. Derrick-T? That fool still alive? - Not after you get done with him. - That's right. Hey, you. So, how may planes have you shot down so far? So far, zero. But you don't do too much shooting sitting behind a computer screen in Nevada. Well, good. You stay on the ground. Let them white boys go up there. You stay down here where you belong. Mama, I'm gonna have my wings and my college degree before you know it. Unless, of course, this one beats me to it. Not skipping class with Georgia Cavanaugh she won't. - Skipping class? - Only P.E. You better not be skipping no class. Akeelah, go turn off the television. Hey, hey. Flip it over to ESPN real quick, let me check out the Lakers score, all right? I need you to talk to Terrence. …no more glue traps and no more throwing your money away. The scientific design… If you spell the next word correctly, you will be the champion. - What's this? - Akeelah, turn off the TV now. "Brunneous." B-R-U-N- N-E-O-U-S. Brunneous? Congratulations! You are the Scripps National Spelling Bee champion. Akeelah needs to listen! Turn it off now! Brunneous. Brunneous. "Brunneous. Dark brown, used chiefly scientifically." Well, why can't they just say brown? Daddy, have you ever heard of this word? Yeah. You probably did. "Cauterize." C-A-U-T-E-R-I-Z-E. "Fortification." F-O-R-T-I-F-I-C-A-T-I-O-N. "Correspond." C-O-R-R-E-S-P-O-N-D. Hey, freak. We want you to take care of our English homework. Everybody say you a brainiac. - I ain't no brainiac. - Like hell you ain't! Always got them A's down, right? - Yeah, she's scared. - Don't run away from us! I cannot thank you enough for coming down here today, Josh. I got the district breathing down my back. The test scores have gone down again this year. As I said earlier, I appreciate your dilemma, Bob, but… I really don't understand what it is I have to offer you. All I want you to do is look at these kids and tell me if you think my idea's crazy. I think some of them have a lot of potential. Girls! Why aren't you in class?! - She held us up. - Akeelah! Are you signed up for the spelling bee today? No. I want you to come to my office, please. So, Ms. Cross tells me you've never missed a word on your spelling tests, but your attendance record leaves a little to be desired. You're 11. Did you skip a grade? The second. Akeelah, have you ever heard of the Scripps National Spelling Bee? I think it was on TV last week. Yes! Yes, they show it on ESPN every year. Middle school students from all over the country compete in school, district, and regional spelling bees trying to make it to the National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C. Next year, I want one of our students there. So whoever wins the school bee today gets to represent Crenshaw at the district bee next month. Why would anybody want to represent a school that can't even put doors on the toilet stalls? Akeelah, if we can't show our students can perform, we're not gonna have money for books, let alone bathroom doors. Now, I want you to do the bee today, all right? So everybody can call me a freak and a brainiac? No. I ain't down for no spelling bee. Well, maybe you'd be "down" for spending the rest of the semester in detention for all your absences. I'd like to welcome you all to Crenshaw's first school-wide spelling bee. We have some very special students competing today. So let's give them all a round of applause. Whoo! Okay. We drew numbers to see who would go first, and that's Chuckie Johnson from the eighth grade. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, ♪ ♪ Chuckie, baby ♪ Mr. Welch, I have a question about the basketball nets. Chuckie! You need to pay attention. Now, we're gonna start things off with "grovel." Gravel? Like little rocks? No, "grovel." Like "get down on your knees and grovel." Get down on my knees? What? Just spell the word. Uh, G-R-A-V-E-L. No, Chuckie, you spelt "gravel." I meant "grovel." G-R-O-V-E-L. You weren't listening. Sorry, Chuckie. Who cares? Okay. Next up, Akeelah Anderson. Whoo! You go, girl! Akeelah, your word is "doubt." Doubt. D-O-U-B-T. I'm sorry, Akeelah, you have to speak up. D-O-U-B-T. Very good. Next, Calvin Baker. P-L-A-S-I-D. Placid. I'm sorry. It's P-L-A-C-I-D. Okay, Akeelah, if you get this word, you'll be the winner. "Fanciful." F-A-N-C-I-F-U-L. - Whoa! - That is correct, and you have won Crenshaw's inaugural spelling bee. Whoo! Whatever. Excuse me. Spell "prestidigitation." I'm sorry, sir, but this girl is only 11 and she has already won. Mr. Welch, what is this? "Prestidigitation." Can you spell it? P-R-E-S-T-I-D-I-G-I-T-A-T-I-O-N. - Whoa! - Prestidigitation. - That's correct. - Whoo! "Ambidextrous." A-M-B-I-D-E-X-T-R-O-U-S. "Pterodactyl." P-T-E-R-O-D-A-C-T-Y-L. "Pulchritude." P… P-U-L-C… R… I-T-U-D-E. - Pulchritude? - That's incorrect. It's from the Latin root pulcher, and there's an "h" after the "c". See? She ain't so smart! - Run, Forrest! See ya! - Bye, sweetie! Akeelah! Wait! Where are you going? You did great! You were spelling words I don't know how to spell. Mr. Welch, I told you I didn't wanna do this. They're laughing at me! They laugh because you intimidate them. But if you'd stood your ground, you might have earned their respect. Bob, the girl has potential, but… she needs to be coached. Do you know who that was? That was Dr. Joshua Larabee. He used to chair the English department at UCLA. He and I went to college together, but get this. When he was a kid, he went all the way to the National Spelling Bee, and he thinks you have a chance of going there yourself. I'm sorry, but I ain't doing no more spelling bees. Akeelah… Girl, you kicked some major booty on that stage today. But I couldn't spell "pulchritude." But you knocked out them other words right back at that dude. They were just trick words. Everybody know "pterodactyl" starts with a "p". Girl, if I could spell like you, I know I could be a flight attendant. Hmm. Keelie, hey. Wake up. Hey. Dev, are you leaving? Yeah. Got to get back to the base. Hey. Your principal called mama. Said you did real good in a spelling bee last week. I messed up a word. Yeah, well, he said you got a lot of them right. He also said you got an opportunity to go to an even bigger contest next week. - I don't want to do it. - Why not? Everybody's gonna be looking at me, and there's gonna be tons of words I don't know. So you're scared, huh? Come on. How do you think I felt the first time I had to jump out of an airplane? I mean, my whole body said, "Don't do it." Sometimes your brain gotta be smarter than your body, you know? But I don't like my school. Don't see why I gotta do anything for 'em. Then do it for Dad. I mean, you know how he was about words. He'd love to see you do something like this. What Mama say about it? You know how Mama is. She's got a million things to worry about. Tell you what. Just do this contest. And if you make it all the way to D.C., I will parachute down to see you. Would you like that? ♫ That is a wonderful decision, Akeelah. A wonderful decision. You think maybe the school could buy me a new outfit? You know, for the district bee? Uh… I don't know. Maybe. Uh, if you make it to the state regional, maybe something could be arranged. But you're gonna have to finish in the top 10 at the district level first. And, Akeelah, you're gonna be going up against kids from Santa Monica, Woodland Hills, Beverly Hills. Some of these kids have been doing this for years and never even made it to D.C. Well, maybe I should just give up now. No, no, no. No. I'm just saying you need to train hard… with Dr. Larabee. What? I don't need any help from him. I can do this on my own. Akeelah, the best spellers in the world have coaches. And I finally got him to consider taking some time during his sabbatical to work with you. Please, just talk with him. Here. - He doesn't live far from here. - He lives in this neighborhood? I thought you said he was important. And take this. It's a copy of last year's spelling bee. "Sacciform." May I have the definition, please? Resembling a pouch. May I have the language of origin, please? Latin. Latin? I thought this was supposed to be English. …F-O-R… "Scutellate." Can I have the definition? ♫ "Longicollis." "Jingoists." "Empennage." "Souchong." - "Intussusception." - Hey, what's that? Where you been? Mama's worried. Mama should just chill, all right? - What you looking at? - Spelling bee. Oh, yeah, I heard about that. You're going up against a bunch of rich, white kids. They're gonna tear your black ass up. "Intussusception" is I-N-T-U-S-S-U-S-C-E-P-T-I-O-N. You're late. You didn't answer the door. That's because you're late. Come in. Come. Come. Come. So… you wanna learn how to spell. I know how to spell. Spell "staphylococci." Um… - S-T-A-F… - There is no "F". It's derived from the Greek, so there can't be an "F". "Staphylococci." S-T-A-P-H- Y-L-O-C-O-C-C-I. Winning word, National Spelling Bee, 1987. The first thing most serious spellers do is learn all of the winning words and their origins. Well, maybe I ain't that serious. Maybe neither am I. So why are you home during the day? Ain't you got a job? Do me a favor. Leave the ghetto talk outside, all right? Ghetto talk? I don't talk ghetto. "Ain't you got no job?" You use that language to fit in with your friends. Here you will speak properly or you won't speak at all. - Understood? - Yeah. Whatever. You can leave now. - Excuse me? - I said you can leave. How come? Because I don't have time to waste on insolent little girls. Insolent? I ain't in… I mean, I'm not insolent. It's just the first thing you do is start doggin… criticizing the way I speak. I thought this was just about spelling words. Well, then fine. You know what? When I put my mind to it, I can memorize anything. And I don't need help from a dictatorial, truculent, supercilious gardener. I'm sorry to be so insolent. ♫ Hey. Baby, what are you still doing up? Gotta learn more words. You gonna come see me in the district bee this Saturday? What, is that at your school? Nah. Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills? Look, you got other homework. You need to focus on that. I don't want you spending all your time on this game. It ain't a game! Are you gonna come see me in it? You know I work at the hospital on Saturday. Maybe Kiana can go with you. As long as she don't bring that whiny baby. Come on, girls, let's go. We're gonna be late. Dang. I hope they ain't all here to spell. Okay, go get your number. We'll be sitting back here. Good luck, Keelie. Hi. Name? Um, Akeelah Anderson. Oh. Right here at the top. Hmm. I think you're the first speller we've ever had from Crenshaw Middle School. Um… how many kids are in this thing? 139. Next? Need some help? Don't worry. I won't impale you. This your first time? - Yeah. You? - Second year. I made it to Nationals last year. Finished 13th. Lucky 13! You went all the way to D.C.? Three of us made it from my school in Woodland Hills. See that kid right there? That's Dylan Chiu. He's come in second place at the nationals for two years in a row. This is his last year and everybody thinks he's gonna win. Frankly, I'd like to shove him off a steep precipice. Hey, my name's Javier. - I'm Akeelah. - Hope you make the top 10. I hope I'm not the first one out. Will all the spellers take their positions on the stage, please? Now remember, if you don't know how to spell a word, spell it the way it sounds. Kids mess up all the time when they think they're being thrown curveballs and they're not. Good luck. - Good luck to you, too. - Thank you. E-M- B-R-I- C-A… T-I-O-N. "Embrocation." "Rhesus." "Recess?" May I have a definition, please? A brownish-yellow monkey of India. Ah. "Rhesus." R-H-E-S-U-S. "Rhesus." That's correct. Number 54? "Eminent." Did you hear the word? I'm not sure if you're saying "imminent" or "eminent". Would you like a definition? That'd be cool. "Eminent. Rising above other things or places. High, lofty. Eminent." E-M-I- N-E-N-T. "Eminent"? That's correct. ♫ That's correct. "Hypertrophic." H-Y-P-E-R-T-R-O-P-H-I-C. "Hypertrophic." That's correct. That's correct. "Concierge." Is that like a guy who stands around in a hotel? Speak into the mic, please. And yes, it's a head porter or doorkeeper. C-O-N-C- - I-E-R-G-E. - That's correct. You're doing great. I'm gettin' lucky. I could be gettin' words like… "Polydactyly." We're down to 11 spellers. The top 10 qualify for the Southern California regional finals. In the next round… If you miss a word, do not leave the stage… …as you may have an opportunity to compete for any remaining places. Kiana! Get that baby out of here! So… Let's begin. …L-L-O G-I-Z-E. - "Syllogize"? - That's correct. "Synecdoche." ♫ Synecdo-key? "Synecdoche." You wanna tell me what that means? "A figure of speech, in which a part is used for a whole. An individual for a class, a material for a thing, or the reverse of any of these." We need you to spell the word. S… I… N- E- C- D-O- K-E-Y? "Synecdoche"? The correct spelling is S-Y-N-E-C-D-O-C-H-E. If you spell this correctly, you'll be our 10th and last finalist. "Carmagnole." Could I get a definition, please? "A lively song and street dance." Um… C- A- R- M-A… G-N-O-L-E. - "Carmagnole." - That's correct. And that means you are our 10th and last finalist for the district bee. They cheated! They cheated! I saw them! That boy's mama helped him out! But… Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Keelie's sister. I was standin' right back there, and I saw that boy's mama give him the letter "G". She was sayin' "geeeee." I… he knew the word! I… I mean, it's one we studied. - You… he knew it… - Ma'am. Did you help your child spell the word? Ma'am, this is serious business. Oh! You're damn right it's serious! You know, you are gonna give these kids ulcers! Do you know how long he has studied for this? - He knew that word! - No. I didn't. I'm sorry. Number 62, you are disqualified from competition. Which means, number 54, if you can spell one more word correctly, you'll be our 10th and last finalist. ♫ "Pastiche." P-A-S-T-I-C-H-E. "Pastiche." That's correct. That means you've qualified for the Southern California regional finals. Here's my number. We have a spelling club in my school. Maybe you should come practice with us sometime. - That sounds fun. - Yeah, it's cool. Hey, there's my folks. - I'll catch you later. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, check it out. Look at this. I'll be at USC this year. Just think, Akeelah. All you've got to do is place in the top three of the state regionals, you're going to Washington D.C. Not if I can't spell "synecdoche." Uh-oh, y'all. Look. As long as you live in my house, you will do what I say. - Mom… - And what I say? No drugs. No gang-bangers. And no $300 watches. Take it off. Derrick-T gave me this, mom. He did? Then I'm gonna give it right back… - Mom. - What? You two get inside. Take it off. - But, mama, I made it. - Made what? Made the cut. I'm going to the regional bee. Yeah. While you doin' that, I'm gonna be identifyin' your brother here in the morgue. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. Get inside, before I really embarrass your behind. Akeelah? Akeelah, get in here! It's okay, Mr. Welch. I'll see you later. What is the problem? Why do you have the police… - Mom… - …at 9:00 at night? Guess what? I'm goin' to the regional bee. Do you know how much I worry about you? Why do you insist on hangin' out… ♫ Dylan? Um… I'm Akeelah. Javier said I could come and join the study group today. All those rejects do that. My father coaches me privately. Who's your coach? I don't got one. How many spelling bees have you won? Just the one at my school. Spell "xanthosis." - Um… Z-A- - It starts with an "X". If that idiot hadn't been caught cheating, you wouldn't have made the cut. Euphoric. - Euphoric is an adjective. - Greek. It means, like, feeling great and everything. Either spell the word, or take a shot. If you miss either one, you get a strike. Three strikes, you're out. "Euphoric." E-U-P-H- O-R-I-C. "Euphoric." "Psoriasis." Are you takin' Latin at your school? - Psoriasis is a noun. - Greek. Are you kidding? My school barely has enough money for kick balls. There's no Latin classes. Latin really helps you understand words. Psoriasis is, like, itchy skin. Maybe your mom could drive you up here, so you could take it with us. I don't know. This is all startin' to sound real heavy. It is heavy. Spelling bees are serious shit. I think I'll take a shot. On second thought, could I spell the word? At Crenshaw, they think I'm a freak. Don't worry. They think we're freaks here, too. Hey, there's my mom. Need a ride? Oh… Nah. My mom's gonna pick me up. She should be here soon. Hey, I'm having a birthday party in a few weeks. You… you wanna come? Maybe. If I can. It was cool seeing you again, Akeelah. - Bye. - Bye. ♫ Where the hell have you been? Studyin'. Studyin' where? Woodland Hills. Woodland Hills? What you doin' there? They got a spelling club. Did Mr. Welch take you? 'Cause ain't nobody called me. I went by myself. I didn't think the bus ride would take so long. I'm sorry. Akeelah Anderson! You done lost your mind? You 11 years old! You don't be takin' a bus to Woodland Hills by yourself! - There's nobody around to take me. - That's 'cause I work. That's what you said on the weekend. All the other kids have their parents at the district bee. Well, maybe the other kids have parents who got more time on their hands. Look, I'm not havin' another child of mine disappearin' at all hours. So if this spellin' thing means sneaking off to the suburbs by yourself, - I'm callin' it all off. - We can't call it off! I'm goin' to the regional bee! Not if you flunk outta school, you're not. I just got a letter sayin' you gotta take summer school to make up for all these classes you done skipped. Mom, I hate Crenshaw! It is so boring there! And nobody cares! What, you think they care about you in Woodland Hills? At least they got Latin classes. And the kids don't have to study in their stairwell. Well, good for them. But until you finish summer school, at Crenshaw, ain't gonna be no more spellin' bees. But, Mama, I gotta get ready for the state bee during the summer. Well, you just gonna have to do that next year, aren't ya? - But that's not fair! - Not only is it fair, it's final. ♫ You'd let me do it. 1979. "Maculature." M-A-C-U-L-A-T-U-R-E. Origin is Latin. 1990. "Fibranne." F-I-B-R-A-N-N-E. French. 1996. "Vivisepulture." V-I-V-I-S-E-P-U-L-T-U-R-E. Latin. I learned all the winning words since 1925, just like you said I should. Sorry for bein' so insolent last time. That's not gonna happen no more… anymore. I promise. So I was wonderin' if you might reconsider coaching me for the state bee. 'Cause I need a coach. Bad. "Badly." You need a coach badly. Come in. Come in. Come in. That's a very pretty lady. She your wife? Listen, you got very lucky at the district bee. The competition at state level is much stronger, so if you and I were to prepare for that, we'd have to do it on my schedule. So we'd have to work three hours each morning, starting at 9:00. Can you handle that? Well, I do have summer school, but Mr. Welch say workin' with you could take the place of it. Isn't that for students who don't perform satisfactorily during the year? Well… sometimes with kids who want to get ahead for next year. Yes. Please, put that down. Just… Yeah. Have you, uh… Have you got any goals? - Hmm? - Goals. What would you like to be when you grow up? A doctor. A lawyer. A stand-up comic. I don't know. Only thing I'm good at is spelling. Go over there and read the quotation that's on the wall. Read it aloud, please. "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same." Does that mean anything to you? I don't know. It's written in plain English. What does it mean? That I'm not supposed to be afraid? Afraid of what? Afraid of… Me? This National Spelling Bee is a tough nut. I've seen it chew kids up and spit them out. So if you want to get there, you can't be a shrinking violet. You have to stand up and show them what you can do. All right? Then I'll brook no nonsense. You show up on time, with no attitude, or it's over. Agreed? Agreed. ♪ And maybe you should know ♪ ♪ That you ain't got no control… ♪ Stop, stop, stop, stop! Boy, Mom would trip if she knew we borrowed the car for this. That's why mama ain't gonna know. Come on, Georgia. Um… I'm gonna go to the mall with Kiana. But I thought you wanted to go to this party. Hey, Akeelah. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come on, let's go. - How are you? Thank you. - Okay. Why'd you invite him? My Dad's friends with his dad. I'm surprised he showed up. Hey, you want to see my house? - Yeah. - Let's go. This is my father's office. He's a journalist, and he's written, like, a bunch of books. What's your father do? My daddy? He used to work for the city parks. Man, you got a lot of friends. I never had a birthday party this big. I'd think you'd have lots of friends. Why'd you do that? I had an impulse. Are you gonna sue me for sexual harassment? That was nuts. What are they doin' down there? Oh, no. Dylan brought his Scrabble games. Scrabble? I get 30 seconds for each board. We need one more. Who wants to play? I will. ♫ And right out of the gate, Roman scores 32 points with "birch" on the double word score. Dylan counters with the immediate use of "Z" for 39 big ones. Polly tests the water with "acorn". And Dylan answers with a body-blow "beacon" for 20. Holy cannoli! Right off the bat, Akeelah uses all her letters, getting 50 extra points for a whopping 82. What will Dylan do? He's fighting the clock. You could cut the tension with a butter knife. Shut up! Shazam! Dylan gets his own bingo for 76 points. It's come down to this. After having crushed all five opponents, Dylan has only Akeelah to beat. But she's ahead by 21, and has only a few letters left. Is this an upset in the making? What kind of birthday party is this? Yowza! Using the triple-word score, Dylan charges ahead by six. Just go. Whoa… Yeah! Akeelah's in the lead by 12 points, and has only one letter left. But this could be Dylan's final play. Arrividerci, sweetheart. 12 points decides the game. But Dylan gets Akeelah's last two points. He wins. A heartbreaker. Wow, Akeelah. No one ever gets that close to beating Dylan. But I didn't beat him. Girl, you passed up the mall to play Scrabble? She just got lucky. If you can barely beat a little black girl at a silly board game, how do you expect to win the National Bee? Listen! We're not coming in second again this year. We're gonna win. Let's go. "He began to have a dim feeling that to attain his place in the world, he must be himself and not another." Dr. Larabee, this book is too heavy. Good. It'll develop your arm muscles. I thought we were developing my vocabulary. We are. Please continue reading. But I already know most of the words in this speech. It's not a speech, it's an essay by W.E.B. Dubois, the first black man to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University. Maybe we should be studying more big words. Spell "cabalistic." C-A-B-A-L-I-S-T-I-C. "Cabalistic." And when did you learn that one? About two minutes ago on this book. But in the time it took to learn that one word, Dylan probably learned 20. And those 20 words won't mean anything to him. He's just a little robot, memorizing lists of words. The people we're studying… Dubois, Dr. King, JFK… these people used words to change the world. And they didn't acquire their vocabulary by rote memorization. Okay. But when I'm at the bee, and they tell me to spell some little fish from Australia or some weird bacteria on the Moon, we're gonna wish we'd done a little bit more rote memorizing and not so much essay reading… if you don't mind me saying. Bacteria don't exist on the Moon. Let me ask you something. Where do you think big words come from? People with big brains? All right. What do you see? A bunch of big words I don't know. Ah. Look again. What kind of power do we get from the sun? - Solar. - So, what does "sol" mean? - Sun. - What does "terraneous" sound like? - Terrain. - Meaning the earth. "Soliterraneous" means… The sun and the earth working together. So where do big words come from? Little words. And how many little words do you know? - Tons. - Yes! And there are tons more for you to learn. There are Greek ones. There are Latin ones. French ones. And if you learn them all, you can spell any word, no matter how big. Maybe we should get back to the essay reading. What's the matter? I thought you wanted to win the National Spelling Bee. Maybe just getting there this time is good enough. Don't give me that. You want to win it so badly, it keeps you up at night. Ever since you found out there was such a thing as the National Spelling Bee, you've seen yourself holding up that trophy. But if you can't say it, you can't win it, so say it. - I wanna win. - Say it louder, please. - I wanna win. - You wanna win what? I wanna win the National Spelling Bee! Good. Good. You'll win using my methods, by first understanding the power of language, then by deconstructing it, breaking it down to its origins, to its roots. You'll consume it. You will own it. And then you know what you'll be? Mm-hmm. Tired. You'll be a champion. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. All right.

I told you, you pass summer school, then you can start worrying about spelling bee. - But if you would just… - Akeelah. Baby, I'm just not in the mood, all right? So how come you don't teach anymore? I told you, I do teach. I administer classes online. Let's keep going. "Effervescent." E-F-F… E-R-V-E… S-E-N-T. "Effervescent." Come on, come on. You know this word. That dog's distracting me! You're gonna have much bigger distractions when you get to the National Bee in D.C. Now, what is that you're doing with your hand, huh? What? With your hand, your hand. You… you… you tap, like that. - What is that? - I don't know. So, why do you got all these toys for? They belonged to my niece. Oh. So you got any kids of your own? You ask a lot of questions, don't you? I'm naturally inquisitive. Yes, which is also sometimes confused with being naturally obnoxious. Here. Let me see you jump rope. Just jump? Yes, just jump. Is there a point to this? ♫ Yes, there is. Keep going. I said keep going. Concentrate, stay focused. Spell "effervescent." Don't think about anything else. Come on. Go. E-F-F-E-R- - Good! - V-E-S-C-E-N-T. "Effervescent." You see that? That's your trick, that's your mnemonic device. Jumping rope? Keeping time, keeping time. You see, kids at the bee, they do all kinds of things. They sway back and forth, they turn around in circles, anything they have to do to stay focused. You keep time. And I bet you if you learned the words while you kept time, you would remember them even better. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♫ B-O-G-N-I-A… Correct. It's a game. It's too bad your mother had to work today, Akeelah. But did she get to see the new dress? Uh, yeah, she thought it was cool. Oh, there goes Javier. This is a very exciting day for us here because our top three spellers will be representing Southern California at the National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C. Yes! So what do you say? Let's spell! Well, Josh? You think she's got a shot at it? We'll see. "Alfresco." A-L-F-R-E-S-C-O. "Alfresco." That's correct. "Loquacious." "Espadrille." "Jambalaya." Would you repeat the word, please? "Malloseismic." M-A-L-O… S-E… I-S-M-I-C. "Malloseismic" is M-A-L-L-O-S-E-I-S-M-I-C. It's okay. D-O-U-B-L-U-R-E. That's correct. - "Psalmody." - Definition, please? - Psalmody means… - Mrs. Anderson! "…of singing in psalms." I want my daughter off this stage right now. P-S-A… I don't care what she is. I want her off that stage. I didn't know she was here, and I didn't give permission… - L-M-O… - Mrs. Anderson… No. I told here she was not to be here. And you don't take my child anywhere without my permission! Um… D-Y. "Psalmody." That's correct. Next, please. Excuse me, I'm sorry. The mother of one of the spellers needs to speak with her. It's rather urgent. Uh… Okay. But she must be back on the stage before her next turn or she'll be disqualified. She'll be back. I swear we thought you were on board with this, Mrs. Anderson. You want to tell me what the heck is going on here? Because I never signed a consent form. - I signed Daddy's name. - You did what?! How do you think I felt when Javier's mother calls me to see if I need a ride to USC?! I don't know who she is or what she's talking about. I'm sorry, Mama. I just wanted to do the bee. By lying? By going behind my back for the last six months? You might as well say good-bye to your little friends, Akeelah, because this is your last spelling bee. I beg you, Mrs. Anderson, to reconsider this. - She deserves this… - Bob. Mrs. Anderson's right. Akeelah does not deserve to go to the bee this year. What? Next speller, please. Come on up to the mic, please. A little faster. Come on. I apologize, Mrs. Anderson, if we've contributed to any anguish you may be feeling. And who are you, exactly? My name is Joshua Larabee, ma'am, and I've been… Well, I've been helping Akeelah prepare herself for the spelling bee. Akeelah's been getting extra school credit for working with Dr. Larabee. We designed an entire program specifically for her. Why didn't you tell me about this? Mama, I hated going behind your back. But every time I brought up the bee, you didn't want to hear it. I didn't know what to do. Can I get the pronunciation again? He's given it to you five times. You need to spell the word. Could you use it in a sentence? He's already used it in a sentence. I mean, a different sentence than he used before? You only get one sentence. What's up with this kid? Well, you must want this thing pretty bad, because you ain't never lied to me before in your life. So maybe you can tell me what you think a good punishment would be for what you did. I guess I gotta miss the bee. But that don't just punish you. Mr. Welch and Dr. Larabee done put a lot of time into this, too. So you think of something else. Maybe double chores for the month. For the next three months. She still got time to get back up on that stage? Uh, if we move very quickly, yes. Well, I guess you better get a move on, hmm? We haven't much time. Come on, come on. Thank you, Mama. All right. - Dr. Larabee, is it? - Yes. So you actually think Akeelah has a chance to win the National Spelling Bee? Yes. Yes, I think she does. Well… could you use it in a song? What? Never mind. "Ratatouille." R-A-T-A-T-O-U-I-L-L-E. "Ratatouille." Uh… That's correct. Where's number 73, please? She's here! She's here! - Thank you. - I was about to start tap dancing. Okay. "Pluviosity." Can I get a definition, please? Pluviosity means "a state characterized by much rain." Okay. ♫ "Pluviosity." P-L-U-V-I-O-S-I-T-Y. - "Pluviosity." - That's correct. ♪ R-e-s-p-e-c-t ♪ ♪ Find out what it means to me ♪ ♪ R-e-s-p-e-c-t ♪ ♪ Take care of T-C-B, hey! ♪ I'd like to thank you all for coming out today to honor our own Akeelah Anderson! Um… thanks… A lot. Akeelah, can I get your autograph? Oh, girl! You're like a movie star now! I know. It's pretty crazy. Hey, my mama says she wants to take us out to celebrate tonight. Javier's parents are taking me out. But you know, maybe we can… Akeelah? Excuse me. I'm sorry. There's a reporter here, and she wants to talk to you. - I don't want to talk to no reporter. - Are you kidding? This is exactly the kind of good publicity Crenshaw needs. Excuse us. Sorry. Hi. This is Lauren Sanchez reporting from South Los Angeles. I'm here with 11-year-old Akeelah Anderson. She's a seventh grader from Crenshaw Middle School who's heading to the National Spelling Bee. How does it feel now that you're going to be going to Washington D.C.? - It's pretty cool. - You excited? All right, well, let's check out the word that Akeelah spelled here at the Southern California finals that got her to the National Bee. "Erythrocite." E-R-Y… ♫ Spell "Affenpinscher." Affen what? "Grallatorial." G-R-A-L-A… Wrong. "Jacquard." - Dr. Larabee… - Spell the word. "Jacquard." - J-A-Q-U… - What about the "C"? These are all words that were missed in last year's National Spelling Bee, and you can't spell one of them. Maybe because we haven't studied them yet. Why did you cancel yesterday, hmm? Were you doing another interview, flaunting yourself in front of the television cameras? No, I was at the mall. Look, I wasn't dissing you. I was Christmas shopping. "Dissing"? I thought we didn't use words like that. I thought we only used words from the dictionary in here. "Dis, dissed, dissing. To treat with disrespect or contempt, to find fault with." New words get added to the dictionary every year. Look, I didn't get to the National Bee until I was 14 years old. I had no help, I had no training, I had nothing. By the time I got to the third round, I was out. You have an opportunity to win this thing. But all we've done for eight months is study words. Why can't we take a break? Go to a movie, to a basketball game? Why can't we have fun? I told you, Denise, you can have fun after the bee. Who… who's Denise? What? Denise. You called me Denise. Who's that? ♫ Dr. Larabee, are you okay? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Listen, I spent all last week making these for you. - What are they? - They're flash cards. 5,000 new words, the types that you will run into at the finals. 5,000? But we've only got a few months left. What, you gonna coach me 24/7? Uh, no. You're going to… um, learn these on your own. There's nothing left for me to teach you. What? You've got it all, Akeelah. You've got word construction down, etymology, memorization techniques. What you need to do now is just focus on the words. I can't learn 5,000 new words all by myself. Yes, you can. You've got a brain like a sponge. You just sit down and you study them. Dr. Larabee, I swear, I promise. I won't miss any more sessions, and I'll do whatever you say. You can't stop coaching me now. I told Mr. Welch I'd get you through the regionals and I've done that. Now, I don't have anything else I can teach you. You need to just take those words and study them and you'll be all right. This is why I was at the mall. Merry Christmas. ♫ Hello? Hey, girl. What you doing? Watching TV. You wanna go skating this weekend? Why don't you go with your friends from Woodland Hills? What? Girl, what's wrong with you? Nothing. I got homework to do. I'll see you later. Keelie! Keelie! Come on out here! Girl, you on TV. Hurry! Hurry! Come on, look! …has captivated her community. All of Los Angeles is talking about her. Well, if she wins the spelling bee, it's gonna be like everybody in the neighborhood wins. I think it'd be real positive. You know, good for the community. I might study for next year's bee. I wonder what's the matter with… Akeelah, what's wrong? I don't want to do the bee no more. You don't wanna do the bee? Why not? Dr. Larabee don't want to coach me no more. Georgia don't want to hang out with me. And all these people are expecting me to win. And it's just too hard, mama. I want it all to stop. - Baby, you were so… - Please. Please. All right. All right. I certainly didn't mean to upset her. I… Well, I honestly thought I was… doing the best thing for her. You know, Dr. Larabee, my child is only 11 years old, and she has been through so much already. Her father was killed when she was six. Somebody shot him on his way home from work. Do you have any idea what it's like for a girl to lose her father that way? I can imagine. Then why do you wanna cause this child any more grief? That's an unfair accusation. Mrs. Anderson, as I've told you, I'm… I'm just not in a place where I can… be of any more help to Akeelah right now. But she needs you. She does. I beg to differ, Mrs. Anderson. It's not me that Akeelah needs. I remember when he used to take us out to the ball games, take us to the movies. We'd have popcorn fights. I wanna tell you something. You know why I didn't want you to do the bee at first? 'Cause I saw that video of yours, and I saw one winner and 200 losers. And I didn't want you to be one of those losers. Did you know your mama… went to college right after high school? No. I had a scholarship. I was gonna be a doctor. What happened? I just felt so out of place at that school, I convinced myself that I was gonna fail. So before that could happen, I dropped out. I don't want you to do the same thing with this bee. "Gabbro. A group of dark, heavy rocks." Can you spell it for me? G-A-B-R-O. "Gabbro"? Actually, it's got two "Bs". You know, Akeelah, you ain't short on people who wanna help you. I'll bet you if you just look around, you've got 50,000 coaches… starting with me. - Mama… - Mm? Do you think that maybe you might go back to college? I just might. I love you. I love you, too. I love you, too. "Craquelure." C-R-A-Q-U-E-L… Hey, yo. So why are you punkin' out on this spelling bee, huh? What, you afraid of all the suburbia kids now? No. Hey! So how do you spell all these words anyway? I study 'em. Whatever. Well, there go my ride. - Hey, what up, Derrick-T? - What up, Terrence? Who that? That ain't nobody. Just my little sister. What up, little thing? Been seein' you on TV. Trying to win some big contest, huh? Answer the man. You know, I won something once. Fifth grade. Wrote a poem. Even got myself a blue ribbon, too. Yeah, that's good. - You wrote yourself a poem. - Shut up, dawg. What you think rap is? What's that in your hand? - Ain't nothin'. Just some stupid word. - Oh, you helping her? Naw, man. I'm chillin' with you, right? ♫ Nah, man. Stay here and help your sis. - Why? - 'Cause I say so. Let's break out, man. Derrick-T! - What's up? - I wanna read your poem. After you win the contest. Let's go, man. You ain't gotta help me if you don't wanna. En… franchisement? You mean "enfranchisement"? Hey, whatever. Can you spell it? 50,000 coaches. ♫ E-N-F-R… ♪ Wake up, everybody ♪ ♪ No more sleeping in bed ♪ ♪ No more backward thinking ♪ ♪ Time for thinking ahead ♪ ♪ The world has changed ♪ ♪ so very much ♪ ♪ From what it used to be ♪ - Aptery-go-tye. - What? - That right there. - "Apterygote."

I used to cry all the time. But then… I found something that helped. What was that? I spelled. Over and over again… and I'd feel better. Maybe when you're thinking of her… …you can try spelling. It might help. Akeelah. - Who told you? - You did. You called me by her name. Denise. That's her jump rope, isn't it? Yes. Was she your little girl? Yes. What happened to her? She got very sick. She was only a couple years younger than you when she passed. Where's her mama? She moved to another city, and, uh… After it happened, my wife… Patricia, and I found it… Slowly it became very difficult to be… Anyway, this is… this is Patricia's garden. You see, I need… I need a lot of order in my life. That's why I don't teach in the classrooms anymore. It's just too unpredictable. Like you. This whole spelling bee business now has become a little too unpredictable as well. Dr. Larabee… I… I can't go to D.C. without you. Yes, you can, Akeelah. You can do anything you want. I can't beat Dylan. - Don't say that. - It's true. It doesn't matter how many words I learn, he'll always know more. Let me tell you about Dylan. There's only one person who can push him to spell as well as he possibly can. It's not his Dad. It's not the spelling bee people. It's not even himself. That person is you. So, when you and I get to D.C… Let's make sure we give him a run for his money. Okay? ♫ Hey. Hi. I'm off to D.C. tomorrow. Yeah? Well, have fun. I'm sorry I've been so busy. It's just, this whole spelling thing's been real intense. But you know what? I'd give it all up if it meant you and me could hang again. - That's stupid. - Why is it stupid? 'Cause people want to see you do good. I want to see you do good. You know what? Georgia, you're my best friend, and you always tell me I can do things, even when I think I can't. But I gotta tell you something. If you want to be a flight attendant, you first gotta ride on a plane. I will, someday. How about tomorrow? ♫ Girl, I got… I got to talk to the captain! Ooh! Forget flight attendant. I'm gonna be the pilot. What's wrong with him? He has an aversion to heights. It's an aversion to plummeting. I may puke. My brother's in the Air Force, and he says that fear is all in your head. Here. He gave me this for good luck. Don't worry. I won't impale you. You know, I never really thanked you for helping me at the state bee. - No biggie. - Actually, it was very chivalrous. Wow. I'm not thinking about the plane at all now. Well, in that case… ♪ Dry all of your tears ♪ ♪ There's a smile, ♪ ♪ there's a smile ♪ ♪ Behind all of the rain ♪ ♪ There's sunshine ♪ ♪ for miles and miles ♪ ♪ Oh, everything, ♪ ♪ everything ♪ ♪ You mean everything ♪ ♪ You mean everything, ♪ ♪ everything to me ♪ ♪ Everything to me ♪ ♪ Everything to me ♪ - I told you not to shake it! - I'm sorry. Akeelah, I thought you guys were supposed to be studying? - We are. - Uh-uh. It sound like a party in here. Come on, now. You got a big day tomorrow. - Y'all better call it a night. - Half an hour more. 15 minutes. What do you think Dylan's doing now? Trying to learn ancient Greek. Maybe we should invite him over. That turd juggler? Forget it. I'll be back. - Yes? - Is Dylan here? He's busy. Well, me and some of the other kids are hanging out in my room, drinking soda pop and watching movies. We thought maybe he'd like to come over. I'm sorry, but tomorrow is the spelling bee. Well, you know, sometimes it's okay to take a little rest right before the big event, you know? Well, perhaps that is your strategy, but not ours. Wait, wait! This is for Dylan. Okay. "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be?" Check. Check, 1, 2. It's okay. There. I'm Ted Saunders here with Katie Kerwin McCrimmon, broadcasting live from the main ballroom of the Grand Hyatt Washington. Now, Katie, as a former spelling bee champ yourself, who do you think we should be looking for to do well in this year's competition? Several of the kids placed very high in last year's bee, especially Dylan Chiu. He's come in second two years in a row. Kick his butt, Akeelah. B-u-t-t, butt! But the speller I've really got my eye on is little Akeelah Anderson from Los Angeles. She's become a bit of a media sensation. Yeah! That's my sister! It's her first try at the spelling bee circuit. ♫ Could you repeat the word, please? "Ratiocinate." Ratiocinate. What in the hell kind of word is that? R-A- T-I-O- C-I-N-A-T-E. "Ratiocinate." That's correct. Yes. For an 11-year-old kid, that's just amazing! But watch out. One wrong letter, and that's it. "Oersted." What's the language of origin? It's from a Danish name. I can't stand this Korean kid. - He's Chinese. - He's uppity. O-E-R-S-T-E-D. That's correct. What's the definition? Xylem is a complex tissue in the vascular system of higher plants. Xylem. X-Y-L-E-M. "Xylem"? That's correct. They thought they had me, but I was too much for them. … T-H-O-E-P-Y. - "Orthoepy." - That's correct. "Flocculation" is originally Latin. Could you use it in a sentence, please? "Flocculation." - Can I have a definition, please? - That's correct. - Lobscouse. - The language of origin, please. Any alternate pronunciations? "Gastromithia." Can I get a definition, please? - Latin. - "Sclerotic." - "Madrigal." - That's correct. - Can I have the definition, please? - From earliest known time. - "Aboriginally?" - Correct. - Language of origin? - Yes! "Empleomania." …in any ratio without separation of two phases. M-I-S-C-I-B-L-E. "Miscible." Yeah! We're here in the eighth round of the National Spelling Bee, with only 30 spellers remaining. …U-R-S-U-S. "Excursus"? Oh! "Argillaceous." Excuse me? "Argillaceous." Can I have the definition, please? Argillaceous means of, relating to, or containing clay or clay minerals. May I have the language of origin, please? Latin. Man, that's a white word if I ever heard one! It's a trick! Stop playing! It's a suffix that would trip up most people. They would tend to spell it T-I-O-U-S or C-I-O-U-S. Is it derived from the Latin word argilla, meaning clay? That's correct. A-R-G- I-L-L- A… Come on. Can I start over? You may, but you cannot change the letters you've already spelled. A-R-G- I-L-L- A-C-E- O-U-S. "Argillaceous." That's correct. She got it! That's my little sister! ♫ Well, it's the 12th round, folks, and the five remaining spellers are Mary Calvaretti, age 12, 13-year-old Rajeev Supramonian, 12-year-old Javier Mendez, Dylan Chiu, also of Woodland Hills… Wow, they really crank 'em out down there, don't they? Of course, Akeelah Anderson. Could you use the word in a sentence, please? "The Merovingian kings were known for having long, red hair." Okay. Uh… M-A- R-O-V- I-N-G- I-A-N? "Merovingian"? Oh! "Merovingian" is spelled M-E-R-O-V-I-N-G-I-A-N. Forgot to spell it how it sounds. 13th last year, 5th this year. Next year, I'll take it all. Now it's your turn. …I-S-M. "Mithraditism." …P-I-S-C-E-N-C-E. - "Resipiscence." - That's correct. …F-I-R-E? "Vitrophyre"? Oh! Darn it! …I-N-O-U-S. "Serpiginous". - That's correct. - Yes! That's my baby. We're going to take a small break before Akeelah and Dylan commence with the championship level words. ♫ Pretty good, huh? You know what happened last year. Make sure you stay focused, right? This is your last National Spelling Bee. If you lose to that girl, you're second place your whole life! No way! You hear me? No way! Peeking on someone? Just wishing Dylan good luck. You've done a superb job. I'm so proud of you. Now, listen, they're going to hit you with every trick word they've got. Now, you just remember the things that we've studied. You can take these words apart even if you've never seen them, right? But if I don't beat Dylan, I've still got next year, right? Well, of course you do. Although I don't know how much time we'll have to train together. I've been asked to come back and teach at UCLA, and I've said yes. Really? Well, far be it from me to deny the next W.E.B. Dubois the benefits of my acerbic wit and sour disposition. What's the matter? Nothing, Dr. Larabee. I should get back. No matter what happens… I want you to know that I couldn't have gotten this far without you. Akeelah, baby, there you are. Come on. I gotta go. They're about to start up again. Don't look so nervous. I hear she had a pretty good coach. You know, I just found out that the bee only gives each kid two plane tickets. I was wondering how we ended up with six. Oh. Perhaps it was some unexpected largesse on the part of the bee. Or perhaps Akeelah's coach is also pretty generous. Thanks… for everything. You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Akeelah and Dylan back to the stage. Now remember, if either speller misses a word, the other has to spell that missed word plus another to win, right? That's right, and we could exhaust all 25 championship words, but it's never happened. The championship words are just too difficult. "Filiopietistic." Can I have the definition, please? "Of or relating to an often excessive veneration of ancestors or tradition." "Filiopietistic." F-I-L- I-O-P-I-E-T-I… Akeelah, you're up. "Xanthosis." "Xanthosis"? It starts with an "X." Miss Anderson. "Xanthosis." Z-A-N- T-H-O- S-I-S. "Xanthosis." Dylan, it's your turn. "Xanthosis." "Xanthosis." X-A-N- T-H- O-S… E-S. "Xanthosis." Xanthosis is spelled X-A-N-T-H-O-S-IS. Can I get some water, please? Can we please get both spellers some water? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - You just threw that word. - So did you. You're just gonna give this all away? Your dad will be happy. Who cares? He's never won anything in his life. I won the regionals three times in a row, and I finished second in the nationals twice. And now you can finish first. I can do it next year. You do your best this year. - Dylan. - You do your best… or I don't want it. Here's your water. That's kind of amazing, isn't it, that both of these incredible spellers - would stumble on that word? - I think we've got some pretty nervous kids up there. "Effleurage" or "effleurage." E-F-F- L-E-U- R-A-G-E. "Effleurage." That's correct. I tell you, this is just like watching two star tennis players at the net, returning volleys. I mean, these kids are incredible. "Lagniappe." L-A-G-N-I-A-P-P-E. - "Lagniappe." - "Summiteer." Could you use it in a sentence, please? - Is it a verb? - "Optimality." - "Tralaticious." - That's correct. - "Reciprocity." - "Parrhesia." - Is that Greek? - Is that Latin? - What's the language… - …of origin, please? - "Liophilize." - "Zarzuela." - "Vibrissae." - "Craquelure." That's correct. These kids are chewing through these super-tough words like they were breakfast cereal. You know, they could actually go the distance and most people consider that unthinkable. We're now 13 words into the championship level. If you make it through the remaining 12 words, you'll be co-champions. That's never happened before. - "Vinegarroon." - "Ecdysis." - "Concitato." - "Puerperal." That's correct. Dylan and Akeelah are trying to stage a miracle here.

That's what I'm talking about! You know that feeling where everything feels right, where you don't have to worry about tomorrow or yesterday, but you feel safe and know you're doing the best you can? There's a word for that feeling. It's called love. L-O-V-E.
