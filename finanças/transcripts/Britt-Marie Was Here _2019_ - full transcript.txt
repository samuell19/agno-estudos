How do you live a life? My sister Ingrid was quite a dreamer when we were kids, but I was always sensible. A presentable home says everything about you. I always say one should make a list. Then you do one thing at a time, and put everything in its place. Order and tidiness and a secure home where you know where everything is. I get up at 6 a.m. Clean, launder, shop, cook. Habits and routines give you peace of mind. Just like the cutlery drawer. Forks, knives, spoons. In that order. One of Kent's friends wanted to help after a dinner once and sorted them; knives, forks, spoons. Obviously, we're not friends anymore. Kent takes care of business, I take care of the house. This has worked perfectly for forty years. The best thing I know is making our home tidy and cook a nice dinner for when he comes home. Yes, I really enjoy my life. Here is the six o'clock news... A 60-year-old woman was found dead in her apartment after neighbors reported a foul smell. The police believe she may have been dead for several weeks... Hi, honey! About time... The food is getting cold. It was... I'm sorry. Do you like it? It tastes great! Why don't you say so then? Honey, I just did. It tastes great! Damn it! Soccer. Thanks for dinner. Kent loves soccer more than anything else. He says that soccer is a metaphor for life. How ten sweaty people on a muddy field can be a metaphor for life I don't understand! Goddammit! But we don't have to agree on everything. Yes! It's not that I judge him. I happen to believe that baking soda solves more of the world's problems than soccer. It certainly removes the worst stains imaginable. Everyone needs a place in life. Just like Kent and I have together. BRITT-MARIE WAS HERE Britt-Marie, where have you hidden my shaver? I didn't hide it. It's in the third drawer. Yes, how are you? No problem. Just a moment... I've got to go. I'll be late, don't wait up. Kent travels a lot with his job. He works very hard. I find traveling quite stressful. Excuse me. Excuse me! Hello, Britt-Marie Larsson. A heart attack? Can I help you? I'm Britt-Marie, Kent's wife. Oh? I thought... Well... Britt-Marie. Camilla. I guess you can find your way out. Well, then... I'll leave you to it for the moment. Well... I don't know what to say. Maybe it's best you don't say anything, then. Most people in relationships have to learn to deal with each other's weaknesses. If human weaknesses were heavy furniture it might be easier to clean around them. You know that dirt gathers under them but as long as your guests don't notice everything is fine... ...until the day someone moves that piece of furniture and everything is revealed. Then it's too late. One day at a time, Britt-Marie. One day at a time. So... Britt-Marie. What can I do for you? I want a job. Let me see here... You're 63 years old, correct? Correct. It's been 40 years since you had a job. Is that correct? Yes. My last job was waitressing. I'll be honest with you. There aren't many jobs for a woman of your age... ...or a man of your age, for that matter. On a positive note, there's no discrimination in that respect. But... Have you heard of Borg? Borg is the name of a place. No, I don't think so. Neither have I. They're looking for a youth worker. It's temporary, but it's a job. "Your work will include coaching the local youth soccer team." Any experience in soccer? Well... It feels like half my life has revolved around soccer. Sounds good. The job is yours if you want it. Thank you. Next station: Borg. Chaos. Or, "beyond all honor and decency", as my mother always said. One day at a time, Britt-Marie. One day at a time. - You can climb in and get it? - Why don't you do it? Good morning! There's something about children's faces. Everything is still possible. My sister had a face like that. Ingrid never ran out of dreams... ...one dream better than the other. But dreams are dreams and life is life. - Good morning! - Who are you? - Give us the ball. - I'd like an explanation. - What's going on here? - Seriously, who are you? Are you from the town council? My name is Britt-Marie. I'm your new youth worker. - Seriously? - Are you our new coach too? Yes. You're kidding! No, I'm not kidding, I can promise you that. Shit... Why aren't you in school? - What's so funny? - It's Saturday today. Give us the ball. If you clear away the broken glass you might get your ball. - Seriously? - Let's get this straight. When I say something, I mean it. Seriously! I'm going to the store now. If you've cleaned up when I get back you might get your ball back. Understood? - Understood?! - Yes! Good! It's not that I don't like children. I just don't think you can say you like all children just because they're children. Some of them are dreadful. I don't like all grown-ups either. Why should I? - This ball isn't ours, right? - It's mine. Not my ball. So... Anything else? Is there a glazier around here? Yes... Absolutely. I'm a glazier. I mean a professional glazier. You've come to the right place. I'm Memo. I do everything around here. I do post, pizza, glaziering, plumbing, electrics... You name it. What do you need help with? There's a broken window at the youth center. - Are you from the town council? - No, I'm the new youth worker. - You're joking. - I'm not joking. So you're going to coach the kids in soccer? Correct. OK... Sami! Meet the new youth worker. You're joking! No. Will you be coaching the team? Yes. Could you help me get in touch with the previous coach? Pops is dead. Your pops is dead? No, I don't have a dad. The previous youth worker... ...he died of a heart attack three months ago. They said they'd send someone, but not like... you. Well, as it happens, I'm here now. Can you help me with the window or not? Of course. Sami, we need a pane of glass. - Have a nice day! - Thank you. - Oh, I'm sorry! - Watch where you're going? Hi, Bank! I don't understand what people see in soccer. I have never in my life felt the urge to kick anything. Pass it! - Especially not a soccer ball. - Pass the ball! - Why didn't you pass it? - Where did you get that? Do you have another one? Sorry we didn't clean up. We don't have the time. We need to train for the Cup. What Cup? You don't know about the cup? No, I don't. The most important match of our lives and they send an old lady that knows nothing about soccer. Oh, well. Good, that's good. Yep! That's the best we can do for the moment. The window will be here in a week-ish. We had to order it from Karltuna, the big city. Have you worked a lot as a youth worker? No, not really. But you know lots about kids, then? - Yeah. - Good, me too! See the girl in yellow and the boy in blue... Vega and Omar, my brother and sister. I'm Sami. I applied for the youth worker job too but I guess I didn't have your CV or maybe they didn't want someone like me, you know... So... that'll be 200 SEK. 200? That's right. Can't you invoice the town council? I'm sorry, we only take cash. Thanks. Nice meeting you. Have a good weekend. Bye. Oh, my God! Hello! What are you doing? - Hello! - What? What's going on here? Do you know where the cones are? - The cones? - We need them for training. Look, I've cleaned this whole place! You come in here and act like a pack of badgers! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Now, I think we should start by behaving civilized and introduce ourselves. So... My name is Britt-Marie. Vega. Wilma. Max Svensson. Max Svensson. Omar... Svensson. They're brothers. Twins actually. I'm Toad and this is The Pirate. Toad and The Pirate. - What's your name? - Dino. OK, we've introduced ourselves. Can we start training now? I'd like you to know something. That window pane cost me 200 SEK. I think it's only fair that you should work to pay that off. It's called consequences. Do you understand? What do you want us to do? First, you'll clear up this mess and then you'll polish the windows. We don't have time for that. We need to train for the Cup. OK. I'll have to call your parents, then. Damn, it won't come off! Bloody paint! It won't come off. You should have thought of that before you scrawled all over that wall. They're more than just scrawls. That's graffiti. They're tags and these are scrawls. May I ask what the difference is? Scrawling is just sabotage. A tag shows you exist. Isn't there a better way of showing you exist? Why do you think the Cup is so important? Because you love soccer? No! We want to show them we're a team. Karltuna hasn't let in one goal over the past several seasons. We don't stand a chance but we can show them we're a team. Good Vega, never give up. If you mix baking soda, vinegar and lemon juice... Baking soda? Solves everything. I never dreamt big when I was a child. It was Ingrid who dreamt. I didn't mind standing in the shadow of Ingrid. Her dreams were so big they had room for me too. - Is there something wrong? - No. I'm Sven. Hi! I just wanted to welcome you to Borg. It's really fantastic that you're here... ...I mean, for the kids. I've got some jam for you, blueberry & raspberry. I made it myself. I took a course in town. - Yeah... - Yeah, well... Welcome! Sorry... I was thinking... You need somewhere to live. I mean, you can live wherever you want, but this might interest you. A very nice lady has a room for rent while she's waiting to get her house sold. I helped her advertise the room. It's not far from here. I can drive you... - ...if you like. - In the police car? Yeah. I don't think so. I can't be driven around like a criminal. No, thanks, but thanks for the tip! Yeah... OK. You really made it tidy here! Bye! And good luck, coach! Training... Yep! Training? With you? Yeah. You said you wanted to play the Cup? Do you know anything about soccer? Manchester United. You don't know a thing about soccer, do you? No. No, I certainly don't and it doesn't interest me either. I much prefer crosswords. Was that your pep talk? Pep talk? Encouraging words before a match. - Yeah. - Never mind. How about training? Yeah! What do you normally do? We usually start with "The Idiot" before we play. Yeah! Yeah! Let's play the... idiot, then. - What's so funny? - It's not a game. It's a warm-up exercise. Let's go! Yeah! - But I want to sit there! - Cut it out! - I prefer to drink from the can. - Use a glass. We sit when we're drinking soda. - Why? - Because we're not animals. So animals stand up and drink soda out of cans? I don't know. How old are you anyway? - You shouldn't ask. - Why not? Because it's age racism. It's just not polite. - Do you have any children? - No. - Why not? - A husband, then? - No. - Have you had a husband? Yes, I have. - What happened? - He found someone else. What's so funny? It's the same with all grown ups, right, Britt-Marie? Actually, I think It's time for soccer again. Listen up! Clear the table first. Oh, my God! Home-made jam? Well, that was nice of him. Maybe I should take that room... But me in a police car? Never! Good Lord! It's wonderful that you came here and took on those kids. It's not easy to replace Pops. So tragic, what happened to him. Right in the middle of the season. The children were devastated, but nothing is impossible. Maybe there's a chance they'll win the Cup after all. - Are you interested in soccer too? - Yeah. Someone once said: Soccer is instinctive. That's why you love it. If a ball comes rolling towards you you'll kick it. I've never felt like kicking a soccer ball. Britt-Marie, would you mind if I asked you out to dinner? What? There's a really nice restaurant... Well, I don't know about nice, it's cozy at least. I was thinking, if you didn't mind too much... ...I could pick you up. I could pick you up at 7:30 tomorrow evening. 6 o'clock. - What? - I always eat at 6. OK. Of course. 6 o'clock it is. - Hi, Bank! - Is she with you? Yeah. Bank is practically blind. The kitchen. Eat somewhere else. I don't want the house to smell. Stay away during the day. The realtor will be here with buyers. Maybe I should go first, since you're blind. I'm not blind. Well, practically blind? This is private. Don't go in there. Bathroom. Your room. Voila! 500 SEK per month... in advance. - Are you taking the room? - Yeah. Bank was a professional soccer player. - No wonder with a pop like that. - Enough, Sven. Anything else? No. There you go... Thanks. - Bye-bye. - Thanks... Thanks for the ride and for your help. No problem. See you. So Pops was really your pop? If you really must know, yes, he was my father. But he's not anymore. I just want to get this house sold so that I can get on with my life. Was there anything else? Ingrid always said she and I would live in Paris when we grew up. In a big house with servants. Celebrities lived in Paris and had servants, she said. You and me, Britt, she whispered, when we lay awake at night. I ended up in Borg instead. One day at a time, Britt-Marie. One day at a time. RULES OF SOCCER Let's go, then! Faster! We've got a goalie here. This works, right? Pass the ball! Pass the ball, Toad! Pass it to Vega! Pass it there! We haven't trained properly since Pops died. We're not very fit. I don't understand how you can do this to yourselves for soccer. Soccer means everything to me. I think about it when I wake and dream about it while I sleep... ...and a new soccer field of course. Do you dream of anything? Yeah... Sometimes I dream of traveling. Where to? I don't know. There must be somewhere you'd like to go. Paris maybe. Then soccer is to me what Paris is to you. Have you been there a lot? No, never. Why not? We were going to spend the summer in France. Finally, we would see Paris. Mom told Ingrid to put her seat belt on. They always argued about that. Ingrid wanted to feel free. That's how she was, full of life. Time to play some soccer! Off you go! One more round. No! Here we go! Come on, Max! It's fucking absurd! The goal is here. This is where you should be! Good! Toad, the goal! Defend the goal! Good! Kick-off... Play together! Play with each other, not against each other. Omar! Omar! Listen, everyone! Time for dinner. Time for dinner. We were finishing up anyway... Max, let's go! - Everything OK? - Yeah. Ann-Britt! I'd like to speak with you. Britt-Marie. Yeah... Sorry. I'd like to speak with you. I'm from the town council. Administrator for recreational activities. Have you coached soccer before? - No. - That was a part of the job description, right? Yeah... You know the youth center is closing, right? But they can still play soccer? Yes, but they need a proper coach. - You don't have a license, do you? - A license? A license to coach. - No. - No. How about closing this down now? But they're training for the Cup! Their lives are tough as it is. Haven't they lost enough? - Who says they're going to lose? - Who says water is wet? - You know they don't stand a chance. - No... No? I coach this team now and I intend to continue doing so. But... Go right ahead! But remember, no license, no match. Britt-Marie? Hi! I booked a table for 6 p.m. 6? For dinner. - But the laundry... - What's the temperature, - 140°F? - No, 104°F. How long does it take, 2 hours? 2 hours and 40 minutes... - ...including the pre-wash. - I see. If I promise to have you back in time for the dryer? What do you say? Damn it! I'm sorry... Thank you. My wife... I mean, my ex-wife didn't like me pulling out her chair for her. She liked it at first, but then she thought it was silly to pretend that we still cared for one another. We divorced two years ago. - Hungry? - No. Well, yes. A little... perhaps. Do you like the place? Please excuse me, I'll be right back. I just need to... - His name is Erik. - Who? The guy that my wife... ex-wife is with now, Erik. He's a mechanic. It was going on for some time. I tried to understand, but... I don't think it matters. Kent always says that I lack imagination. But that's not true. I have a very vivid imagination. - Of course. - You need a vivid imagination to pretend you don't know what's been going on for years. I've washed his shirts that smelled of perfume even though I never wore perfume. Cheers! - Cheers! - To imagination. Good evening everyone! We're Buffalo Beef! May I have this dance? Thanks for dinner. Thanks for the dance. Are you going to invite me in for a coffee? Coffee? - But we just had coffee! - Yeah. Do you want more coffee? No, I don't want more coffee. That's not why I asked. Thanks for a lovely evening. Thank you. I'd better tend to the laundry. - I'm sorry... - There's no need to apologize. Hi, honey! Hi... I asked about you at the pizza place. The guys there told me where to find you. - Do you know them? - No. Well, yes. I'm Kent. I'm Sven. I see... Well, I'll be off, then. Bye. Bye. You'd better come inside. It wasn't easy to find this place. I asked for directions several times and yet I took the wrong exit on the highway. I had to drive an extra 12 miles. The doctors say I haven't been well... for quite some time. They gave me a lot of antidepressants. A rather odd place to end up, don't you think? What was it your mother used to say about the countryside? "Beyond all grandeur"? No. "Beyond all honor and decency". Ah, yes... It's a little ironic that you should end up way out here. I mean... You barely left the house in 40 years! Maybe I didn't like traveling. No... I'm sorry! It's over, I promise you. She didn't mean anything to me. I need you at home, Britt-Marie. Everything's a mess when you're not there. We can't throw away a whole life together just because I... ...made a really stupid mistake. Kent, I've got a job to do here. We have a Cup match in a few weeks. Yes, I heard about that. You're a soccer coach now. - Yeah. - I understand. You've made that quite clear. Finish what you have to do here... ...and then you come home. OK? Love doesn't have to be fireworks and symphonies. For most people, love is other things. Habits, daily routines. Walls and cupboards and drawers where you know where everything is. Kent needs me. He's my husband and I'm his wife despite everything. - What are you doing? - This place is a mess. About the soccer... I don't know how long I'm going to be around. You're the one that knows something about soccer. Maybe you could take over. The kids, soccer and Borg FF mean a lot to you. That's enough! That team died with Pops. Leave my stuff alone and deal with your own problems instead! Hi there, coach! Hi, Britt-Marie! Put it on my tab. Welcome, Britney! How are you? - Would you like a kebab before I close? - No, - I don't like kebabs. - OK. A coffee, please. Strong coffee? Would you happen to have a little port? What do you mean? You know that's illegal. - That's not what I meant. - You know I can't serve alcohol without a license. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm joking! - I always wanted to play a gangster. - Christ! You need to practise those jokes. I agree. I haven't had the time because I've been busy. Not so much! In a coffee cup, so no one knows it's alcohol. Sami! Coach is here. Fetch the stuff that we got for her. Coach! We've got team jerseys for you. Why are you looking so scared? I think I'll just sit down for a bit, with my crossword. I understand 100%, coach. Nerves before a match. But know this, everything can be turned around. When you've grown up with Liverpool you know that everything can be turned around. Like the Champions League final. Sami, I've no idea what you're talking about. The Champions League final, 2005? Liverpool are down 3-0 at half-time. Everyone thinks they're finished. But then, in the 54th minute Gerrard flicks the ball into the net. Magic! 3-1, 3-2, 3-3. The match ended 3-3. But, we won on penalties. Everything can be turned around, Britt-Marie. It sounds so poetic when you talk about it. Soccer is poetry to me. I was born in '94... ...Sweden were going for gold in the World Cup. My year. I haven't played soccer since dad walked out and mom... Anyway... I look after the kids now. Soccer will have to wait. But I want you to know that what you're doing here means the world to Vega. Britt-Marie, are you drinking alcohol? Yeah. I'm a 63-year-old lady without a home. I'm stuck with a soccer championship, and a bunch of kids that have no faith in me. And I know nothing about soccer. So yes, I'm drinking a little alcohol and I think I'm worth it. OK, coach, you know best. Damn it! Here, Dino! Calm down! Max, Toad! Come on, everyone! SOCCER Pass it! Omar! Wasn't that offside? Are you stupid? What's going on? Vega! How's the coaching going, Britt-Marie? Like you said... ...it doesn't matter what I do. There's no point. We're useless. What the hell are they doing here? What are you doing here? If you're going to play the Cup... ...you need to try some resistance first. Omar, go get the vests. The rest of you, on the field! - Hi! - Hi! I didn't think you wanted to help us. Sami said they play like shit. I had to do something. You're not drunk, are you? Do you want help or not? - Yeah. - I thought so! Grown-ups versus kids! Sami and Vega are team captains. We play in two minutes! Do you play 3-2-1 or 2-2-2? I'm not sure. Sometimes two, maybe... Christ, you're worse than I thought! We need a forward that can score and three midfielders that can run back and forth... - ...and two good defenders. - Yeah! Borg! Wilma and The Pirate, defend the goal! Ready? Let's go! Yeah! The Pirate, back to your position! Defend the goal! Pass the ball to each other! You can't just run with it! Defend! Thanks everyone. Well done! Great job! Thanks for your help, Bank. It was really a big help. A proper coach must have an assistant coach, right? There's a puddle here... Britt-Marie, can we watch the game here? What game? Champions League... ...Liverpool are in the finals. OK, but shoes off everyone! I'll come with you, Vega. - Do you want to sit here? - No. No, don't do that! It's bad luck! Oh, I'm sorry! Leave! Go again! They scored when you left. If you stay out there they might score again! - It was a wonderful match today. - Yeah. I didn't want to bother you after your... ...your husband came around. I know that it must be difficult. I just want to say that I think you're wonderful, Britt-Marie. Listen to me! What do you mean? - We've been training really hard. - You knew this was coming. What's happening here? Did you know about this? Why didn't you tell them? I made myself very clear. Borg must have a proper coach trained and licensed. This didn't happen. You cannot play the match without a coach. That's it! But we've been training for ages! You should have been informed. We've trained really hard. We're so much better now. What's going on? Why didn't you tell us? We knew that the youth center was going to close, but... This center is closing down. There won't be a match tomorrow. All because of a bloody license? That's the way it is. Let's go, Max. So you're going home now. Home, to your husband. A Manchester United fan! You've been lying to us. Let's get out of here. Vega, I didn't mean to... - Do you two want a ride home? - Yeah, thanks. I... I'd rather walk. I need some air. OK. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? What about you? You should be working on tactics for the match. Oh, that's right, there is no match, because you did nothing. Oh, sweetheart... I don't know what to say. It's just... I didn't realize that you absolutely had to have one of those licenses. This isn't about a license. Who cares? This is about standing up for yourself. You can't say: "Oh, well!" and go home because a guy in a suit calls off a match. Did you say: "Oh, well!" when your husband met someone else? When you've lived your whole life - with someone... - You haven't lived your whole life. You've got half of it left, damn it! It's not easy to change what you're used to. My life has been the same for the past 40 or 50 or... Well... Actually, ever since... ...my sister died in a car accident when I was 10 years old. There was broken glass everywhere. I just wanted to clean it all up. I think I've cleaned my life away. My mom died last year. Car accident too. My dear child... Dad left when we were little. Sami looks after us now. I'm sorry to hear that, Vega. I'm sorry too... ...but I'm not giving up my dreams. Soccer is all I've got. I'm never giving up and neither should you. At least I'll show them Borg FF exists tomorrow. I just hoped that mom would see what I had done, that she would say: "How lovely you made it!" Dad worked longer and longer hours and mom stopped talking altogether. Mom, I made you some coffee. So I cleaned and hoped that someone would notice me... ...but that never happened. Then I met Kent. Because people are like dinners. We need a purpose. "This tastes great!" That's a purpose. One day at a time, Britt-Marie. One day at a time. Your husband? Yeah... He's picking me up later. I don't know what to do! I don't know where to go! OK... What's that? Is this yours? I knew I had it somewhere. We've got a Cup match to play. Sami is gathering the kids. I called him. Everything's ready. Put this on. Bank, I can't... I want you to wear this. Pops always wore it at matches. It brings luck, so I want you to have it. I'll be right with you. - Britt-Marie is here! - Coach! I was afraid you wouldn't come. Do you have our jerseys? - Yeah! - You're the best! Let's get changed. See you on the field. I don't understand what happened here. The team cannot play without a proper... - License?! - Yeah. Hi there! Do the kids have a coach or not? They do. - Britt-Marie Larsson. - Hi! This is Bank, assistant coach. OK. We'd better get started, then. Good idea! Give me two minutes with the team. Sure. I didn't think you would come. Here, put this on. Thanks. Things don't always go the way we think, Vega. I want you to... to know... Go out there and make a good impression! Was that your pep talk? Show them you're a team! Time for the match between Karltuna and Borg FF. Karltuna hasn't let in a single goal these past two seasons. This will be a tough match for Borg. We wish both teams luck. - Pass it, Vega! - Vega! Better defense! No! God, no! Defense! You need to fill the holes in the defense! Oh, no! No... No! Damn it! It's half-time. We'll take a 5-minute break. Karltuna leads by 9-0, but this match isn't over yet. Don't forget to get your raffle tickets. We don't stand a chance They're much better than us. They're not that good It's just that we suck! Liverpool! Remember how they turned a match around? Maybe you haven't noticed, but we're not exactly Liverpool. It's never too late. These last few days I wanted to give up too. But... ...if I could become a soccer coach then you can score a goal! It's not too late! Come on! Come on! On your feet! Show them that Borg will never give up! I know you can do it! Focus on the second half. You're a team. You can do it. Borg! Seriously?! Come on, Borg! Borg! Borg! Borg! They can do it! Don't give up, Borg! We're playing well. - Mark your opponents! - Good, good! Good job! Yes! Up! Up! Up! There! No! - No! - What the heck, ref?! OK, stay cool! You can do it, Vega! Come on. Take it now. Stay cool, stay cool... - Come on! - Last chance, Vega. You can do it. There goes the full-time whistle for an extraordinary match. Borg FF score a sensational goal at the last minute. Congratulations to both teams for a fantastic performance. Borg! Borg! Borg! Great! That was great, well it was... Good job. I'm impressed. Impressed enough to arrange a new soccer field for Borg and open the youth center again? I played for Borg when I was young and had soccer dreams. There just hasn't been anything to dream or hope for in this dump... ...in terms of soccer I mean, since Pops died. Nobody's investing in a place like this... and we all want the best for our kids. But it was wonderful to see how happy... But I... I'll see what I can do. 1, 2, 3. Borg! Yeah, this is good... Hi, honey! Hi! How did the match go? We lost by 14-1. Well, I'm not surprised. They didn't look very bright, those kids. Let's get going, then. Wait... Yes? All I ever wished for was... that you, just once, put your dirty shirt in the laundry basket. And that you didn't walk on clean floors with dirty shoes. That you cared, or just pretended that you cared. That you noticed what I had done one single time! That's all I ever wanted. I don't want that any longer, Kent. - You could have said something. - Yes, perhaps I could. But... Maybe I can learn to do that one day. So what do you want now, then? To stay here and coach a bunch of 10-year-old kids? I don't know. I don't know anything. I just know that I can't go home with you now. Honey, think this through. I'll check into a hotel in town for one night, but... ...tomorrow I'm going home. And if you're not there in the morning... I'm leaving. Do you hear me? I hear you. I hear you. Pizza time! Take a seat everyone. And free beer for you! And now for the winners of this year's awards! This year's goalie: Toad! This year's right backs: Wilma, Max. The Pirate! Omar! Dino! Vega! And now for this year's fighter. A person who has distinguished herself by her hard work with the team. A person who did what seemed impossible. A person that taught Borg to never give up. The world's best, our extraordinary coach... ...Britt-Marie! - Oops, sorry! That's yours. - No! It's yours. The last one's yours. I think there's more in the storage room. Britt-Marie... I know that you can't stay here in Borg. But I want you to know that every time someone knocks on my door I'll be hoping that it's you. How do you live a life? If you close your eyes hard and long enough you can recall almost everything that made you happy. The scent of a mother's skin. A father's cold nose against your cheek. A sister's hand in yours. All passion is childish, banal and naive. It's instinctive and overwhelms us a few moments in life. Maybe that's why we scream uncontrollably just because someone scores a goal. Maybe that's why one loves soccer. BRITT-MARIE WAS HERE Because it creates passion and dreams. - All together now... - This is perfect. Britt-Marie, our new soccer field! If you close your eyes long enough you can recall all the choices you've made just for your own sake... ...realize that perhaps it never happened... ...realize that all your dreams and choices might have been for someone else... ...but that it's never too late to start over.
