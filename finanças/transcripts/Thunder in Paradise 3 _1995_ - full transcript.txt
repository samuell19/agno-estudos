All right! Woman: I'm going in for a swim! Hi. Hey, bru. Penny for your thoughts. I just really wish I could do something like that, you know? Like what? Model like that. Ok, girls, give me that sexy look. That's it. Good. Beautiful. You know the only thing separating you from those girls? No. What? This sweatshirt. It's a lot more than that. Let me tell you something, Ali. You could blow them out of the water. Come on. Where? Over there. Bru! Come on, come on. It'll be fun. Let's go. Hey, hurricane, how you doin', man? Yo, Jimmy jam. Check it out, Spence. Whew! Photographer: Loving the camera, girls. Right here. Very nice. Hot day on the sand, huh? I'll say. Your buddies are blistering, and I don't mean their feet. I can see why. [Click] Go ahead. Take off your sweatshirt. I don't know, bru. Come on, come on, come on. Uh... Put your hair down. Go on. Yeah, you look terrific. What did I tell ya? You're gonna blow 'em out of the water. Come on. Ron rice? Hey. Martin brubaker. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Hello, Martin. Good to meet you. Call me bru. Everybody else does. I'd like to introduce you to Hawaiian tropic's next superstar model, Mr. Rice, Alison Wilson. Hi, Alison. Nice to meet you. Hi. It's nice to meet you. I think you're right. Can you turn around one time? She's incredible, bru. Steve, can you come over here a minute, please? Steve: Sure, Ron. Alison, this is Steve. Oh, no. Hi, Alison. How are you? Hi. It's nice to meet you. I think you should get some good hot shots of this lady. Good idea. She's a beautiful lady. Knock 'em dead. Thanks. Bye. What is he doing? Bru! Alison! Psst! Relax. Ok, thanks. Have fun. That's it. That's it, all right. Hey, legs. Just what is it you think you're doing? I'm catapulting Alison into the world of modeling. Throwing her to the wolves is more like it because that's all that populates the modeling profession. Legs, relax! We're just havin' some fun! Besides, you got nothin' to worry about when I'm around. I got something to worry about whenever you're around. She is not ready for this! She's not, huh? [Shutter clicking] Steve: That's it, Alison. Great. Sure. Take the robe. I need you at the sports shack, no buts. Legs, come on! She's not finished yet. She's finished now. If you could manage to pull yourself away from all this, we got a meeting with agent Harris. NSA Harris? Yep. That's today? This moment as you speak. No way to postpone it, huh? No. Spence, I think moments like this supersede any and all meetings. Let's go. Hey, come on! Come on, bru. April! You fellas really have the life. You don't know the half of it. You said over the phone you needed our help. We do. The NSA needs your help. A lot of innocent kids need your help. Now, the fight to keep cocaine out of this country has become a full scale war. This is Manuel Santiago. He's one of the wealthiest drug lords in the world. He's wanted in 17 countries for trafficking. Now, we put this guy out of business, we put an end to the largest drug cartel in the world. You guys usually handle these situations yourself... Quietly. Why would the NSA contact US? No extradition agreement with his country. Thumbs his nose at our government, turns around, does the same thing to his own. Why do they put up with him? Because they're just as corrupt as he is. Meaning they get a share of his profits. Yeah, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Hello. This is Mason Lee. He's Santiago's right-hand man. Came over from the red brigade. Now, it's been impossible to get through him to Santiago. But we put Santiago out of business, we can also put an end to Lee. Now, the problem is we can't go in and get Santiago, and my hands are tied. But you guys, you have the thunder scarab and stealth. You could go in undetected. So we slip in, we slip out, and hand Santiago over to you for payment. Not exactly. Look, this is a little awkward, all right? Now, I know your usual fee is 5,000 a day, plus expenses. I can pay your expenses. But you just can't quite manage to dig up that 5 thou, huh? I'm sorry, Harris. We, uh-- we'll take the job. Spence! We'll take the job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, both of you. I can't tell you how much we're counting on you. Now, here's all the information NSA's been able to gather. We'll leave late this evening. Oh, one other thing. If anything should go wrong down there, if you should get in any trouble at all... Don't call me. I can't help you. Now, the agency will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Good luck. All that and no pay. How do you manage to find US these wonderful clients? We got a chance to make things safer for kids like Jess. It's worth a free ride. Don't you think so? Don't mind me. I just like to gripe. With you 100%, brother. I am not happy with this tortilla casserole. It smells yummy, uncle bru. Mm-mm. Didn't have any celery salt. I think I added too much cilantro. Will you quit apologizing? It's fine. What you should apologize for is what you did to Alison today. Legs, honey, come on now. I don't know what I did, but whatever I did, I'm really sorry, ok? Come on! Come on. Ahem. Well, I want to hear about your new classes, young lady. It's the coolest school, dad. Kelly's gonna be my art teacher. She went there, and so did Alison before the convent school. Oh, really? I just wish it was more than two afternoons a week. I'm going to take ceramics and painting. I want to be just like Kelly. Nah. You want to be just like Jess. There's only one thing I can't figure out. What's that? I can't figure out if I'm excited or nervous. They both feel pretty much the same in my stomach. Well, I can see how you feel a little of both. Nervous because you're goin' to a new place, but really excited about all the fun things you're gonna do. How about you, Kelly? Are you excited or nervous? Well, since it's my first teaching job, I think I'm a little bit of both, too. My stomach definitely feels weird. But it could be bru's cooking. Oh! Dad, will you take me to school tomorrow? Honey, that's gonna be a little tough tomorrow. Uh, we have to leave tonight on a mission, honey. What kind of mission? Oh, just the usual catch the bad guys type stuff. Um, Kelly's gonna stay here with you till we get back. Jessica: Do you have to take it? Can't you stay? It's an important one, sweetie. But, honey, I promise I'll call you first thing in the morning. Promise? Do I ever break a promise, amigo? Ok, come on. Let's eat. I think I'll call for pizza. Hey, where are you goin'? Wait a minute! No pepperonis. What can I say? Still sleeping. What? Jessica-- she's still sleeping. I ever tell you the one about the guy who had a job givin' enemas to elephants? Get serious. Look, brother, goin' down to South America and doin' this gig for Harris I something only we're crazy enough to do. It's gonna take all our concentration. You got enough to worry about without worryin' about whether you're gonna keep that promise to Jess. I'm not worried, and I'll keep my promise. Ok? All right, bro. Circle detection clear. Stealth mode engaged. I think I got it, Spence. Up in the mountains next to a waterfall, heavy concentration of reinforced steel. Steel, huh? Yeah. If that's not a drug lord's bunker, I don't know what is. I'll take the stream. Watch out for crocodiles. [Chuckling] Mr. Santiago take good care of you, huh? Señor Santiago? Sí? Moment of your time, sir. Ok. [Speaking Spanish] Go on! Get out of here! [Laughing] [Groaning] Hey, Lee. How you like my new chiquita, huh? Huh? Not bad, sir. A shame what happened to the last one, huh? [Laughing] What do you have here? What is this, baños? [Clang clang] A new shipment, sir. Ah. [Laughing] Mason, I am counting on you to take care of this transaction for me. You can count on me, señor Santiago. Everything'll go smoothly, sir. Nothing can go wrong. This transaction is too important. No one will suspect that it's anything more than a shipment of sinks, sir. Arrives in L.A., dissolve down the fiberglass, leaves only pure cocaine. [Laughing] [Coughing] [Clang clang] I like it. Mason, come here. I'm very proud of you. Thank you, sir. Unh. Valdez! Sí, señor? Inform Miguel that the shipment is ready. He can have raoul and Alejandro when he needs them. Right away. Now, where's my little chiquita, huh? Miguel, this is valdez. Come in, hombre. The shipment is ready, and raoul and Alejandro are outside the bunker. Señor Santiago says to call for them when you are ready. Vamos. I'm on the street where they live, brother. Well, from what I hear, Santiago's at home. Yeah. He's got a few watchdogs. We better send 'em the dogcatcher, hadn't we? Tell you what. You get in and out as quick as you can, and I'll handle things on this end. Spence: Ain't no other way. Roger that. Ahem. Ahem. [Imitating] Miguel... Miguel, this is raoul. Raoul. Ahem. Raoul... Alejandro. Ok. Ahem. Raoul, Alejandro, this is Miguel. I need both of you this minute. There is no time to waste. Come now. Yes, sir. We'll be right there. Come on. Come on, you two. This way. Move it out. Come on. Señor Santiago. Sí? The shipment will be in L.A. in 4 days, sir. What? Mason, that's no good. I need it there in 2 days. I'll see what I can do, sir. We go play a little slap and tickle, huh? [Laughing] [Speaking Spanish] Let's go, guys. Move on. Put the boxes on the side. Oh. I like your little heart. [Beep] [Men coughing] Oh! Valdez! Yes, sir! Gather the men. Vamanos! Get that guy! And save him for me. [Gunfire] [Shouting] Come on. Come on now. Oh! Get up! Let's go! Aah! Aii! I can't walk without my cane! Use this. Get up. [Speaking Spanish] You better not hope that my men find you. They will mount your cabeza head on the wall! [Groaning] Get movin'. All right, this way! Come on! Look in those bushes over there. Ok, move. Come on, Jess. It's time to go. We don't want to be late for our first day. Can't we wait just a little longer? Ok. 10 minutes, but then we gotta go, call or no call. I know dad'll call. He promised. Let's move it, faster! Come on, will you? Hurry! Hurry! After them! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! We're getting closer! Move it, Santiago! In case you haven't noticed, gringo, I do not have a very good leg. I said move it. [Groaning] All right, this way! You will pay for this, my friend. You will pay for this! Somebody's got to. Harris sure isn't. Come on, let's go! Hurry, hurry! [Speaking Spanish] Get out! Yeah! Santiago! Yaah! Yeah! All right, watch it. Go, go, go, go. In there, in there. Go. [Laughing] Man: Ha ha! We got him, huh? [Laughing] Spence, come in. I'll be at our rendezvous in 5 minutes. Are we on schedule? On the money, brother. Ok, gang, school's in session. Lesson number one. [Screaming] Aah! Lesson number 2. It's coming back! [Laughing] I can't swim! Hey, man! Move it! Gringo, come on, huh? Come on. Hey, wait, please, gringo! Just keep movin'. Ok, all right. Check this way. Check to the right. Go over there. Man: Move it now. Come on, let's get him. Ok, it's all right. Come on, this way! Watch out! Think I found him. Move it, Santiago! I said move it! Aquí, muchachos! I said move it! [Shouting] Move it, Santiago! I said move it! [Dialing] [Line ringing] [Ring] [Ring] [Santiago's men shouting] [Ring] Dad? Dad, I knew you'd call. You know I'd never break my promise. Where are you? What's all that noise? I'm in South America, Jess. They're always celebrating something down here. You know, constant fireworks all the time. We're over here! Are you all fired up for school today? Oh, yes. I'm gonna make something just for you in art class. Dad, are you sure this is a good time for me to talk to you and everything? Never been a better time to talk to my girl. I want you to have a good day, ok? I will. I love you, dad. I love you, too, Jess. You're talkin' to your little niñita. Well, tell her to say some prayers for you, huh? I thought I told you to shut up. Jessica: Who was that talking to you, dad? That was just an insect. What kind? It was a leech. I gotta go now, ok, Jess? Spence! What in the hell are you doin'? It's Jessica. Hi, sweetie. Have a great day at school. Bye. Here. Thanks. Come on. Let's get to thunder. So it takes two of you gringo cowards to take care of one cripple. Shut up! Oh! Come on. We gotta hurry. Tough men, huh? Huh? Takes talent, huh? [Speaking Spanish] Oh, you're a big, tough man, huh? Yo, bro, what do you say we flood the dive chamber? Spence: Make it hot water. Ha ha. [Santiago continues shouting] You better get used to bein' locked up. In your face, my friend! Let me tell you something... Let's get out of here. Ugly sucker. Check it out, Spence. Thunder, give me stern camera on forward view screen. Uh-huh. Looks like those annoying party guests just won't leave US alone, brother. Well, then serve 'em some cocktails. I like it. [Gunfire] Are you sure that's environmentally safe? Absolutely. Totally dissipates... Once we serve up our chaser. [Laughing] Check it out, huh? Hasta luego, amigos. [Police radios] Watch that thing. That's the guy. Manuel Santiago? Sí, puerco. You're under arrest. Read him his rights and get him out of my sight! Doesn't it, puercito, huh? Hey, puerco, puerco! Hey...[speaking Spanish] Let me tell you something. I have friends, and they will not be happy with the way I was treated here today, huh? [Speaking Spanish] I will see you again, Spencer! I will see you again, huh? We got enough on Mr. Santiago to put him away in one of our finest country clubs. I hope it's a lifetime membership. [Speaking Spanish] Oh, believe me. He won't enjoy it. All right, let's roll. We're eternally grateful, my friend. Thank you. Kelly, please! It's a modeling job to die for. I get to go to The Bahamas for 6 whole weeks! It's out of the question, Alison. When you got permission from the mother superior to come here, it was under the condition that I look out for you, and that's exactly what I'm doing. I don't understand why it's such a big deal! You don't have to understand. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about. End of story. [Groaning] And after I beat the sucker, I flashed him again. Then brutus gave him the keys to his viper. I lined the car right over there in front of the scuttlebutt. I banged all 4 gears, went off the road, and the next thing I knew, I was staring dead on at a big, ol' brahma bull. That was you? Hey, hurricane, you guys, listen up. Dig this. "Manuel Santiago was convicted today "and sentenced to 5 life sentences "plus 20 years in prison for drug trafficking. "Santiago was apprehended a month ago by unknown agents." At least we got a mention. I hardly consider "unknown agents" a mention. Don't tell me you're in this for the glory, bru. No, it's all that money. Well, it's just too bad we didn't get Lee. Well, whatever. I think any time drugs and drug dealers are out of commission, it's cause for celebration. Hear, hear. Come on, Kelly. We'll be late for after-school class. Oh, you're right. Come on. Whoa, wait a minute. I'm almost done with my surprise for you. Well, you know I love surprises. Come on. Uh! If I don't see you in the future... Moo! I'll see you in the pasture. See you guys later. Have a great day, legs. Spence: See ya. Bru: Good luck. [Laughing] I'm so glad you could meet US. Oh, Kelly. It's so good to see you again. You, too. Oh, this is Jessica. Jessica, this is Savannah. She was my art teacher when I went here. How do you do? It's very nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you and all about your art work. I can't wait to see it. Let's go show her, ok? Yes. Great. It's like I told Kelly. You have to follow your dream, whatever it is. How do you find it? Aw, don't you worry. It'll find you. Isn't that right, Kelly? Yep. [Sigh] I can remember Kelly in this very courtyard, announcing to me and her classmates that her dream was to go to Italy and sculpt and never have to wear shoes. Well, some of it's come true. You don't have to wear shoes when you're at the beach. Unfortunately, the most important part of that dream hasn't come true. Never give up. There is no time limit on making a dream come true. Now I know why you were my favorite teacher. Even though Vanessa and I gave you a really hard time. I was so sorry to hear about Vanessa. I followed her modeling career when she went to New York. Her death must have been very painful for you. She was the sister I never had. I knew she was on drugs. There was just nothing I could do about it. Between the seduction of the fast Lane and the seduction of drugs, she didn't stand a chance. She was so young. Why, Jessica, that's wonderful. Did you sculpt that all by yourself? Kelly helped me. Oh. Just a little bit. How you guys doin' this afternoon? I thought this was Doug and Mike's route. This is our route now. Oh... And now this is our school. Ok, guys, listen up. Art, sculpting, painting... Isn't about technique. It's about emotion. Your job as an artist is to get your emotion from here... To here. Use your imagination. Don't see your sculpture take form. Feel it take life. [Fires] [Students screaming] Quiet! Shh! Jessica Spencer now. Jessica Spencer's not here today. She's sick. No, don't! [Screaming] No! Well, we found out how much you love your daddy. Let's see how much daddy loves you. Man: Let's move. Let's go! Inside! Come on. This way. Over here. Books in a gymnasium. Exercise the mind as well as the body. We had a fire... In the library. Pray you don't have one in here. These are children. You don't have to frighten them. Why don't you just let them go? Because I need them. You're a parasite, you know that? You live off of people's addictions, making money off their suffering and death. What do you know about suffering and death, lady? You ever been to war? I like a woman with spirit. Even a spirit that can get her killed. Don't hurt her, or my dad will-- I didn't know they were that close. Thanks. [Whispering] You. Come with me. [Telephone rings] [Ring] This is Spence. Last time we met, I didn't hear your voice. Who is this? Mason Lee. I'm with your daughter Jessica. Say hi to daddy. Daddy! Jess! Listen up, I've taken over your daughter's school. I get Santiago, you get your daughter back. As a bonus, you get the rest of the hostages. You hurt any of them, and I'll kill you with my bare hands. Deliver Santiago and nobody will be forced to kill anyone. Santiago's in a maximum security prison. Your problem not mine. You got 24 hours. This place is wired to blow. Be a shame if your daughter didn't make her next birthday. I may need more time. Nah. Sorry. No more time. Oh, and Spence... Kelly! [Children scream] Ok, ok. You've made your point. Quiet! Shh! Shh! Quiet. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Spence, you know how I feel about the authorities. It's not gonna be easy getting Santiago out of prison. You're clever enough to get him out of South America. I'm sure you'll think of something. Let me talk to my daughter. 24 hours. [Dial tone] [Groaning] Bru? Yeah. Can I interrupt you for a minute? Yeah. [Groans] What's up? She's being so unreasonable. Who? Kelly. She says I can't model, and that's that. She won't give me a reason, just, no modeling. What can I do for you? You could talk to her, bru. It was your idea. You could convince her. Please? Look, Ali, I'm sorry I stirred this up, but I'm in between a rock and a hard place here. Kelly's one of my best friends, and she's obviously really bugged about this whole modeling thing. It's just not fair, bru. You--it's just not fair. I know, sweetheart. Bru, they got Jess and Kelly. What are you talking about? Mason Lee. He's taken over St. Martin's. He wants Santiago released from prison in exchange for Jess, Kelly, and the other kids. Damn! They're not gonna release Santiago on a terrorist demand. We got to go in there and get them ourselves, brother. Let's go to thunder. Does anybody else know about this? So far just US. Let's do it. Spence, bru! I'm going with you guys. Not a chance. Look, I went to that school for 3 years, and I know a secret way in. Underwater through a drain pipe. Let's go. What's this building? Ali: The gym. Spence, I'm picking up high levels of benzene and phosphorous inside and outside the building, man. What's that mean? They planted explosives. Any way to disarm? I doubt it. Except at the source. The question is how many other gunmen he has with him. I'll bet crucial parts of my anatomy he's got up to a dozen. We'll leave thunder out of range. Then we'll swim the rest of the way underwater. Where's that drain pipe? Underneath the building where the grounds meet the water. It'll lead US straight to the basement. We used to sneak out of it at night to meet boys. Alison, I'm surprised. I was young. Remember what that was like? No. Being young? Valdez. Have one of the men check the building. Quince, go check everywhere that everything is secure. And bring me the report in 20 minutes. Vamanos. Yes, sir. Kelly. Kelly, you have got to be careful. And don't anger him. He doesn't care who he hurts. I'm not afraid of him. I know. He's the scum of the earth. The worst drug dealing kind. Kelly, are they gonna kill US? Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no. No one's gonna get killed around here. [Children scream] I said, no more talking! The basement's right above US. All clear. Alison, this is as far as you go. But I can still help you guys. No, no. No, honey, Spence is right. It's too dangerous. [Footsteps] Oh, my god. I left my spare air. Shh, shh. Where is it? Up there. All right, Alison, make your way back to the end of the tunnel. We're gonna meet you there. Honey, we couldn't have done this without you. Please get Kelly and Jessica and bring them home. We'll be home in time for dinner. Go on. Let's go. Quince should be back by now. I'm gonna go check for him. Ok. Point it up. Clear. Let's go. [Buzzer] [Voices] I found quince unconscious in the basement. What happened? It's not an accident. Get everybody in that room now! Let's go! Let's go. Dig in! [Beeping] Come on. Let's go! Light. Here we go. Stand up. What's your name? Say it! Shout it! Jessica Spencer. You, too. Kelly. Kelly larue. You shoot, they die! Lee, let them go. We can work this out. Daddy! Spence. Throw your weapons out. Ok. Don't do anything stupid. We're putting our weapons down. Lee... Come on, man. Let the girls go. We'll be your hostages. Come out where we can see you. I should kill you right now. Daddy! No! It's ok, Jess. He's not gonna hurt anybody. If he wants what he came here for. Where's Santiago? In prison where he should be. We'd be happy to help you join him there. I see you boys didn't take the hostage crisis class. You're supposed to be nice to me. If I don't get Santiago in 5 hours, I'll kill Kelly first. Save your daughter till the last. You're sick. My health's not the issue. Your daughter's is. Now you boys just upped the ante. We get the boat. You show Santiago how to operate it. Now get the hell out. Don't be afraid, Jess. He's not gonna hurt you or anybody. We're gonna get him what he wants. I'm sure you will. [Sirens] Police SWAT team surrounding the building. We'll hold them off as long as we can. Everyone, surround it. We move into position now. All right. Move in. Hey, move, move. You should've come to me right away instead of handling this thing on your own. Oh, yeah. What the hell would you have done? You know, brubaker, I've had you about up to here. The way I figure it, you owe US. Release Santiago. After the hostages are free, we'll get him back for you. Look, I wish I could, but that's impossible. That's your definition of eternally grateful? I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. Yeah. Ok, Harris. Fine. We're out of here. Come on, brother. No. Wait a minute. We're not out of here. Let's split. Thanks for everything, Harris. See ya. Ali, sweetheart, we got something we got to do. Wait here for US, ok? But what about the girls? We're gonna take care of everything. Just wait here. Ok. Hurry. Be careful. Please? Yeah. The electricity is fully restored. The explosives are wired. All right. Keep the authorities off my back, and I'll keep my word. Your daughter's counting on you, Spence. Don't worry, Lee. I've got Santiago. We'll dock the boat behind the school in 10 minutes. [Hangs up] Well, your daddy's on his way. This time he's bringing senor Santiago. Put your stinking hands into the air, you big, ugly gringo calabre. You're never gonna get away with this. You like my gun? It's a big one. Bru. We better get away with this, brother. Or else the girls are dead meat. [Police radio] I hope for your sake your daddy gets it right this time. You are so cruel. I'll tell you what's cruel, lady. It's what senor Santiago's government is doing to his people. That's why we're here. It's either you or US. I'm going to meet Santiago. When I give you the order, take the woman and the girl. Dump 'em. It's payback time for Spencer. This is Harris. What are you guys doing? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are those guys up to now? All right, everybody. Hold your fire. Stand by. Wait for my command. Ok, now we're gonna see what happens to you, gringo. Senor Santiago. Good to see you, sir. Not as good as it is to see you, my friend. Oh! [Laughs] Looks like you're gonna see your daughter after all, Spence. You got your man, Lee. Now I want all the hostages freed. When senor Santiago and I get into international waters, you'll get the hostages. By then, you'll have nothing to lose. Why should I trust you? Because you don't have a choice, Spence. [Laughs] Have they shown you how to operate the boat, sir? Si. Unless he has pulled a trick on me. Well, for his daughter's sake, he better not have. Come on. Move it. Ha! Move! Come on. Let's get the hell out of this place. Yes, sir. Yeah. Get me the warden at the federal prison now. This is special agent Harris. I mean now. Ow. Warden? Warden, special agent Harris. I've got a hostage situation here. I need the status of prisoner Manuel Santiago. [Whispering] Will that work? When I spray this hair spray, you just run for that door like crazy. Ok? Oh... Oh! Oh! Kelly, what's wrong? Please help her. She's in pain. Oh! Oh! Oh, my god. She needs a doctor. [Screams] Listen to me, Jess. Go to the basement and hide. I need to help cavanna and the other kids. Ok. Now, go. Go quickly. [Screams] What do you mean he's in his cell? Warden, are you sure? No. No, that's fine. Thank you very much. Oh, look at that, huh? [Muttering] This boat's got all the bells and whistles, huh? Yes, sir. Huh. What you have done will not go unnoticed, my friend. Thank you, sir. What? What are you doing? That should be better, sir. Let's see. Yeah. That's much better. [Laughs] This is one hell of a boat, huh? [Continues laughing] Go on. [Speaking Spanish] What are you doing? I'm scanning the police band, sir. We'll know their every move. Turn that damn thing off. I do not want to be reminded of these stinking police. They treat me like a dog in their prisons. But, sir, i-- no buts about it. Turn it off. Now! Harris: I'm ordering my men to move in now. I told you to turn that damn thing off! I just got a report from the warden that Santiago is still in his cell in prison. Thunder, initiate auto pilot. This is for disgracing senor Santiago. Valdez. Come in, valdez. This is valdez. Valdez. It's a trick. Blow up the school. Yes, sir. Kids! Kids! Jess, Kelly! Cavanna: We're in here. In the locker room. Is everybody ok? Kids: Yeah! All right. Stand back. Everybody ok? All: Yeah. Where's Kelly and Jess? I don't know. Lee separated US. Get the children outside fast. Ok. Go this way. Go this way. Come on. Do what they say. Go. Put your gun where I can see it and come out with your hands up. Let's go! Let's go! Put them where I can see them. Turn around! Turn around! Down on the ground now. Come on. [Struggling] [Struggling] You know I can't drive this thing. I need your help. We can do it the easy way, or we can do it my way. Let me tell you something about your precious Santiago. Thousands of kids die in my country every year because of what your boss does. The only disgrace is having to look like him! I ain't showing you nothing! I guess it's my way. Come on! Come on, come on, move, move! Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Spence. Thank god. Where's Jess? Hiding in the basement. Is everything ok? I hope so. Let's go. Spence! Spence, this is bru. Come in. Bru, are you ok? No. No, man. Valdez is setting the explosives to detonate. You gotta get everybody out of there right away. I'll warn Harris. All right. I'll be right back. Auto pilot, disengage. Let me out of here! Jess! Jess. She's got to be in here. Spence! Jess! Help! Kelly, I'm in here! Can you hear me, Jess? Kelly, I'm in here! I can't hold on. Can you hear me? Jessica! Jess, can you hear me? Kelly, I'm here! I'm up here! Jessica, can you hear me? Help! Kelly, I'm up in the ceiling. She's in one of these air ducts, and I don't know exactly where. [Screams] Jess, it's your dad. Where are you? Dad, I'm in here. She's here. Jess? Help, Kelly! [Screams] Spence: Jess, turn your head away. I'll get you out. Jess: Help! Daddy! Daddy! Dad! Honey... oh, thank god you're all right. Oh, god. Honey. Take her. Jess. We've got to get out of here. Lee's got this place ready to blow at any second. Let's go. All right, down, down, everybody, down! Hi. Hi. Oh, cavanna. I'm so glad you came down. Oh, I wouldn't miss my, um... Barefoot friend for anything. Oh, Kelly. Kelly, you stood up to Lee. I always knew you had courage. Sometimes a little too much. I'm just glad all those kids made it out ok, you know? Yeah. Kelly, I... I watched you teach. You have a gift for inspiring students that many art teachers can only dream of having. Oh, hi. That's a dream come true, too. People you care about. People who care about and love you. The closest many people ever come to that is... In dreaming. Cavanna... Kelly. Kelly. Hi. Oh, hi. Sorry. Thank you so much for helping me get ready for my shoot today. You picked the perfect bathing suit. Everybody loves it. He loves it, I love it. Well, you know what, I really got to get back to work. I just wanted to thank you. Thank you so much. I gotta go. Bye. Good luck. As a very smart lady once told me... You gotta follow your dreams. I can't stop her because of what happened to Vanessa. She deserves a chance. Kelly... I couldn't be more proud of you. Here's to a very successful mission. And our girls are home safe and sound. I'll drink to that. Me, too. Me three. Hoo-yah! It's just too bad about what happened to our school. Jess, you know how I've always told you that in every big, black cloud there's a silver lining? Well, st Martin's needed a lot of renovations. But they never had enough money to rebuild the school. But now... Thanks to Mr. Lee, the insurance company's gonna pay for it. And Santiago and Lee finally got what they wanted and deserve. Togetherness. Forever! Behind bars, huh? [Everyone laughs] Wow, looks like he got you pretty good, brother. Well, he had a few good moves. But at the end of the day, I beat him like a rented mule, huh? Thank you. Now there's no Santiago. Hey, bru. That's my girl. Hey, wait a minute.
