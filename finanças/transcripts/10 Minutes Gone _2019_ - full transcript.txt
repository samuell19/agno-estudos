I'll take care of things from here. - Thanks, babe. - Mm-hmm. - Thanks. - Sure. So I thought through every angle and reverse-engineered each option. If our primary is compromised, I set up two backside positions leading down the alley, where we jammed those surveillance cameras. I'm gonna have two getaway cars positioned at the north end of the alley, just off of Fifth Street, and one on the first floor of the parking garage. We all good? Can I get you guys anything else? Let's settle up. Your money's no good here. Thanks. - We good? - Yeah. - Take care, all right? - Take care. See you guys. Looks good, fellas. You sure about this girl? She took me in when no one else would. Trust me. She's been working this game in this place, and she's got ties all over the city. She's our ace in the hole. - [scoffs] - Like you always said. All right. No fucking around. Let's go over this again. ♪♪ [clock ticking] FRANK: Three-card monte is a confidence game, a street hustle, in which the object of the game is to find the money card. The psychology of the con is to increase the mark's confidence until he believes that he has a special ability to cheat the dealer and win easy money. The people involved in it are known as "shills." They conspire with the mark to cheat the dealer when, in fact, they're simply conspiring with the dealer to cheat the mark. [ticking] It's almost time. How are we looking? We sacked all surveillance cameras within a six-block radius. We'll have at least a 30-minute window where all of this is clear. As long as the Sullivan brothers don't fuck up their end, we'll be ready to roll out as soon as they come in? Well, that doesn't give me much confidence. Heard one of your boys had an image problem. More like hard-core rotten luck. Could've happened to anyone. Yeah, but it happened to one of your guys. His brother's a rising star. He's pulled some major scores. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. As we discussed. Five hundred for the hardware and the five-man crew. The other one mill will be delivered upon receipt of the case. Looks about right. All of these are clean. You can dump 'em anywhere once you finish your next job. None of 'em can be traced back. Care to inspect them? Do I need to? None of us would be here today if we didn't believe in honor amongst thieves, right? All right, so who are they? REX: Griffin is the best hacker I've ever seen. All he needs is inside access to the system. I guarantee you it's gonna be disabled. Marshall and Baxter are toughest guys on the circ. They will not hesitate to throw down if they get backed into a corner. Frank and Joe Sullivan. Frank's the best lock man outside of New York. He's never taken a pinch, unlike his brother. I was reluctant to allow a jinx like Joe onto one of my crews, but Frank stepped in and vouched for him. Then you don't mind personally guaranteeing delivery. [chuckles] Yeah, if everything goes according to plan, they'll be hitting the bank right about now. Right on time. At least we got a break in the rain. - Let's go, baby. - Let's do it. [chuckles] How can I help you? I'd appreciate it if you'd get your ass on the ground. [cocks gun] - [gasps] - [screams] Move, move. Don't shoot, don't shoot. Police! Drop the gun. Drop the gun! Drop it! Get on the ground. On the ground! Ladies and gentlemen, on the ground. I thought I told you to get your ass on the ground. Thirty seconds, a new personal best. You, sir, need a new security system. You got the keys? Vault keys! There's not much left in there. We've been flooded out. - On the ground! - Okay, okay. Come on, let's go! Get out of there! Come on out! Let's go! You make sure your face is on the ground. If I see your eyes, I will put a bullet in your head. Move! Move! Come on, move it! Get down! You too! The alarm goes off, I shoot you. I don't get what I want, I shoot you. That's me. The keys? Face on the ground! FRANK: How we looking? You guys are up. GRIFFIN: Face on the ground! BAXTER: Everyone flat on the ground, phones out. Three minutes, Frankie. [beep] [crash] Goddamn it! [beep] Stop breaking my concentration. Figured while we're here. Bingo. Ah, we're home free, brother. - All right. - Oh, yeah. We're ahead of schedule, so let's... [alarm blaring] Shit. Let's head for the primary. Go, go! JOE: Keep your faces down. FRANK: Marshall, Baxter! Where the fuck are they? [gunshots] Freeze! [alarm blaring] JOE: Shit! We gotta go! Secondary. Go, go, go, go! Who's been hit? Head shot, head shot. I need backup on Courtside. They have body armor. We got a runner! Get the chopper! What the hell is going on? What's happening out here? - Get back! - I have family they're holding! They need your help getting out! - Get back! Get back! - We need help inside! I said get back! Officer down! Officer down! Take 'em, Marshall! Let's go! Freeze, you son of a bitch! Let's go, Marsh! Two suspects. We gotta get to the Fifth Street exit. How the fuck did the cops get here so fast? I had it timed out. Could've been a guard we missed, a secondary alarm. Bullshit. I had this planned out perfectly. No sense in worrying about that now. At the end of the day, whoever gets the package gets paid. Know what? Fuck this. Let's clear the area and go straight to Claire's. That wasn't part of the plan. I'm not trusting anything we had set up with Rex. Let's get to Claire and get the fuck out of the city. [gunshots] [labored breathing] [distant siren wailing] [ringing in ears] Shit! Joe. Oh, shit, Joe! Oh, fuck, Joey. [siren approaching] Fuck. [groans] [engine starts] [coughs] [vibrating] - Can we do this in person? - REX: Where are you? What the hell happened? This was a cakewalk. - In and out in 10. - Maybe... Maybe we lost track of a guard. Bad call, letting Joe run point. The guy's a jinx. You should've let me buy him out! It could've been a solid payday, instead of this fucking mess right here. Security detail changed. Some civvie was playing Dirty Harry... - Where is the rest of the crew? - I don't know. Got my bell rung. You don't know. That crap ain't gonna cut it. He's your brother! This is the kinda shit that put him away the last time. Joe's dead. I'm sorry, Frank. You know, this is still business. What's the rest of the damage? I don't know who's still in play. What is it? It went straight by the numbers. The alarm went off, and we cleared the vault. Where's the package? Joe had it. Then all hell broke loose. I got hit in the head and got knocked out. How did you get out? We took the secondary getaway on Fifth Street. It doesn't answer my question. Where's the case? I don't know, Rex. Probably whoever hit us has it. They knew exactly where we were gonna be, then they left me there to take the fall. It won't take long to ID Joe. Where are you? Clearing out of my safe house. What? Get to the holdup on Crenshaw. You were supposed to do that anyway. Look, if someone's setting me up, then Crenshaw's probably already compromised. Get your head on straight. Call me the second you hear anything about the case. You understand that? [sighs] I got a guy on vice, said the bank's a fucking mess. They shot the place up pretty bad, took out a bunch of damn cops in the process. None of this connects back to me. I'm on it. Cops aren't holding anyone, but Joe Sullivan's on his way to the morgue. - Where's his brother? - I just got off with Frank. It's a rough break, but he's a pro. Does he have the case? He couldn't tell me a goddamn thing. This isn't what I signed up for. You've already made the deal for the hardware. Which was contingent on the acquisition of that case. Now, without that, all of this is worthless. I've never had a job go down like this. It wasn't the crew or me. It was the caper that went sideways. Who else was after this thing? Besides us? Every law enforcement agency in the country. Whiskey, neat. Mm. You drinking to forget? Drinking to my brother. I'm looking for his girlfriend Claire. She's not here. If she is here, she's in danger. Upstairs. Thanks. I don't have much cash. Take it and get the fuck out. Frank? Joe's dead. What? That can't be right. Shit. Supposed to be a really easy job. What the hell happened? Somebody shot him. What do we do? I can give you this cash. For what? Joey asked me to look out for you in case shit went wrong. What happened in there? I don't know. I don't know. I got knocked out. But you got away. I woke up next to a Dumpster, where we parked the secondary getaway vehicle. But those ten minutes... gone. What were you after? Money? Some sort of metal case. I don't even know what was inside it. How can you not know what's inside? It was just a job, all right? It paid well, but it was just a job. It's a bust anyway. What difference does it make? It matters to me. That ten minutes took away the life we had. Look, he asked me to get you out. I can give you some money, but we have to go. Who else was there? You met them. There were five of us on the inside. One of 'em planned the outs. The outs? Escape routes, new identities, that sort of stuff. Maybe one of them. Can't you just... - We're wasting time. - What the hell are you doing? We have to move. Don't you understand? It's not safe for you here. The cops are gonna be after whoever's close to Joe. Now put this on. Is that who I think it is? Why would Rex send his cleaner here? Oh, fuck. Where's the back door to this place? Through there. We gotta go. Now. My window to get to Crenshaw has closed. Rex must think I ambushed the deal. You got someplace else to go outside of town? I've got a brother that lives up in Minnesota. Good. If anybody asks, you've been there all week. Now get in. - [engine starts] - Oh, shit, she's back! Get down, get down! All right. I didn't think it would be so tight. My out's blown. We should get outta here. Tell me we have eyes on Baxter and Marshall. Still can't reach anyone, and Frank hasn't been to Crenshaw. Nothing? From this vantage point, it looks like the cops have locked down about six city blocks, including the secondary fallback. Every cop in the country's after this thing, right? Right. How do we know they didn't tag the score? Because if they did, then I doubt we'd be standing here right now. CLAIRE: What is this place? Joey designed secondary escape routes for both of us. His plan was foolproof. If someone hijacked it, it was one of us. So why are we here? Baxter was one of the guys covering the lobby this afternoon. You think it was him? He's smarter than he looks. And he always kept dirt on everyone. If this guy killed Joe, aren't you taking an awful risk going in alone? I can handle Baxter. You stay put. - Let me come with you. - Not a chance. The only reason I got roped into this is because Joe needed a score to prove that he could still deliver. Now lock the doors. Like it's gonna help in this neighborhood. - [gun cocks] - Psst! Jesus, man! That sidearm for me? Just staying safe, man. How'd I know you weren't gonna bring the five-oh? Anyone else here? No, it's just me, brother. Hey, I know you weren't tight, but respects for Joe. It's all over the news. We in some gnarly shit, Hoss. What the hell happened back there? - We got a rat in the crew? - Hey, we cool, man. I covered my post. It was all clear till things went postal. What happened there in the vault, huh? Joey and I were ahead of the clock. You were the one with eyes on Marshall. You tell me exactly what you saw. Sitting on the guards, when the fireworks started, you know how he rolls. Charlie Bronson had to check it out. - And Griffin? - Trolling the security station. - Then what? - I got the hell outta Dodge when the alarms chimed. Been here ever since. Griffin was supposed to kill the alarms. Yeah, man, but something tripped. After all these years, I dodged every bullet. I wasn't gonna wait for no cops. They were waiting for us right out front. Shit! We got heat! [alarm blaring] Baxter, it's a setup! Bring 'em up! Damn! Let's go! Keep your faces down! [gunfire] We dumped the car in the river, and Marsh and I went separate ways. I had my eye out on the ball. You think Griff or Marsh made a play? I won't know that till I find 'em. Any idea where they're at? Can't help you there, dude. Why you camping here instead of Crenshaw? This is my hood. If we did get punked, the big kahuna might send out Ivory, and I don't wanna be a part of any of that shit. [phone chimes] That's probably Rex's boys trying to squeeze me to come in. Shit. - Who is it? - [lighter clicking] Is it Rex? Sorry, dude. CLAIRE: Frank! - [screaming] - Shut the fuck up, man! - Shoot him, Frank! - Shut up. Drop it or I drop her. - Hey, Baxter. - Huh? - You like dancing? - What? Hope not. Oh, my God! - Shit. - Damn it! Frank, hurry! I thought I told you to stay in the car. - I heard shots! - And what were you gonna do? - My leg! - Shut up! Help him up. Get up now. - Help him up. - Okay, okay. [grunting] Let's go, come on. This was planned to perfection. It's all there. Everything. I gave you the best crew money can buy. It's just a simple fucking bank job, if you know what you're doing. Not just one bank. One branch, one location, one vault. So why did we break into it? Twelve years ago, there was this world-famous jewel thief that stole what was equivalent today to 30 million in raw gemstones. Now, his fence was told to stash it in one of those safety deposit boxes, pending the sale of the merch. When the fence was killed for shopping around the jewels... the thief fled to a non-extradition country. Why now? The Mann Chandler Bank was flooded a few weeks ago when the Ohio River overflowed. Now, their customers were told to come in and collect their property, or their safety deposit boxes would be moved to a different location. Now, I was hired to bring in the best crew to retrieve that, since he couldn't step foot onto U.S. soil. Who else knows about this? Look, I hired you because I was told you didn't ask those questions. Your job was to tell the fucking truth! Look, I can't wait any longer. Now, I know you and Frank are tight and all, but that case buys a lot of loyalty. But even more favors. He never gave me a reason to doubt before. Everyone's got their price, even Frank Sullivan. And everyone's an asset, until they're not. [groans] Take it easy! Give me the real or the next one's in your gut. I didn't do it, man. We got history, I swear. Then why did you try to kill me? The alarm wasn't my fault, man, okay? Griff got antsy. When the shooting started, I followed Marshall out the door. M-Maybe we missed a teller or a civvie had a phone. It just happened so fast. Marshall was pinned down, gunning away. I got a few shots off. I thought if he can make it out, so can all of us. Bullshit. - [click] - God! Where's Griffin? I don't know, I don't know. [click] God! I swear it's all I know. Did he hijack us? No, man. One out of four. That's all you got left. When the alarm went off, I got the hell out. You know I'm no good to you dead. CLAIRE: I don't believe him. What's with her? You don't remember Claire? Claire, you remember Baxter, don't you? Of course I do. Hardest part about working in a bar is figuring out who's drunk and who's just stupid. Tell us where they are, or I'll blow another hole in you. It's too late, bro. They're probably in the wind already. [click] Fuck! Where's Marshall? The guy's no sucker. If you want to find him, he's probably where he's always at. How about Griffin? I'd be surprised if he's still in the state. [Claire shouting] [click] That was close. Let's go. CLAIRE: What the hell is going on, Frank? Someone's playing me. You heard what he said. Yeah, and I don't buy it. If Marshall killed Joe, he could shoot you too, right? [sighs] I don't know. It's all a blur. I don't know what happened when I was out, but when I came to, Joey was already... He was what? He was gone. Did he say anything? No. But he did ask me to get you out if something happened to him. He really looked up to you. CLAIRE: What the hell is this place? FRANK: They call it the Raw Deal. High stakes, no rules. They pay the police to turn a blind eye. If Marshall's still here, this is where he'll be. You wouldn't have another one of those for me, would you? Yeah. You take the driver's seat. If he is still here, we might need to leave in a hurry, so be ready to rock and roll. Got it. DOORMAN: Hey, Frankie, how's it going? How's it going, bro? You all right? Marshall upstairs? - Up there playing. - Cool. [soft chatter] Need any drinks here? Thanks. Thanks, baby. Hey, I'll take care of you later, okay? 20 more to you, sir. - 20. - 20? I'm all in. Come on. - I call. - What have you got? All the way down the hole here. Beginner's luck. Pair of jacks. - Kings and jacks. - Read 'em and weep. Ah, sorry about that. Beginner's luck. Hold up. What do you got? Three 10s. Winner. What, are you two guys working together? Hey, don't be a sore loser, all right? Come on. What's wrong with all of you? All you fishes done for the day? Who's next? I'm bulletproof, baby! Hello, Marshall. Frank. That was some fucked-up shit today. [chuckles] Goddamn right. And here you are playing cards like you got a pretty sweet hand. - Ah! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy. Easy. Easy. Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down. I got your attention now? Why you fucking with my sunny disposition, Frank? [chuckles] Everybody, calm the fuck down! Jesus! Would you guys relax? Relax, okay? Put the guns down. Just talking here. See, these are my boys, Frank. These are my boys. And they've always been my out, and if you ask any single one of them, they'll tell you the exact same thing. That I've been here all day, that I won some, I lost some, but I'm still ahead of the game. I'm still ahead of the game. What's your alibi? I been busy hunting down you sons of bitches. Now where's that goddamn case? Hey, I held up my end. No, that's not how Baxter tells it. [laughs] Baxter? Baxter waited till the end to show his rat-ass face, and I got the scars to prove it. You left your post. I had those guards wrapped tight. Swept the lobby two times. Two times, Frank. And you and Joe are running long, and before I know it, two cops are in my eyeline. - [gunshot] - [alarm blaring] And I went out first because those two fucking pussies couldn't hold their own. Who tripped the alarm? The guard? Someone from the bank? I didn't miss no motherfucking guards. What kinda Mickey Mouse job did you and your brother cook up? Joe's dead. Oh. Well, then Griffin's laughing his way to Mexico right now. - Griffin? - Yeah, Griffin. That cocksucker showed up when the shitstorm went down. Now I figured he was just sick of waiting too. But as soon as the alarm went off, he busted ass right after you and Joe. - [alarm blaring] - Keep your heads down! [alarm continues] And now I take this thing, with no payoff, and Griffin's playing us like a bunch of chumps, and you're in here trying to take care of me? You couldn't take care of a two-dollar whore, you or your dead fucking brother! Keep talking shit about my brother. I'll blow a hole in that nasty little fuckin' mouth of yours. Me and my boys had plans after this, Frank. And now... we are going to have to take it out on you. Go! Go, go, go! [tires squealing] Get up! Get 'em! Come on! Oh, my God! What happened back there? [gunfire continues] Are you okay? They're fuckin' dead! Come on! Fuck! Get up. Come on, grab the cash. Let's get outta here. Come on, come on! Hello, boys. Haven't heard from you, Marshall. Must've got lost on your way to the Crenshaw. Yeah, we were just heading there. Little late for that now, don't you think? Fuck! Doesn't have to go down this way, Ivory. That depends on you. - Anything yet? - Nothing. [phone vibrating] IVORY: I've got eyes on Marshall. Where was he? Holed up down at the Raw Deal. Thought he was covering his tracks with five-oh. Hey, that's not what was going on. We were just playing it cool. Did you hear that? Yeah, let's just keep this simple. Go ahead. IVORY: He's all ears. MARSHALL: Look, man... I don't care what you have to say. Who's got the case? Baxter and Joe are dead. Me and Frank don't have the case. That means Griffin did a snatch and grab. You sure about that? Yeah, I busted my ass to get out of there. Cops were out front, the alarm went off, shit was fucking haywire, all right? Nothing went according to plan. All the pieces were in position. That's all I know. Then I guess your markers are getting called in. Marker called. Do you have any tracking on Frank? I had eyes on him earlier. He's got someone with him, a girl. Sanitize the site, so you can lead this to the case. I'm on it. Cops still don't know anything. They're scrambling all over the city. Anyone else think this isn't a big coincidence? Joe comes to town. Now half the crew's dead, and Frank's MIA? [phone vibrates] - Is that Ivory? - Doesn't say. Let's play it back on this. ROBOTIC VOICE: Follow these directions carefully. Case is secure. Same deal as before. $500,000. 10 p.m. - Place, TBD. - [beeps] Things are getting out of hand. It's time to wipe the board clean. Liquidate everyone. CLAIRE: Joe and I came up here all the time. You can see the whole city from here. It's a different kinda jungle. This city hasn't worked out like I planned, but... I don't quit easy. You don't seem like the guy your brother told me about. Reputations have a way of opening and closing doors. I was done way before ever taking this one on. You really didn't know what you were stealing? It's better that way. Cleaner. Joe said we'd be set. Must be pretty big for all this heat. He was betting it all. He never listened to a word I ever said. He couldn't have gotten on this if you hadn't vouched for him. That's because he spent seven years in the joint for a job he did in Phoenix. No one would touch him after that. He just wanted to be his own man. And he was desperate. He needed this. Thing I don't understand is... I've done over a dozen of these jobs with Rex. Nothing like this has ever happened before. It must've been Griffin on the double-cross. It's a pretty good way to avoid splitting the take. Griff doesn't take chances. He'd be on his way out of town by now. And there's only one guy who knows how to get him a new ID. [engine starts] WOMAN: Yeah, is that what it is, huh? 'Cause these tits were good enough for you last night when I threw you $50. Hey, I paid for the room in full! - Not the whole night, darling. - Oh, yeah? Was it? - Time's up. Get outta here. - You got a problem with that? Time's up! Get outta here! Cocksucker. Hold it with that, tough guy. - Hi. - Rooms are 69 a night or 20 bucks an hour. I appreciate that, but I really need to find my brother. He's supposed to be staying here. You see, he's gotten himself into a bit of trouble and... Love to help you, darling, but lots of people come and go. I think what the lady's trying to say is he'd be here to see the doc. The doc. [sighs] Did he have an appointment? [scoffs] He doesn't make appointments. And you already knew that. He don't take credit cards either. Well, fortunately for us, I brought cash. All right. Rate is $500 for an operating room. Doc's been a bit busy today. I need you to stay in room 307 till his assistant comes and get you. - You got cameras in every room? - Wait a minute. Now, that would violate our clients' privacy, right? CLAIRE: Oh, my God! What the hell? I don't walk into a room unless I know how I'm getting out. Room 309 and 311. Let's go. - Step back. - What if they start shooting? Hey, Griff, that you? What do you think you're doing? You can't come in like this. Take it easy with that, man. I don't even know you. Hold this. What do you want me to do with this? - Watch the door. - Okay. Busy day for you, huh? For you or for me? It's pretty quiet. Kinda dead, actually. [chuckles] Friend of mine took a slug earlier. Maybe you worked on him? A lot of people come in here. I just do my job. I don't ask questions. Griffin O'Brien. Tall guy, kinda handsome? Yeah. Yeah, he said it was ricochet. Where is he? You know I can't tell you that. Yeah? Eyes on him. - Hands up. - Just be cool. He said if I disturbed him, he'd shoot me. Then you better pray that he's not feeling trigger-happy. Now open that goddamn door. [keys jingling] Mr. O'Brien? It's Dr. White. I'd like to check your bandage. FRANK: Open it. Goddamn it. Gone with the wind. - Where? - He got winged pretty bad. It took me two hours to patch him up. No, no, no! I don't give a shit what condition he was in. There's only a half a dozen of you assholes in this city, but you were the only one who could provide a new out. CLAIRE: Frank! Hold on! [gunshots] Come on. - Jesus. - What did you do? CLAIRE: He went for a gun. I had to shoot him. I'm sorry. He had nothing to do with you people. All right, enough games. Where'd he go? Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. Is that right? We'll just see about that. Sit down. Sit down! Put the mask on him. Turn it on. That's it. Now, nice deep breath, Doc. [coughs] You know why I'm here. Two inches thick! There you go. That's it. Now... I'm gonna ask again, and you're gonna answer 'cause, as we both know, if we don't stop pumping this with oxygen, you're gonna hallucinate like a son of a bitch before you die. Now, where is he? - Where is he? - [Doc groans] - Where? Where? - Hold still. I sent him to Montreal! Montreal? Bullshit! [screams] Where is he? What's that? Shit. You see that woman? You know who she is? You better start talking, or I guarantee you she's gonna turn you inside out before she kills you. Montreal. Fuck it. Put it back on. No! [groaning] Montreal! What? The train to Montreal stops in Toronto. After that, he's on his own. CLAIRE: The train for Montreal stops in Toronto. Come on. We gotta get outta here. Good luck, Doc. Let's go. This way. There's a fire escape through here. Come on. We gotta get as far away from this place as we can. Come on. [heartbeats] No, wait. [phone vibrates] Talk to me. Looks like our boy Frank might've been right. The doc did a patch job on Griffin and sent him packing. Where? Train to Montreal, boards 10:00. What? No matter what happens, Griffin doesn't make that train. Fuck him! Hey, you need to go send someone to intercept. He's left the underground. No way Frank's gonna catch him anytime. We are totally off plan here. I'm not comfortable with any of this. There's always a degree of risk when the stakes are high. This is making me insane. Go to the bar downstairs and have a few drinks. Tequila. Try tequila. It'll calm you right down. That's what you need. [phone vibrating] HANNAH: You are all over the news, Richard. This isn't what you promised us. Look, we've got bigger problems than that. You know that if the FBI figures out what we were after, every one of us will be on their most-wanted list. Look, our middle man is starting to ask too many damn questions. Tell him what he wants to hear, just as long as he completes the job. I think someone from his crew is angling trying to get a payday on this thing. Then what do we need him for? Clock is ticking. Make the deal with whoever has it. Right. And you'll live to steal another day. MAN ON P.A.: Your Cincinnati rep reminds you that all premises are nonsmoking areas. The Cincinnati Police Department reminds you to keep your luggage with you. I thought I told you to stay in the car. Like you can search this whole station by yourself. Not that you'd listen. Who knew so many people still took the train? CLAIRE: Didn't he say his destination's for Toronto? It's a stopover on his way to Montreal. These are all end of the line. The next one leaves in an hour. Platform four. Over there. Cardinal line now arriving on track three. See these folks? Employees get to ride for free. No more paper trail. If Griffin wanted to blend in, all he'd have to do is get one of those uniforms. Oh, shit. What if he's already on the train? No. It's way too early. He'd jump on at the last minute. I got an idea. - I'm sorry... - Excuse me! CLAIRE: It's important. Excuse me, I really need your help. My son just got away from me, and I don't know where he went. I lost my son. I can't find him. His name is Griffin. He's eight years old. Calm down and tell me where you saw him last. He's wearing jeans and a blue jacket. He was over there. Okay. ATTENDANT: May I have your attention, please? We're looking for an eight-year-old boy wearing jeans and a blue jacket. His name is Griffin, and his mother is waiting for him at the information desk. Thank you. I got you, you son of a bitch. Oh, there he is. I see him. Thank you so much. Thank you. Ladies' room. Move. Don't say a word. Let's keep it simple this time. Ivory, you got the wrong idea. Really? 'Cause I saw what you did to Baxter. You made quite a mess, and I had to torch the place, and now Rex is in a real jam because of you. I got cracked in the skull. Do you know how crazy that shit sounds, Frank? Straight up, you thought you'd get away with it? [phone vibrating] ROBOTIC VOICE: Meet at platform seven. Union Station. If you're not there with the 500,000 in 30 minutes, the case leaves with me. [beep] I can't believe you're considering this. What other option do you think we have? Have you ever considered that we could be getting set up? That could be the feds for all we know. I doubt the feds are really that smart. [phone vibrating] IVORY: Got your boy Frank Sullivan standing in front of me. We're at the station. You're on speaker. You didn't report in. Now you're taking down your own guys? One of us is bad, and it ain't me. I'm just trying to get even for Joe, get back what we set out for. No, you're passing the buck when you screw up. Even if you're being straight, it was my crew. It didn't go down that way. Come clean, or Ivory's gonna take you apart, piece by piece. I don't wanna see that. Look, Griff has it. It has to be him. He's the only one left. I had eyes on him until your cleaner brought me in here. Check his burner. Got it. Check the last message he sent. Nothing. If I don't get the goods, I have no problem walking away with loose ends. That means you and your girl. Are you fucking kidding me? She has nothing to do with this. Not from where I'm standing. You're a tough mick, Frank. Squeezing you might be a waste of time. It doesn't mean that I'm not gonna give it the old college try. Griff was making his way down onto the platform. If he sees Ivory, he's gonna bolt. Send me in there. I can flush him out. You good with that, Ive? IVORY: I've got it covered. REX: On my way. Let's load 'em up. We're rolling out of this place. What the hell do you think you're doing? Careful, Richard. Be very careful. [chuckling] You just couldn't get past that blind spot, huh? For fuckin' Frank Sullivan. You've already paid me $500,000 for the crew. If those jewels are worth $30 million on the black market, then I am the best fence in town. Hey, what do I need you for? Smile, boys, we cut out the middleman! Let's go. MAN ON P.A.: Your Cincinnati Union Terminal welcomes you to Cincinnati. Limited from Chicago, now arriving on the upper concourse. Regional buses are accessible on the lower concourse. Regional line with outbound service to Indianapolis... Keep this floor traffic moving. Cincinnati Police remind you to travel safe and report all suspicious persons. If you see something, say something. CLAIRE: No, I know. Frank, get over here. Griffin is right behind you. Griffin is the least of our troubles. Ivory's got a gun pointed at my head right now. When I go after Griffin, you get through that door, and you get as far away from here as possible, understand? Go. Experience a day at the zoo. Smoking is allowed in designated areas only. Cincinnati Police remind you to travel safe and report all suspicious persons. If you see something, say something. Your Cincinnati Union Terminal welcomes you to Cincinnati. [people screaming] Get down, get down! Attention, attention. All passengers and personnel are requested to evacuate the terminal. Are we talking or fighting, Frank? You want the whole score to yourself, that's one thing. But after what you did to Joe, fuck you, we're fighting! I'd never do that to you, Frank! What are you talking about? You brought me into this gig! Heat's coming down, crew's gone, and here you are making a run for it. What do you expect, Frank? You lost your goddamned mind? Why, Griff? Why'd you do it? I didn't do anything, Frank! Yeah? What's in that bag? You tell me, asshole. As far as I'm concerned, it was a bust. You were in control of the alarm system. I didn't trigger the fucking thing. Soon as I came out of the security room, the cops were already there. We were fucking set up, Frank! I went out the back garage. [gun cocks] Drop the gun, Frank. Drop it. [thud] We were a crew, man. Oh, we were family, man. Marshall? Baxter? Both of those motherfuckers tried to kill me. They kept pointing the finger at you. How the fuck was it supposed to be me if I was still in the fucking security room when you came out of the vault? I got cracked in the back of the head, I woke up, and Joe's dead next to me. Who else is it gonna be? You're the last man! Joey's dead? You didn't know. You didn't know. Shit, I'm sorry, Frank. I'll be a son of a bitch. If it's not you, then who? What the fuck happened, man? [gunshots] Jesus Christ! Griffin! Griffie! Frank. Don't even think about it. Now move. Over there. Easy. You got what you want. I don't even know what it is. This isn't gonna go down the way you want it to, Frank. Where is it? Fuck. You'll never know if you shoot me. [gunshots] [chuckles] For once, I'm glad you didn't listen. Try to stay focused, Frank. You Sullivan boys are saps. Must run in the family. You gotta be shittin' me. All wrapped up, neat with a bow. But you couldn't leave well enough alone. Gotta give it to you though. All I had to do was point you in the right direction and squeeze. [glass shatters] [ticking] Why? You'd have plenty with Joe's share. His share? 500 grand doesn't begin to cover the markers he owed. You've been playing me this whole time. I did save your ass from Ivory, didn't I? I just didn't expect you to come calling earlier today. But I rode along, watched you hunt down the rest of the guys. Let's settle up, okay? Your money's no good here. Thanks. It was ours. He was giving it all away with his stupid even split. So I cut it my way. Joe told me whoever delivered the case at the end of the day gets the full 500 grand. How'd you know which out we'd take? A girl like me, I'd heard about Joe's reputation for always chasing the big score. Even when he worked all the angles, the chips never fell his way. OPERATOR: 911, what's your emergency? There's an armed robbery in progress at the Mann Chandler Bank downtown. Please hurry. They just shot my manager. [alarm blaring] [siren wailing] Charlie 326, show me arrival and hold the air. Hey, we got a report of shots fired, and we are not waiting. JOE: Fuck this. Let's clear the area and go straight to Claire's. That wasn't part of the plan. I'm not trusting anything we had set up with Rex. Let's get to Claire and get the fuck out of the city. - Fuck. - [glass shatters] - Get over there. - What the fuck are you doing? - Toss me the case. - We don't have time for this! I will not hesitate to kill him. Now throw me the case. Jesus. The key. Where's the key? It's no good without the key. - I don't have the key. - Bullshit! You worked it all out, every detail. I don't have it. It wasn't part of the plan. Can he open this? I brought you in on this thing. For pennies on the dollar, baby. No, thanks. Now tell me, can your brother open this or not? You greedy bitch. I wasted 10 years of my life in that bar. And for what? A finder's fee every time guys like you took down a big score? Everything good? Everything's perfect. I just didn't count on you surviving. But I figured I could always use someone to help me cover my tracks. The big kahuna would send out Ivory, and I don't wanna be a part of any of that shit. It's probably Rex's boys trying to squeeze me to come in. Sorry, baby. It's a bitter little world. Why didn't you just shoot me when you had the chance? Never walk into a place you don't know how to get out of. Sound familiar? I've got what you're looking for. Case is secure. ROBOTIC VOICE: Same deal as before. $500,000. 10 p.m. Place, TBD. Get up. How long ago did Griffin leave? What are you talking about? - Frank! - Hold on! I'm not going to ask you again. - Jesus, like 30 minutes ago. - Where? I don't know. All I heard was something about Union Station, and that's all I know. - Jesus. - What did you do? He went for a gun. I'm sorry. [scoffs] I just didn't count on you lasting this long. Fuck it. We're in the construction zone. You're wearing Kevlar? Diamonds. So much for honor among thieves. We'll call this a down payment on the next one. Sorry about your brother. It's time to get back on the clock.
