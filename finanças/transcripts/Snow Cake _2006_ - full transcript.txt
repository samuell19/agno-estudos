Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. We will shortly be approaching Timmins airport. Local time is 6:30. It's a beautiful spring morning, and the temperature is approximately seven degrees with occasional light snow flurries. I hope you've had a pleasant flight and enjoy your stay here in Northern Ontario. Do you want more coffee? Yes. Thank you. Do you mind if I sit here? No. Can I take your order? Yes, please. I'll have a Coke, please. Diet? Yeah, I've tried. It's just the"no eating" part that I struggle with. I'm kidding. I'll have a Diet Coke, yes. Thanks. What are you reading? Wipe The Slate, Light The Candle. Is that a novel? It's fiction. Hmm. I've been thinking of writing one of those. You can make tons of money. All the gullible people out there, searching for answers. I have the best title."The Bleeding Child Within." What do you think? It's very good. I don't know what particular area of human pain or misery I'm going to focus it on yet. I just like the title. Thanks. I don't want to waste it. You're English, right? Look, you seem like a really chatty kind of person, and I don't want to be rude, but I'm not chatty. So, perhaps you'd be better off sitting somewhere else. Have you seen some of these people? Oh, there's a few empty tables around. Do you want to know why I sat here? Because you look like a man who needs to talk. You look like a guy who hasn't talked in a really long time. -That's why you sat here? -That is why I sat here. And because I need a lift. And you were the cleanest option. I'm sorry. Good luck. Change of heart? No, I just tried to change gear. It's automatic. Oh, okay. Well, good luck. I'm driving to Winnipeg. You better get out when I've had enough. Yes. Absolutely. No problem. Bit of a drive, Winnipeg. -I'm Vivienne, by the way. -Alex. I have to tell you, I just got out of prison. Oh. Fraud? I killed someone. Okay. -So, about this person you killed... -I don't want to talk about it. I only mentioned it because I wanted you to be aware that ordinary-looking people are often the ones you need to avoid. Okay. Gotcha. Look out for the ordinary ones. -So you're feeling uneasy now? -Nope. -Sure? -Well, maybe a little. Uneasy. I tend not to visit"scared". My mum is scared of everything, and I've made a conscious decision not to go there. If I hadn't been starving, I wouldn't have stopped at that diner. That's what I call frightening. You can't be afraid of tattoos and bad teeth. It's part of their appeal. -I don't really think they'd hurt anyone. -I was talking about the food. Oh. You got kids? No. Really? At your age? No kids. Low sperm count? -More of a low partner count. -Ah, I know the feeling. Guys my age just don't like me. Mind you, you're quite an attractive-looking guy. What's your excuse? I don't want to talk about it. There's a surprise. So we're here, sharing a meal. You know, if I was a few years older, this would be a date. -A few? You're very generous! -Mmm-hmm, I know how the world works. I give a little something, you give a little something. All right, all right. Both my parents are dead, and I have one brother. That wasn't so hard! He hates me. Whoa there! Nothing, and then the floodgates open. Go, Alex. Go, Alex. We're completely different. He's handsome and very fit, works at the stock exchange. He's what you might call a hot shot. A"hot shot"? Well, you know what they say."Behind every successful man is a truly astonished woman." -Is that what they say? -Yeah, that's what they say. He's gay. That's my point exactly! Oh, I did good! And look at these. -Flashing balls that play music. -Just what she's always wanted. You do not know my mother, Mr Sarcastic. She's gonna be beside herself when she sees these. I can't wait to see her face! Oh, I love this song. ("ALL RIGHTNOW" BY FREE PLAYING) # Let's move before they raise the parking rate "# Ow! All right now # Baby, it's all right now # All right now Baby, it's all right now # Vivienne. Are you okay? Vivienne! Oh, fuck, fuck. Are you okay? Are you okay? Just stay... -Someone's in the car. -Stay. Stay. Don't get up. -There's somebody still in the car. -Don't move. Get her out of the car. Calm down, sir. Calm down. Sir, relax. I'm sorry. Let's go. She's inside the car. You have to get her out of there. Mr Hughes? I'm going to have to ask you to hang around for a while, couple of days tops. Just till we get all the statements in. Procedure, you understand? Clyde, that urgent stuff has just arrived, do you want me to... Oh, okay, Meryl. I'm sorry, Mr Hughes, I'm just going to have to... My officer managed to retrieve some of your things. We can get the rest to you once they've been released. Anyway, I'd appreciate if you'd just check there's nothing of Miss Freeman's in there. -And I'll see you out front. -I'd like to speak to her mother. I'm sorry? Vivienne's mother. -It's always a difficult time for the family. -I realise that. Well, with respect, sir, I don't think you do. If your daughter was killed in an accident, would you want to speak to the driver? I didn't kill Vivienne. The driver of the truck killed Vivienne. Yes, but it wouldn't be very professional of me to go giving out personal information. Would it? Goodbye, Florence. Yes? -I'd like to talk to Mrs Freeman. -Why? Mrs Freeman, may I come in? -Do I know you? -No. My name is Alex Hughes. I just wanted to talk to you for a couple of minutes. About what? I'm very busy and I don't do social. The police have been, haven't they? Yes. The police were here two hours and twenty minutes ago. -So you know what's happened? -Yes. I know Vivienne is dead. Is that it? I just wanted to explain. I gave your daughter a lift. It was an accident. I'm so sorry. Okay. It's just that Vivienne bought you something. She said you'd like them. -Sparklies? She got me sparklies? -Yeah. Are you okay? Take off your outdoor shoes and put them in the row. Don't move any of the others. Oh, I'm supposed to offer you something. Would you like an herbal tea? I have 17 varieties. -Yes, let me... -No, don't come in my kitchen. That's off-limits. I'm gonna give you the liquorice one. I can't stomach the liquorice one. It tastes like cat pee. Are you alone here? Yes. If anybody... I could stay with you for a couple of days. -I have two parents. They're hiking in Algonquin. No one can get a signal. Maybe the police could put you in touch with someone to talk to. -Someone qualified. -About what? -About what's happened. -Okay. I just came to explain... I don't handle this sort of thing well at all. -Oh, give me your clothes. -I'm sorry? Take off your clothes. Give them to me. I'll give them back. I don't want the wet contaminating my carpet. Take off your clothes. I'm getting you dry ones. By the way, that's my third-favourite sweater, so you can't keep it. Don't look at me. I'm doing my checking. I check the kitchen every time I use it. And every time I don't use it. -That must take up a lot of time. -Yes, it does. That's Marilyn, Vivienne's dog. I can't stand her. So did Vivienne live here with you all the time? Yes. Vivienne came on a short stay three years ago and didn't leave. She lived with my parents until then. That's who she was visiting. Why was she hitchhiking? Vivienne wanted to be a writer. She said she would always try and get a ride with the most lonely-looking characters because they had the best stories. Mrs Freeman. This is all a bit difficult for me. I came here to apologise because your daughter died and it was my car. Did you do it on purpose? -Of course not. We'd just stopped at the... -Sit down, then. And I'm not a missus, I'm Linda. I haven't got a problem with you. You must be all right because you gave Vivienne a lift and you brought me my sparklies. Is there a problem with the tea? No, no, it's not the tea. Are you sad because someone you didn't know died? This is guilt, Linda. I feel guilty, okay? Right, because you were driving. -Yes, because I was driving. -But he ran into you. Yes, he ran into me. Right. Linda! What is she doing here again? She's already been here once today. I'm not letting her in again. Linda! Go away, Florence. Nobody wants you here! Get lost! -Linda, I just want to... -Whatever it is, I don't need it. Go away! Alex, tell her to go away. Tell her. Oh. -Hello. -Hello. I really think Linda needs someone to stay with her tonight. -No, I don't. You're stupid! -It's all right, Linda. I'm only here to help! Whatever it is, I don't need it. Leave me alone. I really don't think she wants to talk about it any more tonight. And you are? Alex Hughes. Goodbye, Florence. Are you staying? -No, no, I... -Yes, he's staying! Alex Hughes is staying, and if you come back I'm calling the police. Okay, you have my number! Linda, I can't stay. Well, you'll have to give me my sweater back. -I should call a taxi. -They won't pick up from this house. -Not after last time. -What about a bus? It's too late. -Is there a hotel? -Yes. -Where is it? -It's four miles up the highway. -I should get my clothes. -They haven't finished their cycle. -Do you want tea? -No. Would you like to go out and play? I have a trampoline. -I'll just get my things. -I think you should stay until Tuesday. -I'm sorry. -They collect the garbage on Tuesday. I don't do garbage. -Linda, I appreciate the offer, but... -It was Vivienne's job. I can't touch garbage. So you'll have to take the bags out now. -Do you want food? -Linda, I'm sorry but I can't do this. I'll just get my clothes and then I have to leave. You can't... Don't go in my kitchen! I'll get your stupid clothes! -Now what are you doing? -Fuck. I'm sorry. I didn't know this was your room. Where are you going? Stay still. I saw the bunk beds and I thought... Vivienne says I'm probably the only adult in the entire world who has a bunk bed. I've tried other beds and I don't like them. I've slept in this bed since I was three. -I'll find somewhere else to sleep. -No, no. Get back under here. I need to know where you are. I don't want you pounding around my house. Do you snore? I don't know. Well, lie down and go to sleep. I need my rest. And if you try and touch me, I'll shoot you. I have a gun. Can you see the stars? # The stars at night are shining bright Deep in the heart of Wawa # Linda, I hope you don't mind. I ate a cracker. -You what? You went in my kitchen? -Yes. -I'm sorry, I was a bit hungry. -I don't care. I cleaned up afterwards. "Hi, this is the madhouse." Leave us a message and we'll probably get back to you. Please speak slowly and be precise. Linda. The phone. Linda? You all right? I'm fine. If you get your mouth completely full of snow, it all dissolves and you can drink it. It's your... Aren't you cold? I have an unusual body temperature control. It feels just right. Have you ever had an orgasm, Alex? It has been known. Vivienne once described an orgasm to me. It sounds like an inferior version of what I feel when I have a mouth full of snow. You should try it. Hi. I heard about Vivienne. I'm so sorry. I really liked her. She all right? I don't know. -What exactly is it? -Autism. But she's very verbal. I had noticed. Are you all right? -I don't know. -I'm Maggie. And everybody's been saying that it wasn't your fault. -Alex. -I know. It's a very small town. So has anyone been feeding that dog? In a manner of speaking. Well, if she needs anything, I'm right here. Not that she'll talk to me. Bye. Alex. Alex, we have to make a snowman. Do we? Vivienne came to visit me every year, and we always made a crazy creature snowman. We kept on doing it. We haven't made one this year. Linda, there's a message on the machine from your parents. Let's make a chipmunk! We never made a chipmunk. I love chipmunks. From now on, every time I miss Vivienne, I'm going to make a crazy creature snowman. "Hi folks, it's only Mom and Dad." We're just ringing to let you know we're fine. "Hello!" "Your dad got an icicle embedded" in his privates yesterday. "Don't ask." "But apart from that we're A-okay." Now, we hope everything's fine with you and that Vivvy got back all right. We'll ring you again when we can get to the next pit stop. We're miles away from anywhere! "Ellen, come on, they get the message." Okay, now, keep warm. Love you both." "Bye!" You should really try to get a hold of them. They'd want to be here. I have to go identify Vivienne's body today. And tomorrow is work. And Tuesday they collect the garbage. -Work? -I work part-time at the Valu-mart. I stack shelves. Will you come with me? To work? I don't think they'll be expecting you at work. No, to see Vivienne's body. Will you come with me? I have to work or I won't get paid. Well... If you want me to, yeah. I have to go in to the police station anyway to pick up my stuff, and then I should be on my way. I don't know why I have to go. Everyone knows it's her. -It's just procedure. -I've seen it on TV. They always let two people come in the room with them. So will you come in the room with me? Yes. If you want me to. -Do people like you, Alex? -Not much, no. I'm not surprised. It's because those glasses don't look right on your face. You have a long face, and those glasses make you look shifty. -Really? -Yes. -You need some new frames. -I think it'll take more than that. I know how you neuro-typical people are obsessed with having friends. I'm only trying to help you get some. Well, I appreciate your efforts, but in my experience friends can be overrated. There. Now you look almost nice. Mrs Freeman, is this your daughter? -Miss Freeman. -I'm sorry. Miss Freeman. Miss Freeman, is this your daughter? Linda, is this Vivienne? She looks different. I'm sorry, Linda, I need a verbal identification. Is this Vivienne Freeman? Yes. Yes, it is. Come on, let's get you home. -Don't talk to me now until I say so. -Okay. Linda. Linda, oh, I was so sorry to hear about Marianne. -Vivienne. -Vivienne. Vivienne. Oh, she was such a personality. Diane. Diane Wootten. Why I keep that name I'll never know. Been divorced two years. Alex. Alex Hughes. Oh, now I know you're not a native. -Not with that delectable accent. -No. Linda, if there's anything I can do for you. Anything at all. -Like what? -Well, like anything. It must be so awful losing a child like that. -I didn't lose her. She's dead. -Linda. -What? -It's perfectly all right. I know all about autism. I've seen that film. Okay, well, you take care of yourself, Linda. I'll be keeping my eye on you. Nice meeting you, Alex. Sure it won't be the last time. Have you made up your mind about the funeral, Linda? You have to decide what to do. The service, the flowers, the people. -It's not a wedding! -No, but it takes a lot of sorting out. It's important to get it right. If we have the funeral on Monday, would you stay until Tuesday? -To put the bins out. -The garbage cans, yes. I don't do garbage. Okay, here's what I'll do. I'll stay and help organise the funeral. -And then you'll... -Yes, then I'll put the garbage out. -On Tuesday. -Yes. -Perfectamundo. -But then I have to go. You better tell me about what you think Vivienne would want. I know what Vivienne would want. She'd want to be alive. -What was she pestering you about? -Who? This morning. That Maggie, from next door. I think she just wanted to pay her respects. She's a prostitute, Alex. I don't think she has much respect to give. "...remember when I noticed my eyebrows, but I know that's when it all started." "What is the moment worth?" "The past is only a memory, the future a fantasy. "It's only in the present that we truly live." Okay, Vivienne. See you later. Have a good one. -Hello. Again. -Hello. I just came around to... It's a bit of a clich?, really. To borrow some tea. Normal tea. -And that would be to drink with the fruitcake? -She's not mad. No, I know. Vivienne explained it all to me. "High functioning, can talk a glass eye to sleep but can't tie her shoelaces." -Don't you like her? -She doesn't like me, for some reason. -So did you really come around for tea? -Have you got any? Assam. Darjeeling. There is a God. No. There is FedEx. An English friend of mine sent it over. Don't go inventing a deity to thank for the small miracles. -They just happen. -So you're a non-believer. I am. Which makes me a bit of a novelty around here. Then again, so's Linda. It's a judgemental town, this. The emphasis being on the mental. -I assume you're new to the area. -Oh, no. No. I've lived here for 1 2 years. So how are you holding up? I keep seeing her face. She was singing. She had all this energy, and I walked away without a scratch. -So are you planning on staying here for a while? -Apparently. Until after the funeral. That's very sweet of you. Listen, I... I don't know what kind of plans you have with my neighbour, but I'm free tonight. And, I don't know, I could cook something. We could have dinner, maybe. Thank you. # There's things I want # There's things I think I want # There's things I've had # There's things I wanna have # What are you listening to? Just trying to find something for Vivienne. Stereophonics. They're not bad. I prefer tinnitus. Linda, can I ask, if you don't like people, how did you manage with Vivienne? I don't like normal people, I like useful people. And people who like doing the things I like doing. Vivienne was very helpful to me. We had a lot of fun. I know how you must be feeling. I had a son... You don't know how I'm feeling, because you're not me. ...who died. Nobody knows how I'm feeling because half the time I don't have a clue. Well, I know how that feels, too. When I found out about... Do you want to go out and play on the trampoline? No. No, thank you. We could make a snowman. Well, I was gonna tell you about my son but now I think I'll just sit here, if it's okay with you. Did your son like the snow? No. No. That was one of the few things he didn't like. Oh. Did you know that no two snowflakes are alike? Wilson Bentley photographed 2,354 snowflakes. His best snowstorm was on his birthday on February 1 4th, 1 928, when he was 6 3. He called it"a gift from kind winter". Is it okay if I take the dog out in a bit? Don't let her pee on my snow. -Hi. -Hi. Right on time. I didn't know... I'm sure this isn't the norm but I brought you some tea bags. Ginseng and fennel. I find"the norm" usually involves chocolate, or if I'm really lucky, perfume. But ginseng and fennel, wow! Come in. And the dog comes too. So, Mr Snow Drifter, what's your story? -Me? Oh, there's nothing much to say, really. -Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at your face that you have some interesting baggage. I don't have baggage. I have haulage. -See, I told you. You just look so... -Shifty? Mmm-mmm. Sad. I hope you like shrimp cocktail. It's what I normally serve my gentleman callers. I'm afraid it's not very original but I really hate to cook. After Linda's specialised diet, believe me, I'd eat grit. Everything's gluten-free. She has leaky gut syndrome. -As well as a ringing in her ears. -Wow! -So what about you? -What, disease-wise? No. -You, generally. -Oh, me. I know, I like to keep an air of mystery about me, at least on the first date. -Really? -Mmm-hmm. So how long are you planning on staying? You are very beautiful. I'm leaving after the funeral. I like you. I really like you. And I hate having sex on a full stomach, so should we just skip the main course and go next door? Oh, shit, I forgot about the English reserve thing. Okay. I'm sorry. I've embarrassed you. Let's just eat. No. No, it's fine. If I'm honest, it's what I came round for. Well, good, I'm glad we cleared that up. It's been a while. Sorry if it was a bit quick. I think the dog might have put me off. It's okay. We have all night. So why are you going to Winnipeg? -You ask a lot of questions. -Do I? I'm going to meet an old friend. A"friend" friend or a"friend" friend? I should go. I won't mention her again. I promise. Why didn't you just fly straight there like a normal person? Well, I thought I'd try and take in some of the lakes. It didn't look far on the map. Would you even consider driving from London to Moscow? Actually, I was looking on a globe. The scale was a bit off. I think you're ready to try again. Hey. I should go. I haven't done this kind of thing before. I'm sorry. How much do I owe you? What? For last night. What do I... You want to pay me? Well, I thought... Oh, God, you're not, are you? -It's just that Linda... -Okay, yeah, I have a few male callers now and again, and yes, I like sex, -but no, I am not a hooker. -Oh, shit, I feel dreadful. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I have to say I'm more than relieved. What, you're not a big fan of ladies of the night? I didn't think I'd have enough money to see you as much as I want to. Oh, my God. Linda, I booked the cars for 12:00, is that all right? I'm going to work. What do you think? Okay. -What's the matter, Linda? What is it? -No! -It's on the rug. It's disgusting. -No, it's okay, Linda. It's okay. It's dog throw-up from inside the dog's stomach. -It's gonna make an unbelievably bad stain. -Linda, it's okay. It's not okay. It's not okay. I can't do this. I can't do this! -I need Vivienne. I need Vivienne. -Well, I... I'll sort it. Please! Please don't let it leave a stain. -If it leaves a stain, I have to move! -Linda! I said I'll sort it. Oh, please don't let it leave a stain. And don't go in my kitchen! -Al? -Oh, hello. -Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. I'm so glad. -What's she been eating? -Don't know. Linda gives her bananas. Bananas? She's not a monkey. I don't know much about dogs. You know about dog vomit, right? Yeah. Keep her off the bananas. I've heard you can get this stuff in cans. Dog food. -Controversial, I know. -Yeah. Actually, this isn't a social call today. Really? I just came to warn you about Alex Hughes. Several little birds have told me you and he are getting social. I don't think that's any of your business, Clyde, or anyone else's. Honestly, this town is getting so that you can't cough without someone alerting the authorities. Yeah. I looked him up on our system. He killed someone. Did you know? No, he was driving the car, but it wasn't his fault. I'm not talking about Vivienne. He killed a guy. He just got out. -I didn't know that. -Thought you should. Now I do. And, to top it all, he hit a cop. Just ask yourself this, Maggie. Is that normal? Picking up young girls? Staying with a mentally challenged lady? Killing people? Hitting cops? Well. Oh, I've a spare ticket for a magician up at the Legion on Wednesday, if you're interested. What's he gonna do, Clyde? Make you disappear? B-A-A-N-G. You can't have two A's in"bang". In comic book word Scrabble you can. You can have three A's if you want. With a double-letter score, that makes 22 points. -This game is ridiculous. -No, it isn't. It isn't, because you get to say words like "Kerrang","Boing","Cowabunga","Buttocks". What comic book did that come out of? I don't know. I just like saying"buttocks". Buttocks. Okay, what's your word? -I can make it up, right? -Yes. That's the best bit. Okay. Y-A-A- M-O-O-L. That's four, five, six... That's 24 points. "Yaamool.""Yaamool", I like that. Yaamool. Okay, now you have to give an example of it in a sentence. Like I said, if you make up a word, you have to give an example. All right. -Spiderman... -Spiderman? -What's wrong with Spiderman? -Well, it's a bit obvious. Oh, all right. Spiderman. Spiderman is about to save the universe from an evil thing. And... So he hits him with a jet of web. Yaamool! And it stops him, it, in its tracks. You are terrible at this game. I got two more points than you. D-A-Z- L-I-O-U-S. Dazlious. -I'm assuming that's a made-up word. -It is. It's also 38 points for the word and another 50 for using up all my letters. -That makes 88 points. -And your example? Mister Fantastic from the Fantastic Four, he's got arms made of elastic so they can stretch for two, maybe 300 miles. He's been imprisoned in a cave for seven days with no food and no water and no light. And on the eighth day, he manages to loosen a rock and push his way up through the top. With his stretchy arms. And up into the daylight, just as the sun is coming up over the mountains, and filling the sky with this white-yellow light, and there's a stillness. And in the few minutes he's got before his captor, the evil Doctor Doom, returns, he stops for one second. And all he can hear is his own breathing. And he's totally overwhelmed by how big the world is and how small and unimportant he is. And as he turns around, we see his face look to the sky, and he says, very quietly, so that no one can hear him... He says,"Dazlious." Time to make some tea. I can see if I'm going to have any chance of winning this game, I'm going to really need to focus. You know where to find me. You know, I've had a bit of a shady past. Oh, really? -I was married for 1 5 years. -Arrest this woman now. He was a very nice man. But I had affairs. I like the candies and the flowers, the teabags bit. I'm just not good at the day-to-day stuff, you know. I'm a selfish woman and I broke his heart. Made a real mess of it, actually. So someone said you can drink this water. Yeah, it's supposed to have healing properties. Why don't you take a sip? -I don't think so. -What, you don't want to be healed? -Set free of your demons? -They keep me company. -I think we should be getting Marilyn back. -You know, Alex, I think maybe your dog's been getting a little too much exercise lately. Perhaps, you could try walking it at home. In the privacy of your own bathroom. What exactly is it that you want to know? Everything. That's Ryan. My son. What? You said you didn't have any kids. I got a letter from Ryan. His mum had finally allowed him to see his birth certificate, and I was on it under"Father". And are you his real dad? Yes. His mum's name's Rebecca. She's the woman that I'm going to see in Winnipeg. We had a short fling. I suppose she thought that I was never that serious, so she... It was 22 years ago. What did he say to you? He wrote me a list of all the things he liked and all the things he hated. I mean, when you saw him. We arranged to meet in a restaurant. I sat in the restaurant until closing time, and he never showed up. He was in an accident on the way to meet me. -Got hit by a drunk driver and he died instantly. -Oh, my God. -That is terrible. -I never even met him. -So all I lost, really, was a fantasy. -Oh, my God. A fucking fantasy. I spent the last four years grieving over someone I never knew, and now I'm doing it all over again with Vivienne. Come here. Come here. "Good morning, I'm Mark Scott." And I'm here every morning, all morning... No, not those, dude. Those are serial killer. Getting warmer. You know what, though? Yeah, I think these are the guys for you. Oh, yeah. Am I good or what? Actually, I think I'll just stick to my old ones. I was just browsing, really. Eye-browsing. Right? -Thanks for your time. -It's cool. -Love the accent, by the way. -Thank you. I... I came to talk to Linda. She won't open the door. Only to say sorry. So did I and I'm still here. Mind you, I wasn't the one ramming a 40-ton truck into her daughter. Look, man, I'm not a killer, it was an accident. -I've lost my job... -My heart bleeds. Well, haven't you ever made a fucking mistake? -I think you should go. -I can't go. Not until I've... Until you've what? You lost your job? She lost her fucking daughter, and not just any daughter, one who would have helped her to make some sense of all this shit! You bought flowers, you thick bastard. -Come on, then. -Just get out of here. Come on, then! Let me have it. Let me have it! Come on, come on! Just don't push me. What's the matter? You can't finish the job? Come on! Don't you know you can't hurt me? Don't you know I'm fucking indestructible? What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm trampolining. Linda... Could you stop bouncing for a minute? I want to tell you about what happened with my son. I went to prison. -I went to prison because... -I want you to bounce me up. Not now, Linda. Is it because you had a fight with the truck driver? Yes. I won't see Vivienne again, you won't see Vivienne again and he won't see Vivienne again. We all have to get over it. Okay. Now, bounce me up. I'm not moving until you play with me. I'm gonna stay out here all night long. Please. Please, Alex. Please, please, please bounce me. Promise to let everyone come back tomorrow after the funeral? Yippee! Yes, yes, yes! Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce! You worried about tomorrow? I think it's done. I'm worried about Linda. It must be weird not wanting to be with other people. Not needing anyone to, you know, plug into. Don't you go worrying about her on that account. She's got quite enough going on inside that head of hers. But she needs other people to do things for her if not necessarily with her. Vivienne did all the boring stuff. What's she going to do now? You offering? Wouldn't get past the door. -I'm beginning to like this. -What's that? Being with you. Being with Linda. Being with myself. Again. Hey, and I'm having sex, and these muffins are great. That sort of thing. You be careful, Mr Shifty. Sorry to call so early, it's just we had a collection. We got a wreath for the church, but I also wanted to bring a little something else I had done. Oh, that's very kind. Is she in? Oh, yes. Linda! Linda! I like your robe. Diane's brought you something. -What is it? -It's a bereavement cookie. -I can't eat that. -Oh? -She's gluten free. -Oh, right. Well, waste not want not. I'll take it back. It's my nephew's fifth birthday tomorrow. So I'll scrape the icing off. Put some new numbers on. -A nice new number five. -I'll scrape it. There. Well, I'll see you both in church later. -Thanks, Diane. -Bye. Despite both our faults, Linda, I actually think we work quite well together, don't you? Yes, I do. Can you please take the dog out now? I don't want to talk to you any more. Shall I come back in about half an hour? I don't know how I'll feel in half an hour. I only know how I feel now. Hello. You must be Alex. I'm Dirk. And this is Ellen. How do you do? I'm sorry. I'd told myself I wasn't gonna cry. Every time we go away it's always Linda we're worried about. Isn't it, Dirk? We never even gave Vivienne a second thought. We never thought... Ellen's a bit upset. We've been hiking. We came straight here. -Yeah. -Is Linda inside? I'm half inside, half outside. Hi, sweetie. Hi. We've just been meeting Alex, Linda. -Your eyes are red. -Yes, they are. -Mommy, cheek. -Yeah, that's my girl. -I'll let you have some time. -Yes. Thank you, Alex. I thought Vivienne would appreciate something a bit unconventional. Perfectamundo. Is it compulsory to cry at funerals? No. It's not compulsory. Good, because I don't know if I will or not. Wilson Bentley, the man who photographed snowflakes, died after walking in a snowstorm. Is there anything you need? Yes. I'd like you to put your arms around me and squeeze me really hard, but don't touch me with your hands. Say when. (PLAYING "JUSTLOOKING" BY THE STEREOPHONICS) Linda? Linda? Please sit down. For those who don't know, I am Vivienne's grandad. But as our daughter, Linda, was unable to look after her, my wife, Ellen, and I raised Vivienne as our own for 1 6 years. Vivienne was a real one-off, and the most gentle and generous person I have ever met. She had an amazing ability, accepting people for what they are, embracing their differences. Most of you are probably aware that Vivienne wanted to be a writer. On her last visit to us, only a week or so ago, she gave me a children's picture book that she was working on. I'd like to read it to you because it says more about Vivienne than anything I could put into words. "My Little Brother. My little brother, James, is special. "My little brother is four and he can't talk yet. "He doesn't always understand what I say to him, "and he's not a bit interested in my wrestling toys. "Dad plays chasing games with him and tries to get him interested in rockets and football. "But my little brother really only likes the alphabet. "He's very happy when we have alphabet spaghetti for lunch, but then, so am I." "Yesterday he took my hands and danced with me. "Every time he does something new, however small, "it's a brilliant feeling. "I wish everyone could get to know someone like my little brother. "He makes you look at things in a brand-new way. "Some people say that James won't ever do the things I do, but it doesn't matter. "He'll just do different things. "I love my little brother so much and one day I know he'll tell me he loves me, too. "Although he'll probably spell it out in spaghetti first." Thank you, Dirk. Now please stand while we take a moment to listen to one of Vivienne's favourite records, by the, er... Super Furry Animals. ("HELLO SUNSHINE" BY THE SUPER FURRY ANIMALS PLAYING) Hello. Thank you so much. Please take your shoes off before entering. Anything for you? No? Excuse me. Why is that man still here? Oh, Linda, hand these around. All these people doing social in my house. -It's okay, Linda. -It's not okay, it's horrible. When are they gonna go? -Well, they'll have a sandwich and then they'll go. Just what do you see in him, Maggie? You know, Clyde, you have a superior air about you. Who ever told you you were so special? Who ever told you you weren't? It's surprisingly clean, eh? That's the thing about autism. They're neat freaks. Yeah? You should take notes. You could learn something. -Why do you have to do that? -What? -Why do you have to be like that? -It's a joke. Try one of these. They are gluten-free. You know, Alex is very fond of you. He talks about you all the time. Maybe when he's gone, I could come over and... Why would I want you to come over? They've had their sandwiches. Why are they hanging around? -Thank you so much for coming. -No, really, it's just... Funny place, this. Never felt at home here. But Linda always liked it. We bought it for her because she wanted to be independent. Especially after Vivienne was born. How did that happen? We still don't know. She was very close... Well, relatively close to a boy who went to the Centre. We all assumed it was an experiment. She didn't seem remotely upset at first. But she might have been forced. We asked and we asked. Anyhow, she was six months gone before anyone noticed. It's like everything with Linda. You have to accept her totally. And somehow Vivienne understood that from very early on. Oh, she would have loved the service. And this, too. She loved a party. You know, I don't think there's ever been more than five people in this house. I don't know how you persuaded her. But anyway, I just wanted to say thanks. For staying. You didn't have to. Actually, to be honest, the elements were against me. I didn't really have an alternative. There's always an alternative, Alex. This house is getting nasty, nasty, nasty! ("KITAKA SASSA" BY TAKEMI KAKIZAKI PLAYING) It's all right, honey. You going? Linda, I think you should stop now! No, that's all right. Leave her alone. She's okay. -She's fine. -But this is a wake, for heaven's sake. She's fine. Just let her dance. Please! It's like getting back on your bike. You'll be fine. There's no point in worrying it'll happen again. Nothing you can do. If it's coming, it's coming. Thank you, Clyde, that's very reassuring. Can't say I'm sad to see you go. -Don't tell me. Maggie? -Yep. -Do you think she'll ever... -No. Drive safely, then. Hi! I am never having that many people in my house ever again. -Where are your parents? -I told them to go. I had to clean the house. -They'll be back tomorrow. -Oh, right. I'd liked to have said goodbye. I'm going to take Marilyn for a walk. -Don't forget about the... -Garbage. I know. 12:00. -Hi. -We've just come to say goodbye. We? Any chance you'll keep an eye on her? She'd be dead in a week, otherwise. Who? Linda or the dog? She didn't take long to settle in. Maybe I should do the same. Saw this house in the real estate window in town. It's by the lake. Kind of tempting. -Stupid idea. -I told you I was selfish. You did. I hope you find what you're looking for in Winnipeg. Hmm, wonder what that is. Good luck to me. Maggie, I killed a man. The driver who ran into my son. I found out his name, where he lived. I went there and I hit him. Hard. He fell. He fell onto this stone floor. He cracked his head open. I know. Clyde told me. -Why didn't you... -I was waiting for you to mention it. I'm glad you did. You know, mostly he's upset that you hit a cop. Thanks. I think you're gonna find peace when you get there. You'll probably end up staying. But if you're ever passing through here again, I... I've had a really nice time. Gotta do the garbage. Gotta do the garbage. Garbage, garbage, gotta do the garbage. Gotta do the garbage. Garbage... They're already two hours late. Maybe they're not coming today. What if we do what everybody else in the street does, what everybody else in the world does, and put the bags out? Then if they don't turn up today, you can leave them out until they do. No! No, we're not going to do that. The bags will split, and that's when raccoons come. Raccoons have rabies and they mess up the snow. I'm sorry, Linda, I don't know what else I can do. I've got to get going. I've already made arrangements. -You are a very selfish man. -No, I'm not, you're just unreasonable. -I'm autistic! -That's the same thing. Apart from today you have been very helpful, Alex, and I wanna say thank you. You're not as interesting as Vivienne was but you have some quite good characteristics. Don't go overboard with the praise there, Linda. So, Linda... I'm really going to have to go very soon. You have been very annoying. But you've also been a friend. I'm going to miss you. I didn't think it'd be so hard to say goodbye. It's been a real pleasure. You are the only person I have ever met who I didn't have to explain or even justify myself to. Perfectamundo. -Sorry about the trash. -Hmm. -Can I send you a postcard? -What for? Okay, I'll give you a ring, then. I've got your number. When will you ring me? Do you know, I think Vivienne would have liked our story. Well, she's not here to see it, is she? Right, then. I'm so sorry about your daughter. I'm off. Erm, I left something for you. It's in the freezer. Snow cake. Now that is interesting. Oh, no. And he's totally overwhelmed by how big the world is and how small and unimportant he is. And as he turns around, we see his face look to the sky, and he says, very quietly, so that no one can hear him... "Dazlious." Ripped by H20h
