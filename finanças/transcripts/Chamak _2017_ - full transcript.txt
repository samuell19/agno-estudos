'I want you guys to meet him, but he's abroad.' 'Come, let's go there.' "Dwapara Yuga ended Before Christ." "There lived someone, who stole butter." "Kali Yuga started After Christ."

Sir, you're not holding the hand of the baby's mother you're holding my sister's hand. Oh, I'm sorry.. You will become a mother someday, isn't it? Sir, for how long do we have to keep visiting the government hospital? I can't visit the holy river, Ganga, to wash away my sins. That is why, I come here.. - Okay. - ...to serve people. And on my way out, I wash my hands and face in the washbasin. Go. Ask the patient to come in. - Okay, sir. Sit down. What is the problem? We have been married for five years now, we don't have a child. We have visited all the temples and sincerely prayed to God. If visiting temples had helped, we would've been obsolete. Have you affectionately.. Ma'am, can you please step out for a minute? - Okay.. - Go out. What have you done for her out of love? Every year on her birthday I buy her a splendid Ilkal sari, 'Shenga Holige' and a cubit of flowers. I was talking about the intimacy between you both. Wow! You're blushing! - I kiss her once in a while. Hey! If you continue kissing her once in a while you will never have a baby. My assistant named Protein will help you with your problem. You shouldn't ingest that medicine, it's meant for your eyes. Okay, sir. - Go on. - Bye. I'll take your leave. Who's your wife among these three? All three of them are my wives. Oh, my God! You can go in. Where's the doctor's prescription? The doctor told me to not ingest the medicine he said, you would give a medicine meant for my eyes. For your eyes? Come with me. Are you sure it's for your eyes? - Yes. - Let's go.. Doctor, greetings. Well, what should I do if I don't want a child? Nothing. Don't do a thing. Doctor, she and I have already got intimate. What do I do now? Oh, is it? This will help as you have already done it. My assistant, Protein, is outside. He will give you the medicine. Go meet him. - Okay, Doctor. - Thank God. You can go in now. Let's go.. Should I take it before or after having food? After the intercourse. Hello? - We are about to leave for the girl's home. You are welcome to join us. Otherwise, you can meet her at the venue of the wedding. I'll be there. - Come soon. I should somehow ruin it. Welcome to Facebook family. Weird. I wonder what kind of people live here. Hello. Please login. Login? - I mean, come in. - Oh. Please come.. Regard this as your own account. Oh.. Wow! Write something on the wall. Why is it written, 'Write something on the wall', sir? Why are you wearing a name tag? You know, we are very friendly people. We like to socialise. We make friends wherever we go. - Oh. They shouldn't struggle to find us on social media. So, we are wearing our username as our name tag. Oh. - Tell me your username. I'll add you, right away. No, I'm not on Facebook. You don't have a Facebook account! Look, I don't mind if you don't have a bank account. But to become my son-in-law, you must have a Facebook account. Don't worry. Let's create an account for you. Come.. Take a seat. Would you like to know the Wi-Fi password? - No. No, thanks. I use a Jio SIM. Greetings. Sir, who is she? She's my eldest daughter, Princess Angel Priya. She had a fight with her husband as he liked other girls' photos. So, I brought her home. I don't understand as to what is going on. Mom, this is how people of the current generation interact. You won't get it. They have updated their knowledge unlike you, so be quiet. Kush, they are very rich. Please marry her. They can build a hospital for you and a yoga centre for me. Please agree to marry her. Who's she? She's my mother. Why is she laughing constantly? She's feeling happy, you see. - Oh. The thing is, a year ago, my dad permanently deactivated his account and he is with God now. My dad used to fight with my mom frequently. After my dad permanently deactivated his account my mom opened hers. And since then, she has been smiling all the time. Please call the girl. Thayamma. - No, I don't need coffee or tea. I didn't say, 'aayamma' I said, Thayamma, she's my second daughter. 'I finished a live session 10 minutes ago.' 'I'm live again. - Hi.. - Hi.' 'Look, my sister's holding two cups' 'with the logos of Facebook and Twitter on them.' 'There's a suitor at home to see her.' 'We are glad.' 'Back camera.' I need not ask her to smile. Even if I ask her to smile, she won't. Hi, Aunty. - Aunty! Get lost. These two aren't important. Suresh has a question. Who's the prospective bridegroom? Oh, Mr. Suresh, he's the prospective groom. Take a good look at him. Hi, I was told that he is my dad. Hey! I'm your dad. I was the one who sent the request. He's Thayamma's brother, my third child. He's not yet 13 years old. So, I've created a fake account for him to use. He live-streams everything that happens at home. He's very smart. You mean, everything? - Yes. - Yes, everything.. If you both want to chat in private you can go to the messenger lounge, it is upstairs. You can go there and chat in private. Go on.. Go talk to her. Go. Hey.. - Go. Be confident. Hello. - Hi. Why are your family members so obsessed with Facebook? I hope you are not like them. - No, I hate that. It's completely fake and it's a virtual life. I got bored with that. Actually, I was looking for a change. And I came across Instagram. By the way, are you on Instagram? - No. Twitter? - No. Hey, don't say like that. You are not on FB, either. No, I'm not.. I use 'Twinstabook'. 'Twinstabook'? - Yes. Is this a new app? I haven't heard about it. Yes, 'Twinstabook' is a new app. It runs only on 7G mobile phones. Okay? It is developed by a company named Dubak Technologies. At times, Facebook shows our memories, right? Likewise, 'Twinstabook' shows your future instead of past. That's how it works. - Really? So, two years ago, did you know that you're going to visit us? If I had known, I wouldn't have come here. What did you say? No, this app only helps you see the future. It's a very new app, that's why. What other feature has it got? It has everything. You know, using that app, you can do cooking, shopping and so on. Usually, when we shop online, they deliver clothes at home. It's hard to return them if the clothes don't fit you, right? But this app is different. You can just see, tap and shop. And you can literally take out the dress try it on, and put it back if it doesn't fit you. Same thing goes with food. You can place an order and taste the food, right there. If you don't like it, you can put it back. In fact, you can wash your hands using the screen, it's a great app. It seems fake. As if your family members aren't fake.. They are fake.. - I'll complain to my dad. Go ahead, Thayamma. 'This poison isn't fake. It's original.' 'No, it's fake.' 'If you keep saying this, I'll drink it up.' Mother-in-law, stop being obsessed with soap operas and think about your son's future. I don't know what he said to that girl in the morning. Her family has stopped liking my mom's posts. Son, have you even thought about your future? Mom, I want to be like Gadappa. I will kill you then. Sister-in-law, what's your problem? Why do you talk constantly about my marriage? What's for breakfast tomorrow? - I won't tell you. You aren't saying what breakfast you will prepare tomorrow. But you want me to discuss my future with you! I won't. I am going to cook 'Puliyogare'. Okay, I will come tomorrow morning and eat it. Hey! You think that I'm a decent person because I'm a doctor, right? You may think I will remain like this after my marriage. If you think so, then you are wrong. Let me be honest with you. I go to late night parties. I stay outside till late in the night. You name a habit, I have it. I have got too many friends. I'm not going to change my lifestyle after the wedding. I don't want these things to stop. If you agree to this, I will marry you. Do you agree? Okay. I have boyfriends, too. I attend late night parties, too. Are you okay with it? Do you booze? Hey.. Sir, looks like you're not going to drink today. - Why? Because you already look wretched. - You jerk! Sorry, sir, I'll get your regular brand. 'Consumption of alcohol is injurious to health.' What's wrong? - What's wrong? Kush, why do you look depressed? Why are you at the bar in the daytime? What happened? What else? My family is forcing me to get married. It's not a big deal. Procreation is our duty. Why don't you get married? You know, I want to get married, too. But.. What exactly is your problem? We need to answer a lot of questions. Who? What? Why? 'Why were you talking to her? Where were you?' 'Why did you arrive with her? Are you bored of me?' 'Why did you change the mobile pattern?' 'Why did you change the password?' 'Give it to me. You deleted the message, right?' 'Why did you smile at her just because she did?' If we try to defend that girl.. She will make a sarcastic remark.. 'Why should you drop her? Is she a cripple?' 'She has a phone, she will book a cab.' 'Why should only you drop her?' 'You don't deserve a family.' 'You ruined my life.' 'My dad had found a good groom. I married you and ruined my life.' They will say so. Do you want me to listen to all this? - Oh. That's why, I am scared of getting married. Who is that! How could you get scared when you're in a bar? Dude.. Dude.. - Oh, it's him, cheapskate. Hey.. Dude.. How come you're so early today? It's early morning. I came to have my breakfast. Dishes are too pricey out here. So, I've brought some food from the nearby eatery. Dude, what's the problem? What sort of a girl should I marry to ensure, my lifestyle stays the same.. We are discussing that. No matter whom we marry, our lifestyle will be ruined. No, I will explain. 'Dude and his wife.' 'Party animal..' 'Simple and innocent.. Party animal..' 'Party animal.. 'Simple and innocent..' Dear, Students.. If Mr. Kush and his wife are party animals they will start fighting like animals. This will not work out. Cancel! Yes. - Oh! If Mr. Kush is a simple man and his wife is a party animal.. Oh, my God! She will not spare you. This will also not work out. Cancel. - Cancel. If Mr. Kush is a party animal and his wife is a simple woman.. Dear, Students no woman in India will agree to this. So, this will also not work out. If Mr. Kush is a simple man and his wife is a simple woman.. If Mr. Kush is a simple man and his wife is a simple woman.. Life will become wonderful. This will work out. 99.9 out of 100. Innocent and simple? Listen, our friend's lifestyle and your theory do not match. What do we do now? Acting, dear. Acting! The snake doesn't raise its hood to bite others. It acts and raises its hood just to scare people. Similarly, we will also have to act. Otherwise, neither will we get married nor will our parents spare us. Hey, I have a question. - Tell me. What if something goes wrong? Mr. Kush, do we spill alcohol if it doesn't taste good? No! We mix some soft drink with it and drink it. Don't we continue drinking? That's it. That's it. Correct. This is my second question. Ask me, Mr. Kush. What if she finds out in future? If she finds out tell her that she has ruined your social life. - Okay. You started drinking alcohol due to lack of entertainment. Your life will be set if you put the blame on her. This is my last question. - Ask me, Mr. Kush. Who taught you to write Kannada? Why, Mr. Kush? It's correct. Did I make any spelling mistake? 'Dude and wife.. Party animal, innocent..' 'Hey!' Hey! Sir, bill. - It's okay. We did not order this. Give the bill only to Kush. Why have you given two receipts? This is that fat and dark man's bill. But he left. - Yes. Sir, he has not gone anywhere. He is sleeping right here. Kush, I forgot to get my vehicle in a hurry. Drop me home. - Okay. You're my dear friend, Kush. Hey, both of you have not worn helmets. You will have to pay the fine. I will join you guys. - Come. Kush. - Yes? You have to pay a fine if three people travel by a bike. All four of us can go. Hey, how can four people sit on a bike? Hey! - Hey! - Hey! "People from Karnataka come together.." "People from Karnataka come together.." "Come." "Come." "Come." Hey, get down. Hit them. Sir, why are you standing with a stick? I'm standing with a stick because I know that boys like you will come drunk. Oh! - Oh! Rhyme! - Rhyme! Hey, what are they doing? - Rhyme! Hey! - Rhyme! Shut up! Who among you is employed? Hail Kush, the hardworking employed person. - Hail! Hail Kush, the hardworking employed person. - Hail! Keep quiet. What do you do? - I am a woman's doctor. Why are you fumbling? Say it in Kannada. Sir, he speaks Kannada fluently only when he is drunk. He said that he is a gynaecologist. Even in this era there are people like you who speak Kannada fluently. Please come and pay the fine. Sir! - Sir! - What is it? Inspector, we would have stayed back in the bar if we had money. Why would we have come here? Sir, they say that they don't have money. I thought of drinking German wine costing Rs. 25,000 for Rs. 5,000. They say that they don't have money. Let them go, sir. Hey, keep quiet. They will definitely have money. They would have hidden Rs. 5,000 somewhere. They will pay the fine. Keep quiet. Okay, sir. - Oh, no! Sir, does German wine cost only Rs. 5,000? Hey, I'll give you Rs. 10,000. - Hey! Take this, sir. - Hey! Take it. You have money for wine but not to pay the fine. Put it here, sir. - Take this. You have paid the fine. Hail drunkard Kush. - Hail.. Hey.. - Pal! - Why did you do that? I'll ruin my life if I be with you guys. I have to become a married man very soon. I am going to meet a girl tomorrow. My lifestyle and dressing style will change from tomorrow. Oh, salesman! There's a function in our house. Come later. Sir, I am not a salesman. I am Dr. Kush. - Oh! Sorry. Please come. Come inside.. Hey, don't touch my feet. I'm shocked to see my son behaving like this! - Don't be so formal. My mom has taught me to touch the feet of my elders and seek their blessings. - Oh. He has never followed my instructions. I wonder when he learned this. Mother-in-law, I think, he has come up with some plan. All of you be ready to escape. Brother, sit over here. I am scared. I'll sit next to our mom. - We are scared looking at your behaviour. I'm nervous. Everyone is here. Shall I call the girl? Kushi. Oh, my God! He sneezed once. Sneezing once is a good omen according to our culture. Your dad had sneezed just once when he had come to see me. - Oh. Serve it, Kushi. Your son, Kush, is not looking at my daughter, Kushi. Kush, see the girl once. Did you see her, Mom? - I saw her. Do you like her? - I liked her. If you've liked her, then I approve of her, too. My dear son! You love me a lot. Look at the girl once. Don't put on an act. Okay. He gave his consent. In that case, let your son, Kush, talk to my daughter. - Oh, no! No need.. He has seen her. That's sufficient.. No.. My mom said, I shouldn't talk to your daughter, so, I won't.. Hey.. How could you say that? They belong to the current generation. Let him talk to the girl. Mom, we shouldn't disobey our elders, right? I'll talk to her for a while. I forgot to ask your name. - Kushi. My name is Kush. - I know. My grandma told me. W-What is your qualification? I'm staying at home after completing my MBA. MBA. This means, you won't step out of the house. What did you say? Haven't you gone out of the house? No, I was brought up in Bengaluru. I studied there, too. I want to live in Bengaluru after I get married. So, I want to stay at home till I get married. Do you have any bad habits? Bad habits? I bite my nails. I don't have food on time. I work night shifts. So, I don't sleep on time. Do you have a boyfriend? No.. Shall we go out before we get married? We can spend some personal time. We can get to know each other. No, please. We'll go to Dharmasthala, Kukke Subramanya Kollur and Anegudde Temple after our wedding. We can talk then. Okay. - 'People like us try to fool' 'and people like her get fooled.' 'Such people are the reason for everyone's survival.' Does your family comprise of only these people? No, I have an uncle. - Oh, is it? What does he do? He took a break of one year to study for IAS exam It has been 10 years now. We found out after 10 years What does he do now? 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Sir, you are smoking too many cigarettes. It's not good for your health. If I do not smoke young boys will smoke and ruin their health. That is why I am smoking all the cigarettes. You are a great man, sir. Sir, won't this affect your health? I don't care if anything happens to me. But people should be able to walk on the streets comfortably. Sir, what is the connection between the two? Our spongelike lungs are limited only to breathing in fresh air. But when the lungs of people who smoke are squeezed you will find large traces of tar. And this tar can be used to repair the roads. And these roads will help many people to walk. - Sir. Look at that, sir. A blind woman is struggling to cross the road. - Hey.. Poor woman. Oh, blind lady! I have to save her. Hey! Stop. Ma'am. - Who is it? Wait.. - Why do you cross the road alone? Come slowly. I.. - Stop. Can't you see that she is blind? Poor woman! Idiot! No, sir. - Come, ma'am. Come. - The thing is.. - Look. There's a footpath. Take rest here. You cannot see. You should have taken the help of the public while crossing the road. Don't cross the road alone. Go. - Sir. Where is your cheek, sir? - Cheek? Oh, my God! You cannot kiss me in a public place. Give me your address. I'll come there. Go now.. Will you hold this for a minute? - Why, ma'am? Oh, no.. Hold it. - Hey! Oh, no.. You figured it out! Yes, that's my cheek! Naughty girl. Come on, give it now. Nobody will get to know. Give it. Oh, no! - What happened? So many people gathered so soon. Nobody had come when I went to ask for votes. What happened? Sir, I had crossed half the road with great difficulty. He brought me back to the place where I started from. Moreover, he touched me while talking. Ask him, sir. - Oh, my God! This lady is insulting a social worker. Did I try to touch you? What are you saying? If I'd wanted to touch somebody look, I would've hugged this woman. - Oh, no! Let go! Should I hug you? Look how beautiful she is. I'll sing a duet with her. Why would I touch you? Don't talk nonsense. - What is he doing.. Hey, he is dragging me around in front of you. Why are you quiet? Oh, no! - Such people should not be spared. Oh, no.. - Hit him! - Oh, God! We'll take your leave, ma'am. We'll take your leave, sir. Okay. - We'll leave. - It's a long journey. Go carefully. - Oh, no, sir. Travelling to Bengaluru from Mysore is not a big deal. We'll reach our city in a short while. Uncle, what happened? - Nothing, Kushi. It was a petty fight. Somebody was teasing a girl. I hit him. His henchmen gathered. We fought! I sent the injured people to the emergency ward and I sent the corpses to the mortuary. Ladies, too.. - Who is he? You don't worry. Nothing has happened to me. He is my wife's brother. She had brought him along when she came here. But she left him here when she died. I don't know when he'll leave us. - Oh! The women hugged me after they were impressed by my fight. Sir, if you are in this condition after hitting them what is the condition of the people who got beaten up? Hey, who are you? I have come to see Kushi, sir. Kushi? How dare you say that in front of me? Hey, scoundrel! I just fought like Tiger Prabhakar. Don't spoil my mood. Go from here. The groom's family will be arriving. Go, get out! Uncle, he is the groom. Oh, my God! Is he the groom? He is good looking. She blushed while saying so so, it means, the wedding is fixed. "This is a sacred thread" "which is essential for my long life." "I will tie this around your neck." "May you live happily ever after with me." "This is a sacred thread" "which is essential for my long life." "I will tie this around your neck." "May you live happily ever after with me." "This is an auspicious thread" "which is essential for a long life." "I will tie this around your neck." "May you live happily ever after with me." Kush. - Father-in-law. I'm gifting you a house. - A house? I'm gifting this out of affection. Take this. All the best. - Thanks. Start your new life in your new house. - Thanks, Dad. Bless me. - It's okay. It's okay. God bless you. Kushi, that house is registered in your name. Okay, Dad. Oh, I thought that you brought the milk. No, I didn't. My grandma said that she would get it. All right. She turned off the light. Actually.. I thought, you turned off the light. No.. Actually, there was a power outage, it has been restored now. Oh. All right, I'll wear my shirt. You don't have to.. I'll turn off the light. I'll close that door. Please take this.. I wanted to give it to you on your wedding day. If you get very angry.. There's a recorder in it. Turn it on and vent out all your frustration in front of it. Once you're satisfied, listen to it. If you feel that whatever you'd said was right then you can go scold her badly. - Okay. Look, she mustn't know that I've given this to you. He mustn't know that I've given this to you. Okay. - All right, Grandma. Good morning! Oh! - Coffee. Why did you take the trouble? Give me five minutes, I'll prepare breakfast for you. Hey.. No need.. The patients would have come to the hospital. I need to go immediately. Please have it. At least, if you tell me what you want I'll prepare it. Yes. Yes. I'll note down whatever I want for a week.. We'll continue the same if this works. Otherwise, we'll change it, okay? I'll paste it here. Okay? Take this. I'll leave. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. 'He has scribbled as if this is a prescription!' I'll be there only on Thursdays. Hereafter, come here. Hampa. - Yes, sir. The medicine has worked very well. Don't go anywhere else and do anything. Okay. It's doctors like me who give good news to all the parents in the world. Congratulations! Your wife is pregnant. Hampa. - Yes, sir. I'll prescribe the medicines. The medicines must be taken on time. - Okay, sir. She needs to have food on time. Don't take any stress. You shouldn't get her worked up. - No, sir, I won't. When are you giving me a treat? I'll do it very soon, sir. My wife prepares tasty 'Holige', sir. Once she delivers the baby I'll get her to prepare 'Shenga Holige' especially for you and bring it. - Okay. Will you get it? - Sure, sir. We'll take your leave. Protein! - Yes, sir? Don't take any money from them for the medicines. Okay, sir. - Okay? It looks proper now. I went to a pharmacy, today. - Why? What happened? I didn't understand what you wrote on the prescription. Poor fellow! Even he didn't understand it. Somehow, I decoded it.. - Oh. - ...and prepared the food. Superb! It tastes great. How did you learn to cook so well? Cooking is a form of art. Cooking is done using a few ingredients. The person who cooks brings them to life. The people who relish those dishes make those efforts worthwhile. I was at home after completing my MBA, right? So, I learned cooking during my free time. What styles of cooking do you know? North Indian, South Indian, Mexican, Italian. I'll prepare whatever you want. What do you know to cook in South Indian cuisine? Idli, Vada, Puri, Pongal, 'Set Dosa' 'Masala Dosa', 'Plain Dosa', 'Bisi bele bhath' and 'Puliyogare'. 'Puliyogare'! Which North Indian dishes do you know to cook? I'm famous for cooking North Indian dishes well. Is that so? Roti, 'Naan', 'Butter Naan', 'Dal Khichri', Kulcha 'Palak Paneer', 'Palak Butter Masala' 'Palak Tikka Masala' and Biryani. Wow! Superb! One moment. Hello? - Hello, Kush, it's an emergency where are you? I'm at home. All right, come to our regular hang out place soon. Okay.. What happened? There's a problem. My friend has met with an accident and he has been hospitalised. I have to go and pay the bill. Is it? - Yes. You look so relaxed! I'm a doctor, right? - Oh! I'll take some Biryani. - Please take it.. Poor fellows! I don't know if they've had any food after he met with an accident, as they were upset. Probably, they'll need some food. I'll pack the food for you. - It's okay. Biryani! Superb, pal. Hey, get some plates. Hey, forget it! He wants plates! I want the chicken drumstick. - Please have it.. - Hey. I want this! Who prepared this Biryani? It's delicious! My wife. It's superb! - It's amazing, pal. - Hey! Hey, I didn't keep any Biryani for her. Please have it.. - You did a good thing. Who the heck is he! It has been an hour since I placed an order for Biryani. Why didn't you give it till now? - Why is he.. Cancel the order! - Cancel the Biryani. You idiot! It's him.. Eat it.. Hey.. - Pal.. Pal, how is life after marriage? Pal, how was your wedding night? Super! Do you know what happened? What happened, pal.. Invite me on your wedding night if you don't know what to do, I'll teach you, right there. You.. Pal, tell me something about Ms. Kushi. Ms. Kushi! She has the face of an angel and an angel-like disposition. She speaks very naively. - Okay. She's very good at cooking. - Oh. I feel very guilty. Why? I feel that I'm deceiving a good girl. Is that so? But it's okay. I'll take good care of her. Pal. - Yes. - You don't know who I am and you take good care of me. So, you'll obviously take good care of your wife. Isn't it? Friends! - Yes? - Goodnight! Goodnight.. Pal! - Hey.. - Hey.. Oh! Oh.. What happened? I was keeping back the oil dispenser. What! I slipped. So I was keeping it back. You slipped because of the oil and I slipped because I am intoxicated. What do you mean? Drat! What's this? I can smell liquor. Where is this stink emanating from? Do you smell alcohol? Yes.. Oh, okay. Actually, there's a bachelors' party happening at our neighbour's house. So, that could be the cause. Drunkards! By the way, how are your friends? What! - Your friends? They are out of danger but they are unconscious! Thank God! Tomorrow is Saturday. I have work in the hospital, tomorrow night. Oh, is it? - Yes. 'She believed me.' I'll be working at the hospital every weekend. Please support me. It's okay. I understand your problem. Actually, it's too late. Shall we go to bed? Sure.. Okay, bye. - Bye. Oh! - No.. It's okay. - Bye. Oh! Thank you. I'd forgotten it. Kush! - Yes? Oh, yes.. You'll return soon tomorrow morning, right? I'll come back in the morning. If the number increases, then I'll come at noon, okay? What? - Operations.. - Oh! Bye. - Bye. Kush, how are you? You got married recently. - Oh! Did I see her at the wedding or not.. Ms. Savithri I sincerely thank you for attending my wedding because I invited you. Hey, don't tease me! I tried my best to attend it, but I couldn't make it. I'm so sorry. I told you that I'd be going to Canada on a trip, right? Yes. - Even you should have come. It was so amazing! You could have got married later. It's okay. I'll show you the pictures. Hey, show it to me if there are some good girls in it. Don't show it to me if you're in it. You haven't mended your ways even after getting married, right? Wait! Here it is. Take a look at it. Oh! We enjoyed so much there. Do you know that? Hey, this is.. I.. Oh.. - This is Kushi's pre-wedding party. See the next picture. Tell me who she is. Oh, this girl? - Yes. She's an amazing girl! 'Bomb..' Oh, God! May I have a glass of vodka, please? Tell me something about her. - Okay. She hails from Mysore. She has started an event management business in Bangalore. She behaves very decently when she is in Mysore. But when she's here, she behaves differently. She's very independent. She goes on solo bike rides. She used to drive away the boys who would come to meet her with a proposal. Go and reject the proposal, decently. Otherwise, I'll become very violent. She's slightly arrogant. Basically, she's behaving the way you would have had you been a girl. Hi, guys! Are you guys having fun? - Hi, baby! - Hi! I missed you! - Hi.. - What's up? Dear, is it that difficult to meet me even once after getting married? No! - Is it because your husband can't stay without you? Hey, baby! Where's your husband? Oh, no! I think, it's him! - Oh, my God! Hey, wait.. Don't panic. First, hide the liquor bottles. And then, we'll hide. Hey, hold this! Go and hide, all of you. Oh, my God! I think, I'm unlucky, today. Oh, God! Okay. Who's there? It's you! - Hey, baby. - Oh, dear! Come inside. - I missed you so much. You freaked me out! I'm sorry! - Hey! Hey, nice interiors! Kush! - Kush! Where is he.. Kush.. - I think, Kush is here. Is that Kush? Yes, that's Kush. Kush! - I think, she's giving us a hint. Wait! How do you know him? Forget about that. You're next to him in the photo. Won't your husband say anything? He won't say anything. He's a very cool guy. What do you mean? Why should I display someone else's photo? He's my husband. Him? - Yes. Is he your husband? - Yes. You said that he is very decent and innocent. Yes, that's him. You're mistaken! Last time, when I came from US to see my sister's baby I went to a party with him. You're confused. He's not that sort of guy. He's innocent. - You don't trust me, right? - No. - Wait. I'll make him say that by himself. Kush.. - What! - Be alert. I think, he's attacking her. Oh, my! I beg of you! He works night shifts on Saturdays. He's not at home, dear. Holy mother of God! It's Saturday night and I don't know at which party he is boozing. He has fooled you. Look at yourself. Take this.. - Take it.. Be ready.. You still don't believe me, right? Wait. I'll show it to you. I think, he beat her. Come on, friends, let's save her. - We shouldn't let.. - Hey.. Hey.. We won't spare you. Guys! What.. What's happening? - Oh, my God! 'Thrash him with a broom, all of you.' 'They've increased the price from Rs. 20 to Rs. 70.' 'What do we do for our livelihood?' 'It's Rs. 70 now. It was Rs. 30..' It's Rs. 70 now. What do we do for our livelihood?' 'We are poor people. What do we do?' 'Hey, your party' 'and their party has broken the promises, too.' 'How can you say that we deceived you all? 'We did it in a proper manner.' 'How can you say that?' 'You all pretended and did it without anyone's knowledge' 'so, it is deemed cheating.' 'Hold on..' 'Look, the fraudulent acts you both committed have been exposed' 'even then, you're not ready to accept it.' 'So, the situation is very tense.' - Oh. 'If anyone accuses our party' 'then we'll set everything on fire.' 'We won't spare anything.' 'We won't spare anything.' 'We managed to instigate both of you.' 'All right, let's move ahead.' 'Why should we go ahead? We'll go backward.' 'I know that you betrayed me.' 'I'll definitely drink some poison.' Why don't you just drink it and die.. 'Return to your mom's place.' 'Vishagamini has picked up the bottle of poison' 'for the 17th time.' 'See whether she will drink it or not in the next part.' 'Is there no peace in your family?' 'Is there discord between husband and wife?' 'Do you have court cases?' 'You want to cast a spell on a woman or a man?' 'Casting a spell on both..' 'For all kind of problems, we assure to give' 'permanent solution in just 11 days.' 'His Holiness Pandit Parihara, has come from Meghalaya' 'as his followers insisted..' 'He will be residing in room number 420' 'of Kanishka Lodge in Majestic.' 'Offer! Raining offer!' 'Advocate Vichedhan Kumar, divorce specialist.'

"My wife is a haughty lady." "Keep playing pranks on her to teach a lesson." "Teach her a lesson.." Get lost! - You get lost! Hey, Kush, what are you saying? Yes, friends. I reformed for Kushi's sake. But it was in vain. If I get to lay my hands on the guy who gave this idea.. - Hey! Hey, who is that? Who is breaking bottles whilst boozing? Mr. Kush, it's you! Mr. Kush, won't your wife get to know that you booze if you go home drunk like this? You have a solution to even this issue, right? Yes. - Then come and tell me. - I'm coming. Come, come. I'm coming. Darn. Tell me, mister, what is your problem? Oh, is this the problem? Oh, no.. Oh, God! You stabbed my fritter! How could you be so bitter! My snack! My titbit! Not a titbit.. - Oh, no! - That was your thigh! - Oh, no! Not my thigh, you stabbed the Vada.. Since food is expensive here I had got Vadas from outside. You ruined all of them. It's better that you have them. Kushi, enough. You are drunk. Sleep here tonight. If you go home, then Kush will get to know. I am getting drunk so that he gets to know. What! Kushi, are you mad? Even he is pretending like me. He is not what he appears to be. I used to say that I work a night shift every Saturday and fool everyone but he fooled me! Is it true, Mr. Kush? - Yes. Even she listened to the advice of some scoundrel like you and put on an act. So, your wife is a modern girl in the garb of an orthodox girl. What kind of a wife is she! - Oh, God! They say if we escape a bad situation, we are lucky. But I got myself into trouble by marrying her. It's okay. Chill. What do you mean? I should thrash you, first. I used to somehow manage to threaten all the guys who used to come with a proposal and chase them away. It was you who told me to marry some naive guy that too, a doctor. Isn't it? You were the ones who had said that he will be busy with his own life, his hospital and his work. But.. - But knowingly, I won't let that happen now. I don't care what happens.. I will put an end to all this, today. I might even thrash him. I had made so many plans pertaining to my life but that rogue ruined everything. Look, guys, if there was some minor problem with her then I'd have tried to rectify it. But in my case, she herself is a problem So, I'll get rid of her itself! It must be him. I'll teach him a proper lesson now. 'You are drunk, right?' 'You guys solve your problems on your own.' 'Why do you people always call us?' 'Don't you have guts?' 'Disgusting.' 'Whether people do it or not' 'but God definitely plays cruel jokes on everyone.' 'Famine and other natural calamities happen' 'because of people like her.' Someone here is drunk. - Yes. It is me. What are you going to do? My foot! You called me here saying that you want to discuss something. What is it? The thing is.. - No, no, wait. Ladies first. So, I'll speak. You don't look like a doctor! You look like a rogue. Hey! You have called me here to discuss something then speak to me politely. I won't tolerate it if you speak rudely. I'll give you one tight slap. I am a doctor only by profession. Once upon a time, I was a terror! A terror! - Sir.. Sir, please don't do anything to me, sir. I am the only daughter to my parents. Please, sir. God! Please, God! Sir.. Sir, don't do anything to me, sir. Hey, wretched woman! - Hey! Hey! Wretched woman! When we had come to your house your grandma sneezed once and said it is a good omen we should've realised then that yours is not an ordinary family but is a big drama troupe which is full of liars. I had assumed that you are like Lady Sita wife of Lord Rama. But, no, you are like Shurpanakha! And your uncle is not a brave man like Tiger Prabhakar he is a coward. Your father is like the character in the movie 'Bahubali'.. - Katappa. No, he is a sly cat! A bad dad! A bad dad. - This is what.. This is what always happens. We have started dominating over each other. I won't accept defeat and you won't stop having an upper hand. So.. - So, what? Divorce! Yes. Shall we celebrate our decision to divorce? - Sure. Hey, where are you going? To get liquor. I already have it here. Yes. Let me go and get it. - Okay. It is already at home! Wonderful! You meant this? 'What happened?' 'I was keeping the bottle of oil back.' Hey. Oil and alcohol sound similar. Why didn't I ask her clearly? I got confused. I am ready. "I have signed the divorce papers.." "I have signed the divorce papers.." Won't it affect your liver if you drink it neat? No. I am drinking it neat because I want to forget about you. Darn you! I will drink it neat to forget about him. Cheers! Happy break-up day! If we fight and leave this house.. They will reunite us by assuming that it's normal to have fights in a marriage. So, we need to handle it cleverly. What do we do apart from complaining about each other? I have a masterplan. I have a better plan. Come, dear. What's wrong? Are you crying? Oh, my God! Yes, she's crying! I know you're crying. I got it. If you keep crying like this, what do I make of it? Tell me. What is the matter? I.. I won't live with Kush anymore. If you live with someone else, will Kush agree? - Hey! Be quiet! - Oh, no.. - You always speak inappropriately! Tell me. What's the matter? You bought us a home so that Kush and I can live happily, right? But his brother wants to have a good time with me. - Let him. I gifted you the house and got you married because I wanted everyone to be happy. Dad, you don't understand. He misbehaves with me when Kush isn't around. I told Kush about this. But he did not believe me. So, I came here. I knew it! - What! I wanted to tell you. - What? 'Welcome..' 'Welcome..' 'Hey, naughty guy.. - Sir..' 'Why are you hugging everyone?' 'I like this concept. - What?' 'But I don't get it.' 'Well, if we welcome women by giving a handshake' 'we get to touch their hand, only.' 'But if you hug them..' 'You can touch their body! - No.' 'It feels more personal.' 'You!' 'I feel like hugging only you!' - Hey, careful! Thank you.' So, what are you planning to do? - Isn't it obvious? She has to get a divorce. - Hey, fool! Shut up! I meant, Kush needs to sever his ties with his brother. Hey, shut up! Why have you come alone? Didn't Kushi come? Mom, Kushi said, she'd come.. - Yes. But her uncle said, he'd come along. Let him come. I have got them to make Fish Curry. He could've had it and gone. Mom, forget about that. I didn't want to be his target. So, I managed to escape. Please speak clearly. Mom, it's time for a flashback. Keep your eyes on my finger.. 'Kushi, can you scrub my back?' "Oh, handsome man.. Lovely lass.." "Let's play 'Kolata'. - Let's play 'Kolata'.." "Oh, handsome man.. Whose.." Hey! If that was the case, you should have ousted him. I asked Kushi to oust him. - Yes. But she did not believe me. She said that the house was gifted by her father. So, I came to my father's house. Okay, dear. Come. Hey! Hi! What happened to you, Kushi? My dad said that you are very depressed. Oh, no! Forget about that. You brought a Pizza, right? - Yes, I have. Yes! So, this is what happened. So, when will you divorce him? He said, he'd take care of it. Oh, by the way, why did you come here? Tell me. I had told you that I've to attend my friend's pre-wedding party. Do you remember? - Yes. So, I don't want to go by myself. I will be bored. I came to ask you whether you'll accompany me. I am a party girl. Why are you asking me? Obviously, I'll come. Okay. All right, I'll take your leave now. Wait, even I will come downstairs. Dhinchak Pooja's new song is going to be released soon. I am just waiting for it. I can't wait.. Pooja, when did you come? Come, eat with us. - I already had food at home. Kushi. - Yes. Come on, eat. - No, Dad. I'm not in the mood. Why, dear? How can you starve just because you're upset? You will fall sick if you don't eat. I won't eat, if you don't. Hey.. Pass me the bowl.. Isn't there any food, Sister-in-law? I am used to cooking for three people. We have run out of food. I don't understand why you're here. Wait for five minutes. I will cook rice for you. No need.. You have said all this.. Why should you cook now? 'If such things happen, I will drink poison! - What!' 'Due to some reasons' 'a new actor will be playing the role of her husband.' 'We request the old viewers to accept him in this role.' Oh, no! It's 5:30 p.m.! The daily soap, 'Mane Ondhu, Mooru Visha' has started. A sister-in-law is like a mother. But she can't take the place of a mother. Apart from a mother only a wife will take care of you. Are you feeling bad because you're facing such problems in your life? Not really. - What? She was supposed to drink poison before my wedding and she hasn't done it yet. If I find her, I will force her to drink it. 'No, no one can find me or get me!' I will ask Kush, whether he is free. Kush, are you free? Yes, I am free. Give me a massage. Hey! He is not feeling well. So you can go with Rakesh, Meghna. Mom, I have some work. I'll be back. 'I will consume poison!' - Meghna! I am on the way. I'll be there by the time you get ready. Okay? Bye.. Whom were you talking to? Mom, I will have dinner outside, tonight. Sister-in-law, please cook only for three people. Okay? Who else? He was talking to your sister. You look great in this red dress. - I know. All guys say this.. So, say something new. - Hello. Hi.. Hey, Kush. - Yes. That's the wedding couple, Pavana and Arjun. People who lied a lot are married.. - Hi! - ...and happy. But my life is ruined because of a few lies. What did you say? I am looking for the bar counter. It's over there.. - Bar! I will be there.. You carry on. - Kush! Yes.. Hey, boys and girls, hit the dance floor! Hey, Kushi. - Yes. Let's dance. - Okay.. - No.. She's married. - Oh, I forgot, Kushi. I am sorry.. - Let's dance. Come, let's dance. - Yes, sure. - Yes. Come, we'll go. Let's have fun. 'What is the connection between dance and one's marital status? I spent fuel and brought her here and she's dancing with someone else. I spent my fuel. Won't anyone value that? Raj.. Kush.. Hey, what's going on? Meghna! - Hey! Oh.. Kush.. - Yes. You are high and moreover you are married. Carry on. Oh, shit! Hey.. There's some girl standing alone over there. Let me try luring her. If a woman looks attractive from behind then she would make a great life partner, it seems. No matter where I go, I meet her! Darn my luck! Greetings. Hi! What brings you here? I was looking for fishes in the pool. - Oh. What about you? I was looking for pearls at the bottom of the pool. Oh, don't stoop so low. Go to the backyard. You will find what you want, there. I'm not that desperate. How are you? - I am good. How about you? - I am fine. My family is upset because I am upset. Kushi.. Do we have to remain like this for the sake of our happiness? - Oh.. Even you're facing the same problem at your house, is it? - Yes. Both my mother and brother are not very happy at home. My sister-in-law doesn't serve me food. Even I'm facing the same problem. They do serve the food on their plates and then, they just get up without having it. You don't need me. I don't need you. - True. But our family wants the two of us to be together. Why don't we.. - Be friends? Yes. - Isn't it? I won't impose restrictions on you neither will you impose restrictions on me. We could actually be together. Till we get separated. - Of course. We couldn't be a good couple. But I bet, we'll be really good friends. Yes.. - Trust me, it'll be fun. Yes. What next? Let's begin part two. 'He's so shameless. He has come here and he is sitting over here.' 'This rascal is still after my brother.' Please stop fighting over these trivial issues, hereafter. No matter what the reason could be this generation is.. - Ma'am, listen. You are quite old. It's these silly matters that lead to a fight these days. Just try marrying once again. You will wish to get separated from grandpa. Everyone is well-educated these days but they don't know the traditional values. Fool! Do you know why three knots are tied while tying the nuptial chain? So that it stays intact. Why do they take the seven circumambulations? That's because their feet would have got numb by sitting in the same place. So they're sent for a walk. Do you know why they're shown the star, Alcor? I know. It would be a nice pose for the photo and they can get a lot of likes on Facebook. - Hey! Wrong. I know the answer for this. The star, Alcor, will be revolving around the star, Mizar. The two stars safeguard each other. Similarly, a husband should safeguard his wife and vice versa. And that's why, the star, Alcor, is shown. Am I right, Grandma? You have enlightened me. Hereafter, I will always safeguard my wife. 'After having promised to safeguard me' 'he's looking at other women.' Kush. - Yes. I'll just go to the washroom and come back. Sure. Token number, 19. I repeat, token number, 19. Hey, I'm coming. Why do you want to divorce her? Don't you like her? Why not? She's beautiful. Why are you applying for the divorce then? I don't need it. - What! Sir, he's not my husband. - Just stop it, ma'am. I should be saying this after getting you divorced. Sir, he was never married to me. What! So? Are you planning to marry after getting divorced? Sir, I swear, I don't know who he is. What! What's your name? - Priyanka. And yours? - Gandhi. - What? I'm Kush. - Just give me your token. And yours, ma'am. Sir, it's not your turn. Your token number is 61 and hers is 19. Come only when your number is called. Take this back. Token number 19? Hurry up, mister. Had you delayed further your wife and I would have got divorced. Hurry up.. Token number 61. Your name? - Dr. Kush. With whom have you come this time? She's my wife. - Why do you want a divorce? I don't like her. Ma'am, he's quite jovial with the others except you. Is that how he is? - Yes, sir. You've been married just for two months. What's the reason that you want to get divorced? My wife and I don't have a good understanding. We're applying for the divorce so that we don't have any misunderstanding in future. That's it, sir. That's not a valid reason, sir. You should be married at least for an year except for some exempted cases. - And what are they? Like dowry harassment, impotency or mental illness. Sir, I'm a gynaecologist. I will give you a certificate asserting that she can't conceive. Oh, yes. - Excuse me. Sir. I will file a dowry harassment case instead. Fine. Okay.. Try! Just come with me! - What! I meant, come, let's go outside. Let's have a discussion. Just a second. Sir, as of now, let's file a case that he's impotent. So, are you ready to accept it in the court that you're impotent? Yes. Sir, I hope the matter will be kept confidential. Only you, me, your wife and the court will know this. No one apart from the four of us will know. - Okay. But it's your responsibility to ensure, no one in your family reads the notice sent from the court. I'll take care of that, sir. - Do that. No one else will get to know, is it? I doubt if he can get us divorced. Excuse me. I didn't have any case in 2001. To keep my practice going I filed a case against my wife and I even won the case. Really, sir? - Yes. Congratulations, sir. - Thank you.. 'Thank God you're not a gynaecologist.' 'To keep your practice going' 'I guess you'd have helped random women give birth.' 'I have to plead with Kush now to get my work done.' 'I wonder if he will come or not.' Hello. - Hello. Kush, my car broke down. - Where? I was returning home from an event. Let me tell you the exact location I'm near Avinashi hoarding in Hesaraghatta. I'm very scared. Kush, please come and pick me up. Why don't you book a cab and come? I'm not finding any cab here. Had I found it, I would have booked it. Is it so? - Yes. Fine. I'm coming. - Okay.. Oh! - Oh! It's me. - Oh, God! Hey! Why? What's wrong with you? - It's midnight.. - Yes. I'm all alone. Eve-teasers will trouble me. So, for my self-defence.. Come. - What about my car? I'll get it towed. - Oh, fine. I didn't get scared. - Okay.. As if.. Of course. - Yes. Oh. What event you had to manage at this hour? Earlier, there were joint families and there would be enough people at home. Each one of them would take up some responsibility. Whereas, these days, it's just the parents and children. We have to get everything done right from finding the bride. Oh, is that so? - Yes. - What about the wedding night? What? They have to plan it themselves. I want to attend one of your events. Actually, we have a Holi event coming up next week. - Oh.. We're organising it very grandly. Actually, even you can come. I will come. Hey.. This is the third time we're doing it and we've organised it quite grandly this time. Actually, all this.. Hi! Abhi, that's too much. Is he your friend? - Yes. What happened? - Deepa, we had fired some bouncers last time, right? They're here again. Why did they come here? I really don't know. - Hey.. - Hey! Kush.. Happy Holi! Don't worry. He's alone, both of us can handle him. Do you know to fight? Actually, almost 15 of them are here. Holy shit! You know all of them? - Yes. So, put saffron colour on each of their faces, okay? - Hey.. Wow.. Okay. Hey.. So, it's you? Come on. Come.. - Come.. Come on! Come.. Hey.. Happy Holi.. Kush, thank you for saving my event. I didn't beat them up to save the event. Scoundrels! How dare they tease my wife? Shall I leave? Excuse me. - Hey.. Kushi, your husband is not just an expert surgeon he has expertise in surgical strike as well. By the way, please don't mind me saying this. You know that I had a love marriage. After the wedding, my boyfriend became a typical husband. On the contrary, in your case, you got a husband and now he's turned into a friend. What more do you want? 'Scoundrels! How dare they tease my wife?' "He has barged into my heart and there's a war going on here." "I'm losing control over myself and falling in love with him." "The blowing wind tickles me.' "My heart is like blossoms that sway in love." "I have started dreaming about you." "I think, I'm in love." "I turn my gaze downwards, I've learned how to blush" "I blush scarlet and adorn my hair with magnolia." "He has barged into my heart.." Are you counting the whistle? - No, I'm not. Why? If we don't switch it off after three whistles, it will blast. Stop joking. How do you know that? Hey, I'm not joking, I swear. I've witnessed it blast when I was a kid. Then switch it off now. Run.. He came back home in the evening. "She has barged into my heart, and there's a war going on here." "The lines between love and friendship blur.." "Why is this happening?" "You're my love. You're my victory." I'm sorry, Doctor. I know you're quite tired after performing many operations. We had to call you because it's an emergency. Thanks a lot, ma'am. - No problem. Happy birthday, Kushi. How did you know? If a girl receives too many calls and messages at midnight it means, it is her birthday, right? Once again, happy birthday. - Smart. You seem sad. - No.. Kushi, I'll be right back. - Okay. For the angel. Happy birthday! Cake. Do you know what I am going to gift you? Yes! - What? You like to travel, don't you? "Shyness has become my speech, and there's a rhythm in my walk." "I think, I know you inside out now." "Oh, Poet, I'm blushing scarlet because of you." "You are like a pristine bloom. You are like a delicate creeper." "When you walk along" "I forget the path and enjoy the journey." "He has barged into my heart, and there's a war going on here." "I'm losing control over myself and falling in love with him." "The blowing wind tickles me.' "My heart is like blossoms that sway in love." "I have started dreaming about you.." "Your beauty is enthralling, it draws me close to you" "it's pretty addictive.." "She has barged into my heart.." "You are my love.. - Love.." "You are my victory.. - Victory.." "You are like the blue waves.. You're my path. - Waves.." "You are like the ocean.. You're my destination. - Ocean.." Sir, here's your food. This local booze is too mild. Sir, for this weather, you shouldn't be drinking beer. I have some fine grass. Shall I get it? Where will you keep it? - Here. Go ahead. What grass is it, anyway? Dried grass, I guess. It will help you slip into deep sleep. They won't be awakened even if there's a tsunami. Hey. - Yes. You're intoxicating and quite devious. Girls can be compared to cotton.. If it's placed inside ears, it's winter time. If it is placed inside the nostrils, someone's time's up. If it is made into a wick, it brightens homes. I have a headache. I'm quite sleepy, too. The room is very far from here. What do I do now? Drink this up and everything will be all right. So sweet. I wish you were my childhood friend. Otherwise.. I wish you had been the first boy I ever met. Or else I wish that I had never met you. Hey! She's alive. Hey.. Drama Queen. Miss.. Look. She can't. Listen. Miss.. Mrs. Kushi.. Mrs. Kushi Kush.. Are you a friend, or an enemy or a wife, or a girlfriend or a lover, or my sweetheart.. Or, are you my lady love or my darling? I.. I don't know. But this is for sure. I will stay with you, forever. Don't get me wrong. I will never let go of your hand. Hey.. Hey, Kush.. Tsunami, Kush.. - Oh, no! Tsunami.. - Wake up, Kush! Tsunami! - Get up. Quick.. Tsunami has struck.. Hey.. There's no tsunami. It's just a wave. Oh, Kushi. - Oh, God.. Did I say anything to you last night? I don't remember. Did I say anything to you? 'Shall I lie to her that she proposed to me?' 'Why don't you lie that you proposed to me?' 'I will say 'yes'.' I got it. Meghna's marriage! Oh.. You're right. I almost forgot. There's soil. 'Around your eyes, stupid. You're not seeing clearly.' Let's go. Where are you both? We just landed. We're planning to go home first. No need. I have got the clothes, Kushi. Come here straight away. All right. We will come there. She asked us to go to the wedding hall. She has brought our clothes. - Is it? Finally, you both are here! Why are you dressed like this? Mom, she told you that we will go home and come. But you asked her to come here. Okay, where are my clothes? I need to change my clothes. Oh, no, I didn't get your clothes, I only got hers. Mom, why didn't you say so before? I would have worn something grand and attended Meghna's wedding. Look, there's ironed suit and sherwani why don't you wear them and attend her wedding? I don't know what you're going to do change your clothes soon. Come, Kushi. - Yes. Whose clothes are these? - Bridegroom's. - Bridegroom's? He shouldn't wear these. He should wear the shirt that he wore for the turmeric ceremony last night. Where's that shirt? - It's in the laundry. Oh, no.. Go get those clothes. Give it to me. - I'll take care of it. Go. You know what? According to our custom, you should wear what you wore last night for turmeric ceremony. - Oh. Didn't you know that? - No.. Take it. - Oh. He's familiar with our custom. But you don't know. You must wear this. Turmeric is beneficial to us, right? Yes, it's pretty good. It has antioxidants. Where are those garments? Hey, you're too young to wear such an attire. That is for adults. I'm struggling like this. I wonder what Kush is doing right now. Oh, no! Someone is opening the door. It's you. Lock the door before wearing the sari. Hey, where did you find this costume? I was standing alone. A boy asked me if I had breakfast and whether I need anything else. I said, I want an ethnic outfit that can be worn at a wedding. Did he give it? - Yes, that's how I could wear it. - Oh.. Why aren't you ready yet? I don't know how to wear a sari. Do you know? - No.. B.. I can. It's very simple. Just like dhoti, but it goes around twice, it has five folds and you drape it down on your shoulder. That's it. Oh.. Help me wear a sari then. Wear the jewellery and come soon, okay? Kush, why are you looking at me like that? Stop staring. You will cast an evil eye on me. I am not looking at you. Get lost. - You get lost. Why are you wearing a soiled shirt? Mom, it's part of their custom. This is why I'm against love marriages. Damn it. To hell with their traditions. Why are you wearing this shirt? I know it. It's part of your custom, isn't it? Is the food ready? Come. We will go have food. Okay. He told me that the food is ready. - Okay. Hey, you're Sumithra's son, Kush, aren't you? - Yes. You looked dumb when you were a kid. Now you look handsome. If I had known that you would grow up to be handsome I would have got my daughter married to you. Is she your daughter? - Yes, she is. She looked foolish when she was a kid. Now, she looks amazing. I will marry her now. What do you say? Did you hear.. - Sir, are you done eating? I need to talk to you, come. Didn't your dad come? - 'I think, she got annoyed.' 'Let me go express my feelings.' Ma'am, did you have food? - Not yet. You can have food from my banana leaf. 'If I don't stop him, he will keep flirting.' 'First, I should express my feelings.' Oh, Mrs. Kush.. I didn't drape the sari like this. Actually, Mr. Kush.. Even I know how to wear a sari. - Oh. So, you know how to wear a sari. In spite of it, you pretended and made me drape the sari.. How dare you.. - Who.. What are you doing here? - So what? Tell me. Hey! - What? Is she worthy of being a woman! What happened? - How can she speak like this? You are watching it, you tell me what happened. I don't know. Dad.. - What.. Speak politely.. - Why should I? I'm saying it politely. Listen, or else.. The consequences won't be good. Grandma, what happened? - Hey! What happened? - Why? - What happened to him? See.. - No.. - Hey.. Let's go. - Come. - Hey! - Kush. You scoundrel! Take her along. - Moron! Hey.. - Uncle. - Disgusting family! I'll teach you a lesson. - What.. Brother! - What happened? - No, come.. Come. I'll tell you. - Uncle, what's wrong? I'll tell you what happened! The arrangements are good. - Greetings.. Hey! - Sir! - Greetings. - How are you? - Good. Greetings.. Carry on. How are you.. - How are you.. I just love hugging you. - Hey! You have put on some weight.. - Hey.. Hey.. - Oh, no! Hey, I don't think you're wearing an underwear. - Hey! Take your hands off my husband. Why? Ma'am, what's the matter? I know that you're gay. Oh.. I forgot.. Hey! How dare you call me gay? I know what my sexual orientation is. My sexual orientation is none of your business. A womaniser's wife need not tell me what I am! What do you think of me? Hey! Whom did you call a womaniser? Him.. - Did you call my husband as a womaniser? What else? - How dare you! I'm not used to manhandling women.. - Hey, wait. ...don't make me do it. - I know that you're only used to touching men. Cur! What is it? Mom, before we could attend the wedding and come home they have sent us a divorce notice. What's it, Brother? - Divorce notice. What do we do now? 'I didn't answer his calls, so that rascal has glued it on the door.' 'What do I do now?' - What do we do? I have ruined my son's life. He said, he didn't want to get married now but we forced him to. When they are so daring, why should we back out? Kush, let's go to the court as well. Am I a womaniser! Me.. Am I a womaniser? I am not upset that both the families fought. But he called him a womaniser, that was quite upsetting. Only I know what I'm going through. Kush, I don't care about all that. She shouldn't come here. Brother, let me talk to her and do something. No! Just get rid of her. You must divorce her. That's it! Am I correct, Mom? Let's go inside. How dare they do this to us? Nonsense! 'Why is she so happy?' 'Does she approve of the fact that we are getting divorced?' Your Honour, she is using the mobile phone. Which phone is that, ma'am? - It's an iPhone, sir. Would you please give me the charger if you have it? Sure, sir, I'll give it to you. 'Sir, do you remember' 'what reason you've given for the divorce?' Are they talking without any reason or do they talk as they want me to tell them to be quiet? Take it, sir. Order.. Order.. Order.. The applicant, Kushi, who's standing in the witness box submitted Kush's medical report after going through them, the court has upheld the verdict that this couple is not fit to get intimate with each other. If both of them agree and sign the papers the divorce will be granted to them on the 29th of February. The court is adjourned. Grandma, I'm feeling very dizzy. Please bring me a cup of coffee. All right, dear. I'll bring it, right away. Why? What happened, dear? Don't answer the call. I'll see to it. This is an unwanted call. I disconnected the call. Whose call was it? - It was him. Nonsense! Do you know what I'm thinking? - What? Anyway, she's divorced. Why shouldn't we get her remarried? - What! You're absolutely right. Even I was thinking the same. What happened, dear? Dear! Kushi! Hey! What happened, dear? Oh, God! What happened? - She vomited. What else would happen? She has been roaming since morning, she didn't have anything to eat and she's stressed, too. Mom, please give her some food to eat. No. Kushi, you're pregnant, dear. You're pregnant! Oh! She isn't vomiting because of the food. She vomited because she's pregnant, is it? Kushi, what's all this, dear? What do you mean? Probably, she got intimate with another man or Kush must have impregnated her. He's not impotent. Kushi is not someone who'd cheat on her husband. Leave it! So, Kush is not impotent, he has impregnated her. Look, we don't need this. Think that everything happened for the good. Abort the baby and get ready to remarry. What! Grandma.. Dad, please! No need to abort the foetus, please! Let's think about remarriage. Please, don't ask me to get an abortion done, Dad. Please! What are you saying? How is that possible? A man will happily accept the responsibility of taking care of two women but will he agree to get married if he's asked to take care of your child as well. I don't think it'll happen. You must abort the baby. What do you say, Brother-in-law? - Why are you talking like this to her? Leave her alone. She has had enough in her life. Mom, keep quiet. Kushi, we'll be going to the hospital tomorrow morning to abort the baby. All right, Dad. Come. 'Dad, right now, my baby is the most precious thing for me' 'in the whole world.' 'You brought me into this world.' 'Even I'm bringing a baby into this world.' 'So, I want to save my baby.' 'Please don't search for me.' 'Otherwise, you'll lose me.' 'Inform everyone that I'll be safe.' 'Thanks for everything. Bye, Dad.' "I'm done playing hide-and-seek." "My dreams have been lost on the way." "It's time for me to live in solitude." "My loneliness has become my enemy." "My wishes are being washed away" "by my tears." "The full moon has flaws.." "She was like fire, even fire can be doused with tears." Kushi, I want to ask you something. Why aren't you informing Kush about your pregnancy? I've gone against my family. I divorced Kush. What if he asks me to abort the baby? No, I'm feeling scared to even think about it. I'll stay here till I complete seven months of pregnancy. Later, I can't abort the baby even if I want to. Don't worry. "There are hundreds of emotions" "I'm overwhelmed by these emotions." "I'm not able to stop my tears." "And those tears are yearning for your presence." Grandma, just now, I got my check-up done. I'm all right. Don't you worry. Okay.. All right, dear. It's time to prepare 'Shenga Holige'. Yes, Doctor. - All right! I'll take your leave. - I'll take your leave, sir. Everything is fine, okay? You may leave. Be careful. Hampa. - Sir? Make your wife sit outside and come back. Sure, sir. What had I told you? I had told you not to get her worked up, right? What's wrong with you? How many times did I tell you? What happened, Doctor? - Placenta Praevia. - Oh! Do you know what has happened? - What has happened, sir? The baby.. Upside.. This is how a baby looks when it's in the womb. The unwanted waste should be here. In your wife's womb, the waste is at this place. In such a case, it's difficult for the baby to breathe. During the delivery, the mother will bleed.. She'll bleed profusely. I'd told you not to make her do chores and tire her, right? Why did you do this? Sir, the money that you gave me was just sufficient to get the medicines. I didn't want to ask you for more money. The house rent, expenditure on medicines and expenses incurred for the operation.. So, both of us had decided to give you something once she gives birth to the baby. So, both of us took up a job of breaking stones. Are the mother and the child safe? Take good care of her. Don't let her pick any heavy objects, okay? Okay, sir. Grandma. - Kushi! My darling! How are you, dear? Dear.. - Oh! It's you! Why did you come back? Are you still carrying the baby! I wanted you to lead your life happily so, I asked you to abort the foetus. And you're still carrying the baby! Do you think you just descended on earth? I gave birth to you in the same way. Do as you wish to! He'll never change. You stay here. I'll ward off the evil eye cast on you, okay? - Yes. Grandma. I want my phone. It was lying here all these days. No one used it. Take it. It got turned off. Mom, she has seen the messages! 'The number you've called is switched off.' 'Please try again later.' She has switched it off. Probably, she's avoiding me. Did you inform your husband about the pregnancy? No, Grandma, I'm feeling very scared. Don't be scared. You have to inform him some or the other day. Inform him, today. You can't discuss everything over the phone. Back then, we didn't have any mobile phones or the Internet. Even then, there was no communication gap. Nowadays, you send various emoticons via WhatsApp to express your feelings but you fail to say what you want to. In olden days, our eyes would express all our feelings. But now, people use mobile phones to express their feelings. Go and speak to her directly. She might lie. She may not be aware of her feelings. But her eyes can never lie. 'You're right, Mom.' 'Earlier, people used to communicate with their hearts' 'and now, we communicate only with our phones.' All right, Mom. I have an important work in the hospital. I'll finish it and go to Kushi's home. How are you? I hope, you're doing good. I'm fine. - Good! You should be happy. If you're happy, even the baby will be happy. Hello. - Hello, Mother-in-law! How are you? Kushi! How are you, dear? I'm good. Is Kush at home? His phone is not reachable. He said that he wanted to meet you. He wanted to say something important to you. He has gone to the hospital. He'll finish the work and come to you. - Is that so? Okay, Mother-in-law. Thank you. What did she say? Kush is coming to meet me. - Wow.. 'Oh, it's you!' 'You grabbed me by my hand' 'on the streets the other day, right?' 'I'll teach you a lesson. Wait and watch!' What's happening here? The borewell is over there. Why is everyone looking in this direction? What happened? They don't have any energy to pump the water from the borewell. So, they're standing here helplessly. - Oh, no! Who will help us? Why are you saying so? I'm here, right? No one should worry when I, Bhageeratha, am here I am a social worker. I'm here, people! None of you have to worry. What is this? - You have strong arms. First, let me pump water from the borewell and then, I'll meet up with you. Come.. Oh, no.. Oh, dear! Don't you worry. I'm here for you. - Two pots of water.. I'll pump the water from the borewell for you. These machines are pretty old. - You're right.. Don't you worry. Ready! Let's do it! Your arms are so strong.. I'm sweating here but there's no water coming from the borewell. I can do it! There was no water coming from it since five years. Do you think it will come now, Bhageeratha? Let me fill.. - Quiet.. Sir. - Let go! - Quick. - Will you do it? What should I do? - Sir, donations! What should I donate? - Money for a kidney transplant, sir. What! I'm exhausted after pumping the borewell. Do you think I can hand it over? - No, sir. Who needs the kidney? - My brother, sir. - What? Did you find any donor? - Not yet, sir. First, find a donor, I'll donate it later. You can leave now. Sir. - Hey, don't stand here. I'm exhausted after pumping the borewell. I'll take Rs. 100 from this and buy a tender coconut. - No, sir! Give it to me. That's mine! - Don't run around, children. Hello. What do you want? I want to meet Kushi. You can't meet her. - Why? Hey, come here. - Yes? What is Kushi doing on the terrace? Ms. Kushi is talking to her future husband on the terrace. Did you understand? Today is her engagement. Did Kushi agree to it? Do you think we made all these arrangements for you? We arranged for the engagement once she gave us her consent. You may leave! Excuse me. Hold on! Anyway, you're here. So, sign this judgement copy. Because we'll be busy with the wedding arrangements so we won't have any time to do all this. 'How dare you call me gay?' 'I'll teach you a lesson!' I've given you the idea for your wedding. So, give me a treat. - Okay. - Kush.. Hold on, I'll be back. Walk slowly, dear. - Yes, Grandma. Uncle. - Yes? - Kush was here, right? - Yes. He left without talking to me. I will go talk to him. Stop! Why should you talk to him? You have so much feelings towards Kush and the baby. Look what he has done. He has signed the judgement letter. He wants you to sign it, too. I can't bear to see all this. 'He has sent the documents for me to sign..' 'So, I think, there's no place for me in his life.' Hello? Okay. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Hampa. I'm sorry! I couldn't save the baby. How's my wife? She's out of danger. I'm sorry, Hampa. It's okay, sir. Don't be upset. The grief of losing my child is nothing compared to the happiness that you gave me for the last nine months by telling me that my wife was expecting. That's enough for me. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a baby. God doesn't fulfil wishes even if we pray. You did so much for us though we didn't ask. You are great, sir! Stay blessed! I mean it, sir. I've got 'Shenga Holige' for you, sir. Please have it. I don't want it, Hampa. Don't refuse to have it, sir. We'll feel very sad. Kush, where were you? You didn't even call me up. Hold on, I'll keep this.. What happened, dear? Didn't you speak to Kushi? What happened? Mom, I used to feel very happy whenever I lift the babies. But today.. A baby didn't cry or smile. - Okay. The baby was quiet, Mom. It was heart-breaking to see it, Mom. Mom, I was scared that what if it had been my child! Mom, silence is more scary than sounds of laughter or sounds of someone crying. Even Kushi is silent. I'm feeling scared, Mom. Mom, I'll go out of town for a few days. Hold on, dear.. I'll talk to her once. Hold on. - Mom, you don't have to. Let her be happy.. - Hold on, dear. Listen to me, please! - Don't disturb her, Mom. I'll talk to her once. Please. Wait. - Mom. Hello? - Hello. Are you Ms. Savithri? You need not look for a groom. We have already found a nice guy. - No.. What are you saying? - Thank you.. Hello.. They don't have any shame.. Well done. We should find some guy for Kushi very soon and get her married. You're right.. You've anyway decided to get Kushi married. So, on this happy note, how about finding a bride for me and getting me married in the same wedding hall? If needed, I will marry once again. Sister! - Hey! But I will never get you married. - But why! You're a wastrel. Should I feed another wastrel? Firstly, do something that can be useful to someone. He wants to get married. Useless. 'Does he think I'm a wastrel?' 'I'll show them what I'm capable of.' 'Whom do you want the kidney for?' 'Sir, for my brother.' 'Have you found a donor? - Not yet, sir.' 'I'll prove myself.' Kush this is quite common in our profession. You have given your best every time. You are quite disturbed. Why don't you consider a change of place? You may visit our branch at Italy. I will make all the arrangements. New acquaintances, new surroundings.. Though you may not be able to forget your past you may feel hopeful and make a fresh start. Thank you, Doctor. "Oh, evening flower.." "Don't hope for the moonlight." "The lamp I had lit" "has taken away my breath." "The anger I nurtured" "is killing me." "We took the seven circumambulations, together" "now, we are walking away from each other.." "A rift.." "Even a statue that has no cracks" "has stopped yearning to be venerated." "The water drops.." "Tears are" "shed in sorrow." "The destiny that can't be shared" "has put us into this dilemma." "In the battle of love" "we're left all alone." Why did you bring me here? Kush and I made many memories here. Let's stay here for a few days, Grandma. Fine. Come. "I bid a farewell" "to these tears." "My heart is filled" "with the sorrows, forever." "I am going to a destination" "my journey will be laced with tears." "Breath is the essence of life" "taking each breath feels terrible." "If I didn't get you" "your memories will remain in the form of tears in my eyes." "I safeguarded my dreams" "you are shattering them." Hey, guys, it's Kush's call. Tell me, Kush, where are you? - I'm at Bangalore airport. Are you here? Come on, buddy.. Where are you, guys? - At the pub which we usually visit. Come soon. Fine, I'll be there. Hey! - Kush is back! Hey! Happy New Year, buddy! - Happy New Year, buddy. Come on. Hey, why? Okay. Hey.. Hey, Kush. - Hey, Kush! Yes, buddy. - Where are you going, buddy? What happened, buddy? I want to go. Give me the key. - Fine. I'll drop you. That's okay. I'll manage. What's wrong with him? Grandma.. - Tolerate it for sometime. I've already informed your dad, dear. Grandma, I can't tolerate it anymore.. - He is coming. Hello. - Where are you, dear? Mom, I'm bringing an ambulance. - Oh, no! Please come soon. I'll come soon, Mom. Grandma.. - I've informed your dad, dear. He's on his way. Tolerate it for sometime. Tolerate it for sometime. - Grandma.. He'll be here anytime. - Grandma.. - Just some more time, dear. Please don't cry. Mrs. Kushi Kush. Grandma. - 'I don't know' 'if you're my friend or my enemy' 'or my wife or my dream girl' 'or if you're my beloved or the one who rules my heart' 'or if you're in my life temporarily or are you special..' 'But one thing is for sure.' 'I will stay with you, forever.' Your dad is here, dear. I want to see Kush once, Grandma. Don't cry, okay, he'll come. - Even he loves me. - Okay.. Happy New Year, sir! I hope you're fine. - Yes, I am. Why did you call for the ambulance then? Since we don't get a cab at this hour I called for an emergency service. Fine. Kushi.. Just some more time. - I can't take it, Grandma. We'll reach the hospital soon. Mom, offer her some words of solace. Even we're in an ambulance and even we have a patient. Drive faster. - Hey, I'm fine. They may have a patient who needs emergency care. Give them way. Let them go first. Doctor, hurry up. Bring the stretcher. Hurry up.. Grandma.. - Careful. - I can't take it. Easy.. Be careful, mister. Dad! I can't take it. I want to see Kush once. Doctor, I think you've consumed some alcohol. - Not really. I'm sloshed! - Dr. Mahesh I searched you everywhere. Why are you here? Doctor, when did you come? - Just now. What happened, Doctor? - Ma'am. Happy New Year. - Hey, quiet. Why are you worrying for such a minor wound? - Doctor. We have an emergency delivery case. We don't have any surgeons here. - What about Dr. Chakrapani? He's not answering the call. How about Dr. Triveni? Sir, I doubt that they keep going somewhere since one year. Make the arrangements. I'll be there. Are you sure, Kush? - Yes. But, Doctor, it's a case of placenta praevia. Make the arrangements. Sir, the arrangements have been made for the operation. Grandma! - Kush! I'm fine. What brought you here? - Sir, your wife is the patient. Please hurry up. Kushi is chanting only your name, dear. Grandma.. Kush works as a surgeon in this hospital, right? Please. I want to meet him once. Please. Please call Kush. Please call him. Please. Doctor, I may not survive. But I want to meet him once before my death. It's okay. Inform Kush at least after my death. Kush.. Kush.. She's our child. Our child.. Congratulations. The child has taken after you. A pregnant woman always has desires. But I had a desire of being with you even before I was pregnant. At one point of time, I was worried if my child would ever get to see her father. But finally, it's her father who brought her into this world. I'm sure the child has taken after you. Fine, then. Let the child be with me. You're anyway marrying again. What? It's you who sent the divorce papers and asked me to sign. 'He has signed the judgement letter.' 'He's asking you to sign them, too.' 'I can't bear to see all this.' Oh, no! Is this what happened? I want to meet that bastard once. What brings you here? We should never tell anyone about the donations we make, Brother-in-law. Who among Kushi's relatives are here? They called you inside. Please come. You're here. Come in, buddy. Come.. Kushi.. Kush. Can you bring him closer? - Okay, ma'am. Uncle.. Oh, no! - Ma'am! Why, dear? You were a comedian in everyone's lives but why did you become a villain in my life? Actually.. - Don't slap him, ma'am. Why? People usually donate one of their kidneys but he has donated both the kidneys and is still surviving. It's a medical miracle. When did I donate two kidneys? I donated just one kidney to Tammanna. - Sir, Tammanna is not one person. They're two brothers. - Oh, no! Oh, no! - You have donated both your kidneys. Oh, they are siblings! Sir, you're a great donor. 'Be seated. The story is not yet over.' 'I will surely consume poison. - This is a never ending story.' 'Here you go.' 'I've been hearing this all these years.' 'Please have it at least today.' 'Come on, have it.' - Thank God! I think, this soap opera will end, today.' 'Just have it..' The sun has risen. He has illuminated the place. His presence signifies the break of dawn. It seems as if he's asking us to wake up as it's morning. Mom! Why did you call out to me, Mom? The dinner is ready. Call your dad. Mom, had you divorced my dad? Who told you? - My dad told me. Is it? I'll deal with him. Come. Why did you tell her about the divorce? 'Why?' 'Actually, she told me, she wants a brother.' 'So, I said, if I tell your mom, she'll divorce me once again.' 'She's smart enough. So, she understood.' 'Do whatever you want to!' 'Come, dear.' 'Do you want a brother from the same mother' 'or are you okay if he's born to your stepmother?' 'Mom, don't hurt my dad. The consequences won't be good.' 'That's like my daughter. - Both of you stay together. I'll go.' 'No. We want you, too. - I want a brother.' 'The end.'
