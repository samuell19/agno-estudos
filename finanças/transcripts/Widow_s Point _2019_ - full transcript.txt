Hey, I'm sorry, you really startled me. You drive all the way up here? Yeah, well, it's cheaper than flying. Stopped in a couple of little motels. Sure the accommodations here are a little nicer. You really think so? Well, more interesting, anyway. I stopped in town and got some groceries. You wanna give me a hand and... You ready to go in? Yeah, sure, I'm anxious to get inside. Ah, wow, this is great. This is really great. I think utility's turned on. Out of town cleaning crew will come in and make the place presentable. No local outfit will take the job. I think it's great just the way it is. That package there arrived for you yesterday. Oh, yeah, this is my research. You already know the alarm code. This is the key to the front door. It's a key to the gate. I'll lock the gate when I leave. Keep it locked at all times. What about the key to the lighthouse? Don't get clever. Our agreement clearly states that you are not to set foot in that tower under any circumstance. Well, you can't blame a guy for trying. I would've had the whole thing torn down years ago if the Harper's Cove Historical Society didn't make this thing a landmark. Tear it down? Because of a few little ghost stories? Stories are for children and adults with childlike sensibilities. Well, I sure would like to know your story. I'm not interested in telling it. Enjoy your stay. I hope it's uneventful. All right, well, you have a good day, Mr. Sunshine. You're not playing, Mr. Parker. Neither am I. In 1985, United Showcase Films rented the Widow's Point Lighthouse as the location for the movie "Rosemary's Spirit," which filmed in Harper's Cove for six weeks. Get the neutral density filter. Copy, Carlos. The gothic chiller was directed by Henry Rothchild and starred screen veterans Garret Utley and Britney Langshire. Popular daytime actress Lydia Pearl costarred as Rosemary. And it shall come. Well, darling, one more day and we'll be back in hills of Hollywood. I'm counting the minutes. Not a fan of Harper's Cove? Not a fan of our soap opera starlet. Oh, no worries there, she won't be on the soaps for long. You know, she has stolen this show. That's because she has all the best lines. Next time, I'm thinking maybe you'll wanna sleep with the writer instead of the director. You're just jealous 'cause I got there first. I'm gonna miss that charming wit of yours. Where is Lydia? She should be out of Makeup by now. Come on, this is her last shot. Let's wrap her already. This is Karl, does anyone have eyes on number three?! This is Mike. Number three went 10-1 20 minutes ago. I haven't seen her since. These actors are like children, you can't let them out of your sight for a second. Toddlers with agents. - Exactly. - Get her to set, now, Mike! Copy. Lydia, you in there? And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. Lydia, sorry to interrupt, but you're invited to set. And it shall come. And it shall come. Is everything okay? And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. Lydia? And it shall come. Xa'niyus awaits! Lydia! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Lydia! There's something wrong with her, really, really wrong with her. All actresses are crazy, don't you know that? Where is she now? I don't know. I lost her. How do you lose another human being? You should've never let her leave. What did you want me to do, tie her up? Wait a minute. There she is. What the hell is she doing? And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. What's this scene? Did you give her more to do? No, this isn't in the script. Not good, Henry. Lydia! Come down from there! And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. Get her down here, now! Uh-huh. Two weeks later, the security fence on the lighthouse grounds went up. Lydia Pearl was the most famous victim of the Widow's Point curse, but she was far from the only one. How the hell is my favorite client? Am I your favorite client? Well, you are today, right now. Well, I'm touched. Here's the million-dollar question: Where is my favorite client? I'm staying at the Widow's Point Lighthouse in Harper's Cove. Okay, I'll bite. Where's Harper's Cove? Why don't you look it up? Supposed to be one of the most haunted locations in America. Really? I like the sound of this. I thought you would. Abandoning his midlife crisis, literary aspirations. Thomas Livingston returns to the genre that made him famous. Well, you know, divorce isn't cheap. I need the money. I've been begging you to do this for years. Do you have an outline? No, I'm just here doing research. Well, how about a title? Right now, it's "Widow's Point." History of all the horrible things that have happened here over the years. Nonfiction? That's a nihilistic approach. But it'll be scary, right? This is gonna be the scariest thing I've ever written. That's all I need to hear to get you an advance. There's one more thing. I'm gonna be the first person in 30 years to stay in the actual lighthouse itself. A publicity stunt, I like this new you. I don't want anybody to know about this until the book's been published. Okay? I will take care of that. Rosa will handle the PR personally. Yeah, and get to work on that advance, would you? Baby, you know what I like. All right, I'll be in touch. On August 3rd, 1933, lighthouse keeper Patrick Collins invited his brother-in-law, Joseph O'Leary, and two other men to play cards in the room located beneath the lighthouse catwalk. Mwah. Patrick's wife Abigail tucked in their two children for the night. Mama? Yes, Delaney? Will you tell Papa and Uncle Joseph I said goodnight? Of course I will. And me? And you too, Stephen. Oh. Mwah. Goodnight, children. O'Leary worked as a dock worker in Harper's Cove. A lifelong bachelor, he was best known in town as the man who single-handedly foiled a bank robbery when the culprit ran straight into his formidable chest. Okay, see what you got, girls. I got a pair. I got nothing. Feast your eyes on these lovelies. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's that damned Irish luck. I'm Irish, how come I'm not winning? 'Cause you're black Irish. All right, I'm gonna go to the shitter. Pour me some more of that brown. It's some shitter. Yeah, I've noticed you use it enough. Yeah, at my age, your bladder can't be too choosy. "It's 'cause you're black Irish." Abby? Wait, you're not my sis. Who are you, and what the hell are you doing here? Well, answer me. What are you doing here dressed like that? Little late for a wedding. Start squawking, or I'll paste you! And it shall come. Xa'niyus awaits. Kill them all. Oh, my god. Boy, that was quite the piss. Sorry. I'm dizzy. That's what you get for drinking so much, you big ape. Hey, no come back? Well, he must really be sick. You do look awful. Hey, maybe you should stay here tonight. Yeah. Maybe that's for the best. Abby and the kids will be thrilled to see you when they wake up. Well, everyone's asleep. Help yourself to the icebox. I can't. I can't eat anything. You'll feel better in the morning when you count your winnings. Goodnight. That night, O'Leary composed the infamous rambling letter describing his supernatural encounter. And it shall come. Oh, my god. Oh, Jesus. The next morning, fishermen found O'Leary's body shattered on the ground below the lighthouse. The police made a more gruesome discovery inside. Patrick Collins was the last lighthouse keeper at Widow's Point. No one ever lived there again. - Hey. - Hey, you. Welcome to Widow's Point. I don't know whether to be excited or scared. How about a little of both? Just park it right over there. All right. It doesn't look scary. Yeah, you should see it when the sun goes down. I'm kidding. It's creepy as hell. Why are you doing this? You've never resorted to gimmicks before. Yeah, well, look where it got me. Besides, I wanna know the truth. Write that down. - Hey. - Hey, buddy. Andre, this is my publicist Rosa. Rosa, this is my right hand man Andre. Welcome to Spook Central. Nice toys. Thanks, I make documentaries when I'm not shooting commercials, so. Ah. Art versus commerce. - Mm. - I feel your pain. Okay, I want you to keep your eyes glued to this monitor all weekend. Okay, you got the best seat in the house. Should've brought some popcorn. So Thomas's camera will transmit the footage he shoots to this recorder. You'll listen to his audio from his wireless mic over these speakers. - Got it? - Yep. Guess I won't have much time to get reading done, will I? Oh, you're wrong about that. This is the research on Harper's Cove and Widow's Point Lighthouse. Mm. Even feels scary. All right, guys, Mr. Parker is gonna be coming back any time, so let's get this thing rolling, you know? And let's make some history this weekend, huh? - Okay. - All right. Okay, roll it. I mean, action. Hi, my name is Thomas Livingston, and I am standing outside of the legendary Widow's Point Lighthouse in Harper's Cove. Built in 1838, it was named for the widows of the sailors who died in shipwrecks below. In the decades that followed, nearly two dozen mysterious incidents occurred, including disappearances, suicide, and murder. Robert James Parker closed the lighthouse in 1933. 40 years later, his son converted it into a naval museum that lasted only a year. No human being has occupied the lighthouse for almost 100 years, that is, until now. I've arranged to spend the entire weekend locked inside this notorious landmark. I have no phone, no computer, no way to communicate with the outside world. I'll be completely cut off until that door is unlocked, Monday, at this same time. All right. Cut it. Nice work, Tom. You're a natural. This is all a joke to you. No, no, no. Mr. Parker, this is not a joke, okay? I take it very seriously. Eh. Come on, you guys, let's get the ball rolling. Walk this way. You're making a mistake. Well, that's your opinion, but you're paid well for my use of the lighthouse, sir. This is Rosa. I have picture from both cameras. Over. Copy. Good to go, Tom. All righty. No turning back now. Ah. And there she is. Woo. Sure does smell musky in here. It should. She's been breathing dead air for 30 years. Definitely not taking the cooler all the way up there. Come back down for water and food when I need it. It's your show. I will see you on Monday. If you say so. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we begin our journey into the heart of Widow's Point Lighthouse. I hope you're getting this, Rosa. Every second, Tommy. All right, looks good, sounds good. I'm taking off. Wait, you're leaving me here alone? Yeah, my work here is done and I don't feel like waiting around for no ghosts. There's my card if you have any technical issues. Okay. All right. Adios. Well, looks like it's just you and me, Tommy. The Widow's Point Lighthouse has 69 steps, and I'm getting to know each one, intimately. Wow. Looks like this will be my penthouse for the next three nights. That is the table where Patrick Collins played cards with his brother-in-law. The air is thick and stagnant in here, like something is alive and waiting. Way to sell a story. Now, let's see what's up there. Spooky. Whoa. Mother Ocean as far as the eye can see. It's almost enough to render me speechless. O'Leary leapt to his death from here, and Lydia Pearl hung herself. I wonder, were there others? What is that? Looks like someone left their mark here. I gotta get something to drink. My god, that's salty. That's salty too, what's going on here? Okay, now you're making me thirsty. 22. 23. 24. 25. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. The candlelit dinner for one? Hm? Mm. Mm. Here's looking at you, kid. - Mm. - Back at you. In 2007, a local fisherman called the Harper's Cove police and reported seeing someone on the catwalk of the Widow's Point Lighthouse. No one was supposed to be up there, so Officer Richard Mellon, a third generation Harper's Cove cop, drove out for a look. A car parked out front belonged to Clifford McGee, a third-year photography major at Vanderton College in Waterville, Maine. Two days earlier, McGee left a note for his roommates explaining he had found the perfect subject for a photo essay. Clifford McGee? Are you okay? Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey, turn around... Oh! Whoa, easy. Easy, easy now. There we go. There we go. Calm down. That's it. That's better. There we go. Calm down. That's it. What do you say we, whoa. Whoa, whoa! What's gotten into you? Was the lighthouse denied another victim? McGee is catatonic and institutionalized to this day. Detectives examined the memory card of his camera, 128 megabytes, all full. Over 5,000 photos of the sea, all taken from the same angle from that same spot on the catwalk over a 24-hour period with no deviation. Two weeks later, Ronald Parker installed security alarms throughout the lighthouse. I haven't opened this notebook since I've gotten here. But it's open now. This writing wasn't here before. I've never seen it before this moment. You really want that bestseller, don't you? "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Harper's Cove Gazette. August 4th, 1933. Looks like a journal. Delaney Collins. What the hell? Shit. Wait a minute. Yeah, I still hear you. DC, Delaney Collins. This should be interesting. - Hello? - Andre, this is Rosa. Well, hey, what's up? I've lost picture on the monitor, but I still have audio from the camera mic. That doesn't make sense. Okay, well, I'm gonna need you to get this working again. It's after eight o'clock. I don't care. We rented your gear for the weekend and we need it all weekend. All right, all right. Give me a half hour. Make it 20 minutes. "My name is Delaney Collins. "I'm 12 years old and I live in a lighthouse "in Harper's Cove with my parents and my brother. We moved here a year ago, and I love it. Sometimes, it feels like I can see forever from here. Stephen is such a brat, but he never gets in trouble. It's always my fault as far as Father is concerned. Sometimes, I wish I was an only child. Almost 100 years ago, when the lighthouse was built, three men walking on the catwalk fell to their deaths. No one knows why. Something is wrong here. Sometimes, it smells dead and rotten. I see things from the corner of my eye, like shadows that move when they shouldn't. Nobody else sees them. Nobody else feels them. That doesn't mean they aren't there. ♪ This old man, he played one ♪ ♪ He played knick-knack on my thumb ♪ ♪ With a knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone ♪ ♪ This old man came rolling home ♪ Hey, what are you doing? If I see her again, I'm telling Mama. I know what she'll say, "There's no such thing as ghosts, Delaney Jane Collins," but I don't care. I have to tell someone. I don't want to go to sleep, because I'm scared. You, my dear, you are far too old to be having such dreams, Delaney Jane. It wasn't a dream. Okay. Well, then, it was your imagination. No more "Legends of Sleepy Hollow" for you. She was real. There is no such thing as ghosts. I know what I saw. Then why didn't your brother see her, hm? You sleep in the same room. He was asleep! Oh, sweetheart, so were you. I snuck down to the beach. I know I shouldn't have. Father has warned me it's dangerous, and Mother has made me promise to never go down there without them. Delaney! Watch for poison ivy. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! 10! 11! 12! 13! 14! 15! 16! 17! 18! 19! 20! Ready or not, here I come! Got you! What happened, Delaney? Stephen Patrick, what did you do? Nothing, we were just playing. Delaney, why did you scream? I saw... You saw what? A rat. Don't worry, girl. No rat can hurt you here, nothing can. I'll always keep you safe. The lighthouse is playing games with me. This is a bad place. People aren't meant to live here. Stay out! Don't come in here! I mean it! Don't come in here! I'm not afraid of you. Stephen? Stephen, give me that knife. Give it to me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's okay. Everything will be all right. Don't worry, I won't tell Mama and Papa. My prayers have been answered. The ghost is gone and it's been three weeks since I had a nightmare. Tonight, Father has one of his Poker games in the lighthouse. I'll get to see Uncle Joseph. I'm looking forward to a wonderful night. That poor, sweet, innocent girl, butchered by a madman. It's almost too much to bear. This doesn't make any sense. Right, the only reason we should have time code over solid black is if that Tom somehow hit the record button with the lens cap still on. You can see he didn't do that. And he couldn't even reach the camera from there. Could someone else have done this? You think he's pulling a hoax? I don't know, without image, no one can disprove anything he says is happening in there. Plausible deniability. No one put a cap over the lens. Watch, it goes from picture to black, picture to black, picture to black. A cap never even enters the frame. Oh, hold it. What? You see this? This is known as a flash frame. These used to happen all the time in film, but we're working in digital, so I guess it's a glitch. What is that? I don't know. Weird? Okay, well, can you do anything with this image? I guess I could use color correction to open up some more detail. Do it. We're gonna have to stop recording while I transfer the footage to my laptop. That could lead to accusations that we tampered with the footage. Do it. Jesus. God, that's even saltier than before. All right, I am knocking down the exposure and opening up the detail. Voila. Oh, my god. Do you see her? I see something. Okay, Thomas is holding Delaney Collins's journal. He says her name here, and that's when the camera glitched. Delaney Collins, the little girl that was murdered here? Yeah. Yeah, look. This is her right here, and that sure looks like her too. Don't you see it? Again, I see something. How can you not see it? I don't know, people see different things when they look at the same cloud. No, that's her. I know it is. The question is, how did he pull it off? Here. Found these in the closet. They're a little dusty and mothy. Oh, good. Thanks for staying. I feel embarrassed for asking. Don't worry about it. I'd be afraid to stay alone here too. Sure you don't wanna stay in one of the rooms? No, I better stay up and keep listening to Tom. Taking one for the team. Cool. Well, I'm gonna head to bed. I'll see you in the morning. Perfectly fine. Yee-hoo. It's late. I am exhausted. I will put the camera in motion detector mode and I'll leave the audio activated all night, and, hopefully, I won't see anything incriminating in my sleep. What in the hell was that? Did you hear that? It sounded like footsteps. Hello, who's out there?! Where's my flashlight? What? Great, no lock. Where's that flashlight? It was absolutely fine last night. What the hell? Oh, maggots. Oh, god. Doesn't that look like a yummy meal? Good morning. Hey. How'd you sleep? Not good. That was some storm last night. Yeah, you're not kidding. How's our subject? Is that what he is? I thought we were his captive audience. He's talking to himself a lot more. Writers do that. He's probably just rehearsing for an interview for Playboy or something. How about some breakfast? As long as it isn't covered in maggots. Hm. Yum, glad you told me. Mm-hm. So, how are things in Haunted House Land? He's playing us, Marshall. I don't know how, but he's blocked the image from the camera, so we're only getting audio. Why would he do that? So we can't see what's going on in there, which is nothing. He's putting on his own radio drama like Orson Welles. Sweetie, that's just behind-the-scenes footage, like they do in all the movies. Don't get wrapped up in it. Let him do his thing. He's making us accomplices to his hoax. This little weekend excursion is gonna generate plenty of sexy copy once his book is published. Did you get that image I texted you? I really couldn't make out too much, not with that light flare. Yeah, those are hotspots, commonly associated with paranormal activity, which he wants us to believe. I really wish he worked that hard on his last four books. And I hope this doesn't blow up in our faces. You worry too much. Goddamn bullshit. Delaney. Delaney's right, that it's really fucked up in here! Empty. Empty? Empty! Water. Someone's playing games around here. Saltwater. Andre! Sea. Seawater. Rosa! Help! Oh, god. Please, just stop. Please. Do you hear that? I don't hear anything. Exactly. We've lost audio now. There's nothing coming through the mixer either. The signal has just stopped. See? No more time code. Couldn't it just be the batteries? Not on our end. Okay, so I snuck a phone in, big deal! Come on, answer. Come on. Come on. Hello? Now we've lost audio. You don't say. We have no idea what's going on in there, or if Thomas is okay. What do you think is happening in there? Nothing. Well, we have nothing to worry about, then. This is all showmanship. I didn't think he had it in him. Do you mind if I come home early? How early? Today. You sound scared. I'm a city girl, I don't belong here. I need you there when Thomas comes out of the lighthouse. This will be over before you know it. Come on, you bitch. Worthless piece of shit! Where in the hell did my phone go? Give me back my phone! Delaney! 97. 98. 99. Should be 69 steps. Why haven't I reached the top yet? I read Thomas's research notes last night. In 1836, two years before this lighthouse was built, a clipper ship called the Pisces sank out there during a storm. All hands were lost. A sailor named Jonah Burch left behind a widow named Rebecca. Jonah and Rebecca made their home in New Hampshire, and when Rebecca found out about her husband's death, she came to Harper's Cove. She spent three nights in town, and then disappeared. A week later, her broken body was found on the rocks below. She was wearing her wedding dress. The local doctors determined that the fall broke several of her bones, but it didn't kill her. She suffered for days, trapped on those rocks, before dying of exposure and slow hemorrhaging. That's harsh. Rebecca Burch is the widow this point is named after. 200, will you look at that? 201. 202. 203. Andre! Rosa! Rosa! Andre, help me! Oh, my, oh, my god. Jesus! Are they gone? Or am I? They're back. Rosa?! Rosa?! What? It's night. It can't be night already! It's not possible. It's nighttime. How the hell this get up here? If I had a rope, I could just climb down. Or hang myself. Somehow, I lost an entire day. I know it's impossible, but it happened. And now it's raining. Somebody wrote in my book. I admit I did it the last time, okay? It was me, all right? I lied and I admit that. Whether out of showmanship or bullshit or whatever, I lied. But this, this is real, okay? Somebody's fucking with me.

The Kwakiutl tribe call it Xa'niyus, devil fish. The Polynesians called it Kanaloa, the god of the underworld. The Micronesians called it Na Kika. And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. What was that? Xa'niyus has been trapped here for eons. It requires an enormous amount of energy to return to its world, energy derived from human souls. It sank the ships and killed the sailors. It's been storing the energy it needs here in the lighthouse. It's like one giant battery. Only when it collects enough souls will it have the energy it needs to leave. We are its servants. You'll serve it too. You'll stay here with us. Not on your lives. You don't have a choice. It's already here. Oh, my god. The hell? No. That thing will never take me alive. Xa'niyus doesn't want you alive. What if I kill it? Will you all be freed? And it shall come. And it shall come. And it shall come. Xa'niyus can never be killed. We'll see about that. Oh, god. Turn that damn thing off. I'll go call the constable. Oh, my lord. The police and EMTs just left. We need to do something with Thomas's car. What I need to do is talk to our legal department, right away. I warned you. Lawyers don't need to know that, do they? Not necessarily. What did you have in mind? Thomas had a great story here at Widow's Point Lighthouse. Oh, one could argue it's an even better story now. I wanna be the one to write it. Nonfiction? You want it to sell, don't you? You'll have to write it fast in order for it to be timely. Yeah, no problem. I have Thomas's research notes, but I'm gonna wanna do some of my own too. What kind of advance were you hoping for? We'll talk when I get back to New York. Ghosts around me and sing my name. Widow's Point Lighthouse will never let me leave.
