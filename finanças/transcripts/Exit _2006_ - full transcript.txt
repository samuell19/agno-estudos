There?s one thing you should know if you want to make money in business: Nothing is about luck. Negotiations are a game. You have to know your opponent. Or you risk losing everything. If you don't hate losing, you'll never be successful or rich. But the boundary of ethics can sometimes be stretched to its limit. Our partner, Morgan Nordenstr?le, had crossed the line once too many. We couldn't take it anymore. We have to look over the third quarter. I told you to empty out your office and turn in your keys. - My father built this company. - And you almost tore it down. - All this Caesar Batanga stuff, I... - Wouldn't it be best... Get out of here before I call the guard. Thomas... I'm... I'm just going to get a picture of my family that I forgot. - I don't think we should pressure him. - He's sick, I want him out of here. I never want to see that lunatic again. 7 YEARS LATER Like I said, we couldn?t take anymore. Morgan got us involved with the IT company Cataegis- - and used unacceptable methods to convince the owner, Batanga, to sell. A few days later, Batanga was found dead. He'd hanged himself. It was a tragedy, but as it turned out, the business deal was a success. Cataegis was the best investment we'd ever made. Today, it's one of the largest IT companies in Europe. The shares have gone up several hundred percent since going public. Our company, Nova Investment, is a venture capital company. We invest our clients? money in companies that show potential and then sell our share at a profit. The deal was to sell our shares and leave Cataegis after a certain time. And that time is now. Soon, we can put this shareholders' meeting and fiscal year behind us, and look back on a fun and exciting year. Exciting because we introduced new services, and fun because not only did profits increase, costs decreased. We can now turn our attention to... Why is Nova Investment selling if everything is going so well? Maybe because that's when you sell. I don't feel it's my place to answer. I'll turn the question over to their representative: Thomas Skepphult. Thanks. We've never made a secret of our intent to exit Cataegis. - I'm against the sale. - All shares will go up 30%. My opinion is that Extreme Capital Group's agenda and reputation, are incompatible with Cataegis' goals. They've built their company by making unethical investments. I can assure you that Extreme Capital Group's goals and interests, both ethical and financial, are the same... The agreement says Nova Investment needs 60% ownership in order to sell. You only have 40%. I demand that we take a vote. I guess we'll have to vote. But in order to do that we're going to need a few minutes. Gabriel M?rk is talking about morals. It's enough to make you want to puke. Gabriel M?rk. A master negotiator who always finds his opponents? weaknesses. I didn't know your morality was so strong. Morality sells, didn't you know? What are you smiling about? Why didn't you consider my offer for Cataegis? - Because we got a better one. - Don't try that with me. Nova Investment is going to invest in GM Oil. If Swedish ownership increases I may have to pay taxes. I don't want that. That's why we're here. You want my 25% for the vote and I want you nowhere near my oil company. We're canceling the vote because, as it turns out, Nova Investment has the necessary votes needed to sell their shares... We're not going for GM Oil. You're responsible for everything being in place for Monday's signing. Of course. I'll see you on Monday. Here are the candles. Where will you put them? There's no space anywhere. - Can you take the present? - No. - It's better if you take it. I swear. - I'm not doing it. I'll take the cake. - You'll have to teach her. - Look at the cake! Happy birthday, Ebba. What could it be? Can I see? - A horse. - Your horse. We couldn't bring it, but we're going to the stables later. You know horses require a lot of work, right? - I'll help you, sweetheart. - I think we should sing to Ebba. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... No, that one. - That one? - Yes, that one. Should we see what it is? It's so pretty. It's not just any heart. It's a magical heart from olden days. Shall we put it on? Do you know why it's a magical heart? Do you want to know? If there?s something you really want to know, but don't... ...just put this on and you'll know everything. - What are you talking about? - I got a magical heart. How pretty. Did dad give you that? I want to speak to Thomas in private. Of course. - How come they brought this up now? - The question is, what do they know? Damn. - I'm leaving now. - Okay. Karin? - Did Wilhelm tell you where he went? - To Strandv?gen. Neither Karl nor Louise know about this. Much less the hidden compartment. - You said you'd destroyed the tape. - I know. - Why did you keep it? - I never meant to. Do you want to have a look? Are you sure? Would you like a drink? Everything will work out with Cataegis. Don't you worry. I've been meaning to talk to you about something. - It's time that you took over. - What are you saying? There's a time for everything, Thomas. But why? I mean, why? - Because it's time. - "It's time"? What are you saying? It's not that big of a deal. What's happening with you? You can't just up and quit. And the tape that you should have gotten rid of. Calm down. - I want to spent time with my family. - That's bullshit! - Your marriage is beyond salvation. - What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. Naturally, I won't leave until everything is resolved. Trust me. You must be Wilhelm Rahmberg's wife. - Hi, by the way. I'm Diana Malm. - Louise. Have you eaten, Ebba? I'm sorry, Louise. Do you know if Rahmberg had any enemies? No. - No, I don't think so. - Think carefully. In crimes such as these, the motive, nine times out often, is emotional, like hate, jealousy or it's quite simply for financial gain. - You met with Rahmberg last night. - Yes. - What did you do? - We talked, about... ...well, business. Rahmberg was planning to retire. How did you feel about that? Naturally, I thought it was a shame. He's been my mentor, my partner... ...and my friend for the past fifteen years. We found a contract in a safe at Rahmberg's place. The contract states that if one partner dies, the other, can buy that partner's share for two million. It's not unusual to draw up contracts like that when the company is new. All your energy is focused on making the business grow. As I understand it, Nova Investment's investments are worth ten billion. And according to the contract, you get sole control over all this. If you suspect me of anything, I'd like to be told. I suggest that you call your lawyer. Are you suggesting that I killed him? - The Philip Ceder Law Firm. - Thomas Skepphult for Philip Ceder. One moment, please. Thomas. - Is Philip Ceder there? - I'm back to settle old debts. - Who am I speaking to? - Don't you recognize my voice? No. Can I please speak to Philip Ceder? - That may present a problem. - Is this a bad joke? Who are you? Thomas, Thomas, Thomas. First Caesar Batanga and then me and now Wilhelm. That wasn't very bright, now was it? Hello? - Are you still there? - Who is this? I've followed you through the years. You're getting better. Quite impressive. It was a mistake to take her last name. You found it sounded better, I'm sure. But you must know that you can't outrun yourself. I know what kind of man you are. Like I said, it's time to settle old debts. I'm standing outside Nova Investment. Sources tell us the police have arrested Rahmberg's partner, Thomas Skepphult. We have no confirmation if he is a suspect in Rahmberg's murder... This is absurd. Don't you think you should come stay with me for a while? - Why? - You can see for yourself. You have contacts in the police department. Tell them it's a mistake. - I've spoken to them. - And? They said they'd never do all this if they believed Thomas was innocent. - And what did you say? - If you had only listened to me. They've found conclusive evidence. - Anna? - I want you to leave now. I want you to know that I will always be there for you and Ebba. Always. My client was redirected when he tried to call me today. He talked to a person who my client believes killed Rahmberg. - My client was also threatened. - Threatened? How? Essentially, this man said that my client is next. - Who were you redirected to? - He claimed to be Morgan Nordenstr?le. - Why would someone want to claim that? - I don't know. Why can't it be Nordenstr?le? Because he's dead, he killed himself. I think you should check out this call. Are we done? We found a crowbar missing from the tools in the garage. It was just like the one used in the murder. Anything else? The prosecutor wants him arrested for the murder of Wilhelm Rahmberg. Shouldn't you check out the call first? The fingerprints on the crowbar belong to your client. It could have been stolen and planted on the scene. My client is innocent. He will make himself available to the police. We're talking about his friend... It's time for your arraignment. And you have a call from your lawyer. Right here. - Hi, Philip. - Your beautiful wife looks a bit tired. Who was the man whose head you blew away? Do you approve of her smoking? I remember you as a clean living sort. - What do you want? - Access codes for the offshore account. - What offshore account? - You know. The one you have at least 75 million in. Charming girl, that Ebba. She's advanced for her age, very talkative. - She mentioned a magical heart. - You're sick. What's my guarantee you won't hurt my family? Guarantee? Since when did that word hold any meaning for you? The access codes, please. - I don't have them on me. - You have an hour. - Then the guarantee runs out. - What are you saying? - One hour. - What will happen then? - There's no one there. - I have to call... - We're leaving. - I have to call my wife. - Take it easy. - I have to call my wife! What are you doing? I have to call my wife. Listen to me, I really have to call my wife. Can you just be quiet? Wait here. Wait. - How much to let me use the phone? - Shut up. Okay? What the hell are you doing?! Damn! ENTER PIN CODE Hey! Do you have a phone I can borrow? I need a phone. Stop! Grab him! Stop that man! - Did you hear? - What? - Thomas Skepphult escaped. - What the hell are you saying? Dammit! It's not my fault. - Where's the damn kid? - It's happening. - What does that mean? Where is she? - They'll be there soon. He can't find the place. What is he supposed to do, call the cops? I promised you I'd take care of this. I've done it before, right? I'm sorry, Ahmed. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I was hasty. I don't want you to think me unfair. Come on, hit me and we're even. - This isn't business. - Hit me. Not until you've paid me. Pay you? Just get the damn kid. I can't sing anymore, I'm getting hoarse. - Hello. - Hi. Is your husband here? He's escaped and we were wondering if we could come in? - Has your husband contacted you? - No. - Why would he escape? - I have no idea. - He says he didn't kill Rahmberg. - Of course he didn't. Who do you think might help him? - Is he going to flee the country? - Flee? How long did you say he'd known Wilhelm? I didn't. 15-16 years. Do you know if they met before or after Thomas's jail time? I don't know. Please call me if he contacts you. I checked out Nordenstr?le. Turns out his mother identified the body. - Why does Skepphult claim he's alive? - He's lying. I know the type. It's always about money. We have to dig deeper into his affairs. - Anna. - Why aren't you answering? - Meet me in the street with Ebba. - What are you doing? - Just do what I say! - Why did you escape? Just do what I tell you! Meet me in the street! I forgot my magic heart! Anna! - Yes? - Take your car to the office. Now! Okay. Fabian von Klercking. Where are you? What's going on? I'm on the boat. Listen, can you help me? - Fabian? - Yes, of course. With what? Anna and Ebba are on their way, can you take care of them? A man called Preben Smed... A Dane called Preben Smed... He'll be there in three hours to take care of my family until this is over. Philip told me about that wrong connection. Is it true? Of course! Listen, the only important thing is that you take care of them. I promise. Hey... - Do you want me to check it out for you? - I'd appreciate it if you could. - Take care. - Fabian? Thanks. No problem. The family got away. I just don't understand it, Thomas... You look like hell. You're gray. - How are they? - They're fine. Thanks for helping out, I really need it right now. You know it's going to cost you. One million per week. - Do you have that kind of money? - Yes. Anna will have to get it for you. - Great. - But she doesn't know where it is. I wrote down the name and address of the bank here. What are you going to do? I don't know. What can I do? I'll go to the police, explain everything. - Do you want me to take you? - What do you mean? - Want me to drive you? - What does that mean? - The police doesn't believe you? - Not yet. They're never going to believe you. They won't look for Morgan, he's dead. They think you've killed your partner. Don't you understand? You'll just sit there and wait for the police to find something. It'll cost you a million a week, for how long? One week? Two, three? - You hit a police officer. - I get it. What can I do? - Let me take care of it. - What would you do? - Do you have any leads? - I don't even know what's happening. - Has anyone acted suspiciously? - Yes. We have a deal with some people from Belarus. It went south. I don't know what happened, but someone was behind it. They're still in town, staying at a place called Scandic Park Hotel. Are you going to keep those? - Do you have somewhere to sleep? - Yes. - I don't mean your summer house. - I have another place. Take it easy and relax. - I'll call you. Tomorrow. - Okay. Danes. I know a Swede who's worked with those Danes before. He's working with them now. He's by the side of the house. Okay. He owes me. I saved his life in prison. I need to ask you a favor and you're not going to like it. There's a clause in the contract that says, that if one of the partner dies, the investors can withdraw their funds. - Our law firm has backed out. - They had good reason to. - We need someone for legal advice. - I don't think anyone would do it. There is one person. No. If you had watched your own father be that degraded... ...that humiliated... Gabriel took everything. I know, I know. We don't want anything to do with him. Gabriel M?rk wanted to buy our share in Cataegis. We're going to let him. He'll help us, buy our share. We'll have no further dealings. Do you have the slightest idea what you're asking of me? I think I do. I wouldn't ask if you weren't the only person I could trust. - When do you want me to talk to him? - Now. Today, if possible. - Okay. - Thanks. Thanks. I won't forget this. I checked out that redirect. The law firm had a temp from a temp agency that day. A man named Ahmed Aalam paid her to redirect you to the wrong person. Do you want me to check him out? The technicians haven't found any tapes for the camera. Have you seen any? Do you know a man named Morgan Nordenstr?le? His family owned Nova Investment before Wilhelm and Thomas bought it. And they bought all his shares? It was at the same time as that Caesar Batanga affair. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing? Why haven't you called? Don't you realize how worried I am? Why don't you turn yourself in? And where did the money in the safety deposit box come from? Can't you just answer me! They said you'd spent time in jail. Have you? - Do you want me to answer all that? - That's why I'm standing here. Where should I start? I've never been in prison. Who said that? - I was in a juvenile facility a month. - Was that where you met? Who is he? - You bring these people into our home... - He's my cousin Preben. Why haven't you told me you have a cousin? I read that your father wasn't dead. What is up with that? You told me he's dead, that he died when you were young. You've said a lot of things and apparently none of it is true. You have a great father. I have a father I'd rather see dead. That's the big difference. Why haven't you told me this? Because it's hard. But it's me, Thomas. It's me. I'm sorry. I'm talking to a man who knows where Morgan is. Then I'm going to the police. - Really? - I promise. Do you know of a man in Stockholm named Ahmed Aalam? No. How come? - I think he knows where Morgan is. - Okay. And you're going to turn Morgan over to the police? - Yes, of course. Why? - He's already dead. You don't have to do it yourself. Did you talk to the Russians? They'd already checked out. I'm trying to find out where they live. I'll check out Ahmed later. - I'll call you. Okay? - Yeah. What are you doing? I thought I'd carry her to her bedroom. The police have launched an investigation of Rahmberg and Skepphult. It goes back to when they bought Nova from the Nordenstr?le family. - You have one new message. - I checked out Ahmed Aalam. He owns a restaurant in Sollentuna called "Aptitkungen". Call me. - I need to speak to Ahmed. - He's back there. Thanks. Hello? - Who are you? - Are you Ahmed Aalam? What do you want? I have a business proposition for you. If we can come to an agreement, this is yours. And a lot more. - What's the proposition? - How much did Morgan offer you? He hasn't paid you yet, right? He was never reliable when it came to business. - A bit too temperamental. - What do you want with Morgan? That's 50000. You'll get 450000 if you tell me where Morgan is. Do you have the money? - Do we have an agreement? - When do I get it? - When you show me where Morgan is. - Okay. Get in here. - How much money did you say? - That, plus 450000. - But you want me to sell out Morgan? - At least I'll pay you. You're right about that. He's a bit temperamental, and not reliable when it comes to business. - 450000. - That's right. You know, Morgan will butcher me if he finds out. 450000... 450000 bucks. 450000 smackaroos. - How much do you want? - How much do you think my life's worth? One million. One million... What would I do with one million? - Open up a kebab stand in Baghdad? - Two. Do you want two? What good does money do me if I'm dead? Do you want to do business or not? "Do business..." Weren't we supposed to leave this morning? I can't take staying here much longer. I'm worried about you. And me too. We can't leave if we don't have money. The police came to Strandv?gen. They asked about you. I'm dead, Louise. They're looking for a video tape. What tape? They found your old video camera, but it looked out of place. I want you to find that video tape. How come? Because it's mine. What's on the video tape? It's... ...my life... ...my soul, my name... ...my failure. So... Is everything okay? 1500 kg of pressure. Oops. How much do you want? You think people would do anything for money. But you're wrong. Money is nothing when you're hurting really really badly. You have to find the spot that hurts the most. You wouldn't have come to me unless you had 450000 in cash. I want that money. It's on a boat in Nacka Strand. It's called Glory Days and in the bathroom there's a first aid kit. Come with me. - What are you doing here? - I'm going to the bathroom. - Yes? - There's someone in the house. One of your men is working for Morgan. Check on Ebba. Shut up! Do what I'm telling you, check on Ebba. I saw pictures of her sleeping. I'll call you back. What is it? - Nothing. - Did something happen? Stay here. Okay, what's happening? How is Ebba? - She's fine. You saw pictures? - Yes. Someone had filmed her with a cell phone while she was sleeping. - I'll find out who it is. - Shut up. What am I paying you for? Take it easy. I'm going to find out. Morgan... He lives in Belarus and has connections with the mob. Okay. I want to know everything about him. Do you understand? Everything. Gather up the Swedes in the living room immediately. - Yes? - Who are you calling? Who are you calling? Lock yourselves in the bathroom right away. The girl is in the bedroom. Get going. - Where are they? - In the bathroom. The shareholders can't sell their Nova Investment stock. - I can't stop them. - Your lawyers can. That's the only condition we place on your Cataegis acquisition. I never thought I'd do business with a von Klercking again. The deal is only valid until Thomas is proved innocent. - If he is. - He is. So you trust him? And you expect me to take a von Klercking's judgment, as my only guarantee that Skepphult is innocent? I stand to lose a lot if you?re wrong. If I'm right you will make a lot of money. My reputation is at stake here. Reputation? If you?ve got nothing else I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer. I helped your father when he was as low as he could get, but he betrayed me. But you wouldn't betray someone. I like that. What I'm asking is, why are you making such an effort for Thomas's sake? - That's my business. - You're wasting your talent. No one will ever work with Thomas again. You're wrong. I will work with him. What would you say if I offered you a very good job? I think you can find the door on your own. I'll tell my lawyers to get started tomorrow morning. The lab technicians found this on one of the bodies outside. - Morgan Nordenstr?le. - It would seem like it. Hi, Anna, it's me. Call me at this number, it's new. As soon as possible. Bye, honey. - Damn, you scared me. - Where have you been? - What are you doing here? - Where have you been? - I had to run an errand. - What kind of errand? Is everything alright? They knew we had someone on the inside. The wife and daughter got away. How the hell did that happen?! No clue. What's in the bag? - Just some stuff. - Show me. Show me what's in the bag. Show me what's in the bag! I have Thomas in the basement. Let me make a call. I'll make him tell you what you want to know. Okay? - Use the speaker phone. - Okay. - Anna? - Zero? Looking for Zero, are you? You big fat pig. How are you, sweetheart? - And what about Ebba? - She's sleeping. You have to get out of here, understand? I've spoken to my friends in Marbella. You can stay with them until this is over. The plane leaves tomorrow. - I just have to talk to Thomas first. - I know what happened at your house. The police found men dead there. You have to think about Ebba. - Forget Thomas. - I have to talk to him, dad. - You're blind. You don't know him. - Oh, but you do? My opinion of Thomas doesn't matter any longer. That Morgan character is apparently still alive and he's a maniac. You must realize that Thomas did something. It's time for you to decide who really matters to you. Oh god... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... This is Fabian von Klercking, I can't... This is a court order. I'm here to search the premises. - I'm the person in charge. Can I help? - That all depends. Can you tell us Caesar Batanga's position in Cataegis- - before Nova Investment bought the company. Do you know of him? Not really. I only know that he killed himself... a very long time ago. We've cleared out the staff. - You have to leave. It's just me. Can you call me right away? Thanks. - Okay, how did it go? - Well, I just need some signatures. Thank you. - How are you? - So-so. - Preben has found Morgan. - What? Preben has found Morgan. It looks like he was living in Belarus. - So just go to the police. - I'm going to. I just have to find Anna first. She's not answering. The police came by the office. Officer Malm. They were asking about Caesar Batanga. And then they searched our old files and documents. Do you know what they were looking for? Yes. Something I'd forgot about. Here. Can I borrow a jacket? Sure. What's on that tape, anyway? - Damn, you scared me, Louise. - Everyone is anxious to find it. - Are you going somewhere? - Can you play the tape? - You don't want to see it. - Please play the tape. If I play it... - You and Morgan. - I want to see it. Caesar Batanga. That's Morgan. - Turn it off. - He's sick, Louise. Just look at him. - Turn it off, I said. - Look at him! He filmed himself, he's a psychopath. Look at him! - I told you to turn it off! - I'm sorry. Louise, I need the tape, it's the only thing that can clear me. Understand? Louise... I need the tape, Louise. Did you know that Morgan has threatened to kill my family? Anna and Ebba. He's married and has children in Belarus. I'm sorry, but it's true. You're not a part of his future plans. You're just a tool, just like I am. And when he's done with me, you're next. I'm sorry, Louise. Help me. Please, help me. Give me the tape. My husband had a bank account with 100 million, but I can't get to it. I can't imagine you not having an offshore account. - Give me the money. - If you give me the tape... Don't you think the officers downstairs heard the shots? Give me the money. - What's going on? - He ran that way, towards the kitchen. That took forever. Anna. - Anna? - Where are you? - I'm with Fabian. Where are you? - The country house. Dad arranged for us to stay in Spain, I'm going there tomorrow with Ebba. - What are you doing? - What do you mean? What are you doing? I'm just trying to solve this. - Did you deceive Morgan? - What did you say? Did you deceive Morgan? - What are you asking? - I thought that Morgan was dead. - Me too. What are you asking? - Why did he show up now? I don't know. What do you want me to say? I don't know. I'm not the psychopath here. - Preben was shot. - What? I think that Preben is dead. I'm sorry. So much has happened. - We haven't had time to talk... - Where are you? - The country house. - Is Ebba there? No, she's with dad, she's sleeping there. You're not alone there, are you? Anna? Anna! Anna? Bring the access codes to H?rtuna. Did you bring the toiletry bag? - Yes. - Take it out. - It's in the back. - Open it. - What? - Open it. Listen to me... Louise has a video tape. I need you to get it. Louise? She was involved with Wilhelm's murder. What am I supposed to do? Just get the tape. I can't do it, Thomas. There has to be some other way. I need this tape. - I can't do anything illegal. - Get the fucking tape! Get it! Come on, I'm in a hurry. Come on! Where is the tape? Give me the tape! Where is it, Louise? I need a car at 25 Strandv?gen. A woman has cut open her arms. She's bleeding all over the place. Yes. Hold on. Just let me... No, it's both arms. What the...? Anna, stay calm. I'm here now. Take it easy. Take it easy, I'm getting you down. It's time, Thomas. Time to settle old debts. Okay? Your account number. Let Anna go first. - You have no say here! - Wait. Okay. 35-26-03-10... ...30-45. Access code? 26-24-58-26... ...39-65. - Last one? - Let Anna go first. Just choose - your wife or the money? - You'll kill us both when you have it. - I'll let her go. You're still the same. You love money more than you love your wife. Bastard! - I don't trust you. What's my guarantee? - Here it is. 25-11-25-86... ...11-25-86... ...11-45. Morgan. Morgan? Listen to me, Morgan. Morgan. No! Anna! Come on, Anna. Come on, Anna! Did you actually think that you could beat me? You damn... I'm sorry. I brought your clothes and these. Who's the reflection of? Who is that? Have you made any copies? No. - Are you sure? - I wouldn't dare. No one scares me as much as you. There was never a crisis. The finances are solid, the owners are pleased. Wilhelm's wife Louise has admitted complicity in her husband's murder. This clears my client of all these terrible charges... I've wondered if Wilhelm saw the whole tape. If it was his ace in the hole. One thing is certain, he knew my weak spot. But that's the point of weak spots. Everyone's got one. All you have to do is find it.
