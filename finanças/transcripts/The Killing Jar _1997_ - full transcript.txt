(tense eerie instrumental music) (rustling) (panting) - [Boy In Tie-Dye] Hey, Pete, come here. Danny, Michael! - Oh, man, I could've won. - Nah, I could beat you any day. (tense music) - What is it? - [Boy] It's a black widow. (tense eerie instrumental music) (jazzy instrumental music) (slow suspenseful instrumental music) (tinkling) (soft instrumental music) (tense instrumental music) - [Man] Honey, breakfast is ready! - [Woman] Okay, I'll be right there! (gentle instrumental music) - So I saw the car, but it was on the wrong side of the road, and its lights were on. - So what did you do? - Uh, kept going. - Well, I hope no one got hurt. - Honey, I figured it was probably a couple of teenagers, got the keys to the car and had a whole night to kill. - Well, I am glad you're back. This is too big of a house to be all alone by myself in. - Yeah? Well, you'll get used to it. You'll get used to this. (gentle instrumental music) (laughing) I'm sorry. But don't worry. I promise I'll be getting home earlier from now on. (sighs) - Good, that's real comforting. - I can hear him. - (chuckles) At two months, nice try, buddy. - No, I swear to God, I can, he's saying, he's going, he's going, he's going, please help me, let me out, I'm trapped, I'm trapped! - She is not, she is not trapped. She is safe and secure. (gentle instrumental music) - I gotta go to work. - No. Oh, come on, don't. What time should I see you there tonight? - Well, I'm not sure, in the old days the christenings used to be around sundown. - Okay, I'll see you then. (gentle instrumental music) (keys jingle) (sighs) - You know, you're gettin' to be pretty good at that. - Yes, I am. (machine rumbles) (speaks foreign language) - Hey, Cam. You got someone here to see ya, Mr. Aretto. - Tell him I'll be right with him. - What's up, Cameron? - Ah, it's probably just some new distributor with a complaint. Don't worry about it, I'll see him. (soft chattering in foreign language) (dog barks) - Well come on, Dick, turn off that boob tube, and check on that special order for Mrs. Sanford. Lord only knows how much intelligence has been sapped out of him. - It's all right, Martha, just let him take his time. - [News Anchor] We're found murdered in their station wagon early this morning, just south of Point Reyes. - Dick! - A truck driver discovered the bodies. - Mrs. Sanford is waiting patiently. Excuse me, I'm just gonna check and see what he's doing. Just a moment. (dog barks) - Live in Point Ray. - For goodness sakes. - Yeah, yeah, a terrible thing happened. A killing down at Point Rays, an entire family. - Oh my goodness. Oh my God, no. (tense music) - [Mrs. Sanford] Martha, is everything okay? - [Martha] I can't imagine it. Oh Lord, help us. - What happened? - A whole family was killed down Highway One at Point Reyes, a husband and a wife and two kids. - Oh my God, that's horrible, when? - Last night, same exact thing happened two weeks ago. - [Martha] Dick, stop scaring her. - What, newsman said it, Martha, not me. Third time it's happened in these parts, Belinis, then in Vertnis. Each time a family with little ones, chopped up like steaks at a cookout. - Dick Resigy, you shut your mouth right now. Damn news people, scarin' everyone! They should just let the police handle it. - Michael was there. (tense instrumental music) Well, I mean, he wasn't there. He was in the city last night. He got back late. - But Highway One is the only way home. - Get ahold of yourself, Martha. It's a long piece of road. - But he may have seen something. Mrs. Sanford, you should tell him to go and talk to the police. Who knows what he might have seen out there. Aren't I right, Dick? - Well, newsman did say they were strapped for witnesses. (tense instrumental music) - Well, he said he saw a car pulled over on the side of the road, but he-- - Martha's right, you never know about somethin' like this. (tense instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) - Twice a year, we pack the product of our labor into these crates and send it off into the world. That makes tonight special, and I'm glad you could all be here to share in it. However, I think you'd all agree that this date carries a particular significance, since it is the first vintage to be christened since Mrs. Sanford passed on. I honestly don't have any special words. Maybe her son can supply those for us. (soft chattering) - I know these past few years have been difficult. And I'll be honest with you, when I came back to Soletto a few months ago, I had no intention of staying. This didn't feel like my hometown anymore. Something was missing. (camera clicks) And Diane and I were packing our bags to leave when she turned to me and she said, uh, "So, who's taking over the family business?" And it hit me. I couldn't leave this place. Hey, a few months, it's not much, but we're still standing. And I bet my mom and dad are up there some place lookin' down on us sayin', "I can't believe that little shit is doing it without us." (chuckling) I want you all to know I'm not here to take their place. I'm here to take us back to what we were and what we've always been. A family. (clapping) - This is how it's done in Soletto. For 100 years, this is the way it's done. (wine trickles) As the soil absorbs the wine, so will the coming year be a good one. We will take home a bottle to our families. - Great! Another free bottle. When do we see a raise? - Shut up, Chajen. Lucky you still got a job. - No, it's all right, he's got a right. I've got some ideas on how to make this place more profitable, but you're gonna have to be patient, all right? Nothing's come together just yet. Thank you. (clapping) (tense music) (soft chattering) (tense music) (soft chattering) - Hey, Michael. - Hey. - So how'd it go in the city last night? - It was fine. - Just fine? - Yeah, they're nice people, the Japanese. - Well, I assume they made an offer. - Yeah, and I rejected it. Like I did last week and the week before. - Money like theirs is the kind of expansion this operation needs, put something in everyone's pocket. - It would mean the reigns would be in somebody else's hands, and that's not what my father envisioned for this place. - Come on, Michael. In the past five years, we've seen infestation increase and competition, a 10-fold jump in workman's' comp payments. Your father never had it this tough. But as a matter of fact, I was talkin' to a very smart young man who came by this morning. I asked him to stick around and have a chat with you. (tense eerie music) Very innovative ideas about expanding the operation while still maintaining-- - You're lookin' to sell the winery. I'm in for the long haul, Cameron. I thought you were, too. (tense instrumental music) - [Diane] It could've been us. - [Michael] It was an hour away from here. - And the one that happened two weeks ago was an hour and a half away, which means it's getting closer. And the police haven't been able to find out who's behind it either, and they've been searching for weeks and-- - Diane, enough. (slow tense instrumental music) (sighs) I'm sorry. It's just, people who go and pick up hitchhikers should know better. It could never happen to us, all right? Never. - There were children. I mean, how could anyone do that to children? - If someone ever tried that I'd, I'd kill 'em. (sighs) - I just thought that by moving here-- - Moving back to Soletto is the smartest thing we ever did, don't ya feel it? I mean, I've got my hands on my future here. - Our future. - Yes, our future. His future. - Hers. (chuckles) - Don't ya feel it, Diane? Are kids are gonna grow up in one of the last untouched landscapes in this country. I mean, this is it, Diane, this is where we belong. (humming) Oh! - Good morning. Oh, God, I'm sorry! - It's all right. It's just a scratch, happens all the time. See, it's nothin', it's not even bleeding. - Well, I promise not to bother you when you're shaving from now on. (tense instrumental music) (eerie instrumental music) (blood plops) - Okay, that's, uh, $1500 for the gas. (chuckles) You want me to check the oil for ya? - No, thanks. - Uh, I feel kinda guilty for not introducing myself to you before, 'cause you come in so often and all. I'm, I'm Pete Lawrence. - Diane Sanford. - Yeah. I know. Has Michael ever mentioned me? - No. - Shit, man. We were neighbors back in the old days, that's, uh, my folks' house is, like, half a mile down the road from you guys. - Oh, I've meet them. - Oh, yeah, my, my mom probably brought ya a pie, or fudge, or somethin' when you guys moved in, right? But, uh, me and Mike, I mean, we raised hell up in them hills. I mean, we were, we were good buddies. We were best friends, really. - He never told me. - That's funny how Mike hasn't come in here to say hi to me. I mean, there's only two service stations in the whole valley. Is he tryin' to avoid me or somethin', huh? Oh, you know, I'll bet he told ya how we used to call ourselves the Figaretto Four. Who came up with that ridiculous name, but it stuck somehow. Yeah, here it is. That's us, that's me. That's Michael, and the Evans boys Sean and Danny. Sean's the guy with the crooked front teeth. - That's cute. - Maybe it's too tough for him. What, with Sean and Danny gone like they are. Nothing's really ever been the same around here since those days. Maybe it's just too tough for him to see me. You think? - I really don't know anything about it. I'm sorry. - No. That's okay, I'm, I know, he's busy, but, uh, would you tell him that I said hello, and, and just tell him to come by sometime? I just wanna shoot the shit with him. - Well, I'll let him know. - Okay. (thuds) (engine rumbles) (groans) (jazz instrumental music) - Michael! Michael! You said you brought home a bottle of wine. Where is it? (jazz instrumental music) (eerie tense music) Michael! (jazz instrumental music) Michael? Michael? (jazz instrumental music) (eerie tense instrumental music) Michael? (gasps) I'm sorry. (jazz instrumental music) Good thing we don't have any neighbors. You keep playing the same song. - Yeah, it was Dad's old records. - Is anything wrong? - No. Did you mess with my stereo? - (chuckles) Are you kidding? I would never hear the end of it. - Come on, Diane, did you? Hmm? - Maybe I kicked up the bass a little bit. You can always turn it back down. Come on, don't change the subject on me. Is there anything bothering you? (sighs) - No, it's just work. The wine biz. - Ah, the wine biz. Met a guy named Pete Lawrence today. Wants you to come see him. - Oh, Pete, (chuckles). He's our village idiot. - Well that makes sense, seeing that he's a friend of yours. - (chuckles) I hardly knew him. - All I know is that he wants you to come down and talk with him. - Honey, why don't you go to the, uh, 76 station on Perfidilla from now on, okay? Petey was diagnosed as, I don't know, schizophrenic, or something. - He seemed harmless enough. - Well, I don't want ya near the guy. - All right, all right. Michael. - Hmm? - Did you see anything that night? - Sleep, I gotta get up early tomorrow. - Come on, talk to me. - (sighs) What, Diane? About what? - Martha said you should go to the police. Dick agreed. - You told Dick and Martha that I drove by there? - Well, yeah, and they said they were begging for witnesses, and. - Fuckin' fantastic. Now the whole town's gonna be all over my back. Be a good citizen, go to the police. - Well you should, you should go to the police and tell them what you saw. - (sighs) All right, Diane, for the last time, all I saw was a car parked on the side of the road. As far as I'm concerned, it was empty. Why would the cops give a shit about that? - Oh, come on, you're so full of crap. This is what's been bothering you for the past few days. Come on, take an hour out of your day tomorrow, and go down to the police station and just tell them. I was on Highway One last night, and I didn't see anything except a parked car. So you'll get it off your chest, and the police will have a tiny scrap of information and everybody will be happy. - I don't care about making everyone happy. I care about you. So for you, I'll. (sighs) - Thank you. I promise I won't bother you about it ever again. - No, no, it's unfathomable that he missed it. There's no way! He thinks it was around midnight, not certain of the time, but certain of the vehicle, a dark blue station wagon, which we know is the Wade's car, a dark blue Ford Wagon. - Undoubtedly the Wade's car. - Flash forward a couple of hours, and along comes our illegal alien, I don't know nothing, vegetable truck driver, Santos, at 2 a.m. - Just after. - Just after 2 a.m., he comes across the same scene only this time there's body parts all over the road. We got a head here, a leg there, torso over behind a bush, what have ya. He actually has to swerve to avoid hitting these pieces of Wade family. - So? - So, how long does it take to cut up a family of four? - Ah, come on, I'm trying to eat lunch here. - Keep up with me here, Bernie. As far as I'm concerned, we can safely say that between the hours of midnight and 2 a.m. Monday morning the killer dismembers his victims, a two-hour-killing window. And this guy Sanford, Sanford must've been there right before it happened or even as it happened. The wagon was there, the family must've been in it, or near it at least. I'm betting that our man in the glass booth knows more than he knows he knows. (tense instrumental music) - Come on, English, Pestone, English. - He was there. He was there, maybe not standing watching, but he drove past. At the very least, Michael Sanford was a witness to the scene of a murder, maybe he witnessed a murder without even knowin' it. Let's give it a shot. Call Garret, see what he thinks. - Essentially, the eyes are a sort of a camera, which you can figure the brain is a roll of film. Everything we see, feel, touch, is stored for an indefinite period of time. The key is being able to retrieve it. - Stop. I'm not gonna sit here and have a pocket watch dangled in front of my face, and have this clown tell me I'm getting very sleepy. No, no way. - You know, I've got three families being stored in a meat locker in sandwich bags. How do ya feel about that? - I understand your skepticism, Mr. Sanford, but let me tell you about a discovery that was made some time ago by a man named Milton Erickson. Given the proper incentive, you can remember verbatim your seventh grade term paper, the fine print on a box of Wheaties. And that sounds incredible, doesn't it? Our minds are bombarded constantly by words and images, and it's primary function is to edit out what we don't need. Right now, my voice, my face, are being received by your conscious memory, but the tick of the clock, the pattern on Detective Morris' tie, sounds from under the door, the smell of coffee and doughnuts, a thousand bits of information are going directly into your subconscious where they will remain for the rest of your life. The human brain is like a super computer, Mr. Sanford. It remembers 5,000 pieces of information at every glance and remembers them all. (tense instrumental music) - So, you think I saw something out there? - Well, I'd like a chance to find that out. - Yeah? Well, you're nuts. I slowed down and looked, man, it was dark. There wasn't, there wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I was driving too fast to see jack shit. - Well, you were close, right? For a moment at least, as close as you are to me, what if something was going on that you couldn't substantially detect, fleeting, barely noticeable, peripheral? That information is locked up inside you. Let me extract it. - For what? I'm not gonna testify against something I didn't even see. - Hey, what are you afraid of? We're asking you to go under hypnosis, because all of Sonoma County could benefit. Worse case scenario, it doesn't work. So what's the problem? (slow tense instrumental music) - You're not gonna make me bark like a dog or somethin', are ya? - Trust me, Mr. Sanford, you have nothing to worry about. (owl hoots) (howling) (insects chirp) - Michael? (footsteps tap) Michael, is that you? What are you doing? - I was out, went for a drive. - A drive, where? - Around. Couldn't sleep. - [Diane] Are you nervous about tomorrow? - No, not at all. - Yes, you are, but you'll feel better once you've done it. - Actually, I'm kinda glad I woke you up. (gentle instrumental music) (chuckles) (gentle instrumental music) (eerie tense instrumental music) The sign says Point Reyes. There's an arrow. - Okay, where are you now? - Coming around the corner. - How fast are you traveling? - 45, 46, 47. - [Garret] You're moving pretty quick. - Yes, 49, 50. - Is there a clock on the dashboard? - Yes. - [Garret] What time does it say? - Three minutes to 12. - You're moving pretty fast. Do you see anything else? - [Michael] I do. - [Garrett] What is it? - [Michael] Light. (eerie tense music) - How fast are you going now? - 46, 42, 39. - I want you to go slower, Michael. I want you to go as slow as you possibly can. - [Michael] It's a blue station wagon. - [Garret] You're looking at it very carefully. You're passing it very slowly. - It's close, I can touch it. - No, don't touch it. Just look at and tell me what you see. - It's a Ford Taurus. License number 2GKI322. - What else about the car? What else do you see? (eerie tense music) - Blood. (eerie tense music) - Where's the blood? All right, Michael, what else do you see, what else? Are there any people? - I can't see everything, I, I can just, I can see a car door is open. There's something there. - [Garret] What is it, Michael? - I-I don't know. - Try, try and see it, you can see it. (crying) (glass shatters) - There's light, it's, it's bright, and, and, and the sun is in my eyes. - What is he saying? It was midnight. - High beams. Listen to me, Michael, listen to me. Do you see any people? (eerie tense music) (clattering) - Children. - The two children? (tense instrumental music) - Oh my God. Oh my God, there's someone there. - Is it a man? - Yes, I think it is. (eerie tense instrumental music) - Can you describe him? - I can't, I can't. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. (tense eerie instrumental music) (screaming) It's okay, Michael, it's okay, sit down. That's right. Okay. (crying) Sit down. You saw the face. Can you describe it? - Was he white, black, tall, or short, what? - Shh. You know the face? Have you seen the face? Could you describe it? All right. All right, Michael. (tense instrumental music) Your husband in effect knows who the killer is. He has a picture in his head, a sort of a still life depicting the scene of the crime, a face, all we have to do is find it. - This house was everything to Dad, much more so than the winery or the vineyard, or the town even. He was always working on it, watering the yard, or building something. (gentle instrumental music) He really loved it here, you know? This was his whole life. (gentle instrumental music) - How old were you when he died? - 13. I was 13 years old. - What exactly did he die of? - Car accident. Killed him and Sean Evans and, (sighs) it was real bad. (eerie tense music) - I'm sorry, okay? You still love me? - Huh? - Nothing. (solemn instrumental music) (fleshy thud) (yelling) - Go, come on, kick his butt! (yelling) - Get him, get him! (yelling) (fleshy thuds) - Get him, get him! (yelling) (thuds) - Come on! (yelling) - Up, you, up! - Goddammit, let me through, let me through! Hey, hey! What the hell's goin' on here? - Get outta here, Vasqual, that's a day's pay! You, too, Chajen. This is the second time this month, and I'm not gonna take it anymore, you understand? (spits) Go on, get! All right, show's over! - Come on, show's over. - Everybody, back to work. Back to work. A good day to work. - What can I do? I mean, what in the hell can I do? Cameron, please, I'm asking you. - Well, a buck or two an hour might be a good place to start. - I can't do that right now. Have any of you people considered that the world is drinking less premium wine these days? Folks don't like pluckin' down 25 bucks on a quart of vino, okay? I apologize! - Great, bring on the big machines and we're clinging to this old tradition family operation! Don't mean a damn thing anymore. You want my advice, right? Well, my advice is real simple. The offers are coming in. You got the Japanese, you got the Mondaves, you got Mr. Aretto. Take one of the offers, Michael. Take one while you still can. - I can't sell this place. - Damn it! Damn you, Michael! Look, one day a long time ago when I was small, my father came home from the autumn crush, seemed like he'd been gone for weeks, and I didn't understand. See, this vineyard was not a great thing to me. It took my father away. One night I was so upset, I just started cryin'. He came to me and he picked me up and he said, "Son, this vineyard is our life here, "and one day we'll all own a piece of it, "and Mr. Sanford's gonna take care of all of us forever." These men, these men all have children, Michael. They're hungry, so what do you expect? - I expect this town to give me a chance. - Well then give them a chance. I think you oughta talk to these buyers. Look at all the options. Mr. Aretto had a reasonable offer. - Listen, I don't want you negotiating on my behalf for anything. - Michael-- - Damn it, I said no, and that's it! What are you not understanding here? I don't want you goin' behind my back, and I don't care what kind of resentment I get from you or this whole fuckin' town! I'm gonna do what I need to do. You people wanna kick me around for the rest of your lives, fine. I guess that's just what happens when someone dies around here. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - The hell you don't. He would've wanted it this way! (tense unsettling music) - [Boy] Michael, please! (tense unsettling music) Michael! - Michael. Michael. (camera clicks) - Stop it, stop it! - Stop what, I was just taking a picture. - I don't understand. I am doing the best that I can, Cam, he's going behind my back, I need time! I need more time! What else do they want from me? When is this gonna stop? It's gotta stop! - Stop, you, you stop! Look at me. Come on, look at me. (solemn instrumental music) - This is absolutely normal. You're receiving some confusing messages from your subconscious mind, memories, nightmares, things you've tucked away. It's nothing to worry about. - Nothing to worry? He's having goddamned hallucinations. - I am aware of that. You have to understand that this is good. It's what we want and need. - It's the face. He looked right in my eyes. - Do you wanna go back under? - No. (tense music) - I just want the guy caught. I wanna sleep again. - I understand. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic music) - Jesus! You scared me. How long have you been standing there? - What ya wrokin' on? - A collage for my book, what do ya think? - I like it, it's nice. - Well, that's a rave review. I'm not through with it yet. I've gotta go back down there tomorrow to fill in those blank spots. The thing that really pisses me off though is that I was gonna set up these shots using my instant camera, but the things gone up and disappeared on me. I don't suppose you've seen it, now have you? - No, sorry. I'm gonna go for a drive. - What time is it? - I don't know, midnight, one. I'll be back in a bit. - Will you drive past where you saw the accident? - It wasn't an accident. It was a murder. Someone murdered them. - Will you see the-- - Yes. Probably. Always. (tense rhythmic music) (kids laugh) (camera clicks) - [Radio DJ] How and why such relentless carnage. (tense rhythmic music) (kids chatter) (camera clicks) (kids chatter) - Hey, Diane, is that your husband? - Yeah, it is. Hey, you, what's up? - Nothing really, just thought I'd stop by and say hello. You know, I used to go to school here. (whistle blows) - All right, you guys, that's enough. Slow it down. - Honey, why don't you let me finish up here, and I'll see you at home, okay? I'm almost done. - Okay. (screaming) (tense music) - Stop it, you guys, stop it right now! (screaming) (tense instrumental music) (yelling) (eerie tense music) (glass shatters) - Wait a goddamn second. Hey, get the hell away from them. - Michael? - Get the hell away from them, do you hear me? Get away from 'em! - What, what's wrong? - What's a matter? - You know what's the matter, you know what's the matter, and I know, too, motherfucker, I saw you. - Michael, what are you saying? - Just call Detective Pestone, all right? I've seen your face, you son of a bitch, I've seen you before! - Michael, let's just talk about this. Let's just please - Michael, let's just settle down. - Talk about this okay? - We're all a little confused here. We'll go inside, we can talk about it. - I've seen you face! I know you! - Hey, hang on! - What the fuck are you doing? - I think it's time that you leave now, Mr. Sanford. - I checked out Stuart Weissman, you know, just to be sure. He, he was arrested in Berkeley for protesting a certain war several years ago, but other than that he's got an airtight alibi. - Don't waste your time, Sheriff Foley. - Well, Michael must've just thought he was someone else. You know, I-I-I'm sure your friend, uh, Dr. Garret, can shed some light on that. But, uh, for me, Mrs. Sanford. - Diane. - Diane, uh, I don't know you too well. I knew your husband when he was in the crib, but he went away for so long, you know, hell, must be 20 years at least. Goddammit, you know, I remember he was a good kid. Just, uh, don't expect too much, that's all. This is a small town, small talk, small minds. - You don't have to pretend with my anymore, Sheriff Foley. I know what's going on. People treat us differently here. I mean, even though Michael was born here, even though this town exists because of his family's winery, they don't want us here anymore. I mean, we're outsiders. All because of some shit that nobody wants to talk about. Stuff that happened years and years ago. - Well, you're talkin' to the one man in Soletto who has yet to pick a grape, but, yes, I'd say there's definitely some leftover tension hangin' around here. - So then what gives, Foley? What happened? - People had a lot of hope for this town, and when Michael's father died, it seemed like a lot of those dreams just disappeared. But it, it's not my business. If Michael hasn't told you, then I'm sure he has his reasons. - All that and now this. I can't imagine what people will be saying. - Well, I'm here to protect and serve you, ma'am, but understand, I serve them, too. Now, just stay out of sight for a while. This will pass. I promise ya. Ah, d-d-don't, don't bother, I-I-I know the way out. (tense instrumental music) - Stop, stop. Stop, stop the car! Stop the car, someone might need help back there! - You stopped the car? - Yes. - You've gotten out of the car? - Yes. - What are you doing now? (tense music) - Walking toward it. It's quiet, I don't see anything. Hey, the light's right in my eyes, cut it out. (crashing) (glass shatters) - High beams from the blue wagon? - No, sun. (glass shatters) - And what do you see? What do you see, Michael? (laughing) - [Michael] Children. (chuckles) They're laughing. I can hear them laughing. - That's impossible. (eerie tense music) (blood splatters) (tense music) You must see something, Michael, what is it? (rustling) (tense music) (swishing) (crunching) - I can't stay here, I have to go. - [Boy] Help me, Michael! - Please, Michael, tell me what you see. (tense music) - Start the car! - Michael! (eerie tense music) - [Boy] Help, Michael, Michael. (eerie tense music) - [Michael] Gotta help me, Michael. Please, Michael, help me, please. - [Boy] Michael, Michael! - Help me, Michael! Michael, Michael! (sobbing) - Michael, what do you see? Wait. I know you saw something, someone. (crying) - [Michael] Nothing. - We were so close. - No, please. No, please. I just wanna go home. I'll be fine. Just take me home. - You remember how he said he never got outta the car? Well. forget that, not only did he get outta the car, but he walked back toward the crime scene. - That's bullshit. - What do you mean it's bullshit? Sanford said it himself. - [Morris] So what did he see? - It's all mixed up, but according to this, he got halfway there when a case of the creeps set in, hightailed it back to his Rover and flew. - So it's more of the same. - No, it's not more of the same. Along the way, he heard voices and laughter, kids laughin'. - They were all dead. - So we thought, but he says that was blinded by a light of some sort. Garret asks if he means high beams, and Sanford says no. Sun. - If he was blinded, how did he see the exposed face? - Damn it, damn it, damn it. If any of this came out of real live conscious interrogation, then we'd have something. But what the hell is this? Hypnosis with no physical evidence. DA will laugh us out of his office. - Why don't we just pinch this guy, and hold him till the next family fertilizes the field? - Can't do it, Bernie. Complete waste of time. - What do you mean we can't do it, Jake? You think these bodies are just fallin' out of nowhere? - Whoever this is, they don't kill like they want to. They kill like they have to. There's no evidence that anyone was there. There's no evidence of a struggle and no motive either. It's almost like they don't know why they're doin' it. (sighs) Bernie, we can't hold Michael Sanford. We can't hold anybody. (gun bangs) - Still works. All right, you can put five rounds in the hole, one in the chamber, then ya rack it like this. (gun clicks) It's ready to go. All right. Diane, please, just put it up to your shoulder, to right about here. All right, then you make sure it's pumped, you take the safety off, then you just squeeze the trigger. Now, it's gonna kick a little bit, Diane, but I think you can handle it. (gun bangs) Excellent, good! Good! Although next time you shoot, you gotta pump and make sure you got another round in there, all right? Okay, Diane? - Michael, we should just go away. (gun clicks) - I think I'm gonna put this in the front hall closet. Now, you remember that, you make note of it. - Back to Spain. Remember how great that was? Where we met. - Diane. Are you gonna remember that the shotgun is in the front hall cabinet? (tense instrumental music) Honey. (gentle instrumental music) Come on, I wanna show you something. (gentle instrumental music) (tense instrumental music) - Oh, I didn't know this was out here. (gentle instrumental music) The Figaretto Four? - Yeah, it's our tree house. - Let's go. - Up the tree, no, no way. - Oh, come on, I can climb up that high. - Honey, it's dangerous. Pete, he once found a black widow spider up there, put it in a jar and watched it die. (tense instrumental music) - Pete? - Yeah, Lawrence. Him and me and Sean and Danny Evans, Figaretto Four, I told you that, didn't I? - [Diane] I thought you said-- - My hook and ladder 242. I always wondered where this thing wound up. (tense instrumental music) - It's not the only ancient artifact out here. You boys started out on the hard stuff pretty early. - Fuckin' punks! Come out here and great drunk all night long. - I've never heard anyone. - I have. Talkin' and playin' music and stuff. (bottle thuds) I hear them. Come on, let's get outta here. (tense instrumental music) (wind blows) - Michael? (wind blows) (clicking) (tense instrumental music) (door clicks) (footsteps thud) Michael? (thudding) What are you doing? (tense instrumental music) (beeping) (tense instrumental music) - [Woman] 911, could you state your emergency, please? - Were you calling me? (beeps) - Of course I was calling you. Shit, you scared the hell out of me. What are you doing? - I went for a drive and washed the car. Christ. - I spoke with Dr. Feterly today, and he says he wants to see you as soon as you can free up some time and he said he'd even come up here if you want. - I don't know about that, sweets, I'm pretty busy these days. You know, I gotta squeeze those grapes, gotta make money for those grape pickers. - Don't you think it would be important to talk with someone besides Dr. Garret about your problem? - I don't have a problem. It's their problem, I'm the solution. They need me to find this creep, right? Well, I'm their ace in the hole. (thunder rumbles) (Diane gasps) - [Diane] That, that's blood. - Of course it's blood, Diane. Of course it is. I didn't wanna tell you, 'cause I though you'd cry your goddamn eyes out. You see, Diane, we're livin' in the country, and in the country you gotta be tough, you gotta learn how to be strong. You gotta learn how to deal with a little roadkill every once in a while, okay? Think you can handle that, Diane? Huh? (dramatic instrumental music) (thunder rumbles) (rain plops) (tense instrumental music) (engine rumbles) Diane! Stop, don't go! - Get away from me! - I'm sorry! So sorry, I don't know why I acted like that. Please, just get out of the car. - Listen, I am not gonna take this shit anymore! You understand? Just get away from me! - Look, I know you must think I'm crazy, but I swear to you, I swear to you, I'm not. (tense music) (rain plops) I know how I must look to you. Diane, I need you, please. Please, Diane, stay. (tense instrumental music) - Listen to me. I don't think you're crazy. What I do think is that you're treating me like shit. All I wanna do is help. Tell me what's going on. (thunder rumbles) (tense music) (soft chattering) - [Officer] Just bag what you get. - [Officer] Yeah. (soft chattering) - Here we go. - Thanks. - [Officer] Bring the flashlight over here. (thunder rumbles) - [Officer] I see it, I got it. (soft chattering) (thunder rumbles) - Foley, what brings you to the party? - It's barely two miles outside my jurisdiction, Pestone. - Two miles? - Yep. - It's gettin' closer. I'd start keepin' that gun loaded, if I were you. - It'd help if you boys started usin' our tax dollars in some constructive way. - We're tryin', Sheriff, contrary to popular belief. - [Officer] Okay, put it in the wagon. - Need I ask? - Same, same, Mommy, Daddy, two kids, eyes poked out with a sharp instrument, fingers cut off the right hand-- - All right, all right. - It's not all right. This motherfucker is carvin' up kids, goddammit. I want his corpse strung out on a meat hook. - Hey, Jake. I found another one. - There's somethin'? - Same was found at the other crime scenes. It's the first thing that comes out of an instant camera when ya load it. - Tag it. - Gotta get outta here, Sheriff. (tense music) (thunder rumbles) (doorbell rings) - Foley, Ladies, good morning, what's going on? - Is, uh, Michael home? - Uh, no. - Uh, ya sure, uh, his car's in the driveway. - Oh, it's not running well. He got a lift to work this morning. - Ask her. - Oh, come on, Katie, uh, we'll deal with this later. - Ask her or I will. - Uh, Diane, we need to know where your husband was last night. - With me. - [Foley] All night? - Yes. - You're sure? - Yes, I'm sure. I wouldn't want someone I care about be running around in times like these. - Tell that to my son. He's still afraid to go to school. She's lying. - I'm what? - I saw Michael drive past our place last night, alone. - And what are you doing, sitting around in your window all day? - With a shotgun in my lap. - I think I've heard about enough, Katie. Mr. Sanford says her husband was with her all through the night and that's the way it is. Come on, ladies, stop all the poutin' and let's, uh, let it be. - So what the hell was that all about? - What are we gonna do, Michael? - I'm pretty hungry, how 'bout some brunch? - These people, these people don't want us here anymore. They're tired of it. - Tired of what? Honey, the men and women of this town are a bunch of lonely, old losers who don't have anything better to do with their lives than to worry about things that don't concern them, so fuck 'em all. - Where did you get all this contempt? These are, these are your people, Michael, these are your friends. - My friends? Yeah. (chuckles) So where were they, where were they when I needed them? - I don't understand what you mean. - You see this? This is for luck. Miserable bastards. Luck! They don't think I'm out there slicin' up these families, oh, hell no, they'd send a lynch mob here. I am bad luck, Diane, and so are you, bad luck. They blame all their problems on me. They want me out. They want, they wanna run this place themselves. - Wait a second, this is not about money, and this is not about some superstition. - You're acting like you understand. You don't know anything about this place. Three months, and you think you've got it all figured out? - Your family built this winery. Your family built this town. Soletto has existed for a 100 years because of you. The problem is that they don't like you. Your mom, your dad-- - My dad was a god to these people. - We've gotta get out of here, Michael. Listen to me, for a little while at least. It can be like, like when we first met, you and me together, we knew we could, we could make it together. - No, no, no! No, you don't, no, no, no, no, no. No, I am staying here. Until he tries to take me out, I am staying here. He wants a fight, I'm right here, I'm not leavin'! Where are my keys? Where are my car keys? - I don't know. - Where are my keys! - I don't know! (tense music) - You lifted 'em off me, didn't you? You've gotten better and better with your little tricks, and now you can do it without me even knowing. (tense instrumental music) You've been spying on me, haven't you, Diane? - Spying on you? I haven't been spy-- - Come here. - [Diane] Let go of me! Let go of me! Get! (keys jingle) (shattering) (dramatic music) - Are you against me, Diane, hmm? Are you against me? (tense music) Now, I am going to see my parents now. It'll be a nice little reunion. Mommy and Daddy and their wonderful prodigal son. (crying) (door thuds) (tense instrumental music) - I was so excited about moving back here, you know? Settling down, finding some continuity. We'd been on the road for such a long time, Michael, especially you. You have to go home. Resolve the things that kept you away all these years. Anyway, I need some time out for myself to, to sort this out in my head. I'll be at the Queen Anne in San Francisco. Here, here's the number if you wanna call. Pete? - Mrs. Sanford, no, please, okay, wait, wait, don't, don't. I'm fine, I'm just, I'm not gonna hurt you. - What are you doing here? I thought you were Michael, I thought. - What am I doing here? No, Michael, I haven't seen Michael since you guys came back into town. 'Cause he don't visit his friends no more. (tense music) You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like when everybody treats you like you don't exist no more. Like, have all your friends taken away from ya, just like that. And Michael Sanford was my best friend! (tense music) We, we had all kinds of things going up on that property of yours. We had tree forts and secret stingray bike ramps and indoor hide-and-seek. We were the Figaretto Four. I-I remember who it was that gave us that name, too. It was Michael's dad, 'cause, uh, we used to play around in the fig trees out by the fort. Once I was playin' out there, and I caught this black widow spider. - And you put it in a jar and watched it die. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it died. Finally. So much the better though, really. Sean and Danny, they were so scared of that thing, you know? And, uh, Michael, Michael said that it was, uh, torture, you know, to keep it in there, just toyin' with it while it struggled to survive. We were 13 years old that year, and, uh, Michael's dad decided to take the Figaretto Four on a fishing trip down to Tomales Bay, but, uh, I got sick that day, and I couldn't go. So it was just the three of them. Just Michael, Danny, and Sean. Can you imagine what that was like? Huh? In a matter of hours, I went from havin' three of the best friends in the whole world, to havin' none. (tense music) (jazz instrumental music) - Ketchup. - Ketchup who? - Michael. - Ketchup with me! - Did you bring that bay we bought? - It's in the back. (laughing) - Here, I got one, I got one. - What? - Are we almost there? - Ketchup! - Yeah, son, we're almost there. (laughing) Hey, hey, settle down, you guys. (jazz instrumental music) - Whoa. - Hey, what ya doin'? That one's mine. - Michael, no! Michael! - Mr. Sanford, look out! (tires squeal) (horn honks) (yelling) (tires squeal) (horn honks) (yelling) (tires squeal) (clattering) (yelling) (thudding) (glass shatters) (jazz instrumental music) (crashing) (soft jazz instrumental music) - Michael, help me! Help me, Michael! Help me, please! Michael! - I understand now. Your father gone, Sean Evans gone. What happened to Danny and Mr. And Mrs. Evans, did they move away? (gentle music) The town suffered, and your mom took over the winery. Come on, don't hide from me anymore, I am your friend. Above anything else, that's what I am. - I didn't know what to do. I was in shock, I just walked away. When it was all over, my mother couldn't deal with it, so she sent me away to boarding school. I had questions. (gentle instrumental music) I had things that I needed explained. No one took my hand, said, Michael, this is why you acted like that. This is why it's not your fault they're gone. (gentle instrumental music) So I jut put it away. Around here maybe it's bad luck to even talk about it. - It's over now. It's all over. (gentle instrumental music) (birds chirp) - From here to here, from here to here. They'll be nowhere near our operation. We won't even see them. - And this is what, a kind of, uh-- - It's a lease. See, Amatsu pays us x-amount of dollars to lease the land for 10 years. After that, we either renegotiate or we send 'em packin'. We're the landlords. - Yeah, but, lease, hell it's probably just peanuts. - The amount we agreed to has more zeros than I've ever seen. - It's just, it sounds a little too good. So where's all this money goin'? - [Michael] To the stockholders, of course. - We don't have any. - Oh, yes, we do, the employees. With my dad's original group ownership plan back in effect, we all get a piece. - So it's all for real? - Cam, this is what I was talkin' about. This is what my dad would've wanted. I just needed some time to make it work. - So, I guess I better call this Aretto fella in. Tell him to take his offer elsewhere. - I think you should. (chuckles) - Oh, it's all good. Yeah, well, say hi to Evan and Shelly for me. Okay. Yeah, I got it right here. The, uh, serial number is, hello? Hello? (clicking) Hello? Goddammit. I paid that bill. I paid that bill. That's a check in the mail, that's what that is. (tense instrumental music) Well, look who it is. You finally come back to say hello. (dramatic music) (groans) (tools clatter) (gasping) (tense music) - Ah, shit. Michael! (engine rumbles) Bandages, bandage. There you are. What the hell are you doing in here? Sheriff, you have to come. - [Foley] Diane, what's the matter? - Please, you have to come right away. - [Foley] What's the matter, what's happened? - I'll show you when you get here. Please, hurry! - [Foley] Yeah, I'm on my way. (beeps) (tense music) - [Micheal] Honey! (water sprays) Where are you? - Just a minute, I'm, I'm in the shower! (knocking) - [Michael] Let me in, honey. (knocking) (tense instrumental music) Let me in, honey, unlock the door. (tense dramatic music) - Oh, shit. - You all right? (tense rhythmic music) Diane! - I'll be right there, honey. (tense rhythmic music) - [Michael] Hey. - Thank you. - What's up, hmm? - Nothing, I just had to take a shower. I have to get dressed. - You found it. You found it. - Michael, no, I. (camera clicks) (chuckles) I forgot something downstairs. - Hey, honey! Diane? (siren wails) (door thuds) What's that? Diane, what in the fuck is happening here? (tense instrumental music) (dramatic music) What are you doing? What is this? (gun clicks) (siren wails) (tense music) Diane. - (crying) How could you? How could you? - I don't know what, who could've. (sirens wail) (tense music) (eerie tense music) (tense music) - What the hell is goin' on? Yes, Detective Pestone. I'm tellin' you, I got him right here, yeah. I got Michael Sanford, and I've got the evidence. I've got the whole megillah. Well, it's not that I don't want you to hurry on down. It's, you know, all right, uh, yeah. Bye. - Foley. Foley! - What is it, Michael? - Something's wrong, something's wrong with this. - Yeah, all right, Michael. Someone will be here shortly to help sort the whole thing out. - Please, Foley, I'm tellin' you there's somethin' wrong here. - Michael, ya need to calm down. - Please. - Come on, Michael, just sit down. - Please, listen to me! - Come on, Michael, what the hell are ya doin'? - Listen to me! Foley, I need your help! - Don't do this, Michael, don't make it worse! - [Man] Did I come at a bad time? - Um. Can I, can I help ya? - I'm here to see Michael Sanford. - You from the Santa Rosa PD? Hell, you guys are quick! - The police force? No. - Well I know ya from somewhere, don't I? - I-I don't think so. - Well, you've been around town awhile, right? I-I think I may have seen ya around. - I've been staying at the motel for the past few weeks, tryin' to make a deal with the local vineyard. You're an observant man, Sheriff. - Well, you know, it's my job. It's funny, I swear I know you from somewhere else. Are you from these parts originally? - Well, Sheriff Foley, I have to say, I'm very impressed. - Then I'm right, you're a local. - I used to be. (tense music) My folks moved us away when I was very small after the accident. (tense instrumental music) I go by Mr. Aretto. - Aretto. Strange, uh, I, I, I don't recall the name. - Well, Sheriff, you can call me whatever you like, Aretto, Evans, Figaretto, it's all the same. - Listen, I'm, I'm a little mixed up. Why are you here to see Michael? - Foley. - Well, Sheriff, it's, uh, it's like this. - Foley! - Goddammit, Michael, I told you to calm down. - Foley, watch out! (eerie dramatic music) (body thuds) - Hi, Michael. How you doin' in there? (tense eerie music) I think it's so great that we could finally get together again after all these years. (tense instrumental music) (clanging) It's important to stay in touch, don't ya think? (tense instrumental music) - Danny Evans. (eerie music) (laughing) (clanging) - Shh! (tense instrumental music) And what's really great is how well you're doing with yourself. That is a beautiful woman. - Oh my God, Danny. Look, listen to me. - Sit down. (tense instrumental music) How's it feel in there, Michael? How does it fill to be inside the killing jar? - Danny, wait a second, wait a second. - Let me finish my sentence, goddammit! That is so fucking rude, Michael! (tense instrumental music) - Danny, please, I, I-I'm so-- - Don't say that. Don't tell me you're fucking sorry, because I don't wanna hear it. Do you have any idea what it feels like to have pain with every breath? I mean, all the time, and when you do finally get to fall asleep, you still feel it, even in your dreams. I'm talking about years, Michael. See, I don't think you have any idea. (tense instrumental music) You left me trapped, bleeding, in the back seat of that car, waiting to burn. Help me, Michael! This is how ya left me, Michael. You can't even look at it. You can't even look at what you did! So don't tell me that you're fucking sorry, 'cause I don't wanna fucking hear it! It makes me sick! (tense instrumental music) - What can I do? - Oh, thanks for offering, Michael. That means so much to me. - Please, what do you want? Tell me what you want. (tense instrumental music) - Everything you've got. Everything you've got. (tense instrumental music) That's what I'm gonna get. - Danny, no, Danny! (tense instrumental music) Diane. (tense instrumental music) (glass shatters) (tense instrumental music) Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Help me! (tense instrumental music) (yelling) (clattering) Danny, I'm gonna fucking kill you! You fucker! (tense instrumental music) (gasping) (doorbell rings) - Yes? What is it? - [Danny] Uh, Diane? - I don't know you. - I know you don't, I'm, I'm Tim Lawrence from the Soletto Sheriff's Office. - I thought Foley was the only-- - [Danny] I've been on loan to the Santa Rosa PD until now, help out with the recent problems. That's why I'm here, ma'am. - Well, I can't answer any questions right now. - [Danny] Well, I won't ask ya any. I just need to take a quick look at the house. It won't take long. - Please, come back another time. (tense instrumental music) - Foley. (tense instrumental music) Foley. Foley. - [Michael] Pete? - It's funny, 'cause you know I was just down the road at my folks' house when I got the call. - Your Pete's brother? - Yeah, uh, you must know him from the filling station. Yeah, he's my little bro. - Mike, fuck, man. (gasping) Danny. - Pete, ah, Pete. - Well, I can't answer any questions right now, Officer Lawrence. - Please, call me Tim. (gasping) - Pete, Pete, listen to me. Listen to me. You've gotta help me, you've gotta get me outta here. Danny's on his way to Diane. (gasping) - Okay. (tense instrumental music) - Boy, this house sure brings it all back. We used to play all kinds of games here. I know every hiding place in it. Hell, I could still find my way around here in the dark. (tense dramatic music) - Mike, I don't see any keys, man. (tense music) - Yeah, this house sure knows how to keep a secret. - I don't know what you mean. - Secrets, Diane. This house is packed with 'em. (dramatic music) (clattering) - It's locked, right? (tense instrumental music) Now it's not. See, that's what makes this house of yours so special, Mrs. Sanford. Things like that. (tense instrumental music) - It's good to see ya, Mike. - Come on, Pete, you gotta stick with me here. - Are you sure there's nothing I can do for ya? Get ya some wood for the fire? It's gonna be a cold night. - Apply pressure, come on. Push down, apply pressure. - I missed you, man. I really missed you. Go to Diane. Leave, take my truck. Yeah. - I need you to hang on. (groans) Pete, come on, Pete, are ya with me? - Yeah, I'm here, man. Go, go, get goin', I'm okay. - Michael said something about a tree house in his confession. The sheriff wanted me to come over and check it out for evidence. - How long is this gonna take? - Just take a minute, and then I'll be outta your hair. Believe me, I know what you're goin' through here. (dramatic music) - What the fuck is this? (dramatic instrumental music) (tires squeal) (horn honks) (dramatic music) (horn honks) (tires squeal) Tell me that ambulance is on the way. Yeah, Michael Sanford, call the highway patrol and Diane Sanford, get 'em out there right now. Looks like he's on his way back to the house. Tell 'em suspect is armed and dangerous, extremely dangerous. (dramatic instrumental music) - Hang in there. (gasping) - Michael. - We know, we know, we're gonna get him. - No. - We're gonna get him. Just hang in there. What? - Not Michael. (tense instrumental music) - Diane! Diane! (dramatic instrumental music) Diane! (dramatic instrumental music) Diane! (dramatic instrumental music) Diane! Diane! (tense instrumental music) Oh my God. (tense instrumental music) - We used to have a lot of fun in that old tree house. Actually, my brother fell out of there once, broke his arm. - Pete's a nice guy. - Sean. I mean, it wasn't my brother that got hurt. It was Sean Evans, I just got mixed up. (tense instrumental music) (tapping) Well, well, look at this. Michael used to have a great time with this old thing. - What is it? - A killing jar. I know it sounds sadistic, but you know kids, right? Yeah, Michael used to love to watch a spider trapped inside there. He'd spend hours watching them die. I know we were just kids, and I probably shouldn't say this, but Michael just never seemed to give much of a damn about anything but himself. (dramatic music) (thuds) - Michael, no! (gun clicks) - Diane, get outta here. Don't you move, or I swear I'll blow your fuckin' head off. - Stay calm, Michael, everything will be fine if you just put down the gun. - Shut up! Now give me your gun. Hand it over slowly. - Jesus Michael, I think you broke my arm. - Diane, he's the one. He's the one that's been doin' all this. Now get inside and call the police! - Michael, put the gun down. (gun bangs) (groaning) (thuds) (dramatic music) - Diane, look at his hand, it's Danny Evans! - Michael, Michael stop, please, stop it! - Diane! (dramatic music) (grunting) - Stay down! Diane, don't move! We don't want anybody to get hurt. - You never could knock me down, could you, Danny? You never could do anything better than me, and you still can't. Child killer, you fuckin' coward. (dramatic music) (clicking) (thuds) (dramatic music) (groans) (squishy thud) (dramatic music) - It's all right. It's okay. Just give me the gun, Diane. (tense instrumental music) - Diane, no! (tense instrumental music) - Just give it to me. (gun bangs) (groans) (solemn instrumental music) - I never, I never got to tell you, Sean or Dad, I'm sorry. (crying) (groaning) (solemn instrumental music) - Michael, Mike. (somber instrumental music) (gasping) Michael, hang on. Stay with me, hang on. (somber instrumental music) (crying) - Do ya hear that? Listen, listen, Diane. They're callin' your name. (somber instrumental music) (siren wails) (kids softly laughing) (somber instrumental music) (siren wails) (solemn instrumental music)
