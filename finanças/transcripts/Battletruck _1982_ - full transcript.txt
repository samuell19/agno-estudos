Satellite measurements of the Mesopotamian. Basin show that radioactivity levels remain high, and with the oil spills in Arabia still burning, the world's total reserves of petroleum have dropped even lower making gasoline all but unobtainable, except for governmental agencies. Food riots have continued into the third day, and marshal law was declared for all of greater Detroit. Army units and the National Guard have been called in to restore order and the military commander from Michigan. That all looters will be shot on sight. The migration into the countryside continues, and once-peaceful rural areas have become a battlefield as roaming bands of what can only be called bandits raid farming communities for well-hidden supplies of fuel, as well as food and ammunition. The most notorious of these groups is lead by the renegade army colonel Straker who travels in a heavily-armored vehicle and has so far eluded all attempts for capture. With most of the law enforcement agencies fully committed to the cities, it looks like his mobile reign of terror will continue for some time. Hey, you hear that? What's that noise? It's just the wind. - No, I can hear something. Imagination. Holy shit. Come on, move! God damn! Come on, damnit! Move, move! My god, they're moving, for god's sake hurry up! Come on, move! Move it! Discard your weapons and stop immediately. Hey, Boss, they got diesel! Morning. - Morning. Where'd you boys get all that stuff? We're just driving along, we saw these drums on the side of the road, someone must've left them them. I'll take you there no problem. I know where it is, sir. Take you there. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah. Hey, where's he takin' us, this place is radioactive! It's okay, the signs are only there to keep people away. Keep on goin'. Open the gate, Bone. I'm not going in there, it's dangerous! Open the gate. Open the gate. You'll be sorry when your skin turns green and your teeth fall out. - Just drive the truck. There's nothing here, sir. Listen, I'm sick of burning garbage in my truck. It gums up my turbines, I want that diesel, understand? It's in the other quarry round the back. I'm telling you truth, honest! That's good. If you were lying, then I'd have to give you to Willie. He has a few games he likes to play. They work real good on dogs. But dogs don't have nothin' they can fears. I'll show you, it's the truth, I promise, I promise! There's nothing here, I'm gonna kill him! You heard the boss, he's mine! If there's anything left of him, you can have him. Knock it off. Where is it? - Out there! It's underground, I'll show you. It's not booby-trapped, is it? No. No way. - Good, then you show me! They got 50,000 liters, sir. I like this place, we could stay here for a long time. Set up camp. Bone? - Sir. Distribute some home brew to the men, they earned it. Sir. Hey, set up camp! Yes, Willie? - Him, Boss? Bring the girl. How long you boys known about this place? My old man was a quartermaster. When the government collapsed, we sort of inherited it. You were very lucky, weren't you? Yeah. - For a while. What do you mean? - Tie him up. What? Hey, wait a minute! - Gag him. Hey, Boss. Corlie. You're getting old enough to take a little responsibility. Now, this man is a liability to us for various reasons. Do you understand? Good. So I want you to do something. Kill him for me. It's a new world, Corlie. With new rules. Learn them. Bloody drunk, you're weak, come on! Get your hands off me. This place would make a great base camp. Yes, but we're in a valley, so I want complete perimeter protection. Set up a field of fire along this ridge. Automatic weapons here, here, here. Sentries outside the gate, inside the gate. 500 yards up the road, you have lookouts. Patrols leave through this galley, through the high country, returning here every four hours. And most important, I want two men guarding that fuel module around the clock. Yeah, well it all belongs to us now. Of course, Bone, it was inevitable. The generals were just too chickenshit to make a decision. Wars are not won by men of political ambition, my friend. There's too much lipstick and not enough napalm. What was that? - Your imagination. Corlie! Corlie! Jackpot! Hey, Corlie! Corlie! Corlie! Have a cocktail. I hate you, Willie! Why are you running away, Corlie? Don't you like us anymore? Poor little didum, you hurt yourself. Leave me alone, Willie! We've gotta get him, come on! Come on, you guys! Ho, what a prize he'll be! Yee-ha! Hey! Wait! Be back for you, Corlie! Quick, shoot the bastard! Save the bike! Get off. Who were those guys? I don't know, I was lookin' for food and they came up over the ridge. You got people around here? Family? Friends? Anybody? - No, my daddy died. And then my horse ran off with all my stuff. Have you got any food? Get on. Suit yourself. Give me that hose, will ya? What is it? Methane, make it out of chicken shit. Don't you ever get lonely up here? Don't care much for people. Did you fight in the wars? Yep. Bet you nobody ever bothers you up here. Nope. I better have a look at that leg. No, I'll be alright. Maybe. Sit on the bed. Gotta watch every scratch out here. You never know what it might turn into. Most things get better, if you give 'em the time. Not gangrene. That bad? I'll be more careful. What was your father like? He was a saint. Everybody loved him. We'd travel around and help people, fix things. This is gonna hurt some. And then one morning he just didn't wake up. So I kept on goin'. That's what he would've wanted, I guess. We gotta go. - Why? 'Cause that needs sewin' up. Take you down to Clearwater Farm, they got a healer there. Medicine. But I feel much better. - Come on. Wait, let me stay here a while. I can take care of the chickens. I'm a hard worker. Not lately. Yeah, but I can if you give me the chance. You need people, I don't. Okay. Okay, this is it. Just knock on the gate and ask for Rusty. You're not coming in with me? It's not my kind of place. No. Goodbye. Thank you for saving my life. Hunter! Damn. I wanted to show him that new shortwave I've been workin' on. Picked up a signal from Radio Mecca, prayers mostly. Damn! My name's Rusty. I'm Corlie, Hunter told me to ask for you. You're lookin' to join, are ya? Yes. - Good. Good, well, come on in, I'll show you around. Hunter's brought us some of our best people. He sure gets around a lot. Yeah, we're always shorthanded here, even in the winter. But there's plenty to eat if you like turnips. Yeah. - It's a strict democracy. A little old-fashioned, but it seems to work. That's my workshop right over there. Over there, that's the main dome wall, that's where you'll be sleepin' till we can fix you up a place of your own. Well, that is if they vote to let you in. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem, because women are, we have a lot of bachelors, are you single? Yeah, very. Good, good, well don't, just be really nice to everybody, but not too nice to any one person until after the vote, if you get my drift. - Okay. Rusty, where are you taking her? This is Corlie, I'm just showing her... You could be carrying her with a wound like that. Wound? - Come on, honey. Don't you worry, I'll have you fixed up right as rain. There was no doubt that it was a perfect fit, and then, before the two ugly sisters could show their surprise, Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared before them, and with a wave of her magic wand, she changed Cinderella's ragged dress into a gown of golden silk which made the ugly sisters gasp in jealous anger. "Go now," the fairy said to Cinderella. "The coach outside will carry you to your prince." So, Cinderella found true happiness at last with her prince, and the very next day they were married, and lived happily ever afterwards. The end. - Thank you. You're welcome. That's lovely, where did you get it? It was a present. Here. No, I couldn't. - I want you to have it. Okay? Okay, everybody, can we start this meeting? As you all know, Hunter has brought us someone new, and I think you've all had a chance to meet Corlie. Are there any questions? - I've got a question. About Hunter. You said you went to his place. Where is it? - I don't know the area. I was only there for a few minutes. I think we should respect Hunter's privacy. I've been there, Corlie's been there. I just don't see the point. If it came down to him or us, whose side would you be on? That's out of order, Judd, it will never come to that. Now, all those in favor of taking Corlie in. Fine. It's unanimous. Welcome to Clearwater, Corlie. - Thank you. I promise, I'll work very hard. Nice to meet you. Good to have you with us, well done. Thank you very much, thank you. Hi, Corlie. - Hello. How're you feeling? Very well. Say, would you like to take a walk tonight? Maybe. It's just that there's a full moon. We could take a walk up the canyon, and watch it rise through the Devil Peaks. Well, if I'm not too tired. Maybe. Okay, great, I'll see you later. You shouldn't discourage him. It doesn't look like the discourages too easily. How are your hands now? They're still a little sore. Where you came from, didn't you do any work? Not this kind of work. So how did you live? Differently. Charlene, I... Corlie? Corlie, what's wrong? There you go. Everyone back to the village! It's just a stranger, it's probably nothing. But it doesn't hurt to be careful. Do you know what this is? - Leave her alone, Judd. I said, do you know who this is? Look at her, she recognized it right off! Judd, forget it! Come on, Corlie. Come on! Everyone back! Run, Corlie! Come on, we're nearly there. Alvin! Let me go! You don't understand what's coming. Let go of me! - You'll be safe in here. It's not gonna stop! Stop firing. Or I will completely destroy this village. Corlie, stop, they'll just shoot you! Come out. Come outside where I can see you. Everyone throw down your weapons, and put your hands on your head. Move. Move. Good morning, my name is Colonel Straker, and I have come to free you from this anarchy and chaos. Under my leadership, you will relearn the arts of discipline and excellence. Nothing less will be acceptable. So, you can plant your taters and you can grow your sweetcorn, but you will do this at the direction of, and for the purposes of your leader. This ain't no democracy, kiddies. Who's in charge here? Hey, wait a minute, you can't come in... Who's in charge here? We all were. Kind of a democracy. Bone. Sir. Detail the men to inventory and requisition. Yes, sir. Hey, Willie. Inventory and requisition. Loot, loot! I'm taking your weapons, ammunition, medicine. Any furs, precious metals. A sewing machine if you have one and half your food. We're gonna need that for the winter! Don't mumble when the man's talking. I will not abide disrespect. By the way. Where do you keep the women? In the dome behind you. Charlene, it's me, Judd! You better open up, we haven't got much choice! Get in! Please let the children go. Stand up! You. - Sir? Take the children to a different building. Yes, sir. Wait. Just a minute. Where did you get this? - Corlie. I'll keep it safe for now. Willie! - Coming, Boss! Yessum, Boss? - Take the women now. All of 'em? Well now, ladies. Shall we join the, gentlemen? The gentlemen! Have you been harboring a girl named... Corlie, yeah, we tried to kick her out, but everybody here's afraid of the guy that brought her here. Where is she? Well, if she isn't here, she must've run back to him. That guy, Hunter. How do I find this Hunter? He's up in the mountains somewhere. No, Bone, easy. Thanks. I'll tell you who knows. Rusty. He and Hunter are as thick as, they're good buddies. I must have a talk with this Rusty. Bone? Are you alright? What happened? Are you hurt? No, yeah, I mean... They'll kill them, they will! Who? The people you saved me from, they're at Clearwater! Hey, get control of yourself. No, you don't understand! - I think I'm beginning to. No, I'm one of them! Did you warn the people at Clearwater? What good would that've done? Nobody can stand up against 'em. There's always a way to fight back. Anybody follow you here? - No. Okay, come on, you stay here tonight. In the mornin', I'll go out and scout around. See what they're up to. Get some rest, you're exhausted. It's alright. Why do men have to fight? It's always been about who gets more. It has to change. It's been that way for thousands of years. But it must change. Good morning. - Shh! Get dressed. - What's the matter? We've got half a minute to save our ass. You know how to use this? - Yeah. Use it when the time comes, I'll be back. Hunter, this is Straker. Send the girl out and you will not be harmed. Go! Hi, boys. Come on, get dressed! - I'm ready! Get on the bike. - Okay! Come on! Hang on! Don't shoot, you'll hit the girl. Bone! Yes, sir! That sucker isn't gonna live here anymore. Get in. Clear the area. Faster! Throw this. Try again. I got him! Throw it by that tree! He always leaves a garrison behind. Yeah, he's a real pro. What'd you do to this? I looked through them. That'll teach me not to loan out my binoculars. Get off your ass and help these people, come on. Move, move! Where's he sleep? Locked up inside the truck. If he didn't, he'd get a knife through his ribs. Okay, I've seen enough, let's go. Why didn't you tell us the truth? I couldn't. Five good men died because of you. Maybe Straker'll go easy on us if we send her back! That's it, we'll send her back. You're not sending anybody anywhere. We can't sacrifice the whole community for one person. He would have come here anyway, but if you don't want me here, I'll go. Wait a minute, you're not goin' anywhere. You people better make up your minds what you're gonna do. I know what I'm gonna do. I thought they'd killed you. Well, we got a couple of them instead. I told 'em where to find you. I know, you were the only one who knew. They, they took my hand and put... I just wanted the pain to stop. Forget it, Rusty, I know torture. Nobody holds out. You could've. - No. I'd have done the same thing you did. Maybe, maybe not. No blame, understand? No blame. I'm gonna need your help, you're gonna have to make me some kind of light-armored vehicle. Can you still make explosives? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I got some sulfuric left, and I can make a still for the nitric. My hand. Use mine. I've been watchin' real close, I can do all your stuff. You always said I have good hands. Alright. Alright! Follow me. We'll take this manifold into the shop. Corlie, grab a hold of this. Here, take this spring too. Come on, Hunter, grab that spring, let's go! I think I've got some bulletproof glass around here somewhere. Hunter. I've been thinkin'. - Yeah? You're right, we've gotta fight. I'd like to help you, if you'll have me. There's plenty to do. We've been right through that area. Nobody's been in there for years. Motorcycles don't grow wings and fly away. I want you to find him. Hey, Boss! I caught these dirt-eaters tryin' to sneak up on us. What're you boys up to? We live around here, what's it to ya? Well, that's fair enough. Shoot 'em! He's only jokin' ya. Go on home. What a mess. That son of a bitch! Be sure it's not damp. - It's not damp. I hope you're right. Those firing pins are pretty unpredictable. I got it. Did you get the... I didn't knock in case you were asleep. I hope I didn't frighten you. No, it's just that I thought you were Hunter. He should be back any minute. Yeah, he's been workin' like a dog. We all have. Would you like a cup of tea? - No, thanks. I came to apologize. I'm ashamed about the way I acted. Do you forgive me? I suppose so. Hey, maybe I will have that cup of tea. You know, I used to have such a different life. We all did, before it all fell apart. If I'd only met you then, we might've really had somethin'. Yeah, hee-yah, hee-yah! More water, get some more water, somebody! Alvin! - Corlie's in there. Corlie! - No, no, Alvin, no! We've gotta get her out! - Corlie's not in there! She was kidnapped by Judd. Bastard! - Come on, save the barn! Give me that! Where's Corlie? - Don't worry, she's alive. Judd took her in the truck board. How long ago? - Hours. Yee-come on! Yee! We have unfinished to take care of. I guess that's the last we'll of him. Hee-yah! Giddup! Hee-yah! Get out. - Hey, take it easy. I've come to see Straker. - Yeah? I've got a little surprise. Open the gate. Hee-yah, come on! Morning, sir. - News from Clearwater. So what does my little bird have to tell me today? I thought you'd like to know Hunter is dead. Is that right? So? Well, he tried to stop me when I was bringing you a little gift. Sir. Bone, take her to my quarters. Hell, why don't you just let her go? She's more trouble than... Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. You know, you're a very clever fellow, you know that? I'm awfully tired of smelling manure. Well, I can understand that. You know, my mind is wasted on those people. Let's go in here. I'm wanna tell ya, I have some plans. Some great plans. Why have you done this for me? - I knew you'd appreciate it. How'd you get the scratches on your face? She resisted! How dare you touch her. If you ever so much as even think you're gonna look at her, I'm gonna cut you in little pieces and feed you to yourself. Do you hear me? - I promise, I promise. Let go of me! So... You wanna join my little band? Welcome to the club. Right here, it's right here, slow down. Right down there, right down there. I know I hit him, I saw him fall right there. Nothin' there now, mate. Do I kill him, Boss? He rolled all the way down that hill. He was dead, I'm tellin' ya! - Come on, handsome. Hey, Hunter's back! Hunter's come back! Quick, carry him inside. Judd did this? - Yeah. It's lodged. - Yeah, I know. Hang on. It's a septic wound, isn't there any alcohol left? No, they took it all, and the sulfur powder. All we've got left is creek water. You might fight off the infection in a week or two, but... No, I've gotta be on my feet tomorrow. They'll be after me, might come here. I can cure arthritis and boils, but this is a deep septic wound. Cauterize it. Maybe it'll heal all by itself. No, Alvin, he's right. Are you ready? Thanks. I'll never stay with you. You can't own me. Kill me or let me go. Your beauty is from your mother, but your fire and your passion, those are from me. I can't stay with you, you know that. No, I don't. Hunter will kill you. Don't be a child. I wish I could kill you. We love to kill, so we kill what we love. Is that it? No. Or are we mirror images, you and I? My blood. My inheritor. My immortality. I don't know anymore. I believe you lost this, princess. How do you feel this morning? When will it be ready to roll? Well, we need some time for some tests... How soon before the engine runs? A couple hours at least. Just get it running, I'll test it. Hunter. Are you crazy, you've lost a lot of blood, you know? Just get that engine runnin', okay? And the automatic choker's shot, so I put in a manual one. But the methane heats up pretty quick. Now, the tack's not calibrated, so do your RPMs by ear. I know how to drive, just be there when I need you. We'll be here! Don't you worry about us, you just make sure you're there! I hope it holds together. Bye, Hunter! What the hell was that? Hey, you, shoot it! I'm off! Bone, Bo! Shit, what's goin' on? The truck, Willie, get up, come on that truck! Where's Straker? Look out! Bone! Get the gun crewed, wind her up, we're rollin'. Where are we goin'? - I'm gonna kill him! Willie! - Yeah, Boss? Get in the truck, we're goin', Willie. Faster, I want more. She's doing all she can. - I said more! She's not gonna make it, I'm not gonna let you do it to her, you're not gonna wreck my truck. It's not your truck, dumb-ass, you're just the driver. I think he's right, Boss, I think he's right, I'm scared. Not now, Willie. - The truck might blow. Not now! Come on, Bone, come on! - I can't push her anymore! She's coming up to overheat now. I never had a chance to pull that service on her. Shut up and drive. - I know, Boss, I know. If we go back... Shut up, Willie! But if we go back and go round the other... Knock it off, jelly belly, I got a gut full of you! Now, shut up, do you understand? Drive! Rusty! He fell for it, meet you on top! She's overheating, we gotta pull the turbines. Keep rolling. - He'll come back for me. And he'll beat you because he's better. Over my dead body. Now for the rocket launcher. - Your wound's open. Hurry up, it's comin'! I got that, get that other rocket. Shit! Reload. Where is he? Do something! - Shut up. Do something. - Get off, get off! Put that fire out. They've just blown the roof. Keep going. You're running away. - Don't be stupid. We're going to flatten Clearwater. Help me on with this. - You can't, you're too weak. What're you gonna on a bike against that truck? Whatever it takes. He's taking the turnoff. I guess that's the end of Clearwater. Good luck. I'm not gonna let that bastard run my truck. No, it's my truck, Straker! You drive. Drive! Keep it on the road. I saved you, Boss, didn't I? I saved... Your time is over, old man. Not yet, kid. Kill him! Hunter, kill him! "Old man," I'll show you. No! Daddy, would you stop it! Stop it! Let's get outta here. Now! I'll kill you! Goodbye, my friend. Thanks. Look after yourself. I really thought you'd stay. I'll be back. When? Sometime.
