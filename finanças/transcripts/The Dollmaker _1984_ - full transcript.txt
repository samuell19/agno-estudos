It's all right. Come on, don't be afeared. Come on. They're gonna stop. Yeah, but they're staying left. Get outta the way, you damn fool! Hurry up, go on now, get up. What do you think you're doing? You coulda killed us! It's my young'un. I gotta get him to a doctor quick. Well, not in this car. I'm on urgent Army business. 20 mile on, and you're headed thatta way. Please, he's real bad sick. Get off or I'll have you arrested. Hatcher, drive on. - We're stuck, sir. - No, don't, you'll go over the bluff. Here. Hatcher, I gave you an order! Now see here, woman, you... Your tire's caught up! I gotta cut away some of these saplings. I'll get me some rocks for under the tire. Be careful back there, lady. Try her now. I'll push, you give her the gas. Okay. Hope we go. That's better. Now, take your child. Hatcher, drive on. - Amos? - How's the little one? - Amos? - He's turning blue. He's choking to death. Ain't no time for doctors now. Oh, here! Help me! Give me a rock. Flat-like for a pillow. Under 'im. Now hold his head, tight. Hold his hands and feet down. He can't fight it much. He's past feeling anything. Hold him tight now. - What are you doing? You'll kill him! - My god. Now we gotta keep it open. Hold this here. Gonna get something better. How'd you know what to? Oh, it's dipthery, they choke. My Pa saved a cow once that choked, cut a windpipe and put in a piece of tin can. There we go. You're very skillful with a knife. I've always whittled. Ax handles and such-like. But you shouldn't have cut down that poster. That's government property. They need factory workers as badly as soldiers. Ain't a man in our settlement left for him to take, excepting my man, and oh, they've called him now. Well, they can't exempt every little farmer, only those who produce a lot. There's a war on. I know there's a war on. Kilt my brother yesterday. Kilt in action is what the telegram said. I'm sorry. He was a farmer? One of them little 'uns. Hold on, honey. We'll be there soon. What do they grow around here? Young'uns, for the wars and them factories. - Do you farm? - Some. My man hauls coal in his truck. When he can get gas. And we rent a place, give back half what we grow, keep the rest. But I'm saving real hard. We're gonna have a place of our own one day. Here, for the ride. - No, I couldn't think of... - I always aim to pay. Well, a dollar will do, I guess. Here, I'll make you change. Much obliged. Good luck. I ain't never been to a doctor afore. Lady, you can't be afraid of nothing. Just walk in. Okay, just quiet down. I swear. I gotta see a doctor quick! You'll have to wait your turn, ma'am, have a chair there. Oh my Lord, come with me. Did I do wrong? I couldn't just stand by. I believe that you've done all right. Mrs. Nevels, your husband's here. You tired? You'll have to stay up all night and watch that tube. If it clogs, he'll choke. I'll look in again around midnight. Mr. Nevels. Doctor. He's gonna be all right. I knowed he was bad sick or you wouldn't have gone off with your mama needing ya so. Hope you didn't have to watch him get cut. No. I didn't have a heart to tell her. She's so low. Just lays there with that telegram in her hand. We all had to beg her to eat. Cleaned up her plate pretty good, though. She ain't so bad off, then. Oh honey, you know how weakly she is. She's wondering when you come over and do the washing. How's Pa? Poor woman just can't get reconciled to Henley going without salvation. Wants to get the preacher in to pray to give her peace. Says she can't meet Henley in heaven if he ain't been saved. Ma could backslide and go to hell if'n she's so sure Henley would be there. Oh, Gertie, you so tore up, you don't know what you're saying. Henley ain't damned just 'cause he went square dancing with me and Pa 15 year ago. Besides, you was there too. Well. Why don't I get you some good hot coffee and a hamburger? You ain't never had a hamburger in your life. Don't go wasting good money. I'll be on Uncle Sam's payroll in a few weeks. You'll be getting money regular then, every month. More than I ever earned around here. I don't know why they're calling a man your age. What's this settlement gonna do without your tinkering? I wish to goodness you wouldn't call it tinkering. People that can fix machines as good as me makes real money in them war jobs. More than any farmer. We was livin' in Will'er Run or Detroit, there'd have been an ambulance to take him to hospital too. You reckon the doctor'd miss a board or two from this? I could make Cassie a jumping jack doll. Pass the time. Jumping jacks. Why don't you make something a body can use? Oh, this wood's only fitting for dolls. I better get back to the kids. You need cash? I got some. 40 dollars? There. Amos, look. Ain't nobody seen it but you. That's the money for our farm. You ain't gonna work your life away plowing another man's land. That's molasses money and... The eggs I sold to Samuels. Them two sholts I butchered last fall. 310 dollars. And now... 350. Soon as your poor pa gets in the Army, we're gonna buy us a place of our own! Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land in which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Thou shout not kill. But they killed uncle Henley. Yes, they did, honey, but that don't change the rules. Now stop that, you bad young'un! Don't do that, Cassie Marie, you'll be ruining it. It wasn't me, Ma, it was Callie Lou. Make her behave, Ma. She won't never pay no mind when she's got that Callie Lou in her head. Cassie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt ya. You'uns have lessons to finish. Reuben, you got copying to do? Yes, ma'am. Cassie Marie, come here, honey, bring your primmer. Oh, my girl. Oh, you remember where we were? No. There it is. Oh, honey, don't get so far away, you can't see. "Here, Bobby, you can play. You can play with my kitten. Look, Bobby..." Here, now, that'll do, now. What's this word? Ball? No, honey. No, that's play. This 'un? Come? Awe, Cassie Marie, you got the whole primer by heart. - That's can. - That's easy. - I'm never gonna learn. - Hush. Don't fret, you're young yet. Gertie? We gotta finish loading the truck. They ain't finished their lessons yet. Well, John'll be waiting. Come on, Jep. Sorghum was real good this year, Pa, that's the biggest crop we ever had. Yeah, you done that son. And Ma. I never wanted your mama out breaking her back in some field. But she likes it, Pa! All her life, she's had her hands in the dirt and always half the crop to old man Ballew. You know what I'd make in one of them big city war plants? Your momma could just watch your house. But she likes her hands in the dirt, Pa! About ready? Ma, could I go huntin'? I done all my chores. I thought you was going with your mama to help your grandpa Kendrick. Aw, let him go, he's worked hard all fall at Ma's and here. And Henley would've maybe gone hunting today. Be careful, son. Well, let's go! Come on, Jep. Come here, Jep! Bye, honey! Bye, Ma! Come on, Jep. Now don't you go shooting me and Cassie, son. - Recollect we're going down past the old Tipton place? - Okay. Look, Ma! Callie Lou brought me new red shoes! 40 dollars in the Ward's catalog! Where'd she get all that money? Callie Lou's man, he's gone away to the wars and he makes good monies. I can see two little girls in your eyes, Ma. That's you, honey. Me and Callie Lou. Ma, make me a hickory sprout doll? Well, here's a good 'un. Look at the old Tipton place, Cassie. Ain't nobody been living here for quite a spell. It's for sale. Make her a curlidy skirt, Ma. You think this ol' house is purdy? Sure do. Purdy's the least of it though. It's gonna be warm in the winter and cool in the summer too. No matter how hard the wind blows, that house ain't never gonna shake. Ma, I seen a bear! A bear, are you sure? Biggest old thing you ever did see! I shot at him, but he was too far off. I ain't see'd a bear in these parts since I can remember. I bet he was fishing. We lived here, we'd get us a lot of fish outta that river. Here you go, honey. You know, once'd on a time, your great-great grandpa Kendrick owned all this land. My grandpa sold it to the Tipton's and now old John Ballew owns it. I used to come here when I was about your size, honey. Reuben, back in the hillside over there, there's this real deep cellar. Nothing never froze in that cellar nor spoilt in the summer neither. And we put them apples and pears in the cellar wouldn't we, Ma? We picked blackberries, our own blackberries in our own fields. There's a heap of good manure around back. You've been studying it? Just passing by. There's a good garden place too. Even if old John wanted to sell and even if you had the money, Pa'll never let ya. He'll be wanting a new truck or something like always. Like he sold a cow last spring to get them new tires. But he ain't gonna need nothing in the Army. He's gonna want us to have a place of our own. He's always hated having to give away half of what we raised. Son, I'm fixing to talk to old John. Does Pa know? Well, we're gonna surprise him. Come on, Cassie, let's go see Grandma. Maybe if it... if it hadn't been for you, Henley would've given himself to God. You was the oldest, but, but he seen ya. He seen ya's standing there stiff necked and stubborn in the face of Almighty God and you never did repent your sin of dancing. Oh, what are we gonna do without Henley? You Pa is so mule minded. Just have to sell this old place and move in with Mag. But... Pa could never live in town. Oh, well Gert, this war was all foretold. You ought to read your Bible more. "I come not with peace, but with a sword," Christ said. Oh, he's scourageing the world like he scourged the temple. - And in his mighty... - Mom? Mom, maybe there's another side to Christ. Recollect he went to the wedding feast and he had time to fool with lil' young'uns. He was like Henley, he worked and he loved his fellow men and... Oh, Cassie Marie, get my smelling... Oh, Mama. And I'm mighty bad constipated, you know, mighty bad. You just rest a while, Ma. I'll make you a cup of tea. Pa? Oh, Pa! Cassie. How's Amos? I've been aiming to ride up and see him, but your mama been so bad I couldn't leave. He's fine. How's your leg, Pa? Ah, it's nothin' to speak of, but I sure was lucky having Reuben to help me with the foal work. And then the Kramer boys will help me a few days. - I hear they went away. - Headed for Detroit. Yeah. Get themselves killed in one of them factories up there if they ain't careful. I declare there won't be enough men left around here to dig the graves. Seems like they could have left us Clovis to keep the mail truck running. I hoped they would. Maybe I oughta let him go to a factory. He wanted to. It was mostly me afeared he'd want me 'n' the young'uns to follow him to some city. Clovis is gonna be all right in the Army. How's your rheumatism, Pa? It's so cold for you out here. Well, you know how it is, the mess I make with all that whittlin' aggravates your mama so much. And it seems right now I gotta be whittlin'. What's this, Grandpa? Oh, Pa! It's real pretty. I ain't made a fiddle in 15 years. Remind me of Henley, I guess, and out here, it don't do no harm. I wished I was closeder. Maybe when Clovis' Army money is coming in regular, maybe I can move. The old Tipton place? Gertie! Gertie! Gertie, Gertie, oh. Oh, the Reverend Graham is coming down the road. This the last chance I'm gonna have to see about yourself. Now here, here, Gert. Oh, you've been a good girl. In some ways. Here, take these, those are for you. Father and I have talked it over and you helped us a sight back in your younger days. And, uh, and your pa and me, we can... we can get along somehow. You and Pa needs it worse than me and Clovis. It was Henley's cattle money. He wanted you to have it. All of it. Well, oh, it was his dying wish. He writ me from the Army, if anything happened to him, we should help Gertie. You raised it, he said. Ma! - Ma! - Gertie! Gertie, think of me! Mama! Ma! Don't cry, Ma, don't cry! Oh, honey, I'm all right. Less'n you choke me to death with hugging. "Miss Cassie hugged her Ma to death." That'd be a pretty piece for the paper, wouldn't it? Oh, Henley! Was you crying 'cause Grandma says Uncle Henley can't never go to Jesus? Oh, stuff, body don't have to go to him. He's right here all the time. Have you seen him? Well, kind of like you seein' Callie Lou. Did he look like a preacher dressed in suit clothes? No, seemed he wore overalls and he made things like your grandpa. I ain't never see'd his face. It seems to me he'd be always laughing. Laughing like I want the Christ in the Cherry wood block I'm working on. When you gonna let him out, Ma? He's a-comin', Cassie. He's gonna bust out in a jostle one of these days. Your pa is here. Time to get up. It's your Army examining day, honey. There's coffee on the stove and water warmin'. You best hurry. Oh Lord, my old woman trying to be shed of me. Oh Lord, look at that, now get on! Lots of times I think you don't love me a bit. Oh man, you're a fine one to talk of love. I could be tied hand and put in a burning house and if they told you the old grist mill was broke down, you'd run off first to see what ailed the mill. Oh Gertie, you as jealous of machinery like it was another woman. I can't much blame you though. For all my machine fixing and coal hauling. It's been a poor due. We ain't so bad off. There's a heap of folks seen it worst. Don't go wake the young'uns! But I wanna tell 'em goodbye. Well, you'll be back tonight after the test. Oh, I cleaned your boots. I look like I've been shaved with a cross cut saw. Wish we had electricity and running water like Mag. Electric lights don't fill empty bellies. Your sister's got it easier than you, living in town. Her kids has got good schools. Our kids are learning. Always wanted you to have it better than Mag, way better. You wasn't raised to eat sow belly in some sharecropper shack. You eating? I ain't hungry. You coming down with something? Girl, a man don't go off to the Army every day. I wish you'd've woke the kids up. But it ain't like you was goin' for true. Honey, would you put some water in the radiator for me? But don't go trying to crank her now, I'm always telling you that that ain't woman's work. I could drive a tractor since'd I was as big as Cassie. Can't you look what you're doing Cassie? You're so messy, you're half pig! If I went around pouring out stuff that'a way you'd slap me! You're bigger than her. Quit measuring your corn in somebody else's basket. You too, Clytie. I didn't mean to spill it. You're always spilling something. - Leave her be! - You're the young'un! I ain't! Piggy, pig, pig. I ain't! Enoch, one more word and I'll get your pa's razor strap. You can't do that, Ma, it ain't there no more. Callie Lou was so mean this morning I said, "I'll show you what you'll get if you go on this way." And I took her to see the strap and it weren't there no more. Pa's took it clean away. Ain't Pa coming back tonight? You let him go without waking us? Has Pa gone to the war? He's gone and we ain't never gonna see him no more. He'd go to one of them factories where they make bombs and stuff. Well, I guess he'll write us a letter, telling us where he's gone. Mama Nevels! Cassie. - Howdy, Kate. - Hello, Gert. We'll have news of Clovis today. Don't you fret. Mrs. Hull. Three dozen, they're laying right well. Gert! Where's Clovis? Ain't the mail in yet? Clovis ain't driving no more, Mamie. He's gone. Gone? What'll I do when the coal runs out? I can't cut wood to do no one no good. I'll send Reuben to cut you some wood. Mamie's eggs. You seen old John? Not yet. My Pa's gone to the wars. My Pa flies airplanes. You know, I'm afeared that her man ain't coming home, he's been missing in action so long. How? Mrs. Hull, I just can't stand waiting. You got something for me to do? Hey, get over here! Mrs. Hull, you seen Gertie Nevels? She's in the garden over yonder. Gertie, you about the best hand with a hoe I ever seen. Well, I've had plenty of practice, Uncle John. There's a little piece of business that you and me ought to get into. You want me to move and ashamed to say so? You're one of the best renters I ever had. But if you and me could do a little trading, your renting days would be over. Don't seem like the time to talk o' trading. Didn't you know they've took Clovis? Them Army wages comes in mighty steady. I can rent pert near any place I choose. Is that why I see you looking at the Tipton place, knowing it's for sale? Well I don't know, Uncle John. I ain't hardly give'd it a thought. But how much you gimme to take it off your hands? Now Gertie, I have know'd your old Pa for 50 years. Now Henley was his only'st boy and you're old Pa would give his good leg to know that you was always gonna be close by. And that place is yours, girl, for what I give for it, five hundred. Put whatever you want down and the rest later. I could pay for it, Uncle John, pert near all of it. Missus! There's a car! Was a car brought the news about Henley, a Red Cross lady in a blue coat. It's the same one! Evening, ma'am, you've brung us word? I have a message for Mamie Childers. Miss Childers, your husband is safe. He's a prisoner of war in Italy. And I brought you your mail. Now, if you'll all pay attention, I'll call out the name. Thank you, ma'am, I'm the post mistress, I give out the mail here. Mrs. Robert Maples, McKinley Opal. Come over to the porch. Mrs. Harold Agee? Mrs. Gertrude Nevels? Here, it's postmarked Detroit. Ms. May Boyd. Is it from Pa, Ma? Is he all right? They didn't get him in the Army. "Dear Gertie, well, I passed the Army, but they said I would not be called for a right good spell. So I went to a factory, like I should have done a long time back. I got me a job that suits me. It pays good. I sold the truck and it brang more than I paid. It was them good new tires. Now I am getting a place so you and the children can come here to Detroit. I am sending some money. I will send more when I have a payday. You and the children needs clothes. I want you not to have it so hard. Write to me, Clovis." They's lots of kisses too, Ma, see that big line of crosses? Don't go, Gert, he'll like it there. If'n you follow him, he might never come back. Now, you know I'd never go up there. I'm gonna save just about everything he sends so's he can buy him another truck when he comes back home. There's all them little flowers all wrapped up for spring. Why you bringing pine trees too, Ma? We'll plant 'em either side of the gate at our new house. They got the prettiest voices of all the trees, Cassie. You better plant 'em real deep or that bad Callie Lou will come pull em up again. You see her trying to pull 'em up, you tell me, I'm gonna give that young'un a good twitching! You won't make it too hard, will you, Ma? She ain't a bad young'un at heart. Just full of jumping meanness. Well, I'll just scare her. No hickory limb, I'll just cut me a twig from that little peach tree outside our new kitchen. Ma! What's the matter, Ma? Gertrude, Gertrude! Grandma, is Grandpa dead? No! No, your grandpa ain't dead, but he'd be better dead. That poor, old, crippled soul with its own flesh and blood bringing disgrace down on his own gray head! What's Mag gone and done? Oh, Mag! Mag ain't done nothing. Mag is a decent woman. She is not sneaking and conniving to leave her man and make her children fatherless! It's St. Paul said, he said wives be in subjugation to their husbands and you know what your mammy done? When your poor daddy is all alone, in a strange place and he is working so hard to put bread in your mouth... She bought us a place of our own. Oh Lord, oh Lord. She turned her own children against their father. Ma, I'm home! Look at your daughter, growing up like a heathen. She wouldn't be going to ruin if Clovis was around. She's just been over at Mamie Childers helping with the young'uns. And that trashy Mamie teaching her how to dance. What are you fixing to order from this catalog, girl? Curtains, white curtains with blue bands for our new front winders! Child, you don't want curtains. You don't need curtains till you go to Detroit! Detroit? Yes Detroit, Detroit. Your daddy wants y'all with him and your mama's gonna do her duty and take you there. Detroit. Detroit. Oh, this poor little fella. He needs somebody to look after him, running around barefooted, he's gonna get that ole croup again. Ma, can Jep go to Detroit too? And can we take Miss Callie Lou? We ain't going yet, honey. Clytie, make your grandma a cup of coffee. Mama, don't let her! Your ma sent for me. The way she talks about it you'd think I was making a mint selling you this place. Twice'd I thought she was going to faint, dead away. We both got to do our duty, Gert. I can't let a piece of land come between a woman and a man and her people. But Ma bought it! She gave you the money! You're gonna have to give me back the key. The right's on her side, Gert. If Clovis is making a living, you've got to go to him if he wants it thatta way. But you asked. You said, did I wanna buy it? You said I should be close to my Pa. Yeah, but we thought Clovis was gonna be in the Army then. But he ain't. And it's what he wants that matters, you're his wedded wife. I'm sorry, girl. Enoch? Reuben? Look where you going, lady! Dumb hillbillies. Three Planks Express leaving on Northbound track 11 for Toledo. Ma! Over here! Buffalo, New York all aboard please. All aboard! Sit down, Ma. You look peaked. It's snowing out there, Ma, like you've never seen! And it don't fall down, it goes crosswise! There's a place you get drinks. You want some good hot coffee, Ma? Can I have a Coke? We gotta wait for your Pa. Pa didn't sound prime sure he'd meet us. He said to take a cab. Give me the tickets for the baggage, Ma. Reuben and me'll go get 'em, I seen where. Let me go, Ma, I'm the oldest. You can't manage that cherry woodblock, none of ya. Grandpa sent it separate, that and the big trunk. Railway Express, he said. Railway Express is different, it comes later. I hope they treat it good. We shoulda wrapped it. The tickets, Ma! You oughta used your new purse, Ma. You look like a body outta the funny papers, Ma! Your hat's all...crooked. Get it. Who'd've thought it'd be so cold in the fall this way? I got one over here! Here, for the young'un! God bless ya. Where to, lady? 18911 Mary Hill. It's close to where my Pa works at the Flint plant. Which one? Old Man Flint owns half of Detroit. My Pa's helping make stuff for the war. He's fighting it. How fast can you go? I gotta drink this coffee. Don't smell like coffee. The smell froze. Now, where the Dickens is Mary Hill? Well, I reckon it's a great big place. Three or four stories high and we'll ride the elevator. Detroit's not like Kentucky? How'd you know where we was from? I've met yous at the station through two World Wars. And you're going back pretty soon? Money saved to by a farm, right? One of them big bluegrass farms. - My ears are freezing. - All right. This is it? This is it, lady. Come on, Cassie Marie. It's freezing, Ma, light the stove! I don't know how. It's easy, look! On! Right down in there. There's coal here, but no kindlin'. Ma, Miss Callie Lou don't like it here! Ma, I'm cold. Well, jump around a bit now, it'll warm us up. Quit the racket kids! I gotta sleep! Why's he sleeping in the daytime? Maybe he's sick. Can it will you? I'll call the cops! I gotta sleep! They's afeared! And they's cold! So build them a fire! Ain't no kindlin'. There's kindling in my shed, out front on the porch. Much obliged! You took that out of Victor's shed! He'll get ya! He knows. I gotta get my young'uns warm. Ma keeps the oven on when hers got no coal. You're a hillbilly ain't ya? I lit it, Ma! And we found some stuff Pa left! Tastes funny! It's pasteurized, silly! That's what school book says. There's a cow behind it somewheres. - Drink it. - Hey, y'all. These beans ain't much. I didn't have no pork and Clovis don't have ration points yet. I had to use a bit of bacon grease. I'm plum ashamed of myself. Told Clovis I'd start y'all a fire when I got up this morning to get the boys off to school, then I fell right back asleep again till Wheateye comes yelling you'd come. You said you'd knock my head off if I woke you up again. Sure is good of you to go to all this trouble. Well, it's like I said to Wheat last night, a body's got to have something to make 'em think of home when they find theirselves in this dump. You live with the man that yells? Oh no, that's Victor! He's on nights at the steel plant. Don't you pay him no mind, he's all bark. Now we live on that side. My man works with your daddy. I'm Sophronie Meanwell. Y'all dig in now 'fore this all gets cold. That Miss Meanwell talk's kinda like us, Ma. Wasn't she dressed pretty? That slip. Body could see right through it. Maybe Ma was right, I did ought to be here with your pa. Why? It's awful stuffy in here, ain't it? They's double windows. The outside ones won't open, I tried. The seat fell back on him. Here, honey, let me look. Fix his pants, Enoch. It's 46 cents. I didn't ask for no ice. You gotta have ice, lady. Pay 'im, Ma! It's so hot in here everything'll spoil! Ice! Coal! Over here! Number 17! Anything else you want, lady? Aww honey, you ain't hurt, just scared. [staticky radio playing Y'all, it's a real live man, Ma! Look Ma, we got a radio! Make that thing turn off! - Cut the racket! - I know how! I'll call the cops! Make it quit! Anybody home? Pa! How's my girl? Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Hi, Gert! Supper ready? You done real well, Clovis! Buy so much stuff and send us the truck money besides. Lord, woman! Surely you don't think I paid for all this? Up here, everybody buys on time. How much we owe? Now, come on, Gert. I'm making big money. I done what I aimed to do. Got on as a machine repair man. And I'm good at it. You know what my paycheck will be this week? Better than a hundred dollars. Pa! We're rich! A hundred dollars? Well, I don't reckon I'll make that every week. Of course that's 'fore union dues and taxes and all. It ain't no fortune. Took real savings to get the down payment on all this, and the car. Clovis, you got all these debts afore we even come. How you gonna manage with me and the young'uns here? Don't worry, old woman, they like me. I get in a heap overtime too. Besides that, I'm in real good with all the union men. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm glad you come, Gertie. I've sure been missing ya. Shoot. It's all right, honey. Go to sleep now. Clovis, ain't hardly room to breathe in this place. Sophronie, come on here to bed now, I gotta get up and go to work here in a minute. I ain't ready to go bed, I ain't finished my drink yet. Now come on, baby! Ma, the Daly kids is leavin'! We'll be late! But Sophronie said 8:30, it's only just past eight! Hey guys, wait up! We got to parochial school. Go to your public school, hillbilly! With the niggers and the Jews. Ma, I don't think people up here carries baskets! I do! - Oh, hi! - Y'all come home right after school. Come on, kids, ain't ya coming to school? Now Gert, you don't wanna drag him all that way! Amos, honey, you come inside and play with Wheateye. Ain't Wheateye going to school? No, she goes second shift. They got more kids than space. Hey, Amos, you want a cookie? Oh, Ma, I wanna go home! Please, let's get home, I can't learn to read no how and I'm freezing cold! Oh honey, school's gonna be the prettiest place. You'll see. There'll be a big yard to play games and a big fun lunch room. Room with nothing but books. Here kid, it's gum, you chew it! Don't be scared, kindergarten's nice. But you oughtn't tell such big lies, lady. I had a time with Joey, here, on account I lied to him. He's your little brother? Yeah, Pop's a gun on the Pacific and Mom works a seven to three shift at Flints. Her runs one of them big presses, good as a man! Got her 14 hours overtime last week! Come on, kindergarten's this way. Garcia. Is that how you say it, Garcia? He don't know English, Miss. I seen him on my street. He won't play or nothing. He's a dummy. Now stop that, Rachel, Garcia is gonna be our friend. It just takes a little while when you don't understand the word. Well, hello! Have you come to join us? This is Cassie. Cassiah Marie. Hello, Cassie! I'm gonna tell you a story in a minute. You came just in time! And on your first day we let you chew your own gum! You find it's much easier if you take your mittens off first. Chicle? Well, look at that. He said something to us. Give him a piece, Cassie. Can you say thank you, Garcia? Thank you. She'll be all right. Bye, Cassie Marie. Would you file these, please? Mrs. Ogorski, talk slower. Olga, you understand Hungarian? It's gotta be Hungarian 'cause it's not Ukrainian, it's not Polish. Take this, will ya? May I help you? - I gotta sign up my young'uns. - Name? Nevels. Is that basket from Poland? Kentucky's my country. It's beautiful. Are those wood strips? White oak splints. It's a beautiful color. You've stained it. Oak weathers thatta way. I always liked the color of clean weathered oak wood. It's as pretty as tobacco when it's hung up to cure. You carve, huh? You mean whittle? Backs, handles and such. Foolishness like dolls for young'uns. Fill these out, Miss Nevels. - Thank you. - When will they get home? Oh, about noon for lunch. You mean they ain't no school lunch? Ain't no place to eat! The little 'uns only come for half day no how. This school ain't got nothing but teachers and kids. Too few of one and too many of the other. My name is Mr. Skyros. I'm the arts and crafts teacher. May I borrow your basket for a few days? I'd love to show it to the children. I've left four young'uns here. I guess I can leave an ol' split basket. Oh, don't worry about the children. They'll be fine, they're young. They'll adjust. They'll what? Well, they'll learn to get along. Be like the others. I want 'em to be happy. I don't knows I want 'em to... At least ways, not too much. You have good hands. Good for working. They're strong, an artist hands. I'd like to see one of your dolls someday. Thanks for the basket. Can...can I help? Nobody can help. Maybe you get to go home soon. War won't last forever. This one will. Lord, bless thee and keep thee. Lord, make his face shine upon thee and give thee peace. You're Catholic? No, I ain't. Try to sleep. I need a dream. What do you dream about? Spring. Spring, I like that. Thanks. Oh, Callie Lou, look what my boot has went and done. Did you ever see such boots, Callie Lou? Eating up shoes this'a way? Quit the silly talking to yourself, Cassie Marie. Kids will laugh at you. Get your mittens. You make me late just waiting for you. I ain't talking to myself and I don't need you to take me to school never no more. Now young'uns, don't fight. Cassie needs milk money today, Ma. It's the Christmas basket drive this week. Me and Reuben should take some too. We need money for too, Ma. A dime at least, each! You think we're made of money? Oh, come on, Gert. If every nickel you spend's like losing or drop of blood, you'd be bled dry in no time. Cassie Marie! Here, honey. Take this to the Christmas basket drive. Oh Ma, they don't want that! Clovis? Mornin', Gert. Whit. How's Sophronie? Oh, she banged herself up at the plant yesterday. She's okay though. Your man'll be a little late tonight, Gert. Yeah, we got a union meeting. Bender's gonna be there. - Who's Bender? - He's Mr. Union. That was a good dream you give me last night. I'm Max, Victor's wife. You're Gertie Nevels, ain't ya? Is this your youngest? - Amos. - He's cute! Hi, Amos! You going shopping? You wanna hold my hand too? - Hey, kid! - Hey! Hey, what'd you do to your head? Fell off that damn merry-go-round. What's a merry-go-round? It's a thing that goes around and around, what else? Hey Joe, want green beans, two pounds, and a cauliflower and two acorn squash. It's in the factory. It's like assembly only it goes around, and you walk with it. I got dizzy. Only in Flint and his factories. One of these days, he's gonna figure out a way so's a man can drop in a coffin on one end of an assembly line and step right out in hell and shoveling coal at the other. You can keep that job of yours. Only danger in waitressing is a blue butt from all the pinching. Hey, what'd you dream about last night? Clark Gable. He ain't in my book. Max here plays the numbers. Gets 'em outta some crazy dream book. She's gonna make her fortune. - Ain't you gonna ask Gert for one? - I already did. She's gonna be lucky for me. Uh, Miss? Two cabbages and taters. How many pound do you want, eh? How many in a pound? 10 pounds. I never bought 'em before. We growed everything. It's a four dollar and 93 cents. You put 'em up on me again, Joe, you're a regular Flint. Hey listen, you don't want it, you no buy. Oh, I'll take 'em. What's a nickel? What's a dollar? What's a million dollars? Old Man Flint makes that every day, don't he, Joe? With his tanks and bombs. Like my Pa used to say, blood's the cheapest thing on earth, but there's money in it. Hey, what number you wanted today? I want a winner, Joe, but you never gimme one. What is it? Cigarettes, black market. How can she spend all that? That dumb Polack she's married to must weigh 250 at least. You feed 'im or you lose 'im! Hey, Max! Want a hand? Oh, Gertie! I got some stuff that come for ya from Railway Express. You come in and get it whenever you can. - You want some coffee? - No, thanks. Come on, Amos, let's play! Seems like all he has to do is raise his head and there he'd be. Ain't it something? Gives me the willies. D'you make that? It's Christ ain't it? I always kindly hoped so. I can't seem to find a face. I want him laughin'. Not like these Victor's got hanging all over. Not a smile in the whole bunch! You got a good, steady man. Ma, look at the pretty necklace. That's one of Victor's rosaries. Whoo for heaven sakes, Wheateye! Amos? He's got dozens of 'em. Your husband? 'Pends on who you're listening to. - Not if you talk to his mother. - Why? 'Cause we wasn't married Catholic. We was in a hurry, see? I was pregnant. My baby lived three days. Victor's Ma said it was a judgment. I hate her. I ain't going nowhere near her damn church! Wouldn't do no harm. Well, we was married legal! And Victor knows that! He could shut her up, but he just lets that old witch jabber on about me in Polish! Mama's boy! He ain't no man. Ya early. 10 hours, enough. That's purdy! Victor, you oughtly give Gertie here a hand with that stuff that come for her. All the time, she want genuine, hand carved crucifix. Who? My mom. You make one? Well, I don't know nothing about such like. I pay good, 15, maybe 20 dollar? Make it, um, this big. Well, if it ain't no good, you don't have to take it. It'll be good. Down payment. Ya, ya, my brother licked your brother! You just wait, hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly! Your ma ain't got no shoes! Hillbillies come to Detroit and Detroit went to hell! Run home to your old man, why don't ya? Get your drunk old man! My brother's lick the Daly. Looks like our kids cleaned up on the Daly's for once. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Let go! Let go! Let go, ya hillbilly fool! Your beatin' up on a little kid half your size! Pa, he hurt me! Don't you go mixing in it now, he'll call the cops! Youses in Detroit now kid you've gotta mind the law! We got rules for garbage like you! You're all alike! You come up here and for the first time in your life, you get food in your bellies and shoes on your feet, and it goes to your head! Well, don't tell me you got shoes! How does it feel to have shoes on them tough feet? No! Reuben, no! I didn't hit your young'un! They ganged up on my brother and they had a lump of coal! - You're lying! - No, he ain't! I see'd it! You call me a liar, you hillbilly slime, and I'll have you run in! The cops listen to Joseph Daly, see? I'm a decent, respectable, religious American. I seen your young'un with a lump of coal. Young'un? Where's you get young'un? In Detroit, you gotta learn to speak English, you communist hillbilly! Who threw that? I did, Mr. Daly! Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit ya. Cops! Here come the cops! See? Now you'll get a ride! Cops don't get ya for little old fusses. If'n it's me they're huntin', tell 'em I'm right here! They're not for you, lady. Whadda they want? 18904 Mary Hill. That's my house! Oh, I hope it ain't bad news about his Pa. He's off fighting in the Pacific. I know her, she's on the shift after mine, runs a press. I didn't do nothing. You grabbed me like a little kid in front of everybody. Honey, he'd been drinking! And this is Detroit! You're gonna have to quit carrying your knife. I ain't quitting nothing. I ain't a-making myself over for Detroit. Standing, taking people's lies like you done. Ma, my bubble gum boy's ma got killed. Oh honey, here. Pa's home! Pa's home! - You sick? - Do I look sick? We had a walk out. What's that, a walk out? Oh, for God's sakes, Gertie! Everybody walks off the job. It was a protest. Some woman got caught in her press. It was Billy Hansen's mother. She got killed! We had a big snow fight, Pa! And Mr. Daly yelled at Reuben! Reuben better learn to watch his manners. Ma, you know that chickadee you give Cassie for the basket sale? Mr. Skyros paid three dollars for it! Three dollars? And he says, will you make him a jumping jack like mine? Use the money. Your pa is hungry. I'll feed you 'uns in a little while. Oh Lord, it burnt. What's this? Fish. Only thing wasn't sky high at the market. Clovis, when them others walked off, couldn't you have stayed? If you want me to come home with a busted nose. When the union says walk, you've gotta walk. This ain't fit for a dog! What's got into yo' cooking? You got plenty to spend. You got all them ration books. I spent better than 25 dollars this week for grub, not counting the milk. 25 dollars! You can't feed seven good eaters on that! What's the use of living like this if'n a body can't save something? - When we go back home I'm... - Save! That's all I've heard since we've been married. Millions of people don't never save nothing. They buy on time. Ain't always starving their young'uns either. I ain't a-starving nobody. You've been buying the cheapest grub you can get. Look at this place! Can't you cover up the floor or something? I bought us curtains. Gertie, how much have you saved outta the money I've been giving you? About...about 50 dollars. You've been feeding us junk like that. Letting the place go like a pig pen. All my life I wanted you and the kids to have nice things. I bet I'm making twice'd what any of 'em farmers back home's doing. For God's sake, spend it! Look at that cookware! That's the same old pot my momma give us when we first got married to make do till we got our own! Let me keep it a bit. When they've had a drop too much, it's not good to take the thing back in. Not too soon and don't cry. It makes them worse, I know. He ain't drinkin', he just wants some new pans. It's a 1939 IcyHeart, Ma, nine and a half cubic feet! He give it to me real cheap and on time too. It's real sweet of you Clovis. It's just, I lived a long time without such. Miss Nevels! Miss Nevels, come look at me! Hi, Wheateye. Look at my new dress, Miss Nevels. You look purdy, Wheateye. Miss Nevels, can Reuben come skate with me? Reuben didn't get his skates, we got a wagon! Come on! Take Miss Callie Lou sailing in your new boat that Ma made you. Ma, you gotta make her quit that Callie Lou stuff. Some of the kids are saying she's cuckoo. Put your coat on if you're going out! Mack come for ya, you wanna go out? You could show 'em your building set. Kid stuff. Why do we have to stay here? 'Cause your pa is working for the war, honey. Reuben, I ain't made myself over for Detroit. I'm still saving... I'm saving everything I can for our own place. Maybe 'fore next Christmas you'll be sowin' your grass seed. Oh, honey. Hey, Gertie! Come here! Pa, look what that mean Cassie done. She took the skirt off this fine new doll you give 'er and put it on this old thing! Cassie Marie, you come back here! Well, she's working. You got your electric icebox, old woman. I always wanted Clytie to have a nice store bought doll. She's too old now. All the money I spent. Little Cassie and Reuben, what did they want? Maybe they don't want things, Clovis. Wheateye! Oh, Wheateye! Wheateye! Oh, come back, honey, I ain't finished fixing your hair! Wheateye! Oh, Miss Bommarita! Miss Bommarita, you got my Wheateye in there? Did you see her pretty hair? - She ain't here! - Oh. - Mom! - Mom, please come home. Damn! Please let my mom in, she don't know what she doin'! - Wheateye! - If you hillbillies don't get outta here I'll call the cops! I don't wanna see no damn wop's house no how! I don't need a coat this time a day. Oh, Merry Christmas, Gert! - Oh, Miss Nevels! - Wheateye! Take her into our house, my mom's home. Oh, is your mom home? Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, Mrs. Daly! - Let 'er in! - Mary and Joseph! Come on, Frankie, let's dance! Mom, Miss Meanwell's in here with no clothes on! Oh, this damn merry-go-round. It's 'round and 'round, can't stop or you'll fall. You can punch your eyes out falling, but I didn't. You gotta keep going. No matter what. Careful of the stove! Why don't you lay down and rest a spell? Oh, I can't my relief ain't come. What's happening, can I help? Oh, my Lord! Your reliefs here, huh? See! Why don'tcha lay down so she can get back to work. Yeah, better lay down. But I didn't fall, did I? I didn't fall! Clytie, you're gonna freeze yourself to death. You shoulda wore your snow pants. Aw, Ma, the only place you need snow pants is in the movies. So the fellers can't get their hands up your skirt. Honey! Look, Ma! There's a parade. That's where Pa works. What are we gonna do about it? We can stay every day of the week if we stick together! One of these very men was killed and Old Man Flint hasn't done anything to correct the safety problems, he's forced us out! Not now, no! Clovis, go, he'll be okay! What are you doing here? - It's Open House, Pa. - Get in here. Bender's all right, they got him away. This here is Tom Cooper, friend of mine. We better get to headquarters. Pa, why are those men hitting each other? Drive by the school, will ya? Erie Street? Them's bullies, Cassie Marie. Union man's just fighting back. Can't bust a union by the busting heads. What's a union? Kinda like a family, honey. You know, working together. Now do you see why I kept your basket so long? It's just wetland foolishness. Do you have any others like these? Just toys for the young'uns, birds and critters. I reckon Amos has 'em all now. It's enchanting, it's more than a toy. A friend of mine was admiring it, he's an interior decorator, really very well known. And he said that he has never seen carving like this. The children tell me that you're working on something larger, a block of cherry wood? How big a piece is it? Stands about yay high. It ain't near finished. Might I look at it one day? Why yes, I reckon. They live in Mary Hill. We have the address. Did you know that Cassie was the only child to draw a tree? I'm afeard her readin' ain't too good. Oh, she'll learn. She has a very high intelligence rating. There might be another problem though. The school doctor is coming in on Tuesday morning. Can you be here then? - She's sick? - No, not a bit. The doctor's just going to examine her eyes. I gotta see Reuben's teacher, Mrs. Stringer. She's down the corridor to the right, room number 14. I'll return your basket this afternoon. Mrs. Nevels. Mrs. Stringer? I come to see you about my young'un, my boy. You'll have to hurry. I've been talking to mothers all afternoon. Child's name? Reuben Nevels. Well, what's the matter? He just don't seem happy. You hill...you Southern people who come up here, don't you realize it will be a great change for your children? Well, Reuben has not accepted the change. I'm giving him a U in conduct. He just won't get along with other children. But he weren't never bad to fight. Last week, Mrs. Nevels, a small boy with a toy gun was teasing Reuben, just poking at him in fun. And Reuben completely lost his temper. Then he bragged about having a real gun of his own and shooting at a bear. Now, of course the boy called him a liar and Reuben slapped him down. Now I sent Reuben to the principal and he was punished. I will not have lying and arrogance in my class. Reuben weren't lying. He's had him a rifle since'd he were 10 year old. And all my young'uns was taught never to point a toy gun. Case one day they might forget and use a real one thatta way. That's very interesting but I see no point in continuing this discussion. Reuben is in Detroit now, he will have to adjust to his surroundings. That's the most important thing in life. That's what you're learning my young'uns? Of course. So's if one day they was to go to Germany, they... they could adjust? Learn to get along with them Nazis and Hitler? How dare you twist my words that way! I'm much obliged to you for your time, ma'am. You can't roll out people like biscuit dough. What's that first letter, Cassie? - Z. - Good. Now the next line. O? Not quite. It's got a tail. What's an O with a tail, like a piglet? Q. Right! And the letter next to it? P. Well now, let's try a little magic, shall we? Here, let's slip these on, there behind your ears. There we go. I'm gonna put a lens in here. There we are. And now. It's a Q, then an R, then a T, then a P, then an N. Very good, nothing wrong with that eye. Put there, and this one in there and now read. X, M, F, A, K, L. Well, you certainly know your letters. Can you read? Some. If'n the print's big. Callie Lou can't neither. Well you send her to me and we'll show her the magic. - All right? - She's right there! Well of course, it's so dark in here. It's nice to have a friend, huh? Okay. I'm gonna put this one in here, very easy. I want you to read this, try that. "The Lord is my..." Shepard. "Shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. He restored my soul." Oh, Ma, he's in trouble! You know he ain't supposed to walk anywhere there ain't patrols. And Reuben just took off on his own, across all kinds of streets he shouldn't've. He cut across that land by the railroad. Don't sound so terrible to me. And Miss Stringer seen 'im! And us young'uns, kids, ain't supposed to walk by the railroad tracks! Well maybe he misses the fields and the woods. How'd you do today, Miss Cassie Marie? Miss Vashinski had me read in front of the whole class. Ma, Ma, Reuben's gonna get a lickin'! Hush now, you'll wake your pa! Hey, what's the racket here? Reuben walked home on the fifth by the railroad tracks. Where we ain't allowed to walk! She was real pleased, Ma! And she gave a story book to bring home, look! I'm gonna read it to Callie Lou. - ...get him a lickin'! - Reuben! - Reuben? - Clovis. Reuben! Come in here! What's going on? You gotta walk where they tell you to walk! It's for your own safety. The way y'all are carrying on about it, think I killed a man! You walk where they tell you to walk. What's the matter with you, boy? You always in trouble. It ain't my fault! The young'uns don't like me, Miss Stringer, she hates me. And now she hates me worse than ever 'cause you come bawling her out saying I wasn't happy. She made fun of me in front of everybody. Things was bad enough 'fore you come sticking your big nose in! No Clovis, don't! You get in your room till you can come out here and apologize to your mama! Rest of you young'uns, clear out! Clytie, turn the radio on good and loud for Reuben. So he'll have something to listen to in his room. I ain't gonna have him talking to you like that. What'd you go raise a racket with that teacher for? You don't know nothing about schools. Rest of the kids is doing all right. You've set Reuben against Detroit so's he hates school and everything else! It's you as much wrong with him as anything. Bye! He ain't never been this late before. Clytie and me ain't seen him all day. This one's all black and squishy. Yuck! Ma's trying to feed us rotten bananas! Try another one. They're always trying to make a fast buck off of you, Ma. Your Mom ain't used to buying. Y'all get rid of that and go do your homework. Gertie, I think we better call the police. No, he'll come. I know he'll come, he's just waiting somewheres, afeared to come home. Well, I gotta go to work. If he ain't here when I get back, I'm calling the cops. Gertie, we're awful fools, Reuben's all right. "Dear Pa, I took 20 dollars to pay my way back. I hope it don't run you short on the car payments. I don't steal, I will pay it back. Back home, I can work and trap for Grandpa. I can't stay here no more. Your ever loving son, Reuben." I'm glad. Found it in my mail hole at work. "Go on home and tell ya wife," the foreman said to me. Who would've thought a foreman would have so much heart. Aw honey, you set up all night working on this thing? The Christ all whittled outta one piece. You coulda made a flat cross in half the time with a flat Jesus Christ glued on top. A jigsaw is what you need. They'll cut out anything, by the dozen. Jesus Christ is jumping jacks, it's all the same to a jigsaw. Have another, Callie Lou. Cassie Marie. Victor! Don't forget Callie Lou. Hey, Gert! Look what I found! It's finished. Let me see. He looks so sad, Ma. This one's gonna be laughing. Well, I don't know, Cassie Marie. Maybe he will. Ma, can I have a nickel for a popsicle? We're the onlyest kids in the alley that hasn't got one. Enoch. Thanks, Victor! Me too, me too! Cassie! Where'd you learn to do that? My old man, he knew lots of tricks. He was a little man, was quick. I was big like an ox so, he just learned me the one. Here Gert, you can buy yourself some pretty shoes. And Max, she's crazy about shoes. 10 dollars will near pay for a hog. A hog, wh...? Not for here! I'm saving for when we go back home. She put a lot of work in that. I know it. You heard from Reuben? He's living with my folks helping on their farm. Ah, it'll be better for him. There's some people don't never do good outside their country. Like my mom. Well, thanks, Gert. I wish Reuben would've gone to my folks. Your mama will work him like a mule, give him no schooling. Like she done you. Won't be forever. We'll be goin' back home pretty soon. Once the war's over. Home to what? I can hear 'em all now, especially your mama. "Poor Gert, back here with that tinkerin' Clovis and not a nickel to his name." Tinkering, I'll show 'em there's money in tinkering. You wanna stay here? Of course I wanna stay here, I got a good job. Young'uns is all in school. We never had that with me hauling coal and you scrabbing on that farm. You be better off watching over Cassie. She run by me just now gibberin' and a-jabberin' to the thin air. She's doing real well in school since she got them eyeglasses. You can't hardly stop her reading now. You better stop that foolishness of her talking to herself. Folks are thinking she's choir. You don't make her quit, you'll have another Reuben. And she can't run home. Oh, Ma, you know what that greedy Callie Lou done? She ate up all my popsicle. Now that's enough of that, Cassie Marie, you stop playing that silly game. I ain't a-playing. Don't be sassing me, just quit. You know they ain't no Callie Lou. Now mind me honey. Honey, back home you never did have nobody to play with but Jep, so you thought up Callie Lou. But you're a big girl now, you can't go around talking to yourself anymore. Ma, don't you like Callie Lou no more? Cassie, go out and play with others now. Your pa's right, there ain't no Callie Lou. Got a clean shirt old, woman? Me and Whit's going to a meeting. That union again. Union means as much as a job up here, you just be glad I'm doing good in it. T'ain't right! Gertie, you don't know nothing about it. This ain't like back home. I don't mean your old union. I mean Cassie Marie. A body's gotta have something of their own. I'll be back for supper. Ma, why don't you like Callie Lou no more? I bet you can see little girls in my eyes Cassie Marie. Don't cry, Callie Lou, you're a big girl now! Stay over them little trees across the track. I'll come see you whenever I can. Ma, I'm starved! Hi ho, silver! A fiery horse with a speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty high ho silver! The Lone Ranger! Aw, Ma! A body can't hear theirselfs think. Cassie Marie, come and eat something. Come on, honey. I ain't hungry, Ma, can I just stay out and play? You eat something first. A daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains... What's the matter, honey? Oh Ma, I wet on myself right in the classroom and all the kids laughed at me. Aw, that's nothing. Don't fret. You want clean pants? Ms. Vashinski washed em out for me and dried 'em in the teacher's room. Don't tell Clytie. Come here. Aww. Ma, I can't hear The Lone Ranger! Can I go out and play? I guess so, honey. What was that? It's at the end of this note. I'll read it to you. He says, "Always remember this, one man plus courage is a majority." One man plus courage is a majority. Why, that's wonderful! But who is he, did he sign his name? It's written right here, The Lone Ranger. Now children, this word is skip. Do what it tells you. Frankie Daly, what's this next word? - Jump! - You dumb kid, that says sit. Cassie, what's this next word? I don't know. Come on, you see good with them specs on! I don't know! All right stupid, then ask Callie Lou! Come on, Cassie, what does she say? There ain't no Callie Lou. Cassie? Cassie Marie? I have a surprise for you and Callie Lou, come on Cassie. Come feed that hungry child of yours. Cassie? Cassie? Cassie, honey, get back from there! Cassie Marie! Cassie, get back! The train's moving! You fell, you fell, I didn't! Come on. Cassie! Oh, Cassie! Cassie! Come on, you bad young'un, I'm taking you home. You sit right there, you mind me now. Cassie! Lady! Get outta there! What are ya crazy? No! Cassie! - What happened? - Over here! - Mama! - Cassie! - Cassie? - It hurts, Ma! Oh, Ma! Help me! Help me, somebody! Help me try to stop the bleeding! We gotta stop it! This way, quick! Outta the way! You gonna be okay, Cassie Marie. It's all right. It's all right. Can you go a little faster, please? I can't see, Ma! It's dark! We'll be going home soon, honey, you and Callie Lou. You can run with Jep and climb trees, hmm? We'll sit all day and have school and tea parties, while you're getting well. Every day and every minute, you can play with Callie Lou, I promise. Ma'am, I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. Where are you taking her? No, no! - We gotta move. - Where are you taking her? - Where are you taking her? - Gertie! I wanna take her home. I wanna take her home! Gertie! - Gertie. Gertie! - Oh, Clovis! No, no, no! - Gertie? - No! Let go, lady. They keeps 'em free overnight. Leave her stay, Gert, them undertakers murders ya, it's money every minute. Money? I got money! I got money, Clovis! Can we take her if we pay? Won't it do? - Honey. - Ain't it enough? I wanna take her home! She's gone! - No. No! - Gertie, here, drink this. No! Gertie? Doctor says you gotta sleep. Go to sleep, honey. Gertie? Gert! Here. I can't never get this part right. You'll have to set up. Where's Amos? He's playing. Where is he? Amos! Gert, you've been in here two weeks. Don't you go outside. Taking him right next door to play with Wheateye. It's all right, Ma, we'll hold both his hands. Get up now, Gert, these kids need ya. Got a dream for me, kid? Sheesh, let some air in here! Listen, you gotta listen! It's spring kiddo. War's about over, I need you. I need a dream. Victor's aiming to buy a house and have his mom move in with us and I ain't gonna eat them Polish dumplings all the rest of my life. You gotta start dreaming again, Gert. It's something can't nobody take away from you. What's this they giving you? Goofballs in water. You got a hole in your life and that ain't the way to fill it. Now get up! Or I'm gonna send Victor's ma in here to feed you dumplings, yuck! I'll be back tomorrow to help you clean up your room. Hey, what's the dream? Same as yours, home. Hi, Ma! Feeling better? A little. Hey, old woman. Enoch's planting a garden for you, Ma. They're giving out grass seed and fertilizer at the project office. A garden? It'll cost a heap. I got some money from babysitting. You short on cash? We on strike. Now it's all right, getting strike pay, but ain't much left over. We had to burn your coat, but there wasn't nothing left inside. They took it all, Gertie, for Cassie. Them cops sent us to an undertaker, it wasn't so good. All of it? It's all gone? Can't we have a garden? I'll do all the digging. It won't last long, Gertie. Cooper says they'll break soon. We just gotta hang on. That's union. Union's just folks looking out for theirselves. Like Tom says, people ain't rabbits. Rabbits never make a sound until you kill 'em and it's just one little squeak. You want me to be a rabbit? I got the grass seed. They gimme some flower seeds too. What kind? Well, I asked the lady that, she looked me like I was crazy and said flowers. Look at the big strong man, Callie Lou. How much for cabbages? Uh, 15. Turnips? 10 cents a pound. I'll take six pound. Six pound. You no sick now? I'm better. You want-a some flower? No money. These, these not so hot, you take anyway. Turnip for 60 cents. Ma, Ma! The radio says we beat the Germans! Oh, wonderful! What's all that racket? The war's over. Victor found a house, he put a payment on it. Got a big lilac bush in the yard. My mom, she come live with us now. Glen's protection men are real buzzards. It's gonna get rough, real rough. Look here, old woman, got a present for you. Tom here helped me get the parts. You got nothing else to do. It's a jigsaw, Ma! Watch! You can turn em out by the dozens now. Jesus Christs, jumping jacks, anything you want! Don't have to waste all that time whittling. You make a pattern, I'll cut out the parts, Kids can string them together. I ain't got no wood. I know a place where you can get 'em cheap! Gotta keep it quiet though. We ain't supposed to run power tools in the projects. Enoch, get me some coal. Amos, come here. The company knows damn well their only chance is to hit Bender. We're covering him day and night. Night's when they'll try it. You want me to help out? Fine, but I warn you, these guys are animals. Wait a minute. Ma, I can't breathe. It's all trash, it's just fit for kindling. Just look around! Ma! I bet they's maple, ain't they? Ain't that good for jumping jacks? That'll do just fine. Don't let on you want 'em. Lemme do it! Mister, us Cub Scouts is building us a little denhouse, could you gimme something cheap? There's some old smashed boxes over there, no good for nothing. Smart kid. Them's government bins. Solid maple. Real good. You just buy 'em for scrap, don't you? I don't buy nothing, lady. I get paid for hauling it out, fire risk. Ah, whatever you can load in that wagon, one dollar. And I don't lend hammers and screwdrivers. Gertie, you come up. The number you gimme, 800 dollars! I said you'd be lucky for me. I'm taking off 'fore I get scared. You can't just go. - Where are you gonna sleep tonight? - In a bus headed for the ocean. I grew up by the ocean. Victor's Ma, she ain't never even seen it. She ain't never been outta Detroit. She wants to stay stuck in this dump all her life. Honey, you're 19 years old. You need somebody. Ain't you got no people to go to? I don't need nobody. I learned that in there. Victor's Ma can find him a nice Polish girl. I wish you'd been my people. Max, he's a good man. I'll write you. One more time! This all? They cut the strike pay. Had to put money on the car. There's only two payments to go. Ma, I sold four jumping jacks! And a cop took one! A cop in a squad car. He stopped and asked what I was doing. And I said, wouldn't he like a doll for his little girl? He said, how did I know he had little girl? But he laughed and he kept it. You done real good honey, but there's only 7.50 here. Well, I didn't ask him for no money. You're learning, son. Cops earn more than strikers. I'm gonna have a cop speaking to me personal now. Just like Mr. Daly. Gert? Where'd she go? I don't know. She said she'd write. She'd come back to me, if I could find her. Gertie? You know...why she left? Maybe 'cause she didn't belong. Okay. Oh honey, what you done to it? Pa done it. Don't you like it? Well, it's ugly. Howdy, Gert. We can't afford foolishness like paints. Now don't jump on me. That's to help with your dolls. I'll save you a lot of time whittling. Is time gonna buy groceries? Look at this, Clovis. That's all I got left after paying last month's rent and by rights, this month's is due. How am I gonna buy food? Get credit, like everybody else. You're so mule headed about that. You can get stuff on account, down at the store. Make ya pay back double, like they done ya at all the other stores. We can pay it off when the strike's over. You're good with money. Lord, the money you saved, if that damned crooked funeral parlor hadn't'a took it all. With what Henley left you, you must had over 600 dollars. Enough to buy a piece of land. If I'd'a knowed you had all that, I'd of said buy a place and wait for me. Then when the war was over, I'd'a come rolling in. We'd have been all set. You always hated the farm. Clovis, you'd'a spent that money for a truck. I know'd you would. You sold the cow for tires. I couldn't see you working and working and always giving away half of it. I wanted you to have what you wanted. Oh, for God's sake Gertie, don't waste all that time whittling on 'em. You want 'em quick and cheap, paint 'em. Don't tell me what to do! All my life, I've been doing what I was told. First Ma and then you. Well 16 year, I dreamed of us having our own farm and I worked and I saved up and you said, "Come to Detroit!" You never cared what I wanted. You never asked! You left home with your bag all hidden away didn't you? You planned on not coming back! And now look, we're stuck in this hole! Owing money all around and you on strike with your precious union! And Reuben gone and Cassie, Cassie Marie, oh. You've gone your own way always, Clovis, and I've had to go too. Well, these dolls... this is all that's feedin' our young'uns now and their mine! Don't you tell me to do it your way. I ain't doing it no more. Turn out the light! Open the door! We gotta get him to a hospital! - Keep your voice down. - He ain't bad hurt. What happened? They jumped us outside of Bender's house. They got him on the head. - The blood's from his scalp, that's all. - Did...did you call the police? Are you kidding? Flint's got the cops in his pocket, this is Detroit, honey. Easy, easy. Gert, are they back? Clovis got his self hurt. Trouble, you hunt it. Well, I figure the union's worth a little trouble. You gotta learn to look behind you, buddy. Whit, that old boy you popped. Yeah, he ain't getting up in a hurry. Whadda you mean? It means we got trouble. A lot of eyes out there lookin'. - Did they see ya car? - No, it was Clovis'. Will they set the cops on you? - We all gotta get outta site for a while. - Ain't no place to go! Guy I know with a farm outside of town needs a tractor rebuilt. Now, I was going to take Clovis. - It's about a week's work. - Is it safe? Sure, it's safe. Now you get a good sleep and I'll come by for ya in the morning. How are you gonna get by? We'll manage. Shoulda got me up. You didn't sleep much. I'll be gone a week or so. I'll write you. It's a farm so maybe I can bring some stuff back. Uh-huh. It's here. Gertie, I wish I'd never seen Detroit. I tried to work for us the best way I knew how, nothing come out right. We'll get back home one day. I swear we will. I love you, honey. You just take care of yourself. Pa? Are you leaving now, Pa? - Bye, Pa. - Bye, son! Honey, our car is parked out in the alley. Wish you'd move it before they come repossess it. Can't make a payment until I get this job done. Take care of your mama now. Yes, sir. Look at the strikers, Amos. Watch out, Miss Nevels, you can't cross our picket lines. You'll be at scab. Can't you read dummy? You've crossed the picket lines. Sorry, I'm sorry! Come on, Mr. Skyros, I'll take care of ya. Thank you, Wheateye. It's all right, Mrs. Nevels. I'm being well looked after. Hello. If it's not an inconvenience, you just said I might look at some of your work. Of course! Please come in, Mr. Skyros. - Thank you. - Amos? Someday he'll have a face. I can't seem to find it. It's there. Waiting. Oh, beautiful! Have you made any more of these? I ain't got time for such as that no more. Could you have? What do you mean? Do you remember that friend that I mentioned? That admired your little bird so much. He has a store downtown and he asked if he could commission you to make some for him. How long would it take you to say, make 50 of them? - 50? - Uh-huh! He's convinced that he could sell a great many of them. He could only pay you 4.50 a piece, which is far less, of course, than their worth. I go pretty quick! When I got me the time. Just go at your own speed. Ask the children to let me know when you've made maybe, a dozen. He sent you 50 dollars for the wood that you'll need. I know how difficult these days are for you. And you must promise that you're going to finish this. Well, I won't keep you, must be supper time. Mr. Skyros? - Thank you. - Privilege. Clovis Nevels? - He ain't to home. - You Mrs. Nevels? - Uh-huh. - You got a boy down in Kentucky? Reuben! You have to call him, we got a message. - What happened? - Officer in Kentucky said it was an emergency. You can phone from the station if you like. I'll come with you, Ma! Hello? Reuben? Here's Ma. Reuben! What's wrong, you alright? Ma? Grandpa died. Ma, you there? When did he die? Yesterday morning. I found him in his workshop. And Auntie Mag's here. Grandma's going back with her. Did you get my... Reuben? Honey? I can't hear you! Hello? Hello? Here, sit down. We ain't had no letter. No. What'd it say? Reuben? Hello? I'm sorry, Ma. Police. What? Oh, okay, thank you. 2.50. The call costs 2.50, Ma. I ain't got no money with me. I'll bring it to you. You've got a boy that sells dolls? - Enoch. - Yeah, Enoch. He's a smart kid. He gimme a doll. My kid got so mad. She tried right off to take it apart and when she couldn't, she threw it at me. Can't get it away from her now. Can I bring it to you tomorrow? Forget the money. You get your ma on home. She's all tore up. And don't you let your kid brother go selling after dark or get into no cars with no strangers. Oh, we know about that. We've been here a long time. ♪ Take the keys and lock her up, lock her up ♪ ♪ Take the keys and... ♪ Look, Ma, it's from Reuben! That's what he must'a meant. Read it, honey. "Dear Ma, I am writing for Grandpa. He is very sick. All Grandma does is cry and say you deserted them. She wants to sell the farm and go live with Auntie Mag. Grandpa says if he dies the farm is yours and she must not sell it. But if you don't come, she will sell it because she says what I do is not enough. I am writing because Grandpa told me to. Your loving son, Reuben." Is Reuben there all alone? Reuben's got sense. Honey, look after Amos for me. Come on, Enoch, I need you to give me a hand. Honey, you've been to the car lot with your pa to make payments, ain't ya? Sure! Down past the mill, Josephson's. Just point me in the right direction. What for? Tell me the way. Not even one more week? But it's near all paid off. No way, lady, cash on time that's our rules. You got till Friday or we repossess. Lookit, Ma! It's just like Pa's truck, only newer! Not so new as your car, Sonny. You'll find some way to keep this, you got any sense. If I can get the money to pay off the car, would you swap it for that truck? - Lady, you're crazy. - Would ya? Sure I would. I want somebody to check it over first. We ain't got nothing to hide. How much we owe? 52 dollars with tax. - Ma! - Shh! Will you throw in a spare tire? Sure, why not? Tools? And a jack? Don't push your luck, kid. I'm gonna go make out the papers, lady. You wanna come to the office? - Put in about having it looked over. - Yeah. Ma, that was your money for wood. How you gonna make dolls? Gonna go see your scrap wood man. He ain't got nothing. Well, it won't hurt none to look. Who you gonna have check out the truck? Victor, when he comes off shift. Looks okay to me. Good Lord, Gert, why you want a truck? Well, I'll tell you tomorrow. I gotta get me some wood. Wood? Now you listen to me. When Max was a young'un, did she live near the sea? Some place in Mississippi. Biloxi. If you can leave your ma, that's where you oughta look. She went home. Ma, where are we going? To see Cassie Marie? We're just going out whilst Clytie and Enoch are playing. I'm gonna need to borrow your wagon. It's outside. Want a cup of coffee, Gert? Later maybe. I got me a errand to do. Heard from Clovis? No, you hear from Whit? They'll make out. How's the merry-go-round? Still going around, me with it. At least we got my money coming in. Open the door, Amos! Looks like you almost finished. Not quite. Where you taking it? To show to a fella. Can me and Callie Lou come too? Why sure. You get a good price now! What's that? Where you taking him? You make that? You leave 'em be! Ain't ya gonna give him no face? Maybe it's there if'n you look real hard. What's it look like? Maybe like your ma. My Ma? Or Wheateye's Ma. Maybe like you, Frankie. Like most anybody. I don't buy nothing. I ain't selling. Whadda you got there? Cherry wood. It's Christ, ain't it? I'd like it sawed up for whittling. Small pieces, 50 of 'em. When you was so near finishing? I'm just beginning. I'd like it sawed up now. Got to be split first. Pull the wagon, honey. Here. I ain't gonna do it. You'll have to do better than that, lady. I'll get you a wedge.
