Damn, Mára! - You're out here shooting, huh? - Yeah. - Where you going? - Well... - Right, it's secret. - Top-secret, man! - I won't tell, I'm no prick. - Bullshit, man. I won't! Let me come. I won't tell, I swear. - Why can't I? - Because you're Hedua, man. What the hell are you doing? Hedua, let go! Get the fuck off! Now! Let me come. Let me come! Let go! Get off! Fucking hell, Hedua! Let me come. Let me come. I wanna come with you. - Please. - Whatever. Thanks. You're a douchebag, dude. A total douche. I ain't taking you back, dude. You can fucking hitchhike. Hey, you drive pretty good. I could drive before I could walk. My grandpa taught me. Wow, Mára... - Is this you guys car? - Hell no. I jacked it. I didn't think I'd get it started, man, but then I just hotwired it. Wow! - This is totally dope! - There was no other way. I wouldn't take off if I didn't have to, man. But I have to. Yeah. - Dude, I could go with you. - No way. I could join the French Foreign Legion. Then your parents will come looking, and you'll get in trouble. They won't. They're visiting my aunt in Ostrava. Got any money, dude? - Yep. - On you? Yeah, right here. Okay, fine, man. But we're skipping big towns, and you gotta lose that paint. What's it gonna be? Come on, start talking! Where did you boost the Audi from? We found the owner: - Jolana Mikulová of Bílina. - Well, well... Bílina. Things are moving along, eh, kid? Whether we want them to or not. Surprise, surprise. - Coffee's gone. Want tea? - I don't drink tea. I'll go check out the car. I never boosted nothing in my life. Yeah, sure. Hedua, we gotta ditch our phones. Otherwise, dude, they'll find us. Sure, Mára. Come on, man, you're so slow. Just a minute... You don't know where your phone is? I'm looking for it. Here it is. Okay, three... two... one... Yeah! Do it! Okay, three... two... one... Yeah! Jeez, I almost fell in. - You're taking a bath, dude. - I don't smell that bad. Shut up and strip! - I'm not going in. - You are. - I'm not. - Yeah, you are. - Strip! - Why? You're going in. That's mine! It's mine! Come on! Freedom. Finally. I need you to take a look. Yeah, the car is your jurisdiction. I still don't know about the boy. When does your partner get back? What's that? It's mine. It's just camo for the woods. Is this yours too? Yeah. Some guys like girls, some guys like girls' sweaters. Sweaters... skirts... Maybe the young man is the type who likes to dress up. Are you a tranny in training, kid? Maybe you're a fag. Eh? Slip into high heels, eh? Nylons? Go ahead, show us. Actually, I knocked up a girl. She's underage. - Aha... - Nobody's gonna pin it on me. I'm not stupid. I'm going to town for something to eat. The police in Bílina said they'd look up Ms. Mikulová. Bye. Can I stand up? - Yes. - Great. - I just don't wanna right now. - Stand up whenever you want. You don't stand a chance against him, by the way. When we find out that you don't know the car owner, we'll put out an APB. Your picture and description will be sent out into the world. - Over by tomorrow at the latest. - What is? Everything. What was it like? - What? - Her pussy. - Whose? - The girl we're running from. Damn, you never seen nothing like it. Big, of course, at least XXL. - Perfectly shaved, dude. - Completely shaved, huh? Wow... Shit! We're screwed, man. Nowhere to turn off. Road workers... Just chill, man. My grandpa always said, Stay calm, don't shit yourself. So you drove the whole way alone? Yeah, just me and my ride. I don't get why people always gotta be with somebody. I'm fine by myself. I could last, like, maybe a whole year alone. On some island. Maybe three years. - On an island? - Even up a tree, no problem. Come on, man... Hey, soldiers. Hello. - Where're you from? - Around here. Bull, I'd know you. We don't know you either. - Hey, boys, want to buy a puppy? - What puppy? This one. Inherited with the house, but for you I'll let it go separate. - That's a puppy? - Sure. A year-old purebred. A purebred German shepherd crossed with a mongrel sheep. Or German shepherd and toilet brush. Good for burger meat. - Ground up with ketchup. - Watch you mouths, you punks. I bet you cleaned your exhaust pipe with that mutt. Who do you think you are, smart ass? I'm calling the cops. Let it go. Let it go! Go ahead, we'll tell them you threatened us. We'll tell them you tried to molest us. Goddamn punks. Pervert! Damn, what's he doing, man? - Maybe training him. - With a pipe? Asshole! Maybe it's endurance training. Goddamn, what's he doing? What a prick! What a motherfucker! A total dipshit. - Maybe he'll swim. - Yeah, straight to the bottom. - Your mom must be worried sick. - Fake news. She's just fine. She's got TV, Facebook, the ladies at Kaufland, cosmetics... Your mom works at Kaufland supermarket? Yep. She also sells makeup. She couldn't care less. What do you mean? You must put her through the wringer. Me? She's used to it. I take off all the time. She knows where I go. Where? But this is the first time you took a car, isn't it? Bílina precinct? Guys, what's going on? He's not back yet? Yeah, Ms. Mikulová. Okay, thanks. The dog was totally in shock, it was terrible. Like dead. - So it died? - Course not. And the pipe? It just fell off. Fell off? - By itself? - Sure. I think I'd know if I cut it. - It was just tied bad. - So it got lucky. Yeah, it did. Lucky as shit. Knock it off! Cut it out! Enough already, I mean it. He looks just like The Castle. That was my grandpa's last dog. Gramps always had a dog. And he always named it after a friend from the Resistance. - Really? - Yeah, like Tesar, Sochor, Roudnick... The last one was named after the whole group: The Castle. Mára, look! A girl hitchhiking. She looks hot, dude. Hey, we could fuck her together. Damn, Hedua... - Hi. - Hi. - Where to? - Nowhere with you two. Go after her, man. - What're you doing? - You're coming with us. - I said no! - It'll be fun. Are you some psycho? You freak! Is there a problem? - We're both adults. - What? We been adults a long time. - And you can drive, huh? - Sure. - Get in. - Really. We could drive before we could walk. Where you from? - The Krkonoae mountains. - All alone? I am now. Yep, you are now. Hey, we're alone too. And, like, what did he do to you? - He acted like a jerk. - Right. Kept going on with his macho bullshit. Macho? They're fucking assholes, those machos. I'm Mára and that's Hedua. Bára. - I'm Pavel. - Pavel, huh? Oh god... - And this? - That's Jackal. He's specially trained. But don't worry, he obeys my command. - Shit, Mára, cops up ahead. - Shit! We're screwed, man! - Turn off somewhere. - Shut up, man! Where can I turn? Put it in neutral and we'll switch. What?! - You got it? - Yeah. Hurry! - Registration? - Above you! Shit... - Great, we did it. - Son of a bitch! This is some trip... Won't that kill them? They love it. Want some? Okay. I thought you were on a hunger strike. One little bird gets a worm. Another little bird gets a worm. And Jackal gets the crust. Good dog. Pig! They shoot you for that in China. Screw him... Screw everybody. I'm doing just fine. Hey, what about us? You're fine. Where're you going? To pee. - Think she's gonna put out? - She's thirsty for it, man. Awesome. Man, what a prick. - It got pretty cold, huh? - Not at all. - I'm sleeping in the car, okay? - Sure. Choose a place. Put the seats back, right? - Choose a position. - Hey, he's wants in too! Come on, we'll warm each other up. Jump right in. Good dog! - Mára? - What? - What now? - What? Are we gonna fuck her? Damn, Hedua, a chick ain't a cow. Gotta be, like, foreplay, right? - What? - I imagined fucking a cow. God, you really are a dork. A chick ain't a Coke machine, man: Drop in some coins and out pops a pussy. You gotta go slow, give her time. They all want it different, man. Okay, I'm going for it. Didn't you hear what I just said? Damn, Mára, she locked the door. - She locked herself in. - You gotta be kidding. She must be asleep. Bára? - Bára! - Open up! - She's asleep. - Open up! Wake up, Bára! - Fuck, Bára! - Wake up! She was totally slammed from the breakup. - Broken to pieces. Like Lego. - Where was this? The woods. Nothing anywhere. The end of the world. Tears... "Help me, Mára! Nothing matters anymore! I don't know what to do!" I comforted her all night, if you know what I mean. By morning she'd forgot all about him. - Ow, that hurts! - Where were you! Near Hradec I guess. - What do you want, man? - The sleeping bag. - Take the backpack. - I want a sleeping bag too. - Stop it, it's your fault. - No, it's not. Shoes off! Damn, Hedua... Okay, hold on... I'm getting in too. Wait, don't lie down yet. - Knock it off! - I'm getting in too. No, you're not. Lie down on the ground. I'm on the ground too. - Can you move over a little? - No! Okay, goodnight. What are you doing now? Get out of the sleeping bag! I'm c-c-cold! Can I come in a little? Good morning! You got something there. Here... - And here too. - Are you okay? Can I have another pickle? It's... It's orange... It's small and orange. It can be big and orange too. But it's small and orange. Contact: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, tangerine! - P... e... - Pe... Pedophile! -No. - Peyote? - No. Then I drove her to her cottage. She was totally dope, man. She wanted me to, like, stay there with her. But tough luck. I did catch some fish for her. I took three days off work for you. Okay. Where's the cottage? You were near Hradec so where's the cottage? - In the Highlands. - In the Highlands... So in Jihlava, Humpolec, Havlíckuv Brod, Zdár... Where? Here. So you think it was closer to Jihlava or where? Here. - Here, huh? - Here. Aha... So we're playing games. I dare you to touch it. I caught it! Don't be scared, man. Take it! - You're such a dork. - It's right there. I got it. Does it bite? Take it by the gills so you don't drop it. I got it... Yuck! Oh, man... Too bad she didn't put out. Maybe she'll put out if we stay with her. One more night and she's mine. Exactly, she's ours. - Hey, a motorcycle. - Yep. Must be a visitor. Where'd he come from, man? - Maybe she knows him. - No way, man. Get off me! Cut it the fuck out! - You know him? - Never seen him before. - What the fuck is this? - Perverted jerk! Move and I'll drill your balls so they string like beads! You're going to jail for attempted murder! You're going to jail, you creep! Just try trashing the place, jerk! - I'll make you regret this! - Asshole. Jackal! Damn, Bára, the guy's like some perverted douche, and you were dancing for him. - Drop it. - No way, man. Another minute of that striptease and your tits would've been out. - Shut up. - You're all goody-goody with us. We thought you'd put out for us since... Shut up! Or at least strip for us. - Pull over. - What's wrong? - Pull the fuck over! - You offended or what? I'm getting out. Pull over. Dammit, pull over! Pull over! - Now we'll never see her tits. - And whose fault is that, man? At least we can fuck her sweater. You're fucking insane, you psycho. We can each have a sleeve. Dude, I'm not some fucking perv. Retard. Don't look, man. Why do they call the principal The Cuntster? - Why do you think? - Because he's a cunt? Yeah. But mainly because he can't keep his hands off the pussy. Mára, how'd you ever shit on his car? I ran away too when I was your age. My dad was a drunk who beat my mom till she divorced him. Sometimes he beat her up so bad she couldn't go to work the next day. After she finally divorced him she turned against me. She once told me she wished I'd never been born. Damn. She used to lock me in the basement for two or three days. There wasn't even a window. If I got thirsty I drank the juice from pickle jars. Then I'd pee back into the same jar. What a bitch. Where'd you really go? Goddammit! I can't stand it. They're everywhere. - What is it? - A fly. - I'll revive it. - Don't bother. I really can. We gotta light another cig. Okay. My turn. - Get it right on it. - Okay. So it's completely covered. - Like that? - Yeah. My grandpa showed me how. I couldn't believe it. - What now? - We gotta wait. Too bad she didn't give us her number. I coulda sent her a selfie from the Foreign Legion. Screw the Foreign Legion. You trying to get bullied? Let's drive to the beach in France. They don't bully you in the Legion. My grandpa told me. He's in touch with people in NATO. - What kind of bullshit is that? - What do you mean bullshit, man? They could listen in. Gramps got a jammer on his phone. Shit yeah! We're here Hedua. - Where? - Skalice. - I wanna go to France. - We will. We can stay here as long as we want. My grandpa can help us train Jackal. - I thought we were running away. - Course we are. France is better. The bitches there are the best fuckers in the world. Bullshit, man. We'll just say hi and leave Jackal here with him. Grandpa! Grandpa! Gramps! We can get in through the garage. This was my first car: A Volga 24. Never breaks down. 40° outside and it turns over like a dream. Minus 40, huh? Grandpa? Grandpa's command headquarters. He plans everything here. The top military brass come visit him here. They were pushing him to become Minister of Defense. That's where we watch TV. - Does he got any medals? - Tons of them, dude. But they're in the safe because they're fucking valuable. We can overcome long distances and we have incredible endurance. We can fly up to 4800 km just to escape the winter. Most migratory monarchs live in North America, but some of us live in Australia where they call us wanderers. We fly from Canada and the US to Mexico and back again. Many dangers await us along the way. We have to overcome it all in order to arrive at a quiet, warm place to spend the winter. That's my grandpa. Spiders, frogs, birds, and even cats like to eat us. We eat a lot on the way... Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa, what's wrong? Grandpa! Help! Grandpa... Grandpa, it'll be okay, don't worry. Hedua! Help! - Hedua! - Coming! I'm coming... Grandpa... Grandpa... Help! Grandpa... Hold on. Please... Help! If he doesn't make it, man, I'll kill myself. What're you doing? - What the fuck, Hedua? - We gotta do first aid. Are you a fag or what? Damn, Gramps, I thought you were... What's all the fuss? I'm no fag... You brought him here to the hospital? Yeah. I saved his life. It was a heart attack. Even the doctor said so. What's your grandpa's name? What? - What's his name? - What? You think I can't call the hospital? Ask them if some old man came in? So you're just going to keep jerking me around... Czech Police, Officer Freiwaldová. I'd like to ask about patients you admitted today. The one with a heart attack. Thanks, I'll hold. Yes? There were two? One died. Could I get the name? Thank you. One of them died. What's your grandfather's name? What's his name? Frantiaek Pluskal. Is he alive? - Is my grandpa okay? - Your name? Marek Mikule. - Your address? - 292 Lucní Street. Bílina. Your mother's phone number? - Is he okay? - The number. 773 568 352. It's ringing. She's at work. She not allowed to answer. Is my grandpa alive? You think I really called the hospital? You fucking bitch. "Let's go, boys, let's go!" D-Day, France, the Legion, bitches! Piss off, Hedua. Fuck France. We're waiting till my grandpa gets out. - What if he doesn't get out? - What do you mean, man? He's old and sick... Shut up, you asshole. My grandpa isn't sick. Then why'd we have to revive him? Shut up - And take him to the hospital? - Motherfucker! My dad started drinking because of commies like him. Your dad started drinking because of you, you asshole! Look at yourself. Let's go. Come on. Stop! I said stop! Stop! Catch him! Got you! You little shit, don't piss me off. Get up! Move! Stop squirming! How's our little bird? Did he start singing yet? Were you smoking? No. I don't smell anything. - Well? - Yeah, he sang. It's over. He's got an active imagination and a sentimental side. A sentimental side? Tell me more. His name is Marek Mikule and he's from Bílina. He ran away to his grandfather's, Frantiaek Pluskal of Skalice. We have his mom's number; she's on her way. - We were smoking! - Don't lie. His grandfather's here in the hospital. She offered me smokes. I'm filing a complaint. So he drove across the whole country, through Prague? Not through Prague. Move. Move! Through Turnov, down toward Jihlava, then over our way. Good Lord, what a distance. - And no one pulled him over? - No. He could've killed someone. Yeah, but he must've already known how to drive. She was hitting on me. She was touching me. She wanted to have sex. Her DNA's on my T-shirt. Take it and test it. Bílina precinct? Go ahead... Yes, we know... Exactly, just as I thought. It's got to be a practical joke. I'll check it out. Come with me. Move! Wait here. Mára? Hedua? Hedua! Hedua! - Damn, Hedua! - Let's go! - Goddammit! - Stop! Faster! Jackal! Are they behind us? No. - Let's take off. - Shit no, man. We're going home. Shit no, out of the country. - What for? - Money, bitches, everything. Damn, Hedua, you're a real psycho. Look, Mára, cows! - Never seen a cow before? - Yeah, lots of times.
