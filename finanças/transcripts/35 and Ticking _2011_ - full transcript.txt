Leave her bag alone. You guys are so stupid. -Anyway, -Hey, man. Like I was saying, when I get older, I'm gonna marry Prince. I'm gonna marry Michael Jackson. -No, you're not. -Zenobia, you need to be thinking about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Darryl Dawkins. Yeah, you definitely need a giant. That ain't funny, Phil. Why am I laughing? Y'all need to shut up and let go of my bag. Ow! That hurt! You know, if you weren't a girl, I would-- You wouldn't do a thing. Z, you need to pick on somebody your own size. Zen, Zenobia, get back here and leave those stupid boys alone. Let's get her. One day, I'm gonna beat them up. -You always say that. -I'm gonna get you. -I'm tired of all the teasing. -Quit it. I can't help it. I'm tall. I wish I was tall like you because when I get older, I would be a model. You know, models are real tall. I'm not pretty. Yes, you are. You're prettier than me. You're just saying that because we're best friends. No, I'm not. Michael Jackson will never marry me. Prince will never marry me, so we even. -You know what? -What? When we get older, we're both gonna get married, have a bunch of kids, and we're gonna live next door to each other. Yeah, and our daughters can be best friends like us.

You're kidding me, right? -Guys... -What is this? Hey, actually, you know what? Uh, Phil, "this" is an adjective that's used to describe something. You didn't really describe anything. No it's not. "This" is a pronoun that activates a verb. What? No. It's not. You're wrong. "This" is an adjective that's used to accentuate a noun, or it can be used as an adverb or some modifier, okay? Yes. -Okay, you guys, hold up. -A sub-modifier? -A sub-modifier. -Okay, hold up, you guys. You guys, Phil, you know what I'm talking about. No, Vic. What exactly are you talking about?

We've gone through this before, honey. I just don't think it's fair, Okay? I'm drinking two gallons of water a day. I know for a fact that I produce way more than maximum. Cleavon, it's $100 for a donation. Rules are rules. It's not right. It's not right, and you know it's not right. What will it be for you today? Want a DVD or "Busty & Lusty"? That's not funny. What you're doing is not funny. Uh-huh. Hold the train. How about this one, "Booty and the Beast"? -Okay. -Oh, wait, this is real popular. You might like this, "Nasty Neanderthals."

Nothing to see here. [music continues] Thought you was looking out, man. Man, I really don't want no part in this. Can you just go ahead and look out, please? If your father knew you were doing this. Man, water is water. People can taste the difference in the water, bro. No they can't. Your father built this company from the ground up, and you gonna take him down. Will you just go get some more empty bottles, so we can get out of here? You know people can see us, right? You're not invisible. Would you get some bottles, man? [music continues] Come on, man. Phil, I thought that was you. Why you peeking around the corner all crazy? Phil? What's up, TQ? -What's up, Cleavon? -What y'all doing over here? What does it look like? Taking a break. Oh, okay, right. How's you guys working today? I just got off myself. I'm sure you did. Oh, that's funny. Oh, that's really funny. Got two more deliveries, right? -Yes, sir. -Oh, okay. That's it, huh? You done? -Yes. -Cool, cool. Hey, real quick, man, why you always got something to say about my job? -Cleav, it's not a job, bro. -It's not a job? No. It's not a job. Okay, so if I get a check for doing what I do, that doesn't put it in the same category as me having a job? Because I got a check. You don't believe me? I'll show you my check. Oh, in your face. Thank you, check... -It's very nice. -...work. It's a public service that I'm doing for people. -Is that work for or on? -[chuckles] Oh, now, you-- you two are just... You should go on the road with these jokes that you got today. Hey, what happened to that, um, honey from the other night? -Uh, Linda? -Yeah, Linda. -It's Fa, Falinda. -Okay, Fa, Fa, Falinda, -what happened to her? -Messed it up. How's that, Cleav? I didn't get her number, man. Damn, bruh. She was pretty. I don't know she was pretty, Phil? I didn't see her? Come on, man. I just told you I messed up. I already know. Well, maybe you'll see her again. I did some, I'm just gonna tell you, and you tell me how you feel about it. It could be, like, semistalker-ish, but I went and I, uh, I called every nursing school in the county just to try to see if she was enrolled in them, and I didn't come up with nothing, but now I'm scared that if she does enroll, they gonna be like, "This guy called here, like, seven times." Why didn't you just Google her, bruh? You know, Google her, you just... I don't know her last name. -Come on, man. -Not good, bruh. -I know it's not good, Phil. -Got to go, Cleav. Can we go? Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You going to the bowling thing, right, Friday night? -Uh... -Vic is in. Yeah, not gonna be able to make that one. Oh, they're gonna be pissed. They're gonna be pissed at you. Yeah, well, I got to see if Coco has plans. I might need to watch the kids. All right? Okay, why can't Coco call you and see if you have plans? You wouldn't understand, Cleav. -Right. -Now, I got to go. -I got to get back to work... -Okay. -...at a job. -Mm, booyah. TQ, hey, always good to see you. Don't hit the van, man. All right, man. [quirky music] You always have business-management classes. I know. I know. Come on, I do this all the time. -You should be used to that. -But I need-- -Stop tripping. -Girl, they tried to arrest me! So what? Do I look like I give a damn? You told me I could use your car. Yes, I did. Well, why'd you call the police and report it stolen? That ain't even relevant. Girl, do you know I spent a half a day at the police department? Do you see this finger? It's been missing something for the last half decade. Why you keep sweating me? Because you know what? I am so sick and tired of seeing everybody around me getting married, Harold. -Like who? -My cousin Shonda. Francisco married her to get a green card. -What about Janeece and Collin? -Prison weddings don't work! He's doing life! Okay, what about Keisha and Carvel? He married her because your spouse can't testify against you in the court of law. How about that, now, uh? Oh! [slapping] -Green card! -Go! Get back! That's why I ain't marrying you. I got to go. You need to lose the key on that. -Whatever. -Yeah, you need to go somewhere. Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. Open the door. Hey, Callise, let me get my phone. What? You got to be tripping.

[chuckles] -Hmm. -Mm. So sexy, so sexy Take your time, Don't rush your love Don't rush your love The way you put it on me Oh Girl, it affects me It affects me All I want to do is... Oh Oh Mm. Am I worth being late for? Most definitely. -Mm-hmm. -Mm. Baby, you can go ahead and take the car. I'm not gonna have time to get dressed, and I'll just jog over and pick it up later. -You sure? -Yes, baby. I'm gonna take a little nap and get ready for round two tonight. -All right, now. -Yeah. Oh, wait, babe. I'm supposed to meet the fellas after work, so I might be a little late. It's okay. I can wait for you. -That's my girl. -Mm. -See you later. -Have a good rest of the day. -Thank you. -Mm. Jason was thrown out of the game for undercutting Nick on a drive to the basket. Nick West, five-time all-star is here with us today. How are you doing, Nick? Fine, thank you, I mean, considering. Ah, Zenobia, I just want to say, um, Nick West was extremely pleased to meet you the other night. On the tape, it didn't look like Jason was intentionally trying to undercut you. Well, maybe you might need to rewind that highlight film because that was a straight hater move. He was definitely trying to undercut Nick West, and that's why my teammates rushed the floor like they did. You know what I'm saying? [laughter] Well, actually, in the play before, you elbow him in the jaw. Well, Zenobia, I mean, basketball is a man's sport. It's a rough gang. Elbows come with the territory. Plus the referee didn't see that, so no harm, no foul. [laughter] -I guess so. -You know, I just wonder, can I say on national television that you are fine as hell? No, you can't. America, look at Zenobia Cartwright. She is a cold piece of work, capital F, capital I, capital N, capital E, capitals, all capitals, just fine. You know what I'm saying? [laughter] Let's take a look at your conference. Mm, I'd love to have a conference with you. Right now, your team is on top of the division. -How does that make you feel? -Hmm, good. Nick West love to be on top. Don't you? Let's take a look at your game. Do you prefer facing the basket or backing people down? [laughter] Well, Zenobia, you know, Nick West gets it in, and I definitely love to face in the basket, strong to the hole all dang long. Nick West like to go down. You know what I'm saying? -Nick, thanks for coming in. -Mm-hmm. Let's go to Raoul Ramirez with the coverage of the U.S. Open. -Thank you. -Clear. -Really? Really? -What? Calm down, girl. Girl, you know you're too pretty to be all mad and angry like that. We really should go out sometime. -Jimmy! -No, no, no, no, hold up, girl. Why you gotta be all like that? What you, about 5'10", 5'11"? I mean, we could make a cold team, girl. You know what? You don't need to say another other word to me. Why you gotta be like that? Girl, we could have a starting five. I'll put a nice little power forward right all up in... -Will you get... -Hey, oh, hold up! -What the heck? -Don't you put your hands on me! -What the hell wrong with you? -Security!

Endangered species, and it will bite your ass. -Bite your ass. -You got a shoe? I got a shoe, too. I got a shoe, too. You and the rest of the Skittles need to get up and out of here! -I like 'em yelling mad. -Okay. [crickets chirping] Mm, mm. [giggling] [baby crying] Wait, I know you're not stopping. All this crying not distracting you? No. No. Just... She'll stop. Come on. Yeah. Mm. [crying continues] That crying is not bothering you? Ugh. Just get off me and get her before she wakes up PJ. Why don't you go get her? Because I have to make a phone call. [crying continues] I couldn't believe it. Cathy said she was gonna come down there and kick his ass. She might be corporate, but she got some hood in her. I love working for a black woman. The reason why I don't want to get married! Just shut up and pull your pants down! Put your pants on the ground! This is the last time you gonna do this to me here. -You know what? -Here. Get your hand out the way! Will you get your hand out the way? They smell like soap! How the hell they gonna smell like soap, Harold? You been working all day! I went home, and I took a shower. You didn't have time to go home for lunch, Harold. Yes, I did. That's a lie, Harold. Why do you smell like Irish Spring? Why does it smell like Irish Spring? Who'd you go to lunch with? I ain't go to lunch with nobody. -You did. Stop lying. -Tired of you... You hate Irish Spring! -...accusing me of cheating, man! Harold, won't you tell the truth? Who you go to lunch with? Huh? I ain't go to lunch with nobody. Well, they ain't supposed to smell soapy. They smell soapy! Okay, now you upset about they smell. First you was saying, "Your balls smell sweaty, they smell sweaty." Now they smell like soap. You mad about that. Harold, who you go to lunch with? I went to lunch with my balls and no soap. -I told you I wasn't cheating. -Crazy. How about I hit the balls with a baby wipe? A baby wipe ain't going to hit them balls. I hit the balls with a baby wipe, I'm telling you. You been working all day, and you gonna swipe it with a baby wipe? This is what it smelled like earlier today. Ew, that's nasty. Now, I'm telling you, I ain't got to lie. My balls have smelled the same since I was 2. Call my mother now and ask her. I don't need to call your mama, I know what your balls smell like, and they don't smell like Irish Spring. -Get the key. -I'm trying! Oh, girl, I can't believe she's giving him the smell test. She is so insecure. I mean, who does stuff like that? Why don't you tell me what this big idea about finding me a man is? -Huh? -Bam. -The Internet? -Yes, girl. Haven't you seen them commercials on television? Girl, please. Girl, I don't do Internet dating. Well, right now, you're not doing any dating. You need to give yourself some options. I know, but there are a lot of freaks on the Internet. Look, I went online this afternoon, found some interesting guys. Come on, Zen. It can't hurt to take a look. Okay, what is this? Oh, look at him. Look, look. Ooh, he is kind of cute. Click his profile. Oh, I already marked his page. I don't know about all this. -Listen. -What? -Hear that? -Hear what? That ticking noise. Who was just talking about their biological clock was ticking? Ticktock, ticktock, tick. Look, I know, but my face is recognizable. Zen, this stuff is totally confidential. You're tripping. Wait a minute. I do hear the ticking. Okay, let's start with him, Zane Thomas. Hmm. Wow, he looks young for his age. Yeah, he does have a baby face, but he's cute. Well, hello, Zane.

I hooked you up with a couple of guys. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I remember, Xavier. -Uh-huh. -He's in a dance troupe now. Okay, well, that didn't work out so well, but what about Alfredo Ascue? You blew him off. -Nice guy, -Wow. professional athlete, tall,single and just... Orange suits with shoes to match, hello? No. You know what? I went to school with that man. Okay, that is a good man. He asked about you the other day, as a matter of fact. Asked you about what? He wanted to know what happened. I didn't know whether I was going to the club with him or going trick-or-treating. That's what happened. That's why you single now because you're too picky, punk. I gotta take a shower. -Candy corn. -You guys. -That was so not comfortable. -He was just playing. -I got to go. -All right, girl. Well, just take my car because I got to take a shower. -Are you sure? -Oh, yeah. She do this every week, man. And if you don't want me, why keep my Xbox? -All right. -All right. Be careful. -Bye. -All I want is my Xbox. -Girl. -What? -The police are here. -[gasps] Oh, move! Let me see, let me see. -Harold's getting arrested. -Let me see. But we'll get to the bottom of it, no problem. See, that's what I'm talking about, see? -Mm. -The whole apartment... -Did he see us?

You making sure they know you for sure now. -And there... -Excuse me, aren't you Zenobia Cartwright from Net Central Sports? -Yes, hi. -Yes, indeed. -How are you? -I'm good, thanks. I didn't realize you were so tall. Yeah, TV subtracts 5 inches and adds 15 pounds. Look like they put it in all the right places to me. What you think? My, oh, my. -Thank you, officer. -Mm. Hey, I like what you did with Nick. That was, that was really, really nice. -Wow. -Well, I'm calm now. -So is she answering? -No, she still ain't answering. Let's try this right here.

Okay, so you want another charge against you? -I don't want another charge. -Okay. -Sir, relax. -Can you please be quiet? -I am gonna be. -Ma'am, we'll come back another time. Thank you so much. Ma'am, no, we won't. -Give us the damn Xbox. Ma'am! -Let's throw him out of here. [casual music] -I'm ready. -Ooh, round two? No. I'm ready to have a baby. Oh, man, come on, not again. -What you mean, "Not again"? -I told you, we're not ready. No, you're not ready. Look, if I get this management position we'll have extra income, and then -You said that... -we can talk about -You said that -having a baby. -two years ago when you found this job. Why are you so obsessed about this? -I'm not obsessed. Okay, obviously I shouldn't have said that. No, you shouldn't have. I'm 37 years old. You're 34. I don't want to wait until it's too late. Women have babies in their 40s all the time. 40s? You think I want to have a baby in my 40s? Babe, we can't rush a baby. We've been married for three years. We have more than enough money in the bank. All I hear is excuses from you. -Austin? -I'm tired. Can we just go to sleep? -[scoffs] -[sighs] Okay. You thought I was ready for round two. You wouldn't say, "Hey, I'm tired". Now we want to talk about something I want to talk about, you tired all of a sudden. Well, one of the things we have in common is that both of our first names begin with Z. -Good point. - Yeah. You know, I got to tell you, I've never done the Internet thing before. This is definitely a first for me. You sure about that? I went on Soul Mates because I just got tired of the process of dating. It's, it's really hard out there. Yeah, it is. My girlfriend talked me into calling. You sure you're not some kind of serial killer? Girl, I haven't been in jail in 10 years. [both laugh] -So what do you do? -Well, I do consulting work. I write songs, and I write poetry professionally. Wow, you write poetry? Yes, and, um, I'm pretty good. Really? Well, let me hear some. Nah. -Come on. -My stuff is a little different. Well, I'm a little different. Okay. "The river runs deep in the land once inhabited by few. The path was there, as I noted the morning dew. Transparency... ...is the order of the days. Wrapped in a blanket is where life lays. There's a light from the sun, the smoke from a gun. It's time to put the package to sleep in the middle of the river where it runs deep." That was nice. A little scary, but nice. I thought you might like it. I'm really not done with it yet. I'm really proud of that piece, but, you know, it's definitely uplifting. Oh, huh. So let's talk about you. Uh, what kind of work do you do? I'm a broadcaster. -Radio? -No, TV. TV? You're not Zenobia Cartwright, are you? -Yes, I am. -[chuckles] How'd you guess? How many people you know named Zenobia? I guess that's true. Well, you know, now at least I don't have to ask what you look like. I guess not. Zenobia, you are very beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Zane. Listen, can we hook up? Let's do lunch. No, no, no, no, no. You are way too fine for lunch. Let's do dinner. Oh, well, dinner is when I get to know you better.

Well, I can't wait. -Will you guys hurry up? -Can you just wait a minute? Hey, what was taking so long is waiting on 13s for women! Stop it. You are heavy-handed. -Where's Phil? -I don't know. -He said he'd be here later. -Um, excuse me, um, these stink. Could I possibly just get another pair? Thank you. Yeah, right. Yeah, right, I'm delivering a message. That's all I am is the messenger. He said he'd be here late. He'll be here. No, no, no, these stink, too. There ain't nothing wrong with these, sweetie. -Did she just call me sweetie? -Yeah, she did. Well, I'm gonna need another pair, sweetie. All right. -Zen, they bowling shoes. -They stink!

Oh, you kick it. What's kick it? Someone I hang out with time to time? Oh, okay, yeah. Hey, I was wondering, I don't know, before you leave, would it be weird if I got you-- -Oh. -Look, babe, -I found your favorite ball. -There it is. -Mm-hmm. -Next in line, please. -Okay, that's us, so... -Oh.

You know, I'm starting to get sick of this. -That would make two of us. -What do you want from me? I am ready to start a family. Oh, come on, Vic. Do you know how it feels, how degrading it is to have to beg someone you committed your whole life to to have a baby? -I'm going to the gym. -That's right. Run like a little boy, like you always do. Oh, okay. So now we back on my age again? Do I always have to get these snarky, little boy comments? When the facts come up, that's what you do. -You run. -Just what are the facts? The fact is, I'm ready to start a family. I want to have a baby. That's what married couples do. They reproduce. I am tired of you I am tired of you putting so much pressure on me. I can't even enjoy having sex with you because I feel like you're trying to set me up. Wait a minute, set you up? Set you up? How do I set up my husband? I am your wife, Austin! How am I setting you up? No, come back out here! Austin, boy, you better come back out here. -We are not finished. -You want to talk about facts? Yeah, I want to talk about the facts. Fact number one, I know your body better than you do. I know what time of the month you're ovulating and that's when you really put pressure on me -to have sex with you. -That is not true. I'm on the pill, and you still pull out. Do you know how humiliating that makes me feel? I am not some jump-off. I'm your wife! Let me finish. Fact number two, I don't always have to work late I just don't want to come home. -Okay, that's enough. -Fact number three, -Austin, stop. Austin. -fact number three, the real reason I don't want to have a baby with you is because... ...I don't know how long I'm gonna be married to you.

Well, you're just kind of a little dressy. This isn't dressy, is it? Uh, well, um, maybe it's the red that's throwing me off. You serious? Nah, girl, I'm just playing.

You told me that you didn't want to have kids with me because you didn't know how long you gonna stay married to me. And I still don't know the answer to that question. God, what have we been doing the last three years of our lives, Austin? Arguing about having a baby. Look, I don't want kids right now, and I don't know when I'm gonna want them. Why didn't you say something before we got married? I did. Baby, you weren't listening. Austin, just come home so we can work this out. I'm not coming home. I mean, I'll be by tomorrow to get the rest of my stuff. Baby, why are you doing this to me? I don't understand, Austin. Why are you doing this to us? -I'm getting off the phone now. -Austin, don't get off. Austin, do not get off this phone. Hello? [somber piano chords] Oh. [cries] Come on. Plow! Woo-loo-loo-loo. Stop playing! Come on. [laughter] Bloop! -You know what, Harold? -Okay. [makes creaking noise] -Really? Seriously? -What? That ain't no diamond. That's a chip of a diamond. Girl, this ain't no chip of a diamond. This is a real diamond. That's a piece of a diamond. That ain't no diamond. -Ah, man, you that ungrateful? -Are you serious? Are you really serious? It's come from Africa. It's a Sierre Leone "salarium." You can't even say what it is. -Check this out. -What? You wanted to get married. We getting married. Then you wanted a ring. You got the ring. What else a man gotta do for you? -You know what? Get your jacket. -Huh? Get your coat. Come on. -Where we going? -We gonna take that ring -back where you got it from. Walmart close at 10:00. Oh, you bought my ring at Walmart? You bought my ring at Walmart?! [tranquil music] Let's just talk about pleasant things. Okay. [clears throat] I got something. You remember when we were kids, we used to give you such a hard time about being so tall? And you could never catch us. I'm glad y'all caught up with me in height, though. Well, not everybody. Y'all just had a crush on me anyway. Uh, ew, no, not us. Phil did. -I did not. Not. -Phil, you did, Phil. I remember a time during prom season. Damn it. I gotta go pee. Why are you always drinking so much water? -Because it's a part of my job. -It's not a job, Cleavon. Oh, it's not a job? Huh? Then what's this? It's a check. From where? From the Reproductive Science Center where I work. It's a sperm bank. Okay. You know, you're gonna get my check wet, man. Yo, stop minimizing what I do, y'all. -Sorry. -I'm serious. Okay. Can I please finish my story? -Yes. -Fine, go ahead. Phil did the sweetest thing. Oh, gosh. Do we... How many times have we heard this story? It was so sweet. Phil could have taken the most popular girl in high school, -You know I could have, too. -[both girls] Cynthia Arseno. But instead, he took Zenobia, and that, to me, was the ultimate gesture of love and friendship. Nobody wanted to take me because I was, I was... So damn tall. -Shut up! -Okay, now, look. -Why? -Now, look. -Why? -I'm just calling it as it was. -All right. -Let's stop. I thought y'all said we was gonna talk about something more pleasant anyway. That's right. We said that. I'll tell you what. Right now, I want to perform a toast. Let's go. Everybody, let's get your glasses. -Toast. -This is serious. -I'll get it. -Okay. -[sighs] -Everybody, -glasses up. You gonna toast with the jug, bruh? To friends for life. -[all] Friends for life. -I thought you had to go pee. I did, but I don't have to go no more. What? Oh, come on. Now come on, y'all. I didn't... Y'all just gonna assume that I did it here? Y'all are something else. -We need to talk. -I'm running late, Coco. I think you need to hear what I have to say. Okay. What's going on, Coco? I'm not happy. [reflective music] Has he been around my kids? No. Who is he? That doesn't matter. You love this person? -Yeah. -Are you in love with him? I'm pretty sure so, yeah. You expect me to just pack my clothes and leave my kids? No. Mnh-mnh. I'm leaving. -You're leaving? -Yeah. I need to know where you're taking my kids. I'm not taking them. I mean, they're gonna stay here with you. You would abandon your kids for a man? Yeah. See, that's what, um, I want to talk to you about because I want to be able to talk to them and see them and, you know, hang out with them from time to time. You know what I'm saying, so. [music continues] That's very considerate of you. Phil, you're the better parent. They should be here with you. Where are you gonna stay? I'm moving in with him. [scoffs] -You're moving in with him. -Yeah. Who is him? Who is he? I mean, is knowing really gonna make that big of a difference to you? Yeah, I need to know who my children are gonna be around. Really? Um. He plays in the NBA. You leaving your family for a professional athlete? Yeah. Is that a problem with you? Who is he? -Nick West. Yeah. -Nick West. He's the biggest whore in the NBA. What? You don't even know anything about him. You would leave your family for him? He loves me. Are you sure about that, Coco? Well, he loves me enough to want me to move in with him. Excuse me. So you just leave your marriage and your kids just like that? What does that say about you? He provides a lifestyle that I deserve. He makes more money waking up in the morning than you do delivering water for a whole year, and what, Phil? How about that? -When are you leaving? -This afternoon. That's not enough time for me to find someone to watch my children. What? My sister can take care of them. Your sister does crack. Remember? Oh, well, your papers are on the dresser. That's the divorce papers, by the way, and Phil, trust, like, I don't want anything from you. No alimony or child support, nothing. Because, see, I have to, like, look out for myself and do what I want for once. [cell phone vibrates] Hello? Oh, hey baby. Uh, yeah, no, no. We're all good. I just had him on my show, and he was flirting with me on camera. Doesn't Coco ever watch TV? And then he was flirting at Vic at Calloway's. Wow. You know what? I'm not gonna say anything, -but I told you so. -Come on. -You know, I really don't need to hear that right now. You don't? Sorry. You know what? I can take the kids every day until 2:00. Okay, well, if you do that, then I'll take them from 2:00 until you get off work. -I don't mind doing that. -You guys would do that for me? -Of course. -Yeah. It's easy for me to do anyway because I work during the day, so... Doing what at the sperm bank? Look, it's not a sperm bank. Okay? It's a reproductive science center, not a sperm bank. -It's my job. -Sperm comes out. -You put it in the bank. -It's my-- I'm not gonna talk to you about this. Listen, guys, I appreciate this. -Oh, it's not a problem. -This is only temporary. until I find somebody. All right? -Oh, yeah. Cool. -Take as long as you need. It's no problem. He knows it's no problem. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -That's your girl. -That's, that's Falinda. Falinda! Falinda! Falinda! Hey. Oh. How do I look real quick? Just look at me. Like a reproductive science center. Okay. Falinda, hey! -Hey! -Oh, my goodness. -Hi. -What? Look at you! -Hi. -Hey. -Hey. -Hey. How you doing? -Good. How are you? -Good. -All right. -Okay. All right We talked enough to them. What are you doing here? I, um, was actually looking for a job. -Oh, okay, a job. -Yeah. How's your, uh, how's your boyfriend? You mean my friend? I thought he was your man. No. He was just a friend. Oh. Okay. Hey, you wanna go out sometime? I don't see why not. Are you serious? -Yeah, of course, I'm serious. -You're not playing, right? -No, I'm not playing. -You're serious? I'm being dead serious. -Okay. All right -Okay. Um, so, uh, well, what are you doing right now? Right now, I'm not doing nothing. I'm talking to you. -Oh. -Just, that's it. Don't you have to go to work? Oh, that's right. You have banker's hours. -Yeah, I work during the day. -[coughs] -I'm sorry. -Yeah. It's not really banker's hours. It's that same language, but just with different words, kind of. -Oh, okay. -Yeah. Well, if you're hungry right now, I... I mean, I could definitely eat. Yeah, no. I could eat . Because I ate earlier, but I didn't finish my food, so I still got room left if you want to eat some other stuff. -Yeah. -I'll eat some of your stuff. -Okay. -You want to eat here? -Yeah. -Okay, so I'll tell you what? Let's go over there. Let's get something to eat. -All right. -The food is really good. Oh, thanks. Yay, I'm excited. ...that I was feeling I've been observing you from afar And seeing your pretty face Lit up my day like a morning star And this ain't even the way to work for me But you're worth the long wait There's so much I want to say, and it can't wait So tell me your name Do you know by now I got a thing for you If you dig it, girl, I'll bet I adore you I've been wondering how I want to show you I'll start with hello, a simple hello Do you know by now I got a thing for you If you didn't know now -It's, um-- -Watch it.

See you guys later. So, uh, how's the job search going? Actually not going so good. I was, um, thinking about moving to Atlanta because it seems like there's better opportunities there. Oh, well, that's definitely not a good idea. And why not? Well, if you move, then that'll ruin my chances of getting to know you a little better. You're really very cute, you know that? Don't do that, just start doing that. Don't give me no compliments and make me blush. I'm dark. I don't want you to see that side of me. Well, since you're being nice, I got a confession to make. I'm just gonna throw it out there. Okay. I'm just gonna say it. -Okay? -Okay. All right. Here it comes. Haven't stopped thinking about you since the first time I saw you. Boom. -[smacks lips] -[chuckles] -Since we're making confessions, -Okay. there's actually something that I want to tell you, too. All right. Go ahead. I'm a little nervous because I don't, I don't know how you're gonna take this, but [sighs] [in deep voice] I used to be a man. [normal voice] I'm just kidding. -I'm just kidding. -Right. -Don't look at me like that. -Right, no. You're playing. -I'm playing. -Right? I'm kidding. I don't know, no. You're funny. That was funny. That was funny. Uh, anyway, what are you doing Friday? I have to go to my girlfriend's bachelorette party. -Oh, man. Okay. -Yeah. But, um, I'd be willing to cancel that for you. You would do that for me? Absolutely. Oh, I got to take a sip of water to that. Mmm. You drink a lot of water. It's just my system. I keep it clean for my job. -Got you. -Yeah. All right. So I essentially located everything here. All right? So, uh, okay, baby wipes. Let me get those for you. Boom, baby wipes. Um, if you need more baby wipes, they're actually in the bathroom, okay? -Okay. -Uh, what else am I forgetting? Let me so. Oh, here. This here is for nose and this here is Vaseline. -It keeps her moisturized, okay? -Vaseline, got it. Mom's work number on the fridge ready for you to call her, okay? -Phil, get out of here. -Yeah. -Relax. I got this. -Oh, okay. I appreciate it. -All right, um. -Okay. Yeah, call me if you need anything. All right? -It's good. -All right. Oh, um, PJ loves those buttery crackers. -They're in the crib. -Go. Okay. -Bye. -All right. That's okay. -Oh. -No! All right.

He's probably gonna call you in five, four, three, two. [cell phone rings] How'd you know that? He's called me every 10 minutes. Bye. Uh, yeah. I just got here. Girl, will you come on? [laughter] Do they want tickets? You know, we can let the kids sit in the box. [Laughter] Where you going, Mommy? Mommy will be back in a few days, okay? Okay. [silent] Come on, PJ. Let's go. Come on, buddy. Come on, baby. You want Nick West's hamstrings to get tight? It's colder than a witch's titty out here. We got a championship to win. Can you say playoff? [laughter] Whoa! What is that? It's a jump shot. Oh, hop in, girl. Mm. Nick West like that dress. [sentimental music] [engine starts] So, you ever been to Vintage before? Nope.

It's going good. I have an interview on Monday in Atlanta. -In Atlanta. -Yeah. -I don't want you to get it. -That's not very nice. Well, I don't want you to leave me. That's the problem. I mean, honestly, I feel like I could take care of you. -I could. -Don't be silly. No, silly would be me letting you out of my life. That would be silly. Just promise me one thing. At least keep looking here. Do that for me. I'll think about it. -Think about it. -Think about it. [laughter] Excuse me for a second. Where are you going? I got something I need to say to somebody. Sit down, bitch. -It's cool. -Excuse me. Boy, Coco, you are a foul, despicable person. You know that? What's your problem, little man? -Shut up, bitch. -[giggles ]That's good.
