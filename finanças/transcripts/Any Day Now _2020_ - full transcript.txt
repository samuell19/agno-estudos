DEDICATED TO MY PARENTS These are mourning bouquets. ANY DAY NOW Bahman... Bahman, honey... Wake up! It's time to get up. Darling... Good morning. - Good morning. Here's some water. -Thanks. - It's a nice, sunny morning. - Is it? - It is. - Not raining? Sweetheart... Donya, darling... Wake up, it's morning. Hi! - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Good morning, big boy... Rise and shine. - Sleep well? - Yes. Can you reach your toothbrush? Have you grown? Wow, you made it! Yesterday you couldn't reach. - Ready? - Yes. One.. two.. three! Lift your head. Good girl! Sorry. Sorry I'm late, Miss! All OK! - Let me... - Thanks. Happy to help. Thanks. If I may... Now we go to Helena and Onni! - Got everything? - Yeah. Have to be careful. Look! Did you get it? Brush a little with the brush. That's right. Excellent! Very good... just a little bit more. So... how's Donya today? Are you going bald? You can't catch me! Bahman! Onni! Come here! Let's have some juice. Will the pier be good? That we shall see. Here... The sauna will soon be hot. Donya! - Want to swim? - No! No! Don't throw her in! Those fish don't want to eat you. - You should have thrown her! - No, the poor wee girl! How did the text go? - Wasn't that fun? - Super fun! Helena and Onni are really nice. I've always said that. Helena and I are good friends. What are you doing? ASYLUM RECEPTION - Want to play? - Not now. I'll remind you about the sound insulation again. These walls amplify the sounds. I've been told that in this building, silence is required from 9pm. 9 o'clock sound reasonable to me.. don't you think? - What do you think? - I'm sorry... Excuse me... Would you like to come... My wife's birthday party... in next month... Think about it... we can be together Have a good night! Like tea? Thanks. I'm completely exhausted. Ramin! - We'll wait till they're gone. - Why? They want me to hang out with them, and I don't want to. Say no, then. You can't say no to Fazel. You can say no to us. Thanks a lot! - Get a load of that! - Good evening! - How are you, Mahtab? - Good. Great. We were going to sit out on the rise. Join us, Bahman. We've been out all day long. Bahman... the lovely evening is young. Come along. I told you I couldn't say no. Bahman... Dinner's ready... and the children should go to bed early. Right? Yes, we always eat together. I have the last word. I think I'll stay. The following are... Number... Six! A sex. If I win, I buy this. - Use your own pencil. - I will. "I shall." Have you noticed your neighbour? - Them? - Yes. Yes. Why? Pretty weird type. Who's not, here? Such a completely listless couple... They're like human wrecks. There are plenty of wrecks here. It's a shame. That such a lively girl... should have such decrepit parents! She's sweet as sugar! Watch out for your blood sugar! My time has passed, for that. "Love, with your pleasure ..." "Seize the young ones, not us..." "With your pleasure you took my youth... " "So seize the young ones, not us..." We mix them up... And draw a number... Fifteen! I got bingo! No, wait... Donya has to dance! - What was that? - It's silence at 9 o'clock. Don't judge if you don't know the whole truth. At the barber's shop they laughed at the bald man... though he just came to ask for water... and wondered why everyone was laughing! - What were you laughing at? - The bald joke. Let's eat first. Listen, look at me. You okay? What's it say? Ramin? We were rejected. What are they saying? What does it say? Read from the beginning. "According to the Migration Agency the proof in the Mehdipour family's application is inadequate." "The criteria for asylum are not met." What does it say at the end? You didn't read the last bit. "An appeal must be addressed to a court." We still have a chance We can appeal the decision to a court. Why so gloomy? We can try again. We still have a chance... and you're looking like it's the end of the world. Tomorrow you can choose new backpacks. - May I stay here? - Why? We should buy the backpacks together. We'll have time for that later. I don't feel like it now. Alright then. - Feeling okay? - Yes. - Be careful. - Alright. - Don't be late - No... see you! - See you at Helena's. - Look after yourself. Hi Onni! Where's Helena? Hi! She's inside. Okay. Thanks! Now we'll have sweet pancakes. We can only have sweets on Saturdays. Nonsense. Nobody need know. I agree. When you've eaten, take a nap. Good on you, Ramin. Run, Ramin! Run! Hide! Hide, hide! That way! Come on, Donya! Are you afraid of a goal kick? Goal kick? No. Should I be? No, not if you you're not afraid of lipstick. Lipstick? I heard that boys get made up, and dress as girls. Oh yeah! You don't have to believe me if you don't want to. They have beauty contests.... with party balloons and everything. The whole school watches. Is that true? Ramin is spotted! - Beauty contest? - That's right. - That's unbelievable. - Yeah. What if we were already dressed up? With dresses and makeup? Then they wouldn't get the credit for it. Right. We'd win. Come on...! we're so good-looking, we'll win in any case. It'd be a pushover. You're not planning to jump from there, are you? Can't we jump from the usual place? Come and look how high it is. We'll go to the usual place. - Go on... jump! - Yes, we shall! How about we jump from here? Let's do it. All the way! Fantastic! Bahman... Bahman, honey... - Good morning. - Hi darling. Can you believe it? What? Ramin will start high school. How time flies! He was such a small baby. Soon it'll be wedding bells. Thanks. Good morning Mr High-school-student. Good morning. I forgot the competition! One, two, three! What are you brushing there for? Go to the washbasin. OK I can do it myself. - I can help you. - Don't need to. - No, Mum! - I'm just helping you. Let me see you. How do you look...? You're absolutely wonderful. Show them. - Be careful. - OK. What are you stopping for? You go on... I'm going with Jigi. OK. Blow me a kiss if you win. Hello. Where are you? I've tried ringing you. Ramin! Aren't I nice? I feel so beautiful. What are you doing? Isn't the beauty contest today? This was the best I could find. Cool! - What? - No lipstick? Of course I have lipstick. I took Mum's make-up bag. Come on. We'll get beaten up. Don't make me nervous. Isn't there a beauty contest after all? - Now I'm really nervous. - There's the bell. Wait, Ramin. Watch out! Come here! Jigi, are you OK? Cool! Good morning 7C. Good morning. Hey, this is it. 7A. Here it is. I'll try to answer your questions. Hello. I'm sorry we're late. Doesn't matter. It's the first day. What are your names? - Ramin. - Amin? Ramin Mehdipour. Jigi. Jirka Virtasalmi. OK. Nice dress, Jigi. Is it for a party or is it your usual outfit? It's for the beauty contest. - Beauty contest? - That's right. A year 7 introduction thing. I don't know what you're talking about. We heard it's a beauty contest, with boys dressed as girls. But I prefer to dress my usual way. Where did you get this from? Anyone else know about it? No. Who told you this? Donya had heard about it. - Who is Donya? - Ramin's sister. - And she's in year 8? - No, in 2. Well... It's a lovely day outside. Leave your stuff here, and we'll go out there instead. - There are places for you... - Not next to each other. One there, and one over there. Donya went too far. She should be blamed for this. For the dress and... We'll tie her up to a tree. She'll manage to get loose. So we'll tie her up tighter. Hey... Ramin, wait. Stay there. Come here everyone... Gather round. See what you're standing on, Ramin? This? Yes, that. - Know what it is? - No. - Anyone recognize it? - No. - Nobody knows what it's called? - No. It's called foxglove. It doesn't look anything special, does it? But the spores in this plant have a special property. They contain a flammable oil that can burn explosively. And this has been used when photographing... to achieve a flashlight effect. Now you'll get the morning's task. Everyone should find something here in the forest... which you'll show when you introduce yourself to the class. You've time to do it up till lunch. Jigi! Can this be my thing? Is it just a stone? So what? Take it... it's good... OK! Be careful. Onward! I think I see a ship! And it's loaded with treasure! You know what? Attack! We'll take the ship! Where have you been? - What happened? - I'm okay. Look at you! - Where were you? - In the forest with Jigi. I didn't notice the time. You're so thoughtless! You disappear on the first day of school! Your teacher was looking for you. Call and say he came home. Why do you go to school? To learn how to behave! And not do stupid things. Look at me! Go and shower now. They say the proof is insufficient. Did you get the new documents? I'll email them. Thanks. I'll attach them to the application. How are things otherwise? - Fine, thanks. - Good. - Thanks for everything, Pouria. - Don't mention it. - Thanks and good night. - Bye. Mummy, will you pray for me too? Of course! And for me! Pray that Ramin will get some sense into his head. Right? Well...? Isn't that right? What are you staring at? What is it, Bahman? I'm enclosing new paperwork with the application. How did the match go? Real Madrid leads 1-0. Or now with 2-0. Real fans can rest easy! 2-0 is pretty bad. Ramin... Can you help me a little? I only got mad at you for your own sake. You're becoming a man. In the future, you obey the teacher. - Sure. - Good boy. And you can make wings out of it, to look like a dragonfly. Ramin. I've used pheasant feathers and grubs and flies as well. - Ramin... - What? Lollo's having a party. Pass it on. - Who is Lollo? - Don't know. Pass it on. - When is it? - Pass it on. Boys! You're eager for your turn, I see.. Thanks, Jigi. Terrific. Your turn, Ramin. I don't have an object. It doesn't matter. The main thing is that you all see and hear each other. Come on. Hi, my name is Ramin. Ramin Mehdipour. And I'm 13 and... I... May I do this when I've found my thing? No, do it now. You can draw or dance, or anything. The object doesn't matter. I'm Ramin Mehdipour and... I'll bring a thing tomorrow. You've completed the task. You're Ramin Mehdipour. - Do we get a grade for this? - No. Good that you are conscientious, but now it's done. Tomorrow we take on new tasks, right? - Can I take the feather home? - Of course. Where do you get all your stories from? I work really well under pressure. And I've learned one thing and another about fishing. Come on, let's go. Why are you going already? I drank enough, and I have Finnish tomorrow. - Seriously! - Nonsense... stop! No, I have to go now. - Good night. And thanks! - Glad you came. Turn it off. How you going? - I'm so sorry, the time... - No, nothing like that. We want to wish you a happy birthday. Thank you! Thank you so much! We've been granted asylum. Really?! Great! Great! Congratulations! We're so happy for you. Come to the party. Come and join us. No, we must go now. We'll wish you all the best and happy birthday. Thank you. Have a good day! So wonderful, Bahman. Good news all round. This has to be.. ...the saddest time of my life. My heart bleeds. You don't like the man. But why the envy? To hell with him! I'm obsessed with that lively girl... who's as sweet as sugar... It's great that they're getting a fresh start. So let's raise our glass... to their very own fresh start! I'll drink to that! Toast with a banana! - A banana? - Do it. OK. Have a banana. Go on, Fazel ... A banana and a smile! Tell me, Bahman... - What is this thing? - A banana. Yes, but... Wait... Look closely now. Pay attention. Nature has made sure... that the banana is ingeniously packaged. It should be opened from the stem. Nature doesn't give a shit how the banana opens! Eat it and stop philosophising! This is nothing to laugh at. Why are you laughing? I'm serious. - What does it matter? - Seriously, Bahman! Nature has packed the banana so... that it has a stem at the bottom. When nature designed... Now you're fighting against nature! - Look now... this way... - Okay. It opens from here, for God's sake. - Look at it now! - A two-headed banana. Look at your banana, Bahman! You can open it anyway you like. Look at it! Wake up, Bahman. The children are going to school. Fazel also needs to go to bed. Well then... orders are orders! Mrs... Mehdipour... A big thank you for everything. - Thanks for the festivities. - Don't mention it. Here are your shoes. - Thank you for coming. - Go home to bed. No more inventions now! We're going to Kabul, my beloved... To see how the flowers are blooming there... Go and lie down. Goodbye. - Come on, Dad. - Let me go and lie down. - Come on. - Ramin, it's time to go now. - Okay. - What is it? Well, what is it? How do you talk to girls? It's a valuable secret... which goes from one generation to another. Now it will move on from father to son. You guessed right. Your father's an expert. - I'm going to be late... - Wait a moment... The secret is... You don't have to talk. You just look her in the eye and smile. Then things just roll on by themselves. - Understand? - Sure. The most important thing is that you trust yourself and your partner. When you do, then you can dance. Choose a partner. Walk confidently to the middle of the hall... and take the starting position. Keep your backs straight. Back straight... horizontal gaze... find your partner. That's it. And one, two, three ... And one, two, three ... Start now. One, two, three... Horizontal gaze... Hold each other. Make contact with your partner. That's it... And spin around, please... That's it... What 2 things are needed for photosynthesis? - Erik. - Water and carbon dioxide. Good. That's right. Go to page10 in the workbook. Pages 10 and 11. I'll be right back. Draw a dead rat! Ahmed, you have to go to asylum reception. Pack your bag, and you'll be taken to your parents. Don't forget your homework... Chapter 3, pages 16 and 19. See you tomorrow. Go away! Shouldn't you have a bit of colouring? Cut it out! Just a little bit... there. Hey, Donya... Donya... No. What's up with him? - No idea. - Hey... ! Shall do something tonight? Go swimming or... You should wear make-up more often. You're so beautiful. - Now you hold it... - Here? And then here. - Careful... careful! - Sorry... sorry! Really carefully. Like that. - And now I take a piece of paper. - Should I hold on? It'll be fine. Wait. Like that... Wait. Wait! - Do you put it on everything? - Yes. And now we tighten it. And now we roll it. Like this. We roll it and tighten it. Okay. Tighten a little more. Hold it, and I'll take... Now we put this in... Just like that. There we are... job well done! Good evening! Ramin... Ramin! - Stop it, Ramin! - Come and help me. Stop it. Stop it, darling. Did you just sleep... Look, Donya... what colours the trees have! - Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? What a beautiful day. What time did I get home? Late... Later than ever. Keep your head straight. Hidy hi, Bahman got a nosebleed! Hidy hi, Bahman got a nosebleed! Hidy hi, Bahman got a nosebleed! Stop it! Ramin! Come on. - You're not Lollo, are you? - Good guess. - Do you know where Lollo is? - Around somewhere. Come in. Tanks. - I should have worn long pants. - I told you. Come and sit down. Are you going to give the chocolates to Lollo? No matter. We can eat them. - Do you want a beer? - Well... OK. - Do you want a chocolate. - Not right now. - You can toss the chocolate box. - Sure. Yippee, a party in the hot tub! What the hell are these kids doing? Throw them out! Have you seen this? So, what? Wait, it happened. - Shall we scram? - Don't worry. Wait for a bit . - How's that possible? - Don't know. The lights always go on again after a while. Try it yourself. Do it! Just a strong kick. - The whole row? - The whole row. Now that you know you can do it, just enjoy it. Share the joy of music. There's no point to dancing without joy. Choose a partner and take your place on the dance floor. There you go... Are you ready? In position, dear friends. That's it. Start position. Eye contact with your partner. Horizontal gaze. Keep it steady. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here you are. I'm brushing too. I'm taking your toothpaste. One, two, three! Look, it's snowing! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
