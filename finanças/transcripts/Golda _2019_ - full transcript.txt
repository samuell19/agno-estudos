We're still rolling.. Look. ﻿I see that the '70s still trouble you. ﻿From 1970, 1969. ﻿It's still very much on your mind. -Look. ﻿If you read.. ﻿No one can hear us so I can say it. ﻿We're off the air look how espicable ﻿Sorry, give me a cigarette. ﻿When you were prime minister, did you have time to read books, ﻿go to theater, ﻿do things besides this job ﻿that is so consuming? -Much less than I wanted to. ﻿There wasn't a month of peace and quiet ﻿on the battlefront or the political front ﻿to enjoy life ﻿as any civilized person deserves, ﻿so... ﻿it's hard. I, in any case, didn't. ﻿Between Golda and myself ﻿there was pure hatred. ﻿In her presence, people felt as if they were children and she was their mother, ﻿their big mother. ﻿Peculiar. ﻿I adore Golda. ﻿Unfortunately, there were those who distorted her image. ﻿I, Golda Meir, ﻿undertake to faithfully fulfill my role as prime minister ﻿and uphold the Knesset's decisions. ﻿You know what? ﻿Since I became prime minister, ﻿never managed to finish a dream. ﻿Because by my bed there was a direct phone line to army headquarters ﻿and the instructions I gave my military secretary were: ﻿Whatever happens at night, no matter what, ﻿if a soldier is killed, this was during the War of Attrition, ﻿it was virtually at the beginning of my term, ﻿I couldn't bear the thought that I'd have a good night's sleep ﻿and wake up in the morning ﻿to discover that something happened. ﻿So he followed my instructions. ﻿I could never finish a dream. ﻿The phone would ring in the middle. ﻿Until they came to me, there was no spokesperson for the PM's office, ﻿she didn't want one. ﻿But she agreed and summoned me, ﻿I asked: What are your instructions? ﻿She said the follow! ﻿In the office you will call me Golda, ﻿when we have guests, either Prime Minister or Mrs. Meir. ﻿I said: Agreed. Any more instructions? She said: Yes. Don't lie. ﻿At the time I was not yet familiar with the others aspects of her personality. ﻿She could be charismatic, full of warmth and love, ﻿but she could also be cold and cruel. ﻿Knesset members, ﻿the actions and statements by Arab leaders ﻿do not forecast a time of serenity. ﻿The War of Attrition was declared by Nasser. ﻿The premise was one: "What was taken by force will be taken back by force." ﻿We grew up with the photos of the dead from the canal. ﻿Eveny day or two, one or two photos of dead men firom the war ﻿and we knew we were going to enlist ﻿into this daily bloodshed. ﻿Our own little Vietnam. ﻿The army demanded an escalation ﻿and she had to approve all the actions. ﻿First she would ask how many casualties were expected. ﻿The debate between our neighbors and ourselves was not territorial, ﻿rather over the fact that we exist. ﻿No matter where we live, they don't want us to exist! ﻿Jews are always afraid. ﻿It's in our genes. ﻿Golda was a Jew. ﻿She had all the Jewish complexes. ﻿Let's start from the beginning. ﻿She was born in the Ukraine, grew up in America, ﻿quarreled with her family and in the end came to Israel. ﻿What childhood memories do you haTve from Russia? ﻿I can't recall anything good or happy? I ﻿remembej the strife at home, ﻿a real... ﻿shortage or food. ﻿And' I remember the fear of pogroms. ﻿It affected her greatly. We are unlike the Rest of the world. ﻿The world is against the Jews ﻿and the Jews must do something to get out of this abnormal situation. ﻿My father decided to go to America ﻿as he could not support his famiiy. ﻿He left the family for 3 years, ﻿she grew up without a father. ﻿In a home full of women ﻿and presumably endless arguments. ﻿At 14 she wanted to go on to high school, ﻿because she had excellent grades. ﻿Her family didn't understand what for. ﻿She should get a job, get married, have children. ﻿We objected to having talks. ﻿Two superpowers are discussing our fate, ﻿our future, our existence? ﻿Bravo! ﻿recognize the tremendous complexity of the problem we will be discussing ﻿and I realize that in talking to you... not just because you are prime minister, ﻿but because you are one of the outstanding women ﻿in the world of political leadership in the world ﻿that in talking to you I will be truly going to the best school today and tomorrow. ﻿Needless to say, I'm deeply moved ﻿by the reception and by the words that you have spoken. ﻿From Jerusalem, the city of prophecy ﻿I bring you the traditional Hebrew greeting, "Shalom." ﻿She was perceived as "one of ours." ﻿She's an American, she grew up here. ﻿She knew hew to talk to the Americans. ﻿She symbolized for them what they did not achieve: ﻿Independence, a woman who held such a position. ﻿It begins from her childhood ﻿when she discovers that there are children ﻿who are too poor to buy school books, ﻿she enlists her friends for a fundraiser ﻿to buy school books for poor children. ﻿A sentimental return to where it all began. ﻿At this school in Milwaukee, in what is now a black neighborhood ﻿and was previously a Jewish district, ﻿young Golda studied. ﻿"Math: A+. "The rest: A. ﻿"Music: B. Comments: Talker." ﻿For them she was the queen of the Jewish people. ﻿And still today. ﻿She was an icon. ﻿Everyone knew that in Israel she was dubbed: ﻿"The only man the cabinet of Ben Gurion. ﻿She hated that. ﻿The fact that she wasn't young and she wasn't pretty, ﻿and always lugged arou that handbag of hers ﻿evoked a certain respect. ﻿Perhaps if she were young and pretty ﻿she would've been taken less seriously. ﻿Perhaps she blurred her sexuality ﻿and opted for the more masculine look ﻿so that she'd be taken seriously. ﻿So even if we called her "the strongest man in the cabinet," ﻿she would've wanted to be seen as a leader, ﻿not seen for her sexuality or femininity, ﻿rather for her dedication. ﻿was a very good trip. ﻿She returned to Israel and declared: We have a friend in the White House. ﻿This was before elections. ﻿was part of the campaig ﻿Ma'am, will you have a problem ﻿distributing the ministerial portfolios within the Labor Party? ﻿am very limited ﻿so I solve problems only when I must solve them. ﻿You ask about the portfolios ﻿as if the parties have no problems ﻿besides the portfolios. ﻿This isn't a bunch of people who care about nothing else ﻿but their seat and portfolio ﻿and whom the people put their trust in. ﻿Strange. ﻿You are distorting the nation's image, ﻿not only that of the politicians. ﻿Wait, can barely answer one question... ﻿What will the next government's guidelines be? ﻿You asked me that and I answered. ﻿Why isn't one answer per question enough? ﻿Mrs. Meir, giving what we heard that the party... ﻿Sometimes I think you don't ask to get an answer, ﻿but rather how can we trick her? ﻿I'm not saying you never succeed, ﻿but not always. ﻿How do you feel compared to 7 months ago? ﻿It's not any easier. ﻿Now I know better how hard it is. I﻿srael's plan is that we won't budge ﻿even one centimeter in any direction. ﻿As long as we don't sit at one table and negotiate ﻿there's nothing to talk about! ﻿I've done a lot of role playing, socio-drama, ﻿group dynamics and that sort of thing, ﻿so I was trying to get her to see, ﻿perhaps... I said, you know, if you could put yourself in Nasser's shoes ﻿perhaps you could see what's bothering him, ﻿and she looked at me as if I was crazy ﻿and she said: Put myself in Nasser's shoes? ﻿I said: You wouldn't have to stay there, ut you'd at least get to know how he feels. ﻿But she's incapable of that. ﻿I'd like to see Nasser gat into my shoes... ﻿If I have to choose a nice image without a life ﻿or a life with an unpleasant image ﻿I choose the latter, not because I like it, ﻿There's no choice. We were raised on stories that Israel was begging for peace. ﻿99% of the youths were highly motivated to enlist, ﻿highly believed that Zionism is a just enterprise, ﻿that the State of Israel is fighting the good fight, ﻿for its life. ﻿Instead of doing what I'd do, ﻿take the first flight to Egypt, ﻿Goldmann sent messenger to Golda to ask for her permission. ﻿Golda said: What?! ﻿And threw him out of her office. ﻿It can't be someone ﻿who doesn't represent what the government wants. ﻿Do you acknowledge the damage to public diplomacy ﻿as a result of the whole affair? ﻿"Damage to public diplomacy?" ﻿First it's about if it's right or not. ﻿The public deemed Golda a naysayer, ﻿unwilling to let Goldmann explore the prospect of peace ﻿in the midst of the War of Attrition that claimed countless lives. ﻿At one point I said to myself: ﻿What do you mean, he can't go? ﻿What do you care if he talks to Nasser? ﻿And the next morning we wrote something along these lines: Up until now we believed that we were going to fight and serve because "we had no choice" that even the slightest prospect for peace ﻿"We are skeptical as to how we can fight an endless war ﻿"while our government is leading a policy ﻿"whereby the prospect of peace is missed." ﻿At no point dfei Weknow if the offer would corne about, ﻿what Goldmann would say, what Nasser would say, ﻿it was totally irrelevant. I﻿srael always has to accept ﻿any offer to talk ﻿instead of fight. ﻿That was the essence of the "High School Seniors' Letter," ﻿I still stand by it today. ﻿Nixon sent her several letters ﻿and the message was clear: ﻿Refuse this proposal and we'll cut off your arms supply. ﻿And the Israeli ﻿thought that it was time to end this. ﻿How do you feel about the US, Mrs. Meir? ﻿Look, ﻿it's a big country, it has everything! ﻿From the loftiest to the lowest. ﻿Everything ﻿I loved New York. ﻿I never lived there for a long time, just 6 months before I came to Israel, ﻿but I loved New York. ﻿But New York is no longer what it used to be. ﻿Why is there no immigration to lsrael? ﻿What do you think the reason is? ﻿That's the tragedy. ﻿What's the reason? -That's the tragedy. ﻿Look, since we're off the air, ﻿perhaps someone can tell me why Jews in Argentina... ﻿Don't come. -Stay there? ﻿I spoke to my friends there and said: ﻿Do you know you're sitting on a volcano? ﻿Yes. So? ﻿So... ﻿It's hard to liquidate.. ﻿Years ago I told the Jews of South Africa, ﻿don't you understand? The clash will come ﻿between blacks and whites, ﻿to the black.s you are white and to the whites you are Jews. ﻿Perhaps something is wrong with our society? ﻿You think my heart doesn't ache ﻿with the people in this country because of what's going on here? ﻿When I know there are mothers saving to their daughters, ﻿soldiers or otherwise: Don't you dare hitchhike! ﻿Did I ever imagine that it would come to this? ﻿Why do you think that is? ﻿I ask you, ﻿how did it come to this? ﻿how did it come to this? ﻿How is it that.. ﻿money has become such an ideal? ﻿I know it's hard to live without money. ﻿I know it firsthand. ﻿But is it an ideal? ﻿With her it was all am ideological determination. ﻿She adopted the Zionist-socialist ideology ﻿when she was in the US. ﻿She was married to Meyerson. ﻿She forced him to immigrate to Israe and took him to Merhavia. ﻿She wanted to remain on the kibbutz. ﻿He refused. ﻿So they compromised, they stayed in Israel, ﻿built left the kibbutz ﻿But I knew her very well when she was older. ﻿Not when she was a young woman and... ﻿She was very affectionate. ﻿People loved to hug her and she loved to hug... ﻿When we established our protest movement ﻿I realized that this woman could change my reality. ﻿We didn't have. electricity or water, ﻿no schools, ﻿no kindergartens, ﻿the conditions were very tough. ﻿I never saw. ﻿let's call them by their name, Ashkenazi European Jews ﻿until the Six-Day War. ﻿after the war these people walked through our neighborhood ﻿as happy as larks, with beautiful kids on their shoulders, ﻿clean and well-kept, ﻿as if we were transparent glass. ﻿They don't stop, they walk through us ﻿to tour the Old City ﻿and you don't exist. ﻿No one asks who you are! ﻿There was this condescension, ﻿it was very severe. I ﻿can't say that I was innocent in that regard. ﻿After the War of Independence we considered ourselves superheroes, ﻿a supreme race, creating a new culture. ﻿And when these people came, ﻿they came to us ﻿and we thought they'd be like us. ﻿They'd want to be like us, because we're so fabulous. We never considered that we brought... ﻿a different tribe with a different culture, different language, different music ﻿and Golda symbolized that approach. ﻿She was THE Ashkenazi. ﻿They claimed, rightly'so, ﻿that the Russian immigrants were getting conditions that they could only dream of. ﻿In terms of housing, employment. ﻿Special treatment. We wrote a letter: "To Mrs. Meir, ﻿"We, the Black Panthers, request a meeting." ﻿I thought that if I could tell our story, ﻿these people would understand where they went wrong. ﻿She, of course, disregarded the letter. ﻿There is poverty in the country ﻿and these Panthers come from... ﻿cramped conditions and big families, ﻿degeneration and poverty... ﻿Their solution i﻿s a more just division of the cake. ﻿You must decide, ﻿Do you want Jewish immigration or not? ﻿That's all. ﻿Do you want Russian immigrants? ﻿You must provide them housing. ﻿Or are you suggesting that for immigrants ﻿we should build huts? ﻿was before Passover ﻿and I said to a friend, let's go to the Western Wall ﻿and declare a hunger strike. ﻿The Black Panthers protested in Jerusalem again. ﻿They gathered by the Western Wall with signs ﻿demanding their conditions be improved. ﻿I thought I was going to meet a woman who would empathize with my narrative, ﻿my story. ﻿The premise was that as the workers' leader ﻿she would understand. ﻿The Panthers arrived ﻿and it was a catastrophe. ﻿When I arrived I was taken aback by the modesty of the office. ﻿She's standing at the door ﻿and she says: Come in. ﻿The five of us sat at the table ﻿while the stenographer was in the third row. ﻿She says: Here. ﻿I take her pack of cigarettes ﻿and hand it to my friends. ﻿I pass the pack aroud and she gives me ﻿this angry look, as if to say, ﻿you're rude. ﻿Her first question: Do you work? ﻿I say: Yes, ﻿I cleaned houses, I still de, ﻿there's no road I didn't pave, ﻿no Job I didn't do. ﻿I sat with a group of them. ﻿Naturally when young men walk in to discuss ﻿a certain subject ﻿first thing I ask, where do you work? ﻿What do you do? ﻿Just to know who these people are. ﻿They were insulted ﻿"You're asking us where we work?!" ﻿And she continues: "Does your father work?" ﻿"Does your mother work?" ﻿You say: There are no jobs, "Then why don't you work?" ﻿"Because there are no jobs." ﻿"Did you go to school as a child?" ﻿No. "Why not?" ﻿"Because there was no school." It ﻿was as if working ﻿is an Ashkenazi invention against the Mizrahi. ﻿Surely the Ashkenazim don't work and demand that they do. ﻿I had documents with statistics ﻿that I compiled with professionals. We didn't come to discuss our personal problems, ﻿we came to discuss the problems ﻿of the Mizrahi Jews in the State of Israel. ﻿She was so annoyed ﻿and she tried to explain who the boss of the meeting was. ﻿She didn't want to meet with them, ﻿then she did so reluctantly ﻿and when she finally meets them, she doesn't do what is necessary ﻿which is to listen. ﻿I don't think she could relate to people less powerful than her. ﻿She saw the people, ﻿she wanted to help them, ﻿but she couldn't get into the details. ﻿She didn't understand the pain, the bitterness, the anger. ﻿And I blame... ourselves ﻿for not preparing her as to who these people are. We assumed she'd understand. ﻿Once again the problem surfaces ﻿that is part of our daily lives... ﻿How can a Jewish hand, ﻿in the State of Israel, in Jerusalem, ﻿throw a Molotov cocktail and set buildings on fire? ﻿Is this how homes will be built? ﻿These are not nice boys. ﻿Yes, she said they're not nice, ﻿because this group... ﻿It wasn't the entire Mizrahi commun ﻿They didn't listen, ﻿they called her foul names, ﻿so she said: They're not nice. ﻿They weren't nice. ﻿This isn't going to air. ﻿We didn't get an answer from you ﻿to what I deem a central issue. ﻿With your criticism of Begin's peace plan, ﻿we didn't get an answer from you ﻿what the peace plan is, not of the Labor Party, ﻿but of Mrs. Golda Meir. ﻿My plan doesn't differ from my party's plan. ﻿Is a territorial compromise the answer for Judea and Samaria? ﻿And the Sinai and the Golan Heights? ﻿Yes. -But no one.. -I don't need... ﻿I don't need an additional Arab population ﻿with the Arab world that surrounds us, ﻿it would be an irredenta like no other in history. ﻿So does it hurt to give up Judea and Samaria? ﻿It hurts. ﻿But I think you support... ﻿Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria even in peace. ﻿So you do feel there must be ﻿some physical connection. -I said... ﻿let's say we give up Hebron, ﻿where does it say that a Jew can't live in a certain place? ﻿Even in Nablus or Jenin if he wants... ﻿But I don't want it to be part of Israel ﻿I don't want them to be Israeli citizens. ﻿I don't want, like in Lebanon, ﻿to wake up in the morning and count: was a Muslim or Christian born last night? ﻿Then they say: Oh, she's against Arabs. ﻿I am not against Arabs. ﻿But people are lying ﻿if they say they don't care if we're a majority or a minority. ﻿How did this woman, who was clueless ﻿in operative matters ﻿make all the determinations ﻿with her common sense, with her faith in the Israeli people ﻿in the State af Jsrael, that's what she lived for, Golda had no other objectives. ﻿For that generation ﻿the Land of Israel and the people of Israel were the essence of existence. ﻿In the territories we are responsible for, ﻿where there is no other government ﻿to which this population can turn, ﻿we are morally and politically committed ﻿to take care of them. ﻿And I say, to take care of them where they live, ﻿because I want a Jewish state, without a doubt. ﻿The hawks in the Labour Party said: Yes, we must divide ﻿because of the demographic issue, but let's take it slow. ﻿They knew from day one that settlements could be a problem, ﻿all the international law experts told them that. ﻿Those territories are not ours. ﻿She never thought of an extended occupation. ﻿No one thought we'd be there for 50 years. ﻿She adopted the saying: "I want the dowry, ﻿"I don't want the bride." ﻿The dowry was the territories, the bride - the Palestinians. ﻿I deny this matter, ﻿this matter of Palestinians. ﻿Anyone in this room who lived here before 1948, ﻿we are all Palestinians. ﻿It's a fact, I have my old passport. ﻿From '21 to '48 was a Palestinian! ﻿And I knew one thing: We are all Palestinians, ﻿some Jews and some Arabs. We weren't Jews, Arabs and Palestinians. ﻿She hated Arabs from the first day she immigrated to Israel. ﻿She was completely estranged to anything Arab. ﻿Not the Arabic language, not the Arab culture, ﻿nothing. As if the Arabs were on the moon. ﻿She wasn't racist ﻿and she didn't hate Arabs, she was short-sighted. ﻿She didn't realize that there were national and political changes. ﻿Hers was a very static world. ﻿When she was young, there was not yet a Palestinian people ﻿which might be true, so it can't be that in the '70s ﻿there's suddenly a Palestinian people. ﻿Her tragedy and ours ﻿was that she became prime minister at the age of 71. ﻿At 71, it's very hard to change. ﻿Mrs. Meir, when you immigrated to Israel ﻿did you imagine that the realization ﻿of your Zionist dream ﻿would face such hostility from the Arabs? To be ﻿honest, no. ﻿And I didn't know much. ﻿I knew there were Arabs here, ﻿but I didn't think about it. -Had you known? Had I known, I would have immigrated. ﻿I'm sorry it led to tragedies for them ﻿and for us. ﻿I'm sorry for that. ﻿My conscience is clear. And for a simple reason, ﻿Every Arab in the world has a choice. ﻿A Jew has no choice. We were faced with many terrorist attacks ﻿and I'm confident they won't happen again. ﻿She was afraid: What will happen if I lose... ﻿She often asked us: ﻿Which one of you will be a man and tell me that I'm no longer functioning? ﻿Sadly I have to inform the Knesset once again ﻿of very grave news. ﻿Arab terrorists infiltrated ﻿the Israeli pavilion in the Olympic village in Munich. ﻿We expect that the authorities of the German Federal Republic ﻿are doing and will do whatever they can ﻿to free the Israeli citizens from the murderers. ﻿The terrorists are now with the Israelis in this area. ﻿I'm told that all the games have been suspended for the time being. ﻿She was furious at the Germans for objecting ﻿to us dispatching a commando unit over there. ﻿Golda called me ﻿and said: Zvika, I want a testimonial ﻿of what happened there. So I said: Golda, I'll go. ﻿I can't forget Munich. ﻿At one point a report came in that all is well. ﻿A toast was even made to that effect... ﻿But all wasn't well. ﻿Golda called me, because the rumor in Israel was that they survived. ﻿I said: Golda, I... ﻿I saw them. ﻿None of them are alive. ﻿"Members of the sports delegation to Munich..." ﻿This came at a very bad time. ﻿The day the athletes were buried, she wasn't there. ﻿Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Yigal Alon. ﻿People started asking, hy isn't the prime minister at the funeral? We had to explain ﻿that she went to the cemetery to accompany her sister ﻿who was buried the same day. ﻿After Munich I couldn't think about anything. ﻿Now we'll.. ﻿have to fight... ﻿wage war against terrorism in Europe? ﻿And GoJda never talked to me about terrorism ever again, ﻿she knew what I was doing, not from me, ﻿but she knew what I was doing. ﻿She only asked me... ﻿that people not involved in terrorism will not be harmed. ﻿"Do as you deem fit." ﻿Golda allowed me to do things thait I will not name here, ﻿even if you wink and smile at me. ﻿These are things I'll take with me to Heaven. ﻿I can't admit we did anything, ﻿that would be criminal. ﻿Ma'am, are you prepared to conduct talks ﻿with an entity that calls itself Palestinian? ﻿You're referring to a Palestinian people that chose its own representation ﻿and. I say, there's no such thing ﻿Arabs will want to talk? ﻿About what? ﻿.Gladly, buit what will we talk about? ﻿Let me put it this way, ﻿if there was a recognized Palestinian representation... ﻿Listen, I want to tell you, ﻿I have so many genuine problems, ﻿that I won't... "Whajt if." ﻿What is your attitude towards the press? ﻿So much has been written about you. ﻿Do you... - Attitude towards the press... ﻿But when you say... -Those fellows are the entire press? ﻿No, but when you say... -I'm not... ﻿I'm not that stupid ﻿that if someone criticizes what I did ﻿or what I didn't do or disagreements, ﻿so be it. ﻿But why do I deserve lies and the distortion of the truth? ﻿At every opportunity, ﻿We didn't only respond to peace initiatives, we initiated as well. We didn't get a chance to discuss more about active initiatives ﻿Yes, yes, yes. -By the government that you headed. ﻿Can you name such initiatives? ﻿Yes, but we're not on air. -But it's interesting. ﻿I'm telling you. ﻿Many initiatives. ﻿Many initiatives. ﻿So they write... and they'll continue to write. ﻿They'll continue. ﻿Instead of saying: We read, we listened, it sounds interesting, ﻿we explicitly said: No matter what, ﻿we won't return to the '67 borders. ﻿So it gave the impression that the Egyptians finally talk about peace ﻿and we refused. ﻿She made no attempt to bring peace. ﻿And honestly it wasn't an easy thing to consider. ﻿Sadat said: I want your guarantee ﻿that you'll retreat to the pre Six Day War borders. ﻿Golda wouldn't accept that. ﻿Surrender land? This was a nation of lions. ﻿what will we surrender? ﻿When there are wars, the initiator and the loser ﻿signs what the victor tells him to. We didn't do that. ﻿We wanted something that made sense - direct negotiations. ﻿And they don't want that. ﻿William Rogers in May 1971, ﻿Ceausescu in May 1972, ﻿nd German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1973 ﻿She suggests several times: ﻿Let's talk, you'll be surprised at what we're prepared to give. ﻿She did suggest a political settlement based on compromises, ﻿she never gave the impression ﻿that it was very important to her. We can easily stay where we are, ﻿it's the best place. ﻿But to assume there won't be a war would be a fatal mistake ﻿and I hope we won't make it. ﻿I want to refer to what is known as "Golda's kitchen." ﻿I'm grateful that you brought up my kitchen. ﻿How did the story about the kitchen begin? ﻿Saturday night, before a government session, ﻿people would come to her home, sit in the kitchen ﻿and she herself would make them tea. ﻿No servants, no champagne, no... ﻿She founds the informal cabinet "The Kitchen Cabinet." ﻿She conducted discreet consultations ﻿on complex matters. ﻿The real discussions take place in this small forum, ﻿the government is often just a rubber stamp. ﻿The Kitchen Cabinet wasn't in the kitchen, ﻿she didn't like the term, ﻿she didn't like the sexism related to the term. ﻿"Golda's Kitchen," ﻿it was an exploitation of the feminine nature ﻿for very non-feminine goal ﻿Golda doesn't see herself as a gender-oriented politician ﻿and she always said: I work for everyone. ﻿She didn't promote wdlTien, re was no female minister in her govern me ﻿that effects the policy... certainly not war or peace. ﻿The first time I sat next to her ﻿was at a big table where Golda sat at the head ﻿surrounded by ten men. ﻿was a hot summer day. ﻿There was a fan that made a terrible noise. ﻿It annoyed Golda. ﻿So she said: Jacob, get up and turn it off. ﻿Ten men got up one after the other... ﻿they turned the button right, left, ﻿nothing worked. She let everyone get up ﻿and once they were done ﻿she got up and pulled out the plug. ﻿That was Golda. ﻿Let's talk about the rumors that preparations are underway ﻿for war in Egypt. ﻿What is your realistic assessment? ﻿Do you think war will break out? ﻿Judging by reason, ﻿by the facts, ﻿obviously he mustn't wage war. ﻿He can gain nothing from war. ﻿But if he says he will wage war, he already said so a few times, ﻿then we mu'st be prepared. ﻿And I'm sure the Army is acting accordingly. ﻿The week before the war was totally surreal. ﻿The elections were scheduled for the end of October. ﻿The Labor party's campaign was: "You never had it so good." ﻿The eve of Rosh Hashana, I entered the canal. ﻿it was a mess. ﻿I find a neglected stronghold. ﻿There's not even a fence to the Egyptian side. ﻿On the other side, Egyptian soldiers are clearing the minefield in my direction. ﻿they're cutting the barbwire fences in my direction ﻿and I pass this on. ﻿The answer I get is: We know, ﻿there's a drill on the other side, so stop bothering us ﻿with the "fine details." ﻿Information starts coming in ﻿that the Russians are evacuating ﻿their advisers' families from Cairo and Damascus. ﻿Golda sensed that something wasn't right ﻿and she asked that the Americans be informed. ﻿The signs are ominous, we won't open fire. ﻿I could sense that she's worried. ﻿She wasn't hysterical, ﻿but she was certainly among those who said: Friends, ﻿this is an alarming situation. ﻿Moshe Dayan said there'd be no war ﻿and I said: There will be a war. ﻿And she believed in Moshe Dayan. Next to God. ﻿The whole world believed in him. We were still under the effect of the Six-Day War. ﻿In any state of war we will defeat them very quickly. ﻿Everyone saw it, ﻿but out of numbness and stupidity and over-confidence ﻿we disregarded it. ﻿Golda never agreed with the assessments ﻿that the Arabs would not wage war. ﻿She repeatedly says: ﻿I know that logic doesn't dictate the state of affairs ﻿and if war breaks out, it has a logic of its own. ﻿At 2:00pm on Friday, I got a call from my unit, ﻿my father drove me at 3:00pm ﻿the eve of Yom Kippur ﻿and I said: Dad, it's Yom Kippur, I'll be back tomorrow night. ﻿Citizens of Israel, ﻿Today, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched an attack on Israel. ﻿Our enemies hoped to surprise the citizens of Israel on Yom Kippur. We were not surprised. ﻿I had to convene the government during Yom Kippur. ﻿The assault began during our meeting. ﻿I have no doubt that no one will panic. ﻿Cut. ﻿It's 2pm, I'm in jeans and an undershirt, ﻿Egyptian planes come down on us and the war begins. ﻿My company commander and 14 soldiers are killed in the APC in front of me. ﻿On the first day I lost three soldiers ﻿and 30 others at the other two, stronghold's. ﻿Of my entire tank unit ﻿50 percent were killed. ﻿One of my best friends ﻿retrieved the body of his son-in-law ﻿from the tank where he was hit. ﻿For me the Yom Kippur war was the biggest crisis. ﻿I stopped being religious, until then I was religious. ﻿The public was stunned. ﻿Where is the great IDF and its capabilities? ﻿The prime minister left fer the front this morning ﻿in white shoes called "Golda shoes" by the people. ﻿Pillars of smoke are visible in the horizon. ﻿Her expression is blank, ﻿keeping secret the thoughts that are going through her mind. ﻿Golda! ﻿Hello to you all.. -Hello. ﻿All the wishes from the heart. ﻿Does someone want to ask a question? ﻿Or give answers, am prepared to get answers. ﻿Is there a chance for a territorial exchange? ﻿Would you consider that? We are. ﻿here, they are there, ﻿they are there, we are here, ﻿everything's all mixed up. so... ﻿That's a luxury. ﻿It's VIP service, it's not fair. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Her image as mother of the nation ﻿who must protect her children ﻿is not a cliche, she really felt that way. ﻿The shift from defeat and surprise- to victory, to crossing the canal ﻿was her doing. ﻿If Dayan had been prime minister ﻿or had he been running things, ﻿it wouldn't have happened. She did it. ﻿She manages affairs quietly, with restraint, strength. ﻿If war was inevitable, thank God she was in charge. ﻿You have to admire Golda. ﻿If ever there was a hero in this war, ﻿besides our soldiers who gave their lives, ﻿it was Golda. ﻿Israel, Egypt and the United States ﻿announced a disengagement was agreed on this evening... ﻿Many people were killed on ﻿both sides. ﻿And just as Golda came to power in one day, ﻿she came crashing down after the war. ﻿Everyone blamed her. ﻿When on Saturday at 4am ﻿the phone rang and I was told that... ﻿there is no doubt it is starting today, ﻿meaning that Saturday, ﻿and I knew that.. ﻿we weren't ready for it to start then, ﻿those were terrible hours. ﻿Some people can easily take themselves out of the equation. ﻿I can't. ﻿And I often said, ﻿I will never be as I was ﻿before the Yom Kippur War. ﻿In what way? ﻿I'm not the same person I was then, ﻿before the war. ﻿If I were 30 or 40 years old, it would be very sad, ﻿but at my age I'll just be a bit different. ﻿I'm discharged after five months. ﻿it was a Friday, ﻿On Sunday morning I stand outside the prime minister's office ﻿and call for Golda's resignation. ﻿At 9:00am, Moti Ashkenazi placed ﻿signs outside the prime minister's office... ﻿One sign said: "Grandma = 3,000 dead grandchildren." ﻿Okay? ﻿It didn't start well. ﻿At first people spat at me, ﻿but I knew that it would eventually bring down the government. ﻿Why don't you tell the people ﻿We made a mistake, we erred, we transgressed? ﻿After all the casualties, ﻿Golda couldn't continue. ﻿A memorial for the soldiers whose burial place is unknown. ﻿It was pouring rain. ﻿Suddenly, voices were heard from the audience: Murderers! ﻿Parents... -Murderer! ﻿Sons, wives, brothers and friends, -Murderer! ﻿For the first time I noticed ﻿that she lowered her gaze. ﻿Golda never lowered her gaze. ﻿She always looked you in the eye. ﻿And it tore her up inside. ﻿The rain is coming down and.. ﻿it was awful. ﻿When she returned to the office, she was gray. ﻿She realized it was over. ﻿She came alone. ﻿She sat down, she was sad and she said: "Friends, ﻿"for five years I have headed this government ﻿"and it hasn't been easy, it took a lot of nerves and strength. ﻿"More strength than I have and I'm at the end of the road." ﻿She got up, ﻿took her bag and left. ﻿No one followed her out. ﻿I think what's horrible ﻿is the way we imitate ﻿in every respect. ﻿So I know I'm ancient and I'm old, ﻿I'm not hip, ﻿but when did young men decide ﻿that looking just like young women ﻿is a nice thing? ﻿Because that is the trend in America? ﻿When did our young women decide that they have to wear maxi skirts? ﻿And then miniskirts? Then super-mini? ﻿Is it because they think they have nice legs? ﻿All of them? ﻿In the times... -So they imitate everything. ﻿The whole world is doing it. ﻿That festival in Paris, ﻿the contest... -Yes, the Eurovision Song Contest. ﻿Whoever saw that... -Did you see it? -Yes. ﻿We won first place... ﻿Yes, good. ﻿So when... -Give me a cigarette. ﻿Would you like one? -No, his are filtered. ﻿I can't smoke your strong cigarettes. ﻿Not only did we imitate the Americans. ﻿Everyone did. -Imitate the Americans? -Yes, everyone. ﻿Still, we had a Yemenite singer... ﻿You can't expect Holland to send... ﻿a Yemenite singer. ﻿You... -But the Dutch, the Scandinavians, ﻿there's folklore and nice things. ﻿Everyone's the same, American. ﻿Were you happy ﻿that we won first place with that song? ﻿Why should I spoil other people's joy? ﻿Golda arrived in Boston when I served there at the time ﻿to treat her eyes, to expand her field of vision. ﻿I said I'd pick her up ﻿from the hotel at 6:30pm ﻿"Why are you so late?" ﻿Mrs. Meir, didn't you hear the news? "No, what are you talking about?" ﻿I said: "Sadat is prepared to go to Israel." ﻿She said everything one can say to a stupid person. ﻿She thought I didn't understand English, ﻿she looked into how long was in the Foreign Ministry, ﻿why is it I haven't learned a thing? ﻿How is it I understand nothing? ﻿How can I believe that nonsense? ﻿Maybe I didn't see right? ﻿Peace to you and God's mercy, ﻿And peace to us all, God willing. We learned from history, Mr. President, ﻿that war is avoidable. ﻿Peace is inevitable. ﻿Mr. President, let us decide one thing, ﻿must go on face-to-face ﻿between us and between you. ﻿So that even an old lady like I am will live to see the day... I﻿'ve always said.. ﻿You always called me an "old lady," Mr. President. ﻿You see, she's not as old as that. ﻿Mr. President, as a grandmother to a grandfather... ﻿may I give you a little present for the new granddaughter. -Thank you. ﻿And thank you for your present that you have given me. ﻿Marvelous, marvelous. ﻿But after all that, ﻿with the prospect of the Nobel Prize for Begin and Sadat, ﻿she says: They deserve the Oscar. ﻿What else can I say? ﻿How stupid is that?! ﻿Peace between Israel and Egypt. ﻿It was the most important political move that happened in Israel ﻿because it changed everything. ﻿And you're saying that Begin and Sadat deserve an Oscar?! ﻿On-her 80th birthday, ﻿Golda Meir is looking tired and pale ﻿as she sits in an armchair in her small living room. ﻿Her family, extremely protective of her, ﻿politely prevent the entry of visitors and journalists ﻿so as not to tire Golda out. ﻿At the age of 80 ﻿she said she'd had enough, ﻿that she lived a full life, ﻿she doesn't want to live forever, but... ﻿it was very sad to see her medical deterioration. ﻿A close friend asked her: Golda, do you dream? ﻿She replied: "I sure do! ﻿"But only a single nightmare. ﻿"All the phones in the house start ringing. ﻿"I know what news they bring ﻿"and I'm afraid to answer. ﻿"I wake up in a cold sweat. ﻿"When will this dream stop bothering me and all those who come after me ﻿"so we can resume the beautiful dreams of our lives?" ﻿"In 20 or 30 years..." ﻿Did I write this? ﻿"There will be no escaping the conclusion that those five years were disastrous." ﻿I'd write the same words today. ﻿The last chapter, the Yom Kippur War, ﻿which remains in people's memory, ﻿is ultimately unjust. ﻿Golda contributed so much to the country in many ways. ﻿In terms of the social aspect. ﻿Her achievements in one field or another ﻿are disproportionate to the price my generation paid, ﻿the generation of the Yom Kippur War. ﻿She was modest, she was decent, ﻿her kitchen was a real kitchen in her modest apartment, ﻿but she wasn't a prime minister. She shouldn't have been given that job. ﻿She wasn't suited for such a huge responsibility. ﻿It was very sad that it ended that way. ﻿This issue with Sadat troubles me to this day. ﻿The possibility of a peace agreement in 1971. We went about it all wrong. ﻿I should've insisted more. ﻿But that's true for most people. We didn't insist. ﻿No one wanted to argue with her. ﻿There are places where we were wrong. ﻿That's on my shoulders until the day I die. ﻿Go through it again? Be heroes? ﻿There is a way to prevent war! ﻿And we must seek it out! ﻿And to prevent war we must make concessions! ﻿The stubbornness, ﻿the rigidity, ﻿the spiritual beliefs, ﻿won't save us! ﻿We wanted the Land of Israe very much ﻿and we fought for it. ﻿Until our last day. Now I won't be enlisted again. ﻿I can't help either, I'm sorry. ﻿The way in which she was ousted from government ﻿was somewhat unjust, ﻿but the end ultimately determines the tone. ﻿Had Golda resigned in ﻿she would've remained a national heroine. ﻿And compared to her successors, ﻿she was a very great woman. ﻿All in all, it's a fascinating but miserable story. ﻿Mrs. Meir, if you could stand ﻿behind the person who will write the chapter in the history book ﻿about your term as prime minister, ﻿what would you suggest the title be? ﻿never thought about that. ﻿I don't know. ﻿In any case. ﻿I hope he'll write about me with mercy.
