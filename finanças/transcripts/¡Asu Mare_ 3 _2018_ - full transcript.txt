The chicken's legs will shake And then, the bucket with blood People will buy it they'd fry the blood and eat it for breakfastw we call it "sangrecita" In Argentina, they call it "morcisha" Oh sorry kid, I squeeze it too hard Take note of our special low prices Lower than Emilia forgiving Cachin Cheated ones, to the cash register number 3 What?
