[WOMAN 1 SHUDDERS, GROANS] [MONITOR BEEPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] I feel like I... I can't breathe. [MAN] Please stay calm. [WOMAN 2] Honey, this is just what labor feels like, okay? [EXHALES] There's something wrong. [WOMAN 2] There's nothing wrong. You're fine. It's all in your head. - [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] - [WOMAN 1 GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [MONITOR FLATLINING] [DEFIBRILLATOR WHIRRING] [MONITOR BEEPING NORMALLY] Where is she? [DOCTOR] You had a complex delivery, Ms. May. You lost a near-fatal amount of blood, and we nearly lost you. I want to see her. Okay. - [GRUNTS] - I'll give you something to relax. Okay? - No, I want to see my baby. - Go to sleep. I want to see my baby. [DOCTOR] Okay. [BABY CRYING] [UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING GROWS LOUDER] [MONITOR BEEPING] [GRUNTS] [NURSE] The bleeding should ease up within two weeks. If it doesn't, give us a call, okay? And make sure that you take these meds only as instructed. Got it? [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [UNSETTLING MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [PANTING] [CRYING] Good Lord! She lives! Mom? I have been ringing and ringing, but you know that. [SCOFFS] What you trying to do? Snatch your body back? And why is the door unlocked? Come here. Come here. Sweaty, but you're okay. What do you mean, he left? [WOMAN 1] Yes, he left. Oh my God. Gemina, why didn't you say something? It's fine. I'm fine. It probably should have happened a long time ago. Probably! But you thought Shawn shit ice cream. [GEMINA] Maybe losing the baby was a blessing. No! No! Don't. That was my grandbaby. - [SIGHS] - That was your baby. And it should never have happened. None of it. That's why I had you guys at home. Just me and my midwife. We pulled you out with our four hands. - Your daddy just stood and watched. - Stood and watched. Yes, he did. And I told you what to do! - Shawn wanted to go to the hospital. - [MOM] Shawn was not having a baby. Shawn's a fucking coward, obviously. [SIGHS] You are my remarkable girl. I'm in awe of you, Gemina. Just answer the damn phone. You're gonna be fine! [NURSE] Make sure that you take these meds only as instructed. Got it? [UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING] [DOCTOR] This is why I stressed the importance of great self-care. Pregnant women have all kinds of symptoms. [GEMINA] You didn't listen to me. [DOCTOR] Preeclampsia can go undetected until it's too late. [GEMINA] Why didn't you listen to me? Ready to go? Mm-hmm. [RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN ON RECORDING] Hey, Gemina, it's James. I'm just calling you back. Again. Um... Yeah, I ran into your mom. Uh... You okay? Just hit me back when you get a chance. Just... Yeah. All right.

I know you have a high-pressure job, travel a lot... [GEMINA] You're still not listening. I told you something wasn't right. [DOCTOR] Now I'm going to ask you to please stay calm. Being disrespectful is not gonna help anything, Gemma. - [GEMINA] It's Gemina! - [GLASS SHATTERS] [MONITOR FLATLINING] [GEMINA] This is why you don't have glass in the shower, Gemina.
