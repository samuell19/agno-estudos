Now, who is going to be telling the story? (Max) Where would you like us to start? (Kathy) Well, let's start way back at the beginning. (Roy) Well, in the beginning, the earth was ruled by enormous reptiles trampling foliage and villagers. (Max) Roy, that's too far back. (Roy) Oh, I'm sorry. (Max) It seemed like it would be just another summer. Little did I know that I would be making major decisions, crucial decisions, decisions that would affect the rest of our lives. Too much cardboard right up front. That's wrong. That's wrong. Alternate. You alternate. Put the suitcase... This goes on top; I know that. Okay. (Man) C'mon, let's get out of here. Watch this. Watch what happens. That's wrong. You've been out here for four hours, Max. There's nothing on the truck. Hey, who's working as a professional mover this summer? You're working as a mover. Thank you. Who knows the difference between a reefer strap and a hump Dolly? Or a hump-- who knows the difference-- uh, a hump strap and a reefer Dolly? I know what they are. Max, it's not supposed to take this long. Dwight, packing a truck, it's a very delicate, it's a very complicated deal. Look, you want to-- you can do it your way: Rush things and get it wrong. Or you can do it my way and get it right. What do you want to do? That's a choice. Heads up, wood man. How're you doing? Why do they call you wood man? I'll tell you one thing. It's not because of the toothpick. I think your tie's a little crooked there. I could use a hand here, Byron. Dwight, you know, I'm thinking about this moving thing. We are thinking so small. We're not thinking big. The entire universe is moving, right? Why do we have to move within that? The universe, Byron? I'll let the universe move your stuff. This whole school year's gone by so fast. I-i-i feel like as though I've missed a great deal of it. That about does it. Let's go. Where's Roy? He said he'd be down in a second. I really enjoyed our little exchange. Here goes.

Then you can do anything-- tells you about golf? Yeah, perfect example. Let's look at golf. What is it? You've got to hit that little ball in that little hole, right? Right. Very freudian. Very freudian. (Dwight) I'm telling you, Byron. Being a caddie is a piece of cake. All you gotta do is pick up the balls and carry the bags. Be nice to the golfers, and they give you big tips. That's good for me. I can deal with people like that. How come your dad's not picking you up this year? Oh, yeah, well, he's working on this big military contract. My father's working on lawn equipment for third-world nations that require armed lawn equipment. I don't know they have that. Well, they do now, thanks to my dad. You get the little ball in the little hole. How many holes? 18 holes? Divide that by two. What do you got? Nine. Nine months... (Max) We were all going our separate ways to our various odd jobs, but still we remain close. So, uh, how's, uh, Sally doing? Good. Do you talk to her a lot? No, probably haven't spoken to her for two-- about, like, two-- two or five months. Oh, that's-- that's love. Yeah, because it's-- you know, it's unspoken. I didn't talk to my father for about three months once, and he took my birth certificate and destroyed it. (Max) That's not very normal. (Roy) Well, then again, neither is my father. (Max) It was the end of another long, hard year of college. (Woody) You think it's easy spending all your parents' money? (Byron) Yeah, but from then on, we were going to be supporting ourselves. (Dwight) Making our own living. (Max) Working toward that American dream with two cars in every garage. (Kathy) Speaking of which, wasn't that the summer of the car theft crisis? (Max) All right, one car in every garage. Roy wasn't sure what he was going to be doing that summer. (Roy) My dad wanted me to do freelance work as a mercenary in south America. [Over bullhorn] Identify yourselves. It's me, dad, your son Roy, you know, serial number one. So will you be kicking some commie ass? You idiot! It's nighttime. I'm going to the market.

A superior mind always wins out over brute strength. Flick! You take another step, and I'll roast you like a pig. I swear to god I will. [Hissing] [Boisterous laughter] Ahh! Hey, man, you're messing with the wrong dude, man. I just--i just escaped from a mental institution. Take one more step, and the brother's a dead man. He's serious, man. Put the bat down. Put the bat down. There are some-- there are killers here. They're after us. And they have bats and car parts. And how--i don't know how many. I--'cause I can only see-- I can see shoes. I can only see-- how many shoes? Hold on. [Whistling] Help me, man. This dude is crazy. Man, I don't know what he's gonna do. Beauregard, do something. Shut up, bitch. About 24 shoes. So figure a dozen guys. Probably just had a rough childhood, that's all, all the other second graders making fun of his beard. It can't be easy going through life with no thumbs. He just has problems with interpersonal relationships. That's all. Just problems. Pop! Why, beauregard, you didn't bring the mint juleps, beauregard. I thought I told you not to meet me here! You know the code. When a mouse pisses on cotton, who can hear it? Who can hear it? You know something, Frankie? There's more to life than this. Hey, why do you think I'm going back and get my master's, woodman? Come on, you? Life ain't shit without a graduate degree. You oughta think about that. [Whistling] [Cackling] Oh. Good connection. This is not the way adults communicate. If my father were alive, he'd string you up, Leroy. Help me, man. Help me, please. Please. Please? Thunk! This is the end. I'd heard so much about it. Quite frankly, I expected more. White light, maybe some dead relatives. Even though you gave me a hard time, I thought there was always a little something between us. Are you nuts? No, not like that. No, no, not a sick thing. [Grunting] That's good. Let that out. You don't want to keep that in. Let that out. Okay, you know, all right. You know, okay, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take this foot, I'm gonna put it on that side of your face. And you want to know something? There is-- not a damn thing that you can do about it. Whooagh! Ow, ow. Okay, there is something you can do about it. [Cracking] That's good. Boof! You need a therapist. [Grunting] I'll tell you something else. Yeah, you kind of remind me of me when I was a kid. Yeah. Hey, I'm going to think about that, Frankie. Take care of yourself, woodman. I think you guys are one man short. Come on, Nicky. I thought we could be friends, Nicky. [Maniacal laughter] Not great friends. Social friends. [Whistling] Don't you ever pull a bat on me, sucker. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Are you okay? What sign are you? Leo? You're quiet. Sagittarius? Ooh, let me see that bat. Can I see it? [Gunshot] I think maybe this time you made a big mistake. Hey, easy, man. You're going to have to die 'cause you know too much. Yeah. Know too much about what, boss? The cars, Nick. They know about the cars. What about the cars, boss? Stolen, you idiot. They're stolen? Blam! Hey, Frankie, did you know these cars were stolen? Geez, Manny, we thought you just liked cars. Blam! Oh, Frankie. Uno che moron. Okay, who's gonna be first? That's nice. Whoo-haw! Woo! Yee-haw! Poof! [Gunshot] Yeee-haaaw! [Cheering] [Shouting] [Police siren blaring] (Man) "Stolen cars found. "Cabrizzi arrested. "Reward to maximum moving: $50,000. Mayor to honor young heroes." Film at 11:00. (Kathy) So you got the reward, lots of free publicity, an invitation to the mayor's house. What was going through your minds during it all? (Max) I remember thinking we really didn't deserve all the fuss, you know? It's not that difficult to outwit a slug like Manny cabrizzi. You're talking about a man with the I.Q. Of a grilled cheese sandwich. (Roy) My mind was on that circular driveway. Who invented that, and what were they thinking? (Kathy) What would you say is the most important thing that you've learned from this whole experience? (Max) Well, you have to remember that the road to success has many obstacles. [Screaming] (Max) Woody, you ran over the dog. (All) Ohhhh! (Max) You know what? Let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe the dog was dead when we pulled in. (Dwight) Wait a minute. Does this mean we don't get the money? Turn around, Woody. Get the check. (Max) No. Don't turn around. Keep going. (Kathy) Well, I guess that's about it. I think it should be a terrific article. (Max) Aren't you going to take any pictures? (Kathy) No, I don't think that's necessary. (Max) Oh. Well, I'll have my secretary show you out. Would you come in and show the lady out, please? [Nicky over intercom] Sure, boys, right away. [Cackling] (Kathy) Is that-- (Max) You know how tough it is to get good help?
