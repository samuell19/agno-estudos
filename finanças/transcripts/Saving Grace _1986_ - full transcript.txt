CARDINAL BELLINI. CARDINAL SANTONI. CARDINAL BELLINI. CARDINAL BELLINI. CARDINAL SANTONI. CARDINAL BELLINI. LEO WILL MAKE A GOOD POPE. HE'LL BE A GOOD CHOICE. YOUR EMINENCES... WE HAVE A NEW POPE. DO YOU, MOST REVEREND LORD CARDINAL, ACCEPT YOUR ELECTION AS SUPREME PONTIFF WHICH HAS BEEN CANONICALLY CARRIED OUT? I ACCEPT IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. [APPLAUSE] [RING] I'M AFRAID THE SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE CRAMPED TODAY, YOUR HOLINESS. YOU SAY THAT TO ME EVERY DAY, FRANCESCO. YOU FIND A DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING IT, BUT BASICALLY, THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME. YOUR HOLINESS, TODAY WE HAVE A MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF THE VATICAN BANK, SEVEN GROUPS FOR BLESSINGS, THREE PRIVATE AUDIENCES, A GENERAL AUDIENCE WITH MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY. A FORMAL AUDIENCE WITH THE AMBASSADOR FROM, UH... BRAZIL. YES, BRAZIL. WE HAVE THE ITALIAN SOCCER TEAM. THEY'RE IN THE FINALS OF THE WORLD CUP AGAINST BRAZIL. IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I BLESS THEM, OR WOULD THAT SET OFF AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT? TALKS IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE BROKEN DOWN AGAIN, AND A MONSOON FLOOD IN THE PHILIPPINES HAS LEFT 20,000 HOMELESS. THE POLISH GOVERNMENT'S DISTRIBUTING TWO OF YOUR SPEECHES FROM AFRICA, RE-EDITED WITH A MARXIST SLANT, OF COURSE. FRENCH COMMUNISTS WANT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FINANCES OF CARDINAL MEDINE. ALSO, TWO MISSIONARIES WERE KILLED IN GUATEMALA. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE DETAILS, BUT APPARENTLY GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE DESTROYED THE VILLAGES THEY WERE WORKING IN. WE ARE PREPARING A STATEMENT AND SETTING UP A FUND FOR THE FAMILIES. I WILL WRITE THE STATEMENT. MYSELF. THE ITALIAN SOCCER TEAM, YOUR HOLINESS. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. THANK YOU. AH. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. HELP HIM. PLEASE HELP MY SON. WHAT'S HIS NAME? PAOLO. HELLO, PAOLO. HOLY FATHER... HMM? THE DOCTORS SAY HE WILL DIE SOON. PAOLO, DO YOU KNOW THAT GOD THINKS ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY? YOU ARE THE POPE. TELL GOD TO SAVE HIM. TELL HIM TO SEND A MIRACLE. WILL HE GET BETTER NOW? DID YOU MAKE A MIRACLE? HE'S GOING TO BE BETTER? I CAN'T MAKE A MIRACLE. I CAN ONLY PRAY FOR ONE. WE'LL BOTH PRAY, HMM? BUT YOU'RE GOD'S CHOSEN. WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE A MIRACLE? YOUR HOLINESS... FRANCESCO, CALL ME SOMETHING OTHER THAN "YOUR HOLINESS." EVERYONE ELSE CALLS YOU "YOUR HOLINESS." THEY DON'T ADDRESS ME 50 TIMES A DAY. VERY WELL, YOUR HOLINESS. THANK YOU. [ALARM] OUR NEW SECURITY SYSTEM. IS HIS HOLINESS CARRYING ANY METAL? AH, YES. THE VATICAN BANK IS ATTRACTING TOO FEW DEPOSITORS. WE FEEL THE SITUATION MIGHT BE IMPROVED BY OFFERING CERTAIN ENTICEMENTS. ENTICEMENTS? LIKE IN AMERICAN BANKS, YOUR HOLINESS. SMALL DEPOSITORS MIGHT GET A CALENDAR WITH YOUR PICTURE. MEDIUM-LEVEL DEPOSITORS, A SPECIAL TOUR OF THE VATICAN. WHAT DO WE GIVE THE HIGH-LEVEL DEPOSITORS? A SAINTHOOD? WELL, UH, SOMEONE... PROPOSED, UH... LOCKS OF YOUR HAIR IN PLASTIC. COULD I HEAR IT AGAIN? YOUR GREATNESS. NO. IT'S TOO... EXALTED. YOUR MERCIFULNESS? NO. THAT'S TOO SENTIMENTAL. YOUR SUPERBNESS? NO. NO, IT'S GOT TO BE MORE HUMBLE. YOUR HUMBLENESS. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. HE'S THE HOLY FATHER. WHAT SHOULD I CALL HIM? YOUR NOTHING-SPECIALNESS? WILL YOU HAVE LUNCH NOW, YOUR MEDIOCRENESS? UH... SORRY TO INTERRUPT. I'VE READ THE LAYWORKERS' PROPOSAL. IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE. LET'S GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT. YES, YES, YOUR, YOUR... DID YOU THINK HE HEARD? NO. UH... "YOUR MEDIOCRENESS" IS TOO LONG. ANY RESPONSE YET FROM VIENNA? BISHOP VON SYLT IS REFUSING TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES SET FOR MASS BY VATICAN II. HE'S CALLING IT A BASTARD RITE, THE WORK OF THE DEVIL. SOME SISTERS IN AMERICA ARE THREATENING TO LEAVE THE CHURCH UNLESS THEY CAN BECOME PRIESTS. AND CARDINAL LE CLAIRE SAYS YOUR COMMENTS ON WORLD HUNGER WERE, QUOTE, "NAIVE AND TOO EX--" [VOICES] ♪ ALLELUIA ♪ ♪ ALLELUIA, ALLELU ♪♪ SISTER. WHY ARE YOU CRYING? SHE CANNOT HEAR YOU, FATHER. SHE CAN'T HEAR AT ALL? NO, YOUR HOLINESS. SHE CAME FROM HER VILLAGE TO SEE YOU, BUT GOT LOST IN THE CROWD. AH, SHE CAN'T FIND HER PARENTS. SHE SAYS SHE HITCHHIKED ALL ALONE. HER NAME IS "ISABELLA". IT'S WRITTEN ON HER MEDALLION. OH, ISABELLA, ISABELLA. TELL HER NOT TO WORRY. THAT... THAT...WE'LL GET HER HOME. DON'T WORRY. HE WILL GET YOU HOME. ISABELLA... WHY, WHY DID YOU COME TO ROME? WHY DID YOU COME TO ROME? SHE SAYS SHE CAME TO ROME TO TELL YOU THAT HER VILLAGE HAS NO PRIEST. YOU HITCHHIKED TO ROME TO TELL ME-- YES. FROM MONTEPETRA. IT SAYS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MEDALLION. MONTEPETRA. ALL RIGHT. ISABELLA, I-- I PROMISE. I WILL FIND A PRIEST FOR MONTEPETRA. DON'T WORRY. HE WILL FIND A PRIEST FOR YOUR VILLAGE. SHE SAYS, "THANK YOU," EMINENCE. ISABELLA... OH... OH, MY CHILD. OH. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. YOUR HOLINESS, WE ARE IN YOUR PRESENCE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR PERSONAL DEVOTION IN BRINGING YOU THE ADMIRATION OF MANY COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. SECRETARY OF THE STATE, CARDINAL MORANTE. YOUR HOLINESS, MAY I PRESENT THE EXCELLENCE AMBASSADOR CARLOS RODRIGUEZ. I BRING GREETINGS FROM MY GOVERNMENT AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOUR PRIESTS CEASE THEIR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES WITHIN MY COUNTRY. OTHERWISE, I CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SAFETY. BUT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. I BELIEVE, ULTIMATELY, WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OTHER. I'LL REMEMBER YOU IN MY PRAYERS. IT'S GETTING CHILLY. IT'S COLD OUT HERE. WELL... IT'S BEEN A HARD YEAR, LEO. BUT YOU SURVIVED IT WELL. STEFANO, DON'T TELL ME I'VE SURVIVED IT WELL. DON'T TELL ME THAT. I'M COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH HOW MOST PEOPLE LIVE. I SOMETIMES WONDER IF ANYTHING I SAY OR DO HAS ANY EFFECT OUTSIDE THESE WALLS. THAT ISN'T FOR YOU TO DECIDE, LEO. YOU ARE LOVED AND RESPECTED BY MILLIONS. YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO. WHEN I WAS A PRIEST, I COULD SEE THE RESULTS OF MY WORK. NOW I'M THE POPE, BUT I'M NO LONGER A PRIEST. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO BE BOTH. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WERE TO RESIGN? [THUNDER] DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM. HE'LL BE FINE. COME AND WATCH THE GAME. ...FOR THE WORLD CUP CHAMPIONSHIP. PEISANO PASSING OFF TO DOBROTTO AS THE OFFENSE SETS PLAY. HERE'S VIZETTI. YEAH, ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! GO! ALL THE WAY, GO! GO! TO THE LEFT. TO THE LEFT. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. GO! GO! WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT MORE RECENT POPES? POPE PAUL X, RULING FROM 1903 TO 1914, WAS THE FIRST OF THE MODERN POPES. A TRUE ASCETIC, HE'S REPUTED TO HAVE WROUGHT SEVERAL MIRACULOUS CURES WITH HIS BLESSINGS. AND, OF THE MORE RECENT POPES, POPE JOHN XXIII IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST POPULAR. WHAT A BUNCH OF NONSENSE. WHAT DO THESE GUYS REALLY DO? THE POPE'S JUST A MASCOT FOR THE CHURCH. THEY MIGHT AS WELL PUT A BUNNY COSTUME ON HIM. LOOK. ISN'T THIS INTERESTING? THE HOLY CITY IS ACTUALLY THE SMALLEST STATE IN THE WORLD. THERE GOES GIVINI ON A BREAKAWAY. COME ON! ...WHO LOOKS INSIDE. A HEADER! HE SCORES! YAY! [HONKS HORN] YOU OLD MAN! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? ...AND IT'S ALMOST OVER. SECONDS REMAIN. THE SUSPENSE... DANIELLO PROTECTS THE BALL. [WHISTLE] AAH! ITALY WINS! WE ARE THE BEST! WE WON! WE WON! ...WINS THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF FOOTBALL! THEY'RE SWARMING... HERE'S ONE! 1... 2... 3! ITALY! ITALY! ITALY! ITALY! ITALY! ITALY! ITALY! I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE-- LIBRARIES, CHAPELS, EVEN THE BATHROOMS. HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. IT'S TERRIBLE. WHAT DO WE TELL THE CURIA? I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN, WE'VE LOST THE POPE? HOW COULD YOU LOSE THE POPE? YOU SAW HIM LAST NIGHT. HE DIDN'T MAKE CONFESSION. HE WAS TROUBLED. AND HE TALKED ABOUT... ABOUT RESIGNING. MADONNA. I DON'T BELIEVE IT! WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF STRUGGLE, NO THREATENING TELEPHONE CALLS. NO DEMANDS FOR RANSOM. HE JUST WALKED OUT. YES, YES, I DO UNDERSTAND. 10,000 LIRE. ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU YOU LOOK LIKE THE POPE? SOMETIMES. UH, I'M SORRY, BUT I-- I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AT THE MOMENT. I CAN GET IT. PEOPLE JUST FEED YOU FOR NOTHING! I CAN COME BACK TOMORROW. LISTEN, BUDDY, PAY UP. MAYBE I COULD WASH THE DISHES. YOU CAN GO TO HELL! COMING IN HERE AND TAKING FOOD FROM THE MOUTHS OF HONEST MEN. VATICAN CITY, GOOD EVENING. JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. [RING] HELLO. YOUR HOLINESS! WHERE ARE YOU? QUICKLY, IT'S HIM. YES. ANYTHING. WHERE'S HE SPEAKING FROM? IS HE ALL RIGHT? WHEN'S HE COMING BACK? QUIET. WRITE IT DOWN. YES. GIANNI'S PIZZERIA. PIZZERIA? YES. GIANNI'S PIZZERIA. YOU SURE IT'S HIM? YES, YOUR HOLINESS. 10,000 LIRE. 10,000. 10,000? DON'T WORRY. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? I DON'T KNOW. BYE, STEFANO. YOUR HOLINESS! YOUR HOLINESS! DID HE SAY WHEN HE'S COMING BACK? NO. THANK YOU. JUST WALKED OUT? HAS HE GONE MAD? PIUS IX WAS COMPLETELY INSANE. HE WAS ILL, NOT INSANE. HE STEPPED ON A CARDINAL'S HEAD AND PULLED HIM BY HIS EARS. GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO CARRY ON AS IF HE WERE HERE. HOW DO WE EXPLAIN HE HAS NO AUDIENCES? THAT HE DOESN'T ADDRESS CROWDS? ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S TIRED FROM HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST. NO VISITORS ALLOWED. THAT'S OK FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD. WHAT ABOUT THE STAFF? ONE OF US WILL HAVE TO STAY IN HIS APARTMENT AND EAT HIS MEALS. THE NUNS CAN BE SWORN TO SECRECY. I'M NEEDED TO HANDLE THE CURIA. AND I THE PRESS. FATHER... I'M A PRIEST... AND I HAVE A CRISIS. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'M... I'M SIMPLY FOLLOWING MY OWN DESIRE WHICH COMES FROM MY OWN WEAKNESS... OR... OR IF I'M BEING COMPELLED BY GOD TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE WANTS ME TO DO. AND, UH, I'M LOOKING FOR SOME GUIDANCE. FOR A SIGN. [SNORING] [SNORING] THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK. SORRY. THIS ROAD IS CLOSED. BUT I HAVE TO GET TO THE VILLAGE. THE VILLAGE IS QUARANTINED. THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC. PEOPLE ARE DYING. [HORN HONKS] NOBODY GOES IN OR OUT. HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? HOW ARE THINGS AT THE MINISTRY?

POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR ME. HUNDREDS. BUT THEY WILL NEVER CATCH GIULIANO. ARE THESE YOUR BOYS? YES. NOT VERY MANY. I HAVE MORE. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. REAL GOLD. YES. WHY DON'T YOU CARE THAT I TOOK IT? ALL RIGHT, THEN. DON'T TAKE IT. MAYBE HE'S A PRIEST. NO. A PRIEST WOULD BE TELLING US WE GO TO HELL FOR THIS. IF I WERE YOU, I'D LEAVE MONTEPETRA. IT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD PLACE FOR STRANGERS. GIULIANO... THE CROSS IS WORTH MONEY. DON'T SQUANDER IT. KEEP IT. ONE DAY YOU MAY NEED IT FOR SOMETHING IMPORTANT. HMM? 2,300. 2,500 NOW. COFFEE. CIOLINO, THAT'S THE GUY WHO SNUCK ON THE FRUIT TRUCK. NEED SOME HELP? YOU KNOW ABOUT DONKEYS? I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THE EPIDEMIC. OH? YES, FROM ONE OF THE DEAD, AS A MATTER OF FACT. THERE WAS A REAL ONE HERE THREE YEARS AGO. THE HEALTH MINISTRY CAME IN AND QUARANTINED THE TOWN, AND THEN THEY BROUGHT IN FOOD. THE MEN LIKED IT SO MUCH, THEY DECIDED TO DO IT AGAIN. HOW DO THEY GET THE MARKS ON THEIR FACES? YOU RUB AN HERB ON YOUR FACE. IT MAKES A NICE WELT. YOU OUGHT TO BE LEAVING THEN. NO. I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY TO FIND SOME WORK IN THE VILLAGE. NO WORK IN MONTEPETRA. THE MEN GO OVER TO RIGIO, THE ONES NOT PRETENDING TO BE SICK. I MIGHT GO WITH THEM IN THE MORNING. YOU WON'T LIKE IT. MAYBE NOT. I'LL HAVE ISABELLA WAKE YOU IN THE MORNING WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO. THANK YOU. GO. GO. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO. HELLO, STEFANO. YOUR HOLINESS! WHERE ARE YOU? I'M IN A SMALL VILLAGE IN THE SOUTH. HE'S IN THE SOUTH. WHEREABOUTS? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I'M FINE. I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED FROM WORKING. WORK? YOU GOT A JOB? WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY A JOB. I SORT RAGS WITH THE VILLAGERS. HE'S SORTING RAGS. RAGS? YOUR HOLINESS, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, CAN'T THESE PEOPLE SORT THEIR OWN RAGS? WELL, YES, THEY COULD, BUT, UH... WE CAN EASILY SEND YOU MONEY IF-- NO, NO, STEFANO. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. REALLY. ASK HIM WHEN HE'S COMING BACK. YOUR HOLINESS, WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? NO. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M COMING BACK. I THINK I'M SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING HERE. BUT WE'VE ANNOUNCED THAT YOU ARE ON A TWO-WEEK RETREAT. WHAT CAN WE DO IF YOU'RE NOT BACK IN TIME? YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. I HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOU. YES, YOUR HOLINESS. BYE-BYE, STEFANO. GOOD-BYE, YOUR HOLINESS. HE HAS COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN US. THAT DOESN'T HELP, DOES IT? JUST PRAY. WELL... HERE I AM IN MONTEPETRA. I CAN SEE WHY YOU WANTED SOMEBODY TO COME. I FEEL RATHER INADEQUATE, TO TELL THE TRUTH, BECAUSE THERE IS RATHER A LOT TO DO. I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO BEGIN. IN FACT... I THINK REALLY I COULD DO WITH SOME HELP. [SHEEP BLEATING] GOOD MORNING. HELLO. IT'S A WONDERFUL VIEW. YOU'RE POPE LEO, HUH? YOU'RE POPE LEO, YES. [SHEEP BLEATING] EXCUSE THE SHEEP. THEY SEE SO FEW POPES. THEY FIRED YOU OR WHAT? I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. NO. THEY DIDN'T FIRE ME. MAYBE GOD DID. I CAN PUT YOUR MIND TO REST WITH THAT. THERE'S NO SUCH PERSON. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AQUEDUCT? EARTHQUAKE. HALF THE VILLAGE WENT WITH IT. WHY WAS IT NEVER REBUILT? FOR THAT YOU NEED THE MONEY... AND THE WILL. THE MONEY WAS TAKEN BY THE PRIESTS. AND THE WILL BY... BY WHO? DARWIN. HEY! OUCH! I COULD DO WITH YOUR HELP. WHY SHOULD I BREAK MY BACK FOR NOTHING WHEN I CAN TAKE IT EASY AND STILL GET NOTHING? WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WILL COME TO NOTHING? DON'T JUST LAUGH. GIVE ME AN ANSWER. MMM...WELL... I DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN YOUR GRAND DESIGNS. WHERE EXACTLY DO YOUR INTERESTS LIE? YOUR PROFESSION DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND. MY PROFESSION? MM-HMM. WHAT IS MY PROFESSION? TELL ME. WHAT PROFESSION? YOU'RE THE POPE. YES. AND YOU HAVE EXACTLY YOUR IDEA OF WHAT THE POPE IS, BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REALIZE A POPE CAN BE ANYTHING, EVEN A TRAMP WHO COMES TO A DESERTED VILLAGE TO HELP NEGLECTED PEOPLE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECT THE POPE TO BE. IN WHATEVER WAY, THE PRACTICE IS THE SAME-- HMM? TO INTERFERE AND TO RULE. MAY I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? COULD I JUST TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? I WAS, UM... LOOKING AT THE AQUEDUCT. I THINK IT COULD BE REBUILT. YOU COULD GET SOME WATER BACK INTO THE HILLS. BETTER THAN TO GO INTO RIGIO TO WORK IN THE DUMP. YES, BUT HOW? THERE'S A LOT OF TIMBER DOWN THERE JUST LYING AROUND. THE TROUGH IS BROKEN. THERE'S ENOUGH WOOD IN THE VILLAGE TO REPAIR THE TROUGH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WE CAN FIND A WAY TO TURN THE WHEEL. VERY GOOD IDEA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD IDEA. HEY, GET ME OUT OF HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE NET? COME ON. GET OUT. UH-OH. WE BETTER GO. I ALREADY SOLD YOUR STINKING CROSS. IT WASN'T EVEN REAL GOLD. YOU WERE TAKEN FOR A RIDE. I DIDN'T COME ABOUT THE CROSS. YOU DO ANYTHING TO ME, MY MEN WILL KILL YOU LIKE A DOG. IT'S A TERRIFYING PROSPECT. NOT THOSE GUYS. THEY'RE WORTHLESS. SOME OTHER GUYS. YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS. I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. IF YOU CALL OFF THE OTHER GUYS, I'LL LET YOU WORK WITH ME FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK. WHAT KIND OF A DEAL IS THAT? IT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL. FOR YOU, I ADMIT, IT'S NOT GOOD. LOOK, YOU HAVE ALL THESE GUYS. I HAVE NOBODY AT ALL. SO I THOUGHT PROBABLY YOU WOULDN'T MIND GIVING ME A HAND. AND THAT THING YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD? DO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE VILLAGE IS LAUGHING AT YOU. IT'S GOING TO BE AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM. YOU GET TO MIX CEMENT, YOU COULD DO SOME DIGGING-- I DON'T DO THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT I WOULD TEACH YOU. I THINK YOU COULD BE GOOD AT IT. YOU CAN EXECUTE ME RIGHT HERE! I'M NOT GONNA DO NO DIGGING! BUT, GIULIANO, YOU OWE ME A FAVOR. WHAT FAVOR? I DIDN'T TURN YOU IN FOR TAKING THE CROSS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SHOW UP? I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. I DIDN'T GIVE YOU MY WORD. I'LL TAKE IT ANYWAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. YOU CAN KEEP THE CROSS, GIULIANO. I GIVE IT TO YOU WITH PLEASURE. BRING THE PULLEYS. GET ME OUT OF HERE! AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE, SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO THE POPE'S WIDELY ANTICIPATED EASTER ADDRESS, RUMORS CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE IN ROME CONCERNING THE CONDITION OF POPE LEO XIV. ALTHOUGH THE VATICAN INSISTS HE IS SUFFERING ONLY A MINOR INDISPOSITION, THE POPE'S FAILURE TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC FOR FIVE DAYS HAS GIVEN RISE TO SPECULATION THAT HE IS SERIOUSLY ILL. PRESSURE IS MOUNTING FOR MORE COMPLETE DISCLOSURE BY THE VATICAN MEDICAL STAFF. AH, YOU BROUGHT THE STUFF. WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. WHERE'S GIULIANO? HE SENT US. HE SAID TWO WERE BETTER THAN ONE. THAT WASN'T THE AGREEMENT. OK, I'LL GO TELL HIM. AFTER YOU WORK, HUH? HEY, THIS MEAN TROUBLE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I NEED TO CLEAN. DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE? THAT'S ALRIGHT. MAY I COME IN? OH, YES. THANK YOU. I CAN'T DO IT. YES, YOU CAN. THAT BALD GUY THERE. GO ON. I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL. I TOLD YOUR MOTHER YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. NO. DON'T MAKE ME GET MAD. I'LL TAKE THAT. COME HERE.

LEAVE HIM ALONE! THERE WAS NO MONEY! DON'T LIE! DON'T LIE! THERE'S NO MONEY! STOP HITTING ME! WHERE'S THE MONEY? LEAVE HIM ALONE! LEAVE HIM ALONE! WHERE'S THE WALLET? THERE WAS NO MONEY. AH! YOU'VE CAUSED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. NO, PLEASE! LEAVE HIM ALONE! STOP IT! GET UP! GET UP! NO! NO! PLEASE, DON'T! NO MORE! GET OUT. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I THINK SO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HOW CAN I POSSIBLY BE ALL RIGHT? HE PUNCHED ME FIVE TIMES, HE KICKED ME SOME TIMES. I'M NOT JOKING. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? LET ME SEE. WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY, UH... WHY DO YOU STAY IN MONTEPETRA? THIS IS MY HOME. DID YOU EVER LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE? YES. WHERE? NAPLES. I WENT THERE AFTER VITTORIO DIED. ISABELLA WAS 3, AND I WAS ALONE. I SAW A NOTICE ABOUT JOBS FOR GIRLS. THIS WAS A CHANCE TO CHANGE MY LIFE, SO I WENT THERE, BUT THERE WERE NO JOBS. HUNDREDS OF GIRLS, BUT NO JOBS. THEY DO THAT TO KEEP THE WAGES DOWN. I SEE. I'M SORRY TO BE BORING YOU WITH THIS. NO, YOU'RE NOT BORING ME. WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING. I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T PRY. NO, I MEAN, I JUST... I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED? WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY TO EAT OR COME HOME. DID YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE TO LIVE? I FOUND A PLACE, YES. THERE WAS THIS MAN WHO SAID HE HAD A PLACE, BUT... OW! SORRY. WHAT? WELL... THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE. THE AQUEDUCT'S BURNING! OH, LOOK. OH, MY GOD. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? STAY BACK. STAY BACK. CAN WE STOP IT? WHAT HAPPENED? SOME MEN FROM CIOLINO. DID YOU SEE THEM? YES. YOU TRIED TO STOP THEM? WHAT COULD I DO? BESIDES, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR BUSINESS IF YOUR HOUSE BURNS DOWN! WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS? THIS IS CIOLINO'S VILLAGE. HE DOESN'T WANT YOU HERE. I'LL BUILD IT AGAIN. THEY'LL BURN IT AGAIN. I'LL BUILD IT AGAIN. WHEN THEY COME BACK, I'LL BE HERE. I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU. AH, LUCIA. I JUST WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO YOU. OH, LUCIA. LUCIA. I... I WANT-- NO. NO. NO. I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT I WANT YOU HERE WITH ME. THEN I'LL BE HERE WITH YOU. I WANTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU. BUT FOR A REASON... THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND LATER, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. DON'T. IT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I WANT YOU TO BE HERE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY AWKWARD ANYWAY. MMM, LUCIA. DON'T BE SORRY. I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT NOW. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. MAY GOD BLESS YOU, LUCIA. I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE YOU COULD USE SOME SUPPLIES IF YOU'RE STAYING DOWN AT THE AQUEDUCT. OH. SO I PUT THEM ON TO PREPARE. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF. I'LL HELP YOU, UNLESS IT WOULD EMBARRASS YOU. WHY SHOULD I FEEL EMBARRASSED? MEN HERE DON'T LIKE TO WORK WITH WOMEN. OH. NO, WELL, FOR ME, IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE. GOOD. GOOD MORNING. WE COME TO WORK WITH YOU. THEY KNOW ALREADY. HEY! TONINO, LOOK WHO'S COMING. HOW YOU DOING? HELLO. I WANT YOU TO MEET BIANCA. HOW DO YOU DO, BIANCA? HELLO. SO, GIULIANO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN GETTING BOYS. IT'S PITIFUL FOR A MAN WORKING WITH LITTLE GIRLS. YOU WANT EVERYBODY LAUGHING? THEY'RE ALREADY LAUGHING. YOU HAD ENOUGH LAUGHING. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHERE DID YOU GET THESE BOYS? I GOT FRANCO HIS FIRST WOMAN, I GOT FABIO OUT OF TROUBLE, AND I BEAT UP A GUY FOR STEFAN. I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW ARE THESE GUYS DOING? THEY'RE FINE. THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD. ANY TROUBLE, YOU LET ME KNOW. THANK YOU, GIULIANO, FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING. THAT'S OK. HOLD THIS FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE. OH, SURE, YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE? WE HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT. OK. VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, GIULIANO, NOW, SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING? WE'RE PUTTING UP THESE POSTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT THIS. [RING] [RING] HELLO. HELLO, STEFANO. YOUR HOLINESS. YOUR HOLINESS, ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY BACK? NO, NO, NOT YET. CALLED TO TELL YOU THAT I COULD BE HERE FOR SOME TIME. LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS? STEFANO, LISTEN CAREFULLY. I'M HELPING THE VILLAGE TO REBUILD THE IRRIGATION SYSTEM. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT? NO, STEFAN, I DON'T, BUT I'M LEARNING. WE CAN SEND EVERYTHING THEY NEED. ENGINEERS, MATERIALS, WE CAN BUILD IT FOR THEM. THESE ARE DEFEATED PEOPLE. IT WOULD SOON FALL INTO DISUSE. THEY HAVE TO DO IT THEMSELVES. BUT THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS. WELL, ANYWAY, STEFANO, IT MAY BE SOME TIME YET. HOLINESS, THE CARDINALS ARE RESTLESS, AND THE PRESS IS TRYING TO BRIBE THE STAFF FOR INFORMATION. STEFANO, I WILL BE BACK...SOMETIME. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE, HOLINESS. SO WHY DO YOU WORK FOR THIS GUY? I LOST A BET WITH HIM. HE'S NOT EVEN FROM HERE. WHY BE HONEST WITH HIM? I'M AN HONORABLE MAN. DON'T GET WISE WITH ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT. YOU WERE NOTHING WHEN I FOUND YOU. YOU GO ON WORKING FOR HIM, I'M GOING TO CUT YOU OFF. YOU UNDERSTAND? NO MORE PRETTY GIRLS OR FANCY SUITS. WORK FOR SLAVE LABOR. SEE WHAT YOU GET. AT LEAST I WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO STARVE TO DEATH, YOU BASTARD. WHO'S THERE? IS THE BOMBARDMENT OVER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I JUST CAME TO SAY HELLO. SO... HELLO. COME IN. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. [COUGHS] [COUGHS] WHERE DID YOU GET THE FIREWORKS? I BOUGHT THEM. DID I SAY YOU DIDN'T? I HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS. MANDARIN DUCKS, BANTAM PHANTOMS. BANTAM PHANTOMS. YEAH. COME FESTIVAL TIME, I SELL THEM TO ALL THE TOWNS. BUT THAT'S NOTHING. HOW'S THIS? WONDERFUL. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MONTEPETRA WITH A TV. AH, YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY HERE. NOPE. IT MUST BE RATHER DIFFICULT TO WATCH. YEAH, SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES. IT'S A CONFESSIONAL FROM THE CHURCH? YEAH. WHO IS THE MAN IN THE PICTURE? SOMEBODY. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER? SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T EVER KNOW MY MOTHER AND FATHER. I WAS BROUGHT UP IN AN ORPHANAGE, YOU KNOW. THE NUNS FOUND ME AND TOOK ME IN. THEY SAID THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY EVER MADE WAS TO TAKE ME IN. I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE PLACES, TOO. MY FATHER COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF ME. HE WAS ALWAYS TRAVELING. SO HE DROPPED ME OFF THERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MOTHER? SHE DIED WHEN I WAS BORN. AH. SOME OF US, YOU KNOW, ARE SLEEPING OUT BY THE WATER WHEEL, AND WE COULD DO WITH SOME NEW CONVERSATION OUT THERE. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND STAY THERE FOR A FEW NIGHTS? YEAH, MAYBE. WHATEVER YOU THINK. SEE HOW WELL YOUR BOYS ARE DOING? WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING, THEY DO IT GOOD. LET ME PAST. LOOK. LOOK, LOOK.

DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? YEAH. BRING IT DOWN. CIOLINO. CIOLINO. SHUT UP, STUPID. YOU'LL WAKE THEM. THEY'RE HERE! THEY TRIPPED THE WIRE! EVERYBODY UP. COME ON. AH HA! GET OUT! I REPEAT, HIS CONDITION IS NOT SERIOUS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CAUSE FOR ALARM. I'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE HIS HOLINESS' ANNOUNCEMENTS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE'S RECOVERED FROM HIS INFLUENZA. THANK YOU. WHEN WILL THAT BE? I CAN'T SAY. FIRST HE WAS INDISPOSED, THEN HE HAD A COLD. NOW IT'S INFLUENZA. AS I SAID, HIS HOLINESS IS RESTRICTED TO BED. THANK YOU. IS IT TRUE THAT HEART SPECIALISTS ARE BEING FLOWN IN? HEY, EVERYBODY! THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK! THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK! NO MORE FREE FOOD! IT'S OVER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK. SOMEBODY TALKED. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU STAY OUT OF THIS. YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH PROBLEMS ALREADY. ALL OF YOU, GET DOWN! WHY SHOULD THEY GET DOWN? BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BURN IT. NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BURN SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE OF BENEFIT TO THESE PEOPLE, AND HAVE THEM GO BACK TO A GARBAGE DUMP. TELL THE WOMEN TO GET DOWN. COME ON, GET DOWN! [YELLING IN ITALIAN] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COME DOWN. ARE YOU GOING TO STOP US? YES. YAY! GET BACK! COME ON! BACK! YAY! YAY! HEY! DON'T! GIULIANO! NO, DON'T DO IT! COME BACK HERE! AAH! GIULIANO! OH, MY GOD! GET HELP! I KNOW... I KNOW THAT I SHOULD PRAY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT I NEVER HAD TO FACE BEFORE THE DEATH OF SOMEONE THAT I LOVED. IT IS VERY HARD. IT'S VERY HARD. WHAT ABOUT STEFAN VII? HE ORDERED THE BODY OF HIS PREDECESSOR FORMOSUS TO BE EXHUMED, CLAD IN PAPAL ROBES, AND PUT ON TRIAL. THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY. IN HISTORY, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO GOT THERE FIRST. WHATEVER ONE DOES, IT'S SELDOM THE WORST OF ITS KIND. THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS, COMPARED WITH THESE OTHER PEOPLE, OUR POPE LEO IS A VERY SANE MAN. I THINK HE'LL COME BACK. PERHAPS, BUT I HAVE THINGS TO DO. SEE YOU LATER, COLIN. GHEZZI. HUH? YOU FORGOT TO KNEEL. [KNOCK ON DOOR] SECRETARY OF STATE CARDINAL MORANTE. PLEASE OPEN. REST WELL, HOLINESS. I'LL SEE TO IT YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED. WE MUST SEE HIS HOLINESS. HE CANNOT BE DISTURBED. THIS THING CANNOT WAIT. BUT HE'S JUST FALLEN ASLEEP. WELL, WHEN HE WAKE UP, CALL US. WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE? IT COULD BE QUITE A WHILE. HELLO. WONDERFUL VIEW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? EXAMINING YOUR TERRIBLE WORKMANSHIP. I MISSED YOU. HA! YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU BUILD THIS WATER TRESTLE AND WONDERING IF YOU EVER CONSIDERED HOW YOU WERE GOING TO TURN THE WATER WHEEL? YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE. I HAVE CONSIDERED THAT, YES. BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE FAITH SOMETHING WILL TURN UP. LEONARDO DA VINCI WAS CONDEMNED BY THE CHURCH, WASN'T HE? YES. HMM. WELL, HE'S THE ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR WATER WHEEL. OH, I THREW AWAY MY SPECS. AH! IT'S WONDERFUL. UH-HUH. IT'S WONDERFUL. WHO ARE YOU, ABALARDI? I WAS FIRED. FROM THE CHURCH? BY GOD. YOU'RE A PRIEST. YES. WERE YOU FIRED, OR DID YOU RESIGN? WHY? I FELT BETRAYED BY GOD. AND I SAW YOU APPROACH THE SAME HELL, BUT YOU DIDN'T FALL IN. OF COURSE, YOU ARE THE POPE. FOR POPES, THE FLAMES ARE HOTTER. THANK YOU. ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE YOU CAME TO SEE ME. I LOVE YOU. THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED. THERE'S STILL A LOT TO DO. HMM? MM-HMM. YOU'LL DO IT. HUH? YES. YEAH. [BELLS RINGING] ♪ OH OH OH OH OH OH ♪ ♪ OH OH OH OH OH ♪ ♪ OH OH OH OH OH ♪ ♪ ALLELUIA ♪ ♪ ALLELUIA ♪ ♪ ALLELUIA, ALLELU... ♪♪ WE'VE HAD QUITE ENOUGH, MONSIGNOR GHEZZI. WE DEMAND TO SEE HIS HOLINESS, IF HE'S IN HERE. YES, BUT WAIT. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE IN THERE. AS THE SENIOR MEMBER OF THE STAFF, I ORDER YOU TO STAND ASIDE. CARDINAL MORANTE, HOW ARE YOU? I'M SORRY, YOUR HOLINESS. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE. WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE? HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU, I AM MUCH BETTER. VERY SORRY. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE OR... NO, NO, THANK YOU. BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN. THANK YOU. VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! CHILDREN OF GOD, I WELCOME YOU HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EASTER SUNDAY. I'M MORE HAPPY THAN I CAN EXPRESS THAT I CAN SPEND IT WITH YOU. I MUST THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT DURING MY ILLNESS, BUT WE ARE NONE OF US SUPPOSED TO TELL LIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO WEAR THIS HAT. SO I MUST ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS AND TELL YOU THAT I WAS NOT CONFINED TO BED WITH INFLUENZA AS WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED. INSTEAD, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE. I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD STORY. THERE WAS ONCE A MAN KNOWN TO YOU AS POPE LEO XIV. LIKE A KING WHO LIVED IN A LARGE CASTLE WITH THICK WALLS, HE BECAME INCREASINGLY DEPRESSED AND ALONE, UNABLE TO SEE OR KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE.
