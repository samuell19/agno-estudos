- Natural Burials - Born by nature and returning to nature. It's a funeral method of burying one's ashes by the roots of the tree, that makes one become one with the tree. It's time to say our last farewell to Don Bosco. We find solace in knowing that we will meet him again ...through Christ and share our happiness with each other. We are gathered here today to say our last goodbye, to show our love, share our sorrows and give each other hope. Let us pray for the deceased. Lord our Father, we leave Don Bosco to you. Forgive all sins he committed as a feeble human through your mercy. We pray that he has eternal happiness with you in heaven with all the saints. - We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Amen No! No! My son! Not my son! Natural burial is when the body is cremated and buried at the roots of the tree. From nature and returning to nature it's where the human soul is kept. The warmth deep inside the ashes of the dead is transferred into the trees. The warm blood turns to iron for the tree. The plump flesh turns into the tree's leaves and branches. The soul becomes the tree itself. The dead have memories full of resent and can't spread its roots deep into the earth. They return as resentment. Natural Burials No need to count it's all there. See you next time. Take care. Chang Heom Cemetery Trees You crazy.. Shut up! Shut the fuck up and go to sleep! Shut up and go to sleep! You guys fucking with me right now?! How did I not once... think of going to you. If you can't come here... I'll go to you. Let's see, did you all sleep well? You scared me. Your medicine? Not yet, I'm going to get ready for work first. You're not normal right now. Take care of yourself no matter how busy you are. Okay. Here. - I'll take it later. - Take it in front of me. I'm going. Excuse me. Can I help you? You dropped this. Thank you. It's nothing. Cheong-Ah! Hello director! It's been awhile. It's really hot right? Let's go upstairs. You plan on working forever? No marriage plans? I know right? He's not proposing. You have a boyfriend? I knew you would. I don't know who he is but he's a bad guy. Been together for long? Yes. Since high school. Really? Then he's a real bad guy. Right? I didn't know you liked bad boys Cheong-Ah. Thank you. Take a look at this. It's pretty awful this time. It didn't look contagious so we kept a close eye on it for now. But something doesn't seem right. Can you take a look at it Cheong Ah? I would like to see these trees myself. Where can I see them? I'll give you the map and address. No official report on a nationwide outbreak but seems like millions are infected in Seoul. All we need is a sample to find the cause. Check the local high school first. Does it look serious? I don't think we'll need the insecticide. Just give it some antibiotics for now. Okay antiobiotics for now. The tree must be in a lot of pain right? It'll get better soon as long as we take good care of it. Does it require surgery? I'm not sure... this is a first. It doesn't look contagious or that awful crown gall disease. It'll get better once we give it medicine and disinfect it right? I agree. Seems like the soil around here is contaminated. Collect a sample for the epidemiology test. Alright. But don't you smell something funny? - What kind of smell? - Like a rotting corpse. Hey brother, who am I? I'm Jingoo! Okay, okay, but it won't be easy getting that kind of tree with that amount of cash. It's only possible because of me. C'mon now you can't plant those trees on the golf course by yourself. It's expensive, anyway let me know what you want and I'll get it for you. Hey what are you doing over there? Get down! Hey man, if you needed a ride, wave your hand, stop the truck and ask nicely "Sorry to trouble you but can I get a ride?‚Äù - Where are you taking them? - Them? Who? Who are you? The police? When did you get here? Today. You should've told me I would've went to the airport. There's no fun in that. Have you been well? Have you been well? I missed you so much. When are you leaving? Do you have to go? I came home today and you're already worried about me leaving? It felt like you were away for a million years. I'm sorry and thank you. That's not enough. Say I love you. - I love... - Did you eat dinner? - I ate already. - Take your meds. I took them no, I'm taking them now. Are you sick? - I think I was In a car accident. - Car accident? It's been awhile, don't worry I don't even remember it. Baby are you ok? Are you hurt? It's nothing. Don't worry about it. It's really nothing. No.. No.. it's not my fault. Mom! What were you dreaming about? - I don't know. - Let's go to the hospital today no matter what. - You're sweating... - I'm okay. I'm really busy today. It's time for your meds. - Wait you forgot your medicine. - I don't want it. - Cheong Ah! - I don't want it! Cheong Ah please. I don't care it you're forced just take them for me. Why did you bring me here? - Want some? - Answer me. I want to ask you something. Han Jeong Hoon... Is it Han Jeong Hoon? Why do you like him? Then why do you like Cheong Ah? Because she doesn't like me. What kind of psycho answer is that? Cheong Ah liked flowers and trees very much. Like my mother. Right? The only thing I want is for Cheong Ah to remember me. You're a psycho. Back then and even now. You haven't changed one bit but... what are you going to do if Cheong Ah never remembers you? If she can't remember? What if she really can't? Kill her. That's how you've lived your life. If she can't remember me then I'll have to Kill her. But that won't happen because she will remember me. This is my last one. What about you? I'm done and have been at the office awhile ago. You're still out? I tried to work quickly and didn't realize the time. - Just finish it tomorrow. - I can't, I'll just do it quickly. Good work and I'll see you tomorrow. - What are you doing here? - Grandpa... Thank you. Did you see a ghost? A ghost? There was a natural burial at that tree. Not all but some have resentment and can't rest in peace. They use the energy from the tree's soul to roam around. I'm getting goosebumps. Instead of goosebumps I would say it's a sad thing. Every tree has a story It Just evaporates. What brings you here at this time? There's a sick tree out here and I'm a tree therapist. Humans have a lot of resentment and greed. Trees are different. It's not easy to move a tree that's been deeply rooted into the earth. That's why they're sick. Their heart aches. Trees have heartaches... Good topic for a dissertation. - Sounds like fun. - Did you say fun?! Go home before I give you a hard time. I apologize. Grandpa, isn't it scary living here all by yourself? There's nothing scary here. People are scary. I was so scared. It's okay, everything is okay now. Thanks for coming. You give me strength just by being next to me. This can't be. Don't do It. I'll take care of it. Now is not the time. She doesn't even remember you. I think I now know why people are afraid to die. It's because they will vanish from people's memories. I'm home. - What about dinner? - I ate. - Your medicine. - I ate it. Mom, what is this? A package came for you. It's Jeong Hoon. Remember me, friend. (Cho Han Ki) You dropped this. You like flowers. And trees too. What's up Cho Han Ki? What's up? I know you like flowers and trees. And? I wanted to give you this. It's pretty. Like you. Thank you but... don't waste your money. My mom owns a hacienda and I paid for this by working for her. My mom owns a hacienda and I paid for this by working fer her. That pervert is at it again. Why did it have to be Jeong Hoon's bitch? What? Bitch? Are you out of your mind? - Jeong Hoon... - If I ever catch you doing this again I'll fuck you up. You have to remember me because I will remember you forever. You dropped this. - Mom! Mom! - What? Remember when I told you I lost this. I found it while doing the laundry and put it in your room. When? A few days ago. What's wrong Cheong Ah? I think someone was in our house. Who? I don't know. I don't know why strange things keep happening to me. That's why you need your medicine. Mom please! Now she remembers me. That's right. Hello? Did I wake you? No. What is it? It's about the soil sample... I'm pretty sure I dropped it oft In the lab but it's not there. What? The sample we first got at the highschool. Come on Hye Rin focus. - We work with living things. - I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm the one that's sorry. I've been... Stressed out right? Cheer up! I love you! Thanks. - Hello. - You're here! It's been awhile. - I know, sorry I called you out of the blue. - It's okay. - Here you go. - Ah it was this one? How long will it take? Normally it takes some time but I'll have it for you right away. - Thanks I appreciate it. - Okay. Why isn't it getting better? I want to study again and I miss my friends. I'm not sure what's going on but have courage. As long as you're determined... That's why I came back. I came back because I miss everything... It's too painful being here. My body hurts a lot too. I want to go back. Help me please. Hello? It's me. Is something wrong? No it's nothing. I have the results for the soil analysis. - Should I email it to you? - Yes please, thank you. The unusual thing is there's a large amount of calcium phosphate. In simpler terms human bones have a lot of It. Did you dig up a grave? I came back because I miss it. I came back because I miss it. I came back because I miss it. Do you remember everything now? Don't run away. I came here to see you. I'm not going to run away. If I run now I'll live as an empty shell for the rest of my life. I don't want that kind of life. I only wanted you to be happy. It didn't matter to me who you loved. You asked if I remembered everything... I don't... I don't know why Jeong Hoon died and left me here. Why can't I remember everything? You really want to know? I'm the one that killed him. What? It was to make you happy. It doesn't make sense. Cheong Ah! Cheong Ah! Cheong Ah is really pretty right? Yes she is. It's pretty. - Do you like this the best? - They're all nice. What do you think Ji Hyo? It's pretty. I don't really like it. What about the other one is it pretty? We don't have it today but it you give us a few days we'll find it for you. We don't have it today but if you give us a few days we'll find it fer you. - I appreciate it. - Okay I'll look into it. Ji Hyo you have to come visit us in England. He acts like this around you but when we're alone he's apathetic. He'll be too busy studying and won't have time for me. We have these colors which you can wear normally. The brighter color is for the top right? This one's pretty right? Yeah I like it. You think everything's nice. Looks better on you. - Really? - Use this when you get married. It's so pretty. This one's so pretty. - Is this embroidered by hand? - Yes it's all done by hand. - Does this suit me? - Yes it suits you well. Yes. Cheong Ah really likes it. Yes. No, thank you. I'll buy you dinner when I get to Lendon. Thank you again. Yes, okay, take care. I'm leaving. Already? Have dinner with us. You too? You know I have feelings for you. Why do you think she called me out today? Because you're friends. It's a warning telling me to back off. - Ji Hyo it's not like that. - I'm leaving. Alright then let me get you a cab. Baby come inside. - Hurry. - Ji Hyoe's leaving I think she has plans. Oh really? Goodbye. Take care, I'll call you later. I don't know how to accept this but... Ji Hyo you're just a friend. I'm getting married to Cheong Ah next week and leaving South Korea right after. You shouldn't be... - I'm not telling you not to get married... - I'll pretend I didn't hear it. It you keep doing this the three of us can't be friends. Don't you think you have some responsibility for this? How many years has it been since the three of us have been friends? We have a lot of memories don't we? But we weren't friends. I was the third wheel on your dates. - Don't say that. - It's the truth! You're right I'm responsible. The thing you did wrong the most was you knew how I felt but you kept me next to you and Cheong Ah and let me exist as just a friend. Ji Hyo. You're gorgeous and charming. But I can't choose you over Cheong Ah. We can't meet after I'm married. Your feelings for me is obsession, and jealousy over Cheong Ah. I'm going. What? Is Jeong Hoon with you? He's not picking up his phone. Did he tell you he was meeting me? What are you saying? Anyways can you help me? I'm going crazy! Where you going? Should I just sit and watch? He's not himself you don't know what he'll do to you. Do you want to die? Are you crazy? - Should I just watch? - The police are on their way just keep calm. He won't hurt me. If he wanted to the house would've already been on fire. Please don't do this. You shouldn't kill yourself for me. I never said I was doing it for you. I said I wanted to see your face one last time before I die. Please just stop it! If you die I'll never ever forgive you. I was happy because of you. I wish you happiness or I won't forgive you. Okay? It looks like heavy mental shock. Is she going to be okay? I can't say much now. We'll keep watch. Cheong Ah, Cheong Ah wake up it's mom wake up. We'll run more tests once she's stable. We're already graduating. I know right. This Is the last time. - What is? - This place. That old desk and banana milk. Should we stay here? - You know what's sad? - What? This...this right here. I sort of liked flipping it back. It you're that sad about it leave it on forever. Ah didn't think of that. Why don't you put it on your forehead? Hey Han Jeong Hoon! I didn't want you to remember. I couldn't remember anything but the tree remembered everything. It was like Jeong Hoon was looking for me. I'm sorry. No I'm sorry. It must've been hard for you. When you lost your memory my heart dropped but I thought it was fortunate. I was afraid you would go through that immense pain all over again. Those painful memories are a portion of my life and something I need to overcome alone. Don't worry mom. Cheong Ah! Cheong Ah! Where's Cheong Ah? - Cheong Ah? - You said she was hurt. I wanted to talk to you so I lied. You are ridiculous. Don't go! If you leave now I'll kill myself. Ji Hyo. Hold me just once. Stop. This won't change anything. I don't want anything to change I just want you to know my feelings for you are sincere. I know your feelings for me are sincere. But this isn't right. Then kiss me for the first and last time. A goodbye kiss. - Ji Hyo! - Please... Just stop it. I'll get along with Cheong Ah like we used to. Why are you here? I saw you trying to kill yourself in front of Cheong Ah. So what? You don't think I could do it? No it's not that. Honestly it was touching. I can sort of understand your feelings for Cheong Ah. Understand? You understand my feelings? Homoscedasticity. Homoscedasticity? Yeah I thought since we share the same pain we can help each other. You're going to help me? There's no one In this world that can help me. I was always alone. You weren't lonely because you had Cheong Ah. Am I wrong? Don't talk about her that way If you don't want to die. Coward, it Cheong Ah marries Jeong Hoon she'll be miserable. Don't you want her to be happy? Why would Cheong Ah be miserable? Because Jeong Hoon is in love with me. You're lying. Lies. Lies! - Is this the dress? - Yes. I had a hard time finding it. Thank you. Mom what do you think? My daughter is so pretty. Ji Hyo! Cheong Ah... What are we going to do? What are you talking about? Jeong Hoon... Jeong Hoon? What about Jeong Hoon? I must've crazy, you guys looked so happy, I did it because I was mad at myself. What did you do? - I told Han Ki.. - Han Ki? All I did was tell Han Ki you would be miserable if you married Jeong Hoon. Cheong Ah! Cheong Ah! Cheong Ah where are you? Lee Cheong Ah this is all your fault. Think about it it you weren't here there wouldn't be a problem. Am I wrong? It it wasn't for you! If it wasn't for you! Cheong Ah! Mom... mom... My Cheong Ah is so beautiful. Really. You should get this when you get married. This is so pretty. Already? Have dinner with us. Ji Hyo you're just a friend. Don't go! Hold me just once. I'll get along with Cheong Ah like we used to. Lies... You never smiled at me like that ever. Why do I look pitiful? You hate me right? I hate me too. This isn't what I wanted, it was all an accident. You know that right? Stop smiling. If you smile like that... my heart flutters. I'm such a fool. Every time I think about you... my heart beats for you. Every tree has a story it just evaporates. It's not easy to move a tree that's been deeply rooted into the earth. That's why they're sick. Their heart aches. Were you hurt? It's nothing. I want to go back. Help me please. - You're not making any sense. - If we don't plant them back or else they'll die! The trees used for natural burials moved next to the people they miss? Are you kidding me? And it we want to save them we have to bury them in it's original place? Yes it's all true. How are you going to take care of the expenses? Are you? Cause I can't! I can't do this alone! I'll let it go this time. Just go home. I don't even have the strength to resent you. This isn't what I wanted. It was all an accident. It's time for us to go back. We're not supposed to be here. Will you forgive me? You'll have to ask Cheong Ah for forgiveness. Let's stop bothering her and go back. I'm asking you please. What are you doing? - Why do you miss him? - Please don't do this. - Mom! Mom! - What is it? What happened to the tree in front? I don't know It was there this morning. Cheong Ah please... He won't be able to bother you anymore. I dug up the tree from it's roots. Cheong Ah you're here. What are you doing? Stop it now! I wanted to get rid of them before I bring you here. - Get rid of them? - Jeong Hoon and Ji Hyo What? They're bothering you even when they're dead. I couldn't let that happen. Who's bothering who? You killed Jeong Hoon he was innocent! - Ji Hyo died because of you too! - She was following Jeong Hoon. No one was forced her to die. Know what's scary about Ji Hyo she didn't resent me after she died. As if killing Jeong Hoon wasn't a problem. Because she took him away from you and following him made her seem happy. I will never forgive you for this. I loved you so much. I wanted you to be happy. I wanted to be with you so much. Did you? Not me. I won't be with you. I won't like you. I knew from the beginning that you wouldn't like me. It doesn't matter. Please stop acting pitiful, innocent, and naive! You're just a psycho. I don't know about everyone else but I thought you would know my sincerity. You are delusional. Oh yeah? You were everything I was living for. What are you doing Han Ki? Stop! Without you I can't live. I'm doing this because I don't want you to see me die. Go first. I'll be there soon. I couldn't leave because I miss you. I still can't believe It. Is this a dream? It must be a dream. Live happily and well even if I'm not here. Don't get sick either. Don't talk like that. I can't let you go yet. Where do you think you're going? You're here now but I know In our hearts we're always together. I take solace in knowing that. I'm here... I'm right here, don't go please. I'll remember each and every memory we had together while we were in love. I love you Cheong Ah. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go... Don't go... Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go! Don't go... Don't go. I'm going to Jeong Hoon. I'm going to Jeong Hoon. What? I'm going to Jeong Hoon. Don't go. Don't go! If you go I'm going to die for real. You don't think I can do it? You don't think I can die! Don't die. Don't die Han Ki, not you too. Please. Because I know one day I'll be with Jeong Hoon so I'm not going to think too hard about it. As long as I live and remember, we are still together. Han Jeong Hoon You're not hurting anymore right? Hyun Ji Hyo Let's not hurt anymore okay? Those that are born again, carve their memories... into the branches and leaves. Those that they love... and miss are engraved entirely.. Becoming a beautiful bountiful tree.
