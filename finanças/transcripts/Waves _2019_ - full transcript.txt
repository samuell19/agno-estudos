Like it was cool, but... Hey, wake up. - Let's go! - Yeah, I'm up. - Downstairs in five. - All right. - You ready? - Yeah. Go. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not rude. It doesn't boast. Love also forgets wrong. If we spent more time loving one another, hate would cease. So you have a choice. Love works better. Love is better for us. It makes the world better, but we have to be in action. How much... How do you want to love? How can I love? Well, you know what, it could be just by a smile. - A smile on your face could... - A smile. Amen. - ...change somebody's day. - Yes. Amen. Now you choose whether you use the love correctly. So I want to remind you that love is a four-letter word, and so is hate. We're in a world full of hate right now. Everybody's pointing a finger at somebody else. And you're no good. And you're no good. And we're no good. And they're no good. Ain't nobody good right now. So we need love to bring people back. There used to be an old thing when I was growing up that says it takes a village to raise a child. It's gonna take that same village to bring us back to love as a country. ♪♪ What a difference a day made ♪♪ Twenty-four little hours ♪♪ You get in late last night? Not really. Not really, huh?

She just better not be going with my ass, all right? - You are your sister's keeper. - Since when? It's not like it's your prom. Is Alexis excited? Yeah, I hope so. She's had her dress for long enough. - How was your day? - Exhausting. Oh, that divorce is happening. I have some notes for you to do. I keep telling her if she'd spread her schedule out and worked Fridays, she wouldn't be so exhausted. My patients have me until Thursday. Come Friday I want to be with my babies. Kiss? There's my girl. Good day? Yeah. Not bad. - You done with your homework? - Not yet. What you waiting for? I just came down to say hi to Mom. It's a two-second break. - Oh. - How's your knee? The usual. - Go make your bath. - Yes, ma'am. Hey, you didn't take any of my pain pills, did you? - No. Why? - It's all good. SLAP stands for Superior Labrum Anterior and Posterior. This top area here is where the biceps tendon attaches to the labrum. That's why you are also feeling pain running up your arm. Now, in your case, if you don't remember a specific event, then you could have aggravated your shoulder and then over time, with repetition, made it worse and worse. Since it's the labrum, it's not just overhead activities. Any strenuous activity on the biceps tendon will enhance it, as well. Okay, um... I'm sorry. So, like, what... What does that mean? Well, you've done extreme damage. You have a level five out of five SLAP tear. I've never actually seen this level tear in person. Well, I mean, it's not that bad. I could easily push through it. I'm afraid you need surgery or you're running the risk of permanent, irreversible, damage. But I'm... But I'm in season right now, so... I understand. But Tyler, this is very serious. I highly recommend you stop all physical activity immediately and we get you surgery as soon as possible. Wait, what if... What if we did it, um... What if we did it at the end of season and I could, you know, I could recover over the summer? And I could be ready for next year for college? I can't see you making another match, let alone an entire season. Then, to be honest, recovery would take much longer than just the summer. You're likely never to fully recover to the way you were, but the sooner we address this, the better. You're young and you'll heal very well. It's going to take time. I can call your mom if you... No, you don't have to do that. I'll... I'll talk to her. I'm very sorry, Tyler. That's one bottle of vodka. There you go. - You got it, bud? - Yeah. Ty, there's water coming through my door! Ty, there's water everywhere. What are you doing? Tyler? Geez. Every practice. Don't be a pussy. Let him up! What's the matter, Ty? Let's do this. I'm right here with you. Come on. Go. Come on. One.

What's this format? Why's the date over there? It's the format she told me to do. Can you just let me do my thing? I don't pay you to do your thing. I pay you to do my thing. - Technically she pays me. - You know, there you go again. - What's that attitude about? - What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. Hey, stop! Turn it off and look at me. Look around here for a sec. Who do you think keeps all this running, hmm? Now, your mother may be great with the patients, but she don't know nothing about running a business. You think if I quit my job and stopped running your mother's business, that you'd have a place to even lay that big head of yours? Huh? - No. - Then what's up? I mean, I just have a lot going on right now. Do you really? What, you think me and your mom don't got a lot going on? Wait until you get out on your own in the world and have real responsibilities. You got to be able to balance it, Ty. Now, we talked about this, brah. If you can't keep it going, you can forget about hanging out with your friends or running around with that little girl of yours. You... Quit shaking your head at me, boy. This is my house. If you don't like the way I run things, then you can be up out. I told you you didn't have to work for me and you didn't have to train with me. You asked for that. That was your choice, right? And I'm not the one who chose wrestling, but if you're gonna do something, you might as well do it right. I said it before, I'll say it again. The world don't give a shit about you or me. We are not afforded the luxury of being average. Got to work 10 times as hard just to get anywhere. It's... Ty, I don't push you because I want to. I push you because I have to.
