This is the day, this is the day That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made Let us rejoice, let us rejoice And be glad in it, and be glad in it... This is the day, that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it. This is the day, this is the day that the Lord has made. Great. - God Bless. - God Bless, Kuba. I was thinking... Would you like to take part in the end of school year Holy Mass? Carry offerings to the altar? - Dope, I guess. - Yes? - Would like a companion? - Maybe Monika? Monika... Why not? Are you two together? - Yes. For a few days now. - A few days. Great. - So we have a deal? - Yes. I'm very glad. - God be praised. - Forever and ever, amen. Okay, are you ready? Give me that, we don't have a lot of time. Three quick puffs each, okay? I can't do it that fast. Will mom be at the church today? She said she's got a cold and sauna burns away the germs. When I asked her if it has to be today... ...if it has to be today, she said "yes" and got offended. That's our mom. What the fuck are they drilling through? - Okay, I'm off to the pitch. - Cool, see ya. Sit down. When did he get so muscular? While he was repeating a grade, probably. - Wonder if he grew in other places, too. - What's it to you? - She's got a new guy, I'm curious. - I didn't penetrate the subject yet. "Yet." Not bad. Take your tee off. What do you want me to do? Do something. Yo! What's up, dude? Okay, I'm hitting the pool. Yo, what's up? Hey, guys. You dyed your hair, you lookin cool! Hey, sweetie. Hey, girls! Hey, man, didn't recognize me? You can't enter with your clothes on. - What caption? - I dunno. Look, Yellow is about to jump. I have to tell you something. I think I have a boyfriend. Who? Yellow. Forty likes so far. - That's poor. - Yeah. - Did you tag me? - No. I'll do it now. Tagged. Why won't he come to you? Would be lame if people saw him hanging out with a 15 year-old, right? - What do you want? - Hi, Oli. Go say "hi" somewhere else. We have important things to discuss. Fuck off. Yellow, watch out! Jesus, I'm sorry. You have a great serve, you know? Not always, as you can see. Still pretty good How old are you again? Fifteen. I turn this year. I thought you're thirteen. - It's cool, don't worry about it. - Bye. What's up? I told the girls about you and Yellow. You're not mad, are you? No, but keep it between us, okay? How is it with Yellow? It's OK. Just don't tell anyone at school because I could be in trouble. Kwiatkowska's folks grounded her for a month for making out with an older guy. - She was turning 15, he was 18. - Fifteen is fifteen. Yeah right! There is a difference if you're born in January or December. True. Hey, bro! - Who's got a joint? Pass me the joint! - Fuck off. - How old are you? - Forty! More like fifteen. - Come on! - What? You heard him. Fuck off! You will want something from me, Baldy. What could he possibly want from you? How old is your brother? - Dunno, fifteen? - So I was right! Super smooth. Here. Cover yourself. Thanks. He really likes you. Okay, let's go. Are you out of your fucking minds? Turn that down. Tomek! Come get the groceries. I'll come by later. Give me that. Give it to me, I'll do it. So now. You even it out. You stretch it. And you roll it up. - Here you go. - Nice. OK, let's just smoke it. Okay. They just killed me, anyway. On the balcony? Yeah. - I don't know if she came. - I would know. When it comes to that, chicks are great actresses. - They do know how to pretend. - Right? - So how did you know she came? - You just know. - Hey, dawg. - What's up? Do you want to shave me bald? - What, your head? - Yeah. Are you sure about that? Think so. Come on then, I have a shaver. But you're cleaning up after. We're putting on a great show with the girls. Why weren't you there? I got baked at Kuba's place. Stayed there until 5 AM or so. He's not texting me back. Probably still sleeping. We don't really have to go to school anymore, right? Did you talk to him today? No. I guess you don't have to go to school if you wanna repeat a grade again. Dope hair. Or rather lack of... What's your problem? Nothing. Remember when you first showed up with that blonde hair? I was at church, in a queue to the confession booth. Owczarek said: "Rutkowski dyed his hair like a faggot". I got pissed off and smacked him in the face. And then I had to confess it. I don't remember any of that. I thought you liked the hair. Stop thinking so much, then. Chill out a bit, okay? Tight ass. Hey. Yo. - Yo, Baldy! - Hi. - You ready? - Partay at the Pyramid! - But they won't let me in. - They will. - Okay, but I gotta be home by 11. - Deal. Let's black out. Grab your chick. - Hi. - Hey. Julia, I'm pregnant. So what now? I don't know. - Does Yellow know he'll be a father? - Oh fuck. Someone says here you don't get a period. But this other girl says you can still have it. That your breasts hurt, and that you should go to a gyno to make sure. Why not go to a doctor and check it? Sure. So that everyone here finds out. Hi, Oli. I read that when people who love each other kiss, it creates a massive flow between the anuses. - What? - Sick shit. What the fuck are you reading? I'm sorry, but what the fuck? I think you should have a YouTube blocker or the entire Internet, or something. But I didn't see that on internet. That's even worse. Where? In a fucking book? I think... I read it on Reddit. Oh right, that's not on the Internet. It looks fucking amazing. One from the side now. Now you take one. Come on, dude. Why your eyes so red? Dunno. - Why the fuck aren't you picking up? - You called? I didn't hear it. I'm sorry. - Will you put sunscreen on me? - No. - Come on...do it - You think "I'm sorry" is enough? I'm sorry. What else do you want me to say? - I didn't hear it. - Dunno, maybe turn your ringer on? - Will you put the cream on? - No. I can do it. Okay. Cool. What are you doing? Go ahead, then. Keep doing that. What? Am I bothering you? C'mere. Let it go. Come here. - Give me back my hoodie. - What? My black hoodie I gave you so nobody'd see the hole on your ass. - Oh, that. Thanks. - Fuck your "thanks". Give it back. I don't have it here. Chillax, you boob. I won't chill with a slut! - What the fuck? - Fucking exactly! What are you talking about? Half the school says you're fucking some older guy called Yellow. Who said that? You know what, I don't give a fuck. Come get it later. - Do you wanna go? - You're not buying anything? No, I'm not. Goodbye! Grab the towel. I can't find it. Don't call me a slut again. Okay. Or say that I'm a whore. I'm sorry. Or repeat such bullshit after others. Do you swear? I swear. So now fuck off. I won't talk to a guy who called me a slut an hour ago only because someone else said it. Goodbye. - Oliwia, but... - What? I like you. The door locks automatically. Bye. Do you have a girlfriend? - I do. - What's her name? - Monika. - Nice name. What's yours? Savage. - Savage? - Savage. What does it mean? Wild. - Wild? - Wild. - What about you? - Cold As Ice. Hot in here. Do you dance? Were you watching me? How about you? Do you like to dance? I do. - What style? - Fast. - Alone? - Alone. Where? In a garage. Is that tattoo real? Or fake? Wanna check? I do. So check it out. It is real. Is that your life motto or what? - "Woman", right? - No. But there's a "for" there, right? There is. - Don't you have to leave? - You haven't solved it. Don't worry I will. There's a pic on Instagram. I can work with. Okay. - Thanks. - Bye. - What do you want? - Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that then. Will you come to our basement later? I will. But let's not talk here. - Your mum lives in this room? - Yep, in the living room. - What about your father? - Don't even fucking ask. He fucking went to Germany, to work, like 10 years ago. And he just fucking disappeared. Fire it up. Don't you miss him? How can I miss someone who left me and our fam? And you? What kind of dad you think you'd be? Best one. I'mma be up to snuff. And my kids will turn out to be made of tough. - Here. - Anything left there? The beat starts now. "These events took place in Kosciuszko times. My lord supported the May 3rd Constitution. He had started to rally the gentry to join the fight: Then the Russians ringed the castle late one night. They'd barely time to fire the mortar in warning, Then close and bar the lower gate. That morning the only ones here were my lord, his lady, me, The cook, two kitchen helpers - drunk all three The priest, a lackey, four haiduks-these stood armed At the windows, bold men all. The Russians swarmed From the gate across the terrace with a cheer. We fired back with ten guns: 'Off with you there!' You could see nothing. From the lower floors The servants fired, my lord and I from upstairs. Despite the commotion, everything seemed fine: Here on the floor lay twenty guns in line; We're fire one, another would be handed us- I drew a bead; he stood as if nonplussed. I fired two shots at him; both times I missed- Whether from rage, or grief, my aim was bad. The women cried, I looked: my lord was dead." My lord was dead. Yeah, the lord was dead! - Fucking amazing! - Did you get it? I got it. - Are you going to the junior high prom? - Sure. It's the last one ever. How about a pregame here? Maybe. I'll ask Julia. She's a good girl. Cleans the house. Go and see our bathroom. I think she got that from her mom. Her mom... My wife could clean the toilet like nobody else. When was the last time you were in touch with her? Two years? - Maybe even three. - Maybe even three. What can I tell you? She left for work five years ago, She used to send some money at first, but later... She met someone or something, I don't know. - Fuck her. - Oliwia! She got her character from her mom as well. My apologies. - I get it. I have two at home. - Yeah? You must get it, then. - And? - And what? A bit Jesus-like, that probation guy, wasn't he?" Yeah. - I'm going to the store, want anything? - I'm good. You sure? - Sure. - I'll buy you something. No, thanks. Here's a tenner. - It's all I have at the moment. - Thanks. Okay then. - Bye! - Bye. Oliwia. - Will you give me a blow job? - No. Now you say no. What about last week? Last week doesn't count. Buzz off. Will you come out to the hall? No! Can I come in, then? Also no. I'll wait at the hall, then. Wait wherever you want. Bye. - I got your Facebook message. - And? - And what? - What do you think? - Tough luck. I'll just leave. - You will leave? - Me, who else? - I'm the one who's screwed, not you! You'll go to a maternity home. And my mom will fucking kill me. Kill you? Yes, why I have to leave. Chomik... The farthest you'll go will be to the pool. Fuck off. That's fucked up, brother. Give me a puff of that blunt. Ok, I'll make an exception. One puff. That's enough. Give it back. Give it back! Home. Now! - You're turning this place into a den! - Come on, mom. Five minutes. Chomik invited us to the junior high prom tonight. Said we could get in without a problem. Cool. - Are you angry? - No. Do girls always say they're not mad when they actually are? Do guys never call when they say they would? You'll see him in church. You're carrying the offerings together. Fucking great. Thanks for the info. - He'll be here soon, you'll talk to him. - I won't. I'm seeing the girls. Give me that, I can't look at you. Remember that time I told you there were rats in our toilet? And I was going to the neighbors to pee? You didn't think that they might be there as well? All the pipes are connected, aren't they? Terrible. I wrote you something on Facebook. Did you see it? No. You can't tell me now? Read it. - What? Did mom pull something again? - Just read it. Out loud. I woke up at 6:30. I'd had a very weird dream. I dreamt of touch. - You a fucking poet now? - Just keep reading. I was laying on a bed with someone. Far from each other. My head was by their feet, and their head, by mine. At some point... ...he... ...suggested we lie next to each other. So we did that. I was so nervous I closed my eyes, so my vision in the dream turned black and I could only feel him hugging me. The hug was getting stronger. My heart was racing, but the emotions paralyzed me, so I did nothing. Why didn't you do anything? I was scared. Of what? Rejection. Then don't be. - Was that about someone specific? - No, are you crazy? So is our toilet really connected with the neighbors'? Well, yeah. - Thanks. - Come on... - Yo. - Hi. Why are you still here? We're about to begin. Time for a selfie with the top student. Gotta go. - Got a smoke? - Sure. Thanks. Wait here. Come in. Thanks. Wait for a second. We have to wait three minutes. - Where did you get the money? - I stole it. - Did you get a probation officer? - No way. I burned the notice. Nobody came by? No, why would they? They came by our place. Asked about you. About me? Mom said they were doing a community interview. About you. - And? She badmouthed me, I bet? - No way. You know what she's like. She likes to nag, but she would never snitch on you. - Really? - I'm serious. - Were you there? - I heard some things from the kitchen. They asked about Rychu. Whether he's drinking. She said he isn't. She even said that some aunt visits you sometimes. Your mom's rock solid. Please, accept the probation officer. He'll only come once a month. You'll be able to live your life. It's not a big deal. I don't want some creep watching me. A lot of people are in that situation. He can't do anything. Some meetings, instant soup at the community center... Do I need an officer to eat instant noodles? It's positive. It will be okay. What the fuck are you doing? Are you out of it? - Put it away. - Brother, listen. I have a favor to ask. I really have to ask you. - Get me a bit of weed. - Fuck off. Go help mom. Come on Goska. Forget about it. - Do you know how to do that? - Sure I do. Hold this. And this. Okay. - Hold it. - Watch out. See? Cheers. Come on. - It's gonna be fucking awesome, right? - Yeah. It's gonna be great. Hold on, I'll snap some pics of you. With the champagne! C'mon. Wait. Okay. Now by the window. We're sorry. Bitchin. - Will you post it later? - Sure I will. Fuck yeah! Stop it! - Party! - Stop it. Class. - Wanna smoke? - Not right now. We didn't eat anything today. - So what? - Your butt. Give me a puff. I'll make you a bracelet out of this. Julia, go and join Kowal over there. - Stop it. - Please. Fine. So... wanna go to the store for some food? Sure. Then we'll smoke. So was Yellow the first guy you ever kissed? Of course not. I had to try first to avoid embarrassing myself. I kissed Chomik. - I knew there was something there! - He's cool. Got hair like Bieber. - You know who Kowal resembles? - Who? - Are we off? - Yeah. - Good evening! - Good evening. That will be 34 zlotys. - Let's get out of here, man. - Stop it. - Thank you, goodbye! - Goodbye. I don't want it. Let's go, please. We'll wait outside. - Okay. - What do you have there? Come back! - What? - I can see you stole a vodka! Security! - I can see everything! - But the girls are in the queue! - You were going to leave! - You can check the cameras! - Let's go. The girls too. - Why us? - Come on. - The day was too boring, huh? Shut it. Let's go now. - What's wrong with you? - What? Nothing. Hey dude! Come join us! - Wanna go there? - Are you crazy? - I'm not going there. - I'll just say "hi", okay? - Come on. Hi. - Yo. Will you have a drink with us? Yeah, sure. There you go. Hey, cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Remember that guy Yellow from the pool? Yeah, I do. I used to like him. And? Nothing. Now I know why. He was made up. Too bad everything else is for real. Come on, kid. Dawid... I can take her too, she's our neighbor. Out of the question. Next of kin only. - I would have come... - Save it for the parole officer. - My phone was dead. - Sir... She'll end up in a facility. The court will learn about all this. Do you know what time it is? Already past 1 AM. Goodnight. I'm sorry. - You've had enough, don't you think? - No. - I think I'm gonna head home. - Come on, walk me a bit longer. What are you doing? I'm not a faggot.
