Go. Go. Go. Charge. MAY, 1980 May I present Director Nomura, and Police Chief Yoshida. -What's the status?. -No progress, unfortunately. Our snipers got in close, but then they killed the driver in retaliation. We will never give up fighting for... the revolution, and refuse to negotiate with the nationalist police... or other imperialist government entities under any circumstances! On behalf of the proletariat, who are oppressed daily by the bourgeoisie... and imperialist Japanese government, we demand to speak to The Prime Minister, here, in person! If our demands are not met by midnight tonight, we will execute the United States Ambassador Hoover and his family. "DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF SAKAGI" Prime Minister, now is the time to... deploy the special forces. This is what they have been trained for. Don't worry, they're not kamikaze. But, like missiles, they are an indispensable weapon in this era. I have already given orders dispatching them to the location. Prime Minister, please Authorize their deployment Hurry up. OK, we're ready. Roger. Five minutes before midnight, then. What was that?. Enough with the questions. At 1 1:57, the police will send in the special forces. This is a top-secret operation. The police will take full responsibility for whatever happens. Got it?. On behalf of the oppressed proletariat, if our demands are not met... by 12:00 sharp, Ambassador Hoover, and his entire family, will be executed. Their blood will be on the hands of the... Japanese imperialist government and the bourgeoisie oppressors. This is not an empty threat. We are revolutionaries. Therefore, we must uphold the cause, and we do not fear death. We are only a part of a greater worldwide revolution. Positions! Charge! Where's the Prime Minister?.! Do you intend to ignore our demands?.! OK, let the countdown to the executions begin! You've got 60 seconds! You've got 50 seconds! No answer?. 40 seconds! Hey, what's going on?. What happened?. We're done here. In the Ground Self Defense Forces, the best and the brightest from each unit are chosen to form an elite group of special forces. This special task force was created to handle the most severe threats to national security, and the training exercises are made to simulate real-life situations. In fact, these exercises can be unbelievably brutal. Take, for example, this hillside training exercise. -Ready?. -Ready. -Jump. -Jumping! In an uninhabited wilderness, a single operative is left to find his way to the rendezvous point. Even for a one month exercise, he only receives provisions to last three days. After that, he must find his own food, without contacting local inhabitants. I'm ready. -OK, jump. -Jumping! Simply put, special forces troops must be able to exceed normal levels of human endurance. They must learn the survival skills of people in ancient times, facing the harsh realities of life in the wild, including hunger, isolation, strange vegetation and wild animals. Now, officer Ajisawa and his team were dropped off in remote areas in the prefectures of Aomoni, Iwate, and Miyagi, dispersed across a wide area, and the whereabouts of each are unknown to anyone.

Don't Kill my father! -How's it going?. -That's 12 people in all, boss. Seems like they were all killed with this. -The whole village, slaughtered?. -No, there's one missing. Yes, it seems there were 13 people living here in all. So one might still be alive. Crop fungus. Cabbages are particularly susceptible. We've had it in our village, too. See, it's spelled like this in Chinese characters. Hey, come take a look at this! She's not from around here. Probably a hiker. Just happened to be passing by. That's my sister. It's definitely her. She's had a shock, but she'll be OK. Here, you should eat something. You're Yoriko Nagai, right?. You were hiding in the barn here last night, weren't you?. Did you come by yourself?. -Green clothes. -Green clothes?. A man wearing green clothes. A man wearing green clothes brought you here?. Who was it?. Was it someone you know?. Yesterday at 2:00, after school, you went home to help with chores, right?. Then, in the evening, you ate dinner with your family, right?. Did you remember something?. What happened at your house?. What did you see?. Yoriko! Yoriko. What's wrong?. It's me, Dr. Inoue. The doctor says her memory loss was caused by severe trauma. She has no memory of the incident. Can they really afford to take her on?. They don't seem at all well-off. -Well, it can't be helped. -They are her only relatives. They already have five small children. And now there's another mouth to feed. A man wearing green clothes. HAJIRO CITY, TOHOKU ONE YEAR LATER AIRPORT GRAND OPENING CEREMONY What is it?. I feel like someone's watching. CSI, over here! Get some photos. Move, move, out of the way! It's Tachikawa, from the Hajiro Times. -Tachikawa! -Out of the way! Please move! Now, development in the rural areas is development for the entire country. President Mori, Hajiro Gas. So nice to meet you. Today's policies are really very detrimental to the rural prefectures. President Nagai, Hajiro Transport. So nice to meet you. And this is President Shimaoka, of the Hajiro Times. So the rural prefectures really need to become economically independent. And this is... This is my youngest son, Naruaki He's finally done with school, and learning the family business. Such a fine young man. What about the Self Defense Forces?. That would be nice, but he s my only son, you see. When it comes to his son he's an old softie. HAJIRO POLICE STATION The body belonged to a 33 year old male, Makoto Tachikawa. The driver was a hostess at Club Ginga, Akemi Izaki, age 29. The reason for the crash was either falling asleep or drunk driving. Are you sure it was an accident?. What do you mean?. Mr. Tachikawa was a very cautious person. He wouldn't ride with a drunk driver. Tachikawa was drinking, too. The autopsy shows that. Akemi Izaki's husband is part of the Nakado crime ring, and has a record. That's right. And a "cautious" man wouldn't be involved with her. Excuse me. -Excuse me. -What is it?. Izaki's body has not yet been found. Are you closing the investigation?. You're new to me. Are you with the press?. Life Insurance Company. Akemi Izaki's Insurance Broker. That river has seen many suicides and accidents. Once a body falls in, it is never recovered. At least 10 people have been lost in its murky depths. Just ask one of the reporters. Ajisawa! This is your case. This policy is worth 2 million yen, 60 million in case of accidental death. Isn't it suspicious that the accident happened... within 10 days of the effective date?. IZAKI What?. You're saying you won't pay?. When we opened the policy, you made it seem so clear-cut and simple. But now you're complicating matters to get out of paying. You're just a con-man! I'm not saying we won't ever pay. We just need more time to confirm your wife's death. Come back again later. I'm through discussing it with you. Bring me your manager. Once you die, that's it. It no longer matters if you were the number one hostess, when you're drowned in the muddy river. Then you're just fish food! Devoured, bones and all. I'll take care of it. Get up! Leave her alone. -Stop it. -Stay out of it! -Hey, stop it. -I said stay out of it! Now, beat it! We're part of Nakado's group. You don't wanna fuck with us. Got it?. Now fuck off! -You OK?. -Leave me alone! Go away! I'm sorry. Hey. If you want to stay alive in this town, you'd better not make waves. Whatever happens, just look the other way. It can't be helped. We can't change the way things are. Are you OK?. MEDICAL CLINIC Yes?. Hello. Are you Mr. Ajisawa's daughter?. I'm Tomoko Ochi. -I came to see your father. -Please come in. Leaving already?. Seems it's nothing serious. Thanks for coming though. -Thank you so much, for yesterday. -Don't mention it. Sorry for the trouble. I'll put the flowers over here. What's your name?. What is it, Yoriko?. Someone's there. Where?. Outside the door. -What?. Yoriko Nagai?. -Yes. And who's the guy?. An insurance salesman, Ajisawa. He's ex-Self Defense Forces. -Self Defense Forces?. -Could he be a relative?. And there's more. The sister of Misako Ochi, the hiker killed in the village, visited Ajisawa at the clinic. -Oh, the one who looks like her twin?. -Yeah. Do you think maybe Misako Ochi was accidentally killed, and the intended target was actually her sister?. So then he killed the whole village because they witnessed the murder?. If that's true. then both the sister and Yoriko are in danger. Ajisawa must be involved somehow. Ground Self Defense Forces, Hachinohe Branch Ground Self Defense Forces General Affairs Office, Sendai Minagawa. This came from the Hachinohe office. The Iwate Prefecture police are investigating Ajisawa. Inspector Kitano, Iwate Prefecture Police Department. The police received an inquiry about Ajisawa's background, from someone engaged to marry one of his relatives. What kind of inquiry?. The reason for his discharge. Of course, the Hachinohe office doesn't know the truth. So they just said he left of his own accord. After he quit, did you lose track of him?. No. He's on the watch list, so we monitor his movements closely. He needs to be dealt with immediately. We'll be under review during the next Diet session, so this is a crucial time. If Ajisawa gets arrested, we will be held publicly accountable. You said you'd be responsible for his discharge, right?. Don't let your personal feelings interfere with your duty. -Understood?. -Yes. This police report, signed by the chief himself, confirms accidental death. It's a very well-documented report. So how can you deny payment?. Koyama, what's this about?. Ajisawa hasn't turned in his investigation report, so... What?. What the hell is this?. Neither the police nor the Nakado Group are to be trusted, is that it?. You're really something. OK, I'll make sure to spread the word that anyone who buys your insurance will never get paid for their claims Hello. What are you doing?. This is called, "plastic concrete." I found it inside Izaki's car, which was recovered here. It's a special substance used in constructing dikes. Well, no matter how hard you try, I don't think you'll find Izaki's body. Tachikawa never touched a drop of alcohol. I think someone forced him to drink and pushed him over this cliff. So I don't think Akemi Izaki was even in the car with him. You mean he was murdered?. But a truck driver said he saw them in the car together on that day. It was a Hajiro Transport truck, right?. Part of the Oba family empire. Just like the rest of this city. They even control the police. Tachikawa was trying to expose that injustice. My parents died here, too. It's Ajisawa. HACHINOHE CITY AOMORI Oh, he's my type. Introduce us! -He quit already. -Oh?. Only an idiot would quit the Self Defense Forces! It's peacetime, so you can get paid for just sitting around! That's right! He quit the SDF?. Yeah. Just plumb disappeared. Been about three years now. Why'd he quit?. I have no idea. Move it, you old bag! You OK?. -Gonna dig up the reservoir. -Ma'am -My son, he's trapped down there. -Ma'am Ma'am, it's dangerous here We'll take you back home. I'm sure that sounded strange to you. About once in two years, the river overflowed and everything flooded. Each time, the local farmers were devastated. The Oba family saw an opportunity. They bought the land for next to nothing, and quickly got government approval to build the reservoir. Then, the land prices skyrocketed to 500 times their previous worth. Yeah, I've heard of those schemes before. Tachikawa was about to expose this injustice. That old lady's son opposed the land price hike, and mysteriously disappeared. His mother has never been the same. That sign is for a project by Nakado Construction. That's Izaki's group. This is where the plastic concrete came from. I think this is where they buried Akemi. Mr. Ajisawa?. I really want to expose the Oba family's crimes. Can I count on your help?. Izaki. I take it your wife really drowned at the reservoir?. Why are you asking this now?. The police have already put it in their report. -Riaht, Nakamura?. -Izaki. There's a limit to how much the police can just look the other way. What?. If your wife really crashed in the car with Tachikawa, OK. We won't ask why the car went over the cliff. But, if your wife's body is buried somewhere else, well, that's something we just can't ignore. But if the body's never found, what's the difference?. You dumb idiot! I want your resignation notice, immediately. But, why?. Some guy's been analyzing the mud found inside the wrecked car. The investigation's closed?. Yes, the village murder investigation is finally over. We found the murderer. Who is it?. One of the villagers, Magoichi Nagai Yoriko's father. -Boss! -Kitano. Apparently he just flipped out. This is bacteria found in the crop virus. You saw it, right?. The fungus that made the cabbages go bad. Until now, it was thought to only affect crops. But the same bacteria was found in Nagai s brain during the autopsy. In lab tests at Iwate University, this bacteria caused monkeys to go mad. So we can assume the same thing happened to Nagai. Then who killed Nagai?. Maybe the villagers a killed each other. -Who's pressunng you?. -What?. Evidence suggests that Ajisawa was in the elite Special Forces unit. Special Forces?. What's that?. I'm not sure, but I think it's a secret division of the Self Defense Forces. If word got out that one of their officers slaughtered innocent people, the Self Defense forces would suffer irreparable harm. Stop imagining things! The case is solved. The investigation is closed. Just return to your normal post. What is it, Yoriko?. That truck. It scares me. It's OK. The light's green, we can cross. No! That truck means to kill you! Come on. No! It's scary! Dad! You OK?. Hajiro Trucking Company. -Hey. -Damn... Who the fuck are you?.! Who was driving this truck just now?. Who was it?.! -What the hell?. -Mr. Izaki told me to... What's all the ruckus out here?. So, you're Izaki, huh?. Yeah. What do you want?. Tell me this. -Why did you try to kill Ajisawa?. -Ajisawa?. Who's that?. Enough bullshit. I'm not one of your local police lapdogs. You're so full of shit. Did someone order a hit on him?. How should I know?. Don't know, huh?. I see. Then I'll have to bring you in. Show me the arrest warrant! The traffic report says it was an accident. No way. It was clearly a missed hit. -OK, arrest him. -Yes. Remember this. Ajisawa's mine. Hands off, or else. If Izaki's insurance fraud is proved. The police won't be able to call Tachikawa's death an "accident." That may be true, but Ajisawa's story alone is not conclusive proof. -That's why I'm... -Miss Ochi! You have a visitor. I'm sorry to pry, but can you tell me how you came to know Ajisawa?. He rescued me when I was threatened by a motorcycle gang. Is it possible that he and the gang were in cahoots?. What do you mean?. Maybe he staged the incident as a pretext for meeting you. Imposs... In fact, it seems you were the reason he came to Hajiro city. But... You know the girl living with Ajisawa?. -You mean Yoriko?. -Yes. Did he tell you anything about why he took her in?. She's not his real daughter?. Along with your sister, 12 residents of that little village were killed also, all except for one girl, right?. It couldn't be. Yes, It's her. I'm positive that he was somehow involved in that murder. Maybe he's the killer. No, it's negative, right?. Ajisawa residence. One moment. Somebody named Urakawa, from the Hajiro Times. Tomoko's father used to own this paper. Then, during the elections the year before last, he ran against the Oba-backed candidate. Please. During the election, he and his wife collided with a truck by the reservoir. Their car fell into the water, and they were never found. It was a Hajiro Transport truck. Tomoko teamed up with Tachikawa to avenge her parents. Now he's dead.too. I think she's next. She's trying to dig up the dike site. She says Akemi Izaki's body is buried there. Ajisawa, Please try to stop her. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll end up just like Tachikawa. Yes. Is Tomoko Ochi here?. I'm sorry, Tomoko is not here. Oh, good evening. Sorry about that. That's my sister. She died in an accident last year. We look alike, don't we?. People often mistake us for twins. Please. Um... I've decided to dig at the dike site. And... For that, I need to get my hands on the construction plans. Here's the construction plan for the day of the accident. Can I borrow this blueprint?. I'll join you. It's dangerous work. Frankly... you'd just be in the way. If you won't let me join you, I won't give you the blueprints. Haiiro Times. What the...?. Gimme some light. Thanks for your help. Now I don't have to do it myself. Hey. Go fill some buckets with river water. Tachikawa drowned in this bucket, too. Ajisawa! You'd better stop. See what he's capable of?. Stop! Stop it! Stop! Don't do it, Ajisawa! Ajisawa. Officer Kitano, Iwate Police. I've got my eye on you. -1.20 meters. -1.20 meters. It's a great shame that one person, unbeknownst to the rest of us, has sullied the dike development project with his improper conduct, causing some in our community to misunderstand the entire project. This is, of course, a source of deep distress for me personally. Hey, old lady! Come on, stop! You're gonna crack the concrete! My son is trapped under here! I know he's here! You crazy bitch! "VIOLENCE AT DIKE SITE" Ochi! What's the meaning of this?.! This article insinuates that there were larger forces behind Izaki's crime! Izaki already confessed to killing his wife out of jealousy about her affair. I just printed the truth, that's all. What do you call truth?. This is just suspicion and conjecture. It's just made-up stories! We're not a sleazy tabloid. Another story like this, and you'll be fired. I don't need any life insurance. Go away. Another time, then. Tough customer. It's OK. Now we know that they don't have insurance, right?. Ajisawa. I'd like to offer you this, in exchange for your resignation. Resignation?. Since you're a contract worker, you're not entitled to severance pay. About 80% of the local people here have something to do with the Oba family conglomerate. Any company that has "Oba" in the name, of course, plus... any of the companies bearing the city name, "Hajiro" in it. Hajiro Department Store, Hajiro Times, even the Hajiro Police Department... is tied in with the Oba clan. I'm sorry, but I have no choice. Sorry, try somewhere else. President Oba wants to see you. Get in the car. Oba Martial Arts Training Hall President Oba. Sir! This is Mr. Ajisawa. OK, that's enough! I'm glad you could come. -Naruaki! -Yes?. My youngest son, Naruaki. -You've heard a lot about -Mr. Ajisawa, right?. -I'm Naruaki Oba. Nice to meet you -I'm Ajisawa. This way. Please. How'd you like to work for me?. From all the stories I've heard, I've really taken a shine to you. I know all about your military record and why you were discharged. I've got a great vision for the balanced development of this area, with Hajiro city as the hub. It's a dream that no one in this area has been able to realize. If don't live to see it completed, then... Naruaki will take over. I'd like you to become his right-hand man. What do you think?. OK. class. Back to work! The Iwate police seem to have their eye on you. Need some help with that?. Proceed! How's Yoriko Nagai?. I expect your answer in two to three days. I'm home. What's wrong?. Yoriko. Um, I... It's your birthday, so I got a cake, but then I dropped it. Thanks. I'm sorry. Come on, don't cry. It's good. Let's eat it. What's wrong?. Yesterday during class, Yoriko suddenly crouched under her desk. When I reprimanded her, she said an earthquake was coming. I thought she was kidding around, but then the earthquake came. So she foretold the earthquake. Yes. And it's not only earthquakes. She says she predicts test questions, too. When she's studying at home, she can see which questions will be on it. And then it turns out to be right on. You mean she can foretell the future. I've noticed it, too. I see. Well, I don't know if this is related to clairvoyance, sometimes she draws eerie pictures. Usually she's draws very well, but it's like she's not even aware of what she's drawing. Perhaps you would like to consult a professional about this?. Yoriko! I wonder if you remember me?. I'm Officer Kitano, from the Miyano police department. Yoriko. How do you feel about your new dad?. I like him. Do you ever think of your parents that passed away?. I don't remember them. I see. You once mentioned a man wearing green clothes. Was it this man?. Isn't there a resemblance?. Well?. isn't there?. Doesn't he look like your new dad?. Yoriko. Take a good look. Yoriko. Leave her alone! You pervert! -What the hell?. -Stop preying on kids, you sicko. An Iwate police officer?. With Yoriko?. I mistook him for a pervert and started beating him up. Does he have anything to do with you?. Tokyo Seinan University, Memory Loss Research Center. The dog started to eat his food. He was really hungry, so he gobbled. Oh, no, he's drowning! There, in the red hat. Hurry and save him, or he'll die Now a big fish has come. Hurry and save him, or he'll be eaten! Yoriko's seemingly prophetic capabilities can be ascribed to what we call "eidetic images. With eidetic images, past and future events unfold clearly before one s eyes as if watching a movie. The ability to see these images is usually caused by some event. In Yoriko's case, a traumatic event. You mean, witnessing her parents murders. That's right. She was a very intuitive child to begin with, then that harrowing experience heightened those capabilities. Well, one thing s certain. That is, Yoriko s memory will come back, gradually. Her memory?. Her grades will improve, and her prophetic ability will become keener. Those are the signs that her memory is returning. However, I should warn you. I'm sorry to say this, but... I believe Yoriko is harboring some hidden feelings of hatred for you Hatred?. You said that she foresaw the truck incident, right?. Perhaps she had a latent desire to see you get hit by the truck, which was transmuted into an eidetic image that appeared before her Don't kill him! Don't kill my father! I want you to sue the insurance company. Why?. They let you go under pressure from the Oba clan, right?. Why did the Oba clan need to do that?. If it goes to court, this will come out. And then, Tachikawa's murder and what's happened at the dike site, everything will be brought to light. I'm sorry, I can't. Why?. There s something else I have to do. Yoriko, this is a place you know very well. Remember, Yoriko?. Look around. Try to remember. This is Tomio's house! This is Seiko's house! That's Osanuma's house. And Yoshio's house is over there. And that?. By the shrine over there, there's a persimmon tree. And that?. That persimmon tree, it's... Remember it?. No. Remember?. Who's house sit?. Try to remember. Yoriko. -Remember. -No! -Look at it. -No, I'm scared! -Come on. Come on. -No! Who's house is it?. Remember! -Yoriko! Remember! -No. I won't. I won't! -Yoriko. -No, my head hurts! It hurts! Help! My head hurts! My head hurts! My head hurts! Yoriko. Yoriko! What did you want her to remember?. That I committed murder. I killed her father. And your sister... Are you OK?. Here's some food and water. I'll go to the village for help. What is it?. Don't worry about me. It's OK. I'll be right back. As soon as she went to get help for me, she got involved in that grisly incident. Stop! Don't kill! Dad! Stop! Please, don't! The rules of this exercise strictly forbid contact with civilians. Why did you disobey orders?. The girl was about to be butchered. -Yes, I disobeyed orders, but what if... -Ajisawa! We are special forces. Even if your own family's about to be hilled you're still duty-bound to carry out your orders. Isolate him until we decide what to do. I heard you showed great courage in the Hoover mission. Why are you now so affected by killing one person?. Back then, I killed the enemy, as ordered. This time, it was my own decision. Therefore, I am responsible. Well, you can't go to the police. I'm sure you understand our situation. But, I killed a man. Enough! If you continue to dwell on your personal feelings, we'll put you in the Psych ward, as Robertson suggested. Commander. Ajisawa is sane. I will take responsibility. Please accept his request for discharge -Ajisawa. -Yes, Sir. Three years ago, you left a regular unit in Hachinohe to join the SF. It never happened. Got it?. Three years ago, you were discharged from your unit in Hachinohe. After that, you've had no contact with the Self Defense Forces. You were not at that mountain village. Do you swear?. I swear. I'm not able to do anything for you. And I... I can't help you, either. Yoriko... has a deep, latent hatred for me. That became clear at the hospital. That's why... No matter how much she will hate or despise me, I want to help her regain her memory. And as soon as possible, Iet her start forgetting me. For her, I think that will be the best thing. I'd like to forget all about this town, my parents, and everything else, and go away with you. Well, I guess... I should be going. This is impossible, Tomoko. The editors have completely deleted all relevant content. Then after the layout is approved. I'll get the typesetters to switch out an article. You can't do that. Listen, Tomoko. The Oba group is not to be trifled with. You should know that. I'm well aware of that. They killed my parents. We're no match for the Oba clan. When I was surrounded by the motorcycle gang, Ajisawa rescued me. No matter how many times they knocked him down, he kept getting up again. Again and again, they would knock him down and he would get back up. See?. Even when you're outmatched, you can still fight. That's what felt watching him that day. If you're knocked down you just get back up. OK, I'm done. You finish up. Typesetting department. Yeah, I'm Taoka. What are you talking about?. No, I don't know that shop. -Gimme a break -What's up?. Some shop I never heard of thinks I owe them a bill. It's absurd. It's from the president, so put a rush on it. Wanna go for a drink after this?. -Where are the printing presses?. -What's the big idea?. Show it to me! This just came off the press. Hey! Stop the presses! Everybody, keep working! Collect all of them! Now! Tomoko! All hell's broken loose. Run for your life! Hello?. Hello?. Dad! Something's happened to that lady! She's going to be killed! How'd you get that scratch?. Well?. There was a fight. Don't bullshit me! I can always tell when you're lying. Did you kill that woman?. Well?. I... I just... You think you can deceive your old man?. So what if killed her?. After all, you're... a murderer yourself, aren't you?. I'm not angry about the murder itself. That woman was an enemy of our family, and... of the entire city of Hajiro. I guess she had to be killed. However, as my heir and successor, you made two fatal mistakes. First... you did the deed yourself. Second, you lost your composure... and acted rashly, without a plan. As a leader, this behavior is unacceptable. There, now. Don't worry. You're my whole life. No matter what happens, I won't let any harm come to you. OK, Dad, I got us breakfast. So that's where you were. I heard this train has good food. Is your hometown in Chiba near the ocean?. Aren't you gonna eat?. Why'd you run away?. And why did you bring us back here?. I'll ask the questions. Why the sudden departure?. The reason I came here to Hajiro... was to look after someone who lived here. I was unsuccessful, so I wanted to get as far away as possible. You're referring to that female reporter who died. Seems it was a motorcycle gang. I need a cigarrette. Are you thinking of going after them?. Looking at you, I see a smoldering fire ready to burst into flames. I'm just an ordinary citizen. I've never thought of going after someone. Just an ordinary citizen, huh?. It's Yoriko, right?. How'd you like to stay at Uncle Oba's place tonight?. No. Why not?. Because that's the guy who killed the lady! -She's suffering! She's crying! -Cut it out. Ajisawa... You've got quite an unusual daughter there. Mr. Oba... my daughter is ill. I plan to move closer to Tokyo so she can get the treatment she needs. -Please let us go. -I will not. I'm quite attached to you. And I always get what I want. -Take them back home. -Yes. What is it?. Can't sleep?. We weren't able to go back to your hometown in Chiba. It's OK. We'll go another time. What is it?. They're coming. A whole bunch of people are coming to kill you! Ajisawa! It's the police! Open up! Warrant to search the premises. For what?. Evidence involving the murder of the female reporter. You're under suspicion of removing evidence from the crime scene. Oba ordered this search, didn't he?. Strip search the girl. Everyone's here. OK. I'll be staying here tonight. Sorry to keep you waiting. I had some pressing business. -Thank you for inviting us. -President Oba... they said we could observe their training exercises tomorrow. You'll ride in the chopper with us. I'll certainly look forward to it We are ready for you in the dining room. This way, please. Yoriko. Good evening. Ma'am?. There's a dead lady. The other lady, and this old lady were both killed by those people. What are you gonna do with me?. My Dad's gonna kill you, that's what. Don't worry about that. You're a valuable hostage. Ajisawa. Give him back. On any condition. You name it. We're going to keep him with us till we get to a safe place. I guarantee that you'll be safe right here. You can't be trusted. Now get out of our way. Hurry up! Nakado. Do as he says. He's the one who killed my father. This man killed my father. What do you have to say for yourself?. Yoriko. We're driving all the way to Miyano, OK?. Thanks for your help. Now I'll take the murder suspect off your hands. I arrested him. I'm taking him to Miyano. This is my jurisdiction. I'm afraid I can't let you take him to Miyano. We're holding up traffic. Get out. What the...?. Is there a problem?. No, it's nothing. Get out. And you, too! Hurry up! Do as he says. He s a killer, like me. So he's Special Forces too, huh?. Yes. He was my commanding officer. What's he going to do with us?. Well, unfortunately, you've learned the truth about me. You mean, they'll kill us?. Wow, I'm really impressed with our nation's Self Defense Forces! Still, if invaded, we d only be able to defend Japan for three days. I'm afraid we still lack the strength to ensure our national security. Mr. Oba, there's a call for you. -Go ahead. -Hello?. Oba speaking. What the hell is Nakado doing?. -What?. -What happened?. -It's Naruaki. Land the chopper! -Land?. I need to see Naruaki. -Please, take a seat! -Naruaki's been killed! -Please, calm down. -Naruaki. Naruaki. The suspect has infiltrated the training ground. Don't let him get away. GW. Do you read me?. This is GW. Come in. Who's he talking to?. His squadron. We've become part of their training exercise. They'll come here to kill us Don't be ridiculous. Special Forces is still part of the Self Defense Force. This is Japan! Special Forces was created to eliminate those Japanese who threatened the establishment by going against the system. Are you all insane?.! Then. what about her?. Roger. They're coming. Where's the key?. You're a killer, remember?.! Is that the squadron?. If they're in a chopper, there are 22 of them. I think we have only three options. This is AW. Come in. This is M2. GW, please come in. This field practice will last for three days. We can hide out here for the duration, or we can try to escape during the exercises, or we take on all 22 of them. I'll hold them here. You two go ahead. It's my duty to ensure that murderers like you are brought to justice. I'll bring you in, no matter what. These guys have no regard for human life. While you sit there pontificating, we'll all be killed. Please. Take her and go on ahead. You're out of your mind. You and those guys outside. You're all crazy! This whole situation is completely insane! Advance! Are you OK?. Let's take a break. OK, I'll check the area. Wait! Don't even try to escape. This way's south, so if we keep going straight we should be OK Let's go. Shit! They sure play dirty, shooting at us from behind like that. Let's make a run for it! What are you doing?. Get some sleep. I'll stand watch. No. I'm awake. Don't worry. I've got nowhere to run. What should we do?. This might help us. They're regular Self Defense Forces. I'll give it a try. Halt. What are you doing in this area?. It's off-limits for civilians. I'm sorry. We've lost our way. OK, we'll guide you back. We're headed back to HQ anyway. Thank you'very much. I think they're lost. They've been intentionally thrown off track. Yoriko! Were they really Self Defense Forces?. Killing each other like that... Yoriko. Where are you going?. To get some water. I'll go get some. You wait here. If you pull this trigger, a bullet shoots out. OK?. Be careful. They're here. How could you give the gun to the kid?. Let's get out of here. Yoriko. Grab on to me. Ajisawa. Are you OK?. Once we're over this mountain, we'll get to a doctor. Just hang on a little longer. We can't let him live. He just wasn't ever able to become completely ruthless. And that soft spot has become his downfall. Get out! Over here, you wackos! You OK?. It's a dead end. OK, let's get out. Come on, hurry. Kitano! Come on, stop! Try to stay alive, OK?. Yoriko... Listen carefully. This is the brake. We're on a slope. Push down to move. Pull up to stop. And... this is your aunt s address in Chiba. As soon as you get there, make sure you see a doctor. I'll put some money in here. Yoriko... Wait till the choppers are gone, then go. Dad. Yoriko! Go back! Dad. Yoriko. Yoriko! Yoriko. Dad. Thank you. Yoriko. Yoriko. Here we go.
