BANNEC. On an island where winter storms wipe out all forms of life... four men come in two teams to spend the summer collecting seaweed in total isolation "There should be one or two bottles left in my trunk. If you want to share a toast..." "You broke my last bottle of plonk! Give me my knife back, at least!" There is no source at Bannec. The only cistern, which collects rain water... is a constant worry for the four solitary men. At daybreak, when the tide is low, Ambroise starts his gathering... at one of those thousands of reefs that make the sea so dangerous here This morning, Ambroise's arm feels weak and has none of the usual skill. Jean-Marie, on the other hand, is already back with a huge crop. The seaweed should be spread and partly dried in the sun before being burned. The harvest season only lasts 3 months. Ambroise's companion is worried... This laziness must come to an end ! The drought goes on and the water cistern sinks to an alarming level. With the evening comes some rest. "Are you mad? You use drinking water to wash your hands ?... You think you can get away with such girlish behavior here ?" As you let me down and went to work for Jean-Marie, he'll have to feed you! Feverish and helpless, Ambroise considers going back to his home at Ouessant... where there is a doctor. Ambroise gathers all his force to raise the sail with his only working arm... But the dead calm makes the trip impossible without rowing. Ouessant, which is separated from Bannec by the difficult Fromveur passage... is the biggest and mildest of the islands of the archipelago. Jean-Marie's mother would never have dared to put on her headdress again... if she had missed the daily mass but she was on very bad terms with her neighbor, Ambroise's mother. Malgorn, one of the guardians of the Menn-Tenn-Sell lighthouse... finally has his turn of ten days to spend on land "Something's strange on Bannec... Only one oven smoking the last 2 days... Today none of the boats parted." The devoted doctor Lesenn is the youngest islanders' best friend, despite his 67 years. The locals all have a deep affection for him, based on respect and gratitude. The guardian of Stiff, the lighthouse north-east of the island, agrees : "There is surely something strange going on on Bannec..." Faced with the Register of Sailors, this people consisting of widows, orphans, parents who lost their sons, is swift at reacting. The name of Bannec is whispered. Mothers, daughters, seamen's wives, the Ouessant women are fearsome.... They try to perceive Bannec "Doctor Lesenn ! Only he can do it..." "Yes, it's disquieting... When the tide allows, I'll try to get to Bannec." "Ambroise ! I found my knife ! Ambroise, we were wrong... listen !" "Pierre, we can't just sit here and watch him suffer like this... We must get him to Ouessant..." "Not saying against.. But how to traverse the Fromveur in this dead calm... With 4 men rowing we won't manage to go up the stream..." Come on children, we need yet another sailor to get to Bannec... Not a soldier, but a real sailor ! ..." The fog, most dangerous of enemies... The semaphore flag signals VARIABLE wind. At daybreak. But on the other side of the island, an old man is sick... and calling for help from the good doctor. The end.
