-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- I'm so sorry, baby, I thought we could outrun this storm. Don't worry, we got this. Mammoth tower, this is Cessna November 6398 Charlie, traveling 1-4-1 16 miles east of your position. Juliet, do you copy? That's not good; call it in. Mammoth tower, Mayday, Mayday. We've got a stalled engine, and... The radio's dead. We gotta land. Mayday! Mayday! Latitude 37.9, longitude -108. Mayday! Latitude 37.9, longitude -108! Tanya? I'm Dr. Hammond. You're in Mammoth Hospital. You were in a plane crash. Do you remember? Where... where is he? The man who was in the plane with you? He didn't survive. I'm sorry. I don't care about your wife's problem, Javier. Turn around and talk to me. When my water broke, I drove myself to the hospital. And the day after delivery, I was back at the job. So tell your wife to suck it up. And you, ha! You better get your ass to work on time or you're outta here. - Comprende? - I don't have to listen to this. Don't you walk away when I'm talking to you. I know you're drinking my decaf and I don't appreciate it. It's the one luxury I have in this life. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to flight school! My name is Tanya Jackson and I will be your tour guide through this amazing adventure. Today, I am gonna start by introducing you to some of the dials that you will find in a real cockpit. The altimeter, vertical speed, airspeed, heading, and my favorite horizontal friend at 3,000 feet, the attitude indicator. I'll let you guys take a look. Before we get started, I wanna meet everybody. Hi. What's your name? J-Jake Sherman. Hi! You must be Tanya. Jacob Mathews. Nice to meet you, Captain Mathews. Uh, call me Jake. And that was your first takeoff! Woo-hoo! Nice to meet you, Jake. Don't worry, we got this. So, Jake. What do you do? I'm operations manager at MetroTech. We make, uh, lighting fixtures for houses and office buildings. Hm. Sounds interesting. It's not, I hate it. Why do you want to learn how to fly? I've always been interested in doing it. I mean, if I can. I hear it's really tough, so I don't even know if it's possible for me. I just came by today to check it out - and see if maybe... - Jake? Yeah? It's possible. That's what I'm here for. Jake! Oh! You came back! So what'd your professor think of your outline? He liked it, but to qualify as a dissertation, I have to interview more survivors. You've already done a ton of interviews. Tell me about it; this doctorate thing never ends. You know what? Let's get away. Let's go on vacation, somewhere like Hawaii or something. Hawaii's expensive. And after they raised your tuition? We ain't got it. You're no fun! - That's my mom. - Oh man, now? She's just gonna be a minute, shh! Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Mom. Thank you for bringing these. You didn't have to wash them. It was such a great party the other night, wasn't it? Where the hell'd you go this afternoon? Hi, Margaret. So nice of you to join us. You think you can leave at 2:00 and I'm not gonna notice? Don't talk about work when we're at home, remember? We have an agreement. Yeah. But your husband also agreed he was gonna run the entire shop in six months. It's what your father wanted. I finished the inventory. Woulda been sitting around the rest of my shift. That's not the point! How'm I gonna promote you over Randy or Ted or any of the other guys if you disappear in the middle of the afternoon? Listen to me. I've got a big investors meeting in Santa Barbara next month. I've gotta be able to look them in the eye and convince them you can run it when I retire. I'm taking flying lessons. Flying lessons? You are gonna fly a plane? Don't you have to be, like, smart to do that? Mom, please! Are you staying for dinner? Should I make you a plate? Don't even bother. I'm leaving. Look. If this little airplane hobby of yours gets in the way of work, you and I are gonna have a problem. Do we have a problem, Jake? No. We don't. Good. Don't say anything. Here's $2,000. Just take it, baby, I know you need it. I'll see you later. I'll see you at work. And I really like the instructor, she's got tons of experience. Can't wait to get started. What's the matter? If we don't have money to go on vacations, how can you afford flying lessons? I checked and they're not cheap. No, they're not. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to surprise you. Look, what I really wanna do is get my own airplane. That way, we can go on vacation anytime we want, anywhere in the world. How are you gonna pay for this? And where are we supposed to keep an airplane? In the backyard? Okay, you wanna know why I didn't tell you? Because every time we talk about something that I wanna do, you shoot it down. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Do you really think you're gonna learn how to fly? Aren't you supposed to know a little bit about math and physics? I mean, no offense, babe, but you barely graduated high school. Wow. Thanks. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, you did. You're a writer, you know exactly what you mean to say. You're right. I did mean it like that. I just don't think you have the self-discipline it takes to be a pilot. If it wasn't for me literally pushing you out of bed every morning, you'd never make it to work on time. It's bad enough I have to work for your mother all day. Now I have to sleep with her too? Terrific. I can't believe you just said that to me! - Look. I'm just saying... - No! Don't touch me. That's the worst thing you can say to a woman, is that I remind you of your mother-in-law. Well, you sounded just like her right now. You can go sleep in the living room if you feel that way. - Baby, come on. - No! I'm serious. If you don't wanna sleep with me because I remind you of my mother, then go. Sleep in the living room. Cable traffic, Cessna Five Nine Two Romeo is taxiing to 2-4. Now tell him you're taking off on 2-4. Taking off on 2-4. Departure to the, uh, west. Great, that's all you gotta say. Now take your foot off the brake, pull back on the yoke, right hand on your throttle, yep. Now head right for the 2-7 sign and then you just swoop around so you have a good, clear shot of the final. Good. Okay, and nice and smooth... all the way to full power. Now, anticipate the airplane's gonna want to yaw to the left because of the torque. There you go, that's your first takeoff. Now, bring it up to 1300. Turn on your crosswind light. Now, take a left. You're gonna take your foot off the right rudder to come left. No, the right rudder to come left. No... right rudder, not the left. Not so quick on the yoke. Oh! Don't overcompensate so much, no... That's okay, that's what flight simulators are for. Ms. Jackson? Hey, Jake! Please... please call me Tanya. Tanya, um, I'm just curious. How'm I doing? Oh gosh, don't worry about today. You sure? Because if I don't have what it takes, you'll be honest with me, right? It takes practice, you know? Just... you gotta put in the time. Flight time, simulator time, lots and lots of time. Right. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Jake? What are you doing right now? Thanks for taking me up. My pleasure. Hey, you know, there's a little box of airplane parts back there. I gotta drop 'em off at a skydiving school in Palm Springs. You wanna come with me? When? Now. Now? Uh... thanks, but I should get back. I got an early day tomorrow. It's only an hour flight, we'll be back by 8:00. Oh. Duh. So is that a yes? That's a yes! So how long you been married? Your, uh, wedding ring. Oh. Right. Um, six years. You? Uh, never married. I, uh, came close, but... What happened? He... he died. In the plane crash. Oh. Right. Sorry. I read about that. Before I enrolled, I checked you out. You probably discovered that I'm an expert at what not to do. I bet your wife's excited that you're learning how to fly. Not really. She's kinda totally against it. We got into a big fight about it. That's not good. Yeah, I've been sleeping on the couch for the past week. Mm. So I have a confession to make. Actually, it's like two confessions. Okay. When you first came into my class, I couldn't take my eyes off you. Whoa. I'm sorry, does that freak you out? No, no, no, it's okay. What's the other confession? The other one is about me delivering the box of airplane parts to the skydiving school. Yeah, I don't have to. I-I made the whole thing up. Oh. I just... I wanted to spend a little more time with you. That's um... that's really... There's a hotel around the corner. You know, if you wanna just relax for a little bit. I, uh... I can't, I should get home. So you can sleep on the sofa? So I can sleep on the sofa. I've never really done this before. I can't. I'm married, I just... I'm sorry, I can't. Uh... Okay. Um, just excuse me. Mayday! Latitude 37.9... Jacob Mathews. He didn't survive. Your wife's a lucky girl. But you know, she's wrong about you flying. That she is. Let's just forget any of this ever happened. I really appreciate that. I feel, like, so guilty right now, I just... Shh, just... it's okay. Look, it's our secret, okay? Nobody has to know. And look, why don't you bring your wife to class next Thursday and I will take you both up, free of charge? Maybe if she sees you in a cockpit, she'll change her mind about you being a pilot. Really? You'd be okay with that? Yeah, of course. Annie, what are you doing next Thursday? You wanna come by class and see Jake fly next week? Oh, no, no, please don't. I have class on Thursdays until 6:00. That's too bad. Hey, Annie, check this out. Isn't it incredible? No, not really! Tanya, I don't think you should... When I'm up here, I feel like a goddess, like I have wings. Feel that Annie, huh? - Do you have wings? - No, I don't have wings! - Sure you can't fly? - Yep! I'm pretty sure. Come on, everybody can fly. It's easy. I'll teach you. What are you doing? Stop! Tanya! What the hell are you doing? Please stop! Jake! This isn't funny! Everybody can fly, it's easy. I'll teach you. You wanna sign up for flying lessons? Uh, no, I'm kinda busy with school and all. Oh. That's right, I forgot. See you next Thursday, Jake. Okay. Thanks, Tanya. That woman scares me, babe. She's fine. She's an adrenaline junkie and I'm pretty sure she has a death wish. She's an incredible pilot and she's been really good to me. Look, I need you to have my back. There's a feeling I get when I'm up there. I can't explain it, but it's like - I was born to do this. - Would you promise me you'll be careful? Unlike... I promise. Sorry for what I said last week. Me too. You're not gonna get him. He's mine. Just try to keep 80. Just set whatever pitch attitude's gonna give you 80. - Throttle back? - Nope, nope, leave the throttle right where it is. Put your hand on the trim wheel. Yep, just start trimming it back. Yeah. There you go. Now, there's a shopping mall... Oh. You see those square buildings - over there? - Yeah. Yeah. I want you to head for that mall. I'm gonna let go. Whoa! Hey, this is my neighborhood. Oh, really? Huh. Why don't you take it down to about 500 feet? - That low? - Yeah, sure, be fine. My house should be right about... there. Now, you're gaining airspeed so you're gonna gain lift, so when it gets to 100, I want you to pull the power back to 2200 RPMs. Jake? You hear me? Uh, yeah. You okay? I'm good. Hey, babe. Guess what I did today? I got my outline approved. And the professor loved it! I didn't have time to cook, so I went to Whole Foods and put a down payment on a dinner. But don't worry, I got everything that you like. Who's the guy? What guy? The guy you were kissing this afternoon. I wasn't kissing a guy this afternoon. Yeah, you were. Right out there in the driveway. - I saw you. - You saw me? What, were you taking flying lessons over the house or something? Well, you have our house mistaken for somebody else's because I was at school this afternoon. I kinda know what our house looks like. I saw you kiss him, and then you took him in here and you had sex with him, didn't you? Didn't you hear me? I wasn't here this afternoon, I was at school! You can ask my professor. Why don't you just admit it? You're not attracted to me anymore. - What? - You haven't wanted to have sex with me for the past three years. - That's not true. - Yes it is. You know it is. Look, if you wanna date other people, - just tell me. - What? No! Babe, I don't wanna date anybody else. Look, whatever it is you think you saw at 30,000 feet, - it wasn't me. - You don't go up - to an altitude that high. - Okay, whatever, you have me mistaken for somebody else. Do you need your space again? That's what this is, isn't it? No! Babe, look, you're starting to worry me. I didn't do anything. Okay. Fine. You're not gonna admit it. I'll tell you what. We need to take a little break. What? Where is this coming from? Until you figure out what you wanna do, I'm gonna go stay at Tom's place for a while. No! Look, this is insane. Could you just slow down and talk to me, please? Babe! Babe, will you knock this off? Look, will you just stop? I didn't do anything, you have this all wrong! - Babe! - Don't text me, don't call me. You can sleep in the living room if you feel that way. Now, we can't fix a broken heart, but with a little tape and glue, you can fix about anything else. Say you crash land in the middle of nowhere and injuries are more than just scrapes and bruises, right? Well... Scalpels, splints, chloroform, tracheostomy kit, battery-powered defib, you name it. Now, we have an EMT seminar that covers everything in this kit, but do you guys have any questions? Okay, all right, well, great day, everybody. I'll see you guys next week. - Thanks, Tanya. - Bye, Ms. Jackson. Hey. How you doing? I'm okay. Really? You don't seem okay. What's going on? Remember when we flew over my house last week? Yeah. Well, I saw Annie with another guy. - Oh. - So I moved out. We're taking a little break. I'm, um... I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. She's just... I don't know. Six years, I mean, she's getting bored with me, I guess. - Mm. - Anyway, it is what it is. Well, does that mean that your flight instructor can ask you what you're doing tonight? Um... I can't. Why not? You're not with her anymore, so... It's just a little soon. Come on, do you not like me? I know you like me, Jake. It's too soon. - Sorry. - Yeah. It's okay. Bye. Hey, handsome. You wanna be a pilot? Um... yeah. Who are you? I'm Penelope. This is my friend Betty. - What's your name? - Jake. Hi, Jake. We fly with Captain Gonzo Rogers. - Have you heard of him? - Yeah, the, uh, stunt pilot? Yeah, he runs a flight school out of Santa Monica Airport. His students fly for the best airlines. Blue Angels, Thunderbirds, you name it. - Whoa. - We're actually having an open campus at the hangar this weekend. You should come by and say hi. Betty and I will be there. The address and time are on the back. Thanks, ladies. Bye! - Thank you, goodbye. - We're just talking to... No, you're trying to steal my students, I know who you are and who you work for. - , girl, relax. - Okay, just tell Gonzo this is really uncool, okay? I don't go down to Santa Monica and poach his students, do I? Get lost. Jesus, what'd they give you? Oh my God, this guy spends a fortune on marketing. - You know him? - We used to race together. Typical macho knucklehead. Believe me, you don't wanna learn from this guy. It's the shop, they've been blowing up my phone all day. I gotta get back. Okay, well maybe this weekend I'll see... What's the problem? Jake! You made it. - Hey, yeah. - Let me introduce you to the captain. - Captain Rogers? - Excuse me. - This is Jake Sherman. - Jake. Glad to meet you. Penelope tells me great things. So you wanna be a pilot, yeah? Yeah, I'm, you know, thinking about it. Oh, come on. You're doing more than thinking about it, you're taking lessons already, right? Yeah, with, uh, Tanya Jackson, do you know her? Of course. She's terrific. Tough as nails, that woman. What's she been through, hello? She and an old pilot buddy of mine... And his name was Jake too... They took a nosedive into the Rockies, bam! My friend dies, Tanya gets medevacked out, spends a whole month in ICU drooling all over herself. Dude, I'm surprised they renewed her pilot's license, frankly. But yeah, she's one of the best. I've learned a lot - from her so far. - Jake. Where's the money at in air travel? I mean, where's it headed? Commercial passenger and freight. FedEx, UPS, Amazon. Look. I'll get right to the point. Tanya's great if you wanna learn how to fly the little crop dusters on the weekends. You know, take the family to the Grand Canyon, that sort of thing. But if you wanna learn to fly the big birds for major airlines, if you wanna jockey the F-18s at the speed of sound... - You feel me, yeah? - Yeah. If you wanna be Top Gun material, this is where it's happening. Got it. Penelope, show him the simulator. - Absolutely. - Classes start Sunday at 01200. See you on the flight line, amigo. Gonzo Rogers. Nice to meet you. Hi, Tanya. How you doing? Hey. I'm, uh, okay. - Where are you? - At my friend's place, in his spare room. Oh, I hope I'm not calling too late. No, that's okay. He's never around. What's up? Nothing, I'm just lying here thinking about you. You were? Yeah, well, ever since Palm Springs, I've been thinking about you a lot. Mm, you have? I know I probably shouldn't be saying this, but, I don't know, after going through the crash and all, if there's one thing I learned, it's that life is short, and if you have feelings for somebody, you should tell them. You're... you're right about that. Hm. Um, what are you doing tomorrow? I have the day off. You wanna go see a movie? - I can't. - Oh. Why not? Tanya, I went to the open campus down at Gonzo's hangar. - You did? - Yeah, um... I'm gonna start taking lessons with him. - Really? - I... I think it'll be good for me, and Sunday at noon, he's doing a solo stunt demonstration for all the new students, and I really wanna be there. - I see. - I can't afford to take flying lessons at two places, so... I'm gonna have to drop your class. - You understand, right? - No, Jake... he's not safe, you don't understand. I've known the guy for years, I can't tell you how many times he's come this close - to buying the farm. - Well, I checked his record, - he's never crashed. - Oh... and I have, is that what you mean? I didn't say that. Please, don't take this personally. How can I not? I'm... Jake, please be honest. Am I... am I coming on too strong? No. Not at all. Because I have this tendency to be a little aggressive in situations like this, and I just... I don't wanna scare you away. Look, you're a great instructor and you've taught me so much, but I'm... I'm gonna do this. I'm really sorry. Well, we... we can still hang out, right? You and me? Even though I'm not your instructor. I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, if I'm studying with somebody else, you know, it could get awkward. - I, uh, I get it. - I'll... I'll check in. Let you know how it's going. Okay! Goodnight. So, where's Jake this morning? Um, you remember his friend Tom? Yeah. Guy who lives around the corner. Yeah. Um, Jake's staying at his place. What do you mean, he's staying at his place? Why? What's that look? I know that look. What's going on? We're separated. When did this happen? About a week and a half ago. He thinks I'm cheating on him. I try calling him but he doesn't answer. I don't know what else to do. That son of a bitch. I knew he was a mistake. Oh, honey, why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want you to worry. Worry? I'm your mother and I'm his employer. I don't believe him. He's been coming to work every day just keeping this secret from me. - I'm gonna fire his ass. - No, Mom, don't! We need the money. I've gotta drive to Santa Barbara next week and meet with the investors. How'm I gonna sell them on Jake if you are getting a divorce? No, we're not getting a divorce. Jake and I will work this out, I promise. I love him and I don't wanna lose him over this. I told you not to marry him. Did you listen? No. Please. Don't say anything to him. You're my baby. And this jerkwad thinks he can just break your heart and walk out on you? Oh, honey. Don't you see what he's doing? He's the one cheating. He's having the affair. That's why he's accusing you of having one. I'm gonna get him on the phone. Forget that, he'll never answer. Uh, he's at Tom's? I know where that is, I'm gonna drive over there. - No, don't you dare. - Someone's gotta pound some sense into this moron. No, I just wanted to talk to you, okay? I don't want you in the middle of this. Please. All right. All right, Annie. Please don't mention this to him. I won't. I promise. Oh boy. What the hell's the matter with you? Sorry, Margaret, can't talk right now. Oh, you're gonna talk to me, dammit. Hey! How dare you accuse my daughter of having an affair, you bastard. Open this door! Don't you drive away while I'm talking to you. Jake! I am your boss. If you don't get back here right now and talk to me, I'm gonna... Damn him. Looks great. All right. Make sure to get the full deposit from everyone today, all right? I know. I heard you the first 100 times. Tanya Jackson. The hell are you doing down here? Hm. I dunno. Thought I'd talk to some of your students, see if they wanted to drop your class, train with me. Don't mind, do you, Gonzo? Don't mind at all. Hey, what are you teaching these days? Crash landings? Oh... I'm gonna do a little stunt demo in a minute. Maybe you should stick around, learn how it's done. I'd love to. All right, what a good-looking bunch! Ladies and gentlemen, come on in. Welcome to Flight Academy. Yeah! Please allow me to introduce an old friend of mine. She's an amazing pilot, and we used to compete against each other at the Reno Air Races. Give it up for Ms. Tanya Jackson. Before we start the first lesson, I thought I'd do a little stunt demo for you guys. How's that sound? Yeah. Now, I don't normally do this, but it's the first day, so why not? Who wants to go for a ride? Um, Captain... Uh, how 'bout you, young man? - What's your name again? - Jake. All right, Jake. Uh, no. I don't think that's a good idea. Really. Why is that? Because I... I have seen your routine, Captain Rogers, and you're one hell of a wild man up there. You got that right, babycakes. - Let's do it. - No, I'm... I'm serious. You wanna do stunts, do 'em by yourself. You've got no business putting your students at risk. Spoken from the bully pulpit of someone who crashed her plane and killed her copilot, Captain Jacob Mathews, one of the best there ever was. Can't be a lecture on flight safety from the likes of you. Come on. Jake! Don't get on that plane. I'll be okay. Jake! Oh boy. That's my mother-in-law. You should probably take somebody else. Captain, Tanya's right. You can't do stunts with the students. We're not insured for it. Fine. Sorry, folks! No passengers this time. Watch and learn, Miss Crash-and-Burn. It's Sunday. This is not interfering with work. Well, I thought you said you weren't gonna do this anymore. I'm gonna go watch the demo. Flight safety. Tanya, gimme a break. In front of the students, come on. Woo-hoo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha! Excuse me. You are breaking Annie's heart, do you realize that? She's got a new boyfriend. - She's fine. - No she doesn't. She told me she's not seeing anybody. God, I love bein' me. Woo! Look, I'm not gonna have this conversation with you right now. And what goes on with me and Annie is none of your business. Yes it is my business. She's my daughter, and I'm not gonna let you destroy her marriage. It's my marriage too, last I checked. Don't get smart with me. What's going on? C'mon, baby. I know exactly what you're doing. - What am I doing? - You're accusing my daughter of having an affair to cover up the fact that you're having one. Who is it? Is it her? - Is he sleeping with you? - Margaret, stop. I don't like you very much, Jake, you wanna know why? - Oh, do tell. - Because you've got the mental capacity of a doughnut. But for some reason, my daughter's in love with you. I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand back and watch you ruin her life. Gah! Come on, Gonzo. Come on, Gonzo! Well. You're gonna wipe that ADD grin off your face, go home, apologize to Annie, and fix your marriage right now. And forget all this airplane flying nonsense. Do you hear me? Holy crap! You wanna take flying lessons from this guy? Oh, honey, you're gonna get yourself killed. No! Ma'am... I can assure you. Statistically, flying is a lot safer than driving a car. Here at Captain Rogers' Flight Academy... safety is our number one priority. Excuse me, I'm looking for Jake. Oh. Thanks. Hey. Hey! Can I get a hug? Mm. I haven't heard from you in a while. - How you been? - All right, just... been working. I, um, I heard they shut down Gonzo's school. Yeah. I guess you were right about him. Are... are you and Annie back together? I'm still staying at my friend's place. You... you wanna go grab a coffee? I can't. But, um, come here. I was hoping you'd call me to sign up for private lessons. Mango, pineapple, or mandarin? Uh... pineapple? I wanted to, but after what happened with Gonzo, my mother-in-law freaked. Oh, yeah, I saw. No, it got worse when Annie found out. I can't fly anymore. What do you mean? You have to fly. I mean, it doesn't matter what anybody says. Flying's what you were born to do, am I right? No, I think 20 percent discount's more fair. Well, there's no way I'm gonna pay for your full price when your deliveries are late. Okay, listen. I'll teach you after work or on your day off, no charge. It won't cost anything but time and nobody has to know. - You'd do that? - Yeah, and I will behave myself. There... there won't be another Palm Springs. Unless, of course, it's your idea. Tanya... Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, okay, yeah, I'll get back to you as soon as I know. Hi. - Hi. - Um, Margaret, this is my friend Tanya. Tanya, this is my mother-in-law Margaret. Have we met? No, I don't think so. So, um... I'll, uh, I'll see you later. Okay. Thanks for coming by. Is that your girlfriend? Hey, I'm talking to you. No, she's not my girlfriend. - I don't believe you. - Believe what you want. The only reason I haven't fired you yet is because Annie begged me not to. - Tanya Jackson. - Yeah? Margaret! Hello again. How did you find me? I recognized you from that plane crash demonstration. Found your picture online. Oh, uh... what can I do for you? You could stay away from my son-in-law. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Oh, I think you do. He's married. He works for me. He doesn't have time to go running around town pretending he's some sort of pilot. Okay, I told Jake that I could train him after his work hours, if that helps. Oh, I'm sure you'd love to go flying late at night with him. With all due respect, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Jake. I find that hard to believe. Look, I'm gonna make this simple for you, sweetie. Either you stay away from my son-in-law or I'm gonna tell the people that run this place that you sleep with your students. See how they like that. No more innocent visits to his place of employment, and no more flying lessons, and if he tries to enroll in this school, you just reject his application. Okay, yeah, I'm not gonna argue with you. Good. But you know why I care about Jake? Actually, I am not the least bit interested! He was born to be a pilot. He is good at it and he loves it. - Really, is that so? - And when I meet someone who has that kind of talent for flying, which is my entire life's work... Okay, I didn't come here for chit-chat. You and I have an understanding, that's it. I gotta go, I got a long drive ahead of me. - Where are you headed? - What do you care? I... I don't know, maybe I can give you a ride. - What, in that thing? - Yeah, where are you going? Santa Barbara. Okay, I can get you there in 30 minutes, save you a two-hour drive. Huh. How much? Usually it's $200 an hour, but for a member of Jake's family, it's on the house. - Really? - Yeah. Consider it a peace offering. I'm a businesswoman, Ms. Jackson, and I know a good deal when I see one. And see, here, I'm adjusting the trim, which is really just like a poor man's autopilot. Kind of makes the flight smooth or not smooth. That's... that's it. The rest is pretty straightforward. Okay, that's a lot to remember. Jake could never memorize all that. Jake's actually a really good pilot. Jake? Please. He's three tacos short of a combo plate. Can I ask you a question? Why do you have such a low opinion of your son-in-law? Because he's an idiot. He's lazy, unmotivated. My daughter's beautiful. She's incredible, and she could've had any man she wanted, doctor, lawyer, anybody. Instead she falls for this worthless jerk, this Jake fricking Sherman. I wanted so much more for her. I worked my whole life, built up a business alongside her dad, for what? To leave it to her and this... this Jake? This loser? And if you think that that bed stain masquerading as my son-in-law has the chops to be a pilot, you're not only deluding yourself, you're as stupid as he is. No wonder you crashed your plane. What the hell are you doing? Oh, God, no! - Hello? - Hi, am I speaking with Annie Sherman? - Uh, yes, who is this? - This is the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. Just confirming, your mother is Margaret Harris, correct? - Uh, what happened? - I'm sorry to tell you this, but your mother passed away tonight at roughly 8:38 p.m. What? How? It looks like she committed suicide. Her body was found at the base of the Palm Vista Bank building in downtown Los Angeles. What do you mean, she committed suicide? That's what the police are telling us. Apparently a lot of people jump off this building. I'm sorry. Her car was parked a few blocks away, keys in the ignition. We're assuming you want to retrieve the vehicle, correct? Ms. Sherman, are you there? Dear family and friends, we gather today to celebrate the life of Margaret Harris, beloved wife, mother, and friend to the community. Her time on Earth was a blessing to us all, and she will be missed. It doesn't make sense. I mean, she had her problems, but... she wasn't depressed. - She was miserable. - Don't say that. - She wasn't miserable. - She was. She was mean to everybody. Me, people at the shop. The only person she was ever nice to was you. What about the business? I mean, you and I own it now, and somebody needs to be there to run it full time. I say we sell it. I don't know about that, it's a money-maker. Do you want to make lighting fixtures for the rest of your life? - No. - Well, I've done it for the past year and I'm not doing it anymore. We're gonna sell the place, and I'm gonna fly airplanes. What's gotten into you? You never used to talk like this. Is that a problem? I kinda like it. I miss you. I didn't do what you said I did. Can we not talk about this, please? I just want you to come back home. Yeah, but you can't go back to her. She's a mess, I have to. No, you don't. Come on, man. - She's playing you. - What do you mean? You told me she's not attracted to you anymore. That's, you know, part of being in a long-term relationship. She cheated on you, and you saw her, right? It was a one-time thing, and she swears she didn't do it, so I don't really even know if what I saw was her or if it could've been... - What about her mom? - What about her? Well, when Margaret would treat you like dirt, did Annie ever defend you or tell her mom to shut the hell up? No! In fact, Annie agreed with her. You told me she did. Yeah, well, she's made some mistakes. Will you stop making excuses for her? Give yourself some credit. I don't know if it's all the years of abuse that you've endured from your mother-in-law or what, but, I mean, you've no idea how wonderful you are. You know, you work hard, you're always trying to do right by other people. You're handsome. And you're one hell of a pilot. God, I know this is gonna sound really silly, but... You remind me of what life was like before the crash. Annie doesn't know what she needs. But I know I need you. I married her. I made a commitment, and I can't just quit at the first sign of trouble. I still want to take flying lessons with you, but I'm gonna go back to my wife. - It's the right thing to do. - It wasn't a one-time thing. What? She's still cheating on you. I took some aerial photos. I know that I shouldn't have, but I was worried about you, so. That's your backyard, right? Right. And that's Annie. When did you take these? Last week. She likes getting massaged under the sun. And she... likes to do... other things... under the sun as well. I'm sorry. You wanna go fly an airplane? Yeah. Okay, give me a 45-degree turn to the right. And remember, turn to the right while you're descending, there's no... No rudder on the turns, only to initiate the turns. Good, exactly. Why? Because when you do that, it offsets adverse yaw. Yeah, you're doin' great! You're not just sayin' that? No, I'm not just sayin' that! Come on, you're a pilot, man. You're doin' it. Careful. Uh... what are you doin'? I'm maybe... giving you... a chance... at revenge. Um, I don't think you should... Houston, we have a problem. After you sell the business, what are you gonna do? Think I'm gonna buy an airplane. I saw an ad online for a 1947 Cessna. - Price of a used car. - Really? I was thinking about going back to Mexico. We could borrow my friend's Gulfstream. Baja. Mexico City. Cozumel. Cool. - We should do it. - We will. No, I mean... now. Like, tomorrow. Are you serious? Yeah! Okay, why not? Really, you will? Hi, Annie, how ya doin'? Hey, Lindsey. Wait, where are you? I'm at the mall, I'm not home. I'm looking at you through my doorbell camera. - Do you see it there? - Oh, I didn't even notice. That's the whole point. I kept getting packages stolen off my porch, so I figured I'd get one of these. Very cool. I am so sorry about your mom. How are you holding up? Oh, I'm... I'm okay. Hey, listen, I, um, I got a letter addressed to you in my mailbox. The mail lady must've made a mistake. Oh, just put it in the mailbox. I'll be home in 30 minutes. I'll grab it then. Thanks, hon, I really appreciate it. No problem. What's up? Hey, Lindsey, sorry to bother you again, um... I have a favor to ask. So, you're in luck. My husband is amazing with computers and cameras. He disabled the motion sensor, so it sees everything all the time. I don't understand. It's not important. Good news is, this video's been recording for, I don't know, a month, longer? Oh, okay, cool. So whatever you're looking for, it should be on there. - I gotta run. - Okay, thank you. I will bring it to you when I'm done, okay? Call me, let me know what you find. I am so curious. This is, like, one of those detective shows. CSI, whatever, I love those! Thank you again, I'll see you soon. Okay. Um, yeah, uh, is that your car? Yeah. Something wrong? You were in my driveway a couple weeks ago, weren't you? I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Annie. Look, um, this is my house and this is your car, and I'm pretty sure that's you with some guy. Who are you and what were you doing there? Oh, man, they didn't get permission, did they? - Who's they? - You know, the photographers. Oh, I knew something was fishy when they paid me in cash. What? What are you talking about? Look, I'm just the model. If you wanna get mad about them shooting on your property, you'll have to talk to the cops. No, wait, look. My husband saw you and he thought you were me. He left me because he thought I was kissing some guy. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. Please? Please! A few weeks ago, I submitted my pictures for this modeling gig. They called me in and... I mean, it was a little weird because it was just me and this producer. Um, nice lady. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you too. Here. You brought some photos? So did you get a name? Um, Susan, I think? Suzette? Anyway, um, they said that they just needed a shot of a girl and a guy making out next to a car wearing this hat and some clothes that they gave me. Anyway, it was a one-day gig and they paid me in cash. So I did it. - So why my house? - I don't know. They just gave me that address and said, "Go there, kiss this guy." About a week later, they asked us to do it again, but this time it was in the backyard and it was a little sexier. Lots of coconut oil. Like, it got in my hair, it was... - Just so weird. - Why? I mean, I watched hours of video footage from my neighbor's doorbell camera, and I never saw any photographers or camera crew, nothing. Oh, it's because they weren't shooting us from the ground. They were shooting us from an airplane. An airplane? The audition was at a flight school, so my guess is it was just some promotional thing. See, this is why I need an agent, because there are just so many creeps out there with cameras who think they can just take advantage of people like me. All right, we'll be ready to go in a couple minutes. So I'm just gonna throw some stuff in a suitcase, grab my passport, and then we can go. Oh, um, actually, I, uh... I have a couple of errands I have to run first. - I'll come with you. - No, no, no, that's all right. Um... how about I meet you at the airport? Say, uh... three? All right, whatever. Okay, yeah. Jake? Jake? Jake? Tanya! Hey! Oh... Hi, what... what are you doing here? What do you mean? We're leaving at three, right? Well, yeah, but it's only noon. You're... you're early. I know, I thought I'd check out the Gulfstream, you know, surprise you. Maybe we could take off a little bit before three. Yeah, no, I'd love to, but I... I, uh, I gotta make a drop first. Yeah, that's cool, I'll come with you. I mean, I'm packed, you're packed, right? Yeah, yeah, sure, okay, why not? Exactly! Why not? Uh, what's in the... the box? It's just, uh... The main office asked me to make a delivery on the way to town, so I figured I'd put it in the Gulfstream. Come on, now, tell me the truth. - I am. - No, you're not. You're lying to me, aren't you? Why do you think I'm lying to you? Because you said the same thing when we went to Palm Springs! Remember? You said you had to make a delivery. Right, okay, yeah, well, I'm telling the truth this time. I mean, I'd never know with you, right? Right. - Here let me help you. - No, no, it's okay. No, no, really, I got it, I got it. So, tell me, what's in the box anyway? It's, um... Fish food. Fish food? Yeah. Pellets. They're these... little tracking devices. Marine biologists at UCLA ask us to drop 'em every six months or so, and then dolphins and whales eat 'em and they can track their migration patterns. Wow, I, uh... never heard of that. - Can I see what they look like? - No, no! You... you can't open the box. Why not? Because they smell and they're greasy, and, you know, it's my buddy's plane, so I gotta keep it clean for him. So, you're just gonna... dump that box into the ocean? Yeah. You, uh, wanna help me? Uh... sure. Okay, great. I'm just gonna bring her down a bit and reduce speed. Okay, we're good to go. Go ahead, open the door. Wow! Yeah, it's incredible, right? Go ahead, push it out the door. Okay. Damn, girl, it's heavy! Yeah, well, you know, those fish are hungry. - Especially the sharks. - Really? A lot of sharks in the area? - Yeah, hundreds of 'em. - No kidding! Yeah, and I hear they love a free meal. You're probably right about that! Go ahead, push it out! Hurry, I can't maintain this altitude for long. Okay. Hey, what's the matter? This box, is it biodegradable? I... I don't know. Well, you know how I feel about people who litter, right? I mean... why don't I just open the box and dump out the pellets? It's okay, just... just push out the damn box. We do it all the time. Are you sure? Jake! Jake! Yes, I'm sure! It's... it's cool, baby. Go ahead, just... just push it out. Okay! On three, ready? One... Two... Three! Jake! What the hell? Jake! Help me! Annie? Yes, it's me! Get me out of here! Oh my God. - Baby, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay, I think. Where are we? What the hell have you done? Autopilot on. Okay, no, Jake. Jake, Jake, please, please don't be mad. - Where's the key to this? - I threw it away. Listen, listen, she doesn't love you. She thinks you're too stupid to be a pilot. You told me she said that. She's just like her mother. She needs to go away, just like her mother. Holy crap, you killed Margaret? No, no, I liberated you from Margaret! Come on, don't you see? You're so much happier now. You don't have to work at that terrible job anymore. You're gonna be a pilot. You're gonna inherit a ton of money. You can live the life that you've always wanted to. Oh my God, I'm so much better for you than she is. She's just a dead weight in your life. Come on, let's just push this box out the door. Okay, then we'll forget that any of this ever happened. Okay? You and I will be together. It'll be all right. We're gonna be okay. Ow! What are you doing? Calling the cops. No, no! Autopilot off. I'm sorry. You wanna go back to your wife, huh? Fine! You can both die in a ball of fire! Autopilot on. Autopilot off. Jake! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Baby, baby, wake up! Jake, please! Oh, God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Babe, babe, please wake up. You've gotta fly the plane. You've gotta fly the plane, please! Okay, um... Okay. Okay. No, no, not that way! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Jake! Jake, wake up! Please! Please! No! No, no, no! Come here, come here, babe. You okay? Yeah. - There she is. - Mayday, mayday. Gulfstream November Seven Seven Five Romeo. Requesting any available law enforcement in the area. Do you copy? Coming around. Are you even certified to fly this plane? No, but I had a really good teacher. She's running away, you gotta stop her! Hang on, I'm gonna knock her down with engine thrust. I think you got her. Seven, eight, nine, that's 15,000. Here are the keys. She's beautiful, man. Yeah, have fun with her, and fly safe. It's so exciting. Hey, do me a favor, would ya? Sure, what? Be good to her. She was my dad's, and before that, she was my grandpa's. We moved around a lot when we were kids, so... this is kinda like a family home. Anyway... end of an era, right? Babe... Hey, wait a minute. I'll tell you what. You got my number. Any time you wanna take her up, let me know. For real? Cool. That's really cool of you. Thanks. So, should we take her up? Wait, um, before we take off, there's something you need to know. What is it? A couple weeks back when we weren't... you know, living together, I um... What? I slept with Tanya. I mean, she made me think you were having an affair. You know that. I feel terrible. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? I forgive you. Actually, um, there's something I need to tell you too. Uh, well, when you were gone, I... I told you about my professor, right? What about him? Uh... Never mind, it's not important. Wait, what?
