[DOG BARKING] [CAWING] HOW DO YOU DO? FATHER GAYNOR. EVENING, MRS.McKENNA. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE HERE. THANK YOU. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, DANNY. WHEN MY HUSBAND DIED, I WAS THE SAME. [MURMURING] I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES, SERGEANT. SHE WAS A LOVELY WOMAN. YES, SHE WAS, LASS. THANK YOU, MARY. Man: IT'S A GRAND WAKE, SERGEANT. THANK YOU. SOAP. LEAVE IT ALONE. LEAVE MAMMY ALONE. THIS WAS YOUR GRANNY'S. DO YOU WANT THE UNDERTAKER TO GET IT? IT BELONGS IN OUR FAMILY. QUICK, DAD, AUNTIE ROSE AND UNCLE BEN ARE TAKING MAMMY'S WEDDING RING. THAT'S IRELAND FOR YOU. THE RELATIVES TURN UP TO ROB THE CORPSE. SUCH A TRAGEDY. POOR EILEEN. YOUR MUTUAL LOVE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ALL. AT LEAST HER END, WHEN IT CAME, WAS SWIFT. WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COPE, THE TWO OF YOU? WELL, DANNY WILL HAVE TO RUN THE HOUSE LEARN TO COOK. THAT'S THE POSITION. I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE. YOU SINGE IT NOW. THAT'S THE WAY MUM DOES IT. DID IT. AAH! YOU BUGGER! UHH! WHAT'S FOR PUDDIN'? GET IT YOURSELF. HOW LONG YOU THINK I'M GONNA HANG AROUND HERE SERVING UP YOUR FOOD, WEARING THIS APRON? I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT'S A PITY, 'CAUSE IT SUITS YOU. I'M ONLY JOKING. DON'T FLY OFF THE HANDLE. ANYWAY, I COULD ALWAYS EAT AT THE WIDOW McGINN'S. SHE'S ALREADY OFFERED. CAN'T I EAT THERE AS WELL? NO. SHE ONLY HAS THE 2 CHAIRS. NO GOOD DOWN. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR IT TO GO. IF YOUR EXAM RESULTS ARE GOOD, WE'LL THINK AGAIN. TOO UNHAPPY TO THINK AT ALL. I'M GOING TO SIT TIGHT FOR NOW. NO PROBLEM, THEN. STAY HERE AND LEARN THE COOKING ROPES. AND TOMORROW, TRY AND MAKE THE STEW EDIBLE, OR WE'LL SOON HAVE ULCERS THE SIZE OF FOOTBALLS. MAYBE YOU'LL MEET ANOTHER WOMAN. LIFE CAN GO ON AS IF MUM NEVER LIVED. SHE WAS THE BEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD. EVERYTHING A WIFE AND MOTHER OUGHT TO BE. VERY FIRST DATE WE HAD, WE WENT TO A SHOW. A FELLOW ON A MANDOLIN PLAYED THE TENNESSEE WALTZ. SHE WAS WEARING A GREEN BLOUSE. DIDN'T I SEE IT LAST NIGHT IN THE WARDROBE? MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON HER GENTLE SOUL. EVERYTHING I GOT, I HAD TO DO IT MYSELF... AND MUM, OF COURSE, NO ONE EVER GAVE-- GAVE YOU A PENNY! EVERYTHING YOU GOT YOU'VE EARNED THE HARD WAY. DON'T TELL ME-- DON'T BLOODY WELL TELL ME WHAT I THINK. AND IF I CAME HOME WITH 10 OTHER WOMEN, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. MUM'S DEAD, OK? HUH? DO THE PAIR OF US HAVE TO JUMP DOWN INTO THE GRAVE AFTER HER? IT'S THE LIVING WHO HAVE TO RESURRECT THEMSELVES, AND NOT THE DEAD! NOW WHO'S FLYING OFF THE HANDLE? [COW MOOS] THAT'S THE GIRL. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME ON. THROUGH YOU GO. THAT'S IT. COME ON.

COME ON! I'D SAY, NOW, YOU ARE STILL A VIRGIN. FOR GOD SAKE, PRUNTY. MY MOTHER'S ONLY JUST BURIED. I JUST WALKED OUT ON ME FATHER. SEX IS THE LAST THING ON ME MIND. THIS BULLOCK HERE MAY BELIEVE YOU. I DON'T. WELL, TO BE HONEST, SEX IS, IN FACT, MOST OF THE TIME THE ONLY THING ON ME MIND. HA HA! I KNEW RIGHTLY. GO ON! TELL US WHAT, DANNY. YOU PULL YOUR DANGLER IN BED. LEAVE OFF, COCO. NO, I DON'T. YOU'RE A LIAR. I DARE YOU SHOUT "VAGINA" OUT LOUD. GO ON. VAGINA. ARE YOU MAD? WHY SHOULD I? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

HE CAN SLEEP IN ALONG WITH ME, OR IN THE ARM CHAIR, THERE. I REALIZE I COULD BE SOME PART OF A BURDEN, MRS. PRUNTY, BUT I APPEAL TO YOU, TO YOUR MATERNAL INSTINCTS, I NEED SANCTUARY. ALL RIGHT, SON. YOU CAN STAY. YOU GOT A LETTER FROM THE TAX MAN. WARM IT IN THE FIRE, THERE. WHAT ARE THOSE? SPORES, FOR THE GAME COCKS. THOUGHT THAT WAS ILLEGAL? EVERYTHING ALONG OUR BORDER IS ILLEGAL... INCLUDING WOMEN. SO, BE CAREFUL, LAD, I'M WARNING YOU. HERE. CLOVES, TAKE ONE. THEY'RE MAGIC. IF A WOMAN LIKES THE SMELL OF YOU, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT JUST LOOKS. WITH ANIMALS AND WOMEN, IT'S THE SMELL THAT COUNTS. I'M VERY HIGHLY SEXED. DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT? WHEN THE WOMEN SEE ME COMING, THEY RUN. I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M GOING OUT WITH A WIDDY WOMAN, THE HUSBAND'S SAFELY DEAD. THERE'S NO FEAR OF GETTING YOUR DANGLER TARRED AND FEATHERED. IT'S A KNOWN FACT, AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE BIGGER MOUTHS AND BIGGER TITS THAN WOMEN ELSEWHERE. IT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING, LAD. [MUSIC PLAYING] Woman: AND DON'T BE BENDING YOUR KNEES. AH, YOU'RE FINE.

A FARMER CAME TO HAVE HIS SOW BLESSED, AND, UH, MY SON BLESSED IT. AND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT, SERGEANT? ARE YOU MAD ENTIRELY, WOMAN? IT'S A SACRILEGE. ON THE WAY HOME, THE PIG WAS KILLED BY ME IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT. OH, NO. WAS IT INSURED, FATHER? WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT? OH, GOD PROTECT ME FROM THE STUPIDITY OF BRAINLESS WOMEN. YOUR SON'S VAN WAS SEEN BEING DRIVEN AWAY BY ME. YOU WERE DRIVING MY SON'S VAN? AH, SWEET GOD! ALL RIGHT, FATHER, ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN, MAN. MRS. PRUNTY, WHERE'S YOUR SON?

HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS OWN MIND. HE'S A DREAMER IS DANNY, BUT DREAMS DON'T PAY THE RENT. I'M SORRY, SERGEANT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTIN' AT. HE'S GOT HIS EDUCATION TO COMPLETE, AND HIS MOTHER ALWAYS WANTED HIM TO GO TO AMERICA TO BECOME SOMEONE. I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING FOR HIM AROUND HERE. WHEN I GOT MARRIED, I HAD A JOB AND A SALARY. NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY? WHOEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT GETTIN' MARRIED? SO, YOU'RE JUST STRINGIN' HIM ALONG, THEN. NO, I'M NOT. DO YOU LOVE HIM? OF COURSE I DO. I SEE.

THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO ME. WOULD YOUR FATHER MAYBE-- MY FATHER? GIVE ME MONEY FOR AN ABORTION? HE'S TO THE RIGHT OF GENGHIS KHAN. MY GOD. I FEEL LIKE JUMPIN' IN THE LAKE. IS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT BY "DYIN' FOR ME"? NO. I'M SORRY. ARE YOU SURE ABORTION IS THE ANSWER? WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER? UGH. YA LUG! YA BIG LUG! YA GREAT BIG DOUBLE-BARRELED THUNDERIN' JACKASS.

THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT. THE 100 POUNDS MOM GAVE ME... I WANT IT. DON'T YOU INSULT THE DEAD AS WELL AS THE UNBORN. I'M SO SCARED. THE BIG THINGS YOU NEVER KNOW ABOUT. THEY HAPPEN UNDER THE SURFACE.

THAT'S A NEGATIVE ON THAT. NEGATIVE. SIR! STAND BACK! SERGEANT? HE'S MY SON. BUTTER IS A GREAT MAN TO GET THE TAR OFF. YOUR DADDY'S SO PLEASED YOU'RE SAFE. WHY DID THEY DO IT TO ME, MRS. McGINN? YOU'RE LUCKY THEY DIDN'T DO WORSE. SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT LADY... YOUR MOTHER. NO ONE COULD REPLACE HER, COULD THEY, DANNY? IF SHE WAS ALIVE, WHAT WOULD SHE ADVISE? COME UP SMILING, CARRY ON. YOU'VE GOT A KIND HEART, DANNY. IT'LL BE EVEN KINDER FROM NOW ON. YOU'LL KNOW PAIN WHEN YOU SEE IT IN OTHERS. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? WITH ME HANDS AS USUAL. WHEN I'VE FINISHED WITH THEM, THEY'LL BE SORRY THEY TOUCHED YOU. AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. I'VE ALREADY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHORITIES. FORGET IT. THERE'S NO POINT. LEAVE THEM ALONE. IT'S OVER. TARRED AND FEATHERED. YOU'LL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AROUND HERE. I CAN'T WAIT TO LEAVE THE PLACE. GOOD. GRAND CROP THIS YEAR. THE BEST EVER.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT TILL I GOT MARRIED. WE CARED FOR EACH OTHER... BUT... UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW? DEEP DOWN... UNIVERSITY? YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE AS PLEASED AS PUNCH. SO AM I. THE THING THAT HURTS THE MOST... IS ANNAGH NOT WANTING THE BABY... EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE. BUT NEITHER OF YOU WANTED IT THE WAY THAT... YOUR MOM AND I WANTED YOU. THE £100 YOUR MOTHER GAVE YOU. BYE, NOW. ALL FINISHED FOR TODAY. AND DON'T GO INTO THE KITCHEN WITH MUDDY BOOTS, BARNARD. SEE YOU TOMORROW. AM I AN IDJIT FOR LETTING MYSELF GET INVOLVED WITH HER? YOU'RE ASKING ME?
