[water drizzling] [keys clanking] [sinister music] [deep breath] Jorio Comanche? [man] Yes, that's my name. An Ishvalan? [dramatic music] You alchemists deserve death. You've strayed from God. I applaud you for being quite courageous. It's so very brave of you to challenge me. I am the Silver Alchemist! [loud noise] It's been so long since I fought! [squelch] Ah, well, it seems I only scratched you. This is a scratch to you? Huh? Mmm hmm. [electrical cracking noise] Arrrgh! [splash] [muffled cry] [dramatic music] [train horn sounds] Al, come on! [Al] Ah! I'm sorry. You know I can't run through the crowds, it's dangerous. Alright, but I'll leave you behind if you miss the train. I'm not the one who forgot it was his State Alchemy assessment today. Huh? What'd you say? - [train horn sounds] - [Al] Nothing. Hey, isn't that the train to Central? Damn it! Damn! [grandiose music] Thank God! Huh? [exclaims] [Al] You must've been so hungry, you passed out. That was my apple pie... Huh? Hey! Hey... Ah, that's better. I'm touched by how nice people are here. Thanks so much. I'm Lin Yao. I'm from Xing. Xing? The eastern kingdom? Yes, so... [Al] That's so far away. Are you sightseeing? I came to learn more about alchemy here. We call it the Purification Arts in Xing. [Al] Right, Xing's Purification Arts, they're a little different from alchemy, right? I believe it had many more uses in the medical field. Oh wow, the two of you know a lot. Well... The Philosopher's Stone, you know it? I want to find it. Know anything? Nope. Don't know it. Hmm. [questioningly] You sure about that? I think you know something. And just what would you do with this Philosopher's Stone? Get the secret to immortality. Oh, come on! Let's go, Al. What the hell are you trying to do? It's my family situation. I need it for them. - [man] Nobody move! - [shocked voices exclaim] - [gun cocks] - [screams] [machine gunfire] We're after the military bastard who's riding on this train today. If you comply, we won't hurt anyone else. [Al] Military bastard, do you think someone important is on the train? Who knows? The military is full of bastards. Hey, what if it's the Colonel? [snickers] Hey! Shut your mouth and sit down! You, uh... shouldn't point that at me. What the hell you mean? [grunts] No. [dramatic music] [groans] [frightened cries] Who are you? Alright. Tell me later. I got to take back the train. What's going on? You're gonna tell us everything. Tell us all about the Philosopher's Stone. Tell me. There's more important problems right now. The hell! [dramatic music] Oooh! Ahh! This is annoying. Stop moving! The hell? [music crescendos] [Al] Brother! Are you okay? You're so insane. No more holding back, then! [dramatic music] Ahh! You're gonna show us what's under your mask now? A girl? Uh! Yo, Edward. Lieutenant Colonel? I know it's not actually you. So you're alive, Envy? Get it together. You're a precious human sacrifice candidate. We can't have you dying here. [Lin Yao] You've got a strange body. How many people you got in there? Huh? You can tell that? How many? Listen up. I really hate fighting. Envy? - [electrical hissing noise] - No. I just died once. Don't bother. This thing's a homunculus. They don't die when you kill them. So they're an immortal? Huh? Something like that. Ranfun! Go capture this thing. [dramatic music] Ah! Let's go! [Ed] Do what you want. Let's go, Al. We're almost to Central station. I'm handing you over when we get there. So, what was your goal here? We were going to take an Amestrian military officer hostage to demand the release of our captured comrade! [explosion] Come on! What's going on now? [laughs] Our plan may have failed but we destroyed the brakes, so we'll crash into Central Station, killing that bastard and all of us! This is bad, brother. Central is a terminal station! Yeah, people exploding today! Al, we gotta stop it. Okay. [train horn sounds] [crash] Brother! - [crash] - Ah! We'll never make it now! [Al] Brother, if you force it to brake, it will derail! Yeah, we just need to make it slow down. [electrical hissing] - [metal squealing] - [people exclaiming] [train horn sounds] [people screaming] [sighs in relief] So close. Shit! Let go of me! [man] Hey, Fullmetal. I didn't ask for the welcome party. Oh, I'm not here for you. Good job with the train. Ughh! Die! Ooh. Uhh! You son of a bitch! Just who you think you are? Roy Mustang. Rank Colonel. And also, I'm the Flame Alchemist. Don't forget it. Is that your first time seeing him in action? Oh, Second Lieutenant, have you seen it before? Yeah. The Colonel's glove is made from a special ignition cloth that creates a really bright spark through friction. Then he manipulates the oxygen in the air around him for a nice little... Boom! [laughs] Salute! [military drums] The bastard on the train was... Führer President King Bradley? We came to escort you, Führer President. We're glad you're safe. Good work. That was quite the show you put on, Edward Elric. No... nice work, Fullmetal Alchemist. [portentous music] [man] Serial murders of State Alchemists? Five have been killed in Central, ten throughout the country. What's more, the alchemists being targeted are seasoned soldiers. So who's targeting them? [woman] They appear out of thin air with an unknown weapon. All we know is they have a large scar on their forehead. A large scar? Indeed. For now, we are calling him Scar. Scar... A mark on his forehead... For your protection, Breda and Falman will be accompanying you. It'd be best for you to lay low. We'll guard you with our lives. [jaunty music] Did we lose them? - Go! - No, they're still on us. We're not some damn babies. And we don't need annoying escorts. A man with a mark on his forehead. Scar. Huh? [exclaims] [Al] Look at the clothes, I wonder who it is. [Ed] Al! We can't just leave them. [exasperated sigh] Mmm. I'm May Chang. This is Xiaomei. We're here from Xing. Yeah, we guessed that. [Al] You didn't come to Amestris to sightsee, did you? No. I'm here for the secret to being immortal. Is that a Xing trend right now? Anyway, I was about to starve to death before achieving my goal. So... thank you from the bottom of my heart. I mean, we're just a couple of decent human beings. Not you. What you did was step all over me. You were gonna leave. Huh? Lord Alphonse was my savior today. And this little runt here didn't do anything! Oh, you said the word... [juddering] Runt? Yes, a mini, shrimpy little runt! [roars] Who are you calling somebody the size of a shrimp? Ahhhh! Tiny little girl, come back here! You'll never catch me, tiny rice man! Help me! This strange man is chasing me. Nah! Thank you very much for saving me, sir. And Lord Alphonse, I thank you too. Mr. Elric! Mr. Edward Elric! You can't just run off on us like that. The Colonel ordered us to guard you. Yeah, yeah. Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist. - He's got a forehead scar! - No, don't! [Al] Brother! Run now, Al! This guy's bad! Go run. [Al] Brother, this way! [dramatic music] - [crash] - [rumbling] [Al] Now he can't follow us. No way. You gotta be kidding! Who the hell are you? Why are you targeting State Alchemists, huh? There are those who create... and then there are those who destroy. I am a chosen instrument of God's divine judgement. So we got to fight, is that right? [electrical hissing sound] You are very brave. [dramatic music] It's empty. Al, no! Bastard! [electrical vibration] Come on! Automail. I see. That explains why I couldn't destroy it. Brother, run! You idiot! I'm not leaving you behind! I'll start by destroying this annoying right arm of yours. Brother! This is your chance to pray to God. Are you only looking to kill me? I only have business with you, the Fullmetal Alchemist. No one else. Okay. Then just promise you won't hurt my little brother. What are you saying, brother? What are you doing? Run away! Get up and run! You have my word. Don't do it! Please stop! [screams] Stop it! [gunshot] That's far enough. You're under arrest for the serial murders of State Alchemists here in Central. If you insist on interfering, I'll destroy you too. Oh, are you now? You can stand down. Red Transmutation Circle and white gloves? Are you the Flame Alchemist? That'd be me. [Scar] What a truly blessed day it is. The blasphemous sinners have come to me on their own. They'll receive their divine punishment. You know who I am and you still wish to challenge the Flame Alchemist? You must be mad! What the hell are you doing? You're useless when it rains, so please stand back! Useless? With your gloves all damp, you can't make sparks. Ishvala smiles upon me. I will now destroy anyone who would interfere with me. Just try it! I'm really impressed you could dodge my attack, you scoundrel. You say you plan to destroy all of us? Then may I suggest you start right here. I'll introduce myself. I'm the Strong Arm Alchemist, Alex Louis Armstrong is here to take you down! [grunts] Why is he nude? Ahh! [gasping] Red eyes and olive skin... He's an Ishvalan. There are too many to take on at once here. [Mustang] Stand down. We're no match for him here. [Ed] Al! Al, are you okay? [Al] You stubborn... idiot! Why didn't you run away when I told you to? Because... I wasn't gonna leave you behind! That's what I'm saying is stupid! Only an idiot would choose death when there's still a chance to survive! Don't call me an idiot, I'm older than you! Who cares about that! We promised each other. We promised we'd stay together 'til we get our bodies back. But then, you go and choose to die? That's unacceptable! Ah... [sighs] Look at the two of us. [Al] Yeah, but we're alive. Yeah... We are. [Mustang] The Ishvalans were a tribe in the east who worshipped Ishvala as their main god. There was tension with the state caused by these religious differences. Then an officer shot and killed an Ishvalan child 13 years ago. It started an all out rebellion. After seven years of fighting, the military command decided to conduct a campaign against Ishvala using State Alchemists. It was a massacre, so many were killed. Many State Alchemists were recruited as living weapons. I was one of those weapons. So that man is justifiably seeking vengeance as a survivor. [chuckles] Come on now. You can't justify vengeance if you hurt innocent people in the process. I will take him down the next time I see him, I swear. But you have something to do first. You need to go and get your arm repaired. Yeah, that sure makes a lot of sense. You couldn't even perform alchemy even if you wanted to. That's true. What kind of alchemist isn't able to use alchemy? You're useless. - Huh? - Now, now... Alphonse needs to be fixed too. [sighs] Yeah, you're right. I'll just go and pay a visit to my mechanic right now. Am I mistaken or are you happy? Huh? No, what are you talking about? I am not happy or even excited... [heavy breathing] [man] I smell... Oh, look. Something smells so yum, it's an Ishvalan, I think. Can I eat? [Envy] Yeah. You can have him, go crazy. [breathing through teeth] Oh, I was worried when the two of you disappeared. Oh no, you again? There are multiple souls inside the large one too. This country is so cool. It's full of immortals. Gluttony... You can eat them all. [roars] [dramatic music] Edward Elric, so he passed his State Alchemist assessment. He still plans on being a dog, then. I wonder if he'll get his body back first. Or perhaps be sent to battle as a living weapon for us? Oh, that hell... Are you suggesting... we send our youths into that hell once again? After the Ishvalan rebellion, don't you think this country has reached a point where it needs to change? And only those who can strive for the top, who know the pain of war, will be able to achieve this large scale change. [child] Welcome home, Father! Thank you, Selim. How was the inspection today? Ah, it was quite a fruitful endeavor. Oh yes, I got to meet the Fullmetal Alchemist. The little alchemist? Yes. Yay! Please, please, I want to learn alchemy too! Now why do you want to learn that? I want to get my State qualification so I can help out Father. [laughs] [Führer] You can't, Selim. [laughs] [train horn sounds] [flighty music] [boy] It feels great. Amazing work, Pinako. [Pinako] Can I interest you in upgrading to automail? I don't think I could do it. Well, then. There he is. [drilling sound] [dog barking outside] [squealing] Where did my beautiful automail go? Well, as you can see, it was destroyed completely. Just how reckless are you two being out there? I need some emergency repairs. Uh, it's not exactly a repair when you have nothing left. [exasperated groans] Anyway, you can get in line. Yes! Did you not sleep? Mm, I'm finally done. This here is my best work yet. Looks like all that work you put in paid off. [muted laugh] Where's Ed? He left saying he was going to visit his mother's grave. He'll be back. Alright, then. I'll go pick some flowers for Mom and Dad too. [Pinako] You don't have to change their flowers every day. [woman] It's fine. It's part of my routine. [gentle music] Van Hohenheim! Edward? What a shock. You've grown. At least, I think. Don't say that, of course I've grown! You're famous around Central for being the smallest State Alchemist in history. Not small, just young! Ah. Anyway, who cares about that? You prick. What the hell are you doing here, you jerk? You shouldn't call your father a jerk, you know. Do you even know how hard it was, huh? For Mom to raise us on her own after you left her? Trisha. Why'd you have to leave? [grunts angrily] [Van Hohenheim] You're growing your hair out, huh? We match. Quit following! Aren't you going to Pinako's? I am too. Who is that man with the scar? His destructive power was actually shocking. That was more like self-destruction. I would guess he's still alive. Thanks to him, we lost our lead on the immortals. I apologize, my prince. Now then, I guess we'll just have to beg that little one to tell us something. Aw, you should not have to beg for information. You are not a commoner. There's no time to be conventional. Not with the responsibilities I have. [ominous music] Where is this? Where am I? Everybody is gone. Brother... [man] Hi. Who are you? You are not an Ishvalan. Oh, that's smart. I'm a State Alchemist and I will be... the one to purge this district. [laughing] [cosmic explosion] Oh, are you awake now? Where am I? [man] You're right outside the city, in the slums. [laughs] Don't worry. Many of the people here are Ishvalan refugees from the war. So then... was I saved by someone? I was so shocked. I found your body just floating down in the sewers. I see. It was you. How awesome. Those tattoos are incredible. I received them... from my brother. Is Ed still upstairs sleeping? Should I wake him up? No. I'm going to be late for my train. Can I have this? This one here? Take as many photos as you like. No, just this one. We took this one all together. Pinako... I need to tell you a little secret. [Pinako] Hmm? Do you know about Xerxes? The legendary city that was destroyed overnight? Something terrible will happen to this country as well. Are you saying that... that we will become like Xerxes? This is your warning. [Ed] What the hell is he talking about? There's nothing in Xerxes now. So you were listening. Apparently there are some ruins left in the desert to the east. Ruins... [yawns] [woman] He didn't have to rush out like that. Oh, but that boy has always been so quick. to rush into action. [chuckles] Asking all these questions about Xerxes suddenly while I've been up all night working for him! Huh? Uh oh. [mysterious music] It's different from a regular circle. [grunts] Sorry, I don't have any money. An Ishvalan? You're gonna become our hostage so we can demand he liberate Isvhal! [dramatic music] Stop! This display is disgraceful. Elder Shan. Sorry about these young ones here. They're all insolent fools. Why are you helping me? I can't forgive your people for driving us out here. Of course, I understand you people are the ones who took everything from us. However... I also understand that not all Amestrians are bad people. There are those who wish to help us. [boy] During the rebellion, we were very lucky, Amestrian doctors saved both Elder Shan and I. We're all alive today because they rescued us. Doctors? You know, actually, my friend's parents, they were both doctors. The two of them went to help in Isvhal during the war. Parents? Could it be... the Doctors Rockbell? You know them? Yes, of course we do. They're the amazing doctors who saved the two of us. So, it was them. They said they had a daughter back at home. I think her name was... Winry? That's it. Winry. Why is there an Amestrian in here, huh? I won't be treated by the enemy! Too bad, I'm going to be treating you anyway. Now, show me your leg. Just get out of Ishval already! I will when there are no more patients to help. You! You're a hypocrite! Call me what you want. I'd rather do something than do nothing. [gentle music] [man] Sorry. Medical supplies have been hard to come by. We really need more anesthetics. Great, this the medicine? Doctor, this is getting... alarming. I can give you a ride out. You've done so much already. There's still more work to be done here. Look around. Do you see all the injured people here? [woman] I'm sorry. But thank you. [man] I see. Well, then. Please, take care of yourselves here. [draws breath] There goes the last ride. Winry's going to be so mad. I promised we'd be back soon. What are you saying, love? Don't you think Winry would be more upset if we'd left people behind? [chuckles] Despite all warnings, the Doctors Rockbell stayed in the warzone even when the rebellion worsened. They helped us until the end. I see. How did they die? They were killed by a patient. An Ishvalan that they were helping. No way... How could someone do that? [Shan] I'm sorry. We weren't able to stop it from happening. Who did this, then? I never got to see his face. He had bandages around his forehead to cover a large wound. On his forehead... This man was an Ishvalan warrior monk with multiple tattoos on his right arm. Hi Scar, you have a visitor. Master. [Scar] I'm glad you're well. I am also glad to see you alive. [sigh] [Japanese music] I heard you headed south with comrades. Did you return? [grunts] The south has become less and less safe as of late. When we were on the move, I heard some rumors about you. I've heard that you've been going around killing State Alchemists. [draws breath through nose] I do understand, of course, the hatred you have. However, what you are doing now is only going to make the anger and hatred worse. Vengeance will only bring about more anger and vengeance. As much as it pains me to say this, we must be the ones to break this fruitless cycle. You must be the one to endure it. I'll never get used to how crowded Central is. I need to hurry up and fix Al. [Selim] Mr. Edward? Huh? It's you! You're the State Alchemist, Mr. Edward, right? - Hey. - Wow. You're just as small as the rumors say. Come here. Just because you're a kid... - Doesn't mean that I can't... - [Führer] He saw you... from the window of the car. Führer President Bradley! This is Selim, my son. [Führer] He really, really admires everything about you. Hey, Mr. Edward, please teach me alchemy sometime. [footsteps] [Al] Scar killed Winry's parents? I mean, I haven't verified it yet. [Al] Well, you can't tell Winry. Like I would do that! [Al] Yeah, I know. [electrical buzzing] [Al grunts] I'm back. Thank you, brother. Yeah. [straining] Also, I saw Hohenheim. He mentioned something terrible was gonna happen to this country. Something terrible? You know how homunculi call us human sacrifices? They're always saying that they can't have us die. Think it has something to do with that. There are so many mysteries. Yeah. I believe that if we could capture a homunculus, we can get the information from them directly. [rattling] Hi. I heard everything. Lin! [Lin Yao] Wow, that looks delicious. Hang on! [sighs] So, I'll help you capture a homunculus. We too want to do that. Huh? Just what are you planning? We want the secrets to the homunculus as well. [child] Come on, you guys! There's a little alchemist here. He'll fix anything you ask! They call him the Fullmetal Alchemist. Mr. Scar, I managed to get some food to eat. Huh? [jaunty music] Damn it! Look what you've gone and done here! I'm sorry. I'll pay for it. How am I going to run my shop? [Ed] Sounds like you could use some help. The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric is here! Don't worry, I can fix this right up. [electrical hissing] Whoa, wow! Thank you very much! It's nothing. [Al] Come here! Can we really draw out Scar like this? Are you getting cold feet? You and Lin agreed to this plan, you know. We make a commotion to draw Scar out, and when you and I are in danger, brother, the homunculi will be showing up. Yes, I know, I agreed to it. And then we both take action. He did surprise me with what he said. [Ed] A prince? It is so. The emperor of Xing's 12th son. [Al] Twelfth? There are that many princes? There are about 40 princes and princesses. Forty? Are you sure? That's why someone like me has a real shot at the throne eventually. Why do you need immortality, then? The current emperor has fallen ill, he doesn't have much time left. That's why we're all trying to gain favor. Many of us are frantically searching for the secret to immortality. But if the emperor becomes immortal, won't the throne stay occupied? My plan is to get first on his good side. I'll show him immortality so he'll give my clan more power while he's alive. After that, I'll take the throne from him by force. [Ed] Oh. Fighting for the throne... sounds intense. [Al] I still have a hard time believing Lin is an actual prince. Same here. [ominous music] [Al] It actually worked. [dramatic music] [cosmic crash] Tattoos on his right arm! Asshole. He murdered Winry's parents. Geez. They're not at the hotel room or base. Where the heck did they go? [sighs] I came all this way to give this to him. [man 1] The Fullmetal Alchemist is fighting him. There are military police running around everywhere. [man 3] He's fighting the man killing all of the State Alchemists. - No way. Are you for real, man? - Yes. [man 3] That's scary. Hey, there! I smell it, I smell it. The Ishvalan I didn't get to eat last time. Again with these stupid brothers? Can't they relax for one second? Ahhhhh! We were waiting. Oh, the mark of the homunculus, so that's the Ouroboros tattoo. [clicks tongue, sighs] Time to give up, okay? There's no use trying to run. It's easy to track you. You have a unique energy. This time, immortality will be ours. Something is happening in the city. [dramatic music] Eeeh! [grunting, groaning] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Nice one, little bro! [Al] No, stay back! Ahhh! Huh! Ahh. I'm sorry... Hey, come on. Stop hurting innocent soldiers! [Scar] This would be over if you would just accept your punishment. [distant explosion] Brother, we need to fall back. Great news, the homunculus are here. There's something I wanted to ask you. Since you represent your god, do you not feel guilt for taking the lives of innocent doctors? Do you remember the Rockbells, the Amestrian doctors? They went to Ishval to help people. They stayed - [Al] Uh! - after extermination orders were issued. - Wait, brother! - Scar! Do you remember killing the doctors who saved your life? Brother! What's this? What are you saying? This man here... is the one who killed my mom and dad? No way, they were killed by... by someone they helped? So did you... kill my mother and father? [sad music] You're not saying no. What did they ever do to you? What did my parents do? They didn't do anything wrong, they didn't deserve to die. [sobbing] Give them back! Give me back my mom and dad! [ominous music] Please, Winry! Come on, listen to me now. Winry! I'm begging you! Just... don't do it. You shouldn't be holding a gun! You're the doctors' daughter. You have every right to shoot me. But the moment you do, I will consider you an enemy. You prick. I won't let you hurt her. - I'll kill you! - You'll kill me? Go ahead then! This chain of hate will only stop when one of us dies. Mom... Dad... Don't do it. Put it down. Put the gun down and get out of here. Hurry! If you can't shoot me, then leave. You're in the way! [aching violin music] Don't! [shouting] Get down! [Al] Get Winry somewhere safe! [footsteps receding] - Winry... - [wind blowing] Let it go. [tearfully] I couldn't shoot him... even though he... I'm glad you didn't, okay? Still... He killed my mom and dad. And he almost killed you and Al. [sad music] Hey, look at me. You look after so many people in Resembool who are missing limbs. Especially me. You gave me an arm and a leg so I could stand. Your hands... aren't meant for killing. They're meant to help. - [music swells] - [sobbing] - [woosh] - [voice cries out] [grunts] Damn it! How did they know about us? [blade swishes] [chuckles softly] Hey, would you just let us capture you already? [tense music] Foreign stranger. Get out of my country or be purged. My prince! [Lin Yao] Ranfun! [dramatic music] [grunts] Well, well. You're quite the fighter. It was smart to think of targeting my blind spot. [Gluttony roars] Hang in there, Ranfun. We got to run. [grunts] I don't get it. You could've escaped by yourself without a doubt right this second. Why wouldn't you choose to abandon that dead weight? She's not dead weight. Aren't you the most powerful person in this country? A king serves his people. Without people, there can be no king. King Bradley! You will never ever be a true king. What's wrong? Surprised I can still see from this eye? [music crescendos] My goodness. Such a reckless child. Another dead end. [Ranfun] My prince, at this rate, he will catch us. - My prince. - What is it? It's my left arm. It's completely done for. I won't be able to fight now. Without people, there can be no king. That's true, but... without their king, his people will be lost. I won't. There are many things you would abandon for the greater good. What are you thinking? Don't you dare! [Ranfun cries out] Your armor, it's empty inside. Is it because of alchemy? [Al] That's right. How sad. You still choose to believe in alchemy after what it did to you. Yes. Sure, the suit can be difficult but I'm not unhappy. I don't need pity from you. I believe in the possibility alchemy holds! Then I don't need to hold back with you. [Al] No! Oh no! Brother! Winry is safe, I took her back. Okay, let's try this again! [deep breathing] [Gluttony] I found you! Ishvalan. [dramatic music] [electrical buzzing] [Gluttony roars] Come on! Lin was supposed to capture this one. You're here! [grunts] Get down! Make a sturdy wire! Yeah! [electrical buzzing] [groans] The more he regenerates, the tighter the binding will get. We caught a homunculus! [ominous music] Very well done. [Ranfun] This way, he won't be able to follow my trail. [breathing deeply] They showed you, you soulless monster. I did get away. [groaning] I've kept my promise. I don't know what this is about, but I'll finish my punishment. Load that thing up, we're heading out! Huh, who are you? Lieutenant? The military is coming. Hurry now! Go on ahead. We'll deal with Scar for now. I need you to pick someone up for me. Mr. Scar! Are you okay? [Al] May? Huh? Lord Alphonse? What is happening here, Mr. Scar? I'll explain it later. [squealing] Scar! [man] You walked through the sewers after amputating your arm? You know you could get tetanus. It's been a while since I've operated on someone. It might be rough. Can you hold the shoulders down for me? Right. [cries out] [distant cries] Sorry. It was all my idea. You don't need to apologize. I knew we'd make sacrifices since we were after immortality. I should've been more prepared, though. Ranfun was more prepared than I was. [sad music] [groans of agony] [Mustang] She's a strong warrior. Yes, she's the best. Uh... I'm a colonel in the Amestrian army, Roy Mustang. I'm 12th Prince of Xing empire, Lin Yao. Thank you for bringing us here. [groaning] [door opens] I'm still impressed you managed to capture one of these alive. We're taking him to Xing with us but you can ask him whatever you want before. Words cannot express how much I loathe these things. And now, it seems they've infiltrated some of the military's top command. Some of the top command? It's worse than that. King Bradley is definitely a homunculus too. Huh? The marks on his eye, I saw it underneath his eyepatch. Plus his abilities are superhuman. Unbelievable! [Al] The most powerful man in the country is a homunculus? No, hold on a second. The Führer has a kid. Oh, right. Homunculi shouldn't be able to reproduce. Yeah. [Mustang] No... He adopted his son Selim. Adopted? Huh. Human or monster, either way, this makes it much easier to drag him out of his top spot. [door closes] [faint growl] Mustang, he killed Lust... [Gluttony] Mustang, he killed Lust... Lust... [dark music] [man] Wrath, why are you allowing the Flame Alchemist to wonder about as he pleases? Roy can be used. [man] He can be used? To open the door. He can open the portal. [man] I'll leave it to you. [Al] Are you okay? [banging] Old Man Foo! Look at you, saved by your prince while losing your arm. - What was that? - You dare to call yourself a member of the Yao clan? Stop it, old man. She's hurt. [draws breath shakily] Is it gone? Is... your arm gone? I'm sorry, Grandfather. [emotionally] I'm sorry. [sniffing] Xiaomei... Just go look for her. No. Treating your leg wound is more important. The bullet passed right through. We need to stop the bleeding. What are you doing? I will close the wound with Purification Arts. - [dramatic music] - [electrical buzzing] You're not going to ask about it? For now, let's just focus on getting you healed up first. Mr. Scar, I notice the tattoos on your right arm seem to be a combination of alchemy and Purification Arts. [emotional music] Is this who I'm supposed to be now? Where's the Colonel? Back at the base. I think he's trying to wrap his head around the Führer news. Have you ever felt... that your gun was a burden? I don't think I have the right to call it a burden. I've taken so many lives in the past before. Do you mean... the Ishvalans? I do. Can I ask you about Ishval? Winry's parents died there, Scar is from there. There's so much I don't know. I'm fed up with not knowing more about it. [gun thuds on table] They sent me among others to Ishval during the war. It was my last year at the academy. - [shouting] - [dramatic music] [lieutenant] To put an end to the seven-year rebellion, Führer Presidential Order 3066 was issued. It sent a large group of State Alchemists into battle as living weapons. That was only the beginning of the genocidal campaign. Big brother, the Amestrian army is close. What are those tattoos? Ah, these? The foundations of alchemy are comprehension, deconstruction, reconstruction. The right arm is deconstruction and the left is reconstruction. Alchemy again? Well, it's called the Purification Arts in the empire of Xing. I combined them as well as my own research. That doesn't matter right now. Amestrians are on their way! [distant explosions] The attack has begun. Roy! Hughes... You got sent here too? Yeah. It's been a while, Roy... Oh. It's Major Mustang now, I guess. [scoffs] [Hughes] You... look different than before. You look different too. We're murderers now. Yeah. Hey... Is it just me or is this genocide campaign way too risky? Is this really just to crush the rebellion? It's funny. I had the same exact thought. [tense music] [cries out] [thud] [gunshot] [Mustang] Duck, Hughes! Gunfire? It's okay, Roy. We have a hawk's eye on our side. Look. A hawk's eye? [Hughes] Yeah. A nameless sniper. They're still a cadet but they have sure got the skills. [Mustang] They put a greenhorn out in the field? [shell casing drops to the ground] Oh, there you are. Thanks for the help back there, you saved us. Good to see you again, Major Mustang. [panicked shouting] Brother! Brother! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. The State Alchemists are closing in. Here. What are you doing? It's my research book, take this and run. Now hold on a sec. Carry it yourself while we run! You're an amazing warrior monk. I believe in your chances of survival. Brother... [dramatic music] It's a State Alchemist! [buzzing sound] Get down! [Scar] Brother! Oh, wonderful. Oh, wonderful! An amazing view... An amazing view! [shrieks and laughs maniacally] [dark music] Please hold on. Your arm... Where's your arm? Who the hell took my brother's arm? Damn, the bleeding won't stop. Someone! You'll live. You can't die. No, don't move yet. You'll open your wounds. It's brother's arm... Don't move yet. Thank goodness. Brother is alive. What is going on? [shrieks] Sedative! I think we just used the last of it. Get down! State Alchemists... Amestrians... They will pay! You all... You all will pay! Dr. Rockbell, watch out! [roars] [lieutenant] The genocide campaign in Ishval ended quickly after State Alchemists were used. [crowd cheering] [celebratory shouts] It's finally over. Hughes... What do you think was the purpose of us fighting in this war? People of our rank only receive orders from those above. So many have died. We protected people too. Go ahead, call me naive, but... I want to protect everyone. If you want to do that, you'll need to climb up to the top up there. Hey, one day, I want to see what kind of country you envision from up there. [background noise fades to silence] [gentle music] [Mustang] Comrade in arms? No. An Ishvalan child was shot and killed here. Let's go. The war is over now. I am the one who trusted you with my father's research, and the one who created the Flame Alchemist. [sighs] This is never what I wanted it to be used for. But I can't escape from the truth either. Denial, atonement, begging for forgiveness are all self-serving. Only us soldiers are the ones who get our hands dirty and spill blood. However, right now, we need to survive and change this country together. If I ever start to stray from the path, I need you to kill me yourself. You and you only have that right. [Xiaomei squeaks] You're a strange little cat, aren't you? [chuckles] Wait. Are you actually a dog? Hmm. No, you're definitely a cat. But you don't bark or meow. [chuckles] Xing is full of strange mysteries. [squeaks] Huh? Xiaomei? - Oh, it's you! I was so worried. - [squeaks] [squeaks sadly] [squeaks] Let's go. Mr. Scar is waiting for us. [tense music] [Ed] Good job, Al. You did it. [Al] But shouldn't we wait for the colonel? No, we'll capture that bastard ourselves and to make him beg Winry for forgiveness. [Al sighs] - [door opening] - Duck down! [door being shut and locked] [Al] I can't believe that she's actually a princess. What do you mean? Who is? Oh. Well, Lin didn't tell you? May is a rival from the Chan clan trying for the emperor's throne as well. You sure? That girl? She's a royal? Do you need anything else? I'll get water and food for us. [no response] Right. I'll be back. [tense music] [door opens] Give yourself up already. I admire your attitude, turning yourself in. Ah. Is that what you think? [dramatic music] [grunt] [Ed] Your left leg is hurt, isn't it? You'll never be able to keep up with me with your injury. Your ability isn't scary if you can't get your hands on me. Good, he fell for it. Good job, Al. I've been noticing you have a habit, Scar. You're always escaping to the ground just to get away. - Brother, we should seal his right arm. - Yeah. I actually destroyed more than just the floor this time. [cracking noises] [exclamations] [shouting] [muffled grunts] That guy... is out of his damn mind. [groans] [rising tense music] [electronic sound] [roar] [running footsteps] Winry! [groans] [electronic buzzing] Stay back for now. Why the hell did you bring her here? It was me. I begged him to let me. Wait, don't get too close. It's okay, Ed. No, please, just stay here. Let me talk to him. I wanted to speak to him, directly this time. Tell me. Why did you kill my mom and dad? Whatever I say would just be an excuse. [exclaiming] It is a fact that I killed both of the Rockbell doctors. And that is why the privilege to punish me is yours alone. [gentle music] You will die of shock if we don't stop the bleeding. [Winry sighs] If my parents were here... I know they would've patched you up. This is a life Mom and Dad saved. So there... has to be a reason. Are you saying you forgive me? Don't get the wrong idea. I don't forgive what you've done. [Scar's master] You must endure it. You're asking me to forgive what they did to us? Enduring is not the same as that. You do not have to forgive what they've done but as people. We are forced to endure this terrible pain. Someone must endure it. We must endure it, endure it and more, so that the cycle of hate can finally be broken. When negative thoughts gather, the world would be covered in negativity but also, we can gather positive thoughts and cover the world in positivity. [gentle music] [Ed] Winry... I'm okay. I won't cry now. Winry might think that way, but I can tell you that Al and I want to beat the crap out of you and make you look at the Rockbells' grave someday. You'll accept your punishment and pay for your crimes. I am... the rot of hatred that was born from that war. Rot cannot be saved. God does not save rot. Someone like me deserves to decay in the gutter. Listen. Not that I think apologizing now would change anything that happened, nor am I looking for forgiveness either. But... [inhales through nostrils] I am sorry. [Lin Yao] Ed! We're in trouble! [crashing sound] [ominous music] Mustang... he killed Lust... Mustang! [roars] [thunderous noise] What the... hell was that? [grunts] Ahh! [groans] Colonel! Colonel! Colonel! [Al] Uh! Brother, Scar got away! Darn it! [Gluttony groans] [roar] Winry! [exclaims] Now's your chance, get out of here! [growling] Listen to me, just get out of here! We'll come back for you, Scar. [roar] [grunts and groans] Lieutenant, please go. Wait. I won't leave you behind. - [engine starts] - You'll just get in our way like this. Colonel, your fight is elsewhere. [dark music] Winry needs you. I got it. Lieutenant. [crashing sound] [groans] Mustang... he killed Lust. Hey, Gluttony! Calm down, Gluttony. We told you, you can't swallow the Flame Alchemist or this little one. Mustang, he killed Lust! You'll make Father angry. Father will be... upset with me? That's right. Father will be very mad. Mad? Right. I'll capture Envy and leave Gluttony to you. [grunts] [grunts] I'm not allowed to eat you! Bastard! I'm not allowed to eat you! [grunts] []shouts] Do it, Gluttony! Lin! He'll swallow you! Hold on, don't eat the human sacrifice! Brother! [groans] Oh. I ate the sacrifice... Brother... Brother! I swallowed Envy too... Brother! Lin! Spit them out! Spit my brother and Lin out! I'm sorry. They're inside. It can't be. Brother... [distressed howl] [coughing] It stinks. Oh man! What's that smell? It smells like iron. Is this blood? Oh yeah. Gluttony swallowed me. Hey, is anyone here? What's this place's deal? Hey, Al! Stupid Lin Yao! [Lin Yao] Who are you calling stupid? That's no way to address a prince, you know. Hey, so you're okay. So, where the hell is this place? I don't know. I walked pretty far in that direction but it was just darkness. [Envy] Oh, it's you two. Envy! How do we get out of here? There is no way out. We're stuck. This is just fantastic. Gluttony, that idiot, he swallowed me too. Damn. Swallowed? This is really the inside of Gluttony's stomach? Gluttony is a Portal of Truth Father made himself. Is this The Portal of Truth? No, but... this isn't like the inside of the Portal of Truth I know. [no audio] Even Father couldn't create a real Portal of Truth. This is one of his few failures. Failures? Yes. This is the space between reality. There's no exit. Hey, what's this Portal of Truth? [Envy laughs] Nobody can escape from here. They can only wait for their lives to end as they grow weaker. Everybody dies here. You're lying! I'm not lying at all. You will die in here just like everyone, you got that? I've had just about enough of your crap! [thud] The hell? You didn't budge. You wanna go, you little brat? Show me, go ahead! I'll show you something good before you die. [fierce groaning] This is... really bad, isn't it? Uh-huh. [dramatic music] [loud roar] [triumphant music]
