And you said this was the grand prize. A vacation with my son is more like the booby prize. For once, I agree with you, Mama. Take her away, stranger. Quick, Trudy, let's pack up the house and move before she comes back. Now, wait a minute. I think a vacation together could be just what this family needs. Excuse me, sir, where did you say we were going again? Legume island. Legume island. I've never heard of it. Is it nice and relaxing? Oh, it's to die for. (SINISTER CACKLE) Fantastic!

Aah! What country does this flag represent? It represents my fist! Now, gimme those! It's my suitcase, you nitwit! Mom, can I have some of these peanuts from the minibar? I'm hungry.

Mr. Proud, perhaps I can interest you in a private tour of my estate. Absolutely! You know, you look real familiar to me. Have we met? I don't think we have. No, I'm sure I've seen you somewhere. And your face... you were singin' and dancin' and... And you was actin' and rappin'. I got it. You were in Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. You boogaloo shrimp! No, no, no. How 'bout Beat Street?

Don't mess with me, y'all! Huh? How do? Cashew, you scared me! I was just checking to see if you were okay. You seem upset. Yeah. It's a long story. Well, if you want to tell it, I'm all ears. Actually, I'm all head, but, heh, you know what I mean. Well, it all started on my third birthday. Daddy didn't want to pay for a clown. He's so cheap sometimes. So he dressed up in Suga Mama's nightgown... So embarrassed... And when I turned 4, Mom hired Thingy for my birthday. Thingy and Daddy got into an argument, and then Thingy dropkicked Daddy. Now, today's my 16th birthday. It's supposed to be the best day of my life, right? Right. But my dad said I couldn't audition to be a Spare Change Dancer, even though all my friends could. So, I snuck out and went anyway and got busted kissin' 15 Cent, so my parents canceled my birthday party and dragged me on this trip, and now my big day is ruined because my dad keeps treatin' me like a baby! (YAWNS) Well, that really is a long story. You know what it is, Cashew? Sometimes... I just wish I had different parents. I think you're lucky. I wish I had parents. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm goin' on and on about my problems, and I didn't even realize that... It's okay. Here on the island, we're kinda like one big nutty family. But there's times when I wonder what it would be like to have a real mom and dad. Well, I'll tell you what. If you ever wanna wear a burgundy sweater and skirt for the rest of your life, you can try having my parents. Hey, nice crib, Doc. Well, thank you. Care for a pistachio? (DR. CARVER LAUGHS) You're my kind of man, Mr. Proud. We're like two intellectual peas in a pod. Two nuts in the same shell. You see, like yours, my genius has never received its proper recognition. In fact, I've been working on a revolutionary new concept... friendly humanoid peanuts. It will attend to our every need. Just think of the possibilities, Mr. Proud. They could care for the elderly. Look after our children. Take over the world! I mean, make over the squirrels. (CHUCKLES) I see the future, Mr. Proud, and it's nuts. Ah, but the prototypes aren't turning out as I had hoped. They won't stabilize. It's like I need a... Oh, I don't know, instant everlasting multiplying formula or something. Stop playing. I've created an instant everlasting multiplying formula. Maybe we could be partners. As Suga Mama always told me, two geniuses are better than one halfwit. Partners? Sounds intriguing, but I don't know if I could offer you much for your expertise. Maybe only... $10 million? (STUTTERING) Ten million dollars. (OSCAR YELLING) Ahem. I mean, that's a rather intriguing offer. I'll have to discuss it with my wife. (CHUCKLES) Excellent! Then I can expect your answer in the morning? That's right. (OSCAR LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) OSCAR: Trudy! Trudy! (LAUGHING EVILLY) Oh, Romeo Pistachio, come back! Come back!

Oscar... Dr. Carver offered me $10 million to be his partner. Ten million dollars? What kind of jungle punch did you drink at the luau? (LAUGHS) Penny, where have you been? It's well past your curfew, young lady. Relax, Mom. I was just hanging out with Cashew. What? You know what I told you about hanging out with boys. You are a boy, ain't you? TRUDY: Oscar. Fine. Let's go home, and I can hang out with my friends. Hey, whoa! 'Cause they... That's quite enough, you two! Now, look, we're gonna start acting like a family and have fun on this vacation right now.

(BEEPING) My wristwatch video communicator... I must go back and get it. We're finally leaving? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Did you synchronize your wristwatch? My watch? Yeah. It says it's time to roll up out of here. So, let's bounce. What is the meaning of this "roll up out of here"? It means it's time to go, Mama, duh. VOICE 1 ON TAPE: Hello. How are you, my friend? VOICE 2: Yo, yo. We're scruga-lugga, homey. What's up, y'all? What we waiting for? You're supposed to drive. It's your mission assignment. Duh. Me? You want me to drive? You never let me drive. Is this some kind of joke? Where's the hidden camera? I would never joke about the mission. Okay. Thank you, Daddy. I'm a really good driver. You'll see. (GIGGLES) All right, adjust the mirror. Hands at 10 and 2. And ease away from the curb. Oops! Sorry. My bad. OSCAR: And I was like, "Hey, the secret formula stays on my 50," and he was all, like, "Give me the formula." And I was, like, "No can do." And he was, like, "Well, bring out the clones." I was, like, "Clones? Whatcha talkin' about, clones?" Wham! Bam! Out step the clones. Look just like us. Except for Mama. Even more hideous. Twice the... Stop talking nonsense, boy. I'm telling you it's true! We gotta get out of this place! Hey! Penny! Rise and shine, sweetie. Vacation's over. Where'd she go? Okay, listen. There's no time to panic. I'll get us out of here and find Penny. Okay. Now, it's time to panic. Help us! Help! If you want to survive, you must come with me. Immediately. What? Everyone is gone! Must alert Dr. Carver. OSCAR: Penny! There you are. Oh, Penny! Hmm? Have you been eating peanut butter or something? We must hurry. We've got to get to the other side of the island. There is only one person who can help you now. Is this a new part of the mission? Uh, yeah. We're on a mission to save our necks. Now, let's move! Penny, I need you to carry the twins, and don't give me no lip. (TWINS GIGGLE) Now, that's more like it. It's about time that girl started listening to me. (GASPS) WALLY: Quickly. We are almost to the summit. Oscar? Whoa! Oh. Oscar, don't panic. Okay. I told you, Trudy, I don't like heights. SUGA MAMA: Whoo! Ahhh! Look out there! It's not so bad, son. Unless you look down. (LAUGHS) Ahhh! That's not funny, Mama. (SUGA MAMA LAUGHING) Penny, be careful with the twins, now. That's affirmative, Mother. BOTH: Penny! Look out! (YELLS) What in the... Oscar. Did you just see... CAB DRIVER: 1433. Okay, we're here. Your monetarial compensation, sir. You may retain the balance. A thousand bucks! Thanks! Family, primary mission begins in T-minus 3...2...1. (GIGGLING) LACIENEGA: Hey, pal. ZOEY: Hey, Penny. What's up, P? How was your trip? Um... Bizarre. Ever since this morning, my mom's been talking like she's straight-up street. Man, this whip is whack, homey. Where's the secret formula, yo? And Suga Mama, I can't even understand her. No hay nada en esta caja. And my dad's been acting... Daughter, would you mind holding our currency? Kinda cool. Well, I bet he's still not cool enough to let you come to the dance rehearsal tomorrow. Whatever, LaCienega. I feel you, girl. But as Spare Change Dancers, got some pre-rehearsal shopping to do. GIRLS: Hey! What is it, daughter? Come on, Dad. Don't rub it in. You know I'm the only one who can't go to the dance rehearsals. Do you think your attendance will advance our primary mission? Well, uh, yeah, I think so. Most definitely. Then perhaps you should participate. For real? Oh, thank you. You're the best daddy in the whole world! FELIX: What's up, Oscar? My dawg. Hello, Felix Boulevardez, next door neighbor and friend. Right. So... Are we on for the stuffball game tonight or what? It's the semifinals, baby! Hasta la lima! TRUDY: Stuffball? Ooh, that's my game, dawg. Ya heard me? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Speaking of herds, this hefty heifer has escaped from her barn. (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Watch your mouth, you quirky caballero. I've got some Spanish peanut in me. (IN ENGLISH) Oscar, are you going tonight or what? One moment, please, while I converse with my associates. This could be an important fact-finding mission to see what these neighbors know about the secret formula. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a real spit, homey. I'm with it. Muy bueno. Felix Boulevardez, next door neighbor and friend, we accept your invitation. Invitation? No. You're paying for these tickets. Here's your monetarial compensation. Will $5,000 cover everything? Yes! VOICE ON RADIO: Ya, y'all, Big Boy in the hood! Now, don't forget tomorrow night is the Extreme Stuffball Championships with a halftime performance from my main man 15 Cent. Big ups to all the lucky little mamas who made the cut to join in as the Spare Change Dancers. All right, now, ooh, wow, now listen up, ladies. Now, you girls must be supertalented, superfly, and you must have a supercool dad. PENNY: Yes, I do. The coolest. (SHIVERING) This is some vacation. I'm cold, I'm tired, my ribs are still hurting from that tickle chair, and I am hungry. Mmm-mmm. Didn't know peanuts so tasty, huh, Puff? Mama! Where'd you get those peanuts? I cleaned out the minibar before we left. What? You gotta be crazy. Don't you know how much that stuff cost? I'll give you $20 for a bite. Puff? (SPITS) Here, help yourself. (GROANS) Mama, that... that is just straight-up nasty! (GRUNTS) Do you need a hand with that? What are you doing? I call it making a move. Ahhh. Ooh. Making a move is not part of the mission. (THUDS AND GRUNTS) Oscar, do you notice anything different about Penny? (WALLY GRUNTING) Yeah. She's finally handling boys the way I taught her. Oscar, she's body-slamming that poor kid against the rock. OSCAR: Well, seems like she's been working out. But that's just the Proud blood pumping through her veins. You see, we're strong people. (CHANTING) Uh-huh. And she's not complaining and whining like she always does, either. That's in the Proud blood, too. Isn't that a good thing? Oh, Oscar, it's just... My little girl's growing up so fast. Before we know it, she'll be off to college, then a career, marriage, grandkids... Whoa. Slow down, Trudy. Bebe and Cece are still in diapers and you talking about grandkids? I know, it's silly. But, in some ways, I think I'm going to miss the old Penny. Well, I'm gonna miss things, too. Like tonight. I'm missing the Wizard Kelly Extreme Stuffball Semifinals. I bet everybody's there but me. (FANFARE) (WHISTLE) (YELLING) Okay, let me get this straight. Your dad, Oscar Proud, is gonna let you be a Spare Change Dancer? I told you. My daddy's cool, now. He lets me do whatever I want. Whoa! Nice shoes! (LAUGHS) Yeah! My mom took me shopping and hooked me up. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Wait. Hang on, LaCienega. It's D. Hey, girl. Your parents bought you a polyphonic camera phone? I don't even have one of those. Hey... Ooh. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hang on, Pen. Zoey's hitting me on my two-way. Hey. What's up, girl? Hang on, guys. My other line's beeping. Hey, it's Dijonay. Do you believe Penny's mom bought her a camera phone? Stop playing. Penny, you got a new phone? Yep. Check it out. GIRLS: Dang! Yo, yo, pigeon, come on, sister. What's the 4-1-1 on Oscar's secret formula? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Suga Mama, I must apologize for my rude behavior today. (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Save your breath, you moldy muchacho. PAPI: (IN SPANISH) Playing hard to get? Hmmm... I like this new spicy taquito. (LAUGHS) Wiz Dome dogs. Get your red hots. Come and get your dogs. Yo, Oscar, are you hungry? I'll get us some hot dogs. Hey, yo! Two hot dogs over here. (LAUGHTER) Oscar, what did you do that for? Sorry about that, man. Couple more dogs. Here. Just take the whole thing. Oh, my. This is, um, tasty! ANNOUNCER: Whoo! That was some second quarter. And now for our halftime entertainment, some brave man out there will get the chance to win... (BURP) ...twelve wizard dollars by going one-on-one with the Extreme Stuffball Champ... Mayhem the Mangler, y'all. Any takers? (CROWD CHEERS) I must procure more hot dogs. ANNOUNCER: And there's our brave volunteer right now, y'all. MC: Is that Oscar Proud? Go, Oscar! Penny! Penny! That's your dad! He's gonna get mangled. Oh, no! (LOW GROWL) (CHEERING) CROWD: Mangler! Mangler! Mangler! Mangler! Where ya gonna be when Mayhem mania comes for thee? Don't worry, Penny. I'm sure your father will be okay. It's all fake. Fake? Zoey, that guy's gonna devour my daddy. (GIGGLES) Cool. MC: Now, here's the rules. Your mission is to get the ball into the opponent's goal. Other than that, just try not to get too much blood on the Wizard's nice shiny floor, y'all. (GROWLS) I'm gonna bust you up. Primary mission, put the ball in the opponent's goal. Go for it. (YELLS) Mayhem mania! (YELLS) Yo, what? No! Wait a second. Wait a second! (SCREAMS) Oh, no... not the face! (GROANS) (CHEERING) Hasta la rima! (CHEERS) CROWD: Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Yes, yes, y'all. Well done, Oscar Proud. Well, here is 12 Wizard dollars. Attorney. ATTORNEY: (SPEAKING FAST) Wizard dollars redeemable only at licensed Wizard Kelly concession stands in the 50 states and Puerto Rico. Wizard dollars are copyrighted by Wizard Kelly and may not be used without expressed permission of Wizard Kelly. Offer expires in 25 minutes, y'all. MC: Well, Oscar Proud, what are you gonna do with all them Wizard dollars? Dang, Penny. I've never seen your dad so hungry. Your mama don't cook no more? We made it. He will be able to help you now. He? He who? (WHISPERING) (LAUGHS) Wally, you've done a good job. Thank you, Father. OSCAR: Father? Listen, man, I don't know what kind of freaky family tree you fell from, but from one dad to another, you gotta help me, man. There's a guy on the other side of the island, and he's crazy... Dr. Carver. Looks like Boogaloo Shrimp! I'm telling you, he outta his mind. (BOTH LAUGH) Trust me. Dr. Carver is not crazy. What? How do you know? Because I'm... Dr. Carver. (BEEPING) Uh, you see, the Dr. Carver you've been dealing with is in fact my clone. Clone? This is a portrait of my great-great-grandfather... George Washington Carver. Is anyone here familiar with The Making of a Peanut? Ooh, ooh. Me. Me. Me. Ooh ooh ooh. I got it. I got it. Oops, here we go. Ahem. George Washington Carver, 1864 to 1943, a renowned educator and agricultural researcher who invented over 300 uses for the common peanut, including shampoo, instant coffee, and, of course, peanut butter. Very good, Mr. Proud. Ha ha! Yeah, baby! In your face, Suga Mama. Shoo, you can't tell me nothing. I know my nuts, now. I know you're nuts, too. (LAUGHING) I was interested in peanut research as well. Only instead of butter and soap, I hoped to create a new life form from the peanut genome. So I moved to this remote island and began experimenting with peanut cloning technology. My first attempt at cloning... went terribly wrong. I had to scrap the experiment and turn 'em into peanut butter. All except one. (GROWLING) My second round of experiments brought me closer to my goal. I call these friendly creatures the Genomes. They've become like family. But I longed for a protege, an intellectual equal, someone to inherit all that I have learned. So I mixed my own human DNA into the experiment and attempted to clone myself. It was truly a success. Unfortunately, one day I left him in the sun too long, and the results were disastrous. (SCREAMING) Don't worry. It's not as bad as you think. Ooh, I'm gonna getcha. I only wanted to create a companion. But instead, I created a monster. Then what happened? He went bad. Literally. Ashamed by his appearance, he disguised his deformities and became obsessed with proving to the world what peanuts were capable of. He began his own evil experiments and forced my peaceful Genomes to work for him. All except for Wally here. But recently, he's been working on something big... and possibly very, very bad. (GASPS) That's why he wanted my special Kicking Donkey Dipping Sauce. But don't sweat. Those clones will never find out where I hid it. Where did you hide it, Oscar? Somewhere very special. Inside Penny's birthday necklace. Now, where did you put it, sweetie? I... Uh... Am unauthorized to answer your question. OSCAR: What? I think what she's trying to say is she didn't open your gift, Oscar. It's still sitting in the box in Penny's bedroom back at home. I have a boat that can get us off this island. We must hurry. He must be stopped before it's too late. Going somewhere? (EVIL LAUGH) We know all about you, Dr. Peanut Brittle. How did you find us? (BEEPING) Penny told me. Penny? Penny, no! What are you doing? I can't believe it. My own daughter sold us out. Penny, why? I thought... (EVIL LAUGH) Take them away. (SHOUTING) Leave me alone! Get your hands off me! (OSCAR YELLING) (YAWNING) Morning, Suga Mama. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Good morning, my granddaughter. (GLASS BREAKING, CLATTERING) Hey! Mama! Mom, what are you doing? Yo, stop tripping, son. I'm trying to peep out the secret formula. Okay, try two eggs plus flour and milk. That's the secret formula for pancakes. We got any? 'Cause I'm starving. Oh, snaps, you talking about food. Yo, your boy OPZ's taking care of that. OPZ? Daughter. The hot dogs are almost complete. OPZ? Uh, I'll just have some juice. On second thought, I'll pass on breakfast this morning. Too long. Too short. Ooh, too cute! (HORN HONKS) Hey, 15! I'll be right down. I'll see you guys after rehearsal. Oh, and, Daddy, I never did say thanks for my birthday necklace. I love it. You're the bomb. I'm the bomb? (BEEPING) Father, do you read me? I have important news regarding the mission. Daughter? I thought you were on your way to the rehearsal. I'm still on the island. The real Penny Proud is with you. And she has the secret formula. It's in her necklace. You must retrieve it and return to Legume immediately. Time is running out. Do not fail the mission. I will not fail the mission. (GIRLS CHATTERING) NUBIA: Listen up. All dancers to the stage. Break a leg. Or Olei will break one for you. Okay, people. Here's the scenario for the halftime show. It's a love story. 15 Cent is trying to meet the girl of his dreams. But she's keeping him on ice, a'ight? 15 CENT: You ready for the big time, Ponytails? You just try to keep up. Shh, shh, shh! Quiet, everybody! Here we go. Cue music and... ♪ Blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up ♪ (SNARLS) Move it! ♪ Y'all know who I am... ♪ Be a butterfly. Be a butterfly. Careful, Zoey. You're blocking my view! Okay, Penny, get ready to move in. CHOREOGRAPHER: Let me feel it, now! More energy! (GIGGLING) Wait a minute. Cut, cut, cut! Who is this guy? (ALL GASP) Daddy? Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Hello, daughter. I'm so sorry. My dad was just checking in on me. You can dismiss him, now. Let's go, Mr. Proud. Dismiss him? I haven't seen anyone move like that since that old woman on Soul Train. Come on, pops. Do that thing again. Show me what you're workin' with! You mean... this? (MUSIC STARTS) I'm feelin' this! I'm feeling this, too! Dang! Mr. Proud is workin' it! ALL: Go, Oscar. Go, Oscar. Go, Oscar. Go, Oscar, go, Oscar, go, Oscar. (VIDEO GAME TUNE) Mama... Whassup? This new cool version of Daddy is even worse than the original! Word! In fact, I wish this whole family started acting normal again. I'm exhausted from staying up all night 'cause nobody's given me a curfew. That's for sure! The house is a mess because no one's making me do any chores! Bebe and Cece stink! And if I ever have to even look at another hot dog again, I'm gonna be sick! Go! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Mexican hotdogs? (GAGGING) (PENNY RETCHES) (LAUGHING) Hey, PC! How was the rehizzle for rizzle? Great! I was a big hit with the kids. And... oh, they even named a dance after me. ♪ Do the Oscar, Do the Oscar ♪ Do the Oscar, It's the Oscar "It's my birthday..." They kept saying that. (GROANS) (PENNY GASPS) How do? Cashew? What are you doing here? Oh... Just checkin' out your wardrobe. You know, you could use a little more variety. Okay. I stowed away on the boat and followed you here because I wanted to see what it was like to have a real family. Only problem is, you don't have a real family, either. Whatcha talkin' about, Cashew? Your real family's still back on the island being held captive. Those people downstairs are peanut clones sent here by the evil Dr. Marcus Garvey Carver... II... to find your father's secret formula so they can take over the world. Hey! Is this cashmere? Cashew... focus! Are you telling me my family is a forgery? (LAUGHING) Oh, that's funny! That's real funny. Come on, let's go downstairs so I can let everybody know you're here. (PENNY GIGGLING) You guys wouldn't believe who hitched a ride on the boat. Cashew! And he's got this ridiculous idea that all of you guys are clones! (PENNY GIGGLING) That is ridiculous... Right? BEBE: (DEEP VOICE) Yeah. That is ridiculous. Who said that? I did! Now, gimme the necklace or I'm gonna go upside your head with this 10-pound dirty diaper. See? I told ya. Oh... I get it. This is all a dream. Penny ate a bad hot dog, and now Penny's imagining things. Penny needs to go lie down, now. Get her! (SCREAMS) PENNY: Bebe! Let me go! I got it! (BEBE LAUGHING EVILLY) Oh! Gimme back my necklace, you fake Bebe! Come on, Cece. We gotta go! Take us home! Mission accomplished! Goodbye. See you, baby. BEBE: We got it! Come on, Cashew. I've gotta save my family. And you're gonna help me. Let's do this. DR. CARVER II: Good news! Your clones have located the secret formula. They're returning to the island at any minute... Just in time to see your demise. Carvey, how could you do this? What about the other night in the hot tub? Didn't that mean anything to you? (GROANS) Ugh! Mama! You and Carver? Yeah, we was in the hot tub together. What you got to do with it? And he gonna be your step-daddy. How you like that? That's just straight-up nasty! And then I said, "That's ridiculous, right?" And then they said, "No more games." Then I said, "Penny's dreaming!" And then they said, "Get her!" And then they took my necklace, and then they got into a helicopter and took off for the island! Proud, that's the whackiest story I've ever heard! People made from peanuts? (LAUGHTER) How do? (ALL SCREAMING) So, you believe me now? (SILENCE) Aw, he's actually kinda cute. I could just dip ya in some chocolate and eat you right up, you so cute! Look, y'all, I've gotta get back to that island and save my family! Well, if you goin', we goin', too. You guys would do that for me? We're your best friends, Penny. That means we're like family! So, if your family is in trouble, then doggone it, our family is in trouble! Can I get an amen? Such a dork. Oh, thanks, guys! Now, if we only knew someone with a really fast boat... Hold it! Nuh-uh! No way! I am not doin' that! Ah! Don't touch anything! If 15 finds out I stole his yacht, I'll be kicked outta his entourage. Sticky, it's pronounced yacht. Yetch, yacht... they both boats, okay, girl? PENNY: All hands on deck! Operation Family Liberation is a go. NUBIA: Uh... You're not going anywhere, Proud. Nubia, I don't have time to trip with you right now. I don't care. 15 Cent paid us to guard his boat. So if you want it... You gotta match his offer. Cough up the cabbage. Fine. You want my money, go ahead and take it. It's in my backpack. How do? (SCREAMING) (SPLASH) Punch it, Proud! Bye, Nubia! It's on, now! And now the time has come to reveal my crowning achievement... My masterpieces! It can't be! Are those... BOTH: Genetically engineered Supergenomes. But I abandoned my research on the agriculturally engineered supersoldiers years ago. I could never get them to stabilize. Neither could I. But if my hunch is correct, Oscar Proud's everlasting multiplying formula will certainly change that. Peanuts. (LAUGHING EVILLY) They've multiplied... They've stabilized... I'm an evil genius!
