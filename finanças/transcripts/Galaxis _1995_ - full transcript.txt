[music playing] LORD TARKIN [VOICEOVER]: remember the day my father died, the last glimmer of light flickering in his tired eyes as the enemy attack craft thundered overhead. Then I became the ruler, and the people looked to me and the powerof the sacred crystal to lead them to victory andthe peace they had once known. Many years have passed since then, but we have known no peace. Kyla drove us from our homes. Hunted and slaughtered, we fought to lay across the crumblingempire to our final refuge, the planet Centaria. [music playing] [weapons firing] [music playing] [ship exploding] Lord Tarkin, we've lost both forward squadrons. The eastern laser shield has been disengaged. Their landing vehicles are pouring through. Get the people back to the bunkers. Their ground troops will be here any moment. They're already on the perimeter wall, sir, massacring our men. Somehow, they slippedthrough the tracking shields and caught us by surprise. [explosion] [panicked screaming] [inaudible] and activatethe final shields now. Come on! [music playing] SOLDIER: Get ready! Gunners, move up! [weapons firing] [explosion] [panicked screaming] Flank guards, forward! Inside. [weapons firing] SOLDIER: Watch your back. SOLDIER: They're coming in! [explosions] [music playing] Kyla! [refugees weeping] You're safe now. Thank you, Lord Tarkin. Help is on its way. It will be over soon. Lord Tarkin, we're trapped here, aren't we? I mean, he's got us cornered,but we don't stand a chance? I don't see how you-- Don't you have a job to do? Yes. Do it. SOLDIER: Lord Tarkin. LORD TARKIN: You have news? I'm afraid it's not good, sir. All outer guns are inoperative. Defense shield 3, 5, and 9 are out. The army is all but destroyed,the fleet, annihilated. Once the people are back inside the bunker, activate the final shield. That should hold them out tillthe coalition fleet arrives. The enemy ground troops arepassed the defense shields. They are advancingswiftly onto the bunkers. And Ladera? What news from her? I'm sorry, sir. She was last seen in the eastern quadrant. But the troops there were massacred. They didn't stand a chance. I'm afraid she probably-- Stop. She still lives. My lord, we must close the bunker doors, now. Do it. [music playing] [weapons firing] Ladera. The bunkers. SOLDIER: Incoming! [weapons firing] [explosions] [weapon firing] [electricity crackling] [ship exploding] That was close. Activate perimeter shields. Let's hop the fleet makes it in time. This is only another forward scout party. I'm picking up signals from the main fleet. They're on the edge of the alpha sector. Shall I recontact the coalition fleet, sir? How far away are they now? Still two days at least. Get me the high commander on comms. I'm afraid we've got another problem, sir. They've jammed allintergalactic transmissions. The best we could do now issend out a distress signal. Why don't we talk to Kyla? I mean, let's face thefacts, Tarkin, We're beaten. You're beaten. You lost it. You lost it for all of us. You know the coalition fleet,by the time they get here, we're going to be smoking carcasses. You know, you're a real big hero, and that's all well and good,but don't risk our lives. Now, look, we don't have to die. We can make a deal. What does he want? The crystal. Well, let's give it to him. Silence. Two years Kyla has wreakedhavoc and destruction upon our colony. Many have died. Our homes are in ruins andour children are starving. But we shall never surrender,and we shall never make a deal with the likes of him. Peace with Kyla would be a lifedestined to slavery and misery. Without the crystal, we are nothing. It is the soul of our culture,the antithesis of our ways. Its power has guided and protected us since the dawn of time. It is more than a sacred relic or-- or a source of energy. It is as integral to our lives as air and water. If Kyla and his army ever possess it, the entire solar system will be at his mercy. Now, we cannot and will not surrender. Do I make myself clear? Yes. [weapons firing] [music playing] This is a restricted area, son. [machinery whirring] SOLDIER: Cyborg! Cyborg! [weapons firing] What is it? Something's happening in the main hall. [wall exploding] [weapons firing] [groaning] Hey, I can help you. Y-- yes. I can-- I knew you could bespoken to and talked with. I can offer you things. So you want to make a deal? Yes. Let me see. What do you think? Ugh! I guess not. My Lord Tarkin, I dohope I'm not interrupting anything important. That's right. Resistance is futile. It is over. I have won. Maybe next time. At last. [screaming] Go get help quickly! Right away. Ladera, beautiful sister. Shh. Be still. Why didn't you fight back? To make him believe he had won everything. But without the crystal and its power, we can only hold them back for two more days, and then we are doomed. Listen to me, Ladera, thereis something I haven't told you. There is another crystal. Another? When the crystal was created, another was made for a time like this. What do you mean? The scrolls tell of a distant planet, great [inaudible] keeper. Follow your heart. Tarkin, don't leave me. Don't leave me. You're the leader now. But beware, Kyla may follow you. If we were to get both fire crystals, the very fabric of life andtime would be in danger. Well-- No. No! [thunder cracks] Jed? It really is you? Manny, thanks for coming down. It's good to see you. Look at you. I missed you, boy. I was just telling mynephew Raymond how much-- remember Raymond? Yeah, I remember that deadbeat. What's he doing back in town? Now, Jed-- You didn't let him move back in, did you? He was just going through something. I don't know. And no, he's not living with me anymore. You threw him out? What did he do, max out your credit cards? Sell the family silver? Jed, be nice. Hey, what's with all thiscloak and dagger routine? You-- you join the FBI or something? You do something illegal? Look, it's nothing like that. Trust me. Just, well, I got a few complications. I'm all ears. Some people are looking forme and something I've got. If they find it, I'm dead. No biggie. Oh, Jed what did you get your ass into, huh? I thought you were down in Peru doing something useful with your life. I was. I got it, Manny. I finally got it. What you got? The Eye of the Incas. No. I thought that was just somekind of myth or something. Yeah, I know. My grandfather used to talk to me about it, about some long lost power source, a magical stone lost in the Andes, hidden by some ancient tribe. He was right, Manny. He was really right. Let me see it. [thunder cracks] Ancient tribes worshipped it. People feared it. And they believed it had the power to level cities and build empires. They even believed it wasn't of this world. Oh, it's incredible. I'm feeling almost kind of light-headed. Can I touch it? No! That's not a good idea. It does strange things to you. Four years of searching,four years of dead ends and-- and closed doors. And then suddenly, out ofthe blue, there it was. Hey, Manny, there isn't amuseum in the world who wouldn't give me a fortune for this. I've just got a couple of problems, though. That's why I need your help. Here I am. Take the Eye away from me. Hold it for a couple of weeks. When the dust settles, I'll call you. It's done. You and me, we go back a long way. Now, I promised your fatherI would look after you and look at yourself. You look like you haven't sleptin a bed in the last month. And that alcohol you put in your body is gonna put you in early grave. Now, I feel like I let your father down. OK, OK, I get your point. Manny, you're my family. I owe you big time for this. Hey, it's me. It's covered. Thanks, Manny. You OK? You look as if you coulddo with a long, hard drink. Well, that's the bestproposition I've had all day. [screaming] No, help! Shut up, bitch! Shut up, I said! [groaning] [burps] Woo! You do it now, babycakes. Prove it. [chuckling] Uh-oh. I-- I don't care too much for fighting. I'll buy you a drink No. Why? [inaudible] [chuckling] You know, a simple no would have sufficed. You got a visitor. Hello, Jed. Fancy seeing you here. I didn't realize you were back in town. I was still waiting for my postcard. Victor, nice to see you. I was-- I was gonna call you tomorrow. Of course you were. [chuckling] - Lose 'em. - You heard him. Everybody out. Let's go. Beat it, grandpa! Ah, you're hurting me! Let me go! No one tells VictorMenendez what to do, no one! You understand that? Ugh, ugh! Boy, you two like girlfriend boyfriend? Don't screw with me, Sanders! I lent you a great deal ofmoney, and it's payback time. Now, a little bird tells me you brought something real special back with you. Where is it? Special? That's-- that's a tricky one. Could you be more specific? Yes. [chuckling] Yes, I could. When the counter reaches zero, no more hero. [chuckling] In fact, you're gonna needa goddamn Thomas Guide to piece you back together. [chuckling] Shut up! OK. OK, well, um, let me think. Uh-- well, there was some-- some duty-free aftershaveand some t-shirts. There was some gum. End of the line, Sanders. "Manny Hopkins." I'll send him your regards. Better still, I'll send him to you see, so you can do it personally. Hey, we're closed! Come back tomorrow. You deaf, honey? I said, beat it! Kinky. Ugh! The fire crystal, I've come for it. Get her outta here! Ugh! I know it was here. Ugh! Ugh! You're dead, girl! [screaming] [beeping] Shit! [muffled speech] Oh, Christ. We gotta get outta here. Come on, this whole place is gonna blow. [beeping] Are you coming? Crystal, where is it? Lady, I'm not joking! [beeping] [mumbling] Whoa! It wasn't there. Where has it gone? What the hell? Are you out of your mind? Tell me now. Jesus, lady! What's this? Some kind of storm? I guess you could say that. Manny. [helicopter blades spinning] [siren wailing] OK, get me the bomb squadforensic and a full incident report from the fire force. Gentlemen, I want you to getme statements from every man, woman, and child who evenbroke wind near this bar in the last 24 hours. You get that? - Yeah, I got it. You get it? Good. Goddamn. Look, this is a brand newsuit my wife's gonna kill me. Lemon juice and baking soda. What? You mix it all togetherand the stain will come out. How do you know that shit? We women are born knowing that shit. What I can't figure is what Victor Menendez is doing on this side of town. This dump ain't his style. Maybe he was thirsty. Yeah, maybe. Where are the bodies? No bodies. I see bullet holes, blood,high powered explosives. I expect to see at least one casualty. I mean, why else are you gonnablow up the whole building? I know. Checked all the hospitals. So far, nothing. The bar lady? Oh, she didn't see anything. She left her glasses at home. Uh-huh, right next toher hearing aid, no doubt. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. - Hey, Carter. - Hey, Cap. What's up? Yeah, lookie here. "Jed Sanders." You ever heard of him? No, he's not one of Victor's. Oh. - What is that? It looks like Monopoly money. Well, looks like Mr. Sanders just got back from South America. This is Peruvian. Ah, a nice little suntan, some cheap wine. Hear the scenery'sstunning this time of year. Top it off with a few kilosof quiet marching powder. Beats Club Med. Let's run a check on our Mr. Sanders, see if the computer can comeup with anything interesting. OK. Oh, yeah. While you're at it, have the boys down at central put an APB out on him. I have a feeling our Mr.Sanders can shed a light on what went down here this evening. Yeah, if he's still alive. Look, lady. Thanks for what you did earlier. That was real impressive. I think the safest thing for usto do right now is to split up. I mean, those boys ain't gonnabe forgetting that in a hurry. What's your name? Jed. Jed. earlier, the crystal was in that room. I must find it, and youwill tell me where it went. Listen, lady, I don't have time for this. I have a friend of mine who'sin very serious trouble. [thunder cracks] OK, where do you live? I'll give you money for a taxi. I'm from Sintaria. Where's that? Somewhere in the valley? They had my wallet. Jed, you must help me. If I don't bring back that crystal, my people will be destroyed. This is our last hope. Boy. [thunder rumbling] [electric crackling] Yeah, all right. All right. Yes, sign right here this statement. No, no, no. That's a big help. Thanks. OK, here's what we got so far. According to a couple of friends of mine, Victor's collecting alittle debt from Sanders. Something goes totally wrong. Sanders and some accomplicejump Victor and his boys. Now the streets are buzzing. Word is, Victor's got a hit out on Sanders. Looks like our boy is as good as dead. Anything on the accomplice? Yeah, blonde and female. A blonde female in California? Well, that narrows it downto four million and change. That's real good police work. Over 6 feet tall and dressed like Barbarella? Jesus. What the hell are you doing here? I told you to go home. You are now in a lot of danger. Do not go into this place. I know he's here. Who's here? What the hell are you dribbling about now? Kyla has arrived! Kyla's arrived? How nice for him. Look, lady. Ladera. Ladera, Victor is not thekind of man you wanna mess with. Now, I suggest you just disappear. Look, I'm not joking. Now, get lost before you get us both killed. Looks like our friend spendsa lot of time in South America. Some kind of import-exportguy, mostly ancient artifacts. Any link to Victor? No, I do not have any information. Goddamn it. I mean, how is it every time we even get close enough to smell Victor or his mob, they manage to slip away? I don't know. I am sick of watching that little lowlife scumbag squirm his wayout of another situation. Listen to this. The Peruvian government'sbeen watching this guy for the last couple of years. And all of a sudden, he ups and takes off after a 16-month trip. I think this means something. Do you think this means something? I think we better find Sanders and his girl before Victor and his boys do. Mm-hm. We're gonna nail Victor'sass to the wall this time. No more lawyers, no more fast talk, no more sniveling his way out of it. He's going down permanently this time. I got an address on a guy named Hopkins. You coming? Hey, can I have a goddamnmoment here, please? Damn. Manny? Manny? Manny? That you? Manny? It's only me. The crystal, give it to me. I don't know what thehell you're talking about! Give it to me! Kyla, no! Big mistake. You're right! Come on! Come on! [screaming] Come on. Wait a minute. Get in. [screaming] Hold on a goddamn minute. What the hell happened back there? Those weapons? And that thing? And Manny? Jesus! It's not your fault, but we must go now. Kyla knows we're here! Kyla? Who the hell is this goddamn Kyla? Jed, I've been trying to tell you. Kyla is not from your world, and neither am I. This isn't happening. Jed. Jed, look. You have got to listen and to believe in me. Kyla is here for onething only-- the crystal. He'll stop at nothing, and I repeat to you, nothing to get it back. Jed, look, I'm truly sorry about your friend. I, too, have known a lossat the hands of Kyla. My friends, my family. [shouting] [laughter] And many thousands of my people. All because of the crystal? Legend says that when thestar system was created, so were the crystals. They are the pillars of life. They are the foundations of power. They are life itself. So it's not a myth. This guy, Kyla, what will he do with it? With the combined power ofboth, he'll become invincible. No one will be safe. No one! Kyla didn't just have it then, did he? So who does? I've got a pretty good idea. Come on. Bang! Oh, got an ID on the barbecue. Manny Hopkins. He's either a very careless smoker or we've got us a murder 1. Jesus. What the hell is that? I don't know. God. Hate to meet the spider that made that thing. Agh! Damn, that's red hot. Hey, Lee. LEE: Yeah? Get a sample of this down to the lab. LEE: Yes, sir. Is that him? Yeah, that's Raymond. We get it now. Get him. Raymond, how's it going? Jed, how you doing? Is there a problem? Couple. First, you're peeing on your shoes. Second, you've got somethingthat belongs to me, a box about this big. Jed, I don't know what you'retalking about, I swear to God. Ugh! God! Enough talk. The crystal. I-- I don't have it, I swear! Help! [gunfire] Please don't let them kill me, please! Enough! [screaming] Ugh! Ow. Ugh. Jed, grab the bag and run. Use this to protect yourself against Kyle. How pitiful! You led me straight to the second crystal. What a fitting ending. Yet I'd hate for you to miss all the fun. While you were away, My dogs of war have so much enjoyed the generous and plentiful hospitality of your planet and the people. Did you really think you could outsmart me? How arrogant! How foolish! You know, I think I couldrather get to like it here. A shame you gotta leave, then. [siren wailing] Police, freeze! Get down on the ground withyour hands behind your heads. I said, get down! You didn't say "please." Fire! [gunfire] Ladera: Jed, where are you? It's me. Jed? It's only me. Are you OK? Yeah, I took care of him. Now it's only you and me. Jed, I want you. What are you talking about? This isn't the time. Jed, you've got nothingto worry about, my daddy. I'm here now. [laughter] You are more elusivethan I gave you credit for. [groaning] The Sintarian led me to your friend. He screamed so loudly. So much pain. So much blood. Where is it? Tell me now! I-- I don't have it. Last chance. For my brother! You killed him. Where the hell did his body go? He's not dead. Mortal wounds alone cannot destroy him. We must find the crystal quickly. Are you telling me he's still alive? Very much so. Geez, this is too weird. Well, well, well. What is that? Shoe selling business is paying a little too well these days. Real deal. Come on. You say there was a girl and a guy, right? Yes. Now, once again, the girl,she was blonde, over six foot, and she was dressed like a Neo Gothic surfer? That's her. She's crazy, insane! She's got guns and-- and strange powers, man. Look, I'm telling you, something ain't right. Well, this is a beautiful story. Where were they headed, and whywere they interested in you? I don't know. I'm innocent. I didn't do anything wrong! Of course you're innocent.I'm innocent. You innocent? Are y'all innocent? Yeah. We're all innocent! All right. Now, this man who startedall the fires, where does he fit into all this? [sobbing] Hey, man, don't-- don't do that. [sobbing] This is gonna be a long night. Right, now listen to me. This is Chinese gangland here. So don't do any outer space stuff, OK? Let me do the talking. These are-- these are friends. [speaking chinese] Sanders, what are you doing here? Word is, you're [inaudible]. Rumors. Yeah? I hear there's a [inaudible]on your head tonight. All right, take it easy, big fella. I should off you right now. I'd make some money off your sorry ass. [groaning] Nice friends. Well, it was just a slight misunderstanding. Wait here. I'll be just a minute. Several [speaking chinese] [laughter] Geez. Beginner's luck, eh? I'll say. OK. Mind if I sit-in on this one? [laughter] What are you talking about, Jed Sanders? When have you ever had any money? Well, Mr. Sanders, you'vebeen a very busy man tonight. You wanna talk or you wanna play? Sit down. Hey, hey, hey. Watch the plastic. You'll leave a ring on it. Couldn't leave ring on thatwith a goddamn blow torch. No, no, no. You do not understand. This is a brand new car. This car belongs to my wife. This car has so much as ading in it tomorrow morning, I might as well move in the station house. [music playing] Hey, move! High stakes, boy. Match 'em. [snaps fingers] Let's see them. Hm. You first. Had a royal flush, Jed? [gunshots] [gunshots] [shouting] [gunshots] MAN [ON RADIO]: All units,we have an 811 in progress at 327 South Parlor. Suspects believed to be Sanders and accomplice. [shouting] [gunshots] Looking for this? You got a big mouth, funny boy. Not a good idea. [electric crackle] [screaming] Mr. Sanders. You mind if I trouble you witha couple of quick questions? Well, as long as they're quick. They're telling you what? I don't believe this. These two went on a personalcrusade through this town last night. I've got a list ofincidents longer than Prince Charles's cellular phone bill. Now, I want some answers. I want 'em now. All right, you-- you gotta calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. The DA's office is screaming for blood, and the damn press is having a field day. Now, do we have any leadson this figure in the alley? Or is he from outer space, too? I talked to the guys on the scene, OK? They said they got at least a dozen shots off and he just kept on going. Well, he's got some kind of Kevlar vest. Or-- or they're lousy shots. So what? No, I don't think so. Did you read the reports? Yes, yes. I read the report. Well, if you look atseveral of the incidents, the perpetrator, see? It's a match. So these two loonies, they know him, too? The woman said that he's the leader of an alien rebel force out to destroy the powers of the universe. Wonderful. Thank you, Kelly, for this-- this great insight. Now at least I know what I'm up against. I think I should go help Carter. All right. No, on second thought, I'll go with you. I gotta hear some of this shit. [chuckling] That's gotta be the biggestload of horseshit I ever heard. Look, I know how this must sound, but I'm telling you the truth. No, you're telling me some bullshit episode of "Star Trek," son. Now, I wanna hear the truth. And I wanna hear it now. I've told you already. How many times do I haveto repeat the same story? Until I'm satisfied, OK? Well, I think I have some rights here. You'll get your rights. Don't worry. And you're gonna have 30years to think about 'em. Well, there isn't nothing I can say that doesn't make me sound like a nut. Try me, Mr. Sanders. I am a very patient man. OK. I found the crystal in Peru. It's an ancient artifact,almost mythical. It's called the Eye of the Inca. I'd been looking for it for years. Victor lent me money. Victor, Victor? There's another strange piece of the puzzle. We've been after him for years. Now, what do you know about his organization? Well, I know he's no saint. That's common knowledge. But all I did was borrow money. Now, listen to me, son. You gotta start being a littlemore cooperative, or else it's gonna be a long timebefore you see the light of day. Now, am I making myself clear? I didn't do anything wrong! Nothing wrong? Let me see. Breaking and entering, grandtheft, resisting arrest, property damage, murder! Shall I go on? [siren wailing] So what do you think? Seems rational enough, but what a story. But the funny thing isthat their stories match. What's funny about that? Well, I don't know. They're both so-- socomplicated and extensive. You'd think one or the other would slip up. [phone ringing] So what the hell is this thing, anyway? Nobody knows. It sure caused a lot of trouble. So she beamed on down like Captain Kirk? Well, yeah. Yeah, well, the way Isee it, you and this bimbo murdered Manny to getyour hands on this thing. We didn't murder Manny. I loved him! He was like a father to me. I keep telling you, it was this guy, Kyla. That's funny. Some guy says he saw you entering the warehouse around theexact same time of his death. A witness? Some guy saw you and Miss America entering and then fleeingthe scene in a stolen pickup. Well, then, he told you about Kyla. I mean, he was there. He attacked us. Guy must have seen it. He's on his way over here now. We'll see. Let's go. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, pal, get to the back of the line. Agh! [screaming] Look, as long as that crystal's in here, we're all in more troublethan your worst nightmare. Sit your ass down! JED: You have no ideawhat you're dealing with. If he gets in here, we're all gonna be dead! Enough! I don't wanna hear no moreabout no goddamn spacemen or distant planets! The clock's ticking, son! And your time is up! [alarm wailing] Something's going down here. I got it. LADERA: Jed, come on! [screaming] [siren wailing] Get in. They got the crystal. Let's get outta here! I hope you know what you're doing. No, but there's a first time for everything. What happened to Kyla? I don't know, but hewon't give up that easily. Get 'em! [gunshots] He's coming around. Shit! [gunfire] Wait, wait! [chuckling] Get the stone and let's get outta here. There ain't nothing left in there, boss. Trust me. Do it! Boss, they're gone. That's impossible! He's telling the truth. There's no bodies in there. No! Sanders! I know you're here, and I know you got it! Sanders, give it up now andI'll let you and the girl live! Come on, now. I'm a reasonable man. You can trust me. Do you hear me? I said, do you hear me? You lousy son of a bitch! Find them and kill them both. Dre. Dre, was that you? MAN [ON RADIO]: Checkedeverything on the south side and level 1, up and down. Good. Keep in touch. If you find them, don't be a hero. Call for backup. [gunshots] Jed, run, run! Who's firing? Who just fired? Goddamn it, answer me! Jed! Seth, Dre! Come back. Somebody talk to me! Shit, brainless morons. Where were they last? They're on the first floor. Go find them. Before I kill them myself. Rock and roll. Sarge, we got two more in here. Sweet Jesus. What on earth could have done this? We've got a sighting, 4rd and Industry. Are you all right? Yes, sir. Go get 'em. Notify SWAT and Air. Call an attack alert. My order. Go. OK. It's time to finish this. [helicopter blades spinning] Does that tell you when you have to leave? Yeah, when this readout hitszero, the timeline will reopen. And that's when I must return. Well, at least you got what you came for. Yeah. Jed, I really want tothank you for everything. The people of Sintaria owe you their lives. And for that, I will never forget you. Thanks. What was that? Don't even think about it. Now, give me the stone, oryour boyfriend's history. Now. Lady, I ain't kidding around here. The stone. Put it on the ground and back away. [chuckling] Damn. Damn it! Pick it up. Go. "I don't like fighting." You better get used to it. [screaming] MAN: Oh, no! What? MAN: No! [gunshots] Who in the hell is firing now? Talk to me! You really caused me someproblems, Mr. Sanders. So now I'm gonna enjoy watching you die. Then I'm gonna find thatpsycho girlfriend of yours and cut her heart out. It's a shame you won't be around to see it. STAVROS [ON RADIO]: Boss,something weird's going on. They're all dead. What are you talking about? Who's all dead? Seth. Something or somebody ripped his face off. What? Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. He's laying right in front of me, man! VICTOR [ON RADIO]: What inthe hell is going on here? It's that slut bitch girl. No, I don't think so, Boss. This-- this don't looklike the work of no woman. No man, either. Pull yourself together! Of course it was her! You saw what she did in the bar. I'm afraid you're wrong. Shut up! Now, Stavros, you're nota-scared of a woman, are you? Look, I think we should get outta here! You're really trying my patience here! It's that girl. Now, get her! I-- I don't like this. Something ain't right. Do it! "Do it." [gunshot] VICTOR [ON RADIO]: What's going on? It was nothing. Keep searching! "Keep searching." Looking for someone? Holy Christ! No! Stavros! What is it? Stavros, come back! Now do you believe me? You're trying to tell methat some guy after the stone just killed all my men? Well, it's a little morecomplicated than that, but yes. He's after me more than your men. They're just getting in his way. Getting in his way? I don't believe this bull! That girl. Well, she don't wantpeople getting in her way, maybe you can talk some sense into her. Now, if you wanna live,you do exactly what I say. Move. Stavros, Stavros! This is Carter. I'm on 3rd and Industry. Looks like we might have something. I'm going in to check it out. Lady, I got your man here! Victor, listen. This guy plays for keeps. This is gonna do us any good except for getting us both killed. Shut up! I've heard enough. Now, call out her name. Do it! Forget it. That wasn't a multiple choice. Call her! Ladera, if you canhear me, he's not joking. Louder, like your life depended on it. Ladera! Freeze! Nobody move! Now, Victor! Back off, or I'll kill him. Drop the gun. I can't do that! Fine. Ugh! Last chance, bitch. If you ever wanna see him alive again! Time's up. I said I didn't care for fighting. There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Now, you were saying? Kyla, leave him! Well, well, well. The Sintarian has come backto rescue the wretched human! Forget him! Very well. Ugh! [thunder rumbles] I feel the timeline opening. You are too late. MAN: Freeze. Put the lady down or we'll open fire. It's over, Sintarian. Prepare to join your brother. MAN: Last warning. [gunshots] [screaming] Ladera? We have destroyed him. My people owe you everything. Now we can finally rebuildour worlds and live in peace. Why are you giving me this? You're now the keeper, Jed. Who knows? You may need it again someday. Jed, I must go. The timeline is closing. Your name will be legendary in our time. Will you ever come back? Who knows? One day. And I'll find you. Any last requests? [gunshot] [groaning] How in the hell am I gonna write this up? They'll lock me away. Look at my suit. Lime juice. What? Lime juice. Yeah, my-- my grandmother swore by it. Oh, Jesus.
