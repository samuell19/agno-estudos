Isn't this great? Look at that. Can you believe this? Look at that one. Marcia? Marcia, where are you? Marcia, is that you? Brenda? Stop it, Brenda. This isn't funny. Stop it. You're scaring me. Hey. Oh, man. Come on. Great. Jimmy, breakfast is ready. Come and get it. Don't even think about going to school dressed like that. And don't you dare say a word. I had a little trouble shaving. It's not that funny. To me it is. I meant what I said about those clothes. What? You know what. No, I don't. And if I did, I'm sure I could be of some assistance to you. The way you're dressed is what. You came by the raceway like that, half the guys would drive off the track. You are, of course, taking into consideration that those guys are all brain dead. Well, that might be, but the other brain's alive and kicking, if you know what I mean. Oh, I know what you mean. Do you? What? I don't just go to school to make grades. I also have to deal with being a woman, which I am. Even though you're about the only man alive who hasn't noticed it yet. You know, maybe if you went on a date every once in a while like normal people, you'd have more of a true understanding of such things. But we're not going to get into this right now, because I've got some great news, and I'm not going to let anything spoil it for me. What? Ready? I'm ready. Wanna take a guess? Gina, just tell me. I got accepted into the pre-med program. What? Let me see that. This is great. Gina, I'm so proud of you. You know Mom and Dad sure would be too. You really think so? Sure. uh-oh. What? I guess that means I better start making some more money. And you know what that means. - I do? Yep, I gotta get my ass to work. Look, you can wear the skirt, but lose the shoes, OK? High heels are out of the question. Come on, Jimmy. Out of the question, especially red ones. But red ones go with my outfit. All right, all right, I'll 86 the shoes. Hey, here's looking at you, kid. In the top of the clouds. Come on, man, let's go. We're gonna be late. Quit screaming. We got plenty of time. Oh, man. You all right, man? Shit. It's your fucking helmet, man, never leave home without it. Stop! What are you doing? Come on, let's go. Breakfast. Want some? It's pure protein. At 6:30 in the morning, pure insanity is more like it. Hold it, good buddy, just hold on. I'm your uncle. I ain't your little sister, so don't start treating me like her. What's wrong with the way I treat my sister? Come on, man, what's wring with the way I treat her? You treat her like a damn kid. Oh, bullshit. It's true, Jimbo. I'm tell you, your trouble is you don't go crazy. You don't date, you don't drink, you don't do nothing. You expect her to live the same way. Never happen. What the hell are you, our family counselor now? Listen, four wives and six kids, I'm telling you the way it is, my boy. Gina's 18-years-old. She needs to be out running around, getting laid. Oh, man, don't say that. It's true, Jimbo. I don't care if it's true, just don't say it. OK, I won't say it. Thanks. But it's true. Please, all the way around the race course, for your own safety, and the rules here at the Riverside International Raceway, you must be back 20 feet from the fence. You must remain 20 feet back from the fence with your cars, please. This is not only a rule here at Riverside, but it's for your own safety. chief. 400 horses under there, and 350 of them are out grazing. Come on, man, you'll have to do better than that. We sponsor... can win this race, he'll get us a real gig. Yeah, that's what I heard. That right? Yeah, they're gonna build a whole new fucking race track just for you. Race starts in two minutes. How about getting your sorry ass out on the track or get the hell out of here. One more time. One more time, I'm gonna ... that man hardly 20 minutes. Well, let's win the race first, all right? Then I can hit him? Hard as you want. Then, the pain got so bad, I couldn't even stay on the track. Was it like in a dream state? I don't know. I don't know, man, but it was weird. You think I outta see a doctor? - Shit. What for? Guy's gonna give you a pill, tell you to go to sleep for a couple of days, it'll cost you $100. I could teach him, three bucks a pop. You get a lot more kick in the ass than that store bought shit. Pop one of them, go to bed, get up in the morning a brand new man. - Stop the truck. - Why? Stop the truck? What is he doing? Hell of a time to go to a fair, ain't it, buddy? This is it. This is where it happened. A girl died in there last night. I saw it, man. I saw it happen. Slow down. Maybe you're just taking this thing just a little bit too far? You know what I mean? Hey, you got a quarter? Come on, man, you got-- shit. Jimmy? Jimmy, you all right? It was real, man. It was real. You got problems. Big problems. Mrs. Needlemyer, this is the seventh rape you've reported in less than two weeks. Mercy, me, isn't it just terrible? What's the world coming to, Sergeant? Don't ask me. OK, who did it this time, Mrs. Needlemyer? Well, of course, I can't be positive. He was wearing a mask, you know. But I'm pretty sure it was my neighbor Mr. Dettles. That's with two T's. Yes, ma'am. We'll get right on it. Thank you so much. Bye now. Bye bye. Oh my goodness, I almost forgot. I baked a fresh pound cake this morning, and I thought you could enjoy a slice with your coffee, Sergeant. Thank you very much, Mrs. Needlemyer. Now, don't forget, that with-- Two T's. I got it. Bye bye. Bye bye. Just another day at the desk, huh, Sarge? Hey, Gloria. How's the newspaper business? Shitty. Why don't you make it better and give me some thing juicy on the latest killings? Sorry, not a chance. Oh, come on. If I say a word, the captain will nail my nuts to that wall. Ouch. Good morning, Lieutenant. I wish. Hey, Bruce. Bruce? I need some help. Yeah, you and everybody else. Come on, give me a break. Hey, you give me a break. I got some nut out there running around like a raw nerve shooting girls. The Captain's about to blow a gasket. Bruce, just give me a couple of minutes and I'll get out of your hair. That's what you said when we got divorced too. That's not fair. Yeah. You're right. Listen, when I got something, I call ya. I'm glad you could make it. Sorry, sir. I got hung up in records. It's all right. What have you got there? This is it. Counting the two last night, we've got six dead bodies, all young females. No priors on any of them. I've bee over it and over it and over it. I can't find one thing that links them all together. What else? Well, I talked to this shrink down in metro, he's working up a new profile on the killer. He says it's going to be tough. One thing we got on this creep is he likes to shoot young girls in the face. Face. It's always the face. Maybe it has something to do with the eyes. We found this at the scene. So she wore shoes. Well, we didn't find the other way. Maybe the killer's got it in his car or his house or something. Maybe it's going to rain $100 at midnight... What good does that do us now? Being stuck behind this desk is driving me crazy. You know, he's out there. He's out there looking for another victim, and he's going to find one, and then he's going to find another, and another, until we stop him. Will get him, Captain. Oh, yeah. I want to tell you something, you turn that lunatic over to me, and I give you my word he'll never see the light of day again. You understand me? Understood, sir. Good. All right, let's go over this again. No, not a thing. Nobody's talking. ...everything. Yeah. Yeah. OK, this is the deal. I'm going to meet with the shrink in about an hour and see if I can get a different angle on this thing. No, I don't know what it's going to be. At this point, I'm just reaching at straws. Excuse me. I need to see somebody in charge. So does everybody, pal. What's your beef? It's about the murders last night at the carnival. I think I can help. You think? I saw it happen. Hold on. You may be just what the doctor ordered, pal. Follow me. I think I just found our angle. I'll tell you later. Come in. What is it, Sergeant? I got a guy out there says he witnessed the murder last night. Maybe we got a break after all. Don't just stand there, send him in. Yes, sir. I'm Lieutenant Ellis. This is Captain Gavin. And Your name? Clayton. Jimmy Clayton. Have a seat, Mr. Clayton. I understand you might be able to help us in our investigation. Yeah, I hope so. Well, why don't we start with just exactly what you saw. OK, um, I saw a girl running through a big room full of mirrors. And then? Then I saw somebody following her, chasing her, I think. Did you see a face? No. It was too dark. Just exactly what did you see, Mr. Clayton? Well, then I saw a gun go off. A shotgun, I think. You remember the exact time of this incident? Somewhere around 10:30. Coroner put the death at 12:40. The coroner isn't always right. Why didn't you call the police right then and there from the carnival? Well, I wasn't at the carnival. I was at work. Let's back this thing up. When you say you were at work 10:30 last night, let's start from there. No, not last night. This morning. I saw it at work 10:30 this morning. That's it. Get this man out of here. Wait a minute. Don't you want to hear the rest of it? I've heard all I want to hear, mister. Look, I'm telling you, I saw it happen. I got this pain in my head, and I saw it. One more word from you, I'm going to pick up the phone, and you're going to end up on the funny farm. But you're making a mistake. We've all made mistakes before. Where do they come from, Ellis? I don't know. I sure hope the news media don't get a hold of this. That's all we need. That's for sure. Sir, excuse me. Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions? Why? Well, I couldn't help but overhear-- You're a detective? Yes. No. Well, you might say I'm an investigator. - I'm through talking with you. - No. Please, wait-- Look, lady, do I have the word idiot stamped on my forehead or something? You people made a fool out of me once today. I'm not coming back for seconds, you got it? Please, just a minute to hear me out? Stop. I just want to hear what they have to say. That's all. Trust me. Come on, there's a little place around the corner. I'll buy you a cup of coffee, and we'll talk. What do you say? Come on? Sure. Thanks. Let me know if I can get you anything else. So anyway, to make a long story short, the pain got so bad, I couldn't stay on the track. This sort of thing has never happened to you before? Nope. No psychic episodes of any kind? No. I hope it doesn't happen again. It's very painful. But if it does, you might be able to solve the case .... I just want it to stop. I want the pain to get out of my head. That's all I want. Can we stop talking about this, all right? OK. Sure. You OK? Yeah. Look, I better be going. Wait a minute. I said I would take you for a cup of coffee. Jim, listen, I'd really like to talk to you some more about this. How about dinner tonight? My treat. No. I don't think that would be a good idea. I won't take no for an answer. 8 o'clock? Done. Good. I'll see you then. What a story. I don't know, Lori. I mean, I know he's really good looking and all that, but he's kind of a jerk, you know? No, I don't want to go out with a nice guy who's a nerd. I'd rather go out with a really nice guy who's really good looking. Yeah, I know, I know, but it doesn't hurt to wish. Here I come, ready or not. OK. OK, I'll see you then. I gotta go. Bye. Wow. What do you think? You look great. - You really think so? - Yeah. Turn around. Let me see. Oh, you look hot, Jimmy. I don't know who this chick is, but unless she's boring, you're going to drive her crazy. Well, let's not get carried away, sis. It's not exactly a date, you know. The way I see it, it's whatever you make it out to be. We'll see. Lori picking you up tonight? Yeah. In about a half hour. Well, I better scoot. Hey, remember to lock up, and be home at 12:00. I always lock up, and I'll be home by 1:00. 12:00. 1:00. 12:30? OK, 12:30. If you're home by 12:30, too. Deal. Are you sure? You look great. Now, go on, knock her dead. Sometimes, he acts like such a child. Tried and tried to get his ...,, but he couldn't do it. Damn. What did he do about it? Magnets in those pockets? You playing with steel balls, Blake. I got your steel balls, buddy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway, this palm reader tells him to do it blindfolded. - Blindfolded? - Yeah. Blindfolded so he'll... Yeah I done that before. Good old Suzie. You done it with Suzie? I done it with Suzie. Suzie? Blonde Suzie with the big-- Nah. It was a brunette Suzie. Flat chested. So then she tells him to do it blindfolded and nothing else on but his shoes. Then, she takes his hand, and she starts rubbing his little finger, like in little tiny circles. Wouldn't you? What? What are you deaf? He thinks he's going to lay right on the table, wouldn't you? Wait a minute, don't you want to hear the rest of the story? Later. Hey, pal. You want to hear a hell of a story? Hey, honey, bring me a beer, will you, please? there was this girl tried and tried to get his old lady pregnant, but couldn't do it. Have you heard this story? Hey, buddy, let me tell you something. Thank you. Hi, this is Gina. And this is Jimmy. Sorry, but we're not home right now. Gina's at the school dance, and Jimmy's out swinging his hammer in all the wrong directions. Gina. Leave us a message and we'll get back to you. Maybe. Or maybe not. Bye. That's my car you're digging in. Hey, pal, get yourself a drink. Oh, thanks, mister. I think I will. Mister? Anyone want to rent another car, I'm your man. You got it. I feel guilty. Like a teenager. I never thought I would do this on the first date. Me neither. Do you mean me or you? Both. You're not going to tell you're married or something, are you? You really think I'd bring you in my apartment if I was married? I I don't know. Stranger things have happened. The answer is no. How about you? Is there anybody special in your life? Married? No. Special. Yeah. Oh. Her name's Gina. 18-years-old, great legs. I can't compete with that, huh? Nobody can. She's my kid sister. the The most special thing in my life. That is maybe up until now. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel like a teenager. Here they are. Here they are. ... Shouldn't they come to us? Are you kidding? Didn't you see the other way the girls are looking at them? Come on. Hi, Kennie. How you doing, Lori? Looking pretty good. So are you. Um, Gina, this is Brad. Brad, this is Gina. Hi, Brad. I know you, don't I? Well, kind of. I mean, we're in chemistry together. Right. Right. I recognize your eyes. Let's slip outside, and do a little doobie. Great. I don't think that's a very good idea. Oh, come on, Gina. Everybody does it. Hey, that's cool. We'll just do it without her. Fine. Gina, come on. Oh, god, Lori. That's some good shit, bro. It's the best, man, shit. That's for sure. No, I don't want any. Come on, Gina. No. Go on. Come on, you guys. Come on. All right. Did you hear that? Don't get paranoid on us, Gina. She heard something. No, I don't want any. Come on, Gina. Don't worry. I'll see to them in the morning. Ken Mitchell, and let's see, that was Brad Felker, wasn't it? That was Mr. Felker, was it not? Yes, sir. Say, I'm quite disappointed in the both of you. Especially you, Gina. You've got a bright future. Don't throw it away. Now, this will not happen again, am I correct? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. See that it doesn't. That was close. Come on, let's go find the guys. Just forget it. I'm going home. Brad. That's not funny, Brad. You asshole. My god, you nearly scared me to death. I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping. I thought you were too. No such luck. What did you do to your hand? It's nothing. i dropped the knife in the dark, and picked it up on the wrong end. It's only a scratch. Why don't you come back to bed? Can't sleep. Got too much on my mind. The murders, or whatever they are. You. It's a lot to take all at one time. That's understandable. Listen, I better be going home. Give me a second to throw something on, and I'll give you a lift. Stay in bed. That's OK. I'll make it. Jimmy, you're welcome to stay. Thanks. But I really need time to think. Besides, Gina is probably worried about me. Jim? Jimmy, what is it? Jimmy, what's happening? Jimmy. Jim? No. No. Jimmy? Jimmy? Can you hear me? Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. OK. Let's go. What is it? Jimmy, what happened? Gina. It was Gina. Come on. Gina! Gina. Oh my god. Come on, Jimmy. Come on. Sit down. It's gonna be OK. It's going to be OK. No, it's not. So what in the hell are you doing here? Try and show a little compassion, will you, Bruce. That was his sister. His sister? Yeah, his sister. Gina Clayton. Well, Gloria, I think you've got your wires crossed again. That's not Gina Clayton. That's Lori Ann Cline. What? Lori Ann Cline. Where's Gina? Where's my sister? Hey, back off, pal. Right over there in my car. Gina. Oh my god, Jimmy, it was horrible. Sh. Lori's dead. It's OK. She's dead. It's OK. It's OK. Come on. Let's get out of here. Hey, where the hell you think you're going? I'm taking her home. I'm not done questioning her yet. I'm taking her home. So you found another way to get your stories, huh, Gloria? That's ugly, Bruce. Very ugly. I just call them as I see them. Once a cop, always a cop. You got it. No. I had it. I got rid of it. What do you want? I know who you are. I want you to leave Jimmy alone. He's had enough pain in his life, so just stay away. Should I take that as a threat? Take it anyway you want it, lady. Just take it. Don't tell me. 7 murders in 14 days, and we haven't got a clue, right? Wrong. What do you mean wrong? I've got a partial license plate number for a vehicle leaving the scene. Teacher over at the school. Is that all? That's it for now. I'm running it, but you know about partials. Could take hours, could take days. Don't remind me. What about that Clayton girl? She was there. She must seen something. She was found unconscious. Says she remembers a gun blast, but she doesn't remember a face. Figures. Come in. You realize it's 3:30 in the morning, Captain? Well, I thank you for that information, Belker. Now, perhaps you can get me some information for possibly for changing this case. Have a look. I can't read this. What is it? What it says, Captain, is that this is a classic case of object induced dream state psychotic dysfunction. What the hell is that supposed to mean? This is guy that you're after, he keeps taking things from the victims, right? High-heeled shoes, pieces of jewelry, small items of clothing. See, this guy looks at an object and it's somehow connects in his subconscious and pow, elimination of the person connected with that object. Namely murder. It's insane, but it's still premeditated. Just a minute, what you're trying to tell me is that this nut gets locked into something, and then sniffs out his victim like a hound dog. Correct. Crudely put, but correct. I preferred to refer to this person as someone suffering from maladaptation and socially dysfunctional traits. You know, I didn't call you in here to get an education. OK, Captain, OK. Just what is it you want from me? I want a list of all the people in the city in this state that has a modus operandi anything near that profile of yours. And I want a follow up that might give me some idea when this maniac might strike again. I'll get on it at first daylight. No. You'll get on it right now. I should have been a dentist. I should have been a florist. Well, I like flowers. Hey, you awake? Sort of. Come on, get up. I brought you breakfast. Breakfast in bed. Thanks. You OK? I guess so. What time is it? I've got to get to school. There's no school for you today. Jimmy, I have to go to school. I have finals. I talked to your principal. He's going to let you make up finals next week. I guess you really did thank of everything. Hey, what are big brothers for? Now, eat. I gotta go clean the kitchen. Here's looking at you, kid. From the top of the clouds. Morning, Lieutenant. Captain? Yeah? Captain, you've been here all night? Yes, I have. Want me to get you some coffee? No. I don't want any coffee. Here, sit down. Now, the good doctor gave us his new profile. We've spent the last four hours going over it. Come up with anything? Five possibilities. There's one you might find very interesting. I'll be damned. Yeah. Did you get anything on that license plate yet? Still waiting. Don't wait. Get out on the street, and try to find that character and bring him in. I'm on my way. One thing. Yeah? What led you in this direction? A hunch. A hunch? Hell, I wish I could come up with hunches like that. When you do, you'll be captain. Go on. All right, I'm coming. Coming. Didn't I tell you, Jimmy ...?? Didn't I tell you not to talk to anybody? It's nice to see you too, but what the hell are you talking about? Didn't I tell you not to talk to the police in the first place, huh? Didn't I tell you to keep it to yourself? It was good advice, Jimmy. You should have taken it. - What? This. And that ain't all, amigo, look at who wrote the thing. Shit. I thought she was a cop. Well, Bubba, now the whole city thinks you're a fruitcake. Jimmy, it's not what you think. It's really not. Oh, no, then what exactly is it? I had to print the story. It's my job. You lied to me. No, I didn't lie. Now, I told you that I was an investigator, and that was the truth. Truth? What the hell do you know about the truth? Would you just please let me explain everything? I don't want to hear your explanation. Then why did you come here? Good point. Jimmy, please let me explain. I didn't want it to happen this way. I really didn't. OK, I was after a story at first. I admit that. But then it changed. I care about you. Please, believe me. Jimmy. Stop. I slept with you because I wanted to. You used me. You lied to me, and you used me. It was my fault. I should have known better. God damn it, I should have known better. I don't know how you live with yourself, Gloria, but whatever it takes, I hope this was worth it. You're not listening to me, Jimmy. I tried to dump the story, but my editor wouldn't let me. It was the story or my job. Well, take your job, and your story and sleep with them tonight. Damn it. Gloria? Great. Get in this car. No chance, buster. Gloria. Get your sweet butt in this car right now, or I'll put you under arrest. For what? For anything I damn well please. You wouldn't dare. You try me. Now, get in the car. Now. OK, Bruce, what is this all about? I'm sorry about the rough stuff, but I had to talk to you. It's really important. We don't need to go for a ride to talk. We do for this one. If the Captain knew I was talking to you, I'd be writing parking tickets for the next 10 years. Well, then, please, tell me what this is all about. I can't stand the suspense. Jimmy Clayton. Damn you, Bruce. We've been divorced for three years. I'm going to go out with other men, whether you like it or not. So don't you sit there and lecture me with your sanctimonious bullshit, because I've heard it. Will you shut up and listen to me? I don't care if you go out with other men. Well, maybe I do, but that's not what this is about. I came here to warn you. Warn me? About what? Jimmy Clayton is our number one suspect in the face killings. What? If this is your idea of a joke, Bruce, it's a sick one. It's no joke. The department shrink's ran a profile on it. The computer spit him out as number one on the list. I don't believe this. Gloria, listen to me. Stay away from this character. He's trouble. His past bears it out. I want to hear about it. Off the record? Off the record. According to the report, Jimmy Clayton lists the classic pattern of a psycho. Doc says he may even have a split personality. He was an abused child, sexually abused, by his mother. Oh, no. Apparently, it had been going on for a number of years. One Day his father caught them in the act, killed his mother. He shot her in the face, then he turned the gun on himself. I guess the kid was about 14 at the time. He spent the next three years in a funny farm on the .... You getting the picture yet? Take me back. Yo got it. Listen to me, Gloria, we may not have the evidence on this guy yet, but we'll get it. Trust me. I got a real strong urge about this one. Lieutenant Ellis, please respond on tack 7. Lieutenant Ellis, response on tack 7, over. This is Ellis. What is it? That vehicle ID you were waiting for just came in. Only three possibilities, over. All right, let's have it. What are you doing here? Ain't that just like a reporter? Asking all the questions. I need to see Jimmy. That ain't possible. What'd you do to him? Question is, lady, what'd you do to him? Please, would you tell me where he is? It's very important. Just can't get enough, can you? Can I at least use the phone? Sorry, temporarily out of order. Right. Take some advice, reporter lady. Don't push your luck. Over here. You're Gloria, right? Yeah. You must be Gina. I've heard a lot about you. I've heard a lot about you too. Who is that crazy man in your house? Uncle Blake? Don't worry about him. He's harmless. You're in love with him, aren't you? I mean, Jimmy. I think so. I knew it. I just knew it. Listen, I think I know where you can find Jimmy. See, there's this place he likes to go whenever he wants to be alone. I'm sorry. I didn't know. The police-- the police think that you're the killer. That doesn't surprise me. Do you believe that? No. No, I don't. But they do. It doesn't matter what they think. She'll know. It's all going to come back now. All of it. From the past. The pain. I'm over it. She doesn't know how your parents died? She knows how her mother died. See, I'm her brother and her father. Jimmy. I guess it's time to go. Clayton. James Clayton. Stand up. Don't worry, Jimmy, I'll do everything that I can to help. Put your hands up behind your head, and step forward. Real easy. That's it. You're wasting your time. He didn't do it. We saw the truck leave the school last night. We've get a positive ID. A truck? Keep moving. I said, keep moving. Jim. Jimmy? What's he doing? Come out of it. What the hell's going on here? You got me. Come out of it, Jimmy. Jim? Get him up. It was Blake. What? It was Blake. Blake Garrett did it. I saw him. He's the one you want. Who is Blake? It's his uncle. Oh my god, he's with Gina. What? Blake is with Gina. He's going to kill her. You've got to let me go. Please, listen to him. Put him in the car. No. Get the hell out of the way, Gloria. No, Bruce. He's not running away. He's running home. Please, let me take you there. Let's go. Move it out. I want to know what happened to him back there. I want to know now. He was having a vision. Something about the murders, and he saw Blake Garrett. You believe that nonsense? I saw it happen last night, Captain. It's not nonsense. Go back. Go back, that was Jimmy. Can't do that. Why? Why are the police after Jimmy? You don't want to know. Go after them. Go after them, god damn it. He's got my sister. You're not listening to him. Don't worry. We'll pick them up. Wait a minute. Tickets. He had airline tickets. He's going to the airport. That's it. call it in. Follow me. Uncle Blake, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on. We're leaving the country, and I'll explain on the plane, OK? What about Jimmy? We can't wait. Come on. Freeze. See ya, kid. Blake. Go, go, get out of the way. There he is. Cut him off. There she is. There's Gina. I'll get her. Go. Gina, are you OK? What's going on? Oh, honey, don't worry. Everything is going to be OK. Stay on him. Better give up, Garrett. You got no place to go. I'm going to give you one minute, Garrett, to get out of there. If you don't, we're coming in to get you. Captain? Captain, let me talk to him. Come on. He'll listen to me. Take the cuffs off him. You gotta come with me, Blake. I don't think I'll be doing that. Come on, man, what the hell are you doing? What were you doing at the school last night? You really don't know, do ya? No. You know, the day your father died, he made me promise always look after you and Gina. That's the trouble with promises, sooner or later, you gotta pay up. Blake. Hold your fire. See ya, kid. Blake. I'll be damned. Hi, Gina. Oh, Gloria, you look hot. Do you think he'll like it? I think you're going to drive him crazy. I'm heading off to the movies, so you two can be alone. And I'm going to be very disappointed if you behave yourselves, understand? You're embarrassing me. And don't worry, I'll knock real loud before I come back in. Go on. Hi. Hello, Gloria. Aren't you going to tell me how great I look in my new outfit? I'm sure you look just fine. What is it, Jimmy? What's wrong? Just thinking about it all. Look, I know that this has all been terrible, but you have to let go of it. It's all over now. I don't think so. Why would you say that? I know Blake didn't do it. Jim, of course, Blake did it. The police found all the evidence in the apartment, including the murder weapon. He set it up that way. He was just covering. What? Covering for who? Billy. Billy? Billy's the one who started it all. I never slept with my mother, he did. He's the one who's been doing all the killings. Blake's the real snake. He knew it was Billy all along. He's just trying to cover up. I'm sorry, Jimmy, but I don't-- I don't understand. Who is Billy? I'm Billy. Jimmy. Jim. Jimmy's not here anymore. And he won't be coming back. Jimmy, no. I'm Billy. Don't you understand that? Jimmy is hiding. Jimmy always hides when things go wrong. He couldn't take it when mother came in his room with her red high heels on. He couldn't take it when Gina was born. And he can't take it when it comes time for killing, so I do it for him. But I like it. Pretty good at it, don't you think? Getting better all the time. So tell me something, Gloria? What did you really see in Jimmy? Was it his boyish charm? His dashing good looks? Hm? Cat got your tongue? You should have went for a real man. Like me. I'm sorry I don't have a gun, Gloria. I'd really prefer to blow off your face, but we'll just have to make do. Bye bye now. Come on. Come on. Please answer the phone. Sorry, dead. Jimmy, don't do this. It's me, Gloria. Can you hear me? Jimmy, come out. You've got to stop Billy. Don't let him do this. It's not going to work. He's gone. Jimmy, I love you. I killed them. It's going to be OK. Fooled you, didn't I? Chop chop. You all right? Can't come back now, can he? How did you know? Just a hunch.
