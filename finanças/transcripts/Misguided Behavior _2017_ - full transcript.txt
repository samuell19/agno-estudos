Until now, you've heard mostly about the victims, but tonight, we'll also hear from the bullies themselves. - [Kevin] You catch that? Maybe you've heard it before. Like I read a Tweet that somewhere some kid was getting bullied and some kid died. It goes on. I'm one of those kids. I am the poster child for bully abuse.

Actually, makes you look tougher. [laughing] I kinda like that. My boy wants to play football, that's cool. Ain't gonna turn pro overnight, though. You gotta practice. - Yeah, practice makes perfect. - Maybe I'll take some time off of work. We can go to the park, throw the ball around, cool? - Yeah, I'd love that, yeah.

Now, what do you have to say for yourself? - I mean, I'm obviously just not the luckiest guy in the world. - Son, I'd suggest you take this very seriously. This is your third offense, and I don't think you're gonna be real happy with the repercussions. - What is it? Three days of after-school detention or as we like to call it, after-school lunching. [chuckling] - Oh no, Mr. Fields. You've abused all of your detention rights. I got something extra special in mind for you. - And what is this? - Three day out of school suspension. You've earned it well. - Sweet. Three days of vacation. What more could a kid ask for? [chuckling] - Is that right? I'm sure your father would disagree. [phone ringing] Yes, Mandy. Get me Mr. Fields on the phone. - Yeah. Please, get that done for me, okay? Alright, okay, thanks. Bye. Hey Miller. - [Michael] Yeah? - This came for you.

Makes me question the life I now have with Ben. He's so charming and the fact that he's my partner doesn't help, either. - We're out here risking our lives every day and then you gotta go home and act like nothing happened. - Yeah, Benjamin's the same way. He thinks cops are a liability. - [Child] Mommy, Mommy, can I have a lollipop? - No, baby. - [Child] Please, please? - I said no. - Here you go. - Thank you, I love this store! - All he talks about is his precious school. - There wouldn't be no schools if there weren't good cops out here doing their job.

[melancholy music] - Michael. - [Michael] Yeah, yeah. - What's this? - [Michael] Where'd you get that? - I found it in your laundry. - [Michael] Alright, well thank you. - Whose is it? - [Michael] Somebody left this at the station. I just picked it up. I thought it would be like a good luck charm. - I thought I was your good luck charm. - Baby, you are my good luck charm. I figured a little extra luck wouldn't hurt none. - So, how was work today? - It was good. Same old, same old, chasing down the bad guys and locking them up. - Lately that's been taking a lot of time. You know, I don't think this promotion of yours is gonna work. - I didn't even get promoted yet. Rogers just wants me to take on a little extra responsibility. Now, everything's gonna be fine. - Well, Captain or no Captain, Rogers is gonna have to let my husband come home for dinner sometimes. - How was dinner? - It was great. You know, I think you would have liked Kevin's new friend. He was a nice kid. - Where'd they meet? - At school. But you know, Kevin's just, he was uncomfortable when I started asking a lot of questions. He mentioned about that girl that lives down the street. - Who, Mrs. Winbrook's kid? - I think Kevin has a crush on her. - Way to go Kevin. She's cute. - Mmm. But you know, I just wonder why he was trying to hide it from us. - Aw, he just don't wanna be embarrassed, that's all. - Embarrassed? - Yeah. - Kevin is a good kid. And plus, any girl would be lucky to have my baby. - Man, that's right, 'cause he's my baby. - No, my baby. - That's my boy right there. - Alright. I know you're not going to sleep. - Come on. - Naw, nuh uh. Not tonight. - Long day, baby. - No, no, no. - Long day.

Give it back to him, Lance, this is serious. Stop it. This is not a joke. You guys, stop. How 'bout I tell Mr. Miller what you guys are doing over here? - Chill, man. Ain't no need to get the old folks involved. Oops. - [Kali] Give it back to him. - Alright, there. [excited chattering] - [Kali] Kevin, you okay? Just try to breathe, okay? I'm gonna go get help.

I shoulda known that something was going on at school. It's time, they just been pushing you. Been pushing you to be something that you're not. [mumbling] How could I have been so stupid? - Michael, this is not your fault. You're a good father. - Good father wouldn't have done this. Good father would not have let this happen. - Can't blame yourself for this. Things happen like this dealing with kids. - No they don't. Not like this. Not like this. [melancholy music] - Mr. Miller. Is Kevin gonna be okay? - Yeah, he's gonna be alright. Christopher, how you doin'? Christopher, do you know anything about what happened tonight? [tense music] - I wasn't there when everything happened, but... - But what? You can talk to me. [melancholy music] - When Kevin was getting in the ambulance I overheard kids talking, you know. - What they sayin'? - He said that Lance and his friends, Lance and his friends snuck in the festival, they didn't pay. - So what does that have to do with Kevin? - Lance has been out to get him since day one. - What are you talking about? Wait a minute. What do you mean out to get him? - He's the reason he has a black eye and everything. - Wait a minute. Kevin told me that he got hurt playing football. - No, it was Lance. [melancholy music] He wanted to make you proud. - Make me proud? - Lance is the reason we're all here. - Christopher. Do you know where this kid lives? [tense music] [tense music] [knocking] Hello? Local police. Anyone home? Mr. Fields. [knocking] Mr. Fields, I just wanna ask you a few questions about your son. - So, do you remember anything? Figures. You know, my uncle once passed out and T.G. couldn't remember anything, so... But, my parents thought that was a good idea 'cause there was some things he wouldn't want to remember, you know? - [Michael] Hello? [phone ringing] [tense music] - Kali keeps asking about you. She feels horrible about the whole thing, and she tried to stop Lance and the crew and I guess it was too late. Someone's gotta do something about this kid getting away with this stuff. I guess hero's don't exist in general life, but I bought you some things I knew that you'd like. I'll leave 'em here for you. Alright, gotta go.

Her so-called friend came and took photos of her naked, and then posted them on Snapchat. And over and over and over again on social media. Few hours later, she shot herself.

Today was just full of surprises, none that I would be proud of. The test results I got back from the lab are a match. Part of me has known this whole time and I desperately wanted to believe it was his. Now I don't know what to do. How am I gonna explain this? This could ruin my family. My son would grow up to despise me and my husband would hate me. I can't do it, he can never know. Michael can never know that Lance is his son. [melancholy music] - I gotta go.

Right there. Lucky bastard, I'm surprised he's still alive. - There's anybody in the house? - Naw, it was empty when I got here. The neighbors saw him out and decided to call it in. They said he's always doing something crazy. My guess is that he got drunk and fell over. Oh, yeah. Neighbors said that the wife died a long time ago, so it's just he and the kid living here now. I think his name is Logan. - It's Lance. Lance Fields. - You know him? - No, I knew the mother. [melancholy music] - [Jessica] Excuse me, I'm here for my son. - [Nurse] Name? - [Jessica] Kevin Miller, he's being discharged today. Can I just go get him? - I'm sorry ma'am. We have to call Patient Transport to get a wheelchair. - Is that necessary? - It's procedure, but if you want, you can bring your car around to the main entrance and meet him there. - Thanks, I will. - Oh, Mrs. Miller. - Your husband left this earlier sitting outside your son's room. - Oh. - Mrs. Miller? Hi, Dr. Wells. May I speak with you for a moment? He's been through a very traumatic event and in situations like this, feelings of self-doubt, remorse or even guilt are very common. - Guilty about what? - What happened to him is his fault, he somehow brought this upon himself. - That's ridiculous because it wasn't. - [Dr. Wells] I agree with you. What these are are issues that you may have to work through with Kevin and actually, I recommend some type of counseling or therapy. Keep in mind that we've healed his body, however, the real process begins afterwards. [tense music] - Miss Jenkins? - [Miss Jenkins] Yes, Stanley. - [Stanley] Could I go to the bathroom? - You know the rules, Stanley.
