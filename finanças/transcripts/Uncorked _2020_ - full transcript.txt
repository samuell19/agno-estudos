I got three rib tip sandwiches with slaw. Them collards done? Almost. They weren't cleaned good. Throw on some hickory while you're out there. Damn, he's sweaty. - Harold? - Yeah? You unpack them beef ribs? Yeah, they're done. You sure? The last thing I need is them fools from the mosque thinking I been sabotaging their movement with some pulled pork. Where's Elijah? And then I caught the nigga at Tops with another bitch. He cheated on me, like, eight times. Why I still mess with him? 'Cause you're stupid. I am. But that D... - was savage though. - Mm-mm. Girl, no. That's why your ass needs some drink. Hey... Yeah, you right. - I'm kidding, girl. - You okay? Yep, I... Excuse me. Where's your white wine? Uh, one aisle over. What... You looking for something specific? A... A good one? Don't laugh. I don't be knowing this. What? Okay, okay. Um... Here, follow me. Okay, uh... Wait, so... you like hip-hop? Yeah. Okay. So... First, we've got Chardonnay. Now, Chardonnay is like the granddaddy of wine. It's... It's versatile, smooth and can kind of go with anything. You know, it's like... It's like the Jay-Z of wine. - Okay. - Okay? Okay, so next we've got the Pinot Grigio. Uh, Pinot Grigio is a white wine, but with a little bit of spice to it. It's like, "Oh, you thought I was just a white wine? I'm about to get stupid." It's... It's like a Kanye West. So Pinot Grigio's gonna say slavery was a choice? It wasn't? And then, over here, uh... we've got the Rieslings. Now, Rieslings are crisp, clean, usually kind of sweet. So it's like the Drake of wine? Yeah, Rieslings be in their feelings. Okay. That was good. I've got to give it up. - You're about to give up something. - Bitch. I'll take a bottle of the Drake. Okay, uh... Well, uh, Thomas can ring you up. Okay. I fucks with Drake. Oh, shit!

How you know my ribs are done? You just got here. - Really? - What do you mean, "Really?" If you cut them too soon, I lose money. If I lose money, I can't take your mama to Vegas to see the Blue Man Group. You want to be the one to tell her she can't go see those three fools? I sure don't. Dad, you've been teaching me since I was two. I know when it's done. Y'all better not be back here arguing. We've got the lunch rush, and I ran out of Sock It To Me cake. A baby threw up in the bathroom, and somebody's trying to pay with food stamps. - I can't take no more drama. - Elijah's not cutting the meat right. - He don't want you to go to Vegas. - That's not true. Better not be. These my ribs? Yeah, they're your ribs. How's everything tasting over here? Okay, ladies. Sorry about the wait. How are your grandmama's feet doing? They still swollen? You tell her I'm praying for her. Ooh! Girl, I know them ain't lemons on your nails. - Yep. - Let me see. - Ooh... - Going to the Beyoncé concert tonight. - Okay. - Okay... - Yeah. - Hey... Ooh, shit! Mm. Girl! Hey, Mama. Hi, my babies! Come on. Sorry I'm late to pick up lunch for the kids, but I had to take them to get shots, but I wasn't sure if I should do it 'cause of the whole autism thing. But then I decided to do it, and in the car, Kevin starts counting the McDonald's on the way here. All the McDonald's. There are 15. Look, Kevin is fine. All right? Now, his head a little big, but ain't nothing you can do about that. Come take the kids in the back. Y'all want to learn how to chop up chicken? - Mm-hmm! - Come on. Hi. How'd you grow up in a family restaurant but can't cook for shit? How you got a beard that don't connect? Huh? Stop it. This is a new blazer. - Stop! - Elijah. When you gonna man that cash register? Exactly, Elijah. Go man the cash register. - Don't you! - Elijah, pick that up. Pick it up. We ain't got to wait in line? Nah, baby, I told you. I'm family. When they die, I'm getting all this. Yo, what up, cuz? Yo, um... think you can hook me and boo up, so we ain't got to wait? J.T., I told you. Ain't no more hookups. Come on, Uncle Louis! Why are you doing me like that? You used to give me baths. Don't trip. Ah, aye, aye, aye... Kill 'em. Kill 'em. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em. Kill 'em. Kill 'em. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em. - Kill 'em... - This have an ending? Get outta here. Elijah, make a run with me. Come on. Aye, don't forget the rib tips. Hey, babe, you want some extra beans? Yeah, you do. Ah... I'm good on charcoal. - I need about two cords of hickory. - Okay. I need some more of that cherry wood I got last week. - I like the way them ribs turned out. - Very good. Now, I've got some alder wood for sale that I think... You must think I'm stupid. Can't nobody cook with that delicate shit. You still grooming junior? Hopefully one day it'll take. Tomorrow, I want you to come and meet our new meat distributor. Uh... I can't. - Well, why not? - Um... I've just, uh... got to prep some wine club shipments. How come every time I try to teach you the business, you've got an excuse why you can't do it? Last month, I needed you to go with me to see about a new smoker. You had some other wine thing. You know how hard your grandfather worked to keep this restaurant in the family. - Yes, sir. - You know what this restaurant means - to the community. - Yes. This place is historic. Frankie Beverly had a stroke there. Mm-hmm. You're gonna take over the stand one day. You need to know how to run it. That's not it. I just can't do it tomorrow. Sorry. Okay.

And then Albert Bichot was there with this new 2016 Corton Grand Cru that was like vanilla but also kind of fruity. Man, it was crazy. - How was the swag bag? - Got a neck pillow. - Swaggy. - Yeah, real swaggy. But I was thinking, they specially curated all their wines for the fair. I thought maybe we could do that for our wine club. Like what if... Just hear me out. What if we just sent out all different kinds of Barolos? Is that crazy? In Memphis? - Yeah. - Come on. We always do the same thing. We send a bunch of reds, a bunch of whites. Let's do something new. Something different, you know? Ah, come on, man. The wine fair was where you went to school, right? - Yeah, it was good. - Hmm. Classes, pretty hard or whatever? Oh, yeah. And I had a kid while I was in school. I'd go to Daddy and Me classes smelling like Merlot. Full disclosure. I wasn't the only one. So you thinking of applying or what? I don't know. Maybe. I don't think so. Why not? No wife, no kids. You've got time. Yeah, well, my Pops wants me to take over the restaurant, so... Yeah, I don't know. I just want to... find my own thing. Just make sure you're sure. I took the test three times. It was... Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Um... I'm gonna figure out this wine club stuff. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry. Y'all still open? Yeah, yeah, we're still open. I'm just Googling some wine club stuff. You know, every day I'm Googling. Okay. Yep. Uh... Um. Okay, you need help with something or something? Yeah, I just maybe wanted to learn about what I bought the other day. But, you know, this wine club stuff looks real good, though. It is. Yeah, you know, it is. Uh... Okay, so you get invited to our bi-monthly tastings and you get a free subscription to Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Oh, okay. That's what's up. Uh, let's do that. So you probably need my email, my... address, my phone number? Yes, I definitely need your number. Um... Okay, well, just in case it gets lost... Your magazine gets lost in the mail. And there's this really great article this month about corks. About corks? - Cool. - It is cool. It is cool, because you think they're just corks, but they're... not. - Wow. - Wow. Okay, okay. Um... - Before you change your mind... - Right. - Just give me that. - Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. All right, we've got chicken, ham, macaroni and cheese, and greens. Nobody's gonna eat - any of my ambrosia salad? - Huh? Maybe we just let it cool off. It's Jell-O. It's already cold. Yeah. We know. - Stop it. - Elijah, what happened to you yesterday afternoon? I thought you were supposed to pick up some more butcher paper. Oh, um... sorry, I just, uh... I had to do something. Something more important than your job? Uh... I went to a mixer about becoming a sommelier. You trying to be an African? - Is that like a pirate? - No, that's a Somalian. - What did you say? - Sommelier. Y'all know Kelly Kendrick dated a Somalian. He stole her identity. That's horrible. Is she okay? I don't know. I don't be up in people's business like that. Then why bring it up? That don't make no sense. You just told everybody that... She was supposed to redo the front of my braid. She never said anything. Hey, hey, hey. Everybody stop. Okay? Elijah was saying something. Now go on. What's... What's the thing? Uh, a sommelier is someone who's an expert in wine, like Raylan at my job. He's a sommelier, but he buys wine. At a restaurant, they help you decide which wine to drink. So they're getting paid to tell people what to drink? I could do that. Hennessy White goes with everything. Nope. Anyway, uh, Raylan says he's gonna write me a letter of recommendation. I just hope, if Raylan puts himself out there like that, you follow through. What does that mean? I mean, you get an idea about something, but when it comes time to do it... - Louis. - I'm just saying what everybody knows... Louis! But, hey, if you want to tell people what to drink with their chitlins, I'm fine with it. Wine and chitlins. Ain't that a group, Ambrosia? Baby, there's wig hair on the counter and in my sink. Can we get rid of the wigs? Uh-uh. They're too expensive. Baby, you've been in remission for two years. You don't even need 'em. I do. Louis, my hair is still too thin, and when I wear that blonde one, I look just like Beyoncé, so no. Yeah, you do look like Beyoncé. - What'd I do now? - You don't know? - I don't. - You don't know? Girl, I ain't doing this. You embarrassed Elijah at the dinner tonight. Okay? He was all excited about his little wine thing and then you went and shit all on it. Louis, you've got to support him in the stuff he wants to do. I do support him. I support him learning the business and not doing six million other things. Well, that's what kids his age do. They're trying to figure out what they're good at. At some point, he's gonna have to man up. Five years ago, he was gonna be a DJ. Then he was gonna teach English in Japan. The boy don't even eat Panda Express. That's Chinese. - Don't. - I'm just saying. We both know how this wine thing is gonna end up. Louis, you ain't even stopped to ask the boy why he wants to do the sommely thing. I mean, you've got to give him a chance to figure it out. What am I gonna do in the meantime? Just wait? I'm not getting any younger. If he don't take over the stand, who's gonna carry it on when I'm gone? My father started the thing... he gave it to me, and I'm supposed to... Give it to Elijah. I know. That's right. I know you ain't trying to get nothing started after you talked about my wigs. - Baby... - Back up. Uh-uh! You ain't getting that either!

Uh-huh. - Guess what? - What? I bought a bottle of Chardonnay yesterday. - Uh-huh. - A French one. Oh, hold up. Hold up, hold up. Wait, so you went to another wine store already? You cheating on me already? I mean... So wine's, like, your thing? Yeah, kind of. Since when? Mm... Like four or five years ago. I was, uh... I was at this restaurant with my ex... Oh, hold up. No, no, no. There was somebody before me? Ooh. Was she ugly? Why has she got to be ugly? I don't know. You picked her. You're clearly upgrading. Okay, anyway... Um. Yeah, I was about to buy this cheap bottle of wine and the waiter was like, "Nah, try this." And so he goes on and on about this wine, he's talking about stuff I never thought about before, like, you know, how it's grown, where the grapes are from, all this stuff. And so when I get home, I start researching everything I can about this wine I like. Then it led to the next wine, and the next wine, and the next wine. Yeah, I don't know. Like, growing up... we didn't have money to go nowhere, so... when I get a wine from some place like France, some place like Spain, I just feel like I'm kinda there. You know what? You ain't right. What? To tell me a great story like that on the first date? Now I got to go on another one. And another one. Yeah, that's okay. - You sprung. It's alright. Could be worse. - Whatever. So since you're so into wine, you ever want to do more than just work in the store? Um... Yeah, yeah, I'm, um... thinking about... think about becoming a sommelier. But, um... I don't know. The Master exam is pretty hard, so... So? You're smart. And the fact that I'm still here means you can keep up. Okay. Yeah. But in the whole, entire world, there's only, like, 230 Master Somms. So why can't you be 231? Uh... I don't know. It's just, between work and then studying for an exam, I just think it'll be a lot. If you work on passing the test as much as you do coming up with excuses, it won't be hard. I'm sorry. That's not my place to say. - I don't know you like that. - It's alright. It's all good. It's all good. I mean... there's always gonna be a reason we shouldn't do something, but... if you want it... This is the entrance exam to the Master Sommelier program. There's theory and tasting and you'll need to score an 80% to pass. Good luck. Begin. So, how'd you do? I'm still just waiting for the results. But you think you passed though? I don't know. I hope so. Well, I'm claiming we're gonna pass, and if we don't, then we'll just do it again next year. We? You trying to be a "we"? If you act right. My boss just got back. - Call me when you know. - Yeah. 'Kay. That was just my granny. She fell out the bed. It's fucking ridiculous, right? What? I've taken the exam twice. It's never taken this long to get the results. How many times did you take it? Oh, this is my first time. Yeah, you'll probably fail. Don't feel bad. You a somm? No, I work at Joe's Wines. You? Waiter at Oak and Forage. Pay's good. I used to date the hostess. She was pretty hot... ish. Not that I'm hot or anything. What do you think? On a scale of one to ten, what would you say I am? Like a five or something? Like, I feel like I have, like, a good neck or something. - Mm-hmm. - Oh. Hey. Gonna see if your name's here?

It's the same day, every April 15th. But I'm thinking a lot of things that Papa did... were kind of... old. But I thought that... That this place can be... how we do it. The neighborhood is gentrifying. You know, the white folks. And, uh, I was thinking I'd do a bar where you can do your... your wine thing, you know. Uh... You know more about that than I do. Mm. Yeah. Huh. Um... Wow. Yeah, this is real nice of you, Daddy, but, um... Uh, I don't know. This is a lot. Well, uh... Yeah. Well, run the other place. It pretty much runs itself, you know. What? Okay, I don't, um... I don't want to take over the... I don't want to take over the restaurant. Uh, I've been meaning to tell you, but, um... I'm going back to school. You remember when I said I was interested in becoming a sommelier? The African wine thing? Again, it has nothing to do with Africa. Um... But, yeah, no, I took the entrance exam. I got in and... well, uh, I start in a few days. I mean, tuition's gonna wipe out all my savings, but I'm excited, you know? So... So what do you think? I think you're a grown man. You don't want to run a restaurant, don't run the restaurant. I won't let school get in the way of work. Okay. I'm gonna close up. The Master exam is the hardest exam you will ever take in your life. You will be tested on your theory. You will be tested on your service. And you will also be tested on your blind tasting. The blind tasting is the most important part of anything you will do. And this is the grid. This is what you will need to know to identify each and every single wine properly. You will be tested on the sight and the clarity of the wine. You will be tested on the fruit and the non-fruit components. Acid, structure, balance. I need to know whether or not this wine is an Old World wine or a New World wine. I need to know the grape variety, and most importantly, the region. Of the five sub-regions, there's Chablis, Côte de Nuits, Côte de Beaune, Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais. And within these sub-regions, there are 500 premier cru vineyards. Make sure about wines. About wine serving. Um... All right. You studying? Yep. What are you doing? You almost done? No. - No? - No. Are you sure? No. What's your size? Come here. This one might work. What do you think? Like it? Then cut the foil at the bottom of the lip, then repeat the same on the back side. Then one last cut up. Now you can remove the foil. - All right, here it is. - Good looking on this. Of course. Okay, if you're cooking red meat, I'd go with the Pinot Noir. You cooking white, I say the Albert Bichot La Moutonne. Moutonne. Oh, that sounds bold as hell. - Yeah, I'm about to be Moutonne. - You know this nigga down. They don't even know. And you know it's fancy, - because it's in cursive. - Yep. - I appreciate you. - Sure. Oh, Chablis. Yeah, that's cool. How are you at the German varietals? I'm okay. These names are insane. Müller-Thurgau, Spätburgunder, Weissburgunder? Hold up. Y'all using my favorite mug as a spit cup? Oh, uh, I told him this was your favorite mug and Elijah was like, "Use this, Richie." And I was like, "Are you sure? This looks like Tanya's special mug." I mean, look at it. - I just had a feeling about it. - Have a good time in there. I'm sorry, that usually works for me. Throwing my friends under the bus. Acidity, medium. Actually, medium minus. Tasting some new oak, spice notes, toasted vanilla. Medium tannin. This wine is dry. This wine is from a warm climate. New World. Possibly... Argentina. Malbec. This is from the Uco Valley. It's a 2006 Alta Vista Single Vineyard Temis. It is. Is that five in a row? I think that's five in a row. I hate this guy. Who gives a shit? He's just showing off. You guys want in? - No, man, you got it. - Yeah. I do got it. All right. One wine, one guess. - Begin. - Color, the wine is yellow. This wine is yellow-gold. A very pale concentration. Some floral notes. - Lemon. - Hints of new oak. This wine is dry. Medium minus acidity. - Acidity, medium plus. - Alcohol, medium. Complexity is medium. This wine is from a cool climate. - This is Old World, from France. - This is a Chardonnay from Burgundy. - From Burgundy. - From Chablis. - From Côte de Beaune. - It's a Simmonet-Febvre Chablis. This wine is Olivier Leflaive Les Sétilles Chardonnay. Final answers? It's Simmonet-Febvre. - Fuck him. - I don't care about beating him. I'm pissed I didn't know the wine. We've been studying every night, right? - It's only been a month. - No, that's not the point. I mean, those wines weren't that hard. It's not gonna get any easier. Yeah, that's true. - Hey, you want a coffee? - Let me get you a coffee. Cool. Thanks. I need money. For what? You just said you were gonna get me a coffee. Yeah, "get." I'll get it for you when you give me the money. Hey, I'm doing you a favor, okay? I don't need the sighs. It's rude. I'm just saying it's rude. A ten? How am I supposed to get myself a croissant with this? I'll make it work. Olivier Leflaive. Are you still upset? I'm Eric, but they call me Harvard. I went to Harvard. Uh... Look, a friend and I are starting a study group. Thought we could team up. Uh... Yeah, I don't have time to fuck around. You... You think I'm fucking around? I don't know what you're doing, but if it's like that bullshit you... It pushed you though, right? Look, it's impossible to pass the Master exam without a study group, so... might as well push each other. You got that barbecue spaghetti ready? Cheryl been sent that out. Damn, it's hot. Is this what menopause feels like? I don't know. I'm 40. - What? - What? It's just you're all up on me. Breathing. Yeah, no, I was just gonna... I was gonna ask if I could swap shifts. Yeah, so, um, I joined a study group with some of the guys from class and... Wednesday is the only time they have off, so... Why I gotta move my whole life around to accommodate you? Whole life? I'm just asking to swap shifts. Well, Wednesday is our busiest day. We gotta start the wood, Brine the chicken, start prepping the big orders. Hey, look, I'll swap with Elijah. No, you can't. We're going to CC's. It's all-you-can-eat crab. That's Dungeness and soft shell. I thought you said you weren't gonna let this wine thing mess with your work. - That's what you said, right? - Yeah.

Leeuwin Estate Art Series Cab. - What year? - Ticktock, ticktock. 2007? Fucking fuck! It was a Cab, but it's a three from Napa. You need a towel. Your whole face is sweaty. You guys switched the wines? Why would we switch the wines? - 'Cause you're dicks. - That's fair. Oh, shit. What? Our class is doing an exchange program - with our sister school in Paris. - What? We've got to pay for it though. That's bad for me. That's bad for me. Dude, who gives a shit? It's Paris. What? Um... No, I just... I probably can't go. What? You have to go. It'll be like The Three Amigos only having two amigos. Although three of us will be going, so we will actually be The Three Amigos. Yeah. Let's get some fresh air. We did switch the wines. Fuck... you. So... you really can't go? I mean, I emptied out my savings for the tuition, and... what, this trip's, like, an extra ten grand? I mean, can't you ask your parents or...? No, they ain't got money like that, man. I mean... Me even being in school right now is a whole thing for my pop, so... Yeah, man, I get that. My dad is... He's not cool I'm in school either. But at the end of the day... I gotta do what I got to do. Hey, I hear you, but... you know... What if, uh... What if you and I went half on everything? Could you do it then? So everybody in your class is going? Yep. - Harvard said he would split it with you? - Yeah. - And Raylan said he's fine with it? - Yes. - So why can't you go? - 'Cause I don't have the money. - But Paris is, like, it for wine, right? - Yeah. Then, baby, you gotta go. This is a real step towards what you... I know it's a real step. You don't think I know it's a real step? - I do. - Then why are you acting like I don't? - I'm not trying to fight with you. - Are you sure? Yeah. I just, I don't get why you're not doing everything you can to go. It's not like you're doing everything you need to be doing, so. - What? - You're telling me what I need to do, but you aren't a nurse. Why don't you go back to school - instead of just being a receptionist? - Fuck you. - When it's all so easy... - Fuck you. Okay. Want me to set the alarm? Okay. So you're not gonna talk to me now? I mean, it's whatever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just don't wanna fuck it all up. Why would you fuck it up? I'm just so close. What if I get there and I'm no good? Then what? It's not like I've got the money anyway, so, whatever. Your family can't help you? No. They ain't got the money either. I know. Maybe they can help you get it. Anyone else? Give me some of that. It's a good bottle, E. Mm. What's it mean, "Grand Cru"? Yeah, that pretty much means it's the best. Yeah. It's actually not that hard to read a label. It's divided into five parts. The producer's name. The region it's from. The varietal. Like whether it's a Cab or Merlot. - Hmm! - The vintage, or the year the grapes are pulled. And then you got the alcohol level, which... Can I have more green beans? Why? Um... Let me see that. See, I didn't know that, you know, every little thing on here had its own meaning. - That's something. - You know, I don't know how Elijah memorizes all this stuff. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, he's still studying. So you be spending the night over there? Oh, no, no, just... Ooh... Y'all just over there sinning. Yeah, um... You know what? It actually kind of helps when I think of wine like barbecue. You know, uh, certain places just do certain things good. Like Memphis and ribs or, uh, Texas and brisket. It's kind of like Argentina and Malbec or Provence and rosé. What region would Dad's barbecue be from? Courvoisier. - You are so stupid. - My bad. I'm just glad you've found something you like. Oh, I'm just trying to stay focused. It's harder than you thought, huh? You know... You know what? At times, yeah. It always is. Hmm. I guess I'll get better at it once I go to Paris. What? Yeah, no, um... That's amazing, man. Uh, yeah, uh, my class got asked to go to Paris and study wine. When do you leave? Well, I don't... I don't actually have the money. Not yet. But I'm gonna have at least half when I sell my car. Wait, wait, wait. - You gotta sell your car? - Come on, man, you can't sell the Nissan. We got so many blow... Tires. Just flat... - tires is all. All over the place. - Hush. Listen. Money, ain't never been the reason nobody in this family did nothing. Okay? So if you're gonna sell your car to come up with half, then we're gonna get together and come up with the other half. To my baby going to Paris! I'm gonna need you to trim these a little more. The last few ribs had too much fat. - How much do you want me to cut? - Eh, just... Uh... At least a... a quarter of an inch. - That's fine. - Okay. Okay, can I have everybody's attention, please? Okay, shoo, shoo, shoo. Okay, come on, everybody be quiet, alright? Hush it up. Don't mess up my moment. Uh, Elijah, come on up here. Okay, look at my baby. - Don't he look good? - Yeah! Do you know how much your family loves you, boy? Do you? - I do. - Do you? - Mm-hmm. I do. - Mm? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, well, they love you so much that... they raised $3,820,45. Really, J.T? What? Why everybody looking at me? Forty-five cents? When's my party? All a parent wants... is for their child to be happy. And when I had cancer, I didn't... Take your time. To sit here today in front of all y'all... and watch my baby go to Paris... You're going to Paris. To be a sommelier! Ooh! God is good, 'cause that's the first time I got that word right! Huh? Won't he do it? I'm not gonna take up all the time, because I know Elijah's daddy wants to say something. Baby? I think you said it all, baby. Okay, well, um... the food is ready, and we've got some fancy French desserts, too. ♪ As late as the hour may be ♪ Hey. - Hey. - Uh... Are you working?

I'm sure your Mom'll drink it. Damn. That's what our last words are gonna be before I leave? Last words? - Last words. - See, why you got to do that? You're the one that said, "Last words," like you were going off to war. You're gonna be in Paris drinking wine and eating croissants and shit. Yeah, you know, ever since I started school, you've been giving me a hard time. 'Cause you think you're better than us. That ain't true? Every time I try to teach you the business, you'd rather waste time doing five million other things. None of which led to a damn thing. Yeah, 'cause I didn't wanna get stuck in the barbecue... Stuck?

Mm... Want a blanket or some... some water? Could we have some water and some of them cookies y'all make? Louis, I don't want no cookies. I know. They're for me. The doctor says he's coming by with the test results today, right? - Yes, baby. - Okay. Ooh, look, wait. Elijah sent some pictures. Oh, this is him standing next to some French building. Him next to another... building, yeah. Okay, well, basically it's him standing next to a whole bunch of buildings, but they're French buildings. He looks so happy. You see that shit? They got the white people their cookies first. What's the point of having a PPO if you can't get free cookies? So... every time I bring up Elijah, you're just not gonna talk about it? Okay. Talk about it all you want. Uh-huh. I don't want him to know about none of this right now. There ain't nothing he can do for me from over there. Okay. Ooh, he got that little French hat. I wanted that! It would look so cute on me. Et voilà. Here we are. We've arrived at the home of... Albert Bichot. - Are you sure it's not? - Yep. You for real thought this was a Domaine de Bonserine Côte-Rôtie? Yeah, it tasted like one. - No, it didn't. - Shut up. Côte-Rôtie wines are from the Rhone Valley. They have crazy tannic undertones. This has almost no tannin. Okay, so you're the master of tannin now? Huh? Does this have tannin? Tell him this has tannin. - There's no tannin. - Show me on the map. - All right. - Thank you, genius. - Yes. - Hey. Can we talk real quick? All right. We're gonna take a little boat ride.

It's our anniversary. Congratulations. - Thank you. - In that case, may I recommend the 2010 Estate Chardonnay from Staglin Vineyards in Napa. Napa wine? But we are in France. Right. You are right. I'm so sorry. Uh, in that case, may I recommend a very good French Chardonnay, the, uh, 2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru? First, you suggest a Californian Chardonnay. Now it's a French one. You can't make up your mind? - No, I absolutely can. I... - In a minute, he's going to suggest one from Spain and they don't even make Chardonnay. Uh... Uh, I'm so sorry. You know what, as a matter of fact, I'll just remove your red wine glasses and I'll... I'm so sorry. Um... I'm so... Uh... Let me just clear that up. Excuse me. Sorry about that. Cut. I'm glad everyone saw this. When you're a sommelier and you're working, something like this will happen. Unhappy customers, getting flustered. That's why we practice it. Now, what could Elijah have done differently? Yes? Hey. Hey, baby. How are you doing? I'm out pre-gaming with my girls. This bitch, Ava, got engaged! Wait, sorry, who? Who got engaged? I know, right? It's in the bag. Why are you up? It's the middle of the night there. - I don't know. I'm just feeling kind of... - I'm getting married! I'm sorry, baby. What's going on? No, hey, you... you... you're having fun with your girls. You go have fun. - It's all good. - No! No, no. Call me back tomorrow. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey, um... do you mind spotting me?

How's your day? It's fine, thank you. Great. I'm happy to hear that. And the weather in Memphis? It's good? It's okay, it's all right. Great. Great. At Wells Fargo, we always want to make sure our customers are... Jimmy, I got shit to do. Can we speed this up? Copy that. I'm... I'm calling because I wanted to verify that you authorized a transfer of $1,500. - Fifteen hundred dollars? - I didn't do that. Where is it... Where is it transferred to? Give me one second to pull that up. It was a bank account in Paris. You gave Elijah $1,500? He needed it. He asked for it. Actually, he told me not to send it. And I sent it anyway. I'm just... I'm tired of you two fussing and fighting back and forth. What y'all gonna do if I'm not here? You can't do that. You can't use cancer to win a fight. Yeah, I can. Me and my father ain't done all this work for Elijah to... - You and Elijah ain't you and your daddy. - I know. When my daddy had that stroke, I did all I could to keep - that restaurant going. I didn't leave. - I know. There's value in that. There is. Everything I learned from my father happened there. Everything I taught Elijah happened there. And then that boy - wanna come and throw everything away... - He ain't throwing you away, Louis. He just wants something different, and you've gotta make peace with that. Mrs. Bruener, you want to try and eat something? Mm-mm. Come sit by me. You eat today? Yeah, I had a little bit of this, a little bit of that. - Yeah? - Yeah. You want what's on my tray? I wouldn't touch that if you made me. Want me to cook for you? Want me to get you some ribs? I wish I could. You can't handle ribs now. Yeah, ribs. I'm gonna make me some ribs. Okay...

I don't see how he kept one going. Well, you kept it going, too. I did what I had to do. Um... You ever regret it? Regret what? You know, leaving... leaving college, taking over the stand. Not really. I mean... Sometimes I wonder what it would've been like to have been a teacher. Uh... I'm sorry. That's what you went to college for? You were studying to be a teacher? Yes. And? I just didn't know that's why you were going to school, that's all. I don't see what's so damn funny. I wanted to help little black kids read. It's beautiful. Yes. Black kids should read. Of course.

Forget the fact that I even had to hear about it from Richie, instead of my man. But like for real? Well, it's not really a good time right now. So what about the Master test? You can't just cram for it. I'll take it next year. Next year? After all the work and money you put in? No, that's a waste. I don't think helping my dad right now is a waste.

And if you give me a little extra, I won't be mad at you. You know, 'cause of slavery. Yeah, um, do you have a Shiraz from Barossa, Bin 28? No, but we have a really great French Shiraz and our house Cab is amazing. Okay, what year's the Cab? Thirteen. Fantesca from the Spring Mountain. Okay. Yeah, no, I heard a lot of hype about the thirteen, but I'm thinking about getting a rib eye, so I wanted something more peppery, smoky. Well, we do have a Cab-Shiraz blend. Bin 389, 2010. Oh, yeah. Let me get that. Man was just sitting on that Baby Grange. What's that? Oh, it's out of Australia, from the Penfolds. It's, uh... It's this wine. Deep purple. Ginger, blackberry notes. Super chocolaty finish. It's just good. Grizzlies gotta start playing more D though. We should've picked up some more charcoal when we were out there. How much more have we got left? Like three. All right. I could set up the cash register, so it could print receipts or email. Uh-huh. I have a new idea for the restaurant. You know, we could set up some... outdoor seating. Double our dining space. That way, you know, people get to see how the sausage gets made, while the sausage is getting made. So what do you think? I could help set it up. You want to set this up and study for the wine test? I mean, I was just trying to help you out, so you don't have to do it by yourself. Don't use me and your mom not here as an excuse. Excuse for what? You remember how you said I got stuck working at the barbecue stand? Yeah. I shouldn't have said that. I'm... No, it's all right. I mean, I wanted to knock you out, but... I didn't know what I wanted to do when Papa asked me to take over the restaurant. But I knew I had to go all in to find out. You love this wine thing? Yeah. Describe the style of wines most associated with Sauvignon AOP. Dry, high in extract, middle-driven... long-living... austere notes. Put those dishes right there. What are the wine regions of the Rhone Valley? Côte-Rôtie, Saint-Joseph... Hermitage... This wine is dry. Bone dry. Um, acidity... medium. Medium plus. Uh...? Yeah, medium plus. Let me come back to this one. This wine... Let's see. This wine... This wine is light red. Like unripe strawberry. Fuck. Hey, this'll happen. Just fall back on the grid, and tune everything else out. I'm gonna go get some more wine. With the smokiness of the brisket... pair it with a Barolo, a Syrah, an Australian Shiraz. The chicken, I'd pair it with... a Zinfandel. Maybe... Maybe a Côtes du Rhône. Name for a red and white wine that's made in America with a blend of classic Bordeaux grape varieties... Uh... Saint Meritage. Wait. Yeah. Okay, what does "Sori" mean? Sori, um... Medium minus acidity. This wine is New World. 2005? This is from Argentina. This wine is a blend. Bodega Catena Zapata. Is this Boone's Farm? You got something against Strawberry Hill? Yeah, I'm hoping the drive will clear my head. I keep getting the, uh... a little shaky on the Californian wines. Kept on mixing up the Sonoma ones with the Russian River Valley, so... I don't know. We'll see. I know you got your own style and whatnot, but I was... thinking you might... thought you might wanna wear your grandfather's suit to the... to the test. Hey. I remember this suit. He bought it when he was going to get a loan to open up the restaurant. Oh, yeah? It brought him good luck? Hell, no. He was a black man getting a loan in the 1960s. He was denied by every bank in town. But he eventually won it in a dice game. This is so cool. - It still smells like him. - I know. Oh, yeah... Get you out of here. - There you go. - All right.

The first part of the Master exam is blind tasting. You'll have a total of 25 minutes to correctly identify your six wines. The clock will start as soon as you touch your first glass. Wine one was clearly a 2012 Maison Verget Meursault Les Clous. I called wine one 2013 Aubert CIX Sonoma Coast Chardonnay. 2008 Vie di Romans Pinot Grigio? No, it definitely wasn't that.
