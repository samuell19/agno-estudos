Subtitles by explosiveskull This is a robbery! This is BY3462 reporting above New York, is there anyone in the vicinity? I repeat, anyone in the vicinity? Detective Frank McMillian here, what is it? Where are you? We're on the upper east side near 82nd Street, how can we assist? There's two suspects that have reportedly robbed Jenkin's Jewelry Store, heading into Jamaica Boat Yard, can you deal with it? Yeah. Okay, there they go. Hell are those fuckers going? Shit, where the fuck are they now? Fuckers are on the roof. Shit, they're on the fucking roof again. That's it, we got 'em. You're not gonna get away that easy. My name is Frank McMillian. I'm 55 years old, and a detective in the New York Police Department. I've been serving for over 30 years and the job is getting harder. Criminals seem to be getting younger, and the crimes, well, they seem to be getting tougher the older I get. I'm used to dealing with murderers, rapists, gun shootings, robberies, whatever shit comes along. Whenever there's a dirty case, they just seem to call on me. I'm like a New York Dirty Harry. But in the past we could do something about it, kick a few asses without the law or the do-gooders kicking ours. The law would turn a blind eye. Now if you step on a criminal's toes, he screams to the Justice Department about unfair treatment. But what about the victim? Who speaks for them? Until recently, I thought I did. Then one day as we were on our usual surveillance, call came in from the whirly bird. We were only a couple of blocks away so we took the call. That's when we saw it, the two motherfuckers running through Atkin's Boat Yard. It was supposed to be an easy arrest. The bird in the sky had told us that these two guys had stolen a bunch of jewels from the local mall, and that they were on foot. So, they should be easy to catch. But then nothing is that easy. Joel Wiseman wasn't really a friend, or a drinking buddy, but he was a good man. He had two kids, and a sex-crazed wife that would poke anyone after a couple of vodkas. I should know, I wrestled with the woman once or twice when my cock spoke louder than my head. But what the hell, these things happen. Hmm, who gives a shit now, he's dead. So he was a nice guy. But most important, he was my partner. Now, the whole process starts again. Finding someone I can trust, and will protect your back when you go up against the bad guys. Joel did that for me, more than once. Always wanted to be a policeman, protect and serve. But it all changed that day. Joel did that for me, more than once. Maybe I'm getting tired, maybe I'm getting too old for this job. You can only do it for so long, especially when your hands are tied. If they'd only let me do what I'm best at doing, banging heads. Maybe it's time to retire. But who then is gonna kick the shit out of these assholes? Heh, maybe I should go do it alone, become a vigilante. It's more my style, a Shogun assassin like they had in Japan, oh yeah, who needs the police department anyway. New York City. Home to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Statue of Liberty. 10 million people make their way through New York like rats. Work themselves worthless. It's a fast-paced, globally influential center of art, culture, fashion, finance... and crime. The city's five boroughs sit between the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean, with Manhattan at its core. New York is the largest city in the United States. Known as the Big Apple to some, Gotham to others, but to its occupants, it is the city that never sleeps. Don't you ever laugh at me again, you low-life fucking whore! You won't be slapping any more girls around with your little cock, will you, tough guy? Mummy, mummy! Mummy's gonna have a big lunch now little girl, - just wait and see! - No! I hope your momma's gonna have a deep throat. Please no! It's bad luck to kill a raven. It is for the bird. Count me out. Too rich for you, Shylock? Or you lost face? Or maybe the raven's put the scares on you, eh? You Jews are all the same, you want the money, bloodsucker, but you don't want to take the risks. Leave it to us good Catholic boys, eh, McMillian? Boo! It's like I said, no show, no go, Shylock. Ah, now where were we? Oh yeah, , just you and me, McMillian. Uhhmm. Ah,. It's time to win my money back and a little more! And if you are a good boy, maybe, and I do mean maybe, I'll take a marker against that badge you wear so precariously. What do you say McMillian, you want to be on my payroll? Earn some decent money for a change? You came here to gamble slime ball, or romance me with that tongue of yours? Tell your Rottweiler to sit down before he gets hurt. I'm not so easy to throw out of a window. Ha, an uncorruptible policeman, eh boss? Now that's not something you see every day, especially not in this city. You think he's funny, Cyclops? I'll show you who's funny when I win this hand. Then we'll see you laugh on the other side of your face! You're hoping I'll get my boy here, to teach you some flying lessons like he did with Dragman. We're here to play cards, Wynchapel. So play. Oh. Now that's a tough guy. Ain't you, McMillian, a real tough guy. Well, don't blame me, tough guy, when you have to take the bus home. Do you want to bet on that? - What? - Are you deaf? You're challenging me, Detective, with that hard-earned pension fund, or is it mob money you scabbed from my fellow business associates? No show, no go. That's what you said, remember? You'll take a marker? Do I look like a loan shark to you? Why don't you ask your accountant? Looks like you're the one taking that bus home, Boss! I don't lose face to no one! Especially from a fucking accountant. You got a problem with this? He's your accountant, Wynchapel. Well I'll have to get another bean counter to cook the books then, won't I? You got him good, Boss, real good. That fucker won't be mouthing off to you again. You bet he won't. All new situation, eh, Boss? A dead kike, and his money. So, can we proceed? You want me to teach this joker a lesson? Teach him some manners, Mr. Wynchapel? Later. Later? Right. A full house. Unbeatable even for you! Not with that it ain't. Oh, ah! McMillian, no, please, I, I wouldn't have hurt you, I swear as God as my witness, I-I-I wouldn't touch a single hair on your head! The date was April, the 26th, almost 10 years ago. It was the first time that I encountered Mr. William Bard. Heir to the Bard billions. And known sociopath. He'd just robbed this old family Beck. Wasn't going to be the last time our paths would cross. You know we got him in our sights, they'll be down 57th Street! Shoot those fuckers Gilly, shoot them! Okay Gilly, shoot those motherfuckers! Go on Gilly, shoot 'em! Time to shoot us a pig or two, Gilly! Yeah... We're gonna need more men! In fact we're gonna need an army to stop this madman! Ram the bastard off the road before he kills someone! Damn, push this fucker off the road! Take the next turnoff and go down 58th, and cut him off down Second Avenue. That'll surprise him, mad bastard! I love this city! Yay, there he is, head him off! Oh my god! Shit! New York, New York, so good they named it twice! This is Tim Vine from CNB news reporting to you today, the incredible breaking story that William Bard, the heir of the Bard Corporation, has been jailed for 11 years at the New York Supreme Court. There's not a prison that can hold me, for I, I'm William Bard! Good of you to come Miss Fawkes. Did you manage to bring that, book we spoke about? Well thank you, Miss Fawkes. It's so much nicer having a black sheep in the family. Makes life so more comfortable, don't you think? Light's out Bard, time to go to bed. You've got two minutes, and then everything goes dark! What did I tell you? Lights out! A shame, I really liked him. Showtime, folks! So what you're telling me, is that no one knows what's going on, and not one of you knew that Dr. Fawkes was possibly having an affair with a prisoner, is that correct? Hello sir, Tenison here! It seems that the CCTV footage you requested on William Bard, has been erased! But after some time I have been able to rebuild the data for you, but there is some digital drop outs within the timeline. Transfer image to the main video monitor. The images you now are watching was taken from CCTV cameras that were hidden in the lane, the day that William Bard got facially injured. This is the Lombard family coming home from a night at the theater. Sir, as you can see, they never expected what was going to happen to them next. Unfortunately for them, a shortcut ended up being a quick way to the morgue. William is going to love you. But, we haven't got any money. I didn't ask for any! I, I only have a couple of bucks on me but I, I've got plenty of credit cards, you're more than welcome to them. By the way, just take my wallet. Yeah, I know you, you're William Bard, right I... I, I-I'm Micheal Lombard, I used to work with your father, in, in the Accounting Department back in Queens. I, I-I suppose I work for you now. Did you like my father? You can be honest, Mr. Accountant. No I, I don't suppose I did. Me neither. An honest man is so hard to come by these days. You bastard! You asked him to tell you! Yes I did, didn't I? Why did you shoot him? I like to kill things, it makes me relax. You're nothing but a murderer, he did nothing to you! Shut the bitch up! I'm trying to think! Look, Lombard! You take the lom out of the Lombard, and what have you got, the Bard! Now that's funny! We could be cousins! How about a fuck, cuz? That's funny. What's funny? It was! You shot your accountant, now you'll never know how much money you have. - 'Cause you're stupid. - Stupid, you think I'm stupid? No, I was just saying. - Saying what? - Nothing Boss, nothing. Nothing, saying nothing? What do you mean nothing? I don't need a nothing! That's right, now you're really seeing right. Some people like to paint, some people like to sing, others like to fuck! I like to kill people! It relaxes me! When you have money you can do anything. You're mad! Mad? I'll be known as the mad, bad Bard! Okay honey bun, watch it. Please, help us! Take it easy, have you gotten where I slip my cock into that pink fold, between those legs of yours! No! What does it look like? I've seen worse. Worse, worse, where? In the fucking abattoir? - No! - I'm a billionaire! Not a fucking! Oh my god no, ah... I want you to scan the city for a Dr. Zilia Fawkes. Dating again, sir? She was and employee at the Bedlam Asylum before she became an assassin for William Bard. I get your point sir, but it has been quite a while since you even went out to dinner with a young lady, or Commissioner Rosen, come to that. Tenison you might be right, but at the moment I need to know, how can someone like William Bard corrupt the mind of a woman like Dr. Zilia Fawkes. She was rich, intelligent, but the fiend still made her his own. Maybe this club, the Vertical Smile will hold the answers. Ladies and gentlemen, dames and monsieur! Let me welcome you to the home of the exotic, the pleasure dome of the perverse, the Sin City of America, the Vertical Smile. - Money! - Money! ♪ Money makes the ♪ ♪ World go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Yeah money make the world go around ♪ ♪ World go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It's money make the world go around, yeah ♪ - ♪ Yo ♪ - ♪ Break out the money ♪ ♪ The money means cash ♪ ♪ Bring out the bill, bringing out the stash ♪ ♪ Slinging my thing all over the club ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Look at that bush ♪ ♪ Still smoking that shrub ♪ - ♪ Yo ♪ - ♪ Money makes the world ♪ ♪ Go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the ♪ ♪ Money makes the ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Yeah money make the world go around ♪ ♪ World go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It's money make the world go around ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Yo ♪ ♪ Break out the money, the money means cash ♪ ♪ Bring out the bill, bringing out the stash ♪ ♪ Slinging my thing all over the club ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Look at that bush ♪ - ♪ Still smoking that shrub ♪ - ♪ Yo ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ It makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Yeah money make the world go around ♪ ♪ World go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Yeah money make the world go around ♪ ♪ Makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Money makes the world go around ♪ ♪ Yeah money make the world go around ♪ ♪ Makes the world go around ♪ You want something, Detective? Light me. So tough guy, why the visit? Why did you break William Bard out of prison? Now why, Detective? I'll ask one more time. Why did your break William Bard out of prison? Are you in love with him? You could say. Why? Would that stop you wanting to fuck me? Just answer my questions. Or do you want me to arrest you? Didn't think it would. As William Bard wandered the night clubs of New York, looking for that ultimate fix, his answer suddenly came. William Bard didn't start out depraved. He just became evil, and the catalyst event of depravity took him down that road to Hell. Her name was Elizabeth Bathory, Hungarian noblewoman and alleged serial killer who had signed a pact with the devil, along with her collaborators, tortured and killed over 650 young women, so she could stay young, by bathing in their blood. Now in New York, she lies in waiting for like-minded individuals to turn into followers, as they are embraced by the Dark Lord Satan. Whatever you're selling sweetheart, I'm not buying, I'm just here for the show. Are you sure Mr. Bard, because you really look like you need something. No thanks. What about something a little different? I've just been fucked tonight, and I'm really not interested in drugs. What about an experience Mr. Bard, something you haven't tried or will try again? You won't regret it. I doubt that. Okay you got my attention. How much? Nothing! Okay Miss Bathory, why am I here? Be quiet William, and listen. Do you believe in the cards, William? No, I don't. A shame. You should. Take one. Ah, the Hanged Man. That indicates that you are at a crossroads in your life. You want more, but you don't know how to get it. Your family are worth billions, but that doesn't give you what you want. Again. Ah, the Magician indicates that you are a person without purpose. But, you have the ability to be very powerful. If, you desire. Continue. This is the Fool, which you will become, without guidance. This will unleash the demon inside you, to its full potential. Fulfill your destiny and become one with the dark side, Mr. Bard! Breathe it in, William. And tell me what you see! Within days, the drug that Elizabeth Bathory had given William Bard had taken hold. Now he was on a mission to fulfill that dream, whatever the cost. Oh, please don't hurt us, please! We won't say a thing! You can leave and we won't even mention that you were here! You've still got time to go without anybody else knowing what you've done! Just please don't hurt the children! Hurt you, whatever gave you that idea? I like children, especially the quiet ones! Boo! So tell me teacher, what do you like to teach? English. Yeah but what? Drama. Drama? - Who? - Shakespeare. Shakespeare! I love Shakespeare! Is this a dagger that I see before me? The handle before my hand? Come! Let me clench thee. Had me not, though I had me still. Children, never forget Shakespeare, he is real! Ah... Oh leave them alone please! I beseech you! They're so young, and innocent! Just how I like them! No, they're too young! Impressionable! You mustn't! Mustn't I? They've done nothing to you, or your men! For god's sake! They're just children! Take me if you want. Do what you need to do. But please, don't hurt the children. Now would I? No, no, stop it! They're just children! Why should I? They're children. If you want to take it out on anybody, do it to me, but not here. Where? Anywhere, away from here. The other room maybe. Thanks for the offer, Teach, but you're a little old for my taste, you know what I mean? I like my fruit a little... fresher. Now, Teacher has the right idea. This is to all you in the City of Los Angeles. If you don't bring me $10 million by 6:00 PM tonight, her little friends here are gonna be as dead as the bard, and their teacher! Ah, I'll be waiting! I'm standing here outside Delmont High School in central Los Angeles. It's 6:30 PM on a sunny evening, in a mild mannered suburb of southern California. It was here, at 10:00 AM this morning, that a man only known to us as the Comedian with three of his henchmen, walked into the school and took schoolteacher Mary Shelley, and 12 of her students hostage, demanding $10 million in return for their safety. This is what happened at 5:00 PM today. Some of you may find this disturbing. We have your money! Now let the children go as agreed! Back off G-man, or I'm gonna kill her here right now! Well here's your money! Let her go. Let her go, is that what you want me to do, let her go! Get down! Okay! Don't tell me what to do again, do you understand? I said, "Do you understand?" Yes. Now back off! Or the next time, the kids in there are gonna get it too! But you got your money! There's no need for anybody else to be hurt! Do you think I care about the money, Mr. Policeman? Not really. Burn! That was a replay of what happened here today at 5:00 PM. Since then the building has been under siege. Maybe we can ask the arresting officer for some more information. Detective Stinwinksi, can you tell us what happened here today? Uh, I've never seen anything like this in my 20 years in the service. I mean, this bastard and his men, they... they didn't care about the money. They came here to kill, that's all. Kill. My god they did. In the footage, we saw Schoolteacher Mary Shelley get gunned down, why? God knows, I couldn't say. I mean, this Comedian, he's a madman. But you gave this man his money, what was his reason? I don't know. Detective, the money was in the bag, wasn't it? Yeah, of course it was. Detective, was the money in the bag or not? No, it wasn't. Look this state's broke. We asked the mayor and he said he couldn't afford to pay any ransom! I just do what I'm told, okay? No questions asked! It's not my fault, okay? It's not my fault! Why did you do it? Let me loose here man, , love 'em , love 'em! My fellow Americans, today is a sad day in American politics, for I am sorry to tell you that I have tried again, and failed in vain, to bring in gun reform. A promise to you the American public, a promise I made before my election, as I believe it is the number one killer within our country and its citizens. And it needs to be stamped out, for I believe that the wind has changed, and reform will be the only way that we'll be able to eradicate the criminal activities of organized crime in our great country, which is starting to take a strong hold of our nation. So for every man, woman and child, I beseech you to be vigilant! If you see something wrong, please report it, for only the just will win this war against crime. Do not let the criminals win. Hello and welcome back to Breaking News, this is Tim Vine from CNB News reporting to you another incredible story about billionaire William Bard, heir to the Bard Corporation, who was just jailed for 123 years at New York Supreme Court, just 18 months after being sent to Bedlam Asylum for 11 years. In reality William Bard should be dead. But that William Bard was no normal man. As a billionaire, he was able to buy his way out of the electric chair, choosing instead the option of being frozen alive. Went out with his right-hand man Oswald, Wynchapel did. It was time for another person to step into that position, and claim the Bard billions. Mayor Patrick O'Donnel was that man. First he had to defrost him. Remember, William Bard is in there. We want him out alive! Wynchapel's had use of his money long enough! It's my turn now! Are you sure you want to do this, Mayor? It's too late, Webber. Wynchapel is dead, McMillian has killed him. What was Wynchapel doing in this place? Cryogenics. He kept Bard alive so he could filter his money. If he were dead, the infrastructure of his companies would have dissolved, and so would the cash. With Wynchapel gone I can take over, but keep Bard frozen at all costs! Okay, you're the boss. Well get the bastard billionaire out of there! We've got him at last! This is Tim reporting from Breakmount Cryogenetic High Security Prison in Queens, New York. And I can now confirm that no less than one hour ago, a group of men broke into this facility behind me. There is no news as of yet if anything was damaged or stolen, as authorities have not confirmed or denied this report. Webber, you called? I must be mad being here! He's got informants everywhere! So, Weasel, is William Bard at the Metropolitan Wharf, or is my information wrong? Yeah. Okay, you can go now. But we had a deal! Well if I need to kill William Bard, I'll throw in the mayor as well, how does that sound? Just do it, soon! Hello, Mayor, good of you to come! "For now is the winter of our discontent. Made glorious summer by this son of York." I didn't come here to listen to this shit! "...buried, our brows bound with victorious wreaths, "Our bruised arms hung up for monuments. "Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings, "Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. "Grimvisag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front, "And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds "to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly..." What the fuck is this? "But I, that am not shap'd for sportive tricks, "I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty, "to strut before a wanton ambling nymph! I, that am curtail'd..." "By dissembling nature. Deform'd, unfinish'd, - Shit! - "And that so lamely and unfashionable "that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. "So why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, "I have no delight, to spy upon my shadow, "and descant on mine own deformity, "since I will not be proved a lover, I will be proved... a villain!" Betrayal, however slight, Mayor, is not acceptable! Shit! I wasn't talking, to you! Hello and welcome back to Breaking News! This is Tim Vine from CNB News. We just received a report from the New York Supreme Court that a verdict against Mayor Patrick O'Donnel has just come in. Hello, Dan. Yes I can report that Mayor Patrick O'Donnel has been acquitted, after allegations of corruption. The verdict came in within just two hours. The 12-man jury was told by the mayor's attorney that there was no evidence to support this allegation, and that it was brought against his client, by government officials trying to stop his campaign from running for the White House this June. Amazing considering the evidence against the mayor. But after the main witness for the prosecution went missing, there was no other verdict to be given, but innocent. This is Chelsea Reese for CNB News at the Supreme Court in New York. As I watched the mayor come home, I knew it was time to pounce. As he was the only person that knew where William Bard was hiding. I've been waiting for you McMillian! - Where is he, man? - Who? That fucker, The Bard! You'll never catch him! I'll never tell you where he is! I'll turn your face into a colander! Fucking! You can't hurt me as much as he can! We'll see! Listen. Let me explain something to you about that wire in your mouth. It's hooked up to those charges back there. And if you don't tell me what I want to know, I'm gonna leave you here. And sooner or later, your jaw's gonna get tired, and it's gonna snap shut, or you're gonna try to call out to somebody, and your jaw's gonna snap shut. When that happens, you're gonna set off the grenades. And that missile is headed in a bad direction. You understand? Yeah? All right. So, where is that son of a bitch? - Mm! Mm-mm. - You're not gonna tell me? You sure? Absolutely sure? Whew, you better think twice about that. Mm, mnh-mnh. I guess I'll have to go, find somebody who'll tell me what I want to know. Oh, by the way, if you think that you're just gonna wait until somebody comes to save you... well, that ain't gonna happen either. You see that little candle over there? Mmm... In about three minutes, you're all done anyway. Mayor. Oh my goodness, what a way to go. Mind if I have this? Oh, , that's kind of nifty. I love weapons. Adios. You bastard! Now that's what I call a star spangled banner. New York at night is like a beautiful gift, all lit up like a Christmas tree in December. Unless you're looking for that someone who doesn't want to be found. Then you have to shift through the filth to find what you need. That was Little Odessa, once a home for immigrant families looking for a safe place to live. Now it's home for one defrosted billionaire by the name of William Bard, who is trying to escape the long arm of the law. As I searched the city for William Bard's men, who were all but dead. I feel proud of what I've achieved. To the point where I've realized maybe it's time to hang up my hat and coat, become a normal person again, stop being a vigilante. Maybe have a normal life with picket fences, two kids, where I read the kids bedtime stories before they go to bed. Unfortunately, life isn't like that. It's too late to go back to the police force after my time in the sewer. Killing all the rats that worked for William Bard. I think Tenison was right, it would be good to go out to dinner with someone of the opposite sex, relax like a normal person, maybe get drunk and fool around a little as the night comes to a close. For fighting crime isn't all it's made out to be. Bruises aren't just on the outside, but inside as well. But when I think of all the pain and suffering that William Bard has caused... So as the sunshine comes up, I drive through the countryside without smog and filth. The time has come to stop and slow down... enjoy the fresh air. Subtitles by explosiveskull
