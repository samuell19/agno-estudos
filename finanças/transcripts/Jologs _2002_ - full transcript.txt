Your application for scholarship has been denied. You have to pay the tuition in full, 8,000 pesos. [Faith] Good morning, sister. Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior? How did that happen? Last year, I was a full scholar. Now, you're taking away my scholarship? Last semester, you didn't declare your father's income. But my father doesn't live with us, and he doesn't pay for my schooling. Even so, it's all the same. I don't know what his income is. We don't even talk. I'm sorry. Next! Samson! [student assistant yawns] [student assistant] You have to pay the 3,000 peso balance. [both grunting] -Man, I'm sorry. Sorry. -It's okay, man. All right. [student assistant] Just head to accounting -and fix your problem. -[rubber stamp thumps] Buy your mussels here! They're fresh! Why not ask your father for the money? Grandma, I don't want to. Surely, he can afford your 8,000 peso tuition. No way. When Mom died, he didn't even help out. And now you want me to go to him and beg? -How much are these? -Fifty pesos. -Are these fresh? -They're fresh from Cavite. Ruben, your anger is not going to pay for your tuition. -[woman] How much? -Fifty pesos. [woman] Can you give me a discount? It's already dirt cheap. See how big they are? Go on, see for yourself.

[Trigger] Hey, Ruben, help me out here! Ruben! Ruben, what's going on in there? Uh, nothing, boss. -So, what took you so long? -Sorry. -Can you open this? -I can try. Go give it a try then. Hey, Mando! Come on time later! Boss Trigger! The supplies are here! Where do you want them? What the hell, Juanito? Are you shouting at me? No, boss! -Put them in the stockroom! -Sorry, boss!

Is this the office of Mr. Morales? Uh, one brewed coffee, to go. Is that so? Well, can you give me his office number instead? Hello. Can you step on it? I'm in a hurry. You can't? But this is very important. Uh, Ruben, you're here to serve coffee, not talk on the phone. Where's the manager? -I want to talk to him now. -He just left. -Can I have your order? -[scoffs] Not listening! Brewed coffee. -So? -[sighs] Hurry up. [scoffs] My goodness. Jerk. [scoffs] Miss, here's your coffee. Here. Ah, miss, do you have a smaller bill? I don't have change for this. I can't accept this. What? Your store is open 24 hours and you don't have change? I'm really sorry, but my boss just took all the cash. [Iza] Well, that's your problem! Miss, maybe you should just return the coffee. Or maybe you want a hot coffee bath. Or maybe I'll call security. Give it to me. [both grunting] Go ahead. If this spills on the floor, you're paying for it. [Ruben scoffs] Oh, my goodness, are you trying to save on sugar? This needs more sugar, it's so bland. [scoffs] Miss, here's your coffee. Thank you. Arjen! I'll just go look for change. -Cover for me, will you? -Sure thing. Thank you.

But it's guaranteed to stop my date in his tracks. You are such a tease! Since we're close and all, I can tell you this. You are setting yourself up for disappointment. Is that so? I know that he's, like, this walking wet dream, but he's also very conservative. Correct! And when he finds out that you are not at all demure-- -You might as well give up. -[chuckles] But then again, he's still a guy complete with lustful desires. This is all I have to say. Before this night is over, I'll have him feeding off the palm of my hands. I wouldn't bet on it. You're gonna come home defeated. Is that so? We're betting on this? All right!

And to God... They're in here. [Iñigo] And I hope she would join us in the future. As of now, she has strayed away from the right path. But she wants to change for the better. She wants to straighten up her life. She wants to be nearer to God. You know, deep inside, she really is a good person. Really? [laughs] Although sometimes, she seems to lack a bit of breeding. That's why I brought her here. Brothers and sisters... You should all mind your own business! Breeding? What the heck do I need breeding for? What am l? A dog? I could be a bitch sometimes, I admit that. In fact, I'm proud of it. lf you think I'm evil, that's my problem, okay? And you don't have the right to tell me what I should or shouldn't! [screams] You have no right! You're all a bunch of douche bags! Sis, are you okay? There, you won. Brothers and sisters... Let us resume praising the Lord! Five, six, seven, eight... ♪ Alive, alive Alive forevermore ♪ ♪ My savior is alive Alive forevermore ♪ ♪ Alive, alive Alive forevermore ♪ ♪ My savior is alive... ♪ Let me explain. Iza, wait. Stay away from me, you bastard! You knew I was head over heels for you. That's why you easily fooled me. You made me believe you're attracted to me too. But you didn't. All you cared about was getting me to join that alive-alive group of yours. You want me to change because you think I'm a bad person? Why? Do you really know me? Iza, I'm sorry. Sorry? Sorry my ass! [sobbing] Iñigo, this is the way I am. This is the way I dress, this is the way I look, this is how I speak. This is me. But that does not make me a bad person. lf you can't accept me the way I am, then don't! I don't want to be with you either. ["Next In Line" instrumental version playing] Hi-yah! Joan, why can't I get you out of my mind? [woman] Kulas! Dino has been calling you all morning. He's going to wait for you at Cafe Barako. Yes, Mom! Happy birthday, man. Man, what took you so long? And why are you dressed like that? I thought we're going to play ball? I'm sorry. I've got somewhere to be. I'm meeting Joan in a while. But it's my birthday! I thought we're having some drinks later, too. I hope you'll understand. This is a special day for me and Joan. -[scoffs] What's up? -You want to know? -Whoa. Isn't this fake? -It's not fake! I saved up for it. And I'll give this to her later. Are you sure about this? Dino, I love your cousin so much. Don't worry about me. By the way, when are you going to introduce me to your mysterious girlfriend? Soon. Anyway! lf you change your mind, I'll just be at the basketball court. -Okay. Take care. -Okay. See you. -Joan! -Wait here. -Hi. -Hi. Um... Let's get married. Kulas, I cannot accept this. Why not? I'm graduating this March. I'll get a job. So, what seems to be the problem? That's not it. We both know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time now. Look, Joan, if you're not yet ready, I could wait even if it takes years. This could be our long engagement. Can't we just be friends? Kulas, I never meant to, but it just happened. It was never my intention to hurt you but... Our relationship's been dead for a long time. We just don't want to admit it to each other. [inhales] Joan, that's not true. [sighs] But it's true, Kulas. I don't feel anything for you anymore. And... I've fallen in love with someone else. [scoffs] [man] Joan, let's go. Let's go. Sorry. Sorry. [sighs] -Have you ever fallen in love? -I guess so. I mean truly in love? Not just crushes, especially not lust. Maybe. I guess. It's scary to be in love that way. lf you say so. It's scary because... You become vulnerable. When I met your cousin, Joan, she just smiled at me. And then I fell... I no longer live for myself. I was living for her. Maybe it's not yet over between the two of you. What do you mean? Who knows, maybe you can reconcile. You think there's any chance of that? As long as there's life, there is hope. Okay, I'm going to the gym now. Joan's taekwondo practice should be over by now. -Thanks, man. -[chuckles] Once again, happy birthday. Thanks for the treat. You are such a big shot now. [giggles] Let's have coffee later. At Cafe Barako. -I'll be there. -It's my treat. [chuckles] [Joan giggling] So, what now?

["Next in Line" instrumental playing] -Happy Birthday. -Thank you, please come in. Um, I wanted to be the first to greet you a happy birthday. Is that all? Uh... We have a prayer meeting tonight. Maybe you'd like to come? [Dino] What? Okay. Is there anything else? I should go, I have to finish enrolling today. Bye. [grunts] [woman] So, what seems to be the problem? I think my boyfriend wants to have sex. [scoffs] But do you? I'm not sure. Sometimes, I think I want to. -Hm... -Especially when... Especially when he takes off his shirt. I feel like he's seducing me or something. [scoffs] Do you think you're ready to have sex? I don't know. How long have you been together? Six months. And up to now, all I've gotten are kisses on the cheeks. Six months? I feel like I'm on an abstinence diet. You must really be aching for it? It's all I think about! I suspect that she's only interested in me because I came from the seminary. -Well, do you love her? -Yeah. Of course. Then you should be willing to wait and do without sex for a while. [scoffs] lf God did not intend for people to have sex, then why did He give us all these carnal feelings and desires? Sex in itself is not a bad thing. I think of it as God's gift to people. But there's a proper time for it. You should only do it when you feel ready. Maybe I should ask God for a sign... [bells chiming] So I'll know if it's the right time for it. [scoffs] [sighs] -[car beeping] -[tires screeching] [object bangs] And now, let's listen to the testimony of Sister Faith. This afternoon I witnessed an accident. I don't know if this is a sign from God. But it made me think. This life that God gave us is so short. We should all do whatever it is that we want to do. We shouldn't wait for tomorrow. Because tomorrow may never come. Brothers and sisters, meet our new friend, Sister Iza. Let's all sing a welcome song for Sister Iza. Dear... Do you think Dino will like the baked mussels that I prepared for him? Of course he will. That's his favorite. Maybe, I should go to Dino's apartment ahead of you? Okay, I'll drop you off there first. Then I'll go to the pastry shop and pick up the birthday cake. That's a very good idea, dear. He'll be so surprised. My precious little boy. ♪ I can almost see ♪ ♪ Heaven ♪ ♪ When I held you ♪ ♪ On my arms ♪ ♪ Do I really deserve ♪ ♪ The love you gave me ♪ ♪ The love that we share ♪ ♪ I tried so many times ♪ ♪ To win your heart ♪ ♪ So that you'll be mine ♪ ♪ At last ♪ [sighs] Dino? Dino, son! Mom, what are you doing here? [Dino whispers] Pass it here. I just want to greet you happy-- I thought you and Dad had this thing to go to? -Dino, why won't you let me in? -Mom! I just want to greet you. But I'm not dressed yet. Well, you've nothing to hide from me. -Mom! -Just kidding. -Mom! Don't-- -[Faith shrieks] What did I tell you, son? You never did know how to clean up your room. Just look at this! It's like a pigpen! This apartment is just on loan to you from your uncle. And it's so dark in here. Let's turn on the lights. Where's the switch? Oh, my goodness, son. -Come on. Get up already. -Mom! What are you doing? Wear your pants. -I can do this myself, Mom! -Let me. -I can do it! -Hurry, stand up! -[Dino's mom] What? -Oh, no! What was that? [shrieks] There are lots of ghosts here. Just ignore it. Did I tell you that I went to church earlier today? And you know what we talked about? What? We talked about the young people of today. Immorality is so rampant among the young. There is a proliferation of premarital sex. Girls as young as 14, 15, find themselves pregnant. That's why I brag about how proud I am to be your mother. My son is so kind... -[shrieks] What's that? Anyway, I talked to some of your former teachers from the seminary. You did? They want me to wish you a happy birthday. Wait. I have to use the bathroom first. -What are we going to do? -Here's what we'll do. I'll convince mom to go down to the coffee shop. The one down the corner. When we leave, I'll turn off the lights. That will be our signal that it's safe for you to step out. When I turn off the lights, you step out. Got it. Your clothes are under the bed. -Help me get up. -Okay. -Dino, hurry up! -Mom... -The toilet's broken. -I need to go now. Mom, the toilet's broken. Broken? But didn't you just use it? It broke all of a sudden. Mom, I wouldn't go in there. Things are spewing out of the toilet. Mom, we better go down to the coffee shop. The bathroom's clean over there. And their coffee tastes great. You startled me, son. We can't leave now. Your dad is on his way here. Dad has a cell phone. We can call him. [doorbell rings] Dad? Happy birthday, son. Your elevator is out of order again. I'll get you a glass of water. Be right back. [Dino's mom murmuring] Something's up with Dino. He's fidgety and all. Where's my clothes? I'll talk to him. -Dino, you're so clumsy. -Dad, I'm sorry! You've got your Dad's shirt all wet. -I told him I'm sorry. -It's okay. It's okay. I'll get a towel from the bathroom. -Okay. -Dad! -Dad, Dad! -My son... I've got here, baked mussels. Your favorite. Have you had dinner yet? Tastes good, doesn't it? Very fresh. Open your mouth. There we go. What's wrong, son? I'll get you water. Dad. -[phone rings] -[Dino's mom murmuring] Son, let's talk. So, have you decided if you want to go back to the seminary? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I'm still confused. Just remember that no matter what, your mother and I will always love you. I understand that you are in a confusing age. That you are not sure about things. Just remember that God only created man and woman... And nothing in between. Dear, Dino, what are you still doing there? Come over here. Mom, Dad, let's go over to the coffee shop. It'll be my treat. [whispers] They're here. Okay, you can come out after I've turned off the light. Mom, let's go to the coffee shop. Come over here, son. Mom... Close your eyes. Close your eyes. [gasps] Surprise! Mom, Daddy, this is Faith. My girlfriend. Yes! Happy birthday! Faith! [Kris] Let's now welcome our lucky text partners. Arjen, I have an emergency at home. Tell Mando that I cannot wait for him. Okay. -Wait! -Let's go home, please. [host on TV] Either 2 million or 300,000 pesos may be won by our text partners. Thank you. But that was my change. How come you took it? -Do you have a stirrer? -Ouch! Why did you take my change? -It's my change. You owe me. -Give me my change. [both arguing] One mochaccino, hot, tall please. I'll be waiting for my order at that table. [host on TV murmuring] Wait a minute. I know you. Is this seat taken? Mind if I join you and wait for my order? Go ahead. -Why are you all wet? -Boss, it's a long story. -Hurry up then. -I'll just change. Regular coffee. Shet. Such a small world, isn't it? Don't you think so? More often than not I know someone you know too, or I have a relative who's related to someone important. Motherfucker! -My boyfriend's mother fainted. -Really? But that's okay. That faggot is going to die. He'd better not show his face around here. I just realized that I don't need to do anything that I'm not yet quite ready for. [shrieks] Mando? You know, our experiences aren't all that different. Even if I'm head over heels for Iñigo, I wouldn't change, not even for him. [host on TV] Under the supervision of DTI representatives... I bet Iñigo won't be showing up at our Christian gathering after what you did. What a night! Check out that guy over there. [Faith] He looks familiar. Yes, he's in my boyfriend's basketball team. See, I was right. [host on TV] Before we reveal the correct answer, we give you our winning six-letter combination. We are all connected. There are no accidents. There are no coincidences. You know that? See, it's like this. We are all related one way or another. We affect each other. What you do affects me. Somewhere. Somehow. Sometime. Don't you think so? I hope you understand, boss. I got caught in traffic on my way here. Mando, that's not my problem. [TV host murmurs] Of course, we are all God's creatures. We were created for each other. Like they say, no man is an island. Amen, sister. You're fired! What are you waiting for? Get out of my sight! You prick. Stop it. Don't you dare! You! Are you gonna help him? [TV host] Our lone winner wins two-million pesos. He is Juanito Hechanova from Quezon City. Yes! I won. That's me Kris! Go ahead. Shoot! I said shoot! [grunts] [in Bisaya] My life has no more meaning. [in Filipino] She's left me. [in Bisaya] You're scared, aren't you? I won! I won! I won! You ungrateful son of a bitch. Shoot! You don't have the balls, do you? -You sissy. -You're nothing, Mando! Go ahead! You're nothing but a security guard, moron! I won! I won! -What now, huh? -I won! [Faith shrieking] Oh, my God! [screams] Faith! Boss! Kulas, meet Faith, my girlfriend. Faith, nice meeting you.
