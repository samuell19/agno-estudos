Arvind, pass it over to me! Chinmin, what are you doing? - Pass! - Kick properly! Here! Kick! Here! Pass the ball over here! One who accepts defeat, is of low resolute. One that steps back, is a traitor. One who accepts defeat, is of low resolute. One that steps back, is a traitor. It's no longer about me. It's about your duty. Only you know what's in your heart. Don't be ignorant. It's human to err. Don't be a human. Only you know what's in your heart. Don't be ignorant. With the earth... At my feet. I've set out. With a belief. I'm on my own. With no one by my side. But I have you... O God. It's no longer about me. It's about your duty. Only you know what's in your heart. Don't be ignorant. It's human to err. Don't be a human. Only you know what's in your heart. Don't be ignorant. Which way is Tagore Boys Hostel? Take a left from here. Hey, come on! Show me. What the... Sorry, bro. So, you're finally here. Great. Now that you made it this far, why don't you hop onto your bed? This is my bed. And yes, this ball is mine as well. Keep it here. Come on! Hurry up and tie your turban. What a weird guy! He keeps staring at a half-nude sardar. Boys these days have no manners at all. Lord, did you have to give me him as my roommate? What are you staring at? Have you never seen underwear with bananas? Let me tell you. If you hadn't shown up for another day, I would've rented out your bed. And you would've had to sleep outside. I hope you understand. Now look, that closet is mine and this one's yours. Okay? Keep your stuff on your side. Got it? No throwing stuff on each other's bed. Okay? I mean... after today. Does the turban look okay? Nice. Oh, no! Dude, I am late. Don't be late for class, okay? Does he speak at all? Wasim, look ahead. - No, not now! - That's alright! Hey, someone shut his mouth! Seems you're full. Sir's here. Sir's here. Hey, move! - That's my roommate. - Hey, I'll beat you! Let it be. - Yes! - Is that him? - I haven't seen him. - He's just arrived today. I wonder why he doesn't speak! I tried to strike a conversation with him, but he wouldn't stop staring at me. What have you done to the class? Baby, did you have dinner? Baby, did you drink water? Baby, did you take your pills? That's nonsense! Please ask him what he wants. Ishwar! Look, your roommate! - Uncle, don't worry. I am here. - Okay. Brother! They're not good. - Do you have samosa, Uncle? - Yes. Okay! Samosa is good. You will love it. So, you can talk? Oh, you're not dumb. You're not dumb? Uncle, he's not dumb. Why didn't you say anything back then? I tried so hard to talk to you earlier. You didn't give me a chance to speak. I see! That is possible... but I thought you were dumb. She's got courage, dude. Pass me the water. I am thirsty. What's your name? Don't you forget it! Come, let me introduce you to my friends. Guys, he's not dumb. That's Rohan. She's Komal. That's Utkarsh. This is Kshitij. And she's Pooja. Because you're Ishwar's roommate. Even God can't save you now. We'll go to Manipur as well. You can go with him. - Sure! - You were asking about Manipur, right? Manipur is a great place for sightseeing. I know it's an awesome place. Believe me. - It's really nice. - Yeah, alright! What's wrong with him? - Go ahead, I'll see you later. - Fine, see you. What's wrong? Don't you want to go? Registration dates are long gone. Let's go. - Come on! - Forget it. I'll go back to the room. Why? What's wrong? I don't want to attend the lectures. You must be tired because of the long journey. Don't worry. Go and sleep. - I'll mark your attendance, okay? - Yeah! And yes sleep in your own bed. And don't forget to eat. Oh, Lord... Who are they? Your mom and dad? - Yes. - Great! You're carrying Manipur with you, aren't you? It feels like home. Like home? That's nice! So, why come so far to study? There must be good colleges back home as well. What is that dream, bro? - Forget it, man. - How can I forget it, dude? Tell me. I want to become a national level footballer. Someday, I want to play for the Indian team as well. And this is the top college for football. That's why, I came here. That's great. You're at the right place. Why are you still sulking? Because I saw the notice. The registration dates. I see! The registration board is what discouraged you. I got it. How will you go for the trials now? I mean... without the game... Why won't you play, bro? You know what? You don't need to worry when you've got me as your roommate. Doesn't matter if you couldn't register your name. We'll get it done tomorrow. Don't worry. Consider the job done. Now that you've successfully pleased me you're bound to get rewarded. Right? Hey, very good! Keep it up! Bravo! Harder! Bravo! Bravo! Harder! Harder! Cover him! Come on! Mom? Hello, Mom! I can't hear you. Hello, Mom! I can't hear you. Yes, I can hear you now. I am fine, Mom. Yeah... I've been feeling a little weak since I started dieting. Yes, I only eat five pieces of bread without butter. Yes, really! That's all! I am not lying, Mom. Football isn't going from my life anytime soon. Stop worrying about me. Take care of yourself. I'll see you next when I come to Rajpura. Take care, okay? Oh, Mom! - Hello, sir. - What are you doing? I was taking your blessings. I was... - Bless you. - Thank you. - Son... - Sir, he... Does it look nice that the chair's all the way there and your sir's here? Go, get the chair for me. What's this? Go! It's tangy. - What is this? - Sir, it's Red Bull. - Oh... energy drink? - Yes. I am low on energy, anyway. Come on, drink it. Sir, he is my friend. He arrived two weeks late. He wants to try out for football. Do I look like a registrar to you to register his name? That guy sitting there... Parth. Introduce him to Parth. He will help you out. And I've made one thing very clear to all of you. I take rest after four o'clock. I get tired. Now I am on a break, okay? - Now, leave! - Yes, sir. No sense of time! Come on! Come on! Come on, boys. - Let's go, guys! - Come on! What happened? Sir, he is my friend, and he joined the college two weeks late. He wants to try out for football. - I am late, because... - But the registration's closed. You can try next year. I can't help it. It's closed. Like I said, they are genuine guys. They will follow the rules, right? - Hey, Parth! - Sir, just a second! If you can't pass the ball with your hands, how on earth will you do it with your feet? Open your eyes. Use your peripheral vision. Look for space, your players. Take everything into account. Show some energy. - I am tired, Parth. Can I go? - Go, sir. I've asked him to get Electral powder for you. Don't worry! Okay, thank you. - I can feel my stomach grumbling. - Okay. Great! Listen! I've seen it in the movies. They do a somersault and kick the ball, and it goes soaring. You should do that. The coach will be impressed, and you'll get selected. Block him. Block him. Fine, don't do it. Come on! Come on! Clean movement, dude! - Come on! - Pass it here! Come on, keep it down! You guys played really well today. Bravo! Show this energy every day. Very good! - I'll talk to sir. - Of course, go ahead. Come on. I told you registration is closed. Come back next year. Sir, next year... - Why are you 15 days late? - There was an earthquake in Manipur. Sir, all commutes had shut down. Hello! Send four samosas for me. Send ice cream as well. We'll settle the bill later. Send it, quickly. Yes? I get really stressed whenever I see you. You don't eat or drink. You're so boring. Did you read today's newspaper? "Buffalo in deep waters." The MLA's buffalo is missing. The entire state's police are looking for it. Isn't that great news? What's great is that there was an earthquake in Manipur where a thousand people died, and nobody cares about it. Oh, who told you? - One of our players is from East. - I see! - Where's the list? - Which list? - The list of players. - This is the one. Here you go. Here you go. What is he writing? Have a samosa, at least? No? It's alright, I'll have it then. So... I got your name registered, didn't I? What? These guys can't play like you. - You can strikeout my name... - Let's go! Even if five of them get selected, got it? Oh... come on! Move! Good morning, sir. It's been a state champion 18 times. Here, we've had 32 national players out of which 11 have represented India on an international level. All those players were once standing where you guys are standing right now. And there was only one thing on their mind. The same thing which is on everyone's mind. Am I right? Louder! How many of you think you're the best? Do you think you're the best? - Are you really the best? - I am, sir. So, you've decided that you're the best. Then, you don't need to give this trial because you're already the best. That's not what I meant. - I think I am. - You think? I mean I am, sir. Are you the best, or do you think you're the best? Sometimes you say you're the best, sometimes you think you're the best. Or you're in denial. What does the "best" mean? Come on, tell me! It means a "full stop." Game over! Because there's nothing beyond the "best." The team is at this level, because all those players have achieved something. They did it because... Why did they do it? So, all those who think they are the best... - Come on. - Thank you, sir. Come on! Sir, here's the entire list. Wow... bravo! Come on. Get him. Pass the ball. Sir, these boys are real champions. One more! One more! Pass the ball. This way, Lukram! Shoot! Shoot! Hello, Mom! Son, it's so late! Why haven't you slept? Are you not well? Mom, it's late in Manipur. It's not late here. How did your trials go? Have you had dinner? Mom, the trials... the trials were good. I'm feeling well. I'm about to have my dinner. Why so late? You generally sleep around this time. Mom, it's just the difference of time. People are the same here. Really, Mom! How's Dad doing? He's doing well. Is he still angry? Just concentrate on your football! Okay! I will, Mom! You draw really well. I have not been able to attend Lai Harouba ever since I've come here. I miss being back home, man. By the way, what are you doing so far from home? I came here for football. What do you mean? You'll get to know after being here for a while. Let's go, it will be fun! - I don't like being in a crowded place. - Why? I know these people. Sometimes, you think they can be friends, you know? In fact, my advice to you is stay away from these people. They are all nice people. Fine! I'll see you around. Yeah, okay. Bye. Sure! Have a seat! What is this, sir? The list of selected team? Please, read it. Sir, there's one good player's name missing from the boys' trial list. I am sorry, sir. Without informing you, I... The happiness you get after reading such news is incomparable. True, sir. Makes you proud when our players, our boys move ahead in life, represent the country. Sir, he's a good guy... Parth, what happens when someone passes the ball late in football? Whether it's a late pass or a late registration the result is one and the same. Anyway, if you insist, you can keep him on the team. - And you? - Yes, sir. - When will you do us the honor? - May I go? Yes, sir? You can go, Baljeet. You have to understand that you're not just a player anymore. You're a coach. Try to understand your responsibility. If you don't follow the rules and regulations, then how will you set an example? Don't take advantage of that, Parth. I will keep in mind, sir. I promise. I met Pele in South Africa's canteen. I said, "Pele, someday you will make it big." Sir is here. Get back to work. Always wasting time in useless chatter! Stand straight. So, this is our new team? Come on, brother! Come on, bro! Parth, give him the good news. A new league has been announced in UP in order to promote football. The backers are good. In fact, they are very good. And the league's starting from Lucknow. That's great, but we have only two months. And... SRMU should be holding this trophy. - I'm coming, boy! - You know what? - Yes, sir? - Let these new boys play with you. Parth, do me a favor. Fix a practice match with a good club. Then, we'll see. Dude! The coach really wore us out. - Let's go to the auditorium. - Yeah, let's go. Guys, I am going to my room. - Why? - What will I do in the auditorium? Okay, see you! - What's with him? - Your wish. Why are we going to the auditorium? Pooja just texted me. She's rehearsing in the auditorium. - I see! - Hey! I am coming as well. What will I do in the room? - What a weird guy! - Yes, dude! - Come on! - Come, I'll introduce you to Pooja. "When you look at me, I know I know you want to say something to me." Yes, right! Forget it, it's over. Yeah, yeah, alright! - Hey, keep quiet! She's rehearsing. - I know! Lukram! Come here. - Please come here! - Go on, she's calling you. Come on, go! "I know you want to say something to me." Yes. Help me rehearse this dialogue. Just give me a cue from here, okay? I've been trying to tell you something for the last couple of days. I know, you secretly look at me from the crowd, and become conscious when I look back at you. And I know... you have a lot to say as well. But you can't. You know what? I want to hear it today. For us. For me. And. I love you! What? Give me the lines. "I've been trying to." I completely forgot. You don't know how to read Hindi. It's okay. Give it back. Go, sit down. - Help me rehearse these lines. - Oh, God! Now - I've got to help her rehearse her lines. - Go, brother! If you rehearse with Lukram, then your play won't happen until next year. - Now, tell me the dialogues. - Yes, okay. I've been trying to tell you something for a couple of days. What happened? Doesn't matter if you don't know Hindi. Look at me. I am Ishwar, and I don't know French. It's not a big deal. Look at Pooja! And skirt eyes when I look back at you. - She doesn't know Manipuri. - I know... - But you know Manipuri. - Go ahead? That's how it is. Don't gloat over such trivial things. "You have a lot to say to me." I know you have a lot to say to me. That's Kshitij. And that's Pooja. What a goal! Wow! You couldn't ask. And I couldn't tell. You couldn't ask. And I couldn't tell. The things between us. Remained unsaid. Wonder when... We'll meet again! Is this the one? You couldn't ask. And I couldn't tell. You couldn't ask. And I couldn't tell. The things between us. Remained unsaid. Bravo! Watch how you're playing! Why don't you play properly? Yeah, okay. What are you coming here for? To do this? Where is your focus? I was beginning to feel. Secure around you. It lasted only for a moment. And now, I am all alone again. I was beginning to feel. Secure around you. It lasted only for a moment. -And now, I am all alone again -Pass it to me! Pass! I couldn't tell you. That you make me feel restless. My heart's sad now. And the rift has increased. Wonder when... We'll meet again! You couldn't ask. And I couldn't tell. You couldn't ask. - Be gentle! - And I couldn't tell. The things between us. Remained unsaid. "Dear, Pooja!" - What are you hiding? - Nothing. - You're hiding something. - It's nothing. It's definitely something. I saw it, bro. Show me. Oh, no! It got torn! Wait, wait! What's written here? "Dear, Pooja!" Really? Who wrote this? What the. I mean, wow! It's great! All this is going on, and Ishwar doesn't even know. Wow! You're a stud! Small eyes and big dreams. You should've told me that you like Pooja. I would've helped you out. You know what? Come with me. I'll take you to see Pooja. Let's go! Dude, whatever you say say it with confidence, okay? And look into her eyes when you're talking. That's how you impress girls. It makes your heart beat faster. So, take care. You really love her, don't you? Okay! Don't worry. If you fumble again while speaking Hindi just don't fret. You have written everything in the letter, right? Well, how do I look? - Do I look good? - Yes, go for it. - Okay, thanks. - You'll do great. See you, Rocket. - Actually, I... - What is it, Lukram? - It's important. - Okay, fine, but make it quick. My entry is next. Say it? Hurry up, Lukram. I am next on stage. And... I've written my feelings in this letter. It's in Hindi. You learned Hindi for me, and I respect that. I'll keep this. But I don't feel the same for you. I hope you understand. My entry's next. Here, have a sip. Take it. Don't be so sad. Your situation reminds me of my breakup. Really! Ishwar was in love once. Someone broke Ishwar's heart. See... God, help me! She's the one. Isn't she cute? Then, there's this one. She broke my heart as well. What's wrong with my choice? Ishwar... stop it, buddy. Anyway, the practice match is coming up. And then, the tournament. I'll do double practice. From now on, I am going to devote all my time to football. Now you spoke like a true champion! So what if Pooja's not in your life? We have football. We brothers will bring the cup home in this tournament. And you'll become the "Man of the Tournament." Don't forget. Then, Pooja will know what she has lost. Got it? Look at that smile! Parth... this is our team. Let's go, come on! - Who are these kids? - I wonder who they are! They look like a charity case to me. Then, let's do some charity... of five goals. Pass it! Come on, pass it! Easy! Easy! Take it! Come on, dude! Hey, what are you doing? Cover him! - Pay attention to the lines! - Yes, come on! Look at him! This way! Take it from the left, dude! What are you doing? Check it! Run! Run! Run! Oh, no! That's the man! Now, that was fun! Nice! Keep it to your right, your right! Come on, Ashish. We can still take the lead. - This way! - This way! Come on! Come on, nice! Pass ahead! Pass ahead! - This way! - Catch him! Pass! Time for header! Come on! - Get lost! - Shut up! - Stay back. Stay back. - It's a foul! Relax! - Don't come any close! - Step back! Stick to playing football! It's not wrestling. Dude! Hit a goal. Go ahead! Ishwar, go for it! It's just halftime. Yeah, but the score is 1-0. You guys are taking them lightly. You guys are taking them lightly. I don't want to see the ball in our half! Proxy, defense is really good. Just keep an eye on their striker. Cut when they are in the open! Be positive, man! You must win by 3-1. Got it? Come on! - Yes, sir! - Good! Good! Take it away! Here, here! Pass it! Come on, Ishwar. Yes, Ishwar! Come on, nice! Nice! Come on! Send Lukram. Come on, son. You can do it! Hey, it's okay! Yes? Come on, hurry up! Pass the ball! Lukram, get the ball! Hey, Chinky! Come on! Come on, do it! Why did sir send him? - Sir, that was our goal. - Our goal? - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me before? - Come on, guys. - Move! Move! Get the ball! Get the ball! Oh, no! You should be ashamed. Why does everyone look so disappointed? Why couldn't you guys perform out there? If you had tried harder... You all have brought shame upon us! They made a joke out of us. It's so awful! We got humiliated in front of the entire college. And now, we'll again have to face the humiliation outside. We shouldn't have misjudged those kids. We ruined everything. Those kids beat us bad! - And now, Vikram will take our case! - Oh, really? What did Vikram do? Tell me. He sent him. He has never practiced on the left wing, but he sent him out there to play in that position. And you're worried about what he'll say! Why couldn't you just speak up, and say that you can't play on the left wing? Quiet! Hey, Chinky! You missed so many chances. Keep quiet. What did you say? What did you say before that? - Bro, bro... - I am just talking. I am just talking. Step back! Sit down. Sit. So... what should we call you? Who are you? Who is he? Hey, look here! Who is he? Where is he from? Tell me! Where is he from? Speak up! You're from Manipur. Did you hear that? And this is Lucknow. You're being given a chance to play, and that's a big opportunity for you. Got it? Remember! I'll break your legs if you don't behave! Look down! Look down! And listen stay within your limits, got it? Otherwise, we will kick you out. - Bro, please... - You better talk some sense into him! - Otherwise... - I got it. - Brother. - Sir's here. Tomorrow morning, five o'clock, on the field. Didn't you get enough sleep? Come on. Come on. Don't stop! Get up. Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Boys, you're getting too slow. Come on! Stand far from the goal! - Tired already? - Yes, sir. A little tired. Do you want to get punished? Leave! Get off. If you don't hydrate yourself you're bound to get cramps. Yes? Which leg did you use to run? Which leg did you use to run? Left or right? You run and walk using both your feet. - How will you play football? - Using both my feet, sir. Don't exert yourself. Tomorrow morning, come an hour earlier. Come on, keep it up. Come on. Come on, man! More energy. Why do we play football? Because we like it. Left foot, man! Football is a privilege. It's your dream. Put your heart into it! Use this... the inside of the foot. It's quite nice to see you on this side of the field again. Whichever side I am on, football is football, sir. - How are you, Mr. Chaudhary? - All good, Mr. Singh. I just show up for formality. I am not required here as long as you're here. I know you'll select the best team. Come on, guys. The selection process is about to begin. Yeah... Come on! What the... Sir, should we start? - Sure? - Yes! In your position. Come on, tackle. Careful! - Look out! - Pass the ball! Maintain your position! Block Lukram. Block Lukram. He'll manage on the left. Ishwar, pass the ball! The boy on the right wing is the right choice. Keep the ball away from the defender. He's trying to act smart. We'll think of something. Come on. - Pass it here! - Nice. - The guy playing on the right. - Yeah? I think he's better on the left. - That one? - Yeah. Lukram, shoot! Sir, Lukram's playing better than before. Aakash plays at that position. We'll have to change it. Okay. Let's see. Come on! What are you guys doing? It's a goal, man! Do you want to make a hole in the wall? Yes, Kshitij. Tell me. - Where are you, Ishwar? - Coming, I am coming. I am sorry, I completely forgot about it. I'm coming. Come, quickly. We've to get the stuff. And listen, come alone. - We'll pick up Lukram later. - Hold on a sec! Listen, there's a party in our room, so don't go anywhere. You don't drink, so what should I get for you? What are you saying? I wasn't talking to you. Just hold on. Why do you look so stressed? Just chill. The trials are over. I'll get a Red Bull for you. See you! I am coming. Where are you? - Waiting for you downstairs. - I am almost there. Come soon. Did that hurt? Did it? Come. That's no way to hit him. Hit him like this. And if you want to break his leg... Catch the scoundrel! - Bloody Lukram! - Wait! Come here, you scoundrel! Beat him. Hold his hands. - You think you play well, right? - Leave me! - Guys, leave me! - Hold on! Lie him down here. Help me! - Hold him. - Hold him. - Move! - Break his leg, Ranjeet. Catch him. Come here. Where are you going, Chinky? Catch him, he's getting away. Come on! Let's go after him! What's all this? What happened? They want to kill me. Who? Who wants to kill you? The seniors. Ranjeet and Saurav. They must be looking for me. - Did they see you come here? - No. Come on! - Should I call Lukram? - Of course. Wait. He ran away. - Who ran away? - No one. You know, Ashish was supposed to get the chicken. But he must have left. - Yeah, exactly. - Yes! By the way, what did you get to eat? Nothing. Some chips. Have some water. - Who did you say? - Ranjeet and Saurav. What? Look. Do you think... they care for you? I've known them for three years. Why did you have to say that in front of him? - So, what should I do? - Why can't you keep quiet? Can't you see? Now, you know. They are all the same. Come with me, and file a complaint, okay? I hope you have learnt a lesson. Take your stuff and move in with me. Forget about Ishwar. When is the festival? I think it's on the 18th. Check out this chart, my name will be on it. There it is! - Biju! Bro! - What happened? My name isn't here. Wait. Let's check again. I made it. Is Mr. Parth inside? - He's in Mr. Vikram's office. - Okay. Sir, I don't get it. It's not about just any player. It's about a deserving player, sir. So, you think all the selected players are not deserving? Now, you're going to teach us the selection process? Sir... what was the selection based on? On the basis of the trials, right? And Lukram played well at the trials. We don't have time for discussion, Parth. The tournament is right around the corner. Get on with the practice. And do your job properly, okay? I'll get what I deserve. Sir, you said that I must understand the responsibility of a coach. What is my responsibility now, sir? My players deserve this chance. Lukram deserves it. He plays well. He's worked hard, sir. Have some water. Do you see this? What's common among all of them? They are the champions of SRMU. And what is SRMU? It's our university, sir. It's our home. Yours. Mine. Ours. Whenever you go to someone's house, whose picture do you see on the wall? For example, the walls of your house. Whose pictures do you hang there? We put up the pictures of our family on our walls. Not of the outsiders. Not of the neighbors. This state is my home, Parth. And I will only put up the pictures of my family on my wall. Not outsiders'. Take a good look at their faces. Do you see any outsider? What were you saying? We have many such players in our state, in our home. For example, you. That's why, your picture's up here. Here. If some outsider tries to take this place. I will never allow it. Sir, how does it matter? This is his home as well... This is not his home! This can never be their home. This is your home, Parth! Try to understand. That boy will not play for our team. Have some more. I made it especially for you. Your love and affection have spoiled him. What was all that sweet talk for? He has quit his dream. He hasn't won any medal. I had warned him that it won't be easy. Yet he ran away to become a big footballer. But I didn't know that he would come running back. I wonder what will happen to him! Hey! Lukram, what are you doing here? Did your coach give you the day off? - Sir, you're my coach. - That I am. And this is my ground. Sir, I belong here, not there. What's wrong, Lukram? Come on. Boys, he's my student. Now, he's studying in Lucknow. In SRMU. - SRMU? Same place where Lukram studies? - Yes. Do you know him? Have you ever met him? - Do you know Lukram? - Yes, I've heard about him. He used to play in our academy. Now, he plays for SRMU. Soon, he'll play for the Indian team as well. - Is he on a holiday here? - No, no, he isn't here. Okay. Now, you all can go. Game continue. Sir, why didn't you tell them that I am Lukram? I won't tell them. And you must not tell them either that you are Lukram. But why, sir? Because the Lukram they know is our hero. And you you're a loser. Look, you can do anything with your life. I won't say anything. But I can't let you play on this field. Because I don't want them to see you quit and follow in your footsteps. Got it? I don't want them to quit without playing, like you. You can leave now. Sorry, Dad! I'm running away again. This time, I am not running away, but I am running towards the situation. To face it. Come on. Yes? These people don't accept us. If I give up, and leave without playing then our people won't accept us either. What do you think? You'll request Vikram to let you be on the team again, and he'll do it? SRMU is the best way to get selected in the Indian team. There must be some other way. I am sure! I don't know, but everyone's against you. Who will help you out here? The same guy who's helping me from the beginning. He's Vikram's sycophant. - You think he will help you? - Yes, he will. Don't worry. Keep it up! Play the next ball, carefully. A player's life is so strange, Lukram. Insecurities at every stage. There's pain self-doubt, and a fight at every stage. There are registration and trials. There's more practice. Then the selections, and then fight again. And this fight is never-ending. It keeps getting intense until the player doesn't get tired and give up. It's been happening in front of my eyes for all these years. And now, I realized... You're not the first player who deserves a place in the team but isn't getting selected. I still remember my teammates. They played better football than I did. They would pour every ounce of their life in their game. But they never got selected. And now, it makes me want to puke. It wasn't their fault. It's this stupid system's fault. I idolized Mr. Vikram. It's alright, keep it up! I did as he said. But I can't be a part of this corrupt system. If you say that you want to fight, I am with you. Do you want to fight? Do you want to fight? Look at Mr. Sharma. Always engrossed in the newspaper. - Hello, Mr. Sharma. - Who is it? - How are you? - Hello. What brings you here? Nothing special, Mr. Sharma. - We're looking for a quick fix. - Quick fix? - Here? - Yes. Who's better than you when it comes to quick fix? Go on... do what you want! No, no... only you can help us here. How is that? I heard there's an open tournament in Lucknow. Enroll my team as well. I know that you're controlling everything. Tell me something. Have you guys ever played using your team's name? No! You've always used fake names to play the game. Well, Mr. Sharma, this is a prestigious tournament. - Yes. - And we can't lose this opportunity. - But... - Hear me out first! This is your chance to do a good deed. So, don't think. I promise you these naive kids will bless you. Think about it. Look... look, Proxy. Let's do one thing. If you can register your team - then, I will help you. - Consider it done. - Is it done? - Done! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Will you get it done? - Yes. - Then, leave. I said leave. - Okay. - Mr. Sharma, your phone. - Okay. - Thank you. - You... Parth, how are you? Come down to the ground, let's meet. Come on. Come soon. - Come on. - Pass the ball! Pass, pass. Pass ahead. How can Vikram do such a thing? What's done is done. No need to worry. I am with you, okay? Let me tell you something. Every player here has had some tragedy in his life. So, we thought that if life's mocking us then why waste time crying? Let's just smile. In fact, laugh out loud. Wait. I'll introduce you to everyone. Proxy, gather everyone around. Just watch. Slow down. Slow down. Come on. Here comes the team. This is our team. - He's our captain, Mr. Proxy. - Hello. His father was a drunkard. He made him sit at the signal, with a bowl in his hand. To make him beg. He could've begged for the rest of his life. But he wanted to fight. So, he joined our team. Now, he plays with honor. And yes, he's a bit hot-headed. So, be careful. What are you saying? Where's he? He is Chuza. He likes to study. I wonder why! He just wants to study. Whatever money he earns from playing street football he uses that to pay his fee. - Did you pay your last month's fee? - Yes. Now, let me introduce you to them. That's Nut, Bolt and Avadh. They cannot speak or hear like you and me. People would say that these poor boys can't hear or speak. What will they do in life? We say they can't hear or speak, but they can still play. They can fight. Right, boys? Yes, of course! All of them... are orphans. They call me "Jugadu." Because I can do anything with a snap of a finger. Done. And yes, we do fight. Although, we lie about it, we fight for the truth. - Right, boys? - Yes! Chandan, this time you must let the boys play, but using their own name, and not a fake name. Okay. I'll get that done. Come on, Proxy, Lukram. Go, play. - Come on. - Come on, let's go play. - Listen... - Yes? - How about a beer? - Sorry? Do you drink? Such a shame! Take him away. Come on. - I wanted to speak with you. - Yes, sir? You know that we're used to getting a top rank. But this time, our defense is pretty weak, and we might have to quit this habit. What's the update on training? Well, we're working on possession. The boys have been practicing since morning. They are lazy. As long as you're here, SRMU will never have to see defeat. Sir, I wanted to inform you that I won't be able to attend the practice for a couple of days. Why? What happened? Mom was hospitalized yesterday. Then, you must leave. Fine, you can go. Call me if you need any help. Open the door, I have to go. - How's everything? - Great. What's he doing? He's been in there for hours. Are you sleeping? Open up. Come on, open up! What's he doing in there? Aren't you Lukram's friend? Are you sleeping? Open the door or I'll break it down. Can I say something? He should've been on the team. He's a strange guy. He went home just because he wasn't selected. Without a word. Surprising! Isn't that strange? Why? Are you surprised that he went home? You had planned to send him to the hospital, right? Hold on. What do you mean? Stop trying to be naive. I know the truth. What truth, brother? That night, you guys made a plan with Ranjeet and Saurav. Lukram and I know all about it. What plan? Tell me! I know why he isn't in this college. But I will definitely ask the authorities why he isn't on this team. Where is Lukram? Why are you asking me? Who were Ranjeet and Saurav talking about that night? About Lukram, right? Speak up. - Listen... - Why did you do it? And what for? - I did the right thing. - Oh, did you? You think you did the right thing? I had to do it! He was a right-wing player, right? Then, he should've stuck to the right wing! Why did he have to play on the left wing? Tell me! That was my position, Ishwar! And you know how important this tournament is for us! Nonsense! How can you stoop so low for one game? He was our friend. He thought you were his... What did you gain from all this? I wonder where he is now! I should've understood that night after seeing the condition of the room that something is wrong. If anything happens to him... anything. I won't spare anyone! Got it? Whether it's Ranjeet or Saurav. Or you. Enough! Concentrate on your game. Because you're not worthy of being a friend. Mr. Sharma. I've registered my club. Now, enroll my team. Here are the papers. He's laughing. Keep your papers aside, and look at this paper. What is this? You guys are late. The teams have been finalized. Everything's ready. Nothing can be done now. Try something, Mr. Sharma. Don't you guys know? There's a two-day gap before the finals. And the sponsors want to organize an entertainment program. What can I do? Not this time. - What now, brother? - What else? Meeting with the sponsors. Sir... there's a singer. Very famous. He's got a terrific fan base in Lucknow. He is an amazing singer. He makes you want to tap your feet. He's right, sir. He's absolutely right. And the best thing is that this singer is pretty close to Mr. Mishra. We'll get a good deal. If I wanted to indulge in such activities I would never be sponsoring the football league. I would be organizing a star night. I want to promote football. Not your favorite Guddu Nasheela. - Mr. Bajwa, what are you doing here? - Hello, everyone! I called him here. - We want someone responsible. - That's true. Why don't you all understand? This is about football! So, the event should be related to it. So, how about a match? A special match... with a special team. Now, is he going to teach us about football matches? Did anyone ask you to speak? Your job is done. Now, get out. Sir, please let me speak. - I have a great idea. - I said get out! You think this is a joke? We're in a meeting. Wait. Let him speak. Yes, sir. Thank you. Sir, normally I like to twist my words, but I will get straight to the point. Sir, my name is Chandan, and I am not a peon, but a footballer. Is that a joke? Sir, here's my team. Special team. What's so special about it? See for yourself, sir. Well, sir, their existence doesn't make a difference to anyone. Like me. I was standing right here, but you didn't realize. Sir, some Bollywood singer or star doesn't need this platform. But these kids do. They will get a chance to display their talent. And if you really want to promote football then, there's nothing like it. Sir knows the best. - Mr. Bajwa! - Yes, sir? You're the senior person. What do you think about this match? I think we can do it. It can be done. These children will help you achieve your motive. I would like to meet your team. - Are they all from here? - Yes, sir. They are. But people look at them as outsiders. Thank you, sir. Hello. Hello. Tell me, Mr. Vikram. What's going on, Mr. Sharma? The tournament is around the corner and you changed the schedule. You put up some stupid Exhibition match before the finals, - for entertainment purpose. - Pass the ball. Do we look like jokers to you? It's not a joke. It's not in my control. I mean it's not in Sharma's control. The sponsor has made all the changes. He's the one investing the money. And believe me, he's doing it for the betterment of football. Mr. Sharma, there's always a break before the finals. What is it for? For the players to rest. What if one of my players gets injured before the finals? What will I do? Should I call Ronaldo? You're absolutely right, but please listen to me! You're worried about your team. You should think about those poor deaf-dumb orphans. What if something happens to them? You get stressed over such trivial issues. You're going to win the finals. You'll invite me to the party. You'll invite me to the party. He hung up. Okay, then. I've fixed many matches in life. But I've never done anything like this. And it will never happen. Everything else is taken care of. But now, we'll all need proper kits. How will we arrange for money? We've got our usual place for that. Come on, team. It's show time. Let the ball roll. Let it dance on your body. Show your skills, awaken your passion. Keep the fire burning. Win the world. The fame is yours. Don't lose or else, pay the price. Time is tough, but so are you. Don't lose hope, the situation will change. Weaklings will emerge victorious. The game of life is unpredictable. Those who are ready to fight. The fate is on their side. You just need to fight. Wake up and watch your words. Pay attention to the game. Pour your heart into it. Forget your hunger and thirst Forget the pain. Remember, the game is your God. Know your power, you are special. You are special. Let the ball roll. Let it dance on your body. Show your skills, awaken your passion. Keep the fire burning. Win the world. The fame is yours. Don't lose or else, pay the price. What is all this, Vikram? Such an extreme reaction because a player didn't get selected? Who is Lukram? What was his name, sir? I think he's one of your players. I have trained more than 150 players, sir. It's not easy to remember all the names. But this boy, whatever his name is he's not from my team. I can assure you that. Anyway, what did you want to discuss? About the same issue. What is going on in the campus, Vikram? Sir, if you want any update regarding the football field then you can definitely ask me. But I don't have the time to keep a tab on what's going on outside the field, in the campus or in the country. Our football club is the identity of this university. We're the defending champions, sir. And I am doing everything in my power to retain this title. Everything that needs to be done. And for this, you can do what needs to be done. Yes, sir. The commotion is going on outside the campus about a player. Who started all this who else is involved, or where did it start from. I don't want to know. What people say or think beyond this team doesn't matter to me. But if anyone tries to bring that protest on this field then, you'll have to face my wrath. That's my guarantee. He's not the first player in history who didn't get selected. Every year, a lot of players don't get selected. But there's no need to create such drama. Sir, he was not an ordinary player. Sorry? What? Sir... he played really well. We all know that he should've been selected for the team. But since he didn't get selected there's bound to be questions. What... what are you trying to say? Was he a better player than you? Then, you shouldn't be on this team either. What's your name? Forge it, sir. He's young blood, after all. Everyone makes mistakes I am rectifying that mistake! Everyone's talking in the mess... that you've been removed from the team. I was going to quit eventually. What do you want to prove by doing all this? I don't want to prove anything. I am doing what I think is right. And now? Where are you going? I couldn't protest in front of Mr. Vikram before. But now he's fired me from the team. I am not scared of anyone now. I don't care if I don't get to play football. But I am going to protest in front of the entire university. I will bring the media as well. But I will definitely find out why Lukram isn't here. Listen, this is useless. It won't make a difference to anyone. Why won't it make a difference? It does make a difference to me. And what do you think of me? And... what would Lukram be thinking? I am worried about him. He didn't meet me before he left nor did he call. I wonder where he is now! I know where he is. - Yes. - What? There won't be any need for this. And if your defense isn't strong, anyone can score a goal. Keep a sharp lookout. - Don't play like amateurs. - There he is. And listen, keep Nut and Bolt in your loop as well. Got it? Now, run along. - And listen... - Yes? If you kick from there, the guy will pass it on... Oh... - Hello. - Hey, pass it to me! Wait! - Ishwar wasn't aware of what happened. - What? Ishwar didn't know anything about it. In fact, the protest is catching on because of him. You have Ishwar. Dude, I am your friend. And you left without telling me! If you were angry, you should've talked to me! You could've abused me. You left Ishwar. Wow! A lot had happened in two days. I didn't have the time to think whom to trust, and whom not to trust. I am sorry, man. - You got... - Come on, buddy. We're back together. That's all I need. Mr. Vikram fired you from the team, right? - What a weird guy! - What's going on here? - I did so much for you... - Come on, tells us! Two brothers are uniting again. - It was a very emotional scene. - Them? - Yes. - Great. Mr. Baljeet called me. You did the right thing. Our doors are open for you. Join in. Come on, let's practice. - Come on. - We're there. Come on, team! Break over! - Okay, see you. - Bye, bro! Come on, boys! Hello, Mr. Sardar! Come, let's play. I'll be back. - Sorry for... - It's okay. - Listen! - Yes? Would you like a beer? Do you drink? I will if you offer me. I mean... do you have some? This guy drinks beer. He's going to spoil the kids. - Someone talk to him. - Who is it? Mr. Vikram? Pick it up. Give me the file. Parth, how is your mother now? Sir, she's much better. I see. Come back soon and join us if you can. The tournament is drawing closer, and you know Mr. Baljit. He's too efficient. We're facing problems. - Anyway, call me if you need any help. - Yes, sir. I think Mom will get discharged tomorrow. - So, I'll come back in a day or two. - Yeah, that's good. Welcome to interstate Invitation Football Championship which is being held in your city Lucknow. And I am your host Lokesh, and with me is Ishani. The first match today is going to be very interesting. The two best teams taking part in this league are... "Swami Ramswaroop Memorial University UP" and "Bahadur Group of Punjab." Please, give a huge round of applause for both the teams. Lokesh, what do you think? SRMU has maintained pressure from the beginning. Punjab's team is unable to keep the ball for too long. The ball's with Ranjit, and that's a save. Scoreboard is still at 0-0. SRMU's team is maintaining pressure on Punjab's team. Ranjit is heading ahead with the ball... and that's a goal! Punjab's team is looking more active. The ball's passed to Baljit, and that's an amazing bicycle kick by Baljeet... and that's a goal! Both teams are under pressure now. Fans seem very excited. Any team that scores a goal, can win. Ranjit's heading towards the goalpost, and another goal! I can clearly see the tackle combination of Bengal's team. And SRMU failed to break this combination. As I can see, the Bengal team looks completely dominating. And looking at the SRMU team, it seems that they grew overconfident after winning their first match. Today was a bad day for them. The Bengal team maintained pressure on them and they kept moving ahead on the pool table. Fans were excited about this match. Unfortunately, the rain washed away their expectations and this match. Exactly, Lokesh. I can see this rain washing away the expectations in their heart as well. Hyderabad is trying to maintain pressure on them, but SRMU must win this match to pave their way to the finals. - You can do it! - Keep it up! The pressure is on both the teams. And that's a goal! Absolutely, Lokesh. Hyderabad must score a goal to remain in this game, and on the pool table. Hyderabad's team is heading towards the goalpost. Both the teams are at 1-1 each. The expectations from both the teams are high. And this is a clear foul. This foul can cost Hyderabad this match because the goal is in Mohit's range. Like I said, that's a superb goal! Boys, pay attention. Tomorrow, we're playing against Punjab. This team has a strong point and a weak point. The strong point is... they use shadow marking. It means "man-to-man marking." And their defense is really strong. That's why, we will play 1-2. It means "ball passing." That's right. Nut and Bolt are experts in this. Yes. And their weak point is that. Mr. Bajwa won't let his best players play. They'll make the substitutes play... fearing an injury. They are already scared. Wetting their pants before getting on the field. Proxy, this team is in the finals. Don't take them lightly. Calm down. It's already quite hot in Lucknow. We must take a lead of 2-0 from the beginning. So that we can win the game. Don't let the ball through. Great! We must win this match at any cost. Got it? Because it's a match for them, but for us, it's an opportunity to prove ourselves. We'll win, sir. Ishwar's with you now. That's right! So, come on, Street army! On your feet! Come on, boys. Come on. Time to leave the streets, and enter the fields. Come on, let's go. As you all know, both the teams that have reached the finals, are going to play this friendly match with a very unique team. Words are not enough to praise this team, Ishani. We've heard a lot about this team. Some of the players on this team are orphans. Some of them can't speak. And many of them are facing a lot of challenges in life. This match isn't as easy as the Street Army thinks it's going to be. Because this time, they are facing the finalists. Street Army's trying their level best. They are looking much more active. And that's a stunning goal! As we all know, Punjab's team hasn't scored a single goal. I guess they will have to strive harder to score a goal. And as you can see, any little confusion can cost dearly to them. Do I play for you? Look, Ishani... Punjab's team has resorted to push and shove. If you want to vent your frustration, then take it out on the ball, not on the players. But Lokesh, I feel this is Street Army's golden chance to win the match. And that's a superb goal by Street Army! If the SRMU team is watching this match then, best of luck, team! Because your match with Street Army won't be an easy one. Here you are. I've been looking all over for you. I have this strange feeling. We won the match today, but this doesn't feel like an achievement. What's the point... even if we win tomorrow? What do you mean? I mean what will change? People will still think I am an outsider. They will still make fun of my looks and my language. People like Mr. Vikram won't put up my picture... on his wall. What will change? Look, bro. I don't know what will change. But I know that if we don't do anything then, nothing will change. Change is not in our hand. But we can fight. So, we just need to fight. Tomorrow, and after that as well. Okay? Let's go! Don't worry, Ishwar's with you. - Shoot. - Shoot. Good! Shoot. We've to see which team performs better. Yes, Lokesh. Just like the Punjab's team... SRMU team hasn't given any rest to its players. In fact, they have brought their main players on the field. Today's match is going to be very interesting. As you all know... Street Army has already proved themselves in the previous match and on the other hand, SRMU has been the champion for four consecutive years. Focus on the ball! Focus! Defend! SRMU team is looking more aggressive. And the ball comes to Lukram. Let's watch what happens. Lukram is playing well. Hats off to Street Army! Team SRMU is playing very aggressively here. The ball's passed to Ranjit. Ranjit passes the ball to Saurav. And Saurav passes the ball to Rohan! Rohan's running towards the goalpost... but will he be able to score? We're getting to witness an amazing match! Wow! Brilliant guy! Both the teams are playing brilliantly and aggressively. And we can see that... And we come to the game's halftime. Street Army seems to be under a lot of pressure. And as I can see victory seems impossible for them. Yes, the match is getting more interesting. Take the ball from him! He kicked him! A single mistake can also be lethal for SRMU. Good efforts from Street Army. But no gain. Of course, they are playing against the finalists. SRMU is moving ahead with the ball. Running ahead, and that's an amazing goal! That's a wonderful goal! Lukram's been pushed hard by Ranjit, as you can see here. Lukram and Gaurav are moving ahead with the ball, and Gaurav has a terrible fall. Hit it! Why did Lukram stop? Why didn't he strike a goal? These moments are rare in matches. Before winning or losing this is the biggest example of sportsmanship. The entire team is in a shock, and... Lukram's team doesn't look happy at all. What do you think? You did a great job? You became a hero in front of everyone? You think you set an example of sportsmanship? You argued with me for him, didn't you? Do you know what would've happened if he had been on our team? Our team would've lost because of him. Sir, there was a player injured on the field. What's wrong if he put sportsmanship first instead of winning or losing? I've dedicated 30 years of my life to this sport. There is just one consequence of what he did today. That management committee, selection committee, players everyone saw what he did on the field. Is anyone willing to stand by him? And he'll say he did the right thing. You know, 20 years ago... another player did what he did today. The selection committee didn't say, "You did a great job, son. You showed sportsmanship." Do you know what they said? They said, "You're not fit to play for India." "Go and play tip-cat on the streets." During that time, the East had Monopoly on football. The managing committee and the selection committee, both were from the East. The players were also from the East. They couldn't digest... that a UP player was playing better football than them. They needed an excuse. They needed a reason to keep that outsider outside. And that player gave them the reason just like him. Then, they got the chance to say... "You made the team lose by showing sportsmanship." Such pieces of news spread like wildfire in the world of football. That player could never play football after that. That was just one player, sir. That is one example. How can you base an entire theory on one example? There can be many reasons. Maybe, that player did something wrong I didn't do anything wrong! I had a right to be on that team! And it was snatched from me! Do you understand? It took me 20 years to establish UP's monopoly in Indian Football. It took me 20 years to gain that power. And in those 20 years. I kept these outsiders, and many more like him, outside. I did what they did to me. I took away their right. It's written on your face. You won't play football for 20 years. After 20 years, you'll be standing in my place as another Vikram Singh! Good for nothing. Coward Vikram Singh. Then you'll have the power, which I have today. And Vikram Singh could've been one. This idea in our country of an insider and an outsider will never let you become... Bhaichung Bhutia, Messi or Ronaldo. You'll be on my team for the finals. I know you lied to me, and now you want to apologize. If you really want to apologize then, go apologize to your mother. What you did to me was the right thing. So, finally the moment has arrived. Now, we will see who deserves this winning trophy. You're absolutely right, Ishani. After so many twists and turns this match is definitely going to be exciting.
