Mourning dove. Howdy. Howdy. Ma'am, we was wondering if you might be willing to move your trailer, so as we might be able to dig under it. - I'm camping here. - Fair point. Ma'am, might you be willing to lodge at one of the other sites around the lake so as we might be able to dig under this one? Dig for what? Well, ma'am, we buried our pops out back here a few years back on account of it's got a real nice view. But now they built that and the view ain't so nice no more. - So we figured we ought to move him. - Fair point. Thing is, someone's expecting to find me at this one. Campsite seven? Might you be able to hazard a guess as how long you might be bunking here? Ain't that the truth? We'll see you, then. - Ma'am. - Ma'am. Ma'am. Andromeda. Coma... Berenices. Cassiopea the Queen. Mourning dove. Morning. Morning. Campsite seven. Campsite eight. Campsite three. Campsite 19. Campsite 23. Shepherd on the hill. Maybe tomorrow, ma'am. - Coffee? - That'd be fine. Tallest in the state. Well... Ma'am. I'll see ya. - Howdy. - Howdy. Afternoon. Thanks. Well, go ahead. Open it. - It's a dinner invitation. - Shh. Go on. So what do you say? Got plans? Maybe, I'm... We're over there. Campsite two. Um... What can I bring? She brought me out here to propose. It's legal now, you know, like pot. It's true. You say yes? She ain't asked yet. Can't find the courage. It's true, it's all true. She was supposed to propose in South Dakota. The Badlands. I was. Beautiful place, really. Lovely. This trip was supposed to be a long weekend. But she chickened out in South Dakota. So we just kept driving. It's been four and a half weeks now? That's true. Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming. Beautiful there. - Yellowstone? - Oh, honey, it was so beautiful. Aww. I give thanks for every mile. But she still ain't proposed. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. I haven't been to Yellowstone in like 20 years. Used to fly bush planes up there. Forest Service work. Marriage, you know? What do you think I should do? I don't know. So, just getting away from things, Faye, or what? Kinda, I guess. You guess? Well, I'm meeting someone here. - Supposed to be. - Ooh! And who is this someone? I don't know, really. Hmm, so true. That's always how it is. I mean, I knew him as a kid. We grew up pretty close to here. But it's been enough decades to stand on. When is he coming? I don't know, really. Not even sure what he looks like anymore. But he says he has a small silver car and a big black dog. And I told him I'd be at campsite seven. Seeing as it's lucky and all. Well... To love. American kestrel. Mm, terrible bird. Nope. Nope. I'm going home. It's all yours. It ain't that, ma'am. We've got car trouble. It's not gonna work. Blew a rod clean through the block. Gonna need a new engine. Well... I guess you can borrow mine. Ma'am? We'd like you to have our canoe. It'll do you good for recreation and romantic excursions. All right. Howdy. Howdy. You know me? I don't know. You know me? I don't know. - That's Huck. - She looks... Just like Maggie, I know. Um... Same blood. Just a few generations down the line. Hi there, Huck. Look at you. Look at you! Look at us. Uh. Uh. Golden Aster. Thanks. Kinda got wilted in the car. My dad spent summers up there with the sheep. That's when we'd see him. Cold parts of the year they'd graze down in Utah somewhere. He was one of the last Basque Shepherds, probably. - 'Round here at least. - Hmm. They used to drive the sheep down Main Street, you remember that? I remember that. We came here for a field trip. 1970. Tenth grade. Rained the whole time. Betty Bauman brought a toad home in her backpack. Oh, God. I remember. You tried to kiss me that day. You tried to kiss me. I don't remember that. - I do. - Don't remember that. I remember catching crawdads that trip. With, uh, bacon on a string. Me too. The water used to go all the way up there. Used to rain a lot more. Tenth grade. We won the tug of war that year. Fourth of July. Carol Brothers and Big Bessie Dee. I remember. - Guess it's a tourist town now. - Hmm. I guess. Hey. Ah! There we go. Here we go. Take it on home. Oh, jeez, wait. Oh. Ah. Ugh. Well... You know, Shirley was the real musician. Me, I just never, uh... never could feel it like she did. That was... That was what she did. Tommy had a band. They used to play on Sundays sometimes. "Church tunes for doomed souls" they called 'em. He was a good man. Yeah. - Now? - Go on. - Now? - Yeah! - Now? - Now! Come on. It's good. You think the cabin I was a kid in is still there? Hmm. Think they still graze sheep round here? What? Ah, just some good memories. I don't know. Reckon you can still love something... that ain't there no more? I know you can. Don't you? I can't tell. Can I take a photo of you? Come on. I'd like to. No one's taken my photo for seven years. Y'all get to remember me real young and pretty. I think you're pretty. I do. Tell me what to do. Uh, look back toward the water. Come on, come on, that's it, that's it! - Okay? - Okay. Now slowly toward me. All right. How is it? It's really nice. - Wanna see? - No, I don't wanna see. You still play? Play what? Music. 'Course not. Starts out in G. And moves to a C. Uh-oh. I gotta cheat that one. - Back to the G. - G. Good. And up to a D. - Yeah, that's it. - D. - Back to the C. - C. Take it on home to G. Yeah. And it moves like, uh... Now. To a D. Gosh. Something like that. Campsite seven? Campsite seven! Well? What does it say? That you're coming. Oh, gosh. Can I give you a hand? Ah. Yeah, it's been a while since, uh... Yep. So... Where do you suppose I should, uh...? Uh, leeward side of the trailer, keep you out of the wind. Right, right. Uh, and, uh... Which side is that? Follow me, over here. Yeah. Door facing the mountain, I guess. Heh. Right. Okay. Good. This way, I guess. You know, Shirley, she was the real camper, I... That was what she did. Well... Eh, so long as there's no wind, rain, heat, or cold, this should do me pretty good. Come inside. Can I offer you a beer? Sure, yeah. Give that dial a swirl. Always plays the perfect song, even if in the moment you ain't sure why. Hmm? Ice cream. I've been trying... to do this alone for seven years. Mm-hmm. - I still ain't figured out how. It's a job for two. My grandma... ate an ice cream cone and watched a cowboy movie every night. - Lived to 101. - Hmm. Little Lito, she used to call me. Little Lito! I remember. What do you do, Faye? Well... There's days and there's nights. And I've got a book for each. When I heard about Tommy, I wondered if I should, you know... call... go to the service. But it had been so long. I haven't seen most of those people in more than... forty years. Taught myself to hate that place so good. And then, seven years after that, you wrote me a letter. Why'd you do that? Those first two years were, uh... you know... hard. Was too lonely to speak. I didn't talk to no one. Lost most of my teeth. I hadn't known love before, you know? And when it came, it was... just so simple. I realized what all the songs were about, you know? So when he died... I guess I forgot just as easy. But I found a way to live. Still finding it, I guess. This is my first trip without him. Less than a day's drive. We were good friends, weren't we, huh? All those years ago. Yeah. I think we were. You still miss him? Yeah. - You still miss her? - Yeah. Dwarf rabbit brush. I know, I know. Whip-poor-will. Long way from home. I put some more bait in your trap. Thanks. Uh, listen, um, I gotta thank you, for all the, you know... for getting the campsite and having me out here and stuff. Sure. I think I gotta... Um... I think I can't. Oh. It held up pretty good in the end, huh? Come on, Huck. Here we go! I've always liked dwarf rabbit brush. I remember. We're gonna be okay. Okay. - Howdy. - Howdy. Mourning dove. Oh. Coma Berenices. Cassiopeia the Queen. Andromeda, her daughter. Looks like one star, but it's actually two. Whether they know it or not. Gosh. Morning there, Faye. - Care for a cup of coffee? - Do it. You should do it. However long you get, that's long enough. Yeah? Yeah. Morning. Morning. It's today, huh? Was he a good man? Okay. Guess I'm gonna need that engine. Right in there. Watch your hands. Shall we load up the canoe? Give it to the ladies over there. It'll do them good for recreation and romantic excursions. Almost forgot. Got another one for you, ma'am. Though it don't look like you're campsite seven no more. It's a nice picture, ma'am. Thanks. Don't forget to write. Good song.
