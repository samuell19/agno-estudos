At the heart of our struggle to maintain and strengthen the Democratic way of life are the nation's schools. Schools ought to turn out good citizens. Yes, good citizens. That's right. Absolutely. This country always needs good citizens. Equal opportunity for all citizens to develop useful skills. How do you develop qualities through a regular school program? Well, suppose we take last year's class... VOICE: Hello again. It's good to see you today. There's so much to do. Are you ready to begin? STUDENTS: Yes. Good. As always, we remember, in the world is good and bad and good. And so we ask, is it good to do good things? Yes. and is it bad to do bad things? Yes. It's better when we agree on this. - Community is agreement. Again. - Community is agreement. Is it good to do good things? - Yes. Is it bad to do bad things? - Yes. Again. 4: So I'm thinking my basement is going to have this game room, right? And it's going to be like foosball, pool table. There's like this sand pit, right? And then we can put a volleyball net in the center... 27: Want some? 12: I'm good. You sure? Last day. They say dark chocolate decreases your risk of getting cancer. What are those? Crayons. Obviously. 9: The evidence is actually pretty inconclusive if dark chocolate affects your immune system. What are you reading over there? Okay, but, I really want a swimming pool. You're not getting a swimming pool. What? - Nothing. I was just thinking about inconclusive evidence. No. No, I'm going to get a pool. Just you're not- What is that supposed to mean? - Okay, you two. At least try to pretend to like each other. I don't think that's how it works. - How exactly does that benefit society? Easy. Pool parties. Everybody loves pools. Everybody loves pool parties. I'm going to get a pool. - How could you know that? You've never had a pool. It doesn't matter, alright? Everybody loves the water... Hey, can you not? - Oh my God. I can't believe it's the last day. I really hope we end up in the same Colony. - Careful. I think you're under oath. I'm serious, it's going to be great. I'll talk to you every day before you drop off my mail or pick up my trash. I don't think they deliver mail to mental wards. That's cute. What am I going to do without your sense of humor, 27? Why don't you stay over there and find out? I feel bad for whoever is getting that piece of work. You ready for this? VOICE: Good morning students. How are you all feeling today? Good. Good. Today we will not be doing our regular exercises. That is because today is your Colony assignment. Please take a brief moment to celebrate. Please stop. We will provide paradise, and in return, you will be the torch bearers. Are you ready to proceed? Yes. Excellent, please rise. You have spent countless days inside these walls learning and training for this exact moment. You, the lucky chosen. To be placed in mankind's greatest achievement yet. The Colony. A perfect Society. The only thing that remains is your final lesson. What final lesson? What is this? During your time here you've learned what is good and what is bad. This student will not be joining us at The Colony. They have acted out and betrayed our trust. They have done a bad thing. What are we supposed to do? You must punish or forgive. You are the leaders now. This is your Colony. Get rid of the bad and preserve the good. Give the command. What's the other option? - You can forgive. Spare a life by trading yours. Only six of you can go to the Colony. - What if we can't choose? You will be faced with tough decisions. Sometimes it will become unclear what is good and what is bad. You must choose and you must agree. We are on the brink of perfection. We. The Forgotten. Begin. Seems pretty clear what to do. Kill him. (STUDENTS SHOUT) Everybody calm down! We don't even know what's really going on. What happened to you? Go. Please, you need to get out. What did he say? - He said get out. Why would he say that? - Who cares? Let's just get on with it. Who put you in charge? - I just don't see the point in talking about it. Guys, I mean, come on. We're not actually doing this, right? Right? What do you want me to say? I don't know. I'm not going to let some guy that we don't even know take my spot though. There has to be another way. - Yeah there is. Someone could take his spot. Good idea. How about we put it to a vote? I pick Brenna. You really don't want to do that. - He's a student that could be any one of us. Don't get mad at me because I'm willing to make a tough call. - Yeah, by saving yourself. Super tough call. You don't speak for the room! 32. You feel like staying? No? You feel like going? No? 4. You remember what it used to be like. That was fun. 9? 27? Any takers? The room has spoken. - This is insane, guys. Come on. I mean, I don't like it. I don't agree with it, but. But what? - What else are we supposed to do? Not kill somebody who's completely innocent? - Is he innocent? Because there's a bag on his head. Maybe it's a test. Right? Maybe we're not supposed to do anything. Maybe it's a test. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Kill him, do it. - Don't shoot! (STUDENTS YELL) Guys, don't you get it? We are chosen to fix this, the people outside are animals. This is what we're supposed to do. If they're animals, then what are we? - I'm not going! I'll go. Don't shoot. I'll go. What did you do? The world is good. And bad. And good. Out there you must decide. The others chose bad. Only you chose good. You are ready. Last question Mr. Davis. Can other subjects be taught this way? They certainly can and many are.
