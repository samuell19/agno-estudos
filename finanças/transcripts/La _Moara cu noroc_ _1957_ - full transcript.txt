THE MILL OF GOOD LUCK Hey! Anybody here? - Who's there? - Shut up! Do not you hear? Open up! Hey! Open at once! Ghitza, don't open! Hey! - What do you want? - Give us something to drink and eat! I have nothing I just got here today. Don't lie to us, or you will have to deal with us. - Who are you? - Lica Samadau's men. - Who? - We are Lic Samadau's men! Take the children to bed! Hey, what kind of man is the new innkeeper? - I think he is a resonable man. - Then you will go over again. Do you hear me? You with Buza-Rupta and Saila. Now let's go to the herds. A lot can happen in life, but I wouldn't ever think, to see you and Ana, innkeppers in this wilderness,. Now, you knew it you did it. You didn't ask me. Then, all the way you told me the same thing. - Weren't there others like me who tried? - A man has to be content with his poverty. Because not the wealth but the peace of your hut makes you happy. Yes I've should stay at lneu to continnue to cobble people's boots. I was just telling you... my thoughts. From cobbler you became a innkeeper May all of this to start in a good time. And why not should have started at a good time? This placehas goodwill, and in one year we build up the money. Money doesn't profit with anything. You should be peacefull. And aren't we? Aren't we, woman? - What are you thinking of? - Nothing, Ghita. That's too much wilderness here. Especially at night when the wind blows out on the plain. The plain is full of riding people and they are not kind-hearted. What do I care? The inn is leased for three years. Then we will get out of here. You should be happy, so I can have my heart-ease. Let's go! Leave't Pintea, another time. Well, since you became innkepper, this place is blessed. - That's what they all say. - We do our best. See you. - Lica wasn't here yet? - No, but why do you ask me? Only so.. I was thinking.. - Hey! - I'm here! - Lock the gates and the stable. - I lock them right away. Ana, bring me the candle! Go to sleep, you brat! The merciful God gave you again a good day, Ghita. You remember, mother? You said to be happy with our poverty and the peacefulness of our cottage. It was better when I was a cobbler? - You're the innkepper? - Ay! Give us bread, something to eat and to drink! They are so stuck-up. - Without them, baron Vermesy is dead. Within a month the thieves will steal his entire pig herd. They are biggest bandits. Listen innkeeper... Did Samadau pass by? I don't know which Samadau you're talking about. I was asking about Lica. Lica Samadaul! I don't know. I don't know him. He's the headman of the swineherds from the plain. You don't know him, but he knows you even if he never saw you. Lica can find the pig's ear even in a pitcher of cabbage. - And you say that you haven't seen him'? - No. He didn't come by. Good luck, innkepper! Thank you! Let's go! - But they didn't pay! - Mind your own business! I've made a deal with them. - What they wanted from you? - What they wanted? Nothing... travelers like any others. They came, they left What do we care? - Who is Lica Samadaul? - I don't know, don't ask me. - Where is the innkeeper'? - We are. I know. But it also can be people around. I'm asking about the innkeeper. I want to speak with him. Ghita! Somebody is looking for you. - Are you the new innkeeper? - Yes. I came by St. George. He's Ghita, my son-in-law. Glory to the Father Since we're here we are doing well. Here are doing well all the people with brains. But, didn't some men pass by? - They are many people passing by. - I was asking about three men... Three, four, one hundred people pass. It's not the innkeeper's business to keep track of those who come and go. I'm asking about three of my men. I've sent them to see about a forest for herd. And I don't know... Did they pass by or should I wait here? It might be those three men who drank like fouls and didn't pay. It looks like the women have a better sight. - They where mine... They knew I was coming behind them to pay. But I want to talk to you. Alone. Ana The old woman should keep her mouth shut next time! - You know me? - No. I am Lica Samadau. There are much rumors about me. Some are true, some are not. As you see. I walk in broad daylight and nobody stops me. I go into town and seat and talk with the noblemen. I have 23 swine herds in my care and nobody dares to steal from me. Did you understand? I need to know who passes by. Who stays and what he says. And nobody must know but me. Otherwise it won't be good. Do we agree? - Well-doer man, Ghiga. - He is Lica Samadaul. Lica? And what things people say about him. So is the world. Do not believe anything until you see with your own eyes. And another thing People are many, They come and go... We haven't seen anything and mind of our business. Do you understand? - More dogs, Ghita? - I bought them from Arad. I make them bandogs, don't worry. This man is Martzi. I brought him to help Laie. We're going to be more now. Go and get some food. Ghita, you're here'? Open up! - What? - Pintea is looking for you. Hail, Pintea! Let me give you a cup of wine. No thanks.I'm only passing by. I wanted to see you and ask you something. - Didn't Lica pass by to see you yet? - He did... Ghiga, I do not like it here. Don't get mad at me... I'm afraid. I don't like the people that come here and this Martzi. - Dogs - It's nothing. I don't like a lot of things, but I'm tired of poverty. Two, three years We'll get through. You hear that? And then.. Laie! Where are you, you lazy one? - I'm here! - Did you lock the gates? I'll lock them right away. Health and joy from Lica Samadaul. Lica said to give us to drink and to eat. We'll give you 5 pigs which you'll choose yourself. Lica pays well. Five pigs... Ehe.. Eat and drink. I'll sort it out with Lica. How would I know how much they eat and drink? I want a clean count. - Good Day! - Good Day! - Why didn't you get them? - What should I do with them? Slaughter them, sell them, raise them. Maybe the man didn't have money. You see he's honest and pais you fairly. Take it, you do not know what will be tomorrow. It will pass other herds too. Come on, get up and eat! Come on, hurry up, hurry up! Or Lica is gone kill us. Lica said that I can take 5 pigs. We don't know anything. We either pay in advance or we don't pay at all. Perhaps they came across a mole-rat or a fox. There's no fox. Damn dogs. Perhaps there is nobody at the inn. - Leave them to me! - Smart-ass! You want them to bark at us each time we stop by? Don't you think it would be better for us to leave? - There by St. Demetrius. - Why? - Don't you got bored in this wilderness? - Some times. But I got used to it. - Aren't you scared? - Why? Why'? By everything. Do you hear how the dogs are barking? They traced something and they bark. But I got bone-like chill. Do you hear? No more barking. Good dogs but I'm their master. What's the matter with you? Why are you scared? I don't know. I'm losing today for tomorrow. Samadaul took your peace away. See? That's why you shut up. You boil everything inside you and you never tell me anything. Maybe Hey, do not hear? Call Ghiga! Tell him we're here. - Well, I will - Haven't you go yet? - Where are you going? - Wouldn't it be better if I'll go? Let him come to us. What else he has to do? Ghita, wait! Laie Go to the pirest at Fundureni and tell him that Lica and his men came to the inn. Do you hear mer? - Yes.- Laie Go through the valley, behind the willows so you won't be seen. - Hail, give God! - Hail! Let's go inside. You two stay here. - Are we alone? - There's nobody here. - We have a word togheher. - And more Take a look! These are the signs of my heards. When pigs heards pass by take a look to their ear. Keep in mind their herdman and keep your mouth shut. - I think we got a deal! - I think not. - How so? - A forced deal is not a deal. I will do it, and do what ever suits me better on your back. You either indulge me, or I'll bring somebody else here. Listen to me! Don't you think that you can keep me here by fear. Try to get along with me. This is my deal! You can think what ever you want, but you fear me! - Give me the keys! - What keys? All of them! From the chest, from the closets... Who comes here, comes to make money. You did it too. I'm going to borrow from you. I'm not stealing... I borrow and then pay up. With how much usury you want. Until it comes to terms, of course. I'm not hand writing it, it has no use for you. I live, I pay. If I die, you still can collect. - You want me to count them? - Why waisting time. There they are! Take how much you want, just leave some there so the wife doesn't see. Ready! Aren't you coming? Did you see that you became as docile as a lamb? Don't you move or I'll kill somebody. - What do you want? - Nothing. I have a wife and children and I can't do anything to you. You took my money Much good may it do you! Do not think that you can mock me! Do not play with me! You're afraid and you wouldn't be ashamed to call your men to help you. I would be ashamed if I would have come without them. - Then I'll call them to see you. - Hey people, help! He fly with us. Raut, tie-up the servant! Bring the wife and the children inside. Don't involve my wife into our business. Don't touch me because it won't be good. Don't be a stupid bandit, Lica! You can kill me with your thieves but I can bring you to gallows. Do you know where is the servant? I sent it to the priest in Fundureni to tell him you're here. That's right.. I haven't seen him since. For this is what I'll keep you in my mind as long as I will live. No hard feelings! You can't catch me. People like me are dangerous servants but inestimable friends. - Did I say that I want you to be my servant? - It's all right then... I understand that wthout your help I can't stay here. I will indulge you. But people should believe that we don't get along. - But what are we supposed to think about you? - I am as you know me. Like this... - You leave me the money. -You mean I'll take them.. What's in your hand does not lie. Bring wine! Let's dance. So you don't say that you wasn't danced. - And if I don't feel like? - You will... Leave me alone, I don't want to dance! You became so chossy. Dance women, he won't take your beauty away. Much good may it do you! You beat me. You're stronger then I am. Cursed inn... Hey Ghita, why do not you hire a waitress? Weather is changing. I'll stay here overnight. Hence and where? Well, from one misery to another. Don't you know us'? Ghita! - When does the landlord come? - The landlord? - I was thinking to go to him. - Don't go! Let him come! - I have a word with him. - Fine. - Shall I warn you when he's here? - No need. I'll find out. My care for the landlord. I have money on me and the roads are bad. Then, we'll leave. Not even dogs will bark at a poor man. Let's go. Wait! You two are going back to lneu, as we agreed. Raut has things to do Fundureni. Who's there? - What happen Ghita? - What would it be? Nothing. Raut is coming back. It wasn't Raut's voice. Go and see. Why the dogs aren't barking? What kind of people are those who walk at night? I've seen them, don't worry. If they wheren't people we know, Martzi wouldn't not let them pass. - I don't like Martzi at all. - Well, you suspect everybody. Come on, behave and calm down! Get away! What the hell is that? You can leave. What happens, Ghita? - Shut up! They are leaving. What kind of notable people were here yesterday? I don't remember. I need to find out. I don't know why you ask me but I can tell you that I'm not responding to such questions. Do not try to put my life in danger or make me tell lies! If you have something against me, tied me up and take me with you! That will be done if it will be necessary. Be a man, Ghiga! Am I not your friend? - Exactly for that. - You tell everything to Lica. - What does Lica have to do with this? - A lot. - Do you know Lica? I know him. - Well enough? - Well enough. We where once caught together. - You had been served time? - Yes. We stole some horses, Lica and I. And now you have against him? He did something to me, that I will not forget for life. I'm a 38 years old, Ghita. If I make 40 and I'm not get him I'll hang myself. But let's not waste time. - Who was here yesterday? - Don't ask me, I can not answer that! Then I'll tell you what it is about. Last night, two men with faces covered heist the landlord. They crushed him and took all his money. Lica did it! I could swear it. - What do you think that? - No way. Lica slept here last night. I can witness. Harness the horses! Take your servants and come with me at lneu! Gendarmes will stick here. - What does Pintea want? - I'm going at lneu with Laie and Martzi. We're going with Pintea. Something happened. Close the windows, do you want to strike us out of the blue? God strikes only those with bad conscience. God. Always God and only Him. - Do you have a room? - Yes, we do. Here! - Do you need something? - I wish that the rain stops, so I can go ahead. - Where are you going? - Do not know. Around. Hereabout are the forests with pig herds? As far as the eye can reach - She has herds? - So they say. - But who is she mourns? - Her late husband. - He shot himself three weeks ago. - He shot himself? What for? I do not know. You must understand that to be a mystery in the middle. Poor woman! Get us something to drink! I feel like I send everything to hell. Horses and carriage, lady and child and all. - Leave them here in wildness. - Shut up, she will hear you. - Did they give her money at the Bank? - Yes, they did,'cause her bag is full. If only God would give Samadaul an idea Or do you think Samadaul steals and she sells? I do not think, I suspect. But let it be, if I'm right... God saw us both. - Prepare the carriage! - Ma'am, I say we should stay a little longer. - The horses are weary. - We'll remain in the middle of the road. I said, prepare the carriage! Here's the money. Can't you give me another one'? This one is ragged. Here's another one! It's impossible! These servants of the innkeeper, are either stupid or paid. Each one says something different. The one from the stables, he's not to blame. The one who just get out, is smart. He knows well who came in and went out yesterday night from the inn. Yes Let the innkeeper come in. Come on! I'll tell you what! As things stand, you can only go home on bail. Even you to do something like this to me'? Okay, Pintea. Then my cousin, priest Andrei will come and bail me. You are a friend of Lica Samadaul? I wouldn't say exactly a friend. He's a man I wouldn't want as an enemy. But what do you gain if he's not your enemy? I don't gain much, but it's obvious that I might have some losses if I would have a grudge with him. His people eats and drink. That's why I became a innkepper. Look at me! With what does the Samadaul pay you'? If he doesn't have money he gives me hogs. You know how is called that one who associates with bandits? Mr. Commissary, do not throw on me such a word, 'cause you ave no reason. If you cannot clean the roads of bad people, like you think Lica is, then don't buffet those those who you leave them in distress. Shut your mouth! I'll take you down. - Lica spent all night alone? - No, a man with a woman came to him. - Who was that man? - I don't know. - Wasn't he Raut, by any chance? - No. Maybe it was another. I don't know. It was dark, I didn't see well. You talked about the landlord with Lica? Yes. I mean he asked me if I do not know when he was coming by. - Has anyone else heard? - I think not. He took me aside. Didn't Samadaul say that just so he can put the blame over you? If it will be proved that he heist the landlord? I don't think so. It can't be... All I can swear to is that Lica slept all night at the inn. We will sort this out too, just so you'll see that we can clean the roads of bandits. I'll let you free on bail. Go away! This one remains here. Come on! Dear cousin, do not get bitter. Truth, as is written in Holy Scripture, leaves like oil over water. I've told you... You shouldn't have become an innkeeper. The money, which people give for the devil's water isn't clean. - Who's this woman? - She'll be you're waitress at the inn. Waitress? I would need somebody like that, but not right now. I thought you said that you need. I've chose her myself. You're bringing a spy into my house. Don't be surprised. I have order to search your house. This too... All right, Pintea. You tell me, on your soul, you believe me or not guilty? Don't ask me that because I can't answer. These are the words I've told you this morning. You didn't get to know me until now. We suspect everyone. That's our job. Much good may it do you! If you believe me so or otherwise. Halt! Drive! This is not good. Are you ready to swear that Lica didn't do this? - Are you out of your mind? - Let's not waist time. She remains there. We three set afoot through the forest to look the trail. - Come on! - I'm not going. I'm going home. You can't go without me. Get out of my way! Don't force me to a sin, Pintea! I can't leave my folks alone in this wilderness. Get out of my way or I'll crush you! A bum like you doesn't stop me! Bum?Bum you said? Then you can go! Mr. Ghita! What happens, Ghita? - Who pass by here today? - People, of all sorts... Don't talk that way to me right now. It is true that I left and didn't tell you how things are. You know, last night they heist the landlord He was beaten to death, and stole from him money, gold and silverware. They have suspected and me. I only got loose on bail. On the way we found a boyar carriage and a slaughtered child Who else was in that carriage? - What's wrong with you'? - Don't get close to me! - Leave me alone, don't touch me! - I have to know what's wrong with you. Is danger! Good Lord, it's danger into my house. Why are you hiding from me? Why? You think me stupid, but I'm not. Last night I wanted to take my children and leave. To leave you to this wildeness and to your passion, but I didn't had the strenght. They have heist the landlord... I heard you yesterday,talking to Lica. You think I didn't see Lica coming back, returning at dawn from lneu'? What do you mean? You hooked-up with Lica robbed the landlord. So, even you... Yes, kill me because you're stronger then me! You say that I hooked-up with Lica, to rob the landlord. Yes, you! I'm sick when I think that you can share the bed and the house with a man as you think I am. - What happened? - What'up? - Not good at all. - What? - He left alone with the deads. - Why didn't you stay there? There came... there came people with covered face. I've seen they came on horses to kill me. - Do you have two horses? - I have. We're going to the corporal. That's Pintea. Pintea hey! Where are you? You stay on guard here! Water! After me! Where are you? Silvers, knife Yes. You can make a connection. No doubt the Saila and Lip-torn are those who heist the landlord. And killed Hanti. The whip... yes. Lica is not the man to leave behind something at the crime scene. And then others can have whip like this. I report, Lica Samadaul in here, in lneu. He came to wait on a lady from Arad for a hogs sale.. Arrest him! I'll go. I dutiffuly report that we couldn't search at the inn. - The innkeeper ran away. Bring him cuffed at once! I heard you found a carriage and a child dead on the roadside. I hope you don't think to put this, too my account. I don't know. You Pintea... If I where you I would convict you even if you where innocent. You will not roil me. I'm not the man that you can twist as you like. If I want to, I already did it. But leave me alone Stop pestering me! Don't you see that I'm going without any opposition? See that I made you nervous? Laugh if you can. Because tonight I'll laugh when I'll walk with a cigarette in mouth among these people. Be careful is loaded. Don't fool around! Lads, anyone of you go at Baron Vermesy mansion house to tell him that around 70 hogs had vanish from the herd and that I was arrested and can't look after them. Do you see them? Lica Samadau. I swear to tell the truth and only truth. So help me God. What have you talked with the innkeeper from "The Mill of good fortune" about the landlord'? I didn't talk anything about the about the landlord at the inn. - What about the maid? - I don't remember. In the testimony is stated that Saila and Lip Torn left to lneu without... It may be, but I don't remember. Who was the woman, that Raut brought to the inn? Raut came to tell me that a herd had vanish. The innkeeper and his servant must be mistaking that they saw a woman. Don't you suspect that the innkeeper from the "Mill" was hooked-up with Saila and Lip torn? I do not think they had heist the landlord. Nor that they have committed the crimes on the country road. Do you know that the silverware was found at Lip Torn's house? I know. I think it was hidden there by somebody. Maybe by one of Pintea's men who is my enemy. - Do you know these? - I can't answer anything. I wait for things to unravel from the others testimony. Witness Raut! That night I went with Samadau to the herds. One got lost. We searched for it all night, but we didn't found it. We went in the Fundureni woods, and Sicula too... Maybe Saila and Lip torn has stole it. I was in lneu that day when... these two say that they came there, but... Mr. Biro Zsolt knows...I didn't seen them, in vain they say that. They are lying! I was in Fundureni forest, and I didn't see them. And I was to Sicula and I didn't see them either. I was at home in lneu that night and I didn't see anything. And my wife didn't see anything too. I was asked. Well, this is what I know. Corporal Pintea! We can't accept this testimony. Corporal Pintea is an enemy to our client. He threatened to kill him. We have witnesses. I accept. I think that Saila and Buza-Hupta are not guilty. That the silverware was hidden at his house by someone else. Rau; couldn't come at the "Mill" except with a fellow. He couldn't get a woman at night because the inn is far and they wouldn't go. How did you walk from lneu to Salonta and nobody saw you? Why were you hiding? We didn't hide, but we didn't met with anyone. I don't really understand. Raut went to Fundureni, and not to lneu. Why is that? So we had agreed. To avoid that Lica Samadaul, who's our enemy would have been angry with Raut. That is why he went to Fundureni so we could meet up on the hill.. His lying, Monday I was at the Mill and Tuesday on Sicula forest. This one is lying to entrap me. I have four witnesses. We have agreed with Raut; to steal a herd from Fundureni and we went secretly at Salonta to look for a buyer. Honoured Tribunal, the accused's words are contradicted by the facts. These ones here are the true responsibles. They are enemies of Lica Samadaul. Same as Pintea, here present. It is clear that they could not commit the crimes in agreement with him. Only they have purposely left Lica's whip near his beloved landlady body. although he defended them with chivalry. Lica couldn't be one of the robbers, because he slept at the Mill We summon the innkeeper as witness. The truth is in your hands. Do you swear that night Lica stood all the time at "Moara cu noroc"? I can't swear he didn't left, but I swear that I thought he was at the inn all night. On the name of His Majesty the Emperor Franz Joseph the First, we decide: Defendants Saila Boarul and Buza-Rupta are sentenced to life for robbery and murder. No, I am not guilty! Lica Samadaul is find innocent. Innkepper Ghita is aquited for lack of evidence. Forgive me, Ana! You forgive me, at least! I won't forgive myself as long as I live. I haven't sinned anything, but I didn't want to believe you when you showed me the right way. Whose are these? The landlord or the damsel? From both of them. I borrowed from you as a thief, as a thief I pay you back. - What if somebody catch me with this? - Money is money, and you're a innkepper. You take what anybody gives you. - And if I turn you in? - I'm not afraid of that. You didn't do it at the trial, now it's late. See? You are a wise man. How would benefit you if you have told the judge what even him wouldn't want you to say'? You Ghiga... Nobody can get over my brain. Neither you, nor others. And those who wanted to mischief me, let them sit in jail if they are stupid. What about the woman in the carriage'? I had with her what I have with you. She was selling gold and gems for me. But she was about to cough me up. And she befool me. And for that you extinguish four souls? You're not human, you're evil. You understand now? The one who is with me doesn't have to fear anything, the one who wants to harm me tremble like an aspen leaf. You where an honest man, and I made a guilty man out of you. If I want I can take you to be hanged. - But what for? - Don't worry! It doesn't suit me now. I need a man like you. Tomorrow I'm leaving. Leave me alone! Wait! Now I won't let you leave. Until now you stayed out of greed, from now on you will stay out of fear. - What do you want with me? - What do I want? Many travellers perished in this inn, and have been found far away from here. Since you're here nobody died yet. Do you understand me? And no one will die as long as a I stand here. Except me, maybe. You're talking like a fool. Maybe I talked like that once. I don't remember. When I killed the first man, I needed some money to pay the baron some hogs that perish from his herds. The second one I killed... Uh, what do you know... Now I don't care. You are a human, Ghiga, you pile up too much hate inside you. If you were my mate, I'll laugh even at the Devil's mother. - I am your mate. - I won't accept you. You can manage somebdoy only with his sins or weaknesses. Only then you can be his master. But there is a weakness that I fear. People with these weaknesses will turn you in when you won't expect. It happpened once with Pintea, I don't want it to happen with you. - What kind of weakness? - Women. Worse. The weakness for one woman. - A good week, Ghita! - A good one... - Is that paper good? - God give me only these ones! Ann! What happened? Why did you get up? - Where do you have this money from? - How should I know? From travellers... Ghiga, do not play with the devil! You received all this money from one man. They are all marked up, and this one was in my hand before. I saw it before at that woman who had been murdered. Either you're mixed up in this things or you don't know how to beware of bad people. - Ghita, who gave you the money? - Travellers, how do I know Put the horses to the carriage. I'm taking my children and I'm leaving. Those kids are mine too. Yes, they are marked. I got them from a man who you don't know. But you will some day. Don't get worried if you'll see me changed. I must bring to an end a hard matter. I'm leaving right now so I can be back tomorrow morning. Don't let anyone to know that I was gone!Go to bed. - Where are you going? - You'll see. You need to have testimony that you got money from him. But Lica will handed them to you only in private. Then what do we do? A lot could be done if you were more cunning. Do you know that your servant Martzi is one of Lica's men? - Martzi? - Wait, don't get all heated up! I found a "cure" for Martzi. Now, listen! The pricked money from the bank. There they are put on wire and sealed. They are the Damsel's money. Gold and silver are from the landlord. He also had some of those big banknotes which he had marked with a cross in a corner. Are you able to yield Lica to me when he has this sort of maney on his strap? - I'll do it. - Take it easy! Lica will ask you to exchange the money. Maybe even to sell gold and silverware. You come to me and I ask the landlord to exchange them. - Don't get into trouble. - That is my concern. May God help us catch him. So the law will govern. - It will turn out, Okay. - Might be otherwise? When a wife so beautiful holds the other end. Not long to finish. I'll make the handle on my own. Climb the hill until you see Fundureni church steeple. And then straight ahead. Safe trip! - Thanks! - God bless you! Ghita, I want to talk to you. Half are yours. Be careful when you change them, they are marked. As it were you make me an accomplice. But if I take them to court and I told that I have them from you? If you were going to do that you wouldn't told me. Then I you know that you are a man who cares about money. There you are! You'll get half of these too. Change them and the guys. Go to Arad tomorrow! And from now on we're sharing. So to know! Man, he stole a lot from the landlord. - A lot. - And all this money belong to Lica? All, who the hell they would be, aren't mine. Listen! When will you let me know that Lica's coming'? To catch him with the money on him, like we talked about. How should I know when he comes? Always comes unexpectedly. Sometimes money, sometimes without. That's not life. Sometimes I would run as far as I can. Okay... Heaven forbid you to try to befool me! Wait! Why did you get angry? No, I didn't got angry. You have the right to speak to me as you like. - What do I care? - Come on, don't be upset! I forgot too, when you called me a bum. Come, let all this to pass so the justice can be sewed. Man, we have other people. I told you I'll kill myself if I don't catch Lica. - But what did he do to you? - He took my woman. On Easter I'll send my family to lneu to relatives. Then we will get him. If there is the last thing I'll do. Listen, Ana, I can't go with you. xxx I have to wait for Lica. Ghiga, if you stay, then I'm not going either. Are you insane? You'll go without me! I'll come the next day. I won't celebrate Easter without you. What would people say? God damn the people! I want you to go. Do not you hear? Why do you shout at me? Why? - Tell me, what load you have on your mind'? - You stand in my way. It's okay. That is why I'm staying. Don't you think you can cast me away. I care about you and I will care about you, no matter how bad you should treat me. A lot you care about me! Honestly, you know that Lica is coming here. That is why you want to stay. You became such a scoundrel if you can say something like that. You bow before him like a servant, not me. God forbid, we have something on your mind because then our life will be worse than slavery. And I'm not leaving you alone. Mother, go alone with the children! Ghita is waiting for Lica and I'm staying with him. My dears... dears I've kept quiet until now... but I can't do it anymore. My heart is heavy as a boulder. You leave your kins for somebody like Lica, on Easter? I kept quiet, but I can't anymore. Lica is a wicked man. Keep him away from you! Mama, come with us! Mama! Listen! Why did she stay here? - I couldn't let her go. - You couldn't. You should have. I don't come and go as you like. I got gold, silverware, money. - Make her go away. - How do I do it? It's your problem. What do I care? Tell her to go away! God forbid you from people which have a weakness for a woman.. - I don't have any weakenss. - Yeah... You have! Now I'll put an end to this. Good thing that she stayed there. I have an itch in me, a big one. Terrible itch! I'll bet that now we'll see musicians here. I'm in tune! I would party too. I'll turn Ghita to go away so he will leave us alone. Only if you can. You are wrong if you think that my man cares so little about me. Look how upset she get. I've reached your heart. If I didn't know Ghita's love for you, I would have snatch you a long time ago. - Come let's dance. - I don't want to dance. You've told me that before. Come! Sing it louder! Now leave me alone! Ghiga will be upset. I don't want otherwise. Let's bothered him a bit. Don't you give her to me once, on Easter day? Do what you want with her. Go around and leave me here alone with her. I'll say that you went to sleep in the barn attic. It will be hard the first time After that you will be forever healed. - When do I come back? - Tomorrow morning. I'm asking you just this. Don't disgrace me to other people. Of course. Raut! Put the horses to Ghita's waggon and go to the wedding in Sicula. Tonight you and Paun come back and stay hidden. Get out only at my signal. You know which... - I know, an oink. - Right, now go! Who comes with me at Sicula? It's a wedding there. We take fiddlers and drink until we'll see the moon... Come on ! Jump up! - But where is Ghita? - He went too. I told you I'll make him go away and leave us alone? He's here! I'm telling you he is here! We'll wait until it get dark. Get the horses out! - Is this what you think now? - You feel this kind of things. If I would love you it would be harder to leave you. The people thinks I'm evil because I know how to contain myself. I wont lose my head now either. What? What are you going to do? I am going- You can't go and leave me alone like this. I have to go and I don't want to stay. If you go, then take me with you! I can't, I don't want to see him again. What do I do with you? You are a strong man, Ghita. I hate Samadau like I never hated a man in my life but... I could never use my wife as bate. What are you waiting for? You said that you're leaving. He's leaving! He's leaving! On your horses! After him! To the right. Quickly! Go! I'm going back home to finish my issues. The strap. The strap. My strap! One by one, one after another, a man after another man, all those who can sell me out life with life to be payed, because if don't kill them, they will kill me. Hey Ghita! Don't you give her to me once, on Easter day? I do not want to die. Do not kill me! Do not be afraid! You know that I think the world of you. I will not make you suffer. It won't hurt you. Do not kill me. What have I sinned? What do I know? Like a bastard I've pushed you into his arms. Now I see that I did wrong. If I would have found him here I wouldn't have killed you. - Where did you go? - After Pintea. To catch Lica with the money stolen from the landlord. From him I received the marked money and the broken one. Why didn't you tell me that? Because I wasn't blessed by God with that thought. Make a cross Make a cross, there is no time! Help he's going to kill me! Help... Shoot! It's you? Lift me up... Look inside for the money, then burn it down! Will meet at Ineu.
