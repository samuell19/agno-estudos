Ernst Lubitch's CARMEN was first screened in 1918. In 1921, the original negative... ...was heavily altered for the American version of the film, Gypsy Blood. All surviving elements originate from the same camera negative, which is now lost. Only fragments of the German distribution version are preserved on nitrate film... ...in the Deutsche Kinemathek. A censorship card is not available. The basis for the digital restoration of the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation... ...in 2018 was an incomplete black-and-white archive duplicate... ...from the former holdings of the State Film Archive of the GDR. Another shortened black-and-white duplicate of Western production from the 1970s... ...with German intertitles served as a supplement for changed or missing shots. Both materials are now stored in the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv. For the 4k digitisation at L'Immagine Ritrovala, the materials from the... ...holdings of the Deutsche Kinemathek and the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv were used... ...and combined to create a largely complete version. The total of 45 missing titles were reconstructed on the basis of the... ...flash titles contained in the archive duplicate or,... ...if there was no graphic template, digitally reproduced on the basis... ...of handwritten notes in a similar font and marked with FWMS. The nitrate film fragments served as the basis for the black and white materials. These also served as the basis for the colour plan,... ...which, however, remains largely speculative.
