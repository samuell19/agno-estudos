I thought you were supposed to be at boot camp. You know, I was gonna shoot your ass. I ought to rearrange your face. That's what I should do. What the fuck is with that durag on your head anyway? [window closes] [Hector] I don't know what the hell you are doing at my crib. But I want this shit... out of my room. [Raymond] What you mean shit? What shit? This shit. It's fucking garbage. Hey, this isn't garbage. This is something that you don't get to see in the infantry, my man. People are sick of it. Have you been busted for this yet? Never, never. You mean to tell me that I'm busting my ass, I'm sending money home for you and Mom... and you're sitting at home, doing this shit? Maybe you should be honored a medal for this. Stop fucking around and be a man. There ain't nothin' out here for you. Oh, yes, there is. This.

Hey, I just wanted to find out if they needed any help in the store or anything, you know. Let me tell you, Connie don't have no jobs but this one. And I don't think you're man enough to take it from me. If you really needed a job, you would've came here last week when all them graffiti guys got together and painted this mural. They got some green off of that. Yo, I don't hang out with those guys. Man, I ain't got nothing to do with those dudes. And then I saw your female with them, too. [Chico] What's up with her? I've been hearing that she's been giving that stuff out to all them graffiti guys. Yo, shut the fuck up, Chico, man. I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass.

Nice to meet you, man. All right, I'll check you out, man, you're cool. [Raymond] All right. [Z-Roc] Yo, man. Wait up, I just wanna talk to you, man. I wanna talk to you about the Union. [Raymond] What about the Union? I don't wanna talk about those guys. [Z-Roc] These guys are making a lot of money, man. I think you should be down with this. [Z-Roc] The guy who paid them is only around at night, when the place opens up. This big black dude, uh, I think his name is Phade. [Raymond] Oh, shit! Phade? I know that guy. [Z-Roc] Yo, this is only the beginning of what the Union guys are gonna do for money. 'Cause when this article comes out-- -[Raymond] What article? -[Z-Roc] Yo, this lady reporter, her name is Virginia. She's coming to interview them tomorrow, at the Dixie Mural. [Raymond] If she's doing something on the Union, then obviously, she's gonna do, like, their pictures, and they don't even got whole cars rollin'. They don't even know what whole car is. [Z-Roc] The lady said that some museum might be interested in their work. [Raymond] What work? [Z-Roc] They're doing graffiti, on canvas. [Raymond] So now they're making graffiti on canvas? Graffiti ain't canvases. Graffiti's on the trains and on the walls. And they ain't got nothing to talk about. Ah! I like that. Completely brand-new. [Raymond] And being a graffiti writer is taking the chances and shit. Taking the risks. Taking, like, all the arguments from the transit, from the police, from your own mom, you know. From your friends and shit. You know, you gotta take all that bullshit. "Ah, you're vandalizing on the street." [Raymond] I remember when Butch and Kase were really bombing with nice whole cars. And Pnut and Tracy was king of the D's. And Caine 1 was really whole-carring on the damn 7 line. [Z-Roc] Oh, shit. That looks brand-new with the windows and all. That's the newest stuff I've seen. How can you call people that hang out in windows and watch trains riders, man? You gotta write. You gotta do the action, man, you know? You gotta go out there, rack up! You gotta go out and paint. [Raymond] And be called an outlaw at the same time.

It was hard. -I was scared. -At an impressionable age. -[Crash] You know what I mean. -[Caz] But I got over it. You just, pick it up. It's like a virus. These guys came into the scene, and I just started hanging out with them. Got to love graffiti. The trains. She got on the jock. Aren't you scared to be a girl and do it? [Virginia] How long did it take you to paint this wall? [Daze] Uh, we just came, like, in the morning. It took us, like, about four hours to paint it. [Rose] And we got quite a few jobs lined up.

I don't think he's totally, like, straightforward with you, you know what I'm saying? What are you talking about? He's a great guy, man. He's an old writer.

I'm sorta the manager, you know. I'm Joe Lewis, man. -Joe Lewis? Nice to meet you. -Yeah. Lower East Side. -Yeah, you from Downtown? -Yeah. -I got some people round there. -Oh, yeah? What's up? What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to you about some business here. -Business here? -Yeah. Listen, um, just... Wait out in the car, I'll be out in a minute. All right? All right, I should be right out. So, what's up, Joe Lewis? Um... I got this project going down, you know, we're gonna throw this jam, this weekend. -Hmm. -[Joey] Right? Now, you know the band show in the park, on Avenue A and Seventh Street? You mean, off the Lower East Side? That big thing by the river. -Uh-huh. Yeah. -It's like a big dome. -I've seen that. -You know. -Right. -Mm-hmm. Well, we wanted to get that thing painted, 'cause we got ourselves a jam there. -Mm-hmm. -See? The baddest graffiti guys would be hangin' out here. We got all the rap musicians. [Phade] Cold Crush Brothers, Fantastic Five, Busy Bee, Little Rodney Cee. -Yeah, that's good. -Why not, man? I can rap to the people that ask me, man. I think, I'm thinkin' it can happen. -Is that cool? -I think it can happen. -Okay. -[laughs] [man 1] Uh, excuse me over there. -Do one of y'all have the time? -[Raymond] Nah. [man] It's a chilly night out here, ain't it? -Yeah, really. -Yeah. So, what y'all up to? -Oh, nothing. -Exactly. They look good don't they, fellas? Yeah, I'm serious. It's this lady here. [man 1] Smoke? [clicks tongue] [Virginia] Um, yeah, like... [inhales deeply] Well, uh, I think I got, um, had enough. -[man] Really? -[chuckles] How 'bout sniffin'? You sniff? [Virginia] Well, not right now, I don't think. [inhales deeply] [Virginia] We gotta get in the car. -Why is that? -[car engine revs] [Virginia] Well, we're, we're sort of busy. We have another party we have to go to. [man 1] It's like that then, huh? Look, peep, you heard it on the radio, you seen it on a TV show. A to the K. A to the motherfuckin' Z. Hey, hey! What's up? What's up! [Phade clicks tongue] Hey, man. These people cool, man. Yo, what's up, Phade? These your friends? This is Virginia. She's a reporter, man. [Phade] They all right. They cool, homey. This my man, Ray, here. Ain't no need for this. Yo, man. I'm sorry, man. I had no idea they was your friends. [Phade] It's all right, man. Don't worry about it, you know. [man 1] I'm sorry about that, Phade. [Phade] You know how that goes. [Virginia] Prepare to meet some very important people there. And they're dyin' to meet you. You're gonna be the hottest thing at this party. [Raymond] I just can't believe that these people are just getting so interested in graffiti all of a sudden. [Virginia] Listen, these people are ready for new thrills. [Phade] There's gonna be some influential people there, man. [Virginia] Just trust me, Raymond. I'm gonna make you into a millionaire. [upbeat music] [Virginia] Wait until I tell everybody at the party how we almost got killed! They'll love it. I had no idea what these people were talking about. It was out of the blue. And I'm sure you would have felt the same way if you'd been unlucky enough-- [Phade] Hey, how you doin'? Excuse me for interruptin'. I'm Phade. I came down with Virginia. -Hi. -The journalist. -You must be-- -Hi, I'm Niva. -You're Niva? -Right. Your place is really incredible. I mean, you got, like, all this cool, modern art in here. -[Niva] Mm-hmm. -It's crazy. Hey, what do you do? Hm. I'm in the art business. I run that little museum down the street. What's, what's the name of it? -The Whitley. -Really? Can I call you Zoro? No, no. It'll be better off if you just call me Raymond. Raymond, you can't paint them in the subway stations. Well, graffiti has its own spots. You need special places? Like, at night, you have to sneak in? You can say that. Well, if you work in the dark, how can you see what you're painting? Well, I can't see what I'm painting, but I do know what I'm drawing. And I know my colors by heart already. You ever get chased? -Caught? -Yeah. I've gotten chased so many times, but the knuckleheads never got to catch me, you know. But you should see his work, because-- I've probably seen it. We spent 50,000 dollars last year, removing graffiti from the side of our... building. Bro, I'm sure Zoro's work wasn't on the facade of your building, but you should check out his painting, man. -I think I remember seeing a Z. -It's really strong stuff. You know? Rap music? [Raymond] Yeah, like, you know, the MCs, they get up on the mic. And they like, shout at everybody, you know, "Everybody say, 'Ho!'". "Say, ho!" I'll give you my card. I'll... Wait, wait. Zoro's over there. Let me go rap to him for a minute. I'm leaving tonight, I'm going to Europe. I'll be away for six straight months, but when I get back, you bring him to see me and I'll remember your face. I never forget a face. -All right? -[Phade] Okay. Nice to meet you, Flange. [chuckles] He was just telling me about the rap convention they're having at Delancey school. Yeah, the rap convention. You should come down, it's gonna be wild. I'd love to. I was thinking of bringing some cameras down. I'm doing a... -Cameras? Really? -...TV special. Oh. TV special. -Yeah, I'm on TV. -Oh, really? [Virginia] There's someone you should definitely talk to. He came down with me and Ray. -Yeah, we met earlier. -Yeah, we met earlier. How you doing? I was just talking to Raymond here about... -About the convention. -...possibly doing -a TV special. -Yeah. It's gonna be really sick. By the way, Raymond, um, Niva, the host of the party, wants to talk to you. She's right over there. [Raymond] Okay. Yeah, it's really... I think this is really gonna be a big one. He's an incredible graffiti artist. Yeah, he's like, he's really good. I'm pretty good, too. I'm Niva, nice meeting you. -Nice to meet you. -So, this is Neil. Zoro, Neil. -How you doing? -Pleased to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. -Oh, you have? -Yeah. Uh, Neil, would you do me a favor, -and get me another drink? -Certainly, darling. Zoro, can I get you something from the bar? Um, red wine would be okay. -You got it. -Okay. Thank you. Well. How you doin'? Okay. I'm very happy you're here. You got a fantastic view over here. [Raymond] You know, I only see this in comic books. And now I'm standing here, watching the whole world at my feet. I feel like God almost. I would love to make a painting of this. [Niva] Well, that's exciting. -Are you serious about that? -[Raymond] Yeah. -Yeah. -Well if you are, there's something I must show you. -[Raymond] Okay. -Something real special. -Okay? -Okay. [Niva] Come with me. Serious, Grandmaster Flash, and... the Furious Five. Mm. Interesting. I want you to see where the real versions are. I wanted you to see these Lichtenstein. [Niva] Does it remind you of your work? [Raymond] In a way. The way the lines, you know, wave around. Not exactly all my work. Everybody's work -on the subways. -Mm-hmm. So, you really want to be an artist? I am an artist. [Niva] Oh, I know you are. That's why you're here. Please sit down, I wanna talk to you. Don't be frightened. It's okay. Sit down. Please? [Niva] Please, get comfortable. So, are you really serious about commissioning me to do a painting for you? Absolutely. I really like your work. I think I will need, like, at least, a hundred dollars in material. [Niva] Oh, that's no problem. I'll give you two hundred. No problem at all. Let me do that. [paper rips] Here we go. Thank you very much. [Niva] My pleasure. So... How does it feel? [Raymond] It feels great. [Niva] When do you think I can have it? [Raymond] I can start on it as soon as possible. [Niva] Terrific. [spray can rattling] [hissing] [hissing continues] [Rose] Raymond, what you doin' here? What is that? [Raymond] It's a painting. [Rose] Yeah, on Crash's canvas, right. [spray can rattles] [hissing] [Raymond] I bet you'd be fooling around with your friends a lot. -What do you think is... -It's stupid, -you know what I mean. -...what I'd be doing with them? Yeah. -What the hell you care? -I've been quiet about it. I've been extremely quiet about it. [spray can rattles] All I've been wanting to do, is show you, by this, and all the other things I've been doing... that I really wanna be a man, and I, and I wanna continue being your man, you know. [spray can rattles] I mean, what do you think I'm doing? I mean, you know? I wanna prove it. -And how you gonna do that? -[spray can rattles] [train rumbling] [rumbling continues] Oh, shit! Look at that. Hey! Oh, shit. Fucking kids in the back of a car. Did you see that? [Rose] Do you wanna go to the yards with me? [Raymond chuckles] Are you crazy? [Rose] Just me and you. Late tonight. Come on. [Raymond] All right. [kids screaming] Yo, man. That kid, Vic, got stopped tonight, man. I'm telling you, man. You was rockin' it, man. -Word. -You had the party jumpin'. -You know it, man. -But they... I knew they wasn't gonna give it to you, man. -I known it. -A hundred dollars, man.
