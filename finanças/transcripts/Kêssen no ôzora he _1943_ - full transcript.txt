FIGHT WITHOUT CEASING! TOHO WITH PERMISSION OF THE NAVY As long as there is at least one plane even if the enemies are numerous I engage in battle with no fear, and I always come out victorious! A time of the intrepid has come A new time! TOWARD THE DECISIVE BATTLE IN THE SKY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE NAVY NATIONAL BUREAU OF INFORMATION STUDIO TSUCHIURA - NAVY AIR CORPS BASE Eyes right! Ready, front! Today, we are commencing official certification exams. I am here to test your performance. TRAINING HALL The training apparatus comprises... a control wheel and pedals. Now, I will explain how to operate it. Let's begin! Come closer! This is the control wheel. Below are the pedals. Right here is the switch for the electric vacuum pump... ...that is responsible for movement. The operation of the control stick and pedals... ...is exactly the same as in a real plane. The only difference is that the training simulator does not fly. So no matter how many mistakes you make, you can never crash. Now, I will show you how it works Watch closely. First, I turn on the switch. If I move the control stick to the left, the plane banks left. If I press the left pedal... ...the plane turns to the left. If I press the right pedal... ...the plane turns to the right. Is everything clear? Yes. Alright. Seperate into your groups! If the plane drifts to the left, press the right pedal. When the plane tilts forward, pull the stick back. Good, the position is correct now. Press the pedal harder... harder. You're tilting forward, pull on the control stick. Now put the control stick back in the vertical position. Turn left. Control stick to the right. There you go. Hey, Akimoto! - What? You should've seen yourself. -What do you mean? Yamazaki, you looked scared yourself. What did you say? At ease! How did your exams go? Kurai, did you pass? -Yes. But my grade wasn't very high. -I see. You're modest. Yes. And how did you do? I did my best. I had to pass... ...because I had a bet with Kurai. Did you hear that? Hey, Azuma! -Yes? You're going to serve in reconnaissance. That takes a particularly good pilot there. Try harder. Tomorrow, your air training finally begins. Time to show us what you can do. Now you begin to apply all that you have learned so far. Eyes... left! Attention! Our motto is... "Fly with the heart!" Commence training! Trainee Tanaka, number 8. Commencing dual training! Number 12 had landed! Number 12 has landed! Trainee Akimoto, number 11. Commencing dual training! Trainee Ogawa, number 3. Completed dual training. Trainee Akimoto reporting for training. -Get in. Ready for take-off. What about the goggles? What's under the belt? A picture of my mother. Concentrate on the plane. Forget everything else. Tonegawa is on the left side. In front and to the right is Mount Tsukuba. Keep your eyes open. If you move the control stick to the right, the plane will bank right. If you move the control stick to the left, the plane banks left. If you pull the control stick towards you, the plane goes up. Now back to the wings-level position. Use Mount Tsukuba as a reference point. Wings-level position. Keep Mount Tsukuba in sight. Look, a plane! INTENSIVE TRAINING CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS KANTO REGION, TSUCHIURA MILITARY CAMP Go! Again! That's Katsu-chan. He still can't do it. Muramatsu! Stand aside and watch how others do it. Next! Attention! You are now allowed to leave the camp. But you have to be back by 16:00. While you are out... ...do not forget that you are military students. Conduct yourselves impeccably. Get some rest and come back full of energy. That is all. Dismissed! Right turn! Right! Forward march! Welcome home! Hello! We're back! Come in! Sister, you have to say, "Welcome home!" You think so? This is their home. Welcome home! Checkmate! So quickly... Didn't you manage to capture any? I get to flick you. Agree? -Agree. There you go. Does it hurt? Let's play again. Let me play. -No, I have to even the score. Alright, but only one game. -Okay. A flick again. -You're no good at shogi. No jokes this time. -This will hurt even more. I'll definitely win this time. -Help yourselves. Thank you. Everyone seems shy. Help yourselves. Thank you. Let's eat! No jokes! -Sure. Shige-chan, have some. -No, thanks. In that case... -No way. Let's eat, everyone. -Let's eat. You're already eating your bento? As soon as I have some potatoes, I get really hungry. Ma'am? Ma'am! Why do you call me ma'am? Sister... Our brothers are military students. They call all women ma'am. Oh, I see... Here is the older ma'am. Hello. I'm always glad to see you all. Mom! -What? All our brothers now call our elder sister ma'am. Isn't that funny? My daughter studied in Tokyo. When she finished school, she came back. Nice to meet you. Have you been assigned to reconnaissance? Yes. But in order to become real pilots, we still have to train a lot more. Ma'am, where is Katsuro-kun? He's been sick since yesterday. He's in bed upstairs. Really? He's a sickly child. I'm worried about him. Mom, Katsu-chan is exactly like the other boys. He'll be fine. He just needs to believe in himself. It's just a cold. Keep your head up. Get well soon! -Alright. Brother, being sick isn't any fun. -That's true. He's sick all the time. We promised to sow bindweed during our disembarkation. Your what? -Our leave today. -So... -Yes. In the navy, every floor is called the deck. Ma'am, sailors use naval terms for everything on land. I see. Sister! -What? Our brothers even sleep in hammocks. Right? Kurai fell out once. Not true! That's what you said! -Yes, you did. Because you pushed me. You dreamed that. What's that on your sleeves? This? One stripe means ordinary seaman. Two stripes - able seaman. And three means seaman first class. It must be interesting to serve in the navy. You must all be happy. -We are. We made lots of mistakes at first. Hey, Kurai, do you remember your conversation with Akimoto in the sauna? I do. It was funny. Hey, Akimoto! -What? Do you remember that conversation we had right after being drafted? When I promised to wash your back? I've been looking for you for a long time. -I was looking for you too. But that sauna was the size of a lake. I hadn't known that. It was so crowded. I was washing his back. I hadn't finished, but then I heard the commander's voice. I didn't understand at first, but someone said his name loudly. They were calling someone from the senior class. Why aren't you responding? Attention! Sorry, I didn't realize you were a senior student. Keep washing my back. My mistake. That senior student's name was also Kurai. Do you feel better listening to these stories? When I first put on the uniform, I was really happy. Hey, Takeuchi! -What? The uniform looked like a sack on you. -Even walking was difficult. Don't expect the uniform to suit the body, adapt the body to suit the uniform. Stop mocking our commander. We haven't been in the navy for long, but we already know how to take orders. Except that one... Yatabe! -What do you want? Come over here. Ma'am, he's such a slowpoke. Even when our commander calls him, he doesn't always respond. Today, we will begin to learn how to relay messages. You have come from many different parts of Japan. Back home, you used different words for the same things. But when you send a message in the navy you cannot afford to make a mistake. Save your informal speaking for when you are on leave. When you are on duty, forget all your everyday words. Is that clear? At ease. Kurai! Are you from squadron 19? No, I'm from the 21st. -Correct yourself. I'm sorry. I'm from squadron 21. Are you from squadron 21? -Yeah. Do not say 'Yeah'. Correct yourself. Yes! Good. You are not allowed to use 'Yeah' on duty. Yatabe! Yes. Correct yourself. Again. Yes! Are your parents well? Why are you looking at me? What's so funny? What squadron are you from? I am from squadron 3. Pronounce the words more clearly. Do not swallow the final letters. Again. I am from squadron 3! Good. Do not hesitate. Respond promptly and clearly. Yes. Again. Yes! Good. Yamazaki! Yes. -What are you looking at? Are you dear parents well? Yes, my dear parents are well. -Wrong. Do not call your parents dear. Yes, my parents are well. -Good. Are there any questions? -No questions. Do you remember that game with an egg-shaped ball? That was hard. It was. Ma'am, it was so hard. Eyes right! Attention! The blue's ship has been hit. The blue's ship has sunk. The red fleet has won: 3-0. Blues are dismissed. Reds stay. Salute! Attention! Right turn! Forward march! What conclusions can be drawn from today's game? Your attacks lack spirit. I will show you how to do it. Get in position! Come here! Now you will have to conduct an attack like that. I will try to stop you. You will have to break through. Azuma! -Yes. Let's go. Come here! Your attack has failed. Now Yamazaki will attack. -Yes. Tanaka. -Here. You will stop him. Let's go. You will stop him. Let's go. Bad. Try again. Alright, enough. Come here. You will need this kind aggression, not only in rugby. You need the will for victory in battle too. You have to kill the enemy, no matter what it takes. The commander praised me, and I was so happy that I forget all my troubles. Did you? -Yes. Don't you ever get sick? We do sometimes. When we eat too much. I still get sick at times Once, I spent a week in bed. And I still ate too much. That time, I woke up in the middle of the night... Commander? -How are you feeling? Are you better? You look better. Don't get up. Commander, you didn't sleep? Don't worry about me. Get some sleep. Thank you. Men don't cry. Alright, I'll go to sleep too. I even started to cry. Your commander is really like that? He's strict, but very kind. For me, he's like an elder brother. Wow... Do you remember last year's parade in Tokyo? It was pouring. He was so kind to us then. It was Navy Day, wasn't it? -Exactly. I bought a postcard that day. It was a great day. Probably because the military orchestra was playing. We saw the Imperial Palace then. And then walked to the Kudan Hall of Valor. Sling... ...arms! We were accepted into the military at the Yasakuni shrine. We felt that it was a great honor. And then we were given an incredible reception in the Sudacho district. Were you there? -Of course. I was also honoring the soldiers. Where exactly? Not far from Sudacho. Unbelievable... Honor the young aviators! Banzai! Banzai! Did you buy a postcard that day? -Yes. It was a wonderful day. We have to get back to our unit. -Really? So soon? Thank you so much, ma'am. Katsuro-kun, get well by the time we come again. Take care! Goodbye. Sister, you should say, "Come again soon". Come again soon. We will. What a wonderful Sunday. Everybody wanted to help our Katsu-chan. I felt bad. Why? Everyone wants you to get well. I'm useless. What are you talking about? I'm so weak. Not at all. You just need to think how you can become more like the others. Then why does everyone call me a weakling? But you can try to become stronger. When you couldn't vault over and your instructor told you to step aside... ...why didn't you ask to try again? I was very upset that day. For you... ...I'm ready... ...for anything. Come on, Katsu-chan... Again? Katsu-chan! Leave me alone. Katsu-chan! Don't touch me. Ma'am... ...these are things belonging to our neighbor, the veteran. They need to be repaired. Would you like to take some? Of course. My daughter is here now. We can take more. Then... Katsu-chan! How many times do I have to tell you?! But I'm sick. But you've been well ever since the sailors came. Why do you keep saying that you're sick? I try, but then I get a headache. You always say that. You just think you can't do it. What you're doing is wrong. Sister... What? Would you be able to do this? -What? All you're learning is how to serve tea and put together bouquets. You could do real studies. You do nothing but rest and have fun. Sister, did I upset you? Sorry, I was just kidding. Sister! It was just a joke, I didn't mean it. Welcome. Good afternoon. Why are you so pale? Ma'am... ...at the factory where your husband works... ...is there an opening for a kindergarten teacher? But... ...why are you asking that all of a sudden? Mom, are you okay with that? I thought about Katsu-chan... What does that have to do with Katsuro? Even if he's not being serious... ...I don't want him to think that I lead a carefree life. Ma'am, please. What a nice sister he has! Will you ask your husband? I'll talk to him. How did you like the picture? Which picture? We were talking about your marriage. I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. But... ...I'm so attached to Katsu-chan... ...that I don't need anything else. You don't want a husband? You've misunderstood. Excuse me. Katsu-chan, are you ready? Sister, do you get very tired at work? Not that much. You started working because of what I said? I'm sorry. Don't say that. Ready to go? -Yes. Math and PE again today. Why do you say it like that? If you want to, you can do the impossible. I know. -Brother! Hurry up. You're going to be late. Coming. Katsu-chan! -What? Don't strain your eyes. Okay. That's enough for today. Just a bit more. No. You can't do everything at one sitting. Every day you ask for a bit longer. But it's very interesting. Your interest can be maintained for three days. It's better to get up early in the morning. Enough. Okay. Oh, sister... ...the trainees finish their studies at exactly this time. Do they? First, loyalty is the sailor's main duty! Second, the sailor behaves himself! Third, the sailor strives for valor! Fourth, the sailor maintains fairness! Fifth, the sailor lives simply! Tomorrow, finally, we begin the third training stage. I'm on duty tomorrow. Kurai, let's get our photo taken during the next leave. Not a bad idea. Are you going? Yes. Get ready for bed check! Check! Squadron 28 is ready! Wake up! Five minutes to line up! Wake up! Five minutes to line up! Line up! Left turn! Hats off! Bow to the Imperial Palace. Imperial regulations! First... ...loyalty is the sailor's main duty! Second... ...the sailor behaves himself! Third... ...the sailor strives for valor! Fourth... ...the sailor maintains fairness! Fifth... ...the sailor lives simply! Reporting. -Go ahead. Commander! -I'm listening. Reporting. First lesson - engineering, second - algebra... ...third - geography, fourth - communications... ...fifth - servicing, sixth - chemistry... ...seventh - weaponry. No accidents among the students. Good. Leaving for duty. Everyone, sit down, please. Say "Let's eat". Lets's eat. Careful, don't drop it. Eat your rice. Don't drop any. Commander! Squadron 3 is ready for lunch. I'll be there in a moment. -We're waiting. Commander! Squadron 5 is ready for lunch. I'll be there in a moment. -We're waiting. Attention! Bow! Attention! Bow! Listen! According to orders,... ...as you've been notified,... ...beginning today, you are all promoted to the rank of seaman first class. You must serve as an example to the younger trainees. So, in the afternoon, you are to hand in your stripes. duty trainees in each squadron... ...will collect them and hand them over to the instructors. Carry on. Attention! Bow. Sit. What a beautiful death - a parachute among blooming cherry blossoms Great song, isn't it? Yes, did you write it? No, a paratrooper did. I thought it was you. No, I don't have any talent for it. Maybe but you can write a song. At least as good as that one. Try. I'll help you. Come on. Teacher, thank you for your help. I have urgent business. -Not at all. How's your younger brother? He's well. Thank you. I did it. I jumped it! Sister! Are you getting out of school just now? Sister, I was able to vault it. I did it three times. Katsu-chan! Katsu-chan, why did you run ahead? Sister, the newspaper people are here. What do they want? I see... It's good that you're here. These are my children... And these are newspaper people from Tokyo. Nice to meet you. Katsu-chan, do you remember Sekine-san? Yes, I do. He used to often stay at our place. Yes, he was very diligent. For the attack that Sekine-san carried out... ...he received a letter of commendation from the armed forces command. We're talking to everyone who knew him during his studies. We need this information to write an article about him. They say he was a cheerful person. -He was. He was always agreeable and polite. When I complained about a headache... ...he would say, "Ma'am, let me give you a massage." Yes. And he always smiled. What exactly did Sekine-san do? During an operation in the Indian Ocean... ...he crashed-dived into an aircraft carrier. He did? Here is a picture taken during that battle. We should all be grateful to him. Tatsuo Sekine was your older brother-in-arms. You must follow his example and develop the same fighting spirit. You have to fight without any second thoughts. It is sad when graduates die. But a pilot may have only one battle. It's all or nothing. All your energy has to be put into one decisive blow. There is no life and no death... ...no pain, no youth... ...and no self. When you are focused on the edge of your sword... ...pain ceases to exist. When you become sailors... ...your body stops belonging to you... ...and the 'you' does not exist anymore. One who is ready to die for Japan... ...shows his utmost vigor and fighting spirit. In order to win a battle... ...you need all your fighting spirit... ...and all your vitality You need to forget everything and sacrifice yourself for your goal. Fighting spirit and a willingness to sacrifice oneself... ...are prime qualities of sailors of the Navy. Sekine possessed them both to the highest degree. When Sekine was a trainee, everyone loved him. Today, we learned of his sacrifice. Morooka! -Yes. Do you know what I'm thinking about right now? I do! Hey, bunny... Sekine-san loved you so much. Hey, Morooka! -What? Is that what you were thinking about? Look, he wants to say something. This window... ...once Sekine-san bumped into it and cracked it. He said, "I'm so sorry." He was genuinely upset... ...and I said I'd have it fixed. He said, "Don't. Leave it as it is." "I'd like to carry out a plane attack." He cut those planes out and covered the crack. Now it's so precious to me. I want it to remain like this forever. This plane... ...is diving, as if attacking. That's how it looks to me. Once... ...Sekine-san said, "If one does something great..." "...it's okay to die young." "Masatsura Kusunoki sacrificed himself at Shijonawate when he was 22." "Deeds and thoughts keep on living in the form of spirit." He said that, putting his hand on my head. Really? Sister! -What? I'd like to go to where the sailors live... ...and see that cute little bunny. I'd also like to see what life in his unit is like. Do you really want to? Let's go next Saturday. Will you go with us? -Yes. If I show up in these dirty socks, everyone will laugh at me. They need washing. -I'll do it right away. Thankfully, our boy's gotten healthier. Can you swim? -No? All the trainees can swim now, even if they couldn't before. Straighten your legs. The left leg too. Good. Let's go. Next! Roll over backwards, put your hands on the ground. Like this... Don't raise your head! Bend more. Press your chin to your chest. Good. You too, press in your chin. Do not straighten your back! Can you do the exercises you have seen? Given some training... ...any healthy person can do them. Over! Over! Next. Victory! Good. Next. Victory! Today, you displayed great fighting spirit. With this kind of will to win... ...we will beat the American and British forces. Still, there was something lacking in your fighting spirit. We need to train further. In order to become like the great Admiral Yamamoto... ...your scream has to come from the bottom of your heart. Again! Again! Again! It was great. The commander showed us everything. He was so polite. Sister? What? I'll become a pilot too. I'll pass the exams to become a trainee. Really? You really want that? I do! And I will do it too! You will... Ma'am! Sorry there's so much. -I'm glad to be of help. It's an honor to send something to the front-line. Shigeko, why did you do that? It was mine. I tied them myself. Look. What's this? They're different. This one is too long. Now this sailor will limp. I tied them really well. How do you like it? But now one can easily tell the right one from the left one. That's not good. We should put that in too. What is it? This is soil from our camp. This is where all our training took place. I think the pilots will be glad to get some of it. It will be their best present. It brings back the best memories. Tanaka-san, what about your song? -Now would be a good time. Young trainee Yokaren's hot blood Seven buttons and an anchor on his sleeve Today, I am also in Kasumiagura Full of hope I rise to the skies. It's beautiful. Do you like it? We wrote it together. Ma'am, what about those little charms? Mine? -Yes. Here. -They're so cute. Take one. -Thank you. Great! Your stripe is coming off. Let me fix it for you. That's fine, I can do it myself. I can do it quickly. Take off your shirt. Thank you. You don't have a mother, do you? -No, I only have a father. Someone's at the door. Why can't a sailor limp? What? Hello. Hello. You're sending something to the front-line? At ease. Welcome to our home. -Thank you. Thank you for your continuous support. Not at all. Commander! -What? Why can't a sailor limp? What? No one has told you yet? No. There is a marathon over 10 thousand meters. Did you say 10 thousand meters? -Yes. It is the main annual event for trainees. Really? -All the units compete. Afterwards, the average time for each unit is calculated. This way, the winner is chosen. If even one falls behind, the total score will decrease. Squadron 21, ready! Is everyone ready? Steady... go! All the trainees, in a group... ...start every three minutes. Squadron 36, ready! Is everyone ready? Steady...go! The first thing you need is the will to win. There will always be someone who gets tired. In our unit, one trainee couldn't keep running. The other trainees then lifted him and ran together, supporting him. After resting a little, he managed to finish the marathon by himself. Keep your spirits high! This way, the unit didn't leave a single trainee behind. The total score was excellent. 20 seconds! The unit becomes even more united. No one must limp. What? Is anyone sick? -Everyone's well. Take care then. -Yes, sir. I'd like my brother to participate in the marathon someday. What? Did you say someting? Sister! Right! I see. You want to become a trainee too? To us he really is like a younger brother. In order to become a trainee everyone has to pass them exam. Right now, your body is still too weak. Ready! Good. Ready! -Good. Ready! Good. Muramatsu! Louder! Muramatsu! Ready! Launch boat 18! Launch boat 17! Launch boat 16! Launch boat 15! Launch boat 14! Launch boat 13! Raise the sail! Are you waiting for me? -Yes. The teacher finally praised me today. Did he? -Yes. So I haven't been waiting in vain. -You haven't. "Muramatsu has been doing well lately." Is that what he said? Did you hear him? No, but I can imagine. It's great. Look! Tomorrow, they'll become real pilots. AFTER DINNER Does it hurt? -Damn, cut faster. Look, it's missing five prongs. Get on with it. Hey, look! I've got a map of Japan here -Let me see. Listen here! On the 25th... ...you will have bayonet training. As I always say... ...fighting spirit is the most important thing. Kill your enemy with one strike. Do not hesitate. Is that clear? Everyone, line up! Count off! At ease. Attention! Reporting! Everyone is lined up! Get in position! Get in position! Get hammocks down! Attach! Graduation day is approaching. It's going to get hotter. We need to be careful. Alright. I suggest having more boat training before graduation. Alright. Let's do it. -Yes. Prepare the schedule. -Yes. Instructor Yamashita! -Yes? Did you get this jam from home? Let me have a taste. Come on. -No way! Give me some. This is a treat for the trainees on Sunday. Sorry. Just a little bit. -Commander! Trainee Tanaka is here. Do you have only your father left back at home? Yes. You sent postcards home... ...to your mother, to your older and younger brothers and sisters... ...saying that you are doing well. Why? I sent them to the house where we go when we're on leave. Why? Everybody is so kind to me there. They are like family to me. I feel very good there. That is why... So you feel at home there? Yes. I am ready to give my life for Japan... ...and so thank them in this way. There is no elder brother in that family. Are you like a brother to them? -Yes. Instructor Mitamura.... ...enough talking. Alright. I understand. You can go. Yes, sir. He's like a younger brother to me. And for them, he's an elder brother. Wonderful. It is indeed. Come on! Again! Do your best! Everyone! The tea is ready. Please come in. Yes. Thank you. Let's go. Thank you for studying with Katsuro on your day off. I'm very grateful to you. -It's nothing. We enjoy it. Thank you. Help yourselves. -Thank you. Where are Morooka-san and the others? They wanted to train more. I see. Good. One more time! Come on. I can't. A bit more. Come on. Just a bit. Sister, there's a letter for you. Really? South mail, 694. From Kenji Nakazawa. Who's that? For Shugieda Muramatsu-dono. "Maybe, you're a young girl or woman..." "...or an old lady with many grandchildren." Not at all! This must be from the young man who got our package. Really? Hey, Morooka! Come over here! "I'd like to thank you for the wonderful package." "I was particularly touched..." "...by the soil from the Tsuchiura camp." "I too studied in Kasumigaura." "I spent a whole year there." "When I took the soil in my hands..." "...I felt real fighting spirit and willingness to sacrifice my life." "I was moved to tears." "Your home welcomes trainees." "This is praiseworthy." "I wish them to be diligent." "In your package..." "...I found a song, written by young pilots." "In it are echoed all the feelings I had during my studies." "I was deeply moved." "A composer who works at our camp..." "...wrote music for these verses." Do you want me to play it? -Yes, please! Young trainee Yokaren's hot blood Seven buttons and an anchor on his sleeve Today, I am also in Kasumiagura Full of hope I will rise to the skies We follow our elders' example If we are zealous, we will prevail We are strong and determined Full of fighting spirit The Japanese fear no enemy The trainees are brimming with energy Strong arms and a fiery heart Here we are, taking off from the nest And flying over the rough sea In order to strike the enemy positions The young pilots are ready to give their lives High spirited on the wings of victory I will send my mother a picture Of the enemy ship sinking after my strike Today... ...you will dismantle and study the engine on your own. Since you may be stationed at the front-line with no mechanic to help you... you will perform this yourself with no teacher. Be careful when taking the engine apart. That is all. Get to work. A bullet hole. Where? Right here. Indeed! Today, this is study material. But last year, it took part in a battle. It was chasing an enemy plane or searching for an enemy ship... ...in order to attack it. The plane was Nakazawa's. It was one of our graduate's favorite planes. Captain Kenji Nakazawa? Do you know him? Yes. The family that we visit got a thank-you letter from him for their package. I see. Commander! In that package, trainee Tanaka put in some verses that we'd written. Captain Nakazawa sent back music for those verses. He always loved songs. NAVY AIR CORPS CONSCRIPTION "The secrets of one's mind may not be known to other people," "but the creator of heaven and earth is able to tell if they are good or evil." Good. Next. Read the text which you can see clearly. Go! When you see a white dot, say "Te!" Te! Now back. Good. Next. Close your eyes, lift one foot. Go on. When you hear the watch ticking, make a fist. Teacher, what are you doing? Today is a very important day. So, please, be good. I need to pray. Good. Next. Inhale. Hold your breath. Good. Next. Mom! Mom! I passed! Really? I got accepted. -Great. Congratulations, brother! Thank you. Katsu-chan! Sister, I passed! Congratulations, brother! Well done. Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations, congratulations. Mom! It was only a medical exam. I see. Commander! -What? Katsuro Muramatsu was accepted into squadron 6. Really? Well done. Here are your things. Try this on. -Yes. Do you like it? -Yes. Come on, button it up. -Right. Great. Button it up faster. You look very young. How old are you? Sixteen. -I see. He has a sturdy neck. What's wrong? -It's taking so long. Here he comes. Brother! Katsuro! Mom, look at my uniform. Turn around, let me have a look. Katsu-chan! You're so handsome. Brother! -What? When will go on your leave? Silly, what leave? I just started service. Mom, this is our commander. My name is Ishida. I will take care of him. Do not worry. I'm so glad. Thank you. From now on, you will serve in squadron 16. I am the squadron commander. Your squadron is your family. Your commander is your father. The boatswain is your mother. The squadron commander is your elder brother. From now on, you have a new father, mother, and brother. In relation to everything that concerns your training... ...everything you do not understand or cannot do... ...you have to report to your squadron commander. This way, you will get used to navy life faster ...and become great sailors. Your parents back home... ...your brothers and sisters will know you are safe. This is all. My brother Katsuro has started his service. Shigeko. There's a postcard from Shige-chan. -Let us see! TRAINING ON A WARSHIP Katsuro-kun has started service. -Really? She's asking about our training. Shige-chan! Today at 2:30, there'll be a broadcast from the front-line. Let's listen to it with our brothers. Our brothers are leaving us today? Yes. Now that Katsuro-san has started service... ...what does Shugieda-san think about our matter? I think everything will be alright. Really? Great. We have more good news then. Yes. Mom! You heard everything? Who is it for? -We're visiting Katsuro at the camp. Your young pilots are finally graduating. Yes. Today is their last day. I see... Hey, Muramatsu! Aren't you going on leave? To the club? -That's right. You can't go home because you're sick? Do you want me to pass on any messages? -No. Mom will come visit me. I see. Let me set you cap straight. Sister, how's the soup? I think it will be delicious. You've become so handsome. Sit down. Isn't it a bit hard? -Not at all. It's interesting. You even speak differently now. You think so? What is it? -It's your favorite. Sushi? -Yes. I won't take it. Why not? We are fed really well here. Give it to Shigeko. -But... I just had noodles and soup. I'm so full. Thank you for your help. Come on! One, two... heave! Great. That's enough. Thank you so much. You really helped us out. Is anyone goingi to repair this bridge? Yes, we need do it. -I see. Listen! This bridge has always helped us save time. That's true. Let's help. Where are our brothers? I'm home. -Welcome back. They aren't here yet? Strange. What could have happened? Even if they were walking, they should have been here by now. I was able to go to the camp and back. And the soup was ready a long time ago. Strange. Shigeko, what are you doing? Oh! I almost forgot. Starting recently, all listeners can now receive live broadcasts from the front-line. Captain Nakazawa describes a bombing attack on objective N. "On day D, month M, our squadron..." ...received orders to bomb enemy airfield N. I was in charge of the attack. I had a unit of young pilots under my command. Once in the air, we quickly found our bearings. In H hours we were over the enemy base. A large bomb was dropped on the hanger. I was satisfied. Then, enemy planes took off. My unit immediately opened fire. The enemy planes started falling like leaves from a tree. However, one of our planes was also hit. A long trail of smoke appeared in the sky. But the plane managed to keep up with the rest. Hang on! Hang on! We accomplished our mission, one plane returned with a damaged wing. As you see, determination helps you come out on top... ...and creates one more barrier to avoid defeat. So we returned. We returned to base with no casualties. The most important thing is to avoid thinking about life and death... ...about space and time. Our young pilots were determined. They will soon become real sky-warriors. Continuing the cause of the older pilots... ...they will the destroy the English and American forces." Next, we will broadcast a song from your pilots. Trainees from the Tsuchiura base put this song in their package to the front-line. It was received by Captain Nakazawa. He appreciated the verses. At the base, there is stationed a choir of young aviators. The radio waves will carry the firm voices of these young men... ...across thousands of miles directly from the front-line... ...and unite all of us. You will hear this in a minute. Where can they be? Maybe, they won't come at all? We are about to begin. It's impossible. I have to see them again. After all... Young trainee Yokaren's hot blood Seven buttons and an anchor on his sleeve Today, I am also in Kasumiagura Full of hope I will rise to the skies The trainees are brimming with energy Strong arms and a fiery heart... We're here! Here they are. Quick! Your song is on the radio. Really? And flying over the rough sea In order to strike the enemy positions We follow our elders' example If we are zealous, we will prevail We are strong and determined Full of fighting spirit The young pilots are ready to give their lives High spirited on the wings of victory I will send my mother a picture Of the enemy ship sinking after my strike This ends our live broadcast from the front-line. Where have you been? We had some business to attend to. The soup was ready a long time ago. There is almost no time. Stay a bit longer. This is out last time together after all. Let's eat. Let's eat! -Help yourselves. We will join you. And this is for Katsuro-kun. Thank you. Katsuro-kun, let's eat! Are you all graduating today? Next we will go to the temple and then to another camp. And from there, to the front-line. We might never meet again. Is that really so? Listen to the broadcasts from the front-line from now on. That way, you'll hear about us. I'll be waiting. We will never forget this house. And we will never forget about you. Let's eat. Why aren't you eating? We forgot. As soon as we eat the bento, we'll have to go. We have to be back in time. -Alright. I thought I'd get to play with my brothers today. It's not fair. Shige-chan... ...there will be other trainees, you'll have a good time together. Yes, but... Thank you. The food was delicious. Goodbye. Attention! You took great are of us. Thank you so much. I was glad to do it for you. Attention! Bow! Attention! Bow! Attention! Today, we dine together... ...for the last time. The chief said recently... "This graduation is just another step in your training." There will be no breaks. One who wants to become a pilot... ...has to keep moving forward. Do you understand? Attention! Sling... ...arms! Yokaren second year trainees,... ...Seaman First Class Saburo Morooka and 300 others. Yokaren second year trainees... ...finished flight training... ...on August 15, 1943. Salute! Salute! At ease. Caps off! Caps on! About face! They're coming! Thank you! We're grateful to you!
