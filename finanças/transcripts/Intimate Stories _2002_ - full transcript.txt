He's not odd, he's nuts. - Did he say anything? - Yes, he wants to go to San Juli?n. - What for? - It seems somebody saw Uglyface. - Uglyface, that dog! - That's a lie. - What did you tell him? - Nothing.

I'll just take a minute. Here. What's wrong with you, Justo? Nothing. You looked weird this evening. Me weird? - Yes, you. - No, I wasn't weird. Come on, I know you, don't lie to me. What's wrong? Gonzalez stopped by and... ...he told me he saw Uglyface in San Juli?n. Dad, I'm sure the dog is not Uglyface. Yes. Probably you're right. He's not worthwhile such a long trip. I told Carlos I'd go get him. I must be crazy. I told you San Juli?n is too far away, dad. I must be getting old. - Who is it? - Your coat is ready, sir. - Coming. - Sir,... - Yes? - We couldn 't get the same button. - You couldn 't get the same one. - No, sir. - Is it so hard to get a similar one? - It is, sir.

In this business holidays have disppeared, Garc?a. - That's true. - How's your company? So so. When the owner of the company was in charge... ...he used to import many tools,... - Yes. -...sales were huge,... ...but now his sons are in charge... The old man left business? Yes, sort of, his sons are... What are you selling now? Now his son import these things, elastic bands,... -...these little stars... - New things. - Yes. - Because nowadays everything is visual. - Made in China. - I'll tell you something. All this stuff... Tell you something, Garc?a, let me tell you,... ...nowadays people who can't improvise, disappear. What's your situation? Now I don 't work on comission any more,... ...they don 't pay for my expenses,... ...they just pay for the gas, what can I do with that? That's all I got. That's what they did to me 5 years ago. But they did me a favor. Although they didn 't think so. I'll show you something. This book, Garc?a, this book changed my life. Because nowaydays selling is a science. I've underlined a wonderful phrase here, listen to this,... ...listen carefully, "Never think of failure as failure,... ...think of it as an opportunity to change your course." - What do you think? - It's okay, fine. "Think of failure as an opportunity to apply... ...my techniques". Do you follow? - Very good. - This is wonferful. - It is. "Remember Edison, who had to face more than a thousand... ..."no", before his light bulb was accepted." - We're talking about Edison ! - He was an inventor. We can 't get depressed. Listen, listen, there's more. This book changed my life. Listen, listen to this. "Learn the grammar of the human body,... ...if the prospect buyer who's before you... ...leans forward it means he's interested." Lean forward. Lean forward. - Yes, yes... - See? - This shows interest. - It's a good thing. - "lf he leans backwards... - You won 't sell anything. ...you 're losing him". Buying and selling. Buying and selling, but with the body. - See? - Clearly, clearly. This is it, the world has changed. I we don't move forward, we move backwards. If we don 't update our methods we are lost. Yeah, right. Hey, Fatty, Fatty, come here. - Come here, please. - OK. You 're a few lbs. overweight. - Are you or not? - When you start asking questions... No, listen, what if I told you can lose those pounds... -...in a week? - You want to sell something. You needn 't suffer, go on diet,... -...what would you say? - You want to sell something. Listen, would you like to lose 13 pounds in a week? - Fuck off. - Would you? - Nothing. - Fatty, l have something for you. - It's on TV. - This time you won't sell anything to me. Look. The add's on TV, they're plasters to lose weight,... -..."Fat away". - No. - The add is on TV. - Don 't you watch TV? - Very little. With these plasters you can lose 10 pounds in a week. Didn 't you say 4? 13, 10 pounds, 5, what's the difference? Why don 't you trust me? This was made in Sweeden, top quality. Listen, today's the most important day in my life,... ...l can 't sell you this, you 're not the right person for this. Ready. Now I just have to wait, in 10 minutes he'll be ready. BAKERY Good morning. Hello. I'll go fetch your cake. - Today'll be a wonderful day. - I hope so. - Your husband? - He's asleep, he's very tired,... ...he worked all night in your cake, poor soul. - He's a real pro. - He travels a lot. He's always studying, now he's taking a course in the internet. Here it is. What do you think? It's really... ...a work of art, really. I didn 't expect it to be so nice, it's wonderful. I'm glad you like it. I'd really like to congratulate your husband myself. He didn 't write "Rene". He didn't write "Rene". You see, I asked your husband... ...to write here "Happy birthday, Rene",... ...do you understand? But he only wrote... ..."Happy birthday". Couldn 't you... add "Rene" there? Me? If I touched of my husband's cakes he'd kill me. I can wake him up, if you want. No, no, it's okay, we can't wake up the cook... ...for such a stupid thing. - No, it's great, it's great. - Okay. - It's great. Do you want some candles? - Yes, please. - How many? - I don 't know, really. Don 't you know how old he's going to be? He's a small boy, l think 9 will be okay. I was sure he was your boy. No, he's a widow's son. I know her because I used to sell woods to her husband,... ...poor guy,... not long ago he was run over by car. She owns a notions store in San Juli?n, it's on the... -...main street. Do you know it? - No. - I haven't been to San Juli?n lately. - I see. - It's a long trip. - It is. Don 't leave it in the sun, it'd spoil the cream. I'm glad you told me. Is the widow young? Yes, she is. Poor woman. I didn't stop visiting her because she's alone. So she told me it was he son's birthday. How nice. I think it'll be a nice surprise. -Of course it will. -She doesn't know I'm taking the cake. lt'll be very nice. These are the best. Thay are new. After you blow them they... ...light again by themselves. I think this one doesn 't work. Yes, it works, but they are for kids,... ...they don 't blow as hard as adults. Hi. - Good morning. - Is everything okay? - Yes. Where are you going? San Juli?n. San Juli?n is over 170 miles from here. I know, lady. I live around here. You may go now. Have a nice trip. Don't you want a ride? I'm waiting for a friend, he's a truck driver. Is he going to pick you up here? Everyday at 3 he's here. Come on, man, I'll drive you. Get in, come on. - Do you like music? - So so. Give me a CD, they're in there. Here. - What kind of music do you like? - Any kind. Let's see. Were you planning to walk to San Juli?n? Look, lady, I've lived here for 50 years. I know every truck driver in this highway, I'm sure... ...one of them would drive me. So you were hitch-hiking. I buy you breakfast. No, thanks, lady. - Are you sure? - I am. Okay. Give me the thermos, I'll get water for your "mate". Okay. That's fine. I like that. You 're very kind. - Shall I fill it up? - Yes, check the water and oil too. - OK. - Do you know how to open the hood? - No. Here it is. How are you? - Fine, and you? - Just fine. How's the store? - Fine, thanks. - Where are you going? To San Juli?n, to pay the taxes. - Did you see the guy who was here? - There he is. Trying to avoid me? - I brought you hot water. - Thanks a lot. I'm Julia. Beneditti, Justo Beneditti, pleased to meet you. - The same. Want a cookie? - No, thanks. What are you doing here? I work for the government. For the government? They hired me to pick up people walking by the road. Don't laugh, it's a community job, and you refused to get in. - Why are you going to San Juli?n? - No reason. But are you going to visit someone? Just killing time. - Have you killed a lot? - Quite a lot. Now seriously, I went on this trip to think. - I'm a biologist. - A biologist? Yes, I study molecular biology and I live in Argentina. Two things that don't match. Shall we go on? What do biologists do? They study life. Life? People's life? People, animals, plants... Animals, for example, dogs,... ...can they understand? If dogs can understand? What do you mean? Understand what? - Things. - I don't get it. If they understand things. I don't get the question. Does a dog understand if something is right or wrong? Yes, animals can understand clearly what's right or wrong. You mean a dog understands if something is wrong? Yes, I think so, but... ...that's not my special field. You often go to San Juli?n? I never go there. But Gonzalez told me he saw Uglyface, my dog, in San Juli?n. When did he get lost? He didn't get lost. He left. Are you OK? I'm okay. What's wrong? Nothing. I think you need fresh air. We're near Tres Cerros, we'll stop and see if... ...they have a doctor there. I'm feeling better. Let's go see the doctor. I'm all right, believe me. - Never mind, he'll have a look at you. - It's not necessary. Come on, grandpha. Do it for me. Zip you jacket, it's very cold. - Good morning. - Morning. Yes, what is it? This man is not feeling well,... ...he's a bit pale, I think. I think it's his blood pressure, he's so pale. Sit down, I'll fetch the doctor. ...it's an incredible machine... ...that will help you lose weight,... ...inches, fat, and mainly... ...you'll be doing the most effective aerobic excercise. How do you feel it, Kimmy? I'm having fun, I don 't want to stop. I can feel how my muscles are working, it really is... Your blood pressure is very low, you must stay... -...here for a while. Norma? - I can 't stay. - I must go. - No, you can 't. - Yes, doctor? Bring him a glass of salty water and fill in the card. I'd be very irresponsible... ...if I let you go like this. - I have to go. - You can 't go. You stay here for a while calm down and when... ...you feel better you may go. Well, I must... leave,... ...l must go on the road again. I can 't stay. Good luck. Take care. What's your name? - John. - What else? - Dough. - Dough. Where are you from? - Aguada Cecilio. - Aguada Cecilio? That's right. - See who's arrived. - Okay. - Here. - Who was it, Norma? - The guy who comes for treatment. - Let him in. Come in. - Hello! - How are you? How's your ankle? Better, better, it hurts a little when I walk but... ...it's better, a lot better. - I'll have a look at it. - OK. How are you? Why are you here? -What's wrong? -You know him? Of course, I've known him for 20 years, he owns... ...Fitz Roy general store. Remember me? I'm Roberto. You 're wrong about me. I'm from Aguada Cecilio. You move your ears, don 't you? I don 't move anything. Let me see your ankle. -I think she's ready, contractions take longer. - OK, I'm coming. Could you put this cake in the fridge, please? Norma, put it in the fridge. Thanks. Be careful, please. - Where can I have a cake decorated? - Decorated? - Yes. I had the cake made but they didn 't write the kid's name so... Here bakeries are no good, I tell you. It seems I bought any cake, but I had the cake made... ...specially for this kid. - First aid ward? - Yes, come in. A man came here looking for his father,... ...an elderly man who got lost in this area. - Where is the man from? - He's from Fitz Roy. There's an old man here, but he's not from Fitz Roy. He said the old man might be going to San Juli?n... Your son is coming, you must wait for him. - See you. - See you, man. How much are these ones? - 3 for $1. - Give me 3. - Thank you. - You 're welcome. Is that a red van? No, it's a car. Fill it. - Good morning. - Good morning. What are you up to? Would you like a "mate"? Thanks. Your ankle is better,isn't it? Where are you going? San Juli?n. Want a ride? I'd be grateful, Roberto. Now you remember me. My memory never fails me. -Don 't go, I'll be right back. -Okay. -Use hot water. Hello? How are you? You recognized me. No, no, I'm in... ...in Catamarca. No, I don 't think I'll go there until next month. Yes. But you never know. No, I just called to... ...to say... ...to say happy birthday to Rene. Yes. What? You told me. Okay. Because I never forget those things. Okay. Okay, the same to you. I send you my regards. And a kiss for Rene. Another one for you. Okay, see you, see you. - Are you in a hurry? - No, I'm not. I'll be back in 10 minutes, I just want to see... ...if they can correct something here. - Okay, I'll wait. - Okay. Listen, if you see my son don 't tell him I'm here. - I won 't, don 't worry. - He drives a red van. Don 't worry. Take one if you want. - May l? - Yes, of course. - They look nice. You 've got many trophees. My husband is a wrestling instructor. - You don 't say. - He is. That's his weakness. Okay, okay,... ...let's see if you like it. I think we have a small problem. What's wrong? They... ...they're different. I mean, it's obvious the kid's name was added later on. The style of "Happy birthday" is different from... ...the style in "Rene". It is. It looks like a graft there. My handwriting is different. Excuse me, what's your name? - People call me Vaucha. - Vaucha, do you know... ...what Charles Wilson said? This man who became a millionaire selling things... ...said that creativity, the ability to improvise... ...and spontaniety make the difference. What I mean is this, lady,... ...let's be creative and find solution for this,... ...I'm sure we can solve this. Come on, Vaucha,... ...l know you can do it. - We can do something. - What can we do? Tell me. We could take off the first letter in "birthday"... ...and then I could write it with my handwriting. I can write it again. I think it'll be okay. - Perfect. - What do you think? - Perfect. That's the solution. How long will you take to do it? - 10 or 15 minutes. - Okay, I'll wait for you. - Today you didn 't call me. - I didn 't. - I went shopping. - When ? - In the morning. How do you know I called if the phone didn 't ring? - I just know. - It didn 't ring in the morning. - Just once. - Who was it? - Fonseca. Fonseca? What did Fonseca want? He knew you're coming today. - You love Fonseca! - No, Alberto! - Lier! - Let me go! - Bitch ! You 're crazy, you 're out of your mind, Alberto! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Jealousy is a horrible illness. Horrible. It destroys everything, it destroys people,... ...feelings, everything. I'm telling you because... ...l know about that. Because of that illness I lost my wife. Poor Ana. At first she was happy. The thing is I used to travel a lot, I've always traveled. When I got home I wanted to know where she had been,... ...what she had done, everything. - I tired her. - Like on TV. - What? - Like on TV. - Yes. Can I have another one? Yes, please, have all you want. A jealous salesman. Oil and water, right? As time goes by you see things in a different way. Live and learn. How old will Rene be? Frankly, I don 't know him. I don 't know, but he's a small boy. He's a client's son, but I've never met him. My niece's name is Rene too, but she's 15 already. Okay, okay. Let's see if you like it now. It's great, yes, excellent. Give me the check, and I'll take some cookies too. Don 't you have a nicer wraping? Don 't you want a box? - That'd better. - Yes, I'll tie a ribbon, it'll be very nice. - May I ask you a question? - Yes, of course. For you, Rene is a boy or a girl? What do you think? I had a great-aunt whose name was Rene. She wieghed 280 pounds. When she died they made a special box for her. If somebody, anybody says Rene,... ...what's the first thing that comes into your head? A boy, a girl, what? I knew a football player, Rene Pontoni, an excelent player. He scored a great goal. He headed the ball downwards, it was a tricky play. The goal keeper run to catch... ...the ball, it bounced and jumped over his head... ...and went into the goal. Rene Pontoni. I'm so stupid. I'm really stupid. What if Rene is a girl? The cake is a ball. What if I get there, ring the bell and... ...Rene is a girl with curls? What will I do with the cake? Maybe she likes football. Now I remember she told me... no, I asked her,... ..."who takes care of Rene?" And she said: "He's with his granny now." "He's with his granny"? Or did she say: "She's with her granny"? "He's with his..." "She's with her..." Do me a favor, Mr. Justo,... ...do me favor, see the box in the back? - Yes. - Take que lid off. I've got it. Nowadays only those can improvise survive. Tell me what you think. See the cake is ball? We change its color,... ...we add a little head and 4 little legs. ...what do we get? What? A turtle! Don't you see it's a turtle? A head, four legs, that's it. It's okay either for a boy or for a girl. - Good morning, officer. - Good morning, sir. I'm looking for a bakery here in town, do you know...? No, there are no bakeries here,... ...bread comes from Deseado. I need to have a cake decorated, it's here... - Have a cake decorated? - Yes. - No, not here. - No. - No. And who makes birthday cakes around here? Well, my mother in law makes excellent cakes. - Does she? - Yes, very good. Where does she live? - You enter the town,... - Yes. -...four blocks to the right,... - Yes. ...one, two, three houses,... ...a white house with curtains, that's her house. - What's your mother in law's name? - Haydee. - And your name? - Morales. Sabino. Let's forget this is a ball. - We'll only use the shape. - Only the shape. So if I add... if a add a little head here,... - Yes. -...and I add four little legs,... ...two legs here, two legs here and a small tail,... ...what... what would l have? What do you see? A cat? No. No, it's not a cat. - A bunny. - No, not a bunny. - It's not a bunny. - Haydee,... ...think, think carefully,... ...what could it be? So I think it could be a... -...a turtle. - Perfect. ...Just perfect, a turtle. Could you do it? - Yes. - Great. - I can do it. I'm leaving now, l leave you alone so you... -...focus on the cake. - Okay. Great! I see you like palm trees. My husband liked them. That's why he decided to grow them. He used to say the Patagonia would be like Brazil. - Like Brazil. - And Brazil would be a desert. Okay, now you can see it. Let's see if you like it or... -...if you don 't like it at all. - Geat, let's see. What can I say? She'll love it. - Nice. - Honestly, what can I say? It's a... She'll love it. How much do I owe you? It's on the house. No, no, I can 't,... you worked so hard... -...no, I want to... - Next time I'll cook the cake. You 're an angel. A few days ago I calculated... ...I've worked for 20 years... ...and in these 20 years I've driven about 1.6 million miles. Do you think I'll get a medal for that? - Have we arrived? - We're near.
