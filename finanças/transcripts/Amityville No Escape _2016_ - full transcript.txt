Are we rolling? Yeah. Okay. Hello, I'm George Harris, and this is my thesis project on fear. Myself and the camera man, What's up? Simon, and three other friends are gonna be going into the woods in complete isolation to, hopefully, better understand fear. Is that good? You got it? Yeah. Cut it. Uh, he uh, George wants me to do some sorta diary, so here you go. We are on our way to pick up George and Elizabeth. Uh, we're gonna pack up and go. The, they wanna go to Amityville, you know, get spooky ghosts. I don't know why we have to drive so far when we have perfectly good ghosts here. And here we are. What are you doing? Get out of here! What are you doing? Oh my God! Uh. Shut the camera off. Well, here it is. Uh, called a bunch of people, got a bunch of emails, went back and forth through a lot of people, but I finally got it. This is the original '97 Amityville tape. Uh, hopefully, it has, it can shine a little bit of light on some of the stuff that I'm trying to figure out, but it's here and I have it. And, we'll see what happens. Hi, babe. It's me. So, I decided to bust out your brother's wedding gift to us. And here I am using the camcorder. So, I decided that I'm gonna make some videos as I move into the new house that we just closed on right before you got deployed. So, um, I just wanna make sure you don't miss anything while you're overseas. So, I figured that we could watch them when you get back, and, okay I'm gonna show you the house. Okay, three, two, one, ta-da. Look how cute it is. Woo! Okay, so this is the front porch. Look how big it is. We can get a new patio set, and put it here. And then we can eat breakfast together out here in the mornings. And, um, it needs some new paint, but that's okay, it's gonna be great. I wish you were here. Okay, um, all right, let's go inside, okay. And we're inside. Okay, so I haven't seen it yet either. Whoa, there's a lot of stuff in here. Okay, this is great. Uh, okay. So then this is the living room area through here. And then this is the other side. Oh, this is so cute, okay. And then through here is the kitchen. So we have our fridge, and our table. Oh wow. Awe. You can see right outside to the backyard. Oh, that's beautiful. And then this is our sun room. Oh, I wish you were here. Okay, so now we're going upstairs. And we're, huh. There are a I, oh gro, oh god, ew, uh. Oh great, okay well, that's gross. Okay, um, oh god. Oh, and they're crunchy when we step on 'em. Oh okay, uh, okay, uh well, this is one of the rooms with two tiny beds, but we'll bring in a nice big bed, won't we? Get it? All right, so, going through here. Hello. And... What's this? Oh, well, oh. Oh, it's really humid in here, uch. Mm... Ooh. Ah, that's so squeaky, okay. Yep, that's enough, okay. Um, I'm gonna go into the really creepy basement now. Okay, let's, oh god. Oh, oh god. Okay, well, like, this could be nice if it was finished. Put some storage in here, could be cool. Um... Hm, there's a lot of broken glass back there. Okay, well, that's good to know. And water. Oh great. Oh shit! Yep, okay. Yeah, so the basement is a no. Um, you can go down there when you get back. Nice big strong man. Uh... 'Cause I, wow, scared myself half to death, okay. Um, yeah, but that's basically the tour of the house. Oh, you'll love it, okay, so there's a firing range actually just down the street. So, you can keep up with your gun play. Um... So yeah, all right, well that's my first video. So, I love you, a lot, and I miss you. Ooh, that's cold. Oh, come on, see, why don't you join the party? Take your top off, pop the top. Uh, hey. So, y-you get upset when I film you earlier but not, now it's okay? You know, it's a little thing called consent. Woo. Isn't this kinda weird that's your brother over there, or... Not, I mean, it's kinda like when we were kids in the bathtub, except more tattoos. You're shuttin' off that camera now. Hey, shut that camera off, and you're deleting it right now. Now! We're on our way to pick up Simon's friend Lisa now. I've never met her, and I'm very excited that she's gonna come aboard because she's gonna give us a fresh perspective on the situation. Sarah? Yeah. What are you afraid of? Oh god, um, obscurity. Really? Yeah. I'm fairly confident that's not what it is. Well no, I mean, like, it's not even so much that, it's just that I'm afraid of being alone. Does that make sense? Like, - Kinda. If no one else knows who you are you never existed. If no one, if nobody knows you, if you don't, if you're alone, you, did you even exist, where you even there? It's like if a tree falls in the forest, you know? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mother Earth herself, Lisa Sheets. Come on, come on. Here it is. There you go. Come on. Lisa? Yeah? So, what's with the chickens? Is it, do you have them for the eggs, the meat, what's the deal? No, I just, I-I wouldn't eat them. I think that they're cute. Uh, I like having animals around. They make me feel at peace. I like submerging myself in nature, and taking care of animals really makes me happy. Seems like a lot of work for no eggs or meat. You know? Yeah, I guess, like, people have cats and dogs, you know. Yeah, yeah, they're like pets. I love chicken. Sandwiches. Fried chicken. Yeah. Gross. You might think that the chicken thing is weird, but I think it's weirder that you wanna go out into the woods to experience fear when the woods are so peaceful. It's a little bit different in Amityville, I think. Like, Amityville, Amityville? Yeah. Is there a problem with that? I thought you said there's nothing to be afraid of in the woods. Why do we have to go there? Because this is a thesis on fear. So, uh, what are you afraid of, big brother? I think, um, we're gonna wait 'til we get on location to discuss that. He's afraid of letting our father down. Hi, babe. It's me. So, I'm gonna start my aerobics workout. And this is so you know that all of this is gonna be ready for you when you get back. So just, don't laugh to much when you watch this, okay? Just, all right, okay, here we go. Hm. Hm hm hm hm. Hm hm hm heh. Hi. Uh, can I help you? Oh, um, I have a delivery. Oh, my groceries, great. Come on in, come on in. I never thought I'd be delivering groceries to this house. Wait, what? Uh, I don't wanna go... Oh, that's okay, you want to have a glass of water or something? Yeah, come on in, come on in, make yourself at home. I mean, I haven't really yet, but come on in. All right, um, hi babe. It's me. Um, so, funny story. So, I had our groceries delivered, which is crazy, right, and kind of adorable. Um, but the guy who delivered them started telling me about, um, that our house is the haunted house of the town. That apparently everybody knows about except, um, us. So that was great to find out. Um, so, it's been kind of weird. But I talked to Doctor Stevens, actually, and she told me that I should keep talking to the camera. Which I was gonna do anyways to keep you updated, but she thought that if I kept talking to it that I wouldn't feel so lonely, or so anxious. So, now I just feel really weird and embarrassed, and this is really awkward, but it's gonna be fine. And if I hate it then I'll just throw the tapes down the garbage disposal and you'll never find out. Um, so, it's great. Um, but the house needs a lot of work. Um, we need new wall paper upstairs. And the floors are gross. Actually, all the floors are gross. And, oh, and the toilet doesn't flush either. So I had to go outside, and get a bucket, and then bring it in, and then fill the toilet with water, and then I, I'm just way too... Tired to be doing all this, but it's fine. And, So, it'll be great. Um, but you know, that's probably why we got the house for so cheap, because it's haunted. 'Cause there are just so many ghosts in here. And maybe the ghosts will help me fix the toilet. 'Cause you're not here to do it. Um... But I miss you, and it's gonna be great, and I think you're really gonna love it when you get back. And I promise I'll make it really pretty, and not too girly. Um... Yeah. And oh, and the idea of there being ghosts in this house is not an April fools joke, so don't try to pull that, cause I know you will. Um... Yeah, so that's it. Hey. Hi sweetheart, it's me. Um, just getting ready for bed. I miss you, and I hope you're safe. Um, and I wish you were here. Okay, well not, not here in this bed because this bed is small, and old, and creepy, but in a nice big bed that I actually ordered today. So, hopefully, it'll be here soon. But, yeah, um... Come home soon, I love you. Excuse me, sir? Yeah. Do you have a moment to talk for a second? Sir, how does it feel, like, to live in the most haunted city in America? I enjoy living here, but you know, all this ghost stuff, it's all hype. So you don't believe in the ghosts that... No, no, I mean, most of the time it's just, it's just stories made up for tourists like you to come around and spend money. Do you, personally, believe in the paranormal? No, no, I can't say I do. But I would probably avoid the house. You know, those people, they don't like people steppin' on their lawn, a-a-and you know, people have harassed the enough. If I was you I'd just, I'd just avoid it at all costs. I-it makes sense, I'm just tryin' to get to the center of why people say that this places is haunted if the people that live here don't believe it. Because of the books, the movies, I mean, it, it's all just made up. Do you think the house is haunted? Oh, I mean, I've been there a couple times, and it's pretty freaky, but mm, I don't know. I don't know if it's haunted. Do you know where it's at? 'Cause we really wanted to go down there, maybe get a couple shots of it. You wanna go down there. Yeah. Okay, well I could get you the, the address. I have it, I know the address, but it's gonna cost ya. Really? No, no, just messin' with ya. Yeah. All right, let me write it down for ya, here. Cool. Okay. Yeah. Uh, where's your pack? Maybe you could lend a hand. Hey, I got the camera goin'. Uh, you keep doin' what you guys are doin'. Guys, we got about 40 more minutes of daylight, and about 100 yards away, let's go. Got our camp all set up, now we just need a roarin' fire. He wouldn't let us bring any marshmallows. Okay. Here we go. It's me again. Here I am. Um... It's just been such a journey. Um, I, oh, I went to the hardware store this morning. Which, I, gonna be honest with you, didn't know what I was doing, had no idea what I was doing. Um, but I found some new stuff, to, like, take down the gross wallpaper that's upstairs. And so, hopefully, I'm gonna use these muscles, do it all by myself. And, um, I miss you. So, that's nothing new. It gets really cold at night. And I miss you cuddling with me, um, to keep me warm. But, things around the house are going better, I guess. I put in a lot of orders for different stuff, to, like, come in. Um, I started going through all of this stuff that the previous owners left. I guess they didn't wanna take it with them and didn't wanna live with ghosts. So, I started going through it. So that's a new project, because you know, I have nothing better to do with my time, than add another project. Um, but found some pretty cool shit. So, like, some of it might stay. Um, we'll see. And then I brought in our stuff. And that's getting kind of organized. I don't really know where you want everything, so I'm just gonna put it there, and then if you don't like it when you get back, then you can just change it. Um, but yeah, and it's been nice outside. Like, the weather's really beautiful. There's a couple patches of, like, these purple flowers around the corner by the shed that are really beautiful. So, hopefully, they probably won't be here when you get back, but that's okay. I'll take pictures of them. All right, so we're goin' on a field trip. And I'm gonna take you outside. Yeah, look how great the paint looks, babe. This is gonna be so fun to do all by myself. Phew, and it's hot outside. Hey, did you hear all those guns? Remind me of you. Goin' around the corner. Look how cute these are. Okay, well those are dandelions, but I'm just gonna leave 'em, awe. Goin' around the corner. Okay, look how pretty these are. Now, I don't know, oh god, that was a bee. Okay, no, we're fine. It's fine. Awe, look how pretty these are. I don't really know anything about flowers. I could not tell you what these are named. But they're really pretty. I miss you, and I love you to the moon and back. And, come home soon, okay? All right, you guys, pizza. Everybody take a slice, please. I know you guys are hungry. Uh, vegan. Oh, okay. Thanks, though. W-what are you doing? What... I'm eating. Lizzie. She wants pizza. Good. So, you're eating grass. It's not got a lot of... No, it's clover, it's good. It's kinda sweet, you want some? No. Yeah. Mm. No seriously, it's nice. Like, if you bite, like, right here it's kinda sweet. That sounds terrible. You're really eating grass? No, it's clover. Oh, okay. - Why, why won't... - Duh. Why won't you eat the pizza? I'm vegan. So, about this video, what is it exactly? That is really bright. We're doing a documentary on fear, uh, what people are afraid of, why people are afraid of these things, what made these people afraid of these things to begin with. What are you afraid of? I'm most afraid of people. We, as a species, are capable of such beauty and loving, and yet we hurt each other. What? Hey. No, no, no, - keep going. - What we're doing as a species to this planet and our blindness to that is terrifying. So that's why you eat grass. I think she's afraid that people will find out that she doesn't know anything. That's what I think. So, what makes you so right about everything? It's just daddy issues. I wouldn't take it too personally. I don't know if anybody remembers what I said, but you guys check your phones? - Uh... - I, mine's dead. I got no bars. - Yeah. - Mm, right. - No bars. - So service, exactly. Isolation. It lets us enjoy the spirit of the nature, like, really immerse yourselves in it. I don't know, I'm just gonna miss Tumbler. Check that out, look at those skills. What was that? It's just a dog. That is not a dog. It sounds like a wolf. It couldn't have been either. I was a boy scout, I kind of know these things. - Give me the camera. - Don't go, don't go. - No. - Let me see it. I'm goin'. Simon, just give him the camera. Come on, give me the camera. You're not goin'. Of course, I'm not going. Just let him go. No. Hang out with the weird chick, I'm goin'. Hey. What? I'm going with you. Why, why does she get to go? So, I'm sorry about that comment earlier, the daddy issues comment. I just, I didn't like how you were talking to her. You were kind of cutting into her a little bit, and she's a nice girl. II know, it's all right, like, you know I'm gonna talk about dad at some point, anyway. So, I understand, it's fine. All right. What are you doin' out here! Uh, we're camp, we're camping, there... Camping? What's with the camera? We're doin' a project for school. What's with the gun? There's dangerous animals out here. What are you doin' out here at dark? Yeah, we just heard an animal, and that's why we were comin' out here to check it out. You're damn right, you heard an animal! So you come lookin' for it in the dark with nothin' but a camera? Yeah. Are you outta your mind? No. I mean, no, we were just, we just wanted to know what that noise was. Look, son, there's dangerous animals out here all over this place. My girl went missin' about a month ago, my daughter. And I been lookin' for her. You got parents you care about? - Yeah. - Of course. Well, unless you want them goin' through the same thing I am, you will get your ass back to that campsite and stay there until it's light. - All right. - Well, this, this is a public place, I mean, we're not breaking any rules, we're just... You're right, you're right, you're not breakin' any rules. But you want your parents to get some kinda nice little letter about what happened to you when you get hurt out here? Liz, come on. - All right. - All right, okay. All right, we're going. So, with George out of the picture, what actually scares you? Where you all serious about what you were sayin' earlier, or, explain it a little bit better. Yeah, I mean, I mean what I said. People scare me more than anything. I mean, what we do to each other, what we're doing to the environment. Just think about the ozone layer, and climate change, and I mean, like, terrorist attacks. I mean, the wolf in the woods, it could be a person, someone that wants to hurt us. I mean, if it was a wolf, then it's hungry, but if it's a person, it's just cruel. Do you believe in the supernatural? I believe there's something out there. Everything has a spirit, everything. And with what people do to each other, they can be so ugly to each other, I feel like there must be some kind of vengeful deity, or evil spirit. Okay, so I found another gem upstairs today. Oh, you're not ready for this. Oh, you are not ready for this. Okay, I'm gonna show you. Ta-da! Right? Right? Who keeps this? Me, I'm gonna keep it. This is hysterical. Buttoned, unbuttoned, buttoned, unbuttoned. Okay, I'm gonna button it. This makes me feel like one of those, like, 19th century matriarchs who treats their kids like shit, and then expects to be taken care of when they're older. Actually, you know, I can jut hear the kids downstairs now. And they're really hungry. 'Cause I forgot to make their dinner. He's gonna be so mad. Hey, you're back. Didn't know where you were. Hey. Did you find the spooky animal, snarling beast out in the woods? - There's no animal. - Nope. Eh, what did I tell ya? Hey, Simon. You know, you're the most fearful person I know, and uh... Not. Just form knowing you for so long, Dude. And knowing that you were afraid of the high dive, You don't go- - And you, basically, pissed your pants the first horror movie you went to see. I wanna know what you're afraid of. You know what, I'm gonna take a shit. Come on. And I'm gonna film it for posterity, and you can put it in your little documentary. Whatever, George can suck it. Chinese piece of shit. This place is spooky. Oh, yeah, that's, that's nice. There you go, George. You can put that in your video. Uh, hello? Shit! You know what I'm gonna ask you, 'cause you're next, so... You never played hockey, but always had that stupid mask. My biggest fear is uh, slasher flicks, or you know, masked killers. I know it's generic and, I don't know, stereotypical, I guess, but, I don't know. George used to torture me when we were kids. He'd run around and, he would wear that mask, and I just, I don't know, it scared me. And I guess it stuck with me. All right, camera. All right. Be careful with it. Yeah, how do you even operate this thing? God. Heavy. Okay, so, George, what is your biggest fear. Really? Well, you're movie. You know what my biggest fear is, kinda. Well, I might, but the people that are gonna be watching the documentary don't. My dad used to take me to games, and, like hockey games, and baseball games all the time. And he always used to, after the trip we would go out for ice cream, and he would tell me about how when I grow up, I'm gonna be just like he is, and I'm gonna be just as successful as he is, and that one day I'm gonna be able to send my kids to school. And... I remember one time I was telling him about how maybe, that's not what I wanted to do with my life. And I remember the look on his face was the same look he gave me when he tried to break it to us that mom was leaving. And that's when I realized that I can't let him down. So, I'm afraid of failure. That's the bottom line, I'm just afraid of failing. I can' fail. Give me the camera back. Hello? Uh... Hello? Do... Do you need help? I have an idea. What you thinkin'? How would you feel about going into the woods with a camera by yourself. You mean, not like, by myself, I mean if you guys, like, followed behind me. No, that's the whole point, it's by yourself. That's the scary part about it. That's what you're afraid of. I'm not going in there on my own. Guys, guys, we're not alone. There was somebody out here. There was this little girl. She was, I don't, I don't know. Oh my god. She was just walkin' around. It was... It was probably a deer. A deer? It was a kid. I saw it plain as day. She was gone, I, I don't... If there's a kid out there, we should go try and find her. You're afraid of the dark, you're probably just spooked. I am not makin' this up. If there's a little girl, we're gonna go find her. So, let's go, okay? Yeah. Come on. Come on, Simon. You comin'? This way? Yeah. I'm back. Um, here we are again. Uh, I'm in the kitchen this time. Um, things have been good. I slept really, really, well last night, actually, surprisingly. Um, I don't know, it was like you were here last night. It wasn't as lonely. And it felt like your arms were around me. Um, I missed that. Uh, yeah, uh, things have been good. It's been really sunny out recently. It's been gorgeous. And, oh, okay. So I bought these new mugs that are so cute. Look how cute these are. We don't have room for them, but I bought them anyways, 'cause I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry, I love you. Uh, but yeah, um, it's good. I think my plan today is to organize the kitchen a little bit, 'cause I've been focusing on other rooms. So I'm gonna come back in here and go through the plates, and um, the spoons, and all of that, but uh... Oh! Okay! So, I bought this new patio set. And so, hopefully, that's what's coming in. Oh, you're gonna love it. It's so cute, it's so cute. We're gonna, um... Um, hello? Hello? Hello? Jesus. Is anybody out here? Hello? So, how far out did you see her? It wasn't too far, but then again, I got kinda thrown off, you know, I was, she was there, and then she wasn't, and... Hey, hey, stay with the group, don't go too far out. I just wanna find this little girl. I'm not afraid of the woods. I just don't wanna lose ya. Lisa's one with the woods, guys. Hello? Hey, we know you're out there. Oh my god, stop. It's a deer. Oh. Was she like... She looked lost. Does she look like your age? Uh, what, what was she? Real, real, little. She looked like, I don't know, kids get lost on the trail all the time. Oh, yeah. Come on, Lisa, don't go that far ahead. Okay. Yeah. She probably saw the fire and wanted to, you know, she's probably lookin' for help. Yeah, maybe she saw our fire, you know. Maybe she's walking towards our campsite. - Nope. - Hello? She is not waiting. Yeah, she's persistent. I just wish we could stay together. All right, I'm gonna, oh god, wait up. Hey, don't leave me. Everybody, stay together. All right, uh, I'm back. Um, last night was terrible. Um, I woke up in the middle of the night, and um, scared myself half to death, actually is what happened. Um, I don't know, I, like, must have just, like, been making a video to, like, say good night and left the camera on. And I, like, fell asleep, and was sleeping really soundly, and then something, I don't know. There was some, like, noise or some thud that happened and scared the shit out of me. And I woke up and saw, there's this red light on the camera, and I don't know what I thought it was, like a rat, or like a bug, I have no idea. And, yeah, so um, but it's fine, and it was my fault, and I guess I just left the camera rolling all night, and didn't think about it, and fell asleep. Um, so I'm exhausted, 'cause I couldn't fall back asleep, um, at all. Um, but uh, yeah, things are great in the house. Um, it's not as drafty as it has been the past couple days. Um, 'cause I'd sealed off some of the windows upstairs. Um, I started painting the second guest room, blue, 'cause that's your favorite color. Um, yeah, so it looks really good. Actually, I like the shade of blue, and actually, I'm doing a lot better job than I thought I would. It all looks really even. Um... I miss you, so, like, that hasn't changed. Um, and hopefully I'll sleep really well tonight because I'm so exhausted. Yeah. - So. - It's me. Is anyone else freaked out about not finding that little girl? I mean, I'm worried for her. Yeah. Just a little bit. I... What? I didn't expect to see somethin' like that. None of us did. It's so weird, a little girl in the middle of the woods by herself. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's gotta be an explanation. You think maybe, uh, I mean you know where we're at, I mean, you think it might have been a ghost? Oh, come on. Oh, come on with that, dude. It could be. It, you never know. There is no such thing as ghosts. You're so certain? Well... I mean, you don't see them. You know how sometimes you look at, like, a really tall, looming, twisty, tree, and it just looks kinda evil? Like, you see it. Nah. You lost me. That's what I believe in. That... You just don't get it. No one gets it. I mean, other than that it's been a pretty good trip. I would... Yeah, speaking of, great. Oh god, ew, that's my brother, that's... - ew. - Great. I feel sorry for you. Is it like this all the time with them? Oh god, I don't know, probably. Come on. Ew. Well, uh, just throwin' it out there, I mean, this would be the perfect opportunity for a threesome. Ho ho, oh my god, dude I'm a graduate, okay. My experimentation days are over. Yeah, we'll just be over here, Harder. And you can stay in that part of the tent. Well, I mean, - Yeah. The offer's there. Good night, Simon. Okay, I'm back. So, um, yeah, I've just been feeling really creeped out being here along. Um, yeah, so I um, I went and talked to Doctor Stevens again, and she told me that I should learn how to face my fears head on and do some research on the house, because then, maybe, I'd feel better if I knew some of the history of it. I don't know, whatever. So, I went to the library and found this book. So, um, I'm gonna read you some of it. Um, okay, um, in 1974 a family were found shot dead in their beads, and the oldest son was found guilty of committing the crime. He had claimed that an evil presence was speaking to him throughout the house and that it had, in many ways, seduced him into committing the crime. He's still in prison to this day. Since then, several families have moved into the house and shortly have left afterwards claiming that the house is haunted. Okay, um, well that explains how all this furniture has just been left over. This place is like an estate auction. However, two of the families who claimed to experience paranormal activity in the house all went on to attempt to gain publicity for books and movies using their experiences, which has deeply harmed the validity of their claims. Most find it to be outright lies. You hear that, sweetheart? We could be famous. Um, well, while I was at the library I found another book that I thought would help me even more. So I found this gem. Um, let me just show you the first page of this so you can just really see what I'm dealing with right now. Uh... I'm so lonely, if you can't tell. And so needy. Um, I want you to come home. Yeah, 'cause this, this, this, this book ain't, it's not cuttin' it. So, um, yeah. I miss you a lot. Yep. What are you doing? You missed all the good parts. Do you love me? Of course. Would you do anything for me? Yeah. Okay. Look. It's the house. The house. Yeah, like, the one from all the stories. This is it. I didn't want the other guys to see it and get all freaked out 'cause we're camped right around the corner from it, but, this is it. Can we go back? There's nothin' to be afraid of, it's just a house. Pretty cool though, right? Yeah, yeah, sure. Let-lets go back. Let's go back. Hi, it's me. Um, I actually feel a lot better after having done all that research on the house. And um, I don't know, maybe Doctor Stevens was right that we're just afraid of what we don't know. So, yeah, it was a good day. And um, I have a lot planned for tomorrow, actually. And um, I miss you! Can't sleep? Nope. Mind if I join ya? Not if you're gonna film me. I'm just using the light. All right. You can't sleep either? Nah. I ended up calling the police last night. I just woke up, and I kept hearing all of these noises, and I didn't... I didn't know what to do. And they showed up, and they were so nice, and so polite, and they walked all the way around the house, and in every single room, and all the way in the basement. And I... And there was nothing. Nothing in this house except me. So, by process of elimination I'm the problem. I just, I don't get it. You know, I have a 12 year old sister, and she can stay home by herself, but me, I can't. I can't be here by myself. But you know, the one good thing about the police showing up is that every single neighbor came out to see what was going on. And there I was in my pajamas on the porch... Like a moron. Because there was nothing in the house. You know... I should be able to do this. I want you to come home and be proud of me, and all the work that I've done here. I'm really sorry. Okay, well I ordered some new stuff for upstairs. Hopefully, that's what that is. Hi, um, yeah let's just go around back. That'd be great. Okay, guys, we're close. So, Elizabeth, what do you think about your hike of the damned in these spooky, ghost filled woods? It's a little more annoying when you have that camera in my face all the time. I can get closer. Oh, yeah, that'd be great. Oh, what's on that? But yeah, so far so good, I guess. What's wrong with your girlfriend? She's just driving me crazy. We still goin' the right way? Yeah. Yeah, mister nature man with his compass. I'm sure of it. Back this way, sorry. Ah. Watch it. Brilliant. Ow. Look out for that, Simon. Like... Somebody should start putting flowers it it. It'll probably stay in. This is exactly what you wanted. This is what the documentary's about. Looking good. Awe, you look so pretty. Awe, thank you. Uh-Huh. I'm over it, I'm... Oh, it's you two again. I see you got some more friends with you this time. You got your camp site set up for tonight, all ready? No, I think we're gonna hit the road after this. Well, if you change your mind, you make sure you stay to that campsite after dark. It's dangerous out here like I told you. Dangerous, like a ghost? A lot of people think this is a haunted area. Don't be stupid, boy. I'm talkin' about wild animals. Sir, uh, last night you had mentioned, uh, you were looking for your daughter. Um, we, one of us might have possibly seen something that was uh, may have been, um, a child in the woods. This guy thinks he saw it. Where? Like, up, up the hill back that way. All right, just remember what I said. Stay out of these woods after night. Stick to your campground and you'll be safe. Oh, sure. Okay. Come on, he's. Got that goin'? - Yeah. - Okay, cool, good. All right, guys, we're staying one more night. What? No. What are you talking about? Uh-uh, dude, that's not what I signed up for. Listen, we're gonna pack up these tents, we're gonna pack up our bags, we're gonna go about 100 more yards into the woods, and we're gonna stay one more night. That's all I'm askin'. - Uh... - That's asking a lot. That's asking a lot. Why, 'cause you're scared? - Exactly. - We're all scared. Right, that's the point. For fear, right? That's what this documentary's all about. 'Cause we're all scared, right? We all came... So we're staying one more night. We're gonna get everything packed up, and we're gonna stay one more night out there and really get what we need to get. We signed up to sit around a camp fire and talk about what makes us, w-what our fears are. We didn't sign up... Yeah, dude, I'm not... We're not expecting to run into a man in the woods with a gun. Not cool with this. Everything's gonna be - completely fine. - Whoa. Listen. The reason I have this, That's nice. Is so everyone knows I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. We're safe, okay? So if you're worried about safety or you're afraid of being hurt out there, no one's gonna get hurt. I won't let you get hurt. So let's pack everything up, and let's go to the woods. Wha, no, no. One more night, it's one more night, and that's all I'm askin'. - No. - Put that down, and help me pack up this stuff. Hi, babe. It's me. Um, I'm gonna do another aerobics work out, try to keep the routine goin'. Okay, here we go. Hello? Hi, yeah, uh, no, no, I asked for the linoleum flooring. Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll be here all week. So... Friday morning would be great. Yeah, just let me know whenever works for you guys and I'll be... Hold on. Hello? Hello? I need you to face your fears, all right? Okay. That means you gotta go out there with this camera by yourself, okay. Can't you go with me? No. Like, j-just follow, just follow behind. The whole point is that you're doing this by yourself in the dark, okay? Take this camera, you'll be fine. All right? - Okay. - Okay? Um, if I scream, I mean, if I yell out or something, are you gonna, are you gonna come get me? No, we're gonna wave our flashlights and you can come to us, okay? Go ahead. Okay. All right. I don't wanna be alone. Exactly, go ahead. Oh god, oh god. Help! Okay where are they? Where are they? Help! Help me! Oh, thank god, there they, there. Guys, I think, I think I saw her. I think I saw the little girl. All right, okay. She, was back there. Okay, we'll find her, we'll find her. Oh. Wha... We need to go find help. We need to go, we need to go, we need to go. Ooh, all right. Welcome to the back yard. Um, so I'm just tryin' to clean some stuff up before the contractors come out again. Um, yeah, our contractor's name is Tony. And he talks to me like I don't know anything about building. You know, which may or may not be true, but he's still a sexist. But it's fine, um, so, um, oh god, I'll clean up all of this eventually. Oh, okay, so I wanna show you, um, I don't know, the foundation around the corner of the house has been really weird. Like, on this end, well this, well this is the sun room on this side, and then this is the living room, but it's been, like, sinking. Now I don't really know, like, what's going on. But I, oh, that was a be. But I was... Yep, nope. Okay, it's done, we're done. This is finished. Let's get our packs and go. - Car now. - No, I'm with you. I'm with you, let's go. Okay, everybody grab a pack. Just screw the tents, let's just go. Jesus. Guys, wait up a second. It's so dark, you need to walk in front with that light. This even the right way? - Yeah. - I don't know, I feel like we've been walking forever. Just keep goin' this way. Seriously, we've been walking forever. It's all right, we're goin' the right way. We've been goin' north for the last hour and a half. There's no way that we're goin' the wrong way. We've been going in a straight line this whole time. So, I think we should just continue going in a straight line. Does anybody else have any better ideas than that? - Anybody? - I don't know. I guess just keep going north. Exactly. Didn't anybody bring a map or something? Okay, so I went back outside, after composing myself and building up the courage to do so. And it turns out that it was rust water. So, that's why it was red, because it's just been raining a lot, and it must have just gone through the pipes, and... Yeah, but I didn't have to call anyone, and I figured it out by myself, and progress. So, maybe now I can go fix the toilet by myself too. I can do this. Watch out. None of this looks familiar. None of it looks familiar. Exactly, that's a good thing. Do you wanna hold on to the compass? Do you, would you feel better being in charge of the compass? I don't know what else to do. And we're stuck. We are, we hiked, and we hiked, and we hiked, and we got nowhere. I don't know what's goin' on. What we need to do is go find that little girl and make sure that she's safe. She's right. I'll go. I'm gonna go too. Nah, I'll go. You go straight, and it meets back up... W-w, uh, hold up, um, uh... We took it earlier, we took this path earlier. You go straight, I'm gonna go left, okay. It meets back up. Uh... Just do it, just trust me. I have a lantern, I'll be fine. Just go straight, I'll go this way. We'll cover more ground that way, and we'll find the little girl, we'll meet back up, and we'll go back to camp. Okay? - Just go. - Fine. - Just go, just go, just go. - Whatever. We have to do this. - [All right. - Elizabeth] All right. Hello? Nothin'. I made a couple rounds, and there's nothing. Shit. Simon! Simon! Oh my god. Shit. Oh shit, oh, oh my god. Oh shit! Back on the trail, it forks. His blood's all over my hands. I thought we could cover more ground if we split up, and he was... Oh my god. Guys, I have a radio. Oh, god. Oh thank god. Hello, if there's anybody out, if there's anybody out there, this is an emergency, we need help. What was that? We need help. We need help. What was that? I don't know. What the hell was that. I don't know! We, we didn't find the little girl. We're not gonna find the little girl. We didn't find the little girl. We're not gonna find the little girl. Just, just sit tight. It's okay. We didn't find the little girl. Lisa, we're not gonna find the little girl. The little girl is gone! Lisa! Lisa, stay here! What do... We can't keep splitting up. Lisa! Lisa! Hey, wait up. Lisa, come on. I see the little girl. What? I see her, she's right there. Where? She's right there. There's nothing there. What? I'm going to her. Did you find her? I lost her, I don't know where she is. Get your shit, and let's go. We gotta get outta here, now! Grab you bag, now, go! Come on! We gotta go. Wait up! Wait! Where, where'd you go? Little girl, little girl? Where are you, where'd you go? I know where you are. You wanna play with me? You wanna play? You wanna play with me? Yeah? You wanna play? Oh my god! Stop! No! Stop! What are you, no! Let me go! Keep moving, go. Go, go, faster, come on! Would you shut up, and turn that fucking camera off? It's our only proof of what's goin' on right here, and it's providing us light! You know what, professor, you wanted fear? You fucking found it! Fuck you! Move. Go, go, go! We are. You're not movin' fast enough. We gotta get outta here, now. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We gotta get outta here, go. Go, go, go, go now! Shut up, shut, shut, don't talk, don't talk. Where is she? Take the light. What? No. Take the light. But. Do remember that house I showed you? Yeah. Go straight to that house and don't stop. Come. Just go, I will find you. No, no, no... - I will find you. - Come with me. Baby, I promise, I will find you, go. Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god. Jesus Christ. Help! Somebody help me! Help! Hey, hey, everything's fine. You're okay. Everything's goin' great. Okay? Everything's fine. Listen, this is gonna be perfect, I promise. But I need your help, okay? I know this is gonna be scary, and that's okay. 'Cause it's gonna be perfect. Tag. You're it.
