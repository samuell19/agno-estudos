PITT: Send DeForest in. Your little sortie at the depot was unauthorized. Do you have any idea what you did? Yes, sir. I stopped some men from stealing guns. You also managed to destroy weeks of an investigation. Do you realize that? I had a tip. You had a tip? What about notification to a superior officer? In another few weeks we would've had the whole damn bunch, but all we have now is a burnt corpse which we can't identify. But you had a tip. I don't know. I've-- I've had eight years of experience behind this desk. Behind a desk. I want a full report on the depot this morning. I also want the name of your informant. You're dismissed. [DOOR OPENS] So? What happened? What did he say? It was this bullshit about me blowin' an investigation. [SIGHS] You know anything about an East German named Josef Szabo? I've heard of him. When did we hook into him? While you were on the Torito case. We getting the computers tonight after work? [SCOFFS] It's Christmas Eve, DeForest. Oh, yeah. All right. Tomorrow morning then. Well, if tonight is Christmas Eve, that would make tomorrow Christmas day. All right, all right. So, what are you doin' tonight? I got things to do. Having a little party. Christmas Eve. You know, family. Yeah? All right. We'll do it Wednesday morning. First thing Wednesday morning. Okay. [♪♪♪] [DOORBELL RINGS] Merry Christmas. Well, come in. Uh... I got some things. Here's a poinsettia plant. This is sour-cream coffeecake without sour cream and a chocolate soufflé without the chocolate. I got 'em at the health food store next to the office. Thanks. Where's Ricky? Upstairs. Ricky, your father's here. [HAUNTED GARAGE'S "DEVIL METAL" PLAYS ON STEREO] Heavy, dude. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Hello. ♪ The Crüe is playing On the radio ♪ Mind if I turn this off? [MUSIC STOPS] I said hello. All right, look, Ricky, I know I haven't been around much lately, but you know how much I've been working. I've been busy as hell. Give me a break. Well, so how's school goin'? Sucks. Heh, I heard that. Hey. You wanna go shooting this weekend? What's that? Is that a yes or a no? All right. Tell you what, you think it over and you let me know. Look out there. Got you a present. Thanks. All right, well, your mom is cooking downstairs, so get washed up. I'll see you down there. [SIZZLING] Boy, is he pissed. Yeah, well, you can't say you're gonna be here and then not show up for weeks no matter how good a reason you've got. That case we've been working on, it's over now. So I should have some more time. [SARCASTICALLY] Oh, yeah. No, I mean it. I'm gonna get it together. Look, I thought maybe we could talk about a couple things while I'm here tonight. Why? I think we need to decide what we wanna do. Do we wanna be friends or what? I mean, tonight, why did you invite me for dinner? So your son could have Christmas dinner with his father. Christmas is tomorrow. Why didn't you invite me on Christmas? Because I'm having company on Christmas, Jack. Company? [SCOFFS] Excuse me, but what am I? I don't know. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. Heh, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, well, maybe you're right. Wait. Did I hear you say maybe I'm right? Huh? Jack. Don't push it. All right. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [COMPUTER BEEPING] That's him. He was at the depot. Hmm. Josef Szabo. Also known as Josef Szabo-Menke. Real name: Andrew Stiles. He's English. Emigrated to West Germany, 1962. You know, I've seen some background on him. His father was a socialist, member of Parliament. He was forced to resign after being accused of some shady dealings. I don't know, a big scandal. He denied it all. Said he was set up. Broken man after that. Took the family to West Germany, subsequently committed suicide. Very sad. You're breaking my heart. What else you got? [SIGHS] Oh, first became involved in radical politics while studying at the Free University of Berlin. Around 1969, was trained in the Middle East by forces of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Confirmed member, Baader-Meinhof, and in 1974, after the jailing of Rudi Meinhof, he was alleged to have run a campaign of bombings, kidnappings, bank robberies. Resulted in the death of at least 20 people. Uh, suspected involvement in the 1986 La Belle Disco bombing. Weapon of choice, Heckler & Koch 70Z. Known to be extremely violent. [COMPUTER BEEPS] What, that's it? Yep. What, nothing since 86? Mm-mm. Not since your run-in at the depot. That's kind of strange. What, is he on vacation? Who's got this case? Reese. Oh, God. Pull up the surveillance list, will you, please? ANNIE: Number one. Merle Shine. Also known as The Monkey. He does look like a monkey, doesn't he? Confirmed associations with Josef Szabo. Convicted on 14 counts of forgery and embezzlement, served two years federal corrections, released 1983. Currently under investigation for receiving stolen property. Owns a sporting goods business. Uh, Monkey Shines. Do we have any legal paper on him? No. But we're all over him. Twenty-four-hour surveillance. Phones, men, you name it. Let me see the printout. Forget it, Jack. You talk to him, he's gonna know we're watching. Annie, I can handle it. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] DeForest. JACK: Yo. Package for you. It's been checked. It's only a videotape. [VCR WHIRRING] Kind of weird. That's Julia's house. Is that thing working now? MAN: Yes, it is. [JULIA SOBBING] Look in the camera. No! Look in the camera! DeForest, look at her. DeForest, remember the boy you killed? Remember that boy you shot in front of me? That was my son. My 16-year-old son. [WHIMPERING] Sixteen years old. Your boy's 16, isn't he? [GASPS, SOBBING] You took all that was left of my family. Now I'm gonna take yours. JULIA: No! Please. Please. [SZABO GRUNTS] JULIA: No! No! Oh! [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] Julia! Ricky! Ricky!

Hey-- Hey, call security. Call security. Hey, hey, help! Jesus. Hey, wait. Hey, come on, man. Hey. Hey! Tell me where Szabo is or I'll drop you off this building. Who's Szabo? Szabo! Where is he? I don't know any Szabo. He's got my family! I'm gonna kill you. I'll let you drop if you don't tell me where he is. He's got my kid. Where is he? I swear, I don't know anybody named Szabo. I swear to God, man! [SCREAMING] [BODY THUDS] Hey! Uh, 1225 Cortez Street. It's-- It's a gun shop. [♪♪♪] I'm looking for a man named Moustaffa. I am Moustaffa. I'm Carlos.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. You're both under arrest. Come on. Up. Up. Wait. Hold it! You're name's Magruder, right? Yeah. How do you know? I'm DeForest. Who? I'm DeForest! I'm on the job! Check my ID! It's in my back pocket! Hey, Reese, check this out. This guy's with the Bureau. What the hell are you doing here, DeForest? I could ask you the same thing. Like hell you can. We've had this place under surveillance for weeks. You got a goddamn warrant? I don't have a warrant. Then what the hell are you doing here? You just messed up months of investigation. Well, I'm real sorry to hear that. I want Szabo! [GROANING] Take this asshole! JACK: No, no! Get up! [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING] Don't let him go. Get up. Don't give me a hard time. UBI's been fairly cooperative with us, keeping us informed. And since, uh, there's no sign of the boy or the woman, they're calling it a kidnapping. Without dead bodies, that's all they can do. Thank you very much. Yes, sir. [DOOR CLOSES] What are you gonna do, Lee? [SIGHS] I'm gonna have to turn him over to Internal Affairs. I don't want to, but I have to. I just can't have agents running around destroying the work of the entire Bureau. I mean, the man was completely out of control. Especially when we were that close to-- To one of the most dangerous terrorists that ever existed. Now Szabo can resurface anyplace in the world, probably not for years. [SIGHS] Agent DeForest, this board of inquiry is ready to give its decision based on charges brought against you by your superiors. Do you have anything to say in regard to these matters? No, sir. My colleagues and I have taken into consideration what happened to your family and your 14-year service to the Bureau. In light of the fact and the mitigating circumstances, no criminal charges will be sought. However, we do feel for the good of the Bureau that a letter of resignation is appropriate. These proceedings are closed. Hello, Joe. [MURMURING] How bad was it? I'm out. What are you gonna do? Get on the elevator and go home. Oh, they shouldn't have done that. He was one of the best.

All right, Annie, give me everything the Bureau's got on this. Talk to Pitt. No. He'll bring FBI. It's a kidnapping. No! Hell, no! They'll take over the whole thing. He'll shut me out. He won't give me any information. I gotta be involved in this. Look, Annie-- Annie, you work with me. If you work with me, then I've got access to all the resources of the Bureau without the bullshit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and if I get caught, a case could be made for breach of security. I could end up in federal prison. Yeah, you could. JACK: You got a guy over here named Turbo. Who is it? Oh, he's local level. Back when our file on Szabo was active, we had our suspicions, but no real link was ever made. It was all circumstantial. Oh, yeah? Then what's this? Oh, well, yeah, that's Turbo, and this is a guy named, um, Vasquez. He's got a nickname too: El Tigre. The Tiger. Tiger. Give me a break. He was at the depot. Are you sure? We don't have anything that links him to Szabo. Oh, he was there. That was over a year ago. He was one of the guys who shot at me. Well, I guess that would leave an impression. How do I find him? Well, Vasquez is easy. He's in federal corrections over at Lancaster. We nailed him about a year ago for possession of illegal firearms, but we never linked him to Szabo either. Turbo owns a bar over on Euclid. You know, by now, Szabo could be anywhere in the world.

Maybe I should've buried him with his mother. Did you really expect him to go along with the idea of replacing your son? I thought it might be acceptable to him, yes. He was fine at first. He was scared. But I-- I never believed it would be easy. What you're trying to do is impossible. Why don't we just release him? Don't be ridiculous. Well, he can't harm us.

How the hell did he get access to this office? And what does he want with Vasquez? Someone just knocked off the Army weapons facility in Provo. They got 120 automatic combat shotguns. Nobody's gonna tell me these two issues aren't related. Let's go. Hollings, I feel like shit. I'm going home. What do you got, the flu? No. Female problems. [GUNSHOT] This is what you're buying. And this is what you are buying. [♪♪♪] [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] [BAG RUSTLES] The truck will meet you at the airport outside Provo at 11:00 tonight. We will do this again. Oh, yes, I'm sure. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Sir? Sir, could I have a moment? What is it? We got Vasquez. He was turned in to a local sheriff in Marion by a guy who fits DeForest's description and identified himself as an ATF agent. Well, pick him up. I wanna talk to him. Wait. After the guy leaves, Vasquez starts telling the sheriff that this guy's an impostor and that he kidnapped him. He's on his way to a house in Weaver Canyon. He gave the location. He says it's Szabo's house. Leave Delgado and Beck here. I want everybody else to follow me. I mean everybody. Let's go. Right. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [ENGINE STARTS] [DOOR OPENS] What's going on? The boy needs his medicine. Well, I'm the only one who does that. Talk to Josef. I'll take that. Talk to Josef. Let me see the dosage. I think you should go downstairs now. Let me see the dosage-- Unh! Hey! Be quiet! She interfered. What's going on? Take him downstairs. Wait-- Hey! Come on. Hey, hey. Let go of me! Come on. Trudy! What are you doing? [WHIMPERS] Since when do you question my decisions? What is it with this boy? You're becoming a problem. You're the problem. You're weak and you are scared! [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] Trudy! Stop it! Stop, or I'll break your neck. I'll snap it like a twig. You understand? [YELLS] Understand? [RICKY GRUNTS, PANTING] [SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING, MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY] [HANS CONTINUES GRUNTING] SZABO: Where's the boy? Look outside. [GROANS] [♪♪♪] [BOTH GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECHING] [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [HANS GASPS] [♪♪♪] [GUN COCKS] You must be DeForest. You were a pain in the ass. [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [♪♪♪] [GUN CLATTERS ON FLOOR] [INHALES DEEPLY] JACK: Never thought I'd see you carrying a weapon. Yeah, neither did I. You get out to the range much with that? [GROANING] Shit. [♪♪♪] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Good morning, Mr. Pitt. PITT: Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Pitt. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Pitt. Good morning. WOMAN: Good morning, Mr. Pitt. Good morning. Morning. Mornin'. Good morning, Mr. Pitt. Morning. Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] [INTERCOM BUZZES] Yes, sir. PITT: Send DeForest in. I'm glad you could make it in this morning. No problem. How's your boy? Well, he's doing much better. He's getting stronger every day. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you. I asked you to come in because I wanted to talk to you personally. The Gutierrez arraignment went better than we expected. I mean, he's being held without bail and we recovered the weapons at the airport. Yes, sir. When you were with the Bureau, we had our differences. I'm a book man, and I still believe that. However, what you've done cannot be discounted. A little bit wild, a little crazy, but, uh, you're an effective agent. And you produce results. I'm making a request to Washington to have you reinstated. What do you think about that? Washington's not gonna make that easy on you. Look, don't remind me. But, uh... what's your answer? My answer is I appreciate it. I'll keep you informed. See you tonight? See you tonight.
