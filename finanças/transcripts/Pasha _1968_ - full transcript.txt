Hero of 39-40, agent for the Resistance, Liberation fighter... Albert Gouvion has always been on the front line. Albert Gouvion has always served France. But more than the patriot, more than the crack policeman, it is the friend we are mourning today. There's no need to mourn really. Albert's just coming back 10 ST Denis. After a long pointless campaign. He can rest his bones, weary from all his antics, here at home, by the Seine. Before the concrete came, this was where we'd watch the boats. We'd pretend barges were bound for Shanghai or the Golden Gate bridge. Albert must have continued to believe in this and that. Maybe that's why he died. That and his wild fancies. Everyone talks about heart attacks, cirrhosis, The worst illness there is is giving all your love to one woman. But I'd better begin at the beginning. This is how it started. I warn you, this is a priceless collection. The insurance decides on a figure. But replacing stones of this quality would be nigh on impossible. You're taking them to Amsterdam? No. We stop at the Belgian border. I'm glad to see the back of them. Five nights on duty. We'll be off then. Take it easy. We've plenty of time. Round you go. I'll drive. - Have a safe trip. Put your seat-belt on. They've just set off. Good luck. Ready. - They're here. - Let's go. Stop. Get out. That's wide enough. See you later. Don't worry, we'll tidy up. You lost two outriders. It's fortunate, in my opinion. You can use them to cover up the others' cowardice. You know what else I think? Your men weren't up to it. Such inefficiency could be seen as connivance. I shall say as much in my statement to the press. Getting told off by a prick like that. 1 ignored him. I didn't want to aggravate the situation. Only a handful of men are capable of a job like that. Emile the Genoese, Kodréanis, Marcel Lurat, the Stéephanois, Vincent Angelotti... I want to know their movements. Now Albert. Why did he drive off the road? Who knows. We have to find out. I think he was scared. Scared. I doubt that. Poor reflexes, maybe, he's a poor driver. But I'd be surprised if he was scared. Getting shot at by a bazooka surprises you too. Only three fences are able to handle such a big job. Sammy Karakatjian. He's been in hospital for a week. Prostate. Marcel Courgue, cruising in the Caribbean. And... Leon Brunet... Just left for Rome on the 1.15 flight. We'll set Interpol on him. - Well? - We're rounding up suspects. Get on with it. I was nervous. You saw a hedgehog crossing? I saw me and the boy Marc decapitated by their thing. I know what those things can do. I saw them in "39. I could say where. Me too. In your tank in the Ardennes, I know all that. I'm not criticising your tank driving just your car driving. I was alarmed. Afraid. I was afraid if you must know. Is that what you wanted? - I'm not rejoicing. - You are. You've waited ages for this. Waiting for me to pull out. I've been taking hits for 20 years. Why not recite me your Fearless Freddie comic. When we collared Joe Bigfeet, you scored. We both owe Joe. You promotion and me six months in hospital. This morning I saw a posthumous medal coming. That really made you nervous. I only saw you back down once, at youth club. That chap pulled you out and you didn't move. I was having it away with his sister. You had a reason. Maybe you had one today. Don't you think you're pushing it? Where's this leading? I'm asking you. If it's an interrogation, have sandwiches sent up. What are you thinking? When they put fools in orbit, you'll be spinning for ever. Intercept Leon Brunet and ascertain travel motive. Leave the gate open. It's pay-day. Jackpot of the century. Four winners I don't believe it. Just look at it. Why are you here? Problems? Boucheron doesn't suspect a thing. You're not alone? My wife's next door. But she won't say anything. I'm sure. Bring some coffee through. You're mad. No. Nestor is beaten. He went too soon, he lost his second place. First Mélusine, second Mort Ia loi, third Minipinson. Tiercé numbers in order: 8, 2, 11. If Nestor IV had saved his strength and not gone out so far he would have won. Timing is of the essence. You took your time. I was beginning to worry. I had to see the others first. Here, look. Wow. I'd gladly wait for you every day for this. Yes, it's me. Morning, Sir. Officer Marquet. I'm the one who called you. Well done. It happened about an hour ago. He was cleaning his gun. He must have left a round in it. Neighbours heard a gunshot. They called the concierge, but it took him a while... He was killed instantaneously. Send the gun to the lab, anyway. They won't tell us much. It's an accident. A regrettable accident. So was the death of Louis XVI. I don't get it. We all clean our guns now and then. At six in the morning. And with twenty years service doesn't leave a round in the chamber. I don't believe it. Albert wouldn't have committed suicide over something stupid. Who mentioned suicide? So we put everyone on it? On what. Do we haul everyone in, interrogate villains who'll produce alibis confirmed by every clown in Pigalle? This time they've fired one shot too many. Albert was a funny old cove, though. He was no great shakes as a childhood friend. He was a constant pain. It started off at school. He was ashamed of his boots. I had to lend him some. Then it was algebra. "I don't get it,” he'd say. Sol did them for him. That fool always had problems. Worse and worse ones. But what can you do? He was my friend. Stay on him, two. - Have you seen Quinquin? - I don't know any Quinquin. It's urgent. We need the last known address of Jacques Vittoret, nicknamed "the Stéphanois"”. Marcel? I'm calling about Gouvion's death. We need information about Angelotti. We're following every lead. I need to know his new address, how he lives, everything. Quickly. Jacques Vittoret, "the Stéephanois”, in hospital following road accident. Kodréanis is in London. He was in a poker game that lasted 36 hours. It was in the papers. Angelotti has gone to Corsica. Married, owns a house... Look like he's retired. Emile the Genoese follows a strict rhythm. He plays guitar all the time. Recording studio by day. The Blue Note by night. He must get cramp now and then. Find out. I might have something interesting. Yesterday, Marcel Lurat played poker at the Korean's. Let's take a look. When a copper gets killed suddenly all the villains play poker. The Korean's on the right. After the dogs' cemetery and the gasworks. This really is a rotten area. - Thanks a lot. - Why? I was born here. Albert too. It's true, it has changed. - You think that's it? - I'm certain. In that shop there they'd sell liquorice sticks and lucky dips. They were cornets with coloured paper. Let's go, then. We're honoured. Better yet, I brought my chief constable. Nice of you to drop in. Usually I get summoned. They tell us we have to be more friendly. Looking for someone? Who? Quinquin. The who was playing poker the night one of my mates shot himself cleaning his gun. When did he leave the table”? He didn't. Will you tell the judge that? Under oath. Right. Come on. We'll talk in here because of the noise. What noise? The noise we'll make. Excuse us. The hall is hired for the night. - Who by? - The policeman's ball. On your bikes. It's a private party. - What about my dinner? - Eat it tomorrow. - Get out. - Leave me alone. I've not finished. It's the first time I've seen that. Maybe you never will again. Or anything, for that matter. It depends. Well, do we have to carry you? Who was at this poker game? Me, little Joe from Nanterre... Lucky André and Freddie the Mexican. I get the picture. Listen to this. If one of us kills the other you'd get put away, I'd get a medal. Unfair, but that's how it is. You've got forty years service against you. So choose. Who was at the poker game? My respects, Sir. That's not why I sent for you. Sit down. What about the jewels? We're verifying alibis. And exposing some of them. We found one at Marmottan. Doesn't even remember his name. Do. Abdel Shmil, alias the Korean. Did he talk? Yes. But others won't be telling any tales. Lyon Léon, Arsene "the locksmith", Hamburg Hortz... We're losing lots of customers. Must be a bad year. Another report... more confidential. You seem to have managed to keep the press from talking about Léon's death. The fellow who got rid of him didn't advertise it either. I believe all these deaths are connected. You be the judge of that. Now let's tackle a less happy subject. That's why I sent for you, really. Albert's death. It's slow progress. I'd prefer progress to be fast. Look, Louis, just between us... I don't want Albert's killer to escape. Trust me. Nobody's going to escape. Telex No. 34,523 from the Paris police, to prefectures throughout France. Copy to Interpol. Concerns Boucheron case. Seek urgently Marcel Lurat, alias "Quinquin”. Suspected of murder. Pass on all recent intelligence. If spotted, discreet surveillance. Signed, Chief Constable Joss. Begging now? Don't joke. It's for Albert's wreath. Poor Albert. For once he's going home instead of squatting with that girl. Who? Nathalie. That's right. Right, back to business. - We've got witnesses. - 1 don't know the Stéeéphanois. Start again. It's stabilised now. Switch off the lights. The picture's good. Did you know Albert knew someone called Nathalie? Well, I knew more or less. Unofficially. What do you mean? I think her name's Villar or Vimar, something like that. She works in a cabaret club called the "Hippies". Albert mentioned her once or twice. - Not to you? - No, not to me. Miss Nathalie Villar, please. Over there. Chief Constable Joss. You don't know me but I know you. I tried to reach you in Rome. Indeed. Business trip? I was asked the same question, but less courteously. And I was searched. Might I ask the reason for all this interest? Probably just curiosity. You've been spending 10,000 a week for years. People wonder where it comes from. Petty, I know, but the police have always been petty. I do hope you'll tell me, though. No doubt. Count on it. That's right. Chief Constable Joss. Could I talk to you for a moment? What about? Albert Gouvion. Poor Albert. We could have dinner together. I finish in 15 minutes. Fine, I'll wait for you. Sorry, I completely forgot. We're expected at the Calavados. Do you mind not being alone? Not at all. Come along, then. A friend of Albert. - Poor Albert. = It came as a shock. I only know what was in the papers. - How did the accident happen? - It wasn't an accident. What's your job? Policeman. - And you're a barmaid? - Depends on when. Really? You like her? Who? She seems nice. We'll start with champagne. Unless Uncle Antoine prefers white or rosé. No. Champagne will be fine. I'll have a scotch. Champagne makes me dizzy. - It's wonderful. - I am starving. We already ordered. Is caviare alright? That's what I'd have ordered. I wonder if we share the same tastes in everything. And to follow, poached lobster. Great. Shall I butter some toast? With pleasure. Did they butter Albert's toast? No, I did. He was your friend. Did you know him well? I thought so. Listen, he knows some great jokes. You know the one about the rabbi at the Vatican? - I'll tell it anyway. - Yes, go on. It was easy at first. We'd see each other now and then. But no one died of it. Then he gradually became jealous. He'd drop in at 8 in the morning to see if I was alone. Then he began bringing his things and moving in. “I don't want you to work. We'll live together.” When I asked what with, he'd say, "I'll manage.” Did he commit suicide because he couldn't? He didn't, he was rubbed out. And St Peter said, "Amen." What are you doing in Paris? We have a good time in Bordeaux. I was tired of their jokes. Me too. Shall I drop you off? No, I'll drop you off. Basically Albert was a fool like any other. - He was nice. - Yes, but still a fool. The kind of man who wanted to break everything but never did. The kind who asked questions, especially in bed. I know something about that. Why do we love each other? Why don't we? Why do we drink? Why haven't we been awarded the Legion of Honour? You know Brunet? He's different. He's there every night. He phones for an hour every morning. There should be clinics for obsessives. There were. We closed them. You didn't eat a thing. - I've some ham and eggs. - No, thanks. I have to sleep. - You alarmed me. - We called but no one answered. - What do you want? - You know Ernest Litcher? - Ernie the Hat? = The same. Guess what he was caught stealing? Guessing games at this time. Go on. Postmen's uniforms. He mentioned Olivier Brunet. Interested? Got your car? Come on. Answer. It's worse than a crime. I could go down for three years. Sounds about right. Why did you steel the uniforms? You'd better own up. We're listening. Relax. Tell us about it. You don't seem too well. Neither do I. I've just had a look at your file. Five years for the Rue de Douai and five more for the Rungis shoot-out. Now you thump a watchman to nick clothes from the State. Not very clever. There's something I don't get. What's Brunet got to do with all this? - Brunet? - Yes. You mentioned him, Just in passing, maybe. I don't really remember. Take your time. Think about it. And other stuff too, because with your form you're facing relegation. You'll be out in time for the old folks' home. You could always tell them your life story, but still... It's no way to end your life. Stop it. The main thing is to face the judge like a man, head high. You never know what'll happen afterwards. I want to talk to you. That's why we're here. Yes, but... man to man. If you wouldn't mind, gentlemen... Ernest is rather shy. Go ahead, I'm listening. I've been invited to go on a luxury cruise. 25 grand to escort a postal van. So we need the suits. Brunet's the fence? Yes... together with Emile. Which Emile? I know 25. The Genoese. Well, well. They can afford it. This will make them two billion... Like you said, you've moved up in the world. Alfred. Come through. Let's get down to detail. Where, when and how? I don't know where. Nor when. But it concerns a transfer from Swiss banks to the French National Bank. Half in dollars, half in marks. Ernest is leaving. Give him his tie and laces. And the clothes he stole. He has a delivery to make and 48 hours in which to do it. That's not long. It's enough. And if nothing comes of your trip I've another ticket for you. Wrap the uniforms for the gentleman. Busy night? Any news on the Genoese? Still into music. Why? We'll go and give him the beat. Come on. I thought you'd destroyed Quinquin's alibi? Isn't that enough? Emile's a quiet chap. I know. It's a quiet kind of world. The villains quietly shoot each other. And your pal Emile quietly holds up a postal train. I'm sick up to here with your quiet men. Listen to the organ It's playing for you The tune is awful, it's true Hope you like it Sounds kinda cool It's a requiem For a fool I composed it especially for you You were a villain through and through On your pasty face And on the prison wall I'll carve your disgrace Poor fool. That's great, Serge. Still playing, Emile? I spend half my life doing this. We're not interested in that half. What do you want? - Not to talk records. - The Boucheron hold-up. Funny, I get fingered for all the top jobs. You're a star in your way Where were you on the 10th? The jewels van was held up in the daytime. Sergeant Gouvion was killed at night. You can't hang that one on me. If there's a cap lying around, we have to find a head to fit it. I don't want to curb your enthusiasm... but if you're talking about caps, leave Gouvion out of it. What do you mean? I like a tidy world. With villains on one side and coppers on the other. With your friend, we weren't sure what side he was on. Hanging around us, he ended up making friends. Family, if you will. Have you heard of Lyon Leon? Vaguely. Didn't you know Gouvion went with his sister? No, but I'm here to learn. And you may scoff But what is there about it That turns you off? To me it's all the same, whether it's kind or cruel I'll sing it once again Poor fool. Come in, I'm in here. Look... We talked about Albert but not Léon. Leon? Which Leon? Lyon Léon. Forgotten your little brother? They called him that after he held up the Crédit Lyonnais. The start of a brilliant career. Just a matter of direction. If we didn't bring food home we'd watch the others eat. It shapes the character. The Villar family went to borstal when we were eighteen. As others would go to the seminary. Let me tell you a secret from my youth. Albert always chose his bedfellows poorly. Ten times I've rescued him from a mess. I thought he'd slowed down at sixty. I was wrong. He met a bitch like you who led him on. Don't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything. Albert had debts all over. Seeing this, it's not surprising. I never asked for a thing. He couldn't help it. He always wanted... To look the part. Yes. I think it was that. He bought me lots of things to look rich. He got into big card games to look tough. One day he even hit me, so he'd look like a man. He even adopted your way of speaking. And he ended up looking like what he was: a down on his luck. So he began closing his eyes to a good many fiddles and then by doing favours. - For Leon? I'm not mentioning any names. My brother's not in trouble. He called today. He wants to meet. I don't know where he is. At the morgue. They found him in his car. He'd been shot. Who by? Quinquin. He killed Albert. I don't care about Albert. Like 1 don't care about Leon. Don't you think we've a reason to stitch him up, our friend Quinquin? It wasn't your brother who phoned. It was Quinquin, wasn't it? Why do you think? To kill you. When he calls back, I'll tell you where to set up a meeting and you'll go. And get killed. No, offer him a two billion-franc job. Will he listen? When money talks loud enough, everyone listens. Marcel. On your own? Is Leon late? Your brother's becoming unbearable. That's why I wanted to see you. I'm furious. So am I. I've not heard a word. It's like he was dead. He's not even come for his money. It's odd. I thought he'd be here. Why go to this trouble? So you'd come. I've an urge to travel. The South Sea Islands, Bora Bora... Ever been there? Will you take me? You don't take sausages to Frankfurt. You could say "flowers to Holland". Anyway, I'm weighing anchor. But not with the stash. I've 80 grand I don't need. Where can I leave it? On you? Don't be stupid. I rented a house in St Germain. Shall we drop in? I'll give it you and head off. It's goodwill week. You offer me 80 grand. I'm offering twenty times that. Shame we have to grow up. I used to like fairy tales. I'm serious, Marcel. Before your ironmongery robbery, Leon was on a job. A real one. It's a solid gold job. Everything's sorted but Léon's on the run. I haven't got the muscle to rob a train. I thought Emile would help me. I know plenty of Emiles. - The Genoese. - He hasn't got the bottle. That's what I figured. Nice of you to think of me but I only work when I need to. And I'm not in the market for now. Before we get back to business, how much is involved in your little scheme? Two billion. You were right. Mention money and their brains stop working. But why didn't you arrest him? I don't get it. Because he'd be tried. With ten killings to his name, his lawyer would plead for committal. They'd send him to an asylum, he'd escape and start again. And I don't want that. You could have said what floor. I've tried three already. I didn't expect any thanks... So what news on the theft? I told you, a train robbery. The English influence. You'll be buying masks at Old England next. When is it? Monday 19th. The money is loaded at Basle. The train stops at Chaumont for three minutes. Emile and his boys, disguised as postmen, jump in the wagon. The train sets off. They put the real postmen to sleep. Second stop, two minutes at Troyes. They take the dough, the train leaves. But Emile carries on by road and takes the money to Brunet, who's waiting at Boulay sugar plant. I wouldn't do this for anyone but you. Let's get one thing straight, Ernest. You need me, I need you, so we deal. A robber turned grass. You don't expect me to kiss you. Go on. Got a pencil and paper? Take this down. The postal van leaves Troyes station around 4.30 pm. It sets off in the direction of St Florentin on the Nationale 77. Brunet will be waiting at the Boulay sugar refinery to make the trade. You see? When Quinquin calls, throw him that one. Have you any family outside of Paris? Yes. A cousin in Romorantin. Go and see her and come back on Monday night, not before. Understand? Remember your brother. You see? I'd prefer to hear it from your own mouth. Where do we meet up? Is it hard for you to drop by? No, I've a car. Go to St Germain... I'll write it down. Saint-Germain turn-off. - Take the third on the left. = Third on the left. About 200 metres on, he road forks... Road forks after 200 metres. There's a woodland path. You'll see a gardener's house with a greenhouse. Don't worry, I'll find it. See you later. There's only one road from Troyes to St Florentin. That's the Nationale 77. The money will be there. You can't miss it. I never miss. Yes, I know. Like a drink? If you like. She was a good girl. She liked Albert. He was going to marry her. What's eating you? Nathalie Villar. Léon Villar, alias Lyon Léon. Same family... So what? - That's what's eating me. - That's a policeman talking. She hardly saw her brother. And Albert was straight. Is that your version? I'd rather like it to be ours. There's no love letters so I read the telegrams. Eleven dead. The same killer, you reckon. Quinquin? You have proof? Bring him in, and he'll be out the next day. Not if I send him where he sent Albert. Listen... I'm fed up with villains, I've had forty years of them. I've swallowed their nonsense every which way. They Kill, but society and women like that. They think it's romantic, I don't. I've taken a decision. I'm not sending them for trial any more. No more technicalities or remissions. I'm going to throw a St Valentine's Day party. See what I mean? You want me to cover you? No, I don't much care. I'll have finished in six months. You've prepared the speeches and the cakes. What can happen? They'll take away my cake? You're simplifying somewhat. Let's simplify then. I need ten men, Paul. - When for? - Monday. And Monday is wash day. How's Blanche, anyway? The invitation for dinner stands. I warn you, it'll be alarming. So listen carefully. Monday at 11.36, two billion in foreign currency leaves Basle station. You Will be escorts. Here are your postal uniforms. Put padding in your hats. At the first stop Emile the Genoese and his men will jump you. Understand? At 3.23 the train will stop at Chaumont station. We get on. Chaumont. This is Troyes. Troyes. You wait at the station with the cars. That's the Nationale 77 leading to the sugar refinery. Brunet is waiting to change the dollars for real money. Everyone understand? If you get lost, don't ask a peasant for directions. On the way to the meeting with Brunet, the Genoese will think he sees Quinquin. And it'll be him. They'll start shooting right away. The winner will get to the meeting and fall upon our archers. If all goes well, it'll be as famous as Azincourt. Don't look at me like that. It's not my fault you're here. This is all down to your boss, the chief constable. As you should be real postmen and get hit on the head, why not have a little drink. Might as well. As we're going to get hit... Exactly. There. I like watching you. You really are a swine. Here's the mail. Regional check. Regional check... What's that mean? Let's go. Help us move it. I prefer a good alibi. We received orders from Paris about an attack. This is the new security itinerary. Part by rail, the rest by road. That's why all your lorries are parked outside my station. - I did wonder. - There you go. What's happening? I'll open it for you. Well, at least the mail won't be late. Drop it, or I shoot. Surrender. You're surrounded. See, it's harder to take it than to dish it out. You never thought of that. Why did you shoot me? That was from Albert Gouvion. "Old boots Albert”, "the terror of the Ardennes”, "the ladykiller”. My friend... the king of fools.
