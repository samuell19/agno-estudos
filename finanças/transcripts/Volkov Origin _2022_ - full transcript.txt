(brooding music) (gate slams) (ominous music) Coop! Don't fucking move. You're fucking moving. Put your hands up. Keep your fucking hands up. Motherfuckers can't hear nowadays. Your shirt. (chain rattling) Damn, hurry up. You can go faster than that. Damn, tick-tock, motherfucker. Come on. Are you finished? You done? Welcome to Hotel Horton House. Hey, now. We hope you enjoy your stay. Piece of work, like always, Coop. Hey, kid. Do yourself a favor, all right, keep to yourself, 'cause it's first night is always the hardest, all right? It's always the hardest, and this whole entire lot is gonna do anything it can to get to you. Don't let 'em. All right? (soft music) (gate slams) (soft music continues) (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) Hello? Yeah, Angela. Um, Dr. Perkins, I'm sorry. This is Bill Nash. I'm the resident physician at Horton House Penitentiary. I'm very sorry to call so late, but I've had something come across my desk that I think really fits your criteria. It's after midnight. I know, and I apologize again, but, um, Doctor, does the name Andre Volkov mean anything to you? No, I'm sorry. Andre Volkov? No, that doesn't. Never heard of him. Andre Volkov was committed to the juvenile justice system a few years ago on a charge of murder. He was 14 at the time. He just turned 18, and as of this morning, he's been transferred to Horton House. I've been looking over his file and I can tell you right now this young man is gonna need some extra attention. In my professional opinion, he's a psychiatric goldmine. That's what I'm calling you. My main concern is that, if he doesn't get the proper care, he's gonna get lost in the system permanently. I'll be honest with you, Doctor, my job here is just sewing up cuts after fights. I don't really do psychiatric evaluations. I suppose I can look over his file. Quick question, Dr. Nash. Do you know when I'll be able to see him? Well, he just arrived this morning, so there's a period of adjustment. Call it 60 days. Thank you, Dr. Nash. If you could just do me a favor in the morning, can you fax everything over to me? I promise I'll review the paperwork over the next few weeks, prepare a case for him on my end. So I'll see you in a couple of months. Is that all right? Sounds great. You have a good evening, Dr. Perkins. Thank you. Have a good night. [Andre] Time on the outside moves different than on the inside. Being incarcerated, time stands still, especially as a child. This day marks the beginning, the start of your greatest challenge. Looking back, we were so young. You never knew I would become your greatest accomplishment. Well, this is it. Little early, ma'am, so we'll bring him in in a few minutes. Okay, good. Will give me time to set things up a bit. And by the way, thank you so much for the tour before. It was very interesting - Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure. Be right back. (brooding music) Stop, hands on the table. Sit. Behave yourself, son. The hold is no place for someone your age. Officer Torres and I will be right out front if you need us. Also, we'll be watching from above. Thank you. Good morning, Andre. My name is Dr. Perkins, and I'm going to be spending a great deal of time with you, trying to understand why and how you got here. I've been reviewing your file, and I see there's been a great deal of turmoil in your life. Do you mind if we discuss some of those things today? I can tell there are many things troubling you, aren't there? I mean, what kind of father blinds a little boy with boiling water? Oh God. That's sick. Freaking monster. Sorry. You know, Andre, I really want to understand, especially from your perspective. And as you know, these reports can be very one-sided, and honestly, the only side I want to hear is yours. Can you talk to me, Andre? Andre, are you listening to me? Andre, you've been through so much. I can't even begin to imagine how scared and angry you must have been witnessing your father murdering your beloved mother. And now, this boy, this boy in the file, who lashed out uncontrollably in the middle of the greatest trauma imaginable is branded a danger when he's the victim. How does that make you feel? Andre, you really got to open up to me. I have a feeling there aren't too many people racing to be on your side. Let's not talk about that. Let's move on to something else. Yes, I'm very curious to hear about your relationship with Father O'Malley. - Stop! Andre. It's okay. It's okay. Here, let me give you something for your eyes. Can I help with your eyes? Do you mind? I can do it myself. Okay. It's right here. I don't see why not. Take your time. It's okay. Andre. Are you ready? Yes. Good. Let's go back to the very beginning, shall we? (crickets chirping) (melancholy music) [Andre] It felt as if I had been walking for days. The hard concrete beneath my feet. The smell of wildflowers and the chirping of crickets took my mind off the horror I just experienced. I can still all the whiskey on your breath. I can hear the rage in your voice. I had nowhere to hide. Mother. I'm sorry. I wish I had done more to protect you. Evil comes in many forms. That day, evil was my father. She was so caring. She was my life. (kettle whistling) You took everything from me. You boiled the windows to my soul. Because of you, I live in a world of darkness. So much anger, fear, and panic filled the air around me. My hands, sore and stained with the earth. You made me bury my own mother. My only friend, my eyes on the world. And on this day, by my hands, you feel my pain. Over and over and over. I now know anger. I now know death. For I have seen evil. (laid-back music) ♪ I like it here (indistinct) ♪ ♪ The scurrying of small animals ♪ ♪ The rustle and the bustle of the wind ♪ ♪ Autumn's leaves are jangly dancing ♪ ♪ September skips a modest breeze ♪ Young man. Are you okay? What you doing out here all alone? I know you, right? What are your parents? Listen, my brother and I, we've got an orphanage we run nearby. Why don't we get you some water, some food, some rest? You can be reunited with your family there. You'll be safe at the orphanage. Your salvation's at hand. [Andre] Father O'Malley talked a lot on our journey. Maybe it was to fill the gap, because I said nothing, nor did I really listen to him. After all, what was there to say? At an age when other children were playing ball in the street, I had already murdered my father. Father Seamus, children, come downstairs, please. Declan's here with a child. (Seamus sighs) Brought me another stray, have you, Declan? That's no way to talk about a child of the Lord. Found him wandering alone, like a lamb cleaved from the flock. And I'm supposed to believe that this particular lamb you met through sheer happenstance? Ah, happenstance, God's will, karma, call it what you will. The boy needs our help, as you can clearly see. When have we turned away a child in need? Well, it seems to be in both your favors that attendance is light right now. Get the boy cleaned up. Then get him in with the other children for prayer and a meal. And then find his parents immediately. Feed the body and the soul. Perfect. Might I suggest you do the same, brother? See me in my office as soon as the boys are fed. Say hello, boys. Hello. All right, all right. Break it. Come on now. Come on. Give him a change of clothes, Declan. Sister, Margaret. What are these boys just doing standing around here? Telling me you've done all your Bible studies? Your homework? Your chores? Come on, find an occupation. Let's go. Let's go, boys. Have a lovely morning, Sister. You too, Father. For God's sake. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) Well, do they have any leads? No, no, no, the boy is here with us now. Appears to be traumatized, yeah. We found him wandering the roads. No. No, that's, it's not necessary, Sheriff. I mean... No, the boy is in good hands with us here. I appreciate it. Sheriff, we have ways of protecting ourselves, all right? Thank you. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Good day. They're dead. Who? The parents. The father. The mother. Dear Lord. It was a brutal, bloody scene. It's a miracle the boy escaped. Are you happy? Are you serious? Deadly serious. Well, you've really stepped in it this time with your bleeding heart. This child is your responsibility now. All of these children are my responsibility. Have I not served penance enough for ya? Now, now we're all in the shadow of the sinful. All of us. Only God can judge when your penance is finished. Not you, not me. Only God. Would you like to take confession, Seamus? Go to hell, Declan. Already there, brother. Already there. Hello, Andre. Sister Margaret tells me that, uh, you haven't spoken or eaten, so, uh, I thought, instead of going down to the dining hall, I'd bring a little something special up to you here, huh? Andre. I've known of you for a long time. Of your entire family. I mean, it's a small town, you know, and, well, your mother, your mother was known to the church. She was quite devout, you know. As good a soul as I've ever known, actually. I am so sorry for your loss, dear child. And I am so terribly sorry for the horrors that you personally have been through. No, no, it's all right. I understand. No, no, I understand. Trust is hard right now. Just know this, Andre. From here on, this is your home. I mean, not this room in particular, but this entire orphanage. All right, you know? And tomorrow, we'll begin the process of healing. You'll sleep with the other children, you know. You'll down in the dining hall with everyone and you'll make friends and occupations. Life. As hard as it is to believe right now, dear child, life does go on. God has seen fit to throw us together, whether we're ready for it or not. And it is up to us to decide whether we will allow ourselves to be devoured by evil or fight against it. You have lived in the darkness for far too long. Tomorrow, tomorrow we search for the light. Your mother was the light, dear child. Don't let it die with her. [Andre] The hammer was a representation of my soul. Andre, time for lunch! [Andre] I knew I had to hide my soul swift and quickly. Hey. My name's Jimmy. What's your name? He can't hear you. He's blind. Hey, stop picking on him! - Boys. - Maybe I'll pick on you instead. - Right. Quiet down, children. Quiet down. Good morning, children. - Good morning, Father. - Morning, Father O'Malley. Well, that was not very impressive, now was it? Has the Lord not provided you with a lovely repast this morning? I say let's try again. What do you say, Sister? Let's try that again. [Boys] Good morning, Father O'Malley. Marginally better. All right, well, we've a very special morning here today. Our family here at the Big House has grown by one, and I'd love to introduce each and every one of you here to our newest member of the flock, Andre Volkov. Welcome to the Big House. Our happy, happy home. Heartfelt. All right. Jimmy. Jimmy, what is that? Hey! The Lone Ranger and Tonto. What have I told you about having that? Hey, come on. Well, that is adorable. Very nice, very nice. All right. As your boys can see, Andre is a special needs child, and he's gonna need a little extra help here around the house. You know, just finding his way and settling in. I'm gonna need a volunteer, one of you, who can be his guide. He's the Lone Ranger, and I can be his Tonto. All right, Jimmy. Well done, laddie. You can keep that. So, welcome, Andre. Let's make him all feel at home, shall we? So if you'll excuse me, Father Declan and I have a little work to do. Sister, let's get them through their paces, shall we? Yes, Father. Let's clear the table, boys, and then we can get to your other chores. You know, that name of yours is real stupid. I think after breakfast I'm gonna give the blind boy a proper- - His name is Andre. I don't give a damn what his name is. You know, if you're so intent on being his friend, I think I'll extend the invitation to you as well. You better watch your back. Well, I guess you can't. Let's go, boys. Your other chores are waiting. (scoffs) Sister Margaret, Declan, well, you don't seriously mean to tell me that, that this boy was given a whooping by Andre, who cannot see, or Jimmy, who doesn't have a vicious bone in his body? That's what seems to have happened. Seems to be? Peter has a pretty nasty cut on his head. Huh. Well, I don't suppose the two of you had the common sense to interview the boys separately before they were able to concoct this story? This isn't the Spanish Inquisition, Seamus. They're children. Yeah, children who come to us burdened by their past. Each one of them have a hard background. Aren't you the one who's consistently reminding me of that, Declan. These boys, without exception, have had a hard life. But I have to say, if Jimmy and Andre, while being traumatized enough, I don't find it hard to believe. But Peter, who may have found it a wee bit of fun to have trouble with a blind boy. Well, if they stood up for themselves, well, I'm not gonna punish them for it. A punishment? Atonement? Oh, you're one to speak, Seamus, all right? You run off to the church, leaving me with your parents in the old country. I'm, answerable to God, not you, Declan. I am not now, and you have not been appointed your brother's keeper. Not now, not ever. I am still the elder in this relationship, and I'm the head of this household, and you would be well to remember that, by God. I am not an unreasonable man, boyos. I'm not. I understand, and I have no doubt that this incident may have shaken you up a wee bit. So I'll say that the damage to your pride and to your head, Peter, may be more than enough for right now. I might. However, I've gotten together with Sister Margaret, and we have devised a very long, painful, and slow session of Bible study for each one of you, on top of your extra efforts. Why am I getting punished? It was Peter! Shut up. Well, you need to consider this. Choices have consequences. And you gotta ask yourself this question: is the price for your choice more than you are willing to pay? It's a very harsh world that we live in, boyos, and it doesn't take a lot extra to be kind to those around ya. I think we need to find ways to help each other. Agreed? Agreed? Andre may be blind, boyos, but I, Sister Margaret, and God most assuredly are not. We'll be keeping our eyes on you. Dismissed? For now. Get the hell out of here. Go. (Seamus sighs) Oh, Andre. What are we to do with you, boy? (crickets chirping) God. Why punish him when it's me who sinned? Maybe you've had enough, Seamus. (scoffs) Oh, there's not enough whiskey in the world to make me forget what's happened here, Declan. Have you read the report? Have you seen the torture this boy has gone through? I mean, the amount of agony and pain that he's gone through now being transferred to every soul his life has touched, and I'm to blame. Ah, you couldn't have known. Oh, I know. I knew I was poisoned from the moment I left you and the family and the parents back in Cork. I ran. I ran as far as I could. Oh, Declan, you should a let me go. You should a let me go, but God will chase a sinner to perdition and back. Even the devil will. Maybe we should pray on this together, brother. To hell with that. I need to atone. I need to confess. I need to come clean. You need to sleep. You need to sober up. You're no good to anyone like this. I never have been. You were the good one. Hmm. Oh, cheers to that. You were the good one. Mm. The pride, the pride of clan O'Malley. The good child. The protector. You were first. I only ever followed you. Well, I killed that, Seamus, didn't I? There's no amount of confession that'll ever put things right again. Bring in the boy. No. Oh, God sake, Declan. Just bring him in. You know I need to atone. You're the one who's told me I have to do that. Let's get this thing right. I have concerns for the boy. (sighs) That's why he has to know. He needs to know. I need to tell him it's not his fault. No, no, it's me. I'm the one who's doomed. No, no, Declan, he can still be saved. Sleep on this, Seamus, I beg you. I've been sleeping my entire life. No, I'm wide awake now. I need to do this while I can. I beg of you. I pray of you. Oh, Declan. Send in the boy. Alone. Fine. But you won't be needing any of this. (scoffs) No, it's okay. I'm numb already. I've got everything I need right here on the desk. I'm locked and loaded with the Lord. This is a volatile situation. Be gentle. Of course. Of course. (melancholy music) Even if it kills me. Yeah, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death. [Seamus] Good night, wee lad. Hello, Andre. It's been quite the week we've had here, hasn't it? Hey, do you mind if I tell you story? Is it all right? All right. Yes, let's start with a beautiful woman, but trouble, you understand? Oh. And where do the troubled and lost sheep go when they're having difficulties? Andre, they go to our dear Holy Mother Church. And that's what she did. And she met an impressionable young priest. You know, he did everything he could to possibly help her, Andre. He... You know, it's not her fault. It's not her fault. I mean, when someone is kind to you after you've dealt with so much pain in your life, well, Andre, it's natural to develop feelings, is it not, Andre? Yeah. The only problem is, he began to develop feelings himself. He broke his vows. He broke his vows to himself, to his family, to his church, to his God. But Andre, Andre, Andre, he loved her. Andre, this man, this man would've left. He would've gone with her. He wanted to go with her. But the church, oh, they wouldn't have it, no. "Scandal!", they cried. "Scandal!" And they moved him, they moved him far away where he could do nothing more for her. He was gone, Andre. He was gone, but, oh, oh, she followed, Andre. She followed him. He was at a new church, but she, she moved to an area nearby. She moved to an area nearby, Andre, and he didn't know until she showed up on the other side of the confessional team to him. - Who? - And she told him. That's when she told him, she said, she told him that he was the... You gotta understand, she was pregnant, Andre. Andre, she was with child, and he found out then that he was the father. He reacted in horror, but he did not know. And she told him. He said, "It's all right, it's all right." And she gave, she wanted to give something to him. Andre, Andre, Andre, a chain, Andre. She had a silver chain. And on this silver chain was a tooth. He found out later that it was a wolf's tooth, Andre. But... No, no, no, no, no. This, this, this belongs to you. Son, this belongs to you, you see? Who is the priest? It's your birthright. It's your birthright. It's an heirloom. It's what she wanted. But you know, she left so quickly. He turned and he ran from the confessional with this chain in his hand, and he looked, and all he could see is her leaving. The last he saw of her as she leaves. Oh, Andre, Andre. You? Andre, you have to understand. He had no choice. He didn't know. He didn't know! My father! Yes, Andre. Andre, I'm the priest. He sent money. He sent money. And his brother would keep an eye and watch the family, but he had no idea how bad things had gotten, Andre. He didn't know. - Father! Yes, Andre. It's me, Andre. Andre, oh, my dear boy. My dear boy, you've got to understand. It's not that we I wanted things, but you know, you know, we discovered the hammer, boy. We know. We know where you buried the hammer. We know it was you, Andre. We found the hammer that you buried. But that's okay. Andre, listen to me. No, listen to me, Andre. We'll take care of you. I'll hide it. The church is good at that. The church is good at taking care of things. We reburied the hammer. You're all gonna be all right? No! Yes, Andre. Yes, it's me. I'm your father. I am your father! - Andre, yes. - No, get off me! Andre, it's me. You killed me. I am your father. I own you, boy. Leave her alone! No, Andre, it's fine. You understand me? - No! No, I do anything to your mother. We tried to help you. - Stop hurting my mother, you bastard! - I didn't hurt your mother. It's someone else. I'm not that man. I am your father, Andre. (Andre screaming) (Andre weeping) What have you done, boy? What have you... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Hello, Andre. Happy 40th birthday. I brought you something sweet to eat. I'm sorry. They won't let me light any candles in here. Are you ready to get started? All right. So according to my notes, we lived off at the part where you murdered Father O'Malley. Your version is quite different from the police report, I must say. But I take their reports with a grain of salt anyways. And you also mentioned something about loyalty and other individuals whom you've met at Horton. There's something about the Great Exit. Can you tell me more about that? My soul's been troubled, yes. But what would I say? "Father, save me from this hour."? (laughs) One with unreliable friends soon come to ruin. Just as there are those friends that have a bond that's stronger than a brotherhood. In here, I found the ruins. In fact, I find it quite coincidental that you're here to witness this. Witness what, Andre? The true meaning of solidarity. Like wolves. A pack. What time do you have, Dr. Perkins? It's 11:43. It's almost time for lunch, Andre. Yes, feeding time. Let the wolves eat. (upbeat rock music) Home, sweet home. (indistinct) No talking, inmate. (indistinct) Hey, enter your cell. Right now. Let's go. Get the fuck on in your cell! (inmate laughs) Can you believe this motherfucker? (inmate laughs) Now! Now! Now! (alarm blaring) What on Earth is going on? It's easy to forgive the boy who's afraid of the dark. But the true tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. What are you talking about, Andre? I free myself from the prisons of my mind. I refuse to live the rest of my life in this miserable fucking place! There's no gate, there is no lock that can be set upon the freedom of my mind. Dr. Perkins, you are free as am I. (upbeat rock music) (dramatic music) Directly behind me is Horton House Penitentiary, where just yesterday several inmates escaped, injuring multiple guards, some succumbing to their injuries, while others remain hospitalized at this time. When speaking warden to determine how something like this happened, he said, quote, "All of our staff are highly trained. Something like this took a lot of time, maybe even years, to plan and carry out," unquote. Which leads to the real question: how secure are these facilities, and how safe are you living near them? These are the hard questions that many local residents would like to have answered. In the meantime, people are advised to remain in their homes and to only answer their doors to law enforcement officials. Reporting live from Horton House Penitentiary, I'm Carrie King. (dramatic music) With the recent murder of Mary Bishop, wife to federal judge, Jon Bishop, Andre Volkov and his syndicate have now made the Fugitive Recovery Agency's top-10 list. That makes them the most wanted organized crime unit in America. The FRA recently assigned this case to its top agent, Daisy Rae. Rae told News 7, "We've given state and local law enforcement agencies ample time to apprehend them. Though I think they're doing a good job, good just isn't cutting it." Mary Bishop's murder comes on the seventh year since the Horton escape. Agent Rae seems to be that fresh face the public is searching for. Let's hope Rae and her team can finally bring a peaceful end to this story. I'm Emily Park with your updates at eight. (brooding music) Today just got incredibly messy. This is why I've called you here. Wait, this has something to do with us? Brutus. Gentleman, meet Jim Shepherd. Over the years, Shepherd has been convicted by Judge Bishop on cocaine trafficking charges. This makes him the perfect guinea pig for us. We got word that our codes were to be delivered to the judge, so we hired Shepherd to intercept those codes, take out the judge, but not his wife. Instead, he took the codes and killed the wrong person. Why are we just now hearing about Shepherd? Yeah, we could've taken care of this ourselves, instead of hiring that piece of shit. He was supposed to take the fall for the judge's murder. He has motive. There also seems to be a break in the chain. Someone within our organization decided to leak our codes, and did. The less you knew, the easier it would be for us to find out who. So what now? Simple. We find Jim, get our codes back, zero his ass so he can't do any more damage. There's one more thing. Jim Shepherd has a brother. Mathew. The FRA agent? Yes. What the fuck? Enough! I want you to find Jim. I want you to return what is ours. Take him to the garage. Then I want you to find Mathew. Take him to the barn. I want you to show him what happens to people that interfere with us. I want you to show him his brother's head. We already have a lead on Jim's location. Nick Morse is an FRA informant for us. He will have all the information we need shortly. I'll make that call right now. (upbeat rock music) ♪ You still show no affection ♪ ♪ Well, I'll leave it to you ♪ ♪ Draw me out like a picture ♪ (cell phone ringing) (ominous music) I was expecting your call. Yeah, well, we just found out about this tonight. Seems like there's a lot going on that we don't know about. And I'm still trying to figure out how an FRA agent like yourself is involved in all of this. I'll tell you what. I don't know who to trust anymore. I wonder the same thing from time to time, but here I am dealing with the devil. I'm assuming he needs some info on Jim? Well, yeah, that's a good start. Seems as if your boy is trying to skip town as we speak. He's gonna be at Third Shift bar tomorrow night to meet some guy named Mario. They're gonna be a exchanging funds, and then he's ghost. Not if we have anything to do about it. Great. I'll be there looking pretty. You're not the only one who has his neck on the line. Well, listen, I got a few items to take care of. I'll make sure that my boys know where to be and when to be there. (upbeat rock music) Hit me with the good stuff. Just leave the bottle. I got the money. Now I need you to come through for me. You owe me. I owe you nothing. Brother, you're the one who left the gates open and let the of wolves in. You always see the bait, but you never see the hook. Your judgment's all clouded with that shit you keep shoving up your nose. You finished? Yeah, I'm finished. And believe me, after this, we're done. I'm done dealing with your shit. Dealing with you is eventually gonna get my fucking ass killed. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death- God. Will you shut the fuck up? This is some serious shit. What you did, most people don't come back from. You got a death wish crossing Volkov. Look, I can get you papers and safe transport to Mexico. But with the risk, it's gonna cost you extra. 20,000, my man, and you disappear. 10K now, 10K when I get to Mexico. Consider yourself a ghost, my friend. In a week, you'll be sipping margaritas and laying with those sweet senoritas. (laughs) That is if you fucking stay alive long enough. Staying alive isn't an issue. I made sure of that. I've got my insurance. Have the boat and your men ready. I'll be at the docks first thing in the morning, Brother, I'll catch you on the other side. I'm out. Where the fuck is this guy going? (urinal flushing) Fuck you, Volkov. (door squeaking) Oh shit, man. I'm sorry. I didn't even know you were in here. Do you do got anything for us? What? You know. (sniffs) She'll do anything to get high, man? Yeah. Yeah, it's me. It's confirmed. Yeah, tomorrow morning. Get your men ready. Oh, by the way, I got some pictures of what you were looking for. Yeah, I'll text 'em to you. I'm done here. Moving on to his brother. [Man] Hey, Jim. (punch thuds) [Man] Lift him up, lift him up, lift him up. What are you doing? We're not fucking done yet. Yo, how much more can this dude take? You're a tough son of a bitch, Jimmy, but you're fucking stupid. You know taking out the judge's wife was a big mistake. Bad move, bro. Where's the book? Fuck you. Where's the book? We know you have it. - Fuck you. We have all day, motherfucker, and we'll beat it out of you if we have to. Fuck you. That hit was my way out. Book of codes was my insurance. No women, motherfucker. No women! That was his rule, and you broke it. Fuck her! Fuck you! Yo, fuck it, let's preheat this asshole. Get the gas. [Man] Time to die, motherfucker. Enough! Stand down. I'm tired of wasting time, and right now, Shepherd, time is not on your side. I have no tolerance for anyone that's bullshitting me and trying to insult my intelligence, so we'll make this very quick and simple. Where is our motherfucking book of codes? Look, man, that rich broad was my way out. I had nothing else. She was my insurance. It was easy. Plug her once right in the head. You stupid motherfucker. Them codes mean everything to us. And your brother, agent. A family man. Wife, daughter. [Jim] What? How do you know? But what I can't figure out, why in the fuck you wanna risk their lives for being so fucking stupid. My family? Fuck you. They have nothing to do with this. The codes, I destroyed all of them. They mean nothing. Fuck me? Fuck me? (engine revving) (brooding music) (guns cocking) Your path begins in hell. I have come to guide you away from your sins, to show you the true meaning of paradise. Salvation. Hope not ever to see heaven, for I will lead you to the other shore, through eternal darkness, through hellfire, and through ice. I am the ultimate truth, the most powerful, that none can escape. They know me as death. Life is not the end, and death is just the beginning. I am your fucking reaper. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (cell phone ringing) (car honking) Rae speaking. Rae, it's Jack. Do you have a moment? Absolutely, sir. I just left the office. Is everything okay? Yes and no. Are you familiar with our undercover agent Mathew Shepherd? I don't know him personally, but I've heard great things about him from colleagues, and some amazing stories about him during training sessions. Why? Unfortunately we just got word that Shepherd's brother Jim was executed by Volkov a couple of days ago. But before he was captured, he gave Shepherd a set of codes. He told Shepherd that those codes are the key to taking down Volkov's entire enterprise. Do we have those codes in our possession right now? Yes, but hold on. Agent Shepherd's communication went dry shortly after his brother's death. We assume that he went after Volkov to try and save his brother. A few moments ago, we got a signal from Shepherd through our sat com. Rae, we think Volkov has Agent Shepherd. Oh shit. Okay, I'll let Nathan and Marcus know to get the team ready to roll out. Rae, I need you on virtual command on this one. Nathan and Marcus will be standing by, should something go wrong. We need you controlling this one from the sky. You should be getting a ping any moment now with your orders. See you in a few hours, Daisy. Yes, sir. (heart beating) (suspenseful music) [Andre] I want you to find Mathew. Take him to the barn. I want you to show him what happens to people that interfere with us. I want you to show him his brother's head. [Agent] Come on, get this asshole. Let's go. [Agent] Get this son of a bitch out. Come on guys, Volkov's coming. Come on, let's get him. Drive him out now. Let's get him out out. Let's get him out! Come on. Let's go. (machine gun firing) (men yelling) (machine gun firing) [Agent] Leader command, we've intercepted Shepherd. All Volkov's men are KIA, except Volkov. He's nowhere to be found. [Daisy] Hang in there, Mathew. Everything's gonna be okay. (soft music) Breakfast is almost ready. You know, you're gonna have to put that away soon. I know, Mom. My battery's almost dead anyways. Thank God. Okay. All right. Here we go. Well, good morning, beautiful. I wish you wouldn't do that. What? Creep up on me like that. You almost burnt me. Can't a man hug his wife in the morning? Ugh, you guys, get a room. So gross. Well, good morning to you too, princess. Well, I'm trying to eat. Put that grossness away. I'm sorry. I just, I didn't wanna wake you up last night. I understand. Don't worry. I just got this book from my brother. It's just filled with numbers and codes, and I'm trying to decipher it. They look like dates, but then there's this page missing. I just, I don't know. Hmm. (tires rumbling) Ugh. Look, I'll be right back. - Babe. - Look, I'll just be a moment. - We talked about this. [Mathew] This just a moment. I'll be right back. I'm sorry. What are you two doing here? I apologize, sir, new information has come in regarding your brother and Agent Morse. We're gonna have to have you come with us. All right. This is gonna be difficult. Give me 15 minutes to change. I'll meet you in the car. Okay. Look, I have to go into work. What do you mean you have to go into work? After what happened? After what you've been through? You told me that you were done, that you were out. You couldn't take any more of this, and neither can I. Something has come up. I promise, I'm just going in to give them a statement. Something always comes up. Rachel, go to your room. Go to my room, seriously? What am I, five? I need to talk to your father, alone. You guys are so weird. What the hell is going on? Listen to me. This is important. Your brother is dead. You were almost killed. What could be more important than your family? - I don't wanna- - Or better yet, your life? Look, I don't wanna argue with you. Then don't. Tell them they need to handle this on their own. This is not your fight anymore. - I owe this to Jimmy. - Jimmy is dead. Honey. I have no choice. I promise, I'm just going in to give them information from the book, then I'm out. I just... Damn them! Just promise me that you'll come back home to your family alive. I promise. I'll be back. I love you both so much. And this means, with the upgrade on the software, it will improve the response time for headquarters data at simulation and transfer by about 20%. In the field, it's even more impressive, as the encryption time is about 30% faster than on our current equipment. (telephone ringing) - Hello? - Shall I send Shepherd up? - Yes. - Confirmed. He's here, sir. Thank you, Brian. I think we'll all agree that we're making excellent progress. When can we use this in the field? Oh, I would estimate that within the next 48 hours, sir. Very good. Any further questions? Are there any handsets that aren't compatible with the upgrade? As of now, that won't be a problem. All the tests confirm that the equipment is compatible and up to date. Anyone else? No? All right, everyone. Shepherd's here. Our number one priority is the capture and prosecution of Andre Volkov. Our second priority is to decipher the codes given to us by Agent Shepherd. How much does Shepherd know, sir? After what he's been through, he's our best shot at bringing down Andre Volkov. I think, with these codes and his input, we're moving in the right direction. Sir, I'll update him on any previous conversations with Agent Morse. Agreed. My team of engineers are standing by, and as soon as we get an update, we'll file a report. The system is 98% complete as we speak. I can provide any additional technical support from my department as well. Ah, Mathew. This is Agent Shepherd, everyone. Mathew, thanks you for coming. How are you? My condolences about your brother. Thank you. I'm intrigued by all this cloak and dagger stuff, Springer. (chuckles) I haven't been called that in a long time. In case any of you didn't know, Springer was my nickname when I was an agent in the field. Mathew and I have worked a few cases together. There'll be time for war stories and introductions later. All right. The object of this briefing is to bring Mathew up to speed. Thank you, sir. Let me begin with a summary based on the information we already have on our primary target, Andre Volkov. Sorry to interrupt. If I can help save us all some, lemme just tell you what I already know. My brother Jimmy was no saint. We all know that. After his time spent in the Marines, he was a changed man. His PTSD and his addictions was something that no one in our family could understand. He managed to maintain a few qualities he picked up in the service, a skill that every agent must acquire. For my brother, it came quite naturally to him. To put it crudely, if you were to be part of an organization that routinely kills people, yeah, Jimmy would do that. I feel like he fell in too deep, and he was looking for any way to get out. That's where this book of codes comes into play. Okay, Mathew. Any idea why? As I said, Jimmy was a chancer. If he's getting what he needs out of a situation, fine. I imagine, being part of a criminal organization, the temptation to outdo that organization would be too much. He probably ripped them off in some way. That's why he needed to get out quick. That's why he sent me what he did, the book of codes, as an insurance policy. What do you think? That's where these codes come into play. I feel like you have a team capable enough to figure this out. I've done my part. Now I wanna see Volkov taken down. My life. My brother. Mathew, we understand. Your operation is at a crisis point. You're hoping I'm gonna bring some new angle you all haven't explored. You think I'm gonna do whatever it takes to bring down Volkov, and you're right. Well, you certainly have our attention. I reviewed the initial summary in the car. It's not so much about what's in the summary as to what's not. Look, we all know why we're here. This is a guy who escapes prison, kills six guards, disappears, comes back as a criminal mastermind. This is a blind man? This doesn't make any sense. You guys are trying to capture a shadow. The only way to do that is to turn the shadow into flesh and blood. (gunshots popping) HQ's on the phone. (bell ringing) - Hold your fire! The line is cold! Come on. Yes, sir? [Jack] Is your team ready? Yes, we are ready. [Jack] How much longer until your training's complete? Yes, we are just finishing up here, sir. [Jack] Do you have the new handsets? Yes, sir. [Jack] You'll need to update them immediately. Yes, sir. Yes. [Jack] Are you confident your team is ready for the operation? Yes, we are ready to move in on the target, sir. [Jack] Excellent. Is Agent Shepherd with you, sir. I have Shepherd right here with me. Agent Shepherd, it is an honor to speak with you. [Mathew] Likewise. On behalf of the team, I just wanna say how much we value your contribution, and we wanna reassure you we have all of our angles covered. We're on a tight watch, but we'll move in as soon as everything is present. I guess you know the score? We're uploading the data and the codes right now onto the computer, and I'm confident this information is gonna lead us in the right direction. All right. See you on the other side. Thanks, Agent Rae. You ready? Let's get to work. Marcus, can you let the team know we're ready? Oh yeah. Finally. Rae. - Nathan. - The time has finally come. Speaking of finally, maybe we can finally finish where we started after this is all said and done. Seriously, Nathan? You're bringing this up right now? - Yeah. - No, it's over, Nathan. It's been over for years, but you keep at this. I don't have a choice. I know this means the world to you to get Volkov. I know. But what are you going to do when it's over? Look, we've been so close. We've been close, and look where that got us, Nathan. We've been close so many times. I need you, I need your head in this now. Do you understand? I need you. I need you to focus. We can talk about this later, but I need you. I need your head in the game now. Do you understand? - Yeah. - Now. (upbeat music) Fuck! (gunshots popping) (bell ringing) (computer beeping) [Computer] (indistinct). Initiating start up sequence. Credentials verified. FRA log in 223475. Agent Rae, Agent Shepherd, it is my pleasure to be assisting you. Your GPS coordinates confirm you are one click away from the target. FRA systems have provided you the green light. You may move in when ready. Proceed with caution. All right, here's the plan, guys. You four are gonna breach. Rae, you and I, we're gonna search outside. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (radio chattering) [Agent] The attic's clear. Clear. (radio chattering) - Clear. - Shepherd's here. Room's clear. Rae, the house is clear. Nothing but old furniture and cobwebs here. What's your location? (radio chattering) Look, you two sit tight. Keep looking around and see if you find anything that identifies where Volkov went. Radio in when you have something. Yes, sir. (soft music) (sighs) I feel like we're chasing a ghost. Tell me about it. How Rae shoots. Hey, bro, what's going on with you and Rae? You used to have a thing, and now she's always on edge every time you're near her. Man, don't get me started. I tried talking to her at the firing range, and all she gave me was this "do your job" bullshit. I don't know. Volkov has really fucked things up. Man, hell yeah. Don't take this the wrong way. She's obsessed, man. I can't have a decent conversation with her without thinking something's on her mind. Is that the reason you two split? Yeah, something like that. (brooding music) I sense your anger. I can smell your fear. This can go one of two ways. Either you're here with me on the take, like your father, or you're here to put me down, as I did your father. You're a good cop Agent Rae. Either way, you're dirty. Who are you to talk about fathers? You have no authority to talk about my father. You didn't know him, and you had no right to take his life. We live by codes. You live by a code. It's what brought you here. 0125. The final entry in my journal. The journal which you have in your possession now. My book of souls. You call it the book of codes, I believe. January 25th. Today's date. The day that I laid my father to rest. The day that I returned home and mourn him. Oh, so you know what it's like to lose a father. They never found your father's body. He's here. What are you talking about, "He's here"? You're standing at his grave. They are all here. Put your hands up, now. - Volkov, show us your hands. - Put your- Agent Shepherd, stay out of this. Put your hands up right now. - Rae, don't do this. We can take him alive. - Put your hands up now! Put your hands up right now! You really want me to pull the trigger? Put your hands up right now. - Come on, my love. - Hands up right now. Finish it. Think! I don't have time for this! Think, Daisy. [Daisy] I'm think right now! Put your hands up right now! Hands up right now! - I grow tired of waiting. - Just breathe. - Agent Rae- - Wanna talk about waiting? She does it to me all the time, except she doesn't just ignore me. I get bitched at at the same time. Hey, check that, man. Time's up! - No! Put your hands up now! - Tick-tock goes the clock. [Daisy] No! Oh fuck! (explosion booming) I feel the light, father. It's so cleansing. It's pure. The light dies with me. (gunshot pops) Rae, what did you do? I, I didn't fire. Your salvation is at hand. (Andre gurgles) Andre. Andre. Andre, can you hear me? Andre. Andre. Andre, you kept calling me Agent Rae. Why is that? You do know I'm Dr. Perkins, right? Andre, we've been working at this for 45 years now. I thought we were making tremendous progress. But it seems that every single time we get to the very end of your story, you seem to shut down, catatonic. I've been meaning to tell you something. I'm retiring next week. So I'm sorry to say, this is our very last meeting. Now, don't worry, I want you to know, I transferred all of my files over to my colleague, Dr. Eaton, and I made sure I found somebody that is just like me to take great care of you. You're in good hands, I promise you. Andre, I want you to know that nothing in this wicked world is permanent. Please remember that. Not even our troubles, okay? It was a pleasure working with you, Andre. Hi, Dr. Nash. Yes, this is Dr. Perkins. I'm at interview room four. If you could do me a favor and send somebody over to take Andre back to his cell. I think he's had another psychotic episode. Oh, perfect, I hear them coming. Thank you so much. (door slams) Hello. Thank you so much. Andre, I just have one more thing to say. Andre, always remember, your salvation is at hand. I went on to win the American Psychological Association Humanitarian Award for my studies of Andre Volkov. He created another world just to escape this one, and he believed every bit of it. It goes to show you that the mind of man is capable of anything. After all, who really knows what reality is? From joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, and rage, Andre experienced it all. But in the end, Andre met the one thing in this world he couldn't beat, death. Andre Volkov never saw the following morning, as he passed in his sleep inside his cell, fading away from this world (lock rattling) Into the next.
