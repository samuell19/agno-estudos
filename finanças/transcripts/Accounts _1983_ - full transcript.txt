[church bells] MARY MAWSON: It's for the boys, all this selling and buying. Trying to lay the ghost of what's happened to us, Harry's death. At last, we're landowners, not someone else's tenants. Our own sheep farm. Fit for my sons, for their future. My family's future lies here in Scotland. A new country, with new people. A land that's strange to us. Have you seen them rooks? The dogs are going wild. Kids way down the burn. Tim, what you doing? Hey, get here. Why, get him out of here. I'm not having him in here. Just heading him off, Mom. Aren't you? Go on. You'll need to bring that one through here, can you? Watch my dog. Go on by. Go gently. Go on, Tim, get out. Grand. Stick it over there. And it's all ours? Just our bit's ours, Andy. Me landlords, me rents, me agents, putting up prices, hanging round my necks. Dad would be pleased. Dad would never have left Allendale. But these are our furs. Not ours till we've grown with them awhile. Not hefty like the sheep. I was in the bank. Come on, Tim. Come on, Tim. Over here. Good dog. Come on, Tim. I'll be mother. Sandwich, eh? No use increasing the sheep till the drainage is done. Maybe I'm right. Best get tops out two weeks later than we're used to. Aye, we'll see. Spring will all be kind of fierce up here, I reckon. You're telling me? Now, do you want to hear me great idea? Aye, go on. I know you don't like [inaudible]. Oh, not that! Hang on, though, and listen. Harry loved rugby football. He thought James was a great coach. James has known Donald and Andy since they were young lads. --whether I ought to. Wondering how to. Harry, took us into town once. When we were courting. Oh, went to a film and then went dancing. All the wrong dances, like. Nothing traditional. Most evenings, I get back and just flop into a bath. Lie there for hours. By the time I've got myself something to eat, got the fire lit, I never really feel like going out. We used to have these great matches in the yard. Harry and me on the two boys. Cricket and football, like. Sometimes, in the most freezing weather, we'd break out of an evening, fix up the lights, and battle away for two hours or more. End up all covered in clods from head to foot. Bleeding ankles, tempers flaring. Boys need a man. Yes. Well, at least you'll not be coming to put up our rents from now on. The boys will be sorry to miss you. Well, I'll be seeing Donald at the rugby club, one way or another. James, you've been good for Donald. Good for us. It looks all stony and useless. It is. Now, if we want to clear that-- Waste of time, Andy. Listen, you. This [inaudible] for increasing pasture down here, man. - What? - More here? Oh, you're joking. Look at it, man, Andy. Well, maybe plant some beet. Or maybe even plant some rice, eh? One more feed would help before increasing the dairy herd. Who wants that, eh? Come on, Tim. I do. Listen, this is my farm as much as it is yours. There's a lot of sense in a milking parlor. No one get down to it, eh? There's money in it, right? I could cope with many more beasts with a parlor. There's a lot can go wrong. Harry's death's still with us. The boys are full of energy but they lack the wisdom of the land that Harry took with him. I still need a man about the place at times. Well, I've some clients I've got to see near Belford, before getting back to Ponteland. Do you know they say it will be at least two years before they put the phone in? [gunshot] Andy's having a big blast. That's scuppered them. Warn us, will you? Rooks didn't give any warning. She said us, idiot. (IMITATES GUNSHOT) Never point a gun. Hold it, Andy. It's empty. Give it here. Leave it alone, I'm gonna clean it. Father's gun, that. It's mine now. And mine. Shut up, you, [inaudible]. Ah, get stuffed. I'm warning you. Baby brother hasn't learned to pull the trigger yet. Do you want tea in here, or flung out in the yard? Flung out in the yard, please. No, Mom! Steady on, I'm meant in here. I'll think about it. Mom's getting sprightly. Be your age. I am. I'm being 19 as hard as I can. It's not easy out here. You're right, there, son. You're settling with sheep. I want something better. I've been working on my poem. What poem? For the Women's Institute. Come on. Let's here it. Don's been writing one as well. Mom! Donald! Uh-huh. No need to tell him. Didn't know he could write. Go on, read it out, Donald. No. Let's hear it. No. It hasn't had the finishing touches. Finishing touches. [inaudible] for them. "I love to walk the sodden fells--" What is this? Get off. Now, you'll none of you read it, now. No, don't tear it, my Donald. Sodden fells? What's one of them? Sodden fells. It means they're wet, you stupid-looking pillock. And something about dangly dells. What lies? You didn't need to tear it up. I've got a better one. You'll hear that when it's finished. Oh, aye. And mine. And mine. Andy! You sly rat! [chatter] Winning much? Dying out. Three nudges. Be able to get drunk now. Low on money? Is there any birds here, is there? A few. Come on, Manny. What's the best place for the birds, you think? Sports club. Where's that? Just straight down the road, there, where you came in. Ready, ready, [inaudible]. We've been approached by one of your boys, James. JAMES: (ON PHONE) Donald Mawson? Aye. He wants to train with us, but seems unclear in his mind whether he should be in our books or yours. JAMES: (ON PHONE) We still think of him as one of us. Really fast, but no technique, James. JAMES: (ON PHONE) Are you suggesting that he'll do better in the borders than down here in Northumberland? Well, of course he will. Of course it depends on the sort of coaching he has, how he develops. Where you been? Wouldn't you like to know? Oh, god. - Move over. - Hey, man. You don't have to wake me up. [cows mooing] Tell you what, if you're going to come in pissed each night, you better sleep in your own bed. It's too cold. There's last season Kelso. Never. It's a remarkable fact. And boars? A few of them, too. I scored like, no doubt. She was a cutting edge mind. But better than nowt. Have you popped it at Hadrian, then? I could trim at Tweed and travel down to Hadrian for the games. I could, like. Pressure's on us to make the switch. No future for me as a player on the borders, anyway. No doubt about that. Playing for Tweed coach on Saturday. That's settled, then. Aye, [inaudible] Mrs. Mawson. Mrs. Mawson. Yes? Oh, that box of groceries looks awful heavy. Let me carry it for you. - I'm managing, thanks I'm John Duff. I run the Tweed coach, rugby team. Oh, yes. Donald told us. Aye. I wanted to talk to you. About Donald? Aye. On Well, he's keen. Aye, we know that. What you want to tell us, Mr. Duff? Look, I hope you're settling in OK up at Dunkeld. Oh grand, thanks. He's a good lad. We want him to set with us. We think we can make something of him, something out of the ordinary. If he sticks with us. Aren't you awful lonely out there? Oh, plenty to do, thanks. Look, I'm in the fertilizer business. Well, I'd better be off now. I mean, if ever you're going to shop the farm, you know. Tell me, are you in the WRI, by any chance? Uh-huh. Well, I'll come on over to see you sometime. Oh? I tell stories, gold rush stuff [inaudible]. But here's my card. Oh, Donald's got your number, thanks. Aye. I'll see you. Come on, come on. You must make sure there isn't a cash flow crisis in six months time. That's the trick. Yes, I know. I'm planning on carrying a few more sheep. We're not exactly overstocked, James. That's a good idea. And the boys are on about clearing rock of all the burned pasture. That's down the river, beyond the little bridge, there. I know. That's always been a problem. They think it's wasted at the moment. Maybes we could plant out a few beets, or even a barn crop. Yes. My dear, look, it's too stony. It floods. The amount of work involved, it's hardly worth it. Well, it's just an idea, like. Donald has deserted us. I'm sorry. Well, he could have done it in the season. Well, rugby at Tweed's a lot more convenient. It's a pity. Donald's his own boss. Except in the house. Yes. Now Andy wants to increase the dairy herd, get one of them milking parlors. I see. The byres will convert easy enough. You see, with Andy looking after the beasts all day, and Donald out with the sheep, they'll not get under each other's feet as much. It'll almost be like two farms in one, James. You're planning an additional bank loan for the new milking parlor? Uh-huh. The fixed interest rate's a blessing, Mary. But don't overdo it. Phew, I've always been a good accountant in the past. True. Boys got a long time ahead of them. Have to plan for when they're older. Look, I hope you don't think I'm stepping out of turn. No. If you feel unsure, or worried about how things are going, then talk to someone right away. I mean, don't set things to one side. You must deal with problems right away. Forgive me, Mary. I'm interfering. They sound like me last night, all that drink. Get out. Come on. Right. OK boys, now listen. Let's get some speed up here. On the whistle. [whistle] Come on boys, move it. That's it. Come on, that's it. Go on, yes, pass, pass it. On my-- yes. Yes, yes. balls out. Come on, boys. Good. Well done. There's a couple [inaudible] on there that you didn't have last season. Well done. Come on right over here. We'll get [inaudible] Well, come on. [interposing voices] Hey, bring it to me. That's it. Come on, now. Nice and tight and compact. [interposing voices] Come to me, nice and low, like. Where have you been? Sorry. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. No, let's go home. It's only half past nine. I don't drink at Tweed after training. Why, man? [inaudible] Kelso You hardly know the place yet. No, let's go home. - I'm not ready to. - Oh, man. Takes an hour to get back. I've got an early start in the morning. I know, young un, but there's folk I want to meet yet. Man, you've been on the town all night. You're reeking. I'll be driving. - You? You've not even passed your test. Well, you're not fit yet, Andy. Look, it's me that's picking you up tonight. Anywhere. I was hoping I might happen upon a lass. Oh, man. There's no time for that. No, come on, it doesn't take much time. Oh, you're a wibbit, you. Women in, women out. There might be something for you. Like What Like a daughter. Daughter? Who is this? Have you been in the old people's home? No. I thought you said it was a lass you were after. Look, she's nearly a lass, right? Well, how old is she? I don't know. Look, you don't ask personal questions like that when you're screwing the ass off someone. Oh, god. How old's her daughter, then? Ten maybes? Look, she's nearly a woman, right? Just like you're nearly a man. What do you mean, nearly? Anyway, why don't you go with her? The mother shoves her out of the way. Come on, do you not fancy it? Not much. - Come on. - No. Look, we're wasting time. Not with you, there. I couldn't. I don't want to watch you with her. I'd be busy myself, man. Not me own brother. I couldn't, man. That would be in-- The Look, man, we're sleeping the same bed at home. That's different. We're used to that. You are horny, aren't you? Shut up, [inaudible] Me brother's got a hard on. - I'll knack you. - Ooh. Where's the Land Rover? Ah, ha ha, kill you. Have to catch us first! Little Big Horn. Ow, man! Watch it, will you? Right, let's go. No. Give us the keys, then. No way. Look you stay on. I'll go home, and I'll pick you up in the morning. - At the bridge end. - Right. And don't tell me mom, right? OK. There's the keys. Where's the Land Rover? It's on the corner. Oh, half past five. I forgot me watch. Aye, half five. Or you could do the cows first, and make it half past eight. That means you wouldn't have to get up so early. And waking up me, like. Right, half past eight. And Nellie's got an ulcer. Right. And mommy's got the shits. Behave. Course. - Are the cows done? - Aye. Move over. I'll drive. Right. [calling to sheep] Come on, Tim. Come on, Gill. [whistles] - Go on, Gill. Go on. Tim, come on, Tim. That top looks weak. You cannot tell, man. I'll bet you it is. We'll soon see. I still think we should have bought a couple extra tops. I still think we put them tops in too early. Try telling the ewes that. I hope they don't lamb too early, mind. Ah, they won't. Hello? Mrs. Duff? Andy Mawson here. Aye, that's the one. I know I shouldn't. However, I had to phone you. It's healed. Does that mean it's [inaudible]? I've had some sleep, about three hours. I know I'm not behaving myself. It's more fun being bad. You should know that, Mrs. Duff. I didn't mean exactly that, like. I didn't mean it. No, honest. I'm sorry. Of course I go to church. What's that got to do with it? I'm driving up this afternoon. I've got problems with me distributor. No, I'm not going to clinic. Only townies get that, man. So I'll look by. Of course, I'll make it snappy. If you want it snappy, you can have it snappy, Mrs. Duff. Hell! [chatter] Hey, boys! Aye, you, son. Come here. [chatter] I've taken a lot from you, son. How many games has it been now? Dunno, you tell me how many? Seven or eight. You don't know. No, not exactly. Now, listen, son. You are holding on to the ball too long. That is the way they play at Hadrian. You are playing at Tweed, now, remember. [cheers] You cannot expect to bound your way through. The lads up here can really tackle. [interposing voices] Hey, when you get the ball in the center, I want you to say to yourself, can I make 10 yards? Now, if you cannot make ten yards, then you pass that ball, quick as a flash, no hesitation. You've got Fergus in the line. He's got a fair bit of pace, son. And if he scores-- if he scores, you score. Because you have been part of that movement. Wingers are for using at Tweed. OK, son? - All right. Right. Good. Very well. Do ten press ups. [interposing voices] Do ten press ups. Right, come on. Speed up. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Do another one for luck. [interposing voices] Do it! Now get up. One more thing. Once you've moved the ball out, I want you to run round and support Fergus for the win. That's right. You mess out the other set on occasion, like you did tonight. Like, that was good, Donald. Now get your muddy, scrawny, little body clean. Into the bath. Move it, come on. [interposing voices] I fear there's mud behind your ears, son. [interposing voices] Oh, quiet. [interposing voices] I know what you lot need. A nice, good, cold-- [interposing voices] There's no way we can afford another vehicle, Andy. Donald will be passing his test soon. Hell, he drives the Land Rover more than I do. The coppers will catch him one of these days. Uh-huh. Well, I'm going to put a stop to all of that too. It's about time someone put their foot down in this house. Have you seen the plans for the milking parlor? Why, what do you think I've been doing all day? And don't try changing the subject, Andrew Mawson. What subject? You know what's on me mind. Really? You think I haven't heard about your carrying on? What do you mean? The folk at the WRI were full of it. Talking when they thought I was out of earshot. What they have been saying, like? Unrepeatable things about other folks' wives. They're just a bunch of old gossips. And I don't know why you bother with them. You'll land my family in trouble before you know where you are. Can you not stick to courting, like the other young men? What other young men you're on about? There's nothing different about me. I may be a bit more imaginative than some. Oh, that's the least of it, from what I hear. And it's affecting the farm, and us. How is that, like? Why, milking the cows later and later. It always gets done. And all this talk of raising another 50,000 pounds for the new milk parlor? It's done. The bank's agreed. The principal, at least. It's just the papers that need signing, now. You'll get no signature from me, the way you're carrying on. You'll benefit too. You know, the money side of things. Ah, you thought it was canny enough idea when we first discussed it though, didn't you? Only if we get enough back from the increased milk yield to pay off the loan. It's getting things balanced that matters. It's risks like we've never faced before. We owning things [inaudible] things slip, and you're playing about, as though you owed nothing to nobody. Your father would have whipped you, and hauled you up by now. Would we have? His insurance money, and the compensation is all tied up in that loan. Now you remember that. We may own a farm now. But we have no cash to speak of. So end all all this talk of new cows. Well, what of the milking parlor? You're looking fit. Training's harder here, mind. If you decide you've had enough at the end of the season, you can always come back to us. I'll be taking me driving test Tuesday. So I'll be getting a car sometime. And driving legal. Do you want us back? Yes. I'm not settled yet, James. I still think myself back to [inaudible]. Things are different here. The air, the fells, the wind. It tears you more than it did at home It's harder, somehow. Mind, winter's been kind of mild. Plenty of hay in? Enough. Maybe it's more than enough, if it carries on the way it's going. It's good, like. But on the fells it's too boggy. Marshy, you know? And it's easy to get lost when the mist comes down. And your instinct's don't take you home some nights. Not straight away, like. We're not with the land yet, James. It's hard. Is there anywhere around here I can have a pee? There's a canny wall around there. Oh, I don't think I should. Well, the river's a [inaudible]. It would take no harm, man. Even with a bladder like yours. Oh, well. Keep a lookout. Give a whistle if anyone's coming. OK. [whistles] God. I don't see anyone. Bloody hell, Donald! I've pissed all down my leg. Sorry, James, I didn't mean to whistle. I am bursting. Help. Will Come with me, I'll show you where. Hurry. Tie a knot in it. We might never get it undone. We? [dog barking] Start them out, here, Donald. Spread it around. This should keep them going for a while. Aye. Come on, then. Good. Well, I hope things go well for you now. Thank you. This new equipment's a lot easier to work with. Aye. [inaudible] Under milk yield certainly looks a lot better. Mom! Where's the application? [inaudible] above it, where Donald left it. You don't want to get any of this stuff near your balls. They catch fire, you know. Oh, mine catch fire without that. Just hang on a minute. [screams] Leave off, [inaudible]. That'll warm you up. You bent bastard. Ah, right up your ass. Aw, get stuffed, will you? What are you two playing at? Oh, disgusting. I'm not standing for that. Donald's been queer all day. Aw, get lost. Something's up. Aye, something is. Well, get decent, the pair of you. Now Andy, sit down on that sofa, and read the Farmer's Weekly. Donald, sit on that chair, and read the Hexan Courant. Yes, mam. Right. Now I'm going back into the kitchen to fix your teas. Not another sound. Yes, mom. Poof Turd. What's that you got behind that newspaper? Get off. Hey lad, how's like can you get the Squeal Deal catalog? Give it here. Where'd you get this? None of your business. Borrowing it. - Who off? - A friend. Give us it. What friend's this? Give it here. Stop shouting. Who lent you it? James. What's all the racket? Donald's been hiding the Squeal Deal catalog, so he can have it first. Mom, tell him to give us it. I'll have that. I was reading that. I was first. You're all schemes and plans. You, you're sly. A sly brother. Can I have it, mom? No, I want to have a look. Tea's burning. Help. Fight you for it. Right, Cumberland wrestling rules. Bastard! Fuck! Bloody-headed turd. Smelly socks. Y-front. Snuff. Up me. How worthless. Let me up. How insignificant. I got him, I got him. I'll kill you. Get up, the pair of you. Get up. I'll not forget that, you shit, Donald. [interposing voices] --- that word in my house. Used to be me underneath you. Things are changing now, eh? My turn now. Fighting, carrying on at each other's throats. I'll not have it. I cannot take much more. It's his fault, Mom. Sit down. Ah, see, Donald, serves you right. - And you. - Serves you right, now. Shut up. Sit down at that table. What is it, Mom? Hands off. Liver hot pot. [groans] [inaudible] Quiet, mom. I'm praying. Carry on, Donald. Dear God, thanks for mom's stew. It's hot pot. And for my queer brother. Donald. And help me to recognize chronic liver fluke infestation when I see it. Amen. That wasn't very nice. It's the amen, Mom. Cut the bread, please, Andrew. Ooh, Andrew. Bonny bum Donnie. [inaudible] the bread. [inaudible] Hey, love. Mom, is that all I get? Eat it slow. I am starving I'm ravenous. Now I'm going to read the Squeal Deal catalog. I'm going to hold up a photograph of one of the tops from the catalog. And I want you to tell us how much it went for at the market. Right? No. Oh, go on. Dad used to do it every year. Go on. Right. First one. How much? 1,800. Mom? Not at table. Oh, go on, Mom. Ah, why, 900. Not bad. But Donald's right. 1,800 pound. Right. How about this one? How much? Hold it closer. 4,450. 2,000. I'm good [inaudible] you know. How do you do it, lad? You're bang on again. 4,450 pounds. I look at the wellies. Tops didn't wear wellies, man, Donald. No, man. Come here. Look, there the wellies are here more than the top. That's Eddie [inaudible] wellies. They are? I remember the sale, and [inaudible] that was followed by Lazenby for 4,450 pounds. Overpriced, in my opinion. Aye, it was, like. My legs are still aching. And have you got sores in your mouth? And is your nose running? No, send for the vet. Sit down, you. There's more to come. What is it? Jelly. Oh, hey, I love jelly. Oh, I hate it. I'll have yours. No, I'd rather eat it. Now, then. Donald, your hands are filthy. They were clean a minute ago. He's filthy all over, him. Aw, shut up. Ta. It's as hard as nails. Hold your tongue, Andy. [interposing voices] Donald! You pig, Donald! Andy! Missed! Jesus, Christ, sit down. I can't take anymore. Andy, I declare truce. Well, [inaudible] On one condition. Aye. If I go and try to finish me jelly, do you promise to leave us alone? Go on, then. No, I want a promise. Do you swear? I promise I'll let you finish your jelly. Did you hear that, Mom? Uh-huh. Now then, everyone please note that I'm going to eat most of me jelly. But I'm going to leave just a little eensy bit, because Andy said there was a truce till I've finished. But I'm not going to finish it. Is that clear? The pair of you is like animals. Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Mom. Thanks. There's things I want to say. What kind of things? Thoughts I've been having. Thoughts. Now that Andy's got his milking parlor-- Oh, go on, then. I could be making more money. There's grants to be had. James was telling us. James? There's folks that want to visit the borders, tourists. We could improve our property using other bugger's money. We can't afford to keep raising loans. It's thousands more with a parlor to pay off. It pays for itself, idiot. Look, the Nicholsons of Hartley Shield made about 10,000 pounds doing almost nothing, with bed and breakfast and such like. Almost nothing? Working her fingers to the bone, more like. Well, the burned pasture has beaten is. We waste a day slugging away, clearing in the rocks in that. We're never going to make out after that unless we use our heads. We best leave it as it is, and prepare for a camp site. Perhaps even a caravan park. Donald, once you start something like that, it's stuck there with you. And it grows, and it suffocates the life out you, and the family, and the beasts. We'd all suffer. Resources isn't just for making money. It's for making lives better. You sound like Da. There's no hurt in that. Look, when you owe thousands for the farm, and thousands for the parlor, resources is for making money. Not your way. What's that? What? I can't hear-- Oh, shut up. [dog barking] Donald, be careful. [screams] Mom, jump in the Land Rover, get some help. Where are the keys? They're in the Land Rover. Go and get some help. [interposing voices] I'm going as fast as I can. Hurry up, mother! Get the fire brigade! Hurry up! Hurry up! In the barn. Get it over this side, and the middle. Andy, get back. Get back, lad. It's a waste of time, man. Do you want some tea? Yes, thanks. [shouting] Let's go, boys. [interposing voices] Ah, no. Faster! Go for him, go for him, go for him, nice [inaudible]. Well done. Now get over. Yes! Pass over. Pass it. Pass the bloody ball, Mawson. Fuck! Jesus, look at us. Get after them! Look at that. Been bad ever since the fire. And you know who'll get the blame for that, don't you? Aye, me. Come on. Come on. Come on, girls, that way. What's that idiot up to? He's just getting himself tidy. Mom, you do me shirt cuffs up for us, please? What's that smell? I found some Brut up there. Thirty years old. Father's? Sounds canny to me. Better than smelling of rancid udder. Where did you get those cuff links? These were your father's cuff links. Let's see. A wedding present from your Uncle Joseph. They're silver, mind Who said you could wear those? There's no point just leaving in the drawer forever. You should still ask. Well, Mom doesn't mind, she gave them to us. Oh? Now, there's something for you too. Like what? I thought you could try on his engagement ring. Can you not just leave his things together without interfering? Do you not think it's too early to start splitting his things up? It's best to make use of things. I'm the oldest. You should have asked me first. What's so special about being the oldest, like? You should of asked us. I should have asked you together. Oh, aye. That would have been better, like. I'm sorry, now. I was wrong. Donald, hurry upstairs and get dressed. I never realized you care so much. Don't care. I still have the feeling that Dad'll come walking through the door. Every time I hear the tractor pull up in the yard, I expect to hear him come and bang his way in. Working too hard. You need friends, or the [inaudible]. Oh, go on. Where's the shoe polish? What a little tart you are. Why won't you tell us where you're going? Didn't want you onto us all day. Where are you going, then? Edinburgh, for the night. Not the whole night. Edinburgh, how? He's picking us up. Who? James. Really? Aye, [inaudible] rugby forms. Thought you were sick of rugby? Sick of Tweed, more like. How does that look, Mom? Ooh, very good. You, don't look like any brother of mine. Don't look like a walking haystack? Like your kid, Kelso. They'll probably think you're daft in Edinburgh. Aye, they might still. I wish somebody was coming to take me out for the evening. You ever thought of getting another husband, Mom? How are we able to do it and put ideas into her head. Well, she's not entirely past it yet, are you, Mom? You should know about that. - That's enough. You little twat. You're mad, Andy! Bastard! You snapped Dad's cuff link! Look what you've done! It's broken, look. Aye, run away and hide. - Don't be hard on him, son. - What am I going to do? Let's have a look, Donald. Oh, I can have that mended in a minute. - Hurry. - Wait a minute. He's coming. There. That will do it. You can get it mended properly later. Hello Come in, James. [inaudible] Excuse me barging in. Not quite ready, James. OK. There, that's settled it. Right. Upstairs and get your jacket. Thanks, Mom. This has rather caught us all on the hop. Sorry about that. Donald rather sprung this expedition on us. Are you going to be late? No. No, not if we hurry. I meant coming back. Oh, I see. Oh, I thought we'd stop and have fish and chips. We'll be back before midnight, though. Well, he's got an early start in the morning. Yes. His turn with the cows, getting them started, at least. Right. Ready, Mom. Bye now. Behave, now. - We'll try to. - Bye. Bye. Bye. There's something about fishing in Horse and Hounds. Where is it? In your bedroom. I'll find it later. It's still early. Beasts can look after themselves tonight. I've finished work. I've got a proposition to make to you, Andy. What? Well, let's go down to Alladale for the evening. Alladale takes an hour and a half. Well, just about gives us time. Guess we may be an hour, by the time you're ready to set off. Well, there's canny chance of a lock in. What's come over you, Mom? I'll drive back, mind. No arguments about that. And you'll come when I tell you? Promise? Aye. And no stopping over the night. Right. Well, hurry and get dressed, lad. I'm not going out with the local scruff. Why, get washed and shaved. There's a clean shirt in the drawer. And I'll be ready to leave in 10 minutes. What's your fish like? Mmm, nice. The whole world should know, fish and chips in Kelso can be fun. Start again. P. R. I. The great thing about tonight is we've talked about nothing serious. What is it? P, R, I? O, I. O, I? Challenge. No, man. P, R, I, C. Donald, what are you thinking of? Nothing much. No doubt. K, continued. Prick, continued. What more is there? L. Oh, do you spell prickly with an EY? Nope. Can you be prickled? Not tonight, James. Oh, you can prickle someone. I prickle, you prickle, he, she or it prickles. Only if you were a horny blackberry. Tonight I've been a T, W, I, T, a C, L, O, T, a F, double-O L, and that ultimate humiliation of D, O, P, E. Please, just this once, let me prickle. Go on, then. But don't start with a P again. Oh, hell. Where can you pee in Kelso? Oh, not again? I'm full. Some dustbins down that alley. But I don't know if they're big enough, mind. Whistle properly this time. Remember the great flood? Hold on. I'm coming as well. [inaudible] drainage ditches needed. Aye, huge grant. Mustn't miss our chance, though, making it last. [inaudible] doing a play for a competition. Oh, aye? Thought I might take a look in. Do you fancy it? Maybes. Andy, how many drainage tanks do you think we'll need? Thousands. Hold on. Gotta piece of paper on you? Tried working it out on me hand. Nah, I haven't got any. Hey, Don. Look what I've found. What is it? It's my poem from last winter. Remember them poems we wrote? Oh, aye, god. And me bad one? I tore it up. You couldn't [inaudible] Hey, lad. Shut up man, listen. When I'm mixing Nellie's feed, I think on buns and cakes and bread. But when at night I stuff me belly, out me head comes poor old Nellie. Do you call that poeting? Course it is. What's yours, then? Oh, no. Come on, there's no one listening. Poetic, like? Well, let's hear it. The sigh of the wind, the bleat of the sheep, the curlews complaining, that they are [inaudible] The skylarks are chattering, the gentle hear bells. All are 'a singing the song of the fells. The frost in the window, the drifting of snow, logs for the fire, a warm place to go. [inaudible] mornings. Hay for the sheep. Songs in the evenings, early to sleep. Ain't exactly early to sleep with you bouncing around all night. What do you mean, me? Hey, it's a good poem, that, though. I like the drift in the snow [inaudible] for the fair. It's really good. Yeah. Finished stuffing your face? Aye. Best get back to work. Aye, [inaudible]. We need to pace out from here to the reeds. Aye. Go. Morning, Mary. Morning. Thought I'd come and deliver myself. Oh? Ah, well, seeing as how as I haven't been up to see you since you moved in. Very kind of you, like. I'll make you a coffee. Grand, no sugar, thanks. Are you not going to unload it first? Oh, of course. Where do you want it? How many bags is there? Just 10. Back up to yon byre then. They'll be room in there. All right. Here you are now. Thanks. Keeping busy? Aye. I've been over to Nickleton and [inaudible] this morning. Getting yourself around. I loved your stories. Really good even, that. Thanks. The lads away out? Oh, aye. Planning out a whole lot of drainage ditches. They say it's pretty wet in places. I have still to meet the eldest one. Andy. Our paths never seem to cross. No? Will they be back for their dinners? No. Oh, aye, yes. They might just. - Oh, no. Don't bother. I was just wondering. Carrying then bags must keep you fit. Yeah. Carried a few of them in me time, John. - 87. - Aye. Right. - Hey, Andy. - What? Our gear is down the track there. - All right, go. - Come back here, you. None of your cheating. Come on, get in a straight line. Not that sort of a straight line. Get behind that bit of grass, come on. Get your marks. Hey, get back six inches. Get set. Go! You getting too old for it, man. I got a stitch. My parents were in India, you see? Oh, I went a few times, but mostly I spent the holidays with an aunt in Tunbridge Wells. It was all right. She used to take me to some rocks to play. Wellington rocks. I used to run away. I knew she was frightened of heights, so wouldn't be able to follow. I used to climb up to the highest of those rocks-- and making sure that she was watching-- used to leap across this little chasm on to the rock beneath. Aunt Sylvia used to scream at me. I thought if I did it often enough, she might have a heart attack. It seemed a wonderful idea at the time. And I was jealous of the other boys. There was no aunt screaming at them, making fools of them. They were independent, dirty, free. And I wished they were my friends. Donald's told us how much you enjoy the bath with the other lads after training. It sounds like a sheep dip. Yes, the water is deliciously muddy. They're in. I'll just get on with their teas. Good. Hello. Hello, Andy. Where's Donald? Oh, he's putting the dogs away. I'm knackered. Busy? Aye. What's the fencing like out back? It's canny, mostly. Draining [inaudible] like. Hello. Hi. Hi, Mom. Mom's making some tea. I better wash me hands. - No need. - What? No need. No need to wash them just cause I'm here. Spends all day washing yourself. Do I, [inaudible] There's yours, son. Thanks, mom. Andy generally sleeps for an hour when he comes in from the felltop. Don't tell him all of our secrets. You might as well have that. Thank you. Drainage [inaudible] is going to cost to bit, mind. The kind of [inaudible] needed. It's got to be done, though, if we're going to take on more sheep, it's got to be. Are you clean yet, [inaudible]? Aye. Here you are. Thanks, Mom. Right. Now that we're all together-- Hold on. What's this, then? Shut up, man. This is serious, now. Go on, then. James and me, we've been going over all the accounts, all afternoon. Oh, aye. Shut up, man. It's time to face up to the facts of life. Aye, do you want them from James or from me? Let James tell. Aye, let him. Right, well, it's bad news, I'm afraid. It's not disastrous. You've been unlucky. Get on with it, James. Right. There isn't enough cash to pay off the interest on the various loans you have outstanding, even though the interest rates are fixed and highly advantageous. It's really the fire that's caught you out. The milk yield's been poor. I know that. Not just poor, Andy. You're not getting enough cash back from the milk sales to keep yourselves afloat. And well-- Just wait. Wait a minute. And you made a strategic error in not accepting the insurance offer made to you over the damage to the byre. How was that, like? You seem to have got it into your heads that the byre was worth what it might have become, if you'd been able to develop it as an extension to the milking parlor. It only becomes an asset of that sort once the work has been carried out. At the time of the burning it was just a byre. It has to be valued as such. After the top sales, we'll have money. Andy, you can't wait that long. By then, the debts will have grown fantastically. Once things start to slide, they get out of control so fast, with such a large loan involved. Well, what we going to do? We're not selling up. Never. I'll tell you what you've got to do. Tell us. Firstly, settle the insurance claim straight away. Accept what the loss adjusters have offered. If you agreed to that, I'll phone through the office and get them to send you a check by return. Hang on. If we hang on a bit longer, till after the top sales-- If you want to hang on to your farm, you have got to take my advice. To put it simply, the receivers are going to move in on you soon. Carry on. Secondly-- this is going to hurt. Are you ready? Aye. You've got to slaughter the whole of the dairy herd, and take the common market golden handshake. You will make a lot of money that way, much more than the value of the cattle. Then, you sell off the milking parlor equipment. It's almost new, you should make a reasonable price. If you do all that you will eliminate one loan altogether. You will pay of all your outstanding interest repayments, and-- well, you'll even have a little extra cash in the bank. We'll think about it. All the figures, with letters, are here. Your mother and I have been over the whole lot this afternoon. And she'll explain anything that you don't understand. We'll think on it. You have got to act fast. I mean, this week. Hell, man-- You're not bloody tenants, you're bloody landowners, and you've got to behave as such. Donald's away. That's enough. You said your bit. That's enough. Yes. Yes, I've said my bit. Right, well, I've got food to prepare. I'm starving. Of course you are, son. They've worked damn hard, James. I know. It's a good farm. You've just got to get things right. Yeah. Are you OK, Donald? Aye, I reckon. That's good. I've got James a present. Here you are. I've wrapped it up. No need. What is it? Take it, please. Why, thank you. Open it. Dad's cuff links. Aye. You shouldn't. They're not yours to give away. They are mine. Mom give them to us. And they haven't been able to have been fixed since you broke them. That's very kind of you. I really think these ought to stay in the family. Mom, he's giving Dad's cuff links away in here. No. Look, take them, please. They're not yours to give. They are. I think that's very generous of you, Donald. I can't accept them. Why not? Why not? Here. Please. Look, they're yours now. Are you leaving? I'll go after him. I'm terribly sorry. It's not your problem. Do you mind if I don't stay for tea? You're very welcome. I've got some people I've got to see down in [inaudible] about some trees. Stay for a while. No, I must go. Come back tomorrow, or the next day. Please. Got a load of paperwork to get through this week. There's a chance of a partnership, if I play my cards right. My family needs you. I need you. Please. Come back soon. I will try. You can always get Donald to phone my flat in the evenings. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get up. Come on. Get on. Get on. Get on. Get on. [gunshot] [chatter] Aye. I'll do my best for you, Mrs. Mawson. Take a look out, Donald? Don't worry now, about that note. It's early yet. Aye, well-- it's all happened before now, eh? Mom? I'm not going out there? There's not a soul. There's no one Come here. I'm staying here, me. Ah, don't be daft, man. I know for a fact there's quite a few folk interested. I can assure you that, Mrs. Mawson. I'll walk out with you. They're coming. Aye, I told you so. Great. Well, I'd better get outside and check things over, then. Have one of Mom's sausage rolls? I will. I'll have one as well. They're for guests. Well, thanks, Donald, and I better get done some work, here. Andy, outside. Make folks welcome. Come on. Come on, Mom. [chatter] [knocking gavel] Now, there's only one item up for auction today, ladies and gentlemen. And this lot includes all the milking parlor equipment, the piping, and the tanks. The buyer is responsible for its dismantling and removal. And the equipment is sold as seen. Now this equipment was installed new only a very short time ago, ladies and gentlemen, as most of you know. And it is very unusual for equipment that is virtually unused to come on the market so quickly. So, have I any offers now at 4,000 pounds? 4,000, 4,000, 4,000. 3,500, 3,500, 3,500, 3,500.

I've not done too bad. We've got what James said we would. Hey, you. Where are you going? Piss off. Do you want your head pushed through that fucking wall? Do you, hey? [screams] [inaudible] Oh, I've been looking forward to catching you in your job. So you're the one who's been drinking all the beer, and eating all the crisps, eh, you young bugger? Jesus, you're nothing but a kid. She been having it off with kids. What's your name, son? Andy, get off me, will you? Andy what? Mawson. Your brother a Donald Mawson? Yes. Ah, shit. Ah, shit. Shit, aw-- What, tomorrow, like? Fucking Mawsons everywhere. Fucking up my coach, screwing in [inaudible]. Why don't you go back south of the border where you belong, you fucking English shit, eh? If I catch you within 100 yards of that piece I'll break your bloody legs. I play rugby too. I don't care if you are captain of fucking lines. You stay out my life, right? Good night, Flop. You, bastard, you. [screams] [sheep bleating] [whistles] Come on, Tim. [sheep bleating] What do I look like, Mom? (LAUGHING) You look fantastic. Andy, man, come down here, look at this, man! (IMITATING SHEEP) Land, you frightened us. Andy, you look smashing. Do you want to know a secret? Aye. You won't tell anybody, mind? Course not. John Duff's been writing to us. What about? Oh, things. What things? This and that. About rugby? Not really. He stops us in the streets. He even wanted to carry me shop up. What does he write in his letters? Hey, don't ask. He wants to take us out. Is that it? Never. He wants to meet us and that. He's got a wife, Mom. Ask Andy. That's all finished with. What do you see him, mom? Do you want us to [inaudible]? I wouldn't mind that, just be making things up with him as well, down with the young farmers. I'd love to smash that bugger. No, I'll sort it out. - Really? - Mm-hmm. It's not a problem anymore. So why tell us? Well, let her. No one else, is there? Sorry. I just don't want you think your Mom's past it, that's all. I could still have another bairn, you know. Here, you're not going to, are you, Mom? No, I said I could. I'm not going to. There's life in the old cow yet, you know. Ah, shut up, stink on. Listen, you'd better be off, you'll be late. Aye. Ooh, and Mr. Duff says he's interested in buying the Land Rover. Oh, aye? If the price is right, mind. Are you on speaking terms yet, Andy? Aye, just about. Hey, I'm not. I hate him, me. Leave it to me, Mom. I'll sort it out. Come on, lad. Right. See you later, Mom. Good luck. [imitating cow] [imitating sheep] (SINGING) Daisy, daisy, give me your answer, do. (SINGING) Can't you tell that I hate this sight of you? (SINGING) You really make me shudder. (SINGING) Stop sniffing around my udder. (SINGING) I thought I'd scored. (SINGING) With you, I'm bored. (SINGING) Do you mean it? (SINGING) Yes, I do. [applause] (SINGING) Hail to the lousy farmers, who cares if they harm us? Let's sing together, we are having a ball. Up yours, you lousy buggers, butchers can chop and hack the flesh for the [inaudible]. Oh, what a lovely stew. Lamb chops, a steak for you. Black pudding, mince gristle, some sausages and beans. Let's have a [inaudible] So let's all get a piece of shouting, hip, hip, hooray. [crowd clapping and singing] [applause] [interposing voices] [cast singing] That's all, and congratulations. I'll get out-- [interposing voices] --saved this one, specially for you. Too much salt. [inaudible] water? It was a good show. Can I stay the night with you, at Ponteland? What? I want to spend the night with you. No. Why? You've got to start work early. There's no cows anymore. No, you've got to get back tonight. But you got tomorrow morning off, you told us. I'm not taking a boy back to my place for the night, OK? Don't call me a boy. I'm old enough to have me head shot off in Northern Ireland. OK? - I'm taking you home. Look, I want to spend the night with you. No! Is that all that you can say. Do you not want to, like? This conversation never happened, all right? Course it happened. Get in the car. I don't want to get in. Don't be difficult, Donald. You don't understand anything, do you? Are you ready? Aye, take us home. Thanks for the chips. I can't do any more. It's a fair price, John. It's been a really reliable vehicle, then. Eh? Yes, please. Two [inaudible] please. Now then, I've got another proposition for you. Go on. Next season, I'm looking for someone to take over the wains that are just starting out. They need an older man there to give them a bit of encouragement training. [inaudible] Oh, not me, John. I forgot all about the game, man. You used to play, Andy. I know that. I've checked you out. Jane from [inaudible] said you were a promising youngster. - Did they say that, like? - Aye. I tell you what, here. Next season, you come down here. But you're no worse than most of senior foes for the young farmers play. In fact, you can chamber in for a couple of sessions, then take over the wee laddies. I'll give you a hand. We need new blood here, Andy. You could spare it. Call [inaudible] of us. What we're saying is, there's room for you here. If you're willing. Well, I'll think about it, John. Well, you belong here, [inaudible] You may be bloody English, but you're bloody Scotch, too. [interposing voices] Anyway, you got the summer to think it over. All right. I will. Andy, we need Donald next season. He's being a bit difficult. Sort of why I'm here. Da-dum! What do you think of that, eh? Who from? An admirer. No chance. They must be myopic. Ohh, long words. We play this word game. Who? James and me. Finished with him, now, eh? I thought we hadn't seen much of him lately. Let's drink to our farm. The farm. The farm. Do you reckon Mom was hot for James? Not the sort of person that needs to get not about. Not in my opinion. Nowt doing there, are you? Nowt. How are you getting on with John Duff down at Tweed? Not very good. Are you packing it in? I doubt it. I've got a plan. Burned pastures. Oh, aye. There's a case for it. Now, that the beasts is away. It's no good planting barley or beet crops. Now's the time to look into that plan of yours. The camping caravan thing. Oh, great. Makes more sense now, doesn't it? It's worth looking into at least. Well, we can't afford to waste we've got, can we? No promises, mind. But it's worth looking into. Have you talked to Mom about it yet? No, not yet. Hey, maybe she'll get another car. We'll have to sometime. Well, you've been hogging the Ford. Have I hell. Aye, you have. [inaudible] Let's play cards. No. Play a snap. No. So what are you so keen on? What do you mean? You heard. [inaudible] just now, like. That's exactly what I meant. Do you mind? Not really. But not certain? Aye, it is. Suppose you'll be blaming me. No. Good. Let's go out poaching. Cannot poach your own pheasants Too far up the bloody other buggers in this. No, let's take another dram. Good idea. Maybes you should sleep in your own bed from now on? Right. OK? It's cold. Can be. There's no need for rules. Not really. I'll get the gun. What for? - Got an idea. - What? Come out in the yard. Why? We'll blast the rooks. Be no more noisy in the mornings. Ah, leave them be. They'll be in their nests, now, Donald. A couple of blasts should shake them up. I'll settle them. Hang on, they're just rooks, then, Andy. Ah, leave them be. They're vermin. And they've got to be kept down. [gunshot] We're the masters on this farm. From now on, they're going to sing our tune. [gunshot] [gunshot] [music playing]
