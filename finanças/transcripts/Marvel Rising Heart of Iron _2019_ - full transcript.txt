I'm okay, T-T. And you, what a good doggy! Yes, you are! Come here, big hug. Oh, my God, yeah. - [angry chittering] - What, you've never seen a teleporting dog before? Then you're gonna get a kick out of this. Lockjaw! - ♪ Team ♪ - Let me through, AMI. We can end this. - This will end when I end you. - Having trouble with your targeting subroutine? Or does someone in there not what to hit me? - Is that why you aren't firing back? Afraid you'll hurt your friend? AMI is gone. You're all alone. - Not quite. Can you hold off all of us? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Hang on, AMI. I'm here. [beeping] - Riri? The virus is fighting back. [beeping] Your friends will pay for your betrayal. - Not if I have anything to say about it. ♪ ♪ - Target locked. [weapon powering up] - Come on, come on. - Firing. - Got it! [electronic whirring] ♪ ♪ AMI, is that you? Only you? - Yes. Thank you, Riri. I'm sorry. - What? No, this wasn't your fault, AMI. You're gonna be fine. We just have to override the program and shut down the gate. - Hala eliminated that option when she destroyed the console. The only way to close the gate now is to destroy its power source. - But...that's your arc reactor. AMI, no. You won't survive! We've been through so much together, I-- You're all I have left. - You must do it, Riri. You cannot be a hero without people to be a hero for. [somber music] ♪ ♪ - Good-bye, AMI. - Good-bye, friend. [dramatic music] - [yells] ♪ ♪ [grunting] [confused chatter] - Ha ha! It worked! - We did it! [chuckles] Oh. - Oh. [chuckles] Ah. [nervous chuckle] - [chuckles] - Carol is gonna be so mad. - I got your messages. [dramatic music] - Captain Marvel, how-- how long have you been here? - Not long. What I thought was a galactic distress call turned out to be a wild goose chase to Titan. Must have been Hala trying to get me out of the way. I got back just in time to see you didn't really need an assist anymore. Looks like I left the right person in charge. - But I made so many mistakes. - You kept your cool, called for backup, and didn't give up. You're still learning, but if Hala underestimates your team again, she'll be in for a surprise. - I'm sorry, AMI. - [squeaks] - We're sorry too. - Thank you. I just-- I don't know what I'm going to do without her. - Well, whatever you do, we don't have to do it alone, right? I mean, you can if you want, but after everything you've been through, it would be a shame to lose heart now. - My heart's not lost, just a bit broken. - Well, when you're ready. If you want a friend, you know where to find us. [dark music] - I'm just saying, why do super villains always dump their malfunctioning doomsday devices in New Jersey? It's so not cool. - Intel was good. Two cameras by the door. We have to disable them both. - Cameras disabled. Next? [dramatic music] - Oh, you changed the suit. - Yeah. Got the idea from a friend. - You know, if you're going to be a superhero, you need a superhero name. Girl of Iron? Iron Lass? Oh, I know, I know. - Call me Ironheart. - Okay. Ironheart, stick with Squirrel Girl. We hit the main doors on three. Everyone ready? One, two, three. [all yelling] - ♪ Team ♪
