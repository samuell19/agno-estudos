(rain and thunder) (crowd chatters) Ah Innkeeper, what fare can you offer a hungry traveler on this most unsavory of evenings? Well sir I can offer you an excellent mutton pie and carrots and there's some corned beef and cabbage, finally some fish what I caught down at the bay this very morning served atop a bed of chip and fried pOtatoes. Splendid I think I will dine upon the fish. Show me to my table and bring me a jug of ale thank you. There be no tables sir, my inn is full. No room say? (crowd stops talking) Well sir I think you need to broaden your thinking. Sir, hand me your gazette. Innkeeper I put it to you that you cook my serve of fish and chip and potatoes and that you then wrap them tightly in this paper. So that I may take my evening repass from this place of misery and consume them contentedly elsewhere. So sir wishes to take the food away? Take away, yes indeed. Take away. Man: What a splendid idea. (crowd chatters) Woman: There be your takeaway sir. (thunder clapping) Innkeeper. What treachery is this? You have deigned to serve me a mouse served in Axle grease? I will have your hide for insolence Innkeeper. That be no mouse sir, that be a delicacy from the far east they call them Dim Sims. It's delicious, that is delicious. Man: I want one. Man: Me too. Man: Can you steam one for me? Woman: Have you got any soy sauce? Better check the traps.

Voice On TV: You know what? ♪ If you're feeling really blue ♪ ♪ And you don't know what to do ♪ ♪ Get a burger into you ♪ ♪ A Bergies burger into you ♪ ♪ A Burgies burger into you. ♪ What did you do that for? That stuff's crap that's why. Well you obviously haven't tried their onion rings. Mate don't come the onion ring with me all right? When that Burgies opens up down the street this place is stuffed. More stuffed. Well it's definitely not my fault hey? What about that watch? Hey? Oh I won it. Well actually I won one of those four wheel drives but they reckon I cheated so they gave me a Freddie Fry watch instead. Trevor: Yeah that'd be right. Yeah well why don't you do something about it then? Oh yeah right, who am I? I'm just a bloke that owns a fish and chip shop I'm nothin', I'm nobody. Don't say that mate, you're somebody. You're Trev from Trev's Fish and Chips. Mate I'm not even the Trev in Trev's Fish and Chips. That's me old man Big Trev. I'm little Trev. Oh well everyone seems to really like ya and hey, people travel for miles for one of your burgers. Mate, my old man showed me how to make a burger when I was 12 right? And we make 'em exactly the same way ever since all I do is I follow that bit of paper I showed you next to the grill. What happened to Big Trev? Well he died. Right there where you're standing now, holding that egg flip. (sighs) What like a heart attack or something? Yeah well he had a heart attack yeah. That's not what killed him though. Falling into the chip fryer's what pretty much knocked him off. Jesus. I suppose I should change that oil. Fuck. Dave, Dave. Yeah. I'm joking mate. (sighing) yeah he was dead before he hit the oil. Of course it will affect business. How? I run a good clean honest business providing quality food. My beef is 100% beef, my fish is 100% fish, my Dim Sims are 100% Dim Sims. Yeah but they've got a lot more money than you... Sonja they're just another competitor and a pretty good one at that. Believe it or not I've researched some of their marketing techniques and adapted them to my own corporate strategies. (laughing) corporate strategies Tony what are you talking about? This is your dad's fish and chip shop. Was my dad's fish and chip shop he held me back, he wanted to do things the old fashioned way. Back then there were no tables and chairs out the front, there was no cappuccino machine, no salads, he didn't even sell Diet Coke. This is my shop now Sonja, all mine. I'm sorry I said anything. Good, now there's fish to be fileted. Firstly they're called crew members they're not staff. And secondly they don't need a car park because their fathers drop them off. Now when do I serve my first burger? Mid size outlet like this, put in the plumbing, lay the slab and the rest is prefabricated. Piece of piss. Burgies Manager: I look forward to viewing the masterpiece upon it's completion. Well that's us rooted. No, no, a lot more traffic, people are gonna park their cars, they're gonna get out, they're gonna smell Tony's fish, they're gonna smell Tony;s chips, they're gonna come and get some. Tony you are actually pulling yourself now right because they're gonna have a drive through, right? Most of 'em aren't even gonna get out of their cars. This is a dream for me Tarquin.

No Sandra that's okay that'd Barry Burgie the burgerlicious clown and his little friend Freddy the Friendly Fry. How are ya fellas? Trevor: Can't complain. We are not the burgalicious clown and his friendly fry. Really? You coulda fooled me. Ha, you're not at all are ya? Mr Burgie, my name is Tony and this is my friend Trevor. Hi. We're businessmen like yourself. I could tell you were management material the moment you walked through the door. Yes well I do own a medium sized food outlet. Ever thought of a career with Burgies? Well our business is take away food. And therein lies our problem. Our problem, oh, do tell. Well you see Mr Burgie, we both own fish and chip shops very near in fact in my case right next door to a site where you propose to put a new Burgies. Oh gosh that's awful. Exactly, and while I welcome the healthy competition that a Burgies outlet would offer my extensive knowledge of the area indicates that the community probably can't sustain three take away food outlets. So in summary we think that you should not open that Burgies. Is that is? Thank you. Done. Sandra can you cancel the building of our latest outlet at, where is it? 4-6-2 Reserve Road. 462 Reserve Road, actually Sandra can you cancel all new Burgies currently under construction in Australia? No make that the world. And while you're at it close down all the existing ones as well. You're taking the piss aren't ya? By golly you're quick. Just a moment boys, just before you show our entrepreneurs the door I want to tell them a little story. A little story that started about 200 million years ago when the first slug crawled out of the primordial filth and up onto the shore of a dark and hostile world. That slug was driven by one simple urge, one overriding impulse, survival. It wanted to live, to procreate, to exercise it's right to quiet enjoyment. Do you know what happened to that brave, noble little slug gentlemen? It got eaten by a bigger slug. And we here at Burgies are the bigger slug and we will always be that bigger slug. Gentlemen consider yourself digested. (slurping) You coulda just told us to fuck off. Get out then. I'll take you on you multinational bastard. Leave me alone. Tony: If I had my overhead projector things would have turned out differently. Trevor: Bullshit. Tony: And if you hadn't have left our luggage by the side of the road I wouldn't be sitting here in this ridiculous costume. Trevor: How was I supposed to know there's thieves in Sydney? You shouldn't have resorted to violence Trevor. Bull crap. And you shouldn't have drank so much on the plane. It was free. It's not free I paid for it. Trevor: Bullshit. Tony: Bullshit you. Trevor: That is bullshit. Tony: Bullshit. (carnival music) Burgies bad, Burgies bad, Burgies bad. (crowd yelling) Crowd: Bad Burgies, bad Burgies, Bad Burgies Burgies is bad, Burgies is bad Burgies is bad. Look everybody, it's Barry Burgie the burgerlicious clown and his little friend Freddy the Friendly Fry. Barry Burgie and Freddy Fry it is wonderful to have you both here isn't it children? (laughing) Crowd: Burgies is bad, Burgies is gross. (vomiting) Dirty dirty clown. And you can go fuck yourselves. Cover your ears children don't listen to that rude naughty fry. No sir. Oi oi, you wrecked my mate's business you should be a-bloody-shamed of yourself. Trevor: Ken. Tony, what are you doing? Tony you mad man. How do you know me name? Sonja: Get off him, get off him, Tony, you okay? Trev? (sparkly sounds) (train horn) Hello, hello everybody, hello boys and girls I'm Barry Burgie. And I'm Freddy the Friendly Fry. Look everyone, it's Trev formerly of Trev's Fish and Chips. He's just in time to try Burgies new product, Dim Sim on a stick. Distant Voice: Dim Sim on a stick, Dim Sim on a stick you can get it quick, it will make you sick. (evil laughing) No. Trev, Trev? Oh Trev. I just had the worst nightmare. You'll be okay. Oh they made me second in charge of nuggets. No. Crowd: Burgies is crap, Burgies is crap, Burgies is crap. (mechanical whirring) Man: Welcome to the Burgies drive through may I take your order please? (Burgies sounds in distance) (fly buzzes) Man: Good afternoon Ma'am welcome to Burgies drive through may I take your order? (pinball machine plays) Sorry about yesterday mate. Un-bloody-forgivable. That's all right mate your heart was in the right place. Yeah well. Spoken with young Dave yet? (slams paper down) No. (fly buzzes) (fly swat hits table) (pinball machine plays) I hate that Fry mate. Yeah me too mate. I mean they're not fries anyway they're bloody chips. Too-bloody-right. In fact I've got a good mind to go down there right now order some bloody chips. You should bloody do that. That'd show 'em wouldn't it? Oh yeah. Yeah, that'd show 'em. And they always say do you want fries with that. I mean mate if I'd have wanted fries with that I would have bloody asked for them. (fly swat hits table) You're really starting to get me down now mate. Sorry mate. Nah it's all right. (girl laughing) (drink slurping) Man: Here's your Burgie bag. Geez it's busy out there isn't it? Just shut up. Man: Welcome to Burgies drive through may I take your order? (crowd chatters) Can I get a dozen bulk burgers Man: 10 seconds on those cheeseburgers Jeremy. Man: Burgie little burgers. If the finger's up the nose it can't be making burgers can it? You can't cook the nugget until you know the nugget. You can't know the nugget until you respect the nugget. I know nuggets. No David you think you know nuggets. Christ Jenny. You know jack shit about nuggets. More cheese, less chatter. Sir we've lost Mandy Wilson to a netball semi final and it looks like little Bobby Fletcher's got a bad case of eczema on his hands. Put Bobby on wrapping out the back, call Mandy Wilson's parents and tell them that their daughter needn't bother coming in on the weekend. Sir, she's crew member of the month. I don't care. There's no room for sentiment we're making hamburgers. (mechanical whirring) Sonja the photographer'll be here soon to take photos for the new color fridge magnets so I want the place to look spotless. New color fridge magnets? That's really gonna help Tony. Not just fridge magnets, Mr Blowy. (knocking on glass) Your traitor boyfriend's here. You tell him if he comes in here I'll kill him. He's not my boyfriend. Just get rid of him. (bell dings) Hi. Dave just go away. I'd like to talk to you. Well I think it's a bit late for that. Oh, I'm sorry. What about Trevor, how do you think he feels? I couldn't help it. I was sucked in by the glamor. The glamor? Yeah, the glamor, you know the uniform and the song, the free nuggets. Well those things are obviously more important to you than Trevor and the shop and your job and me and Tony and... everything right? Look I'd better go 'cause my five minute lunch break's almost over. (door bell dings) (Burgies drive through sounds in distance) Forget about him, you're too good for him. Have you spoken to Trevor yet? Stop mentioning that name to me he brings me nothing but misery. Oh well that sounds reasonable. Sonja if it wasn't for him... what? He didn't do any of this, he didn't build that place next door. He's an idiot. His father would be turning in his grave if he could see what's happening. What has his father got to do with this? Nothing, don't worry about it. Uncle Nick and Trev's dad were friends. They used to be in business together. Sonja mind your own business. Look... That's Uncle Mick with Trev's dad isn't it? Yeah. They used to run a fish and chip shop together didn't they? Yeah next door where the butcher is now. Did quite well. So what happened? I don't know. Oh you must, what started as one fish and chip shop ended as two fish and chip shops. Sonja this is none of your business. Oh come on Tony just tell me what it was about. Pineapple. Pineapple? Big Trev reckoned that a hamburger with the lot meant the usual plus egg, bacon and pineapple. My dad reckoned that pineapple, like beetroot was an added extra and that the customer should pay 10 cents more. So your dad and Trev's dad had the falling out over a 10 cent piece of pineapple? Yeah, my dad was really stubborn. Big Trevor he was very serious about his hamburgers. So they went their separate ways. What do you think Uncle Nick would have done about the Burgies? I don't know, probably just ignored it. Which is exactly what you're doing. Yeah? But what about the fridge magnets? Hey? That oughta keep them on their toes. And Mr Blowy. Man: Bacon burger. (crowd chatters) Louisa, when the uniform is neat the customers repeat. (funky music) In front of the big fish, this is for the fridge magnet okay? Oh Mal, what's going on? Oh mate I'm off there's no money in this caper. People just go to the supermarket to get their meat these days. So what are you gonna do? Got a job in the supermarket, see ya. All right, you can get this? Yeah. Yeah. Amanda get those fries on. Jerry... Jerry I don't care if it is your sisters wedding double shift in the nugget pit on Saturday. But I was supposed to be the Paige boy. I don't care. (funky music) No, no, no, no Jim you don't understand I want to see the whole thing. I want to see Tony's I want to see the fish, all right? And if you can, try and get Mr Blowy in the shoot. Not him too. People have got to know it's my shop. Yeah, okay? Does the top of it look all right? (camera shutters) Trevor what are you doing? You walked in front of my shot. Sorry Jim. You're a dickhead. (crowd chatters) (knock on door) Trouble sir. ( grunting happily) Mate I asked for chips and they gave me these fries and I said they're not chips and there must've been drugs in it or something 'cause I couldn't stop eating them. Beef nugget. Burgies Manager: Welcome to Burgies sir may I take your order? You bastard you ripped me off. Well if sir has a complaint we invite him to use the suggestion box. You stole my idea I invented beef nuggets. So sir has the patent on the recipe and registered the name? Uh no. No, no, no, then perhaps sir stole Burgies' idea. You thieving little mongrel. Sir must have a very good lawyer if sir wants to go around making those sort of accusations. You lot ought to be ashamed of yourselves. All of ya's. Yeah. Food fight. (crowd cheers) Take a photo of me looking confident and looking happy, happy this time. Jim: Okay. Don't be shy. I know what I'm doing. Trevor you blocked in front of my shot again. Go around the camera. You listen here right, we have tried it your way, we have tried it Sonja's way now we're gonna try it my way, my place tonight 10:00 and you too. All right, all right, all right. Mate I've got mixed netball at 9:00. Move, move. Ken: I'll be there. Sorry now they've upset me hang on hang on, just wait for me to get happy again. Anthony Rob... (camera shutters) Jim wait a bit. Jim: Sorry. (train crossing bell) And that'll be that. What do you say? Yeah. That has to be the dumbest plan I've ever heard. Bullshit, Trev you're a fucking mastermind that is the best plan I've heard in donkey's years mate. How many plans have you heard lately? What are you a professional jewel thief now or something? Are you part on an international drug ring, huh? No mate I'm a tow truck driver and believe you me, we know plans. What's it to ya anyway Ken? Now listen here Tony I was a mate of Big Trev's and I'm a mate of Little Trev's and I was a mate of your old man. If you just relaxed a little bit I'd be a mate of yours too. Okay okay Mr Clever Plan Dick how are we gonna get in? Yeah how are we gonna get in? Well we got someone on the inside. Oh. What? Let's just call him a disgruntled employee Who is it Trev? Look I can't say all right. This individual has agreed to help us on the condition of strict anonymity. Well how do we know we can trust him? Oh you can trust me Tony. Mate you're supposed to disguise your voice. Shit sorry. Hey good on ya Dave. Yeah thanks Ken. Christs sake Dave, disguise your voice. I keep forgetting. So you finally decided to do the right thing? Yeah, um, how's Sonja? Look will ya shut up, listen, nobody knows who this bloke is. All right? Yeah okay. All right. No worries. Just get over here. (crashing) Don't do that. This is a bloody joke. I'm outta here. All right Ton, always knew I'd be able to rely on you mate. What you're planning here is highly illegal. Mate it's just us right. No one else needs to know about it. Now are you in or not? You know what mate, you'd probably fit in over there. With your nice hair cut, they'd give you a nice uniform with some badges for sucking up to the customers. You know you even play your cards right you might even get some little kids to boss around. Bullshit. No you're bullshit. No bull shit you mate. You know fellas you do not have to go through with any of this. Coming up with these beef nuggets, I like them. All right boys it's almost action stations. Alright. Right. Right. Right, so we should probably synchronize watches. Uh yeah okay. Mine broke. What time you got? 6:30. 6:30, 6:30. Tarquin: You showed the neighbors a thing or two today sir. I Did didn't I? Better make the most of it they'll be gone soon. Losers. (laughing) Trevor: Now remember you blokes complete silence. Ken: Ow crikey Dave. Dave where's the key? It's one of these. Just hurry up. They look the same. Shut up. Stop making so much noise. Sorry. (glass smashes) Ta-da. What are you doing? I'm sorry mate I thought you wanted to get in. Here we go. What? Ken: Give me your torch. Dave: I told you I'd get you in man. (footsteps on glass) Trevor: Quiet you two. (spitting in bag) Hey kids it's Barry Burger the burgerlicious clown. Cut it out stop rooting around this is serious. It's funny. No it's not funny. Hey did we want the lights on? No you idiot turn them off. Dave: Sorry. Ken: Surrounded by bloody morons. Can I take your order please? Oh, oh rubbish. (cat meowing) (drink pouring) Sh, what's that noise? I'm so thirsty. Hey can I have a Fanta? Mm-hmm (affirmative) Cool. (slurping) You see mate Fanta is just as refreshing as Coke and it's good for you. What? Well it's got oranges in it hasn't it? There are no oranges in there. Hey you two shut up and help. I'm telling you there's oranges in there. Get your mind on the job. Oh, sorry. Ken: I'm telling you oranges. Trevor: Help me over here. Trevor: Dave. Dave: Yeah. Trevor: Pull that chain. Trevor: Kenny. Dave: Ken. Ken: Shit a brick Trevor. (sighs) Hey are we covered by Workcover? Hey you right mate? Not flash. Gotta lift from the knees fellas. G'day Tony. What are you doing here? Thought you might need a hand. So you're gonna help out now are ya? The food they're serving in there is not fit for human consumption. It's good to have you on board. No worries Trevor. (Ken grunting) You love each other, that's terrific but I can't feel my legs. Ken. Hm? Ken. Oh shit, come this way this way. Tony: You're gonna make it, you're gonna just.
