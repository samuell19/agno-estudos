Sylvia, I know now's not a good time, but... Yeah? We should talk. We will, but not now. Okay. The signal is still active, so... we're good to go. Madsen, Tanner, listen up. According to our intel, the house is empty. The Titov family left this afternoon. The house next door is on the market, and also without residents. But still proceed with caution. Almost there. Is this your first holiday break-in? Nah. This is just a regular weekend break-in. It's not Christmas yet. Signal is green. You're good to go. Cyber crime pays pretty well, huh? - Nice house. - Mm-hmm. Unlocking. Okay, we're in. Look at that. Money can't buy you style. Shut up. Agents are proceeding to the second floor. You need to manually scan to pinpoint the correct device. -Signal is green. -That's the one. Take it and leave. Please, don't... Stay on the floor. I'm not gonna hurt you. Hey, hey, hey! The house is not empty. There's a child in one of these bedrooms. Movement, four Tangos, on foot. Next door. Send the car. Fifteen seconds. Alarm has activated. Get out of there now. Almost done. Oh, my God, I, I shot a child. I shot a child. Additional movement inside the house. - Come on! - We need to get them out of there now. - Come on, breathe. - We have to go. Leave him! -Stay out! -Sylvia, we have to go! Come on! Evacuate via the north balcony. Tanner, Madsen, report! Is the computer traveling with you? Affirmative. How the fuck did that just happen? It was not your fault. I don't care who's fucking fault it was. I shot a kid. A fucking kid. I shot a kid. It was not your fault. The boy agent Madsen shot dead was Leonid Titov's son, Yuri. Sylvia Madsen is not to blame. It was my responsibility. I'm not laying blame. I just need to make sure the Swedes get opportunities to analyze her. Political correctness is imperative on this matter. Everything must go by the book. We have Titov's computer. His son used to play online. Once our people crack it, we expect definite proof against Titov. Money laundering, disinformation campaigns, etcetera. But we can't use any of that now. The incident has been reported as a burglary-homicide. We're denying all EU involvement. And unofficially? Well, Titov still has a lot of pull in Russia. He's protected. - Okay. - I have some housekeeping to do here. And you will go back to Finland. For now. Anything else? No. You're saying she made a mistake during the operation. - No. - -And after this incidence, would you work with Sylvia Madsen again? Yes, I would. Hmm. Hey, Sylvia... just wanted to call you. Call me back... when you get this. Vasa? My name is Anya. How did you find me? - What do you want? - I'm a lawyer, and I have a proposition for you. - So... - I know you're in financial trouble. How did you know that? I can help you. How? Your father is Colonel Borislav Jankovic. - Yes? - Yeah. I know he was wrongfully accused. Sentenced to prison. And the EU is writing your country's history to their favor at the same time. It's very sad. My employer offers you the opportunity to... make it up to your father. And also become extremely wealthy. I am not a mercenary and I'm not a criminal. There are lots of good men like that still loyal to your father and also to your late brother. They will help. Think about it. How wealthy? Astronomically. General Morel has recently approached EU leaders, with a proposal that the EU should tighten its economic sanctions against Russia, if Russia does not stop protecting cyberattacks, and this information... General Morel is a somewhat controversial figure right now. So he needs protection for his trip to Finland. He is in very good terms with your president. They're old friends. But given your country's special relationship with Russia, I predict some political turmoil on the horizon. Should we arrange a security detail for him? Not necessary. We'll do it... Discreetly, under the radar. I already have someone perfect for the job. Hey, it's Sylvia. Hey there. I'm sorry, I haven't called. Yeah, don't worry about it. It was pretty... tough after everything that happened. Yeah, I know. How are you feeling now? Well, I'm, I'm back at work. And I'm coming to Helsinki. - Oh! - Yeah, I'll be there for a couple of days. Will, will you have time to say hello? I'd like that. Maybe we can... do something fun. Yeah. Yeah. And it was a good shot too. I'm just going to wear my suit. A black suit. So you wanna look like his bodyguard? I am his bodyguard! - That's all you are? - Yeah. - Just a bodyguard? - Mm-mm. Nothing else? No. Is Morel dirty? I haven't said anything. I'm just his bodyguard. - I take that as a yes. - Mm-hmm. Shh! Okay. - Ugh! - Okay. - Um... - So it's my turn. Oh damn. Why haven't you started a family? Settle down, raise a couple of kids... Maybe I haven't found the right person to start a family with. Is there a right person? Yeah, there is. But... it's impossible. Okay. How's Stefan? He's fine. Home with the kids alone, again. So, this is me. Are you coming? You still haven't said what you wanted to say. I know. It's good that I'm here for another night then. Finnish Independence Day is celebrated on the 6th of December. The celebrations are preceded by a ritual greeting of esteemed guest. This year, there will be a significant number of diplomats and cultural representatives, among the invited guests. The official celebrations of Finland's Independence Day began this morning when the Finnish flag was raised at Helsinki's TÃ¤htitorninmaki. The president of Finland began his day with the laying of wreath at the graves of heroes of World War II and the grave of Marshal Mannerheim. The presidential couple's day continues with the traditional festive service at the Helsinki's cathedral. Finland became independent in 1917. The Republic of Finland is a member of EU and has been active both in the United... Good evening, sir. Would you like a drink? I just opened a bottle of champagne. Well, I guess one glass won't hurt. Thank you. Cheers. The republic of Finland gained its independence from Russia back in 1917 and is today a strong member of the EU. Though some would argue that its shared border with Russia explains why Finland has yet to join NATO. But today is a day of celebration for the Finns. Behind me, the Presidential Palace is now filling with distinguished luminaries, diplomats and royalty. A hugely popular pastime for the general public will be watching the live broadcast from the palace and gossiping about who's wearing what and with whom. Empress to Omerta, do you read? I read you. Go ahead, Empress. Gatecrasher is in place... 17 minutes. Copy, 17. It was an important decision. You have a large airspace. - It must be defended. - Yes. Finland's role has always been important... - Yeah. - For Europe and the UN. Yeah. The process has been, has been challenging. Especially concerning the HX fighter program. It's our strategy against hybrid warfare. - Cheers. - Cheers. Sylvia? O? Three minutes. Gatecrasher is ready to go. Activating signal distortion. Drop your weapons! Face the wall! Hand on your head! Nobody moves! Stay down! Get down! Get down! Gun on the floor. Put the gun down! Down! Down! On the floor! On the floor. Step one completed. Stay down! I'm speaking to you from the main hall. Stay down, stay on the floor and be calm. Phone service is down. Data is down. We have control. Everybody stay on the ground. Do not do something stupid. Don't move. Get over here! Nobody move! All doors are equipped with explosives. So don't try to run. That goes for every room. Stay on the floor and be calm. We're gonna dim the lights. Stay down. We have control. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Mr. President. Get up. Move. Move! Omerta, report. Doors secured. Move, outside. Move. Out. Move! Left. Go up! Up! Put him through. Um, it's Peter Nylund from Helsinki. Our Presidential Palace... is under armed attack. O, have you located the target? No. No, not yet. Find him. General Morel... please show yourself. Save us some time. You definitely don't want us to start shooting people. I'm going to execute hostages. I'm here. Move. Who's this? She's my date. She's your date? Take her too. She's part of the package. We will need her later. Move. Sit down. Hands. This is Lieutenant Marcus Tanner here. Who am I speaking with? Are you in charge? I'm the negotiator. Who's this? This is Vasa Jankovic. We've heard some gunshots. Is everybody okay there? Well, we didn't come to harm anyone. How's the president? He's good. And everybody else? They're good. I would like you to send us some proof that everybody's okay. Can you do that for me? First, I wanna give you a little gift. The call is disconnected. Everybody up. Now! Come on, come on. Faster. Move! Let's go! Move! Move, move, move! Step two completed. Good. Proceed as planned. This is Tanner speaking. We will not be releasing any more guests at this time. Is our president still with you? Yeah, he's still here. He's here among, um... yeah, let's say, uh, a group of special people. We will keep them. So what are your demands? My demands are... number one... the liberation of my father... Borislav Jankovic. I want him transported here in a helicopter. Number two, a private plane... fueled and ready to fly at Malmi airport. Number three... I need a person capable of moving cryptocurrencies, available to me in not more than 30 minutes. Then I will give you more instructions later. About 1300 guests... We've looked into that DDoS attack. There were thousands of computers in that botnet. Professional stuff. This strike seems to be backed with big money. They must be after something specific. Sylvia Madsen is still inside with general Morel. She can handle herself. She's not just Morel's bodyguard, is she? No, it's a cover to observe and investigate Morel. - Why? - That's classified. Now I want you to join an intelligence briefing with me and the Finnish authority. Yes, ma'am. Borislav Jankovic was convicted in Hague, and has served his sentence in Sweden and now here in Finland. Vasa is he's only surviving son. Jankovic has been imprisoned for years, but this is not just about him. General Morel was leader in an operation to catch and convict Jankovic. Morel is pro-NATO and promotes tighter sanctions against Russia. - Moscow. - -Cyberattacks are a strong indication of that. I gotta go. I assume my demands are being delivered. Vasa, you have people there who run my country. I need to know everybody's alive and well. After that, we can discuss releasing your father. Did you notice I just released several hundred people? Yes I did, but I still need proof of life. Especially of the President of Finland. - You'll get it. - No, I need it now. Don't tell me what to do. Could you please prove it to me right now? He needs to know you're okay. Satisfied? Yes, for now. You really think your father was wrongly prosecuted? Let's talk about my money. You don't think he was a war criminal? I want a hundred million euros in bitcoins. - A hundred million? - Yes. Vasa, I'm sure you understand... I don't really have access to that kind of money right away. Well, I'm sure your Ministry of Finance will find a solution. Let's just talk about this. No, this is non-negotiable. The call is disconnected. Empress. Omerta. Step three completed. Good. We'll see if they're good for it. Put these on. Get up. Can I get some water? No. I need to go to the bathroom. Shut the fuck up, sit down. You, up. Up! Give me your hands. Sit down. I have a question, Mr. President. Why did you support the illegal war in Kosovo? You were a part of it. You were responsible. - We had to agree with more powerful European nations... - Right. Right, EU countries. So you want Finland to be a part of NATO? That's not my decision. Do you know my mother was killed in Kosovo? In a humanitarian strike. Did you know that? June, 1999. Broad daylight, 70 people dead. Put your mask on. Your father has landed. - Good. And a plane is ready at the Malmi airport. And the money? Your funds are transferring as we speak. - Okay. - We had an agreement. We need you to release the hostages. You just have to trust me. It's all here. We're moving. I have some new instructions for you. Listen to me carefully. The plan has changed. I want you to kill him. You understand? O, watch out. Movement on the roof. Move! Move, move. - Come on. - Move, move. Faster, go, go, go, move! Move. Now! The other stairs third floor service elevator. Omerta, go to plan B. Masks! We move. Go! Go, go, go. Keep going. Let's get this plane ready. We need to be in air in five minutes. Get into the plane! Now! Hurry up. Stop. Keep your hands so that I can see them. Keep your hands so that I can see them. Where are you? We're on our way to the landing zone. The target is down. You did good. Proceed to destination. Shut up. This is where I want you to land. Set the course. Vasa. Get this plane in the air, now. They're flying in the dark with the transponder off. Oscar Hotel Whiskey India X-ray is leaving Finnish airspace, uh, to Russian airspace, St. Petersburg control area. Okay, we can continue. A NATO AWACS plane has been tracking the Falcon. It's on vector to go into Belarus airspace in a matter of minutes. Belarus? So is Titov behind this? It looks like it, yes. And Moscow's backing him up. Vasa Jankovic wanted to save his father, but I'm sure someone else ordered the murder of your president. There's one of our guys on the plane. I need to use the bathroom. Okay, hands up. Police! Sit down! Ah. We're landing in eight minutes. We know the abductor's destination. It's an old industrial complex that used to house a troll factory during the Brexit referendum. Now this part of Belarus is unstable. It doesn't have a reliable regime. I can't get involved officially. There's no way I can send a strike team over the border into Belarus. We have an agent and a top general there. You put Sylvia into this position, and I need to get her out. Yes, and all I can provide is satellite surveillance and extraction from the border. No one to get me over? I have Jonesy and Sinclair. - Those two mercenaries. - They were part of a black op against the BS factory. The operation never happened. But they do know the way around the area. The unconfirmed number of casualties is seven at this stage. Okay, Tanner. We're approaching the border of Lithuania and Belarus. Prepare for landing. What's the craic, Tanner? Jonesy, Sinclair. - How are you? - You're late. This one's not gonna be an easy money job, okay? Yeah, I'm used to it. I'm Irish. Plug my hole, Tanner. We're currently five klicks from the border. -There's way to sneak in by the old riverbed, but... it's tricky. After that, you're on your own. All right, let's move. Loaded and ready. The gas. Vasa Jankovic! Finally we meet. Vasa. Leonid Titov. You must be very tired? Interesting times. I'm very sorry about your father. And I'm very sorry about this... I'm like Darth Vader. I'm changing the deal. Tanner, do you read me? - I read you, go ahead. - Good. We have you on satellite. Aerial surveillance shows at least three casualties on the ground. Yeah, we heard the shots. Anything else? They have backup generators, so it's no use taking it of the power grid. You'll have to sneak in and improvise. Yeah. Omerta. You have performed extremely well in Finland. Cheer up. Okay? Show me the gifts you brought. Hmm. And how are you... Agent Madsen? She's, uh, a part of European special police force. See the bridge? Yeah. The guards patrol it. See the sewers on the other side? That will take you straight to the perimeter and the compound. You're on your own, son. Thanks a million. Anytime. You'll be fine, Tanner. Finland never wins... but neither loses. We've locked on to agent Tanner's tracking signal. There's no need to be so grumpy. And now I'm very sorry, but I need to borrow your retina for a moment. Hmm. Thank you for your donation. And keep it straight. You understand... that I can't be associated with terrorist. Tanner, you popped up on our screen again. Proceed through the doorway, step at the wall. General Morel! Are you ready for the statement of your life? This is the place where you're going to declare the whole world that you have been part of a group of ultra-right officers, financed by Moscow. Fuck you. We had a deal, Jean. You can fuck over warlords, dealers, hackers... but you can't fuck over hardline business man. Elena? Cross the inner courtyard heading northwest. -The troll factory is located at... Now, the server is in the renovated quarters at the far end of the courtyard. Based on our intel... My name is General Jean Morel. What I am about to tell you is going to be denied by the leaders of the EU. But I swear to you... it's true. Tanner, do you read me? Visual on Vasa Jankovic. Do not expose yourself. Your mission is to save Morel. Tanner... do you read me? Tanner! We made a deal. You broke it. Back off! Back off! Where are they? Next building. Who helped you? Who helped you in Helsinki? Russians. You're gonna shoot me? Stay out of my way. Your turn... Agent Madsen. It was your son, the boy in Tallinn? Yes. It was my Yuri. Media reported that he was killed by thieving junkies. Are you a thieving junkie... agent Madsen? I'm sorry about your loss. Yeah. You were just doing your job, huh? Correct. Your job now is to tell the whole world who is responsible. And I want all names, agent Madsen. All EU officials who are responsible of killing children. Read the text... and your children will be not harmed. I promise you. From parent to parent. Read the text. Get the gun! Let's go! Take a jacket! Hurry! Come! Take cover! Sylvia Madsen, code 612. Request is from pinpoint location. And an immediate air support. Okay, you go that way. Tweet this. Massive data disruption detected in conjunction with several explosions. It's Sylvia Madsen. She's on the roof. Call in the chopper. Take cover, take cover. That side. Hide over there. Sylvia! Sylvia! Tanner, over here. He's one of us. What a surprise. It's good to see you. Good to see you. I'm guessing you had something to do with the explosion. Yeah, I might have. The chopper has entered Belarusian airspace, flying at 300 feet. Ghost 1, emergency evacuation... Landing zone Bravo. Ghost 1, going in landing zone Bravo. Tanner, give them a smoke signal. Chopper inbound, east side. Intercept estimated 20 seconds. Landing zone is too hot. Several Tangos on the roof. Smoke! Cover up! - Go, go, go, go. - Go! Come on, let's go! Do we have the General? Primary objective secured. Come on, Tanner! Heavy fire. Go! Go! Wait. Don't leave him! Let's circle back. Hold tight, I'm gonna circle back. Warning, incoming. Flares fired. One more agent is on the roof. Leave him. Ghost 1, abort mission. Return to base. Huh? Whoa. Anya. Let's take a walk. I knew somebody was gonna come. I'm just surprised it's you. I was the one who recruited you. And now you've come to get rid of me. Yes. I probably deserve it. I have some friends in Buenos Aires. They'll take care of you. Am I still gonna get astronomically rich? No. But you'll get by. Have a good life. Max. Well, this is a surprise. It's good to see you. You want... to know what happened in Belarus. Why did I leave you behind? Well, Tanner, we're both professionals. We both have to do what it takes to accomplish our missions. My job is to give orders. Your job is to follow them. Why did they kill our president? Your president shapes Finnish opinions. And he was making preparations for Finland to join NATO. The powers behind Titov wanted to delay this in any way possible. Titov got away. We'll get him eventually. And Vasa Jankovic? Once used, he was expendable. So, Tanner... you're ready to get back to work? I know now is not a good time, but... we need to talk. Well, Max Tanner... nothing is impossible.
