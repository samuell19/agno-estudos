[Piano music] [Clarinet and piano music] [Piano music] [Bipping signaling car problems] - Shit! - Hey, saw smoke coming out of the engine back there What's the problem? - Car's just overheated - Oh, sorry to hear it Do you need a hand? - I'm good - No, really. I'd be happy to take a look Let's see what we can do and get you back on the road. - Yeah, sure. - We'll have it fixed in no time Well... what we got here? Looks like you're running low on coolant. Do you have any? - Uh, no. - I've got some. Hold tight. Here - Great. - Don't! Don't touch the cap, it's hot. You're gonna need a rag or something. - Right, yeah, hum... I think I have one in the trunk somewhere. - So, where are you headed? - Hmm Ridgefield - Oh yeah, what for? - I'm gonna work in my family store - Say, is it that Supermarket on East Madison? I know it's a local family business. I hear it's a chain now. - Nope. Just the one liquor store. It's my parents place - Oh, I see Hold on a minute... Nathan? Is that you? - Yep, it's me. - Oh, what are the odds of that. Why didn't you say anything? - I didn't think you'd remember me. - Of course I remember you. How could I forget you? You always sat under the clock and played clarinet. How long has it been now? Four years? - Six, I think. - It's really been six years already? Oh, time sure does fly. Hold there! Hold your horses. You gotta pull down on that tab there if you're gonna open the cap - Right - So, what have you been up to lately? - I... uh...did as a data analyst for Edgewell. - Edgewell that's that... hmm... healthcare firm, right? - Yeah, that's the one - So, why are you heading back home for? - I quit Like I said I'm gonna work for my parents. - Careful, hmm... be sure not to get any on the manifold. - I got it - Well... what about music? - What about it? - You had a particular knack for it. I always thought you might be the one kid to... actually pursue it after taking my class. Did it ever cross your mind? Pursuing music in New York? - Yeah - Well... then why didn't you take band's senior year? I missed having you on clarinet. - I mean, White played clarinet, right? - White? Yeah, so he played it but he didn't play it, not like you did at least. Hmm, Nathan it'd probably be a heck of a lot better if we waited for it to cool off a bit before putting the cap back on - Okay - So, why didn't you take band again? - Well, I didn't think I was that good. - What? Well then, what made you think that? - You did. I just never felt good enough in your class. I guess. - Did I do something to upset you? - Well, it didn't help when you embarrassed me in front of everyone. Wrong key, wrong tempo, watch your posture all the time. I mean, it was humiliating. - I never did that to... embarrass you. Jesus Nathan, I thought you understood that. - I just never got why it was only me. Everyone else got off easy - You were so dedicated. I thought you'd appreciate the advice. Everyone else couldn't care less. They didn't get it like you did. - Just made me feel like everyone else was better so... why try? - Well, it seems to me that you gave up before you could even find out. I gave you critique so you could improve, so you could get ahead. You had the most potential out of anyone by a long shot I thought maybe one day I'd see you up on a stage somewhere, New York City, Big Apple playing to your heart's content. I was only ever hard on you because I thought that extra push could get you there to win something that really made you happy. - You really thought that about me? - Absolutely - Thanks Mr. Richmond - Ah please, call me Lawrence You're not a kid anymore - Sure thing, Larry - Hey... now I didn't say that was okay. - You think we're good to put the cap back on now? - Yeah, I think we're good now. Hey, now we can't forget about that... that tab. It's got to click in, remember? - Right. - There we go It should be in ship shape. - Thanks for the help... and... and the coolant - Yeah, of course. Anything for an old friend - Mr. Rich... hmm Lawrence - Yeah? - Thank you for... for helping me figure all this out. - It's the least I could do [Piano music] [Clarinet and piano music till the end]
