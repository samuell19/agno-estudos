I SWEAR TO GOD WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM. [Lynn continues sobbing] [male narrator] APPROXIMATELY 7 WEEKS AFTER THE KILLING OF MARTENSEN AND GIBBS, 3 BLACK MEN WERE ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY AND MURDER. IN THE 2 AND ONE-HALF YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, 2 BACK-TO-BACK TRIALS EACH RESULTED IN HUNG JURIES. THE FOCUS OF THE 3RD TRIAL CENTERED AROUND ONE OF THESE 3 MEN: RAYMOND ELLSWORTH. MR. DISTRICT ATTORNEY, IS IT TRUE YOU'VE DECIDED TO PRESS FOR A 3RD TRIAL IN THE AMBUSH MURDER CASE?YES. WELL, HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT, WHEN THE FIRST 2 TRIALS RESULTING IN HUNG JURIES HAVE COST THE COUNTY AND STATE WELL OVER A MILLION DOLLARS? MONEY WAS NOT A FACTOR IN MY DECISION.WHAT IS? WELL, HOW DO YOU ANSWER CHARGES THAT YOUR OFFICE IS KEEPING THIS CASE ALIVE JUST TO APPEASE THE CITY? IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION, THE VOTE SHIFT OF THE JURY IN THE 2ND TRIAL FROM PRO-ACQUITTAL TO PRO-CONVICTION CONVINCED ME TO PUSH AHEAD. AS TO CHARGES MY OFFICE BUILT THIS CASE TO APPEASE THE CITY, HOGWASH. WE OWE IT TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE 2 SLAIN POLICEMEN TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED. I WANT A VERDICT. COULD YOU ELABORATE, PLEASE?I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS. ISN'T SOME LINE GOING TO BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE IN TERMS... [lock clanking open] [door closing] HOW'S MY MAN DOIN' TODAY? I'M GETTIN' A MESSAGE FROM YOU. OH, MASON AND SHELBY TOLD ME TO BE SURE TO GIVE THEIR DADDY BIG KISSES FOR THEM. YEAH, I MISS MY BABIES. SO, WHAT WENT DOWN? GO ON. TELL IT TO ME STRAIGHT, BABY. MOTION FOR DISMISSAL WAS DENIED. WELL, IS THE MAN GOING TO BE MY ATTORNEY, OR WHAT? HE COULD ONLY TAKE OUR CASE ON A LIMITED BASIS. I TOLD HIM THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE. WHAT ABOUT LEONARD WEINGLASS? HIS CALENDAR'S FULL. HE'D LIKE TO HELP, BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME. DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME! AND WHAT ABOUT MY TIME? OVER 2 YEARS LOCKED UP IN THIS RACIST JAIL. THE DEFENSE COMMITTEE-- THE DEFENSE COMMITTEE WAS ORGANIZED ON BEHALF OF RAY ELLSWORTH AND ANGELA DAVIS, BUT THIS NIGGER'S NOT-- NOT GLAMOROUS ENOUGH FOR THE LIBERALS WHO'D RATHER RALLY AROUND THE MORE POPULAR CAUSE OF FREEING THE CHIC RADICAL CELEBRITY, ANGELA DAVIS. THE A.C.L.U. IS THROWIN' A DINNER TO HELP US RAISE MONEY-- BABY, YOU REALIZE HOW MANY FRIED CHICKEN DINNERS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SELL FOR US TO BUY US A GOOD LAWYER? THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD LAWYERS THAT'LL WORK FOR LESS THAN THE STANDARD FEE. SEEMS LIKE THE POLITICAL RELEVANCE OF MY CASE HAS LOST ITS APPEAL. ROUND 15'S ABOUT TO BEGIN. ONLY MY WELL-WISHERS HAVE ALL DESERTED ME. IT'S BEEN ALMOST 3 YEARS, RAY. PEOPLE GET TIRED. THEY GET BORED. I'M STILL HERE. I'M NOT GIVIN' UP THE FIGHT. [door opening] [guard] TIME'S UP, ELLSWORTH. [D.A.] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMBUSH MURDERS CASE. FINALLY. I KNEW YOU HAD SOME REASON FOR INVITING ME OUT HERE TODAY. WELL, THIS THING'S BEEN DRAGGING ON FOR 3 YEARS NOW. WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT. OUR PROSECUTING ATTORNEY'S IN THE HOSPITAL AND CAN'T CONTINUE. HE'S MADE A FEW MISTAKES. WE'RE GOING TO DROP THE CHARGES AGAINST OTIS SANDERS. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. THAT LEAVES ELLSWORTH AND WARDELL AS THE PRIME SUSPECTS. I WANT YOU TO TAKE ELLSWORTH APART. HE'S THE MASTERMIND, AND HE HAS THE MOST PUBLICITY OF THE 3. THE EXISTING EVIDENCE ISN'T REALLY SUFFICIENT TO GIVE US THE LEVERAGE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET A SOLID CONVICTION. WE HAVE 3 SNITCHES IN JAIL RIGHT NOW ALL READY TO GO UP AGAINST HIM AGAIN. EBERHARDT WE'VE NEVER USED BECAUSE WE NEVER COULD CUT A DEAL WITH HIM. I'M GIVING YOU FREE REIN. JUST GET ME A CONVICTION. THE PEOPLE OF LINDERO ARE DEMANDING IT. YOU MEAN YOUR RE-ELECTION IS DEMANDING IT. IT WOULDN'T HURT YOUR CAREER, EITHER. [chuckles] "IT'S GETTING SO THAT THESE PEOPLE "ARE CREATING THEIR OWN VIETNAM RIGHT HERE IN THE STATES. "I SAY NO MORE TEAR GAS, "NO MORE HUMANE TREATMENT. THIS IS MADNESS. YOU SHOOT MAD DOGS." THIS WAS A LETTER PUBLISHED IN OUR LOCAL PAPER. "THESE PEOPLE" IT REFERS TO IS YOU. LET ME HAVE SOME FAITH IN YOU TONIGHT. LET RAY HAVE SOME FAITH IN YOU. HE'S PUT IT ON THE LINE FOR EVERY ONE OF YOU. IT'S TIME YOU PUT IT ON THE LINE FOR HIM. DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. IF YOU'RE GONNA PICKET, PICKET. IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO COURT, GO. JUST DON'T HASSLE. THANK YOU. [all applauding] THANK YOU.

MARSHALL'S AGREED TO INTERVIEW YOU. YEAH? WELL, I WANT TO INTERVIEW HIM. I WAS HOPING FOR A FLAMBOYANT MOVEMENT ATTORNEY. WHAT DO I GET? PLAIN WHITE BREAD. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE THAT BEFORE THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7, MR. WILLIAM KUNSTLER WAS, UH, ABOUT THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ATTORNEY YOU COULD FIND, SO DON'T JUDGE THE, UH, BREAD BY ITS WRAPPER. OVER 2 YEARS OF NO-WIN DEFENSE STRATEGY. YOU CAN BLAME YOURSELF FOR THAT. YOU SAYIN' I WANTED TO LOSE? YEAH. WELL, TO PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT AND STILL LOSE WOULD REINFORCE THE CONTENTION THAT, UH, THE SYSTEM IS STACKED AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE YOU. I THINK YOU FELT THAT AFTER THE 2ND MISTRIAL, THEY WERE PROBABLY GONNA LET YOU WALK AWAY. AND YOU SAY YOU CAN, UH, GIVE ME BETTER REPRESENTATION THAN I'VE HAD. I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T THINK SO. YOU CAN GET ME OFF? OH, WELL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GUARANTEES-- I'M NOT TALKING GUARANTEES, MAN. I'M TALKING COMMITMENT. I'LL GIVE YOU 300%. YOU HAVEN'T ASKED ME IF I DID IT, OFFED THOSE 2 PIGS. YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S MY FEELING THAT, UH, THE STATE IS PERSECUTING AN OUTSPOKEN BLACK LEADER ON THE FLIMSIEST OF EVIDENCE. NOW, I BELIEVE IN THE SYSTEM, AND I HAVE THE NAIVE ASSUMPTION THAT IF I DO MY JOB PROPERLY, THE 12 MEMBERS OF THE JURY WILL MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED. I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY, WHITE BOY. LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS AND I DON'T PRETEND FOR A MINUTE THAT I CAN GET INSIDE YOUR SKIN AND SEE LIFE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON. LIKE WHAT? WELL, UH... WE'RE BOTH EX-MARINES. RAY, JUSTICE IS FOR ALL, AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME PROVE THAT THE SYSTEM STILL WORKS. IF MY WIFE SAYS YOU'RE THE ATTORNEY... WHAT DOES RAY SAY? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT TO BE FREE. [Paul] WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE, BUT YOU'RE OUR LAST STOP. EVEN KNOWING HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME, ABOUT ALL WHITES RIGHT NOW? NOW, LOOK, HE'S TIRED AND ANGRY. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. HE'LL GET OVER IT. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO SOME OF HIS FRIENDS. MY HUSBAND WAS NEVER ONE TO CULTIVATE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. HE SEEMS TO CONFIDE IN YOU A GREAT DEAL. HE DEPENDS ON ME. IF I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP HIM, UH, THE 2 OF YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME. HI.HI. HOW'S IT GOING? WELL, HE'S SELF-RIGHTEOUS, ANGRY, HOSTILE, AND ARROGANT, BUT HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY. I LIKE HIS WIFE, THOUGH. SHE'S A... SHE'S A REAL FIGHTER. SHE'S HIS GREATEST ASSET. OH. IT'S FUNNY HOW A GOOD WOMAN CAN BRING OUT THE BEST IN A MAN, ISN'T IT? MMM. SO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE CASE? YEAH. W-WHY, DO YOU THINK IT'S A MISTAKE? NO. NO, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S VERY SMART POLITICALLY. WELL, I MEAN, YOU JUST FINISHED DEFENDING A--A SOCIAL OUTCAST WHO'D BEEN POLITICALLY PERSECUTED, RIGHT? I THINK THIS ONE IS GONNA BE A LOT TOUGHER. POLITICALLY SPEAKING. POLITICALLY SPEAKING.YOU WANT DINNER? YOU WANNA CHANGE THE SUBJECT? WELL, NO, I WANT TO EAT. WELL, ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'RE COOKING. HOW'S YOUR TRIAL GOING? FINE. YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS WICKED FANTASY TODAY ABOUT CHANGING SOMEONE'S TESTIMONY, JUST TO SEE IF ANYBODY'D NOTICE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVEN READS THESE TRANSCRIPTS I DO, ANYWAY. YEAH, WELL, I GOT TO START SOME READING TONIGHT AFTER DINNER. I GOT 2 TRIALS, 25 TRANSCRIPTS, 80 HOURS OF TAPE-RECORDED INTERVIEWS... HOW 'BOUT WE ORDER IN? YOUR HONOR, RAY ELLSWORTH HAS BEEN A LIFETIME RESIDENT OF THIS CITY AND COUNTY. ON TRIAL FOR MURDER. MR. BARNES, I THINK I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE CHARGES. YOUR HONOR, DURING THE LAST TRIAL, THE JURY VOTED 8 TO 4 TO CONVICT. WHICH, OF COURSE, IS THE ONLY REASON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS MOVED FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED 3RD TRIAL. NOW, MR. ELLSWORTH IS SURELY AWARE OF THE LAST JURY'S CONVICTION VOTE, WHICH MAKES IT SEEM LOGICAL TO ME TO PRESUME THAT HIS ONLY INTENTION CAN BE TO GET OUT ON BAIL IN ORDER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND DISAPPEAR. MY CLIENT HAS NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY CRIME, YET HE'S BEEN INCARCERATED FOR THE PAST 2 AND A HALF YEARS. I THINK THAT'S NOT ONLY UNFAIR, BUT IMMORAL. THIS MAN WANTS SOME SEMBLANCE OF A LIFE RETURNED TO HIM. JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THE NO-BAIL STATUS BE REVOKED. MOTION TO REVOKE NO-BAIL STATUS GRANTED. BAIL SET AT $25,000.THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. ANY FURTHER MOTIONS WILL BE TABLED UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON AT 2:00. COURT IS ADJOURNED. CABOT SHOULD HAVE GRANTED BAIL BEFORE THE 2ND TRIAL ANYWAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?ANYTHING. ANYTHING THAT WILL HELP ME KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RAY ELLSWORTH. THE LAST TIME I SAW ELLSWORTH, HE CALLED ME AN UNCLE TOM, MODIFIED BY A FEW 4-LETTER EXPLETIVES. AT BEST, WE GRUDGINGLY RESPECT EACH OTHER. WAS HE, UH, CONSIDERED A, A LEADER IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY? YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, BLACKS IN LINDERO ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE. THEY DON'T ROCK THE BOAT. RAY WAS SINCERE. WHEN THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THE COMMUNITY, HE'D RESPOND. HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO SOME VERY GOOD ISSUES AND HE HAD GUTS IN DOING IT. PEOPLE WERE SCARED. THEY WEREN'T READY FOR HIM. WHAT WERE THEY AFRAID OF? GOING DOWN AND CONFRONTING THE MAN IS RIDICULOUS IN THIS TOWN. THERE'S TOO MUCH FEAR. YOU'D LOSE YOUR JOB. SO THEY JUST DENOUNCED RAY AS A RADICAL, A MILITANT? HE PLAYED THE ROLE, HE WORE THE SHADES, THE GLOVES. [car horn honking] THE DANCE WOULD'VE TURNED INTO A RACE RIOT IF RAY HADN'T SHOWED UP. IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW HE COULD DIFFUSE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. THE KIDS LOOKED UP TO HIM? HE MADE 'EM PROUD OF THEIR BLACKNESS. THEY NEEDED THAT. HE ALSO COUNSELED THEM AGAINST DRUGS. BUT IT WASN'T JUST THE BLACKS THAT RESPECTED HIM. SOME OF THE WHITE KIDS AT THAT DANCE THAT NIGHT DEDICATED A BOOK OF POEMS TO HIM. [school bell ringing] WELL, THANK YOU. [Paul] FEELS GOOD TO SWEAT? [Ray] YEAH. I HEARD YOU BEEN ASKING AROUND ABOUT ME. YEAH, WELL, I HAD TO START SOMEWHERE. RAY, [dog barking] IF WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS THING, YOU GOT TO START TALKING TO ME. WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO START? WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF THE SERVICE? WHEN I GOT OUT FROM THE CORPS, I WANTED TO BE A COP. UNTIL ONE DAY THE MAN PULLED ME OVER FOR NO REASON, THREW A SHOTGUN AT MY HEAD AND TOLD ME TO "SPREAD-EAGLE, NIGGER." AND THEN WHEN I GOT MARRIED, I DECIDED ALL I WANTED WAS A PIECE OF THE AMERICAN PIE, SO I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS. IDEAL HOUSECLEANING SERVICE. WELL, I HAD A LARGE CLIENTELE OF WHITE FOLKS. EVERYBODY LOVES A GOOD, DOCILE NEGRO. YOU'RE A SPOKESMAN FOR THE LINDERO BLACK COMMUNITY. YOU BEEN TALKING TO THE WRONG BUNCH OF NIGGERS. THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO SAID YOU BANDED TOGETHER BLACKS WHO FELT HELPLESS. THE SO-CALLED "BLACK LEADERS" DIDN'T WANT ME INVOLVED IN THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY KNEW I WOULDN'T KISS UP. [birds chirping] SO YOU CHOSE THE ROLE OF A BLACK MILITANT. I DIDN'T CHOOSE ANYTHING. [children chattering]THE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING MADE ME SEE THINGS MORE CLEARLY. LOCALLY, THEY WERE HAVING VARIOUS OBSERVANCES FOR DR. KING. I FELT THE BLACK COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT. SOMETHING FOR BLACK CHILDREN TO REMEMBER HIM BY. SO I PROPOSED A MONUMENT. THE CITY OFFICIALS TURNED ME DOWN. DID THEY GIVE YOU A REASON? THEY'VE GOT THE POWER, MAN. WHEN THE WHITE MAJORITY ASKS FOR A MONUMENT TO 2 DEAD COPS, 4 ARE DEDICATED. BUT WHEN THE BLACK COMMUNITY ASKS FOR ONE MEMORIAL, TO FIT THE STATURE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN THIS COUNTRY'S EVER PRODUCED, THE WHITE MAJORITY SAYS, "HEY, YOU PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUT OF LINE." SANDERS' ATTORNEY CONVINCED HIM TO ACCEPT THE D.A.'S DEAL. THE BROTHER WAS WEAK. KEPT ASKING ME TO PRAY WITH HIM. SOMETHING ABOUT HOW ALL THAT MATTERED WAS THAT GOD KNEW THE TRUTH. HE'LL BE SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE LORD SOON. I WAS TOLD HE WAS ON HIS WAY UP TO A SEMINARY. I'VE SPOKEN WITH WARDELL'S ATTORNEY AND WE AGREED THAT A SEPARATE DEFENSE IS OUR BEST STRATEGY. OK, RAY, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS. APRIL 12, 1971. JUST RUN IT BY LIKE I'D NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE. FROM WHERE? YOU WERE AT HOME. WHAT WERE YOU DOIN'? I WAS GETTIN' DRESSED. I WAS GONNA TAKE MY WIFE AND KIDS FOR A DRIVE WHEN THEY GOT BACK FROM THE MARKET. THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. THIS KID NAMED THOMAS SAID THERE'D BEEN A COUPLE OF SHOTS FIRED NEAR LINDERO PARK. THOMAS, WAS THAT HIS FIRST NAME OR HIS LAST NAME? I DON'T KNOW, MAN. FIRST, LAST. LAST, I THINK. HE WAS JUST SOME KID I'D SEEN AROUND A COUPLE TIMES. WHY DID HE COME TO YOU? PEOPLE CAME TO ME WHEN SOMETHING WENT DOWN IN THE COMMUNITY. OK, SO HE SAID HE HEARD SOME SHOTS. I FINISHED PUTTING ON MY CLOTHES. MY TRUCK WASN'T RUNNING, SO I RAN TO THE PARK. I WENT ON FOOT. IT WAS LESS THAN A HALF A MILE. IT WAS DARK. I FELL A COUPLE TIMES. WHEN I GOT THERE, I SAW A COP TURNING PEOPLE AWAY. SO I DOUBLED BACK. [people chattering] [police radio chattering] [siren blaring] [man] COME ALONG! [policeman] GET OVER HERE! WALK TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR. [police radio chattering] WHAT'S--WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED? PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE HOOD. SPREAD YOUR LEGS. WHAT'S--WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, O-OFFICER? STAY WHERE YOU ARE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? RAY ELLSWORTH. PUT YOUR RIGHT HAND BEHIND YOUR BACK, MR. ELLSWORTH. WHAT'S GOIN' ON? PUT YOUR LEFT HAND BEHIND YOUR BACK. COUPLE OF OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SHOT. I'M GONNA HAVE TO HOLD YOU FOR A WHILE. ARE THEY DEAD?I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ANYWAY? HOW COME YOU'RE SO OUT OF BREATH? I WAS TOLD THERE WAS SOME--SOME TROUBLE OVER AT THE PARK, SO I RAN UP HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENIN'. I WAS ON MY WAY HOME WHEN YOU STOPPED ME.UH-HUH. HOW'D YOU GET THAT DIRT ON YOUR TROUSERS? I FELL WHEN I WAS CUTTIN' ACROSS A LAWN OVER ON, UH, GRACE. YOU COME WITH ME. LET'S GO. [female dispatcher] 2ND SUBJECT, WHITE MALE, 17, WEARING PLAID WOOL SHIRT AND BROWN CORDUROY JACKET. 3RD SUBJECT, WHITE, WEARING A HUNTING CAP. 4TH SUBJECT, MALE NEGRO WITH LARGE AFRO, WEARING GLASSES. OK, MR. ELLSWORTH, YOU'RE FREE TO GO. SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. LOOK, UH, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE SOUTH SIDE. MAYBE IF I HUNG AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE, I MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP.SURE. [Ray] THE FOLLOWING DAY, 2 DETECTIVES CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD ME THEY WANTED TO TAKE ME DOWNTOWN TO ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS. THEY HAD ME GO OVER IN DETAIL HOW I CAME TO BEING STOPPED BY BOWIE AT THE PARK. WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER BOWIE LEFT YOU? I CALLED MY WIFE, HAD HER COME GET ME. WE KNOW IT WAS THE BLACKS FROM THE SOUTH SIDE THAT DID THOSE KILLINGS. SOONER OR LATER, YOU'RE GONNA COME TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHO THEY ARE, RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH, I MIGHT COME TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE. WOULD YOU TELL US?NO. I DIDN'T GAIN THE PEOPLE'S TRUST BY INFORMIN' ON 'EM. THEY FOUND ONE OF THE MURDER WEAPONS AT THE EDGE OF THE PARK. IT WAS ONE OF 2 C.H.P. SHOTGUNS THAT WAS STOLEN OUT OF A HIGHWAY PATROL CAR AT THE '68 LINDERO PARK RIOTS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE GUNS? LAST I HEARD, ONE OF 'EM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IN CRESTRIDGE. WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT? I CAN'T RUN THAT DOWN TO YOU. AFTER THEY WERE RIPPED OFF, SOMEBODY APPROACHED ME ABOUT BUYIN' 'EM. I TOLD THEM THEY WERE TOO HOT AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM. WHO APPROACHED YOU ABOUT BUYIN' THE GUNS? I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT EITHER, MAN. OK, MR. ELLSWORTH, I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT ALL THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOR YOU TODAY. HEY, LOOK, IF YOU GUYS THINK I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, WHY DON'T YOU PUT ME ON THE LIE BOX? WE COULD ARRANGE FOR IT IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST RIGHT NOW? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I WOULD. COME ON, LET'S GO. LET'S GET IT OVER WITH. [Ray] I NEVER CALLED TO FIND OUT THE RESULTS, AND THEY DIDN'T NOTIFY ME. A MONTH LATER, POLICE SURROUNDED MY HOUSE. JIMMY, THE OTHER SIDE. [car doors closing] [dog barking] MR. RAY ELLSWORTH? DETECTIVE LANDIS FROM THE LINDERO POLICE DEPARTMENT. I DEMAND ENTRANCE. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? GOOD MORNIN', RAY. I HAVE A WARRANT HERE FOR YOUR ARREST. FOR WHAT?2 COUNTS OF HOMICIDE. HOMICIDE? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'. NO, SIR. WE DO NOT KID. WOW. WELL, CAN I GET MYSELF DRESSED? CERTAINLY. WE'LL HELP. UH, MY SHIRT IS IN THE SAME DRAWER WITH ONE OF MY GUNS. GET AWAY FROM THAT DRESSER!ALL RIGHT. STAND RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE, YOU UNDERSTAND? TAKE IT EASY.WE'LL GET YOUR SHIRT FOR YOU. JUST RELAX. IT'S A HELL OF A THING TO HAVE SOMEBODY STANDIN' AT YOUR DAMN BACK WITH A GUN. LOOK, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GUNS, I'LL BE GLAD TO SHOW YOU EVERY GUN IN THE HOUSE. WHAT'S THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT? I'M UNDER ARREST. DID YOU ASK TO SEE THE WARRANT?NO. WELL, DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT?YES, MA'AM. [dog barking] THE RIGHT BRAKE LIGHT ISN'T WORKING. OH, A BRAKE LIGHT'S OUT? OK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. UH, IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BULB, IS ALL-- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, BABY? YEAH, YEAH, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES WITH YOU?YEAH, I GOT SOME. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. EXPLAIN IT TO THE KIDS FOR ME. I'LL GET US AN ATTORNEY. ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING. [car engine starting] [police radio chattering] WHAT DID THE POLICE SEIZE AS EVIDENCE? THEY TOOK MY LEVI PANTS, JACKET, A PAIR OF BROWN LEATHER SHOES, A PAIR OF WHITE TENNIS SHOES, SOME GLOVES, A .38, AND 2 12-GAUGE SHOTGUNS. AT THE TIME OF YOUR ARREST, DID THE POLICE MENTION HAWKINS OR STEELE IN CONNECTION WITH THE C.H.P. SHOTGUN? HAWKINS, HE'S IN CHINO PRISON ON A PERJURY CHARGE, ISN'T HE? THAT'S THE MAN. MR. HAWKINS, I'D LIKE YOU TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT YOU'RE NOT BEING BRIBED OR COERCED INTO TALKING TO ME AND THAT YOU'RE AWARE THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS BEING RECORDED. I'M HAPPY TO TALK, AND I'M AWARE I'M BEIN' RECORDED. HOW DID YOU COME TO GIVING THE POLICE INFORMATION ABOUT RAY ELLSWORTH AND THE STOLEN C.H.P. SHOTGUN? I WAS ON 2 YEARS PROBATION FOR CHIPPIN' A LITTLE SMACK. THE COPS WERE TRYIN' TO GET A LINE ON THE SHOTGUN AND I'D BEEN TOLD TO KEEP MY EYES AND EARS OPEN. HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR US, LYLE? NOTHIN' AT THE MOMENT. IT'S HOT OUT THERE. NOBODY'S OUT ON THE STREETS ANYMORE AT NIGHT. WE PUT ELLSWORTH ON THE POLYGRAPH, YOU KNOW. PARDON? ELLSWORTH, WE PUT HIM ON THE POLYGRAPH. YEAH, I'M LISTENIN'. WELL, WE THINK HE MIGHT BE IN ON THIS. IF YOU COULD GIVE US A NAME OR A WAY TO GO... IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE. WE'RE OFFERING A REWARD, LYLE. $15,000 FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO ARREST AND CONVICTION. $15,000? THAT'S RIGHT. WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOU COULD TAKE AND BLOW THIS PLACE. YOU FOLLOW WHAT I MEAN? YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT. 15 BIG ONES. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU SURE I CAN'T GET YOU ANYTHING, LYLE? NO, I'M TIRED. I GOT A BAD HEADACHE. I JUST WANNA GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH, SO DO I, LYLE. SO DO I. D.A. SAID TO BOOK HIM. THAT'S 3 FELONIES. BEING AN ACCESSORY--I AIN'T ACCESSORY TO NOTHIN'! I TOLD YOU MY BROTHER--THEY CAN MAKE YOU AT THE SCENE OF THE '68 RIOTS. BEING AN ACCESSORY TO BURGLARY, ARSON, AND GRAND THEFT WILL GUARANTEE YOU AT LEAST 5 YEARS. NOW, WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO STOLE THOSE SHOTGUNS. YOU CAN HELP US FILL IN THE GAPS OR YOU CAN SIT THERE AND PRETEND LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'. IT'S UP TO YOU. YOU TALK TO HIM. I'M GOING TO GET SOME CHOW. SEE, MY PARTNER FEELS YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING US A LOT OF CRAP. AND IF YOU DON'T COME CLEAN WITH ME, HE'S NOT GONNA BE OPPOSED TO BOOKIN' YOU. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE GUNS. NOW THAT HE'S NOT HERE, I'M GONNA LET YOU IN ON SOMETHING. WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE WITH GERALD STEELE WHEN THOSE GUNS WERE STOLEN. GERALD STEELE? EVERYBODY IN THE DAMN SOUTH SIDE KNOWS HE GOT ONE OF THOSE C.H.P. SHOTGUNS. THE ONLY SHOT-- LOOK, I KNOW WALLY HAD ONE. AND I HEARD THAT GERALD STEELE HAD ONE. I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH HIM. YEAH. YEAH, I REMEMBER HE HAD ONE 'CAUSE I GAVE HIM A RIDE OVER TO RAY ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE WHERE HE SOLD IT. YOU'RE SAYING HE SOLD IT TO RAY ELLSWORTH? NO, I AIN'T SAY THAT. I SAID I GAVE HIM A RIDE THERE. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SAY THAT IN FRONT OF ELLSWORTH? [sighing] MAN, I GOT TO LIVE IN LINDERO. NOW, WHY YOU'RE-- WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER FOR RAY ELLSWORTH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD YOU'RE THINKIN' "THIS GUY'S TOO BIG. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BOOK HIM." LOOK, I TOLD YOU WHAT WENT DOWN. [Landis] HEY, LYLE, I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THE CONVERSATION YOU WERE HAVING WITH LAMBERT. THINKING ABOUT GOING OVER TO ELLSWORTH'S? [Hawkins] THEY, UM, HELD ME FOR 2 DAYS UNTIL I TOLD THEM WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR. IF ELLSWORTH'S INVOLVED LIKE YOU SAY HE IS, LYLE, HE SURE AS HELL AIN'T GONNA THINK TWICE ABOUT KILLIN' YOU. YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL. YOU ASK ME, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED MY HELP. YOU HEAR? YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP. JUST REMEMBER THOSE WORDS. GO ON, TAKE IT. I DON'T WANT IT. IT MIGHT GET OUT ON THE STREET THAT I'M A SNITCH. I'M GIVING IT TO YOU BECAUSE YOU NEED IT. YOU BELIEVE I'M A SNITCH? I THINK YOU'RE A MAN IN TROUBLE. LYLE. I'LL BE TALKIN' TO YOU. WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE TIME TO MAKE YOU LIE TO THE POLICE ABOUT RAY ELLSWORTH? POLICE WAS ON MY BACK. THEY WANTED ELLSWORTH SO BAD THAT IF I'D JUST SAID STEELE AND I SOLD HIM A GUN, THEY'D CUT ME LOOSE. DO YOU THINK STEELE TOLD THE TRUTH ON THE, UH, ON THE WITNESS STAND? I DON'T "THINK," I KNOW HE WASN'T TELLING THE TRUTH. [guard] TIME'S UP, MR. MARSHALL. IF I'M CALLED TO TESTIFY AGAIN, I'LL TAKE THE 5TH. YOU'RE A CONVICTED PERJURER. THEY CAN'T GET YOU NOW FOR TELLING THE TRUTH. I'M JUST TIRED OF BEING HASSLED. WHAT ABOUT RAY ELLSWORTH? DON'T YOU THINK HE'S TIRED OF BEING HASSLED? HE'S GOT YOU ON HIS SIDE. I AIN'T GOT NOBODY. [Lyle] I DON'T "THINK," I KNOW HE WASN'T TELLIN' THE TRUTH. HE'S THE ONE WHO'S LYIN', MAN! I WAS WITH HIM. I SEEN IT GO DOWN. WHAT DID THE POLICE ASK YOU THE NIGHT THEY PICKED YOU UP? THEY ASKED ME ABOUT THAT SHOTGUN THEY TOOK FROM LINDERO PARK. GERALD, YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHO TO FINGER IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SPOON-FED BY THE POLICE. OH, HELL, MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'. I KNOW THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE THE STAND THIS NEXT TIME, YOU BETTER HAVE YOUR STORY STRAIGHT. YEAH, WELL, YOU AND I ARE THROUGH TALKING, YOU GOT IT? [sirens wailing] COUNSEL, GET TO THE POINT. THERE'S A PROBLEM REGARDING THE GUN SEIZED AT THE ELLSWORTH HOUSE DURING THE ARREST IN 1971. YOUR HONOR, THAT GUN IS SIMILAR IN TYPE TO THE C.H.P. GUN FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE AMBUSH, HEREIN ESTABLISHING FAMILIARITY ON ELLSWORTH'S PART WITH THAT KIND OF WEAPON. CIRCUMSTANTIALLY, WE INFER THAT ELLSWORTH WAS THE ONE USED THAT GUN IN THE 1968 INCIDENT AND IT WAS ALSO ELLSWORTH WHO FIRED THAT WEAPON FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE 1971 SHOOTING. [Paul] THE PROSECUTOR'S COME TO HIS CONCLUSIONS THROUGH SPECULATION. HE HASN'T SHOWN ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT MY CLIENT WAS AT THE SCENE OF EITHER SHOOTING. THEREFORE, I REQUEST THAT THE GUN NOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE. YOUR HONOR, I CONTEND THE--THE RELEVANCE IS THERE. JUDGE CABOT, IF--IF THE GUN IS APPROVED AS EVIDENCE AND MY CLIENT IS CONVICTED, YOU'RE INVITING A REVERSAL ON APPEAL. [clock ticking] MR. BARNES, I FEEL THE STATE'S MOTION HAS NO PROBATIVE VALUE. THEREFORE, I MUST DENY IT. NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. [Paul] JUDGE CABOT WON'T BE TRYING OUR CASE A 2ND TIME. I'VE REQUESTED WETHERLY. THAT GOOD?HE'S A LIBERAL. [chuckling] THAT'S GOOD. HEY, I'M GOING TO SEE, UH, MOLLY SLAVEN. ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO ASK HER? DON'T EVEN KNOW HER. JUST SOME CRACKER WHO HUNG OUT WITH THE WRONG NIGGERS. I'VE RUN AWAY LOTS OF TIMES. THIS IS A NICE PLACE, ISN'T IT? OH, YEAH, IT'S A VERY NICE PLACE. SO, YOU WERE, UH, IN THAT TINY LITTLE CELL AT LINDERO JUVENILE HALL. YEAH. THE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON ME. I TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY DRINKING AJAX. THEY PUMPED MY STOMACH. THERE WAS TALK THAT THE POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE COPS THAT WERE KILLED. SO I TOLD THE MATRON I KNEW ABOUT IT. UH, FIGURING IF, UH, IF YOU HELPED THEM OUT, THEN THEY'D LET YOU OUT OF THAT HORRIBLE CELL. YEAH. NEXT DAY, 2 POLICEMEN CAME TO SEE ME. I WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU MADE THAT CALL FROM, THE ONE ABOUT THE FIGHT IN THE ALLEY. AND WHO ASKED YOU? AND DON'T FENCE WITH ME, BECAUSE IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS. I DIDN'T MAKE THE CALL! IF YOU TELL US THE TRUTH, YOUNG LADY, WE'RE GONNA LOOK OUT FOR YOU. THAT'S A PROMISE. IT WASN'T ME WHO MADE THAT CALL. CAN'T BE TELLING ON MY FRIENDS. YOU GET IN TROUBLE. BUT YOU WON'T GET IN TROUBLE. YOU'VE GOT OUR WORD ON THAT. WELL, GUESS I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF IT. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. YOU MADE THAT CALL. YEAH. WHERE DID YOU MAKE IT FROM? WHAT TIME? UM, IT WAS AFTER DARK. [sighing] WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THE POLICE WHEN YOU CALLED THEM? I, UH, I TOLD THEM, UM... AW, COME ON! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? OK, LET'S GO BACK. WHO TOLD YOU TO MAKE THE CALL? MY BOYFRIEND, ELTON WARDELL. HE WASN'T THE ONE WHO DID IT, THOUGH, BUT HE WAS THERE. HE WAS LAUGHIN' AND EVERYTHING, AND SHOWIN' ME THESE SHOTGUN SHELLS. DID YOU SEE THE SHOTGUN? YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS? DOUBLE BARREL. HE KEEPS IT UNDER HIS BED. [sighing] WHERE DOES YOUR BOYFRIEND LIVE, MOLLY? IF I TELL YOU, ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME GET OUT OF HERE LIKE YOU PROMISED? SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. WHAT'S ELTON WARDELL'S ADDRESS? [Molly] I TOLD THEM WHAT THEY WANTED. A MONTH AFTER I GOT OUT OF JUVENILE HALL, THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD ME I WAS UNDER ARREST. THE VOICE PRINT WE TOOK OF YOU PROVES YOU MADE THE FIRST CALL THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS. THAT'S JUST LIKE FINGERPRINTS! SO YOU CAN'T DENY IT! I SWEAR TO YOU! I DIDN'T MAKE THE CALL! DON'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME, LET'S BOOK HER! LOOK, IT'S A MISTAKE! YOU'RE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE GAS CHAMBER, AND THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! IT'S NO MISTAKE. YOU MADE THAT CALL, AND YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL. EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP, YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE FACES OF THOSE 2 POLICEMEN ALL SHOT UP TO NOTHING! AMBUSHED!AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. WHO WAS IN THE BUSHES WITH ELTON? [sobbing] THERE WAS ELTON AND 2 GUYS AND RAY ELLSWORTH! YOU KNOW THAT FOR CERTAIN?I WAS THERE! I SAW ELLSWORTH PULL THE TRIGGER ON THAT SHOTGUN. HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU HEAR? 3. THEY WENT, "POW, POW, POW!" THEN I SAW THE BLOOD POURIN' OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE CAR! [sighs] YOU SAW THE BLOOD? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE BLOOD? DAMN IT, I DON'T REMEMBER! THEY WERE STANDING THERE, AND I SAW THIS THING GOING DOWN, AND I WALKED DOWN THE STREET. ELTON, MAN, HE DIDN'T PULL NO TRIGGER. HE'S JUST A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE. HE'S GONNA KILL ME. NOBODY'S GONNA KILL YOU. WE'LL MAKE CERTAIN OF THAT. [Molly] AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING, I TOLD THE JUDGE THAT EVERYTHING I TOLD THE POLICE WAS A BUNCH OF BULL. WHY DID YOU LIE TO THE POLICE? BECAUSE LIES WHAT THE POLICE WANT TO HEAR! NOW, LOOK, I CAN YELL JUST AS LOUD AS YOU CAN! NOW, EITHER, YOU START BEHAVING LIKE A YOUNG LADY, OR YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSELF INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE.I ALREADY AM IN TROUBLE! MARSHAL, TAKE MISS SLAVEN OUT OF HERE! AND DON'T LET HER BACK IN THIS COURTROOM TILL SHE LEARNS HOW TO BEHAVE! JERK!OUT! JERK!OUT! [Molly] USE YOUR GAVEL, JERK! EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO TELL THE TRUTH, NOBODY WANTED TO HEAR IT. I THINK YOU'VE MATURED A GREAT DEAL IN THE PAST 2 YEARS. NOW YOU'RE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRUTH AND THE FANTASY. YEAH. I WAS JUST OFF ON A BIG EGO TRIP THEN. YOU KNOW, I WAS BIG AND BAD. MOLLY, WHY DID YOU LIE ABOUT RAY ELLSWORTH? IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL. I MEAN, THEY KEPT SHOWING ME THIS PICTURE OF RAY. THEY KEPT ASKING, "WASN'T HE THERE?" I SAID "YEAH." HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW ABOUT WHAT YOU DID? WELL, I KNOW THEY GOT ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE 'CAUSE OF ME. WOW. BET... BET RAY'D LIKE TO MEET ME SO HE COULD WRING MY NECK. OH, NO. I--I DON'T THINK RAY'S GOT THAT ON HIS MIND. NO. I, I THINK HE'S MORE CONCERNED WITH SAVING HIS OWN NECK RIGHT NOW. YEAH. WE FEEL THERE'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION AT THIS TIME. SO WE'RE DROPPING CHARGES AGAINST MR. WARDELL AND GOING AHEAD WITH RAY ELLSWORTH AS THE LONE DEFENDANT. [reporter] MR. BISHOP, HOW CAN THE STATE JUSTIFY TRYING ELLSWORTH? [Bishop] I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT BECAUSE OF MR. ELLSWORTH'S PENDING TRIAL. [switching off] I'M VERY HAPPY FOR WARDELL. HE SPENT 2 AND A HALF YEARS IN PRISON FOR SOMETHING HE HAD NO PART OF. YOU'RE IN THE DARK ALONE NOW. IT'S A FRAME-UP, MAN. THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY. I'M THEIR BEST SHOT. YOU'RE NOT THEIR BEST SHOT. YOU'RE JUST A BIGGER FISH. MR. WARDELL, AFTER SPENDING 2 YEARS BEHIND BARS, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE FREE? I'M GLAD TO BE FREE. [camera clicking]I'M SAD THAT RAY ELLSWORTH'S STILL ON THE LINE. 'CAUSE IN MY HEART I DON'T BELIEVE THE BROTHER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT, MR. GOLD? YES, FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THAT OTIS SANDERS, ELTON WARDELL, AND RAY ELLSWORTH WERE GUILTY. TODAY THEY ADMITTED THAT TWO-THIRDS OF EVERYTHING THEY'VE SAID IS UNTRUE. AND AS FAR AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS CONCERNED, HE HAS BEEN RE-ELECTED. HE DOES NOT NEED RAY ELLSWORTH FOR A SCAPEGOAT ANYMORE. THANK YOU.[reporter] HEY, LET ME-- THAT IS IT!ONE QUESTION, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME. I'VE GOT SOME THINGS TO DO. ALL THE TIME I WAS IN THE JOINT, I THOUGHT ABOUT KATIA. ABOUT HOW UNFAIR IT WAS TO HER. SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT JEROME FERGUSON? I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM. REFRESH MY MEMORY. HE'S A PUNK. THAT PUNK MAY BE THE ONE WHO PUTS YOU AWAY FOR LIFE. I WAS PUT IN A CELL WITH FERGUSON NEXT TO A TRANSSEXUAL NAMED VANESSA. AS WAS CUSTOMARY IN THE JOINT, FERGUSON INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO ME. I KNEW ABOUT HIS SNITCH LABEL. EVERYBODY KNEW. I'M J-- I'M JEROME. JERRY. [sighing] YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A BAD ENOUGH REPUTATION AS IT IS. SO IF YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THOSE... KILLING THOSE COPS, I--I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT. THEN HOW COME THOSE LITTLE RED EARS OF YOURS ARE BURNING? WILL YOU SHUT UP, VANESSA! [Ray] FOR THE MOST PART, WE KEPT OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY. AFTER A WHILE, FERGUSON STARTED GETTING MIGRAINE HEADACHES SO BAD HE HAD TO BE TAKEN FROM THE CELL. [door opening] DID YOU HAVE A NICE LITTLE CHAT WITH THE D.A.? HE ASKED TO SEE ME. WHAT LIES DID YOU TELL ON THE BROTHER, FERGUSON? GO TO HELL, SALTY! I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I SWEAR. THE D.A. WANTED ME TO RAT ON YOU. AND PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE? ALL HE OFFERED ME WAS A CUP OF COFFEE. YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T FINK ON A FRIEND. [chuckling] TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT THE D.A. SAID. HE--HE ASKED IF YOU SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE KILLINGS. SAID IF I GAVE TESTIMONY, HE COULDN'T PROMISE ANYTHING, BUT THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE APPRECIATIVE. NOW, LISTEN TO ME, FERGUSON. I AIN'T SAID NOTHING TO YOU ABOUT KILLING NO PIGS. I KNOW THAT, RAY. I KNOW THAT. DO YOU KNOW JOHN PEARSON? FOR SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T WANNA HEAR ANYTHING, YOU SURE ASK A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS. I AIN'T MADE NO STATEMENTS ABOUT JOHN PEARSON. SOMEBODY MUST'VE TOLD YOU TO ASK ME THAT. NO.SHUT UP! LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU AND THE D.A. GOT COOKED UP, JEROME. BUT DON'T ASK ME NO MORE QUESTIONS. I TOLD YOU BEFORE, I DIDN'T KILL THOSE PIGS. I DON'T KNOW WHO DID AND I DON'T GIVE A DAMN! [Ray] AND THAT WAS THE LAST HE SPOKE OF IT. [Barnes] MRS. TYSON, COULDN'T YOU BE, UH, MISTAKEN ABOUT THE NIGHT YOU SAW MR. ELLSWORTH RUNNING TO THE PARK? [Emily] I TOLD YOU BOYS BEFORE. MY GRANDCHILDREN WERE HERE APRIL 12TH BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER HAD JUST COME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL. I HEAR IT WAS ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE YOU CAME FORWARD TO TESTIFY. NOW, SURELY YOU COULD BE MISTAKEN ABOUT THE DATE. I AM NOT MISTAKEN. SOMETHING'S GOING ON OUTSIDE. BARNES AND THAT COP WHO ARRESTED YOU ARE OUTSIDE TALKING TO EMILY TYSON. EMILY, RAY ELLSWORTH STOOD UP AND DID THOSE SHOOTINGS AND PLANNED THE WHOLE THING HIMSELF. SO HELP ME GOD, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING IN MY WHOLE LIFE. WELL, MY IMPRESSION OF MR. ELLSWORTH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN YOURS. I FIGURE IF HE HAD THE KIND OF DISPOSITION YOU PEOPLE SAY HE HAS, HE WOULDN'T AMBUSH SOMEBODY. HE'D WALK RIGHT UP TO THEM AND SHOOT 'EM. PERIOD. MRS. TYSON, YOU'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO TALK TO THEM. BARNES, THIS WOMAN'S BEEN BADGERED ENOUGH. YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN UNDER MEDICAL CARE. NOW LEAVE HER ALONE. USING HIS ONE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE, THE STATE HAS REMOVED JUDGE WETHERLY FROM HEARING THE CASE. I'M SO TIRED OF ASSIGNING IT OUT ONLY TO HAVE IT BOUNCE BACK IN MY LAP, I'VE DECIDED TO HEAR IT MYSELF. IT WILL BE MY LAST CASE BEFORE RETIRING. IS COLLIER A LIBERAL?A MODERATE. IN FACT, WE'VE GOT ONE OF THE BEST JUDGES IN THE STATE. CONGRATULATIONS, COUNSELOR. GOT YOURSELF A DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR A JUDGE. WE COULD HAVE HAD WETHERLY. DON'T GET ME WRONG. IT WON'T AFFECT THE OUTCOME. [people chattering] [people cheering] ALL RISE. [bailiff] EXTINGUISH ALL CIGARETTES, PUT AWAY ALL READING MATTER. THIS COURT IS NOW IN SESSION. THE HONORABLE JUDGE LOWELL COLLIER PRESIDING. [gavel pounding] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS CASE DID NOT BEGIN ON APRIL 12TH OF 1971. IT BEGAN YEARS BEFORE, WHEN A DISGRUNTLED HOUSECLEANER NAMED RAYMOND ELLSWORTH BECAME THE SELF-APPOINTED LEADER OF THE SOUTH SIDE BLACK COMMUNITY. A LEADER OF VIOLENCE, ATTRACTING MILITANT, VIOLENT PEOPLE, USING HIS POSITION-- OBJECTION TO THE CHARACTERIZATION AS PREJUDICIAL. SUSTAINED. THE JURY IS INSTRUCTED TO DISREGARD THE PROSECUTOR'S STATEMENT. MR. BARNES, IN THE FUTURE, WILL YOU REFRAIN FROM MAKING ANY COMMENTS REGARDING THE CHARACTER OF THE DEFENDANT? YES, YOUR HONOR. THE AMBUSH MURDERS OF OFFICERS ADAM GIBBS AND BEN MARTENSEN WERE COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED, COWARDLY, AND DECEPTIVE. AND THE STATE WILL SHOW THAT RAYMOND ELLSWORTH PLANNED AND EXECUTED THESE MURDERS. THE CASE AGAINST MY CLIENT IS BASED ON NOTHING. NOTHING MORE THAN SUPPOSITION, HYPOTHESIS, CONJECTURE, AND LIES. YOU WILL HEAR OF THE ALLEGED SALE TO MR. ELLSWORTH OF THE TELLTALE HIGHWAY PATROL SHOTGUN BY STEELE AND HAWKINS, THE TESTIMONY OF MOLLY SLAVEN AND OFFICER HOYT, AND FINALLY, THE 2 JAILHOUSE CONFESSIONS OF VANESSA AND JEROME FERGUSON, WHICH WILL CREATE NOT ONLY A REASONABLE DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS, BUT LEAVE YOU IN A STATE OF TOTAL DISBELIEF. HAWKINS TOOK THE SHOTGUN OUT OF THE TRUNK. IT WAS WRAPPED IN A BLANKET. AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR. AND YOU REMAINED IN THE CAR. YEAH. I SEEN HIM GO INSIDE AND A FEW MINUTES LATER, HE CAME BACK TO THE CAR WITHOUT THE GUN. HE SAID HE SOLD IT TO ELLSWORTH. HOW MUCH DID MR. HAWKINS GET FOR THE SHOTGUN? $50. THANK YOU. YOUR WITNESS, COUNSELOR. MR. STEELE, SHORTLY BEFORE THE 2ND TRIAL, IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER, YOU WENT ON RECORD STATING THAT YOU NEVER WENT TO MR. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE. NEITHER YOU NOR HAWKINS EVER RECEIVED ANY MONEY FROM ELLSWORTH. YOU PASSED THE SHOTGUN ON TO HAWKINS AND THE LAST TIME YOU SAW IT, IT WAS IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR. AND WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE, YOU WENT ALONG WITH HAWKINS' STORY TO PROTECT HIM. AM I CORRECT? IT WAS A RUSE. I WANTED IT TO GET BACK TO THE PROSECUTOR SO HE WOULDN'T CALL ME TO TESTIFY. AT THE TIME THE POLICE PICKED YOU UP FOR QUESTIONING, HADN'T YOU JUST BEEN INCARCERATED AT TRACY FOR ASSAULTING A YOUNG LADY? OBJECTION. IRRELEVANT. OVERRULED. ANSWER, PLEASE. YES. YOU WERE ON 2 YEARS PROBATION AND WERE TOLD IF YOU DIDN'T COME CLEAN ABOUT THE SHOTGUN, YOUR PROBATION WOULD BE VIOLATED AND YOU'D BE SENT BACK WITH BURGLARY, ASSAULT, AND ARSON CHARGES ADDED. NOW, YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. SO YOU CONVENIENTLY CAME UP WITH A NAME THE POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR. RAY ELLSWORTH. OBJECTION AS LEADING AND SUGGESTIVE. MOVE TO STRIKE. YOUR HONOR, I'M MERELY TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE WITNESS' SITUATION AT THE TIME HE WAS BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING. ADMISSIBLE. ONLY, BE CAREFUL NOT TO LEAD THE WITNESS. YOU MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION. WELL, WHAT WAS IT AGAIN? [audience laughing] WERE YOU AFRAID OF BEING VIOLATED ON YOUR ASSAULT CHARGE? I WASN'T ANXIOUS TO GO BACK, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN. [audience laughing] NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. [Collier] THE WITNESS MAY STEP DOWN. THEY--THEY TOOK A PICTURE OUT OF THE STACK AND TOLD ME IT WAS ELLSWORTH. [Barnes] BUT DID EITHER OFFICER TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE A PARTICULAR PHOTOGRAPH? YEAH. I--I LOOKED AT THIS PICTURE AND THEN I THREW IT ASIDE. AND ONE OF THE COPS SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S RAY ELLSWORTH." AND HE PICKED IT UP AND HE PUT IT IN MY FACE. I SAID, "OOPS. OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW. YEAH, IT IS." ON MANY OCCASIONS, MISS SLAVEN, YOU LIED TO THE POLICE, DIDN'T YOU? YEAH, I DID. BUT ON THIS OCCASION, THE OFFICERS TOLD YOU THEY ONLY WANTED TO HEAR THE TRUTH, DID THEY NOT? YES. AND DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM THAT YOU SAW RAY ELLSWORTH THAT NIGHT IN LINDERO PARK WITH A SHOTGUN AND THAT YOU SAW HIM SHOOT THOSE 2 POLICEMEN? YEAH, I SAID THAT. [people murmuring] NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. MOLLY, WHEN YOU GO TO COURT AND SIT UP ON THE WITNESS STAND, DON'T YOU TAKE AN OATH TO TELL THE TRUTH, YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH? YES. YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT YOU LIKE TO LIE TO THE POLICE, THAT IT MADE YOU FEEL BIG AND BAD. YEAH. BUT YOU HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH ON SOME OCCASIONS. YES, I HAVE. WELL, MOLLY, HOW IS ANYBODY TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH? I'M NOT SURE WHEN I TELL THE TRUTH, SO HOW COULD ANYONE ELSE KNOW? [knocking on door] AH, MARSHALL. THANK YOU. THIS IS VANESSA. HELLO.HELLO. WE JUST BROUGHT HER IN FROM SAN DIEGO. UH, IS THIS ROOM, UH, BUGGED? CERTAINLY NOT. UH, UH, LISTEN, VANESSA, WOULD YOU MIND GOING OUT TO A BAR TO TALK INSTEAD? I DON'T MIND.OH, GOOD. I'LL BRING HIM BACK. HER.HER. ♪♪[light pop music playing on stereo] [waitress] WHAT CAN I GET YOU? I'LL HAVE A BRANDY.UH, A COLD BEER. OK, VANESSA, LET'S GET SOME THINGS STRAIGHT. RAY ALWAYS TREATED YOU LIKE A HUMAN BEING, BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN JAIL. AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT RAY NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN THE MURDERS. IT'S TRUE. RAY TREATED ME WELL. BUT AS FOR THE OTHER, I'M IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. IF I CHANGE MY STORY NOW, I'LL BE CHARGED WITH PERJURY. YOU WANT TO SEE RAY PUT AWAY FOR LIFE? WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST SPLIT. THEY'D FIND YOU. WELL, HOW ABOUT IF I CUT MY WRISTS? I'M SERIOUS. WHAT'S THE POINT IN DOING THAT? LOOK, I REALLY AM SORRY ABOUT RAY. BUT JAIL IS NOT A VERY PLEASANT PLACE FOR SOMEONE IN MY PHYSICAL CONDITION. THEY GIVE SHOCK TREATMENTS TO PEOPLE LIKE ME. [Barnes] WILL YOU NOW GIVE TO THE COURT THE ACTUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN YOU SAW LAGGING BEHIND THAT NIGHT IN LINDERO PARK? HE WAS TALL, BLACK, SHORT HAIR-- HE DID NOT HAVE AN AFRO? NO. AND HOW WAS HE DRESSED? LEVI JACKET AND PANTS AND WHITE CROSS-COUNTRY TYPE SHOES. DO YOU SEE THAT MAN ANYWHERE IN THIS COURTROOM? OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. THE PROSECUTOR LOOKED DIRECTLY AT MR. ELLSWORTH WHEN ASKING THE WITNESS TO IDENTIFY HIM. OVERRULED. BUT LET THE RECORD REFLECT THAT. CONTINUE. THE MAN YOU SAW THAT NIGHT RUNNING THROUGH THE PARK, WAS IT RAY ELLSWORTH? I'M NOT SURE. I DIDN'T SEE THE MAN CLEAR ENOUGH TO SAY IT WAS RAY ELLSWORTH. MR. MEDFORD, WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MAN YOU SAW LAGGING BEHIND IN THE PARK? YES. HE WAS TALL, THIN ON TOP, WEARING A LEVI JACKET AND PANTS, WHITE TENNIS SHOES, WITH BLACK STRIPES. YOU COULD, UH, YOU COULD SEE HIS SHOES THAT CLEARLY? YES. MY SON HAD JUST BOUGHT ME A PAIR OF BINOCULARS. I HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM. I SEE. UH, WHAT ELSE DID YOU SEE? WELL, AT ONE POINT, I SAW A MAN CROSS UNDER A TREE. HE STUMBLED AND FELL. ONE KNEE TOUCHED THE GROUND. AND IN A FEW MOMENTS, HE JUST DISAPPEARED. HE WAS GONE. THEN ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER, I SAW A POLICE CAR PARK ON THE CORNER WITH ITS LIGHTS OUT. SERGEANT MEDFORD, DO YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS OF DISLIKE FOR MR. ELLSWORTH? NO, NONE AT ALL. THANK YOU. ISN'T IT CORRECT, MR. MEDFORD, THAT AT THIS TIME YOU'RE FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THE MAN YOU SAW WAS NOT MR. ELLSWORTH? I DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS AT THE TIME, NOR DO I KNOW NOW. NOW, THE MAN YOU SAW, WHAT WAS HE WEARING? LEVI JACKET AND PANTS, DIRT SMUDGES ON THE KNEE, PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES TUCKED IN THE POCKET OF THE JACKET. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING, UH, UNUSUAL ABOUT THE MAN? DID HE ACT NERVOUS? HE WAS SWEATING PROFUSELY. I ASKED HIM WHY HE WAS SO OUT OF BREATH. HE SAID HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN A HURRY. NOW, AFTER THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECTS CAME OVER THE RADIO, WHAT DID YOU DO THEN? I TOLD MR. ELLSWORTH THAT HE WAS FREE TO GO. HAD MANDY KUBELIK NOT MISLED THE POLICE AS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LAGGING MAN SHE SAW, WOULD YOU HAVE HELD MR. ELLSWORTH? YES, SIR. HE WOULD HAVE FIT THE DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE SUSPECTS. THANK YOU, SERGEANT. MISS KUBELIK AND MR. MEDFORD INDICATED THAT THE SUSPECT WAS WEARING WHITE TENNIS SHOES WITH BLACK STRIPES. WHAT KIND OF SHOES WAS MR. ELLSWORTH WEARING WHEN YOU STOPPED HIM? I THINK THEY WERE WHITE SNEAKERS. YOU THINK. ARE YOU CERTAIN THEY WERE WHITE SNEAKERS? THAT'S THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD OF THEM. WOULD IT REFRESH YOUR MEMORY TO LOOK AT YOUR TESTIMONY FROM THE PRELIMINARY HEARING? I BELIEVE I INDICATED THAT THEY WERE, UH, LIGHT BROWN IN COLOR. YOU STATED, UNDER OATH, THAT THEY WERE BROWN LEATHER, DUSTY, BUT NOT EXTREMELY DIRTY. [people murmuring] SERGEANT BOWIE, WHEN YOU STOPPED RAY ELLSWORTH, HE WAS WEARING BROWN SHOES, WASN'T HE? YES. [people murmuring] [doorbell ringing] MRS. HOYT?YES? I'M PAUL MARSHALL. I'M RAY ELLSWORTH'S ATTORNEY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WELL, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR HUSBAND. HE ISN'T FEELING WELL. JUST WAIT A MINUTE, AND I'LL TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE HERE. [Paul] THANK YOU. UM, MY HUSBAND IS ASLEEP. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN SUCH A NIGHTMARE. YEAH. DID ELLSWORTH SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT THE PEARSON SHOOTING? THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY AS LEADER OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO TAKE RETRIBUTION AGAINST THE POLICE. [Barnes] DID HE INDICATE TO YOU THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING OF THOSE 2 POLICEMEN? YEAH. HE SAID, "I'LL TELL YOU HOW I DID IT." WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID HE-- HE HID BEHIND THE BUSHES AND... EXCUSE ME. WHEN THE COPS DROVE UP, HE JUST SHOT THEM LIKE ANIMALS. I CAN'T... YOU LYIN' PUNK, YOU NEED TO CRY. NO, NO, NO, MR. ELLSWORTH. MR. FERGUSON, CAN YOU GO AHEAD? HE... HE SAID THAT HE SHOT OFFICER GIBBS AT POINT-BLANK RANGE IN THE CHEST. [sobs] AND THEN OFFICER MARTENSEN WAS FIRING HIS HANDGUN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR WHEN HE SHOT HIM. [sniffles] THANK YOU. YOU REQUESTED TO SPEAK WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AGENTS. UH, DID YOU THINK THAT WAS GONNA HELP YOU IN ANY WAY? [clearing throat] IF YOU MEAN DID THEY PROMISE ME ANYTHING, NO! TELL ME, MR. FERGUSON, WHY DOES A JAILHOUSE INFORMER TESTIFY AGAINST A FELLOW INMATE? I--I CAN'T SAY. I--I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HURT TO COME FORWARD. RAY ELLSWORTH WOULD NEVER HAVE CONFIDED IN A KNOWN SNITCH. HE FELT THAT HE HAD GAINED MY TRUST. DON'T YOU THINK IT A LITTLE BIT ODD THAT THE DAY AFTER YOU HAD YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AGENTS THAT YOU RECEIVED YOUR PAROLE PAPERS? I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE ANYWAY. THE--THE TIMING JUST HAPPENED TO BE COINCIDENTAL. LIFE IS FULL OF COINCIDENCE. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER RAY ELLSWORTH REFERRING TO THE POLICE AS "WHITE PIG BASTARDS." AND ALSO, ANYONE WHO WANTED TO BE A COP WAS SICK "AND NEEDED TO BE KILLED." [clears throat] AND IF HE HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, HE WOULD. YOUR HONOR, MAY I APPROACH THE BENCH? GO AHEAD. I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE WITNESS IS PERJURING HERSELF. [Paul] WHEN I SPOKE TO HER BEFORE THE TRIAL, SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD LIED BECAUSE OF THREATS MADE BY THE POLICE. NOW IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO HER OFF THE RECORD, MAYBE SHE'D TELL YOU ABOUT THE BIND SHE'S UNDER. VERY WELL. WE'LL ADJOURN TO CHAMBERS. [gavel pounding] THE COURT WILL RECESS FOR 10 MINUTES. JUDGE COLLIER, I FEEL VERY BAD ABOUT BEING IN THIS POSITION, BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN DO. I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO RESPECT THE LAW, BUT AFTER MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE POLICE, I FEEL I CAN NEVER TRUST A POLICE OFFICER, A D.A., OR A JUDGE AGAIN. YOU CAN TRUST ME. IF YOU PUT ME BACK UP ON THAT STAND AND ASK ME WHETHER I WAS PRESSURED BY THE POLICE TO TESTIFY, I'M STILL GOING TO ANSWER EXACTLY AS I WAS TOLD TO DO, BECAUSE IT'S STILL MY LIFESTYLE I HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THE COURT AND THE PENAL SYSTEM'S IGNORANCE OF MY MEDICAL CONDITION HAS BROUGHT ME NOTHING BUT GRIEF AND PAIN. [Collier] I DON'T UNDERESTIMATE YOUR PROBLEMS, BUT MR. ELLSWORTH HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF MURDERING 2 POLICE OFFICERS. HIS LIFE IS AT STAKE. AND SO IS MINE. IN THE RAT RACE I LIVE IN, IT'S STILL SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I'M DEFINITELY NOT MYSELF TODAY. AND ANYTIME I ENTER A COURTROOM, I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE. ALL I KEEP REMEMBERING IS THOSE POLICE OFFICERS AND THEIR GUNS AND THE WAY THEY TREATED ME. [man] OFFICER HOYT, YOUR MIND IS LIKE A TAPE RECORDER. UNDER HYPNOSIS, IT HAS EVERYTHING RECORDED IN IT. LET YOUR MIND GO BACK. [Hoyt] I SAW THIS GUY RUNNING TOWARD ME. FROM A DISTANCE, HE LOOKED LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. I'M NOT SURE IF I REALLY SAW RAY ELLSWORTH IN THE PARK THAT NIGHT, OR IF IT'S JUST IN MY MIND THAT I SAW HIM. THAT GUY SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SCARED. [Paul] THE PROSECUTION'S KEY WITNESS. HE WAITED 7 WEEKS TO COME FORWARD WITH THIS INFORMATION. WHAT, YOU THINK HE'S LYING? THEY HYPNOTIZED HIM. HE'S GOT ALL THAT GUILT STEWING INSIDE OF HIM. HE TELLS A STORY, THEY CLOSE UP HIS MIND. TOMORROW I'M GONNA TRY AND OPEN IT UP AGAIN. MR. MARSHALL. I'M OFFICER HOYT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. YOU'RE RIGHT. AFTER HEARING OFFICER MARTENSEN'S SCREAMS FOR HELP OVER THE RADIO, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO REACH THE PARK? APPROXIMATELY 6 MINUTES. AND AFTER PARKING, WHAT DID YOU DO THEN? UH, I SHUT OFF MY HEADLIGHTS AND SIREN, GOT OUT OF THE CAR, I LOCKED THE DOOR, AND I STARTED TO CROSS THE STREET. I DECIDED THAT I'D BETTER GET MY SHOTGUN. SO I--I WENT TO MY CAR, UNLOCKED THE DOOR, GOT OUT THE GUN, LOCKED THE DOOR AGAIN AND STARTED INTO THE PARK, UH, ABOUT 200 FEET, TO A POINT WHERE I ENCOUNTERED A MAN RUNNING TOWARDS ME. IS THAT MAN IN THIS COURTROOM NOW? AND IF SO, WOULD YOU POINT HIM OUT TO ME? YES, HE IS. YOU LYING REDNECK DEVIL!HEY, RAY. NOW, QUIET, MR. ELLSWORTH. I WILL NOT BE QUIET! THAT MAN IS LYING AND YOU KNOW HE'S-- I'M WARNING YOU, MR. ELLSWORTH, YOU KEEP THIS UP, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT OF COURT. I AM IN CONTEMPT! OF THIS WHOLE DAMN COURT! I HAVE BEEN OVER 2 YEARS LOCKED UP FOR SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T DO. [gavel pounding] [Collier] WILL THE MARSHAL PLEASE REMOVE HIM FROM THE COURTROOM....RACIST FRAME-UP! [people chattering][Collier] ORDER! ORDER! [gavel pounding] ORDER! ORDER IN THIS COURTROOM! [Paul] BEFORE YOU ENCOUNTERED SERGEANT BOWIE, DID YOU HEAR HIS CALL FOR ASSISTANCE? [Hoyt] YES, I DID. AND YOU RESPONDED, "L-5, I'M AT GRACE AND DEARBORN." I COULD HAVE SAID THAT, YES. AND YOU HEARD A RESPONSE FROM BOWIE TO SEE HIM ON GRACE? YES. A TAPE OF THE POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSION ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER SHOWED THAT YOUR CALL HAD BEEN MADE SOME 8 AND A HALF MINUTES AFTER MARTENSEN'S CRY FOR HELP AND THAT SERGEANT BOWIE'S CALL THAT HE WAS STOPPING ELLSWORTH CAME 10 MINUTES AFTER MARTENSEN'S PLEA, 90 SECONDS AFTER YOUR CALL. LET'S SAY, FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, THAT YOU'D DRIVEN A 3RD OF A MILE TO THE SPOT AT THE PARK. [Paul] YOU PARKED AND LOCKED YOUR CAR, WENT BACK TO GET YOUR GUN, LOCKED YOUR CAR AGAIN, WALKED 200 FEET, AND QUESTIONED ELLSWORTH, ALL WITHIN 45 SECONDS. THAT WOULD LEAVE ELLSWORTH 45 SECONDS TO GET TO THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS STOPPED BY BOWIE, A QUARTER-MILE AWAY. THE WORLD RECORD FOR RUNNING THE QUARTER MILE IS 44.5 SECONDS. I'LL BET IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN RAY ELLSWORTH, FULLY CLOTHED, CONSIDERABLY LONGER. AND BOWIE TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS WALKING WHEN THEY MET. OFFICER HOYT, WHY DID IT TAKE YOU 7 WEEKS TO COME FORWARD WITH YOUR STORY? WASN'T IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAD ENCOUNTERED RAY ELLSWORTH, IT WAS IN YOUR MIND, YOU'D THOUGHT YOU HAD? I'M NOT SURE. DO YOU SUFFER FROM RACIAL PREJUDICE? I DON'T BELIEVE SO, SIR. YOU DON'T BELIEVE SO. LOOK, I'M NOT A RACIST. I JUST BOUGHT A HOME NEXT TO A BLACK FAMILY. [people laughing] ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 12, 1971, YOU WERE LOOKING FOR BLACKS, WEREN'T YOU? YES, SIR. AND, AS A MATTER OF FACT, TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS, YOU WERE LOOKING FOR NIGGERS, WEREN'T YOU? YES, SIR. AND, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU WANTED TO KILL SOME NIGGERS, DIDN'T YOU? OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, AS BEING IMMATERIAL. YOUR HONOR, THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TAPE RECORDINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENTERED INTO EVIDENCE BY THE PROSECUTOR. OBJECTION OVERRULED. WOULD IT REFRESH YOUR MEMORY AS TO YOUR STATEMENT IF I... IF I LET YOU LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TAPE RECORDINGS? I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL.WELL, LET'S TRY. IS YOUR RECOLLECTION REFRESHED REGARDING WHAT YOU FELT ABOUT NIGGERS ON APRIL 12, 1971? YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. ON THAT DATE, DID YOU WANT TO KILL A NIGGER? UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PROBABLY YES. AND DID YOU FEEL YOU WANTED TO KILL HIM, I QUOTE, "MORE THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED TO DO IN MY WHOLE LIFE, I WANNA KILL A NIGGER"? AT THAT TIME AND THAT POINT IN MY LIFE, YES, SIR. [people murmuring] EMILY, WILL YOU TELL THE COURT WHAT YOU SAW AT ABOUT 9:15 ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 12,1971? WELL, I WAS OUT ON MY PORCH, AND I HEARD A SOUND LIKE, LIKE THE BACKFIRE OF A CAR. IT WAS COMIN' FROM THE PARK. AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I STARTED TO GO BACK INSIDE AND I LOOKED THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AND I SAW A CAR DRIVE UP IN FRONT OF MR. ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE. AND A YOUNG MAN GOT OUT AND RAN UP TO THE DOOR AND MR. ELLSWORTH HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND THEN THE YOUNG MAN WENT BACK TO HIS CAR AND DROVE AWAY. IN A FEW SECONDS, MR. ELLSWORTH COME RUNNIN' OUT OF THE HOUSE, PUTTIN' ON HIS JACKET, AND RAN TOWARD THE PARK. [Paul] AND WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN THAT THE 2 POLICEMEN HAD BEEN AMBUSHED IN THE PARK? [Emily] THE NEXT DAY ON THE NEWS.MMM-HMM. AND WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT RAY ELLSWORTH HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH THOSE MURDERS? OH, A FEW WEEKS LATER, IN THE NEWSPAPER. WELL, EMILY, WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP FORWARD AND TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOU SAW? WELL, I'VE BEEN VERY SICK, AND, UH, I'VE BEEN CONFINED TO MY BED FOR A LONG TIME. UH, BUT I THOUGHT SINCE MR. ELLSWORTH AND I WERE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS, THE POLICE WOULD COME AND ASK ME QUESTIONS, BUT NOBODY DID. [people chattering] AT SOME POINT IN TIME, MRS. TYSON, YOU HAD TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT MR. ELLSWORTH WAS CHARGED WITH MURDER. YES, BUT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE WAS IN JAIL THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR BEFORE YOU BOTHERED TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT. WHAT WERE YOU WAITING FOR? I HAVE A BAD HEART AND I WAS SICK IN BED MOST OF THAT TIME. AND I FIGURED SOMEONE WOULD CONTACT ME. WELL, DID YOU BOTHER TO HAVE YOUR HUSBAND CALL THE POLICE OR MAYBE EVEN WRITE A LETTER? OH, NO, NO. MY HUSBAND, BECAUSE OF MY ILL HEALTH, WOULDN'T WANT ME TO GET INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, THAT JUST WASN'T VERY NEIGHBORLY OF YOU, MRS. TYSON, TO LET POOR MR. ELLSWORTH SIT IN JAIL ALL THAT TIME WHEN ALL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN WAS A PHONE CALL. AS I LOOK BACK, I SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEONE, BUT I KNEW MR. ELLSWORTH WAS INNOCENT, AND I WAS SURE HE'D BE RELEASED. PAUL. I DIDN'T KILL THOSE 2 POLICEMEN. NO, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, YOUR COMMITMENT TO ME. YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND, PAUL. AND I FEEL A, I FEEL A KINSHIP WITH YOU THAT I'VE NEVER FELT WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN MY WIFE. THANKS, RAY. THANKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THE MAN WHO SHOT ADAM GIBBS AND BEN MARTENSEN IS RAYMOND ELLSWORTH. HE IS THE ONE WHO LAGGED BEHIND AS THE OTHER GUNMEN FLED, DROPPING HIS SHOTGUN ALONG THE WAY. THE SHOTGUN THAT GERALD STEELE ADMITTED STEALING, SELLING TO HIM, THE SAME SHOTGUN THAT HE USED TO PUMP 3 ROUNDS OF DOUBLE-OUGHT BUCK INTO THE BODIES OF GIBBS AND MARTENSEN. RAYMOND ELLSWORTH, WEARING A LEVI JACKET AND PANTS AND WHITE TENNIS SHOES, FITS THE EXACT DESCRIPTION THAT 4 WITNESSES, WITNESSES KUBELIK, MEDFORD, HOYT, AND BOWIE, ALL SAW RUNNING ACROSS THE PARK THAT NIGHT. OFFICER HOYT ENCOUNTERED ELLSWORTH. NOW, THAT WAS OUR FIRST CHANCE WITH MR. ELLSWORTH, BUT BECAUSE HOYT WAS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED, ELLSWORTH MANAGED TO PASS. THEN WE HAD A 2ND CHANCE, WITH SERGEANT BOWIE. AND AGAIN, ELLSWORTH PASSED, BECAUSE BOWIE DIDN'T KNOW THEN WHAT YOU KNOW NOW. BUT YOU NOW KNOW EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. AND IT IS THEREFORE YOU WHO NOW MUST COME BACK AND WITH YOUR VERDICT SAY, "THIS TIME, MR. ELLSWORTH, YOU DO NOT PASS." I WANT YOU TO GO AND DELIBERATE. AND WHEN YOU RETURN, ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, TELL THE WHOLE WORLD THAT RAYMOND ELLSWORTH IS GUILTY OF THE MURDERS OF ADAM GIBBS AND BEN MARTENSEN. THANK YOU. YOU'VE SEEN THE POWER AND THE ENORMOUS WEIGHT OF THE MACHINERY OF THE PROSECUTION. WHEN 2 POLICE OFFICERS ARE KILLED AND WEEKS TURN INTO MONTHS AND NO ONE HAS BEEN CAUGHT, THERE'S A LOT OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION. AND WHEN SOMEONE WANTS SOMETHING TO BE TRUE, IN THEIR MINDS IT BECOMES TRUE. WHEN THE POLICE WANTED IT TO BE TRUE THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT PERSON, IN THEIR MINDS THEY MADE IT TRUE. THEY DESIGNED THE CASE, NOT IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE, BUT IN THEIR INTEREST. THEY WANTED SOMEBODY CONVICTED. THE STATE'S WITNESSES, STEELE, HAWKINS, SLAVEN, FERGUSON, AND VANESSA, EACH HAVE THEIR REASONS FOR LYING. THEY TOLD SO MANY STORIES SO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES. THEN THERE WAS OFFICER HOYT. I WONDER, HOW MUCH DID HOYT'S DESIRE TO BE A PART OF THE HISTORY OF THIS CASE MOTIVATE HIM. AND HOW MUCH DID HIS BIAS MOTIVATE HIM? HE ADMITTED THAT WHAT WAS FOREMOST IN HIS MIND THAT NIGHT WAS THAT HE WANTED TO KILL A NIGGER. MORE THAN ANYTHING HE'D EVER WANTED TO DO IN HIS WHOLE LIFE. TO SIT IN A COURT OF LAW AND SEE THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS CASE, CHARGING MURDER, HINGE ON THE TESTIMONY OF A MAN IN THAT STATE OF MIND... WHEW. WE'VE ALL BEEN HUMILIATED HERE. IT IS OUR SHAME THAT WHEN THIS ALL BEGAN WE DIDN'T JUST FOLD OUR BRIEFCASES AND GO HOME. JUST GO HOME AND TELL RAY ELLSWORTH TO GO HOME TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS WORK. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO PLEASE ANYBODY. YOU'RE HERE TO DO JUSTICE IN THIS CASE. AND IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE THAT RAY ELLSWORTH IS GUILTY, THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME BACK INTO THIS COURTROOM AND DELIVER THAT VERDICT. BUT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT PROVE THIS. YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW IT. RAY ELLSWORTH IS NOT GUILTY. YOU'RE IN A TEMPLE OF JUSTICE. THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE IS. MAYBE I'M NAIVE, BUT I'M GONNA REMAIN THAT NAIVE. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THE EVIDENCE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL DO JUSTICE. THANK YOU. THE COURT WILL RECESS WHILE THE JURY DELIBERATES. [gavel pounding] WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T READ THEIR FACES. YOU'VE GOTTEN MORE EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH THIS ONE THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE, HUH?YEAH. I'VE BROKEN THE CARDINAL RULE FOR LAWYERS. I'VE COME TO CARE ABOUT THE MAN. MR. MARSHALL. THEY'VE REACHED A VERDICT. [people chattering] [door opening] [gavel pounding] MEMBERS OF THE JURY, HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR. WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE RISE? WILL YOU PLEASE READ THE VERDICT TO THE COURT? "WE, THE JURY, FIND THE DEFENDANT RAY ELLSWORTH NOT GUILTY." [all cheering] ORDER. [gavel pounding] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ORDER! I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY FOR THEIR EXEMPLARY CONDUCT THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL. THANK YOU ALL. [all cheering] [laughing] PAUL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, PAUL. WE'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE.OK.
