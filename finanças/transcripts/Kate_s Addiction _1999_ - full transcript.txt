Like a fund-raiser? Yeah, it's a foundation for... So I don't think you got anything to worry about. Seems like she's in love. You ok? Get out. What, I do something wrong? Just get out! Jesus, Kate. What did you do to your hair? Oh, my god! Ohh! You look hot! I love it! Ooh. Where are you goin'? To visit a friend in California. You want to come? I was thinking of taking the convertible. Fuck! I've got finals still. Well, that's too bad. Guess I'm gonna have to smoke this all by myself. I've got 2 more finals. I can't just blow them off... Can I? You should. I could.

Fuckin' any guy ever hit me, I would bail on his ass. Dude, aren't we goin' in? We've gotta get you to a hotel. A hotel? All right. Look, I'm not talking about this anymore, ok? Just watch a movie or something. I'll call you. Hi. Is Sara home? Uh, you know what? She's... She's actually busy. Is there something I can do for you? Can you sign here? Yeah. Excuse me. I'm Kate. Kate mcgrath. Kate? From New Orleans Kate? Gosh, you look... You look so different... From, uh, from the pictures. Please, come in, come in. Come in. Thanks. she is going to be so excited to see you. Well, me being here is sort of a surprise. All right, well, listen, I'll make you a deal. Take this into the kitchen, add ice, and I'll keep your surprise. I think I can handle that. Ok, great. Looks like I'm right on time. I'm Ezra. You live here, too? Naw, Dylan's my brother. Hey, bro. Hey. I see you've met Kate. Yeah. I thought you were on your way to mammoth. Got to borrow a briefcase. What, is that some sort of new mountain bike equipment? Not going. Why do you need a briefcase? Got a call about meeting with these 2 finance dudes from bike Wells, about the doughnut. It's a bike seat I designed. Hole in the middle the relieve pressure. File for a patent? I ride with their brother. We're straight. You're "straight"? E, you've gotta cover your tail on this. Dude, no one's gonna steal my idea. Why are you so paranoid all the time? I'm not paranoid. It's just smart business. Honey, where'd you put the dry cleaning? Kate. Hey. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What are you do... Your hair. Yeah. I mean, it looks great. Surprise. I can't believe you're here. Ha ha. Well, I didn't miss your birthday. What's the occasion? Oh. Oh, it's Friday. I get flowers every Friday. Yuck. Look at him taking the credit. Our parents are in the flower biz.Ah. He should take the credit. It's sweet. Dude, does this thing, like, ever come off? We're going to a party tonight at the met. Yeah, it's a benefit for the abused children's foundation. Since when do you go to benefits? Since I need the write-offs and it's for a good cause. Here you go. Cool. thank you. Ok, you got it? Uh, wait. Ready? Toast time! Oy. For a good cause. It's gonna be great. Well, for 6 bills, it should be. How did you know? Hmm? The... the price. 600. How did you know how much it was gonna cost? Because I'm going. You are? Yeah, you know, when you give to one non-profit organization, you get on all the lists. So you came all the way out to California for a non-profit fund-raiser. I had ulterior motives. Thanks. I was hoping I could convince Sara to take a little road trip up the coast right before she moves back, you know? "Moves back"? Yeah. We're opening up the flower shop in New Orleans. Didn't you tell him? Ooh. Look at the time. Gotta run. I'm sure we'll be seeing you around. Count on it. Cool. Bye. Tonight. All right, wait. I gotta write this down. So, what made you decide to cut your hair, fin... What? Well, they want to talk about the follow-up account. That's great.Tonight. Tonight? I know. Well, can't it wait until Monday? Uh, she says that she's the east coast rep and that she's only here for the weekend. And she calls you on a Friday night? I know. I guess you guys are gonna have to go without me. I'll make sure Sara has a really good time. Dylan says the executive didn’t even show up. Well, that's weird. Well, let's go get you set up in the guest room. I really love your place. Thanks. A shame you’re gonna be leaving it. Uh, yeah. I... i meant to call you about that. I'm... I'm not sure that I'm coming back. What? Well, my parents helped me buy this place, and I like it here, and Dylan, and... Sara. I know, it's just I didn't count on this happening. Well, what exactly is happening? We agreed when I finished finals, we'd open a flower shop in New Orleans. What happened to that? The first time in my life, I'm happy... Who I am, where I live. I'm happy here. So, happiness is a geographical thing? You really put me in a tight spot here, Sara. I already signed the papers with the landlord on that space in Jackson square, the space that you wanted. I'm sorry. This is really hard for me. Well, that should tell you something right there. You belong in New Orleans. Your parents are there, I'm there. But Dylan's here. You'll meet somebody else. Not like him. He's conservative, Sara. Since when do you date conservative guys? Hi. Hi. How'd it go? I'm sorry I woke you. What about your meeting? Oh, um... I called Tom, and he doesn't know of any new executive on the account. Then who called? You got me. Listen, um... About what Kate said... Yeah. Were you ever gonna tell me? Well, we were gonna open a flower shop in New Orleans. When I met Ezra down at the flower mart, I was kind of there doing research. Wait a minute. You were out in California for research to open a shop in New Orleans? Well, no. I came out here on vacation, and then I met you and... And what? I'm not going anywhere. That's good. That is good news. God, I can’t believe that's her. I know. It's weird. She seems different. Yeah, she is. She looks normal. No, it's more than the haircut. It's something else. Yeah, maybe you’ve changed. You know? I mean, now that you've spent time apart from her, maybe you've grown apart. It happens. Well, I didn't tell you how we first met. Yes, you did. You guys went to high school together. Uh, that's not the whole story. Well, what is it? Tell me a story. God, I thought I knew everything about you. I was 15... And I was pregnant. Whoa, by Kate? God, she has changed. I'm sorry. That's all right. It was a long time ago. Anyway, I took the test... You know, the pregnancy test... In a stall in the bathroom at school, and I didn't know what I was gonna do. I started walking home, and she pulled up in this brand-new convertible. And I didn't know who she was. She just started talking to me, and I told her, and it turned out we had classes together. Um, but she was one of those people, you know... I hate to say this, it sounds so awful... But she was kind of invisible. Well, we had invisible people in high school, too. Yeah. Anyway... She took care of everything. She forged signatures, she had her uncle take me to the clinic. She just handled it. Done. She took care of me. We've been friends ever since. Well, there's a new sheriff in town, darlin', and I'll be taking care of you from here on out. You better. I will. Sleep with angels. I sleep with one every night. Hey, you're up early. It's almost lunch time in New Orleans. Where are you headed? Oh, I'm gonna go play golf with my boss. You two have a good time last night? Of course. I was with Sara. Can I talk to you for a minute? What's up? All right, um, Saturday will be our... You know, it's hard to call it our anniversary... But Saturday will be 6 months that we’ve been together. And you want to buy her something nice, right? I want to buy her an engagement ring. You ok? Yeah. I'm just really happy for her. I was thinking about a nice emerald, surrounded by diamonds. E was gonna help me pick it out, but, I mean, since you two are such good friends, I figured... I'd be glad to help you pick out a ring. Good. Good morning. Morning. All right. I gotta get going. I thought that your tee time was at 10. Uh, well, Tom wanted to meet for a bite to eat at the country club. Oh. Really? At the club? Yes, darling, at the club. I have a great idea. What do you say we all go for Sushi tonight? I got this thing for Sushi. He has a thing for saki. Sushi sounds great. Great. I'll call him from the car and see if he and, um... Oh, god, what’s her name again? Shelly. right! Shelly can join us. I'll see you guys later. Bye, hon.Bye. Um, thanks. So, how'd you sleep? I'm really sorry about last night. The whole... Not-moving-home thing really threw me for a loop. No, no, Kate, really, I should Bethe one to apologize. I mean, I-I should've called you. I should've told you. No. You know, if this guy's the one, I'm really happy for you. I'm a little jealous, but I'm really happy. It's hard to explain. I... I fell in love with him, seriously, the second I saw him. Just... Wait till you meet that special person. Maybe I already have. Oh, really? Do I know this person? Well, it's... Somebody I've known for a really long time. Mm-hmm. Sex is incredible. Well, you know, sex isn't everything. Well, it sure is something, though. I hear you. Will you zip me up? Sure. You got it? Yeah. There you go. You look great. Thanks. So do you. Thanks. Oh, that must be Ezra and... Shelly. Shelly. You ready? Yeah. I just need to call my service, so can I use your phone? Yeah, go ahead. Margarita? You're kidding, right? Yeah, it's me. Hang on a second. So do you think she'll like it? Are you kidding? She's going to love it. I-I'm scared it's too big. Trust me, size does matter, all the time. Nice. Uh... Isn't... isn't the car back this way? Hey, you know, I want to take a little walk. I want to get to know the man who's taking away my best friend. I'm not taking her away. You know what I mean. Right through here. Where are we going? There's this cute little cafe at the end of the alley. Well, it must be new. Huh? I said it must be new. Yeah. I was... I had breakfast here the other day. What's wrong? I don't know. I think that guy's following us. Oh, your brother's right. You are definitely paranoid. Paranoia's part of the equation here in L.A. It's called survival. Sweetie, I'm from new Orleans, ok? The last time I checked, we were still the murder capital of the world. So why don't you tell me how you're going to ask her. Uh... I don't know. I was thinking about a romantic weekend, just north of Malibu. Can I help you? Give me the ring! Don't fuck with me, asshole, or I'll cut you! Give me the ring! Give it to her, Dylan. She might have a gun. Just relax. Just hang on. Give me the fucking ring! Kate! Where the fuck is the gun? I'm not going to shoot nobody! You bring a butter knife, you stupid bitch? Fuck! Kate, what are we going to do? He's hurt pretty bad. My god! What did you do? Oh, god! Fuck! Why did you do that? I'm sorry! Oh, Jesus, you're bleeding! Kill him. Fucking kill him! Finish him off! Uhh! No! Fucking do it! I can't do it! You want me to bleed to death? No. That a girl. Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. What are you doing? These are my pictures! I know. I just thought that... Well... Don't! I know how you feel... You have no idea what I am feeling! How long are we going to do this? How long are you going to keep denying what happened? You haven't mentioned his name. It's been over 2 months. I didn't realize there was a timetable. He's gone. That's the timetable. I want you to leave. What? Get out. This is pathetic. He's fucking dead! Get out! Leave me alone! It's ok. I miss him so much, Kate. I know. But I'm here. I'm here for you. Kate. What are you doing here? Uh, I was just looking for Sara. So you just walk in? Nobody answered the door. You can't just walk in. You don't live here. And you do? Yeah, I do. Get the fuck out of here. Tcch. Fuck you. You wish. Sara, it's e. I'm just kind of bluesin' lately about... You know. I thought maybe we could hang out or something. I'm going to go down to Montana, and maybe get something for my mom. Page me or meet me, ok? Message just been erased. That's a really pretty necklace. Hi, e. I, uh... I just wanted to say I was sorry about before. Being in the hospital and losing your brother, I've just been so freaked out. Well, I just didn’t want Sara to know we’ve been fighting. Yeah, I guess. So can we put this behind us... Like friends do, right? 'Cause we are friends, you know? I mean, I hope you feel the same way. It's all good. All right. So are you going to buy that for your mom? No, no. Sara was looking at it the other day. I was going to, you know, but 400 beans, you know? Well, I just came down hereto tell you I was sorry. I'll catch you later, all right? All right. Last round, last round. Let's go. Come on, come on. Knock him out. Knock him out. Aah! That was incredible. You're a great cook. What? You have a little... Uh, something. Hey, it's mine, mine, mine. So why did you do all of this? I wanted to do something nice for you. I am such a shit. Oh, don't say that. No, I am. You've been so great through this whole thing, and I've just... Just don’t apologize ever. Why are you so good to me? 'Cause I love you. I love you, too. Oh, I got it. No, you just relax. I'll get it. Ok. I got to pee. Hola? Kate, it's Ezra. Is Sara home? Hello? Kate, what's up? Is she there? Hi. No, she's not. Well, uh, you know when she'll be home? No. Uh, do you want me to take a message? Just tell her I called... Again. Ok? Who was that? Oh, they hung up. Are you ready... For a little dessert? Where did you get that? Ok, all right. But we can't go anywhere, because I don't want to freak out in public. Oh, you're not going to freak out. I'll tell you what, you mix us up some more margis, I'm going to use the bathroom. I'll meet you on the couch. Deal. I can't believe I'm doing this. Oh, give me a break. We used to always get high. We used to smoke all the time. No, you used to smoke all the time. Oh, yeah? What about Mr., uh... Football guy? What the fuck was his name? What, Snyder? No, no. Remember this guy, the guy that... The guy that had that crappy convertible, and he had the t-shirts for seat covers? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ables. You guys used to smoke-up all the time. So what did you want to tell me? What? I don't know. You had to tell me something. Oh, right, right, right. I don't remember what it was. You are so stoned. Ok. No, wait. Oh, remember that shop where you tried on that green dress, you know, with the straps in the back? You mean the $500 crappy-green dress with the straps in the back? That'd be the one. It's for sale. I wouldn't pay 20 bucks for that dress. No, the shop, stupid. We could open up the flower shop here. In California? Yeah. But I already signed the lease for the shop in New Orleans. Yeah, but you can get out of the lease. And you love it here. The weather's great. The pace is great. You could learn to surf. Ugh. Nobody's doing it in the neighborhood. We could make a killing. I mean, not that, you know, money means anything to you, but... Is that what you really want? Yeah. I mean, together... Together we can do anything. Does that mean you want to stay? I'll go wherever you want me to go. Oh, good. All right, all right, all right. All right, so tomorrow we'll go down to the store, ok? We'll talk to the owner about the rent. Then all we have to do is, we get a license, and we file for a fictitious name, and... what? It's just been so long since I've seen you smile like this. Close your eyes. Why? I've got a surprise for you. Close 'em. It's not another joint, is it? No... just... what... Close 'em. Stoner. Open 'em. You like it? I love it. I saw it in the store. How did you... Let's go see how it looks. Ok. Huh. The bulb must be burned out. We can use the mirror in my bedroom. Wait. I got it. Let me help you. That joint really kicked my butt. Oh, god, Katie, it's beautiful. You're beautiful. I like this place right here. Oh, god. I'm definitely stoned. Um... I better go to bed. Night. Fuck. God. She home? Uh, no, she's, um... Oh, I guess she is home. Morning, Sara. How are you? Look who's here. Well, you might know that if you would have called me back last night. Last night? Dude, I called. I talked to Kate. We got a little nailed last night. Pretty much don’t remember anything. So how's your mom? You know, she's dealing. My dad acts like nothing's happened. Well, what are you doing right now? Maybe we can see them for lunch. I know they'd love to see you. Sara, I thought we were gonna to check out the store today? What, you going shopping? We're opening a flower shop. Sara found a cute place for us. Why don't we do that tomorrow? I mean, uh, the realtor's probably not even open on Sunday. Let's go. What's up? You coming or not? Uh... I left my purse inside. Well, go get it. I'll meet you there. Did you get my flower? Yeah. Thanks. You ok? Kate, I can't do this now. I-I just can't. You already did. Hi. Hey. Margarita? No, thanks. So you decided to stay for dinner, huh? What? Yeah. Um... Listen, did, um... Did e. Call me anytime other than last night? Yeah, I told you. No, you didn't. Yeah, I left you a note. Somewhere. Sorry. It got stuck. I could have sworn I told you. Um, he also said that he left some messages on the machine. I know. This fucking machine is broken. My accountant called and said she left 2 or 3 messages. I never got them either. Hmm. Hey, Sara, sit down for a second. I, um, I puta down payment on the shop. I was waiting for you to get home so we could go together, but... All you have to do is sign and we're in business. Kate, we should talk. I know. About last night... You don't have to say anything. I think we both feel the same way. You do? Our friendship is... Well, I don't ever want to lose that. Especially not, you know, to something like last night. I think we were both really drunk. Among other things. What's a little sex between friends? Ok, good. I'm so glad that we talked about this, because I was really nervous. I didn't know what to do. Tell me about it. I was waiting here all day just wigging out, not sure what I was going to say, how I was going to act. Really? Of course really. All you have to do is sign. Well, how much was it? Don't worry about that. I-I know that you can afford it, but I just want to make sure that, you know, we split everything. Would you please sign your name. To... Our new business. My new partner. Would you stop hanging on me. What? What is... What's wrong with you? You're going to have to go on without me. Where am I going? Home. Home. Kate, is there something that you're not telling me... About Sara? Look, Sara's not doing so good. Ok? I want to go home with you, but her mom asked me to stay here a little while longer, just to see if I can get her to move back. You sure that's it? What are you talking about? What am I talking... Come on, Kate, look at her. She's a fucking hottie. Is there something going on? No. Because if there's something going on... There's nothing! All right? I am just trying to help out a friend. If it was you, I'd do the fucking same thing for you! So why don't you just get off my back. I'm sorry. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Hit the bag. Come on. Hit it. Hit it. Let's go, right here. Right here, let's go. Oh, you want some of me! Right. Come on.Left. Right. Knock him out. Come on. Come on. Hit me. Knock him out. Think about somebody. Put a face on it. What do you want? I'm just getting in my car, lady. Don't blow a gasket. Oh... sorry. Besides, the way you hit the bag in there, no way am I sneaking up on you. Oh, right. You're... You're in my class. Yeah, with Julian. You need some help? Uh, I don't know. I don't know what's wrong. Well, why don't you pop the hood? Let me take a look. Ok, give it a try. Whoa, whoa. Hold it. Can you see what’s wrong? Yeah. Give her another try. I don't know. I mean, she's got plenty of spark, so it's not your battery. You got towing? No, I don't. Well, I do. How about we give them a call? Ok, great. Thanks. We'll be waiting. Ok, they're on their way. I really appreciate this. It's my pleasure. Do you... Do you own a boat? A sailboat. Oh, a canvas man. You sail? My father.42-foot woodcraft. Whoa, classic rail. Is he docked down in the Marina? No, no. He lives in New Orleans. Is that where you're from? Yeah. I came out hereafter grad school. And? Just haven't found a reason to go back. That's good. Why is that good? Because... We just met. You know what I mean. Hey, Jack, this is my friend Ezra. What's up? Soaking up the day. How about you? I'm soaking, baby. This must be Jack the boxer. Oh, no, no, I'm just learning. Sara's the one with the killer right cross. Jack, this is Kate, my partner nice to meet you. Hi. So what do you say? I can't. I can't. I can't. You can't what? What are you guys talking about? Well, he lives on a sailboat down in the Marina. Oh, man, that's got to bea bitchin' way to live. Yeah, nothing like the water to rock you to sleep every night. Maybe if you're a fish. So what do you say? I would love to, but I got to pick up my car... No, no. Sunset's going to be awesome. Dude... I can pick up your car for you. Thanks, Ezra, but we have some orders we have to fill. Yeah, Kate's right. I can finish your orders in, like, a blink. Go for it, man. Go sailing. I'm not hearing an excuse. Are you sure it's ok? Yeah, it's fine. Go. Have a great time. Ok, let me get my stuff. No, you don't need anything. I have a picnic. I got everything. Take my car. You're ok with this? What? It's only been a couple of months. She's going sailing, Katie. She's not getting married. It's Kate. Is this one ok? It's a good choice. Mystic, Connecticut? Yeah. I had a shoot there last year. Photographer. So, what kind of things do you shoot? Well, that depends on the client. Here, take the wheel. I'm gonna show you my last job. You trust me with this thing? Yeah, you're a natural. Ok! Heh. Here. What do you think? Wow, this is great. Yeah? What's that red line? Oh, that's a car. To catch the lightning I left the shutter wide open. The car came by. I was so pissed. I thought the shot was ruined, but... It turned out to Bethe best shot I got. You're the real thing. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. I thought maybe you were just a brat whose parents bought you a boat. Oh. Sorry to disappoint you, but I bought this boat. And for my parents... Just say we don’t spend Sunday dinners together, if you know what I mean. Come here. I wanna show you something. Wait, who's gonna steer the boat? It's autopilot, Sara. It's been on autopilot this whole time? Yeah, you're a natural. Yeah, right. Here. Lay down. What are we doing? It's one of my favorite spots on the boat. Just lying here thinking about stuff. So, you're not close with your family? When I graduated from college, my father had my whole life planned out. It was work for the family business, and then one day, if I play my cards right, mind you, I could take over and be the boss. What was the business? Accounting. eww! It's not my idea of a romantic way of spending the rest of my life. I mean, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't mind settling down someday with the right woman, have some kids. But I'm young. There's plenty of time for that. You travel a lot. You travel alone? What? Do you always grill your dates like this? I'm not grilling you. I'm just... You never know who you're gonna meet in L.A. Mmm. Well, I'm just trying to get a read on you. I'm not sure if that's what you were really asking. Well, that was the question. Yeah, but you’re trying to find out if I have a girlfriend or if... I didn't say that. Oh. Ha ha. So the question hasn’t crossed your mind? I didn't say that. And you’re not curious? Didn't say that either. Do you have a girlfriend? I was engaged once, but it didn’t work out. How about you? You ever come close? I came close once. Yeah? what happened? Wait. Come on! You've been grilling me for the last 5 minutes. I think I'm entitled to know a little something about you. What happened? He was killed. Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't... It's ok. Right here? Mm-hmm. Ok. Great. Oh... i got it. Thanks. Ha ha. Wow, you're quite the gentleman. Oh, god. Your sweatshirt. I... Yeah, you know what, um... Why don't you keep it? For next time. Next time. Well, good night. Good night. Good night. Good night.

I know you're there. Fuck! Shit! So, what is this place that you’re taking me to? Oh, it's a great place. It overlooks the water. Yeah? What kind of food is it? Someone's on my boat. Wait! Jack! Jack. Oh, shit! Jasper, Jesus. It's only you. You Jack Osborn? FBI? What are you doing on my boat? What's going on? Your mechanic here let us take a look around. Jack, I thought you might wanna cooperate. Cooperate with what? Rape of a 16-year-old girl. Uh, you mind telling us what you do for a living, Jack? No, not until you tell me what the hell's going on. You a photographer? Yeah. So what? What do you take pictures of? You have a warrant? Answer the question. What do you take pictures of? Depends on the client. Any of these clients pay you to take pictures of little girls? Naked little girls? What? No! Well, then you won't mind if I take a look in here, then, will you? Yes, I would. Why's that, Jack? You got something to hide? You got film in here? It's a camera. Hey! Wh... Hey, come on, Jack. We can get a warrant, tear your boat apart, or you can cooperate. It's up to you. You'll get your film back if we don't find anything. Yeah, which you won't. This is bullshit. No, Jack. You wanna know what's bullshit? Let me tell you what's bullshit. Some guy promised her $1,000 to take pictures without her clothes on. He didn't pay. He raped her, Jack. She's 16. That's bullshit. Oh, and you think it was me? You're a photographer, aren't you, Jack? Oh, and that means I rape little girls? Gimme a break. Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. What? You wear any jewelry? What does that have to do with anything? Forensics pulled a ring indentation off that poor girl's face. Looks like one of them initial rings. You got one of those, Jack? You got an initial ring? Look, I don't wear jewelry, and I don't have an initial ring. Look, I've had enough of this shit. You want anything else, get a fucking warrant! You know, I'll bet you really impress the girls with that mouth of yours, huh, Jack? Fuck you. We'll be in touch. Got yourself a real winner there, ma'am. What is this? You're going to love this. It's called bodekins. Go on, try it. What's wrong? What's wrong. What's wrong? There were FBI agents here, Jack. Accusing you of rape. We go to dinner. You don't even talk about it. And now you’re pouring me a beer? Hey, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm overreacting. What do you want me to do, Sara? I don't know. Be a little upset.Something. I didn't do anything wrong! Look, look. Do you... Do you actually think that I am capable of doing something like that... Of raping a little girl, of raping anyone? No. All right then. Look. Look, I don't want this to ruin our night. I've been looking forward to this day for a whole week. What's this? Don't tell me you forgot? Oh, god. Today is the seventh. I did. I'm sorry. I forgot. 2 months and you forgot? You know, I haven't been feeling well lately. I've been getting my headaches again. Again? I used to get these really bad headaches in school. What, you mean like a migraine? No, more like a hangover. Think it could be stress? Maybe. Well, maybe this will make you feel better. Ok. Open, open, open. Ah... Shoes. Not just any shoes. They’re boating shoes. I don't want you slipping all over the deck. Oh, yeah? Well, maybe I wanted to slip all over the deck. Maybe so you'd catch me. What's wrong? You'll think it’s stupid. No, I won't. Normally, i would... I just don’t want us to rush into that right now. I mean, I know it's weird for a guy to say, but I just... Just care for you so... Too much. You're right. It's weird... But it's nice. So, maybe we can spend tonight together without... You know, just... Cuddle? Ok. We'll do that. You know, why don't you try those shoes on, see if they fit. I've gotta hit the head. Hey. Sure you're ok? Yeah, couldn't be better. I didn't hear you come in last night. Oh, well, i decided to, uh, take a drive up the coast. You know, a little road trip for the soul. So, tell me. How did it go last night? Not good. What happened? We got to the boat... The FBI was there. Oh, you're kidding. What? They were searching his boat. Evidently they're investigating the rape of a 16-year-old girl, and there were these pictures and I have no idea how Jack could possibly be a suspect, but it was weird, you know. Like, they... They took his film, and... It was just... It was really weird. Sara, you know, you’ve only known this guy for a couple of months. Do you think maybe he could have some involvement? I mean, really. No, no, no. Definitely no. No. No way. You're sure? Yes. Yeah. Well, aside from all that, how did it go last night? We cuddled. You cuddled? We cuddled. So, you didn't... No, we didn't. What? Mm-hmm. He wants to wait. I think it's sweet. When did you get a beeper? Couple of weeks ago. I don't want to miss any more calls from my accountant. You know, since the machine's been acting up. Right. Been missing all our calls. Hi. Yeah, it's me. Oh, well, gee, I don't think it should be a problem. Hang on. Do you think it would be all right if I went and met her for coffee for a little while? Yeah, go. I mean, it's really slow. I have, like, 2 orders. That's it. Great. Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Ok, um... I just have to run home for a minute. It'll be about an hour. See you then. I appreciate it. You're sure you'll be all right? Yeah! Yeah, I'm great. Go! I'll talk to you later. Ok. Hey, e. What's up? Chillin', you know. Catch you guys later. Hi, you. Hey. Oh, wait. I'm caught. What's up? Hang on, hang on, hang on. All right. I got it, I got it. Dude, where did you get this? Katie bought it for me. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah, it's beautiful. I was fucking gonna buy it for you. What are you talking about? She saw me looking at it on Montana. Well, why would she do something like that? Why don't we ask her? Where was she going? She was gonna go to the house and then she was meeting her accountant. Ezra, you’re acting weird. She's the one who's acting weird. Look, I know she's your friend, but I'm getting kind of... I'm getting kind of sick of her shit, ok? You know, she erases my messages, she tells me you're not home when you are. You know, I catch her pervin' on herself in the backyard. I'm tellin' you, the chick is whack. What do you mean "pervin'"? I mean goin' off on herself. And then she fucking comes down to Montana when I'm looking at this necklace and tells me she’s sorry. How did she know where you were gonna be? Are you saying that she's following you? She didn't have to. I left a message on your machine. Then my deal with bike wells falls through. And that's her fault. Well, I find it fucking strange that the CEO gets, like, this angry phone call from some woman threatening a lawsuit if they go into production. You know, she said I stole her idea. Fuck her! Ok, because you catch her... In the backyard, you assume that she's the woman? You two were the only women who knew about my idea. Well, what about Shelly? Why is my girlfriend gonna fuck me? Why is Kate? Look, if you would have listened to your brother and patented your idea in the first place, you wouldn't be having this problem. Well, I guess it’s a fucking shame he’s not around to say I told you so, isn't it? I'm outta here. Ezra, wait. Hey, buddy, you need some help? Yeah. If you wouldn't mind swinging that door shut for me, that would be great. No problem, man. Great. Thank you. Yeah. The meeting is at 2:00. I suggest you be there. Oh, fuck. Ok. Uh, yeah. Yeah, uh-huh. We look forward to it. Thanks. Ha ha ha! What's up? This woman Cheryl Finn... She's a huge wedding planner in Malibu, ok? She just called and asked us to help her do her next 3 weddings. Oh. Oh? Oh, Katie, this is huge! I mean, this means, like, exposure and contacts and... Sara, uh... There's something that I really have to tell you, and I don't know how. I saw Jack this morning. Oh, where did you see him? Well, my meeting with Evelyn was at the Marina cafe, and I saw him with a girl. A very, very young girl. I don't think the FBI investigates people just for the fun of it. Sara, she was the daughter of a client. That's it. She wanted to take her senior picture on the boat. I can show you the film if you want. Look, I think you know I wouldn't do something like that, right? I mean, what do you want me to say? Why does everything have to be so complicated? You trust me on this, right? Hey, baby! What took you so long? Sara... No, no, Sara! Sara, it's not what you think! What am I supposed to think? You... Where is she, huh? Don't you fucking touch me! What's she paying you, how much is she paying you? Fuck you. Why don’t you tell me what the fuck is going on here, Kate. What was the money for? Yeah, I saw the whole fucking thing with Jack. What's that shit about? Hey, Kate. Is everything all right? Everything's fine, Zoey. It's all good. You have no messages. Asshole! Kate, what are you doing?! You can't stop! You can not stop! Come on! You have to go. You have to go! Would you please shut the fuck up? I need to think! No! You shut the fuck up! You just shot that guy in broad, fucking daylight, Kate. Now, come on, put the car in gear and let's go! Kate, we have to go! People saw us, Kate! They're probably fucking calling the cops right now! We have to go! Are you listening to me? The boat. The boat! Kate, no! No, you cannot go back there, Kate! What, are you fucking crazy? Kate! I wanna go home! I can't do this anymore. Oh, my... I can't... Come on! Stop it! Now, you just sit there and you be quiet. Surveillance photos. And there's probably one of me and you. What are you doing here? Sara, we gotta get out of here. I'm not going anywhere with you. No, Sara. Sara. Ezra's dead. She shot him. I saw his body. He's dead. At the Marina, right after you left. Look, Sara, we gotta get outta here. Come on! No. No, Sara, what are you doing? I'm calling the police. No! You can't! Why not? Because I'm involved! How are you involved, jack, huh? How are you involved? Is this what you’re about, huh? Is this you? Is this who you are? Would you just let me explain? Oh, god! This is you, this was you. No, no, no. No, Sara, it's... She blackmailed me. So, you raped her? No, I didn't touch her! She's lying here naked, Jack! She's naked, you're naked. She's a 16-year-old girl! Kate blackmailed me, not the girl. What? A couple weeks before you and I met, I met Kate, and she came onto me in a bar in the Marina, and she... She wanted to see my boat. I... i don't know what happened. She... she tricked me, she slipped something into my drink, and I woke up the next morning and these were on my pillow. Why? You. Sara, you. This whole thing is about you. She wants you. She's obsessed with you. And if I didn’t do what she asked... Which was? I was supposed to seduce you. I was supposed to get you to fall in love with me and then dump you. And if I didn't, she'd have the girl tell the FBI raped her. Did you? No! No. The little girl, Kate paid her to say that. All right, then who was the girl on the boat this afternoon? I don't know. Obviously, someone who works for Kate. I don't know. And she is obsessed with you, and she'll stop at nothing. Look, I tried... I tried to buy her off this afternoon. I gave her all the money I had. Sara, I... I love you. I know you don't want to hear that right now, but I do. Something I can help you with? Come on, girl. Come on, girl. Come on. All right, so we're gonna go to the boat first, then the FBI, right? Right. Keys, keys. You go on ahead. Sara. I love you. I'll meet you there. Hi. Hi. Going somewhere? No. Um... Yeah, I'm gonna, uh... I-i-I'm gonna go away. Uh, alone. I just need to, you know, spend some time... With Jack. I'm not stupid, Sara. I know what's going on. Aah! You’re not leaving me! Get off of me! You know that I love you! No! Sara, no! Don't! You're so fucking selfish! Why are you doing this to me? Haven't you figured it out by now? Hmm? Stop moving! We've been fucking since college. Twice a week sometimes. No. Oh, yes. Yeah. Remember those little dreams you used to have? Those sexual dreams? I was in them, wasn't I, baby? Wasn't I? Oh, and those headaches that you get. It's so amazing that you'd only get them in the morning, huh? Sort of like a... A hangover, or... Maybe like you were being drugged, huh? You know, the ones that I used in college, they weren’t very good, you know. They were too powerful. They were. You would be out and you'd be useless. But the new ones, oh, yeah. You just gotta love the date-rape drug, huh? Oh, yes. Baby? I still haven’t figured out what to do about the headaches. I'm sorry. It's just those damn side effects. Oh, you like this? You do, don't you? Oh, you like this. Baby, that's right. That's right. I'll take you wherever you wanna go. Oh, that's my girl. Oh, god, don't you love it? I can make you feel better than any man could ever make you feel. When are you... When are you just gonna realize that, huh? Oh, yeah. You like that, huh? Huh, my love? Now, doesn't that make you feel good? Aah! Ow! Aah! Sara. I can't believe you shot me in the foot. What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? I've got your gun. I've got your files. I've got you. I've got Jack. No, you don't. He has the pictures of the little girl. It's too fucking bad he's not gonna get a chance to use them. What are you talking about? What did you do? Tell me. Tell me! Tell me! Right about now, Jack is, uh... He's smelling gas because I punched a few holes in the fuel line, and then I, um... I disconnected a few of the wires from the blower... Ow. Fuck, Sara! Ohh! So, when he smells the gas, he goes for the blower switch, and boom! It's bye-bye. He's not gonna answer the phone. I cut the wires. Give me a little fucking credit. Oh, Sara, please don't pout. We still have each other, right? How about a little t-ooooo-ast? Time. No! Sara? Sara. Oh, god. I thought you were on the boat!
