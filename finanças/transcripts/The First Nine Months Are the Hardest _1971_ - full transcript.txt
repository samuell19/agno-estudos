I have the pleasant duty of being your guide for this evening's entertainment about pregnancy. You know, in order to be here, I had to fly from my home in Arizona. It took me about an hour. You know, 50 years ago, it would have taken a week to get here. It's a remarkable era. Not only has technology made travel faster, it's made working faster, playing faster. One thing, however, has remained just exactly the same since man started reproducing himself countless years ago. When it comes to havin' a baby, the first nine months are the hardest. (audience laughing) Oh, in addition to my duties as a guide, I also play a part tonight, which is nice since on my passport, it says Dick Van Dyke, actor. And the part I play is Dr. Richard Van Dyke, obstetrician, which is also nice since my mother always wanted me to be one. (audience laughing) Now, on the other side of that door is my waiting room, and right now, it is full of, well, ladies in waiting, and I never let them see me until I'm fully suited up, so why don't you just go in there and wait with the ladies? (warm music) - [Michele Voiceover] Is she lucky! She knows she's pregnant. Boy, does she know! (audience laughing) I sure wish I knew. - [Jackie Voiceover] I wonder what month she's in. Looks like the 12th. (audience laughing) - Hey, look at this. It takes 197,100 minutes-- - [Jackie and Cher] Or 3,200,085 hours. - [Jackie, Cher, And Michele] Or 273 and three-quarter days. - Or 39 weeks. ♪ Or nine glorious months ♪ ♪ Of ♪ - Waiting. - [Jackie, Cher, and Michele] Waiting? - Waiting. - [Jackie, Cher, and Michele] No. ♪ It's infant, infanticipating ♪ ♪ Loving every minute of maternity ♪ ♪ Oh, the time is gonna fly ♪ - Like an eternity. ♪ Gossip ♪ - Oh, you think so? ♪ Rumors ♪ - Oh, you'll see. ♪ Mustn't lose your sense of humor ♪ ♪ We know our enthusiasm won't go limp ♪ ♪ We're so happy that we're floating ♪ ♪ Like the Goodyear blimp ♪ ♪ Sittin' in the office readin' baby care ♪ ♪ Is like watching comin' attractions ♪ ♪ While you're waiting there ♪ ♪ Magazines from Harper's to Harper's Bazaar ♪ ♪ But nobody looks as bizarre as we are ♪ ♪ Minutes ♪ ♪ Hours ♪ ♪ Filled with happy thoughts of baby showers ♪ ♪ We refuse to bring a single trace of gloom ♪ ♪ To the ladies in waiting in the waiting room ♪ - Mrs. Berry, Mrs. Bono, Mrs. Farentino: ♪ You're pregnant ♪ - Oh! ♪ Here we go ♪ ♪ Here we grow ♪ ♪ Heads up, shoulders back, look out below ♪ ♪ If you really wanna see the female figure in bloom ♪ ♪ Full bloom ♪ ♪ Get a load of those ladies ♪ ♪ The ladies in waitin' ♪ ♪ Waitin', waitin', waitin' in the waiting room ♪ (audience applauding) - It's kinda nice to see them so happy. (chuckles) Oh, this is my obstetrician outfit, and of the close to five million births last year, most were accomplished with the aid of an obstetrician, most of the rest by general practitioners, and the remaining small percentage by an assortment of policemen and firemen and next-door-neighbors, and cab drivers, bartenders, New York City cab drivers, mostly. Really, that always amazes me. Even if the mother lives in Los Angeles, the paper always says a kindly, alert New York City cab driver. (audience laughing) However, because of my careful planning and preparation, that will not happen to any one of our young ladies here. What will happen to them, and to their husbands, between now and delivery time? Well, let's see. (Jackie laughing) (cork popping) (Ken grunts) (Ken and Jackie laughing) - Do you realize that you are drinking with a pregnant lady? (Ken and Jackie laughing) - And you're drinking with a pregnant man? (Ken and Jackie laughing) (audience laughing) - Oh, silly! You're silly! - A little more wine, Mother? - Thank you, Father. Father. (Ken laughs) - Well, (Jackie giggles) here's to you-know-who. - Aw! - Aw. - Aw. (audience laughing) - Ah, it's still due August the 24th, huh? - That's what he said. - Hey, you know whose birthday that is? - No, whose? - Little old what's-his-name. (Ken and Jackie laughing) (audience laughing) - Or what's-her-name. - Oh, yeah! - Oh, no, I'm so silly too! (Ken and Jackie laughing) (audience laughing) - Oh, gosh. August the 24th, huh? - Uh-huh. - You know, I always wondered, how do you know that? - Oh, well, Dr. Van Dyke told me, he figured it out. I think that August is just the perfect time. - How? - How what? - How did he figure it out? - Oh, well, you know, by the things that I told him. (audience laughing) - What did you tell him? (audience laughing) - Well, the information from my calendar. - Your calendar? Oh, you mean you tell him that Arbor Day falls on a Thursday, and he tells you what day you're gonna have a baby? - No, my personal calendar. - I didn't know you had one. - Oh, it's no big secret. You know, it's right there. - Where? - In the shoebox, (audience laughing) the bottom of my closet, under my cheerleading sweater. (audience laughing) - I don't know how I missed it. (audience laughing) Jackie? - Yeah? - What things are on that calendar? - Everything. - What kind of everything? - Well, just the everything about us. - You mean that you write down everything we say and do on that calendar? - Mostly do. - You don't! (audience laughing) - I do, and one thing that we did was go to a costume party last November. Remember, you Tarzan, me Jane? (audience laughing) - Oh, yeah, (laughs) oh, yeah. That was some party, wasn't it? - Whoa-ho-ho! (Ken laughs) - You sure looked good in that leopard skin. (laughs) "Catch me, catch me!" - Oh! (audience laughing) - (laughs) Yeah, me Tarzan, you Jane, all right. - And I think that was, mm-hmm. - Oh, it was? - Uh-huh. (Ken laughs) - And also, if there's any problem, you know, if we wanna name it, if it's a boy, we know what to name it. - What? - Boy! (Ken and Jackie laughing) (audience laughing) - Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Honey-- - What? - You're perfect. - Honey, you're perfect too. - Aw. August 25th, right? - Mm, that's what he said. - Hey, I just thought of something. - What? - You know, if you hold out for another week, we could have the baby on Labor Day! - What are you talking about? - Well, don't you get it? Labor Day! (Michele groans) (audience laughing) - Honey, you're silly! - And you are the greatest woman in the whole world. - Oh, honey. - No, because of you, we're gonna be a family, not just you and me anymore, which was great, but a family. I mean, that's the one thing I wanted more than anything else in my whole life. - Oh, honey, I'm so glad it makes you happy. - Hey, the doctor did say everything's okay, didn't he? - Oh, yes, honey, I'm perfect. - Oh, that's good. - Oh, honey, by the way, we discussed his fee. - Oh, yeah? - He thought that $500 would be fair. - For what? (audience laughing) - For everything! - Honey, $500? - Well, honey, we're getting a big break. He gets up to $1,500 for some babies. - What does he do, charge by the pound? (audience laughing) - Jimmy, don't forget, the $500 includes postnatal care, prenatal care, and the delivery. - Is there any way we could pick it up ourselves? (audience laughing) - Jimmy, honey, won't the insurance cover most the costs? - Michele, sweetheart, no! The maternity benefits are very small! Honey, $500? $500, and we did all the work. (audience laughing) Wait a second! I got it! - What? - We don't tell anybody you're pregnant! Then, on August 25th, you fake an appendicitis attack, (audience laughing) we take you to the hospital, and when they take out your appendix, they're certainly not gonna leave the kid there. (audience laughing and applauding) - Yeah, okay, Joe, don't worry about it. Sure, I'll take care of everything, mm-hmm. Hey, Joe, you wanna hear some great news? Cher and I are going to, uh, Cher and I, we're, Cher and I are gonna paint the garage. (audience laughing) Well, I just thought you'd be interested. (audience laughing) Why couldn't I tell him? - You can't tell anybody, not until I show. - Why not? - Well, I don't know, it's a superstition. - What superstition? - Well, they say if you tell anybody you're pregnant before your third month, you get rats in your cellar. (audience laughing) - Cher, we don't have a cellar. - Yeah, so who needs 'em in the house? (audience laughing) Anyway, honey, isn't it enough that you and I know? - Yeah, but a fella gets proud, you know? I got it, I'll tell everybody I'm gonna be a father, but I won't tell 'em it's you. (audience laughing) (telephone ringing) - Now, not a word, not a word. - Hello. Oh, hello, Mr. Carter! Can I at least tell him? - No, Sonny. - Cher, he's your father. (audience laughing) (speaking drowned out by audience laughing) Remember? - Oh, okay. - Hello. Yeah, golf Sunday, sure, mm-hmm. Listen, I've got some news. (laughs) Cher, um, yeah, we're expecting a little stranger. (laughs) He said to bring him along. (audience laughing) - Honey, just tell him! - Let me put it to you this way, what do you want to be called, Grandpa or Gramps? That's right, Cher's gonna have a baby! Five phases pregnant! What are you counting for? We've been married for two years. (audience laughing) (energetic music) (audience applauding) - [Announcer] Claudia Noble had a dream. She dreamed of teaching children to dance. Claudia Noble had a dream, but very little money, so she got some space, filled it with little girls, and heated it with gas. Gas helped a dream come true. - Now, you are spring flowers, and the wind is blowing. Sway with the wind, stretch, run! ("Waltz of the Flowers") - [Announcer] Claudia still had very little money, but she didn't need much. She heated with gas. Gas heat let her spring flowers blossom all winter long. Gas heat kept those flowers fresh and comfortable and clean. Gas saved Claudia lots of money that winter, and every winter, so her garden grew and grew, and grew. - Now, stretch up, up, flowers should kiss the sun! ("Waltz of the Flowers") - [Announcer] Claudia had one other dream, and it came true as well. She found her love, they built a house, and yes, remembered gas. Gas made their winters cozy, gas kept their cottage clean, gas kept their bills way down. So if you have a dream, remember gas. It gives you a better deal. It even helps a dream come true. ♪ Oh, put on the bacon, put on the eggs ♪ ♪ Spread that jelly all over the place ♪ ♪ Papa gonna put on the feedbag ♪ (audience laughing) - Oh, what's for breakfast, my dear, hmm? - Oh, Ken, don't do that! - Huh? - You're rocking the kitchen. (audience laughing) - What? - Honey, would you do me a favor and go eat at the drug store? - Oh, no, honey, are you sick again? - Yeah, and I'm going back to bed. - No, no, no, Jackie, no, no, no, look. I am sure that this is just a case of mind over matter. Now, come on, let's talk this out. What makes you nauseous? - This conversation. - No, no. (audience laughing) I'm gonna try something. Now, I'm gonna mention a whole lotta different foods-- - Oh, please don't! (audience laughing) Besides, it isn't only food-- - Ah-ha, ah-ha, now we're gettin' some place. Okay, what else makes you sick? - You. (audience laughing) - Will you be serious? I'm trying to help you. - I am serious! Kenny, you make me nauseous. (audience laughing) - Me, your own husband makes you nauseous? - Well, not you, it's your smell. (audience laughing) - I have a smell? - Oh! It's your hair tonic and your shaving lotion, and your soap and your talcum powder. (groans) - Huh, guess the honeymoon's over, huh? - Aw, don't be silly! I still love you. You just make me sick to my stomach. (audience laughing) - What, you want me to move out, huh? - Oh, please! Listen, it only lasts a couple of weeks, and besides, as soon as you go, I open the windows, and I feel a lot better. (audience laughing) - Wonderful, wonderful. - Oh, Kenny, don't be upset. - Oh, why should I be upset? You just made me feel like a swamp. (audience laughing) - Ken, you know, I think you're right, and it is psychological. In fact, just talking about it like this, I really feel a lot better. You know, my mind is takin' over the matter. (audience laughing) - You really mean it? - Yeah, look, I feel a lot better, see? - (laughs) Oh, good, honey, great. You really had me worried there for a minute, you know? (laughs) Oh, look, sweetheart, it's gettin' late anyway, so why don't you just forget about makin' breakfast, and I'll run over and I'll have a bite at the drug store, okay? Hug and a kiss? - Hug and a kiss. - (laughs) That's my girl. (audience laughing) Bye, honey. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - Don't worry, my dear. No, practically everyone goes through it. Well, I doubt that anyone's ever died from it. It should disappear about the middle of the third month. No, I promise. Because about the middle of the third month, another interesting biological change takes place in the female body. About the 14th or the 15th week, the prospective mother is overcome with an irresistible urge to shop. (audience laughing) (audience laughing) - Oh, honey, how do you like this one? - How much is it? - You know, I think yellow is beautiful because it'll go with either a boy or a girl. - I don't think it's as nice. - As which one? - As your sister's. - Sonny, are you gonna start that again? I told you, I will not have my first baby in a used crib. - Cher, they didn't use it to store garbage. (audience laughing) Your own nephew slept in it, that's all he did. Well, all right, we'll get a new mattress. - Sonny, the railings are all chewed off. - There's enough left for him to sleep in, don't worry. (audience laughing) - You do not feel about this baby as I do. - You're right, Cher. I know I'm the father, you think John Paul Getty is. (audience laughing) - Sonny, we've hardly bought anything! - Just today, okay? Just today. We bought the monkey lamp. - 7.98. - The giraffe clothes rack. - That wasn't expensive. - The kangaroo chair. - Yeah? - And the hippopotamus dress. - What hippopotamus dress? - That dress you bought, it makes you look like a hippopotamus. (audience laughing) - That settles it. I'm gonna go home to my mother's. I'll have the baby there, I'll raise him, and when he's old enough to play catch, then I'll bring him home for you. (audience laughing) - Come on, Cher, you know I want this child as much as you do, more! I'm ready to take him strip! (audience laughing) - You know what you're doing, don't you, all this yelling and screaming? You're creating a neurotic child. There's a lot to be said for prenatal influence. Right now, he knows that his father does not wanna buy him a new crib! (audience laughing) - Only because his dear father blew all his money redecorating the nursery, and getting the most expensive doctor for his mother! (audience laughing) So expensive that his father has to eat a lousy baloney sandwich every day for lunch! (audience laughing) - I'm sorry, honey, I guess I am unreasonable. - No, you're reasonable. - Well, let's not fight, okay? - Okay, I'm sorry! - Well, what are you yelling for? - I want him to know. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - No, I'm sure it's all right, my dear. No, it's just a theory. If you want to watch Godzilla, go right ahead. (audience laughing) I assure you that it won't affect your baby. Goodnight. (groans) Now, you may think that's crazy, waking a guy up at three in the morning to ask if you can watch a horror movie. You're right, it's crazy, (audience laughing) but it's all part of the condition. One time, one of my patients called me up, she was watching the political conventions, and she was afraid that her baby would grow up to be a liar. (audience laughing) But that's what all expectant mothers think about, their families. And about the fifth month, the lady stops being a wife, and starts worrying about the security of her family. (audience laughing) - 16, (breathes deeply) 17, (breathes deeply) 18, (breathes deeply) 19. - What are you doing, Michele? - Practicing breath control. - (laughs) Isn't it a little late for that? (audience laughing) - I said breath control. (audience laughing) It makes it easier for the doctor during delivery. - Oh, yeah, how? - I don't know. But I think when you're doing this, you're too busy to scream. - For $500, you can scream. (audience laughing) - Oh, boy! Honey? - Mm-hmm? - My cousin Fred call you about insurance? - Yeah. - Well? - I've got insurance, $50 deductible, fire and theft. (audience laughing) - I'm not talking about the car. - Neither am I. We've got a very unusual policy. We collect a fortune if anyone hits me, robs me, or sets me on fire. (audience laughing) - Jimmy, for a man with a family, life insurance is very important! - Only if you die! (audience laughing) Michele, I am young, I'm healthy, semi-attractive, and I don't wanna talk about it. - I don't wanna talk about it either, honey, but it is conceivable that you could go to sleep tonight and not wake up tomorrow morning. (audience laughing) Now, where would that leave me? - Next to a very cold person. (audience laughing and clapping) I don't want to talk about it. - Fred said you could get hit by a car on your way to work tomorrow, or a safe could fall on your head, or a crazy person could come running out of a doorway with an icepick and stab you in the side. Who knows, you could even fall down an elevator shaft. (audience laughing) - You and Fred have quite a day planned for me! (audience laughing) Listen, why don't I just take the guesswork out of it and shoot myself? - Oh, Jimmy, don't be silly. Fred said we couldn't collect on a suicide. (audience laughing) - You mean you discussed the possibility? - Jimmy, with children, you must make provisions in case you're not here! - But Michele, I'm not going anywhere! We've got a three-year lease with no sublet clause. (audience laughing) - Jim, look at it this way. Some policies are like an investment. When the policy expires, you get your money back with interest. Now, for a man your age, that's no risk at all. And in case anything happens, your family is protected along the way. (audience laughing) - And now, back to David Brinkley and the news. (audience laughing and clapping) - All right, all right. We'll manage somehow. - Oh, come on, honey. Look, I know you're right, but, well, it's kinda hard for a guy to accept the fact that he's gonna be the first of his loved ones to die! (audience laughing) I'll call Fred, I promise. - Oh, thank you, honey, thank you. Say, why don't we go out tonight? - Sure, let's live it up, I don't have much time. (audience laughing) Okay, how 'bout a movie? - No, I've got a better idea. Why don't we go over to Bob and Jane? She's got some maternity clothes I want to borrow. - [James] Fine! - And while you're there, you can talk to Bob about a will. (audience laughing) - Hey, honey? - Huh? - I got a better idea. Why don't I call Bob and Jane and you call Fred, and we'll tell 'em all to meet us at the cemetery. (audience laughing) - Where you going? - To put on my black suit. (audience laughing and applauding) - Yes, yes, no, I've heard the superstition before, and frankly, I wouldn't count on that. Well, with no disrespect to your maid, it has never been scientifically proven that carrying high means a girl. I personally was carried very high myself and my baby sister was carried very low, as I recall. I used to bump my head on my own mother. (audience laughing) Sorry.

There isn't much that can go wrong with dependable gas equipment, just things to know so you get the best performance. The gas dryer. Don't overload it. After every load, clean out the lint filter. It'll help you get the most out of your gas dryer. In most areas, five loads for the price of one in any other dryer. Then there's the gas range. Hey, notice that steady blue flame? If it burns yellow, it could mean your burners are clogged. Now, it's easy to lift them out and wash them. If that doesn't do the trick, call a service man and have them adjusted. And I hope you're lucky enough to have one of the new gas ovens that clean themselves. Now, the furnace is easy too. Here's how you get ready for the winter. Just call your dealer or heating contractor. He'll lubricate the motor, check the controls, and be sure your furnace is in top working order. Now, in a warm air system, you should change the filters at least once a year. If you have gas air conditioning too, it's a good idea to change the filters more often. These are things that make your gas appliances work more efficiently. They save you money and save our country's energy supplies. And remember, any time you need us, your gas company is as close as your telephone. The gas people don't forget you after the sale is made. - These are just some of the books which I recommend that my patients and their husbands read during their pregnancy. Now, you may think, of course, that that's an awful lot of reading, but folks, let's face it, they have a lot of time to read. I mean, she certainly can't go bowling, can she? (audience laughing) These books are very helpful. For instance, here's one which reads: Provisions should be made for the new mother to get as much help as possible in the home when she returns from the hospital. Now, this may be provided by a trained nurse or one or both of the grandmothers. It is a matter that should be decided upon well in advance and discussed thoroughly and intelligently by husband and wife. - There's no discussion. Your mother's not coming. (audience laughing) - That's because you want your mother to come. - No, I don't want either of 'em. They'd be destructive and divisive. - What does that mean? - They'd screw everything up. (audience laughing) Get a nurse. - Oh, Sonny, my mother's gonna be awfully upset if she can't come and take care of the baby. I mean, ever since I was a girl, she's been waiting for the day when I'd have a baby. - Yeah? How come they never left us alone in the living room? (audience laughing) - Oh, Sonny! - Look, Cher, it boils down to this. You want what's best for the baby, don't ya? - Yeah. - Then we gotta get a trained nurse. - Well, all right. Here's a list of the nurses that the doctor gave me. - Let's see. Mrs. Steinmetz, Mrs. Goldbranson, Mrs. Spitzer. These are good names, Cher, lotsa consonants, like German generals. (audience laughing) Who should I call first? - Well, I don't know, I guess it's just a matter of personality. They all cost about the same, $150 a week. - $150 a week? - Yeah. Which one you calling? - Your mother. (audience laughing) I don't like her, but the price is right. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - Ken! - Mm-hmm. - Kenny, get up! - Hmm, what? - Get up! - What, what, what? What's the matter? - It's kicking, it's kicking! - [Ken] What, the baby? - [Jackie] I hope so. - Oh! (audience laughing) Where, where should I look, huh? - Oh, it stopped. - Oh. The light musta scared him. (audience laughing) - You missed it, honey, but it was right here, right on the left side. - Oh, nuts! - Oh, well, maybe it was gas. - Well, can't you tell the difference between gas and a kick? - No, I've never been kicked from the inside before. (audience laughing) - Look, you stay right there. - Where you going? - I'm gonna go get the camera in case he does it again. Now, turn on that other lamp over there, and I'm gonna get the floodlights. - Honey, you can't take pictures of me like this. - It's just for the immediate family, honey. - Kenny, you are not taking pictures of me this way! It's crazy! - Oh! If Andy Warhol did it, you'd call it art. (audience laughing) - I absolutely refuse. Oh, he's doing it! - Huh? - He's doing it! - Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait! - Uh-huh! Oh! - Oh, yeah! I can see it through the sheets! (laughs) Oh, this is beautiful! (laughs) Oh, what a lens! - Oh, Kenny, Kenny! (audience laughing) - [Ken] Okay, okay, I'm comin' in for a closeup. I'm zooming!

Pay a quarter and dump her in the water. You there, with the muscle, hit the bullseye and drop the little lady in the drink. Three balls for a quarter. Look, hey, hey, look at that! A near miss. - Give me another one. - Here we go again. - [Man Wearing Glasses] This is it. (bell dings) - Hey! - Gotcha! - Don't go away, folks. We won't be long. She's gone to dry her things in a Speed Queen gas dryer, with a long-life stainless steel drum. It's the smooth drum, easy on me lady's permanent press. Nobody has it but Speed Queen. Monica! Monica! - I'm hurryin'. - There she is, and lovely too! Not a wrinkle. Sport, let the little girl try one, will ya? Hey, there you go. (bell dings) (Monica splashing) Very good. Back to the dryer, folks. - That gorgeous gown in the dryer? - A gas dryer, ma'am. Gas is very gentle, and it costs a lot less to run. Speed Queen specializes in laundry equipment, you know? Speed Queen's done it again! Okay, who's next? Men, step right up! (playful music) The more dryin' you do, the more you need a Speed Queen gas dryer. (playful music) - Well, the waiting's almost over. Our ladies are in their ninth month, and I won't see them until the hospital, which is good because a very highly respected professor of obstetrics once said avoid contact with your patients and their husbands in the ninth month, as during that period, they have a tendency to go bananas. (audience laughing) (alarm clock ringing) (Kenny groaning) - [Jackie] Get the alarm, would you? - [Ken] Yeah! - Oh, boy. Feels like we just went to sleep. What time is it? - It's a quarter to one. - We did just go to sleep. (audience laughing) Get back in bed! - Sweetheart, got to see how long it's gonna take me to drive to the hospital. - [Jackie] At one in the morning? - Well, you never know when the baby's gonna come. - Oh, Kenny, there are 24 hours in the day! - Uh-huh, that's why I'm timing them all. (audience laughing) I only have seven more to go. - You mean you've already made 17 trips? - Yeah, in clear weather. I still have to try it in rain and snow. (audience laughing) - Ken, the baby's due in August. - Oh, well, maybe we can forget the snow, but not rain. That slows you down, you know? - Oh, honey, what difference does it make? - What difference? Well, the difference between your having the baby in the hospital or in a bucket seat! (audience laughing) Now, based on my figures so far, traffic-wise, I think we should shoot for the hours between 10 p.m. and eight a.m. (audience laughing) - You know you're crazy? I'm surprised you haven't timed how long it's gonna take the doctor to go from his house. - 47 minutes. (audience laughing) - You didn't! - Yeah. Well, what's the use of our rushing if he's gonna be late? (audience laughing) I figure we have to call him 13 minutes before we leave here. - Yeah, well, he's not gonna be just sitting home waiting for our call, you know? - I know that. From his mother's house, it'll take him 15 minutes. From his sister Shirley's, 25 minutes. If he's at his club, that's right around the corner from the hospital. It's four minutes walking and two minutes trotting. - How about skipping? - I don't have an official time on that, I tripped. (audience laughing) (laughs) Go back to sleep, honey. I'll see you later. Fairview Hospital, here I come. - Oh, darling, after you get to Fairview, would you do me a favor? - Yeah, what? - Would you time how long it takes to get from there to General Hospital? 'Cause that's where I'm gonna have the baby. (audience laughing) - Good, good, I'm glad you told me that. I'll figure that in. (audience laughing and applauding) (audience laughing) - Honey? - Hmm? - Could I sit in that chair? That's the only chair I'm comfortable in. - Oh, sure, honey. (audience laughing) (Michele breathes deeply) (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - Oh, that's better! It feels good to get off my feet. Oh, honey! Are my ankles swollen? - I don't know, how do they look to you? - How would I know? I haven't seen 'em for two months. (audience laughing) Oh, honey, I feel like I've been pregnant my whole life! - Yeah. (audience laughing) - Honey? Am I fat? (audience laughing) - Compared to what? (audience laughing) - I bet if we were just going together and I looked like this, you wouldn't marry me. (audience laughing) - If you looked like that, I'd have to marry you. (audience laughing) No, honey, I'd want to marry you. - You would? - Oh, sure! Because, pussycat, as hard as it is for you to believe, I just know that some day, you're gonna look good again! (audience laughing) - Some people think I look lovely this way. - You're kidding. (audience laughing) - Richard said I looked lovely. - Richard? - Richard, my doctor! - Oh, so it's Richard now, is it? And just how long has this been going on? - Honey, all the girls call him by his first name! - Oh, they do, do they? Oh, I've heard of things like this happening, women falling in love with their obstetricians! You're in love with your doctor! - I'm not in love with my doctor! He's just a very kind, considerate, capable, gentle, handsome man. (audience laughing) Makes a fat lady feel good to be told she's attractive by that voice. (audience laughing) - Well, you happen to be my fat lady, and if anyone's gonna tell you you look good, it's me, not Richard! - Well you never tell me! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Well, I'll go on record right now! Fat lady, you're beautiful! (audience laughing) - He didn't mean it. (audience laughing) You saw him, he didn't mean it. As I said before, the only one who really cares, who really understands, in a totally professional way, of course, is my beloved doctor. (audience laughing) - The greatest man in the world, greater than all the astronauts and baseball players in the world put together, including Russia.
