(wind rustling) (soft piano fades in) I came to New York to attend NYU to study music business. Yeah, I was 16 years old, um I- I turned 17 shortly thereafter, but when I arrived in August of 2001, I was 16 years old. Of course, 9/11 happened just- I believe my second week of classes? So that colors the memories, um, of that time, but it was- it was overwhelming in general. I mean- I was on my own. Um, I- I went to go see Michael Jackson on September 10th, and I was starting classes. I was responsible for getting myself to classes every single day. (laughs) You know? It- it was definitely overwhelming, you know? I came to New York University to study music business, and part of the reason that I was so interested in music business was because, um, I'd been such a big fan of Michael Jackson, not only of his music and his dance and all that, which is incredible, but also of his business acumen so I came to NYU knowing so much about publishing, and royalty rates, and things like that because I had studied all of his business deals. You know- our first week of classes, we had this program, um, meeting that we would do which, um, they were weekly assemblies where everybody in our major would get together and discuss things that were happening in the industry, um, we would have speakers come in from, you know, various record labels or NARAS, which, you know, works with the Grammys and- and different songwriters, things like that. It was a time to come together and really assess the landscape of the music business and the very first program meeting, I was introducing myself to the group, as a whole. and I don't remember if I was running for some sort of like- representative position or if I just wanted to introduce myself for whatever reason? (laughs) But, I was wearing a Jackson's Victory Tour T-Shirt, and it was vintage. I had just bought it in the village, and a young man came up to me and told me that he liked my shirt and, ah… That young man turned out to be Jordan Chandler. (melancholic orchestra music) (orchestra strings get louder) (strings soften and fade out) I have on the phone with me investigative journalist, Charles Thomson, who is the winner of 6 national awards for his recent, um, investigative work exposing the Shoebury pedophile ring. So Charles, you've sat in on a lot of pedophile cases. What would you say are the main differences between the cases that you've sat in on and the Michael Jackson case? CHARLES: Of course, the first difference is that the cases that I've covered were all criminal cases where there was was no real financial incentive to make an allegation, so the motive of seeking millions of dollars is removed. And then in the cases where we see convictions that I’ve been sitting in, you had victims who were credible, who were consistent, and that's never been the case in the allegations against Michael Jackson. They've never been consistent. They've always turned out to be perjurers and people who were just looking for a payout. REPORTER: Michael Jackson was one of the most famous people on the planet. It turns out he was also the target of intensive FBI scrutiny. DANNY: I have also read that you have extensively studied the Michael Jackson FBI files. What were the findings of the FBI files and were child porn was ever discovered at Neverland? CHARLES: No child porn was ever found at Neverland. And in fact, there was a story that said child porn had been found around the time of the trial So the judge and the prosecutor both released a stipulation publicly which was that: No child pornography was ever found at Neverland or at any of Michael Jackson's properties. So that's not just something that the fans say. That's the judge in the trial and even the prosecutor said that there was no child porn. In terms of what the FBI files tell us, ah, what they tell us is that for over a decade, the FBI was intermittently involved in investigating Michael Jackson. There's no evidence of sustained surveillance or sustained investigation, only of the authorities occasionally calling the FBI to assist them with their own investigations, but nonetheless, the files tell us that more than 20 different FBI departments investigated Michael Jackson at one time or another, and none of them found any evidence of any wrongdoing. Perhaps the most compelling piece of information that came out of those files was that when the prosecutors in the 2003 - '05 Arvizo case sent away all of the computers that they seized at Neverland to the FBI for analysis, the FBI was unable to find anything incriminating on a single one of them. So the FBI files don't exonerate Michael Jackson, but they certainly don't incriminate him. DANNY: In 2005, there was a study done by ABC with the top psychiatrists in the country and they all concluded that Michael Jackson’s behavior would be very rare amongst pedophiles. And there are other psychologists and psychiatrists who echo that belief. (speaking German) DANNY: Someone who is always trying to dispute that notion is a man named Jim Clemente. Jim Clemente, to this day, believes that Michael Jackson does fit the profile of a pedophile and that Michael Jackson did have child porn at Neverland. CLEMENTE: They found, um, images and I think they were of a photoshoot with Michael Jackson's nephew, Taj. I think he was still a teenager. And there's a picture that's on the internet that I Um, It's a picture of Michael. You see that? FEMALE VOICE: WHAT?! OH MY…. Yes, yes. - So there are pictures in this series where’s he actually- he’s actually GRABBING their cloth and trying to RIP it off him, laughing, and joking, and trying to get him naked. And he's I mean, he's virtually naked in this picture - This is his NEPHEW... this FORTY something year old man - Yeah.. And why is he posing in a picture where Michael's shirt is open, exposing his chest and this kid's chest- I mean- He's basically naked! upper body is basically naked, he’s got no underwear on, right next to Michael Jackson. I mean, it's disgusting. My name is Taj Jackson. I'm the nephew of Michael Jackson. CROWD CHANTING: "3T! 3T! 3T! 3T! 3T" (3T- Anything) I wait for the day when I can say that girl's mine Cuz I would do anything for you, yes I would. I'll give you love (I'll give you love)... TAJ: You know, and I know it's not gonna be put to rest, but I hope that it's really put to rest because these pictures have been circulating. These pictures are annoying that they're circulating. You know, we sued one of the tabloids because they said that they were child pornography and we had them retract that, because that's not what they were. They were for an album. They were for a single cover, "Why". (Michael Jackson - Stranger in Moscow) I was wandering in the rain... TAJ: My uncle was doing the music video for "Stranger in Moscow" at the time and we came down to visit him. but also, we were “Let's take this opportunity since we're all here, Let's do the 'Why' photoshoot as well." There was wardrobe. There was a camera director. There was makeup. We wanted to do something edgy for our "Why" photoshoot. We wanted the guys and the girls and we and we thought we were "too cute" [laughs] You know a 3T like too "saccharine" and we wanted to have some “edge” some- you know? Something to us. (3T - Why) It's not like I can't escape what's in my soul. TAJ: It's frustrating because this is what they do all the time in this way. Luckily I was involved in it, you know? This was my younger brother, TJ. If he was here, he'd be even probably more upset than I am right now. Like it's implied that TJ was clueless or TJ didn't know what was going on. TJ was very aware of what was going on. TJ wanted him to go farther! I was uncomfortable taking off my shirt, and so I did have to take off my shirt. It was never like he said, "No, you take off your shirt and you do this and that." It was whatever we wanted to do because we wanted to be edgy. And it worked because people are talking about it! Now, unfortunately, they're trying to dirty it, but it was edgy. He mentioned that you know, Michael's laughing in that- because we were joking! We, you know, for us, we wanted to do something edgy! But we always laughed when we were around my uncle and he laughed when he was around us, and so that should tell you something: that there was no tension. You're not seeing our faces like "We don't want to do this" or whatever because we were pushing him to do this. It really- it makes me feel angry to be honest, um, just because That photo shoot was a great memory for me and to hear someone try and dirty it up in that way? The way they're trying to twist it as if my uncle came and said, "Hey, I'm just gonna start ripping off clothes." That's farthest from the truth. There was plenty of people there, you know, that witnessed everything that would back up you know- my story or my uncle's story if he was alive. But at the same time this guy who basically is just guessing what happened at the photo shoot by pictures. What gets me upset is just people- outside people judging my uncle without knowing the scenario. One thing I do want to say is you know, people like that that just, you know, on the outside, And he's supposed to be a professional? And you hear him. He sounds giddy, you know? He sounds like someone that is just spiteful and hateful and it's those kind of people like- they need something in their life. They really do, you know? Leave our family alone. (daunting music) AKON: You never done things that was missing in your life? You just go back to do it, and Mike just like to just have great fun and the stuff he liked to do, adults don't like doing that. SCANLAN: I think he had more fun hanging out with just everyday people that he didn't even know who they were, you know? Either they were local people or touristsor whatever and he didn't even know who they were, you know? He'd just meet ‘em and talk to ‘em, get to know a little bit: “Hey you wanna come out to the ranch?" (whimsical music) DANNY: You were invited to Michael Jackson's Neverland before. - I mean, it was amazing. I've been there, probably 8 times. - 8 times? - Yeah! I spent the night. The first time I ever went was actually the time I spent the night. He walked us through his entire house, um, his bedroom, his memorabilia room, bathrooms, every- every place in his house. We were like, telling him how beautiful it was, and he was like, "You've never been here before?!" and my friends and I looked at each other like, "Nope, we sure haven't, like- when would we have been here?" You know? So he would invite- if there were fans sitting outside, he would, like, see us and tell Violet, who was security, to let us in and he would let us do whatever. - So that speaks volume to just how easily he trusts people to like- come into his life, even. - Yeah, I mean unfortunately, he trusted a lot of people he shouldn't have trusted in his life. - they go, "oh you slept in the same bedroom as him". It's like I don't think you understand. Michael Jackson's bedroom is 2 stories, (laughs) and it has like- like 3 bathrooms and this and that, so when I slept in his bedroom, yeah but you have to understand the whole scenario, and the thing is with Michael is that he's not very good at explaining himself, and he never really has been. - Michael Jackson, his bedroom was 2 stories so when you first walked in, I didn't realize at first it was his bedroom because his bed wasn't there on the bottom floor. but it was just, it was kind of- very cluttered with a lot of things. I like- actually sat on his bed and he was just kind of just talking about Neverland to us, and that was surreal. (laughs) (gentle music) Michael was going to Miami, so myself and a couple of friends flew in from Europe to spend some time with him. And before he had to go, he told us that we could stay and that we can enjoy Neverland as much as we wanted. While the ranch manager took us to the main house, he told me that Michael had said to give us the Royal Treatment, And we sure got the Royal Treatment. When we went up to the main house, all the staff were lined up on the stairs welcoming us, and they told us that there- we could move around as freely as we wanted to. There were no places that were off-limits. - And this was 16 years ago, so it's been a while, but I just remember like- being completely in shock the whole time. Most people are just- I can't believe that he let us in his house like that. (somber music) JOSEPHINE: Several weeks later, after we'd already come back to classes after 9/11, I was working as a work-study in the music department. So, he came in to register for private guitar lessons. He always carried his guitar with him everywhere he went and um, we had a nice conversation. He remembered me from our program meeting. We had a little chat, exchanged pleasantries, and he gave me his form, and as I went to register him for these private lessons, I saw his name for the first time, which was Jordan Chandler. and I believe he told me his first name, but I didn't know his last name at that point. And when I saw Jordan Chandler on a piece of paper, I just- I couldn't quite place it then either. Um, it just sounded very very familiar, and keep in mind, at the time , um, Jordan Chandler's name wasn't widely known because in the U.S., you know, alleged crimes of sex abuse, particularly when they're minors, are very protected. but I went online, and I 'Asked Jeeves'- dating myself- (keyboard typing sound and mouse click) and um, I suddenly realized that he was in fact the first accuser from 1993. (somber string instrument fade out) DANNY: So Evan Chandler and June Chandler, originally June Wong, had a child named Jordan Chandler who turns out to be the first alleged victim. June Chandler divorced Evan Chandler and married a man named David Schwartz. Charles, can you tell me about Evan Chandler? CHARLES: So Evan Chandler was born in New York. He was actually born Evan Charmatz, but he wanted a career as a screenwriter, so he moved to California and changed his name from Charmatz to Chandler because he thought that Charmatz was too Jewish-sounding. He became a dentist, but he didn't really enjoy it and also was not really very good at it. He was censured by the regulatory board for shoddy work. He was also accused at one point of sexually assaulting a female patient while he was working on her. He had a very kind of a brief career as a screenwriter. He got a screenwriting credit around 1993 on the film, 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights'. ("Men in Tights" plays) We're men, we're men in tights. We roam around the forest looking for fights. REPORTER: Apparently, he was working on Mel Brooks when he came up with the 'Men in Tights' idea- or he said his son came up with the 'Men in Tights' idea- this is the same 13-year-old boy, and apparently, maybe Mel was under some kind of ether or anesthetic but he decided it was a great idea and went along with the dentist and they put the movie together. I would imagine a dentist to the stars would be exposed to a lot of the glamour in Hollywood. He can see his successful customers talking on the phone making deals and it looks so easy to someone on the outside, you know? And he figured he wanted to get a little piece of the pie and get you know? Stop drilling teeth and maybe become a producer and really make some big bucks. (ominous music) CHARLES: So Michael Jackson is in Los Angeles with some of his team and they're driving along Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills and the car breaks down. There's a lady in the area who sees Michael Jackson stranded by the side of the road and calls her husband who works at a business called Rent-A-Wreck, which is a car rental business. Rent-A-Wreck is owned by Dave Schwartz. So Dave Schwartz calls his wife June because he knows that Jordan Chandler, her son, is a massive Michael Jackson fan. There was one employee at Rent-A-Wreck who said that when June arrived, she was kind of forcing Jordie on Michael Jackson, almost like trying to emotionally blackmail him. So that's how the numbers got exchanged and they ended up staying in touch. DANNY: So, a friendship develops between Michael Jackson and the Chandler family, excluding Evan Chandler. During this period, Michael Jackson would have stay-overs at their house. They would come over and sleepover at Michael Jackson’s house. Where is Evan Chandler during this period of time? CHARLES: Evan Chandler was pretty much an absent father. He owed almost $70,000 in unpaid child support. He had been rowing with June about how infrequently he was seeing his son. She was trying to get Evan to take Jordan more often and he was refusing. He had his own new family, like June did. He'd remarried and had kids with another lady, and they were struggling to get Evan to engage with Jordie. It was not until he discovered that his son was now friends with Michael Jackson that he suddenly became interested in seeing him again. FREEMAN: My recollection was that he was not very interested in Jordie, prior to the time that Jordie took up with Michael and as soon as Jordie took up with Michael, Evan became the most interested parent in the world. CHARLES: They seemed to be getting on quite well Evan even at one point asked him to build an extra wing onto the house so he could come and stay more often And then when that idea didn't work, he said, "Well, I've got a better idea. Why don't you just build me a new house?" and then that didn't happen either, June dropped the bombshell that she and Jordie were thinking of going on tour with Michael, and then Evan, who previously had been an absent father and wasn't paying his child support, and wasn't really interested in seeing his son at all, all of a sudden became enraged about the idea that Jordan would be out of the country for a few months and that was when the relationship really took a dramatic turn towards the negative. What happened was Evan had begun making strange comments and threats to June and Dave and Jordan about Michael that he was going to make allegations. He was behaving so erratically, that they feared he was going to do something crazy So the next time they spoke to him on the phone, they tape recorded him. EVAN: This man is going to be humiliated beyond belief. He will not believe what is going to happen to him, beyond- beyond his worst nightmares. He will not sell one more record. If I go through with this, I win big time. I will get everything I want. They will be destroyed forever. EVAN: That's a fact, Dave. Michael's career will be over. DAVE: and does that help Jordie? EVAN: Michael's career will be over. DAVE: and does that help Jordie? DAVE: and does that help Jordie? EVAN: That's irrelevant to me. CHARLES: He's talking about how he's furious that Michael has stop phoning him and stopped taking his calls, and how Michael has stolen his ex-wife and torn the family apart and how he's plotting his revenge, and he says that, "Everything is moving in accordance with a plan that's not just mine." and this phone call occurred BEFORE Jordan Chandler made any allegations against Michael Jackson, and in this phone call, Evan Chandler alludes to a "nasty attorney". EVAN: This attorney I found, and I interviewed SEVERAL- and I picked the nastiest son of a bitch I could find. Once I make that phone call, this guy's just going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can do it. And I've given him full authority to do that. (chuckles) It will be a- a massacre if I don't get what I want. CHARLES: and that attorney turns out to be Barry Rothman. (somber piano music) My name is Geraldine Hughes. I was the legal secretary in 1993 for Barry Rothman, who was the attorney of Evan Chandler, the first accuser that came against Michael on child molestation. I was working for him, he hired me. When I came in for an interview one day, and he hired me for the job as his legal secretary. I was the only legal secretary for him. He was really an entertainment attorney and he had a history of being a good negotiator in the entertainment field, though. Whenever Evan would call Barry Rothman's office, Barry Rothman would tell us to put the call on hold and he'd walk all the way back to his office, shut the door, and that's how he took all of Evan's calls. He was the only client he did that for. Anybody else call, if he was at-away from his office, He'd just pick up the phone and say, "Okay.. woo woo woo" You know, say what he had to say and then he'd hang up. But he didn't do that with Evan. Evan was always behind closed doors. CHARLES: Evan had already retained a lawyer. Jordan Chandler was insisting that Michael had never touched him. Anthony Pellicano, who is Michael's private investigator, goes around to interview Jordan Chandler and questions him for about an hour, I believe, and asks him all sorts of questions, and very direct questions: "Have you ever seen Michael Jackson naked?", "Have you ever been naked in a bed with Michael Jackson?" "Has he ever touched you?", et cetera, et cetera and Jordan Chandler says "No" to everything. At the end of the conversation, Jordan Chandler reiterates that Michael has never done anything wrong to him, and says that his dad is just trying to get money. (somber piano music fades out) (up tempo strings fade in) GERALDINE: It started out a custody issue. Evan Chandler wanted the custody of Jordie because in order to coerce a child into saying something that's not true, you need time with that child. CHARLES: Evan Chandler goes to custody court and says, "I want to have a week of custody with my son," and June Chandler agrees on the basis that he'll be returned after 7 days. - And he never gave him back. He kept him. He never brought him back, and during that time that he had him, he came into my office and he was behind closed doors with my attorney the- the- Jordie Chandler was. I actually opened up the door one day. I was leaving, and I opened up the door and Jordie was in the back! And he kind of looked a little startled when- Because I looked and I saw him and I was like: Nobody in the office knew that he was even there. You know, we're like, "How did he even get here?" and I opened up the door, so I had a few encounters with Jordie Chandler coming into the office, and to me, it just looked like a coaching session. CHARLES: While Jordan was in Evan's custody, Evan sedated him with a drug called sodium amytal. He did this supposedly so that he could perform a dental procedure, But it's a very dubious story that he's telling because there's no reason to use sodium amytal for a dental procedure. He gives him this drug, which has a reputation in the 1980s as a truth serum. The problem is that sodium amytal is not a truth serum. In just around 1993, the evidence was beginning to emerge that in fact sodium amytal was the opposite of a truth serum. It made people highly suggestible. So, by today, by 2000s, Psychology Today and other journals were saying that it was completely false that sodium amytal had a reputation as a truth serum. - So, I'm just gonna take a step back for everyone. Evan Chandler makes a phone call to David Schwartz talking about how he is going to make allegations against Michael Jackson. Jordan Chandler subsequently denies all allegations. Evan Chandler then gets custody of Jordan Chandler and never returns him. It was only supposed to be for a week, and during this period that Evan Chandler had Jordan Chandler, there were numerous unethical methods that we know of being used against Jordan, notably the use of sodium amytal and the one on one coaching between Jordan Chandler and Barry Rothman. So by the end of Jordan's stay, he changes his story. He went into Evan's custody saying that he wasn't abused by Michael Jackson to now claiming that, "Yes, in fact, I had been abused." So Charles with this new shocking statement by Jordan Chandler, what are Evan Chandler's next moves? CHARLES: So after Jordan changes his story, Evan, instead of going straight to the police- as you'd expect a parent to do if their child has just said that they've been that they'd been sexually abused by someone, goes directly to Michael Jackson and his legal team and starts demanding $20 million. - But Evan had a desire to be a filmmaker. He was trying to get the money so he can make a movie. CHARLES: So when Evan meets Michael to confront him and demand the money, there were witnesses in the room who said that he threw his arms around Michael and greeted him with a hug, like an old friend. FIELDS: I was seated in our big conference room next to Michael and the father came into the room and saw Michael and went quickly across the room and hugged him and said, "Michael, it's been so long since I've seen you." which was just... flabbergasting! because here's a- (chuckles) here's a father claiming that this man had abused his son sexually and rushes across the room to hug him? Impossible! CHARLES: Evan's lawyer gets in touch with Michael Jackson's camp and says, “$20 million and nobody will ever hear about these allegations." But Michael Jackson is adamant that he is NOT going to give Evan Chandler $20 million. The counter offer which comes back from Michael Jackson's camp is a deal for 3 scripts and they say, "You'll be paid $350,000 per script." - He said, "I'll contribute that to your film project, just to give you and your son a chance to bond, to mend, because at that time, Evan was saying, "He's stolen my son's affection." He put that in the paperwork. He said, "My son is being starstruck by this superstar. He's stolen my friends affection". and so Michael just simply said, CHARLES: "This would be a great opportunity for you and Jordan to reconnect because you'll be able to write them together." Rothman comes back and says, "That's nowhere near what we're asking for. That's less than $2 million, you know? We're not going for that." Michael's camp then makes another offer which is for a single script paid at $350,000- a third of what they'd initially offered. Barry Rothman is shocked by the low figure. In response to that, Evan panics and starts trying to go back to the million dollar deal, and Anthony Pellicano comes back and says, "That's never going to happen." PELLICANO: Let me ask you for the last time: he has rejected the deal, period? ROTHMAN: For one project? Yes. PELLICANO: OK, so then there is no deal. ROTHMAN: Right! - Remember? I said take it or leave it- - Bingo! Bingo! - OK. Then we don't have to have a discussion about this again. - OK - Alright. - That's where it's at. - I've already told you that we think this is an extortion attempt from the beginning. Well you can say that! I've already made those statements time and time again. - You can say that, Anthony. I understand! but it fell apart because you offered 3 and then recanted on it. CHARLES: Meanwhile, the custody situation happens between Evan and June. GERALDINE: but what happened was June filed an ex parte motion An ex parte motion means: show up in court the next day. She was trying to get him back now, and so we typed a little declaration, and they went to court. The went to court on the ex parte, but see, he had been negotiating with Michael for a whole month for the $20 million to make the movie. He goes to court on a hearing for the custody, a family law judge, he said nothing to that judge about his "suspicion" or "my child is- I think my child is...", you know being molested. He didn't say anything. So the judge ordered him to return Jordie back instantly. CHARLES: And in order to maintain custody, Evan has to go to the psychiatrist and have Jordie disclose. - I can promise you 3 days later is when we got the breaking news, so he never took him back. He took him to the doctor that he had already queried about molestation. CHARLES: He sort of acts out of haste and goes and triggers the criminal proceedings as a knee-jerk reaction to the custody situation and then that means he loses control of the situation and the negotiations cease because the police are now involved. (tense music) ANNOUNCER: This NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw. BROKAW: Good evening. Michael Jackson is in Bangkok Thailand tonight, where he has now postponed 2 concerts, claiming that he is ill. While back in Los Angeles, there's a press frenzy over investigations into child abuse by Jackson. - ..remains the Children's Services report detailing the charges by a thirteen-year-old boy. - CBS News has had access to.. CHARLES: The media went into a frenzy because after the Michael Jackson case kicked in, basically their ratings went through the roof. It was astronomical the difference that this story made to the ratings of shows like "Hard Copy" and "A Current Affair". - I cannot think of a story that's bigger I mean, this is the story- if not of the decade, well certainly of the decade, but probably of the- One of the great stories of the century! CHARLES: This was an era with no internet and no social media, and so there was a real thirst for knowledge about Michael Jackson because he was the biggest, most famous person in the world, but people really knew basically nothing about him. There was a need to keep the story going every day They needed new Michael Jackson stories because that was where the ratings were coming from, so the impetus was there for journalists to seize on anything- anything that came up, anything that looked like a scoop or a scandal, or looked like it might bag them ratings, they just ran with it. REPORTER: We will fly stories. We will take a shred of fact and go with it, like a great footballer with a ball. We will spin down the field with that and try and score a goal with it, and maybe we will, maybe we won't, but we'll take a shred of evidence and try and try to turn it into a story. ("In the Hall of the Mountain King" plays) MICHAEL: I will say that I am particularly upset by the handling of this mass matter by the incredible, terrible mass media At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, as I am innocent. - When you buy a story, there's always the shadow of doubt that are they telling you the truth or are they telling you what you want to hear? CHARLES: They started waving around 10,000 20,000 50,000 $100,000 to anybody that was prepared to say, "I have met Michael Jackson and I've got something bad to say about him". - Yeah, a friend of mine told National Enquirer that he knew some family that knew the Jacksons and he called me on the phone, asked me to come to the hotel. I said, "I'm here to help Michael," and they said, "Oh, no, that ain't what we want with you- We heard that your boys spent nights at the house. We want to know if Michael tampered with them, or just picked them up, or touched them in any kind of way. If he did we got $200,000 for you". I said, "huh?"- He said, "So what I'm gonna do- I'm gonna draw a check up, a contract up. show you we're fixing to give you $200,000". - So then you go to Germany, you get another 20,000. You go to Italy, another 20,000. Before you know it, you're up a hundred a hundred, two hundred thousand dollars, and that is enough for a family to come forward and talk. CHARLES: It happened repeatedly where people of dubious character were treated as credible sources when anybody with just an iota of investigative savvy would know that these are not people you want to be staking your reputation on. They were people who changed their stories depending on how much money you offered them. BROKER: The first time I heard the story about, um, Jackson, his hand was outside the kid's pants. They were asking 100 grand. As soon as their price went up to 500 grand, the hand went inside the pants, so, come on. REPORTER: But basically, LaToya you're drawing your own conclusion that Michael abused young men, young boys - No, I'm not drawing my own conclusion that he abused young boys. That's totally- That's totally wrong. I am not drawing my own conclusion. CHARLES: LaToya Jackson at the time was married to a man called Jack Gordon who was involved with Genovese Mafia. He was a very disturbed character. He was very violent and abusive. He pimped LaToya out like a prostitute. He forced her to do semi pornographic magazine shoots- that kind of thing. and if she disagreed with him or refused to do anything that he told her to, then he would either beat her or he threaten to have members of her family killed. This went on for many, many, many years. He literally said I'm gonna kill you, your brother, - Everybody? - Yes. No, not everybody, just myself, Michael and Janet. CHARLES: This is not some excuse which has been dreamed up subsequently, this was known and reported at the time. - He grabbed a bedspread, he put it over her head, started to strangle her with it. At the same time, he grabbed her arm and started to twist it so badly that she felt like it was gonna come out. CHARLES: And so all of a sudden, LaToya, who'd been previously speaking out in favor of Michael suddenly u-turned started selling interviews claiming that her brother in fact was guilty. In early 1994, LaToya appeared on an Australian TV show and the host of the show realized that there was something wrong with the situation. He realized that all of the answers LaToya was giving were being fed to her by somebody else who he identified on the show as her husband, Jack Gordon. Well, Miss Jackson carried on with that nonsense for about another 25 minutes, all the time being prompted by someone in the studio, but off-camera, presumably her husband manager Jack Gordon. - People like you will let this go on and it's very very wrong. - Who's talking to you in the background? - Who's talking to you in the background? - So I... I... I refuse to sit here and listen to you - Who's... and listen to you talk this way. I think it's wrong of you. [Host] Who's talking to you in the background? - So I have nothing else to save you whatsoever. CHARLES: And when he questioned her about it on the air, she just looked like a deer in the headlights and suddenly stood up and stormed off the show and wouldn't answer any more questions. LATOYA: I can't hear you but I definitely want you to hear what I'm saying, because you do have a serious problem, sir. Whatever it is, I don't know, but you do need to go see a psychiatrist. Goodbye. CHARLES: Her husband decided that there was a lot of money to be made from switching sides and saying that Michael was guilty and indeed, there was. HOST: I'm sorry, are you feeling OK? Are you alright? Are you alright? Do you need a handkerchief or something like that? - After the allegation hit, they- prior to that, they were on opposite ends because June never did agree with the allegation But after the allegation hit, they were meeting in my attorney David Schwartz, June Chandler, Evan Chandler, and my attorney. They were all meeting behind closed doors in my attorney's office. - I decided to drop the case ‘cause I, at that time, as an attorney did not like to be involved in cases that I didn't believe in. GERALDINE: And I heard Evan blurt out, he said, 'It's my ass that's in danger of going to prison right here!' Inside the law office, the only thing they were asking for was money. "Where's his money? How much?" They were sending discovery in and the discovery was only trying to find his money. That was crazy too. I'm like, "Y'all just looking for money? You're not looking for justice? You're only looking for money?" (soft piano music fades out) JOSEPHINE: I mean, my mind EXPLODED when I- I found out who he was and I- I definitely told some people who were close to me I didn't confront him though, because at that point in time, you know- I knew that I believed Michael was innocent, but the fact that matter is I didn't know 100% and if there was even like- one shred of doubt, I didn't want to risk re-traumatizing somebody who was potentially a victim. And remember, at that point in time, Jordan Chandler was the only accuser and the media certainly wasn't focused on it. They were more focused on you know, Michael Jackson's new album release and um, you know, it wasn't all flattering but you know, it seemed like this- this was, you know, water under the bridge and something that didn't need to be addressed. He was a nice guy, I mean, I'm gonna be honest. He was he was very nice, always very polite. He would always carry a guitar around with him. He made his own music. He would describe it as "Pop/R&B like Michael Jackson". I remember that because he said it many times, very clearly. He would wear fedoras. Um.. Yeah, that was- that was Jordan. (sad somber music) REPORTER: What were your determinations when you examined him? - He seemed to essentially be a healthy guy. The lupus is an autoimmune disease and he only had skin involvement, which had destroyed part of the skin of his nose and his nasal surgeries and all were really reconstructive to try and look normal. - Lupus is an autoimmune disease, as you've said, where the immune system, one of our larger systems that's designed to protect us against germs and viruses, actually attacks our own body's cells and tissues. Many patients with lupus have vitiligo, but he had a form of skin lupus called discoid lupus which affect
