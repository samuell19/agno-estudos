Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Here's my fare. And if I say no? I'll come back tomorrow. Then the next day, the day after that, until you say yes. You don't love me! You took me for a fool and strung me along! You liar! Wanna go for milk tea? My treat. In your dreams! Suck on your milk tea! Get rid of your hoodie first, boy! Airhead, we're up for recitation! Tell her I have my period! - Good for nothing! - This is more important! Who's excited to see Paulo Avelino? - I can't hear you. Are you ready? - Hurry, sir! Let's welcome the most popular couple. Paulo Avelino and Bea Alonzo! Hi, everyone! I can't believe the crowd today! But wait. What is this I see? I'm not used to seeing the two of you being sweet. How does it feel to finally admit that you're more than just friends? It's driving me nuts! Tell us! Happy! It's liberating that we don't have to hide anymore. And you? Everyone probably knows how special Bea is to me. I love seeing her happy. It gives me shivers to see her as happy as she is now. And I just want to take care of her. Don't forget that this is a mall show! Get a room! Now, invite them to see your new movie! What is it? Paulo! He winked at me! - No, that was for me! - For me. That was me. - This is mine! - No, this is mine! Who's watching the movie? Yes, If We Fall in Love this Wednesday. Hope you catch it on its first day. It's Paulo like you've never seen before. Bea! Paulo! He's not even handsome. Seems ordinary and snobbish. Excuse me! He's so handsome. He's tired. Do you expect him to approach you? Paulo! Bea! Paulo! Move! Paulo! Paulo! Paulo! PAULO, YOU'RE SO HANDSOME. HAVE MY BABIES!!! Oh man. Sir, you've been swerving. Oh, good afternoon, idol. Sorry, I didn't recognize you right away. - Yeah. Sorry, boss. - Forget it. Just don't do it again. Idol, maybe we can do with tickets for If We Fall In Love. Sorry, boss, they didn't give me passes either. - I have posters though. Do you want one? - Sure, idol. - Thanks. - Thanks. Hold on. Could you make it out to my youngest, Catriona? - Catriona? You got it, boss. - Thanks. She's going to be so happy, idol. I heard you and Bea got together. How are the two of you doing? We're doing good. We were in the mall show earlier. - Here you go, boss. Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay, boss. Thank you. - Thank you as well. That's really Paulo, eh? Hey! Idol! There's someone in your truck! Paulo, give me a kiss! You idiots making me look gay! Son of a gun. I JUST SAW PAULO'S PRIVATES! HE'S A BIGGIE! Wait. Paulo? Who are you? What are you doing here? Hey! How did you get in here? Who are you? Get down! I said get down! Get down! Get down! - You think I didn't see your face? - Please stop. Stop! Son of a gun! If this gets out! You wench! I NEED YOUR HELP, FRIEND! Jay? Another mall show? I'm done with promotions for that thing. Jay, I only do two promos per movie, contract or none. Just do something about it! They don't even need me there. Bea can do it! I'm too tired, Jay. You guys ought to give me a break. Hello? Anyone there? What is it? A pack of Winnsboro, boss. - How much? - Eighty. What the hell happened? Man. Weren't you supposed to get the door? To hell with this. You always say you'll come out. Man. Man. Whatever. Later, okay? Bye. What was that? You stupid wench! Didn't I tell you to leave? Get down from there! Down! You don't want to? - Get down! - I'm going down, sir. Man. Please don't leave me. I'm your number one fan, sir! Don't mess with me! Go to hell! I saw I'm Drunk I Love You eight times. I watched Goyo three times. Never fell asleep during the whole three hours. I saw all of your movies with Bea Alonzo on the first day. I was in three block screenings. Two of those were lazy boy seats, 450 pesos. And I'll be watching If We Fall in Love on its first day, even if I skip my long trigonometry test. I'm a huge fan, sir. When's my birthday? - My dogs? - Two. Yoda and Chewy. What's my first TV show? On which network? Good grief. On ABS-CBN, 100 Days to Heaven. On GMA, The Magic Blouse: Black Jewel in The Palace. I'll take you to the bus stop tomorrow. You can stay with me tonight. Does that hurt? Hey. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey. Hey. Do I see a smile? Come on. Come on. You must have a weak spot. Hey. There. Smile now. Anyway, how did you end up here in my truck? During the mall show, you winked at me from the stage. - Yes. That was me. - Hold on. You're in a uniform. So you cut class? I wanted to see you, sir. - You very rarely come to our neighborhood. - Why me? Why not pick better-looking actors out there? You're the cutest of them all. That's it? Because I'm the cutest? What? That's all you can give me? What a waste of my Best Actor trophy from the Star Awards. That too. You're a great actor. You cry so well. What else? You're great at romance. What else? You're a good kisser. A good kisser? Where on earth did you get that? - From Bea. - Bea who? Bea Alonzo. Oh, that Bea. - Aren't you, sir? - Aren't I what? A good kisser. Man, if you weren't a kid, I'd have kissed you already. I'm not a kid anymore. Does it hurt? All done, babe. Babe? Babe, what? I said your wound's fine now. Thank you, sir. You can sleep in one of the rooms upstairs. Just shut the windows to keep the mosquitoes out. Are we sharing a bed? What? I don't feel like sleeping yet. What are we going to do, stare at each other? That's fine with me. Not for me. Go to bed. Man. Delete that. It might get around. Sorry, sir. Do you drink beer? Wait for me there. Here. What's wrong? This isn't the beer you're endorsing, right? No way. That one tastes terrible. What on earth. You don't even drink. Give it back. No, it's okay. - Give me that. It's not for kids. - It's fine, sir. Really. - Okay? Are you sure? - No, sir. It's okay. I'm no longer a kid. No longer a kid? You keep calling me sir! I'm no longer a kid. How old are you anyway? Almost 17, sir... Seventeen in November. Man. Sixteen? Suit yourself. But if you get drunk… Then I get drunk. Cheers. Don't drink it straight. You'll get drunk easily. I'm not a kid. How does it taste? Bitter? Bitter. But good. We have lots of those. Slow down. Man. Are you okay? Yes. I'm good. How come you're not drinking? Man. You're drunk. Wuss. Drink. I am drinking, see. That's not drinking. More like tasting. Aren't you Paulo the alcoholic? You're drunk every night in Poblacion. What on earth? Where did you get that? - From Twitter. - Do you believe what you read on Twitter? So are you an alcoholic or not? I like a good drink, but I am not an alcoholic. To hell with you, Pau! I'm the only one here, and you give a showbiz response. Whatever. Kampai! Kampai! - Is it good? - Man. Do you want to try? Man. If you expose me on Facebook… I won't. I'm too faithful to you. Man. You really do look cute. Even cuter in person. Can we take a selfie? And can you sign my poster? - Come on. - Good thing I'm in the mood right now. You're the best. Let's take a selfie first. Wait. Let me see. No, not that. No way. I look fat. - How do you delete this? - Let me do it. There. All done. Let's take another one. I'll do it this time. Relax. - You're too much. Just once. - Chill out. Just for the photo. - To hell with you. - Just this one as my remembrance. Thank you, Pau. Write something nice. I almost died for that. So, where do I sign? On Bea's face? Sure. So I can pretend that I'm her. Here you go. - Looks good. - Okay. Let's dance. I don't dance. I've seen you dance on TV. I'm paid to do that. Wow, a greedy alcoholic! To hell with you. Come on. Okay. Look at this. What is it? Not familiar. - I know that! - Man. Let me show you my moves. Really? Make sure you're good at it. To hell with you. Pay me for this. This asshole thinks he can dance. Why are you laughing? To hell with you. - Stop laughing. Try this. - You can't sing! Go away. To hell with you. Do you want some? No, I'm good. Man. What was that? Sorry, I just wanted to see if you're really a good kisser. Go to bed, you fool. You taste like vomit. I said go to bed! Man. I told you to shut the windows. What are you doing? Let's go eat. I'll take you to the station in a bit. What time do you want to go? The bus leaves every hour. I'm sure you know the way after you get to Cubao? Are you sure? I don't know where the bus stop is around here. That's why I'll tell you where you can board the bus, where you can get off, and where to go. Thank you, sir. What time did you fall asleep? Did you sleep well? It was okay. You didn't wake up? What? I'll go after eating. Man. Man! Bang your head with me. - Do it! - No! - Scream with me! - I said no! Man! What's your problem? Who was that? Who's what? Who was that? The one we passed! The one we passed? The woman we passed. Who was that? Which woman? The one you had sex with last night! Stupid idiot. I knew you were awake! What is she to you? - What is she to you? - Mind your own business! - Why are you angry? - Mind your own business! To hell with you! Wench! She has a family! She has a kid! I know! I'll sleep with whoever I want! You're not my mother! Retard! You're not my girlfriend! You're just a fan! Stupid fool! To hell with all you nosy retards! What on earth. Why are you crying? Stop crying. I love her. Inhale the smoke. Suck it in. Then go faster. Sorry for blowing up. The kid you saw with the woman… he's our son. Her husband doesn't have a clue. Why? Why are you staring? You cry like that in the movies. Different. You cry the same. - Different. - It's the same. I know better than you do. I've watched you so many times. Man, you're right. But I'm pretty sure the way I cried when I first saw Pipo was different. He was so small. Then… when Pipo turned one… I wasn't even invited. I cried like this. I couldn't stop crying. Me. When Papa told me that he was leaving us… that he was leaving Mama, this is how I cried. I love Papa so much, but I don't see him anymore. I remembered when I was on a shoot… when my sister called. Our mom was rushed to the hospital. I wanted to leave the film set, but they asked me to finish just one more scene. So I did. I was speeding on the highway when my sister called again. When I… went to the mall… I saw Papa. He was with his new family. I went to the bathroom. That's when I cried. I'll never forget that day. What if I didn't show up for work that day? Why did a stupid movie have to come first? She was gone before I could even get there. Then… Mama met Benjo. They were doing so well. I saw Mama was happy again. Then one night, I heard Benjo hit my mom. He was drunk. I heard Mama crying. It made me cry too. Then it happened again and again and again. I told myself I won't cry anymore. I won't cry anymore. Are we there yet? Around 15 more minutes. If I tell you I want to stay for a bit, will you be upset? Here you go. Your fart stinks! And yours smells good? No, it stinks, really. Idiot, you haven't brushed your teeth. Why is she calling? It's your mother. Answer it. No! - Answer it. - No! Don't answer it! She'll just yell at me! Oh. Hello, Ma? What now? Where are you? I'm coming home later. Benjo didn't come home again. He might be with his other girl. Why nag as if you're the legal wife? Hey, watch your words! Hello. Go home now! Yes, I'm on my way. Who are you with anyway? I'm with Shella. Give the phone to Shella. No, she's not here. Give the phone to Shella! She's not here. She went out to the store. I want to talk to her! I'm with Jeff right now. Then I'll talk to Jeff! - Give me that. - Ma, don't bother. - Hello. - Hello? - Are you friends with my daughter? - Yes, ma'am. Why? Tell your friend to come home now. Yes, we're on our way to the terminal. But if it bothers you, I can give her a ride. Okay. Good to know. I don't know what's up with that kid. She's quite a handful. Okay. Here she is. Hey. Only one beer left. Let's just share. Are you okay? What does that do? Many things. Depends on the person. It can make you laugh, it can make you crazy, it makes you cry sometimes. As for you, since it's your first time, it might make you feel like you're floating. Let me try. Just like how you smoke cigarettes? Just inhale the smoke. Just inhale the... There. After you inhale the smoke, just suck it in. Inhale it fast. It stings. Another puff. Take it in quick. Oh man. Why spit there? There's the pool. No, no effect at all. Let me try again. Give me that. Bend your finger like this. Twine it with my hand closed. See? Come here. Give it to me. Hand it over. Son of a gun! No, man! The water's dirty! Come back here. Are you crazy! Come here. Come here. Dry yourself up. I'll just get you a towel. Come with me. Am I a good kisser? ARE YOU STILL PLANNING TO COME HOME? BENJO, THAT FOOL, STILL HASN'T. Oh man! Hey, we already talked about this! You think I care? Come here now! Don't shout at me! You son of a gun! - Why the sudden temper? - Get off! Can you mind your own business? Why? Did something happen? I'm starving. Just buy me some food and cigs. What do you want? Whatever you want. - What if you don't like what I... - Man. Just buy whatever you want. What are you smiling at? You once said in an interview that if you prioritize a girl more than yourself, that means you love her. Are you drunk? Idiot. What if I don't want to. I'm here now. We're here together. We're taking Pipo out of here. You just can't wait. Man. - No. We're done. - We're done? You only come here when you're bored and alone. And you treat me like a wench. - This is not a family! - What's all the drama? I'm right here! This is what you want! We're getting out of this dump! No! Just stop! - Man. - I'm just a wench to you! But you love it so much! - Where are you going? - I'm taking Pipo. - No one's taking off. - Stop! You better stay out of it! - What else do you want? I'm here! - Who's this? None of your business! - Stop it already! - I've been waiting for three years! For so long, I've been waiting because you said... Stop! Stop it already! - Shut your mouth! - Just stop, please! - This is what you want! - Stop! Come with me, idiot! Follow me! Man! Mama! Faster! - Climb the fence! - Pau, stop it already. Just climb the fence! - Pipo! - Faster! Pipo! Hold on tight. She'll guide you. Hold on. - Wait. - Put your hand right there. Mama! I'm right here. Okay. Come on, quick. Take him. Pipo! Pipo! Faster! - Faster! Man! - Pipo! Pipo! Pipo! Pipo! Pipo! Mama! Pau! - Pau, what are you doing? - Stay out of it! - Stop this! - You're distracting me! Oh man. I'll bring you home, okay? Man. There. Your house is right there. Shut the window! Mama! I told you to shut it! - Pau, what are you doing? - Pipo! - Pau! - Pipo! Stop talking! Let's just stop! Don't you dare open the door. His father's right there! Stay out of it! Whose side are you on? - Pau, please... - Shut up! You're distracting me! Man. You're looking for trouble, aren't you! Man! Just shut up! Make the kid stop! Stop it! Man! You wenches are all the same! Man! You son of a gun! To hell with you! Hello, Ma? Are you crying? Benjo still hasn't come home. Didn't I tell you he's no good? I told you he's worthless. What happens now? He doesn't love us. He doesn't love me anymore. Janjan and I are here. - Please come home already. - Yes. I'm on my way. Stupid fool. - You bought too much. - Just eat it all. Fine. I bet there will be too much left over. Jane, come eat. Benjo brought home some chicken. Come. Will you look at yourself? You're a wreck of a woman. Hon, what happened to your head? Don't mind her. Just eat. I bet my own mother would strangle any woman looking like garbage. Messy is not a good look on women. Back in my day, she would have been hung from a tree or beaten with a belt until she learned her lesson. I don't know what it is in your genes. You're all a right mess. Right messes! She goes away for ages and comes back looking like trash. God knows who she hangs with. That's why she's never home. I even give her extra cash from the jeepney money, five or ten pesos. - Maybe she uses it to call her boys. - Benjo… - And where else did she get it from. - Of course. That's my kid. - She's still my child. - Trash, right? She comes home and not even a polite hi or hello. Let her starve if she doesn't want to eat. She doesn't appreciate the blessings I give her. Go buy me cigarettes. Please go, hon. Go get some change from my wallet. - I said, buy me... - Can't you get them on your own? What did you say? - Jane. - Ma! - Jane! - What, Ma? Please. Jane. Just obey, please. - Ma, what the hell? - Hey. You were going to obey anyway! - Go to hell! - Son of a gun! Freeloading trash! You're a son of a gun! To hell with you! One cigarette, please. What happened to you? How old are you anyway? Sixteen. Smoking at that age. Why don't you just do your homework? And a lighter too. Hello? Police station? Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
