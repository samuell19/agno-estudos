Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. It's absolutely perfect. Going fast, just like that. Love it. Love it. Love it. Oh, yes, yes. Okay, okay. Don't stop doing that, that's perfect. Oh, this is fabulous. Oh my. That is good. This is so good. Oh. Oh, shoot. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna be late for work. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry, Mark, I gotta go. But this, this was great. It was great. Oh, sorry, sorry. Hey, Beck. Successful morning? Oh yes. Yes, yes. Come here. I met this gorgeous lady selling her car. Beck, that's beautiful. After spending some time with her, it was obvious that she really didn't wanna sell it. So I told her I would send a copy. Oh, and by the way, Ash wants to see you. Oh, did he say why? Does he ever? Good luck? Okay. Oh, I like that one. Yeah, I'm aware it's got no budget. What does these days? Aha, aha. Jeff, I gotta call you back. Yeah. All right, bye. Hi, So the thing is... Beck, I'm just gonna come out and say it, I... That is City News. Hey. Hey. What are you doing home so early? Oh, Beck, really? Oh, oh, paint! I don't care. I don't care. Oh, but you love that job. I liked that job. I liked that it provided half the rent. Don't even think about that. You know, this could finally be your chance to go freelance, to do the work you really love. But, okay. I know how you feel. I've been there, and felt like I was in a free fall. But instead of grabbing the nearest branch, I found my wings. I don't know if I'm ready. That's nonsense. All right. Look, no one else is gonna say this to you. So I'm just gonna say it, but you've just been marking time since Mike, okay? And you need to move on, okay? Look to the horizon. Honestly, I was marking time even when I was with Mike. Mike is not the problem. I am the problem. I just don't know what direction is the right one. I just, I can't see that horizon isn't anymore. Well, give yourself something to aim for. Like, what if you won an award, then would you believe that you're finally ready? Rural Chic, out of the way places, quirky characters. That's so your thing. Girl, you could really ace this, and there is a cash prize of $10,000. That would be a whole new start. That'd be a new destination. I don't know, Susan. What do you have to lose at this point, really? I mean, if you just keep on waiting until you're ready, you're gonna be waiting forever. I'll do it. I'll find my wings. Yes, you will. So, what's the plan? Okay, that. Oh. That's what I wanna do. Very Rural Chic. But you can't just be Catherine Rose. No, no, no. This is all about the real me, about finding myself. Okay, well, do you have any idea where you're gonna find yourself. As it happens, I know just the place. It's this small little island town my parents took me to once, Serenity Island. It's really beautiful. Ow, still looking good, Serenity. Oh! Closed? I'm so sorry, ma'am. But I have a reservation. A problem with the plumbing. I'm afraid we had no choice. Isn't there another hotel? There is. It is however, full to capacity. I'm afraid we had to direct our guests there. So much for finding my wings. There is one other possibility. Lemon Tree Farm. A farm. Oh, it's a lovely place. A mile or so away. They have cabins there. I could check availability. I was really hoping to stay somewhere in town. You can get a cab from the square, but it's only a short walk, 15 minutes or so. Maybe coming here wasn't such a good idea. Let me check for you, it's the least I can do. Good news, I've spoken to the owner, Mr. Sweeting and there is a vacancy. Shall we say, yes? Rural Chic. Why not? Lemon Tree Farm, it is. Splendid. Oh, Okay. Give me the best you got Serenity. I'm betting everything on you. Oh, my. I'm so sorry! It's no problem, really? We keep a very clean fountain. Oh, oh. Just a ride? Yes. Yes. You realize you're doing that all wrong though, right? The coin. You gotta toss it over your shoulder for the wish to work? Oh, oh. Well see, that... That actually explains a lot about my life so far. Oh! Go ahead. Hey dad. Yeah, that sounds okay. No, I'm just in the square taking five, you know? Oh, she did. Will you tell Alice, I love her very much. And I'll see you in a few minutes. Okay, bye. Well, I hope you enjoy Serenity. You know what, I think I will. Okay, ah. Let's try this again. In for a penny. Hello. Oh, oh. Oh, my. I am so sorry. I was in my own world. Oh, no, that's... Hello, again. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I'm Beck. Beck Waterford. Are you Mr. Sweeting? Matthew Sweeting. That's my dad. Is there anything that I can help you with? Oh, I have a cabin booked for two weeks. Ah, I did not know that. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no, no. Not your fault. I can get you set up if I- Okay I- >>can just. Yeah, I really hope I haven't spoiled these. Well, it certainly saves tenderizing them. This batch is going to Junes. Oh, June's place. I saw the sign in town. Well, when life gives you lemons, right? I'm so sorry. You must get really tired of hearing that. Hey, when life gives me lemons, I'm a happy guy. That is so wonderful. Although, I suppose you might get a little tired of it too. Oh, no. Never. It's like... Oh, did you? Mm! it's very fresh. I mean, fresh is what I'm here for. So, and creatively speaking, I'm a photographer. Hmm. Serenity is a beautiful place. Well, I suppose I should show you to your cabin, Miss Waterford? Beck. Josh Sweeting. Ah, right this way. So this is one of the groves, we got about a dozen of them. Ah, can I take that for you? Yeah, that'd be great. It's tough to drag through here. Thank you. You know, if I knew you were coming, I would've fixed things up a little bit. Oh, oh, please, no. I didn't even know myself until less than an hour ago. All right, here it is. Take your pick. Ah, anyone? Three cabins, three vacancies. Okay, that one? All right. Well, it's not much, but it's clean and it's homey. Well, it's clean anyway. I'm sorry, is this gonna be okay for you? Oh, yeah. It's perfect. Rural Chic. Well, it's rural, and we can work on the chic. This isn't how it was meant to be initially. We always meant to do more with the cabins, but ever since mom passed, we- Oh, no, no, really. Sometimes there just isn't enough hours in the day. You know what, it's great. It has everything that I need, and I can pretty it up a bit, if that's okay? I mean, yeah, yeah. Hey. Hey dad. Dad, this is Miss Waterford. Miss Waterford, my dad, Matthew Sweeting. Apparently, Miss Waterford is to be a guest. I already know about all that. Glen from the hotel sent her over. Oh, Mr. Sweeting. Matthew, please. So what do you think about our promising holiday complex? We have plans to extend over to the next field and a trail just for the kids. Time and money permitting. I hope this young man is giving you a proper Serenity Island welcome. Oh, he's doing great. And it really such a beautiful place you have here, Mr. Swee... Matthew. Oh, Alice is looking for you, insist that she's cooking tonight. Well, better not keep her waiting. Ms. Waterford. Again, if you need anything, please, let us know. And, welcome. Great. Okay, fresh start. Okay, I like 'em. Hey, Susan. Hey there, how's it going? It's okay, I think. You, think? No, the place is just as exquisite as I remember. It's it's really beautiful, and- Okay, well, that's great. So, what's the problem? Well, there was something wrong with the hotel, so I'm staying on a farm. Oh, no. Okay, do not laugh at me. Oh, man. City girl Beck, in a farm yard. It's a lemon farm. And it smells amazing. It's actually really pretty. I could see it being a part of my portfolio. Well, it definitely fits the theme. And the guy that runs the place. Yes? No. Okay, you know that I'm not here for that. Besides, I'm pretty sure he's taken. Anyways, what I was going to say is that since he's so busy, I will be able to get on without any distractions. Well, good. Because you are already on a role. Have you seen your Pixar Post account numbers recently? People are already going crazy over Serenity. Oh, by the way, Catherine Rose just started following you. Oh, what? Catherine? Oh my. I'm I'm gonna call you back. Oh! Hey. Good morning. I hope that rooster didn't wake you too early. His time keeping is getting worse than mine lately. Oh, no, no. I just wanted to say thank you for the desk. Oh no, no. That was Josh. I hope you don't mind him putting it in there for you. You need it for a computer, right? That was very kind of him. So this is a work rather than vacation for you. Josh told me you're a photographer. Well, it's my passion as well as my work. So it's kind of both. Well, if you can combine those two things, that's the secret to a happy life. I love this place. Always have. Josh does too even though he doesn't want to admit it. That's why I came here. It had to be a spot that really meant something to me. Wait a second. You already knew of Serenity Island? Okay, so my parents took me on vacation here when I was seven. And you know what, it's actually where I took my very first pictures. Wow! It's where I fell in love with photography. Well, as you can see, it hasn't changed that much. I am struggling to remember what's where after all these years. What, you know what you need, you need a guide. Someone to take you into town and show you the good spots. Not with the touristy. That would be so terrific. Do you know anyone? I'm on a schedule and a budget. So I need to really make the most of my time here. What's this guy trying to sell you on now, huh? Well, Beck here needs a guide. Someone who could take her into town and show her the best spots. Wait a second. Josh, you could show it round? Oh, dad. I don't think so- He's Serenity, born and bred. Oh, that's really kind. No, no. Josh can take you to town. No problem, he's good. Dad. I really don't wanna impose. Who's imposing? You're here, Josh is here. Josh wouldn't mind. Right, Josh? Dad, we've got a business to run, and it's not doing too great. Sorry, no offense intended. Wait a second. What about a quid pro quo. All right, you say you wanna take pictures of this beautiful place. You say we need to build the business up. Make Lemon Tree Farm a proper holiday destination. So what do you say we work together. Josh is gonna take you into town and show you the most beautiful places to take pictures. And maybe you could share 'em with us for a leaflet or a brochure. We can get these cabins properly working, even throw it up on the web. It'd be super easy for me to just put it on social media. Whoa, whoa, easy. Dad, you know how I feel about that? Josh, doesn't do social media. Look the picture stuff, that's fine. But please, let's not go any further than that for now. Miss Waterford, I've got some things I need to attend to, if you'll excuse me? So don't worry about him. He's just little on edge. You know the farm, and- >>Yeah. I can find someone else. No, no, no, no. You just get that camera ready, all right? Dad, please don't make me feel like the bad guy in this. You know how much attention this place needs just to stay afloat. We've got irrigation problems, shipping backups. Big plans for the cabins are not at the top of the priority list right now. You know, there's a man, and he is in the forest. Oh boy, not this again. And he's trying to chop down this tree with a blunt axe, and a feller comes along and he says, "You know, if you just stopped and sharpen that axe," you'd work a lot better. And the man with the axe says- I can't do that. I Haven't got the time. You know this talk about rushing into schemes, make me nervous. Is that what you think this is? I mean, do you think Beck is really like that? Maybe she is, we don't know her. No, of course not. It's just- It's just what? Beck is here to take pictures, that's all. You can't keep avoiding. I'm not avoiding. Then humor your old man here. I think she's got something special. And this is different from before. And some, we could really use the help. And maybe, just maybe, you might enjoy yourself. Okay, fine. I'll do it for you. Just don't blame me if it turns out to be a waste of time. Okay, well Keeping your axe sharp- Is never a waste of time. Got it. Okay, I have about an hour. So ready to see the real Serenity. Definitely. I wanna go to all the places that no one else knows about. Tell the story of the real Serenity. What are these pictures for, again? Oh. Only I need to just keep on top of where these pictures go. We value our privacy around here quite a bit. Yeah. It's a personal project. You wanted to see the real Serenity? Well starts right here. This farm is it. Come on. So this house here was actually constructed by my great-grandfather who came to the island a while back, and believe it or not, he's actually the one who started the lemon grove themselves, and... Okay, taking pictures. Is that not okay? No, yeah. Whatever you need to do. It's just so beautiful, wow! Oh, one second. So how did you come up with this? Oh, you wanna see? Sure. Okay. So these porch edges here, they create these strong lead and lines that draw the eye from here to here. You see? Oh, yeah. And the basket serves as a sort of visual full stop. Texture is just as important as depth of field, for example... Show you this. Oh, wow! It almost acts like something of an abstract. Sharp and jagged, contrasted to the soft and the gentle, and it it's just... It's magical. Yeah. You know what I could really use is a human subject. Oh, yeah. No, no, I don't. I'm not a... I don't know if it's possible, but could you look anymore uncomfortable? Sorry, this isn't my thing. No. No. That was sneaky waterfowl. Oops! We've actually been told that our lemons are the sweetest. You know, no pun intended. That's a big compliment. Lemons are really resilient fruit so, we can actually bear with the different weather conditions. On one second. Yeah, sure. Hey, what's going on Jose? Oh yeah, these limits here. Let me see. So we have a little bit of a mic problem, Jose. But we're gonna have to introduce you to insects that eat 'em, because you know, we're losing some crops here. And this is gonna be good. We're gonna have to size some of these. So if we get the sizers like, I know maybe we gotta put in some more nutrients in the soil and see how- Sounds good. All right. Take care. okay. Hey. Wow, look at that meadow. Is that part of the lemon crop? It's the original grove. Wow! And this is the very first lemon tree of Lemon Tree Farm. Wow! My great-grandfather planted it. My grand father proposed to my grandmother under it, and my parents married under it. It's beautiful. You know, I never would've had you down as the farmer type when we met in the square. That guy in the suit. Yeah, that's not me. This, so much history. Well, lemons are meant to symbolize purity and also commitment, and everlasting love. If you believe in symbolism and why not? Yeah, maybe I do. Or maybe it's more about what this place means to me personally. You? My parents took me to Serenity on vacation. Happy times for us. They separated soon after. It's actually the last time I can remember us all together all happy. So this place has a special spot in my heart. But also it's really where all this started. My dad gave me my first camera here for my seventh birthday. When I was unwrapping it, he said, it's like drawing with light. Hey, look, I can see you mean well. And the pictures they are good. Really good. But we've got a lot going on here. And I'm happy to do this for dad, but I just... I really need to keep on top of this whole publicity thing. Brochures to go up in town and in June's place, that's all fine. But Absolutely no social media stuff, okay? Dad had a real bad experience with it a while back, and he forgets things like that. I don't, I'm just trying to protect him. Got it. So, shall we? Yes, please. So up this way is where dad was wanting to clear out some more land for some more cabins. Oh, what about this one? We haven't seen this one yet. Oh wait. Just a minute. That's a- Oh, my gosh. Can I go in for a closer look? Sure, but just- >>Thank you. Don't touch anything, please. Oh, this is incredible. Please, just be careful or I'm never gonna hear the end of it. Wait, Matthew? Hidden depth's my dad. Just don't let him know, I'm the one that brought you in here. Is that June from the square? Yeah. Yeah. I guess it is. Oh wow. Who's that? Ah, that, that's old. Okay now. Now that is just adorable. Well, you know, we do have one last stop to make, no tour would be elite without visiting Serenity zone Lemonade Cafe. Ooh, okay. And open Monday through Friday, including weekends, the Lemonade Cafe. Oh, the little girl from the paintings. Daddy! Beck, this is my daughter, Alice. Lemonade maker, extraordinaire. So this is Alice. It's so lovely to meet you. You can call me Beck. What do you love glass of my lemonade. I would absolutely love that. That will be accorded, please. Alice? No, no, no. It's fine. Honestly, you don't have to. I want to, really. Here. Okay. That is really good. It's my secret recipe. No, this could be the best lemonade I've ever tasted. Oh, it's all in the growing, of course. But mostly the secret recipe. Hi, I hate to break up this little party, but Matthew and I are taking Alice on a trip into town back. Beck, this is- >>June. I recognize you from the square. Oh, oh, you're the photographer. Oh, well it's lovely to meet you. I hope you're getting some good shots. Oh, it's so beautiful. I know. I may be a little biased, but I think you've come to the right place. Your glass is empty, would you like some more? I could sell you a whole bottle for $1. I have an idea. Why don't I take some of those bottles to my cafe for my customers, I bet we'll sell out no time at all. That'd be great. Alice, you know, what look really great out here? One of those paintings you did. Paintings? I never did a painting. Lemons and limes. Fine, lemons and limes. Go ahead, go get 'em. Oh, excuse me. Jose. "Lemons and limes?" Oh, that's a Sweeting family code. It's a citrus pinky promise, which means you have to tell the truth. Ah. It's taking off all over the island. Oh, wow. Yes. You can never lie if you get lemoned and limed. It's beautiful, can I see it? Yeah. Wow. So duty calls. Alice, you be a good girl for grandpa and June, okay? I Love you. Bye. Ladies. Will you do me a favor and go inside and see what's taking that grandpa of yours so long? That is really out the bag now. What's that, huh? Oh, nothing. I was just gonna ask, is there a Mrs. Sweeting? There was, she passed away. Oh yes. I heard about that. I was talking about Alice's mother. I meant that too. It was a long time ago now. Alice was very little. Doesn't remember anything, but it's Josh that it was tough on. I'm so sorry to hear that. And a few years back, Matthew lost Porosa. We saw that one coming, doesn't make it any easier though. Terrible, they both had to lose a loved one that way. Suppose it brings them closer, both being widowers, but there are some experiences you just don't wanna share, you know? Matthew gets on with life though. That's his way. But Josh is... Although I must say since you've arrived, Josh seems to be coming out of his shell a bit. Hey, Hey, Hey. They you go, hey. Hey, hi. We better get going. The little one here says, ice cream time. True, true, true. See you soon, Beck. See ya. Bye. Hi Susan. Hey, how's it going? It's just, it's wonderful. And the scenery, oh, it's breathtaking. And the people are amazing. And your farmer guy over there isn't too busy to get involved. Involved? With the photography, I mean? Oh, yeah. No. But here's the thing, he's actually just kind of weird about the whole social media thing. I think he'd freak if he knew his farm was in a international photography competition. Here, hi. Beck. Oh, hi. I don't know what you're doing, but it's working. I just booked another cabin. That is so great. Yeah, they said they heard about the farm on, Pixar Post? Oh dear. Okay, I'm not in trouble, am I? I've- >>Not with me. Look, Josh doesn't need to know. Okay, he's funny about all that stuff. But if they're paying customers, I don't care how they heard about it. Our secret? Okay. Okay, look, I gotta get back. I got some stuff for the cabins. Oh yeah. Hey, hey. Celebration portrait before you go? Oh, okay. Okay. Love, Z. I'll see you later. Okay, bye. This is great. This is great. Okay. Hey, Beck. Hey. Are those yours? Do you mind if I take a look? Sure. Oh, wow. What are numbers ticking up? That is the number of people that like the photo. You're kidding. Well, you certainly have an eye. Oh, who's that old lady that looks like me. Oh, stop it. You look great. And all of these other people clearly agree. A like is a big deal. Look at that old fool. What? Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Hey, Beck, you think I could have a few copies of this shots? Oh, of course. I'll put together a selection when I get back my cabin, and just gimme your email, and I'll send them. You wouldn't happen to like the photo of Matthew as well, would you? Next gelatos on me. Got it June. Wow. Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's more than okay. Why wouldn't it be okay? Oh, oh my. Okay, so this shot that I just uploaded of the lemon. Oh, a couple... A couple that just bought lemons from your farm, I got this beautiful photo of them. Look, it's already gotten over 1,222 likes. 23 likes. See, people are really loving Serenity, Josh. That's great. Yeah. Hey Alice, would you mind giving me a hand in the cafe? Yeah. So that picture, they're not actually loving it, right? I mean, not really. Nothing against your photo, of course. Just not a real connection. Okay, Grandpa. No. I just... I mean. Okay. What is with your great war on modern technology? Okay, I get it. There was the thing with Matthew, but he actually seems totally okay with it. Okay, you are the only person I've ever met under the age of 70 that doesn't own a smartphone. You know, I got some great ringtones on this guy. I don't know. And I remember a time before people all had their faces just stuck to their phones. Connections between people can start with something silly or trivial and unbuild. I mean, just because it doesn't start off with something big doesn't mean that it can't turn into something real. Okay, okay, fair. For some people, maybe it really is just a tap on a screen, but maybe some of those people will actually come here, Just like I did when I was a little kid, and make unforgettable family memories, stay in your cabin, learn about Lemon Tree Farm. And how is that not a real connection? I mean, it's not that different than how you and I are... We're connecting right now. Sorry. No, no, it's... There's nothing to be- Exhausted myself. I can tell. Beck, look, I know it's me, and I should really explain. I just- >>Oh, oh. What, what is it? She's actually here. Who is that? It's Catherine Rose. I mean, she's here. She's actually here today on Serenity Island. That's a good thing, right? Josh, she is my most favorite photographer in the entire world. I mean, she is so I influential. I wonder what she's doing here. Oh, my. Oh, my. Do I even look okay? You look great. I just, I wanted to tell you that- I have to go over there. I have to go over there right now. I'm so sorry, Josh, can we pick up with this later? Yeah, sure. Okay, thanks. Sure. Catherine Rose. Beck's World, right? Just Beck. Well, how do you do, "Just Beck?" Wow! This is amazing. I took your photography workshop five years ago, and it helped me land my first proper photography job. Oh, I'm so happy it worked out for you. I just, I cannot believe you're here. Well, partly thanks to you. Me? Really? Your pictures of Serenity are riding wave right now. I just, I had to see the place for myself. Wow! Yeah. Serenity is really unique. It's got so much soul. So when I found out that this year's destination competition theme was Rural Chic, well- You're going for the Destination award? Yeah. Is that crazy? No. No, you just totally do it. It's a great idea. I mean, that award launches careers, you won it when you first started. Right, and look at me now, just spinning all the plates. I'm really hoping to win this year. Well, very best of luck with all that. Hey, you know, maybe we could take some pictures together if you're okay with that. I'd love to pick up some tips. Well, sure. I just, I wouldn't wanna get in your way. No, no. You know, what I really need before anything is a shower and a change of clothes. Ah, why am I not liking the sound of that, ah? I'm so sorry, but the only hotel is closed, and the only second option is full. Oh, oh, no, no. I already have a room booked. Lemon Tree Farm. Oh, you've created quite the buzz for it online. Hi. Hey, could I talk to you for a second? Yes, of course. But first, let me introduce you. This is Catherine Rose. A Photographer. Style director, influencer campaign manager. Yeah, I seem to be doing just about everything these days. Delighted to meet you. Josh Sweeting of lemon Tree Farm. The famous Lemon Tree Farm. Oh, no. I wouldn't say that, but- You know, she's gonna be staying in one of your cabins. Isn't that super great? The cabins. Yeah, that's great. How did you even- You know what, we should really let Catherine get some rest. She had such a long trip. I'm sure Matthew would love to help you get settled in. And I can tell you all about how she inspired me. Welcome, Catherine. We'll see you at the farm. Can I get you anything, honey? I'll have what she's having. It's funny. All those years ago, I took my very first picture right at this fountain. Wow, that's a really ignited a lifelong passion, didn't it? Yeah. So what's your story? Were lemon's always written in the stars? Actually, no. Not at all. When I was a kid, all I ever wanted to be was a pilot. Fly the world. Wow. So what happened? An airline pilot's license, that's expensive. I worked in the city a while to pay for it. Hated it, obviously. Just not a city boy at heart. Yeah, all those knuckleheads with their heads and their phones. I guess that was part of it. In some ways, it was some of the best times of my life. I got married, we had Alice. My wife, Chloe, she died out of the blue. It's just one of those things like, there was nothing you can do about it. And I was done with the city, I left. So I came back to the farm. And mom was already gone and dad could use the help, but he was worried that I was given up on something. I was given up on my dreams. And maybe I was too, a little bit. But I tell you, as soon as I stepped foot on this farm, I remembered how much I missed it. You shine anytime you talk about Serenity. I do, usually. My dad and I ran into some problems. Big problems. He almost lost everything into some online scammers. Everything? Whole farm, almost. They reached out to him on social media. So that's it. Acted like they wanted to help, pretended to be his friends, they weren't. But I helped him through his tough times, and he helped me through mine. So, here I am. Much as I love it, though, it is a forever growing challenge. I should really put more time and effort into those holiday cabins, 'cause we're gonna need to diversify if we wanna survive. Last week, those cabins were empty, and now they're filling up. I'm grateful. I really am. Yeah, maybe I need to pull myself into the 21st century a little bit, but we're gonna have to throw everything we can at it to keep this place going. Yeah, well, this gives us a start. So you ready? Ready? Family barbecue. Oh, I'd love to. Just give me five minutes. What For? To change. Oh, I think you look fine. Oh my goodness, you are serious? Wow. No, I'll be right there. All right, bye. Okay. Oh, so about June and Matthew. Oh, gosh, no. They're just friends. Oh yeah. You sure about that? Wait, do you think that... Oh my, you've really never noticed. ♪ Lemons and limes Oh my. Men, hopeless. Beck, I'm loving what I'm hearing about these plans you have for the farm. I must admit I'm a little envious for my little cafe. Oh, stop. June's place is charming. Yeah, it's just looked the same forever. Well, they don't go there for the decor, June. Well, you could always give them another reason to go in there. Oh, so honey. What if I told you that I know of an amazing artist whose works on the walls would absolutely transform the place. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no, no. That is a marvelous idea, Beck. I love it. Right? Yes. And you could hang them like in a proper gallery, You could even put them up for sale. Okay. Guys, come on. Who's gonna buy my old paintings. Matthew, your paintings are great. It's a crime to keep them locked up in that studio. And I'm certain that there are other visitors to Serenity that would love them too. And don't blame Josh for this, I was the one that snuck in there. Well, I'm all for it, and it's my place. Maybe you two could get together and pick out a few that you like just to get a feel for what it might go where. Oh, no. What do you think, June? I was sure five minutes ago, man. You're the only one holding us up. Okay. I need to think about this, all right? I'm gonna get a top up. Anybody want anything? I just know this is... I gotta... I don't know. Yep, just think about it. Hold on. Don't worry. I'll bring them around. They're stubborn, these Sweetings. What are you talking about? Ask Beck? Hey. Okay, Alice. So this is something I used to do with my dad. It's called night riding. Night riding? Whoa! It's drawing with light. Yeah. Here, come on. I'll show you how to use it. Go ahead. Right. And I want you to hold it out, come over here. Like a magic wand, okay? And I want you to draw whatever you want. What's your favorite shape? Heart. Okay, see, heart. Go ahead, draw it. Whoa. It's perfect. What about, write your name. There you go. Okay. A-L-I-C-E. Hey, Alice, do you think we should let your dad have one too? Yeah. Okay. Okay, all right. Let me draw one of the lemons. Okay. Here we go. Draw big circle, ooh. And then get the leaf on top. That's perfect. Morning neighbor. Good morning. You're headed out already? Yeah, gotta take a few shots in town before it gets busy. Catch the early light. Hang on, I'll be right over. May I? Yes, yes. Of course. Please, come on in. Be my guest. I like these, Beck. You know, the Destination competition could be a real springboard for you. You have a real shot at it. Let me just try one thing. You see what the competition judges really want, is story. Everyone loves a story. I've gotta run. A story? Morning, Josh. Max. Yes. No, I'm in Serenity. Serenity. Oh, well, what difference does it make? You haven't rustled up any work in weeks. But about that, I've had an idea. I'm going to enter the Destination competition. I need this, Max. My career needs it. Hey. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Lemons and limes. Turns out growing lemons isn't quite the perfect picture you wanted it to be. That day we first met by the fountain, I had just come back from a meeting with the bank, and this was their decision. I always knew it'd be a long shot, but boy, I was really hoping for this to work out. And for a while, I actually thought we were getting ahead at this. This is one of the things I was trying to tell you. The whole reason I've been all over the place lately. What does this mean for the farm? I have a way to bail us out for a while, but unless we can improve things longer term, I honestly can't see us making it through the year, we'll have to sell up. What? No. Josh, you can't. This place, it's the essence of Serenity, of you, the groves, the lemons, the tree where your grandpa proposed to your grandma. It would break my dad's heart. But What can we do? There is more we can do, if you trust me. Trust you. Let me push the farm online. Hey, I know you're gonna wanna say no, but just hear me out. We can really sell it. And not just here, all over the country. And then you can diversify, add more cabins, and get totally new income alongside the harvest. Wait, Catherine said the famous Lemon Tree Farm. Did you put pictures of the farm online already? Maybe just one or two. Beck, you agreed not to. A personal project, you said. It couldn't be more personal, Josh. People are going crazy for it. And this gives us a head start. I can build on this if you'll let me. Why not? What else can I do? Yes. Okay, everyone loves a story, right? What this place is all about, what makes it so special, I just, I wish there was a way that I could capture that in a bottle. Okay. What? Okay. Oh, what do they always say? When life gives you lemons... Okay, listen up. Bottled Serenity. Beck, we're gonna have to sell a heck of a lot of lemonade just to even- Josh, Josh. It's not about the lemonade. It's about you, your family's history. Okay, just listen, all right? If we get Alice to sell this at June's place, I mean, heck sell it all over town, everywhere, and I can set up a store for you guys online, Josh, we can get people talking about it, get them here. We have a bunch of pictures and people, they're just enchanted by it. They really are. So why not give them a proper taste of Lemon Tree Farm? Tell your story. We can let Alice take all of the limelight. Josh, what do you have to lose? If we don't do this, everything. Cruising the job ads again? Take a look. Wow, what a shot. This is a real gift. And that would be the photographer you recently fired. It's Beck? Yes. Wow, she is good. Yes, she is. Dad, dad. I got this. Good. All right, are we all ready? Think so. Yes. Welcome everyone. Welcome. Hi. Hi, welcome. We have a wonderful new photographer and a local painter. Don't forget to check out the local lemonade made by the one and only Alice Sweeting. Yeah, so all homemade, get it all from the lemon grove. This is Matthew Sweeting farm. He runs our local lemon farm here, where you will also find- The next step will be your own E gallery. Oh, that's great, right? Beyond great. It means the people from all over the world can see your paintings. Sorry to interrupt Mr. Sweeting. Your public calls. It's quite the setup you have here. Oh, you name it. I've got it. You know, I am glad I came here. I'm glad I saw your work connected with it. It reminds me why I got into all this in the first place. I'm really glad you came too. I mean, finding the story in my work, it's helped me more than you could know. Excuse me, guys. I got the truck pulled around the corner, I'd like to show you something. Right now. Ah, yeah. Okay, well, if you don't mind. Oh, heck, I'm surprised you're still standing here. This way. Oh Catherine, what have you become? Someone who talks to herself. That's what. All right. Here we go. Okay, so I am sufficiently intrigued. Oh, you know, I just wanted you to meet someone. Someone? The one member of the family you haven't met yet. Okay, long lost aunt. Beck, meet the Dutchess. Hi. I'd really like to take you up. Wait, what? If you'd like to, of course. You mean fly? That's what she does. In the plane. I find that's the best way to do it, yeah. Besides how are you gonna see the real Serenity? My Serenity. Yes. And here we go. Serenity, here we come. Ow! You okay there or afraid? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Ow, wow! Ah, that's beautiful. That was incredible. Oh, that's gonna stay with me for a long, long time. Just as well. That was probably the Dutchess' farewell flight. Oh, what? I said, I had a way to get us out for a while. The Dutchess is it. Look, if selling here is what I need to do to give us even a few more months. So I'll do that in a heartbeat. That's why I want him to take you out today. Say thank you. Even if all this doesn't work out. No, No. We're going to make sure it does. Trust me. I do. Josh, the photos, the publicity, it's all really working. And there's something else. I might come into some money. It's a real long shot. But if I do, I'd like to help. You know, I couldn't take that. But I want you to. It really is such a beautiful night. Yeah. Every star clears a beacon. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, look that constellation there, that is the great bear. Is it? Yeah, I mean it's so obviously a bear. Well, maybe someone who's never seen a bear before. Have you ever seen a bear, little city girl? Do Teddy bears count? Mm, barely. Okay, well, that right there is the it lawn chair. Oh, we're in for a treat. This is very rare, indeed. Okay. All right. I want you to look slightly to the right of the lawn chair. All right, looking. That is the hamster. Hmm, yep. Yeah, you can see the little wheel right there too. You know, when we were kids, we used to come out in the meadow just like this and we watch shooting stars. Yeah, well, I can't imagine a more perfect place to do something like that. And that is why I love these things so much. So much. Hello? Yep. All right, yeah, I'll be right there. Bye. Well, that was my dad. And we'd love to invite you to dinner. I'd love that. Oh, hey beautiful. Hey dad. Thank you so much for setting up. Yep. Yeah. We'll set you right here, Beck. Sorry. All right. All right. Hot dish coming through. Oh, gotta set it right here. I cannot wait for you to try my specialty. Guess whose lemonade was on the local news tonight? No. you mean like on TV? Yep. Am I famous? I mean, getting there. Thanks to Beck. To Beck. To Beck. To Beck. Yeah. Ow! And to Catherine Rose. I mean seriously, without her inspiration and influence, I wouldn't even be here with you guys. Is Catherine a famous movie star? No, she's actually a famous photographer, and she was kind of a hero. Do you wanna be like her? Ah, that's a good question. You know, I used to, but now I'm thinking I kind of wanna find my own way. And was your pictures that brought her here? Catherine's entire early approach is what influenced my career. But photography is very competitive, and you have to keep adapting. Keep standing out. I Think you, stand out. Thank you, Alice. Hey Ash, what can I do for you? Beck, how's it going over there? Pretty good. Good. All right, so listen, I'm gonna get straight to the point here. Jack Owens, he's up and taken early retirement. Good for Jack, I always liked him. Yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too. Great guy. Any who... So that has left me one travel photographer short. Aha. And Tabitha showed me the photos you posted. Beck, they are amazing. I had no idea who had that kind of talent. Thanks Ash. That's kind of you to say. What I'm trying to get at here, there is a job with your name on it back here, travel photographer. It's got a good salary, it's got a pension, same as Jack got. Immediate start. Ash, can it wait just like a few days? There's something here... There's some one here that is depending on me. Beck, I need you here. I mean, there's jobs to cover for the end of this week. Beck, are you still there? I'm still here, Ash. I kind of need a yes or a no here. Yeah, you know, I'm gonna have to call you back, Ash, bye. Max, Max, I hear you. Just a couple more days. Okay, I need this. Trust me, I'm nearly done here. And if this doesn't clinch the competition, I'll get out of the business. Listen, Max, I gotta go, okay? Yep, we'll talk later. Yep, bye. Bye, bye. Beck. Hi. See, you're keeping busy here. Yes, this morning is all about marketing. Gotta keep up with the self publicity or people think you've gone to hibernation. Do you mind if I ask, I heard you mention a competition. I overheard, that was rude. I just... I'm worried, because- No, it's okay. Full disclosure. I'm going for the Destination competition too this year. I should have said. I know, but there were always gonna be other people in the competition, right? Sure, but- That's the spirit. Serenity was meant to be my story. Honey, Serenity doesn't belong to anyone. You knew what I was doing here. You saw my pictures. You came here because of my pictures. But, you just do your thing and I'll do mine. Okay, planning to go around, right? And may the best woman win. Hey. Hi. You okay? Yeah. Catherine here was just sharing with me all the ways she's gonna help put Serenity on the map. Well, that's good. I have to charge my battery. She does remind me of me once upon a time. Kind of I was back there. Is everything okay between you two? Beck's just a little upset about me being in the competition. Competition? Yeah, You know, the Destination Photography competition. Destination what? She didn't explain. It's one of the most significant competitions in the industry. It launched my career. A win for... Either one of us is a win for Serenity. Either one of you. Beck told you she was in it, right? Oh, she didn't. So this all been about a competition. Well, if Beck were to win, it would of her career a huge kickstart. I gotta say, Lemon Tree Farm is a great subject. It's just all the right elements. It's a winning story. And it's got social media buzzing, the judges love that kind of thing. A winning story, yeah. She really didn't tell you about this. No, she really didn't. Josh, it's not a... I need to talk to you. Sure. Why didn't you talk to me about the photography competition, hmm? Is that all this has been about? The pictures, the paintings, the lemonade, and helping out on the farm? No, of course not. No, you know, I'm starting to think that maybe this has just been about providing a happy ending for your story. That it's not about Serenity or Lemon Tree Farm, but for Beck Waterford. What? No, no. I've tried to be helpful since I got here. I never asked for you to come here. Are you saying that you don't need that help? Because from where I stand, it kind of looks like the future of your farm depends on it. And you know what, I would've been a lot more straight with you if you didn't have this absurd phobia of the internet. Don't act like you understand a half it, 'cause you don't. I understand what happened to Matthew, that people were pretending to be friends and promising miracles. And I understand you wanna protect him. That's not it. And I wanna protect him too- That's not it. It's what it did to me personally. What it did to Chloe. What? You know, I used to be fine with social media. And then when Chloe died, the grief, that was hard. You know what's even harder? The sympathy. Message after message, post after post. These people, they didn't even know her. Not really. In the end, it wasn't even about Chloe. Each person was trying to outdo the other to show how much they care. And it finished me, I was done. That is truly horrible, Josh. I'm so sorry, but why would you take it out on me? Because I cared about you. 'Cause I trusted you. And I haven't felt those things in a very long time. Yeah, yeah, that's him. That's absolutely him. No, no. Look. It's really him. Hey, you like Beck, don't you? I love Beck. Okay. Come on. Let's go. Come on. You can't find her. She couldn't have just disappeared, no way. Oh my. Dad, you okay? I just sold my first painting. What? Oh, my! How? How did you sell it? Well, a guy saw it on an internet site that Beck set up, and I said, yes. Dad. Look, I know what you're thinking. Okay, you already sent them money through when we were talking on the phone. It's crazy what you can do these days. Well, how much? 15. $15, dad. 15,000. And that's not just it. I'm gonna get emails left and right about the cabins. So this could change everything, all right? Listen, if we do it right, if you and me work together, we're gonna make it. And you can keep your wings. And we have Beck to thank for that. Right? We have a lot to thank her for. Now, don't be an idiot. You go find her. What if it's too late? Too late? Son, I just started a career as an artist. And I just asked June out on a date. Look, I took a chance. And so should you. You're the one who's flying that plane all over the sky. Life's too short. And you and I both know that. Hey, Lemon Tree guy, right? I love that guy, did you see him? Josh? Ah, where is she? Try down at the fountain. Hey, Ash. I was actually meaning to call you. Well, I wanted to say that it is a fantastic offer. It's a dream job, really. How could I say no. You leaving already? But what about Josh and the farm? No, I just, I made a whole big mess of things here. Mess? Are you kidding me? Wait, you're you are leaving. It's for the best. Also you should know I'm withdrawing from the competition. Please tell me you aren't okay, I'd like at least one thing to work out. Withdrawing. Why on earth would you do that? I was doing it for all the wrong reasons. I thought I was trying to recapture my passion, but really I was just trying to be you. Wait, you were trying to be me. I know. You wanted to be like me, and now I wanna be just like you. But Beck, don't try to be like someone else. Okay, I fell into that trap. But now I'm gonna go back to my roots for a bit. Ditch the gear, and hit the road, you know, see what happens. So thank you. Thank me for what? For inspiring me. Now, there's something that you need to see. Oh. Honey, he's crazy about you. I see it. Everyone sees it. Everyone, but you. So please, just tell me you're gonna go find your lemon farmer and declare your undying love. I don't know. Beck. You're here. Yeah. Somehow I ended up here. I thought you left. Josh, that was so wrong of me to keep everything from you. In the competition? You have to do it. You'll win, I know you will. You know what? I think I'm going to. Thank you for believing in me, and for reminding me of what actually matters. Hey, thank you for showing me how to trust again. And dad sold a painting, thanks to you. 15. 15,000. That was your first guess? So the Dutchess is staying. Yeah, I hear she's not the only one. Do you need a cabin? 'Cause I hear they're filling up pretty quick. Oh, well I do love it here. I mean, the groves, the lemonade. Hmm, the lemonade. And of course, there's the giant hamster wheel. Lemons and limes. Yes, yes, yes.
