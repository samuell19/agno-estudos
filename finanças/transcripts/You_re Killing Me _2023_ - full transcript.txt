[arrows whooshing] [thunder rumbling] [Boy in recording] What is it? [Girl in recording] Can you stop filming me? [Boy] Yeah. -It's a heart. -Little heart? -[pensive music] -[students chattering] [Teacher] All right, settle down, class. -[hands clap] -[Teacher] Hey. Settle down, class? Thank you. We have a guest here that would like to talk to you about a very important issue. -Detective Mitchell? -Thank you. Hi everyone. I'm investigating the disappearance of your classmate, Melissa Brown. A daughter, a sister, and a dear friend of many of you. This case has been frustrating and heartbreaking for all concerned. Unfortunately, at this point in the case, we suspect foul play. Any detail could be vitally important in helping us locate her. [Teacher] And as always, Counselor Fink's office is always open if you guys need to talk. Okay? Notebooks out. [school bell ringing] [pensive music] [students chattering] [tense music] You know this girl? Hey, Schroder. What's up? Hey, so this is kind of awkward, but your dad is on the board at Penbrook, right? You want me to put in a good word for you, don't you? Someone else already asked you to do that? Yeah, just you and every other scholarship kid at this school. Well, difference is I'm actually just wait listed. So, I was thinking maybe if your dad could write me a letter of recommendation that would help swing things in my favor? Yeah, that's not really how this works, but I wouldn't expect you to understand that. I mean, we barely even know each other. We've been in every class together since freshman year. Right. Uh... Maybe you should just call my dad's office. I have tried, multiple times. His secretary just keeps telling me that he's busy. So I thought-- There you go. He's a busy guy. His dad's a fucking congressman, bro. -[Shroder] Busy guy. -What the fuck do you expect? Hey, are you still having your Heaven and Hell party tonight? Do you see this man's face? Yeah, it's to be expected. [Kendra] It's a theme party, in case you didn't catch that. [car starting up, doors closing] Hey. Hey. Well, what was that? Um, we're gonna go to a party tonight. -His party? -Yeah. Yeah, no way am I going. Yes, it's gonna be fun. We hate fun. Well, this... Is this about Penbrook? Okay, so what's your plan? You're gonna, what, use Schroder to get to his dad? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know, this might be my only chance, and you're not gonna leave me behind. Of course not, but we're not even invited. You don't have to be invited to a high school party, you just show up...um, in themed costumes. [Zara] Nope! [tense music] [Dad] That's your Mama's coat, isn't it? Huh. Are your girls cold or something? Actually, I like my body being covered up. Thank you. [Dad] All right, Zara. [chuckles] Y'all are in the fancy part of town, I'll tell you what. Why don't you hand out some of these business cards for me at the party? Dad. Actually, you can just pull over. Right here's fine. [Dad] Mess up this guy's grass. [laughing] [Eden] Dad, stop. Dad, Dad, stop, stop, stop, stop. -Stop, okay. -[Dad] I stopped! [Eden] Thank you. [Zara] Thanks for the ride, Mr. Murphy. [Dad] You're welcome, darling. Y'all have fun. [Zara] Okay. -For you? -Oh, god. You actually bought them. [Eden] Oh, Dad? Hey, what are you doing? [Dad groans] I'm just gonna walk you over there. [Eden] No, it's okay, Dad, it's okay, your back. I don't want you to strain your back. [Dad] I want you to be safe. [Eden] It's okay, it's just, it's right there. We'll be fine. All right, you win. [Eden] Thank you. Okay, well, we'll call you. I know. 'Cause if you don't, I'm rolling right up to the front door in my baby here. [Eden] God, I hate how much you love this car. [Dad laughing] Okay, we'll call. Bye! Not as much as I love you. The wings look good! -Black is a nice touch. -Yeah, I like them. [Zara] So excited, you know? [Eden] I can hear your sarcasm. [Zara] I cannot believe you're making me do this. [Eden] It's not gonna be as bad-- I mean, look at them, they're already leaving. Clearly it sucks. [Eden chuckles] No. -Zara-- -Please. Come on, Eden, seriously. Look at this fucking house! [Eden] Listen to me, okay? I have a plan, and it's gonna go so smoothly, and we'll be super fast, and if while we're here, you know, Schroder decides that we're besties and he wants to introduce me to his dad, and then I get to go to Penbrook with you, then all this is worth it. You really think that you're gonna become besties in one fucking night? Schroder sucks. -Listen-- -Schroder sucks. I know he does. But here's, okay-- Let's maybe not look at how everybody else is dressed. No, listen, it's all gonna work out, okay? And we're gonna be roommates next year. We just have to do this. It's gonna be great. I swear I have a plan and it's gonna be so quick, and then we can leave. [Zara] You're so good at being so manipulative. [upbeat music playing on speakers] [Zara laughing] Nope. No, no, no, please, please. -Eden. -Yeah. We're just gonna be here for like five minutes. Okay? This will be so fast. Hey, yo. Phones go in the box. Why? Congressman Schroder lives here. You really think we'd be throwing a party? Here, I'll just, can you put your phone in there, please? You coming in or not? I hate you. We're gonna get them back, right? After the party, smart girls. Oh, hey. Okay. [Zara] I hate it here. [upbeat music] [boy laughing] Let's go. Okay, I need you to go get Gooch off the table. -What? -Yes. No, Gooch? He's like a horny trust fund baby. Listen, the sooner you do this, the sooner we can go home, okay? -You promise? -I promise. Please? -Okay. -Okay. You got it. All right. -It's going right in. -Sup. Hi. Hi. Yeah, okay. So um... Do you wanna make me a drink or something? -What do I do? -Go. Yeah. Yeah. [chuckling] -Totally. -Great, okay. Alright, I guess it's just me against you two. Whoa, looks like you could use a partner. Un-fucking-believable. So, you play the cello, right? It's called an oboe. What the fuck do you do with an oboe? Get a full ride to Penbrook. What?! Wow! Well, I realize that it's the least competitive scholarship for ivy league schools. And nobody, obviously, plays the oboe, so. But now you're like going for free though, right? -Yeah. -It's like... Really fucking smart. I am fucking smart. [both chuckling] Only way I'm getting into college is if my dad donates like a million dollars, which is not gonna happen. 'Cause he calls me his little fuck-up. So what are you making over there, hmm? Yes, this. It is a gift for your tongue, for your taste buds. Sorry, I'm sorry. For you. Oh fuck. -Good fuck? -Yeah, actually. Actually It's like really good. -You like it? -Yeah. Is this gonna get me fucked up, though? [both laughing] [Girl] Have you seen my sister? Has anybody see my sister?! Did you see her? -You're a liar. -I just told you I didn't. You're all liars! [Girl screaming] [tense music] -Is that Melissa's sister? -You know where she is? Yeah. What about you? Have you seen my sister? [Party girl] This is not a good luck, sweetie. -My god, shut up. -Oh, fuck! Hey, all right, all right. Come on, it's a party! Get her outta here. No, get your hands off me. [tense music] [girl laughs] One of you knows something. I'm not leaving here until I find out -where the fuck my sister is! -That didn't fucking work. You got that?! -Yo. -No, no, don't touch me. Just go take care of this bitch okay? I'll drive her home. I'll take her home. It's in the garage. Okay. I'll be back. [Zara] You okay? Mm-hmm. Tanya, you're home. My sister used to do this. [knocking on door] Tanya. -Are you okay, honey? -I'm fine, Dad. Let's just get you in the house. -Look, I was worried to death. -I'm okay. [pensive music] [horn honking] [Eden] Jesus. [Shroder] Thinking of stealing it? [garage door whirring] Let me show you something. That's what I gotta live up to. If I don't become president, I'll basically be considered a fuck-up. Well, just become president then, right? Can't be that hard. Okay. Ah, you're killing me. Killing me. When my family first landed here, a native chief gave that to my great-great-great grandfather. Right. See this? My great grandfather stole this from a German soldier he killed in World War II. Still works. Wanna hold it? Schroder, so, you know, speaking of your family. Mm-hmm. What do you think about introducing me to your dad? My dad? You're really determined to use me, aren't you? Hmm. What's your pitch? Penbrook has been my dream school for as long as I can remember, and not a single other person in my family has gone to college. I mean, I've had no help. I don't come from money. I haven't had any tutors. I couldn't afford SAT prep. I mean, Schroder, I have done all of this completely on my own, and I'm just wait-listed. And if I could just talk to your dad. [Shroder slow-clapping] That's wonderful. But it's also a lie. You said you've done it completely on your own, If I did hear correctly, and that's not true. 'cause now you need my help. If I could just talk to your dad. [ominous music] Where are you going? We're still on the table, partner. [Shroder] All right, you guys ready to get fucked? [Horned player] All day, bro. All day, let's go. Don't miss, no pressure. Oh! Okay, okay. Hey, you got it, you got it. All right. All you, bro. Well, you know, it was... [Zara shouting indistinctly] Fuck your fucking game. -[Zara] Demon little whores. -Okay. Ok, Zara, jeez. -Hey! -Hey. Hey, what's up? Are you drunk? No. I just had a little one. Hey, Eden? Can we go home now? Yes, we are gonna go home so soon. People are gross here. They are, I know. Can we pause the game for just two minutes? -Two minutes. -You look naked! -Come on. -All right. You got two minutes. Otherwise I'm getting another partner. Okay, that's fine. Okay, I'll be right there. [Zara] Bye. [Zara] Joel, I'm coming for you. -[Eden] No, no, no. -[Zara] What? [Eden] No, we're just gonna take a nap really fast. [Zara] Up here? [Eden] And then we're gonna go home. Yeah? -Oh, look at those douches. -Okay. -Douche! -Oh, God, Zara. -Douche! -No, Zara. You're good. Sorry, sorry, sorry. -He's looking at me. -Okay, come here. Give me your hand. -Woman, give me your hand. -Okay, okay. [Eden] Come on. -Ooh. -Come on. Watch yourself. Steps, one, two. There you go. [tense music] [British accent] How did you get your phones? [Zara laughing] [Eden] Zara. Come on. Let's get you to bed. I don't want a roommate who eats my toothbrush. I want you. I know, that's what I'm working on, okay? -Okay. -Okay. -Eden? -Yeah. I love you. Love you. Just gonna rest a little bit. -You're my best friend. -You're my best friend. I'll be back. -Forever and ever. -I know. [Eden] Love you. [Zara] Love you. [door closes] [boy sighs] Oh, there we go, there we go. -Yeah. -Great. You gonna drink that? Oh. [tense music] Let's go. Let's go! Fuck yeah, bro. Make this cup, I'll make sure my dad writes you that recommendation letter. Really? Okay, okay. Shake on it. [tense music] Okay. Yes! Deal's a deal. Deal's a deal. You're killing me. -You're killing me. -Yes. Okay, I'm gonna go check on my friend, no take-backs! [tense music] Hey, guys. Just chilling with my girl, we're cuddling. Zara, wake up. What are you doing in here? Nothing. I was making sure she was okay. -Okay, Gooch, leave. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Get out! I'm going. I'm sorry. Hey, Zara? [door closes] Hey. Zara, you need to wake up. Zara! [Zara] No. [eerie music] Hey, Zara. [Gooch] Oh, hey, can I come back-- No, Gooch, please. Leave, get out. Get out! [tense music] [people shouting on phone] [Gooch on video] Pass her back, come on, pass her back. Share the wealth, share the wealth. [Gooch shouting] [Gooch] You recognize her? -You recognize her? -[Shroder] What? -What? -Who? [Shroder] Hey. Melissa, right? Come on, shy girl, hang out with us, come on. [boys talking at once] Come on. Hey, we're cool with that. I'll open the door for you. [Melis ...just go home now, right? [Shroder] We got you. Hey. I just wanna go home now, okay? Yeah, going home, yeah, well, we gotta make a couple stops first, but yeah. -What's with the phone? -[Gooch] What do you mean? Just like, ignore him. [Gooch] Look, we're gonna get you home safe. -Yeah. -I promise. Promise, all right? We're the coolest people in the world. [ominous music] [inaudible dialogue] [Gooch] What is that? [Melissa] Can you stop filming me? [Gooch] Yeah. -[Melissa] It's a heart. -[Gooch] A heart? -[Gooch chuckling] -[phone chimes] [Gooch] Yes! Oh! [boys shouting] Melissa, this one's yours. [boys chattering] Y'all ready to roll? Y'all ready to go? [Gooch] Go, go where? We ain't going home. [boys chattering] [Boy] You all right? I just started. [garbled crowd noises] [ominous music] -Whoa! -[Kendra] Shit! [teens laughing] [Gooch] You all right? Can I go home? [Gooch] Oh, that's not my call, sorry. To the coolest people in school. The coolest, the coolest. Why the fuck did you throw that out? [Shroder] You wanna go home? You're not going fucking home, okay? [tense music] -[Melissa] Just gonna go. -[Shroder] Oh, you're gonna go? -Yeah. -Why are you going? Why would you not wanna hang out with us? [tense music] Get in the car. Get in the car. We gotta take her home, so we're gonna go take her home. [Shroder] Get in the car. [tense music] Oh, shit. Shit. Hey, Zara. Hey, Zara, I need you to get up. I need you to get up and help me find a charger, please? Zara. [tense music] -Hey. -Hey. Mind if we come in? Zara actually isn't feeling good, so I don't think she'd like people to see her like this. Right. Yeah. Well, Gooch forgot something, so if we could just come in. What'd you forget, Gooch? Like, I left in... His phone. [Shroder] He left his phone in there. Just trying to get it. [Eden] Got it, okay. I actually think I saw it. I'll just grab it really quick. [Shroder] No, that's fine. No, I'll bring it to you guys. It's fine. [lock clicking] She locked the door. [door rattling] [Shroder] Shit, shit, shit! [Kendra] Will you calm down? It's not like she's got the passcode. [Gooch chuckling nervously] I don't have a passcode. What the hell is wrong with you? You're fucking killing me. I kept forgetting it, guys. Who the fuck doesn't have a passcode? [Shroder] Eden. You okay in there? Yeah, yeah, I'm just helping Zara. Sorry, just gimme a second. How about I come in there and grab the phone, okay? Schroder, do your parents have a charger in here? Did the phone die or something? I just wanna charge it up so I can call my dad to come pick us up. Yes. Yes, I think that's a wonderful idea. Come on out, we'll give you your phone so you can call your dad. I don't wanna leave Zara in here by herself, so why don't you just give me the phone charger under the door. I can help. Let me help. -I can help. -No. I think you've done enough. [Schroder clears throat] Yeah, that'd be a little weird though, right? To give you a charger when you could just come out here and get your phone. Schroder, I saw the video. [tense music] What? Stop. Stop. Come on now. Mm. What, uh... What video? I saw you with Melissa on Friday. I thought you said the phone died. It did. So you didn't see the whole video. I saw enough of it. Schroder, where is she? The last time that we saw Melissa Brown is when we dropped her off at her house. I swear to God. Okay, if that's the truth, then give me a charger and let me finish watching the video. I'm not sliding a charger under the door, even though-- I'm not leaving this room until you give me a charger and I finish watching the video. I think you're gonna think this is all really silly once you see this video. Why don't you come on out? Charge up the phone, give you your phone, and then we'll all watch the video together, okay? How does that sound, Eden? Is that good for you? You wanna be reasonable, give me a charger in the next 30 seconds or I'm gonna scream. 30. 29. -What we fucking doing, man? -28. 27! 26. 25. 24! 23. 22. 21. [tense music] [partiers chattering] [rhythmic electronic music] [music volume increases] Everyone! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck outta my house! [people shouting indistinctly] [loud electronic music playing] Zara. Zara, come on, I need you to wake up. Please, Zara, please wake up. Get the fuck outta here! Get the fuck out of my house! [Schroder shouting indistinctly] Zara, come on. Come on, I need you to wake up. -[tense music] -[cars departing quickly] -Get outta here! -Shit! Go on, get out! Go on, come on! [Eden grunting] Wait! Wait! Hey, please wait! Hey! Wait, wait! No! [tense music] -[music stops suddenly] -[Eden breathing heavily] Schroder? Schroder? Schroder? -[footstep thuds] -[tense music] [music stops] [tense drum beats] [inaudible dialogue] -[drumbeats stop] -[Eden panting] -[tense music] -No. [wire creaking] [Eden grunting] -Fuck! -[music stops] -[tense music] -[Eden panting] She broke my fucking nose, man! Hey. [Shroder] Keep your fucking voice down. Look what you've done. Look what you've done, Gooch. Go downstairs. Get cleaned up, now. 'Cause you wanna help, right? You wanna help? Then fucking go! Now! Don't get blood on my carpet. [tense music] Fuck. [Gooch panting] [Eden grunting] [Gooch grunting] [Eden grunting] [Gooch grunting] [Eden groans] Is this really your smartest idea? Good point. You do it. No way. I hurt my shoulder, I'm done. Oh, Kendra, you'd like, perpetrate this door like so easy. Of course I could. But I'm not risking my athletic career for this bullshit. [Shroder] Athletic career? Let's be clear on something, all right? No one's gonna remember shit about either one of you two if they see this video. If they see this video, it's fucking over, all right? Get up and knock this fucking door down. No, man, I'm pretty fucked up, I can't. I want you to think about your father's face... When he finds out that you're part of all of this. Think about how disappointed he's going to be when he realizes he was right. Oh. You're exactly the fuck-up he always thought you'd be. [tense music] -[Gooch shouting] -[suspenseful music] [Gooch grunts] [Gooch panting] I'm fucking empty, dude. Move out the way. [Kendra shouts] Get up, come on, come on, come on, come on. Get up, get up, get up. Listen. Look at me, look at me, look at me. I need you to go around, all right? I need you to get the ladder and get the phone, okay? All right? I need you to do this for me. I need you. I need you. Make me proud, all right? Come on. You good? -You good? -Yeah. I believe in you. Get that shit. [tense music] -[Kendra grunts] -[ominous music] [wardrobe thuds] Eden! Yo, Eden, what the fuck is this? Hey, Schroder? Schroder! I would stop banging on that, dude, like, this thing looks really expensive. -What the fuck! -Fuck! [Schroder groaning] Zara, Zara. Thank God you're awake. I don't feel so good. Zara, get up, get up, come help me, please. Zara, please get up. Zara, get the fuck up! [Zara vomiting and coughing] Oh, shit, man! God dammit, that thing's too heavy. We're not getting in. We're not trying to get in. [tense music] [banging on window] [tense music] Gooch, what are you doing out there? Okay. Hey, Zara. Hey. Hey. I threw up, don't-- -You what? -I threw up. Your drink. Here, sit down, sit down. Okay. Oh. You okay? -What happened? -Why are you here? I gotta do something. Just say hi to Eden really fast. Okay? Oh yeah, okay. -[Zara groans] -You go and rest. Oh, why? [Eden shouting] Ok, ok, stop! Shroder! -[Gooch] It'll be okay. -[Eden shouting indistinctly] I will be right back. Okay. [Schroder] Eden! [tense music] Hey, Eden. -Look. -[Shroder] Let us in! I'm really sorry about all this. Just please gimme the phone back. [Eden] How'd you get it here? I don't want anyone else to get hurt, okay? -Please give the phone back. -[Eden] No. -And all this can be over. -[Eden] No. -Come on, Eden. -[Eden] No. Give the fucking phone back! -Stay the fuck away. -Come on! -Stay back! -Give me it back! [Gooch grunts] Fuck! Fucking phone. Just give me back the fucking phone and this can all be over! Where is it, Eden?! [Zara] Gooch? What are you doing? She won't gimme back my phone. Zara. You mean this phone? [Schroder] Get it. [Gooch mumbling] [Gooch] Shroder, I got it, I got the phone! -[chair cracking] -[Eden grunting] [Eden] Let go! Let go! Shroder! [Schroder] Oh, you crazy fucking bitch! [thudding] [Kendra] Oh, she's got the phone! [Schroder shouts] Fuck you. -Fucking bitch. -[music intensifies] Fucking bitch! [feet thudding] [Kendra] What now, hmm? [tense music] Let's fucking go. Oh hey, are you kids with that party over on Northgate? My daughter's there too, I was just wondering if it's still going on? Nah, got broken up, it's fucking lame. Yeah, super boring. [tense music] Aww, shit, let's fucking go. [Kendra] Let's fucking go. This... This is what I'm talking about. [Kendra] Zara, Zara, come here. I need you, I need you to help me get his arms. -[Zara] What? -[Eden] Help me get his arms. -Help me get his arms! -[Kendra] Oh yeah! Here we go. Fuck yes! Woo!

Come here. Hey. What are you doing? What does it fucking look like? -No. -What? You can't get a new door? I don't want to spend my whole weekend shopping for doors. [water running] [water continues to run] Let's make a deal, Eden. [Shroder] Give me the phone and I'll let you leave. How's that? [Eden] Get up. What the fuck? What's going on in there, Gooch? -[hairdryer blowing] -[Gooch] Uh... [Gooch] So, I'm in a tub and she's got a hair dryer and... Fuck, man, I think they're gonna electrocute me! Okay. [Shroder] Let's think on this, okay? Let's breathe. Let's calm down. No, dude, no, please, please, please. Just get outta here, guys, help me. [hairdryer blowing] Are you seriously crying right now? Shut up. [Shroder] Hey, you're not a killer. Okay? You're just a scholarship kid-- [Eden] Get the fucking phone, Kendra! [Shroder] Fine. Yes. I'm sending Kendra now. Let's just not do anything stupid, okay? We don't want anyone getting hurt. [Eden] Kendra, hurry! -Eden, stop. -[hairdryer blowing] Fine. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. It's not fucking fine! -It's not fucking fine! -It's gonna be fine. What the fuck? Dude, we're not killers. We're not fucking killers. What the fuck are you doing? We need to get the fuck out of this bathroom. How are we gonna get the fuck outta this bathroom? We're gonna figure it out. [stammering] I just wanted to take her home. I told Shroder but he doesn't listen to me. [Eden] Listen, I need you to tell me where she is. He's never listened to me. [Eden] I need you to tell me where Melissa is. Wait. This was all about Melissa? [Gooch sniveling] If you want get out of this, you have to give him what he wants. Just give him the phone back and this can all be over. [blowdryer shuts off] -How did he get in here? -[Gooch sobbing] He came in through the window. Okay, okay, the window. The window. We're gonna go through the window. -What?! -Okay. No, no, no, no. I need you to go through the window. Are you serious? No way is that safe. What if it slips? Do you wanna get asked instead, Zara? That's our only option. Listen to me, listen to me, okay?

[Kendra mumbling] I don't want your pills, man, I don't want your pills. Fucking-- I don't want your pills. [sobbing] Look at me. I'm gonna die. After all we've been through you can't leave me like this. You can't leave me like this, you're my best friend. Please. -Stop fucking crying, okay! -Fuck off! Oh, shit! [Kendra crying] [Kendra mumbling] -Fuck! -[pills clattering] [Kendra] You can't leave me, man. I'm gonna die. [Kendra crying] You're my best friend, man. I have to get that phone. No, fuck the phone. No, no. Oh, fuck. You can't leave me, you can't. No, Schro, Schro! [Kendra mumbling] Best friend. And then the phone died. So all you saw was Melissa getting in Schroder's car. Zara, are you not listening? They were with her the night that she disappeared. So? That doesn't prove anything. It proves that they lied to the cops and that they know where she is. You don't know that for sure. My god. -Are you serious? -Look. If this is what you think it is, we're not getting out until we give them that phone. I know. That's why this is going to the police. No, we have to give it back to them. Look, we can tell the police ourselves, but right now we need to get the fuck out of here. Zara, his dad is a congressman. [Zara] So? So? Can you think about that, for a second? Who are we? You really think anyone's gonna believe us over them? This is the only chance we have to help find her. We have to take this to the police. Eden. Give me the phone. [scoffs] Give me the phone. No. -No! -Give me the phone! -Zara! -Give me the phone! Zara! [girls shouting indistinctly] [insects chirping] [girls shouting indistinctly] [insects chirping] [girls shouting indistinctly] [insects chirping] Hello? -Zara. -Let go! Fuck, Zara. No! Zara. Ow! Eden? [girls grunting] Please, Zara! Eden, stop! [insects chirping] Give it to me! Eden! You up there, sweetheart? Fuck! Please. Zara, please, that is the only proof we have. I don't care about proof. I wanna go home! [Dad] Eden? Dad? Is that you, sweetheart? Oh my god, Dad, what are you doing here? What the hell happened here? -[suspenseful music] -[Eden screaming] No! No! Eden, run! -No! -[clattering] Get the fuck off me. It's over! Now it's my turn to count. You've got 10 seconds to give me back that phone. Schroder, stop! I split your daddy's head wide open! Ten! Nine! Sweetheart, just give him his phone, all right? Eight! -[Zara] Stop, stop, stop! -Seven! I have it, Schroder! Bring it to me. [Shroder] Now! Six! -[Zara] Got it! -Five! [suspenseful music continues] Fuck. You. You know, Eden, I don't think I'm gonna invite you to any more of my parties. [man] Barrett Theodore Schroder. -What's going on here? -[Shroder] Dad. I didn't think you were gonna be home until Sunday. Well, your mother wasn't feeling well. You need to explain everything that's happening now. Right now. Yes. Well, you see, me and some of my friends were just having little get-together, and things got out of hand, but I've got it all under control now, everything's cool, it's all cool, everything's cool. No, everything is definitely not cool, young man. I just think we all need to take a deep breath. Are you fucking shitting me? It's her fault. She started all of this. She stole Gooch's phone and... Her fault? -Her fault? -[Shroder] Yes. When I walked into this mad house, you were chasing my daughter around with an ax! Mr. Murphy. I'm happy we have this opportunity to talk this over. [Joel] Talk? You better start explaining a few things, or I'm gonna go talk to the cops, all right? Oh. [laughing] Not necessary. How did this get so out of control, Barrett? I was just trying to protect you, that's all. I know this is a big year with the election and everything, and I just didn't-- The only person he's been trying to protect is himself. I've seen the video. Dad, don't listen to her-- [Eden] Did you know he has a video on his phone? [Shroder] Dad-- Of Melissa Brown being forced into his car the night that she disappeared? [Joel] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this got to do with that? What? Gooch, Gooch, come on, talk to my parents. Tell them the truth. You know what happened. [Eden] What happened, Schroder? [Shroder] Tell them. It is your phone, Gooch. Gooch? Why don't you just tell us what's on it? Why don't you? [Shroder] Tell them. Fucking tell them. Fucking pussy, goddamn. Why don't you find a charger for that? Watch the video yourselves. Good luck getting into Penbrook, bitch. [Astrid] Oh, excuse me? -Did you- -Barrett. Excuse me? Did you not hear him? He said, "good luck getting into Penbrook, bitch." Okay, well that's not the way we're raising this house, is it, Barrett?! You respect women in this house. You have to apologize. Apologize? For what? [Astrid] Apologize! Barrett. I'm sorry, Mom. Not to me, asshole. I'm sorry, Eden. -[Astrid] Thank you. -Un-fucking-believable. Excuse me. So. What exactly did you see, Eden? She didn't see shit. I saw enough to know that your son and Gooch and Kendra are hiding something massive. Oh. [Shroder] Hiding something massive. And uh... Where is Kendra? Kendra. Kendra! No. Hey. [Congressman] Son. What? -Dad? -I'm here. [Schroder] Let's call her an ambulance. Oh, I'm so sorry. [Schroder mumbling] [Schroder] Need to call an ambulance. [Congressman] Will you say something to your son? What do you want me to say? Do you want me to say it's all gonna be okay? That this little mess up of his is acceptable? Did you want me to feel sorry for him? I just want you tell me how to fix it. You amaze me. After all these years, you still haven't figured it out. No matter what anybody says, they're only going to do what's best for them. Not this one. She's different. Nah, you just think she is. Hmm. [quiet sobbing] Darling, thank you. I'd like to begin by apologizing to each of you for everything that my son did this evening. Barrett knows better. I don't know quite how everything got so out of control. That is not how our family handles things. Thank you. Mr. Murphy. You own a a septic tank company? Yeah. Is that a good-- well sure it is, everybody shits. Do you know, the county is accepting bids for the new municipal contracts. I think in order to make amends for this evening, my husband would be more than willing to talk to his friends on the board, if that's something that you would be interested in? And do I understand that you have a scholarship to Penbrook in the fall? Well, that's impressive. Unfortunately, a lot of those scholarships don't cover all the costs. [Astrid] Oh. Oh my husband and I love supporting underprivileged students. So this might help me feel like you're on a little more equal footing with the other students next year. [Congressman] And that way you can focus on your studies instead of all these annoying financial distractions. [Astrid] Ah, true. -[Zara] Oh. -I know. [Astrid] Yeah. [Congressman] Yeah. -[Astrid] Huh. -[Congressman] Yeah. You can't just buy us off. Oh, well. I think we just-- We're not doing that at all. The character that you've shown tonight is just express that you are the exact kind of bright young woman that belongs at Penbrook. Oh, yes. If you wanted to go to that school, that wouldn't be a problem at all. Couple of phone calls. But we would to have to have our agreement in place. Sure. -Eden. -What? Don't. We can't make any decisions until we see what else is on that phone. It doesn't matter. What do you mean? [Astrid] Miss, your friend is right. No matter what you do, it is not going to change what transpired. [Zara] That municipal contract. It's a big deal, right? We have been trying to get one for years. [Zara] How much is it worth? We wouldn't have to worry about money anymore. [Zara] And your dad could finally afford his surgery. You wouldn't have to watch him limp around every day. Penbrook is all we have talked about since we were kids. I know. And I need you there with me next year. We can't let them get away with this. My son, I assure you, will be dealt with appropriately. You have my word. You're on my side, right? I mean, you, you have to think about Melissa's family. -What about your family? -Zara. [Joel] It's your decision, sweetheart. We're not making a deal until we watch that video. [horn honking in video] [Gooch in video] Schro. Look at her, dude, you're fucking scaring the shit out of her. Can we just let her go home? [Schroder] Fuck, shut up! -[Shroder] Hey, hey, hey, hey! -[Kendra] Dude, you're drunk. You're fucking drunk. [Gooch] Bro, you're gonna fucking hit her! [Schroder] Fuck this bitch. [Gooch] Dude, no, don't... [Kendra] Dude, no. [Schroder] Bro, get your hand off the wheel. [Gooch] Schroder, please just fucking pull over... [Kendra] You gotta chill out, man. [Gooch] before you do something fucking stupid. -[girl screams] -[Gooch] Hey, hey watch out! [thumping and yelling] -[Kendra] What the fuck?! -[Gooch] What the fuck?! [Kendra] Holy shit! [Gooch] Schroder, what the fuck was that?! [Kendra] Oh, shit. [Gooch] You just fucking ran over her! [insects chirping] [Kendra] Fucking shit, bro! [Gooch] What the fuck! [Shroder] Shit. Shit. [both grunt] [water splashing] That's what I was trying to save you. You're too young to make a decision that difficult. It's not really that hard of a decision. We're gonna leave and I'm taking the phone with me. Let's go. Barrett. [Schroder] Where do you think you're going? [Joel] Back your ass up, son. -Zara. -I don't feel so good. I think they've done something to us. Barrett, Barrett, Barrett. [Eden] Hey, come on. [solemn music] [Eden] Come on. Come on. Think about it, Eden. Would you rather four years in prison or four years in the college of your dreams? [Joel] Prison? What's he talking about? [Eden] It doesn't matter, come on. These girls are responsible for a young woman's death. Kendra's dead? Unfortunately. [Zara] But it wasn't our fault. It was self-defense. Well, I'm sure that's what your lawyer will argue, but it might be a little bit difficult finding one. I know every prosecutor, DA, and judge in the county, and I'll see to it that you serve the maximum sentence. [tense music] [Shroder] Kendra's dead. This is all your fault. Go get that phone, okay? [tense music] Get it yourself. [Eden] Come on. Zara. -[Eden] Dad? -[Joel] I got it. -Dad? -I got it. No, no, no. [Eden grunting] Dad, she's getting away. Barrett. [solemn music] Oh. [Zara and Eden panting] You didn't really think that I would let you hurt my family, did you? [eerie music] [Shroder] Hey. There you are. It's okay. [Eden] What did you do? Lorazepam and propofol. At high enough doses, it induces you into temporary paralysis. Trust me, I know. My parents used to slip it in my food and drink when I was a kid. I wanted to tell the police. But Mother wouldn't have it. [insects chirping] [eerie music] You don't have to do this. I do. You don't. [eerie music] -[Eden sobbing] -Don't cry. Please, you don't have to do this. It's okay. It's okay. [Eden grunting] Come on, son. Get outta the car. [tense music] Schroder. No. Gooch. Put Kendra in the trunk. Why? Because she's got a hole in her and it deserves an explanation. I can't. I'm sorry? Gooch? Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't shoot your little film. Go on with it. [tense music] -[liquor sloshing] -[Joel grunting] [Schroder] Come on. Do you know, Eden... You'd have done really, really good at Penbrook. I should know. I was a scholarship girl myself. [Eden whimpering] Please. Night night. [tense music] -[flesh squelching] -[blood squirting] [Gooch gagging] -[Gooch sputtering] -[tense music continues] [water splashing] [water rushing] [girls coughing] [Eden] Come on! [girls coughing] [Eden groaning] Dad? Dad. [tense music] [girls grunt] [birds chirping] Eden, this isn't the way. We need to go to the police. We will. [eerie music] [Zara crying] [reporter talking indistinctly] Less than one hour ago, a car careened off Winslow Road and plunged into Tillery River. Authorities have recovered three bodies from inside the car, a man and two teenagers. Warning, some of these images are distressing. A police correspondent called the deaths, quote, "unfortunate." Preliminary findings had attributed this to an alcohol related incident, but as you can see behind me, this is still a very active scene. What was at first deemed an accident now looks like there's some suspicious activity involving stab wounds onto the bodies, indicating some degree of foul play. [eerie music] Hello, angel. [suspenseful music] [tense music] [Eden shouts] -[flesh squelching] -[Eden screaming] [both grunting] [Eden gasping] [water splashing] [Eden breathing heavily] [eerie music] [electricity sizzling and popping] [Eden grunts] [Eden panting] [tense music] [gun clicks] Mom. [car horn honking outside] [horn honks, engine revs] Get the fuck outta my car, you fucking bitch! I'm gonna fucking kill you. [engine revving] -[engine racing] -[tires squeal] Fuck you, Eden! [gunshot bangs] [Eden shouting] [Eden gasping] [tense music] [Eden shouts] [Eden shouts] [eerie music] -[cracking noises] -[Schroder groans] [Eden chuckles] -[Schroder groaning] -[eerie music] [Schroder wheezing] [Eden panting] School's gonna be real weird on Monday. No, no. [Zara shouts] [thudding] [Schroder groaning] Asshole. Oh my god. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Yeah, yeah. [Eden grunting in pain] Okay. Okay. [Zara mumbles] You're killing me. [eerie music] I'm gonna get you home, okay? -Okay. -Okay. Okay. [birds chirping] [Eden whimpering] [solemn music] [bird chirping] [siren wailing] [pensive music] [tense music]
